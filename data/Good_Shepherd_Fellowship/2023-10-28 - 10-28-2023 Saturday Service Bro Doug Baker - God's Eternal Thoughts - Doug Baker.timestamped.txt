[48:16] Tucson
[48:17] Arizona we just went through a a
[48:21] record-breaking summer where we had I
[48:24] think almost 100 days we're over 100°
[48:27] and I was praying for some cool weather
[48:30] be careful what you pray
[48:33] for well it's so nice to be here with
[48:36] you we we um um want to thank you first
[48:39] of all for sharing your pastor with us
[48:41] um I don't I was trying to remember U
[48:44] Brother Juan it was maybe 10 years ago
[48:47] or somewhere around there where you you
[48:49] came to tcon and we were having meetings
[48:50] in a a uh we rented a hotel and we had
[48:54] some meetings and that's when I met your
[48:57] pastor was love at first sight and um uh
[49:02] we understand that you've done the same
[49:04] kind of thing over the years uh here as
[49:06] well and uh just trying to bring people
[49:09] together and let the Lord get glory and
[49:11] let us all go further in the Lord and
[49:14] and um so that was our our first um um
[49:19] introduction to our dear brother um and
[49:23] then he came and ministered at our
[49:25] special meetings and uh two Services the
[49:28] first and the last there were some
[49:30] there's some things that happened that
[49:32] kind of rearranged the order those
[49:34] things happen but it worked out that
[49:36] that's how it was supposed to be and uh
[49:39] so our brother brought a wonderful
[49:40] message on the burden of change and and
[49:43] then he finished up with give me
[49:44] children lest I die and it was just a uh
[49:49] you know you know your pastor so I don't
[49:51] have to tell you about your pastor but I
[49:53] watched him as he skill F laid out his
[49:56] you know like a builder he's laying out
[49:58] all of his tools and getting everything
[50:00] ready and then he went to work and built
[50:03] a a masterpiece for us and it was just a
[50:06] tied right in with the other services
[50:08] and just really anointed wonderful
[50:11] thoughts
[50:12] that in order for there to be a change
[50:15] it's God's idea for the change but God
[50:17] puts the burden on your heart and then
[50:20] you feel it you experience it you think
[50:22] it's all you but it's God putting that
[50:24] on your heart so that he can bring the
[50:26] change and just it's encouraging and and
[50:30] a very wonderful thought so um we thank
[50:33] our pastor for inviting us to be here
[50:36] with you this weekend and um I apologize
[50:39] that Sister Baker couldn't be with us um
[50:42] something came up and had something
[50:44] scheduled um and she wasn't able to make
[50:47] it she normally um is able to come to a
[50:50] lot of the meetings if I when I go
[50:53] out I have to just tell you a little bit
[50:56] about myself so that so that you can
[50:59] relax and then we can preach the word
[51:00] here tonight uh been pastoring a a
[51:04] church in Tucson for 29 years now uh I
[51:08] have three children that are serving the
[51:10] lord five grandchildren I have my
[51:12] youngest son is
[51:14] uh uh he's taken up Trucking this year
[51:17] and I think he's the closest he's been
[51:20] to me in a while he's about 300 miles
[51:22] away or so he's over in Rockford uh
[51:24] Illinois I was hoping that maybe he'd
[51:27] come by and be able to be with us in
[51:29] service but um didn't work out
[51:35] um I I lived in grandforks North Dakota
[51:38] from
[51:39] um that's North Dakota from 1969 to
[51:45] 19726 uh or excuse me 1969 to
[51:48] 1972 um the Air Force Base there it was
[51:52] a missile base and uh my dad was a
[51:54] launch control officer for the minut man
[51:56] missiles so we we lived through the the'
[52:00] 60s the Cold War never knowing if the
[52:03] buttons going to get pushed and on
[52:05] either side it was a those of you that
[52:08] got hair my color you know what it was
[52:10] like it was a very nervous
[52:12] time and I think Grand Forks was just
[52:16] about the coldest place in the southern
[52:19] 48 the lower 48 states um I think
[52:22] International Falls Minnesota was the
[52:24] only place that was colder
[52:25] I don't know anybody that lives there
[52:27] but um so we we lived there four years
[52:30] we lived in um Great Falls Montana for
[52:33] four years we lived in Rapid City South
[52:35] Dakota all missile bases and then eight
[52:38] other states and so people ask me uh
[52:42] where are you from and I don't know I
[52:44] just tell them I'm from the mind of
[52:46] God born in Massachusetts but couldn't
[52:49] tell you anything about it lived in 30
[52:51] different homes um so we've lived in
[52:54] Tucson now um this year is 30 years so
[52:58] that's home that's the long as I've
[53:00] lived
[53:01] anywhere if the Lord teres I I have no
[53:04] plans to move so it's uh anyway it's a
[53:08] it's a real privilege to be here with
[53:10] you we we uh we just want to be an
[53:13] encouragement we just want
[53:15] to bring something from God's word that
[53:18] might be a help to you and we certainly
[53:20] don't want to be a burden to the pastor
[53:21] we want to be a help to the pastor so if
[53:24] I say something that doesn't quite sound
[53:25] right just allow it to my ignorance
[53:27] because I don't intend to just some
[53:30] simple thoughts but as as Peter said uh
[53:34] he wanted to stir up your pure
[53:35] remembrance and I think if we can if we
[53:37] can do that um um we will be we'll be
[53:42] happy so I would like to read um from
[53:47] two portions of scripture here first of
[53:49] all very familiar scripture Philippians
[53:51] chapter 4 and the 8th verse and then
[53:54] we're going to read from
[53:56] Jeremiah 29:
[54:00] 8-14 Philippians chapter 4 and verse
[54:05] 8 finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[54:09] true whatsoever things are honest
[54:11] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[54:14] things are pure whatsoever things are
[54:16] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[54:19] report if there be any virtue and if
[54:22] there be any praise think on these
[54:24] things
[54:26] we're living in a time when it's just
[54:27] negative everywhere but we've got a lot
[54:30] of things to be thankful for as a song
[54:32] leader
[54:34] said we have a lot of things to praise
[54:36] him for and there's a lot of positive
[54:37] things to to meditate on and to think
[54:40] about I'd like to read from Jeremiah
[54:42] chapter 29 also starting from the e8th
[54:46] verse Jeremiah
[54:48] 29:8 for thus sayith the Lord of hosts
[54:50] the god of Israel let not your prophets
[54:53] and your divers that be in the midst of
[54:55] you deceive you neither hearken to your
[54:58] dreams which he caused to be dreamed for
[55:01] they prophesy falsely unto you in my
[55:03] name I have not sent them sayeth the
[55:05] Lord for thus sayeth the Lord that after
[55:09] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I
[55:12] will visit you and perform my good word
[55:16] toward you in causing you to return to
[55:18] this place for I know the thoughts that
[55:21] I think towards you sayeth the Lord
[55:24] thoughts of peace
[55:26] not of evil to give you an expected
[55:31] end then shall you call upon me and you
[55:33] shall go and pray unto me and I will
[55:35] hearken unto you and ye shall seek me
[55:39] and find me when you shall search for me
[55:41] with all your heart and I will be found
[55:44] of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn
[55:46] away your captivity and I will gather
[55:49] you from all the nations and from all
[55:51] the places whether I have driven you
[55:53] sayeth the Lord and I I will bring you
[55:55] again into the place whence I caus you
[55:59] to be carried away captive may the Lord
[56:02] add his Blessing to the reading the word
[56:03] should we bow our
[56:06] heads father as
[56:08] we as we read from your word here
[56:11] tonight we know that anybody can read
[56:12] from your word but father we're looking
[56:14] to you you're the author of it we're
[56:16] asking Lord for you to break your the
[56:19] bread of life down to us tonight father
[56:22] we we ask that you would speak and then
[56:24] we ask Lord that you would also hear
[56:27] tonight it's it's the very same spirit
[56:30] that we're looking to give us unction to
[56:32] speak and it's the very same Spirit to
[56:35] teach us the things that we've heard
[56:37] down in our hearts and then Lord we ask
[56:39] that you would cause it to live that you
[56:41] would cause your word to manifest in our
[56:43] lives we didn't come here to be
[56:44] entertained we didn't come here to uh Al
[56:47] although we we we love being around one
[56:50] another we love being with one another
[56:52] we treasure that but we came to be with
[56:54] with you Lord and we came to hear the
[56:57] words of life tonight and we have
[56:59] confidence tonight Lord that you have
[57:00] exactly what we what we need so we're
[57:03] surrendering to you Lord from the pulpit
[57:05] to the back door and we're asking you
[57:07] Lord to just have your way we love you
[57:09] and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name
[57:12] amen amen amen you may be seated so I
[57:15] want to title the thought here tonight
[57:18] um excuse me for a moment God's Eternal
[57:22] thoughts God's Eternal thoughts thought
[57:25] so first of all we know that God wants
[57:28] his children to know I know my thoughts
[57:31] concerning you and we can argue with it
[57:34] we can wrestle with it or we can accept
[57:37] it that that's his word to us God has
[57:40] thoughts concerning you and his he had
[57:44] these thoughts concerning you before
[57:45] there was before he created one atom one
[57:48] molecule and God knows his thoughts
[57:50] concerning you and they are not of evil
[57:53] but they are of peace
[57:55] and he has an expected end for you God
[57:59] wants you to know tonight that his mind
[58:01] is made up he's not in the process of
[58:03] making up his mind he's made up his
[58:06] mind but he started all through he
[58:08] started all through from from the start
[58:11] to the finish and he hasn't placed you
[58:13] here on a trial basis to see what you're
[58:15] going to do he knows what you're going
[58:16] to do he has a plan for you and he will
[58:20] accomplish his plan concerning you your
[58:23] part is to surrender
[58:25] to his will for your life and of course
[58:27] we know his word is his will for our
[58:30] lives so you I want you to know tonight
[58:33] uh Emanuel you don't have a surprise
[58:35] ending to your life God isn't going to
[58:38] say whoops I didn't see that coming I
[58:41] worked on you and worked on you but boy
[58:43] I got surprised there at the
[58:45] end the end of the story is they lived
[58:48] happily ever after God has a purpose God
[58:51] has a a plan and his plan will not be to
[58:54] defeated his plan will not be no matter
[58:56] what the devil does God's in control how
[58:58] many believes that so we don't serve a
[59:01] god tonight that's learning I wouldn't
[59:03] want to serve a god like that that's
[59:05] that's getting smarter and better and
[59:06] that's making mistakes we make mistakes
[59:09] but he thought it all out and it's
[59:11] perfect and it's he's not ringing his
[59:13] hands he's not nervous it's all taking
[59:15] place exactly as he planned for it to
[59:18] take place from the message the
[59:21] infallibility of God's spoken word uh
[59:24] April 4th 1956 brother Bram said and
[59:27] when I was coming over I was thinking of
[59:29] this the infallibility of God's spoken
[59:31] word it's just perfect and if we could
[59:34] only if this audience tonight could only
[59:36] get that settled in our mind of who said
[59:39] this and what this really is this spoken
[59:42] word we'd not need any healing service
[59:46] not need any salvation altar call it
[59:48] would be finished if you just realize
[59:50] what that word was he says now let's
[59:53] look at it before it could be a word
[59:56] spoken it has to be a thought and
[59:58] because a word is a thought made
[1:00:00] manifest when God speaks now back in the
[1:00:03] beginning when God looked down through
[1:00:04] the corridors of heaven and saw all the
[1:00:06] things that were going to happen on the
[1:00:08] earth did you ever set and just draw a
[1:00:11] picture out in your mind he says now
[1:00:14] that's the way God did it perhaps in the
[1:00:16] beginning and then it seemed good to him
[1:00:19] so he spoke it and as soon as it was
[1:00:21] spoken it became a word the was
[1:00:25] expressed in a word now listen once God
[1:00:28] expresses his thought and makes it a
[1:00:30] word it can he can never take it back
[1:00:33] that word will not return into him void
[1:00:35] he can never take it back oh my you see
[1:00:37] it he can't back up on it he can't say
[1:00:40] well I'm sorry I made a mistake he can't
[1:00:44] he's infallible he's omniscient he's
[1:00:47] omnipotent he's omnipresent see you and
[1:00:51] I as we grow along we become educated
[1:00:53] and smart and everything we advance the
[1:00:56] human race Advance everything advances
[1:00:59] but God he was perfect to begin with he
[1:01:03] will be perfect when it's all over he's
[1:01:06] still perfect he can't say well I got a
[1:01:09] better way of doing it because I've
[1:01:10] learned more he was perfect to start
[1:01:14] with and if he said he was the lamb
[1:01:16] slain from before the foundation of the
[1:01:18] world that's the very moment that God
[1:01:20] perceived the thought and the thought
[1:01:22] was created by God himself
[1:01:24] and every time God makes a thought it is
[1:01:27] a creation when he speaks it it becomes
[1:01:29] a reality so every word of this Bible is
[1:01:33] God's spoken creative thought every time
[1:01:36] it's taken into the right ground it'll
[1:01:38] be made manifest amen then all the
[1:01:41] Spooks drop away every shadow moves and
[1:01:44] we stand anchored and nothing can shake
[1:01:47] that from you see all the superstitions
[1:01:49] and ups and downs has passed away then
[1:01:52] we're right on the word God can't do do
[1:01:54] nothing but honor that word he has to
[1:01:57] keep it it's him the word is God the
[1:02:00] Bible said it was and it's God's Eternal
[1:02:03] Everlasting word and to know how perfect
[1:02:07] he is then how can he act this way in
[1:02:10] this crisis and then turn around and
[1:02:12] deny that and act in another way in the
[1:02:15] same crisis amen so hope you don't mind
[1:02:18] that I take that as a little background
[1:02:20] here tonight we we believe that's our
[1:02:22] Authority is the word of God and we
[1:02:24] believe his quote book was the
[1:02:27] Bible so it's a matter then friends of
[1:02:30] Us coming to the recognition of who and
[1:02:32] what we are and what we've been placed
[1:02:35] here for just as with the bridegroom the
[1:02:38] firstborn of the new creation we find
[1:02:41] ourselves in the volume of the book you
[1:02:42] are in the word the word speaks of you
[1:02:45] the word describes you and then when we
[1:02:48] find ourselves in the volume of the book
[1:02:51] then we say be it unto me according to
[1:02:53] the prophecy
[1:02:54] may I be that ground I Surrender let it
[1:02:57] be me we look Satan right in the eye and
[1:02:59] we tell him I have no part in you and
[1:03:02] you have no part in me and then we walk
[1:03:04] in the prophecy concerning us now we
[1:03:07] used to I'm speaking of myself and and
[1:03:10] others in my generation we used to think
[1:03:13] in the early days of our walk in the
[1:03:14] message we used to think that the
[1:03:16] message came to us so that we could
[1:03:19] become uh what the message declared that
[1:03:22] an end time believer would be now
[1:03:24] I suppose we got that kind of thinking
[1:03:26] from the denominations I was raised in
[1:03:28] the Baptist Church and it was all about
[1:03:30] trying to be what the Bible said right
[1:03:34] but then when he made himself known to
[1:03:36] us when he revealed himself as the
[1:03:39] present tense I am we come to recognize
[1:03:42] that we're not trying to become anything
[1:03:44] we we realize that we are the prophecy
[1:03:48] that word has come to us to wake us up
[1:03:50] to show us who and what we are and we
[1:03:53] are the written word that's being made
[1:03:55] flesh in this hour we are God's Eternal
[1:03:57] thought that then became word that's now
[1:03:59] becoming flesh how wonderful that is how
[1:04:02] blessed we are what a privilege it is
[1:04:05] tonight to be part of God's great plan
[1:04:07] we didn't choose to be part of his plan
[1:04:09] he chose us to be in his plan and what a
[1:04:12] privilege it is to be living out the the
[1:04:15] thoughts of almighty God himself we are
[1:04:19] actually God's answer to Satan's
[1:04:21] challenge today in Satan's Eden God put
[1:04:24] you here and he said have you considered
[1:04:26] my servant Juan have you considered my
[1:04:28] my young brother Emanuel have you
[1:04:30] considered my young sisters amen this
[1:04:34] message illuminates you this message
[1:04:37] shows you who you were who you are we
[1:04:39] didn't know who we
[1:04:41] were and we see that it's a
[1:04:43] time uh uh as we're reading from we we
[1:04:46] took our text here tonight from Jeremiah
[1:04:48] chapter 29 we see that it was a time
[1:04:51] when uh Israel was about to go into
[1:04:53] bondage AG Israel was about to be
[1:04:56] carried away into Babylon and they were
[1:04:58] about to lose everything that they had
[1:05:01] they were about to lose their homes they
[1:05:03] were about to lose their jobs their
[1:05:04] Vineyards their place of
[1:05:06] worship everything that was dear to them
[1:05:09] they were about to lose it but Jeremiah
[1:05:11] being the voice of God at that time
[1:05:13] among them he began to comfort the
[1:05:15] people with the word of the Lord he
[1:05:18] assured them that God was in complete
[1:05:21] control of that present situation and
[1:05:24] even in this great ter great terrible
[1:05:27] time that they were living in he was
[1:05:29] able to comfort them and he let them
[1:05:32] know that even before you leave to go
[1:05:35] off into captivity God already has a way
[1:05:38] prepared for you to come back again and
[1:05:40] he's already spoken it God already knew
[1:05:43] the exact number of days that they would
[1:05:45] be gone he knew exactly when they would
[1:05:47] come back he knew exactly how he would
[1:05:50] get them back into their Homeland again
[1:05:53] and when we look at this friends we see
[1:05:55] God comforting his people think about it
[1:05:57] now he's comforting his people before
[1:06:00] they ever left before they were ever
[1:06:02] taken in in off into bondage he wanted
[1:06:06] them to know that the way back was
[1:06:08] already made for them to come back that
[1:06:11] there's no way that that this would fail
[1:06:13] and it's a beautiful story because it's
[1:06:16] it's the story of of redemption we find
[1:06:19] this exact same story starting in the
[1:06:21] Garden of Eden and this story ends at
[1:06:24] the closing of the Gentile age which we
[1:06:27] believe we're living in and the children
[1:06:29] of Israel they were carried when they
[1:06:32] left when when the first couple left the
[1:06:36] garden God said I'm going to make a way
[1:06:38] back for you right God had a plan so
[1:06:43] this story ends at the closing of the
[1:06:45] Gentile age which you and I are living
[1:06:48] in now the children of Israel they were
[1:06:50] carried off into Babylon and their
[1:06:52] Temple their place of worship was
[1:06:55] destroyed the place where God had placed
[1:06:57] his name the place where God would meet
[1:06:59] them and we see in the book of Zechariah
[1:07:01] Chapter 4 that God told the the prophet
[1:07:04] he said go tell zerubabel I will restore
[1:07:08] sayeth the Lord not by power not by
[1:07:11] might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord
[1:07:13] so there was nothing that could keep
[1:07:15] this Tabernacle from being
[1:07:17] restored so keep in mind that the
[1:07:20] natural Tabernacle was foreshadowing the
[1:07:23] true Tabernacle that would be not made
[1:07:25] of stone but would be made of Flesh so
[1:07:28] we find in the book of Isaiah that
[1:07:30] before the Tabernacle was even destroyed
[1:07:33] God had already determined the very man
[1:07:35] that he was going to use to restore it
[1:07:37] by and we are told in the Book of Daniel
[1:07:40] uh uh that Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar
[1:07:43] about his dreams and he tells him you
[1:07:45] have a kingdom now but uh the kingdom
[1:07:48] that you have is going to be taken away
[1:07:49] from you it's going to be given to the
[1:07:51] mes and to the Persians and and I Isaiah
[1:07:54] had already spoken of a Persian king by
[1:07:57] the name of Cyrus and this king would
[1:07:59] come and destroy Babylon and would set
[1:08:02] at Liberty the children of God to
[1:08:04] rebuild the Temple and this was hundreds
[1:08:07] of years before the temple had ever been
[1:08:09] taken down or destroyed God already
[1:08:12] prophesied of the rebuilding before it
[1:08:14] was destroyed so God tells them this
[1:08:17] Temple will be torn down but I will
[1:08:20] rebuild again and it won't be by might
[1:08:23] it won't be by Man's power but by my
[1:08:25] spirit so God later sent King Cyrus in
[1:08:29] to destroy Babylon at the appointed time
[1:08:32] and and Cyrus was a secular man he
[1:08:34] wasn't religious he was a secular man
[1:08:37] kind of like Trump he was going to use
[1:08:38] this man for his purpose so God later
[1:08:42] sent Cyrus the king in to destroy
[1:08:44] Babylon so imagine if you will you know
[1:08:47] people a lot of times say well where
[1:08:49] does it say that in the Bible we're
[1:08:50] dramatizing okay we're using a little
[1:08:52] bit of Liber here but just imagine when
[1:08:55] the king rides over the walls of uh that
[1:08:59] the Persian army had just taken down and
[1:09:02] the priest looks out and sees his King
[1:09:05] riding on this on this big horse and
[1:09:08] there's something that looks familiar
[1:09:10] about him so the priest runs off and he
[1:09:13] goes to get the Scrolls and then he
[1:09:15] comes over to this great king and he he
[1:09:17] asks him sir what is your name and he
[1:09:20] says my name is Cyrus and so he opens
[1:09:23] the SC Scrolls and he goes down to the
[1:09:25] scroll with that's the scroll of Isaiah
[1:09:28] and he looks down through there and he
[1:09:30] says oh there you are in this 600y old
[1:09:34] letter it was already written by one of
[1:09:37] the prophets and here you are this day
[1:09:39] this scripture is fulfilled you are the
[1:09:42] very fulfillment of what Isaiah spoke so
[1:09:45] this Gentile king's name was already put
[1:09:48] here because he was to be a Shepherd Of
[1:09:50] God for the sake of the Jewish people
[1:09:53] and as they were trying to rebuild this
[1:09:54] Temple it looked like it was never going
[1:09:56] to uh they had opposition here and
[1:09:59] opposition there and it it looked like
[1:10:00] it was never going to be completed I
[1:10:02] hope you're listening tonight it looks
[1:10:04] like this body of Christ can never be
[1:10:06] completed completed but God has already
[1:10:09] spoke it won't be by might it won't be
[1:10:12] by human power but by my spirit sayeth
[1:10:14] the Lord so these things were already
[1:10:17] known of God and and so that's why
[1:10:20] Jeremiah could be so comfortable with
[1:10:22] the word of the Lord to the people
[1:10:23] people when he declared to them I know
[1:10:26] my thoughts toward you and they are
[1:10:29] thoughts of peace and not of evil and I
[1:10:33] know your final destination I know your
[1:10:36] end so everything that was happening to
[1:10:39] them friends was to bring them to the
[1:10:42] expected end that God had for them is
[1:10:45] that right so I want you to listen
[1:10:47] closer for just a moment the destruction
[1:10:50] of Israel was not for the destruction of
[1:10:53] the seed of God God never destroys his
[1:10:56] own seed it was to destroy the idolatry
[1:11:01] that had slipped its way among the
[1:11:03] children of Israel in the land and God
[1:11:05] knew I can take all of that idolatry out
[1:11:09] I can renew the temple and not lose one
[1:11:12] of my children God never wipes out his
[1:11:15] own seed God did the same thing in the
[1:11:17] Garden of Eden he took his family out of
[1:11:19] the garden then he said I'm going to
[1:11:21] deal with sin I'm going to deal with the
[1:11:23] sin question I'm going to pay the price
[1:11:26] for it and then I'm going to purge and
[1:11:29] then I'm going to bring my family back
[1:11:30] in and I'm not going to lose a single
[1:11:34] one so keep in mind that God had a book
[1:11:36] with names written in it and this book
[1:11:39] was his family photo album if you will
[1:11:42] it was in his thinking and your name of
[1:11:46] course is your characteristics and it's
[1:11:48] what you will manifest here on the earth
[1:11:50] Abraham had his name changed to from
[1:11:52] Abram to Abraham meaning father of many
[1:11:54] nations because that's what he was going
[1:11:57] to do so if if there had not been a fall
[1:12:00] in the Garden of Eden those names would
[1:12:03] have all eventually have come forth by
[1:12:06] the spoken word and and they would have
[1:12:08] lived here upon the Earth but we know
[1:12:11] that there was a fall and yet God had a
[1:12:14] provision to see that all of those names
[1:12:16] would still come forth by a second birth
[1:12:20] and all are coming forth and not one
[1:12:23] should be lost you know imagine this
[1:12:27] imagine when Jesus said father I thank
[1:12:30] you for all that you've given me are
[1:12:33] going to come I won't lose one I can
[1:12:35] imagine the devil you know he was
[1:12:37] following him around and uh manifesting
[1:12:39] himself here and there and trying to
[1:12:40] fuss and uh uh getting some of his
[1:12:42] children to try to uh uh cause some
[1:12:45] aggravation I imagine that he must a his
[1:12:48] heart must erased right about then
[1:12:50] because Jesus said uh I thank you all
[1:12:53] that you've given me they're going to
[1:12:54] come I won't lose one and so he thought
[1:12:57] uh here's what I'm going to do I'm going
[1:12:59] to bury them so far in sin I'm going to
[1:13:02] bury them in adultery I'm going to bury
[1:13:04] them in drugs I'm going to bury them in
[1:13:07] methodism baptism whatever republicanism
[1:13:10] Democrat libertarian I'm going to bury
[1:13:12] him so far that he won't he should have
[1:13:16] never said that he should have never
[1:13:18] made that claim but friends if he had to
[1:13:20] come down he's gone down alleys that you
[1:13:22] and I have went down wherever he has to
[1:13:25] go he knows where his seed is and he
[1:13:28] won't lose a single one no matter how
[1:13:30] far in sin they're
[1:13:32] buried he promised I won't lose a single
[1:13:35] one so God never wipes out his own seed
[1:13:40] but we know that there was a fall and as
[1:13:42] I said God made a provision for those
[1:13:44] names to still come forth by a second
[1:13:47] birth and all of them will come forward
[1:13:49] not one will be lost and there'll be
[1:13:52] others that weren't even in the picture
[1:13:55] that wouldn't even be here had there not
[1:13:57] been a fall and they will be saved
[1:14:00] that's the god that we
[1:14:01] serve Jesus so these these names these
[1:14:05] thoughts they are the very attribute of
[1:14:08] their father they are his eternal
[1:14:10] thoughts and they are predestinated to
[1:14:13] come forth in their season so Adam knew
[1:14:17] think about this Adam Knew by his first
[1:14:19] birth that he was The Offspring of his
[1:14:21] father he knew that God was his father
[1:14:23] that he came from God when we come forth
[1:14:26] by the word of by the spirit for our day
[1:14:30] we cry father father and we recognize by
[1:14:35] the new birth our point of origin we
[1:14:38] recognize that's why you say Aba father
[1:14:41] that word ABA actually means Papa I mean
[1:14:44] that is such a a word of endur it's not
[1:14:46] just Dad it's Papa right you cry ABA
[1:14:51] father because you realize I was in you
[1:14:54] I came from you you're you're my source
[1:14:58] I was in you in the beginning I came out
[1:15:01] from you and when you're finished with
[1:15:03] me you're bringing me
[1:15:05] back you are my point of origin
[1:15:09] Hallelujah until we're born again we are
[1:15:12] Believing on God and we are trying to
[1:15:14] please him we are trying to do his will
[1:15:16] but when we are quickened by his Spirit
[1:15:18] when the word is in US is quickened we
[1:15:21] step into a new kingdom and we are new
[1:15:24] creatures literally new creatures the
[1:15:27] continuation of this new God race we are
[1:15:30] Supernatural natural
[1:15:32] beings we' brother Brown said we've only
[1:15:35] bypassed our
[1:15:52] theophonic beginning and God's not going
[1:15:54] to change his program so if there was an
[1:15:56] interruption it has to that Interruption
[1:15:58] has to be satisfied he was given two
[1:16:00] instructions one was to replenish the
[1:16:03] earth and the other was to take Dominion
[1:16:07] so Eden God built Eden and he placed man
[1:16:12] in Eden and Eden you might think of it
[1:16:14] you know when they when they're
[1:16:15] constructing a a new development they'll
[1:16:18] have what they call Model Homes right
[1:16:21] and so you go in and you look at the
[1:16:22] model hom you say yeah I want one like
[1:16:24] this or want one like that except maybe
[1:16:26] this or that but they're tell they're
[1:16:29] they're going to sell the whole
[1:16:30] development saying that it's going to be
[1:16:33] like this home here or that home there
[1:16:36] right so Eden was the model home
[1:16:38] everything was in order Adam at that
[1:16:41] time was just supposed to keep things in
[1:16:43] order so in the
[1:16:45] restoration God first brings forth the
[1:16:48] names that were written on that book and
[1:16:51] then in the Millennium we take Dominion
[1:16:54] so think of the grace of God tonight
[1:16:56] friends very familiar scripture but from
[1:16:58] Romans
[1:16:59] 8:28 Paul said and we know not we think
[1:17:03] we wonder we know that all things worked
[1:17:06] all things all things are not good but
[1:17:09] all things work together for good to
[1:17:13] them that love God how many loves God of
[1:17:15] course you're here on a cold Saturday
[1:17:17] night you love God all things work
[1:17:20] together for good to them that love God
[1:17:22] to them who are the called according to
[1:17:25] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[1:17:29] pre he did he predestinate to be
[1:17:31] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:17:34] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:17:38] Brethren now friends if he's the
[1:17:40] firstborn that means there's a second
[1:17:41] born a third born there's more that will
[1:17:44] be like him moreover whom he did
[1:17:47] predestinate them he also called whom
[1:17:50] and whom he called them he also just
[1:17:53] Justified notice he's saying this past
[1:17:54] tense in God's mind it's done there's no
[1:17:57] way this isn't going to happen and whom
[1:18:00] he justified them he also glorified
[1:18:02] that's the change of your body it's done
[1:18:05] friends you see God actually fornew his
[1:18:09] sons and daughters that make up his
[1:18:12] bride body before this awful ever this
[1:18:15] awful thing ever happened here on the
[1:18:17] earth before man fell in the garden and
[1:18:20] sin entered into the picture God knew
[1:18:23] he knew how it was he knew the he has an
[1:18:25] expected end before all the troubles
[1:18:28] before all the problems God knew that he
[1:18:31] had a bride and he knew that the
[1:18:34] conditions uh would be such as they are
[1:18:37] today when we came into the world and
[1:18:40] God already before he before we ever
[1:18:43] left his mind as a thought God knew how
[1:18:47] he was going to bring us
[1:18:49] back to the place that he forew that we
[1:18:52] would be in
[1:18:54] now friends we often spend a lot of time
[1:18:57] overthinking this when it's not our idea
[1:19:00] to begin with it's his idea these are
[1:19:03] his thoughts it's our place to say be it
[1:19:06] unto me in fact what's the theme of this
[1:19:09] message only debate only argue only
[1:19:14] believe he's telling us and we say ah
[1:19:17] okay be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:19:21] hallelujah these are his thoughts
[1:19:23] and they're wonderful thoughts aren't
[1:19:24] they they're the best thoughts so the
[1:19:27] problem that we have as human beings in
[1:19:29] our first birth is that we're living in
[1:19:31] a shadow world we we we have very
[1:19:34] limited sight we we uh we have limited
[1:19:38] Vision the the vision that we walk in we
[1:19:41] we can't see down the road we can't see
[1:19:43] well what's the purpose of this and
[1:19:45] what's the purpose of that and is this
[1:19:46] just uh meaningless suffering and so on
[1:19:50] and so forth so before our new birth
[1:19:53] uh Paul said we're dead while we yet
[1:19:55] live we are living in a dreamlike state
[1:19:58] if you will uh anybody here A Dream any
[1:20:02] of you a dream okay have you ever woke
[1:20:05] up from a dream and you wondered well
[1:20:08] why didn't I just do this or that it
[1:20:10] you're struggling in that dream and and
[1:20:13] and and you're trapped and but when you
[1:20:15] wake up it's like duh why didn't I just
[1:20:18] boo back or whatever it was right you
[1:20:21] are a victim in your dreams but when you
[1:20:25] wake up you're no longer a victim so is
[1:20:28] it with the new birth you wake up you
[1:20:31] were dead while you yet lived you wake
[1:20:34] up and you're no longer a victim now
[1:20:37] you're a
[1:20:38] victimizer Satan gave you a hard time
[1:20:41] now you're giving him a hard time you're
[1:20:43] ruining his Eden oh he hates that we see
[1:20:47] all the perversion everything coming but
[1:20:49] he cannot have his Eden as long as
[1:20:51] you're here
[1:20:53] Hallelujah so our natural vision it's so
[1:20:56] limited and it's so shaped by our our
[1:20:58] first birth uh it's shaped then by our
[1:21:01] home life and then it's shaped by the
[1:21:03] circumstances in our childhood and in
[1:21:06] our past and and so we're limited in our
[1:21:09] vision and our vision then is so narrow
[1:21:11] because we can only see the here and now
[1:21:14] and the problems that we're facing at
[1:21:16] the moment well I just prayed for
[1:21:18] healing and uh it's been 5 minutes and I
[1:21:21] didn't get healed and we've been given a
[1:21:23] promise time has nothing to do with it
[1:21:25] but we can only see the here and now
[1:21:27] right so our vision becomes so molded by
[1:21:30] our troubles and by our issues and our
[1:21:33] circumstances and uh experiences in life
[1:21:37] but the scriptures are telling us that
[1:21:40] our lives and I want you to get this
[1:21:42] tonight friends our lives are much
[1:21:45] bigger than our conditions at home then
[1:21:48] our our our our childhood uh uh The Way
[1:21:52] We Were rais raised the the things that
[1:21:54] have befallen us along the way your life
[1:21:56] is so much bigger than that your life
[1:21:59] has a purpose and that purpose has not
[1:22:01] been sidelined you see this picture goes
[1:22:04] all the way back to the mind of God God
[1:22:08] already knew your path for whom he did
[1:22:11] for know he also did predestinate to be
[1:22:14] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:22:17] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:22:19] Brethren Paul goes on a little later and
[1:22:21] he says what so what shall we say he
[1:22:25] said this what shall we say what's our
[1:22:28] response this is what he said now what
[1:22:30] say you if God be for us who can be
[1:22:33] against
[1:22:34] us Lord so that means tonight friends
[1:22:37] there's a people that are predestinated
[1:22:40] to be the very image of the Son of God
[1:22:43] so do we realize the full meaning of
[1:22:45] that today who can stop it God is going
[1:22:48] to have this he will have preeminence in
[1:22:51] a body Hallelujah and and and as far as
[1:22:54] that goes Emanuel you you were born for
[1:22:57] this age you couldn't have been born in
[1:22:59] another age we didn't even know how uh
[1:23:02] uh genetics and everything is worked up
[1:23:05] the pressures that were under today they
[1:23:07] couldn't have taken a few hundred years
[1:23:09] ago you are specially made for this hour
[1:23:13] right you were in Grandpa you were in
[1:23:14] Great Grandpa great great grandpa and
[1:23:17] maybe uh you know am I supposed to come
[1:23:20] out I'm not it was your idea but let's
[1:23:23] just play with that for a moment am I
[1:23:25] supposed to come out no because the word
[1:23:27] for that age wouldn't wake you the word
[1:23:30] for that age wouldn't quck you were made
[1:23:32] for this age and there was a word sent
[1:23:35] for this age you weren't made for any
[1:23:37] other a you were made for this day and
[1:23:40] the word that's coming is for you it's
[1:23:42] to wake you it's to it's to show you who
[1:23:45] you are so there's a people that are
[1:23:49] predestinated to be to uh show
[1:23:53] uh show forth the very image of the Son
[1:23:55] of God he will have preeminence in a
[1:23:56] body three-fold purpose
[1:24:00] so we have we had to be brought forth in
[1:24:04] this last age in this time when the Son
[1:24:07] of God will be alive again in a human
[1:24:09] body in a Min membered body and the
[1:24:12] image of the Son of God will come alive
[1:24:15] again once again in his people and the
[1:24:17] works that he did he'll do it multiplied
[1:24:20] upon multiplied upon multiplied so
[1:24:23] brother Bram says I I believe it was
[1:24:24] Victory Day in uh Sierra Vista he says
[1:24:27] God knew what hour what season what
[1:24:30] bedding ground that you would be planted
[1:24:33] and then he says the message of the hour
[1:24:36] you're the message of the hour and it
[1:24:39] would take a certain light to wake you
[1:24:42] up and to bring you forth in your day
[1:24:46] we're not living in the stop time we're
[1:24:48] not living in the tassel time we're not
[1:24:50] living in the time of the husk or the
[1:24:52] shuck we're here in the seed time when
[1:24:55] the seed has come back to the Earth
[1:24:57] again Jesus said father glorify thy name
[1:25:01] and he said I have glorified my name and
[1:25:03] I will glorify it again so here we are
[1:25:07] friends at the time when the name of the
[1:25:09] Lord is being glorified once again in
[1:25:12] this church you see it's the very same
[1:25:15] life now in another body that life has
[1:25:18] found its power that life has found its
[1:25:21] reality it's found a body that's willing
[1:25:24] to surrender to the powers of Christ and
[1:25:27] it will be made manifest so think about
[1:25:30] where we're at today Jesus said in
[1:25:32] Matthew 16:18 he says Thou Art Peter and
[1:25:37] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:25:39] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:25:41] against it this is the first mention in
[1:25:43] the Bible of the New Testament of a
[1:25:45] church and Jesus said I'm going to build
[1:25:47] this church it's not going to be an
[1:25:50] organization it's not going to be a club
[1:25:53] so what is it then it's something that
[1:25:56] he will
[1:25:57] build what a prophecy he said I will
[1:25:59] build my church and if you look at it uh
[1:26:02] uh in in Matthew 16 and 17 you you can
[1:26:05] see the seven Church ages in fact you
[1:26:07] can see Matthew 17 starts and after six
[1:26:11] days after six days is the seventh day
[1:26:14] he took two of his disciples up on the
[1:26:16] top of the mountain they saw him
[1:26:18] transfigured into his coming day the
[1:26:20] others were down that's it end of the
[1:26:22] church ages at the top of the you
[1:26:24] couldn't see this until you're at the
[1:26:26] top of the mountain the others down
[1:26:28] below they heard lightning and thunder
[1:26:30] those at the top they heard a voice
[1:26:33] somebody say praise the Lord so what a
[1:26:35] prophecy uh that Jesus spoke who's going
[1:26:39] to stop him he has been building this
[1:26:41] church by his Spirit sayeth the Lord the
[1:26:45] word himself is telling us what he's
[1:26:48] going to do over seven ages in fact The
[1:26:51] Seven Ages as I said they are prophesied
[1:26:53] Matthew 16-1 17 and here you and I are
[1:26:56] living in this last age and the prophet
[1:26:58] of God in this age tells us who is the
[1:27:02] Builder this is from the leosan church
[1:27:04] age page 336 he said he calls himself
[1:27:08] the author of the creation of God he
[1:27:11] says this is another creation this has
[1:27:14] to do with the church this is a special
[1:27:17] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:27:21] of the that church the Heavenly
[1:27:23] bridegroom listen to this created his
[1:27:26] own
[1:27:27] bride now friends if he created it how
[1:27:30] can it not come out as he as he desires
[1:27:34] as he Wills he can do whatever he wants
[1:27:37] he's the one that put the stars in place
[1:27:39] he's the one that said let there be
[1:27:41] light the same one that spoke Let There
[1:27:44] Be has spoken his bride into existence
[1:27:48] by his word and to his specifications
[1:27:51] and you and I are living in the time of
[1:27:54] the completion of that work the
[1:27:56] finishing touches to that body what a
[1:28:00] time it is for you and I what an honor
[1:28:02] it is to live in this in this hour in
[1:28:04] this age you say it's horrible it's
[1:28:06] great it's great it's Dreadful it just
[1:28:09] depends on what you look at it's a
[1:28:10] wonderful time it's a horrible time
[1:28:12] don't look at the horrible look at the
[1:28:15] wonderful the Lord he says I will build
[1:28:18] my church and nothing will stop me so no
[1:28:22] wonder the prophet of God said God never
[1:28:24] changes his mind about his word and that
[1:28:28] he has thoughts concerning you and I
[1:28:30] tonight I want it to be personal tonight
[1:28:31] friends if if this isn't personal it's
[1:28:34] just another story it needs to be
[1:28:37] personal so ironically you and I we live
[1:28:40] in an age that looks to be in some ways
[1:28:43] so going back to trying to rebuild that
[1:28:46] Tabernacle it looked like you know 90
[1:28:49] something per of it was done but it
[1:28:51] looked looked like uh zerubabel was
[1:28:55] wondering how's this going to get done
[1:28:57] there was opposition and they're having
[1:28:59] to look behind their backs and it just
[1:29:01] looked like there was so much to be done
[1:29:03] and people weren't cooperating it was
[1:29:05] almost done but it didn't look like it
[1:29:07] was going to get done we look around we
[1:29:10] look at ourselves we don't have to look
[1:29:12] at anybody else we look at ourselves and
[1:29:14] we think you
[1:29:15] know I think I'm still waiting for this
[1:29:18] or that or the other how's God ever
[1:29:20] going to have this church he's going to
[1:29:22] have it he's going to do it and it won't
[1:29:25] be by your ability it'll be by his
[1:29:27] Spirit sayeth the Lord so we're living
[1:29:30] in an age that looks to be so far from
[1:29:33] in some ways from the image of the
[1:29:36] church that Jesus said that he would
[1:29:37] build our age is foreshadowed by the
[1:29:41] Tabernacle in Jerusalem that zerubabel
[1:29:44] was tasked with
[1:29:46] restoring and the Lord said I will
[1:29:48] restore and we we had a an Elijah
[1:29:51] Ministry to restore so we look at the
[1:29:54] description of his church that he said
[1:29:57] he would have he said it will be without
[1:29:58] spot it will be without wrinkle it will
[1:30:01] be without blemish and we might look at
[1:30:03] it and say
[1:30:05] impossible we look at ourselves and we
[1:30:08] say I fall so short of this image
[1:30:12] impossible with man it is impossible so
[1:30:15] that's a good thing that we can see that
[1:30:17] with our human eyes but it won't be by
[1:30:19] man's might it won't be by man power but
[1:30:23] by my spirit sayeth the Lord so this
[1:30:26] Tabernacle friends is being completed
[1:30:29] and it will be completed just to his
[1:30:32] specifications and this Tabernacle is
[1:30:34] being finished and the Lord God
[1:30:37] omnipotent is reigning in a body uh a
[1:30:40] body that's not made with hands but in
[1:30:43] It's A Min membered body of Flesh that's
[1:30:45] here on the earth and she has come to
[1:30:48] maturity she wasn't of marriageable age
[1:30:50] throughout the church ages but she's
[1:30:52] finally come to marriageable age she's
[1:30:54] finally come to the age where she can be
[1:30:57] impregnated she's finally come to the
[1:30:59] age where she can bring Christ back to
[1:31:01] the earth once
[1:31:03] again uh brother Bram said in Israel in
[1:31:05] the church uh part two he says let me
[1:31:08] tell you something brother listen to
[1:31:10] this and I say this with respect
[1:31:12] Hallelujah all hell can't stop it it's
[1:31:15] ordained of Jesus Christ to be so and it
[1:31:18] will be for Upon This Rock I shall build
[1:31:22] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[1:31:24] not Prevail against it how what is it
[1:31:26] what kind of a church flesh and blood
[1:31:28] has not revealed it to you Peter but my
[1:31:30] Father which is in heaven has revealed
[1:31:32] it to you spiritual Revelation by the
[1:31:34] Holy Ghost of the word of God on this
[1:31:37] rock I'll build my church and the Gates
[1:31:40] of Hell shall not or can't Prevail
[1:31:42] against it he says she's moving
[1:31:45] on oh I I'm so thankful for eagle eyes
[1:31:49] in R he's he sees the Vision there it is
[1:31:53] I see it we're getting closer we're
[1:31:55] getting closer he sees it you and I
[1:31:57] we're hearing it we're pursuing after it
[1:32:00] we're walking toward it one day friends
[1:32:02] we're just going to step right into it
[1:32:04] and we'll realize I was what he saw in
[1:32:06] the
[1:32:08] vision this is that in other words
[1:32:11] remember on the day of Pentecost uh the
[1:32:14] brother Brown said Jesus told him go
[1:32:16] Terry on high until you're endued with
[1:32:18] power and and he dramatized it for us
[1:32:21] and he said maybe Monday morning uh
[1:32:23] Philip got up and picked up his
[1:32:24] briefcase or one of the brothers and
[1:32:26] said you know I believe we got it you
[1:32:27] know we we've got a Ministry we've
[1:32:29] already been preaching we've already
[1:32:31] been casting out Devils we got gifts uh
[1:32:36] I I think we got it brother Brown said
[1:32:38] Peter said hey wait hold on wait until
[1:32:42] wait until well Peter how's it going to
[1:32:44] be I don't know all I know is he said
[1:32:47] wait until and when it came then they
[1:32:51] asked the people in the city they asked
[1:32:53] him what's this all about well now he
[1:32:55] could tell you because the manifestation
[1:32:57] is the Revelation it is the
[1:32:59] interpretation Peter said this is that
[1:33:03] you want to know what the prophet Joel
[1:33:05] was talking about we could all discuss
[1:33:07] and this and that but I'm here to tell
[1:33:09] you this is that that was spoken of of
[1:33:11] the prophet of Joel friends there's a
[1:33:13] people on the face of the Earth tonight
[1:33:15] I believe that are going to be able to
[1:33:16] say this is that this is what God
[1:33:19] promised this is a church that's stored
[1:33:22] this is a church and and there's a
[1:33:24] people that'll say when the body change
[1:33:27] comes how's it going to happen this is
[1:33:30] that amen somebody say praise the Lord
[1:33:34] so there's a bride that's moving on
[1:33:36] tonight friends and she cannot be
[1:33:38] stopped she can't be stopped because
[1:33:41] she's not moving by her own power she's
[1:33:43] not moving by the power of a bishop or
[1:33:45] by an organization or by a Creed but
[1:33:48] she's moving by the power of God as he
[1:33:51] is performing his good word concerning
[1:33:53] her and she cannot be stopped because
[1:33:56] he's in control how many believes that I
[1:34:00] think about David uh uh I'm conscious of
[1:34:03] time I don't want to take too much more
[1:34:05] time but I think about David who one day
[1:34:07] stood on a hill and he looked down at
[1:34:09] the Philistines that were in the that
[1:34:11] were garrisoned about in the valley
[1:34:13] below uh they they were gathered
[1:34:16] together there was a great Army down
[1:34:18] there and David did not immediately run
[1:34:21] down and jump into the battle but
[1:34:24] instead he sought the Lord for
[1:34:27] leadership he knew that the battle was
[1:34:30] the Lord's and so he inquired of God and
[1:34:34] God told him just hold your peace for
[1:34:36] now now imagine how popular David was
[1:34:39] right about then the Lord says but when
[1:34:42] you see the wind in the bushes behind
[1:34:45] you then know this is the time for the
[1:34:48] battle so think of this now friends
[1:34:51] David had his own thoughts concerning
[1:34:53] the battle first well this is how we're
[1:34:55] going to do it and that's how we're
[1:34:56] going to do it and and we'll get these
[1:34:58] over here and that over there and we'll
[1:34:59] use this weapon he had to lay all that
[1:35:01] down and then he had great generals and
[1:35:04] great men that were trained in war that
[1:35:06] they had thoughts on the situation and
[1:35:09] they're all putting pressure on them oh
[1:35:11] brother bam we need to go over here no
[1:35:14] the Lord told me this no we need to do
[1:35:16] this so David does something that's
[1:35:18] that's that is truly amazing if you
[1:35:21] justop and think about it for a moment
[1:35:22] he turned his back on his problems he's
[1:35:26] faced with this great Army he's faced
[1:35:28] with all this trouble and he's got all
[1:35:30] these people trying to tell him what to
[1:35:31] do he turns his back on his
[1:35:34] circumstances oh friends I think we need
[1:35:36] to do that he turned his back on his
[1:35:38] problems and instead he looked for the
[1:35:41] moving of the wind somewhere in front of
[1:35:44] him and he's not looking on the
[1:35:46] circumstances now but he's looking for
[1:35:48] the wind because he knows when the wind
[1:35:51] blows in the bushes the angel of God
[1:35:54] will be in that wind so he's not looking
[1:35:57] to the problem but he's looking to the
[1:35:59] problem solver and he's waiting on God
[1:36:02] knowing that he'll be right on time so
[1:36:05] imagine the army that was with him that
[1:36:07] was uh uh they were discussing in uh uh
[1:36:09] the situation and said David we won't
[1:36:12] have another chance like this and we
[1:36:13] need to do it now and he's hold on God
[1:36:16] said God said well we don't see nothing
[1:36:17] am but God said well it's foolish to
[1:36:21] turn your back on it God
[1:36:24] said you need to look at that cancer
[1:36:26] it's real scary but God said but God
[1:36:29] said so I want you to know tonight
[1:36:31] friends that David wasn't looking to the
[1:36:33] enemy for his time piece but he was
[1:36:36] looking to the move of God so I want you
[1:36:39] to know tonight also that the bride is
[1:36:41] not looking at her enemy today either
[1:36:44] but she's looking to the move of God and
[1:36:47] she can be assured that the angel of God
[1:36:50] is in the camp
[1:36:51] besides the darkness that's all around
[1:36:53] us friends besides the trouble that's on
[1:36:56] every side we have a spiritual
[1:36:58] Revelation that we can stand on tonight
[1:37:00] and it is a rock and it's unmovable and
[1:37:02] it's unshakable everything else is
[1:37:05] falling everything else is without a
[1:37:07] bottom it's falling falling falling but
[1:37:10] you're standing on a sure word of
[1:37:11] Prophecy we're not looking at the things
[1:37:14] from the ground but we are looking we
[1:37:16] have been given an eagle anointing and
[1:37:19] the eye of an eagle to Lift us up at
[1:37:22] placees in a cliff of a rock places upon
[1:37:25] a rock we have a secret place that's
[1:37:28] been set aside for us that he's hidden
[1:37:30] Us in that no devil can Prevail against
[1:37:33] the world is sifting Sands all around us
[1:37:36] but this bride is not moved with the
[1:37:38] world the prophet said there's a faith
[1:37:41] that moves the bride and he said this is
[1:37:44] the very Faith Of God that move so it's
[1:37:46] not even you working up a faith it's the
[1:37:48] faith of God working in you and through
[1:37:50] you so there's a bride tonight friends
[1:37:53] that's turned her back to the world and
[1:37:56] she's looking to the mulberry bush once
[1:37:58] again and we are waiting for God to
[1:38:00] orchestrate the battle and we've seen
[1:38:03] the wind in the molder berry bush and we
[1:38:05] are entering into the battle and if
[1:38:07] there was an ever a time for us to fight
[1:38:10] against our enemy it's now because in
[1:38:13] this hour we can't lose there's never
[1:38:15] been an age like this there's never been
[1:38:18] a time for you to chase a spirit in your
[1:38:20] life uh
[1:38:22] now is the time we've seen the angel
[1:38:25] moving in the mulberry bush and it's
[1:38:28] time for us to stand it's time for us to
[1:38:31] face down our enemy and run them out of
[1:38:33] our Valley it's in the valley that we
[1:38:35] that we have our problems right we need
[1:38:38] to run them out of our Valley chase the
[1:38:40] Demons of depression chase the those
[1:38:42] hand me- downs from the first tree the
[1:38:45] presence of God is now with the church
[1:38:49] and the presence of God is back in her
[1:38:52] and he will finish what he said he would
[1:38:54] do so there was a time for the heroes of
[1:38:57] the faith in the Old Testament to fight
[1:38:59] and they fought there was a time for
[1:39:01] Joshua to fight and he fought there was
[1:39:03] a time for Moses and he fought now
[1:39:05] there's a time for you and I to fight
[1:39:08] now is that time the wind is blowing in
[1:39:11] the bushes when God took his Prophet off
[1:39:14] the scene God didn't leave how could he
[1:39:17] Unite with a bride body if he's not here
[1:39:20] how could he oh friends how could he
[1:39:23] have preeminence in a body if he isn't
[1:39:25] here he has so much confidence in his
[1:39:27] word he says I'm going to take a bunch
[1:39:29] of Sinners I'm going to take a a
[1:39:33] Kentucky guy that would have been a
[1:39:35] murderer he would have been a drunk he
[1:39:36] would have done this he would have done
[1:39:37] that I saved him I Sanctified him I
[1:39:40] filled him with my spirit I'm going to
[1:39:42] take these I had a perfect garden with a
[1:39:46] a perfect people with a perfect word and
[1:39:48] Satan got in there and caused them to
[1:39:50] fall in a perfect Eden now I'm going to
[1:39:53] go into Satan's Eden here at the end in
[1:39:55] a corrupt world with with corrupt people
[1:39:59] fallen people that were born in sin and
[1:40:01] I'm going to show him the power of this
[1:40:03] Blood I'm going to show him full
[1:40:07] complete Redemption because I'm going to
[1:40:09] take them and I'm going to justify him
[1:40:11] I'm going to sanctify him take the
[1:40:13] cigarettes out the alcohol I'm going to
[1:40:15] fill them with the Holy Ghost and then
[1:40:17] I'm going to use them and they're going
[1:40:19] to walk right down the middle this
[1:40:21] horrid Satan's Eden and say I have no
[1:40:24] part in you and you have no part in me
[1:40:27] and is happening right now as we speak
[1:40:30] Hallelujah Isaiah 55:8 says for my
[1:40:33] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[1:40:36] are my ways your ways or neither are
[1:40:38] your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as
[1:40:41] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[1:40:43] are my ways higher than your ways and my
[1:40:45] thoughts than your thoughts now friends
[1:40:48] God's not putting us down when he makes
[1:40:49] this statement it's just the truth truth
[1:40:51] and I want you to I just want to get
[1:40:53] this across before we close tonight he
[1:40:55] wants you to know that there are ways
[1:40:58] that are higher than your natural
[1:41:00] thinking and that's why we get
[1:41:02] discouraged is because of our natural
[1:41:04] thinking when the elect seed of God see
[1:41:07] his thoughts on the matter that is what
[1:41:10] will take the bride into a higher realm
[1:41:13] of thinking and you can't live any
[1:41:15] higher than you think as a man thinketh
[1:41:19] in his heart so is he right so we are
[1:41:22] now in the mind portion of the body is
[1:41:25] that true we're we're not in the lips
[1:41:27] we're not in the nose or not even in the
[1:41:30] eyes we're in the mind part that's why
[1:41:31] it's not a public show you can't see a
[1:41:34] physical something out there with the
[1:41:37] body but it's we're in that mind stage
[1:41:40] right uh that mind portion so we we can
[1:41:45] see not just a chronology in this hour
[1:41:48] of what God did but we now now see what
[1:41:52] he was thinking when he did it Moses
[1:41:55] said God did this God did that God did
[1:41:57] this we had a Prophet come in our day
[1:41:58] and say this is why he did it this is
[1:42:00] what he was thinking this was what was
[1:42:02] in his mind so Satan fears the thought
[1:42:07] of you recognizing who you really are
[1:42:10] and that's where we're trying to get
[1:42:12] this weekend uh uh trying to help you I
[1:42:14] I know you know these things just want
[1:42:16] to encourage you Satan's there to
[1:42:17] discourage us every every moment of the
[1:42:19] day just want to encourage you by the
[1:42:21] word of the Lord he constantly bombards
[1:42:24] us with thoughts concerning our first
[1:42:26] birth and friends if all I looked at was
[1:42:29] my first birth I'd quit there's no
[1:42:31] purpose right but we are dead to that
[1:42:34] first birth forget about the first birth
[1:42:38] quit identifying with it I can't prove
[1:42:41] to anybody tonight that in my Third
[1:42:44] Realm there's a gene that came from God
[1:42:47] but by Revelation I declare tonight that
[1:42:49] there is amen and stick around you'll
[1:42:52] see it listen friends the devil cannot
[1:42:55] change God's mind about you God's
[1:42:57] already made up his mind God has already
[1:43:00] sealed in the thought in his mind
[1:43:03] concerning the real
[1:43:05] you so I want you to see tonight that
[1:43:08] there is a higher thought concerning you
[1:43:12] so think about it this in itself is a
[1:43:14] tremendous thought you see if there was
[1:43:17] no higher thought concerning you then
[1:43:20] you would have to stay the way you
[1:43:22] are right so look at the look at the
[1:43:27] places that our thoughts have taken us
[1:43:29] in the past I want you to know tonight
[1:43:32] friends that the word has never placed
[1:43:34] you in depression the word has never
[1:43:38] spoken evil of you God never cursed Adam
[1:43:42] Adam was his son he cursed the ground
[1:43:44] for his sake your human thoughts declare
[1:43:47] I can't live it your human thoughts
[1:43:50] declare I can't overcome this thing but
[1:43:53] God never told you
[1:43:54] that that is not his thought you know I
[1:43:59] apologize for this little crude analogy
[1:44:01] but it just sometimes a picture is a
[1:44:03] thousand words you know there was a
[1:44:06] there was a a time back in the 70s and
[1:44:09] the 80s with this kind of smart eliy
[1:44:11] thing where if if somebody's talking to
[1:44:14] you and you decide you don't want to
[1:44:15] talk to him anymore you put up your hand
[1:44:18] and you say talk to the hand cuz the
[1:44:20] face doesn't want to talk to you right
[1:44:22] well we we we don't want to be smart
[1:44:24] eliy that way but what we do want to do
[1:44:27] is apply that in a spiritual realm we
[1:44:29] need to tell the devil talk to the word
[1:44:32] cu the face don't want to talk to you
[1:44:34] you can throw all you want at me but
[1:44:36] your battle is with the word talk to the
[1:44:39] word you say this and that but here's
[1:44:42] what the word says you know so much of
[1:44:44] the time we what we need to do is just
[1:44:46] stop the devil tells us this the devil
[1:44:48] tells us you're no good okay devil what
[1:44:52] what uh uh uh what book was that in what
[1:44:55] verse where did God say I'm no good
[1:44:58] where did God say I'm a failure where
[1:44:59] did God say I'll never make it that's
[1:45:02] your word God says something else in
[1:45:06] fact I want to tell you devil hell
[1:45:09] wasn't created for me you you're trying
[1:45:11] to convince me I'm going to hell hell
[1:45:12] wasn't created for me it was created for
[1:45:14] you and your
[1:45:15] angels talk to the
[1:45:18] word cuz the face don't want to talk
[1:45:21] yeah
[1:45:23] Hallelujah so you're a human thoughts
[1:45:25] declare I can't make it I'll never be
[1:45:27] this I can't do that but God never told
[1:45:30] you that that is not his thought
[1:45:33] concerning
[1:45:35] you whose thought is it then why do we
[1:45:39] want to dwell on negative thoughts we
[1:45:40] started by opening the scripture with
[1:45:43] whatsoever things are good whatsoever
[1:45:45] things are positive of good report think
[1:45:47] on these things right we are the ones
[1:45:51] excuse me we are the ones that declares
[1:45:54] it's too hard and we do that based on
[1:45:57] Satan's suggestions to us but friends
[1:46:00] your God is so much bigger than any
[1:46:04] circumstance in your life Satan is not
[1:46:07] in control he has not ruined God's plan
[1:46:10] Satan actually needs permission to do
[1:46:13] things to you right right he came to he
[1:46:17] came to God and you know perhaps he
[1:46:21] comes to God and says God I want to do
[1:46:23] this to uh Emanuel and God looks at it
[1:46:27] and says uh no he's not ready for it
[1:46:29] let's just put it over here on the side
[1:46:31] and then he says okay God how about this
[1:46:34] God looks at it he turns over he looks
[1:46:36] at Michael and grins a little bit
[1:46:39] knowing that Satan's going to get his
[1:46:41] wings singed yeah go ahead go ahead
[1:46:44] Satan's nothing but a tool friends we
[1:46:46] know that we're no match for him in the
[1:46:48] flesh but he's no match for for our
[1:46:50] father hallu he's a tool in God's hand
[1:46:53] to bring you to your expected end he
[1:46:56] needs permission Lord so this is the
[1:46:59] most wicked age that there ever was the
[1:47:02] most deceitful age I used to think that
[1:47:04] that just had to do with uh uh religion
[1:47:06] and it is deceitful but it's deceitful
[1:47:08] everywhere you look right people say who
[1:47:10] are you going to believe you know well
[1:47:13] believe science until we manufacture it
[1:47:16] for you know for our own political
[1:47:19] reasons you can't believe anything but
[1:47:22] you can believe
[1:47:23] God Jesus said I'll be with you I'll be
[1:47:27] in you even to the end of the world he's
[1:47:30] already come so who's going to stop him
[1:47:33] who's going to prevent him from
[1:47:35] finishing this
[1:47:37] Tabernacle sometimes our own thinking
[1:47:39] puts us in places that we can't get out
[1:47:41] of it puts us in a box if you will I I I
[1:47:46] was a u electrical engineer and I worked
[1:47:48] in a certain Niche Community within uh
[1:47:53] electrical engineering I I worked in RF
[1:47:55] engineering high frequency radio waves
[1:47:58] and it's really a faith-based uh thing
[1:48:01] to work in because you can't see a radio
[1:48:04] wave you can't well you I hope you don't
[1:48:05] feel it the power isn't too strong
[1:48:08] you'll never feel it you can't smell it
[1:48:10] you can't contact it with your five
[1:48:11] senses right yet you know that there are
[1:48:14] laws that govern how a radio wave will
[1:48:17] transmit and that you can build
[1:48:19] something if you build it just right uh
[1:48:21] and you obey the laws of physics you'll
[1:48:23] be able to receive that signal bring it
[1:48:25] down from the Heavenly down to an
[1:48:27] Earthly frequency and you'll be able to
[1:48:30] hear it right and you have confidence in
[1:48:32] that so when you build some equipment
[1:48:35] and it doesn't work you don't say well I
[1:48:37] guess you know the theory was wrong I
[1:48:40] guess it doesn't work no you go and find
[1:48:42] out what you did wrong and it's no
[1:48:44] different than our faith walk we have no
[1:48:47] our senses uh our senses can't convince
[1:48:51] us our senses can't uh uh relate to
[1:48:54] what's going on in that other realm but
[1:48:56] we know that there are laws that govern
[1:48:59] it and if we work according to God's
[1:49:01] word we should expect results so if I
[1:49:04] pray for healing and I don't and uh uh I
[1:49:07] get worse or something else happen and
[1:49:10] I'm starting to doubt well the problem
[1:49:12] isn't God's word don't give up on the
[1:49:15] laws those laws don't care who you are
[1:49:16] those are God's laws they'll work so we
[1:49:20] throw out the theory we say which law am
[1:49:23] I breaking well I'm not supposed to
[1:49:25] doubt okay I'll quit doubting I'm not
[1:49:27] supposed to dig up that seed and see if
[1:49:29] something's growing every five minutes
[1:49:31] leave it in the ground commit it amen
[1:49:34] somebody say praise the
[1:49:36] Lord so sometimes our own thinking puts
[1:49:41] us in places that we can't get out of it
[1:49:44] puts us in a box if you
[1:49:46] will situations in our lives situations
[1:49:50] in our past put us in a box and unless
[1:49:54] something breaks that we'll always be in
[1:49:57] that box so if you ever heard the term
[1:50:00] think outside of the box so I told you
[1:50:03] about what I did for a living only to
[1:50:06] bring this in I I managed large teams I
[1:50:09] put them in a
[1:50:11] multi-discipline teams and put the
[1:50:13] vision before him and got everybody to
[1:50:16] contribute and March towards that we
[1:50:18] would start uh we were doing Leading
[1:50:21] Edge technology everything was uh uh
[1:50:24] were uh coming up with new science all
[1:50:27] the time we actually the work that we
[1:50:30] did in the in the 90s is why we have
[1:50:32] cell phones today because we had to
[1:50:34] miniaturize parts we had to move them up
[1:50:36] in frequency and the commercial sector
[1:50:38] got to benefit from it we'd spend a lot
[1:50:40] of money developing that but we would
[1:50:42] come into every every project that we
[1:50:46] would start somebody would say well
[1:50:48] let's think outside of the box right uh
[1:50:51] and what that means is let's take away
[1:50:55] the you
[1:50:57] know
[1:50:59] if forget about all the reasons why you
[1:51:02] can't do something just let come up with
[1:51:05] new ideas don't shoot him down we called
[1:51:07] that you know it's still a baby in the
[1:51:09] cradle and you're killing it before it
[1:51:10] has a chance to grow let that idea out
[1:51:13] there and and let's entertain it instead
[1:51:16] of saying we can't do it let's look at
[1:51:18] it right anyway so we would say let's
[1:51:20] think outside of the box but if you
[1:51:22] think about it it's kind of ludicrous
[1:51:25] because you're in the box so how are you
[1:51:27] going to think outside the box when
[1:51:29] you're in the box right nevertheless we
[1:51:32] humed ourselves yeah we're thinking
[1:51:33] outside of the box yeah right in the
[1:51:36] back of your mind well that'll never
[1:51:37] work and that everybody's biting well we
[1:51:40] were told not to criticize it but
[1:51:42] that'll never
[1:51:44] work but so to truly now catch this
[1:51:48] tonight to truly think outside of the
[1:51:51] box requires that you get out of the
[1:51:55] box and I'm so glad that the baptism of
[1:51:58] the Holy Spirit can get me out of the
[1:52:01] box the baptism of the Holy Spirit can
[1:52:04] uh my heart can be searched my mind can
[1:52:06] be cleansed my conscience my
[1:52:09] subconscious by the washing of the water
[1:52:11] of the word friends on the outside if I
[1:52:14] if if you got something on your face you
[1:52:16] got a loved one they'll say hey hold on
[1:52:18] you know I don't know how your mom was
[1:52:20] but my mom would you know we get these
[1:52:22] little spit basss you know we're driving
[1:52:24] around the car and my mom would say hold
[1:52:27] on and you're like you know you're
[1:52:30] you're going every direction she's like
[1:52:31] hold on you got a little something on
[1:52:33] your face let me get that off right and
[1:52:36] you're trusting her somebody's going to
[1:52:38] tell you you got egg on your face or
[1:52:40] this or that and and if they don't you
[1:52:42] can go look in the mirror so you're
[1:52:44] pretty confident that you can make sure
[1:52:46] that if there's a problem on the outside
[1:52:48] you can take care of it right
[1:52:50] but what about on the inside we don't
[1:52:52] even know what we don't even know we're
[1:52:55] doubting we don't even know what our
[1:52:57] problems we don't have a prophet to come
[1:52:59] and say now you know a dog you got
[1:53:02] chased by a dog and that's why you're
[1:53:03] afraid of this or that and he's dealing
[1:53:05] with that we don't we can't do that I
[1:53:07] don't even know what to clean right but
[1:53:10] he does that word searches the thoughts
[1:53:15] and intents of the heart he knows where
[1:53:17] you'll come into service you'll think
[1:53:19] man it's when night and I barely made it
[1:53:21] I was thinking about not even going and
[1:53:23] uh but something just compelled me to
[1:53:25] come I probably won't get much out of it
[1:53:27] and got a big day tomorrow and I had all
[1:53:29] these problems today but then the
[1:53:31] preacher starts preaching the word and
[1:53:33] before long something gets to working on
[1:53:35] you that water you're being Washed by
[1:53:37] the Water of the the the preacher
[1:53:39] doesn't know right God knows and he
[1:53:43] brings that word it searches the
[1:53:45] thoughts and in it washes you by the
[1:53:47] water of the word somebody say praise
[1:53:50] the Lord praise the Lord so I don't have
[1:53:53] to be bound in other words by the
[1:53:55] constraints of my old thoughts so I want
[1:53:58] to finish up here tonight by looking at
[1:54:00] job for just a moment can I do that so
[1:54:03] job the story of job job is the oldest
[1:54:06] book in the Bible it's not the first one
[1:54:07] that was uh uh uh uh it's the oldest
[1:54:11] right so job actually represents man's
[1:54:16] original position man's fall
[1:54:20] and man's restoration he's the story of
[1:54:23] mankind right he started out with
[1:54:25] everything he lost everything and God
[1:54:28] restored right so I can't think of
[1:54:31] anybody friends I I'm not being
[1:54:35] uh don't don't think I'm being harsh
[1:54:38] tonight I understand we have real
[1:54:40] problems and I understand when we're
[1:54:41] going through it it's very real to us
[1:54:43] but I don't think there's anybody here
[1:54:45] tonight that had it as bad as
[1:54:48] job right okay so job had all these
[1:54:53] counselors and every one of them tried
[1:54:56] to tell him uh they tried to tie his
[1:54:59] circumstances of his life to secret sins
[1:55:02] well the reason this has happened to you
[1:55:03] because you did something and you just
[1:55:04] haven't confessed it right but watch
[1:55:07] what happens when job comes to the
[1:55:10] lowest place in his life he's sitting on
[1:55:13] an ash Heap have you ever wondered about
[1:55:15] that he's sitting on an ash Heap he's
[1:55:17] scraping his sores his wife has told him
[1:55:20] why don't you just renounce God why
[1:55:21] don't you curse God and then die uh so
[1:55:24] he's in the lowest Valley of his entire
[1:55:27] life everything has been taken from him
[1:55:30] even his health even his family even his
[1:55:33] character even his uh
[1:55:35] reputation we might think that we've
[1:55:37] been in low spots and we have but I
[1:55:40] don't think anybody of us tonight has
[1:55:43] been as low as lot was or excuse me as
[1:55:46] job was but notice he's sitting there
[1:55:51] but he's not a secret sinner he's
[1:55:54] sitting on an ash Heep and that Ash Heep
[1:55:57] is the remains of a burnt offering right
[1:56:00] that's all he has and so he's not going
[1:56:04] to move from it because that's all he
[1:56:05] has he has accepted God's sacrifice
[1:56:09] there's the evidence he's presented he's
[1:56:12] identified himself with it personally he
[1:56:15] doesn't understand why this is happening
[1:56:17] that's happening he can't see the future
[1:56:20] all he knows is he's met God's
[1:56:22] requirement so the ashes are all that he
[1:56:26] has left that identifies that he has met
[1:56:28] God's requirement and so he's looking at
[1:56:31] the ashes he's looking at his sacrifice
[1:56:34] rather than his transgressions and he
[1:56:36] has confidence that that sacrifice has
[1:56:40] met God's requirement but now he's got
[1:56:43] to go beyond think about it beyond the
[1:56:46] foundation as Paul said of repentance
[1:56:48] and doctrines and now he needs to go on
[1:56:50] into Perfection so he's sitting at the
[1:56:52] foot of the cross if you will uh but he
[1:56:55] needs to progress in his walk with god
[1:56:58] he has met the requirements of God he's
[1:57:00] sitting on the evidence that he's met
[1:57:02] that re that and that's all he knows
[1:57:04] that's all he has and like us after we
[1:57:08] first get saved he has no idea why he's
[1:57:11] going through what he's going through
[1:57:13] but it is not sin and he is not moving
[1:57:17] he's sitting there Satan will say this
[1:57:19] Satan will say that he's not going to
[1:57:21] move he's staying there at the foot of
[1:57:22] the cross he's claiming his salvation
[1:57:25] and his faith tells him I have met God's
[1:57:28] requirement they say it's a secret sin I
[1:57:30] know everything is under the blood I've
[1:57:34] I've done what God Said I trust right
[1:57:38] but I don't understand the circumstances
[1:57:41] in my life but I know that I have
[1:57:44] repented and I know that I have Pro I
[1:57:47] have provided the required sacrifice in
[1:57:49] your and my case we put our hands on our
[1:57:52] we've identified oursel with our
[1:57:55] sacrifice so he says I'm not sure why
[1:57:58] I'm going through all that I'm going
[1:58:00] through but I'm not moving because this
[1:58:02] is one thing that I know I'm staying
[1:58:04] right there brother Bram said if you
[1:58:06] think that God is putting putting
[1:58:09] something on you then the devil has a
[1:58:11] right to stay right there but if you can
[1:58:13] see that it's the devil you have a right
[1:58:15] to push back so if you think it's God
[1:58:18] then you'll say back and say well must
[1:58:20] Jesus bear the cross alone or he just
[1:58:23] wants me to go through this for his
[1:58:25] glory job is sitting there and a
[1:58:29] whirlwind comes down now think about
[1:58:31] that for a moment friends God was veiled
[1:58:33] in a whirlwind when job couldn't go up
[1:58:36] where God was God came down to where job
[1:58:40] was when man couldn't go up to where God
[1:58:42] was God came down to man I don't know
[1:58:45] where you were at tonight friends but I
[1:58:47] do know that God had to come down into
[1:58:49] the Blackness of my life God had to take
[1:58:52] away my own ideas God had to get me away
[1:58:55] from my own thinking and he had to reach
[1:58:57] way down into my life and God parted the
[1:59:01] veil and spoke to job right where he was
[1:59:05] sitting notice this he says job stand
[1:59:10] up it's time for you to grow up it's
[1:59:13] time for you to move Beyond doctrines of
[1:59:15] baptism and this and that it's time for
[1:59:17] you to go beyond Calvary don't take that
[1:59:20] the wrong way Calvary is necessary but
[1:59:22] it's not the purpose Calvary is
[1:59:25] something God did for something else
[1:59:27] that he had in mind now it's time for
[1:59:29] you to stand up now it's time for you to

[2:01:59] mind of God to come down into the valley
[2:02:02] to raise job up into the mind of God job

[2:03:10] him why he was where he was now now
[2:03:14] friends until you understand why God
[2:03:16] originally made you you'll not be able
[2:03:19] to understand why you're going through

[2:03:22] not meaningless little things these are
[2:03:24] not just you know yeah I just want to
[2:03:26] see him suffer there's a purpose to

[2:03:56] God you aren't just anybody you are a
[2:03:59] child of God right not by your own doing
[2:04:02] by his and God is trying to get you to
[2:04:05] see where you came
[2:04:07] from the revelation of God as your
[2:04:10] savior eliminates Sin from your life you
[2:04:13] say I still make mistakes sin is
[2:04:15] unbelief you're no longer doubting in
[2:04:17] your in your soul you believe God's word
[2:04:20] right the sin question is settled I want
[2:04:23] somebody to say that tonight the sin
[2:04:25] question is settled not just in and out
[2:04:28] and on and off and up and down it's
[2:04:29] settled it's done it's that perfect
[2:04:33] blood was the perfect intercession paid
[2:04:36] the price so what we need to do tonight
[2:04:39] is go beyond the ash Heep we we still
[2:04:43] profess the ash but we need to go beyond
[2:04:45] it with our what our slain sacrifice
[2:04:49] provided for us and we need to stand up
[2:04:52] and we need to come up to the end of the
[2:04:54] ages grow up into the head and then we
[2:04:58] need to let him show us the thoughts in
[2:05:01] the back part of his mind which is what
[2:05:03] he's doing in this hour job's problem
[2:05:05] was thoughts our problem is thoughts we
[2:05:09] can't think higher thoughts than what we
[2:05:11] have so God says when brother Ram said
[2:05:14] when God when he when brother Ram was
[2:05:16] lifted up into that constellation of
[2:05:18] angels how many believe that happen
[2:05:20] people say oh well you know that was
[2:05:21] there after brother Ram was there I
[2:05:23] don't care oh was the cloud there before
[2:05:27] he was there I I still don't care all I
[2:05:29] know is that when he was there there was
[2:05:31] a cloud of angels and they came faster
[2:05:34] than a blink of an eye and he was lifted
[2:05:36] up in it right let me ask you this was
[2:05:39] that bush that that Moses saw was it
[2:05:42] burning before he got there who cares
[2:05:45] was it burning a week later I still
[2:05:48] don't care
[2:05:49] all I know is that when he was there it
[2:05:51] was burning and he went to it and a
[2:05:53] voice spoke to him and then told him
[2:05:56] what to do and what he said would happen
[2:06:00] happened that's all I care about well
[2:06:03] how do I know that happened CU Moses
[2:06:05] said so oh we can't take one man's word
[2:06:08] for it well then just throw out the Book
[2:06:09] of Genesis then maybe it was Adam and
[2:06:12] Steve after all Moses said it was Adam
[2:06:15] and Eve we only have one man's word for
[2:06:17] it that's right
[2:06:19] right and we're taking him out his word
[2:06:20] because it's God's
[2:06:22] word
[2:06:24] hallelujah brother Ram said when he was
[2:06:26] caught up he said I wasn't thinking my
[2:06:28] own thoughts I hope somebody's listening
[2:06:30] tonight when that book comes open to you
[2:06:33] it's his thoughts that are coming you
[2:06:35] don't know where they're coming from we
[2:06:36] were fellowshipping with your precious
[2:06:38] Pastor earlier today and just talking
[2:06:39] about how you stare at something and
[2:06:41] stare at something and you know it fits
[2:06:43] but you don't know how it place and so
[2:06:45] you just leave it alone and then one day
[2:06:46] there's that piece and it drops in
[2:06:48] you're like wow I never would have I
[2:06:51] that thought wasn't my thought but it
[2:06:53] just dropped right in
[2:06:54] there
[2:06:56] Hallelujah
[2:06:58] so job wasn't getting skim milk god
[2:07:02] talked to him now as a mature man he was
[2:07:06] being brought to a place where he could
[2:07:07] stand again I I'm just sorry I'm going
[2:07:10] to take a little intermission here for
[2:07:12] just a moment because we just spoke on
[2:07:14] this on last Wednesday night when God
[2:07:17] said no notice this God said to Satan
[2:07:21] have you considered my servant job well
[2:07:24] thanks a lot God I was doing just F why
[2:07:27] why are you God said to
[2:07:30] Satan God said to Satan have you
[2:07:34] considered my bride I mean my servant
[2:07:36] job right yeah God said that he did say
[2:07:41] the same thing about you today have you
[2:07:43] considered my
[2:07:44] bride and and what did Satan say well
[2:07:47] yeah
[2:07:50] he's
[2:07:50] spoiled he's got everything now I want
[2:07:54] you to think about I I didn't catch this
[2:07:55] until I was preaching it on Wednesday
[2:07:57] night and it just it just dropped in
[2:07:59] there in a way I never saw it before God
[2:08:02] said he's perfect in all his ways
[2:08:04] there's no one like him what proof did
[2:08:07] we have of that he had never faced a
[2:08:10] trial he had
[2:08:12] everything
[2:08:14] right he'd never been through anything
[2:08:17] how could God say that about him I'll
[2:08:20] tell you how he wasn't talking about the
[2:08:22] guy that was there right now he was
[2:08:24] talking about the guy that would
[2:08:26] appear at the end of all the testing and
[2:08:30] trying and God would prove that that's
[2:08:32] who he was job didn't know that's who he
[2:08:35] was he had to go through those things to
[2:08:39] prove that faith has to be proved faith
[2:08:42] has to be tested it will demonstrate it
[2:08:44] will manifest so job is if job was
[2:08:47] proving that conversation he's like what
[2:08:49] what are you even talking about perfect
[2:08:51] in all my ways this and that he it's
[2:08:55] it's pressure that brings out character
[2:08:57] he didn't have the character in the
[2:08:59] beginning not not that he was a bad guy
[2:09:03] but it's it's trials that bring
[2:09:06] character out so God was declaring his
[2:09:10] instate right at the beginning and he
[2:09:12] says go ahead the Lord and and and Satan
[2:09:16] said I'll make him curs you to your face
[2:09:19] he says go ahead and try but I'm going
[2:09:21] to put bounds you can't just do whatever
[2:09:23] you want don't touch that life notice
[2:09:27] he's put a seal on you in this hour go
[2:09:29] ahead put her put this sister through
[2:09:31] this or that don't touch that life I've
[2:09:33] sealed it I've sealed you out I've
[2:09:36] sealed that in her come on Friends
[2:09:39] blessed be the name of the Lord in the
[2:09:42] end job knew what God Said was true he
[2:09:45] didn't know in the beginning but Satan
[2:09:49] and job knew in the end so with that in
[2:09:52] mind job was being brought to a place
[2:09:55] where he could stand again when the
[2:09:57] Revelation broke on him notice this
[2:10:00] brother Bram said he got the revelation
[2:10:03] of the kinsman redeemer this is
[2:10:05] before this is before anybody else spoke
[2:10:08] of IT job had that
[2:10:10] revelation God gave him the revelation
[2:10:13] of the kinsman redeemer and when that
[2:10:16] Revelation broke on him and it was at it
[2:10:19] was after he'd gone through these trials
[2:10:21] he said I know not I think or I hope or
[2:10:24] somebody said so I know I know I
[2:10:29] know my redeemer
[2:10:31] liveth so he recognized that his
[2:10:34] Redeemer was not man but God and he
[2:10:38] realized that all he lost could be
[2:10:41] restored to him listen friends you never
[2:10:44] lost nothing serving Christ everything
[2:10:47] man loses will be given back to God will
[2:10:49] owe nobody when we get to the other side
[2:10:51] you're not going to say well God I did
[2:10:53] this and that and the other God will say
[2:10:54] well look look at all I did for you
[2:10:57] you'll never be able to repay it amen
[2:11:00] that's the God we serve tonight how he
[2:11:02] knows that's
[2:11:03] true notice brother Brandon was in his
[2:11:06] first Pentecostal meeting now I'm not
[2:11:08] I'm not putting off on I'm not saying
[2:11:10] let's go follow the Pentecostal
[2:11:12] organization so don't get nervous but he
[2:11:14] was in the first uh uh non- Baptist
[2:11:17] meeting Pentecostal meeting right and
[2:11:21] the the the minister gets up there
[2:11:24] and brother Bram said I was feeling
[2:11:27] sorry for him and he he said I was
[2:11:28] actually thinking you know this old
[2:11:31] fossil excuse me this old guy you know
[2:11:33] he's 80 years old and rimmed with white
[2:11:35] hair and they had to help him up on the
[2:11:37] platform seems like there's some other
[2:11:39] fine ministers here what he says but
[2:11:42] when that man started preaching and an
[2:11:44] anointed hit him he said he jumped up
[2:11:46] clicked his heels together said you
[2:11:47] don't have enough room up here for me to
[2:11:49] preach right and then he asked the
[2:11:51] question so this is your prophet's first
[2:11:54] Pentecostal meeting and he asked the
[2:11:56] question where were you where were you
[2:12:00] when the sons of God shouted for joy and
[2:12:03] The Morning Star saying notice your
[2:12:06] Prophet is one of those morning Stars
[2:12:08] your Prophet is one of those stars that
[2:12:10] said Here Comes the Sun I'm not that one
[2:12:12] but here it comes I'm reflecting that
[2:12:14] light he's coming he's coming get ready
[2:12:18] here comes a son he's in his very first
[2:12:21] Pentecostal meeting and he's being asked
[2:12:24] where were you now friends if you can
[2:12:26] answer the question where were you
[2:12:29] you'll be able to answer the more
[2:12:30] important question of who were you
[2:12:33] because if you don't know where you were
[2:12:35] you don't know who you were I was in you
[2:12:38] ABA father my spirit Bears witness with
[2:12:42] your spirit I am a Son of God I came
[2:12:45] from your father you will take me home

[2:12:51] was but you brought me back to my right
[2:12:53] mind my right thinking you gave me the
[2:12:56] right thoughts my Amnesia is lifted I
[2:12:59] came from you glory to
[2:13:03] God so job realized everything could be
[2:13:07] restored to
[2:13:08] him somebody say praise the Lord
[2:13:12] pise God breathed down on me one day
[2:13:14] friends and I am pulling over I know I'm
[2:13:17] preachers are ling
[2:13:18] I said I'm pulling over I didn't it's
[2:13:20] like being on a Mountain Road you're
[2:13:22] going around and around you're looking
[2:13:23] for a place to pull over it's a one lane
[2:13:25] road and well anyway I'm wasting my time
[2:13:28] God breathed down on me one day from a
[2:13:31] higher realm a realm that I don't live
[2:13:34] at and he told me you were never born to
[2:13:37] be a sinner I couldn't see it any other
[2:13:40] way he had to come down to tell me that
[2:13:43] you were never ordained from hell I was
[2:13:46] half convinced that I was you were
[2:13:48] always my son you didn't become a son
[2:13:50] when you came down to the altar you came
[2:13:52] to the awareness that you are my son and
[2:13:56] I have been waiting for you to come for
[2:13:59] thousands and thousands of years
[2:14:01] Millions because I thought about you
[2:14:03] before I even made the Earth so that I
[2:14:05] could birth You by my breathed word and
[2:14:08] my spirit and I say to you now arise and
[2:14:12] shine because your light your Malachi 4
[2:14:16] light is come the glory of the Lord is
[2:14:19] risen now upon you let the redeemed of
[2:14:24] the of the Lord say so so I say to you
[2:14:27] arise stand to your feet amen because
[2:14:30] you were born to combat Devils you were
[2:14:33] born to overcome in Satan's Eden not to
[2:14:36] be overcome but to
[2:14:38] overcome arise Shine Your Light is come
[2:14:43] and the glory of the Lord has risen upon
[2:14:46] you brother Bram says when you know when
[2:14:49] that inspiration comes that he's nearby
[2:14:52] friends he said I won't leave you I
[2:14:53] won't forsake you oh blessed be his
[2:14:56] wonderful name oh can I can I just
[2:14:58] introduce something here for just a
[2:15:00] second in the garden Adam left his wife
[2:15:04] right he was told have preeminence keep
[2:15:07] everything in its place the serpent got
[2:15:09] out of its place and he left his wife's
[2:15:12] side the the the believing part of Adam
[2:15:16] was in Adam and as long as Eve stayed
[2:15:19] with Adam and said ain't nothing but the
[2:15:21] truth everything was fine she got away
[2:15:24] from him right and and she
[2:15:29] fell Jesus said look you've been alone
[2:15:32] all of us we maybe there's times where
[2:15:35] you were so alone you thought man
[2:15:36] there's nobody as alone as me none of us
[2:15:39] will ever be as alone as he was when he
[2:15:42] went to the Cross his disciples turned
[2:15:44] their back nature turned its back the
[2:15:47] spirit of God left him the planets
[2:15:49] turned around the Sun refused to shine
[2:15:52] he was there all alone so when he says
[2:15:56] next time next time you feel alone
[2:15:59] remember he said I've been alone I'll
[2:16:02] never leave you never you will never
[2:16:05] know what this is like no matter what
[2:16:07] you're going
[2:16:08] through I will never leave you Adam left
[2:16:11] his wife I won't leave you
[2:16:14] yeah I will be with you even in you so
[2:16:18] the difference between this last Eve and
[2:16:20] the first Eve is the believing part is
[2:16:23] now in you he is in you and that day
[2:16:26] you'll know I'm in the father I'm in you
[2:16:28] and you in me he is in you you cannot be
[2:16:31] deceived and he said I will not leave
[2:16:33] you I will not forsake you come let
[2:16:37] May and the church
[2:16:40] says so where would we be without this
[2:16:43] prophet's message I don't know all your
[2:16:46] background and stories but I I know it's
[2:16:48] supernatural I know it's ordained I know
[2:16:51] that something got a hold of you and you
[2:16:53] don't want it to let you go something
[2:16:56] got a hold of you and you just shake
[2:16:58] your head you were just convinced man if
[2:16:59] I if I just tell them about this and
[2:17:02] that you just shake your head because
[2:17:03] you think this is the
[2:17:05] greatest I'll never be the same it's
[2:17:07] answering all my questions and God's
[2:17:09] vindicating and he's proving these this
[2:17:11] is the true God of the Bible and yet
[2:17:14] other people they don't it doesn't have
[2:17:16] that same effect
[2:17:18] why me
[2:17:20] Lord
[2:17:22] because because he chose you in him
[2:17:26] before the foundation of the world and
[2:17:28] he said you will be this this this and
[2:17:29] this and you're coming to that
[2:17:32] realization where would we be tonight
[2:17:34] friends without that word that we can
[2:17:36] sit under and let it raise us up in in
[2:17:40] his thinking so that we could think his
[2:17:43] thoughts and not our thoughts just the
[2:17:45] fact that there is a better thought
[2:17:49] ought to cause us to
[2:17:51] Rejoice this message lifts us up beyond
[2:17:54] our own thinking your Prophet said when
[2:17:57] the a when the Angels picked him up he
[2:17:59] says I wasn't thinking my own
[2:18:01] thoughts we get so wrapped up in our own
[2:18:04] natural thinking and it causes us to
[2:18:07] struggle with the message for our day
[2:18:09] our human Minds can be so polluted at
[2:18:11] times and we have thoughts that are
[2:18:14] hidden in our past that can be pulled up
[2:18:16] in life
[2:18:18] and it's stored in the
[2:18:20] memory cells of humanity our natural
[2:18:23] thinking is limited a lot of times to
[2:18:26] our human
[2:18:28] experiences I'm so glad that God has
[2:18:30] given me something to erase my human
[2:18:32] thoughts and to bring my thinking
[2:18:35] subject to the word and I'm so glad that
[2:18:39] this Living Word will discern my
[2:18:41] thoughts it'll scrub me where I don't
[2:18:44] know that I need to be scrubbed when we
[2:18:47] try to lead ourselves with our own
[2:18:49] thoughts there's no way for us to do it
[2:18:51] without the pollution of our past so we
[2:18:54] need a way to wash that all away but we
[2:18:58] have no shower that can there's no brush
[2:19:01] that I can pull the top of my head off
[2:19:04] and go like this so I'm so glad that the
[2:19:08] word of God can wash me inside out and
[2:19:10] knows what I need I'm so glad that every
[2:19:14] time I hear the anointed word I am being
[2:19:16] washed by the water of the word can you
[2:19:19] say Amen to that I'm so glad tonight
[2:19:22] friends that God has thoughts concerning
[2:19:24] me today that are so much higher than
[2:19:27] the thoughts that I could ever think God
[2:19:29] has thoughts in Minneapolis Minnesota
[2:19:31] here tonight that are so much higher
[2:19:34] than lgbtq and whatever else it is are
[2:19:37] going to run out of alphabet letters God
[2:19:39] has the final word God has the greatest
[2:19:42] thought God's thoughts are perfect God's
[2:19:44] thoughts cannot pass away God's thoughts
[2:19:47] will be manifested and I'm looking at
[2:19:50] the manifestation of God's thoughts here
[2:19:52] on the earth in 2023 I'm so glad for
[2:19:56] this evening light and it's shining in
[2:19:58] this hour and it's called me out of
[2:20:00] Darkness into this bright future into
[2:20:02] the fullness of the Sun and I'm so glad
[2:20:04] to be standing here with you tonight I'm
[2:20:07] so glad I don't have to go where my
[2:20:08] natural thoughts will lead me to I'm so
[2:20:11] glad that I can walk where the Eternal
[2:20:13] thoughts of God will take me because his
[2:20:15] word will not return into him void but
[2:20:17] it will accomplish what he said it would
[2:20:19] do you are his eternal thoughts tonight
[2:20:22] let's stand you are his thoughts that
[2:20:26] word must be made flesh that word must
[2:20:29] fulfill its purpose the Tabernacle of
[2:20:32] the Living God is on the earth tonight
[2:20:34] friends and his voice is sounding forth

[2:20:58] finishers of the race so I say tonight
[2:21:02] arise and shine for thy light is come
[2:21:06] let me leave you with this thought I was
[2:21:08] headed to South Africa for some Easter
[2:21:10] meetings
[2:21:11] and every minister they travail there I
[2:21:16] feel sorry for the denominations they
[2:21:18] have to hunt for something they have to
[2:21:20] find some old dead rabbit or something
[2:21:22] on the side of the road to try to feed
[2:21:24] somebody we don't have that problem
[2:21:27] there we don't have a problem of looking
[2:21:30] for something to bring to the people our
[2:21:33] problem is what is the word in due
[2:21:35] season what is it that we need right now
[2:21:38] Lord what is it that your people need
[2:21:41] and we agonize over that we don't take
[2:21:43] it lightly so I was it was weighing
[2:21:47] heavy on my heart and I was thinking
[2:21:50] about going a certain direction and I
[2:21:51] just needed a little confirmation from
[2:21:53] the Lord we stopped at uh the airport in
[2:21:57] uh in
[2:21:59] London my wife was with me and my wife
[2:22:03] uh she saw Baker's there was a suit shop
[2:22:08] inside the the airport and it said uh
[2:22:11] Baker's fine clothes my last name's
[2:22:14] Baker so she says honey why don't you go
[2:22:17] over and stand by that that you know
[2:22:20] where it says Baker's fine whatever why
[2:22:22] don't you go stand there and I'll get
[2:22:24] your picture and so I went and stood
[2:22:25] there she took my
[2:22:28] picture I didn't look at the picture
[2:22:31] waited until we got to South Africa in
[2:22:35] the picture there was a great big can
[2:22:37] like a you know like a fruit juice can
[2:22:40] or something and it had some writing on
[2:22:41] it but I didn't look at it it wasn't
[2:22:44] until I was trying to narrow down on the
[2:22:47] thought just before I was going to have
[2:22:50] to bring the message to the meeting and
[2:22:52] I looked at that that picture and it
[2:22:55] said on the picture Mr Baker it's your
