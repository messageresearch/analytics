[40:55] one praise the
[40:58] Lord and then she this is who am I
[41:02] speaking to I said I'm the one you know
[41:04] and we went back and forth a little bit
[41:07] and
[41:08] uh and then uh I I felt I felt almost
[41:12] like I was frustrating him he was about
[41:13] to shut his phone off so I said I will
[41:17] be I will be you know I'll be guilty for
[41:20] doing this so I I just call there a way
[41:22] I call him so when I call him he knew
[41:24] straight I was the one he saw you sound
[41:26] different I said yeah I'm under the
[41:28] weather a little bit so you hear my
[41:30] voice uh a little bit cracky tonight so
[41:33] just bear with me amen but uh uh uh
[41:37] let's let's look at this let's look at
[41:40] this we we just read this this verse
[41:42] caught caught my attention here uh uh uh
[41:47] uh when we read this it it caught my
[41:50] attention just now beautiful verse uh
[41:53] that's verse eight you know uh uh look
[41:56] to yourself that we lose not those
[41:59] things which we have rough amen that we
[42:03] lose not those things which we have
[42:05] rough what actually it is that we lose
[42:07] not those things which we have labored
[42:09] with God where we have brought ourself
[42:13] you know if you start looking at things
[42:15] around you and looking at other people
[42:16] you will lose your personal value amen
[42:19] look to yourself you you you are
[42:22] responsible to be able to watch over
[42:25] there
[42:26] and uh I never saw it until tonight
[42:28] reading it just caught my mind look to
[42:31] yourself that we lose not those things
[42:33] which we have Rob but that we receive a
[42:36] full
[42:37] reward praise the Lord you have to know
[42:40] in you is a hidden treasure amen you
[42:44] have Heavenly treasure in eting vessel
[42:47] and you need to watch over it that's if
[42:49] God will hold you account for anything I
[42:52] mean he will hold you account for that
[42:54] thing more than any other thing
[42:56] praise the Lord but also realize tonight
[42:59] another thing that caught my mind here
[43:01] is that there are 13 verses in this in
[43:05] this chapter and 13 is the number of a
[43:11] woman praise the Lord 13 is the number
[43:15] of a woman whether I mean uh uh yeah
[43:18] this this Bible was written many years
[43:21] before uh uh you know uh all of these
[43:25] things were said before even the prophet
[43:27] came to tell us that 13 is the number of
[43:30] a woman he said you look through all the
[43:31] scripture you will see that uh uh uh
[43:34] Joshua had the people to go around the
[43:37] the world 13 times if you actually look
[43:39] at it it was 13 times and we shouldn't
[43:42] go through that calculation because we
[43:43] have done that over and over when Ruth
[43:46] was going to be redeemed and uh uh the
[43:49] Israel has they has a they has a culture
[43:52] when they say call the Elders the ERS
[43:55] have to be 10 men the ERS have to be 10
[44:00] men and uh uh uh so you were realized
[44:04] that there were 10
[44:06] men boas make it
[44:09] 11 the nearest Kings there was a man
[44:13] that was the nearest Kings the one that
[44:16] kick his shoes off make it 12 the 13
[44:19] person was the woman that was concerned
[44:21] Ruth she makes it
[44:23] 13 and uh and and you can you I mean we
[44:26] can go through the scriptures we have we
[44:28] have speak on these things many times we
[44:30] don't want to but it just it just grabed
[44:32] my attention that Paul that John is
[44:35] talking about the elected lady he's he's
[44:38] he's writing about the elected lady and
[44:41] the Holy Spirit uh you know uh uh uh
[44:44] make it that these men that wrote the
[44:46] Bible had to make this second episode of
[44:50] John 13 verse that that that just stood
[44:53] up to me uh it might not mean not
[44:56] nothing don't don't make it a big deal
[44:57] but uh uh to me uh it's uh I I I felt I
[45:02] felt a little sense of edification when
[45:04] I when I was reading through and and saw
[45:07] that and uh science even prove it you
[45:11] know science prove it that the woman uh
[45:13] she's on 13 cycles of her life in a
[45:17] year if you read if you read the count
[45:19] it you take count of it that's exactly
[45:22] what it is she's under 13 cycles of her
[45:24] life in the year it's proven by science
[45:27] now so uh uh
[45:32] uh praise the
[45:35] Lord your thoughts are firing at
[45:39] me amen I can feel your
[45:44] thoughts what is he
[45:48] saying are we together
[45:52] amen you know he a church that makes a
[45:54] good preacher
[45:56] amen
[45:58] amen if the people can bear with you and
[46:01] your foolishness it be a good preacher
[46:04] Paul says the preaching of the Gospel is
[46:06] foolishness
[46:10] so for them that believe are we together
[46:15] amen
[46:16] amen so we want to talk about the
[46:19] elected lady from the beginning John
[46:21] here writing this episode and remember
[46:25] now we've been on of this thing since
[46:27] the beginning of the year you know there
[46:28] are people that that that have different
[46:30] different approach the brother from the
[46:33] UK they had preached for us last year I
[46:36] think March he was around in March he
[46:39] speak for us brother Crosby it was
[46:44] 2023 so he was preaching on 23 and he
[46:48] took the Lord's sh the the the what is
[46:53] it from from David Psalm 23
[46:56] so Psalm 23 was his message he was
[46:59] beginning with because it was
[47:02] 23 you know and I picked that up also
[47:06] last year on the convention there in
[47:08] South Africa there's a brother from
[47:11] Namibia that that were called to greet
[47:13] the church and he took 23 23 23 23 I
[47:16] mean beautiful way he brought it I said
[47:18] wow these guys are
[47:21] smart praise the Lord I'm not built that
[47:24] way I'm not a numbers man not too good
[47:27] in mou anyway so uh but I I saw this uh
[47:32] uh uh thing about the
[47:34] beginning and it all came from uh uh uh
[47:38] talking about the impact that the vision
[47:41] of pmos had on
[47:43] John praise the Lord and if John is a
[47:46] type of the bribe that Vision will
[47:49] impact this bride
[47:52] also praise the Lord amen
[47:56] it will it will change the way we look
[47:58] at things in the
[47:59] scripture now this this is not a man's
[48:02] doing this is not a man's doing if you
[48:05] are in the in the hands of the Holy
[48:06] Ghost he's going to deal with you just
[48:09] the way that he want to deal with
[48:12] you amen praise the Lord so it is not
[48:16] something that we trying to force down
[48:18] your throat no
[48:20] no I mean we are not trying to force it
[48:23] down your tro we're just trying to to
[48:25] edify you and say open your eyes there
[48:27] are a lot of things that is happening
[48:30] amen there are a lot of things that is
[48:32] happening around
[48:34] us live for your head your Redemption
[48:37] dur night so just like I said uh this uh
[48:41] 13 verses caught my attention and I'm
[48:44] going to talk on the elected lady from
[48:46] the beginning John says there he onto
[48:50] the elect lady and her
[48:53] children praise the Lord now as he Clos
[48:57] as he closed the chapter the last verse
[49:01] he said the children of the elect sister
[49:05] greet thee so this gave us an idea that
[49:08] John was not talking to a particular
[49:11] lady she he was talking to a church
[49:14] right because he was bringing greetings
[49:16] from the other elect
[49:19] church so he was saying your uh your
[49:23] sister you know uh all the children of
[49:27] uh the elect sister which mean the
[49:29] church members of the other churches
[49:31] send greetings to
[49:33] you are we together amen so this this
[49:38] kind of forgive us uh uh uh an idea here
[49:43] that uh
[49:45] John on the island of pmos that's what
[49:48] we want to look at going back to the
[49:50] beginning
[49:52] John he got he got a
[49:56] Vision or he was imparted to see
[50:00] something that that was coming in
[50:04] view that he can take back to the
[50:07] beginning Revelation chapter 19 let's
[50:09] read
[50:11] that Revelation chapter
[50:15] 19
[50:17] sorry Revelation chapter
[50:22] 19 praise the
[50:24] Lord
[50:33] are we
[50:46] together you know we have this this uh
[50:49] hand sanitizer on the year is it's been
[50:52] very helpful for me most especially
[50:54] during the time of communion
[50:56] and uh uh I always wash my hands before
[51:01] I come up but as a preacher I have to
[51:03] preach I touch the pullit and do some
[51:05] different things and then just before
[51:07] commun I always used that it's always
[51:09] it's been a
[51:10] blessing praise the Lord I'm telling you
[51:13] some of the things I do when your eyes
[51:14] are
[51:17] closed let's read verse
[51:20] seven I got to get a preaching
[51:23] tonight I got to get a preaching brother
[51:25] won stop there get a preaching tonight
[51:28] let's read verse
[51:31] 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[51:34] honor to him for the marriage of the
[51:36] Lamb is come and his wife have made
[51:40] herself
[51:41] ready and to her was granted that she
[51:45] should be array in fine laning clean and
[51:48] white for the fine laning is the
[51:51] righteousness of the Saints now realize
[51:53] that John is seeing all of these things
[51:55] on a vision an angel is speaking to him
[51:58] praise the Lord
[52:00] amen
[52:05] amen now as as you will go on as you
[52:09] will go on we speak we we we spoke on
[52:11] this he comes down here and uh verse 9
[52:15] and he said uh and he said unto me the
[52:18] angel said unto me right right John
[52:21] blessed are they which I called unto the
[52:24] marage supp of the lamb and he said unto
[52:28] me these are the truth saying of God
[52:33] these are the truth saying that look
[52:36] this this is not just a plane these
[52:37] things are going to happen amen there's
[52:40] going to be a marriage of the
[52:42] Lamb these are the TR saying of God the
[52:46] angel is making emphasis to John this is
[52:50] not something to make you just to create
[52:52] an interest for you to go to heaven
[52:54] whether you go or not is going to
[52:59] happen look you know Heaven is going to
[53:01] be beautiful it's it's going to be
[53:03] beautiful those things does not appeal
[53:05] to the soul right it can only play on
[53:09] the spirit for a
[53:11] while these are the truth saying of God
[53:15] Amen praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh
[53:21] I think I went ahead of myself I should
[53:23] have read from verse one down to 7 and I
[53:26] read from 7 to 9 but that's
[53:28] fine and uh so John on a vision he's
[53:33] seing this thing and now since since
[53:38] Jesus introduced himself to John uh uh
[53:42] in Revelation chapter 3:14 as the
[53:44] beginning of the creation of God John
[53:48] now on our steud now that's the way we
[53:50] are looking at it John now has started
[53:53] to bring everything back to the
[53:54] beginning beginning whatever he sees
[53:57] here in Genesis he brings back to the
[54:00] beginning because you have to also
[54:02] remember that what we have in the Bible
[54:05] as the beginning of creation the the the
[54:09] uh Genesis the beginning of creation the
[54:12] the the the time of Noah all of those
[54:14] things were written by Moses but Moses
[54:17] was not there Moses was given those
[54:20] account by
[54:23] Vision when God told Moses in the
[54:25] mountain uh 40 days and 40 nights God
[54:29] gave him the Bible says God show him a
[54:32] vision about the PN of
[54:37] heaven so all of these things in the
[54:40] first day God created this the second
[54:42] day God created Moses was not there he
[54:45] wrote all of those things by
[54:48] vision and
[54:50] because the people believe that God
[54:53] spoke to Moses they believe it amen and
[54:56] you and myself we believe
[54:59] it science is the one that is trying to
[55:02] question oh that it was a big bang it
[55:04] was oh we don't believe what the Bible
[55:06] says you don't believe what the Bible
[55:07] say because you don't believe the
[55:12] prophet praise the Lord amen Moses is
[55:16] the one that wrote
[55:21] it and anybody coming up coming up to
[55:24] challenge
[55:26] Moses Authority on Genesis
[55:29] 1 you're just kicking yourself out of
[55:31] the
[55:35] Kingdom praise the
[55:38] Lord you think about Moses coming down
[55:41] from the mountain and he's giving this
[55:43] to the people and the and no no let the
[55:46] Council of others come down and sit down
[55:48] let's sit down and and then we can be
[55:51] able to look at all of these things and
[55:53] you know and prove whether
[55:55] uh uh it's truth that uh you know
[55:58] whether we can prove it that it is Tru
[56:00] that God gave it to you I mean it was
[56:02] just it was just
[56:04] uh you see God God did something when
[56:08] the people challenged Moses after
[56:09] tempting him many years and tempting him
[56:12] and and and arguing and gossiping about
[56:14] him and everything when God brought him
[56:16] down to that Showdown where he opened
[56:18] the Earth and and put all the people
[56:21] there close the Earth give a m grave
[56:26] praise the Lord you think about
[56:29] that he opened the Earth and swallowed
[56:32] all of those h h a thousand of people
[56:36] that was standing with Koran and d and
[56:38] fasting against Moses and he closed the
[56:45] Earth praise the
[56:52] Lord you know Hans have never
[56:57] change praise the
[57:00] Lord I'm sure there were people that
[57:02] were stay doubting and people that were
[57:04] stay struggling and people that were
[57:05] stay
[57:07] arguing
[57:08] but for the many of
[57:11] them the fear of the
[57:14] Lord the fear of the
[57:17] Lord praise the
[57:21] Lord in the book of Acts Acts chapter 5
[57:24] God did the same thing in the church
[57:27] service just like we are
[57:30] having a man ananas and his wife God
[57:35] allowed the church to
[57:38] witness a striking
[57:42] death and that that same God live
[57:45] tonight is the same God that we are
[57:49] serving praise the
[57:51] Lord amen is the same God we we are

[57:59] Titus to you and say you got to be
[58:00] careful God will that's not what I'm

[58:11] attention he has a way of putting you to
[58:16] a place where you can know that he's he
[58:19] he he exists and he's the one that alter
[58:22] your life and he's in control

[58:28] way of doing
[58:32] it praise the Lord I don't know where
[58:34] I'm going but I'm going anyway this week
[58:37] I was thinking about that thing and it
[58:39] it just being on my mind you know I was
[58:41] talking with a friend of mine back home
[58:43] and uh uh uh you see the age you know
[58:49] the time that we are living in and you
[58:51] have you have these things that is in
[58:53] the in in in the minds of the Young
[58:55] Generation oh you know I I I I want to
[58:57] be financially independent you know H uh
[59:01] you know and I want to be
[59:03] uh uh what is the next thing to talk
[59:06] about poverty you know every poverty you
[59:08] know and and you know fighting against
[59:10] poverty and financially independ and I
[59:13] was just I was just thinking about that
[59:15] trying to put it in the
[59:20] context until we leave this
[59:23] life will always have something to
[59:26] depend
[59:28] on praise the Lord and as Sons and
[59:32] Daughters of God God don't want your

[59:42] he want to bless you with fine eyes but
[59:45] he want your Independence to be on the
[59:47] word is the word that bring us
[59:49] independence him that the son set free
[59:52] is free inde let me tell you what
[59:54] happened let me tell you what happened
[59:56] if you just if you just look at it in in
[59:58] that in that in that
[1:00:01] context like Jesus said no man can serve
[1:00:03] two
[1:00:06] masters praise the
[1:00:08] Lord so you find all of these people
[1:00:11] that are streaming to these things they
[1:00:13] are streaming to this thing you know and
[1:00:16] and and get out of poverty and then you
[1:00:18] know and and they are streaming to those
[1:00:19] things there is
[1:00:22] always always
[1:00:25] a trap the devil is he stay
[1:00:29] there praise the Lord you have to

[1:00:50] there is no connection of of this thing
[1:00:53] that you are believing
[1:00:55] there is no
[1:00:56] connection so you find all of these
[1:00:59] people that are screaming to all of
[1:01:01] these things uh uh uh look think about
[1:01:03] it you think about
[1:01:05] it it was not strange to almighty God he
[1:01:09] knew being the creator of Heaven and
[1:01:11] Earth he knew exactly how Solomon would
[1:01:14] have ended right and the Bible says that
[1:01:18] if you even read the scripture if you
[1:01:20] read the scripture and put it in context
[1:01:23] it was not Solomon praying he was not
[1:01:26] praying he had a
[1:01:29] dream and the dream came from the desire
[1:01:33] of his heart God saw the desire of his
[1:01:37] heart how am I going to lead these
[1:01:41] people praise the
[1:01:45] Lord and God came down and and and told
[1:01:48] him and say
[1:01:50] Solomon I've seen the desire of your
[1:01:53] heart that you want to Le my people and
[1:01:58] because you have desired
[1:02:01] this I'm going to bless
[1:02:05] you I'm going to bless you praise the
[1:02:09] Lord I will give you
[1:02:12] wisdom I will also give you riches and
[1:02:17] none of us that want to be financially
[1:02:19] free financially independent none of us
[1:02:22] will reach to Solomon level
[1:02:25] no matter how much we
[1:02:28] strive even the seat he was sitting in
[1:02:31] they go around
[1:02:33] it it can build another
[1:02:37] country it was God
[1:02:40] giving the Bible says what God gives he
[1:02:43] added no sorrow to
[1:02:49] it praise the
[1:02:53] Lord
[1:02:55] I'm not trying to rob you of your
[1:02:57] Ambitions it's good for you to have
[1:02:59] Ambitions praise the Lord but look to
[1:03:03] the Lord for the
[1:03:05] result if not you will start cutting
[1:03:08] Corners with the
[1:03:09] word you will start cutting corners and
[1:03:12] when you start cutting Corners you are
[1:03:14] just cheating
[1:03:16] yourself you are just cheating
[1:03:23] yourself
[1:03:26] Solomon at the end of his
[1:03:29] life he said Lord just give me
[1:03:34] enough to carry me through the rest of
[1:03:36] my
[1:03:38] life I don't want to lose everything
[1:03:41] I'll blaspheme against your
[1:03:43] name and because I had too much I've
[1:03:46] have gone into idolatry where am I going
[1:03:49] tonight supposed to be talking about the
[1:03:50] elected
[1:03:52] lady praise the Lord
[1:03:56] so we see here that
[1:03:59] John hearing this call from Revelation
[1:04:03] chapter
[1:04:05] 19 he seen the bride and the Bible says
[1:04:08] as you read down John he saw the New
[1:04:11] Jerusalem coming down like a bride a
[1:04:13] door for her husband and all of those
[1:04:16] things that he that he's thinking about
[1:04:18] no
[1:04:21] wonder I think that John could imagine
[1:04:25] in his mind what it was like for for for
[1:04:28] Adam and
[1:04:31] Eve how their marriage ceremony
[1:04:35] was I think John in his mind T about it
[1:04:39] Genesis chapter one let's go right
[1:04:43] there Genesis chapter
[1:04:52] 1 praise the Lord
[1:04:57] you find all of these fancy teachers on
[1:04:59] the
[1:05:00] word you know you find all these fancy
[1:05:02] teachers they you know they study they
[1:05:05] they get tickle by think and and and
[1:05:07] they try to show here that and and and
[1:05:10] and God said let us let us may uh let us
[1:05:13] may man in our image praise the
[1:05:18] Lord verse 27 and so God created Man In
[1:05:22] His Image in the image of God created he
[1:05:26] him male and female created he them they
[1:05:29] tried to run with this to show that
[1:05:32] there was a man on Earth before
[1:05:36] Adam praise the
[1:05:37] Lord amen they tried to show they tried
[1:05:41] to use the to show that there was a
[1:05:43] civilization on Earth before Adam but it
[1:05:45] will not run through the
[1:05:50] scripture you cannot run it through the
[1:05:53] scripture if there was a man on the
[1:05:55] earth before Adam Jesus would not be the
[1:05:57] second
[1:06:00] Adam Jesus supposed to be that man
[1:06:02] because he was the
[1:06:07] first and all of those things the four
[1:06:10] on people that have itching ears the
[1:06:12] thing is a revelation now
[1:06:15] wow there was another man before Adam
[1:06:18] you see that's that man have a children
[1:06:21] that's
[1:06:22] where King went to get his wife and all
[1:06:25] sorts of things oh my God
[1:06:28] right I will tell you what are you like
[1:06:32] it or not we thank God for a prophet
[1:06:35] amen amen praise the lord we never made
[1:06:39] him a
[1:06:40] prophet

[1:06:46] only saw his ministry in the pages of
[1:06:48] the word a promise to our
[1:06:53] day
[1:06:58] are we together now so uh we see here
[1:07:02] the Bible says so God created Man In His
[1:07:05] Image St John 412 said God is a spirit
[1:07:11] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:07:13] Him in spirit and in truth so if God
[1:07:16] created this man in His image this
[1:07:18] Genesis 126 man was a spirit man he
[1:07:22] didn't had a body
[1:07:28] and that Spirit man was both male and
[1:07:31] female God was representing both the the
[1:07:35] the male and the
[1:07:37] female then in Genesis chapter 2 that
[1:07:40] was where God created Man Out of the
[1:07:43] Dust of the earth and then he put that
[1:07:46] Spirit man into that
[1:07:52] body
[1:07:55] are we together but what what I want to
[1:07:57] bring bring to you here is there God
[1:08:00] created man in In His Image male and
[1:08:04] female created he
[1:08:08] them and God blessed them and said unto

[1:11:19] been given to
[1:11:22] us we need to use that word and prepare
[1:11:29] ourself praise the Lord and the devil
[1:11:33] want to trouble our mind I mean why why
[1:11:36] listen to him and carry yourself through
[1:11:38] a depressing State why can't you take
[1:11:40] the promises from the
[1:11:46] word praise the Lord I can tell you what
[1:11:49] the word says but I can't keep it on
[1:11:51] your
[1:11:52] mind
[1:11:54] I try to keep you on my
[1:11:57] mind as much as I
[1:11:59] can so many says if the Lord will take
[1:12:04] this evil spirit okay yeah BR addressing
[1:12:06] the same thing yeah so many say if the
[1:12:08] Lord will take this evil spirit from me
[1:12:10] from drinking or from gambling from
[1:12:12] lying stealing I will serve him but
[1:12:15] that's up to you see you got something
[1:12:19] you you you got to do something
[1:12:22] too praise the Lord this Supernatural
[1:12:25] Deliverance does not
[1:12:27] work God is say God he can deliver his
[1:12:30] people any way he choose amen but you
[1:12:33] see the the the the the the way the
[1:12:35] principle work if you look back in the
[1:12:37] Book of Judges you you will see God gave
[1:12:40] them a promise he said I will send HS to
[1:12:43] fight for you he said I will drive them
[1:12:45] up God himself came down in the form of
[1:12:48] of of the captain of the Lord host and
[1:12:51] God gave them many Supernatural
[1:12:53] Deliverance but when you get to the end
[1:12:55] of the book God told him because you
[1:12:59] allow these things you have to fight it
[1:13:04] out if now they're going to be torn in
[1:13:06] your flesh so you see when we gave our
[1:13:09] heart to the Lord the Lord comes and he
[1:13:11] do Supernatural things he takes things
[1:13:14] away from our life and then we get in
[1:13:16] our work and we get so complacent now we
[1:13:19] are believers you know I'm not
[1:13:21] legalistic people just like to be
[1:13:23] legalistic and before you realize we
[1:13:25] start picking up the very same thing
[1:13:27] that the Lord has delivered us
[1:13:29] from and when we trap ourself in it we
[1:13:32] say oh God please deliver me no he said
[1:13:35] you got to fight it okay you got to
[1:13:39] fight
[1:13:45] it that's the principle that is in the
[1:13:48] word at the beginning of of of of Joshua
[1:13:52] God delivered the people
[1:13:54] he sent Hil Stones he did many
[1:13:57] Supernatural thing to deliver them and
[1:13:59] that is the same way with us he Deliver
[1:14:01] us through the preaching of the word
[1:14:03] many Supernatural things there are
[1:14:05] habits that left our life we did not
[1:14:07] practice for them to
[1:14:09] live God took it away amen
[1:14:13] amen but when we tramped on the blood of
[1:14:15] Jesus Christ when we count the grace of
[1:14:21] God yeah we are we we that Grace I'm I'm
[1:14:24] I'm
[1:14:27] free so BR B says
[1:14:32] here if the Lord will take this evil
[1:14:35] spirit people says he said from drinking
[1:14:37] gambling and stealing I will self him
[1:14:39] but that's but that's up to you see you
[1:14:42] got something to do they that they that
[1:14:45] overcome shall inherit all
[1:14:48] things you have power to do
[1:14:51] it but you must be willing to lay it
[1:14:56] down see it she has made herself ready I
[1:15:00] like that word you see God could not
[1:15:04] push you through a pipe pull you out on
[1:15:07] the other side and says blessed is he
[1:15:09] that overcome you had nothing to
[1:15:11] overcome he just push you through but
[1:15:14] you have got to make decisions for
[1:15:19] yourself I have to make decision for
[1:15:21] myself in doing this
[1:15:24] we show our faith and respect to God
[1:15:29] when we make decisions and it's a
[1:15:31] Earnest decision as far as my conviction
[1:15:35] this is the way I see the
[1:15:37] word this is this is the way I seeing
[1:15:39] I'm not seeing it to be to be popular
[1:15:41] that's my conviction that's what brother
[1:15:43] Bram is saying God respect that it's a
[1:15:46] respect to
[1:15:51] God are we together
[1:15:54] now he says this this is going to happen
[1:15:56] as sure as there is God is there is
[1:15:58] going to be a
[1:16:01] bride so John under this vision is
[1:16:04] seeing the he's seeing the elect lady
[1:16:06] All Through the
[1:16:08] Ages he's seeing why God how to how to
[1:16:12] how to use H Rahab the whole city will
[1:16:16] fall only one woman for one woman's
[1:16:21] sake God will keep a war only that war
[1:16:25] that that war the same War where the
[1:16:27] spies came down was the only war that
[1:16:30] was
[1:16:32] standing and as soon as RAB and her
[1:16:34] family I don't even know how they got
[1:16:36] down maybe she used the same
[1:16:39] cord and as those men are you sure this
[1:16:43] thing is not going to
[1:16:48] fall I'm sure that John could see in a
[1:16:51] life of teror that she she was an elect
[1:16:57] lady praise the Lord because you see
[1:17:00] just like Peter Peter
[1:17:03] struggle with his vision I have never
[1:17:05] eaten anything that is
[1:17:08] unclean the Jews they could not see
[1:17:11] there there they could not understand
[1:17:14] God dealing with the
[1:17:18] Gentiles they couldn't they couldn't
[1:17:20] understand it it had to take the Holy
[1:17:23] Ghost it had to take the New Testament
[1:17:29] Church that's the reason why those Jews
[1:17:31] they stood against Paul they say he's
[1:17:33] bringing unclean people into the into
[1:17:36] the temple because they never wanted the
[1:17:38] Gentile that were that were that were
[1:17:40] coming to Salvation to come into the
[1:17:44] temple praise the Lord sometimes when we
[1:17:48] the same thing we do sometimes we we you
[1:17:50] know we judge people by our our
[1:17:52] denomination they are not dressing like
[1:17:53] us and you know what we must not allow
[1:17:55] them to come in the church and all of
[1:17:57] that okay let's just move forward we
[1:17:58] don't have
[1:18:00] time are we
[1:18:02] together now so you can see here he saw
[1:18:06] the elect lady I knew I was struggle to
[1:18:09] bring this tonight because uh there just
[1:18:11] so much on my mind to just uh uh uh but
[1:18:15] we trust the
[1:18:16] Lord
[1:18:18] amen let's look at another thing brother
[1:18:21] Bram said in uh in invisible Union it's
[1:18:24] a quote that we all love talking about
[1:18:26] uh de Moody we all love that let's look
[1:18:29] at that maybe we find a place to close
[1:18:31] here I can pick this up another time I'm
[1:18:34] having a whole year to preach in the
[1:18:35] beginning
[1:18:38] amen praise the Lord when you are tired
[1:18:41] you just tell the deacons they will come
[1:18:42] and see
[1:18:45] me invisible un brother B says Mr M
[1:18:49] after reading Romans 7 ran into the
[1:18:52] Street and the first man he met he said
[1:18:57] to him do you know
[1:19:00] Grace and the man replied Grace who Mr
[1:19:04] Moody said the grace of God now Romans
[1:19:08] chapter 7 is where Paul says a woman
[1:19:11] cannot be married until her first
[1:19:14] husband died
[1:19:16] amen Dr Moi could see the grace of God
[1:19:20] in that applying to us but you see the
[1:19:25] picture here you got you got to see the
[1:19:27] picture
[1:19:28] right our first husband did not
[1:19:32] die the grace there is that we
[1:19:38] die we died and came to newness of Life
[1:19:43] praise the Lord that's the reason why he
[1:19:46] think he still have right to
[1:19:48] us but the grace of God brought us
[1:19:51] through the the the the the death burier
[1:19:54] and resurrection of Jesus
[1:19:58] Christ you see when when you understand
[1:20:00] these things and you run it through the
[1:20:02] way the Apostle Paul see it you will see
[1:20:05] why the apostles were they were very
[1:20:08] strong on on the revelation of baptism
[1:20:10] that came to
[1:20:11] them they knew what the church was
[1:20:14] imposing on the
[1:20:20] people that is the grace of God
[1:20:23] the grace of God is that we were the one
[1:20:26] that
[1:20:29] died
[1:20:32] amen we were the one that
[1:20:35] died am I preaching the false Doctrine
[1:20:40] tonight you think the first husband died
[1:20:42] no no no no no no no that's the reason
[1:20:45] why he can remind you of your past he
[1:20:48] can remind you of the fun time you used
[1:20:51] to have you know those days
[1:20:54] but you ask him I don't know what you're
[1:20:55] talking about that's not
[1:20:58] me the person you're talking about is
[1:21:01] that
[1:21:03] one praise the Lord the one you talking
[1:21:05] about she's being dead he died long time
[1:21:10] praise the Lord didn't you witness his
[1:21:12] barrier when they took him down to the
[1:21:14] water and he went down in the name of
[1:21:17] the Lord Jesus Christ and he rose up in
[1:21:20] newness of life that's what the Bible
[1:21:22] says
[1:21:25] yes praise the Lord now you see it will
[1:21:29] it will make sense to you when I read
[1:21:30] this thing that brother Bram said in uh
[1:21:33] in uh in in in in marriage and divorce
[1:21:36] that the Virgin say of the church is the
[1:21:38] word when God call you a virgin bride
[1:21:41] it's not it's not your body it's not
[1:21:43] your activities it's not yourself the
[1:21:46] Virgin bride is you taking the pure word
[1:21:50] your identification to the pure word
[1:21:53] that's what makes you a virgin why
[1:21:56] because when you come out behold all all
[1:22:00] things are pass away all things becomes
[1:22:06] new praise the Lord and your baptism is
[1:22:10] a word baptism it's not a church baptism
[1:22:12] it's a word
[1:22:14] baptism so when you come up in that
[1:22:16] newness of life amen amen praise the
[1:22:19] Lord he don't have a whole he he does
[1:22:22] not have a ho on you he goes and bring
[1:22:25] the old marriage
[1:22:27] certificate and says look you see that's
[1:22:30] that's that's my
[1:22:32] wife he belongs to
[1:22:34] me praise the

[1:24:03] wife glory be to God the Bible says the
[1:24:07] next day when the Lord when the Lord
[1:24:11] visited neor David raised up his hand he
[1:24:14] said thank God I've have not I have not
[1:24:17] put the blood on my
[1:24:20] hands praise the Lord amen
[1:24:23] thank God but you have to also realize
[1:24:26] that it was because of Abigail she St
[1:24:28] she stepped right into the
[1:24:30] Gap she was an elected
[1:24:34] woman for that time for that purpose so
[1:24:39] God played the elected lady all through
[1:24:41] John seeing this woman he seeing this
[1:24:44] woman Behold The Marriage of the Lamb
[1:24:47] come and see the Lamb's
[1:24:50] wife he's looking at the vision and he's
[1:24:52] also looking back in his mind and seeing
[1:24:55] All Through the Ages how God using
[1:24:58] different people playing
[1:25:02] out Amazing Grace how sweet that sound
[1:25:05] that safe a rush like me Grace precious
[1:25:08] Grace more of Grace to know Ah that's my
[1:25:11] best part of this quote there is more of
[1:25:14] Grace to know amen if you think that you
[1:25:17] know the grace of God you have not come
[1:25:19] close to it you have not stretched
[1:25:22] yourself surface of God's grace there
[1:25:24] are more grace to
[1:25:28] know praise the
[1:25:33] Lord that's the reason why it does not
[1:25:35] benefit you and myself to hold anything
[1:25:38] against
[1:25:40] anybody because we don't have Grace to
[1:25:42] give to nobody it's only God that give
[1:25:45] Grace there's more of Grace to know for
[1:25:48] for it is by Grace we are saved not not
[1:25:51] by what we can do and may I add to this
[1:25:55] woman Grace now brother Bram here John
[1:25:59] call her the elected lady brother bam is
[1:26:01] calling her grace he's calling the
[1:26:03] elected Lady Grace may I add to this
[1:26:05] woman this Miss Grace I'm going to talk
[1:26:08] about her you know the Bible declared
[1:26:11] said to the to the elect lady if you
[1:26:14] notice elect comes from the word elected
[1:26:17] lady one lady among all the other ladies
[1:26:21] was
[1:26:23] elected like the Virgin was to bring
[1:26:27] forth the body of God on Earth she was
[1:26:30] an elected lady God choose Mary and also
[1:26:34] God has chosen an elected lady which is
[1:26:39] his bride see elected I hope we are
[1:26:43] members of that tonight across the world
[1:26:49] praise the Lord are we members of that
[1:26:51] tonight
[1:26:52] can we say amen amen thank you Jesus
[1:26:58] amen God's calling to the to the elected
[1:27:02] they know it calling calling The
[1:27:04] Virtuous bride the word he see so he's
[1:27:07] bringing the bride back to the word so
[1:27:09] when you look there in Genesis chapter 1
[1:27:12] H H God expressing he's speaking his
[1:27:15] word let's let's make man in our image
[1:27:18] God created Man In His Image which image
[1:27:21] was the
[1:27:24] lust so you see the bride was in the
[1:27:27] original image of God she was also in a
[1:27:31] logos
[1:27:34] form praise the Lord the Lord now you
[1:27:37] have to realize that uh uh uh uh uh you
[1:27:42] know we we we we we in we in a society
[1:27:45] with all of this gender confusion God is
[1:27:47] not confused
[1:27:48] amen oh he's not confused
[1:27:53] praise the
[1:27:56] Lord because when God looks at gender he
[1:28:00] looks at uh uh
[1:28:04] attributes praise the
[1:28:06] Lord he looks at
[1:28:09] attributes just like I've said before
[1:28:12] all through the word all through the
[1:28:14] word nobody came out and and and design
[1:28:18] that a woman should be a preschool or
[1:28:21] kindergarten
[1:28:23] teacher nobody designed that but it's
[1:28:26] something that is done all through the
[1:28:27] world why because of that mother nature
[1:28:30] that is in
[1:28:33] her praise the Lord amen it's been
[1:28:36] proven over and over again that she will
[1:28:38] have more patient with the children than
[1:28:40] a man will
[1:28:41] have he's ready to walk out of the
[1:28:44] door two things either walk out of the
[1:28:47] door or allow them to do what they want
[1:28:49] to do you're Clos to you're close to
[1:28:52] Door kids you're just
[1:28:55] playing in time like this he just get on
[1:28:57] his cell
[1:28:58] phone and allow the kids to play and
[1:29:01] enjoy
[1:29:03] themsel a mother would not do
[1:29:06] that praise the Lord she will want to
[1:29:09] interact with them she will want to be
[1:29:11] concerned Why this one is sign what what
[1:29:13] are you crying it's in her to do it guys
[1:29:16] we don't have
[1:29:20] it praise the
[1:29:24] lord we can never come close it's God's
[1:29:28] design he gave them the ability for
[1:29:33] that he didn't give a man
[1:29:37] virtue he didn't give a man sacri you
[1:29:40] let me say it that way so you can be
[1:29:42] able to get get my touch here amen he
[1:29:45] gave it to the woman because of
[1:29:48] redemption now so we see there God call
[1:29:51] calling to the elect they know it
[1:29:54] calling The Virtuous bride the word
[1:29:56] she's the word the the the the the the
[1:29:59] last the church the elected Lady of our
[1:30:02] Lord Jesus the
[1:30:04] word if Jesus is the word how many
[1:30:08] believe that all right then the
[1:30:11] bride is always part of the bridegroom
[1:30:15] so the bride will not be a
[1:30:18] denomination it will have to be the word
[1:30:22] manifested to be the bride of Christ the
[1:30:25] word once again is going to take on
[1:30:29] flesh praise the
[1:30:31] Lord the word may
[1:30:39] flesh God borrowing your
[1:30:42] body to show that there is a
[1:30:47] Creator to show that there is a Healer
[1:30:50] God boring your body you see the thing
[1:30:53] about it there is that we have a measure
[1:30:56] so we cannot constantly live like Jesus
[1:30:59] he had the
[1:31:02] fullness so God wait for a
[1:31:06] situation praise the Lord as he keeps us
[1:31:09] in an atmosphere Keeps Us walking with
[1:31:12] the word meditating on the word he waits
[1:31:15] for the situation then the logos comes
[1:31:17] and pick up our body if there is one
[1:31:20] that is sick H and and and and and and
[1:31:22] we believe in that one we lay our hands
[1:31:25] on the promise because you are acting on
[1:31:27] the word the logos comes through your
[1:31:29] body to honor that word hallelujah
[1:31:35] amise the thing that that that that make
[1:31:38] uh uh uh uh Christians frustrated is
[1:31:41] because sometimes we think we have to be
[1:31:44] just on the housetop we have to be on
[1:31:46] the H stop praise the Lord Elijah prayed
[1:31:50] for the Ravens to bring F I'm not going
[1:31:52] to work Lord you got to you are the god
[1:31:55] of Elijah where is the god of elij you
[1:31:57] will die with with
[1:32:01] Hunger praise the Lord because in that
[1:32:05] instance you are
[1:32:14] impersonating are we together so we see
[1:32:17] here that John is looking at the elected
[1:32:21] lady that vision is affecting him and
[1:32:24] he's coming back and he gave this uh
[1:32:27] name to the church in Jo mind in Jo mind
[1:32:30] he saw the church has already
[1:32:36] arrived praise the Lord

[1:33:18] even say
[1:33:20] that if you knew what I'm going through
[1:33:22] Pastor you will not even say that for
[1:33:24] John it does not matter amen for him it
[1:33:29] does not matter he already saw the
[1:33:31] church
[1:33:32] arrive praise the
[1:33:35] Lord you got to pick yourself up yes and
[1:33:39] get to do
[1:33:41] it and kick away all of those things
[1:33:44] that are troubling you and are bothering

[1:33:47] glorious
[1:33:49] promise amen
[1:33:52] you got to get to business with
[1:33:54] God get back to the word get back to
[1:33:59] praying are we
[1:34:06] together oh glory be to
[1:34:09] God
[1:34:13] hallelujah so we see the select a lady
[1:34:16] all through now one of the places that I
[1:34:19] I would have loved to come tonight and
[1:34:21] and good that I never came there I I was
[1:34:23] going to take I was going to take uh uh
[1:34:25] Esther because
[1:34:28] Esther really display the elector there
[1:34:31] is there is lot of things there in in in
[1:34:33] in Esther you know that that another
[1:34:36] time we will pick up with this elected
[1:34:37] lady and uh uh but there's what I wanted
[1:34:41] to bring to you one was that Romans
[1:34:43] chapter 7 one so you can realize you
[1:34:46] know that it is not our old husand that
[1:34:49] is theread we are the one that is dead
[1:34:52] praise the Lord you see that's the
[1:34:54] reason why if after we have been
[1:34:57] identified with Christ if you go back to
[1:34:59] the world you are committing spiritual
[1:35:06] adultery why because in the newness of
[1:35:10] life and that is the thing that needs to
[1:35:13] come to us as a revelation we still
[1:35:16] struggle we we we we we struggle with
[1:35:19] this our old life and when I used to be
[1:35:21] this and I used to be
[1:35:25] that praise the
[1:35:27] Lord you just love your dead
[1:35:33] body you let you love your dead body
[1:35:36] because that that that that is not
[1:35:39] you if you are in Christ then you are
[1:35:43] dead to the
[1:35:46] word and that is the thing that needs to
[1:35:49] come more rear to us
[1:35:58] us and it was beautiful just just seeing
[1:36:01] that just just being able to understand
[1:36:05] that that we are the one that is there
[1:36:08] because that's what the scripture
[1:36:11] says praise the
[1:36:13] Lord so when a woman is dead the man is
[1:36:17] free to go and marry when the man is
[1:36:20] dead the woman is free to go marry but
[1:36:22] in our
[1:36:24] case since this this old serpent the
[1:36:27] devil his death is waiting at the Lake
[1:36:30] of
[1:36:32] Fire so Grace brought a newness of life
[1:36:36] to us he put us to Death In the
[1:36:39] Flesh and that is the thing that is
[1:36:41] blowing the devil's
[1:36:45] mind because he's seen you having the
[1:36:47] same expression he's seeing you you know
[1:36:50] uh the same age he seeing you the same
[1:36:53] height then he say how is this person
[1:36:56] you but what he's not seeing is that
[1:36:59] he's not seeing the Myster of God's
[1:37:01] grace that is working inside you the
[1:37:05] Myster of God's grace that is working
[1:37:07] from inside is a work from inside
[1:37:11] out that's what he's not
[1:37:13] seeing that's the reason why you don't
[1:37:16] have to look at the things around you
[1:37:18] look to
[1:37:19] yourself amen
[1:37:22] brother says look at your your motives
[1:37:24] and your
[1:37:25] objectives look at your
[1:37:29] desire praise the
[1:37:31] Lord when God came down to David what
[1:37:35] God honor was David desire to build a
[1:37:41] temple not his ability to build a
[1:37:44] temple he had the ability God say I
[1:37:47] don't want your ability I want your
[1:37:49] desire amen amen
[1:37:51] if you can get the right desire I can
[1:37:54] put my ability behind it and accomplish
[1:37:58] it because when it is your ability you
[1:38:00] going to break he want your
[1:38:04] desire so when Solomon got the right
[1:38:07] desire he said that's what I'm looking
[1:38:09] for your desire to rightly judge these
[1:38:12] people I will give you
[1:38:14] wisdom so God is looking at our
[1:38:20] desire he don't need your
[1:38:23] ability praise the Lord God do not need
[1:38:27] your
[1:38:28] ability he's the almighty God he's the
[1:38:31] all powerful God he just need that
[1:38:34] channel amen of you having the right
[1:38:39] desire Lord I want to lay for
[1:38:43] you I want to lay for
[1:38:46] you I want to
[1:38:48] surrender I want to give you my all
[1:38:52] it must not just be something here in
[1:38:54] your
[1:38:55] mind you must be able to take it from
[1:38:57] here and bring it down
[1:39:05] here the Lord bless you
[1:39:08] tonight musicians can come we we'll make
[1:39:11] a second pH of this and uh as we trust
[1:39:14] the Lord to be able to help
[1:39:20] us
[1:39:25] this is my
[1:39:27] desire we brought out the difference
[1:39:30] between
[1:39:31] Solomon and
[1:39:34] David what was David desire to D in the
[1:39:37] house of the Lord all the days of his
[1:39:39] life and to inquire in his
