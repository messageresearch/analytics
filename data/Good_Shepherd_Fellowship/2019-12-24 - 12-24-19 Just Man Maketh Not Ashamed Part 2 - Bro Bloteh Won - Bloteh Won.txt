I started asking her a question I said to her are you merciful she said yes I am it's always God so is the Lord are you kind so is the Lord are you loving so is the Lord you know and I I was just bringing out courage the reflux of the Lord and you know and I brought her back to the Garden of Eden when God created man to His image why wouldn't be like unto him when he said I have created you to my image so he put those attributes there in you to be able to believe and to be able to bring forth love mercy all those gifts that he has you have them to because you're part of him there's no way around it there's no way you can hide the world can deny it but we're part of him it's up to you to accept that you know and she looked at me and she said you know that makes sense to me you know well remember Jesus when he was contending with the Pharisees when accused him of being God and he stood there in incest and brought the scriptures he said doesn't the scripture say that your God so if we we are created as His image we are like but here's here's the here's the deal the only problem right now is that we're in a falling condition we don't have our full attributes expressing out and he had to come to give us that he had to come to give us that that was the only way we were gonna receive it but he knew who was and who was not gonna see that's the wonder overall and I'm grateful to that I'm just grateful that he called me from the foundations of the world that he called you for the Steve mr. Kelly brothers and sisters but you have to believe it you have to accept it by faith remember the story of the young or the man who went to the gallows because he deserted I know brother Brennan spoke about that and they went up to President Lincoln to get his pardon president he just took a little paper and just wrote it down just just think of it pardon so-and-so take it to him you know he took it to him and he said no I don't believe that I don't believe that in the next day simple simple how about her brothers and sisters when he was walking in Galilee [Music] the party came to you did you see it and did you accept it no wonderful it was just simple simple as that God in simplicity brother Ramsey he always comes when you never when you never expect him to and it's simple as he can come

amen let's you have a seat praise the Lord a little bit to God amen amen which they appreciate having brought Daniel and his wife of us amen praise the Lord realizing that he's flying out on Sunday evening so we asked buddy Danny to preach for us again on Sunday praise the Lord he realized that he did not finish his message I saw him for tea his notes he may praise the Lord so he could preach the rest of the 12 copies that is left praise the Lord we start Wednesday last Wednesday night speaking on just men make up matter shame and we were actually talking about from the house of shame to the house of testimony and then we try to bring Joseph into this whole situation of shame praise the Lord so he's the just man that we were talking about praise the Lord as the scripture said Joseph was a just man and as I chapter 9 verse 6 has been one of my favorite Christmas message I love to speak on their verse and since the grace of God a lot helped me to be able to see something in a verse I goes back to it over and over to remind myself around this time of the year praise the Lord Amen that the scripture says unto us a child is born and on to us a son is given praise the Lord what a promise I mean their promise hosts a whole lot of God playing of redemption it was a whole lot of what God been doing throughout all the ages and there's a lot of mystery in there brothers is a kind of a rebalance year and so I like to go back to death every time we come around this time because you know before the prophet of God taught us in and I mean what he brought out of the scripture we can help but to refer back to this all the time amen unto us a child is born and on to us a son is given it's it's pitiful that the entire religious word is kind of a stuck with the child that is born amen they are all stuck with the child that is born they remember the child that is born but a child that was born was just a vehicle to bring us the son that is giving praise the Lord the child I was born was just a vehicle to bring to us the son that is giving because it's in the son that there is life amen the child was just assisting element body like every other system element body but in their child was a son that was given and Jesus himself ins in John chapter 6 he said this let's read that together just before I get into what I want to talk about tonight praise the Lord it's in John chapter 6 and you realize you know all through Jesus ministry he talks about you know the Sun he talks about the Father he talks about the Sun and he said the son can do nothing in himself but what the father has shown him you know in order death jesus said in john chapter 6 verse 40 verse 39 he says and and this is the Father's will which have sent me that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing but she raised it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one wish see read the Son and believeth on him praise the Lord how everlasting life you realize that Jesus knew very well you know what Isaiah the prophet prophesied and there was no word in his ministry where he may reference to the child that was born but he spoke more often of the son praise the Lord because it's in the son that there was life praise the Lord it holds a great deal of the Godhead for us and it holds our representation and it holds you know Jesus said he the theory of the son amen and believe it he that is able to identify the Son and believe it on him has everlasting life and I will raise him up in the last day praise the Lord unto us a child is born a known to us a son is given praise the Lord but we just used there tonight since it's my favorite team around this time but I want to go right back into it just man that maketh nourishing praise the Lord where Branham over in God identify his character racist identified by his characteristics he said this about Joseph because now Joseph was a just man he was a good man and no doubt Mary had told him they ain't told him the visit of Gabriel and how dare she was to be overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and was to conceive and to bear a son and his name was to be called Jesus how dare she must have told that to Joseph and Joseph could look in her big brown eyes and he could see the innocent of it and he wanted to believe that he wanted to believe it with all of his heart yet it was too unusual and he was minded to put her away privily now if a man is sincere in it God will make some way to show that man that is true he's obligated if you are sincere God is obligated praise the Lord if you see it and walk away from a then you are to be judged but if you are sincere and see the truth now Joseph was was was just minded he said it's so unusual now last week we read another code where brother branham he and a mirror had just read this very promise that we read in the Book of Isaiah amen reading through the straw they have just read it nananana and and I started thinking about their today and how many times you know we we we read a promise of God and I mean right from the Word of God all from the back of the pulpit or listening to a tape and and and you can you can see the promise of God but just at the time that God would do it I mean and it's all is it's almost like Moses standing on the rock and asking God I want to see your glory pray so long amen and God who come and tell Moses I'm going to pass by but no man see me and live praise the Lord brother Branham says it's always after God has brought his word to pass it's always after he has passed that we can see his backside praise the Lord we'll be trusting God for healing in our body praise the Lord and trusting God for different things and and and and and just that moment the very moment that very meaning that God who do that thing it's always in the place where he put his hands over our eyes he brings the healing in our body or answer to our prayer then it has to take a little while for us to look back and say oh he has done it praise the Lord it's hard to catch God in the at praise the Lord amen he does it all the time before we realized that he have done it they have just read this promise in the word and they were talking about and it says so wow what a promise a virgin shall conceive and right before his eyes he knew that his wife was a virgin praise the Lord and God bring the world to pass by but Bob right before him is unusual what if the Virgin will conceive now my virgin praise the Lord and now he's he's thinking about it he believed Mary because he has trusted her praise the Lord but this is the first time for him to walk into a reality of the Word of God praise the Lord you see it is so easy for us to listening to the word all the time but when God starts to make that word flesh which is the ultimate desire of God is to make his world flesh praise the Lord and then we start thinking about I was thinking about that today you know what we we read in the stricture the Bible talks about the trial of our faith but every time trial comes it's hard for us to see right there that is the trial of our faith praise the Lord it's easier for us to read in Scripture and you know then that God loved he tried praise the Lord we read there we can say Amen to the Word of God praise the Lord we can be thinking about it preparing ourself for the triumph but when the Trier comes on the scene it looks like we have a flat tire yet tonight praise the Lord glory be to God Amen we have to know that God ultimate desire is to make his word flesh in us praise the Lord God is not satisfied of how much a brand-new Bible you carry he now satisfied of how many times you read the Bible in the day and what his desire is is for His Word to be made flesh in you and myself praise the Lord he told Moses build me a tabernacle I want to come down and dwell with my people praise the Lord amen so later Joseph year thinking about this how could this be man I mean we got into the drama of their last week and I mean every newspaper Karen earring you know what everybody comes to Jacob workshop that's what I want to talk about and I mean he was just he was just caught between the mountains and the Red Sea praise the Lord but as the scripture said he was a just man he was not going to make a public short about this amen and as he was thinking it in his heart the Bible says and that night the very same angel came together I mean came the angel Gabriel came to Joseph and told him there this thing is done by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and I believe when when Joseph woke up that day he was ready to bear the reproach of the word praise the Lord now this is the greatest gift the Sun that is giving it's in the Sun that there escape this is God's own life praise the Lord the Bible says and God made man in His image and breath into man and he became a living soul brother Branham says he was an amateur God praise the Lord the Bible says and God made man and then he rested praise the Lord wish of course we know that it was not just a natural rest or taking a nap it was God dwelling in his son it was God taking a form of the very man that he has created it was God homely himself to the body that he has made praise the Lord that God would trust his work to the hands of his own creature praise the Lord Amen he birthed in two men he man became a living soul that was the breath of God God's own life oh yeah he had to have a son in his image he had to have a man to protect the things that he have created Adam was put in a garden as an amateur god amen he had a work to name all the animals in and I mean he was he was there as as a protection to the work of God to everything that God made he was he was having dominion over it praise the Lord this is to say 2:19 and that's what we were going last week when God gave His Word God raised of men to protect that word praise the Lord this Psalm that was going to be giving God was more interested in the Sun than the child amen because the Sun was gift just like Jesus said to the woman at the word if you know he won't to have spoken unto you that was the gift of God that was the gift of life for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son praise the Lord that God would trust you and myself praise the Lord just like Paul said to make us steel walls of his mystery to make a steel wall of his life in God's mind he knew it was going to be married and he never allowed her to fall in love with any kind of a novice just a young boy praise the Lord they have his his feet on his shoulders praise the Lord and this Joseph was a widow all his wife passed away he has been there just like I said you have raised children he know what it is God got a man seizing that's why he had to bring us through seven Church ages because he wanted people seasoned mentor and people that can take the reproach of the world now goals that would back away when they start talking about the crime out dog that we back away when people can find one foot or another fun trace the Lord I just meant making that a shame when just have got a witness it was Ned a passed down experience the angel visited to him that night the angel spoke to his heart praise the Lord amen and with that experience he was willing to take the reproach he was willing to protect that life that is amazing that brother Branham says something here in physical union we've been clean that through the tens giving weekend and I read that all the time he says now I'm speaking now bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church stands I'm not speaking of you women but I'm speaking of the church and Christ now this she is giving to brave for life their only God amen that only God can give praise alone this she is giving to bring for life and when a God Himself can give her Hosmer might be the gem bear but God has to produce the life all life comes from God and her life has to comes from God praise the Lord he says now she has sacred one I want to name three things here that she must net get away from praise the Lord I'm I'm speaking keep the church in mind what I'm speaking this to the natural woman praise the Lord we went over this praise Lord that is a stranger as we as you follow me a little bit and see how brother Branham tied this thing right in to Joseph and Mary's life amen so just like the proper God says she was giving these things for redemption praise the Lord and that was the thing that Adam was supposed to protect that is the thing that a man's supposed to protect because sons and daughters of God people that God will use India generation will be born by parents the scripture said train up a child in a way that will grow then when they get all they will not depart from it praise the Lord and then we have our children just like the little one we dedicate tonight lovely little baby but God has a purpose God has a gift in the life of that little baby praise the Lord so as a parent we have the responsibility to be able to guide that little life to protect it just like how Joseph had a responsibility to protect Mary and that's what he was raised up for just imagine everything he went through in his life he had his first wife he had training where his first five praise the Lord he loved her to death his children he did every but God was preparing him to be a protector praise the Lord so that gift that was coming in would praise Lord realized the religious world was against it Herod the King was against it so the religious world was against it the political world was against it praise the Lord and the people was so busy during their time of taxation that there was no even no room praise the Lord so Joseph was now only facing their religious word the Pharisees or Sadducees or the Sanhedrin Council there was a word also from Herod the King to get the child praise the Lord as he was travelling everywhere I was so busy there was no room in a name he had to be with the the the economy of that day so the political system the religious system the economic system everything was against their word but he was raising up God rose him up God trained him by all the trials that he went through everything that he went through and he thought it was just his natural life God trained him to bring him to that moment because the gift of life the body that God has prepared to come among men to become flesh was giving and he to protect it praise the Lord and that's the same responsibility we have been giving praise the Lord this salvation is gospel life this grace that we have received is God's own life he has brought us in all of our ways of life in everything that we went through just for this movie praise the Lord just for this moment when the entire verse system is against this we know everything that is building up in politics and everything that is building up in a religious word and even the economy of the word it's all coming against this life of Christ praise the Lord and God raised up Joseph for this very reason let's read a little bit yeah better Branham continuing he speaks of four years in the seventh chapter of Romans she has a sacred trust or virtue committed to her by God nothing s horse it bought the woman praise the Lord just the same as the church that there has been married to the Lord has to come also before Christ before the second marriage as she she has to confess there if she she doesn't and she lay with her husband even ten years and then confess it she has a right to be put away that's the scripture fornication is on clean living now he brings Joseph into the story Joseph fear ner to take on today married a wife for that which is conceived in her praise the Lord now you read the Old Testament and many people who think that the Old Testament was so hard on women praise the Lord and that's how they will look at it why why did God place it like that is because she had this sacred trust in her it was not that the Old Testament were hard and we mean the law was protecting the gift of life because God will has to come true the blustering brother Branham says in the Old Testament he had to purify the blood strain here there was no mix of blood because Almighty God was going to ride through the blood stream to become flesh so he'll a it can in his household had to be burned and and I mean everything that was like like a mix go we have to cut it off he was protecting that bloodstream and that is the same thing the woman was in a type of praise the Lord because she was said to be protecting where Branham says she was to bring forth life the only thing that God Himself can gave praise the Lord because she was to be the life giver where Benham go ahead he says and because she was cast over the other side she has also been given the sacred trash from God for redemption the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the setting so God gave her the promise of redemption the sacred trust of it was because the Redeemer was going to come true so she needed to be protected praise the Lord Peter come up and he caused a woman a weaker vessel Paul guess alone and he says God has poured heaven a treasure in empty vessel and all of those things I play out all through the scripture through the life and ministry of Jeremiah and all the different ones praise the Lord that God will put his antenna plane in our broken lives amen our broken lives in and in all of our mistakes and and in all of the trials and trouble that we would go through but down in that soul that's a gem of life God's own life praise the Lord and that's the reason why in every age God will raise up a man and he would give him a word you would give him a mini strength praise the Lord and that ministry will be there to guide the way to the Tree of Life that ministry will be there to be able to guide to protect that life that God has ordained for that age praise the Lord Joseph had to protect Mary and that's the reason why it's in a marriage covenant that's the work of the man he's there to protect his wife because marriage is a mystery praise the Lord it's a mystery and God only gave this responsibility to just man amen we know just men and that men that don't have mistakes praise the Lord just men are earnest men just men a man that can own up to their mistakes praise the Lord I believe if the scripture if you please go to put in the scripture that Joseph was thinking to put married away probably the Word of God expose reveal his heart and I believe that Joseph was earnest about it to tell Mary what he was thinking if God who revealed in his word it was not difficult for him to talk about it praise the Lord amen that's a just man he's an earnest man this is this is where I was I was confused but it took God to come down and dissolve my doubts just man I met I'm not ashamed when they are struggling I mean the another team when they are struggling to admit that I'm strongly I need help or God I believe that's the place where Joseph was he was saying all God I need help you know I love Mary with all of my heart I need help and when you cry to God for help like that help is on its way God will surely give you help praise the Lord oh just man I'm not ashamed when when the field to admit that they have failed just men are now seamless man no just men are now seamless me just many men that makes mistake but the owner to their mistakes they admit when they are wrong and they ask for help when they need help praise the Lord barber says Joseph was sincere amen he said he wasn't here because this was unusual praise the Lord trials are unusual that's the reason why when a hit or we get confused and the first thing we start to check our life were where we where we have seen it and what has gone wrong and in law what I've had done and and it's hard for us in the first instant to say thank you Lord for the tribe yeah praise the Lord amen if you ever did that you made that up praise the Lord God use these tries to build characters for just me praise the Lord just imagine Joseph wept over the passing of his wife it took him a while for him to get over it to be able to trust another woman with his heart and just in that time prison water it takes heart rires to prepare us to be just man in situations to stand with this world to stand for Christ in a situation praise the Lord young people that's what God is looking for he's looking for just men just men make it nourishing he stood with Mary he better approach praise the Lord he was ready to defend her I believe there were time were they were angry religious crowd ready to stone her to death and Joseph would say over my dead body I have to be there first praise the Lord one time there was a just man that a woman in that daughter rental amen the Cora in a daughter she rented that just man he looked him in the eyes and he said which one him own you have not seen praise the Lord it takes a just man to make those balls take me glory be to God I believe that's the hour we are in church as we go through this season of Christmas and you know we think about the gift of life that was giving but also think about the protection that God has put around this he has given us five for ministry to protect this world he has given us nine spiritual gift to protect this world he has even given us seven angels seven angels just to protect this world not sure how sacred God word is they mean they're sure that is not is not from a Bible School it's not just at geological reasoning is God's own life praise the Lord it's God's own life just imagine when when irony either fell he placed two cherubim to guide the Tree of Life amen because that was representing his life God always protect his life his protection his mercy His grace his angels that he gave in charge of us is not just because of this body is because we are carrying his life and that's the thing I want for us too to be able to draw from this amen where Brennan says is not the man that comes predestinated it's the seed is the word praise the Lord amen without the word without the promise of God for this age predestination is just a dictionary word God never predestinated flesh he predestinated his word he predestinated his promise so is that word that he's obligated to is that word that he's protected praise the Lord I was talking to her brother just yesterday yes we're just talking on some things and trying to encourage him with different things they are dealing with and I told him Isis Isis Isis bro you think about this you and myself we grew in the same neighborhood but I never knew you the thing that makes us to know one another is this word pressure law and the thing that would make us not to know one another is this word praise the Lord Amen praise the Lord is that Ida ban our hearts in Christian love we must cherish the word we can fight for our personality it's nothing what we fight for is the word what we try to defend is the word what we try to uphold is the word that's the reason why no one is above this word praise the Lord even Almighty God subject himself to his word praise the Lord the word is our absolute the word is our object of worship Amen that's the object that we are worshiping is the word we are appreciating his word we are adoring his word in our hearts and as we do there we are conforming to his word let's not play with the word let's not compromise on the word praise the Lord because that's the thing we are called to protect just like Joseph praise the Lord I believe when the angel spoke to him that night and he work off his attitude change the way he was going about thing changed completely if he had a swirled he went his shopping his walk glory be to God he could travel stay with Mary whether the parents believe it or not he was there with her because Almighty God told him this thing that is fallen in her is of the Holy Ghost we will realize that the life that each and every one of us is carrying is of the Holy Ghost when we are born again when we receive the Holy Ghost it's not a church life just man that make it not a sheep God or so much interesting to make us just like is st. Anne danger so Gabriel he sent you and myself seven angels to witness to this world we don't need to be a shame of faith we might not be able to explain everything but when this word is real to your heart you can be a shame of it praise the Lord because this is the very word that is going to change our body this word is our life and we don't need to be a shame of it praise the Lord let's protect the word in in our children let's protect the word in our life in our home let's protect the word that's what God has raising us up in this our form it's to stand for that word as a religious world go around you know and they all into the child that is born but we have seen the son amen we have seen the son and not only that we have seen it we have received a son and we're ready to stand with the son musicians you can come out tonight when he eyes so open Burberry since 1964 he says now it was unusual when Joseph before the birth when he found Mary is lovely little sweetheart that he was engaged to be married he found her she was to be mother without being married so she no doubt had told him that she was visited by the angel and Joseph was a just man he was a good man he wanted to believe her he could imagine that he loved all love her with all her or his heart seeing their young Hebrew man and looking into her eyes and when she said Joseph dear the great danger Gabe revisited meaning he said I will be overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and the Holy thing that will be born in me Oh being for me mean will be called the son of God [Music] now he wanted to believe there but there have never been anything happening like that so it was too unusual and look there was a just man a good man and the scripture claiming that it will be the Virgin who conceived and he didn't understand praise the Lord see the scripture said that Christ would be born that way still just have pudding understand it because it was too unusual now in them days there was no prophet they hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years and so God dared with him in dream praise the Lord a dream is a secondary way the right way is always true the world first praise the Lord the right way is true the word first that's the highest way that God can speak to us it's true his word be it on to me according to your word [Music] even though in the time of trials and in a time of unusual situation is hard for us to see that it is God but you know them when we when we confess like married they'd be it unto me that call into your word God don't get worried he never worries what are you are used to it or net praise the Lord but he looks at their heart that his constant is her running to his will they'll all be alone to me just according to your world I may not understand it praise the Lord well I just surrounded myself to your will and to your word whatever your word has promised whatever grace has placed in my path give me grace [Music] because whatever God is allowing to happy in our life he's
