[13:05] Lord
[13:07] that the first things you would hear
[13:10] from our hearts and our lips this
[13:12] evening wouldn't be
[13:14] Lord just us
[13:16] putting our list of wants and desires
[13:18] out before you but just taking a moment
[13:21] to give you praise
[13:23] give you thanks father
[13:25] for all the things you've already done
[13:27] for us father
[13:29] for all the blessings you already
[13:31] blessed us with father
[13:33] Lord it said that if the only thing we

[14:09] that we woke up with any amount of
[14:10] Health father Lord that

[14:19] Lord because we know you're in control
[14:21] father Lord all the things that we are
[14:25] get so concerned about and we worry and
[14:28] stew about father if we would just look
[14:30] at the bigger picture father
[14:32] and look at how you have kept us in our
[14:35] lives father Lord all that worry would
[14:38] slip right away and we could start
[14:40] praising you immediately father knowing
[14:43] that if you brought us this far
[14:45] Lord It's Only Our doubt and unbelief
[14:48] that is keeping us from

[14:54] you don't bring us this far to leave us
[14:57] father
[14:58] Lord and we can rest in that knowing

[41:32] it wouldn't make any difference in the
[41:34] sight of God
[41:36] and I'm happy to see you all here
[41:39] and um Danny's birthday was yesterday
[41:42] actually
[41:44] Sunday morning he was here to give a
[41:46] testimony
[41:48] and uh it's just a miracle
[41:50] that he is alive
[41:53] yeah because I believe it was not once
[41:57] I believe it was more than once
[42:00] he passed out
[42:01] uh one time I think probably that I was
[42:04] the last one or the first one
[42:06] he was in a bus
[42:09] everybody alighted
[42:11] the bus driver went round and went round
[42:13] and went round
[42:14] and it was time for him to go and Park
[42:17] and there was one guy behind the bus who
[42:19] will never get down
[42:21] so he stopped that bus came to him
[42:24] tried to talk to him and he wasn't even
[42:27] there
[42:28] they had to call the police to come and
[42:30] get him and carry him to the hospital
[42:33] that was what drugs drugs was trying to
[42:36] finish him
[42:38] is just a miracle that he's here
[42:41] praise be to God
[42:43] I remember not quite it's not three
[42:46] years probably two and a half years now
[42:49] it was his birthday
[42:51] and uh we called at the time they were
[42:54] with the uh with their auntie and then
[42:57] we called to wish him a happy birthday
[43:00] and then
[43:01] I said Danny boy you're growing
[43:04] and then he left
[43:07] he said Daddy I'm growing well without
[43:09] wisdom
[43:15] so I laughed may his mother asked what
[43:18] is he saying I said your son says he's
[43:20] growing without wisdom
[43:24] so he said daddy do you remember in our
[43:26] morning devotion one time
[43:29] you said Jesus grew in stature and in
[43:32] wisdom
[43:33] I am growing in stature I'm not growing
[43:35] in wisdom
[43:39] praise be to God
[43:41] that is another thing we can talk about
[43:43] tonight
[43:45] about growth
[43:47] in every aspect
[43:49] one doesn't go without the other praise
[43:52] be to God
[43:53] it's just the grace of God
[43:56] and I remember
[43:58] you know they need my wife talking to
[44:00] Joshua he said it was because of you
[44:03] guys who went and bought house all that
[44:06] way
[44:07] so probably it's time to go back to
[44:09] Brooklyn Park
[44:12] and Joshua told his mother not even in
[44:15] Brooklyn Park
[44:16] but we can even go into the to the heart
[44:19] of Minneapolis
[44:20] our silver Christians
[44:23] praise be to God
[44:25] it's just wonderful and amazing What the
[44:28] Lord Has Done
[44:29] and I would just want to thank God
[44:32] you know for the lives of these children
[44:34] and every one of you all your prayers
[44:38] one thing I know our prayers will never
[44:40] go in vain
[44:42] praise be to God
[44:45] yes
[44:47] so tonight
[44:49] when I dropped my wife off to work I
[44:52] went back home
[44:53] I just went on my knees and prayed
[44:56] and I woke up
[44:59] and um just decided to you know a few
[45:02] things that came to me I wrote it down
[45:05] and I'm trusting and believing
[45:09] that
[45:10] God will just come
[45:12] in the Simplicity of his word and speak
[45:15] to every need there is in the house
[45:17] tonight
[45:18] praise be to God
[45:21] um
[45:22] shall we just stand and turn our Bibles
[45:26] to Isaiah 9.
[45:29] six
[45:36] Isaiah 9 6.
[45:50] okay so I read
[45:54] For unto us a child is born
[45:57] and to us a son is given
[46:00] and the government shall be upon his
[46:02] shoulder
[46:03] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[46:06] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[46:10] father the Prince of Peace
[46:12] verse 7.
[46:14] of the increase of his government and
[46:16] peace
[46:18] there shall be no end
[46:20] upon the throne of David
[46:22] and upon his kingdom to order it and to
[46:25] establish it with judgment and with
[46:28] Justice from henceforth even forever
[46:32] the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[46:36] perform this
[46:37] praise be to God
[46:39] should we turn shall we tend to Luke 3.
[46:56] Luke 3 16.
[47:05] John and that saying
[47:07] unto them all I indeed baptize you with
[47:12] water
[47:13] but one mightier than I cometh
[47:16] the legend of whose shoes I am not
[47:19] worthy to unloose he shall baptize you
[47:22] with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[47:26] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[47:28] reading of his word
[47:30] shall we be seated
[47:33] praise the Lord
[47:35] I know when I read Isaiah probably you
[47:37] guys thought
[47:39] you know a lot of our Chris Christmas
[47:42] messages are taken from this
[47:45] and I know say brother Christmas is over
[47:49] even Easter is over what are we reading
[47:52] praise be to God we are going to go in a
[47:55] different direction this uh tonight
[47:57] uh trusting God to help us
[48:01] when brother Jordan prayed
[48:04] it was like
[48:06] you know just taking certain things out
[48:09] of what I am going to talk about tonight
[48:14] he said
[48:16] we don't want to come asking
[48:20] but to give you the glory
[48:24] and then just to praise him to bless him
[48:28] for what he has already done for us
[48:31] I don't know about you
[48:34] but as a matter of fact
[48:37] if the law does not do anything
[48:41] for me
[48:42] again is enough
[48:47] because he has already done more than
[48:49] enough
[48:51] there is nothing I can think of which
[48:53] the Lord has not done
[48:56] when I pray I ask I do
[49:01] but as a matter of fact if the Lord
[49:04] should not do anything if he does not do
[49:06] anything
[49:07] I also praise His holy name
[49:10] because he has done more than enough
[49:13] the most important thing about life
[49:16] human life which is your personal
[49:18] salvation
[49:20] he has given it to me
[49:23] it doesn't matter what comes and what
[49:25] goes
[49:27] that is beside the point
[49:31] whether I go barefooted
[49:36] whether I go without food
[49:39] whatever condition it is that I find
[49:41] myself in I will say praise God
[49:45] because the Lord our God is more than
[49:48] evil
[49:50] and it just ties in
[49:53] the prayer ties into what I'm going to
[49:55] talk about tonight
[49:57] praise be to God
[50:00] the title of my message
[50:04] is
[50:06] our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:08] is the greatest
[50:12] just to praise His holy name tonight
[50:16] there was a story
[50:19] about
[50:21] a Christian lady in Nigeria
[50:25] it happened in the Northwestern part of
[50:28] Nigeria
[50:30] that was somewhere last year
[50:33] now
[50:35] she just graduated from school
[50:39] and she passed her exams
[50:42] and she was happy
[50:44] that she passed her exams
[50:47] and she went on social media
[50:50] her colleagues were just posting things
[50:52] on social media
[50:53] and she also posted it
[50:57] that Jesus is the greatest
[51:03] and guess what
[51:06] the Muslims in the school
[51:09] who were her own classmates
[51:12] who had known her all those years
[51:15] said she blasphemed
[51:18] against their prophet
[51:21] and they were looking for her to kill
[51:24] and she ran and one of this the the the
[51:27] tutors hid her in her room
[51:30] and when they realized she was there
[51:32] they went in for her
[51:35] and they dragged her out
[51:37] and the stone her to death
[51:41] and then they set her body on fire
[51:44] and took pictures of it
[51:47] in fact
[51:50] you know
[51:52] when I was just thinking about it
[51:57] elsewhere people do not have the freedom
[52:00] we have in America here
[52:02] and we take it for granted
[52:05] that we can Worship the Lord Our God any
[52:08] time of day
[52:10] we can stand in the streets and shout
[52:13] and praise God
[52:15] the worst that would happen is that
[52:17] somebody will call the police
[52:19] and said there's somebody behind my
[52:21] window disturbing me and the police will
[52:23] come and ask you to go as he's going to
[52:26] arrest you that is the worst that can
[52:28] happen
[52:28] but there are places elsewhere in the
[52:31] world why people hide
[52:34] to save God
[52:36] why people do not have the same Freedom
[52:39] we have
[52:42] good and we have so much taking things
[52:46] for granted
[52:49] till we don't even know
[52:54] what we are missing
[52:58] because she said
[53:00] Jesus is the greatest
[53:06] they had to take away her life in a very
[53:09] gruesome manner
[53:14] and tonight
[53:16] I just want to talk about our lord Jesus
[53:20] is the greatest
[53:23] praise be to God
[53:25] in the message
[53:29] the Good Shepherd of the Sheep
[53:31] 1957.
[53:35] brother says I don't believe there is
[53:39] any
[53:40] greater thing
[53:43] that we could talk about tonight
[53:47] Dan would be the Lord Jesus
[53:51] he is the greatest person
[53:54] that we could talk about
[53:57] and I just love to talk and brag about
[53:59] him
[54:02] because he is ready
[54:05] of all things
[54:07] that anyone could say
[54:10] I have never found in any voice yet
[54:15] or in my thinking
[54:17] anyways
[54:19] that could ever express my gratitude to
[54:23] him for all that he has done for me and
[54:26] for others
[54:27] praise be to God
[54:29] that he has not found yet
[54:33] any voice
[54:36] and in his thinking he has not found
[54:38] anywhere
[54:39] to express
[54:41] his gratitude to the almighty God
[54:46] is that not a situation in which you
[54:48] find ourselves
[54:50] there are simply no ways
[54:54] now when you think of those words we use
[54:57] when we are praising God
[54:59] wonderful counselor Mighty God Prince of
[55:03] Peace Everlasting father when you think
[55:06] of those words we thank you we bless you
[55:09] we uplift you we glorify thee you are an
[55:11] awesome God you think of all those ways
[55:15] yes there is something in you that so
[55:17] tells you
[55:19] that you have not done Justice yet
[55:24] there are no words simply no worse
[55:28] to express our gratitude
[55:32] to his goodness and for the love he has
[55:34] for us
[55:37] and it just gives me the feeling
[55:40] that here on Earth it doesn't matter how
[55:43] much we praise him we can never hit that
[55:46] Mark until we get there
[55:50] praise be to God
[55:52] and I'm here tonight
[55:55] to brag about him
[55:58] it's not going to be a long service
[56:01] I'm just here to brag about him he is
[56:04] the greatest
[56:05] there is not like unto him
[56:09] he created the heavens and yet
[56:11] by his word
[56:14] there is power he is the almighty God
[56:18] he chose to become a man for our sake
[56:22] can you imagine
[56:24] if God had not come
[56:27] to Bear our sins and to carry them to
[56:31] the cross
[56:32] why would you and I be tonight
[56:35] where would we be
[56:37] he is the greatest
[56:41] he bore our sins
[56:44] he took our shame
[56:46] he died in our place
[56:49] he took the judgment
[56:51] he becomes sin who do you know sin that
[56:55] we should become the very righteousness
[56:56] of God
[56:58] he gave us all for you and me
[57:01] till brother brother says that he has no
[57:03] legs but our legs
[57:05] he has no hands but our hands
[57:08] praise be to God
[57:10] all that he is
[57:12] he gave it for us
[57:15] of all people we ought to be the most
[57:19] grateful
[57:21] praise be to God
[57:24] he came unto this Earth and he taught
[57:26] men in his ways
[57:29] we were born in sin
[57:31] and were shaped in iniquity
[57:34] we lived in sin
[57:38] and all about this were nothing but evil
[57:43] and sometimes for some of us
[57:48] our lives were so evil and so thinking
[57:54] that men of good morals
[57:57] were even ashamed to identify themselves
[58:00] with us
[58:03] but the almighty God
[58:06] the Lord of loss the king of kings
[58:10] the one and only Holy One there is and
[58:14] the one and only Hollywood that would
[58:16] ever be
[58:17] in his holiness
[58:19] in his Purity in his righteousness he
[58:23] chose to identify himself
[58:25] with our filth and with our evil
[58:28] condition
[58:30] praise be to God
[58:33] I'm just here to brag about the Lord
[58:35] tonight
[58:38] praise the Lord
[58:41] that there is not like unto him
[58:44] our lives were so out of place
[58:48] so useless
[58:50] so shattered
[58:52] that they had no use
[58:57] simply no use
[59:03] but in the hands of the almighty God
[59:07] our lives were useful
[59:15] Once Upon a Time in the Bible
[59:18] amen by name Simon Simon the Pharisee
[59:22] invited the Lord Jesus Christ to his
[59:25] house
[59:26] to come and have dinner with them and
[59:29] you already know
[59:30] that the Pharisees
[59:33] and the Lord Jesus did not have anything
[59:35] in common
[59:38] and a Pharisee was inviting him into his
[59:42] house
[59:44] and you already know
[59:46] that there was something under his lips
[59:48] and it was not anything good
[59:52] now the Lord Jesus Christ already knew
[59:57] what he was going to face there
[1:00:00] but that did not stop you from going
[1:00:03] and brother brothers says anywhere he is
[1:00:06] invited he goes
[1:00:08] and that he keeps his appointments
[1:00:11] hey can you imagine I'm just thinking
[1:00:13] about it
[1:00:15] that if Simon the Pharisee called him
[1:00:18] after he had gathered his colleagues
[1:00:20] just to make fun of him and he knew
[1:00:23] about it and he went anyhow how would
[1:00:26] you and I invite when he would not come
[1:00:30] that he knows that he is coming to
[1:00:33] receive praise
[1:00:34] that he knows he's been invited to come
[1:00:36] and receive honor
[1:00:38] and you think he would not come
[1:00:40] he is going to show up anyhow
[1:00:45] it reminds me of a story of her sister
[1:00:52] she knew
[1:00:54] and then one time
[1:00:56] she just
[1:00:57] prayed and said father I have heard a
[1:01:01] lot about you but I want to see you
[1:01:05] and that she went prepared food
[1:01:10] and then she said the table
[1:01:14] and then she was waiting
[1:01:19] then somebody came and knocked at the
[1:01:21] door
[1:01:22] and then she just jumped on her feet and
[1:01:25] went to the door lo and behold when she
[1:01:28] got to the door there was a man at the
[1:01:30] door that was dressed unkempt
[1:01:35] he was not in the right clothing
[1:01:38] he was not wearing the right hair
[1:01:41] he was not looking very good
[1:01:44] and then she stood open the door halfway
[1:01:47] yes can I help you and the man said I
[1:01:50] need some water to drink please
[1:01:52] and then the sister goes into the room
[1:01:56] and then she takes a cup
[1:01:58] it was not the most decent cup in the
[1:02:01] house
[1:02:03] but it was clean
[1:02:05] she went got water came and gave it to
[1:02:09] this man the man drunk said thank you
[1:02:12] God bless you
[1:02:14] and then she took the cup
[1:02:17] she waited and waited and waited till it
[1:02:20] was night
[1:02:21] and then she went to bed and prayed as a
[1:02:24] father I said the table I waited for you
[1:02:26] never showed up
[1:02:28] and then she went to bed and then she
[1:02:30] had a dream
[1:02:32] that she saw the Lord Jesus
[1:02:35] and then she was asking him why is it
[1:02:38] that I set the table and you didn't show
[1:02:41] up he said but I came
[1:02:44] I came and knocked at the door
[1:02:46] but you didn't receive me
[1:02:49] I asked for water to drink you didn't
[1:02:51] even give me the best of cups
[1:02:55] and they're in the dream
[1:02:57] she started whipping
[1:03:02] the Bible says
[1:03:04] that we should do good
[1:03:08] don't do good because you are expecting
[1:03:11] something in return
[1:03:13] don't show kindness because you are
[1:03:16] expecting something in return
[1:03:18] be kind and be good because that is what
[1:03:21] you are supposed to do as a child of God
[1:03:27] it doesn't matter who shows up
[1:03:30] he prayed the Lord came
[1:03:33] but in her mind she had a picture of how
[1:03:37] he should look like
[1:03:42] anyway you invite him he goes
[1:03:46] if you ever invite him be sure you show
[1:03:50] up
[1:03:55] and then he goes to someone the
[1:03:56] Pharisees house
[1:03:58] and then he sits down
[1:04:01] and it was the custom
[1:04:03] that you get to as your neighbor's place
[1:04:07] they have to wash your feet and Nod your
[1:04:10] head with oil give you a kiss it shows
[1:04:12] that you are welcomed
[1:04:14] but when he came wherever he sat that
[1:04:17] was it they were just sitting down
[1:04:20] and then looking at him
[1:04:22] how many they are fun
[1:04:24] probably talking evil about him
[1:04:27] and he was just sitting down
[1:04:29] sitting down
[1:04:32] and here comes a woman
[1:04:36] and then stands behind it
[1:04:39] just looking at the scene
[1:04:41] and she says no something is not right
[1:04:44] something is not right is this not a
[1:04:46] prophet
[1:04:48] oh this looks like him
[1:04:52] he is the one
[1:04:54] no
[1:04:56] I must do something about this
[1:04:59] and the Bible says she was a woman that
[1:05:02] was living off her body
[1:05:06] she was a prostitute
[1:05:09] and she said I must do something about
[1:05:10] this
[1:05:11] and then she ran to the house one day
[1:05:14] took her pants counted all the money she
[1:05:16] had
[1:05:17] she said you know what I need to do
[1:05:19] something about this she went out there
[1:05:22] running
[1:05:23] she got a place
[1:05:26] she bought she wanted to buy oil
[1:05:29] she said no
[1:05:30] this is the prophet of God
[1:05:34] she would know
[1:05:35] where this money is coming from
[1:05:38] this is not a good thing to do
[1:05:41] no I can't do this
[1:05:43] so say no but I have to do it
[1:05:48] well brother says that if a if if there
[1:05:51] is anything you want to do for God God
[1:05:54] will never stop you
[1:05:56] he will give you the chance to do it
[1:05:59] a lot of the times we come in our own
[1:06:02] way
[1:06:03] we become our own obstacles and we give
[1:06:06] reasons and excuses why we are not doing
[1:06:09] it
[1:06:12] praise the Lord
[1:06:14] and she bought this Alabaster oil
[1:06:17] and she run good day
[1:06:20] she went and stood
[1:06:22] who knows Emilio thoughts running in her
[1:06:25] mind
[1:06:25] he is the prophet of God he knows where
[1:06:28] I got this money to buy this thing from
[1:06:30] would he accept it
[1:06:32] something says don't go sometimes I'm
[1:06:34] going anyhow
[1:06:35] she just stood there and as she was
[1:06:38] standing behind him
[1:06:40] I mean she just got so broken
[1:06:45] she was the woman that was living in sin
[1:06:50] she what got so broken
[1:06:52] started whipping and then she just went
[1:06:55] before him probably looked in his eyes
[1:06:58] to see if he was going to be rejected
[1:07:02] and she saw nothing but smiles and a
[1:07:06] very welcoming attitude
[1:07:08] and then she came closer went on her
[1:07:11] knees
[1:07:12] started weeping started weeping the
[1:07:15] tears were just coming she was washing
[1:07:18] his feet with her tears washing his feet
[1:07:21] wiping it with her hair
[1:07:23] and when she had gone through took the
[1:07:26] alabaster ointment looked in his eyes
[1:07:29] whether there was any sense of rejection
[1:07:31] she saw nothing but love she held the
[1:07:35] oil probably trying to open it and she
[1:07:37] has was shaking would he accept this she
[1:07:40] knows where this thing is coming from
[1:07:42] just trying to open it until she open it
[1:07:46] just anointed his feet he was just
[1:07:49] looking at her anointed his feet and he
[1:07:53] assessed the Pharisees he said this man
[1:07:57] is he really a prophet
[1:07:59] if he was a prophet he would know who
[1:08:02] this woman is because this woman is
[1:08:05] known all over the city
[1:08:08] and here this woman is just sitting down
[1:08:10] anointing his feet and he's sitting
[1:08:12] there looking at her
[1:08:14] and then he called Simon Says Simon I
[1:08:18] have something to
[1:08:20] him to start ahead
[1:08:23] a house
[1:08:24] you didn't even welcome me
[1:08:27] now I want to ask you
[1:08:29] there were two debtors
[1:08:31] he gave him a very short story
[1:08:35] one old five pence
[1:08:38] the other old 50 pence
[1:08:41] and they didn't have the money to pay
[1:08:45] and the person from whom they borrowed
[1:08:47] this money forgive them yeah
[1:08:50] of the two people
[1:08:52] who do you think
[1:08:54] would be more grateful
[1:08:56] he said I suppose the one to whom most
[1:09:00] was forgiven he said yes you have said
[1:09:02] the right thing
[1:09:05] I came to your house
[1:09:07] you didn't welcome me
[1:09:10] you didn't wash my feet you didn't give
[1:09:12] me a kiss you didn't anoint my head
[1:09:16] you disregarded me
[1:09:18] by this lady here
[1:09:21] from that time she started washing my
[1:09:23] feet and anointing it she has never
[1:09:25] stopped
[1:09:27] and even though her sins are many has
[1:09:30] since I've forgiven her
[1:09:32] praise be to God and they said who is
[1:09:35] this man That Forgives sins
[1:09:38] her sins are forgiving her
[1:09:44] there is no sin
[1:09:46] that is too big
[1:09:48] that it cannot be forgiven
[1:09:52] you can be can be a waste of sinners
[1:09:57] there is enough Power in the Blood of
[1:10:00] the Lord Jesus Christ to forgive you and
[1:10:02] to cleanse you
[1:10:06] has shattered life
[1:10:10] her life that were was shattered and
[1:10:12] broken Beyond repair
[1:10:15] has now been restored
[1:10:20] I don't know about you
[1:10:22] but I can look at my personal life
[1:10:25] and I can say without missing words
[1:10:28] that if it hadn't been for the sake of
[1:10:30] God
[1:10:31] oh my goodness
[1:10:34] my love would have been very very
[1:10:36] terrible
[1:10:38] I want the forests
[1:10:41] till I couldn't go any further
[1:10:44] it took the hand of God
[1:10:46] to bring me back
[1:10:48] it is the grace of God that has restored
[1:10:51] every one of us
[1:10:53] it is not our wisdom it is not our
[1:10:55] strength
[1:10:56] it is not a reality we are able to do it
[1:10:59] is what he has done and that is what we
[1:11:02] are depending on tonight
[1:11:04] if there is anybody we ought to be
[1:11:07] grateful of if there is anybody we ought
[1:11:10] to be proud of if there is anybody we
[1:11:13] ought to brag about it's nobody else by
[1:11:15] the Lord Jesus
[1:11:21] is
[1:11:22] our Lord
[1:11:24] and our personal savior
[1:11:28] praise be to God
[1:11:43] so the world
[1:11:48] the world is not a friend to the truth
[1:12:00] how can someone
[1:12:03] who is speaking the truth
[1:12:06] be giving such a raw Justice
[1:12:11] but that doesn't come to us by surprise
[1:12:15] John the Baptist
[1:12:17] was beheaded
[1:12:19] for speaking the truth
[1:12:23] the Lord Jesus was crucified for the
[1:12:26] truth
[1:12:29] ah through the years and All Through the
[1:12:31] Ages
[1:12:33] children of God
[1:12:35] we can talk about the Matthias of the
[1:12:38] Lord Jesus people that were crucified
[1:12:40] not because they committed in a crime
[1:12:44] but for believing the gospel
[1:12:48] praise be to God
[1:12:51] now
[1:12:52] all this brings us to
[1:12:55] is that it makes us
[1:12:58] get home sick for heaven
[1:13:03] when you look at the happiness
[1:13:09] that there is no more fear of God
[1:13:12] people don't fear God anymore
[1:13:14] that is why there is so much evil on the
[1:13:17] land
[1:13:18] you look at the chaos
[1:13:21] you look up moral degeneration
[1:13:24] you look at the words
[1:13:27] everything that is going on
[1:13:29] there is just one thing
[1:13:31] that comes into mind it makes you more
[1:13:34] homesick
[1:13:35] for heaven
[1:13:37] if you are not getting homesick
[1:13:41] for heaven
[1:13:43] then there is something wrong
[1:13:47] if you are making this your home
[1:13:50] then there is everything wrong
[1:13:55] if you are not getting homesick for
[1:13:57] heaven it speaks volumes
[1:14:01] as I said one time
[1:14:04] that I can never get home sick
[1:14:07] for Afghanistan
[1:14:09] because I don't belong there
[1:14:11] I don't even know where on the map it is
[1:14:15] praise the Lord
[1:14:18] but I can get home sick
[1:14:20] for Ghana
[1:14:22] because that is where I come from
[1:14:26] it doesn't matter how bad life was
[1:14:29] it doesn't matter whether we're living
[1:14:31] in a machine or in the bush
[1:14:33] there is just something about your
[1:14:36] childhood and your origin
[1:14:39] that you can't just forget
[1:14:41] and again there is just something about
[1:14:43] our true origin that you can never
[1:14:46] forget of
[1:14:49] so when you are getting home sick for
[1:14:52] heaven it shouldn't surprise you
[1:14:56] it tells you that you belong
[1:14:59] because you can never get home sick for
[1:15:02] a place you don't belong
[1:15:05] so for you getting home sick
[1:15:08] for heaven
[1:15:10] and thinking of going one of these days
[1:15:14] it tells you
[1:15:16] who you truly are
[1:15:18] and where you belong
[1:15:21] if you are not getting thirsty for the
[1:15:24] kingdom of God and you are not getting
[1:15:26] homesick for the kingdom of God
[1:15:29] and you are not feeling like it's time
[1:15:31] to go
[1:15:33] it's time to go
[1:15:35] and you are seeing this here
[1:15:39] as your place
[1:15:42] and you want to live a hundred years
[1:15:43] here
[1:15:45] there is a problem
[1:15:48] so all that is going on
[1:15:51] though it breaks our house
[1:15:53] what we hear of these stories
[1:15:57] a young lady that is coming up
[1:16:00] that has accepted Christ has a Lord and
[1:16:03] personal Savior and she's so happy she
[1:16:05] has passed her exam and she puts it out
[1:16:07] there and that becomes a death sentence
[1:16:09] it breaks your heart
[1:16:13] the kingdom of God does not know
[1:16:15] distance
[1:16:17] it doesn't matter whether it happened to
[1:16:19] the at the end of the world it doesn't
[1:16:20] mean anything
[1:16:22] in one way or the other we are all
[1:16:25] intricately intertwined connected
[1:16:27] together
[1:16:29] it breaks your heart
[1:16:31] It Makes You Weep it makes you ask
[1:16:34] questions
[1:16:38] we are serving a great and a wonderful
[1:16:41] God
[1:16:43] oh power in heaven and on Earth
[1:16:47] belong to him
[1:16:49] there is nothing he cannot do
[1:16:53] can you imagine
[1:16:56] was it last two weeks
[1:16:58] but what was preaching a preached about
[1:17:00] Palace judgment Hall
[1:17:04] a man that is sitting
[1:17:06] and listening to these people
[1:17:09] who could have called Legions of angels
[1:17:13] to come and fight for him
[1:17:15] who could have just spoken
[1:17:19] and all of them would disappear
[1:17:22] and yet
[1:17:24] with all the power and the authority he
[1:17:27] had
[1:17:27] to change the circumstances in a moment
[1:17:31] of time he sat down
[1:17:33] and they will speak and speak and speak
[1:17:36] and he'll look at them and would not
[1:17:37] even utter a word
[1:17:40] the police said but you not speak
[1:17:43] can't you speak
[1:17:45] are you not hearing all these
[1:17:47] allegations
[1:17:53] he would not speak
[1:17:55] and you know
[1:17:58] when a man has power an authority you
[1:18:01] can't get them to be silent
[1:18:07] you can't get them to be quiet
[1:18:10] you can't
[1:18:14] so that baffle them
[1:18:19] and that shows his greatness
[1:18:25] never a sign of weakness
[1:18:27] ensures his greatness
[1:18:31] and if ever you find yourself going
[1:18:33] through something
[1:18:34] and you are looking forward to the Lost
[1:18:37] intervention
[1:18:38] and you are not seeing anything happen
[1:18:41] it doesn't show that the Lord is weak
[1:18:44] he himself sat down in his own judgment
[1:18:48] and he didn't utter a word
[1:18:51] does it surprise you
[1:18:53] that you are going through something and
[1:18:55] then he sits down and he looks at here
[1:18:57] doesn't say anything
[1:19:00] sure
[1:19:02] praise the Lord
[1:19:05] it's play a good cause
[1:19:08] always remember
[1:19:11] that this is not our home
[1:19:14] we have a place to go to
[1:19:16] anything we live we'll continue to brag
[1:19:19] about him
[1:19:22] like unto him too he is a great and a
[1:19:25] wonderful God
[1:19:27] and we shall serve him whether rain or
[1:19:29] shine
[1:19:30] whether it is snowing whether it is
[1:19:33] raining whether they close the doors
[1:19:35] whichever way We Shall Serve God we
[1:19:38] shall magnify His holy name
[1:19:40] praise be to God
[1:19:43] praise God
[1:19:45] the Lord our God is great
[1:19:49] Hallelujah
[1:19:53] the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:56] is dripping with blood
[1:20:00] is dripping with blood
[1:20:03] All Through the Ages
[1:20:06] like Elijah
[1:20:08] was crying before God
[1:20:10] and he said they have killed all the
[1:20:12] prophets and he's just left with me
[1:20:15] alone
[1:20:15] and God said no
[1:20:17] I have seven thousand that have not
[1:20:21] bowed their needs to bow
[1:20:23] praise be to God it doesn't matter how
[1:20:26] many they killed there will see the
[1:20:28] people here to magnify God
[1:20:31] praise be to God
[1:20:34] you can never map out a strategy for God
[1:20:39] the Bible says his words are passed
[1:20:41] finding out
[1:20:43] because it's a great and a wonderful God
[1:20:47] who will come map out the strategy for
[1:20:49] God
[1:20:51] the gospel is dripping with blood
[1:20:55] a lot have gone by the edge of the sword
[1:21:01] some
[1:21:03] were staked and bent alive
[1:21:07] and even in the midst of the fire
[1:21:11] there is an account that as a fire was
[1:21:14] Raising as I was set on fire and the
[1:21:17] fire was raging the sea lifted up their
[1:21:19] hands and still praise God in the midst
[1:21:22] of the flames
[1:21:23] wonderful praise be to God
[1:21:27] they were not shouting and crying no
[1:21:29] they're still lifted up their hands with
[1:21:32] the fire region and they praised God
[1:21:36] what a rebuke to the devil
[1:21:40] Samuel state
[1:21:42] and they made animals to feed on them
[1:21:44] alive
[1:21:45] some were thrown in the Lion's Den
[1:21:50] somewhere Sun asunder
[1:21:53] some were crucified upside down
[1:21:57] this gospel
[1:21:59] is dripping with blood
[1:22:02] it is not something you should take
[1:22:04] lightly
[1:22:07] never never
[1:22:08] take the word of God lightly
[1:22:13] this is life
[1:22:16] this is life
[1:22:19] praise be to God
[1:22:22] I have seen a video
[1:22:25] of a car that went up your flames
[1:22:28] and there was a Bible lying on the door
[1:22:30] on the dash on the dashboard
[1:22:32] the whole car was bent
[1:22:34] fire never touched the Bible
[1:22:39] this is life
[1:22:42] praise be to God
[1:22:45] Heaven and Earth shall pass away by the
[1:22:48] word of God would never pass away
[1:22:50] why judge of his word would never pass
[1:22:53] away
[1:22:55] feed on the word let the word take on
[1:22:59] flesh in you
[1:23:00] praise be to God
[1:23:03] wow my goodness
[1:23:10] when the word of God Lives in You
[1:23:15] you know
[1:23:17] that death is not your portion
[1:23:24] there is so much power in this world
[1:23:27] so much power
[1:23:29] that if you have the word of God in you
[1:23:33] and you even find yourself in hell
[1:23:36] is going to change
[1:23:39] it's going to have a different name
[1:23:41] it will not be hell anymore
[1:23:43] why
[1:23:44] because the son of God
[1:23:47] has entered there
[1:23:53] we saw that
[1:23:57] when Meshach Shadrach and Abednego
[1:23:59] were causing the ferry Phoenix
[1:24:03] when they refuse to Bow before the image
[1:24:06] up
[1:24:10] seven times
[1:24:12] when he looked at them he just saw three
[1:24:15] Renegades
[1:24:17] who would not bow to the King's Command
[1:24:20] that was the fourth person among them
[1:24:23] who had been with them all the way
[1:24:26] but he never saw them
[1:24:29] and they themselves
[1:24:33] they were just speaking of themselves
[1:24:35] three of them and they just said one to
[1:24:37] another we know the Lord Our God will
[1:24:40] deliver us and even if he doesn't we
[1:24:43] would not bow
[1:24:46] they didn't know that there was a fourth
[1:24:48] person
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:24:56] in
[1:24:58] Nebuchadnezzar could even sit in his
[1:25:00] seat anymore he jumped up he said did we
[1:25:02] know cast three people inside there I
[1:25:04] can see the fourth one like the son of
[1:25:06] man who told him that
[1:25:10] sometimes God just allows situations to
[1:25:14] come so you can see him
[1:25:18] praise be to God
[1:25:21] to let you know
[1:25:23] now we have not believed cunningly
[1:25:26] devised Fables
[1:25:28] that we have believed the truth the life
[1:25:30] of God
[1:25:33] God just allows it so you can see his
[1:25:36] glory
[1:25:39] he would have stopped it but he just
[1:25:42] permitted it
[1:25:44] praise be to God and the Lord our God is
[1:25:47] with us
[1:25:49] it is a promise he has made and God
[1:25:52] keeps his word
[1:25:53] that I will be with you always
[1:25:57] are we
[1:25:58] and God has not delivered us from our
[1:26:02] past from our sins and our trespasses
[1:26:04] only to abandon us no
[1:26:07] praise be to God
[1:26:09] he is bringing us onto an expected end
[1:26:12] for his name's sake
[1:26:15] for his name's sake
[1:26:18] praise be to God
[1:26:20] how many remember that sermon brother
[1:26:21] one preached
[1:26:22] for his name's sake
[1:26:27] there is nothing in our past
[1:26:31] there is nothing in the present time
[1:26:33] there is nothing in the future
[1:26:36] that can undo what God has already done
[1:26:43] sometimes we
[1:26:47] means it cannot overturn but I'm not
[1:26:49] going to say that what God has done is
[1:26:52] casting Stone instant casting stone is
[1:26:55] cast in the blood in the blood of the
[1:26:58] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:00] that what God himself has done God can
[1:27:03] never undo it anymore
[1:27:05] it is settled forever
[1:27:08] it is settled
[1:27:10] it is settled
[1:27:12] praise be to God it is settled
[1:27:17] we have a place to go
[1:27:20] the good ways God has started in you
[1:27:23] God is going to follow through
[1:27:26] God is going to follow through every one
[1:27:28] of them
[1:27:30] a lot of the times we are our own
[1:27:33] obstacles
[1:27:35] a lot of the times we are in our own way
[1:27:38] and then we keep complaining we are not
[1:27:40] seeing God
[1:27:45] excuse me
[1:27:49] the good words God has started
[1:27:52] he will surely bring you to completion
[1:27:56] so don't worry
[1:27:59] don't worry
[1:28:01] how you are going to exit this life
[1:28:04] don't go to bed thinking about it
[1:28:08] God has already figured it out
[1:28:16] God has already figured it out
[1:28:20] you could be like someone Peter
[1:28:24] who was crucified upside down
[1:28:26] you could be like Stephen
[1:28:28] who was thrown to death
[1:28:31] oh this lady we just talked about
[1:28:32] Deborah
[1:28:34] you could also be like John
[1:28:37] in a pot of boiling oil
[1:28:42] God has already figured it out
[1:28:46] don't spend your precious time
[1:28:49] thinking about how you're going to exit
[1:28:51] this life
[1:28:53] use that time to get closer to God
[1:28:58] use that time to serve God
[1:29:01] use that time to seek a face of God and
[1:29:04] to wait on God
[1:29:08] God has already figured that out
[1:29:15] is your life
[1:29:16] with Christ
[1:29:19] it is not your Allegiance
[1:29:21] to the church
[1:29:24] or to the people of God
[1:29:28] it's your personal relationship
[1:29:31] with Christ
[1:29:34] that is what you should be concerned
[1:29:36] about
[1:29:37] that is why you should examine by day
[1:29:39] and by night
[1:29:42] your personal work with God
[1:29:46] is that the economy
[1:29:49] the economy can never get better
[1:29:53] U.S is owing
[1:29:55] um
[1:29:56] I think is 31 trillion
[1:30:00] is it 31 trillion dollars
[1:30:03] something in that range
[1:30:06] and then they had to they had to extend
[1:30:09] the the what did they call it again
[1:30:13] the hunter extend it again as the
[1:30:16] governor is going to go bankrupt
[1:30:18] and I think it's gone up to 33 Bill 33
[1:30:21] trillion now
[1:30:22] so it is not getting any better
[1:30:26] the economy don't waste what I'm
[1:30:28] thinking about the economy
[1:30:31] it's not going to get any better
[1:30:34] don't waste your time thinking about the
[1:30:36] stock market
[1:30:37] it just go up and buy and just come down
[1:30:40] like that don't waste your time
[1:30:45] what you should spend your time on
[1:30:49] is your personal relationship
[1:30:52] Christ
[1:30:55] my brother said
[1:30:57] in the message best friends
[1:31:00] that if we should have
[1:31:03] a George Washington
[1:31:05] and Abraham Lincoln
[1:31:07] in every County of the United States
[1:31:12] they couldn't make anything better
[1:31:14] nothing is going to change
[1:31:18] it wouldn't change anything
[1:31:25] and these are men
[1:31:28] that this country so much respects
[1:31:31] because of what they stood for
[1:31:34] me they couldn't change anything
[1:31:38] what you should be doing
[1:31:42] as the time
[1:31:45] is getting to its end
[1:31:48] who is on his way out there is no doubt
[1:31:51] whether we believe it or not time is on
[1:31:54] its way out
[1:31:56] what you should be doing is just
[1:31:58] examining every single step you take
[1:32:01] the things you do
[1:32:04] that change your treasure
[1:32:06] where your heart is
[1:32:08] is your heart here is your heart on the
[1:32:11] things of God
[1:32:12] what are you thinking about
[1:32:15] what is life for you
[1:32:18] what matters to you actually in this
[1:32:20] life
[1:32:21] is it Christ
[1:32:23] is it your personal plans and ambitions
[1:32:26] is it a goal that you have set for
[1:32:28] yourself
[1:32:30] the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom
[1:32:34] of God and all his righteousness and all
[1:32:37] other things shall be added unto you but
[1:32:40] a lot of the times we reverse it
[1:32:43] instead of seeking Christ first
[1:32:45] one is seek all other things before we
[1:32:50] come seeking God it doesn't work that
[1:32:52] way
[1:32:54] put God first
[1:32:57] put God first in your daily work with
[1:33:01] him put God first
[1:33:03] in your academic work put God first
[1:33:06] at work put God first in church put God
[1:33:10] first let God Be Your absolute
[1:33:19] praise be to God
[1:33:21] it's a minute to nine
[1:33:38] um I will just keep a few things
[1:33:41] here
[1:33:44] there is a word I see my fight unto a
[1:33:46] man
[1:33:48] the Bible says
[1:33:50] by the end thereof is death
[1:33:53] I just want to encourage ourselves
[1:33:55] tonight Lord
[1:33:58] never lean
[1:34:00] on your own understanding
[1:34:03] learn to lean on God
[1:34:07] there is a way that God has chosen for
[1:34:11] you
[1:34:12] and where God has ordained
[1:34:15] for you to walk in
[1:34:18] learn to walk
[1:34:20] in God's way
[1:34:22] in the way that God has ordained the
[1:34:25] path that God has chosen for you walk in
[1:34:28] that path
[1:34:31] there are a lot of side attractions
[1:34:36] straight
[1:34:37] is the gate and narrow is the way
[1:34:41] that lead us to life and feel Debbie
[1:34:46] that find it
[1:34:50] but
[1:34:52] where is the gates and brothers away
[1:34:55] that leads to destruction and many
[1:34:57] diabetes that go in there right
[1:35:05] our steps
[1:35:07] are ordered of the Lord
[1:35:10] the steps of the righteous
[1:35:13] are ordered of the Lord
[1:35:16] you don't work
[1:35:18] where Christ wouldn't work
[1:35:23] you don't carry yourself
[1:35:25] to a place
[1:35:27] where Christ wouldn't go
[1:35:30] you don't eat something or drink
[1:35:33] something or smoke something
[1:35:35] that Christ within it drink or smoke
[1:35:42] no
[1:35:45] that you are a child of God
[1:35:48] fearfully and wonderfully made in the
[1:35:50] image of God
[1:35:52] and you are here to advertise Christ
[1:35:58] because the Bible says we are written
[1:36:00] Epistles
[1:36:02] we are here to advertise Christ what do
[1:36:05] these people who advertise this what do
[1:36:07] they do they just put some nice picture
[1:36:11] of a meal you know that when you see the
[1:36:14] picture you get hungry
[1:36:16] and sometimes you even buy it especially
[1:36:19] me
[1:36:23] praise the Lord
[1:36:25] I don't know the American food very well
[1:36:28] so at work we have a cafeteria I would
[1:36:32] go and I don't know what to order
[1:36:35] so I'll be standing and then watching
[1:36:37] when somebody orders something I like it
[1:36:39] I'll just come by I say okay what you
[1:36:42] just give this person I want the same
[1:36:44] thing
[1:36:46] and sometimes they'll even embarrass you
[1:36:50] they have just said the person and you
[1:36:53] are telling them I want the same thing
[1:36:54] he gave that man
[1:36:56] they say um do you want anything
[1:36:58] different different things
[1:37:01] is that American cheese or something
[1:37:04] cheese
[1:37:05] uh have what percent how many how many
[1:37:08] percent of milk oh did they just
[1:37:11] embarrass you
[1:37:16] so
[1:37:18] but after covered a lot of things
[1:37:20] changed after covet that now that is
[1:37:22] there is there is there is an app you
[1:37:25] just sit in the office and then you can
[1:37:28] see the picture and then you just send
[1:37:30] it in when the food is ready you go and
[1:37:31] pick your tin up
[1:37:33] praise the Lord and sometimes when you
[1:37:36] go for the food it doesn't taste like
[1:37:38] you saw it
[1:37:44] so
[1:37:46] adverts
[1:37:47] that is what advertising is meant to do
[1:37:50] they just advertise it
[1:37:52] nice picture very attractive
[1:37:55] and then you see that you are hungry for
[1:37:57] it
[1:37:58] that is how we ought to be
[1:38:02] to be we ought to advertise Christ
[1:38:04] every moment of Our Lives
[1:38:07] that people who see our lesson get
[1:38:09] thirsty for Christ
[1:38:13] that the Bible not say that we are the
[1:38:15] salt of the earth
[1:38:17] if you lose your saltiness what is your
[1:38:20] value anymore
[1:38:25] leave Christ
[1:38:27] and let people see Christ
[1:38:29] and let them get so hungry for Christ
[1:38:31] that they would come they want to come
[1:38:34] and see
[1:38:37] praise be to God come and see
[1:38:42] come and see
[1:38:44] and then when they come God takes over
[1:38:47] praise be to God
[1:38:49] I want to run I just want to speed um I
[1:38:52] just want to oh my goodness there is
[1:38:54] something here
[1:38:55] um is there nobody working tonight
[1:39:07] so
[1:39:09] is good
[1:39:12] that
[1:39:14] you get the Holy Ghost it's a must
[1:39:19] we can't
[1:39:21] we can't change that for anything
[1:39:26] the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our
[1:39:28] Resurrection
[1:39:31] is The Surety you have
[1:39:36] that there is a place for you on the
[1:39:37] other side
[1:39:41] everybody says even without the Holy
[1:39:44] Ghost baptism you have not yet you are
[1:39:46] not even a Christian to begin with
[1:39:52] if you do not have the Holy Ghost pray
[1:39:55] for the Holy Ghost
[1:39:58] for the Bible says the book of jawah
[1:40:00] that he will pour out his Spirit upon
[1:40:02] All Flesh
[1:40:06] it's a promise
[1:40:08] and you can hold God to his promise any
[1:40:12] day any moment under any condition
[1:40:17] because God will do exactly what he has
[1:40:19] said he will do
[1:40:21] Nothing Stops him
[1:40:27] don't settle for anything
[1:40:30] do not settle for church membership
[1:40:35] do not settle for anything less
[1:40:39] make sure
[1:40:42] that your life is locked in with Christ
[1:40:48] get the Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] and it is the Father's good pleasure
[1:40:56] to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:41:00] sometimes you pray or you pray person no
[1:41:02] I'm not getting the Holy Ghost
[1:41:05] God is more willing as Barbara said to
[1:41:08] give you the holy ghost that you you are
[1:41:10] willing to
[1:41:17] get
[1:41:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:41:21] the Bible says
[1:41:23] ask
[1:41:26] and you will receive seek and you shall
[1:41:28] find
[1:41:30] knock and the dust shall be opened unto
[1:41:31] you
[1:41:33] foreign
[1:41:45] unto them
[1:41:47] and the Bible goes on to say that ye
[1:41:50] being evil
[1:41:52] if you know how to give good gifts unto
[1:41:56] your children to the extent that when
[1:41:59] your church you ask of fish you will not
[1:42:01] give them a snake
[1:42:05] if you are so evil you know how to do
[1:42:07] good how would your heavenly father give
[1:42:11] you the Holy Ghost
[1:42:13] to them that ask for the Holy Ghost how
[1:42:15] would your health praise be to God
[1:42:18] what a wonderful father he is
[1:42:21] praise be to God
[1:42:26] you think God will promise you the Holy
[1:42:29] Ghost and not give it to you
[1:42:34] why would Jesus tell the disciples to
[1:42:37] tarry in Jerusalem not to depart until
[1:42:40] they were endured with power and
[1:42:41] authority
[1:42:42] and then turn around and deny you
[1:42:49] the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:42:52] a must
[1:42:55] it's not taking on identity as a church
[1:42:57] member
[1:42:59] it's a good thing to come to church
[1:43:04] it's a good thing to read your Bible
[1:43:09] it's a good thing to pray
[1:43:12] it's a good thing to do good
[1:43:16] but if that is always settle for and you
[1:43:19] are not willing to go further
[1:43:21] then there is a problem
[1:43:23] is just like a plane
[1:43:26] a plane that is
[1:43:28] 36 000 feet
[1:43:31] because that is the rain they fly
[1:43:33] 36 38 39 in between there
[1:43:37] so I play that is 36 000 feet in the air
[1:43:41] and then they look down and they see the
[1:43:44] houses and all those High scrapers they
[1:43:46] see them small small small on the ground
[1:43:48] sometimes I don't even see anything all
[1:43:50] they see is Skies
[1:43:51] the clouds
[1:43:53] now just imagine yourself
[1:43:58] religion is a very dangerous thing
[1:44:02] very very dangerous I'm going to say
[1:44:05] this and how close that I will not I'll
[1:44:07] just
[1:44:07] yeah I'll just put I'll just end with
[1:44:10] this
[1:44:11] now
[1:44:14] never compare yourself to one another
[1:44:17] because the Bible says that if you do
[1:44:20] that you are not wise
[1:44:23] and a lot of the times
[1:44:25] we don't even do that even though there
[1:44:28] is no wisdom in it but we even go below
[1:44:32] to compare ourselves
[1:44:34] to the people in the world
[1:44:37] I don't dress the way they dress
[1:44:40] I don't speak the way they speak
[1:44:45] I have my pants
[1:44:47] my belt is on my waist
[1:44:50] is falling I don't even know how they
[1:44:52] manage to do that
[1:44:54] one time I put on my pants
[1:44:57] in the living room I was just going to
[1:44:59] get my belt in the other room and I was
[1:45:02] just before I got to this I was tired
[1:45:05] already
[1:45:08] and you see them you see them both young
[1:45:11] and old and the pace is falling and they
[1:45:14] are just there all day
[1:45:16] they walk one two three and they'll pull
[1:45:18] it up one two three they'll pull it up
[1:45:20] and you wonder what is going on in their
[1:45:22] heads
[1:45:25] oh I don't behave I don't talk the way
[1:45:27] they talk
[1:45:28] these are people that have not come to
[1:45:31] the knowledge of the world
[1:45:33] these are people that have not have that
[1:45:35] privilege to hear the word
[1:45:38] and you are comparing yourself to them
[1:45:41] you have demoted yourself
[1:45:43] it's a beautiful sight
[1:45:49] and that is what happens
[1:45:51] when you see yourself
[1:45:54] spiritually speaking now 36 000 feet
[1:45:58] in the skies
[1:46:00] and then you look down and you are
[1:46:02] seeing those unbelievers
[1:46:04] so oh I'm not like them oh these are
[1:46:07] just a bunch of useless people oh
[1:46:10] um I am way up there
[1:46:12] one thing is certain
[1:46:14] one thing is certain
[1:46:16] to be in the air 36 000 feet it shows
[1:46:21] that you are not where you used to be
[1:46:27] but it equally means that you have not
[1:46:30] arrived yet
[1:46:33] because the Bible says
[1:46:36] never let complications
[1:46:38] set in
[1:46:41] it doesn't matter how high you go there
[1:46:44] is still room to go
[1:46:46] it doesn't matter how much of God you
[1:46:48] have in your life there is some more of
[1:46:50] God to experience
[1:46:52] never be complacent with anything
[1:46:57] 36 000 feet in the skies
[1:47:00] it can be a cup half full
[1:47:04] it can also be a cup half empty
[1:47:09] when you get there and you think I have
[1:47:12] arrived it becomes a cup half empty
[1:47:19] it's just a matter of time
[1:47:22] that you are going to throw in the towel
[1:47:25] and then tell the world that you don't
[1:47:26] believe anymore
[1:47:30] but it becomes a cup half full that when
[1:47:33] you find yourself there you said I am
[1:47:36] still going up there is no complacency
[1:47:38] in this business
[1:47:40] keep going
[1:47:41] keep pushing on keep pressing on
[1:47:45] the Bible says why do people call heresy
[1:47:48] that's the way we serve the god of our
[1:47:50] fathers
[1:47:51] it doesn't have to make sense to the
[1:47:53] world
[1:47:56] keep pushing up
[1:47:59] keep pushing on I promise to end on this
[1:48:03] and I'm going to keep my promise somehow
[1:48:05] press be to God
[1:48:07] oh yes
[1:48:09] I think I think okay I will do my best
[1:48:13] shall we open to Second Corinthians
[1:48:17] second Corinthians four
[1:48:31] second Corinthians
[1:48:35] the musicians can come over
[1:48:39] to show that I mean it
[1:48:42] praise the Lord
[1:48:44] yes
[1:48:46] all right
[1:48:48] second Corinthians 4.
[1:48:51] chapter eight uh chapter 4 verse 8.
[1:48:57] 4 8.
[1:49:01] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:49:04] distressed
[1:49:07] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:49:11] persecuted but not forsaken
[1:49:14] cast down
[1:49:16] but not destroy it
[1:49:18] praise be to God
[1:49:20] always bearing about in the body the
[1:49:23] diet of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:49:25] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:49:29] our body 11 for we which are always
[1:49:33] delivered unto death for Jesus sake
[1:49:36] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:49:39] made manifest in our
[1:49:41] mortal flesh
[1:49:43] certain death record in us but life in
[1:49:46] you
[1:49:47] we having the same Spirit by faith
[1:49:50] according as it is written I believed
[1:49:55] and therefore have I spoken we also
[1:49:59] believe
[1:50:00] and therefore speak
[1:50:03] verse 14
[1:50:05] knowing that he which raised up
[1:50:09] the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[1:50:13] Jesus and shall present us
[1:50:17] with you praise be to God
[1:50:21] oh yes this is why I want to bring the
[1:50:24] curtain down
[1:50:27] it doesn't matter what troubles we go
[1:50:29] through
[1:50:30] it doesn't matter the persecutions
[1:50:33] it doesn't matter what it is we are not
[1:50:35] a blessed we are not cast down
[1:50:37] one good thing when your soul is saved
[1:50:41] when you have the body goes baptism when
[1:50:45] you are sealed in praise be to God it
[1:50:48] doesn't matter what happens
[1:50:50] it doesn't matter what happens
[1:50:53] it doesn't matter what happens
[1:50:55] the game is ended
[1:50:58] praise be to God
[1:51:00] shall we give the Lord a clap of fruit
[1:51:02] tonight
[1:51:04] [Applause]
[1:51:08] it's risk
[1:51:11] I just want to cooperate I want to take
[1:51:14] over
[1:51:14] [Music]
[1:51:16] God bless you once again

[1:51:22] the Lord
[1:51:25] met you
