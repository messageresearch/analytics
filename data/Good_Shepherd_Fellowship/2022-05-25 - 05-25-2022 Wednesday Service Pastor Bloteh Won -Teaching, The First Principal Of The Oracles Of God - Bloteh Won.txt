so he will be coming into to visit with us that week he should be preaching on a wednesday night and then and then on sunday morning and i know there are uh some of the other brothers that would love to having uh minister for them on uh during the week so we will see how we will arrange the service but that's what he's planned for if you fly in on wednesday and then preach for us wednesday night still to the weekend we'll visit a little bit and chat on some different things and then uh he will preach for us on sunday and then he will be flying to over to arizona where he have some meetings with brother doug baker and then catch up with some few other meetings around the country before he travel back to nigeria his dad has retired uh so he's uh pretty much uh has stepped in as the pastor day of the local church there in illegal so he's he can stay out as as he as he will want to or used to and then after that weekend also we should have a weekend service with brother ben nero that will be a weekend service so we will have no service on a wednesday night because of that and then we are hoping that we have good weather uh we might use uh the saturday night just for praise and worship uh it's gonna be something like it's inspiration that saturday night i would just be just just singing worship and then but as we get close to that and we will we will make the program formal for every one of us so that's what we have but jordan will speak for us this coming sunday so let's pray for our brother that the lord will will be able to bless him he as he brings the word of the lord to us this sunday praise the lord so we will remind you of the different events that we have [Music] we have a long weekend july 4th also so we are hoping to have a special service and fellowship that we can and i'm hoping that we can have brother clay farmer to be with us that weekend and so we will confirm all of that as we get along i know that brother-in-law should be around too so we will have some fellowship with him when he comes in so those are just some of the few things that we have coming up that we have scheduled to do brother frank prater is having a youth meeting for the kids of all ages is having most especially for the little ones and i was hoping that i could really plan out something to be able to have the little kids go so we working on that and uh if we can get the planes together we would love to take all the little children there to to have uh to have some kind of a fellowship so we that just prayed and see if the lord will be able to bless us to just arrange things in the proper way praise the lord so those are just a few things that we we have uh i also have uh uh brother plane take is having this annual meeting and uh we've been asked to speak for them on that uh weekend that would be the first weekend in june so uh i will be away for those services as well so just keep meeting prayers i need all the prayers that i can get so when you get before the lord just uh remember me let's stand on our feet tonight and uh and we will sing a chorus here and then we turn to the pages of the bible just for the little word of hesitation tonight you were playing [Music] a chorus there i'm amazed yeah let's sing there now [Music] yes [Music] let's sing that again yes i'm a miss that you love me i'm amazed how you care and through your precious blood i'll vampire and my sins [Music] watch they are all washed away oh my saints i washed away yes i'm amazed that you love me i'm amazed know how you care and through your precious blood i found power and my saints i wash [Music] their washed away all my saints are washed away [Music] praise the lord let's take our bibles tonight thank you sister naomi we appreciate you praise the lord hebrew chapter 5. hebrew chapter 5. we'll try to find a way to finish our our subject that we started on uh on uh sunday we try to find uh get back to dating and be able to properly arrange ourselves and get in and be able to go back and i would have loved to gone through the entire uh matthew chapter 24 in parallel with revelation chapter six but we'll get back to that so uh uh let's look at something here that paul addressed to the believers here i want to find a decent place to start from the verse i want to read is verse 12. let's look at verse 12. for what for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that won't teach you again which be the first principle of the oracles of god the phrase the first principle of the oracles of god caught my mind when i was uh reading uh studying true yet a little bit the first principle of the oracle of god so paul is saying teaching is the first principle of the oracle of god for when for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that won't teach you again which be the first principle of the oracle of god and uh become such as have need of milk and net of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belonged to them that are of full age which is those that are mature even those who by reason of youths have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil let's pray together heavenly father lord uh we just want to look at this first principle lord and so we are asking tonight that you bless lord father the service law bless the visible audience and those that are streaming the service tonight just lord let the holy spirit come with god and and be able to inspire us lord father and and break the bread of life break the word to our house tonight may we father be able to learn at your feet lord we give you the praise we give you the glory father bless your word now in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you praise the lord amen hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord what a wonderful wonderful uh father wonderful savior that that we have we can be able to just come in and enjoy his presence because he has been good to us amen now so uh uh just like uh i said we want to we just want to look at that phrase that uh uh the apostle used that teaching is the first principle of the auricles of god is the first principle of the holy course of god and uh i was i was looking at that uh and then some other few things started coming over for us to to you know look at so we will we will just trust the lord in and ask that he will be able to bless us tonight praise the lord a couple of uh services back we talked on how using the same phrase but in a different way how jesus says those that are taught how he draw us how teaching is the way that god draws us to himself you know when when he brings us to that place to be able to instruct us there are some few things that the prophet of god said and we want to look at them tonight and also paul says some things that as i look closely in the scripture i started to realize that even myself i got the picture wrong when i first talked that uh uh there's there's thought of what he was talking about and if i will create an example here for us to look at let's look at uh first corinthians chapter eight let's look at first corinthians chapter eight shhh first corinthians chapter 8 that's what i said i'm i'm over in second corinthian i'm sorry looking at it in his neck making sense to me paul says in verse 7 he says how be there is not in every man that knowledge for so for some with conscience of the idols on onto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto idol and their conscience being weak is defined but meat commanded us not i mean yeah commanded us not to god for neither if we eat uh we better neither if we eat net are we the worst but take it least by any means this liberty of of yours become a storming block to them that are weak now is is that is is those that are weak and uh that's that's that's what struck me when i when i actually realized the ones that paul was talking about if any man for if any man see thee we should have knowledge said admit in the idol temple shall not be conscious of him which is weak be uh in in border to eat those things which are offered to idols now so as we've been talking about a little better of the early church which was uh uh we had a lot of uh jewish believers there that was struggling with leaving the lord and coming on to what the grace of god have started to do so uh uh you know most of the time in in in time past this this is the way that i taught about this scripture i thought that the person that you know was uh uh struggling with eating meat what whatever that paul was dealing with there i really thought that it was the one there was there was the week i thought that the one that had just been converted from uh from idol worship you know they have given their heart to the lord and now he received that you know they stay eat uh at those feasts and all of that but as as he was telling the text you will realize that uh paul was talking to those ones and and the ones that were struggling with that were the ones that were not partaking of it right praise the lord the ones that were that were struggling with faith was the ones that were not partaking of faith the ones that were partaking of it because they you know something that they have been doing you know they don't feel condemned in it and they think that now they are they are believers they can continue their way and here is a group of believers you know that have come from a jewish background that had nothing to do with idols or things offered unto idols to be in the same same assembling scene all of these ones now that have now become believers you know that are gentiles you know partaking of those things these guys just like what happened to peter when the lord told him eat he said lord i have never eaten anything that is unclean praise the lord so you see because he was exposed to death he really did not have the boldness of faith to say well this is a vision from the lord or you know the law of saying speaking to me so i'm going to do it right now so uh you will soon grab the concept that uh i'm trying to bring tonight as we go along i'm just trying to use this to start up the water and see if you will be able to jump in it amen so we realize here that uh as paul is instructing these believers the the ones that have had unto the lord are the ones that are having difficulty to relax even if they will not partake of it to be able to accommodate those that will partake of faith right and what our sense of uh uh you know uh hesitation we go in in light of tonight is where brother branham talks about you know how with brotherly kindness which of course is that is a stage of grace and and faith that we walk into allow us to be able to accommodate you know and overlook support the ones that are struggling the ones that are dealing with things and and brother branham would bring it up in a way as we will see it as we go along it's in a way that it shows our maturity if we can now support the weak we are not growing right sure if we think that we are growing and in our growth we condemn everything around us it's not a sense of growth it's not a sense of growth it's a hidden fear praise the lord so the week once year in in in corinthian chapter 8 is not the ones that were eating right praise the lord is the ones that were offended have you seen the picture praise lord so that's the reason why paul is speaking to the the hebrew believers here and saying teaching is the first principle in the oracle of god praise the lord if we are not properly taught uh uh in the way that he was speaking to them you could be you could be holding the lord and zealious in the lord and yet you could be uh you know uh uh in in some sense uh uh condemned you could because you will realize as we look in the scripture paul did not only address that to the hebrew believers he spoke the same thing to to the christians in rome that why you you are now supposed to be uh uh uh mature christians you you are stay you are state babes and the end and word that uh that uh infant nature was is that they were stay they were they were holding to the lord they were holding to the lord and and and one of the reason there is that is because that's all they know the word has now become a revelation to them when the word becomes a revelation to you it frees you absolutely it frees you praise the lord when the word is just a law to you it bounces you you stay to that place where uh uh uh i mean uh you you you you look over your shoulder and uh uh you are afraid that uh you know uh you could do wrong and and you know and and you want to walk right in and all of that which of course is beautiful that that is the infant state amen just like uh you know i i i said before you know when when when the baby is is uh it's about to walk it's you know you you get we are all excited as he stands up but you see the consciousness that the the the father hand the parent hand is very close because we know he's not stable amen so all eyes are on him okay calm down come you know everybody watching and he's taking his come come you know it's almost like you're going back but you're going in front because you know that any moment he will lose balance are we together praise the lord teaching is the first oracle of god let me start here tonight brother branham talks something about his pastor roy davis and it was it was it was amazing to me and i was listening to to brother always owens juggers in uh a book that he wrote you know on brother branham live story and then i realized that you know brother branham talks about a preacher you know a young preacher that uh one time on an infidel ca you know uh uh unbelieving men challenge and says uh you know he brought uh uh uh something that was uh you know uh that could kill you know and he says you know jesus said you would drink the other things and you will not die you know and he says all you christians here and this was at a revival yeah he says all you christians here i challenge you if you believe what jesus says come and take this and drink it praise the lord and at that time rord davis there was a baptist boy the baptist minister he was a young baptist preacher and at the convention he was sitting in a meeting he was sitting in a meeting and uh and he was so challenged in his heart you know that that the infidel is making that challenge and and and everybody is just sitting down and looking at him you know and then and then roy davis uh being a young preacher uh because uh uh uh this this is one of the things that will that will you know that would bring uh uh uh it would challenge brother branham's faith you know so rod davis he he woke up from his seat and he says he went right there to the feeder and took uh uh well i think it was an assay or something like that you know and took it from his hands and he's and he says he's his church i will now stand here for this man you know to uh uh uh you know uh uh challenge uh you know us on the word of god if i died i know i'm going to my savior you know but i believe what jesus said that we would drink person and nothing will happen and he took that little bottle and he just drank it and the lord blessed his little faith and nothing happened to him you know and and and brother branham said at the time he he was just a young young christian he he said and he was just reading his bible he's he read it you know in in the scripture he said but when rob davis did that he says well he saw that in the church you know he heard uh rod david's testifying about that he said he sat down there he says well that was a good fit but i don't think you were wise why if you die you know that's that's uh that's a young you know uh young william branham saying that in his mind but what happened is that that also will influence brother branham you know it will influence brother branham on on on taking stand on god's word but in the way that it will influence him not just in his young baby stage you know it was influencing as he grows on i see as he understand the word of god you know and comes to maturity now brother brahm said something here in god keep his word it was actually a blessing to me when i when i listened to that because uh uh i've heard i've heard that testimony brother brown said it many times but i did not really put the picture together that it was it was roy davies that did that brother branham said yeah he said when i was first converted and was ordained in the baptist church i had a good old teacher the name of dr roy davis praise the lord amen so before brother branham will come to his ministry to be taught by the angel of the lord he had a good old teacher sure which was his pastor praise the lord so brother branham we will talk here he says he was a lawyer before his conversion and he took everything from a legal legal standpoint in the bible praise the lord amen now and then brother brown will talk about the the first time that he preached he says i remember my first semen i remember my first seminar i preach i preach on something praise the lord and and as you read the story down you know he he he talks about something and you know and and you know he's he's demonstrating all of these things and and how something compromises gifting you know when uh uh you know and he cried when he went on and i went over and had my hand tied to the pulse you know he says he's dramatizing this and all i went through every emotion that that i guess that i thought the preacher could go through and when and and when i noticed all david sitting there with his finger up to his mouth maybe probably sitting like this look looking at his uh his young preacher preaching and just sitting like this what is he doing you know he says and after the service was over i had made my altar call a lot of the old mothers woke up petting me on the shoulder oh they said billy that was wonderful and dr david said i want to see you in my study i said yes sir he said that was just about as ridiculous as i've ever heard in my life and then see see this uh this uh this young preacher preaching and and something and he compromised and they tie him you know then he's dramatizing all of that right oh it really took the sale off of me since when when when his pastor told him that he took the seal off of him well what's the matter dr david he said one time when i was practicing law now so he's he's bringing brother branham to the place not to feed on the emotion of the people okay now brother branham will learn from that and then he will he will he will bring us to the place and says uh you know uh that jesus did not die that somebody would feel sorry and gave their life to god you know he said that praise the lord you know so he's he's telling brother branham you know comparing it with lord and and you know you you you get in the court and uh uh you are the lawyer to defend the the you know the the guilty person you can you cannot tell the jury or you tell the court oh look at this little boy he's just an innocent boy can you see his face how innocent he is oh feel sorry for him his if he goes to prison his mother is going to cry you know that's that's what he's bringing brother bran and that you you cannot you can you you have to make your case you are there to defend that person you are not there to play on the emotion of the people and make them feel sorry you know so that's what he was watching now you see so brother bran i'm learning from there that's what he's pointing back to to say i had a good old teacher because he taught me yes because if ned he will have enough to be in this this preacher that will be preaching and says you know your mother was a good member of this church why can't you give your life to god son we dedicated you are this puppet and all you are doing you are just plain on the emotion of the person you are not bringing him to a place of conviction praise the lord so he says i had a good old teacher someone i can that that could correct him and says i mean i mean you you you don't preach like that what is that is that i say a drama we are here for right so are you are you grabbing the principle that i'm trying to bring to you because that is the first principle of the oracle of god teaching right sure praise the lord and even in our natural life as as we grew up from uh uh us as babies that's that's the first thing we're taught to say mama little baby said mama that's that's the first thing we are exposed to teaching praise the lord so brother branham goes through out of there this is a kind of a long conversation you might take the whole night so i just i just kind of for share that with you praise the lord and i'll drop down a little bit he says i think that was that that was a very good thing i said dr davis i thank you he said billy all of your emotion and going on and and and uh tying something to the pulse and and whipping him and putting his eyes out you don't get very much scripture men are not saved by emotion and all the little side stories you tell men saved by the word of god that's right if you don't give your life to jesus you will die you'll burn in hell you will just be burning praise the lord by you grabbing the picture amen so he's uh he's he's he's he's teaching brother branham to you know to stay with the word of god they'll bail you off your your message you know on the word of god and then and then moreover it again it brings us to the place you know just like i said on sunday you know we have a message praise the lord it's a message of the hour this is is what god has given to us the revealed word and the prophet of god says you know well you cannot take one verse in the bible and make a doctrine you got to run it through the scripture are we together yes right so if you bring that in comparison with the picture we look at in the book of corinthian you realize that uh those those early jewish believers that god stuck in in the in in the lord in you know in in what whatever was given to them that for them to be able to embrace yes these are the new believers that were coming uh you know people that were converted in korean from the worship of dinan and all of that to to be able to give them grace as long as they have not rise to their level no they were not saved yet praise the lord but the picture that i want you to see is there there in doing that those ones that were just saved were not the weaker ones are we together as we go along the picture we get clearer to you brother graham says something yet also in a message uh way to have fellowship he says this their word it is tonight god has to give it then love produce a fellowship now when god said back there that they their sin has separated that divine love god told adam and eve not to eat these setting fruits and they did and sin brought separation and and sin by separation brought hatred miley strife envy is that right what happened they separated from divine love and when you separate from divine love then you can overlook [Music] your brother's mistake no more praise the lord now in in in in another sense if you look at it in another sense in in uh in the sense of sticking with the lord us in the sense of uh in you know in our term we would say is uh the the legalist praise the lord right amen the legalists will look at it in in a way word he would think that is the is is is divine love you got to wreck that person down i mean you got to tell them the word of god whether they like it or not that's that's the love of god are we together but see the picture that brother branham is going to to to to present to us here now he says that they separate from divine love and when you separate from divine love then you can't overlook your brother's mistake no more you've got to bore him out amen you got to blast the guide praise the lord that's right they can overlook sister's mistake no more because you have got away from that divine path you are holding to the word but you have got away from that divine part praise the lord when a person do you wrong as a mortar as a falling motor bonus in ship shipley in iniquity it is the right thing for you to force back at the person that's what the fallen nature will do for you to forgive it's not natural right praise the lord you say brother one what are you preaching tonight amen i told someone that last night and uh and i said it and then it's it's just it's just quick into meanness oh my god uh i've never said this like this before and i've never seen it like this praise the lord so brother branham says you you you you have got away from that divine path that love fact but if you really love the lord jesus if a sister or the brother does something to you all well that's all right they didn't mean to do it praise the lord that's the kind of love that christ had father forgave them they didn't know what they were doing right praise the lord now you think about it now even though we we are looking at the fullness of god dwelling in this body but we have to realize that that that was the expression of the love of god christ was the expression of the love of god amen because on on on on the on the human level you know uh since i've been having ten thousand legions of angels i can call right now to just close this whole thing right yeah i hope you're getting the picture i'm trying to pin out tonight praise the lord you have to you have to see that we are drawing from from the from the top of where paul was saying you you needed to be teachers but it looks like you are you you are i mean you are you are stay babes because on the on the on the principal thing the elementary thing you have not grown up yet so that's that is the sense that we're trying to to project tonight but bam says and what if what if he had had my sin against me what an awful person i was but he loved me so well that he forgave me for them when i was on them he forgive me he loved me a pure love praise the lord amen now so uh i think you grab the sense of of what i'm talking about it's not in a place when a person does wrong you don't you don't tell them that what you did is wrong that's not what i'm saying sure but it's also in a place where the love of god in you will make accommodation for the person praise the lord you'll be able to bear with him let's take another thought here also divine healing he says everything that god promised is there is yours just ask for it anything that he died for belongs to you amen there it is it's the whole thing and and and how we love it is in it full to the soul yes it is amen that's the word of god and every time we believe now listen listen to me carefully now every time we believe believe what the word of god amen every time we receive the word of god every time we say lord be it unto me that calling to your word every time the word is preached we say amen we are we are claiming it as as ours our a man is not a chicked a man where you are thinking about somebody and says and preach it because you think it's somebody it belongs to you are saying amen because you are receiving the word praise the lord amen because the word is either a correction to you or is an instruction instructing you that these things might come up wash out and this is what you should do so you say amen thank you lord jesus praise the lord so he says every time we believe that little speck in there just get bigger every time you receive the correction of the word that little speck indeed just get bigger [Music] it gets bigger it swears out till after a while it just become you believe all things you get to the place where you don't struggle with the word of god praise the lord and as all things begin to coming love begins it comes in doubt hatred malice feared just flat out you see that you see the principle that john uh lays there in the book of john when we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness so brother branham says as we receive the word as we say amen to the word it begins to swir swirl in us it begins to get bigger and then feared and doubt and knowledge gossip it pushes it out are we together so is is is uh is the growth that we're beginning to see in that way it's maturity that we are coming to because now you realize that is the word that is giving you strength the word is the overcoming power amen you are not relying on your self-righteousness because if you are holding to self-righteousness it gave you the sense to think that i have achieved it so you can you must do the same thing are we together see where i am i have claimed on the ladder you have to come up to no but if you grow it in this way you say see where i am well take my hand let me bring you up now that you should come up are we together so down hatred molly's fear just flies out like that it just spray out just gets so bigger it's the word i keep tell it just burst a little all share out see what i mean all the word is part we grow daily in the grace of god praise the lord he said now you notice those people they can sit and say well i accept the lord you take their word for it i would too i can't judge god does but in 10 years from now they have never progressed a bit just staying right in the same old place no sense of growth no sense of growth you can tell from their conversation they are negative always tearing other people down praise the lord no sense of growth are we together yes sir so they have been 10 years there they have been hearing the word what has been lacking teaching teaching for them to be able to position themselves all their growth is how much they are attached to the local church our growth is now how long we have belonged to this church or how long we have been in the message our growth is in the word yes sir we must be growing in understanding he says we grow daily each day our hearts hunger keep moving on there is something growing inside of you praise the lord there is something growing inside of you amen it gets bigger it's prayer out paul said he told the corinthian church said you are mentoring you are growing but when you are to be teachers you are step babies needing teaching is that right when you are to be teacher sometimes he says something in there growing out putting out uh uh making bigger the holy spirit growing right you are growing in the statue of christ praise the lord the new birth if if a birth is born from the outside or from the inside out the child it grows if a life if it doesn't it remains is that right well when a birth is on the inside shouldn't it grow the christ in your heart ought to be growing daily praise the lord and that's to think that fights the enemy praise the lord that's the thing that fights the enemy that's the inner strength praise the lord the christ in your heart ought to be growing dearly getting bigger more powerful understanding things better forgiving walking on as god who till christ be form in you the hope of glory praise the lord we must contend with the weak until they are fully mature in christ jesus then they are good soldiers then they have got on the fore armor talk about them and you see there and and just and just like uh you know i've said before uh uh you know those those things happen especially in in family life you know uh [Music] we we uh sometimes put a lot of expectations a lot of burden even on the little kids that we don't see the area of their growth because we have created this picture in our mind that this is the way a christian supposed to be and as long as they are not measuring up to death we don't see the area of their growth right praise the lord sometimes uh uh husband do it to wife sometimes wife do it to a husband you know sometimes our brothers do it to sisters we have created this picture this is the bride of jesus christ praise the lord but before that lady became a bride she was first born a little girl right praise the lord it was not our birth that she became a bride this is not a muslim religion where we give babies to marriage we allow them to grow praise the lord we allow them to grow you know so all of those things are there let's look a few scriptures tonight and then okay praise the lord let's look in romans chapter 2. you get the picture from here from verse 17 behold thou thou i call a jewel and rested in the lord and make it that boss in god now as as we go with this thought paul we comes right back to the same thing so he says you know uh these believers there you know well uh they are in room they they they are they are jews they are resting in the law they are making their boss in the lord and know with his will and approve of the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the lord and are confident that they are thy self are the guide of the blind a light of them that are in darkness but what were they using just the law they never have the reveal word for their for their day amen the reveal word of the day was what the holy ghost was doing it was the message of paul the the messenger of that age they did not have the revealed word for their day so what were they doing they were sticking to self-righteousness they were making up their own righteousness by holding to the lord praise the lord so paul goes on a little bit yet and says an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babe which we should have a form of knowledge and of the truth in the lord because the law was just a shadow of good things to come so they had a form of knowledge of the truth now therefore which teaches another teachers not that self doubt they are preached preached and man should not steal does that steal praise the lord amen let me let me in uh uh let me read this a little bit from uh from the amplifier so you you can you can be able to appreciate verse 20 you are a corrector of the foolish a teacher of the childish having a law having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth well then you will teach others do not teach yourself why you teach against stealing do you steal take what does net really belongs to you praise the lord so you see you see where paul is is uh uh uh is kind of for bringing them to realize you know you you are holding to the lord but what actually is happening is that you are dealing with lot of guilt in you with all your self-righteousness you are now over your guilt right are we together he says here you who say do not commit adultery do you commit adultery are you unchaste in action and in thoughts now see here now let's let's take this this this uh uh amplifier verse and bring it to matthew chapter five jesus said it is written thou shalt not commit adultery but i said unto you that whosoever locket upon the woman so the law here paul is saying you you are saying that i do not commit adultery he says but what's happening in your mind what what's happening in your mind praise the lord are you on chasing action any types you who are hub and uh and i love others do you rob temple do you appropriate to your own use what is consecrated to god thus robbing the temple and doing sacrilege you must in the lord do you honor god by breaking the lord now so he's he's he's dealing also so so what just like what he expressed over in romans chapter 9 his zeal was after his brethren because he realized that they were they were they were zealous after the lord of god but the knowledge of god was not there right why because the revelation of the word see in christ from the old testament to the new they could not see it praise the lord you know and and and that's and that's the thing that that that happens in the world that we that we live in today praise the lord you have a you have a lot of these uh wonderful works that are done you know uh uh uh um in in the muslim world and you know and and none of those people now you realize that uh with some of the laws the the sharia law and all of that the people feel the suppression of that religion on them praise the lord so it's almost like if i confess the lord jesus christ as my lord and savior i'm free from that suppression but yet it does not mean that you have the revelation of the word no praise the lord you just only want to get away from that suppression well you cannot condemn him with the muslim law because i'm not a muslim i'm a christian but the understanding of of what christ have brought the the the the the the love of labor take that that set us free is not there praise the lord so you see that's the reason why god gave us all of these things he gave us a fightful ministry [Music] he put the gifts in the body praise the lord just like how a parent will buy a gift for a child even though it looks like a toy but in the same way is to be able to teach the child to know the alphabet even though the the child is going to play and and be touching the you know the the child touch uh d and it sounds like a dog the dog back right even though it's a toy but it's designed to teach because that is the first principle of life that brings that that shows our growth yes that's why when the child is at a setting age and they are not able to identify certain things it worries the pairing right even though they are growing in stature but their level of understanding now starts to be questionable right yes praise the lord so the same thing i mean uh in in in the local assembly is not is not to get a church for on sunday but we have to be growing in the world yes praise the lord we have to be growing in the understanding of what we are doing as a local assembly right what we are doing in this body as a local assembly praise the lord it's almost like uh uh uh trying to okay let me take another example tonight i'll leave you in a few minutes head shoulder knees and toes all the children lock it hair shoulder knees centers knees and toes hair shoulder knee centers what is that is for you to identify your body parts even though they love the music but it's designed for them to identify their body parts praise the lord and when the child sings that over and over something sticks in their mind that this is head so the parents where's your head head head shoulders knees and toes and shoulders knees and toes a place in their mind but the purpose is to teach yes praise the lord the purpose is to teach and pretty soon it sticks in the in the mind of the child that this is head and this is shoulder and this is knees and toes and you know and then and they learn about praise the lord you see that's the same way we have a responsibility to know our body parts in this liquid assembly this is a body this is a body let us not just desire to grow as a church where we don't have places for people to see them and then we think that is growth if we are not growing in understanding what we are doing as a local assembly praise the lord and you have little you know uh uh uh fusses here and little things that you know that is dragging in people's mind and uh that that's that's not a church that's a time bomb right when you're ready to explode then you wonder where all the worship gone where all the messages that was preached where did they go why because the people were not growing right they would just enjoying coming together i love to come together to see their their best friend i want let's sit down together let's sit down together when you go reserve my seat for me just just to enjoy that that communion together or that friend it's a good time for us to visit together that's not growth that's not growth praise the lord and it is the same thing that is happening to the society today as i was telling this i was thinking about it yeah there is five full ministry in the in in in in the in the in the church that is given to the church and one of those ministry is the teacher a man that that is blessed with the gift to teach he knows how to place the word he knows how to spread the word out he knows how to bring us and pick up things you know in the scripture pick up things in the message [Music] but you see yet he can be the you know wonderful we have wonderful gifted brothers that do that but in another sense the teaching of the local church rely on the pastor that's his responsibility the society has has fallen short of that because we think that the schools that we send our children to is responsible to teach them right praise the lord and we as parents we don't we don't we we don't get involved with what they are learning praise the lord right it's the home responsibility when paul when when when solomon said train up a child it has the same context of teaching yes praise the lord absolutely if not that's the reason why the the children have all the challenges out there and then when they come when they also have challenge at home right and then you know and the young and the young child can argue no that's that's that's what my teacher said [Music] he says no that's why that's what i'm at you don't know that i mean that's what my teacher said well because now a strong influence of teaching is from out there and there is a lesser influence from teaching in the home right yeah for sure praise the lord and when that when when when when the home teaching is weak then you see them you know starts to dress because the the the stronger influence of teaching is from outside so they pick up the dressing from outside they pick up their language from outside and they bring it home because the teaching home is weak teaching is the first principle is the first principle when the child get it out when the child get it from home when they go out they will challenge whatever they see out there absolutely say no my my my mom don't dress like that that's right we don't we don't dress like that that's the first principle and that's that's the parent's responsibility to teach the child you might not know uh uh what two times two is but you know what decency is praise the lord take for example when a when a parent is teaching division to a child what do they do they say so it says uh trinium if we have if we're having four four apple and you and mama and your sister and myself we about to divide it how many each person would take each person will take one now so you see that way of teaching keeps the family in the mind of the child they associate what they are learning with the home sure praise the lord the teacher will get on the ball and you know they will write all the letters they will they will say you know one two three four five six but when the parents are teaching it just happened subconsciously you always relate the teaching to what is happening home sure if you ate the thing that your mind gave gave you yesterday what would remain there so home stays in the mind of the child when they go out to school and a work is given to them they relate at home praise the lord but the the that that is the default of the society that we are living in the children are turned over to a destructive society to teach them praise praise the lord and that's and and that's some of the things that affect also the local church if the church is not rightly taught in the word and the people can you know just feed from the different youtube channel and listen to their different things that they are listening to they get confused sure if it creates a sense of resentment when the preacher is preaching now that their wrong teaching or whatever has you you have been following stays in the back of your mind is is now is you are now fighting with what what is coming from behind the puppet are we together do you see you see the the direction we were going tonight god's purpose is to bring us to maturity and our sense of growth is in a way that we are taught the beauty of the church is the character of the people is the character of the people right let's buy with his tonight better than you coming closest in prayer brother almost gracious and eternal father we thank this so much oh god for this moment that we have had to share together and to listen to your word once again we thank you so much that you have given us that which we have need of a lot of the times you don't even know what we need and we thank you so much lord jesus for having led your servant this way to speak to us words of eternal life lord for the bible says that all scripture is profitable for reproof for doctrine for correction and instruction in righteousness and your word says that your word would not go out and return unto devoid and we believe that your word that has gone forth tonight has accomplished its purpose and we pray dear lord jesus keep us anchored to your word of life lord do not let us ever stray from the part of righteousness may you order our steps before that great throne and let us reflect the beauty of christ in our daily work with you heaven and earth shall pass away but your word would never pass away grant us grace to continue to feed on your word lord the beauty of the church is the character of the people as your servant just said may you continue to work on us lord continue to work on us and bring us to that point where men may see our good words and give the glory to you knowing that it is only god who can do it we are so grateful that you have brought us this far you have loved us so much we didn't know that we were lovable but you have shown us so much love lord that there is nothing hell can do to tell us otherwise we bless you father tonight for having spoken to us from lip to ear and for having touched our lives in ways we never expected was possible we bless you father tonight we glorify the father and we worship you with all our hearts and with all our souls and with every fiber of our being we commit your servant into your hands tonight lord we pray dear lord jesus that you will continue to bless him and grant him your wisdom to lead your people to safety to the glory of your holy name oh god that as we leave your presence tonight we shall ponder over this voice that were spoken over this prophet and feed on them lord carry us safely back home and do not let the enemy exploit any of us hide us all securely under the tabernacle of thine mighty wings oh god and let your peace not such as the world gives but such as comes from you abide with us now and forevermore in the mighty name of the lord jesus father we pray we thanksgiving amen amen amen the lord bless you tonight thank you for bringing your lake of fire creating an atmosphere to to be able to help me praise the lord i just i got i got caught in that talk tonight and there was there were some different things i was looking at and i just said well okay we have a little prayer meeting tonight and a little exhortation so i will i will take the opportunity and share that with you you know and and and and sometimes some of the way that we we [Music] you know appreciate the growth of the children is just just engage them in conversation let them be able to express their childlike understanding right to you and sometimes you hear pressures were proceeding from their mouth you realize that they are understanding it in the way of of of their age or their or their state of being but it becomes a blessing praise the lord he realized that uh you know the the the the child was not just did uh uh just dead and their mind wandering away you know the lord bless you let's stand on our feet tonight i hope it was a blessing to you and uh we'll trust the lord for the service on sunday we pray that god will be able to bless the service every promise in the book is mine let's sing there the lord bless you let's let's go in the peace of the lord those that are traveling travel safely we will see you when we get back
