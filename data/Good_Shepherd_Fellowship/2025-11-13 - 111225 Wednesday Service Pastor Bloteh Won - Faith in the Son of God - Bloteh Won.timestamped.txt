[47:43] Let's read from James chapter 5 tonight.
[47:49] James chapter 5
[47:59] to the tech team. I just uh uh send you
[48:04] my
[48:06] my notes I will be using when I got him.
[48:10] So if you if you have not got it just
[48:12] look in the email you see it.
[48:16] Let's read James chapter 5. Tonight is
[48:19] uh
[48:24] let's read from verse 13.
[48:27] Very familiar.
[48:30] Very familiar.
[48:32] Is any among you afflicted? Let him
[48:34] pray. Is any married? Let him sing
[48:37] psalms. Is any sick among you? Let him
[48:41] call for the elders of the church and
[48:45] let them pray over him, anointing him
[48:48] with oil in the name of the Lord. Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; On Sunday, we spoke a little bit on the
[48:56] anointing. The anointing break the
[48:58] yolks. That's one of the reason why I
[49:00] read this scripture tonight. But let's
[49:02] continue. And the prayer of faith shall
[49:05] save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
[49:08] him up. And if he have committed sins,
[49:12] they shall be forgiven him.
[49:16] Praise the Lord.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stop right there. Father, we
[49:22] will ask blessing upon your word
[49:24] tonight. We want to go in the same land
[49:27] of thought
[49:28] uh uh the anointing of the hour that the
[49:32] church has to respond to. So we just
[49:35] pray that you would come and bless us
[49:38] now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. The Lord
[49:42] bless you. You may have your seat.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[49:53] Now, so I want to I want to just uh
[49:57] start up here by reading something to
[50:00] you from uh faith in the son of God.
[50:06] Faith in the son of God. And we'll go
[50:08] into our subject tonight. Good. Good.
[50:11] Good. Faith in the son of God.
[50:17] Now the pastor
[50:19] if if he's not a gifted man or sofa with
[50:24] understanding
[50:26] he did better anoint the man with oil
[50:30] because
[50:32] that's what stands between him and the
[50:36] sickness.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; That's that's one of the main reason why
[50:41] I read that scripture tonight. It is a
[50:44] it's a Bible ordinance. It's a Bible
[50:47] instruction.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Call for the other and let him and and
[50:51] let the sick be anointed with oil. Amen.
[50:54] It stays remain the word of God is
[50:57] remain the truth. But why is it done?
[51:00] Why do we do it? The reason why is there
[51:04] uh uh some time ago one one brother a
[51:07] friend of mine called and he says uh he
[51:09] says brother one do you have anointing
[51:12] oil? I said, "Yes, I do." He says, "I
[51:15] would want some." I says, "For what?" He
[51:18] said, "Well, I I just I just want to
[51:20] have some in my house to, you know, to
[51:22] uh to anoint my home and uh uh I can't
[51:27] remember the details. What for bad
[51:28] dreams
[51:31] and all that, praise the Lord."
[51:34] And I was I was trying to pull his legs
[51:37] a little bit. I says, "Well, the Bible
[51:40] say we must call for the
[51:43] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] I said the Bible says we must call for
[51:48] the elder and uh have you got your other
[51:52] ship yet?
[51:55] Praise the Lord. Now because I say this
[51:58] because uh I mean with uh with uh uh
[52:02] this Laia age is a is a spiritual age.
[52:05] It's a very high religious age. Amen.
[52:09] and uh and and honor that all of these
[52:12] things are done. You know, people just
[52:13] think, you know, you get an anointing
[52:15] oil or you you shake it in the corner of
[52:17] your house and you know, you going to
[52:20] drive demons away or you going to drive
[52:22] evil spirits away. Praise the Lord. I
[52:25] will tell you that those spirits will
[52:27] not go away if there is something in
[52:29] your life that is attracting it.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The spirits just don't
[52:35] come in aboard in our home or in our
[52:38] neighborhood. Is is is the people that
[52:41] attracts it. We have to realize that
[52:45] spirits are spirits and and and uh uh
[52:49] they don't have no ability. They can do
[52:51] nothing until they have a vessel
[52:55] &gt;&gt; to work through.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Until that spirit have
[53:01] a vessel, until that spirit has a nature
[53:04] that it can attach itself to is
[53:07] powerless.
[53:10] Both the spirit of the devil and also
[53:12] the spirit of God.
[53:15] Until the spirit of God has a body that
[53:18] he can work through,
[53:20] he's just going to remain almighty God
[53:23] with all of his power and everything
[53:25] that he can do until he has a vessel
[53:28] that he can work through.
[53:31] Are we together?
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh uh uh uh I I had
[53:40] I had to look for this quickly to just
[53:42] throw it into my my presentation
[53:45] tonight. Uh uh
[53:49] I was talking talking with sister on
[53:52] Sunday and and this came across my mind.
[53:54] So uh I remember it tonight. So I said
[53:57] well okay I know uh used this long time
[54:01] ago now. So the pastor once again if
[54:04] he's not a gifted man or so for with uh
[54:09] understanding he he he did better anoint
[54:12] the man with or because
[54:16] that's what stands between him and and
[54:19] the sickness the the the anointing oil
[54:23] stands between the sick person and the
[54:27] sickness. Praise the Lord.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It also stands between the
[54:31] preacher and the sickness. Are we
[54:33] together?
[54:36] [clears throat]
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Or he could take it himself. Now he
[54:40] takes he takes the order that James gave
[54:44] them the elder of the church and let him
[54:47] anoint him with oil and pray over them.
[54:50] That's exactly the church to anoint with
[54:54] oil. That oil represent the Holy Spirit
[54:57] stands between the pastor and the
[55:00] sickness. That's right. He anoints them
[55:03] with oil representing the Holy Spirit.
[55:06] Just giving over to the Holy Spirit. You
[55:10] are giving the situation over to the
[55:13] Holy Spirit. Amen. Then he prayed for
[55:16] the person. And I have seen it. I have
[55:19] seen it. I've seen uh uh uh uh praying
[55:23] for someone that is sick. I mean, we
[55:26] were one many years ago praying for the
[55:28] sister that was dealing with something.
[55:31] And because of the way that she was
[55:33] moving herself, we had to bring in some
[55:35] of the the sisters, the pastor wife and
[55:38] all of that. And right after their sick,
[55:41] their prayer, the the the brother's wife
[55:44] got so sle. you know, it was just very
[55:47] solid and she she had to be with him for
[55:50] for a while and we knew straight that
[55:52] yeah, that was that was an effect of
[55:55] that. Praise the Lord.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; So, uh I just that is just an appetizer.
[56:02] Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; I just had to go that way tonight so I
[56:07] can I can be able to find where to
[56:09] balance. But uh it's good to be with you
[56:11] tonight. Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[56:16] Good to be with you tonight. So uh uh on
[56:19] uh on Sunday
[56:22] we were talking on the church responding
[56:25] to her anointing.
[56:28] Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; We were talking on the church responding
[56:31] to her anointing. If uh if uh the
[56:35] brothers Emanuel if you can go back to
[56:37] my note on Sunday and uh uh
[56:43] we were talking on the church responding
[56:45] to her anointing
[56:47] and we want to read we want to read uh
[56:50] uh uh the quote that we read there from
[56:53] the fifth seal.
[56:56] Praise the Lord.
[56:59] Amen.
[57:04] I have a portion of it uh drawn with
[57:06] this but I want to go back to there for
[57:10] for some reason [snorts] now
[57:12] [clears throat] from the Phil se this is
[57:13] what we read and that's where our
[57:16] inspiration was from don't forget this
[57:18] church
[57:20] and you brethren on tape I want you to
[57:23] examine this
[57:28] how could a man do anything else beside
[57:30] the power of God that's been released to
[57:34] them. Praise the Lord. How can a man do
[57:39] anything else beside the power of God
[57:41] that been released to them? I'm going to
[57:44] set this box up here to represent that.
[57:49] If God send a certain spirit among them,
[57:53] that's the only thing that they can work
[57:56] by is the spirit that is working among
[58:00] them. Praise the Lord.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Now, we will prove to you by the history
[58:07] of the church and the opening of the
[58:10] seals and the power that is left loose.
[58:14] Now watch exactly the church responding
[58:17] to the anointing and it couldn't do
[58:20] nothing else. Praise the Lord.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:25] So uh uh this this whole thing of uh
[58:29] Revelation 45 and 6 that we've been
[58:32] dwelling on. Like I said, I'm I'm not a
[58:35] teacher. I'm not a teacher. Uh uh so I
[58:40] had uh there there there's a tendency of
[58:43] uh making teaching to preaching and
[58:45] that's what I've been doing because I'm
[58:48] not really staying on the subject to be
[58:50] able to just carry you through like the
[58:53] way a teacher would do it. So uh so I'm
[58:57] sorry I'm doing a very poor job. Praise
[59:00] the Lord. But uh uh I I need to do it
[59:04] because that's where my inspiration is.
[59:07] So I hope that is a blessing to you.
[59:09] Praise the Lord.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; And uh uh down there in um Zimbabwe
[59:15] after after the the meeting
[59:19] uh we preach one of the live message to
[59:21] close the meeting and uh the brother
[59:24] said well brother War is uh you you are
[59:26] a teacher. I said no I'm not a teacher.
[59:29] He says well but what you did was a
[59:30] teacher. I says well I hope you know who
[59:33] a teacher was. Amen. and praise the
[59:35] Lord.
[59:38] So, uh let's uh let's go ahead here.
[59:48] Emmanuel, if you want to put my image
[59:50] up.
[59:57] If you want to put my image up. The one
[59:59] with the power.
[1:00:03] Good. Good, good, good.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6. Let's go back to
[1:00:11] Revelation chapter 6.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Now, so,
[1:00:26] uh, we were we've been dwelling on this
[1:00:28] for a while, a whole while. And and I
[1:00:32] think if I stay more on it, you might
[1:00:34] start seeing it in your dreams.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; And it should not make you afraid with
[1:00:41] everything that we have said about this.
[1:00:43] When you dream about it, it should not
[1:00:44] make you afraid. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh uh these were
[1:00:51] representing the full uh evil power,
[1:00:55] evil beast that is waring against the
[1:00:57] church. If you read uh Revelation
[1:01:00] chapter 9, you will understand that when
[1:01:02] the bottomless pit was open, there was a
[1:01:04] dark smoke that came out of the
[1:01:06] bottomless pit. That was a release of
[1:01:08] demon powers into the earth. So that's
[1:01:10] what this represent. So these are the
[1:01:13] powers. Amen. And uh uh if you also read
[1:01:17] the book of Daniel, you will see where
[1:01:19] Daniel is talking about, you know, the
[1:01:21] the different beasts and different
[1:01:22] powers that that was waring in his age.
[1:01:25] They are all represented here one way or
[1:01:27] the other
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; and these are also the anointing that is
[1:01:31] given to counter this. [snorts] Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; When the enemy come as a floor,
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord will raise up
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; extender.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; So this anointing was the standard of
[1:01:45] God in the church ages.
[1:01:48] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; They were the standard of God in the
[1:01:52] church ages to resist the lies of the
[1:01:55] devil.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; To resist the lies of the devil. Now,
[1:02:02] because if we know how these things
[1:02:05] work, if we know how they work, we will
[1:02:09] know how to be able to to order our
[1:02:14] thoughts.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now take take for
[1:02:20] example the greater battles ever fought.
[1:02:24] The mind is the battleground.
[1:02:26] Are we together?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it is these two powers that
[1:02:32] are waring against our mind.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:43] But what happen is that sometimes we
[1:02:45] blame ourself for those thoughts
[1:02:49] and we don't re really realize that is
[1:02:52] the enemy that is channeling those
[1:02:54] thoughts through our mind.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; So uh uh that's the reason why we want
[1:03:07] to look we want to look at it very
[1:03:09] close. We want to look at it very very
[1:03:12] close. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve. Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful father we
[1:03:38] praise the Lord. Now so we said that uh
[1:03:41] uh there is something I want I want to
[1:03:43] come to tonight
[1:03:45] uh uh because you see our age which is
[1:03:50] under the ego's anointing
[1:03:53] is is a little bit different from the
[1:03:58] rest of these ages.
[1:04:00] Praise the Lord. Okay. All of these
[1:04:04] rainbow color blocks representing the
[1:04:06] seven church ages.
[1:04:08] Our age is a little bit different. And
[1:04:12] and that's what I want us to I want us
[1:04:15] to be able to pay attention to. The
[1:04:17] reason is that
[1:04:20] the reason when Jesus said
[1:04:25] you are in this word but you are not
[1:04:28] part of the word. Praise the Lord. You
[1:04:32] are in this word. You were speaking to
[1:04:33] his disciples but you are not part of
[1:04:36] the word. It kind of describe our age.
[1:04:42] Praise the Lord. Because
[1:04:46] the age in general is the Laudisha
[1:04:50] church age.
[1:04:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:57] And uh uh
[1:05:00] let me see.
[1:05:05] Emmanuel, do we have another block that
[1:05:07] had the church ages name by the side
[1:05:11] in uh in all our pictures?
[1:05:23] Okay. Yeah, let's use this one.
[1:05:26] Yeah, let's use this one
[1:05:30] now. So, uh uh uh
[1:05:33] Okay. Yeah, it comes with the statue of
[1:05:35] the perfect man there now. So, uh
[1:05:42] like I said, our age is a little bit
[1:05:44] different and it's it's beautiful. Yeah,
[1:05:46] let's let's use this one. It's
[1:05:49] beautiful. The anointings are there. The
[1:05:50] messengers are there. The church ages
[1:05:53] are there. Okay, let's deal with this
[1:05:55] now. So, uh
[1:05:59] when we look at this, like I said, the
[1:06:03] lion's anointing
[1:06:06] right here
[1:06:08] operated
[1:06:09] in these three church ages.
[1:06:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It operated in these three church
[1:06:18] ages. the Ephesian
[1:06:22] and the Pagamos church ages were under
[1:06:24] the lion anointing.
[1:06:27] Now under these these uh uh three church
[1:06:32] ages that was where the white horse
[1:06:36] rather ruled.
[1:06:38] Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6. Let's go there.
[1:06:42] Let the picture stay up. Turn to your
[1:06:44] Bible if you have it with you. If not,
[1:06:47] just follow the reading. We'll keep the
[1:06:48] picture up for now. And I saw when the
[1:06:51] lamb opened one of the seal.
[1:06:55] We said on Sunday we will represent the
[1:06:58] lamb because we have the Bible in our
[1:07:00] heads. The Bible represent the book of
[1:07:02] life. The book that was sealed with
[1:07:04] seven seals. So we will represent the
[1:07:07] lamb.
[1:07:09] And then you are John.
[1:07:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; You are John because John represent the
[1:07:17] bride.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together? [snorts]
[1:07:20] [clears throat]
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; So John is the one narrating to us here.
[1:07:24] And I saw when the lamb open one of the
[1:07:26] seal open and he says and I heard as it
[1:07:31] was a noise of thunder
[1:07:34] and one of the four beasts which is one
[1:07:37] of these anointing. Yes.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; And in this in this condition now where
[1:07:43] we are reading it will be the lion
[1:07:45] anointing.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; The lion anointing is the one now that
[1:07:52] is saying one of the four beast saying
[1:07:54] come and see. Praise the Lord. Amen. So
[1:08:00] uh uh this beast is calling to you John
[1:08:06] to come and see what I have open.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; The lamb has the book open.
[1:08:16] And this anointing is calling to the
[1:08:20] church to come and see
[1:08:23] what is on this seal. Are we together?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh here here is the
[1:08:30] principle that that is lying in there
[1:08:32] that actually you cannot see when Jesus
[1:08:36] said the devil comes to steal, kill and
[1:08:39] destroy. There is no way you can be able
[1:08:43] to identify it in your age until you
[1:08:46] have heard the voice of your anointing
[1:08:50] that is saying come and see.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:59] As humans, there is no way we can be
[1:09:02] able to identify the working of the
[1:09:05] devil.
[1:09:09] I will tell you tonight that there are
[1:09:11] even things that war in our life that we
[1:09:15] can attribute to the devil because of
[1:09:18] the way uh uh the nature of that thing
[1:09:22] is. But actually when you when when when
[1:09:24] you really look at it through the eyes
[1:09:27] of your messenger, he will tell you that
[1:09:30] it's your family strain.
[1:09:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; He will tell you that it's your family
[1:09:38] strain. And and some of these family
[1:09:40] strain that we deal with in our life,
[1:09:43] they are things that we will have to
[1:09:45] keep under the blood.
[1:09:48] We will have to keep like like brother
[1:09:50] Brandham says, we will have to keep IT
[1:09:52] ON THE PRAYERS BECAUSE THOSE are the
[1:09:55] areas where the devil has the right to
[1:09:57] hit you.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; We will have to keep it on our prayers
[1:10:07] and and and and for some of us it will
[1:10:10] be until we get a body change.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Until we get a body change.
[1:10:24] Now, so that is the thing that is
[1:10:26] important because you see there is there
[1:10:29] the the church in many ways uh uh uh you
[1:10:32] know uh uh believing in God. Where did I
[1:10:35] put my mark now? Okay,
[1:10:38] let me open my hand. Okay, have it right
[1:10:40] here. Now the church in many ways
[1:10:45] it brings us to the place where
[1:10:47] sometimes we we we get frustrated.
[1:10:52] Amen. Now take this even with the
[1:10:56] apostle Paul
[1:10:58] that that familiar scripture my grace is
[1:11:02] sufficient
[1:11:04] my strength is made perfect in your
[1:11:07] weakness.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that what
[1:11:14] Paul was referring to that the Lord told
[1:11:16] him his grace was sufficient is because
[1:11:19] Paul had an eye problem.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; It was not something that he was born
[1:11:25] with. It was something that affected his
[1:11:28] eyes from the light of the pillow of
[1:11:31] fire.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God uh humbling that educated h
[1:11:42] jewel that that that young jewel boy
[1:11:44] that was so zillious. God way of
[1:11:48] humbling him was to be able to affect
[1:11:51] him. I mean HE SAW THE LIGHT uh uh
[1:11:54] shining so bright and he could even
[1:11:57] identify it scripturally when he SAID
[1:11:59] LORD
[1:12:01] WHO ART THOU?
[1:12:03] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And he heard the very name that he was
[1:12:08] he was uh persecuting. I'm Jesus.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:17] I call him to the testimony. Paul got
[1:12:21] blind. He was led.
[1:12:25] The book of Acts says they led him by
[1:12:27] the hands and and and and and God had to
[1:12:30] tell Ananas to go and meet Paul
[1:12:33] somewhere. He's blind. I just blinded
[1:12:36] him. Go and meet him. Ananas said,
[1:12:38] "Well, I've heard that that is the man
[1:12:39] that is persecuting the church." God
[1:12:41] said, "Don't worry. That one I've
[1:12:42] already knocked him off." Amen.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't be afraid. I've
[1:12:48] already knocked that one. He's one of us
[1:12:49] now.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; So, Ananas went prayed for him. He
[1:12:54] received his sight.
[1:12:58] But the eyes still have problem.
[1:13:03] And until he died, he never got healing
[1:13:09] to his eyes.
[1:13:11] The more he prayed about it, the more it
[1:13:13] bother him. In one of his writing, he
[1:13:16] said, "I even had to write with big
[1:13:18] letters
[1:13:20] because of my eyes."
[1:13:24] Are we together?
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; But you see, that never had anything to
[1:13:28] do with the Holy Ghost. He had
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; that never had anything to do with his
[1:13:32] new birth.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; That never had anything to do with what
[1:13:36] God was doing in his life. Even with THE
[1:13:38] EYE PROBLEM, PAUL WAS UH I mean he was
[1:13:42] he was he was uh uh uh uh bold to stand
[1:13:45] in THE SYNAGOGUE. EVERY GIVEN
[1:13:47] OPPORTUNITY.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Every giving opportunity.
[1:13:56] Are we together? Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; So you see, we cannot be able to rightly
[1:14:02] identify the working of the devil.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Remember now, Hebrew chapter 4:12 tells
[1:14:10] us that the word of God is sharper
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; like a two-edged sword. And what it does
[1:14:16] is that it counts
[1:14:19] and it separate. It goes at the dividing
[1:14:23] sunder of your soul and your spirit.
[1:14:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was I was looking at there today
[1:14:32] and it's it's very beautiful. I was I
[1:14:35] was actually looking at there today and
[1:14:37] uh uh uh
[1:14:44] are we together?
[1:14:51] Sometimes that's what happen when uh
[1:14:55] when it's not exactly what you want to
[1:14:56] preach, but because you were studying
[1:14:58] it, it has a way of coming back to haunt
[1:15:00] you. Uh uh Matthew chapter 22. Let's go
[1:15:03] there quickly.
[1:15:05] Let's go there quickly.
[1:15:07] Another time when I'm speaking on it,
[1:15:09] you will know exactly what I'm talking
[1:15:10] about.
[1:15:17] Are we together?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Matthew 22
[1:15:21] uh verse 34. But when the Pharisees
[1:15:24] heard that he had put the Sadducees to
[1:15:26] Silence, they were gathered together.
[1:15:30] Then one of them which was a lawyer
[1:15:33] which mean a student of the word that
[1:15:35] what it means a lawyer somebody that is
[1:15:38] a student of the word ask him a question
[1:15:41] tempting him and saying master which is
[1:15:44] the greatest commandment
[1:15:47] in the Lord.
[1:15:49] Are we together?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Now follow this. Now Jesus said unto
[1:15:53] him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:15:58] with all thine heart,
[1:16:02] and with all thy soul, and with all thy
[1:16:06] mind." Praise the Lord.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; The mind here will be the same as your
[1:16:12] spirit. The mind and the spirit, Paul
[1:16:16] used that
[1:16:19] interchangeably.
[1:16:20] Are we together? Amen.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, love the Lord with all of your
[1:16:25] heart. Love the Lord with all of your
[1:16:28] soul. Love the Lord with all of your
[1:16:31] mind, all of your spirit.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] The the
[1:16:49] spirit is willing and the flesh is weak.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; That was a statement that came in the
[1:16:56] temptation of Jesus
[1:16:59] when he told the disciples to pray.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; And because all hell was against what
[1:17:07] was happening, the disciples couldn't
[1:17:10] even find strength to pray.
[1:17:13] Are we together?
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; They couldn't find strength to pray.
[1:17:19] Now
[1:17:21] the question there was that the
[1:17:26] why why I'm coming in here so you can
[1:17:27] see is that uh uh uh Jesus he's using
[1:17:34] this verse from from from Moses and and
[1:17:37] and and he's trying to make us to see
[1:17:39] something. Love the Lord with all of
[1:17:41] your heart, all of your soul and all of
[1:17:44] your spirit.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Now, so it's in a place that when your
[1:17:54] flesh is weak,
[1:17:57] it does not change the love of God that
[1:17:59] is in your soul.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; When you're bothered, when when when you
[1:18:08] are affected, when when you are on a
[1:18:10] depression or you are worrying, your
[1:18:12] spirit is affected. You are worrying,
[1:18:15] you are trouble in your spirit. And do
[1:18:17] not change the love of God in your soul.
[1:18:20] Because Paul tells us in ROMANS CHAPTER
[1:18:23] FIVE THAT THE LOVE of God, Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; He says the love of God is brought about
[1:18:32] by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; In our soul.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; This is beautiful.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. when we look at it together here.
[1:18:48] So he said, "Love the Lord with all of
[1:18:49] your heart, all of your soul, all of
[1:18:51] your mind. This is the first and the
[1:18:55] great commandment."
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I was studying this today, but I was
[1:19:01] looking at it on a different subject.
[1:19:04] But this is what I learned as I was as I
[1:19:07] was studying the scripture
[1:19:09] right here. This is where Jesus divided
[1:19:13] the ten commandments into two.
[1:19:17] When you read all the Mark or Luke
[1:19:19] account, Jesus says uh the ten
[1:19:22] commandment they are just two. Love the
[1:19:25] law with all of your heart and love your
[1:19:27] neighbors as yourself. And when you look
[1:19:30] at the way the ten commandments is
[1:19:33] listed, the first four commandments
[1:19:36] have to do with loving the Lord.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The first four commandments have to do
[1:19:44] not worship any graven image. Do not do
[1:19:47] not bow down to them. Do not take the
[1:19:50] Lord your God the name of the the Lord
[1:19:52] your God in vain. And the fourth one is
[1:19:55] that honor the Sabbath.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; ALL OF THAT HAVE to do with the Lord.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; And he called that the great comming.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And the second he says here,
[1:20:13] [clears throat]
[1:20:15] "And the second is likely unto this." is
[1:20:19] likely unto this. Meaning that from the
[1:20:23] the the the fifth COMMANDMENT COMING
[1:20:26] DOWN, EVERY one of them are likely. They
[1:20:28] have to do with somebody. They have to
[1:20:31] do with your neighbors.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; The fifth commandment, honor your or
[1:20:37] your father and your mother. They are
[1:20:38] your neighbor. They are your closest
[1:20:40] neighbors.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; The next one, do not steal. DO NOT BEAR
[1:20:46] FALSE WITNESS. I mean, do not ste is
[1:20:48] it's your neighbor. Do not bear force
[1:20:50] when against your neighbor. So it has to
[1:20:52] do with people and what I learned in
[1:20:55] this is that what I learned in this
[1:21:01] there was nothing part of this tonight
[1:21:03] but I don't know how I got there
[1:21:06] but what I learned in this is they are
[1:21:08] there the the the the the second
[1:21:10] commandment
[1:21:13] hallelujah
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; they are six
[1:21:17] four have to do with the Lord your God.
[1:21:21] The six has to do with loving your
[1:21:25] neighbors as yourself. Are we together?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Six is the number of men.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; So there ARE PEOPLE WITHOUT THE HOLY
[1:21:36] Ghost that can keep the rest of the six.
[1:21:41] There are people that are not born
[1:21:42] again. They love their parents. They
[1:21:45] honor their parents.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:50] Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; They don't GO TO CHURCH, BUT THEY WILL
[1:21:53] NOT STEAL from their neighbor.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; THEY WON'T BEAR FALSE WITNESS.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JESUS said they are likely
[1:22:05] like this. They are connected.
[1:22:09] They have to do with the people around
[1:22:11] you. They have to DO WITH YOUR
[1:22:13] ENVIRONMENT. WHY THE FIRST FOUR HAVE TO
[1:22:16] DO with
[1:22:18] the supernatural?
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; You need God
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; to honor the first four.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You need to be born again.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; You need a revelation to honor THE
[1:22:32] SABBATH
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; HONORING THE SABBATH IS PUTTING GOD
[1:22:40] FIRST.
[1:22:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; SO THE WORD OF GOD IS SHARPER THAN THE
[1:22:51] TWO EDGES SWORE. So when the word comes
[1:22:54] in your life, when the word is revealed
[1:22:57] to you,
[1:23:01] it goes and it divide
[1:23:05] gets to the divide in the sunder of your
[1:23:08] soul and your spirit.
[1:23:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Your your soul is u is a it's a home IS
[1:23:21] IT'S A DWELLING place for the word.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; It's a dwelling place.
[1:23:33] The word gets right in there. David will
[1:23:36] say, "Restore my soul."
[1:23:40] Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; The word goes in there your soul to
[1:23:45] bring true consciousness of God to you.
[1:23:52] Are we together?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; A person spirit can comes on an
[1:24:02] influence of the word. They can become
[1:24:04] religious but they never receive a birth
[1:24:08] in their soul. Yes,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; they are going to be religious and still
[1:24:14] have an animal nature
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; right in the face of the word of God.
[1:24:21] They can do the most craziest thing
[1:24:26] because their soul is not delivered.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] That's why I was coming to when I says
[1:24:38] our age is a little bit different. The
[1:24:41] reason why I say that is because this
[1:24:44] age is harvest time.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; This is the age of the fullness.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; We cannot play religion under the
[1:24:54] message. We can't be religious under the
[1:24:56] message. We can't play church under the
[1:24:59] message because the word has come to
[1:25:02] deal with us face to face.
[1:25:05] The word has come to bring us reality.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And if we get serious with THE WORD,
[1:25:15] WE'RE GOING to know ourself.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; WE WILL KNOW OURSELF. WE WILL UNDERSTAND
[1:25:22] OURSELF. We will be able to see WHAT THE
[1:25:25] GRACE OF GOD IS DOING. YOU WILL YOU WILL
[1:25:27] SEE THE DIVIDING, the thunder. You will
[1:25:29] see the grace of God dealing with your
[1:25:31] soul, changing your life. You will SEE
[1:25:34] THE THINGS THAT YOU have to war with in
[1:25:36] your spirit.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; So that's why I said our age is a little
[1:26:01] bit different. So the lion anointing had
[1:26:03] to war against it has to battle yet in
[1:26:06] these in these three church ages. Yeah.
[1:26:09] The deed the deed of the nickelian was
[1:26:11] was introduced in this in this age here.
[1:26:14] It just started as a deed as a as a good
[1:26:17] thought good good intention.
[1:26:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:23] Good intention.
[1:26:27] We we just need to have some choirs, you
[1:26:29] know. Everybody can sing. So, let's
[1:26:32] let's just pay some people to train
[1:26:34] their voice. I mean, they would do the
[1:26:36] singing for us because when we singing,
[1:26:39] we just out of tone.
[1:26:41] Out of tone.
[1:26:44] That's Doesn't that sound nice?
[1:26:48] Praise the Lord. We out of tune. We
[1:26:50] can't even clap our hands straight.
[1:26:53] The musicians, they playing one thing.
[1:26:55] The singers are singing another thing.
[1:26:58] Sometime I don't even know if I'm host
[1:27:00] or my voice is clear. Praise. Good idea.
[1:27:05] Good idea.
[1:27:07] And pretty soon, oh wow. Yeah,
[1:27:10] we will pay them. We will pay them. We
[1:27:13] will pay them. They will dedicate
[1:27:14] themselves to to training to singing,
[1:27:17] you know. Uh they will do the worship.
[1:27:23] And that was not just the wound thing.
[1:27:27] They were taking away this this the
[1:27:29] liberty of the spirit from the people.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; They were bounding the people and the
[1:27:33] people never knew that. They were making
[1:27:36] them cold to just come and sit down and
[1:27:39] become spectator.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; And they didn't know that.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; It came in very that's a good idea.
[1:27:50] That's a good thought.
[1:27:53] Praise the Lord. Why if you go in the
[1:27:55] desert, you you you you save somebody in
[1:27:58] the desert and and there is no water for
[1:28:00] you to baptize them. What are you going
[1:28:03] to do?
[1:28:05] Well, you can just take water from your
[1:28:07] camper and just bring it over their
[1:28:08] head. That will be easy.
[1:28:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:16] THE GOD THAT OPENED THE RED Sea
[1:28:19] and cause A PATH THROUGH THE RED SEA,
[1:28:23] can he open the desert and put water
[1:28:25] there?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And one need to be baptized.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; But you see, all of those ideas,
[1:28:35] they came across slowly and the church
[1:28:38] embraced him.
[1:28:44] And as the people embraced him is is
[1:28:47] slowly drive the spirit away.
[1:28:53] And that's what Paul was dealing with in
[1:28:56] this age.
[1:28:58] When you real when you read church
[1:29:00] history, you realize that uh when Paul
[1:29:03] right there in in Rome
[1:29:10] when the Roman church because there were
[1:29:12] two churches in Rome.
[1:29:15] There were two churches in Rome there.
[1:29:16] There was there was the the Roman church
[1:29:19] and there was a small group of believers
[1:29:23] that choose to stay with the apostle
[1:29:25] teaching.
[1:29:28] Praise the Lord. The ones that were
[1:29:30] known or called to be fanatics
[1:29:36] And these other ones, they were happy
[1:29:39] because uh I mean h a big men of the
[1:29:42] Roman government is now coming to their
[1:29:44] churches.
[1:29:48] Did you hear that? Uh h
[1:29:52] you know uh the the the the centtorum
[1:29:55] from from uh uh you know uh uh
[1:30:00] what's the bless name? He's he he I
[1:30:03] heard he will be in church. Constantine
[1:30:05] invited him.
[1:30:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:14] So now that that church that was looking
[1:30:16] like just like an old struggling church,
[1:30:19] now they have big men associated with
[1:30:21] them and and you know and and then the
[1:30:23] status go. But then the thing also is
[1:30:25] that you can't sit down beside the big
[1:30:27] men. So all of you people that are
[1:30:29] little class, y'all go back.
[1:30:32] You leave the front seat for the
[1:30:35] generous and the the big people
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; dividing
[1:30:46] and then that just how it started
[1:30:48] creeping in the church. So Paul, this
[1:30:50] anointing of uh of Paul teaching how to
[1:30:54] fight against this in these three church
[1:30:58] ages.
[1:31:01] But we will learn from Revelation
[1:31:03] chapter 6 that the the the the deed got
[1:31:08] a crown.
[1:31:10] So that doctrine, trinitarian doctrine
[1:31:13] was crowned right here. And when it got
[1:31:15] a crown, IT HAS SO MUCH POWER TO DO
[1:31:19] WHAT? Move to the next edge and create
[1:31:22] death.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And sometimes that is
[1:31:29] the same thing that the enemy tried to
[1:31:31] bring to us. You know, he tried to give
[1:31:33] us reason to, you know, to relax, not to
[1:31:36] just be, I mean, overzeilious. And he he
[1:31:38] just tried to take all your little
[1:31:40] spirituality away from you. And before
[1:31:43] you realize you are spiritually dead,
[1:31:53] the thing that will move your heart uh
[1:31:55] uh WITH GOD IN PRAYER AND AND AND and I
[1:31:59] mean when it used to be before you fell
[1:32:01] empty and you FELL BACKSLIDING IN YOUR
[1:32:04] WAYS, you would cry to God. It's no
[1:32:07] longer there.
[1:32:12] Everything that is just reasoning in
[1:32:14] your mind.
[1:32:16] Are we together?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; When it got a crown year, it moved here
[1:32:22] and it became death. Let's go. Let's go.
[1:32:26] Go change the picture. Now go over to to
[1:32:28] our quote on the fifth seal. If you have
[1:32:31] it,
[1:32:33] let's read a little bit. I want to I
[1:32:36] want I want to pick up something.
[1:32:39] It's 9:00. I should be closing.
[1:32:43] Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I will just read there.
[1:32:54] Okay, I'll go ahead and they will catch
[1:32:57] up with us.
[1:33:00] Watch us exactly like the church
[1:33:01] responding
[1:33:04] to the anointing and they couldn't do
[1:33:06] nothing else. Now the first was that
[1:33:10] lion that ro pure unadulterated word.
[1:33:15] The second interior was the ox anointing
[1:33:20] the burden a beast of burden pardon me
[1:33:23] it it was u also a a sacrificial beast
[1:33:29] and wasn't that exactly the poor little
[1:33:32] church Rome have settled down there to a
[1:33:36] thousand years of dark age and and
[1:33:39] anything that didn't profess to be a
[1:33:43] Roman church was put under death
[1:33:46] immediately.
[1:33:48] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; That's under the second church age.
[1:33:54] Now the third beast that went forth
[1:33:59] that went out
[1:34:01] from the devil was this black her say
[1:34:05] see and the ter beast that went out a
[1:34:09] power
[1:34:10] from God to combat him to combat the
[1:34:15] power of the black horse was a man
[1:34:19] praise the lord
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; so we realize here the man's anoint
[1:34:23] anointing went out.
[1:34:25] Okay, that's right. So, the man
[1:34:28] anointing went out and uh it was
[1:34:31] cunning. It was smart with the wisdom of
[1:34:34] God. Now, that's that's that just where
[1:34:37] I want to get you get you told tonight
[1:34:40] because honor the man's anointing. You
[1:34:42] see what brother Brandham say was
[1:34:44] cooling. It was smart with the wisdom of
[1:34:46] God. You know, a man is is smarter than
[1:34:50] any of the beast. See he's he is smarter
[1:34:53] because he can outweight him mostly.
[1:34:57] He's coning his truth. See now so you
[1:34:59] will realize that it was under this age
[1:35:03] that the printing press started.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; It was under this age
[1:35:16] that they started writing the Bible.
[1:35:18] They started printing the Bible. So, so
[1:35:22] honor this age
[1:35:25] these people are responding to their
[1:35:27] age.
[1:35:29] So, honor the age and MAN GETS AN IDEA
[1:35:33] to start the printing press.
[1:35:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Now, it looks common,
[1:35:40] but it is God's way of fortifying his
[1:35:43] church.
[1:35:45] WHY? BECAUSE NOW THE BIBLE IS GOING TO
[1:35:48] BE PRINTED. THE BIBLE IS GOING TO BE
[1:35:50] DISTRIBUTE.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; DISTRIBUTED. And now the believers will
[1:35:56] have direct access to the WORD TO BE
[1:35:59] ABLE TO STAND AGAINST the Catholic
[1:36:01] doctrine.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. IF THE BIBLE WAS NOT PRINTED,
[1:36:08] THERE IS NO WAY THAT LUTHER WILL HAVE
[1:36:10] come out against the Catholic Church to
[1:36:13] say the just shall live by faith
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHY? IT WAS JUST IN THE HANDS of
[1:36:20] the Catholic priest.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; He was just telling the church and in
[1:36:25] some places he read he reads in Latin
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; when he don't even understand Latin.
[1:36:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; He taught to read in Latin but never
[1:36:37] taught to understand what he's reading.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; A brother there in in uh in uh uh uh I
[1:36:49] think St. Louis, uh, Missouri. Uh,
[1:36:52] brother brother James Miller's son,
[1:36:54] brother Tim, they have a they have a
[1:36:56] church there and uh, they they are
[1:36:58] beginning to to to have lot of
[1:37:04] uh, Amish people,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; lot of Amish people coming out of that
[1:37:11] movement. And now why? Because they have
[1:37:15] got a hold of the Bible.
[1:37:20] Because the Bible that they are reading
[1:37:22] to them is in a old German language
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; in an old German language.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; So whatever the man reads and tell you
[1:37:33] that's what it means, that's what you
[1:37:35] believe
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; because you don't know how to read it.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. a year now. These these
[1:37:43] Amish people uh uh one of one of the the
[1:37:46] the the
[1:37:48] man and his wife came to the meeting
[1:37:50] there in enforcement uh with brother
[1:37:53] Prader, brother Prader meeting. They
[1:37:55] drove down with uh uh brother Nis and
[1:37:58] his family and and you know Tim was
[1:38:01] testifying to me how you know they are
[1:38:03] having Bible studies and these people
[1:38:05] are just asking question. You can just
[1:38:08] see the hunger in them. It looks like
[1:38:10] they HAVE BEEN STARVED ALL of these
[1:38:11] years
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; and now they are exposed to the Bible
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; and now they are realizing that what
[1:38:19] they've been telling them in Germany is
[1:38:21] a lie.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; So as much as IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS A
[1:38:28] PHYSICAL thing
[1:38:30] the opening of the printing press but
[1:38:32] that was God's way that was God's power
[1:38:35] that was the beast of the age. So the
[1:38:37] men of that age was responding.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord. Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And if you were if you will have good
[1:38:47] Bible literature,
[1:38:49] if you read books
[1:38:52] of of of people from from that time, the
[1:38:55] the 18th century, you say, "Wow."
[1:39:00] Because you you you could tell that they
[1:39:02] were touching something.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would you could tell there that
[1:39:09] I mean like h
[1:39:11] Charles Lying the one that uh you know
[1:39:14] people uh uh since oh brother Brandon
[1:39:16] copy from here and that that's the age
[1:39:18] that he came from.
[1:39:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:24] If you read your books I'm not a good
[1:39:26] reader but I have I love books.
[1:39:30] So I have I have them. I have them and
[1:39:32] and and and I like when I get inside
[1:39:35] you, you just see that. Oh my God.
[1:39:39] It was not the time for the opening of
[1:39:42] the word. But those men were in the
[1:39:44] word.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Because it is God that gives revelation.
[1:39:49] You don't get revelation by learning,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; but you could tell that they were in the
[1:39:54] word.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; God. Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:00] Because I mean they will bring types and
[1:40:02] shadow out for you. You will say, "Oh my
[1:40:04] god.
[1:40:06] Oh my god."
[1:40:09] Are we together?
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] So, I'll stop right here. And uh but
[1:40:16] what where I wanted to go with this is
[1:40:18] to allow us to see that uh the man's
[1:40:22] anointing
[1:40:25] the man's anointing.
[1:40:31] Let's let's drop down and read read a
[1:40:33] little bit and I close here. that age
[1:40:35] from the dark age coming out to the dark
[1:40:38] age. Now the other side
[1:40:41] when this when this black horse was
[1:40:44] riding when when they charge their their
[1:40:49] sacrifices and everything they done the
[1:40:52] money and money. Oh you know that now
[1:40:55] the next thing that went out to combat
[1:40:58] that was the beast with the face of a
[1:41:01] man smart educated fine anointed with
[1:41:04] that spirit of the dead. You notice it
[1:41:08] now. He went he went to combat with the
[1:41:12] holiness of God's wisdom.
[1:41:15] So first see it was the reformer
[1:41:18] zingling all
[1:41:22] who are not scavening and and all of
[1:41:24] those men they were all under the the
[1:41:27] the man's anointing. So you see that's
[1:41:31] the reason why when they started their
[1:41:33] movement their movement started on the
[1:41:36] base of the word but when the men died
[1:41:40] the denominated
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and went back
[1:41:43] praise the lord
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; so the man's anointing went all the way
[1:41:49] to Pentecost
[1:41:52] the man's anointing
[1:41:55] went all the way to Pentecost went all
[1:41:57] the way to Laia
[1:42:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I will leave you right here tonight. So
[1:42:06] So when I pick it up, I'll be able to
[1:42:08] have enough comfort to pick up to go
[1:42:11] right into the ego's anointing because
[1:42:13] because you we will we will learn from
[1:42:16] the word that the eagle's anointing
[1:42:19] really didn't start with uh uh uh the
[1:42:22] Laudisha church age. The Eagle's
[1:42:25] anointing started way with
[1:42:29] 1963, the opening of the seal.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the reason why I I want to
[1:42:42] bring this is because this will help you
[1:42:45] to understand that uh uh all of the
[1:42:50] things that we try to major major on
[1:42:53] our dress code and and all of those
[1:42:56] things you will realize that they will
[1:42:58] all stay still under the man's
[1:43:00] anointing.
[1:43:03] Baptism in Jesus name. It was not the
[1:43:06] opening of the seals that brought it.
[1:43:08] Pentecostal were baptizing in Jesus
[1:43:11] name,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; believing one God. It was not an opening
[1:43:14] of the seals that brought it.
[1:43:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:22] So you see all of these things we we try
[1:43:24] to measure on and and and we think it is
[1:43:27] the message. We think it is the message.
[1:43:30] It's all under the man's anointing.
[1:43:35] The ego's anointing COMES UP TO SHOW YOU
[1:43:38] YOUR PLACE in God.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; IT COMES TO SHOW YOU YOUR PLACE, YOUR
[1:43:45] PURPOSE, YOUR CALLING. IT HAVE TO DO
[1:43:48] WITH YOU. AMEN.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; It it does NOT HAVE TO DO WITH YOU h
[1:43:56] obeying one certain doctrine
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; because all of these things that men
[1:44:01] that men strive to make doctrine of they
[1:44:04] were all under the man's anointing.
[1:44:07] All of these men they held to those
[1:44:09] things strongly.
[1:44:12] Praise the Lord. Even till now some very
[1:44:16] good oneness
[1:44:18] Pentecostal church you get there I mean
[1:44:21] those sisters uh from up down completely
[1:44:26] the look decent some of our sister WILL
[1:44:29] EVEN LOOK WALL ammon
[1:44:34] praise the lord
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; so it is not in the dress code it is not
[1:44:40] in it I'm I'm I'm not playing on that
[1:44:42] I'm not saying Because the revelation of
[1:44:44] the word, you knowing your place in God.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; You don't need a preacher to tell you to
[1:44:49] dread this.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; You don't need a preacher.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; And and and it's because of that
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; THAT WE HAVE GIVEN OURSELF AND GIVING
[1:45:00] THE pulpit to people that come, they
[1:45:02] just they just insult the bride
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; when the bride supposed to be showing
[1:45:07] hopeless in the word.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:15] When brother Brandon was under the gift
[1:45:17] of an evangelist, he was out in the
[1:45:20] denomination
[1:45:23] calling calling the bride out.
[1:45:27] But where where is our evangelist?
[1:45:30] They are in they are in the bride. How
[1:45:33] can you evangelize the bride?
[1:45:36] How can you evangelize the bride?
[1:45:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; No, the bride don't need to be
[1:45:44] evangelized. The bride needs to be shown
[1:45:47] her position.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:53] So in many in many sense in a very broad
[1:45:56] way we have gifts that are out OF PLACE
[1:45:59] BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS there the as
[1:46:02] the people are shown their position. If
[1:46:05] uh if if an evangelist comes he has a
[1:46:08] gift and his gift is to rebuke sin. HIS
[1:46:12] GIFT IS TO CALL THE PEOPLE out but not
[1:46:15] in the pride.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; So what is what is what what is what
[1:46:22] what what is going to happen is that he
[1:46:24] takes the pulpit. Now I'm not I'm not
[1:46:27] casting down evangelism. No, you know we
[1:46:29] bring preachers through. I'm just trying
[1:46:31] to tell you where we are.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Because a brother could come and he's
[1:46:41] anointed, he has a message, he can come
[1:46:43] and preach and before you realize you
[1:46:46] start looking for something in your life
[1:46:47] that is not there.
[1:46:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Because that gift is rebuking sin. It's
[1:46:57] telling you clean your life. Is telling
[1:46:58] you check your life. And then you goes
[1:47:00] back again when when actually you're
[1:47:02] supposed to be going forward.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:11] Remember
[1:47:15] brother Brandham says when the bride
[1:47:17] find her place
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; the rapture we go.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the reason why when you
[1:47:26] watch many of the brothers, I've watched
[1:47:28] them, brother Dale Smith, brother
[1:47:31] brother Daryl Ward and many many many
[1:47:34] evangelists they comes to the pulpit
[1:47:37] they preach even like brother brother
[1:47:40] forest farmer that came and preached for
[1:47:42] us.
[1:47:43] You're listening to that message does
[1:47:45] not even looks like an evangelist
[1:47:46] preaching.
[1:47:49] Why? because their gift is responding to
[1:47:53] our position.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; When the church is in the word, when the
[1:47:58] church is desiring to go higher, YOU
[1:48:01] CREATE THE DEMAND WHAT THE PREACHER MUST
[1:48:03] PREACH.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; The preacher can come with his message.
[1:48:08] I'm going to blast this. You demand.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST LIKE YOU GO YOU GO OVER to the
[1:48:16] restaurant to eat. I don't force you to
[1:48:18] eat to say, "Look, this is what I have.
[1:48:20] You have to eat it."
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; No, you tell me what you want to eat.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; It is MY DUTY TO GET BEHIND THERE AND
[1:48:26] fix it.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Or else you say I I leave from here.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; I don't tell you say it's all meal we
[1:48:33] have for dinner.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; That old meal we have.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; You say I want steak. I say it's all
[1:48:39] meal that we have.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Sit down and eat the old meal.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's the way we preachers we
[1:48:50] are.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; When the when when the desire in the
[1:48:54] people is to go up higher.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Then we say, let's come to fast and
[1:49:00] pray.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Let's fast AND PRAY. FAST. LET'S fast
[1:49:03] and pray.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Now, be careful. I'm not
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not kicking those things out of the
[1:49:11] church,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; but it is you
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; that create the demand.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; It is your position.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Where you are in your walk with God.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; So, the bride is responding to her
[1:49:28] anointing
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; and she cannot do anything else.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is the same thing when
[1:49:33] this church is anointed with people that
[1:49:36] are praying and reading the word.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Any preacher that comes behind you,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; he will have to respond to our
[1:49:42] anointing.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; You see the picture?
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and pray.
[1:50:04] Dear father, we just want to thank you
[1:50:06] tonight. Lord,
[1:50:08] thought that Lord God, we must labor on
[1:50:11] this a little bit just to be able to
[1:50:14] help your people to grab the picture.
[1:50:16] Like I said, not [clears throat] being a
[1:50:19] teacher, Lord. Father, I take these
[1:50:21] things into preaching, but Father God,
[1:50:24] uh coming over it one second time and
[1:50:27] the third time, the people might grab
[1:50:29] it. It might get clearer today. Father,
[1:50:32] it might get clearer today. Brother
[1:50:34] Brandham told us it's not the preacher
[1:50:36] that brings the revival to time. He said
[1:50:39] it's the people.
[1:50:41] He said it's the people that has the
[1:50:42] revival. So many times we have preachers
[1:50:46] they come and preach. We say oh wow I
[1:50:48] enjoyed I enjoyed the brother. Yeah we
[1:50:52] enjoy him because he yielded to the Holy
[1:50:54] Ghost. But you are the one that create
[1:50:56] the atmosphere.
[1:50:59] You are the one that has the anointing.
[1:51:03] And that's the reason why when we come
[1:51:05] to church we are down. [music] We are we
[1:51:07] are distracted and and and uh we are not
[1:51:11] prayed up and we not ready for the word
[1:51:13] and we are not worshiping.
[1:51:16] You are detecting [music] how the
[1:51:18] service must go.
[1:51:25] Heavenly Father, [music]
[1:51:28] precious Lord, we we just pray to God.
[1:51:30] Father Lord, as we say over over and
[1:51:34] over, Father God, Lord, we we want to
[1:51:36] labor for the atmosphere that word in
[1:51:38] this place where we come together,
[1:51:40] Father Lord, [music] we have our little
[1:51:42] children that needs the Holy Ghost. We
[1:51:44] have our young people that are dealing
[1:51:46] with peer pressure, Father God, in
[1:51:48] different things. Lord, we want to labor
[1:51:51] for the right atmosphere. Lord,
[1:51:55] we want to come to service with a ready
[1:51:57] mind. We want to come to service and
[1:52:00] say, "Lord,
[1:52:01] lift me up.
[1:52:04] I want to be lifted up on higher
[1:52:05] ground."
[1:52:11] Not just only waiting for what the
[1:52:13] preacher will bring, but we want to come
[1:52:15] with our heart tonight. I really want to
[1:52:18] be fed.
[1:52:20] I want the word to be preached where I
[1:52:21] can I can draw some faith from the word.
[1:52:29] We love you tonight. We thank you for
[1:52:30] what your grace is doing, Lord. Father,
[1:52:32] [music and singing] in our midst,
[1:52:34] Father, Lord, I pray you take your
[1:52:36] people home safely tonight. [music]
[1:52:38] We thank you. We love you, Father.
[1:52:42] In Jesus [music] name we pray.
[1:52:44] Amen.

[1:52:49] there tonight.
