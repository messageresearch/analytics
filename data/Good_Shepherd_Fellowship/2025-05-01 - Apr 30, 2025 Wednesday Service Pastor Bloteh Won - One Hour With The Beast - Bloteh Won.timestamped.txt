[41:02] Praise the

[41:10] serve.
[41:13] Amen.
[41:22] Amen. I was looking at uh uh two two
[41:26] scriptures tonight. Uh but uh let's
[41:29] let's just read Revelation chapter 17.
[41:31] And that's what I want to I want to read
[41:36] from. Let's read Revelation chapter
[41:40] 17. I took a while to come up out there
[41:44] because I was
[41:46] uh I thought I've added certain things
[41:48] to my notes, but I realized that I
[41:52] didn't. And I was trying to get a hold
[41:54] of faith and I just couldn't get a hold
[41:56] of faith. So it took me a while
[41:59] to to step out. I think uh
[42:05] brother Lawrence led us in songs and the
[42:09] atmosphere was ready for me to come out
[42:11] and I was wasting time. So uh Revelation
[42:15] chapter 17. Let's just go back there. Um
[42:20] this is something that I've I've spoken
[42:21] here before but
[42:24] uh I will
[42:29] I just want to use it uh tonight based
[42:32] on what we were talking about from
[42:36] uh last
[42:42] Sunday. Praise the
[42:44] Lord. Amen.
[43:04] Revelation chapter
[43:13] 17. I want to take one verse tonight.
[43:20] And that will be verse 12.
[43:23] Uh that will be verse 12. Revelation
[43:26] chapter 17. Let's read verse 12. Or if
[43:29] we just want to do for reading. Let's go
[43:33] back and we started at verse 7 on Sunday
[43:36] and we read from verse 7. And the angel
[43:38] said unto me, "Wherefore uh thou Marvel,
[43:42] I will tell thee the mystery of the
[43:45] woman, and of the beast that carry her,
[43:49] which have the seven head and 10 horns,
[43:52] the beast that thou saw was in his net,
[43:57] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[43:59] pit, and go into pedition, and they that
[44:03] dwar shall wonder whose name were not
[44:06] written
[44:08] in the book of life from the foundation
[44:10] of the word when they behold the beast
[44:13] that was and is not and yet is. And here
[44:19] is the mind which have wisdom, the seven
[44:22] head are seven mountains on which the
[44:25] woman siteth, and there are seven kings.
[44:29] Five are fallen, and one is and the
[44:33] other is not yet come. And when he
[44:37] cometh, he must continue a short space.
[44:41] And the beast that was and is not even,
[44:46] he is the eight, and is of the seven,
[44:50] and goeth into pedition.
[44:53] And the 10 homes which they saw are 10
[44:57] kings, which have received no
[45:01] power receive no kingdom as yet, but
[45:06] receive power as kings. One hour with
[45:10] the beast. Praise the Lord. So tonight
[45:13] we just want to talk about one hour with
[45:14] the beast. The Lord bless you. You may
[45:17] have your
[45:18] seat. You may have your seat.
[45:21] feel a little bit throw off tonight, but
[45:23] we will trust that the Lord will be able
[45:27] to to just keep us together.
[45:31] Amen. We trust that the Lord will be
[45:34] able to keep us
[45:43] together. Praise the Lord.
[45:50] Praise the
[45:56] Lord. Amen.
[46:03] Now, so uh tonight uh
[46:06] uh we were we were speaking on from
[46:10] Sunday, not really trying to uh
[46:15] uh dive into prophecy, but uh where I
[46:20] wanted to continue on tonight is just to
[46:23] be able to speak a little bit of uh of
[46:28] uh influence.
[46:30] I just want to talk about influence.
[46:34] influence because when you look at uh
[46:38] uh the scripture that we just
[46:46] read, you will find out that
[46:49] uh
[46:51] um when when brother Brandham talks
[46:54] about this these 10 kings
[46:57] uh mark of the beast, let's just read
[46:59] one of the quote there in mark of the
[47:01] beast and uh and see what he
[47:15] said kind of for uh like I said true off
[47:19] a little bit. Listen listen to this. He
[47:21] said here, he said, "And the 10 horns
[47:24] which they saw are 10
[47:27] kings which have receive no kingdom as
[47:32] yet, but receive power as kings one hour
[47:36] with the beast. Or if we just had
[47:40] receive no power as yet, they are not
[47:44] kings."
[47:47] They didn't have they didn't have
[47:50] kingdom. Let's say that way. The
[47:54] horns didn't receive crowns. They
[47:58] receive power like kings. What is it?
[48:03] Detectors. Not crown kings. They are
[48:07] detectors.
[48:09] Now so uh uh the Bible says uh just one
[48:14] hour with the beast they have uh they
[48:19] have receive powers like kings now. So
[48:22] it's just where my mind was going with
[48:25] this is that if you remember was that
[48:28] last week when we had a prayer meeting
[48:30] we read the scripture Jesus speaking to
[48:32] his disciple and says why not pray with
[48:34] me one
[48:35] hour and uh uh he says pray with me that
[48:40] you will not fall into temptation.
[48:43] Okay. Now, so uh uh it is it is just in
[48:48] a place for us to be able to look at uh
[48:53] how much time it takes for us to be
[48:58] influenced. Praise the Lord. How much
[49:01] time it takes for us to be influenced?
[49:03] How much time do we need to have an
[49:06] influence that will change our life for
[49:09] the better or change our life for the
[49:12] worse? Praise the Lord. If you take it
[49:16] in the thought of Jesus talking to his
[49:18] disciples, he's telling them, you know,
[49:21] uh uh uh uh this is this is a serious
[49:24] hour for me. This is a dark hour for me.
[49:27] My spirit is feeling heavy, you know,
[49:30] and uh uh uh but I want you to to pray
[49:33] with me that you would not fall into
[49:36] temptation because of everything that
[49:38] were happening. I mean, all the demons
[49:41] in hell were all raging, you know, uh to
[49:44] be able to destroy this one that have
[49:48] cast them out. They have, you know, uh
[49:51] uh uh uh stop their power, stop their
[49:54] kingdom. And he's telling his disciple
[49:57] now watch out now you know I want you to
[50:00] uh to get on an influence here because
[50:03] uh uh there is uh you know a spiritual
[50:06] battle is almost like Elijah on the
[50:09] mountain you know uh and he's seeing the
[50:12] the the cherus of fires uh you know
[50:14] around the mountain and uh Elisha can
[50:17] see it and he's prayed and said Lord
[50:20] open the eyes of uh uh my servant so he
[50:24] will be able to see it. So that's what I
[50:26] want to go
[50:28] tonight. I want to go tonight when I
[50:31] when I did this
[50:33] uh
[50:38] back it is
[50:47] uh because when we look at when we look
[50:50] at uh uh influence
[50:54] We look at we know influence is a great
[50:57] thing. uh brother Brandon preached the
[51:00] message influence and he brought it to
[51:02] us uh just trying to help us to be able
[51:07] to see even though it's kind of aligning
[51:09] with with his ministry but he he's he
[51:12] brought it from Isaiah chapter 6 just
[51:15] for us to see how uh Isaiah was moved
[51:19] from under one influence to another
[51:22] influence being a prophet there he was a
[51:26] prophet he was in that office of a
[51:28] prophet prophet but he was honor uh an
[51:31] influence that he didn't know he was
[51:33] honor because the king yuzia was having
[51:36] influence on him but then uh god had to
[51:40] also change him from that influence and
[51:43] put him under the prophetic influence
[51:45] put him under the influence where you
[51:48] know uh his life purpose will be met his
[51:51] ministry will be a blessing so influence
[51:54] is a great thing praise the lord
[51:58] influence is a great thing. If you look
[52:01] at this in the line of this prophecy
[52:03] here that we are looking at just one
[52:06] hour with the beast, the Bible says
[52:09] uh uh
[52:12] uh if if you go back and read again uh
[52:15] uh verse 12, it says and and the and the
[52:18] 10 horns which they saw are 10 kings
[52:22] which have received no kingdom as yet.
[52:24] They don't have
[52:26] kingdom and uh yet they receive power as
[52:30] kings one hour with the beast. These
[52:33] have one mind and shall give their power
[52:38] and their strength to the beast. If you
[52:41] really want to put this in uh in in uh
[52:44] in context with history, what is going
[52:47] to happen at this time? They are going
[52:50] to be uh uh 10 detectors, 10 communist
[52:54] country. But Brandon, in uh uh uh why we
[52:58] are not denomination, there are some of
[53:00] the things that I did not put together
[53:02] very well tonight. So I'm not too happy
[53:04] with myself. But uh in in why we are not
[53:08] denomination, he says he says it like
[53:10] this. He says uh uh he says you will see
[53:15] that uh uh most communist country
[53:21] uh turn to have
[53:24] detectors. Okay. Most communist country
[53:27] h turn to have detectors. So if you want
[53:30] to look at this in uh in in the light
[53:33] with prophecy, what is going to happen
[53:36] here? You have to realize that uh uh uh
[53:41] uh Russia or these these uh these kings
[53:46] are going to come into an agreement with
[53:49] the Vatican and uh uh and then they are
[53:53] going to give the Vatican their power.
[53:55] Actually, they are going to be the power
[53:58] of the beast in the time of the
[54:00] persecution. But like I said, I'm not
[54:02] diving into prophecy tonight. I just
[54:05] want to dive into influence now. So if
[54:09] this man can receive power, now we know
[54:13] that this beast, you know, beast is a
[54:16] power like we we we talked about on on
[54:20] Sunday. This is a power coming right
[54:23] from the bottomless pit and leading
[54:25] people into pition, into loss, into
[54:28] destruction. Now, so uh if uh this man
[54:33] can receive power, you know, uh uh uh uh
[54:38] just one hour with the beast. Now think
[54:40] about it. Now Jesus told the church, I
[54:43] give you
[54:45] power.
[54:47] Amen. He said in the first commission,
[54:50] that's what he said to the disciple, I
[54:52] give you power over snakes and
[54:54] scorpions. Amen. So he said he, you
[54:58] know, he he gave us power. Now uh uh uh
[55:03] let's let's look at that a little
[55:09] bit. St. John chapter 10.
[55:26] How would you get it?
[56:42] Just give me a few minutes here. Let me
[56:44] know.
[57:01] Okay, sorry. Luke chapter 10. I see why
[57:04] I couldn't get it. Luke chapter
[57:08] 10 says in John chapter 10 but Luke
[57:11] chapter
[57:23] 10 Luke chapter 10 verse 17. Let's let's
[57:28] look at this
[57:32] together. And the 70 returned again with
[57:36] joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are
[57:42] subject unto us through thy
[57:45] name. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, this
[57:49] is under the first
[57:51] commission. This is under the the the
[57:54] beginning of the church. Let me say that
[57:58] when we know the church were fully
[58:00] birthed in the book of Acts, but this
[58:02] was the beginning. the sea form of the
[58:05] church and and and this man uh uh with
[58:10] Jesus they are going with him every word
[58:13] and you know they're beginning to see
[58:14] his ministry he's healing the sick and
[58:17] all of that and and and this is the
[58:19] first time that uh uh if you if you read
[58:23] the the fullness here Jesus sent this
[58:25] man out two by two and they are
[58:28] returning now and bringing uh you know
[58:31] report unto
[58:32] name. And when they returned, the Bible
[58:35] says the uh you know they said, "Lord,
[58:38] even the devils are subject unto us
[58:41] through thy
[58:42] name." And he said unto them, "I
[58:47] beheld Satan as a lightning fallen from
[58:52] heaven." Now see the power is given to
[58:56] the
[58:56] church. The Holy Ghost has not come yet.
[59:00] But these people have been
[59:03] influenced just with the time that they
[59:07] are spending with the Lord. And now they
[59:10] are beginning to break
[59:12] into supernatural power. Now they
[59:15] beginning to get uh flex their spiritual
[59:19] muscles to get uh you know uh h some
[59:23] position. They beginning to understand
[59:25] uh and and it is it's almost like the
[59:28] same thing they saw him doing is the
[59:30] same thing you know now they are
[59:32] experiencing you know demons are subject
[59:34] to
[59:36] us and Jesus is
[59:39] saying I
[59:42] beheld
[59:43] Satan as a lightning falling from
[59:46] heaven. Now you have to realize that it
[59:50] was not then that he fell because in
[59:53] Isaiah chapter 14 Isaiah had a vision
[59:58] when he saw Satan falling. Amen. Now the
[1:00:03] church is coming into power and the
[1:00:06] vision is continuing. Satan continuing
[1:00:09] to
[1:00:10] fall. Are we together?
[1:00:14] Are you seeing the picture?
[1:00:16] Praise the Lord. Until we come to
[1:00:19] position as sons and daughters of God,
[1:00:23] we will not see the falling of the
[1:00:25] enemy, we will always be to the place
[1:00:27] where we think that he's having dominion
[1:00:30] over our life.
[1:00:32] But when we come into position with the
[1:00:34] word, then we can see him falling no
[1:00:37] matter what we are going through.
[1:00:40] Are you are you grappling what I'm going
[1:00:41] tonight? Praise the Lord. But realize
[1:00:45] that the Holy Ghost has not come. The
[1:00:48] the the
[1:00:49] h day of Pentecost has not come. These
[1:00:52] people are only experiencing this just
[1:00:55] by the influence of being in his
[1:00:58] presence.
[1:01:01] How much more when they are in power?
[1:01:07] Are you seeing the picture? Amen.
[1:01:11] If under the beast system, just one hour
[1:01:15] with the
[1:01:18] beast, those kings or those leaders,
[1:01:22] those detectors are going to have so
[1:01:25] much
[1:01:26] power. So much
[1:01:28] power. If you even want to bring that
[1:01:31] into
[1:01:32] light, we know that every
[1:01:36] government is
[1:01:38] under the ruling of Satan
[1:01:41] and see how much
[1:01:44] power the presidents have in their
[1:01:48] nations. Amen.
[1:01:51] As soon as they take that
[1:01:54] office, all the power is behind
[1:01:58] it. Are we together?
[1:02:04] Are you Are you grabbing the picture
[1:02:05] where we going tonight?
[1:02:08] Amen. So if one hour with the beast will
[1:02:13] give them power, how much power will we
[1:02:17] have from our source of influence?
[1:02:22] That's where I'm going tonight. That's
[1:02:24] what I'm trying to bring to you tonight.
[1:02:26] So Jesus says, I I beheld. Not that I'm
[1:02:31] beholding. I beheld the falling that he
[1:02:34] kept falling from the beginning. I see
[1:02:36] him continuing to fall. Amen. I beheld
[1:02:41] Satan as a lightning fall from heaven.
[1:02:44] Behold, I gave unto you
[1:02:47] power to tread upon serpents and
[1:02:52] scorpions, and over all the power of the
[1:02:56] enemy, and nothing shall be and nothing
[1:03:00] shall by any means hurt you. Praise the
[1:03:04] Lord.
[1:03:09] Amen. Now, that is just before the Holy
[1:03:11] Ghost came. Amen.
[1:03:14] He's trying to let them
[1:03:17] know all of this time that you spending
[1:03:20] with me, I've been I've been releasing
[1:03:22] power to you.
[1:03:26] You are getting influence because you
[1:03:28] see what what I'm trying to get to uh uh
[1:03:32] uh church tonight on this Wednesday
[1:03:34] night is for us to be able to see the
[1:03:37] importance every time you spend time in
[1:03:41] his presence.
[1:03:43] Every time you spend time with the word,
[1:03:47] you are empowering yourself. You cannot
[1:03:51] overcome the enemy with good thought.
[1:03:54] Good intention cannot overcome the
[1:03:56] devil. Amen. Good desire cannot overcome
[1:04:00] the the devil. You can have good
[1:04:03] intentions. You can make up your mind,
[1:04:05] I'm going to stop this. I'm not going to
[1:04:08] do it anymore. It it does not fit him.
[1:04:10] That's right.
[1:04:14] Praise the Lord. He knows where your
[1:04:16] power comes from. He knows where your
[1:04:18] influence comes from. So the best thing
[1:04:21] he can do is keep you away from it. Keep
[1:04:24] you away from the word. Keep you away
[1:04:26] from praying
[1:04:28] because he knows that whenever you are
[1:04:31] with the word, you are in power.
[1:04:40] Are we together?
[1:04:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:49] Amen.
[1:04:51] Now, so he said, "Behold, I've I I I
[1:04:54] give unto you power, you know, to tread
[1:04:56] down serpents and scorpions and over all
[1:05:00] the power of the enemy." Praise the
[1:05:03] Lord.
[1:05:05] Amen. Over all the power of the
[1:05:12] enemy. And nothing shall by any means
[1:05:15] hurt you.
[1:05:16] Notwithstanding in this rejoice net that
[1:05:20] the spirits are subject unto you, but
[1:05:24] rather rejoice because your names are
[1:05:27] written in
[1:05:29] heaven. Praise the Lord. Amen. And we
[1:05:33] know heaven consists of the
[1:05:35] word. So your name is written in the
[1:05:38] book.
[1:05:41] Hallelujah. Then look at what is going
[1:05:43] to happen. The Bible says in their very
[1:05:47] hour Jesus rejoiced in the
[1:05:53] spirit. Praise the
[1:05:56] Lord. In that very hour, in that moment,
[1:06:00] what what what makes him to
[1:06:04] rejoice? The influence is catching on.
[1:06:10] Praise the Lord. They are not just
[1:06:12] following me.
[1:06:15] the influence is begin to catch on.
[1:06:21] Praise the Lord. You know uh in in in uh
[1:06:25] in in in biblical principle one of the
[1:06:29] best way to teach is by example.
[1:06:33] Sometimes it's not the lot that we say.
[1:06:36] It's not how how we say it. See what
[1:06:40] Jesus will
[1:06:41] do. He did not explain nothing to the
[1:06:44] disciples. He never told them
[1:06:47] anything. He come and and he told them
[1:06:49] we would meet for the supper. You know,
[1:06:51] they brought the the wine and bread and
[1:06:53] and uh uh it's a little bit different to
[1:06:56] the way that the the Jewish Passover was
[1:06:59] kept. It's a little bit different
[1:07:01] because it's whenever the Jewish
[1:07:03] Passover is kept, they remind himself of
[1:07:06] the Exod. They go back to the story of
[1:07:09] the Exodus when God brought us out of
[1:07:11] Egypt and the lamb was slay. That was
[1:07:14] what they were talking. But this night
[1:07:16] Jesus took the bread and said take this
[1:07:19] is my
[1:07:23] body. He took the cup. He's not talking
[1:07:27] about the blood on the lint of the
[1:07:28] doors. He said take this is my
[1:07:31] blood completely different. And they are
[1:07:34] all sitting down. He you know he he
[1:07:36] never preached a series to explain it to
[1:07:38] them and say you know uh uh uh communion
[1:07:41] this is what it means and this is he
[1:07:43] never did that. They all sitting there.
[1:07:46] They're watching what he's
[1:07:48] doing. The Bible says at the end of the
[1:07:51] feast he takes off his
[1:07:53] robe and he he took a
[1:07:57] towel. They all looking at him.
[1:08:01] He wrap it around him. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:06] Thank you for praying for me. Somebody
[1:08:08] just help me.
[1:08:11] I I just got things a little bit out of
[1:08:13] hand. So, I was I was just out of out of
[1:08:15] myself. So, uh uh uh he took the
[1:08:19] towel and then he got down and started
[1:08:22] washing their feet. Oh my god. They are
[1:08:26] all looking at him.
[1:08:29] Really? And he's taking their feet and
[1:08:32] he's washing their feet. Everybody
[1:08:34] thinking what is this? Oh my
[1:08:38] god. Yeah. And and and uh and the
[1:08:41] spokesman, everybody was keeping their
[1:08:43] thoughts in their mind. Peter said,
[1:08:45] "Nammy, when he come to me, I will tell
[1:08:47] him." Praise the Lord. Everybody
[1:08:51] say, you know, "Okay, I just give him my
[1:08:53] right foot." No. He says, "Bring the
[1:08:55] left one also." He wash both of them. He
[1:08:57] get to Peter. Peter said, "No, no, not
[1:09:00] me. No, Lord. you're not going to wash
[1:09:03] my
[1:09:04] feet. He never started a series.
[1:09:13] He could have he could have told uh uh
[1:09:15] uh Peter and say, you know, uh uh when
[1:09:18] when when when Ruth went to the feet of
[1:09:23] Boaz, where did she lay at his feet? You
[1:09:27] know, he could have gory and start
[1:09:29] breaking nothing. He says, "What I'm
[1:09:32] doing
[1:09:33] now, you will not know, but you will
[1:09:37] know year after."
[1:09:40] Are we together?
[1:09:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:44] So Peter said, "Okay, well, if you want
[1:09:47] to wash, then not only my feet, you got
[1:09:49] to bathe
[1:09:52] me. You got to wash my head, my
[1:09:56] ears, you know." Well, and he says, "He
[1:09:59] that is washed only his feet, that is
[1:10:02] enough. But then after it is done, then
[1:10:06] he said to
[1:10:08] them, you call me your Lord and your
[1:10:14] master." Praise the
[1:10:16] Lord. So you see, the teaching is coming
[1:10:19] after the
[1:10:21] action. The teaching is coming after the
[1:10:25] example.
[1:10:28] Are we together?
[1:10:31] Are you seeing where I'm going with
[1:10:33] this? Amen. The teaching is coming after
[1:10:37] the example. Now he said, "You call me
[1:10:39] Lord and Master and I being your Lord
[1:10:42] and Master, I have washed every one of
[1:10:45] you
[1:10:45] feet and this that I have done unto you,
[1:10:49] let it be an example."
[1:10:52] So Jesus powerful way of teaching was to
[1:10:57] make example not explaining.
[1:11:00] He was a man of few
[1:11:02] words. Are we together?
[1:11:08] Are we together? We can we can we can
[1:11:11] explain the god hell. We can you know we
[1:11:13] can we can explain the h uh the the we
[1:11:17] can explain everything that we know
[1:11:18] about the Bible.
[1:11:22] But it it does not have lot of effect
[1:11:26] than the examples from our lives.
[1:11:30] Praise the Lord. Amen. People are
[1:11:35] imparted by the way we influence them
[1:11:39] more than the way we lecture them.
[1:11:45] Amen. The way we influence them. You
[1:11:49] know, brother Ram would talk about uh uh
[1:11:52] uh uh Amra uh uh feeling the burden and
[1:11:55] the need uh and what was happening in
[1:11:58] Egypt at the time. He says, "And Amra
[1:12:01] will come from work." He's so tired he
[1:12:03] will just slip. He's not he's not
[1:12:05] yelling at Aaron and uh Miriam and and
[1:12:08] Jacob and says, "I mean uh we must be
[1:12:11] having a prayer meeting in this house,
[1:12:13] you know, and he's no
[1:12:14] no he's having the burden." Praise the
[1:12:18] Lord. He's the one feeling this thing.
[1:12:21] And then he goes into the presence of
[1:12:23] the Lord and he's crying and brother
[1:12:25] says, "And I'm Jacob says, man, this man
[1:12:28] is tired. I mean, uh, will he rest? Are
[1:12:31] you just the only one that uh that is
[1:12:33] concerned about our
[1:12:35] people?" But pretty soon that
[1:12:41] influence will start robbing.
[1:12:45] Praise the Lord. The same way bad
[1:12:48] influence can spread, good influence can
[1:12:51] also spread.
[1:12:54] Praise the Lord. Now most of the time
[1:12:58] the the the hindrances comes because we
[1:13:01] make ourself the picture. We make
[1:13:04] ourself the
[1:13:05] image. And the moment you do that, you
[1:13:09] don't have personal the influence. My my
[1:13:12] personal influence will be as a a sinful
[1:13:16] influence. Amen. Because I'm born in
[1:13:19] sin, shiplet, iniquity. Either I try to
[1:13:21] make you just like me, learn to talk
[1:13:24] like me, you got to be slow just like
[1:13:26] me. You know, uh that that just all I
[1:13:28] can give
[1:13:29] you. Amen.
[1:13:37] Are you getting the picture?
[1:13:43] So you think about it
[1:13:45] now. Think about
[1:13:49] it. The Lord Jesus knowing knowing what
[1:13:53] the disciples were
[1:13:55] going to be dealing with. And no doubt
[1:13:59] no doubt I believe that uh uh uh every
[1:14:03] hell
[1:14:04] presence was was was just was just so
[1:14:07] much heavy over those guys. I believe
[1:14:09] they try to make effort to pray but uh I
[1:14:13] mean they they just they just fall
[1:14:16] asleep on their knees and this other one
[1:14:18] say well let me just lay there I can
[1:14:19] pray on my stomach before he realized
[1:14:21] he's snoring the other one says okay I
[1:14:23] think I can sit down and pray I'm
[1:14:24] feeling tired before he realized he's
[1:14:26] not I believe every one of them tried to
[1:14:28] make some
[1:14:30] effort praise the
[1:14:32] Lord but take it on the other
[1:14:38] high. What if they will have they will
[1:14:41] have really come under that uh uh uh
[1:14:44] that that influence of
[1:14:47] praying when the Bible says he prayed in
[1:14:52] anguish and he was pouring his
[1:14:56] heart. Praise the Lord. Amen. When the
[1:15:01] Bible says his his his sweat was thick
[1:15:04] as blood, I was just looking at that
[1:15:07] couple of weeks back. Uh uh uh uh there
[1:15:10] is a medical term term for it. Because
[1:15:12] of the way he was so much in anguish,
[1:15:16] his sweat was mixed with blood. That's
[1:15:19] what it
[1:15:23] was because of just how he was in
[1:15:26] anguish. So you think about it, if every
[1:15:28] one of them will have fall under that
[1:15:32] influence, if every one of them will
[1:15:34] have just been so burdening like the way
[1:15:37] he was burdening, I don't think they
[1:15:39] will have wait for 10 days. I believe
[1:15:40] Pentecost will have be that night.
[1:15:49] Are we together? Praise the Lord.
[1:15:54] Moses needed five minutes.
[1:15:58] He just needed five
[1:16:01] meanings under the influence of the
[1:16:04] burning bush, it changed his life. Five
[1:16:08] meanings. So you will realize when you
[1:16:10] look at scriptural order, it's more hard
[1:16:14] to be influenced by the wrong than to be
[1:16:17] influenced by God.
[1:16:20] If you come with a open heart and honor
[1:16:23] expectation, you can get positive
[1:16:25] influence.
[1:16:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:34] Five minutes in the presence of God, it
[1:16:37] changes
[1:16:42] life. Praise the
[1:16:44] Lord. Think about this also. Uh uh uh uh
[1:16:48] uh uh uh most of the dreams that we
[1:16:53] have you it can looks like you are
[1:16:56] dreaming all through the night but
[1:16:58] dreams are mostly in two or three
[1:17:02] seconds. Praise the Lord. The reason why
[1:17:05] it looks like it's long is because the
[1:17:08] speed of your subconscious is more
[1:17:11] faster than your first conscious. in
[1:17:13] your subconscious you you you do things
[1:17:16] more faster. You remember fast.
[1:17:18] Something happened. You you can you can
[1:17:21] travel back to 10 years
[1:17:23] ago. You can see an act and your your
[1:17:26] whole mind goes back to 10 years
[1:17:28] ago. But for you to travel back to 10
[1:17:31] years ago in your first conscious is
[1:17:33] going to be
[1:17:35] difficult. Are we together?
[1:17:42] So it's it's it's it's uh it's it's it's
[1:17:46] in that sense when you have u you have a
[1:17:49] you know you have a you have a good
[1:17:51] dream and you have a you know uh uh uh
[1:17:54] you you just see when you wake up the
[1:17:57] feeling on on both side whether it's a
[1:17:58] good dream or a bad dream. Let's let's
[1:18:00] take a good dream. Let's forget about
[1:18:01] the bad one. Amen. Because we don't want
[1:18:04] bad dreams. Amen. Nobody go to bed and
[1:18:07] says I want bad dreams tonight.
[1:18:10] Praise the Lord. We always pray that the
[1:18:12] Lord will give us good dreams. Amen. He
[1:18:16] will give us good visions of the
[1:18:18] night. Praise the Lord. And uh uh and
[1:18:22] and and and then you wake up, you you I
[1:18:24] I mean if if uh if if you were dreaming,
[1:18:27] you were in a meeting, you know, and and
[1:18:30] uh uh uh and and the meeting was
[1:18:32] wonderful, you see the kind of a feeling
[1:18:34] that it gives you.
[1:18:37] Amen.
[1:18:39] not so much of a dream dream person. So,
[1:18:42] uh uh uh you know, blessing to all of
[1:18:45] you that have
[1:18:50] dreams. Are we
[1:18:55] together? There were few things that I
[1:18:57] really wanted to share with you tonight,
[1:18:59] but I'm I'm sure that the Lord will will
[1:19:02] be able to to to help us for us to to
[1:19:06] get back to it. So we just stay in this
[1:19:08] place of influence. So you think about
[1:19:10] it
[1:19:11] now. Think about it. Just before the
[1:19:14] Holy Ghost here, he said this
[1:19:17] man the the uh uh praying for the sake
[1:19:21] influence is rubbing on
[1:19:24] them. Pray. Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh to
[1:19:29] the to the to the to the Jewish custom,
[1:19:32] you think about the man born blind. You
[1:19:34] think about the way that uh uh uh it's
[1:19:39] because from the law they learned that
[1:19:42] uh sickness is because of
[1:19:45] sin. So you think about how when a man
[1:19:49] had leprosy, he was kept out of the
[1:19:52] city. When a man was blind, he was just
[1:19:56] he was just a useless person in the
[1:19:59] society.
[1:20:01] When a person was lame, they see that as
[1:20:04] the result of
[1:20:06] sin.
[1:20:08] Amen. So these men never had they they
[1:20:13] never grew up experiencing going to lay
[1:20:16] their hands on somebody that is
[1:20:19] sick. They see a person sick and says,
[1:20:21] "I I don't know what his parents did."
[1:20:27] And may maybe his grandfather was a
[1:20:29] thief. That's the curse that have come
[1:20:30] on him. That that is that is the way
[1:20:32] that they treated somebody that was
[1:20:34] sick.
[1:20:37] Amen. You could see even the disciples
[1:20:40] struggling under that thought. Lord,
[1:20:42] that man born blind, was it his father?
[1:20:44] Was it his mother? Yeah. Because they
[1:20:47] were still under that Jewish way of of
[1:20:51] thinking. But it says now because they
[1:20:54] have stayed. You think about think about
[1:20:57] uh uh uh uh uh uh David
[1:21:01] warriors. When you read about David men,
[1:21:04] the men that was around David, you read
[1:21:06] about them, the Bible tells you that uh
[1:21:09] uh all of those men because they kept
[1:21:13] hearing about killing a lion. Everybody
[1:21:16] wanted to kill a lion.
[1:21:22] one had to jump in a hole with a lion
[1:21:24] and and he end up killing the lion. Why?
[1:21:27] Because David testimony influenced them
[1:21:32] that if God can do it in the life of
[1:21:34] this man, God can also do it in my life.
[1:21:40] Amen.
[1:21:42] The result of positive confession,
[1:21:46] it create positive
[1:21:49] influence. Right?
[1:21:52] Are we together? But what what I'm
[1:21:55] really trying to grab your mind to is
[1:21:57] that
[1:21:59] how quick we can be influenced.
[1:22:05] How quick we can be influenced. How
[1:22:07] quick things that we see with our eyes
[1:22:12] can influence our thoughts.
[1:22:16] How quick things we hear with our ears
[1:22:19] can
[1:22:20] influence
[1:22:25] us. Are we
[1:22:28] together? Praise the Lord. You have to
[1:22:31] remember now is the atmosphere that
[1:22:35] brings the result.
[1:22:38] Amen. Is the atmosphere that brings the
[1:22:41] result. The hand create a warm
[1:22:45] atmosphere. That's what help for the
[1:22:50] cheeks to hatch the eggs. If you take
[1:22:53] the the the the the egg from under the
[1:22:56] hand, put it under the duck. If the dog
[1:22:58] create that same atmosphere, the cheeks
[1:23:01] will be hatch. If you take it from under
[1:23:03] the dog, put it under a
[1:23:07] dog. If it create the same atmosphere,
[1:23:10] the eggs will be hash.
[1:23:13] You like don't get no animal just get
[1:23:16] enough light that can create the same
[1:23:20] temperature of of uh of atmosphere the
[1:23:23] air will be harsh. So it is the
[1:23:26] atmosphere that brings the result.
[1:23:30] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:23:34] We cannot bring God's word to pass. All
[1:23:38] he want us to do is create the
[1:23:40] atmosphere. He's the law that inhabit
[1:23:43] the praises of his people. So the only
[1:23:46] thing he needs you to do is to praise
[1:23:48] him.
[1:23:55] Are we together?
[1:23:57] Is the atmosphere that brings the
[1:24:02] result. Amen.
[1:24:04] Let's not look for a fire. Let's ask
[1:24:08] ourself what atmosphere
[1:24:10] are we creating?
[1:24:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:16] What atmosphere are we
[1:24:21] creating? Praise the
[1:24:24] Lord. Isaiah went under this influence
[1:24:29] of Yuzia for a long time. He was he was
[1:24:32] downcast. He was he was out of place.
[1:24:35] But he went one day when he went into
[1:24:39] the house of the
[1:24:41] Lord. Praise the
[1:24:44] Lord. And he was able to just pour his
[1:24:47] heart before
[1:24:48] God. Woe is me. It's is a shame on me.
[1:24:52] Lord, I should be better than
[1:24:56] this. Amen. What is this mean? It's a
[1:25:00] shame I got my m my mouth into politics
[1:25:03] just talking King M. I should be better
[1:25:06] than this.
[1:25:08] A man of unclean lips among people with
[1:25:11] unclean
[1:25:14] lips. Praise the
[1:25:17] Lord. And when he poured himself out
[1:25:20] before
[1:25:21] God, he said the post of the temple
[1:25:26] move.
[1:25:29] Praise the
[1:25:32] Lord. In that short period of
[1:25:35] time, the atmosphere around him
[1:25:42] changed. The thing
[1:25:44] that have happened all through the the
[1:25:48] ages is that we try to teach
[1:25:53] Christianity. We try to practice
[1:25:56] Christianity.
[1:26:01] We can teach it. We can we can practice
[1:26:04] it. It's not to be
[1:26:08] practiced. Praise the
[1:26:11] Lord. We have to believe it. We have to
[1:26:15] believe that there's there's a there's a
[1:26:18] there's a God of the universe. We have
[1:26:21] to believe that uh uh uh uh uh uh he
[1:26:24] took on flesh. He paid the price for our
[1:26:28] sinful nature to be destroyed. We have
[1:26:31] to believe it. Amen.
[1:26:34] You have to you have to look at your
[1:26:36] struggle and say this thing was paid
[1:26:38] for. You know the the blood was shared
[1:26:41] for it. It can be done with. I believe
[1:26:44] it. Not how much you practice to be
[1:26:46] nice.
[1:26:48] No, you have to believe what the word
[1:26:51] says. You have to receive it. As you
[1:26:55] continue to confess the word like John
[1:26:58] Ryan, it brings you into an atmosphere
[1:27:01] and that atmosphere brings the result.
[1:27:04] Your body will obey your confession.
[1:27:08] That is the result of the atmosphere
[1:27:11] that you create by your confession.
[1:27:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:19] Amen.
[1:27:22] That's what we try to we try to do you
[1:27:24] know as message beloved we try to teach
[1:27:26] how we must dress we try to teach how we
[1:27:29] must walk we try to how we must talk we
[1:27:31] try to how we must sit and how we must
[1:27:33] sleep and how we must get up and we get
[1:27:37] all of these things line
[1:27:39] up. Praise the
[1:27:45] Lord. It is just enough to give us the
[1:27:49] form of godliness.
[1:27:54] All of that is enough to give us the
[1:27:57] form of
[1:27:58] godliness. But the power,
[1:28:02] the power, the spike.
[1:28:09] Are we together? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:13] Praise. You see it? I' I've just trying
[1:28:16] to bring this in a way that
[1:28:20] uh because what what I'm laboring under
[1:28:24] actually is uh
[1:28:27] uh if if we can
[1:28:31] have we don't need one hour. They might
[1:28:34] need one hour with the beast because
[1:28:36] they get a lot of political things to
[1:28:38] learn.
[1:28:40] We might need five minutes in the
[1:28:42] presence of the Lord. If we can come
[1:28:44] with grateful heart, if even our young
[1:28:48] people, the the the even the children
[1:28:51] can learn to go to their room and just
[1:28:53] and just and just say their childlike
[1:28:56] prayer to the Lord.
[1:28:59] Praise the Lord. And just and just start
[1:29:02] start learning to be conscious of his
[1:29:04] presence.
[1:29:07] Are we together?
[1:29:10] Amen. I was listening to a message
[1:29:12] today. Super sign. Brother Abraham says
[1:29:14] something that was that was mahala. That
[1:29:17] was where I wanted to start from this
[1:29:19] evening. And uh
[1:29:21] uh so I was trying to trying to find a
[1:29:24] quick he was there in Chicago then he
[1:29:26] was talking he's talking about brother
[1:29:28] Joseph Boz. He says he always saying you
[1:29:31] know uh Chicago needs a shaking. He says
[1:29:36] Chicago has already been
[1:29:40] shocked. He says many times when people
[1:29:43] talk about we need a shaking, they are
[1:29:46] looking for something national to
[1:29:51] happen. But you take take it like this.
[1:29:53] This is the way I I' I've was meditating
[1:29:55] on it this morning. Take it like this.
[1:29:57] Uh when when Elijah told the the the
[1:30:01] widow woman the bag would not go dry,
[1:30:04] the oil would not finish until the
[1:30:06] drought is
[1:30:08] open. All she have to do every time she
[1:30:11] comes is to just shake the
[1:30:13] bag. Now when there is a shaking that
[1:30:16] takes place when you I mean if you have
[1:30:18] ever been to that place shake a rice bag
[1:30:20] or shake a flower bag the ramen goes
[1:30:24] down. Praise the Lord. You might have a
[1:30:27] bunch of dust, flower dust that might
[1:30:30] just spray all over the place, but the
[1:30:32] real thing you need gather together.
[1:30:36] Praise the Lord. So he was trying to say
[1:30:39] it. He said, Joseph is always talking
[1:30:41] about Chicago. He says Chicago has
[1:30:43] already been shooking. He said that's
[1:30:45] why we are here. He said when God shakes
[1:30:48] the place, what happened is that he get
[1:30:51] the church in line.
[1:30:54] Praise the Lord. When you shake the bag,
[1:30:56] you you you try to gather the wheat
[1:30:59] together so you can be able to take what
[1:31:02] you need.
[1:31:07] So when God shake us, I was just
[1:31:10] thinking about it this morning. I says,
[1:31:12] "Wow." I mean, uh uh uh uh Lord, I I
[1:31:16] mean uh uh uh if if if just the the
[1:31:20] assemblies around uh Minneapolis can
[1:31:23] just get in line with the word, that's
[1:31:25] the
[1:31:26] shaking. What is what is the need of us
[1:31:29] having great crusades and making big
[1:31:32] publications and we're not lining up
[1:31:34] with the word? We forcing in our homes
[1:31:37] and fighting
[1:31:45] That's where I was going to start from
[1:31:46] this evening, but anyway, somebody
[1:31:48] brought it out of me. God bless you
[1:31:51] wherever you are.
[1:31:58] Amen. You look at you look at the Senate
[1:32:01] of Minneapolis. You look at the state of
[1:32:03] Minnesota and you think about, oh my
[1:32:05] god, this kind of a big state. And uh
[1:32:08] you look at oh my god I mean uh just see
[1:32:11] the kind of a h few sprinkling uh uh h
[1:32:16] assembly that we have. But if God can be
[1:32:19] able to have a church of just 10 people.
[1:32:23] Amen. Just 10 that are lining up with
[1:32:28] the word. They have their devotion,
[1:32:31] their prayer life, their consecration.
[1:32:34] They come to church and they mean
[1:32:35] business. That that is a shaking. God
[1:32:39] has shook the city that he was able to
[1:32:42] get a few people in his hands.
[1:32:45] Not not a big
[1:32:47] h public that we want to
[1:32:55] make. Are we together? Amen.
[1:33:00] And then and that's that's what I'm
[1:33:02] laboring on. That's where my thoughts
[1:33:05] are. That's where my heart
[1:33:07] is. Praise the
[1:33:10] Lord. That is not just enough for the
[1:33:13] Wednesday night. You think about it.
[1:33:15] Think about it. I mean, when we have
[1:33:18] this time, everybody try to work out
[1:33:20] their schedule, you know, uh to make
[1:33:23] sure they can be able to be in church on
[1:33:25] Wednesday night because I mean, we we
[1:33:28] are spread about in the city, you know,
[1:33:30] even when we have special meetings. I I
[1:33:33] I want to say thank you. you know, this
[1:33:35] this uh this gone Saturday night and and
[1:33:37] Sunday morning with uh brother uh Crosby
[1:33:41] was wonderful. You know, it was
[1:33:43] wonderful uh uh to have people come out
[1:33:46] Saturday night and support a meeting.
[1:33:48] That's what we supposed to
[1:33:50] do. Okay, if we were all living in the
[1:33:53] same community just around the church,
[1:33:55] it's easy to have three service a week.
[1:33:57] It's easy to even have
[1:34:00] five because we can just walk from. But
[1:34:02] when we are spread about around the city
[1:34:06] and people have to drive 30 minutes, 45
[1:34:08] minutes, an hour, 2 hours to
[1:34:12] church, then the time that we have to
[1:34:16] come together to spend
[1:34:18] together, it must not just be a time of
[1:34:20] laughter. It must not be a time where we
[1:34:23] just come to, you know, say something
[1:34:25] just to burn up the evening. It must be
[1:34:28] a time where we come and we want to rob
[1:34:31] against his presence. We want an
[1:34:34] influence from the service. We want an
[1:34:36] influence from the presence of God
[1:34:38] because we know we will not be back yet
[1:34:40] again until Sunday.
[1:34:45] It must not just be for an entertainment
[1:34:48] or a fulfillment of Wednesday night
[1:34:50] service.
[1:34:55] No. Praise the
[1:35:00] Lord. One
[1:35:02] hour. Jesus told his disciple one
[1:35:07] hour. Praise the
[1:35:09] Lord.
[1:35:11] Amen. But when the Holy Ghost came, it
[1:35:14] was
[1:35:17] different. It was different. I believe
[1:35:19] when when they were gathered in the
[1:35:21] upper room and a few of them can can
[1:35:24] remember when he says just pray with me
[1:35:27] one hour and they were feeling all of
[1:35:31] that pressure on them outside the Roman
[1:35:34] soldier the sahedrin's council is
[1:35:36] looking for
[1:35:38] them they are feeling all of the
[1:35:40] pressure on them now they can now
[1:35:42] appreciate when he said pray with me in
[1:35:45] one hour that you will not fall into
[1:35:49] temptation. They can now appreciate it.
[1:35:52] Says, "Peter, what? What?" He says, he
[1:35:55] says, "Let's let's wait. The promise of
[1:35:57] the Holy Ghost. We can't get out there,
[1:36:00] people. And I I don't want to I don't
[1:36:02] want to deny him again.
[1:36:06] I know the horrible feeling I felt when
[1:36:08] I denied. I don't want to deny him."
[1:36:13] He promised us that we will be endued
[1:36:15] with power.
[1:36:17] When the Holy Ghost came. Amen. Praise
[1:36:19] the Lord. That's the reason why when the
[1:36:22] Holy Ghost came, he was not afraid.
[1:36:25] He got right out there. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:29] He got right out there. He was not
[1:36:30] afraid. The the the power that had
[1:36:33] rubbed against him, now that power was
[1:36:35] dwelling in him. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:44] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:36:49] Yeah. When we come to church, that's
[1:36:51] what we come to. We come to we out
[1:36:53] there, we rub arms with the with the
[1:36:55] word. That's what brother Brandon said.
[1:36:57] When we come here, we want we want to
[1:36:59] rub shoulder, arms, feet, everything
[1:37:01] with the Lord.
[1:37:06] Praise the
[1:37:07] Lord. That's how we have to watch one
[1:37:09] another. Don't let somebody rub sleep
[1:37:11] against you in the house of God because
[1:37:13] spirit congregates. When a person starts
[1:37:16] sleeping and praying soon before you
[1:37:17] realize too you you start getting
[1:37:19] dosing.
[1:37:22] Amen. Just be nice about it and give the
[1:37:25] person uh you know a little tap on their
[1:37:29] shoulder. What am I saying? Let's make
[1:37:32] the most use of the time we come here.
[1:37:35] Praise the Lord. You think about it.
[1:37:37] It's
[1:37:39] 9:03 and as soon as service some will
[1:37:42] have to drive an hour to get
[1:37:46] home. And if we just come here just to
[1:37:49] fulfill a Wednesday night
[1:37:53] religion, do you see how how how of all
[1:37:57] men we are most miserable?
[1:38:07] That's what I'm saying
[1:38:11] tonight. When we come here, we come in.
[1:38:15] The Bible says to edify one another.
[1:38:19] Amen. The Bible says to encourage one
[1:38:22] another unto good work. Provoke one
[1:38:24] another unto good work. But in it
[1:38:27] all, we are coming to get under his
[1:38:31] influence.
[1:38:32] We are coming to get under the influence
[1:38:35] this seeing the influence of the seven
[1:38:38] angel.
[1:38:42] To get under the influence of the seven
[1:38:45] angel. Praise the
[1:38:56] Lord. So when we have to pray, let's
[1:38:58] pray.
[1:39:02] That's why Jesus told him, "Pray that
[1:39:03] you will not fall into
[1:39:12] temptation." Are we
[1:39:14] together? I hope I said something that
[1:39:16] encourage you tonight. I've uh uh kind
[1:39:19] of just spread all my things all over
[1:39:23] the place, but uh uh that's that's
[1:39:26] that's exactly what I'm laboring on.
[1:39:30] Amen. We find uh a beast power that is
[1:39:36] rising. We see uh uh an ungodly
[1:39:41] influence that is all around
[1:39:43] us. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:49] That's the reason why not only our time
[1:39:52] in church but your time on your knees
[1:39:56] and the time that you spend with the
[1:39:59] word. Don't take it just for a religious
[1:40:03] ritual that you are
[1:40:05] fulfilling. The Bible says you know what
[1:40:08] the prophet say I must read my Bible and
[1:40:10] pray every day. It must not just be a
[1:40:12] slogan.
[1:40:15] You must be able to realize but Ram says
[1:40:18] when you take this Bible you are looking
[1:40:20] right in his
[1:40:22] face. You are looking right in his face.
[1:40:27] James said it in another way. You are
[1:40:29] looking in a mirror.
[1:40:33] Praise the Lord. You are looking in the
[1:40:35] mirror of God's word. But you see the
[1:40:38] thing that is that what you're supposed
[1:40:40] to be seeing in the mirror is the image
[1:40:43] of Christ.
[1:40:45] Amen. Not not I mean not if you are
[1:40:47] losing your head or I mean or your head
[1:40:49] is growing or I mean you are putting on
[1:40:52] weight or you are losing weight. That's
[1:40:53] not why we look in the word for we look
[1:40:56] to see his image. How much am I
[1:40:59] conforming to his
[1:41:05] image? How much is this word changing
[1:41:09] me? How much am I falling in love with
[1:41:12] this word? Praise the Lord. I'll say
[1:41:15] this and then I close tonight. Thank you
[1:41:18] for bearing with me. And uh I was
[1:41:20] talking to to Joy last week and we were
[1:41:23] we were just visiting on the phone and
[1:41:25] and I was I was sharing something with
[1:41:27] her and I thought, okay, today is the
[1:41:29] last is the last uh uh uh day in uh in
[1:41:34] April. Tomorrow May 1 begin. So I I I
[1:41:38] was sharing this with her and I thought
[1:41:40] about it because uh I've been I've been
[1:41:43] reading through the book of proverb. You
[1:41:45] know proverb has 31 chapter and it's
[1:41:49] good for a 31 day in a month. I've tried
[1:41:52] this before. I learned it from uh uh uh
[1:41:57] an old preacher and I tried it before
[1:41:59] and it's is is it's very beautiful. It's
[1:42:02] a it's a good exercise. If you take one
[1:42:05] chapter in the day of proverb, you have
[1:42:09] to realize now proverb begins with uh uh
[1:42:13] the beginning of the Lord. You know the
[1:42:15] the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:42:17] evil of wisdom sorry is the is the
[1:42:21] beginning of wisdom. Now, so right there
[1:42:24] in proverb, you will see where uh and
[1:42:26] and there were just some beautiful
[1:42:27] things that was sprinking out of out of
[1:42:29] the book for me. And uh I I kind of a
[1:42:32] plan to to speak
[1:42:34] something on
[1:42:36] uh on Mother's Day coming up if if I had
[1:42:40] the opportunity to preach and uh and and
[1:42:43] and most of it will come from the book
[1:42:45] of Proverb. You realize that Solomon
[1:42:48] will speak of wisdom in a complete
[1:42:52] different way than you will ever think
[1:42:54] about
[1:42:55] it. He takes wisdom in a feminine
[1:43:00] gender. Yeah.
[1:43:04] Okay. whenever he talks about wisdom and
[1:43:06] understanding how wisdom build her house
[1:43:13] and uh uh uh but it's it's it's a very
[1:43:18] beautiful thing that that I've like I
[1:43:20] said I've tried before you read you read
[1:43:23] a chapter you just meditate upon
[1:43:26] it and as you go about your
[1:43:31] day you will realize something will
[1:43:35] happen in the day. Yeah. That you will
[1:43:38] relate right
[1:43:40] because you see it it it challenge your
[1:43:42] mind because uh uh you want to be wise.
[1:43:46] You want the wisdom of God. You want
[1:43:50] understanding. So as as you as you read
[1:43:53] it and meditate upon it, you realize
[1:43:56] that and it it's just a beautiful
[1:43:58] feeling. I've I've I've seen it and it's
[1:44:01] just it's just so beautiful.
[1:44:06] You can you can try it if you want to.
[1:44:08] If you if you miss if you miss a
[1:44:10] chapter, don't don't bother don't bother
[1:44:12] to go back and and and if you didn't
[1:44:14] read on May 2nd, just take May and just
[1:44:18] just go ahead like that and you will see
[1:44:20] how how rewarding it can be. Let's let's
[1:44:22] just musicians, you can come
[1:44:24] tonight before I get into a talking
[1:44:29] spell. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:32] But uh that was what on my mind. That
[1:44:35] was what I wanted to to especially when
[1:44:38] I was listening to Broadband talking
[1:44:40] about, you know, uh uh uh
[1:44:45] uh Chicago being shook by the gospel. He
[1:44:50] said great men like Moody, like uh uh uh
[1:44:53] you know uh and and all of the great men
[1:44:56] that have come through Chicago. He says
[1:44:58] he says this city is is all. So he said,
[1:45:00] "What kind of a shaking are we waiting
[1:45:02] for?" You
[1:45:04] know, and uh and that's that's the same
[1:45:08] I want to encourage
[1:45:10] you. Praise the Lord. We want we want
[1:45:13] the word to line us up. We want us we
[1:45:18] want to see that. We want to see the
[1:45:21] effect of the word in our home, in a
[1:45:23] relationship with our wives, with our
[1:45:25] husband, with our children, the
[1:45:28] relationship with one another.
[1:45:33] No, the church over over the years has
[1:45:37] taught us very wrong. You hear people
[1:45:40] says salvation is an individual affair.
[1:45:43] It's a kind of a very selfish very
[1:45:46] selfish which mean it's just me and my
[1:45:49] god.
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:54] No, God. The reason why he manifested
[1:45:59] himself was to come and dwell with his
[1:46:03] family, was to come and dwell with his
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:12] children. So he puts people in our life.
[1:46:16] He allow us trials in our life.
[1:46:20] Most of the time we look at the negative
[1:46:23] part but he want us to also be able to
[1:46:26] see how much we are growing in grace.
[1:46:29] How are we dealing with the things that
[1:46:31] we are dealing
[1:46:33] with. Think about how you will have
[1:46:35] dealt with it yesterday and how the
[1:46:38] grace of God is helping you to deal with
[1:46:40] it today.
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:46] He want you to be able to see your
[1:46:49] growth. He want you to see how much you
[1:46:52] are falling in love with
[1:46:54] him. How much the word of God is
[1:46:57] rejoicing your heart. You are not only
[1:47:00] rejoicing because uh uh uh uh uh people
[1:47:03] have been healed. You are rejoicing
[1:47:05] because you hear the word speaking to
[1:47:08] you personally. You hear your name being
[1:47:10] called from the book. It always blessed
[1:47:13] my heart when one of the young people,
[1:47:15] one of the little ones come to me in the
[1:47:17] office and start to talk about what was
[1:47:20] preached. It always blessed my heart.
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:33] One of them was talking to me about uh
[1:47:36] uh uh uh uh what what is say about that
[1:47:38] that uh uh oil and anointing oil? Why
[1:47:42] are you putting oil on people
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:47] head? So we open the Bible right there
[1:47:50] and and then we started to read. It's a
[1:47:53] beautiful thing. It's a beautiful thing.
[1:47:56] You don't know how much I enjoy that
[1:47:59] than when you asking me about the
[1:48:00] millennium.
[1:48:04] When the little children ask me those
[1:48:06] kind of a question, I enjoy it more than
[1:48:09] when you asking me about the
[1:48:13] rapture. This is your
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:18] house. This is your house.
[1:48:24] Come and
[1:48:27] dwell, oh Lord, this is your
[1:48:33] house.
[1:48:35] Father, come and
[1:48:37] [Music]
[1:48:39] dwell. This is your
[1:48:45] house, Lord. A holy house of
[1:48:50] prayer where the lost and the
[1:48:55] lonely bring their burdens and their
[1:49:00] cares. This is your
[1:49:05] house. This is your
[1:49:10] house. Come and dwell. We are your
[1:49:15] household. We are your
[1:49:21] house.
[1:49:22] Father, please come and

[1:49:32] house. A holy house of
[1:49:36] prayer. where the lost and the
[1:49:41] lonely bring your
[1:49:44] burdens and your cares. We are your
[1:49:51] house. We are your
[1:49:56] house. Come and
[1:49:58] dwell. I am your house, Lord. I am your
[1:50:03] house.
[1:50:07] Father come and
[1:50:11] dwell. I am your
[1:50:18] house. A holy house of
[1:50:22] prayer. Where the lost and the
[1:50:27] lonely. Where we bring our burdens and
[1:50:30] our
[1:50:32] cares. We are your house.
[1:50:37] This is your
[1:50:41] house. Come and dwell. Let's just take
[1:50:45] this little moment and just thank the
[1:50:47] Lord for giving us this opportunity to
[1:50:50] be together tonight. And and just we
[1:50:52] just want to ask him that uh every time
[1:50:57] spent together, every time spent in his
[1:50:59] presence will will just be so much of a
[1:51:02] blessing. And uh uh we want the the
[1:51:06] influence of the word to rock against
[1:51:08] us. We want uh to be under his
[1:51:11] influence. Heavenly Father, in the name
[1:51:14] of the Lord Jesus, we just want to thank
[1:51:16] you tonight. Oh God, we want to thank
[1:51:18] you, Father. We want to thank you,
[1:51:20] Almighty God. Oh God, what a wonderful
[1:51:23] father you are, Lord. What? Oh God, a
[1:51:26] great God you are in the name of Jesus
[1:51:29] Christ. Oh father god we pray oh lord.
[1:51:33] Oh father father your prophecy said we
[1:51:36] are either influencing somebody or
[1:51:38] somebody is influencing us. Oh precious
[1:51:42] lord we just cannot be father Lord God
[1:51:45] without an influence. Influence is very
[1:51:48] important in our life. Oh God. Father we
[1:51:51] pray Lord Jesus. Almighty God we pray oh
[1:51:55] Father and rejoice you in that hour Lord
[1:51:58] and rejoice you oh Father God to see
[1:52:01] Lord the influence of your word breaking
[1:52:04] upon the disciples Lord. It rejoice you
[1:52:08] father. You said you are revealing the
[1:52:10] tobis his hand from the eyes of the wise
[1:52:13] and the prudent. But this little group
[1:52:16] is beginning to grapple. Lord, Father,
[1:52:18] let it be the same with us. Lord, may we
[1:52:21] grab the importance of prayer. May we
[1:52:23] grab the importance, Lord, of being in
[1:52:26] service, Lord, Father, whether we are in
[1:52:28] church, wherever we are, Father God,
[1:52:31] being in your presence. May we grab the
[1:52:34] importance of being conscious of your
[1:52:36] presence, oh God. Oh, Father, Lord,
[1:52:39] because you promise, oh God, that you
[1:52:42] will never leave us, Lord. You will not
[1:52:44] forsake us, oh Father God. Almighty God,
[1:52:48] we have so much around us, Lord. So
[1:52:51] much, Lord. Many voices crying for
[1:52:53] attention, Lord, we have so much, oh
[1:52:56] God, Father. So much pressure that it's
[1:52:59] so easy to blow up. It's so easy to
[1:53:01] misbehave. It's so easy, Father. Lord,
[1:53:04] to say the wrong thing, oh God, Father,
[1:53:06] even when we are thinking the right
[1:53:08] thing, Almighty God, we pray tonight,
[1:53:11] Lord. Oh father, if one hour with the
[1:53:15] beast Lord can give those men so much
[1:53:18] power, Lord, what would happen Lord God
[1:53:20] in the church? Oh father, Lord, just
[1:53:23] take their position, oh God. Oh father,
[1:53:26] we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:29] Christ. In the name of the Lord God
[1:53:31] Almighty, in the name of the Lord God of
[1:53:34] glory. Oh Father God, help us Lord Jesus
[1:53:38] Christ. We thank you tonight, oh God.
[1:53:41] Father, we said, "Oh, precious Lord,
[1:53:44] until we meet again, oh Father God, keep
[1:53:47] us, Lord, Father God, keep us under
[1:53:50] expectation, oh God, keep us, oh Father,
[1:53:53] Lord God, with a heart, Lord, that is
[1:53:55] ready to come and save you, a heart that
[1:53:58] is ready to worship, a heart that is
[1:54:00] ready to praise you, Lord. Oh, Father
[1:54:03] God, let the rejoicing of your word be
[1:54:06] our attitude, Father. May we rejoice in
[1:54:09] your promises, Lord. May we rejoice in
[1:54:11] the things that you beginning to do in
[1:54:14] our lives, that you're beginning to do
