making that voice i don't know praise the lord let's just take our bibles and then we go we go right right to the scripture thank you musicians amen praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah i always say you really did a good job this morning you really preached me well amen and just at the time we were about closing the service that's when i started feeling more anointed to preach let's let's look in the book of first samuel let's look in the book of first samuel i will have to straight a little bit and draw something and praise the lord first time in chapter four i was looking in chapter five but first i'm in chapter four this is something i've i spoke on some time ago but i want to i just want to bring in [Music] first psalm in chapter four let's read from verse three and when the people will come into the camp the elders of israel say wherefore have the laws making us be us today before the philistines let us fetch the act of the covenant of the lord out of shalom unto us that when a comment among us it may save us uh it may save us out of the hands of our enemy so the people sent to shallow that they might bring okay is that a problem okay verse 4 saw the people sent to shallow that they my brain from dance the act of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubians and the two sons of elah okay and the two sons of eli hobnard and finney has were there with the act of the covenant of god and when the act of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth reigns again praise the lord verse seven oh let's let's continue to read from verse six it will help us and when the philistine hear the noise of the shout it said what meaning the noise of this will shout in the camp of the hebrew and the understood that the arc of the lord was come into the camp and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into the camp and they say a war on us for me there have not been such a thing ever praise the lord amen let us pray father we will ask you blessing upon the word now and we just ask the lord god you will bless this portion of the service in jesus name amen baby the lord bless you may have a seat praise the lord okay i think it's much better now tonight i said i was going to to talk on the importance of the uh the three arguments of the new testament church water baptizing communion and food washing man i would not be able to go okay okay now i will not be able to go into uh everything that i have tonight not to keep you long but i want i want to go this way uh uh i think sometime back we we spoke a little bit on the the the shout of the king in the camp now uh uh we just read the scripture where the they brought brother act of the covenant in the camp of israel and the people shouted and even the philistine school identified by thou shalt that that the lord god was in the camp of israel praise the lord amen that the lord god was in the camp of israel now and and speaking on that we were able to identify by scripture that israel had five supernatural things by the scripture and also by the message of the hour there were five supernatural things that accompanied israel praise the lord they had the act of the coveting now we just read it by the act of the covenant that was one of the spiritual things that they had and they had uh the smitten rock the raqqa uh the moses struck a god's instruction and a broth for water paul who allude to that in the book of corinthians says the rock that followed israel in the wilderness was christ praise the lord so israel had the ark of the covenant they had the smitten rock they had the brazen serpent praise the lord they had uh a vindicated prophet and there's a fifth one what would that be yes they have the pillar of fire that's right that was the fifth thing they had the pillar of fire will will become fire by night and cloud by day praise the lord okay those were the five supernatural things that israel had now god equipped his people by giving them these things praise the lord the the the and because these things were in the camera of israel they all had their representation what they meant to to the wilderness church we will look at it a little bit and uh [Music] you realize that these were just uh jacob and his family households sevens that went down to egypt they stayed there and and they grew to be just this small group of people so they were not uh uh mighty i mean they never even had an army they were just a group of people there were there were seven slaves there in egypt and just at the time of the exeter god came down and he spoke to moses we know the story then he commissioned moses to go and get his people out into the land of promise they will stop the adjoining and then god will now uh equip his people he will he will he will come about them with these five supernatural things praise the lord now you will you will realize that uh beside what paul said in the book of corinthians that the rock that followed them was christ there is nowhere that is uh uh you know is written in the scripture that the rock was rolling and following them right praise the lord amen paul only said that to be able to help us to see the significance praise the lord to be for us to be able to see the significance of those elements that we're giving them i mean not seeing the significance not seeing the importance of it is is uh it's easy for the people to idolize it like we said on wednesday night praise the lord we also realized that the brazen serpent was christ because jesus himself pointed to death as moses lifted up the brazen serpent so the son of man will be lifted up praise the lord the pillar of fire was christ are we together amen and even the act of the covenant because what did they had in the act of the covenant they had the the tablets which was the word now so uh the prophet will help us to understand that when when uh uh uh balad brought balaam and he was trying to to ring curses on these people and uh and and and bilaam went on top of the mountain and uh brother branham would describe it and said that you know balak tried to carry him to a place where he would now he will be able to see in the camera of israel and see all the little easings and see the fusses that were going on and see you know all their backsliding try to bring this man to a place where he will be able to see all the weaknesses and based on thy weaknesses he will now bring down curses on the children of israel praise the lord took him to a very high place that he will be able to see very clear and as high and and as high as high as he went he could see nothing now the way brother branham described it brother branham said is that what was the pillar of fire that led them by night became a pillow of cloud that rolled behind the camera of israel he says the pillar of cloud wrote behind the camera of israel that bilaam could not see anything in the camp because god was now the covering of his people praise the lord now so we i i'm saying this to bring us to the place to realize that uh the one that have caught us is the one that keeps us praise the lord is the one that keeps us i know we we uh sometimes like to to to refer to uh uh uh king message in the book of uh uh genesis and say we have to be our brother's keeper i told somebody before i said king was the one that preached that message it's now scripture in the scripture the bible says the lord is our keeper king was the one that said am i my brother's keeper he was asking god now so what i'm trying to bring to us tonight for us to understand is that uh god did not give us his word as uh you know uh uh uh you know uh uh a commandment in a sense of uh uh you know you have to keep this word if you don't keep this word you know i'm going to blot you out and and you know uh give us his word as something to enslave us just like the scripture says no man is justified by the lord the same one that has given us his word his ordinance and his commandment is the same one that has come in the form of the holy spirit that dwelleth in a believer to keep the word he's a jealous god it's all about him if you take god out of the picture you're going to get it wrong we have to see him in every every every aspect of the picture praise the lord now so we realize that brother branham uh uh uh taught us and says that the uh the brazen serpent represented uh um divine healing amen so even when god started dealing with his people when he called them paul says the church in the wilderness when he called him he gave them a covenant of healing he established something in the camp because these people are now traveling adjoining the where they have never been before they are going through the wilderness and he is the great physician in the camp to be able to keep them healthy for them to continue this journey and that same god is also in our camp he knows that have we have never traveled this road before so he's the lord that he left us of all our diseases praise the lord the smitten rock that followed the turn of israel paul says it was christ now what jesus said he said these signs shall follow so the the the the smitten rock see the position of the smitten rock you i will soon get to where i want to get tonight the people were in they were in need it takes the place of the place where signs and wonders takes in the new testament church because just as the rock followed the people jesus says signs will follow the church the church do not follow signs but signs follow the church is the presence of christ he's the one that does the wonders in the midst of the people whenever we have spiritual needs now so just like the church in the wilderness god established these things among the people for us to be able to realize that they are more with us than we ourself and even them that are against us the church is is a mystical body praise the lord we can all bring our little lake of fires together tonight like we we have done we can bring our our gather all our faith tonight we need his faith amen amen we need his faith to create a hundred percent faith in this building where all things are possible it's where christ come and join to the body that's when the impossible happens so just like how the old testament church had these supernatural things that was dwelling in the camp in the in in the evening as the evening shadows are falling the the the pillar of fire move over the people and brighten the camp and israel continued their journey or if they are going to encamp and sleep and whatever they are going to do but god there with the people this way creating a a a place for the for them to have confidence in his presence praise the lord now to the new testament church jesus establishing a new covenant with his church we know uh uh the ordinance of water baptism was was given right right from uh john he started to preach repaint for the kingdom of heaven is a hand amen and he started to baptize the people for john baptized onto repentance and and then jesus came in and took the message of repentance also and started to preach out repent the kingdom of heaven is a hand now there is there is there is this thing that uh uh we we we also see it in the scripture and in the message that uh you know when when brother branham uh had a vision one time uh when he was going out in his ministry where there were there were two plans that were before him and and he broke uh a branch from each one of these plants and he was going to plant them together almost like a grifter barn he was going to graft him together and what uh and what that represent the interpretation of that uh vision it was that he was going to stand between the trinitarians and the oneness right praise the lord and he was going to bring uh uh a perfect understanding on the godhead praise the lord now so uh because there there there are people out there also that uh you know believe in uh water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ you know the the one that does that the united pentecostal does that and and different pentecostal group that also do that now but here he said a prophet was going to come and bring and bring us a true interpretation or the the importance of what this was giving to the the the new testament church when jerome started preaching and and uh he he spoke in a sense the other the the kingdom of heaven you know uh it's unto you repent be baptized the kingdom of heaven unto you now so we realized that like brother branham says water baptism actually put the believer into the body it makes the believer is identified with both the death barrier and resurrection of jesus christ praise the lord now here is the danger also that has happened all through the church ages you realize that uh uh you know where brother branham shaves the oneness got it wrong because they were establishing something like in jesus name you know a jesus name group and they were baptized in jesus name and he says uh they were not doing it in a scriptural way because it had to be in the name of the lord jesus christ praise the lord now the the the reason there also is that uh when the person is is baptized you have to know like uh uh peter said baptism give us a good conscience towards god amen it does not put away the fit of the flesh it gives us a good conscious towards god it's a commandment of the lord and in obedience to god's word he promised that he will bless us with the holy ghost so when we when we come in our confession to be identified with the death burial and resurrection that that is what we are doing we we are identifying ourselves with that body of jesus christ praise the lord now over the years the churches has used it in a sense of being a member of a church you got to be baptized to be a member of the church the structural approach is that we are being baptized to be identified with his death his burial and resurrection and that's the reason why repentance is important praise the lord now when a person comes with a mindset that i want to be part of this church you know in a message you got to be baptized in jesus name to be part of the local church that's the only way you can now so it's just only a church mind praise the lord and maybe uh uh uh you know uh get baptized because you know the the scriptures that get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you know they want to be part of the church all right yeah i mean that's that's uh the first thing you have to do the next in venice communion they have all of these church elements and and and programs on their mind and how they can be part of the body of that local church and not actually fulfilling what the word is requiring praise the lord amen take it take take it in in the light of the word like brother brandon preach the message the creator of sin and the penetrator it took to get to read sin out of our life now if it is approached at a place where we know that we are being identified with that body and what and and the kind of a price that he pays and he went through all of that i mean under no condition a person would want to go into the water to be a wet sinner and come out i mean a dry sinner and come out as a wet sinner but you see over the years and it's all the effect of catholicism church owner stays on the minds of the people and as long as church stays on our mind the word becomes of no effect praise the lord god promised that if we are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we will receive the gift of the holy ghost it's because the people just want to be identified with a church they want to be called you know that now this person is a believer and after that they can learn all the dress code they can learn all the you know the behavior that comes to the church but you see if there is no death if not as a sense of death have hit the sinful nature you go and identify in water baptising and then you still have all of your battles and struggles and all that praise lord am i saying tonight the whole church need to be re-baptized no that's not what i'm saying i'm not saying that you have to examine your baptism nope that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying is that the importance of these ordinances was not to bring us to a church that importance was to put us in christ praise the lord was to put us in christ now the old missionary brother good friend of mine one time he was over i think over in south korea was sold in and uh i mean at the time he was taking the message in that area and then he was sharing you know after uh most of those people has uh you know uh has have some form of uh pentecostal things you know with them you know and and and you know and when the truth of water baptism came i mean to them it was not a problem because many of them was baptized in jesus name but the problem there is that even among the elders of the church it was still difficult for them to get over certain things struggling with adultery and different things was happening in their life and all of them so he was sharing why he said i kept wondering why i mean why god promised you know you baptized in jesus name uh uh you know you received the gift of the holy ghost why are these brothers not why are they not overcoming he says then i realized that all of the organization that they were they were in that god that they got baptized in it was a way to be identified with the church are you grabbing the concept when you are baptized in jesus name in the name of the lord jesus christ is not to be identified with the church is not to be identified with the message is to be identified with the death barrier and resurrection of jesus christ until that is dreaming home not just to take a church identification then you get stuck under that church spirit and like most of the churches would do they will have baptizing class to tissue their doctrine and tissue you know what they believe and all they are doing they are just immersing you into the system is not in the body of christ but this thing was given to the church for us to be identified with the body and that's the reason why the early church had they had an immediate result because they were not bringing the people to an organization they were bringing the people to christ they were bringing the people to a raising christ so when they when they when they take them down the water they baptize them it was an immediate effect immediate result but what is on the minds of most of us preacher is to make this person a member of my church now you read the message of desperation brother branham brother branham let me let me take something here then praise the lord but jordan i'll send a note back there i don't know let me let me just read that bert rams uh spoke this uh on uh hebrews series and then he also mentioned there on communion i was i was also trying to look into my notes on the kid of the door where he he spoke a whole lot about it now so i just sat there to be able to cover the baptism part of it we have been identified with his body praise the lord when a young believer goes down into the water he must be able to uh uh be brought to the place where he is he's identifying himself lord jesus you die on the cross for my sin praise the lord amen he must he must be he must be in that mindset is is i mean with the grace of god if the person is i've been taught right i mean if god is dealing with your heart it's not when they just want to measure themselves up with the rest of the other believers and you know and just want to know okay now he's a believer you know now we can call him brother john because we have to know that we have the full benefit if we are in the body amen that was the first fruit from the dead and that's the reason why we have the hope in us that we will rise again because we are in that body we are identified with their body in baptism we are being placed in the body by the baptism of the spirit that's the only place where god places his name that's why we have our healing that's what our resurrection is our rapture is in our body it's not in the four walls of the church praise the lord brother branham speaks here on this uh uh on this thought let's press a little bit on it we are kings and priests together what difference does it make whether we have all whether we having as long as we got god we are more than conquerors we are more than conquerors he says we sit in the presence of god in the fellowship of the holy of the holy spirit taking spiritual communion from the hands of him that testified i was he that was dead and it's alive again and i'm alive forevermore sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus now brother brother branham yet is alluding to the sense of spiritual communion that's what we do when we are in the fellowship in the church we are in church service just as we are now under the preaching of the word praise the lord we have we we are feeding right from the hands of the master we are having fellowship with the holy ghost spiritual communion praise the lord now down here uh communion brother brandon referred to that i was called on a few days ago of some uh verifying christian gentleman that never had this and he understood that we were thinking communion literally they take it what they call spiritual communion and which as far as communion and they said it's all right because communion is to talk to see and the brother gave me this scripture and says brother branham you know well uh he gave brother branham a scripture i didn't add any idea but i just took those two two two calls uh to uh kind of print the sense of spiritual communion and but with this sense also there are many like i said this morning you know even even around the message i mean there are a lot of churches you know around the world that they don't even practice baptism most churches especially when you go in the realm of uh uh the character churches they are more basic on healing you know prosperity and you know that's i mean that's that is where their doctrine is lining up nothing had to do with the body of christ nothing have to do with the places of the people those things is not for them it's all that god promised them god said he's going to prosper them he's going to bless them they're going to lay fine you know that's all they just push out there nothing about any otherness any scriptural ordinance they don't give that to the people but also uh to uh uh churches that like laid on uh on uh on the scripture make emphasis on the scripture you realize that you know just and and and as i said i mean i got i got uh touched with this with this uh uh thing on my heart is because i went into an area and i realized that you know all of these believers people been believing the message for 10 plus 10 years and and the pastor just believed that his church is not qualified to have convenient service and nobody in the church is qualified to have communities praise the lord you see how we can we can rest heavily on works right and what we are trying to achieve and it's it's it's all it's all in our mind that we're trying to this is where we want to get the church you are you it's all on human efforts i mean it's it's said bowling from behind the poop as far as i'm concerned there's nobody in this church that is qualified for communion what you are doing is that you are trumping on the blood of jesus christ right you are saying that blood was not sufficient you need something better than the blood of jesus christ that's what you are doing sure that's right praise the lord that's what you are doing if a minister would do that that's what he's doing he's trumping on the blood of jesus christ and if a believer will do that yeah this is i'm not i'm not yet qualified for you praise the lord whatever you need to be qualified you better go find it right that's right praise the lord amen you better go and find it right because what is happening here is data is word we we i mean we we are all caught up in this thing and thinking that we are doing something for the lord and so we we have to bring you know a a a sacrifice that is acceptable we are right back to catholicism right right back to capitalism we have we are creating pennies for ourselves the only thing that we are now working on grab bottles on breaking bottles we are not stripping our hair to the but we we are affecting our mind we are limiting ourselves from the blessings praise the lord in the same sense we are not supposed to come and partake of the communion when we realize that we're not living right right that's a clear-cut instruction in the word of god that instruction is there in the word of god well you see that our our our our taking of the comedian our uh being accepted in the beloved is not on our works you have to realize is the sacrifice that is on our examination is not the worshipers it's the sacrifice that is on an examination you see what we do is that we replace it we make christ the worshiper and we make ourselves the sacrifice sure because we we think that we need to be a zombie praise the lord and this thing is not right in my life and this thing is not right in my life and this thing is not right in my life you are limiting the you are limiting the power of god you know what the word of god says repent then repent so what i wanted to draw to tonight is that i'll find timing and be able to take you through coaching and scripture to really be able to establish this but just like how israel had those spiritual elements just imagine god is telling them you go and take the the land and these people are going just with their children husband wives and and you know just follow they are not an army and they are going to conquer nations yeah what is doing that conquering for them is not the stakes that they have in your hand it's a god that is that have promised he said i will send honest before you he even promised that he would come down and fight for them praise the lord now that is the same that is the same way this spiritual element is to the new testament church right when we are identified in that body we know that he was bruised for our iniquity by the chastity by the the uh the the chaste man we're supposed to have peace by his tribes we are healed we know that it was all he took all in their body praise the lord so we can claim our healing because we are identified in that body we can have victory over our weaknesses praise the lord because we are identified with that body what the enemy will always do is that he will keep making you to look at yourself when you are supposed to be looking at christ praise the lord now so just like how those spiritual elements created the shout of the king when he brought the act of the coveting the people yelled because they know the presence of god was in the camp and even the philistines identify it and say god is in their midst that's the same thing when the new testament church gets down to uh uh the reality of this we don't make the bread the literal body of jesus christ the only thing we know that is an unliving bread because living must not be mixed living represents sin so it takes is that symbol of unleavened bread we know there is some living bread it's being baked with prayer that's right praise the lord amen the one that is doing it we know that we trust and know the life that they are letting and we know that they will follow the the scripture of them and they will make it with prayer now because it's based on the word we can come by faith and identify with it it's not the piece of prayer we are identifying with it's the commandment of the lord because jesus said do this in remembrance that's right praise the lord desperation brother branham says there is healing in the communion but you see when when uh the devil can guess the place the the the people to the place and think that we are now walking we are not qualified sure praise the lord what he's doing is that he's robbing them of the spiritual benefit right praise the lord because even as a pastor of a local church that's what i look for after the communion service i see i see what god does yes sir because uh i mean we it's not like we just we just make it a routine every first sunday it must be every first sunday night sometimes we need we need their spiritual help amen and as just as i will bring in uh our ministers and says yeah come and give us tedious revival let evangelists preach and rebuild sin that's the scene where i'll say deacons let's have communion sure praise the lord because what i'm doing is that i'm bringing this local local assembly to be identified with a portion of the world and i'm claiming every blessings that goes there yes for the people praise the lord right in this local church identified god delivering somebody delivering somebody and just before the communion i called them to the office and we talked a couple of years back and i said to them you know we've been praying about this i don't know how you feel tonight i don't know if you are going to be part of the communion he says yeah i was thinking about i was praying and praying about it and says well okay what i want you to do is i want you to approach that table by faith and say lord i'm identifying myself with your body tonight i'm placing this thing in your hands amen yes praise the lord and the rest is a testimony so it is not just to fulfill a church ritual no amen we need all the help that we need brother branham says he says the new testament church i mean uh uh uh believes so much so much in communion that it would not even take an elderly sister to be a widow if she's not partaking of comedian he says paul told trinity don't count them a widow if they are esteeming from communion in a sense that it means that they are not living right sure praise the lord we can take the communion for granted and just come to the table of the lord with unconfessed saints in our life and you know and and and gracious and bitterness and different things no we must not do that we must take our house before the lord amen sometimes the most things that are troubling you that the enemy keeps using to block you with that's what you should bring to a communion bring you to a communion service praise the lord because there is healing in the communion the lord bless you tonight let's pray when moses instructed him for the passover he's a alarm to a house [Music] alarm to a house [Music] and in that same sense we come tonight as we are identifying with this you can claim your loved ones

stopped saying this cup is the new testament of my blood this do you as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord on walter lane shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of their bread and drink of that cup for he that eat it and drink it on walter and eat it and drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body praise the lord [Music] thank you on [Music] so john chapter 3 chapter 13 verse 2. you know as i was reading the scripture just now i was running through my mind paul talking about jesus that same night he took the bread he broke it now you have to remember that judas was in that meeting tonight or he was in that meeting that night and jesus knew the one that would betray him [Music] and yet he did he told them there's one year that would be training you know what the word said to do this said whatever you have to do go and do it praise the lord [Music] saint john 13 verse 2 and when sought and suffered being ended the devil having pulled into the heart of judas's heart simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and lay aside his garment and took a towel and gather himself after that he poured water in the basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to weapon and to weld them with the tower where he was given then coming here to simon peter and peter said unto him lord does thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do there knoweth not now but thou shalt know yeah after peter said unto him thou shall never wash my feet jesus answered him if i washed thee now they have no part with me simon peter said unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said unto him he that is washed needed now saved to wash his feet but it's clean everywhere and yeah i claim but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said yeah i'm not acclaimed and after he have washed their feet and have taken his garment and was set down again he said unto them know here what i have done unto you you call me master the lord and he said well for so i am if i then your lord and master has washed your feet you also ought to wash one another for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done verily verily i say unto you the seven is not greater than his law
