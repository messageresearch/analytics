[1:12] He was the sacrifice.
[1:17] I was the take.
[1:22] He was a giver
[1:26] dying while I got free.
[1:31] His one
[1:33] earthly reason was me.

[34:12] have u uh somewhere to stand and read a
[34:17] word this morning, let's take John
[34:19] chapter 6.
[34:28] Praise the Lord.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; John chapter 6,
[34:35] let's drop down to uh uh
[34:44] verse 32. John 6 verse 32.
[34:51] John 6 verse 32.
[35:01] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[35:03] verily, I say unto you, Moses give you
[35:06] not that bread from heaven,
[35:11] but my father giveth it, giveth you the
[35:14] truth bread from heaven. For the bread
[35:17] of God is he which cometh down from
[35:21] heaven and and give life unto the word.
[35:27] Then said they unto him, Lord ever more
[35:30] give us this bread. Now you think about
[35:34] that and then uh uh two chapters back
[35:37] the same thing. It was a water to the
[35:39] woman at the word to these people is a
[35:41] bread. He says I will give you water.
[35:43] You come yet and you will not drink
[35:45] again. She says, "Give me thy water."
[35:47] Now, yeah, he's talking about, "I will
[35:49] give you a bread, you know, uh, and then
[35:52] when you eat it, you never get hungry
[35:53] again." Then they said unto him, Lord,
[35:56] evermore, give us this bread.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread
[36:01] of life.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; He that cometh to me shall never hunger,
[36:08] and he that believeth on me shall never
[36:11] thirst. But I said unto you that
[36:15] ye also have seen me and believe not.
[36:23] All that the Father giveth me shall come
[36:26] to me. And him that come to me I will in
[36:32] no wise cast out.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; I will in no way cast out. For I am come
[36:42] down from heaven, not to do my own will,
[36:45] but the will of him that sent me.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; And this is the father will which have
[36:50] sent me that of all which he has given
[36:54] me, I should lose nothing.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; I wish I was hoping that we will all
[37:02] claim ourself in there. Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:07] uh uh he's talking about you and uh and
[37:09] you have to believe it. I can't believe
[37:11] it for you.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it for yourself.
[37:14] Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; I read that again. And this is the will.
[37:20] This is the father will which have sent
[37:23] me that of all which he has given me I
[37:28] should lose nothing.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But should rise up
[37:34] again. rise it up again in the last day.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We get so used to hearing these
[37:44] things that uh uh we hear them over and
[37:47] over and it's so easy to relax in it and
[37:50] not really, you know, uh uh uh place
[37:54] oursel there, grab it, rejoice in it.
[37:56] Praise the Lord.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; And uh uh let's continue to read uh
[38:00] verse 40. This is the will of him that
[38:02] sent me that everyone which seeth the
[38:07] son.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Is there something that you see in there
[38:12] &gt;&gt; on Wednesday night?
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Everyone who seeth
[38:17] &gt;&gt; the sun.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; The first house rather said come and
[38:23] see.
[38:25] When the woman of the word when uh
[38:28] predestinated sea was quickened in her
[38:30] she said come and see the man
[38:33] &gt;&gt; that have told me the things that I have
[38:36] done. Now so uh Jesus is saying here
[38:42] and this is the will of him that sent me
[38:44] that everyone which seeth the son
[38:48] &gt;&gt; and believeth on him. Now you have to
[38:51] remember it's the same thing that God
[38:53] told Abraham.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Look at the heavens.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever you see, I give it to you.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; You have to see it.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; He told Nicodemus the same thing. Until
[39:04] you are born again, you will not see
[39:07] &gt;&gt; the kingdom.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; It's not just to believe it. You know,
[39:13] &gt;&gt; not not to believe it by birth or
[39:15] believe it by joining or believe it by
[39:18] association, but you have to see it.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Now, so he's saying it here. He that
[39:27] seeth the son uh uh uh uh and believe on
[39:32] him may have everlasting life, and I
[39:36] will raise him up in the last day.
[39:39] Praise the Lord.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; We can all say, "Open the eyes. Open the
[39:44] eyes of my heart, Lord.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Let me see it."
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Because it will not do any good to you
[39:51] &gt;&gt; until you see it.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Until you see it, it won't do any good
[39:58] to you
[39:59] &gt;&gt; until you see Calvary.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Calvary won't do any good to you. You
[40:03] can hear about Calvary. You can you can
[40:06] uh uh uh you know look at the the
[40:08] picture of Calvary, but until you see
[40:10] Calvary, and I pray this morning that
[40:13] you will see the sun.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; You will see the son. For unto us a
[40:21] child is born, unto us a son is given.
[40:26] That son is the gift of life.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, in the name
[40:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ, we come with
[40:36] our fever body this morning and uh and
[40:39] and we just trusting ourself in your
[40:42] hands, Lord.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Father God, and uh I'm sure this
[40:46] morning, Lord, uh we all be help from
[40:49] you.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And if there is one that needed most,
[40:52] I'm the one, Father, I pray that Lord,
[40:54] you'll be merciful. You'll be gracious.
[40:57] Lord, I want to stand. Oh God, just like
[40:59] Isaiah, oh God, that that scripture has
[41:02] has really there with me, no father.
[41:05] Lord, yes, that prophet right in your
[41:07] presence, oh God, when he saw the train,
[41:12] he saw something, Lord,
[41:14] &gt;&gt; he changed his attitude.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wo is me."
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Father, I'm I'm not I don't want to
[41:20] repeat him, Lord.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I want to say for myself, "Wo is me. I'm
[41:24] a man of God.
[41:26] I pray that father you would just come
[41:28] this morning and oh God bless your word
[41:31] to our hearts. May something be said
[41:33] that will draw us closer to you. We love
[41:35] you. We appreciate you. We glorify your
[41:38] name. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[41:43] The Lord bless you. The Lord bless you.
[41:45] You may have your seat. Amen. Amen.
[41:49] Amen.
[41:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. What a wonderful,
[42:00] wonderful Jesus we serve. Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; So good to be in the house of the Lord
[42:04] this morning, man. We've been we've been
[42:07] we've been running around with this
[42:09] whole thing on this uh Revelation
[42:11] chapter chapter 6. And uh and there's no
[42:15] time to we don't the finishing is not in
[42:18] sight. Let me just tell you right now.
[42:21] the the the finish line uh is not in
[42:23] sight as yet. So we might run it to the
[42:26] end of the year, maybe to next year,
[42:28] maybe to the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[42:30] Praise the Lord. Finishing is not in
[42:33] sight. And what because what what the
[42:35] reason what I'm trying to go into this
[42:37] is that the uh
[42:42] uh there there are just a whole lot of
[42:45] thing. I'm I'm praying and hoping that
[42:47] uh uh next Sunday I might confirm that
[42:52] on uh Wednesday night but uh next Sunday
[42:57] uh if the Lord tired and give us another
[42:59] time I would just like to talk to the
[43:01] church a little bit when I mean talk to
[43:03] the church we will go offline so if you
[43:05] are not in service on on Sunday we will
[43:08] let you know what we talk about but I
[43:10] would just like to talk to this assembly
[43:12] a little bit and uh
[43:15] U and then
[43:19] uh in the evening of next Sunday we will
[43:22] have a prayer meeting in the community
[43:24] service. Uh but uh Sunday morning we
[43:29] will take the time to just talk to
[43:31] ourselves
[43:33] and uh and and that is some of the
[43:35] reason why I choose to just to just stay
[43:37] this way because I don't want to uh uh
[43:42] you know I'm not a teacher far from a
[43:44] teacher but uh because teaching
[43:47] sometimes makes a person to take their
[43:49] time. You know if you start uh uh you
[43:53] know being angry while teaching then you
[43:55] are completely out of place. You are
[43:58] completely out of place. You have to be
[43:59] relaxed. Amen. So there are just lot of
[44:02] few things and I'll share that with you
[44:03] next week if uh if uh we if we uh you
[44:08] know like I said I will I will remind
[44:11] you Wednesday if we going to have that.
[44:14] But that's that's the plan. That's what
[44:15] is in my mind that I'll be able to talk
[44:18] to you as a church. Uh next week we'll
[44:22] take the pullpit away. Amen. And uh so
[44:25] we'll take the pulpit away. The pastor
[44:27] office will be going away and then we'll
[44:30] talk like brothers and sisters.
[44:32] So this morning
[44:34] I was talking thinking about getting
[44:37] back to uh uh Revelation chapter 6 or
[44:40] what we've been speaking on. Emmanuel, I
[44:42] hope you get my image there. I will I
[44:44] will refer back to that and uh but uh uh
[44:48] I mean every time you look into the
[44:50] subject more thing just come up. So I
[44:54] end up with the the beast and the
[44:57] riders.
[44:59] I end up with the beast and the riders.
[45:01] Now I I was I will tell you why uh I end
[45:05] up with that because uh u
[45:10] I'll show you why I end up with the
[45:12] beast and this. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[45:19] Revelation chapter 6 verse one. We we
[45:22] need to go back to Revelation chapter 4.
[45:25] But the reason why I end up with a beast
[45:27] and rather Revelation chapter uh uh 6
[45:31] verse one, let's uh let's go there.
[45:38] Oh.
[45:44] Revelation 6 verse 1.
[45:52] Hallelujah.
[45:58] 6.
[46:04] And I saw when the lamb opened one of
[46:06] the seal the seals. I heard in it a
[46:10] noise of thunder and one of the four
[46:13] four beasts said said uh come and see
[46:18] one of the four beast saying come and
[46:20] see.
[46:22] And I saw and behold a white horse
[46:27] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[46:30] crown was given to him and he went forth
[46:34] conquering and to conquer. Now uh uh uh
[46:38] when you read this as as every Bible
[46:42] scholar that read this uh in u uh uh
[46:46] throughout the ages have always took
[46:50] this this rather
[46:53] to be the Holy Ghost.
[46:56] And the reason why they took this rather
[46:58] to be the Holy Ghost is because over in
[47:02] Revelation chapter 19, let's turn there.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:14] Amen.
[47:25] Revelation chapter 19 verse uh uh
[47:28] Revelation 19 11 Revelation 19 11
[47:37] Revelation uh 1911 I and I saw heaven
[47:42] open and behold a white horse and he
[47:46] that sat upon him was called Faith. ful
[47:50] and truth
[47:52] and in righteousness he does judge and
[47:56] make war. Now if you if you hear the
[47:58] name of the rather he that sat on this
[48:02] is called faithful and truth. Who do you
[48:05] think that rather is? Jesus Christ.
[48:09] Praise the Lord. Don't be quiet on me.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Don't be quiet on me. You make me sad.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or we go back and stop preaching
[48:22] on you must be born again.
[48:25] And we go back to water baptism. Praise
[48:28] the Lord. You have been reading your
[48:30] Bibles. I don't know why why we we
[48:32] always have the, you know, the the
[48:34] tendency to behave like we are sh we are
[48:37] not really.
[48:40] Praise the Lord.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; So when you hear faithful in truth and
[48:44] in righteousness, he judge and make
[48:47] wall. Who do you think of?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; You think of Jesus.
[48:53] So he's a rather here. So because of
[48:57] this rather
[49:00] all through history
[49:03] scholars have always thought this was
[49:06] the same rather in chapter six.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. Because of the
[49:15] white house. So the thing there is the
[49:18] same rather. So they have always called
[49:21] Revelation 6 rather the the the Holy
[49:25] Ghost
[49:28] and even till today till tomorrow.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see uh uh uh that is the
[49:36] reason why as I was studying
[49:39] sorry I thought about it
[49:43] and I said well uh if we could just we
[49:46] could just run with all of this but it's
[49:49] also good to be able to identify
[49:53] the rather
[49:55] if we can identify the rathers
[49:59] then u uh it would give us uh a a clear
[50:04] picture
[50:06] because
[50:10] the Bible is saying here in Revelation
[50:13] chapter 6,
[50:16] one of the four beasts.
[50:20] Okay. One of the four beasts and uh uh
[50:24] uh and I saw you know uh uh the white
[50:28] house and and the white house also is a
[50:30] beast.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. So there is one full beast and
[50:38] there is an individual that is riding
[50:41] the beast. Now you will know you will
[50:44] also notice that uh uh when you go
[50:48] through this beast you will find that uh
[50:53] uh
[50:55] uh they were they were not identified
[50:57] him that sat on the white house him that
[51:00] sat on the red him that sat on it was in
[51:05] the last age or the last beast that we
[51:08] actually got the identity of the one
[51:11] that is riding this beast.
[51:14] Are we together?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And uh so that is the reason why my mind
[51:22] went on uh uh I said well okay maybe we
[51:25] can go by the way of uh uh the beast and
[51:28] the rabbits. You will soon understand uh
[51:32] as I as I go along here you will soon
[51:35] get a picture of uh of uh what I want us
[51:41] to look at.
[51:44] Praise the Lord.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Now, Emmanuel, if you would just throw
[51:53] my uh one of the quote of the mark of
[51:56] the beast and let's see uh what brother
[51:59] Brandham said here. He says he says,
[52:01] "Watch this beast."
[52:04] It have four different characters
[52:08] in it. Praise the Lord.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel saw the same vision 800
[52:14] years before before B saw the vision. He
[52:19] saw those beasts separated one from
[52:22] another in the beginning of the Gentile
[52:25] ruling. And here they are John seeing it
[52:30] and the end of the gentile ruling. All
[52:33] four of those beasts represent in one
[52:38] seem old devils,
[52:40] demons that possess each kingdom
[52:45] of the Roman down through and the Greek
[52:47] and so forth down through the gentile
[52:50] dispensation has come right down and all
[52:55] met in one beast.
[52:59] So for the father he tells us that the h
[53:03] it have four different character. So
[53:06] what as god is identified by his
[53:09] characteristics the devil is also
[53:12] identified by what
[53:14] &gt;&gt; his characteristics. So for you for us
[53:17] to know that rather then we have to look
[53:20] at the characteristics of him
[53:24] &gt;&gt; that is riding.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Of him that is writing. Even though his
[53:32] name is not given to us, but if we can
[53:35] be able to pick up a clue of his
[53:37] characteristics, then we can be able to
[53:40] identify who is riding this beast.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And let me get your attention very
[53:47] quickly because I'm not yet to tell you
[53:49] stories. We must also realize that we
[53:53] are beast
[53:56] &gt;&gt; and we have a rather
[54:00] we have a rather
[54:06] that's what I want to drive us to.
[54:09] That's why I'm say I'm not here to tell
[54:10] you stories. I'm I'm I'm here for us to
[54:13] be able to look at oursel in the word.
[54:19] We must realize that we have ease. You
[54:21] know, as I was thinking about this, I I
[54:23] thought about it uh in my mind and I was
[54:26] saying to myself, uh uh Jesus
[54:30] just before his crucification in
[54:32] honoring Zachariah prophecy, it was
[54:35] prophesied that he will be riding on a
[54:37] donkey. He'll be riding on an ass. So he
[54:39] gets there and he tell the disciple to
[54:42] go and and I'm thinking in my mind why
[54:47] he never asked for you know uh uh uh you
[54:51] know um for them if if if the prophet
[54:54] said would have said you know he was
[54:56] riding on a white house definitely you
[54:58] have got it. If you have told two of his
[55:01] disciple, go to to to Caesar palace and
[55:04] bring me you know h
[55:08] a white house that no man has really
[55:10] they would have given it to him. Praise
[55:12] the Lord.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet says said it was going to be
[55:15] an ass. It was going to be a donkey. Why
[55:18] a donkey?
[55:20] You well you got to find the answer.
[55:22] I've not seen brother telling us why the
[55:24] donkey. I try to find my own own answer
[55:26] because I'm a donkey.
[55:30] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[55:34] You know, it's it's it's almost like uh
[55:36] you think about it this way. You look at
[55:38] you look at the raven in the in the ark
[55:41] and and uh uh uh Noah sent the raven
[55:44] out. He saw dead body. It started eating
[55:46] all over the place. It never came back.
[55:48] Never did the work. And he sent uh and
[55:50] he sent uh uh uh the dove out. Praise
[55:54] the Lord.
[55:55] So uh uh you read that story a raven
[55:58] gets a very ugly picture in your mind.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; It gets a very very picture is a is a
[56:05] unc is a is a unbeliever is a but then
[56:08] when you guess over to Elijah being fed
[56:11] God never sent dove to feed Elijah.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; God sent Raven
[56:17] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham says God servants
[56:19] those rivets.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Then I says I'm a rivet.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:27] Praise the Lord.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, you can't put God in a
[56:32] box.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; You know, all of these one scripture,
[56:35] theological, one quote, you can't put
[56:37] God in a box.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; He's your creator. You are not his
[56:40] maker.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; You cannot put God in a box.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh that's what I want to get
[56:49] to here now. So thinking about this, I
[56:52] was just thinking about that. says,
[56:53] "Well, I mean, uh uh uh uh it's it was
[56:57] just a sign that God uh uh Christ was
[57:00] going to ride on some of the stubborn
[57:03] people throughout the ages, you know.
[57:06] Maybe that's what the donkey represent.
[57:08] I don't know everything about what it
[57:10] represent, but because uh uh Zachchariah
[57:13] prophesied and Jesus commanded his
[57:15] disciple and the Bible says an eyes that
[57:18] was never never no one sat on it before.
[57:24] And the disciple went to the man and
[57:26] says my master say I should take the man
[57:28] freely give it to him.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Never even asked who is your master?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; He just give it to him.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that stubborn donkey to just
[57:39] follow.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it had any any stubbornness in
[57:44] it at that moment under the command of
[57:46] the master, it must obey. Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And and uh as as we
[58:02] continue to uh talk on on on uh on this
[58:05] here, let me just let me just wake up
[58:07] myself a little bit. Amen. Let me wake
[58:09] up myself a little bit. Praise the Lord.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] And uh uh we we sang that song of the
[58:17] water where you you see right there the
[58:20] uh uh you know uh Eliza took a bunch of
[58:24] came to go and pick up Rebecca. Praise
[58:26] the Lord.
[58:29] And brother Brandon in a type would tell
[58:31] us that uh uh uh Rebecca had to
[58:37] she had to to to service those candles.
[58:40] She had to give them water to drink and
[58:43] fill them and and and there were many.
[58:45] It was not just one candle. I think I've
[58:47] showed you in the scripture before that
[58:50] uh it was not just uh uh uh Eliza went
[58:53] with men.
[58:56] Praise the Lord.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I show it to you in the scripture
[58:58] before. Can you remember that?
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The reason why Eliza was the only
[59:03] one mentioned because he was the one
[59:04] that had a commission. Right?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; But according to Jewish uh uh custom in
[59:10] wedding, there have to be people that
[59:11] witnessed the wedding
[59:13] &gt;&gt; up to 10 men.
[59:16] So if you read Genesis 24 carefully,
[59:18] you'll find out that uh there were men
[59:20] that were also there with Eliza.
[59:24] So all of those men have came and and
[59:27] and Rebecca had to to service all of
[59:30] those came. Praise the Lord. But this is
[59:33] what brother Brandham said out of the
[59:35] out of all of that. Uh he said that uh
[59:39] uh uh the same came that that Rebecca
[59:42] service was the same came that wrote her
[59:44] to Isaac.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Now he was talking about beast beast
[59:49] being a power. He talk talked about you
[59:52] know we we are giving service to the
[59:53] Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost that power
[59:55] of God that will take us in the presence
[59:57] of God.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] So, uh uh that's where we are with uh
[1:00:05] with uh with the subject that we want to
[1:00:08] we want to talk about this morning. And
[1:00:11] uh uh I mean u Emmano, if you want to
[1:00:13] put my picture up and uh uh I left my my
[1:00:20] pen my pen in the office there
[1:00:25] now. So uh uh
[1:00:29] this is this is our picture of u of
[1:00:33] revelation chapter 6 both revelation
[1:00:35] chapter 4 revelation chapter 5 and
[1:00:38] revelation chapter 6 that's where we
[1:00:40] will be around as we as we talk about
[1:00:43] this
[1:00:49] okay thank you now so uh uh uh so we see
[1:00:55] here that uh uh
[1:01:00] these rather these uh uh beasts on this
[1:01:03] end have have rather
[1:01:06] and then these beasts on this end it
[1:01:10] looks like they don't have rathers they
[1:01:12] are beasts but we don't see no physical
[1:01:16] rather
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; on it are you getting the picture
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:01:24] revelation chapter Six say him that sat
[1:01:26] on him. Him that sat on the white horse.
[1:01:30] Him that sat. So, so in the picture we
[1:01:35] can see there him that sat even though
[1:01:37] we don't know his name there but there
[1:01:39] is him that is sitting on that beast. So
[1:01:42] he has a he has a visible rather.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:50] this
[1:01:52] this this living creature because
[1:01:54] actually when you actually look in you
[1:01:57] look in in in the concordance you look
[1:01:59] in the Greek these two beasts have
[1:02:02] different definition
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; these ones are mostly defined as living
[1:02:08] creatures and even in one of the
[1:02:11] definition they say humans.
[1:02:15] Now these ones on this side uh uh in
[1:02:19] their definition they are curies.
[1:02:24] Are we together?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; If you are not together yet, just follow
[1:02:33] along.
[1:02:35] And uh so
[1:02:38] so we see here that
[1:02:43] even though till now
[1:02:46] we have not fully identified the rather
[1:02:50] of those beasts.
[1:02:53] But what I want us to do this morning if
[1:02:55] we will be able to get there is to also
[1:02:59] identify the characteristics of this
[1:03:01] beast.
[1:03:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ben.
[1:03:17] I'm supposed to leave it here. I'm
[1:03:18] always putting it in my pocket.
[1:03:21] Thank God I don't carry home.
[1:03:26] I'm supposed to leave it here.
[1:03:30] Put in my pocket and then I leave it in
[1:03:31] the office.
[1:03:33] and then don't remember to bring it back
[1:03:35] now. So, so that's that's what we saying
[1:03:37] here that uh we we want to first look at
[1:03:40] this revelation chapter 4. Let's go
[1:03:41] there quickly. Let's go there quickly.
[1:03:44] I'm uh
[1:03:50] Revelation chapter 4.
[1:03:53] After this,
[1:03:55] after what?
[1:03:58] Revelation chapter 4 starts with after
[1:04:00] this. Meaning what?
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; After the church ages.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; We talk a whole series talking about
[1:04:09] after this from Genesis after this and
[1:04:11] after that after this is uh is your word
[1:04:15] is is uh is your message. This is your
[1:04:18] message. This is the message of the
[1:04:19] hour.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; When we talk about the message of the
[1:04:23] hour, this is what the message of the
[1:04:24] hour is.
[1:04:27] After this, after the church ages,
[1:04:30] I looked and behold
[1:04:34] a door was open in heaven. Jesus
[1:04:37] identified himself as the door.
[1:04:41] So a door open in heaven is a further
[1:04:44] revelation of Jesus Christ. In the
[1:04:46] church ages, we we have seen the
[1:04:49] revelation of Jesus Christ in every age.
[1:04:53] Now after the church ages, there is a
[1:04:55] further revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:59] That's the reason why we can't just
[1:05:01] settle down for water baptism in Jesus
[1:05:04] name
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; as as the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:10] There is more of revelation of Jesus
[1:05:12] Christ that will be revealed in the
[1:05:15] millennium.
[1:05:17] There is more that will be revealed at
[1:05:20] the white throne judgment and all. So
[1:05:22] here we see that a door was open in
[1:05:24] heaven.
[1:05:26] And the first voice which I heard
[1:05:31] was as it were a trumpet
[1:05:35] talking with me
[1:05:38] which said come up heaven. Praise the
[1:05:40] Lord.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; And I will show thee things which must
[1:05:45] be here after. So this come up higher
[1:05:49] has been typed as the rapture. We can
[1:05:51] compare it to the rapture. But in this
[1:05:54] sense, it is not the rapture. It is
[1:05:56] calling us into a higher walk with God.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Where we step out of the place of just
[1:06:06] being satisfied being the church member.
[1:06:08] I'm in the rapture. You are having a
[1:06:10] personal revelation relationship with
[1:06:12] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] You are not you are not tied down to to
[1:06:22] to to one assembly. You can be a son of
[1:06:26] God. Even if they carry you to the
[1:06:27] bottom part of hell, you can still be a
[1:06:30] son of God.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; So immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:06:40] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:06:44] and and one sat
[1:06:47] and one sat on the throne and he that
[1:06:49] sat on the throne
[1:06:52] was was uh to look upon as a jasper and
[1:06:55] satin stones. And there was a rainbow
[1:06:59] around around the throne
[1:07:04] in a sight like onto an emerald. Now I
[1:07:08] could I could really be doing too much
[1:07:10] of reading this morning that I don't
[1:07:12] want to do.
[1:07:14] So I think if we drop down a little bit,
[1:07:17] Amen. if we drop down a little bit
[1:07:20] because when I keep reading I would keep
[1:07:21] making comment
[1:07:24] which of course is all part of what I
[1:07:26] want to say but uh
[1:07:29] let's go down a little bit now so you
[1:07:31] see here when you when you drop down to
[1:07:34] uh revelation 6:6 but let's let's
[1:07:38] identify our scene where is this taking
[1:07:40] place now all that you that we are
[1:07:42] seeing where is it taking place
[1:07:45] praise the lord
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; what is God identifying what is it take
[1:07:49] what is taking place where is it taking
[1:07:52] place
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; yeah heaven that's but another another
[1:07:57] another thing you can we can say when
[1:07:59] you look in the reading where is it
[1:08:00] taking place around the throne
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; around the throne that's the picture I
[1:08:07] want you to grab around the throne
[1:08:11] amen
[1:08:12] why the picture is is is important is
[1:08:15] because of this verse six And before the
[1:08:18] throne there was a seed of glass like a
[1:08:21] crystal and and in the midst of the
[1:08:24] throne and around about the throne were
[1:08:26] four beasts full of eyes before and
[1:08:30] behind. Praise the Lord. Put our picture
[1:08:33] up again, Emmanuel.
[1:08:36] So So you see here now we we we trying
[1:08:38] to find the characteristics of these
[1:08:40] four beasts.
[1:08:43] We're trying to find to really to be
[1:08:45] able to identify them these four beasts
[1:08:49] over and over as we will look at it here
[1:08:52] we will see that they are around the
[1:08:54] truth. So their influence is coming from
[1:08:57] where?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; From the throne.
[1:09:01] So they might not have a physical rather
[1:09:04] upon them, but because they are around
[1:09:08] the throne, so we can seize that
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; their rather is not on them. Their
[1:09:14] rather is in them.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Their rather is in them. And these ones
[1:09:30] they rather it's on them
[1:09:33] where in on is just I'm just creating
[1:09:36] pictures in your mind. Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; I'm creating pictures in your mind. And
[1:09:41] uh and uh and the Bible would let us
[1:09:43] know here verse seven. And the first
[1:09:46] beast was like a lion. Put the picture
[1:09:50] up, Emmanuel. Keep the picture up for
[1:09:52] now. The first beast was a lion.
[1:09:56] Amen. And the second beast was a cuff.
[1:10:02] And the third was the face of a man.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; And uh and uh uh and the fourth beast
[1:10:10] was a flying eagle.
[1:10:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; They were around the throne. And now if
[1:10:20] you trust him all through revelation,
[1:10:23] you will see that they are always around
[1:10:26] the throne.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 verse 6. Keep my picture
[1:10:32] up. Don't don't move it.
[1:10:37] Revelation 5:6. Uh uh uh and I beheld
[1:10:41] and and Lord in the midst of the throne
[1:10:45] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[1:10:49] of the elders to Elam that was slain
[1:10:52] having seven seven horns and seven eyes
[1:10:56] which are the spirit of God sent forth
[1:10:58] throughout all the earth. So you see
[1:11:01] they are around the throne. Are we
[1:11:04] together?
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 verse 8. And when
[1:11:09] he have taken the book, the four beasts
[1:11:12] and the 24 others.
[1:11:15] So when the when the seals were open,
[1:11:17] when he took the book, the four beasts
[1:11:20] and the 24 elders, the Bible says what
[1:11:23] year? Oh, I love this.
[1:11:27] 24 elders fell down before the lamb
[1:11:30] having everyone
[1:11:34] hops and golden v of the sins of the
[1:11:36] prayer. So you see here that you always
[1:11:39] see that they are always in the attitude
[1:11:44] of worship.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 19 you will see that
[1:11:51] uh uh uh
[1:11:54] you'll see
[1:11:57] yeah you'll see that the Bible says they
[1:12:00] are they are they are giving judgment
[1:12:03] also. But what we want to identify this
[1:12:06] so we can keep them in our mind because
[1:12:09] if not we will we will we will we will
[1:12:13] confuse this beast with this beast.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if uh if we talk about the lion
[1:12:25] and we we talk about the beast and the
[1:12:28] rider then we can be able to tell that
[1:12:31] uh there is one that is riding upon the
[1:12:34] lion.
[1:12:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; There is one that is riding upon the
[1:12:42] lion. Now you will you will see here
[1:12:45] that uh uh uh Jesus said the word that I
[1:12:50] said unto you they are life and they are
[1:12:53] spirit.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; So if you take that in principle you
[1:13:00] will realize that uh uh uh worse is the
[1:13:05] vehicle that carries spirits.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] Worse is the vehicle
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; that carries spirit.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said
[1:13:27] there is no weapon
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; formed against you shall prosper.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And what did he say next?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; No tongue.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; When he talks about weapon, the next
[1:13:39] thing he talks about no tongue.
[1:13:43] Because tongue was the first weapon that
[1:13:45] was used.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Tongue was the first weapon that was
[1:13:53] used.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And when that lie was told, it carried a
[1:14:00] spirit
[1:14:03] that troubled Eve and took her away from
[1:14:05] the word.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] Eve and Adam came right from the hands
[1:14:15] of God. You and myself, we are born in
[1:14:18] sin.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; So we are more subject to be influenced
[1:14:23] by words more than Eve.
[1:14:28] We are more subject
[1:14:31] to be influenced by words
[1:14:35] more than Eve. She came right from the
[1:14:37] hands of God.
[1:14:43] Are we together?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the reason why I'm I'm
[1:14:53] saying that is because these guys are
[1:14:55] all vehicle.
[1:14:58] These ones also are all vehicles.
[1:15:05] Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; They are all vehicles. They are carrying
[1:15:08] the power
[1:15:12] and the power that they are carrying uh
[1:15:14] they are also carrying spirit. They are
[1:15:16] also carrying words. We're going to see
[1:15:18] it as we as we go along as we go along.
[1:15:21] But I'm just trying to to uh uh uh
[1:15:27] you know uh uh get a get get us to a
[1:15:30] good to a good place here.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; So we realize that these guys
[1:15:38] from the place at the time they were
[1:15:40] identified. So even even if we if we go
[1:15:43] back to Ezekiel
[1:15:46] when when they were seen in in the book
[1:15:48] of Ezekiel, they was always before the
[1:15:50] throne.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; They were always before the throne. They
[1:15:57] were always is a is uh is uh is uh is an
[1:16:02] anointing is an atmosphere that is
[1:16:04] always before the throne before the word
[1:16:07] in worship.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; In worship. That's the reason why you
[1:16:14] cannot get one of these anointing from a
[1:16:17] theological school.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; No, you can't get it. It comes from the
[1:16:21] throne of God
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; because it's always before the throne.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] Are we together?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; A truth representation of this will
[1:16:38] always bring people to worship.
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; It will always bring people before the
[1:16:46] throne. It will it will bring the people
[1:16:48] to to deliverance.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Two things they can do. Just like we
[1:16:52] will see in Revelation chapter 6, it
[1:16:55] exposes the evil one.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It exposes the evil one. Come and see. I
[1:17:04] will tell you the mystery of this.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Now, so when when we look at this, we
[1:17:24] look at it like this uh uh
[1:17:33] when we look at it in this sense,
[1:17:38] you will see here that uh
[1:17:43] right from the beginning,
[1:17:45] that's what I want I want to labor on.
[1:17:48] That's what I want to do to be able to
[1:17:51] show you that right from the beginning
[1:17:55] when God created man in his image. The
[1:17:59] Bible says in the image of God created
[1:18:03] he him. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Man, the brother Brandon would tell us
[1:18:08] that man has always been God's agent.
[1:18:11] Man was created to be the vehicle of God
[1:18:16] that would bring God's presence to his
[1:18:20] creation.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; When God rested on the seventh day, we
[1:18:27] said that it was a mystery. Amen. Watch
[1:18:30] that seven is always a mystery. It was
[1:18:33] not a a physical rest. It was a
[1:18:36] spiritual rest. It was a change of
[1:18:38] dispensation. Almighty God, spirit God,
[1:18:42] the internal spirit has found a body.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has found a body that he was
[1:18:49] ready to dwell in.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; The internal spirit has made himself a
[1:18:54] vehicle.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Man is God's vehicle.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; God now has a vehicle where he could run
[1:19:03] up the hills.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; He could come down the rivers.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; He had a vehicle.
[1:19:09] that he can do it in.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Every beast must have a rather. That's
[1:19:14] where I'm going with this.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, so it brings it
[1:19:24] brings it brings us it brings it in
[1:19:27] picture to us when you read Genesis 3
[1:19:31] and the Bible says the sub the serpent
[1:19:34] was more subtile than any
[1:19:39] Bible readers, answer me, please.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe brother Lawrence, come and
[1:19:49] leave songs. Let me go back in the
[1:19:51] office. Let the people get under the
[1:19:53] anointing and then I will come back
[1:19:54] again. Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Stop sleeping on me. The Bible says the
[1:19:58] serpent were more subtle than any
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; any beast. Any beast?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; He was subtile
[1:20:07] than any beast.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He was more subtle than any beast.
[1:20:16] So you see, yeah, the the the subtality
[1:20:19] of the serpent put him in a position
[1:20:22] that he could be the vehicle.
[1:20:26] Yeah.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; of Satan,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was the most closer.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; His subtality means that he was close.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; He was just like man. He was upright.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Is that not what the word says?
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That's what the word says.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Because that's why God cursed him and
[1:20:49] say on your belly you will go. Because
[1:20:50] he was upright.
[1:20:53] So he was in a place where he could be
[1:20:57] the vehicle that God could use.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why God sent a
[1:21:05] message is to be able to get a bride
[1:21:07] that is a vehicle in this age what the
[1:21:10] spirit of God can do. Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Not people that will believe the message
[1:21:13] and sit down with denominational idea
[1:21:15] and people that will believe the message
[1:21:17] and we say carry our family spirit, our
[1:21:19] tribal spirit, our national spirit. No,
[1:21:22] no, no, no. This message has come to
[1:21:24] call a bride that will separate herself
[1:21:27] to be the final voice in the final age.
[1:21:30] And to be the final voice, you must be a
[1:21:33] vehicle.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; A people that can be able to run with
[1:21:38] the message of the hour.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Because whether whether we like it or
[1:21:51] not,
[1:21:52] whether we like it or not, you are not
[1:21:55] in a dealership.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; It's only a dealership that car said
[1:21:59] that nobody ride.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; You are not in the dealership.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You have been driven.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; By one spirit or another. That's right.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You have been driven. You You are driven
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; by one spirit or another. You are not in
[1:22:21] a dealership.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Just pack to be amay.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:39] So the Bible says there the serpent was
[1:22:41] more subtit than any beast of the field.
[1:22:45] And uh so we see that uh God was riding
[1:22:49] in Adam and Eve and the serpent here got
[1:22:52] someone that he could ride in. Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; So there he's he's riding Satan down is
[1:23:01] riding down in in the serpent and uh uh
[1:23:05] uh uh
[1:23:09] and then the serpent comes over here to
[1:23:11] Eve and he's challenging her on the
[1:23:15] word.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; They are in they are in a in a in in a
[1:23:19] fight of words.
[1:23:21] They are in a word battle that God
[1:23:23] really said God said God did real God
[1:23:25] really said God really didn't mean what
[1:23:27] he said God said and did God really said
[1:23:30] they are in a battle of words.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; They were speaking the word and all he
[1:23:39] was trying to do is to find China into
[1:23:42] her reasoning.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says uh there's a woman here
[1:23:46] standing before me. He says he's talking
[1:23:48] to her. He says, "All I'm trying to do
[1:23:50] is to just contact your spirit."
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; When Jesus started talking to the woman
[1:23:55] at the word and he says uh you know uh
[1:23:58] uh uh this water and all of that, he
[1:24:00] taught us that all he was doing is to
[1:24:03] just contact the spirit of the woman. So
[1:24:06] Satan here also got Eve into a word game
[1:24:11] and all he was doing is to contact her
[1:24:13] spirit. Find the channel of reasoning.
[1:24:17] For God know that the day you eat of
[1:24:20] these things, you will be like him.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And he sw that seed.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He sold that seed. Just that one seed
[1:24:34] brings the corruption of our body.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; No matter how how many times you bathe
[1:24:40] it in the day, it still smells.
[1:24:45] No matter how many time you feel it,
[1:24:46] it's still weak.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; This is the most lazy part of you. Go
[1:24:52] and build your muscles and do whatever
[1:24:53] you want.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever you what you need to carry
[1:24:57] those muscles is a willing spirit
[1:24:59] within.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; You can get muscles of 100 pound. If you
[1:25:03] don't have a willing spirit within, they
[1:25:04] will become so heavy for you.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; But it just took one word.
[1:25:14] It took one word of the devil
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; to corrupt this flesh.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; You see where we going this morning?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Are you interested?
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Are you on board?
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Let's give the Lord a
[1:25:37] hand of praise.
[1:25:44] It's not uh the usual preaching of uh
[1:25:47] running around. I'm trying to take my
[1:25:48] time. Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; So, that's where I want to go go this
[1:25:56] morning. Uh uh uh as just just want to
[1:26:00] travel in that line to make us to see
[1:26:03] and and and Oh my God, I pray that the
[1:26:07] Lord help us this morning. Amen.
[1:26:13] And as as you look in the word, you will
[1:26:16] see that uh uh you know uh uh uh brother
[1:26:20] Brandham identified that uh
[1:26:28] let's let's look here. Let's read
[1:26:30] something
[1:26:32] from the prophet of God. Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:37] Let's read something from the prophet of
[1:26:39] God. About a people, but we love it.
[1:26:41] Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; We love it. Trying to do God a service
[1:26:46] without it being the word of God. Let's
[1:26:48] let's look here and see.
[1:26:51] You see what he says here. The beast
[1:26:54] from the beginning.
[1:26:56] He was the beast at the Garden of Eden.
[1:27:01] Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; He's the beast at the end.
[1:27:06] So if the beast if the beast at the
[1:27:09] beginning is the beast at the end then
[1:27:14] all he was doing was just changing
[1:27:16] forms.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He was just changing form. When he
[1:27:22] finished using this body he drop it like
[1:27:23] a dead close and he move to the next
[1:27:26] one.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:31] But is it not the same thing that
[1:27:34] almighty God is doing?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's the same thing
[1:27:39] he's doing. He used Abraham after the
[1:27:42] 100 years. He throw Abraham like a dead
[1:27:44] closed down. He pick up Isaac.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; And he used Isaac. It has to be God.
[1:27:52] That's why brother Brandham said, I read
[1:27:54] that to you. It was God in the
[1:27:56] characters of those Old Testament.
[1:27:58] That's why he said in Christ is the
[1:27:59] mystery of God revealed.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; So if the the beast at the beginning
[1:28:12] the beast from the beginning was the
[1:28:14] beast at the garden of Eden.
[1:28:18] Ezekiel come out and says uh that was in
[1:28:21] Eden the garden of God. He was speaking
[1:28:25] to a spirit that was in the the king of
[1:28:28] of of terror.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; And he's pointing he's speaking to that
[1:28:33] spirit and say you were in Eden.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; This arrogant spirit in you was in Eden.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; The garden of God,
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; The beast from the beginning. He was the
[1:28:53] beast at the garden of Eden. He was the
[1:28:55] beast at the end. And show that he is a
[1:28:59] religious person.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; A denomination.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; A religious person. A denomination.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; He love to make you to settle down
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; for little.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:29:18] just for some little experience,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; little sensation,
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; little knowledge,
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; as long as he can make you to settle
[1:29:25] down for that.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Every denomination was once a move of
[1:29:29] God,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; But they settled down.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; For later, instead of desiring more of
[1:29:34] God.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:46] He's a beast at the beginning and it
[1:29:48] shows that he's a religious person, a
[1:29:50] denomination that made a denomination
[1:29:52] and come right through the trail of age
[1:29:55] and uh and prove it to you by the
[1:29:58] scripture that it is. I didn't know that
[1:30:02] till the Holy Spirit gave it to me the
[1:30:05] other day.
[1:30:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where he was talk trying
[1:30:11] to talk about uh preaching the trail of
[1:30:13] the serpent. The beast from the
[1:30:15] beginning is the same beast at the end.
[1:30:17] Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Now, so
[1:30:20] that's where we are this morning. That's
[1:30:22] where we are people. I I I I want to
[1:30:26] remind us all this morning. Praise the
[1:30:29] Lord.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; The word is not getting any better. We
[1:30:34] know that we are in the age as as we
[1:30:38] says over and over over and over the
[1:30:40] creation is waiting for the
[1:30:42] manifestation of the sons of God. That
[1:30:45] manifestation of the sons of God is
[1:30:48] going to be an incarnation of God in
[1:30:50] people on earth
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; and at the same time that is taking
[1:30:54] place on the other side the devil is
[1:30:57] also incarnating his people on earth. I
[1:31:00] don't need to preach it till you go in
[1:31:01] the streets you will see it. There is
[1:31:03] just violence all over us. Human life
[1:31:06] now is just useless. It's just useless.
[1:31:09] It's just in the meaning in the meaning
[1:31:11] that take place. Oh wow. We jump over
[1:31:14] it. We forget that that life has been
[1:31:16] spilled on the ground.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; The house of men are just cruel, bitter,
[1:31:23] evil, savage.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Why is it like that?
[1:31:33] Because there is a possession that is
[1:31:35] taking place on both end. God is
[1:31:38] possessing his people and the devil is
[1:31:40] also possessing his people.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; We have to be conscious
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; of what spirit is riding this body
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; in every action. That's that's what I
[1:31:55] must ask myself.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; What spirit is riding this body?
[1:32:06] Are we together
[1:32:16] now? So we see that.
[1:32:21] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:27] We see the evil beast is the sin that's
[1:32:29] been riding from the beginning. Praise
[1:32:32] the Lord.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] Riding from the beginning. The rider and
[1:32:38] the beast. That's what we talking about
[1:32:41] this morning. So, uh uh Oh, Jesus.
[1:32:48] Lord.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here that um uh
[1:32:56] I was trying to
[1:32:59] I was trying to
[1:33:02] Okay. There there are things that as as
[1:33:05] you as you walk with the Lord, you you
[1:33:07] look in the word, you begin to see.
[1:33:10] Amen.
[1:33:11] When you look in the in the in the in
[1:33:14] the book of Job, you look in the book of
[1:33:17] Job,
[1:33:18] you will see that the last time brother
[1:33:21] Daily was here, he preached to us a
[1:33:23] lesson from Job. Beautiful.
[1:33:26] And uh uh and then after that, you know,
[1:33:29] we were home talking and I was sharing
[1:33:31] with him. I says I says, "Well, uh uh uh
[1:33:34] Job in the letter end says, I know my
[1:33:38] redeemer liveth." Amen. The Bible could
[1:33:41] says that the Lord restore everything
[1:33:43] that he lost. Because when you look in
[1:33:45] in Job beginning, you see the principle
[1:33:48] of restoration because there were four
[1:33:51] four times the evil men came to Job.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; In Job chapter one, it was the the the
[1:33:59] savings. That's they were the first. The
[1:34:01] next was the fire of God. the the the
[1:34:03] next one that came was the the uh I
[1:34:07] think the chariots and the fourth one
[1:34:09] were a great fire.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Now you see you see these things because
[1:34:16] uh uh just in one verse of this Bible
[1:34:20] could be the the lifetime of a man.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like John said, if everything was
[1:34:27] recorded, we would not have a book to
[1:34:28] carry.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:31] So you see God put principles.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; There are principles he put in his word
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; that if we can grab those principles, we
[1:34:41] can be able to unlock
[1:34:45] the supernatural, unlock the blessings,
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; we can be able to unlock a channel to
[1:34:50] walk with God.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Because he put principles here.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; So some of those principles I want us to
[1:34:57] look at uh as we talk about this. So you
[1:35:00] you you look at that you look at that
[1:35:03] because if you don't see it you have to
[1:35:06] see that it is this sin beast that make
[1:35:10] Joseph brothers to be jealous of him.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; He wrote upon them for them to get
[1:35:17] jealous. It is the same beast that been
[1:35:20] riding all through the history.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; If I should get angry with you for no
[1:35:27] reason. Amen. Even if there is a reason,
[1:35:31] the word says the sun must not go down
[1:35:33] on my
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; anger.
[1:35:35] Come on now.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; But if I will have to cherish that to
[1:35:40] live with it,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; then there is a beast that is riding me.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:58] You see, because we we are in a
[1:36:02] spiritual warfare.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; That's that's the scripture I wanted to
[1:36:07] read. Put on the whole armor of God, but
[1:36:08] I keeping it for next Sunday.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; That's what I went over to to what I
[1:36:15] whatever I was reading now. So uh uh uh
[1:36:19] you know uh uh
[1:36:22] we are in a spiritual warfare.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; We are in a spiritual warfare.
[1:36:34] Brother Brand would tell us that this
[1:36:35] this battle that has been fought is
[1:36:37] between right and wrong. Is between
[1:36:40] health and sickness. Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; It's between joy and sadness.
[1:36:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Good and bad.
[1:36:51] That's the battle that we are fighting.
[1:36:53] And just like I said, there is nobody
[1:36:56] that is neutral.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; There is nobody. You might not be
[1:37:01] fighting the battle that I'm fighting.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; But you have your battle.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I like to say it this
[1:37:12] when we are all fighting the same enemy
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; but from different fronts.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; I'm asked to keep the east gate, you are
[1:37:22] told to keep the west.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; It's the same enemy.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; If I rejoice in your death, which mean
[1:37:30] the west gate is open
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; and I might be dead soon.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; So what is the benefit of rejoicing in
[1:37:37] your death?
[1:37:40] What is the benefit?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; And rejoicing that you are conquered
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; when I could be dead soon
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; because now the territory is
[1:37:50] compromised. Nobody is protecting the
[1:37:52] west gate.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Because you supposed to be there and now
[1:37:56] you are conquer.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:08] Now, so when you look at it, you'll see
[1:38:11] that it was the same enemy.
[1:38:15] God was just he was giving us a picture
[1:38:18] how the same beast tried to destroy the
[1:38:21] life of this man called Job.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Of this man that had the fear of God in
[1:38:27] his generation, a man that that assumed
[1:38:30] evil.
[1:38:34] He tried to to to to to destroy
[1:38:37] everything around him.
[1:38:40] It just it was just the same piece
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; moving from one to another.
[1:38:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; You look at the picture, you read it in
[1:38:49] the Bible, it just you know, it just it
[1:38:52] looks so horrible.
[1:38:55] It's not a fairy tale.
[1:38:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; It's not a fairy tale.
[1:39:02] Because because it comes from one verse
[1:39:05] to another. The Bible talks and and and
[1:39:08] and another and another seven came.
[1:39:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And another seven came and said, Job, we
[1:39:18] were we were doing this and the fire and
[1:39:20] another seven. Because we read it like
[1:39:23] that,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; we don't see the time spans between the
[1:39:27] verses.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't see the time span.
[1:39:38] Could all of that happen in one day?
[1:39:40] Yes, of course it can happen. Praise the
[1:39:42] Lord.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; A whole village and and everybody that
[1:39:48] was in a village were burned in one day.
[1:39:49] It can happen
[1:39:51] where there time spent between it that
[1:39:54] also possible.
[1:39:57] But what I'm saying is that uh just a
[1:40:00] few verses must not take the reality. It
[1:40:04] must not make us to lost the principle
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; the principle of the sin beast just
[1:40:14] changing his form moving from one evil
[1:40:17] to another.
[1:40:19] What what did Jesus says? The devil
[1:40:21] comes to do what? Steal, kill, and
[1:40:24] destroy. It's the same devil. He's the
[1:40:25] one that is stealing. He's the one that
[1:40:27] is killing. He's the one that is
[1:40:28] destroying.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; He's the same.
[1:40:33] It's the principle right there.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Now, so when you look at that,
[1:40:50] you look at that,
[1:40:52] you realize here that the
[1:40:55] All glory be to God.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Man, I'm feeling so good. I feel like
[1:41:04] speaking in tongues. I just say, Lord,
[1:41:07] pour your spirit upon me. Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Pour your spirit upon me.
[1:41:20] Now, you look in you look in the book of
[1:41:22] Job. Uh just just just be there. Don't
[1:41:24] don't uh don't don't worry about it. I
[1:41:26] just want to uh
[1:41:29] the Lord speak to Satan here and verse
[1:41:32] 13. There were just things I was things
[1:41:34] I was looking at this morning. A lot of
[1:41:37] numbers were just playing in my head. I
[1:41:39] said no, I don't want to go that route.
[1:41:41] Uh or else I will bore the people. Verse
[1:41:43] 13. And there was a day when the sons
[1:41:46] and the daughters his sons and his
[1:41:48] daughter were eating and drinking wine
[1:41:51] in their other brother's house. And
[1:41:53] there came a messenger
[1:41:56] uh uh unto Job and said the uh the oxen
[1:42:00] were plowed in the ashes were feeding
[1:42:02] himself and and the sabers fell upon
[1:42:05] them and took them away. Yeah. They they
[1:42:07] slain all your servants with the ash of
[1:42:10] the sword and I and I alone I'm escaped
[1:42:16] alone to tell thee. Now, so if you look
[1:42:20] at that, you see at every at every at
[1:42:23] every uh uh attack of the enemy, one
[1:42:26] person escape.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; At every attack of the enemy, one
[1:42:32] person. It's just a principle that God
[1:42:34] is putting in his word.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; That no matter what happen, he will
[1:42:38] always have a witness.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; It's a principle of witness.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:46] It might not definitely mean only one
[1:42:48] person survive. It just a principle of
[1:42:51] witness
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; that God will always have a witness.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; So you see the uh is is is the same
[1:43:04] beast this beast that is riding you know
[1:43:08] uh and and and and uh uh we we can look
[1:43:10] at the picture from God's side also. It
[1:43:13] is God that is proving his seven job. He
[1:43:16] say he's my man. He's my boy. He's my
[1:43:18] son. He's my you know my person in this
[1:43:21] age. Uh he's not going no matter what
[1:43:24] the trial is. He's not going to to to to
[1:43:27] turn his back on me. Amen. He's not
[1:43:29] going to curse me.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Job never knew anything
[1:43:33] about it. But I'm just trying to show
[1:43:35] you the principle here. The same beast
[1:43:37] that is writing. The reason why I came
[1:43:40] up to this is because brother B would
[1:43:42] tell us in the book of Joy the Palmer
[1:43:46] wound, the kanga wound, the caterpillar
[1:43:48] and the locust. He said it was just the
[1:43:50] same beast that was changing forms.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; It was just the same beast that was
[1:43:57] changing form.
[1:43:59] And then when we read that the beast
[1:44:01] from the beginning is the beast in the
[1:44:03] end.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; It's the same beast.
[1:44:10] So all through the ages, all through the
[1:44:12] ages, everything that God's people have
[1:44:16] gone through
[1:44:18] is the devil taking on the form riding
[1:44:21] against their family or riding on their
[1:44:24] family, riding on their tribe, riding on
[1:44:26] the enemy to come against them.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And in the same way also, it was God
[1:44:34] that wake up a young man like Shem guy.
[1:44:37] He was not even trained. He got so fed
[1:44:40] up. The spirit of the Lord came upon
[1:44:42] him. He said, "Over my dead body, I'm
[1:44:45] I'm done. These guys got to kill me
[1:44:47] before they will ever get to my
[1:44:48] children." Amen. It was the spirit of
[1:44:50] God that came on him.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Gideon was so afraid. I mean, he the
[1:44:56] Bible say he was so afraid. I mean, he
[1:44:58] was so scared and and and and then an an
[1:45:02] angel met him and scared him to death.
[1:45:05] The angel said, "Oh mighty man of
[1:45:08] villain." He thought the angel was
[1:45:10] talking to somebody else, me.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because in him, he knew
[1:45:16] his person of struggle. In him, he knew
[1:45:19] his person of fear. Praise the Lord. But
[1:45:22] but honor that person of struggle and
[1:45:25] fear. God knows what he have put in
[1:45:28] Gideon for the day that Gideon was in to
[1:45:31] be able to to stand for God's word in
[1:45:34] that day.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Gideon is is is is
[1:45:42] tempting the angel. Okay, let let the de
[1:45:45] fall. Okay, let that no be due. And all
[1:45:47] of these things as he's doing that, God
[1:45:50] is also using that to build courage in
[1:45:53] him.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:57] Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; The beast and the rider.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Job trial came in in uh in in four.
[1:46:17] So we can say that Job experienced the
[1:46:19] Palmer womb. He experienced the canker
[1:46:21] womb. He experienced the caterpillar. He
[1:46:23] experienced the locust. We can say that
[1:46:25] Job had the first horse rather. He had a
[1:46:29] second horse rather. He had a tear horse
[1:46:31] rather.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; We had You see, so in the book of
[1:46:34] Revelation, it comes out with this
[1:46:36] description, but it does not change what
[1:46:39] it was in the beginning.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] I will even carry you. I will carry you
[1:46:54] a little bit
[1:46:56] here also and show you
[1:47:00] in our father Abraham.
[1:47:04] He was uh
[1:47:07] God's chosen man of that day. But he was
[1:47:11] born in sin. But he came from parents
[1:47:14] that were worshiping idols in Babylon.
[1:47:18] But so Abraham
[1:47:21] in his heart he had a call from God.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; He had a call he did not fully
[1:47:28] understood but he was following it in
[1:47:30] fact
[1:47:32] but yet his physical body is struggling
[1:47:35] because we see in the word yet that he
[1:47:38] had a lying a lying habit.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; He had a lying habit that was battering
[1:47:47] him. tell his wife, you know, tell tell
[1:47:49] uh uh uh the the king that you my
[1:47:51] sister.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you also now how those
[1:47:58] spirit right in the generation that seen
[1:48:00] lying have a god on Isaac.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; It rode on him when it got on Jacob, it
[1:48:07] was worse
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; because he became a deceiver.
[1:48:12] The sin lie have a god on Joseph
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; and it broke his record
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; of being a perfect type of Jesus.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; He could have been completely like Jesus
[1:48:26] but because he told a lie.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see what I'm bringing out
[1:48:38] in this is that uh uh uh you have to
[1:48:41] remember Christ is revealing his own
[1:48:44] word. Brother Brandham says the devil
[1:48:46] has an error in your life he has the
[1:48:48] right to punish.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; And until that place is covered he will
[1:48:54] punch it.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when and and and when that
[1:49:00] punch is there or when that habit is
[1:49:02] there and a person do not identify it to
[1:49:05] take it to Calvary, that beast will ride
[1:49:08] on you and go to your next generation.
[1:49:10] It will ride on it and go to the next
[1:49:12] generation.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Just talking about the beast and the
[1:49:21] rather look at David. Let me give you a
[1:49:24] an example here with David. David here
[1:49:26] was uh you know he was trapped in this
[1:49:28] adultery.
[1:49:30] He lost led him to adultery.
[1:49:33] To really cover it up he killed a man.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; He had a blood on his hands.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; That's how deadly sin is.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it has to produce death before
[1:49:47] people come to themsel and realize that
[1:49:49] this thing is killing it.
[1:49:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Think about it this way. What if David
[1:50:05] did this and he ran straight to Nathan
[1:50:08] and said, "Natan, oh my God, Nathan, see
[1:50:11] what I've got myself in with all that
[1:50:13] God has blessed me with. See what I got
[1:50:16] myself in." Praise the Lord. He might
[1:50:19] have redeemed himself.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; He might have redeemed himself, but no,
[1:50:26] he never h went to Nathan.
[1:50:30] He was covering the scene. Send Urias to
[1:50:34] the front of the battle.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want anybody to see me now.
[1:50:38] I'm I'm resting. He was doing everything
[1:50:40] to cover the wrong that he was doing.
[1:50:43] And as he cover it, that thing was
[1:50:45] breathing within.
[1:50:48] Amen.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; It was breeding within
[1:50:52] and you see what will happen there.
[1:50:54] Nathan, God had to re reveal David
[1:50:58] weakness to Nathan and and and and and
[1:51:01] Nathan came to meet David and David they
[1:51:05] full of guilt. The man that have done
[1:51:07] this the man must die.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Why should it reach to death
[1:51:11] before we want to make our life right?
[1:51:15] Why should we wait for dying bed when we
[1:51:18] have all the time to get ourself ready?
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now we're just talking
[1:51:26] about the beast and the rather but you
[1:51:28] see that spirit rode on David.
[1:51:32] If he will have run to Nathan, maybe he
[1:51:34] will have got God's mercy. Maybe even
[1:51:38] though when Nathan came he says the man
[1:51:40] must die, God still gave him grace
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; and said no the David you will not die.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; But the sword will not leave your house.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; The thing you did in secret will be done
[1:51:56] publicly.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; So what happened? We read that in the in
[1:52:02] the in the in the Bible. The Bible talks
[1:52:04] about Anna, David's son. He took Tema,
[1:52:08] his own sister, and ripped her.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; It was the progression of that evil,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; that spirit of lust
[1:52:22] that took David into adultery and and
[1:52:24] and and and and murder
[1:52:28] is now making him to do this. And what
[1:52:31] happened? Terma was a sister to Abselon.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Abselon got enraged of that
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; and what he did he killed his own
[1:52:42] brother and they did not stop him there.
[1:52:45] He decided I would take over the throne.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; When it start riding, it can start
[1:52:55] riding very innocent.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; In the first age, it was a white house.
[1:53:00] Everybody thought it was it was Christ.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Until the prophet came on the scene and
[1:53:05] told us he has a bow, he does not have
[1:53:08] an arrow.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; That would not be Christ.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; It sounded very innocent. And I said is
[1:53:18] costing the life of his children, is
[1:53:20] causing the life of his house, of his
[1:53:22] kingdom, of his church.
[1:53:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:37] Abselum killed his brother Anna and uh
[1:53:42] he decided to take over the kingdom
[1:53:45] and he was not satisfied.
[1:53:48] He took his father's concuban on top of
[1:53:50] the roof of the house.
[1:53:53] He abused every one of them.
[1:53:56] What was done in secret came to an open.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Bible says if we confess our sin, God
[1:54:06] will forgive us.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; If we cover it, we will not prosper.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; There is nothing you can do
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; to get away from it
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; because it's a beast that is riding
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; and it's intention. His final end is
[1:54:24] death.
[1:54:25] That's what that was what the pill house
[1:54:27] was called death.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; All that when you talk we talk about
[1:54:37] Absel so sorryful
[1:54:39] but even the one h Solomon
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; that was visited by God in dream
[1:54:48] because David never sought sought mercy.
[1:54:52] He didn't run to God quickly. Now
[1:54:55] Solomon end up now to be this guy
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; trying to protect the kingdom.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; He end up in the worst of all until many
[1:55:05] wives took his heart away from the Lord.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe he thought that well I mean I'm
[1:55:13] not I'm not committing adultery. I'm
[1:55:15] marrying them. But as they are coming
[1:55:17] they bringing their idols.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] as they coming, they breaking their
[1:55:29] idols.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense to you?
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Are we Are we Are we getting somewhere
[1:55:36] with this?
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Because I mean, I can go right into the
[1:55:39] church ages and use the church age book
[1:55:41] and tell you about the writers and never
[1:55:42] bring it home. I can leave it in history
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; and never bring it home. What I'm trying
[1:55:48] to do is to show you that that rather
[1:55:51] that road in history. He's writing this
[1:55:54] morning.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; He's writing this morning. I believe he
[1:55:59] wrote you here h waking up this morning
[1:56:03] with a consciousness to worship the
[1:56:05] Lord. He wrote you in the presence of
[1:56:07] the Lord.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:14] But don't stop with good shepherd.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Go beyond good shepherd.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Go into his presence.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Because there is an open door.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Go into his presence.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Go into a further revelation of Jesus
[1:56:31] Christ,
[1:56:34] the beast and the rather.
[1:56:37] I read something to you. Uh uh uh
[1:56:41] someone sent me uh no they didn't send
[1:56:44] it to me. I think I was looking at all
[1:56:46] of these uh uh quotes online and I just
[1:56:50] listening to it came up on my phone and
[1:56:52] it blessed my heart and I decided okay
[1:56:54] I'm going to I'm going to meditate on
[1:56:55] this. I will also take this and add it
[1:56:57] to my notes. So I read it to you before
[1:56:58] we close this morning.
[1:57:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; See what brother Brandon said here in
[1:57:11] testing for life. See what he says here.
[1:57:17] He says if God's spirit is in you and uh
[1:57:22] you see God word fulfilled,
[1:57:26] it will make you rejoice.
[1:57:30] Something has to move.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Something has to move. Something has to
[1:57:38] move. Something has to move you.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. See, see the way he connect this.
[1:57:43] Now when Jesus
[1:57:47] came into the city, he said if they will
[1:57:50] hold their peace, the rock will
[1:57:53] immediately cry out. Something has to
[1:57:56] move when the spirit of God comes riding
[1:58:01] in.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Something has to move. Why?
[1:58:08] Because you are just a vehicle.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; When you receive the word, then it moves
[1:58:14] you.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; It moves you in the path of the word.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:23] When the spirit of God comes riding in,
[1:58:26] something has to move. So the prophet of
[1:58:28] God saying here when we see God's word
[1:58:31] being fulfilled when we see God's word
[1:58:34] identifying the promise to us it
[1:58:37] rejoice. Is that not why Jesus told the
[1:58:39] disciples don't rejoice in all of this
[1:58:41] healing? Rejoice because your name is in
[1:58:43] the
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Oh God give us a church that rejoice in
[1:58:50] the promises. Give us a church that
[1:58:52] rejoice in the word.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Not the people that are entertained by
[1:58:56] the word and people that rejoice in the
[1:58:58] word.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; When you rejoice in the word, you know
[1:59:01] how to say amen. You say, "Thank you,
[1:59:03] Jesus." You say, "Lord, that's a promise
[1:59:05] for me."
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; You are rejoicing in the word.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting there to be
[1:59:11] entertained.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; He says something has to move. When the
[1:59:17] spirit of God comes riding in,
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; something has to move.
[1:59:22] Something has to move.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; A willing vessel has to move. A body
[1:59:27] that is surrendered has to move. A one
[1:59:29] that is waiting on God has to move.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; A heart that is saying, "Lord, here I
[1:59:34] am," has to move.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; A heart that is saying, "Do something in
[1:59:38] me."
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Has to move.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:59:50] You love the Lord.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:59:54] Let's praise him together. Thank you,
[1:59:56] Jesus.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Blessed be your name.
[2:00:00] Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. We
[2:00:04] love you. We appreciate you. Yes. Yes.
[2:00:08] Something has to move and the spirit of
[2:00:10] God comes in.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; We can stay. We can still We can stay
[2:00:14] like that.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. A drive that drive a rock of
[2:00:19] Aaron. It a it a it bouncy in the
[2:00:21] presence of God. It putful leaves.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; How much more about us with blood and
[2:00:27] sinners in our body and the Lord of
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; you can stay
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; and in the presence of God like that
[2:00:34] when the spirit of God comes in
[2:00:36] something has to move.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God comes in and and and
[2:00:44] it moves upon a person and they stand
[2:00:45] and still and shout. Everybody look at
[2:00:47] him. Oh wow.
[2:00:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; It's either your own or vehicle is so
[2:00:55] loaded
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; that it can't move at the word of God.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; So when someone is rejoicing in the
[2:01:02] word, it looks like they're making
[2:01:03] noise.
[2:01:15] So, like I said, I I I was listening
[2:01:18] there and and and
[2:01:21] uh I decided I said, "Well, this is a
[2:01:23] good code. I will just keep it." I said,
[2:01:25] "I will keep it. I'm just looking for a
[2:01:27] good time to use it. I thought I would
[2:01:29] use it on a prayer meeting, but while I
[2:01:31] was sitting in the office there and just
[2:01:32] putting my notes together before I sent
[2:01:35] it, I came I I look in there, I saw it
[2:01:37] again. I said, "Well, okay. I just throw
[2:01:39] this one in. If uh if we have time to
[2:01:42] read it, then we will read it. So, we
[2:01:44] read that and then we bring our our
[2:01:46] subject to a close this morning and uh
[2:01:50] trust to see how the Lord will help us.
[2:01:53] Amen.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandon. Now, this is
[2:01:57] from the message influence. So, you will
[2:01:59] hear a lot of use here in Isaiah. He
[2:02:01] says here, see, you must be able to
[2:02:04] stand and take correction.
[2:02:07] Some of them won't do it. I have went to
[2:02:11] meeting and I have sat down in an
[2:02:13] auditorium
[2:02:15] and uh and you get up and some people
[2:02:18] come in and they sit down just for a few
[2:02:20] minute. If you say one word that they
[2:02:23] don't agree with brother Brandon snap
[2:02:25] his finger gone see flying up. Well that
[2:02:29] you know what happened to to to Hezekiah
[2:02:32] or Yuzia rather God smought him with
[2:02:35] leprosy. The man died in his leprosy
[2:02:39] which is a type of sin. He couldn't
[2:02:41] stand
[2:02:43] to be corrected by the word.
[2:02:46] And many times today uh uh it is the
[2:02:50] same thing. They say well my
[2:02:53] denomination believe this I don't care.
[2:02:56] See take time and search the word. God
[2:02:59] God will never judge the word by a
[2:03:02] denomination. He will judge it by his
[2:03:04] word. Amen.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; And his word is Christ. And Christ is
[2:03:08] his word. He is the same yesterday,
[2:03:10] today and forever. Hebrew 13:8.
[2:03:13] Instead of trying to take correction,
[2:03:16] they fly loose. They can't stand it.
[2:03:19] Amen.
[2:03:21] I really I really want wanted to use
[2:03:23] this uh uh uh next week for my talk to
[2:03:26] be able to bring to you because uh uh uh
[2:03:29] it's going to be like like a like a
[2:03:32] correction, but also it's just going to
[2:03:34] be uh uh me just spilling out my heart
[2:03:37] to you a little bit so you can know
[2:03:39] where this guy that is standing before
[2:03:40] you, you can know where he is. Amen.
[2:03:45] But we have the opportunity to read it
[2:03:47] here now. That's exactly what Yuzia
[2:03:50] done. A good man, you said, "Well, that
[2:03:53] person, Yuzia was a good person, too. A
[2:03:56] fine person, a God blessed man. But no
[2:03:58] matter what it was, he must always stay
[2:04:01] in his place because God gave him the
[2:04:04] opportunity to influence other by being
[2:04:07] a righteous king." uh but a priest,
[2:04:11] not a priest. Sorry, not a priest. And
[2:04:15] uh and the word forbid him to do that.
[2:04:18] So he went in and was and was going to
[2:04:21] offer
[2:04:23] and and and when you see that's that's
[2:04:25] sometimes that's when the projection is
[2:04:28] good because I could be reading
[2:04:29] something completely different and uh uh
[2:04:32] and and not making sense to you, but at
[2:04:34] least you are following. Amen. So that's
[2:04:37] good. I appreciate that. The word forbid
[2:04:39] him to do that. So, and uh and when he
[2:04:44] was called, the word was given to him
[2:04:48] that he wasn't supposed to do that
[2:04:51] thing. Musicians, you can come, you can
[2:04:53] come closely.
[2:04:57] That God has blessed him in his business
[2:05:00] in whatever he was, but not to try to
[2:05:03] take this priest office. He He was out
[2:05:06] of the word. He was he was going to do
[2:05:09] it anyhow no matter what anyone says.
[2:05:15] Now isn't there the attitude of too many
[2:05:18] people today? They won't take correction
[2:05:20] of the word and that is the reason we
[2:05:23] find ourself wrapped up wrapped up in a
[2:05:27] big council of churches here not knowing
[2:05:31] where we are going heading into the
[2:05:34] word. Now when I read this you you
[2:05:37] remember now I'm reading this I'm
[2:05:38] applying it to our local assembly. Amen.
[2:05:41] I'm applying it to myself and I'm
[2:05:44] reading this and brother Brandon says we
[2:05:46] will not take correction. He says and
[2:05:48] that is the reason why we find ourself
[2:05:50] wrapped up in a council. Now you might
[2:05:52] not be in a council of churches but in
[2:05:55] another sense if you take this thought
[2:05:58] you can see that if we are not following
[2:06:00] the correction of God's word it's easy
[2:06:03] for us to get wrapped up in something
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; wrapped up in a religious spirit.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Or you might say well I don't believe
[2:06:12] the council of churches is of the devil.
[2:06:14] The council of churches is mark of the
[2:06:15] beast. You know I believe brother
[2:06:17] Brandma as a prophet. I believe the
[2:06:18] message of the hour. you know uh uh but
[2:06:21] I want you to be able to see this.
[2:06:25] The word must be able to speak to you
[2:06:27] even when you are reading it on your
[2:06:30] bed. I will tell you something. I was I
[2:06:32] I was just sharing that uh uh uh with
[2:06:34] the brothers the other day uh uh uh uh
[2:06:38] sitting there with some brothers and I
[2:06:40] was I was reading just this few days. I
[2:06:42] was lying on my bed and I was thinking
[2:06:44] about preaching the message on
[2:06:46] discouragement.
[2:06:48] I was just lying there, Lord. I said,
[2:06:50] "Father, you know how I'm feeling in my
[2:06:52] heart, you know, I'm and I'm lying
[2:06:54] there." So I said, "Well, okay, let me
[2:06:56] just take some quotes of brother
[2:06:58] Brandham on discouragement." So I put in
[2:07:00] discouragement. The first quote I read,
[2:07:03] Brother Brandham says, "With all that
[2:07:05] God has done for us through this age
[2:07:08] that we will still be discouraged." I
[2:07:10] said, "Oh God, you know where my heart
[2:07:12] is. You can't meet me right on this bed.
[2:07:19] I'm looking for co to come and fire
[2:07:21] these people up. The Lord said, "Well,
[2:07:22] you need it. I'm going to give it to you
[2:07:25] without much that I've done for you."
[2:07:27] And you would mind people adding to you
[2:07:29] and be discouraged. God forbid.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; God forbid.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; God forbid.
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:39] I rather die with my boots on.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; I rather die with my boots on.
[2:07:46] He met me as a young man,
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; a young preacher.
[2:07:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:55] I rather die with my boots on. Let me
[2:07:57] not go in that direction.
[2:08:06] Isn't that the attitude of many people?
[2:08:09] They won't take correction of the word.
[2:08:11] And that is the reason we find ourselves
[2:08:13] wrapped up in a big council of churches
[2:08:15] here not knowing where to go heading
[2:08:18] into the word. Tens of thousands of
[2:08:20] members added every year. They don't see
[2:08:25] the hand of God anywhere moving.
[2:08:28] [Music]
[2:08:30] So, you know, just thinking about all of
[2:08:32] them, you know, as I'm meditating and
[2:08:35] studying, I'm telling myself, I says,
[2:08:36] "Lord, uh, you know, sometimes
[2:08:40] It looks like we we we crave for a
[2:08:44] growing church.
[2:08:48] But I think we must crave to grow in the
[2:08:50] word, to grow in his presence,
[2:08:54] to be able to walk in the church and
[2:08:56] feel the presence of God, which of
[2:08:59] course God have dealt with us time and
[2:09:01] time again.
[2:09:03] But I think something is going wrong.
[2:09:06] I don't know what it is.
[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:18] Tens of thousands of member out there
[2:09:19] every year and we don't even see the
[2:09:21] hand of God anywhere moving dead former
[2:09:24] just exactly what the Bible says they
[2:09:26] will be laudes church is a lukewarm
[2:09:29] spilled from the mouth of God Christ is
[2:09:31] outside trying to get in the church
[2:09:35] inside won't let him in
[2:09:39] set the picture of today. Exactly.
[2:09:42] Because men doesn't understand
[2:09:46] that their position comes from the word,
[2:09:49] the word of God.
[2:09:53] We are only in position when we are
[2:09:55] standing with the word.
[2:09:57] You can be standing for whatever you are
[2:09:59] standing for. If you're not standing for
[2:10:01] the word, you are out of place. You are
[2:10:03] upside down.
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:10] And thought he was taken that he now
[2:10:14] remember we call him today a Christian
[2:10:17] that God has blessed. He wasn't just the
[2:10:20] same ordinary man. He was a man that was
[2:10:23] blessed by God. But he did not want to
[2:10:27] stand correction no matter how much the
[2:10:30] word says it was. So he didn't want to
[2:10:34] understand that because he felt secure
[2:10:37] enough that God will let him get by with
[2:10:41] something else.
[2:10:44] A little place of complacency.
[2:10:48] A little place of a sense of enough
[2:10:51] because there's no way we can compare
[2:10:53] our past with where we are now.
[2:11:12] And that's what the matter with our
[2:11:14] people today around the world that they
[2:11:16] think that God will let them get by with
[2:11:19] something contrary to his word. He will
[2:11:21] never do it. We must come back to
[2:11:24] correction instinct correction by the
[2:11:26] word. And because of his arrogant way he
[2:11:30] acted, he pay no attention to what what
[2:11:35] this minister had to say, he would do
[2:11:38] what he wanted to do. Just think now
[2:11:40] just stop that. Just stop that in your
[2:11:43] mind a minute and see what brother
[2:11:46] Brandon says here. How can a child face
[2:11:49] his father and mother that's godly? How
[2:11:52] could a teenager look in the face of
[2:11:55] their golly mother with her hair turning
[2:11:58] gray and say to this teenager, "Honey,
[2:12:02] mother has raised you different." You
[2:12:05] see, and you see back down through the
[2:12:08] life was was done for mother. Don't do
[2:12:13] that and turn arrogant and say, "Take
[2:12:17] your religion and go. I will do whatever
[2:12:20] I want. May that spirit never come on
[2:12:23] our children.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because brother Brandham said,
[2:12:30] "God will never allow you to walk on the
[2:12:32] righteous prayers of your parents."
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; I never went searching for this. I
[2:12:42] didn't go searching for it to make it
[2:12:45] part of my notes. all these YouTube
[2:12:47] things that can come on YouTube. It just
[2:12:50] came on my phone with with brother
[2:12:52] Brandon voice and I was just listening
[2:12:54] to it uh at work meditating on.
[2:12:58] So I didn't go search for it. So don't
[2:13:00] tell me it's because of you. I just felt
[2:13:03] like I could use this on the prayer
[2:13:05] meeting, use this for the service. And
[2:13:08] if you if you think that it's because of
[2:13:10] you, then it's because of you.
[2:13:14] [Music]
[2:13:16] Brother Bam says how can a child in the
[2:13:18] face of a father or a mother
[2:13:21] or you see it is the spirit those
[2:13:24] spirits are all in the schools of the
[2:13:25] children
[2:13:27] they go there they see the they they see
[2:13:29] the arrogant mix that is there they see
[2:13:32] the way that other children behave even
[2:13:36] though they would not behave but if a
[2:13:38] child is insulting and becoming arrogant
[2:13:40] to a teacher is a spirit that could just
[2:13:43] bread.
[2:13:45] Especially when the children sit down
[2:13:46] and they enjoy it,
[2:13:52] you have taken that spirit. And then
[2:13:54] pretty soon you can come home and start
[2:13:56] to do the same thing to your mother.
[2:13:59] Do the same thing to your dad.
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:09] Don't do that. and you turn arrogant and
[2:14:12] say take your religion gone I will do
[2:14:15] what what I want what an outcome of that
[2:14:20] teenager what happened to them is gone
[2:14:24] they are lost spiritually morally
[2:14:27] many times physically and mentally
[2:14:30] that's what is happening to our
[2:14:31] generation
[2:14:35] when young people feel that uh they are
[2:14:38] suppressed by the message of the power
[2:14:42] they can't enjoy. There is no fun. They
[2:14:44] are not enjoying everything.
[2:14:46] You see, we we have we have a
[2:14:48] responsibility to make this word come
[2:14:51] alive to to the young people. Do
[2:14:54] something.
[2:14:56] [Music]
[2:15:02] We talk at the young few that went out
[2:15:04] for the camp. I mean, they blew their
[2:15:06] mind. They enjoy. They want to go back
[2:15:08] again.
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:15] Some of us all we do we just work and
[2:15:18] work and work and work and work.
[2:15:20] Sometime change your environment. Look
[2:15:22] for the convention to go take your
[2:15:24] children out. Let them let them be
[2:15:25] exposed to this big message community.
[2:15:32] They will make friends.
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:39] They will see other young people that
[2:15:40] dealing with the same thing that they
[2:15:41] are dealing with.
[2:15:47] [Music]
[2:15:52] But say just that one behavior, just
[2:15:55] that one misbehavior, one arrogant
[2:15:58] behavior, that child could be lost
[2:16:00] spiritually, mentally,
[2:16:03] physically.
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:06] Sometimes it's easy.
[2:16:11] [Music]

[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[2:19:16] There's a lot of things that we talk
[2:19:17] about this morning,
[2:19:20] dealing with spirits, rebuking spirits.
[2:19:22] I want us to just pray together this
[2:19:24] morning. And uh uh
[2:19:28] if there's a place that the word
[2:19:30] convicts you, put it under the blood. If
[2:19:33] there's a place, if you don't feel
[2:19:35] nothing, then pray for somebody. Pray
[2:19:37] for a young person, pray for your
[2:19:39] children, pray for your wife, pray for
[2:19:41] your husband.
[2:19:44] We want to be standing with the word.
[2:19:46] May God just be merciful.
[2:19:50] I want to say, Lord, I'm the one
[2:19:51] standing in the need of prayer. I'm the
[2:19:53] one needing you this morning.
[2:19:56] Oh God,
[2:19:59] Father.
[2:20:01] You are the King of glory. You are the
[2:20:04] God Almighty.
[2:20:07] Lord, we see that we are in the evil
[2:20:08] days. We see the evil days upon us,
[2:20:10] Lord. We see oh God all the things that
[2:20:13] are happening around us Lord Jesus.
[2:20:16] Father we even see our own weaknesses
[2:20:19] and laziness oh God. Father we see our
[2:20:22] own backsliding. Oh God father Lord I
[2:20:25] pray oh God father Lord that there is
[2:20:27] under the sound of my voice that don't
[2:20:30] see their own backsliding that don't see
[2:20:32] where they need you Lord. Oh God, we all
[2:20:35] are coming just like Isaiah this morning
[2:20:38] and saying, "Oh God, who is me? Father,
[2:20:41] Lord, oh precious Lord Jesus, for God
[2:20:45] I'm undone." He said, "I'm a man of
[2:20:47] unclean lips." Maybe there is some of
[2:20:50] unclean thoughts, unclean desire,
[2:20:52] unclean habits. Lord, oh father, unclean
[2:20:56] words, almighty God, I pray, Lord Jesus.
[2:21:00] Oh father, Lord God. Oh let let the Holy
[2:21:03] Ghost Lord Jesus let the blessed Holy
[2:21:06] Spirit Lord God. Father Lord that have
[2:21:10] rolled upon all the saints throughout
[2:21:12] the ages Lord. The Holy Ghost that rode
[2:21:14] upon the believers. Oh Father God. Oh
[2:21:17] may that Holy Ghost ride upon the bride
[2:21:20] this morning Lord. Oh Father God Lord
[2:21:23] Jesus we identify our rather Lord. We
[2:21:26] can identify our rather Lord God. He's
[2:21:29] truth. He's faithful. Lord God, Father,
[2:21:32] we can identify our rider, Lord. He's
[2:21:34] the alpha and the omega, Lord. We can
[2:21:37] identify our rider. His name is Jesus
[2:21:40] Christ. He is the word of God. He's the
[2:21:43] spirit of the living God. He is the
[2:21:45] bride rider. That's the one that is
[2:21:47] riding on the bride. He's the one riding
[2:21:50] on the truth church. We can identify our
[2:21:53] rather is not a religious spirit. Our
[2:21:55] rather, Father God, Lord, is not even
[2:21:57] brother Brandon. No God, father, Lord, I
[2:22:00] would rather is the Holy Ghost. I would
[2:22:02] rather is Jesus Christ because this is
[2:22:05] Christ in bride form. That's what the
[2:22:07] bride is. That's the rapturing material.
[2:22:10] Oh father, we pray. Oh God, Lord, yes
[2:22:13] Lord Jesus,
[2:22:15] I pray, oh father, Lord God, may the
[2:22:18] Holy Ghost this morning, Lord God, the
[2:22:20] rally of the church, may he take his
[2:22:23] place, oh father, Lord, may he ride us
[2:22:25] back in the presence of God. May he ride
[2:22:28] us back to the place of prayer, to the
[2:22:30] place of consecration. Lord, let's get
[2:22:32] away from all of these nasty and and and
[2:22:35] filthy things, oh God, that we're
[2:22:37] feeding our minds with, feeding our
[2:22:39] spirit with, oh God. Father, it's just
[2:22:41] creating death in us. Oh Lord, creating
[2:22:44] death in us, oh Father, I pray in the
[2:22:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, may the
[2:22:49] Holy Ghost take his place this morning.
[2:22:51] That is the rider of the church. That is
[2:22:53] the rider of the bride. That is the one
[2:22:55] that will ride this old bride into the
[2:22:58] rapture. She will ride her into
[2:23:00] manifestation. She will ride her into
[2:23:02] her position. Oh God, Father, we thank
[2:23:05] you Lord. I thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[2:23:08] Father, I pray for every every head
[2:23:10] under the sound of my voice, Lord, and
[2:23:13] say, "Almighty God, oh precious Lord,
[2:23:15] dealing with spirits this morning,
[2:23:17] Father God, I knew, Lord God. Father,
[2:23:20] Lord, oh God, the other night, Lord,
[2:23:22] when the enemy just came, oh God,
[2:23:24] Father, just just a strong attack, Lord,
[2:23:26] I know he's trying. Oh, Father, God,
[2:23:28] Lord, oh, but I know that, Father, he's
[2:23:31] a defeated beast. Oh, God. Father, Lord,
[2:23:34] we just thank you, Lord. We praise you.
[2:23:37] We worship you father God. We worship
[2:23:39] you. That is our place Lord. Our
[2:23:42] influence comes from the throne. Our
[2:23:44] influence comes from the word. Oh
[2:23:46] father. Blessed be your name Jesus.
[2:23:49] Blessed be your name Lord.
[2:23:53] [Music]
[2:23:59] Thank you father. Oh yes Lord.
[2:24:03] Yes Lord Jesus.
[2:24:06] Yes, Lord. Father, come Lord.
[2:24:10] Ride upon us, Lord God.
[2:24:15] What an awesome God you are.
[2:24:18] What a wonderful father you are, Jesus.
[2:24:24] Lord, we just want to use this time, oh
[2:24:26] God, and bring all our weaknesses before
[2:24:29] you. Forgive us, Lord God, of all of our
[2:24:32] iniquities, Lord Jesus. Oh God, father.
[2:24:35] Lord, if we are not listening to that
[2:24:38] small stave voice, Lord, if we are not
[2:24:40] listening to your instruction, Lord,
[2:24:42] God, Father, oh just have mercy, Lord
[2:24:45] God, Father, Lord. Yes, Lord Jesus. We
[2:24:48] pray, oh God. Yes, oh Father. Lord,
[2:24:52] come and ride on me, Lord God. Come and
[2:24:55] ride on me into your presence, Lord.
[2:24:58] Come, oh Father, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:01] Oh, blessed be your holy name.
[2:25:06] Blessed be your holy name.
[2:25:10] Blessed be your holy name.
[2:25:13] [Music]
[2:25:15] Please Lord Jesus.
[2:25:18] Please Lord Father, we are failing. Oh
[2:25:21] God, in our prayer life, oh God, we are
[2:25:24] compromising on the word. Lord Jesus, oh
[2:25:28] precious Lord, what where is our state
[2:25:31] of righteousness? Lord, where where is
[2:25:34] our stand for what is truth? Lord, keep
[2:25:36] me father God, Lord, if it's oh God,
[2:25:38] precious Lord Jesus, against my best
[2:25:41] judgment, if it is the word, let my soul
[2:25:43] say, "Amen." Oh God, father please. Lord
[2:25:47] Jesus, please. Oh father, Lord,
[2:25:51] please. Almighty God,
[2:25:54] please Lord, how long, oh God, Father,
[2:25:58] will we stay in this condition, Lord
[2:26:00] God, Father, how long will we stay to
[2:26:02] the place of doubt, oh God, the place of
[2:26:05] fear, Lord Jesus? How long will we stay
[2:26:08] to this place, oh God? When with our
[2:26:10] spirit get free Lord God. When with Lord
[2:26:13] God, Father, oh Jesus, we have been able
[2:26:17] to enter you God.
