Pentecost from the Wesley got all the Methodists got all gummed up the Baptist and presbyterian he sent the Pentecostal message to separate light from darkness the Pentecost went right back out into

out here these different glares organizations may they see like Nicodemus even if they have to come tonight come to the light brannad father yes may they are come forth this great issue of the shrub that's cut out of the mountain without hands it'll crush the Gentile kingdoms to the ground all these kingdoms spiritual kingdoms and natural kingdoms and the rock will cover the whole earth have you purified a pair those who that rock crush will be ground into powder those who fall upon that rock shall have a solid foundation oh Christ let be as your sermon died upon this rock this rock of that word our Lord God let me stand as David and them wires of all who stood far David let me stand for this word today was it's rejected by the denominations it's laying up here to literally retreat

granite Lord or we're looking to you the great one with the switch in the hand you hold the world in your hand you hold all things in your hand and uphold the world by your word Oh father let us receive the word would you please Lord let that be the testimony in the desire of every heart in here father's we sang these hymns that David's son the hymns they become prophecy they were prophecy and you recognize them props as we sing it Lord let it be in our hearts - as we sing we'll walk in this life let be Lord this is a beautiful life it's a word its Christ living among us not what he was what he is and we know what he was only reflected what he is and we pray father that the people will understand and walk in this beautiful life we asked in Jesus name while we remain standing just a moment I lost all saying now in here there's Presbyterian methodist catholic this is a mixed up audience when it comes to denominational now remember that it be knowing I'm speaking enough to the gifts of people in these glares but I'll prove it to the Bible that they are glares amen if it was that Christ would be doing like he promised to do with them see but they refuse that see and when you get there what do you find a jarn the church recite a Creed and what does it go not come to the end of the road you find out is a false mirage Christ is the work is a lot live now hard you can live do you live for something what do you live it far so he can die every one of you what are you working for he eat why are you eating for to live what are you living part to die so why not live to live why not live to live then the only way you can live is accept the word cause man should not live by bread alone what we make out your the sweater around but by every word that comes from the mouth of God now the word of the mouth of God has been vindicated right here before by the holy spirit live by watching now I won't while we sing this again that's just each one you stand in our place reach or and

safe you can say it as loud as you want at all here right here Amen Alleluia yes you and all I was found Naomi's gonna have a special here in just a moment and I was at work here earlier this week and of course I always go to exercise over in cardiac rehab you have all the exercise equipment and I can go over there they've got the big-screen TVs there so I was like to get on and watch the news while I'm working out and there's been a couple of times this past week where I heard the the fellow on the broadcast say that 80% of the people are going to get this corona virus and you know what Saints that is a lie the devil if we could see into that other dimension what we do is we'd see that spirit standing behind the microphone saying guess what folks I'm going to plague 80% of you well I say when Satan comes in like a flood the scripture says God always raises a standard against it so Saints we don't have to accept that bag of rattlesnakes that they're actually broadcasting I just want to encourage each and every one of you to draw your swords stand on his promises praying for our people I know in this end time that we're going to have situations where we know even the scripture talks about different things happening but you know what he always will listen to a an earnest prayer from his children so we can stand against the enemy we don't have to accept that and so I just I just been praying I said Lord just put a hedge about the state of Minnesota I says that they could see that you're still the same yesterday today and forever and amen we don't have to believe that lie that Satan is broadcasting over the television in a radio station so oh my are you with me saints of God nice morning a man let's just agree in prayer to that so I think we ought to sing a song I think we sang last Sunday in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus think about these words now before we sing it we have we have not will have we have it now the victory because Christ is our victory Satan is a defeated enemy in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus what does that say up there demons have to flee demons have to flee so when we come in the name of Jesus Jamie Said's who can stand before in the precious name of Jesus we have the victory so let's sing it with all of our hearts in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we have the big door recall now in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus all demons they have to flee now when we come in the name of Jesus tell me who can stand before in the precious name of Jesus we have the victory well in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we have the great story in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus demons have 2/3 where we come in the name of Jesus tell me who can stand before in the precious name of Jesus we have the Victoria and the people all said Amen Saints I just want you to all it does not make it feel good Oman makes me feel good we it says the scripture says that one will change the thousand and two ten thousand well I guess three would chase a hundred thousand and let's say four would be a million five more W ten million and on and on scenes of God so if you're all drawing your sorts today we'll just chase the enemy away because we are under our Lord's Authority amen and we can draw the sword and Satan's a defeated enemy and he's just a bluff hallelujah I don't want to sing that again and you know what all of you let's why don't you stand we can't shake each other's hands but you can shake one of those hands to your different family members so let's all stand give you just a moment

when we call in my Jesus tell me who they can be for in the precious name of Jesus we have a VIP door a man naomi has a special so if you want to get your microphone ready I you know what if I could see it to the dimension I think I saw Satan and his demons just see man we're out of here that's right get out of here because we've got plenty of angels of the Lord that want to have their chair and have their seats here and line up and down we don't have any room for Satan in the Hills so how do you Amen are you ready all right and the Omi's got a special this morning the little ship crashed amongst the ways [Music] and sailors cry to God and fear it seemed all hope was gone when to their terror-stricken hearts a strange sight did appear walking to them on the water it was Jesus [Music] not afraid the voice of authority Jesus knowing who he was change the course of history [Music] once again he speaks we have no need of fear Jesus lives within our hearts remember another time when all burnout from the business of the team helping people come to God kneeling along the way a violent storm rose up falling apart Jesus was asleep Cara's not that we perish Lord in their unbelief

have suggestions and things along that line something was too loud or too soft just let brother Jordan know cuz we're just trying to get this right and and we're doing and I think it's our goal is to be able to kind of get to a place where we can have special song from your house and having somebody pray from the house and they can broadcast that right over the system so if you just bear with us on that and make sure that it will just get better and better so by the time we are able to all gather back here we should have a down path so I thought I heard somebody clap back there so I must have

wish of course that's why we play this morning rather been an inspiration on this a man I can turn on the light and he was talking their story over there in in Mexico so that's why we played there and I mean a lot of things he said at the end of that message address where we are there's no need to be afraid as a man year that I can turn on the light amen let's just stand on about feeling turn to Psalm 91 Psalm 91 is has become a more popular song in such an hour [Music] everybody is reading it and ministers are preaching on it and I want to try this morning to be able to speak on it but I will speak just read the first verse and then I will have us to have our seat and then we will just trust the law this morning to be able to help us amen he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we just come to you this morning we approach in your word by faith O God we want to make this word by faith this morning I pray Lord Jesus or God me you just come out of the pages of your word father Lord Jesus and move to the Hutts and home of your children all God we just ask law of father that you will bless us now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Allah bless you you may have your seat and we will I never noticed it but writing mine in mind in my Bible that I'm reading from this little Bible I keep on the pulpit it it tied to some 91 the secret place of the Most High and that's mine that's that's what I have on mine not to speak on this morning the secret place of the Most High so I can be comfortable this morning amen and I was just talking about it yesterday and brother area was at the house trying to pick up some things and visit with us a little bit and in the fact that he was also reading on the same thing so you know when the Lord brings those things around like that it kind of show your heart that I mean the Holy Spirit is moving in the same direction and I've seen a lot of brothers also speaking on the same thing but this morning I want to look at the secret place of the Most High now this is the direction I want to go in as many as we all talk about this subject and we read about this now you think about it this way the minds of everybody is looking for a hiding place amen hiding under the shadow of the Almighty a place of refuge that we can run Toto high but the thing about the year is there David is talking about the secret place now your secret place but the secret place of the Most High so the one that is hiding in this hour is not you the one that is looking for a hiding place is the most high praise the Lord and what my inspiration is coming from is dead when the prophet of God came down to preach the seals he talks about a God that is held in simplicity praise the Lord the Old Testament from the beginning over in the book of Exodus in honor Moses it speaks about a City of Refuge and it speaks about a provider place that God has provided for his people to run to and hi but when we came over to the old testament I mean the New Testament we will realize even from the birth of Jesus Christ that right there it was God I was looking for a hiding place he was looking for a place to be born he was looking for a place to hide himself so on a shadow and in times through the Old Testament God sure how he had provided a place and it looks like a place for his people but in the New Testament a turn out to be he was the one or he is the one now that is looking for places to hide praise the Lord so we were taught about the secret place of the Most High not now your secret place but God's secret place I mean God is looking for the people and I can assure to you that God has got a people that's what I want to say this morning that God has got a people and and and some of the reason of all of these things that is happening us we'll look into the scripture is that God want to assure his bride God want to bring you to the place and said look I've got you I've got a place that I'm hiding myself you are that place praise the Lord he's bringing his bride talk to a place for her to be able to value all the words she be feeding on for her to value the Holy Ghost I've been leading her and guiding her Sophie Annette there's a man here that can turn on the light we have to realize that even that little girl the man I was that was there to turn on the light he was not somewhere as he was right in the darkness with her he was not in an engine room somewhere he was right in the elevator the engineer he was right in the situation with her you man I can turn on this slide the man I can turn this situation this ride is right in it with us he was not out of the fire furnace with Shadrach Meshach and Abednego he was right there he was not out of the lion den he was right in the lion's den with Daniel and he's right in this with us amen if you even look at it in in in the lion den the one that we could see was down here in the midst of the lion but there was one that was hiding it was Jehovah in the fire fundage you could see the three Hebrew boys thrown in the fire but there was one that was hiding so there is one that is hiding in this situation and that's the one we want to talk about this this this morning by the grace of God amen let's study a little bit second samuel chapter 24 let's go back and look at the background of this sam second samuel chapter 24 praise the Lord second samuel chapter 24 second samuel chapter 24 will bring us to this place of the plague that struck israel and this will set us it was set a good background for this Sam ninety-one after reading this you can read an entire chapter home and you go back and read some chapter 91 you would get the picture of why they we pray that prayer chapter 24 second Samuel is that what I said okay and again the anger of the Lord was candor against Israel and he moved David against him to say go number Israel and Judah first Chronicle 21 we just want to study a little bit in an established I taught here before we go forward nanny in second Samuel it's written there the anger of the Lord was kinda against Israel over in first chronicle and sit on stood up against Israel and provoked David to number the people Amen to normal Israel now you know through many account it looks like these are conflicting but there is there is something that is that it's major year is dead God was not happy with Israel I mean the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel but for God's judgment to come on the people it has to come from the failure or the weakness of he elected one he was not happy with the people but for him to bring a judgment on them he had to move David to a compromise on his word now if you if you follow you will realize that when the the pledge when the judgment will come it would not come on David it will come on the people praise the Lord and over in first chronicle as we will read a little bit and David said unto Joab and told the rulers of the people go number Israel from Beersheba on to them and bring the number of them to mean in that I mean know it wish of course Joe advised him that a Lord make his people and a hundred times so many more as they be but the Lord my lord King and then that all my lord seven why then do my lord require this thing why why will he be a cause of trespass in Israel praise the Lord now remember now the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel but yet David is the one that is going to trespass to bring God's judgment on the people nevertheless the King were prevailed against your work for Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem praise the Lord let's drop down a little bit there to verse 7 and God was displeased with this thing therefore he smart Israel and David said unto God I have seen a greatly because I have done this thing but now I beseech thee do a way the iniquity of the seven for I have done very foolishly and the Lord speak unto God David see you're saying go tell David saying thus saith the Lord are awful three of the three things choose the one of them that I may do it unto thee and gal came to David and said unto Him thus said the Lord choosing either three years farming or three months or to be destroy three months to be the strong before thy fall why the sward of thine enemy overtake thee or s3 dey's watch all the trees now three days the swore of the Lord even the pestilence in the lane and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the course of Israel now therefore advise themselves what word I should bring again to him that sent me and David said unto God I am in a great Street let me fall down into the hands of the law for very great his mercy but let me not fall into the hands of men so the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men praise the Lord amen now this will also help us to understand when brother Branham says and Sarah laughs right in the face of the angel that came to bring her the the news and Jehovah visiting her and he acts Abraham world's your wife Sarah and I mean she was right there in a tent and God knew where she word and he knew know everything that was happening but like the Prophet said God could not destroy he could not George Sarah he could not occur Sarah because he was just at a time of fulfilling his world now see this man David he's a man after God's own heart amen a man a king that God has raised up trained at the backside of the desert we know all the stories about it and all the trials that he have gone through even after suffering under the hand of Saul and then on his own failure with their Sheba and everything now David is almost at the end of his ministry but we realize here from the scripture as the scripture addressed us you know this looks like a father as seen of David in everybody we all look at Davi he nom other people he did wrong and all of that is true that's why the Word of God says but we have to realize from the beginning year the anger of the Lord was Kanda against Israel praise the Lord and we look into the world today and see all the things that is happening in a meaning and the different rise in the evil and and atheism in all of the things the ungodly things that is happening is just enough to bring God's judgment upon this world but we also have to realize that's a group of people that are on the earth now by God's Word must not go through the judgment of God must not go true that the tribulation now for God to be able to bring his judgment upon this word for all the evil the man is doing he had to set these people right he had to create things to be able to bring us to our place because we have to be out of here before the Great Tribulation comes praise the Lord I had a brother saying you know people are saying now well they said the brow when I go through the tribulation the bride is going through the tribulation I said well ok somebody is having an idea but I don't think that is God's will praise the Lord but that's what I'm trying to bring to us this morning you read through the scripture the Bible says 7,000 me and you look at it in a context of the world they hang out of the Lord I was candid against Israel the scripture did not see the anger of the law was candid against David you know but David was the gateway for God to be able to bring this George made upon the people he had to create some weakness upon his elected 7in sit on moved David just like bar Branham says the last their spirit is upon the people it's even affecting us we are backsliding on God and we are making excuses on God and and and and I mean we are neglecting God's Word when it's almost about a time word he should take his bride out of here we are waiting for that last elected one we are waiting for every member to find their place in the body praise the Lord just like he did to Jacob in the house of Leben he had to create some discomfort for Jacob to desire that is time to go back home just like he did with the Jews he had to create a discomfort that we call the the Holocaust for them to go back to their homeland and brother Branham says that was the tender hand of Jehovah and God will always do that now as we come to the end of the scripture there is something also that I want us to realize such David comes to the end of this he cried before God the scripture says I mean people are falling you read down in Psalm 91 David says and you know a thousand four by the writing in this one for about eleven it never came not him and then it was the same one crying before guarding and supplicating before God and saying O God your people he said let this thing come on me in my father's house praise the Lord but as the angel of the Lord and God came back to David and to tell him God was about to stop the plague the angel went right down to the thrashing floor of owner as we come down to to the end of there we will realize Davey realize when he got down there and that Jabba's eyes was about to offer him the place he loved Evie he knew that he was a man after God's own heart in you what he knew that David was going through at distressing time his people dying all over the place I said David if I can just do this for you you can have it David said I would not give anything to the Lord that cost me nothing praise the Lord it's not a place word he's he realized that he needs to step up his commitment he needs to step up his dedication to God he says I won't give anything to the Lord I won't make anything to the Lord that will not cost me if I would give anything to God it had to cost me something because I did something to bring this evil upon my people praise the Lord so that there was just a little bit to give us a background what I think relates to some 91 amen David was in his palace and in all of these things happening around him I believe he's there crying out to God on behalf of the people but just like I said what I'm looking at this this this morning it's Ned you know it's I mean it's all over the internet it's all over the radio and all the preachers I promising people the hiding place the most hiding place that we have is to run into Christ and run into Christ but this morning I don't want to be different what I want to say there God but this way it is coming to assure his bride that he's been hiding in her praise the Lord I want us to look at a word year that I was looking at the scripture says he that dwelleth in the secret of the Most High praise the Lord amen he that dwelleth in a secret of the Most High now I was looking at that word to do it Jesus says if you do already meaning my word abide in you if your body me my word bothering you the same as dwelling and I came across this someone shared this with me and and this this is what kind of a trick of this whole talk to me looking at the word here there's a word that speaks in a sense of weakness and that word is a Greek word spell or I K or s it means dwelling or a means house it's a word that derived from a Greek word that means dwelling or it means house now I was looking at that word this morning a little bit and I realized that it's a word that has that has lingered a little bit in the English in in in the English word it was this world was also called the Eternals Lord it was used there in you know Scotland and different part of the word it says you will find the instant classified in three main division this word noun is instantly classified in three million division at first first it means a house and sometime all the kinds of dwelling and secondly it will speak also of a household household ghouls in substance for which as I greatly said property they use their world also to classify property entirely it also speaks of the sense of a family now before I kind of come down to this I wanted to speak on on something I will not go ahead of myself let me just stay where I am before I get myself confused now so we see a three four distension of this word that speaks of a house it speaks of a house or a building that's one he speaks of everything that is within the house household goals it also have to do with family now you go back to exeter you will realize when God told Moses to build a tabernacle his desire was to do it among his people his desire was to do it and the deep sense was to inhabit so in Old Testament honor the shadow he dwelled among his people but God's intent was to inhabit his people now giving their instruction to Moses he told Moses that I will make my people a priesthood god intention was a family a priesthood family not just one tribe not just one group of people but an entire Israel was going to be a family of priesthood and his intention was to do it he that dwelleth in the secret of the Most High and the thing about this word also there is the other it means you know uh the the world week they also speak of a week of vessel you know this world week that speak of a week of a so that's what draw this this Greek word we are looking at and that's meaning a dwelling place now you take it in the context of god's word his train is made perfect in our weakness so he'd word in our weakness to show his strength is when we surrender our weakness to him he can come and ward in it ensure that he's a deliverer he's a healer and and he's a mighty conquer we have two ceramic our weakness to him and then if you also look at the top of this word you will realize there even when when when moses build the tabernacle that God was going to do it in all the entrance of the tabernacle he never asked that Moses you put a steel door he asked the Moses you pour curtains he poured Badgers king praise the Lord so I would tell you that great men warriors people in old war tactics when I want to hide himself they don't hide himself on a great you know castle and great the holy place is some of the most common place the reason is because in in in such a time of war everybody is thinking about protecting himself so the go and hide himself in the most common place a place that I will not be looking like it's a queue praise the Lord brother branham talks about his cave and the way he destroy his cave it was not that's the reason why he said it would not be so easy for anybody to find it because it was not too difficult to find it was a common place praise the Lord it was a common place and you check also in in in the scripture you realize even David then scripture there first samuel 19 this was when David told Janet on that your father's secret to kill me and Jonathan says why would he do that David says well that I just think there's something not right here Jonathan say okay I will go over and if I find out that he want to kill you I'm going to shoot an arrow and go to your secret place the reason why you think about it this was the army of Israel that I was looking for David the reason why they could not find him his hiding place was just simple places the army in their mind will be thinking about a great term you know please they will be thinking about well I know a shelter some words well I think he has gone to this place and David would just go on a wound rock inhye himself even when he came by to cut saw a garment he was hiding not too far from soul praise the Lord he was hiding not too far from Saul when I mean I'm thinking about you know who I think I know not of the fire he might be in a valid David was just somewhere not too far as a shepherd boy he knew how to get in the common place praise the Lord you asked hunters hunters would tell you the very same thing they know how to get in a common place and hide himself the secret of the Almighty praise the Lord the secret of the Almighty you think about it Almighty God the secret I he have held back from the foundation of the world he came and revealed it just in a humble simple Tabernacle to a simple group of people praise the Lord the word everybody stuck in their homes and trying to make their homes a safe place and people are reviving their commitment with God he's he's our refuge in the time of help we are running through Jesus when he's the one that been looking for a hiding place out of this wine to hide in the hearts of his little bride that's the reason why the Prophet can bring us a consolation there's a man here that can turn on the light he has been here all of this wine he's with this bride praise the Lord he's with this bride we I mean we are at a place word we have to start looking within looking and seeing all the things that he have done all through these years no people want to pump themself on down to to fasting I you know I tell all Jesus we need you we he's been here all of this wine he's been hiding behind these common services his comic conventions you meeting in all of these things he's been hiding dwelling with his bride we are talking about the secret place of the Most High praise the Lord the secret place of the Most High I was looking at another word it's a Greek word - and they have to do with weakness it says to resist no longer but to give a way to yield and I realize that sometimes you find people and they tell you about the weakness in their lives you know this is my weakness this is you know this this thing is my weakness and this thing is my weakness they talk about their weakness but actually when if if you just pause if you just fix that thing you'll realize that thing has been strong in that individual life I mean just like the scripture says he that cover his sin will not prosper and because people take these things as their weakness they find comfort in it they make excuses in it actually it's a strong word it's a strong wall and you realize that's the place where the devil is pinning you down because that's the reason why the scripture teaches us for us to confess our weakness and suppose the weakness resist it I mean when you can resist no longer and you're able to give away you are able to yield to the authority of God's Word to submit to give it to cast down before his feet if net that thing would become a stronghold it will become a mattre fortress in your life and the one that will be hiding behind it is the devil amen he's trying to use that thing you call your weakness as his fortress he's trying to hide behind it because you will not ceramic it because you will net you know you you I mean you net you and I give it away some people you know tempura is my weakness and there are very weakness they are talking about when they get angry they can break this building there and this is oh my goodness that's my weakness it's because you are keeping a strong man behind you keeping a strong man behind that weakness but you see when we when we surround our weakness and we confess our weakness and expose it to Christ when he can't bend his strength become perfect in that weakness then he becomes the strong man behind our weakness not condemning you I mean but convicting you and instructing you and comforting you whenever the thought of that is coming whenever the feeling of that is coming you go right back to the word you go right back to his promises praise the Lord the secret place of the Most High look at a larger in a time or farming word they go fine as a secret place for Elijah was a widow woman a widow woman and her son with the alas bread is that a strong place to send a prophet in a place of drought is that a place to send somebody in a natural mind that is just being cruel to the natural mind that's weakness saying that the very man that pronounced the judgment on the lane sending him to the house of a widow with her last meal God always hide behind weakness human weakness is his hiding place because that's what he brings his strength that's what he brings a delivery that's where he performed miracle Elijah where was his hiding place in the house of a barren woman a woman I tried to do right she lived right never had a child in all her life four year God who put a burden on her heart to build a chamber for his prophet I'm talking about God hiding place while the word is looking for the hiding play because that was the same thing at the birth of Jesus everybody was looking for a place to lodge they were looking for their good room to sleep in and a good place and he never had a place to be born he had to choose and stable to be born in because all the rooms were filled and now everybody is looking for the hiding place and we not even thinking about a place that he wants to hide everybody is looking for a safe place in and I mean God had just brought the world to a stop and said thing about it there is no nation that is safe because this plague coronaviruses everywhere just bringing us to the place to realize we cannot deal our hopes on earthly things we cannot build our hopes on affluent nations we cannot build our hopes on our earthly homes there is no every place that is safe praise the Lord the Savior's place is the place that God is hiding amen David was God's man even his God was bringing his judgment because on a shadow and types he was dwelling with that man after his own heart he would not touch him out of these things I'm not trying to say it is the bride that is bringing this thing on the earth but I'm trying to say this is to bring us to a wake-up call because Brad Branham trot out before the seal that God was hiding in simplicity and that simple place that God was going to high in was his bride that simple place that he was going to hide in was his bride right before the seals brother Branham give I mean the Lord giving sisters in a tabernacle dream about the very same seals that will be revealed brothers in the tabernacle dream about very seen seals that was going to be revealed a junior Jackson in all of these people while I was gone doing that even before the seals were revealed he was trying to show that this dispensation is God dwelling among his people even if you will use the Prophet to bring us a revelation and interpretation God and now seal yourself in one man God is dwelling in his people his people is his household his people is his hiding place that is the reason why I says people as his bride we need to wake up and behave ourself kick our self out of this fear and kick our self out of this carelessness in thinking that you notice the people out there we are here for the reason and and all of these things is happening for the reason this is time to clean up God's hiding place to take all the warden s and all the filthiness out of God's hiding place all the ungodliness out of God's hiding place where Branham talks about this bride gets into a place to speak the word how would we ever get to that place not in our own strength God has to be a body in our tabernacle praise the Lord the secret place of the Most High is the most high secret place that we are talking about if you can find a secret place of the Most High abide in it you can realize that God has chosen your tabernacle God has set you aside out of these years for this very hour that we are in we are getting to the place of our showdown we have gone through trials we have gone through different doctrines we have gone through different waves of the message but he have kept us for this hour because the prophet of God spoke about it we're missing link will be restored were the people of God will be able to see God visiting them in their homes praise the Lord I was thinking about it just driving to church you know if we if we have a you know you know all of this you know time of going to working in different basic thing we haven't and sometimes in some homes you know people just use that as an escape because they can stand their wives and they can stand a husband and they can or they can stay in their children they just used that for an escape praise the Lord and if God would give us this little window for us to catch ourselves and say what is that thing that I can deal with let me deal with it now let me be able to stay right there for the proper God says they are intend of mate the vial is on to death after year we cross over and we hold one another hands right in a millennium if he's giving us this little winner there those those are those are the little things for us to be able to appreciate our home imagine the dwelling-place speaks of the family and a man would think or a woman would think she more spiritual than her husband or the man would think he had the Holy Ghost and his wife don't have the Holy Ghost and all of these things you know this is salvation it's an individual effect when it comes down to this rapture it's a family affair it's a family affair and man must be able to have confidence in his wife faith the wife must be able to have confidence in the hosmer faith they also confidence in the children's faith and the children having confidence in in the parents faith and the house is just a tabernacle of faith no mother were struggle we are going through we have to believe my husband is the son of God my wife is a daughter of God my children are children of God and this house is the house of God praise the Lord what does it benefit me for me to think there are more spiritual than my wife if God is going to hold me responsible for her so that means I'm not going in a rapture until I have her to be just like me praise the Lord sit on how to push theory he had to move damn it to trespass he had to move David in and all of this pressure has been moving us in one way or the other this thing is about God secret place he have choosing the weak things of the world that's why Paul said he have chosen the weak things of the world no matter what our weaknesses is our failure is God rich Emerson has brought to us a talking message weaving the talking before our eyes no matter what rehab weakness was a prostitute we might call her go rich immerse a broad a talking message to her house if you can just get honored this talking and submit your weaknesses to God then using it as an excuse because when you use it as an excuse you are building a fortress for the devil we're talking about God had in place it's a secret place of the Most High our human mind we are so scared we are looking for our hiding place God is saying no don't run to me I'm looking for a hiding place he said I'm looking for the honey people don't run to me please I'm the one looking for the hiding place can you imagine Joseph running you can you can you just imagine in your mind Joseph coming coming if all of those people in in Judy airing in in birth to him who are just had the idea and Joseph coming knocking at their door and asking is there a pleasure I my wife she's in trouble if some aliquot just got it and get it give me a bedroom now that we know if if it were ever happy now for a skeleton your your honeymoon chamber was the place you were just run Joseph's up to the God of heaven looking for the place to be birth and there was no room I believe is the same thing that is happening he's looking for a hiding place and everybody is running thinking that he should hide them this time but he want to hide in you he want to hide in your home he want to hide in your trucks you want to hide use your Tabernacle a body would that prepare me that's what he said that's what great men I remember during the time of the war in Liberia all of those men I remember even my dad were scared that all the men in the area refused to be called by their names we couldn't they couldn't call them by their names their friends couldn't call them by the names if they want to call them they have to call them a faith father decidable refer to you as faith father no one who can can call you scatter if you didn't call your last name just faith father and this other person Father in faith mother and yeah because everybody was disguising themselves you know and I remember one instance my dad he had a word short pants and I mean big I mean in some ways I mean his name was out there in politics and all of that and and this this one came so funny because he was wearing my sister Sanders some kind of us flip on Sanders he was wearing and what were they doing there they were trying to find a hiding place they were trying to disguise themselves like even saw going to the Witch of Endor he disguised himself he was finding a hiding place that he would not be recognized and they don't find hiding place in God's your thing if a poor and if so who have wore the most expensive garment even the tribe industry we know that was so he had to look for that they're ugly is poor or garment in and everything grid me in the time of war when men and sent out on recurrence a butter scan they dressed like homeless people they would not like a homeless man they will walk down the street and they are taking information but they're in a homeless garment just like crazy people they would sleep on the street for many days just to be able to get via information hi in week things so the God of heaven that's chosen a gentle bride has choosing comes down to allow this age the most evil evil age week age to find a hiding place can you think about God hiding in this age with with all the evil that is going on even in the maze even in the maze of this crisis people don't dressing themself going on the beach offer of Florida and all of the in the midst of all of these damn staring right at the face of the people see how the heart of man they feel but God call chosen to come to your home every time you turn on that taped every time you open your Bible to get in communion with him he's not coming to visit sometimes he comes to visit and the way you entertain him he decided to stay because he's looking for a hiding place praise the Lord David one time you running away from Saul he went down there to the to the land of the Philistines and then I mean he I mean he disguised himself never knew what these guys meant was he who are like a sheep ball he could I like a newspaper boy he could I like a like like a mechanic look for oh and just whiz it on himself with tools in his hands you don't know nothing about nothing bored but he's getting away from Saul right there in the land of Philistine he went down there and they can't give him a place to stay and the Philistines were going to battle and somebody pick up David and went to King is and went to the king and says let he not go with us it's did not the same David let he not go with us or as he would turn against us and whenever David was discover he had to slay go to another place and hide himself he was hiding himself in simple places and that's what the God of heaven is doing hiding himself in simple places the hiding place of the almighty he want to choose our home as a hiding place when all the homes are playing wall and music and dirty movies God want your home as a hiding place well the message of the hour will be plain Kristine's sounds will be playing Christon music that will motivate you testimonies will be playing he want your home to be a hiding place his hiding place he can go down to Washington because he realized all of those people I just Liars they are just seeking them a better job for themselves and in different things and you know at the end of the day they're all going to bow down to the B system and bring persecution against his bride he want to come to your little house no matter how old is your house that does not matter with him no matter if your house you notice it's now furnished like the house of this world is now matter with God what he's looking for is that atmosphere that work on his spirit not a home where you will be proud and pick up your newspaper but urban MC and just leave him in the corner he never felt welcome in Simon's house the hiding place of the Almighty let just think about that it's a household it's a family this bride is a family like I've said over and over we will never succeed as a church until we have the revelation that the Church of Jesus Christ is the family of God and when we started treat one another and not taking lightly when we say brother days and insists of this and realize that it is of one blood God has saved all of us and he has brought us to this body to be a family to be a support system to one another praise the Lord if this is the place that we choose to bring our family bring our wives and children this is the place that we choose to grow in faith and we know that we have an obligation to keep it as the house of God there's no reason of running gossip and running you know creating differences in in complicating ourself in our own talk because all of those things does not matter to God what do you think and how you feel that is supposed to be a does not matter to God because his church is a mystical body he knows what he's doing look all through the scripture he has always hated himself in the weaklings badger skin just an animal skin stink he had curtains in the tabernacle he never told his people to use baths and ions to protect the holy place because he knows he's the protector all he need to do is just come in he's the sustainer that's why he did you don't ask you to clean up he's the one that cleans up all he want is just come in open the door that he come in and he would do the cleaning he's going to make that wrong make that place so comfortable for himself all he needs is to jest since that we're coming spirit that you are welcome and you're not looking over your shoulder you not so speaker there is not something that you are hiding if you see you are welcome he gets in every room he cleans it up that that is the spirit of a man that fees welcome you get into a energy into a sin house and you feel welcome you see something on the floor you just pick it up because you know you feel welcome in this house you know they're not supposed to be there oh I saw this thing on the floor is that where it's supposed to be oh no sorry you feel welcome but a person that is now welcome that just said back the windy I asked oversee to get this thing on the floor hope they keep this place so nasty work better check a critical spirit it just showed that you are not feeling welcoming in the house if you feel welcome nothing stop you from asking for that for a cold drink of water or a cup of tea that's the spirit of you feeling welcome do you know you can make someone to someone Toto to be more welcoming in their home they can feel your presence you feel like this person just feel like a family and it's not hard for them to say go in the fridge and get anything you want to drink by you sitting down there do you want water to drink no can I offer you a cup of no as soon as you take in the attitude the person would just start closing every doors now because they don't know what to open to you he didn't access to clean our lives he said behold I stand at the door and knock and all he asks is just open up what is that thing you struggling with open up and he will step right in there and he would clean it up and you and him we enjoyed the sweet atmosphere in that place that's the secret place of the Most High he's the one that's needing a place in this our precious Lord I tell you with all of these things happening if we don't every every did not had a lockdown churches would be fought because people will be running to churches thinking that they are finding the hiding place churches were before people will be recreating himself to God because they had seen the end of the world right before the eyes but now he have us to be home and saying the church is just for the why I want to do it in your house I want to do it in your house I want you to experience my peace in your home I want you to experience between one another with the family with the children with the household I want you to experience my peace we can go into the city the refusion we can talk about you know the different things that David speaks about but what my mind is on this morning it's a secret place of the Most High Jesus taught that from the beginning of his ministry the disciples never grab it it's just when you pray go into the secret place the Father that see in secret will reward you openly where he called the secret place in the chamber in the prayer room see it in secret he sees the secret of your heart he knows your thoughts he knows the things that are going through your mind the very things you are struggling with he knows him praise the Lord that's a secret place mind our parting I'm saying Siri I'm not calling you I say in secret place praise the Lord the secret place of the Most High he's the one that is looking for the dwelling place in the prophet of God has taught us how to apply the talking howdy he says clean up the house clean up the house how to apply the talking rededicate ourselves expose our weaknesses to cries don't don't yourself or law you law you know my weaknesses you know much talk about it be able to talk about it talk about it express a hurt of their weakness like that like Davey said I hate it with perfect a train praise the Lord that just by our hairs now while our sister would come in play or something think about it the secret place of the Most High don't look for it don't look for it from a preacher and look afraid you have been that place that he's been working on for this very hour he's been working on you he's been bringing you from one thing to another thing he's been exposing you to all your weaknesses he's I mean he's been convicting you he's been doing all of these things just to prepare a body a body would not prepare me a body he's been working on for this very hour you will be their secret place the secret place of the Most High his strength is made perfect in our weakness wherever we are this morning [Music] that just go into our chamber go into your heart this morning now you just opening a religious door to him can we open every doors [Music] oh there's a man yet I can turn on the light [Music] you don't have to be afraid you don't have to be afraid that if the rapture take place one of this morning you will be left behind you have to get their full assurance in your heart that God has kept you for this hour for God is hidden simplicity that's what brother branham brought us in the seals that's what the CEO is all about the people that God would be seal in a brine that he will be locked in her desire he will be locked in her ambition [Music] like David said I would not give anything to the law that cost me nothing [Music] we will be faithful in our dedication faithful in our commitment who will be answers there will be the desire in our hearts to be anxious to do the lost building like brother Branham said those Gentiles just to know that they were desiring a water from birth to him they were ready to risk their lives his wish was their command just for all and the word the word of God he's wanting us to read our Bible and pray everyday he wanted us to get down in our closet and weep weep for the abomination that is done in the land like David he cried to God cry to God and say O God have mercy this plague that is upon the lane people dying knowing that I will not come nigh him he was weeping for the people out there and that's what we should be doing until this situation can move our hearts can touch our hearts word we can really get down on our knees and cry and cry [Music] for the aim of saying that is perishing we'll be guilty [Music] people are scared to death we can get on our knees and pray for our neighbors get on our knees and pray for the health workers that are risking their lives they are standing right between life and death not to be careless and just selfish lord cover my family with a blood law cover my home father may this evil don't don't come to me God already said it will not come value [Music] of praying for the people I'm telling you there are some nurses they don't know god they get up they get off from work to go home they get alcohol just to drinking and calm their nerves but those people have a heart to go out there to be able to save a young child to be able to do anything they can do they have a heart to save a dying mother you have some doctors out there they don't know God when they leave home look at their wives and children some of them had to be sleeping in separate bedroom because they have to go to work while you and myself can do is to get on our knees and cry to God and say Lord be merciful or God be merciful be merciful it's good for us to cheer up it's good for us to laughing and the different things [Music] not just being serious like the Deaf injured is in our home it's good for us to keep that sweet atmosphere of laughter and sharing one another up yeah when we get down on our knees we must mean business with God we must be business with God just like it was with David if God will bring an end to this plague it will be because his children are crying out to him saying God have mercy have mercy and it's all out of the desire that we want one more so to be safe or out of the desire that we want our loved ones to be saved [Music] some weak Airways Amy lord please is me
