[1:11] there's something in you or do you want
[1:13] to serve a Creed somewhere say I go to
[1:15] church I'm just as good as you are
[1:16] see if you hold an old birth rights you
[1:20] will never see it you can't see it but
[1:23] if you do hold a possession of this
[1:26] Birthright you can't help from seeing it
[1:28] amen because it's part of you and you're
[1:32] a part of it
[1:33] how could I know my other mother give me
[1:35] birth
[1:36] how could I have a father that his own
[1:38] blood is in me how could I organize
[1:40] Charles Brown for me and my father I
[1:42] could not do it I'm willing to stand his
[1:44] reproach or anything else because I am
[1:47] his son
[1:49] Hallelujah
[1:51] Landing the Son of God and he was the
[1:54] word of God
[1:55] how can I deny that Bible being truth
[1:58] that Jesus Christ isn't the same
[2:00] yesterday today and forever and see in
[2:03] the hour that we're living in we eat our
[2:05] Easter in the church
[2:09] Direction
[2:10] renew a resurrection to power of pain
[2:14] man and women to stand out for that
[2:16] which is God's Vindicated word
[2:20] say well we have in our Youth for Christ
[2:21] that's all right our church is having a
[2:23] meeting we want to know so many members
[2:25] nothing against that that's all right
[2:27] but that's only the atmosphere
[2:31] that might be an old hens feathers
[2:34] but if you'll get in the right
[2:36] atmosphere there he'll hatch an eagle if
[2:38] you're an eagle egg and if you were for
[2:40] our date of God the Sid you can't help
[2:42] from seeing it
[2:44] you're coming forth in her Resurrection
[2:47] that's the way the Baptist is born
[2:49] that's why the Methodist is born in the
[2:51] resurrection of that day
[2:53] but they turned off to him instead of an
[2:55] eagle
[2:56] I said not long ago going down from
[2:58] Tucson
[2:59] I watched a very strange thing I've seen
[3:02] a hawk sitting on the wire down there
[3:05] that Hulk has long lost its
[3:07] identification
[3:09] it used to be a bird next to the eagle
[3:11] it could not follow the eagle no by no
[3:14] means nothing can fall an eagle
[3:16] but he was a hawk
[3:18] Christ is the eagle and the church
[3:21] should at least be a hawk they could fly
[3:23] higher than any other rest of verse but
[3:25] that Hulk has become soft
[3:28] it's lost his identification
[3:31] he sits on the telephone wires and waits
[3:34] for some dead rabbit
[3:36] amen
[3:37] he hops like a vulture and instead of
[3:40] flying like a hawk
[3:42] oh my brother's sister you Pentecostal
[3:45] people which is my own dear people
[3:48] the church is losing its identification
[3:51] it's coming down and depending on some
[3:53] dead formal Creed
[3:55] instead of flying in the Heavenly Center
[3:57] for precious manner
[3:59] a Hulk used to hunt his own manner but
[4:01] today he takes what the automobiles run
[4:03] over what the Boxers eat
[4:05] [Music]
[4:06] the hot psych one he looks like one we
[4:08] saw adorned ourselves in the modern
[4:10] world our women cutting their hair and
[4:13] wearing shorts are a man but not enough
[4:16] backbone to stand the pulpit and tell
[4:17] the truth
[4:19] we've long got soft on the word whole
[4:22] gods and the Holy Ghost and look out let
[4:25] me go somewhere that's ready to stand
[4:27] now no matter what takes place that'll
[4:29] soar into the unknown
[4:31] not set on the telephone wires and look
[4:34] for some Sunday school literature to
[4:36] come in let me have the word in it as
[4:38] precious and a power demonstration of
[4:40] the Holy Ghost amen
[4:42] we need an Easter
[4:44] a resurrection that's potentials my
[4:48] friend if you're satisfied with sets a
[4:50] Karen of the world there's something
[4:53] wrong
[4:54] my sister my brother let me say to you
[4:57] send Godly fear knowing that I may never
[4:59] live to see an Easter again
[5:01] but there's one thing sure what a
[5:04] genuine four deemed Son of God by the
[5:07] word of God hears that voice of God
[5:10] he'll rise and go to me to
[5:13] it's the potential that he's going to
[5:15] meet the real living word as he was the
[5:18] bride will meet the groom she's a part
[5:20] of his body
[5:21] notice long have we we're losing our
[5:25] identification we come on Wednesday
[5:27] night some of us others stay home to us
[5:30] who love Susie
[5:31] televisions all kinds of worldly things
[5:34] all kinds of entertainments to keep you
[5:36] away from church
[5:38] long have we lost it our seminaries our
[5:41] schools are putting out a bunch of
[5:42] rookies with a whole lot of Theology and
[5:45] entertainment and everything in the
[5:47] church to take the place of the prayer
[5:49] meeting
[5:50] we've talked rest and try to fulfill
[5:52] what the modernists try to do bring them
[5:55] in you will never win them but that they
[5:57] got more of that you have
[5:59] you ain't got no business on your ground
[6:01] on their ground let them come over on
[6:03] yours for their real baptism is shining
[6:06] further real power of the Resurrection
[6:09] don't try to build a church like theirs
[6:11] don't try to have a pastor like that
[6:13] don't try to do this other or cooperate
[6:15] with the world
[6:17] they shine
[6:19] with Hollywood the real gospel goes with
[6:22] power
[6:24] Eagles hear that they don't look for a
[6:26] shine
[6:27] they look for a goal going with humility
[6:31] glowing with love glowing with power
[6:33] that's what the real Eagle hunts you
[6:35] can't scratch in a barnyard and please
[6:37] him you'll never be able to do it you'll
[6:40] never touch him because he don't believe
[6:41] it let that voice spring from the
[6:44] heavens I am here that was dead or alive
[6:46] again amen something takes place I am
[6:50] the same yesterday today and forever and
[6:52] it shall come to pass in the last days
[6:54] I'll pour out of myself upper Halls
[6:57] flesh
[6:59] glory to God I'll Quicken your Immortal
[7:01] language I'll Quicken your Immortal
[7:03] tongues I'll give you the evidence so
[7:05] I'm going to bring in the resurrection
[7:06] with me
[7:07] hungry hearted Eagles reach for that
[7:10] just as hard as they can it's a pearl of
[7:12] great price if they sell everything else
[7:14] to go by
[7:17] God help us friend
[7:19] our churches are losing their
[7:20] identification
[7:22] that's quickly now how to go to Sun
[7:24] what's the action of those disciples are
[7:26] scared they know Jesus was the truth
[7:31] but you see it was against a popular
[7:32] idea
[7:34] the proper religion of the hour
[7:37] the most strictest religion Sarah
[7:39] Pharisees Sadducees no so forth they're
[7:42] close to Clans and denominations
[7:44] they were they were against that heresy
[7:47] but Jesus was the identified word
[7:51] and Jesus is the Holy Ghost
[7:54] and spirit
[7:56] amen a little while in a world see if
[7:58] you know more you shall see me not the
[8:00] body the life that was in in God
[8:03] it is upon the church to call Sons like
[8:05] he did then obedient
[8:07] I'll always do that which is pleasing to
[8:10] my Father which one of you confused me
[8:12] of sin in other words sin is unbelief
[8:14] what has the word said about me that I
[8:16] haven't done
[8:18] show me what the word said that I do it
[8:21] I didn't do which one can accuse me
[8:23] which one can lay your fingers on me and
[8:25] say that I haven't fulfilled my father's
[8:27] word or when the Pentecostal Church gets
[8:30] to that spot
[8:32] who can accuse me of unbelief
[8:35] oh Christians be identified not as a
[8:38] hawk but an eagle that Hulk is soft
[8:41] he'll come down you never see Eagle
[8:42] doing that you don't ever do that he
[8:45] hunts his own food out of the blue God's
[8:47] prepared him so he could see it he gets
[8:49] fresh Manna not something is dead
[8:52] in the Hebrews when he crossed to the
[8:53] Wilderness they eat try to eat dead
[8:56] Manna it'll become stagnant
[8:58] it had it had wheel tails in it
[9:02] you know what we mean it's a
[9:03] contaminated rotten maggots is in it why
[9:07] would I eat a food that had been dead
[9:09] years ago
[9:11] it might be in farm and shape but it
[9:13] isn't fresh we got to get food every
[9:16] generation new
[9:19] so does the eagle look for that food
[9:21] every generation as we're in our journey
[9:23] notice now let's take some people again
[9:26] let's take some of the Old Testament
[9:28] prophets see what they did let's look
[9:30] first at Stevens house Stevens in the
[9:33] midst of that Sanhedrin Council when
[9:36] that counselor brought him up there that
[9:37] great assembly of Believers there are
[9:40] supposed to be Believers brought him up
[9:41] and tried to condemn him why he said you
[9:44] stiff necks uncircumcised in the heart
[9:45] and ears you always resist the Holy
[9:48] Ghost
[9:49] that's that eternal life is your
[9:51] father's did it back in Earth through
[9:53] the prophets so are you doing it today
[9:55] and they messed upon him with their
[9:57] teeth they didn't want to hear that
[9:58] here's the gifts their Credence against
[9:59] their denomination and they stoned the
[10:02] man to death and he raised his hands up
[10:03] and look towards him and say I see
[10:04] Heavens open and Jesus stands the right
[10:06] side why he had the resurrection
[10:10] quickening power in him that took him
[10:12] into the bosoms of Jesus
[10:14] notice quickly now look at Philip down
[10:18] there in a great Revival
[10:19] having a Revival for it had been
[10:21] garrisoned for any man well if we had
[10:23] got a big cooperation amongst the
[10:25] churches and everything down there is
[10:27] having a great Revival and the
[10:29] quickening power of God's Pope James
[10:30] said Stephen
[10:32] may have said this you're having a great
[10:34] Revival but I got one man I want you to
[10:37] talk to
[10:38] and Stephen's obedient no matter what it
[10:40] is how much criticism oh Stevens you
[10:43] can't leave but I can
[10:45] God said so and he went out into the
[10:47] desert and out there he found this
[10:49] eunuch and what happened he said has uh
[10:53] if thou Believers with all thine heart
[10:55] that Jesus is the son of God uh I'll
[10:57] baptize him when he baptized him look he
[10:59] was quickened by this quickening power
[11:01] to leave a Revival of thousands of
[11:04] people to go out into the desert to one
[11:07] man
[11:09] oh that'll be against all reasons
[11:12] see while these ten thousand won't you
[11:14] hear but there's one wanting out there
[11:18] see and the quickening power sent into
[11:21] God's provided place
[11:23] Hallelujah man and women it'll make you
[11:25] stand to your feet it'll make you do the
[11:28] things that God wants you to do I don't
[11:30] care what somebody else says about the
[11:32] neighbor said well that person's lost
[11:33] her mind pray all night they'll read the
[11:35] Bible I don't care what they say it's
[11:36] what God called you to do yes that's
[11:39] right or they say we can't have these
[11:41] old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals like
[11:43] oh yes we can too you can have it in
[11:45] yourself
[11:46] and you are the majority in God no
[11:48] matter what the rest of them think
[11:50] notice after in obedience
[11:53] listen close now after obeying God to
[11:55] his word when he fulfilled his mission
[11:58] that quickening power that he received
[12:00] at Pentecost caught him away
[12:03] quick in his body
[12:05] miles and miles away he was taken in the
[12:07] spirit
[12:09] and was found over in another country
[12:10] somewhere
[12:11] quickening power of God and if we be
[12:15] Pentecostals that same power
[12:17] that raised up Jesus from the dead if it
[12:20] dwells in your mortal bodies
[12:22] all right notice let's take another man
[12:25] with his quickly power there was a man
[12:27] Way Long Ago by the name of Enoch
[12:32] want a new thing come along when
[12:33] something come along and say well now we
[12:35] have go back to the old school or this
[12:36] side the other Enoch walk with God
[12:40] whatever God said dude Enoch never
[12:42] missed one word
[12:44] he walked with God what was he he was
[12:47] the son of God he was an eagle and been
[12:51] called to that day and when he come to
[12:53] him he was so full of that quickening
[12:55] power remember he'd walk 500 years or
[12:57] more before God and not one time had he
[13:00] missed his word
[13:01] not one time did he misbehave himself
[13:04] not one time did he do but kept the
[13:07] testimony everything that God told him
[13:09] knew he went and done it no argument
[13:11] about it he just wasn't done it no
[13:12] matter what anybody else thought he went
[13:14] and done it why he was full of that
[13:16] quickening power and when it comes time
[13:18] for the old man to die God is sent out a
[13:20] letter and he walked up home
[13:22] he quickened him and took his mortal
[13:25] body up in a rapture
[13:28] amen that's that quickly power
[13:31] look at Elijah after his work was
[13:33] finished on Earth he was so full of that
[13:36] quickening power he condemned them
[13:38] Jackie Kennedy haircuts in his day
[13:41] he told Jesse about what he thought of
[13:43] her he told them preachers and Priests
[13:45] what was right and wrong and they didn't
[13:47] believe him but he condemned them
[13:49] painted face women and things so bad and
[13:51] he's so full of that quickly power to
[13:53] nothing could harm him
[13:55] God had fed him in the heavens tuck him
[13:56] out and set him aside and he was so full
[13:58] of creating power come time to Die the
[14:00] Jordan opened up and he just walked to
[14:02] sit down a chair and talking about home
[14:04] so full of their quickening power he
[14:07] become a true genuine Son of God
[14:12] notice he had a successor and his name
[14:15] was Elisha
[14:17] and Elisha had a double Post in this
[14:19] quick and Power
[14:20] see he had a double potion of it now he
[14:24] preached for about 80 years or he's
[14:25] about 80 years old he touched sick and
[14:27] die
[14:28] now he didn't get to go home like Elijah
[14:31] did see both of them is represented
[14:32] there in the church some Saints Go in
[14:35] some resting but notice when Elijah was
[14:38] taken up in the rapture
[14:40] then Elisha went to sleep and God full
[14:45] acquainting power look at his prophecy
[14:48] just before he died
[14:49] okay
[14:51] now let me show you I don't care if
[14:53] you're dead or where you're at that
[14:55] quickening power never leads
[14:58] years and years after his death
[15:02] his meaning rotted away the skin worms
[15:05] that heated up
[15:07] but they were packing a dead man one day
[15:09] throwed him in on that bones and there
[15:11] was much quickening power there actually
[15:12] man come back to life again
[15:15] Hallelujah
[15:17] raise him up from the dead because that
[15:21] quickening power that was upon that
[15:23] saint of God never left him
[15:26] stayed right on those bones all remember
[15:29] we are flesh of his flesh bone of his
[15:33] bones if we are his bride
[15:36] death won't bother that quickening power
[15:38] at all
[15:40] though the skin worms destroys this body
[15:42] yet in my flesh shall I see God
[15:45] glory to God
[15:49] I don't know what to say
[15:52] not a hope for an old man like me
[15:55] knowing I see my end time that I
[15:57] understand that's 56 years old that's
[15:59] that's a little bitty boy I've stood
[16:01] here trying to Proclaim this but I know
[16:03] that in me nothing good that I have
[16:07] nothing I've done
[16:08] but in me is that quickening power it
[16:11] quickened me one day for the things of
[16:13] the world upon the eternal life all the
[16:16] things that's happened I've seen Visions
[16:18] foretold things he's never let nothing
[16:19] fail yet I spoke in other tongues I
[16:22] prophesied I've done those things by the
[16:24] spirit of God that dwelt in me that's
[16:26] quickly power I know that someday my
[16:30] redeemer is living now and it's Sunday
[16:32] when he comes these bones shall rise
[16:34] again they're going to meet him oh
[16:36] Hallelujah you may fear me in the sea
[16:38] burn it up wherever you want to that
[16:40] quickening power is eternal
[16:44] I feel Easter right now yes sir I've had
[16:47] it for years
[16:49] it's in me it's in you
[16:52] if you the spirit that raised Jesus from
[16:55] the dead dwells in your mortal bodies
[16:58] it's Quicken you from the things of the
[17:00] world to the word of God only
[17:02] yeah it's Quicken you from this life to
[17:04] life eternal
[17:06] you were once dead is sin and trespasses
[17:09] has now been quicker together to sit and
[17:12] play Heavenly places with Christ Jesus
[17:14] feasting on manna from above seeing the
[17:18] hand God made manifested prove the
[17:22] promise of this day as it was in the
[17:24] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[17:26] coming of the son of man they were
[17:27] eating drinking marrying giving and
[17:29] married and as it was in the days of lot
[17:31] so will it be in the hours that the son
[17:34] of man will be revealed on Earth not Son
[17:36] of God no more son of man come back as
[17:39] the prophetic message for the last day
[17:41] when that eagle will be flying not that
[17:43] line
[17:44] not the ox and the sacrifice age see
[17:47] every time a religious power went forth
[17:50] to meet the challenge of the political
[17:51] power of the world when the lion raised
[17:53] up the religious power it went to meet
[17:55] the Roman power
[17:57] and then when it come to sacrifice our
[17:59] the ox went because he's a sacrifice
[18:01] Beast to the Lord then come the
[18:03] reformers down through the church Ages
[18:05] come the face of a man and that
[18:07] reformers have been sentenced Luther
[18:09] Wesley Hall Calvin on down down
[18:12] Pentecostal age but in the last message
[18:15] it went forth there come a flying eagle
[18:20] reveal time the word of God made

[18:38] are flesh of his flesh and born of his
[18:41] bone as God raised his bones and flesh

[18:46] man that has the potentials amen death
[18:49] cannot take him Jesus said all the
[18:52] father has given me will come to me how

[19:19] anointed ones believe that
[19:22] what is a messiah what is a messiah
[19:25] Messiah is Anointed one
[19:28] and now if he was the Messiah being the
[19:31] anointed one for that day to fulfill the
[19:33] word of God
[19:35] to be the Redeemer and the anointed one

[20:07] resurrection we are sitting with him in
[20:09] the resurrection

[20:18] getting the Holy Ghost being saved in
[20:19] the Rapture run me over with and gone
[20:22] said Elias has already come and they did
[20:24] that and you knew it now see notice
