Nigeria and uh he's a he's a personal friend of mine but uh more more more over than there he's he's uh one of brother Del's Deacon he sered with brother de father and uh he's been the Deacon of the church over 20 years praise the Lord over 20 years I think that is uh that is that's a good standing in faith amen if a man can be able to Bear the Deacon office for 20 years praise the Lord over 20 years Amen brother shalad and his family they were my my uh one of my major host in Nigeria every time I was there I was there with them so whenever he comes he choose to come and just spend a couple of days with us so he's been around since Wednesday and uh he be leaving back to Texas tomorrow uh where he will do some of his uh medical checkup and then he will be heading back home to his wife and uh in his post of Duty so I told him as his uh I will have you come and greet the church so uh come on brother Shah come and greet the people bring all the greetings from from Nigeria from West Africa from uh praise the Lord God bless you friend God bless you yes sir Lord bless you yeah I'm surey here now um I think I do it Pastor was saying something on Wednesday I want you to bring the word and I was telling the Lord that God let this call pass over me and I thank the Lord that that cup has pass over me um one thing with this church is that I want to appreciate you all I would rather want to bring a testimony and just give a little word of exhortation then I will hand over the pit to the pastor like the the Pastor said since we get to know one another 2003 we have strike a bond because I see in him a true gentle man of God a man that is so sincere and if you know me I love people that give regard to the word you become my friend because all that I do is I want to know God more and it's going to be a strength to me then I'm going to draw you closer and I'm going to honor you respect your office and be everything a lot of good standing Ministers of the world in Nigeria my close friends till some people will think that I'm also a reverend and I said well I'm not a reverend I'm just a little servant of the Lord serving the post of a deacon and like the prophet says sometimes you see though the Deacon have voted for or elected by the pastor nominated for the church but he more stter than the pastor's office right I hope you believe that Pastor is Pastor you have some compassion he will have some things but you see the decking are stet by the word it's either you line up or like we he in the world this morning in the Sunday School the prophet said if the children are not behaving well and uh you can't get them to behave in the church you keep them at home they going to become Rudy is two things the parent are also not lining of the children that maybe the parent also need discipline on that point you see the being coming hard and sometimes a lot of people will love their pastor but they hate the decking but uh it's a thing that we we we are used to like the uh Pastor said I've been a dick now going to 22 years and uh I'm a young old man you know when B BR passed 50 he said I'm getting old I'm 25 * 2 so if some of us in some days time I'll be 55 years so that means that we be coming up good now but you see in 20 12 I was doing some consult working somewhere in in Nigeria then this sickness just came and strike me I don't know where I from then it took me to the point of death I was almost dying uh I didn't know that uh people were just ping me up even my wife sometimes she would go to somewhere to cry that this man is going and um I have a brother in us when he felt this the the level of the sickness he asked me to come down so we came down but one thing is that I've been joining this church services since uh 2012 I I screen your service and I know that you people are always praying for me so I'm a testimony that God answer your prayer amen that I'm here I'm standing you know my younger brother just sent prayer requests everywhere everywhere in Nigeria people are praying and um then I was the pastor visited me when I was in Texas December 2013 he came to spend good six days with me encouraging and praying along and um I think 2014 was my first time to just come and say in my sickness I came manag to come and say hello to you people and that's well I started knowing some people um and um I appreciate God for his grace upon you people's life I'm thanking God to see people still standing for the world uh it's not an easy thing to stand for this message I'm telling you the pressure out there is so strong the pressure to make men to fall to derail from the principle of this world is so strong and that's why if you are married you need to pray for one another if your wife is working your husband is working there are theor out there who are ready to ensure that they fail but what keep all of us in the world is when you have a Praying partner one that you can trust your life with husband should able to trust his life to his wife wife should be able to trust his life to the husband and say the best prayer partner is your wife but once said get a prayer partner the first best prayer partner is your wife then as your wife you can look for some brothers too that you f or sisters that you feel they are strong by the word and say let us be holding ourself in prayer and uh one thing that the prophet said is that which I was sharing with the pastor is that the danger of sin is with our children the the way we come to the Lord majority of them are not seeing that way maybe because they did not suffer for it you know some of us are Pentecostal some of us were in the Orthodox Churches some of us were in the white government churches I'm a a d person I was a Methodist and a white government church back in neria until the Lord come across my way and I will tell you when I believe this message I suffer for it the parents will stand against you the fact you are bringing some odd doctrines some odd belief maybe they F that is an i they expect you to be and the way you are going you may not likely meet up with that but I always tell people it is God that hold that not man believeing the Lord doesn't say you're going to be poor believe in the Lord says the Lord will care for you the Lord will care for you and uh I'm going to encourage our children said when you come to Christ before 21 nobody can DeRay you from this message children there is a blessing serving the lord there is a blessing obeying your parent is the only Commandment that come with a promise don't say because you started growing up you started having features like mommy or daddy so you f they talk I can talk no humble thyself because one day you're also going to grow up to Bear children and you will you if you feel the pain of Disobedience from children you will always remember that I did that to my parents so please humble thyself in the message he said go tell go tell he preached that message go tell he said we have to run God had to send a messenger for us with a message for us to tell the word and luckily for us is that God send a messenger to us in this age every day I leave I I want to than the Lord I used to tell my son I said do you know why I believe this message two things is this if I want to see a sincere Prophet I've not seen one like William Braham the only way we believe him more is that the despite that is a prophet he doesn't hide his mistake it doesn't hide his errors he say it right while preaching so to such a man will honor him him I believe him more say you understand me and I said there is nobody that preached this word as close to this word of God as that M this message so if this message go to see us through we have to stand by it we have to make it the absolute and everywhere we go we must go with a message to let people know that Christ is is rising he is not dead and how would they know that his reison is Not Dead by our life by our testimony by the way we perceive everybody uh around the home yes and uh we leave to testify in the place of walk among our friends among our people let us go tell with a worthy life that Christ is alive he's not dead may the Lord bless you as I hand over the propy to the pastor I want to say thank you once again please keep me in your prayers I'm truly recovering I'm getting better by the day and I know I'm going to be fully better a but I'm getting stronger but I rely on your prayers I rely on your friendship I love your church I love this envir environment I love you people uh many of you I know many I'm getting to know but I believe that the Lord T is coming we continue to see but the Lord decide to call us I told my children I'm not afraid to die though I pleaded with the Lord that please give me more 20 or 30 years to spend but it's in the will of the Lord that's our desire but the Lord owns it but if he call us today where will you make Christ so that's why we must leave as if he's coming tomorrow but said plan your life as if will not come 10 years but live the life as if he coming tomorrow so may the Lord bless you all God bless you I love you all bless come thank you thank you amen amen we want to thank God for our brother like I said he's a brother and friend someone that is very dear to us very very dear to us those years when we were traveling traveling some of our missionary trips around West Africa brother sha was a very very big support to us very very big support to us and uh he and his family so we want to thank the Lord for our brother we pray that the Lord will

love you father in your wonderful name we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen the Lord bless you thank you musicians and uh uh that will be it for the music let's just stand this morning take our Bibles to Revelation chapter 1 Revelation chapter 1 praise the Lord Revelation chapter 1 I I I just want to bring a little thought to you this morning that I entitled The Bleeding word I entitled it the bleeding word and where I'm taking this from we living in U in an age where you hear this thing you know the blood of Jesus I cover my house with the blood I wash myself in the blood I bath I cover my family with the blood we want to look at the blood this morning amen all the blood of Jesus it washes white as snow are we together Revelation chapter 1 Revelation chapter 1 let's read from verse four just to get a background here we want to look at the blood and our our access to the blood what actually is the blood Revelation chapter 1 reading from verse 4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you you in peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne praise the Lord and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten from the dead and the prince of the Kings of the earth unto him that love us and wash us from our sins in his own blood praise the Lord unto him that love us and wash us from our sins in his own blood and have made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever and the church says amen amen father we have read your word we'll be reading more portion of your word Lord but we want to ask the blessings now for speaking and for hearing help us Lord Jesus in your wonderful name we pray amen amen while you sit in your seat let's turn to Ephesian chapter 5 Ephesians chapter to 5 praise the Lord Ephesian chapter 5 Ephesians chapter 5 let's read from verse 21 just for the background submitting yourself one to another in the fear of God praise the Lord submitting yourself one to another in the fear of God wife submit yourself unto your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wife be to her own husband in everything husband love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the watching of the Water by the word now that's what I was coming to here uh but I just had to use that for the background because Paul kind of for tied these things to Christ giving himself and the reason why he gave himself that he might stify and cleanse the church with the watching of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blameless amen praise the Lord are we together amen so do you believe this morning that you are blameless if you are in this church you are blameless you believe that amen do you struggle with that in your mind the difference here is that you are blameless but you are not sinless okay okay there's a difference as we approach the word you will see it because I know that uh the word says here he will present the church with our spot wrinkle that you will be blameless you are blameless but we are not sinless may God add blessing to the reading of his word praise the Lord amen you love the Lord amen you ready for the word amen so just like I said we want to look at this subject we living in in in such an age where we we have all of these uh uh the the the chastic movement that have that that is birthed out of the Pentecostal movement the caram movement is actually an impersonation of the original Pentecostal movement why I say that is because the Pentecostal movement was uh the move of God you know when God move uh uh and then uh uh uh on Aza uh the the Pentecostal Revival where the gifts were were birth among the people and uh the people really experienc uh a move of God and uh now the caras movement is trying to repeat what happened uh uh what happened back there uh uh in the zza street they're trying to they're trying to you know repeat that or impersonate that that's what makes you know uh the movement what it is but it has also influenced the church in such a way that uh we have all of these praying groups and all of these you know uh end time profets and all of these uh you know different movement that we having you know what is also dangerous about that is that we are having a bunch of illegitimate churches when I say illegitimate is not in the wrong way just follow me is because uh an an an illegitimate child is not does not know their father so we have a lot of churches that cannot Trace themselves to their origin praise the Lord am it's because you know I you know I'm not satisfied with what it's happening here I go and start my church but I don't have no reference every church that is a denomination came from somewhere praise the Lord the Lutheran Church birth out of the the the Luther Revival the Methodist westem Church they all birth out of uh uh John Wesley Revival Baptist came out of John Smith Revival Nazar and all of them John Kimber and all of these guys that's where all of these churches birth from but never never a time in the history of the world where we have a a bunch of more than 1 million plus different churches that don't know where they came from amen amen they are just birth from one disagreement praise the Lord but it's the spirit of the age that's not what I want that's not what I'm I'm I'm preaching on I I've been trying to put some things together and and and uh to be able to show uh uh you know Church historical facts of uh all of where all of these churches are B from the men that started this revival uh uh the minites came from uh uh minor Simon and he started the miniz church and and and in order of there praise the Lord but this morning we want to look at the bleeding word the bleeding word the bleeding word I call it the bleeding word the one because uh we sing that son is dripping with blood is dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood praise the Lord the blood of the disciples that died for the truth amen so it's a bleeding gospel it's a bleeding gospel uh uh my redeemer live it don't you don't you love him we s that uh little some because we believe the Holy G gospel is dripping with blood uh it is a way of persecution it's a way of misunderstanding that's right the word don't know it the word never knew it the word will hit you but be of a good cheer I have overcome the word amen they don't understand understand it they don't understand it that was one thing that Jesus said to Nicodemus except a man be born again he shall not see the kingdom of God meaning he will never understand the principle of what God is doing it is not by joining the church it's not by reading the all the credentials of the church what is required of us is the new birth without the new birth you will never understand God's purpose for your life you will never understand how God is dealing with you why he's allowing you to go through the different things that you are going through we will never understand it praise the Lord because you will not be patient with God you will not be patient with yourself you turn back right to the action of Adam and Eve to find somebody to blame for your problem right and that's the reason why the new birth is important is not joining church it's not residing creef it's a birth just like when a child is born and that was the thing that that that that that troubled Nicodemus when Jesus talk about a new birth because he knows a birth is to come out of something so he said do I need to go back into my mother's womb and that's what many people are doing going back into their old system right and there is no way you can go back either are we together Jesus says you have to be born again because what is born of the flesh is of flesh but what is born of the spirit is of spirit and that's the only way we can be able to understand what God is uh is dealing with our life praise the Lord are we together praise the Lord you just think about this you read the book of Job one of the oldest book of the Bible his voice of of mind is still bad taking medication for that actually thing in mind so he just making my whole throat dry but I'm getting better amen I'm getting better and uh yeah you read the book of job as the oldest book of the Bible and you find that uh uh job is caught into a trial that he didn't know the Bible set a scene very well to let us to know that uh uh Satan was bragging on job that there is no man on the earth and and and Satan was uh bragging on job telling the devil there is nothing you can do to this man that will make me to curse make him to curse me amen job never knew about it it would have been so easy for job if he knew what was going on on and that is the same way with you and myself lot of the things that we go through we don't know what is we think we know what is happening we we like to make ourself believe that we know what is happening right praise the Lord but uh we don't know what is happening if we if we believe that our life is in the hands of God then we must believe that he has a plan that is far beyond what we can think about amen praise Lord so you go the The Book of Job brings us a a complete drama of how little we know of what we are dealing with and we go through all all the turo and all the struggle just at the end for God to help job to seiz that this is something that was written from the foundation of the word where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy and their names were put on the L Book of Life so so yeah so we want to look at the we want to look at this subject this morning about the the bleeding word we want to talk more about the blood oh the blood of Jesus Amen oh the blood of Jesus it wases white as snow Hallelujah I I I will read something yet and I will give you the background of Faith this is from the fourth seal and uh the mysterious rather watch what he does now OPP pause refuse to repent and to go back to the original blood word the word become blood and flesh now that's where I'm taking my inspiration from you see because the early church when Jesus introduced the communion to the Ed Church to the disciples and he says take this bread he blessed it broke it take this bread eat this is my flesh amen do it in remembrance of me take this cup he bless the wine he give it to them drink this is my blood of the New Covenant do this in remembrance of me the disciple did it they kept it in the book of Acts the Bible say they went from house to house breaking bread and and all to the disciples the early church when they did that when they had communion it was a way of remembering the Lord amen it was a way of remembering the suffering he went through it was a way of remembering the price that he paid but when calm took over the church amen they changed the formula to give the church The Authority they changed the formula and they make the church to believe that the bread is not a representation the bread is the literal body so the dogma of Catholicism is the the priest has the power to change their little whff to the body of Jesus he has the power to change the wine to the literal blood of Jesus now follow me a little bit that is the reason why the church draws the people because if if the priest have the lital blood and he has the Lal body of Jesus and you can trust him to tell him of everything that you are doing yeah amen and he can tell you that you are forgiven your sin is Forgiven it's a very strong Dogma it's a very very strong docma if a man has the power to change this water as I'm holding this water in my hands and I pray over it right now it turned to the tears of Jesus I'm trying to grab you to something amen if a man have the power to do that why more can he not do right praise the Lord amen why more can he not do so you see the church capture the people that's the reason why they put the authority in the church and not in the word in the word the bread and the blood is just a representation right right it's not literal it's just representing that's what the Bible says but the church said no we have the power to change it from being L to be the actual right praise the Lord so if you can have the if you can have access to the actual blood and body of Jesus every Sunday you come to church you tell the priest I just told I lied I I I slept I commit adultery you come he says okay my son my the Lord be with you the Lord bless you and he gave it to you and he says your sin is Forgiven amen if you have that Avenue to to to take the lital blood and be cleansed every Sunday won you go be cleansed every Sunday the rest of the week you can live any way you want to live you can you can drink you can live any life suay just go stay behind that little bus tell the priest this is what I have done praise the Lord there is no power of regeneration right there is nothing to change you right you can never get out of your habits you can never be delivered M what is the need of being delivered praise the Lord and I just don't want to go into it but uh uh uh the church has committed a lot of atrocities on De yeah on that that power of changing a wher to the actual body of Jesus and the wine to the blood of Jesus if a man can do that then you can never see no wrong in that man if he has the power to change that then what wrong can he do do you see why the the the church has allowed its leaders to go with our question questioning them what wrong can he do then are we together am but we just read in Revelation chapter 15 Jesus the Bible says I will come back to that I just want to set uh I just want to set a place here because uh uh uh if we don't if we don't pay attention we find ourself under under the influence of our age doing the same thing that the you know the religious spirit of our age is doing and we think that we are in in in line with God's word so just like I said you have this uh saying all over the place you know I I wash myself in the blood of Jesus you know uh uh you know I was talking to someone and uh you know they were sharing you know somebody was giving them you know some you know some advice some spiritual advice you know Prophet it and say this thing that is happening to you you know you got to you got to you need to really concentrate yourself you need to you so go and byy a drink uh is a is a kind of for Rik drink a GP like drink uh uh vento go and buy vento is the blood of Jesus putting the water pray over it by vent pray over it that's the same thing that the priest is doing right when you pray over it it tend to the blood of Jesus then you pull it inside your behaving water that's that's being ritualistic right it's not scriptural right it's not scriptural now let me let me grab your attention when Jesus said take this my blood he had not shared his blood yet it was just before his blood was shared amen so if he actually needed the church to get his literal blood he would say Peter James and John I will be crucified you take buckets when I nail on the cross I'm not I'm not playing fun I want you to grab what I'm going if I'm nail on the cross you'll put those buckets under the cross because you will need the blood right if he if he want us to have his lital blood yes right he will have have told him he will not take h h h uh wine and says this is my blood right he's saying this is my blood in the sense of representation right praise the lord it's in the sense of representation the reason is because the L of blood was not what was needed right are we together even when we go over to the the Old Testament where the Bible would tell us of why the the the Old Testament Saints were keeping the blood sacred it was not because of the literal chemical blood it was because of the life that was in the blood praise the Lord let me help you another word again if I need blood transfusion they will not just take any blood no every blood is good but they will not take why do they look for blood type is because it's a Lifeline right praise the Lord Brother brother Jordan is back there he's the chemist he's the man that is always testing looking at blood and all of that is because it's a bloodline it has a life there's a life in that blood that will help me if my blood type is not good as yours or is it cannot be compatible to yours they will not give it even though my blood is not bad right are you getting the picture so it is not just the blood it's the life that is in the blood without the life the blood God is useless that's right praise the Lord amen and that is the reason why also when we are sick and after the doctor you have told the doctor everything my head is hurting and and sometime I feed it on this side and and and this other side and you finish saying everything he sitting down there he's listening to you then he send those uh those uh uh how do they call them they com in those guys with the needles that can suck blood they come and poke you and pull some blood why are they doing it they want to go and look at your life it read the blood amen they go and look at your life they go and read your book they are reading your book of life right are you see are you getting the picture so the blood is not is not all about the chemical right what makes the blood valuable is the life amen that is in the blood are we together that's the reason why even with people that donate blood and and all of that when those Bloods are are being donated they extract them quickly and put it to a place where they can preserve it because it has to be a living blood they just don't set it down there for for 2 three hours then they take it and go and put it in somebody it's a dead blood right they take it quickly they go and preserve it because what they want is the life without the life in the blood is just another color water are we together are you seeing the picture amen so you see okay I I wanted to read something here to you before I move further and uh you love the Lord amen I sure you do or else you won't be here this morning praise the Lord Exodus chapter 17:1 the Bible says for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for the soul the life of the flesh is in the blood praise the Lord yeah that it looks like I'm becoming the doctor this morning but uh uh uh when your blood is reduc reducing they can tellar from the poorness of your flesh they tell from the filling of your flesh that this person needs to build their blood count because the life of the flesh is in the blood are we together now so uh it makes it easier for me when I can grab your attention then we can be able to seal in this thought because uh uh when you look at uh uh the scriptural pattern the blood in the Old Testament was used as a substitutionary word for the worshipper to approach God praise the Lord amen they will come and you know uh uh uh sacrifice an animal confess their sin and all of that and uh and the priests will pray for them they would go but the scripture tells us that uh uh the life of the animal could never come back on the worshipper praise the Lord the life that was in the blood of that animal could never come back on the worshipper because the animal do not have a soul even though now they have done the first they have done the first uh uh uh how do they call it a kind of a blending genetic surgery where they took the kidney of an animal and they use it in the Hoban praise the Lord it saved your life don't don't don't shake your your head it save the person's life uh they use the kidney of a of a peak and uh they did a transplant that that's the first one Medical Science has ever done and it was successful they are watching to see how the person will will progress are we together amen and uh I I don't this is not all part of my message I don't know where I'm going with all days but I'm just trying to bring us to the place where we can be able to realize that it was all when men fell when Adam and he fell in the Garden of Eden they fell from a life amen are we together they fell from a life because God said the day you eat this that day you will die so they fell from a life and here we are we are finding through the scripture that the life is in the blood amen so God creating a substitute to bring man back to the life that he has fell from give man the way of the blood God provided it was God provided way God uh uh uh way of substitute to be able to bring men back into Fellowship right so he gave man a sacrificial order but realize when they were sacrificing they had to Spill the blood of the animal but what God was looking at was the life praise the Lord now that is the reason why in the Old Testament worship also the animal that was sacrificed was not just any kind right it had to be examined praise the Lord it had to be examined all of that was God's targeting the life are we together are you beginning to see the picture now so uh uh right through right through time you will see there all through the scripture that the Bible uses light word washing cleansing blood the scripture use it in a uh in in a connecting way and it's all to be able to give us a picture of what of what God was trying to achieve Jesus says the words that I speak unto you you they alive in spirit he first told them you are cleansed by these words that I speak unto you David said your word is a light onto my path so there is there is there is this connection and even before we go further there you know you see there in first John in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the same that lighted every man that cometh into the word so word light there is always that connection are we together amen so let's go back again to uh Revelation chapter 1 let's go back to Revelation chapter 1 get into what a lot of uh I will miss the thing I want to get to verse 5 we read earlier and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first begotten from the dead the prince all the kings of the earth unto him that love us and watch us from our sins in his own blood when did he do that now you have to realize now this Revelation is is is is after Jesus eff Ministry okay after Jesus eely ministry join on the Outland of pmos Jesus is now H uh revealing himself to John and talking about the work that he's going to do in the future ages and here he's introducing himself to John and he says I'm the faithful and true witness the the first the first begotten from the dead now so the first begotten from the dead speaks of the Resurrection amen I'm the first begotten from the dead which mean I've already resurrected I have ascended on high now I have come in the form of the Holy Spirit are we together first begard him from the dead the prince of the kings of the earth and unto him that love us and wash us from our sin in his own blood so this is after the resurrection and the Ascension and now he's watching us in his blood where is the blood praise the Lord what is the blood that he's watching us in are we together what what I'm trying to do here for us uh H as a people is to be able to understand there the when we say sir I rebuke you by the blood of Jesus Christ many times our mind goes back to Calvary this is after Calvary Jesus is watching us in his blood after Calvary yes after he have uh uh extended and he has come back to the church in the form of the holy spirit so we have to now identify by scripture are we together amen now this is John writing here 1 John chapter one let's go back to John 1 John chapter 1 we we pick that up in our beginning series 1 John chapter 1 are we together 1 John chapter 1 let's look at verse 6 if we say that we have fellowship with him Jesus and walk in darkness we lied and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin praise the Lord this is also after Calvary so you see what is happening here now our walking in the light connect us to Calvary you don't have the benefit of Calvary if you are not walking in the light right you are not connected to Calvary if we are not walking in the light he watch us from all of our sins and here John is saying and and and and and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all of our sin how does that happen when are we watched when are we being cleansed are we together so you see the thing about a church is that Jesus just did not left a slogan with his church right that just oh the blood of Jesus all the blood of Jesus what is the blood of Jesus what is that blood even many times Serv is out of fear that we are shouting all over the place the blood of Jesus Amen now take take this example there in Egypt Goan the the night before the exodor the children of Israel were supposed to kill the lamb take the blood take a house up and put the blood on the LED of the door post amen are we together there was a a a direct instruction that was given to them they didn't say paint your whole door red no no put the blood on the LED of the door post that was the instruction yeah so if if a person if a parent is afraid of the death iner and takes the lme blood and just was it on the door is not going to help you right because you are not following their instruction the instruction was to put the blood on the door of the Len tail when I see the blood I will pass over you yeah praise the Lord so even when we apply the blood of Jesus there is an instruction of how to apply the blood you want to apply the blood to your family you want to apply the blood there is an instruction in the word how to imp apply the blood are we together praise the Lord are you seeing the picture it said becoming clearer to you amen so you see our our connection to Calvary I mean you can travel and go to Jerusalem and it take you on on on the mountain and you can stand there and and and but if you are not walking in the light you are not connected to calary you can never get the benefit of the blood because here John is saying h h h uh if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another then we have access to the blood are we together and what is this light your word is a light unto my path so the word of God for every age brings the provision of the blood for that age amen the word of God for every age you can create your own religious approach your 12 Day step your 20day step fast and pray drive fast hot fast wet F whatever you want to do right but God has an instruction look at what he did in the Garden of Eden when he came down to restore Adam and Eve back to fellowship he took a lamb slay a lamb on the east side of Eden and the Bible says he robbed them Adam Adam took was hiding himself with a fake Leaf he took some kind of a Le to hide himself that could not please God right amen if they will ever be in fellowship with God God had to draw them and he he had to dress them amen and he wrapped them in a bleeding skin a lime skin that was bleeding and that was how he sent them out of the Garden of Eden because what God will trace the step of every dripping blood to find where his children has gone praise the lord it's not just a slogan that's that's that's what I want for us to see if Jesus said this take this my blood it's the blood of the New Covenant let's look at what Paul says in Hebrew quickly try to find a place here to send you home Hebrews chapter 13 are we together am Hebrews chapter 313 verse 20 Hebrews chapter 13 now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting coover him amen follow the reading closely follow the reading now now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus brought Jesus from the dead are we together he's the great Shepherd of the sheep brought Jesus from the dead through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant what was the blood of the Everlasting Covenant was it the one he Shar on the cross no it was the one that Jesus gave to the church this is my blood take it for the new and Everlasting Covenant so what is Paul saying here Paul is saying that uh God brought Jesus from the dead by the Covenant that he that he Jesus made with the church and what they what which Covenant that he made with the church what was he giving them he was giving them the word yeah so in one sense Paul is trying to say that the the word the word this word of God has more value before God than even the Lal blood why because the word is the life there will be no need to have a Bible if this is not the word of God and if God's word is not life right are we together amen I'm saying all of this to be able to help us to to see the place where uh uh you know the church has put us because we can disregard the word of God we can disrespect the word of God and yet we can still clean the blood I cover my family with the blood when we are disregarding what God's word says right praise the Lord amen when we are disrespecting the word we are dishonoring the word you see that is the reason why the church holds its place when a man is not living according to the standard of the word he must not partake of communion why because you cannot be disregarding the word and you you're also part of the ordinance it does not work the church take these things as a slogan the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood I plead the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood right and if we can say it fast and we can say it loud then we think we have the we have the effect we have the benefit of it praise the Lord if we have the lital blood here where we pass it from row to row we all drink the lital blood if God not be merciful we we will get terminate illness right because when Jesus shared his blood on the cross of Calvary his life came back on the DAT of Pentecost as the Holy Ghost the life that was in the blood came back to do what to honor the word that joah said I will pour my spirit upon your sons and daughters so the life came on the word without the word you don't have the blood right you can stay with your your slogan and stay with your uh uh your slank but without the word you don't have the blood that is as much as we can see in the scripture how is he watching us because that's what Paul says there in in Ephesian Christ gave himself for the church just uh uh so he can sanctify it and cleanse it by the watching of the Water by the word so he watched Us in his blood by his word when we say Amen to the word when we receive the word when we submit to the word yes sir then that's when we get the watching that's when the word cleanses us not just by saying the blood I wash my whole family in the blood I bathe my children in the blood and then we have we don't have one regard for the word of God right are we together just get a few minutes here and I'll let you go invisible Union think your garment watch by the water of the bleeding word the word becomes blood the word becomes blood let me show you another Old Testament type that you will appreciate when Joseph was in praising amen you remember that there were two praising us with him one was a baker and the other one was a cup Bearer are we together praise the Lord and the both men had dreams the baker had a dream he baked some bread and and then the birds were eating eating over his head yeah the the cup Bearer also had dream and then he was uh he was serving back uh his master and Joseph will interpret the dream he will interpret the dream that the the cup Bearer will return back to his work he will be saved but the the baker will die are we together and you see a perfect type of Jesus not only with Jesus having two teeths on the cross praise the Lord but Jesus said the bread represent what what did he said take this bread it represent what my body because his body would die sure he said take this bread it represent my body because his body will die right and what will benefit the church is the blood the cup Bearer The Life which comes back on the believer are we together it's not just the two men but even the elements and that that is the thing that shows us the importance of communion in a local church right I'm making that emphasis because we are coming to one praise the Lord are you seeing the picture your gu may watch by water of the bleeding word the word becomes blood the word bled for you and you are watched in the bleeding word it was the word that bled for you why was that word a virgin shall [Music] conceive th word that Isaiah spoke th word that all the Prophet spoke when bam said I see a star out of Jacob that word was what bled for you yes the church keep our eyes on the man Jesus and that's the reason why it's hard for us to believe that he's here it's easy for us to look back to 2,000 years ago and it's difficult for us to honor that he's [Music] here praise the Lord because to God his word was more value than the Flesh of Jesus then the body are we together let me read this so we can find a place to close here the word becomes blood the word bled for you and you are watched in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be watched from the filth of this prostitute and be clean and Sanctified by the watching of the water that makes your mind mind and your heart stay on God and on the word until we take God's word serious in our life will'll be far away from regeneration we'll be very far from regeneration until we take God word serious and not just church membership how long I've been in the church or how long I I've been serving God that does not matter to God it does not bring the life back on the worshipper the scripture said the the worshipper wants PCH praise the Lord amen yes the bleeding word and every time the word is preached to you the word is bleeding every time it's preached to you because it's just like when the Old Testament sints went to the Tabernacle they had the sprinkling of of of the red haer the sacrifice that was that was uh that was uh that was killed for the people when they confessed their sins the arches of the sacrifice was put into a water and that water was sprinkled on the people they used the water to sprinkle on the people and what it was signifying is that the life of this de dead animal was the one that's two between you and God right it's because this animal give his life that's the reason why you have a right to live but now we don't have an animal we have God himself that took on flesh came and give his life so every time we sit under the preaching of the word is the sprinkling of the blood what are you doing with it you have the blood of Jesus on Your Hands yes every time you listen to truth from God's word you have the blood of Jesus on Your Hands that's the reason why it does not benefit me to give you my my my idea or my opinion it must come from the word if it is not the word I don't have nothing to say praise the Lord Jesus said things that are to be be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and it is a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand before and be married to a perfect Son of God you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything as but the perfect word of God Amen so that's the place that's where I come to say that uh you are blameless we are not sinless right this the gospel is not to Pro produce uh uh sinless Perfection no but we are blameless yeah it's common it's easy to understand praise the Lord you bought a shirt a white shirt you wore it and you bring bring it back for watching it have some steain on it you wash it you put it in the bleach you bring it out it's clean but it's not new right it's clean but it's not new praise the Lord so don't fall and carry back to the store don't return it it's clean but it's not new right that is the principle of sinless and blameless but by our birth we were born in sin ship in iniquity amen by our Birth by our first birth we were all born in sin we are honor that Lord of Sinner saved by grace yes but when we submit ourself to the word of God when we come to the Fountain Dream from Emmanuel V when we come to the fountain that is in the House of David that Zachariah said is for every uncleanness and we submit ourself to God and say Lord yeah I am I'm I'm I'm a wretched sinner my mind is dead in my heart my desire are filthy cleanse me and we can have the courage to take God by his word that if we confess our sin he's faithful and just to forgive us hallelujah what you doing you just dropping yourself in the bleach praise the Lord praise the Lord you just drop put yourself in the bleach and you bringing yourself out putting yourself in the word using the word to your situation not your smartness right it will not help you it did not help you in the beginning if it could help you you don't need to be here right praise the Lord so how we going to be perfect Jesus said be perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect the Perfection is not our self-righteousness no we are looking at a perfect word I'm looking at a word that can correct me when I need correction I'm looking at a word word that I can go to for an answer when I need it it's a perfect word praise the Lord the clock has take 1:00 try to leave you here we'll pick that up I almost forget be gone uh in the middle of the week I be doing some meetings for Brother Bill Young in Tennessee Wednesday Thursday and Friday and I'll be back on Saturday so keep me in prayers please that almost slipped my mind so just keep me in prayers we'll be out uh doing some meetings in the week and then uh be back on Saturday for service so just pray for me let's just read this together and then we find a place here to close uh brother Dan will speak for us on Wednesday night so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the water of Separation that wash us from our sins amen is that word standing between you and God right is the word that is standing between you and God he looking at you through his word yeah are you embracing it or are you rejecting it your attitude to the word of God is your attitude to the blood that was Shar for you praise the Lorden you cannot use the blood of Jesus Christ to condemn another sinner it's not the blood that calls for vengeance just like the blood of Abe that cry out of the Earth this blood cry for forgiveness say father forgive them they don't know what they are doing if you are under this blood that will be your language your language will not be Vengeance your language will not be swearing and thinking that evil should happen to the person right then you are not connected to the blood yet musicians you can come we'll continue another day before I take all of your beautiful there it's beautiful out there amen amen it's beautiful out there let me leave you so we can go enjoy the beautiful day but let's walk in the light as he is in the light amen praise the Lord nothing but the blood of Jesus let's just sing that together before we pray nothing but the blood of Jesus

in the of Hallelujah Hallelujah hey amen amen amen praise the Lord let's just bow our heads now and and we can pray together and uh I just had this thought of my mind to share with you this morning to see the benefit that we have whenever you read the word whenever you are reading the word with concentration you read the word you are applying the token you are applying the token that's that's the reason why don't read the word to see somebody else or read the word to condemn someone else read the word to apply that talking to yourself yes sir read it to apply the token is the applying of the
