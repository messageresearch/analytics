[2:17] for the next area or so - Farah we are
[2:20] so going to look at our topic on tithing
[2:24] way prettier Lord Jesus just come and
[2:27] help us further in the few things we
[2:30] have to say we just thank you so much
[2:34] Father in Jesus name Amen
[2:40] praise be to God
[2:42] yes so I just have maybe 10 minutes to
[2:52] talk about this then are we invited
[2:54] brother Scott the very day I started
[2:58] this topic since Naomi told me that
[3:04] where Scott has a wonderful testimony
[3:06] about tithing so I said okay that is
[3:10] good to know so I had that at the back
[3:13] of my mind and I have been waiting for
[3:16] the opportunity to get brother Scott to
[3:20] come over and he and I spoke last two
[3:23] weeks and as God would have it he'll be
[3:28] talking to us this morning so 15 minutes
[3:33] to the end of our time I'm going to call
[3:35] him so I just have probably just about
[3:37] 10 minutes so bear with me this morning
[3:39] and I've been talking to this just by
[3:44] way of an announcement so if I go over
[3:47] my time a little just bear with me
[3:51] because that is not part of my our our
[3:55] our our our Sunday school I've been
[4:01] talking to brother 1 and now he wants us
[4:05] to stop playing the tips by the end
[4:08] first week of March unless something
[4:13] changes I think that is what we'll be
[4:18] doing we still have a few things to talk
[4:21] about that so
[4:25] I would have to bring this one end
[4:27] somehow before then so we can go into
[4:34] the tapes praise be to God
[4:36] so just we're reading shall we take
[4:39] again Malachi 3 alright so Malachi 3:10
[5:01] bring you all the tithes into the
[5:03] storehouse that there may be meat in
[5:06] mine house and prove me now herewith
[5:08] saith the Lord of Hosts if I will not
[5:11] open to you if I will not open you the
[5:15] windows of heaven and pour you out a
[5:18] blessing that there shall be not there
[5:23] shall not be room enough to receive it
[5:27] praise be to God
[5:28] yes so what I have here for the next few
[5:34] minutes I want us to look at why do we
[5:37] pay tithes why do we pay tithe and what
[5:43] I have here is that we pay twice because
[5:48] God is so you know it's a wonderful
[5:52] thing when you do the will of God
[5:57] without questioning it it's a wonderful
[6:02] thing that sometimes you don't
[6:05] understand what the Word of God says
[6:10] before the fact that you know it is the
[6:13] Word of God
[6:14] you go ahead and you do it anyhow we
[6:22] serve God by faith we don't serve God by
[6:26] comprehension don't wait to understand
[6:32] before you give you all to God you
[6:35] whatever field it is do it by feet
[6:42] because it is the word of God and was
[6:44] this soon at any given point in time
[6:49] even were to receive your healing when
[6:53] you are prayed for if the pain level was
[6:57] probably troopers arm normally they say
[7:01] maybe one to over ten and then after we
[7:05] are being prayed for the plane moves
[7:07] from two over ten to ten over ten still
[7:10] Tongo that you are healed why it's not
[7:14] because you are feeling good or you are
[7:15] feeling better but because the Word of
[7:18] God says so God is on it in that praise
[7:22] be to God
[7:22] so we pair ties because the Word of God
[7:25] and joins us to pay ties we observe it
[7:29] as an ordinance as a lot of God we don't
[7:33] have to understand it praise be to God
[7:37] so that is the first reason I have here
[7:41] and then secondly we pay our ties to
[7:47] support the church praise be to God so
[7:55] we don't just support the church with
[7:58] our presence
[8:00] we support the church with our presence
[8:04] and with our tyson offering so it's not
[8:10] okay to sit in the house and then let
[8:14] your tighten offerings come and it's not
[8:17] okay also to come to church and not pay
[8:22] your tithe and offering the two go
[8:25] hand-in-hand
[8:26] that is the way we support the work of
[8:29] god that is the way to go now in the
[8:34] message let us see God paragraph 28 1958
[8:43] 59 but you know I feel like this that a
[8:48] member of a
[8:50] the our first obligation is with their
[8:53] tithes and offerings is to support their
[8:57] church does your first duty to God
[9:01] bring your tight and offering to the
[9:04] storehouse of God and the storehouse you
[9:08] surely know what this is is where you
[9:12] get your food so that's where you get
[9:15] your spiritual food and your obligation
[9:20] is to your church praise be to God so to
[9:27] support the work of God to support the
[9:31] Church of the Living God you have to pay
[9:35] your tithes and your friends what I have
[9:39] here is number three takes it's not our
[9:46] money
[9:46] it's God's money so by paying tides you
[9:53] are giving god what belongs to him
[9:57] you know when you keep something that
[10:00] doesn't belong to you in essence you
[10:03] have stolen it the Bible says in Malachi
[10:09] 3:8 if I can just take it in a minute
[10:14] will a man Rob God yet you have robbed
[10:19] me but ye say wherein have we robbed
[10:23] thee in types and offering in tithes and
[10:29] offering we robbed God so when you pay
[10:34] your tithes you are just carrying
[10:38] something that doesn't belong to you you
[10:42] are just current something that we
[10:43] launched to God you have just carried it
[10:46] as an obligation as a duty knowing that
[10:48] is not mine it belongs to God so I'm
[10:51] giving it to God
[10:53] praise be to God so that is another
[10:58] reason why we have to pay tithes
[11:02] and there is a place to pay your tithes
[11:05] one day we came to church after church
[11:08] now I've told me her friend had a baby
[11:11] naming ceremony and they had it in the
[11:13] church so we went there and then they
[11:17] were talking about tithing and somebody
[11:20] asked a question no it was a
[11:21] contribution the fellow gave and the
[11:23] fellow said that he was not paying his
[11:27] tied to the church or to the pasta
[11:30] because the pastas misuse the ties and
[11:36] what I view in the first place your
[11:40] obligation or your duty is to pay your
[11:42] tie to God which ever wear the tightest
[11:46] used is not your concern
[11:48] it's not your cup of tea that is another
[11:52] topic praise be to God so and this was
[11:56] what the gentleman was saying and then
[11:58] he said to pay his tight he goes he
[12:01] carried the money and then gives it to
[12:03] the poor
[12:05] it's a good thing to help the poor if
[12:11] you are in a position to do it
[12:14] do not use God's money to do good it's
[12:20] good to do good don't use God's money to
[12:26] win do good God's money belongs to the
[12:29] house of God and you are saying because
[12:36] of that he can still remain he gives it
[12:38] to the poor no that is no way we are
[12:45] being instructed to pay that money or to
[12:48] put that money that is wrong that money
[12:56] belongs in the house of God that is why
[13:00] you get your deliberate man shall not
[13:04] live by bread alone but by every way
[13:06] that pushes our mouth of God you don't
[13:08] get your bread from the poor person day
[13:11] as I've said if you had a position to
[13:14] help the poor do it it's a good
[13:16] there is a blessing in that God loves to
[13:19] see that but I don't take the money that
[13:21] belongs to God and then go out there and
[13:25] then give it to somebody and think you
[13:27] did something good it's very bad very
[13:29] wrong something she didn't do praise be
[13:31] to God why do we pay tight okay so it's
[13:42] right where I want the time to be yes so
[13:52] whereas God is going to share with us
[13:54] whatever God has laid on his hatch and
[13:58] yes open your ears tap into it James
[14:05] don't happen by chance
[14:06] praise be to God relevant good morning
[14:15] Saints first of all bill Danna was I'm
[14:20] thinking about that sir when you're
[14:21] preach about you know finding God's
[14:23] purpose for your life and it reminded me
[14:26] in the scripture if he is one of my
[14:27] favorites not my my real favorite
[14:31] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 where it
[14:35] says for we are his workmanship created
[14:38] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[14:40] God hath before ordained that we should
[14:43] walk in them that God has for Deen each
[14:48] and every one of us amen
[14:50] forward Amy for the foundation of the
[14:52] world that he wants to walk in your
[14:55] shoes he wants to use your lips that
[14:58] fact he wants you he wants he wants us
[15:01] just get out of the way and let him do
[15:02] as he pleases and then he turns around
[15:05] and and calls us a good and faithful
[15:07] servant for just letting him do what he
[15:10] desire to do through us so I kind of
[15:12] like that program amen so this morning
[15:16] you know Naomi came up to me and she
[15:19] said I'll pray for you this morning I've
[15:21] been praying for ya while she's praying
[15:23] for me because she wants me to come up
[15:25] and tell her myself
[15:26] that's why
[15:28] that's the testimony so but just as
[15:32] brother Dan was sharing a few things it
[15:35] just made me smile you know when I was a
[15:36] little boy I have two older brothers and
[15:38] three younger brothers and when we were
[15:41] just little fallows my mom being a godly
[15:44] woman we'd go to church and she'd give
[15:47] us each a dime and then we were supposed
[15:49] to put that in the offering plate just
[15:51] teaching us early on you know how to you
[15:54] know to be mindful of being a good
[15:58] steward of God's God's money and of
[16:00] course it was very clear to us it wasn't
[16:02] our money and that was for a specific
[16:03] purpose that we weren't supposed to just
[16:06] put it in our pocket and go to the go to
[16:08] the candy store and of course back at
[16:10] that time $0.10 Josh ma says you could
[16:13] buy a whole bag full of candy for about
[16:15] ten cents you get a penny candy okay a
[16:17] good candy bars Snickers bar something
[16:19] was only a nickel I could have two if I
[16:22] decided I was going to be tempted about
[16:24] it but but we realized that it wasn't
[16:27] our money to begin with our mom gave it
[16:29] to us and with a specific purpose that
[16:32] it was to train us to be to take that
[16:35] ten cents and put it in the offering
[16:37] plate that it could be used for God's
[16:40] purpose and you know just fast-forward
[16:43] now here I am for almost 60 years later
[16:46] and God still has the same requirement
[16:49] when I was trained instead of 10 cents
[16:51] it's 10% amen i tithe and so it's still
[16:57] the same and I don't have any notes here
[17:01] but and that could be dangerous because
[17:03] no notes I could just be never-ending so
[17:07] you know brother Gerald Hughes he's an
[17:09] old friend of mine and the pastor he's
[17:12] been pastoring church for about Oh
[17:13] probably about 45 years down in near
[17:16] Columbia South Carolina but brother
[17:17] Gerald tells a story I had a little
[17:21] saying he says he says they would be
[17:23] better off if you went and beat up your
[17:26] grandma and stole her purse than to not
[17:28] pay your tithe because you'd only be
[17:31] accused of beating up your grandma and
[17:34] stealing from her but when you don't pay
[17:36] your tithe
[17:36] our brother already mentioned and the
[17:38] scripture says you're actually you
[17:40] stolen from him and as our brother read
[17:43] he said he said if you would pay your
[17:46] ties he would rebuke the Devourer do you
[17:48] know that God if you don't pay your ties
[17:50] yes he has somebody called a devourer
[17:53] that's gonna collect those ties anyway I
[17:56] believe me you'll probably take a lot
[17:58] more than 10% if he has to come and get
[18:00] it from ya so and once it's okay it's
[18:04] kind of humorous to me because because
[18:07] God knows how to get his point across he
[18:10] can eat you know you either give you the
[18:11] ten cents and you put it in the offering
[18:13] plate or he'll make sure he collects it
[18:15] later on your choice so anyway that
[18:20] comes to the story that I need to tell
[18:21] on myself oh it was kind of early in our
[18:25] marriage we were in our and the old
[18:27] church I we are in over it and well at
[18:31] that time we were over in Plymouth and
[18:36] anyway I one time I just decided I just
[18:41] didn't pay my tithe I wasn't upset about
[18:44] anything I wasn't and I wasn't that I
[18:46] didn't believe it here anyway but I just
[18:50] failed to do it and I wasn't upset with
[18:54] the past or anything like that I just
[18:56] didn't write that check out and guess
[18:59] what then the next time I got my
[19:01] paycheck from work I didn't write it out
[19:04] that time and all sudden I wasn't
[19:06] writing out a month went by two months
[19:08] went by three months a year went by and
[19:11] I just didn't pay my tithe I had no
[19:15] reason not to pay it but I just didn't
[19:17] do it and so I don't even remember how
[19:20] long it was but I was at least a year
[19:22] man if we have to Naomi she'll probably
[19:24] tell her she can't tell you exactly what
[19:27] it was I just I just got I just quit
[19:31] paid it and I just did not have a
[19:33] revelation of it and so anyway the
[19:38] pastor had a project that he was working
[19:40] on and so he asked new me to do some
[19:42] seamstress work for him and
[19:47] after it was quite involved and so when
[19:50] she was it when she was done her bill to
[19:55] the pastor was about three hundred
[19:57] dollars I was pretty extensive work and
[19:59] she was a professional seamstress for a
[20:02] high-fashion men's Collier down in south
[20:05] Dale and so she actually went there one
[20:08] of her friends said what would you
[20:09] charge for doing this custom work and
[20:12] she said oh absolutely three hundred
[20:14] dollars would be a you know would be you
[20:16] know a gift probably to the person you
[20:18] know just to pay that much so anyway he
[20:22] wasn't too happy about it and but yet he
[20:24] paid
[20:25] he paid Naomi the three hundred dollars
[20:27] she turned right around he says honey
[20:30] why don't we let's take this money and
[20:32] put it toward tithe and I said let's
[20:39] start paying our tithes and so the
[20:42] scripture says to provoke one another to
[20:44] good works and so just by her decision
[20:47] to you to turn around and just give that
[20:51] money right back where it really
[20:52] belonged it actually you know I repented
[20:56] and I started paying my tithes and not
[20:59] only did I even start paying my tithe
[21:01] paycheck-to-paycheck that I owed as I
[21:05] got a paycheck but I went back and paid
[21:07] every penny of those ties from like I
[21:11] said a year year and a half so I was
[21:13] paying not only was I paying the tithe
[21:15] then I was paying you know current but
[21:19] also go way back and then 20 percent
[21:21] above that so that I got caught back up
[21:28] and I've never had that problem since
[21:31] and so of course now I'm I smile because
[21:33] it's just an absolute amen you know to
[21:36] what what our brothers saying but you
[21:43] know God is good amen I just want to
[21:47] read one scripture if I can find it here
[21:49] oh yeah it says Luke chapter 6 verse 38
[21:55] now you know ties is just that's just
[21:58] the beginning
[21:59] amen I don't know brother Dan's touched
[22:02] on offering but tithe and offering are
[22:04] two different things
[22:06] tithe is what is that is the ten cents
[22:09] that God gave you to put back in the
[22:12] offering plate what you do above and
[22:16] beyond that that's offerings and of
[22:19] course tithe is for the is goes towards
[22:21] the ministry in their work in the
[22:22] ministry and then offerings is for the
[22:24] upkeep and our expenses in the building
[22:26] of course brother Stevie get up and talk
[22:28] all about them but God in the final
[22:33] thing I want to say is as God is the
[22:36] important thing is that it's your
[22:37] attitude and I don't know brother Dan
[22:41] you've probably touched on that already
[22:42] too so if I have forgive me but maybe
[22:45] I'll just punctuate that that God's
[22:47] looking he knows your heart and he knows
[22:49] your attitude if you're just giving it
[22:51] grudgingly well how can God bless
[22:54] something that's just you know I have to
[22:55] pry your finger open to get that 10
[22:58] cents so anyway the scripture Luke 6
[23:03] verse 38 give and it shall be given unto
[23:09] you good measure pressed down and shaken
[23:15] together and running over think about
[23:21] that Saints running over shall men give
[23:26] unto your bosom for with the same
[23:29] measure that ye mete withal it shall be
[23:33] measured to you again you know God has a
[23:38] way of you just give a little and you'll
[23:43] get a lot more back so if you want to
[23:46] make an investment make it an investment
[23:49] in Christ amen if a cup of water given
[23:55] in the name of the disciple that God
[23:57] will recognize even that what about us
[24:01] as believers didn't Jesus say that he he
[24:05] stood there and say they were actually
[24:07] putting their money in the offering
[24:09] basket
[24:10] they all went by and yet the woman who
[24:15] gave the two months no it was the
[24:17] widow's mice she either two mites God
[24:21] said that he had seen her our Jesus said
[24:26] she's given more than any of these other
[24:29] folks so when you do give whether it's
[24:33] your ties whether it's your offering
[24:35] remember God sees it and he'll remember
[24:40] you for that - that's all I got god
[24:53] bless you ready sketch wonderful yes oh
[24:57] yes so five more minutes so that's good
[25:05] yes
[25:07] as he rightly said they're always say we
[25:09] should provoke one another unto good
[25:10] works yes so you know the the woman is
[25:17] there to complain to compliment you as
[25:19] the main you know you complement one
[25:21] another so it's a very very good thing
[25:26] even though the man is the head of the
[25:28] house you were the woman you have you
[25:32] have a voice you know the English versus
[25:40] what the woman is your better half
[25:44] you are you and you are never very good
[25:47] very well until you have you have the
[25:49] half attached so there is a lot of
[25:53] influence that you sisters have don't
[25:58] don't wish to that getting to the very
[26:01] last portions of it brother Scott
[26:03] mentioned attitude the God is looking
[26:07] for attitude I said it here one time ago
[26:11] that your attitude determines your
[26:14] altitude
[26:18] your behavior in your walk with God
[26:21] determines how far you go with God it's
[26:27] very very important keep that at the
[26:30] back of your minds never forget it
[26:34] in any case whatever you give God would
[26:42] be given back to you with a measure so
[26:50] anything given to God is not lost
