[46:36] himself you know and that's what we want
[46:38] to read tonight praise the Lord and uh
[46:43] uh
[46:45] um glory be to God Amen sorry that the
[46:50] tech people is is uh is chapter 7 verse4
[46:54] not 19 I have 19 in my notes so uh uh
[46:58] it's uh 2 Chronicles chapter 7 let's
[47:01] read from verse 13 or from verse 12 ver
[47:05] verse 12 will give us a good setting 2
[47:08] Chronicles chapter 7 from verse 12 and
[47:11] the Lord appeared on to Solomon by night
[47:15] and said unto him I have heard th prayer
[47:18] one thing I noticed last night as I was
[47:20] reading this Solomon had a gift of
[47:24] dreaming praise the Lord amen yes the
[47:27] Lord appearing to him by
[47:30] night when Solomon went before the Lord
[47:33] and uh and says your people are so great
[47:36] the Bible says the Lord appeared to him
[47:39] by night in a dream that I will I will
[47:42] bless you with riches and all of that so
[47:45] I just looking at that part and to me
[47:47] and I feel like he had a gift of uh of
[47:51] of spiritual
[47:52] dreams and the Lord appeared to Solomon
[47:55] by night and said unto him name I have
[47:57] heard that prayer and have chosen this
[48:01] place for myself for an House of
[48:04] sacrifice
[48:06] amen if I shut up Heaven that there be
[48:10] no rain or if I command the Locust to
[48:14] dvo the land or if I send pestilence
[48:18] among my people if my people which I
[48:23] call by my name shall humble themselves
[48:28] and
[48:29] pray and seek my
[48:32] face and turn from their Wicked Ways
[48:37] then will I hear from
[48:40] heaven and will forgive their sins and
[48:44] will heal their land amen amen now if my
[48:49] people which I call by my name like I
[48:51] said this is very familiar to every one
[48:53] of us but I want for us to look at this
[48:55] closely if they shall humble themselves
[48:58] that we try to do amen amen because I
[49:02] will read something to you brother
[49:04] Brandon says it's the Gateway he said
[49:07] it's the
[49:08] Gateway the Lord bless you you can have
[49:10] your seat I'm right to it so let me just
[49:12] start that way if if the if the young
[49:15] people can put uh uh the message humble
[49:17] theirself up let me just read the the
[49:20] the first part as I look into this
[49:22] humble thyself he says uh see the mean
[49:26] thing is love
[49:28] God and humble yourself with it there's
[49:33] a lot of Pride that come with loving God
[49:36] there's a lot of Pride that come with
[49:39] being spiritual but brother Brandon said
[49:41] the main thing is to love God and humble
[49:45] yourself with
[49:46] it praise the Lord amen amen not to feel
[49:50] that we are better than anybody Are we
[49:53] more spiritual than anybody praise the
[49:56] Lord
[49:57] so the main thing is to love
[49:59] God and humble ourself with faith glory
[50:04] be to God not because we are believers
[50:08] there must be nothing that should be
[50:09] difficult for us to do the only
[50:12] difficult thing is that we can go back
[50:13] into the things of the word because God
[50:16] has taken the desire out of
[50:18] Us Praise the Lord am but there should
[50:21] be nothing difficult I mean we should be
[50:23] humble at our workplace humble at home
[50:26] humble with our neighbors the main thing
[50:28] is to love God and to be humble with it
[50:31] listen to what he says later he says now
[50:34] surely after all these years on the
[50:38] field and around the world and seeing
[50:41] different people I ought to
[50:44] know a little bit about the gate to
[50:49] enter
[50:50] in so what is he trying to tell
[50:54] us with all of my EXP experience he said
[50:58] I should know the gate to enter in and
[51:02] the gate to enter in is
[51:06] humbleness the gate you remember that
[51:08] path that we've been talking about that
[51:11] channel the get to enter into that
[51:14] channel is
[51:18] humbleness and that humbleness is not
[51:21] just being
[51:23] quiet you are humbling yourself to every
[51:26] word of God
[51:28] yes praise the Lord now that you can do
[51:32] it but you say Lord your word is true
[51:34] give me Grace yes I surrounder to your
[51:37] word are we together amen I ought to
[51:41] know a little bit about the gate to
[51:44] enter
[51:46] in that's the reason why brother
[51:48] brandham never had complex talking about
[51:50] his
[51:51] life he stand right there to tell the
[51:53] people I'm a seventh grer my father was
[51:56] a
[51:58] drunker and he he tell all of those
[52:01] things what was he trying to do enter
[52:04] into thy
[52:06] gate enter into thy
[52:09] gate so like Solomon said here or the
[52:13] Lord told Solomon If my people that are
[52:15] called by my name shall humble
[52:17] themselves which of course we try to do
[52:19] and
[52:21] pray and seek my face tonight I want to
[52:23] talk about seeking his face what does
[52:26] does that
[52:27] mean so you will see if prayer was
[52:30] seeking God's face the Lord would not
[52:34] tell
[52:35] Solomon if they humble themselves if
[52:37] they pray if they seek my face so
[52:40] seeking his face is something completely
[52:42] different from
[52:45] praying are we together and I will tell
[52:48] you tonight in all of these things that
[52:50] is placed right here seeking his face is
[52:54] the most thing that God need and is the
[52:57] most difficult thing for us that's
[53:03] right are we
[53:05] together praise the Lord you know
[53:08] seeking his face is when two lovers look
[53:12] look in eye to
[53:14] eye praise the Lord if there is no
[53:16] relationship if you look at somebody
[53:18] they will turn their face right but when
[53:21] there is a
[53:22] relationship you can look at them I can
[53:25] put my forehead on the face of my my
[53:27] little girl my nose on her nose and we
[53:30] look eye to
[53:31] eye are we together because of the
[53:35] connection of the relationship I will
[53:37] never be embarrassed she will never be
[53:42] embarrassed so there is something about
[53:46] our intimacy with God
[53:50] right that he require us to seek his
[53:54] face
[53:56] we can humble
[53:57] ourself in the best way we know how we
[54:01] can pray in the best way we know how the
[54:05] Lord has helped us to turn away from our
[54:07] Wicked Ways but seeking his
[54:11] face seeking his
[54:13] face praise the Lord so we want to talk
[54:16] about seeking his face tonight it is to
[54:19] is to cultivate a quality time with the
[54:22] Lord it is you as a as a believer you as
[54:27] a bride of Jesus Christ cultivating a
[54:30] quality time a time where you will spend
[54:33] with him I saw brother Bram say
[54:35] something yeah I will jump from that one
[54:37] let's go to
[54:39] uh let's go to uh
[54:45] uh brother W what did you do
[54:48] now the message Pride if if the the I
[54:51] will Tech can put the message PRI see
[54:54] what what the prophet of God was say
[54:55] here
[54:57] he says
[54:59] now the scripture all tied
[55:02] together praise the Lord scripture all
[55:05] tied
[55:06] together how the Bible means so much
[55:09] more than it
[55:11] speaks if we can only have the Holy
[55:15] Ghost to interpret it to
[55:18] us we only read it as we look down upon
[55:23] it that's what we do if God gave us
[55:26] Grace sometimes we don't even pronounce
[55:28] the words go but we do try to do our
[55:31] best we look into it but see what he say
[55:34] as he goes along but oh how the holy
[55:39] spirit says child of mine you are
[55:43] looking into my face
[55:46] now so brother brandham says the word of
[55:50] God contains more until God revealed it
[55:54] to us so he says we do the best when we
[55:57] open the scripture to read from it but
[55:59] if we could only hear the voice of the
[56:02] spirit that is saying to you you're not
[56:05] just reading a book you are looking in
[56:08] my
[56:10] face praise the Lord you're not just
[56:13] reading a scripture you're not reading a
[56:15] story about Solomon or or or about David
[56:18] or about Mary but what actually you are
[56:21] doing you are looking into my face and
[56:24] that is the and that is the thing that
[56:26] brings a Believer when he reads A
[56:29] promise or he reads something that
[56:31] structs him deeply he hold that word you
[56:34] say oh God thank
[56:38] you why because you have seen more than
[56:41] what is written on the
[56:47] pages are we together
[56:52] amen he says oh
[56:59] or how the holy spirit says my child you
[57:03] are looking into my face now when you
[57:06] look into the
[57:08] Bible this is what I want you to
[57:12] know praise the Lord so you see that
[57:16] that that moment that Grace that God
[57:19] gave to us to be able to cultivate to be
[57:24] able to to to you know uh uh H set up a
[57:28] little time I mean it it don't have to
[57:30] be uh you know uh uh a carry on or the
[57:33] show of but just that little time where
[57:36] you take if it just a verse that you
[57:39] want to take and if the my people that I
[57:41] called by my name and you read it over
[57:44] and over and say God I'm called by your
[57:47] name shall humble
[57:50] themsel humble thems Lord your people
[57:54] that are called you just take that time
[57:57] and you know that you are just having it
[58:00] with the
[58:02] Lord are we together we are just you are
[58:05] just having it with the Lord now so just
[58:08] like I was saying if you if if you if
[58:11] you if you didn't grabb where I was
[58:12] going Sunday it almost sounds like I'm
[58:16] trying to get away prayer meeting or
[58:18] trying to get Church away or trying to
[58:20] get praying you know from but we have to
[58:23] realize look at this Jesus while he was
[58:27] here his disciple came to him and says
[58:29] he says Master why are we not praying
[58:32] and fasting like John and his disciples
[58:35] the Bible actually say like John
[58:37] disciples and the
[58:40] Pharisees so you see these disciples
[58:43] they were so used to that organization
[58:46] way of doing
[58:47] it that when the Messiah came on the
[58:51] scene they wanted to bring that same
[58:54] thing back to this
[58:56] he said
[58:57] no he said
[59:01] no how can the
[59:04] bride amen when the bridegroom is here
[59:08] now so the pattern there is that
[59:11] whenever God
[59:13] moves he bring us out of the
[59:16] organization and he want for us to get
[59:19] away from the organ because if the way
[59:21] they were doing it is right God will not
[59:23] move out of the system
[59:27] praise the
[59:28] Lord you follow brother Brandon he says
[59:31] you hear the church say let's T he says
[59:33] there is nothing like taring because the
[59:35] Ho Holy Ghost have already
[59:38] come we can have an all night prayer but
[59:41] we can't TI it what because what you
[59:44] will be doing is that you will be
[59:46] doubting what happened in Acts chapter
[59:50] 2 because that commission was for ACT
[59:53] chapter 2 now you see it does not take
[59:57] all night prayer meeting away it does
[59:59] not take fasting and waiting the Lord
[1:00:02] but if you are if your mindset is to do
[1:00:05] what is is ordered in Acts chapter 2
[1:00:09] then you are actually out of the
[1:00:11] scripture because what God promised in
[1:00:14] Acts chapter 2 according to Jo and
[1:00:17] according to Isaiah he fulfilled
[1:00:20] it so you see when the when when the
[1:00:23] Pentecostal Church goes with mindset
[1:00:26] what they trying to do is that they are
[1:00:29] they are trying to repeat the days of
[1:00:31] Pentecost right but we have to believe
[1:00:34] that the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:37] here amen he's here amen and that's the
[1:00:41] reason why I was saying you know uh uh
[1:00:44] and and one of the reason why I was
[1:00:45] saying that is that like I said on
[1:00:48] Sunday you know when we come through the
[1:00:50] doors when the service open and and the
[1:00:52] ones that are come that that that that
[1:00:55] get the grace to make it youren you have
[1:00:57] to believe that uh uh it's it's a Grace
[1:01:01] that is given to you you also have to
[1:01:03] believe that that's a
[1:01:07] Ministry praise the Lord because you see
[1:01:11] many times that's the human nature if we
[1:01:15] come and I I just meet one one person
[1:01:18] here it does not make that time
[1:01:21] important to me it looks like if it was
[1:01:24] important the whole church would be
[1:01:26] before at
[1:01:28] 7:00 so because I just meet one or two
[1:01:31] person here the next day well I just
[1:01:33] drag my feet it's not a burden to
[1:01:37] you it's not a burden to you if it's a
[1:01:39] burden to you you you watching your time
[1:01:42] you want to be there whether there is
[1:01:43] one person whether there is no you want
[1:01:45] to be there and that Grace that is upon
[1:01:48] you you must not despise it that Grace
[1:01:51] that is upon you does not make you more
[1:01:53] spiritual than anybody that Grace that
[1:01:55] is upon you does not make you fulfilling
[1:01:58] all of the Prophet word and anybody it's
[1:02:00] just a Grace God has given you that
[1:02:02] Grace to be the one that will come and
[1:02:05] intercede before the congregation
[1:02:11] comes Lord bless the ones that are
[1:02:13] coming to service tonight be with them
[1:02:16] Lord bless the service tonight you know
[1:02:18] and and and that's the that's that's the
[1:02:19] thing we do so you are already
[1:02:24] interceding so you see it will be a
[1:02:26] complete reputation and it will be a
[1:02:29] despise for
[1:02:32] ACT which mean everything that they did
[1:02:34] they did it for themselves let's open
[1:02:36] the service now it's now the service
[1:02:39] going to open
[1:02:42] no if you look in there he talks he says
[1:02:45] he said come and wait on your
[1:02:47] ministry right just like the pastor will
[1:02:51] be back there waiting on the Lord and
[1:02:53] studying the word before he comes the
[1:02:55] musician must must do the same the song
[1:02:57] leader must do the same the congregation
[1:02:59] must do the
[1:03:00] same are we together
[1:03:05] amen by no means we're not trying to
[1:03:07] take worship away we're trying to
[1:03:11] find find uh right we want to be right
[1:03:14] in the word and do things the right way
[1:03:17] Amen to the best that we know if the
[1:03:20] Lord help us to see anything different
[1:03:22] we will bring it to you amen praise the
[1:03:25] Lord
[1:03:27] but you see that's that's what that's
[1:03:28] the thing that the church is caught up
[1:03:30] in most of the thing now that is
[1:03:33] pressure in the church is what we are
[1:03:35] seeing on social media is how the the
[1:03:38] worship leaders of the word are are
[1:03:40] leading sons and all of those people and
[1:03:42] you can't compare those people with you
[1:03:44] right now look at something that brother
[1:03:47] brand sh
[1:03:48] you look at this perfect uh uh perfect
[1:03:52] strength perfect strength
[1:03:56] look at this you will you will
[1:03:57] appreciate it he says he said look at
[1:04:00] all our churches and
[1:04:02] denomination and our evangelists and
[1:04:04] healing campaigns and everything else we
[1:04:07] had and what it is worse than it ever
[1:04:11] was in the beginning is it worse of
[1:04:14] today than it ever was
[1:04:17] because that we have try to do it in
[1:04:22] human
[1:04:23] ability they gather together and make
[1:04:25] long prayers and go on now take for
[1:04:28] example they say prayer of the nation we
[1:04:31] declare this day prayer of the
[1:04:34] nation praise the Lord and many of those
[1:04:37] people that gather prayer for
[1:04:38] Minneapolis you know Minneapolis church
[1:04:40] prayer you know uh and many of those
[1:04:42] people that gather they are coming for
[1:04:45] the
[1:04:46] ceremony praise the Lord amen because
[1:04:51] that that's where idolatry is because if
[1:04:54] we think that because we come to church
[1:04:57] Wednesday night and
[1:04:59] Sunday well I mean uh uh uh uh uh and we
[1:05:03] just doing that out of Duty then we are
[1:05:07] appeasing our
[1:05:08] Idol that's right because they will do
[1:05:11] all that thing you know Church of the
[1:05:13] nation and then stay in that church of
[1:05:15] the nation and start preaching against
[1:05:17] women wearing
[1:05:19] pants St in that church of the nation
[1:05:22] and start talking against LGBT all those
[1:05:25] people that have gathered they will
[1:05:26] start fting with you then upon what are
[1:05:29] we coming together to have prayer of the
[1:05:32] nation what are we basing it
[1:05:37] on what are we basing it
[1:05:41] on and because of manifestation you find
[1:05:44] many around the message that have gone
[1:05:46] after Pentecostal laying hand slaying
[1:05:49] people in the spirit and all of that
[1:05:50] because we want manifestation
[1:05:58] instead of uh the church
[1:06:00] word all of those people AA Island and
[1:06:03] all of those guys Tommy and osbor he sat
[1:06:06] right down there in brother Brandon
[1:06:07] meeting and see and they were they were
[1:06:09] all asking Tommy osbor asked brother B
[1:06:12] brother you I have the gift of healing
[1:06:14] he said Tomy you go out there I know I
[1:06:16] know you you are a man of Faith why they
[1:06:19] they were watching even all of these
[1:06:21] that's the that's the you see every one
[1:06:22] of them uh uh uh Church Embassy chis and
[1:06:26] uh uh solom whatever name they called
[1:06:28] him they always have a little clip on
[1:06:32] William
[1:06:35] Brandon they want to break into that
[1:06:38] that realm they want to break in they
[1:06:40] want to find out you know but it was
[1:06:43] just for one gift for a
[1:06:47] generation there will be nobody that
[1:06:49] will be able to repeat that so anybody
[1:06:52] striving to do that will just be
[1:06:54] impersonating
[1:06:58] because of the same result you find
[1:07:01] people sitting under the message of the
[1:07:04] hour yet they are going to uh uh their
[1:07:07] prayer Giants around the
[1:07:09] world praise the lord they're going to
[1:07:12] prayer oh there is that man down there
[1:07:14] he can pray for people oh that that
[1:07:16] Pastor in the message we really don't
[1:07:17] have
[1:07:22] prayer praise the Lord why because we
[1:07:25] want to get in the exercise of it oh let
[1:07:28] come and pray Lord Jesus everybody stand
[1:07:29] up let walk around nobody sit down
[1:07:31] everybody let's pray let's pray let's
[1:07:33] pray let's pray pray pray pray what is
[1:07:36] that what is that is that what we call
[1:07:40] worship what is the
[1:07:44] reference that's the reason why brother
[1:07:46] brandham says your long prayers must be
[1:07:49] in your closet
[1:07:51] yes because before you realize it we
[1:07:54] start listening to one another the other
[1:07:56] brothers say Elohim I want to say
[1:07:59] Jehovah it just become a competition
[1:08:02] that's right the sacr is
[1:08:06] gone the people just walks
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:14] out this message is not
[1:08:17] Pentecostal no it's not Pentecostal but
[1:08:21] yet many are trailing into Pentecostal
[1:08:23] that's right why because we love the
[1:08:25] emotion we love the
[1:08:34] sweat but said they lost a long time
[1:08:38] ago that's why Jesus said watch the
[1:08:41] scripture when Jesus talks about uh uh
[1:08:46] uh how the Pharisees love long prayers
[1:08:49] what was the setting of the
[1:08:50] Scripture it was that man that was
[1:08:52] standing in the temple Lord I'm not like
[1:08:54] this sinner
[1:08:57] on Jesus said those are the people that
[1:09:00] that that that corrupt widows right they
[1:09:03] explo the people because all they're
[1:09:06] trying to do they're trying to make
[1:09:08] theirself to stand out before
[1:09:11] everybody so you don't have enough faith

[1:13:15] able to grab the concept you know uh the
[1:13:19] they were playing the Sunday school tpe
[1:13:21] and I was back there but I have t about
[1:13:23] this for the long time
[1:13:26] I thought about it and I would just I
[1:13:28] just watching the PN and say I think
[1:13:31] there is a lot of repetition Jesus
[1:13:33] warned us of
[1:13:36] reputation he warned us of

[1:18:10] to face as a man speaketh unto his
[1:18:14] friend and he turned again into the camp
[1:18:19] but his s Joshua the son of Na a young
[1:18:21] man departed out of the Tabernacle now
[1:18:24] Moses had returned to the people and
[1:18:27] Moses said unto the Lord see thou say

[1:19:38] face of
[1:19:41] God when you are in his abiding presence
[1:19:45] let's read a little
[1:19:46] bit now wherein shall it be known yet
[1:19:50] that I and thy people have found Grace
[1:19:52] in thy sight
[1:19:55] praise the Lord amen I do in uh uh find
[1:20:00] Grace in the side okay we have read that
[1:20:01] let's drop down uh we we you can we can
[1:20:04] do all of the reading we will we will
[1:20:07] miss the whole thing here now 17 the
[1:20:09] Lord said unto Moses I will do this
[1:20:12] thing also that thou has spoken for thou
[1:20:15] H found Grace in my sight and I Know
[1:20:18] Thee by
[1:20:20] name and he said I beseech thee show me
[1:20:25] thy
[1:20:26] Glory he say show me thaty Glory that's
[1:20:29] what Moses said and he said I will I
[1:20:32] will make all my my goodness path before
[1:20:35] thee and I will proclaim the name of the
[1:20:39] Lord before thee and and and will be
[1:20:41] gracious to whom I will be gracious and
[1:20:44] will show Mercy unto whom I will show
[1:20:46] mercy and he and he said thou can not
[1:20:51] see my face but I thought God just spoke
[1:20:53] to Moses face to face
[1:20:56] then why is he saying thou shall not see
[1:20:57] my face if it was just Lal
[1:21:05] face praise the Lord the Bible just said
[1:21:09] he he speak to God face to face like a
[1:21:11] man with his
[1:21:17] friend praise the Lord where are we now
[1:21:20] verse 28 and he said th can I see my
[1:21:23] face for there is no man seeing in La
[1:21:27] that's why the prophet of God said we
[1:21:29] read the Bible but there is more in here
[1:21:32] than we can see amen we are looking in
[1:21:35] his
[1:21:36] face you look closely you'll see all the
[1:21:39] The Little Dot every time you look you
[1:21:41] will see something different that you
[1:21:42] have not
[1:21:44] seen if there's a if there's a little
[1:21:46] bumb that come on his face you will see
[1:21:49] it and the Lord said behold there is a
[1:21:53] place by me and thou shal stand upon the
[1:21:56] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[1:22:00] glory pass
[1:22:02] by why my glory
[1:22:06] pass praise the Lord so what Moses will
[1:22:11] see is the glory because God is a
[1:22:16] spirit God is a
[1:22:19] spirit amen
[1:22:25] so the F to face is not the physical
[1:22:29] face it's because the pillow of cloud
[1:22:33] covered the Tabernacle and the presence
[1:22:36] of God Moses was in the presence of God
[1:22:41] he was abiding in the presence of God
[1:22:44] right when you are abiding in the
[1:22:48] word praise the Lord you are walking
[1:22:51] daily in the word
[1:22:54] you are very sensitive of his abiding
[1:22:58] presence praise the
[1:23:01] Lord he said my glory will pass
[1:23:05] by that I will put thee in the Cliff of
[1:23:08] The Rock and will cover thee with my
[1:23:11] hand while I pass and I will take away
[1:23:14] my hand and thou sht see my backpack but
[1:23:17] my face shall thou now see now in
[1:23:21] chapter 34 that's where
[1:23:24] Paul would take in the book of
[1:23:26] Corinthian when Paul started to speak of
[1:23:29] how Moses how to Veil his
[1:23:32] face after the after this experience you
[1:23:35] go in verse 34 that was when the glory
[1:23:37] of God came and when Moses came out his
[1:23:40] face was
[1:23:43] shining and he had to put a veil over
[1:23:46] his
[1:23:48] face praise the Lord if the people that
[1:23:52] are called by my name
[1:23:55] if they will seek my
[1:23:58] face what is
[1:24:02] it if they will seek my
[1:24:06] face there is a
[1:24:09] glory and that was Jesus
[1:24:12] prayer that the glory that we have with
[1:24:15] the father must return
[1:24:18] back there is a glory that the
[1:24:21] church will walk in
[1:24:25] she don't need the the the the the the
[1:24:28] the gimmicks of the word to make her
[1:24:31] look like a
[1:24:33] church she don't need a gimmicks she
[1:24:36] don't have to copy the the things of the
[1:24:39] church oh they are doing this there no
[1:24:41] no no no there's a glory that abide in
[1:24:44] his
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:50] presence there's a glory of the abiding
[1:24:53] presence
[1:24:56] when a person is seeking God first it's
[1:25:00] not going on a hunger strike
[1:25:02] either no because God bring men into
[1:25:06] those
[1:25:09] places praise the
[1:25:11] Lord are we together so there's a
[1:25:15] restoration the restoration of the word
[1:25:18] has returned the glory of God back to
[1:25:21] the church the glory that was
[1:25:23] departed if you if you hear about azuza
[1:25:26] street right here in America right in

[1:25:36] song uh uh the comforter has
[1:25:40] come he's staying right there on the pit
[1:25:43] and he's sinking the comforter has come
[1:25:45] the comforter has come the people that
[1:25:47] witness they say you can see a cloud
[1:25:51] hanging in the building
[1:25:55] it was not the feeling of an of of an
[1:25:58] anointing you can see the
[1:26:01] cloud why because God was restoring his
[1:26:04] word he was restoring the gift that that
[1:26:06] was the move of God God was identifying
[1:26:09] with it so what he did he brought the
[1:26:11] glory of his presence down
[1:26:16] amen the glory of his presence that
[1:26:18] being restored to us is the
[1:26:23] word it's not the

[1:31:30] one she was a queen she knew who she was
[1:31:34] she knew that she was not just a
[1:31:37] concubine she changed the other of the m
[1:31:41] and
[1:31:43] Persians because normally the queen will
[1:31:46] have to be call for the king will have
[1:31:48] to stretch his his scepter for her to
[1:31:51] move but she stepped into the Royal
[1:31:54] Palace the king said ja oh what are you
[1:31:58] doing here what is it what is it you
[1:32:01] want I give you half to my
[1:32:05] kingdom praise the
[1:32:08] Lord why because she abide in his
[1:32:12] presence she sought the face of
[1:32:16] God now Paul will tell us in Hebrew
[1:32:19] close right here there's a whole light
[1:32:22] here I will get through but Paul Will
[1:32:24] Tell Us in Hebrew
[1:32:26] 11:6 that God is the rewarder of them
[1:32:29] that
[1:32:30] pray is that what the scripture says
[1:32:35] no diligently seek that's right God
[1:32:39] reward them that not them that pray or
[1:32:42] them that
[1:32:43] sing God is the you know diligently
[1:32:46] reward them that are in church every
[1:32:48] every service day that's not what the
[1:32:51] scripture
[1:32:52] says he he reward them that
[1:32:56] diligently
[1:32:59] seek seek his
[1:33:03] face seek his face that's all Samson
[1:33:07] want that all he wanted he just wanted
[1:33:10] to feel the glory that he had he just
[1:33:14] wanted that atmosphere around
[1:33:17] him praise the Lord sometimes when the
[1:33:20] believer is going through something or
[1:33:22] he want he just want to feel the
[1:33:24] presence of God Maybe by Just singing a
[1:33:27] song or playing the tape when that
[1:33:30] presence come it give you confidence
[1:33:33] that you are more than able to get over
[1:33:36] the
[1:33:37] trial there is an abiding
[1:33:40] presence that's what we must be seeking
[1:33:42] for that's why the prophet of God said
[1:33:45] pray up we pray up before we come to
[1:33:47] church every one of us bring our luck of
[1:33:50] fire just imagine you body in his
[1:33:53] presence I'm body in his
[1:33:55] presence and we come to
[1:33:58] church it will just be a clash of the
[1:34:01] supernal amen angels will just be
[1:34:04] bumping into one another
[1:34:06] right praise the
[1:34:11] Lord if the people that are called by my
[1:34:15] name if they will humble thems and
[1:34:19] prayed if they will seek my
[1:34:22] face and turn from their wicked ways I
[1:34:26] will hear from heaven and I will heal
[1:34:29] their land musicians you can
[1:34:33] come praise the
[1:34:39] Lord I hear people leave the message of
