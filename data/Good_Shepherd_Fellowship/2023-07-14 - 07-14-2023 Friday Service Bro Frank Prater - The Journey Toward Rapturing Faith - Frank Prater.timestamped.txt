[1:18:41] wires amen it reminds my church that
[1:18:44] we're not the only one that does stuff
[1:18:46] like that once the service gets started
[1:18:48] right amen so it's real good let's turn
[1:18:51] quickly now into the book of First
[1:18:53] Corinthians chapter 10.
[1:18:55] amen we're going to speak tonight on the
[1:18:59] journey toward rapturing faith
[1:19:01] and uh I just recently spent uh about 25
[1:19:06] hours preaching this to my church not 25
[1:19:09] hours straight you understand it was 25
[1:19:11] hours divided into a number of services
[1:19:14] preaching this topic only there at home
[1:19:18] I had a different subject with it was
[1:19:20] called the I am series
[1:19:23] but some of my folks that are watching
[1:19:25] tonight uh they'll they'll understand
[1:19:27] that I have condensed this and I don't
[1:19:31] have 25 hours to spend here and with you
[1:19:34] folks at Good Shepherd so I'm going to
[1:19:36] try to condense some of these thoughts
[1:19:38] tonight if I can get by with it but in
[1:19:41] First Corinthians chapter 10 beginning
[1:19:43] in verse 1 and reading through verse 11.
[1:19:46] amen the word of God says moreover
[1:19:49] Brethren I would not that you should be
[1:19:50] ignorant which is simply means unlearned
[1:19:53] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:19:56] cloud
[1:19:57] and all pass through the sea and we're
[1:20:00] all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and
[1:20:04] in the sea and did all eat the same
[1:20:06] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[1:20:09] same spiritual drink for the drink of
[1:20:12] that spiritual rock that followed them
[1:20:14] and that rock was Christ
[1:20:16] but with many of them not with all but
[1:20:20] with many of them
[1:20:22] God was not well pleased for they were
[1:20:26] overthrown in the wilderness now these
[1:20:29] things were our examples to the intent
[1:20:32] we should not lust after evil things as
[1:20:36] they also lusted
[1:20:38] neither be ye idolaters as were some of
[1:20:41] them
[1:20:42] as it is written the people sat down to
[1:20:45] eat and to drink and Rose up to play
[1:20:48] verse 8 neither let us commit
[1:20:51] excuse me
[1:20:54] amen I have two of these uh tablets one
[1:20:59] of them turned into Chinese while I was
[1:21:01] waiting to come in here and so I've
[1:21:04] learned to bring two
[1:21:06] and this one here goes a little bit
[1:21:09] faster than I'm uh able to do amen so
[1:21:12] verse 8 again neither let us commit
[1:21:14] fornication as some of them committed
[1:21:17] and fell in one day three and twenty
[1:21:19] thousand neither let us tempt Christ as
[1:21:22] some of them also tempted and were
[1:21:25] destroyed of the serpents neither murmur
[1:21:27] ye as some of them also murmured and
[1:21:30] were destroyed of the Destroyer
[1:21:33] now all these things happen unto them
[1:21:35] for in samples and they were written for
[1:21:39] our admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:21:43] world are come I think they're written
[1:21:45] for us right amen so as you're seated I
[1:21:48] ask that you asked the Lord to add a
[1:21:50] blessing to the reading of the word of
[1:21:52] God tonight you may take your seats
[1:21:54] amen so what we're looking at tonight is
[1:21:57] a comparison
[1:21:59] of The Exodus as it would apply to
[1:22:04] rapturing Faith or to the rapturing
[1:22:07] message and tonight as we go through
[1:22:09] this and I offered brother uh one
[1:22:12] opportunity for him or some other
[1:22:15] preacher to take some of these Services
[1:22:16] because I didn't come just to be heard I
[1:22:20] come to amen here myself
[1:22:22] so on these events all of these events
[1:22:25] that happened in this Exodus Journey
[1:22:28] according to the text that I just read
[1:22:30] we can find a type of our journey toward
[1:22:35] rapturing Faith that's for the church
[1:22:38] General that's for the entire body but
[1:22:40] we can also find examples for our
[1:22:43] individual walks with Walk With Jesus
[1:22:46] Christ amen now I know that everybody in
[1:22:48] here would hopes to take the body change
[1:22:50] right everybody in here is looking for
[1:22:53] rapturing Faith so amen we got this
[1:22:56] these examples in the Bible of what we
[1:22:58] should do and what we should not do
[1:23:01] especially those of us who live at the
[1:23:04] end time now all of us believe I believe
[1:23:07] that most of us in here would say
[1:23:09] certainly amen with all the events that
[1:23:11] we see today we must be near the end of
[1:23:15] our journey the rapturing faith must be
[1:23:19] very close the body change amen should
[1:23:21] be up on us very quickly so our journey
[1:23:24] toward rapturing faith and the messages
[1:23:27] for our individual walk is contained in
[1:23:31] these things that we're going to be
[1:23:32] looking at this is not a deep Revelation
[1:23:36] I'm not going to be bringing you any
[1:23:37] deep Revelations tonight or tomorrow
[1:23:40] amen I'm just going to try to share with
[1:23:42] you amen how you can be assured that you
[1:23:46] are hearing a rapturing faith messages
[1:23:49] amen and it will come by Revelation
[1:23:52] right I believe that's what brother
[1:23:53] Brown said the Rapture is a revelation
[1:23:57] and the bride will be waiting for that
[1:24:01] Revelation amen now they he didn't say
[1:24:04] this is it he said they will be waiting
[1:24:07] for that Revelation when he preached the
[1:24:09] Rapture message he didn't say this is
[1:24:11] that he said they will or she will be
[1:24:14] waiting for that revelation of rapturing
[1:24:17] Faith amen so I think that we should be
[1:24:20] able to see God doing things among the
[1:24:22] bride in this hour I think that we ought
[1:24:24] to keep our eyes open our ears Amen in
[1:24:27] tune we with the word of God and with
[1:24:30] the happenings around us as we look at
[1:24:32] the events of our journey toward
[1:24:33] rapturing Faith amen remember what he
[1:24:36] said in First Corinthians 10 6. now
[1:24:39] these things were our examples right
[1:24:43] amen so that God's going to lay this out
[1:24:46] and it'll be so plain that a man like
[1:24:49] myself a wayfaring fool can understand
[1:24:51] amen what God is doing in this hour and
[1:24:54] I really want to understand what God is
[1:24:57] doing and I know that God sent you a
[1:24:59] pastor amen that will help you have have
[1:25:02] faith in the word of God so that when
[1:25:04] the time comes for God to do something
[1:25:07] Supernatural you're ready for it to
[1:25:10] happen
[1:25:11] amen so studying The Exodus Journey you
[1:25:14] can follow the trail of their trials
[1:25:17] now there were many trials in this
[1:25:19] Exodus Journey but there were many
[1:25:22] blessings also there were many
[1:25:24] mountaintops there were many valleys
[1:25:26] there were many things that took place
[1:25:29] that they cause to happen them on cells
[1:25:33] amen and there was always invitations
[1:25:35] from God Amen for for a way out of the
[1:25:39] situation that they had gotten
[1:25:41] themselves into and so as we look at
[1:25:44] this we understand the Bible said amen
[1:25:46] for us not to lust after they lusted
[1:25:50] after evil things now naturally when we
[1:25:52] talk about this word lust certain things
[1:25:54] come to mind amen but it's not going to
[1:25:57] be entirely like as the word conveys us
[1:26:01] of what this lust is some of the things
[1:26:03] that they lusted after were some of the
[1:26:06] same things that you might find in your
[1:26:09] life you might find that in yourself
[1:26:11] that you're looking at things in a way
[1:26:14] that amen will hinder your walk with God
[1:26:17] and listen to me church we don't want no
[1:26:19] hindrance right an old sister that
[1:26:22] recently passed away she said I don't
[1:26:23] want nothing here Amen to hinder me when
[1:26:26] she sang a song I don't want anything
[1:26:28] here to hinder me well I don't either so
[1:26:30] amen let me look at these examples in
[1:26:33] the Bible so that I can shed all the
[1:26:36] things that are hindering me amen and
[1:26:39] come to this rapturing face now all
[1:26:42] these things happened amen for ex and
[1:26:45] samples in samples the Bible said and
[1:26:47] they are written for our admonition upon
[1:26:49] whom the world the ends of the world
[1:26:52] have come amen so we go in now we begin
[1:26:54] the journey everybody knows when The
[1:26:56] Exodus Journey began amen it did not
[1:26:59] begin with Moses it did not begin with
[1:27:02] amen the burning bush it did not begin
[1:27:05] uh uh with the slavery it began in
[1:27:09] Genesis 15 verse 13. amen when God is
[1:27:13] dealing with Abraham and God is bringing
[1:27:16] Abel at the time Genesis 15 it's Abram
[1:27:19] but just let me call him Abraham God is
[1:27:22] speaking to Abraham about what's going
[1:27:24] to happen in the future and he tells
[1:27:27] Abraham he says I want you to know for a
[1:27:29] surety that thy seed shall be a stranger
[1:27:32] in a land that is not theirs and Shall
[1:27:35] Serve them and they shall afflict them
[1:27:36] 400 years amen that's actually the
[1:27:39] beginning of the Rapture because God has
[1:27:42] spoken it and when God speaks it expect
[1:27:45] it
[1:27:46] you say praise the Lord for that when
[1:27:48] God speaks at church expect it now amen
[1:27:52] God has spoken to us also right he's
[1:27:55] spoken to us in math uh uh First
[1:27:58] Corinthians I believe chapter 15 amen
[1:28:01] there will be a body change
[1:28:03] right in the moment and then the
[1:28:05] twinkling of an eye
[1:28:07] that's God's business right amen now
[1:28:10] somebody might think that the Rapture is
[1:28:12] going to take place in the moment in
[1:28:13] twinkling eye but that's far from the
[1:28:15] truth amen because the Rapture has
[1:28:17] already started it's a process of events
[1:28:21] amen but the body change will come in
[1:28:23] the moment in the twinkling of an hour
[1:28:25] at the last Trump right amen I don't
[1:28:28] know that it's president Trump but I I
[1:28:30] know the amen there is a trumpeting
[1:28:32] sound that's going to cause us to have a
[1:28:35] body change right amen so we begin to
[1:28:39] look at these things and the prophecy
[1:28:41] has been spoken
[1:28:44] there will be a body change in the
[1:28:48] moment and in the twinkling of an eye
[1:28:51] can you say praise the Lord amen and
[1:28:54] because we know that that prophecy must
[1:28:57] come to pass because it's just like
[1:28:59] genesis 15 and 13. amen your children
[1:29:02] will be in Egypt for 400 years now they
[1:29:05] were not slaves for 400 years amen they
[1:29:08] only became slaves after Joseph passed
[1:29:11] away right amen uh that that's just a
[1:29:14] little bit of extra it don't mean it
[1:29:16] cost you anything to get that little
[1:29:17] tidbit amen amen but nevertheless we
[1:29:21] look at this
[1:29:22] amen there will be a Rapture can you say
[1:29:25] praise the Lord amen so if there is
[1:29:27] going to be a rapture we know that we
[1:29:30] ought to be prepared for it amen so at
[1:29:33] the time
[1:29:34] for the prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:29:37] we begin to see God begin to set things
[1:29:40] in motion
[1:29:42] is that right amen he began to get
[1:29:45] things ready
[1:29:47] now this will if this Rapture comes upon
[1:29:50] you amen and you are ignorant of it that
[1:29:54] is going to be your fault
[1:29:56] right amen because God is in a five-fold
[1:29:59] Ministry to take these things that
[1:30:01] brother random gave us and make them so
[1:30:03] plain before us that we will be able we
[1:30:06] should be able just to walk by faith
[1:30:08] amen into this thing that we are so
[1:30:11] diligently looking for in this hour
[1:30:14] so when God began to things to begin to
[1:30:17] set things in motion for the prophecy to
[1:30:19] be fulfilled amen I'm sure everybody is
[1:30:21] familiar with this God heard something
[1:30:23] going on in Egypt
[1:30:26] are you with me
[1:30:27] amen he heard something going on in
[1:30:29] Egypt I don't know how long these
[1:30:31] children cried I don't know how long
[1:30:34] these children of Abrahams cried I don't
[1:30:37] know how long they were slaves but amen
[1:30:40] they absolutely began to cry out
[1:30:43] something that was in their heart
[1:30:45] right I mean what was it they began to
[1:30:48] cry out let us go into the Wilderness
[1:30:51] and let us worship our Lord right that
[1:30:56] was something that God placed in their
[1:30:58] heart
[1:30:59] it wasn't something that Pharaoh had
[1:31:01] taught them it wasn't something that
[1:31:04] Moses had taught them because he had
[1:31:06] been gone for 40 years remember
[1:31:08] when they began to cry out through
[1:31:11] pre-depth predestination let us go and
[1:31:15] worship Our God oh my amen you
[1:31:18] understand God hears amen the slightest
[1:31:22] Cry of your heart Amen to get right with
[1:31:25] him God hears amen the The faintest
[1:31:29] Whisper that comes from your soul amen
[1:31:31] that wants you to get closer to him that
[1:31:34] seed that God has placed in You by
[1:31:37] predestination amen when it begins to
[1:31:40] cry out amen for a connection with the
[1:31:42] Holy Spirit when you begin to hunger and
[1:31:45] thirst after righteousness when you
[1:31:47] begin to Long more for God Amen than you
[1:31:50] do for the things of this world Amen God
[1:31:53] is hearing those things amen God Amen
[1:31:57] wants to move in your midst God wants to
[1:31:59] move in your soul
[1:32:01] amen So It Begins
[1:32:03] the children of Israel begin amen crying
[1:32:06] out in their heart let us go and let us
[1:32:10] Worship the Lord
[1:32:11] amen and God begins now to set things
[1:32:15] get the things in order we find what
[1:32:18] happens because there's a seed a life in
[1:32:22] these people crying out amen for the
[1:32:25] Rapture The Exodus it's CR they're
[1:32:28] crying out for it let this thing come to
[1:32:31] pass there there is amen a desire in us
[1:32:34] to be close to God to worship this God
[1:32:37] even though we don't know anything about
[1:32:39] him amen there's something inside of us
[1:32:41] that's crying let us go let us get out
[1:32:44] of this situation that we're in
[1:32:46] if you're comfortable in this world Amen
[1:32:49] something's wrong
[1:32:51] you say Amen if you're pleased with this
[1:32:54] world something is wrong
[1:32:55] if you've got amen more of a desire to
[1:32:59] be at a ball game tonight then you have
[1:33:01] to be in church something is wrong
[1:33:04] not with amen the message but something
[1:33:07] is wrong amen with your experience in
[1:33:09] God
[1:33:10] as we get move into amen rapturing mode
[1:33:14] Church there ought to be something
[1:33:16] stirring in our soul amen I want this
[1:33:19] more than life itself
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:23] so things begin to get set in motion
[1:33:27] until we find that God calls his Prophet
[1:33:30] messenger Moses on the side of a
[1:33:33] mountain amen one day with a bush that
[1:33:36] was seemed to be on fire
[1:33:39] but it would not burn
[1:33:41] think about it
[1:33:43] amen we realize that is Mount Sinai
[1:33:46] right
[1:33:47] amen I want to take you to a message
[1:33:49] entitled the attraction on the mountain
[1:33:51] 1965
[1:33:55] on July the 25th
[1:33:57] brother Branham is talking and it's near
[1:33:59] the end of the service
[1:34:01] and he says that he's talking about
[1:34:04] salvation
[1:34:05] was the attraction on Mount Calvary
[1:34:09] what is the attraction on Mount Calvary
[1:34:11] salvation
[1:34:13] but then notice what brother Branham
[1:34:14] says after he makes that statement he
[1:34:17] said the same attraction on Sunset
[1:34:19] Mountain
[1:34:20] Nebo
[1:34:22] Mount Sinai all the different Mountain
[1:34:26] Top experiences
[1:34:28] now I'm going to slow down some Amen to
[1:34:32] try to bring forth the thought that I
[1:34:35] really have on my heart
[1:34:36] amen if you really want to look for God
[1:34:39] and what God has done and what God is
[1:34:41] doing to get us ready for the Rapture
[1:34:43] amen take this quote from Brother
[1:34:45] Branham
[1:34:47] that if there was a Mount Sinai
[1:34:50] experience
[1:34:51] to get the people ready for Rapture
[1:34:55] Faith then brother random said the same
[1:34:57] attraction on Sunset Mountain same thing
[1:35:01] on Sunset Mountain that happened Mount
[1:35:04] Nebo Mount Sinai all these different
[1:35:07] Mountain Top experiences right amen so
[1:35:10] when we look around us
[1:35:11] we ask ourselves is there anything
[1:35:14] Amen in comparison in the message of
[1:35:17] this hour that can we can relate amen
[1:35:20] sunset Mountain and say Mount Sinai
[1:35:24] can you say amen amen
[1:35:26] amen now you understand that there's
[1:35:28] more than one experience in the Bible at
[1:35:30] Mount Sinai amen one is the experience
[1:35:33] where God is getting Moses ready
[1:35:37] please amen and begins to talk to Moses
[1:35:41] he's got to form Moses's mind he's got
[1:35:44] to take Moses amen and transform his
[1:35:47] mind to where Moses is the man that will
[1:35:50] go down and do the job
[1:35:52] do you say Amen Moses will be the man
[1:35:55] Moses even says I can't do it Moses
[1:35:59] tells God you've got the wrong man
[1:36:01] you've made a mistake I I can't do this
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:05] I'm getting ahead of myself
[1:36:09] amen but it's Mount Sinai and when I get
[1:36:12] into this and they return to Mount Sinai
[1:36:15] amen after they cross the Red Sea then
[1:36:17] they return to Mount Sinai hey but we
[1:36:20] can find the same thing in this message
[1:36:22] that happened at Mount Sinai amen only
[1:36:25] it happened on Sunset Mountain for us
[1:36:27] what was it church amen it was God
[1:36:30] coming down in a pillar of fire
[1:36:32] communicating amen with his people
[1:36:34] giving them the directions that they
[1:36:36] were to follow as they journeyed on
[1:36:39] towards the Promised Land
[1:36:41] thank God we've got the directions from
[1:36:44] a prophet that went to Mount Sinai amen
[1:36:47] he got the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:36:49] and brought them back to the bride and
[1:36:51] we know how to live by faith
[1:36:54] we know what's going on around us so the
[1:36:57] same attraction on Sunset Mountain Mount
[1:36:59] Nebo Mount Sinai all those different
[1:37:02] Mountaintop experiences
[1:37:06] each step of the way
[1:37:09] we find Vindication of the message of
[1:37:13] the hour
[1:37:15] you understand that
[1:37:16] amen everywhere that God LED these
[1:37:19] children of Israel these Hebrews
[1:37:22] is the same thing that we can look for
[1:37:25] in the message of the hour
[1:37:27] in other words I know where I'm at by
[1:37:31] examples
[1:37:33] I know what God is doing by examples
[1:37:36] God has not left us ignorant brothers
[1:37:39] and sisters amen he's made the way very
[1:37:43] plain for us to follow each step of the
[1:37:46] way we find Vindication of a message
[1:37:48] amen like seeing what is uh happening at
[1:37:51] Mount Sinai amen we see spiritually
[1:37:54] happening at Mount Sunset aren't you
[1:37:57] glad amen aren't you glad that God gave
[1:37:59] us this message in this hour aren't you
[1:38:02] glad that God gave us such Vindication
[1:38:04] Amen to the world is foolishness to the
[1:38:07] world it's it's unknown tongues amen but
[1:38:09] to the Bride of Jesus Christ it's God's
[1:38:11] completing his love letter
[1:38:15] oh my every time I talk about love
[1:38:18] letters I think about my wife and I's
[1:38:20] courtship
[1:38:21] amen 50 that was 52 years ago we was
[1:38:24] married 51 years ago but 52 years ago we
[1:38:27] were courting and amen I didn't have a
[1:38:29] car and she lived 110 miles away so we
[1:38:31] courted by letter
[1:38:33] amen there weren't many phones back in
[1:38:35] those days and there weren't any cell
[1:38:36] phones at all amen so the only
[1:38:39] communication she and I had was by
[1:38:41] letter and those letters was like a
[1:38:43] hundred and 110 pages long
[1:38:47] hey
[1:38:48] man you talk about a courtship
[1:38:51] amen then one day she got a letter from
[1:38:54] me and said would you be my wife in that
[1:38:56] letter
[1:38:57] amen and I nervously impatiently waited
[1:39:00] for the reply
[1:39:02] amen and it had one word in the letter
[1:39:04] yes Hallelujah
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:09] amen so we're seeing what God Amen has
[1:39:13] given to the bride he's given us such a
[1:39:15] love letter amen that nobody else can
[1:39:18] open it and you say Amen that letter
[1:39:21] with the response to my proposal amen
[1:39:25] was addressed to Frank Prater
[1:39:28] when it arrived in the mailbox my sister
[1:39:30] didn't open it my brother didn't open it
[1:39:33] my brother-in-law didn't open it amen it
[1:39:35] was meant for my eyes and my eyes alone
[1:39:38] [Applause]
[1:39:39] you say praise the Lord
[1:39:41] amen and I want you to know something
[1:39:44] church amen the reason the world is so
[1:39:47] against this message amen they don't
[1:39:49] know that it is the invisible Union of
[1:39:52] the Heavenly groom in the Earthly bride
[1:39:55] man but we do right amen we know what it
[1:39:59] is
[1:40:01] so let me ask you the question
[1:40:03] what is the attraction on Mount Sinai
[1:40:08] the prophet being prepared
[1:40:11] the conversation went something like
[1:40:13] I've already told you Moses arguing with
[1:40:17] God I'm not your man
[1:40:20] I'm not ready amen I can't do this I
[1:40:24] can't even talk Flame
[1:40:26] amen God wasn't looking for Moses's
[1:40:29] language
[1:40:30] God wasn't moving for Moses's abilities
[1:40:34] God was looking for a man amen that
[1:40:37] would do what he was told to do right
[1:40:40] amen we understand that when Moses
[1:40:43] complained to God said God I can't even
[1:40:45] talk plain how can I go down and Lead
[1:40:47] these people out Pharaoh is not going to
[1:40:49] listen to me what was it that God said
[1:40:51] back to him don't worry
[1:40:53] I'll give you Aaron
[1:40:56] and he'll speak for you
[1:40:58] is that right amen Aaron will walk into
[1:41:02] the presence of pharaoh with you
[1:41:04] amen and you know the task is going to
[1:41:07] be hard they're not going to willingly
[1:41:10] let these children go
[1:41:12] amen but I'll go with you I'll be there
[1:41:15] with you every step of the way
[1:41:17] Moses I can't do it Lord don't worry
[1:41:20] about it Moses I'm sending Aaron with
[1:41:22] you what's it mean to us Church don't
[1:41:25] worry about it amen commit it to God and
[1:41:29] God will send the Holy Ghost to take
[1:41:31] care of the situation
[1:41:35] Can't Rap
[1:41:38] amen God don't expect amen you to bring
[1:41:41] it he expects the Holy Ghost to bring it
[1:41:44] to you
[1:41:46] the Holy Ghost somebody say the Holy
[1:41:48] Ghost will do
[1:41:51] amen amen
[1:41:53] so the conversation is going on
[1:41:56] now Moses begins to say well when I get
[1:41:59] down there they're going to want to know
[1:42:00] who sent me
[1:42:02] right
[1:42:03] they're going to want to know your name
[1:42:06] God's purpose is being revealed
[1:42:10] amen you tell them
[1:42:13] that my name you see up until this point
[1:42:15] God didn't even have a name
[1:42:17] is that right up at this point until God
[1:42:20] begins to talk to Moses amen God didn't
[1:42:24] even have a name but you go tell them
[1:42:26] I am that I am you set me
[1:42:31] hey man you know what this thought
[1:42:33] conveys to Moses it kind of cuts the
[1:42:36] conversation short
[1:42:38] kind of cuts the conversation where
[1:42:40] Moses is standing there finding every
[1:42:42] excuse in the world why he can't go
[1:42:44] and God giving him every reason why he
[1:42:47] can go
[1:42:48] this cuts the conversation short Moses
[1:42:51] say man has to agree now that God
[1:42:54] conveys a thought to Moses amen by
[1:42:56] telling him you tell them that I am that
[1:42:59] I am has sent you Amen in other words
[1:43:01] Moses amen here's God saying Moses take
[1:43:05] the worry out of it I'm in charge of
[1:43:08] this
[1:43:09] he's amen I'm in charge I've got it all
[1:43:13] geared out
[1:43:16] ain't nobody else Moses
[1:43:19] don't you worry
[1:43:23] I'll do the work
[1:43:25] that's where some of us bride people
[1:43:27] need to surrender
[1:43:29] amen God thank you I give up I'll let
[1:43:32] you take over
[1:43:34] I'll give every situation into your
[1:43:36] hands I'll quit trying to do it I'll let
[1:43:39] you do it do you say amen amen I
[1:43:41] remember the Night February 1 1970 a 20
[1:43:45] year old boy praying at an altar amen
[1:43:48] just off of his deathbed just back from
[1:43:51] Germany out of the army walking down to
[1:43:53] an altar in a little Baptist Church
[1:43:55] didn't even know how to pray just knew
[1:43:57] that amen it was time for me to give up
[1:43:59] I remember the prayer I prayed Lord I've
[1:44:03] tried everything in the world I've done
[1:44:06] it my way I want to surrender to your
[1:44:08] way oh my God God will take over if
[1:44:12] you'll let him
[1:44:14] okay God will take over if you let him
[1:44:18] so when Moses hears God say you tell
[1:44:22] Pharaoh that I am that I am amen has
[1:44:26] sent me not only does Moses understand
[1:44:30] what God is saying when he tells pharaoh
[1:44:34] Pharaoh understands I'll get some more
[1:44:36] of that in just a moment
[1:44:38] ultimately
[1:44:40] the purpose of God's actions the whole
[1:44:44] thing
[1:44:46] is to let another generation know
[1:44:50] that there is a Promised Land
[1:44:54] you say amen amen now what do you mean
[1:44:57] brother Prater to let another generation
[1:44:59] know that there is a promised lamb
[1:45:04] who is it that takes the promised land
[1:45:06] Church
[1:45:07] amen is it that original group that God
[1:45:10] sent Moses down to after that Mount
[1:45:12] Sinai experience
[1:45:15] amen or is it a whole new generation
[1:45:17] that comes
[1:45:18] that crosses over into the promised land
[1:45:20] so everything
[1:45:22] that God is doing
[1:45:24] from the beginning of Moses out Mount
[1:45:27] Sinai amen all the way down to Mount
[1:45:30] Nebo you know Mount Nebo is where Moses
[1:45:33] is taken
[1:45:35] so everything between there everything
[1:45:38] amen is God dealing with a new
[1:45:41] generation
[1:45:43] amen amen
[1:45:46] in other words
[1:45:48] there has to be a new birth
[1:45:52] there has to be a death to an old nature
[1:45:56] there has to be a death amen to what we
[1:45:59] call what brother Bram calls the first

[1:49:35] hear that phrase
[1:49:37] God's Got a Way provided for this day
[1:49:41] amen and that statement church is always
[1:49:45] so important amen that God sent a
[1:49:48] prophet to us to tell us the same thing

[1:50:21] always very important isn't it I mean it
[1:50:23] was always important in The Exodus
[1:50:25] Journey

[1:50:29] to know what God's provided way for the
[1:50:32] day is amen amen amen it becomes a point
[1:50:34] of failure for the Hebrews and the
[1:50:36] journey

[1:50:40] provided way for the day
[1:50:42] amen they failed to see it at the Red
[1:50:44] Sea
[1:50:47] where God will further reveal himself
[1:50:51] without changing the original revelation
[1:50:54] now remember how it starts I am that I
[1:50:57] am
[1:50:58] right I mean God will never change that
[1:51:01] revelation
[1:51:03] but he can add to that Revelation that's
[1:51:06] the difference between a truth and a lie
[1:51:08] amen you can add to truth but you can't
[1:51:11] change the truth
[1:51:13] right that's the way you get caught up
[1:51:15] in a court of in a criminal court amen
[1:51:17] they try to get you to cross yourself up
[1:51:19] and if you ever tell a lie on the
[1:51:21] witness stand amen you will get crossed

[1:51:27] always tell the truth
[1:51:28] amen they'll never get you mixed up
[1:51:31] right amen but you can add to that truth
[1:51:34] in other words so much today and so much
[1:51:36] tomorrow and so much the next day amen
[1:51:38] you can add to it but it will never
[1:51:40] change so God wants to continue to
[1:51:43] reveal himself Amen to these people and
[1:51:46] they begin to reject God's provided way
[1:51:49] for the day
[1:51:50] how did he do it

[1:51:55] where God as I've already said further
[1:51:58] reveals himself
[1:52:00] amen how did he reveal himself to Moses
[1:52:02] at the bush I am that I am

[1:52:07] promised land the first big barrier that
[1:52:10] they'll ever ever encounter Amen to the

[1:55:58] about the new generation that's going to
[1:56:00] cross over and if time allows while I'm
[1:56:01] here this weekend we're going to look at
[1:56:03] them and how they were prepared to get
[1:56:05] into the Promised Land
[1:56:08] hey man
[1:56:12] those that failed in the wilderness
[1:56:14] were not the ones amen that entered into
[1:56:17] the Promised Land
[1:56:18] they failed because of unbelief
[1:56:21] they just would not or could not accept
[1:56:25] God's provided way for the day
[1:56:28] right
[1:56:29] amen
[1:56:32] They didn't accept God's provided way
[1:56:34] with the manna
[1:56:37] remember the reason God sent the men
[1:56:39] what was it they were crying out again
[1:56:42] well they were complaining against Moses
[1:56:45] right would to God that we would state
[1:56:47] in Egypt at least we had wild onions to
[1:56:50] eat
[1:56:55] well I
[1:56:56] jerk some out of my uh front yard the
[1:56:59] other day and my wife fried them up
[1:57:02] and they weren't all that good
[1:57:04] to tell you the truth about it
[1:57:06] I mean they were there and that was
[1:57:08] about it
[1:57:09] we didn't eat them all
[1:57:11] well here these people are crying out
[1:57:13] for something that's so detestable to us
[1:57:15] today
[1:57:17] oh my others think about it so God said
[1:57:19] what else I'll send Mana your way
[1:57:23] and what was in the manner
[1:57:25] amen a sweetness that supplied every
[1:57:28] need they have now that I don't want a
[1:57:30] message on the matter amen but
[1:57:32] everything they had need of was in that
[1:57:34] manner it was sweet to them
[1:57:37] right just like the message of the hour
[1:57:39] sweet to us
[1:57:41] amen sweeten the mouth and bitter in the
[1:57:43] belly but it's sweet isn't it
[1:57:45] and then but
[1:57:48] they complained
[1:57:50] about the manna that God sent once they
[1:57:53] had because he said it because they had
[1:57:55] complained now they he gave them the
[1:57:57] answer and they complained about the
[1:57:59] answer doesn't that sound like message
[1:58:02] believers
[1:58:04] sound like the church oh Pastor don't
[1:58:12] know about that and they're both
[1:58:13] complaining about the same thing
[1:58:15] that's not this church though
[1:58:18] right no nobody in in Good Shepherd amen
[1:58:22] ever ever does the pastor like that not
[1:58:25] here and not in Eagle Lighthouse
[1:58:27] Tabernacle leader
[1:58:31] amen
[1:58:33] so what did God do when they got to
[1:58:35] complaining about the the sweetness the
[1:58:37] sweet bread
[1:58:39] and they said okay then I'll I'll send
[1:58:41] you some meat
[1:58:43] oh buddy did he unload meat on him
[1:58:47] amen if I'm not mistaken brother Jordan
[1:58:49] the Bible teaches us that the meat was
[1:58:51] about waste deep to the people wherever
[1:58:53] they went wherever they looked there was
[1:58:55] quail amen there was meat everywhere but
[1:58:58] what did they get to do about it Church
[1:59:00] complain
[1:59:03] you remember when the Bible said let us
[1:59:05] not lust as they also lusted this is
[1:59:08] what it's talking about
[1:59:10] amen what were they lusting for previous
[1:59:12] things
[1:59:14] oh let us go back what to God that amen
[1:59:17] we could eat what we ate in Egypt
[1:59:21] I want you to know something you ever
[1:59:22] get the Holy Ghost that world is never
[1:59:24] going to taste good to you again
[1:59:27] will you ever get sealed by the Holy
[1:59:29] Ghost hey you won't want that world
[1:59:31] anymore
[1:59:33] if you're having trouble pressing
[1:59:34] through and even thinking that the
[1:59:36] message of the hour is just so
[1:59:39] restrictive and takes so much away from
[1:59:41] me you haven't contacted the Holy Ghost
[1:59:44] yet maybe because the Holy Ghost is
[1:59:46] better even than anything that you have
[1:59:48] the that you could give up anything
[1:59:54] amen so they were lusting after previous
[1:59:56] things
[1:59:59] sometimes we get in the same shape we
[2:00:02] lust after previous things
[2:00:05] they were always
[2:00:08] just
[2:00:09] failing to see
[2:00:12] what God has provided so God leads him
[2:00:14] to Mount Sinai
[2:00:17] and on Mount Sinai
[2:00:19] amen which is God coming down this time
[2:00:23] Moses returning to Mount Sinai Sinai

[2:00:39] just given them tremendous things
[2:00:41] come down in the pillar of fire you know
[2:00:44] writing the Ten Commandments and
[2:00:47] giving them instructions giving them
[2:00:49] word and what's the people begin to do
[2:00:52] amen once the prophet don't return right
[2:00:55] away what do the people do amen they
[2:00:57] begin to
[2:00:58] in false god

[2:01:04] them a false god
[2:01:06] is that right Church amen give us a
[2:01:08] false word give us a false message give
[2:01:11] us something that we had in Egypt kind
[2:01:13] of like the church is going now amen

[2:01:47] to me church amen legalism is for you to
[2:01:50] judge yourself
[2:01:51] it's not for you to judge anybody else
[2:01:54] he said if we would judge ourselves we
[2:01:56] would not be judged amen you don't look
[2:01:58] at another person and say that person
[2:02:00] ain't doing right that person is doing
[2:02:02] this that or the other amen you're not
[2:02:04] the judge you've got to try to use
[2:02:06] something to help yourself amen get

[2:02:59] going to bring this to a close right
[2:03:01] after this part
[2:03:02] you know what God had just done when he
[2:03:05] said when he when he revealed himself to
[2:03:07] them as Jehovah Rapha the Healer is that
[2:03:11] is that right the the Healer Jehovah
[2:03:13] Rapha
[2:03:15] he had just bought them from a place
[2:03:18] called Myra
[2:03:21] right
[2:03:22] he just bought them amen when he reveals
[2:03:25] himself as Jehovah Jireh it's right
[2:03:27] after he had them over here at the Wells
[2:03:29] of the will of Myra you know what Myra
[2:03:31] means bitterness
[2:03:34] and the people are coming through the
[2:03:35] Wilderness again and all mine they're
[2:03:37] all upset you know the the water the
[2:03:40] water we can't drink the water
[2:03:43] bitterness
[2:03:44] the water's so bitter we can't drink it
[2:03:46] the life is so harsh we can't live it
[2:03:49] the message is so difficult amen
[2:03:53] the preachers
[2:03:57] amen
[2:03:59] but what did God do for the bitter
[2:04:01] Waters
[2:04:03] he healed them
[2:04:06] what did how did he heal them
[2:04:08] he showed Moses a tree on the banks of
[2:04:11] the water
[2:04:12] Moses cuts the tree down and goes it
[2:04:15] throws it into the water
[2:04:17] and what does it do
[2:04:19] become sweet
[2:04:22] enough to quench every thirst amen and
[2:04:25] brother random says in talking about
[2:04:26] this he said there's a tree tonight
[2:04:28] spiritually speaking hanging over
[2:04:31] Golgotha
[2:04:33] or the world tonight that'll sweeten any
[2:04:36] bitter Waters that you may be led by
[2:04:39] you say praise the Lord that's right
[2:04:42] that's right Church
[2:04:44] amen God is going to reveal himself as
[2:04:47] Jehovah Jireh Jehovah again amen Jehovah
[2:04:51] of course is the the main name of God in
[2:04:54] the Bible I believe it's used over 6 000
[2:04:56] times the Mighty God uh Rafa amen I I am
[2:05:01] the god the healthy so he had him out
[2:05:02] here in the Wilderness at this journey
[2:05:05] and they come to these bitter Waters he
[2:05:07] sweetens the water for them by Moses
[2:05:10] taking a tree and throwing it into the
[2:05:11] water amen and brother Branham brings in
[2:05:14] the illustration if there's bitterness
[2:05:15] in my life is there anything in my life
[2:05:18] amen that is bitter I always take it to
[2:05:21] Calvary
[2:05:22] I always look to Calvary
[2:05:25] why would you look to Calvary amen
