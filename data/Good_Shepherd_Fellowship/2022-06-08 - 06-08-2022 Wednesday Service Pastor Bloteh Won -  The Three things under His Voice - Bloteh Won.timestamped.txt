[35:38] here with you all bethany and i and the
[35:40] children
[35:41] and um
[35:43] so hard to not just
[35:45] say i have a song from the back of the
[35:47] building
[35:49] i almost i almost
[35:52] did instead of a medley or an extra one
[35:54] loyalist is saying
[35:56] i'll meet you in the morning
[35:59] at the bride riverside
[36:02] now if you never noticed that dad would
[36:04] do a little yodeling in there
[36:06] what are you saying you'll know
[36:08] me in the morning
[36:10] because he always loved that so
[36:12] and you know what there's one thing
[36:14] wrong with that song none of us are
[36:16] going to go up to each other and ask how
[36:18] do you do
[36:19] yeah we all know how we're going to be
[36:21] doing i mean
[36:24] so god bless you um
[36:26] amen
[36:28] blah blah blah say what would you like
[36:30] me to say
[36:31] [Music]
[36:37] i you know i could give so many things
[36:40] about my dad um i i'll just say a little
[36:43] bit of something about him and just
[36:45] the things that he gave
[36:48] us children and to bethany and our and
[36:51] our the children
[36:53] is i'm so thankful is
[36:55] how
[36:56] he was so much about others and
[36:59] he was he had he had faults and he would
[37:02] come and say will you forgive me
[37:05] and you could see just that
[37:07] that process
[37:09] you know brother don
[37:11] um
[37:12] would say you know when that scripture
[37:14] says that
[37:15] behold we are new creatures in christ
[37:17] behold all things that pass away hold
[37:19] all things become new he always puzzled
[37:21] that because he thought well all things
[37:23] are become new why am i still dealing
[37:25] with this old flesh
[37:27] and then he looked in the original greek
[37:28] and it says and are becoming
[37:31] new
[37:32] aren't you thankful for
[37:34] that i'm sure you've seen my carnality
[37:38] and so you don't say amen
[37:40] but just to think that well especially
[37:43] you
[37:44] um but to know that we're all brother
[37:47] juan right in the process praise god
[37:51] that way it can only be said
[37:53] amazing grace i'll speak this out
[37:56] and and right and dad taught us that and
[37:59] i sometimes i think that sometimes the
[38:01] lord has to let me stumble a little bit
[38:02] just to say i am weak but thou art
[38:05] strong jesus keep me from all wrong
[38:09] i'll be satisfied
[38:11] as long as i walk let me walk close to
[38:14] thee
[38:15] um and dad taught us that so much um you
[38:17] could see just near the end of the life
[38:19] his life as you all know him you just
[38:22] how just his his nature just got sweeter
[38:25] and sweeter and it just
[38:28] it's so wonderful to see god work out in
[38:31] him what he did and i'm so thankful for
[38:34] him and um
[38:36] just to see the the miracles that
[38:38] happened and you could tell he was just
[38:40] looking for what i call
[38:42] is jesus happening
[38:44] right in
[38:46] our daily lives and you we would always
[38:48] go to the house just
[38:50] and i'll say
[38:52] dad
[38:53] i got a testimony oh wonderful
[38:56] and you'd say i got one too so i'll wait
[38:59] and we would share these testimonies of
[39:01] what the lord did that week
[39:03] and to me that was the sweetest time i
[39:06] ever had with my dad it's just
[39:09] um you know we didn't do the normal
[39:11] things father and son perhaps of like
[39:13] hunting and fishing like a minnesotan
[39:15] would do and i i miss that but i am so
[39:19] thankful for the heavenly places that we
[39:22] sat in together
[39:23] um and
[39:25] i can just hear that saying amen that's
[39:27] right
[39:28] it's because those are those moments
[39:29] where he could say oh i was
[39:32] talking to so-and-so at work
[39:34] and
[39:35] they
[39:36] had there was a special thing that
[39:37] happened in their life and god showed
[39:39] themselves real
[39:41] to them and so i'm just so thankful for
[39:44] that and that just the times
[39:46] that we would sit at the table together
[39:48] and
[39:49] just reminisce about the good things of
[39:51] the lord and it was just
[39:53] you know the holy ghost only focuses on
[39:55] the positive and to be able to just
[39:58] just keep on keeping on now that he's
[40:00] he's passed on either side and and it
[40:04] you know it's it's a what an honor
[40:07] and a
[40:08] um a privilege that the lord would think
[40:11] enough of us
[40:13] that he would let dad go on right
[40:15] brother blante
[40:16] that we've all graduated
[40:18] because we're mature enough to handle
[40:20] dad
[40:21] handing out us the baton
[40:25] each one of us i mean
[40:27] he played he was such a big part to play
[40:30] and yet each one of us
[40:32] has
[40:33] a participation
[40:35] in that happening that god has for us to
[40:37] share testimonies of what's happening
[40:39] each week with each one of us
[40:42] i'm just so thankful for that
[40:45] um i should read a scripture and then
[40:47] i'll i'll sit down brother blante
[40:49] um you know i just
[40:52] as i was thinking about
[40:54] um
[40:56] dad's uh when it was dad's funeral
[40:59] i was
[41:00] just two scriptures came to mind i'm
[41:03] hoping i can find it
[41:06] is that
[41:08] one of them was that scripture where it
[41:10] said
[41:12] about him that maketh himself poor
[41:16] and how that dad did that so much is
[41:19] he would not worry about anything like
[41:22] faith had said um in that little post
[41:25] she put on facebook today is that if you
[41:27] looked at
[41:28] his self
[41:31] his car
[41:32] and maybe sometimes his outfits a little
[41:35] bit he didn't care about having the
[41:36] status quo
[41:38] he just cared about others
[41:40] i would hear about right sister kelly
[41:42] you'd hear about some things that he
[41:43] would pay for behind the scenes and say
[41:46] dad you could have gotten some new
[41:47] suspenders a new shirt some new pants
[41:50] new shoes
[41:52] no
[41:52] these are i'm fine
[41:55] and so i'm just so thankful that he
[41:57] showed us that example of what true
[41:59] riches is
[42:02] we're the batte
[42:04] thank you god bless you all
[42:11] praise the lord

[43:46] all the time is gone
[43:47] [Laughter]
[43:51] praise the lord
[43:53] but just like what uh brother stephen
[43:56] said i witnessed a little bit of that
[43:59] this gone weekend i was over in chris
[44:01] alaska the
[44:03] helping brother fling with the
[44:07] annual meetings
[44:09] uh
[44:10] uh i was trying to beat myself out of
[44:12] the meetings because i was a little bit
[44:14] tired but brother flynn would not allow
[44:16] me
[44:17] and then but then i realized that it was
[44:19] it was important because
[44:22] he had another brother speaking
[44:25] that
[44:26] that
[44:29] could preach fluently in french
[44:32] so
[44:32] he needed me to
[44:34] to be there or it was good that i was
[44:36] there
[44:37] to be able to interpret for the meetings
[44:40] but what happened is that we were joking
[44:41] he said he said brother you have to come
[44:43] because i don't have a preacher i'm
[44:45] going to have you to preach four
[44:46] services
[44:48] so i said wow four services
[44:50] this is uh they said oh no i'm just
[44:52] joking just come you know i won't have
[44:54] it but i actually preach four services
[44:56] because i appreciate
[44:59] i preached two on my own and i
[45:01] interpreted two so
[45:06] so
[45:09] so i said i said before you were really
[45:11] not joking you were serious about what
[45:13] you were saying
[45:14] praise the lord but we had a good time
[45:16] amen
[45:17] we had a good time the lord blessed the
[45:19] meetings
[45:20] and
[45:22] brother andrews and some of the brothers
[45:23] came from shiva
[45:25] the
[45:26] alaska village and i mean the eskimo
[45:29] village and uh
[45:31] they were they were highly represented
[45:33] in the meetings and
[45:35] and as we were closing the meetings uh
[45:37] uh the last service i preached
[45:39] you know there was just something about
[45:41] uh
[45:43] about uh if you ever visit the people
[45:46] there if you go down
[45:48] to uh to uh shivac you go down to their
[45:52] village
[45:53] you know there are people
[45:56] that
[45:57] [Music]
[45:59] i i would say like this they have they
[46:01] have so much time on their hands
[46:03] you know so much time someone come up to
[46:06] give a testimony
[46:08] i mean you just have to relax you know
[46:10] uh they come to service on time they
[46:12] respect the the you know the church
[46:14] ordering and all of that but when it
[46:16] comes to worship you know they just they
[46:18] have so much time on their hand and and
[46:20] such a beautiful beautiful spirit you
[46:23] know i commended them and encouraged
[46:26] them never to lose the value of that
[46:28] you know it is not uh
[46:30] uh
[46:31] it used to be where churches were were
[46:34] full of dead you know people come to
[46:36] church
[46:37] and and the sister come up to give us
[46:39] pressure and she turned around and says
[46:42] uh
[46:42] uh you know sister dear i'm sorry that i
[46:45] offended you the last time you know i
[46:47] want i want the lord to forgive me i
[46:49] mean when you see a place where the
[46:51] people hearts are open they are ready to
[46:53] confess their sins they are ready to
[46:55] make right publicly i mean there is
[46:58] nothing can hold the presence of god
[47:01] praise the lord nothing can hold the
[47:03] presence of god brother brother andrews
[47:06] wanted me to go down to the village
[47:08] but i was so tired and i didn't hard
[47:11] time so what i did was that i had better
[47:14] steven and gyro went with me
[47:16] so but stephen went to the village to
[47:17] preach why i stay in anchorage so i mean
[47:21] that took care of that took care of it
[47:23] and uh
[47:24] and and he came back in and we met
[47:27] before i left and and gave a wonderful
[47:30] report of the meetings i mean he said
[47:32] saturday night after the service they
[47:35] had a prayer line until almost 1am in
[47:37] the morning
[47:38] praise the lord
[47:40] amen and the people were just you know
[47:43] pouring their hearts so it was it was
[47:45] good
[47:46] but while we were there preaching and i
[47:48] was supposed to interpret for brother
[47:50] uh
[47:52] um
[47:55] i'm forgetting this brother name
[47:58] he's over there in connecticut
[48:00] i was i was going to interpret for him
[48:03] the first night in
[48:04] and
[48:06] i took another bible
[48:09] and i couldn't hardly see the prince
[48:12] and you know i never went i left my
[48:15] glasses
[48:16] inside and i couldn't see the prince so
[48:18] i was struggling there to read and
[48:20] and then the next morning i was supposed
[48:22] to preach and i came on the pulpit and i
[48:24] saw the bible uh
[48:27] exact one like this i saw it i said oh
[48:30] this bible is here man they are going
[48:32] back now i can see that's this but then
[48:34] i remember
[48:36] i remember the last time brother flynn
[48:38] was here
[48:39] he uh came on the pulpit to preach and
[48:41] he used this bible
[48:43] and he says he said wow
[48:45] the prince are so nice i can see claire
[48:48] you know and and all of that
[48:50] but uh uh just that expression
[48:53] because uh brother scott bought me this
[48:55] bible
[48:56] so when brother flynn said that
[48:59] he had an opportunity to buy him one
[49:02] and ship it to anchorage
[49:04] [Laughter]
[49:07] so it just made exactly what you said
[49:09] brother brother stephen so that's the
[49:10] reason why i say all of this
[49:12] just to get to there but the lord bless
[49:14] you tonight let's stand on our feet we
[49:16] will go right into the word of the lord
[49:23] we'll go right into the word of the lord
[49:27] i preach a message uh
[49:29] uh
[49:30] that i started here and i did not finish
[49:33] and i went down there and tried to study
[49:35] and finish and i did not finish so i
[49:37] would come and finish it here
[49:41] praise the lord matthew chapter 27.
[49:45] if you will remember i i spoke this if i
[49:48] remember that should be on uh
[49:51] uh during the easter weekend
[49:53] this was where i spoke from
[49:56] so i will i will go back there matthew
[49:58] chapter 27
[50:08] matthew 27 let's reverse uh
[50:15] actually we started reading from verse
[50:17] 45 but let's drop to verse 15.
[50:22] the scripture says
[50:24] jesus
[50:26] when he had cried again with a loud
[50:29] voice
[50:30] yield of the ghost
[50:33] and behold the veil in the temple was
[50:35] rent
[50:36] in twins from top to bottom
[50:38] and the earth did quit
[50:41] and the rocks
[50:43] rained
[50:45] and the graves were open and many bodies
[50:48] of the saints which slept arose
[50:51] and came out of the grave at his
[50:54] resurrection
[50:55] and went into the holy city and appeared
[50:59] on too many
[51:01] so
[51:01] actually what we were looking at were
[51:04] the three things that took place under
[51:06] his voice revelation chapter 10.
[51:09] let's read revelation chapter 10
[51:11] and then i will
[51:13] have you to have your seat
[51:16] i will do a little review and then
[51:18] find a place to
[51:21] to lead our toss tonight
[51:25] praise the lord
[51:28] revelation chapter 10
[51:32] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[51:35] from heaven clothed with a cloud and the
[51:38] rainbow
[51:39] was upon his head and his face
[51:42] was as it were the sun
[51:44] and his feet as pillows of fire
[51:48] and he had in his hand a little book
[51:52] and he
[51:54] set his right foot upon the seat and his
[51:56] left foot on the earth
[51:58] and crowd with a loud voice
[52:01] as when
[52:03] a lion roleth
[52:04] and when he have cry seven thunder
[52:07] altered their voices
[52:09] praise the lord
[52:13] we will stop right there let's bow yes
[52:15] and pray
[52:16] father we just want to ask your
[52:18] blessings tonight
[52:20] and dear lord father these as these
[52:22] things concern us as they have been
[52:25] applied to our life we want to look at
[52:27] them and and father when we look at
[52:30] these things in your word lord god is
[52:32] not to show how much that we know
[52:36] but in in in reality lord is to
[52:39] appreciate what you have done in our
[52:42] life
[52:43] because we know to god father just like
[52:46] the words that were spoken in the
[52:48] beginning let there be light
[52:50] let the earth bring forth you have
[52:52] spoken upon us today lord you have
[52:55] spoken upon our life you have spoken
[52:57] upon our body you have spoken upon our
[53:00] health our mind for us to be able to
[53:03] bring forth sons and daughters of god
[53:05] that we are tonight so we pray the lord
[53:08] you will just bless us now and as we
[53:11] just look at this do a review and you
[53:14] quicken your word and and speak to us
[53:16] tonight in jesus name we pray
[53:18] amen amen the lord bless you you may
[53:21] have your seed
[53:23] amen
[53:25] praise the lord
[53:30] amen
[53:31] uh
[53:34] alaska is uh uh we are three hours ahead
[53:37] of them so i was able to follow the
[53:39] portion of the service here on sunday
[53:42] just before the service their staff amen
[53:45] so i was in church here on sunday
[53:47] morning
[53:48] and then i had to run from here and then
[53:51] go and get ready for service down there
[53:53] because i was preaching sunday morning
[53:56] so
[53:59] i
[54:00] heard a little about brother
[54:02] dan greetings sister naisha you are
[54:04] welcome
[54:06] and
[54:08] we are glad to have you with us praise
[54:10] the lord
[54:12] amen
[54:13] amen
[54:14] and uh
[54:17] if i'm writer uh i thank
[54:21] uh brother
[54:23] dad and mama uh pretty much spinning
[54:27] uh
[54:28] what would be for now they are last
[54:30] weekend is that right sister grace
[54:32] when are they traveling back
[54:36] okay
[54:37] okay
[54:38] so we will
[54:39] we will keep that
[54:41] praise the lord
[54:43] amen
[54:45] but uh
[54:46] uh we we also glad to have them with us
[54:49] praise the lord
[54:50] amen we are glad to have them with us
[54:55] so we were looking at this
[54:57] and uh uh
[55:01] john says something that i was that i
[55:03] was actually going to speak on tonight
[55:06] but this uh thought of this subject
[55:08] could not leave my heart so i just i
[55:10] just turned to it let's let's look at
[55:13] first john chapter three
[55:19] first john chapter 3.
[55:23] i will read the scripture and then uh
[55:26] maybe some future time
[55:28] we will we will pick that up and speak
[55:30] on it jones said
[55:31] behold what manner of love the father
[55:35] have bestowed upon us
[55:38] that was what i was meditating on
[55:40] through the week
[55:41] and i thought that i would take a talk
[55:43] to speak on it and that's what i was
[55:45] going to title my message that's how i
[55:48] titled my notes
[55:49] what manner of love that the father have
[55:52] bestowed upon us that we should be
[55:54] called
[55:56] sons of god
[55:57] praise the lord
[55:59] amen that word sons of god goes back to
[56:02] the original creation that god made
[56:05] praise the lord is not only speaking
[56:08] about the gender as a man but is
[56:10] speaking about the original creation
[56:13] that god made when he made man male and
[56:17] female
[56:18] praise the lord
[56:20] so
[56:20] the sons and the daughters can can fit
[56:23] themselves right in that in that verse
[56:26] that we should be called sons and
[56:29] daughters of god
[56:31] therefore the word
[56:34] no us not because he knew him that
[56:38] that's right
[56:39] praise the lord
[56:41] beloved
[56:42] now are we
[56:45] the sons of god
[56:48] amen
[56:49] now are we
[56:51] sons and daughters of god and and
[56:53] brother branham used that over and over
[56:56] i was looking at over 300
[56:59] uh courts where he repeated that now we
[57:03] are
[57:04] sons and daughters of god not that we
[57:06] will be but we are amen
[57:10] beloved now we are sons of god
[57:15] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[57:19] be
[57:21] but we know that
[57:24] when he shall appear
[57:27] amen
[57:29] we shall be like him
[57:32] for we shall see him
[57:34] as he is
[57:37] now now for for for for many around the
[57:41] christian cycle
[57:43] they looked to the great resurrection
[57:45] for the fulfillment of this
[57:49] but uh
[57:50] we that have been
[57:52] we had we they have been caught in the
[57:54] move of god in this age
[57:57] we don't look to the resurrection for
[57:59] the fulfillment of this
[58:02] because this has been fulfilled we we
[58:05] are actually in the cycle
[58:09] where now we know
[58:12] that we are sons of god
[58:15] praise the lord and the reason why that
[58:18] this talk affects my mind is
[58:21] just like i said is to appreciate
[58:25] amen
[58:26] see luke 17 30.
[58:33] because see luke 17 tell the the
[58:36] fulfillment of of saint luke 17 teddy
[58:40] that that we are
[58:42] enjoying that we are under
[58:45] as a people
[58:48] as sons and daughters of god
[58:51] that fulfillment the revealing of the
[58:55] son of man
[58:59] because brother branham would tell us in
[59:01] the unveiling of christ thou word uh
[59:05] revealing
[59:07] is the same word that is used here
[59:10] called appearing
[59:17] so when when that when the son of man
[59:20] revealed himself
[59:22] he appeared
[59:24] just like he did to abraham
[59:30] so just like john is saying yet
[59:34] what what people that we are that god
[59:37] will put
[59:39] be so such a love upon us
[59:44] that we are now only calling ourselves
[59:47] sons and daughters of god just by faith
[59:50] but our life has been so affected
[59:56] that we are a witness of our nature
[59:59] change
[1:00:04] and what have done it
[1:00:08] what have done it is is the is the
[1:00:11] revealing of the son of man
[1:00:15] so john is saying here
[1:00:18] now we are the sons of god but just like
[1:00:21] paul said
[1:00:22] we started to look uh it was not very
[1:00:25] clear like looking through a glass
[1:00:28] but as as more as we get closer to him
[1:00:33] it starts getting clearer we start
[1:00:36] identifying ourself
[1:00:39] we start seeing ourself
[1:00:41] the more we get to know him the more we
[1:00:44] get to know ourselves better
[1:00:46] hallelujah
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:50] praise the lord so you look at these
[1:00:52] things it just it just helps you to
[1:00:55] appreciate what god has done in this age
[1:00:59] to appreciate
[1:01:00] the the word of god to appreciate the
[1:01:02] message of the hour to appreciate what
[1:01:05] the holy spirit is doing right now
[1:01:12] so we don't look to the resurrection
[1:01:14] for this
[1:01:15] that the scripture says
[1:01:21] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:01:25] him
[1:01:26] when he when he reveal himself
[1:01:30] when he opened himself when he revealed
[1:01:32] as we as we as we see him through the
[1:01:35] ministry of the revealing of the son of
[1:01:38] man
[1:01:41] it brings us our true identity
[1:01:47] praise the lord
[1:01:50] that's the reason why it's more is more
[1:01:53] than just uh uh uh confessing i'm in the
[1:01:56] message
[1:01:59] praise the lord
[1:02:01] verb says my ministry was to declare
[1:02:04] that he is here
[1:02:05] and then if he is here it's our
[1:02:08] responsibility to see him
[1:02:10] we must be able to see him we must
[1:02:12] identify him
[1:02:13] in his word
[1:02:18] because he has he has given us his
[1:02:20] characteristics
[1:02:22] because god is identified by his
[1:02:24] characteristics
[1:02:28] that's the thing that changed us
[1:02:30] it's not practicing the rules and the
[1:02:32] laws
[1:02:35] it's seen him
[1:02:38] praise the lord when moses saw him in
[1:02:41] the burning bush it took all his fear
[1:02:43] away
[1:02:45] he was ready to get down there to egypt
[1:02:47] and take over
[1:02:54] that's the thing that gave us victory
[1:02:57] when we see him in our experiences
[1:03:02] it beats the fear away
[1:03:07] it raise you up above
[1:03:09] the human nature the struggle
[1:03:12] praise the lord
[1:03:14] amen
[1:03:17] but that's uh we just we just want to
[1:03:20] appreciate the lord for that but tonight
[1:03:22] like i said i'm going back to to look at
[1:03:24] the the three things that took place
[1:03:27] under his voice the bible said jesus
[1:03:29] christ with a loud voice the veil in the
[1:03:31] temple was rented there was an
[1:03:33] earthquake and there was a resurrection
[1:03:36] now uh last wednesday before we we
[1:03:38] traveled
[1:03:40] we were looking at testing john
[1:03:43] we're taking a talk there and looking at
[1:03:45] us in john chapter 16
[1:03:48] where jesus said that when the comforter
[1:03:51] shall come he will reprove the word of
[1:03:53] sin
[1:03:54] because they believe me not he will
[1:03:56] reprove the word of righteousness
[1:03:58] because i have gone unto the father
[1:04:01] and he will reprove the word of joshua
[1:04:04] because the prince of this word is
[1:04:06] already george so there is another three
[1:04:09] element that jesus
[1:04:11] told us to wash for for what the holy
[1:04:13] ghost what the comforter we do we were
[1:04:16] looking at that last wednesday i'll try
[1:04:18] to bring a little bit of that into what
[1:04:20] we want to talk about tonight
[1:04:23] praise the lord
[1:04:25] so
[1:04:35] so we see here
[1:04:37] that
[1:04:38] a future home uh the brother branham
[1:04:41] make us to realize that uh the way that
[1:04:44] god deals with the earth
[1:04:46] you know and and and uh uh noah there he
[1:04:49] brought justification uh through the
[1:04:51] blood of jesus christ dying for the sin
[1:04:54] of the word he brought sanctification
[1:04:56] and there's going to be a baptism of
[1:04:58] fire he says that's that's the same way
[1:05:01] that god deals with us
[1:05:03] as the believer
[1:05:05] so it gave us an idea to understand
[1:05:08] that god had won one goal christ is the
[1:05:11] mystery of god revealed there was there
[1:05:13] was one principal thing on god's mind
[1:05:17] that make him to leave the splendor of
[1:05:20] heaven that made god to leave uh being
[1:05:23] the great antenna spirit to condense
[1:05:26] himself into
[1:05:27] uh
[1:05:28] the logos to come into time the one
[1:05:31] thing that was on god's mind was a plan
[1:05:34] of redemption
[1:05:36] so the plan of redemption
[1:05:38] god's plan of redemption is seen all
[1:05:40] through the scripture
[1:05:42] verb refer that refer to that as god's
[1:05:45] one one god that were on his mind that
[1:05:48] he manifested in a three four purpose
[1:05:51] and so we see that even creation
[1:05:55] creation the almighty god being uh uh
[1:06:00] uh
[1:06:00] you know
[1:06:02] almighty in his strength
[1:06:04] it was nothing
[1:06:07] difficult or impossible for god to have
[1:06:10] created everything in one day
[1:06:13] he could have done it
[1:06:16] but the reason why he breaks it because
[1:06:19] creation was going to
[1:06:22] give a revelation it was going to reveal
[1:06:25] he was going to play out uh a god's plan
[1:06:29] of redemption
[1:06:32] the lord
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:34] genesis chapter 1 in the beginning god
[1:06:36] created the heaven and the earth
[1:06:40] praise the lord and brother branham says
[1:06:42] the bible says god created the heaven
[1:06:44] and the earth period
[1:06:49] that's what he says he says the bible
[1:06:50] says god created the heaven and earth
[1:06:52] period but then verse 2 comes and tells
[1:06:55] us that the earth was now without form
[1:07:00] question and answer in genesis brother
[1:07:01] branham says there's a big period of
[1:07:03] time between verse 1 and verse 2.
[1:07:08] verse 1 gave us a picture of a perfect
[1:07:11] creation that was in god's mind
[1:07:14] just like how we were in god's mind as
[1:07:17] sons and daughters
[1:07:20] then verse 2
[1:07:22] now gave us a picture of a falling
[1:07:24] creation
[1:07:28] that needed redemption
[1:07:33] praise the lord
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:37] the immediate redemption ephesians
[1:07:39] chapter 1 let's get there
[1:07:42] let's get to ephesians chapter one
[1:07:46] we will see the great apostle paul
[1:07:50] dwelling on the same subject
[1:07:57] and it will help us to appreciate
[1:07:59] their better brand and preach what paul
[1:08:01] preach
[1:08:08] ephesians chapter 1
[1:08:10] verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ
[1:08:13] by the word of god to the saints which
[1:08:15] are at ephesus and to the faithful in
[1:08:18] christ jesus grace be unto you
[1:08:21] and peace from god our father and from
[1:08:23] the lord jesus christ
[1:08:26] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:08:29] lord jesus christ who have blessed us
[1:08:32] with all spiritual blessing in heavenly
[1:08:36] places
[1:08:37] in christ
[1:08:39] this brother branham will call the
[1:08:41] believer's position
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:45] this is the police the believer's
[1:08:47] position our position is to be in christ
[1:08:51] that is the acceptable place of worship
[1:08:55] that's where god puts all his blessing
[1:08:59] praise the lord
[1:09:00] so paul started talking to the ephesians
[1:09:03] this way to show them their position in
[1:09:06] christ and and to let them to know that
[1:09:10] god has blessed them has given put in
[1:09:12] all the heavenly blessing
[1:09:14] and and to be out of our position is to
[1:09:17] be away from the blessing
[1:09:19] are we together
[1:09:22] before we continue let's go to uh
[1:09:24] chapter six
[1:09:31] i've shared this principle with you
[1:09:33] before but
[1:09:34] since i'm in the channel of talking is
[1:09:36] it won't hurt to to reveal
[1:09:40] praise the lord
[1:09:42] chapter 6
[1:09:43] paul will come here in chapter 6 and
[1:09:45] then he will
[1:09:47] he will
[1:09:48] uh let us know something
[1:09:51] in chapter 6 verse 10 he says finally my
[1:09:54] bread is be strong in the lord
[1:09:57] and in the power of his might put on the
[1:09:59] whole armor of god that ye may be able
[1:10:02] to stand against the world of the devil
[1:10:05] for we rise not against flesh and blood
[1:10:08] but against principality against
[1:10:11] power against rulers
[1:10:14] of the darkness of this world against
[1:10:17] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:10:19] that's the word i wanted to find that
[1:10:22] word high places have the sins
[1:10:24] seen since as heavenly places
[1:10:27] so we realize that our battle is where
[1:10:30] our blessings are
[1:10:36] praise the lord
[1:10:38] that's the reason why when when a
[1:10:40] believer start recognizing the
[1:10:43] opposition the battle gets intense
[1:10:51] he has blessed us with all blessing in
[1:10:54] heavenly places yet
[1:10:59] we fight against spiritual wickedness
[1:11:02] in the same because that's the thing
[1:11:04] that the devil wants to rob us from
[1:11:07] he wants to take us off of our position
[1:11:13] praise the lord
[1:11:15] so that's that's where our greatest
[1:11:17] battle is is to stand as a son of god is
[1:11:21] to stand as a daughter of god in every
[1:11:23] situation
[1:11:27] praise the lord so as long as we can
[1:11:30] stand on the promise
[1:11:32] not giving in to the symptoms
[1:11:35] praise the lord even though i'm feeling
[1:11:38] weak but i'm standing on a promise
[1:11:40] because god says so
[1:11:42] you are more powerful
[1:11:44] than being in 100 good health and out of
[1:11:48] the promise
[1:11:52] praise the lord you can be in 100
[1:11:54] percent go here take all the vitamins
[1:11:56] take all the ions and take everything
[1:11:59] but out of the promise if you are not
[1:12:01] standing on god's word you are more
[1:12:03] vulnerable
[1:12:05] to be dragged by the devil
[1:12:08] praise the lord
[1:12:10] i mean the devil can he can he can blind
[1:12:12] your eyes he can your legs and
[1:12:15] whatever can be happening to you but you
[1:12:17] said there is a promise in god's word
[1:12:19] this is what god's word says
[1:12:23] and whatever is happening to me is lying
[1:12:26] vanitas i'm going to stand on god's word
[1:12:31] praise the lord
[1:12:36] that's because that's the believer's
[1:12:38] position that's where your blessing is
[1:12:41] that's where the supernatural is
[1:12:48] praise the lord so we we we want to see
[1:12:51] there there's paul open up with the
[1:12:53] believer's position then he said after
[1:12:56] talking about all of the finally let me
[1:12:59] allow you to realize here
[1:13:02] there is a spiritual warfare going on
[1:13:09] are we together
[1:13:10] now so we come back to this the reason
[1:13:12] why i went to this uh you you will soon
[1:13:14] see that so we come back to this we are
[1:13:17] talking about
[1:13:18] those three things that took place on a
[1:13:20] his voice the bible says jesus his last
[1:13:23] voice and on uh in in in his uh copra
[1:13:27] body on this earth on the on the cross
[1:13:31] he cried with a loud voice
[1:13:33] and when he cried with a loud voice
[1:13:36] uh the the ville in the temple rented
[1:13:39] the f uh the earthquake
[1:13:42] and rocks
[1:13:43] were all moving and the scripture let us
[1:13:46] know when the ceterian though uh saw it
[1:13:48] it says surely that this is the son of
[1:13:50] god amen they were able to testify about
[1:13:54] that
[1:13:55] so uh
[1:13:56] so we realized that
[1:13:58] uh uh that that ministry of jesus christ
[1:14:02] that has come to us in this last day has
[1:14:05] also brought to us the effect
[1:14:09] of his voice
[1:14:14] praise the lord
[1:14:16] now let let me say this
[1:14:18] this did not only happen
[1:14:21] under the last voice of jesus because we
[1:14:23] would go over to saint john chapter 11
[1:14:26] and when jesus went to the grave of
[1:14:28] lazarus the bible says he cried with a
[1:14:30] lovers
[1:14:32] and he said lazarus come forth
[1:14:37] praise the lord
[1:14:39] amen
[1:14:40] so
[1:14:41] uh uh uh uh so it is it is at a place
[1:14:45] year
[1:14:46] it is uh uh uh appreciating and
[1:14:49] realizing what the voice of god
[1:14:53] has done to us what the way the voice of
[1:14:56] god has affected us
[1:14:58] it's not a voice that is just in book
[1:15:00] form it's not a voice that is just on
[1:15:02] the tape but it's the voice that have
[1:15:04] the same power
[1:15:07] to bring the same effect
[1:15:13] praise the lord
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:16] now so uh uh unveiling of god if you if
[1:15:19] you if you study the message there you
[1:15:21] will realize brother man he he speaks of
[1:15:24] these things as he goes as he goes along
[1:15:27] talking because we realize that that
[1:15:29] veil
[1:15:30] represented the religious system
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] that they all represented the religious
[1:15:38] system because it was the veil that was
[1:15:41] in the temple
[1:15:44] it was the veil that only the high
[1:15:47] priest could go behind to go into the
[1:15:50] holiest of holi
[1:15:54] praise the lord
[1:15:56] and brother brown have also
[1:15:58] speak and and make us to repre uh
[1:16:01] realize uh unveiling of god that this
[1:16:04] flesh is available
[1:16:09] praise the lord
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:11] it's a deal
[1:16:13] now so we will see here that the veil
[1:16:16] represented their religious system
[1:16:20] so when jesus cried a loud voice the
[1:16:24] bill rented from top to bottom and then
[1:16:27] the prophet will say
[1:16:28] because it was god that did it
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:33] it has to start from the top down to the
[1:16:35] bottom god rented it in two
[1:16:38] because the mercy seat was now coming in
[1:16:41] plain view
[1:16:43] amen god was exposing himself to all of
[1:16:47] his children
[1:16:49] no more will one man go in the presence
[1:16:52] of god for the rest of the people
[1:16:54] every son and daughter of god we have a
[1:16:57] right to go to the mercy throne of god
[1:17:04] are we together
[1:17:05] and that is the same effect that have
[1:17:07] happened to us
[1:17:09] when we when we heard his voice
[1:17:12] he rented our religious bill
[1:17:17] all our religious ideas
[1:17:19] and church ideas from the different
[1:17:22] denominational system or the different
[1:17:24] way we were brought up to understand god
[1:17:27] the voice of god how to rent it
[1:17:31] because you can never approach god if
[1:17:34] you were if you grew up as a catholic
[1:17:36] you know you were taught that you have
[1:17:38] to
[1:17:38] pray to meridian all these things or
[1:17:41] grew up as a
[1:17:42] methodist like myself or grew up like uh
[1:17:45] whatever system you grow up with
[1:17:49] you see and that is one of the thing on
[1:17:52] unless until the voice of god has rented
[1:17:56] your religious ideas
[1:18:00] you will never get to god
[1:18:03] amen you will always want to go through
[1:18:06] a man
[1:18:10] praise the lord
[1:18:13] you will always want to go through a man
[1:18:16] you will you will never be able to have
[1:18:17] that four assets
[1:18:23] praise the lord
[1:18:25] hallelujah
[1:18:29] isn't that isn't that uh i'm amazing
[1:18:32] that when that happened
[1:18:34] actually after that
[1:18:37] the jews never had
[1:18:39] uh they never had a perfect worship
[1:18:42] after that
[1:18:45] they never had a perfect worship because
[1:18:47] right after that they lose their tempo
[1:18:51] and without sharing the blood there is
[1:18:53] no remission of sin they could they
[1:18:55] could not make sacrifice
[1:19:00] why because that system was rented
[1:19:06] are we
[1:19:06] together
[1:19:08] amen
[1:19:09] and that's what the voice of god
[1:19:12] on a monarchive fall in this age is
[1:19:15] doing to you and myself
[1:19:18] until he can rent our ideas
[1:19:22] we are not coming back our cultural mind
[1:19:24] or our religious mind or what we have
[1:19:27] read from you or what we know he's
[1:19:30] renting it to expose us to the voice of
[1:19:32] god
[1:19:38] are we together
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:42] and that's what happened when the seals
[1:19:43] were open
[1:19:48] because all through the ages
[1:19:51] all the reformers and all of those men
[1:19:54] that wrote when they were when they
[1:19:56] wrote about the the the first horse
[1:19:58] rather what did they say they said it
[1:20:00] was the holy ghost
[1:20:05] praise the lord but says i read it he
[1:20:08] says he says i i i turned to be it
[1:20:11] looked logical to see someone on a white
[1:20:14] horse and he's in white
[1:20:17] will be identified with purity
[1:20:21] praise the lord but you see an angel had
[1:20:24] to come down every night to reign those
[1:20:27] understanding
[1:20:29] because that understanding will stop us
[1:20:32] from the effect of the word
[1:20:39] god has to rent it
[1:20:41] and verb come and says no that was the
[1:20:44] antichrist spirit because he had a ball
[1:20:47] he never had an arrow
[1:20:51] praise the lord
[1:20:52] which of course contradicted every book
[1:20:55] that was on the market
[1:20:57] and contradicted every teaching that any
[1:21:00] man has ever taught about the first
[1:21:02] horse rather
[1:21:04] but what was god doing renting the
[1:21:06] religious system to bring himself into
[1:21:08] full view
[1:21:14] so we can have access to him
[1:21:20] praise the lord
[1:21:22] you see
[1:21:24] he do it to the religious system
[1:21:27] and
[1:21:29] he has to do it to us individually
[1:21:35] he has to rent our ideas
[1:21:44] leaning that to our own understanding
[1:21:48] but in order for always acknowledging
[1:21:50] him
[1:21:51] and he will direct our path
[1:21:55] this is a wednesday night the second
[1:21:57] thing that happened under his voice it
[1:21:59] was an earthquake
[1:22:00] which of course an earthquake is a sign
[1:22:02] of joshua
[1:22:06] praise the lord
[1:22:08] it was an earthquake
[1:22:10] and uh uh the last time when i spoke on
[1:22:12] this
[1:22:13] uh our brother brother wesley called me
[1:22:16] in the weekend uh uh the the week couple
[1:22:19] of days after after that sunday and and
[1:22:22] we were talking and you know he was
[1:22:24] commenting on what we spoke about
[1:22:26] and he said something that was very
[1:22:28] beautiful
[1:22:29] i just i just i just dropped that down
[1:22:31] in my notes i said that's very beautiful
[1:22:36] and what was it is that uh
[1:22:38] now brother branham will talk a little
[1:22:39] bit of that here
[1:22:41] let me read
[1:22:43] uh so we will get the picture
[1:22:45] works is fit espress
[1:22:47] brother brown will talk about the blast
[1:22:49] that he experienced
[1:22:51] everybody running
[1:22:52] and trying and trying to get under the
[1:22:55] trucks and and and and
[1:22:58] and everything else
[1:23:00] it went back up again
[1:23:02] he said and and and and he clapped like
[1:23:05] a great thunder went back up in the sky
[1:23:08] again and he come down again
[1:23:11] and done
[1:23:12] that three times
[1:23:14] and when
[1:23:15] it was all over they come over and they
[1:23:18] asked they said what did that mean
[1:23:23] i said i don't know
[1:23:26] i don't want to tell you okay i don't
[1:23:27] want to tell you it was a sign of
[1:23:30] judgment
[1:23:31] and in a few days
[1:23:34] a great earthquake
[1:23:37] is going to strike the west coast
[1:23:42] and it won't stop
[1:23:46] it won't stop why because
[1:23:49] it was a sign of judgment
[1:23:53] it is something that would continue
[1:23:55] going it would keep happening it would
[1:23:58] keep rocking the earth
[1:24:01] until that great explosion
[1:24:06] very brandon said it won't stop
[1:24:10] he says california
[1:24:13] los angeles will sink
[1:24:15] is going down
[1:24:17] it will slide right into the ocean
[1:24:21] now listen to this he says and two days
[1:24:24] after that experience
[1:24:28] alaska earthquake shock alaska
[1:24:32] praise the lord and you know what
[1:24:34] beautiful about it is that that's what
[1:24:36] brother wesley myself was fellowshipping
[1:24:38] around is that it once again from the
[1:24:41] top

[1:26:34] three for being
[1:26:35] body
[1:26:37] spirit soul
[1:26:38] but on our first birth both our body and
[1:26:42] spirit was under the prince of the power
[1:26:45] of the air
[1:26:47] no matter if we were born out of holy
[1:26:49] warlord or we were born in a church or
[1:26:51] wherever we were born we were born on
[1:26:53] that the praise of the power of the
[1:26:56] earth the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:26:58] children of disobedience
[1:27:04] the lord
[1:27:07] we could try to live right we could we
[1:27:10] could practice to live right i mean uh
[1:27:12] uh some of us were born in christian's
[1:27:14] home where our parents taught us to but
[1:27:17] our the nature that was in us
[1:27:20] was honor
[1:27:22] the influence of the prince of the power
[1:27:24] of the air
[1:27:28] praise the
[1:27:30] lord it brings us now to sin john 1 18
[1:27:35] as many that have received him he has
[1:27:38] given them power
[1:27:41] to become
[1:27:42] sons and daughters of god so receiving
[1:27:45] the word of god for our day quickness
[1:27:52] praise the lord
[1:27:53] a quicken us
[1:27:55] woke us up
[1:27:59] it brought us
[1:28:00] over the nature
[1:28:03] that walketh in the children of
[1:28:05] disobedience
[1:28:08] so that is the effect of his voice
[1:28:13] that's what his voice have done to us in
[1:28:15] this age
[1:28:19] that's why we can appreciate the message
[1:28:22] of the hour
[1:28:24] it has made us decent men and decent
[1:28:27] young women
[1:28:29] praise the lord
[1:28:32] even though some of these guys that are
[1:28:34] all fussing with the message
[1:28:36] who have not had a decent life
[1:28:39] if it was not because of this message
[1:28:50] because we were all born we were all
[1:28:53] honored the influence of
[1:28:57] the prince of the power of the earth
[1:29:00] but you have he quickened he says
[1:29:03] the spirit that now walketh in the
[1:29:04] children of disobedience among whom also
[1:29:08] we had our composition
[1:29:10] in time past in the loss of our flesh
[1:29:14] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:29:17] of the mind and whereby nature
[1:29:21] by nature
[1:29:23] our nature that we were born under was
[1:29:26] children of wrath
[1:29:30] even as others
[1:29:32] but god
[1:29:34] who is rich in mercy
[1:29:37] for the great lord wherewith he has
[1:29:40] loved us
[1:29:41] when we were
[1:29:43] there in saints
[1:29:45] have quaking us together
[1:29:49] with christ
[1:29:50] now if you go back to matthew 27 the
[1:29:52] bible says all of those sins that were
[1:29:55] in the earth
[1:29:56] after the earthquake the resurrected the
[1:29:58] willing for the resurrection of christ
[1:30:01] to come into the city
[1:30:04] so in a spiritual way that's what his
[1:30:07] voice have also done to us his voice has
[1:30:11] has opened our grave
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:17] the grave of unbelief that we were born
[1:30:19] under the grave of sin the grave of
[1:30:22] obeying the children of wrath
[1:30:27] his voice has opened our grave and we
[1:30:29] are quaking
[1:30:35] praise the lord
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:40] that's why we can say there with john we
[1:30:42] have passed from death unto life
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:47] because we are no longer controlled by
[1:30:50] that nature of wrath
[1:30:53] we are now controlled by a new birth
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:59] we are controlled by a new birth
[1:31:02] you see young people that's the reason
[1:31:04] why it's not just being in the church
[1:31:09] this world has to affect our life
[1:31:17] it has to rent our veil
[1:31:20] paul being one of the most educated uh
[1:31:24] uh uh scalar of his days
[1:31:26] when he met that pillar of fire it
[1:31:28] rented his bill
[1:31:30] everything that he have ever known
[1:31:34] when he met that word it rented his bill
[1:31:41] praise the
[1:31:42] lord that word
[1:31:46] has to that that cry has to rent our
[1:31:49] veil so we see the same thing is applied
[1:31:51] to our life
[1:31:54] now when you when you understand that
[1:31:57] when you understand what god has done in
[1:32:00] this age
[1:32:02] praise the lord
[1:32:05] changing us from glory to glory how that
[1:32:08] change comes
[1:32:10] it's not by practicing uh uh how to be a
[1:32:13] decent young man and how to be a no no
[1:32:15] no is by being exposed to the world
[1:32:21] but says it's even changing the atoms of
[1:32:23] our body
[1:32:29] press the lord
[1:32:31] now you see it puts you to the place
[1:32:33] where
[1:32:34] you appreciate
[1:32:36] amen
[1:32:37] then you ask yourself
[1:32:40] you ask yourself
[1:32:42] like like like the apostle says unto
[1:32:45] whom will we go then
[1:32:50] if you bring in all of these things uh
[1:32:52] you say sir you know this this thing
[1:32:53] about a message brother branham did you
[1:32:55] out of those things will you bring all
[1:32:57] of on to whom where where will we go
[1:33:04] praise the lord
[1:33:07] until when will we go
[1:33:12] we have realized that
[1:33:15] this is the word of life
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:20] this is the word of life
[1:33:24] this thing has has changed the way that
[1:33:26] we talk
[1:33:28] we have season it has seizing our
[1:33:30] language
[1:33:33] even important in certain words in our
[1:33:35] mouth it almost looks like you put an
[1:33:37] acid on your tongue
[1:33:45] people that were born under the nature
[1:33:47] to cost like sellers
[1:33:50] this this world has given them good
[1:33:52] vocabulary
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:54] it has helped them to talk decent
[1:33:57] they have taught us decency respect
[1:34:07] praise the lord
[1:34:08] god knew how how we would get down to
[1:34:10] such a place that the society would lose
[1:34:13] respect courtesy
[1:34:15] common courtesy is gone
[1:34:17] that god will give his prophet
[1:34:20] to come and preach a message called
[1:34:21] respect
[1:34:23] it was not because there was no title
[1:34:26] it was because there was something that
[1:34:28] was needful for us
[1:34:29] there was something that god will look
[1:34:31] down on the people and says i have a
[1:34:33] people
[1:34:36] that will respect the common value i put
[1:34:39] in the
[1:34:45] thank earth
[1:34:47] like i said it's it's just it's just to
[1:34:50] be able to see it it helps you to
[1:34:52] appreciate
[1:34:53] what this word has done unto us
[1:34:58] it has opened our grave
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:01] we will have been bound to the to the
[1:35:03] ideas of men
[1:35:09] can't you see how even those spirits
[1:35:11] have fought around
[1:35:13] and tried to encamp around the message
[1:35:16] with legalist teaching and all of these
[1:35:18] things just to pull people under that
[1:35:21] control
[1:35:24] when god has rented a veil for his
[1:35:27] children to run into his arms
[1:35:31] run away from the system of men and run
[1:35:34] into the arms of the living
[1:35:41] praise god lord
[1:35:45] now we are not taught to say our pastors
[1:35:47] say our church say we can say the word
[1:35:50] of god's head
[1:35:52] because it's revealed to us we have seen
[1:35:54] it
[1:35:58] it's not our pastor said or our church
[1:36:00] said this is what our no no the word of
[1:36:03] god
[1:36:15] 11 let's just take that one and then we
[1:36:17] will close here it's wednesday night
[1:36:21] praise the lord
[1:36:23] sin john chapter 11
[1:36:25] let's take uh
[1:36:27] lazarus experience
[1:36:30] on a loud voice
[1:36:33] what happened to lazar
[1:36:36] on the loud voice
[1:36:39] praise the
[1:36:50] lord it seems when you you stay under
[1:36:53] his voice
[1:36:56] you you are bound to come up
[1:36:59] amen
[1:37:10] are we together
[1:37:12] the bible says verse 40
[1:37:15] saint john 11 jesus said unto her
[1:37:18] say i not unto deep that if thou
[1:37:21] would have believed that she will see
[1:37:23] the glory of god
[1:37:26] then
[1:37:27] they took him away
[1:37:29] they took away the stone from the place
[1:37:32] where the dead was was laid and jesus
[1:37:36] lifted up his eyes and said father i
[1:37:39] thank thee that thou have heard me
[1:37:42] and i know that that year mean always
[1:37:44] but because of these people we stand
[1:37:47] about
[1:37:48] i say that they may believe that thou
[1:37:52] have sent me
[1:37:54] and when he
[1:37:56] and and when he does have spoken
[1:37:59] he cried with a loud voice
[1:38:03] amen
[1:38:06] and said lazarus
[1:38:08] come forth
[1:38:10] and the scripture said and he that was
[1:38:13] was dead came forth bound hands and
[1:38:16] fought with grave clothes
[1:38:19] and his face was bound about with a
[1:38:23] napkin
[1:38:24] and jesus said unto them loose him
[1:38:29] and let him go now that is the place
[1:38:32] where i want to close this thing
[1:38:34] and and and and just nailed it in yes
[1:38:38] because when jesus cried with the loud
[1:38:41] voice
[1:38:43] the effect of the crowd brother branham
[1:38:46] said he had to say lazarus if not
[1:38:49] there would have been a resurrection
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:55] so he had to call him by name
[1:38:58] amen
[1:38:59] and when he opened your grave he called
[1:39:01] you by name
[1:39:02] if he didn't call you by name everybody
[1:39:04] in your family was going to believe
[1:39:08] but he had to call you by
[1:39:10] name praise the lord
[1:39:13] amen but now see what happened here
[1:39:18] lazarus was
[1:39:20] he was affected by the larvae by the cry
[1:39:23] he came forth
[1:39:25] but there is another part that was left
[1:39:29] he was still bound
[1:39:31] with grave clothes
[1:39:34] so when lazarus came forth he came for
[1:39:36] like this
[1:39:40] praise the lord
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:43] and you find me and you find a lot of
[1:39:45] people that have heard his voice in this
[1:39:48] age
[1:39:49] but the problem there is that they still
[1:39:51] have grave clothes around him
[1:39:55] hallelujah that's right brother you have
[1:39:58] all of these people that have walked
[1:40:00] with the message 40 years they had just
[1:40:02] been in grave clothes
[1:40:04] and napping over their eyes that's why
[1:40:06] they are falling back into the grave
[1:40:08] denying the word they have set them free
[1:40:14] amen
[1:40:15] amen
[1:40:18] there was there is another portion of it
[1:40:26] he had to be loose
[1:40:29] he had to take the knife came from
[1:40:30] around his head so his eyes can see
[1:40:35] they had to take the grave clothes from
[1:40:36] around him so he can lift for his hands
[1:40:38] in praise
[1:40:41] they have to take it from his leg so he
[1:40:43] can walk in the light as the world will
[1:40:46] be revealed unto him
[1:40:49] you can say you believe the message
[1:40:52] and and until you have your grave close
[1:40:54] of you you're just going to be bouncing
[1:40:56] all over the place
[1:41:00] and still have great scent on you
[1:41:05] praise the lord
[1:41:08] oh i believe the messiah baptized in
[1:41:10] jesus name that is all wonderful
[1:41:13] but when you get those graves close of
[1:41:15] you your eyes will come open
[1:41:20] praise the lord
[1:41:22] now you can walk in the liberty that the
[1:41:24] world has given us
[1:41:27] you can go from victory to victory
[1:41:30] you can be able to walk from grace to
[1:41:33] grace
[1:41:34] war from strength to strength
[1:41:37] praise the lord
[1:41:39] hallelujah
[1:41:41] but as long as that grave closes on you
[1:41:43] you will be bouncing from one church to
[1:41:45] another church from one situation to
[1:41:47] another situation from one doubt to
[1:41:49] another doubt and then you will end up
[1:41:51] in another grave
[1:41:57] yes
[1:41:58] then you enter in the grave and says
[1:42:00] that the message is the message get
[1:42:01] problem the message it's all because you
[1:42:04] have a grave clothes on
