[26:36] so
[26:51] seeing us it was still good to us but on
[26:54] sunday morning i
[26:56] got ready to come to church
[27:00] and um
[27:03] last weekend on saturday we had
[27:06] literal olivia and daughter over in
[27:10] and you know summer is a busy
[27:14] season for wasps
[27:18] it's a physicism for
[27:21] the enemy all the time too so
[27:24] anyways um
[27:30] my wife got stung on saturday and uh
[27:35] she didn't say nothing about it she just
[27:39] complained about it she says i got
[27:42] stunned by a wasp
[27:43] i said oh okay but we i gotta find i
[27:46] usually get on
[27:47] on that and and and find the nest to
[27:50] wherever he's at and just
[27:52] annihilate them get rid of them but
[27:55] the week went by and she kept kind of a
[27:58] complaining
[27:59] this itches you know this that
[28:03] on sunday morning i i said how's that
[28:05] how's that stains and i looked at it
[28:08] and it was trying it was starting to get
[28:10] um
[28:11] um what do you call those
[28:14] blisters on them you know and she must
[28:17] be allergic to uh
[28:19] to the sting of a wasp anyways
[28:22] i as i got ready like i was saying i got
[28:25] ready to come to church
[28:26] i said you know i started thinking about
[28:29] paul
[28:30] or brother paul back then in the gospel
[28:34] where he kind of
[28:38] was just riding along and persecute the
[28:42] christians at that age and he got
[28:44] knocked off his uh
[28:47] horse of course you you know the full
[28:50] story of that you know the story behind
[28:52] that but
[28:53] my wife proceeded to to to bring an
[28:55] empty bottle
[28:56] that she had run out of oil
[29:00] and she brought a bigger bottle and i
[29:03] said hmm
[29:04] do you need help with that hun so i said
[29:06] no not really but how are you going to
[29:08] put it
[29:08] you know because those bottles are empty
[29:10] they got this little white cap on it and
[29:12] you can't
[29:13] if you pull pour something in it it'll
[29:16] overflow and you'll spill it
[29:18] so i said let me help you honey and i
[29:20] took it off
[29:21] i took the cap off and as i was
[29:25] just finishing talking about the lord
[29:27] you know and just
[29:28] just meditating on those things that
[29:30] happened back then
[29:32] she started pouring that oil in that
[29:35] other
[29:37] bottle i didn't think nothing of it but
[29:40] it started
[29:41] going all over my hand and her hand and
[29:43] all the stuff and i said hey
[29:44] you know what let me see that you know
[29:47] and i just
[29:48] it just came to my heart for some reason
[29:52] let me see that thing you know and i
[29:54] looked at it again
[29:55] and it was just i said that that looks
[29:57] bad let's let's put some oil on that
[30:00] on that that sting
[30:03] and and and just spray you know so i i
[30:06] put oil i put all my hand put all over
[30:08] it
[30:09] and just pray to the lord and you know
[30:12] what
[30:13] i came to church
[30:16] had a we had a grand time we had a good
[30:19] time in church when i got back home
[30:21] when we dismissed and that was that was
[30:24] communion day if i'm not mistaken
[30:26] this past sunday and i got home
[30:30] and i'm thinking of it on myself i'm
[30:32] thinking you know
[30:34] i wonder if the lord i know in my heart
[30:37] that the lord
[30:38] started the healing process i know she's
[30:40] going to be healed
[30:42] because i i usually don't do stuff like
[30:44] that i just leave it alone you know
[30:46] just let it take its course
[30:49] when i got home i went and we sat at the
[30:53] table
[30:54] to eat and i say hun let me see that
[30:58] that's this thing and you can see
[31:02] that this thing was the the boils were
[31:05] gone
[31:06] the blisters were gone and and and
[31:09] and the sting was starting to clear out
[31:12] it was all red i mean red red with
[31:15] blisters
[31:16] okay and you could see that it just
[31:19] started to clear out the blisters were
[31:21] gone
[31:22] it was starting to clear out it's just
[31:24] just just
[31:25] it's just the lord in action to me
[31:28] you know and i and i appreciate that and
[31:30] i and i just thank the lord for that
[31:32] that to her it was a witness
[31:35] because of course you know she's not
[31:37] coming to church
[31:38] but but to her it was a a
[31:42] witness to her that god is still real
[31:46] you know i know he's real you know i
[31:48] don't nobody has to convince me of that
[31:51] but but to her you know she's seen that

[38:18] living sacrifice holy

[38:25] which is your reasonable rational intel
[38:29] intelligence service and spiritual
[38:32] worship let's pray one more time father
[38:35] we have read your word your word is
[38:37] internal
[38:38] lord this book is blessed father by

[39:18] for the wednesday night i want to speak
[39:20] on sacrifice
[39:22] i was going to entitle the sacrifice of
[39:26] fools but
[39:28] i just think that sacrifice will be
[39:32] enough amen
[39:33] even though we will talk a little bit
[39:35] about the sacrifice of fools
[39:41] because that's one sacrifice that god
[39:43] will not
[39:45] accept the sacrifice of fools
[39:49] amen god will not accept the sacrifice
[39:53] of fools
[39:55] so uh uh i have a
[39:58] i have a quote that i want to i want to
[40:01] start off
[40:02] reading uh
[40:05] and this is it's right there from where
[40:09] jesus met those disciples on the road
[40:13] now you have to listen to me uh uh
[40:16] carefully tonight um i pray that lord
[40:20] will be able to help us
[40:21] and uh i left work and came down to the
[40:25] church and
[40:26] tried to uh just rest my mind a little
[40:29] bit but for some reason i had
[40:31] just a kind of a terrible headache and
[40:34] then i said well let me let me rush home
[40:36] if i can be able to
[40:38] just lay down a little bit maybe i need
[40:41] it
[40:42] kind of for rest because
[40:45] i mean until we get back to church
[40:51] i keep we i keep thinking about church
[40:56] praise the lord amen so
[40:59] uh we we went home and
[41:03] not we're not really able to do much but
[41:07] we will just trust the lord that he will
[41:10] be able to meet us tonight amen
[41:12] spoke with brother prater yesterday he
[41:14] wanted us to
[41:15] want to also send his greetings to the
[41:17] church he looking forward
[41:19] to come up for uh
[41:23] labor day weekend so we will just
[41:25] continue to pray that the lord
[41:27] will be able to keep each and every one
[41:29] of us i will say
[41:31] that uh on sunday uh i
[41:34] saw myself preaching and pretty soon i
[41:37] was going down the air then i caught
[41:38] myself
[41:39] i said well i have to step back so if i
[41:42] do that i'm not doing it intentionally
[41:45] that's the reason why i'm staying there
[41:47] praise the lord
[41:49] amen we're doing our best to keep the
[41:52] rules but
[41:53] if you see me stepping a little bit i'm
[41:56] not trying to break the rules it's just
[41:58] that
[41:59] maybe i've lost my mind amen
[42:03] praise the lord so what
[42:09] uh yeah
[42:12] if the preacher lost his mind it's a
[42:13] good thing amen
[42:16] because you might be able to find the
[42:18] man of christ
[42:19] that way but let's look at this tonight
[42:24] now as we look at the subject of
[42:26] sacrifice
[42:28] and and we go back to the old testament
[42:32] ordinance in the book of leviticus that
[42:35] these with sacrifices
[42:37] there are five
[42:40] major sacrifice let me say that way five
[42:43] major sacrifice that moses
[42:46] gave to the children of israel and
[42:49] uh uh and and those sacrifices
[42:53] that moses gave the people uh
[43:02] those sacrifices is strange you look
[43:04] there in in leviticus chapter one
[43:07] it starts off with the burnt offering
[43:09] sacrifice the meal offering
[43:12] and the peace offering the sin offering
[43:16] and the trespass offering
[43:20] now uh uh those were
[43:23] the the you know the the sacrifice is
[43:26] that the believer
[43:27] comes over to the worshipper comes over
[43:31] to
[43:32] to the tabernacle and he meets the the
[43:34] priest
[43:35] and he he uh uh offered his sacrifice by
[43:40] bringing the lamb
[43:41] or bringing a tortured dove or bringing
[43:44] uh uh a flavor okay
[43:47] for the new offering now all of these
[43:50] five sacrifices was met in
[43:54] our lord jesus christ amen
[43:57] it was met in our lord jesus christ he
[44:02] was our burnt offering when jesus gave
[44:05] himself
[44:05] he never gave a part of himself he gave
[44:09] his all right and in the burnt offering
[44:13] all of the beasts was to be burned
[44:17] praise the lord now there's a reason why
[44:19] i'm saying this
[44:21] and uh
[44:22] [Music]
[44:26] and then the the new offering uh
[44:29] you know the new offering was uh
[44:32] uh the offering that was that was
[44:36] awful without living
[44:39] so it was without living and
[44:43] which of course living uh
[44:46] uh represents sin so christ also
[44:49] fulfilled that
[44:50] we had our peace offering we have a sin
[44:53] offer now if you read the book of
[44:55] leviticus
[44:55] and you and you look into this off into
[44:58] these sacrifices
[44:59] it's amazing that three of these
[45:03] sacrifices
[45:06] [Music]
[45:07] moses used this word that
[45:10] when they are offered to god
[45:14] they they they create
[45:17] sweet smell before the lord
[45:21] and and you will be surprised that
[45:25] sin offering and trespass offering
[45:29] are the only two offering that don't
[45:32] give a sweet smell to the lord
[45:35] now you listen to me carefully tonight
[45:37] as we look at this because
[45:39] there's this reason why i'm approaching
[45:41] this uh
[45:42] uh and and i pray that the lord will be
[45:45] able to
[45:46] to bless it he will be able to get our
[45:48] attention
[45:49] we know that we living in the dead in an
[45:52] age where uh uh i mean
[45:56] with with everything that is happening
[45:59] around the world the religious world you
[46:01] know
[46:03] we know that we are all born in sin
[46:06] shiplet in iniquity coming to the world
[46:09] speaking lives
[46:11] that is truth we are all sinners saved
[46:14] by grace
[46:16] amen but the truth there
[46:20] also is that christ
[46:23] has paid the price
[46:28] and that is the reason why paul the
[46:31] apostle who says
[46:33] uh uh uh she should
[46:36] uh sing continue because of grace he
[46:39] said god forbid
[46:41] because there is a price that is already
[46:44] paid
[46:46] and the purpose of that product that
[46:48] that price that is paid
[46:51] is to redeem us
[46:56] to redeem us and bring us back
[47:00] to our original state
[47:04] are we together now so
[47:08] uh uh looking at that
[47:12] looking at god purpose
[47:15] like uh like uh brother brandon preached
[47:17] the message
[47:18] the creator of sin and the penalty that
[47:21] he took
[47:23] to read sin out of our life that was the
[47:26] reason why
[47:27] christ went to the cross that was the
[47:29] reason why
[47:30] god took the form of a man
[47:35] praise the lord and you know i was
[47:39] i was studying and and i saw something
[47:42] that just gave me the jubilee dance
[47:45] you know uh uh it was just so
[47:49] it it just gave me a jubilee dance in in
[47:52] in
[47:52] israel in israel
[47:56] when when you buy a lane you never
[48:00] buy a land like we buy a land
[48:04] on this side of the world
[48:07] the term of buying the land is just a
[48:10] lease
[48:15] you never buy a land to own it
[48:20] praise the lord man when i was i was
[48:24] studying there
[48:25] whoo i was looking at the the the two
[48:28] different harvesters and i was just
[48:30] telling different things
[48:31] man it just gave me such a dance as oh
[48:34] my goodness
[48:35] what is this you know you you and
[48:38] and the thing there is there because you
[48:40] have to remember
[48:41] they have a jubilee year
[48:46] where the land returned back to its
[48:49] original owner
[48:55] praise the lord amen amen
[48:59] so i mean the devil is just a loser amen
[49:03] because this land is going to return
[49:05] back to its original owner amen
[49:07] at the end of the day praise the lord
[49:10] amen
[49:12] amen so let's let's get back to our
[49:14] offering here
[49:15] so uh christ he
[49:18] he fulfill all the offering the peace
[49:21] offering the meal offering
[49:23] the the same offering the trespass
[49:26] offering the trespass offering
[49:28] is more like the the
[49:32] the guilt offering
[49:35] praise the lord because yet
[49:38] we have we have confessed our sin
[49:42] yet we have accepted the lord jesus
[49:44] christ
[49:45] but the accuser of the brethren
[49:48] will not allow us to be free from guilt
[49:54] so because he will not allow us to be
[49:56] free from guilt there
[49:58] is a guilt offering that is called the
[50:00] trespass offering
[50:04] now but both the sin offering
[50:07] and a trespass offering never bring a
[50:10] sweet smell before god
[50:16] never bring a sweet smell before god
[50:22] what is that telling you tonight
[50:27] praise the lord amen
[50:30] that god is expecting you to
[50:33] identify more with his word than to
[50:36] identify with your sin nature
[50:42] praise the lord shall i say that again
[50:46] can i say it louder praise the lord
[50:50] amen
[50:53] i wish the spirit can follow me let me
[50:55] just speak in tongues
[50:58] amen then they can fall on another
[51:00] person then they can interpret maybe it
[51:02] might grab
[51:03] our attention but god expect us
[51:06] more to be to identify with his word to
[51:10] identify with his promises to identify
[51:13] with the identification that he has
[51:16] revealed to us
[51:17] as sons and daughters of god then to
[51:20] identify with the sin
[51:22] nature because the
[51:26] the the the the thing about
[51:29] this uh uh johnny crowe nature
[51:32] is that whenever we find ourselves
[51:35] in the presence of god we think dead we
[51:38] are
[51:39] appealing to god when we say lord you
[51:41] know i'm a sinner i'm born in sin shall
[51:44] iniquity
[51:45] we think that we are appealing to god
[51:47] that does not bring no good smell to god
[51:57] it doesn't bring no good smell to god
[52:03] because what is happening is that he's
[52:05] he's he's
[52:06] looking at us just like johnny crawled
[52:09] that the rope is cut from his legs
[52:11] but he will not move into the farm he
[52:14] keep running around that tree because he
[52:16] has stayed in that place for many years
[52:20] we got stick brother says sin
[52:24] is a sticky nature we get stick to those
[52:28] things
[52:29] and and and then we want to use that
[52:33] to appeal to god
[52:40] that is the reason why when we
[52:44] when we sin or we trespass we must
[52:47] we must confess it we must approach it
[52:49] by the word
[52:54] if you cover your sin you will not
[52:55] prosper god will not hear your prayer
[53:00] we must confess our sin we must deal
[53:02] with it according to the word
[53:05] and when we deal with it according to
[53:07] the word we must believe
[53:09] that it's settled
[53:17] are we together so as we look at
[53:20] sacrifices tonight
[53:22] that's one of the first thing i would i
[53:24] wanted to
[53:25] look at and then also in sacrifices
[53:28] we have to remember
[53:31] we have to remember in sacrifice in
[53:34] dealing with the subject of sacrifices
[53:37] jesus christ
[53:41] he is the ultimate sacrifice
[53:46] amen he is
[53:49] the priest
[53:53] and he is the offerer
[54:01] praise the lord he is
[54:05] the sacrifice he is the priest
[54:08] and he is the offerer
[54:17] are we together
[54:24] then you say brother one then uh where
[54:26] is our place
[54:34] we are just
[54:38] part of the congregation we adjust
[54:46] witnesses we adjust
[54:50] and in some places
[54:54] with his life in us we become
[54:58] part of the sacrifice i'll try to
[55:02] explain that
[55:07] praise the lord amen
[55:25] lets look at ah
[55:41] when we when we read over in
[55:46] in romans chapter 12
[55:50] and it speaks about
[55:55] presenting our bodies as a living
[56:00] sacrifice
[56:02] which is our reasonable service
[56:05] i went looking at that and and and
[56:10] you know seeing how
[56:13] the prophet of god used that through the
[56:16] through the scriptures through the
[56:18] messages and one of the things that that
[56:21] caught my attention
[56:22] was that uh
[56:25] in as much as it sounds
[56:29] like a dedicated thing which of course
[56:33] it is it is also
[56:37] one of the simplest thing that god
[56:41] asks us to do is to just present ourself
[56:46] be there
[56:49] he wants you to be there
[56:53] he wants you to present yourself be
[56:56] there and in another way
[56:58] brother branham used that as the way of
[57:01] yielding yourself
[57:06] yielding yourself now
[57:10] uh solomon warned us here
[57:13] about offering the sacrifice of fools
[57:21] i did a little reading on the on the
[57:24] book of ecclesiastes
[57:26] and i i got caught up with a thought
[57:28] that if i have to
[57:30] teach on it or preach on it i like to
[57:32] preach on the subject
[57:34] that only the i mean the thing done for
[57:38] god
[57:38] is the only thing that lasts because you
[57:41] will realize that's what solomon
[57:44] brought out of the book of ecclesiastes
[57:46] that only the thing
[57:47] that is done for god will last every
[57:50] other thing
[57:51] is vanity
[57:55] praise the lord but i see as he talks
[57:59] about
[58:00] places in the in the the
[58:03] i mean the market place and the
[58:06] different places
[58:07] he comes to this subject
[58:10] about approaching the house of god
[58:17] approaching the place of worship
[58:24] he says wash your feet
[58:27] as you go into the house of the lord
[58:30] that we will now offer the sacrifice
[58:34] of fools praise the lord
[58:38] amen
[58:43] and that is and that is one of the
[58:46] things we
[58:47] you we have to know that it is one of
[58:50] the
[58:50] spirit of our age laodicea age
[58:54] this age that is rich and in in
[58:57] an increase in ghouls this age that
[59:01] this know it all age have
[59:04] just brought the ancient generation to
[59:07] the place of where
[59:09] people approach god as fools
[59:12] because they are so much trapped in
[59:15] they close the world they have so much
[59:17] trapped in
[59:18] you know everybody's seeing them driving
[59:20] into the parking lot they are so much
[59:22] trash
[59:23] in the big building and the cafeteria
[59:26] and and remember now he says be ready
[59:30] for what
[59:31] be ready to hear which means the
[59:34] ultimate thing
[59:35] in worship is the word
[59:39] if you miss that you miss
[59:42] everything if you miss the word
[59:46] your sacrifice it's a food
[59:50] amen
[59:53] be ready to year
[59:56] that is the highest thing in the house
[59:59] of
[1:00:00] god the highest thing is the word
[1:00:03] what is the sun service for to prepare
[1:00:05] us for the word
[1:00:06] what is the praying for to prepare us
[1:00:08] for the word
[1:00:10] the highest thing is their word
[1:00:18] and sometimes i don't know how people
[1:00:22] would dress themselves up drive to
[1:00:26] church
[1:00:28] and and just at that time for the
[1:00:30] preaching of the world that's when they
[1:00:32] fall asleep
[1:00:38] just at that time for the preaching of
[1:00:39] the word that's when they fall to sleep
[1:00:53] i mean you went through all the
[1:00:55] preparation
[1:00:57] when the lamb was being brought out
[1:01:00] the lamb were you supposed to be
[1:01:03] identified where was brought out
[1:01:05] you fall to sleep right before your
[1:01:07] priest you are sleeping when you're
[1:01:08] supposed to
[1:01:09] lay your hand on the lamb identify
[1:01:12] yourself with the lamb
[1:01:13] to be sacrificed
[1:01:16] they precede you sleeping
[1:01:26] they put every other thing before the
[1:01:30] word
[1:01:36] they would sometimes even put their
[1:01:38] feelings before the word
[1:01:40] well i never enjoy the way the sun seven
[1:01:41] leader lead the leader songs today so
[1:01:44] i mean i'm not even in the spirit
[1:01:58] that is the most tank now so let's let's
[1:02:01] go to this uh
[1:02:02] uh coat here that will be the only one
[1:02:06] i'll read to you tonight
[1:02:07] it's a little bit length late when the
[1:02:09] eyes were open
[1:02:10] they knew him
[1:02:14] and jesus was the christ and everything
[1:02:17] that patin
[1:02:18] told the christ he had vindicated it
[1:02:23] he have vandicated it everything that
[1:02:26] paid him to the christ
[1:02:28] he has vindicated it this this were
[1:02:31] vindicated
[1:02:33] vindication is one of the word that that
[1:02:36] that was that is that was used greatly
[1:02:39] around the message cycle
[1:02:43] vindication and the thing about
[1:02:46] vindication
[1:02:47] is that god do not vindicate a man
[1:02:53] no god don't vindicate any man
[1:02:56] god vindicate his word
[1:03:05] you hear people say god will vindicate
[1:03:08] me
[1:03:09] god will benefit me god do not vindicate
[1:03:12] a man
[1:03:13] god do not vanicate flesh
[1:03:17] he don't vindicate flesh and blood he
[1:03:20] only vindicate
[1:03:21] his word now i
[1:03:24] say this because this will stand
[1:03:28] out this will stand
[1:03:30] out that's the reason why
[1:03:36] no matter what were
[1:03:39] the uh
[1:03:48] miss pronunciation of brother branham
[1:03:50] but
[1:03:51] no matter what uh i mean everything that
[1:03:53] is out there
[1:03:54] brother branham will always at the
[1:03:58] end of his preaching he will always say
[1:04:01] if these things that i have told you are
[1:04:04] the truth
[1:04:09] god will vindicate it
[1:04:13] amen he would say if these things that i
[1:04:15] have told you
[1:04:16] are the truth god will vindicate it
[1:04:21] before he goes into the prayer line
[1:04:26] and that is the reason why he said
[1:04:30] how can the lord allow me to do all of
[1:04:33] these things visions and healing
[1:04:37] and allow me to teach wrong
[1:04:40] because the healing the manifestation of
[1:04:44] the gifts
[1:04:45] was a dedication to the word
[1:04:50] if the word was not right god would not
[1:04:52] back it up
[1:04:54] because god do not back a man
[1:05:00] god do not back a line
[1:05:08] praise the lord so uh uh when
[1:05:11] when when when the people when he came
[1:05:13] over to the opening of the word
[1:05:15] and the people says well you know if
[1:05:16] he's discerning is the spirit of the law
[1:05:18] but when he starts teaching
[1:05:20] he's wrong as the spirit of the devil
[1:05:26] remember god gave moses two signs
[1:05:31] amen remember god
[1:05:34] also taught moses about the voice
[1:05:38] and the sign
[1:05:42] the voice and the sign
[1:05:46] if the voice is right which is the word
[1:05:49] of god
[1:05:50] god will back it up
[1:05:57] okay it looks like i'm going away from
[1:05:59] what i want to get into tonight but
[1:06:00] that's okay
[1:06:04] and jesus was the christ and everything
[1:06:06] that petaine told
[1:06:08] the christ he had vindicated it
[1:06:11] a virgin birth healed the sake discerned
[1:06:14] the thoughts
[1:06:15] of the heart
[1:06:18] everything that he was supposed
[1:06:21] to do to be the messiah
[1:06:25] so those things that he was doing
[1:06:28] healing the sick
[1:06:29] why was god allowing him to do that
[1:06:32] because god was vindicating his word
[1:06:35] that he gave to isaiah a virgin to
[1:06:37] conceive
[1:06:38] god was vindicating his word that this
[1:06:41] man was the messiah
[1:06:46] are we together
[1:06:50] and yet raised from the dead
[1:06:53] and still didn't recognize it and they
[1:06:57] still didn't recognize it they still
[1:06:59] didn't know
[1:07:00] it after the scripture
[1:07:03] had been revealed still they never
[1:07:07] recognized him though he was
[1:07:10] the promised word now remember how
[1:07:13] beautiful
[1:07:14] that is the word that he was revealing
[1:07:18] to them
[1:07:21] showed him they have walked right with
[1:07:24] him
[1:07:25] for three years
[1:07:31] and recognize that know that he
[1:07:34] fulfilled the word
[1:07:38] there they went walking on down
[1:07:42] to emirates is that so hmm
[1:07:45] just didn't understand it they didn't
[1:07:48] get it
[1:07:50] praise the lord amen
[1:07:53] and what i want to say to to us tonight
[1:07:55] especially our young people
[1:08:04] this message is not just
[1:08:07] a a an identification
[1:08:10] in a sense like we are in the message
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:18] with the thing that god is
[1:08:22] is uh is revealing to us from the
[1:08:25] scripture
[1:08:26] understanding these things and the
[1:08:27] things that he's doing in our life
[1:08:30] he wants us to be able to recognize
[1:08:34] and identify his presence
[1:08:38] praise the lord
[1:08:42] every every move of god in our life
[1:08:46] is from glory to glory
[1:08:49] we talk about the attraction on our
[1:08:52] mountain
[1:08:53] god takes us through different
[1:08:55] experiences
[1:08:56] for us to be able to identify him
[1:09:01] you may realize that your experiences
[1:09:03] are now for you
[1:09:04] your experiences is for you to see god
[1:09:12] it's not for you to boast how you went
[1:09:13] 40 days without food
[1:09:17] but for you to be thankful that there
[1:09:19] was a god that sustained you
[1:09:28] and the same thing as a local church as
[1:09:31] a local assembly
[1:09:32] we want to be able to understand what
[1:09:35] god is doing in our little group
[1:09:41] the messages that are coming in the way
[1:09:44] that god is
[1:09:45] helping uh uh uh he's helping
[1:09:49] us one another and things that we are
[1:09:51] seeing we want we want to understand
[1:09:53] that
[1:09:56] it's to be able to identify his presence
[1:09:59] in our midst
[1:10:01] not just that feeling of oh i came to
[1:10:04] church praise the lord the servants were
[1:10:05] good today i enjoy the song enjoy the
[1:10:07] preaching
[1:10:07] thank you brother for the preaching and
[1:10:09] and i mean and then we just go
[1:10:18] because even if i preach in any of the
[1:10:20] brothers that preach
[1:10:22] as it is the ministry of jesus christ
[1:10:25] that is in our midst whether it's a
[1:10:27] visiting preacher
[1:10:28] whether it is any of the local brothers
[1:10:30] in the church that preach
[1:10:32] we must realize that he god will not
[1:10:35] contradict himself
[1:10:39] amen he will not confuse us he's
[1:10:41] bringing us out of confusion
[1:10:50] so we want to pay attention to that
[1:10:54] and trust his grace to help us so that's
[1:10:57] the same thing that brother branham
[1:10:59] is saying here god vanicate
[1:11:02] jesus christ to this disciple when he
[1:11:04] did it he says now we know that thou
[1:11:07] art the christ for no man can do this
[1:11:10] work
[1:11:12] you know they were saying those things
[1:11:14] but it's it's almost
[1:11:16] like they they they see it this is not
[1:11:19] as the christ and then there's a time
[1:11:20] where
[1:11:21] uh when when they get into one trial or
[1:11:23] there's something happening
[1:11:25] you know uh uh their boat is in trouble
[1:11:28] and then they they get they get in
[1:11:30] despair
[1:11:32] they get trouble they forget of what he
[1:11:34] did yesterday
[1:11:37] with all that they have seen
[1:11:40] and he even taught them
[1:11:44] it is needful for me to go for the
[1:11:46] comforter to come
[1:11:47] they were right there they were
[1:11:48] listening to him
[1:11:52] as soon as he was not around they
[1:11:55] started feeling discouraged
[1:11:59] so it said that all his preaching and
[1:12:02] teaching just went over their head
[1:12:04] and he never got it
[1:12:09] and sometimes that's the way we are and
[1:12:12] if
[1:12:12] and if you and if and if we walk with
[1:12:15] god like that
[1:12:16] we will be offering sacrifice of fools
[1:12:20] you have to remember when jesus appeared
[1:12:23] to those men
[1:12:24] that was the first thing he said to them
[1:12:26] all fools
[1:12:28] slow of heart
[1:12:32] all full slow of heart
[1:12:35] you are talking about these things you
[1:12:37] are talking about
[1:12:38] all the things that he did but yet
[1:12:42] you are having doubt in your mind
[1:12:51] are we together
[1:12:55] all fools and slaw of heart
[1:13:01] solomon said we must watch our our steps
[1:13:04] watch our walk with god
[1:13:08] that we ourself will not offer the
[1:13:10] sacrifice of fools
[1:13:18] job says do should we always thank god
[1:13:20] for good things and not for evil
[1:13:22] also
[1:13:27] because when when things started
[1:13:29] happening that it did not expect his
[1:13:31] wife said
[1:13:32] let's cause curse god and die
[1:13:38] you will be offering the sacrifice of
[1:13:44] fools
[1:13:52] we have to know the important thing
[1:13:56] the highest thing in the service is the
[1:13:59] word of god
[1:14:01] that's why the prophet of god said no
[1:14:03] service is complete without the word
[1:14:08] praise the lord no service is complete
[1:14:12] without the word because the word
[1:14:14] is the highest way that god can speak to
[1:14:17] you
[1:14:19] my sheep hear my voice is the highest
[1:14:23] way that he can speak to you
[1:14:26] whether you have the gift of a dream or
[1:14:28] the vision
[1:14:29] you still have to bring all of that back
[1:14:32] to the world
[1:14:38] and are you hearing god speaking to you
[1:14:41] from
[1:14:42] the word of your day
[1:14:46] is he speaking to you from the word of
[1:14:48] your dead is he speaking to you
[1:14:50] from uh uh uh uh the message of yahweh
[1:14:56] now so all of these things let's go
[1:14:58] along a little bit he says notice
[1:15:00] then when a canto told the place
[1:15:04] after him revealing the word over again
[1:15:08] to them
[1:15:08] and show them how christ must do these
[1:15:11] things
[1:15:12] and still they didn't get it
[1:15:15] notice they rebuilt the gut
[1:15:19] them preachers
[1:15:23] for not knowing and recognizing
[1:15:26] their fulfilled scripture
[1:15:30] that was fulfilled before their eyes
[1:15:34] jesus rebuked him
[1:15:40] i mean and and and he will rebuke
[1:15:43] us the same if if uh if we were
[1:15:47] if we would soon be caring about things
[1:15:49] that are popping up on the internet
[1:15:51] and we will soon be caring about i mean
[1:15:53] uh popular views and
[1:15:55] and and people jumping into writers and
[1:15:58] and we start expressing our opinion
[1:16:00] which means we're not listening to what
[1:16:02] the messenger told us
[1:16:05] because prophecy have told us that these
[1:16:07] things will happen
[1:16:18] which means we are not listening
[1:16:23] so he has to rebuke them
[1:16:32] notice the rebuilt the god them
[1:16:34] preachers for not ignoring
[1:16:36] and recognizing the fulfilled scripture
[1:16:39] that was that was fulfilled before their
[1:16:42] eyes
[1:16:46] look tonight i was i was almost
[1:16:50] going to go into something different i
[1:16:51] wanted to talk on the three different
[1:16:53] curtains
[1:16:54] and uh
[1:16:58] but there was there was this this
[1:17:00] particular code kind of for just
[1:17:02] kind of assuming down to talking on
[1:17:04] sacrifices tonight
[1:17:11] because he is our sacrifice
[1:17:14] and he is the word praise the lord
[1:17:18] if we miss the word we miss our
[1:17:20] sacrifice
[1:17:21] there is no way we are identified with
[1:17:23] him and
[1:17:25] and and then we miss him
[1:17:31] notice his word to them fools
[1:17:35] law of understanding
[1:17:41] and how how many times
[1:17:45] many of us can be found in that
[1:17:47] situation
[1:17:51] god keeps teaching us one lesson
[1:17:54] and he keeps allowing things to happen
[1:17:57] for us to grab
[1:17:58] it and we're still not getting it
[1:18:05] and he says i will bring it back again
[1:18:07] see if they will grab it
[1:18:09] and we're still not getting it
[1:18:13] because we are not looking at the
[1:18:15] teacher we are not listening to the
[1:18:17] teacher
[1:18:17] we have put other people into the
[1:18:19] picture
[1:18:25] we have put other people into the
[1:18:27] picture
[1:18:32] take for example if god is trying to
[1:18:34] deal
[1:18:35] with with anger in your life
[1:18:39] he just see a little angry spot
[1:18:42] and he say i have to get rid of that and
[1:18:45] you have to use me
[1:18:46] to step on your toes now if you make me
[1:18:49] the subject you will never see what god
[1:18:52] want to get out of your life
[1:19:04] praise the lord
[1:19:09] are we together
[1:19:14] since we must realize that he's
[1:19:16] preparing us
[1:19:17] for a prepared city
[1:19:21] we're not we not we're not playing
[1:19:23] church
[1:19:24] we're not just coming together
[1:19:27] everything that he's doing
[1:19:28] in our life is to prepare us because
[1:19:31] brother branham says
[1:19:32] we the only thing we leave from here
[1:19:34] with is character
[1:19:36] and he want to make sure that we have it
[1:19:41] he want to make sure that we have it he
[1:19:44] want to make sure
[1:19:45] that we have reverence that we know how
[1:19:49] to reverence him
[1:19:55] because when we when we get there and
[1:19:57] worshiping the lamb the lion will be the
[1:20:00] attraction
[1:20:02] he don't want you not having a character
[1:20:04] or reverend you just looking all around
[1:20:06] looking for something that you don't
[1:20:07] like you never lost
[1:20:09] when the lamb is the attraction he's the
[1:20:12] one
[1:20:12] we must be focusing on he's the one we
[1:20:14] must be worshipping we must put
[1:20:16] no man in that place
[1:20:21] no man must feel that place
[1:20:24] and that's the reason why he's preparing
[1:20:27] us he's pointing us to the word
[1:20:29] he's teaching us the word so we cannot
[1:20:32] put our pastor in that place
[1:20:33] we cannot put the prophet in that place
[1:20:36] now jesus christ
[1:20:37] must fill that place
[1:20:44] because he's preparing us for a prepared
[1:20:47] city
[1:20:54] god will always use man whether to do
[1:20:57] good to you or to do bad to you
[1:21:00] amen he will always use man one man or
[1:21:03] the other
[1:21:04] what a good or bad
[1:21:09] but the one he wants you to see is him
[1:21:20] the one he wants you to see it is him
[1:21:24] so just like paul said present your body
[1:21:28] as a living sacrifice paul was coming
[1:21:31] from under the inspiration
[1:21:33] of the burnt offering
[1:21:36] because the burnt offering every part
[1:21:40] of the animal was burned
[1:21:43] every path surrounding it shows a life
[1:21:46] of surrounding complete surrounding to
[1:21:48] god
[1:21:50] every part remember brother branham
[1:21:53] preached those indoors he says
[1:21:55] people we will allow him in some doors
[1:21:58] of our life and we will shut other
[1:21:59] places of our life
[1:22:01] we have our own personal life our own
[1:22:03] personal
[1:22:04] things that we are doing all when it
[1:22:06] comes to the burnt offering
[1:22:07] is everything every part of that beast
[1:22:12] is burned and when it's burned it just
[1:22:15] gives a good smell to god
[1:22:18] heavenly father said oh i love it i love
[1:22:21] it when it just surrounds
[1:22:23] all and everything
[1:22:43] praise the lord he rebuked them full
[1:22:47] slow to understanding year
[1:22:49] was god himself the resurrected messiah
[1:22:53] walking along with them as we get down
[1:22:56] as we read this and get down you will
[1:22:58] see how brother branham is going to show
[1:23:00] us here
[1:23:01] because people are walking are fools
[1:23:04] they will walk
[1:23:04] right into the council of the world
[1:23:07] churches
[1:23:08] the world council of churches and they
[1:23:10] will not even know it
[1:23:13] that's what happened when a man when a
[1:23:15] person walked
[1:23:16] foolishly before the lord
[1:23:25] you will walk right into the place where
[1:23:28] you will seal yourself
[1:23:29] away from god
[1:23:39] and that was the thing that caught my
[1:23:40] attention this evening
[1:23:46] here was god himself the resurrected
[1:23:49] messiah
[1:23:50] walking along with them showing them
[1:23:54] and the same one is here with us
[1:23:57] showing us that is the thing
[1:24:01] we want to make real that the same
[1:24:03] resurrected christ
[1:24:05] is here with us
[1:24:14] showing themselves why don't you
[1:24:17] understand
[1:24:18] that christ must do these things
[1:24:21] why don't we understand that
[1:24:24] that that that the prophet of god
[1:24:26] brother branham talks about a spirit
[1:24:28] that he identified during the civil
[1:24:30] rights movement
[1:24:31] where he says they will leave multitudes
[1:24:33] to the slaughter
[1:24:41] it was a kind of a i don't want to get
[1:24:43] into those things tonight but
[1:24:44] i mean that that is exactly what we are
[1:24:47] seeing
[1:24:50] that is exactly what we are seeing
[1:24:53] because they are taking
[1:24:54] all of this uh a black live uh uh
[1:24:58] movement or whatever it is and attaching
[1:25:01] it to the civil right
[1:25:02] uh movement taking out of the gay rights
[1:25:05] and attaching it
[1:25:06] to the civil rights movement and all of
[1:25:08] that and what is it doing because it's
[1:25:10] under the wrong spirit
[1:25:12] is leading the people to the slaughter
[1:25:27] he told us about the the the
[1:25:30] the economy of america coming to the
[1:25:34] place
[1:25:35] where it is now because
[1:25:40] this is an image of the beast and she
[1:25:43] must surround
[1:25:44] everything over to the roman power
[1:25:47] rome must step in
[1:26:02] or when the when all of these things
[1:26:03] started uh
[1:26:05] and and and started talking about taking
[1:26:07] temperature
[1:26:08] and he started talking about uh i mean
[1:26:10] all the
[1:26:11] all the online preachers jump on it the
[1:26:14] mark of the beast
[1:26:18] if they take your temperature it's the
[1:26:20] mark of the beast
[1:26:23] he's going to put a chip into your head
[1:26:26] but we have been taught
[1:26:33] we have been taught what it is
[1:26:39] it's just simple rejecting rejecting
[1:26:41] when king
[1:26:42] rejected god instruction he was giving a
[1:26:45] mark
[1:26:46] when you reject the word of god
[1:26:50] god turned you over to a rebellious
[1:26:53] spirit
[1:26:54] a strong delusion
[1:27:02] so that's the thing that's the thing uh
[1:27:04] uh you know trying to contratize
[1:27:06] ourselves
[1:27:07] now feed our minds with the media we
[1:27:09] have a word
[1:27:23] i would rather a young person come to me
[1:27:25] and says
[1:27:26] did brother branham said anything about
[1:27:28] all of this uh uh
[1:27:30] uh uh economy stuff
[1:27:42] sometimes i just i feel so heartbroken
[1:27:45] when i see even
[1:27:46] uh uh uh i mean sometimes preachers get
[1:27:49] so caught up in those things
[1:27:51] and they are sending things you know
[1:27:52] that is floating through
[1:27:54] through the internet they did not even
[1:27:56] read it at some time looking at this
[1:27:58] what is this
[1:28:04] we want things to happen we want things
[1:28:07] to happen there's something i'll share
[1:28:09] with you on sunday
[1:28:10] by the grace of god but let's go ahead
[1:28:12] with this
[1:28:18] walking with them showing them why don't
[1:28:20] you understand that christ
[1:28:22] must do these things don't you know that
[1:28:25] it must be
[1:28:26] this way this way in this way
[1:28:30] and thus and thus there are sequence
[1:28:36] they are anti-sequence that are that are
[1:28:39] unfolding before our eyes
[1:28:49] praise the lord
[1:28:53] we know that by by the word of god
[1:28:58] before that be system fully comes here
[1:29:01] then
[1:29:02] and that anointing takes a man to be
[1:29:04] identified as the man of sin
[1:29:06] the bride must be out of here
[1:29:11] praise the lord
[1:29:14] so whether they are talking about chip
[1:29:16] or what are they whatever they are
[1:29:17] talking about
[1:29:18] it does not bother us
[1:29:22] because a man that is sealed with the
[1:29:25] seat of god don't worry about the mark
[1:29:27] of the beast
[1:29:29] because it's either one or the other
[1:29:35] if you get the seed of god i mean you
[1:29:37] don't have to worry they have to put a
[1:29:39] machine through your head
[1:29:43] you don't have to worry because your
[1:29:46] soul is healed
[1:29:52] if we are not sure that's when we get
[1:29:53] carried is this the mark of the beast
[1:29:56] well am i taking the mark on the beast
[1:30:07] praise the lord
[1:30:12] and all day long espounding to them the
[1:30:15] scripture and still
[1:30:17] is that soul and and they didn't know
[1:30:19] that he was standing
[1:30:21] right there then he looked around
[1:30:26] after he had preached the word and had
[1:30:29] told them
[1:30:31] and showed them the things that was
[1:30:33] supposed to be
[1:30:34] and still they didn't understand it he
[1:30:37] said fools
[1:30:39] slow of heart to understand see
[1:30:41] understand
[1:30:43] the vindicated scripture of the hour
[1:30:48] understand the vindicated scripture of
[1:30:50] the hour
[1:30:51] i was talking to uh uh a gentleman
[1:30:56] one of the guys that was working for us
[1:30:58] here then
[1:31:02] we got into talking a little bit one
[1:31:04] time and we're talking about revival
[1:31:06] talking about you know i was you know i
[1:31:09] was telling them a little bit about the
[1:31:11] revival
[1:31:12] that ran around the country while we are
[1:31:14] having everything we are having because
[1:31:16] because of the rejection of christ and
[1:31:19] and you know and then he was
[1:31:20] also he was also sharing with me you
[1:31:23] know uh uh
[1:31:24] an experience that he had in in some few
[1:31:28] revivals
[1:31:30] then he said he says you know
[1:31:34] there's there's some prophecy that is
[1:31:35] going to come back
[1:31:39] that those days those revival days are
[1:31:41] going to come back
[1:31:45] i said well what i know is that the
[1:31:48] revival is over
[1:31:51] that's why we are having what we are
[1:31:56] having
[1:31:59] we are having such a spirit of apostasy
[1:32:04] strong delusion getting a hold of people
[1:32:12] he says well you know there have been
[1:32:14] some prophecies that is
[1:32:15] those revival days are going to come
[1:32:17] back
[1:32:19] and and and that just that's the church
[1:32:22] world view
[1:32:26] that's the church world view hoping the
[1:32:28] people are hoping
[1:32:34] not realizing that they have despised
[1:32:37] their day of visitation
[1:32:45] and that's the same thing with us
[1:32:52] a desire to pray that desire to read the
[1:32:54] word of god god
[1:32:55] is visiting you don't despise that
[1:33:04] because when it goes away
[1:33:07] you know solomon in the book of uh sons
[1:33:09] of solomon
[1:33:10] he dramatized that he talks about how
[1:33:14] this woman wanted her love to come
[1:33:17] her beloved
[1:33:20] she waited for him she waited for him he
[1:33:23] never came
[1:33:24] until she slept in bed and she went
[1:33:26] under her covers
[1:33:27] and he came and knocked the door and
[1:33:28] knocked the door and knocked the door
[1:33:32] and she and she gave some excuse
[1:33:36] and quickly she woke up to uh to find
[1:33:40] her beloved but he was gone
[1:33:46] praise the lord he was gone
[1:33:49] and and and she's and and and he said
[1:33:51] she went down the street looking for her
[1:33:53] beloved
[1:33:54] and and and and she and she found a man
[1:33:57] that's supposed to be the preacher
[1:33:59] and everyone that she found that wounded
[1:34:01] her
[1:34:02] with false doctrine false teaching
[1:34:08] people with true desire wanting god but
[1:34:11] on the wrong
[1:34:12] anointing wrong teachings being wounded
[1:34:21] so just like paul says
[1:34:25] if god is dealing with your heart open
[1:34:27] your heart to him
[1:34:35] the devil will not tell you to pray
[1:34:44] satan will i give you the thought to go
[1:34:47] and pray
[1:34:52] so if you feel that thought you better
[1:34:54] go and pray
[1:35:01] just having that communion just having
[1:35:04] that devotion
[1:35:05] and having that fellowship with god it
[1:35:08] helped
[1:35:08] us that that is some of the things that
[1:35:11] reduce
[1:35:12] the stress the evil stress that is in
[1:35:15] this day
[1:35:17] just don't do nothing you get so tired
[1:35:21] as safe to say you have been taking
[1:35:22] breaks the whole day
[1:35:24] is the spirit of the age is the spirit
[1:35:27] of the time that we are living in
[1:35:31] just don't make yourself useful
[1:35:36] if you don't make yourself useful you'll
[1:35:38] be useless
[1:35:41] praise the lord you don't make yourself
[1:35:43] useful you just feel useless
[1:35:53] that's the reason why they can just
[1:35:54] dress they just jump on the street
[1:35:56] they're just walking
[1:35:57] from from one street to another what are
[1:35:59] they looking for they don't know
[1:36:01] they're just all out there they're just
[1:36:03] going they're just going they're just
[1:36:04] going at the end of the day
[1:36:09] they can't even tell what they have done
[1:36:10] with their lives
[1:36:12] is the spirit of the age and it's upon
[1:36:15] the people
[1:36:17] it's the last day of spirit
[1:36:21] then it's nine o'clock year so i should
[1:36:24] be able to close here
[1:36:25] let me just drop down yeti and uh
[1:36:29] that would be uh on paragraph 66
[1:36:34] sister faith why the church ought to be
[1:36:37] the most why
[1:36:38] it ought to be in a glorious stage now
[1:36:42] and the power of his resurrection great
[1:36:45] signs and wonder
[1:36:47] listening to that they they have fooled
[1:36:50] around
[1:36:51] so much with this till they are
[1:36:54] walking blindly into
[1:36:58] the incommunica council
[1:37:01] they have fooled around so much with
[1:37:04] this
[1:37:07] pentecostals they are all embracing the
[1:37:10] pope they are all
[1:37:11] embracing unity because they have fooled
[1:37:14] around
[1:37:17] so long that he can no longer take his
[1:37:20] thing for the world
[1:37:21] and that's that's where my emphasis is
[1:37:24] tonight
[1:37:26] offering the sacrifice of fools watch
[1:37:29] how you are walking with the word
[1:37:50] they are blindly walking blindly into
[1:37:53] the incoming
[1:37:54] council to take on the mark of the beast
[1:37:56] and know it now that's exactly
[1:37:59] ignoring his word saying that it would
[1:38:01] do
[1:38:02] it would do that and and the thing
[1:38:05] is it's real good it's
[1:38:08] nice it makes a good offer
[1:38:12] if everybody can be one it makes a good
[1:38:14] offer we can just unite
[1:38:16] it makes a good offer
[1:38:30] let's watch our fault how we go into the
[1:38:32] house of the lord
[1:38:35] amen let's watch
[1:38:39] our steps how we are walking with him
[1:38:44] it must be a just a closer walk
[1:38:48] that's what we need musicians come up
[1:38:51] that's what we need just a closer walk
[1:38:53] and as we walk closer to him we are
[1:38:57] observing the things he's teaching us
[1:38:59] we are observing the things that he's
[1:39:01] saying to us
[1:39:03] praise the lord i mean if we don't come
[1:39:06] to service on time
[1:39:09] it's easy for you to offer the sacrifice
[1:39:11] of fools because there is no time of
[1:39:13] preparation
[1:39:17] no time of preparation
[1:39:24] you either be waiting for the the drum
[1:39:26] to put you in the spirit or the piano to
[1:39:28] put you in the spirit or the bass guitar
[1:39:31] to to just get down all your your bones
[1:39:33] so you can feel happy
[1:39:38] but we must be in the spirit we must be
[1:39:40] praying our heart must be before god
[1:39:43] we must be anxious to praise him
[1:39:46] lord i want to thank you i have come to
[1:39:48] thank you to appreciate you
