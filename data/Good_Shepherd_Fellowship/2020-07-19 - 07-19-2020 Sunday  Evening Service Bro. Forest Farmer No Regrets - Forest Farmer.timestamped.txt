[1:54] [Music]
[3:22] the Lord done some great things and I
[3:24] was just so thankful about it and now uh
[3:27] tomorrow night uh tomorrow is Friday I
[3:30] was thinking tomorrow was Saturday we
[3:31] won't won't forget the businessman's
[3:34] breakfast will be held here I believe at
[3:36] this school and I suppos they sell
[3:39] tickets for them don't they something
[3:40] and they I guess everyone understands
[3:42] just how you get the uh the tickets and
[3:46] so forth for the breakfast we'd be happy
[3:49] if you could come along and see uh feel
[3:51] led to come now uh Billy always tells me
[3:54] said there one thing that you do daddy
[3:56] is wear the people out they're wore out
[3:58] any house they've been sitting there for
[4:00] hours you preach so long and I said well
[4:03] son I'm going to try to make it in
[4:04] Chicago meeting I said I'm going to set
[4:07] my watch at every 20 minutes and I what
[4:10] it alarms I'm going to quit right then
[4:12] and call the prayer and he said uh you
[4:15] might as well not said it because it a
[4:16] go you know it went off two or three
[4:18] times and just alarmed itself down I
[4:20] never did know I'm making so much noise
[4:22] up here I didn't even hear it when it
[4:24] went off and so I I just have to um just
[4:29] I hope I don't bore you you know I don't
[4:32] I don't come here for that I I come and
[4:35] I love him so much and know we've got so
[4:38] much that ought to be done right at this
[4:40] time and I just try to push too much of
[4:42] it in one night you see and not knowing
[4:45] just what time that we're going to be
[4:47] called away and then I think well I
[4:50] don't know what time I'm going to be
[4:52] called away and none of us know that and
[4:54] so we just might as well do what we can
[4:58] while we can do it
[5:01] I've heard my mother I never was had a
[5:03] dance in my life but I heard only a holy
[5:07] dance one time in church I never forget
[5:10] that when we were still a Baptist Church
[5:12] I would always criticized and kind of in
[5:15] my heart I wouldn't say it out loud
[5:17] because I I'd be afraid to do that
[5:19] anything that God does I always kind of
[5:22] thought it kind of strange to see I see
[5:24] him first got acquainted with the
[5:25] Pentecostal people see him dance you
[5:28] know dance around
[5:30] I thought you know that ain't in the
[5:32] Bible what what are they dancing about
[5:35] and then one night I was teaching from a
[5:37] chart on Daniel and Revelations it was
[5:39] New Year's night I was going to uh teach
[5:42] on the chart until midnight wasn't a
[5:44] chart like a Blackboard I was teaching
[5:46] and and uh there was a some Pentecostal
[5:49] people had come from Louisville they had
[5:51] a oh some sisters a sister a pastor at a
[5:55] church over there and she had a they had
[5:57] washboards and Thimbles and and all
[6:00] kinds of little things to make rackets
[6:02] with and and they uh all got it
[6:04] harmonizing some way I don't know what
[6:06] it was and they and she started playing
[6:08] the piano and all these girls up there
[6:10] got to hit with these Thimbles on
[6:11] washboards and things and and they they
[6:14] got this playing that song there's going
[6:17] to be a meeting in the air and the Sweet
[6:19] By and By or something well that little
[6:21] girl that was playing little lady
[6:24] pastored she just turned white all just
[6:28] like a chalk and she just begin to play
[6:31] it in such a way I don't I never see
[6:32] anything play like it in my life and I
[6:35] thought now what's that and then one on
[6:38] the washboard she got to doing the same
[6:40] thing then here two or three got up and
[6:42] a little blond head got to dancing right
[6:45] in the floor I oh
[6:48] man right up and down the floor as hard
[6:50] as she could go just dancing away like
[6:52] that little old girl about 16 18 years
[6:56] old I was just a young fell myself H Now
[7:00] isn't that something right you're in my
[7:02] church how I'll ever live that down see
[7:04] I'm watching her like that and I what do
[7:06] they do that for why they have to do
[7:08] that why could they just played their
[7:09] music and went on and let it alone like
[7:11] that I well that's terrible I got
[7:14] thinking now in the Bible is there such
[7:16] a thing as dancing and I remember that
[7:19] David danced around the ark when he saw
[7:22] the ark coming see he danced before the
[7:24] Lord and the Lord said he's a man after
[7:26] my own heart I thought well now that's
[7:29] he what did he dance for well they had a
[7:32] victory and Mariam when they crossed
[7:34] over the Red Sea Moses sang in the
[7:38] spirit and miam took a tambourine begin
[7:40] to beat it and they went down along the
[7:42] bank all the daughters of Israel dancing
[7:44] in the spirit and I seen that dancing
[7:47] was when they had Victory I thought God
[7:50] thinking well maybe I haven't got
[7:51] Victory
[7:53] enough I got thinking about it you know
[7:56] after a while I got the Pat in my foot
[7:58] and before I knowed I was out there
[8:00] dancing with that girl
[8:02] [Music]
[8:06] out I was marked then I can just see the
[8:10] expression on those people's face yet
[8:12] seeing their
[8:13] Pastor on the floor of this that little
[8:15] girl dancing around here I was right out
[8:17] there too I never was on a dance floor
[8:19] in my life and but I'd had to take it
[8:22] back and say it was on that one but that
[8:24] was a church floor so when we U you know
[8:28] all the devils God he he he copied it
[8:30] after some real thing that God's got
[8:33] that's all just exactly the devil cannot
[8:36] create he's just a perverter of what's
[8:38] been created you see so he cannot create
[8:41] he's not a Creator he's a perverter what
[8:44] is what is unrighteousness is
[8:46] righteousness perverted see it's uh
[8:49] legal for a man to take a wife and and
[8:52] be a a a husband to her and family
[8:55] relationship but the same woman another
[8:57] woman on the same Act
[9:00] condemn him and send his soul away see
[9:02] it's wrong what is it righteousness
[9:04] perverted see and it's the truth is
[9:07] always right what is a lie is the truth
[9:10] perverted see makes a lie so that's
[9:12] where all sin is is righteousness
[9:15] perverted so when I used hear my mother
[9:19] say she used to go to dances the old her
[9:22] and Daddy on them kind of see they had
[9:25] the old Fiddler would come stand on the
[9:26] corner and play the fiddle and them
[9:29] Kentucky people and pop he didn't have
[9:31] any money you know supposed to have a
[9:32] little money to Jingle your pockets and
[9:34] I se him go out the CAG and get some
[9:35] Nails in his pocket you know dance
[9:38] around he and Mama and they'd win prizes
[9:41] I can see her pull a skirt out like this
[9:42] you know and that jig dance you know
[9:44] ride around around one another like that
[9:45] I'd see Pop I thought that's that's bad
[9:48] pop and Nails that's not money you see I
[9:50] know he didn't have any money he had
[9:51] some Nails in his pocket jingling up and
[9:53] down like that and they do that come on
[9:56] till around daylight and some of the
[9:58] people leave home the all the all
[10:00] Kentucky people come over and they have
[10:02] the dances from one house to the other
[10:05] and then they go home of a morning
[10:07] packing their shoes in their hands C
[10:09] their feet was so sore from dancing well
[10:11] if you can do that for the devil then
[10:13] why not stand let's preach all night and
[10:15] praise God and get in the spirit and see
[10:18] sure if that if that's for Eternal
[10:21] separation what about eternal life let's
[10:24] we can appreciate this as much more than
[10:26] we should that of course but San wear us
[10:29] out on this right quick or tell us was
[10:31] was too tired but I tell you he's had an
[10:34] awful time with me G we out on it I
[10:36] remember when I was healed of stomach
[10:38] trouble eat Satan said well you better
[10:41] not eat said because the doctor said if
[10:43] you eat you'd die you had an ulcer
[10:45] stomach and said it just one big bloody
[10:47] ulcer but the Lord said he healed me so
[10:50] I had to take somebody's word so I I
[10:52] took God's word and so oh I'd like to
[10:55] Burnt me up I would just hot water
[10:57] running out of my mouth and so two or
[10:59] three days I was going around holding my
[11:01] stomach like this said how you feeling
[11:02] Mr brandom I said oh I feel fine hamping
[11:05] away like that someone said you lied I
[11:07] did not I was making a confession
[11:10] confess means say the same thing by
[11:12] Stripes I was healed so that's that does
[11:15] it see I was making confession and so
[11:18] Satan said to me said you're bringing
[11:20] reproach I said now look here old
[11:22] God if if you enjoy hearing me testify
[11:25] you stick around but if you don't you
[11:27] might as well get away
[11:29] I'm going to testify anyhow so that's it
[11:32] you just got to let him know what side
[11:33] you're standing on and then make your
[11:35] stand and then stand and that's just the
[11:38] way we got to do always is get where we
[11:40] know that we're right and then got faith
[11:43] in that you can't have faithless you
[11:45] know you're right don't you try to do
[11:47] that to Bluff him now he won't take your
[11:49] bluff see don't Bluff him but when you
[11:51] really believe it you're not bluffing
[11:53] then something's already witnessed to
[11:55] you then you then you're right I don't
[11:58] care you might might not no one never
[11:59] lay hands on you you might not never
[12:02] hear uh anything but just as long as
[12:05] something has confirmed it in your heart
[12:07] that it's God's word and God's will for
[12:10] you that's all is
[12:12] necessary and many times these gifts and
[12:14] things they just encourage I'm watching
[12:17] a Baptist preacher sitting here in front
[12:18] of me tonight if I'm not mistaken is
[12:21] this Mr Dalton sitting here from
[12:22] Somerset Kentucky I thought it was I
[12:26] remember brother Ed
[12:27] Dal oh my bapst right and he um come up
[12:33] and but he believed and come up to the
[12:35] church receive the Holy Ghost went back
[12:38] down and of course all of his
[12:39] neighborhood let him down as usual and
[12:42] so then when the Holy Spirit to come and
[12:45] on the what we're looking for to happen
[12:48] at any time now
[12:51] another gift that's going to be added to
[12:53] the church and uh it's a marvelous thing
[12:57] and we probably you've read read the
[12:59] articles in our uh religious papers
[13:01] about it about the squirrels and so
[13:04] forth and brother Dalton had two
[13:07] children well I think how many about
[13:10] eight children I think nine children
[13:13] nine children and uh teenagers and you
[13:17] know how they are kind of and a poor
[13:19] father and mother how they prayed so
[13:21] hard that God save their children one
[13:24] day at the Tabernacle he had seen the
[13:26] Holy Spirit speak to a woman and tell
[13:29] her just ask what you will right now and
[13:33] God told me to give you he said what
[13:35] must I ask I said you got a crippled
[13:37] sister sitting here has been crippled
[13:38] from birth and there's a man sitting
[13:41] here tonight Banks Woods who's sitting
[13:43] right with me the woman's name is Mrs
[13:45] wri and I said you got an age father and
[13:48] mother you're living on less than $200 a
[13:52] year on that little poor farm over there
[13:54] a widow woman I said there's many things
[13:57] you could ask for sister hadie but
[13:59] I said the very God that told me about
[14:01] those squirrels when I spoke those
[14:03] squirrels are standing right there and
[14:06] did that seven straight times standing
[14:09] right there where you look and see it
[14:10] when it's just impossible for one to be
[14:12] sitting on the wall there just to
[14:14] confirming something and I said he tells
[14:17] me to have you to ask what you will he
[14:21] said you asked it for me to say it she
[14:24] said well what should have say I said
[14:25] ask for whatever you will it'll be given
[14:28] right here if it isn't then I I've told
[14:30] something
[14:31] wrong and she said well said I don't
[14:35] know what to ask brother brandom she
[14:36] said she had two teenage boys and talk
[14:39] about Renegades they were and so just
[14:43] giving her heartaches all the time poor
[14:45] little Widow and mother and so um her
[14:48] husband I'm married she to her husband
[14:51] and they were her husband had gotten
[14:52] killed on a tractor and those boys had
[14:55] just gone wild and she said well the
[14:58] salvation and my two boys I said I give
[15:00] you those two boys in the name of Jesus
[15:03] Christ and both of them fell across her
[15:05] lap come to Christ now brother Banks
[15:08] Woods is somewhere sitting here in this
[15:10] building tonight that was present to see
[15:12] that happen both them boys are find they
[15:14] taking feet washing all the time
[15:16] communing at church and when we're
[15:18] taking feet washing the ones washing the
[15:20] feet we lay our hands over on them and
[15:22] pray that little fellow the other night
[15:24] about 14 years old our pastor brother
[15:26] Neville had his handling on praying the
[15:28] cutest little thing so brother Ed Dalton
[15:31] seen that happen he was praying for his
[15:33] children got outside and he turned back
[15:36] around and the Holy Spirit said speak
[15:39] for Ed's children and I said brother
[15:43] Dalton the Holy Spirit tells me by that
[15:47] same gift that we're looking to be
[15:49] perfectly manifested soon I give you
[15:52] your children in the name of Jesus
[15:56] Christ and when he got home there his
[15:58] daughter daughter and sons already give
[16:00] their hearts to Christ it's a few miles
[16:02] down in country from me and I think
[16:04] every one of your children is saved and
[16:06] filled with the Holy Spirit ready is
[16:08] that right brother D is there any of
[16:10] them with
[16:12] you one daughter was that the one was
[16:14] saved right away the oldest the next
[16:17] morning the oldest daughter was saved
[16:19] the next morning and every one of his
[16:21] children is now saved how the Holy
[16:24] Spirit When God says anything he keeps
[16:26] his word see now how could I save those
[16:31] children see it it isn't if it's not
[16:33] your own words if it isn't your own
[16:36] thinking then it's it's ever what's
[16:38] inspiring you and if it's God then it's
[16:41] God's word see so that's way on the
[16:44] meetings here at night when you see
[16:46] those things happening that's not me I
[16:49] couldn't do that it's God doing that and
[16:52] if you just believe it then that's all
[16:54] you have to do is just just believe it

[18:47] want to refer to I got some wrote out
[18:49] here and some pages here and I want to
[18:53] start tonight and read first a scripture
[18:56] found in St Luke 8:50
[18:59] for a a text and my subject tonight is
[19:04] the theme song they sang just before I
[19:06] come in only
[19:09] believe and uh uh St Luke 8 uh chapter
[19:14] and the 50th
[19:17] verse but when Jesus heard it he
[19:21] answered him saying fear not believe
[19:25] only and she shall shall be made
[19:30] whole let us bow our heads just a moment
[19:33] for prayer gracious God who brought
[19:37] again the lord Jesus thy son from the
[19:40] dead and has presented him to us after
[19:44] 2,000 years we see him day after day and
[19:49] night after night in The Invisible body
[19:53] of his working in the visible body of
[19:55] his church bringing to pass his words
[19:59] and as we was speaking the other night
[20:03] you're right on schedule everything's
[20:05] hitting just right God's great time
[20:07] clock's ticking just to the moment then
[20:10] tonight when we see that that last
[20:13] midnight stroke is fixing to strike oh
[20:18] great Jehovah God be merciful to us and
[20:23] as I think tonight here before me
[20:25] holding the purchase of your blood there
[20:28] attention for the next 30 or 40 minutes
[20:30] what must I say oh God these few words
[20:34] that's been prepared would be
[20:36] insufficient Lord without your anointing
[20:40] so I pray that you'll anoint the words
[20:42] tonight of this text and may they find
[20:45] their resting place and provide for us
[20:48] just what we have need of to be prepared
[20:52] for that hour and Jesus does come
[20:55] because God noticed when my eyes open a
[20:59] few moments ago laying here before me is
[21:03] that book of the Christian businessman
[21:06] where our precious brother Tommy Nichols
[21:09] translated from that
[21:11] tape that Vision or whatever it was Lord
[21:14] you let me see across the curtain
[21:17] there oh God I said if I could only go
[21:20] back for a i I'd persuade I'd beg people
[21:23] oh they mustn't miss that Lord there's
[21:26] people here that's divided living with
[21:30] me for me and my children between them
[21:33] and their children I pray God that
[21:36] somehow another something can might be
[21:38] said tonight that that we might have
[21:41] Christ divided among us tonight that he
[21:44] might be the savior of every one of us
[21:46] and the Healer of every one of us and
[21:48] our coming King and that hope leave here
[21:51] in our hearts may we live eternally with
[21:55] him over in that land where there's no
[21:57] sickness
[21:58] I can think of them women how they were
[22:01] once recognize them here as old women 90
[22:04] years old and there they was beautiful
[22:06] and young and those gray-headed man here
[22:08] on Earth there they was young and in
[22:11] there's youth for eternity God we
[22:14] couldn't afford to miss that Grant Lord
[22:17] tonight that each and every person will
[22:19] take new hold tonight bless the Saints
[22:21] and heal the sick for we commit
[22:23] ourselves with this text in the name of
[22:26] Jesus Christ for thy Glory amen
[22:36] amen Jesus had just been turned down
[22:41] from a great
[22:42] Revival he was always about the father's
[22:46] business I I like
[22:48] that we me myself I have so much time
[22:52] that I'm I think I I foolishly
[22:56] use and uh all of us feel that way and
[22:59] we uh get so wound up till we got to go
[23:03] somewhere and
[23:05] unwind but we have found Jesus always
[23:08] about the father's business I love that
[23:12] and that's the way we should be we
[23:15] should never be idling our time what
[23:18] time we have we must spend it for and
[23:21] and conserve the time redeem it because
[23:25] it is precious every time we get a
[23:27] chance to put in a plug for Jesus do it
[23:31] every time we get to put in a plug for
[23:32] God do it do something for the church
[23:35] and for EMB betterment of people many
[23:38] people that's how we come to know these
[23:41] things is by what somebody's told us and
[23:44] Jesus had left Galilee over in the land
[23:49] that he came from and crossed over the
[23:53] sea feeling LED no doubt to go over to
[23:58] Gia for
[24:00] Revival no doubt but what the father had
[24:03] led him over across the sea to gatera
[24:08] and you we all know the story that there
[24:11] was only one person
[24:14] saved that was a
[24:17] maniac uh in
[24:19] gadera and he was out into the fields
[24:22] and the cemetery he would went wild and
[24:26] they pluck chain on him and the demon
[24:29] power could break the chains and and
[24:33] I've often thought at going around
[24:35] insane institutions and watch a person
[24:38] who's uh been possessed with those evil
[24:42] Powers how strong they are they take a
[24:46] policeman sometime to beat them down
[24:49] remember down in Florida one night a man
[24:52] that wouldn't have weighed over 120 lb
[24:54] whip five policemen just as easy as
[24:56] you'd whip your child
[24:58] and um and then when that evil spirit
[25:00] went off of him while there was nothing
[25:03] harling just as Meek as he could be but
[25:06] it was the evil spirit and I thought if
[25:09] a man possessed with an evil spirit
[25:11] could break chains what could he do if
[25:14] he's completely surrendered to God with
[25:16] the power of God possessing him like
[25:18] that he could straighten every crippled
[25:21] leg and uh do great things if he could
[25:24] just be so Anointed with God's power as
[25:28] the devil could completely uh get a hold
[25:31] of him did you notice that devil was so
[25:34] completely a hold to that man until he
[25:38] he even confessed Jesus said we know who
[25:41] you are the Holy One Of God why cometh
[25:43] to torment us before our time comes see
[25:47] he was so completely surrendered to the
[25:49] devil until the devil could use his
[25:51] tongue and you know I like that I hope
[25:54] this don't hurt nobody's feelings but we
[25:56] can get so completely surr to God that
[25:58] he can use our tongue
[25:59] too to speak in other languages and to
[26:02] preach the gospel to sing the gospel to
[26:05] speak visions that we're looking at and
[26:08] the mysteries of God if we just
[26:10] completely surrender to the power of God
[26:13] that's all and if the devil can get a
[26:16] man under his control and do that what
[26:18] can do God do with one get one under his
[26:20] control so this maniac and you notice
[26:24] when Jesus was crossing the sea the
[26:26] devil know that he was on the road to a
[26:29] great win a great victory for God and he
[26:31] tried to drown him that night caused a
[26:34] storm to come up and but Jesus know that
[26:36] God had sent him because he did only
[26:39] what God led him to do wouldn't that be
[26:41] nice if we had a testimony like that
[26:43] Brethren I do only that which pleases
[26:46] God that be Wonder like Enoch walked
[26:48] with God 500 years and had a testimony
[26:51] that he pleased God he didn't have to
[26:53] die just went up so then uh uh little
[26:57] afternoon stroll he just started walking
[26:59] out and just thought well I've been on
[27:01] Earth long enough I'll just walk on up
[27:02] and just started by faith he thought
[27:04] well I've been here long enough so I'm
[27:06] kind of tired of being around you think
[27:07] of just stroll on up till hit the milky
[27:09] white way and just walk on up knock on
[27:11] the door so that's what he did see by
[27:14] faith he did it the Bible said so see he
[27:16] just got T stand here he said well I'm
[27:18] just going to walk up home God just went
[27:20] on up through the air walking he did
[27:22] that by faith the Bible said he did and
[27:25] so oh I I when I feel death come
[27:29] knocking around my door I I want to have
[27:31] that kind of Faith don't you just say
[27:33] well so long world I'm going to walk
[27:35] away from you now just start walking on
[27:38] just walk right on up and face the moon
[27:40] and stars and strike the milky white way
[27:42] and go on into the Spheres and spheres
[27:44] and out of the Spheres and just go on
[27:46] into Glory that's right and then um we
[27:50] find out that the devil can't destroy
[27:53] God's servant as long as he's in the
[27:54] will of God so he's we see him rise up
[27:58] that night and the devil all so angry
[28:00] and go to try to drown him out there on
[28:02] the sea raised up and he said why are
[28:05] you so fearful you think I'd be doing
[28:07] anything L is in the will of God why you
[28:10] so scared about why are you worried
[28:13] about anyhow yeah why are you all upset
[28:16] that's the same thing he'd say to us
[28:18] tonight brother I imagine why are you so
[28:20] scared about see what's the matter are
[28:22] you afraid to trust me he said peace be
[28:25] still and the winds and the waves obeyed
[28:28] him crossed over the sea oh how
[28:32] beautiful there he got on the other side
[28:34] and this Maniac met him and and when he
[28:37] did he was go to come out to tear him to
[28:39] pieces and then the devil found out that
[28:41] that was little more than a man coming
[28:43] walking up there with those other 12 men
[28:46] and then when he confessed him to be the
[28:49] Son of God and confessed that he is
[28:51] future torment Jesus said hold your
[28:54] peace but come out of him and he
[28:57] delivered that man of those Legions of
[29:01] devils and those Devils went over and
[29:04] they got if they're not embodied they're
[29:06] they're seem to be helpless so they went
[29:09] over and got a bunch of hogs and went
[29:10] out 2,000 Hogs and drowned in the sea
[29:14] and you know what Jesus come over to uh
[29:17] hold a Revival but when those people
[29:20] realize there go to cost them 2,000 Hogs
[29:22] they didn't want the Revival so if it's
[29:25] going to cost them anything they don't
[29:26] want nothing to do with it so that's
[29:28] about the way it is today you know if
[29:29] it's going to cost you a few hours sleep
[29:31] or or something other the people don't
[29:34] want to do nothing with it you know and
[29:36] so they said well they instead of having
[29:39] the Revival they come out the people of
[29:41] the city and said leave our country we
[29:44] never we don't want you over here just
[29:46] get on out we and you know and Jesus
[29:48] looked around to the man was in his
[29:50] right mind and had clothes on and if you
[29:53] know I always thought
[29:55] there I very not start on that
[29:58] I if you see that man he started putting
[30:02] on cloth when he met Jesus and how is it
[30:05] we claim we know him and Tak them off
[30:07] all the time so there's and that's um
[30:11] they say we're crazy for preaching such
[30:13] things as that but I don't know the man
[30:15] that had was naked was one was crazy
[30:17] according to the Bible so when he found
[30:21] Jesus went putting his clothes back on
[30:22] again so so we find out that I've often
[30:26] wondered when I up to heaven I want to
[30:28] find that man and I I want to go over
[30:31] Jesus wouldn't let him follow him he
[30:32] said you go on back and show the people
[30:34] over there what's happened to you and I
[30:36] just wonder what uh what weight his
[30:39] testimony had on hog raising in that
[30:41] country after that I just wondered what
[30:44] what his testimony had what weight it
[30:46] had over there but they didn't want him
[30:49] so I'll say one thing if you don't want
[30:51] him he won't bore you with himself no no
[30:55] he won't push yourself on he never did
[30:57] he knocks you're on the inside you're
[30:59] the one opens the door but he'll knock
[31:02] he'll give you the opportunity so then
[31:04] uh oh they said we don't want you I
[31:07] don't care how many you can deliver and
[31:08] how what who sent you over here if God
[31:10] sent you over about it we just don't
[31:12] want any of that kind of stuff going
[31:13] over here around ours you get her people
[31:15] all confused so you just get back where
[31:17] you belong you said all right I don't
[31:19] back you went and got in the boat it
[31:22] must have been along about 10:00 in the
[31:25] morning our little brother
[31:28] Jas he was a he was a Believer he he
[31:33] actually was a Believer but he was kind
[31:35] of a secret believer and you know we got
[31:38] a whole lot of those out here in these
[31:39] Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian
[31:41] churches they really believe this
[31:42] message of Pentecost they do that they
[31:46] just can't do it on account of their
[31:48] church so jiah said is a secret believer
[31:52] outwardly he had jined himself up with a
[31:54] bunch of unbelievers and so that's why
[31:56] many good man is tonight Jared up with
[32:00] unbelievers and the Bible said do not be
[32:03] unequally yolked together don't yoke
[32:06] yourself up amongst unbelievers come out
[32:09] from amongst the unbelievers and
[32:10] separate yourself sayith God and I will
[32:13] receive you touch not their unclean
[32:15] things and I'll be God to you and you'll
[32:17] be Sons and Daughters unto me so J
[32:21] always like many of today had yoked
[32:24] himself up in an organization that he
[32:26] just simply couldn't wiggle away from
[32:29] because he had a high name perhaps let's
[32:32] call him a a doctor gir see he was a had
[32:37] a great name of doctor maybe behind it
[32:40] he was a priest and he is um is a pastor
[32:44] of a great synagogue but in his heart
[32:47] he'd followed Jesus of Nazareth he'd
[32:49] watched those Miracles he' go home and
[32:51] study and look through the scriptures
[32:53] and say that's just exactly that's think
[32:57] he was standing there that day when
[32:58] Simon come up he went out to hear John
[33:01] preach and he heard about he he him
[33:03] announce Jesus and seen this light come
[33:05] down over him there and settle down up
[33:07] on him and we seen that same light was
[33:09] on him tell that old fisherman why your
[33:12] name is Simon and you're the son of
[33:14] Jonas maybe you know his father was a
[33:18] might have been a member of this man's
[33:20] synagogue he said uh I know that man
[33:23] didn't know him and I went home and
[33:24] search that out in the scripture and I
[33:26] found out that that that was the sign of
[33:28] the Messiah and then when I was standing
[33:30] there I I was standing over on the other
[33:32] side of course as the priest and my
[33:34] brethren and listen to see what I could
[33:36] hear saying the Brethren they said what
[33:38] are we going to do when we go back when
[33:40] Philip come up and had Nathaniel and
[33:42] that Jesus stood there and told
[33:44] Nathaniel who he was and where he found
[33:46] him and so forth like that and we seen
[33:48] Nathaniel or he was maybe studying to be
[33:51] a preacher and he said why Rabbi you're
[33:53] the Son of God the king of Israel he
[33:55] said Do you believe because of told you
[33:57] that and maybe he was sitting out there
[33:59] also to hear the woman at the well and
[34:02] and stand at the gate that time when
[34:03] blind Barney mayus is out there crying
[34:06] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[34:08] he couldn't have touched him if you go
[34:10] if you ever's that the place in Mark
[34:11] where barus is setting and where Jesus
[34:14] was when he called him oh my all that
[34:16] mob howling saying say tell me you
[34:19] raised the dead we got a graveyard full
[34:21] of them up here come up raise some of
[34:22] them we'll believe you see how could he
[34:24] ever hurt all but is faith touched him
[34:28] like a little zachus that I told of the
[34:30] Christian businessman sitting up in the
[34:32] tree like that said H Rebecca told me
[34:35] that he he know all things and could God
[34:38] spoke through him and he was Messiah so
[34:39] I pull all these limbs around me and and
[34:42] you'll never know I'm sitting up here so
[34:44] when Jesus stopped around the tree and
[34:45] looked up and said zachus come down
[34:48] going home with you so maybe he was
[34:50] there that morning and see that however
[34:53] he believed through the scriptures that
[34:55] that was the Messiah
[34:57] and but yet he couldn't make a
[34:59] confession because the the Ministerial
[35:02] Association uh of gatera had said this
[35:05] if there's anybody ever t one of them
[35:08] revivals that that prophet of Galilee
[35:10] over there holds will excommunicating
[35:13] that hour from the church so well he he
[35:16] had a pastor and he had a big
[35:18] congregation and a nice bunch of people
[35:21] and and he know he loved the Lord but
[35:23] right down in his heart he know there
[35:25] was something else ought to be asked
[35:28] oh zachus I hope you're sitting here
[35:30] tonight and don't get up and go out till
[35:32] this is over see U just set still for a
[35:36] minute and there he was you know out
[35:38] there believing that and come home by
[35:40] the little uh Candlelight and study
[35:43] through the night when he'd go to one of
[35:44] those meetings and listen Maybe disguise
[35:46] himself and put a veil over his face or
[35:49] something so he wouldn't be know as a
[35:51] doctor z uh Dr Jas you know he just
[35:55] wouldn't want to be known amongst the
[35:57] crowd but yet he was sitting there and
[35:59] he watched this and he studied it but
[36:01] yet he couldn't openly publicly confess
[36:03] him because he'd have to give up his
[36:05] Ministerial Association and his
[36:06] fellowship with his Brethren and that's
[36:08] the reason all of them together run
[36:10] Jesus out of gader and put him back over
[36:12] his own country in his own country had
[36:14] been the same thing and uh anybody join
[36:18] themselves with this uh so-called
[36:20] prophet of Galilee while I was had to be
[36:23] excommunicated but you know God's got a
[36:26] way of bringing that real genuine Faith
[36:29] out in
[36:30] us God has peculiar ways of doing it and
[36:34] so um let's say one night uh the little
[36:37] girl had come in and she he had one
[36:39] little daughter about 12 years old and
[36:41] he was getting aged and as the only
[36:43] child he and his wife had one night she
[36:45] came in from skipping the Rope or
[36:47] something around the parish and she came
[36:50] in she said Daddy I am so sick so he
[36:53] felt her little head and he said yes
[36:55] honey you are sick
[36:57] so he said mother I tell you what you
[36:59] put her to bed and we'll go down and get
[37:01] the doctor that's the only sensible
[37:03] thing to do so they went and got the
[37:05] good doctor from the neighborhood and he
[37:07] came up and he failed her and he said
[37:10] yes she's burning with fever so he
[37:12] doctored her for two or three days and U
[37:16] come to find out her fever grew worse oh
[37:20] got in such a place to it got so hot
[37:24] that he was getting the doctor got weed
[37:26] about it so he tried all the herbs and
[37:29] all the remedies that he know to try to
[37:32] help this uh little girl but he he
[37:35] couldn't do no good with it he just
[37:36] couldn't break the fever so then one uh
[37:41] morning about 9:00 while he had come to
[37:43] visit the little girl actually had been
[37:45] up almost all night and all the loving
[37:48] people of the churches gathered in there
[37:50] and all the associate pastors and some
[37:53] of the visiting clergymen and the
[37:55] district pter and all of them was
[37:56] sitting close you know to to to offer
[37:59] prayer and he examined the little girl
[38:02] taking her pulse and oh the fever was
[38:04] raging the little thing was beyond out
[38:06] of her head now so he knew that the end
[38:09] was close he hated to tell the pastor
[38:11] perhaps went to his own church so he
[38:15] called him out to one side and said now
[38:18] D I want to tell you out your so sister
[38:21] won't hear it that baby is dying your
[38:25] only little girl oh doctor surely
[38:30] there's something else you can do no D
[38:33] if if you want to call another doctor
[38:36] and consult the case why it's all right
[38:39] but as far as my uh medical uh
[38:43] understanding deaths on the child right
[38:45] now because she's laying at the point of
[38:48] death and she probably won't last over
[38:52] another hour or two the good doctor was
[38:54] telling all that he know to be the truth
[38:57] and said Doctor would you advise uh me
[38:59] to get some other doctor he said you're
[39:01] welcome but he said I don't know no
[39:03] other doctor we know there was a doctor
[39:05] over across the uh there called Loop Dr
[39:09] Loop but you know he uh he was converted
[39:12] oh don't you Luke's went off on the
[39:14] wrong end see he's following that
[39:16] Galilean Prophet don't oh that brings it
[39:19] back to his mind yes doctor well thank
[39:21] you what do I owe you Doctor oh well uh
[39:24] that's all right you don't have to pay
[39:25] me nothing there a buying man see you go
[39:27] ahead preacher I know you don't make
[39:28] much money so just let it go well thank
[39:31] you very kindly now what's he going to
[39:33] do he walks back from the gate and said
[39:35] I'll go in the house there in the parish
[39:37] and why don't how I go tell my wife that
[39:39] that baby's landing at the point of
[39:41] death and I've kept it a secret from her
[39:43] all the time that I really believed in
[39:45] Jesus being that real Prophet was to
[39:47] come but now how would I ever get it
[39:49] there as a district presor and all the
[39:51] rest of Ministerial Association sitting
[39:53] around in the house there and how can I
[39:55] ever and wonder where he's at so he goes
[39:58] back in the room and begins to wonder
[40:00] and you know and first thing you know he
[40:02] calls his wife in he said dear come in
[40:04] and sit down just a minute he put his
[40:06] hand said I've got something I want to
[40:08] talk to you about first I want to say
[40:11] mother do you remember how that I've set
[40:14] up here at night time these candle

[43:24] him and he was over and G
[43:26] and they I heard by a courier that
[43:28] they're coming in today they're supposed
[43:30] to land this morning down there at the
[43:31] fishing dock I can see a little uh D
[43:35] going out and get his little priest hat
[43:37] and putting it on putting his coat on
[43:38] start out I hear the district presor
[43:41] stand door look here young man uh you've
[43:44] been one of us for a long time now if
[43:46] you're going to start such as that and
[43:48] mix up our congregation bring such
[43:50] fanaticism as that in our group you know
[43:52] what's going to happen we're going to
[43:54] excommunicate you we're going to take
[43:57] our name right off the boat that's all
[44:00] well I can hear his little heart sinking
[44:02] like that look around his wife and she's
[44:03] standing see what he's going to say and
[44:04] look over and see his little dying
[44:06] daughter he said you just might as well
[44:08] take her off cuz here I go that's right
[44:10] I'm all he had a need rushing he must go
[44:15] right now they said remember if you go
[44:18] you know what's going to happen you know
[44:20] our declaration yes I understand all
[44:22] about it but I've got a dying child here
[44:26] and the very thing is I've hidden my
[44:28] heart all time I've searched the
[44:30] scriptures I've tended his meeting under
[44:32] disguising and I've checked the
[44:34] scriptures and he is the Messiah amen
[44:36] that's it amen that's the way now you're
[44:39] coming to a dra turn right out and tell
[44:41] them what's right confess your faith
[44:43] then you're getting your right on the
[44:44] right path then it it isn't kind of
[44:47] gloomy looking oh uh he said the church
[44:51] said now you remember if you do well
[44:54] what's going to happen but Ji had a need
[44:57] the need and brother if there ever was a
[45:00] time brother that we ought to make our
[45:02] confession that he is the Messiah the
[45:05] Son of God that he is
[45:08] alive that his power is just the same
[45:11] there's a need today today is the
[45:15] hour people are
[45:18] dying people are dying in the churches
[45:21] people are the Pentecostal churches
[45:24] dying it's going so farmal it's getting
[45:27] out away from God if there's any time to
[45:30] step out and say we are dying let's get
[45:33] back to God it's right now because
[45:35] there's a
[45:37] need come back to the faith that was
[45:39] once delivered to the Saints right I
[45:42] know there's a lot of fanaticism I'll
[45:44] realize that as I said at the
[45:46] ministerial breakfast the other morning
[45:47] you can't hardly blame pastors but
[45:49] remember every time you see something
[45:52] false a bogus dollar it's just as sure
[45:55] as anything the world it's made off of a
[45:58] real I never was so surprised one time I
[46:01] was going up the road and I seen a a a
[46:03] big bunch of crows or blackbirds they
[46:06] were just having their office squalling
[46:08] time I thought what's the matter with
[46:10] them I walked on up the road and there
[46:12] some of us in trees and some on
[46:13] Telegraph poles and some sitting on
[46:15] fences although what some artha birds
[46:18] there was a a strawberry patch across
[46:20] the the field and the man that owned the
[46:23] patch had went to Florida for a vacation
[46:25] and he he just let those strawberries
[46:26] there wouldn't let no one pick them
[46:28] because he he liked to he kept them
[46:30] there for the birds he just loved to
[46:32] watch The Birds And so while he was gone
[46:34] down in Florida on a vacation watch
[46:36] somebody come over there put a big old
[46:37] scarecrow up in the field and wanted to
[46:39] pick the strawberries and sa not let the
[46:41] birds happen the birds was all excited
[46:43] oh my they were so excited some of them
[46:46] sitting way off in a tree looking all
[46:48] for on them scar curls and just just
[46:50] chirping and chirping and going on some
[46:52] sitting down the telegraph poles and
[46:53] some sitting on the fence poles I
[46:55] thought well now wonder what's the
[46:57] matter and I had the look setting right
[46:58] on the arms of those that old scarecrow
[47:01] said two big healthy Birds just eating
[47:03] as hard as they could
[47:05] eat I thought if that isn't a picture if
[47:08] that isn't something now I thought well
[47:10] what's the matter I walked up a little
[47:11] close and I look there's plenty
[47:13] strawberries I thought what's the matter
[47:15] fellas and that's the way some of them
[47:17] do some of them away go away back here
[47:19] they don't believe in the Holy Ghost or
[47:20] nothing some I come up and say well I
[47:22] believe in a good Sanctified life but I
[47:24] I I I just don't believe in Divine
[47:26] Healing but others will get right down
[47:28] almost to the borderline but they're
[47:30] afraid of the Scarecrow and that's just
[47:32] about where Pentecost has come now
[47:34] you're AF prid of the
[47:37] Scarecrow my brother a scarecrow is a
[47:39] meal ticket amen just get in behind the
[47:42] Scarecrow that's all you have to do if
[47:45] you see all kinds of false isms and
[47:47] things rise up when I said the other
[47:48] night all these isms will soon become
[47:50] WMS so don't worry about them but God's
[47:54] word will be true when when there's no
[47:56] more Heaven and Earth left it'll still
[47:58] be true yes sir there was no
[48:00] condemnation of them sitting there
[48:01] eating strawberries brother they were
[48:03] sitting there big healthy Birds just
[48:04] pecking away as hard as they could cuz
[48:06] they wasn't caring about the Scarecrow
[48:08] they they just eating strawberries just
[48:10] the same so that's what we should do
[48:12] when you see these things that you get
[48:15] everybody's talking so well and the
[48:16] church getting classical and the Big
[48:19] Fellas saying well well we'll just take
[48:20] them into this and that you better be
[48:22] careful brother there's something wrong
[48:23] there somewhere there's something wrong
[48:25] I like to get where somebody's
[48:26] criticized and made fun of and look
[48:28] around and see where well examine it
[48:29] over and see what it's all about yes sir
[48:32] it's a dinner bell just watch right
[48:34] behind it remember the clubs always lays
[48:37] under the good apple tree they don't
[48:40] Club off them little old naughty draw up
[48:43] sour days of Miracles just past there's
[48:45] nothing Club in that just does go on but
[48:48] D had a need and he had a need because
[48:51] his only child was dying and that's the
[48:54] same thing it is tonight now now he
[48:55] didn't have to say now I'll wait now I
[48:58] probably maybe if I wait a little while
[49:00] uh I may go seem like Nicodemus did
[49:02] going to nighttime I slep over sometime
[49:04] at night I tell you uh told my told his
[49:07] wife something like this well now
[49:09] there's such a district preser out there
[49:10] and there such a bishop that's that's
[49:12] all the church and so forth I tell you
[49:14] I'll wait till it gets night and when it
[49:16] gets night I'll slip on my little mask
[49:18] again and I'll slip over to meeting and
[49:20] after it's over I won't let nobody know
[49:22] I slip around behind the building say
[49:24] say prophet of Galilee I believe in you
[49:26] I believe in you you come over here I
[49:27] got a sick daughter no the daughter was
[49:29] dying right then he had to go then it
[49:33] was time for
[49:35] action and it's time for Action Brethren
[49:38] it's not time to argue about whether we
[49:40] should be baptized face forward or
[49:42] backward where we should belong to this
[49:44] church or that church it's time for the
[49:46] Holy Spirit to come into the church and
[49:49] get in action it's later than you think
[49:53] the hour is here it's not time to fuss
[49:55] about Creeds and about doctrines and
[49:58] things like that it's time to get into
[50:00] God's spirit and move on because the
[50:02] atomic bombs are hanging missiles
[50:04] everywhere and spudniks in the skies and
[50:07] everything that Jesus said would take
[50:08] place before the end time has now taking
[50:11] place and the Holy Ghost is here Christ
[50:15] right on time on schedule Hallelujah yes
[50:19] the critics are
[50:20] rising I'm going to say this because it
[50:23] was I asked for to be obain one time and
[50:26] when they did the brother got real put
[50:28] out about it I was set cuz it's on tape
[50:31] and so our brother can hear it if he
[50:33] wants to get this tape is concerning
[50:35] Brother David dupes my precious brother
[50:39] friend I got a letter of criticism from
[50:41] me and uh I didn't want to read it
[50:43] secretary got it and so I I didn't want
[50:46] to read it because I withheld saying his
[50:49] name on a tape but this is tape the
[50:52] tapes are going here's exactly what I
[50:55] said
[50:56] I was preaching on the nearing outcoming
[50:58] of Christ and Brother David is dealing
[51:02] with the Presbyterians Methodist and
[51:04] Baptist and those great men that is his
[51:08] ministry to them God has sent him with
[51:11] the ministry David is a smart Theologian
[51:15] scholar and a wonderful man of God he's
[51:19] been with me in the meetings he stood by
[51:21] my side I love him as only a brother
[51:23] could love another and that is true but
[51:26] what I said about David and the church
[51:29] shall bear me witness I said it seems
[51:32] like that Brother David as spiritual as
[51:34] he is would wake up to the fact to know
[51:37] that he's dealing with the sleeping
[51:39] version and the Pentecostal people are
[51:41] so glad to see the Presbyterians write
[51:43] in a little declaration we got to go
[51:46] back to Divine healers we got to go back
[51:48] to speaking in tongues you've read the
[51:49] peace worthy F we got to go back and
[51:51] having healing Services Billy Graham
[51:53] talking we got to go back to pen call do
[51:56] you realize brother that the very hour
[51:59] that the went to wake the sleeping
[52:01] virgin up when she come to BU or that
[52:03] was when Jesus
[52:05] came I said I wonder if Brother David
[52:07] realizes that you think the Pentecostal
[52:10] Church they had their picture paper they
[52:11] have some Catholic priest standing
[52:13] blessing the Pentecostal businessman's
[52:15] breakfast or something and things like
[52:17] that which that's all right but I wonder
[52:18] if the church really realizes what it is
[52:22] it's a sign when that sleeping virgin
[52:25] come and knocked at the gate that's when
[52:27] she could not get in ver the bride was
[52:29] gone don't you
[52:31] see that's what I said about Brother
[52:34] David he not nothing concerning his work
[52:36] or his man about his uh reputation
[52:40] David's my brother and one of the finest
[52:42] godly man that I know of but I just
[52:45] wondered how that he he didn't pick that
[52:47] up to realize the very minute that
[52:49] outside denominational world begins to
[52:52] receive this message that's exactly the
[52:54] hour he's come
[52:56] when when they went to sleeping virgin
[52:58] realized she didn't have any oil in her
[53:00] lamp and when she come to knock on the
[53:02] door to get it that was exactly when the
[53:05] bride went out when the wise virgin left
[53:09] that's right they didn't get
[53:11] in no and them organizations won't come
[53:14] in they won't have the opportunity to
[53:18] time the message gets around the church
[53:19] will be gone so if they're trying to get
[53:21] in right now how close are we when we
[53:25] see as was in the days of Sodom so shall
[53:27] it be the coming of the son of man the
[53:29] very last message Abraham and his seat
[53:31] after him we see every Everything lays
[53:34] just a time we've got need it's time for
[53:37] action it's not wait till I go way to
[53:40] school and get me a PhD or lld it's get
[53:42] into the gospel right now
[53:46] preach yes get out there now and how's
[53:49] the
[53:50] hour D couldn't wait till tomorrow his
[53:53] child was dying
[53:56] bre we can't wait for a new
[53:59] organization we can't wait for something
[54:01] to gets turn up it's already here we've
[54:05] got to bring Christ on the scene the
[54:08] Pentecostal church is
[54:10] dying
[54:12] amen the assemblies the Oneness the Tess
[54:15] the
[54:16] threeness the the four square all of
[54:18] them they are
[54:21] dying let's leave these things they're
[54:23] all right but don't just quit fussing
[54:26] about that let's bring Christ on the
[54:29] scene that's way your eyes how to get
[54:32] Christ on the scene or his child would
[54:34] die he must hurry real quick he's got to
[54:37] spring into action oh I love that get
[54:41] into action oh if this group right here
[54:44] tonight you Methodist you Baptist you
[54:46] Presbyterian you Pentecostals oness Tess

[55:15] into the dock down there now just down
[55:17] below the Hill from the parish he's
[55:20] coming in down there now but here he
[55:23] goes he grabs his little hat and they
[55:25] don't care what they say say all right J
[55:27] you're going to be sorry one of these
[55:28] days you know you're springing off on
[55:30] the deep end he didn't care deep end or
[55:32] what in he know what his heart told him
[55:35] and there isn't a person in here tonight
[55:38] if you do what your heart told you to do
[55:40] you probably be this
[55:42] altar right there is a preacher peasant
[55:47] if you do what your heart told you to do
[55:49] but what we would confess are
[55:51] wrong it's
[55:54] right will you confess mine I'm ready to
[55:58] join arms and hearts with man to get
[56:02] Christ on the scene that's the main
[56:05] thing the children's dying this little
[56:08] book here holds that Vision in it now I
[56:11] looked over there they I did when I
[56:13] walked up the gate and then asked me if
[56:14] I was a Pentecostal Oneness or a
[56:17] threeness or Fess the only thing it was
[56:19] he just let me come in because I love
[56:22] Christ and had love in my heart that's
[56:25] the thing now

[56:37] might have called it telepathy you might
[56:39] have called it the devil you might don't
[56:40] know what you did call it but way down
[56:42] deep in your heart that if you believed
[56:44] it was a truth brother you better put
[56:46] your ecclesiastical hat in the corner
[56:48] and say something and get
[56:49] moving right the church is dying we need
[56:54] Christ on
[56:56] Time for Action not when I feel like it
[57:00] not when I take the next notion but it
[57:02] had to get people on the scene
[57:04] because the PE uh get Jesus on the scene
[57:08] everything else had failed I want to ask
[57:10] you something is the Pentecostal Church
[57:12] better off tonight because it's broke
[57:14] itself up in about 30 different
[57:15] organizations or when it started in the
[57:17] beginning see just ask that we're
[57:20] constantly getting worse and worse is
[57:23] the women and men in our Pentecostal
[57:25] churches looking more like Saints
[57:27] praying tell me somewhere in the city
[57:29] where they're having prayer meeting all
[57:31] night long day in and out for the sins
[57:33] that's done in the city like they used
[57:35] to do it are we any better we're getting
[57:38] worse oh our buildings are getting more
[57:40] pretty oh we're becoming more up in the
[57:42] ranks with the other churches but who
[57:44] wants to be like them I want to be like
[57:47] Jesus and that's why every man ought to
[57:49] want to be like
[57:51] Christ let's get him on the scene see
[57:55] and we the the the churches are dying so
[57:58] we've got to do something we got to
[57:59] hurry we ain't got we ain't got to wait
[58:02] till uh to the Millennium to do it if

[58:08] to happen here he goes I don't care his
[58:11] little face is red brother every time he

[58:25] on top of the hill and he had know it he
[58:28] had talked to her about it and she had
[58:30] said right out openly she said one time

[1:16:25] that God will cut away all the world and
[1:16:27] all the traditions of man and everything
[1:16:28] else and we can see Jesus and see him
[1:16:30] stand there in a pillar of fire going
[1:16:32] before performing The Works and doing
[1:16:34] exactly what God Said would do and bring
[1:16:37] forth a church filled with the Holy
[1:16:38] Ghost and doing the works that he said

[1:16:46] it yeah he put them out because he
[1:16:48] laughed at the word yeah and he got them
[1:16:50] all out and then Jesus was alone with
[1:16:53] what the Brokenhearted and the faithful
[1:16:56] he brought Peter James and John faith
[1:17:00] hope and
[1:17:01] charity put him in the building with him
[1:17:04] put the rest of them on the outside then
[1:17:06] Jesus was alone with the Brokenhearted
[1:17:09] Believers weeping because that they were
[1:17:12] their little girl was dead laying there
[1:17:13] the little thing is laid out a carps
[1:17:16] flowers laying around her put all the
[1:17:18] unbelievers out away from him like that

[1:17:27] this place it just it was terrible one
[1:17:30] of these nights I'm just going to reach
[1:17:31] right down and call them guys out
[1:17:33] hallelujah it's going to hurt a lot of
[1:17:35] feelings but it's good I used to do that
[1:17:37] all time and you know what but I I've
[1:17:40] restrained from it just because the
[1:17:41] feeling of the people because if you
[1:17:43] pluck up the uh the Terriers you get a
[1:17:46] lot of wheat too see so now it's too
[1:17:49] close to the end time now so we just go

[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:27] T I'm just going to tell you a little
[1:50:30] bit about my side of
[1:50:32] it I was having to wear shoes with
[1:50:36] special braces in
[1:50:38] them the only way I could walk
[1:50:40] comfortably was on the outside edges of
[1:50:42] my feet like
[1:50:45] this because my ankles would wouldn't
[1:50:49] support my way wait and they'd roll in
[1:50:51] the doctors had told Mom and Dad when I
[1:50:54] got to weigh 100 lb or so I'd have to
[1:50:56] get around on
[1:51:00] crutches I had gotten lost and my dad
[1:51:03] was working with a Pentecost preacher at
[1:51:05] General Motors and at Willis Springs
[1:51:08] Illinois Deb was one of those
[1:51:10] hillbillies that moved up north to get a
[1:51:13] job
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:18] and Pentecost preacher asked my dad he
[1:51:22] said what kind of music do you like to
[1:51:24] listen to and dad said well he said I
[1:51:27] like hillbilly music if it wasn't Lester
[1:51:30] flat and Earl scrug dad thought it was
[1:51:35] noise brother Migel you remember that
[1:51:38] name Mill you just saw it on the
[1:51:41] board that was our penos pastor's woman
[1:51:46] preacher
[1:51:47] wife that was called out just behind dad
[1:51:50] about me oh she had eczema in the ear it
[1:51:54] would it would crack open and bleed I I
[1:51:57] remembered that and and and she would
[1:51:59] limp sometimes from the arthritis
[1:52:04] but at any rate I got
[1:52:07] lost and uh this Minister had Pentecost
[1:52:12] preacher had asked Dad to come to church
[1:52:15] with him and for the first time in many
[1:52:19] years
[1:52:20] dad said the last time he remembered
[1:52:23] praying was in World War
[1:52:25] II tail Gunner on Navy
[1:52:31] airplane jet plane swung him behind him
[1:52:34] had him dead to
[1:52:35] right he said I watched him set down the
[1:52:39] triggers and he's gun
[1:52:44] jammed dad said I prayed them he didn't
[1:52:47] remember praying again till I got lost 3
[1:52:50] years old and
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:53] 58 he said
[1:52:55] Lord I showed the brothers I'm not going
[1:52:58] to do it to all of y'all but I've got a
[1:53:00] a birthmark tan that looks like two fish
[1:53:04] swimming side by side my birthday's
[1:53:06] February 23rd I'm born under the S of
[1:53:09] Pisces I love water they was digging
[1:53:12] ditches putting in sewer
[1:53:15] lines my dad was afraid that knowing how
[1:53:18] I loved water that I got down in one of
[1:53:21] them ditches and got drowned he said
[1:53:22] Lord if you let us find that boy
[1:53:25] alive I'll go to church with that
[1:53:32] man about 30 minutes later the police
[1:53:36] got a
[1:53:37] call there was a boy playing in the
[1:53:40] backyard with their kids and nobody knew
[1:53:42] who he
[1:53:44] was he fit my
[1:53:48] description please went by and got him
[1:53:50] took me home it was
[1:53:53] me but my daddy kept a promise to God
[1:53:57] Amen he and Mom were baptized in jesus'
[1:54:03] name in a little tank in the the
[1:54:07] back storage room of that church give
[1:54:11] their heart to the Lord my dad started
[1:54:14] studying his Bible so he had some
[1:54:16] questions about women preachers and uh
[1:54:19] told my dad said there's a man coming to
[1:54:22] Chicago said he some people calls him a
[1:54:25] prophet said he uh calls out people
[1:54:29] tells them what their name is what's
[1:54:31] wrong with them and said but the Lord
[1:54:33] has a mighty healing work said maybe you
[1:54:36] need to take Force to see
[1:54:39] him so Dad starts studying what a
[1:54:42] prophet
[1:54:43] is and he said about the first thing
[1:54:45] that really struck him was a prophet had
[1:54:49] only the the word of
[1:54:50] God and it always had to be right it
[1:54:53] couldn't be like Jane Dixon right uh or
[1:54:56] Jean Dixon right 67% of the
[1:55:01] time then my dad started telling people
[1:55:04] that he was going to go to that meeting
[1:55:06] when the man come up brother
[1:55:09] brandom and uh they said oh Glenn that's
[1:55:13] mind reading or it's mental telepathy so
[1:55:15] Dad got to reading up on that and mind
[1:55:18] reading was a high powerered guessing
[1:55:20] game they'd say key words see how you
[1:55:23] reacted to them words and then lead you
[1:55:25] on
[1:55:27] and dad said well if that's what it
[1:55:31] is I'll sit so far away that
[1:55:34] he I can't see how I respond to any
[1:55:38] keyword same thing with mental
[1:55:42] telepathy so we said in the back of an
[1:55:45] auditorium that holds about 1,500 people
[1:55:48] brother Scotty could I get you to take
[1:55:50] this around and maybe the the government
[1:55:53] wouldn't want us letting everybody
[1:55:56] handle it but
[1:56:01] uh you can see in the very
[1:56:06] back we sit on the next to the back row
[1:56:09] but right about the middle of the
[1:56:11] picture there's somebody there sitting
[1:56:14] with a something turquoise a shirt or
[1:56:17] blouse whatever it is we were sitting
[1:56:20] like right behind
[1:56:23] them and of course you heard what
[1:56:27] happened brother Bram said I take every
[1:56:29] spirit in here under my control we had
[1:56:33] no prayer card but there was none
[1:56:40] necessary there was none necessary
[1:56:42] really for that little girl that I told
[1:56:44] you about earlier because when she came
[1:56:47] up the prayer of faith had already been
[1:56:51] said but that night they took the
[1:56:55] special built shoes off of me I've never
[1:56:57] had on another pair of special built
[1:57:00] shoes Lord since then I've wore gym
[1:57:05] shoes Indian

[1:57:20] barefooted praise the Lord swim
[1:57:24] fins but no more special built shoes
[1:57:27] praise
[1:57:28] [Music]
[1:57:30] God the doctors told Mom and Dad when I
[1:57:33] got to weigh 100 pounds I'd have to get
[1:57:34] around on crutches I'd never been on
[1:57:38] crutches at 62 years old I had to learn
[1:57:42] how to walk on crutches for about 3 days
[1:57:46] because I'll let a Honda gowing
[1:57:47] motorcycle get away from me me
[1:57:51] [Music]
[1:57:53] oh so when I tell you that I feel like
[1:57:56] God's been better to me than he has to
[1:57:58] anybody and I know we all feel that way
[1:58:01] but you understand just a little bit if
[1:58:04] I start crying a little bit singing God
[1:58:07] uh you've surely been good to me you you
[1:58:10] understand a little bit now when I was
[1:58:13] in my sophomore year of high school at
[1:58:16] Creek Monon just a about a 30 m south of
[1:58:21] Chicago the track coach wanted me to go
[1:58:24] out for the 100 yard dash that's a long
[1:58:27] way from getting around on crutches amen
[1:58:30] but that's my
[1:58:32] God
[1:58:33] Amen he's here
[1:58:37] tonight he's here
[1:58:41] tonight brother Scotty I'm expecting him
[1:58:45] thank you brother God bless you maybe
[1:58:48] you can turn the lights out for just a
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:53] second I I've even got a testimony about
[1:58:56] this
[1:58:58] picture the school wasn't supposed to be
[1:59:03] open but there was a grade school that
[1:59:06] had a
[1:59:07] fire so they had the graduating class
[1:59:10] from the grade school to meet at Steven
[1:59:14] T mats High
[1:59:16] School on the Monday morning I I've
[1:59:19] never heard of a graduation from grade
[1:59:21] school on
[1:59:24] Monday when I got
[1:59:27] there there was a a lady at the front
[1:59:30] desk that a young boy walked in with a
[1:59:34] backpack and she said young man do you
[1:59:37] have a pass to be here and he said no
[1:59:41] she said then
[1:59:42] either you get out of
[1:59:45] here or I'll have you escorted out by
[1:59:48] the police
[1:59:49] I thought oh
[1:59:51] my my granddaughter wanted to go to this
[1:59:55] Auditorium for her
[2:00:00] birthday and so we Googled the address
[2:00:04] and I hadn't been there
[2:00:08] since
[2:00:10] but brother Jordan another picture here
[2:00:13] I'll let you post
[2:00:17] it out side where we was waiting to get
[2:00:21] in uh under the
[2:00:23] foyer
[2:00:25] but we walked around to the auditorium
[2:00:28] and I I told my son-in-law I said this
[2:00:31] is it and I stepped up to the door and I
[2:00:35] I looked in they they had double wood
[2:00:37] doors with the narrow uh glass pane they
[2:00:42] common going into school
[2:00:44] auditoriums that way nobody gets hit
[2:00:46] when the doors open and uh uh there was
[2:00:49] a a black lady standing there at 32 35
[2:00:53] years old and she said sir do you have a
[2:00:57] past to get in I said no ma'am I don't
[2:01:00] and she said I'm sorry I can't let you
[2:01:03] in it's by reservation only because it's
[2:01:06] the grade school from wherever uh that's
[2:01:11] graduating and I saides ma'am I said but
[2:01:14] you don't understand I said ' in
[2:01:18] 1961 they was having a gospel meeting in
[2:01:21] this Auditorium down there on the
[2:01:23] platform there was a man of God I was
[2:01:25] born crippled in my feet I was having to
[2:01:27] wear shoes with braces on them and the
[2:01:29] doctor said when I got to weigh 100 PB I
[2:01:32] wouldn't be able to walk I I said and
[2:01:34] the man up there we were sitting right
[2:01:36] back here next to the back row and he
[2:01:39] called out my dad by
[2:01:42] name Mr farmer said you're praying for a
[2:01:46] boy sitting there there's something
[2:01:47] wrong with his feet do you believe that
[2:01:48] God model healing I said that night they
[2:01:50] took off the special belt shoes she said
[2:01:53] my I said that was a miracle I said yes
[2:01:57] ma'am it
[2:01:58] was she said sir if you would just be
[2:02:02] very quiet and slip
[2:02:05] in you can go
[2:02:08] in I said I also have my daughter and my
[2:02:12] granddaughter here she said your whole
[2:02:14] family just be
[2:02:15] quiet praise the Lord that's how we got
[2:02:18] these pictures
[2:02:21] my God's good he opens
[2:02:25] doors if you've ever read the scriptures
[2:02:28] pertaining to the church ages in the
[2:02:32] Philadelphian Church age he said I open
[2:02:35] doors that no man can shut and I shut
[2:02:38] doors that no man can open I'm a witness
[2:02:41] of those
[2:02:43] things one time we was advertising a
[2:02:46] gospel meeting and I felt led to go a
[2:02:48] little convenience store a place called
[2:02:50] Kosh kanong
[2:02:53] Missouri and when I walked in I thought
[2:02:56] what a place to post a bill for a gospel
[2:02:59] meeting had a flashing C's beer sign on
[2:03:03] the front
[2:03:05] window by this time the radio station
[2:03:09] door was
[2:03:11] locked and I had walked around the side
[2:03:15] and the side door was
[2:03:17] open so I walked
[2:03:20] in and when the front door was locked I
[2:03:24] handed them a hand bill that they
[2:03:26] advertised our meeting God opens closed
[2:03:31] doors so when I got down to this
[2:03:33] convenience store I was feeling pretty
[2:03:38] bold and I hollered halfway across the
[2:03:41] store do you happen to have a bulletin
[2:03:44] board where I can post a gospel
[2:03:47] meeting
[2:03:49] lady says uh yes right over there do you
[2:03:54] need any thumb TXS I said' no ma'am I've
[2:03:56] got my own but I thank
[2:03:59] you went up to the the
[2:04:02] center uh the convocation center at West
[2:04:07] Plains I walked in I said can I post
[2:04:10] these
[2:04:11] bills they said no we're sorry they
[2:04:13] don't allow you to post any bills except
[2:04:16] for an event that takes place at the
[2:04:18] convocation
[2:04:20] Center I said okay she said if you want
[2:04:24] to go around talk to the administration
[2:04:26] office you can I said okay where are
[2:04:27] they at she said well it said uh you can
[2:04:30] drive around well it took me 30 minutes
[2:04:32] to find a parking spot I said ma'am I'll
[2:04:34] just walk she said do whatever you want
[2:04:36] to I walked around the edge of the
[2:04:39] building and there was a Filipino woman
[2:04:42] at the parking lot that was struggling
[2:04:45] trying to get a folding table out of the
[2:04:48] back of a little white it was either a a
[2:04:52] a Honda Accord or a Toyota Corolla small
[2:04:56] car or or a Toyota Camry rather and
[2:05:00] uh I said ma'am do you need some help
[2:05:03] with
[2:05:04] that and she just slumped her sh she
[2:05:07] said
[2:05:09] please I went over it wasn't nothing for
[2:05:12] a 200 pound man if I was a little
[2:05:14] heavier then than what I am now I I

[2:06:14] 4 I I'm sorry I I don't mean to have
[2:06:16] y'all up and down be read it again just
[2:06:19] a
[2:06:22] second you all have all
[2:06:25] read in the Book of Genesis of how that
[2:06:28] Abraham and Sarah met Mel chdc
[2:06:34] right and when he
[2:06:37] come see it wasn't brother brandom that
[2:06:40] knew where my daddy was sitting it
[2:06:43] wasn't brother brandom that knew that I
[2:06:45] was sitting on the floor in between them
[2:06:48] because brother brandham when he said a
[2:06:49] boy sitting next there he pointed down
[2:06:51] at the ground I was not visible to
[2:06:53] William brandham but I was visible to
[2:06:56] the god of
[2:07:02] William that one that knew was the one
[2:07:07] that visited Abraham and
[2:07:10] Sarah and he told
[2:07:13] them why did Sarah
[2:07:17] laugh and brother Bram said she just
[2:07:20] kind of laughed up her
[2:07:22] sleeve to muffle
[2:07:24] it you don't muffle the spirit of
[2:07:29] God you don't make it so quiet because
[2:07:32] he knows the thoughts and the intents of
[2:07:34] the
[2:07:36] heart but he give them a promise that
[2:07:39] they would have a
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:46] son according to the time of life
[2:07:49] life and as you and I know she had to
[2:07:52] take a body
[2:07:54] change I don't
[2:07:56] believe the
[2:07:59] King was wanting to chase a 90-year-old
[2:08:02] snaggle tooth wrinkled face
[2:08:07] Grandma he had his
[2:08:11] choice but she'd been
[2:08:14] changed to a young and
[2:08:17] beautiful
[2:08:19] I've got it pictured in my mind about
[2:08:21] like I'm going to see all of us here
[2:08:22] brother Scotty in a few days that we
[2:08:25] ain't going to be 67 years old 66 years
[2:08:28] old but we're going to be right at the
[2:08:30] peak Prime of our youth of 1819 21 year
[2:08:35] old if you want to know what to look for
[2:08:38] in me don't look for me with a limp from
[2:08:41] where I stuck a hatchet in my knee don't
[2:08:45] look for me with a wrinkled up face tell
[2:08:47] my wife why if you want a picture of me
[2:08:50] at about 19 years old standing next to
[2:08:53] oh Honda 350 motorcycle because that's
[2:08:56] lot a lot more what I'm going to look
[2:08:58] like but I won't be wearing them
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:03] glasses oh
[2:09:08] no so I know according to the Book of
[2:09:12] Genesis according to the time of life
[2:09:15] after she was made a young lady you
[2:09:18] sisters you you know about it and all
[2:09:20] the adults do I'm sure but there's a
[2:09:23] cycle of life and and where the the
[2:09:27] sisters would would be
[2:09:33] fertile on the tape spiritual first off
[2:09:36] we were there when brother brandom
[2:09:38] preached the message standing in the
[2:09:41] Gap when brother way Brother Scott had
[2:09:45] brother way stay in his home he he he
[2:09:47] can tell you brother Way's side of the
[2:09:49] testimony I I've never heard
[2:09:52] that but brother
[2:09:54] way brother brandham was talking about a
[2:09:56] complex and brother way turned around
[2:09:58] and spoke to his wife and said I resent
[2:10:02] that if you
[2:10:05] count playing the tape from about the
[2:10:08] time that brother brandham started
[2:10:10] talking about a complex and brother Bram
[2:10:12] said we all get
[2:10:16] them until
[2:10:18] sister way hollered out he's dead a
[2:10:21] registered nurse dropped down next to
[2:10:23] him tried to take his
[2:10:26] pulse it was the the the Tabernacle had
[2:10:29] three rows of seats uh we were sitting
[2:10:33] in in the middle row uh about where you
[2:10:36] all are back there the three four rows
[2:10:39] back and uh of course brother way was up
[2:10:42] here on the front about where you are
[2:10:44] sis and
[2:10:47] uh
[2:10:49] brother brandham just walked around on
[2:10:51] this side of the platform he said uh uh
[2:10:54] everybody just be real reverent be
[2:10:56] praying and he went
[2:11:01] down and it got real quiet and you could
[2:11:04] hear Brother brandham praying just a
[2:11:06] little bit and after just 45 seconds or
[2:11:11] so he stood up throw his hand up in the
[2:11:15] air and said praise the Lord said
[2:11:17] everybody just give God the praise the
[2:11:20] Lord restored my brother's Health back
[2:11:23] of course on the tape that night you can
[2:11:25] hear brother brandham say that he said
[2:11:28] his heart beat about three times real
[2:11:30] fast like Thump Thump Thump and then
[2:11:32] just went back to beating normal
[2:11:34] again just another day in the life of a
[2:11:39] man of God Amen y on July the 18th of
[2:11:47] 1965 we were again at the Tabernacle and
[2:11:50] brother Brandon preached a message
[2:11:52] entitled spiritual food and due
[2:11:55] season and there was a prayer line in
[2:11:58] there and by this time there was four of
[2:12:01] us kids and why mom and dad wanted
[2:12:04] another child after us I don't
[2:12:08] know but they
[2:12:10] did but my mother had had a lot of

[2:12:39] lifethreatening
[2:12:41] but mom got in the prayer line and and
[2:12:44] just in front of mom in the prayer line
[2:12:47] there was a lady that when she stepped
[2:12:49] up to brother brandham brother brandham

[2:15:11] deer was shot was a bow hunting area
[2:15:16] where they didn't have to wear color

[2:15:47] real in my
[2:15:48] so amen second Timothy verse uh CH 4 and
[2:15:53] verse 7 and
[2:15:56] 8 and we find Paul speaking
[2:15:59] here and he
[2:16:02] said I have fought a good
[2:16:05] fight I have finished my
[2:16:09] course I have
[2:16:12] kept the
[2:16:16] faith it wasn't just his faith you know
[2:16:19] this is about like that Ministry wasn't
[2:16:22] Paul's Ministry it was the
[2:16:26] ministry and people have faith people
[2:16:29] have faith in this that or something
[2:16:32] else brother one was telling us that
[2:16:35] that when he was just a child how that
[2:16:36] he had a hernia but his mother had faith
[2:16:40] in in a a spring or or a well that they
[2:16:44] had somebody had seen an image of of
[2:16:47] some uh Catholic saint there and his
[2:16:50] mother had faith in that got some of
[2:16:53] that water put it on the hery and the
[2:16:55] herni has shrunk down because of her
[2:16:57] faith people have faith in different
[2:16:59] things and God honors
[2:17:05] Faith go back and listen to anointed
[2:17:08] ones at the end time listen to brother
[2:17:11] bram's own testimony he said even if I
[2:17:14] was a hypocrite God would have been Duty
[2:17:17] bound to have honored that woman's
[2:17:23] faith I have kept the
[2:17:27] faith
[2:17:28] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[2:17:32] crown of
[2:17:33] righteousness which the Lord the
[2:17:36] righteous judge shall give me at that
[2:17:39] day and not to me
[2:17:43] only but to
[2:17:46] us but on to all them also that love his
[2:17:51] appearing may the Lord bless his word
[2:17:54] and you all as as we've been partakers
[2:17:57] of that word you can be seated if you
[2:18:00] want you know
[2:18:04] Paul had quite a
[2:18:10] revelation another thought that Paul had
[2:18:13] we we see him starting out in uh in
[2:18:18] Romans 8 verse 1 and 2 I believe it is
[2:18:22] where he says that there is therefore
[2:18:24] now no condemnation in those that are in
[2:18:28] Christ Jesus I don't care what your past
[2:18:32] is I want you to know that God is not
[2:18:35] worried about your past it's your future
[2:18:39] that he's
[2:18:41] concerned amen amen amen amen there is
[2:18:46] therefore now no condemnation now I have
[2:18:50] always looked at that only to a certain
[2:18:55] degree and that is that oh my in Christ
[2:18:59] Jesus I am free from the When sin has
[2:19:03] been placed under the
[2:19:05] blood could I share just another just
[2:19:08] short thing with you here for just a
[2:19:10] second a man walked up uh uh uh through
[2:19:13] the prayer line and uh he had a a Bad
[2:19:17] Hat it and when he got up to uh uh
[2:19:20] brother brandham he said brother he said
[2:19:23] have you uh placed all of your sin under
[2:19:26] the blood and he said well I had a bad
[2:19:30] habit he said have you asked the Lord to
[2:19:32] forgive you he said yes I did he said
[2:19:35] when did you do it he said while I was
[2:19:37] standing in the
[2:19:39] line and brother brandham said will he
[2:19:41] must have heard your prayer because it
[2:19:43] was hid from
[2:19:46] me
[2:19:48] that quick it doesn't there's no 90day
[2:19:51] waiting period there's no 7day cooling
[2:19:54] off period but when it comes before the
[2:19:57] Throne of God and it's cast into the sea
[2:20:01] of forgetfulness it works right
[2:20:06] now
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:10] amen
[2:20:14] amen but you know there's another side
[2:20:17] to that that I hadn't considered until
[2:20:21] here just a few weeks
[2:20:23] ago there is therefore now no
[2:20:27] [Music]
[2:20:28] condemnation in those that are in Christ
[2:20:35] Jesus because when I am in Christ
[2:20:39] Jesus I have the life of Jesus Christ
[2:20:44] that motivates
[2:20:46] me
[2:20:48] and when the Lord Jesus walked down to
[2:20:50] the
[2:20:52] well at
[2:20:55] Samaria and that woman come up she had
[2:20:59] condemnation in her she had condemnation
[2:21:03] all over
[2:21:05] her she was not allowed to come up at
[2:21:08] the cool time of day to get water with
[2:21:11] all of the quote unquote good
[2:21:16] women but because of her
[2:21:19] condition she was unclean to them they
[2:21:22] didn't want to be defiled by this
[2:21:24] unclean woman so she could not come to
[2:21:27] get water at the well at the same time
[2:21:30] of day that they
[2:21:34] could and so the Lord Jesus comes up to
[2:21:37] her and says give me a drink of
[2:21:45] water and he told older said if you knew
[2:21:48] of the water that I
[2:21:53] have you'd ask me for a drink she said
[2:21:56] the Well's deep and you don't have
[2:21:58] anything to draw
[2:22:01] with so then he just started talking to
[2:22:03] her a little
[2:22:06] bit the same way that the spirit of God
[2:22:08] was talking to Mr
[2:22:11] farmer the same way the spirit of God
[2:22:13] was talking to Mrs
[2:22:16] Migel
[2:22:18] and he started telling her what her past
[2:22:21] was you've had five husbands go get your
[2:22:24] husband and and bring there I sir I have
[2:22:27] no
[2:22:28] husband maybe a little bit bitter right
[2:22:32] there we don't know the conditions on
[2:22:35] the marriage and divorce of the first
[2:22:41] five but the Lord Jesus didn't have any
[2:22:45] condemnation in him remember he said he
[2:22:48] didn't come to condemn the world but to
[2:22:50] save it that's right and when you and I
[2:22:54] are in Christ there's no condemnation in
[2:22:56] us for anybody else
[2:22:58] either that's the reason why it makes no
[2:23:01] difference who we're witnessing to it
[2:23:04] makes no difference if they look like a
[2:23:06] saint or if they look like a ha we still
[2:23:10] witness to
[2:23:13] them can I drop in just a minute of a
[2:23:16] personal testimony here we we were down
[2:23:19] at St Louis PTO a city uh about 5 hours
[2:23:24] south of the US border and uh we were
[2:23:28] waiting on a pastor that was going to uh
[2:23:32] to show me around there were five
[2:23:34] churches in this
[2:23:36] city and they wouldn't fellowship with
[2:23:39] each
[2:23:39] other I said I want to visit all five of
[2:23:43] the
[2:23:44] pastors so there was one brother that he
[2:23:47] told me I know all of them I know where
[2:23:49] we can contact them and and I will take
[2:23:52] you so he was going to be there at 8:00
[2:23:54] in the morning time in Mexico does not
[2:24:00] exist so at 9:00 the brother still was
[2:24:04] not there and and I've got this list of
[2:24:08] stuff that I think needs to be done
[2:24:11] today and seeing five pastors is the
[2:24:14] first thing and then I'm wanting to have
[2:24:17] have a meeting with them all if I can
[2:24:19] arrange
[2:24:21] that cuz I wanted to challenge them to
[2:24:24] good
[2:24:27] works I said does anybody
[2:24:31] know where we can meet this brother they
[2:24:34] said look there's a deacon in his church
[2:24:37] that has a bakery over here had a a a a
[2:24:41] stone oven that was gas fired was how
[2:24:45] they bake their bread and pastries and
[2:24:47] what have you and they said uh and so
[2:24:51] the pastor almost always goes by there
[2:24:54] and tags bases with the the Deacon I I I
[2:24:57] said well can you take us he said yes
[2:25:00] only about a mile and a half or so so we
[2:25:03] jumped in the car and 5 minutes later
[2:25:05] we're in front of the bakery and and we
[2:25:07] walked through the doors and so it had a
[2:25:10] little step down there and we took that
[2:25:14] first step and and there was a a young
[2:25:17] lady uh I'm going to say
[2:25:20] 24
[2:25:21] 25ish and she was working at a just a a
[2:25:25] table uh needing bread up and
[2:25:30] uh she wasn't dressed the the way that
[2:25:33] we would really think that a a a child
[2:25:36] of God should be dressed she she had on
[2:25:39] a a red jogging suit with a white stripe
[2:25:42] down the the leg and down the sleeves
[2:25:45] and she turned back over her shoulder
[2:25:47] and said something to us in Spanish and
[2:25:50] brother James Miller told me he said she
[2:25:53] said I welcome you to S
[2:25:57] Louis and it it gripped my
[2:26:02] heart I said brother James I need
[2:26:05] you I said tell
[2:26:07] her we have not been welcomed by the
[2:26:10] Chamber of Commerce of St
[2:26:14] Louis I said to him we have not been
[2:26:17] welcomed by the Ministerial
[2:26:20] Association of St
[2:26:24] Louis but
[2:26:26] you have welcomed us as
[2:26:30] missionaries to St
[2:26:33] Louis I held up my Bible I said my Bible
[2:26:37] tells me that if you'll give a prophet a
[2:26:40] drink of water in a prophet's name that
[2:26:43] you can receive a prophet's reward I
[2:26:45] said for you we welcoming
[2:26:48] us it would be my prayer that you could
[2:26:51] have a missionary's reward for welcoming
[2:26:55] us she just kind of slumped down on the
[2:26:59] table like that when I get started
[2:27:02] sometimes I just don't know when to quit
[2:27:05] I said sister I don't know what your
[2:27:08] walk is with the
[2:27:11] Lord I said I there's many people that I
[2:27:14] know of that is young people have had
[2:27:17] something that hurt their feelings that
[2:27:19] have caused them to walk away from the
[2:27:22] gospel by now the Deacon behind me over
[2:27:25] here is quit
[2:27:26] working I said but I want you to know
[2:27:29] that if there's a place in your heart
[2:27:32] that you want to be in the arms of God
[2:27:35] there's a place in the arms of God that
[2:27:38] was tailor made for you and nobody else
[2:27:42] will fit it actually what was going
[2:27:44] through my mind was brother Brandon said
[2:27:47] a quote said that when you Embrace a a
[2:27:50] woman up to you your wife that it makes
[2:27:52] an imprint on you and nobody else can
[2:27:55] fit that
[2:27:57] imprint I'll use that even in witnessing
[2:28:00] and testifying to people the young lady
[2:28:03] started
[2:28:05] crying about that time there's a young
[2:28:07] man that was working back here now what
[2:28:10] I didn't know is this is the Deacon's
[2:28:12] daughter and the Deacon's brother in the
[2:28:16] back he's tattooed up like a drug lord
[2:28:20] because that's the realm that he was in
[2:28:23] he was working with a a drug running
[2:28:26] gang he had tattoos all up here he had
[2:28:29] what we call the athletic t-shirt you
[2:28:31] know just got the the little strips up
[2:28:34] here in low cut and solid
[2:28:40] tattoo and he said what about
[2:28:43] me he said I've got these tattoos from
[2:28:46] my past
[2:28:48] life but see there was another
[2:28:52] testimony my dad was in the
[2:28:55] Navy every Navy boy winds up with a
[2:28:58] tattoo Dad wasn't saved he had a vulgar
[2:29:02] picture of a woman on his forearm that
[2:29:06] after he got saved he had to wear
[2:29:07] longsleeve shirts not because we were
[2:29:09] Apostolic but he had to hide that
[2:29:15] tattoo that comes to
[2:29:17] mine I told him I said sir I said my dad
[2:29:22] had a tattoo that he was ashamed of
[2:29:24] after he got saved and he went to a
[2:29:26] tattoo parlor and he told the tattoos he
[2:29:30] said I want this thing covered up what
[2:29:32] can you put on there he said what do you
[2:29:34] want he said do you have an
[2:29:38] eagle he said I believe I do and he put
[2:29:42] the template on there and he said I can
[2:29:45] cover up everything thing except the
[2:29:47] woman's elbow where she was like
[2:29:50] that Dad said well what can you do for
[2:29:52] that he said I'll put a snake in its
[2:29:54] mouth dad said do
[2:29:59] it I described the tattoo the same way I
[2:30:03] did to you as a church what I did not
[2:30:07] know is that the flag of
[2:30:10] Mexico is made up because a man had a
[2:30:14] vision of where they would place the
[2:30:17] capital of Mexico and it was going to be
[2:30:20] next to a lake because there was an
[2:30:23] eagle that was in a bush with a green
[2:30:27] snake in its
[2:30:30] mouth the Perfection of God is
[2:30:36] unlimited right
[2:30:37] brother I describe that now the Deacon's
[2:30:42] back here crying this young man's crying
[2:30:45] I said you you could go to a tattoo
[2:30:47] artist that could maybe take a flesh
[2:30:50] colored ink and cover up the tattoos on
[2:30:53] your body I said but those tattoos won't
[2:30:56] keep you awake at night I said but we've
[2:30:59] got things in our past life that's put
[2:31:01] tattoos on our heart that will keep us
[2:31:04] awake at night I said but I want you to
[2:31:06] know that the power of the bleach blood
[2:31:09] of Jesus Christ is more than able not
[2:31:13] only to do away with tattoos on our
[2:31:15] bodies but the tattoos on our heart and
[2:31:18] the what's in our mind and to take us
[2:31:21] back to where we're perfectly pure and
[2:31:23] clean
[2:31:24] again by the grace of God we were able
[2:31:27] to lead those two young people to the
[2:31:30] Lord right there and within three
[2:31:33] minutes of the time that we got up from
[2:31:35] praying the pastor walked in through the
[2:31:37] door that was going to take us to show
[2:31:38] us
[2:31:41] around oh don't tell me he's not an
[2:31:43] ontime
[2:31:45] God amen but you know what with
[2:31:48] condemnation in us we can't tell some we
[2:31:52] can't address somebody that's not
[2:31:54] dressed exactly the way we think they
[2:31:57] ought to be dressed as sister but you
[2:32:01] know what if we'll follow the leadership
[2:32:03] of the Lord and just say what he says
[2:32:06] it'll work out fine every time that may
[2:32:10] mess with your theology but sometimes
[2:32:13] our theology needs to be messed with
[2:32:16] amen
[2:32:18] amen
[2:32:21] amen the work of an apostle is to go
[2:32:25] into a place where there is no church or
[2:32:29] brother Bram said that that Apostle is a
[2:32:31] Setter in
[2:32:35] order it's not just a Setter in order of
[2:32:37] churches it's a Setter in order of
[2:32:39] spirits and if somebody's let their
[2:32:42] Spirit get out of line because of a a
[2:32:45] mishap of infidelity in a church that it
[2:32:48] just threw them for a loop and that girl
[2:32:52] as a 17-year-old girl walked away from
[2:32:55] God and said there's nothing in it if an
[2:32:57] elder from the church could fall oh let
[2:33:00] me tell you what don't put your security
[2:33:03] and being an elder in the church let
[2:33:05] your security be in the blood of Jesus
[2:33:08] Christ and the sealing power of the Holy
[2:33:12] Ghost Paul had a past life Paul's past
[2:33:17] life most of us wouldn't even went to
[2:33:19] hear Paul
[2:33:20] preach could you imagine are you going
[2:33:23] to go down and and and and and hear uh
[2:33:26] uh this man Paul
[2:33:28] preach you mean the one that tortured
[2:33:31] Uncle
[2:33:34] Joe is that the
[2:33:38] one the one that was standing there
[2:33:40] holding the coats for everybody when
[2:33:42] when they Stone my brother-in-law Steven
[2:33:45] and you you want me to go hear him
[2:33:50] preach past
[2:33:54] life what I want to talk to you about
[2:33:56] for just a few minutes
[2:33:58] tonight is no
[2:34:05] regrets we've all got things in our past
[2:34:08] life uh
[2:34:10] uh brother Brandon made a statement in
[2:34:13] Revelation chapter 4
[2:34:18] 1960 he said this is New Year's night
[2:34:21] Eve and of course everybody's got a vow
[2:34:25] wrote out and a pledge and and you're
[2:34:27] going to make for new years's and and
[2:34:30] and then about Day After Tomorrow
[2:34:32] they'll all be
[2:34:33] broke and so you know you turn over a
[2:34:36] new page every year and then turn back
[2:34:39] the page the next morning did it
[2:34:43] again but there's just one thing that
[2:34:46] that I would like to say and that is
[2:34:49] that it's about like Apostle Paul said
[2:34:52] forgetting those things are in the past
[2:34:56] all my mistakes and all the things that
[2:34:58] I have done I press towards the mark of
[2:35:02] the high calling in Christ and that's
[2:35:06] the only regrets that I have is my erors
[2:35:09] for the past year of the past part of my
[2:35:13] life and I only humbly ask him for Grace
[2:35:17] to press on towards the mark of the high
[2:35:20] calling I'm sure that's the testimony of
[2:35:24] uh of all of us we'd all feel that way
[2:35:30] amen amen amen but
[2:35:36] Paul he's already give
[2:35:39] witness that he was on the road to
[2:35:43] Damascus and he was carrying could you
[2:35:46] imagine somebody going and getting
[2:35:57] letters could you imagine hearing one of
[2:36:01] the brothers here in the church
[2:36:03] say I just went to Brother Juan and I
[2:36:05] got some letters so that I can go down
[2:36:08] and and persecute and stone anybody that
[2:36:13] baptizes in the titles of father son and
[2:36:16] Holy
[2:36:18] Ghost no because that's not what's in
[2:36:21] brother Juan's heart he's not going to
[2:36:22] give you any letters to do that he's
[2:36:24] going to stop you from doing it saying
[2:36:26] first why don't you just show him some
[2:36:27] love and the truth and and see what God
[2:36:31] does Amen because that's what Christ
[2:36:36] did so Christ through your pastor Christ
[2:36:40] through you is going to manifest that
[2:36:42] same Life of Christ that way but but yet
[2:36:46] that was where Paul was and of course
[2:36:49] the hierarchy of the church that he was
[2:36:51] with they wanted to do away with any
[2:36:55] sect anybody that didn't see things
[2:36:57] exactly like them you know brother
[2:37:00] brandham told us he said if you got two
[2:37:02] men you got two ideas as I have not
[2:37:05] found anything that Brother Juan and I
[2:37:07] disagree on but I promise you you let us
[2:37:10] spend about a a eight or 10 months
[2:37:15] together day and night we'll find
[2:37:18] something we disagree on if it's got to
[2:37:21] be hot
[2:37:24] sauce we'll find
[2:37:26] something I use a little bit of hot
[2:37:30] sauce but I have never baptized a piece
[2:37:34] of meat in hot
[2:37:36] sauce we would find
[2:37:39] something because you got two men you've
[2:37:43] got two opinions and and I've said it
[2:37:45] like this you know uh uh opinions are
[2:37:47] about like eyebrows everybody's got a
[2:37:50] couple of them and they raise them every
[2:37:51] once in a
[2:37:53] while and but most of our opinions would
[2:37:56] be a whole lot better off if I if we
[2:37:59] just stay quiet and say Lord you put
[2:38:02] words in my mouth not my opinion ain't
[2:38:05] isn't going to help you but the word of
[2:38:08] God will establish us and raise us up to
[2:38:11] a higher level than where we've beenk
[2:38:14] you Lord now
[2:38:16] Paul he had been going out with these
[2:38:19] letters to persecute the Saints and and
[2:38:22] and bore witness of the the stoning of
[2:38:26] Sten as we said here just a couple
[2:38:28] minutes ago and and all of these things
[2:38:32] that he's doing but you know there come
[2:38:35] a time oh he was he was
[2:38:39] scholarly he knew the writings of the
[2:38:43] word of God he did not have a revelation
[2:38:46] of the word but he did know the
[2:38:52] word that was a good thing that's one
[2:38:55] reason why I try to
[2:38:57] testify I was telling Brother Juan
[2:39:00] they've got me on a trucker prayer
[2:39:03] line where these guys are doing a Bible
[2:39:07] study and and my my son uh told him a
[2:39:11] little bit of of something that happened
[2:39:14] and the man that orchestr ated the whole
[2:39:16] thing he said give me his phone number I
[2:39:18] want to talk to
[2:39:19] him so he called me
[2:39:22] up they had me on one of their preaching
[2:39:25] deals where I'm preaching over a phone
[2:39:27] to these guys no matter where they're at
[2:39:30] the next Thursday
[2:39:33] night so every morning that I'm
[2:39:35] available between 9 and 10:00 I'll call
[2:39:38] in on this number they'll read through
[2:39:40] of
[2:39:41] Psalms brother farmer what's your take
[2:39:44] on this
[2:39:47] nonetheless the gospel is preached Hall
[2:39:52] amen Lord and you know what because most
[2:39:55] of them are Baptist you know where I
[2:39:57] normally start
[2:39:59] out well like I heard a Baptist preacher
[2:40:02] say one
[2:40:03] time this friend of mine that was
[2:40:05] ordained in a Baptist Church by Dr Roy
[2:40:09] Davis I was working for a Rancher and
[2:40:13] and and I was sitting up there one time
[2:40:15] with my just crooked across the saddle
[2:40:17] horn and and the ranger was it had to be
[2:40:20] a genuine Herford he wasn't looking for
[2:40:23] the brand but he was looking to see that
[2:40:26] it was a purebred herper by the blood
[2:40:29] tag that was in its
[2:40:32] ear until they have confidence in me
[2:40:36] I'll continue to address brother
[2:40:38] brandham as a Baptist preacher to him
[2:40:41] brother brandom said when you're talking
[2:40:42] to a for a farmer you talk about raising
[2:40:45] and
[2:40:48] corn but there's one of them right now
[2:40:51] that's got some questions on the church
[2:40:54] age Messengers that I'm fixing to have
[2:40:56] to go up into Northern Minnesota and
[2:40:58] jump in a boat and fish with
[2:41:03] it you say brother farmer that's a long
[2:41:05] way to
[2:41:07] go
[2:41:09] no I'm dealing with 10,000
[2:41:14] worlds
[2:41:17] I'm dealing with 10,000 worlds with one
[2:41:21] soul I know people that'll work day and
[2:41:25] night just trying to make $1 million do
[2:41:28] that's
[2:41:29] right that will
[2:41:34] perish this 10,000 worlds I'm talking
[2:41:37] about will not
[2:41:39] perish
[2:41:41] amen Paul had
[2:41:44] baggage Paul had some things behind him
[2:41:47] that he wasn't real proud of but you
[2:41:49] know after he come face to face with a
[2:41:52] pillar of fire and I love the way that
[2:41:54] the prophet of God said that that every
[2:41:57] every true Minister must come face to
[2:42:01] face with that Pillar of
[2:42:03] Fire
[2:42:06] amen Paul Come face to face with him and
[2:42:10] he knew that
[2:42:12] light with a voice coming out of it
[2:42:15] because because he knew his
[2:42:17] scriptures I don't care if they're
[2:42:20] Baptist I don't care if they're Assembly
[2:42:22] of God if they know their Bible I want a
[2:42:26] chance to talk to
[2:42:30] them
[2:42:34] hello my son-in-law had his uncle to
[2:42:38] come to a family get together here not
[2:42:40] too long ago and and his uncle would had
[2:42:43] been a a he's got a degree from the the
[2:42:48] Dallas uh Baptist Seminary and also the
[2:42:51] one down in in
[2:42:53] Georgia and he said why is it I'm not
[2:42:55] seeing any life in my in our churches
[2:42:59] anymore he said why is it there's no
[2:43:01] respect to the things of God the way
[2:43:03] that it was 30 and 40 years ago I said
[2:43:06] if you'll give me a half an hour before
[2:43:08] you get out of here I think I can help
[2:43:10] you with that
[2:43:14] question
[2:43:17] I went up to his condo then on Sunday
[2:43:21] morning he wanted to know what time I I
[2:43:23] I thought Church time would be a good
[2:43:25] time we have church at 10:00 I said how
[2:43:27] about 10:00 he said I'll be ready his
[2:43:30] wife was sitting over across a typical
[2:43:34] Baptist lady uh sweet nature she was
[2:43:37] sitting over there doing whatever she
[2:43:39] was doing across the room and I asked
[2:43:41] him I said do you have a Thompson Chain
[2:43:44] Bible he said I don't have it with me
[2:43:46] but I've got it at home that I study out
[2:43:48] of I said okay so I I I just turned over
[2:43:51] in mine over into the reference part of
[2:43:53] it and it it's number 42 something but
[2:43:57] it's got a a a an exposition of the
[2:44:00] seven churches of Asia Minor and it's
[2:44:03] almost word for word to what the prophet
[2:44:06] of God taught it has everything except
[2:44:09] the church age
[2:44:13] Messengers and he said I've never seen
[2:44:16] that so I said okay now let's go over
[2:44:19] here to Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter
[2:44:21] 3 and I just went down down through it
[2:44:25] onto the
[2:44:26] angel of Ephesus I I said now there
[2:44:30] would be very few people that would have
[2:44:32] any argument except that that that was
[2:44:35] uh
[2:44:36] Paul and he said sure sure I I I I see
[2:44:39] that okay then I went on
[2:44:42] into some would say polycarp
[2:44:45] but we believe that it's irus now
[2:44:48] polycarp was a student of John the
[2:44:50] Revelator but irania studied under
[2:44:53] polycarp but polycarp leaned towards
[2:44:55] that organized Spirit but irius was
[2:44:58] militant against
[2:44:59] it
[2:45:01] so he said okay he said yes he said I've
[2:45:04] heard of some of the works of Iran okay
[2:45:07] going into colba when we got up to St
[2:45:11] Martin I I said you know some of them
[2:45:14] would say it was Patrick but we believe
[2:45:17] that it was Martin there was nothing in
[2:45:19] St Patrick where there really was a
[2:45:22] supernal move he did train the dogs to
[2:45:25] lay on top of him he escaped because of
[2:45:28] that and he said how did you know that I
[2:45:32] said well I read a little
[2:45:40] bit I said but with
[2:45:44] Martin
[2:45:46] you know there come a time that a man
[2:45:49] died and everybody was mourning what
[2:45:51] what happened was a young man come and
[2:45:53] and told Martin he said I want to have
[2:45:56] power with God the way that you have
[2:45:58] power with God he said if you want to
[2:46:00] have power with God the way that I have
[2:46:02] he said you're going to have to learn to
[2:46:04] live the way that I live he said you
[2:46:06] stay here and you pray I've got to be
[2:46:08] gone for a week preaching when I come
[2:46:11] back I'll show you how I live not tell
[2:46:14] you but I'll show
[2:46:16] you that's
[2:46:19] free amen I don't think we need to tell
[2:46:22] people how to live I don't think we need
[2:46:24] to tell people how to pray we need to
[2:46:26] show them how to pray need to show them
[2:46:29] how to
[2:46:32] live Martin come back and the whole
[2:46:35] place was in an uproar they were
[2:46:37] mourning because this boy had died and
[2:46:40] Martin run everybody out and he laid
[2:46:43] himself on top of this young
[2:46:47] man exactly the way that Elijah did and
[2:46:51] the way that our Elijah laid down on top
[2:46:54] of a boy named
[2:46:58] Li that had been caught between two
[2:47:00] train cars and had punctured his lungs
[2:47:04] and he was
[2:47:07] bleeding both of them came back to life
[2:47:10] and the one that Martin laid on top of
[2:47:12] came back to life and the one that
[2:47:15] had to come back to life give a
[2:47:17] testimony that he was in a dark place
[2:47:20] but was walking towards a light and two
[2:47:23] angels came up on either side of him and
[2:47:26] said you can't have this one Martin
[2:47:28] calls for
[2:47:31] it
[2:47:33] Hallelujah he said I've heard that story
[2:47:36] but we thought it was only heay I said
[2:47:39] it's written
[2:47:42] down I've got a copy of it in my
[2:47:44] briefcase case at
[2:47:47] home I said now when we come up to the
[2:47:50] next
[2:47:52] angel I said there's very few people
[2:47:55] that would challenge it at all except
[2:47:57] that Martin Luther started that
[2:48:00] Reformation out of the Dark Ages and he
[2:48:03] said right I agree with that I said now
[2:48:06] if you're really a hard shell Baptist
[2:48:08] you're probably going to thank John
[2:48:11] Smith I said but really we believe that
[2:48:14] it was Wesley John Wesley who was
[2:48:18] convert when when John Wesley was
[2:48:21] converted it was a man was reading the
[2:48:25] writings of Martin Luther when John
[2:48:29] Wesley give his heart to the
[2:48:31] Lord that's a good way for a messenger
[2:48:34] to come in hearing the words of another
[2:48:38] messenger I said and isn't it remarkable
[2:48:42] that during that time the scripture says
[2:48:45] I set before you an open door and that
[2:48:48] even our immigration policy in the
[2:48:51] nation of America that was the most
[2:48:53] responsible for helping to spread the
[2:48:56] gospel our uh
[2:48:58] uh immigration policy was called the
[2:49:01] open door policy when they was letting
[2:49:04] people come in from all he said my
[2:49:07] goodness I I've I've never thought of
[2:49:08] that i' I've never heard anybody say
[2:49:13] that
[2:49:15] I said
[2:49:16] now if we can identify a man that was
[2:49:20] the
[2:49:21] angel to those other six Church
[2:49:24] ages who is the
[2:49:27] Angel to Leo
[2:49:30] deia he said that's why you guys follow
[2:49:32] that Johnny brandham isn't it I said
[2:49:36] brother William brandham I said yes sir
[2:49:38] that's exactly right we believe that's
[2:49:40] exactly who he is a Baptist man telling
[2:49:44] me
[2:49:45] that's why you believe what you
[2:49:49] believe if they if they know their Bible
[2:49:54] I'm willing to talk to
[2:49:56] them because I will use their Bible to
[2:50:00] show them what we
[2:50:04] believe
[2:50:06] amen Amen brother brandham did witness
[2:50:09] of the Bible but the Bible witnessed of
[2:50:12] the
[2:50:13] message
[2:50:17] amen I'm a little bit off track here as
[2:50:20] you can
[2:50:23] tell but when Paul Come face to face
[2:50:26] with that Pillar of
[2:50:28] Fire when he when that great light
[2:50:32] struck him down and spoke to him and
[2:50:35] said Paul it's hard for you to kick
[2:50:37] against the
[2:50:39] priest he said Lord who are you him
[2:50:43] being a Jew and knowing the scriptures
[2:50:46] the way that he did there was no way
[2:50:49] that he would address anything except
[2:50:52] for Jehovah God as
[2:50:59] Lord and Jehovah spoke out of that same
[2:51:03] Pillar of Fire that had led the children
[2:51:05] of Israel out of Egypt and said I'm
[2:51:09] Jesus whom you
[2:51:12] persecute that was a 180 for
[2:51:15] Paul now Paul was
[2:51:17] ashamed now Paul don't know what to do
[2:51:20] but Paul starts getting some Holy Ghost
[2:51:24] leadership to the house of
[2:51:31] Cornelius yall know the rest of the
[2:51:34] story
[2:51:35] right then Paul starts preaching
[2:51:40] Christ he's back on he has his desert
[2:51:44] experience
[2:51:49] I don't know if y'all have ever heard
[2:51:51] the
[2:51:54] tape right after uh one of the Mosby
[2:51:58] Brothers was killed they were test
[2:52:01] pilots in Planes they they worked on
[2:52:03] planes and and what have you and uh the
[2:52:07] one was uh was killed in that plane
[2:52:10] crash and brother brandham in his prayer
[2:52:13] it's almost word word what cesil be deil
[2:52:17] had when Moses was going across the
[2:52:19] desert in the Ten Commandments he said
[2:52:21] Lord these these uh deserts of
[2:52:25] experience where righteous men are
[2:52:27] molded into
[2:52:30] Saints you know sometimes we wonder
[2:52:33] about our desert
[2:52:35] experiences but we all have a need of
[2:52:39] them now Paul gets on the back side of
[2:52:42] the desert and he's having his his
[2:52:44] desert experience and everything that 30
[2:52:48] years of Gia's teaching had drilled into
[2:52:51] him gets knocked out of him so that he
[2:52:55] can be a servant of God he he like I was
[2:52:58] saying this morning he had to die out to
[2:53:01] Paul he had to die out to Judaism he had
[2:53:04] to die out to everything that he was
[2:53:07] living his life for let me tell you
[2:53:11] something young people you may go to

[2:54:32] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[2:54:35] watch and see if God will not put a
[2:54:37] Godly woman into your
[2:54:39] life amen I'm a witness of it I was born
[2:54:43] a a
[2:54:46] at Englewood Memorial Hospital in the
[2:54:48] city of Chicago grew up just south of
[2:54:51] Chicago my wife was born at Water bip
[2:54:54] Michigan we met at a meeting in Hardy
[2:54:57] Arkansas where she
[2:55:04] lived God knows how to pull people
[2:55:06] together my daddy was born and raised
[2:55:09] just outside of Knoxville Tennessee and
[2:55:11] while he was in the Navy going to pick
[2:55:14] up a prisoner at Corbin Kentucky uh uh
[2:55:18] because a man asked him do you have any
[2:55:20] extra Christmas cards he said you want
[2:55:23] some girls's names to write them to and
[2:55:26] my dad wrote to my UNC to my
[2:55:30] aunt my mom's
[2:55:34] sister and on the way to see my
[2:55:37] aunt while he was picking up a prisoner
[2:55:40] in Corbin
[2:55:43] Kentucky he knocks on a door and it was
[2:55:46] my great grandmother's door and my
[2:55:49] mother answered the
[2:55:53] door and dad walked back to the
[2:55:57] cab and said I'm going to marry that
[2:56:04] girl God knows how to pull us
[2:56:08] together if he can pull your pastor out
[2:56:11] of
[2:56:13] Liberia right and bring him to the
[2:56:16] states when he's went through things
[2:56:18] that nobody 50 years old should ever
[2:56:22] seen happen by the time that he is
[2:56:25] 25 if he can pull him out of
[2:56:29] that can he not pull us out of whatever
[2:56:33] scars that we've been messed with if he
[2:56:36] can bring him to a position that God is
[2:56:40] allowing him to draw us up because
[2:56:43] remember brother Bram said you pray for
[2:56:45] your pastor you lift him up that so that
[2:56:49] he can bring you into a higher realm
[2:56:53] then you push him on up higher remember
[2:56:55] the prophet of God talking about looking
[2:56:57] over into the circus somebody hold me up
[2:57:01] okay then I get there to where I can
[2:57:02] look through the
[2:57:04] knole he said now when it's God that
[2:57:07] does it it doesn't require that
[2:57:11] strength but it's a struggle pastoring
[2:57:14] is a struggle support your
[2:57:17] pastor
[2:57:20] amen you you know how to do it you're 25
[2:57:22] years down the road you y'all are such a
[2:57:24] lovely
[2:57:26] congregation lift him up in
[2:57:28] prayer Li you you never know what he's
[2:57:32] battling because he's carrying all of
[2:57:34] our
[2:57:35] burdens
[2:57:38] amen
[2:57:40] amen
[2:57:42] Paul got a
[2:57:44] [Music]
[2:57:45] revelation of putting behind us the
[2:57:49] things that are behind
[2:57:54] us are you hearing me there is no way
[2:57:59] that a man that was
[2:58:03] guilty of persecuting
[2:58:07] Saints putting Christians to
[2:58:10] death standing there and sanctioning
[2:58:13] them
[2:58:16] being court and jury over them and a
[2:58:20] bunch of willing executioners with rocks
[2:58:23] in both hands just waiting to carry out
[2:58:27] the
[2:58:28] order he's guilty
[2:58:33] Stony I couldn't sleep like
[2:58:39] that I'm saying if I had that on my
[2:58:42] conscience I could not sleep
[2:58:47] and neither could
[2:58:48] Paul but he put it under the
[2:58:52] blood and to repent is to turn
[2:58:58] from you don't go sideways to it you
[2:59:02] turn from
[2:59:05] it and you go away from
[2:59:12] it but this
[2:59:14] man could say I have
[2:59:17] fought a good
[2:59:20] fight I have finished my course now
[2:59:24] church I don't really feel like I'm
[2:59:25] fixing to die on the way home don't
[2:59:28] don't get nervous about
[2:59:33] that but list I have kept the faith and
[2:59:39] henceforth there is laid up for me this
[2:59:43] isn't a guilty
[2:59:46] man he didn't say there's laid up for me
[2:59:49] an electric
[2:59:52] chair there's not laid up for me
[2:59:55] condemnation but there is laid up for me
[2:59:58] a crown of
[3:00:01] righteousness which the Lord the
[3:00:03] righteous judge shall give me at that
[3:00:10] day I'm just going to stop right here
[3:00:13] and ask a question question have you got
[3:00:15] something in your past life that's still
[3:00:17] aggravating
[3:00:20] you do you know what I normally find
[3:00:23] people come up through a prayer
[3:00:26] line and there they say uh somebody did
[3:00:30] something to me and I I I just I I'm
[3:00:33] finding it real hard to forgive them and
[3:00:36] I've seen it Time After Time After Time
[3:00:41] do you know what the real reason is
[3:00:45] there's something in their own past life
[3:00:49] that they can't forgive theirself
[3:00:52] for and because they can't forgive
[3:00:56] theirself they have trouble forgiving
[3:00:58] somebody
[3:01:06] else I'm going leave y'all probably very
[3:01:10] early in the
[3:01:12] morning I'm in I'm an early riser if I
[3:01:15] wake up at 4:00 and I feel unrested I'll
[3:01:19] be leaving at 4:00 brother
[3:01:22] one or five just whenever I wake
[3:01:27] up but when I
[3:01:30] leave Brooklyn
[3:01:33] Center I want no
[3:01:38] regrets I want no regrets from anything
[3:01:41] in my past
[3:01:44] and I want no regrets from anything
[3:01:49] present I know I've told you this
[3:01:52] morning and also this
[3:01:54] afternoon there is
[3:01:57] nothing that
[3:01:59] Rivals there's nothing
[3:02:02] close to the importance of the Seal of
[3:02:07] the Holy Ghost in your
[3:02:10] life Paul could not have made that state
[3:02:15] without the Seal of the Holy Ghost in
[3:02:19] his life I'm not talking about a
[3:02:22] baptism I'm not talking about a
[3:02:24] Sanctified life that those things are
[3:02:28] wonderful there's people that don't even
[3:02:31] believe in the Holy Ghost that that it's
[3:02:33] available to people that still live a
[3:02:36] Sanctified life there's people that have
[3:02:39] quit drinking that are atheist there's
[3:02:41] people that have quit smoking there's
[3:02:44] people that have quit immoral uh uh
[3:02:46] living just
[3:02:49] because I'm not just talking about a
[3:02:51] Sanctified life but I'm talking about
[3:02:54] the life of Jesus Christ Living out
[3:02:57] through us that is Paul said I have no
[3:03:07] regrets brother brandom on a tape called
[3:03:09] the prison a
[3:03:12] prisoner
[3:03:14] you know sometimes we we think that we
[3:03:17] know things and we think that we
[3:03:19] remember
[3:03:21] things and when I tried to find this
[3:03:25] quote it was not
[3:03:28] there and I said
[3:03:30] I Lord lead
[3:03:38] me and my wife and I was laying on the
[3:03:42] bed here
[3:03:44] last
[3:03:45] week and I I said pull
[3:03:49] up uh Paul a
[3:03:54] prisoner she said when was it I I said
[3:03:57] well I I said I can tell you the year I
[3:03:59] I know it's 63 but I I don't know the
[3:04:03] date and and she said I'm not find it I
[3:04:06] said oh yes it
[3:04:08] is I I said wait a second I'll I'll go
[3:04:11] find it I went and got my hardbound
[3:04:15] volumes where I knew it was I had it all
[3:04:18] marked up but I didn't have this quote
[3:04:21] marked
[3:04:22] up the reason I couldn't find it is
[3:04:25] brother brandham did not say
[3:04:27] regret he said
[3:04:30] regretting but it's on the tape Paul a
[3:04:35] prisoner and he said and I I can't see
[3:04:39] here where Paul was regretting anything
[3:04:44] and saying he was sorry he was a
[3:04:46] prisoner but he was addressing himself I
[3:04:49] I believe that Paul as he wrote this
[3:04:52] letter with that pen and that it was the
[3:04:55] Holy Spirit causing him to write that
[3:04:59] amen that maybe even to this night that
[3:05:03] we might pull out the context of our
[3:05:06] text to show why Paul did this because
[3:05:10] it's scriptural and scriptural is
[3:05:14] eternal I believe that sitting in this
[3:05:18] dingy old jail that Paul wrote to his
[3:05:22] colleague here that his brother that he
[3:05:24] was a prisoner of Jesus Christ so he
[3:05:27] could express it by seeing what was
[3:05:29] around him now he was in jail but it
[3:05:33] wasn't what he was speaking to this the
[3:05:37] servant of Christ a minister with him he
[3:05:40] was speaking that he was a PRI prisoner
[3:05:44] to the word of Jesus Christ cuz Christ
[3:05:48] is the word and Paul had been a great
[3:05:52] scholar in his day and he had
[3:05:55] ambition and he was a he was a man that
[3:05:59] had been trained with by people a a
[3:06:02] fellow by the name of Gia which was the
[3:06:04] great teacher of the day one of the
[3:06:06] greatest schools that he could have went
[3:06:08] to uh for instance like we say weaton or
[3:06:11] Bob Jones or or some Fundamental school
[3:06:15] that he had been uh taught as a minister
[3:06:18] of the word and he was well educated and
[3:06:22] smart and an intelligent boy with a
[3:06:25] great ambition and maybe someday
[3:06:28] becoming a priest or a high priest to
[3:06:30] his
[3:06:30] people he had an
[3:06:34] ambition and then to
[3:06:36] find that this great ambition he had
[3:06:39] been trading for and for all of his life
[3:06:42] and maybe from the age of 8 or 10 years
[3:06:45] old up to about 30 or 35 when he
[3:06:48] finished college and graduated and had
[3:06:51] all of his diplomas and everything and
[3:06:53] stood in good with all the the clergy
[3:06:56] even to the high priest at Jerusalem he
[3:06:58] had orders from him personal orders
[3:07:01] written and trusted uh with this uh
[3:07:05] great Saul to go down to Damascus and
[3:07:08] find all those down there that worship
[3:07:10] God contrary to what he said and to bind
[3:07:13] them and to put him in jail if necessary
[3:07:16] he had orders to put them to death if he
[3:07:19] wanted to see he was he had great
[3:07:23] ambition and now all that he had been
[3:07:26] trained for God had took it all out of
[3:07:30] him
[3:07:31] see and what his objective was and what
[3:07:35] his father had spent money for and the
[3:07:38] Ambitions of his father and mother and
[3:07:42] all was taken away from him because that
[3:07:45] God had something else therefore he was
[3:07:49] a prisoner from his objective that he
[3:07:53] had in life and he had become a prisoner
[3:07:56] to Jesus Christ who was the
[3:08:00] word that road to Damascus changed Paul
[3:08:05] going down about 11:00 perhaps in the
[3:08:08] day he was stricken down and he heard a
[3:08:10] voice a voice saying Saul why
[3:08:13] persecutest thou me and he looked up and
[3:08:16] looking up being a Jew and knowed that
[3:08:19] Pillar of Fire was the Lord that led the
[3:08:23] children of Israel because he knew what
[3:08:25] it was remember that Hebrew would have
[3:08:28] never called anything Lord capital l r d
[3:08:31] Elohim unless he had been satisfied that
[3:08:35] that's what it was because he was a
[3:08:37] trained scholar and and and when he
[3:08:38] looked up and he saw this light a pillar
[3:08:40] of fire that led the the people
[3:08:44] through the Wilderness and and he said
[3:08:45] Lord Elohim capital L Lord who are you
[3:08:50] and what a surprise it must have been to
[3:08:52] this Theologian uh to to say I'm Jesus
[3:08:56] the very one he was so against oh what a
[3:08:59] turnaround oh oh it must have been
[3:09:02] something terrific for this man and all
[3:09:05] of his Ambitions that he had to find out
[3:09:09] all at once that he had been persecuting
[3:09:12] his Ambitions had driven him had drove
[3:09:16] him to farther away from the main thing
[3:09:19] that he meant to do and what a what a
[3:09:22] great shock it must have been for this
[3:09:25] Apostle when he said I am Jesus the very
[3:09:28] one he was persecuting why persecutest
[3:09:31] thou me another little quotation we
[3:09:35] might drop in here you see as they make
[3:09:37] fun of the church they're not really
[3:09:39] making fun of the church they are making
[3:09:43] fun of Jesus why persecutest thou me how
[3:09:48] could Paul then with all his intellect
[3:09:52] believe that this was that this group
[3:09:56] that he was persecuting was the very God
[3:09:59] that he claimed to be
[3:10:00] serving I think that's without going
[3:10:04] into
[3:10:05] details I think we're all well trained
[3:10:08] enough to know what I mean here the same
[3:10:12] thing
[3:10:13] is happening
[3:10:15] today Paul through
[3:10:18] ignorance was yet intelligent and smart
[3:10:21] much smarter than those uneducated
[3:10:24] galileans that he was persecuting that
[3:10:27] had already in their humility accepted
[3:10:30] this man as Lord but Paul in his great
[3:10:33] teachings and his intellectuals could
[3:10:37] not accept that what a turnaround it
[3:10:40] must have be to him on his Road and he
[3:10:43] was stricken blind that what a Turner uh
[3:10:48] not to carry out his commission but it
[3:10:51] led him down to a place in a street
[3:10:53] called straight to the house of one and
[3:10:57] then come the prophet down there by the
[3:10:58] name of ananas who saw in a vision saw
[3:11:01] him coming saw where he was at saw where
[3:11:04] he was and went in and said brother saw
[3:11:07] the Lord appeared to you on the road
[3:11:09] down sent me that I might lay my hands
[3:11:13] upon you and you receive your sight and
[3:11:16] be filled with the Holy
[3:11:23] Ghost they come to the music and just
[3:11:26] play real
[3:11:30] softly Softly and
[3:11:33] Tenderly Jesus is
[3:11:38] calling calling oh sinner come home
[3:11:43] there may not be a CER in the building I
[3:11:46] hope that there's
[3:11:47] not but if there
[3:11:50] is I'm going to tell you tonight just
[3:11:53] like I told that young
[3:11:56] lady just like I told a couple men
[3:11:59] that I had the church to pray for me
[3:12:02] when I went down after them I said I'm
[3:12:05] targeting
[3:12:08] them you may think that's a cruel way of
[3:12:10] saying it
[3:12:14] but my daddy taught me this if you aim
[3:12:17] small you miss
[3:12:19] small I was going after two
[3:12:23] souls and by the grace of God both of
[3:12:27] them came home that
[3:12:29] [Music]
[3:12:34] weekend it might be that somebody
[3:12:36] doesn't need
[3:12:38] salvation but you're just in that old
[3:12:40] gray Twilight
[3:12:43] Zone where you had a taste of the Holy
[3:12:47] Ghost and you know that it's for
[3:12:51] you but you know that you're not sealed
[3:12:54] just talking this week with an elder
[3:12:57] that he said for years he he said I knew
[3:13:00] that I'd been changed I knew that I was
[3:13:02] a different man but I did not have that
[3:13:06] seal upon my
[3:13:09] life it happens in churches all over not
[3:13:13] because we don't have good pastors we've
[3:13:15] got the best pastors the Lord Jesus told
[3:13:19] us in Jeremiah I'll give you pastors
[3:13:22] after my own heart we've got
[3:13:24] them they feed us the word of God they
[3:13:27] don't feed us their ideas they don't
[3:13:30] feed us somebody's
[3:13:31] Theological Seminary training but they
[3:13:34] feed us the pure on adulterated word of
[3:13:37] God thank God
[3:13:39] [Music]
[3:13:41] for
[3:13:43] but the Seal of the Holy Ghost is a
[3:13:45] personal
[3:13:47] relationship between you and the king of
[3:13:51] glory where we totally lay down
[3:13:57] everything our degrees don't matter
[3:14:02] anymore our Ambitions of saving up for
[3:14:06] the new Mustang don't matter
[3:14:11] anymore I've got got to win the heart of
[3:14:14] this little girl doesn't matter
[3:14:19] anymore I've got i' I I've got to look
[3:14:23] cool for that
[3:14:26] boy does not matter
[3:14:29] anymore but the only thing that
[3:14:32] matters is your relationship with the
[3:14:35] Lord Jesus Christ and him
[3:14:39] alone would there be a one everybody
[3:14:42] body just close your eyes you're not
[3:14:45] raising your hands to brother Forest
[3:14:47] brother Forest can't do one thing for
[3:14:50] you on the Seal of the Holy Ghost except
[3:14:53] to lay hands on you and
[3:14:57] pray and I've already prayed for the
[3:15:01] church I we pray that the Lord would
[3:15:03] build a hedge around you all as
[3:15:06] individuals that if you don't have the
[3:15:09] Holy Ghost that you'd be shielded from
[3:15:12] the the the work of the enemy until God
[3:15:15] can put that solid stamp of approval on
[3:15:22] you that your word is the same as his
[3:15:26] word because the bride does nothing
[3:15:30] except she has thus sayith the Lord
[3:15:36] for we've got his word for it that's why
[3:15:40] we can move with the confidence that we
[3:15:43] move you just want to raise your hand
[3:15:45] and say oh brother I I I I know I've got
[3:15:49] something because I'm not the same but
[3:15:52] but I don't know that I've got that seal
[3:15:55] but Lord I want no regrets when I leave
[3:15:59] this building
[3:16:02] tonight because I know that you were
[3:16:05] here we were talking about the Lord and
[3:16:09] wherever that we talk about him he comes
[3:16:12] that sweetness that we feel here tonight
[3:16:16] that's
[3:16:18] him we've been Witnesses of it all day
[3:16:21] long all weekend
[3:16:25] long he's
[3:16:27] here and he's here for you it's not by
[3:16:31] chance that we come
[3:16:35] together it's not by chance that I'm 800
[3:16:39] miles away from home it's not by chance
[3:16:42] that some of these brothers have come in
[3:16:47] distance
[3:16:49] no it's him he's brought us together and
[3:16:55] can you not hear him just wooing over
[3:16:57] you the there the
[3:17:01] words those are words that the psalmist
[3:17:05] David under
[3:17:07] inspiration crying out the words of the
[3:17:11] Lord Jesus wouldn't bring down years
[3:17:13] later oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I
[3:17:18] would have gathered you together I would
[3:17:21] have covered you over with my wings the
[3:17:24] way that a mama chicken would cover up
[3:17:27] her
[3:17:29] brute that's what he's doing now even
[3:17:32] through the brother listen to the music
[3:17:36] the the the sweetness of the song that
[3:17:39] that my brother's
[3:17:41] playing
[3:17:42] he may not even have that ability of
[3:17:45] himself although he's talented but
[3:17:47] there's something coming through the
[3:17:49] music that it's more than just a Yamaha
[3:17:55] piano if he's calling out to
[3:18:00] you oh don't turn him
[3:18:04] away it's his desire he Longs
[3:18:10] more for us to have have that seal of
[3:18:13] God in our life and we are even to ask
[3:18:17] you for
[3:18:19] it he wants everyone in this building to
[3:18:24] step into that
[3:18:26] adoption you heard the prayer
