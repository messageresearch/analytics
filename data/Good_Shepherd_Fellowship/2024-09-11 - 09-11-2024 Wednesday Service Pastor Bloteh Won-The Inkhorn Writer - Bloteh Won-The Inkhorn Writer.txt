you know uh when you are that much a good preacher you always try to find a way to uh to be blessed in your chamber as you study praise the Lord I'll tell you I will tell you just how much I I thought about I thought about 911 today I don't know if I've if I've had a privilege to to have a service on the on the night of 9 11 so I was thinking I was thinking as is uh uh how can I preach on 911 I thought about brother Brandon talking about uh uh uh Peter harber and uh I just it just couldn't fit into my inspiration or fit into my thought for the message so as I was as I was just thinking about it I thought okay even if I can't preach on 911 I'm going to look for uh the ninth chapter in the Bible with uh with a uh uh with with chapter 9 verse 11 that will bring uh a good sense to the evening so Ezekiel chapter 9 and it turned out that Ezekiel chapter 9 has only 11 verses praise the Lord amen it turned out that Ezekiel chapter 9 has only 11 verses so tonight I want to speak on a little talk that I I entitled The Ink honn writer the ink honn writer the ink honn writer Ezekiel chapter 99 we know how this chapter is very famous uh because uh we have been reminded over and over how uh them their sight and cry for the Abomination that was done in the city they were sealed that evening so let's just read a little bit here chapter n he cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have have charged over the city to draw n even every man with his destroying weapon in his hands I follow that a little bit those that have charge over the city those that have charge they they have a they have a duty uh either either to protect or to punish those that have charge over the city and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lie towards the North and every man with slaughtering weapons in his hand six that's the number of men every man with slaughtering weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed in laning with a writer ink horn so that's why we title it tonight the inor writer praise the Lord with a wrer inome by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen altar praise the Lord so there were six men and these six men they all had slaughtering weapons but the seventh man he he had an ink horn by his side are we together let's bow our heads and pray Heavenly Father father we just want to thank you tonight Lord we pray that the holy spirit will come and take the service from you we place it into your hands we place our hearts and mind into your hands Lord May something be said father that will encourage us tonight we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat thank you for coming tonight praise the Lord as we continue to trust the Lord to bring more uh healing uh uh you know to to uh our Wednesday night service praise the Lord and uh so uh we want to talk on this uh Inon Rider uh uh I had another uh verse I wanted to read that First Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 we want to read 1 Peter chapter 1 praise the Lord and uh in 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 17 1 Peter chapter 1 verse1 17 you love the Lord amen praise the Lord okay I think I wrote something different than what I should have but let's go ahead tonight and what we wanted to pick up uh uh right there in in First Peter is where Peter talks about uh you know uh if the righteous will be scarcely saved that's why we wanted to pickup judgment begin in the house of the Lord and uh that's what we wanted to read there in uh first Peter praise the Lord so uh uh and also this this weekend we will be gone and uh we'll be be preaching for brother Jordan's father uh uh Friday night and Saturday night and Sunday morning so I ask uh that you you keep us in your prayer praise the Lord uh sister s myself would be gone but Dan will speak for us on Sunday night so I mean on Sunday morning so you keep him in prayer as well praise the Lord now so uh we want to talk about this in hon Rider year and uh uh just just I mean just looking at uh uh you know the the time that uh is upon us the time that we are living in you know uh as just like I said as the contct remember what happened uh uh you know uh uh September 11 2021 we want to remind ourself we want to remind ourself as Believers we want to remind ourself that uh uh we are living in an hour where the Bible says that uh Darkness will be upon the Earth and grow Darkness Ness upon the people praise the lord we are living in an hour where Zachariah spoke about when he said that uh you know well in the evening time there shall be light we are living in a time where you know this is prophesied about uh where the Judgment of God will be upon the Earth praise the Lord amen Paul speaks about that in the Book of Romans you know when the way we seeing the you know the the the generation is going the people are going crazy and you know uh uh uh uh Paul bring out something in the Book of Romans where he says that uh God will pour out his raft Upon A people that would not acknowledge Him as the Creator now you have to realize that Redemption is only to the El amen Redemption is only to the El but God is the creator of the universe so he must have a way to witness to people that are not his elect praise the Lord so that's the reason why the heavens declare the glory of God the Earth shows his handwork praise the Lord so you see that's why Paul said that in Romans chapter 1 that even the the the the invisible things of God are made known by the things that we do see praise the Lord now so he says if if if uh if if men will see the handed work of God if they will see if men cannot be able to tell that there is an intelligence behind the rising of the Sun and and the changing of the weather you know uh and and and everything that we have around us you know if man will not be able to acknowledge God as the creator of the universe praise the Lord he says the wrath of God is going to come upon those people praise the Lord and in the way that God will P his judgment on the on that generation will be in the way where he will make them to do things like they are crazy amen they will abuse thems they will change their forms they will change their gender that's exactly what Paul addressed that in Romans chapter 1 so when we see all of these things around us just like we said on on Sunday it must not throw us off we must realize that we we are we are ined out of judgment it's almost just like uh I believe that uh uh uh uh the children of Israel there in the land of Gan they were hearing the yelling and the crying from the land of Egypt praise the Lord amen and then and and and I mean some of those boys knew the the first born that were dead in Egypt the knew that when Moses came back and and and and and commanded the the children of Israel to put the blood on on on the door post and told them the death angel will pass tonight he's going to visit the Egypt and and and and he will he was he would kill all their firstborn praise the Lord it was a serious issue I believe fathers came back they set their family down the the the they rehears brother said in talking he said the firstborn will come to the daddy and say Daddy are you sure the blood is applying yeah are you sure that you put the blood on the Len of the door post because he knew that if it was not there he will also die praise the Lord amen you see when uh when when when this manifestation is happening even the Egyptians they were crying to Pharaoh let the people go they could see that this this this is not a magic trick they could see that this was the hand of God praise the Lord amen a lot of the things that is happening around us is the hand of God praise the Lord amen even the coldness and uh and the backsliding and uh and uh uh and the division and people turning away from the message is the hand of God because the word of God said it it's the hour that we are living because the word of God said it praise the Lord but we want to remind ourself tonight that the inor rider is still in the camp amen the inor rider is stay goinging by he stay speaking to your conscience he stay knocking to your heart do he he he want to write the Commandments of God upon your heart the Bible call him the inkhorn rider the Bible says he was going to put a mark amen praise the Lord amen he was going to put a mark and when you put a mark you make an impression the word of God makes must make an impression on our heart praise the Lord the word might affect us we here to remind ourself tonight that the Inon Rider is still in the camp amen praise the Lord why the six men are going and slaughtering everywhere that's why we hear every day on the news if if it is not a car jack if it is not an adoption if it is not some kind of a horrible thing but every day on the news the slaughtering Angel is going about praise the Lord but there was there's a group of people that were waiting for the inor r to come their way amen there was a group of people that was waiting for the inor rider to come their way way this is Wednesday night so uh there there's not a whole lot here uh we just want to remind you praise the Lord SE of god let's take this it will give us our picture yet and then we will go go on tonight he says now watch the prophet in the spirit he's talking about Ezekiel now now wash the prophet in the spirit taken up into glory and God said I'm going to show you how I'm going to settle it with the Jews before coming to the Gentiles now so God was showing Ezekiel here how he's going to close this whole thing up with the Jews amen because there was a gentile people that he had to call out for his his name sake praise the Lord because brother Braham told us that this prophecy of Ezekiel chapter 9 actually took place at the destruction of Jerusalem when when when when uh Titus the Roman general captured the city that was when Ezekiel 9 actually fulfilled praise the Lord amen amen so the man with the in home rather was the Lord Jesus Christ that was already that was already on the earth and giving the people this word writing on their heart and giving them a promise T until you are endu with power and he says that there when you flee to the mountain don't come back and brother B says every one of them that hear his word they escape the judgment why because the Inon rather word impresses their heart he put a mark on them are we together that was the physical that was the ler fulfillment of Ezekiel chapter 9 but let's look at this to together yeah just follow me now as we as we as we read and and fellowship together I'm going to show you how I'm going to settle it with the Jews before the coming of the any time read the verse or the chapter before it read the chapter before Ezekiel 9 that's what we want to do tonight praise the Lord because you see what is happening here this is going to give us a picture to show how the glory how the shakana glory that came down in the Temple of Solomon That Glory that filled the place that even the preacher couldn't have a place to speak how the glory departed if you go go back in in chapter 8 you will see literally how the glory departed and is a type for us how the glory is departing from people let's go back and and then we will study a little bit there so let's go back and read the chapter before it chapter 8 let's go to chapter 8 praise the Lord amen Ezekiel chapter 8 we can you can fall back like that when you when you get home and you know you can read uh the entire chapter but uh uh from verse one and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the fifth day of the month I sat in my house and the Elders of Judah sat before me that the hand of the Lord fell there upon me praise the Lord now we are going to read a scenario word Ezekiel is sitting with the Elders of Israel and he's going to be transported now you will see the example that we talk about of Revelation chapter 4 when the angel told John come up higher I will show you things amen praise the Lord so he say he's sitting down there and the the others of of of of Judah are sitting before him and he said that the hand of the hand of the Lord God fell dead upon me then I beheld and low the likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his Lans even downward fire and from his Leon even upward as the appearance of of brightness as the color of amber that same pillow of fire that was taken over brother bram's head amber color light so he said he's sitting there and what he's seeing there is that he start to see a man he's seeing a being there from the upper part it's a fire like but with Amber C amen amen and he put forth and he put forth the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my hand and the spirit lifted me up between the Earth and the heavens and brought me in the vision of God to Jerusalem to the door of the inner gate are we together where where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoked to jealousy now you have to realize that after the time of Manet he brought Israel in such a time of idol worship praise the Lord he polluted the land with idol worship until just like our age that we day and age that we are living in we worship brain name we worship uh uh uh I mean uh everything everything that's the spirit of the age the way we get excited and the energy that we that that that this age have uh to to all the different things if if if a portion of that was put before behind the name of God the church will be a step higher than where we are praise the Lord amen the image of jealousy just meaning that this was something that was replacing God to the people remember he says I'm a jealous God don't have no graving image and here Ezekiel is transported in the spirit and he's brought right right to the beginning the entrance of the city idolatry started right from the entrance of the city I was doing some uh study on the Statue of Liberty I don't I want to get into that tonight but that's one of the first thing when you fly in the US you see but let's go on are we together amen right from the entrance of the setting an image of jealousy which Pro which provoketh to jealousy and behold the glory of go the glory of the god of Israel was there I calling to the vision that I saw in the plane then said he unto me some son of man lift up th eyes now and wait towards the N so I lifted up my eyes and wa towards the North and behold north wall the Gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry and he said furthermore unto me son of man see where there what they do even the Great Abomination that the house of Israel committed here that I should go far off from my Dwelling Place he saying because of the great Abomination that my that my uh uh my exit of people my redeemed people because of the great Abomination I'm bringing you to see see why my spirit is going to leave why my glory is going to leave the people will have a form of godliness they will have a form they will call themselves different names but my glory is not there are we together now he's bringing he's bringing Ezekiel inovision just imagine he's sitting down right there right there with all of the ERS of of of Judah and he's been transported praise the Lord amen glory be to God even the great Abomination that the house of is Israel committed year that I should go far off from my Century but turn thee yet again and thou shall see greater Abomination now you see you this is the setting of why chapter n had to take place why there had to be great slaughtering in chapter n this is the setting of of it yeah wow are we together and he brought me to the door of the court now you have to remember now we said we said door in Revelation chapter 4 is a further Revelation you're going to see how Ezekiel is experiencing for forther Revelation because it is not just a physical do God he's traveling in the Spirit he's not opening doors with his hands but he's going through doors and as he goes through doors God reveal more things to him God reveal more abominable things to him are we together then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when I have dig in the wall Behold a door he's in a vision the Lord is telling him dig in the wall and as you dig in a wall there's a vision I mean there's a door praise the Lord let's go a little bit and he said unto me go in and Behold The Wicked Abomination that they do here so I went in and S and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the House of Israel amen portrayed upon the wall around about praise the Lord now remember now in Prophecy brother Brown says God this is giving us a picture how God is going to close the Gentile book to turn I mean the Jewish book to turn to the Gentiles the prop God said uh uh uh uh uh uh beginning ending of GTI dispensation you know where it begins with an idol worship it will go out with the same praise the Lord amen like we said before idolatry has been something that haunted the church right from the beginning God brought our father uh uh Abraham out of the house of idol worship praise the Lord Jacob was leaving with his wife uh Rachel and Leah she stole her father Idol and if there is one thing that is him in the church is all the idols that we are holding to in our mind in our spirit some people that I mean they worship certain form of teachings that they cannot go no farther than that when a person has has sat on a legalistic preaching so long sometimes it can be a form of worship you cannot meet up with that you condemn yourself you see other people you condemn also you condemn them what is happening because in your mind this is what the message is like some will say I mean I mean when you go to a message Church there a way we should be able to identify it well how should we identify a message Church a message Church Must Be identified by the message of the hour and the spirit of God Among the people that's how we must identify the message Church Let It Be identified by the message of the hour the word of God that is preached and the spirit of God that is among the people am are we together now he's bringing all of these things and showing Ezekiel all of these creeping things and abominable beasts you know and and Idols you know you find it in the people homes they said look in their homes but here here is the thing the people are going to the temple the priests are going to the temple when it is time to worship they all gather to worship but their spirit and their mind is all caught up in idolatry that the worship of God is just a form we want to get there quick we want to get out of there because we get better things to do are we together amen don't worry I won't keep you all night tonight amen it's just that we have we have to wake up ourself we have to wake up ourself just like I said because the in home Rider is in every service praise the Lord the inor rider is in every service and he want to seal you praise the Lord and the Seal of the Holy Ghost is to seal out every form of adolat the only thing we worship is the word the word must have the preeminence we must bring it back to the word now in the vision verse 11 there stood before them 70 men of the Asians of the House of Israel in the mid to there the ERS God is taking Ezekiel in a vision seeing the elders the men what is happening to our churches all the men are gone all the men are gone lishia Church age is filled with women you find more women than the men they are all gone they can never rise up to the the place to become deacons to become leaders they canot it's a dysfunction in the way that God structure in God's structure because the enemy knows these are the people that supposed to be the leaders that's right if we can WEP them away then we don't have leaders praise the Lord but yet they are the ones that can come sit down and argue they come and F they are oldtimers praise the Lord amen that's the thing that is happening to our societies men they are all slacking on their responsibility the he the Asians are all caught up in adolat the land is vulnerable oh that's not the worst here you will see the worst because Ezekiel said there is more abominable things the angel to him more abominable things I Will Show You Follow Me You Love the Lord that's that's what the prophet to us to do he said read a chapter before that's what we are doing praise the Lord amen hallelujah verse 12 then then said he unto me Son of God have thou seen what the Ancients of the House of Israel do in the dark every man in his chamber praise the Lord all of these guys in their little in their little closet their little they having their little Idol well they worship because they want to be better than the next man when these are the when these are the men that's supposed to be holding the Tabernacle together praise the Lord [Music] every man in the chamber of his imagry for they said the Lord Sear us not the Lord has forsaken the Earth but yet these are the same people when it is Sabbath day they in their white garment everyone want their own white to sh in the next person and they can tell you I I've been in this Tabernacle long time my my grandfather was in this Tabernacle one time but back there in his mind God has forsaken the Earth having the form of godliness denying the power of God if the spirit of judgment is on the earth that's the very same thing that is happening and that's the very same thing that is happening around our message churches and then we want to complain we can't see the power of God what what brother the power of God is still here because the man with the with the ink horn he stay here praise the Lord he said also unto me turn turn thee again and see and and and thou shall see greater Abomination that the D and he brought me to the door of the gates of the Lord's House which was towards the North and behold there sat the women weeping for Timon that that was another ad ad worship the god of uh uh fertility it was a kind of a sexual God that they worship and the ween weeping is that not is that not the spirit that is consuming this age they all want to be sexy that's the thing that is eating your mind up praise the Lord then he said unto men have thou seen this oh son of man turn thee again yet again and thou shall see greater Abomination than this and he brought me into the inner chamber of the Lord and behold at the door of the the Temple of the Lord and between the porch and the altar where about five and 20 men 5 and 20 men go back to the book of Chronicle when when when David was placing the priest he placed it there the man in the the the man the the priest in the Tabernacle will be 24 he was was taking it from the place of the 24 others so it will be 24 priests and the high priest make them 25 here in a vision God is showing Ezekiel the priest and the high priest the men of the Tabernacle the men that supposed to be holding the fire of God right Invision what about five and 24 men with their back turned to the Temple of the of the Lord and their face towards the east and they worship the son towards the east they turn their back to the temple praise the Lord they want Miracles they want discernment so they start going into all sorts of mystical things they turn their back to the temple worshiping the son and this Men supposed to be the the the the the people holding the fire of God but they turn their back to the temple and they are worshiping the son praise Lord am turn your back to the message of the hour and they are looking in every place because they want to be revelated they want to be you know they want great followers praise the Lord just reading the message yesterday never T about it but in the message uh uh presence of the Lord the prophet of God said something and it just it I mean it just it just convicted me I was doing some work at home and uh uh he says he says and and we ministers I could find that for you I think I copyed it somewhere it says and we ministers we are to bring the presence of God to the people the ministry is not just court it's not just an opportunity for people to listen to us we must bring the presence of God to the people that's right and to do that we must be able to spend time with God we must be able to spend time with God preaching the message is easy very easy see what the prophet said it's very easy it's very easy it's there online they turned their back to the Tabernacle praise the Lord just talking with a a young man and encouraging him and tell him and said look I was I was you know just trying to talk to him and uh uh so you find it I mean denomination they keep people by giving them office the order of the word is God see you doing the work he see you in the line of duty praise the Lord Saul was going to look for his father that was lost he was about looking for his father David was keeping his father sheep God found you in the acts of Duty T I said you can be the best musician it's not going to be a blessing to us just to have you come and play music on Sunday and then uh we can't see you we don't know the life that you are living just because we want members or we want musicians are we together with your back turned towards the Temple of the Lord and the their faces towards the east and they worship the son towards the east then he said unto me have thou seen this son of man is it a lie think to the house of Judah that they commit the Abomination they commit the Abomination which they committed year for they have filled the land with violence and have turn to provoke me to anger and L they put the branch to their nose therefore will I also de in my FY my eyes shall not spare neither will I have pity praise the Lorden the reason why God instituted the church Jesus said you will be a city on the hell the position position of the church the position of the believer is to be in a place of influence is to be in the place of influence and it's not because we believe brother Brandon what we baptize in Jesus name you got to keep yourself a life of consecration praise the Lord you got to be truth to God in your heart there's no time to play religion no time to play the a church praise the Lord the inong rer comes all the time to seal us with the Holy Ghost but sometime our mind is not there sometimes just one thing he want to grab your attention on Spring get a hold of it embrace th word and say Lord you spoke to me deal with me change my life therefore where I deal for then my eyes shall not spare neither will I have pity and D the cry my ears though the cry in my ears with a loud voice yet will I not hear them praise the Lord amen what is what what is the church word on oh let's just fast you know fast fast fast fast fast you can impress God praise the Lord amen our body is the temple and here's these people you're defiling the temple can you imagine you just think about it like brother BR says he said just passing the other days I saw the pastor and all the men in the church standing at the backside smoking cigarette to smoke and then when they finish smoking they come back in the church they the leaders of the church they come in to lead the people in worship and they all standing there there smoking cigarette or we carrying the people now we get in our our uh Ezekiel chapter 9 we already get the background that's the background why these six men were sent into the city that is the background because idoling has eaten the people up and the glory of God was going away was going away the things that used to to to capture our heart and and and conscientise us we have grown over it they don't bother us anymore he cried also in my ear with a loud voice saying cause them to have the charge over the city to draw near even every man with a destroying weapon praise the Lord remember there there in Revelation he says hold the four wings of the earth until I seal these ones with the seed of God on their head that's the in Horn Rider amen he want his word to be to be impressed upon our heart write his word on the table of our heart that's the reason why he comes with that ink are we together praise the lord it's easy to sit back you sit back you can see all the fault of the drivers you can see uh you know all the uh uh uh you know and everything that is going wrong it's it's it's easy but get yourself into it are we together that's the spirit of the age is everywhere it's everywhere everywhere talking about the manifestation of the sons of God Brothers Love there because it's their sons so the love they the manifestation of the sons of God it's not it's not our dress code that's not what Adam was doing in the Garden of Eden he was not just you know dressing nice he was putting things in place he was govering he was ruling he had things subjected to him praise the Lord and that's what the Holy Ghost want to do in our life no matter how things goes and uh how how how how how how crazy work can be and schedule can be we know our post of Duty as a Son of God as a daughter of God you you you must know your post of Duty why because it's something you are cultivating in your heart you will never be able to give it if you don't have it that's right you won't give it you are cultivating it in your heart praise the Lord now so let's just go down a little bit and then we we kind of for close this so I giv you I giv you the background you know all about uh uh uh uh Ezekiel chapter 9 you you can read it you you know we have read it we have preached over it over and over I just wanted to give you this background and just to show you know uh uh that was the thing that took the glory of God away from the people idolatry idolatry when we when when we when we when we getting ourself involved in things and it's not it's not capturing our heart anymore we are not really able to get before the Lord and and uh uh uh and and wash his feet with tears we are not able to do it it's not just it's not just a walk out let's let's just read and I try to find a place to close here but B says he says read the verse or the chapter before it now when he come in here first he saw sin in the city like he had never saw before God taking the prophet into another realing to see the spirit that was hindering the move of God Among the people praise the Lord God has brought us a mighty long way this church praise the Lord the power of God has deal with us in different ways and we are such a unique group that if God can just get us to where he want us to be praise the Lord right amen just get us to where he want us to be this word is above every one of us this word praise the Lord you see sometimes we get so common to one another we know the history of the church we know oh how this person came oh what we know about this person and we take that to be what God is doing praise the Lord

of every man every woman boy and girl we have our young people that needs the Holy Ghost living in a challenging age praise the Lord living in a challenging age we ourselves with our age we can't even deal with the things that they are dealing with praise the Lord we want the the the the the the the inor rer writer to write upon their heart right upon their mind where they can develop their own experience with the Lord their own time of praying their own time of meditation praise the Lord that is the greatest gift we can give them expose them to the presence of God Amen every man every woman

destroying the life of of young people they sit right in the church sit under the word of God and the parent will find out they will find out that their child is married when it just came from the court they have no idea of who they are moving they will find out that their child is married because they post it on Facebook these are serious stuff this are life thing we are talking about I'm not

amen why because the glory has gone the thing that that brought us here we have left it right the thing that we come here to worship it has become different we have our favorite preacher we have our sty of preaching we have our favorite thing that we like to hear all has become Idol when we need to go beyond that and let God become real to us that we can hear his voice in the singing of the birds we can hear his voice in the blowing of the wi we can we can we can hear his voice in the beauty of the flower and even if there's a special that is sign we can hear God's voice praise the Lord amen

and when they are in their place it it becomes a blessing the Lord enjoy it or what are we going to do we start finding for a scripture or Court where we can find Deacon NES you find you find bunch of M churches around they can't find a deacon because men can't step up they can't commit themselves to to to to to to what the word require him to do because there's a qualification that the word says it it's not just an office to fill that we say oh yeah brother Joe you know we need a deacon in this church just become a deacon no there a word requirement that's right and you can't find it praise the Lord just like we said the last time oh we were just yeah we having spiritual communion we take uh H H uh the Holiness from the church because why the preacher feel guilty to take communion the

get through everything we read I just want to have two calls to share with you I just wanted to bring bring us to the place and realize people this is our church if Jesus Ted many of our young people here will get married whether they will stay here whether they will go somewhere else well I mean it will be it will be to their choice praise the Lord if Jesus starred many of the babies that are born we will see them growing up uh they will be become musicians you will become but if we are not dedicating ourself to what we are doing here amen if there is not a trust on our heart that this is
