[14:22] opportunity that we can call upon his
[14:25] name we can rest in the promise that
[14:28] data call upon the name of the law
[14:30] we'll be safe tonight before we go into
[14:34] the service have a prayer burden year
[14:39] and this morning while we were praying
[14:47] having our home devotion and I just I
[14:51] just thought about I was kind of
[14:54] thinking about missionaries I had
[14:56] missionaries on my mind this morning and
[15:00] I was thinking with I mean the airport
[15:04] the worst shutdown
[15:05] let me say that waiting and all the
[15:09] traveling restriction and all of that
[15:11] and because you know the the calling is
[15:15] actually a burden you know so you think
[15:20] about it
[15:21] missionaries that are reaching out to
[15:24] souls in different area and they having
[15:28] this burden on the AHA and and they can
[15:32] now be able to get on the plane and
[15:34] travel overseas and or whether they have
[15:39] to to you know get you a jungle or
[15:42] whether they have to get on the street
[15:44] and they just have that burden on their
[15:47] heart you know because God is not going
[15:49] to port his ball his burden on pause
[15:52] because the world is shot down you know
[15:56] and I was just thinking about that this
[15:58] morning and I said oh my goodness you
[16:00] know so while we were praying I know our
[16:04] just a bit birding and praying for
[16:08] different missionary
[16:09] Lord there's part of all of that I know
[16:12] you are still helping your people in
[16:15] whichever way they can be able to get
[16:17] across you know two souls and and then
[16:20] thinking about even those that are you
[16:24] know testifier and sharing their the
[16:26] gospel they had never come in contact
[16:29] with the message they are only carrying
[16:31] the name of Jesus Christ telling someone
[16:34] that Jesus died for their sin in all of
[16:36] this you know I was just praying for
[16:38] those different ones this morning and
[16:40] then I got a call from idea saying that
[16:45] otomí of a report of some of the
[16:49] missionary brothers in China you know
[16:54] being arrested you know I mean I think
[16:57] China is now cracking down on most of
[17:00] those home churches you know in or there
[17:03] and I think that report also came
[17:05] through clover there because cover their
[17:08] works with many of those believers you
[17:11] know so there are three of them that
[17:13] were arrested in prison I think one is
[17:16] out of prison and there are two that are
[17:19] that are there so we want to just
[17:24] remember those those things in in
[17:28] different things that are in different
[17:30] situation so let's just go to the Lord
[17:33] in prayer and let's just play Libby beer
[17:36] leave it the elastic for birdies tonight
[17:40] brother Andrews also told me that he
[17:44] lost his grandmother back home so we
[17:47] want to pray for their family and all
[17:50] the preparation that we are making back
[17:53] that the grace of God will be able to
[17:55] just comfort them in difficult times
[17:58] whatever burden that is on your heart
[18:01] let's just use this time these few
[18:04] meanings and just take our heart to the
[18:06] throne of grace and and just speak to
[18:09] the Lord
[18:10] and I mean we can just talk to him as
[18:13] our friend as I was Savior as I walked
[18:17] our Lord the lover of our soul

[28:20] Philippians and Philippians chapter 2 so
[28:36] we want to speak from tonight
[28:54] praise the Lord
[29:06] I was I was let's read the scripture and
[29:10] then we will we find Philip in Chapter
[29:16] two let's read from verse one if there
[29:20] be therefore any consolation in Christ
[29:23] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[29:26] of the Spirit if any bowels and mercy
[29:31] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[29:35] having the same love being of one Accord
[29:40] of one mind let nothing be done through
[29:45] strife or vainglory but in lowliness of
[29:51] mind let each esteem other better than
[29:56] himself is there at seven one another as
[30:00] we as we serve God look not every man on
[30:05] his own thing but every man also on the
[30:09] things of others let this mind be in you
[30:12] which was in Christ Jesus who being in
[30:17] the form of God thought it not robbery
[30:21] to be equal with God but made himself of
[30:27] no reputation and took upon him the form
[30:33] of a seven and was made in the likeness
[30:36] of men and being found in fashion as a
[30:43] man he humbled himself and became
[30:46] obedient unto death even the death of
[30:50] the cross amen Heavenly Father we
[30:56] approach your word now and in acts the
[30:59] laws you will come and use these few
[31:02] meanings before us and speak to us Lord
[31:06] we are so grateful father God we can be
[31:11] able to come in reference to your word
[31:14] you have given us a hat to believe Lord
[31:17] so to receive
[31:19] so God coming see Austin I speak to us
[31:23] Lord we love you and we appreciate you
[31:26] in Jesus name we pray amen
[31:31] the Lord bless you may have your seat I
[31:34] want to talk speak on I thought that I
[31:39] was I was thinking about that I entitled
[31:44] playing God we have to realize there as
[31:58] I had a prophecy God said his glory he
[32:03] will share with no man and and the
[32:08] reason why I came to this thought was on
[32:10] this scripture that we have just read I
[32:13] was reading something as some believers
[32:17] were fellowshiping you know in you know
[32:20] in all of these social media fellowship
[32:23] you know sharing thoughts and sharing
[32:25] coats you know in different thing wish
[32:28] of course they were they were very
[32:30] beautiful beautiful but this is where I
[32:33] thought that that caught my attention on
[32:37] this on the scripture were the Apostle
[32:43] Paul said were been in a form of God
[32:46] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[32:50] God I might be maybe is is because of
[32:56] you know my level of understanding or I
[33:00] might be wrong in the way that I
[33:03] perceive the conversation but most of
[33:06] the time this trip sure is it's taught
[33:10] off as if you know Jesus our Lord Jesus
[33:18] you know looking at the phrase here
[33:22] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[33:26] God I think maybe is the word equal that
[33:31] makes
[33:32] many people to think that the Apostle
[33:35] Paul was saying that Jesus never wanted
[33:40] to make himself equal with God but I
[33:43] don't think that's what he was saying
[33:47] you know I don't think that's what he
[33:50] was saying because jesus said I am the
[33:54] father I want so Paul was not saying
[34:00] that Jesus even though he was he was God
[34:04] but he never wanted to be equal with God
[34:07] I think what the Apostle Paul was saying
[34:10] here is that he never taught it robbery
[34:14] he never taught calling himself god or
[34:17] the son of God he was robbing God of
[34:20] anything praise the Lord and because
[34:26] many times people think they're you know
[34:32] this Holy Ghost gospel robbed you know
[34:37] God is not a robbery I think over and
[34:40] over in his word he France at robbers
[34:43] you know and God would not rob any man
[34:48] because you know sometimes the state of
[34:51] robbery is the other the person that you
[34:55] are robbing is better than you a mean
[34:58] even if they don't have nothing but for
[35:02] you to just put them to a place where
[35:04] you have to rob them of what they have
[35:05] is it's a sign that they are better than
[35:07] you but you know God will not rob a man
[35:12] you know of anything and I don't think
[35:16] they're poor men there and but that's
[35:19] there that is what I was hearing in the
[35:22] conversation and so a caught my mind I
[35:25] decided to go back to the scripture that
[35:27] decided to read it meditate upon it and
[35:29] so it was on my mind so I thought about
[35:31] okay I would just speak on there tonight
[35:34] I know I have spoken on on the message
[35:37] taught it now robbery you know thinking
[35:41] it now robbery you know I mean desiring
[35:45] the Holy Ghost you are
[35:46] robbing God brother branham see is just
[35:48] like that the fish in the water you know
[35:52] trying being afraid to drink because if
[35:55] he's like you know the ocean might go
[35:58] dry you know but it's in and we are
[36:02] dwelling in an inexhaustible fountain
[36:04] that can never goes dry so I believe
[36:08] that the Apostle Paul year was saying
[36:11] for us let us let this mind be in you
[36:16] this this mind should beating us just
[36:19] like it was in Christ Jesus and he being
[36:23] in the form of God thought it not
[36:25] robbery you know as children of God you
[36:29] know to believe there we can rob our
[36:32] Father there will be a wrong taught you
[36:35] know we can never rob God everything we
[36:38] have he has given it to us you know and
[36:41] he gave it to us for us to be able to
[36:43] use it for his glory you know so Paul is
[36:47] encouraging us that we should have this
[36:50] mind that was in Christ and the mind I
[36:53] was in Christ is there whatever we Acts
[36:57] of the Father he would give it to us the
[37:00] mind I was in Christ is dead the father
[37:03] want his children to be just like him
[37:09] praise Lord the mind I was in Christ is
[37:14] that he he did nothing except the father
[37:17] revealed to him he want this mind to be
[37:21] in us he want us to grow in a statue
[37:25] where we have come to this place to
[37:27] understand that we are attributes of God
[37:32] we are children sons and daughters of
[37:34] God and we must be able to reflect the
[37:38] nature of God we must be able to live a
[37:41] life that man will see the goodness of
[37:45] God and glorify our Father so let this
[37:48] mind be in you let this mind be in you
[37:55] that you get to the place word you will
[37:58] never think it robbery
[38:01] to be equal to God praise the Lord now
[38:06] but as we look at this together I would
[38:10] want us to to go over to to Genesis
[38:15] chapter 3 I think that's where the
[38:19] problem is because the Bible led us to
[38:23] know that God made man in His image
[38:27] you know and in his likeness he breathed
[38:31] into man and man became a living soul
[38:35] you know so he made us that we must we
[38:40] might look just like him you know I was
[38:43] I was I was plain as all song of the
[38:47] life fountains is the song says speaks
[38:55] of family resemblance
[38:57] you know it says you look just like your
[39:00] daddy you know family resemblance that's
[39:02] that's a beautiful song I think that
[39:04] kind of a wrote down the chorus I think
[39:08] it you know when I enjoy family
[39:10] resemblance you know the father want us
[39:13] to look just like him praise the Lord
[39:16] so when we get over here in Genesis
[39:19] chapter 3 we realize there is there is
[39:23] something there that I you know I can't
[39:26] afford the caught my attention here
[39:28] I know we have talked about it before is
[39:33] what happened over there in the Garden
[39:35] of Eden and we would get into this
[39:38] conversation you know the serpent
[39:41] speaking to the woman you know and a
[39:44] woman answering back to the 7
[39:53] reading from verse one now the serpent
[39:56] was more subtil anti beasts of the field
[39:59] which the Lord God has made and he said
[40:02] unto the woman yea hath God said ye
[40:04] shall not eat of every tree of the
[40:07] garden and the woman said unto the
[40:12] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[40:15] tree of the garden but of the fruit of
[40:17] the tree wishes in the midst of the
[40:20] garden God hath said ye shall eat of it
[40:25] neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[40:32] you know I was also thinking about
[40:34] Revelation chapter 5 if you go in
[40:36] Revelation chapter 5 and it starts to
[40:39] talk about the book of Redemption they
[40:42] similar words I'd use you know a book
[40:44] that no man was walking you know to look
[40:48] upon no man was water to handle you know
[40:51] to to touch and and in one of you but
[40:55] I'm not going to tonight and the serpent
[40:57] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[41:00] die for God does know that the vanie
[41:05] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[41:08] and ye shall be as God's knowing good
[41:13] and evil
[41:15] now we know they were made in the image
[41:19] of God they were made in the likeness of
[41:22] God so they were the children of God
[41:24] they were they were they were amateur
[41:26] girls that's what we know because Adam
[41:29] could speak you know and he was the one
[41:32] that named the things in the garden and
[41:34] out of there we know that they were but
[41:37] you see there was something that was
[41:38] playing out here and that's what I want
[41:41] to bring our mind to tonight I believe
[41:44] that the enemy by his life he robbed
[41:48] Adam Eve of that garlic in image that he
[41:52] had their innocent mind they had to only
[41:55] do the will of the father because there
[41:59] was something playing out here he says
[42:02] here that for god knows day
[42:06] the damn you either of your eyes shall
[42:09] be opened and ye shall be as God's
[42:13] knowing good and evil
[42:15] now we know also over in the Book of
[42:21] Isaiah you know
[42:23] Lucifer desire to ascend his throne
[42:26] above the stars of God to be worshipped
[42:29] as God you know he appalled let us know
[42:32] in the book of Corinthians and he's the
[42:34] god of this evil age but this is what I
[42:37] wanted to bring us tonight let's just
[42:40] read some few things here from brother
[42:41] Branham and making emphasis on on the
[42:45] Philippian scripture verbatim said in a
[42:48] message he saw by himself he says now
[42:52] has God I mean he says now God has made
[42:57] a promise and he he told Abraham what he
[43:00] would do he took his heart he saw by
[43:05] himself no greater so God himself
[43:09] oh there he was in the pillar of fire he
[43:15] was in Christ Jesus all that he was in
[43:21] the pillar of fire he was in Christ in
[43:24] Christ Jesus the Bible said the Bible
[43:27] said that God empty you know what you do
[43:32] when you empty anything God empty into
[43:36] Christ Paul says for it was God in
[43:40] Christ reconciling the world
[43:42] amen just think God empty himself into
[43:47] Christ and Christ taught it not robbery
[43:51] to be equal with God for he was God I
[43:55] mean that's the thing they killed him
[44:01] for breaking the Sabbath day making
[44:06] himself God so just
[44:12] like I said the word equal with God
[44:15] sometimes troll the the explanation of
[44:21] that scripture that even though he was
[44:23] God he never wanted to be equal with God
[44:25] no he never taught it robbery if he says
[44:29] he was God he never thought he was doing
[44:33] anything out of Scripture or out of you
[44:36] know the plan of redemption when he said
[44:38] I and my father I want he never told he
[44:42] was out of the plan of God when he said
[44:44] if you have seen me you have seen the
[44:46] father he never taught a robbery praise
[44:52] the Lord
[44:53] you see and that is the position of the
[44:56] Sun shake even waved the the the story
[45:02] of the prodigal son he talked what the
[45:08] father had given him that's the gift of
[45:10] the father he took that inheritance he
[45:13] went down he wasted ain't you know but
[45:17] he never talked that he robbed his
[45:19] father all he thought was he that that
[45:24] is his father and his father give him
[45:27] what belongs to him
[45:28] he father give him a portion of the
[45:32] inheritance it was not like he felt like
[45:38] a robber yeah he had to go and submit
[45:42] himself over to told to the police or to
[45:45] the council of that day he says that's
[45:48] the thing they killed him for breaking
[45:50] the Sabbath making himself God and he
[45:54] was the lord of the Sabbath he was God
[45:57] in man with Christ God in Christ
[46:00] reconciling the world to himself now and
[46:04] everything that God was he empty in to
[46:08] Christ praise the Lord and and I mean
[46:13] that's that is the place that I was I
[46:17] was thinking about you know because I
[46:20] just think the other it's a beautiful
[46:23] weight I mean a very beautiful way Paul
[46:26] place their scripture over them in the
[46:30] book of Philippians you know Paul like
[46:35] brother branham said Paul was not among
[46:39] the twelve disciples we all know that
[46:41] you know he came in the book of Acts
[46:45] after his experience on the road of
[46:48] Damascus
[46:49] so you see Paul way that's that's a
[46:52] beautiful way he said it even in a book
[46:54] of Philippians Paul way of talking about
[46:57] Christ was net true the effli Ministry
[47:01] of Christ Paul way of talking about
[47:04] Christ you you will see their self
[47:06] there's a scripture year let me find
[47:09] there for you is it's also over in the
[47:12] book of Philippians Paul talking about
[47:14] Christ he never talks from his birth he
[47:17] talks from the resurrection of Jesus
[47:19] Christ you know he comes from the
[47:22] resurrection because it is after the
[47:25] resurrection is the resurrection of
[47:27] Jesus Christ that even make the breath
[47:29] of Jesus Christ most significant if he
[47:32] wouldn't have come out of the grave the
[47:35] the story of his birth was just going to
[47:38] be a myth it was going to be wash away
[47:40] praise the Lord Amen so this was God in
[47:46] Christ reconciling the world
[47:48] God was net I mean Christ was not
[47:51] thinking it that he was robbing God of
[47:53] anything that's the reason why he acts
[47:57] that whatsoever we can accent in his
[47:59] name you know we can go straight to the
[48:02] throne of grace and ask the father
[48:03] brother Branham also said this in the
[48:05] message to Exeter I want to take this as
[48:08] a second coat tonight he says we are in
[48:10] an accident and leaving and turning
[48:16] turning the tips off in a moment all my
[48:19] friends brothers both present and that
[48:21] we hear the tape as your brother a
[48:24] citizen of the kingdom of heaven come
[48:26] out this is an accident now the thing
[48:29] that caught my attention on this code is
[48:32] there in an accident for their accident
[48:35] according to the promise that God gave
[48:38] to Abraham
[48:39] he says I'm going to come down amen
[48:44] he says I'm going to come down and with
[48:46] a mighty hand I will bring them out
[48:50] praise the Lord
[48:52] so when he met Moses there in the
[48:54] burning bush he told Moses for I have
[48:57] heard the crying of my people and I'm
[49:00] coming down and I'm come down to deliver
[49:04] them so you see that the Ministry of
[49:09] Moses for Moses to get out there and
[49:11] call flies into assistant and call flees
[49:15] he never talked he was robbing God and
[49:20] again he was not playing God because
[49:25] that is word my inspiration is tonight
[49:27] playing God there is a difference of a
[49:30] man playing God and a man not taking a
[49:35] robbery to be equal with God because we
[49:39] are in a generation that is playing God
[49:41] I mean a generation that believed that
[49:47] they can define what is good and evil
[49:51] that's what the devil told Eve for God
[49:55] knows that if you do this you will be
[49:58] like God knowing good and evil in a
[50:01] sense saying defining good and evil
[50:05] good and evil is not defined by what we
[50:09] think or how we feel good and evil is
[50:11] defined by the Creator by the Word of
[50:14] God so there is a difference of playing
[50:19] God praise the Lord and and and that is
[50:24] where the the church is that is where
[50:29] the Christian faith is you know when we
[50:33] play church like a like you think about
[50:37] this in it in the 10 commandments what
[50:41] the Bible says do not take the name of
[50:45] the LORD thy God in vain most of the
[50:49] time we have
[50:52] taught from our Sunday school days is
[50:54] that I mean just don't call God name on
[50:56] anything I mean just don't say Jesus
[50:58] without a reason but taking the name of
[51:01] God in vain it's more than that because
[51:06] Paul says let every one that name the
[51:09] name of Christ depart from evil so
[51:14] taking the name of the Lord in vain is
[51:17] the way we are representing him as
[51:19] Christine if we are giving a poor
[51:21] represented representation of
[51:24] Christianity we are taking the name of
[51:26] the Lord in vain
[51:30] praise the Lord if we have the name of
[51:34] the Lord just like brother Branham says
[51:36] if the Egyptian knew they would have
[51:38] taken their stick from Moses it daniil
[51:43] he says that is just how the name of
[51:46] Jesus Christ is in the church and we
[51:51] have the name of Jesus Christ
[51:53] just like the stick the Moses heart that
[51:56] he could stretch the stake and open the
[51:58] Red Sea stretch the stake and call for
[52:01] flies and flee that is a scene where we
[52:04] can call on the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:06] Christ and and and affirm our prayers
[52:10] with that and God has promised to meet
[52:14] her at the very point of our needs so if
[52:17] we are having the name of Jesus Christ
[52:20] just like that stake was in the hands of
[52:23] Moses and then we don't know what to do
[52:26] with it and then we are complaining a
[52:28] meaning and we are doing everything that
[52:31] we are doing we are taking the name of
[52:33] the Lord in vain can you imagine that
[52:37] God gave Moses that Commission right
[52:42] from that experience work heat roll the
[52:45] the stick down it turned to a serpent he
[52:50] pick it up by the tail it turned back to
[52:52] his sake and and with all that he have
[52:55] experienced in the presence of God and
[52:58] he goes down there to the house of
[53:01] Pharaoh
[53:04] and don't even know what to do praise
[53:08] the Lord he goes down there in the house
[53:11] of Pharaoh and he drove his stick down
[53:14] and jeans and jam brews come and throw
[53:17] the stick down and Moses said oh wow I
[53:21] mean he's running away because he have
[53:23] seen an impersonation of what he have
[53:26] done it's almost like all the
[53:30] impersonation that turns to bring
[53:33] intimidation on the believer a son of
[53:36] God a daughter of God must know where
[53:38] they are standing with God because we
[53:44] are not taking on the name of a church
[53:46] we're not taking on the name of our
[53:49] messenger we are taking on the name of
[53:51] Jesus Christ because when when when
[53:55] after the marriage is done the marriage
[53:59] officer pronounced and husband a wife
[54:01] and a woman takes on the name of her
[54:03] husband praise the Lord
[54:10] there's a group of people that think you
[54:14] know they are thinking it's robbery to
[54:17] be called the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[54:20] it's robbery for us to think that we are
[54:27] the people that are going to experience
[54:28] the body change in the rapture so we
[54:31] have two groups here we have one group
[54:34] that is playing God defining good and
[54:41] evil and we have another group of people
[54:45] that is thinking it's not robbery I can
[54:49] ask God for big things because he's my
[54:53] father
[54:56] if I if I seen if I make me sick I can
[55:00] run to the throne of grace and repent
[55:03] like the prodigal son because he's my
[55:06] father now boy I never thought that he
[55:09] robbed his father he never taught a
[55:13] robbery he never taught that he robbed
[55:15] his father he was just disappointed in
[55:17] himself
[55:18] that he never did what he thought he was
[55:21] going to do and because he never taught
[55:27] a robbery that was the reason why he
[55:29] came back home and soft for mercy where
[55:38] Bentham said I mean Jesus said that ever
[55:41] comes to steal kill and to destroy is
[55:45] one that is not of the household that
[55:48] comes to rob a man that is of the
[55:50] household never robbed his parents it so
[55:56] maybe he want to take his his
[55:58] inheritance earlier than he should have
[56:00] it well after all you brought him into
[56:04] the world you are responsible for him or
[56:06] for her are we together and we trained
[56:11] him for them to be able to best
[56:14] represent the parent so I'm looking at
[56:18] this table said I'm telling Eve for God
[56:22] knows that it did you eat this think you
[56:28] can play God you can be able to define
[56:35] [Music]
[56:37] good and evil if it is not the
[56:42] generation that we are living in if it
[56:46] is not the time that we are living in
[56:48] and it's I mean it's so it's so it's so
[56:50] bad that even children of God and in
[56:56] people that's supposed to know the Word
[57:00] of God and and and and what has been
[57:02] given to us in this age instead of
[57:05] taking God's Word praise the Lord
[57:10] Manny this was Naren until I have said
[57:14] something I was talking to to an any
[57:16] video today and he said something that I
[57:20] thought was just so you know well so I
[57:25] told you my sis I mean what you are
[57:28] telling me how can you define that in
[57:30] the Word of God
[57:31] you know trying to counsel these people
[57:36] in some problem is what I think you know
[57:39] we need to have a separation as how how
[57:42] can you put separation in the marriage
[57:45] coveting working you do it this is well
[57:50] [Music]
[57:55] Abraham a lot when I couldn't understand
[57:59] one another D separated that's it
[58:01] brother a brain in love with my husband
[58:02] and wife and that is the attitude of
[58:14] playing God when a man and a woman will
[58:19] net Homer themself to the Word of God
[58:21] and they are just caught up in their
[58:24] minds and think they are what they are
[58:27] thinking in your mind is God is God's
[58:29] because they are thinking about it so
[58:31] it's right it is it the generation I say
[58:35] follow your mind or follow your heart
[58:39] that is playing God you are not taking
[58:43] God's words you are not living according
[58:45] to God's Word you are just following
[58:47] your heart when your heart is
[58:49] desperately wicked and you can even
[58:51] define it that's the issue we are in
[58:59] where as I said a call good for evil and
[59:03] evil for good what actually they are
[59:06] trying to do they are trying to define
[59:08] what is right they are trying to define
[59:12] what is truth if it is not in the Pope
[59:15] the popular media is not truth that is
[59:21] playing God trying to force on us a
[59:28] generation to tell us that well you know
[59:31] this whole gender thing you are playing
[59:34] God and when the devil God Eve to play
[59:39] God he robbed her of that golly
[59:45] to be that the thing of her being and a
[59:48] daughter of God because she was me right
[59:51] from the hands of God just like Adam was
[59:53] there were me in the image of God there
[59:55] were gods so you see the devil comes he
[1:00:00] rubbed us from our truth image and he
[1:00:05] gave us a wrong image for us to be
[1:00:08] playing Church taking the name of the
[1:00:12] Lord in vain saying we are believe in
[1:00:16] the world we are going in the rapture
[1:00:17] and I even living up to it that's the
[1:00:25] generation that we are in a generation
[1:00:28] that is trying to that's what we are
[1:00:31] having all of these voices that is
[1:00:33] streaming out all of the voices that are
[1:00:38] streaming out the YouTube movement and
[1:00:40] all of these voices black by matter all
[1:00:42] of these things they want to play God
[1:00:47] praise the Lord I was just looking at
[1:00:54] something the other day a group of young
[1:00:59] people went into a church and caused a
[1:01:08] riot and says the church is not doing
[1:01:10] nothing for the community so that is the
[1:01:15] way that they have to make this church
[1:01:17] hold this church accountable to do
[1:01:20] something for the community as myself I
[1:01:23] said how many of them I just taught
[1:01:25] about our little assembling we drive 30
[1:01:29] minutes 20 minutes and everybody drives
[1:01:31] to come to church and the people right
[1:01:33] around them they see people driving in
[1:01:36] that place week in and week out
[1:01:41] praise the Lord
[1:01:44] that's the generation that we are living
[1:01:47] in a generation
[1:01:50] I want to play God they think there they
[1:01:56] are the definer of what the society is
[1:01:59] going to be praise the Lord
[1:02:05] and we have these are the believers on
[1:02:09] this side that is so scared so scared to
[1:02:12] take God at His Word thinking that if
[1:02:15] they do it is I mean they're going to be
[1:02:18] robbing God of anything praise the Lord
[1:02:23] what is the danger of trusting that God
[1:02:25] is going to do it what is the danger of
[1:02:31] looking taking God at His Word and
[1:02:35] believing that the same God that made
[1:02:38] the Sun - hangs in the heaven the god I
[1:02:41] said let there be and there was Lord if
[1:02:44] that's your word I'm hauling to this
[1:02:46] world when people compromise to be able
[1:02:54] to bring their desire to pass you are
[1:02:57] playing God you are playing God because
[1:03:04] you can wait on God provision so you
[1:03:07] have to make your own way to be able to
[1:03:10] provide your needs by breaking God's
[1:03:13] Word that's how can we have end up with
[1:03:19] a God of this evil age that's how Satan
[1:03:24] has been set on the throne of this age
[1:03:28] as the god of this evil age because he
[1:03:31] had a bunch of people you know his
[1:03:35] attributes that are playing out because
[1:03:37] that's why he want to do he just wanted
[1:03:39] to play God I was my throne above the
[1:03:42] stars of God and I will be like God it
[1:03:47] just playing God
[1:03:55] defining what is right and what is wrong
[1:03:58] what is truth and what is lie the age is
[1:04:06] caught right in there but there is a
[1:04:09] group of people there is a group of
[1:04:13] people there is a little branch there is
[1:04:17] a remnant of people that will not think
[1:04:21] it robbery there will not think it
[1:04:26] robbery I mean a son that would think in
[1:04:29] his mind to rob his father I mean he has
[1:04:32] been corrupted he he has taken on an
[1:04:34] evil heart fine a son must be able to go
[1:04:39] to the Father and if he asks the father
[1:04:46] his father don't give him what he asked
[1:04:48] for for that time it's all because the
[1:04:50] father is not trusting him that he has
[1:04:52] grown to that level to be able to handle
[1:04:54] it and that's how Almighty God deals
[1:04:57] with us we misrepresent the name of
[1:05:05] Christ we create stomach blood before
[1:05:08] people you are taking the name of the
[1:05:10] Lord in vain because when everybody
[1:05:13] knows you are a believer in everybody
[1:05:15] knows you are a Christian you it is it
[1:05:18] is not you I mean we we try to think
[1:05:20] that we are the one you know that they
[1:05:23] are persecuting when when Jesus made
[1:05:26] poured on the road of damasco war he
[1:05:28] said what are you persecuting me Paul
[1:05:31] never met him in the flesh but those
[1:05:34] Christians were bearing the name of
[1:05:35] Christ so it was the name of Christ that
[1:05:41] he was coming against and that is the
[1:05:43] same thing that you and myself are
[1:05:45] bearing we are bearing the name of
[1:05:47] Christ that we have to think about that
[1:05:49] it is not our individual live in our
[1:05:53] individual choice and any things that we
[1:05:55] want to do that's what we are in an
[1:05:59] ambassador is there is a kid 'm that you
[1:06:03] are representing
[1:06:10] and you know the embossing even though
[1:06:16] they are away from home but behave just
[1:06:20] like when you get there it's just like
[1:06:24] you are home they try to get I mean they
[1:06:28] try to put things around so any when you
[1:06:30] enter the Empire you feel like you are
[1:06:32] home I got a little bit scary when I was
[1:06:46] reading that thing and I see believers
[1:06:51] you know assuming that you know Jesus
[1:06:56] even though he was gone but he humbled
[1:06:59] himself he never wanted for them to know
[1:07:01] that he was gone I don't think that's
[1:07:04] what the Apostle Paul was saying he was
[1:07:08] trying to encourage us to get in the
[1:07:10] same mind the see mind that if we go to
[1:07:16] God in prayer as a son of God as a
[1:07:19] daughter of God having the mind and
[1:07:23] thinking it not robbery it gives us the
[1:07:27] right to be able to boil it ask the
[1:07:29] Father because we know we are not
[1:07:35] robbing God of anything
[1:07:43] when he gave us the Holy Ghost he does
[1:07:45] not rob us of anything that is our
[1:07:47] original nature that's the place we were
[1:07:49] supposed to be and that's what people
[1:07:52] are afraid of the new birth because the
[1:07:58] thing their world is going to make them
[1:07:59] order is going to make them different
[1:08:01] they still want to hold on to this
[1:08:05] sinful nature and sinful life Newberg
[1:08:10] does not take our sinful nature
[1:08:12] automatically but it gives us grace to
[1:08:14] be able to face that devil in the face
[1:08:16] and since there's a new men are living
[1:08:19] in this house so that just the two
[1:08:25] thoughts I wanted to bring to us tonight
[1:08:26] a generation that is playing God and
[1:08:32] think they are the one that can be able
[1:08:35] to define what this nation will be and
[1:08:41] all of the things they are doing out
[1:08:43] there throwing their monuments and all
[1:08:45] of that that I mean is if they are
[1:08:47] thinking that by doing that they would
[1:08:49] define what I mean what actually it is
[1:08:52] they will be able to make a statement
[1:08:56] that's the devil's gospel that was what
[1:09:01] he preached to our parents when we are
[1:09:08] confronted with the truth of God's Word
[1:09:10] and we think that we have a better way
[1:09:13] to do it
[1:09:14] leaving that word you are playing God
[1:09:17] taking the position of the world you are
[1:09:20] not thinking a robbery that God I can
[1:09:23] take your word just like you know the
[1:09:26] angel told John take the book and eat it
[1:09:29] the very same book that no man was water
[1:09:32] to look upon Norman was wanted to touch
[1:09:35] no man was wanted to read John was told
[1:09:42] to take the book and eat it because true
[1:09:48] Redemption Christ has brought us to his
[1:09:51] worthiness he has brought us to the same
[1:09:58] place where he is where I am there you
[1:10:03] will be also that's what he said before
[1:10:06] we get there physically spiritually he
[1:10:08] has brought us to that place thinking it
[1:10:15] not robbery to be equal with God brother
[1:10:19] Branham says I get back on that a exeter
[1:10:21] coat again we are in an exodus and
[1:10:28] leaving and turning the tape off for the
[1:10:31] moment all my brother my brothers both
[1:10:34] pressing and i will hear the tape as
[1:10:37] your brother a citizen of the kingdom of
[1:10:40] heaven come out this is an accident for
[1:10:45] all that's left behind will bear the Mac
[1:10:49] of the beasts come out of Babylon come
[1:10:53] out of confusion come out of this system
[1:10:55] and self the Living God
[1:10:59] this great danger of the coveting that
[1:11:03] was traveling with Israel in the form of
[1:11:08] the pillar of fire by night the pillar
[1:11:14] of cloud by day they had angel of the
[1:11:17] covenant he says Jesus Christ in the
[1:11:21] form of God thought it not robbery but
[1:11:26] become equal with God now he's a pillar
[1:11:32] of fire in the same form that he was
[1:11:36] back there breaking the first exit of
[1:11:39] breaking the second accident and year he
[1:11:43] is waved at a exeter now what I'm trying
[1:11:48] why I read this quote is as we are in
[1:11:52] this Exeter we see darkness all around
[1:11:56] us the promise that God gave to Abraham
[1:11:59] was that he will come down
[1:12:02] and with a mighty him he will bring them
[1:12:07] out and in the second Exeter he came
[1:12:12] down again that's why I crashed ought it
[1:12:17] not robbery to be equal with God and in
[1:12:20] this day Exeter that same angel of the
[1:12:23] Covenant has come down so we have the
[1:12:29] privilege to be able to deal with God
[1:12:32] directly it is not a lower form of God
[1:12:40] that is in our mess it's the same God
[1:12:44] they seem yesterday today and forever
[1:12:51] that is the reason why we came boiling
[1:12:54] go to the throne of grace we can boil it
[1:12:59] ask the father all that god help us to
[1:13:07] come to the place and know that when we
[1:13:10] live for our voice we are talking to the
[1:13:12] creator of heaven and earth we're not
[1:13:14] talking to someone that would take our
[1:13:16] prayers to the throne of grace nothing
[1:13:24] in the robbery to be equal with God
[1:13:28] because when we get to that place we
[1:13:34] will fall victim of this generation that
[1:13:36] is playing God and failure to take God
[1:13:42] by His Word and staying on his promises
[1:13:48] living the life of a make believer and I
[1:13:51] mean in compromising on the promises of
[1:13:54] God and not being able to trust God not
[1:13:57] being able to trust God Berta Branham
[1:14:00] says the greatest thing that is
[1:14:02] hammering the Church of the Living God
[1:14:04] hammering the people of God is fear not
[1:14:08] being able to trust God to know that he
[1:14:13] promised that I will be with you
[1:14:16] even in you to the end of the age Moses
[1:14:28] never taught it robbery when Jesus says
[1:14:33] said unto this mountain be thou removed
[1:14:37] for you to do that you also think in
[1:14:43] that robbery to be equal with God for
[1:14:47] you to be able to speak to your
[1:14:49] situation
[1:14:50] take a burden to God in prayer and say
[1:14:53] Lord I need you to deal with this the
[1:15:01] enemy will come and blast our mind with
[1:15:03] all of our our past life and all of the
[1:15:06] wrongs that we have done why because he
[1:15:09] want us to just play play God instead of
[1:15:14] being sons and daughters of God he want
[1:15:22] us to find other means to be able to
[1:15:25] define what is good for us beside the
[1:15:29] Word of God you know that's the reason
[1:15:33] why brother Branham says when we are
[1:15:35] fussing with one another the devil does
[1:15:37] not have a work to do because he knows
[1:15:39] these guys are just playing church but
[1:15:43] when a man or a woman a young brother
[1:15:46] sisters standing on the Word of God
[1:15:55] and thinking and now robbery to be equal
[1:15:58] with God I'm a son of God I'm a daughter
[1:16:02] of God I have a right to the father's
[1:16:05] inheritance let's bow our heads tonight
[1:16:45] we have to believe that we've been told
[1:16:52] that the enemy
[1:16:55] the devil will rather push us across the
[1:16:59] promised put it to the future or hold us
[1:17:05] back and say it's not for us
[1:17:27] in the age and the time and everything
[1:17:30] that is happening around us just like it
[1:17:34] was in the first Exeter gone came down
[1:17:37] and he was Vale in the prophet Moses and
[1:17:44] because the people the knew of his birth
[1:17:50] they knew what he did all of those
[1:17:54] things clouded their minds
[1:18:01] and it got to the place and said what do
[1:18:03] you think about yourself Moses you think
[1:18:06] too much about yourself Moses was not
[1:18:10] playing God it was God that has raised
[1:18:15] him to that position
[1:18:21] as a son of God as a daughter of God he
[1:18:25] want to bring us to that place where
[1:18:29] when we speak now boastfully not proud
[1:18:32] nor we speak Naurang that he promised he
[1:18:38] would never leave us he would never
[1:18:39] forsake us
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:44] we know our father is in control of
[1:18:47] everything he rules the universe
[1:19:02] I mean if uh if a son of God a daughter
[1:19:06] of God a brother or sister trying to
[1:19:09] speak of the word of God and hovering
[1:19:12] guilt in their hearts like the scripture
[1:19:16] said if our heart condemn us net we have
[1:19:18] confidence we can speak in the name of
[1:19:22] God we can stand for the word of God
[1:19:25] Claude can be able to use our lives he
[1:19:30] can be able to use our humble Christian
[1:19:33] life to be a witness but when we are
[1:19:39] allowing things in our lives trying to
[1:19:44] play God and and define
[1:19:50] what we think is good and what would
[1:19:53] thing is evil we even fight against the
[1:19:56] Word of God we fight against the Word of
[1:19:59] God that small stare voice is speaking
[1:20:04] to our heart but we just get so stuck in
[1:20:08] our stubbornness
[1:20:13] because sit on the same you can be gone
[1:20:16] you can play God every man that have
[1:20:22] ever tried to play God throughout the
[1:20:25] ages when the Pharaoh taught that he
[1:20:29] high everything on a control and he had
[1:20:31] the Hebrews honor his grape and he was
[1:20:35] playing God determining when they should
[1:20:37] go to bed and when did she rise up and
[1:20:39] when did she eat
[1:20:46] when God raised up a son he raised up a
[1:20:50] standard in Egypt Pharaoh confess and he
[1:20:58] knew there was an Almighty God
[1:21:05] this generation that is playing God and
[1:21:08] thinking that they can be able to
[1:21:10] determine would as a man and would it's
[1:21:12] a male and what marriage supposed to be
[1:21:15] in and and everything that they have out
[1:21:17] there
[1:21:19] oh there is a little ribbing of people
[1:21:23] there's a little bride as a little son
[1:21:26] and daughter of God that is taking
[1:21:29] instruction from God's Word we are not
[1:21:34] taking instruction from today's media
[1:21:37] and social media we are taking our
[1:21:41] instruction from God's Word
[1:21:46] we're not playing God neither are we
[1:21:52] thinking it robbery to be sons and
[1:21:55] daughters of God that's what we are
[1:21:57] that's what he have caught us tow that's
[1:22:00] why he has given us his spirit for us to
[1:22:04] represent him for us to live out like a
[1:22:08] son and daughter of God when no one is
[1:22:11] around and no one is watching be a son
[1:22:14] of God be a daughter of God if not you
[1:22:19] will be playing God
