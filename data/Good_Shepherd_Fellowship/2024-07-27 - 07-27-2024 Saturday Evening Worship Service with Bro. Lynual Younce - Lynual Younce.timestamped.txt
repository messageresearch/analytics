[29:47] or from work we greet you all in the
[29:49] name of the Lord Jesus amen praise the
[29:53] lord we uh uh
[29:58] thought that it would have been a
[30:00] blessing for us to to put this time
[30:03] aside and and and just come and and
[30:05] Worship the Lord
[30:08] together this is
[30:11] uh uh I was just speaking with one of
[30:13] the brothers from South Africa this
[30:16] afternoon and uh he was reminding me
[30:19] this is about 20
[30:21] years since I've been exposed to our
[30:24] dear brother music I remember I was back
[30:26] in South Africa in I was in in4 and uh I
[30:30] was traveling with a brother from
[30:32] Johannesburg to the Namibia border
[30:36] that's about 6 to 8 hours
[30:38] drive and
[30:40] uh and he was playing uh uh a music that
[30:44] I could connect with I was just uh
[30:47] hearing uh the voice of the prophet and
[30:49] you know hearing some words and that so
[30:52] I asked him who wrote this music you
[30:54] know and since that time uh uh I've been
[30:58] uh listening to brother Young's music
[31:02] and uh uh to many of us is it's not new
[31:06] we are familiar with faith but tonight
[31:08] we just wanted to come and worship
[31:10] together praise the Lord now uh uh this
[31:13] scripture we read
[31:15] tonight uh we are all familiar with it
[31:18] brother Brandon read the scripture
[31:21] preaching the message this day this
[31:23] scripture is
[31:25] fulfilled and uh uh the reason why I
[31:28] read it
[31:29] tonight because uh I was thinking about
[31:35] U where the prophet Isaiah mentioned
[31:38] that he's going to give us a Garment of
[31:40] Praise for the spirit of
[31:43] heaviness and we realized that uh
[31:48] uh when brother
[31:51] Brandon uh preached this
[31:56] message he show in the scripture how
[32:01] Jesus read this at the beginning of his
[32:04] ministry and he closed the book in the
[32:08] middle of uh verse two when he read to
[32:12] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[32:14] he closed the book and he hand it back
[32:17] to the
[32:18] priest and what the prophet was trying
[32:20] to show us is there there was another
[32:23] portion of the of this scripture that
[32:25] needed to be fulfilled
[32:28] there was an alpha part that was
[32:29] fulfilled there was a part for the
[32:31] bridegroom that was fulfilled and there
[32:34] is a part for the bride that needed to
[32:36] be fulfilled so Jesus never read the
[32:39] second portion of that scripture which
[32:41] is the day of Virgin which of course we
[32:44] know that we are all living in the day
[32:45] of
[32:46] Vengeance but uh so when brother Bram
[32:50] preached the message birth pain and
[32:52] after the experience we all know the
[32:54] story about it how God set the stage for
[32:57] that message to be
[32:59] preached and he reminded us there was a
[33:01] second part of the the verse to be
[33:03] fulfilled or the second part of that
[33:06] scripture and under the day of
[33:10] virgins which is the day of
[33:12] judgment God has promised his
[33:16] bride a special gift while the word is
[33:20] going on the
[33:22] [Music]
[33:24] Judgment verse three of that particular
[33:27] prophecy which of course verse three is
[33:29] the continuation of verse two verse two
[33:33] says to appoint unto them that moon in
[33:37] Zion and Zion we've been taught is a
[33:40] type of the
[33:42] Bride so we that are in Zion Zion is a
[33:46] chosen City that's how she's a top of
[33:49] the
[33:51] Bride he promised to give unto us Beauty
[33:57] for
[33:59] es praise the Lord he also promised to
[34:04] give unto us the O of
[34:08] joy for
[34:11] mour he promised to give unto us a
[34:15] Garment of
[34:16] Praise for the spirit of
[34:20] heaviness and in the message uh uh
[34:22] letting off the pressure brother
[34:23] brandham said the lead is taken out of
[34:25] hell demon Spirits are all stram into
[34:28] the Earth that's what is causing
[34:30] pressure but yet God is promising to
[34:32] give us a Garment of
[34:34] Praise for the spirit of heaviness
[34:38] praise the Lord that's what the message
[34:40] of the hour brought to
[34:42] us amen this message has come to give us
[34:45] Beauty for arches it have come to give
[34:48] us h h a oil of joy for M and A Garment
[34:54] of Praise for the spirit of heaviness

[34:59] want us to do tonight I want us to wear

[44:06] brandom now what you should say have you
[44:09] heard of My Savior Jesus Christ Let

[44:14] it so uh the uh sincerity of our hearts
[44:19] is being recorded right now from
[44:22] heaven and
[44:24] God it's just it's a Ministry
[44:28] singing The Prophet said is a
[44:31] Ministry and
[44:33] uh when I was uh 23 year old I was
[44:37] offered a country
[44:39] contract and I was offered a job going
[44:42] in the tent Ministry $50 a
[44:45] week so here was a country contract and
[44:49] traveling and playing a guitar singing
[44:51] sit in the tent guess what I
[44:54] did I turned down the country contract
[44:58] for $50 a
[44:59] week and the devil strowed it in my face
[45:02] all my
[45:03] life I'll get broke sometime and have a
[45:06] rough time said see you wouldn't be like
[45:10] this if You' had done but you know what
[45:13] I wouldn't trade what I feel right
[45:15] now for nothing else there that they
[45:19] have to
[45:21] offer and to know
[45:24] that when he spoke to me
[45:28] I asked him what he wanted me to
[45:32] do he said I want you to
[45:35] sing the brightest
[45:37] song I had just come into the message

[2:06:23] it it's a waiting
[2:06:26] song I remember first time I saw her she
[2:06:31] got the most beautiful blue eyes you've
[2:06:33] ever
[2:06:34] seen and I was working in a temporary
[2:06:38] job but in the newspaper office and her
[2:06:41] daddy was
[2:06:42] a one of the big dudes there so she
[2:06:45] walked in one day walked by my office
[2:06:47] and I looked up at her and I said I
[2:06:49] think I love you
[2:06:56] so
[2:06:58] um there's nothing special as a a
[2:07:01] sweetheart she's not just my wife she's
[2:07:05] my sweetheart
[2:07:06] and
[2:07:08] uh I know I
[2:07:11] don't I worship a ground she walks on
[2:07:14] she's
[2:07:16] a she's everything
[2:07:19] that I've ever said a
[2:07:23] you want me to shut up
[2:07:29] Lord but she knows I love
[2:07:35] her I've spent
[2:07:37] many week and months away from
[2:07:41] her I look back on our marriage
[2:07:44] and think at the times
[2:07:47] of somewhere in Africa or I've been in 4
[2:07:51] five foreign
[2:07:53] countries and uh God has allowed me to
[2:07:57] meet some most special people on the
[2:07:59] planet the Bride of Jesus Christ no
[2:08:03] matter what color she is how tall she is
[2:08:06] how short she is how rich or how poor
[2:08:09] she is she's his and that makes her
[2:08:12] special that makes her the queen thank
[2:08:15] you that makes her absolutely the
[2:08:17] queenall she's a she is so wonderful and
[2:08:22] uh and to sit it like this and and to
[2:08:25] look into your eyes and and know that
[2:08:27] he'd call me to talk to you and sing to
[2:08:30] you and uh I count that one of the
[2:08:35] most a privilege
[2:08:37] that I couldn't have found out where I
[2:08:40] was I would have I know I would have
[2:08:43] went down that road and at that time I
[2:08:45] would
[2:08:46] have it's hard telling what would have
[2:08:49] happened
[2:08:52] but today I'd be an old drunk singing
[2:08:56] Your Cheating
[2:08:58] Heart but something in me would still be
[2:09:01] crying out I couldn't get away from it I
[2:09:03] don't care what I done I'd never Escape
[2:09:05] what this is right now this is so
[2:09:08] precious to sit in this
[2:09:11] atmosphere you can't see him but if he
[2:09:14] would open your spiritual eyes we're
[2:09:16] encamped about by a great cloud of
[2:09:18] witnesses here tonight with uh
[2:09:22] the angels of God are here the anointing
[2:09:25] of the Holy Ghost is just sitting here
[2:09:29] he just reaching for you and he he and
[2:09:32] he sees everything you need and
[2:09:33] everything you want and he wants so much
[2:09:36] you just to open up your heart and let
[2:09:38] him touch you tonight this is not just a
[2:09:42] gathering or or
[2:09:45] entertainment this is
[2:09:47] Jesus on the scene it's just him here I
[2:09:51] know when brother Brandon was here how
[2:09:55] he would bring Jesus on the scene he was
[2:09:57] not Jesus but he would bring him on the
[2:10:00] scene and he gave us the
[2:10:02] same commission yes he gave us the same
[2:10:06] commission to break him and uh I feel
[2:10:10] him right now such in such a manner that

[2:10:16] somewhere but uh there two things I
[2:10:20] can't do I he probably heard me say that
[2:10:24] but I can't sing and cry at the same
