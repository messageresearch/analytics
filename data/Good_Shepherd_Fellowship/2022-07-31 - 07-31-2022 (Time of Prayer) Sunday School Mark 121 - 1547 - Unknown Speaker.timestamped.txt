[0:00] [Music]
[1:44] and he began to speak unto them by
[1:46] parables
[1:48] a certain man planted a vineyard and set
[1:50] an hedge about it and digged a place for
[1:53] the wine fat and built a tower
[1:55] and let it out to husbandman and went
[1:57] into a far country
[1:59] and at the season he sent to the
[2:01] husbandman a servant that he might
[2:02] receive from the husbandman of the fruit
[2:04] of the vineyard
[2:05] and they caught him and beat him and
[2:07] sent him away empty
[2:09] and again he sent them to them another
[2:10] servant and at him they cast stones and
[2:13] wounded him in their head and sent him
[2:15] away shamefully handled
[2:18] and again
[2:19] he sent another
[2:21] and him they killed and many others
[2:23] beating some and killing some
[2:26] having yet therefore one son his well
[2:28] beloved
[2:30] he sent him also last unto them saying
[2:32] they will reverence my son
[2:35] but those husbandmen said among
[2:36] themselves this is the air come let us
[2:39] kill him and the inheritance shall be
[2:41] ours
[2:42] and they took him and killed him and
[2:44] cast him out of the vineyard
[2:47] what shall therefore the lord of the
[2:49] vineyard do
[2:51] he will come and destroy the husbandmen
[2:53] and will give the vineyard unto others
[2:56] and have ye not read this scripture
[2:58] the stone which the builders rejected
[3:00] has become the head of the
[3:02] corner this was the lord's doing
[3:06] and it is marvelous in our eyes
[3:09] and they sought to lay hold on him but
[3:11] feared the people
[3:12] for they knew that he had spoken the
[3:14] parable against them
[3:15] and they left him and went their way
[3:18] and they send unto him certain of the
[3:20] pharisees and of the herodians to catch
[3:22] him in his words
[3:24] and when they will come they say unto
[3:25] him master
[3:27] we know that thou art true and carest
[3:30] for no man for thou regardless not the
[3:32] person of men but teach us the way of
[3:34] god in truth
[3:36] is it lawful to give tribute to caesar
[3:38] or not
[3:40] shall we give or shall we not give
[3:43] but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto
[3:45] them
[3:46] why tempt ye me
[3:49] bring me a penny that i may see it
[3:51] and they brought it
[3:53] and he saith unto them
[3:54] whose is this image and superscription
[3:57] and they said unto him caesar's and
[4:00] jesus answering said unto them
[4:02] render to caesar the things that are
[4:04] caesar's and to god the things that are
[4:06] god's
[4:07] and they marveled at him
[4:09] then come unto him the sadducees which
[4:11] say there is no resurrection and they
[4:13] asked him saying master moses wrote unto
[4:16] us if a man's brother die and leave his
[4:19] wife behind him and leave no children
[4:21] that his brother should take his wife
[4:23] and raise up seed unto his brother
[4:26] now there were seven brethren
[4:28] and the first took a wife and dying left
[4:31] no seed
[4:32] and the second took her and died neither
[4:34] left he any seed and the third likewise
[4:38] and the seven had her and left no seed
[4:41] last of all the woman died also
[4:45] in the resurrection therefore when they
[4:47] shall rise
[4:49] whose wife shall she be of them for the
[4:51] seven had her to wife
[4:53] and jesus answering said unto them do ye
[4:56] not therefore er
[4:58] because ye know not the scriptures
[4:59] neither the power of god
[5:02] for when they shall rise from the dead
[5:04] they neither marry nor are given in
[5:05] marriage but are as the angels which are
[5:07] in heaven and as touching the dead
[5:10] they that rise
[5:12] have ye not read in the book of moses
[5:14] how in the bush god spake unto him
[5:16] saying i am the god of abraham and the
[5:19] god of isaac and the god of jacob
[5:22] he is not the god of the dead
[5:24] but the god of the living he therefore
[5:27] do greatly er
[5:29] and one of the scribes came and having
[5:31] heard them reasoning together and
[5:32] perceiving that he had answered them
[5:33] well asked him
[5:35] which is the first commandment of all
[5:38] and jesus answered him
[5:40] the first of all the commandments is
[5:43] hear o israel
[5:45] the lord our god
[5:47] is one lord
[5:49] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[5:51] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[5:53] and with all thy mind and with all thy
[5:55] strength
[5:57] this is the first commandment
[6:00] and the second is like
[6:02] namely this
[6:04] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[6:07] there is none other commandment greater
[6:09] than these
[6:11] and the scribe said unto him
[6:13] well master thou hast said the truth for
[6:15] there is one god and there is none other
[6:17] but he and to love him with all the
[6:19] heart and with all the understanding and
[6:20] with all the soul and with all the
[6:22] strength
[6:23] and to love his neighbor as himself
[6:26] is more than all whole burnt offerings
[6:28] and sacrifices
[6:30] and when jesus saw that he answered
[6:31] discreetly he said unto him thou art not
[6:34] far from the kingdom of god
[6:37] and no man after that just ask him any
[6:39] question
[6:41] and jesus answered and said
[6:43] while he taught in the temple
[6:45] how say the scribes that christ is the
[6:47] son of david
[6:49] for david himself said by the holy ghost
[6:52] the lord said to my lord sit thou on my
[6:55] right hand till i make thine enemies thy
[6:57] footstool
[6:59] david therefore himself calleth him lord
[7:02] and whence is he then his son
[7:05] and the common people heard him gladly
[7:08] and he said unto them in his doctrine
[7:10] beware of the scribes which love to go
[7:13] in long clothing and love salutations in
[7:16] the marketplaces and the chief seats in
[7:18] the synagogues and the uppermost rooms
[7:20] at feasts
[7:21] which devour widows houses
[7:24] and for a pretence make long prayers
[7:28] these shall receive greater damnation
[7:31] and jesus sat over against the treasury
[7:33] and beheld how the people cast money
[7:35] into the treasury and many that were
[7:37] rich cast in much
[7:39] and there came a certain poor widow and
[7:41] she threw in two mites which make a
[7:43] fathing
[7:45] and he called unto him his disciples and
[7:47] saith unto them verily i say unto you
[7:49] that this poor widow have cast more in
[7:52] than all they which have cast into the
[7:54] treasury
[7:55] for all they did cast in of their
[7:57] abundance
[7:58] but she of her want did cast in all that
[8:01] she had
[8:02] even all her living
[8:13] and as he went out of the temple one of
[8:15] his disciples saith unto him master see
[8:17] what manner of stones and what buildings
[8:20] are here
[8:21] and jesus answering said unto him see a
[8:23] star these great buildings there shall
[8:26] not be left one stone upon another that
[8:28] shall not be thrown down
[8:31] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[8:33] over against the temple peter and james
[8:35] and john and andrew asked him privately
[8:38] tell us when shall these things be
[8:41] and what shall be the sign when all
[8:43] these things shall be fulfilled
[8:46] and jesus answering them began to say
[8:49] take heed lest any man deceive you
[8:52] for many shall come in my name saying i
[8:54] am christ and shall deceive many
[8:57] and when you shall hear of wars and
[8:59] rumors of wars
[9:01] be ye not troubled
[9:03] for such things must needs be
[9:05] but the end shall not be yet
[9:08] for nation shall rise against nation and
[9:10] kingdom against kingdom and there shall
[9:12] be earthquakes in diverse places and
[9:14] there shall be famines and troubles
[9:17] these are the beginnings of sorrows
[9:20] but take heed to yourselves
[9:23] for they shall deliver you up to
[9:24] councils and in the synagogues ye shall
[9:27] be beaten and you shall be brought
[9:28] before rulers and kings for my sake for
[9:30] a testimony against them
[9:33] and the gospel must first be published
[9:35] among all nations
[9:37] but when they shall lead you and deliver
[9:39] you up take no thought beforehand what
[9:41] ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate
[9:44] but whatsoever shall be given you in
[9:45] that hour that speak ye
[9:47] but it is not ye that speak but the holy
[9:50] ghost
[9:52] now the brother shall betray the brother
[9:53] to death
[9:54] and the father the son
[9:56] and children shall rise up against their
[9:58] parents and shall cause them to be put
[10:00] to death
[10:02] and ye shall be hated of all men for my
[10:04] name's sake
[10:06] but he that you'll endure unto the end
[10:08] the same shall be saved
[10:11] but when ye shall see the abomination of
[10:13] desolation spoken of by daniel the
[10:15] prophet standing where it ought not
[10:18] let him that readeth understand
[10:21] then let them that be in judea flee to
[10:23] the mountains
[10:24] and let him that is on the housetop not
[10:26] go down into the house neither enter
[10:29] therein to take anything out of his
[10:31] house and let him that is in the field
[10:33] not turn back again for to take up his
[10:35] garment
[10:37] but woe to them that are with child and
[10:39] to them that give suck in those days
[10:42] and pray ye that your flight be not in
[10:45] the winter
[10:46] for in those days
[10:48] shall be affliction such as was not from
[10:50] the beginning of the creation which god
[10:52] created unto this time neither shall be
[10:55] and except that the lord had shortened
[10:57] those days no flesh should be saved
[11:00] but for the elect's sake whom he hath
[11:03] chosen he hath shortened the days
[11:06] and then if any man shall say to you lo
[11:08] here is christ or lo he is there
[11:12] believe him not for false christs and
[11:15] false prophets shall rise and shall show
[11:18] signs and wonders to seduce if it were
[11:20] possible even the elect
[11:23] but take ye heed
[11:25] behold i have foretold you all things
[11:29] but in those days
[11:31] after that tribulation
[11:33] the sun shall be darkened and the moon
[11:35] shall not give her light
[11:37] and the stars of heaven shall fall and
[11:39] the powers that are in heaven shall be
[11:41] shaken
[11:43] and then shall they see the son of man
[11:45] coming in the clouds with great power
[11:47] and glory
[11:48] and then shall he send his angels and
[11:51] shall gather together his elect from the
[11:52] four winds from the uttermost part of
[11:54] the earth to the uttermost part of
[11:56] heaven
[11:59] now learn a parable of the fig tree
[12:02] when her branch is yet tender and
[12:03] putteth forth leaves ye know that summer
[12:06] is near
[12:08] so ye in like manner when you shall see
[12:10] these things come to pass know that it
[12:12] is nigh even at the doors
[12:15] verily i say unto you that this
[12:17] generation shall not pass till all these
[12:19] things be done
[12:21] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[12:23] words shall not pass away
[12:26] but of that day and that hour knoweth no
[12:29] man
[12:30] no not the angels which are in heaven
[12:32] neither the son
[12:34] but the father
[12:36] take ye heed
[12:38] watch and pray
[12:40] for ye know not when the time is
[12:44] for the son of man
[12:45] is as a man taking a far journey who
[12:47] left his house and gave authority to his
[12:50] servants and to every man his work and
[12:51] commanded the porter to watch
[12:54] watch ye therefore
[12:57] for ye know not when the master of the
[12:58] house cometh at even or at midnight or
[13:01] at the crowing or in the morning
[13:04] lest coming suddenly
[13:06] he find you sleeping
[13:09] and what i say unto you
[13:11] i say unto all
[13:14] watch
[13:16] after two days was the feast of the
[13:18] passover and of unleavened bread
[13:20] and the chief priests and the scribes
[13:22] sought how they might take him by craft
[13:24] and put him to death
[13:25] but they said not on the feast day lest
[13:28] there be an uproar of the people
[13:31] and being in bethany in the house of
[13:33] simon the leper as he sat at meat there
[13:35] came a woman having an alabaster box of
[13:37] ointment of spikenard very precious
[13:40] and she break the box and poured it on
[13:42] his head
[13:43] and there were some that had indignation
[13:44] within themselves and said why was this
[13:46] waste of the ointment made
[13:48] for it might have been sold for more
[13:50] than 300 pence and have been given to
[13:52] the poor
[13:53] and they murmured against her and jesus
[13:56] said
[13:57] let her alone
[13:58] why trouble ye her
[14:00] she hath brought a good work on me
[14:03] for ye have the poor with you always and
[14:05] whensoever ye will you may do them good
[14:07] but me ye have not always
[14:10] she has done what she could
[14:12] she has come beforehand to anoint my
[14:14] body to the burying
[14:16] verily i say unto you wheresoever this
[14:18] gospel shall be preached throughout the
[14:20] whole world this also that she hath done
[14:22] shall be spoken of for a memorial of her
[14:27] and judas iscariot one of the twelve
[14:29] went on to the chief priests to betray
[14:31] him unto them
[14:32] and when they heard it they were glad
[14:34] and promised to give him money
[14:36] and he sought how he might conveniently
[14:38] betray him
[14:41] and the first day of unleavened bread
[14:43] when they killed the passover his
[14:44] disciples said unto him where wilt thou
[14:47] that we go and prepare that thou mayest
[14:49] eat the passover
[14:50] and he sendeth forth two of his
[14:52] disciples and seth unto them go ye into
[14:54] the city and there shall meet you a man
[14:56] bearing a pitcher of water
[14:58] follow him
[14:59] and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to
[15:02] the goodman of the house the master
[15:04] saith where is the guest chamber where i
[15:06] shall eat the passover with my disciples
[15:09] and he will show you a large upper room
[15:11] furnished and prepared
[15:13] there make ready for us
[15:16] and his disciples went forth and came
[15:17] into the city and found as he had said
[15:19] unto them and they made ready the
[15:21] passover
[15:23] and in the evening he cometh with the
[15:25] twelve
[15:26] and as they sat and did eat jesus said
[15:29] verily i say unto you one of you which
[15:31] eateth with me shall betray me
[15:34] and they began to be sorrowful and to
[15:35] say unto him one by one is it i and
[15:37] another said is it i and he answered and
[15:40] said unto them
[15:42] it is one of the twelve that tipth with
[15:44] me in the dish
[15:46] the son of man indeed goeth as it is
[15:48] written of him
[15:49] but woe to that man by whom the son of
[15:52] man is
[15:52] betrayed good were it for that man if he
[15:55] had never been born
[15:57] and as they did eat jesus took bread and
[16:00] blessed and break it and gave to them
[16:02] and said take eat
[16:05] this is my body
[16:07] and he took the cup
[16:08] and when he had given thanks he gave it
[16:10] to them and they all drank of it
[16:12] and he said unto them this is my blood
[16:15] of the new testament
[16:16] which is shed for many
[16:19] verily i say unto you i will drink no
[16:21] more of the fruit of the vine until that
[16:23] day that i drink it new in the kingdom
[16:25] of god
[16:27] and when they had sung in hymn they went
[16:29] out into the mount of olives
[16:31] and jesus saith unto them
[16:33] all ye shall be offended because of me
[16:35] this night
[16:36] for it is written i will smite the
[16:38] shepherd and the sheep shall be
[16:40] scattered
[16:41] but after that i am risen i will go
[16:43] before you into galilee
[16:46] but peter said unto him although all
[16:48] shall be offended yet will not i
[16:50] and jesus saith unto him verily i say
[16:52] unto thee that this day
[16:54] even in this night
[16:56] before the crow twice
[16:58] thou shalt deny me thrice
[17:01] but he spake the more vehemently if i
[17:03] should die with thee i will not deny
[17:05] thee in any wise
[17:06] likewise also said they all
[17:10] and they came to a place which was named
[17:12] gethsemane
[17:13] and he saith to his disciples sit ye
[17:15] here while i shall
[17:17] and he taketh with him peter and james
[17:19] and john and began to be sore amazed and
[17:22] to be very heavy
[17:24] and saith unto them
[17:26] my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto
[17:28] death
[17:30] tarry ye here and watch
[17:32] and he went forward a little
[17:34] and fell on the ground
[17:36] and prayed that if it were possible the
[17:38] hour might pass from him
[17:41] and he said
[17:42] abba
[17:43] father
[17:45] all things are possible unto thee
[17:48] take away this cup from me
[17:51] nevertheless
[17:52] not what i will
[17:54] but what thou wilt
[17:57] and he cometh and findeth them sleeping
[17:59] and seth unto peter
[18:00] simon sleepest thou couldest not thou
[18:03] watch one hour
[18:05] watch ye and pray lest ye enter into
[18:07] temptation
[18:08] the spirit truly is ready but the flesh
[18:11] is weak
[18:13] and again he went away and prayed and
[18:15] spake the same words
[18:17] and when he returned he found them
[18:19] asleep again for their eyes were heavy
[18:21] neither whisked they what to answer him
[18:24] and he cometh the third time and saith
[18:27] unto them sleep on now and take your
[18:29] rest
[18:30] it is enough
[18:32] the hour has come
[18:35] behold the son of man is betrayed into
[18:37] the hands of sinners
[18:39] rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth
[18:41] me is at hand
[18:43] and immediately while he yet spake
[18:45] cometh judas one of the twelve and with
[18:46] him a great multitude with swords and
[18:48] staves from the chief priests and the
[18:50] scribes and the elders and he that
[18:52] betrayed him had given them a token
[18:54] saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same
[18:56] as he take him and lead him away safely
[18:59] and as soon as he was come he go
[19:01] straightway to him and said master
[19:03] master and kissed him
[19:05] and they laid their hands on him and
[19:07] took him and one of them that stood by
[19:09] drew a sword and smote a servant of the
[19:11] high priest and cut off his ear
[19:14] and jesus answered and said unto them
[19:16] are ye come out as against a thief with
[19:19] swords and with staves to take me
[19:22] i was daily with you in the temple
[19:23] teaching and you took me not
[19:25] but the scriptures must be fulfilled
[19:29] and they all forsook him and fled
[19:33] and there followed him a certain young
[19:34] man having a linen cloth cast about his
[19:36] naked body and the young men laid hold
[19:39] on him and he left the linen cloth and
[19:41] fled from them naked
[19:44] and they led jesus away to the high
[19:45] priest and with him would assembled all
[19:47] the chief priests and the elders and the
[19:49] scribes
[19:50] and peta followed him afar off
[20:22] and the chief priests and all the
[20:24] council sought for witness against jesus
[20:26] to put him to death and found none for
[20:28] many bear false witness against him but
[20:30] their witness agreed not together
[20:33] and there arose certain and bear false
[20:35] witness against him saying we heard him
[20:38] say i will destroy this temple that is
[20:40] made with hands and within three days i
[20:42] will build another made without hands
[20:45] but neither so did their witness agree
[20:47] together
[20:49] and the high priest stood up in the
[20:50] midst and asked jesus saying
[20:53] answer is thou nothing
[20:55] what is it which these witness against
[20:56] thee
[20:58] but he held his peace and answered
[20:59] nothing
[21:01] again the high priest asked him and said
[21:02] unto him art thou the christ the son of
[21:05] the blessed
[21:06] and jesus said
[21:08] i am
[21:09] and ye shall see the son of man sitting
[21:11] on the right hand of power and coming in
[21:13] the clouds of heaven
[21:16] then the high priest rent his clothes
[21:17] and saith what need we any further
[21:19] witnesses ye have heard the blasphemy
[21:22] what think ye
[21:23] and they all condemned him to be guilty
[21:25] of death
[21:26] and some began to spit on him and to
[21:27] cover his face and to buffet him and to
[21:29] say unto him prophesy and the servants
[21:32] did strike him with the palms of their
[21:33] hands
[21:35] and as peter was beneath in the palace
[21:38] there cometh one of the maids of the
[21:39] high priest and when she saw peter
[21:42] warming himself she looked upon him and
[21:44] said
[21:45] and thou also washed with jesus of
[21:47] nazareth
[21:48] but he denied saying
[21:50] i know not neither understand i what the
[21:52] hell sayest
[21:54] and he went out into the porch
[21:56] and the crew
[21:58] and a maid saw him again and began to
[22:00] say to them that stood by this is one of
[22:02] them and he denied it again
[22:05] and a little after they that stood by
[22:07] said again to peter surely thou art one
[22:09] of them for thou art a galilean and thy
[22:11] speech agreeth thereto
[22:13] but he began to curse and to swear
[22:15] saying i know not this man of whom ye
[22:17] speak
[22:18] and the second time the crew
[22:22] and peter called to mind the word that
[22:24] jesus said unto him before the crow
[22:27] twice
[22:28] thou shalt deny me thrice
[22:31] and when he thought thereon he wept
[22:40] straightway in the morning the chief
[22:41] priests held a consultation with the
[22:43] elders and scribes and the whole council
[22:46] and bound jesus and carried him away and
[22:47] delivered him to pilate
[22:49] and pilate asked him art thou the king
[22:51] of the jews
[22:53] and he answering said unto him
[22:55] thou sayest it
[22:57] and the chief priests accused him of
[22:59] many things
[23:00] but he answered nothing
[23:02] and pilate asked him again saying answer
[23:04] is thou nothing behold how many things
[23:06] they witness against thee
[23:08] but jesus yet answered nothing so that
[23:11] pilate marveled
[23:13] now at that feast he released unto them
[23:15] one prisoner whomsoever they desired
[23:18] and there was one named barabbas which
[23:20] lay bound with them that had made
[23:21] insurrection with him who had committed
[23:23] murder in the insurrection
[23:25] and the multitude crying aloud began to
[23:27] desire him to do as he had ever done
[23:29] unto them but pilate answered them
[23:31] saying
[23:32] will ye that i release unto you the king
[23:34] of the jews for he knew that the chief
[23:37] priests had delivered him for envy
[23:39] but the chief priests moved the people
[23:41] that he should rather release barabbas
[23:43] unto them
[23:44] and pilate answered and said again unto
[23:46] them what will ye then that i shall do
[23:48] unto him whom ye call the king of the
[23:49] jews
[23:50] and they cried out again crucify him
[23:54] then pilate said unto them
[23:56] why what evil hath he done and they
[23:58] cried out the more exceedingly crucify
[24:01] him
[24:02] and so pilate willing to content the
[24:04] people released barabbas unto them and
[24:06] delivered jesus when he had scourged him
[24:08] to be crucified
[24:10] and the soldiers led him away into the
[24:11] hall called praetorium and they called
[24:14] together the whole band
[24:15] and they clothed him with purple and
[24:17] platted a crown of thorns and put it
[24:19] about his head and began to salute him
[24:22] hail king of the jews
[24:24] and they smote him on the head with the
[24:25] reed and did spit upon him and bowing
[24:28] their knees worshipped him
[24:30] and when they had mocked him they took
[24:32] off the purple from him and put his own
[24:34] clothes on him and led him out to
[24:36] crucify him
[24:37] and they compelled one simon a cyrenian
[24:40] who passed by coming out of the country
[24:42] the father of alexander and rufus to
[24:44] bear his cross
[24:46] and they bring him onto the place
[24:47] golgotha which is being interpreted the
[24:50] place of a skull
[24:52] and they gave him to drink wine mingled
[24:54] with myrrh
[24:55] but he received it not
[24:58] and when they had crucified him they
[25:00] parted his garments casting lots upon
[25:02] them what every man should take
[25:05] and it was the third hour and they
[25:07] crucified him
[25:08] and the superscription of his accusation
[25:10] was written over
[25:11] the king of the jews and with him they
[25:14] crucified two thieves the one in his
[25:17] right hand and the other on his left
[25:19] and the scripture was fulfilled with
[25:21] seth and he was numbered with the
[25:23] transgressors
[25:25] and they that passed by railed on him
[25:27] wagging their heads and saying ah thou
[25:29] that destroyest the temple and buildest
[25:31] it in three days save thyself and come
[25:34] down from the cross
[25:36] likewise also the chief priests mocking
[25:38] said among themselves with the scribes
[25:40] he saved others himself he cannot save
[25:43] let christ the king of israel descend
[25:45] now from the cross that we may see and
[25:47] believe
[25:48] and they that were crucified with him
[25:50] reviled him
[25:52] and when the sixth hour was come
[25:55] there was darkness over the whole land
[25:57] until the ninth hour
[25:59] and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a
[26:02] loud voice saying
[26:06] i
[26:07] which is being interpreted my god my god
[26:10] why hast thou forsaken me
[26:13] and some of them that stood by when they
[26:14] heard it said behold he calleth elias
[26:17] and one ran and filled a sponge full of
[26:19] vinegar and put it on a reed and gave
[26:21] him to drink saying let alone let us see
[26:23] whether elias will come to take him down
[26:27] and jesus cried with a loud voice and
[26:29] gave up the ghost
[26:32] and the veil of the temple
[26:34] was rent in twain from the top to the
[26:36] bottom
[26:38] and when the centurion which stood over
[26:40] against him saw that he so cried out and
[26:42] gave up the ghost he said truly
[26:45] this man was the son of god
[26:48] there were also women looking on a far
[26:49] off among whom was mary magdalene
[26:52] and mary the mother of james the less
[26:54] and of joseph and salome
[26:57] who also when he was in galilee followed
[26:59] him and ministered unto him
[27:01] and many other women which came up with
[27:03] him unto jerusalem
[27:05] and now when the even was come
[27:08] because it was the preparation that is
[27:10] the day before the sabbath
[27:11] joseph of arimathea an honorable
[27:14] counselor which also waited for the
[27:15] kingdom of god came and went in boldly
[27:18] unto pilate and craved the body of jesus
[27:21] and pilate marveled if he were already
[27:23] dead
[27:24] and calling unto him the centurion he
[27:26] asked him whether he had been any while
[27:28] dead
[27:30] and when he knew it of the centurion he
[27:32] gave the body to joseph
[27:34] and he bought fine linen and took him
[27:36] down and wrapped him in the linen and
[27:39] laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn
[27:41] out of a rock and rolled a stone onto
[27:43] the door of the sepulcher
[27:46] and mary magdalene and mary the mother
[27:48] of joseph beheld where he was laid
[28:00] [Music]
[28:35] so
[28:36] [Music]
[28:54] you
