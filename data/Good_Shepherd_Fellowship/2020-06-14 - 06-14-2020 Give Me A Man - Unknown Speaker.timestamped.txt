[25:15] just thank God but I had this thought on
[25:18] my mind I'm going to get out of our bulk
[25:21] of our series and I just wanted to use

[25:28] us as brothers sons and daughters of God
[25:32] and just believe in that logo
[25:35] we bless blessed in in helpers this

[26:47] so let's just turn to our Bibles first
[26:53] Kings chapter 17 we want to read from
[26:56] here for some you yeah I think I needed
[27:15] praise the Lord praise the Lord in you
[27:20] know when you when you grow up together
[27:23] and you get to know one another life
[27:25] just become so nice you know it's become
[27:28] so easy praise the Lord
[27:32] for some you chapter seventeen let's
[27:41] read from verse one just for the
[27:42] scripture reading now the Philistines
[27:45] gathered together their army to battle
[27:48] and we gather together in Chaka which
[27:54] belongeth to Judah and page between show
[27:58] her and I as occur in infra didim and so
[28:05] in his men and the men of Israel would
[28:08] gather together in page by the Valley of
[28:11] Elah and and there the battle and and
[28:15] set the battle in raid against the
[28:18] Philistines and the Philistine stood on
[28:20] the mountain on the one side and Ezra
[28:23] stood on a mountain on the other side
[28:26] and there was a valley between them a
[28:31] valley of decision and there went out a
[28:37] champion out of the camp of the
[28:40] Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose
[28:45] height was his cubed and as
[28:50] and he had an helming of brides upon his
[28:54] head and his arm with coats of mail and
[29:01] weight and the weight of the coat was
[29:03] five thousand shekels of bronze and had
[29:08] Greve of brides upon his legs and the
[29:12] target of brides between his shoulder I
[29:14] mean this guy was wear dress and the
[29:17] staff of his spear was like the weaving
[29:22] beam in his spearhead weighed six
[29:26] hundred shekels of onion everything
[29:29] about him is just six and one bear in
[29:33] the shape a share went before him and he
[29:36] is told and cry on to the army of Israel
[29:41] and said unto them why are ye come out
[29:45] to set your battle in the red not I a
[29:51] Philistine and year sevens of soul
[29:54] choose you a man for you and let him
[30:01] come down to me if he be able to fight
[30:06] me and kill me then we then will we be
[30:12] your seven but if I prevailed against
[30:16] him and kill him then shall ye be our
[30:19] seven and self and the Philistine said I
[30:24] defy the army of Israel this thing give
[30:28] me a man that we may fight together
[30:34] Romans chapter 8 you may have your seat
[30:37] while we read their portion of the world
[30:39] Romans chapter 8
[30:55] praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 let's
[30:58] read from verse 18 for I reckon they're
[31:06] the sufferings of this present time and
[31:09] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[31:13] which shall be revealed in us for the
[31:19] earnest expectation of the creature
[31:22] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[31:26] sons of God let's pray together Heavenly
[31:29] Father Lord Jesus what what hope work
[31:34] what comfort from your word the Lord our
[31:38] present suffering in a sense the things
[31:41] that we have to deal with in this age
[31:43] the spirit that are warring against us
[31:46] the things that are on the news they can
[31:49] never be compared to the glory that with
[31:52] us so why should we feel our mind with
[31:56] him why Lord should we get our spirit or
[31:59] wrap up in these things that are just
[32:01] temporary help us Lord we can live for
[32:05] our hair so Godfather because our
[32:08] Redemption draws nigh but Lord also like
[32:11] the Apostle Paul said it can now be
[32:14] compared to the glory that will be
[32:16] revealed in us because the creation is
[32:22] waiting to see that glory and that glory
[32:24] is when we are some daughters of God
[32:28] begin to manifest ourselves begin to
[32:32] live like a son of God like a daughter
[32:34] of God father we just ask him grace this
[32:38] morning Lord come and help us Lord as we
[32:41] approach this word this morning we want
[32:44] to just ask your blessings in Jesus name
[32:47] we pray amen amen praise the Lord this
[32:52] morning well if this was a holiday I
[32:58] would dedicate this message to the
[33:00] brothers but maybe you can I won't just
[33:04] speak on a little talk give me the man
[33:07] give me a man
[33:10] praise Lord I'm just trusting that the
[33:15] law would just be able to keep me in a
[33:17] channel of of what I have just like
[33:22] brother Scott said it was good for us to
[33:24] get out there yesterday then invasive
[33:28] with the brothers and we just started
[33:30] talking about few things how to prepare
[33:33] ourselves to come back and we will be
[33:36] bringing you those report when we really
[33:39] establish our thoughts and but moreover
[33:44] what I was really looking forward to
[33:47] that beside the things we had to talk
[33:51] about a really wonderful us to have a
[33:54] time of Prayer like like we did
[33:57] yesterday and and and just like I said
[34:00] we are looking looking forward to more
[34:03] of there where we can come together as
[34:05] brothers as men of the church and have I
[34:09] mean we have gone away from our main
[34:11] Bible studies I mean it's long overdue
[34:16] so and we are hoping also that when we
[34:21] get back to church I was sharing with
[34:23] the brothers you know yesterday morning
[34:27] and I was thinking about it you know you
[34:32] wake up in the morning you try to put
[34:34] something on your mind
[34:35] and you thinking sometimes those
[34:39] thoughts stay on your mind and you try
[34:40] to slip back into into sleep so I don't
[34:44] know why it was it was like a dream
[34:46] right between sleep in a way trying to
[34:48] meditate and I was just thinking about
[34:50] the meeting and thinking about us coming
[34:53] back and it was just like a thought that
[34:58] came back to me the way to come back is
[35:00] the way of Prayer and I appreciate their
[35:04] you know I appreciate their and I felt
[35:07] like it was gold giving me in a
[35:08] direction that is the better way to come
[35:11] back because we can never find our way
[35:13] back if we are not praying so I hope not
[35:17] only the the the brothers you know
[35:20] the sisters the young people most
[35:23] especially we will have time to spend
[35:25] with them in having the prayer meeting
[35:27] not just coming and talking all the
[35:31] things we've been talking they are good
[35:33] we will catch up back on those things
[35:35] but we would love to spend more time in
[35:38] pray I want to start this morning with
[35:40] this little talk from Brad Branham so
[35:43] you can see where I will be heading this
[35:45] morning looking to the unseen brother
[35:49] Branham says we are fighting here
[35:50] tonight a great warfare right against
[35:58] wrong Word of God against modern to
[36:05] logic and trying to make the Word of God
[36:10] or bring it to the people why the enemy
[36:14] will try to be set it in every way now
[36:20] as a church with everything that is
[36:23] going on everything that is going on I
[36:27] mean in the word in the media we have to
[36:30] know that the things that are happening
[36:32] out there they they are more days I mean
[36:36] the go so deep is so spiritual then the
[36:41] newspaper can present it you know the
[36:45] newspaper or the media there will be
[36:47] either appealing to one group or another
[36:50] but we have to know that God has called
[36:53] us to the Ministry of reconciliation and
[36:56] to stand as a mediator mediator don't
[36:59] take sighs you have to stand in the
[37:03] middle and that's what we are called to
[37:06] do that is the only way we can we can
[37:10] get into the ministry of being to
[37:14] intercede for you to intercede you don't
[37:19] take science you have to listen to the
[37:23] both sides you have to bring all the
[37:25] story together sober bellum is giving us
[37:29] a picture year that we are fighting a
[37:31] great warfare and it's one
[37:34] right against wrong and majorly the word
[37:38] the word of God against the present
[37:41] society that we are dealing with praise
[37:46] the Lord the present age did this is the
[37:52] age I call in to Apostle Paul were Satan
[37:57] is the god of this evil age and just
[38:02] like the scripture says he know that his
[38:05] time is over and he's going to do
[38:09] whatever he can to rip our mind apart to
[38:15] to rip our homes apart he's going to do
[38:18] whatever he can I love the way Brennan
[38:22] said here he says we're trying to bring
[38:24] the Word of God to the people and the
[38:26] enemy is also trying to beset us he
[38:31] caused little things to happen and then
[38:34] people question in their mind where is
[38:36] God how can these things be happening to
[38:42] kick us off our faith and get trouble in
[38:44] our mind but that it is that is what is
[38:47] going on
[38:55] praise the Lord
[38:59] so we want to use that realizing there
[39:04] we have a great warfare before us it's a
[39:10] warfare that is between right and wrong
[39:14] and we are living in an in this age
[39:18] where right is no longer defined by
[39:22] God's Word right is defined by popular
[39:28] demand what a piece to the population is
[39:32] right but we know our sons and daughters
[39:38] of God and as Christians let every man
[39:41] be alive and go word with stand alone
[39:46] to be the truth and to be right so if
[39:51] you want to be right you got to take
[39:53] science with God's Word you got to take
[39:59] sides with God's Word if you can't take
[40:01] science with God's Word
[40:02] forget about it your opinion will never
[40:05] be right are we together because I mean
[40:16] actually with this warfare that we are
[40:19] dealing with it goes down to our roots
[40:23] it goes back way back to our roots and
[40:27] that's some of the things that we want
[40:29] to talk about because I believe we have
[40:32] that responsibility to be able to look
[40:36] at these things
[40:37] in the light of God's Word praise the
[40:41] Lord amen
[40:45] I have a you know just just talking to a
[40:49] few brothers you know and and you you
[40:52] talk to people whether out of the
[40:56] country or in the country
[40:59] like I said Minneapolis has got on hair
[41:03] line so that's not your talk you know
[41:05] what's going on in your city and people
[41:07] want to just roll you into everything
[41:09] that is happening you know and you know
[41:12] and I just just have the grace to be
[41:15] able to help them to see it more than
[41:17] the politics because if you don't look
[41:20] at it more than the politics you will
[41:22] never get it right you will never get it
[41:27] right we have to know there's a spirit
[41:33] there's a spirit
[41:39] praise the Lord
[41:42] amen so that's why we want to look at
[41:45] this morning we all know our our story
[41:50] set forth before us that is Goliath and
[41:53] that's when little David would come on
[41:56] the scene but year Israel was standing
[41:59] in the valley of decision remember that
[42:06] they have rejected the leadership of God
[42:09] under the Prophet ministry
[42:12] Samuel they wanted to be like all the
[42:18] other nations so God gave them a king
[42:22] after the heart soul and it was not too
[42:27] long and God would do that all the time
[42:31] he would not allow you to go very long
[42:35] for him to make you to know that your
[42:38] choice was not good for you and not too
[42:42] long yes a Israel is faced with this
[42:46] challenge and the Philistines want to
[42:50] rule him why because the Philistines
[42:53] have been ruling them through the time
[42:55] of the judges they knew that they could
[42:59] break right in dead you know and take
[43:02] their habits and then take their women
[43:04] in and and enslaved their children so I
[43:07] mean they were they were attempting all
[43:09] the time and that's what the devil does
[43:10] you know when he gets us into things and
[43:13] God deliver us he stay come around he
[43:16] remind you of those things he tried to
[43:18] appeal to your flesh because he knew one
[43:20] time he had access to that so he
[43:23] believed that he can always have access
[43:25] to that and where Benham says that is
[43:27] the thing that we must keep under the
[43:29] blood praise the Lord
[43:33] and year is Israel right in this valley
[43:36] of decision a great warfare before them
[43:44] and pretty soon the people are thinking
[43:47] in their mind you know because you have
[43:50] to remember before this time Saul has
[43:53] warned about Oh for Israel
[43:56] before this time the people has enjoyed
[44:00] a sense of his leadership all they saw
[44:04] him on the mountain prophesying with the
[44:06] prophets and and in all of these things
[44:08] but yearís said now the people were
[44:11] looking to see what is going to happen
[44:14] quiet silence all over the place every
[44:17] house was quarantined shut down praise
[44:22] the Lord I will tell you that even the
[44:25] coronavirus is a great warfare it's a
[44:27] spirit has come to just rip the word of
[44:33] joy take the voice of the bridegroom in
[44:40] the music away like in the days of the
[44:44] captivity quietness and this great
[44:47] warfare was standing before Israel and
[44:50] the people everybody talking in the home
[44:54] thinking what to do and even saw a skier
[44:58] for his life but just like the scripture
[45:03] says dear
[45:04] saw I mean Elias - before the cam of
[45:09] Israel and says just give me the man
[45:17] just give me a man what a great
[45:22] challenge and in that challenge also
[45:26] hold a great understanding if he only
[45:32] knew that God's majority is only in one
[45:36] man praise the Lord he was asking for
[45:42] God's majority just give me a man we
[45:48] don't have to share blood we don't have
[45:51] to and and and I'm telling you that's
[45:54] what the word is asking for the word is
[45:57] saying give us a man and man that can
[45:59] solve this problem praise the Lord
[46:04] but the owner man that can solve this
[46:07] problem is the man the Lord
[46:09] as Christ he's the only man that can
[46:13] solve this problem because he has
[46:15] already shear his blood
[46:17] pay the price to redeem the world and he
[46:20] will be the only man that will put an
[46:22] end to this not the Pope no leader he
[46:31] says give me the man a me so we realize
[46:44] if we take this back you realize that
[46:47] back in Genesis back to the beginning
[46:50] God created man male and female created
[46:55] he them in his image that's Genesis
[46:58] chapter 126 we are familiar with that
[47:01] chapter - God took both the male and the
[47:05] female that was created in His image put
[47:09] them in a body form now God was
[47:11] establishing something I put in both the
[47:15] male and the female in the same body all
[47:18] of the headship of the meal before he
[47:22] will let her take out the female what
[47:24] was he establishing he was establishing
[47:27] hashing God was establishing her shape
[47:35] it was an order that God will use all
[47:39] through time by bringing the man for
[47:44] first even though both the man and the
[47:47] woman was created in the image of God
[47:50] but when he expressed them when he
[47:52] manifests them he put the woman all of
[47:56] the headship of the man by expressing
[47:58] the man first in flesh and then bringing
[48:00] the woman out so he was setting an order
[48:04] and all of that he would bless an order
[48:08] that will always prosper before him and
[48:14] you can see how it was
[48:17] he plays Adam there in the Garden of
[48:20] Eden he gives him Dominion he gives
[48:22] power for him to control the earth being
[48:26] an amateur god rule the garden the
[48:29] animals the tree everything God was
[48:31] establishing a principle and he blessed
[48:37] it that way
[48:38] praise the Lord and no sense in there
[48:43] God was manifest in his attribute and
[48:46] the things that he was going to do yeah
[48:49] he was empowering the male he was giving
[48:56] him responsibility to be able to govern
[49:01] to be able to rule to be able to take
[49:06] care of the creation that he has made
[49:10] that's the reason why the Bible says he
[49:14] said let us make man in our image and
[49:17] God made man in His image
[49:19] it keeps saying there over and over
[49:22] because God was establishing a principle
[49:28] praise the Lord the principle of hair
[49:33] shape the principle of leadership and
[49:41] honor this principle that God was
[49:45] establishing he established a man and
[49:48] placed a man to the place word he will
[49:52] be a leader he will be a provider he
[49:58] will be able to manage the thing that a
[50:01] father has placed in his hands and Adam
[50:04] spent a wide in the Garden of Eden he
[50:06] names all the trees and he named the
[50:08] animal and he named all of these things
[50:10] just a form of leadership being a
[50:14] supervisor that's the reason why in a
[50:17] country we have a precedent in a company
[50:20] we had the director whoever is the head
[50:22] there in a little group we have a soup
[50:25] every word as a form of leader can you
[50:31] imagine a world where there is no one we
[50:33] can no one we can hold accountable no
[50:35] one we can
[50:36] Porto what world will be living in God
[50:40] was certain an order of leadership and
[50:45] honor this order of leadership would
[50:48] come great responsibility and I believe
[50:53] that is what we are dealing with because
[50:55] when we fail to to hold ourselves
[50:58] accountable for the place that God had
[51:03] put us and the responsibility that is
[51:05] given to us then we try to start finding
[51:08] excuses
[51:14] give me the man praise the Lord
[51:29] Paul tells us that the creation is
[51:34] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[51:37] of the sons of God and what is that
[51:41] manifestation the very same
[51:42] responsibility that God gave to Adam in
[51:45] the beginning that he lost Christ has
[51:47] come to restore us back to that place
[51:52] through the cross through the blood he
[51:55] has shared and giving his spirit back on
[51:57] the days of Pentecost is to bring us
[52:00] back to that place let's look at some of
[52:10] these things this morning as we were
[52:13] just stated together lifting him out of
[52:16] history it seems like the home life is
[52:19] running out into shadow waters it used
[52:26] to be in a home the father the head of
[52:29] the house who sit down of the morning
[52:33] and he will speak with his family and
[52:38] they will all take out the old family
[52:43] Bible and read just a little bit and
[52:48] gathered around the table and have
[52:50] Prayer you don't see that no more and
[52:55] when the day was done and mom had the
[53:00] dishes watch they were all gathered in
[53:03] and read some more of the Bible and pray
[53:07] before they go to bed now you see their
[53:14] their responsibilities of hair shape and
[53:18] leadership that was given to Adam you
[53:20] realize in the Bible that after God gave
[53:24] Adam that responsibility and Eve was
[53:27] brought into the picture the Bible says
[53:29] that God who come down in the cool of
[53:32] the evening to be able to instruct them
[53:35] in his word instruct him in fellowship
[53:37] he will come down after they have gone
[53:39] through their best work and
[53:41] thing they have to do he will come in
[53:43] the evening and you will have fellowship
[53:45] with his children why because that was
[53:48] an expression there was an expression of
[53:50] what was in the father's mind for him to
[53:55] be able to gather with all of his
[53:57] attributes give us a man praise the Lord
[54:09] I mean as we as we approach Father's Day
[54:17] as we think about everything that is
[54:19] happening out there I will tell you the
[54:22] problem of today's society is because we
[54:26] have destroyed this principle we have
[54:29] got away that the family life has got
[54:32] away from this principle and all that is
[54:36] happening out there and everything that
[54:38] is happening in the world today is just
[54:44] show how far our society has gone away
[54:47] from God it sure how much fathers have
[54:53] let down their god-given responsibility
[54:59] praise the Lord
[55:00] I mean for the remnant that is in that
[55:04] is in Israel for the little ones that
[55:07] God is still dealing with your heart
[55:09] let's look at these things in a line of
[55:11] God's Word because if we feel we would
[55:15] get back to the same place church will
[55:18] be a form memory you will forget about
[55:20] those good old days that's how they call
[55:22] it when those good old days and still
[55:25] the same good old days because God is
[55:27] still the same he's not a historical God
[55:32] we are having all the problem that we
[55:35] are having in our society today is
[55:38] because we have left the principle of
[55:40] God we have fell God on the
[55:44] responsibility that he has given us we
[55:51] have left our children to be taught by
[55:52] the Internet
[55:54] we left our children to be taught by
[55:57] society we put our children in the hands
[56:01] of Hollywood to teach them that's the
[56:05] problem we are having because that's
[56:12] there is just no there is no dividing
[56:15] lines there is no dividing lines home
[56:27] life like brother Branham said has run
[56:30] into shadow waters you hear people
[56:37] talking about I mean when we were
[56:39] growing up what happened with when we
[56:42] were growing up and now they'll talk
[56:48] about how their parents brought them up
[56:50] and the things that they used to do why
[56:52] are we not applying in our homes why are
[56:55] we not a planet in this society that we
[56:58] ain't home life is all gone into shadow
[57:07] waters family structure is in crisis but
[57:20] the creation is waiting for the
[57:22] manifestation of the sons of God they
[57:25] are people whose life can still make a
[57:29] difference and that's why we are called
[57:32] to be we are called to be their voice we
[57:41] are called to be their voice less people
[57:43] talks about the politics let them talk
[57:45] about everything that is happy now they
[57:47] and bring them back to whom life if a
[57:52] man has a brain to think he would say
[57:55] that is truth bring them back to whom
[58:00] life lets people have all the arguments
[58:02] down there and just bring up a
[58:05] conversation past
[58:07] fathers have filled their songs they
[58:12] have filled their songs instead of
[58:13] teaching a young man how to be
[58:16] respectful the moment he gets 2 years
[58:19] old he lived from his knees and stand up
[58:22] we pierce his ears
[58:23] we put tattooed on his body we start
[58:25] preparing him the Bible says God make
[58:33] man English in His image
[58:35] and he breathed into man for man to
[58:38] become a living soul if we don't have
[58:41] the Spirit of God to lead us in the
[58:43] things that he want us to do we become a
[58:46] beasts not too far from the animals give
[59:02] us a man that's what that's that's the
[59:07] cry that is out there give us a man and
[59:12] looking for the next man to come in
[59:14] office you're looking for the next man
[59:16] to rule the world and looking for the
[59:18] next man that would be the voice there
[59:23] was a man I was hanging between heaven
[59:24] and earth
[59:28] and man I was willing to give his life
[59:33] and yet we would not receive it yet who
[59:36] they would make fun out of it but that
[59:40] was the only man that was saying to be
[59:45] able to solve this word same problem
[59:51] that's what our problem is that's that's
[59:54] the kind of warfare that is before us
[59:57] because it's what our society is dealing
[1:00:00] with because we have fell on our
[1:00:06] god-given responsibility
[1:00:13] we are looking for somebody to blame
[1:00:18] praise the Lord I'm just I'm just
[1:00:22] preaching my heart this morning I'm not
[1:00:24] looking to be famous that's that's
[1:00:28] that's the burden that is that is on my
[1:00:30] heart
[1:00:43] you
[1:00:49] automatically self amen
[1:00:56] verbatim saying the message here you him
[1:00:58] he said a man is not measure but how
[1:01:02] much muscle he got he says there's a
[1:01:12] beast I've seen man they weigh 200
[1:01:16] pounds and didn't have an ounce of men
[1:01:19] in them what is what is what is man
[1:01:26] what is man David asked that question in
[1:01:30] the Sam he says what is man that you are
[1:01:34] so mindful of him the scripture use the
[1:01:39] word and God speaks to the prophets and
[1:01:41] called him the son of man that has a
[1:01:46] very deep meaning it has the meaning
[1:01:49] word God in a way that God express
[1:01:55] himself because remember this was God
[1:02:02] saying we make man in our image so that
[1:02:11] word man does not have anything to do
[1:02:14] with the width of our muscles or the
[1:02:18] intelligence of our brain it's a channel
[1:02:28] where the invisible God becomes visible
[1:02:33] and he's able to do those things that he
[1:02:39] desired to do but yet he has a body that
[1:02:43] he can be able to do them physically
[1:02:48] what is man that you visit him and the
[1:02:54] son of man are you liking yourself onto
[1:02:57] him
[1:03:04] give us a man 200 pounds and then have
[1:03:14] an ounce of man in him throw a baby out
[1:03:17] of a mother's arm I mean man has just
[1:03:19] now become I mean I mean you're you you
[1:03:23] have to be the man when when people
[1:03:25] cease their you have to be the man it
[1:03:27] just looked like some kind of for
[1:03:29] control it looks like some kind of you
[1:03:33] you have to be either our again or you
[1:03:37] have to I mean you have to stand up and
[1:03:39] be and just show something completely
[1:03:42] different from what God designed a man
[1:03:45] to be man has taken this violent form if
[1:04:04] you're to be a man you gotta raise your
[1:04:06] voice a little bit you got to show some
[1:04:09] physical emotion but remember it was
[1:04:19] Almighty God making man in His image man
[1:04:27] was something to resemble God something
[1:04:33] that is made in the image of another it
[1:04:36] has a likeness it has a resemblance
[1:04:45] and when God even before he said let us
[1:04:49] make man as a spirit God what he did he
[1:04:54] says let there be light he I mean he
[1:04:56] created a word he took darkness away I
[1:05:00] mean he brought life into the earth he
[1:05:03] created treason and I mean he was doing
[1:05:06] stuff when he expressed himself he was
[1:05:11] not destroying and
[1:05:13] sending lightning and turned out all
[1:05:15] over the place even before he said let
[1:05:18] us make man in our image he was being
[1:05:20] creative he was being productive that
[1:05:26] was the image that God was forming to
[1:05:30] express himself in yet this man will go
[1:05:33] from the hands of God being an amateur
[1:05:36] creator creating an atmosphere in a home
[1:05:39] where children will be saved and and and
[1:05:42] and the wife will be happy and family
[1:05:45] can come in and go out and be glad that
[1:05:51] was the form that was the expression
[1:05:53] that he was expressing himself not
[1:05:56] violence there was never a man like
[1:06:08] Christ Jesus never was a character like
[1:06:15] that praise the Lord well we can say
[1:06:23] there Moses did not give us a lot about
[1:06:26] Adam just told us about the garden told
[1:06:30] us about the falling in this and man
[1:06:33] fell but God was still not satisfied
[1:06:36] because all that man has represented
[1:06:39] through the ages never came close to
[1:06:42] what was in the heart of God for what a
[1:06:45] man is
[1:06:46] so God himself had to come down in the
[1:06:50] form of flesh to really be able to
[1:06:53] express what his heart of a man is so he
[1:07:02] took the form of flesh he never
[1:07:10] that's a telling years old man dropping
[1:07:12] down from heaven he came I so baby you
[1:07:17] know what Luke said about him that he
[1:07:21] ruled in wisdom and stature in wisdom
[1:07:27] and stature you look you look over in
[1:07:29] the book of Proverbs you counted how
[1:07:31] many times Solomon said my son that's
[1:07:37] that's the way man is formed man is
[1:07:40] formed by installing into him godly
[1:07:43] principles man is formed but that's not
[1:07:48] girl for me he breathed into man the
[1:07:51] breath of God is the word of God is the
[1:07:53] life of God that's not a man is formed
[1:07:56] by installing the Word of God in him how
[1:08:01] can a young man david said nor his ways
[1:08:04] by taking heed to the Word of God that's
[1:08:08] how man is formed it's not bad that the
[1:08:12] the new rap music that is outside and
[1:08:15] the new I mean that it's social warfare
[1:08:18] how they praise the Lord
[1:08:24] well it'll be to God I pray that the law
[1:08:30] would just help us here that's a
[1:08:37] responsibility that has come to us you
[1:08:42] think about it look at him a young man
[1:08:45] like Jeremiah being born in a time where
[1:08:49] Israel has gone away from God and God
[1:08:58] has already honor as I am ministry he
[1:09:04] has already said to Hezekiah how the
[1:09:08] Babylonians is going to sow so Jeremiah
[1:09:11] was born right in the time of captivity
[1:09:14] he was going to be a voice to a people
[1:09:19] that would be taken in Babylon
[1:09:23] he was going to be a voice to a people
[1:09:26] that were already in crisis I know
[1:09:36] sometimes it looks like it's just hard I
[1:09:43] mean to to kind of ignore everything
[1:09:45] that is happening out there I think the
[1:09:47] right thing to do is to get the right
[1:09:50] prospective the way you can be able to
[1:09:52] line your mind to be able to deal with
[1:09:54] the attacks and the different things
[1:09:56] that is coming through the society you
[1:09:58] have to see it
[1:09:59] that is a spirit of the age what are you
[1:10:03] like yourself in your house or I mean
[1:10:05] you stayed away from it's a spirit that
[1:10:08] is that is it want to a want to rip
[1:10:10] everyone they want to a want to get
[1:10:13] every life can you remember the days
[1:10:18] were there were no cell phones and no
[1:10:20] computer and people will only turn on
[1:10:23] Christian radio station just to get away
[1:10:29] from the politics and get away from
[1:10:30] everything they would say okay I would
[1:10:33] get into your house there's no way you
[1:10:35] run away from this but we have to look
[1:10:43] at the spirit of the age and yeah yeah
[1:10:48] are we in this age and God is requiring
[1:10:52] us to bring forth the manifestation of
[1:10:55] the sons of God how are we going to do
[1:10:57] it until we get back on our knees and
[1:10:59] start prayer meeting in our home and
[1:11:01] start crying to God to give us a real
[1:11:05] prayer life until we get back on our
[1:11:10] knees praise the Lord no man is born and
[1:11:18] he's just born in his stand-up we all
[1:11:20] start on our knees crying let's go back
[1:11:23] to our knees and start crying for there
[1:11:25] for us to write list and we got a right
[1:11:27] leg crawl we got to use our knees right
[1:11:31] lay for us to be able to stand
[1:11:35] if we were brief for the manifestation
[1:11:39] of the sons of God we will be son and
[1:11:41] daughters of God to be able to stand in
[1:11:44] this age and have the right attitude to
[1:11:47] deal with all the complex and everything
[1:11:50] that is out there I mean we got to brand
[1:11:52] ourselves in prayer I had better Badham
[1:11:57] said the other day if Jesus how to pray
[1:12:00] and thusly how much you and myself and
[1:12:05] man never been more wrong he was staring
[1:12:08] right in the eyes of his creation all he
[1:12:14] did was to heal their sick was to save
[1:12:17] their lost but yet they hated him
[1:12:20] without cause if Jesus was not praying
[1:12:24] people he was wearing a cysteine element
[1:12:27] body this F this bother who have creates
[1:12:30] a lot of complex in him but he had to
[1:12:33] subject this flesh to pray he get left
[1:12:36] the disciples when the Bible said in the
[1:12:38] early time of the morning he will raise
[1:12:40] up and prayed he would get up and pray
[1:12:43] he will leave his disciple you will find
[1:12:45] a time in the mountain go across the
[1:12:47] lake be alone concentrate himself
[1:12:50] because he needed to keep this flesh in
[1:12:54] subjection to what he was called to do
[1:13:01] and I believe that is the only way we
[1:13:04] can bring forth the manifestation of the
[1:13:06] sons of God that's talking to her
[1:13:13] brother good brother he called me and
[1:13:15] talking from one thing to another
[1:13:17] anything and I quickly saw the street he
[1:13:20] was going to get us and no I'm not going
[1:13:22] on that Street brother and I just
[1:13:24] started telling us hello bruh you have
[1:13:25] to look at this thing
[1:13:27] that is a spirit that we are dealing
[1:13:28] with if we don't look at this thing the
[1:13:33] right way it would come right in our
[1:13:35] home and we go to bear with us and wake
[1:13:37] up with us on the same bed
[1:13:45] so yeah thank you for you know I like
[1:13:48] the way you are looking at it I said
[1:13:49] well I hope God keeping this way because
[1:13:53] it's a spirit it's a spirit
[1:13:59] if you don't die yourself about it you
[1:14:02] wake up in the morning you are angry you
[1:14:03] don't know why you are angry because a
[1:14:05] spirit went to you and went went to bear
[1:14:07] with you and it woke up with you right
[1:14:09] on your bed and you have no reason to be
[1:14:17] angry with your wife you don't have no
[1:14:18] reason to be angry with your children
[1:14:20] it's all because you went to bed with an
[1:14:22] angry spirit and you woke up with an
[1:14:24] angry spirit because you were just
[1:14:25] feeding your mind with the things from
[1:14:27] the media instead of meditating on God's
[1:14:29] Word and putting your spirit before God
[1:14:32] and say God help me I want to be a son
[1:14:35] of God the scripture said by one blood
[1:14:39] God save all man that's what we are Carl
[1:14:44] toe that's what we are dealing with my
[1:14:56] to conquer 19 sister 56 where Benham
[1:15:00] says he was despised and rejected
[1:15:02] there was no beauty we should desire of
[1:15:06] him he was mine above every man he was
[1:15:12] probably a little skinny looking further
[1:15:17] dealing look like the king many times
[1:15:20] the people George people by the way the
[1:15:23] dress or by the estatua man is not
[1:15:26] George by how big he is or how strong
[1:15:29] his mother his muscles and man is George
[1:15:33] by character and character alone that's
[1:15:38] what a man is it's a representation
[1:15:45] that's why Paul in Ephesians chapter 5
[1:15:48] he says the man like Christ
[1:15:50] the woman like the church that was what
[1:15:53] God was expressing from the beginning
[1:15:57] for her
[1:15:58] a family where he can express himself
[1:16:00] true to have a man where he can express
[1:16:05] his character true as a man as a father
[1:16:08] as a husband have a woman with where he
[1:16:11] can be able to express I'll shut that
[1:16:14] true a woman that can be a breast of one
[1:16:17] a one that can be a half of compassion
[1:16:22] he says a mother may forget her second
[1:16:26] child but I the law will never forget
[1:16:29] you
[1:16:31] he want to find a being where he can be
[1:16:34] able to express compassion true find a
[1:16:44] man where he can be able to express
[1:16:46] right judgment rule and man is George by
[1:16:55] character and character alone I've seen
[1:16:58] man I weigh 200 pounds and then he had
[1:17:00] an ounce of man about him man man is
[1:17:04] George by character what he is in his
[1:17:09] heart what he is in his heart a heart
[1:17:14] that is willing to help
[1:17:23] and Christ was not Josh by physical
[1:17:27] strain but he was George by character
[1:17:30] and never a man ever lived like him or
[1:17:33] never a man who ever died like him never
[1:17:40] a man who was sent up on high like him
[1:17:43] because he was God and God made man in
[1:17:46] His image
[1:18:02] praise the Lord he made no repetition
[1:18:08] for himself did you have a thing about
[1:18:10] it
[1:18:11] and then I made an artificial I made a
[1:18:13] repetition and man I made a false teach
[1:18:16] made a repetition and man I made a
[1:18:19] wooden I'm made a repetition for himself
[1:18:23] but a man who made the original I the
[1:18:28] man who made the original arm made no
[1:18:31] repetition for himself he become a seven
[1:18:36] he become a seven praise the Lord that
[1:18:43] is to think
[1:18:50] and the bird Bram used a word over and
[1:18:52] over he says God made man and man made
[1:18:54] slave why because man was supposed to be
[1:18:58] a seven the creator of heaven and earth
[1:19:03] he serve us by creating the Sun to bring
[1:19:07] our slide the moon by night the trees he
[1:19:09] serve us that's the greatness greatness
[1:19:13] of a man to be a seven take the tower
[1:19:23] and web down the counter be a seven
[1:19:37] Pelayo say give me a man and a go liar
[1:19:43] in this age is saying give me a man this
[1:19:49] loud isha spirit is a go liar that is
[1:19:52] saying give me a man if you are a man

[1:23:15] God we won the healing power we want to
[1:23:17] be speaking things into existence just
[1:23:19] it all begins with that character the
[1:23:23] character of controlling your tongue and
[1:23:26] controlling your mind young people
[1:23:28] that's where it begins from their
[1:23:32] character of dealing with yourself
[1:23:41] learning as a young man to pick up your
[1:23:44] Bible in the morning nobody have to
[1:23:46] remind you because you know that you're
[1:23:50] not doing it to please your dad or

[1:30:22] hiding in his kitchen looking for the
[1:30:28] place to hide everywhere is quiet but on
[1:30:31] the backside of the desert God was
[1:30:33] preparing a man not even counting his
[1:30:38] age but preparing him by training him
[1:30:42] training him difficult trials a lie on a
[1:30:47] bed God was preparing him beating fear
[1:30:50] out of him
[1:30:58] I mean he was not playing video games it
[1:31:00] was a real stop he was out there using
[1:31:03] his hands working all the boys they just
[1:31:08] stay home now they abort Elijah I hope
[1:31:12] you are listening to me I hope you are
[1:31:13] listening to me son I'm on YouTube every
[1:31:20] one of you boys David was out there I
[1:31:31] mean he was using his hands he was
[1:31:35] learning using his hands and by using
[1:31:39] his hands he was gaining character naive
[1:31:42] ignoring what the challenge was his
[1:31:46] father never came and taught he said
[1:31:47] local ire is out there you got to start
[1:31:49] training now let's go in Jacque no but
[1:31:54] it's the common thing he was doing he
[1:31:56] was finding things to do by his hands he
[1:32:00] wake up in the morning he finds
[1:32:01] something to do something to lay his
[1:32:03] hands on and by those things he was
[1:32:09] running he was building character in him
[1:32:12] he was facing challenges trying to
[1:32:21] of problem by himself he did not know
[1:32:26] how to do it he ran and caught his dad
[1:32:27] and said then I watch you I do but he
[1:32:29] was trying that's how a man it's made by
[1:32:39] learning by learning and God was just
[1:32:47] preparing this boy oh my goodness I mean
[1:32:51] David you were just there to seeing a
[1:32:53] lion coming and taking the little sheep
[1:32:55] what would he do he's turned this
[1:32:57] waiting and he try what was in his hands
[1:33:00] and because God was trimming him God had
[1:33:03] to bless his effort he tried and he
[1:33:07] killed a lion he felt proud of himself
[1:33:10] he have done something even though
[1:33:13] nobody would believe him but he knew
[1:33:15] that something happening he knew he was
[1:33:19] in it I mean even if you tried and you
[1:33:24] in your dream in your dream it's not
[1:33:26] really even dream that you did something
[1:33:28] you'll be proud that you did the right
[1:33:29] thing in your dream but young men just
[1:33:36] growing to be lazy computer age and we
[1:33:43] all in our mind and a civil engineer and
[1:33:46] we're thinking about all of this thing I
[1:33:47] want to be a pilot rather learn to start
[1:33:51] cleaning the floor you be a good palette
[1:33:56] by learning those little things finding
[1:34:05] a responsibility telling yourself I'm
[1:34:07] responsible to do this finally something
[1:34:10] to do wrong Society where the man just
[1:34:19] feel or is the woman's work to do this
[1:34:21] is the woman's work to do this is the
[1:34:22] warmest work to do this and it just in
[1:34:26] that just turd in their mind
[1:34:38] that's the manifestation of the sons of
[1:34:40] God
[1:34:41] that the creation is waiting for when
[1:34:47] you can see a young man growing to be
[1:34:48] responsible
[1:34:49] a young woman growing to be responsible
[1:34:55] to learn decency I was I was selling
[1:35:06] this more last now I just I was just all
[1:35:08] over the place just have multiple things
[1:35:12] flowing through my mind I was only talk
[1:35:14] on the first principle to create to
[1:35:16] creation this morning and just a lot of
[1:35:18] things were just flying all over the
[1:35:19] place and just before I left the house
[1:35:23] and at first I said to myself oh it's a
[1:35:28] Father's Day you know I thought about
[1:35:32] this subject as well yeah that's a goof
[1:35:35] I love this message go check the
[1:35:36] calendar it's not Father's Day then I
[1:35:38] couldn't get myself out of the channel
[1:35:40] of this stuff so I just preachy but
[1:35:45] that's the warfare that is before us
[1:35:49] that is the warfare that is before us
[1:35:52] that is the things that we are dealing
[1:35:53] with that's the age that we are dealing
[1:35:55] with and look these are the very same
[1:35:58] people that we are praying to get out of
[1:36:01] that God was saved him like I've always
[1:36:08] said you know God adding to the church
[1:36:10] is how much he can trust us to be able
[1:36:15] to work with these people an age that is
[1:36:20] I mean they're a population that is all
[1:36:24] swallowed up in drugs when main thing to
[1:36:29] be a man I mean you got to be on drugs
[1:36:32] you got to be high that's why the thing
[1:36:34] of man is you got to experience that all
[1:36:38] of those young infant minds and after
[1:36:46] come out of that first experience that
[1:36:47] can never turn right again because the
[1:36:50] devil knows Genesis chapter 6 the Bible
[1:36:52] says the the mind imagination of man
[1:36:57] when he can just fall that my concept
[1:37:01] pollute the mind with Phil teenis
[1:37:05] with with with violence give me the man
[1:37:22] that's what
[1:37:23] Julio acts for and Paul says the present
[1:37:30] suffering person strive everything that
[1:37:33] we are going through can never be
[1:37:36] compared to the glory that awaits you
[1:37:40] and myself if we take stain for the word
[1:37:43] of God if we just if we just desire and
[1:37:48] longed to desire now it's looking at
[1:37:55] something in the scripture and else I
[1:37:58] was just thinking about that there are
[1:38:02] places where the Bible talks about do
[1:38:03] you know Paul when he talks about the
[1:38:06] office of a bishop he says if a man
[1:38:09] desire to be a bishop I was just looking
[1:38:13] at golly desires I was looking at in the
[1:38:16] book of Corinthians he says earnestly
[1:38:18] desire spiritual gifts you know so there
[1:38:24] are things of our desires that a man can
[1:38:30] have a desire and God can be so pleased
[1:38:33] you don't have the ability but just the
[1:38:36] desire and God can bless that desire and
[1:38:40] give you the ability just a desire
[1:38:46] earnestly desiring this thing just like
[1:38:53] Hanah
[1:38:56] she was trying to do just to be a mother
[1:39:00] Lord if you just give me a try I just
[1:39:03] want that experience I would hand him
[1:39:05] right back to you
[1:39:09] just that experience that desire burning
[1:39:13] desire you know what God did he did not
[1:39:16] want to give her a chai he said okay
[1:39:18] let's try to be him get him back I would
[1:39:21] give you your children but I've made a
[1:39:22] profit in Israel I would change the
[1:39:25] course of Israel lying I will bring them
[1:39:27] back to the Word of God
[1:39:29] back to the voice of our brain gifts
[1:39:31] back of revisions once again the people
[1:39:35] who hear from God because of the woman
[1:39:38] desire Roop says your God will be my god

[1:39:54] way not knowing what was before her God

[1:44:57] devotion for themselves but again be a
[1:44:59] special movie they are watching by
[1:45:01] series some kind of a Chinese love story
[1:45:09] when you have the greatest love story
[1:45:11] before you you can save two girls at the
[1:45:17] same time you are you are you ready to
[1:45:22] forsake everything instead of gone I
[1:45:24] mean we can go on and on and on but I'm
[1:45:28] just trying to grab us into this channel
[1:45:30] this morning what am I talking about we
[1:45:33] have a warfare before us we have a
[1:45:37] warfare physically our city went into
[1:45:40] flame that's just a physical
[1:45:46] manifestation of what is happening in
[1:45:48] the spirit of what is happening in a
[1:45:52] spirit and if we had just captured by
[1:45:56] the physical things and he just work on
[1:45:58] our flesh what what he brings to us what
[1:46:01] what what is there the fruit of the
[1:46:03] flesh when we give our flesh to it you
[1:46:06] only produce the fruit of the flesh
[1:46:08] bitterness anger you know RAF we we just
[1:46:12] so be so bitter and there we get out of
[1:46:14] our expression it's our responsibility
[1:46:22] when these things are happening
[1:46:24] pull your family together and starts to
[1:46:27] pray direct our tops don't get your mind
[1:46:29] into where all the politics and seeing
[1:46:32] young people I mean I mean it's it's
[1:46:35] your freedom you can express what you
[1:46:36] want to express you know but it's good
[1:46:39] to learn our thoughts because that giant
[1:46:46] outside they we don't have no match for
[1:46:48] him just like Ezra then I had a match
[1:46:53] for go liar
[1:46:54] we don't have no match for him
[1:46:57] but when God can bring the man Christ
[1:47:01] out of your life if he can bring that
[1:47:05] little David your little fake a little
[1:47:08] desire to do right and see the right
[1:47:10] thing and God can anoint it for you to
[1:47:15] be able to fit the deme that is out
[1:47:16] there that is what the creation is
[1:47:26] waiting for that is what the creation is
[1:47:32] waiting for lets people go crazy I
[1:47:38] talking to a friend at work people go
[1:47:42] crazy I mean talking about I just go
[1:47:45] just talk about little things I said
[1:47:47] look it is our responsibility as parents
[1:47:51] it's our responsibility because it's our
[1:47:56] children that are out there it's a sign
[1:47:59] that we are we are filling our
[1:48:02] neighborhood we are filling our
[1:48:04] community because if we were training
[1:48:08] him right in the line of God's Word
[1:48:16] creation waiting on a manifestation of
[1:48:19] the sons of God that's a great warfare
[1:48:25] between right and wrong the Word of God
[1:48:30] against the modern idea that is out
[1:48:35] there and Satan is doing his best to be
[1:48:40] said you and myself to get what
[1:48:45] besetting does it get us off course when
[1:48:52] a musical instrument is beset it's out
[1:48:54] of tune it just make noise but it's not
[1:48:57] giving the right sound and what we need
[1:49:00] we need to be told by God and a way to
[1:49:02] do it is to be tuned in prayer give us a
[1:49:15] man
[1:49:25] I mean we can get on our heart get on
[1:49:28] our knees and you starts to pray and
[1:49:31] even think about all the people out
[1:49:33] there that are hurting all the people
[1:49:35] out there you know that that are trying
[1:49:37] to make their voices to be heard and you
[1:49:39] can just cry to God oh god help them
[1:49:43] help them if you can stand in the bridge
[1:49:50] let your voice be heard in heaven let
[1:50:01] there be a voice in all the noise God
[1:50:07] can look down in your little chamber and
[1:50:10] say I'm listening to that voice he's
[1:50:13] saying God be merciful how many souls
[1:50:16] life have to be lost
[1:50:32] let's just power here
[1:51:02] we just trying to encourage our self
[1:51:10] the creation is waiting on the
[1:51:11] manifestation of the sons of God your
