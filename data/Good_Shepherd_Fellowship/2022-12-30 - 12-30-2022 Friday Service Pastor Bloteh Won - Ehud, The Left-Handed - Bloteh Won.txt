praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat and uh Joshua come on we will greet you again and that is good to have each and every one of you here tonight we know this is uh special service that we call for just a time of prayer a little bit different from our regular uh 31st night service we would have so we trust that the Lord will be able to strengthen each and every one of us tonight I really wanted to to use all the night to sing but I don't have voice praise the Lord I told Brother Harry I was so tired from the services over there in South Africa I don't have message to preach so I was just going to sing sorry I forgot mine my knee a piece I got uh I got in and then uh I realized that a at the last service over in South Africa thank you for your prayers uh keeping us in prayer I was so tired that I taught the services were ending Sunday night so I kind of uphold everything into it then they told me there was another service on Monday morning and I was supposed to fly back uh Monday evening so I just went went back to the hotel I was so tired and uh I was lying down trying to follow the service here at home and then I went into sleep I woke up I watched the last part of the service I lied down and uh I was just trying to get my myself together so I prayed and you know went back to bed I said Lord I uh I just I would just trust you for whatever would happen tomorrow and then when I got on the pulpit yeah for some reason I Was preparing myself in the morning looking over my notes and all of that and then I realized that my iPad did not have power so I was left with uh ten percent power in my upper to preacher one hour 30 minute service so when I read up to uh five percent three percent of power I realized that I just have to trust the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to be able to preach the rest of what I was going to preach but the Lord blessed the service amen and then when I got home I thought that uh I would just I would just I won't bother with my iPad I will just power it when I get home so when I get home I just took it from my bed I just power it put it in my bag and uh and kept it so uh I was you know preparing everything and then when I want to take my iPad it can it's it's power power is full but then it can turn on so I say well then I don't know what's going on but uh I just believe that we're going to have a good time tonight amen praise the Lord so I well I just thought okay I will leave it for a while so I left it all through the dead and I was kind of preparing myself and uh I got to the house and I just try to power it on it's it's coming on but it's just not turning on I said well okay uh well that uh those Electronics they are very limited amen but the holy spirit is not limited amen so we have a little thought we want to share with you tonight but before we get into that uh we just we just uh tell you that we had a we had a good good service the Lord really blessed the meeting in uh in a special way and in an extraordinary way so it was it was really really a blessing and I mean just like brother brother ajaro was sharing his testimony of him coming here uh on the weekend and everything that was happening with the weather and the flight we had a little bit of that before we left we sat down at the airport for about two three hours trying to watch and see how the weather would go for some reason the brothers got the the flight schedule a bit wrong so they were already at the airport while we were here at the airport sitting in the planes seeing if we would leave they were at the airport they were waiting for us so then uh Pastor Lockheed Anthony call and said brother one where are you I see I'm in Minneapolis says are you now on the flight yet I'm sitting on the flight brother but uh it's not going anywhere until they can be able to clear the weather and make sure that we are gone so we sat there but the Lord was able to have us to leave and we left and then we took off and go to New Jersey and then it was now another 13 hours flight so he told me he said text me and let me know when your flight take off we we're really pray for the miracle because I don't have no plan B I said well okay but I got so tired that I fell asleep and and I forgot to text him so he don't know where I'm coming and uh so when I got to Johannesburg we send him a text and let him know that we were there he didn't responded and then I call him the funny thing there he told me he says when you told me you were staying in Minneapolis I felt sick hit because I was just thinking what are we going to do after the covet and everything they never had a meeting so this meeting was going to be one of their big meetings they were going to have so the real report put time into it one of the young Brothers here uh uh erected a Convention Center that has been up to about some 4 million Reigns to put up for their meetings and for other meetings that they would like to have so there was just a lot that went into the little meeting but the law was was very very gracious you know brother Brandon says when we sacrifice he says God bless what God bless is the sacrifice amen and I believe what God will bless tonight is the sacrifice that you have made to be here it's not the preacher it's not the singer it's the sacrifice that you have placed on the altar tonight that's what God is going to bless praise the Lord so uh the order of the service tonight we will we will bring you a little word of encouragement but we will really want to spend some time in praying that's what I wanted this meeting tonight so we will pray and pray for different needs and and uh if you have a special burden prayer request that you didn't give to the victims you can write it and give it to them we'll pray for different families who pray for the church and the bride at Large and then after the prayer session we'll have some time to wash it and then also we will give time for those that want to testify of uh of God goodness grace and mercy in their lives will give you that time to come and testify and those that want to sing special will also give you that time to be able to do it so uh that that is the order of the service tonight that's why we will be doing sorry I forgot that I have this thing on my on my ear and I'm trying to speak through the Mind well yeah so uh let's stand on our faith let's turn on our faith and uh we will we were saying yeah and so let's sing that song we are together again just praising the Lord [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]

together again in one that cause yes yes something good is going to happen something good it's a store we had together it today praising the Lord Hallelujah praise the Lord let's take our Bibles praise the Lord let's go to the Book of Judges tonight I might be able to share some few things I took place during the meetings uh this gone weekend but one of the outstanding things that took place was uh and more on the field praise the Lord let's read the scripture then then we will we will Judges chapter 3 . I had this thought of mine on my heart when I was thinking about this meeting I was actually going to speak on Courage I wanted to talk on Courage how fake is is courage that's what I was going to speak on but then thinking about courage I was thinking to to actually speak from the book of judges to realize the different characters that God used during the Book of Judges and ah which of course it shows how God can use his people when they make themselves available because most of the people that God used in the Book of Judges they were not expecting that God would use them praise the Lord so I I thought about that I was I was thinking about this and then while I was reading through the Book of Judges there was of this uh the strange character that we're going to read about tonight caught my attention so when I went back and started looking at my notes that I want to use tonight I realized that I preached this message in this church 10 years ago the date says May 11. 2010 that was that was the last time I preached this particular subject not the message because there is no message that is typically preached the same but I preach on this subject 10 years ago in this church so I don't know how it's going to be tonight praise the Lord so let's read from judges chapter three I couldn't believe in myself when I went back and and look at the data I said wow uh that's that's a long time Judges chapter 3. let's read from verse 13. all like it was always said from verse 12 and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the law strengthened eglon the king of more against Israel because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord and he gathered unto him the children of armor and amalek and went and smart Israel and possess the city of palm trees and the children of Israel serve eglon the king of more 18 years and when the children of Israel cry unto the Lord the Lord raised them up a deliverer Edward the son of giram a benjamite a man left-handed so many years ago I preached on the message at who the left-handed man but we want to look at it a bit different tonight Benji married a man left-handed and by him the children of Israel sin and presented unto Eglin the king of more but Heir who made him a begum which which had two edges of a cubit length and he did try Gail it under his upon his right time and he brought the presence onto Eglin the king of more and their ground was a very fat man and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away the people that bear the presence they just by our hairs and pray tonight and then we will continue our reading Heavenly Father almighty God we We Gather here tonight precious Lord realizing oh God we have this night going into the last date of the year and so father we we just we just taught to set this time aside as a church and your people that have come together tonight no doubt they have there are many laws that are streaming into the service tonight and father also precious Lord Jesus those that travel and some have to work Lord father they're unable to be here tonight dear Lord we just want to just commit to God all of those hearts oh father that uh that are with us Lord even though their presence into the service tonight we want to ask the Lord God you will bless us together father bless us together as we want to make this time just a time of dedication Lord not after the traditional last service of the year but father a time that we just want to pull ourselves together we want to take an inventory of precious Lord and father we want to put our hearts before you want to spend this time in praying more than anything else we just want to spend a Time father recommitting ourselves rededicating ourselves to you not knowing what the coming year is bringing but we know you you hold Time and Eternity in your hands so we want to trust ourselves in your hands so father the Lord God you will just you will just bless us together Lord I pray that Lord father you have my voice tonight and also Lord bless me with strength so God father we just want to use the word create an atmosphere and encourage your people and precious father Lord you will bless us in your presence we love you we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so as uh as I said or I was saying one of the outstanding things that took place in the meetings there in South Africa on Sunday morning I taught to preach a message I preached the same message she had in a different way but I preached a message on the Rachel weeping for her children which of course was my Christmas message here but I was taking it from the place of looking at God giving his people the promise and then all of those women in the lineage of the Patriot Abraham and and in his group and how Sarah was Byron and Rachel was burying uh Rebecca was barring and they were all out of uh those uh uh Hebrew mothers but then when he came to the Gentile women we saw how Sarah had to bring Hagar in uh to help the promise uh Rachel have to bring bihal in to help the promise and they were all Gentile women you know so we talked about that thought and we will we were actually talking about why God uh what what seems like a hidden thought in God's mind when he allowed barrenness even though he promises people that there will be no Barren among them but God Allah barrenness we spoke the same year so I was talking on that uh on on a Sunday morning and now with some of the supporting churches that came for the meeting we were a little over the thousand two thousand people and uh uh some of them drove from out of time so one of the drivers that brought some of this group of people they came from Kimberling is one of the the gold mining city in South Africa and uh the pastor retired Pastor there Owen Palm asked me to greet the church and many of the other brothers so uh they they rented some buses and you know to drive the people down so uh the drivers who stay you know and wait after the meetings and take the people back so one of the drivers was hanging out in in his vehicle around the the facility so he was just sitting and trying to listen to the meeting and while I was uh you know preaching I started to talk about uh I felt uh during the preaching that almost at the end I just felt something to to um uh dedicate the last part of the service to the young people you know so I started talking about Rachel weeping for her children how if there is one crowd that is heard around the message is parents crying for their children to have the Holy Ghost you know parents crying for their children to come back and serve the Lord so I took that as a type of Rachel weeping for her children and then I started talking about uh you know how Moses got so concerned about his commission and then he forgot about the coveting and sometimes that's what happened you know we as fathers we get so concerned about paying the bills and and the needs of the home and we have to work and in order that and sometimes we we we we it's almost like an oversight is almost like it's in our blind spot and then we get consumed by there by those needs and sometimes we thought we we forsake our children and sometimes even even as as preachers you know when we want to go out and win win the whole world you know we talk a little bit about that yeah so I was dealing with that and I started talking a little bit on family life you know uh you know husband and wife and this particular driver he was telling one of the brothers where I turned out to be one of the ministers that hired him he was saying that he left Kimberling with uh with his house in trouble and he and his wife were going through you know some some home strife and they were having some confusion and they were right on the brink of a divorce and his mind was he was going to make this trip to Johannesburg or actually the uh the meeting was in Pretoria it's going to make this trip over to Pretoria and then after the meeting whatever money he was going to raise he was going to put in a divorce so uh I didn't know nothing about it and we were we were we were just we're just preaching whatever the law put on our heart I don't know what God took from that meeting and there with that man sitting in the bus as he was listening so while he came after that he told the brother he says he says he says I never told you what I was dealing with so there is no way I can believe that you told that preacher what I was dealing with because I never told you he says but everything that that man is saying on that Pope is exactly what I'm dealing with in my home he said let me tell you I came here just to raise money and end my divorce he says but I think I'm leaving from here like a brand new man I'm going to get my wife we're going to sit down and we're going to suck our problem out [Laughter] oh praise the lord well all the glory be to glory amen amen we'll bring the rest of the the testimony to you on Sunday let's get into what we want to do tonight tonight it's a serious business amen we we are denying our self-sleep and rest tonight because we we want to nail this devil down tonight amen yeah when you want to nail this devil down because we are trusting God to go into into a year of a favor and Grace and all the things that God will will bless us with praise the Lord now so just like I said there's another scripture that I want to read sorry I have my phone on the airplane mode on iPad couldn't come on so I'll use my phone tonight praise the Lord and uh are we together okay let's turn to uh First Corinthians chapter 12. First Corinthians chapter 12. that's that's another scripture that I wanted to read tonight man I'm telling you those South Africans like in their own words you know they say they can abuse preacher they really abuse my body they mean praise the Lord he really really abused my body I took five Services out of six so you know that I'm really I'm really burned out but uh we're going to trust the Lord let's let's turn into First Corinthians chapter 12. let's read from verse 23 First Corinthians chapter 12 reading from verse 23. and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable praise the Lord upon this we be so more abundant honor and our uncomplied parts have more abundant complete comeliness for our calmly paths have no need but God have tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which like that there should be no sarcasm in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another just uh yesterday and uh yes yesterday I was over at the hospital and uh in the morning there was a um I'm down in in surgery and there was one of the patients there there with everything said and done that was going to give uh their body parts for uh for to donate their body parts and what they would normally do in the hospital is there they will have a you know a kind of a parade they will parade the person through the hospital and then all the hospital staffs will just land on both sides of the wall you know when it's a way to to tell the person thank you for giving life you know because uh uh either you know they will not survive their surgery or they are in a state that they will not come out of and they have decided to give you know some of the organs for people that are in need so we were there engine that after having the meeting and then right there the uh you know we were told that they were going to have that right in the in right down in the surgery area so I it's it's it's a it's a thing that I've uh you know I've really been uh I've seen a couple of times really did not understand what it was uh in the time that I will understand it uh uh was was just around the time we were we were believing God for uh sister and uh and the amazing thing was the other I was in the hospital again when the very person that was paraded was going to be the one that uh uh you know blessed our sister with the liver so uh uh but what brings that to my mind tonight for me to say they are not to put you into a side state but what brings that to my mind is because it's one of those uncommonly parts of our body you don't see it you know you don't see the liver we don't see the heart we know we have a heart we know we have a liver we know we have those organs in our body you know uh yet with these parts of our body that we see and we pour great honor on we want a good haircut you know we yeah you know we we get to the salon to do our heading and the different things that we do with this part of our body that we do see we put a whole lot of our Honor on it you know but those are uncommonly parts of our body that's what Paul is kind of for talking about here is using the human body as a type of how the body of the church is praise the Lord so what may seem as a weak part of the body God greatly esteem it amen in the very same chapter here Paul will let us know that God you know uh the weak part of the body is very necessary to God so if there is if there is one that is state is that is still struggling in faith and uh you know having having you know uh things that they are dealing with in their life you are you are very much necessary praise the Lord because I'm telling you if we all were perfect we would not have to be here praise the Lord there will be a rapture we will be gone the reason why there is a church on Earth is to be able to have the weak ones brother Brown said that was the reason why the the the the Ted pool was giving he said the temple was giving for the weak ones praise the Lord so I mean you strong ones you are already raptured you are in the Rapture you know you get FFA we the weak ones we will hold to the temple and God will bring us through praise the Lord so I want to talk about a character tonight I want to talk about a character lately when I was standing on this character that we just read about in uh Judges chapter 3. there was a portion there that kind of blew my mind and uh and that's what I want to bring to you tonight so I pray that the Lord will will just bless the thought amen I pray that the Lord will just Bless The Talk The Bible says over here in uh Judges chapter 3 verse 15 but when the children of Israel cry unto the Lord I wish we would do the same tonight we live for our voice and cry unto the Lord amen the Lord raised up a deliverer and hold the son of jira and Benjamin a man left handed praise the Lord a man left-handed now I was reading something here in my notes if uh if the our sisters will be able to to help us uh back there let me let me get it here but bam says in the message why Christ speak he said many times when you look at the scripture in our own way of looking it seems very hard but if we but if if we study it a little while we will find out that the all-wise God knows just what he's doing amen and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with men he knows what he meant he knows him we done he we only know from the intellectual standpoint amen the intellectual side he knows what really in a man praise the Lord so when we look at this read the scripture you know and local in our own way sometimes it's hard and then uh uh when that when I read the scripture back before or speak on this subject uh a brother one time uh uh I took the thoughts from my brother one time he was saying you know God was so mindful of us in this age that he give brother Brandon the salmon based on left-handedness because brother Brandon preached a message letting off the pressure because of a well-be gun that was given to Billy Paul and the gun was a left-handed gun praise the Lord so brother Brian was going to refurbish the gun rebuild the gun to to be a right-handed gun so he can he can be able to use it to to hunt and it makes the gun to blow off there was so much pressure that was put in the gum that it blew up so it was from there that brother Branham preached a message letting off the pressure so this brother was saying that God was so mindful of left-handed people that he had to create a situation with a well a big gun for brother Brandon to preach a message just from that standpoint so that that got stuck in my mind and I realized there was somewhere in the Bible that he talks about left-handed so I said well I'll go on the hunt and build a message at that time but this time it's a little bit different because when you study the scripture and you go back into the history of this he was now on it left-handed but he was handicapped he was now only left-handed but he was handicapped and that is and that is the part of the the scripture that counted for that kind of blew my mind and it's and you if you also runs through the message you realize that Broadband never preached on this character he never preached on the character so you're not going to find a quote what better brand use this character but we're going to read a few quotes tonight that will still keep us in the context of the message amen I will still keep us in the context of the message what's strange enough is that when you come down to the end of the tear chapter the last verse in the third chapter which of course it was only one verse one verse in the Bible about this God shame God that's the one that brother Brown mentioned but Brown speaks few things uh through the message about shame God but he did not mention anything about uh uh uh at home so we want to trust the Holy Spirit tonight and and look into this we want to look into it a little bit if you remember while we were talking about uh the harmony between the father and the son when I was dealing with uh David and Saul I mentioned something about uh uh sword and Saul was a benjamite and there was something unique about the benjamites the benjamites in the Bible the Bible says that they were left-handed the Bible mentioned that the Benjamin were left-handed but it it turned out to be that they were either left-handed or they were Ambi ambidextrous they could use both hands you know there was something that was very very uh peculiar with the benjamites they were they were they were they were there were men that were also very skilled in using the ball praise the Lord the benjamites were very very skilled using the board praise the Lord so uh you we will realize that uh uh and and and just before I came uh as as I was home in and I was looking through this there is there's there's another part of uh my notes that uh I couldn't I couldn't Trace back up in my icon I did a a kind of a research on on left-handed many years ago when I was studying this there are a few uh a few of the word uh percentage of people that are left-handed and uh so I decided to just go back in and uh and just make some few few research uh you know on on we will not go into the science of of all of that tonight but it is just it is proving that uh there is there is certain skill set that comes with the left-handed people proving that you know certain skill set that comes to them and uh uh you I mean you can see a big part of that in sports uh those that were left-handed uh became one of the world's best boxer tennis player and even in all line of sports they have they have a certain skill set even though they are it's very small group of people that uh that are left-handed and I mean there is there is just a lot of signs a lot of reasoning around the whole left-handed thing but we will not will not make that you know a kind of a big issue tonight we just want to go and and go right into the inspiration of what God was doing here praise the Lord I want to go right into the inspiration of what the Lord was doing and why and what he want to grab our attention on so uh let's look I think there's a scripture here that really brings there out let's look in first Chronicles chapter 12. let's look in first Chronicle chapter 12. first Chronicle chapter 12 we'll read from verse 1 now these a day that came to David why he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Keith and they were among the Mighty Men helpers of the war they were armed with boats they could use both the right hand and the left hand hurting stones and shooting arrows out of the ball even of sore brethrens the benjamites praise the Lord so it was something that was uh that was very you know that was very peculiar of the benjamites you know they were they were they were you know uh I think also if you look in George's chapter 20 you know it's also mentioned there uh about these men's you know being being left-handed but yeah the Bible says they were using both left hand and right hand and uh they were they were they were Hollows of stones and that that that uh I mean that that mean how how they control you know how they could throw their stones and they were also people that were good in shooting bow and arrow if you remember David told journey to and he says I think uh your father David have an ought against me Johnny don't say how how I mean why would my dad want is looking for your life David said let's not make an argument argument about it but I would not be at the feast tonight you go to the feast and you just tell you know look at the the atmosphere when it is truth should mean an arrow you know and David told journey to where he will be you know so Jonathan Wayne sat at the face and and uh Saul realized that David was not there he got angry journey to knew that what David was saying was it was true he came out he took his board he was able to shoot for it to learn exactly to where David was so that was just how you know that that was how these Benjamins were they were very good people that could that could shoot the ball amen I wanna that's not why God took the first is Messenger to be a Vegemite Paul was a benjamite remember he was saw he was a benjamite so he could he could also shoot shoot the arrow of the word amen praise the Lord he could also shoot the arrow of the word I'm trying to kind of for uh uh deal with my nervousness tonight uh yeah there were some things that I laid in my notes I can ask us tonight so I'm just trying to you know free myself from from my own trouble praise the Lord and uh like I said I was thinking on speaking on Courage to look up the different men that God used in the Book of Judges you can you can think about it uh you know the book judges out of out of the the Hebrew the the book actually means deliver is speaking about people that God raised at a setting point of time to deliver his people it's not George is in a sense of in a way that we will understand judges in in the English sense but it means that God raised these men up and uh and and after they deliver the people they judge them they'll the the you know the rule over them for the period of time until you know the people went back into their problem but uh just like I said if you look through the scripture and you you read the Book of Judges you see the character of the other people that God used in this kind of a situation there is one thing that was that was uh uh outstanding in this book when you read the Bible says there was no prophet so every man bit what was right in their own eyes praise the Lord now uh I mean with the age and time that we are living and we can we can compare that and says well we are almost in this in the same uh state of time where everybody is doing you know what is right in their own eyes but it should not be the same with you and myself praise the Lord because we don't have a prophet as a man here we fast but we are following the prophet message praise the Lord so we must never be able to uh uh just do the things that we think is right in our eyes the reason why God sent us a prophet is to give us instruction how to do things because if it is just left with us I mean we will do things uh uh and sometimes those things that we would do they would be to our own hurt you know so that's one of the things that stands out in the Book of Judges but with the character of this man if you if you follow the reading and you you realize that uh the Bible says when he was going down to the king of Moab he took a digger now he placed it on his right side and what actually he did was he put it in a way that it looks like a right hand foreign you think about it he's going toward the king of more the people that is ruling over them for 18 years praise the Lord amen you know that in the day of the Soul when man fought with swore uh if a man was right-handed he put his sword on his left side because that was the way he would take it out and then he will fight so he put the Digger on his right side but I believe he did it in such a way that he could put his Rob on it now he was going to meet the leader of the Moab you think about it picture it in your mind the least mistake that the armies the God and the people around the king will realize that this man had a weapon praise the Lord so just put it in the context of a picture in your mind the least mistake that he they will they will detect that he had a weapon on him that was going to cause his life praise the Lord my brother Branham says something here total Deliverance he said when God sent a man to do anything God completely equipped him with everything that he has need off praise the Lord praise the Lord you think about it now when you think about God equipping a man it's easier for us to think about giving him you know uh uh all the the physical ability and giving him all the but what I want to bring to to you uh uh uh this evening is there in uh money even made clear by prophecy but Abraham says that God designed his man he gave them their nature he gave them their nature the very nature that they have he also gave them the attendance saying he placed certain weaknesses in their lives that he God is going to use a man here whichever way that he became handicapped that uh you know uh the history would say actually in in Hebrew the brother are very beautiful whichever way whether it was by accident or he was born that way but yet it was a way that God designed him to be equipped if he had two Flying Hands like you and myself where was he going to hide that digger I'm sure God was was going to use some other way to inspire him to be able to bring Deliverance to his people so when God sent a man he equipped the man the way that we think of a man being equipped that's not the same way that God thinks praise the Lord do you see why Paul here in the book of Corinthians is encouraging us to realize that the uncommonly parts of our body are very important the reason why God will allow us we've been dealing with that here for a while the reason why he will allow things in our life and and uh you know uh that the things that will keep us on our knees things that will make us humble it is God's design he knows what we are made out of he knows exactly what to set us to bring us to perfection Paul says he poured this tone in my flesh Paul testified to it that if I've been not hard to deal with this ice problem maybe I would have exalted myself above all the brethrens he says but God gave me this problem that keep buffing me it keeps bothering me and I prayed about it and I prayed he says and the Lord says Paul my grace is sufficient and my strength is made perfect in the weakness that I place in your body praise the Lord every time you come to that weakest spot that's when you need me the most praise the Lord so it's not only the word is not only the mystery that God used to equip us he also used our nature he used the way we are made praise the Lord when God sent a man to do anything I don't know what God sent you to do but you think about it he completely equipped him with everything that he has need of if God called a man to be a preacher he puts something in him to preach with if he call him to be a teacher he puts something in him to teach with if he call him to be a prophet he puts something in him to see visions and to be a prophet God always com completely equate his man and that's just what he's done when he sent Moses to Egypt and I will also say that's what he's he's doing right here when he sent this uh uh there who over there to iglam over tomorrow to bring Deliverance to his people you know uh uh you know the story there over in uh uh how you call it now the same judges of of Jeff Ty how he was rejected now so you see here that this man in the state that he was I don't believe that Israel who have ever taught that this is the kind of a man that we want to be our judge just like they could not think that Jeff time because he was now born of a mother that was Hebrew that kicked him out of the camp but that was just the man that was fit for the job praise the Lord you know where I'm trying to travel tonight I'm trying to travel in the area of your weaknesses I want to exploit your weaknesses tonight praise the Lord amen because you see that is it is those uncommonly parts that we cover praise the Lord amen because we think that they are not necessary we all love to talk about you know how I read a message in the Revelation that I get we don't talk about our weaknesses so often we also we always cover them because we think they are shameful we think that uh you know when we start talking about it people might think you know we're not really a Believer but that's the place I want to travel tonight that's the place I want to travel tonight because I believe that every one of us do it in those areas sometimes amen and that's the place I want us to travel tonight and hoping that God will be able to to uh to bless us you will be able to give us even for the grace and because it is it is is the it's the most place that Satan also likes to deal with us he likes to remind us of those weaknesses because he feels like every time he goes in those areas and bring those things to our mind and we weaken our faith and we condemn us it would trouble us praise the Lord Hallelujah amen so I pray that the Lord will be able to help us tonight amen praise the Lord brother Branham says as he continuing here in total Deliverance then just like if you are a Christian God Don't Make Any Halfway Christian God make a complete Christian he God Don't Make a halfway preacher but a preacher can be halfway and God make his children Christians but sometimes they are halfway Christians but it's not God's intention for them to be that way in their own ways God makes up with the plan of God for their lives and that's what makes them the way they are God don't want them to be half with Christians or have with preachers compromising on every side or he want them to be completely standing in the bridge praise the Lord he want us to be completely standing in the bridge Hallelujah amen praise the Lord now so we see here that uh this is this is all God's doing you know it's it's all he's doing is uh uh the prophet of God also speak here in spiritual adoption he says the tutor always point the child to the father and to have him to to believe the father and then the teacher was a trainer this morning as I was looking I have my dear little company I see my little son when he you know he troll his little tantrum at the table in that Broadband is going to talk about here there uh how media trying to correct Joseph and it's also in the use of him yet I realized where this is going uh he's going to talk here in the use of hand you're trying to me they're trying to choose uh train Joseph in using his right hand and now using his left hand but what I want to take here in in this talk is is the place of tutorship Birmingham taught us how in adoption the father will always get a tutor for his children and the reason why the father we get the tutor is because he want the child to get to the place where they can be able to appreciate their inheritance he is also teaching the child the different things what the father desire is but it's all about the inheritance it's all about what what the father had given to us and uh and I believe that is the place where we are you have to remember things so brother Brown says we are going we are going to go into uh dark times we are facing Troubled Waters and and the different things that is happening uh around the world around the message around the Christian faith and the hour that we are living in so it's very important for us Sons and Daughters of God to be able to understand what what is the Father's mind concerning us praise the Lord the different things that we go through the different things that we deal with how do God looks at them the struggle that we go through praise the Lord because I'm telling you if you keep listening to the devil the devil is never going to tell you anything positive about what you are dealing with praise the Lord but God said in his word I know the thoughts that I think towards you and my thoughts is to bring you to unexpected end so no matter what we are going through no matter where we are dealing with in our life we have to understand that God is part of God's design to be able to bring us to the place that he wants us to be it is not there to give us a setback it is not there that whenever we get in this area of weakness or get in this area of Temptation then it becomes a setback oh I don't have the Holy Ghost oh I'm not a child of God praise the Lord but I think it's more out of place of word God wants to grab our attention and they are just like I said over and over he has brought us into a partnership and many times are we you know we believe the Bible says repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so sometimes they have always been taught that when we go down to the water then we are baptized all the the sinful nature leaves under the water no that's just a symbol all right that is just a symbol those those sticky nature they are stay there in our hearts and in our mind but when we come out of the water understanding that now is the time where God wants for you and him to be a partner to deal with those things one at a time whether he will expose it by the word of God all you would discover that this is an area that I need need God praise the Lord but you know what I've happened many of the times we think that those things will spiritually goes away we expect them to disappear oh yeah sometimes they will sometimes God will deliver them Deliver Us from them but sometimes they have some things that he want our hands on deck praise the Lord he want us to be able to identify it he wants us or to have such an anger against this thing praise the Lord he want for us to deal with faith most especially just like the turn of Israel they're over in the promised land there uh uh uh Judges chapter one The Bible says that because you have compromised these uh people of the land are going to be torns in your sign God told them to get rid of it those things that we compromise with those things that afternoon the knowledge of the truth we get ourselves in sometimes they just don't go away right we don't have these uh uh Supernatural night over over flying nothing you know and because sometimes you come to the meeting and and the presence of God will be so strong you enjoy the service you know you lift your hands also you wait you feel that sweetness around you and and you know you you could have the mind that I believe that God will deliver me praise the Lord then after a week or two you realize that that thing stays start creeping on you you don't start smelling it or you start feeling it not if you don't understand the principle of redemption that God told the children of Israel he says I have given the land to you amen he says I will send Muhammad to push them back he says I will drive them off the land he and he also tell them you have to fight for every inch of ground praise the Lord so you can't sit back and say God you said you will deliver them you were you would give us the land it's the land flowing we're milking only yes it is he said you were pushed back then yes God will push back the enemy but he also said you should fight for every inch of ground praise the Lord how God is going to use what seems to be like a disability praise the Lord maybe this young man coming up people might have laughed at him he might have had a lot of people that are you know bother him teasing or they are even if there was nobody teasing him sometimes you have that complex because it looks like you are different from everybody so you deal with that mental complexion his age is not mentioned but there is enough years of Oppression year 18 years 18 years that is an age of a teenage boy so if we just say for that example to think in our mind that from the time he was born he was honored the suppression of the moabites that's all he saw he saw the air farmer the Harvest being being taken away from them he saw how these moabites were coming to their town if he had a sister or he had a cursing or how the the girls in their place was ravaged just a sense of suppression that he dealt with for 18 years I wonder what was going on in his mind praise the Lord I wonder what was going on in his mind maybe that Ezra had an army or they just had a little group of men that were coming together and talking about Deliverance maybe he never felt like he could fit among them maybe he'd get him on there and he just said hey you go just go home go and stay home stay beside your mama we don't want anybody to hurt you you're already dealing with a whole lot praise the Lord but you see yet in his state of weakness there was something that was building in his heart and what is that courage courage is is uh is an unconscious faith because brother Branham said faith is unconscious praise the Lord he says faith is unconscious what we call we have faith he says it's on a conscious level and many times when they are faith we think we have is put to the test we fail and because it's on a conscious level is limited he says by the time faith is really expressed it comes from a subconscious moment where the person is just overtaking and like like like like I would just pick up and the Bible says he killed how many men whether it was in One bank or more than one day it comes from a subconscious place and I believe that's that's where courage comes from when a person take courage courage don't comes from reason well we reason in our mind and we calculate and you know and yeah and we make plans and and all of that you know uh you know how much it would cost meaning how many time I can put in it and all of that you can make all of those planes I don't know whether you have been there I've been in that place you make all of those planes it looks so beautiful in your mind but yet you don't have the strength to carry it out when you are just by yourself you are living it in your head to be able to bring it out there is no strength a man in the Bible that I've had courage that will courageous to do things they came from a very subconscious place I hope there are some things that I could I could read to you tonight on that uh but uh technology is failing me I was speaking a little bit on that this this uh weekend there uh uh in South Africa I was my first service the brother that opened the meeting he preached on the message uh caused faith that this word is not worthy of so I thought okay I would come behind him with a message of faith and I trusted the Lord and uh but I was I was actually talking from a place where signs has been able it's it's a kind of a big Discovery what they did was that they took they as they took the Titanic and and the and the earthwork that destroyed the Titanic because the Titanic had five levels so the five levels of the Titanic they're locking there to our five senses praise the Lord and and what they did also is that they were able to to to to see their when the ship was was heading out to the Sea there was a little portion of the iceberg that was on top of the water the one that was floating on top of the water but what the the captain of the ship or the engineers of the ship did not realize there there was a a huge peace of their asper because what happened is that the ship was built in such a way that if if the lower level is scratched they could stay still and they could live on the rest of the full level if the fourth level of the ship was hit they could all gather on the fifth floor and the ship will stay still but what the iceberg did is that it hit it in a way they hit it just like this it never hit it like this so all five level of the ship was hit so there was no level that was left for survival and it was all because they either underestimated how that Iceberg was so science is comparing that now with us and they are trying to let us know that with what we see with our five senses and what we are conscious to this is science telling us this is something brother Brandon told us since 1955. I wish I could I read the quotes here to you tonight now science is now discovering that that uh uh uh the things that we see with our natural eyes that we are conscious to they are making us to realize that uh uh we we our our Consciousness is very limited and most of our live action and reaction is driving from our subconscious level the way we react to things is all driving from our subconscious level it's from that subconscious level we make decisions and we react to things there are sometimes help us to move on or sometimes makes us to fail praise the Lord amen so you will realize as we are sitting here tonight and as a Son of God as a daughter of God you've been hearing the word and the word being preached to you and and you know sometimes you enjoy the preaching of the word sometimes you struggle to be able to see where the word is going and all of that but you will see just like even you look at brother Brandon Ministry let me just bring that in a little bit here you look at brother Brandon Ministry you will realize that in in in in in in in in most of the time brother Branham honored the gift and he's dealing with people they are like he said he says I live most of my life in another room that the word knows nothing about so brother Branham the the preaching of the word goes mostly for our subconscious state then our conscious state sometimes the preacher will say something that will grab your attention you would dwell on that and you will go on preaching but you will just be captured in that thought praise the Lord and that is the same way courage is something that comes from in our subconscious state now if a person has been to the place word they I mean they're being bullied they've been rejected and you know no one tried to see their area of strain and encourage them a little bit they can have beautiful I mean wonderful ideas in their mind praise the Lord they are thinking about this they are thinking about this but yet they don't have the courage to be able to express it I wonder if I say this they will yell at me again I wonder if I try this I will be accepted sometimes people go through different things in their lives whenever the brands also said that he says when we deal with things and we don't deal with it rightly whether it's a mistake in our lives or is wrong that we have done he talks about that woman that was caught in adultery where her husband was on went for war he says uh because she never did there with her rightly he said it just went and sat down in her subconscious reign that's why it was running her mad every time she see that nobody is coming she was reacting to what was sitting down in her subconscious area praise the Lord so whether on the positive side or on the negative side so what might have been going through the mind of our character tonight what was he thinking about 18 years now my question to you tonight before we go into praying all of the things that you have seen around the message the one that you can call the good things the one you can call the bad things as you go on and on what have you been thinking what how how how are those things being chattering your faith how are they been dealing with you as your local things if you are in this assembly you look at things around the assembly you look at the church and all of that just let me just keep it home here you know what are the things that are going through your mind you everything we about to close another year all the messages that are being preached which direction are we going where as a church are we going where where I mean where do we find ourselves also there are areas where we can we can claim some victory we can thank God for this service we have this preacher came or he preached a wonderful message it was a Revival we enjoyed but what about all the things that have been happening praise the Lord possible other things that have been happening how are you channeling all the things that you see around your individual life how are you channeling it says sinking your shape or is it building strength in you for you to be able to deal with the King of England is it is it it said creating strength is it is inspiring you are you grabbing some inspiration because I believe it was not just one Bank that air who designed that digger that he will be able to go he reached to the gate greet the people and says I have a present for the king and then everybody and everybody no one thought that he had a digger that he was going to to kill their King and and take over them I don't think it was just one night service for all the 18 years of Oppression he was channeling the beating he was channeling the crying he would hear in the city the rape he will see the destruction that the moabits will come and take their things all of those things he was chattering it and it was it was for him it was building from strength to strength from strength to strength he was saying Lord how we going to come out of this Lord what can I do to deliver my mothers and my brothers one contribution can I make to change what is taking place in this place seeing all of those things that's what was coming to his mind goes to bed the best blanket and put it over his head he's thinking in his mind what can I do what can I do I might not live till tomorrow if the enemy come upon us tonight Lord what can I do to deliver this house what can I do to become an impact what can I do to strengthen the brother or to strengthena sister Lord if this is the place you have called me to self if this little group is where you have called me to self to be part of this body what can I do to make it better he goes to bed and that's what he's going through his mind that's what is going through his mind he's thinking thinking about it thinking about it even though it seems like he's handicapped it seems like he's left-handed even to the Jewish mind left hand there was something completely different if we just take it in light of the way the scripture says he's left-handed even to the Jewish mind that alone is something completely different what can I do courage praise the Lord even though we know that something had a seven laws but a lot of the things that he did it was from Courage and just like something we can do the same because we have a God that promised he will never leave us he will never forsake us we have an unfailing promised world with us God says as the mountain is surrounded Jerusalem so the Lord is about his people we have used some of our Petty situation to reduce our God to nothing some of our petty situations we have made those situations to Cloud our mind we are bury our faith honor those situations praise the Lord and then it seems like our God is going far away from us when Paul said the lord it's 90 even in the mouth and thou We Believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that's what the scripture says Romans chapter 10. courage all of those deliverers that rose up in the Book of Judges it was courage they came out of Courage because they can no longer bid the suppression they can no longer bid the things that was keeping them from enjoying the land that was flooring with milk and honey the blessings that God has given to them they could no longer enjoy it because of fear doubt and all of that but when they respond told their subconscious faith of Courage they were able to step out they were able to they were able to break themselves praise the Lord oh I hope that this coming year will be a year of Courage for you I hope the coming year would be a year that you would you you'll be able to get some courage and you'll be able to step out as a Son of God and as a daughter of God and bring some of those situations under control because you have what it takes you have what it takes brother Brown says why the church needs it already have it he says that faith is lying dominant it's lying there we we're making no use of it we are allowing Petty things he says we'll make the mouth to speak when Aaron says Moses says I can't speak who make the mouth to speak my question would be who gave us the nature we have whether it is temper whether it is lying tongue water it is uh uh uh you know my battle Lost full speed whatever it is we'll make this body I can't I just cannot put him put it right praise the Lord who make this body that just came for the right if he promised to take out a Stony heart is he a lying tongue that he can take away we just need courage we just need courage and I think that's one of the things that have gone away from the church that's one of the things that have gone away from the Christian church when it used to be were the the old fathers and and all believers would come together and people will grow courage to be able to share their weaknesses church pray for me I've been going through this the devil being bothering me through this that courage has gone from the church praise the Lord we are all wearing the max and every song that we try to make the max up we're masking ourself I don't have the courage to say Lord I need more of God I need the Holy Ghost I need God to deliver me from this habit that's just courage praise the Lord oh but we are so we are so we have just power the complex and what people will think and what people will say and what people would do that is so hard for us to find a man of Christ every character through the book is courage praise the Lord it's just gone just like I was sharing with you after a meeting we we shot down and you know the brothers were going through the different things and talking about you know how how we have failed in some areas is because even to get the courage and said you know the young people down our children down and tell them the things that we deal with right the struggle that we had things that we deal with because uh uh you know they always see the leaders and parents and and fathers like strong men they don't know how to deal with weaknesses because the interpretation there is that I never seen my father crying so I'm not supposed to cry I'm not supposed to cry it's not meant to cry it's not a man to say sorry come on now yep and if they don't see you doing it they will just think that it's not supposed to be sold there's not supposed to be so children learn from example most of the things that we learn from is the thing that we capture we see it we we suck it in like sponge what are some of the things they are teaching us don't do this don't do this it just go over your head as they are saying as you're shaking your head you're dropping it to the ground yes yes yes you just throwing it down but once you learn is the ones that you see can It capture your mind it goes straight down in your subconscious it's still there that's the reason why Paul said these things were for your examples the things you see in the scriptures they were for your example because we don't see those things they are no longer in church they are no longer in church and what you don't realize we don't realize is that we are killing the children in that way we are not inspiring them we are not inspiring them they don't see anything to follow after all they see is that we come to church we sit in our seats praise the Lord we sit there we you know we we just you know follow the service say amen and all that courage courage praise the Lord I pray that God will give us some courage tonight praise the Lord I even coming out here this evening would just now be uh another dry religious evening where we will have the courage to be able to break some grounds we have the courage to be able to pour out our hearts tonight in you know and really be able to spend some time with the Lord you know and and just put our house out because I realized that we will have the service on on Saturday I mean I can keep you Saturday night and and I expect you to come Sunday morning again for church I mean that would that would just stress you out so uh or as we'll just have the service you know let's just sing let's just pray that's nice 12 o'clock we pray and go home because we got to come back to church on uh uh uh on Sunday morning but I wanted for us to come together tonight praise the Lord and just and just try to become sparring partners tonight you know what sparring partners are is uh it's almost like the you know the boxer he has a sparring partner when he gets in the ring with him they just don't joke even though they are training but but they hit one another high barbam says that's the reason that's the way that Smith was the second Smith the one that trained him in boxing the prophet of God said when he gets in the ring with that man the man will will punish him so much until he will go over the rink he thought that the man hated him preparing him to be the champion that he was praise the Lord to be the champion that he was the Lord was so good to us he kept us his grace and his Mercy was Richmond to us even as a church as a people we can be grateful to the Lord but you see we just can't continue this way we can't continue this way because memorials are very important all through the scripture you will see God left memorial for his people he said when you're going across Jordan gather those stones tomorrow when your children ask you what is the meaning of those stones you can tell them the Lord brought us through their water we cross on dry Lane and We Gather the stones there Memorial is very important praise the Lord I pray that the Lord will give us a Time tested Memorial tonight amen you gave us a Time testing Memorial I mean there are things we deal with in our lives and and uh you know all that uh the Lokes unbearable and looks uh I mean we sometimes we get tired we get frustrated about about of these things and you know the way that uh uh but sometimes you gotta you gotta step back a little bit I mean if it's if it is yourself you know a scene driven habit you just need a holy ghost to burn it right you know if it's the same driven habit you just need the Holy Ghost to burn it that's all you need with that but I mean uh when I'm talking about uh areas that it looks like we are somehow weak we are somehow vulnerable in all of that you know it looks like uh you know we can make out our mind on some on some pain so where we are at all the devil is keep troubling us about whether you have the Holy Ghost or you don't have the Holy Ghost and then sometimes you got to look at those things in your life he says Lord I don't understand what's happening I've been watching this pattern in my life it just looks like this thing come around after every couple of weeks or a couple of months praise the Lord and I believe that's what the hell who was doing he was thinking How can I how can I make a difference whatever I can do Lord even if it will cost my life can you imagine going into the enemy camp praise the Lord maybe he might have thought well I'm I'm even rejected by my people so what's what is the need let me just die I'm tired of seeing this thing so let me just go if my life with any in it let my life end you always say I have a message for the king I have a message for the king put himself in such a way very cool net suspect or detect but you see the thing that it was not it was not his craftiness it was God looking at the desire of his heart God looking at the desire of his heart wanting to do something for God offered God's people it was not his craftiness because you tell me look at the look at the description of the figure that he carried the Bible said he tied to his right time I mean in order that way I mean you are you are going into a place of of people that are trained to protect the king you mean they will not suspect you but when a man Waits pleases the Lord that's what the scripture says when a man Waits pleases the Lord I mean even as young people you know we use the word young people young people so sometimes you just get in our brain we think we are young we are young people wherever we meet young people we stay young people praise the Lord but if you realize you you found out that God never made babies when he brought the first son of God he was he was a he was a son when he expressed The First Daughter of God she was a lady ready out to carry out God's Commission praise the Lord we we've used that terminology sometimes they get in our head and we just think oh yeah we are still young people you know that's why young people deal with that's why young people you start having your children you keep dealing with it you will keep you be a young people having babies but you see the opening of the word it brings maturity why because brother Branham say it's Brian material is brown material it brings such responsibility to God's people and God's bride when you really start getting in the word I mean you really start getting in the word listening to the voice of God trying to grab God's mind not just following a religious order of listening to a message or trying to say Lord what is the spirit saying to me when you really start doing that you realize how how much maturity it will bring to you how much maturity it will bring to you the way it will impact your life it's a message to have come to get a bride ready and this word can get us ready for any situation my mind thing I want to do with you tonight just like Edward 18 years I don't know how many years she's been believing the Lord how many years God really been dealing with you how many years this message has realized that coming true to you it started becoming more personal to you and with all of the things that have happened around your life you're Uprising you're down falling your you know mistakes what have you brought to you what courage are you getting from me even with this entire year that is about to close on us all of the things that you have gone through all of the things that you have gone through when you reflect on the entire year what kind of for inspiration is it bringing to you praise the Lord you know like Bertram said we don't wait for the end of the year and start making New Year resolution no what push us in the coming year is all that we have gone through this year as we sit back and reflect on these things praise the Lord what are we drawing our courage from some of the things that we are dealing with some of the things that might have looked like uh uh discouraging moment in our lives was just God wanting you to sit down and pay attention he just wanted you to sit down and have a moment with him because since there is nothing too high for the god that we serve what situation we are dealing with in our life that God that that God can take take over if we talk about God that opened the rare seed with uh with uh pharaoh and his uh uh Horseman behind those people they are walking on their feet 40 years in the wilderness and God sustained it even their clothes then what situation we are dealing with that God cannot change praise the Lord one of our problems brother Brandon reminding us is that uh you know we are looking to God when actually God has raised us up in this hour and he's looking to you and myself we are waiting on God when God is just wanting you to put that word into action just put that word into action say Lord I know that this is your word I know this is where I'm going to stand on this word I'm going to do exactly what your word says we know right from I mean all true or all through the Book of Judges there something life brought out such a revelation that it was it was the anointing of the law that was making the difference whenever the anointing comes on him he could he could pick up again and that was the same thing with all of the people in the Book of Judges it was whenever the spirit of the Lord comes upon them God comes and blessed their courage female like Gideon how scary he was when they say when he said somebody that's a cow God God proved to him he said no I want another sign again Lord okay the woo has gone wet let it get dry you know he carried God through all of this but yet God was looking at the fear that Gideon had but yet God called him a Mighty Man of yellow so all of those characters they had an area where God's strength was made perfect they make themselves available God was able to step on this sick and use what seems to be a weak area in their life think about it tonight you will never want to take a man like that to set him as a leader but he got down there he used the deaca right through the king's stomach set him in his chair locked the door went through and he was gone the Lord gathered him watch over him protect you until he was gone and then also he grew the courage to go and call the rest of his brothers say come and see what the Lord has done courage when God take him if a weakness taking something that looks like a disability no excuse the life of excuse It's not wanted of the Gospel praise the Lord that's where my heart was tonight that's where my heart was tonight to kind of encourage you so I mean it's just it's just not to thank the Lord as we thank the Lord for his goodness we thank the Lord for his grace and his love and mercy but also what I wanted us to do is to be able to look at those areas where it looks like they are discouragement to us and we think that should have been better than this I believe that you can do better than that that's what I believe I think I should have been Above This I mean I've been I've been hanging around this mountain too long praise the Lord and all of all of my my experience around the message what uh uglet or whatever it is some people have gone through terrible terrible things sat on a wrong Ministry wrong impression and different things they have gone through but all of those things that God has taken us through yet his grace has kept us and sometimes the other things they were just that would just spring out of you says man God has been so good to me it will just spring out give you such a faith and you don't you realize it's just been lying there he just need courage just need you to be courageous praise the Lord like I've said before the early church their emphasis was on the raising Christ among them that was their emphasis their emphasis was to see the very same thing that that was in Jesus ministry to see it manifesting among them there was the emphasis of the early church I mean since I realized that they have just changed changed my my mind a little bit of the way that I look at sometimes the subject sometimes people we try to make an emphasis you know love now one time the world will spare out there in the book of Acts now that they did not love one another the Bible says they saw their things they brought it to the feet of the apostle but you see their emphasis was not just on you know uh trying to make one another feel good their emphasis was Jesus Christ living in their mess because they saw the resurrected Christ they saw him the Bible says all their eyes behold while he ascended and they they now want they never wanted that thing to leave them they wanted that image they wanted the feeling they wanted the atmosphere to stay with them all the time I pray that God will be able to give us some courage for us to be able to step out a sons of God as daughter of God we can I mean we can see things we can complain we can have an argument about how this state is not right and how this other one is not right and things must not be like that but the courage to go out and do something about it the courage to be able to step forward and do something about it the musicians can come tonight let's change the order of the service let's
