[3:43] puning away right now I throw a shell in
[3:46] it it fires there it is if it don't fire
[3:50] I won't quit I'll throw that one out of
[3:52] the thud and try another one one of
[3:55] them's going to go off that's all there
[3:56] is to it one of them's go to fire
[3:58] somewhere then I I want to be on the
[4:00] target so when it does fire I'll hit the
[4:04] object that I'm shooting at and I you
[4:05] know what I mean I'm sure they there's
[4:07] something somewhere I'm leaving for
[4:09] these meetings just plunging out on her
[4:12] I don't aim to teach these great things
[4:15] I teach you people you remember what
[4:18] that dream that I got the interpretation
[4:20] was go back and store up
[4:23] food where was The Storehouse this
[4:27] Tabernacle where is there anything like
[4:30] it in the country around here anywhere
[4:32] that will compare with the message that
[4:34] we have now of course our little
[4:35] brothers here that's out along here
[4:37] these other little churches are
[4:39] us we are one where would you go to to
[4:42] find it short it's comparison
[4:45] anywhere you go right out denominational
[4:48] Creed you'll go right out away from the
[4:49] name of the Lord Jesus you go right out
[4:51] away from these other things see here's
[4:53] where the food's been stored up well one
[4:56] message that I preach here to you all
[4:58] look I've been preaching from 1 to 6
[5:00] hours till you on a message yeah well if
[5:02] I had to use one of those message I'd
[5:04] take a week to take it just a little bit
[5:06] here and a little bit there see because
[5:08] it's been stored up here it's on tapes
[5:10] it'll go worldwide on the tapes where
[5:12] people in their houses them tapes will
[5:14] fall right into the hands of the
[5:16] predestinated of God Amen he can direct
[5:18] the word he'll direct everything just
[5:20] exactly to its course that's the reason
[5:22] he sent me back to do this store up the
[5:25] food here you forbid me to go overseas
[5:28] brother argum might said come go you got
[5:30] one night but we'll take you a tours
[5:32] trip all around over the country the way
[5:34] I seen brother Fred and brother Banks
[5:36] trying to go I said I wouldn't go that
[5:38] way see it showed that there was
[5:41] something else I pressed right up to the
[5:44] mark now but I don't know which way to
[5:46] go but the examination laying all around
[5:49] me did he call me back to the evangelism
[5:53] has he called me to foreign missionaries
[5:55] has he called me to be his Prophet I'm a
[5:58] pastor somewhere whatever I'm to do do I
[6:00] just keep throwing shell in and pulling
[6:01] a hammer on it one of them will go
[6:04] off but I'm just not going to stay and
[6:06] look say Lord you put the shell in the
[6:08] gun I'm going to put the shell in the
[6:09] gun do the pulling myself let him do the
[6:12] firing he's the one to take care of that
[6:14] let me just keep moving on when I go on
[6:17] this meetings now I'm just going out I
[6:19] don't know I may not say one thing about
[6:23] these message like a preacher I may not
[6:26] even have one night of discernment I
[6:28] don't know I'm I'm just going not
[6:30] knowing what I'm going to do I couldn't
[6:32] tell you I'm just going and that's all
[6:35] and that's what you have to
[6:37] do you have got something in mind the
[6:39] people here wants a church build it as
[6:43] quick as you can get it up get your
[6:46] teachers and things you brother not your
[6:48] little churches and you want to you're
[6:51] doing a work God will reward you for
[6:53] that go out there preach do everything
[6:56] you can that all of you get together you
[6:58] bunch of man and have meetings and talk
[7:00] on deep things of the scripture and pray
[7:04] don't don't just come here together
[7:05] unless you come for prayer meeting alone
[7:07] do your praying in secret stay out in a
[7:10] placees go into your rooms hide out
[7:12] somewhere and just kneel down and just
[7:15] stay before God and stay there then if
[7:17] you find out look like something's
[7:19] moving up or you're just going and you
[7:21] find out it gets a little bit off the
[7:23] word and be careful no matter how good
[7:27] it looks stop right there a wrong Spirit
[7:30] struck you because the message of this
[7:32] day is to the
[7:34] word don't see if you say oh my brother
[7:37] brand I tell you so and so while so and
[7:39] so stood the other night this thing take
[7:41] place like this watch
[7:42] it watch it close don't renounce nothing
[7:46] just wait and see how it acts and then
[7:49] bring it up to the word and see how it
[7:51] Compares with the word then if it
[7:52] Compares with the word and everything's
[7:54] fine thank God and just keep moving on
[7:56] and see just long as it stays in the
[7:58] word that's my opinion what I think you
[8:01] should do brother Neville brother rutle
[8:04] brother chce and brother beer and all
[8:07] you Brethren here juny wherever you are
[8:09] and the rest of you Brethren God richly
[8:13] bless you I see Terry Lynn Charlie Cox

[8:29] of you be evangelism and set you
[8:31] somewhere see knowing that you come up
[8:33] you can stand and know the message and
[8:37] study to prove yourself you feel a call
[8:39] in your life I see two or three young
[8:42] men four or five sitting in a roll back
[8:44] here and and like that you're a young
[8:47] man I'm getting old brother Neville's
[8:49] getting old we're a middle-aged man if
[8:52] time rolls on we're going to walk off
[8:54] the scene at while you've got to fill
[8:56] our shoes see and and so you seeing that
[9:01] maybe in that day even it'll be growing
[9:03] greater if there is a tomorrow but while
[9:06] there is a today let's work why day
[9:08] tomorrow may never come if it does let
[9:10] be ready for it see what I mean now
[9:13] that's what I would than to you would it
[9:16] be wonderful to see a brother up there
[9:20] from
[9:21] udica Brother chce All You other
[9:24] Brethren Here Come Together meet come in
[9:28] a place you ministers set together and
[9:31] discuss things you've got to have
[9:33] Fellowship somewhere you've got to have
[9:35] something to come together to kind of
[9:37] get together about you all come together
[9:39] as a group of men and believe one with
[9:41] the other and like that and discuss
[9:43] these problems and set out maybe once a
[9:45] month just ministers alone let you meet
[9:47] somewhere in one of your churches sit
[9:50] there and discuss it and talk at each
[9:51] one of you pastors and evangelist and
[9:53] whatever you are and then if some great
[9:56] problem comes up you can't settle then
[9:58] if I'm called on the field of evangelism
[10:01] I don't know that it will be if I will
[10:02] be you know I'll be coming back
[10:04] constantly all the time and then if you
[10:06] get those things then when I come back
[10:08] here well we'll meet together and just
[10:10] sit down there one of you has a calling
[10:12] in your life we won't have like private
[10:14] interviews and things we've been having
[10:16] we'll just come right together and stay
[10:17] there till we have thus sayeth the Lord
[10:20] and if you can get the preacher straight
[10:22] and him going right look what he's going
[10:24] to do he's going to influence it would
[10:26] take care of the hundreds of these
[10:28] things that it were just beating at you
[10:30] see you got to get it a system God
[10:33] system like uh Jethro said to Moses why
[10:37] you can't beat out all of them or and
[10:40] God put Elders out there 70 of them and
[10:44] took the spirit was on Moses and put
[10:47] them up on those 70 elders and they
[10:50] prophesied and it didn't weaken Moses a
[10:53] bit and strengthen him he had just as
[10:55] much prophecy in him as he did before
[10:57] they took the spirit off of him that
[10:58] prophesy see he just separated sign of
[11:01] Moses let them judge the smaller things
[11:04] and but when it comes to the major
[11:05] things you come in with them and help
[11:07] him like that that's the way that was
[11:09] God's way back there that was God's way
[11:11] in the in the early church age and I
[11:14] believe it's God's way now that's right
[11:17] for us to do it so let's do it just quit
[11:21] talking about it and do it that's all we
[11:23] can do it by the grace of God don't you
[11:25] believe
[11:27] it now let's see all done tuck my time

[14:35] for a little bit of the word do you have
[14:37] it just for it's I know it's a little
[14:40] late but I had a little something here
[14:42] that I thought out today that I would
[14:44] like to to speak on just for a minute
[14:49] and it might help you and I thought
[14:51] first that I would announce this now
[14:55] it's on this tape and if anybody would
[14:58] ever want to to refer to it Jim have see
[15:02] to what I think ought to be done and now
[15:06] what should be done to the for you
[15:09] Brethren now do you know when those
[15:11] early men went out sometimes they were
[15:14] only about six or eight of them together
[15:17] and they shook the
[15:20] country well do you know when Aquilla
[15:22] and perscilla that great Revival that
[15:25] Apollos was having over there there's
[15:26] only about six or eight men and women in
[15:28] that b
[15:29] much that whole church meant six or
[15:32] eight you got five or six seven times as
[15:36] many here tonight as they had Dan you
[15:39] know Jesus only had 12
[15:41] Apostles we always think it for
[15:43] something big but God don't deal in them
[15:46] big numbers it's in these little groups
[15:48] is where he gets us in look all down
[15:51] through the age at any time he ever met
[15:52] with man it was in small groups see and
[15:56] spoke with him and ordained him it's
[15:59] God's good pleasure to do that that's
[16:01] way he likes to do it and now we just
[16:04] want to keep God in our midst and go do
[16:06] these things now Sunday
[16:08] morning Lord willing I want to speak to
[16:10] you on evening time
[16:12] evangelism and then I if the Lord
[16:16] permits I'll probably be leaving until
[16:18] late this fall and uh before I get back
[16:21] again I'll probably get back sometime in
[16:23] around in September and now I'm hoping
[16:27] but then that everything will move
[16:30] wonderfully for you Brethren and your
[16:32] meetings will grow in numbers and the
[16:34] grace of God be upon you all and until
[16:37] we meet and I'm trusting that you will
[16:40] pray for me and the success remember if
[16:44] your prayers for
[16:47] me that means you're my colleague you're
[16:50] you're my buddy my helper and together
[16:53] we are helpers in the Lord And now when
[16:55] I'm standing out there before the enemy
[16:58] I I want to remember that faithful true
[17:01] soldiers that gets prayer answered for
[17:03] the sick and The Afflicted and those men
[17:06] are praying for me I'm the one who needs
[17:09] it out there I'm really need it so you
[17:12] all pray for me when you GA don't forget
[17:14] me in any meeting pray for me now in St
[17:18] John the 9th chapter I want to read from
[17:21] the 26th verse until the 35th now just
[17:25] for a few minutes and then we'll we'll
[17:28] close in the next 20 or 30 minutes or
[17:31] maybe before that time the Lord willing
[17:33] now I want to read these scriptures now
[17:35] from St John 26 to uh St John 10 9 uh
[17:41] 26-35 I've got roll down here just
[17:44] something I thinking up then said they
[17:46] unto him again
[17:49] what did he do to
[17:53] thee how opened he thine
[17:56] eyes and he answered them I have told
[18:00] you already and you did not hear
[18:03] wherefore would you hear
[18:06] again will you also be his
[18:10] disciples then they reviled him and said
[18:14] died his disciples but we are moses'
[18:18] disciples we know that God spake unto
[18:21] Moses but for this fell we know not from
[18:26] whence he
[18:27] is the man answered and said unto
[18:31] them why herein is a marvelous thing
[18:36] that you know not from whence he is and
[18:39] yet he has opened mine
[18:41] eyes now we know that God heareth not
[18:45] Sinners but if any man be a worshipper
[18:48] of
[18:49] God and doeth His will him he heareth
[18:54] since the world began has it not heard
[18:59] that any man has opened the eyes of one
[19:01] that was born
[19:02] blind if this man were not of God he
[19:07] could do nothing then
[19:09] answered they answered and said unto
[19:13] him thou was allog together born in sin
[19:18] and does thou teach us and they cast him
[19:22] out and Jesus heard that they had cast
[19:25] him
[19:26] out and when he had found him he said
[19:29] unto him does thou believe on the Son of
[19:34] God
[19:36] now I'd like to speak just for a few
[19:39] minutes to you Brethren knowing at my
[19:42] little talk here I don't know what will
[19:44] become of it trusting that God will use
[19:47] it in some way and now in this upon his
[19:50] word so I know that brother Saint
[19:52] brother Neville or one of you ministers
[19:53] usually preach and just being here with
[19:56] you uh if you'll pardon me I just i'
[19:58] like to speak to you a little bit on
[19:59] this man now I want to take a subject
[20:02] here of taking sides with
[20:06] Jesus the
[20:08] Pharisees and leaders of his Day always
[20:13] tried to belittle him before the
[20:16] people that was just a way that the
[20:21] devil had a
[20:23] working all the Pharisees and the
[20:26] teachers of his day
[20:29] constantly tried to belittle
[20:33] Jesus they all the throw off that they
[20:36] could give to him they done
[20:39] it they watched him constantly to find
[20:42] where they could find a fault and they
[20:44] never spoke of his good things they were
[20:47] always finding something that they could
[20:50] belittle him about and say you see look
[20:53] here if he was a man of God he wouldn't
[20:56] do it this way or if he was a man of God
[20:59] he wouldn't do it that way they were
[21:01] trying to cast The Shadow upon him to
[21:05] get the people to disbelieving
[21:08] am that's the work of the
[21:11] devil and that old scheme has never
[21:15] ceased there's many times that a
[21:17] minister will make a
[21:19] mistake and if he comes into a
[21:21] neighborhood a precious brother who's
[21:24] trying to do what's
[21:27] right e
[22:16] and that old scheme has never ceased
[22:20] amen and and that old scheme has never
[22:23] ceased am there's many times that a
[22:27] minister will make a m
[22:29] State and if he comes into a
[22:31] neighborhood a precious brother who's
[22:33] trying to do what's right and to lead
[22:35] the people right everything that the
[22:38] devil can point to the unbeliever or the
[22:41] so-called Christian in that neighborhood
[22:44] to throw off on that man he'll do it you
[22:47] know the real Christian way is to hide
[22:50] everything you can from a brother don't
[22:52] tell his bad things just tell his good
[22:54] things just tell what you know about
[22:57] him's good if anything's dad let it
[22:59] alone poor Fell's got enough against him
[23:02] anyhow don't try to take a pole and
[23:04] shove a man further into the ditch the
[23:07] Christian attitude is pick him up and
[23:08] take him out of the ditch they don't
[23:11] never try to shove him down he's down
[23:13] already try to help him up and but too
[23:17] many of us today too many people today I
[23:20] might say try to do that if they could
[23:23] just get something and other that they
[23:26] could say that was real bad now for
[23:29] instance if if one of you Brethren make
[23:31] a mistake and do something's wrong which
[23:34] you're subject to do it I am too every
[23:37] one of us but as we go along let's
[23:40] remember we are
[23:42] brothers we are brothers and if we got
[23:45] any fighting let's fight with one
[23:47] another bring it together bring it
[23:49] before our Brethren and settle it now
[23:52] they used to in the Brandon family if
[23:54] one of the little ones done something he
[23:55] go tell Bill about it cuz I was the
[23:57] biggest and I had stand there and see
[23:59] which is right and wrong well my
[24:01] decision was that uh if they uh which
[24:05] one is right and wrong if they still
[24:06] didn't believe it then they got around
[24:08] behind my back and fought it out but
[24:09] they were still Brothers you see they
[24:11] fight in the backyard with one another
[24:14] and fight in the front yard far one
[24:15] another so that's the way it was see and
[24:18] it we still Brothers well that that's
[24:20] the way we we got to do this see and if
[24:23] you got something against somebody
[24:25] you're a brother don't tell somebody
[24:27] else about if it's wrong go to him and
[24:29] tell
[24:31] him and then if he's going to argue with
[24:34] you then take somebody else with you
[24:36] then bring it up the way the Bible said
[24:38] but
[24:39] Jesus they they just tried to find every
[24:43] little shadow that they could find to
[24:46] try to belittle him in the sight of the
[24:49] people and that's what the devil wants
[24:52] they want to they want to hurt your
[24:55] influence before the people amen that's
[24:58] where you want to watch careful what you
[25:00] do walk like real man of God talk like
[25:03] man of God see act like man of God live
[25:06] like man of God because a devil your
[25:09] adversary is going about like a roaring
[25:11] lion trying to devour what he
[25:13] can why did they do this they were
[25:17] jealous of him amen that was what's the
[25:19] reason they tried to believe him they
[25:21] were jealous of his ministry amen and
[25:25] that's the reason they were trying to
[25:26] belittle he had the ministry history of
[25:28] God and they knew that but it was
[25:30] contrary to their Creed so they were
[25:32] trying to belittle him make everything
[25:35] every little flaw that they could find
[25:37] get him out of the way they want him to
[25:39] quit they wanted the people to denounce
[25:41] him they wanted to say now uh this guy's
[25:45] nothing look here now there he is he he
[25:47] he did this and you know that's not
[25:49] right we've been taught all of our life
[25:51] that we should believe the elders and Y
[25:53] he is stood right there and ball that
[25:54] Elder out he disagreed with the
[25:57] tradition of the father and we've been
[25:59] we are to believe the tradition of our
[26:01] fathers we've been taught that by each
[26:03] Rabbi all the years through and here
[26:05] this man comes around and disagrees with
[26:07] them see well the man like that ain't
[26:09] fit to be a preacher see they were
[26:12] trying to belittling but in all of that
[26:16] the ones that believed him and loved him
[26:20] and had seen his scriptural Miracle
[26:22] signs would not be hindered by
[26:26] them no sir them who believed him
[26:29] believed him amen those who loved him
[26:32] stood by him they would not see what
[26:36] others pointed out to them oh if we
[26:39] could do that if we could just not see
[26:43] if somebody turn on here say you know
[26:45] what they say you're a Pentecostal not
[26:47] by denomination what you was the you you
[26:50] the kind of baptizes in Jesus name yep
[26:52] that's right well let me tell you
[26:54] something I Know a Man one time was
[26:55] baptized like that and he did so and so
[26:57] but look
[26:58] that has nothing to do with it it's a
[27:01] devil trying to throw a shadow on you
[27:03] they're always trying to point you to
[27:05] some old ship that got wrecked upon the
[27:07] seashore but they're not pointing to
[27:09] that one that made the void safely
[27:11] that's right that's right they're always
[27:14] trying to throw a crowbait out there and
[27:17] say this is example here's what did it
[27:20] uh I know a certain preacher that was a
[27:22] Holiness preacher and he did this that
[27:23] the other but they don't point out
[27:26] others that wasn't Holiness did that
[27:28] also you see and they don't point the
[27:30] great things that God did like somebody
[27:32] say oh here this man went too far he he
[27:35] went too far he might have done that he
[27:38] wrecked himself up he went too far he
[27:40] become a fanatic he might have done that
[27:43] but while they're pointing to how many
[27:44] that went one that went too far how
[27:46] about these millions that never went far
[27:49] enough Fable to see that see what I mean
[27:53] so the people tried them Pharisees and S
[27:58] seses and hypocrites and herodians and
[28:01] all tried to cast The Shadow on Jesus
[28:04] but them True Believers that was
[28:07] predestinated to hear that message heard
[28:10] it and SE no fault in it at
[28:13] all same now those who believe him love
[28:18] him those who believe him see no fault
[28:21] in him they don't see any heresy they
[28:23] don't see anything wrong they don't see
[28:25] anything wrong with his word they don't
[28:27] see anything wrong with his people they
[28:29] just see Jesus and that's all they're
[28:31] they're they're predestinate eternal
[28:34] life so they just take sides with Jesus
[28:36] and stay there we used to write sing a
[28:39] little song brother Roy uh Ro we used to
[28:42] sing a little song here I guess time you
[28:44] come here I take the way with the Lord's
[28:47] dispise few I started in with Jesus and
[28:50] I'm going through I'd rather walk with
[28:53] Jesus alone and have for my pillow like
[28:56] Jacob a stone
[28:59] [Music]
