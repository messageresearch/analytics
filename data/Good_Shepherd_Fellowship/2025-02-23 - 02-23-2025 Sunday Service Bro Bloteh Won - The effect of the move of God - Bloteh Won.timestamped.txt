[1:05:25] said we we want to get back and talking
[1:05:29] on the effect of the move of God praise
[1:05:32] the Lord amen the effect of the move of
[1:05:35] God if uh uh if you will stay with me as
[1:05:39] you we have always done we took this uh
[1:05:43] from Ephesian Church age if you have
[1:05:46] ever studied the history of Revival now
[1:05:49] a Revival signify the move of God in
[1:05:52] power that's what we've been talking
[1:05:53] about when we talk about the the the uh
[1:05:57] the move of God we are talking about the
[1:05:59] Revival and the Revival we are talking
[1:06:01] about is this end time Revival that's
[1:06:04] exactly what the message is it's not a
[1:06:06] cut it's not an organization it's just
[1:06:09] the move of God Amen is the move of God
[1:06:13] uh uh uh that that has crossed our path
[1:06:16] uh that the same God we read about in
[1:06:19] Genesis that came down from eternity
[1:06:22] condens himself and move in Genesis
[1:06:25] chapter one when the Bible says the
[1:06:27] spirit of God moved upon the waters that
[1:06:30] was where the move of God begins in time
[1:06:33] and since God started moving from
[1:06:35] Genesis one he had never stopped because
[1:06:38] there is nothing to stop him amen and
[1:06:40] there is nothing that is going to stop
[1:06:42] in our unbelief can stop in our fear can
[1:06:45] stop in our doubt can stop in neither
[1:06:48] politics can stop him praise the Lord
[1:06:50] because he's the creator of uh Heaven
[1:06:53] and Earth amen and uh and his word in
[1:06:56] Prophecy is greater than politics
[1:06:59] stronger than politics so we that's that
[1:07:01] just what we've been talking about you
[1:07:04] know what that move of God and we've
[1:07:05] been trying to see the positive effect
[1:07:09] of the move of God and also the negative
[1:07:12] effect the reason why we see the
[1:07:14] negative effect because brother Brandon
[1:07:17] sh here and every time God move Satan is
[1:07:21] there to move also praise the Lord so it
[1:07:25] is not h h a negative effect of the move
[1:07:29] of God but what it is it is a negative
[1:07:33] effect that is produced by an
[1:07:35] impersonation of the devil that's right
[1:07:38] amen amen it's a negative effect that is
[1:07:41] produced by uh uh
[1:07:44] impersonation impersonation of the devil
[1:07:46] so that's that's what we've been we've
[1:07:48] been studying around and we've been
[1:07:51] looking you know been picking up picking
[1:07:53] up yearing there but uh what what I was
[1:07:57] striving to do is to be able to take it
[1:07:59] in in every age we started in Genesis to
[1:08:02] show a little bit there you know in uh
[1:08:06] in uh uh with Noah and his sons that was
[1:08:09] one of the greatest move of God you know
[1:08:11] uh that a man would preach a message for
[1:08:13] 120 years amen and uh uh the Bible will
[1:08:17] call him a preacher of righteousness
[1:08:20] because uh uh you know uh uh he was able
[1:08:23] to to to to to get his household to
[1:08:27] believe his message amen and uh uh
[1:08:32] uh and and we see after that Revival
[1:08:37] after you know having the Revival of
[1:08:40] being under the world for 120 years you
[1:08:43] know their Revival went through the
[1:08:45] storm of the fla 40 days and night the
[1:08:48] rain bluring I mean that boat was hit
[1:08:52] left and right all over the place and
[1:08:55] and I I mean when it's g s and Noah his
[1:08:58] wife and Son's wife they all holding to
[1:09:01] the B they scared to death it just thing
[1:09:03] really going to stand the you know the
[1:09:06] the the the flood you know they look
[1:09:10] through the window they see all boats
[1:09:12] are destroyed and other people sinking
[1:09:14] drowning going up and down they are
[1:09:16] thinking are we going to end up like
[1:09:18] that praise the Lord you know uh uh uh
[1:09:21] but there was something in their hearts
[1:09:23] that was anchoring that uh you know uh
[1:09:26] uh uh he did this thing according to
[1:09:29] God's

[1:09:34] in that
[1:09:37] Revival praise the Lord amen wouldn't
[1:09:40] you love to have been in that
[1:09:44] Revival after you have you have preached
[1:09:48] about something or you have sat in the
[1:09:51] convention and you know in different
[1:09:53] churches and you hear the message preach
[1:09:55] and yet you see that the very thing that
[1:09:58] was talked about the judgment on the
[1:10:00] scene and you are realizing there are
[1:10:02] the the only thing that you are holding
[1:10:05] to is what has been preached to you yes
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:11] amen Noah boat was not on the lake and
[1:10:15] the other people was on the deep sea
[1:10:18] they were all flooded amen they were all
[1:10:22] under the same
[1:10:24] Waters are we
[1:10:26] together praise the
[1:10:28] Lord the only thing they heard onto is
[1:10:32] that God told him to build that
[1:10:38] boat that's the only
[1:10:41] thing that's the only thing there was no
[1:10:43] Hill to run onto there was no uh
[1:10:45] mountain to climb up no building nothing
[1:10:48] but just to hold them there we have done
[1:10:50] everything that we know how to do by the
[1:10:52] word of God Amen praise the Lord am and
[1:10:57] I believe that Noah F so convinced
[1:11:00] because at last it was God that closed
[1:11:02] the ark God sealed
[1:11:05] it praise the Lord amen so he knew that
[1:11:10] uh I mean uh uh uh I mean we are in here

[1:11:19] the god that that brought us in here
[1:11:22] praise the Lord hallelujah you see I
[1:11:25] believe that uh when those animers were
[1:11:28] coming into the AR that was the
[1:11:31] Supernatural part of that of that move
[1:11:33] of God everybody was looking at wow wow
[1:11:38] wow you mean all of these white beasts
[1:11:40] are in dead that was the supernatural
[1:11:43] but you see uh uh after the supernatural
[1:11:46] there had there have to be a time where
[1:11:48] the Revival have to be
[1:11:51] tested that's
[1:11:53] right praise the Lord L after the
[1:11:56] Miracles and the the prayer lines are
[1:11:59] over there have to be a time where the
[1:12:02] Revival have to be
[1:12:05] tested praise the Lord amen when we
[1:12:08] believe the Supernatural and then when
[1:12:11] we start to face the storm of the
[1:12:13] Revival we start backing
[1:12:17] up how are we going to TI Our
[1:12:20] Testimony yeah I believe it was God that
[1:12:23] spoke the scorus into existence I
[1:12:25] believe uh you know I believe this I
[1:12:28] believe that but then when the storm
[1:12:30] start hitting our
[1:12:34] boat then we says well I don't know I
[1:12:36] don't know how I don't know if uh you

[1:12:42] you know I don't know I don't know
[1:12:44] praise the Lord amen
[1:12:46] hallelujah so I mean that's that's what
[1:12:48] we are trying to look at because uh uh
[1:12:51] uh like I said this this is our time
[1:12:55] amen amen this is our time this is our
[1:12:59] portion of the Revival amen praise the
[1:13:02] Lord amen amen if if the Lord have

[1:13:42] prophet was here we appreciate you know
[1:13:44] what the different testimonies we hear
[1:13:46] from all over the world but this is
[1:13:48] where God put us amen and we want to do
[1:13:52] the best that we can do for his service
[1:13:56] amen we're not going to put it off for
[1:13:58] tomorrow it's now it's today amen amen
[1:14:01] are we together amen praise the Lord
[1:14:03] amen but think about it after they went
[1:14:06] through uh that uh uh storm of the
[1:14:08] Revival finally finally you know the the
[1:14:13] the I land there they could see you know
[1:14:16] man the life the destruction and just to
[1:14:19] believe just to see
[1:14:22] that they were the only people
[1:14:28] that
[1:14:30] remain praise the
[1:14:33] Lord just to see that they were the only
[1:14:40] household that remain on the
[1:14:43] earth praise the Lord amen you know what
[1:14:48] will happen one of these days when we
[1:14:50] come back to walk on the arches of the
[1:14:54] wicked praise the Lord
[1:14:58] amen that will be the Millennium the
[1:15:01] 1,000 years we will come right back to
[1:15:04] this earth amen praise the Lord
[1:15:07] amen and uh and the Beautiful Thing
[1:15:10] there is that God is not just going to
[1:15:12] seal our conscience no is the devil that
[1:15:15] will be bound for the Thousand Years
[1:15:18] amen but but we are going to be a light
[1:15:22] we are going to remember amen
[1:15:29] just like how they walk back on the
[1:15:31] earth after the
[1:15:33] Judgment after uh we will come back on
[1:15:36] the earth and we will walk back on the
[1:15:39] earth after the Earth has been
[1:15:42] judged think about
[1:15:48] it they were the only household that
[1:15:52] survived I believe they could remember
[1:15:54] all their friends all their neighbors
[1:15:56] and uh you know but they were nowhere
[1:16:01] around are we
[1:16:04] together and
[1:16:07] uh that was some mighty
[1:16:11] Revival but just at the end of that
[1:16:14] Revival after all of those Supernatural
[1:16:16] things have
[1:16:17] happened we see that uh you know
[1:16:21] something started happening back there
[1:16:25] and uh what was it there is there this
[1:16:29] uh
[1:16:32] uh
[1:16:35] preacher the Bible testify that
[1:16:38] uh uh Noah got he got
[1:16:44] drunk and his son H and all of that now
[1:16:48] so what am I trying to bring out of here
[1:16:50] is that there is there is a period of
[1:16:53] time where
[1:16:55] uh uh when when the move of God is going
[1:17:00] when when God is dealing with your heart
[1:17:02] you get to the peeg of your reality you
[1:17:05] believe that God is real you believe
[1:17:07] that uh you know the word of God is
[1:17:09] truth and you know and this thing is is
[1:17:12] becoming real to you and uh uh uh and
[1:17:16] and and there's also come a period of
[1:17:18] time where you go through your storms of
[1:17:21] life praise the Lord amen amen
[1:17:25] and sometime those storms of life uh uh
[1:17:29] send Our Roots deep into the Earth and
[1:17:31] try to establish Us in the truth praise
[1:17:35] the Lord amen but many times people
[1:17:37] don't see it like
[1:17:39] that they triers start to create many
[1:17:42] questions to them if God L me why am I
[1:17:45] going through this if I'm a Child of God
[1:17:47] why is this happening to me you're not
[1:17:49] sending your root deep you are ruling
[1:17:52] yourself out
[1:17:55] praise the Lord amen you are ruling
[1:17:57] yourself out because the first question
[1:17:59] you should have asked is that why was I
[1:18:03] born why am I
[1:18:07] here praise the Lord
[1:18:10] amen you see so then we go through that
[1:18:14] and and and it's one of the pH where we
[1:18:16] find ourself is there we have gone
[1:18:19] through a cycle of uh of Revival
[1:18:22] convention Supernatural I mean I mean
[1:18:25] there there was a time you you I mean
[1:18:27] you hear from this part of the world
[1:18:29] Australia what God is doing among the
[1:18:31] people there you hear in India you he
[1:18:33] and we we we experience all of those
[1:18:36] things I mean Mighty convention move of
[1:18:38] God the blessings of God and and uh but
[1:18:41] then we are we are now in the face of
[1:18:43] time where our Bo is hitting the storm
[1:18:47] amen many many are begin to questions
[1:18:51] and many are begin to to become trouble
[1:18:55] and it's also affecting
[1:18:57] some that uh as as as we saw uh uh in in
[1:19:03] in what BR Bram said here um uh in the
[1:19:06] days of the wor Revival he said what
[1:19:08] most people uh didn't know we make
[1:19:11] emphasis on there there are things that
[1:19:14] most most of us we don't know that we
[1:19:18] are not
[1:19:20] see because every time God
[1:19:23] moves Satan move
[1:19:26] also praise the
[1:19:28] Lord amen Abraham had his move we talk
[1:19:32] about the God of Second Chances he had
[1:19:35] his move God moved upon that young man
[1:19:38] and God was dealing with had brought him
[1:19:40] out of
[1:19:41] idolatry until uh he was finally able to
[1:19:45] come to the place of stepping into the
[1:19:48] land of can where God wanted him to be
[1:19:50] we saw the move of God and and to see
[1:19:53] how lot was also under that move because
[1:19:56] he traveled with Abraham he was under
[1:19:58] that move he saw you know the different
[1:20:01] things that Abraham came through and
[1:20:03] Abraham kept saying to him uh you know
[1:20:06] God said I will be the father of nation
[1:20:09] he said the same thing my uncle would be
[1:20:11] the father of nation he preached the
[1:20:13] message he believe it if L would he have
[1:20:15] gone to Sodom and have a Rous soul to be
[1:20:20] vexed against Sodom if the Revival of
[1:20:23] Abraham never affected his
[1:20:26] life amen for L to be in Sodom and to be
[1:20:30] disliking the things in Sodom even
[1:20:33] though he went away he he left Abraham
[1:20:37] and he went for you know a better life a
[1:20:39] better opportunity but because he was
[1:20:42] affected by that Revival there was
[1:20:45] something in him that hit the
[1:20:47] ungodliness of the city amen he never
[1:20:50] had enough to stand against it but there
[1:20:52] was something in him that he didn't like
[1:20:55] it amen amen amen amen are we together
[1:20:59] amen so he was affected by the
[1:21:01] Revival but you see he never reached to
[1:21:05] maturity he never reached to
[1:21:09] fullness are we
[1:21:15] together now so this morning we want to
[1:21:18] look at the move of God in the time of
[1:21:22] Moses the move of God in the time of
[1:21:24] Moses Moses we want to establish that
[1:21:27] God moves upon his word god move upon
[1:21:31] his promised word when God moved is to
[1:21:34] fulfill his word when he moved in
[1:21:37] Genesis it was to fulfill his word but
[1:21:40] that word that he was going to fulfill
[1:21:42] was his thoughts because a word is a
[1:21:45] thought Express so God moved in Genesis
[1:21:48] to to fulfill to express his thoughts
[1:21:51] the thought that he had in his mind when
[1:21:54] he was alone to dwell with his family it
[1:21:58] is upon that word upon that thought that
[1:22:01] God moves God just don't move because he
[1:22:04] needs to move or he want to move he
[1:22:07] moved based on the promise of his word
[1:22:10] that's the reason why brother brandham
[1:22:11] said we have to take a token we have to
[1:22:15] take a promised word when you want God
[1:22:18] to move take God's word and say Lord you
[1:22:21] promis this I want to see you acting
[1:22:24] upon your word because God moves upon
[1:22:27] his word he don't move you know Upon Our
[1:22:30] feelings he don't move you know because
[1:22:32] we have a lot of doubts and fear no you
[1:22:36] know the the unbelief will only handle
[1:22:39] the unbeliever but God mooved on the
[1:22:42] basis of his promis amen praise the Lord
[1:22:46] so what we read here in Exodus chapter 3
[1:22:49] was a promise that he gave to Abraham in
[1:22:52] Genesis 15 that your seed will so join
[1:22:55] in a Strange Land and I will come down
[1:22:58] with a mighty H that was his
[1:23:02] promise amen are we together amen that
[1:23:06] that was his promise if you want to see
[1:23:08] God moving hold his promise hold to his
[1:23:12] unchanging word bring his promise back
[1:23:15] to him and say Lord make this word real
[1:23:17] to me amen amen praise the Lord amen he
[1:23:21] moved upon his word he moved upon his
[1:23:23] promise so we see that there God was
[1:23:26] moving upon his promise he said after
[1:23:30] 400 years four generation I will come
[1:23:33] down with a mighty hand praise the Lord
[1:23:37] amen are we together
[1:23:43] amen four generation he was speaking to
[1:23:48] Abraham there in Genesis 15 giving him a
[1:23:51] promise that your seed will so Jo I will
[1:23:53] give you a son you don't have to you
[1:23:55] don't have to BART the promise that this
[1:23:58] seed will come through you and your wife
[1:24:00] Sarah praise the
[1:24:03] Lorden so God was confirming his promise
[1:24:07] four generation Abraham Isaac
[1:24:12] Jacob now Moses and the rest will come
[1:24:16] from Jacob SE from the from the Patriots
[1:24:18] from Joseph going down into Egypt so
[1:24:21] four generation God is now moving upon
[1:24:24] his
[1:24:25] promise praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:24:29] amen amen amen we see how that the same
[1:24:33] way he moved in the beginning the same
[1:24:36] way God moved in the beginning praise
[1:24:40] the
[1:24:40] Lord the great internal God took a body
[1:24:44] of light he took a form he condensed
[1:24:48] himself in a
[1:24:50] form and he stepped down into time it
[1:24:53] was that Pillar of Fire that was moving
[1:24:56] in the
[1:24:59] beginning and God took that same form
[1:25:02] again and he came and he hover over a
[1:25:06] bush that looks like a tree he hover
[1:25:10] over that and it looks like the tree was
[1:25:13] on
[1:25:14] fire he was trying to get the attention
[1:25:16] of
[1:25:17] Moses praise the Lord as we as we as we
[1:25:21] study this I was looking at something
[1:25:24] and uh uh trying to trying to develop it
[1:25:26] as we as we get as we go along with this
[1:25:29] to realize that
[1:25:33] uh we have to understand that that God
[1:25:37] is an intend of being amen there's no
[1:25:43] beginning with him he's an interal being
[1:25:46] and
[1:25:51] Eternity inity do not work on on our
[1:25:55] calendar or on our time schedule praise
[1:25:59] the Lord amen
[1:26:03] amen eternity is a dimension that is so
[1:26:10] fast it's so
[1:26:13] fast so
[1:26:16] fast you see that's the reason why
[1:26:18] Isaiah can say that the word of God do
[1:26:22] not go out and turn back to him V praise
[1:26:27] the Lord because in our human mind it it
[1:26:32] can appear like the promise is taking
[1:26:34] time but for God he has already achieved
[1:26:38] it when God sent out his word is so
[1:26:42] fast
[1:26:44] amen praise the Lord amen have you ever
[1:26:49] been able to to to uh uh uh imagine in
[1:26:53] your mind how does Divine Healing take
[1:26:56] place in the body someone that is sick
[1:26:59] laying on the cut in his pray for how do
[1:27:02] Divine Healing how do that sickness gets
[1:27:05] out and strength comes back in the
[1:27:07] person body Lazarus that was dead for 4
[1:27:11] days praise the Lord and Jesus called
[1:27:15] him how did all his b orat came back
[1:27:20] together how amen
[1:27:24] is by an eternal speed it's such a speed
[1:27:28] and I believe that that speed is here
[1:27:30] this morning and that's the reason why
[1:27:33] the word of God can hit a sinner heart
[1:27:36] it can hit the heart of a man that is
[1:27:39] struggling with something and said God I
[1:27:41] need your help and God can come down and
[1:27:44] that thing can get away from your life
[1:27:47] right now and right hereen
[1:27:54] a man that was dead four days after
[1:27:57] three days corruption sets in your nose
[1:28:00] sink in the body begin to Decay just by
[1:28:04] Jesus saying
[1:28:06] Lazarus come
[1:28:08] forth they in God
[1:28:12] spoke a bass
[1:28:15] time because we need time for our organ
[1:28:19] to develop
[1:28:24] praise the Lord the int of God spoke a
[1:28:28] bass time amen praise the Lord amen it
[1:28:33] cause a resurrection it cause a birth
[1:28:36] thank you Lord praise the Lord amen amen
[1:28:40] I believe that H H Lazarus never woke up
[1:28:43] with the sickness that he had whether he
[1:28:46] had liver problem all he had a cancer
[1:28:50] whatever he had he raised up with a
[1:28:53] brand new AR
[1:29:00] that's how fast eternity is
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:05] amen praise the Lord that's how fast
[1:29:09] amen we cannot fom it we can only
[1:29:13] appreciate it amen
[1:29:16] amen praise the Lord amen
[1:29:19] hallelujah that God can change sin to a
[1:29:24] Sint we can't f
[1:29:27] it it does not happen by Church ritual
[1:29:31] it does not happen by you know all the
[1:29:33] dos and DS and thec of the church is the
[1:29:37] power of almighty God the same creative
[1:29:41] power that said let there be light and
[1:29:44] there was light that same power comes
[1:29:47] and hit uh human nature amen gets right
[1:29:51] down into your blood strein sweep out
[1:29:54] Every curse from your parents and your
[1:29:56] your grandparents everything that have
[1:29:59] linger in their family that have kept

[1:30:04] through the word of God can clean your
[1:30:06] blood
[1:30:07] amen amen it can happens just amen
[1:30:12] that's why the Bible says in the
[1:30:14] twinkling of an
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:16] eye we will be
[1:30:19] change it's such a speed amen
[1:30:27] praise the Lord amen that that was the
[1:30:30] thing that that that that that that
[1:30:32] confused Moses that attracted him
[1:30:34] because he been on that mountain running
[1:30:36] around with his sheeps he have got
[1:30:38] himself a new carrier and and he's there
[1:30:41] taking care of she he knows the all the
[1:30:43] corners of the mountain but almighty God
[1:30:46] wanted to get his attention praise the
[1:30:49] Lord amen he's right in this little
[1:30:51] place fell in the sheep and God came so
[1:30:55] fast amen amen when he turn he
[1:30:59] just
[1:31:01] how who did
[1:31:04] that but what caught his attention was
[1:31:07] the leaves of the tree will stay grein

[1:31:15] tree and the leaves are not
[1:31:20] burning praise the Lord amen you see

[1:41:25] grab the attention of the people the
[1:41:27] same way he used the fire in the bush to
[1:41:30] grab Moses attention he did all of those
[1:41:33] things in Egypt just to grab the
[1:41:36] attention of the Hebrews that the god of
[1:41:39] Abraham Isaac and Jacob is among them
[1:41:42] and it's time to move
[1:41:44] amen just to let them know that the move
[1:41:47] is on and that is the thing that that
[1:41:50] must happen to a Son of God or a
[1:41:52] daughter of God when you pray to God and
[1:41:55] say Lord I'm having a headache oh God
[1:41:58] touch me touch my my head oh Lord move
[1:42:02] in this situation when God comes down

[1:42:46] you out it's the pillow of fire that
[1:42:48] created light in the camp of
[1:42:50] Gus and while the death angel is going
[1:42:53] to slay in the land of the
[1:42:56] Egyptians because the move was
[1:42:58] on God was
[1:43:01] moving are we together amen praise the
[1:43:04] Lord
[1:43:05] amen think about it when the Hebrews
[1:43:09] started to see that the Egyptians were
[1:43:13] begging praise the Lord amen the
[1:43:15] Egyptians started to beg and started to
[1:43:18] confess your God is
[1:43:21] real amen praise the Lord
[1:43:23] Lord
[1:43:25] amen instead of them using that moment
[1:43:29] to get a truth experience with God it
[1:43:32] always make the church to start bragging
[1:43:36] that God is in our midst that other
[1:43:38] church is a dead church that other
[1:43:39] churches there that's not why God show
[1:43:41] his power it's not for us to condemn
[1:43:44] it's for us to move from glory to glory
[1:43:47] is for us to bring our personal needs
[1:43:49] and say Lord I need more of you I see
[1:43:52] you helping me in this area I need help
[1:43:55] in this area amen amen because I know
[1:43:59] you in our midst I know that you are
[1:44:01] real amen amen if nobody will believe it
[1:44:05] I believe it because you did it to
[1:44:07] me
[1:44:10] amen praise the Lord
[1:44:12] amen but we so it's so easy for us to
[1:44:15] measure
[1:44:16] strength and I think that's what the
[1:44:18] Hebrews were doing they started
[1:44:20] measuring stength with with uh we told
[1:44:22] you people we told you about the God of
[1:44:24] Abraham we told you
[1:44:27] people and now they took the service
[1:44:29] into mockery when they hear the Egyptian
[1:44:33] crying they start
[1:44:35] laughing is it
[1:44:37] funny no it is not funny right praise
[1:44:41] the Lord amen it is God trying to show
[1:44:44] himself to you trying to make himself
[1:44:47] real to you because he's going to take
[1:44:49] you on a journey there is a trial time
[1:44:51] that is going to come if this God is not
[1:44:54] real to you the same one that you were
[1:44:57] worshiping you will turn around and
[1:44:59] insult him in the face that's right if
[1:45:01] he's not real to you right amen so it
[1:45:04] was no time to
[1:45:08] laugh it was no time to condemn
[1:45:11] them it was time for you to lift your
[1:45:13] hands up and say God thank you thank you
[1:45:16] for your word thank you for speaking to
[1:45:17] me Lord God deal with my heart change my
[1:45:20] life make me a better person let this
[1:45:23] become so
[1:45:24] real praise the Lord hallelujah oh I
[1:45:29] believe that's why Joshua and KB was
[1:45:31] doing they were scking close to Moses
[1:45:34] every time he's talking about the
[1:45:36] Supernatural and talking about how God
[1:45:38] there with him by the backside of the
[1:45:40] desert they were I mean they were just

[1:48:29] right are we together they started
[1:48:32] hearing the noise and and I mean they
[1:48:34] all shaking in their boat they are
[1:48:36] afraid what's going to
[1:48:38] happen that's why we
[1:48:41] said Moses you just brought us here to
[1:48:44] Die the others that supposed to be H you
[1:48:48] know holding one another hand and saying
[1:48:50] the god of Abraham the god of Isaac come

[1:49:02] crying and you know what happened when
[1:49:05] you get into that attitude you lost
[1:49:07] strength you can't go any faster
[1:49:10] again you can't go any
[1:49:13] faster you think you are going faster
[1:49:15] but your mind
[1:49:17] condition has reduced your
[1:49:21] strength praise the Lord
[1:49:23] you start dragging your F you start
[1:49:25] looking for place of es Escape oh my God
[1:49:28] it's all rck there's no Bush here praise
[1:49:31] the Lord amen you think you are walking
[1:49:34] fast but you're just looking for place
[1:49:36] of
[1:49:40] Escape are we together
[1:49:43] am if you ever if you ever been run
[1:49:46] after you know what I'm talking about
[1:49:48] amen if you ever been run after where
[1:49:51] you know that your life is on the line
[1:49:53] you know what I'm talking
[1:49:57] about glory be to
[1:50:01] God when the 10 10 plages were going on
[1:50:04] it was a Revival for them it was a
[1:50:07] Revival they were just they were they
[1:50:08] were just shouting and and rejoicing you
[1:50:11] hear what happened today he spoke
[1:50:15] frogs and there is frogs all in the
[1:50:17] palace that just all they are talking
[1:50:19] about
[1:50:22] but are they really seeing the creative
[1:50:25] power of God are they really seeing that
[1:50:28] this God that spoke frogs into existing
[1:50:31] he can take hatred out of my
[1:50:35] heart because they have hatred against
[1:50:38] the Egyptians right they hated them
[1:50:41] because they a treated
[1:50:43] them so the normal human attitude is to
[1:50:48] rejoice when your enemy is suffering so
[1:50:51] that was the attitude that they talk and
[1:50:53] when you take that kind of attitude you
[1:50:55] are not appreciating God's word that's
[1:50:58] not the reason why God moved on the
[1:51:00] scene remember now God was not doing it
[1:51:03] because they were loyal to God he was
[1:51:05] doing it because it was his promise
[1:51:07] right amen amen are we
[1:51:14] together and the people started putting
[1:51:16] pressure on Moses they started yelling
[1:51:19] the children are crying the women they
[1:51:22] sto walking they're all rolling on the
[1:51:23] ground I'm already dead I'm already dead
[1:51:26] oh my God this e going to they started
[1:51:28] rolling on the ground they putting so
[1:51:30] much pressure they can't move anymore
[1:51:32] remember Moses said we're not leaving
[1:51:34] one thing behind that's right so if one
[1:51:36] person sit down they have to wait until
[1:51:38] that pressing together for them to go
[1:51:40] thank you Lord
[1:51:42] amen so much
[1:51:49] pressure don't tell Moses himself joined
[1:51:51] the crowd
[1:51:54] amen starting to cry out thank you
[1:52:00] B praise the Lord amen starting to cry
[1:52:05] out God said why cry
[1:52:07] Moses speak praise the
[1:52:11] Lord he saw that his servant was
[1:52:13] affected by the people by their complain
[1:52:17] and they crying and and and all they

[1:52:42] God are you are you seeing the picture
[1:52:46] amen amen in every age when God
[1:52:51] move sat on is there to
[1:52:53] move praise the
[1:52:58] Lord when he got that
[1:53:02] first round of trial God came down they
[1:53:06] saw the red seed
[1:53:08] open the people walk on dry ground they
[1:53:12] never took Kino they never took boat
[1:53:15] it's not a shape God splited the water
[1:53:17] before their natural eyes they saw the
[1:53:21] water roll back in was
[1:53:24] hanging I believe no doubt as they were
[1:53:27] walking through they can put their hands
[1:53:29] here and touch the
[1:53:32] water and L it on their tongue I touch
[1:53:34] it I took some I put it on my
[1:53:37] tongue praise the Lord amen amen you see
[1:53:41] like you go to all of these places where
[1:53:43] they get this Fountain the water just

[1:53:49] but it become a steing water it just
[1:53:52] keep falling praise the
[1:53:56] Lord and it went on the other
[1:54:04] side and the Bible will talk about God
[1:54:07] feeling feing these people with Angels F
[1:54:11] man will fall in the morning they will
[1:54:13] get out they would take
[1:54:15] it they wanted water God gave them water
[1:54:19] they wanted meat God gave them meat
[1:54:23] and told them you will eat until I will
[1:54:25] come through your
[1:54:28] nose praise the
[1:54:30] Lord but with all of that with all of
[1:54:35] that the Bible says the people were
[1:54:38] complaining for
[1:54:39] garlic the garlic of
[1:54:43] Egypt their had was stay in
[1:54:47] Egypt something back in Egypt was
[1:54:50] grapping their attention was troubling
[1:54:54] them the heart was stay back in
[1:54:58] Egypt you remember their old ways of
[1:55:01] life they want to get down to the club
[1:55:04] they still wanted to get find a time and
[1:55:07] get
[1:55:09] drunk with all with all the supernatural
[1:55:12] things that they saw they still had a
[1:55:15] taste of Egypt in their
[1:55:19] heart praise the Lord amen
[1:55:23] remember now it's a spirit of Revival
[1:55:26] it's the history of Revival it has not
[1:55:31] changed it's not the excitement of the
[1:55:35] preaching but it's for this word to be
[1:55:37] made flesh amen amen is for this word to
[1:55:42] be made flesh the word must change our
[1:55:45] life praise the
[1:55:48] Lord it should change our life what can
[1:55:50] that go we sering
[1:55:53] I mean he's he will be so much of a
[1:55:55] distant God when we can only visit him
[1:55:58] in church he goes back to heaven and we
[1:56:01] go back to our Natural Life praise the
[1:56:06] Lord if God is so real to
[1:56:09] you and you are you are you are
[1:56:12] struggling with a habit of living with
[1:56:14] something you will you will be so
[1:56:16] embarrassed because you know that that
[1:56:18] God that you serve is a presentent God
[1:56:21] there is no way where you can go to hide
[1:56:23] from him it brings you such a conviction
[1:56:26] that you don't want to live in that
[1:56:28] lifestyle because you know is not
[1:56:30] pleasing to
[1:56:32] him it's only an idol that you can go in
[1:56:36] a peace leave it at the shrine and then
[1:56:38] go by your life but not this God he's a
[1:56:42] living God amen amen he's a living God
[1:56:46] among a living people amen
[1:56:53] are we together
[1:56:58] amen Numbers chapter 16 let's read
[1:57:02] Numbers chapter
[1:57:10] 16 the people traveled with
[1:57:13] Moses they saw the supernatural they ate
[1:57:16] the man they saw all of this as time
[1:57:19] progress as time progress in their
[1:57:23] Journey they start getting
[1:57:25] tired of just one man leading
[1:57:30] them praise the Lord Numbers chapter
[1:57:34] 16 but before we read Numbers chapter 16
[1:57:37] why you keep your hands there let me
[1:57:39] read this to you from spoken word is the
[1:57:42] Original
[1:57:49] Seed now that's why each
[1:57:52] Revival has its own Revival or each
[1:57:55] generation has its own Revival praise
[1:57:59] the Lord amen because the Revival of the
[1:58:05] past is just like a painted picture
[1:58:08] praise the Lord amen and you can't get
[1:58:12] warm by pain a picture you need a real
[1:58:14] fire to make you warm amen praise the
[1:58:19] Lord so each generation has his own
[1:58:22] Revival God raises him up a man and set
[1:58:27] and set him with his word and start him
[1:58:31] out for the message for their age and as
[1:58:35] soon as that man man is taking of the
[1:58:38] sin somebody else catches it and HB it
[1:58:43] praise the Lord amen amen somebody
[1:58:47] catches it and hybrate it then that's
[1:58:49] where the negative effect of the move of
[1:58:52] God comes in because it's no longer the
[1:58:55] same when the word is
[1:58:58] hybrid when people starts to form clubs
[1:59:02] and Clin around the message it can never
[1:59:05] be the same we might keep the dress code
[1:59:08] we might keep the langard and say the
[1:59:10] same thing the prophet said the prophet
[1:59:12] said but it's not going to be the same
[1:59:15] because we will not produce that life
[1:59:22] and when we are not meeting up with the
[1:59:24] life then we know that the word has been
[1:59:27] high bre
[1:59:30] somewhere if God is for us where are the
[1:59:33] Miracles that's what H gide said where
[1:59:35] is that God that changes life where is
[1:59:39] th
[1:59:40] God that took that young lady on the
[1:59:43] street of
[1:59:46] Chicago praise the Lord am amen
[1:59:52] all the the the the the alcohol
[1:59:56] treatment center gave up on
[2:00:00] her praise the
[2:00:03] Lord they left her to die that mean they
[2:00:06] have tried to treat her through all the
[2:00:08] program I mean she she was just she was
[2:00:10] just so much in this horrible
[2:00:14] place until someone drag her to the
[2:00:17] meeting of brother Brandon where is that
[2:00:20] God
[2:00:24] that could change that young
[2:00:26] lady flush out the desires and and and
[2:00:31] and and everything the alcohol the way
[2:00:33] it had destroyed her body until she was
[2:00:36] lying to
[2:00:38] die
[2:00:40] Rosetta brother talked about
[2:00:46] Rosetta until people that knew her
[2:00:55] just like the woman that the were they
[2:00:57] only God convinced because they knew her
[2:01:00] lifestyle so when she said come and see
[2:01:03] the man that told me they wanted to see
[2:01:05] that man because they knew her
[2:01:09] lifestyle that same God can change
[2:01:12] habits he can break habits he can break
[2:01:15] strongo in our life
[2:01:19] amen that's what I'm talking about that
[2:01:21] that is the positive move of of uh H H
[2:01:25] positive effect of the move of
[2:01:31] God when a man catches
[2:01:34] it and hybrid is no longer the
[2:01:38] same it all falls back to a perfect
[2:01:42] everything I could stop here for the
[2:01:45] meaning we are in a hurry see go back
[2:01:48] and exactly what is uh H what started
[2:01:52] way in the beginning in Genesis God set
[2:01:55] for a crop of human race and Eve hybd
[2:02:00] when she took the devil Li amen he said
[2:02:04] a crop it was a perfect crop a man made
[2:02:06] in the image of God a one that could
[2:02:09] pick up God
[2:02:10] thoughts and that's where we are getting
[2:02:13] back to we must be able to pick up the
[2:02:16] thoughts of God you see situation your
[2:02:18] mind goes back to the word this is what
[2:02:20] the word says about it
[2:02:22] praise the Lord I I was I was I was
[2:02:25] tempted almost to to speak on the on the
[2:02:29] red haer I saw the red halfer uh thing

[2:02:34] in uh uh

[2:02:42] was on the on the on the YouTube I was
[2:02:46] floating around about Israel you know
[2:02:48] were getting the the red half and I was
[2:02:50] thinking about that so right in the time
[2:02:52] I was listening to to a message brother
[2:02:56] preach on Christ and then he's talking
[2:02:58] about the red
[2:02:59] harer and it it's it's just so beautiful
[2:03:04] very beautiful when you look into the
[2:03:05] word think about it this way let me let
[2:03:08] me step out yet a little bit like I
[2:03:09] always do hope I can find my way back
[2:03:12] amen think about it the red harer that
[2:03:17] peculiar animal that was used for an
[2:03:20] atonement amen that was the only animal
[2:03:25] arches that could be used as a water of
[2:03:29] Separation not just any boot it had to
[2:03:32] be this special animal now think about
[2:03:35] it now the rare
[2:03:40] haer was a female
[2:03:45] animal praise the Lord amen think about
[2:03:49] it you think about it think about it now
[2:03:52] like brother BR taught us the W God gave
[2:03:56] the woman The Virtue because of
[2:03:57] redemption think about how much God had
[2:04:00] redemption in his mind this this red
[2:04:04] harer it is not uh H uh like a h h a set
[2:04:10] breed of animal that can have that is
[2:04:12] it's it's a it's a haer that is born
[2:04:15] it's born that way in the midst of all
[2:04:18] the other cattles is born their way and
[2:04:22] is born a
[2:04:28] female praise the Lord think about it
[2:04:31] think about it God in his peculiar mind
[2:04:36] whenever a rare Halford is born is never
[2:04:39] a
[2:04:41] male it's a
[2:04:46] female praise the Lord amen go and read
[2:04:49] uh H H numbers and see what uh Moses
[2:04:52] will say take her arches it's always her
[2:04:57] arches it's never his
[2:05:04] arches are we together
[2:05:08] amen she's born a female it's a female
[2:05:11] so think about it now Y is a female
[2:05:15] animer representing
[2:05:18] Christ oh my goodness hey
[2:05:22] amen here is a female
[2:05:25] animal representing

[2:05:34] amen okay is Christ in Bride form for
[2:05:38] you amen praise the Lord that's what I
[2:05:42] say to few of uh of of the Saints you
[2:05:45] know I just I just took few quotes from
[2:05:47] that message and and sent it to to them
[2:05:49] and and and and and the reason they is
[2:05:52] there I want I want us to grab it in as
[2:05:55] much as it's a beautiful thing Israel is
[2:05:58] having the red half of glory be to God
[2:06:00] they will go back to their sacrifice but
[2:06:02] you see it's so easy for us to miss what
[2:06:05] is happening in our midst what is
[2:06:08] happening in our midst God has got a
[2:06:11] people that he has called to a life of
[2:06:14] sanctification where Christ once again
[2:06:17] will be made in bright form that red
[2:06:20] half is represent this last day
[2:06:23] bride thank you
[2:06:25] Lord that's supposed to bring forth such
[2:06:28] a
[2:06:30] life that will create a water of
[2:06:32] Separation but you see we get fascinated
[2:06:35] over those things is we must we must
[2:06:37] thank God for it I mean it happen in our
[2:06:40] generation we can see it what is in the
[2:06:42] scripture we are seeing it but how does
[2:06:44] he apply to
[2:06:47] us how does he apply to us
[2:06:55] and that's what that's what we that's
[2:06:57] what we want to catch how does it apply
[2:06:59] to
[2:07:02] us it's a
[2:07:04] peculiar female animer that is only born
[2:07:09] for that
[2:07:12] purpose she's born for that purpose and
[2:07:15] when the When when when when the when
[2:07:17] the days of of sacrifices has been gone
[2:07:21] Israel had never had
[2:07:25] it they have not had
[2:07:28] it they don't have a temple that's the
[2:07:31] reason why when they are seeing the red
[2:07:33] harer is giving them a desire to get
[2:07:36] their Temple back because sacrifice must
[2:07:39] be must be made
[2:07:43] amen are we together
[2:07:47] amen Paul says without blood there is no
[2:07:50] remission
[2:07:54] Israel is having a bloodless
[2:07:57] worship they don't have no sacrifice
[2:07:59] they don't have no
[2:08:01] blood and God will not accept no
[2:08:04] sacrifice without blood right that's
[2:08:06] what he did to King he refused King
[2:08:08] sacrifice because it did not have blood
[2:08:11] right but you and myself this morning
[2:08:14] our sacrifice have a blood we have the
[2:08:17] bleeding word in our
[2:08:20] m we have the bleeding word yes
[2:08:26] amen praise the Lord
[2:08:30] amen the blood is not the chemistry is
[2:08:33] the life that is in the blood has come
[2:08:35] back on the word to make it real to you
[2:08:37] and
[2:08:43] myself in every
[2:08:46] age God gave each
[2:08:49] generation a Revival what is that
[2:08:52] Revival now the multitude a move of God
[2:08:57] Amen he
[2:08:59] move and make his presence real amen
[2:09:03] make himself real
[2:09:10] amen are we
[2:09:14] together Luther set forth all the rest
[2:09:17] Christ set forth the apostles set forth
[2:09:19] the prophet set forth then Jesus said
[2:09:22] which one of you have uh uh uh which one
[2:09:25] of you have not your father persecuted
[2:09:28] the prophets that God sent unto you
[2:09:30] didn't he teach that a king one time
[2:09:32] sent his servant and then sent another
[2:09:34] sevenant and sent another sevenant and
[2:09:36] so forth what was he doing giving each
[2:09:39] age a chance to the
[2:09:41] word each age has a chance to the
[2:09:47] word praise the Lord amen
[2:09:56] each generation in each generation
[2:09:58] receiving CA is is repeating right back
[2:10:02] Adam Adam and Eve again their first crop
[2:10:06] in the Garden of Eden half of them lost
[2:10:09] wise virgin sleeping virgin half of them
[2:10:13] one kept the word the other HB
[2:10:18] it praise the Lord amen and then when
[2:10:22] the word is
[2:10:24] hybrid that's where the negative effect
[2:10:27] comes from why because they will be
[2:10:30] using the
[2:10:31] word but yet they are producing a wrong
[2:10:36] action a wrong fruit a wrong
[2:10:41] life praise the Lord they are using the
[2:10:46] word they are quoting the scripture
[2:10:49] using the Bible
[2:10:55] and yet creating conditions why we must
[2:10:57] live under
[2:11:01] privilege praise the Lord
[2:11:04] amen I was talking to a young lady
[2:11:07] yesterday one of my
[2:11:09] girls called me we were just talking
[2:11:13] from one thing to another I've been talk
[2:11:15] to her for a long time and just sharing
[2:11:18] different things talking
[2:11:22] and then she told me something she said
[2:11:24] uh she said she said had I had a tough
[2:11:28] time recently I bought me into one of
[2:11:30] these uh you know uh uh uh things on the
[2:11:35] internet and I didn't I didn't know how
[2:11:37] how much that was going to affect me it
[2:11:40] really put me down a rough place she
[2:11:43] says I I struggle with it you know uh uh
[2:11:46] and
[2:11:47] uh and I thank God there so you know we
[2:11:50] talk a little bit and I was telling her
[2:11:53] and just sharing with her I I said think
[2:11:55] about this you know I said think about
[2:11:59] this how can a
[2:12:01] person claim that the word of God is
[2:12:05] keeping them in bondage at the time the
[2:12:08] word is keeping you in bondage you are
[2:12:11] living a clean life you are faithful to
[2:12:15] your to your
[2:12:17] husband you the were keeping you in
[2:12:19] punished though
[2:12:22] but yeah you are living a clean
[2:12:24] life you are faithful to your husband
[2:12:28] you appreciate
[2:12:30] decency the were keeping you in
[2:12:33] bondage but now you have found something
[2:12:35] that have make you
[2:12:38] free it make you so free that you can
[2:12:41] sleep with
[2:12:44] anybody you can defy your marriage vow
[2:12:48] on you can dress on decent go half
[2:12:51] pretty much naked in the street what
[2:12:54] kind of for freedom is
[2:12:56] that what kind of for
[2:12:59] freedom is
[2:13:03] that praise the Lord amen
[2:13:06] am I told this young I said I said think
[2:13:09] about it for a while because sometimes
[2:13:11] that's that's the kind of argument
[2:13:14] that's the kind of a thing these people
[2:13:16] want us to believe that they are free
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:22] that while they were sitting on on the
[2:13:23] message was just such a bonish for them
[2:13:26] I mean they were just a bonish I mean
[2:13:28] bonish but you are
[2:13:31] decent anybody can see you and take her
[2:13:34] their C that this is a lady because
[2:13:36] she's dressed like a
[2:13:38] lady but now you are free that you can
[2:13:42] expose your body to the entire public
[2:13:44] because you are free what is
[2:13:47] that is that why they want us to believe
[2:13:51] is that the law of
[2:13:53] Liberty that the gospel brings to
[2:13:59] us let me get
[2:14:01] back because I have to close here amen
[2:14:05] let me get back because I have to close
[2:14:07] just bear with me and I will be done in
[2:14:09] few minutes amen amen one keep the word
[2:14:14] the other hybrid it right back and forth
[2:14:16] just as hard as it can go right like
[2:14:19] that is being right down Through the
[2:14:22] Ages we will prove it by the word of God
[2:14:25] and by history year
[2:14:28] that that's right H breing HB
[2:14:32] breing first started in Eden started in
[2:14:37] Genesis is the
[2:14:39] beginning and it ends up in
[2:14:42] Revelation praise the
[2:14:45] Lord
[2:14:47] amen ends up in
[2:14:49] Revelation uh the second coming of
[2:14:52] Christ now remember
[2:14:54] correctly that's why each
[2:14:57] generation has its own
[2:15:01] Revival it gets a chance at the
[2:15:06] word God don't want you to take what I
[2:15:10] say for it he want you to get a
[2:15:14] chance at the word a personal chance at
[2:15:18] the word not a second-handed chance
[2:15:22] now something that is passed down to you
[2:15:24] from somebody he want a personal
[2:15:28] change amen praise the Lord amen amen
[2:15:33] each generation had a chance of the
[2:15:41] word because that
[2:15:44] word will begin the move of
[2:15:47] God and it will start leading those
[2:15:50] people right back into Eden for
[2:15:52] Fellowship it will start Leading the
[2:15:54] People right back to that place and
[2:15:56] start to produce the same
[2:15:59] result that the first move produced what
[2:16:03] did it do it change a earth that was in
[2:16:07] chaos the water over the deep it changed
[2:16:10] it it created an
[2:16:13] Eden where man and Beast live
[2:16:16] together the peace of God passes all
[2:16:20] understanding
[2:16:21] the glory of God was so much down like
[2:16:24] the water covered of
[2:16:30] seed but right here in Numbers chapter
[2:16:33] 16 we
[2:16:35] see after the gone through all of
[2:16:38] this this man Kor ab and
[2:16:43] dayon it says there is too much too much
[2:16:46] with this
[2:16:48] Moses too much where were
[2:16:51] you where were where were these men they
[2:16:54] were all there in Egypt did they ever
[2:16:56] stood before pharaoh and said let my
[2:16:58] people
[2:17:03] go but now they are challenging
[2:17:06] Moses and say you are of the Trap of
[2:17:08] Levi I'm of the Trap of Levi what make
[2:17:11] you
[2:17:13] special what make you special why should
[2:17:16] always be
[2:17:19] you why should be you why it must always
[2:17:22] be brother Brandon
[2:17:26] say praise the Lord
[2:17:34] amen and the Bible says they rose up
[2:17:36] against
[2:17:37] Moses and you know what
[2:17:40] today Jew called him a man of gain say
[2:17:44] they have so much words to convince
[2:17:47] people they went around the camp
[2:17:53] and
[2:17:54] started winning the people by their
[2:17:57] sweet talk where was he by the way where
[2:18:00] was he when we build that Palace where
[2:18:02] was he when when when when we make the
[2:18:06] road and he did all of
[2:18:09] this praise the Lord
[2:18:15] amen challenging Moses on the word
[2:18:27] Hallelujah you know what happened praise
[2:18:30] the
[2:18:32] Lord they got so much people to believe
[2:18:35] them you think about it
[2:18:38] now it will appear that these people are
[2:18:42] innocent it will appear that well I mean
[2:18:45] God should have just de with Koran and
[2:18:47] dayon and ab
[2:18:52] are we
[2:18:57] together why they sit
[2:19:01] there they see almighty God coming down
[2:19:05] and says Moses separate
[2:19:07] yourself all of these innocent people
[2:19:11] they were all Buried one
[2:19:13] day in the mass
[2:19:17] grave they were all buried in the M's
[2:19:20] grave
[2:19:24] grave because they started to challenge
[2:19:27] God's
[2:19:28] anointed praise the Lord
[2:19:32] amen whenever God
[2:19:35] moves Satan also move amen just like how
[2:19:40] it was from the beginning in the first
[2:19:42] Revival it's the same thing that is that
[2:19:44] will happening around
[2:19:47] us there will be men that will rise up
[2:19:49] to challenge the word and challenge the
[2:19:51] message of the
[2:19:52] hour they can go and find F and and and
[2:19:56] says well you know he's not really H
[2:19:58] amr's son he was he was an Egyptian you
[2:20:01] know we find his birth certificate they
[2:20:03] could bring all of those argument but it
[2:20:06] does not matter to God
[2:20:08] right it's God that put his love on a
[2:20:11] man it's God that choose a man it's God
[2:20:13] that called a manen amen it's God that
[2:20:17] that Sanctified a man for the job
[2:20:30] are we
[2:20:31] together so you
[2:20:34] see why would God slay those innocent
[2:20:37] people is because they were undertaking
[2:20:41] what others were saying they were not
[2:20:43] finding Their Own Foundation in
[2:20:46] truth they were not establishing thems
[2:20:49] in the word
[2:20:51] when the word is there is is before us
[2:20:54] why can't we go there why should we take
[2:20:56] what people
[2:20:58] say especially when it comes to
[2:21:01] challenging you know the authority of
[2:21:03] God's
[2:21:08] word the move of God on both
[2:21:11] end there is a positive effect and a
[2:21:15] negative effect praise the Lord amen
[2:21:19] amen amen
[2:21:21] the positive effect brought the people
[2:21:23] out of Egypt they saw the supernatural
[2:21:26] right there were two men that were that
[2:21:29] were affected with this Caleb and Joshua
[2:21:32] and they were even ready to go and take
[2:21:34] the land we are more than
[2:21:36] able the Young Generation also of those
[2:21:39] people that were born in the wilderness
[2:21:41] they did not cross Jordan they did not
[2:21:44] saw the plague they never saw the
[2:21:47] supernatural they were born in the
[2:21:48] wilderness and many of us are people
[2:21:51] that are born in the
[2:21:53] wilderness because we were not yet uh uh
[2:21:56] in
[2:21:58] 1965 praise the Lord
[2:22:00] amen but those young people they were so
[2:22:04] influenced by Caleb and Joshua to
[2:22:07] believe that that is their inheritance
[2:22:10] the land belongs to them
[2:22:14] amen that's why Peter can say This
[2:22:16] Promise is unto you and to your children
[2:22:20] yeah into as many as the Lord Our God
[2:22:23] shall call even though you were not
[2:22:25] there with us when we were with Jesus
[2:22:27] but I'm telling you that the resurrected
[2:22:29] Jesus is here today amen thank you Lord
[2:22:34] amen praise the
[2:22:39] Lord if God word can take us out of our
[2:22:44] struggle and take us you know and and
[2:22:47] and and and and and and give us a home
[2:22:49] and and give us a
[2:22:51] family give us a sense of
[2:22:55] decency create earnesty in our heart we
[2:22:58] don't have to
[2:23:00] lie we don't have to struggle in our
[2:23:02] mind how to say it so they can accept it
[2:23:04] say it the way it happens
[2:23:11] right is the grace of
[2:23:14] God it's the grace of
[2:23:17] God that has brought us this far
[2:23:23] it's that move of God upon your
[2:23:25] heart that is creating the fear of God
[2:23:28] in
[2:23:31] you that can take you down to your
[2:23:34] knees and make you to live for your
[2:23:36] hands say Lord I need more of you
[2:23:44] amen let's not think that we have
[2:23:47] arrived no
[2:23:50] because many of them died in the
[2:23:52] wilderness they never got into the
[2:23:54] promised land praise the Lord isn't that
[2:23:57] how many years we've been walking with
[2:23:59] Moses how many years we've been in the
[2:24:01] message that's not what matters what
[2:24:03] matter is you taking your inheritance
[2:24:06] right amen you get into the place to be
[2:24:08] a Son of God and a daughter of
[2:24:11] God and living it out that's what
[2:24:14] matters is not we are not counting years
[2:24:16] and counting age
[2:24:23] the more we see God doing the more he
[2:24:26] humble us
[2:24:27] amen when we see God moving in our homes
[2:24:31] and moving in our lives and helping us
[2:24:34] in different situations that we are
[2:24:36] dealing with the more it humble us and
[2:24:40] the more we cry Lord fill my cup
[2:24:44] Lord and LIF it up today amen praise the
[2:24:48] Lord amen amen amen
[2:24:51] as we go along we bring different types
[2:24:54] to see that it happened through all the
[2:24:57] ages the things that are happening
[2:24:58] around us is not strange the only thing
[2:25:01] that is different they never have
[2:25:04] Facebook and YouTube to publicize
[2:25:08] it but they were doing the same
[2:25:14] thing Facebook and YouTube is just gain
