[56:26] of the father full of grace and truth
[56:30] praise the Lord amen tonight just for
[56:33] the little exhortation and uh uh where
[56:38] the word will become a
[56:40] token uh that goes uh after our prayers
[56:45] tonight uh we want to talk on the word
[56:48] was made
[56:49] flesh the word was made flesh praise the
[56:53] Lord amen if I if I would try to sum up
[56:57] which of course I'm not very good in it
[56:59] but if I would try to sum up the
[57:01] services on the weekend I think like I
[57:04] said Saturday night was the exaltation
[57:06] of Jesus Christ he was he was exalted
[57:10] amen and then uh Sunday was the
[57:14] manifestation of of Jesus
[57:17] Christ praise the Lord amen he was
[57:21] exalted in uh in in in the revelation of
[57:24] knowing who he was
[57:27] and then also on Sunday it was his
[57:30] manifestation he was talking about the
[57:32] anointing there was the manifestation of
[57:35] Jesus Christ the word being made flesh
[57:37] so tonight we just want to encourage
[57:40] ourself a little bit and talk on the
[57:42] word was made flesh and dwed Among Us
[57:46] Praise the Lord amen the word was made
[57:50] flesh we know brother Bram spoke on
[57:52] there when he came from India and uh uh
[57:56] uh uh and then he he tied his Indian
[58:00] trip report with the manifestation of
[58:03] the super natural that took place in
[58:05] India he tied there to the word be made
[58:08] flesh and that's what it is whenever the
[58:11] word is manifested the word is made
[58:14] flesh when God Gave You Grace to be able
[58:17] to rebuke an evil thought is the word
[58:20] made flesh praise the Lord amen if you
[58:23] are struggling with a habit and God gave
[58:25] you Grace to rise above it is the word
[58:28] that is made flesh praise the Lord if
[58:31] you are sick and and and the grace of
[58:34] God come and and heal you is the word
[58:37] that is made flesh because that's the
[58:39] word that is promised that have done the
[58:41] healing in your
[58:43] body praise the Lord amen amen now I
[58:47] think I think uh uh uh with the thought
[58:51] of the word being made flesh we are
[58:53] looking to the day where our flesh will
[58:57] be constant word word word word word
[59:01] that's what we are looking to so because
[59:04] of that we don't we don't
[59:07] identify when the word is made flesh in
[59:10] us because we are looking to a
[59:13] sinless uh uh manifestation you know the
[59:17] word is made flesh now we are sinless we
[59:19] can't sin anymore we can't think uh evil
[59:22] thought anymore we are speaking things
[59:24] into existence then we think that is the
[59:26] word being made flesh but the truth
[59:29] about the matter de is that listen to
[59:31] this the Bible says Elijah was a man of
[59:35] lack passion so which mean he got sick
[59:39] amen he got
[59:42] tired he even got depressed that's
[59:45] right he's a man of like passion but
[59:49] when he stood on that mountain amen and
[59:53] says the god that answer by fire let it
[59:56] me God that was the word made
[1:00:00] flesh can you think about it after the
[1:00:03] word being made flesh yet he got a
[1:00:06] little bit intimidated and he was
[1:00:08] running
[1:00:09] away so it is it is it is it is we will
[1:00:13] come to that fullness but not
[1:00:16] now we will come to that fullness we
[1:00:19] will go in and out of of that
[1:00:22] manifestation but that's why we want to
[1:00:24] identify when whenever whenever the the
[1:00:29] grace of God comes upon
[1:00:31] you and and and you are just feeling so
[1:00:35] mad and something hates you no you don't
[1:00:38] have to Fe mad and then you are able to
[1:00:41] bring yourself on control that's the
[1:00:43] word being made
[1:00:46] flesh praise the
[1:00:48] Lord I mean when you are so tired and
[1:00:52] your body is tired and yet you can be
[1:00:55] able to to drag that tire body on your
[1:00:57] knees to pray is the word being made
[1:01:00] flesh we have to identify that we will
[1:01:04] go to a time where we are in a sinless
[1:01:08] condition not in this
[1:01:10] word okay not no sinless Perfection is
[1:01:14] not our Perfection our Perfection is to
[1:01:17] grow IM maturity better understanding
[1:01:20] and and you know and and and to be able
[1:01:23] to take the word and use it in the time
[1:01:26] of our
[1:01:28] frustration that's our
[1:01:30] Perfection so I I I I thought about this
[1:01:33] tonight I was actually looking at
[1:01:36] something when uh when when this uh uh
[1:01:39] exhortation came on my heart I said well
[1:01:41] okay I I'll share that a little bit
[1:01:43] couple of weeks ago I was listening to
[1:01:45] the message beyond the curtain of time
[1:01:47] and uh I I drew a little exhortation
[1:01:50] from there called nowhere like home I
[1:01:52] will speak on it sometime uh uh in the
[1:01:55] future nowhere like home and uh but when
[1:01:59] you when when we talk about the word may
[1:02:03] flesh the word may flesh think about it
[1:02:07] John in the beginning of his uh uh uh
[1:02:12] exhortation or presentation in the
[1:02:14] beginning was the
[1:02:16] word amen the word was with God when and
[1:02:21] and we all know that word was the
[1:02:24] logos amen and the logos was the first
[1:02:30] form that God took when he condescended
[1:02:34] from being
[1:02:36] Spirit are we together when he dropped
[1:02:39] down he condescended from being Spirit
[1:02:42] the first form he took was the
[1:02:45] logos a body of
[1:02:48] light that we call the pillow of fire
[1:02:51] you know we you know we can we we we can
[1:02:53] call it I mean different names but uh
[1:02:57] that was the form that that's what uh uh
[1:03:00] uh uh John is talking about here in the
[1:03:03] beginning was the
[1:03:05] word that word was with God and the Word
[1:03:08] was God now think about it now thou was
[1:03:12] the first expression of God thou was the
[1:03:16] first visible manifestation of God are
[1:03:20] we together amen amen now you got to
[1:03:23] follow me because I'm coming to you and
[1:03:25] I come to us all that was the first
[1:03:29] manifestation of
[1:03:32] God that was the first expression of God
[1:03:35] he was an invisible spirit that fill all
[1:03:39] time but for him to be visible he took a
[1:03:43] form and that form was the logos called
[1:03:47] the word are we together
[1:03:51] amen and from that form that was the
[1:03:55] first
[1:03:57] and the
[1:03:58] last manifestation of God was
[1:04:02] flesh
[1:04:04] right think about it now
[1:04:07] amen his first
[1:04:10] manifestation was
[1:04:13] light his last manifestation was
[1:04:18] flesh are we together amen praise the
[1:04:23] Lord now
[1:04:26] every one of us
[1:04:28] year every one of us for us to be
[1:04:31] existent for us to be alive we were in
[1:04:34] God's
[1:04:36] thought are we together amen we were in
[1:04:39] his mind and being in his mind we were
[1:04:43] all spiritan we were all in a form of
[1:04:48] thought are we together amen we were all
[1:04:52] in a form of
[1:04:53] thought and and and uh when God taught
[1:04:57] to express
[1:05:00] us that's why we have birth
[1:05:03] dates and that's why some people are
[1:05:05] very particular about their
[1:05:08] birthday they are very very particular
[1:05:10] about their birthday it hurt them if you
[1:05:13] don't say happy
[1:05:15] birthday and it's important it's
[1:05:19] important you you you'll soon grab where
[1:05:21] I'm going with that with that uh uh uh
[1:05:26] statement I just made now so when God
[1:05:30] taught to express us he placed every one
[1:05:34] of us in a set age time year months days
[1:05:38] that we will be
[1:05:40] born and uh uh we came to the
[1:05:45] Earth uh and then uh uh we were born our
[1:05:49] birthed but we we came in flesh now if
[1:05:53] you go back to Genesis 1
[1:05:56] you will realize that the Bible says and
[1:05:59] God made Man In His
[1:06:01] Image okay so when Adam was first made
[1:06:06] he was made in a
[1:06:08] form of we all we always say he was a
[1:06:12] spirit man but he was made in a form
[1:06:17] of uh a
[1:06:20] light because he was in the image of God
[1:06:24] praise the Lord
[1:06:26] now question and answer in Genesis I
[1:06:28] didn't put all all of that together
[1:06:30] tonight but if you look there you will
[1:06:31] realize brother brandham says we all we
[1:06:34] were we were
[1:06:36] attributes playing around the Throne of
[1:06:39] the father okay as simple example of
[1:06:43] that on the date of
[1:06:45] Pentecost all of them that were in the
[1:06:47] upper room had a light on their
[1:06:51] head the Holy Ghost came down in a form
[1:06:54] of light that was over their head are we
[1:06:58] together praise the Lord amen amen so we
[1:07:02] all have that it is just not visible to
[1:07:06] our eyes but we have it when you have
[1:07:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have
[1:07:11] that now
[1:07:13] so what I'm going with this is that uh I
[1:07:18] want us to be able to
[1:07:20] appreciate why God put us in flesh amen
[1:07:25] amen amen why we were put in flesh
[1:07:29] because let me tell you when we get to
[1:07:32] heaven the God that you are
[1:07:35] worshiping the one you going to see
[1:07:37] there is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:42] amen in a
[1:07:45] body that will be just like your
[1:07:51] body praise the
[1:07:53] Lord amen we will never go back to be
[1:07:57] Spirit again right
[1:08:00] no the body the flesh is the final bus
[1:08:07] stop we come through time we came from
[1:08:10] talks We Came as attributes we were we
[1:08:13] were we were in our father laws we were
[1:08:16] we were uh uh uh in his blood we can say
[1:08:20] all of that but when we are manifested
[1:08:22] in
[1:08:23] flesh we don't go back to being
[1:08:29] Spirit now you will see that's the
[1:08:31] reason
[1:08:33] why that expression of man was attacked
[1:08:37] that's the reason why the greatest
[1:08:39] battle ever fought is fought in this
[1:08:45] body praise the Lord
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:51] amen that's the reason why the greatest
[1:08:53] B ever fought is fought in this in this
[1:08:57] in this body that we are in that's why
[1:09:00] we we we fight our battles
[1:09:02] here is
[1:09:04] because uh uh the devil knows that uh
[1:09:08] this is what God needs to express
[1:09:11] himself a body will thou prepare
[1:09:15] me what body is that is this
[1:09:21] body praise the
[1:09:23] Lord you know we can we can we can take
[1:09:26] it up to the body of our Lord Jesus when
[1:09:29] you read Hebrew and see what Paul was
[1:09:32] saying he quoted something David said in
[1:09:34] the psalm but you will realize that uh
[1:09:39] uh we will look look at some few
[1:09:42] scriptures tonight before we close this
[1:09:43] talk you will you will realize that uh
[1:09:47] God
[1:09:49] desire his desire was to be made flesh
[1:09:54] his desire
[1:09:55] was to express himself that's the reason
[1:09:59] why brother Brandon would tell us you
[1:10:02] know uh uh he had all of these
[1:10:05] attributes as abilities in him as a
[1:10:08] Healer as a deliverer as a savior but
[1:10:12] there is no way he could have done it if
[1:10:14] we were just talks in his mind he had to
[1:10:18] express Us in
[1:10:22] flesh praise the Lord
[1:10:25] he had to express Us in
[1:10:29] flesh even when a sin pass away they
[1:10:33] don't go to be in spirit they take on
[1:10:36] another
[1:10:38] body they are not just floating Spirit
[1:10:41] no they take on another body Paul told
[1:10:44] us in uh uh uh uh in the book of
[1:10:47] Corinthian you know and and that's that
[1:10:50] was the blessing of him going to the 10
[1:10:52] Heavens to be able to understand that
[1:10:55] that there are Celestial body
[1:10:57] terrestrial body and glorified
[1:11:02] body so we will always be in the body
[1:11:06] amen amen praise the Lord amen we will
[1:11:09] always be in the body and whether you
[1:11:11] like it or
[1:11:14] not the celestial body is a
[1:11:19] flesh it's not
[1:11:22] Stone if you read Corinthian you will
[1:11:25] see where Paul talks about there is a
[1:11:28] flesh for fish a flesh for bird he make
[1:11:31] us to understand that there are certain
[1:11:33] flesh you can eat there are certain
[1:11:35] flesh that are not good to
[1:11:39] eat trying to give us an understanding
[1:11:42] that just like this terrestrial body is
[1:11:45] a flesh it can be failed that's the same
[1:11:49] way the celestial body can be fail
[1:11:51] brother Brandon behind the curtain of
[1:11:53] time he says they embra R me he said but
[1:11:56] the strange thing there was that there
[1:11:58] was no himo sensation when all of these
[1:12:00] sisters were running to me saying oh my
[1:12:02] beloved brother my beloved
[1:12:06] brother that was the first thing now you
[1:12:09] think about it he was he was in another
[1:12:11] B but yet he was
[1:12:14] thinking that I'm not feeling human
[1:12:17] sensation what is happening all this
[1:12:20] thing feels so good no
[1:12:23] lust amen
[1:12:26] he said no I don't want to go back to
[1:12:28] that body I don't want to go back to
[1:12:31] that body because the feeling of this
[1:12:33] body is different from the feeling of
[1:12:36] that
[1:12:41] body are we together amen so you see the
[1:12:46] word
[1:12:47] travel a travel from a
[1:12:50] thought but it's final resting place
[1:12:53] it's final Tabernacle it's a
[1:12:57] flesh praise the Lord amen that the the
[1:13:01] flesh is the final Tabernacle for the
[1:13:06] word the word that is being preached to
[1:13:09] you it is not just to be a Bible we
[1:13:12] carry on our arm a tape that we listen
[1:13:15] to the sole purpose of this word is to
[1:13:18] Tabernacle in this flesh amen that's
[1:13:21] what the word is aing for amen amen
[1:13:24] praise the Lord amen and because the
[1:13:27] devil knows that he's not going to give
[1:13:29] your flesh a chance
[1:13:32] amen praise the
[1:13:34] Lord he's not going to give your flesh a
[1:13:37] chance he's going to blast your mind I
[1:13:40] mean sometimes you come from honor h h a
[1:13:43] good experience of the word or or
[1:13:46] praying a good atmosphere of worship you
[1:13:49] are just feeling and then suddenly
[1:13:51] something you know uh uh brother

[1:13:56] brother uh his brother Tony that used to
[1:14:00] be with him uh one time his brother was

[1:14:09] uh his brother told him that uh he said
[1:14:15] B I can't do

[1:16:33] the body that he he have just brought
[1:16:37] such a pressure confusion h h h h
[1:16:41] identity
[1:16:43] crisis and man has become so perverted

[1:20:32] Tabernacle in the
[1:20:34] body that is the greatest expression
[1:20:38] like Paul said in Hebrew he is the
[1:20:41] expressed image of the invisible God

[1:20:48] himself then he comes down and heal your
[1:20:51] body when an invisible God want to
[1:20:53] express himself then he comes down and

[1:21:49] redeem you because he want to Tabernacle
[1:21:52] your body
[1:21:55] you see that is the reason why Jesus
[1:21:58] Christ became a type of the Tabernacle
[1:22:01] from the beginning God start telling the
[1:22:03] children of Israel build a tabernacle
[1:22:06] because I want to come down and dwell
[1:22:09] among
[1:22:12] you but he will not dwell in a temple M
[1:22:15] with
[1:22:17] hands he was giving him an
[1:22:20] idea look people I have chose you to be
[1:22:23] a peculiar people because I want to
[1:22:25] Tabernacle your body you are made for an
[1:22:29] expression for God to express his
[1:22:36] desires praise the
[1:22:38] Lord if there's one thing that that uh
[1:22:41] we must think about every morning is how
[1:22:44] am I going to express God
[1:22:46] today praise the Lord amen now I'm going
[1:22:51] to that job I'll meet that manager don't
[1:22:53] worry about the manager the manager is

[1:22:58] he's just pressing your button for you
[1:23:00] to express
[1:23:05] God the
[1:23:07] word being made
[1:23:09] flesh praise the Lord the religious word
[1:23:14] want to make that to stop in
[1:23:18] Jesus but a prophet has come and let us
[1:23:21] know that you are the word made flesh
[1:23:27] praise the
[1:23:28] Lord with Jesus the world was made flesh
[1:23:32] in one man in his
[1:23:35] fullness the word was tabernacled in him
[1:23:38] but now God has broke himself
[1:23:42] up he has broke himself up in as many
[1:23:46] pieces as many that are saved This
[1:23:49] Promise is unto you and to your children
[1:23:52] and to as many as the Lord our God God
[1:23:54] shall
[1:23:56] call so God has break himself he have
[1:23:59] distributed himself so he can be
[1:24:10] Express praise the
[1:24:20] Lord I was listening to a testimony
[1:24:24] of
[1:24:26] uh uh K you if you remember uh the lady
[1:24:30] that uh saved bunch of Jewish people
[1:24:33] during the time of the Holocaust she was
[1:24:35] testifying listening to one of her
[1:24:36] testimony she was talking about uh uh uh
[1:24:40] she she had a cold she was sick and she
[1:24:44] was just sneezing and coughing and and
[1:24:46] uh uh and and then then this young
[1:24:49] Christian woman told her that uh you
[1:24:52] know uh uh uh you know ref her back to
[1:24:55] the
[1:24:56] scripture you know how uh Paul pray over
[1:25:00] handkerchiefs you know Paul pray over
[1:25:03] handkerchiefs and uh uh you know in
[1:25:06] April so the she told her that uh uh you
[1:25:11] you you need a handkerchief or or the
[1:25:13] Lord is going to give you a handkerchief
[1:25:15] you know you uh you know as the
[1:25:17] testimony will go but what was
[1:25:20] miraculous in that is
[1:25:23] there uh uh you know I think it was the
[1:25:27] next day or in the same week or so uh a
[1:25:30] lady came by to see her and uh she have
[1:25:34] just uh bought some fabrics and and she
[1:25:38] sold handkerchief to distribute to give
[1:25:42] out now this lady was talking you know
[1:25:46] uh uh uh encouraging this woman on the
[1:25:48] promise of Paul praying on aprons and
[1:25:52] handkerchiefs you know that uh you know
[1:25:55] uh as a prayer club we call the prayer
[1:25:57] club and uh and here said that uh on the
[1:26:02] other hand here is another woman that
[1:26:04] was just burden as I mean uh uh uh with
[1:26:08] uh with a good heart to make buy a you
[1:26:10] know she bought a fabric and she just
[1:26:12] make handker ship you know she cruciate
[1:26:15] and in her mind she thought about this
[1:26:18] woman she said I have to give her
[1:26:21] one praise the Lord
[1:26:25] and then the next day the uh uh you know
[1:26:29] the lady came and came to hard and and
[1:26:32] and and gave her and she asked the
[1:26:35] woman did you knew that I need a
[1:26:37] handkerchief she said no I never had no
[1:26:39] idea about that I just bought these fa
[1:26:43] breaks and I was making I was making
[1:26:45] handkerchiefs and and I thought of you I
[1:26:47] thought of you to give you
[1:26:49] one praise the Lord and she said
[1:26:55] that thing blew her mind and make that
[1:26:59] scripture so real to
[1:27:03] her that here is another sister
[1:27:08] encouraging her in the
[1:27:10] scripture looking at the place in the
[1:27:13] scripture where you know uh uh the
[1:27:16] Apostle Paul pray over aprons and
[1:27:18] handkerchiefs and give it to the sick
[1:27:21] and and and Y said in the same time
[1:27:24] another woman is burden completely not
[1:27:27] even uh you know thinking about the
[1:27:29] scripture but she just but yet the two
[1:27:32] just came
[1:27:35] together praise the Lord yet the two
[1:27:38] just came together you see that is the
[1:27:41] reason why in the scripture when brother
[1:27:43] brandham said uh H H uh Moses was a type
[1:27:47] of Christ it was not all the life of
[1:27:51] Moses no he was only a type of Christ
[1:27:55] where the word was made
[1:27:58] flesh because he had a peculiar birth he
[1:28:02] was a type of Christ he was born a
[1:28:05] deliverer he was a type of
[1:28:08] Christ praise the
[1:28:10] Lord it was not all of his life if that
[1:28:14] is not a
[1:28:16] type Joseph was a type of
[1:28:20] Christ when he told a li you know what
[1:28:23] he he was not that was not a type of
[1:28:25] Christ and that is the same thing with
[1:28:30] us when the word anoint us like the
[1:28:35] preacher was saying on Sunday when the
[1:28:37] word anoint us let me use that word when
[1:28:40] it anoint us and we stand for truth and
[1:28:43] we stand for
[1:28:45] righteousness in that moment is the word
[1:28:48] being made
[1:28:50] flesh why because the word has anointed
[1:28:53] you to be
[1:28:55] decent praise the Lord amen so the
[1:29:00] promise of uh uh uh uh what the Apostle
[1:29:04] says women dressing decent the word has
[1:29:07] anointed you for you to be
[1:29:10] decent you see that's the reason why
[1:29:13] when all of these pressure comes and
[1:29:15] people think oh you know uh uh I'm old
[1:29:19] I'm not enjoying my life I'm not how
[1:29:21] much how much how much time do you have
[1:29:24] to enjoy this
[1:29:25] flesh how much time do you
[1:29:29] have how much time do you really have to
[1:29:32] enjoy this
[1:29:33] flesh if it was just uh h a time of
[1:29:37] dancing it we just let's let let's just
[1:29:40] let's just have a Dance I mean how long
[1:29:42] are you going to dance on no time you
[1:29:47] tired praise the
[1:29:49] Lord even the people that go out to have
[1:29:51] fun before the fun begin they are drunk
[1:29:55] just from the beginning of the fun they
[1:29:56] are
[1:29:59] drunk so how much time do we have to
[1:30:02] really enjoy this
[1:30:04] flesh there is no better way that this
[1:30:07] flesh can come to is full potential than
[1:30:11] when the word is expressed in
[1:30:16] it praise the
[1:30:19] Lord amen there is no better you you
[1:30:23] just think about about it you you you
[1:30:25] will realize there uh uh uh you know
[1:30:28] when you just fall into that place where
[1:30:31] you just do something and you are happy
[1:30:35] it overshadow all of your
[1:30:42] day you get to the grocery store and you
[1:30:45] open the door and the lady say thank you
[1:30:47] God bless you you say God bless you
[1:30:49] too you just you just feel fine
[1:30:55] praise the
[1:30:59] Lord just that simple
[1:31:03] actart make you to feel
[1:31:06] fine just the simple art of seeing a
[1:31:09] struggling person and you and and you
[1:31:11] don't fall in that channel to condemn
[1:31:13] them you just feel a burden to pray for
[1:31:16] them they stay on your mind and you feel
[1:31:21] good that you saw the struggling person
[1:31:24] and you fed a burden to pray for them
[1:31:27] you feel
[1:31:29] good but brand T it like this he said he
[1:31:33] said uh uh uh he used Samson story you
[1:31:36] know the raer that Samson gave gave the
[1:31:39] the the the Philistine he says out of
[1:31:41] out of the strong came the
[1:31:44] sweet he said it like this he
[1:31:47] said when when you know to do good when
[1:31:52] you had have an opportunity
[1:31:54] to do what is right he says when you do
[1:31:57] it you feel good about it he said the
[1:32:00] opposite also when you know that you
[1:32:03] supposed to you at least you supposed to
[1:32:06] be a Christian in that
[1:32:08] moment and you don't you you feel bad I
[1:32:12] mean the old devil going to beat you
[1:32:14] with that say you
[1:32:16] believer you sitting now in the filter
[1:32:18] conversation you you even laughing
[1:32:24] I mean he's going to whipe you and
[1:32:27] you're just going to feel
[1:32:28] bad why because your body has been
[1:32:32] redeemed to express Christ and in that
[1:32:36] moment it was not an expression of
[1:32:38] Christ so you know you do what you
[1:32:41] become just like Peter he goes
[1:32:43] crying because what he have denied the
[1:32:47] Lord he goes
[1:32:51] weeping most of the time that's the way
[1:32:53] we feel feel when we find ourself doing
[1:32:56] things that we're not supposed to do you
[1:32:58] feel bad you just oh god oh Lord when
[1:33:01] with this oh Father I'm tired why
[1:33:04] because you feel like you betray the
[1:33:07] word what make you to feel like
[1:33:12] that because your body has been redeemed
[1:33:15] it has been brought through a process
[1:33:18] that it should start expressing
[1:33:20] Christ on the opposite when you do what
[1:33:24] is right you feel good you feel good
[1:33:28] about it that you you just feel a a a a
[1:33:32] happy presence in you and you just want
[1:33:35] to keep
[1:33:37] it praise the Lord you feel so happy in
[1:33:40] you you just want to keep it but that
[1:33:42] Old Devil comes around and he start
[1:33:45] throwing things at you just to get you
[1:33:47] this stop before you realize man my
[1:33:52] goodness why did will really attack me
[1:33:55] just
[1:34:00] now I see what I'm going with
[1:34:03] this praise the Lord I told you it's
[1:34:06] it's just an
[1:34:09] exhortation just to to help us to
[1:34:13] realize because many of the
[1:34:16] time Christians we become so
[1:34:20] lazy the battle is the Lord
[1:34:24] that's why we
[1:34:25] say but he have also trained Your Hands
[1:34:28] to
[1:34:31] War praise the
[1:34:33] Lord he have carried you through one
[1:34:35] trial or
[1:34:37] another he have trained you to war so
[1:34:41] when situation are coming up you have to
[1:34:43] stand your
[1:34:45] ground praise the
[1:34:47] Lord you having Legions of angels that
[1:34:52] are around you but you see they cannot
[1:34:55] work they only work on your
[1:34:57] will when your will is not in position
[1:35:00] of the word they are not going to go
[1:35:02] against the word when your will is in
[1:35:06] position of the word then they come and
[1:35:07] strengthen
[1:35:08] you you just feel a presence of
[1:35:12] boldness it's not you being bold I was
[1:35:16] very bold no those were just angels that
[1:35:18] were bumping you up they are standing
[1:35:21] behind you why because you are standing
[1:35:23] for the word you are expressing the
[1:35:29] word angels will never join you to
[1:35:32] betray the word they know what what
[1:35:34] happened to them when Satan deceived
[1:35:36] them they will never join you to betray
[1:35:39] the word when you are betraying the word
[1:35:41] they will just fold their
[1:35:45] hands praise the Lord when you are
[1:35:47] standing for the word it comes right
[1:35:49] behind
[1:35:50] it praise the Lord then you just feel
[1:35:53] feel that boldness you just feel that
[1:35:55] little
[1:35:56] sense you think about all of those all
[1:35:59] of those uh Saints in the Dark Ages they
[1:36:02] never knew the revelation of Jesus
[1:36:04] Christ they never knew all the mystery
[1:36:06] but when there was a Gallow that was
[1:36:08] waiting for them when there was a fire
[1:36:10] that was waiting for them there was
[1:36:13] something that took them with boldness
[1:36:16] and braveness to embrace it they were
[1:36:19] accompanied by angels
[1:36:25] praise the
[1:36:28] Lord I mean so let's not just give our
[1:36:32] body over to
[1:36:33] sickness no the body was redeemed for
[1:36:38] the word to be expressed you have to
[1:36:40] fight don't just give your body over to
[1:36:43] some kind of a foolish habit that my
[1:36:45] weakness what make it your weakness when
[1:36:47] did you buy it where you got it from
[1:36:54] if you wake up every
[1:36:56] morning and the Lord remind you that I
[1:36:59] share my blood I I pay the price of
[1:37:03] redemption I bought this body because I
[1:37:05] was looking for the man I was looking
[1:37:07] for the woman in this evil age that will
[1:37:10] stand for
[1:37:18] me praise the Lord that's why we were
[1:37:21] redeemed
[1:37:23] we will redeem for the word to be made
[1:37:25] flesh God want his word to be made
[1:37:29] flesh even in your home he want the word
[1:37:32] to be me
[1:37:34] flesh praise the
[1:37:37] Lord that's why it has to start from the
[1:37:41] home at our job he want the word to be
[1:37:44] made flesh because he know the darkness
[1:37:47] just like the prophet say gross darkness
[1:37:49] is upon the people he want you to be
[1:37:52] that little
[1:37:54] light that little
[1:37:56] light like the preacher said you are
[1:37:59] peculiar they don't understand why you
[1:38:00] are the way you
[1:38:02] are praise the Lord they all talk back
[1:38:05] in the
[1:38:07] corner she's just old faction she

[1:38:17] murmuring when they come to their renes
[1:38:20] they appreciate you I wish I can be like
[1:38:23] her
[1:38:25] she's
[1:38:27] decent he's a
[1:38:37] gentleman that's why the prophet of God
[1:38:39] said he have no hands but our hands he
[1:38:43] have no feet but our feet those are not
[1:38:47] just saying so so you can feel sorry for
[1:38:50] him and give your life no
