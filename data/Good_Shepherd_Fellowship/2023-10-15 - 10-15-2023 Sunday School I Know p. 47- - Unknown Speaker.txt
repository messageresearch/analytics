========================================

[Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] God said among them Hallelujah trou produced the son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave but not until they went into the fire did that comforter appear it was Daniel who had purposed in his heart that he not defile himself with the things of the world I was forced to whether he' pray to God or go to the LI but was heat was put on and he was thr into a lion after that he saw the angel the lording in the midst of keeping away that great Pillar of Fire standing between him and the Lions and the Lions could not get him because he had went through the trials and temptations and troubles he knew that his God was able to deliver him from oh Hallelujah it was Abraham after he had seen the ground get Barren and the drought come and lock separate himself and go down to live deliciously into the world is actually he had hear the whines and cries of of his herdsman for no grass far his cattle but he maintained in the land that God gave him and told him to soier in Hallelujah as on that day after he had been tried till his his patience was at the end was on that day that that when after the trial was over he spoke face to face with Elohim the O that day Hallelujah after he had suffered his trials after he had went through the troubles that he had been through that God appeared to him in the form of a man and sat there and told him he was married and his wife's name was Sarah and said she laughed at him in the tent behind it was there that Abraham called him Elohim yes am after the trial and tribulation oh if the church could only wait to itself today to find that after the troubles and trials and L and made fun of the things the church has been through the Pentecostal church that we see God in our midst doing great signs and wonders praise after the TOs and Troubles of day after it's all passed then we shall see Jesus Jesus At Last Hallelujah he will be waiting for me Jesus so fair and true on his beautiful Throne he will welcome us home after the day is through while it's day let us labor all these great men that would take much of our morning service away to go into mention that they went through trials and saw God they went through trials and saw angels they went through trials and Revelations and saw signs and wonders and things but oh none of them saw what job saw all them man after seeing angels and seeing God and all these things they never saw nothing to give them hopes beyond the grave but job saw the resurrection he saw Easter he saw the thing that comforts every heart amen then when he did all that my words would be printed in a book oh that they would be engraved with an iron tin in the Rock see everything had turned against him his even his servants wouldn't speak to him his wife was a stranger there he set on the ash that great Tri in the church come and turn their back to him for seven days and no one to comfort him then he must have saw the vision of Easter when he cried I know my redeemer liveth and the last days he'll stand on the earth praise the Lord I know oh that my words were pinned with an iron pin and a stone that my words could never fade no more for I know my redeemer liveth I know I know what do you know job I know Oh My Redeemer liveth did you notice Not only was there someone living but he was a redeemer to job oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm so glad that I'm part of Easter that I'm part of that resurrection and we are part of it this morning because in US dwells that Resurrection Life that is the partaker had brought Easter I know that my red rer what do you know I'm not guessing at it we got too much guessing today I know my redeemer liveth amen yes sir now what was he if he lived he was a redeemer to job my personal my My Redeemer liveth and what else do you know joob what did you see in that vision and at the last days he shall stand on the Earth yeah and though the skin worms destroys my body yet in my flesh I shall see God who I shall see for myself I know my redeemer liveth and he will stand at the last day upon the Earth though my rains be consumed within me though the skin worms destroys my body yet in my flesh I shall seek God D that was the greatest vision Daniel saw an angel the Hebrew children saw the Son of God Amen Noah saw the rainbow Abraham seen God face to face but job saw the resurrection amen job looked forward all the Patriarchs and great Saints of the Bible look forward to that day with an assurance through their Visions through their Revelations that there would come a time of Resurrection now we see great works go on we we see great powers of God we see great things that he could do you couldn't look at the Sun and know that it isn't the power of God that brings that world around over that sun you couldn't see a springtime come without knowing there was a God you can see healing of blind eyes deaf ears no it's godone but what if that was all there was and after we died we was gone but the Resurrection the Easter oh that's what sealed everything that God everything promise was a resurrection and they have to have a crucifixion before you can have a resurrection and before the church will ever be able to see a resurrected power before I can ever see a new ministry take place myself before you can ever enter into a new fellowship with God there's got to be a self crucifixion so that there can come a resurrection amen help us Lord we've got to die out to our own thoughts die out to our own ways amen die out to everything that's around us go through the trials and tribulations that we might see a new Resurrection a new life amen before a sinner can ever become a Christian there has to come a death then a resurrection amen before Abraham could see Elohim there had to be 25 years of testing before the Hebrew children could see the Son of God they had to go into a fiery furnace before Daniel could see an angel he had to go into the Lion's Den before job could ever see the resurrection he had to go in and lose everything he had but then our vision he saw and if joob by Vision could stand so firmly Upon A Promise how much more ought we to do after Christ is raised from the dead and become the first fruits of those that slept and sent back the Holy Spirit as a seal of Promise upon us that we too shall live because I live you live also Hall seeing his great presence among us working doing the same signs and wonders that he did on Earth giving us a hopes and we come to the resurrection and then remain on our eyes sheeps let's get off the I sheep today with a new vision with a new power with a new determination that we see God in this power we see the resurrection of the things coming we're at the time of death we're setting in the doors of death the Nations is in the doors of death Russia has discovered a new weapon now as you all heard on the radio and things they don't have to come over here and blow it up with a bomb they can just bring a little something over here get amongst their spies and sprad a little stuff out in the nation and everybody will be paralyzed for 24 Hours come over and when you wake up there's a Russian kicking you to the side a big Russian guard taking over your home ravishing your wife throwing your children out in the street and taking your home they can do it they wouldn't lose one thing they got it nobody knows what it is see everything working up in now they can use that and not be afraid of it because no one else has it we don't know how it will come what will take place but we know one thing that we're on the as sheep the nation's on the as sheep the world's on the ash sheep and because the world is on an ash sheep I'm so glad that the spirit of God can come and we can say I know my redeemer live at the last he stand upon this Earth day he will come no one of the poet wrote living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away Rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day amen it taken a Gethsemane of drops of blood breaking through his skin before there and it taken a cruel Agony of Calvary before there could come the proof of an eternal God who could raise the dead up it taken a it taken a guest Simon in a Calvary to make an Easter it certainly did how the those Apostles upon that morning when they were so discouraged until Peter said I am so discouraged I believe I'll just go back and fishing again I'll go back down I I seen him they had Great Hopes and believed and everything until it come that great darkening place what was God doing he was bringing those Apostles to an as sheep he was bringing them to a place to where they would they would have their faith confirmed to them and Peter said I'm I have seen do great Miracles down on Galilee but oh he lays Yonder dead and cold in the Tomb I believe I just go down to the Sea this morning and cast in a net and just go fishing maybe I can look out across the sea I and I find out I remember seeing him when he waited for us at the bank I believe I'll just go down the Apostle said you know what I believe I'll just go with you oh they were blue they cried until their eyes were swollen how we know to go through those places how we know we're all acquainted with those things I remember when I laid a precious one y in the grave up on top of the hill y called the Easter of the walart Ridge Cemetery I laid a little baby in there and I'd Crown a mother's arm I'd cry till I couldn't cry no more I'd done everything that I know till i' took a gun to try to commit suicide I was in such a time it was at that hour in that little room up there on my knees that the heavens open back saw her standing there Amen in the splend of immortality praise God it was in that hour that I fell her arms come around my shoulder and said bill you don't understand we're so much better off than you see it takes a crucifixion it takes a crushing of a flower to bring perfume from it it takes a crushing of a life to get the best out of it that there is that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was he can not stand before the crucifixion say all power in heavens and earth is given in my hands but actually after the crucifixion he could stand and say all powers of heavens and earth into my hand but what did it do it taken crucifixion first it taken the crushing and the disappointing of the Apostles it seen their savior the one they had loveed and seen him even raise up the Dead from the from the grave they seen him do that and think there he lays cold in the grave himself this morning it taken to those people who had seen him Open the Eyes of the blind seen perceive the very thoughts that was in the people's hearts how didn't he know they say that them were coming after him how did he know why didn't he know Jud Judas would would betray him why did he know the soldiers were coming up the mountains there with staves and swords and everything to get him if he could perceive their thoughts see the devil was working on them putting them on an as sheep father they want to give them a testimony of I no not I guess or perhaps it's so I know amen I know and remember those trials are brought up on you the same way so that you're not say well maybe this is right maybe the scriptures is true maybe Divine Healing is right maybe the Holy Ghost is right but when you get that experience and come off that ass sheep and you get the revelation of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can scream I know my redeemer liveth because he lives in me Peter said I'll go fishing the Apostle said I believe I'll just go with you and there was on their ass sheep down there in the midst of the Sea and the trouble going on the way it was and I can hear one of them say oh how could it happen Peter how could it be such a thing that a man like that could die how could he be put into the grave the way he was how could he stand to let him spit in his face and jerk beard out put that crown on his head how could he do that oh and still be God I just can't understand it oh what a disappointment all of a sudden they looked over on the the bank just the same kind of a revelation job got there they seen what job seen 4,000 years before there stood the Redeemer alive and fresh standing on the bank with the far made fish cooked on it like that and said invite him Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people coming dying with his Mana he does feed and supplies our every need or just sweet to up with Jesus all the time amen how we can think that how they taken those great things how that the Paul the Apostle that great Apostle who had been through his time of trouble when he witnessed the death of Stevens and seen his little face look towards heaven and the Rocks beating him in the face and he looked up and he said I see the heavens open I see Jesus standing on the right hand of God he said Lord lay not this sin to their charge and Paul holding the coat that had put him for weeks after weeks up on the as sheep walking back and forth till his mind had been polluted until he was on his road down to Damascus to try to fight it way out like a man going into a whiskey bottle to try to drown his Sorrows he was in the midst of that when there come a voice from Heaven the great Shining Light said Saul Saul I persecuted s be he saw him he recognized him that he was a resurrected Jesus the one that he had witnessed of dying was raised again oh I can remember my own life on the road down to destruction when I heard a sweet voice I am Jesus I was once dead I'm alive forever more because I live you can live also since that time put my hand in his I've trusted him through the Dark Places when the time has come where I can't see which way I'm going I still trust him every Christian believer has to be pushed into those trials every Christian believer has to be put on the a sheep so that he can come forth with an experience amen I know my redeemer liveing we don't come here this morning just to sit and talk about some historical Affair which is all true but we come here with a testimony this morning I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I know beyond any Shadow doubt I know that he raised from the dead and he lives within me today he is mine and I am his I am a j Heir with him in the kingdom of God Amen Easter Easter brings a great thing Resurrection A New Hope have you got it this morning is it in your heart do you know that your Redeemer liveth and he makes all things work together you say brother Bram I'm sitting here waiting for the prayer line God's working at just exactly for the good why was that precious little boy the other day strick and blind when he was born that God might get glory and turn a city upside down sure God knows what he's doing God knows and he puts us on the ash sheep in order to show us his his glory so this morning I say this friend after 31 years of ministry after 31 years of TOS of the field I want to make my testimony to this I've seen disappointments I've seen the time I've asked for things and cried for things and beg for things and fail to get them but if I'll just wait patiently upon God then I know that it works just exactly right comes out just exactly right does just exactly the right thing I lost my baby my little Sharon how that's one thing that stumbled me I said how can that be for the good how can it be for the good months later when I seen her stand there and all the beauty of a young girl speaking to me standing by the side of that Old Wagon broken down there I noticed she would live she might have turned out wrong God had to take her while she was tender and sweet I know I'll see her again I know I shall see her I know it Beyond any Shadow of Doubt I think of my wife of 2 2 years old taking just merely a girl a little mother there when the papers give a headline here a young mother Reverend just dies oh I my heart bled I didn't know what to do but today I know it was all working for my good I know the life had to be ground and twisted and squeezed to get what in it was out there was too much brandom in there it had to be squeezed out before God could make knowing there was too much of you and you told God had to squeeze it out through trials and while I squeez is coming on it's hard but after a while the sky is cleared back and you see the purpose of God then you cry I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God these little trials and things are just for a moment they fade and pass away but they're only done for your good let us remember that that God would get Glory shall we bow our heads just a moment I want to ask before prayer is there any here would like to be remembered in a word of prayer before we uh close God bless you how many in here would say I want God in the hour of my trial now to give to me a new experience that I can come forth New Again raise your hand say I want I want this to be a resurrection for me a Easter to resurrect me in new hopes new powers new health and New Joy the Lord bless you my dear people oh our God and our savior we are so grateful to thee for this Easter for what it means to our hearts and by faith Over Yonder across the land we can see the coming of the Lord Jesus as he's making hisself ready now putting on his kingly garments and the church is putting on the bridegroom putting on her wedding gown there's fixing to be a great meeting pretty soon this ass sheep can't stand forever when we're hearing people laughing making fun of us and calling us that scandalous name of holy rollers and making fun of us and say that we're not even mentally right oh it can't last all the time Lord but let us be job hold our testimony let us be as Daniel at the Lion's Den or the Hebrew children at the fire furnace or Abraham any Journey help us oh Lord to stand true until we see that great thing take place when the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise we which alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye then will come that Easter for us that Christ enjoyed some 1900 years ago this morning and said because I live you live also this same Jesus that was taken up from the midst of us shall come back just the way he went we shall see him even every scar in his hand and every Thorn print on his head we shall see him oh I shall know him I shall know him and Redeemed by his side I shall stand yes Lord my poor heart as it this feeble body of mine begins to bend beneath the load the Cs and TOS of the Harvest Fields the mission fields and the ups and towns and the indifference between irrate ministers and so forth across the place and the people scarning and evil Powers oh Lord someday we're coming like Elijah down to the river look over there harness every Bush a CH of fire that'll pack us away let us know that these as sheeps are only veils to hide us from that great thing that just lays ahead that great Glory may we remain true like job until we can see him face to face may we be as true as our Lord was as our example to go to Calvary to ready to be crucified to be crucified with him that there might be a resurrection in our life Grant it Lord May if there be any scorners here that was like Paul of old that's made fun may they find a Easter on their Road home this morning Grant it Lord we pray Lord that those that are on the as sheep of Destruction as keep up sickness that this will be the hour that they will be delivered last night speaking to that little woman out at the trailer and her husband how that yonder in Phoenix in a serious condition those big cancers laying up there on them and now today is perfectly well and normal and the little baby that was going to have its heart taken out sets here in the building this morning normal well a little blind boy that once walked in the darkness and never see daylight walks today day and sees the light of day and oh God how we thank you for this and it's all looking Beyond the Veil to that great day of Resurrection granted father let them know that these things had to be that way that these little blind boy could see that the little child having heart trouble might give a testimony to others all these things work around together for good to them love you all made possible to us because there was one obedient in trial there was one stood the test that was Jesus the one who is so obedient to the father till the father raised him up on Easter morning because it was not possible that he should be holding of death for I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell for he was found faithful always doing that which pleased the father God may we ever be faithful at the post of Duty no matter what our trials is and our troubles what I may we be able to say always I know that all things work together for good to them at love God granted father we bless these people this morning with th blessings they've come early from their places they've come to the Tabernacle they've come to get Comfort may they go home this morning with the power of the Holy Ghost burning in their hearts walking along the road like those coming from EMAs said did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way granted father I commit them to thee now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen all right brother n i remember the services we won't have prayer cards this morning because that if we have prayer cards as long as I get them people stand here like that I'll still rely upon that gift I've got to have a place to I lay that aside where I can walk out here and I'm afraid I seem to be a scared I'm afraid I'll make a mistake to lose a battle is not lose a war had lost several battles but he never lost a war that's righty and we'll lose lots of battles too but we'll not lose the war I'll make many mistakes but I won't lose the cause God gave it and God will take care of it it's a it's anointing and I it's time I believe the hour is and I'm beginning being this Easter this day I'm going go to go along like I did there praying for the sick if I can it's anointing if something has to happen within me I'm not too used to it it comes in such a way I maybe not be able to detect it just right but I've got to keep going at it until I do know it every time so this will be the day that I'll try but the grace of God the Lord bless you now brother Neville and the services will be begin at [Music] 9:30 [Music]
