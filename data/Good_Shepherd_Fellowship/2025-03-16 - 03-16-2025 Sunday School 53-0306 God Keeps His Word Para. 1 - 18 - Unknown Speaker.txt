[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] happy to be here tonight in the service of the king we used to sing an old song years ago I am happy in the service of the king you remember that song wasn't that just a Dandy happy in the service of the king uh anybody serving in the service of this King that we're talking about got to be happy having it amen now tonight it's a pleasure to be in the little Tabernacle here the people's Tabernacle I like that name that title it's to the people all people everybody's welcome I think them titles like people's Tabernacle Church with the Open Door House of Prayer I kind of like that kind of something about it instead of saying it's the petarian or the Baptist or the Catholic or some church like that well I don't mean them churches not all right understand their titles are all right but I'm just talking about my own feeling I think it's uh he has it's the people Tabernacle the church with the open door or the House of Prayer the Bible said it is written my father's house will be called a house of prayer and um so they take that of course that don't make it any any better any words it's just the names they give it and someone has telling me said what do you think about different denominations do you think if these people has and this people has so forth I tell you it was a a dean of the Lutheran College he' wrote me a letter and you talk about giving me a good R and over he gave me one I was at Minneapolis and he said I drove 15 miles last night in a blinding snowstorm thinking I was going to hear a servant of the Lord and what did I find but a polished up souser and he said and your theology is oh my uh 22 pages in the letter and he really gave me a good one and he said the very idea of a man that stands before the people of Jud do and make statements like you made last night I kept on reading I thought wonder what I say I thought I was go call some of get the tape and check up so he said here's what he's getting at me for he said and I said the Devil Couldn't heal and he said I want you to understand that all your brag of 25 years in Ministry he said son I was preaching the gospel before you was born well I I thought well now all right I okay and he said and let me tell you why that I know that the devil can heal he said I live in a city where there's a woman that has a familiar Spirit you know one of the devil spirits and said people come to her for healing and what did she do but pull some hair out of their head pluck some of no she hair out her head believe and plucks the veins and bleeds it on the hair from her arm from their arm goes down to the river behind her house and pitches it over her shoulder and she walks up and if she is constrained till she has to turn around and look at it then the disease remains on the person and comes back if she doesn't said she tells the people they're going to get well and said we kept count of it and said about 20% of those are healing he said man you mean to tell me if you'd stand up there and have the adoped to say that the devil can't heal Oh I thought well now that's all right see everybody's got a right to their own opinion and I said I just had to answer this little letter little one I got me the one that I was answering was going to be the little one I couldn't think of all that so I sat down and I addressed him he first told me he thought I was a devil a su which would be a devil of course so he said uh you uh I I said dear beloved Brothers I was glad to get your letter I'm always glad for friendly criticism it helps me helps you if you just take it that way Mis let somebody criticize you might have some spots that ought be cleared up I said I'm very happy to get your letter and you must think something of me or you wouldn't wrote to man I said and then another thing that I admire you for is your 50 years of service for my Lord see and I said I I am certainly respect that with high respect I said then another thing I said you must love him or seeing that the crowds that I stood before and my theology I said you must have thought something of the Lord and love him because you wouldn't have tried to correct me see because you love him you don't want his Works going on wrong so I said you must love me and uh I said now the first thing I'm going to say to you I forgive you for calling me a susv I said because and a devil because you remember Jesus when he was doing that very same thing saying that I can do nothing except uh do what the father tells me and was seeing the visions and telling the people what who they were and what they were and what happened and so forth the Pharisees said that was the works of the devil it was a suser a be elub and you know what Jesus said to them he said that you speak that against me the son of man I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost has come you speak against him it'll never be forgiven him I said what if I was right just say what if I was and what have you done there would never be forgiveness in this world the world to come according to the scriptures which cannot lie see now that's the blase of the Holy Ghost is called The Works of God an unan by an unclean spirit and so now I said just to straighten you out better I said I just like to ask you something I'm surprised at a Lutheran Dean would base his theology up on some sort of an experience why I said in the Baptist Church in the and the first year of school we learned the basic everything upon the Bible I all our theology must come off the Bible and here you're trying to base your theology on an experience or I said to settle it Jesus said that the Satan cannot cast out Satan that's settled it then if Jesus said Satan can't heal I don't care what anyone else would say that settles he can't heal that's all and if you look at it he can because the only thing can heal is when it's being made new cells develop come back like you cut your hand the doctor can't heal it certainly not medicine can't heal it takes God to heal it you break your arm doctor can't heal it he just sets it God heals it see because there's only one Creator and if you say that Satan can create oh my where you got yourself and you got him equal with God see and uh he's a God then if he can create he can make himself see but he can't he can create himself if he if he could but he can't create he can just pervert what God has created and um so then uh he can't heal and uh I said but now to answer your give you to my opinion of your answer to your question that you was condemning me on I said that reminds me a whole lot of of things to what going in the world today Pentecostal Fantastics I said certainly I believe that people were healed I believe everyone that comes approaching will be healed I said but it isn't the witch that's doing the healing no more than it is these fellow say I got healing in my hand feel it feel it feel it no you don't you might feel her hand but you don't feel any healing it's a finished work it's already done see so and uh all these different things that they do I said I don't believe those Fells ever heal anybody and I don't believe the witch ever healed anybody but what brings the healing is the individual's Faith thinking they're approaching God through that witch and God's got to honor faith I don't care where it's at see so it's their faith thinking their approach I've seen heathens kneel at idols and get healing see sure Divine Healing from God through the idol but it's their faith they believe that God is in the idol and they got faith and they believe it and God's got to recognize that Faith because them things are based upon Faith healing is not based upon your works or your good deeds or your experience of Christianity and upon your salvation of your soul healing I've seen people come through the line with renowned Saints go right off the platform six yet I've seen illed people walk through and be healed with blinded eyes and everything it's based upon your your faith not upon your religion not upon your experience it's on faith so last time over there he wrote me a letter back and said Mr brandom I hear you're coming back for the Christian businessman's International Convention to speak said could I have a few words with you I refer him to the manager the manager told him all right so when he got there that morning here he was so I went back out to the college beautiful place way out there and when we went in he had dinner set far or you all call it lunch here down south if I call it lunch I I miss a meal breakfast dinner and stuff me I I just so we this was this was dinner time for us and so we went out there and he had a great oh beautiful place hundreds of Acres where the students could work their way through and so forth pay tuition and he had 70 something students sitting there and after we had her dinner he said I want to ask you a question Mr BR I said yes sir I said here it comes Lutheran Dean [Applause] he said I've been down to the Pentecostal since you kick the francher around and everything like that but I won't ask you there anything to it I said yes sir there is I said it's like a little kid when he gets a to he just Falls and I said like Ezekiel said is a valley full of dry bones he said Can these live he said thou knowest so he said prophesy to the dry bones and when the bones come together there's a rattling and a shaking a lot of noise but then when the skin come on want to meat come on him there wasn't much know he said prophesy to the spirit now see I think that's what's going on see so I said they I see him make a lot of noise I said I think the bones are coming together and so he said um we're hungering and thirsting for God I said that's fine said and we want you to tell us how to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said now said we believe that that if we receive the holy go when we believe I did you read Acts 19 and he said yes I said but it's mighty find Baptist up there had a good pastor good preacher his name is apoll his converted lawyer he's proven Jesus the Christ for the Bible I said Paul pass there in Upper close to eus he finds certain disciples and he said them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they said we know have where be any Holy Ghost see so after that was done and there baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and Paul laid his hands up on them and then they receive the Holy Ghost he said but Abraham believed god brother Bram and it was imputed to him for righteous because he believed what more can a man do but believe I said all a man can do I said you believe and accept Christ as personal savior that's your faith but remember God gave Abraham a seal of circumcision as a confirmation of his faith amen that's right and I said then and that was the Old Testament in the New Testament we we say we believe God gives us the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is a seal of confirmation amen see Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption amen it's a seal that God has recognized your faith but if he hasn't give you the Holy Ghost yet he's never recognized your faith see so he said we want the Holy Ghost yeah Lutheran colle I said what's the Lutheran people going to say said we don't care what the Lu people say we want god huise well I said wonderful uh I said when do you want he said right now I said well scoot back your place and I will pray and I had them all go around to the wall like that laid hands on the 72 Lutheran students reive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they got signs and wonders and healings going on in the Lutheran College in Minneapolis Minnesota Lord oh he's wonderful it's not just for you Pentecostal people it's for the Lutheran the Baptist the Presbyterian whosoever will it's for all the only thing we just the thing of it is I think what we need is to get oursel in control and just quit scattering and jumping and respect the gifts of God and things and put them in their places like that and let the Holy Spirit operate the church and then them other people go to hunger and thirsting part but as long as you let it just run loose and this one this way and that one that way and no control they just think it's a bab and they taught better than that in the Bible it's not the gift that they've got against it's the way you Loosely use it that's part what it's against Jesus said you're the salt of the earth but the salt can only be a savior as it contacts so you got to make a contact and your life is the best thing to make a contact with anybody I rather you live me sermon than preach me one anytime the rest of the world will the same thing well now for just a few minutes my wife's in the building and she looks straight at me and she knows that I preach too long and Calla people to stand up and I just somehow know I don't know brother Jackson I just don't know when to quit I'm just a glutton on the spirit I guess so I never did like to try to go to work of a morning when I worked hard and somebody set me out a little dish of corn flakes about like that I can just couldn't Thrive I worked hard and I had to have something some biscuits and sarum molasses and chunk of ham meat and i s i i that's way I I like to eat praise the Lord and if I'm go to work if I'm going to live for God all like to have a good Square 4our meal once in a while you know what I mean just come right out and get the Bible and lay right with it but we Southerners down there are kind of used to that but we know that you Yankees up here are more of a cultured type and um so we uh we know this I tell you I'd sure like to live up here though that's right I sure love this country beautiful in the snow reg dry and and you just hear crunching under the wheels when your car going I just think back when I was a little boy when we used to have snows down Southern Indiana like that but the world must be a little out of its orbit now somewhere she isn't working just right we I believe it's so close to coming of the Lord Jesus everything's talk JY one thing it ought to be straight and running straight is the Church of the Living God am so let us bow our heads a moment just before approach the word now when we lay aside of our little things of a little get together little as it was a handshake or something now we're going to approach God now our heavenly father in the name of thy beloved Son we come asking this petition who said when he was your own Earth if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it now we're so happy for that and he said when thou prayest believe that you receive what you asked for and you shall receive it and I thank thee for this for it's a promise of God and every promise in the book belongs to every believer so I thank thee for it and I pray tonight as I have laid back the these pages of this sacred book called The Bible I'm only able to physically to open it up but only the Holy Spirit can interpret it to us so we pray that he will come tonight and interpret the word and the meaning that would create faith for the Salvation of souls first and for the healing of bodies next and for the bringing of Joy to the Saints and establishing them that they might continue on Grant these blessings father and the Forgiveness of our sins as we ask in Jesus name amen the word is just such a wonderful thing I love it and now to announce what would call for a text for just a little while and U uh and then read some of the scripture here for to get a context I'm going to my text tonight is God keeps his word and I wish to read from St John the 12th chapter and the 35th verse beginning I like to hear you all turning those pages and things I I like to see people bring their Bibles to church and um it means that just if I read his word now my word will fail because I'm a man but if I we get no more out of the service tonight just reading this word together will be blessed because we'll feed that much on the word of God his words will never fail it can't fail God himself at the 35th verse then Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not where he goeth while you have the light Believe In The Light May I stop here just a moment and quote that over again while ye have light believe the light that ye may be the children of light these things spake Jesus and departed and hid himself from them but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him now while I go into the context of this in a few moments uh Jesus had done many miracles as he seen the father show him what to do we got that last night did we nothing but what the father told him to do now 38th verse that the saying of the Prophet at the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which the spoke the Lord who has believed our report and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed therefore they therefore they could not believe because that Isaiah said again notice that they could not believe because Isaiah said but he heard years before this he has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and I should heal them now may the Lord add His blessings to this word did you notice sure how strange that read [Music] [Music]
