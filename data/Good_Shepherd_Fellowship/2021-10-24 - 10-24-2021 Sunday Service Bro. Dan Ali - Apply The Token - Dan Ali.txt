me smile you know i remember loyal was about 15 years old and i remember i looked him in the eye one day and i said loyal i said i know exactly what you're thinking i said you feel sorry for your mom and dad i says would you like to share some of that great knowledge and wisdom that you have at the ripe old age of 15. the only thing he just he didn't say one word he just gave this little mona lisa smile of course years later he told me that's exactly what he was thinking and so of course the lord had you know maybe by the time he was in his early 20s the lord had gotten a hold of his life and he was serving the lord now and and he said he was amazed by how much smarter neil naomi and i had gotten in those six or seven years since he had been thinking about that so so i just appreciate that

for the boat ride yesterday um god bless you musicians yes that will be all for now i probably have to be sitting on the front row from now i was enjoying the basic tie it was so wonderful i could feel it deep down my heart and it was a very wonderful boat ride for those of you who missed it and yesterday i got to see all the young people we have in the church yes and it brings a lot it brought a lot of memories too you know something you love you can never get away from it i love water even though i was drowned once upon a time it has never taken that love away yes i know it's just the first it will not be the last of his kind if we can turn our bibles to exodus exodus 12 exodus 12. yeah when i heard of the prayer request it looked like almost half the church is down but don't worry if there is an empty seat next next to you because wherever the angel i mean this message goes the angel of the covenant is there and i believe that there are angels everywhere there is an empty seat um let's keep praying for them yes exodus 12 12 to 13. for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the first born in the land of egypt both men and beasts and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a talking upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt praise be to god shall we turn over again to joshua 2 12 joshua 2 12. joshua 2 12 also 12 and 13 and i read now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness onto my father's house and give me a true token and that you will save a life my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death praise be to god may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word shall we be seated once again i welcome all of you to the house of the lord if there was any time that we ought to do an introspection to search within our hearts and to make sure that we are living in the pages of the scriptures it is now this is the most dangerous time there has ever been that the bible says that if it was possible the very elect will be deceived because the two spirits are going to get so so close that it is difficult it will be difficult to separate them that it is very very very easy for you to be standing on a very thin ice of in a very cold winter month and then you will think that you are standing on a rock wait spring is coming and we will see whether that sheet of ice is still there or not we are living in the most dangerous time there has ever been and you ought to examine your life every single moment along the way do not care what somebody else is doing do not look across your shoulders if the devil tends your head to the left you see somebody that is not living right look to the left to look to the right you will find somebody that is leaving right the devil would always try to discourage you by appointing you to people that will profess the message and yet are not living right also point them point the devil to people that are professing the message and are living right it is such a dangerous moment our going home time is right here any day it will all be over praise be to god i remember there was a dream i had probably two and a half years ago and in the dream when i looked at the skies the sky suddenly just changed and you could tell that there was danger coming and as i stood i was shouting and calling people's attention that there was danger coming two things happened either they did not care or those who cared actually looked in that direction but they were not seeing what i was seeing but in that moment animals came racing they were just running down the hill they were just racing and running for their dear lives and yet the human beings were not seeing it they were just they were just walking so like a dazy cow i don't know whether that way they sell in the dictionary they just took their time and i was shouting and i was shouting and they wouldn't hear me just about four or five months ago a lot of the times my mind would just go round the dreams i've had over the years 30 40 years and then my mind just came back to this very dream and then noah and the scenario noah went through just played out that in the death of noah as the bible says as it was in the death of noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man that in the death of noah he preached the word 120 years and nobody even heeded it it was just noah his wife his sons and his son's wife and then the animals just came in peace it's half it's just funny to hear how some people just you know a lot of the times talk about noah going to the bush to arrest the animals in peace this was not before the fall where adam could talk to the animals and they were listening after the fall and i imagined noah going to stand before the lion and say come with me by divine intelligence by a divine hand god just escorted the animals in peace male and female the buffalo male and female the elephant male and female not male and male not female and female male and female we don't believe in that tommy road that foolishness out there and you guys in school i know they teach you a lot of stupid things in school know that you are children of god and you don't stand for those things marriage is between a man and a woman don't let anybody tell you that marriage can be between a man and a man or two is just so much filth going on in the olden days did i say in the olden days lord have mercy in those days we read and then we heard how god destroyed sodom and gomorrah for doing these things and then we come to america america and then we are seeing those things we read from the bible the stories we heard we are seeing the reality of it here in america and it's one thing when you hear about it is another thing when you are seeing it it's very horrible i tell you there was a seminar a summit they call it that i attended it was organized by the company i'm working for probably two and a half years ago all over the country were over 600 people and when we got it the person that came to open the whole summit guess what he was a gay and then i was wondering what is going on here what am i doing here as if that was not enough there was a breakout session we brought out probably in hundreds and then we sat in a round table i was on the same table with about three four other people and guess what there was a mass sitting opposite me and when he got the mic he said my husband i said what is this i am looking at a man talking to everybody that saying my husband i said no i'm at the wrong place that they are not even ashamed of the life they are living is such a mess so so so disgraceful that we are living in the days of sodom and gomorrah and there is judgment coming how would you escape that judgment how are you going to escape that judgment we'll get there in a few minutes that god destroyed the whole earth with flood and god gave a sign in the clouds he set his bow in the clouds to keep him in remembrance that so long as this world remains he will no longer destroy it with water praise be to god god gave them thank you a sign a token what a good place to introduce my subject for today the prophet preached i think three or four messages and he titled it the token and we are going to talk about the talking amen praise be to god we are going to talk about the token yes yes now when you take these scriptures we read i want to start from the last one then we go back after the death of moses god gave the mantle of leadership to his servant joshua and he told joshua that as i was with moses so shall i be with you and we all know that joshua was not a man that would pull back his punches no if there was anyone that knew god and knew god very well it was joshua he took god for his word so much so that when they got to kareem kadesh barnia and moses sent them to go inspire the land when they brought an evil report joshua and caleb withstood the rest basing their promise or nothing but the word of god that god has given us the land and we are more than able to take it we are not looking at the size of the men we are looking at what the word of god says praise be to god amen if there was anybody that understood god and took god for his word it was nobody by joshua but look at it and joshua knew that he could take the land without having to send spies to go and spy the land he didn't need any spy and in any case if the spies had even come back with any negative report was that going to stop joshua no way not the judge we have read off but why would joshua send spice in fact as long as this word remains there are certain things that would never change you will think countries spy on one another it probably started maybe in the last decade or two no it's something that has been happening over the years countries spying on one another today we are in an age of technology why the countries use drones for intelligence gathering they use satellites to spy on one another even beyond that they have not stopped the old way why human beings have to go in to spy see america is spying on russia russia is spying on on china and what have you everybody is just fine praise be to god and joshua sends this spice when joshua sent the spice he did not know that there was a woman in jericho by the name of rhea the spies that were going did not know that there was a woman in in jericho by the name of rehab but there was a god there was a god who knew of rahab there was a god who knew that there was rehab there and in god's great eternal plan rahab was there and god knew that jericho was going to go down but rahab was not going to go down with jericho praise be to god and thus make sure that his servant sends his despise now the spies go they go into jericho and then word guess to the king of jericho that the children of israel are here to spy the land oh and i've been wondering how come when they saw the children of israel despised they knew that this was price they knew that this was israelites how because there were other nations around them a christian especially in the day and age we are living in if you have to get to a place to introduce yourself i am a christian i am a christian i am a christian then there is something wrong with your life you a christian a child of god when you walk to a place they should be able to tell who you are you don't need to carry a placard showing who you are by your life the bible says we are written epistles that the word of god has become flesh in you you feed on the word the word has become flesh in you and when you walk out there and the people see you they know who you are you don't have to tell anybody who you are we are living in a world of darkness and when light enters darkness darkness knows that light has come the light does not have to tell the darkness i am here darkness knows it is here praise be to god when you walk anywhere anywhere you go your influence alone tells the people that something about this place has changed they may never know who you are they may never know where you are coming from but there is something just something about you praise be to god and when they got there the children said you the children of israel are here they have come to spy on the land and then white gets to the king and the king says his people go and bring them we have to get these people arrested and then they go to rehab rehab those two gentlemen that came to you they are spies thank you also spies come on come in here they are no that was not rehab praise be to god rehearsal spice oh actually they came here but you know what they just went out that way right after them just hurry before they go and he sent them chasing after these people and then rehab goes in rahab had hidden them in the roof and then rahab goes up and tells them oh so you guys are spies after all you know what that is fine god has already given you guys this land the god of israel indeed is god praise be to god amen oh america is making us to see a lot of things i used to hear about gays and lesbians it was here i saw them and i used to hear about people saying i don't believe there is god i don't believe that is god it's here i actually saw somebody with my eyes telling me he doesn't believe in the existence of god rehab said god has given you the land the god of israel indeed is god oh yes we are worshipping the living god amen there is no god like unto jehovah he is the lord of lords and the king of kings the almighty god there has never been anyone like unto him never before nobody before him nobody beside him and nobody after him he is the one and only sovereign authority there is and the one and only sovereign authority that would ever be the almighty god praise be to god that is the god we are serving we are not serving any i mean any ordinary we are serving the almighty god he said the lord your god he is god and god has given you the land you know what we heard of the wonders the miracles god has done for you guys and we know that god is with you you know egypt in those days was a superpower the way america would sneeze and all other countries would begin coughing that was the way it was with egypt that when pharaoh spoke they listened it was a superpower and rehab said we we heard of how a man by the name moses went before the pharaoh and delivered the children of israel it was not by fighter jets it was not by armored tanks there were no there were no men in boots he just went with his crooked staff and thus says the lord praise be to god and he delivered them we heard of it and how god dried the red sea and you guys went on a dry ground and how pharaoh and his smell got drowned in the midst of the red sea and we heard of how god took care of you people in the wilderness we also heard what you guys did to the kick that to the two kings on the other side of jordan and when we heard that you guys were just across the jordan there is no man left here in this city all our hearts melted there is no man left our house melted within us and god has given you guys this land but you know what i want you to make me a promise i want you to give me a talking that me and my father's house we shall be saved when god gives you this land it's just a matter of time that me and my father's house we shall be saved i want the talking and you are not just going to give me any promise you are going to swear i am going to make you swear by the god you believe amen remember these are people who know that you will not take the name of the lord in vain narrow them to the corner praise be to god they said okay you know what if you do not tell the people our business we are bound to this earth you are going to make us take but if you tell them of our business we are not bound to it in any way but if you keep it a secret our life for yours if we do not keep this oath and rahab was not just asking for herself not for not just for me not just for me but just think about it now when the spice went to the land they didn't go to the chief's palace they didn't go to the politicians they didn't go to the rich man but to a harlot a woman of ill faith a harlot who was making life of herself somebody you readily despised once a child of god you are always a child of god nothing can change your identity nothing there is nothing in this life there is nothing in the life to come that can change your identity and the things you go through in this life can never change who you are who you are is already locked in the things you go through in this life do not determine who you really are no she was living in filth in a very disgraceful profession you can say but yet there was a part of god in here there is no amount of prostitution that can take it away there is no amount of filth that can take it away that seed of life in hell could never be corrupted that god looks down in spite of the filth and the mess in jericho god looks down and said this is my daughter and nothing could change it praise be to god and rahab was not asking just for herself there shouldn't be selfishness in the kingdom of god i believe that what rehab was doing the parents were not proud of her every parent wants to see their child or their children get better than them and then you get you give birth to a child and they go they go to school and they refuse to work and that is what they want to do it's a reproach to the family there is no family that will stand for that and i believe that what rehab was doing the parents were not happy with her they were not satisfied with her and rahab knew that better probably the rehab class said oh yes now there is a lifeline here that i am going to live and would not die with the rest of these people and you know what this is a good time to pay my parents back for all the years of persecution for all the years of trouble they have given me i will make sure they will die with the rest of the people no that was not rehab there comes a time in your life you have to bury the hatchets you come to that point you have to overlook everything and behave like a responsible child of god that not just for me alone but for my father for my mother for my siblings and they said okay that is all good we are going to give you a token this is the rope we are going to go down with and you are going to hang this rope on your window and that is going to be for a talking unto you and all your father's house make sure that they are here if they are not here do not blame us your blood be upon your own head but if you get them here where the token has been applied our life for yours praise be to god she got a talking and here something else comes up that when the spies were living rehab tells them you guys should hurry because the men are on their way looking for you and hurry up and go to the mountains before they meet you on their way back and when you get to the mountains stay there for three days till the men are come back before you go and i keep thinking about it praise be to god that this was a woman that was living in filth complete filth and these were men that were sent by the prophet of god joshua and they knew that god was with them and yet they would listen to this woman this woman that was living in so much filth that was probably a time to tell her who are you to tell us what to do we are serving a living god the lord our god is alive god is here with us god is more than able to take care of us who are you a prostitute to tell us what to do no they didn't do that they heeded to it they listened to her and they did exactly what she said they should do pride goes before a fall and i can't have been thinking about it just think about it rehab's life depended on these two spies because if she had not crushing them and they had fallen in ambush and they were arrested and killed joshua and his men would not know that his spies had given somebody a token out there they were coming to take everybody down their lives depended on rahab rahab's life depending on heart and that is how it is in the house of god our lives depend on one another amen you should be happy when somebody corrects you pride goes before a fall there is no arrogance in the kingdom of god you should be happy now somebody sees something wrong with your life and the couple can come and tell you brother sister oh this this that you should be happy they did it we are one and the same we belong to the same body of christ by one spirit are we baptized into one body if i see something wrong with your life and i can't tell you that means there is something wrong with me and if i tell you and you don't take it check your life sometimes we live so much in the flesh till when we see something wrong or somebody tells us something wrong with our lives we become so defensive so so defensive and all we see is the negative side we never see anything positive all we see is the negative why because we are living so much in the flesh it's time to get out get out for we have a place to go if you live in the flesh to to too much you are going to die and they listened all right i have had to do apply the token it's one thing having the token and it's another thing applying the token if you have the token and you don't apply the talking it's as bad as not having it you can also have the token and apply it wrongly just imagine despite selling rehab applied the token on on the window and the rehab text and said no it has to be it has to be on the door guess what is going to happen it is not what you think it's what god wants amen now remember when rahab applied the token now she had to get her parents under the same roof i don't think rahab went to that father and said daddy you know what two spies came here they are going to destroy this city you guys come with me and they just got up and followed no i don't think that was what happened especially for an ill-fated woman who had gone against the family values whose parents were not happy with her i don't think it was going to be easy i believe the first time he went she went the parents may have sent her packing come on get away from here what are you talking about how do you know and she may have left but here she comes again daddy mommy you know what i received the spice they have given me your token this city is going down i don't know how barano is going down but they have given us a token if we can get everybody under the same roof we are saved they say no you don't know what you're talking about this is a mighty city look at the wolves is there any army in the world that can bring this world down we are sad and secure in this world he said no daddy these walls are coming down i don't know how but i know they are coming down and she goes away maybe she comes again probably rehab's parents may have seen her once every six months but for the first time they are seeing her five six times a day ah what is wrong there must be something about what she is saying and then before the aware she is taking off the paint the paint on her lips oh praise be to god the pain she's taking off the pens all those miniskirts she's throwing them away they show your back and show your front she's throwing them away and she's beginning to dress a long skirt responsible and she's coming around the family not talking about anything but daddy mommy this city is going down we have a promise we have a promise trying to get them together under the same roof and they may have looked at her and looked at her and said you know what there is something about her something has changed something she is no longer the same person we used to know something has changed you know what the best witness you have is your life amen it is not so much about what you tell people they are watching every single step you take your life is a witness unto the people if you profess 110 and you're doing another thing you weakened your testimony they looked at her and said no actually something has changed it's time we begin to listen to her and then they went and then sat in the room the room there's so much hater to go and now they define themselves because that is where the token has been applied and that is the only place that is safe the only place that is safe is where the token has been applied any other place is a dangerous ground they may have sat down rehab when are the people coming rehab open at the window i don't know but i know they are coming and they may have sat down sat down sat down they said you know the chief's palace is probably the most fortified place why don't you go and look for a place there and really said no the only safe grounds is here under the toki praise be to god it's not what you think it's not what you can imagine it's what the word of god says praise be to god and then they were there and we know the story how the children of israel crossed the jordan came spent time in the plains of jordan i jericho um joshua had to circumcise all the children because of all the two million people that came out of egypt only two survived every one of them died only their children crossed over and they had to be circumcised they waited till they got healed and god told them what to do how they marched around the city marched around the wall and probably people the first day they marched around people had their boots on the ground and then it died out they may be inside jubilating oh yes they are outside they can't come in oh we are safe what a mighty fortress we have oh this was a big there is no army that can cross this wall they didn't know what god was doing praise be to god they were trusting in their technology technology of that day god was doing something that the human eye was not seeing that the human mind could not comprehend the second day they went again and i believe rehab will look to the window say praise god they are here every time it will be over i don't know how but i know that it will be over because i believe in their god and we know how the words of jericho came down they went in and killed everybody except rahab the father the mother and the siblings why because they applied the token remember we are talking about what they're talking about they're talking they applied the token a child of god wherever you find yourself remember that your god is with you i will be with you i will never forsake you god has promised to be with us always and never forsake us it is a promise whatever situation you find yourself in whatever condition you find yourself in remember that god is with you the eyes of god are focused on you in every single step you take you may fall here you may rise up there your things may go wrong today tomorrow you don't even know where you are but the fact that you are a child of god the eyes of god are on you there is nothing you can do about it because you belong to god you are a part of him god cannot afford to lose you no way and god has always made a provision for his children god told abraham that your seed after you've been in a strange land for 400 years and after that i will come and deliver them by a mighty right hand and god is a promiscuity in god he kept his promise we know the story i don't want to go so much into it but we know the story how god spoke to moses and moses goes to egypt we know all the drama that unfolded between moses uh and aaron and and and pharaoh and his people and and and pharaoh was so so stubborn as we all know but look when you get to a place and you have to stop one god has a surprise for you yes not just for the for the unbeliever even for a child of god when you are too stubborn god has a surprise for you and you don't want to fall in the hands of god he is a merciful god yes he is merciful remember he is the same no no since god he has not changed the bible says that he is the same yesterday today and forever he changed off note that no nonsense god is the god we are talking about but there is blood on the seats there is blood on that seat that has turned that judgment seat into a mercy seat don't think that god is weak god is not weak and he is not slack concerning his promises it's just for the sake of the blood pharaoh thought he was stubborn but god had a message for him and god told moses and aaron to tell the congregation of israel to get a for each family to get a lamb and the lamb should be without blemish without spots without every family and while the families are small two families can come together and then kill a lamb and that was not the end of story god told them what to do not to cook it to water to roast it with her what have you um how does she ate standing in readiness to move there was no time to waste they were ready to get out and god told them to apply the blood to the lentil post of the door because that same night he was going to go through the land and he was going to break judgment upon the children of egypt and when he sees the blood he will pass over when i see the blood i will pass over you god gave it to them as a sign that was the token god gave to them that when i see the blood i will pass away i will pass over you but anywhere the blood was not applied god was going in there and nothing but judgment awaited them and you could tell yourself oh i am a hebrew i am a hebrew of hebrews you know what i am not going to apply the blood and i am safe and you know that you told a lie you go kill the lamb all right and eat the meat and not apply the blood you are in danger and the word of god told them where to apply the blood you could take the blood and put it spread it on your mattress and then light and cover yourself in the blood was that going to take the judgment away no way it has to be according to god's provided way yes sir it is either according to god's provided way or you have lost it it may not make sense to you it doesn't have to make sense to you that is what god wants and you as a child of god that is what you have to do to be at peace with god you have to do what god wants not what you want not what you think is right it has to be according to god's provided way and that night god went through the land and he struck the first born of every creature starting from pharaoh to his servant and every beast and there was a great cry on the land there was a great cry but wherever the blood was applied wherever the token was applied god did not go in there he passed over the token was applied remember it's one thing having the token and it's another thing applying the token and again is another thing applying the talking rightly and it's another thing applying it wrongly you can apply the token and wrongly apply it and you are in danger all the same they're talking praise be to god and as god mentioned that he took care of rahab that rehab was given a token and god gave the children of israel a talking in this day and age also god has given us a token amen praise be to god rehab received the messengers of her day she believed in the message of her hour she believed it and the bible says by faith rhea believed and she was not destroyed or condemned with the rest of the the people of jericho recognizing your day and your message is very very crucial it's very very important that we have not believed canningly devised tables it's not the intelligence of men believing the message of your day accepting the messengers god has sent to you it's a very very very a lot of time we we we we we under look we underestimate who we are and how far god has brought us why is it that a lot of people hear this message you have heard and to some people it has become a law to some people it has become do's and don'ts but for you it's a joy to live by those things that you don't see it as a burden that you just love it you have fallen in love with it now people look at your life in the marvel don't you think you're punishing yourself too much no it's a joy i just love it i don't see i mean it's a joy praise be to god we are talking about the token the bible says in sin did my mother conceive me and in iniquity was i shaping every human being that was born after the likeness of man and woman was born into sin you didn't have to tell the first lie you were already sin as sinner before you came and the penalty for sin is death that is the penalty for sin is death that was why when sin came into the garden god himself had to kill an innocent lamb an innocent lamb had to die for adam and eve to live and the bible says without a shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin why because the fall had everything to do with the intermingling of blood it had everything to do with blood i remember in those days in the church of um in the roman catholic church uh they would tell us oh it was an apple it was an apple it was an apple and what have you and we believed you so much and for a very very long time the devil was hiding under the apple tree praise be to god god sent his prophet to approach that tree then now we know that it was not an apple it was not an apple praise be to god that it was more than apple i remember when i came to the message the first time i went to church and i heard it preached the serpent's seat oh my goodness i said what is this as i never had this anyway in my life i'm not going to go that way because there is a whole sermon on its own i went to the house i couldn't reconcile it but something says stay away that is not a place you want to go i said no all my life i have been looking for a message if you asked me what i was looking for i couldn't tell you honestly speaking i was a muslim before i became a muslim i was a catholic i became a muslim i went to the church of pentecost i won to church of the apostolic church and and came back i was not just satisfied there was something i was looking for what it was i didn't know until one night i had a word priest it was a crusade and as a matter of fact they had finished preaching and when i got there the preacher was just recapping what he had already preached so i just stood there for that five minutes i stood there i said oh my goodness this is what i've been looking for i said this is what i've been looking for i had a muslim friend he was my colleague when they say we were roommates and i went to the camp i said muhammad i said i have been looking for something all these years as i just found it praise be to god and now i go to the church and they are talking about serpent seed i said what is this and the devil tells me you are the wrong place this is not the place you want to be i said no this is what i have been looking for i said no there must be something here it took me time but i remember one morning around 12 a.m i was sitting down i was just reading reading reading and my goodness the picture came so clear and when god created the heavens and the earth he did not create enough demons to take that away from me praise be to god there are not enough demons in hell that can take that away from me and i'm saying that to the glory of god god has made provisions and sometimes we sit down and we cry we throw our hands we receive i see i mean we throw our hands up in despair and i wonder what god god thinks when he looks down and he sees us in that mode children with authority children with power and yet we sit down and we allow the devil to just come around and misbehave with us stand your ground stand your ground praise be to god you are a child of god brother branham said that when you believe the word of god and you put the same word on your mouth and you speak it it's like daisy speaking it's as good as god himself speaking his word and when when the devil came to the lord jesus to tempt him of all the powers he had he didn't use any of them he just used the word it is written it's written it's written it's for our admonition just speak the word speak the word speak the word oh praise be to god we are talking about the token that every man that was born into this world was born into sin and a penalty for sin is death and for man to live god himself had to provide a sacrifice an innocent lamb had to die for adam and eve to live and in the old testament it was an ordinance god gave to the children of israel there was a safe offering that when the committee sinned there was a time they had to come with a lamb an innocent lamb they would come and confess their sins before the priests put your hands on this innocent animal and they will confess their sins and this animal is slaughtered it will just shake shake shake and bleed and die and they know that the animal is dying in their place that they were supposed to die but the animal has taken the place and that is why they are life and it is the same way physically and spiritually for you to live something must die for you to live something must die the cow has to die you can't catch a big cow and put it in a pot and cook it i want to see that pot for you to live the corn must die and so it is spiritually for them to live an innocent lamb had to die it was not god's perfect will but god permitted it and this was heralding the perfect sacrifice that was yet to come praise be to god the bible says for god so loved the world that he gave us his only begotten son now whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life in the book of revelations when john the elder told john who is worried to take the book and to losing the sister of and john saw that there was nobody and he started crying the angel came back and said john do not cry the elder said john do not cry for for for the lion of the trap of judah has prevailed to take the book and to losing the seals thereof and when he looked what did he see a bloody lump a bloody lamb in the midst of the throne god provided himself a sacrifice there was no man that was worthy and when john the baptist saw him he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world praise be to god he was our sin offering he was our sin offering he was our passover lamb that all our sins my sins and your sins and our iniquities yes because the bible says in the book of isaiah that he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities and this excitement of our peace was laid upon him and by his stripes we are healed and brother says that healing healing and salvation and healing come hand in hand praise be to god that on the cross when he lay there dying my sins and your sins were upon him he never committed any sin he knew no sin he was tempted in everything as branham says but he never sinned in anything he became sin who knew no sin that we should become the very righteousness of god for your sake and for my sake god has to leave his throne above and to take upon himself a flesh and to walk this earth surface and to go through all the things he went through just for you and me and when you turn this down what else is there by the judgment of god if you can turn the grace of god down what else is there by the judgment of god if you turn this grace down there is nothing left for you i'm not scaring you i'm telling you the truth if god had not made a way it is completely different but when he has already made a way he has made a way and you despise it there is nothing left for you but the judgment of god that on the cross he was carrying my sins on the cross he was carrying your sins praise be to god praise be to god that he died in our place and when he started with a loud voice it is finished it was indeed finished praise be to god it was finished the same question was settled the price was paid because the bible says that we are bought and paid with a price with a price the price was paid we are talking about the token and what is the token verbal said a token is a sign that the price has been paid a sign that the price has been paid the proof that the price is paid praise be to god the evidence that the price has been paid now if i go to minas and i go and buy um an oven for ten thousand dollars praise be to god that must be a very big oven [Music] i don't see it entering any home you will have to put it out for the rain to beat it and for the snow to come down on it yes now you don't have to be there to believe that i indeed bought an oven right i can come with a receipt and then show it to you and you can see my name on it and you can see ten thousand dollars that is a price that was paid for it and you can see what item i bought uh an oven and you can see the brand and you have not seen the oven but you have seen the proof that an oven has been paid for i have an evidence oh i remember years ago i would sit right there and i would listen to brother brother brother steve giving his yearly yearly annual report god bless you brother steve and then i will see one dollar fifty cents one dollar seventy three cents three dollars fifty cents and i'm wondering so he takes receipt for all these things what if i was in his shoes i'll be in trouble because i can guarantee you one thing that anything less than fifty dollars you don't get a receipt for it anything hundred and 100 plus yes i'll take a receipt anything between 50 and 100 i'll use my discretion it's either you believe me oh you have to get me a whip yeah god knows how to get his work done he knows you know where to place the people yes so when i come with a receipt and you see there is a proof of payment even though i have not seen it you have not seen it but you can see the proof and now i don't care how useless how useless how useless the oven is i don't care how useless it is if i pay ten thousand dollars for it it shows that the value of it is ten thousand dollars you may not buy it for a cent but to me that is ten thousand dollars i don't have that ten dollars ten thousand dollars in cash anymore but when i look at the oven i see that in my watch ten thousand dollars praise be to god does it surprise you when the bible says that we are made joint health with christ we are made joint health praise be to god because his blood is flowing through us we are the blood of his blood both of his bones the life of his life praise be to god amen we are a royal seed praise be to god joint house with christ that when god looks down he doesn't see you as you oh he sees is the blood of redemption brother abraham says in the message i'm not sure if this is i don't think it's in this very message but he says that all of 150 pound man his weight is 84 cents 84 cents now if there was a market for human meat and then you catch me and you butcher me and you put me on a plate all you get 84 cents you'll be lucky to get something a little more that your soul in one place in other places it says 10 million of this world in other places it says ten thousands of this world that is how much your soul is worth and then you think of a body that is just for 84 cents with something in that body that is white ten thousands of this world my goodness oh praise be to god i pray god we just open our eyes to see and to know who we really are that you are not just anybody but that you are a child of god with promise that you are carrying the safety of god in you you are not like any other person don't look at other people in the street i think they are better than you or you think lord have mercy lord have mercy praise be to god there is something in you something in you that is worth ten thousands or if you want you can even take the ten millions of this world we are living in it is not you it's not you it's the blood that has redeemed your soul the blood of our redemption you can't put a price on it praise be to god don't forget we are talking about the token he shed his blood he shed his blood for us we have been redeemed by his blood and barbara said his blood is the token his blood is the token and it is not the chemistry blood not the chemistry blood by the life in the blood yes when you drain a man's blood out of him the life leaves because there is life in the blood when one kid killed abel yes what did god talk about he said the voice of thy brother's blood cry it unto me you think it was it was a little out there the the liquid no there is life in the blood the talking is the blood of the lord jesus that is how i took him and it is not the chemistry blood but a life in the blood which is god's own life that is the holy spirit so the holy spirit is our token brother brother will tell you to have the blood on your hands is judgment to have the blood of christ on your hands wake that sister up behind you to have the blood of christ on your hands is judgment right but if you can apply the blood to your heart that is redemption it depends on where you apply the blood the holy ghost is our token god in the book of joel promised that i'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh and your sons and daughters would prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and in the book of acts on the day of pentecost and before then the lord jesus told his disciples that tarry in jerusalem do not depart do not depart why because he knows the importance of the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost to a believer to a child of god the holy ghost is our strength the holy ghost is our victory the holy ghost is our healer the holy ghost is our peace the holy ghost is our joy the holy ghost is our life is salvation unto us the holy ghost is everything you would ever desire and when the lord jesus himself will tell his disciples tarry ye in jerusalem do not depart taraji until you are endured with power from on high it tells you the importance of the holy ghost baptism in your life and brethren says it is the earnest of the resurrection if you don't have the holy ghost baptism forget it if you don't have the holy ghost baptism you are in trouble if you don't have the holy ghost baptism you are standing on a sinking scent it's just a matter of time and the picture will play out and on that day of pentecost when the holy ghost came down and they started speaking in tongues what does peter tell the people he said repent every one of you and we baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins he didn't end there and he says and you shall have the gift of the holy ghost for this promise is unto you and unto your children's children and those are far off even as many as the lord our god would call is god who does the calling praise be to god it's not you it's god who does the calling if god uses you you should be you should be humbled enough to know that it is god that it is not your strength no it is not your wisdom it is god working through you is god doing the calling is god doing the pulling praise be to god amen unto as many as the lord our god would call and the bible says if men if your sons would come and tell you daddy mommy i want i want i want egg and you will not give them a scorpion i want bread and you know give them a stone i want fish and you know give them a serpent and the bible says if ye men being evil know how to go to give good gifts unto your children how much would your heavenly father give the holy ghost to them that asking for praise be to god how much and brother branham will tell you that god is more willing to give you the holy ghost than you are willing to receive him amen that when you accept christ and you are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins the holy ghost must come in the holy ghost comes yes and if men being evil know how to give good gifts to their children how much would our heavenly father give the holy ghost to them that are asking for how on earth would god leave his throne above and become a man come and suffer the things he suffered and die and he said no i am going to rush in my spirit no can you imagine such a god no that is not a god we are serving that is not the god we are serving brad braham says god is willing to give you the holy spirit more than you are willing how many times you pray and you pray for the holy ghost how many times how many times we are at the closing time we are the closing time it is not time it's no more time to play church there is no more time playing church don't get off sunday in the morning and because you have no place going so let me just come and spend time you just wasted your time that day let it be that you have purposed in your heart that i am going there to meet god i am going to hear from god i am not going to see a man i am not going to hear from a man i am going to see god a lot of the times we come because we are coming to see a man or to hear from a man and because of that we fail to hear from god before we leave his presence now when god is talking to you all you see is a man there is no more time playing church one of these days it will all be over examine your life on a daily basis examine your life have a relationship with god mean business with god get ahold of god get ahold of god this world is passing by and in any case if it was not even passing by if i am worth ten thousand of this world what do i want to do what portion of it would be i don't you know what portion of 10 000 would be if i owned the whole of minnesota if i own the whole of minnesota what portion of it what fraction of it what fashion would that be of ten thousand you can't even begin to put it together seek god get ahold of god know who you are that you are a son of god that you are a daughter of god that you are here to manifest christ god has you here for a purpose you are just not a number you are not just a number no god didn't bring you here to make you just a number no god has you here for your purpose and you are here to serve the purpose of god if you do not know why you are here seek the face of god god has an assignment for you whatever it is i do not know but you are not here just as a number so we have a token there's one thing having the token and it's another thing applying the token and to apply the token is life not to apply the token is deaf as simple as that to apply the talking is life not to apply the talking is death get the holy ghost get the holy ghost coming to church every sunday and just sitting down it's not enough it's a good place to be but just coming and going is not enough get the holy ghost get the holy ghost i don't know how many times we can emphasize that get the holy ghost do not let a man be a holy ghost do not let a man take the place of god in your life don't let a man be your holy ghost to tell you which church you can go and watch you can't go why you fellowship and why you can't fellowship who you can listen to and who not to listen to oh my brother called me and told me not to have anything to do with that church that is why i don't go to that church on that day when it's time before god tell god that and god will say oh well done my son come into my rest don't let a man be your holy ghost to tell you what church to go to and where not to go to i don't care if this place was once upon a time a gas station i don't care we have it for a holy sanctuary now when we come together god comes down praise be to god i don't care if it was a butcher house i don't care how many cows or how many sheep was spotted here i don't care about that when we come together we have it for a holy sanctuary and god comes down i don't care if there's a manual pile we have it for a holy sanctuary and when we come together god comes down praise be to god that angel of the covenant he didn't leave when brother abraham left the earth's office wherever this message goes that angel of the covenant is here god is here praise be to god why two or three i guarantee my name there i am in the amazed god is a promise keeper god doesn't lie moses can you imagine the number of times moses was walking in the field there in median with with his sheep the number of times he walked on that same ground that same ground where he met god and with the sheep jumping ahead button can you imagine how many times but on that day when god came down what did god tell him now remove your shoes because you are standing on the holy ground as when god comes down the atmosphere changes it's when god comes down there is a different ballgame there's something happened to joshua when he saw that man by the word of jericho which is so drawn and joshua drew his thought who are you are you for us for against us he said i am the the captain of the host of the eyes of the lord and he bowed down and worshiped him and he told him take off your shoes because you are standing on the holy ground praise be to god i don't care what it was before i don't care but when we come together praise be to god when god comes down it is a holy ground it's a holy ground don't take a man's word for it take god's word take god's word take god's word mean business with god until you mean business with god god has no time yet you don't play
