[1:08] the inside was lift up. A beautiful
[1:11] picture of this is pictured in and Ruth.
[1:14] Many of you just read Ruth as maybe a
[1:17] little love story in the Bible, which it
[1:19] is. But oh, what a beautiful story that
[1:24] is representing Christ and his church.
[1:28] how that Noma went over into the land of
[1:30] Moab and there her husband died. Her two
[1:34] sons died leaving widows on the road
[1:37] back. The beautiful picture. Listen,
[1:41] Ruth the Moanite, a gentile,
[1:45] carried away with dumb idols like we
[1:48] were. And when it came time, Naom kissed
[1:51] her and said, "Go back to your people
[1:55] and with your people. I'll go along."
[1:57] But she said, "Let your people be my
[2:00] people. Let me live where you live. Let
[2:04] me die where you die. And let me be
[2:07] buried where you are buried. And let
[2:09] your God be my God." Beautiful picture
[2:12] of the young gentile church coming in by
[2:15] the old Jewish church, the Jews who pack
[2:18] the gospel first.
[2:21] Oh, how marvelous. Let's get the picture
[2:23] right quick while we're running along
[2:25] this line if we can.
[2:28] Now notice, and she would not, but she
[2:31] went on. And did you notice Naom
[2:35] returned in barley season just exactly
[2:39] at the right time when were they
[2:41] gathering barley? And Boaz was her
[2:44] kinsman, and he was harvested in his
[2:47] great field, the Lord of the harvest.
[2:52] And Ruth the young gleaner went out into
[2:54] the field to glean a type of the gentile
[2:57] church gleaning.
[3:01] Amen.
[3:02] Picking up just what they could.
[3:06] The gleaners going ahead.
[3:08] Oh, they say y'all haven't got the
[3:10] Pentecostal business. Oh, yeah. We're
[3:11] gleaning. All right.
[3:14] Look at the Lord of the harvest when he
[3:16] looked down and seen the little woman
[3:18] ready to glean and pick up what she
[3:20] could. a little blessing here and one
[3:22] there which was live tour. Beautiful
[3:26] type of the church today. He said to the
[3:28] reapers, "Every once in a while, drop a
[3:31] handful.
[3:33] I like to find them. Don't you?
[3:36] Just drop a handful."
[3:40] Said, "Because she's found favor with
[3:42] me." Amen. I like that.
[3:46] She might be an offcast, a holy rover,
[3:48] whatever you want to call her, but just
[3:50] drop a few handfuls now and I like her.
[3:54] But who is she? Where did she come from?
[3:57] And when the harvest is over,
[4:02] the great Lord of the harvest, which is
[4:04] Boaz, a representative of Christ to the
[4:07] church. He had fallen in love with her,
[4:10] and he wanted to marry her. But before
[4:13] he could marry her, he had to redeem
[4:15] Naom's lost estate.
[4:20] And before he could redeem her estate,
[4:23] the law, Levitical law was he had to be
[4:25] a kinsman,
[4:27] a near kinsman.
[4:31] When I think of that, the law required
[4:35] him to be a near kinsman,
[4:37] her closest kinsman.
[4:41] And he must be worthy,
[4:43] a man of honor.
[4:46] And he must be able to do it
[4:48] financially.
[4:49] And then he must make an in sign if he
[4:53] had redeemed all she had.
[4:56] Notice a kinsman.
[4:59] God. Man was made in the image of God
[5:02] first. And God is a spirit.
[5:06] And then in order to redeem that man,
[5:09] God had to come down in a form of sinful
[5:12] flesh and become a kinsman.
[5:16] Christ. Amen.
[5:19] Christ was made a kinsman. God was made
[5:22] a kin folks to us. Flesh and blood like
[5:25] we are. Amen. What a beautiful story.
[5:30] The whole Bible just ties together
[5:32] everywhere.
[6:11] as Boaz had to be Nom's kinsman. God to
[6:15] redeem the church must be a kinsman. And
[6:18] he came down taking on himself the form
[6:20] of sinful flesh.
[6:22] Amen.
[6:24] He was worthy. He was God's son. He had
[6:28] to be worth it. He had all heavens and
[6:30] all the earth.
[6:32] Notice Boaz and gathered Israel. And
[6:36] then remember the end sign had to be
[6:38] lifted up outside the gates of the city.
[6:46] I want you to get it. And Boaz came out
[6:49] there and brought the Israel Israel
[6:51] elders and said, "Now, if anyone
[6:56] has got anything to say, let him say it.
[6:59] And see this day that I have redeemed
[7:03] Naom lost the state."
[7:07] And he kicked off his shoe and threw it
[7:09] amongst the Israelites, which was the
[7:11] custom, an in sign that he had redeemed
[7:14] Naom and all she had.
[7:18] What a beautiful sight of God made flesh
[7:22] and dwelt among us.
[7:24] Come down to suffer the death and the
[7:27] penalty,
[7:29] the innocent for the guilty, the lovely
[7:33] one for the unloly.
[7:35] How it breaks the man's heart to think
[7:37] of such that God had to do for lost
[7:40] sinners like you and I.
[7:44] An in sign must be lifted up.
[7:49] You said, "Brother Bram, you mean now to
[7:51] place that snake Jesus?" Yes. It
[7:54] represented Jesus, that bread serpent
[7:56] the inside.
[7:58] For Christ, knowing no sin, yet was made
[8:01] sin for us.
[8:04] And look at him now. When he was beaten,
[8:07] God's just judgment had to be paid. The
[8:10] day you eat thereof, that day you die.
[8:13] God's word has to be kept. There he is
[8:17] standing in Pilot's judgment hall with
[8:18] mockery spit hanging over his face.
[8:22] The hands that raised the widow's son
[8:27] spoke peace to the harlot.
[8:30] The eyes that looked so tenderly upon
[8:32] the crowds was now bleeding,
[8:36] blood running down his face and mockery
[8:38] spit from church members and soldiers.
[8:44] There he goes. Look at him. I see little
[8:48] red dots in his robe.
[8:51] Them little red dots begins to get
[8:53] bigger as he goes up the hill. After a
[8:55] while, they all go together.
[8:58] Then you hear slapping on his side. It's
[9:00] his bloody robe.
[9:03] Then at Gol Gotha, they nailed his hands
[9:05] up and lift him up as an inign. He
[9:08] redeemed the church.
[9:11] Redeemed her what?
[9:13] He said, "Just as Moses lifted up the
[9:16] brass serpent, so must the Son of Man be
[9:18] lifted up." Why? A compound reason.
[9:22] because she had sinned and was sick. And
[9:25] he lifted it up for their salvation and
[9:27] healing. And he was wounded for our
[9:29] transgressions. With his stripes, we
[9:31] were healed.
[9:33] The end sign lifted up.
[9:37] Beautiful.
[9:40] There's the son of God
[9:43] lifted up for your end sign.
[9:46] As Moses lifted up the brass serpent in
[9:48] the wilderness, so must at just the same
[9:51] weight, same cost, same thing. Then what
[9:54] did he do when he lifted up there? When
[9:57] God lifted up the inside to the world,
[10:00] he showed to this church tonight. He
[10:03] showed to the world that he had redeemed
[10:08] all the lost the state of the church and
[10:11] the peoples.
[10:13] And what is our loss? If you've lost
[10:16] your salvation, he's the end for the
[10:20] sins of the world. What a pity.
[10:24] Then do you mean to tell me that you
[10:26] could deny divine healing?
[10:30] There it is in the scripture.
[10:33] That's what Jesus said. Just as Moses
[10:35] lifted the brass serpent, so must the
[10:38] son of man be lifted up for sin and
[10:41] sickness.
[10:44] and he's here tonight.
[10:48] He's still lifted up
[10:51] and he was put into the grave and God
[10:54] lifted him up
[10:56] and his spirit is among us tonight doing
[10:59] signs and wonders. Do you believe it?
[11:04] Now he's ready to make anybody
[11:09] save anybody that wants to be saved.
[11:12] How could you get a mental picture of
[11:15] Calvary
[11:17] and remain a sinner?
[11:20] How could you look at him going up
[11:21] Goltha to the hill to be crucified in
[11:25] your place,
[11:27] a guilty sinner,
[11:30] and see the precious son of God going up
[11:32] the hill, dying in yourstead?
[11:36] How could you look at his back bleeding
[11:40] when he was striped across his back for
[11:42] our healing then deny divine healing?
[11:45] God have mercy.
[11:47] Let me, oh Lord, live. Let me testify to
[11:50] it. If the whole world turns it down,
[11:53] yet Lord, I believe you.
[11:57] I still believe it. If I tonight, if I
[12:03] would preach and a thousand people get
[12:05] converted, be filled with the Holy
[12:07] Spirit, and die in 50 years from now,
[12:09] return back and say, "Brother Brandon,
[12:11] don't go that way because it's not
[12:13] right." I'd still say, "Let me die in
[12:15] Christ Jesus."
[12:18] If I prayed for a thousand people and
[12:20] all of them died in the morning,
[12:21] tomorrow night, I could preach divine
[12:22] healing and pray for the sick just as
[12:24] easy as I can tonight because it's God's
[12:26] word and it can't fail.
[12:29] God's word. God has given it to us.
[12:33] Don't bypass it.
[12:35] Embrace it.
[12:37] Claim the promise. Say, "It's mine. Oh
[12:40] Lord,
[12:41] you died for me, and I'm willing tonight
[12:44] to lift myself up as an example and a
[12:47] testimony. I want to be an insign to
[12:49] you. I want the world to know that
[12:51] you're my savior. I want everybody to
[12:54] know that I lift myself up as a
[12:57] Christian. and I believe you and I'll go
[12:59] testify and tell everyone that you save
[13:02] me and if you're sick I'd get to my feet
[13:05] and say I accept my healing and I as
[13:09] Jesus Christ was lifted up for an inside
[13:11] stripe for my healing so I'll lift my
[13:13] testimony up myself and say by his
[13:15] stripes I am healed.
[13:18] Amen.
[13:19] Oh, what love. Now look,
[13:24] the Israelites looked at the brass
[13:26] serpent and were healed.
[13:29] Looked at the brass servant first
[13:30] forgiven of sin and then healed.
[13:35] As the prophet said or the poet said,
[13:37] "Look and live, my brother, live. Look
[13:40] to Jesus now and live." It's recorded in
[13:44] his word. Hallelujah. It's only as you
[13:47] look you live.
[13:50] Let's look tonight.
[13:52] to God's in sign, the son of God, it's
[13:55] been preached down through the years,
[13:57] the power of the Holy Spirit, that his
[13:59] spirit coming in here and showing signs
[14:01] and wonders and miracles that he is
[14:03] still the same Lord Jesus. How can you
[14:06] escape the wrath of God
[14:08] if you would doubt such things as God
[14:10] would do? Shall we bow our heads just a
[14:13] moment?
[14:20] the great master of life.
[14:24] You say, "Brother Brham, I I never
[14:26] exactly ever looked at it that way. I I
[14:30] never thought about what a price was
[14:31] paid for my salvation here. I've been
[14:34] neglecting it all time." Just before you
[14:37] have the healing service, brother Ram, I
[14:39] want to lift a little in sign to Christ
[14:42] and let him know that
[14:45] that this sinner
[14:47] down here on earth that he died for, I
[14:50] want to know I recognize him tonight. I
[14:52] I want him to have mercy on me. And I'm
[14:54] not yet saved, but I want him to save
[14:56] me. I'm just going to lift up my hand as
[14:58] a little insign to him that he lifted up
[15:00] so much for me. Would you put up your
[15:02] hand right now while everybody's got
[15:03] their heads bowed? God bless you, lady.
[15:05] God bless you, sir. You back there, way
[15:08] back in the back, up the middle rows,
[15:09] way back. I see you with your hands up
[15:11] all around over to my left. Put your
[15:13] hand up. Say, "Brother Brandon, I'm
[15:15] raising my hand to Christ will see me. I
[15:17] don't want to die a sinner. I want to be
[15:20] remembered in a word of prayer right
[15:21] now. God bless you, sir. God bless you.
[15:24] God bless you. Oh my dozens of hands
[15:26] everywhere. I don't want to die a
[15:28] sinner. Brother Brandon, I believe that
[15:30] I've sat in this meeting here. I've seen
[15:32] his person has his work marvelous
[15:35] slipping along through the people here
[15:37] revealing the thoughts of their mind and
[15:39] telling what they were done and I hear
[15:41] the gospel preached by the ministers
[15:43] that I I've rejected a long time but
[15:46] tonight I want Christ to know and I
[15:49] really in my heart something's speaking
[15:53] that's God center friend no man can come
[15:57] to me except my father draws him would
[16:00] you once more everywhere. Everybody keep
[16:02] your head bowed. Let me sit alone. Lift
[16:04] up your hands. Say, "Brother Brand, pray
[16:06] for me that I'll never have to enter the
[16:08] course of God a sinner. I want to be
[16:09] saved." Way up. Way up high. Now,
[16:11] everybody over the building. That's God
[16:13] bless you. God bless you everywhere.
[16:16] That's right. Now, while you have your
[16:18] heads bowed, I want to ask God to help
[16:20] you. Father, dozens of hands up
[16:23] everywhere up and down these aisles.
[16:26] sinner man and women, boys and girls.
[16:31] They want to live, Lord. Many of them, I
[16:34] notice, are old, some of them gray,
[16:37] knowing one of these days we must step
[16:39] beyond this veil. We're walking on the
[16:42] brittle threads of life. Lord Jesus, I
[16:45] pray that the close of this service that
[16:48] these people will be so convinced
[16:52] of the gospel of Christ by the Bible and
[16:54] by the power of his resurrection,
[16:56] they'll come forward and give their
[16:58] hearts to thee and accept thee as their
[17:01] savior. God, don't let any of them slip
[17:04] out of life without being saved. May
[17:06] this be the night and the time that when
[17:08] they'll do this. I know you're dealing
[17:12] with them. For your only beloved son
[17:14] said, "No man can come except the father
[17:17] draws him. And he that comes to me, I
[17:19] will know why wise cast out. And he that
[17:23] heareth my words, believeth on him that
[17:25] sent me, has everlasting life, and shall
[17:27] not come into judgment, but passed from
[17:30] death to life.
[17:32] Just because we believed on the Son of
[17:34] God.
[17:36] What a pity, Lord, to see a great world
[17:39] going to wreck or that one thing,
[17:42] rejecting the Lord Jesus. Grant that
[17:45] many tonight will be saved. And now may
[17:48] the Holy Spirit come and send the angel
[17:50] of the Lord to your humble servant as I
[17:53] pray for the sick. May each one look
[17:55] down to Calvary and say that's my
[17:56] inside.
[17:58] I believe with all my heart and I'm
[18:01] going to believe my healing tonight. I'm
[18:03] going out of here rejoicing and happy
[18:05] and claim my healing.
[18:07] Grant it Lord for we ask that in Jesus
[18:10] Christ's name. Amen.
[18:14] When I come to platform night, the
[18:15] pastor asked me, one of the pastors
[18:17] here, if I would stay over till next
[18:19] Sunday.
[18:21] I told him I would ask our Lord and if
[18:23] the people and everything seems to be
[18:25] all right, maybe he'll direct me that
[18:27] way.
[18:30] We've had a hard start. A brother's
[18:33] shoulders and said,
[18:35] "If I would have took my message to the
[18:37] red hot Pentecostals,
[18:40] I wouldn't have been tore up like I am
[18:41] today and dying."
[18:43] Tried to sell it to a bunch of people
[18:45] who didn't know nothing about God and
[18:47] wasn't born again. So, they're just
[18:49] nothing. Just worried the man. It caused
[18:51] the fungus growth to turn to cancer and
[18:53] killed him.
[18:56] Be sure you're right with God, friend.
[19:00] Notice he said they had the little Moody
[19:04] Bible
[19:06] school up there sent out the little
[19:08] quartet and they were singing for him.
[19:10] Near my God to thee. And Paul, if you
[19:12] knew him, he was quite a fellow to cut
[19:14] up. A whole lot like brother Baxter.
[19:17] He said, who's dying, you or I? He said,
[19:20] "Raise them curtains and sing me some
[19:22] good, snappy gospel songs." So they
[19:25] begin to sing down at the cross. He
[19:26] said, "Where's Luke?" That was his
[19:28] brother. He and Luke worked together
[19:30] like my son and I.
[19:33] Luke come in. He was in the next room
[19:35] crying. He took a hold of Paul's hands.
[19:37] He said, "Luke, we've come a long ways
[19:40] together, buddy." He said, "But think of
[19:42] it. In five minutes from now, I'll be
[19:45] standing in the presence of Jesus Christ
[19:47] clothed in his righteousness.
[19:50] Lives of great men all remind us we can
[19:53] make our lives sublime with partings
[19:54] leave behind us. Footprints on the sands
[19:57] of time.
[20:01] All you have to do is believe.
[20:04] And Paul Rder wrote this song in Fort
[20:06] Wayne recently. Is any of you at the
[20:07] Fort Wayne meeting when I was there?
[20:10] I sitting in his study room there where
[20:12] Reigger, Mr. Rediger, the gallant hero
[20:15] of faith years ago when I was a little
[20:17] bitty boy. His daughter been the insane
[20:20] institution two years perfectly insane.
[20:23] They had her my coal shed down there
[20:25] behind the church sitting there pulling
[20:27] her beautiful hair down saying a nickel
[20:29] and a penny and a nickel and a penny
[20:31] like that. Insane. Her sister died in
[20:34] the same condition. When I heard that
[20:37] Reigger's daughter was laying in my cold
[20:39] shed back there, I went back and there
[20:41] was a lovely Miss Ready, sweet, lovely
[20:45] woman sitting there saying, "Honey,
[20:47] don't do that."
[20:49] I come in the door. I noticed the vision
[20:51] break before her. I could think of her
[20:54] old daddy who died in the harness and
[20:57] the evil spirit had caught the girl.
[21:00] The Lord gave her a rebuke said, "Come
[21:03] out of the girl."
[21:05] She looked up and said, "Mother, where
[21:07] are we at?"
[21:09] She's married and got children now.
[21:12] From that very hour, God made her whole.
[21:17] That's Mrs. Be ready, the owner of the
[21:20] Fort Wayne Gospel Tabernacle. Many of
[21:22] you know that, right? And as the what
[21:25] was it? Look and live.
[21:28] The grace of Christ. You got them all
[21:30] there, Paul. Reverend. Now, now I want
[21:33] you to do this for me. How many has been
[21:35] in the meetings before? Let's see your
[21:36] hands. Jesus is here on earth.
[21:39] The things that Jesus would do
[21:42] when he was here on earth, he said,
[21:44] "It's not me that doeth the works. It's
[21:47] my father that dwelleth in me. He doeth
[21:50] the works." Is that right? And then in
[21:54] St. John 19 or St. John five when he
[21:58] passed by the gate Bethesda the pool
[22:02] there were great multitudes of lame halt
[22:04] blind withered people is that right
[22:06] Christians
[22:09] and he never healed one of them yet full
[22:12] of love and compassion went over to a
[22:14] man laying on a pallet and healed him
[22:17] the Jews questioned him well listen what
[22:20] Jesus said now St. John 5:19
[22:24] scripture
[22:26] verely barely I say unto you the son can
[22:30] do nothing in himself
[22:32] but what he sees the father doing that
[22:36] doeth the son likewise for the father
[22:38] workketh I workketh hitherto in other
[22:42] words he said this I can't do nothing
[22:44] till god shows me what to do then I do
[22:46] that nothing else I can do
[22:49] is that scripture
[22:52] All right. Then Jesus Christ never
[22:55] performed one miracle
[22:58] until God told him to do it. So he had a
[23:01] vision God telling him. He said the
[23:05] father showeth the son. Whatsoever
[23:08] things the son sees the father doing
[23:10] sees the father doing.
[23:13] Present tense and he goes does it just
[23:15] like the father said. Now he said a
[23:18] little while and the world will see me
[23:20] no more. The world's the unbeliever. The
[23:23] world's seen anymore. Yet you'll see me
[23:27] for I'll be with you even to the end of
[23:31] the world. That's Connorsville, Indiana.
[23:34] Everywhere else.
[23:36] Now if he rose from the dead, his
[23:40] spirit, God himself and the Holy Spirit,
[23:43] Jesus Christ moving among the people and
[23:47] he set some in the church, preachers,
[23:50] teachers, prophets
[23:52] and so forth. Is that right? For what
[23:55] purpose? For the man to glorify himself?
[23:58] For the edification of the church?
[24:02] To bring the church to living faith?
[24:06] and Christ,
[24:08] he raised
[24:10] them up for that purpose. Now, if Jesus
[24:14] words are true and Paul in Hebrews 13:8
[24:19] said Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[24:20] day and forever, then if he said the
[24:23] world wouldn't seem, but the believer
[24:25] would, and he'd be with them, he said,
[24:27] "Now the things that I do, you shall do
[24:30] also."
[24:32] Now, he knew their thoughts. Is that
[24:34] right? He he he knew what they were
[24:37] thinking about. He perceived their
[24:39] thoughts. When the father showed him a
[24:41] vision where a fish had a coin in its
[24:43] mouth, where there was now there's some
[24:45] blind boys followed him one day out in
[24:47] the street. They said, "Have mercy on
[24:49] us, Lord. Have mercy." He just ignored
[24:51] him and walked on. He went into the
[24:54] house and they brought the blind boys to
[24:56] him. And he turned around and touched
[24:59] them. said, "According to your faith,
[25:03] no vision. According to your faith, be
[25:07] it unto you.
[25:09] As thou has believed, so shall it be."
[25:13] Is that right? The woman touched the hem
[25:15] of his garment and said, "Thy faith
[25:19] has healed thee." See, now you look at
[25:22] him under Calvary night, the inside, and
[25:25] your faith in his finished works is what
[25:28] heals you. Now, his spirit is here,
[25:32] who you couldn't hide your life from
[25:34] him.
[25:36] But he can't heal you. For he's already
[25:39] did that when he lifted up the inside.
[25:42] He redeemed you from your sickness. He
[25:46] redeemed you from your sin.
[25:50] That seems to be coming back to me
[25:51] tonight somehow. Somebody you're
[25:53] doubting that. I'll find you in a few
[25:54] minutes.
[25:59] All right.
