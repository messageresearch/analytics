[0:10] so circumcision the Holy Spirit today
[0:16] circumcised is the heart and it's a sign
[0:19] a given side someone said the other day
[0:26] I just repeat this not as a joke because
[0:30] it's the truth but it sounds like a joke
[0:33] and as I've often said this is no place
[0:36] for jokes but there was a little German
[0:40] out on the west coast where we were just
[0:44] that he received the Holy Ghost and he
[0:49] went down the street and he would walk a
[0:52] little piece and he'd raise up his hands
[0:54] and speak in tongues and he would run
[0:56] and he would jump and he would shout and
[0:59] he was at work carrying all I got and
[1:01] his boss said to him where have you been
[1:07] I like those places where you have been
[1:14] he said you must have been down amongst
[1:16] that bunch of nuts he said then you
[1:23] think they are nuts he said surely are
[1:28] he said well praise the Lord for the
[1:31] nuts
[1:33] and he said do you know what the nuts
[1:38] play a big part he said for instance the
[1:42] automobile you take all the nuts out of
[1:46] it you ain't got nothing but a bunch of
[1:48] young so that's just about right you are
[1:55] so different when the Holy Spirit comes
[2:00] on you until the mind of this world
[2:04] don't like you in there against you and
[2:07] they don't want nothing to do with you
[2:09] at all
[2:10] you're a born of another world you are
[2:15] just as much an alien at ten times more
[2:19] alien you'd be if you'd go too far from
[2:21] regions of African jungles you're
[2:25] different when the Holy Spirit comes and
[2:28] it's a sign it's a mark amongst the
[2:32] people now you say then brother Brennan
[2:37] that sign of circumcision was given to
[2:40] Abraham that is true and to his seed yes
[2:46] all right now we are going to turn to
[2:50] Galatians third chapter xxix first and
[2:53] see how that could apply to us Galatians
[2:57] three and 29 and just see how this
[3:03] circumcision could have applied to a
[3:06] Gentile if we are Gentiles which by
[3:13] natural birth we are now the first I
[3:18] want to read the sixteenth verse now to
[3:21] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[3:24] made Abraham and his seed he said not
[3:30] and to seeds just any kind of a cell I'm
[3:34] Abraham seeds - no - a seed Abraham's
[3:39] seed not the seeds as of many but as of
[3:43] one and two
[3:45] do they and to thy seed which is Christ
[3:51] Christ was Abraham's seed you believe
[3:54] that all right now let's get the 28th
[3:59] and 29th first there is neither Jew nor
[4:03] Greek neither is our bond are free
[4:07] neither is our male or female for we are
[4:11] all one in Christ Jesus and if I be
[4:18] Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and
[4:21] her heirs according to the promise
[4:27] how do we take on Abraham's seed by
[4:32] being in Christ then we are Abraham's
[4:36] seed and what was the seed of Abraham as
[4:41] we might go on to Roman's forward
[4:43] different places Abraham never received
[4:49] the promise while he was circumcised to
[4:54] show that circumcision was just a type
[4:57] he received the promise before he was
[5:01] circumcised and it was a type of
[5:06] recognition of his faith that he had
[5:10] before he was circumcised now when we
[5:14] are in Christ we become Abraham's seed
[5:19] and her heirs with Christ therefore no
[5:24] matter who we are Jew or Gentile and the
[5:28] seed of Abraham the seed of Abraham has
[5:33] the faith of Abraham who takes God at
[5:38] His Word regardless of how ridiculous it
[5:42] seems how unusual you act how peculiar
[5:47] it makes you you take God at His Word
[5:51] regardless of anything
[5:54] Abraham at 75 years old and Sarah at 65
[5:59] took God Addie's wording called anything
[6:03] contrary to it as though it wasn't what
[6:07] do you think the doctors thought of that
[6:08] day what do you think the people thought
[6:11] when they seen an old man 75 years old
[6:14] going around praising God he's going to
[6:16] have a baby by his wife and her 65 years
[6:19] old about 25 years past menopause but
[6:24] you see it makes you act funny the faith
[6:28] of Abraham and when you're circumcised
[6:31] that the Holy Ghost it does the same
[6:33] thing to you it makes you do things that
[6:36] you didn't think you would do it makes
[6:38] you take God's promise and believe God
[6:41] now it's also besides I see a promise
[6:48] and a sign it's also a seal now if you
[6:56] will go with me unto Romans a first I
[7:01] want you to go with me to Ephesians 4:30
[7:05] and let's read here just a minute
[7:12] Ephesians 4:30 says this now you've
[7:16] heard so many people say that different
[7:19] things are seals if you go into the
[7:22] church you have the seal of the church I
[7:25] mean some people says it's keeping a
[7:28] certain day a Sabbath day that's that's
[7:31] a seal of God some of them says if we
[7:34] put our membership into a certain
[7:36] denomination we are sealed into the
[7:38] kingdom of God
[7:39] now the Bible said let every man's word
[7:43] be a lie in God's be the truth
[7:47] now Ephesians 4:30 reads like this and
[7:51] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[7:54] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[7:59] redemption
[8:03] I'm going to have to get a little bit
[8:04] hard on this now lay down are you
[8:07] legalist brethren just hold quite for a
[8:09] little bit did you notice how long that
[8:12] C arised not to the next revival until
[8:19] the next time something goes wrong I'm
[8:22] kill the day of your Redemption you're
[8:28] sealed until the day of your redemption
[8:33] when you are redeemed up to be with God
[8:36] that's how long the Holy Spirit sees you
[8:40] not from revival to revival but from the
[8:43] eternity to eternity and you're sealed
[8:46] by the Holy Spirit that's what the Holy
[8:49] Spirit is it's a seal of God that he's
[8:53] found you found grace in his sight and
[8:56] he loves you and he believes you and
[8:59] he's pretty seal upon you what is the
[9:02] seal anyone or seal designates our means
[9:07] of finished work God has saved his
[9:15] sanctified you cleans you up found favor
[9:18] with UNCG's finished you're his product
[9:23] until the day of your redemption the
[9:28] sealed is the finished thing what is the
[9:30] Holy Ghost it's a sign we're going to
[9:35] get on that little later on another
[9:36] message the sign of Paul spoke of
[9:39] tongues was assigned to believers all
[9:41] right I'm not notice but in this the
[9:46] Holy Ghost is a sign I mean and the Holy
[9:50] Ghost is a seal it's a sign that God
[9:55] gave to his chosen children to reject it
[10:00] is to be cut from the people I'm to
[10:04] receive it is to be finished with the
[10:07] world
[10:11] and to be a product that God has put a
[10:17] seal of approval on I used to work on
[10:21] the railroad I here with Harry Waterbury
[10:23] and we would go down to load a car
[10:28] my brother done standing back there
[10:31] helped loads cars when a cars being
[10:36] loaded they go through that car the
[10:39] inspectors and if he finds anything
[10:42] loose water fall and break or anything
[10:45] that would destroy he'll not seal that
[10:48] car until that car is so completely
[10:54] packed until it's so packed down and so
[11:00] in order that the shaking of the ride
[11:03] won't bother the product that's on the
[11:06] inside that's what's the matter we don't
[11:11] get seal so much we're too loose about
[11:15] things when the inspector goes through
[11:22] to inspect your life to see if you're
[11:26] not just a little loose about things a
[11:28] little loose about your prayer life a
[11:30] little loose about that temper little
[11:33] loose about that time to talk about
[11:35] others he'll never seal the car some
[11:41] dirty habits some bow things some
[11:46] vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but
[11:52] when he's found everything his place the
[11:56] inspector then he seals it
[12:02] there be anybody open that seal and tell
[12:08] that car's reached its destination award
[12:11] seal for there it is
[12:15] cuts not my anointed do my prophets no
[12:19] harm or I say unto you would be better
[12:22] for you that a millstone was hanged at
[12:25] your neck and you were drowned in the
[12:27] depths of the season even to try to pin
[12:30] or shake a little on the least of these
[12:35] that's been sealed you see what it means
[12:41] that's what the Holy Spirit is it's your
[12:44] assurance it's your protection
[12:47] it's your witness it's your seal it's
[12:52] your sign that I'm headed down okay what
[12:56] the devil said I'm heaven bound Wow he
[13:02] sealed me he gave it to me he sealed me
[13:07] into his kingdom and glory bound that
[13:12] the winds blow let Satan do what he
[13:14] wants to gods done seal me till the day
[13:17] of my Redemption hey man that's what the
[13:23] Holy Ghost is oh you should want it
[13:26] today I couldn't go on without it so
[13:31] much could be said there but I'm sure
[13:34] you know what I'm speaking of now also
[13:39] let us turn to John 14 just for a minute
[13:46] I just love the word it's the truth now
[13:54] the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost what is
[14:00] the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of
[14:05] Christ in you now before we read I'd
[14:12] like to say a few commenting words what
[14:15] is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is
[14:19] the Holy Ghost it's a covenant what is
[14:21] the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the
[14:25] Holy Ghost and it's a the spirit of
[14:29] Jesus Christ in you a little while said
[14:37] Jesus that the world sees me no more yet
[14:41] you shall see me there I will be with
[14:45] you even in you to the end of the world
[14:51] Spirit of God in His Church what far why
[14:56] did he do it far this is a little own
[14:58] tomorrow night subject but what did he
[15:00] do it Paul why did he why did the Holy
[15:04] Spirit well what did he come for what
[15:07] did he come in you fall what did he come
[15:10] in me for wants to continue the works of
[15:14] God I always do that which is pleasing
[15:18] to my father I come not to do my own
[15:21] will but the father that sent me and the
[15:24] father that sent me is with me as my
[15:28] father has sent me so send you Oh
[15:36] the father said him went anymore the
[15:40] father that sent Jesus came in he walked
[15:43] to him the Jesus that sends you goes
[15:46] with you and is in you and if that
[15:52] spirit living in Jesus Christ made him
[15:55] do an act the way he did you'll have
[15:58] some general idea how to do when it's in
[16:01] you because that life cannot change
[16:03] it'll go from body to body but it cannot
[16:07] change its nature Orion is gone now in
[16:11] John 14 is let's read just a little bit
[16:14] beginning of the tenth verse believe us
[16:17] doubt that I am in the father and the
[16:20] father in me the works the words that I
[16:24] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[16:28] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[16:30] the works think of it now believe me
[16:35] that I am in the father and the father
[16:37] in me
[16:38] or else believe me for the very works
[16:42] sake verily verily I say unto you he
[16:45] that believeth on me the works that I do
[16:47] shall he also and greater works than
[16:50] these shall he do because I go to my
[16:52] father
[16:53] don't you see see I said there and i
[16:56] watch this how this comes out I read
[16:57] this little farther we're gonna read
[16:59] down about the 21st and whatsoever ye
[17:05] shall ask them I see I had the young and
[17:10] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that
[17:12] will I do that the father may be
[17:14] glorified in the son
[17:16] if you shall ask anything in my name
[17:19] I'll do it if you love me keep my
[17:20] Commandments and I will pray the father
[17:23] i watch and he shall give you another
[17:28] comforter that he may abide with you
[17:34] forever even the Spirit of Truth whom
[17:39] the world cannot receive because it
[17:42] seeth him not neither North him but you
[17:52] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[17:59] you who is that spirit then what is the
[18:04] holy gold its Christ in you the
[18:11] comforter that's the Holy Spirit and
[18:15] when the comforter has come he will do
[18:19] the same things that I done while the
[18:24] comforter is in me
[18:25] I'll pray the father he'll give you this
[18:28] comforter you know that come for the
[18:30] world don't know him never will but you
[18:34] know him because he dwells now with you
[18:37] Jesus speaking but he shall be in you
[18:41] there you are that's the comforter shall
[18:47] be in you I will not leave you
[18:50] comfortless I will come to you I will
[18:54] not know that's a comforter Christ
[18:56] that's what the Holy Ghost is it's
[18:58] Christ yep a little while and the world
[19:01] seeth me no more but ye shall see me
[19:05] because I live you live also oh we could
[19:11] go on and on but let you know what is he
[19:14] he's the seal he's the son he's a
[19:19] confident see what all he is the seed of
[19:24] Abraham inherited down let's also find
[19:29] that the what else the comforter is
[19:32] let's go to first John 16:7
[19:36] see if he isn't an advocate - you ought
[19:39] to advocate is making an advocate we
[19:44] have an advocate we know them first John
[19:49] the sixteenth chapter
[19:53] oh wait a minute I'm sorry Saint John it
[20:00] is sixteen seven I'm sorry I'm sure
[20:02] sorry I said that I read that wrong I
[20:04] got sixteen seven nevertheless I tell
[20:09] you the truth it is expedient for you
[20:14] that I go away for if I go not away the
[20:18] comforter will not come unto you but if
[20:22] I depart I will send him unto you and
[20:27] when he has come he will reprove the
[20:31] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[20:35] judgment of sin because they believe not
[20:39] on me of righteous because it go to the
[20:44] Father and you see me no more of
[20:46] judgment because the prince of this
[20:48] world is judged mine now the Advocate
[20:54] found in in first John 2:12 now let's
[20:58] read that just a minute first John 2:12
[21:02] I beg your pardon first John 1 and 2 it
[21:10] is I've got these wrote down first John
[21:12] 2:1 - to my little children these things
[21:18] write on to you that you sin not and if
[21:22] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[21:26] father Jesus Christ the righteous who is
[21:31] advocate Jesus Christ the righteous and
[21:37] he is he is there a propitiation for our
[21:42] sins and not for ours only but also for
[21:46] the sins of the whole world what is the
[21:52] Holy Ghost
[21:53] it's an advocate what does and what is
[21:56] an advocator what does it do make an
[21:58] advocate it has mercy it stands in your
[22:02] place it does things that you can't do
[22:07] it's it's a propitiation or your sins
[22:10] it's your righteousness it's your
[22:13] healing it's your life it's your
[22:17] resurrection it's all that God has for
[22:21] you he's an advocate how we could go
[22:24] into details of that and break that down
[22:26] of how that one
[22:29] it makes intercession for our ignorance
[22:32] sometimes we got the Holy Ghost weak
[22:35] ignorant they stagger into something the
[22:37] Holy Spirit started to make advocate for
[22:40] us he is our educator he stands our he's
[22:43] our attorney he stands there and pleads
[22:46] for us we don't plead for herself
[22:49] because the Holy Ghost in us pleads for
[22:51] us the Holy Spirit given utterance
[22:55] sometimes his words you can't understand
[22:57] and he makes intercession for us that's
[23:01] what the Holy Ghost is when I walk in
[23:04] anything I walk like a little kid you
[23:07] walk like a little seller we're walking
[23:10] in a dark world full of enemies full of
[23:13] sin full of traps full of everything you
[23:17] say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take
[23:19] Christian life I'm afraid to use I'm
[23:21] afraid of this don't be afraid we have
[23:25] an advocate Lena
[23:28] oh he spends bias he's in US and he
[23:36] makes intercession for us the Holy
[23:38] Spirit constantly constantly making an
[23:42] advocate for us all the time
[23:44] he is our educator oh how we thank
[23:48] confident a seal a sign the spirit of
[23:54] life the God of heaven the comforter the
[23:58] life The Advocate
[24:00] what is he oh ma we could go on for
[24:04] hours with it now we're going to change
[24:06] just for a minute now we're going to ask
[24:11] now
[24:15] promised to us in the last days this
[24:19] advocate sealed promised everything that
[24:24] we have talked about him tonight with
[24:25] 10,000 times more
[24:27] he was made a promise to us in the last
[24:30] days they didn't have it in that day
[24:33] they just had a seal in their flesh as a
[24:36] token and a sign believing it was coming
[24:39] and they walked by the shadow of the law
[24:42] which they were circumcised by flesh the
[24:46] day we don't walk by the shadow the law
[24:48] we walk by the power of the Resurrection
[24:50] we walk by the power of the Spirit who
[24:53] is our true seal our true advocate our
[24:56] true comforter our true sign that we
[25:00] have been born from above peculiar odd
[25:03] people acting funny taking God at His
[25:06] Word calling everything else wrong God's
[25:10] words right that's all that's what the
[25:13] Holy Ghost a do you want it when you
[25:17] love to have it let's see if it was
[25:19] promised now let's go back to Isaiah The
[25:23] Book of Isaiah let's get the 28th
[25:25] chapter of Isaiah now we're going to
[25:28] Isaiah 28 and we're going to begin about
[25:31] the let's take the eighth verse see what
[25:34] Isaiah said seven hundred and twelve
[25:37] years before it come we could say a lot
[25:39] about this go back all the way back but
[25:42] we'll just start right here and see if
[25:44] it was promised to the church what day
[25:47] wasn't supposed to come up on the life
[25:50] stage from there be a a corruption now I
[25:53] remember the words in plural days the
[25:56] last two days the last 2,000 years now
[26:01] not the eighth verse all for all tables
[26:06] are full of filthiness so that there is
[26:10] no clean place search around today here
[26:16] to find it
[26:17] look around see free in that day all
[26:21] tables while they go to the Lord's
[26:24] Supper and the first thing in the
[26:27] material line take an old piece of light
[26:29] red or soda cracker and break it up and
[26:33] make the communion when that's supposed
[26:36] to be made with Holy Ghost hands a 911
[26:39] brand Christ is not dirty and filthy and
[26:43] that represents you another thing they
[26:47] give it to people that drink lie steal
[26:52] smoke chew just anything as long as they
[26:58] belong to the church far be it if a man
[27:03] ever takes it when we're reading this
[27:04] sure he's reading and drinking damnation
[27:07] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[27:09] body
[27:09] they don't live the life keep away from
[27:12] it and if you don't take it it shows
[27:15] that your own conscience is guilty he
[27:17] that he does not has no part with me
[27:19] Jesus death but all tables of the Lord
[27:22] has become full of Filth there's no one
[27:25] clean place listen if that don't picture
[27:29] today whom shall he who shall he teach
[27:33] knowledge and whom shall he make
[27:36] understand doctrine who will understand
[27:41] knowledge who can he make to understand
[27:44] doctrine well bless God on Presbyterian

[28:25] drawn from the breasts
[28:28] little babies say well I'd go to church

[28:33] nothing against that dear brother now I
[28:36] realize this is being taped that's all
[28:38] right
[28:39] Bongo Mama's Church but listen mama
[28:43] walked in one light you're walking in
[28:45] another Luther walked in one night
[28:48] Wesley walked in another Wesley walked
[28:51] in one light Pentecost walked in another
[28:53] but we were walking on higher than that
[28:56] today
[28:56] and if there was another generation
[28:58] we'll go beyond us back in the early
[29:03] days when the pain was wide way wide
[29:08] Luther taught justification by faith
[29:11] that was just to bring the people from
[29:13] Catholicism in to Protestantism into the
[29:17] fellowship around the word justification
[29:20] by faith as a big wide fear they never
[29:23] moved from that along came another
[29:25] revival called John Wesley it shook him
[29:28] down from that brought her down to
[29:30] sanctification leave a good clean holy
[29:33] life sanctified by the Word of God give
[29:36] joy in your heart that's Chuck awful out
[29:40] of a Lutheran doctrine then a longtime
[29:42] Pentecost with the baptism of Holy Ghost
[29:44] a narrative that again by receiving the
[29:46] Holy Ghost that's right and now that's
[29:50] begin to shake down and the gifts and
[29:52] the restoration and the Spirit of God
[29:54] has come in in the fullness of signs and
[29:57] wonders into the church and shock
[29:58] Pentecost
[30:00] what is it we were so close to coming
[30:03] out of the Lord Jesus until the very
[30:05] spirit that was in it is working in the
[30:08] church doing the very same things that
[30:10] he did when he was your honor
[30:11] it's never been any word back from the
[30:13] time of the Apostles till this time my
[30:17] see it's wide narrow is narrow Sarah
[30:20] what is it just like your hand coming to
[30:22] a sheddeth the negative negative
[30:24] negative or what is it's a reflection
[30:26] what was Luther a reflection of Christ
[30:29] what was Wesley a reflection of crime
[30:31] look Billy Sunday's aids just ended the
[30:36] other day old dr. Whitley's taught lie
[30:38] you're on this pulpit the last one of
[30:40] the old school died around 90 against
[30:44] Billy Sunday was a revivalist to the
[30:48] nominal churches of his days he pull
[30:50] roll punches stand up there in horror
[30:52] all you method is hip the sawdust trail
[30:54] of preachers and all all of you Baptists
[30:57] hit the sawdust trailer you presbyterian
[30:59] he pulled no punches
[31:01] he was the Billy Graham of this day
[31:03] notice and then the same time it's a
[31:06] nominal churches having a revival what
[31:08] taking place the full gospel is having a
[31:11] revival there come forth the Bosworth
[31:14] brothers Smith Wigglesworth and dr.
[31:17] prize
[31:17] Amy McPherson all those look Smith
[31:21] Wigglesworth died one night dr. price
[31:23] died the next morning within 24 hours I
[31:25] was on the field now my ends coming down
[31:31] look at you don't hear much have been
[31:33] agreeing you don't hear much about Oral
[31:35] Roberts I see my meeting shattering
[31:37] what's the matter
[31:37] we're at the ears another age how did
[31:40] Billy Sunday come in and then they come
[31:42] in just after the great moody revival
[31:45] when did moody come in just after Knox
[31:47] revival when the knocks come in just
[31:51] after finish revival penny after Calvin
[31:54] Calvin after soul
[31:57] Wesley and Wesley actor Luther on down
[32:00] through the ages come as soon as one
[32:02] revivals over God raises up another
[32:05] throne for lie
[32:06] keeps moving like that now we're at the
[32:09] end of this time each man has looked at
[32:11] the end of his Junction for the coming
[32:13] of Christ but they had a lots on the
[32:15] farmer to the returning of the Jews
[32:17] sighing saucers in the skies all the
[32:20] things that we see today but we are at
[32:22] the end we are here now they know the
[32:26] church was a sieve power that would work
[32:28] in the church the same works of Christ
[32:31] because as the shadow becomes deeper and
[32:34] deeper and reflects more you take a
[32:36] shade farther away to shape the least
[32:40] reflection you get out of the shade
[32:42] after a while the shade gets closer
[32:45] closer to the tree in the shade is the
[32:47] same thing now the Spirit of God has
[32:49] worked under justification under Luther
[32:51] sanctification under Wesley the baptism
[32:53] the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and GERD
[32:56] is in the last day performing and doing
[32:58] the very same things that it did when it
[33:01] was in Christ
[33:01] what is it the church in Christ has
[33:04] become one and as soon as they connect
[33:08] together that last link she will go
[33:10] through the sky shopping become Wesley
[33:13] luther all rest on back in those days
[33:15] there he that first will be last he that
[33:19] slice will be first and there will come
[33:21] the resurrection we're at the end time
[33:25] listen that's what the Holy Ghost does
[33:28] the Holy Ghost by justification ceases
[33:30] to light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by
[33:33] sanctification a little deeper shadow
[33:35] the Holy Ghost Father baptism out of it
[33:38] a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost by
[33:40] the restoration of it's very person
[33:42] being in here farming signs and wonders
[33:44] I could do it at the beginning

[35:00] years before it come here it is on the
