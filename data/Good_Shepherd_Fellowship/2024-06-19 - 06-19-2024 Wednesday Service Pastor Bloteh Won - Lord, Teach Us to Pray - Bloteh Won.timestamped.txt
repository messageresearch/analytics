[44:12] u 1 Chronicle chapter

[44:47] I 1 Chronicle chapter 7 I'm wrong 2
[44:50] Chronicle chapter 7
[45:00] 2 Chronicles chapter 7 that's a
[45:03] scripture that is very familiar to
[45:11] us Second Chronicles chapter 7 we read
[45:14] that just for the scripture reading
[45:16] tonight and then we go into what we want
[45:17] to talk about
[45:30] let's read from verse 12 and the Lord
[45:32] appeared to Solomon by night and said
[45:36] unto him I have heard that
[45:38] prayer and have chosen this place for
[45:42] myself for an House of sacrifice
[45:47] amen if I shut up heavens and there be
[45:51] no rain or if I command the locers to
[45:54] divor the land or or if I send
[45:58] pestilence among my people if my people
[46:02] which I call by my name shall humble
[46:05] themsel and pray and seek my face praise
[46:10] the
[46:11] Lord so we realize that praying and
[46:13] seeking his face is two different
[46:16] things if my people we shall call by my
[46:19] name shall humble themselves shall pray
[46:23] and seek my face and turn from the their
[46:27] Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven
[46:31] and will forgive their sins and will
[46:34] heal their
[46:37] land now my eyes shall be
[46:41] open and my ears attend unto the prayers
[46:46] that I made in this
[46:48] place
[46:50] amen father we want to ask your special
[46:53] blessings tonight as we approach your
[46:57] word come Lord speak to us what an
[47:00] awesome God you are what a wonderful
[47:02] father in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[47:05] pray amen amen while you have your seat

[47:35] the Lord
[47:38] Jesus and uh when you look in Sons of
[47:41] Solomon chapter
[47:43] five which of course I thought I will uh
[47:48] while we were reading there in uh 2
[47:52] Chronicles then my mind came to this uh
[47:56] couple of uh
[47:57] weeks back or maybe back of uh some
[47:59] months we spoke on the
[48:02] message uh seeking the face of the Lord
[48:05] or my people that are called shall seek
[48:08] my face and uh uh I had to I had this
[48:13] chapter as a second portion of that
[48:16] message and

[50:53] realize that you could bring this story
[50:55] in in uh in a picture of Christ and his
[50:59] bride you could bring the picture the
[51:01] story in a picture of Christ in his

[51:35] his
[51:36] beloved but she has already withdrawn
[51:40] from the day after everything that she
[51:43] went about doing she has withdrawn from
[51:46] the day and uh it was about night time
[51:49] she have drawn herself into where we
[51:53] would say maybe into bed or into rest
[51:57] and she locked the door and and then
[52:00] pretty soon she heard him knocking the
[52:02] door and he wanted to come in Praise the
[52:05] Lord but then uh she felt she said uh uh
[52:11] you know she heard his voice and saying
[52:13] open my sister my love and uh his hair
[52:17] filled with deal and and his coat all
[52:20] worth because of the night deal but uh
[52:24] she said I have put off my co caught and

[52:32] them and yet she's hearing her beloved
[52:35] calling to
[52:37] her and uh
[52:41] uh and her heart was moved but then when
[52:44] she took the time to go and open the
[52:47] door
[52:49] uh she uh realized that he was
[52:54] gone praise the Lord
[52:56] she was he was gone and and uh and her
[53:00] heart was broken and she went this this
[53:03] is the verse that in this uh chapter
[53:07] that really get me verse S she went into
[53:12] the street trying to find her beloved
[53:15] and and Solomon says and then the
[53:18] Washman and that went about the city
[53:22] found me you know they beat her up they
[53:26] wound her up there in some sense they
[53:29] abuse
[53:31] her trying to find her
[53:34] beloved praise the Lord and yeah she's
[53:38] calling to the daughters of Jerusalem
[53:40] when you find my beloved tell him I'm
[53:43] sake of
[53:44] love tonight I want to I want for us to
[53:48] speak
[53:50] on Lord teach us to
[53:55] pray praise Lord
[53:57] Lord Sunday we talk a little bit uh if
[54:01] we want to turn to Luke chapter
[54:05] 11 Luke chapter
[54:08] 11 I'll come back to that story that we
[54:10] have just read for Luke chapter
[54:20] 11 Luke chapter
[54:23] 11 um verse one
[54:37] and it came to pass that as he as he was
[54:41] praying in a setting
[54:43] place when he sees one of his disciples
[54:48] said unto him Lord teach us to
[54:52] pray if I would take that as a subject
[54:55] tonight Lord
[54:56] teach us to
[54:58] pray as John also taught his
[55:03] disciples praise the Lord amen many
[55:07] times as Believers or as Christians uh
[55:11] you know as people that been going to
[55:14] church you know we we uh you know we we
[55:17] start serving the lord and pray the soon
[55:20] it's easy for us to uh uh get to the
[55:24] place and think that we we have got our
[55:27] praying meted down or you know we we we
[55:31] know how to pray and I wonder how many
[55:35] times do we ask the Lord and say Lord
[55:37] teach me how to pray praise the
[55:41] Lord like we like we said on on Sunday
[55:44] if you realize that uh uh uh we we
[55:48] showed that the Lord's Prayer is both in
[55:51] the Book of Matthew chapter 6 and here
[55:54] in Luke chap 11
[55:57] they are not at the same time they are
[55:59] not at the same it's not the same even
[56:01] they are not recording the same even and
[56:05] if you also realize if you if you were
[56:08] able to look at the Lord's Prayer after
[56:10] we speak on Sunday you will realize that
[56:14] the one in Luke is different from the
[56:16] one in Matthew there is a
[56:19] difference praise the Lord and on Sunday
[56:23] I said uh uh The Lord's Prayer uh has 13
[56:28] cycles and it has 66 words that's in
[56:33] Matthew in Luke it don't have 66 words
[56:37] because in Luke there are few verses
[56:40] that are that are not that have not been
[56:42] written and if you follow the church
[56:45] history also you will realize that the
[56:48] Protestant Church head to the The Lord's
[56:51] Prayer in Matthew and the Catholic
[56:54] Church head to the Lord's Prayer in in
[56:57] Luke if you ever been around the
[57:00] Catholic uh church or being around the
[57:02] Catholic system you realize that when
[57:05] they pray the Lord's Prayer they don't
[57:07] say the last part that is in Matthew
[57:10] that kdom come I know uh uh not that
[57:14] kiddom come I'm sorry and for dine is
[57:17] the
[57:18] kingdom the power and the
[57:21] glory the the Catholics don't say that
[57:24] they say what is in Luke
[57:27] and Luke ends The Lord's Prayer lead us
[57:30] not into
[57:32] temptation but Deliver Us from
[57:36] Evil
[57:39] amen praise the
[57:42] Lord for some reason the Catholic
[57:46] adopted it used to bother me uh uh even
[57:50] even from a child because I yeah I'm not
[57:52] born a Catholic uh uh I grew up in the
[57:55] metodist home but I went to a Catholic
[57:57] school so every time we go uh into the
[58:01] chaper and they are saying the Lord's
[58:03] Prayer they always stop there uh lead us
[58:06] not into uh uh lead us lead us not into
[58:10] temptation Deliver Us from Evil amen and
[58:13] then I will continue so I was always
[58:16] think am I doing it
[58:19] wrong praise the Lord but I was a
[58:24] Protestant I was a better is protesting
[58:27] so from from child or from a young age
[58:32] not from child but from a young age that
[58:35] that that has been on my mind I could
[58:37] not tell the difference I couldn't tell
[58:39] why it was like that until until later
[58:43] it it it did not mean much to me uh real
[58:47] I would say real until this G weekend
[58:49] when I was looking at the subject to
[58:51] preach and then I say oh oh I see uh I
[58:55] see
[58:56] for the fact there is that I could tell
[58:59] the two saints were different they were
[59:02] not the same now and uh and just like we
[59:06] said on on on Sunday uh I I see what is
[59:11] giving here in in Luke's account as a
[59:14] repetition because in Matthew account
[59:18] Jesus never had any of the disciples
[59:21] coming to him to say Lord teach us how
[59:23] to pray Jesus was giving you know his
[59:27] his uh his salon on the mount on uh in
[59:30] in Matthew account that's when he gave
[59:32] the Beatitudes you know I mean Jesus on
[59:36] in Matthew account he was just like
[59:40] Moses amen he was just like Moses coming
[59:44] with the Ten
[59:45] Commandments giving the people the word
[59:48] of God for that age and that's what he
[59:50] was doing he says it is written as it is
[59:53] written in the Lord thou shall not do
[59:55] this but I say unto you that uh you know
[59:58] this is what you should do so we see him
[1:00:01] as the Lord giver and in that way he was
[1:00:04] instructing the people but here in Luke
[1:00:06] we see a complete different setting when
[1:00:09] you go back and just look at all the
[1:00:11] stories account there you will realize
[1:00:13] this is a complete different setting the
[1:00:15] Bible says he came he came out of
[1:00:18] praying as usually that he would go and
[1:00:21] I believe there with this setting what I
[1:00:24] can imagine in my mind is that the
[1:00:26] disciple realized that Jesus will always
[1:00:30] you know get away from them and and and
[1:00:32] find a time to pray you know he will
[1:00:35] find a time and sometimes when they come
[1:00:37] they will realize that he's you know
[1:00:39] that he's he's he's talking to the
[1:00:41] father he's you know he's he's praying
[1:00:43] and he's placing things before God they
[1:00:45] will have to wait and and and I believe
[1:00:48] also that they realized that the way he
[1:00:50] was talking was completely different
[1:00:53] from the way that the Jewish church or
[1:00:55] the syn God might have taught them to
[1:00:57] pray praise the Lord he was talking and
[1:01:00] he was communing it was almost like he
[1:01:02] had somebody sitting down with him and
[1:01:05] he was just talking to this person I
[1:01:07] don't believe that he was beating up the
[1:01:09] dust and he was kicking his feet I
[1:01:11] believe he was just communing he was
[1:01:13] just sitting in communion praise the
[1:01:15] Lord and I believe that it moved this it
[1:01:19] moved the disciple especially whoever
[1:01:21] was this disciple that came to him and
[1:01:23] said Lord teach us to to
[1:01:26] pray praise the Lord I believe it was
[1:01:30] remarkable I believe that it was
[1:01:33] something that uh they thought that they
[1:01:37] needed praise the Lord and you can only
[1:01:41] ask God to teach you how to pray when
[1:01:44] you feel that you need it if you think
[1:01:47] you know how to pray you will never ask
[1:01:50] God to teach you how to pray because you
[1:01:53] think you know it you don't ask somebody
[1:01:56] to teach you something that you already
[1:01:58] know praise the Lord you find many
[1:02:01] people on the job when they start to
[1:02:03] teach them you know either the shrink
[1:02:05] their shoulders and they don't pay
[1:02:07] attention because they know I already
[1:02:08] know that you're just wasting your time
[1:02:10] uh and it's not even correcting the
[1:02:12] person but sometimes it's a beautiful
[1:02:14] thing when you just act as if to say you
[1:02:16] don't know there are things that you
[1:02:18] might get there are things that you
[1:02:21] might learn there is there is always a
[1:02:24] benefit to know how to do one thing two
[1:02:26] three different
[1:02:28] ways than to just stay in your one
[1:02:32] definite way that you know many times
[1:02:36] it's a know it all Spirit when we behave
[1:02:38] like
[1:02:39] that praise the Lord
[1:02:45] amen no doubt I believe that these
[1:02:48] disciples have learned how to pray
[1:02:51] because I mean if they were good Jewish
[1:02:54] boys from 12 years old they were taught
[1:02:56] the Torah they were taught uh you know
[1:02:59] the the prayer of Moses the prayer of
[1:03:01] Abraham the prayer of Jacob they were
[1:03:03] taught all the different prayers in the
[1:03:06] scripture that uh you know that the Old
[1:03:08] Testament H for them at the time no
[1:03:11] doubt they knew how
[1:03:13] to but just like I said it was
[1:03:17] something
[1:03:18] remarkable I also believe that when it
[1:03:21] came closer there was an atmosphere
[1:03:26] that they have never
[1:03:31] failed and they asking how is said when
[1:03:34] he prayed it looked so sacred it looked
[1:03:38] so
[1:03:45] real praise the
[1:03:48] Lord so tonight if the Lord as we trust
[1:03:51] the Lord to help us we want
[1:03:54] to we want to ask the Lord to teach us
[1:03:58] how to
[1:03:59] pray
[1:04:03] amen I feel now to ask the Lord all the
[1:04:06] time to teach me how to
[1:04:10] pray because I always
[1:04:14] believe there
[1:04:18] is we all need a better way to get
[1:04:21] closer to the Lord Brother brandom said
[1:04:24] that's the reason why we come to church
[1:04:27] to be
[1:04:29] better to be better than what we were
[1:04:33] today amen we trust that the service
[1:04:37] will make us better than what we wear
[1:04:39] today or what we wear yesterday he said
[1:04:43] for us to be better husbands to our
[1:04:45] wives and better wives to our husband
[1:04:47] better parents to our children better
[1:04:50] children to our parents better uh H uh
[1:04:53] Neighbors in our neighborhood better
[1:04:55] workers at the job and that's what the
[1:04:58] presence of God is for is to make us
[1:05:02] better and there is one desire that we
[1:05:06] should have when we go to the house of
[1:05:08] the Lord is to be
[1:05:10] better praise the Lord amen and when we
[1:05:15] have that desire to be better the word
[1:05:17] of God never comes we we never get
[1:05:20] offended at the word praise the Lord
[1:05:23] because how can you get offended
[1:05:26] when your desire is to be better how
[1:05:29] will you get better if the word don't
[1:05:33] correct you if the word don't instruct
[1:05:36] you how you going to get
[1:05:41] better praise the
[1:05:45] Lord so so uh and and and and and the
[1:05:50] way that I look at I look at uh sons of
[1:05:53] Solomon Chapter 5 for for a long time
[1:05:57] I'm having one of my old Bible where I
[1:05:59] read the whole sons of Solomon many
[1:06:02] years back uh uh uh in the AR coast and
[1:06:05] if you look in the Bible you will see
[1:06:07] where I put the
[1:06:09] bridegroom when when when one verse is
[1:06:11] reading to the other one when it comes
[1:06:13] to the bride and I put the bride and I
[1:06:15] read down when I think it's the
[1:06:17] bridegroom that is talking I put the
[1:06:19] bridegroom and and and you know that's I
[1:06:21] did a beautiful uh uh Bible reading
[1:06:24] through the Book of Solomon and that
[1:06:26] chapter has stuck with meaning and and
[1:06:29] the way that I I I think about that
[1:06:31] chapter I've always apply it to my
[1:06:34] prayer
[1:06:36] life praise the Lord Revelation chapter
[1:06:39] 3 uh uh Jesus said behold I stand at the
[1:06:43] door and
[1:06:44] knock If any man open and yeah the
[1:06:46] bridegroom was knocking at the
[1:06:50] door he was knocking at the door to come
[1:06:53] in and if you read the verses before you
[1:06:56] realize he has brought gifts he had
[1:06:58] given the bride a lot of gifts and now
[1:07:02] she got so consumed in the
[1:07:05] gifts and yet The Giver was at the back
[1:07:08] of the
[1:07:09] door praise the Lord trying to come in
[1:07:13] so they can enjoy the gift together and
[1:07:17] that is the condition of the
[1:07:20] church the church get so attracted to
[1:07:24] you know the good preacher the good
[1:07:25] music and and and uh manifestation
[1:07:29] whether it is praying and and our prayer
[1:07:31] being answered or you know we want to do
[1:07:33] this thing for God and you know we we we
[1:07:36] we we get so excited it looks like we
[1:07:39] want gifts more than the
[1:07:41] giver praise the Lord but if we can have
[1:07:45] the giver we have all the gift amen am
[1:07:48] praise the Lord so she she's there and
[1:07:52] then and after she's finished enjoying
[1:07:55] all the gifts y say she creep to her bed
[1:07:58] she got to her rest she have washed her
[1:08:01] feet and she have taken us her cting and
[1:08:04] I mean she's uh she's coing in her bed
[1:08:07] and yeah the bridegroom comes a time for
[1:08:10] communion a time of fellowship and then
[1:08:12] he come and then he's calling to her but
[1:08:15] she just oh man no I mean I'm I'm too
[1:08:17] tired I was busy the whole day I'm too
[1:08:20] tired and and I believe that is the
[1:08:23] place where the church is fing
[1:08:27] praise the Lord that is the place where
[1:08:30] the church is
[1:08:32] feeling because we get so busy and we
[1:08:35] just have a little time for prayer we
[1:08:39] have a little time for
[1:08:41] communion and because we think we have
[1:08:45] our prayer session down or our word of
[1:08:49] praying down and and and and the things
[1:08:51] that we need to say to God to be able to
[1:08:54] fulfill our prayer life or our prayer
[1:08:58] what whatever we want to term it to be
[1:09:02] it put us in that place that I mean we
[1:09:03] can just run through a Lord thank you no
[1:09:06] blessing and we just we just get through
[1:09:11] it praise the Lord and here it said
[1:09:14] there after she kept hearing the
[1:09:17] knocking and she kept hearing and you
[1:09:20] know feeling in her heart that uh the
[1:09:24] the the the love need to have some
[1:09:26] communion with her like sometime we feel
[1:09:29] in our heart and we just you feel a
[1:09:31] little bit condemned or you feel a
[1:09:33] little bit not not most in a sense of
[1:09:35] feeling condemned but you just feel like
[1:09:38] you feel that unrest you know like
[1:09:40] brother Bram said in Christ is the
[1:09:42] Myster of God revealed he says that's
[1:09:44] the reason why we feel that way he says
[1:09:47] because it is Christ that is trying to
[1:09:50] draw you into communion and sometimes we
[1:09:53] get distracted we think oh we need to do
[1:09:55] days for you know for us to get
[1:09:57] satisfied and when you get it done you
[1:09:59] stay feel that unrest and you have to
[1:10:01] take care of this and you get it done
[1:10:03] you say feed that unrest he said all of
[1:10:05] those things are just distraction
[1:10:07] because the main thing is just God
[1:10:10] trying to get your attention for a
[1:10:16] minute if we would just
[1:10:20] stop and say dear Lord I don't know
[1:10:22] what's going on my mind mind is just
[1:10:28] going please help
[1:10:32] me praise the
[1:10:36] Lord and that's how she felted and
[1:10:38] quickly she got off her bed the cat that
[1:10:41] she did not wanted to put on she got the
[1:10:43] coat and then and then the feet that was
[1:10:46] already washed she put the feet on the
[1:10:48] ground and she when she went outside he
[1:10:50] was
[1:10:52] gone praise the Lord amen
[1:10:56] then she start running to every Revival
[1:10:58] and start going to every
[1:11:00] denomination and she got in the hands of
[1:11:03] the ones that supposed to be the
[1:11:04] Watchmen the
[1:11:06] preachers praise the Lord and they tell
[1:11:09] her about a 24 days program a 12 days
[1:11:12] program a fasting and praying program a
[1:11:15] Women program a online program and and
[1:11:18] all of these
[1:11:20] program and when she come out of it
[1:11:23] she's so confused
[1:11:26] why because as all people are running
[1:11:28] after
[1:11:31] result running after result running from
[1:11:35] one prayer B to another prayer uh group
[1:11:38] and to another
[1:11:40] thing just looking for some kind of a h
[1:11:45] uh uh spiritual catch
[1:11:52] up praise the Lord
[1:11:56] when the scripture says the Lord is even
[1:11:59] n thee that's what the Bible says he's
[1:12:05] NY if we will confess with our mouth and
[1:12:08] believe with our
[1:12:10] heart he's that's how so close he
[1:12:16] is that's how so
[1:12:21] close now the church has got our spirit
[1:12:25] so mess up the other preachers said
[1:12:27] that's the way you have to pray you know
[1:12:29] you got to imagine Jesus Christ you know
[1:12:31] you got to put the Huffman picture there
[1:12:33] you got to keep that picture in your
[1:12:35] mind you know and and the other person
[1:12:36] said no this is the way you have to pray
[1:12:39] and the other person said and it have
[1:12:41] just made our spirit you know the
[1:12:43] biggest part of the H bin that is messed
[1:12:46] up is our
[1:12:48] spirit praise the Lord because right
[1:12:52] from growing
[1:12:53] up I mean could going into a lot of
[1:12:56] things tonight and just get out of out
[1:12:58] of the way right from growing up all of
[1:13:01] the things that we have seen we have
[1:13:04] heard that we have gone
[1:13:07] through it resides right in our
[1:13:11] spirit praise the
[1:13:14] Lord and that is the reason why
[1:13:17] sometimes you misunderstand people when
[1:13:19] they say things to you it's because your
[1:13:22] spirit is so draving to to understand
[1:13:25] think this way that no matter how easy
[1:13:29] or how they try to say because your
[1:13:33] spirit is so driven that is the most
[1:13:36] complex part of the
[1:13:38] human it's our spirit
[1:13:44] man praise the
[1:13:46] Lord that is the most complex part of
[1:13:51] the
[1:13:52] human is our spirit
[1:13:56] why because that is the place that is
[1:13:58] what is birthed between Eve and the sep
[1:14:01] your soul is not birth from Eve and the
[1:14:04] sein
[1:14:07] amen praise the
[1:14:12] Lord are we
[1:14:16] together now so she's being abused she's
[1:14:19] being robbed by all these Watchers of
[1:14:21] the night and all the keepers of the
[1:14:24] night night why think about it why if
[1:14:27] she have just get off her bed that night
[1:14:31] get down and open the
[1:14:33] door praise the Lord why if she have
[1:14:37] just make that little attempt and just
[1:14:40] get in communion with
[1:14:52] God are we together tonight
[1:14:56] oh Lord teach us how to
[1:15:00] pray praise the Lord when you
[1:15:04] read church
[1:15:06] history you'll realize that there are
[1:15:10] two things that brings Revival to a
[1:15:15] people is praying and
[1:15:20] repentance praise the Lord amen when the
[1:15:24] people real get down to praying it
[1:15:27] prepared their heart it prepared them to
[1:15:30] let go it prepared them to put them in a
[1:15:34] place of
[1:15:37] repentance and when the people gu to
[1:15:41] that
[1:15:42] place praise the Lord amen then God is
[1:15:47] ready to move on the scene for the
[1:15:52] people the Revival is not the three days
[1:15:55] service the Revival is how much the
[1:15:58] heart of the people willing to commune
[1:16:01] with
[1:16:01] God praise the Lord just like brother
[1:16:05] Bram said like the ocean will do its
[1:16:07] Revival you know he says there's not
[1:16:10] additional water that is adding to the
[1:16:12] ocean is just going through that to be
[1:16:14] able to PCH itself of all the dirt that
[1:16:17] is in
[1:16:18] it so Lord teach us how to
[1:16:22] pray teach us how to pray see see what
[1:16:25] brother Brandon will say yet in message
[1:16:27] Supernatural he says prayer is a sincere
[1:16:32] thing I'm going try to take my time
[1:16:35] tonight if I we don't get through we
[1:16:37] always have uh other days to continue
[1:16:40] amen prayer is a sincere thing prayer is
[1:16:45] talking to
[1:16:48] God praise the Lord Prayer is talking to
[1:16:53] God Amen many times we are talking to
[1:16:59] ourself praise the Lord but yet God
[1:17:03] hears
[1:17:05] us the reason why I said we are talking
[1:17:08] to ourself is because we having so much
[1:17:12] of ourself on our
[1:17:15] mind praise the
[1:17:19] Lord this very thing we are praying
[1:17:21] about we are thinking about so many
[1:17:23] different ways to go about without
[1:17:26] it and yet we are
[1:17:30] praying praise the
[1:17:34] lord the devil knows that how your
[1:17:37] spirit is birthed between him and your
[1:17:40] first
[1:17:42] birth so the moment you get down to pray
[1:17:45] he gets in your
[1:17:47] spirit he start to he start to mess your
[1:17:50] mind up and put your mind on everything
[1:17:53] he knows how to to play on that
[1:17:56] ground praise the Lord he knows how to
[1:18:00] play on that ground and I can say to you
[1:18:02] tonight that he he has he has more he
[1:18:05] has more access or more control to that
[1:18:08] ground more influence to that ground
[1:18:10] than you
[1:18:17] have but prayer is talking to God
[1:18:25] prayer is not get down shut your
[1:18:28] eyes and
[1:18:30] thinking about Wasing all your work you
[1:18:34] are
[1:18:36] doing praise the Lord
[1:18:40] amen the thing about it there if prayer
[1:18:43] you don't have to close your eyes to
[1:18:47] pray there is no scriptural requirement
[1:18:50] that say close your eyes and pray the
[1:18:53] only reason why I think we CL close our
[1:18:55] eyes to pray is to
[1:18:58] avoid
[1:19:00] distraction praise the Lord
[1:19:04] hallelujah and because the devil knows
[1:19:07] that you want to avoid distraction from
[1:19:09] your physical seeing sense he gets in
[1:19:13] your spirit he gets in your
[1:19:19] mind that's the only reason why we close
[1:19:21] our eyes
[1:19:25] I I see I see I I see many men and I
[1:19:28] know many men I have a good friend of
[1:19:30] mine I I've tried to do that I just can
[1:19:33] do it but this guy I I mean we were good
[1:19:35] friends you know what in the morning he
[1:19:37] would leave me when I'm praying he will
[1:19:39] leave me inside and he go outside I mean
[1:19:41] he he goes outside he walk around 5:30
[1:19:44] in the morning he will walk and and I
[1:19:46] mean that is the best time of praying he
[1:19:50] can ever have he walks around with his
[1:19:53] eyes open he walks in and I mean he he
[1:19:56] just have a good time I tried I
[1:20:04] can praise the
[1:20:07] Lord so it's more than just closing your
[1:20:10] eyes is dealing with your distraction
[1:20:13] whether your eyes is closed or your eyes
[1:20:16] is
[1:20:18] open praise the Lord
[1:20:33] Hallelujah so you see many of a men that
[1:20:36] that they have trained thems they have
[1:20:39] trained how to gear himself in the
[1:20:42] spirit and if you are not trained close
[1:20:44] your
[1:20:46] eyes praise the
[1:20:49] Lord amen because you also dealing with
[1:20:52] Spirit especially in the assembly
[1:20:54] especially especially when people being
[1:20:55] pray
[1:20:57] for our children must be taught to close
[1:21:00] their
[1:21:01] eyes because they are
[1:21:03] kids they don't deal with
[1:21:06] Spirits are we together but that's the
[1:21:09] major reason why I think we close our
[1:21:16] eyes prayer is not get down short your
[1:21:18] eyes and thinking about your watching or
[1:21:21] your work you are doing say Lord help me
[1:21:24] and John and and he Mr Jones and so
[1:21:28] forth he said that's not
[1:21:30] prayer that's repeating some
[1:21:36] words praise the Lord can we say Lord
[1:21:40] teach me to
[1:21:42] pray
[1:21:46] amen don't worry if you can't say it you
[1:21:49] will learn to say
[1:21:51] it I'll tell you don't feel unless you
[1:21:54] don't feel you the need to learn learn
[1:21:56] from the Lord how to pray but prayer is
[1:21:59] to come into an atmosphere where you
[1:22:02] realize that you are in the presence of
[1:22:06] God and you are
[1:22:09] moving to then in the deepest of
[1:22:13] sincerity so sometimes when we first Get
[1:22:16] Down On Our Knees we have not even
[1:22:19] started because until you can get your
[1:22:22] spirit under control and get your mind
[1:22:25] Center on
[1:22:30] God and you are just warming of the
[1:22:34] Angel praise the Lord because that
[1:22:38] flight is not going to take
[1:22:41] up until you get every distraction out
[1:22:44] of the
[1:22:46] way praise the
[1:22:49] Lord
[1:22:52] amen until you get very distraction and
[1:22:55] look at look at the beauty here the Lord
[1:22:58] says that before you even open your
[1:23:00] mouth he knows what you want to say
[1:23:04] before you ask him so you should realize
[1:23:08] that he's not looking for your many
[1:23:10] words he's looking for your
[1:23:16] attention he's looking for your
[1:23:20] attention how much you are focused on
[1:23:23] him
[1:23:24] because he already know what you want to
[1:23:27] say he know beyond what you want to say
[1:23:30] the Bible says we in ourself we don't
[1:23:33] even know how to pray it's our spirit
[1:23:35] that
[1:23:51] grown praise the Lord
[1:23:54] is our spirit are grown within
[1:23:58] us it's coming into an atmosphere where
[1:24:01] you realize that you are in the presence
[1:24:02] of God and you are moving today in the
[1:24:05] deepest of sincerity the first thing you
[1:24:07] say first you say a little worship oh
[1:24:11] Jehovah Our
[1:24:16] Father how I love
[1:24:20] you praise the Lord that's how you warm
[1:24:23] up the angel
[1:24:25] that's how you get your mind on God by
[1:24:28] praising him Lord I love you I thank you
[1:24:32] you've been so good to me trying to get
[1:24:36] your mind on him and thinking about his
[1:24:38] goodness and his Mercy In by his
[1:24:42] grace not just blessing God with all
[1:24:45] your needs Lord I really need you right
[1:24:47] now that I need you right now and and
[1:24:50] and and and and sometimes our mind is
[1:24:52] not even on that right now
[1:24:55] is not as as as life and death to
[1:25:07] Us Praise the
[1:25:14] Lord first you say a little worship oh
[1:25:17] Jehovah how I love
[1:25:20] you you see then then after the worship
[1:25:24] of
[1:25:26] prayer after the worship of
[1:25:29] prayer then you come with a sincere
[1:25:32] heart
[1:25:34] asking praise the
[1:25:36] Lord so when you take it back to the
[1:25:39] Lord's
[1:25:40] Prayer Jesus was not giving us a
[1:25:43] recitation he was teaching us a
[1:25:46] principle how to approach the father
[1:25:55] our
[1:25:58] father my Lord and my
[1:26:01] God praise the
[1:26:03] Lord making him a present tense making
[1:26:08] him one that is so close not one that is
[1:26:12] distant not one that is in the past not
[1:26:16] the one in the future to come but making
[1:26:18] him so present
[1:26:24] praise the
[1:26:26] Lord then he says when you have made him
[1:26:29] present then worship Him Hallowed be thy
[1:26:34] name that's what brother Bram called a
[1:26:36] worship of prayer where you can Praise
[1:26:39] Him and thank him and appreciate
[1:26:44] him for his love and for his mercy and
[1:26:47] for his
[1:26:49] grace praise the Lord oh I tell you when
[1:26:53] you get into pra praising God and really
[1:26:56] praising God you know what it does It
[1:26:59] cast all those evil spirit that is
[1:27:01] battling your mind it start creating an
[1:27:04] atmosphere why because the Angels start
[1:27:07] flopping their wings they start coming
[1:27:09] closer because Jehovah is now inhabiting
[1:27:13] the praise of his his son or the praise
[1:27:16] of his daughter because he inhabit the
[1:27:18] Praises of his people
[1:27:26] you want get over your mind battle in
[1:27:28] prayer learn to praise God spend more
[1:27:31] time praising and worshiping him and
[1:27:34] appreciating
[1:27:38] him praise the

[1:42:00] tonight before we pray and be gone
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:15] home when you feel that call to your
[1:42:19] heart to pray
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:27] you have to
[1:42:28] realize that is the greatest invitation
[1:42:31] you will ever
[1:42:35] have the devil will never call to your
[1:42:38] heart to pray he don't even want you to
[1:42:42] pray he will never give you a desire to
[1:42:47] pray if you feel
[1:42:50] that call to your heart to pray
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:42:57] if you never feel a call to your heart
[1:42:59] to
[1:43:02] pray then you really need to be at the
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:07] altar if you go through an entire day
[1:43:11] and you don't feel a call to you heart
[1:43:13] to
[1:43:15] pray sometimes you can be at
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:21] work and you feed a c to your heart to
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:26] pray brother bam talks about Stonewall
[1:43:29] Jackson he said that's the reason why
[1:43:31] they call him Stonewall Jackson he said
[1:43:34] because right in the midst of a fight or
[1:43:36] in the midst of a
[1:43:38] battle when he feel that n to pray he
[1:43:41] will stand right there not hearing
[1:43:44] what's going on around him he would take
[1:43:46] his heart off lay it on his chest and
[1:43:50] say a word to the Lord
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:59] because
[1:44:01] after the Holy Spirit tried to win your
[1:44:04] heart to
[1:44:05] pray and if you are not giving
[1:44:10] he you might not feed
[1:44:12] it you will just get in your religious
[1:44:16] activity before you go to bed you say
[1:44:18] your little prayer you get up in the
[1:44:20] morning you knee down you say your fast
[1:44:22] prayer and and uh uh uh and in the night
[1:44:25] you say your fast prayer you just get
[1:44:27] into a fast praying moment but you
[1:44:30] really not having communion with
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:37] God you're not having communion with God
[1:44:41] why because many times he tried to lose
[1:44:45] your
[1:44:47] heart but you get so busy so many things
[1:44:50] on your mind so many things you have to
[1:44:53] do that you don't even
[1:44:57] feel you don't you don't feel it in
[1:45:03] you and you have to you have to realize
[1:45:06] that that when you lost feelings it kill
[1:45:11] any form of
[1:45:13] relationship when you lost
[1:45:16] feeling when you lost feelings for your
[1:45:18] parents you lost feelings for your
[1:45:20] spouse you lost feelings for your
[1:45:22] friends it killed the
[1:45:28] relationship so if you are not feeling
[1:45:30] if you if you don't feel it in your
[1:45:33] heart you need to take your heart to God
[1:45:36] you need to you need to

[1:45:41] you have you have you have grieved the
[1:45:43] holy
[1:45:45] spirit that he he's he can't even come
[1:45:48] by to touch your heart
[1:45:53] God don't wait for you to go to bed
[1:45:55] before he touch your
