now come father lord him and bless us lord then [Music] break your word to us tonight we thank you jesus in your wonderful name we pray amen [Music] amen [Music] amen you know the scripture says that uh when jesus walked with those men on the road of emmaus they did not recognize him he talked to them until in the evening time and when he paid him to come and they were about to eat the bible says he took the bread and he broke it and the eyes were open you know brother branham has used their scripture and talk about the breaking of the bread and and apply a lot of spiritual significance to the breaking of the bread which of course we know the breaking of the bread has a lot of spiritual significance as he broke the bread their eyes open but there is there is another thing also when you when you think about it you just you just meditate upon it i was i was thinking meditating upon that and you realize that when jesus took the bread there was uh there was a physical element there was a physical element that identified him and that physical element was the skies on his hands when he took the bread to break it definitely when the person is breaking bread with their hands all eyes goes on the hands there's a song of fanny crosby but branham talks about it as i know him i shall know him brother branham said she got struck with the inspiration of that song when some of the markers and scoffers were trying to criticize her thinking about jesus and yes she was a blind woman and he says fanning how will you know him she says i shall know him i shall know him by the print of his nails the nails cast in his hands praise the lord amen that is the only human thing that is the only man may think that would be in heaven the nail scans because the newscasts are made me that's the only man may think that makes immortality is the nail print praise the lord amen amen the lord bless you tonight thank you musicians if the lord bless us we might do uh singing at the end of the service but let's uh take our bibles tonight and trust the lord to be able to help us and uh before we read the word and there's a testimony here from from our dear sister beer she want to thank the lord she brought prayer requests for her dad on sunday we we pray for him and uh he visited with us on on on easter and then uh how to to travel back let's just read the word so i won't keep you standing long in and you know i i do those things i'm quick to forget about things i want to say and then uh but let's just read the word matthew chapter five let's read matthew chapter five praise the lord matthew chapter five matthew chapter 5 let's read from verse 17 matthew chapter 5 let's read from verse 17. think that that i am come to destroy the lord all the prophets i am not come to this to destroy but to fulfill for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one job or one tattoo shall shall in no wise pass from the lord till all be fulfilled let's pray together father we have just read your sacred word and we want to ask blessing upon it tonight father we remember those that are now with us tonight jesus and we just ask that your grace will be with them especially the once lord i have to work we pray that god father you will be with them at work lord jesus oh dear god you know father how it hurts some of the house of your children lord the father god they will have to be a work lord away from church but father we ask that you give grace to god dear lord we just pray that father you will just come and meet with us tonight and bless lord father the invisible audience of god those that are streaming from their home as well father we commit ourself in your hands dear lord we are needed people we pray the father oh god come lord jesus make the service meaningful to us tonight lord we thank you father we praise you lord jesus dear lord we prayed also father for brother david and laura smith lord jesus that just returned from uh bearing sister laura's dead and we just commit them into your hands we pray that god you will be with them or father dear lord and we just we we need you father god we need you lord jesus more than ever father we pray bless us together tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed you may have your seed praise the lord so uh as we we were trying to testify here uh uh about sister pierre's daddy and uh like i said she told to us that he was around so we felt that it would be good for him to come in and fellowship with us just to get to know him and praise the lord and so he came and he he really had a good time praise the lord you know he really had a good time he stayed there with brother brother bannon you know but ben was telling me you know he wakes up early in the morning he goes for his walk and you know he jog you or you see him looking like a strong young man amen praise the lord amen but uh uh i also noticed that he was using a hearing aid which sister bearer told me that her brother you know bought that for him because he had he was developing problem with his hearing and then he went home and uh we got a prayer request on sunday to pray for him and which of course we did year then and she called me today testifying that the lord touched her father and his will amen praise the lord and not only that he's well but uh the lord has has has blessed him and instead of the hearing aid helping him hearing it is disturbing his hearing because he's hearing better than using a hearing aid praise the lord [Applause] amen the lord the lord has the lord has made his hearing better amen amen and you know the way god built the human body is that the hearing influenced the talking when you are losing your hearing your talking starts to become blurred if you sticks around people that do sign language you will understand and most of them that were not born that way but starts to use sign language because they start losing their their their hearing and that's that's exactly what happened you know so uh uh she said she heard her dad sounding so clear and and he says every time he put the hearing aid in his ears is just bothering him is making a lot of noise so we want to thank the lord for that you know we want to thank the lord for that and you know and i was our sister was she was telling me that uh you know she she actually been been praying and asking why you know we we granted the offer for her dad to come in and fellowship with us for me i just wanted to see him maybe god had other reasons but for me i just wanted to get to know him praise the lord and then she itself i mean she was she was thinking and you know just praying lord is that a reason and another thing and and she felt blessing of her to know that uh you know uh the reason was to help him with his hearing praise the lord so we thank the lord for that you know we thank the lord for that and uh uh praise the lord you know sister she's she's a quiet quiet woman but she's a very prayerful woman and there are there are other things that i will keep to myself i mean there are a lot of things that she have told me and they have just come to pass just like that just like they are one after another and uh i mean uh yeah so you know we thank the lord and you realize all the time i had to i had to read two dreams year in in church which of course there were three dreams but they were just back to back in and from two different persons that don't even know one another because i think associate names with that you know uh and and and you know spiritual things must be guided if you realize i don't play with spiritual things when things are spiritual they must be guided praise the lord amen and uh and and that's the way i deal with spiritual things because many of the time you know that when god starts to to help a church or starts to help an individual when uh when when when that gift is not guarded or whatever god is doing in their home or their family or their individual life if it's not guarded you know when one satan is going to attack death and two you know uh uh you know the flesh can get in it and when the flesh gets in it then it stinks in god's nose you don't want to have anything to do with it because he had his god in the flesh praise the lord amen so uh uh there are things i will tell you but i will tell you in the future but it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen amen it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight and uh tomorrow my wife and myself we will get another anniversary so we thank the lord for for keeping us keeping us praise the lord you know i was you know when you when you have a thought on your mind you become so anxious to preach but i should have kept my message what brother branham said his wife's tool between him and the public i should have preached it tonight it would have been a fitting message for tonight praise the lord amen i proposed to my wife on february 25th 2000 you know uh the wives keep the wedding date but the man we keep the night we propose praise the lord the wedding did it for the woman the day that we choose to propose we keep there is very special to us so it was it was february 25th 2000 about maybe about around 5 45 in the evening i still remember because i was going to seal my life i praise the lord so but the lord has been good to us the lord has been good to us uh uh we we win now about uh uh six years uh then before we got married and so uh i mean there were just there were just a lot of things that were happening there not things contrary to the word but circumstances were coming up for which that we we couldn't do our wedding i was a pastor in the small church and i wanted to do my wedding on the dedication of that church we just built a building i was thinking about i was thinking about blowing the photos but i just didn't have time to do it before service to now i was going to show you the church that we were building small uh village church so we were hoping to do do the dedication that year i wanted to do it december and then uh we were going to do our wedding but then the the wall came and okay just after we finished praying i received a word that my brother joe admitted out of surgery everything went well praise god thank you for continuing prayers as he recovered from a 12-hour surgery praise the lord we want to thank the lord for that amen amen praise the lord we want to thank the lord for that so yeah and uh i mean so that's that's how we've been going on praise the lord amen and and i want to i just thank the lord for for everything his grace is doing for us and uh so just just continue to pray for us amen we need your prayers but tonight i want to talk on something uh uh maybe i could talk on marriage tonight but i'm not i might be in the flesh if i do that praise the lord amen amen tonight i want to speak on on something that we read from the message the restoration of the bride tree i read a quote of brother branham did and then we would take a talk that we want to talk on i've actually been studying on speaking on the rejected king and actually uh when brother brandon preached the message the rejected king you know what the the inspiration that was behind that message that brother brennan preached was the rejection of the word the rejection of the leadership when people reject the leadership of the holy spirit praise the lord amen there was that was that was what was under the message he preached you know because but when we get there when we get there we will look at it because we will be looking at the the different the different gifts that god has designed to lead his people praise the lord amen so uh uh and and there you will understand why it have to be one man that's god design you never have two kings in the kingdom amen you don't have a king and an assistant king or a vice king it does not work like that that's the reason why there is no human government will become successful even the the countries that are stayed practicing uh uh you know a kind of a monarchy form of government that i it has become so corrupted right because even the kingship is supposed to be honor god praise the lord even the kingship supposed to be on a god sure praise the lord so i mean in in everything you you come even to the family life you know no two men must rule the same home there is one man to a home but that man will not be successful until he comes under the leadership of god when it comes to a church there is no true pastor in the church there is one man that is set over the church and again we will not be successful until that man is subjected to the leadership of the holy spirit so when we get there there are a lot of things that we will learn and we pray that the lord will help us amen but let's look at this tonight this is this is like a faith a faith building message like like the prophet will say so for the prayer meeting tonight let's look at this brother branham said there's a lord there's a lord oh if i ever get to my text praise the lord you know people uh brother branham was not a scholar amen brother branham was not a scholar uh uh uh you know so sometimes people uh uh uh you know uh they get they get things all mixed up you know brother branham was a prophet he was a prophet and it's just like a preacher glory be to god amen you know the lord has simple way that he he answered our prayers i would say that i wanted to testify about it i forgot and uh you know i was i was in the office you know and i was i was just praying and uh you know my brother hillary clinton you know the the man of god wanted for us to learn this song you know and then sometimes he would say we called the humble servant of god you know you so i was just there i was praying i said lord let brother hillary just say brother warren come up tonight and then he says i call brother one i said thank you jesus simple praying praise the lord oh my goodness when he when he called me humble seven then i really need to be humble i feel like crying to come to the pulpit and every time i say i will call this brother and he says just call me brother warren and then i forget you know but the lord just did it tonight himself so let's let's get to our talk tonight praise the lord there's a law oh if i ever get to my text there's a lord there's a lord giving among everything and that's my message tonight there's a lord giving among everything to everything there is a lord and what is the lord giving for the lord is the governing power of that thing the lord is giving to govern whatever god put in place amen he put a law in that thing the law that he puts in the sun that's what makes the sun to come up set go down no one running there to move the sun amen it's the law that god put in it like brother branham said if i'll ever get to my text you realize that there are things that brother branham preach and he speak about i mean it it blows the mind off of educated people they argue about it and fuss about it why because it's coming from an electric man but it's not an electric man you see it's god god choosing a vessel and god putting a man in a place that the things that he would do through that man just like he said to simon flesh and blood has not relayed this to you you can both of it you can attribute it to yourself praise the lord that's the reason why brother branham did not attribute those things to himself it's people that are trying to make him what he did not even make himself and that's what we have to be careful about because i believe with all of my heart if brother branham will stay here he will frown many things that people are saying about him and many things that people are i i you know want to do of him but let's go to the word here there is a lord giving among everything everything there is a lot now and if you think about it you look at the ordinance giving to israel the commandment the statutes and that's the reason why paul says and is proving throughout the scripture that no flesh can fulfill the law because the lord was not giving for you it was not giving for us the law was not giving as a rule for us to do to be right the lord was giving because god set his governance in the lord as we go along you will understand what i mean by that i'm trying to find the best word to express myself but to everything there is a lord praise the lord and he goes on he says you know a fish has a law and that fish can stand up here in water and he has a law within him praise the lord now you see uh uh uh what man in science has done you know the people that build submarines and and and and and the people that that are trained to to to dive on the water and in in every equipment that they have made to be able to make a man to go on a waterfall more than five minutes or more than you know an hour and and everything can and carry that his camera and carry whatever he carries there everything that they have built man has been able to study god's creation they take a fish and steady the fish so well they study every part of the fish and from there they get their inspiration to be able to make an equipment that a man can either put himself in or the man can put to his nose so the man can put on his body and then he can be able to go under the water and be and and swim just like a fish what are they doing they are studying the law of god that keeps a creature on the water praise the lord i listened to this message and and uh i got i got caught up with uh uh uh i got caught up with the design of a bird because you know vert bearing talks about the bird and i didn't know that the fish would come before the birds so uh uh there were some things i wanted to look at on fish and uh to be able to bring this to you tonight but we just we're just beginning this we might be able to take a few times because there is there is something that we want to get to there is something that we want to achieve by by bringing this to you amen he said you know a fish has a lot and that fish can stand up here in water and he has a lot within him you see the law to everything that god made is not out of that thing the law is in him if we just take an example there's a law of life within us praise the lord if there should come a huge noise across the street that comes through this building everybody is going to shake a little bit we want to know what is happening out there because we want to get away why we want to get away from danger is because we want to live praise the lord why why we we when we get sick we want the lord to heal us i believe by the grace of god we are not afraid of hell amen it's not because we believe that when we die we will go to hell no all that's one other thing that the new breadth of takes away from you it takes away the fear of hell because him that is in christ there is no condemnation unto him he has passed from death on to life and because there is a law of life in our body that's the reason why we want to live yes when we get sick we we just feel so bad and and oh my goodness i i just hate this sickness because we want to live you see so the law of everything god placed that law with anything there is not a law outside governing you see that is the reason why when that when the new birth comes it gives you a law for a higher kingdom it puts it in you now if you have a church rule that says don't do this we don't do the in the message we don't do all of those laws they are extended law that's the reason why you can feel offended when people are trying to law over you because it's not coming from within praise the lord lord be to god the fish does not have to worry whether the water that is swimming in is going to finish it don't thinks about it it does not even come to the mind of the fish praise the lord it does not come to the mind of the fish fish have never taught one bay to say that this water that i'm aiming is is is going to it's going to drain up one of these day i might wake up and there will be no water for me to swim it does not comes to the intelligence of the fish praise the lord because there is a lord in that fish that tells the fish this is the only place that you can live right the life you have in you is comfortable in this place game only exists in this place that's why fish do not makes plans with their children for them to move in the desert they don't make plans with their family and say let's let's go on lane and leave maybe one of these days the water is going to dry up it don't come to their mind why because the lord in them drives them it governs them to think that this is the best place in the world to live the law that is in them makes them to be so pleased are we together there is a law in everything praise the lord there is a lord in everything or if if the lord can just open our heart beyond what a preacher can say and just make this so real even to the little kids amen oh you were just falling in love with jesus praise the lord you would just you would just love him glory be to god i was stepping with a little bit here and uh working you know where you know where ladies are they're always talking about some some kind of cream and different things and then there was a composition that came up and they were talking about uh how you call it now it says sun cream to keep yourself from sunburned and sunstream you know they were talking about that in and i was in the office and i was listening to daddy and the conversation came out and you know when one of the guys says well we don't have to think about that and uh and the manager says well you know i might you know my husband have to use it there's a young there's a there's a gentleman there he says he says he says uh uh you know i don't have to worry about it you know i've never used that in my life so a conversation came up and i saw where they were going so i decided to step out of the office and talk to them a little bit and and i just and and as soon as i i came out because you know uh uh you know that i don't i don't i don't you know get into their talk but as soon as i came out the manager saw me and so she decided to ask me the question i said no i don't i don't i don't use that she says wow it makes me to to start to want to learn something she said really i said yeah oh you know well i've i don't use it i've i don't i don't think my wife use it and she says wow now so where we were trying to get to in a conversation and i was trying to help them to see if that you know uh the complexion of other people when they are exposed to the sun too much it might affect him the complexion of other people think about people that lives close to the equator what is very hot they don't use some stream now i told them i says but this is this is word this is where it becomes interesting when people that are used to hot weather try to kill the cells of their body because they want to change the complexion of their skin and become like somebody that have a lighter complexion that's where they get their cancer from because they are breaking the cells on their body because they don't want the kind of a dark color skin like i have they want a lighter color scheme that's where they they develop skin cancer from and i mean it was just you know it just it's it became so quiet just like you are quiet and i told him let me step in my office i don't want to preach [Music] but you see i say there to say there is a law in everything there is a law in everything glory be to god tonight amy i'm trying to hold myself because it's a subject i could run with tonight but i'm trying my best to hold myself you know and then and brother branham go on and he talks about the face he said if he just if he if he would just let go of that law that's in him he can sink plumb to the bottom of the sea all he has to do is to allow the law to work through his body he just have to let go let the law that governs him get ahold of him it's not him controlling the lord but let the lord get ahold of him or he can go to the bottom of the sea praise the lord you cannot tell a fish that he would drown have you ever heard a fish drown in water because there is a lord that governs it that governs eight glory be to god that's the same thing with you and myself when god called us there is a lord and that lord is in the new birth the lord to live a christ-like is in the new birth it does not come from a church creed or a church doctrine praise the lord all if you just love the law with all your heart all your mind all your strength what are you doing when you're doing that you are letting go so the law of redemption will work through you the law of liberty will set you free praise the lord but you see when people get to the place where uh uh uh it says oh the church says this oh i had to do this or as the pastor would not be happy and all of that you you are stopping the law from working through you [Music] you are trying to govern yourself by a church creed in a message this is the way we do it you you are trying to govern yourself and when you're trying to govern yourself then god step back then that law cannot work praise the lord you see from the day that god said let there be light and the bible said he put the the sun in the heavens to give light to the dead in the moon and the star god never came back again and stands and and says well let me work on them you know i i have to i have to maintain them i have to you know know everything that would make that son to do what god wanted to do he place it in the sun before he put it out there that's the reason why the prophet of god can say all you need from your journey on earth to glory god has already placed it in you all my little redeemed needs to be a mother is already in her even though she's a little girl but everything she needs she don't get to a certain age and we go and shopping for her and say well we got to get her an other arm now you know she's growing we got to change her arm and you know and it's within her there's a law inside as she gets to setting edge the law rolls around the changes comes oh i see why brother branham say if i will ever get to my text because you can't get to your text on a subject like this you can get to your text on a soldier like this there's a lord in everything in everything if things are not working it's because the law and not emotion amen because the lord and not emotion if the laws are emotion they will work things will work everything anything there is a lord praise the lord oh glory to god tonight thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah we'll come back to that quote let's go to uh three council believer he says now i was thinking as i look out out the window a little a little while ago and look at the setting of the sun and seeing how all nature has a law praise the lord amen i mean uh it just it just i mean we we we get so we get so used to seeing it that sometimes i mean we don't we don't pay attention just just few weeks ago all of these trees were without leaves and everything was dry yes sir praise the lord and everything was dry but here the leaves begin to come up the flowers beginning to grow and every word is beginning to look green because there is a law the almighty god himself i was just looking through the windows and and and looking at uh uh you know a little flower bush at the back of the house there and to realize how how dry it was and i was shaving this morning as i looked through the way i said wow it's growing pretty there's a lord that kept the life of that little tree down in the earth until the winter was over man if you if you if you just think about it you think about design and wherever you see design there is an intelligence wherever you see design there is an intelligence that is behind it the design just don't suffice like that no it's not a random thing the setting of the sun and seeing how the nature has a lawn and when the winter comes the lord automatically all nature runs toward the sun down into the around the sub down into the tree roots is is buried as job said oh that thou will have me in the grave that i will keep me in a secret place until they arrive be and now that is if thou will hide me the nature the tree the life goes down in the root brother wayne he says and they're still until the warm past and and then call me and and and and and set me in a time nature has a law there is a lot of nature there is a law at all to he says he says there is no way okay that's i love this he says there's a law nature has a law there is a law to nature and there is no way at all to get around it you can't cheat nature you cannot cheat nature the lord you cannot cheat nature one of the biggest question that is that always people always ask you know and the thing about danger the thing about the heart the thing about all of the things that is happening and they ask why why why there is evil why there is evil why evil things happen now evil things comes under the law of contracts praise the lord it comes honor the lord of contracts and the lord of contracts is you cannot appreciate the good until you have the bond amen until there is there is uh a night you will realize appreciate the day praise the lord until you experience horrible darkness you will really never appreciate light so that is the law of contracts and there are a lot of other things that are in a lot of contracts conflict it's in the lord of contracts why there is conflict it's for us to be able to appreciate when there is no conflict praise the lord you know how it is when when uh when you have an ill feeling against someone especially one time you're on good terms and you can talk you can laugh together and you start having just because the person did something that you know that you were not happy about or maybe you did some whatever way that brought that conflict there is an ill feeling that comes no matter if you are right or you are wrong for the fact that you are not talking you feel bad praise the lord you see so all of the things that is happening these are the laws that god set now people are saying you know if there's a god why why they are what i mean why why are all of these things happening it's because god set those law in nature right he set those laws in nature that when a man is doing evil this is what would befall him you will reap what you saw it's a lot of nature you cannot get around it you cannot get around the lord of nature praise the lord amen you are born you're going to grow you're going to go through that cycle i mean they can fight you know do everything and say sir no you know i'm this uh this old age i'm going to stop it i'm going to take this medication i'm going to do this you can't get there is no way you can bypass nature you can cheat it just allow it to have its way and that's the way you will enjoy it that's the way you will enjoy it praise the lord people that don't like opposition is because you have not understood the lord of contracts if you don't like opposition you have not understood a lot of contracts there is a law it's there but when you understand when you understand when you understand the lord that god placed it and you and you have you have opposition that's the reason why people that understand a lot of contracts they use opposition to strengthen themselves they take all of the negative energy that comes from people and they look at themselves and say well if they are saying this about me then i'd rather do better sure instead of flying out why why are you saying this about me praise the lord glory be to god you know those things happen around family those things happen around church praise the lord a person leave church and pretty soon they they i mean people that were nice to one another now it becomes enemy to one another go into the same heaven but they can't talk on earth praise the lord go into the same heaven but they can't talk on earth it's because they have not appreciated the law of contracts but people that have appreciated a lot of contracts all they know how to step behind that line they know how to step behind that line and whether the person goes to the same church or not i mean they they i love you brother amen because if i can love you here on earth what am i going to do how am i going to make it it's a law all of the things that are happening and looks like the chaos and in sickness coronavirus some people say i lost my faith in god because coronavirus came over you don't understand that it is because man seen it is because the the evil they have played in god's laboratory they are doing all sorts of things to the universe they bring the evil upon them upon themselves it's not god that is doing it it's a law that is said that when you when you move this thing a flood of water will enter so if you go and move in the water until you say oh god why the water enter no why did you move it why did you move it it's just a law praise the lord amen they gave them the lord and says don't smoke in your house you go smoke in the house and put a secret down and fall and sleep in the house caught on fire he said god want my house burned no why did you smoke so it's a lot of contrast you don't expect to have a good result when you are doing bad things praise the lord people are looking for a god just like an errand boy that can run to their car okay come and do this okay go on come and do this holy lord come and do this no before he brought you and myself here he put law in nature that you will reap what you saw the law of reproduction the law of redemption the lord of contracts he put all of those laws to govern the universe [Laughter] automatic god we serve [Laughter] oh praise the lord glory be to god praise the lord god is not a magician people he's a god of principle he's the creator of the heaven and earth oh my goodness oh man praise the lord oh man my goodness isaiah says something i was looking at isaiah chapter 33 verse 22 the prophet isaiah says for the lord is our george the lord is our lord giver the lord is our king he will save us praise the lord amen that's what jesus said i've not come to destroy the lord amen those things that are placed in the law have come because they were major that's coming down and more and more to the lord of redemption the lord of redemption or the old testament hold a shadow of the blood of bulls and god what adam lost who have never come back to the human soul so jesus has to come so the lord of internal life can roll back when he paid the price on cavalry and said it is finished once again the soul of man can be able to experience what adam had what adam had we can be able to experience it by a down payment a down payment is just a little bit [Laughter] a little of the whole that's right bro there's a lord to everything praise the lord we'll talk more about it but you want to enjoy this subject read the message the restoration of the bride tree you enjoy it praise the lord because you know that's what brother branham said he says the devil he's just a bluff amen he's he's just a bluff he cannot stop god's law what god has put in place to work for his children the devil cannot stop it he cannot stop the law of god what he does is that he stop the people of god from allowing that lord to work through them because when he keeps pointing you to your arrow and you cannot look at your sacrifice there is no way the law of cleansing redemption and healing will that's work that's right because the word that the law of healing is look and leave yes look at life now all you have to do look at your sacrifice accept what god has done for you is now what you can do it's not how loyal you become to a church or how loyal you become to to any organization is looking and believing what god has done for you but the devil will not allow us to do that he will keep pointing us to error in our lives you see what they have done you see what they say you see what you are doing so all of those things stop the law of god from working in a believer because we want to make it happen no no he has already made it happen with him is a finnish work he has already made it happen oh just forgive me i'm not your traditional message preacher just forgive me glory be to god amen oh i believe that god sent us a prophet amen and i believe that that prophet brought us such a word such a word yes such a word he brought us such a word verbally will explain that the discernment all of the things he was doing is is just by obeying the law of god sure getting out of the way and let christ come that all he was doing he was just obeying the law of faith that's all but we become so technical in our mind we become so complicated this has to be this way and you got to bring it back this way no you gotta you're and when we finish explaining it then we confused what did i just said sure no you got to say it this way he said in 1963. oh no no 1962. he said um i mean you are not hot you're not you're not really blasting your sinks you're not blasting let's let's blast it let it leave let's blast it show me how to blast it you just gotta align the word and drive the people faith into it and let them fall in love with god and let them fall in love with god hallelujah oh my oh praise the lord thank you jesus i just love you father oh man praise the lord i'm just i'm just getting over just touching some highlights here we will we will look at this a little more on sunday by the grace of god they have a pressing water from the rock listen to what he says he says there is some law there is a law of nature some intelligence set this law in order not only that but that same intelligence has to operate the intelligence that said it in order is behind it to make sure now one jot all one tether that's right we break from god's word the intelligence that says you be your brian that you are a bride god has already set emotion that's why brother branham says walk in the light walk in the light just keep loving the lord keep loving him keep praising him keep doing what is right you will see your sinful nature just for them is it will just fall down things you are struggling with we just go yeah another young rich ruler came to jesus he says how can i have eternal life good master praise the lord jesus said sell all you have and give to the poor praise the lord amen now you realize that in the conversation jesus identified something of the gr of the young rich ruler he had a problem an inner problem and his inner problem was he had a great possession the possession was not outward possession it was inward possession praise the lord amen he had an inward possession that that was that that was stopping him or in one sense that he was kind of a struggling wave to be able to trust god because he has put all his confidence in his wealth as a young man he has worked so hard he has saved money and he have done all that i mean he have built this company and he built that and all his mind was in that right praise the lord amen so it was more it was more a spiritual possession he had than the physical possession because jesus told his disciple because you have left everything that 104 will be given to you in in this world in the world to come so jesus never preached a a a a a poverty message to strip his people from everything but he said seek ye first the kingdom of god when you get the kingdom of god within you then every other thing will be added are we together but if you don't have the kingdom within you you can you you cannot even have it without you can have a kingdom without if you don't have a kingdom within you have to first have a kingdom with him there's a lord that governs everything there's a law that governs everything and there is an intelligence behind that lord praise the lord are we together there's a lot in nature and there is no way you no way at all to get around it you cannot escape it we can we can take each of those laws the law of reproduction the lord of sowing and reaping talk a little bit about the lord of contracts if you just understand that if you just if you just understand that that that was the intelligence behind the book of job praise the lord because you have to get the good see the bad for you to appreciate the good god bless you like that praise the lord amen amen can you just think about it almighty god he built and eaten where his son was in his expression and adam could speak just like god and everything he you know he was god governing everything and then suddenly it looks like everything just went crazy praise the lord adam was not home one bed and and and when he looks he realized that the animals are fussing down there and and uh uh you know and this animal is running from this place i mean there was just there was just chaos in the garden of eden chaos he lost control he could not even call the animals by he could not even speak peace and everything just running upside down he's like oh my goodness what is going on let me get home to see eve when he got home he could tell from her face that something went wrong he could tell from her face that something went wrong she broke a law everything was governed everything was in place everything was peaceful but when she broke it lord everything just cattle now they cannot get in control of it anymore praise the lord you see that's that's the reason why paul speaks about that in the book of romans church that's a higher power adam never took no time to argue with eve because you have to realize he was in he was stay in the state of innocence he had never fussed before he he did not have the ability to fuss with eve and says what have you done see what you have done look look at everything he had not dropped down yet so he never fussed with eve he was just looking right and looking left he knew something has happened and he had to do something if he don't do it he's going to lost everything he didn't argue with eve okay come come tell me what you did you really gotta tell me tell me in details there was no time for that while we were yet sinners christ jesus took our place he stepped right in there after he took her place and redeemed her before he gained consciousness of what he had done after he took her place and redeemed her my goodness that's the reason why the scripture give the outstanding man love your wife just like christ what a place glory be to god glory be to god it's almost 9 30 a.m i have to stop musicians you can come think about the church a lord was broken now you think about it this way if it was just only for the fact that eve broke a commandment if he was only at the place where she did something that displeased god god alone was going to be angry with her but what she did it took a whole from the creation something in the law that was governing peace was taken out you see that's the reason why when young people in a family structure i'm going to do whatever i want to do i know i don't care what anybody says you are so consumed with yourself you are so consumed with yourself [Music] in a family life [Music] but that one action that one action is going to move many things from a part [Music] praise the lord you think about a family that don't have a lot of money they are not rich like the people in this world but they just love god and they learn to love one another and they learn to respect one another and support one another [Music] that home become the happiest place on earth it become the most peaceful place on earth [Music] they cannot wait to get home because they have set a law of god in their home to love one another to support one another and that law has created an atmosphere in their home that they cannot wait to get home there is there is just this anxiousness to get home but that very same home if the law that god has given to governor home is not in their home or you can put thousands of dollars there they're going to kill one another they will spill their own their own blood and they will leave the money and die [Music] there is a law to everything there's a law to happiness there's a law to happiness every lord is within you you don't look for happiness from outside happiness comes from within [Music] oh may god help us tonight let's just sing that song with the musicians oh love of god a strong [Music] yes love of god as strong [Applause] forever you jesus jesus said you must love the lord with all of your heart and all of your soul that should be the that should be the believer daily desire that should be his
