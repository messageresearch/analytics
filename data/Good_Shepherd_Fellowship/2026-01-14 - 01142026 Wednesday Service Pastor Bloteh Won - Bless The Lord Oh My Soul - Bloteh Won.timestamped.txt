[43:44] Lord covers me.
[43:51] Amen.
[43:53] Praise the Lord.
[43:55] Let's go back to Psalm chapter 103.
[43:59] We read from there last uh Wednesday
[44:02] night. We want to go back to that
[44:06] part that we
[44:08] dwell on.
[44:12] Psalm 13.
[44:30] Praise the Lord. Psalm
[44:35] 103
[44:38] want to read from verse one.
[44:41] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[44:45] is within me. Bless his holy name.
[44:49] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[44:51] that all his benefits.
[44:54] Who forgaveth all thine iniquities, who
[44:56] health all thy diseases,
[44:59] who redeemth
[45:01] the life from destruction,
[45:04] who crown thee with loving kindness in t
[45:07] of mercy, who satisfy the mouth with
[45:10] good things, so that their youth is
[45:13] renewed like the eagle. The Lord
[45:17] executed righteousness and judgment for
[45:20] all that are oppressed.
[45:23] He make known his ways unto Moses,
[45:27] his acts unto the children of Israel.
[45:31] The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow
[45:34] to anger and plenturious in mercy. Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading
[45:43] of his word. You may have your seat.
[45:46] Amen.
[45:48] You may have your seat.
[45:53] I want to start off tonight uh by just
[45:56] uh reading a quote from uh straight is
[46:00] the gate. It's a kind of a prayer but uh
[46:05] um I love the last line there. So we we
[46:09] just want to uh start up tonight by
[46:12] reading this. We pray Lord that there
[46:15] that there will not be a person leave
[46:17] here but what will be filled with your
[46:20] spirit.
[46:22] Maybe there won't be one emotion from
[46:25] the outside when it happen but Lord go
[46:29] on the inside. Pull off the shared and
[46:32] show us what we are. Lord grant it and
[46:36] then fill us with your spirit with our
[46:40] heart with our heart that's true and
[46:44] pure.
[46:46] And in this time of persecution and hard
[46:49] trials
[46:51] you will grow sweeter
[46:54] and dearer to us as we walk alone
[46:57] waiting for that day.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Waiting for that day. Tonight
[47:05] I I read his quote uh because I I was
[47:09] almost driven to speak on uh the
[47:13] reaction of the church on the pressure
[47:16] or on trials or on the persecution. But
[47:19] I thought I should come back to where we
[47:22] stopped on Wednesday night last week and
[47:24] just start from there. But uh uh just in
[47:29] line with uh with this thought year,
[47:32] brother Ram says, "And in this time of
[47:34] tri and uh and uh persecution and hard
[47:37] triumph, we will grow sweeter and dear
[47:40] and you will grow sweeter and dearer to
[47:43] us as we walk alone waiting for that
[47:45] day." Now so uh uh uh you see when when
[47:51] uh most of the time when we when we talk
[47:53] about the church being on the
[47:55] persecution
[47:57] uh many times is uh you know it's is so
[48:00] easy for it to be related to us uh you
[48:03] know taking away our religious right we
[48:06] you know we I mean maybe not coming to
[48:08] church or one thing or the other but you
[48:11] know whenever we have uh we have uh uh
[48:15] national disturbances or we have uh uh
[48:19] pestilence like the time of co and and
[48:22] all of that when when this when these
[48:24] kind of a things take place in the
[48:26] nation you know it also bring the church
[48:29] on a trial praise the lord uh in in a
[48:33] sense there is uh we we are humans you
[48:36] know we we are you know we are living in
[48:39] the society we have to work and uh we we
[48:42] have to go to school we have to take
[48:43] care of our families and different
[48:45] things that we do. So when when we have
[48:48] you know a kind of a national thing
[48:51] going on or a statewide thing going on I
[48:54] mean just like uh we had you know the
[48:57] George Floyd thing and different thing
[48:59] is it's uh it's is in one sense it
[49:02] brings us to a place of trial because uh
[49:07] uh it's it's easy for us to get under uh
[49:11] a little sense of uh fear and and and
[49:14] panic which of course as human you know
[49:16] that's that's something that is normal
[49:18] but uh uh the the the the side of it
[49:22] that I want for us to look at is that
[49:24] the we must remember that whenever uh
[49:28] you know uh uh the the church or the the
[49:31] nation comes on a uh crisis like this is
[49:35] is also an opportunity for the church
[49:38] for the people of God to experience
[49:41] God's supernatural
[49:43] praise the Lord
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because we must realize that
[49:47] we have a promise that he said he would
[49:49] never leave us and he would never
[49:51] forsake us.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; We have a promise that he said he will
[49:57] watch over our going out and our coming
[49:59] in. Now, now I mean we we we realize
[50:03] that we must take all of these things
[50:05] with wisdom and know how we go about
[50:08] doing whatever we going about to do. But
[50:11] the the portion of this that I want to
[50:13] get to is that we feed our mind with so
[50:16] much things from the media that it
[50:20] affect us and pretty soon we start
[50:23] panicking. Praise the Lord.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I mean uh when when actually
[50:29] in some sense we don't have no reason to
[50:31] panic because uh I mean we are not
[50:34] running into the street. We are not
[50:35] going about doing things that we not
[50:37] supposed to do. And uh uh actually we
[50:40] supposed to be on uh on uh uh on the
[50:44] front line. We supposed to be on the
[50:46] ground of prayers, you know, and just
[50:48] and just praying for people that are out
[50:51] there, praying for our loved ones,
[50:53] praying for our children and praying for
[50:55] one another. But uh uh I mean now with
[50:58] uh with uh uh uh our our our cell
[51:02] phones, we have we have all of these uh
[51:05] news feed that is coming in. I mean we
[51:07] can get them in the second, we can get
[51:09] them in the meaning, we can even get
[51:11] them life as they are going live
[51:14] &gt;&gt; and uh and pretty soon we spend much of
[51:17] the time doing they feeding our mind
[51:20] with what is happening out there and and
[51:22] and uh and our body gets under the
[51:25] condition because our our spirit has
[51:28] been so much filled with those things.
[51:31] Now it start affecting us that uh we
[51:33] have some sense of panic and fear. But
[51:37] on the other side of it is that we must
[51:39] realize that uh uh uh similar thing like
[51:43] this took place in Egypt just at a time
[51:46] when uh uh uh Moses was born.
[51:50] Praise the Lord.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. that the parents uh by prayer and
[51:55] believing in God, they were able to put
[51:57] their little baby into uh a little
[52:00] basket and throw him on the alligator
[52:02] river and they saw the supernatural of
[52:04] God.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, so if uh if if if we as
[52:11] uh as uh as as children of God and as
[52:13] people of God can just be able to take
[52:17] the right kind of a attitude in in in
[52:21] time like this. Uh it's is in time like
[52:24] this where God would like to send a
[52:26] message and says uh well uh uh sister
[52:29] you call uh uh brother war and tell him
[52:32] he must not go to this place or brother
[52:34] uh brother this you call this brother
[52:36] and tell those are things that the holy
[52:39] ghost can stay do. Amen.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:43] But I mean when when we are just all
[52:47] filling our minds, I mean we have all
[52:49] become news reporters, you know, and and
[52:52] and and and that's what we are spending
[52:54] our time doing. Then no wonder we would
[52:58] definitely be on a panic and fear.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; We will definitely be on a panic and
[53:06] fear. It have a beginning, it will have
[53:08] an end. Praise the Lord. And as long as
[53:10] we live on this earth, we might go into
[53:12] worse things.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; You know, we might go into worse things.
[53:16] Some of us that live in war to countries
[53:19] uh uh I mean when bullets were shooting
[53:22] and rockets were flying, we were still
[53:23] going to church.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; It is just it just uh you know uh
[53:30] knowing that God in his mercy, you know,
[53:34] uh uh uh uh he he has a provision for
[53:37] his people.
[53:41] Are we together?
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I just thought that
[53:46] uh we we start off like this. I I I
[53:49] thought I would talk a whole lot on
[53:51] that, but uh uh we'll keep that for
[53:55] another time. Praise the Lord.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to see, you know, uh uh uh
[54:01] the Lord dealing with us, moving in our
[54:03] midst. I mean it's uh it all happens
[54:06] when we prepare ourselves because God is
[54:08] moving all the time.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; You know, God is speaking all the time.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; You know, he's he's uh he's he's dealing
[54:14] with his people. Praise the Lord. I
[54:16] mean, Sister K sent her her praise
[54:18] report on Sunday. You know, she was
[54:20] panicking with her uh you know, losing
[54:23] her insurance and her primary medication
[54:26] going up to $800. And and uh I mean uh
[54:30] uh I heard about it, never spoke to her
[54:33] directly. I think I've heard my wife was
[54:35] talking about it and and uh and I was I
[54:38] was also in that same mindset because I
[54:41] was thinking about the many people that
[54:43] had to deal with uh you know uh uh
[54:46] changes of medication, losing their
[54:48] insurance and all of that. and uh and
[54:50] you know we took a we took a prayer that
[54:52] that was where I based my thought of
[54:54] this uh Psalm chapter 103 last week and
[54:57] I think it was on Friday or just before
[54:59] the weekend she you know she called and
[55:02] and uh uh you know and she experienced
[55:05] that having a discount or something that
[55:07] will have cost her 800 plus dollars she
[55:10] had to payundred I don't know 150 or how
[55:14] much it is so I mean uh the Lord know
[55:16] our needs praise the Lord
[55:19] &gt;&gt; he knows our needs. Uh uh he knows that
[55:22] uh uh I mean this is not something that
[55:25] uh uh uh we we have brought upon
[55:28] ourself. Let uh you know let the people
[55:31] that are sound today take care of that.
[55:33] Let's take care of our own business.
[55:35] Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Let's take care of our own business. We
[55:38] know that uh we have been commissioned
[55:40] by the word to stay in prayer. Pray for
[55:42] one another you know uh encourage one
[55:45] another. Let's build our faith in time
[55:47] like this. Praise the Lord.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; So last week we were talking looking
[55:52] right down here in uh in verse seven.
[55:56] That's where we were kind of basing our
[55:58] thought here in verse 7. He made known
[56:00] his ways unto Moses and his eyes unto
[56:04] the children of Israel. and uh and and
[56:07] and uh this this is a subject this is a
[56:10] psalm that uh that is that is that is
[56:13] greatly used for on on the basis of of
[56:17] healing you know uh the Lord that health
[56:20] us of all our diseases and he he
[56:23] forgiveth all our iniquities praise the
[56:27] lord amen he redeemed our life from
[56:30] destruction he crowned us with his
[56:33] loving kindness and his tend of mercy
[56:36] But uh uh we were looking a little bit
[56:39] into uh how
[56:42] uh you know as as the people of God we
[56:46] we we we gravitate to the acts of the
[56:49] Lord. You know we we want God to do
[56:52] things. We want God we want to see the
[56:55] manifestation of God. We we want to
[56:57] bring as we bring our prayer needs uh uh
[57:00] uh we we we we listening for testimony
[57:03] and and uh uh uh you know our sister on
[57:07] hospice you know that the doctor has has
[57:10] given her 10 days to live. We believe
[57:12] that God can can can spare her many more
[57:15] days just like he did to Hezekiah. You
[57:18] see and and as a people of God we we we
[57:22] you know we look to the acts of God. We
[57:25] want to see God in action. But we must
[57:28] also understand here like the scripture
[57:30] says, he make known his ways unto Moses.
[57:35] Praise the Lord.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; And in God's ways, we realize that's
[57:40] where his thoughts, his purpose,
[57:43] because behind every act and everything
[57:46] that the Lord allowed, the Bible says
[57:48] there will not be a war in the city if
[57:52] the Lord do not allow it.
[57:55] And that's what the scripture says.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Now, so if the Lord allow it, then we
[58:00] realize that
[58:02] &gt;&gt; he has a purpose
[58:04] &gt;&gt; like he said in Jeremiah, I know the
[58:06] thoughts that I think towards you.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; They are not the thoughts of evil. So
[58:11] God has a purpose and and that is what
[58:15] uh uh we want to realize here that uh uh
[58:19] uh and and and these are some of the
[58:21] things that we see here that as we look
[58:23] in the scripture here the Bible is
[58:25] making us to re to to see that just like
[58:28] with the children of Israel they saw the
[58:31] ways of God they saw the plagues falling
[58:34] in Egypt.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; They saw the water turn into blood. They
[58:39] saw the the the frogs, the fleas and
[58:41] everything that were happening in Egypt.
[58:43] They saw in Gush and there was like
[58:45] that. That was the act of God.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; But we have to realize that uh before
[58:52] any of those judgment fell down, God
[58:55] spoke to Moses.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And he would tell Moses, "Go back to to
[59:01] to Pharaoh because he's not listening. I
[59:04] have hide in his heart
[59:06] &gt;&gt; that he's not going to let you go. You
[59:09] go back to Pharaoh. I'm going to make
[59:11] him to see my judgment. Now, the
[59:14] children of Israel, they were not they
[59:16] were not in that conversation. They were
[59:18] not seeing what God was revering to
[59:20] Moses. The reason why God kept bringing
[59:23] the plague, they were not seeing it. All
[59:25] they were hearing in the news is that,
[59:27] "Oh yeah, you hear the water have turned
[59:29] into blood. Oh, you hear the palace is
[59:31] filled with frogs." Those are the things
[59:33] that they were hearing. They were they
[59:34] were hearing and they were seeing with
[59:36] their eyes.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; But God was making known his ways.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; To Moses.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; He was revealing to the prophet that his
[59:49] purpose.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; He was revealing to his prophet his
[59:56] purpose. So and and and and and uh uh uh
[1:00:00] coming coming under a prophetic ministry
[1:00:05] a it it makes us to be able to learn.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; It make us to learn the ways of God
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; that we we are not just uh h
[1:00:19] ordinary people or just just Christians
[1:00:23] that only rejoice in the acts of God.
[1:00:25] No,
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; we just want arts. We want arts. We want
[1:00:29] arts and not understanding. What is his
[1:00:32] purpose?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; What is his thought?
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Because if not, we will rejoice in his
[1:00:42] blessings.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; And then when he allow trials to to come
[1:00:47] our way where we should be able to build
[1:00:50] character,
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; we will lose it.
[1:00:54] We will misbehave
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; because our mindset will be as children
[1:00:59] of God, it must just be blessing and
[1:01:01] blessing God. I mean, God is not a
[1:01:03] grandfather that that spoil his
[1:01:05] children.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; He's a God of discipline.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; And now understanding and knowing those
[1:01:15] things, then it make us to be able to
[1:01:17] understand his ways.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. that he has a purpose behind
[1:01:24] everything that he's that he does and if
[1:01:27] he allows something in our life,
[1:01:31] he want us to understand his ways.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not that our prayers are
[1:01:39] falling to the ground or or his ears is
[1:01:42] too heavy to hear our prayers, but he
[1:01:45] want us to learn his ways.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:52] Are we together?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the reason why this this
[1:01:56] generation is a sign seeking generation,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, they it's a signseeking
[1:02:02] generation. They want signs. They want
[1:02:04] miracles until if they don't have it
[1:02:06] from God, they have to fake it
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; because that's the way they understand
[1:02:12] God.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Every service must be a miracle service.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Every service must be a healing service.
[1:02:19] So if they don't if they don't have it,
[1:02:21] if they don't have the genuine one, they
[1:02:23] will have to fake it.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; But I will tell you that if God don't
[1:02:29] does if he if he don't do one more
[1:02:32] miracle in your life,
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; he will still remain the same real
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; almighty God, the creator of heaven and
[1:02:38] earth.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because if God don't
[1:02:44] give you one miracle and he gave you an
[1:02:47] understanding why he don't give you that
[1:02:49] miracle, it's more beneficial to him.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And if he heals your body and you get
[1:02:57] sick again,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; come on, brother.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] He make known his ways to Moses
[1:03:12] in his acts
[1:03:14] to the children of Israel.
[1:03:20] So we read a few of these things and and
[1:03:22] uh uh last Wednesday also was a prayer
[1:03:25] meeting and we we taught how to keep you
[1:03:30] long. So we we weren't rushing over
[1:03:32] them. So I would just I would just run
[1:03:35] over them like we pressed last week
[1:03:38] looking to the unseen. Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; And we and we are thinking of a day that
[1:03:46] has gone where God moves in a manner
[1:03:50] to reveal himself to men.
[1:03:54] To make his ways known unto men through
[1:03:57] his servants, the prophets.
[1:04:00] He make known his ways unto men through
[1:04:04] his servants,
[1:04:06] the prophets.
[1:04:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; We also read this uh uh accepting God's
[1:04:16] provided way at the end time. I ask you
[1:04:20] as a believer,
[1:04:23] don't you move, sit still, and you
[1:04:26] believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:04:28] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:04:30] that I'm here to make known his work and
[1:04:34] his ways. I have been reluctant on these
[1:04:37] things
[1:04:40] the the 15 16 years I have been on the
[1:04:43] field but there is an hour coming now
[1:04:46] when something is fixing to take place.
[1:04:51] So brother expressing your uh reluctance
[1:04:55] to to be able to say certain things to
[1:04:57] the people make be able to make the
[1:04:59] people grab the people attention to
[1:05:01] certain things. He said but the hour is
[1:05:04] coming now you know that something is
[1:05:07] fixing to happen. So I'm you know I'm
[1:05:10] I'm trying to to make you understand
[1:05:14] make known unto you you know his works
[1:05:17] and his ways.
[1:05:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Make known unto you his works and his
[1:05:24] ways. You see, because when you
[1:05:27] understand God's ways, if you understand
[1:05:31] God's ways,
[1:05:34] you will know that
[1:05:40] when God is silent,
[1:05:43] that's the time where he's working.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You know uh uh uh like a
[1:05:53] brother said he says uh you know u when
[1:05:57] we when we talk about the silence we we
[1:05:59] we make it so mysterious because we tie
[1:06:02] a whole lot to revelation you know
[1:06:04] chapter chapter 8 you know we uh uh when
[1:06:08] the seven seals were open you know there
[1:06:10] was silence you know there was no one on
[1:06:12] the throne you know the the mighty angel
[1:06:14] come down we we tie it to lot of those
[1:06:18] mysterious things that sometimes we
[1:06:21] really don't know what
[1:06:24] the silence of God is,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; You know, we really don't know what the
[1:06:30] silence of God is. Let me let me take
[1:06:32] this other one again. For him will I
[1:06:34] accept. And year when our heavenly
[1:06:37] father year at the platform will do
[1:06:40] something in the audience and he will
[1:06:42] confirm it or make known his ways or
[1:06:47] heal the people or something and then
[1:06:48] you see that that that's the truth and
[1:06:51] yeah people come and everything. Praise
[1:06:55] the Lord.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So when when I first look at this whole
[1:07:00] thing I was I was really looking at it
[1:07:02] in the in a in a you know on the subject
[1:07:06] of healing. I was looking at it on the
[1:07:09] subject of healing because I think that
[1:07:12] is where one of the greatest
[1:07:14] misunderstanding that is in the church.
[1:07:18] Praise the Lord. That is that is where
[1:07:20] one of the greatest misunderstanding
[1:07:22] that is in the church because when we
[1:07:24] when we deal with uh the subject of
[1:07:27] healing you know uh uh uh uh like we we
[1:07:30] share with you here uh the son of
[1:07:33] righteousness rising with healing in its
[1:07:35] wings the church operating under the
[1:07:39] full anointing even in healing you know
[1:07:43] so there is there's a time where you
[1:07:45] know the church experience divine
[1:07:48] healing
[1:07:49] That's uh that's under the ego's
[1:07:51] anointing. The the the the Holy Ghost
[1:07:54] comes down. The presence of God is
[1:07:57] there. The sickness disappear. Praise
[1:08:00] the Lord.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Someone lying on the court rise up
[1:08:03] again. We know that uh that's that that
[1:08:06] is a miracle. Praise the Lord. That's
[1:08:09] supernatural. And it is as much as
[1:08:12] supernatural when a person goes under
[1:08:16] the man's anointing which will be on a
[1:08:18] man's wisdom going to the doctor for the
[1:08:21] surgery that is also supernatural
[1:08:24] because the doctors can put the the the
[1:08:26] the tissues together but God will have
[1:08:29] to do the healing.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; So just as uh divine healing and miracle
[1:08:36] is supernatural when when a person goes
[1:08:39] for surgery and the doctor take whatever
[1:08:42] they have to take out of their body and
[1:08:44] God comes down and heal them heal the
[1:08:47] wounds for them to be able to live a
[1:08:50] good healthy life that is just as
[1:08:52] supernatural as as a as a sickness
[1:08:56] getting out of a person body
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; because the Church have not known the
[1:09:04] ways of God.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; We only stop healing to divine healing.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; We only think that it's a divine healing
[1:09:13] or it's a miracle when the sickness
[1:09:15] disappear.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:18] It as much as healing and and and divine
[1:09:21] to God when it's under the OX ANOINTING
[1:09:25] THAT GOD GIVE a man or give a woman
[1:09:28] faith TO BE THEIR BODY is in pain but
[1:09:32] yet instead there's a faith in their
[1:09:34] heart that make them to keep believing
[1:09:36] God and keep trusting God.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] because the people have not understand
[1:09:50] the ways of God.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And that's that's the thing that has
[1:09:56] made all the the copycats
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; and the charastic word and and and and
[1:10:02] and all the fake healing and and all the
[1:10:05] healing ministry that have popped up in
[1:10:07] our days
[1:10:10] is all measuring only one thing that is
[1:10:13] on their mind.
[1:10:15] It's miracle.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; It's miracle.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; They will never take uh they will never
[1:10:24] think and consider in their mind that it
[1:10:26] is only God that heal.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; And if God choose to heal through
[1:10:31] surgery, IT'S GOD THAT HEAL.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; To him is supernatural. If he choose to
[1:10:36] heal through music, to him is
[1:10:39] supernatural.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Because he make known his way to a
[1:10:46] prophet and a prophet has taught us.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:11:06] Then Jesus came
[1:11:10] close here and allowed you to go home.
[1:11:17] Jesus
[1:11:19] knew what the father will was. Oh and oh
[1:11:24] what a blessed privilege it is that we
[1:11:27] can know the father will.
[1:11:34] If we will seek God, God will make known
[1:11:38] his will.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I did rather know that I am in the will
[1:11:44] of God
[1:11:46] if I never spoke to another person.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Than to preach to 10,000 people every
[1:11:53] night and out of the word of God.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:59] I I rather know the word of God and
[1:12:03] believe that it
[1:12:06] that it was David that said I rather be
[1:12:09] a doat.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Or something at the at the at the house
[1:12:16] of my Lord than to dwell in the tents of
[1:12:19] wickedness.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now because the people
[1:12:24] don't know uh h uh the ways of God, his
[1:12:29] will is declared in his ways
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; because God is known by his
[1:12:34] characteristics.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So because uh uh uh uh they have
[1:12:41] now known the ways of God, we we we see
[1:12:45] the the the the amount of wickedness
[1:12:50] just like David said yet, I'd rather be
[1:12:52] in the word of God. I'd rather be a dome
[1:12:55] than to be in a tent of wickedness.
[1:13:00] And that's what uh a bunch of our our uh
[1:13:03] you know rel religious cycles have
[1:13:05] turned out to be a tense of wickedness.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; We lie to to the people. We deceive
[1:13:15] them. We give them false hope
[1:13:18] instead of instructing them
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; in the word of God.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; So it's it's it's to be able to see you
[1:13:33] know that uh uh uh uh and and and and
[1:13:37] and God in his heart he has uh he has he
[1:13:41] has different way different
[1:13:43] manifestation
[1:13:45] for my father Bible says the ways of the
[1:13:47] Lord are pass funny out.
[1:13:51] Amen.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; His ways are passed funny out. Actually
[1:13:56] there in the book of Exodus we learn
[1:13:58] that uh God in his ways
[1:14:02] he pass is done
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; before we even know that it's done
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Moses said I want to see you God. He
[1:14:11] said okay you stand on the rock
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; wait for me and and and uh and he's
[1:14:16] paying all of his attention. God has
[1:14:18] come and pass.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And Moses said his back was was like the
[1:14:29] back of a man.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; He would have saw the backpack which
[1:14:33] mean God has already passed.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; He has already done it.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You see, but uh h uh uh uh we we we get
[1:14:43] so so so so limited and so so much
[1:14:47] operating by our five senses, you know.
[1:14:50] We want to see it there. We want to feel
[1:14:52] it. and and uh h you know and and taste
[1:14:55] it or smell it before we know that it is
[1:14:57] God and God operate far beyond our five
[1:15:01] senses.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He operate far beyond our five
[1:15:07] senses.
[1:15:12] So that's that's what the word in every
[1:15:15] age you know he make known
[1:15:19] his ways unto men through his servants
[1:15:21] the prophets.
[1:15:24] Praise the Lord for the people. Can you
[1:15:27] imagine after after the people have gone
[1:15:30] many years, many years, you know, Moses,
[1:15:36] the last time they had a man coming from
[1:15:39] the presence of the Lord to tell them
[1:15:40] anything was Joshua.
[1:15:43] In the whole time of uh of uh of uh of
[1:15:47] the judges, there were only there were
[1:15:50] only minor prophets on the scene because
[1:15:51] there's a prophet that came and spoke to
[1:15:53] Gideon.
[1:15:55] And uh uh uh but since that time, the
[1:16:00] people never had a man that had an open
[1:16:02] vision, a man that the word of God was
[1:16:05] coming to real and clear until Samuel
[1:16:09] came on the scene.
[1:16:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; If you remember uh uh uh Samuel met Saul
[1:16:24] when actually he was on on the hunt of
[1:16:26] looking for his father.
[1:16:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; And they told him that you know you will
[1:16:35] meet the prophet and when you meet that
[1:16:37] prophet he will tell you exactly where
[1:16:39] the animal is.
[1:16:42] That was something that was very real in
[1:16:44] Israel at that time.
[1:16:47] They had just come from under the the
[1:16:49] the period of time where the Bible says
[1:16:52] every man ways was right in their own
[1:16:55] eyes.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. the people the they the the
[1:17:00] faction their own way of worship you
[1:17:03] know the the the build molten images and
[1:17:06] and and different thing you know they
[1:17:09] just faction God to their mind
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; yeah come on
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; and I and and and it's it's it's almost
[1:17:17] like that feeling of the same thing is
[1:17:19] happening around us people just faction
[1:17:22] God I call into their mind
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; amen they they make their own god God in
[1:17:28] in their own understanding
[1:17:32] that they cannot be able to uh embrace
[1:17:35] God's word, embrace his instruction to
[1:17:38] really be able to experience him in his
[1:17:41] ways.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; To experience him in his manifestation.
[1:17:45] So what happen is that we make a certain
[1:17:48] thing and WE TRY LET'S TRY it and see if
[1:17:50] if if we experience God. Come on now.
[1:17:53] And then we come up with another thing
[1:17:55] again and say let's let's try it and see
[1:17:57] if we experience God.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; We are fracturing our own image
[1:18:03] according to our imagination.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; But he make known his ways
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; to his servants the prophet.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:16] As we listen to to the to the voice of
[1:18:19] God and and and listen to how God uh h
[1:18:24] dealt with his servant in this age, we
[1:18:26] can realize we we we can learn God's
[1:18:29] ways.
[1:18:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; We can learn the ways of God,
[1:18:38] the way he would do things and the
[1:18:40] reason why he would do things.
[1:18:43] Like like I said on on uh on Sunday,
[1:18:46] brother B, they're talking about that
[1:18:48] young lady
[1:18:50] that has backslided and she went away
[1:18:53] from God and and and you know and and
[1:18:56] you know and and and uh uh you know she
[1:18:59] she got horribly sick and all of that.
[1:19:01] uh we know the story there from warning
[1:19:03] and judgment
[1:19:05] and the the family came and and asked
[1:19:07] for prayer and you know and and she was
[1:19:10] prayed for you know she got back to
[1:19:12] serving the Lord and uh and and and just
[1:19:15] in that time you know uh uh she went to
[1:19:20] be with the Lord and which of course
[1:19:22] even at that time it it kind of a touch
[1:19:24] brother Brandon I mean she was she was
[1:19:27] she was just at a good place now uh I
[1:19:29] mean why why did Lord take her life. He
[1:19:32] went praying and you know and and then
[1:19:34] God make known his ways unto her
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; unto him.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; He make known his ways unto him in so
[1:19:42] much at a place where the Lord kind of
[1:19:44] for sure show at the time that she was
[1:19:46] backslided from the Lord. Uh uh being a
[1:19:49] daughter of God, she was not ready to go
[1:19:51] home.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; So we understand his ways.
[1:20:04] Brother Benham understand that you say,
[1:20:06] "Oh God, have mercy upon me. Who am I a
[1:20:08] sinner to even question you?"
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; But is God making known his ways?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Because if we don't understand the ways
[1:20:19] of God, we will misjudge his hearts.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; There is no way we will understand his
[1:20:28] heart because we will rejoice in one and
[1:20:30] then get discouraged in the other.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; David said he satisfied our mouth with
[1:20:42] good things so that our youth is renewed
[1:20:47] like the eagle.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; So our our our youth is renewed as a
[1:20:56] eagle. So as we as we just uh uh uh
[1:21:00] think about this tonight uh that's
[1:21:03] that's that's what I want wanted to
[1:21:05] bring to us for us to be able to to
[1:21:08] capture that in our mind. God is
[1:21:12] identified by his characteristics.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is identified
[1:21:21] by his ways
[1:21:24] and his ways are pass finding out.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; But if we if we can trust him,
[1:21:38] if we can can can can can can fall in
[1:21:41] love with him. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:44] after after he have moved and and and he
[1:21:48] have dealt with us in certain ways,
[1:21:50] surely he going to bring us to an
[1:21:53] understanding.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's going to bring us
[1:21:56] to an understanding why he allow certain
[1:22:00] things to happen, why he deal with us in
[1:22:02] certain ways.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh and and that's
[1:22:14] that's what we that's what we need
[1:22:16] because uh the truth about the matter
[1:22:19] that is that uh
[1:22:30] when we going through uh you know uh uh
[1:22:33] uh uh different face
[1:22:45] and many things that we are dealing
[1:22:47] with. Uh just like I said from the
[1:22:49] beginning, many of us cannot handle
[1:22:55] God
[1:22:57] silence.
[1:23:00] We can't handle it.
[1:23:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:04] Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; And uh and and and also look at it when
[1:23:09] you even look at it in a sense of the
[1:23:11] church ages,
[1:23:14] the opening of the seals. And the Bible
[1:23:17] would talk there in Revelation chapter 7
[1:23:19] and says there was there was there was
[1:23:21] silence in heaven. Now that could not
[1:23:24] come that that that that manifestation
[1:23:27] that happening. It could not come when
[1:23:29] the church was just in its infancy.
[1:23:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Because what children cannot handle
[1:23:41] silence.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; No, children cannot handle silence. The
[1:23:46] way they are made h the energy that is
[1:23:49] within them,
[1:23:52] they can't handle silence.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; You tell them to sit there, they sit
[1:23:57] quiet in in a little bit they jump up
[1:23:59] and they are moving up and down.
[1:24:03] If you are quiet and come around and say
[1:24:04] sir papa are you okay?
[1:24:07] Why? Because they are comp they are
[1:24:10] trying to compare their energy with
[1:24:12] yours. They are moving around and you
[1:24:14] are not doing anything.
[1:24:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; So sometimes it takes some growing up
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; for people to understand what silence
[1:24:26] is.
[1:24:28] Yeah.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; And I will tell you, silence can be
[1:24:31] loud.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Silence can be loud.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Well, we'll leave that for another day.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; The time is fast.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; We We'll take a time uh uh settle some
[1:24:49] things on on on talking about silence,
[1:24:52] dealing with silence. So, uh, we'll find
[1:24:55] some time and talk about that tonight.
[1:24:58] We just wanted to use this time and, uh,
[1:25:01] uh, pick up these different needs. I
[1:25:03] wanted to also use this time to
[1:25:05] encourage you that it's not time for you
[1:25:07] to just soak your mind into panic.
[1:25:10] That's not what that's not that's not
[1:25:12] what God is expecting of us in this
[1:25:14] time.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You have to know that
[1:25:18] the church is is God's institute is
[1:25:20] God's community to be able to handle
[1:25:23] these kind of things. We supposed to be
[1:25:25] standing in a gap and you know and and
[1:25:27] holding to the horns of the altar and

[1:25:50] media.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And feeding ourself with fear.
