[0:34] that they might accuse him
[0:36] and he saith unto the man which had the
[0:38] withered hand stand forth
[0:40] and he saith unto them
[0:42] is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
[0:44] days or to do evil
[0:46] to save life or to kill
[0:49] but they held their peace
[0:51] and when he had looked round about on
[0:52] them with anger being grieved for the
[0:55] hardness of their hearts he saith unto
[0:57] the man stretch forth thine hand
[1:00] and he stretched it out
[1:02] and his hand was restored whole as the
[1:04] other
[1:06] and the pharisees went forth and
[1:07] straightway took counsel with the
[1:08] herodians against him how they might
[1:10] destroy him but jesus withdrew himself
[1:13] with his disciples to the sea and a
[1:15] great multitude from galilee followed
[1:17] him and from judea and from jerusalem
[1:20] and from idumea and from beyond jordan
[1:22] and they about tire and sidon a great
[1:25] multitude when they had heard what great
[1:27] things he did came unto him
[1:29] and he spake to his disciples that a
[1:31] small ship should wait on him because of
[1:33] the multitude lest they should throng
[1:34] him for he had healed many in so much
[1:37] that they pressed upon him for to touch
[1:38] him as many as had plagues and unclean
[1:41] spirits when they saw him fell down
[1:43] before him and cried saying thou art the
[1:45] son of god
[1:47] and he straightly charged them that they
[1:49] should not make him known
[1:51] and he goeth up into a mountain and
[1:53] calleth unto him whom he would and they
[1:56] came unto him
[1:57] and he ordained twelve that they should
[1:59] be with him and that he might send them
[2:00] forth to preach and to have power to
[2:02] heal sicknesses and to cast out devils
[2:05] and simon he surnamed peter and james
[2:08] the son of zebedee and john the brother
[2:10] of james and he surnamed them bowen
[2:13] urges which is the sons of thunder
[2:16] and andrew and philip and bartholomew
[2:18] and matthew and thomas
[2:21] and james the son of alphaeus
[2:23] and thirdeas
[2:24] and simon the canaanite
[2:26] and judas iscariot which also betrayed
[2:29] him
[2:30] and they went into a house and the
[2:32] multitude cometh together again so that
[2:34] they could not so much as eat bread
[2:36] and when his friends heard of it they
[2:38] went out to lay hold on him for they
[2:40] said he is beside himself
[2:43] and the scribes which came down from
[2:44] jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by
[2:47] the prince of the devils casteth he out
[2:49] devils
[2:51] and he called them unto him and said
[2:53] unto them in parables
[2:55] how can satan cast out satan
[2:58] and if a kingdom be divided against
[2:59] itself that kingdom cannot stand
[3:03] and if a house be divided against itself
[3:05] that house cannot stand
[3:07] and if satan rise up against himself and
[3:09] be divided he cannot stand but hath an
[3:11] end
[3:13] no man can enter into a strong man's
[3:15] house and spoil his goods except he will
[3:17] first bind the strong man and then he
[3:19] will spoil his house
[3:21] verily i say unto you all sins shall be
[3:23] forgiven unto the sons of men and
[3:25] blasphemies wherewithsoever they shall
[3:27] blaspheme but he that shall blaspheme
[3:29] against the holy ghost hath never
[3:31] forgiveness but is in danger of eternal
[3:33] damnation
[3:34] because they said
[3:36] he hath an unclean spirit
[3:39] there came then his brethren and his
[3:40] mother and standing without sent unto
[3:43] him calling him
[3:44] and the multitude sat about him and they
[3:46] said unto him behold thy mother and thy
[3:48] brethren without seek for thee
[3:51] and he answered them saying
[3:53] who is my mother or my brethren
[3:56] and he looked round about on them which
[3:58] sat about him and said behold my mother
[4:00] and my brethren
[4:02] for whosoever shall do the will of god
[4:04] the same as my brother and my sister and
[4:07] mother
[4:08] and he began again to teach by the
[4:10] seaside and there was gathered unto him
[4:12] a great multitude so that he entered
[4:14] into a ship and sat in the sea and the
[4:16] whole multitude was by the sea on the
[4:18] land
[4:19] and he taught them many things by
[4:21] parables
[4:22] and said unto them in his doctrine
[4:25] hearken
[4:26] behold there went out a sower to sow
[4:30] and it came to pass as he sowed some
[4:32] fell by the wayside and the fowls of the
[4:34] air came and devoured it up
[4:37] and some fell on stony ground but it had
[4:39] not much earth and immediately it sprang
[4:41] up because it had no depth of earth but
[4:44] when the sun was up it was scorched and
[4:46] because it had no root it withered away
[4:49] and some fell among thorns and the
[4:51] thorns grew up and choked it and it
[4:54] yielded no fruit and other fell on good
[4:57] ground and did yield fruit that sprang
[4:59] up and increased and brought forth some
[5:02] thirty and some sixty and some in
[5:04] hundred
[5:05] and he said unto them
[5:06] he that hath ears to hear let him hear
[5:10] and when he was alone they that were
[5:12] about him with the twelve asked of him
[5:13] the parable
[5:15] and he said unto them unto you it is
[5:17] given to know the mystery of the kingdom
[5:18] of god but unto them that are without
[5:20] all these things are done in parables
[5:22] that seeing they may see and not
[5:25] perceive
[5:26] and hearing
[5:27] they may hear and not understand
[5:30] lest at any time they should be
[5:31] converted and their sins should be
[5:33] forgiven them
[5:34] and he said unto them know ye not this
[5:37] parable
[5:38] and how then will ye know all parables
[5:41] the sower soweth the word
[5:44] and these are they by the wayside where
[5:46] the word is sown
[5:48] but when they have heard satan cometh
[5:50] immediately and taketh away the word
[5:52] that was sown in their hearts
[5:54] and these are they likewise which are
[5:56] sown on stony ground who when they have
[5:58] heard the word immediately receive it
[6:00] with gladness
[6:02] and have no root in themselves and so
[6:04] endure but for a time
[6:06] afterward when affliction or persecution
[6:08] ariseth for the word's sake immediately
[6:10] they are offended
[6:12] and these are they which are sown among
[6:14] thorns
[6:16] such as hear the word
[6:18] and the cares of this world and the
[6:20] deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of
[6:23] other things entering in choke the word
[6:25] and it becometh unfruitful
[6:28] and these are they which are sown on
[6:29] good ground
[6:31] such as hear the word and receive it and
[6:33] bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some
[6:36] sixty and some in hundred
[6:38] and he said unto them
[6:40] is a candle brought to be put under a
[6:42] bushel or under a bed and not to be set
[6:45] on a candlestick
[6:47] for there is nothing hid which shall not
[6:49] be manifested neither was anything kept
[6:51] secret but that it should come abroad
[6:54] if any man have ears to hear let him
[6:56] hear
[6:58] and he said unto them take heed what ye
[7:00] hear with what measure ye meat it shall
[7:04] be measured to you and unto you that
[7:06] here shall more be given
[7:08] for he that hath to him shall be given
[7:11] and he that hath not from him shall be
[7:12] taken even that which he hath
[7:15] and he said
[7:16] so is the kingdom of god
[7:18] as if a man should cast seed into the
[7:21] ground
[7:22] and should sleep and rise night and day
[7:25] and the seed should spring and grow up
[7:27] he knoweth not how
[7:29] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[7:31] herself
[7:32] first the blade then the ear
[7:34] after that the full corn in the ear
[7:38] but when the fruit is brought forth
[7:40] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[7:42] because the harvest is come
[7:45] and he said
[7:46] where unto shall we liken the kingdom of
[7:48] god or with what comparison shall we
[7:50] compare it
[7:52] it is like a grain of mustard seed which
[7:54] when it is sown in the earth is less
[7:56] than all the seeds that be in the earth
[7:58] but when it is sown it groweth up and
[8:00] becometh greater than all herbs and
[8:02] shooteth out great branches so that the
[8:05] fowls of the air may lodge under the
[8:06] shadow of it
[8:08] and with many such parables spake he the
[8:10] word unto them as they were able to hear
[8:12] it but without a parable spake he not
[8:14] unto them
[8:15] and when they were alone he expounded
[8:17] all things to his disciples
[8:19] and the same day when the even was come
[8:21] he saith unto them let us pass over onto
[8:23] the other side
[8:25] and when they had sent away the
[8:26] multitude they took him even as he was
[8:28] in the ship
[8:30] and there were also with him other
[8:31] little ships
[8:32] and there arose a great storm of wind
[8:35] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[8:37] it was now full
[8:39] and he was in the hinder part of the
[8:40] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[8:42] him and say unto him master carest thou
[8:44] not that we perish
[8:46] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[8:48] said unto the sea peace be still
[8:52] and the wind ceased and there was a
[8:54] great calm
[8:56] and he said unto them
[8:58] why are ye so fearful
[9:00] how is it that ye have no faith
[9:03] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[9:05] to another what manner of man is this
[9:09] that even the wind and the sea obey him
[9:17] and they came over onto the other side
[9:18] of the sea into the country of the
[9:20] gadarenes and when he was come out of
[9:23] the ship immediately there met him out
[9:24] of the tombs a man with an unclean
[9:26] spirit who had his dwelling among the
[9:28] tombs and no man could bind him no not
[9:31] with chains because that he had been
[9:33] often bound with fetters and chains and
[9:35] the chains had been plucked asunder by
[9:37] him and the fetters broken in pieces
[9:39] neither could any man tame him
[9:41] and always night and day he was in the
[9:44] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[9:46] cutting himself with stones
[9:48] but when he saw jesus so far off he ran
[9:50] and worshipped him and cried with a loud
[9:52] voice and said what have i to do with
[9:55] thee jesus thou son of the most high god
[9:57] i adjure thee by god that thou torment
[9:59] me not
[10:01] for he said unto him come out of the man
[10:03] thou unclean spirit
[10:05] and he asked him
[10:07] what is thy name
[10:08] and he answered saying my name is legion
[10:11] for we are many
[10:13] and he besought him much that he would
[10:15] not send them away out of the country
[10:18] now there was there nigh unto the
[10:20] mountains
[10:21] a great herd of swine feeding
[10:23] and all the devils besought him saying
[10:25] send us into the swine that we may enter
[10:27] into them
[10:29] and forthwith jesus gave them leave and
[10:32] the unclean spirits went out and entered
[10:34] into the swine and the herd ran
[10:36] violently down a steep place into the
[10:38] sea they were about two thousand
[10:41] and were choked in the sea
[10:43] and they that fed the swine fled and
[10:45] told it in the city and in the country
[10:47] and they went out to see what it was
[10:49] that was done and they come to jesus
[10:52] and see him that was possessed with the
[10:54] devil and had the legion
[10:56] sitting and clothed
[10:58] and in his right mind
[11:00] and they were afraid
[11:02] and they that saw it told them how it
[11:04] befell to him that was possessed with
[11:06] the devil and also concerning the swine
[11:09] and they began to pray him to depart out
[11:11] of their coasts
[11:13] and when he was come into the ship he
[11:14] that had been possessed with the devil
[11:16] prayed him that he might be with him
[11:18] howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith
[11:20] unto him go home to thy friends
[11:22] and tell them how great things the lord
[11:24] hath done for thee and hath had
[11:26] compassion on thee
[11:28] and he departed and began to publish in
[11:30] decapolis how great things jesus had
[11:33] done for him
[11:34] and all men did marvel
[11:36] and when jesus was passed over again by
[11:38] ship onto the other side much people
[11:40] gathered unto him and he was nigh unto
[11:42] the sea
[11:43] and behold there cometh one of the
[11:45] rulers of the synagogue jairus by name
[11:48] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[11:50] and besought him greatly saying my
[11:51] little daughter lieth at the point of
[11:53] death i pray thee come and lay thy hands
[11:55] on her that she may be healed and she
[11:57] shall live
[11:59] and jesus went with him and much people
[12:01] followed him and thronged him and a
[12:03] certain woman which had an issue of
[12:05] blood 12 years and had suffered many
[12:07] things of many physicians and had spent
[12:09] all that she had and was nothing
[12:11] bettered but rather grew worse when she
[12:13] had heard of jesus came in the press
[12:15] behind and touched his garment
[12:18] for she said if i may touch but his
[12:20] clothes i shall be whole and straightway
[12:23] the fountain of her blood was dried up
[12:26] and she felt in her body that she was
[12:28] healed of that plague
[12:30] and jesus immediately knowing in himself
[12:32] that virtue had gone out of him turned
[12:34] him about in the press and said who
[12:36] touched my clothes and his disciples
[12:38] said unto him thou seest the multitude
[12:41] thronging thee and sayest thou who
[12:43] touched me
[12:44] and he looked round about to see her
[12:46] that had done this thing but the woman
[12:48] fearing and trembling knowing what was
[12:50] done in her came and fell down before
[12:52] him and told him all the truth and he
[12:54] said unto her daughter
[12:57] thy faith
[12:58] hath made thee whole
[13:00] go in peace and be whole of thy plague
[13:03] while he yet spake there came from the
[13:05] ruler of the synagogue's house certain
[13:06] which said thy daughter is dead why
[13:09] trouble is thou the master any further
[13:11] as soon as jesus heard the word that was
[13:13] spoken he saith unto the ruler of the
[13:15] synagogue
[13:16] be not afraid
[13:18] only believe
[13:19] and he suffered no man to follow him
[13:21] save peter and james and john the
[13:24] brother of james and he cometh to the
[13:26] house of the ruler of the synagogue and
[13:28] seeth the tumult
[13:29] and them that wept and wailed greatly
[13:33] and when he was come in he saith unto
[13:34] them
[13:35] why make ye this ado and weep
[13:38] the damsel is not dead but sleepeth
[13:41] and they laughed him to scorn
[13:43] but when he had put them all out he
[13:45] taketh the father and the mother of the
[13:47] damsel and them that were with him
[13:50] and entereth in where the damsel was
[13:51] lying
[13:52] and he took the damsel by the hand and
[13:55] said unto her
[13:56] talitha kumai
[13:59] which is being interpreted damsel i say
[14:02] unto thee arise
[14:04] and straightway the damsel arose and
[14:07] walked
[14:08] for she was of the age of 12 years
[14:11] and they were astonished with a great
[14:12] astonishment
[14:14] and he charged them straightly that no
[14:16] man should know it and commanded that
[14:19] something should be given her to eat
[14:31] and were filled
[14:32] and they took up 12 baskets full of the
[14:35] fragments and of the fishes
[14:38] and he went out from vents and came into
[14:40] his own country and his disciples follow
[14:43] him and when the sabbath day was come he
[14:45] began to teach in the synagogue and many
[14:47] hearing him were astonished saying from
[14:49] whence hath this man these things and
[14:52] what wisdom is this which is given unto
[14:54] him that even such mighty works are
[14:56] wrought by his hands
[14:57] he's not this the carpenter the son of
[15:00] mary the brother of james and joseph and
[15:02] of judah and simon and are not his
[15:04] sisters here with us
[15:07] and they were offended at him but jesus
[15:09] said unto them
[15:10] a prophet is not without honor but in
[15:12] his own country and among his own kin
[15:15] and in his own house
[15:16] and he could there do no mighty work say
[15:19] that he laid his hands upon a few sick
[15:20] folk and healed them and he marveled
[15:23] because of their unbelief
[15:25] and he went round about the villagers
[15:26] teaching
[15:27] and he called unto him the twelve and
[15:29] began to send them forth by two and two
[15:32] and gave them power over unclean spirits
[15:34] and commanded them that they should take
[15:36] nothing for their journey save a staff
[15:38] only no script no bread no money in
[15:41] their purse but be shot with sandals and
[15:45] not put on two coats
[15:47] and he said unto them
[15:48] in what place so ever ye enter into a
[15:50] house there abide till you depart from
[15:53] that place
[15:54] and whosoever shall not receive you nor
[15:56] hear you when ye depart thence shake off
[15:58] the dust under your feet for a testimony
[16:00] against them
[16:01] verily i say unto you it shall be more
[16:03] tolerable for sodom and gomorrah in the
[16:05] day of judgment than for that city and
[16:08] they went out and preached that men
[16:10] should repent
[16:11] and they cast out many devils and
[16:13] anointed with oil many that were sick
[16:14] and healed them
[16:16] and king herod heard of him where his
[16:18] name was spread abroad and he said that
[16:20] john the baptist was risen from the dead
[16:23] and therefore mighty works to show forth
[16:25] themselves in him
[16:26] others said that it is elias
[16:29] and others said that it is a prophet or
[16:31] as one of the prophets but when herod
[16:33] heard thereof he said it is john whom i
[16:36] beheaded
[16:37] he has risen from the dead
[16:39] for herod himself had sent forth and
[16:41] laid hold upon john and bound him in
[16:43] prison for herodias sake his brother
[16:45] philip's wife for he had married her
[16:48] for john had said unto herod it is not
[16:49] lawful for thee to have thy brother's
[16:51] wife
[16:52] therefore herodias had a quarrel against
[16:54] him and would have killed him but she
[16:56] could not for herod feared john knowing
[16:58] that he was a just man and unholy and
[17:01] observed him
[17:02] and when he heard him he did many things
[17:04] and heard him gladly
[17:06] and when a convenient day was come that
[17:08] herod on his birthday made a supper to
[17:09] his lords high captains and chief
[17:11] estates of galilee and when the daughter
[17:13] of the said herodias came in and danced
[17:15] and pleased herod and them that sat with
[17:18] him the king said unto the damsel ask of
[17:20] me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give
[17:22] it thee and he swear unto her whatsoever
[17:24] thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee
[17:26] unto the half of my kingdom and she went
[17:28] forth and said unto her mother what
[17:30] shall i ask and she said the head of
[17:33] john the baptist
[17:35] and she came in straightway with haste
[17:36] unto the king and asked saying i will
[17:38] that thou give me by and by in a charger
[17:40] the head of john the baptist
[17:43] and the king was exceeding sorry
[17:45] yet for his oath's sake
[17:48] and for their sakes which sat with him
[17:50] he would not reject her
[17:52] and immediately the king sent an
[17:53] executioner and commanded his head to be
[17:55] brought and he went and beheaded him in
[17:58] the prison and brought his head in a
[17:59] charger and gave her to the damsel and
[18:02] the damsel gave it to her mother
[18:05] and when his disciples heard of it they
[18:07] came and took up his corpse and laid it
[18:09] in a tomb and the apostles gathered
[18:11] themselves together unto jesus and told
[18:13] him all things both what they had done
[18:16] and what they had taught and he said
[18:18] unto them
[18:19] come ye yourselves apart into a desert
[18:21] place and rest a while
[18:23] for there were many coming and going and
[18:24] they had no leisure so much as to eat
[18:27] and they departed into a desert place by
[18:29] ship privately
[18:31] and the people saw them departing and
[18:33] many knew him and ran a foot they're out
[18:35] of all cities and outwent them and came
[18:37] together unto him
[18:39] and jesus when he came out saw much
[18:40] people and was moved with compassion
[18:42] toward them because they were as sheep
[18:44] not having a shepherd
[18:46] and he began to teach them many things
[18:49] and when the day was now far spent his
[18:51] disciples came unto him and said this is
[18:53] a desert place and now the time is far
[18:55] past send them away that they may go
[18:58] into the country round about and into
[18:59] the villages and buy themselves bread
[19:01] for they have nothing to eat he answered
[19:03] and said unto them
[19:05] give ye them to eat
[19:06] and they say unto him shall we go and
[19:08] buy 200 penny worth of bread and give
[19:10] them to eat
[19:11] he saith unto them how many lobes have
[19:14] ye gone see
[19:16] and when they knew they say five and two
[19:19] fishes
[19:20] and he commanded them to make all sit
[19:22] down by companies upon the green grass
[19:24] and they sat down in ranks by hundreds
[19:26] and by fifties
[19:28] and when he had taken the five loaves
[19:30] and the two fishes he looked up to
[19:32] heaven and blessed and break the loaves
[19:35] and gave them to his disciples to set
[19:37] before them
[19:38] and the two fishes divided he among them
[19:40] all
[19:41] and they did all eat and were filled
[19:44] and they took up twelve baskets full of
[19:46] the fragments and of the fishes
[19:48] and they that did eat of the loaves were
[19:50] about five thousand men
[19:52] and straightway he constrained his
[19:54] disciples to get into the ship and to go
[19:55] to the other side before and to
[19:57] bethsaida while he sent away the people
[20:00] and when he had sent them away he
[20:01] departed into a mountain to pray
[20:04] and when even was come the ship was in
[20:05] the midst of the sea and he alone on the
[20:07] land and he saw them toiling and rowing
[20:10] for the wind was contrary unto them
[20:12] and about the fourth watch of the night
[20:14] he cometh unto them walking upon the sea
[20:16] and would have passed by them
[20:19] but when they saw him walking upon the
[20:21] sea
[20:21] they supposed it had been a spirit and
[20:23] cried out
[20:25] for they all saw him and were troubled
[20:27] and immediately he talked with them and
[20:30] saith unto them be a good cheer it is i
[20:32] be not afraid
[20:34] and he went up unto them into the ship
[20:36] and the wind ceased
[20:38] and they were sore amazed in themselves
[20:40] beyond measure and wondered for they
[20:42] considered not the miracle of the loaves
[20:44] for their heart was hardened
[20:46] and when they had passed over they came
[20:48] into the land of ganesha and drew to the
[20:50] shore and when they would come out of
[20:52] the ship straightway they knew him and
[20:54] ran through that whole region roundabout
[20:57] and began to carry about in beds those
[20:59] that were sick where they heard he was
[21:01] and whether so whether he entered into
[21:03] villages or cities or country they laid
[21:05] the sick in the streets and besought him
[21:07] that they might touch if it were but the
[21:08] border of his garment
[21:10] and as many as touched him were made
[21:12] whole
[21:14] [Music]
