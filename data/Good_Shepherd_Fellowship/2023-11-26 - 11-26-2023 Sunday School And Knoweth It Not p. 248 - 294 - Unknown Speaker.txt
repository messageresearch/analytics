foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're writing Christ because that's the only thing that's going to because we're in

man that can't make decisions I'm not a politician I don't neither democrat or republican they're all Filthy I'm for one Kingdom and that's the kingdom of Jesus Christ that's all but how in the world
