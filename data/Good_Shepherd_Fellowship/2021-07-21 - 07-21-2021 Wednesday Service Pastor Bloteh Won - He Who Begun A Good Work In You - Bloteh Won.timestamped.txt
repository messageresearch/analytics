[45:42] anniversary
[45:42] and i'm reading these words they're
[45:44] becoming very personal to me
[45:47] and in my relationship with
[45:50] with this assembly being confident
[45:53] of this very thing that he wish

[46:32] we just want to ask lord the blessings

[46:58] amen amen the lord bless you you may
[47:01] have your seed
[47:05] and uh i wish i was i was
[47:09] you know i was fully caught into the
[47:11] inspiration
[47:12] of doing something uh this weekend uh
[47:16] as a church anniversary because it would
[47:18] have just
[47:19] it would have just worked so well it
[47:22] would have just worked so well
[47:25] two wednesdays ago after the service
[47:28] uh uh
[47:34] i think i was on my way home or maybe
[47:36] the the next day
[47:38] uh uh one of the sister sister evie
[47:41] called me on the phone and you know and
[47:43] and we were commenting a little bit
[47:45] about the service and we were just
[47:46] fellowshipping and she says well brother
[47:48] juan do you
[47:48] you realize that uh uh
[47:53] today or the uh yesterday which was
[47:56] we were talking on thursday and it was
[47:57] yesterday she said you realize that it
[48:00] was
[48:00] it was the the 7th of july which means
[48:03] 7-7
[48:04] i say i thought about it but i did not
[48:06] want to make anything out of it
[48:08] because uh you know i'm i'm just i don't
[48:11] know it's just my nature
[48:13] i just don't like making things trying
[48:16] to create things
[48:18] you know but what what came to my mind
[48:20] actually that i have a good friend
[48:22] over in ghana and we did his wedding on
[48:24] the 7th of july
[48:25] uh uh some years back so most of the
[48:28] time i do think about him
[48:30] but then i thought about it that day i
[48:32] says oh yeah this is the seven of july
[48:34] this is
[48:35] this is july 7 21 you know so it's
[48:39] almost like a 7-7
[48:41] but then i realized that the following
[48:43] wednesday also turned out to be the 14th
[48:46] which was seven seven and seven
[48:50] seven seven and today it turned to be
[48:52] the 21
[48:54] 777
[48:58] so then i said to myself it looks like i
[49:00] can get out of this
[49:02] you know i'm trying not to say anything
[49:05] but it keeps provoking me
[49:07] so i i will have to say something about
[49:10] it
[49:11] but i would just show i would just hear
[49:14] something a little bit
[49:15] genesis chapter one
[49:19] genesis chapter one uh you know
[49:22] seven is a very uh
[49:28] unique numbers like like every other
[49:30] number
[49:31] in the bible and uh but
[49:34] you will you will realize these few days
[49:37] i've been going over some few things
[49:39] and if the lord help us we try to share
[49:41] it to you
[49:43] and the reason why i've been reviewing
[49:44] those things is because
[49:47] we are living in such an age and time
[49:49] where
[49:50] uh there are a lot of people that are
[49:52] trying to rise up and
[49:54] and and you know and and discourage us
[49:56] like i was trying to speak on sunday
[49:59] and never really got down to to where my
[50:01] inspiration was
[50:02] but talking about you know uh uh
[50:05] people you know christians in this age
[50:08] being uh bewitched
[50:10] you know uh we we are turning uh into
[50:13] formalities we are running
[50:15] after different things instead of
[50:17] running after the principal thing which
[50:19] is god himself
[50:21] and uh uh uh so
[50:25] you know um a couple of years ago
[50:28] uh uh the roman church came out with an
[50:31] article i might print their article open
[50:34] and and show it to you if i can get my
[50:36] hands on it before sunday
[50:38] and it came out with an article and that
[50:40] says that
[50:41] you cannot really trust the bible
[50:45] you cannot trust the bible because there
[50:48] are a lot of
[50:49] uh uh you know a lot of um
[50:55] inaccuracies as they think but
[50:59] so it caught my attention and i've been
[51:01] trying to look
[51:03] into uh some some few studies
[51:06] to to bring out
[51:09] uh you know and and try to show to you
[51:12] how
[51:13] this bible is the most accurate amen
[51:18] is most the most accurate
[51:24] literature you have ever have
[51:27] in the universe of man
[51:32] and if the lord helped me i would try to
[51:35] to bring it to you we if we can get to
[51:37] it on sunday
[51:39] i will i'll try to i will try to get to
[51:41] it and if
[51:42] you realize in uh in in
[51:46] in recent time i've been i've been
[51:49] making emphasis on that and been trying
[51:51] to encourage you
[51:52] most especially my young people and
[51:55] because
[51:56] you know uh you you will never be able
[51:58] to appreciate
[51:59] you know the message of the hour until
[52:02] you appreciate the bible
[52:04] you know you will never understand the
[52:06] message of the hour
[52:07] until you understand the bible you know
[52:11] until the grace of god help you you know
[52:14] sometimes it looks like
[52:15] you know people says you will not
[52:17] understand the bible don't tell you
[52:18] understand the message no
[52:20] it is i think it's the other way around
[52:23] you know you'll be able to appreciate
[52:25] the message
[52:26] that god has sent to us when you really
[52:29] get in the bible
[52:31] because just like i've said to you
[52:33] before
[52:34] uh god is with with the jews
[52:39] uh in inner party just like he showed to
[52:43] moses
[52:44] he said build a tabernacle according to
[52:46] the pattern
[52:48] that i show you in heaven
[52:51] now for us as gentiles he deals with us
[52:55] as types what has
[52:58] already happened he he show us it back
[53:02] and says what is happening now look back
[53:04] in the old testament
[53:06] you have a typed in that's right
[53:09] you know but it's because
[53:14] man has always tried you know
[53:17] to make to make the word of god
[53:20] fade into the understanding of fit into
[53:24] their theory
[53:25] and and because it's not fitting that is
[53:28] the reason why let me just show you
[53:30] some few things the very first
[53:36] sentence in the bible genesis chapter 1
[53:41] genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[53:44] praise the lord i tried to get
[53:49] a little uh hebrew
[53:52] version of faith uh
[53:56] genesis chapter one verse one
[54:00] if uh if uh the sisters can help us
[54:03] import
[54:04] that uh little hebrew phrase on a day
[54:07] which of course is
[54:08] genesis is is genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[54:12] in the hebrew in the beginning
[54:15] god created the heaven
[54:19] and the earth now
[54:22] in the in the in in the hebrew turks
[54:27] you realize that
[54:30] that just the first verse in the bible
[54:35] is uh seven words
[54:39] seven words i tried to to
[54:42] uh uh see if i could
[54:46] uh uh try to
[54:50] speak it in hebrew but no my tongue
[54:53] can't get there
[54:54] so i i won't try tonight because i don't
[54:58] want
[54:59] i don't want to blaspheme from the altar
[55:02] praise the lord
[55:05] and then if you if you look closely
[55:10] uh you'll realize that
[55:14] we read from the left to the right but
[55:16] in the hebrew degree from the right
[55:18] to the left
[55:21] is because all language meets
[55:26] at jerusalem
[55:30] all language meets at jerusalem
[55:35] those that read you'll realize that
[55:37] there's one group of people that read
[55:39] from the left
[55:40] to the right they are on one side of
[55:42] israel
[55:43] and then on the other side of israel all
[55:46] the nations from there read from
[55:48] the right to the left
[55:52] you can go and check it out you'll
[55:53] realize that
[55:56] now and then if you look at this you
[55:59] will realize that
[56:01] there are seven words in the first
[56:05] verse of the torah that would be
[56:08] what the that will be how it is in the
[56:10] torah
[56:12] and if you count the letters the hebrew
[56:15] letters
[56:16] this is 28 letters
[56:23] 28 letters with some of mine
[56:28] uh
[56:32] uh study that i was looking at as
[56:36] a look at this and and you you realize
[56:39] that so
[56:40] if you if you look closely
[56:43] you will see that uh
[56:47] the first three hebrew words translated
[56:50] that translate in the beginning god
[56:54] created has 14 letters
[57:04] the last four words heaven and earth
[57:09] also have 14 letters
[57:13] and i was looking at this as as i was
[57:16] studying it
[57:17] you you see a bunch of seven
[57:20] keep repeating right in the first
[57:24] chapter
[57:28] god created the heaven and the earth and
[57:31] all of his creation
[57:32] in six days and then on the seventh day
[57:36] he rested amen
[57:41] praise the lord so you see all of these
[57:45] you know just keep repeating it is so
[57:48] so so so amazing
[57:52] it is it is so amazing when you when you
[57:54] just
[57:55] look into it and and most of these
[57:57] things
[57:58] that that are that are coming out
[58:01] they are done by even uh
[58:05] they are they are scientists researchers
[58:09] that are trying to look into
[58:12] the accuracy of the bible
[58:16] and the more they look into it the more
[58:19] they realize
[58:21] that this was the design of god
[58:24] himself
[58:28] praise the lord it was god himself
[58:32] that designed it and and the and the
[58:35] amazing thing about it is that uh
[58:39] uh when you when you look at it close i
[58:42] mean
[58:42] there are just a lot of things i could
[58:43] it would take me all a lot of time to
[58:45] just to just show
[58:47] and what would make us or make us
[58:51] do not really appreciate this is because
[58:55] we have an english bible
[58:59] that came from a hebrew text
[59:07] praise the lord that's that will that's
[59:10] that's the thing that will
[59:12] that will uh uh you know it would trick
[59:15] us a little bit let me see that way sure
[59:19] but if you can look into the hebrew text
[59:22] as
[59:22] as we are saying this then you will
[59:25] start to appreciate it
[59:29] praise the lord
[59:38] i was going to i was going to show
[59:44] uh
[59:47] oh let me leave that let me leave that
[59:49] it might it would take me into something
[59:51] else let me just leave it
[59:53] but there's you know
[59:56] that is i mean it's it's just amazing
[1:00:00] it's it's amazing my i mean you know my
[1:00:02] mind is blown
[1:00:04] when i just think about the intelligence
[1:00:08] that is behind their
[1:00:12] intelligence
[1:00:16] praise the lord amen
[1:00:19] the bible says in genesis chapter 1
[1:00:23] verse 11 it says let every sea
[1:00:27] bring forth of its kind amen
[1:00:31] let every seed bring forth of its kind
[1:00:36] why you think that
[1:00:40] the the hearse or the dog or
[1:00:44] any animal reproduce itself
[1:00:47] now it's so easy to say that the word of
[1:00:51] god say
[1:00:51] every seed must bring forth of his kind
[1:00:56] praise the lord but you see there is an
[1:00:59] intelligence
[1:01:00] that is behind that word
[1:01:04] that has a dna
[1:01:08] called
[1:01:11] it has a design
[1:01:17] praise the lord and that was that was
[1:01:21] one of the place where
[1:01:23] signs raise their hands
[1:01:27] even though they they don't want to come
[1:01:29] to full
[1:01:30] surrounding to believe that there's a
[1:01:33] great intelligence behind the creation
[1:01:36] they still want to hold to all their
[1:01:38] turing but when it comes to the to the
[1:01:41] dna code
[1:01:44] it shows the intelligence
[1:01:47] that only one man can have
[1:01:51] one being and that's almighty god
[1:01:59] praise the lord
[1:02:04] and design that makes
[1:02:08] you in in a sense together
[1:02:12] if a man will have five children or how
[1:02:15] many children
[1:02:16] he will have uh uh the
[1:02:20] intelligence of god designed it in a way
[1:02:23] that all the children would be unique
[1:02:27] they would be unique they will have uh
[1:02:29] uh uh you know some unique
[1:02:31] things of themselves but yet
[1:02:35] they will have something in common
[1:02:39] that makes them to resemble
[1:02:49] and it was it is it is god himself
[1:02:52] that wrote that dna called
[1:03:00] amen
[1:03:02] praise the lord so that as i said we
[1:03:06] will look we will look into more
[1:03:08] we will look into more of there because
[1:03:10] if there is ever a time
[1:03:12] where we must we
[1:03:16] must anchor in the word of god
[1:03:20] it's this time
[1:03:24] praise the lord ever a time where we
[1:03:28] must anchor
[1:03:29] in the word of god i ain't got our faith
[1:03:32] because that's the only
[1:03:34] resting place you know that faith can
[1:03:37] rest is upon the word of god
[1:03:39] because because we will have
[1:03:45] troubling times troubling waters there
[1:03:46] are things that will happen
[1:03:48] you know that the only place you can
[1:03:51] turn to
[1:03:53] is the word of god thank you lord
[1:03:57] thank you praise the lord
[1:04:01] now there will be there will be nothing
[1:04:03] around you
[1:04:04] to bring you hope or comfort
[1:04:16] great intelligence great great great
[1:04:19] intelligence
[1:04:24] the first sentence in the torah
[1:04:28] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:04:31] and the earth
[1:04:33] seven words 28
[1:04:38] letters
[1:04:42] and it can just roll on and roll on and
[1:04:45] roll
[1:04:45] on and roll on but uh uh
[1:04:48] and and and it is just god in simplicity
[1:04:53] that is just showing that my word is
[1:04:56] perfect
[1:04:57] because the number seven is perfection
[1:05:03] god first sentence that was
[1:05:06] that is reading is saying my word is
[1:05:10] perfect you can trust it
[1:05:20] amen
[1:05:26] well let's go to our our text tonight
[1:05:29] that we want to
[1:05:31] we want to speak on tonight
[1:05:35] i want i just want to take what paul
[1:05:36] says that in in in philippians
[1:05:39] chapter one he will have began
[1:05:42] a good work in you i just want to
[1:05:45] encourage us tonight
[1:05:47] as a church every one of us
[1:05:52] he will have began a good work
[1:05:56] in you he will
[1:05:59] have began a good work in you
[1:06:02] you have to identify the one that have
[1:06:05] began
[1:06:06] a work in you if there's a work in you
[1:06:09] you have to identify
[1:06:10] he will have began a good work
[1:06:14] in you it's so amazing
[1:06:18] it's so amazing i pray that the lord
[1:06:20] will just
[1:06:21] add the blessing to his word amen
[1:06:24] and uh so let's let's just go back to
[1:06:27] that text again like i said
[1:06:30] i feel uh a bit uh
[1:06:33] uh you know personal when i read that
[1:06:36] and uh like paul says here i will
[1:06:39] start there from uh verse two grace
[1:06:43] unto you and peace from god now it's
[1:06:45] it's very amazing here
[1:06:47] you'll realize that paul used his
[1:06:49] greeting all the time
[1:06:52] grace and peace grace and peace
[1:06:55] because actually is grace that brings
[1:06:58] peace
[1:07:01] is the grace of god that brings peace
[1:07:04] and then in
[1:07:05] another sense is is
[1:07:08] is is greetings to two group of people
[1:07:11] grace to the gentiles
[1:07:13] peace actually the root word that is
[1:07:15] shalom we know that
[1:07:17] grace and peace from god and from the
[1:07:20] lord jesus i
[1:07:21] thank my god upon every
[1:07:24] remembrance of you
[1:07:28] praise the lord
[1:07:31] to know that
[1:07:34] god has given us a body
[1:07:39] like paul says in ephesians a body that
[1:07:43] is fitly
[1:07:43] joined together praise the lord
[1:07:49] you see this body that we have it is so
[1:07:52] easy for us to
[1:07:54] we all learn to identify you know the
[1:07:57] members of our body
[1:07:59] and the only ones that we identify and
[1:08:01] we all know
[1:08:03] is the visible ones that we can see
[1:08:06] yes but there are other parts of our
[1:08:09] body
[1:08:10] that are so important think about the
[1:08:13] heart
[1:08:13] think about your lungs think about your
[1:08:15] kidney think about your intestine think
[1:08:18] about your brain
[1:08:19] you know and uh uh and to just think
[1:08:23] about
[1:08:24] how god
[1:08:28] puts
[1:08:36] this body together
[1:08:40] how he put this body together and
[1:08:44] the body that you that we have here and
[1:08:47] we enjoy
[1:08:49] and we love if you don't love yours i
[1:08:51] don't know what's wrong with you
[1:08:54] that we love starts
[1:08:57] from a seed it starts from a seed
[1:09:08] and that is the same way
[1:09:12] this body this mystical body
[1:09:16] started from a seed
[1:09:20] the thing that have drawn us here
[1:09:22] together tonight
[1:09:24] is not nationality
[1:09:29] is the seed incorruptible
[1:09:34] that is the word of god
[1:09:41] think about it now and you just think
[1:09:44] about
[1:09:45] what paul says i thank my god
[1:09:48] upon every remembrance of you
[1:09:53] if you think you just go back in your
[1:09:55] mind and you travel
[1:09:57] a little bit and you think about all the
[1:10:00] places you have gone or the things you
[1:10:02] have done
[1:10:03] you go back 10 years from now
[1:10:06] i mean uh some of you knew one another
[1:10:09] those that were here in this local
[1:10:10] church you knew one another
[1:10:12] but you can even push it back to the
[1:10:14] time where you never knew one another
[1:10:18] you can push it as far back when you
[1:10:21] never
[1:10:21] knew not a brother in this assembly not
[1:10:25] a sister in this assembly
[1:10:26] i would even say push it back when you
[1:10:28] never even knew your wife
[1:10:34] and he never even knew how many children
[1:10:36] you have you never even thought of what
[1:10:38] name you would give them
[1:10:39] if you just push it back and you
[1:10:42] just travel in your mind a little bit to
[1:10:45] see
[1:10:46] how by design
[1:10:50] we all sit here tonight
[1:10:54] from a seed sure that was in the mind of
[1:10:57] god
[1:11:02] from a seed thought that was in the mind
[1:11:06] of god
[1:11:21] paul says always in every prayer
[1:11:24] of mine i remember you in every prayer
[1:11:28] of mine for
[1:11:29] for you all making requests with joy i'm
[1:11:33] making requests upon you
[1:11:35] for our fellowship in the gospel
[1:11:38] from the first day until now
[1:11:42] i remember the first day i walked
[1:11:43] through this through these doors of this
[1:11:46] church
[1:11:47] brother joe falling was preaching and uh
[1:11:51] i know i just just throw in and and
[1:11:54] without no introduction came in and just
[1:11:56] sat down
[1:11:58] praise the lord and virgil funny was
[1:12:01] preaching
[1:12:02] and i remember exactly the moment i was
[1:12:04] sitting right there
[1:12:05] and then he was saying something about a
[1:12:07] good friend brother something tail you
[1:12:09] want to be with the lord
[1:12:10] you know he was talking something about
[1:12:11] ghana and he mentioned brother sampson
[1:12:13] ted
[1:12:14] and he looked in my direction he said
[1:12:16] you know brother samson
[1:12:17] i said yes i know him it looks like i
[1:12:20] know you
[1:12:21] you know and then the service just went
[1:12:23] different you know because we started
[1:12:24] talking personal things when he's
[1:12:26] supposed to be preaching
[1:12:28] you know yeah
[1:12:32] but the fellowship in the gospel
[1:12:36] from the first day until now
[1:12:42] our fellowship has been in the gospel
[1:12:47] from the first day until
[1:12:50] now praise the lord
[1:12:54] and i will say let our fellowship
[1:12:56] continue in the gospel
[1:12:59] from now on to the coming of the lord
[1:13:02] let it not go into tradition let it not
[1:13:05] go into
[1:13:06] nationality letting that go into
[1:13:10] nothing but let it continue in the
[1:13:12] gospel of jesus christ
[1:13:14] to the coming of the lord amen
[1:13:19] and this is what i want to bring us to
[1:13:24] being confident and i'll say it i would
[1:13:26] say in my mind
[1:13:27] you know when i when i look back you
[1:13:29] know i sat there
[1:13:31] you know and and brother joe preach and
[1:13:34] then you know things went
[1:13:35] on but i i could see one one
[1:13:38] one quality that i could see there is
[1:13:41] there with everything that was happening
[1:13:42] at the time you know uh
[1:13:44] uh one thing i saw
[1:13:47] i saw the the love that the people have
[1:13:50] for the world
[1:13:50] no matter how the world was coming
[1:13:52] whether we were playing tip
[1:13:54] whether we were watching video whatever
[1:13:56] it was there was
[1:13:57] just a love for the world that was
[1:14:00] something that
[1:14:01] i was attracted to and most especially
[1:14:04] the young people at that time sister
[1:14:05] annette's sister catherine back there
[1:14:07] the lord and
[1:14:10] sister of faith and uh
[1:14:15] uh adam
[1:14:18] and you know yeah the few of them i
[1:14:21] just just i just in my you know i just
[1:14:24] sat down
[1:14:25] i just trying to be innocent but i was
[1:14:28] just observing
[1:14:30] but i was attracted to that
[1:14:34] and paul says here he says being
[1:14:37] confident being
[1:14:40] comforting and that's what i want to do
[1:14:42] tonight if the lord can help me
[1:14:44] i don't know if i can do it i trust the
[1:14:46] lord to be able to do it
[1:14:48] is to bring us to this place where
[1:14:51] we have to be confident
[1:14:54] of the one that has begin
[1:14:58] the work in you
[1:15:02] praise the lord we have to be
[1:15:06] confident of the one
[1:15:09] that have began the work
[1:15:12] in you he began the work
[1:15:15] when you are not even there just like i
[1:15:19] said
[1:15:20] it was a seed
[1:15:23] in his mind
[1:15:27] praise the lord amen
[1:15:31] i mean for you to be able to for you to
[1:15:34] be able to get away
[1:15:36] from god you have to go back to that
[1:15:38] thought
[1:15:39] yes right and you have to make god to
[1:15:43] forget about his thought
[1:15:46] that he thought of you right
[1:15:51] and that's why that jeremiah said i know
[1:15:53] the thought
[1:15:55] that i've taught of you and when he
[1:15:58] thought of you
[1:15:59] you were not even there right

[1:16:08] you try the only thing you will be doing
[1:16:10] you will just be
[1:16:11] building a lot of regret for yourself
[1:16:19] the better thing that any any loving
[1:16:22] person that love themself
[1:16:24] can do is to just surround them
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:32] you make it a lot easier
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:36] when you surrender

[1:16:49] that he wish begin
[1:16:53] he didn't say begin the work begin a
[1:16:55] good
[1:16:56] work from the very beginning it was a
[1:16:59] good work
[1:17:02] and because it was a good work from the
[1:17:04] beginning they have to finish as

[1:17:21] it was good the fifth day it was good
[1:17:24] the sixth day it was very good
[1:17:31] so when almighty god begins a world he

[1:20:09] and paul says he will
[1:20:12] perform it amen
[1:20:17] a carried the sense of continuous
[1:20:20] good work that's the reason why for
[1:20:23] for a child of god it can only get
[1:20:25] better
[1:20:28] it can only get better it has one way to
[1:20:31] go
[1:20:32] and is to get better from glory unto
[1:20:35] glory
[1:20:35] unto glory unto glory
[1:20:40] praise the lord amen
[1:20:44] because every time he put us through a
[1:20:46] triad
[1:20:47] is to just bring us out much brighter
[1:20:50] than we were before
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:52] it's just to beat the draws out of our
[1:20:55] life
[1:20:56] so we can shine more brighter than we
[1:20:58] ever shine before
[1:20:59] so for the child of god everything like
[1:21:02] paul said
[1:21:03] for all things work for good that's
[1:21:05] right
[1:21:06] to them that love the lord
[1:21:14] amen thank you jesus
[1:21:17] okay to begin a good work in you
[1:21:20] and that's the way i feel about it
[1:21:23] praise the lord
[1:21:25] i feel that he that have began a good
[1:21:28] work
[1:21:30] on the corner of this street
[1:21:33] sister 900 humboldt avenue
[1:21:37] praise the lord he that have began
[1:21:41] a good work unless it's the work of man
[1:21:43] is going to fail
[1:21:45] amen that's the reason why we
[1:21:48] we do everything to put our shoulder and
[1:21:50] lift up the preeminence of jesus christ
[1:21:54] we gotta praise him we got to lift the
[1:21:56] name of jesus christ up
[1:21:58] because he said if i be lifted up that's
[1:22:01] right
[1:22:01] i will draw you every time we break we
[1:22:05] lift the name of jesus
[1:22:06] up he brings us up
[1:22:12] praise the lord amen
[1:22:16] he that have began a good work in you
[1:22:19] will perform it
[1:22:22] he will perform it over and over you see
[1:22:25] that you see that word
[1:22:30] in the old testament
[1:22:34] let me let me just show you a little bit
[1:22:37] of what
[1:22:37] i'm talking about here
[1:22:44] praise the lord
[1:22:52] you find that over and over in the in
[1:22:54] the prophecy
[1:22:56] of of our lord jesus christ
[1:23:06] oh praise the lord amen
[1:23:11] now if you look over especially you look
[1:23:14] over in the book of isaiah that would be
[1:23:16] one of the
[1:23:17] the the commonplace
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:23] isaiah chapter nine
[1:23:36] when when the uh
[1:23:40] when the word uh you know as i
[1:23:42] prophesied about a virgin shall conceive
[1:23:49] verse 7 it says and and of the increase
[1:23:52] of his government
[1:23:53] and the peace there shall be no end upon
[1:23:57] the throne of
[1:23:58] david and upon his
[1:24:01] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[1:24:05] with joshua and with justice and from
[1:24:08] henceforth
[1:24:08] even forever the zeal of the lord of
[1:24:12] hosts
[1:24:13] will perform this
[1:24:19] that word or that phrase has the
[1:24:22] expression
[1:24:24] like brother branham said god will rob
[1:24:26] the bank of heaven
[1:24:30] he will rob heaven
[1:24:33] just so his word will not fail
[1:24:38] the view of the lord will perform it
[1:24:41] god will put all of his might
[1:24:45] behind his promise to bring it to pass
[1:24:52] praise the lord
[1:24:57] amen
[1:25:01] and and and over and over
[1:25:04] through the scripture you can you can go
[1:25:06] home and just and put it up and on your
[1:25:08] search and see that over and over
[1:25:10] how many times it's expressed in the
[1:25:12] scripture but here paul
[1:25:14] is using that same sense of word here
[1:25:17] to say that he that began the good work
[1:25:21] in you
[1:25:23] he began it he's not going to leave it
[1:25:28] over to the hands of infinite man
[1:25:33] praise the lord he's not going to leave
[1:25:36] it over
[1:25:37] to the hands of uh uh
[1:25:40] not even the hands of angels
[1:25:46] but he that have began that work
[1:25:49] yes will perform it what he have began
[1:25:54] what he saw in his mind
[1:25:59] he's going to perform it he's going to
[1:26:01] he's going to realize it he's going to
[1:26:03] bring it
[1:26:04] to fulfill me
[1:26:09] just like when he started creation in
[1:26:12] genesis
[1:26:13] and he says let there be light
[1:26:18] it is a world i mean angels now i have
[1:26:21] created a lie you go and do the rest no
[1:26:24] right
[1:26:27] praise the lord what he started
[1:26:33] he went on six days
[1:26:37] he got himself a perfect eating
[1:26:41] created everything
[1:26:46] what he started what he began he
[1:26:48] performed
[1:26:53] so he they have began a good work in you
[1:27:02] praise the lord
[1:27:06] he will perform it until the day
[1:27:12] of our lord jesus praise the lord
[1:27:24] that's the god that we serve amen
[1:27:29] and when you look back in the beginning
[1:27:31] when god
[1:27:32] started his work
[1:27:36] over in revelation the bible talks about
[1:27:38] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:27:42] when god begins anything he begins it
[1:27:47] with his word
[1:27:51] when god begins anything
[1:27:55] he begin it with his word
[1:27:59] god do not start anything without
[1:28:02] his word
[1:28:05] praise the lord because the only thing
[1:28:08] that has
[1:28:09] the power to produce itself
[1:28:15] it's the word of god
[1:28:18] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:28:21] don't stand
[1:28:23] you know what i you know you know my
[1:28:25] brother you know
[1:28:27] was talking to me one time being away
[1:28:30] from church and
[1:28:31] and then you call me up and says you
[1:28:33] know what you know bruanna
[1:28:35] you know i i need to find a church in
[1:28:37] this area and
[1:28:38] you know and he was talking to me i told
[1:28:41] him i said brother
[1:28:43] that's a good thing that's a good thing
[1:28:45] i can give you contact
[1:28:46] and you know and contact you with the
[1:28:48] brothers dead and all of that
[1:28:49] but let me advise you let me advise you
[1:28:53] my advice would be
[1:28:57] start with the word
[1:29:01] what you need is not church
[1:29:04] you don't need church sure
[1:29:08] i said you think about it how long you
[1:29:10] been in the church and you still went
[1:29:11] astray
[1:29:13] amen what you need now
[1:29:17] is you must start with the word let that
[1:29:19] word become
[1:29:21] a person to you when the word become
[1:29:24] person to you no matter where the word
[1:29:26] is you will go there
[1:29:28] if it is three hours you will drive if i
[1:29:31] show you a church
[1:29:33] and you go there after one week and you
[1:29:35] realize that is
[1:29:36] one hour drive brother that place too
[1:29:38] far that a complaint you will get
[1:29:40] because
[1:29:40] it's church you are going to but if you
[1:29:43] have come in contact with the world
[1:29:45] if even six hours away you would go
[1:29:48] there
[1:29:49] because the world has become a person
[1:29:53] to you amen
[1:29:58] if you want to start start with the word
[1:30:06] praise the lord
[1:30:09] when god starts anything for the great
[1:30:13] unimportant god the great internal
[1:30:16] spirit
[1:30:17] to even begin time he had to condense
[1:30:20] himself
[1:30:22] to a body called the logos which was the
[1:30:24] word
[1:30:25] in the beginning the first form of god
[1:30:30] was the word that's the reason why when
[1:30:32] you know god by the word
[1:30:35] when you know god by his word
[1:30:40] there is no doctrine no seducing spirit
[1:30:45] there is no false teaching that can
[1:30:47] bewitch you
[1:30:48] from this glorious truth
[1:30:52] because you're now only listening to
[1:30:54] cults you have met the man
[1:30:55] that wears the court
[1:31:04] praise the lord amen
[1:31:07] god begins with his word
[1:31:18] so when god began a good work
[1:31:22] in you
[1:31:26] he was not chasing your physical body or
[1:31:29] your earthly structure
[1:31:31] he was planting that word
[1:31:35] trying to plant that word
[1:31:38] in your heart
[1:31:44] trying to blame that word trying to to
[1:31:47] to cultivate your life
[1:31:49] of all of the genetic struggle and
[1:31:53] dysfunction
[1:31:55] so that word can start to produce itself
[1:32:07] because when god started work he start
[1:32:10] with his word
[1:32:15] because god is attracted to his word
[1:32:18] god is obligated to his word
[1:32:22] that's why he will protect you because
[1:32:25] his word is there that's why he gave his
[1:32:28] injuries charged over you
[1:32:30] because his word is there actually it's
[1:32:32] his word that he's protecting
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:39] it's not your physical body
[1:32:42] god is protecting his word he's watching
[1:32:46] over his word
[1:32:47] he's obligated to his word
[1:32:54] praise the lord you know when
[1:32:57] we read that scripture over and over
[1:33:02] when god when abraham took isaac on the
[1:33:06] mountain
[1:33:08] and isaac asks his dad lord the altar is
[1:33:11] ready where is the sacrifice
[1:33:14] most of the time we read it in it and we
[1:33:16] read god will provide
[1:33:20] but read it again god will provide
[1:33:24] for himself that's right
[1:33:28] god will provide for himself
[1:33:33] when he's called jehovah jarrah is not
[1:33:35] to provide for you
[1:33:37] is to provide for himself
[1:33:43] praise the lord god provide for himself
[1:33:48] in your life that's why he don't give
[1:33:51] you everything you ask for
[1:33:52] right because he's not providing for you
[1:33:54] he's providing for himself
[1:33:57] right
[1:34:01] praise the lord
[1:34:06] but what are we talking about tonight
[1:34:08] let's just look at a few scriptures
[1:34:11] and then i will read a quote or two here
[1:34:16] are we together
[1:34:20] you love the lord
[1:34:24] praise the lord
[1:34:29] we realize that paul carried this
[1:34:31] thought
[1:34:36] throughout
[1:34:42] in ephesians chapter 2
[1:34:45] verse 10
[1:34:49] he says for we are his workmanship
[1:34:55] we are his workmanship
[1:34:58] created in christ jesus
[1:35:02] unto good works
[1:35:06] amen which god has
[1:35:09] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:35:17] so everything that he's doing with our
[1:35:19] life
[1:35:22] is to produce a good work praise the
[1:35:25] lord
[1:35:26] at the end of the day is going to turn
[1:35:28] out good and beautiful
[1:35:29] amen we are his workmanship
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:42] created in christ jesus unto good work
[1:35:44] which god has
[1:35:46] already ordained and then when when he
[1:35:49] saw
[1:35:49] that see taught about you
[1:35:55] it was for you to come in bring good
[1:35:57] fruits
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:06] here begin a good work
[1:36:19] second corinthians chapter nine verse
[1:36:21] eight paul also says he
[1:36:22] is and god is able to make all grace
[1:36:26] abound towards you
[1:36:27] thy yet always having all
[1:36:31] sufficiency in all things
[1:36:34] may abound to every good
[1:36:38] work
[1:36:41] to every good work
[1:36:48] just like i said a a a genesis 1
[1:36:51] principle must always keep that in our
[1:36:56] mind
[1:36:57] genesis 1 principle from the day that he
[1:37:04] started
[1:37:06] when he came to the end it was good
[1:37:10] that's right amen
[1:37:13] it was good now god is almighty
[1:37:16] all powerful why i mean you could have
[1:37:20] just
[1:37:20] created everything you are just you just
[1:37:25] speak a word and everything will have
[1:37:27] just
[1:37:28] been created one day everything is done
[1:37:31] but you see it all goes back to that
[1:37:33] same pattern
[1:37:35] principle god had to take
[1:37:39] day and the next day and the next day
[1:37:43] why because he's showing us a principle
[1:37:46] he's showing us a pattern
[1:37:53] god in in his principle he does not have
[1:37:57] uh uh uh you know a quick face one day
[1:38:01] magic got no no he works he works
[1:38:04] by parting by principle
[1:38:11] i mean it will have just been easy put
[1:38:13] the seed to the ground the next day the
[1:38:14] tree just grow
[1:38:17] no but there is there is a pattern there
[1:38:20] is a principle
[1:38:26] and every step and every stage of our
[1:38:29] life
[1:38:30] he has to bring a good product at the
[1:38:33] end
[1:38:34] right then he moved us to the next stage
[1:38:37] of our life
[1:38:38] sometimes it's hard for us to see it
[1:38:43] why because we are workmanship he we are
[1:38:46] the one that he's working on
[1:38:48] you are not sitting there and god is
[1:38:49] working and you are looking no you are
[1:38:51] the one that he's working on
[1:38:53] so sometimes it's hard for you to see
[1:38:55] the good that is coming out of it
[1:38:58] because you are the one that he's
[1:38:59] working on
[1:39:05] praise the lord
[1:39:25] collusion chapter 1 verse 10 paul says
[1:39:29] that yeah my work wealthy
[1:39:30] of the lord unto all pleasing
[1:39:34] being fruitful in every good work
[1:39:38] and increasing in the knowledge of god
[1:39:47] so his very taught about us
[1:39:52] was to walk
[1:39:56] in good work
[1:40:01] praise the lord amen
[1:40:05] he has began
[1:40:13] there's good work in you he will perform
[1:40:16] it
[1:40:18] till the end let me share this with you
[1:40:19] and then we pray
[1:40:23] what is the holy ghost giving for we
[1:40:25] have we have been since
[1:40:26] adam god the father
[1:40:29] was over moses and the children of
[1:40:32] israel
[1:40:33] in the pillar of fire then god
[1:40:38] with us in christ walking with us
[1:40:41] talk with us eat with us slept with us
[1:40:44] god over us god with us and now
[1:40:48] is god in us
[1:40:52] praise the lord now is god
[1:40:55] in us that's what the holy ghost is
[1:41:01] it's god
[1:41:05] in us
[1:41:09] and we must learn to appreciate it
[1:41:13] you know the church word
[1:41:16] has has has you know make us to think
[1:41:19] that
[1:41:20] sometimes we are the ones that are that
[1:41:23] are working out our ways you know
[1:41:25] working
[1:41:25] you know working our salvation even when
[1:41:28] you read that scripture where paul says
[1:41:31] you know uh uh you know work out your
[1:41:34] salvation
[1:41:35] with fear and trembling at the end of
[1:41:37] the statement he says
[1:41:38] it is christ that worketh in you
[1:41:45] amen and that is the reason why
[1:41:48] you know uh uh god has called us to
[1:41:52] partnership
[1:41:54] redemption is is a work of partnership
[1:41:59] he has called
[1:42:00] us to partnership that's the reason why
[1:42:02] all the time i say is when god
[1:42:05] shows something in your life that seems
[1:42:07] to be like a flaw
[1:42:08] and all seems to be like something you
[1:42:10] don't like it's not to embarrass you
[1:42:14] he wants to work with you
[1:42:18] because that's the only way he can call
[1:42:20] you an overcomer
[1:42:22] if he do it you are not an overcomer
[1:42:27] praise the lord amen he shows you he
[1:42:30] said here is that deal with
[1:42:31] it and he's he's right there with you
[1:42:34] he's not leaving you
[1:42:36] no no he's right there with you
[1:42:39] and you can just enjoy how the grace of
[1:42:42] god
[1:42:43] is helping you to overcome that thing
[1:42:53] this walk with god i'm telling you when
[1:42:55] eno walk with god
[1:42:57] he enjoys it
[1:43:00] when he walk with god he enjoys
[1:43:04] it praise the lord
[1:43:10] let's walk with god we must enjoy
[1:43:15] the holy ghost we must enjoy god dealing
[1:43:17] with our lives
[1:43:30] so is god in us all
[1:43:33] god was come into christ
[1:43:36] all christ was come into the church
[1:43:40] what is it god working
[1:43:43] in you
[1:43:47] any word in the word if he did want to
[1:43:51] call on you you are right
[1:43:54] there
[1:43:58] david said where can we go and hide from
[1:44:00] the lord
[1:44:01] that's right in a word if he wants to
[1:44:04] call on you you are right
[1:44:06] there working in you
[1:44:10] to do his good will
[1:44:14] how we ought to thank god for that
[1:44:17] how we ought to thank god for that
[1:44:21] god working in us to do his good will
[1:44:28] that's the reason why prayer must never
[1:44:32] be a burden
[1:44:36] david said i was glad when he said let's
[1:44:38] go to the house of the lord
[1:44:40] he said i was glad
[1:44:45] praise the lord
[1:44:53] even though we are living in a time
[1:44:56] where
[1:44:57] the culture the society is trying to
[1:45:00] to to detects to the young people and
[1:45:03] says wow this is
[1:45:04] this is the old-fashioned way you know
[1:45:06] you you you have to follow your heart
[1:45:08] you have to
[1:45:09] follow your and and you know the reality
[1:45:12] there is the other
[1:45:16] we all realize i mean all of these
[1:45:17] people that are saying that
[1:45:19] when it comes to that time
[1:45:25] when it comes to that moment in their
[1:45:26] life
[1:45:29] what about illness what a
[1:45:32] what a close to death moment
[1:45:36] when they come from out of there they
[1:45:38] realize the supernatural being some way
[1:45:43] that if it was not for god that's right
[1:45:47] they realize that there is a super even
[1:45:49] though they don't want to
[1:45:50] admit it
[1:45:53] but it's they realize there is a god
[1:45:56] that was
[1:45:57] intelligence this word is governed
[1:46:06] praise the lord
[1:46:10] so we ought to be thankful
[1:46:14] we ought to be thankful
[1:46:22] young people you ought to be thankful
[1:46:26] that god has started dealing with you
[1:46:29] in in your youthful age
[1:46:33] praise the lord a lot of the things
[1:46:38] that you might escape
[1:46:41] if you hold on to this confession
[1:46:47] so young people think you have to go in
[1:46:49] and lay foolish in the world for you to
[1:46:51] experience god
[1:46:52] god's grace god love you
[1:46:56] you will still experience it but as a
[1:46:58] human
[1:46:59] one thing you can do is forget
[1:47:04] when those flashbacks come back to your
[1:47:06] mind
[1:47:15] how we ought to thank god for that god
[1:47:19] the holy spirit is sent for the purpose
[1:47:23] of god living in his church
[1:47:26] moving through each age working out
[1:47:30] his divine will
[1:47:34] god working out his divine will
[1:47:45] are we together
[1:47:48] ever pressing water today
[1:47:52] we got the word we follow the word
[1:47:55] and we see the word working in the
[1:47:58] believer
[1:48:00] and we know
[1:48:03] we know it's so then god

[1:48:10] with signs and wonders
[1:48:13] we stay with the word the word
[1:48:17] produce the result
[1:48:23] we don't have to make makeup things

[1:48:38] have to make up
[1:48:39] spiritual dreams we don't have to make a
[1:48:41] spiritual gift
