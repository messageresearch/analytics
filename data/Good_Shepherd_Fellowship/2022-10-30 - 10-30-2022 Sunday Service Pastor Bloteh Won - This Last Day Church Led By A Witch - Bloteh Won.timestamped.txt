[47:09] about uh all that the Lord have said we
[47:12] will do we know that we cannot do or
[47:14] that the Lord have said we have to rely
[47:16] on his grace amen trying to talk about
[47:20] appreciating the grace of God and uh
[47:24] uh
[47:27] uh I wanted to do something this morning
[47:30] and uh and I'm still going to trust the
[47:33] Lord to see if uh if we would do that
[47:36] but just before we do that first brother
[47:38] Dan reminded me and uh uh our brother
[47:41] Ben uh given an announcement uh yeah
[47:46] last week for the for the I think
[47:48] Thanksgiving and open house at the Ali's
[47:52] place I think that's that's brother Dan
[47:55] and his family opening their home and uh
[47:59] they have not had the privilege to
[48:00] invite the sins to their home since they
[48:04] moved there so they choose to do that on
[48:07] Thanksgiving and because I was curious
[48:10] to know whether it was a church
[48:12] Thanksgiving or the home Thanksgiving so
[48:15] they said home Thanksgiving so uh that
[48:18] was that was the correction from there
[48:20] so but then reminding me to do that and
[48:23] uh we we want to thank the Lord the Lord
[48:26] has been good to us us amen as a people
[48:29] he has been good to us as a church and
[48:32] uh
[48:35] but this was something that I that I
[48:37] observed and I taught a wise you know
[48:40] that that I should learn from it
[48:44] and uh uh I was going away and we were
[48:49] we were helping the situation and
[48:52] preaching some services
[48:54] and and one night I was up what I was
[48:58] studying and I was praying and and the
[49:00] thought just hit me and because I was
[49:04] thinking about a situation I was
[49:06] thinking that you know how how did the
[49:08] people got in the situation that they
[49:11] got themselves in
[49:12] and then I remember some things that
[49:14] brother Braham said in the church age
[49:16] book you know he was talking about the
[49:19] church in his struggle which of course
[49:22] the next morning when I was preaching I
[49:24] sharing with the church you know the
[49:26] church in his struggle you know to get
[49:28] away from the grip of catholism the
[49:31] grape of legalism and he has struggle to
[49:35] get away from legalizing they went far
[49:38] away from the grace of God
[49:42] now like like we said on Wednesday night
[49:45] brother Graham said we read it he says
[49:47] Grace was before the Lord
[49:50] he said Grace well even during the Lord
[49:55] and Grace was after the Lord
[49:59] praise the Lord so even during the time
[50:02] of the Lord during the time when the
[50:04] people are under this thing of of a
[50:07] bondage and and legalism from the church
[50:10] there is still Grace there now so what
[50:13] the church needs as us as God a little
[50:17] bit we will show you this morning will
[50:19] will deliver the people from there they
[50:23] need to follow the grace of God
[50:26] praise the Lord but what happened is
[50:28] that the people this is all we we are we
[50:31] are we are we are we we are not on a
[50:33] legal lesson we are so bound you know we
[50:35] are free and are in the sense of Freedom
[50:38] they go completely away from the grace
[50:41] of God and then this this starts to
[50:44] allow things
[50:46] that they will have never allowed in
[50:48] their life
[50:50] and and you see those things you cannot
[50:53] help but ask God to give you Grace that
[50:55] you learn from it so I think uh you know
[50:59] I would say is that God has blessed us
[51:01] as a church
[51:02] praise the Lord I mean this this local
[51:05] assembly he has blessed us as a church I
[51:08] was I will also say that uh he's
[51:11] blessing us in our growth uh the growth
[51:15] that I'm talking about is not Amiga
[51:17] church it's not a many member of you
[51:19] know people I'm talking about people
[51:22] growing in the Lord you know in a way
[51:25] they are dealing with things and uh you
[51:28] know the Lord is also blessing people in
[51:31] their jobs in their homes and uh and and
[51:34] and all of those things but you see what
[51:37] happens with the human because we uh uh
[51:41] you know uh creature of habit
[51:44] uh when when uh when when the law starts
[51:48] to bless us in this way pretty soon we
[51:52] start becoming Slack and we start
[51:55] turning away from the very thing that
[51:57] have brought us these blessings
[51:59] praise the lord we start attributing the
[52:02] blessings to our many hours that we work
[52:06] attributing the blessings to the new job
[52:08] that we got and the degree that we have
[52:11] just got just tell our you know our
[52:13] upgrade my degrading that and then
[52:16] pretty soon we start attributing the
[52:18] blessings of God to those things
[52:20] whether those things were there on that
[52:23] God will stay bless us
[52:27] praise the Lord
[52:29] amen whether those things were there or
[52:32] not God will stay bless us
[52:35] praise the Lord he's a good God Amen
[52:41] and then pretty soon just like I said
[52:43] the people you know we will soon start
[52:46] turning away you know from uh from uh
[52:49] from prayer meeting and uh you know and
[52:53] now now we we will not have time again
[52:56] even to be be to church on time you know
[52:59] we we come to Service as if to say the
[53:02] service have to wait for us instead of
[53:04] coming to wait on the service you know
[53:07] that's what brother Branham said he says
[53:09] that's the reason why gifts have gone
[53:10] from the church because the people don't
[53:12] come and wait
[53:14] you know they don't come and wait
[53:17] praise the lord we want God to wait on
[53:20] us when we have to be here waiting on
[53:22] the Lord and waiting and praying the
[53:25] service time is it's 10 o'clock the
[53:27] doors are open we're supposed to be in
[53:29] praying and and waiting on the service
[53:31] praise the Lord you see those those are
[53:34] just the simple principle that brings
[53:36] God's blessing
[53:37] praise the Lord is a simple principle I
[53:40] mean we don't have to be one in the
[53:42] engine yet and you know trying to uh
[53:45] chase people down and say so this other
[53:48] person is doing this and this other
[53:49] person is doing this no we don't have to
[53:51] look for the devil let's look for God we
[53:53] will find him because God is head and
[53:57] revealed in Simplicity if he's he then
[54:00] look for God you will find him stop
[54:03] looking for the devil
[54:05] because the devil is all over the place
[54:07] you want to see him you will see him he
[54:09] won't see Satan behind the puppet this
[54:11] morning you will see him
[54:16] praise the Lord
[54:18] amen
[54:20] so I mean that would just be uh my
[54:24] conscious advice to you as a church you
[54:27] know uh let's let's let's let's uh let's
[54:30] hold those things that were very
[54:31] valuable to us amen
[54:34] praise the Lord hallelujah
[54:37] let's hold those things God I mean the
[54:39] Lord has been good to us he has been
[54:42] very very good to us and uh uh you know
[54:45] it's it's also some of those things with
[54:48] with uh with children and parents you
[54:50] know we grow up like some of our young
[54:52] people you are blessed to have parents
[54:54] that always want to be in church and you
[54:57] and you come with them you come with
[54:58] them and then pretty soon you start
[55:00] becoming an adult you start you start
[55:03] working you get your apartment and all
[55:06] of that and uh you know uh I mean you
[55:09] you never knew how he has got in a car
[55:11] you never knew how the car was repaired
[55:14] you know you just had it and now pretty
[55:16] soon you get your card and and then you
[55:19] start using yours now for for an excuse
[55:21] or my car break then I can make it to
[55:23] church today
[55:24] all those things you are experiencing
[55:26] that they were experiencing it it's just
[55:29] that he was not making a kind of a noise
[55:31] that you are making now
[55:37] praise the Lord
[55:40] now I wanted to uh
[55:44] are you going to do
[55:46] my special I requested you're able to do
[55:48] it okay I wanted to do something uh uh
[55:52] in honor
[55:54] of
[55:57] you know the the the beginning of the
[56:00] Reformation I call it the first nail in
[56:03] the coffin
[56:05] when Martin Luther's two out
[56:08] and and and he was led by the Holy
[56:12] Spirit
[56:14] to write those 95 Theses
[56:19] and put it on the church door the All
[56:21] Saints Church
[56:23] that was
[56:25] the first nail
[56:27] that God puts in the devil coffin
[56:32] praise the Lord
[56:34] amen thou was the first snail
[56:38] and
[56:40] there's there's a whole lot that I have
[56:42] to to deal with this morning I'm just
[56:44] praying and hoping that the Lord will
[56:46] just be able to to you know uh uh you
[56:51] know compress me just help me praise the
[56:54] Lord and and if you can yeah you know
[56:56] because sometimes the church can just
[56:58] can just sweep the preacher out of his
[57:00] notes I know you can do that so if you
[57:03] can pull I might just run out of my
[57:04] notes so quickly and then but you see uh
[57:07] uh
[57:10] let me get ahead of myself
[57:12] tomorrow is Halloween
[57:15] amen
[57:17] and do you know
[57:19] that that was the very same day
[57:22] Luther put the thesis
[57:24] on the All Saints Church
[57:28] do you know that
[57:30] oh you are out for the treat
[57:34] I can promise you are for the tree if
[57:36] you didn't know that you are for the
[57:38] treat
[57:39] praise the Lord
[57:45] and my question when I was studying last
[57:47] night well yesterday
[57:49] I wrote something down here I said why
[57:51] didn't the religious word the word
[57:53] council of churches
[57:55] make a big celebration
[57:58] of
[58:01] the day of the Reformation
[58:04] why why because as as we will go into
[58:08] detail this morning
[58:11] Halloween is a 2.4 billion dollar hmm
[58:18] Market
[58:20] 2.4 billion dollar
[58:23] Market just last night when I got home I
[58:26] was listening to the news in South Korea
[58:30] a Halloween party killed 150 people
[58:38] at their Halloween party
[58:45] it's a 2.4 billion dollar
[58:48] is the 10 most popular party
[58:53] uh
[58:54] party activity in America
[58:57] next to uh New Year Eve in Super Bowl
[59:04] that's American statistics is the 10
[59:07] biggest party night
[59:09] next to New Year Eve in Super Bowl
[59:12] it's a 2.4 million there are billion
[59:15] dollar market business
[59:23] praise the Lord
[59:30] and uh
[59:32] as we as we as we will look into some of
[59:35] the things that I would like to share
[59:37] with you this morning
[59:39] is to be able to show you how there are
[59:43] a lot of things in our culture
[59:46] that uh that are from Pagan's root
[59:50] they are from Pagan Road
[59:54] they are Roman traditions
[59:57] praise the Lord
[59:59] and believing Christians are falling in
[1:00:02] love with faith
[1:00:09] all or most of our days of the week
[1:00:12] months of the year
[1:00:16] strangely not that uh
[1:00:18] Exodus chapter 12
[1:00:23] God told Israel
[1:00:26] that this month
[1:00:28] will be for you the beginning of months
[1:00:32] God was setting up a new calendar for
[1:00:34] them
[1:00:36] at the beginning of months and what what
[1:00:38] will be their beginning was to pass over
[1:00:41] what is the Christian beginning is a new
[1:00:44] birth
[1:00:45] amen because if you are not born again
[1:00:48] you have no right eating communion
[1:00:56] so the Passover is is is our new
[1:01:00] beginning this is our beginning of
[1:01:01] months
[1:01:03] now so we we see all of those things
[1:01:07] we we know that uh you know Christmas is
[1:01:10] a big Babylonian tradition
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:15] all of his celebration uh you know
[1:01:17] Christmas Street in one of you even even
[1:01:20] Easter
[1:01:23] it's all from the goddess of Asian
[1:01:26] Babylon
[1:01:28] the biggest thing around around it is
[1:01:31] the other uh extra the the golden egg
[1:01:35] it is all in honor of the worship of the
[1:01:39] god of fatality
[1:01:42] you know how how do you how do you bring
[1:01:46] uh Easter rabbit and eggs together when
[1:01:50] did rabbit start laying eggs
[1:01:56] when the rabbits are laying eggs
[1:02:00] you know all of those things that are
[1:02:03] caught up in those things why why people
[1:02:07] that have gone to school in all of the
[1:02:09] degrees while Common Sense can just help
[1:02:12] them connect it
[1:02:16] that is a lie
[1:02:24] praise the Lord
[1:02:28] you know uh
[1:02:30] uh I mean even even our Valentine's Day
[1:02:33] also is a Roman feast uh
[1:02:38] that was that is attributed to to
[1:02:41] something else
[1:02:43] our childhood Tooth Fairy thing is an
[1:02:46] Asian Voodoo thing
[1:02:48] and all of that
[1:02:55] you know so and on and on and on and on
[1:02:58] we can go
[1:03:00] and uh and we will go
[1:03:02] because I have I have a whole lot to
[1:03:05] look into this morning just taking this
[1:03:07] to uh but as as I was thinking on this
[1:03:11] and just to realize that
[1:03:15] this big big uh celebration because uh
[1:03:19] uh we will look into the history of
[1:03:21] Halloween a little bit it has been a
[1:03:25] long a long tradition
[1:03:27] being a long tradition is is it came
[1:03:30] over newly to to America but it has been
[1:03:33] something that has been there in Europe
[1:03:36] for for a long time
[1:03:38] and it was even before before the
[1:03:41] Reformation
[1:03:43] but then I was thinking in my mind
[1:03:46] I was thinking in my mind I said
[1:03:49] I said God is just amazing
[1:03:53] praise the Lord I don't I don't I don't
[1:03:56] believe that it was a kind of a
[1:03:59] premeditated thing
[1:04:01] of Luther
[1:04:03] to say I'm going to wait for Halloween
[1:04:05] night
[1:04:06] I'm going to scare them with this thing
[1:04:10] praise the Lord
[1:04:12] I'm going to scare the church with this
[1:04:14] uh uh uh
[1:04:15] 195 theses
[1:04:18] but I believe that honor inspiration
[1:04:23] God did that
[1:04:27] God did that
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:34] almighty God himself did that
[1:04:38] to be able to Port
[1:04:40] uh uh it was like a signature
[1:04:46] God own handwriting
[1:04:53] but just like I said I was I was
[1:04:55] thinking on that and I wrote this down
[1:04:57] so I I can forget
[1:04:59] while they're in the religious world the
[1:05:01] World Council of churches set up a big
[1:05:04] big celebration
[1:05:07] because this was net
[1:05:11] an outward movement of God
[1:05:16] praise the Lord even though after the
[1:05:20] Reformation took fired in the Church of
[1:05:22] England separated from the Catholic
[1:05:25] Church
[1:05:26] then they came out with the All Saints
[1:05:28] Day
[1:05:29] November 1st
[1:05:32] they make November 1st All Saints Day
[1:05:35] and November 2nd became All Souls day
[1:05:40] a big celebration of uh purgatory
[1:05:48] praise the Lord
[1:05:52] so you see we we have all of these
[1:05:54] things around us
[1:05:56] all of these things surround us
[1:05:59] and uh and and we are not free from them
[1:06:02] if if God don't help us
[1:06:05] because all of these things are in are
[1:06:08] in the root of the church you know what
[1:06:09] the church has always done is that
[1:06:11] they're wrong with the same thing they
[1:06:13] just dress it in a new clothes
[1:06:18] they just change the dressing of their
[1:06:21] Idol
[1:06:22] but it's just the same old Idol
[1:06:25] that the church has always run with
[1:06:28] now so I was thinking about that I said
[1:06:31] because I felt in my mind that this was
[1:06:34] not an outward move you remember when
[1:06:36] when when when Elijah came in and stood
[1:06:40] on my Campbell when Elijah challenge
[1:06:44] the prophets of barn
[1:06:47] praise the Lord
[1:06:49] and after they did all of their crying
[1:06:51] they did all of their movement and
[1:06:53] everything and everything
[1:06:58] and it was about an evening time the
[1:07:00] Bible says Elijah took 12 Stones he he
[1:07:03] gathered the songs together then he says
[1:07:06] oh Lord God
[1:07:07] May Israel know that I have done
[1:07:10] everything I call into your word
[1:07:14] and let this be
[1:07:16] that which we turn the heart of the
[1:07:19] people
[1:07:20] back to you
[1:07:24] that's the emphasis of the Elijah
[1:07:26] Ministry turning the heart back that's
[1:07:28] the reason why Malachi pick up the same
[1:07:30] thing now so but
[1:07:34] Elijah prayed our prayer
[1:07:37] and we know that fire came down from
[1:07:39] heaven and consumed the sacrifice
[1:07:42] praise the Lord
[1:07:46] but did the heart of the people turn
[1:07:48] back
[1:07:50] so you see the move was not an artwork
[1:07:54] you you were thinking that after that
[1:07:56] great demonstration
[1:07:58] with fire coming down from heaven
[1:08:00] consuming the sacrifice drying up the
[1:08:03] water and burning the altar
[1:08:06] you will think that the heart of the
[1:08:08] people everybody with that Jehovah is
[1:08:11] God and it will get back and start
[1:08:12] worshiping God
[1:08:14] the worship of bar increase
[1:08:21] the reason there is because the move of
[1:08:25] God is not a artwork show
[1:08:31] it's not an hour show
[1:08:34] it's not something that we put on the
[1:08:36] outward
[1:08:37] something that God is doing in the heart
[1:08:40] of his people
[1:08:46] it's something that God is doing in the
[1:08:48] heart of his people because if the heart
[1:08:50] of man is not converted he can put up
[1:08:54] whatever he want to put up
[1:08:56] wickedness
[1:08:59] lies in his heart
[1:09:04] even to his own heart
[1:09:07] he will keep weakness in his heart
[1:09:13] it was not an hour move
[1:09:16] the move of God
[1:09:20] is God moving the heart of man
[1:09:24] back to his word
[1:09:30] if God breaks your heart
[1:09:32] and say this thing you are doing is is
[1:09:35] not according to the word of God you
[1:09:37] better take that as the voice of God
[1:09:40] don't say I will thank you you don't
[1:09:43] think right
[1:09:46] you better take that as the mercy of God
[1:09:48] and do what the word of God says do what
[1:09:51] you know is right according to the word
[1:09:54] of God not according to your feelings
[1:10:02] um very good because after you have
[1:10:05] struggled against it
[1:10:07] you struggle and make your choice to do
[1:10:10] whatever you want to do there will be a
[1:10:12] time you will never hear that voice
[1:10:14] again
[1:10:17] there will be nothing to break your
[1:10:19] conscience
[1:10:20] you will do things
[1:10:24] and that's the thing that we are seeing
[1:10:26] around the message
[1:10:27] people doing things
[1:10:33] that don't move they are conscious
[1:10:39] when they don't have no ground on the
[1:10:41] word of God that back what they are
[1:10:43] doing
[1:10:51] Lord
[1:10:55] but there was a little boy
[1:10:58] that was born to a coal mine family
[1:11:03] and he saw how his dad struggled
[1:11:07] and struggle
[1:11:09] struggle with the workers you know
[1:11:12] working Union and you know all of that
[1:11:18] and Martin taught
[1:11:20] that when he grew up he don't want to be
[1:11:23] a coal miner
[1:11:25] he want to be a lawyer
[1:11:29] you want to go to school and learn to be
[1:11:31] a lawyer
[1:11:32] so he can he can be able to Define
[1:11:34] defend his daddy's business
[1:11:38] he went to school
[1:11:40] and God bless
[1:11:42] the intention that he had on his heart
[1:11:47] and then
[1:11:49] uh
[1:11:53] it was one night
[1:11:56] there came a storm
[1:11:58] that he have never been able to explain
[1:12:05] you have never really been able to
[1:12:07] explain
[1:12:09] it was it was a stormy night with
[1:12:12] tundles and stormy was he was in here uh
[1:12:15] I think in a college traveling from the
[1:12:17] dorm and and it just looks like that
[1:12:20] storm was just for him
[1:12:23] and he never thought that he would make
[1:12:25] it to the Dom
[1:12:27] and he cried out
[1:12:29] and say oh God if you save me and I
[1:12:31] become a monk
[1:12:36] and among those days where the people
[1:12:39] those were the people that were though
[1:12:41] those devoted Catholics
[1:12:48] that's how he cried out
[1:12:50] say oh God if you save me
[1:12:55] and he kept his word
[1:12:58] that was one of the first Supernatural
[1:13:00] things in his life
[1:13:03] so brother Brown talking about a voice
[1:13:05] talking to him in the word in in the
[1:13:07] bush as a as a little boy saying don't
[1:13:10] smoke Don't drink don't defy your body
[1:13:13] because I haven't worked for you it was
[1:13:15] it was not unique to blood branding
[1:13:18] every messenger of the age Paul had his
[1:13:21] own on the road of Damascus the man
[1:13:23] around him never heard the voice
[1:13:27] praise the Lord but they saw the effect
[1:13:29] because he was blind
[1:13:32] after he was looking for help for people
[1:13:34] to lead him
[1:13:37] so little how this strange experience
[1:13:40] and right after that the storm sees
[1:13:45] and that's how
[1:13:47] he changed his course of life
[1:13:52] from a lawyer
[1:13:54] to become a monk
[1:13:57] and because he was a man of
[1:14:00] of such a zeal impassion
[1:14:04] he was always aiming for the top
[1:14:09] so he started taking his uh his
[1:14:12] relationship with God in a very in a
[1:14:15] very you know because this this monk are
[1:14:20] just like the Catholic norms
[1:14:23] yeah they are the people you know uh
[1:14:25] they have different stages of none they
[1:14:27] have the ones that are the Black Veil
[1:14:29] those ones they they give themselves
[1:14:32] over to Thomas you know uh they would
[1:14:35] crawl on breaking grass battle they
[1:14:37] would I mean they would just give they
[1:14:39] would just reflect themselves
[1:14:41] thinking their their Desiring to to to
[1:14:44] please God
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:48] and uh it's it's written that even ludov
[1:14:53] will wait for some of the coldest night
[1:14:56] of winter
[1:14:57] he go and sleep outside
[1:15:00] without a blanket
[1:15:03] because he's trying to deal with the
[1:15:05] sinful nature
[1:15:10] he's trying to cry to God God deliver me
[1:15:13] from lust or God Deliver Me From Evil
[1:15:15] thought
[1:15:20] a kind of a sinful desire or lust or all
[1:15:23] of that they will reflect themself
[1:15:28] and he was in there for a couple of
[1:15:31] years and and you know Eve he decided to
[1:15:34] travel to Rome we have talked about
[1:15:37] their story that's where he met these
[1:15:39] people you know they told him to read
[1:15:43] the
[1:15:44] book of
[1:15:47] habaku
[1:15:51] where he came across their structure the
[1:15:54] judge Chalet by faith
[1:15:56] and it started ringing in his head it
[1:15:58] started ringing in his head he started
[1:16:01] ringing in his head and when he got to
[1:16:03] Rome he was disappointed
[1:16:05] when he's the things that he saw there
[1:16:09] is this young man trying to live a life
[1:16:12] of devotion he got to Rome that should
[1:16:14] be the holy city
[1:16:17] he made a life of felt
[1:16:20] among the priests and the norms and all
[1:16:23] of those people he was so disappointed
[1:16:29] he decided to come back
[1:16:32] to Germany and God started dealing with
[1:16:34] him God started dealing with his heart
[1:16:39] kept bringing him in his mind
[1:16:41] until he took his Bible
[1:16:46] he decided to take the Holy Bible
[1:16:50] you know you have to realize you know
[1:16:53] all of that time they are instructed by
[1:16:55] the church you know to to follow what
[1:16:57] the church is don't follow what the
[1:16:59] Bible says follow what the church says
[1:17:02] and right there God started to deal with
[1:17:05] him
[1:17:07] he got in the Book of Romans
[1:17:11] the Holy Ghost just got a hold of him
[1:17:17] and started opening the pages of the
[1:17:19] scripture to his understanding
[1:17:21] something completely completely
[1:17:23] different from the church
[1:17:25] wow
[1:17:27] man Luther's God I mean he got he got a
[1:17:31] holy index nation in him
[1:17:35] a holy wrath was burning in his heart
[1:17:40] he said this thing is now going to be
[1:17:41] mine
[1:17:43] I'm going to write all of these things
[1:17:46] expose the church
[1:17:49] you're having people paying for their
[1:17:51] soul the scripture says this you are you
[1:17:53] are doing this the scripture says this
[1:17:55] you are you are saying sir the Bible
[1:17:56] says call no man father you I mean he
[1:17:58] wrote all of those things down
[1:18:02] praise the Lord I think brother Jordan I
[1:18:04] have a picture of the 95 thesis in one
[1:18:07] of my things there
[1:18:09] let's let's show there I'm getting ahead
[1:18:12] of myself so this this was this was how
[1:18:16] the 95 pieces were
[1:18:19] hmm
[1:18:21] he sent it over to the bishop of the
[1:18:23] church a copy and he took this copy and
[1:18:28] put it right on the All Saints Church
[1:18:30] door
[1:18:34] praise the Lord
[1:18:35] now you think about it those days people
[1:18:37] never have phone to to take picture
[1:18:39] quickly and say let me snatch it they
[1:18:41] were writing
[1:18:47] and this thing took place just in the
[1:18:49] time when the printing press was birthed
[1:18:55] you see how God moved right in a time
[1:18:57] when the printing press
[1:19:00] when they have just developed the
[1:19:02] printing press
[1:19:06] right there people started making copies
[1:19:08] before you realize it was widespread
[1:19:11] went over
[1:19:13] the borders
[1:19:17] of the Reformation started
[1:19:26] praise the Lord
[1:19:28] so why I was thinking on the air
[1:19:31] I taught on
[1:19:35] one of the songs that Ludo wrote
[1:19:39] Mighty Fortress
[1:19:43] praise the Lord
[1:19:46] so I was listening to uh I was listening
[1:19:49] to the song
[1:19:51] and I was listening to a piece that was
[1:19:54] playing on the on the violin so I said
[1:19:56] well okay I will call the uh
[1:19:59] joy and Becky
[1:20:01] and ask them to do a special
[1:20:04] so they would play there
[1:20:08] I told him to to tell sister Naomi
[1:20:12] and so they can play
[1:20:14] something on the violin of Mighty
[1:20:17] Fortress
[1:20:18] and then we will go into this the
[1:20:21] service December has already started so

[1:22:44] little mind
[1:22:46] when he was writing that song
[1:22:50] the artist our Mighty Fortress
[1:22:54] praise the Lord
[1:22:56] he knew his life was hanging in the
[1:22:58] balance
[1:23:01] he knew that uh
[1:23:04] this was not something that was going to
[1:23:06] be
[1:23:08] greatly embrace
[1:23:11] by the word
[1:23:14] and I was thinking brother Benham shared
[1:23:16] that in the seals he said every time I
[1:23:18] see you open
[1:23:19] he said the seal declared a war
[1:23:28] and the seal what is the seal he says
[1:23:30] Christ revealing his own word he said
[1:23:33] the seal is Christ
[1:23:34] he says whenever Christ is make known to
[1:23:37] the people
[1:23:39] and Christ is the word
[1:23:44] amen
[1:24:02] oh
[1:24:14] just like I said I'm kind of for cutting

[1:25:26] Lord and the Lord
[1:25:28] answer him net neither by dreams none by
[1:25:32] urine none by Prophets
[1:25:37] then said did I say Samia
[1:25:41] that's all sorry
[1:25:44] so something in the back of my head was
[1:25:46] telling me
[1:25:48] you that is you said something wrong
[1:25:52] and when Saul inquired of the Lord
[1:25:56] and the Lord answered him that
[1:26:00] neither by dreams known by urine known
[1:26:03] by the prophets now I caught myself
[1:26:06] because I was about to say because
[1:26:08] Samuel the prophet had died then you

[1:26:21] woman

[1:28:51] you portion of mine but let me tell you
[1:28:54] where I get mine uh the name of mine the
[1:28:57] title of my my message today
[1:29:01] and recognizing your dead in this
[1:29:03] message I want to read uh uh something
[1:29:06] here remember the vision of
[1:29:10] of last week that's who that's when the
[1:29:14] bride
[1:29:16] comes
[1:29:18] to preview of faith
[1:29:21] there came
[1:29:23] they came up
[1:29:26] the little bride lovely in the vision
[1:29:30] not thinking about it just sitting there
[1:29:33] watching outside and there
[1:29:38] there came the bride and I heard by the
[1:29:43] voice of me saying
[1:29:47] year is a preview
[1:29:52] of the Bride
[1:29:53] and she came by and I noticed her
[1:29:57] the way she was very lovely pretty young
[1:30:02] she was walking just
[1:30:05] the step as she could
[1:30:08] not a match
[1:30:10] amen
[1:30:13] now I I was thinking about this last
[1:30:15] week we we uh we show uh Israel India
[1:30:21] match
[1:30:22] the formation of Israel India match amen
[1:30:25] all the tribes uh
[1:30:29] free on each side
[1:30:31] Judah was the one that was leading from
[1:30:34] the East Israel always traveled to the
[1:30:37] by the way of the East
[1:30:39] and and then the rest of the tribes were
[1:30:42] in their position the North and the
[1:30:43] South and the west and they were in
[1:30:46] their position now as Israel traveled
[1:30:50] that way praise the Lord now if if you
[1:30:53] are on the ground and and the Ark of the
[1:30:56] Covenant is is in the midst you will not
[1:30:59] you will not see it like the way we show
[1:31:02] it like someone in the air you know then
[1:31:05] you will see that projection of the
[1:31:07] cross
[1:31:08] you know so uh uh as Israel make their
[1:31:13] travel you we have to realize that uh
[1:31:16] they they then that they were all taught
[1:31:20] to stay in their
[1:31:23] place of position
[1:31:27] praise the Lord
[1:31:29] they move the eye can see in the middle
[1:31:31] every try move they move they move they
[1:31:34] are not they are not joining and mixing
[1:31:36] and uh no they just move like that they
[1:31:39] have to stay in their place now I was
[1:31:42] thinking about that when I was thinking
[1:31:43] about the preview of the Bride uh what
[1:31:46] I'm what I'm reading to you here and uh
[1:31:49] uh
[1:31:51] to for us to see why uh
[1:31:56] the prophet had to cry in the vision
[1:32:00] stay in line
[1:32:03] amen why he had to cry in in Vision when
[1:32:07] he saw the bride getting out of step and
[1:32:10] as he married and narrated in a vision a
[1:32:13] masterpiece you were you would see that
[1:32:16] he he he says every you know every
[1:32:18] nation you know what they were dressed
[1:32:20] the way the word and and all of that but
[1:32:23] the important thing there is there that
[1:32:25] I wanted to bring out was uh for them to
[1:32:29] for him to cry out in a vision stay in
[1:32:32] line the importance of staying in the
[1:32:35] matching other the Martian order of the
[1:32:38] church is the word of God Amen the first
[1:32:42] step like this Ahmed was said left right
[1:32:44] the first step is repent and be baptized
[1:32:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:49] amen praise the Lord that's the first
[1:32:52] step that's the first step of the
[1:32:54] Martian order repent and be baptized in
[1:32:57] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:32:58] the remission of your sin if you want to
[1:33:00] get in this match that is the way to
[1:33:02] start amen so you see uh just like how
[1:33:06] Israel had a martian order they had to
[1:33:09] keep the act of the Covenant in the
[1:33:11] middle the church also have a matching
[1:33:14] order amen that's why we can go on our
[1:33:17] own ideas we can do like other churches
[1:33:19] we want to do why can't we do this uh uh
[1:33:22] a birthday party do Halloween party and
[1:33:25] do all of these things and and and and
[1:33:27] you know and Bongo games for for money
[1:33:30] raising that's that's not if the church
[1:33:32] ever do that we are Marching out of
[1:33:34] order amen
[1:33:37] the Martian order of the church is the
[1:33:40] word of God
[1:33:44] you don't know your life in right until
[1:33:47] you are
[1:33:48] about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:50] Hallelujah
[1:33:52] you know how to throw a salute
[1:33:57] you don't go to theological school to
[1:34:00] know how to throw a salute when it comes
[1:34:02] to this Army
[1:34:04] you have to get down to that pool and be
[1:34:06] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:08] Christ when you get up then you know
[1:34:11] what is right
[1:34:12] and left praise the Lord if you were not
[1:34:16] just a dry sinner that needed to be a
[1:34:18] wet one
[1:34:20] amen
[1:34:21] come anytime dry Cena become a wet one
[1:34:24] and they come up with the same nature
[1:34:25] the same attitude but if you are dead
[1:34:30] and bear it
[1:34:31] you resurrect in the image of Christ
[1:34:35] are we together

[1:34:40] Bride he's talking here this bride
[1:34:42] coming she's looking pretty she's
[1:34:44] walking just in the step as she could

[1:34:54] walking coming to my left on this side
[1:34:58] and she went out of my sight then I
[1:35:03] turned to uh uh then he turned me to the
[1:35:07] right side and he showed me
[1:35:10] each church as they come
[1:35:15] up out of the ages oh how vocal and he
[1:35:21] says and the last one was this last day
[1:35:25] Church age which was led by a witch

[1:36:38] now we read that in first time here to
[1:36:42] show how the choice of the people when
[1:36:45] they rejected Samuel as a king and
[1:36:47] choose uh Samuel as a prophet and true
[1:36:51] sword as a king now the choice of the
[1:36:54] people have run into crisis
[1:36:57] right amen he could only follow the word
[1:37:01] of God as as much as he can
[1:37:07] now he has run into crisis
[1:37:10] he has to make
[1:37:12] an option
[1:37:16] praise the Lord
[1:37:18] Hallelujah
[1:37:22] and
[1:37:23] we see here because he will not listen
[1:37:27] to the prophet
[1:37:30] Samir
[1:37:33] he was always trying to appeal to the
[1:37:37] feelings of the people
[1:37:40] he won't listen to The Prophet Samia
[1:37:44] Samia told him God has rented your
[1:37:48] kingdom
[1:37:49] just the same way that you have rented
[1:37:51] my skirt because he told the Garment of
[1:37:54] Samuel
[1:37:58] the Lord has rejected you
[1:38:02] let's go to a first Samuel chapter 15.
[1:38:05] that's where this conversation was first
[1:38:07] Samuel chapter 15.
[1:38:11] first Samuel chapter 15.
[1:38:20] praise the Lord are we together
[1:38:29] first Samuel chapter 15 verse 22 Samuel
[1:38:33] said have the Lord has great Delight in
[1:38:37] burnt offering and sacrifice as in
[1:38:40] obeying the voice of the Lord
[1:38:43] behold to obey
[1:38:45] is better than sacrifice
[1:38:48] and to hacking then the facts of RAM
[1:38:53] for Rebellion
[1:38:55] for Rebellion to rebel against God's
[1:38:59] word
[1:39:00] is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:39:08] praise the Lord
[1:39:15] any form of rebellion against God's word
[1:39:18] it is just as the sin of Witchcraft in
[1:39:22] in Israel we'll get back that I will get
[1:39:25] back there like like I just said I have
[1:39:27] my hands full this morning you will
[1:39:30] realize like I said on Wednesday night
[1:39:32] when Moses came down there to to uh to
[1:39:36] Egypt and he throw his serpent down uh
[1:39:40] uh Pharaoh called his magician and says
[1:39:43] my boys can do the same they did the
[1:39:45] same thing the next plague that Moses
[1:39:48] brought out they did the same thing
[1:39:51] praise the Lord read your scripture the
[1:39:54] next plague that Moses brought out they
[1:39:57] did the same thing
[1:40:00] until the fourth plague
[1:40:05] praise the Lord
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:10] and then you said they said to Pharaoh
[1:40:12] they said this one
[1:40:14] is the Finger of God
[1:40:25] they said this one
[1:40:27] is the finger
[1:40:36] praise the Lord
[1:40:38] now so
[1:40:40] this thing you will you will realize you
[1:40:42] go over to Exodus chapter 20. you will
[1:40:46] realize
[1:40:47] that
[1:40:51] Magic
[1:40:57] uh uh uh all of these uh
[1:41:01] mysterious things witchcraft things
[1:41:04] there were things that were very common
[1:41:07] in Egypt
[1:41:10] it was a kingdom where the people
[1:41:12] learned to exercise power and a way to
[1:41:16] show yourself Superior over another
[1:41:18] person you have to either bring out a
[1:41:21] trick or you got to be under some kind
[1:41:23] of a diva Nation
[1:41:26] right
[1:41:28] that was the way that the Egyptian knew
[1:41:31] how to to to subject their friends
[1:41:35] so when Moses came throwing his his uh
[1:41:39] stick down they told that oh you're not
[1:41:42] going to Humble Us by this
[1:41:45] you're not going to Humble Us by this
[1:41:52] praise the Lord
[1:41:58] are we together so it was just a common
[1:42:01] thing it's a common thing uh uh uh with
[1:42:05] the Egyptians and it's a common thing
[1:42:07] that I was looking at uh the the
[1:42:11] statistics last night to just uh uh see
[1:42:15] uh uh
[1:42:17] uh how
[1:42:19] you know all of these divination and
[1:42:22] Witchcraft thing it is in the society
[1:42:25] that we live today it it just it's just
[1:42:29] a way that people try to exercise being
[1:42:32] Superior over another person
[1:42:37] and it doesn't tell them they are well
[1:42:39] there is something that I know that you
[1:42:40] don't know
[1:42:43] praise the Lord
[1:42:45] amen
[1:42:47] and I mean it's just it's just all over
[1:42:49] the word
[1:42:52] back home travel uh just a few years
[1:42:55] come back uh you know uh uh you find all
[1:42:58] of the young boys out of out of
[1:43:01] University they are all going into the
[1:43:03] Masonic craft
[1:43:06] they are all trying to measure power
[1:43:12] they want to be at state level
[1:43:19] are we together
[1:43:23] and also
[1:43:26] all of these things are things that are
[1:43:29] coming to the to the Egyptians so you
[1:43:32] will realize that
[1:43:35] God told the children of Israel in
[1:43:38] Exodus chapter 20 as he was laying out
[1:43:41] the the Commandments
[1:43:44] he warned him and told them
[1:43:48] that there should be no witch
[1:43:51] that should live among you
[1:43:55] there was a reason for that
[1:43:58] to come to that
[1:44:00] as we as we travel
[1:44:03] so
[1:44:04] uh uh uh the the practice of uh of
[1:44:09] waiting Necromancer and all of that it
[1:44:12] was a kind of a capital punishment in
[1:44:14] Israel
[1:44:16] when a person was found doing that
[1:44:19] yeah because the reason is because
[1:44:23] the god of Israel was the supernatural
[1:44:25] God
[1:44:26] and he was among his people
[1:44:30] he was not a God that was far off
[1:44:33] amen
[1:44:34] that's that's the reason why we spoke
[1:44:36] about the shout what was war was
[1:44:38] creating a shout in the camp of Israel
[1:44:41] was the manifestation of God in a camp
[1:44:46] so God never wanted another mystical
[1:44:49] power to be among his people
[1:44:51] no he wanted his power because he knows
[1:44:56] there was nothing that he could not do
[1:45:00] thank you
[1:45:05] praise the Lord if the people need God
[1:45:08] they just need to call upon him he's a
[1:45:12] present help in time of trouble
[1:45:18] are we together
[1:45:23] or break a rock or stress Iraq
[1:45:28] or spring got some blood around the
[1:45:30] house all they needed to do was just
[1:45:32] call upon God
[1:45:38] so God frown against that
[1:45:42] from the games the people Consulting any
[1:45:45] Spirit beside the Holy Ghost
[1:45:54] are we together
[1:45:56] oh this is Halloween Eve
[1:45:59] we will have our party Halloween Eve
[1:46:02] before the witches can get out
[1:46:04] we going to put the blood on the door of
[1:46:07] the lane tail before the witches can get
[1:46:09] out
[1:46:10] [Applause]
[1:46:18] glory be to God
[1:46:20] God is God and the God we serve he's a
[1:46:24] living God he's not a dead God he lives
[1:46:28] among his people
[1:46:31] he said God that do yeah he said God
[1:46:34] that can speak he's the one that rocked
[1:46:37] on the world of Babylon he's a God that
[1:46:40] moves among his people he's a living God
[1:46:44] foreign
[1:46:51] he said God that can save he can deliver
[1:46:54] he said God that can heal
[1:46:58] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:47:01] even if it's a two egg we bring a prayer
[1:47:03] request if it's a stretching hair we
[1:47:05] bring a prayer request because we know
[1:47:07] our God can heal
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:16] praise the Lord oh maybe you have not
[1:47:19] experienced God yet maybe you have not
[1:47:21] experienced him yet you have just known
[1:47:24] him in the name of a church know him as
[1:47:27] a religious God but I'm talking about a
[1:47:29] living God the that lives among his
[1:47:31] people
[1:47:41] praise the Lord
[1:47:43] so it was a capital punishment
[1:47:46] it was one thing that God detested among
[1:47:50] his people
[1:47:53] truth of the matter is
[1:47:55] those things
[1:47:57] already been
[1:48:00] among the Hebrews
[1:48:04] um
[1:48:05] they have been attracted to those things
[1:48:07] you you have to realize this is a these
[1:48:10] are people that they were not just there
[1:48:13] for five years
[1:48:15] all of these Quran and Dayton they were
[1:48:17] all born in Egypt
[1:48:21] Jacob only came with his sons
[1:48:24] and their wives
[1:48:28] all of these people they were born right
[1:48:30] there in Egypt they went to Egyptian
[1:48:32] schools
[1:48:34] praise the Lord
[1:48:36] the same way that our educational system
[1:48:38] now is trying to teach honor as children
[1:48:42] about sex and all of that that is the
[1:48:44] same way this polluted Egyptian system
[1:48:46] was they taught their magic in school
[1:48:50] they didn't know anything about God
[1:48:55] they taught them about the idols
[1:48:59] if this thing is happening to you go to
[1:49:01] the river and do that that was what they
[1:49:02] taught them
[1:49:04] thank you oh my God yep
[1:49:10] so a generation that grew up the Bible's
[1:49:13] talked about a pharaoh that knew not
[1:49:15] Joseph but there was a generation of
[1:49:18] Hebrews that never knew God
[1:49:21] they were all exposed to the Egyptian
[1:49:23] wisdom
[1:49:27] don't look at the story from one side
[1:49:30] because there is always two sides to a
[1:49:33] queen no matter how thin you slice it
[1:49:37] so it was not only a pharaoh that did
[1:49:40] not know Joseph
[1:49:41] there was a people that did not know
[1:49:43] their God
[1:49:44] they don't even knew the meaning of
[1:49:46] their names
[1:49:48] instead of looking into the Hebrew a
[1:49:51] dictionary they were defining their
[1:49:53] names by the Egyptian dictionary
[1:50:03] praise the Lord
[1:50:05] you talking about a generation around
[1:50:08] this message that I don't know nothing
[1:50:09] about a prophet all they have heard
[1:50:11] about is what preachers have said and
[1:50:13] now they are confused
[1:50:15] yeah
[1:50:18] yeah praise the lord we are not far away
[1:50:21] it's just about taking 14 hours from
[1:50:24] Jeffersonville
[1:50:26] praise the Lord
[1:50:28] how many times brother Brown came true
[1:50:30] he had a Minneapolis to God in Peterson
[1:50:34] In This Very City
[1:50:36] not too far from that from the whole
[1:50:38] from the airport uh uh the Ramada Inn
[1:50:41] they just broke it down I learned more
[1:50:43] of America about that place it was right
[1:50:45] in that hotel whatever Brahm got the
[1:50:47] vision about Joseph having a son by the
[1:50:49] name of Joseph he said when I was in
[1:50:51] Minneapolis
[1:50:53] by the Ramada Inn
[1:51:00] what are we talking about
[1:51:02] these were not things that were done
[1:51:04] with Dawn under behind the curtains
[1:51:12] over over one thousand plus tapes things
[1:51:15] have been said over and over
[1:51:18] and let me tell you
[1:51:21] this country has
[1:51:23] in order of his weakness a state has a
[1:51:26] good defense system
[1:51:28] praise the Lord amen a security system
[1:51:32] is very good even right in real right
[1:51:34] now when I was in Liberia the U.S
[1:51:36] government helped to track a a ship that
[1:51:40] was taking drugs to Liberia
[1:51:45] it was coming from South America going
[1:51:47] to Liberia to come back to South America
[1:51:50] and they arrested that shape in life and
[1:51:53] we helped them it was the U.S government
[1:51:54] it was the airbn
[1:51:58] praise the Lord
[1:52:01] so I just I just sat there to tell you
[1:52:04] that if brother Branham was deceiving
[1:52:06] the American public the FBI would have
[1:52:10] picked him up
[1:52:15] if there was something on of his sleeves
[1:52:20] praise the Lord right now the the the
[1:52:23] the the Latter Day Saints over in Utah
[1:52:26] they are having a case with the FBA
[1:52:28] because of all the the all the the the
[1:52:32] the
[1:52:33] ugly things that have been happening in
[1:52:34] the group
[1:52:41] that's not the only group of people even
[1:52:44] the Watchtower
[1:52:49] praise the Lord
[1:52:51] said I'm better than that sit straight
[1:52:55] are we together
[1:52:57] oh I'm just I'm just trying to wake you
[1:52:59] up a little bit
[1:53:01] that these are not calling device people
[1:53:04] we are not saying things to play on your
[1:53:06] mind
[1:53:08] amen it's not to get your mind is to get
[1:53:11] your soul
[1:53:13] thank you
[1:53:16] so the word of God can have a place to
[1:53:19] grow
[1:53:32] so Saul will not listen to Sam your
[1:53:34] advice you will not take instruction
[1:53:38] and because of that God will not speak
[1:53:41] to him anymore
[1:53:44] praise the Lord
[1:53:46] he will hear from the Lord anymore
[1:53:50] the uretry mean that was a
[1:53:52] representation of the word of God he
[1:53:54] will go to the Bible and you will read
[1:53:56] and nothing will make sense
[1:54:00] and nothing will make sense
[1:54:03] if the grace of God is helping you to
[1:54:06] read your Bible and something from the
[1:54:09] scripture can entrust you you better
[1:54:11] take that as the grace of God and may it
[1:54:14] make you humble
[1:54:17] may I humble you
[1:54:23] praise the Lord because there are people
[1:54:26] that are well educated in you wish that
[1:54:28] they can be able to pick up John 3 16
[1:54:30] for it to make sense to them
[1:54:34] right because when you read that verse
[1:54:36] God so loved the whole world how can God
[1:54:37] love the whole world and and there were
[1:54:39] war in Ukraine die alone back for them
[1:54:42] that alone makes them to close their
[1:54:44] Bible and they don't want to read it
[1:54:46] anymore
[1:54:47] but you can take up that bible and read
[1:54:49] God so loved the word and live for your
[1:54:51] hands say thank you Lord Jesus I see
[1:54:54] your love in my heart
[1:55:04] some of us we think we are smart
[1:55:12] don't worry
[1:55:15] God will help you
[1:55:18] praise the Lord so we see we see this uh
[1:55:22] uh this this move of God
[1:55:26] and here Samuel now that he can hear
[1:55:30] from God he's not having no spiritual
[1:55:32] dreams he's he's in trouble he's now
[1:55:35] going to find another medium
[1:55:40] praise the Lord
[1:55:41] well he didn't know how Google those
[1:55:44] days so he couldn't search on Google
[1:55:47] he didn't have Facebook to know what
[1:55:49] Facebook is doing
[1:55:51] the most smartest thing he had in the
[1:55:53] land was a wage
[1:55:55] praise the Lord
[1:55:57] amen
[1:55:58] Hallelujah
[1:56:00] depending on what you are using Siri for
[1:56:02] she could be a wish for you
[1:56:11] said alibra won't say Siri is a witch
[1:56:15] don't go and say that
[1:56:22] foreign
[1:56:26] but
[1:56:28] you will realize that when you go to the
[1:56:31] scripture when Sam your king or saw when
[1:56:35] he took over to be king
[1:56:37] this was one of the things that he
[1:56:40] impressed the People by
[1:56:43] getting rid of all of the witches
[1:56:49] he wanted to gain the favor of the
[1:56:51] people
[1:56:52] and also to show that the people have
[1:56:55] not rejected Samuel
[1:56:58] they just wanted a king
[1:57:01] for an addition
[1:57:04] praise the Lord
[1:57:06] so he's saying that he sent a campaign
[1:57:08] to get rid of all of the people that was
[1:57:11] practicing which in the land get rid of
[1:57:13] them
[1:57:16] praise the Lord
[1:57:18] but now that he's in need
[1:57:23] glory be to God
[1:57:24] you know what this tell me it tells me
[1:57:27] that this was not Samuel I mean so our
[1:57:29] first time looking for the witch
[1:57:33] the reason that is because we always
[1:57:35] keep
[1:57:36] the Bible says
[1:57:38] where your heart is
[1:57:41] where your treasure will be
[1:57:45] we just keep it in a treasure place for
[1:57:48] the day of need
[1:57:50] you say Lord Deliver Me Lord deliver me
[1:57:53] but you are just keep in the day
[1:57:55] keeping it in
[1:57:58] now if this thing does not work go back
[1:58:00] to that
[1:58:06] praise the Lord
[1:58:08] amen
[1:58:10] Elisha had nothing to go back to because
[1:58:13] what he broke them and he breaks
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:18] he had nothing to do to go back to
[1:58:19] because he burned it
[1:58:25] praise the Lord
[1:58:27] he killed his ox
[1:58:30] broke all his tools and burned it as an
[1:58:32] offering to God
[1:58:37] praise the Lord
[1:58:40] in the book of Acts that was what they
[1:58:42] did
[1:58:43] the bro they brought all the mystical
[1:58:45] books and everything over to the feet of
[1:58:48] the Apostles they say bring them
[1:58:53] and that's what the Holy Ghost would do
[1:58:56] to you
[1:58:57] amen
[1:58:59] he knows that you are still living in a
[1:59:01] word
[1:59:02] where you have all of this attractions
[1:59:04] to what he does he comes and burned the
[1:59:06] desire
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:09] he burns the desire
[1:59:12] amen
[1:59:13] you look at it oh I used to love that
[1:59:15] thing but there's no desire to go back
[1:59:20] oh praise the Lord
[1:59:22] Hallelujah you love the Lord oh let's
[1:59:26] give the Lord a hand of Praise
[1:59:27] Hallelujah
[1:59:29] foreign
[1:59:35] thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen
[1:59:41] thank you Jesus now so we see you we see
[1:59:47] here that uh uh uh uh
[1:59:52] Samir is telling Saul
[1:59:55] for Rebellion is as a scene of
[1:59:58] witchcraft
[2:00:00] in stubbornness as a knowledge as
[2:00:03] iniquity in adultery now so Samir
[2:00:08] being the prophet he's identifying
[2:00:10] something
[2:00:12] in Saul already now if you look at this
[2:00:15] thing that Samir is saying to Saul
[2:00:19] you will not be surprised that he end up
[2:00:21] at the faith of which
[2:00:24] because Samia is saying the spirit of
[2:00:27] rebellion in you
[2:00:30] that make you no instruction I gave you
[2:00:33] you take
[2:00:37] praise the Lord
[2:00:41] is the spirit of witchcraft
[2:00:44] so I mean witchcraft just go to
[2:00:47] witchcraft
[2:00:50] praise the Lord amen yeah witchcraft
[2:00:52] just go to witchcraft
[2:00:55] is that spirit that led him to find a
[2:00:57] solution there
[2:01:01] are we are we together
[2:01:05] praise the Lord
[2:01:12] so we are taking that that's that's
[2:01:14] where we're taking our inspiration from
[2:01:16] to show how how how how how in their
[2:01:20] Vision brother Branham is now saying
[2:01:22] that this last this church she's led by
[2:01:26] a witch
[2:01:28] amen so the concept before we go into
[2:01:31] into looking at the concept there is the
[2:01:34] other because the last this church has
[2:01:37] left the word of God

[2:01:44] bring Miracles and bring healing and
[2:01:47] bring it she's looking for all sorts of
[2:01:50] things and they'll knock the people hell
[2:01:51] let them be slayed under the spirit
[2:01:54] under the spirit in the morning service
[2:01:56] in the evening to go right back to their
[2:01:58] clubs and the drink and the dance and
[2:02:01] they mess themselves around and come
[2:02:03] back to be slay the next service
[2:02:07] praise the Lord
[2:02:10] amen are we together
[2:02:16] now so you we we see all of these things
[2:02:22] we see all of these things
[2:02:26] that's the position of the age that we
[2:02:29] are living
[2:02:33] even with the with the society that we
[2:02:35] have that have kicked the Bible out of
[2:02:37] schools
[2:02:38] no no matter what no no wonder why they
[2:02:41] are resolving to all of these things
[2:02:45] praise the Lord
[2:02:51] I've just I was just following some news
[2:02:53] for you last night and and saw that you
[2:02:55] know uh I mean uh those people that in
[2:02:59] South Korea could lost their life 150
[2:03:02] people it's even more than that yeah
[2:03:04] because there were a lot of casualty
[2:03:07] on the Halloween party
[2:03:12] praise the Lord
[2:03:17] now so as we as we look at this
[2:03:24] we were
[2:03:28] glory be to God
[2:03:35] let's let's let's go back a little bit
[2:03:37] here uh brother Jordan if you go back to
[2:03:40] my to my slice there let's let's look at
[2:03:43] this I'm I'm just I'm just all caught up
[2:03:47] here and there but I found my way out
[2:03:50] here soon let's go back let's look at
[2:03:52] the root of Halloween
[2:03:55] the roots of Halloween yeah it
[2:03:57] originated
[2:03:59] its origin
[2:04:02] Asian Brighton and Ireland
[2:04:05] it was aesthetic Festival
[2:04:08] saham God that's the god of the Dead
[2:04:11] just just shut this light off for me
[2:04:13] back there for the journey
[2:04:15] so he can help the people to see
[2:04:21] it was reserved
[2:04:26] the evening of October 31st
[2:04:30] follow
[2:04:32] November 1st
[2:04:34] praise the Lord
[2:04:36] amen
[2:04:40] and one time before we have uh we before
[2:04:43] we had our January 1st
[2:04:46] as the new year
[2:04:49] November 1st was a new year
[2:04:54] praise the Lord
[2:04:55] so you see the same connection
[2:04:58] of this of this uh of this Asian
[2:05:03] devilish feasts that was on on October
[2:05:07] 31st
[2:05:10] which was a New Year Eve
[2:05:13] is the Same Spirit
[2:05:16] that gets on December 31st
[2:05:19] you see the date has changed but the
[2:05:21] spirit is still there
[2:05:26] praise the Lord amen so you see yeah uh
[2:05:30] uh that's that's where the the you know
[2:05:33] these people that are giving are the the
[2:05:34] statistics of uh Halloween being the the
[2:05:38] the the the Ted
[2:05:40] uh popular party activity
[2:05:44] you know after
[2:05:46] uh
[2:05:49] uh New Year Eve
[2:05:51] the first and Super Bowl the second uh
[2:05:56] Halloween the place there as the third
[2:06:01] let's go to the next now now so this
[2:06:05] celt they were you know came from the
[2:06:08] drones that practice their practice
[2:06:10] believed they believe in reincarnation
[2:06:14] transmigration of Souls human can be
[2:06:18] reborn as animals
[2:06:20] you know that's a common thing that they
[2:06:22] believe and we see that that's the same
[2:06:25] thing that the Hindu believe
[2:06:28] praise the Lord
[2:06:32] amen
[2:06:33] now you see people will will believe all
[2:06:36] of these things and yet they will
[2:06:38] struggle with the serpent seed of
[2:06:40] Genesis chapter 3.
[2:06:43] they will believe that humans can die
[2:06:46] and become animals
[2:06:48] but yet they will struggle with the
[2:06:51] truth of Genesis chapter 3.
[2:06:55] that the serpent was not ereptide he was
[2:06:58] a man
[2:07:00] because God says from this day on your
[2:07:02] base on your belly you will go and thus
[2:07:04] you will eat the curse was the one that
[2:07:06] deformed him
[2:07:13] they won't struggle with reincarnation
[2:07:16] and all of that
[2:07:22] no I was I was I was somebody was kind
[2:07:24] of pushing the thought of the
[2:07:26] Netherlands and nephilims in Genesis 6
[2:07:28] and nephilims
[2:07:30] and that's that's what I got that
[2:07:32] thought from us as this God is trying to
[2:07:34] prove you know that Angels came down and
[2:07:39] and became human beings and went out
[2:07:41] with the with the daughters of men
[2:07:45] and yet he struggled
[2:07:48] with the serpency
[2:07:52] so you see unless God gives you a
[2:07:55] revelation
[2:07:57] unless God open your heart to believe
[2:08:00] the truth you might even stop with just
[2:08:03] acknowledge
[2:08:04] because it don't stop there
[2:08:06] right
[2:08:08] praise the Lord let's let's go forward
[2:08:11] let's go forward
[2:08:14] these cells they engage you know in
[2:08:18] occult's arts and worship nature the
[2:08:21] Jews they were Priestly class the I
[2:08:23] believe in practices are uh show uh very
[2:08:28] same to the Hindus
[2:08:33] praise the Lord
[2:08:36] now I'm
[2:08:38] I'm having some confusion in my slides
[2:08:41] here but
[2:08:44] let's take October 1st
[2:08:58] so uh
[2:09:15] shhh
[2:09:16] October 1st
[2:09:19] uh it's the Asian fire Festival was set
[2:09:22] up to frighten away evil spirits
[2:09:26] The Souls of the Dead were said to visit
[2:09:28] their homes
[2:09:31] praise the Lord
[2:09:35] it was a festival acquired you know with
[2:09:38] the significance of ghosts and witching
[2:09:40] and black cats and fairies and demons in
[2:09:43] order there I'm just I'm just only
[2:09:45] bringing these things just to you know
[2:09:48] kind of forgive us uh uh I don't want to
[2:09:50] spend much of my time in this
[2:09:55] praise the Lord
[2:10:00] so it came from uh
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:04] uh Sahan which is the Lord of death
[2:10:07] he gathered The Souls of the Evil Dead
[2:10:10] that have been condemned to
[2:10:12] to enter the body of human I mean of
[2:10:15] animals and the source of the good there
[2:10:18] were reincarnated to humans
[2:10:20] as humans you know the Drew believes
[2:10:24] that that the punishment of the Evil
[2:10:27] Dead will be like uh lightened by
[2:10:30] sacrifice prayers and gifts
[2:10:33] to the Lord of death
[2:10:36] so the whole big thing behind this whole
[2:10:40] uh Halloween October 31st was just a big
[2:10:45] celebration tour you know the god of
[2:10:48] death
[2:10:50] the god of death
[2:10:59] but it was said that the early American
[2:11:03] in the early American history Halloween
[2:11:05] was now practice
[2:11:08] Halloween was now practiced because one
[2:11:11] of the reasons that is there when the
[2:11:13] early fathers came over they frowned
[2:11:15] against those things
[2:11:18] okay because they knew that it was it
[2:11:21] had a big significance to purgatory
[2:11:26] and Purgatory was one of the things that
[2:11:28] the Catholic Church used to to bankrupt
[2:11:31] the Europeans
[2:11:34] okay because if you're if you're far if
[2:11:36] your family have wealth they are going
[2:11:39] to make sure they are they use every
[2:11:41] money that is in that well for you to
[2:11:43] pay for your father or pay for your
[2:11:45] loved one that is gone
[2:11:47] that was how they use to to rob the
[2:11:50] people
[2:11:52] so the early fathers did not do that
[2:11:55] they did they never you know gave heed
[2:11:58] to that it was not a it became
[2:12:00] widespread in the 20th century it's a
[2:12:03] culture that came with the Irish
[2:12:05] Catholic immigrants
[2:12:08] they brought their
[2:12:10] because Halloween is a national holiday
[2:12:13] in Ireland
[2:12:21] praise the Lord
[2:12:24] are we together
[2:12:29] now they're having all of these things
[2:12:32] on why they do you know they do the
[2:12:36] traits you know trick-or-treats and all
[2:12:38] of that
[2:12:39] they have in all sorts of things like I
[2:12:42] said I don't want to spend much of my
[2:12:43] time on it the only reason why I'm
[2:12:46] bringing this is because uh you know uh
[2:12:48] tomorrow is Halloween
[2:12:51] and also to be able to show uh
[2:12:55] you know the kind of a society that we
[2:12:58] are living in
[2:13:00] you know and it's it's I mean it's not
[2:13:05] to scare you no if you are afraid you
[2:13:09] just have the spirit of fear on you you
[2:13:10] need to be prayful and I don't think I'm
[2:13:12] trying to scare you
[2:13:14] praise the Lord I mean things that
[2:13:17] people choose to do and and you know uh
[2:13:20] I mean that's that's your choice
[2:13:24] you know that is your choice I'm not I'm
[2:13:27] not trying to uh uh establish an
[2:13:30] anti-hollow Halloween movement
[2:13:35] praise the Lord
[2:13:37] it is because
[2:13:39] we are in a society
[2:13:41] word uh uh that that don't have the the
[2:13:46] history of these things
[2:13:48] and you find people that I ignorantly
[2:13:52] involving themselves in it
[2:13:55] praise the Lord amen you you have many
[2:13:59] many Church groups that try to do you
[2:14:02] know a special thing for Halloween you
[2:14:05] know well yeah we don't we don't want to
[2:14:07] be uh dressing in that you know and then
[2:14:09] we we can just uh form our own thing to
[2:14:13] substitute for Halloween
[2:14:15] praise the Lord
[2:14:17] but just like just like I said and
[2:14:20] watching that you know that God in the
[2:14:23] Supernatural way will will will begin a
[2:14:27] move
[2:14:28] you know will will
[2:14:31] right at that very same time like I said
[2:14:34] to me was that was the first nail in the
[2:14:37] devil's coughing
[2:14:39] amen
[2:14:41] that God will raise up
[2:14:47] uh a sincere young man
[2:14:51] that all he want to do is just to please
[2:14:54] God
[2:14:57] and he got enslaved by the church and
[2:15:00] all of his rules in all office and knew
[2:15:04] nothing about the grace of God
[2:15:06] oh
[2:15:08] that we talked about today the grace of
[2:15:10] God the grace of God
[2:15:13] praise the Lord
[2:15:16] what actually Luther saw was the grace
[2:15:19] of God
[2:15:21] what he saw he looked in a scripture and
[2:15:24] he realized
[2:15:26] that a woman caught in adultery was was
[2:15:29] born to the feet of Jesus
[2:15:33] the ones that they taught and that they
[2:15:35] were they taught in the Catholic church
[2:15:36] that we that that that they as monks and
[2:15:41] as none must measure up their life talk
[2:15:43] right
[2:15:47] praise the Lord
[2:15:52] hallelujah oh you don't know that
[2:15:56] the Catholic Talk Church teach that when
[2:15:59] a man has been gone able to go through
[2:16:02] all of his training
[2:16:04] and he has come to the place to be
[2:16:06] confirmed as a priest
[2:16:11] in the local assembly
[2:16:15] that area where he word that a chopper
[2:16:18] that is turned over to him
[2:16:21] he says to those people as the Lord
[2:16:24] Jesus
[2:16:27] oh you don't know that
[2:16:30] Heat that he's giving the power
[2:16:34] to be able to take that that whiffer
[2:16:38] your little bread
[2:16:40] he's giving the power
[2:16:43] to be able to take that little bread
[2:16:47] and turn it to the body of the Lord
[2:16:49] Jesus
[2:16:52] now because Jesus turned water into wine
[2:16:56] that was his first miracle
[2:17:03] so that would be the first miracle a
[2:17:06] priest
[2:17:07] that has been ordained
[2:17:09] his first miracle will be able to hold
[2:17:11] that that uh glass in his hands
[2:17:15] and say the Latin ritual
[2:17:20] is being in power that your first
[2:17:23] miracle is to turn this wine
[2:17:27] into the blood the Electoral blood of
[2:17:30] the Lord Jesus
[2:17:33] and because of the power that is
[2:17:36] invested in them
[2:17:37] by the church
[2:17:40] a priest can abuse a woman that is
[2:17:44] married
[2:17:45] and she have no right to tell her
[2:17:48] husband
[2:17:49] because she's forgiving
[2:17:53] so you see the perverse that is in the
[2:17:56] church
[2:17:58] you see the evil that is upon the people
[2:18:07] how they will come to their confession
[2:18:09] boxes
[2:18:11] and they will pollute the minds of
[2:18:13] innocent girls
[2:18:15] they will abuse their minds
[2:18:22] just from a young age
[2:18:30] praise the Lord
[2:18:35] now if you don't know these things then
[2:18:38] you can sit around
[2:18:40] and allow it to happen
[2:18:43] in the churches Where You Are
[2:18:45] with some of us that know these things
[2:18:51] we don't lose a lot of sleep
[2:18:56] praise the Lord
[2:18:59] we were hindering a situation
[2:19:02] and his brother
[2:19:04] was trying to force us to do something
[2:19:07] I told him I says
[2:19:10] I said we're not going to do it
[2:19:14] I don't I don't want to go into the
[2:19:16] details it's not edifying
[2:19:19] you know it's not edifying so I'm not
[2:19:21] going to go into the details if you want
[2:19:22] to know come meet me in my office
[2:19:25] praise the Lord
[2:19:27] but I told him I said I said brother
[2:19:31] what are you trying to force us to do
[2:19:33] you you only want it for your
[2:19:36] gratification it's not the word of God
[2:19:40] praise the Lord
[2:19:42] and you don't see the danger of it
[2:19:44] because what you want us to do you are
[2:19:47] going to abuse your daughters
[2:20:00] now so these are the things these are
[2:20:02] the things that was birthed and the
[2:20:05] church
[2:20:06] and you have to know all that after the
[2:20:09] reformation and all these people went
[2:20:11] out uh you know uh uh uh uh on a looter
[2:20:15] not being properly taught in the word
[2:20:18] they say carry out those things
[2:20:22] they still practice it
[2:20:26] a way of keeping the church holiday
[2:20:28] is to know about the people life who are
[2:20:31] you
[2:20:32] you are born in seen simply in iniquity
[2:20:36] sir yes
[2:20:43] now you'll be calling people and
[2:20:44] demanding them to confess their sins to
[2:20:46] you who are you
[2:20:48] right which day were you born
[2:20:50] that is now on the calendar of men
[2:20:59] all of those perverseness
[2:21:08] praise the Lord
[2:21:12] preachers always looking for something
[2:21:14] to condemn the people they feel like
[2:21:16] they have preached when the people feel
[2:21:18] condemned
[2:21:20] where is the message of justification
[2:21:26] the preaching of the Gospel must convict
[2:21:28] us not condemn us it must convict us
[2:21:38] praise the Lord
[2:21:42] Hallelujah
[2:21:58] Oh What A Time
[2:22:02] what a time it was
[2:22:07] a disgraceful time
[2:22:14] and pretty soon the people started
[2:22:16] introducing
[2:22:18] things that were
[2:22:20] seem like
[2:22:21] um harmful plane
[2:22:24] amen
[2:22:25] samely I'm harmful play
[2:22:30] but yet they did not know that they were
[2:22:33] introducing themselves to a harmful
[2:22:35] spirits
[2:22:41] praise the Lord
[2:22:43] amen
[2:22:46] someone says well let's let's make a
[2:22:48] play Let's do uh saw and a wish of angel
[2:22:54] praise the Lord
[2:22:56] now whose child are you going to pour
[2:22:58] the spirit of which on
[2:23:08] praise the Lord oh it's just a play
[2:23:24] glory be to God
[2:23:26] let me tell you
[2:23:39] Halloween was considered the only day
[2:23:43] the help of the devil
[2:23:46] could be provoked
[2:23:49] for luck
[2:23:51] marriages
[2:23:54] relationships
[2:23:58] and all of that the only day that the
[2:24:01] help of the devil
[2:24:07] praise the Lord
[2:24:09] Hallelujah
[2:24:15] at 2.4 billion dollar
[2:24:19] business
[2:24:23] I realized their time
[2:24:26] will fail us to go into out of death
[2:24:29] to go into the rest of
[2:24:31] all there
[2:24:34] but in 1965
[2:24:37] the UNICEF
[2:24:39] the United Nations Branch for children
[2:24:42] adopted Halloween
[2:24:45] as a day to collect money for children
[2:24:54] the United Nations branch that must be
[2:24:56] concerned for suffering children
[2:25:01] decided to do trick-or-treating
[2:25:10] it's one of the ones that
[2:25:13] are bound to be deceived that are that
[2:25:15] are you know that are moved by the uh
[2:25:17] their their human feelings
[2:25:20] Amen to thank the others that is an
[2:25:23] organization that is taking care of
[2:25:25] children
[2:25:32] now so we have all of these things
[2:25:34] people there are just a lot of things
[2:25:35] here we can I don't have the time to go
[2:25:38] into
[2:25:39] you know I don't have the time to go
[2:25:41] into all of that I think I've covered
[2:25:44] most of my business for a while uh
[2:25:48] the Halloween part of this subject
[2:25:54] but you know there was there was nothing
[2:25:57] the the really really
[2:26:00] uh
[2:26:02] that really
[2:26:04] inspire me
[2:26:06] look into this subject
[2:26:08] then to know that
[2:26:10] that was the very day
[2:26:13] that God pulled the first nail
[2:26:15] and the devil's coughing
[2:26:18] amen
[2:26:21] showing that even though
[2:26:26] The Babylon and traits and worship has
[2:26:29] had the grip of men Through the Ages
[2:26:34] but almighty God that promise
[2:26:37] that the seed of the woman will bruise
[2:26:39] the head of the serpent
[2:26:42] no matter how dark it is
[2:26:45] how deceitful and how evil
[2:26:48] men will be God is never without a
[2:26:51] witness
[2:26:55] praise the Lord he's never without a
[2:26:58] witness God show it through that the
[2:27:00] Book of Judges how he used insignificant
[2:27:04] people
[2:27:05] and even at times where it was needful
[2:27:07] for him to use woman like jail put a
[2:27:10] nail in it in a man's Temple
[2:27:14] God will always have someone that
[2:27:17] believed in his word he will always have
[2:27:20] someone that would take him by his word
[2:27:25] he's going to have a people
[2:27:29] praise the Lord
[2:27:31] a people
[2:27:33] that I impress
[2:27:35] with their messenger's message
[2:27:41] amen
[2:27:43] not not looking for interesting spirit
[2:27:48] that's just another face on this I was
[2:27:50] ourselves I was standing let me close
[2:27:52] this book because I just keep going
[2:27:54] long past the time here amen thank you
[2:27:58] for bearing with me praise the Lord
[2:28:01] but I think I got you to the place where
[2:28:03] I could preach from now until five
[2:28:04] o'clock it won't it won't matter to you
[2:28:06] because I know I've I've been able to
[2:28:08] put all of your spirit in a straight
[2:28:11] line
[2:28:12] praise the Lord
[2:28:13] but I would not abuse that
[2:28:16] amen
[2:28:17] I will not abuse that
[2:28:20] but what I want to bring to you and help
[2:28:22] you to realize people
[2:28:24] is data
[2:28:27] we must mean business with God
[2:28:30] is not a man
[2:28:32] praise the Lord
[2:28:34] you take this Bible you hold it in your
[2:28:36] hands and put it on your arm you're not
[2:28:37] putting God under your arm
[2:28:43] praise the Lord
[2:28:46] all right
[2:28:49] I was just looking at things and and
[2:28:52] studying through the message uh uh uh in
[2:28:55] touch and spirit this morning and and
[2:28:57] that prophet of God picking up things
[2:29:01] and uh
[2:29:08] and some things she talks about there
[2:29:16] he preached a subject on demonology
[2:29:20] which of course this is what will go on
[2:29:22] because you see this thing has has been
[2:29:25] with the church
[2:29:26] another part of this is the beast from
[2:29:28] the beginning is the beast at the end
[2:29:31] it has been like this with the church
[2:29:33] Paul in the book of galaxian he won the
[2:29:36] Gallatin church he talks to them who
[2:29:37] have been with you
[2:29:40] so but you see the bewitching in a
[2:29:42] Gallatin Church
[2:29:44] is uh uh was was a different kind of for
[2:29:48] bewitching
[2:29:51] amen
[2:29:53] the bewitching in the galatian church is
[2:29:55] a different kind of a bewitching let me
[2:29:58] tell you the Witchcraft power that is in
[2:30:00] this world is no match to the spirit of
[2:30:04] God
[2:30:07] amen it's no match to the spirit of God
[2:30:12] I'm out there with people with familiar
[2:30:15] spirit in church before
[2:30:17] I'm there with that
[2:30:21] praise the Lord
[2:30:25] [Music]
[2:30:27] it's just that we don't learn that we
[2:30:29] don't learn to say everything
[2:30:31] you know but uh uh it just doesn't have
[2:30:34] things that uh that scare me
[2:30:38] because I know I have the word to deal
[2:30:41] with it
[2:30:43] amen and there's a spirit here to pick
[2:30:45] it up
[2:30:46] [Music]
[2:30:53] praise the Lord
[2:30:57] but you see when Jews started to speak
[2:31:00] about setting May creep in one way
[2:31:04] praise the Lord and those were the
[2:31:07] people that Paul was talking about when
[2:31:09] he says talking to the church who has
[2:31:12] Bewitched you we're going to go into all
[2:31:13] of that
[2:31:14] we will go into all of that
[2:31:17] you know because brother Branham talks
[2:31:18] to yet about
[2:31:20] you know how it is easier to deal with
[2:31:23] demon in the flesh
[2:31:26] because when a demon is in the flesh it
[2:31:29] makes a person sick everybody can see it
[2:31:33] everybody can see it because we got to
[2:31:35] rush this person to the hospital they
[2:31:36] are sick
[2:31:37] no matter what name that the doctors
[2:31:40] call it it's a demon that is making this
[2:31:41] person sick
[2:31:43] but when the person has a religious
[2:31:45] demon
[2:31:49] praise the Lord
[2:31:50] is the one that is difficult to deal
[2:31:53] with
[2:31:56] because there is one thing of that
[2:31:57] Spirit it justify itself
[2:32:00] in everything
[2:32:03] that he does
[2:32:06] so you see that's what I want to bring
[2:32:08] bring you know I want us to get to what
[2:32:11] we close this thing
[2:32:13] I can take care of everything tonight
[2:32:16] or today
[2:32:20] as a church just like I said the Lord
[2:32:22] has been good to us
[2:32:24] the law has kept us the Lord has blessed
[2:32:27] us
[2:32:28] praise the Lord the Lord blessings some
[2:32:31] of our brothers you know with job and uh
[2:32:35] you know some of our sisters you know uh
[2:32:38] we we we're having nurses in church and
[2:32:40] all of that all of those things are
[2:32:42] God's blessing blessing our love for
[2:32:45] young people you know who are into
[2:32:47] relationship marriage and children and
[2:32:50] all of that they are all of God's
[2:32:52] blessing but you see we cannot
[2:32:54] underestimate oh belittle the thing that
[2:32:58] had brought us this far
[2:33:00] praise the Lord
[2:33:03] amen we came out
[2:33:06] I mean when God is blessing his people
[2:33:09] that's when the church the people rise
[2:33:12] up with with a standard a standard of
[2:33:16] gratefulness
[2:33:18] praise the Lord amen oh that's where
[2:33:21] we're supposed to be on fire for God
[2:33:34] we get so blessed
[2:33:37] that we go away from church
[2:33:42] I mean God is blessing us so much that
[2:33:45] he don't want us to be in church
[2:33:50] he don't want us to be in church
[2:33:53] he's blessing us so much that we don't
[2:33:55] have time to pray oh God you have
[2:33:57] blessed me so much I don't have time to
[2:33:58] pray I don't have time to read the word
[2:34:07] let's check ourselves
[2:34:16] praise the Lord
[2:34:27] the thing about it there's also there is
[2:34:29] that I mean with uh with uh with a group
[2:34:31] like this you you you you you you see it
[2:34:35] and appreciate a lot of discipline
[2:34:37] in the head of the ones that God has
[2:34:39] placed in our midst the ones that I mean
[2:34:41] you you look to them you know as as in
[2:34:44] in a kind of a parent figure
[2:34:48] if they will not be in church they'll
[2:34:50] let you know they will not be in church
[2:34:55] yeah
[2:34:57] praise the Lord
[2:35:05] they are the ones
[2:35:09] that are up there in age they are
[2:35:11] supposed to be you know uh uh uh you
[2:35:14] know uh uh trusting the grace of God for
[2:35:16] strength in the morning but yet they get
[2:35:18] to church before many of you young ones
[2:35:22] you that have the energy you use your
[2:35:25] energy to come to church
[2:35:27] late
[2:35:40] but Bram says that's what that's what
[2:35:42] the meditation time for he says we come
[2:35:44] and wait on God
[2:35:45] we come and wait on our gifts
[2:35:59] that's why I'm going with this that's
[2:36:01] that's the thing that is concerning me
[2:36:06] just like I said you go I mean you go
[2:36:08] out you see things there are things that
[2:36:10] you see it it impresses you you say oh
[2:36:13] my God the Lord Jesus bless you brother
[2:36:15] Brian even even the church others I can
[2:36:18] read I can I can read that brother says
[2:36:19] he went to this church he saw so much
[2:36:22] other
[2:36:23] he said wow I have longed to see a
[2:36:25] church like this
[2:36:30] how the the discipline that the people
[2:36:31] have
[2:36:34] in honor of the world they are worship
[2:36:36] and all of that
[2:36:38] he says what a spirit of God can just
[2:36:40] come in among the people
[2:36:43] and people like that it's easy to preach
[2:36:45] you don't have to fight spiritual battle
[2:36:47] but
[2:36:50] before
[2:36:53] but when the people don't have no regard
[2:36:56] for the church oh no they don't have no
[2:36:58] regard for seven they don't come and
[2:36:59] prepare themselves
[2:37:02] right
[2:37:03] all they bring their battles from whom
[2:37:05] right into church
[2:37:13] then you have to deal with all of that
[2:37:21] settle down before you even start
[2:37:23] entering into your message
[2:37:28] and just like I said
[2:37:30] the Lord
[2:37:32] has been good to us
[2:37:35] the Lord is Blessing us as a church
[2:37:40] praise the Lord
[2:37:41] let's not slack in well-doing that's why
[2:37:44] Paul said to the church
[2:37:46] let's not slack in well-doing
[2:37:50] let's now slack in our our home prayer
[2:37:53] meetings
[2:37:55] let's not slop in our own personal uh
[2:37:58] devotion and discipline to the word
[2:38:00] that's all we can give God is a life of
[2:38:04] appreciation
[2:38:06] we are not living by the Lord
[2:38:09] we are living doing what we are doing
[2:38:11] because we thank God
[2:38:13] that he have brought us to this life of
[2:38:16] decency
[2:38:17] it's not a lord it's not a root
[2:38:21] it's a life of
[2:38:24] that's all we owe the Lord
[2:38:27] a spirit of gratefulness let's Stand
