[1:00] [music]
[1:31] morning. I was sitting back there with
[1:33] brother Egan and I heard brother Neville
[1:36] was saying something there looking
[1:38] towards me and I said to brother Egan,
[1:40] "Is he calling me?" And he said, "He
[1:42] is." And then here I'm up here to say
[1:44] something this morning.
[1:46] I was thinking when
[1:49] I was the fan there where there
[1:54] draws a voice just seems to pull it
[1:55] right out when you're speaking. It seems
[1:58] that the fan takes a voice right away.
[2:02] I was
[2:05] hearing some testimony when I was in
[2:07] there to pray for the woman on the phone
[2:10] and the one who got the message forgot
[2:13] to put the city of the place where to
[2:15] call from Dr. Marson's wife and I just
[2:20] tell you what I done for your all's
[2:21] prayer and mine. I laid hands on the
[2:24] phone and pointed to the number wherever
[2:26] it was and asked the Holy Spirit to go
[2:28] to the woman. But I think you hear that
[2:30] just the same as it would be if we were
[2:32] and I just laid it down. And it might be
[2:35] that that's the way the Lord wanted it.
[2:37] See, it might be it would be better like
[2:39] that.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; And then I heard the testimonies while I
[2:43] was in there. Uh someone saying that
[2:46] sister Rook had I believe Brother
[2:48] Neville said that she'd had a a mental
[2:51] collapse like
[2:54] &gt;&gt; let's hold on to God for that.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Just remembering this one thing. God
[3:01] knows his own.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; He knows all about them.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Can you hear all right in the back? If
[3:08] you can't, there's some empty seats up
[3:10] here. You can change if you wish to.
[3:14] And let's see. Is this the main mic?
[3:17] This over here is the main mic. Okay,
[3:20] we'll see if we can get that just a
[3:22] teeny bit closer. How about right around
[3:24] here, Jean? That'll be just fine.
[3:33] And sometimes I get just a little horse.
[3:35] I've been preaching quite Is that
[3:37] better? Can you hear that better?
[3:40] And uh
[3:43] we certainly remember these in prayer.
[3:48] And we want to report a glorious meeting
[3:53] &gt;&gt; uh from down in um uh am I looking at
[3:57] Sister Rook?
[3:59] &gt;&gt; I thought I looked at a lady back here
[4:01] that looked like her. I thought surely
[4:03] I'm not talking double here. I looked at
[4:06] someone look like her towards the back.
[4:08] Um
[4:10] she's in the St. Edwards Hospital and uh
[4:14] so uh at Cleveland, Tennessee and also
[4:18] in California, we had a glorious
[4:21] meeting. The Lord blessed greatly and
[4:25] many things that he did.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; And we're happy for that. happy we can
[4:32] come back to our own company reporting
[4:35] the goodness and the mercy of God.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; That's the way they did in the Bible.
[4:42] I was appreciating brother Neville or
[4:46] brother Beer's prayer how he prayed for
[4:50] the people and and asking for help and
[4:53] mercy.
[4:55] And if we'll just look along, you always
[4:58] everything it goes on, you'll find
[5:00] there's something real genuine about it.
[5:05] And then when brother Neville come and
[5:09] brought these deacons and so forth up
[5:12] here to the platform to to pronounce the
[5:16] blessings of God upon the the church
[5:19] offering.
[5:21] I heard him speaking in his prayer to
[5:24] God
[5:26] about those mans how that they prayed
[5:29] for one another.
[5:32] And that does me good to hear a pastor
[5:34] that can pray over his deacons and the
[5:37] deacons pray back for the pastor.
[5:40] When you see a church going into
[5:42] cooperation like that,
[5:46] well, something's fixing to move.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; That's the way the church has to be in
[5:53] order.
[5:54] And it gave me just an idea for a text.
[5:58] I was going to speak on the blessing at
[6:02] Kadesh
[6:04] and the refusal I'll be hearing
[6:07] of the report of the spies.
[6:10] But then I changed my mind to something
[6:12] else then.
[6:15] And now concerning healing, I got just a
[6:18] little testimony that I'd like to give.
[6:20] I was a hopes I'd see my boy Billy back
[6:22] there, but he's got it in his pocket.
[6:26] And Billy's getting to be better in the
[6:29] meetings than what he used to be. Was
[6:32] nervous, upset, and he kind of tell the
[6:34] people, "Oh, go sit down. Go sit down."
[6:36] So, I I'll give you a prayer card. But
[6:38] I've noticed recently there's get to be
[6:40] people in the meeting that he just feels
[6:42] so sorry for. If he ain't got no prayer
[6:44] cards left, then he'll put him in a room
[6:46] so I can go pray for him.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And such a thing happened at
[6:50] Chicago the last time. And I'd like to
[6:52] read that letter if if he does come in.
[6:55] I never got to see him. He didn't know I
[6:57] was coming this morning over here. And
[6:59] uh and want want the letter, but I just
[7:02] thought of it when I thought of so much
[7:03] sickness.
[7:05] And here's the way it is. It's a
[7:07] certified letter that
[7:10] I was reading in the paper. I never was
[7:12] told that where the papers was
[7:15] criticizing or Roberts for praying for a
[7:18] woman who had diabetes and died.
[7:22] And I not I as an American I I like to
[7:25] listen to the laws and and the man who's
[7:28] in authority, but I think that's not
[7:30] just.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Wonder if they'd be willing to put in
[7:34] the paper all that or Robert had prayed
[7:36] for and got healed that the doctors
[7:38] turned down. I wonder just swap it right
[7:40] back around once. See,
[7:43] &gt;&gt; they wouldn't do that.
[7:46] And then I think maybe that the devil
[7:49] has just muddled them up so that and God
[7:52] permitting it that the day of the
[7:54] judgment they'll have to answer for
[7:56] that.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; But I know of thousands of people that
[8:01] Or Roberts has prayed for that's been
[8:03] dying and they're well.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise the Lord.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; So, you see, they they are unfair about
[8:09] it. They'll deliver their side, the
[8:11] critical side, but won't deliver the
[8:14] other side. Now, the paper is supposed
[8:16] to keep the public uh up to date on
[8:20] events that happens. Then I think if
[8:23] human beings are concerned with one
[8:25] another, if somebody gets healed, really
[8:28] healed, every paper in the United States
[8:30] ought to pack the article of it.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; But you can't harm to do it.
[8:36] No, you take something like that there,
[8:37] they'll snigger and laugh at it and turn
[8:39] it back.
[8:40] But if there's anything to criticize, it
[8:43] just goes to show that this nation is
[8:45] ready for judgment.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[8:47] &gt;&gt; right.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; And there's got to be judgment and
[8:50] there's no way to escape it and they're
[8:52] only heaping fire upon their heads and
[8:55] so forth. and such a a disunified to the
[8:59] principles.
[9:01] Uh a paper its principles is to to
[9:05] inform the public of anything good or
[9:07] bad that's happening.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; But they're away from their principles.
[9:13] And when they're
[9:15] keep away from their principles, then
[9:17] they they will not serve their purpose
[9:19] well.
[9:21] And that's the same way it is with the
[9:22] church. When the church is away from its
[9:26] principles, it can never serve the
[9:28] saints well.
[9:31] We've got to stay together.
[9:34] Got to be unified. We got to be one
[9:37] heart and one accord or we'll never
[9:39] serve God or the people. Unless we're
[9:42] one heart and one accord to stand by the
[9:45] principles of the Bible
[9:47] &gt;&gt; and the things that God has said that's
[9:49] right. We must always stand by them.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Billy stuck into the room at Chicago.
[9:59] Someone come to him, a woman
[10:02] with her husband with cancer on the
[10:04] lungs dying and his wife was a polio
[10:08] victim in a wheelchair and her trying to
[10:10] take care of a man that could hardly
[10:12] stand up with cancer on his lungs.
[10:16] And Billy said to him, he said, "I I'm
[10:18] sorry, sir, that
[10:20] I'd gladly give you a prayer card. And
[10:23] he said, "But I I haven't got another
[10:25] one left."
[10:28] And he said, "Well, all right, Sunny."
[10:30] He said, "That's all right that we tried
[10:33] to get you, but so unhandy for us."
[10:37] Billy said, "Tell you what you do." He
[10:38] said, "I'm going to get Dad and I'm
[10:41] going to bring him in and I'll take him
[10:43] out." and said, "When I do, as soon as
[10:46] you hear his message," said, "then you
[10:49] get your h your wife and you and get
[10:51] into a little room there where I pass
[10:53] through
[10:55] and I'll have him pray for you." Oh, he
[10:57] said, "That's loyal, son. That's good
[10:59] enough." See,
[11:01] there's a there's an attitude. See, good
[11:04] enough. That's fine.
[11:06] And that night, Billy when he went back
[11:08] there still against what he had said
[11:12] that he had his brother-in-law there who
[11:15] was bleeding with hemorrhages from the
[11:17] lungs
[11:19] and his sister-in-law there who was
[11:21] bleeding from the stomach with ulcers
[11:24] also that they'd come in with them kind
[11:27] of on the side of helping them get in.
[11:30] You have to watch the whole room full.
[11:32] But going through and praying for them,
[11:34] we get a letter back through the mail.
[11:39] That that man has perfectly healed of
[11:43] that cancer of his lungs.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; The woman, the wife in the wheelchair is
[11:47] up going around just normally she ever
[11:49] was.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; The man with the hemorrhages of the of
[11:52] the lungs from tuber is completely well
[11:55] and his wife is well of the ulcers. Four
[11:59] of them healed straight.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; I wonder if the newspapers WOULD BE
[12:03] WILLING TO PRINT THAT.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[12:09] &gt;&gt; OH, but God still is God.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; He just does things in his own way, you
[12:14] know, and
[12:16] &gt;&gt; he's so good. We're so happy to know
[12:18] that he is God. Amen.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; We was talking the other morning about a
[12:23] little preacher that we know that used
[12:25] to go around pray for the sick and
[12:26] everything and he went and prayed for a
[12:29] person in the hospital in Louisville and
[12:31] a two burglar case, a lady dying. The
[12:34] little fella said, "Well, there's no
[12:36] need God ain't ain't no God and keep his
[12:38] word." But I just like like the Bible
[12:40] said, "If he don't keep his word, he's
[12:42] not God. It's just a book." Now, that
[12:46] would seem like that unless you know
[12:48] God. That's part of the scriptures, but
[12:51] it's not all of the scriptures.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; It's up on the basis of the faith of the
[12:56] individual. See,
[12:59] &gt;&gt; and I told my wife, I said,
[13:01] &gt;&gt; there's been so many things happened
[13:03] that I just know that there is I don't
[13:07] know what's going to happen to me at the
[13:09] end. I may go the same way. If God ever
[13:11] moves his hand of mercy from me, I'll go
[13:14] the same way. But as long as he'll keep
[13:16] his hand of mercy and guidance upon me,
[13:18] I'll go on.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; But I asked media, I said, "Who was it
[13:24] in the room that morning at the vision
[13:26] of me seeing my little girl Sharon?" By
[13:29] the way, the other day I like to
[13:31] fainted. I sitting on the street and you
[13:33] know my story, the vision of her at you
[13:36] and I look coming by my side and there
[13:38] come a young girl down the street.
[13:41] You're in Jeffersonville. was just
[13:43] exactly like that vision. I just had to
[13:45] grasp my hands together. Looks so much
[13:49] like that vision of my little Sharon.
[13:51] She's a young woman then. And after that
[13:54] vision that morning when and Gloria I
[13:57] hope was telling me had her arm around
[13:59] my shoulder saying, "Don't worry about
[14:01] us, Bill. We're better off. I just
[14:04] trying to commit suicide." And she said,
[14:07] "Don't worry. Promise me you won't
[14:10] anymore.
[14:12] And I said, "I can't promise it a hope
[14:14] because I I I'm I'm weary. I can't help
[14:17] it." And I come out of the vision
[14:19] standing in the dark room
[14:22] and not A VISION, NOT IMAGINATION, BUT
[14:26] HER ARM WAS still around me. Amen. And
[14:30] she was patting me. I thought, "Wait a
[14:32] minute.
[14:33] This is not I didn't know what to call
[14:35] it in them days, a vision." I called it
[14:37] a trance. I said, "This is her hand
[14:40] still there." I said, "Are you here,
[14:42] Hope?" She said, "Bill promised me that
[14:44] you won't worry anymore about me and
[14:47] Sharon because I was at the end of the
[14:50] road. I was ready to commit suicide."
[14:54] I said, "I promise you." And she hugged
[14:56] me and patted me with her hand. Amen.
[15:00] And then I I said, "Hope, where are
[15:03] you?" I got felt up and got a hold of
[15:05] the little chain on the light and pulled
[15:06] it. I went around, searched through
[15:08] every chair to see if she was sitting
[15:09] there.
[15:11] He's God. He's just as much God today as
[15:14] he was on Mount Transfiguration when
[15:17] Moses and Elijah appeared. He's still
[15:21] God.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; We may go through lots of troubles and
[15:25] trials. Just remember, there's someone
[15:29] who knows,
[15:31] lights the way, makes it real.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; I do not know what's behind the curtain,
[15:37] but I know one thing. I'm pressing
[15:39] towards the mark of the high calling
[15:42] &gt;&gt; every day trying to live for that great
[15:46] event that will take place someday when
[15:49] I shall see him face to face
[15:53] &gt;&gt; AND TELL THE STORY SAVED BY grace
[15:57] &gt;&gt; that's the day I live for
[16:01] &gt;&gt; leaving those things behind which are I
[16:03] want to press on just keep going
[16:07] I want this tabernacle Now that you're
[16:09] on your feet,
[16:11] &gt;&gt; I want you to keep pressing towards the
[16:14] mark of the high calling.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, cling together.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Be as clanish as you can be, but always
[16:22] with an arm out to reach and get someone
[16:24] else to bring them in.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; But in this faith that we're now
[16:29] preaching and earnestly contending for,
[16:32] DON'T YOU MOVE ONE inch from it.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. or if you believe me to be his
[16:37] servant. This is the program of God.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; It'll never be in the majority. It'll
[16:44] always be in the minority. Always has
[16:47] and always will be.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; But remember, it is written, "Fear not,
[16:52] little flock. It's your father's
[16:54] goodwill to give to you the kingdom."
[16:59] Now
[17:02] there is a group of offices of our
[17:04] church deacons, trustee, Sunday school
[17:08] superintendent, pastors as our churches
[17:11] set in order.
[17:14] And you the people elected these
[17:17] officers and this pastor
[17:21] I'm just gentle overseer see that goes
[17:23] on right and to give advice and so
[17:26] forth.
[17:27] You are the one who elects your pastor.
[17:30] You elect your trustees. You elect your
[17:32] deacons. You elect every office there is
[17:35] in this church. You the people.
[17:38] And it's your duty to stand by those
[17:42] man.
[17:43] See, for they'll make mistakes. They're
[17:46] mortal. They're just man. And they'll
[17:48] make mistakes. But if the president of
[17:51] the United States makes a mistake, do we
[17:53] throw him out as president? we forget
[17:56] about it and move on.
[17:58] That's the way we want to do our church.
[18:01] Now, I was listening to him pray a few
[18:03] minutes ago for those deacons and to
[18:06] hear back there a testimony at the door
[18:08] from the trustees
[18:10] how that with one accord you all are.
[18:14] Now stay that way. Now you members stand
[18:16] by these trustees, deacons, and pastor.
[18:21] And remember when you get this together,
[18:27] remember that it's the devil's business
[18:30] to see that that's broke up.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Now, it's always has been and it always
[18:37] will be,
[18:39] but you stand by your officers.
[18:43] That was a talk that I was going to
[18:45] make. And then
[18:47] I have here also some something for the
[18:49] bulletin board this morning about the
[18:51] meeting of the boards and their
[18:53] authority. And it'll be on the bulletin
[18:55] board. And I got a copy for brother
[18:58] Robersonson who is the chairman of the
[19:00] de of the trustees. And then I got a
[19:03] copy for brother Collins I think who
[19:05] acts as the chairman of the deacon
[19:07] board. And now all these offices are set
[19:12] according to the scripture and they must
[19:14] have the scriptural rules of what they
[19:17] must do. Therefore, the trustees has an
[19:20] office of their own and the deacons has
[19:24] an office of their own. The Sunday
[19:26] school superintendent has an office of
[19:29] his own. And the pastor is the head of
[19:32] the flock.
[19:34] Now,
[19:36] each one of these has things in common.
[19:39] And I think that your meeting should not
[19:41] be together, but it should be as each
[19:43] office because the deacons has nothing
[19:46] to say to the trustees unless they got
[19:48] some business to present to them. And
[19:51] vice versa, the trustees is over the
[19:53] finance and things of the building. They
[19:55] have nothing but the deacons. The
[19:57] deacons are the policeman of the church
[19:59] and the assistance to the pastor and the
[20:01] trustees is the holding of all the
[20:03] property. The trustees has nothing to do
[20:06] with the spiritual end of it. and the
[20:07] deacon has nothing to do with the
[20:09] financial end of it. Therefore, it must
[20:12] be and the Sunday school superintendent
[20:14] is over his Sunday school. So, I've got
[20:16] it all wrote typed out to be on the
[20:19] bulletin board. And then we are also
[20:22] going to get in a frame the doctrine
[20:25] that the church stands for and have it
[20:27] framed in here in the church. What we
[20:30] stand for, the the principles, the
[20:33] doctrine of the church. Now to be a
[20:35] church, we got to have a doctrine. We
[20:37] don't draw down any stakes and say we
[20:39] just go this far. We go out just as far
[20:42] with fellowship with everybody that God
[20:44] will let us go in his scriptures with
[20:47] the people. Now stick together, be of
[20:50] one accord, one heart, and move on for
[20:53] God.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; That's the way God wants us to do.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Now let us pray and then open the word.
[21:01] Oh precious Lord,
[21:04] we are now about to approach the
[21:10] divine word or the reading of this word.
[21:16] May your Holy Spirit interpret to us
[21:18] that which we have need of.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; And let us speak, Lord, and act and
[21:27] live, knowing that we are all
[21:30] your children by grace as you have
[21:33] called us.
[21:35] May there be a fellowship in this
[21:38] church. Seeing that we're just about to
[21:42] emerge into some great move. We field of
[21:46] bringing up other ministers to go out
[21:50] into the fields of where if you shall
[21:52] send me into the different parts of the
[21:55] world there to establish the faith and
[21:58] to have a minister ready and willing and
[22:02] trained to take over. Amen.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; And may the faith that was once
[22:07] delivered to the saints that we are
[22:09] gallantly standing for become a circle
[22:12] around the world.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord. May this little weed pile
[22:18] as it was one day when we dedicated it
[22:20] to you. May there be a church rise up
[22:24] here Lord.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. that out of it shall go ministers
[22:27] and advances and teachers and
[22:31] missionaries to all parts of the world.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; We would ask this morning a special
[22:37] blessing for our brothers and sisters
[22:39] stricker who's suffering now,
[22:43] but we know that we're all put to these
[22:45] tests.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every son that cometh to God must
[22:49] be chasened, tried, and if we give up
[22:52] easy and turned back, then we are
[22:55] illegitimate children and not the
[22:57] children of God.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Give brother and sisters stricter
[23:01] strength and power to stick to their
[23:03] post of duty.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; If they have to beg what food they eat,
[23:09] let thy hand of blessing be upon them.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. For we know not, but it might be
[23:14] through that very effort that you'd show
[23:16] the native of Africa what a real
[23:18] Christian is.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. Now, let it all be done
[23:22] according to thy will. Bless this
[23:25] pastor, Brother Neville.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; We pray, Lord, that you'll make him a
[23:32] shepherd of the flock as you have in
[23:35] past. And we would not forget his lovely
[23:38] little wife who is very sick. The enemy
[23:42] would like to leave brother Neville that
[23:44] group of children with no mother.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; But we STAND AND PLACE BY faith the
[23:50] blood of Jesus Christ
[23:52] &gt;&gt; between that enemy and our sister.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; May your spirit, Lord, be great upon
[24:01] her,
[24:02] &gt;&gt; knowing that all women are ordained to
[24:04] walk down through this valley of
[24:06] darkness of this age. We pray that
[24:09] you'll be with her.
[24:11] Bless those little children. She'll be
[24:13] nervous now and fretful, but may the
[24:17] Holy Ghost be at the door of mercy at
[24:21] all times for that family.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Bless our trustee board, our brother
[24:27] Wood, and our brother Egan, brother
[24:31] Roersonson, and all of the others, Lord,
[24:34] deacons, trustees, and all that's
[24:38] associated in the church. We pray Lord
[24:40] that you'll let them serve their term
[24:43] with holiness and
[24:45] &gt;&gt; and righteousness.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Bless those Lord who has served in the
[24:50] times past.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; And we pray that you'll continue to be
[24:54] with all of us that we will be known as
[24:56] a church of unity and spirit and love of
[25:01] the Lord.
[25:04] We pray now that you'll divide to us the
[25:07] word as we have need as we read out of
[25:10] thy written word. For we asked it in
[25:12] Jesus' name. Amen.
