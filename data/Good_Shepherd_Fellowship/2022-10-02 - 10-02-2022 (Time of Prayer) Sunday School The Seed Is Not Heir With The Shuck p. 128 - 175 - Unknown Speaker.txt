========================================

foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign no more prayer meetings no more agonized with God to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulture eyes down got into denomination put their name on the book got lazy so it suspect our goat known some kind of a dead or Karen and that's supposed to be at least a hawk that's a similar brother to the eagle the prophet that brought the true word and manifested it relies on Hape rotten man-made theology where did you get it at and some man-made Sunday school program sheep some educator killed foreign back in some Seminary tell him that the days of Miracles has passed well no such a thing as a Baptist the Holy Ghost oh this is nonsense you need to tell me that an eagle would eat that he couldn't do it no sir neither will that Christian eat on the dead occurrence for the whole denominational doctrines and things they want the word of God's trust the promise of the hour God promised rabbits in the days of Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us a full Square meal the full seven course menu for all the Seven Seals are open and everything is ready for the word of God [Music] hulks hopping like buzzers nobleman think of it how critical how the hour is this is a Hulk has long lost his identification as a whole so as a church long lost her identification as a lesser bird brother of the eagle God's prophets once the carrier of a true word justification then it become a carrier of sanctification they become a carrier of the baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration of the gifts but then when he goes on to keep going back try to eat something mannered from another day it's rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of this day knows that was all right but we got that plus until Jesus Christ has made manifest in the fullness of his power as he promised to be in this last day she is now a dry shelter it's past the spirit of God pasture is true and will not she will not be heir with the Vindicated seed word she sure will not be shall not be in the Rapture she'll be a church member it may come up in the second Resurrection be judged according to what she's heard if you're here tonight just a church member what's your judgment going to be when we all have to stand there and witness you heard the truth she no more applies Into the Blue into the unknown unto the supernatural where the powers and Heights and the promises of God's Eternal Word is made possible all things to them that believe she won't believe that she said she falls right back on the telephone wire and says my denomination says the rabbit says all right though they got maggots in him but yet they're all right see she depends on that Pentecost is like her denominational vulture sister sitting now in large Council seats now the ungodly certainly listening to her worldly politic head feeding her old vulture food of Dead Rabbits of something that passed by 50 years ago that's the condition of the Pentecostal Church oh my Justice Sarah tried to bring the promise of the supernatural by by hand-picked Hager so as a church trying to bring a Revival our great advantages across the country today A revive in our time or revive in our time all you Methodist Baptist Pentecostals all get together how can you have a Revival of fresh Manna on an old dead vulture how can you have it revived in our time the Revival will be so small that everyone ever happened Pentecostal said oh there's going to be a great thing happening it's happening and they don't know it yeah that's it yes sir for where the carcass is they're the Eagles will begin Christ Christ in you the same yesterday today and forever how true it is Sarah trying to get the promises all fulfilled you see in a great like the church they'd agree every Bible in our time by what about a perverted promise how you go to do it when God never did bless our organization he never did use an organization when a message went forth and they organized it died right there I challenge any historian to show me where it ever Rings again it died right there and stayed right there God just moved right on out of that carrier into another one right on how the Lutheran into the Methodist rolling out of the methodists into the Pentecostals now he's moved right out of the Pentecostals into the sea because it has to be the seat you can't beat nature there's no nothing else there for it to happen but the seed so the seafood produce itself he's the same yesterday today forever the same Pillar of Fire showing the same signs the same power the same God the same Miracles the same thing Vindicated the word in the Bible just exactly he's the same yesterday day and forever he's leading tonight God help us to see it believe it sure see Sarah the church hand pick Hagar it didn't work did it no her hand-picked group won't work today either doctors and phds and llds don't do it all the carriers fail Luther failed us Hager did what did Hager do Hager gave her son to another woman's bosom all right to raise her child Hagar did that gave her son her only son to another woman's bosom not his mother to raise it that's the same thing Luther did when he gave his son justification over to a denomination of who is exactly to raise him up Wesley failed the same way as Sarah did doubting his Supernatural birth being the baptism of the Holy Ghost as Sarah did at the oak tree when Wesley was introduced to the supernatural when the Pentecostal Age come on and Wesley was introduced to speaking in tugs all this a liked and made fun of it all you Church of Christ and you so-called and you Baptists and Presbyterians every one of you turned your nose up on it and went away from it right what'd you do Wesley you Soldier child again to an organization and it died and perished it's exactly right but the word the true word went right on it didn't stay in that organization it moved right on independecost and took some more with his a more matured son like the sea that fell into the womb and that's why I started in the backbone they have lungs and head and feet and age while it come to a place that it was born that's right so that's how the church has matured the same way Wesley doubted just exactly like Sarah did the tree she said when the angel of the Lord a man dressed like a angel God it was himself Elohim dressed like a man stood there with dust on his clothes and said that he had give the promise after Sarah was 90 years old and Abraham a hundred and Sarah laughed up her sleeve and said how could this be when Abraham and I haven't had well we haven't been as young people family relationship maybe for 20 years she's nearly 100 years old so me have pleasure at my Lord me old and him the old too and his stream of life is dead and my wombs dried up my breast is gone the milk veins are gone how could I have it if God said I promise it so did Wesley how can we accept them speaking in tongues and Divine Healing and stuff it's not for us in this day God said our promised him the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon all pleasure he promised to do it and he went on and done it anyhow amen and the Wesleyan Church with all of its little pollen sisters of Baptist Presbyterians and Church of Christ nazarene's Pilgrim Holiness and United Brethren and what for died right with it and the church moved on now what did Pentecost do organizes it's like the ship it done the same thing it organized itself together set itself in as a shuffle that's right Pentecost was as Mary Pentecostal Feast look what Mary did what did Mary do wrong at a Pentecostal Feast one time she was faced with a bunch of dignitaries priests when her son she couldn't find him anywhere and she went back three days journey she'd left him like the modern church today about three times five or 25 as a church left about 50 years ago or 75. no left him at the Pentecostal Feast Mary went back up with Joseph three days looking for him she'd been looking for him couldn't find she found him what did she find she found him in the temple discussing the word of God with the priest and right in the front of those priests those dignified Mary left the curtain drop she did exactly the things she should not have done call her God the mother of God a mother ought to have more wisdom in her son and she said your father and I have sought you with tears for day and night your father and I claiming that the birth wasn't Supernatural that Joseph was the father of Jesus she denied the supernatural birth Pentecost stop speaking in tongues they denied the birth of the word yes it's exactly what it did he'll take so much of it but we'll take the rest of it it denied the birth of the word just like Mary did but watch there will not be any more organizations after this what's the word itself you're 12 years old just a little bitty thing back in the shop amen he said don't you know I must be about my father's business [Music] the word corrected the church right there what are you doing all these things for you know you can't do this we'll close up our doors we won't let you come in before we know you not that I must be about my father's business sir sir true Supernatural charm she just claimed to be Joseph's son a mere man or what Pentecost did this claim to be one of three [Music] I know it hurt one of three but he was all three in line [Applause] Pentacles oh yes he is the son of the father of the Holy Ghost being oh my God but the real true word speaks right out and said there are not three of them there's one of them you're not the word of God notice there will be no more carrier mother churches denominations after this carrier shook because ain't the shut there's no more nothing less than they'll be just the green is that right it's got to be the green it's got to be the same kind it went into the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a Spirit come up on the bride to do the same things that he did see it's a reproducing again of the grain the word yet young speak for itself and no not that I must be about my father's business there's the secret of the message now just exactly the father's business what is a father's business because you think I want the father's business was in him to fulfill what Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive fulfill what Isaiah said again the lame shall leap like a heart and all these things that take place like Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among your lives and I mean it was the father's business to fulfill that word well if that come down to them stalks of them Natural Women what about these stalks of these Spiritual Church women churches means women women means churches rather is that right amen then what is it now we must be about the father's business the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what was to do vindicate Malachi 4. indicate Luke 17 30 vindicate Hebrews 13 8 vindicate Saint John 14 12. vindicate all of his word vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelations the 10th chapter of the opening of The Seven Seals and the mysteries of God even to serpent seed and old will be manifested marriage and divorce and all these other Mysteries has been hit are the pillars from all these years from the theologians and so forth yeah they are that's the father's business I think they would receive it they want to be dignified say our denominational teaches that but the Bible does but God vindicates it to be true it is fulfilling this age from the Seven Seals or just proven the denominations have just been carriers that's another one of the father's business the proof now father's business now is to show you them denominations is not his they're a man-made systems that deny the word right notice you say well Mary the very great virgin at the cross he never called her mother he called her woman carrier not mother true she was a carrier of the word but she was not the word he was the word oh yes notice also she was not identified in the resurrection with him he died rose again because he was the word he was just a character she died and still in the grave that's right so she was at the carrier not his mother not God she was just a carrier like the churches are that's right so she was just a carer not the word let's close the saying this old Pentecostal Hawks hopping around like vultures partaking of the world just like the rest of them does having a form of godliness enough to deceive the very elected if possible but denying the power thereof it says the prophet here a perfect example of what God's word said it would be in the last days a lady you'll see a church age naked blind miserable poor wretched and don't know it tie a minute she's big and Wealthy has need of nothing and don't know that she's changed from a Hulk a similar brother to a prophet to keep the word of God straight she's turned to a vulture and feeding her people on dead ecclesiastical rabbits wake up how do you expect to be identified are heirs with the Eagles [Music] when such things as that in this great hour when the Rapture is at hand oh Christian old believer if you've been a partial believer keep on attending the meetings for just a little while will you we got something here I believe the Lord wants you to know it's late I can't go any further I got to close and maybe finish tomorrow night well look let us bow our heads just a moment okay I don't want you to notice what grammar I used but I want you to think he just imagine what it said it's plain enough you could understand it I'm sure if you desire to if you're here tonight and you're without this experience I don't say you say I've danced in the spirit jumped all around yeah Hawks do the same things like the crows and the vultures I'm not asking that what are you eating at home where do you get your daily diet what are you feeding from the word of God or some oh a Karen that's been used back on her years and years ago has your experience even tonight was something that you've picked up many years ago or is it fresh and new tonight new manner that just fell from heaven and you're feeding your soul on looking tomorrow for something good and better if you're not that way now with your head spout your eyes closed and your hearts bound ask yourself this sincere question and not to me but to God would you raise your hand in a testimony of saying this God condition my soul and my spirit that I can feed only on the word of God would you just raise your hand say God bless you God bless you I don't know just exactly how many is in here is tonight I'm a very poor judge of crown but I'd say at least a third or more raise our hands that they won't condition solos let us remember in prayer now as we bow our heads Dear God I'm only responsible for saying the word and by these little simple Parables little types that people see that one's not going to be Heir with the other and we know that in the last days there's going to be people that's going to be raptured up into the heavens and some of them will be here when Jesus comes and we're looking for him to come even tonight and I'm thinking of 30 about 30 or 33 years ago knelt here maybe this time of night long 9 30 or 10 o'clock praying for a father that was lost tonight Lord I'm praying for many fathers many mothers and brothers and sisters won't you have mercy Dear God it's too late now for my father to do anything about it he's passed beyond the boundaries of this life and soon Lord we are all going to pass that way I too must go that way every man and woman boy or girl in here has to go that way and we will be accountable for what we do with the word of God how little did that man seem in the sight of David when he was spitting upon him how little will those people think this spit up on Jesus the word when he returns again those that pierced him how little will the people feel who could walk away from here and see even even not only in some great Greek words and so forth but in plain nature that teaches us God the Creator can see the carriers of the word and see the word itself and know the hour We're living and harvest time is here dear God let us not turn our back up on it for some Folly of the world but let us tonight receiving with all of our heart Lord created me a good spirit the spirit of life that I might believe all thy words and accept Jesus the word the same yesterday today and forever and believe today on the potion it slaughtered to this age granted Lord I asked it in Jesus name now I'm going to ask each one of you as you're here and thinking of this real sincerely we don't have a church for you John we have a pool down there to be baptized in as many as believe was baptized if you've never been baptized yet by Christian baptism that don't mean sprinkling pouring that means by immersing not in a title of father-son Holy Ghost but in the name of Jesus Christ
