And uh I told brother Steve we were we were we were more worried about uh uh how much we would for the place. We never thought about the weather.

Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh I took enough for the rest of the year. Praise the Lord. Amen. I told you enough for the rest of years. So, and we want to be grateful this morning to the Lord.

Amen. &gt;&gt; It gave me no reason to keep you late. So, uh we just want to do something this morning. You know, I was just I was just thinking on uh uh how to get back to uh things I've been talking about. [snorts] Uh last night I was uh looking a little bit to get back to our subject on the anointing in the house rather. Uh but there there is an area there where I'm I'm trying to uh study on a little bit and I hope that when we talk about it, it will be a blessing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we talk about it, it would be a blessing because actually uh uh what what it's all about is is to be able to help us to understand that uh uh the the eagle anointing. Praise the Lord. Amen. Okay. Yeah, that's that's right. Also uh brother Rafford uh is writing uh thanks uh praise the lord. See you have to remind me my friend is uh giving thanks uh also his wife had a baby back home &gt;&gt; on November 25th. So uh uh and everything went well. So we thank the Lord for also blessing their family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We pray that the Lord will be with our sister and also uh bless our brother with his time here with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh like I was saying, I was I was thinking about uh just studying a little bit on that ego anointing because uh uh uh when you look at that uh you know many of the times we take uh the general thought of the message uh as being honor the eagle anointing. That is true. You know the message is uh under the eagle anointing. But if you look at it in the span time of history, you realize that the ego really never started flying until 1963. Okay. Now until 1963 now uh I mean for for some for some of us that not been following following the status from the beginning. Uh some of the things I would say might sound strange to you. That's not what I'm preaching on. I'm just only trying to make you to know what I'm looking into that when we get back on the subject. Uh uh it will it will come out to you. You see uh uh the uh uh Emanuel, you have my picture there. If you can just go back to it quickly. I know you have you have seen a thousand times it's getting boring to you but that's the only way I can I can be able to help you understand what uh what I'm what I'm trying to say. So just like we said the first three church ages was under the the the lion anointing and uh the dark age which is the age of persecution was honor the ox anointing the the bed and bearer. Now, the the next two ages that follow uh uh or the next three ages that follow, sorry, uh are under the man's anointing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were all under the man's anointing. Now this is where we will understand uh you know many people uh uh with all of these believe the sign and everything they kind of uh you know people will say as well uh uh lacking said and and and even brother Brandon would tell you things that he said from Smith from Likings and from all of these people why because they were all under the man's anointing Pentecost uh the the restoration of the gate that that that happened at Zuza was all under the man's anointing. Praise the Lord. Now, so uh that's the reason why water baptism in Jesus name it was is not a mystery that was revealed. No, because under the man's anointing, the Pentecoster got that revelation. They were baptizing in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will even be surprised that seven sea is not a mystery that is revealed. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it has it was all it has always been there. It's in John chapter 8. Jesus said it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He told the Pharisees, "You are born out of out of fornication." They said, "No, the devil is not our father." &gt;&gt; So, it has always been there. Now the reason why I'm saying this is because from under this anointing you have uh uh uh you you under this anointing was the anointing of reformers. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right down here. Luther started from here. The just shall live by faith. Wesley brought sanctification right here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Pentecostals brought the the the gifts, the baptising of the Holy Ghost back to the church. But they were all under the man's anointing. Now so that's the reason why uh uh the crossing over to the capstone you find many many of us and many around the message still try to to practice Pentecost. Amen. You find many around the message they they still try to preach reformation. They're trying to reform the people. Praise the Lord. Either by changing the music, either by you know emphasizing on uh uh uh a certain line of thought. So you find that lot of that is stay around our cycles. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. more more preachers are reformers. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So you will see that right right uh uh from the beginning of his ministry. Uh uh uh uh there were a lot of things that's that's the reason why you find him on that evangelistic gift. Uh he rebuking the church. He rebuking the dress code of the people. He's calling the people out. It was all under the man's anointing. It was it was a portion of reformation until the seals were open &gt;&gt; before the eagle start flying. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was when the the the the the mysteries of God, you know, uh that tie all the loose ends were revealed. Now, so that's a portion that I'm I'm looking into and and I would want for us to to to be able to look at it because uh the reason there is that it will bring us to the place to know that uh even we oursel we can't carry ourself through a stage of reformation. We trying to stop this. You're trying to do this. You're trying to do that. All of that is beautiful, but you have to believe the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It have to be God doing it in you. You have to let go and let God have his way. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or else you would just be going in a cycle after you have tried to do this, you have tried to do that, you try to stop this, you try to stop that, you do all of these practice, you realize, you come back again the very same thing and and and it frustrate many people. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. We have to learn to let go and let God do his work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let God have his way. &gt;&gt; Let the word of God take a hold of us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When Mary said, "Be it unto me according to your word." There was nothing she physically did but just to confess to allow the Holy Ghost to overshadow her to allow the Holy Ghost to form that child in her. And that will be the same thing that that that we will have to do. &gt;&gt; It will have to be be it unto me according to your word. When you understand uh uh God's purpose for your life, And when you understand all of this, why what God has been doing with your life because I will tell you that God has been very busy with you &gt;&gt; more than you think that you were involved. &gt;&gt; He's been very very busy and purposefully busy because the purpose of the Lord can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. His purpose can never be defeated. From the day that you were born to the moment that you will leave this earth, God's purpose will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when you get to understand what he's doing for your life and and uh you know, then then it brings you to that place of rest, you know, then you can be able to enjoy the relationship that is between you and the father. But until then, you'll be trying this. You'll be trying that thing. It will just all be a guess. You did not make one contribution to bring yourself here. It was not your choice. It was his choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not your choice. It was his choice for you to be here. The one that choose you to be here had a purpose. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you think about the think about the teeth on the cross? Praise the Lord. Think about the thief on the cross. With everything that he did to find himself to the place that he found himself, God's purpose could never be defeated in the last meaning of his life. Amen. at a place where he never even had strength to do anything. He was condemned to die in in in a in a a Roman crucification. And there he said, "Yeah, thank you. You can take it down." Uh uh you know, the purpose for his life was made. Praise the Lord. right there on the on the cross with with all the the crookedness and all the lies he had tried to use to to manage his own life. Right there on the cross, God started dealing with his heart that he could see that this man in the middle of the cross never did anything. How did he know? How did he know? How did he know that this man in the middle never did anything? &gt;&gt; It was all because that God purpose for his life could not be defeated. That's why God started dealing with his heart. &gt;&gt; I mean he could have been thinking and uh I see how I wasted my life. uh uh you know, I thought I would have I I thought I would have broke the bank or I thought I would have got money for my family to lay better. All of those things could have been going through his mind. But just in that last moment of his life, something started dealing with his heart that he he started becoming more concerned about the man in the middle. said, "You and myself, we deserve this." He He don't deserve this. How did he know? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But because God's purpose can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "You will be with me in paradise." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like the way brother Andre said it that night. He preached for us that he was the last one that paradise was waiting for. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he got there not not too long. Jesus died, met him there and they all came out. &gt;&gt; He was the last one. Paradise was not complete without him. So God purpose for your life can never be defeated. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God purpose and God is determined. No matter how stubborn you are, no matter what uh you know uh what what plans you are making for yourself, God is determined that his purpose will not be defeated. &gt;&gt; God would rather your be defeated than his be defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's let's do something different this morning because we made a sacrifice to to be here this morning. I was thinking on this uh uh uh studying this the the other night. I was studing on the character of the men of David men. The Bible called them David men. Amen. David's mighty men. Davis Gillan men. I was studying on their character. I was studying on how how these guys became David men. Praise the Lord. What attracted them to David? Amen. What attract attracted them to David? And brother Brandon will say this in in the message in little baptis uh uh they got so they got so influenced by David. They that they love David and they they believed that he was coming to power in so much that the desire of his heart &gt;&gt; was a commandment to them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you have to realize that Jesus is our David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the son of David. Praise the Lord. That's that is the thing that is strong in that statement. The desire of his heart &gt;&gt; was a commandment to them. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I want us to look at a little bit. I want us to just trace. We might not be able to do everything this morning. This is just coming from my own my own devotion and meditation. Sometimes things get on your mind. you are just thinking about it and and you know I was just studing it so I just put some some few notes together [clears throat] rather not really thinking about preaching it this morning but I was just thinking that uh uh his desire has become a commandment to us &gt;&gt; his desire for worship &gt;&gt; has become a commandment &gt;&gt; and I believe that's the thing that will give us a revelation to be in the house of God or that will give us a revelation to be able to seek the face of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or when that when that when when his word says forsaken the assembling of his people, how he inhabit the praises of his people. His desire for worship has become our combining &gt;&gt; that bind us to fellowship. That is the thing that lead us into prayer. &gt;&gt; That is the thing that lead us into reading his word. It's his desire. It's not your desire because actually we don't desire it. Amen. It's his desire. Just like I said the last week, how how can we love you? The Bible says uh uh draw nigh unto God and God will draw nigh unto you. But Jesus said no man can draw nigh unto the father except the father draws. So it is not you drawing is he drawing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're coming close is because he's having the talk on the line. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just like that fish that that have got a worm that is eating on and and does not know that there is a hook in his mouth &gt;&gt; and the f the the the the fisherman has to give enough line so the fish will not feel it. &gt;&gt; He will be swimming around and swimming around and chewing on the on on on the on the warm and swimming around and then he bring it a bit a little bit closer. When a fish is getting a sense that something is in his mouth, then the man give it a little bit of a line, but he's bringing it closer. &gt;&gt; And that's what God has been doing to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what he has been doing to us. He's been using different things in our lives to draw us closer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been using different things as a bait to get our attention. to bring us closer to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he's going to get a rainbow trout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not just looking for any kind of a fish. He's looking for a rainbow trout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to get a rainbow trap. So, so that that uh that's that's what I want us to to be able to look at this morning. So actually our studic our study will start from uh 1st Samuel chapter 17. Amen. 1st Samuel chapter 17. There is there's a whole lot there in the in the in the scripture that we going to uh we're going to look at. But but first Samuel chapter 17 actually brings us to the place where David has come right into the battle with uh Goliath. When he have come bringing food for his brothers, he found himself coming right into the battle of Goliath. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So since I'm dealing with this right from I know there there just lot of verses here that we going to look at but uh uh I I pray that it become a blessing to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it was really a blessing to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. 1st Samuel chapter 17. Let's look at verse uh 26. 1st Samuel chapter 17. If we want to look at verse 26, like I said, uh this is no reason for me to keep you too late today. Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's look at verse 20. Let's get back to verse 20. and and David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and talked and went as Jesse has commanded him and uh uh uh Okay, God bless you. You can have your seat. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You can have your seat. I know I know I didn't I didn't ask you to stand, but uh you can have your seat. Thank you. Thank you. Because I've already started preaching. And David rose rose up early in the morning and left uh and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as Jesse has commanded him. And he came to the trench as the host was going for to fight and shouted for the battle. the man of of of war was screaming and shouting for the battle for Israel and and the Philistines have put the battle in a raid army against army. And David left uh his captain in the hand of the keeper for uh for the for the captain and ran into the army and came and salute his brethrens. Greet his brethren. And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion the Philistines of Gad Goliath by name out of the army of the of the Philistine and he speak I call him to the same words and David heard it. Praise the Lord. And all the men of Israel when they saw the man flee from him and were so afraid. And uh and the men of Israel said, "Have ye seen this man that is come up surely to defy Israel? Is to come up uh surely to defy Israel. is he cometh and uh it shall be that the man who kill him, the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father house free in Israel. And David speak to the men that stood by. Now, now in this whole story in David meeting the army, this is the first time he's going to speak to the men that stood by. And these men were men that were in the army. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because these were the men that that just shouted the shout for war. [clears throat] These were the same men that was getting himself enra. But when Goliath came and stood up, it looks like everybody just got frozen in their armor. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now David speak to the man that stood by saying, "What shall be done to the man that killed this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel?" I love that. Take away the reproach. For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the army of the living God? Now all of these men are standing up. They're looking at this boy uh saying this word. They are wondering I mean what kind of a kid is this? Amen. What is he talking about? And the people answer him after this man saying so shall be done to the man that killed him. And uh and El his other brother, this is David's brother now. When he heard him speak unto the man, he got angry. His anger was counted against David. And he said, "Why camest thou down Hader? And with whom thou hast left those few sheeps in the wilderness? I know thy proud and thy nothingness of thy heart. For thou I come down that thou may see the battle. And David said, what have what have I done? Is there not a cost? And he returned from him to uh towards another and speak after the same manner. And the people answer him after the same manner. Now he's keep asking what what will happen to the man that we kill this man? Praise the Lord. Verse 31. And when the words were uh uh And when the words were heard which David speak, they rehearsed them before Saul, and he sent for him. Saul now sending for David. And David said to Saul, "Let no uh let no man have fa because of him that seven will go and fight with the Philistines." And Saul said to David, "Thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for thou are but a youth, and he is a man of war from his youth." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Which mean you need to grow up. He's been fighting since you were born. Amen. And you are just a baby. And David said to Saul, "Thy servant," now this is where I want to build my story from. David is going back and forth and he's talking to all of these army men that are all afraid of uh of of Goliath. And now he's he's uh for the matter of fact even his own brother tried to intimidate him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One from his own household tried to intimidate him. The Bible says David just turned away from him and then he went to another person. What what will happen to the man that will kill this man? And then he went to another person until the word finally reached to Saul. And here Saul called David in his presence. Now listen to this. And David said to Saul, "Thy servant keep his father sheep and there came a lion and a bed and took a lamb out of the floor. And I went out after him and smote him and deliver it out of his mouth. And when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard and smote him and slew him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That servant slown both the lion and the bear. Now all of these military men that are in the army, they are all listening to David's story. Sure. Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the picture I want you to see. They are all listening to David's story because who is this boy that is just running around and he's interested in fighting Goliath. But now when he's standing and talking to Saul, I would tell you many of them did not believe it. Even David brother did not believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Many of them did not believe it. They were just listening to to to David on the story. But see where the whole thing will turn. Because there is one thing for you to talk too much. It's one thing for you to tell people all that you have accomplished. They are watching to see what you will do. &gt;&gt; And I believe that when David got a result, WHEN HE BROUGHT GOLIATH DOWN, THE VERY SAME MEN that listened to his testimony, &gt;&gt; their word, he won their heart. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There where he warned the heart of those men. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because even though THEY WERE NOT THERE WHEN he killed A LION, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THERE WHEN HE KILLED a bear, BUT NOW THEIR EYES, they have heard by the hearing of ears, but now their eyes have seen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because Goliath that they were intimidated about, he's dead. He's down on the ground. Now, so you can see how they got attracted to David. This is a shepherd boy. How did he got this man that I call the mighty man? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where we going &gt;&gt; this morning? Amen. that seven slew both that verse 30 says both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he have defied the army of &gt;&gt; the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David said moreover the Lord that deliver me out of the paws of the lion and I mean he's speaking it with conviction. He's not intimidated by the faces OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY ARE BELIEVING HIM OR NOT. HE DON'T CARE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNOW IT'S TRUTH. &gt;&gt; He's not telling HIS DREAM. HE'S TELLING HIS LIFE STORY. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. YOU SEE, DAVID WAS NOT PREACHING TO CONVINCE the people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was preaching to convict them. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when you're preaching to convince people, then you have to read bunch of co I'm saying yes and brother just so I can prove to you that I'm saying the truth. But you see, it's completely different when the Holy Ghost comes in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and gets the attention of the people because he is the preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to take that word and drive it right into your life story. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT DAVID? BUT NOW HE'S GOING TO TAKE WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT DAVID AND DRIVE IT RIGHT INTO YOUR LIFE STORY. THAT'S HOW conviction comes. &gt;&gt; If not, I'm just a lecturer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm just lecturing you on something you have heard. But I hope I'm not a lecturer this morning because I want the Holy Ghost to bring conviction to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. David said, "Moreover, the Lord that deliver me out of the paws of the lion, out of the paws of the bed, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine." &gt;&gt; And Saul said unto David, "The Lord be with thee." &gt;&gt; First he said, "You are just a kid." &gt;&gt; But now he's convicted. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he KNOWS THAT DAVID IS NOT BACKING DOWN. DAVID is speaking with conviction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT TREMBLING. HE'S NOT HE'S NOT SHAKING his trying to look for page and trying to frame his word off. HE'S SPEAKING WITH CONVICTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE LORD THAT DELIVER ME OUT OF THE PORTS OF THE BED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT DELIVER ME FROM THIS HABIT THAT DELIVER ME FROM this sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God will deliver me. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When your past experience are not just made uh uh experience in the shadow, &gt;&gt; but your past experience are so real to you because you know that there is no way you have come out of that situation unless the almighty God reached his hand down and brought you out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you have those kind of an experience, you don't care how many times you say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't care whether people have heard it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, or have not heard it. You're trying to make your point, so I must repeat it again. Amen. &gt;&gt; You get tired with it, but it's part of my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Saul says, "Go. The Lord be with you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE HERE DAVID IS NOT TALKING ABOUT HIS ABILITY. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I TOOK STONES. I always have STONE IN MY BED. I HAVE A SLINGSHOT. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. HE SAID, "THE LORD DELIVER ME FROM THE PAWS OF THE LION. THE LORD DELIVER ME FROM THE PAWS OF THE BED. THAT SAME GOD &gt;&gt; will deliver me." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. when we can talk and get oursel out of the picture &gt;&gt; and let people see the God that deliver us. &gt;&gt; Let's see. Let people SEE THE GOD THAT HELP US THROUGH our trials. &gt;&gt; Many time we we we get our right on the front page. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was enough to bring conviction to this man of war. Saul was a man of war. Amen. He was a captain. The Bible say he won battles for Israel. By the way, he was a Benjamite. They were very good left-handed people with the ball. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But it was enough for a little boy, conviction, and passion to tell him, "God bless you." Saul said, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BRING MY ARMOR. THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT THING he will SAY IS BRING MY ARMOR AND DRESS THIS BOY. You know the rest of the story you can read it. &gt;&gt; But what we are trying to see how David got his men. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How did he got those men for them TO RISK THEIR LIFE JUST because of his desire? Just because of David saying, "Oh my, I remember the well," he was not even telling him. He was just remembering Beth and remembering the fresh water that he drank. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It became a commandment to this man. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh my. I love the Lord. I love when God take you on a Bible story. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love when God take you through his word and and then he starts to he starts to open his word to you. This [clears throat] man got attracted to David testimony after they saw the result. And you read the rest of the story, you will see how uh you know he uh uh uh defeated Goliath and all that was just shouting in the coming. The people were rejoicing uh uh uh uh all over the place. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter 18 chapter 18. Amen. &gt;&gt; David has come back from war. Saul I mean Goliath is dead. Israel has the victory. Praise the Lord. The Bible even says that uh the the the people started to make music out of this fight. David K 10,000. Saul kid thousand. David K 10,000. Praise the Lord. But let's go go go on a little bit here. Uh uh chapter 18. Let's read uh uh uh verse five. Let's read verse five. If you read from verse two a little bit here, the Bible says, "And Saul took him that David that day and would not let him go no more to his to his father's house. And Jonathan and David made a covenant between No, Jonathan, they made a covenant because he loved him. David I mean Jonathan loved David as his own soul. Jonathan stripped himself of the rod that was upon him and gave it to David and his garden even to his sword and and to his bowl into his ghetto. Now verse five. And David went outsoever Saul sent him and behaved himself wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war. &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saul set him over the man of war. You have to realize that Abna was was Saul captain. He was the captain of the army. But Abnner has not come into the story yet. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whether he was there or not, Abnner will come into the story later. But what I want to I want I want us to see now because David has demonstrated such a courage. Praise the Lord. He have demonstrated such a courage and and and and Saul is so convinced. He's amazed. He's confused in a sense of how can this little boy. But what I what I want you and myself to recognize not to forget is that it was not David muscles. It was not his talent is because David has just been anointed by the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David has just been anointed by the prophet. He he he himself never EVEN HONEST TO YOU REALIZE that in that statement David never told Saul that uh Samuel came down to my father's house and he saw all my brothers and he never anointed them and I came from the field AND HE NEVER TOLD SAUL ABOUT HIS ANOINTING. HE NEVER TOLD SORD ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE WITH the prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want us to keep that in the back part of our mind. The anointing is influencing him and he don't even know. &gt;&gt; The anointing is giving him victory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointing is bringing him into position. [clears throat] Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing is bringing him INTO POSITION JUST LIKE HOW THE ANOINTING BROUGHT THE CHURCH INTO position to become the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointing is bringing him into position &gt;&gt; and he don't even know. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I encourage you this morning. &gt;&gt; Don't make a church out of this. Don't make a church out of this experience with the spoken word, with the reveal word. Don't make a church out of it. Don't make a religion out of it. &gt;&gt; Because it's a relationship. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a relationship. Is the heart of God for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need me to tell you. You don't need another man to tell you. You need God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's doing by revealing himself. He's opening his heart &gt;&gt; to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; For you to see the purpose of your life. And when you see the purpose of your life, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this life that you can take above that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this life that you can take above that. My mind is drain kind of forgetting off here. But let's let's go on now. So the Bible says here in verse five, he make him he set him over the men of war. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's drop down to verse 13 in the same chapter 18. Praise the Lord. Saul set him over the men of war. But in the backp mind this boy is becoming popular. So what he did? He tried to jack him to the wall with a javelin. And few times David will will dod it. The anointing is keeping him safe. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing is keeping him safe. That's what happen when you come under the leadership of God. You come under the anointed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It influence your choices. It takes away the desire from things that will affect your health. It keeps you safe. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have we have we have problem like like everybody has problem and uh but sometimes think about it how sometimes God will be so good to you &gt;&gt; that you go year two year three years you have really never gone to see the doctor &gt;&gt; praise the Lord it's not that you have not had pain year you have not had a headache you you have not had a cold but you just feel okay praise the Lord you just feel that a cup of water or maybe a little tinol would take the headache away from you. And sometimes we don't realize that the anointed word that you get down on your knees to pray to every morning &gt;&gt; that that anointed word you read every day that you you you take it personal. You are not reading it like a religion. You take it personal. Praise the Lord. When you read in the word that I am the Lord that heal up all your diseases, it becomes real to you. &gt;&gt; You are not reading it just to memorize Bible, but you seeing the person of Christ walking with you in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The anointing was keeping him safe. So the Bible says Saul tried to to to to jack him up or staff him up or whatever it was [snorts] and and he couldn't. So let's let's get down here. Verse 12, the Bible says, "And Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him." The Lord was with him. The anointing was working on his behalf. Saul was afraid. He was wondering what kind of a child is this? When I wake up at night to starve him, I meet him up reading his Bible. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can really find his sleeping time. Does he sleep? Does he ever find time to sleep? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Saul started becoming afraid of David. Not that David will kill him, but he just can't understand what is about this child. What what's about his life? Praise the Lord. Let's look at verse 13. Therefore, Saul removed him and made him a captain. Now, he was set over the army. BUT NOW SAUL STARTED BECOMING afraid of him and remove him and put him over a certain man to be the captain of a certain group the the the uh how you call it the tactical group. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I said David you know you you are so scar so skillful. Yeah. You take these hund men or how many men they were and you rule over them. Now he's no longer the cap. You're no longer over the man of war. Now he's with a certain group of men. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember, now you have to remember we're talking about military men and and and military things have never changed. You read in the Bible, you still read about ambush. You still read about uh conspiracy. You still read about betray. You still read about overtaking. I mean uh all of those things happened before. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. How David became or this man became David's mighty man. That's what we're trying to look at this morning. Praise the Lord. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's look at verse 27. You can do all your reading. I spend time to just skip these verses for you. Praise the Lord. Verse 27. The Bible would tell us here that uh uh there came a time. There came a time. The story behind this here is that there came a time where uh uh uh because now David has uh has killed Goliath. The promise was the king would make him rich and the king would give him his daughter. Till now David has not married to Saul daughter. Praise the Lord. For whatever reason only saw knows. Are we together? &gt;&gt; David position. For the very fact you read the story for the very fact those people started h singing some for David and everybody talking about David Saul became threatened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. If I give this boy my daughter, I mean he can kill me and then be become the one to rule the kid. My son Jonathan is gone after him. You love him. Saul is now worried. So okay, I have to keep my promise because people are reminding you reminding Saul Saul you have not fulfilled your part of the deal. you have not given David your daughter. Praise the Lord. I don't know what was coming up in the newspaper those days. I don't know what they were publishing. But Saul was under pressure. So he comes here now and he says to David, let's look at this together. Verse uh verse 27. Wherefore David arose. Now he gave David this this thing that David must go out and kill uh uh uh uh uh a hund Philistines and bring the bring the false skin of those Philistines to him. Praise the Lord. And when that happened, he will give David his daughter. While David was gone for war, he took the daughter and gave her to another man. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. David came back the the daughter was not there. This is the same Lab and uh uh Richard &gt;&gt; and Leah story. Amen. &gt;&gt; He sent David again to go and bring kill another hund Philistine. Bring their false skin. I will give you now and I will give you uh uh my other daughter uh Michael Michelle. Now, but this is what I want us to see here. This is what I want us to see. Wherefore, David arose. Verse 27, he arose and went. He and his men. I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to make the emphasis on how how now this was David personal mission. This was David mission. He was supposed to fulfill this so he can have the king's daughter. But now there are certain men that are be beginning to attach themselves to David. There are certain men that are beginning to fall in love with him. They like his word of life. They love his zeal. I mean uh he can worship. I mean when he get down playing the heart THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN. Now you also have to realize that these men were not there. They did not know that David was anointed to be king. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT they just can't put TOGETHER BUT IS DRAWING them to him. &gt;&gt; So David going on this personal mission. The Bible say he and his men they slew the Philistines. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's go over to uh uh chapter 21. 1st Samuel chapter 21. We tracing [clears throat] David and his men. Praise the Lord. Now, as you get over to chapter 21, what I want you to realize here is that David and Saul has already break up. Saul has become so threatened. David realized his life was in jeopardy. Now, he has run away from Saul. Praise the Lord. Now, so the concept I'm trying to bring to us is that these men that that got attached to David were men that he met in the army of Israel. Men that he he saw in uniform that were that were trained soldiers and and all of these men. H but YET THEY GOT ATTRACTED TO THIS BOY WITH a slingshot. Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE COURAGE THAT HE HAD, THE MAN THAT COULD STEP DOWN THERE AND HE WALKED. HE DID NOT even hide himself. He walked straight to the face of Goliath. Goliath saw him and say, "I will feed you to the birds." GOLIATH LAUGHED AND SAID, "WHY YOU SEND ME A CAVE? WHO CHILD YOU SEND ME?" NOW THIS MAN SAW IN THE LIFE OF DAVID SUCH A COURAGE IN SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE READY TO BREAK away from Saul and cleave unto him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. THEY REALIZE THAT RIGHT HERE WITH THIS SAUL IS just dictatorship and every TIME SAUL HE'S JUST PLANNING he I mean he's he's putting one man against another man in the camp and and you see this man you watch over him and he goes to this man and say you watch that guy he always talking about you he go to he just putting confusion among the people &gt;&gt; they are not getting a good sense of leadership praise the lord when it comes to David it's not that David is giving a command and he's teaching them leadership. No, they are seeing it in his life. &gt;&gt; The way he carry himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you imagine when it was announced that Saul threw a javelin? Why? Why would he do that? I wonder how the David even knew Saul was a Benjamite. Those people THAT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE SAUL AND AND bow and arrow, THEY DON'T MISS. SO, HOW DID DAVID ESCAPE THAT? The anointing was working &gt;&gt; on his behalf. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when we come out of tough things, &gt;&gt; we always like to praise ourself. &gt;&gt; We always like, you know, I was praying, you know, the Lord, you know, I you know I was really watching this. We don't see the unseen hands &gt;&gt; that is keeping us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is protecting us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't see it. We don't see the hand of protection. David was not announcing himself but these men were watching his life and so much they were able to detach themselves from the army of Israel. Now they all has become h fugitives they're running around with David no food David is David does not have money for them to pay their rent to send money to their to their to their family. What is behind this boy that they should LEAVE A GOOD JOB? THE ARMY OF ISRAEL leave their salary and they are stuck to this boy. Follow me a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just follow me a little bit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Chapter 21. Let's look at chapter 21. And David came to knock to uh Aima the the the the priest and Amela was afraid at the meeting of David now because David has break away. Everybody know that Saul is looking for David. So people are afraid. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he said on onto the land said to David run find out how the arrows which are shot. No no no. Is that what I'm reading? No. No. I'm reading I'm reading what Jonathan said to David in chapter 20. Should be reading 21. And David said to Ahima the priest, "The king hath commanded me in a business, and have said unto me, let no man know anything of the business where of ascending, and I've appointed my servant to such and such a place." Now therefore what is what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in mind of what there is present. Now so David comes down to the priest here. Uh now the thing that attracted me in this verse as I'm listening to David's men is that uh it is not only that they just love David but they are also getting attached to his life of consecration. Because if you read the story here, the priest is going to ask David, "Have your men been running around with women. Have they been drinking?" Because the only bread I have here is the short bread of the temple. &gt;&gt; And I cannot give it to people that are not living the right kind of a life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So it it it gave us a thought that they were not just only liking David but they are now becoming attached to his lifestyle. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If David is keeping himself in consecration, his men are also keeping themselves in consecration. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the and the priest said unto David, there is no common bread under my hand, but but there is a hollow bread. If the young men have kept themsel at least from women, and David answered the priest and said unto him, of a truth, women have been kept from us about these three days since I came out. And the vessel of the young man are holy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they are now beginning to attach theirel to David lifestyle. Their anointing is influencing them slowly. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the greatest the greatest form of teaching is a life of example. &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest form of teaching is a life of example. It's not all that we can explain and how we can break it down, &gt;&gt; but the way we live it out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that that anointing that is influencing you, that is guarding you that way, it rub against the people that are attracted to your life. Are we together? &gt;&gt; They're influenced by David ways of life. Praise the Lord. Are we together? Chapter 22. Now it's good it's good to have you going like this. So you see how much I sit I I I sit there and just by the grace of God I'm just uh spending time and saying Lord just just just open this thing to me. Whatever it is just just show it to me that I be able to bring it to the people and be a blessing. I was not thinking about this but that just what dropped on my heart. Chapter 22. Let's look at it a little bit. Amen. We found a place to close here. We are right right around where I can leave you hanging. Amen. And then you go and do the rest of uh this study. Chapter 22, let's read from verse one. David therefore departed hence and escaped to the cave of uh Adelam. And when his brethrens and all his father's house heard it, they went down to him. Listen to this. Listen to this. and everyone that was in distress. &gt;&gt; This that this is the character of the people that was around David. &gt;&gt; This is the character of the people. When we think about mighty men, we only look at uh you know uh uh the associates. Mighty is not just in the things that we achieve. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because the Bible would tell us right here, these men were men that were distressed. They were the ones that were in debt. And everyone that was uh uh discounted gathered himself unto him and became and he became a captain over them. And there and there were with him about 400 men. Praise the Lord. So look at these men. Look at the things that they were going in. But yet in it all the Bible call them mighty men. &gt;&gt; The Bible call them gilling men. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were I mean they were h IN DISTRESS. WHY? BECAUSE I MEAN THEY don't have a permanent job. I mean they don't even have a an apartment to live in. They are jumping with David from from one cave to another cave. They have little children. They have wife. They have their parents. There was h no cell phone for them to be sending text message. I mean they were they were they were in some form of distress just like you and myself go through different form of distress. There are different things that comes up. Praise the Lord. No, yesterday we were we were going out there for for the fellowship. So, uh uh I went through there the uh you know uh uh Jalai bridge place want to see my new grandson [laughter] where I had their little daughter with us. Uh uh and so I took her home and see the baby and then uh uh and then we were uh Redeem was with me. So we were coming coming down this side to pick up something and and I wanted to pass through here also like I normally do. Just wanted to come and just do some few things before I head out there. And uh so just coming down and trying to get on on uh 100 coming for 494 trying to get on 100 and and I mean the rose with with our first huge you normally experience there. Just slid it and went right in the middle of the road. My vehicle spin and uh I just just thank God nothing happened. Amen. But I was just thinking about it. So wow. Thank God that I mean I deliver that little baby or it was going to scare her, you know. Uh I know redeem also was a little bit scared. So came and then uh she had to go with sister Joy. [clears throat] Uh, and then I came and did what I wanted to do. And I left after after we left yesterday and and had to drop uh uh the reac home and on my way back. I got on on 35 South. The very same thing I just got off the exit. You know, I have gone over a black ice and, you know, hit the medium and just spin around and and uh, you know, busted the front of my vehicle. So I sat there and and I knew the vehicle time was up. Amen. I was saying to myself, I'm going to drive this vehicle until 500,000 miles. Praise the Lord. And I just sat there. I says, "Well, Lord, I thank you that I was able to drive the kids home and I'm alone that all of this happened and just, you know, did what I could do and just got home." But I'm I'm just saying that we go through different form of distress. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You see, but but until sometimes you tell people, it's not something that you wear on your face. And it's not because you are not hanging your face down and and complaining. It does not means that you don't have problems. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see uh that's the reason why God symbolize his anointing with oil. And what oil does is that it shine your face. Just use some oil on your face. You see how bright your face is going to shine. [laughter] AND BECAUSE WE COME ON the anointing of his word, it brighten our face. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It brightened our FAITH THAT SOMETIMES SOME of the painful things you are going through, THERE IS NO WAY THAT people will ever be able to tell &gt;&gt; unless you tell them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see that's the reason why God could look down on GIDEON AND SAY, "THOU MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR." GOD COULD CALL HIM MIGHTY NOT BECAUSE OF THE THINGS around him. Because Gideon was afraid, but God was looking at a supernatural element. God was looking at a seed of God in you when he call you mighty. AND WHEN GOD THINK OF YOU MIGHTY AND THINK OF YOU being his son or being his daughter, it's not because of any of your athlete achievement. &gt;&gt; It's because of what he put in you &gt;&gt; and because of what only he can see. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When other when other don't think that you are a good child of God or a good son of God, God sees different. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When all saw a shepherd boy, God saw a cake. &gt;&gt; When even JESSE HIS FATHER THOUGHT THAT HE WAS JUST GOOD TO KEEP SHEEPS because he was small, God saw a cake. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT THIS THIS WAS THE PLACE THAT THAT REALLY, like I said, I want I want to see if I can close here. This was the place that really got me. It got me so much that in my notes I highlighted it. I just I just brighten it. &gt;&gt; I said because this is it. This is really what it is. This is what these men were made of. They had depths. [snorts] &gt;&gt; They had things going on. But when it cames to what matters, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When it cames to what matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE FIRST THING OF THEIR LIFE. THEY WERE not making excuses. Oh, you know, I'm not paying my rent here or you know, my my I don't have a car here or YOU KNOW THAT. NO, WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT MATTERS, &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING WAS WAS LESS IMPORTANT. WHY WOULD THIS MAN BE BROKE AND IN DEPTH? WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO RISK THEIR LIFE TO GET DAVID A CUP of water when they could go and and take care of their family? They could go and and and AND FIND SOME KIND OF A JOB TO PAY OFF THEIR DEBTS. WHY WOULD GIVING DAVID A CUP OF WATER BECOME SO MUCH important &gt;&gt; than them taking care of their own problems? Why? Praise the Lord. Amen. We must ask ourself why why would living right become so much problem when sometime there are things that you could do and nobody will know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are things that you could do and nobody will know and your life could be a little bit better. But why is living right so important to you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why is living right, doing the right thing? Why is it so important to you? WHY IS READING YOUR BIBLE SO IMPORTANT TO YOU? Praise the Lord. There is no card where you read your Bible. You have to bring it to church every Sunday. Let's look at and see uh uh what book you have read and and and how far you are. There is no nobody taking record on you. Man, I mean this caught my mind that these men. They were in distress. They were in debt. Praise the Lord. That's the life of the mighty of David. Praise the Lord. They have something going on. They have something going on. Amen. They have something going on. Some of them have family problems. Some of them were not married. Some of them their children went astray. THEY HAD ALL FAMILY PROBLEMS. You see what it is when you when you just when you put the word of God in a context of your life. &gt;&gt; They were not CALLED MIGHTY MEN BECAUSE THEIR THEIR LIFE WERE PERFECT. THEY WERE NOT CALLED MIGHTY MEN BECAUSE I MEAN THEY HAD EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING RIGHT for them. David was not king yet. He never had no money. How was he paying these people? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you think about it, the things that we do for the Lord. Who paying you to clean the church building? Who paying you to come and do things around the church and and the things that you are doing? Brother Steve, who paying you to keep the books? Who pay you? But yet there is SOMETHING IN OUR LIFE THAT makes you you feel committed to that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You feel committed to that. That when THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT YOUR MIND, YOU HAVING A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE, BUT THEN WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG AROUND THE HOUSE OF GOD OR SOMETHING WRONG IN THE LIFE OF A BATTLE YOUR MIND, I SAFE TO SAY YOU DON'T HAVE NO OTHER PROBLEM IN THE WORD. THE GUYS WERE NOT ON SALARY. Some had children to feed wife to send money to. They did not know how to work. They were fugitive running around with David. We read the scripture we get there. When David took over, he made them captains. He rewarded it. &gt;&gt; When David took over, he rewarded it. If we only serving God because of what we want to get in this life, You are of all men, Paul say miserable. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You'll be miserable because you will be disappointed. If we are only serving God because of what we want to get in this life, hoping that our life on earth will become better. will get some kind of a paradise and people will be working for us. They have things going on in their life just like you have things going on in your life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see, God was using all of those situation going on in their lives. And I sure believe. Let me take one more. What's the time here? Two minutes to one. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can we take one more? Will you allow me? &gt;&gt; Let me take one more and then we close here. &gt;&gt; Find a place to close. Praise the Lord. [clears throat] And I want to take this in a little form of contracts. I'll read some few things, brother Brandham to you. Yeah, maybe let's let's do that. God's gift always find his place. [clears throat] Let's read something here and and bring us then I will take their portion and close. And how that these Gillan men know noring David was anointed and was going to to come king someday. Very unpopular day because he was a fugitive among his people. But one day his call comes. They had gilling men with him. And remember these those men were Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Most every one of them were Gentiles. a very beautiful type of today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you read the book of Acts, I think Acts chapter 15 in the council of the believers, you will see where James when they were talking about the Gentiles coming in. You will see where James talks, he took the prophecy from Amos talking about the tabernacle of David. When God promised the tabernacle of David. James is taking that promise of the tabernacle of David and he's attaching it to the Gentiles that are coming in. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so you will see that uh these men that were Gentiles, they [snorts] were our fathers. They were not in the covenant of Abraham. BECAUSE OF THE POSITION THAT THEY TOOK, BECAUSE OF THE ZEAL THAT THEY HAD TO STAND WITH DAVID. YOU AND MYSELF, we are sitting under the grace of God and enjoying the blessings of God. WE ARE ENJOYING THE GRACE that has come to us freely &gt;&gt; that sometime we don't show enough appreciation for. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But it was their blessings that we are enjoying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BECAUSE THE STOOL WITH A SON OF David or David himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS REWARDED US OF HIS GRACE &gt;&gt; IN SO MUCH THAT JAMES WILL HE WILL HE WILL STOP THE COUNCIL OF JEWISH BELIEVERS AND SAYS DO YOU REMEMBER THAT GOD promised &gt;&gt; to do A WORK. YOU REMEMBER THE TABERNACLE OF David &gt;&gt; who built those tabernacle were gentiles. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we say that we are saved by grace, there was somebody that did the work &gt;&gt; for you to enjoy the grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so they were gent, gilling men. Remember those were gentile. Most every one of them were gentile. A very beautiful type of today. And one man was so gilling he killed 800 men with his spear himself. And one day another one standing in the field of lentils and an army come up, a troop. And all of them run. and he stood there and slayed men until his arm was tired. &gt;&gt; Well, all of those things they doing, they get bills, they had deaths, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have families. &gt;&gt; Sometimes where people will get so so overwhelmed. Oh, I've been serving the Lord. you know, I've been serving the Lord and all the time I've been serving the Lord and Lord, what what have you and then you we just bring it into into that a man will be running after running the battle with a fugitive fighting so much that his arm was tired. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then another one, how he jump into a pit and kill a lion on a snowly day. Amen. A day like this. &gt;&gt; It's called every word. &gt;&gt; And that's why let's let's kill our own giant. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's kill our giant. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's let's come together. Let's kill our owner giant. &gt;&gt; Or our own lion because the devil is a rolling lion seeking for to devour. Amen. But you just think about it. You just think about it. What what importance is that when there are other things important in life? Whatever his name was, I can't even think about the gentile name to give him. I would have asked him, have you b a house for your family before you killing lion? &gt;&gt; You be house for your family. When you die, your children will get place to stay. You killing lion. Whatever his name was, what are you leaving? What are you living as an inheritance? I would have loved to ask him those question. Or is it a lion skin you going to pour on the wall? How big is that lion that you can make a tent for your children to sleep on? &gt;&gt; I'm just saying there to bring certain things in context. &gt;&gt; The Bible says they were men of like passion. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have all the same things that we are dealing with in our life. Don't get me wrong. Don't get me wrong. Don't throw me on the side to think that if you do those things, you are wrong. You are out of the will of God. No. But I'm just trying to tell you that they had need in your life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Until we leave this body, the needs will never finish. &gt;&gt; After you have saw one, another one will come up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. They will come up. They are just like rent. a mortgage. That's just how it is. As soon you pay the rent, you smile. 30 days is coming. After the 15, the 20, then you start thinking again, man, I need to pay this rent. Praise the Lord. But I'm I'm I'm trying to say all of those things were there. It never took what they thought it was important. Amen. &gt;&gt; It never it never it never took it from them. They had all of these things in their life. But what was major to them? These men, they were said sit at night with David and tell and and said, "David, can you remember that day when you came to the army? Let me be let me be honest with you. When you came, I look you up and down. &gt;&gt; I said this one, I would slap him. You think have fun we playing here that day when I look at you David I say who child is this people water time they ain't taking care of their children allowing their children to run I just thought you run away run away from home the other guy says it's funny the same thing you were thinking I was thinking about it I wanted to beat the video I wanted to be by way because we haven't challenged change. Everybody running there. He here running around. What would the king do? What would the king and sitting down with David? &gt;&gt; So, you know, when you started to talk about you killed a lion, man, I was thinking some of these children, they can lie. that he is sleep lion you can kill fly before you kill lion that's why I was thinking in my mind praise the lord because you see sometimes it take conviction &gt;&gt; now these guys were convicted they know that David was the real deal &gt;&gt; praise the lord they know that it was the real deal THEY NEVER HAD THEY HAD never had nothing in them for them to hide I MEAN THEY HAVE STUCK THEIR LIFE WITH THIS MAN. THEY'RE READY TO DIE FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then they will go about and tell David, say a little bit, how did it happen? How did you kill the lion? Did it came on you and how did you do? And while David is talking this, they are imagining in their mind themsel &gt;&gt; if this boy of this age can kill the lion. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If I see a lion, I might try. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND AS DAVID TALKS ABOUT IT MORE AND MORE and more, what makes you have the desire to lay your hands on the sick to pray? &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY? WHY CREATE IN YOU THE THE DESIRE THAT OR WHEN THERE IS A NEED, YOU BELIEVE THAT GOD CAN HEAL THE PERSON, THAT GOD CAN RAISE THEM UP. WHAT MAKES THAT? BECAUSE YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT that you want to experience it. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AND OVER ABOUT KILLING THE LION, KILLING THE LION, KILLING THE LION. &gt;&gt; This one was passing and saw the lion in a hold. He said, "This is my opportunity." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is my opportunity. THE SAME GOD, &gt;&gt; WOW, &gt;&gt; THAT DELIVERED DAVID WILL DELIVER ME. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; He jumped in the horde &gt;&gt; and he came home that night with his testimony. &gt;&gt; Says, "If you don't believe me, come, come. Let me go and show you. Come down. You see that line?" I killed it. &gt;&gt; That's what happened. &gt;&gt; The word wrote against us. &gt;&gt; It create in you the desire for the impossibility &gt;&gt; THAT TO YOU ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE &gt;&gt; because God said it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It creates endure. You want to see Jesus on the scene. &gt;&gt; You want to be able to experience a firsthand miracle. &gt;&gt; You want TO BE PART PART OF IT THAT YET IT HAPPENED. WE PRAYED and it happens. As much as it's good to talk about others testimony, you want to talk about yours. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He jump in the pit on the snow and there single-handed and an Egyptian run after him with a long spear and he took the stick and knocked the spear off his hand, took the spear and killed the Egyptian himself. And killed 300 captains. Praise the Lord. These guys were under the same anointing because they have identified with David. They have identified with his word. That's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour. It's not just only David said he killed lion and David said he killed bear, &gt;&gt; but they have identified with it so much &gt;&gt; that they experiencing the same thing in their life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But do you see the paradox? With all the supernatural they are experiencing, it still did not take their life trouble away. &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to see. &gt;&gt; With all the supernatural, it did not take their life trouble away. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. With all the supernatural, he were not there. Yes. I'm I'm standing with David to become king and and you know supernaturally money will get in my bank account and and no they still they still have to deal with what they are dealing with. &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER WE ARE DEALING WITH DEAL WITH it &gt;&gt; but let the word of God &gt;&gt; has the preeminence. &gt;&gt; LET'S THE LOVE FOR GOD'S WORD LET THAT LET LET NOTHING YOU ARE DEALING WITH IN THIS LIFE &gt;&gt; DIMINISH THE LOVE OF GOD. TAKE YOUR DEVOTION AND YOUR SERVICE AWAY FROM God &gt;&gt; because you have this problem. YOU HAVE THAT PROBLEM. EVERYBODY has problem. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said the birds have nets. The foxes have ho. &gt;&gt; The son of man never even had a place to lay his head. &gt;&gt; Never even had a place to lay his head. &gt;&gt; I guess he woke up from a good bed this morning. took a warm shower to be here. Everybody has problem. Everybody is going through one thing or another. &gt;&gt; Don't blow it into people face. Nobody cares. Nobody cares. The song says, "Nobody will care for you like Jesus." &gt;&gt; As long as Jesus cares, that's what matters. And that's what must matter to you to know that he cares. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; All of these things these people did for David, I'm going to stop here. Let me just take the one that I wanted to take. And then now I will close. Amen. Let's look in chapter 23. We were in chapter 22. Let's look in chapter 23. Chapter 23. What what you will see here is there what caught my attention as I was reading was there David is praying to the Lord. David is praying to the Lord. Let's look at chapter 23:12. He's consulting the Lord. [clears throat] David uh uh 23. Let's look at verse 10. Then David, Then said David, oh Lord, God of Israel, that servant has set in the heard that Saul seeketh to come to kill her to destroy the city for my sake. Will the man of Kla deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down as that servant has heard? Oh Lord God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell that seven, the Lord. And the Lord said he will come down. Now we talk about David devotion. I'm also wanting to show David prayer life. So he were not just running. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was some sense of devotion. In all of his life of fugitive, he did not abandon his prayer life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He heard something was going on. They cried to God and say, "Lord, if we stay here, will this will this man deliver us in the hands of Saul? We heard that he's coming." Are we together? Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, uh uh verse 13. Then uh David and his and uh his men which were about 600 arose and depart out of Klad and whensoever they could go and it was told Saul that David was escaped from Klad and he forbid to go forth because he was going to come so he did not forsake his prayer life. Let's look in chapter 24. I will take this one. That's the main one I wanted to get to right here. And then we'll stop there and maybe we will continue. Chapter 24. Chapter [clears throat] 24 will bring us to the place where David cut the garment of Saul. But what I want I want us to see here is that uh David you will see in the reading where David men put pressure on him to do that. Okay. The people around him sometimes it looks like the running is is is too much. If we can kill Saul, you take over and everything ends. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at the reading a little bit. Chapter 24 we take uh yeah from verse three and and he came to the ship by the way verse two let me take verse two then Saul took three 300 chosen men out of out of uh all Israel and went to seek David and uh 300,000 men and David only have 600. He took 300,000 men and David only have 600. That crossed my mind just now. So that's what I stopped. He took 300,000 chosen men out of Israel and went to seek David and and his men upon the rock of white goats and and he came to the ship coat by the way where where was a cave and saw when uh he went in to cover his feet and David and his men remain by the side of the cave and the men of David now that's that's where that's where it is now the men of David said unto him, "Behold the day, the day of which the Lord has said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thy enemy in thy hands, that thou may do to him as thou seem good unto thee." Then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul rough private. How did he break into the ranks of 300,000 men? I don't know. But uh that that that's that's that's where I want us to to see that the people are getting tired. They are getting tired of running around. THEY MIGHT GET BACK TO THEIR FAMILY. LIFE MUST GO ON. &gt;&gt; WILL WE ALWAYS JUST BE IN THIS HUSTLING, struggling condition? WILL THE CHURCH ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS? WHY can't we do this? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why can't we do it? Why can't we do this? Let's come up with an IDEA HOW WE CAN solve this problem. Maybe one one one service a month will be better. Praise the Lord. Or people can take it a while. They have to take it on just Sunday. Maybe Sunday service will be better, you know. So I'm I'm just saying that uh they put such a pressure on David. But I want you to see what is going to happen after. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS DAVID WENT in there and he cut the skirt of of Saul. Cut off his garment and he said unto his men, "The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed." David after responding to the pressure of the people he felt a conviction in his heart. &gt;&gt; If the Lord will deliver my enemy in my hands and this is not the way that is going to happen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If the Lord is going to bring us out of this situation is is this is not the way that is going to happen. We don't have to force things to happen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's follow the Lord. Let's let's love him. Let's fall in love with him. He said the Lord forbade me to do this because this man is still the Lord's anointed. Praise the Lord. And David heart is condemning him. I should do this thing unto my masters. the Lord's anointed to stretch forth my hands, my hand against him. Seeing he is the anointed of the Lord. So David still his servant with these words and suffer them not to rise against Saul. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now they influence him to DO THAT. &gt;&gt; HE REALIZED THAT HE'S ON A CONVICTION THAT is wrong. And then he come back to the guys and tell them gentlemen what we did is wrong. &gt;&gt; That that is leadership. &gt;&gt; When we can assume responsibility not looking for people to blame but when we realize that we are wrong we can sit down and says I'm wrong. I was wrong when I did this. I thought it was going to help but it didn't help. I was wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not blaming THE GUY. WELL, YOU PEOPLE TOLD ME TO DO IT. Y I mean, you don't know that the word of God said we No, he's not casting blame aside. But he was able to steal the man that nobody woke up because the guys were ready to bring Saul to an end. David take over the throne. They go back to their family. They received their reward and they live ever happy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But David stayed there. They said what we did was wrong. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I would tell you &gt;&gt; when we assume responsibility, when you can bring your heart to the place to realize and tell yourself blotted, I'm wrong. You were wrong to do this. That is a very strong sense of repentance. And maybe trying to go and and and and spend three days of fasting and praying is good if you want to push yourself before the Lord is a good thing to do. Praise the Lord. BUT NO MATTER HOW YOU CAN PHRASE your words, see brother Brandon when he told his wife, tell them I'm not here, he jumped out of the door. Amen. when he came to the place and realized that he was wrong. He never frame it. Nothing different. He didn't look for excuses to back it up and dress it right. He said I was wrong. I WAS SO MUCH WRONG that when the phone rang the the next time my little son Joseph said, "Daddy, should I tell them that you are not here?" He said, "You see how influence wrong influence spread and brother Brandon never said it on tape. We would not know about it. &gt;&gt; But he was not ashamed to be able to tell us when he was wrong that he was wrong." Why? Because he was a him. It's not God. Praise the Lord. And he's still the man. Character. Character. Now those mighty men saw character in David. They saw character in him. Now always wanting to be right that we got to turn the picture around. You try to turn it around and try to fix it. It's still not right. But &gt;&gt; the B keep getting bigger. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Say God forbid us to do that. And the Bible say he still the man that they would not rise up from their place. And the next morning, David got on the rock. He called out to Saul and he even apologized. He repented. Saul said, "My son David, I love you. I know you will not do no evil to me. Come home, David." Praise the Lord. He had drunk his own rage. He's drunk on his own rage. Jealousy has eaten him up. But that was the character. We'll continue. Just wanted to bring few of this to you. That was the character of the mighty men of David. They were just not mighty just because of their great achievement. They were mighty because in THE MIDST OF ALL THAT they were doing they still choose to stay with the word &gt;&gt; with everything that was happening around their life. Their commitment to the word. Praise the Lord. Their commitment to the word, their devotion to the word was important. Are we together? &gt;&gt; You see, were you able to grab the picture? They were all men like men of like passion like we are. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sisters, you can come back to the music. They were men all men of like passions. They had their struggle. They had the different things they were dealing with in life. They had their life projects. They thought that by the certain time they will have been promoted to major or to captain. Y say they find themselves running with David from one hole to another hole. They were in distress. They had debts. Some of them their position affected their family and different things was going on. We all were deal with different things in our life. The idea that the the the church world tried to sell to us. That's the reason why I say bunch bunch around the message. We stay under the man's anointing because we are still looking for good method to serve God. We are still trying to create good method. Easy way, easy way that will make the that make the message appealing. I'm telling you what will make the word appealing is a consecrated life. &gt;&gt; It's a consecrated life. That life will rub against someone and you will become the line that will be drawing and they will not even know how they got there because you just love the Lord. And because you love the Lord, you love people. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love people. You love to talk to people. You love to greet people. Your love for God don't makes people strangers to you. Most especially the ones that don't that don't believe that don't see the hope that you have in your heart. If our Lord Jesus went down to hell and hell would not corrupt you. Praise the Lord. The love of God in your heart, there is no element of evil that can corrupt you. What I want us to do this afternoon put in context with everything that you are dealing with your own life. Let's forget about David. Let's forget about his man. With everything you are dealing with, everything that you are going through, what is influencing your love for God? What is your motivation? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is your motivation? Are you just stay holding to the message because you don't want uh you know uh to make your parents to feel bad? Are you just holding on because uh uh uh I mean uh are you are you are you really at a breaking point that it looks like everything has failed you in this life or you don't even know or are you at a place that you can say I don't even know what is holding me I can't even understand how do I come back. Sometimes I feel like giving up, but I don't understand. There is just something in my heart. Something keeps holding me. If we can play there. Something keeps holding me. [singing] Every day I [singing] see helping me faithfully to overcome [music] my trials. [music] He's guiding me [singing] constantly, giving me victory. [singing] is a [music and singing] reality. Something keeps holding me. [music] Let's sing that now. Something keeps holding [singing] me. Every day I see helping me faithfully to [music] overcome my [singing] trials. He's got [music and singing] it constantly giving me [music] victory [singing] to me is a [music] reality and something keeps holding me. Yes. Something keeps holding [music and singing] me. Every day I [music and singing] see helping me faithfully [music] to overcome my trials. He's guiding [music and singing] me constantly, giving me [music] to [music] my reality and something keeps [singing] holding me. Do you feel like that? That there is something that is holding you. &gt;&gt; Do you feel a talk on the other side that something keeps drawing you closer? In all of your life struggle, in all of what looks like failures and defeat and the things that you are going through, you feel that in your heart that there is something that keeps holding me. There is something that keeps drawing me closer. It's not like something you trying to control and you know you make your choice when you want to and when you don't want to. You know it's something that's keep drawing you closer. Something that is keep pulling you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you feel like that? Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean that's that just that just what service is all about. &gt;&gt; That's what service is all about. It's at the place where we come to the place and uh you know we can be able to uh recommmit ourself to the Lord and look at our our commitment and look at our devotion and look at what what what are we taking what what are we taking above our love for his word? Are we convinced that there's a millennial coming? Are we convinced that there is a rapture? Are we convinced of the promises that he has given us? Are we so convinced of it? Are we convinced of this coming king that has come down in our hearts? Sometimes we get these [music] things all fixed in our mind. We put our life on this on this uh you know and and sometimes we want to put our service on for God on hold until I can get this thing done until this thing can be done then I will get [music] you know really get into the things of God and and uh but I mean it's it's our life. is our life. These were men of light passion. They were going through all of these things. They makes mistakes. [music] They make wrong choices. But yet they come back to the place and realize. Let's just speak to the Lord together while the music [music] plays softly. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we want to thank you this uh afternoon Lord God, you have given us this time.
