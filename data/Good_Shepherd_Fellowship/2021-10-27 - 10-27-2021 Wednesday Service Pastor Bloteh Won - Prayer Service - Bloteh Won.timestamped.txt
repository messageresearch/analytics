[25:26] are not part of this world praise the
[25:28] lord a man kovac is here but kovic is
[25:31] not part of us

[25:59] and then all of that so we just want to
[26:01] encourage you when you come through the
[26:03] door you know all of those things
[26:05] standing down there with anybody to just
[26:07] be decoration or furniture they are
[26:09] bought to be used
[26:10] don't feel bad if you think you are
[26:12] using all you know uh
[26:15] there's just no way you can bathe with
[26:17] it so just clean your hands when you go
[26:19] out you come in you know we stay uh
[26:22] shake hands with one another we stay
[26:24] embrace one another so let's let's make
[26:27] it a habit praise the lord we are doing
[26:30] the best and we will leave the lord to
[26:32] do the rest but let's do our part
[26:36] and
[26:37] and just because of you know all the
[26:40] different
[26:41] you know uh uh uh
[26:44] family and different things that have
[26:45] been sick
[26:47] uh uh
[26:49] we just thought that we would spend a
[26:51] time to to pray tonight
[26:53] uh
[26:54] we have brother brother thomas fed he
[26:57] actually flew into to be with brother
[27:00] paul this weekend but they don't have uh
[27:03] uh
[27:04] they don't have uh
[27:06] wednesday service
[27:09] so uh
[27:10] but he called me while he was coming
[27:12] into the twin city and i did not know
[27:15] that we would be in a situation like
[27:17] this but when i spoke to him i told him
[27:19] i'm not very sure because my mind was
[27:22] just going in many different directions
[27:24] and
[27:25] whether we should cancel the wednesday
[27:27] service and all of that
[27:30] but then as i was thinking about it and
[27:32] praying about it my my question is how
[27:35] many times in a year will we when we
[27:37] cancel service praise the lord
[27:40] and and and even at a time where we
[27:42] cancel service and stay at home you know
[27:45] uh uh
[27:47] you will find yourself just going back
[27:49] to regular things if you just stay home
[27:51] on wednesday night if there was no
[27:53] service dream tonight you would just go
[27:56] back to regular things
[27:57] praise the lord now one man come
[28:00] together tonight and just put our house
[28:03] before the lord and pray for one another
[28:05] and pray for those that are sick and
[28:07] just ask the lord lord live this thing
[28:09] from over our assembling leave these
[28:11] things from us praise the lord amen
[28:15] so uh
[28:17] [Music]

[28:50] different ones brother hillary sent me a
[28:53] text

[28:57] think he and his family went
[28:59] down over to the urgent care i think
[29:02] they want to get tested and all of that
[29:04] that's a good thing to do if you if you
[29:06] if you you want to do that just to get
[29:09] uh doubts from over your mind and
[29:13] we all know uh we we taught ourselves
[29:16] that we're not going to play any

[1:21:46] cause
[1:21:47] god knows why
[1:21:49] i have to come this way this time
[1:21:52] although my friend was
[1:21:54] thinking oh
[1:21:55] there's no opportunity to maybe to
[1:21:57] preach but uh it is prayer meeting but
[1:22:00] it's good that i'm here also to join you
[1:22:02] in praying
[1:22:03] so all things working for good and i
[1:22:05] love the lord

[1:22:10] it is time of mourning we mourn together
[1:22:12] yeah and when it's time of joy we

[1:22:21] christ
[1:22:24] bro one has been a good friend
[1:22:26] some of you the old folks maybe you know
[1:22:28] my face i was with you in one of your
[1:22:30] meetings your convention and
[1:22:33] i have really visited him

[1:22:40] hotel
[1:22:41] and he sent me away
[1:22:43] and being a very good friend

[1:22:47] received me again just to come and
[1:22:48] fellowship with you in this prayer
[1:22:50] meeting
[1:22:51] and we believe that lord will answer us
[1:22:56] okay just to exalt you with some calls
[1:22:59] and some bible so that we go into the
[1:23:01] prayer
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:04] problem was saying something here in the
[1:23:07] province word he said and let those that
[1:23:09] have prayer card stand for prayer now
[1:23:13] as universal
[1:23:14] we pray for the people
[1:23:17] now we want you to know
[1:23:20] you that is standing with prayer card
[1:23:23] is there any doubt in your life
[1:23:28] is there any pardon
[1:23:32] is there any pardon me
[1:23:35] any sin in your life
[1:23:37] that you have not confessed
[1:23:40] if there is
[1:23:42] let me ask you
[1:23:44] this
[1:23:45] don't come into the prayer land
[1:23:48] with unconfessing in your heart
[1:23:52] because
[1:23:54] this is the children's bread
[1:23:56] you see
[1:23:58] and if you are not a christian
[1:24:01] surrender your life to christ
[1:24:04] in the prayer line
[1:24:07] then come
[1:24:08] it is for the believer
[1:24:12] will you do it
[1:24:13] accept him first as your savior
[1:24:16] and then come across a
[1:24:18] platform to be prayed for
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:27] christ the mystery of god revealed the
[1:24:29] prophet said
[1:24:31] we have satan's answer
[1:24:35] god has vindicated himself
[1:24:39] god has proved himself
[1:24:42] to his promise in this day hallelujah
[1:24:46] the hardship is here
[1:24:48] amen christ
[1:24:51] the risen lord
[1:24:53] he is here in the same power of his
[1:24:56] resurrection
[1:24:58] manifesting himself
[1:25:01] that is the devil's answer
[1:25:06] there's a reason
[1:25:07] when this man sitting right here dropped
[1:25:10] dead
[1:25:11] on the other day
[1:25:13] sitting right here
[1:25:14] we could we could say come back
[1:25:18] life because the holy ghost said so
[1:25:23] that's why
[1:25:25] he could do
[1:25:26] to that little
[1:25:28] baby
[1:25:29] yonder in mexico
[1:25:33] had been dead for about 15 hours
[1:25:36] when the vision came and said call it
[1:25:39] back
[1:25:41] and i said let the little baby leave yes
[1:25:46] and the baby that the doctors has wrote
[1:25:48] a statement died
[1:25:50] at nine o'clock
[1:25:52] that morning
[1:25:53] and 11 o'clock
[1:25:55] that night
[1:25:56] come back to life
[1:25:58] he's living today
[1:26:01] hallelujah
[1:26:03] that is we have the devil's answer
[1:26:10] the brother said
[1:26:12] jeremiah in the battle of gilead
[1:26:15] jeremiah
[1:26:16] many hundreds of years ago
[1:26:19] was commanded of jehovah to stand in the
[1:26:22] gates of the city and ask this question
[1:26:27] is there no birmingham
[1:26:30] or is there no physician there
[1:26:33] the question is
[1:26:35] why then
[1:26:36] he said is my daughter the daughter of
[1:26:39] my people not recovered
[1:26:42] the word why
[1:26:45] god
[1:26:46] asked that question
[1:26:48] when god
[1:26:50] has made a way for people to escape
[1:26:53] danger
[1:26:55] or to escape sickness
[1:26:57] or to escape troubles
[1:27:00] or to escape the diseases
[1:27:03] provides a way of escape
[1:27:06] and the people turn it down and refuse
[1:27:08] it
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:10] then god asks why
[1:27:15] what is the reason
[1:27:17] that
[1:27:18] you don't accept it
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:24] just reading some quotes
[1:27:26] just to help us to know where we are
[1:27:28] standing
[1:27:32] so it is today
[1:27:35] that many people die
[1:27:37] in front of the church
[1:27:40] on the steps
[1:27:41] in the pigs
[1:27:43] die in their sins because they refuse to
[1:27:46] accept god's bomb that is in gilly
[1:27:50] they die in their sins because they
[1:27:52] refuse it not because there isn't any
[1:27:55] death
[1:27:56] but they just refuse to take it
[1:27:59] then
[1:28:01] what will they take
[1:28:03] they have to test something false
[1:28:06] instead
[1:28:07] it is not because there is no death
[1:28:11] is because there is black men and women
[1:28:14] just refuse to take it
[1:28:16] and they die
[1:28:18] die in the church set in the meeting and
[1:28:21] listen
[1:28:22] night after night to inspire
[1:28:25] that inspired prophet of god
[1:28:29] who must take the word fearlessly
[1:28:32] and lay it out
[1:28:34] he must be born again men and women sit
[1:28:37] in the pews and die
[1:28:40] and sing into the utter despair
[1:28:43] and annihilated from god not because
[1:28:46] there is no grace and salvation but
[1:28:49] because they refuse to accept it
[1:28:57] in preparation
[1:28:59] to you holy people
[1:29:02] his righteous indignation got up
[1:29:06] that's just you're speaking of shanghai
[1:29:10] i hope
[1:29:11] yours does too tonight let your
[1:29:14] righteous integration rise up
[1:29:17] get up against the evil
[1:29:22] get up against that old wheelchair

[1:29:29] one of them will strike on them
[1:29:32] don't have to have them
[1:29:35] no sir
[1:29:36] they don't belong to you
[1:29:39] christ said
[1:29:41] should not this daughter be loosed on
[1:29:45] the sabbath day being bound with the
[1:29:48] devil all these years
[1:29:57] just once more
[1:29:59] he said
[1:30:00] a woman said
[1:30:02] i have a right
[1:30:04] to do what i want to do
[1:30:06] that is an american privilege
[1:30:11] it is your american privilege
[1:30:14] it arranges your god-given privilege
[1:30:18] though
[1:30:19] a goat will always kick up and fuse
[1:30:23] but a sheep stand still and fulfill its
[1:30:27] rights you see
[1:30:29] if you are a real child of god you will
[1:30:31] fulfill your american right
[1:30:34] to the holy spirit and let him move you
[1:30:38] and make you like you should be
[1:30:42] [Music]

[1:30:47] now we find him
[1:30:49] as soon as god came upon him

[1:30:56] and out after 40 years
[1:31:00] and defeated satan
[1:31:03] by the word of god
[1:31:05] what did he do
[1:31:07] he brought
[1:31:09] he brought
[1:31:11] in the divine promise
[1:31:13] in the rich
[1:31:15] of the weakest of christians
[1:31:21] if he was god
[1:31:23] why did he let satan say if there be the
[1:31:27] son of god perform a miracle here and
[1:31:30] show me you can do it
[1:31:33] turn these stones into bread and eat
[1:31:36] he said it is written
[1:31:39] man shall not leave by bread alone
[1:31:42] so then as satan always tried to quote
[1:31:46] just to cover to quote the word
[1:31:49] went back and told him
[1:31:52] when he put him in the pinnacle
[1:31:56] of the temple
[1:31:57] again he said it is written
[1:32:00] and he defeated satan on the word of god
[1:32:05] that showed that
[1:32:07] you can defeat satan on the word of god
[1:32:12] no matter
[1:32:14] the word of god will defeat satan any
[1:32:17] place anywhere under any condition
[1:32:22] if it is in the belly even in the belly
[1:32:26] of a whale
[1:32:28] even in the lion's den
[1:32:30] if it is on the bed with cancer
[1:32:34] or it is lying younger bleeding to death
[1:32:38] in an automobile accident
[1:32:41] the word of god will defeat satan
[1:32:44] anywhere
[1:32:45] even the weakest christian can use it
[1:32:49] it is your god give him privilege
[1:32:53] if somebody prepared to use it
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:59] the prophet said you as a christian god
[1:33:02] has given you a sword
[1:33:04] but if you don't know how to hold it
[1:33:05] somebody will stick or beat you
[1:33:08] somebody will stick he is holding stick
[1:33:10] but he will defeat you
[1:33:12] the reason is this because you don't
[1:33:13] know how to use the sword
[1:33:17] it is time for us to know let the sword
[1:33:20] fit our hands
[1:33:23] and let us know how to drive it
[1:33:25] right because it was a way it's a combat
[1:33:29] we must know how to drag the sword into
[1:33:31] the enemy's heart
[1:33:34] satan is just a brother brother
[1:33:36] as long as calvary is still flesh the
[1:33:39] blood of jesus is the flesh brother we
[1:33:41] have the antelope we have the solution
[1:33:45] we should not be afraid of his threat
[1:33:47] and his or whatever he doing
[1:33:52] the prophet said
[1:33:54] even the slim policeman on the road the
[1:33:57] whole america is behind him he has got
[1:33:59] authority to stop that big car that is
[1:34:02] pulling on the road he said you have you
[1:34:05] have also been giving that authority
[1:34:08] when satan is throwing sickness against
[1:34:10] us will help everyone say satan stop
[1:34:12] there
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:16] be have authority brother we should not
[1:34:18] be afraid because god has given us power
[1:34:22] and that problem might be exercised
[1:34:27] that is your position in christ
[1:34:31] heavenly places in christ jesus amen
[1:34:34] that is your security praise
[1:34:37] so those brothers and sisters that has
[1:34:39] really cut that discovery brother coffee
[1:34:42] don't know coffee what you know is
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:58] let me read this one and i give the
[1:34:59] prophet to the pastor
[1:35:01] faith is our victory
[1:35:03] he said
[1:35:05] now
[1:35:06] faith
[1:35:08] is a conqueror
[1:35:11] faith is a conqueror
[1:35:15] it just isn't a peacemaker
[1:35:18] it overcomes
[1:35:21] faith doesn't make any peace with them
[1:35:22] we don't make peace with satan
[1:35:26] we have to conquer him
[1:35:28] praise the lord
[1:35:31] what is it
[1:35:32] to conquer
[1:35:34] conquer and victory is the same
[1:35:38] to conquer it means to beat down
[1:35:42] to override
[1:35:44] to hank off
[1:35:46] to throw into prison
[1:35:49] it means that the sin that once ruled
[1:35:53] you
[1:35:54] you rule it now
[1:35:57] it means that
[1:35:58] you have overcome it
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:02] you have quipped it
[1:36:04] yes
[1:36:05] you have
[1:36:06] you you are greater than it eight
[1:36:10] i feel religious now
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:13] which was first
[1:36:14] a sinner or a savior
[1:36:17] it was a savior
[1:36:20] for a savior is more powerful than a sin
[1:36:25] which is first the healer
[1:36:28] or a sickness
[1:36:30] it couldn't be
[1:36:33] less he was over the sickness it is a
[1:36:36] healer
[1:36:38] it can conquer the sickness
[1:36:43] and faith is the victory that overcomes
[1:36:47] every case
[1:36:49] of the devil
[1:36:51] faith is the victory
[1:36:53] faith is what yes
[1:36:55] not faith in your church
[1:36:58] no faith in your creed no faith in some
[1:37:01] men
[1:37:02] but faith in jesus christ who made the
[1:37:06] promise
[1:37:08] that is the victory what is it it is the
[1:37:12] victory see my arm is still crippled by
[1:37:16] faith is the victory
[1:37:18] i still feels sick
[1:37:21] but faith is the victory
[1:37:24] it overcomes the world
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:32] that is our position
[1:37:37] so why
[1:37:39] we are going to pray then the pastor
[1:37:41] will take over and then
[1:37:42] lead us into prayer brother
[1:37:45] do not look at
[1:37:47] the circumstances
[1:37:49] don't look at the environment
[1:37:51] don't look at the opposition
[1:37:54] don't look at the challenge
[1:37:56] look at your victory
[1:37:58] it is not today you are going to get the
[1:38:00] victory
[1:38:01] it's not today if it is today it means
[1:38:04] you don't know what is in stock for you
[1:38:07] but you are victorious
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:12] you see those days that we go to the
[1:38:14] cinema
[1:38:15] the cinema that you have really watched
[1:38:17] before and then you sit with somebody
[1:38:18] and then maybe the blues leave you know
[1:38:20] those and then they'll be beating
[1:38:22] oh they're beating
[1:38:24] that one that that's what you watch at
[1:38:26] the end of it you see this man that is
[1:38:28] down will rise and defeat the killer
[1:38:31] that's how it is we know the end of the
[1:38:33] cinema
[1:38:34] we know the end of this movie jesus
[1:38:38] christ has already defeated satan
[1:38:41] so if the battle is really saturated we
[1:38:44] fear not yes he will blow you down he
[1:38:48] will kick you down don't put the
[1:38:50] ventilator on you they will do this to
[1:38:52] you but you know the end of death
[1:38:56] we know the end of the picture
[1:38:58] victory
[1:39:00] for a child of god
[1:39:03] there's no way that the son of god will
[1:39:06] be defeated
[1:39:08] if jesus was defeated then the son of
[1:39:10] god can be defeated today
[1:39:14] abram said we stand co equal
