[45:48] so he went and did according to the word
[45:50] of the lord for he went and dwelt by the
[45:54] brook of cherith
[45:56] that is before jordan and the ravens
[45:58] brought him bread and flesh in the
[46:01] morning and bread and
[46:03] and flesh in the evening and he drank of
[46:06] the brook
[46:07] and it came to pass after a while that
[46:09] the brook dried up
[46:11] because there had been no rain
[46:14] in the land

[46:34] verse
[46:35] 8
[46:38] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[46:40] neither are your ways my way saith the
[46:43] lord for as the heavens are higher than
[46:45] the earth so are my ways higher than
[46:49] your ways and my thoughts than your
[46:52] thoughts
[46:53] amen may the lord bless reading of his
[46:55] word you can have your seats
[47:00] amen praise the lord
[47:04] tonight by the
[47:06] grace of god i want to
[47:08] use for a
[47:11] a title perfect timing
[47:14] but my
[47:15] inspiration is the path of faith
[47:18] perfect timing
[47:20] the path of faith
[47:22] you know
[47:24] church as we serve the lord
[47:28] you know we have to understand that you
[47:30] know in this world
[47:32] everything is changing
[47:35] everything it seems like there's so much
[47:37] adversity and so many things that are
[47:40] taking place but
[47:41] while we see all those things one thing
[47:44] stands assured is that god doesn't
[47:46] change
[47:48] that god remains the same
[47:50] you know he he whatever god has given to
[47:53] the believer is still there as long as
[47:55] you believe that he is
[47:58] you know if the scriptures say that god
[48:00] is a rewarder to those that
[48:02] diligently seek him amen and you know i
[48:04] think in this time and hour that we have
[48:06] to be diligent when it comes to the
[48:08] things of god
[48:10] but you know when we think about the
[48:11] mind of god sometimes it it leaves us
[48:14] baffled i don't know about you but it it
[48:16] baffles me sometimes when i think about
[48:19] the mind of god because
[48:21] you know when you think about the
[48:22] leading of god and how things happen you
[48:25] know i don't know about you but
[48:26] sometimes i ask myself lord why am i
[48:29] doing this or why am i going this way or
[48:31] why did this happen or why that happened
[48:33] remember
[48:34] the scripture says that
[48:36] his thoughts are not our faults amen his
[48:39] ways are higher than our ways amen so
[48:42] you know uh uh when it comes to our life
[48:45] our life is being ordered and directed
[48:48] by god amen
[48:49] so that's what we rest in we rest
[48:52] in what we should rest in we should rest
[48:55] knowing that god is in control amen
[48:58] you know but when we when we think how
[49:00] things happen and why it happened and
[49:02] sometimes it looks
[49:04] like it's it's so detrimental to
[49:07] whatever the moment is at that time
[49:10] but we have to fall back and say
[49:12] god is in control
[49:14] you know the prophet of god he preached
[49:15] a message called be certain of god amen
[49:19] and though there are times in our life
[49:21] where our faith will be tried and we
[49:24] have to be certain
[49:26] that god is still god
[49:28] amen you know god did that all
[49:30] throughout the scriptures
[49:32] it looked like there was no way out many
[49:34] times for the believers but that
[49:36] believer had to be certain of god
[49:39] think about it church god came to noah
[49:41] and he told noah it's gonna rain and i'm
[49:44] gonna give you instructions to build a
[49:46] boat but he didn't tell him how long he
[49:48] was gonna take
[49:49] so noah had to be certain that it was
[49:52] god giving him the pattern to build this
[49:55] boat hallelujah he couldn't use his own
[49:57] thoughts he couldn't use his own ways
[50:00] and he had to believe that the timing of
[50:02] what he was doing was perfect
[50:04] hallelujah he had to believe that amen
[50:07] i'm walking by faith i'm in the path of
[50:09] faith and god is in control hallelujah
[50:12] think about it he may have had troubles
[50:14] and adversity with his children but he
[50:16] had to say god is in control you know
[50:19] his marriage may have gotten a little
[50:21] tight or a little frustrated at times
[50:23] but he had to say god is in control now
[50:26] he couldn't explain it hallelujah
[50:29] no one couldn't explain it he couldn't
[50:30] say you know uh
[50:33] i don't know why i need to use this
[50:35] pitch i don't know why i need to use the
[50:36] sheet of wood and all these things
[50:38] because if you soak it it's gonna it's
[50:40] gonna sink
[50:42] the very thing god was using him that
[50:45] was making judgment proof to the natural
[50:48] eye it was no good
[50:50] but he could use his own reasoning why
[50:52] because it was god's thoughts
[50:54] [Music]
[50:56] hallelujah
[50:57] go ahead
[50:59] i feel my helper coming off
[51:01] hallelujah church church look he told
[51:04] him i want you to get some sheamwood
[51:06] hallelujah ceiling board the very thing
[51:09] uh uh or gopher wood what we call it the
[51:12] very thing that looked like you put it
[51:14] in water and it would just sink to the
[51:16] bottom god said i'm gonna use that to
[51:19] deliver you amen think about the church
[51:22] now y'all know my testimony i had cancer
[51:24] in my brain god used cancer to
[51:29] [Music]
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:31] [Music]
[51:32] god used cancer to deliver me hallelujah
[51:36] because before that time i didn't know
[51:38] the lord so god allowed situations that
[51:42] i couldn't explain how you come into my
[51:44] life and put me into the path of faith
[51:48] why because it was god's thoughts it was
[51:51] god's time in hallelujah you say 15
[51:53] years old yeah it was his time and amen
[51:57] hallelujah
[52:00] church i'm like david brother i'm like
[52:02] david tonight i got to encourage myself
[52:06] because i'm going through something but
[52:08] i got to encourage myself
[52:11] hallelujah
[52:12] oh my church think about that david went
[52:15] out to fight a battle i know i ain't
[52:16] read these scriptures but we're gonna go
[52:18] with it hallelujah david went out to
[52:20] fight a battle and then david came back
[52:22] his wives were gone the children were
[52:24] gone and even all his men their wives
[52:26] and children were gone but the scripture
[52:28] said nobody was dead and nobody was hurt
[52:33] church don't worry about what you see in
[52:34] your family nobody is dead and nobody is
[52:37] hurt
[52:39] god is in control hallelujah it got to
[52:41] the point where the people were so upset
[52:43] with david they thought about stoning
[52:46] david holly the very man who had a had a
[52:49] heart like god
[52:50] and now all of a sudden the people
[52:52] didn't turn on david they would say you
[52:54] know what i got to do i got to encourage
[52:56] myself
[52:58] people would bounce around people will
[53:00] say i don't believe the message no more
[53:02] it's time for you to encourage yourself
[53:06] see i don't fuss and fight trying to
[53:08] prove this message to people i just live
[53:10] in hallelujah amen because i know what i
[53:13] used to be i know where i came from
[53:15] hallelujah and if this message ain't
[53:17] real what changed me then
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:22] [Music]
[53:24] whoa
[53:25] because i saw within the baptist church
[53:27] i still wasn't in the pentecostal church
[53:30] i was sitting here listening to message
[53:31] preachers preaching from malachi 4 and
[53:34] that changed my life
[53:37] it's the revelation of the thing
[53:40] see they're trying to put it on a man
[53:42] from kentucky no it was god's thoughts
[53:46] hallelujah
[53:49] and god's timing is perfect
[53:51] and you think about a church
[53:53] you you you go through things and and
[53:55] sometimes you ask the question why or
[53:57] why me you know god is in control
[54:02] sometimes hallelujah
[54:04] god allow us to go through things
[54:06] so he can express himself
[54:11] god let your finances get tight so he
[54:14] can express himself
[54:16] so he can show you hurry he owns a
[54:18] cattle a thousand hills

[1:05:50] we might as well stick with it
[1:05:51] hallelujah by the grace of god
[1:05:53] hallelujah but church you think about
[1:05:55] noah hallelujah now he's building and
[1:05:57] building buildings and and he doesn't
[1:05:59] have a clue of how long he has to stick
[1:06:02] with this vision
[1:06:05] it doesn't matter all the ridicule all
[1:06:07] the persecution all the things he had to
[1:06:09] go through he had to stick with the
[1:06:11] vision harley and now his family is a
[1:06:13] part of the team he's building and
[1:06:14] building and building the building
[1:06:15] hallelujah 10 years later the vision
[1:06:18] remains the same yeah that's right
[1:06:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:22] 20 years later the vision remains the
[1:06:25] same
[1:06:26] the boys are not little babies anymore
[1:06:28] harlem now they're young men hallelujah
[1:06:30] and they've gotten so in tune with the
[1:06:32] vision they went and grabbed wives
[1:06:34] hardly and they brought wives home and
[1:06:37] made them a part of the vision
[1:06:39] that's why i tell you young people when
[1:06:41] you marry you marry someone that can
[1:06:43] stay with your vision
[1:06:46] you marry someone that can see what you
[1:06:48] see hallelujah because if they can't see
[1:06:51] what you see they can't be a part of
[1:06:53] your vision
[1:06:56] oh yeah
[1:06:57] look they had to marry some wives that
[1:06:59] were going to help build on that boat
[1:07:05] hey
[1:07:06] whether it was just sitting there for
[1:07:08] moral support say hunting you the best
[1:07:09] hammer i ever seen
[1:07:12] honey you're the best wood you're the
[1:07:14] best wood bringer i've ever seen
[1:07:17] you're the best sapporo i've ever seen
[1:07:20] whether she was there for support or or
[1:07:22] whatever physically getting into it she
[1:07:25] had to be there to stay in the vision
[1:07:28] she couldn't be somebody sitting back on
[1:07:30] the outside saying these people crazy
[1:07:34] ain't nobody
[1:07:35] why they building a boat that big we got
[1:07:37] a boat right over here
[1:07:39] she had to be somebody who wasn't gonna
[1:07:43] uh deal with her own reasoning holly
[1:07:46] well i know brother branham said this
[1:07:48] but but uh i don't think we got to do
[1:07:51] all that
[1:07:55] you know he made mistakes yeah he did as
[1:07:57] a man but not when it comes to the word
[1:07:58] of god
[1:08:02] we all make mistakes as men and women
[1:08:04] hollywood but when it comes to the word
[1:08:06] of god what you have to realize this
[1:08:08] message of the hour wasn't brother
[1:08:10] branham's thoughts
[1:08:12] hallelujah
[1:08:13] because there were many times how you
[1:08:15] just take the seals for example
[1:08:17] hallelujah he was saying at the white
[1:08:19] house right it was christ hallelujah
[1:08:20] that was his thoughts and then god came
[1:08:23] and put him all alone and said hey let
[1:08:25] me show you what you're looking at
[1:08:26] that's right
[1:08:29] oh but god did god open the curtain god
[1:08:32] pulled a curtain back and he said look
[1:08:34] into my mind
[1:08:38] hallelujah
[1:08:40] think about it church what are we seeing
[1:08:42] when we see this message of the hour
[1:08:43] we're looking in the mind of god
[1:08:49] not only that but we're living out god's
[1:08:51] thoughts
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:54] so how could you ever be defeated
[1:08:57] living according to god's thoughts in
[1:08:59] his mind
[1:09:01] you think god is having thoughts of
[1:09:03] defeat
[1:09:06] oh i feel encouraged brother juan
[1:09:10] holy
[1:09:11] church 120 years later now
[1:09:13] hallelujah he says no in his family he
[1:09:15] says y'all go get in the boat
[1:09:18] and then they start seeing earlier
[1:09:20] animals come by too they couldn't
[1:09:22] explain it
[1:09:23] hallelujah you know they probably seen
[1:09:25] lions and tigers and all these things
[1:09:27] coming in the boat they couldn't explain
[1:09:29] it oh yeah now realize what i want you
[1:09:32] to realize
[1:09:33] at that time
[1:09:34] the lion harley was still in an
[1:09:37] unconverted state
[1:09:38] it was still a wild beast
[1:09:41] but when it came into god's vision it
[1:09:43] was tangled
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] oh yeah
[1:09:48] you know bears were on that boat you
[1:09:50] know what the grizzly he was tame
[1:09:52] hallelujah
[1:09:54] any wild animal you could think of in
[1:09:56] the jungle hallelujah it was tame when
[1:09:58] it came on that boat why because it was
[1:10:00] god holy you know they stepped into an
[1:10:03] atmosphere of god holy
[1:10:06] church amen bring your troubles to
[1:10:08] church
[1:10:10] put it in the atmosphere of the holy
[1:10:11] ghost
[1:10:12] and see if god won't tame it
[1:10:15] see if god won't deal with it
[1:10:17] see if god hurry up won't change the
[1:10:20] whole situation
[1:10:22] don't walk out of here the same way you
[1:10:24] came in give it to god
[1:10:26] that's the only reason why god allows
[1:10:28] you to come on the ark
[1:10:40] now let's get to my message
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:44] oh yeah now you look at elijah don't get
[1:10:47] nervous ain't gonna be too much longer
[1:10:50] now you look at elijah hallelujah elijah
[1:10:53] comes down was elijah not a prophet
[1:10:55] we're talking about perfect timing now
[1:10:57] he likes it he comes down hollywood he
[1:11:00] tells ahab and jezebel and all he said
[1:11:02] you know what it ain't gonna rain to our
[1:11:04] call forward
[1:11:05] why did he do that god told him to do it
[1:11:09] oh if god tells you to do anything you
[1:11:12] better believe god gonna back it up
[1:11:16] see the problem we got nowadays
[1:11:18] we have too many people
[1:11:20] doing things based upon their own desire
[1:11:25] whether it comes to
[1:11:26] going to church or starting the church
[1:11:28] or preaching the gospel or whatever it
[1:11:30] is
[1:11:31] they say they do it in the name of the
[1:11:32] lord
[1:11:34] but most of the time people are doing it
[1:11:36] according to their own desire
[1:11:38] and there's nothing wrong with wanting
[1:11:40] to do something for god just make sure
[1:11:42] it's in his plan
[1:11:44] it's in his will hallelujah because
[1:11:46] remember david wanted to do something
[1:11:48] for god david wanted to build god a big
[1:11:51] old temple big old uh uh palace
[1:11:54] hallelujah but god told him say no david
[1:11:57] you can't i can't let you do it your
[1:11:59] hand is shed too much blood i'm gonna
[1:12:00] let your son do it huh he had the right
[1:12:02] desire but he wasn't the one that was
[1:12:04] supposed to do it
[1:12:05] and you know what holy that's our
[1:12:07] problem sometimes we can't surrender our
[1:12:10] desire to the person that's really
[1:12:11] supposed to do it amen
[1:12:15] can you imagine me saying hallelujah all
[1:12:17] those years i came here preaching before
[1:12:19] brother juan got here hallelujah and now
[1:12:22] hallelujah amen brother the different
[1:12:25] brothers invite me up amen and we're

[1:12:52] that god brings you a pastor what if i
[1:12:54] had the desire to be the pastor
[1:12:57] but i wasn't the one that was supposed
[1:12:58] to be the pastor
[1:13:00] and that's what happens a lot of times
[1:13:02] people hardly they they use cert
[1:13:04] authority hallelujah but what god did
[1:13:07] hallelujah god brought a man hallelujah
[1:13:09] all the way hallelujah for miles and
[1:13:11] miles and miles away harley y'all know
[1:13:13] he had to come because his bride was
[1:13:15] here
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:22] oh y'all thought y'all was just getting
[1:13:23] a good church member no she had to come
[1:13:26] to draw him away
[1:13:28] [Music]
[1:13:31] [Applause]
[1:13:34] that man said i can't stay back with my
[1:13:36] bride all the way over there i got to go
[1:13:39] holy what was it was god's plan
[1:13:42] hallelujah
[1:13:44] oh my church you see how god works god
[1:13:46] just god he does things amen and all
[1:13:49] natural minds can't even can't even
[1:13:50] fathom what's going on
[1:13:53] hallelujah but look church and you think
[1:13:55] about how god did that amen he worked it
[1:13:58] all out amen and now look at him
[1:14:01] you look at it was a sovereign work of
[1:14:03] god
[1:14:06] some of y'all would even be in this
[1:14:08] church if brother juan wasn't here
[1:14:14] was it it was the vision
[1:14:16] it was the vision of god
[1:14:18] god said i got to get him here honey to
[1:14:21] get him here and get her here and get
[1:14:23] these here you see all of you were
[1:14:25] connected to this vision
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:30] we started with that vision hallelujah
[1:14:34] hello
[1:14:35] and you know the law of putting all
[1:14:36] these things in place hallelujah putting
[1:14:38] all these different things in place why
[1:14:40] to get us all in the same vision
[1:14:44] hallelujah
[1:14:46] amen you look church now elijah
[1:14:48] hallelujah he says hey it ain't gonna
[1:14:50] rain to our call for us and you notice
[1:14:53] church what happened
[1:14:55] god told him after he did some
[1:14:56] supernatural he said not gonna run for
[1:14:59] your life
[1:15:04] think about that church
[1:15:06] you're just trying to do what god wants
[1:15:07] you to do and everything falls apart
[1:15:12] everything falls apart can't break down
[1:15:13] just have the house mess up children
[1:15:16] spouses
[1:15:17] everything mess up but all you're doing
[1:15:19] is you doing what god said lord i'm
[1:15:20] doing what you told me to do
[1:15:23] what is he doing he's making you perfect
[1:15:27] he's proving you hallelujah
[1:15:29] see what god does to get the best out of
[1:15:32] you he has to let you experience
[1:15:34] adversity
[1:15:35] holy because it's adversity which makes
[1:15:38] the thing perfect huh
[1:15:39] you know church these chairs hallelujah
[1:15:41] had to be tested
[1:15:44] hallelujah before you could buy them
[1:15:46] from wherever you bought them from they
[1:15:47] had to be tested they had to be approved
[1:15:49] to be able to hold a certain amount of
[1:15:51] weight hallelujah they didn't just put
[1:15:53] it together and through it i didn't know
[1:15:54] it had to be tested hungry and that's
[1:15:57] what god is doing to us you're not gonna
[1:15:59] get to heaven without being tested
[1:16:01] hallelujah you're not gonna make it
[1:16:03] harder you gotta be tested amen you're
[1:16:05] gonna have to walk a path of faith
[1:16:07] hunger up
[1:16:08] and you're not gonna be able to
[1:16:09] understand everything you just go out
[1:16:11] and say well god i believe you in
[1:16:12] control
[1:16:14] holy
[1:16:15] there were people all throughout the
[1:16:17] scriptures hallelujah who couldn't
[1:16:19] understand what they was doing but they
[1:16:21] did it that's right
[1:16:26] and you fail to realize hallelujah
[1:16:29] that that trial hallelujah
[1:16:31] the the name of the trial we we we we
[1:16:35] misnamed the trial sometimes
[1:16:37] we're like i'm going through this i'm
[1:16:38] going through that and this happened
[1:16:39] that happened really what you're going
[1:16:41] through is a move of grace
[1:16:45] hell yeah
[1:16:46] it's a move of grace the path of faith a
[1:16:49] move of grace because look church
[1:16:51] why did god come to noah he said because
[1:16:54] noah found what
[1:16:56] grace
[1:16:58] that big old boat was grace those 120
[1:17:02] years was grace hallelujah all those
[1:17:04] animals on the boat was grace 40 days 40
[1:17:07] nights was grace
[1:17:12] so we look at our trials we have a look
[1:17:14] of it through the vision of god
[1:17:16] because god is not in the plan he's not
[1:17:18] in the business of failure so if you're
[1:17:20] going through something what is he doing
[1:17:22] he's giving you grace
[1:17:24] to become that son that daughter of god
[1:17:26] that he knows you are
[1:17:29] hallelujah
[1:17:30] so what we have to do we have to keep on
[1:17:32] pressing and believing in god
[1:17:35] because his timing is perfect hallelujah
[1:17:38] now you look at elijah
[1:17:40] god tells him he says hey i want you to
[1:17:42] go
[1:17:42] by the brook
[1:17:44] jordan drank over there and i'ma send
[1:17:47] something to sustain you
[1:17:48] now he just did something supernatural
[1:17:50] shut up the heavens ain't gonna be no
[1:17:52] rain that i called for i think it was
[1:17:53] three years something to that effect
[1:17:56] ain't gonna be no rain that i call for
[1:17:58] now he gets over there
[1:18:00] and he says
[1:18:02] i'm gonna send a raven
[1:18:04] to feed you
[1:18:08] look at god
[1:18:11] think about that
[1:18:13] god used something
[1:18:16] with an illegitimate nature
[1:18:19] to sustain the promises of god
[1:18:23] god used something hallelujah that would
[1:18:26] that would do something against its own
[1:18:28] will its own makeup
[1:18:31] to fulfill a promise of god
[1:18:35] oh yeah
[1:18:36] until that time a raven was never
[1:18:39] faithful
[1:18:43] unto that time a raven is nothing more
[1:18:46] than a scavenger that's right nothing
[1:18:48] more than a buzzard
[1:18:50] but now it's operating as a dove
[1:18:55] why because it was the vision of god
[1:18:59] god could take the things that look like
[1:19:00] it's supposed to destroy you and make it
[1:19:03] a blessing in your life
[1:19:06] hallelujah he could take the things that
[1:19:09] look like a curse and make it a blessing
[1:19:11] in your life
[1:19:13] hell yeah he made the he been oh my he
[1:19:16] turned the raven into a pet parrot
[1:19:23] because you go back and read it
[1:19:25] go back and read it
[1:19:27] after the flood when noah was trying to
[1:19:30] figure out what's going on what did he
[1:19:32] do he sent out a raven that's right and
[1:19:34] he sent out a dumb harley he sent out
[1:19:36] the raven the raven was having a good
[1:19:38] old time
[1:19:40] he was out there eating rotting this and
[1:19:42] riding that and bouncing him bouncing
[1:19:44] there's like whoa boy that's a jubilee i
[1:19:46] i've been on this boat for 48 i sure am
[1:19:48] hungry
[1:19:51] he was eating up everything he could eat
[1:19:53] why because that was its nature
[1:19:55] when it went into the boat it would have
[1:19:58] that nature when it came out the boat it
[1:19:59] had that nature he had the nature of a
[1:20:02] raven hunger and if you don't know what
[1:20:04] i'm talking about you ever seen a buzzer
[1:20:07] oh yeah
[1:20:08] a brother hardly eats roadkill hardly
[1:20:11] and he could be on the side of the road
[1:20:13] big old buddy sit there and eat and eat
[1:20:15] and eat till the car starts coming in
[1:20:16] jump out the way
[1:20:18] soon chicago
[1:20:25] buzzard and nature buzzer and raven got
[1:20:27] the same nature
[1:20:30] but you look what god did huh
[1:20:33] god
[1:20:34] changed this nature to fulfill a promise
[1:20:38] god told me
[1:20:44] god can take your hard-hearted boss and
[1:20:46] change his heart and give you a raise
[1:20:49] hallelujah
[1:20:50] hallelujah
[1:20:52] god could take your uh hard-hearted
[1:20:54] family member who's saying you in a cult
[1:20:56] change their heart hurry and let them be
[1:20:59] uh uh
[1:21:00] a family member going to church with
[1:21:02] your husband
[1:21:04] that's right he can do it
[1:21:07] and look the scriptures say you go back
[1:21:08] and read i'm just praying phrase for the
[1:21:10] sake of time but you go back and read
[1:21:12] the church the bible says it bought him
[1:21:14] flesh in the day and in the evening
[1:21:18] that raven was faithful
[1:21:24] god could make the illegitimate things
[1:21:26] faithful
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:29] because that's his vision
[1:21:31] ain't never even stayed there and you
[1:21:33] look you got to be thinking about elijah
[1:21:35] now elijah's sitting there he's the the
[1:21:37] raven bringing him flesh and bread and
[1:21:39] flesh and bread he's drinking out the
[1:21:41] brook and all these things you know he
[1:21:42] probably sitting and saying lord what's
[1:21:44] next i'm doing everything he told me to
[1:21:45] do now i got to see him just be fed by
[1:21:47] bird
[1:21:49] and then the bible says
[1:21:51] the brook dried up
[1:21:53] why did it dry up because he spoke no
[1:21:55] rain
[1:21:57] and that's how the devil gets the devil
[1:21:58] say see if you would have never spoke
[1:22:00] that you have something to drink right

[1:22:19] lies when you live in the world you was
[1:22:21] on your way to hell
[1:22:24] you throw your way to destruction the
[1:22:26] lake of fire honey

[1:22:50] that was the best that was perfect
[1:22:51] timing
[1:22:54] second coming he tell people that man
[1:22:55] when you was in the world you had a good
[1:22:57] job you had deal you had a nice house
[1:22:59] all animals on your way to hell
[1:23:03] that's right

[1:23:09] i wasn't doing that and yeah you wasn't
[1:23:11] doing that on your way to hell
[1:23:16] because one thing you have to realize
[1:23:17] kane wasn't unbelievable
[1:23:21] think about this now
[1:23:23] cain was an unbeliever he wasn't an
[1:23:25] unbeliever so he had righteous
[1:23:27] tendencies
[1:23:31] he grew up in a christian home he knew
[1:23:33] how to offer sacrifice everything he
[1:23:35] believed in god he had some righteous
[1:23:38] tendencies hallelujah but he couldn't
[1:23:40] fully tap into the nature of god
[1:23:44] so we don't want just good righteous
[1:23:46] tendencies i'm able to come to church
[1:23:48] and i'm able to pay my tithes and and
[1:23:50] you know i'm able to sit here and sing i
[1:23:52] raise a hallelujah
[1:23:55] we're able to be here and do these
[1:23:56] things no holy you want to tap into the
[1:23:58] divine nature of god
[1:24:03] well it's not you anymore but it's the
[1:24:05] vision and path of god
[1:24:07] holy that's directing your life
[1:24:09] hallelujah now you're looking you see
[1:24:11] elijah hallelujah now he tells he says
[1:24:13] hey go down to this spot down here i got
[1:24:16] a woman down there who's gonna take care
[1:24:20] hallelujah
[1:24:21] church and look at the mind of god
[1:24:24] hallelujah
[1:24:25] look at the mind of god this man's just
[1:24:27] being obedient everything god god told
[1:24:28] him stop all the rain stop up everything
[1:24:31] he stop it up brook went dry he's like
[1:24:32] oh my god now i got to go someplace else
[1:24:35] but god's using the raven to sustain him
[1:24:38] god using the brook to sustain him now
[1:24:40] the brook then went dry devil bottle
[1:24:42] came in and say see if you wouldn't have
[1:24:43] been speaking that stuff you asked on
[1:24:45] the drink
[1:24:46] and then god said hey i ain't finished
[1:24:48] go on down there there's a widow to take
[1:24:49] care you're going down there
[1:24:51] now look this is when you have to be
[1:24:53] certain of god
[1:24:54] because he gets down there to the widow
[1:24:56] hallelujah
[1:24:58] and he begins to talk to in different
[1:24:59] things and she's like well you know what
[1:25:01] uh
[1:25:02] all i got is just a little bit of meal a
[1:25:04] little bit of oil
[1:25:06] and i'm gonna just eat this we're gonna
[1:25:07] bake a cake and me and my son we're
[1:25:09] gonna die
[1:25:10] and you know what hollywood if elijah
[1:25:12] didn't have an experience with god he'd
[1:25:14] have been dumb right there
[1:25:16] he would have been questioning the lord
[1:25:17] because the lord told him i got a woman
[1:25:19] that's going to sustain you a woman
[1:25:21] that's going to keep you did he get down
[1:25:22] and the woman saying something different
[1:25:25] the woman said she basically like what
[1:25:27] god told you man all i got is just
[1:25:29] enough for two little cakes
[1:25:31] how i'm gonna sustain you
[1:25:33] his ways are not your way
[1:25:36] his thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:25:39] his mind is higher than your mind
[1:25:42] hallelujah
[1:25:43] god ain't looking at what you got he
[1:25:45] knows what he can do and what you got
[1:25:47] that's right hallelujah amen so church
[1:25:50] when we come in situations like that we
[1:25:52] can't approach it with our own mind
[1:25:55] we have to say
[1:25:57] lord what you about to do
[1:26:01] that's what you got to say church if
[1:26:02] you're going through something tonight i
[1:26:04] want you to change your thought process
[1:26:06] and say lord what you
[1:26:14] because god i got some things i'm facing
[1:26:16] and i don't know how i'm gonna face it
[1:26:18] but lord what you about to do
[1:26:20] oh god i know you about to do something
[1:26:22] hallelujah i'm gonna start opening up
[1:26:24] windows and looking at him hallelujah
[1:26:27] he said see if i won't pull you out of
[1:26:29] blessing
[1:26:30] that's so big you won't be able to
[1:26:32] receive it
[1:26:37] that's the god i serve
[1:26:39] church he gets down there this is when
[1:26:41] you got to be certain of god he gets
[1:26:42] down there he says hey you know the lord
[1:26:44] didn't told me to come down here cause
[1:26:45] you gonna help me out you're gonna feed
[1:26:47] me you're gonna take care of me she's
[1:26:48] like
[1:26:50] you sure that was god
[1:26:52] and she please okay she said
[1:26:55] i just got a little bit of oil a little
[1:26:56] bit of meal
[1:26:58] i'm gonna bake a cake for me and my son
[1:26:59] and we gonna die
[1:27:01] and then elijah because he was certain
[1:27:04] of god
[1:27:05] he was in the path of faith
[1:27:08] he was in the right season of god
[1:27:10] and he had already seen god take care of
[1:27:12] him that's right
[1:27:13] teachers that what you have to do to the
[1:27:15] devil
[1:27:16] you have to make the devil remember your
[1:27:18] god
[1:27:19] make him remember what so god has done
[1:27:22] holy remember david didn't just fight

[1:27:41] circumstances
[1:27:43] if he brought you out last time he can
[1:27:45] bring you out again

[1:29:11] your heart might hurt a little bit but
[1:29:13] this
[1:29:14] but this is the uh the uh i'm trying to
[1:29:16] think the right word this is the
[1:29:17] soulless we have if they were a
[1:29:19] christian
[1:29:20] you're gonna see them again
[1:29:23] and i guarantee you harley they be
[1:29:26] saying right now you can give them a

[1:29:29] you can keep that
[1:29:31] you can keep what you got over there i'm
[1:29:33] waiting on you to get where i'm at
[1:29:36] hallelujah that's right but church you
[1:29:38] think about uh the the mind and plan of
[1:29:40] god church elijah gets down there he
[1:29:43] says he says hey you you both you
[1:29:45] supposed to take care of me
[1:29:47] and she like
[1:29:48] huh
[1:29:49] what
[1:29:50] take care of you look look what the
[1:29:51] problem got he said she walked back and
[1:29:53] forth
[1:29:54] but she said i know that he is god
[1:29:58] somebody somebody talk to me
[1:30:00] i know that he is god
[1:30:03] i mean all my confessions come on now
[1:30:07] come on now i made all my confessions
[1:30:09] huh i ain't holding nothing back from
[1:30:11] you guys lord you can look straight
[1:30:13] through me i brought everything to you
[1:30:17] she said i've made my confession i've
[1:30:19] done everything that he required oh my
[1:30:22] heart
[1:30:23] i've made my confessions lord i've done
[1:30:25] everything you required she's basically
[1:30:27] saying lord i gave my life amen my life
[1:30:30] is yours lord hallelujah
[1:30:32] oh my if you expecting something from
[1:30:34] god you got to come to provide a way
[1:30:36] hallelujah she said she says i've done
[1:30:39] everything he required i'm asking for
[1:30:42] our lives for his glory hallelujah and
[1:30:45] then the scripture says god seen her
[1:30:47] amen
[1:30:48] hallelujah and what did he do he touched
[1:30:50] both of those pots
[1:30:52] and he provided
[1:30:54] why did he provide because he made a
[1:30:56] promise to his prophet
[1:31:00] he told his prophet i'm gonna sustain
[1:31:02] you
[1:31:03] so it didn't matter what she had god had
[1:31:05] to keep his word to his prophet
[1:31:07] see what she don't even realize
[1:31:09] she was in the path of faith of that
[1:31:12] prophet
[1:31:16] do you realize hallelujah god put us in
[1:31:18] the path of william branham's harlow put
[1:31:21] us in his path amen we're in that same
[1:31:25] faith path hallelujah amen god allow
[1:31:28] this message to come our way why because
[1:31:30] we could produce what god told him
[1:31:33] that's right
[1:31:35] hallelujah
[1:31:36] see this woman could produce what god
[1:31:38] told elijah that's why she was in his
[1:31:41] path and the only reason why we are
[1:31:43] where we're at is because we can produce
[1:31:45] what god told our prophet
[1:31:48] hallelujah
[1:31:51] we are part of the vision amen and
[1:31:54] before i close amen
[1:31:55] let me show you how powerful this vision
[1:31:57] is let me show you how powerful you are
[1:32:00] holly remember god told tito um
[1:32:03] eliza i mean abraham told eliza he says
[1:32:06] eliza i want you to go find myself a
[1:32:08] wife go find me a wife
[1:32:10] i want you to go find my son or wife
[1:32:12] holly
[1:32:13] he says okay
[1:32:14] he says but don't go get no heathen i
[1:32:16] want you to go back to the kindred and
[1:32:18] get my son a wife
[1:32:19] so really easily he goes down
[1:32:22] church he's probably pondering
[1:32:24] finding a wife man
[1:32:27] this is such a tough task
[1:32:29] but when things are tough that's when
[1:32:31] you have to ask god for leadership
[1:32:34] they may have asked god for leadership
[1:32:36] you have to be patient and you have to
[1:32:38] wait on god hallelujah don't move
[1:32:40] presumptuously take your time honey
[1:32:43] look for the signs of god amen
[1:32:46] and you know one thing my mama used to
[1:32:47] tell me she said son when you talk to
[1:32:50] god be plain
[1:32:52] don't try to be all mysterious with god
[1:32:55] oh lord i know you're an alpha and omega
[1:32:58] you're such a great august being
[1:33:03] amen
[1:33:04] what you really just say lord i need
[1:33:06] your help
[1:33:10] now i got a problem
[1:33:13] and we could oh father you i elohim you
[1:33:16] are the great being of the galaxy you
[1:33:18] are the eternal logos
[1:33:22] that's all right
[1:33:24] but the short version is lord i need
[1:33:25] your help
[1:33:31] we don't have to be all super super
[1:33:34] spiritual and mysterious with god
[1:33:37] because god is healing and revealed in
[1:33:39] what simplicity
[1:33:41] but but but the narrowness down church
[1:33:44] look elijah i mean not elijah um
[1:33:47] eliza
[1:33:49] eliza now goes down to the kendrick and
[1:33:51] he's sitting down there
[1:33:52] and he ties up his camels
[1:33:55] ties up the cameras he's like lord
[1:33:58] i can't find this boy no wife
[1:34:01] he said but i'm gonna pull my heart out
[1:34:03] to you lord
[1:34:04] he says lord
[1:34:06] let the woman
[1:34:08] that comes to the well to give me drink
[1:34:11] not only give me drink
[1:34:13] but give my camel's drink
[1:34:15] let that be the one for my for my for my
[1:34:18] father abraham's son
[1:34:20] and the bible says as soon as he made
[1:34:22] that prayer rebecca came back
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:28] i wish somebody would pray holly
[1:34:31] i wish somebody would step into the path
[1:34:33] of faith hallelujah
[1:34:35] amen church look hell yeah
[1:34:38] he had a vision of what kind of woman he
[1:34:40] was looking for
[1:34:42] but this woman had to be able to fulfill
[1:34:44] his vision but i want to show you how
[1:34:47] powerful this thing was hey man rebecca
[1:34:49] comes out
[1:34:51] and she she's just being what god made
[1:34:54] her to be hallelujah
[1:34:56] and what he made her to be here was
[1:34:59] someone that could fulfill the vision of
[1:35:02] the of your elies amen
[1:35:04] someone that could be a type of crisis
[1:35:07] bride
[1:35:08] hallelujah
[1:35:10] because you know isaac represent jesus
[1:35:12] christ rebecca represent the bride
[1:35:15] hell yeah but look church she was so in
[1:35:17] tune with that vision
[1:35:19] she comes out and and you know they
[1:35:21] probably was having small talk he tied
[1:35:23] up the camels and she says let me give
[1:35:25] you some water
[1:35:27] and then she starts to give him some
[1:35:28] water and then immediately
[1:35:31] she goes and gives the camel
[1:35:34] but what i want you to catch
[1:35:36] it wasn't just one camel
[1:35:47] you can go back and read this in genesis
[1:35:48] chapter 24.
[1:35:51] the bible says
[1:35:53] when eliezer left abraham's house
[1:35:56] he took 10 camels
[1:36:02] he took 10 camels
[1:36:04] and when he got there where rebecca was
[1:36:06] you know how many camels he had 10.
[1:36:11] so rebecca came out to fulfill the
[1:36:13] vision hallelujah
[1:36:15] not only did she give him water
[1:36:17] she gave all 10 camels water
[1:36:21] now i want you to see how strong that
[1:36:23] woman was
[1:36:25] i want you to see how strong the type of
[1:36:27] the bride is
[1:36:28] she wasn't just no ordinary woman
[1:36:30] hallelujah
[1:36:31] church hallelujah you ever go to the
[1:36:33] store and buy a gallon of milk
[1:36:35] hallelujah that's one gallon
[1:36:38] a camel white camel can drink 20 gallons
[1:36:43] and this man had 10.
[1:36:48] that equal out to hurry up 200 gallons
[1:36:52] of water
[1:36:54] like can you see this woman she was
[1:36:56] working hallelujah she was just standing
[1:36:58] back to my armor christians she said no
[1:37:00] this vid i was made to fulfill this
[1:37:02] vision
[1:37:04] [Music]
[1:37:06] i was made for this hour
[1:37:08] for this purpose i came hallelujah chase
[1:37:12] she went to one church let me listen i
[1:37:14] want you to catch us i want you to see
[1:37:16] how powerful this is this is like you
[1:37:18] going into walmart coming out with 10
[1:37:20] gallons of milk
[1:37:22] 20 gallons of milk
[1:37:24] 200 gallons of milk
[1:37:31] that's the equivalent of what she did
[1:37:34] because one camel can drink 20 gallons
[1:37:38] when was the last time you had 20
[1:37:39] gallons in your house
[1:37:42] she did it in one day
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:37:47] oh hallelujah
[1:37:49] now that's what you call bride
[1:37:50] hallelujah
[1:37:52] as soon as he stepped on the scene she
[1:37:54] fulfilled the vision of that man's mind
[1:37:56] hallelujah
[1:37:57] church and that's who we are
[1:37:59] we're here to fulfill the vision of
[1:38:00] malachi 4.
[1:38:03] what you think about it church hey man
[1:38:05] let's work with that a little bit harley
[1:38:07] she comes out he's praying he didn't
[1:38:09] pray say lord give me something to drink
[1:38:11] and give my camel's water hallelujah
[1:38:14] 10 camels
[1:38:17] you gotta ask yourself sisters
[1:38:21] would you have been able to fulfill that
[1:38:22] vision
[1:38:25] let me ask it for you yes if you was
[1:38:26] bribed
[1:38:29] because she was fulfilling the vision of
[1:38:31] eliza
[1:38:33] one camera can drink 20 gallons but this
[1:38:35] man had 10.
[1:38:37] so and the scripture says
[1:38:39] she worked hastily
[1:38:41] she wasn't dragging around because in
[1:38:44] her mind this man got somewhere to go
[1:38:47] so let me hurry up and fill up let me
[1:38:48] hurry up and do everything give him some
[1:38:50] drinking that was just a part of her
[1:38:52] nature honey her nature a part of her
[1:38:54] nature was to fulfill the scriptures
[1:38:57] part of his nature was fulfilled the
[1:38:59] word that all that went out there a part
[1:39:01] of our nature was to step into that
[1:39:03] prophecy concerning her
[1:39:06] hallelujah and that's what she did she
[1:39:08] stepped into hallelujah the line of the
[1:39:10] prophecy that was concerning her amen
[1:39:13] and by that when she started giving the
[1:39:15] animals water and everything hallelujah
[1:39:18] eliezer found rest

[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:21] oh glory to god
[1:42:25] oh my
[1:42:27] this is relating to the identification
[1:42:29] of long-term or overall aims
[1:42:32] and interests and means of achieving
[1:42:35] them hollywood
[1:42:36] see this thing god is strategic why
[1:42:38] because there's a long-term goal
[1:42:42] what is that goal
[1:42:44] the rapture
[1:42:46] and let me tell you right now
[1:42:49] right now with everything going on the
[1:42:51] way the world is so messed up i was just
[1:42:52] telling brother juan you know as an
[1:42:54] evangelist uh things have changed you
[1:42:57] you just you just don't move like you
[1:42:59] used to move because things have changed
[1:43:01] but you know that's a part of god's
[1:43:03] strategic plan
[1:43:06] you know he allows some people to show
[1:43:09] their true colors
[1:43:10] and they don't even realize it was the
[1:43:12] strategic plan of god
[1:43:14] he says okay we're going to shut the
[1:43:16] whole world down and we're going to put
[1:43:18] church on a stream
[1:43:22] we're going to send the whole thing down
[1:43:24] and now you can sit home and watch
[1:43:25] church
[1:43:28] you you gotta come if you want to
[1:43:30] we're gonna stream it
[1:43:33] that was god's plan
[1:43:36] for people to show who they really are
[1:43:39] because some got hooked on that plan
[1:43:41] and they never came back
[1:43:46] hallelujah
[1:43:47] they never came back god allowed that to
[1:43:50] happen why so the church can move on
[1:43:53] amen
[1:43:54] hallelujah
[1:43:56] that's why he allowed 40 years in the
[1:43:57] wilderness to kill off all the dead
[1:43:59] weight
[1:44:02] hallelujah
[1:44:04] and now you have people who who who
[1:44:06] stayed home to to to get the streaming
[1:44:09] and everything and then they never came
[1:44:10] back oh go without you just wash your
[1:44:12] hands weigh your mass brush your teeth
[1:44:14] do whatever
[1:44:20] but church

[1:44:23] in this
[1:44:24] covet has always been here
[1:44:27] ain't that new
[1:44:29] and some of y'all looking at me yes it
[1:44:31] is too
[1:44:32] if it was something new that'll make the
[1:44:33] devil a creator
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:40] if it was something new he'd be a
[1:44:41] creator no it was always here
[1:44:44] what's making it so powerful our
[1:44:45] thoughts
[1:44:48] the way we receive it
[1:44:50] let's just take one attribute of covet
[1:44:53] fever right

[1:52:23] praise the lord
[1:52:25] amen amen i believe the world was
[1:52:28] wonderful tonight amen praise the lord
[1:52:32] you know i enjoy when brother diggs was
[1:52:37] you know
[1:52:39] demonstrating his inspiration
[1:52:43] and it's it was it was very thoughtful i
[1:52:45] mean there was a lot of lesson in there
[1:52:48] noah
[1:52:49] building the eye
[1:52:51] and then the children calling for
[1:52:53] attention going to attend to them
[1:52:56] but sticking with the vision
[1:52:58] praise the lord
[1:53:00] amen
[1:53:01] yes that's very that's very truthful
[1:53:05] praise the lord genesis chapter 24 let's
[1:53:07] just look at something here that our
[1:53:08] brother brought out and uh
[1:53:12] we just want to look at that together
[1:53:14] genesis 24
[1:53:18] verse 10
[1:53:19] the bible says and the seven took ten
[1:53:22] candles
[1:53:24] and the camel
[1:53:26] of his master that was abraham's gambia
[1:53:29] and departed
[1:53:31] for all the girls of his master were in
[1:53:35] his hands
[1:53:36] and he arose and went to messicipiotimia
[1:53:41] onto the city of nahal now you have to
[1:53:44] remember eleazar was the chief seven
[1:53:47] so just like how joseph was in charge of
[1:53:50] everything that potiphar had that's the
[1:53:52] same way eliezer was in charge of
[1:53:55] everything that abraham had because he
[1:53:57] was a chief seven
[1:53:58] now what i want us to also notice in
[1:54:00] that chapter is verse 32.
[1:54:08] and the man eliezer came into the house
[1:54:13] and he ungathered his camels
[1:54:16] and gave straw them and and uh
[1:54:19] pro and
[1:54:21] and providence for the campbells and
[1:54:23] water to wash his feet
[1:54:27] and the men
[1:54:29] feet
[1:54:30] that were with him
[1:54:33] now so this is something that uh
[1:54:37] uh
[1:54:38] that
[1:54:39] you know the the
[1:54:41] you know the the scripture make emphasis
[1:54:44] on eleazar
[1:54:46] the commission was given to eliezer to
[1:54:48] go and get a brine
[1:54:51] but you realize if you study the
[1:54:53] scripture
[1:54:55] the alien went with men
[1:55:00] so there was one man with each of those
[1:55:02] campbells
[1:55:06] praise the lord
[1:55:08] amen
[1:55:09] eli is aha
[1:55:11] the commission
[1:55:12] he was the one that abraham told put
[1:55:15] your hands on my time and swear to me
[1:55:19] that you will not get a warm up from
[1:55:21] anywhere else
[1:55:22] but when eliza was growing he never went
[1:55:25] alone
[1:55:26] because remember he was carrying
[1:55:28] treasures
[1:55:29] he was going to travel in the desert
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:35] so he went with men
[1:55:37] and i'm telling you
[1:55:39] there are men
[1:55:40] that has gone out with this messenger
[1:55:44] to get a bride
[1:55:45] [Laughter]
[1:55:48] the commission was given malachi 4 was
[1:55:50] one man's scripture
[1:55:54] praise the lord
[1:55:55] but there are men that has grabbed the
[1:55:57] vision
[1:56:00] praise the lord now you have to remember
[1:56:02] that brother branham said
[1:56:04] uh he tapped the camera to the power
[1:56:09] amen
[1:56:10] he types the camera because it's a beast
[1:56:13] and the beast is a power
[1:56:15] so he said the same beast that that that
[1:56:19] uh
[1:56:19] rebecca said
[1:56:22] was the same beast that wrote her back
[1:56:26] praise the lord so you see each of those
[1:56:30] men went out
[1:56:31] carrying one of those powers
[1:56:35] praise the lord
[1:56:37] verse 59 also
[1:56:40] the bible says and they sent away
[1:56:43] rebecca
[1:56:44] their sister
[1:56:46] and her nurse
[1:56:48] and abraham seven eliezer
[1:56:52] and who
[1:56:54] and his men
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:00] praise the lord
[1:57:01] so our last day elies are half men
[1:57:04] there are men here
[1:57:07] we are not shaking let people say what i
[1:57:09] want to say about the message but they
[1:57:11] are men
[1:57:12] they are standing for this world
[1:57:15] they are men that are going to ride
[1:57:18] rebecca back to the presence
[1:57:22] of isaac
[1:57:24] god bless you brother
