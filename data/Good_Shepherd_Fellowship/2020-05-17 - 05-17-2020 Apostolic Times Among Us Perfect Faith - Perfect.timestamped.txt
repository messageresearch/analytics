[29:29] will go back to dead FFA what he says
[29:34] trying to get the church to a place and
[29:38] and I believe that's what we've been
[29:41] trying to do you know talking on the
[29:45] seed of the promise you know talking on
[29:50] the promised seed and and all the
[29:54] different things that we've been trying
[29:56] to talk about there my spirit flow
[29:58] freely and I mean just around this time
[30:03] we've been we've been working on on the
[30:07] Holy Ghost you know on yielding to the
[30:09] Holy Ghost so running ourself to the
[30:11] Holy Ghost and so like brother Brennan
[30:15] said here he says trying to get the
[30:19] church to a place to where we could
[30:23] really see apostolic
[30:26] I'm moving among us so taking all of
[30:29] these little subjects and talking about
[30:32] it that's where we provoke in our fatal
[30:35] where we can see apostolic time moving
[30:38] among us so that's what I want to talk
[30:43] about a little bit apostolic time among
[30:46] us and I get a little soft subject here
[30:51] now he says here now continuing to read
[30:55] trying to get get the church into a
[30:57] place to where we who really see
[31:00] apostolic time moving them on us he says
[31:03] that's what we hungry for him in that's
[31:08] what we all hunger that's that's the
[31:11] desire in our hearts because I mean I
[31:14] mean just during the time of Pentecost
[31:18] but scared
[31:19] the church was honored their time of
[31:22] persecution you know what I mean thus a
[31:25] hindrance council wanted to stop this
[31:27] Jesus move or lend me a hug here I don't

[32:10] then you know just to kind of a provoked
[32:14] me to get into action but she felt so
[32:17] sorry for me and so you don't have to
[32:19] throw it down like the air praise Lord
[32:22] so we are all hungry for there he says
[32:25] and it's just lying right at the door so
[32:30] we have a right at our doors our dough
[32:33] of faith we just have to step into it we

[33:47] says if another man have their faith you
[33:50] know you just step out of the way don't

[34:32] for people and they die he says I will
[34:34] keep raining you know and it's I mean
[34:37] it's just to the place where we have to
[34:40] exercise our faith you know you have to

[41:19] he says this will help us flow out to

[41:27] door if we step into it he said we want
[41:30] to see more of it we want to see Sasha
[41:32] flow and it will help us to flow out to
[41:35] others he said remember Jesus he never
[41:39] used his power for himself he used it
[41:42] for others there's what it was sinful so
[41:47] that's what we I mean we're trying to
[41:50] encourage ourselves this morning you
[41:53] know as we look into this that we want
[41:55] to talk about never Branham also says
[41:57] something in that message I can I will
[42:00] tell you the testimony but listen to
[42:02] this he said he says that's that's
[42:07] perfect faith he says I get spares too
[42:09] you know I get moody I get to a spot to
[42:15] word what get me is where I get to those
[42:21] spells when I get
[42:24] all over work and Satan comes telling me
[42:28] why nobody care for you you really you
[42:34] really haven't got a friend in the world
[42:37] see and so remember I'm not immune to
[42:44] the temptation see I've got to overcome
[42:48] that now let's let's look at what is
[42:51] happening here where Bellamy is talking
[42:53] about
[42:54] you know the time like every one of us
[42:56] we feel that you know and you say to
[42:59] yourself I want people appreciating what
[43:00] I'm doing you know and you say to
[43:02] yourself oh my goodness
[43:04] I mean nobody gave me in a phone call
[43:07] you know I mean you know they never talk
[43:11] about me you know and we go through all
[43:13] of this and you know that they will keep
[43:16] buzzing at our mind and we just mean I
[43:20] mean just like brother branham said he
[43:22] says it's a spell you know Satan keeps
[43:25] spitting in our face with those things
[43:27] you know nobody love you you weapon out
[43:30] he's nobody care for you and you happy
[43:32] Allegheny says you know I mean you are
[43:35] just the worst one everybody see your
[43:37] prayer life see your reading he just
[43:39] keeps spitting you just keep spitting I
[43:42] think we can spit back him in praise the
[43:45] Lord he says remember I'm not I'm not
[43:48] immune to temptation I've got to
[43:50] overcome there he says listen to this
[43:53] now this is where it is he says then
[43:56] when I look back and see something like
[44:00] this
[44:01] and what actually he was talking about a
[44:04] few paragraphs about this he was talking
[44:07] about a healing of a young boy he says
[44:10] doing the seals this ball was sick and
[44:12] the parents took the board I mean the
[44:15] doctors have pronounced him sick with
[44:18] with with with an illness that I didn't
[44:21] put their coat there I have it right
[44:24] here so praise the Lord
[44:26] you know and amber Branham talking about
[44:30] this little boy oh my
[44:36] let me let me get right back there and
[44:38] read the code to you he says I if
[44:42] anybody want to know this little calling
[44:45] year and during the time of the seals
[44:47] the doctor had told that the little boy
[44:51] with rheumatic fever that he had to lay
[44:55] on his back and drink through a tube he
[44:59] says that was it that was what the
[45:02] doctor said and his father and his
[45:04] mother brought him from from the home
[45:07] and and set him in a room pray for him
[45:11] now broadband I'm referring to this
[45:13] these parents brought their son home
[45:16] after the doctor had pronounced him that
[45:19] he's going to live the rest of his life
[45:21] lying on the bed being fair but tube and
[45:24] those parents will not take what the
[45:27] doctor said
[45:28] the broader son home put him in bed and
[45:30] and verbatim says and the Lord Jesus
[45:34] heal him so completely he went back to
[45:38] school and the authorities had the
[45:42] authority called him about it just like
[45:44] the man a beautiful remember now we are
[45:47] talking about apostolic days I mean the
[45:51] the the the authorities call him in
[45:54] about his soul they call especially the
[45:57] man that have pronounced him that he
[45:59] would have to drink from tube the rest
[46:00] of his life they called especially who
[46:04] was waiting on him and so he said he
[46:07] couldn't believe such a thing as dead
[46:09] and they brought the boy down for a test
[46:13] and he was completely normal and well
[46:19] verbatim quotes a scripture he says then
[46:22] Jesus came and attempt of power was
[46:25] broken now so that's what brother
[46:28] Branham was saying when I look back to
[46:30] something like that when the devil threw
[46:32] all his spells on me all you have to do
[46:35] is look back and see what God has done
[46:39] look back to a testimony of God healing
[46:43] somebody or something that God has done
[46:45] in your in your life and then see what
[46:48] the prophet of God says
[46:49] yeah he says when he says and when I
[46:52] look back and see something like that I
[46:55] put it right back in the devil face amen
[46:59] don't spit in his face cough you know
[47:02] you can't take the mucus and stick it in
[47:05] his eyes but about him said I put it
[47:07] right back in his face and and and said
[47:10] what's about that Satan you making me
[47:13] Moody you making me feel that I'm
[47:16] rejected
[47:16] put her right back in his face and say
[47:18] what's about that time when God did this
[47:20] for me
[47:21] what's about that time when God brought
[47:22] me back you know I mean he says I put it
[47:26] right back in his face and say what's
[47:27] about that time he said that helps me to
[47:31] overcome you will never overcome until
[47:34] you can put things right back in the
[47:36] devil face if you just stayed there and
[47:39] cry and cry and cry well I mean he would
[47:42] keep bullying you he would keep spitting
[47:44] in your face I don't even know if he
[47:46] brush his teeth on that but I don't
[47:47] matter about that because you don't have
[47:50] to spit in your face praise the Lord
[47:51] verbatim says and there helps me to
[47:54] overcome what about that amen that was
[47:59] what the Apostle says this is that
[48:02] that's what Peter said and what was he
[48:06] doing he was putting the right back in
[48:08] the face of the devil you don't have to
[48:10] call us drunk this is that are you
[48:14] reading your Bible this is that which
[48:16] was spoken by the Prophet I mean that is
[48:19] the only way that's the reason why God
[48:22] do things in our life so we can point
[48:24] back to what he had done if nothing is
[48:28] happening now you went back to what God
[48:30] has done that this is that praise the
[48:34] Lord verbatim says what's above that
[48:36] amen
[48:38] so that's what we are talking about this
[48:41] morning he says this is dead and I love
[48:45] the way he says it year praise the Lord
[48:47] the resurrection of Lazarus 1951 he says
[48:51] a day that we are living in it's a great
[48:56] Marsh in time do you believe that
[49:00] you know pinch of steps red and wash the
[49:03] neighbors
[49:04] he says mash in time everybody want to
[49:07] impersonate somebody else
[49:09] he says I've always said I didn't care
[49:15] water my my shoes wash my trousers or my
[49:22] shirt match my code he says I want man
[49:25] experience to match God's Bible and when
[49:31] he said you must be born again when they
[49:34] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:37] on the day of Pentecost I want that I
[49:39] want my experience to match that Peter
[49:43] said this is that if this isn't that I'm
[49:48] going to keep this till death comes amen
[49:53] there's our inspiration this morning I'm
[49:55] going to do this
[49:56] amen I'm having a good time with this
[50:00] and like you can have a good time with
[50:02] this on tear that comes amen so that's
[50:05] what we want to talk about brother
[50:06] Branham says apostolic time is right
[50:09] right at the door and all you have to do
[50:13] you just have to step into a bad faith
[50:16] you have to step into a bad faith you
[50:19] have to take a situation and stand on
[50:21] God's Word no matter what the symptom is
[50:24] no matter how ugly is getting take a
[50:27] situation stand on God's Word and
[50:29] believe God expect God every day to be
[50:33] able to change their thing amen
[50:35] that apostolic time praise the Lord I
[50:37] mean Peter was impressing those people
[50:42] will not take you know a no for an
[50:44] answer the God into a prayer meeting
[50:46] they started praying and because it was
[50:48] already pronounced that Peter was going
[50:50] to be killed I mean they were praying
[50:52] and and and God you know released Peter
[50:56] from praising he went to the prayer
[50:58] meeting praise the Lord those are all
[50:59] apostolic time is right among us but
[51:02] urbana say is to the door we can step in
[51:04] it so that's what we've been trying to
[51:06] encourage ourself because like brother
[51:10] Branham said you know we talk about the
[51:14] I mean the five manifestation of the
[51:16] telephone he says those things that we
[51:19] saw temporarily in his ministry they are
[51:23] going to be things that are going to
[51:24] happen you know just like I said with
[51:27] with Ruth you know a little ballad a
[51:30] wheat heared a little ballet that's what
[51:32] our boss encouraged his workmen to do to
[51:35] just throw a little bonus here for Ruth
[51:38] as she Labor's in the field as she's
[51:40] gleaning a special associate time the
[51:42] church is gleaning you know holding on
[51:45] the promise of God I mean we can come
[51:47] together in big numbers but we are
[51:49] taking God's Word every day applying the
[51:52] talking to our home and we are expecting
[51:54] God to show a little bonus yet and a
[51:57] little bonus there praise the Lord
[51:58] that's why we are encouraging ourselves
[52:01] trying to stir up that apostolic time
[52:04] among us that's our promise
[52:07] we're Branham says we will write the
[52:10] amen to the book of ants because at the
[52:14] end of that book there was no amen to
[52:16] that book because this church has to be
[52:19] the continuation of the book of ads we
[52:23] have to be the continuation of the book
[52:25] of ads we have to the very same thing we
[52:28] saw happening and mourn the believers
[52:30] it's not that we go in to manufacture a
[52:34] God want to do the same he's putting us
[52:36] in the situation in different situation
[52:39] where we can see him reeling them on his
[52:42] people praise the Lord just yesterday
[52:47] there I mean we're steaming and sister
[52:53] quiche they were trying to do something
[52:54] a little bit for her birthday and and I
[53:02] mean we're just doing something to the
[53:03] house and and moreover it was I mean to
[53:07] be able to celebrate her life after the
[53:10] soldering you know and we were set in
[53:14] the airing and you know after everything
[53:18] in we decided to pray and I was praying
[53:21] and and the scripture just struck my
[53:24] mind here is Elijah
[53:28] after the farming he went over to the
[53:30] king you know he was talking to the king
[53:33] of Israel and he was just testifying to
[53:35] the king the different things that God
[53:37] has done he was also talking to the king
[53:40] about the Shimon a woman you know he was
[53:43] testifying God did this you know God get
[53:45] this and God did this and he was telling
[53:48] the shimon a woman even their woman down
[53:50] and you remember that Gentile woman i
[53:52] live somewhere down there says oh yeah
[53:54] yeah I remember hurting and her son even
[53:57] died during that time and God brought
[53:59] him back to life and I mean the king is
[54:01] just sitting down there and he's
[54:03] thinking wow this guy he's talking
[54:04] strange to bring him death back to life
[54:06] these things stay happening in Israel
[54:09] and right at that time the woman and her
[54:12] son was right there trying to plead
[54:15] their case to get their land back her
[54:18] little boy was holding her garment and I
[54:21] mean she was trying to get in trying to
[54:23] find somebody to talk and Elijah talking
[54:25] about this thing he just turned his eyes
[54:27] his eyes fell on the letter he said okay
[54:30] even the woman here yo not know another
[54:32] woman let the little boy here you know
[54:34] so we're BAM says it was not far away
[54:37] you know and even as he talks about the
[54:40] story of this little boy he caught her
[54:42] what Peter said he said even a man of
[54:46] beautiful he said he's right among you
[54:49] now our witness is not far away we're
[54:52] not talking about you know what happened
[54:54] at I the rest he is good for us to talk
[54:56] about it in the days of Elijah is good
[54:59] but our witness is right before us our
[55:03] Whitney is right before us praise the
[55:06] Lord
[55:07] who goes to cold and leave their witness
[55:09] back the witnesses have to be the they
[55:13] have to be there to testify you can say
[55:16] to the judge
[55:16] yes my witness he saw it he was there he
[55:19] heard what happened our witnesses
[55:21] arrived before us today where Bellamy
[55:23] says is right at the door
[55:27] it's right at the door
[55:29] all you need to do is to just step into
[55:31] a bad faith just step into it and start
[55:36] shouting my faith and letting think that
[55:38] you have lost your mind
[55:39] remain even if you lose your MA
[55:42] God and stay able to give you a better
[55:43] thinking than the one that we have right
[55:46] now and praise the Lord
[55:48] I mean apostolic time is right before us
[55:50] that's the thing that we're trying to
[55:52] encourage ourselves into this Holy Ghost
[55:54] is real God is still in the healing
[55:59] business praise the Lord and we were
[56:03] praying there's a young man we've been
[56:06] praying for his work made formal work
[56:10] made two sister Kosan and I mean he was
[56:13] taken to the hospital
[56:15] honor the the cover virus and now and I
[56:20] mean I just was this early this week or
[56:23] maybe last week they asked the wife and
[56:26] you know and the son to come and see him
[56:30] for the last time you know she said when
[56:32] it call her it was going to be to to
[56:35] terror for her to go and see your
[56:37] husband and be him fair way and I mean
[56:39] when Bearden and she came from the area
[56:43] now I mean she I mean she believed that
[56:45] it's not a virus she's believing is
[56:48] something else that is happening to her

[57:55] mean that he's going to pass this life
[57:57] what more can we do you know then just
[58:01] to thank God and believe that God can
[58:03] turn the situation around praise the
[58:05] Lord you know so we believe in God for
[58:07] that just like we did when that young
[58:10] lady had that brain damage from that
[58:12] accident over there in in Rochester that
[58:15] young lady is living today
[58:18] you know she's living today in full
[58:21] consciousness you know I just I just
[58:24] spoke to her a couple of weeks ago so I
[58:26] mean it's right at the door apostolic
[58:29] time is right at the door you just had
[58:31] to step into a buffet and claim your
[58:34] blessing get your own a testimony then I
[58:37] allow the devil to keep spitting in your
[58:38] face amen praise the Lord you can spit
[58:42] back in his face and tell him what's
[58:44] about that amen you have to bring out
[58:48] something that is real to you
[58:50] praise the Lord that's the time that we
[58:54] are living in
[58:56] Amen bourbon sales year in the message
[59:00] expectation 1950 he says it's time that
[59:04] the church needed some good old
[59:07] fashioned apostolic teachings of the
[59:09] Bible to get the thing line up to get
[59:13] our faith line up you know to get our
[59:17] faith line up you know because just like
[59:21] I was talking about those young people
[59:22] you know I was I was talking to one of
[59:27] the sisters did too you know any any
[59:30] whole children they are all you know
[59:31] believing God for this situation so I
[59:34] was telling her asses as his you know
[59:38] there was nothing wrong and says I
[59:40] rather be on the side of those kids
[59:42] believing that God is able to resume
[59:45] then for me to be on the side now
[59:47] believing even if God don't raise him or
[59:49] we are not on the losing side
[59:51] I mean what he comes back on that we are
[59:54] still on the winning side because we
[59:56] know that he is in a better place
[59:58] praise the Lord so I was trying to help
[1:00:02] the young people also I was talking to
[1:00:04] their masses as it slope we have to
[1:00:06] place this thing right for you to live
[1:00:09] in deny it's not faith it's my faith you
[1:00:14] have to accept the fact and believe that
[1:00:17] God can change it living in denial is
[1:00:22] fear when people are living in denial no
[1:00:26] it's not happening you are just afraid
[1:00:28] because you know is happening I thought
[1:00:31] I said I said look look at Lazarus Jesus
[1:00:36] even wept he cried so it's not wrong to
[1:00:40] cry if you have to weep weep and stay
[1:00:45] believe that God can change the
[1:00:46] situation that's what faith is faith is
[1:00:50] accepting the reality and believing that
[1:00:53] God can change it Jesus saw his disciple
[1:00:59] he says Lazarus sleepeth
[1:01:01] it so all yeah he does well if he's
[1:01:03] relaxing we heard that he was sick if
[1:01:06] now he is sleeping then which means he's
[1:01:09] feeling much better
[1:01:10] Jesus says no I have to make this thing
[1:01:11] real to these people so the way nothing
[1:01:15] is a praying he was sleeping we were
[1:01:16] coming to make a resurrection story
[1:01:18] Lazarus is dead Lazarus is dead because
[1:01:25] if he's not dead is not resurrection for
[1:01:28] the man to rise from the dead he has to
[1:01:31] be dead praise the Lord
[1:01:36] so you see most of the time that's what
[1:01:39] happy you know we are believing one
[1:01:42] thing and we are confessing the wrong
[1:01:44] thing that's nothing
[1:01:49] brother Brahim said it over and over he
[1:01:53] says the people are always misplacing
[1:01:55] faith does not fit that is fear if we
[1:02:02] are in a situation we have to confess it
[1:02:05] that's what is happening lord I give it
[1:02:09] to you this is where I am I
[1:02:12] in your hands because I know you can
[1:02:14] change the situation you are more than
[1:02:17] able to change the situation you see the
[1:02:23] the the Pentecostal church out there
[1:02:25] they carry master's church they believe
[1:02:27] the teaching the people not to accept
[1:02:30] their situation no don't believe it
[1:02:33] you know I mean confessing confessing
[1:02:36] positive confessing that God can do it
[1:02:39] does not means that it's not happening
[1:02:42] so they are keeping the church in living
[1:02:49] in denying and that's the reason why the
[1:02:52] people cannot get victory to step out of
[1:02:55] their own belief we have to accept
[1:03:02] whatever is happening to us though we
[1:03:05] need more of you we need more of you
[1:03:09] because we believe you can bring us out
[1:03:11] of this situation we need a revival law
[1:03:14] because we are drying out we are losing
[1:03:17] praise we are losing our life of prayer
[1:03:20] we need a revival that is truth
[1:03:23] confession
[1:03:24] look at Isaiah the prophet he said woe
[1:03:26] is me Lord I'm a man on dawn speaking
[1:03:31] you know what with the people and I mean
[1:03:33] he just confessed his sin before God he
[1:03:36] never come before God to sell all your
[1:03:39] people I lost he plays himself right in
[1:03:42] the place of the people that's what
[1:03:45] faith is faith is
[1:03:52] she's a man you know confessing and
[1:03:57] saying their Lord this is the situation
[1:03:59] we are in but we believe that you open
[1:04:02] the Red Sea Prince alone when Moses got
[1:04:04] down there to the Red Sea he never stand
[1:04:06] and says mind I just hit dry lane
[1:04:09] no no no that's why he was weeping
[1:04:11] because Monti was on both side the sea
[1:04:14] was before him he knew there was nowhere
[1:04:16] to go he have just said to the people
[1:04:19] the the the Egyptian you see today you
[1:04:22] will see them normal forever but where
[1:04:24] would they go he started weeping
[1:04:32] faith is not make-believe when we try to
[1:04:37] make up things we try to create walking
[1:04:44] in imagination faith is reality we are
[1:04:49] dealing with real issues before us
[1:04:58] praise the Lord it's almost like I mean
[1:05:03] sometimes even we parents we deal with
[1:05:07] those things when they are real issues
[1:05:09] going on with our children would you
[1:05:10] like to draw our overall the address
[1:05:12] gates you know because they are innocent
[1:05:14] they are real issues you have to start
[1:05:18] looking at the real issues and you have
[1:05:21] to start dealing with it as you believe
[1:05:22] for God to help that child and that's
[1:05:27] the way that God deals with us
[1:05:31] we have to come to him
[1:05:33] just as we ever Branham says that he
[1:05:36] says at the time the church neither grew
[1:05:38] olfaction apostolic teachings there we
[1:05:41] get the things line up we have to line
[1:05:45] up everything we have to bring
[1:05:48] everything in the right context of God's
[1:05:51] Word for faith to get in action I'm
[1:05:56] telling you faith is not blind if it was
[1:05:58] blind when I open the blind eyes
[1:06:02] praise the Lord
[1:06:04] faith has chest on his I mean hair on
[1:06:08] his chest
[1:06:09] fred has muscles faith is real fear is
[1:06:13] not blind I'm telling you praise the
[1:06:16] Lord Amen faith he makes a lean man to
[1:06:22] walk so if it knows how to walk
[1:06:24] amen faith knows how to walk fit knows
[1:06:27] how to talk that's the reason why we
[1:06:30] have to line up with the word most of
[1:06:35] the time we are afraid now I was talking
[1:06:41] to another young man and he was telling
[1:06:42] me something you know and and and and he
[1:06:47] sounds like he was confessing fake
[1:06:49] I told me I said know your language to
[1:06:52] me is fear if you believe that God can
[1:06:56] do it then you would go and do what the
[1:06:58] doctor says praise the Lord
[1:07:01] amen just this morning I was just I was
[1:07:04] just getting myself ready and all sorts
[1:07:06] of things was running to my mind and I
[1:07:08] was thinking about the young people
[1:07:09] because I'm thinking about doing
[1:07:11] something for them you know in such a
[1:07:14] period of time and the scripture that
[1:07:16] came to my mind young people if you are
[1:07:17] listening was speaking the truth in love
[1:07:23] that's what good friendship is me you
[1:07:29] know we have to speak the truth in love
[1:07:32] so well young people you can be
[1:07:34] expecting that I won't go into death
[1:07:36] he says the gifts in calling I in the
[1:07:39] church but the people don't know how to
[1:07:41] control themselves they don't know how
[1:07:47] to take hold of God
[1:07:49] I mean
[1:07:54] you know I I don't I don't try to I
[1:07:57] don't try to push the church into into
[1:08:01] gifts because we have to based on the
[1:08:03] word but I mean there there are people
[1:08:05] that have been dreaming I mean some of
[1:08:07] the sisters been calling me and telling
[1:08:09] me dreams you know when you know
[1:08:11] dreaming of us coming back together
[1:08:13] dreaming of the things that is happening
[1:08:15] in church dreaming of other people and
[1:08:17] every time they say that to me and we
[1:08:19] just talk about it I just pray with them
[1:08:21] I says well let's pray about it less
[1:08:23] committed in the hands of God because
[1:08:25] you don't want to put a gift ahead of
[1:08:27] the word if the people are not rightly
[1:08:29] taught by the word they can control the
[1:08:32] church with gifts and gifts never
[1:08:36] control the church is the word that
[1:08:38] control the church but the gifts are
[1:08:46] there but if we don't line up our faith
[1:08:50] you know if we don't do things come back
[1:08:54] to the word and live the way the world
[1:08:56] want us to live and concentrate our
[1:08:58] lives we will have problem charging
[1:09:06] those gifts because if a person is here
[1:09:09] living a contrary life to the word and
[1:09:12] you come and bring us a gift by vision
[1:09:14] or a gift by dreams you trouble our mind
[1:09:20] it will be difficult for you to receive
[1:09:23] from me if you have questions on my life
[1:09:30] that's the reason why every gift is
[1:09:32] charged by the word no matter how you
[1:09:36] know real it seems we have to bring it
[1:09:39] back to the word because we don't want
[1:09:41] to be controlled by give we want to be
[1:09:44] led by the word because when the people
[1:09:47] are controlled by gift and those gifts
[1:09:50] are not happening then we start
[1:09:51] manufacturing things and people start
[1:09:54] saying oh I saw the bird fly through my
[1:09:56] window or I saw you know I would just
[1:09:58] come in my head and and and somebody
[1:10:00] appear in the back in my mirror and then
[1:10:03] all of these things and then it just
[1:10:05] start making up things and making up
[1:10:07] thing before you know
[1:10:08] the church had just gone into wishcraft
[1:10:10] say I've seen those things I have seen
[1:10:12] those things and know what I'm talking
[1:10:14] about
[1:10:24] the church need a good old-fashioned
[1:10:27] apostolic teaching of God to get the
[1:10:30] things line up the Gibson calling I in
[1:10:33] the church but the people don't know how
[1:10:36] to control themselves they don't know
[1:10:41] how to control themselves because you
[1:10:43] have to know Satan is going to attack
[1:10:46] those gates he's going to throw things
[1:10:48] at you they don't know how to take ahold
[1:10:57] of God praise the Lord
[1:11:01] we're talking about apostolic times that
[1:11:03] is a Mona's it's right at the door
[1:11:06] praise the Lord
[1:11:08] apostolic time is for the brothers is
[1:11:11] for the sisters is for the mothers I
[1:11:13] mean it's for the young people right in
[1:11:18] the book of Acts Philip have four
[1:11:20] daughters they had a gift to prophesy
[1:11:25] four young daughters that were baptized
[1:11:28] with the holy God they had a genuine
[1:11:30] gift they could prophesize praise the
[1:11:35] Lord and you know what the Bible says
[1:11:37] even about them they were young they
[1:11:39] were young people in my mind I'm
[1:11:41] thinking those young people they were so
[1:11:44] those those young ladies they were so
[1:11:47] true just to know that God visited young
[1:11:51] married at the age of you know a young
[1:11:54] woman a virgin so every one of them were
[1:11:56] just keeping himself that God who
[1:11:58] visited them God would give them the
[1:11:59] baptism of the holy gold God will do
[1:12:01] something in your life for young girls
[1:12:11] poor wind right there in the house they
[1:12:14] broke up into prophecy they said a man
[1:12:16] that has this thing trial with for him
[1:12:18] there in Rome and brother branham even
[1:12:25] spoke about there he says Paul when it
[1:12:27] gains the word of God because that
[1:12:28] prophecy was doubt said the Lord but he
[1:12:33] because to understand that Paul was so
[1:12:36] burden to give his life so he knew that
[1:12:41] their prophecy was speaking about him he
[1:12:44] knew so there were young people in the
[1:12:53] book of us praise the Lord I mean we can
[1:12:56] just pick up all sorts of different
[1:12:57] things happen in the book of us as
[1:12:59] chapter 1 the Bible says the promise of
[1:13:02] the father to make them witnesses that's
[1:13:04] how the book of I studied you know they
[1:13:07] were waiting on the promise of the
[1:13:08] father and the promise of the father is
[1:13:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost where God
[1:13:13] comes down and poured his spirit in the
[1:13:15] life of his children
[1:13:19] praise the Lord as chapter 2 they were
[1:13:23] in one Accord waiting on that promise
[1:13:27] and the scripture tells us the 120 that
[1:13:33] were in the upper room brother Branham
[1:13:35] says even Mary she had to be there God
[1:13:40] was not going to take an excuse for
[1:13:42] nothing to see all you know I bet a Lord
[1:13:46] Jesus for for nine months all I raised
[1:13:50] him up know she needed to be in an upper
[1:13:52] room to get a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:55] so God is not going to take our
[1:13:58] experience above the Holy Ghost we have
[1:14:01] had different experiences he had there
[1:14:03] with us in different ways but he want us
[1:14:06] to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost for
[1:14:09] the hour that we are living him for
[1:14:11] every day is an everyday experience he
[1:14:14] want you to have the Holy Ghost for
[1:14:16] everyday life just like how David said
[1:14:20] in the son his mercy is renew every
[1:14:23] morning go want to give
[1:14:25] you about is in every morning so you can
[1:14:28] be able to face the challenge for every
[1:14:30] day amen
[1:14:33] we're not going to sneak on one
[1:14:35] experience fellowship with God through
[1:14:38] reconciliation brother Branham says
[1:14:40] that's what the church needs today and
[1:14:43] olfaction apostolic God shaking Holy
[1:14:47] Ghost revival and how is it coming
[1:14:50] through the word how is it coming it's
[1:14:53] coming right through your home when you
[1:14:55] can just stay on your knees and cry
[1:14:57] before God I want a true feeling in my
[1:14:59] heart I'm going look one Lord I'm
[1:15:03] getting caught on you I need a true
[1:15:06] feeling in my heart I need an awakening
[1:15:10] an apostolic God shaking Holy Ghost
[1:15:15] revival he says that's right I don't
[1:15:17] mean a bunch of fanatism it's easier for
[1:15:21] us to get into fanaticism when it's a
[1:15:23] group because this other person shouts
[1:15:26] oh we shall the other person live for
[1:15:27] their hands so we live for the ends but
[1:15:29] right now in your bedroom you can have a
[1:15:32] real experience of God because you can
[1:15:38] cry out your hand when you if you don't
[1:15:39] like people to see you crying go in your
[1:15:41] room and cry now because people come to
[1:15:45] church they don't want to cry because
[1:15:46] they don't like people see them crying
[1:15:47] now you can stay in your room like the
[1:15:49] dough and cry but that's why we need he
[1:15:53] says I don't believe in a bunch of
[1:15:55] emotional work up but I mean a real true
[1:16:00] blood borne salvation they said man free
[1:16:04] from sin and make him a new creature in
[1:16:08] Christ praise the Lord that's what we
[1:16:13] need because we haven't we having an
[1:16:16] open door that is right before us and
[1:16:18] that open door is an apostolic
[1:16:21] experience we have an open door that we
[1:16:24] can step right into I'm telling you try
[1:16:28] your life will never be the same I mean
[1:16:32] your life will never be the same
[1:16:36] the Lord I mean that's what we are
[1:16:38] talking about is this Holy Ghost
[1:16:41] experience this apostolic time that is
[1:16:45] right before us this is death I mean you
[1:16:50] can put it to the devil face you have to
[1:16:52] look for things what you can put to the
[1:16:54] devil Fadem allow him to keep blasting
[1:16:56] your mind with this and blasting your
[1:16:59] mind with Darin and I just just just
[1:17:01] making you feeling sick as if there is
[1:17:04] not a god you have a God in heaven David
[1:17:08] will not allow that young as young as he
[1:17:12] was he stepped out there and he saw
[1:17:15] Goliath he did not care for Goliath
[1:17:18] sighs he didn't care for his size the
[1:17:24] thing that troubled David was to hear a
[1:17:26] Philistine using curse word on Jehovah
[1:17:31] it was not funny to laugh at like you
[1:17:34] year all of this conversation people use
[1:17:36] curse word on God and sometimes we laugh
[1:17:38] about it if to David it was not funny it
[1:17:44] was not funny to just walk right in
[1:17:46] there and seeing a man define almighty
[1:17:50] god and everybody kept quiet program
[1:17:57] talks about a story and there happened
[1:18:00] during the time of Roe Davis I think rod
[1:18:02] Davis told him their story he says there
[1:18:05] was a man you know a critic that came
[1:18:07] out in order and he started criticizing
[1:18:10] he brought an ascetic thing and says you
[1:18:14] know something like an icy water or so
[1:18:16] he said let me see you people yeah he
[1:18:18] says you say the Bible said you drink
[1:18:21] daily things and you were not done he
[1:18:23] says let me see
[1:18:24] is that a believer yet I can drink this
[1:18:26] bourbon says a man he says you should
[1:18:29] know where you are standing I don't
[1:18:30] advise you to do that he says if God
[1:18:32] don't call you to do that he says but
[1:18:34] there was a man in a crowd they will not
[1:18:36] take that challenge he told his wife he
[1:18:39] said honey if I die I will meet you in
[1:18:41] glory but I will not stand you and allow
[1:18:43] that man to cost God praise the Lord
[1:18:46] he said he stepped out there by faith he
[1:18:48] drowned us
[1:18:50] water and the man was standing there
[1:18:51] right there and God move on the scene
[1:18:53] and I men never die he says that all
[1:18:58] critter has to give his life to God he
[1:19:04] says that not a man was there

[1:20:33] to this message that God has given to us
[1:20:35] praise the Lord
[1:20:37] taste and see that God is good father
[1:20:40] the hour has come 1956 let's read this
[1:20:44] one we're balancing and that's what the
[1:20:45] church needs tonight a garrison of
[1:20:48] olfaction apostolic teaching he says so
[1:20:52] this lukewarm farmer in and out up and
[1:20:55] down doesn't get into our church amen
[1:20:59] praise the Lord in and out up and down
[1:21:03] we gave all the reason why you know we
[1:21:08] can come to church i we are just talking
[1:21:10] to the people last night and we were
[1:21:11] talking different things about all when
[1:21:13] we get back to church how is going to be
[1:21:15] I said well I don't know we will just
[1:21:17] see how it's going to be what are we
[1:21:19] going to just set people on setting date
[1:21:21] are we going to rotate the Sunday you
[1:21:24] know but you see no matter how we do it
[1:21:27] there will still be people that would
[1:21:28] not want to come to church they would
[1:21:30] stay give reason why they don't want to
[1:21:31] come they would say give reasons oh but
[1:21:37] I'm telling you I'm going to be a deacon
[1:21:38] at that time if you are scheduled to
[1:21:40] come a certain time and you come out
[1:21:42] with some kind of for cheap reason we'll
[1:21:44] take you out of the list you still home
[1:21:46] follow Church online maybe that is good
[1:21:48] for you he says all this lukewarm you
[1:21:57] know just like we were talking on on
[1:22:00] iniquity of the animal rights that's
[1:22:02] exactly what it is
[1:22:04] look how Jesus please there in the
[1:22:07] endtime prophecy because iniquity shall
[1:22:10] abound the love of many will was called
[1:22:14] so what iniquity does to the believer is
[1:22:17] that it dispossessed us it takes the
[1:22:23] strain it takes I mean the energy it
[1:22:26] takes the encouragement when we started
[1:22:28] when we start looking in the face of
[1:22:30] God's Word and start Allari things that
[1:22:33] we know we should not do it dispossesses
[1:22:37] you because you know what the devil is
[1:22:40] going to take that thing and keep
[1:22:42] blasting your mind you say you are a
[1:22:44] child of God see what you are doing how
[1:22:46] can you talk about Apostolic Faith how
[1:22:48] can you talk about the book of Acts how
[1:22:51] can you believe God for a resurrection
[1:22:53] or a rupture or a body change well like
[1:22:59] I said don't allow him to keep spitting
[1:23:01] in your face you take him back to what
[1:23:03] God has done he says that's what we need
[1:23:11] he says I did say that's right that's
[1:23:14] right I I have two meter too many things
[1:23:17] to creep in Brethren's too many things
[1:23:20] he says that we left the old landmark
[1:23:24] from the beginning we have left too many
[1:23:32] things to creep in and now we have got
[1:23:36] everything in he says and all the Asians
[1:23:39] and everything you know and everything
[1:23:42] is in the church because we never
[1:23:45] garrison by the word and that's what
[1:23:53] we're trying to do to get back to the
[1:23:55] world amen
[1:23:57] we're trying to get back to the word
[1:24:01] there was how Peter defend himself he
[1:24:06] had to defend the church he says this is
[1:24:09] that if you want to know what is
[1:24:11] happening in the month of this that is
[1:24:13] happy we have a prophecy that we can
[1:24:15] take it back to and that's how we have
[1:24:20] to do as end time believers we have to
[1:24:22] find ourself in the Bible we can say
[1:24:28] this day this scripture is fulfilled the
[1:24:33] Bible speaks of the hour that we are
[1:24:35] living in Bible speaks prophesied about
[1:24:37] you know us moving right into this time
[1:24:40] we can say this day looking at that
[1:24:43] stripped you're looking at what God is
[1:24:44] doing in our life in our maze the
[1:24:51] message influency said we have we have
[1:24:54] come times that people think that this
[1:24:57] holiness before God is just some kind of
[1:25:02] a mockery people just think is some kind
[1:25:07] of a mockery but that is the thing that
[1:25:12] released the life of God I released the
[1:25:14] power of God when the people consecrate
[1:25:17] himself when the people keep themselves
[1:25:20] away from unbelief to keep themselves
[1:25:22] away from lie
[1:25:24] they don't fill their mind with the
[1:25:26] things on the media normal chapter 6 it
[1:25:31] talks about that the the nasara coveting
[1:25:34] now honor the Old Testament they are
[1:25:37] coveting a man or a woman who choose to
[1:25:41] give themself for a certain period of
[1:25:43] time you can go for six months or you
[1:25:46] can go for a year and just consecrate
[1:25:48] yourself and then honor than the nasara
[1:25:51] covenant you look so old because you
[1:25:53] grow your head I mean and I mean you
[1:25:56] just you just looking everybody knows
[1:25:59] that that person is concentrated they
[1:26:03] are living I mean they are concentrating
[1:26:05] himself use you you take yourself away
[1:26:08] from whining and Adam you you just
[1:26:10] extend yourself where everybody no they
[1:26:12] kept themselves before God but under the
[1:26:16] law they can go in and come out but
[1:26:20] honor this new covenant is God that call
[1:26:23] his people into that nasara company it
[1:26:26] comes by the new birth when we are born
[1:26:30] again we are separated from this world
[1:26:32] wash by the water of the word so it
[1:26:37] brings us to the place that's the reason
[1:26:39] why we can live a holy life one week and
[1:26:41] gets back to the things of the word no
[1:26:43] then you are not caught under this new
[1:26:46] covenant he says people
[1:26:56] thing there this holiness before God is
[1:26:59] just some kind of a mockery or some kind
[1:27:02] of a bunch of people would blossom know
[1:27:04] some kind of a cut or and that's that's
[1:27:07] what the things that's what it thinks
[1:27:14] sometimes the young people thinks you
[1:27:16] are forcing certain things on them I
[1:27:19] have the desire to do this but I mean I
[1:27:22] mean the church this is why the church
[1:27:24] believe it it's not what the church
[1:27:26] believed is what comes by the new birth
[1:27:29] it has to leave if it is now flowing out
[1:27:33] of you which means you need to be born
[1:27:35] again it's not some kind of a card or
[1:27:41] something but let me assure you brothers
[1:27:46] let me assure you sisters let me assure
[1:27:51] you young people there may be a lot of
[1:27:54] mockery I don't say here is he I can say
[1:27:59] there I'm just a man and I know George
[1:28:04] I'm just I'm just to preach but there is
[1:28:09] a generally goes a journey or apostolic
[1:28:13] power of the Holy Spirit people may make
[1:28:18] a mockery out of faith you know that's
[1:28:20] the reason why I said in church I mean
[1:28:21] the one all all the men to wear white
[1:28:24] shirt and black pants you know as an
[1:28:27] identification or all the women to tie
[1:28:29] the I had no we just want you to be
[1:28:32] decent a man it must just flow out of
[1:28:35] you it must be something that you desire
[1:28:37] to do to live a decent life praise the
[1:28:43] Lord
[1:28:44] we're not forcing nothing down your
[1:28:46] throat praise the Lord I'm telling you
[1:28:49] if I fall sit down your Troy is going to
[1:28:51] run your stomach Amy first of all you
[1:28:55] better chew it little by little and have
[1:28:58] God to to help you digest it and have
[1:29:00] God to have it run through your veins so
[1:29:03] you can be able to live out I mean some
[1:29:05] people force this thing down their
[1:29:07] throat ear and their stomach and they
[1:29:08] got out of it
[1:29:09] praise the Lord this is that that's all
[1:29:14] we've been trying to do preaching all of
[1:29:16] these messages children of the promise
[1:29:19] children of the light all of this is to
[1:29:23] just encourage us that we are right at a
[1:29:26] place where we where we have the
[1:29:28] opportunity to experience God for our
[1:29:30] self you can experience God for yourself
[1:29:35] in your home you can believe for your
[1:29:41] loved ones some people think is just a
[1:29:47] market you know they're just there I
[1:29:51] mean I mean they have to get into a
[1:29:53] press situation I mean a
[1:29:56] life-threatening situation before they
[1:29:59] get serious for God you talk to them
[1:30:01] they just give you some kind of force
[1:30:02] matchy and I mean it not even spending
[1:30:05] time they can't even I mean just just
[1:30:08] meditate on God's Word spend time with
[1:30:11] God
[1:30:22] we all get spells and settle comes
[1:30:30] around and he tells you things sometimes
[1:30:33] I want it not not about you or he tells

[1:30:37] one and tells you thing about your house
[1:30:39] mother tells you thing about your wife
[1:30:41] and then you want to believe the devil
[1:30:43] of us word if you think that person is a
[1:30:48] child of God don't believe what the
[1:30:50] devil says no matter what they are doing
[1:30:52] believe what God's Word says believe
[1:30:55] God's promise that God is able to change
[1:31:00] the situation when we grow up and stop
[1:31:05] being crybaby amen we Jamie we just we
[1:31:10] just cry for every little things I mean
[1:31:17] it's time for us to stand on those
[1:31:18] promises stand on the promises this is
[1:31:23] that this is dead bird Bram talks about
[1:31:31] all of these things and that that man
[1:31:32] talking talking to that little girl and
[1:31:35] she said you know how do you know that
[1:31:36] you know that Jonah swallow
[1:31:38] you know or a fish swallow Jonah he she
[1:31:41] says because the Bible says it praise
[1:31:44] the Lord
[1:31:46] well I mean maybe it was just a story
[1:31:49] that the Bible was making she says no
[1:31:51] the Bible says that the Bible is the
[1:31:53] Word of God so I believe it praise the
[1:31:57] Lord
[1:32:02] she says well
[1:32:03] and I get to heaven you know talk to
[1:32:06] John about it he says what if Jonah is
[1:32:09] not in heaven and then she said you
[1:32:11] talked to him and you asked him about it
[1:32:18] because I know I'm going to heaven if
[1:32:21] he's not in heaven he's in hell then you
[1:32:23] talk to him about it
[1:32:28] she wouldn't I allowed a credit to spit
[1:32:30] in your face and you don't allow
[1:32:33] unbelievers who spit in your face about
[1:32:35] the promises of God tell them you never
[1:32:41] know about they don't tell you tasting
[1:32:43] you will not know if it's sweet or sour
[1:32:44] until you taste it don't tell me that
[1:32:47] there is no God I know there is a God
[1:32:49] because I'm alive that is the door of I
[1:32:59] mean a door of opportunity that is
[1:33:01] before us where balance is apostolic
[1:33:06] time is right before us it's at the door
[1:33:10] we can step into it you don't have to
[1:33:14] make up things just simple faith take
[1:33:19] God by His Word take God by His Word
[1:33:24] no matter how things are becoming
[1:33:26] negative and ugly you have to fight that
[1:33:28] mind battle I can get in your mind to
[1:33:31] fight I'm gonna have to preach the word
[1:33:32] when I leave from here I get out there I
[1:33:34] fight my own battles in my mind because
[1:33:38] the devil brings all sorts of things to
[1:33:39] my mind you have to take the word
[1:33:50] if you can remember no Bible verse stop
[1:33:53] singing me that will help you you pick
[1:34:01] up your pen write a love letter to Jesus
[1:34:04] that's why brother Branham did stick it
[1:34:10] up in your closet put it on your mirror
[1:34:12] oh you can even leave a note for the
[1:34:17] devil at your dome just write a big no
[1:34:19] sticking on your door when he gets there
[1:34:21] let him read it sit on you and I allow
[1:34:23] in here
[1:34:31] but that's the time that is before us
[1:34:34] it's right at the door God giving you us
[1:34:38] an opportunity that we can be able to
[1:34:41] experience you talking to a loved one or
[1:34:47] someone on the phone that is down and I
[1:34:49] mean feeling in me discouraged don't
[1:34:53] finish that conversation and just let
[1:34:55] them dry like that give them an
[1:34:57] opportunity you can pray with that
[1:34:59] person on the phone
[1:35:00] let me let just have a word of Prayer I
[1:35:04] mean there is the Regis
[1:35:06] there is just no human heart that is
[1:35:09] broken I don't care how evil that person
[1:35:14] is how much they hate God when they get
[1:35:16] to that breaking point and you see let
[1:35:19] us pray you just have to give in they
[1:35:24] would just have to give him but most of
[1:35:32] the time we are afraid we try to
[1:35:34] calculate things in our mind when we are
[1:35:38] just supposed to stand right there make
[1:35:41] ourself available
[1:35:44] that's how faith works you just you just
[1:35:47] got to make yourself available say Lord
[1:35:52] you say
[1:35:52] when I open my mouth you give me the
[1:35:54] right word to speak that's the time that
[1:36:00] is before us you can tell the devil this
[1:36:04] is dad
[1:36:07] I'm telling he's not going to believe it
[1:36:10] he's going to come again and bring
[1:36:12] another reason why this is not right you
[1:36:14] bring another reason why you know sit on
[1:36:16] sticks on his own belief for you to give
[1:36:20] into it and you have to stick on your
[1:36:23] belief you have to stick on your belief
[1:36:35] that devil and his gun
[1:36:38] I mean his shots they are just it's an
[1:36:41] empty book empty bullet he has he knows
[1:36:45] that that is the reason why when he
[1:36:49] starts shooting at you he just make a
[1:36:50] lot of noise just to have to make you
[1:36:53] afraid but he just know that one shot
[1:36:57] from of God's Word is able to blast him
[1:37:00] back to hell he knows that so when he
[1:37:04] start talking to your mind he just don't
[1:37:06] say one thing and keep quiet he don't
[1:37:09] know how to keep his mouth shut
[1:37:10] you have to know they're known about
[1:37:13] this devil he talks about this and he
[1:37:17] talks about that and he connected to
[1:37:18] this and he connected to that and he
[1:37:21] just go on and go on and go on because
[1:37:23] you enjoy hearing him talk sometimes you
[1:37:31] just have to be physical and shout shut
[1:37:34] up devil praise the Lord I mean it just
[1:37:40] not only send him to hell they send all
[1:37:42] his demons to hell because when he's
[1:37:43] died Ronnie
[1:37:44] the little ones knows that they got to
[1:37:46] get away from you sometimes you just
[1:37:50] have to get a hold of the situation
[1:37:52] don't allow the situation together all
[1:37:54] of you
[1:37:56] I mean that's the time that we are
[1:38:01] living in see these people scare for
[1:38:04] their life
[1:38:04] Roma's have gone all over the place that
[1:38:07] they have stole Jesus body and they are
[1:38:09] eating it
[1:38:10] the Pharisees came out with this lie the
[1:38:13] Roman government is now concerned there
[1:38:15] will be a plague these people are eating
[1:38:16] bodies they will go out of men and into
[1:38:19] the marketplace just like what we are
[1:38:21] dealing with they are afraid they are
[1:38:25] all looking out and watching for them we
[1:38:27] know how the dress we know how how the
[1:38:30] behaving how they go about and these
[1:38:33] people know these believers no they
[1:38:35] don't have no life until God comes down
[1:38:39] and fulfill his promise they have their
[1:38:44] loved ones out there they will not be
[1:38:45] able to go and see but you will realize
[1:38:48] what happened when the Baptistina of the
[1:38:51] Holy Ghost come I mean the Holy Ghost
[1:38:53] came down in the lake of fire upon these
[1:38:55] people nobody told them to get out even
[1:38:59] the ones that was shamed to testified of
[1:39:01] their faith they were standing in the
[1:39:03] street speaking Galilean language and it
[1:39:10] was not only the men even the women and
[1:39:12] the children that was among them I mean
[1:39:14] such an experienced sweep over the place
[1:39:20] don't tell me they were not children a
[1:39:22] more name they were children horsemen
[1:39:25] and why would they will leave their
[1:39:26] children with you know how the heart of
[1:39:29] mothers goes after their children they
[1:39:30] were now wicked to leave their children
[1:39:32] back the same way you bring your
[1:39:34] children to church that's the same way
[1:39:36] they have their children there in those
[1:39:37] prayer meetings they sister have a
[1:39:40] little place where to go and breastfeed
[1:39:42] their children but they all wanted the
[1:39:44] promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:54] when you've got this assurance India
[1:39:57] heart oh my goodness
[1:40:00] it was just like receiving a payment
[1:40:04] from the governor then now you can go
[1:40:07] anywhere in everywhere they were ready
[1:40:10] to go to their homes they were ready to
[1:40:12] face death in the face the new now this
[1:40:19] was their time this was their
[1:40:21] opportunity you read a book you know of
[1:40:28] the Mata you see all of those things
[1:40:30] that were happening but you also have to
[1:40:33] realize there were young believers in
[1:40:35] those days there were women in those
[1:40:42] days I mean there were young couples in
[1:40:45] those days it's the same thing
[1:40:49] the same time that we are living in but
[1:40:54] it was their time I mean you read the
[1:40:59] story in and and you see the some of
[1:41:03] them there I mean they were they were
[1:41:04] ready I mean I mean just out of time
[1:41:07] they knew that they were on a
[1:41:09] persecution I mean you you read those
[1:41:11] things some of them just got married and
[1:41:17] they were ready to go and and and face
[1:41:20] whatever their tribe was that's the time
[1:41:28] that we are living in apostolic time
[1:41:31] among us
[1:41:40] we can read it and imagine it but we
[1:41:46] have the opportunity to step by faith
[1:41:53] even a God will use us for one situation
