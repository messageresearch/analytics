grace that has kept us this way [Music] it is not because father oh god we deserve it lord but it's purely by grace purely by grace that we are saved through faith not of works [Music] father we are so very much grateful that you have preserved our lives and we have preserved our souls and have delivered us from untimely death and have delivered us from the just of the enemy and have delivered us father oh god from all the evil the enemy ever brought before us that we are before the father tonight to give you the praise [Music] because we know it is your making and not ours we bless you father tonight father we glorify thee and we exalt your holy name in the name of jesus our lord and savior for the next father for the few minutes that i have before before before you i pray that you would come down in a very mighty way and touch the lives of your sons and daughters we are not here to hear a man speak lord we are here to hear your voice come and say something that would encourage your children in the name of jesus father we pray with thanksgiving amen amen praise be to god as we stand can we take shall we take our bibles um hebrews 12. hebrews 12. musicians thank you and god bless you hebrews 12 1. while foreseeing we also are compassed about which so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do have so easily beside us and let us run with patience the race that has been set before us praise be to god shall we be seated yes it's good to see every one of you and god richly bless you all whenever one told me you have 20 25 minutes i was wondering what i was coming to say here um because i'm not good at time when i have too much time i use less and when i have less time i use more it's not deliberate that is what tall men do so maybe next time brother once you look at the height of the people and then [Music] praise be to god yes so tonight 20 minutes i just want us to encourage ourselves as we are entering the new year the very last portions of the scripture we just read 12th one says and let us run with patience the race that is set before us in fact if i have to title this at all i will just say let us run with patience praise be to god amen let us run with patience as we are entering the new year sorry i have to bring my phone up here is something i don't like doing i was trying to print something i couldn't just get it to work so in any case it's a mute so i promise you this phone will not rain until i live here so brother branham said in the exposition of seven church ages chapter 8 the philadelphian church he said revelation 3 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation we shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth what does he mean by the word of my patience hebrews 3 hebrews 6 13 to 15. for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swept by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained a promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word of god which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of abraham i don't know i have not timed myself it is just 9 18 we can run it off to 9 20 just for you know to make it easy for me to calculate praise be to god yes so um yes he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way god teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never lend patience but would become even more impatient with life yes i was just thinking about it if you prayed and god answered your prayer right there and then you but abraham said you will never lend patience as a matter of fact you'll be very impatient you know when you look at faith the substance of things hoped for i am not preaching tonight i just i'm just speaking if you look at the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen when you pray between the time you pray and the time you see the physical manifestation of the prayer there is time and that is where faith counts if you prayed and right there and then you see the result that is good we all like that but faith the evidence of things hoped for substance of things hopefully the evidence of this not seen you have prayed and you have believed it yet you have not seen it and you have believed that god has restored your ear and you are walking with one ear in the street and people are making fun of you and you tell them no the ear is there and they say but we don't see they are making fun of you and you keep believing that is why faith counts and i like this so very much when the prophet himself is saying that if god answered your prayer right there and then you'll be very very impatient in life let me show you this truth even more fully set forth in hebrews 11 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises the word of god offered up his only begotten son there it is abraham was tried after he received the word of promise must think must think that as soon as we pray in jesus name over the good promises of god that there could not be a trial but there it is that abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to samus to the psalmist referring to joseph psalm 105 19 until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him god gives us exceeding great precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we prayed until the time we got the answer we must learn to receive patience until our souls sorry into our souls for only in patience do we possess life praise be to god may god help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the safe age land patience we read the history of the lives of these christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome in impatience and haste in this day and age if you want the most impatient people you will think they are the people in the streets you will find them in the house of god very very impatient people are just so impatient with life on the highways sometimes when you are late for work you have a scores you can give a course you can give a reason but other times you are 30 minutes ahead of time and yet you just speed and then go and get to you go to the parking lot just to park and sit down there and do nothing sometimes you are driving behind somebody and they are just driving according to the speed limit and you are behind and you want to run them over praise be to god i see somebody smiling and looking somewhere praise be to god yes god have mercy yes yes and sometimes you get so impatient with them till when you are overtaking them you don't even go you look across and it's not to smile at them or to say hi i think all of us do it right sometimes you just catch them and you wish they just drove off the cliff you know i was listening to radio one time and i heard the presenter say something he said he was driving behind a guy and the man was so slow and he was so impatient but then when he looked at the number plate he saw a wounded warrior so one traffic cleared in the left lane and he came in there and he got to his window he slowed down a little and looked across and it was a very old man with prosthetics the artificial hand is that how you call it beautiful and he was driving with artificial hand and so when he saw it his heart dropped into his stomach he said oh my goodness we are so impatient with life learn to be patient with yourself learn to be patient with others and above all learn to be patient with god because when god is dealing with you you don't know the program of god you don't know how god works a lot of the times we try to explain it we try to explain the inexplicable and god is working just you are just a clay in his hand that he is breaking a piece here just trying to murder here more you there and you are there and you are shouting and you are yelling and you are complaining all day long so so so impatient very very impatient there was a story i'm left with 14 minutes praise be to god yes yes it was a very good reason there was a very good reason why but one made me to come first yes so there was a married couple they had stayed together for a while and god had not yet blessed them with a child so one day the man told his wife he said honey you know we've been together for a very long time and now god has not blessed us with any children and we are poor so you know what let me travel just go and then hustle somewhere come and then get you a decent home you know in the villages the roof will touch um sleep on you know these uh sometimes even the bed is sometimes even made of grass yeah sometimes cutting and then you lie on it for so many years and then you are lying on it that part of you is up part of you is down i wonder how you get good sleep yes i slept on it a lot so so you know what i'll come and build your home and in all these village homes it's just sometimes there is no dog yes you know what i'm talking about sister so that the wife said okay i agree so this man left he found a very rich man and he told the rich man you know what you are taking care of me you have a place for me to sleep you give me food to eat the money you are going to pay me just keep it until i am ready to leave then you give it to me because i made my wife a promise that i would come back and build her home make her happy so this man agreed so he worked for seven years and then he was ready to go home and he told them man i am ready to go back then the man said you know what i would advise you to wait for seven more years is it seven more years at this point it looks like we are talking about jacob isn't it he said no it's too much you say you know what i have a very good reason if you can do it for seven more years in fact i am going to double your pay i want you to go back very happy it was very difficult because the man wanted to see his wife he said i choose to stay and then he stayed for another seven years and now 14 years away from his wife and when he got through the further that he was going to go his master came and sat with him thinking he was bringing the money and the master came with a very big bag with three loaves of bread very big lots of bread then the master said you have been a very very good servant to me i'm going to miss you a lot but you know what i want you to choose between the two either i give you your money or i'm going to give you an advice in place of the money he said what i have wait for 14 years and you give me an advice for money he said yes choose i'm not going to choose why but you choose but the man was so good to the servant so much so that he looked at him the father figure that he was to him so rich and amanda feared god he looked at him and he said you know what give me the advice then the man said okay i'm going to keep the money the advice is that learn to be patient in life the librarians have an adage that the patient dog is the fattest bone because back home the dogs we have they are very very good at math [Music] i think every dog in africa if you ask them to calculate the area of a triangle they'll do it for you because your hand goes to the bowl they are looking at it you go to the soup they are looking at it you come to the mouth they are looking at it they don't give you a chance to eat so if you have a stubborn dog and he's doing that you think you give that dog the biggest bone no you reserve the big bone for the cool one that's what they mean the patient dog is the fattest bone and we have one in ghana they say if you have patience you can actually cook stone and drink the soup who cooks stone no one cooks stone all it means is that with patience the impulse the impossible things in life can become possible so the master said i'm keeping the money but be patient in life and with patience you are going to succeed that is all i have for you but take these three loaves of bread you are going to eat one on your way it is taking you three weeks to work i have eight minutes it is taking you three weeks to walk home i am giving you you are eating one loaf of bread the second one i will not tell you what happened to it but the third one keep it until you get home even if you are dying keep it till you get home and you will not eat it alone you are going to eat it with your wife he said good he took it when he left he said oh what just happened i worked for 14 years and all i have is just an advice be patient in life and you will succeed and three loaves of bread what has happened did i did i did that did i did i choose the writing and then he just left with his gallon of water just walked met other people they were all walking in the same direction between after the second week they relaxed somewhere in the night and people just came on horses surrounded the whole place and ransacked everything they had they took everything their money their their goals everything and when they got to him he said i have nothing they searched him there was nothing they said what do you have here it's a loaf of bread i worked for my master 14 years he sent me away with nothing he said oh they saw that he had started eating one already they said you know what um you are just a poor guy and then they took the second one so it was there now he said oh okay so that means if i had taken the money that was the end here a lot of the times we think we know better than god the word of god tells you something and you think you have a better option this journey we are traveling nobody has ever traveled this journey but one he knows the end from the beginning and the word of god says something and you want to give your own interpretation to it god tells you one thing and you want to do the other and you think you can outsmart god you can never even outsmart your own self you know by now you guys know i love stories one day my little son emmanuel came from school he said daddy i have a story do you want to hear it i said yes he said there was a family that was living and then a man just came to the family and said you this guy here you are the next to die you are the next on my list and then he brought a long list with their names pinned on it and then the family just started wailing they loved their dad so much and their dad was going to pass so they said well you didn't bring us any good news but you know what sit down and let's entertain you and then he sat down and then they entertained him he ate he was very happy and then after he had eaten he just sat down and slept and while he was sleeping the family members went and took the name from the top and went and put it down their last name so now this angel in the form of a man got her from his sleeve and then he called the family members together and he said you guys know what oh you guys have been so good to me you guys are very very nice you have made me very happy because of what you have done i'm not going to start from the top anymore [Laughter] [Music] i'm starting from the bottom [Music] don't think you can ever a smart god always ask for grace always ask for grace my time is telling me i have three minutes more praise be to god three minutes yes yes praise god so so when the man left there i need to summarize at this point i think i told you guys one time that when i was in i was not good at summary if you gave me 10 sentences to summarize i'll give you 20. so god help me so at this point he said oh so my master has helped me he was very grateful for the advice very grateful then he got home when he got home it was very very early in the morning and then he went these village rooms a lot don't have windows peeped through the window and his wife was lying down and beside his wife was this young guy that was lying beside his wife he just went from zero to hundred and then he started thinking so much evil and he wanted to go there and butcher the people but he thought of it that be patient in life and you will go very far be patient he fought against himself but he said you know what for 14 years i worked and i exchanged all my wages for this advice be patient in life you know what i am going to be patient amen he waited it was their break he entered the house his wife woke up he said you traitor you traitor i've been away for 14 years is that what you do and then you stop so honey he said don't honey me come on just started blasting and then this young guy gets up he said mommy who is this man as soon as he said mommy who is this man then the man just froze he said who is this he said that was that is your son he said i was pregnant i didn't know and when you left we didn't know where you were how to get you and this is the son 14 years old they say oh my goodness i was going to butcher you guys to death patience patience learn to be patient in life as we are entering the time says i'm left with one minute brother jordan promised me five minutes of his time he was very gracious and i know brother brother i would be very gracious to him too praise be to god yes so he just started crying they just tried crying they just started hugging so oh i am so so sorry and then he was so happy a very happy man and then when they had just cried and cried and cried and they finished they sat down so honey you know what i am so happy i didn't come with money but i'm so happy that the advice i was giving to be patient in life is what is keeping all of us alive today because it would have been a different story and then he told the wife the story he said but you know what this man said one thing that when i come home i should keep this bread when i get home i shouldn't eat it on the road i should get home before i eat it you know what we are going to eat this bread together they brought a knife when he put the knife through started cutting it got to the middle it wouldn't cut there was something inside when he broke it it was a a good bar that was in the middle he said what was that what my master did for me and they started celebrating praise be to god the secret was kept away from him until he had gone through the trial he didn't know all along when he was going through what he was carrying he didn't know what he was carrying whatever trial it is that you may be going through whatever problems it is that you may be going through whatever situation that you may be going through go with patience run the race with patience because you do not know what lies are end ahead at the end of the trial there is a good bar awaiting presbyter thank you lord jesus i'm sure brother one i am amen amen praise the lord i believe that bread was the word of god amen praise the lord i believe that bread was the word and in breaking the bread you would get the gold bar amen if you just bear passion just be patient praise the lord romans chapter 5 verse 3. romans chapter 5 verse 3 tells us how we can get patient very quick the secret have to get patient very quick let's read that and not only so but we glory in tribulation also ignoring that tribulation working patient that's a that's a secret to get patient pray for trius [Music] praise the lord that's the secret to patience the secret to patience is for you to get hard time the lord it's for you to get hard time you see most of the time you hear people say god is trying my patient god is not trying your patient because you don't have patience you are not born with patience you don't have it right god is giving you he's teaching you patience he's not trying your patience you don't have patience amen praise the lord brother hope you don't have passion [Music] praise the lord i say hope you don't have passion praise the lord amen but i believe that was a wonderful teaching that amen we appreciate brother damn for daddy man james chapter 1 verse 3 says faith worketh passion when our faith is trying so what actually it is is god is trying his word in you and the triad of that word then produce a vector that is called patient praise the lord so it's all wrapped around god and his word and you have nothing to do with it god made a promise in his word and he's trying to bring that word to pass by putting you in a circumstance so that word can come to pass praise the lord that's all it's just god in his word and you are caught in the middle but because god do not fail his word is going to come to pass if you just surround there and say lord bring your word to pass in me but if you try to fight it then now it becomes more tougher because that word will still come to pass [Music] praise the lord statue of the peppermint brother branham said this he said uh [Music] you know he was teaching on patient he says patient with what what kind of a patient he said the first thing is having patience with god having patience with god because it's god that is breaking his promise to pass there is no way you can force it to happen before the the time that god wanted to happen praise the lord amen as a dan ready in that quote he says learn to receive patient so we learn to receive patient and the way you learn is to be taught [Music] amen so let's run this race let's run with patient the race that is set before us let's stand on our feet tonight amen we want to thank the lord for that we pray that god would teach us more patience amen by putting us in difficult circumstances that's the thing that we get the bride you know they're out of here you know when that when that press come upon us when their squeeze come upon us is going to produce such an attribute with god praise the lord father we just want to thank you for your word we say god we we we commit ourselves in your hands lord you are the master oh god that have trained us lord from the dead of our birth lord to some of god it has been 30 years to psalm it's 20 years to some lord jesus and father it will be all the days of our life and we will abide in the house of the lord forever in jesus name we pray amen let's let's play

and i'm so happy to be here amen and as you know sometimes when they give you a new puppy like this a new church you get nervous because you know all the eyes on you was okay what these guys are going to talk tonight about so so and i'm so grateful to be here so and um it's by the grace of god that's why we're here so yeah we may sit a little bit down just a little bit uh so i just present myself here so my name is brother joseph armani joseph is is my is my middle name so but i prefer people to call me by joseph so but my first name is musha galusa my last name is armani so even at work everybody called me joseph because nobody can pronounce my first name correctly so i prefer just people call me joseph so uh i came from houston texas uh since uh february of this year and um after i finished school and then i went to wisconsin green bay that's where i was and i did my fellowship there at aurora bay care after my fellowship and then uh we were expecting our third child elia he was born uh like a month ago and at that time since you were just me and my wife in in pennsylvania and uh basically uh there in wisconsin and we say that since we are only here by ourselves we need to be close to a family so and then we say that we need to go close to a family and fortunately my family family-in-law is here in a minia police area so and we moved straight over here and i was fellowshipping with brother joe so i think he's a spoken word church that's why i will fellowship and i was preaching there too as well and when we were ready to come over here so i told brother joe i think he looks like we gotta go to uh minneapolis because we need to be close to the family so therefore that's when he gave me the number of brother uh one and a couple of one i say brazil one i'm gonna be there so and uh i just i just need to make sure that you know i have a place where i can worship and you know that's what brother branham said president said that a true christian whenever you try to move to any place make sure the first thing you do is to call that place and find out if there's a place where you can worship because you can live in a city but if you don't have a place where you can worship you're gonna just be like a shepherd without a guard so you're going to just be there and you're going to be looking and you're going to end up fellowship with people who you can fellowship with so and i always make sure whenever i move around and make sure that i call and make sure that i have a place where i can worship and i'm so grateful i found my family here so brothers and sisters here they are really my family and when my wife delivered the baby and then really i saw a big support from the church your prayers and i really say thank you so much and may god bless you because it was very hard for me to combine work and family so having two small children and going to work at the same time so it was not really uh easy for me so and also fortunately me and brother one we work in the same building so sometime by the time i want to cry i just go to his office and cry to his office down there so because he works in a um in a basement somewhere so and then i just go there and then just have lunch together and then trying to encourage me and uh sister there uh um cnn megan's sister yeah yeah sister eunice you know she was always come to spend time with my wife and a couple other sisters you know they came over and that was really a blessing i really want to say thank you and may god bless you for that so i can't really have anything to give you but just to pray for you and for the love and the support that you you show for my for my family is that means a lot for me so thank you so much and in houston texas i used to fellowship with uh brother zoe uh i think brother ariel know brother zoe so he's uh he's my pastor there in houston texas and uh i was still in contact and we uh and i was i was one of the preacher there too as well so it was really a good um a good time for me now to move up and to come on this side of the town and uh tonight i just want to say something which is something very common i think uh when uh the other brother was here he was talking about patience and i know patience is something that we all need in life and since today is just something that we can encourage each other on and since is the end of the year and in couple hours we're going to be in 2022 so i want to just say that the patient that she was talking about here i experience it experience it because before i came here united states i was a refuge refugee i was in a camp refugee in uganda so how many of you been refugees yeah so a refugee is someone who needs who you have is a must to have patience because you don't know what you're gonna eat tomorrow you depend on someone you depend on on a u.n agency to give you something so you are hoping to eat but you don't know what you're gonna eat and for me i used to live in a camp refugee it was like in a wood-ness like desert so nobody like there's no tree and we had a lake that have you seen a green water green lake and it was smelling so they had to treat that water for that order to become white but when you go to school they teach you that water doesn't have a color but we had a water with a color green and it was smelling and functions everywhere by patience we used to have people coming in that country refugee and the same day they get there to say no i'm not i can't live here they're out and since we knew that there was a resentment in the camp refugee to come in united states now you gotta wait you see now if you put that one in spiritual form it's a same thing rapture is gonna come rapture rapture rapture there was a brother in this message i'm telling you i think he was i heard a story he was already like 54 years old he believed a message since he was like 10 years old and he said you guys keep preaching about rapture rapture rapture i'm 54 today but i never see the rapture happening now i'm about to die and really he died because he didn't have a passion he didn't know when the rapture is going to come but you have to keep waiting on god amen and this message was really powerful i think that's what i was thinking about to say today i'm going to just encourage people to do you know to be patient and exactly that's what brother he was talking about and i was that camp refugee and just wait you go to the office you just tell them your story and they say okay thank you bye you go home you wait you don't know when they're gonna put your name on that board again there to say you have a second interview just wait if i wasn't patient i couldn't be here today i was patient patient every single day and you go knocking those though what's happening with my case we don't know yet you go back home you came back again tomorrow you ask them i said we don't know yet the only answer is we don't know until your name will come up on the board they'll never tell you what's going on with your case and here we are today here i am meeting brothers and sisters here i am i have a family if i could say you know what no no i can't stay here let me just go where i'm coming from so where i will be today i don't know so that's just was just something that i just want to cover there about patience so we gotta be patient but tonight i want to talk to you about something else so we're going to go to look let's stand on our feet please it's something that is usual very usual look 17 30. when i read luke 17 30. now read in the name of follow jesus christ even that shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed 31 in that day he we shall be up be upon the house on in that day he wish shall be upon the house top and his staff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he shall in the field let him likewise no return back let's go to second telus desalination chapter 2 seconds desalination chapter 2 the verse 9 the verse chapter 2 verse 9. even him does coming after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivedness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they believe no they they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved let's pray lord jesus christ thank you again for your word tonight i'm just a speaker god but in this speaking god we need a life god may you come again and say amen to your own word god because we want to see we want to hear from you guys tonight oh my lord my god may you put me away god and let your people hear from you we say thank you to thee in the name of lord jesus christ we pray amen let me see so i want to just talk to you about get ready get ready you know when you are i can say when you're a student and you want to pass an exam what do you do i think i have many young people here and i just come from school you study right so you study why why are you studying because you're preparing something so you want to be ready for want to be ready for what brother for your exam so be ready as yours are going as yours are passing by and our lord is coming amen so don't be distracted and i'm gonna tell you tonight that the devil has developed many strategies to deceive the children of god he has developed many and tonight i'm going to show you how he has developed those strategies and as a children of god we should know how the devil developed those strategies because you can say i believe the message that is not enough brother that is not enough my sister i believe the message the devil believed their message yes the devil knows who brother branham is amen amen amen the devil knows jesus christ but he doesn't believe him he doesn't believe jesus christ amen amen amen so now what kind of strategies the devil has back then yours if you can go in the old testament if you sin you commit a sin god used to kill people physically amen amen he kills you straight i'm married man i go outside my marriage god keeps me straight the next day brother joseph is not the anymore and everybody will know that joseph may be young maybe he went outside his marriage that's why god and if that one would be publicly everyone would know joseph slept with somebody else that's why god killed him that's how god used to kill people back then to punish people whenever you commit a sin but today is not the same today god has changed strategy as well so deep brother today the devil has entered in a church and as the devil entered in the church he distracted the church because he knew when jesus christ went when jesus christ returned and he said that i will send my holy ghost the holy ghost came in a church now the devil his neck in a church too as well and he ended in a church and when he entered a church now everybody was distracted now you know why brother branham came because as you can see from the beginning when jesus christ left the disciples and he gave them the commission to go preach the whole world the church was strong and as they were preaching the roman empire starts killing one after one and they were killing that's why we have just because we don't have the table here the seven church edges you could see how the light was going down little by little because the devil entered in the church and scrambling the scriptures so all disciples were killed and as they were killed the light of god was going to small by small small by small now god had to restore again the word of god amen how is going to restore the word of god is by sending their prophets and that prophet does luke 17 30. because he was the requirement was the restoration of the whole gospel nothing left that's why to this day we didn't need with no need a transformer we needed a prophet someone who god will talk to and someone who will restore the whole gospel because the church was lost so now back then when god used to kill people physically just kill you physically today is not the case today those who don't believe that means they don't have the thirst of the word of god and when you don't have the thoughts of the word of god that means you are dead you must have the thirst of the word of god for you to be here tonight amen not just brother there's nothing you can do because doctors does what that's what is inside you that's the seed of god in you that thoughts that's what say amen to the word it's not you brother no because you have something from god inside you that inside that's something that's what you're saying amen i don't have time to go through coats right now you can spend the whole night here i have few minutes president brother branham said the farmer who went and took the egg off the ego he put in a chicken and the chicken had the baby the little egg the little ego now the mother was looking for my egg where's my egg he couldn't find the egg after cowboy couple days or a couple months now the baby was there now the baby because the baby chicken and the baby ego are different so therefore the food that chicken eats is not the same food as the ego eat when the chicken was gonna give some food and say what do you eat no ego eat fresh yes fresh meat fresh food ego don't eat junky food right no that's right no that's why you need a fresh gospel that's why they call us eagles yes and at that time the ego was between among the chicken but it was not comfortable the ego was saying like nah this food now it was too junky going to bathroom all the time because it was too much the stomach was crumbling something was not right because the food that he was eating was not a good food that's why brother you know uh i'm gonna tell you one thing one day in the camp refugee i was talking to one brother his name is guillaume this brother he lives in uh wisconsin appleton this brother i think she was less younger than me i think he was at that time he was 15 years old i think i'm three years old than him so he he came to my house and he said brother i don't know why i don't catch what the pastor preached and i told him that means that is not your house he was like what i say if you can see what he's preaching that means that is not your house brother he said okay now can you tell me something i said okay you come sunday with me you're gonna see and brother i'm telling you this brother guillaume he's in wisconsin maybe one day he's going to come over here this brother this that day we went to church together he never returned back again amen when you come there brother he was the first day he was like he was the end of the church this brother was shouting and i was like what's going on this is your first day he was jumping around everywhere the brother was on fire two weeks later he was baptized until and the same thing now now when the chicken was when the ego was among the chickens it was not comfortable and when he was not comfortable he said i need my mother i need to go home now one day her mother was flying in a city when that big ego was crying that is like the word of god the word of god is going who's gonna say i'm here i'm present and that's the same thing when the mother eagle was crying he was looking for the chat amen where's my child where's my child the chicken they couldn't understand the language of the mother ego but the little ego could understand you say ah no no no no something's not right i'm hearing something the mother cried again she stopped he said no i think there's something no i'm hearing no i think that's that's my mother and then after that she saw her mom and he said mother i'm here but the chicken they could understand the language hey come on here no no no no no no no i'm not coming no i'm not coming anymore hey this is some cigarette now no no no no no no this time shot scout no no no no no no no no no all this is saying no to all that hey let's go see something no no no more gossiping here you are saying no to all that and he said can you fly i said yes mother i'm gonna try i said okay do something i'm gonna help you out and she starts flapping the wings and he go she flew and her mother picked her up and they went that's what the word of god is doing today you must have the thoughts of the word of god for you to be ready that thirst because that thoughts is the transformation it's going to transform your life you can't even eat when you are thirsty you can't because if you don't have water you're gonna feel like no there's no something need to come over here and when you don't have the thoughts of the word of god brother you are wasting your time i'm not here to discourage you brother but you gotta found that thoughts of the god the word of god in you pray that god gave me that that thirst i need a thought god i'm looking for you that's the seed of god inside you that's what make you say you know what today is sunday today is wednesday let me wake up and pray because you have that task he keep telling you the right thing to do for god you don't do something that's not right no that thought is keep telling you this is not right it keep convincing you how to leave this message now since the gospel was lost my precious brother now to this end time according to luke 17 30 we receive a prophet who's gonna come exactly with the message because there's there's three i can't preach right now it's gonna take my temper someone is gonna kick me out here remember there's three appellations of psalms the son of man son of god and son of david gotta be careful here when he's coming in luke 17 30 he's a prophet son of man that means a prophet amen amen son of david is when you come in a millionaire amen amen amen so that's another preaching there but we got to be ready as years are going brothers and sisters we gotta be ready and how we're gonna be ready have the thirst speak to god have patience in you tell god i'm hoping on you i'm waiting on you you got to be ready every single time because you don't know when it's going gonna be you don't know when it's gonna happen and this strategy that the devil has developed in a church he came in a church and he convinced people with the wrong scriptures he twists the scriptures the little thing that people can do in the church in the right way but the devil came and he twisted a little bit so people can feel good i don't have to preach to make you feel good because we know that we live in a sin and when we come in this house we have to feel guilty yes it's a choice to come here because we want to correct our lives every single day that's why you want to be ready i mean i mean because every day when you go out what you see is a scene everywhere brother you walk in the street you seen a sin you can ask yourself why a lot of marriage are falling apart because of sin we see sin for like i can say for five days in a week but only one day we came over here so now everything that we saw say god please i don't want to remember this god god please god amen god doesn't care about your feelings but god cares about who do what god cares about those who respect his words he doesn't care about your feelings and what the devil has done as you can see today if you turn your tv the devil has done the first miracles that's why we wrote in in second television i mean i mean the devil has done a lot of false miracles but remember jesus christ said it's not those who call me father father that's do we enter but those who keep the will of my father they will enter amen amen amen just want to encourage you tonight be ready amen keep a good faith have the patience tell god i'm hoping on you i'm waiting on you every single day because the fight that we have brother is more than second world war two is more than what covid can do to us it's more than that because your soul is worth more than 10 million word only one soul i mean amen that's why i'm here tonight to tell you that as years are going very soon we're going to be 2022. what are you asking for god for this year to come the behavior that you had god what i was doing in 2021 i want to go down a little bit i want to be someone that god you can look at and be proud of me develop a personal experience with god you gotta found that personal experience you've got if you have that brother you'll always remember where you're coming from because you have that personal experience of god is like a love letter between you and god because you have that relationship you have that experience with him every single day you keep remem remembering and that's what bring the thoughts of his word inside you that's my encouragement tonight and may god bless you god bless you brother amen lord prepare me [Music] you went [Music] for you oh lord prepare me to be ascend to you where [Music] tried and true [Music] i'll be [Music] the scripture says the bride make herself ready amen praise the lord the bride make herself ready and like we know from the book of esther all of those things that were needed for the bride was given to them for them to make themselves ready praise the lord and that's the reason why the wedding ceremony we create an expectation the bride is the last one that comes in and then the marriage officer go right into the wedding so i pray that the lord who we help us and we will take his word and get ourselves ready for a rapture amen get ourselves ready for our deliverance from this body to bring every desire subject to the word of god amen every desire of the flesh let's buy our hearts and pray heavenly father we just want to thank you lord for the hesitation of our brother father we want to thank you of god for sending lord jesus your word in our day father lord and we just believe of god and that us we've been taught to god that the messenger of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 we do two things lord he will reveal those hidden mysteries from the foundation of the world and it's those healing types not our imagination is not our interpretation father god is not how we preach it it's not father lord how lazy we are but there is there is divine substance that is in that word or god that is going to literally literally change us to god father we believe lord in a literal transformation that comes to love from your word is something that you do in the human heart it's not how much effort we can put in it but how much we can surround us to your will how much we can receive your word father just like our brother said we pray you said in your word blessed is he that hunger and test for righteousness all you want us to do is to just grow a desire to test for you father we pray to god because when we test there is food in abundance for us to be fed with and so god we pray that lord father lord as we go into this coming year you will increase our desire for your word you will give a spiritual appetite oh father where we can get along with god father pick up our bible pick up a message book lord or father get and we can just feed on those things lord be like oh god revelation 10 8 john was told to eat the book father help us lord that god we can find pleasure in eating your word of god and father because that is the only thing the human soul will live off of so we thank you tonight we appreciate you father in jesus name we pray amen let's stand on our feet praise the lord amen [Music] praise the lord let's sing that song whatsoever you need god have it amen praise the lord when i call the song name the musicians can be looking at one another and says where is he coming from again which one is this praise the lord [Laughter] amen you just

maybe we just read some god and bless us our heart in jesus christ's name i pray amen maybe say that yeah sister let us have one caught me i just we just read code and we finish praise the lord are you happy to be in the presence of the lord i don't know there is a thing happening in 20 minutes i don't know where to start okay let's ask the reading praise god praise god come on now are you happy to be the president of the lord hallelujah i don't know where to start hallelujah hey hey praise god you get a new spirit you quit your drinking you get a new spirit you quit your drinking lying you get a new spirit you can do most of anything with that spirit but that isn't that god's talking about a new spirit he said i give you now watch i'll give you a new spirit and your heart and the new spirit why it had to give you a new spirit to live for you for him why you couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit that's what the brother was preaching about and you did have you couldn't live with your neighbor you couldn't associate with the next man on the next corner you couldn't associate with this christians why you'd have i had a awful spirit so he had to give you a new spirit i'll give you a new heart a new spirit now watch and i will put my spirit in you the the different i'll put my spirit in you and there where you found it so hard that you go down to church and you get a different concept you know that i believe and ought to go to the church praise the lord grab the end of the road if i can take my title in a few minutes uh just if you don't finish it okay you can just and cut out i don't want to finish all the code i just i like the light and we go so why is it so hard for a christian to live a christian life you take that anger so uh it's like a homework for us for new year drop down for the lord praise god we take another angle there is encouragement there is something what i i love the way intro is already introduced my preaching encouraging you i said we didn't come get to make you to feel good though you come you feel good to come to church right and the intro is this one is that we this is the holy spirit so let us go to that one you can feel us a little bit right grab them for the lord amen amen praise god praise god hallelujah i just i feel jumping you know come on now if there is a a place where we can be happy is in the presence the place that we can just smile is the presence of god so for me i'm okay if you can say until five o'clock i'm okay i'm the first one we can go and another sister hallelujah praise god and decide i didn't sing are you ready [Applause] sister let's go to number three i'm just checking my time i still have a seven minute okay just mastered i'm very very sensitive to time i don't know why very if they say 45 minutes when i start to cross 45 minutes i start feel checked i don't know my level today i just please brother five minutes from you okay right good he gave me five minutes so okay please good wonderful so we can go you don't lie you don't steal you got as i said and you're lovely and you got the peace joy and the law suffering now the prophet is trying to show us the new spirit and his spirit breath i don't want to read the law of god sister you can just remove can we're going to judge jump there is a lot of code can you imagine in 20 minutes i have got all this paper can you imagine crazy a lot of things in my mind so in fact when you are a christian is a process christianity is a process that's why there is a patient is a process now when god is working to somebody then that person must wait upon the lord and when you're waiting upon the lord is busy renewing you know the scripture until you reach to the perfect stature of men so now i want to show you that sometimes people they get the new spirit they thought that that is the holy spirit that's where we get a problem in the now we don't preach to the pentecostal i i love the way i put that away the brother they said they they they they were sneak already we have a of preachers behind the pulpit i'm telling you if you don't see them you are not you don't they are behind that's why you must have a spirit of checking don't judge a person by the church by the tribal by tribe it came from that person by the spirit he can be the right church good pastor good spirit but even you've got the wrong spirit and be anointed with a genuine holy spirit come on now clap the hand for the lord that's the dangerous time we've got right now that's why sometimes someone was very holy 30 years in the message wholly for it after they quit i never believe anymore i just quit that holy spirit was around his spirit that holy spirit never dropped in the soul we are talking about the soul the soul must come first hallelujah it's about a love affair when you love the lord he gonna just lead you to himself but now you can't complain and ever excuse us because somebody is in the message he quit the message if all it do this that's not your business mind your own business way but when he's doing that you think when someone fall in this sin you check yourself you also you are weak with some also you are also back by tas you are also a gag rajas i don't know that's my english don't worry you have a grudge you know those things whatever so all those things is to help you to stand and not to think wrong about people all of us will have a quick slang sling we can slink so when somebody fall look at your side which side are you sweet pray for yourself this is your self matter it's not about your brother it's not your sister it's about yourself [Music] you are busy gossiping about others when you are worse than the one you are causing [Applause] praise god hallelujah praise god come on now oh my my my my clapton for the lord praise god time you know time go ahead i just want to jump i know sister she's ready there just wanna jump scriptures let the one we go after let me just read this someone somewhere there is a kadesh banner sister number seven that's my style me i don't follow oda i just put in this order but they know me very well another seven they jump they go to seven hallelujah god bless you brother and decision you are so blessed for us i don't know god's keeping long and give you a desire for your heart claim this for the lord number seven all right number seven are you okay with number seven that's my second okay oh you you always fantastic praise god and that's where a great bunch of our trouble lay today we could put our finger on it is men and the woman women who come into church and profess to be believers and they are not believers i ever found it in the pulpit i've found it in a prayer line i've found it in everywhere where men come in and the women who said i am a believer and profess to be a believer and they are not believers that's a very horrible situation in the state we are in so it is not about you say you are a believer you are already a believer is a process so what prabhupada said so is he realized that people they are they they they lack only churches they come to church they hear about the word they go back the same they are about the word they go back the same now the holy spirit the danger now we are living today is that the genuine holy spirit can anoint the devil one the genuine holy spirit can anoint the saint one genuine i'm not talking about the ghost that's right that's the danger when there is a atmosphere god come down and then they start to operate and work and all of them they jump they scream miracles whatever but by their fruit we shall know them that's life that's why when there is a life of god there is god amen because without the life wherever you do miracles whatever you can jump whatever you can preach whatever you can do but if there is no life we have a question mark like we love you you know judas also was our brother jesus never said call judas devil himself you have a right to call him one of you is a devil but he didn't tell you to call jesus devil there is a three kind of believer sitting here which side are you my brother which side are you my sister the message of the hour has come it's come down it's transforming you the people so when they touch your side you become angry to the preacher or to the what's wrong why why did you why did you come here we need some preaching to shake you it will make you to down your knees and pray we are living in the age where we must manifest the god in our life i'm sick and tired touching wednesday the sunday we are the same no ways come on now [Applause] myself i've been sick and tired something must happen something must have happened cleveland for the lord please god you know sometimes it's not good to follow news it's not good when you're following the news if it's if there is a waste and more problem is in the assembly of the message today more than a pentecostal if i start to tell you stories you will be shocked he knows we always hear so what happened the devil is sneaking he become a preacher judas also and he went to preach he chased also demons judas was sanctified judas was was justified sanctified was a virgin they among among peers and others they came rejoicing he said hey guys don't rejoice why because the gen that's a dangerous part the genuine holy spirit can anoint the dev i've got quotations i don't want to read it i don't have time if you need quotation i want to give if you want but it's not about quotations it's about you the quotation must be a man walking hallelujah the quotation must be a sister walking the devil is late because the message now it's working on the streets hallelujah that's their praise god grab them for the lord amen [Applause] glory be to god amen leadership sister uh god 11. so we are organizing with them 11 wow oh praise the lord so he said they that cannot stand just men are bastards the children and not the children of god see they are worked up on the emotion see they see that i walked about a while ago that soul wasn't there to start with it was anointed with the spirit and it done all kinds all you did when your spirit's anointed you can it's the real genuine holy spirit and you could still be yes sir that one i have to read it i didn't want to jump so the time we are living it's a horrible time now the dangerous part is the children of god we always said god always a god always make uh full christians yeah i believe that god never make a half christian i believe that oh everything is good is it fine but there is i always like those shocking code those people they don't read too much i always give it to myself let us receive five i like code because there there is no discussion i said this this preachers there was too much on us they saw that we will because as we are sitting and they own us do you believe the message of our sister if you believe the measure of the how we believe brother branham your prophet and the god to speak this time through his prophet malachi william marion and everything he said we don't discuss we believe that's why our culture is the message of the hour your culture forget your tribe for gate the message of yahweh is our culture home praise god [Applause] don't mind me just like you if you are a christian that's where i am yes total deliverance just like you if i a christian god doesn't make any halfway creation god make completely christians it doesn't talk about the devil this is easy children that's where i'm going go that don't make us we're preacher but the preacher can be halfway and the god makes his children christians but sometimes they are halfway creation do you believe the prophet left the hand for the lord but it's not good intention for them to be that way it's their own way got mixed up with the plan of god for their life and that's what makes them the the way they are god don't want them to be the halfway christians of halfway preachers by compromising on that and side on was them completely stand it preach amen amen sometimes ourselves we can be up way that's why sometimes sometimes the the will sometimes we lack we be chosen before the of the world or the children of god sometimes you can delay yeah sometimes you can delay your growth and we are going to the rapture rapture is ready and there is a process so we have to look for the last one to enter but sometimes you can see the last one is and the pentacles is outside maybe the last one is sitting on the bench delaying is to afterward creation [Music] that's why i like this coat i just bring it sometimes we have to balance yes we have chosen but we are living in it through anthony through moral urgency so you have to choose sometimes you are so lazy with your work sometimes you you don't wanna to hear your mistake when they preach about repentance you become angry why you don't want people to preach about repentance why are you hiding you don't want to repent without repentance how can you be holy god love the repentant heart so if you don't have repentance heart sister brother is not your place no matter the scene it's gonna cost your marriage you have to repent because you must to be with god my forever sister brother your master your wife is going to run away because you could that one that there you never tell this what i'm gonna die with it yeah without your faith your faith is something you don't know your faith is more than your wife more than your husband god doesn't see your mistake mister can happen to everybody but the way you fix it that's the way god look at it you don't want to be a holy i don't want to have a pastor he never drink it he never smoked he was just in there he was just born a holy only pastor become a pastor no no no i want the pastor was a sinner doing stuff and they beat the lord and they come standing here with the holy spirit i needed that pastor [Applause] god when you have experience with the bonnie bush he came here he preached connection he will receive the life past tense god look at him he's a holy never seen but the problem will become the bosses we don't want to repent anymore why what the matter of the church today the church where people they can come heavily cry to the lord there is no more all of us we are sent we are in a perfection are you sure are you serious sister this year is going to end right now so i'm giving you a tips sister brother if you're a child of god change your behavior there is no boss you are a duster nothing zero you don't know you mean nothing only god in you can make you something if you have a spirit of controlling make yourself correct let us cross promise god i'm going to repent you'll be surprised i'm going to tell you something i would tell my wife me if i follow a woman she's there i'll tell you if you're going to to divorce me up up to you i will tell you i fall yesterday forgive me i can't keep i don't have a girl in me to keep with no sense of dairy i can follow you for everybody someone here holy spirit can fall it's not about a sin it's about how you repent there is no boss that is the boss of the lord jesus christ and the perfect is the lord jesus christ the one must be in you that's the perfect one the mountain was not too holy when is the holy one coming the mountain and the mountain become holy you are not perfect only the one is perfect i mean you become a perfect we need a perfection from god we don't need your manufacturers whatever christianity we don't need it he cry god you know my heart there is no crime anymore we are the bosses now perfect everything hiding sins that's why there is no healing living in the church there is nothing in the church happening why people don't want to repent and do you know when when you're worried about something like i love the way pastor preached daddy the way god deal is not the way as we think you can deal job was dealing too much my my children hey my children maybe they they can sin they offer the offer always think over and over and over that thought to cross the the three more engines it touched god it would reach the curtain and it was disturbing god and god to deal with that fear of job of his children is to make him to pass that way hallelujah and when the job come out for that way he never worry anymore hallelujah that's why you try and the pain is the glory of god god hear me i'm see your child i still having you know god doesn't delay he said no i still loving you god even you take me to hell i'm still loving you because what i have

[Applause] [Music] let's stand on our feet and worship a little bit and then brother jordan would come let the church said amen [Music] god has spoken let the church see me [Applause] [Music] amen god has spoken me [Music] of christ see the message to the laodicea church age he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church repent quickly and the prophet of god make us to know repentance was in the bribe portion of the messenger message because when the message goes out to every age every two section of the message there is one that is dressed to their general age and then to the elect to the bride in that age the message come here to have an ear let him hear what the spirit says repent quickly lisa come and remove your candlestick so we know that repentance is our potion amen the ability to repent is not what a man can make up it take girls to deal with the heart of a man amen praise the lord and just like paul says you know godly sorrow walketh repentance praise the lord heavenly father we take your word tonight lord and we say oh god turn our hearts around lord that's what repenting is it's an above face lord god is a turn in our hearts in our mind in our decisions lord in our desires turn our hearts around father oh god like david said in the psalm revive my heart lord and oh god that's our prayer tonight lord you will turn our hearts you will give us a spirit lord father of repentance lord o god to turn away from the thanks lord that are now pleasing to you to the things that are pleasing father we pray to god bring repentance to the hearts of our young people oh god we just pray father bring repentance lord to the hearts of god father of our older people bring repentance to the hearts of our husbands lord to the host house of our wives who god to the house of the preachers of god oh god just like daniel laying himself before the altar confessing his sin and the sins of the people oh father god we all need it lord we just want to thank you tonight father god for your word oh god in the way that father you are speaking to us the way you are dealing with our hearts we just love you now in jesus name we pray amen burn burn holy spirit burning me amen brother jordan will come greet us tonight praise the lord amen you know the brothers did not ask me to make brother jordan the last i choose to make him the last and i never told him i was making him the last maybe brother dan heard it and then that's why he asked for better jordan time and the other person take brother jordan time and but so brother jordan i give you my time [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] fill me with [Applause] [Music] down is [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you musicians once again you guys are doing a great job this evening thank you so much let's give them a handcuff here you know it's always good to remember all the support pieces that come in that you wouldn't you don't realize how much they actually mean to the body until they're gone but how much they actually add these are people who have they're actually a part of the ministry and they come and they prepare their hearts and they set their time aside even before they get into service and they have already put so much into the service before they ever get here so that they can minister all to all of us and i i just want to appreciate that um real quick we're gonna jump right in i know brother one gave me his time but i'll try not to take all of it um i was figuring i was down to about five minutes and so uh just real quickly we'll go to revelations chapter eight and verse one i've just got one verse here and we'll jump in and you know my dad if there were those you don't know my dad is a minister as well and he'll always tell me he said well i'm ready i got my bombs ready we're just going to go in and drop them and so when he drops them it's about three hours worth of tonight we're just going to kind of do the old world war ii or dive bomb right in let it go and jump right out all right say amen if you got the scripture there all right let's read it together here and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour let's pray heavenly father lord we just come before you once again this evening just so thankful to be here in your presence father lord in the midst of your people father lord we can be so positive that your presence is here because i look out and i see your people gathered father and you said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be also father and so lord all i can assume is that as i look out and see all your people here father that there's an innumerable host gathered with us but not just an innumerable host of angels but you yourself are standing here beside us father lord it's not just a thing of the time of the prophets of old or the time of the prophet of our age father but lord we believe you still come on the scene and stand here right at the pulpit father and it's not the the man standing behind the pulpit for father if that's true then we might as well just all leave but it's you anointing the man to speak father in your truth pouring forth to the heart of the believer and also you there and the soul in the heart of believer anointing that word to the heart to meet that need father and stir up faith we just thank you for that we give you all honor glory and praise in jesus name amen you may be seated you know i've actually had this on my heart and on my mind for quite some time i'm watching my time and i'm down to two minutes i think but brother one had actually asked me to minister quite some time ago and i'm one of those ministers and i think i actually that's probably most ministers is you sit in a congregation and you listen to other ministers preach and you write down notes and most people i don't know but i would assume right down notes are actually more or less direct quotations and i think a lot of times ministers when they write down notes they're writing down what it was that it made them think of and so if you went back and read their notes from that service you would have no clue what the service was about but you know that's kind of how i do and then whenever you know the lord puts it on the heart of a minister or brother one or whoever i'm at to ask me to speak i pull from those things and there'll just be things that the lord will be working on my heart and this whole half hour of silence and the setting around the seventh seal and i know there's a lot of debate in and amongst the message on the seal is open is it closed and we're not going to jump into that and but there's a lot of things that trouble me about it and about the half hour of silence and you know people talking we don't know what's going on there and and whatnot but i would like to take a little title and i wasn't sure which one to title it but i have the seventh seal mystery of your life or the believer's half hour of silence with the lord now as you if you've been in the message a while or you've studied and you've got into it you realize brother adam talks about the seals he says if you would go back to genesis you can find the seals in the book of genesis right and so if you jump back to the book of genesis and i'm going to go real fast here so just stay with me you'll find out the the parallel that you find is the days of creation where you have day one day two day three day four day five day six and then day seven right and two things that you'll find running in that parallel along with both the seals and those those six days and whatnot is you'll find out that in those first six days there's a whole lot of detail that god puts in there he tells you what he's doing and how he's doing it and where he's going and what he's doing and what the results of that is but you know everything about those six days has to do with what he's doing with this earth and the earthly things and how that's being affected by him moving up upon the water upon the land upon the plant life upon all of these things and if you go through the seals and you read about the seals or you read through the scripture of the seals or even brother random bringing the seals force he says most of the seals he said it's all history you see it's all things gone by and the the seal that we have left is gonna be tell us what's gonna what's to come we know like the sixth seal it's unfolding now we're in the midst of it the fifth seal it's unfolding now there's things coming to pass now but they all have to do with tribulation with judgment on this world things that god has laid out and said these are the things to be watching for he even pointed out his timepiece israel you see because all these seals and even within the church ages he laid out things that he wasn't worried about the devil knowing but he wanted to give his people things to be watching for to know where they were at in the timeline you see but when he got to the seventh seal silence in heaven no one knew what was going on no one knew nothing brother adam says when jesus preached the the the church ages or the seals there back in the book believe the book of matthew he says he goes all the way through to six and then when he gets to what should be the seventh he breaks into parables no details and the reason why is the same reason why on the seventh day it just said and god rested is because that seventh day was about god and adam walking together towards adoption towards that perfection that he was to come to and so is the seventh seal has nothing to do with this world has nothing to do with the goings-on right now has nothing to do with coronavirus and has nothing to do with world wars has nothing to do with conflicts it has to do with one thing god and his bride okay so now we we have a concept and we can see how god's working and what he's doing right now we can apply that to our own lives all through scripture we have examples what you should do what you shouldn't do we have examples of the the of what you sow you will reap and these are all true things for everyone what about the believer no one in this room if you look back your life is reaping for the things some of the things you have sowed because you never did it in the first place so how can he attribute a growth or a crop to the sowing of a seed that never happened amen and so all of that get transitioned back on the one responsible for it the devil you see but one thing i want us to focus in on in this half hour of silence you know everyone would like to take and and go through the scripture and point out the do's and the don'ts the commandments there's the the beatitudes there's all these things right and then start looking at each especially everyone else's life we don't want to apply it to our own that gets too frightening um but we want to look and especially when about the time we get to church we've been here a few days a few years you know we're feeling pretty good and then we see someone else come in and we go uh-huh i know everything there is to know about you and what you sow you'll reap so just watch it it's coming it's coming and we like jonah we're like jonah we've gone to nineveh we've seen the sin of the city and now we're just waiting for judgment to strike and then we do the same thing too we get upset with god lord what about this one here i know what they did where's the judgment where's the judgment and then god will do like he did with jonah and he'll let some little thing that you thought was the greatest blessing in your life get taken out from you so you so he can he can show you it's not about you it's always been about me always that was the case with jonah and nineveh god told him it's not about those people it's not about you but me it's about me i created all those people and i would not have them destroyed that's by my choice how dare you cast judgment you're the one who ran in the opposite direction i knew you would run so i picked you for my purpose and it's always been for my purpose but you know we we the believer's life is encapsulated in that half hour of silence each one of us from birth and the half hour of silence encapsulates our life away from the devil you see the devil is doing the exact same thing because like the ministers have already mentioned tonight he knows this bible he knows the message he knows who jesus is he knows who the prophet is and he knows it backwards and forwards that's why he comes to you he says i know what you did and i know the scripture and per the scripture there's no way you are a son or daughter of god you might as well give up now enjoy what you can i have it to give you you see because he's doing the same thing that he's done through the saints through all the ages when he saw abraham he didn't see a great man of faith he saw a man that was tempted away and and was ready to give up his his very own wife and walk away when he when he saw jacob he didn't see a great man of faith he didn't see someone who was a prince with god when he saw david he didn't see him as as a man after god's own heart he saw david's failings and he said david should be stoned per god's own law he should be stoned you know and when he saw moses you know moses was was an active enslaver of his own people until he caught a revelation of what was going on he saw paul and he saw paul and he tried to chase paul down forever with something that god actually used to keep paul humble it was all a part of god's purpose and you know it's even like where am i at i think i'm really burning time now is that through it all and and one other thing i wrote down here is we're we are god's agents and what i mean by that is you know there's spy agencies and and special forces groups across the world for all different countries and it's easy there's plenty of videos out there and and even movies made about them and and you can find training manuals on how they do certain things but the details about their mission are super secret they're classified in fact those missions are usually never declassified until those people even have passed away and gone off the scene and even then sometimes some things that they have done never come to light and so it is with god's people by the time the devil knows who they are their mission is done and they've left the scene you know the prophet said if the devil knew what taking christ to calvary would do he would have never let him go but by the time it had happened it was too late and so it is with each one of us we we have our failings in the flesh but it has nothing to do with the seed deep inside or with god's mission for you is in this life to the rest of us maybe even to those who are close to you they're looking they're going oh my goodness wow you're you're so out of god's will it's about time you come home to the flock and and it's true there is a time that god will bring you around but there's never been a time when you've been out of god's will for your life but what he knew what you were going to do the choice you were going to make and he put you in that position for a purpose now me and you and the devil may not know what that purpose is until we've crossed into the other side in fact me and you will know the devil may never know he may be mystified until the day he's going to judgment and still not know because guess what when we go to judgment the bride isn't the one being judged she's the one handing out judgments and so our our you know brother ram talks about the great white throne judgment he said on that day as judgment is being played out the lies of those who are coming for the white great throne that their life will be played before a giant audience and everyone will see and everyone will know but not you and me the devil will be mystified until the until the last second as he's being dropped into that lake of fire to be consumed because it's classified so don't get down don't you worry god is in control let me just read you one thing here and just tie it together just let take it home think about these things take it back to the scripture think about it god to every single scripture to everything he says there's there's not just one purpose there's not just one meaning but god that's why brother branham said you can take one verse from the scripture he said you could stay on it for the rest of your life he said as god was to reveal it and open it it says it's without end you know we we think we can read one scripture we read a quote and we someone preaches on it and we think oh that's all there is to it and then we hunker down on that thing don't do that take the approach brother branham said he said he said this is what we know for right now and i'm rejoicing in it now but i'm just waiting for that next thing he's going to reveal to me that's what god wants to do with your life too so think about it when you read the seals and i know the the people have made it quite mysterious and and hard to understand and stuff don't don't worry about that stuff it's there for a purpose i'm not saying the mysteries are nothing the mysteries are something but it's not meant to be mysterious it's meant to be revealed to you personally a personal revelation between you and god that's where it is in that secret hidden place in that that moment of silence it's not a silence to you it's a silence to everyone else as god reveals himself to you so get into that secret place that's what billy brown said that third pool was all about he said that little tent vision was he said i was on the outside and the people would go in with the and the angel lord was in the tent with them that angel lord that you should stand by him it was in the tent they would enter in have a personal experience and they would come out and they would ask him what happened they would say i don't know you just have to be there and that's how it is for each and every one of our lives you enter into that place that quiet place with him that closet place every single day of every single moment of your life as he's revealing himself to you it's not silent to you it's a reality it's a silent to the devil and everyone else who's watching and it's meant to be that way because it's not their revelation it's yours personally and so don't let things be mysterious but read them if you don't understand it lord reveal this to me how does it apply to my life don't just take it as a moment in time or a nice story or oh wow that's super mysterious no no no if it's there it's there's something there for you and in the seventh seal i'm going really fast it was in paragraph 394 and just a portion of it it says no we find that christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened that seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it but it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about the seven thunder mystery so you see it's connected together you see you personally but random said when you receive the holy ghost no one else knows you yourself you marked that spot now as life goes on people will know if you received it but no one can no one but you can mark the point and drive an anchor down and say this is where this is where it happened and that's where it is he's coming to meet you there he's coming to meet you there and no one knows about it no one knew that's why he said it would be like a a thief in the night you just have to be ready he's not going to give you a certain date so that you can you know a lot of us like to procrastinate you're talking brother you were talking about studying and i i know all about it and and my thing is is especially when i'm really dreading something we procrastinate which we set it to the side we're like ah okay i got two more days okay i think i can i can do this little thing over here and this little thing over here and and i still got enough time i'll be okay and come down down to the last minute you're like oh no i have this test and i haven't studied it's not that you didn't have the time it's just there's something about human natures we anything that we're uncomfortable with or we're we're kind of nervous about we we tend to put off and put off and put off because we don't have to face it but god doesn't give you a specific time and date he just says be ready be ready because i'm coming i'm not you're not going to know when and no one else is going to know when but when i come knocking be ready to open the door don't be sleeping don't be sleeping i'm coming so saints we're in that half hour of silence not just as a bride but personally and it's an exciting time because it's the bride and groom getting to know each other like never before because saints we're not going to the marriage of the lamb we're going to the marriage supper of the lamb and we're in the marriage time now so if you're not entering into that time of the marriage with the lamb then you're missing out enter into that little tent that little closet and let that be just slip away just you and him god bless you saints [Applause] amen i praise the lord [Music] worship his name listing closely yay [Music] never be [Music] is [Music] is [Music] bobby [Music] i was listening to a very prominent teacher he's a very good bible teacher he's a scholar he knows the ju the hebrew and i was listening to him teaching on the sequence of time and he was talking about at the white throne judgment and after the judgment and we would get our reward and he said he said and and i believe it's right in that time the bride will be called i said oh my goodness i said oh my goodness because he was actually teaching and what he was trying to place in scripture was the willing supper so in his understanding the bride will be caught right after the sheep and the goat judgment and then there will be a wedding supper but you see the thing about it there is that there cannot be a wedding without the bridegroom there cannot be a wedding without the bride now if you have the bride and the bridegroom still there cannot be a wedding if you don't have the wedding officer there is someone that's supposed to perform the wedding and waiting without a wedding officer is when people live as common law husband and wife a man and a woman that joined themselves together without the pronouncing from the wedding officer you are just common lord husband and wife there must be somebody that that that has been licensed by the state or licensed you know commissioned by the word to perform the marriage so if there is a marriage of the lamb there have to be a wedding officer that perform the marriage of the lamb praise the lord and until you are in the marriage of the lamb you cannot be in a wedding supper it's a kind of a different difference we find time and you know we just don't have time to talk about it but we want to just appreciate the lord tonight speaking about us you know running the race with patient and uh uh brother jordan manny come and talking about uh preparation getting yourself ready and then brother uh brother joe mushuta comes and tells teach about what makes it difficult to leave christian live in and you know bringing us to the place of repentance preparing ourselves and then brother jordan comes with a half hour of silence praise the lord we just we want to be thankful we want to be thankful all i can say to you tonight that he that have an ear we hear what the spirit said praise the lord is now what the brother said is what the spirit said that's what you must be listening for praise the lord amen and i hope that the spirit says something to you tonight that was encouraging amen praise the lord the lord bless you you may just have your seat i want to read a vision to you just before we go into praying [Music] it's from the message paradox i want to share this vision with you and we will read that and just take ourselves into pray as we welcome the coming year i have mentioned it once and i was going out and i was going to cut it off the tape but i believe i would just leave it it was about three or three o'clock in the morning i suppose they got him up and i look were in front of me and i was coming down to jordan looked like i was standing on the map of palestine and i and i was coming down to the jordan and it seems like i could hear a song i'm going down to the jordan someone was singing it and as i drew near the river i look back and it and seems which away i had come and i was too tired of the way there to jordan and i look across jordan and i said oh praise god just on the other side is where all the promises lay on the other side praise the lord is where all the promises laid every promise laying in the promised land and we know that the promised land for the believers is uh is is the is the promise is the is the holy ghost amen praise the lord the holy ghost is the promise this promise is unto you and and to your children and to many as the lord our god shall call is a promise but when that promise possess your body then it becomes the promised land amen because that promise must be fulfilled somewhere israel was given a natural land we are giving a spiritual land to be able to enjoy the promises of god in this body praise the lord so right across there lays the promised land and then i came to myself and i thought kuwaiti who are possibly who it have been i was dreaming or was it uh of course it was nighttime see a vision is something that you you see with your eyes open just like a drain but this time your eyes are stopping and then as and then as i said there a little bit beside the chair and all for all of a sudden yeah come here it comes back again then i knew then that it was a vision i knew then that it was a vision and then when i when i come into the vision again it seems that i was lifted up sitting a highway a narrow highway with some brother i never knew who the brother was i look around now i'm sure and i know this is a vision the lord god is here and seems like everybody was afraid everybody so afraid of and a voice came and said there is such danger in these days there is a great heavier stains there's death when it strikes you [Music] and i heard the weed mashing down in a log and here come a huge muscle snake crawling through the weeds i thought now ignoring this is a vision then i said then then i shall see knowing this is a vision i shall see what this animal all this beast is now he's he's trying to give us biblical symbol this animal representing a beast a beast is a power in the bible and he crawl up on the highway and as soon as i i got a sight of him i knew it was a mamba now a mamba is an african snake which is which is the most daily bite of all things there is there is nothing as person as person as a mamba and the snake of course represents sin the snake represents sin the snake represents death [Music] but this in nature represent power so a power of sin and death that is approaching something dangerous we're living in dangerous time [Music] and year he was on the highway i taught so i looked at him and he looked angry at me and and he like his tongue and here he comes and and when he got right close he run up fast and then he would get closer and closer [Music] and just wave out and stop and then something will haul him off he couldn't bite me and he did turn around to the other side and try to approach this side and he did get back and get a stat right towards me and get slower and slower and slower and then he will stop and then just shake like that and move back he could instruct me now brother brandon watching this video vision just like looking at a movie praise the lord just like watching the movie then he and he's seeing this big deal snake you know coming closer to him and and then for off of a sudden it would just stop and then it would go back and uh it would try to find another way again and start creeping on him a little bit and as he come closer it would just stop and it would go back he's watching this thing in a vision praise the lord [Music] then he turned and looked at my friend and the way he went after my friend and i seen my friend just jumping way in the air over him and over him and over him trying and i think was tracking at him i thought oh if it ever hits him it's it will be instant death no wonder everybody is so scared because when this thing hits you is an instant death and it was and it was just striking at him like that and i threw my hands up i said oh god have mercy on my brother [Music] i said if that serpent ever struck him it would kill him and just then the serpent turned to me when i said that and look at me again and the voice came from above and said you have been given power to bound him praise the lord the word sin inning and i said well god what must i do he said there is one thing you must do you must be more sincere you have been given power but to use their power you must be more sincere [Music] you must be more sincere and i say well god forgive me for my own sincerity [Music] and let me have sincerity and when i raise up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was charged with something praise the lord [Music] and i look at the serpent and then he and then he started to wash me and he couldn't do it yet and i said satan in the name of the lord jesus christ i bound you [Music] and a serpent a blue smoke flew out of him and he crawled up and made a sign of an s capital s made backwards just like the sound of an end conjunction which means bound this one all anything below him praise the lord now so he goes on and he narrates the vision we're getting close to our time here of praying but just to realize he's having a vision of crossing over into the promised land of guarding over and yeri's head the vision repeats with a second a power a beast that is trying to stop him from getting over into the promised land now out of this vision comes with the changing of the ministry this was about going into the territory the full promise of the word you know when and just to cop a little bit with some of the things that the brother said [Music] if you if you read all the supernatural things that happen right around the opening of the seals heavyweight boys receiving their salvation but brandon says in half an hour those boys were down crying the resurrection of the little fish in half an hour he says when i say little fish i give you back your life he said in half an hour the little fish started wiggling the tails and it was gone speaking of the scars they all come in in half an hour [Music] we know we have a spiritual promise [Music] and yeah he said that we about to cross from one year into another [Music] in no way can that be compared to our spiritual promise but you think about it now if we would get power to be able to bring our body in subjection to the word of god if there is something that you struggling with in your life maybe it's temper maybe it's a habit for you to be able to have power over that daily thing that is always making you miserable always making you to regret there is one thing the word of god required of us is to be more sincere is god that with sincerity praise the lord amen he have the skill that with sincerity is now what you think it's not what i think if we will ever get on the other side if this coming year will be the year where we will have victory over lust praise the lord if this is the year where we will have victory over the things that the enemy is using to create condemnation to make us discouraged there is one thing we can yield ourselves to [Music] god make me more sincere praise the lord now you have to remember that before brother branham first commissioned the angel of the lord told him if you will be sincere [Music] there's nothing we stand before your prayer and now this is just before growing into the fullness of the ministry year is here again god is requiring more sincerity praise the lord as a church if there is one thing that i want from god for this church is for us to be sincere if god will just deal with our hearts and make us sincere [Music] sincere to the word not coming for showmanship [Music] not coming to please somebody but because we want more of him in our life praise the lord can you join me tonight and ask the lord god make me more sincere because you are the one that sets the rings in the heart if i would have power to preach if i would have strained let's buy our hands

how you met us we are striving for the lord to be able to help us praise the lord but i also want to say as as the pastor of the church i'm very grateful and i'm very proud to be able to have the the the privilege to be able to do the commencement service of two of the saints that has come to this church you know there is something when you know that a brother or the sister is struggling and they are in and out and and their different things are happening in their life and and then it's more heartbreaking again if they are not serious about the things of god they just laugh they just calm you know they just joke about it sometimes when it comes down to their death it becomes a difficult message to preach i rather just preach to the living and then forget about that person because i will not want to bear fall witness but it's also a peaceful thing when you know what a man or a woman is standing with god when you know the life that they have left so just like how i counted the privilege to dedicate the many babies that we have dedicated a few not many we're looking for more and also to be able to do a few weddings that i've had the privilege to do i also very grateful to be able to do the home going of our dear brother's cat and sister mimi praise the lord someone asked me how i feel and i told them i feel very good [Music] i feel very good because those are people that
