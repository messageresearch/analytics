[58:02] sister brother wesley and sister carol
[58:05] sent a testimony
[58:07] and i was not able to pick that up on
[58:09] sunday and i was hoping that i would not
[58:11] forget tonight
[58:12] but sister carrot is feeling much better
[58:14] and she wanted to thank you
[58:16] for your prayers amen amen i wanted to
[58:19] make sure
[58:20] that i don't forget about that while we
[58:22] were praying it came to my mind again i
[58:24] said oh god you got to help me
[58:26] this mind it seems to be it's not
[58:28] keeping things these days
[58:30] praise the lord i want to talk on
[58:33] something
[58:34] trusting that the lord will be able to
[58:36] bless it and make it a blessing to you
[58:38] tonight
[58:39] but uh you know brother branham talk uh
[58:43] made a statement he says the way god did
[58:46] with abraham
[58:47] that's the way he deals with abraham c
[58:51] and and when we look in the in the life
[58:55] of
[58:55] abraham we realized there were principal
[58:58] things
[58:59] that god planted send god work
[59:03] by sea principle there were principle
[59:06] things
[59:07] that he planted in the life of abraham
[59:11] praise the lord and
[59:13] [Music]
[59:15] we we trust in that the law will be able
[59:18] to help us tonight like i said
[59:24] we want to we want to see it and realize
[59:26] that abraham is the father of faith
[59:30] not only that he's the father of faith
[59:34] but also he is the genesis
[59:38] he's he's the one that god was beginning
[59:41] you know an unconditional coveting
[59:45] god was beginning an unconditional
[59:47] coveting
[59:48] with abraham and a a
[59:52] a confident that he will that he will
[59:54] also relate with the rest of the world
[59:57] he will relate with the rest of abraham
[59:59] seed he will relate with the rest of the
[1:00:01] redeemed
[1:00:02] around the world praise the lord so
[1:00:06] uh when you look in the scripture and
[1:00:08] there were major things that brother
[1:00:10] branham pointed out
[1:00:12] you know in the life of abraham but
[1:00:14] there there are other things
[1:00:15] also that are lying right in the
[1:00:17] scripture and when you look in the
[1:00:19] message
[1:00:20] you know uh you read and and and and god
[1:00:24] uh by grace uh will help us to be able
[1:00:27] to see one of their tonight
[1:00:29] and and what i want to look at tonight
[1:00:32] is i want to look at abraham
[1:00:36] a friend of god i want to look at a
[1:00:39] relationship of
[1:00:40] friendship that god has with abraham
[1:00:46] because this relationship of friendship
[1:00:49] will be the center
[1:00:53] relationship is not the highest form of
[1:00:56] relationship
[1:00:57] but it's it's a central relationship
[1:01:00] that ties every other relationship
[1:01:04] as we go along you'll be able to
[1:01:05] honestly grab my thought
[1:01:07] i'm you know i'm i don't have enough
[1:01:10] words to really be able to express
[1:01:12] myself so i have to repeat myself a few
[1:01:14] times
[1:01:15] praise the lord but friendship is a
[1:01:18] it's a it's a kind of a relationship one
[1:01:21] of
[1:01:21] the many relationships that we have in
[1:01:23] this life
[1:01:25] but it's a very very very important
[1:01:28] relationship
[1:01:30] praise the lord amen
[1:01:33] from the word and the in the message of
[1:01:35] the hour we know that the marriage
[1:01:37] relationship
[1:01:38] is the highest form of relationship
[1:01:42] is the highest form of relationship
[1:01:45] amen that that we will
[1:01:48] we will enter into our experience or you
[1:01:53] know another there
[1:01:54] and our first our first form of
[1:01:56] relationship
[1:01:57] is is the relationship by birth that
[1:02:00] make us children
[1:02:01] sons and daughters so we relate to our
[1:02:04] parents as children children
[1:02:06] parents relate to us you know as parents
[1:02:09] and
[1:02:11] that's our first form of relationship
[1:02:14] but the friendship relationship is very
[1:02:16] important
[1:02:17] very very important we don't have enough
[1:02:20] time tonight so i will try to speed up a
[1:02:22] little bit
[1:02:26] and it's is this is this relationship
[1:02:29] that uh uh if
[1:02:34] the law don't help us to achieve it
[1:02:39] it brings unsettlement in the rest of
[1:02:43] your relationships
[1:02:48] i don't care whether it is parent to
[1:02:51] children children to parent
[1:02:52] husband to wife wife to husband
[1:02:56] uh working relationship
[1:02:59] relationship in church
[1:03:03] if if the
[1:03:06] the the relationship of friendship
[1:03:10] is not birth it will
[1:03:13] unbalance the rest of your relationship
[1:03:17] friendship is so important
[1:03:21] is is such a relationship that is so
[1:03:23] important
[1:03:25] that uh
[1:03:29] it looks like the center of all
[1:03:32] relationship
[1:03:35] praise the lord
[1:03:38] amen just now as we were reading here
[1:03:42] the bible says and god
[1:03:44] said i know him talking about abraham
[1:03:47] i know him
[1:03:51] i know him when you say you know
[1:03:53] somebody
[1:03:55] it's not just their name
[1:04:01] amen it's not just their name or their
[1:04:04] address
[1:04:07] you know them
[1:04:10] by nature we will look into that a
[1:04:12] little bit i pray the lord will help us
[1:04:14] tonight amen
[1:04:16] praise the lord if you're praying for me
[1:04:18] thank you for your prayers
[1:04:21] and uh so
[1:04:24] it's it's it's a it's a very serious
[1:04:27] relationship
[1:04:28] now you will realize that in adam
[1:04:32] when the scripture talks about adam and
[1:04:34] the scripture talks about the
[1:04:35] relationship that god had with adam
[1:04:37] and eve brother branham talks about the
[1:04:39] relationship that god had with adam
[1:04:42] and one of the plays that brother
[1:04:43] branham plays god's relationship with
[1:04:46] adam
[1:04:47] is is is an adopted son so
[1:04:50] adam's relationship with god was more of
[1:04:53] a son
[1:04:54] and father because every time brother
[1:04:57] branham is talking about adoption
[1:04:59] he goes back to adam how adam was placed
[1:05:02] in the garden of eden and he had
[1:05:03] authority over days
[1:05:05] he had authority over that but you also
[1:05:08] realize that
[1:05:09] i have never had a friendship
[1:05:11] relationship with god that was what he
[1:05:12] was running
[1:05:14] he was hiding you don't hide from your
[1:05:17] friend
[1:05:20] he was a son
[1:05:24] amen there are many sons that don't have
[1:05:26] relationship with their i mean
[1:05:28] friendship
[1:05:28] with their father they have relationship
[1:05:32] as sons
[1:05:34] but they don't have relationship as
[1:05:36] friends
[1:05:40] do you see where we're going tonight are
[1:05:42] you ready
[1:05:45] take your seat belt amen
[1:05:50] praise the lord
[1:05:54] so adam adam was a son made in the image
[1:05:58] of god
[1:05:59] and and and he was an amateur god he
[1:06:02] could speak
[1:06:03] to the to the to the to the
[1:06:07] the animals you know uh i mean he
[1:06:10] he was he just had control over the
[1:06:12] earth
[1:06:14] amen he had control god would come down
[1:06:18] in the evening and have fellowship with
[1:06:20] adam
[1:06:21] and and i believe that god was building
[1:06:24] because that's how friendship
[1:06:26] is built friendship is built by
[1:06:28] fellowship so
[1:06:29] god will come down in the evening and
[1:06:31] have fellowship with adam
[1:06:33] trying to build that friendship
[1:06:37] trying to build that closeness
[1:06:43] are we together amen
[1:06:46] so you will realize that it never taught
[1:06:50] abraham an overnight experience for him
[1:06:52] to be a friend of god
[1:06:55] it never took him an overnight
[1:06:58] experience
[1:07:00] amen this was a man that waited on on
[1:07:02] the promise of god for 25 years
[1:07:07] he never taught him just you know
[1:07:10] just by god speaking to him and leave
[1:07:12] your father house and leave your mother
[1:07:14] house and
[1:07:15] and leave your kindred and i'll make you
[1:07:17] father of nation for him to become a
[1:07:19] friend of god no
[1:07:23] it took the trial it took the test
[1:07:29] because it takes trial and test for you
[1:07:32] to build
[1:07:32] trust and that's one of the principal
[1:07:37] element of friendship
[1:07:38] is trust
[1:07:46] praise the lord amen
[1:07:49] it's a principle element
[1:07:52] of friendship trust
[1:08:00] so we see here through the scripture
[1:08:06] genesis 12 god spoke to abraham what
[1:08:09] about vision
[1:08:10] dreams one of those things and
[1:08:13] uh and abraham was looking for the land
[1:08:17] who makeup and builder was god
[1:08:20] he just fell in his heart he was he was
[1:08:22] so convinced
[1:08:24] right away he just thought that he was
[1:08:26] going to find his place in and he was
[1:08:28] going to have a child with his wife
[1:08:30] and if he was going to be the father of
[1:08:32] nation he was thinking about having i
[1:08:34] mean
[1:08:34] maybe maybe 25 children
[1:08:39] he had it all plain in his mind how he
[1:08:41] was going to
[1:08:42] to to to populate the earth
[1:08:47] praise the lord not knowing that god was
[1:08:50] speaking about
[1:08:52] uh uh it was it was it was uh it was a
[1:08:54] spiritual promise
[1:08:57] now but as as you watch abraham live
[1:09:00] you see that uh he traveled
[1:09:04] on in and he was with his his uh his uh
[1:09:08] cursing nephew lot and we know all the
[1:09:10] story
[1:09:11] but abraham went from one trial to
[1:09:13] another for the matter of fact if you
[1:09:15] read from genesis 12
[1:09:17] you realize that god has seven major
[1:09:21] appearance to abraham
[1:09:27] seven major the seventh one was when
[1:09:30] elohim himself came down
[1:09:33] but he has several major uh uh uh
[1:09:37] uh appearance uh he dared with abraham
[1:09:40] differently brother branham says
[1:09:42] i've heard ye uh now i see it he says
[1:09:44] god there with abraham different with
[1:09:47] visions
[1:09:47] there were times he dealt with abraham
[1:09:49] by visions
[1:09:50] i mean different way he did with abraham
[1:09:53] so we we see
[1:09:54] that and all of that but what i'm trying
[1:09:57] to say there is that all of these
[1:09:59] different dealings
[1:10:00] it was god's way of
[1:10:04] bringing abraham to that place of
[1:10:06] friendship
[1:10:09] praise the lord now because you have to
[1:10:12] remember now
[1:10:13] abraham is the father of faith
[1:10:16] abraham god is using him
[1:10:20] as a foundation stone to be able
[1:10:23] to start a coveting an unconditional
[1:10:28] coveted
[1:10:32] and the person that you will have an
[1:10:33] unconditional covenant with
[1:10:35] is not just anybody that you meet on the
[1:10:37] street
[1:10:42] it has to be somebody that you know
[1:10:48] and god says i know him
[1:10:54] they are different different characters
[1:10:55] through the bible like even
[1:10:57] job you see job and god there with job
[1:11:00] in a level
[1:11:01] and and and and and there is there is
[1:11:03] there is uh
[1:11:04] there is a relationship that god built
[1:11:07] with job
[1:11:08] you know just and just like i said uh
[1:11:10] that about adam
[1:11:12] and but in abraham god was able
[1:11:17] to establish such a relationship
[1:11:23] think about it after waiting 25 years
[1:11:27] he told abraham give me the ball back
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:37] and abraham being afraid he never wraps
[1:11:40] up with god
[1:11:44] are we together he never rises up with
[1:11:47] god he never
[1:11:48] he never argued with god and uh uh
[1:11:51] and he never even told his wife
[1:11:57] he never told her the details
[1:12:00] he told her they were going to sacrifice
[1:12:03] but he never told her the details
[1:12:09] praise the lord that just goes to show
[1:12:12] you some of the things that friends do
[1:12:17] some of the things that friends do
[1:12:23] so we see here let's let's let's
[1:12:27] look at this but
[1:12:34] through the scripture
[1:12:37] like the bible says the the the
[1:12:40] scripture
[1:12:41] was written by inspiration
[1:12:44] amen and made through the scripture
[1:12:50] as the holy ghost was building
[1:12:53] this picture and the picture started
[1:12:56] becoming
[1:12:57] you know developing and becoming clear
[1:13:02] there were men in the scripture that
[1:13:04] were able to
[1:13:05] see maybe
[1:13:09] maybe abraham in himself
[1:13:12] never really came to that place to have
[1:13:15] saw or to the relationship that he had
[1:13:19] with god
[1:13:22] praise the lord just like joseph never
[1:13:26] knew he was a type of christ
[1:13:29] abraham never knew they are taking isaac
[1:13:31] on top of the mountain it was going to
[1:13:33] be a type of christ
[1:13:36] he was just living his life obeying god
[1:13:41] keeping keeping secret with his friend
[1:13:46] praise the lord are we together
[1:13:50] he loved the lord tonight amen
[1:13:59] second chronicles chapter 20
[1:14:03] joshua stood
[1:14:06] in the congregation of judah in
[1:14:09] jerusalem in the house of the lord
[1:14:11] that from verse 5. before the new court
[1:14:16] and he said oh lord god of our fathers
[1:14:20] thou annette
[1:14:23] and now thou god in heaven
[1:14:26] and ruleth their net over all the
[1:14:29] kingdoms of the hiddens
[1:14:31] and in their hand
[1:14:34] is there not power and might so that
[1:14:37] none is able to withstand thee
[1:14:41] and not there our god
[1:14:44] who did drive out the inhabitants of
[1:14:47] this land
[1:14:48] before thy people israel and gave
[1:14:51] it to the seed of abraham
[1:14:55] thy frame
[1:14:59] praise the lord
[1:15:03] so it's almost like you pick up a book
[1:15:09] and you are reading a story about
[1:15:12] uh about abraham lincoln or any great
[1:15:15] man
[1:15:16] and as you read the story it's not it's
[1:15:19] not
[1:15:19] clearly seen but you could see the
[1:15:22] relationship
[1:15:24] so when they read about abraham the
[1:15:28] the way they saw god dealing with
[1:15:30] abraham
[1:15:32] god intervening
[1:15:36] praise the lord
[1:15:39] when nabimi like talked abraham's wife
[1:15:44] god intervened and said you are dead
[1:15:47] don't do this
[1:15:48] i know the integrity of your heart
[1:15:51] but that man is my seventh
[1:15:55] and even go to him let him pray for you
[1:15:57] so seeing the way that god
[1:16:00] dared with abraham
[1:16:04] this man of inspiration started to
[1:16:07] to put together the picture they could
[1:16:09] see the friendship
[1:16:15] praise the lord
[1:16:19] god said i know him is there anything i
[1:16:22] can hide from him
[1:16:23] you don't hide him from your friend
[1:16:29] is there anything i can hide from
[1:16:31] abraham i
[1:16:32] know this man i can tell him my secrets
[1:16:36] why because he will even teach his
[1:16:39] children
[1:16:40] he will pass it down
[1:16:46] are we together praise the lord
[1:16:50] brother branham said this in the message
[1:16:54] lifting up
[1:16:55] letting him out of history
[1:16:59] he said there's there's another thing
[1:17:02] that i would like to say
[1:17:04] that is another thing running out
[1:17:08] running out is friendship friendship is
[1:17:11] running out

[1:17:17] have the friends
[1:17:21] that we used to have
[1:17:24] praise the lord
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:34] it's funny but it's sad that facebook

[1:18:05] where people
[1:18:08] can't even trust themselves
[1:18:12] people are so scared
[1:18:19] are we together it doesn't seems
[1:18:23] like that we have friends that we used
[1:18:25] to have
[1:18:27] and and the friends that we
[1:18:30] have are not lawyer friends
[1:18:35] like it used to be
[1:18:40] praise the lord amen
[1:18:43] everybody goes into friendship with
[1:18:47] selfish desire they want to be the one
[1:18:49] pleased in the friendship
[1:18:53] they want to be pleased they don't want
[1:18:55] their feelings to be heard
[1:18:59] amen they want to be pleased
[1:19:03] that's the kind of friends that we have
[1:19:05] friendship right on the edge

[1:19:32] you don't have those lawyer friends like
[1:19:34] it used to be amen
[1:19:37] praise the lord is this is the you know
[1:19:39] this is the code where he says
[1:19:41] you know uh the the the neighbor passed
[1:19:43] away and then you hear
[1:19:44] by in the newspaper praise the lord you
[1:19:48] say because you know
[1:19:51] neighbors are not friends
[1:19:55] praise the lord
[1:19:59] friendship is very serious
[1:20:02] it's a serious uh relationship
[1:20:06] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:20:09] almighty god
[1:20:11] how to take on cystine element he had to
[1:20:14] be born
[1:20:17] was to be a friend
[1:20:21] was to be a friend a friend is a one
[1:20:25] that is touched by the feelings
[1:20:29] of our infirmities
[1:20:36] praise the lord it's a
[1:20:39] very serious relationship
[1:20:46] that it took god to leave his throne
[1:20:51] to become one of us
[1:20:55] as us our creator he's already our
[1:20:58] father
[1:21:00] he made everything he gave life to us
[1:21:04] if just it's just father and and
[1:21:07] children relationship was enough
[1:21:10] he wouldn't have come and become man
[1:21:13] he was already our father
[1:21:17] he was our maker
[1:21:26] praise the lord are we together
[1:21:31] amen amen amen
[1:21:37] glory be to god
[1:21:44] when i get you into this time of dare
[1:21:47] silence then i know i get a hold of your
[1:21:49] spirit
[1:21:53] and i know now that i get a hold of your
[1:21:55] spirit
[1:22:00] i can drive the sword of this world
[1:22:02] right between the dividing asunder
[1:22:06] of your spirit and soul and you will see
[1:22:10] you will sit right there and you won't
[1:22:12] say anything because i know i get you
[1:22:19] praise the lord
[1:22:22] it's a very very serious
[1:22:26] relationship very serious
[1:22:30] isaiah chapter 41 the prophet as i
[1:22:34] mentioned the same thing
[1:22:42] are we together praise the lord
[1:22:51] isaiah 41 verse 8.
[1:23:09] you can you can just read read the
[1:23:11] entire chapter and see how the prophet
[1:23:13] isaiah built build a picture your very
[1:23:16] beautiful picture he built
[1:23:18] about uh god dealing with israel
[1:23:32] amen
[1:23:38] but thou israel
[1:23:42] is seven jacob whom they have choosing
[1:23:46] the seed of abraham my friend
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:56] and we know also that james pick up that
[1:24:00] also in the book of james
[1:24:02] where he called abraham the friend of
[1:24:04] god
[1:24:05] so it runs through all the scripture
[1:24:08] you know it runs through all the
[1:24:10] scripture but this is what i want us to
[1:24:12] see
[1:24:13] in in here is the other uh the the
[1:24:16] reason there is because
[1:24:19] that relationship was
[1:24:22] was and is very important
[1:24:25] solomon the great says in the book of
[1:24:27] proverbs he that won't friend
[1:24:30] must show himself friendly
[1:24:36] praise the lord he that won't friend
[1:24:39] must show himself friendly
[1:24:44] jesus when he came he said make friends
[1:24:46] with mamas
[1:24:47] that in the days of adversities they
[1:24:50] might help you
[1:24:54] so it's a it's a it's a relationship
[1:24:56] that is very important
[1:25:00] but you see the uh and and and that's
[1:25:03] one of the things
[1:25:04] that uh that this this
[1:25:07] this this information technology age
[1:25:11] is bringing
[1:25:14] praise to lord
[1:25:17] people can uh uh you know can rather
[1:25:22] make friends online and you know be
[1:25:25] friendly in distance
[1:25:29] friendship don't work that way
[1:25:33] it don't work that way praise the lord
[1:25:40] they can be so nice and so friendly
[1:25:43] and then uh uh laughing face and
[1:25:47] posting this other one in order that one
[1:25:50] put those two
[1:25:50] persons together for a short period of
[1:25:54] time
[1:25:56] they get so bored there's no connection
[1:26:01] that's not friendship
[1:26:05] it's not friendship
[1:26:13] a friendship in distance was ever able
[1:26:17] to be achieved god wouldn't have become
[1:26:20] flesh
[1:26:23] he wouldn't have become flesh besides
[1:26:25] coming down
[1:26:27] to pay the ransom price to be our
[1:26:30] kingsman redeemer
[1:26:32] one of the reason why he came down was
[1:26:35] to become
[1:26:36] our friend
[1:26:39] praise the lord
[1:26:42] somebody said when jesus when god
[1:26:45] took him flesh he became our neighbor
[1:26:50] because now he can feel what we feel
[1:26:56] when jesus said who is your neighbor
[1:27:01] he became our he became our nestor
[1:27:04] neighbor
[1:27:08] such a very very important
[1:27:12] relationship but yet is neglected
[1:27:17] it's neglected and that is
[1:27:20] one of the problems of our homes
[1:27:24] of our church of our marriages
[1:27:32] of our parenting
[1:27:36] is because we are stuck in one
[1:27:38] relationship
[1:27:42] and we don't have the center
[1:27:46] that keeps it together
[1:27:53] praise the lord
[1:27:58] we don't have the center that keeps it
[1:28:02] together
[1:28:08] glory be to god it's not so it's not so
[1:28:10] difficult for parents to make the child
[1:28:12] to honest
[1:28:13] i'm your parent i'm your father
[1:28:18] it's not difficult that one is a
[1:28:21] straight shot
[1:28:23] can't miss it
[1:28:28] but there was a time genesis 1 god was a
[1:28:32] parent
[1:28:35] amen
[1:28:40] when he lost his son
[1:28:44] and lost the word
[1:28:47] right after the floor he changed his
[1:28:49] approach
[1:28:53] he says i'll become i'll become a friend
[1:28:55] now
[1:28:58] so he started dealing with abraham
[1:29:02] praise the lord
[1:29:06] in a different covenant unconditional
[1:29:16] you know why friendship is unconditional
[1:29:21] because friendship is a gift let me read
[1:29:24] a quote to you from brother branham
[1:29:30] praise the lord are we together
[1:29:38] amen but bam says who is this
[1:29:41] in the message here he says uh
[1:29:49] no what does what does that year
[1:29:54] talking about elijah if education
[1:29:58] is the way out to freedom
[1:30:02] why don't it act with all the
[1:30:06] education we have in the world if shush
[1:30:08] was standing
[1:30:09] or so forth is the way out why don't it
[1:30:13] out
[1:30:14] why don't it act
[1:30:20] if paying other nations to be
[1:30:23] our body and we find out
[1:30:28] they turn his against us
[1:30:32] praise the lord
[1:30:35] all the other nations all the other uh
[1:30:38] uh religious and form of worship
[1:30:42] has rights only the christians don't
[1:30:46] have right
[1:30:49] muslims can leave work and go and pray
[1:30:52] they can leave and
[1:30:54] you know take take an oath to be on
[1:30:58] american citizens with hot on their head
[1:31:00] and
[1:31:01] i mean they would do every other thing
[1:31:03] they have religious right
[1:31:07] but when a christian holds their bible
[1:31:08] in their hands this is
[1:31:10] uh i mean at this place you know you
[1:31:12] don't practice religion here
[1:31:19] but branham says paying others to be our
[1:31:21] buddy and we find out they turn right
[1:31:24] turn their heels against us just as soon
[1:31:27] as they can
[1:31:29] and you can't buy friendship with money
[1:31:33] friendship is a gift that's the reason
[1:31:36] why
[1:31:36] it's unconditional a fall
[1:31:40] under the unconditional coveting
[1:31:43] because it's a gift
[1:31:50] praise the lord it's a gift
[1:32:06] and that's the reason why sometimes and
[1:32:08] many times
[1:32:10] you know when talking to young people
[1:32:14] young people than all people in
[1:32:17] you know talking to people they know and
[1:32:19] want to go
[1:32:20] into uh relationships
[1:32:27] that's that's some of the things i tell
[1:32:29] them
[1:32:32] praise the lord and i think that
[1:32:36] many have talked we know that in the
[1:32:39] message we don't practice dating
[1:32:41] you know even though it's a form of
[1:32:44] friendship
[1:32:45] but because of all of the things that is
[1:32:47] attached to it
[1:32:49] amen and
[1:32:52] but sometimes many people will take
[1:32:56] courtship as their time of friendship
[1:33:01] and uh and i i don't see it like that
[1:33:07] you know courtship is is it's a higher
[1:33:09] level of friendship
[1:33:13] it's it's a friendship where you are
[1:33:14] becoming more intentional
[1:33:19] but before you become intentional
[1:33:23] you have to be a friend
[1:33:28] you have to start by just being a friend
[1:33:34] and
[1:33:39] is that friendship of respect
[1:33:44] praise the lord
[1:33:48] i mean we you have we we you know we
[1:33:51] have all of these things going on and we
[1:33:53] see a lot of a lot of the problems and
[1:33:55] and things that is happening you know
[1:33:58] when
[1:33:58] and and sometimes you know what uh
[1:34:03] people get married and then this it
[1:34:05] almost looks like they are surprised
[1:34:07] they think that whoa
[1:34:08] did i marry the wrong person
[1:34:12] praise the lord no it was the same
[1:34:14] person you love
[1:34:18] what was lacking was you did not have a
[1:34:21] friendship
[1:34:25] when you came to know one another all
[1:34:27] that was in your mind
[1:34:28] was to have a home and settle down
[1:34:33] you did not have a friendship
[1:34:37] so noah is not the wrong person it's i
[1:34:39] mean it's the same person you love
[1:34:41] it's the same person you couldn't sleep
[1:34:42] about
[1:34:45] sleep was so short
[1:34:48] it's the same god
[1:34:52] praise the lord but because there was
[1:34:55] not a friendship
[1:34:56] you know i talked to some few young
[1:34:58] people young guys and
[1:35:00] you know and they will ask me some
[1:35:02] questions the first question i
[1:35:04] asked him what are the stages of
[1:35:06] marriage that you know
[1:35:11] this journey you want to take
[1:35:14] what are the stages you know
[1:35:18] praise the lord
[1:35:22] one says
[1:35:25] you have to have the holy ghost
[1:35:34] you have to be working
[1:35:37] you have to have a house
[1:35:44] i say i told him i said
[1:35:47] that's that's good
[1:35:52] that's beautiful and it's just it's a
[1:35:54] question that makes
[1:35:55] makes the young people nervous
[1:35:58] you know and uh sometimes it's it might
[1:36:01] appear
[1:36:02] like you're trying to attack them or
[1:36:04] you're trying to tell them that they
[1:36:06] don't they
[1:36:06] they don't know what they are doing
[1:36:08] they're not prepared and you know and
[1:36:10] all of that
[1:36:12] you know but i try to take my time to
[1:36:15] explain to them
[1:36:16] and i always bring them to this place of
[1:36:22] friendship
[1:36:25] praise the lord
[1:36:28] you know then there is one there is one
[1:36:30] element
[1:36:32] you know that uh that uh does not work
[1:36:35] with friendship you
[1:36:36] you can you can hide
[1:36:40] you know you can hire your friends as
[1:36:42] you cannot hide from a friend
[1:36:44] you can also hire your friends
[1:36:51] praise the lord so just in that time of
[1:36:54] friendship
[1:36:55] the the the the young woman was
[1:36:59] she must be able to talk to her mom and
[1:37:01] dad about her friend
[1:37:03] the boy must be able to do it and
[1:37:06] and what what actually you are doing is
[1:37:08] that you are providing protection for
[1:37:10] yourself
[1:37:16] because after all he's just your friend
[1:37:25] praise the lord
[1:37:29] am i supposed to be teaching stages to
[1:37:32] marriage
[1:37:37] abraham the friend of god that's what
[1:37:39] we're talking about tonight
[1:37:41] praise the lord but it's very important
[1:37:44] you know what is very important
[1:37:46] because when that stage is net
[1:37:49] you will not you will not achieve the
[1:37:51] fullness
[1:37:52] but you have to have the foundation
[1:37:56] because your entire life journey
[1:38:02] everything you would do it will be built
[1:38:04] around that
[1:38:06] everything you would do see it in the
[1:38:08] life of abraham
[1:38:11] everything this this this that god is
[1:38:15] saying about abraham
[1:38:16] was not at the beginning of his journey
[1:38:21] this was just before he would even go
[1:38:23] down to sodom
[1:38:27] he had given abraham the promise and and
[1:38:30] and you have spoken to abraham according
[1:38:32] to the time of life
[1:38:33] and and he just realized now we we are
[1:38:36] in a season i can't hide anything from
[1:38:38] my friend
[1:38:39] i've trusted this guy
[1:38:43] praise the lord
[1:38:47] would there be disappointment in
[1:38:48] friendship yeah abraham disappointed god
[1:38:51] he needed never supposed to go down
[1:38:52] there
[1:38:53] to uh to egypt he never supposed to say
[1:38:55] that that is his wife
[1:38:57] but you see friendship is that uh you
[1:38:59] you you
[1:39:00] learn to understand the person you are
[1:39:02] dealing with brother branham said this
[1:39:04] let me let me read it so we we can we
[1:39:06] can be able to cover the night here
[1:39:08] or they took the time
[1:39:12] maybe something wrong with the clock so
[1:39:15] he says to the message who is this he
[1:39:17] says
[1:39:19] he says that's right he
[1:39:22] knows the nature of god
[1:39:25] this this really thrilled me when i read
[1:39:27] it he knows the nature of god
[1:39:30] because he was a friend of god
[1:39:38] you know you know the person you know
[1:39:41] what makes them
[1:39:42] mad you know what makes them happy
[1:39:46] you understand the person
[1:39:49] you are you are understanding this
[1:39:51] person you are learning this person
[1:39:54] praise the lord and i mean it's not it's
[1:39:57] not an overnight thinking
[1:39:58] it's not i mean it's something i mean if
[1:40:02] you
[1:40:02] if you will remain friends for life
[1:40:10] that's the thing you have to understand
[1:40:12] the nature
[1:40:16] as he knew the nature of god god
[1:40:19] also knew his nature and he says
[1:40:22] i know him i know him i know
[1:40:26] abraham
[1:40:30] praise the lord and that's the reason
[1:40:34] why god
[1:40:36] sent us or gave us a son of man ministry
[1:40:40] he gave us a life story about a prophet
[1:40:44] and in in all of the things that he did
[1:40:48] in brother branham ministry and you see
[1:40:51] how god
[1:40:52] even brought brother branham to that
[1:40:55] place of
[1:40:56] having him as a friend
[1:41:00] even from from seven years old says
[1:41:03] do not drink do not smoke do not defile
[1:41:06] your body brother branham terrified run
[1:41:08] into his mother
[1:41:09] scared to death
[1:41:16] praise the lord he didn't understand why
[1:41:18] i was there he was not
[1:41:19] from a religious home he was not born in
[1:41:21] the message
[1:41:24] praise the lord wanted to be like other
[1:41:27] boys
[1:41:28] but he was protecting his friend
[1:41:34] trying to keep him from drinking and
[1:41:37] defying his body and doing different
[1:41:44] things
[1:41:49] are we together
[1:41:57] so that's that's one that's one that's
[1:41:59] one
[1:42:00] ingredient there of friendship he knows
[1:42:03] the nature
[1:42:05] of god because he was a friend of god he
[1:42:07] knows
[1:42:08] how to take him because
[1:42:11] he knows that his promises no matter how
[1:42:15] foolish they look or
[1:42:18] how simple they look
[1:42:22] or how unreasonable they look
[1:42:26] you see like even you come to this place
[1:42:29] where we are
[1:42:31] and the internet filled with errors
[1:42:36] and have to say this about brother
[1:42:38] branham life they have to say this about
[1:42:40] brother brandon they have to
[1:42:41] you know they just it just put all sorts
[1:42:43] of things there
[1:42:45] you find that
[1:42:48] one time before all of these men
[1:42:50] discover whatever they think they have
[1:42:52] discovered
[1:42:53] they claim to have loved this message
[1:42:57] they claim to have loved the prophet
[1:43:01] but you see he was just what they call
[1:43:04] a prophet and he was not afraid to them
[1:43:09] because you don't treat your friend like
[1:43:11] that
[1:43:13] you don't treat your friend like that
[1:43:17] you don't be a friend to someone and get
[1:43:19] a bunch of dirt on them
[1:43:21] and then go on the internet and go and
[1:43:23] put it there you don't treat your friend
[1:43:24] like that
[1:43:28] people that go and put their fast church
[1:43:30] forces on internet and home fastest on
[1:43:33] the internet
[1:43:34] it just shows that they don't have no
[1:43:35] sense no ground of friendship
[1:43:46] praise the lord
[1:43:50] because when a man is your friend you
[1:43:52] understand his nature
[1:43:54] no matter what his age what his
[1:43:57] experience
[1:43:58] you understand his nature to know he's a
[1:44:00] human
[1:44:02] so if he makes mistake you are able to
[1:44:04] accommodate it
[1:44:08] you don't take the mistake that he made
[1:44:10] and cover up
[1:44:11] all the years of friendship he taught
[1:44:14] you to read your bible
[1:44:15] he taught you how to look for prophecy
[1:44:18] in the bible
[1:44:19] all of these things he teach you over
[1:44:21] the years you found one single thought
[1:44:31] that's what a man would do when his wife
[1:44:35] is not his friend
[1:44:37] she's just a wife but she's not afraid
[1:44:46] that's what a pastor would do when the
[1:44:50] people he preached to are not their
[1:44:51] friends
[1:44:53] they they disagreed he would blast them
[1:44:56] all over the country
[1:44:59] oh yeah you can disagree with a man and
[1:45:02] still respect him
[1:45:04] that's what friendship is about who told
[1:45:06] you friends don't disagree
[1:45:11] that's the thing that make the
[1:45:12] friendship sweet you disagree you argue
[1:45:16] you shout
[1:45:19] i have a buddha in myself even even
[1:45:22] brother brother stephen nigeria when
[1:45:23] stephen
[1:45:24] jarrow came here he's my good friend we
[1:45:26] set up two a.m in the morning
[1:45:28] we fast we fast we
[1:45:31] yell and then after we get hungry better
[1:45:34] let's go and look for food
[1:45:35] i tell you i'm tired let's go and find
[1:45:37] food you don't you are not married yet
[1:45:39] let's go and find food
[1:45:42] we go we eat and we we start laughing
[1:45:45] ourselves to say we
[1:45:47] the next day come again we sit down we
[1:45:49] look at what we are looking at
[1:45:50] i said look i don't see it that way
[1:45:55] but we are very good friends
[1:45:59] with all your friends don't disagree
[1:46:07] that's when you have a prophet you only
[1:46:09] want him as a prophet
[1:46:10] you want him to be holy with wings
[1:46:14] you get a little thinking oh yeah they
[1:46:15] say the prophet did this all the
[1:46:17] prophet did this he was not afraid to
[1:46:21] you
[1:46:25] if you were god abraham would not be
[1:46:27] your friend
[1:46:30] because you were put on the internet
[1:46:36] abraham live
[1:46:39] i found that paper in a court they say
[1:46:41] abraham said the woman was not here why
[1:46:43] he lie
[1:46:49] god was not sleeping when abraham did
[1:46:51] that but god
[1:46:53] says i know him i know him he's my
[1:46:56] friend
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:47:06] and then you think you can gather things
[1:47:10] those that are already falling will fall
[1:47:14] but they are sons and daughters that are
[1:47:17] standing
[1:47:18] they are rooted in the love of god
[1:47:35] they are rooted in the love of god
[1:47:43] you love the lord tonight
[1:47:46] praise the lord
[1:47:50] praise the lord he says he knows the
[1:47:52] nature of god because he was a friend of
[1:47:55] god
[1:47:55] he know how to take him because he knows
[1:47:59] that his promises no matter how
[1:48:01] foolish they look
[1:48:04] or how simple they look or how
[1:48:07] unreasonable
[1:48:09] how unreasonable
[1:48:15] they were truth because god says so
[1:48:19] and to abraham they are set to it
[1:48:26] towards true child of god you you
[1:48:30] that saturday the word of god saves it
[1:48:37] like billy paul who says god thought
[1:48:39] that brother branham spoke it
[1:48:44] the church say amen and that's set away
[1:48:48] praise the lord
[1:48:54] brother barnum says and that's the way
[1:48:56] every seed of abraham does today
[1:49:01] that's the way the born again christian
[1:49:04] does today no matter what the word says
[1:49:07] what sign says
[1:49:10] what they say this that or the other
[1:49:13] gods were
[1:49:14] staying above it all
[1:49:17] and what is god's word behold i send you
[1:49:20] elijah the prophet
[1:49:21] that's god's word said it all amen
[1:49:24] what do you get a proof of system people
[1:49:26] fought in the bridge
[1:49:28] you cannot take malachi for from this
[1:49:29] bible
[1:49:32] he said in the dead of the voice of the
[1:49:34] seven injured
[1:49:35] when he shall begin to sound
[1:49:49] praise the lord but it has always been
[1:49:52] like that with men
[1:49:55] we always look for wu to blame
[1:49:58] and the reason why many of these people
[1:50:00] are coming to these places
[1:50:02] is their own failure in their lives
[1:50:06] they have not been able to hold on like
[1:50:09] abraham head on to the promise
[1:50:11] they have not been able to trust god for
[1:50:14] deliverance from habits
[1:50:20] failures have overwhelmed them he says
[1:50:22] why there is nothing to this message
[1:50:23] because
[1:50:24] i mean we've been following this thing
[1:50:26] and this thing is still happening in my
[1:50:27] life it is your problem it is not
[1:50:29] the word of god problem it's not the
[1:50:32] message problem
[1:50:34] it's your individual problem
[1:50:49] praise the lord what do you think god
[1:50:53] gave us 1 000 years of melania so we can
[1:50:55] catch up with our friendship
[1:50:59] so we can catch up with our friendship
[1:51:02] before we go to eternity
[1:51:05] praise the lord because some of us will
[1:51:07] never we'll never meet up
[1:51:09] we stay behind we are still slow and i'm
[1:51:12] not so sure
[1:51:16] i got to be careful
[1:51:20] god will give you one one thousand years
[1:51:23] sit on this bound you don't have to be
[1:51:24] careful in the millennium
[1:51:26] let me warn you before we get there
[1:51:34] praise the lord one thousand years you
[1:51:36] are free to catch up
[1:51:40] even the fool when i heard
[1:51:45] that's what isaiah said the fool were
[1:51:47] not earth
[1:51:48] so you have 1 000 years to catch up with
[1:51:51] your friendship
[1:51:53] that's how how important friendship is
[1:51:58] oh my praise the lord what was the time
[1:52:02] it's almost time
[1:52:04] ah my just catching up with this thought
[1:52:07] here
[1:52:10] praise the lord amen
[1:52:13] but it's a very very important
[1:52:17] important
[1:52:23] relationship very important relationship
[1:52:32] it's in john chapter 15.
[1:52:36] let's just take one year and then i find
[1:52:39] a place to close
[1:52:52] i know all my friends are saying you
[1:52:55] should have talked a little bit on that
[1:52:58] courtship and detain you should have
[1:53:00] talked a little bit
[1:53:04] praise the lord amen
[1:53:09] don't worry i will talk a little bit on
[1:53:10] that
[1:53:16] are we together
[1:53:20] you love the lord amen what a wonderful
[1:53:23] father
[1:53:24] we serve
[1:53:28] he's a wonderful wonderful savior
[1:53:32] praise the lord amen
[1:53:39] now you see jesus year
[1:53:43] john chapter 14 15 he was
[1:53:47] he was coming to the end of his ministry
[1:53:53] jesus from the beginning of his ministry
[1:53:55] started dealing with these guys calling
[1:53:57] them matthew john
[1:53:58] andrews following him after his witness
[1:54:00] what happened
[1:54:02] but every one of them were
[1:54:05] a bit suspicious because they saw this
[1:54:09] man discerning calling people name
[1:54:15] philip when i called natanya when he got
[1:54:18] there
[1:54:18] jesus told nathaniel all of this they
[1:54:21] had never seen that before
[1:54:25] their churches were not teaching those
[1:54:26] things
[1:54:29] so they were watching him from afar
[1:54:32] amen you see that brother branham will
[1:54:35] demonstrate some of these things and he
[1:54:37] says uh
[1:54:38] uh uh jonah uh a simon
[1:54:42] father would tell his boys when they go
[1:54:45] to fish and say some one of these days
[1:54:47] moses said the lord god would raise up a
[1:54:50] prophet like unto me
[1:54:52] amen and he will start talking this and
[1:54:55] and you know
[1:54:56] uh talking about solomon how he had this
[1:54:58] great gift in his life
[1:55:00] you know he can you knew the trust of
[1:55:03] people and all of these things
[1:55:05] because those seed were already sold
[1:55:11] look at the woman at the well
[1:55:15] she says our our father taught us these
[1:55:18] things there was a seed
[1:55:19] that was sold that's why she could say i
[1:55:24] perceive that you are a prophet
[1:55:29] but we were told that when the messiah
[1:55:31] comes these are the things he would do
[1:55:33] when jesus says i'm heed the sea was
[1:55:35] already touched
[1:55:38] amen she has already witnesses i mean
[1:55:41] she just
[1:55:42] yeah come and see the man they have told
[1:55:45] me
[1:55:45] all the things so jesus from the
[1:55:47] beginning of his ministry
[1:55:49] he started he started building a
[1:55:51] friendship with these with these uh
[1:55:52] disciples he would take them
[1:55:54] you know on the side you take them on
[1:55:56] the mountain take them apart
[1:56:01] he was doing all of that to build
[1:56:03] friendship build confidence with him
[1:56:08] praise the lord he was building
[1:56:11] friendship
[1:56:11] relationship that's how friendship
[1:56:14] builds
[1:56:17] praise the lord
[1:56:23] are we together
[1:56:26] when he when he came to this time of his
[1:56:28] ministry
[1:56:36] he told his disciples
[1:56:42] praise the lord verse 13
[1:56:46] sin john 15 he said greater love have no
[1:56:49] man than this
[1:56:50] that a man laid down his life for his
[1:56:54] friends
[1:56:56] you have come to that hour he's
[1:56:58] communicating with them
[1:57:02] praise the lord so right there
[1:57:05] jesus is telling them that he had
[1:57:06] brought him
[1:57:08] into a friendship relationship
[1:57:12] that all of this why that were traveling
[1:57:16] in the way he was dealing with them
[1:57:18] he was teaching them he says no these
[1:57:22] things is not for the public two years
[1:57:24] this this is for you two year
[1:57:28] this is greater love
[1:57:31] i have no man than for the man to lay
[1:57:33] down his life for his friends
[1:57:37] praise the lord
[1:57:41] henceforth i call you
[1:57:45] not seven for the seven knoweth now what
[1:57:49] the lord does
[1:57:51] but i call you friends
[1:57:54] i'm taking you from judaism i'm taking
[1:57:57] you from the lord
[1:57:59] i'm bringing you into a more
[1:58:03] intimate more closer relationship
[1:58:10] so god's the way he deal with us
[1:58:13] is in a progressive relationship
[1:58:16] when we are born again we are sons and
[1:58:18] daughters of god
[1:58:21] but then he teach us by his word he
[1:58:23] pulled us aside
[1:58:25] like brother branham said in adoption he
[1:58:27] will pull this one aside and just give
[1:58:29] him a little blessing
[1:58:30] because he have trusted you with few
[1:58:32] trials in your life
[1:58:34] and you did not misbehave
[1:58:45] it says i pull you from the lord
[1:58:47] children
[1:58:48] you are no longer sevens brother branham
[1:58:51] says even isaiah we just read as i refer
[1:58:54] to them sevens all through the old
[1:58:55] testament
[1:58:56] they were all referred to as sevens
[1:59:01] but jesus is bringing them to a more
[1:59:04] closer relationship
[1:59:06] i no longer call you sevens
[1:59:09] you are my friends
[1:59:13] you are my friends
[1:59:16] in john chapter 20 after he he after the
[1:59:19] resurrection
[1:59:21] he says now you are breadwins
[1:59:28] oh my goodness
[1:59:33] henceforth i i i call you now seven for
[1:59:36] the seven no and now what the lord does
[1:59:38] but i call you friends for all
[1:59:42] things that i have heard of my father
[1:59:46] i made it known unto you the same
[1:59:49] i am that made abraham there is nothing
[1:59:52] i will hide from abraham everything i
[1:59:55] have heard of the father
[1:59:58] that that is that that area of trust
[2:00:01] that's what god wants you to trust him
[2:00:05] it's the relationship of friendship
[2:00:08] you are a son of god you will never lose
[2:00:11] your salvation
[2:00:12] but you see if you don't come into a
[2:00:14] friendship relationship with god
[2:00:16] you you can live an honor privilege
[2:00:19] christian life
[2:00:22] because you are not afraid
[2:00:27] so the devil will take your mistakes and
[2:00:29] whip you and then
[2:00:30] and then you come here you confess and
[2:00:32] and then then you're
[2:00:33] another day you are in and already you
[2:00:35] are out because you have not stepped
[2:00:37] into a friendship
[2:00:38] right
[2:00:46] you are not afraid
[2:00:51] you are just a seven you come wednesday
[2:00:53] night you sing you serve god
[2:00:54] sunday morning you do your service to
[2:00:56] god
[2:01:00] you are just a seven oh our church said
[2:01:03] we must not do this oh
[2:01:04] the message said we must not do that oh
[2:01:06] that mess you are not a friend
[2:01:09] you are not a friend
[2:01:19] i'm not talking about a bride now i'm
[2:01:21] talking about a friend
[2:01:24] because that's another level of
[2:01:26] relationship
[2:01:28] i'm talking about frame that's the
[2:01:31] reason why we are not enjoying our
[2:01:33] marriage relationship
[2:01:36] we have been brought into a union with
[2:01:38] christ
[2:01:39] we are not enjoying it because
[2:01:44] we have not had this friendship with him
[2:01:46] we have not had the friendship with the
[2:01:48] one that we love
[2:01:56] you are not enjoying your relationship
[2:01:58] as a son with the father
[2:02:01] you know he is your father no doubt you
[2:02:04] know that he's your father
[2:02:05] but there is something that is lacking
[2:02:08] friendship
[2:02:12] if friendship is not there you will not
[2:02:14] enjoy the relationship
[2:02:16] of father and son if friendship is not
[2:02:18] it's not there
[2:02:19] you will not enjoy a bright and bright
[2:02:22] room relationship
[2:02:24] there is no formal relationship you will
[2:02:26] enjoy
[2:02:28] if you don't have friendship
[2:02:35] praise the lord the preacher can come on
[2:02:39] the pulpit
[2:02:40] he can bless you he can i mean the
[2:02:43] preacher preached he preached by
[2:02:44] inspiration
[2:02:46] and he says i know that me he was
[2:02:48] talking to him
[2:02:51] when he didn't recall your name
[2:02:54] those days the brother that was
[2:02:56] preaching to us when we came into faith
[2:02:58] he will call you by name and ask you to
[2:02:59] stand up
[2:03:02] so that one pound everybody know that
[2:03:04] you okay coming your way
[2:03:10] praise the lord amen
[2:03:13] but you see even if the preacher called
[2:03:16] your name or he don't call your name
[2:03:20] if that level of friendship is there
[2:03:23] you know that he's not attacking you to
[2:03:26] hurt you
[2:03:29] he never spent the whole night up
[2:03:31] praying just to come and attack you
[2:03:34] just to come and hurt you or just to
[2:03:36] come and embarrass you
[2:03:42] because love is corrective
[2:03:51] that's the reason why that friendship
[2:03:53] has to be there
[2:03:57] it has to be
[2:04:14] praise the lord we can go on and go on
[2:04:26] but the time will not allow us tonight
[2:04:29] so
[2:04:30] if the lord willing we we can get back
[2:04:32] to this
[2:04:33] or maybe the law might china us into
[2:04:36] something
[2:04:37] but you think about it
[2:04:40] think about how friendship is very
[2:04:43] important
[2:04:44] in all your forms of relationship
[2:04:48] for you to get the best out of faith
[2:04:51] you have to be your friend
[2:04:59] you have to be afraid
[2:05:05] musicians you can come forward tonight
[2:05:31] what a friend we have in jesus let you
[2:05:34] sing there tonight
[2:05:37] [Music]
[2:05:39] brother branham said in the message the
[2:05:40] weight of a true prophet he says
[2:05:43] but the word of god will endure forever
[2:05:45] upon the rock
[2:05:46] i will build my hope forever upon the
[2:05:49] word
