[0:00] [Music]
[2:02] Greetings to brother and sister Green
[2:04] and all that's here this morning. And it
[2:06] is a privilege that I feel I have given
[2:10] to me to come to this uh place of
[2:13] worship to make a few announcements. I
[2:16] don't want to take brother Green's time
[2:18] here because I heard brother Green
[2:20] several times speak and I certainly was
[2:24] influenced as he brought the word of the
[2:26] Lord to us. I was so humble about it
[2:28] yesterday. He said, "I don't get the
[2:30] word from the Lord as maybe it would
[2:33] come in revelation as as it's been sent,
[2:36] but said I like to to stress upon what
[2:40] has been said." He said uh like when
[2:44] Paul wrote something in the Bible, I
[2:46] come here to stress upon what he said.
[2:48] Said I have no message only just to
[2:51] stress on what's already been said from
[2:53] the Lord. Oh, that is really remarkable
[2:56] that a young fellow like that would say
[3:00] make a remark like that. Now, let's just
[3:03] have a word of prayer together.
[3:06] Dear God,
[3:09] I hardly know how to start for I feel
[3:15] you're here today and in your presence
[3:18] we always feel so glid
[3:21] and I I thank you for this privilege now
[3:24] Lord that thou has granted this place to
[3:26] us. We pray that you'll meet with us
[3:29] every time that we meet here. And may
[3:33] your great spirit move over this city.
[3:38] May we be able to bring this gospel
[3:41] message that has been given to us and
[3:44] presented to our hands in this last
[3:47] days. May it be fulfilled in you. Get
[3:50] every soul out of Tucson and around that
[3:53] you've ordained to life. Grant these
[3:56] things, Father, in the name of Jesus
[3:58] Christ. Amen.
[4:01] I think I want to read a little verse of
[4:04] scripture here this morning, just before
[4:06] I say these words that I wish to say.
[4:08] It's found over in Acts, the 7th chapter
[4:11] of the book of Acts. While you're
[4:14] turning to that, we'll begin with the
[4:16] 44th verse. Now, we're going to Sri this
[4:21] week, this coming week for a series of
[4:24] services. And now, we're going to try,
[4:27] if the Lord willing, um, Brother Moore,
[4:30] Brother Jack Moore, very good friend of
[4:33] both brother Perry and I, and we love
[4:37] Brother Jack. The message I think kind
[4:40] of baffled him a little, especially on
[4:43] some of the things that we hold dear and
[4:46] believe that that it came to us through
[4:49] the opening of the seven seals as we
[4:52] believe it such as serpent seed, the
[4:54] eternal security of the believers and
[4:56] and so forth. some of those messages
[4:58] that maybe to others we don't think this
[5:01] is hard but it if you've got to open
[5:05] your heart to truth
[5:07] we believe that we're living in the the
[5:10] end time. Amen. That's just so real to
[5:14] us that we're just at the end of the
[5:16] road and um to speak in some other man's
[5:21] church while you want to honor that
[5:24] man's uh hospitality of of giving you
[5:28] that opportunity to come into his
[5:30] church. And I certainly knowing that
[5:32] they don't believe in that and I would
[5:36] honor them enough that there's plenty
[5:37] more that I can speak on there beside uh
[5:40] bringing that in unless it's just the
[5:44] Holy Spirit having to push it a little.
[5:46] You see, then I would certainly say as
[5:47] he said and I don't know no better than
[5:50] to do that. I hope I never learn any
[5:52] better just to say it the way he said
[5:54] it. Now let us read just a a verse or
[5:57] two here out of the the seventh chapter
[6:00] of the book of Acts beginning with the
[6:02] 44th verse.
[6:05] Our fathers had the tabernacle of
[6:07] witness in the wilderness, as he has
[6:10] appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he
[6:13] should make it according to the fashion
[6:15] that he had seen, which also our father
[6:20] came after brought in with Jesus, unto
[6:25] the possession of the Gentiles, whom God
[6:27] drove out before the face of our
[6:29] fathers, unto the days of David, who
[6:32] found favor before God, and desire
[6:34] desired to find a tabernacle
[6:38] for the God of Jacob, but Solomon built
[6:42] him a house. How be it, the Most High
[6:45] dwelleth not in temples made with hands,
[6:49] as saith the prophet. Heaven is my
[6:52] throne, earth is my foottool. What house
[6:55] will you build me, sayaeth the Lord, or
[6:57] what is the place of my rest? Has not my
[7:00] hands made all these things?
[7:03] Upon this the reading of this scripture,
[7:07] I want to say the few words that I want
[7:09] to say before brother Perry brings the
[7:11] morning message. I find this one of the
[7:15] great moments of my visit to Tucson.
[7:20] I come here because that I was led to
[7:23] come here. I come here because that the
[7:25] Holy Spirit through a vision sent me
[7:28] here.
[7:29] Uh know that might seem strange maybe
[7:33] but he as far as I know anything that I
[7:37] know of God I was sent by a vision to
[7:40] Tucson. Amen. I've wondered how I ever
[7:43] was sent to this desert place
[7:47] and then here where there is
[7:51] spiritually speaking
[7:53] uh over the city. I don't know of any
[7:56] place that's any more spiritual dead in
[8:00] in the city of Tucson. There is war
[8:04] between the churches. There is fusses
[8:06] between the congregations. There's no
[8:09] unity and everyone grabbing and holding
[8:11] and squeezing and trying to get this one
[8:14] and proceliting.
[8:15] It is a desert spiritually speaking
[8:18] also.
[8:20] But then I read in the Bible
[8:22] that where God called Moses away from
[8:27] his loved ones and all that was dear to
[8:29] him and sent him into the wilderness to
[8:31] write the laws of the Bible. That was
[8:34] the Old Testament. The first four books,
[8:36] Genesis, Leviticus, and Deuteromy and
[8:39] Exodus. He um I never said I'm missing
[8:42] routine but that four books that really
[8:45] is the Old Testament because the rest of
[8:48] it was what the prophets said in the
[8:50] Psalms of David and so forth but the
[8:53] Chronicles of the Kings. But this was
[8:56] the fundamental
[8:58] of the Old Testament was Moses wrote
[9:01] them after he was called from his
[9:03] homeland where he had been born and
[9:05] brought up among his people and was sent
[9:08] into the desert to write this book of
[9:12] the Old Testament. Then I find that in
[9:15] the book of the New Testament where Paul
[9:18] which is the author or not the author
[9:20] but the writer of the New Testament he
[9:25] also was drove out from among his people
[9:30] and by the spirit into the Arabia where
[9:34] he was three and a half years
[9:37] to uh find the inspiration and Paul is
[9:41] the chief writer of the New Testament.
[9:43] Amen. Now, there's Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[9:46] and John, but they were scribes that
[9:48] just wrote what Jesus said as they
[9:50] followed him along. And but you take uh
[9:53] the book to Timothy and to the Romans
[9:56] and to the Hebrews and so forth, Paul
[10:00] received inspiration to write the New
[10:03] Testament, taking all the Old Testament
[10:05] as a shadow and setting it in order. And
[10:08] God honored it and made it the New
[10:10] Testament.
[10:12] Now, if the Old Testament
[10:16] had to be,
[10:34] now if the Old Testament
[10:39] had to be drove from the the writer had
[10:42] to be drove from his people into the
[10:45] wilderness
[10:47] to get inspiration to write the Old
[10:50] Testament. And in the New Testament, the
[10:53] writer
[10:55] was drove by the author into a desert
[10:58] place to get the inspiration to write
[10:59] the New Testament. And the books are
[11:02] sealed with seven seals. It would also
[11:05] require the same, I believe, in these
[11:07] days to open those seven seals. Amen. To
[11:10] leave what you hold dear,
[11:13] to what you cherish, a little home that
[11:16] was given to me by the people and
[11:18] amongst all my people and friends and a
[11:20] church that was flourishing and had
[11:23] nothing
[11:25] lacking
[11:26] and uh to leave that, pull right away
[11:29] from it and move away out into a desert
[11:31] where you knew nobody and everything
[11:33] against you. But there's something
[11:38] about God that he drives a man to do
[11:40] things that's beyond any thinking of his
[11:42] own. So it can be to the glory and honor
[11:44] of God.
[11:48] And I feel that not self honor, but I I
[11:52] feel the privilege it it was to leave
[11:55] everything that was called dear to me.
[11:56] Amen. to get here into this wilderness
[11:59] and suffer like I have never suffered in
[12:01] my life here in this wilderness or this
[12:04] desert. But I believe that in doing that
[12:06] and obeying what God commanded to be
[12:09] done, God has opened to us the mysteries
[12:13] of this last day. Amen. And we are here
[12:18] uh with this message.
[12:21] Now there was many people who followed
[12:23] me and that's not unusual. Usually a
[12:27] person we people love one another and it
[12:30] love will drive you to do things you
[12:33] don't think you would do. That's right.
[12:35] And many of you left your homes you left
[12:37] all just to go come out here in the
[12:40] desert. Many has called me. Many has
[12:42] asked me shall we come to Arizona?
[12:46] Would it be a good place for us? Well,
[12:48] as it was said about Moses and them, it
[12:50] was no place of fruit, no place of
[12:54] pomegranate here. There's not much work
[12:57] to do and living is high. The cost of
[12:59] living is high. It's a really a rough
[13:02] place to live in is Tucson, Arizona.
[13:05] Wages are poor and and food is high and
[13:09] rent it's it's a horrible place to live
[13:12] in that manner. But it's healthy. It's
[13:14] dry.
[13:17] And we sometimes we mustn't get our
[13:20] minds fashioned on things of this earth.
[13:23] We must look to the leading of the Holy
[13:25] Spirit. But one thing that trouble me in
[13:29] coming here and telling people, well,
[13:32] you should not come or you should come.
[13:34] That I leave up to each individual the
[13:37] way God leads that individual to do.
[13:41] I think every one of us should do that.
[13:43] Be led by the spirit on what to do.
[13:47] And many of you here from around
[13:49] Jeffersonville and other congregation
[13:51] there. and you have uh come out here.
[13:55] Now the thing that bothered me was a
[13:58] place of worship.
[14:01] Now I realize as I read in the scripture
[14:03] here of Stevens and his address just
[14:07] before his death or they stoned him
[14:10] immediately afterwards for his message
[14:13] as he was speaking he said our fathers
[14:17] talking of the Hebrews in the early days
[14:20] how that they tried to find favor before
[14:23] God to build a place for worship.
[14:27] He said that Solomon built him a house
[14:31] or a building. We're acquainted with the
[14:35] story. But I like his next words. How be
[14:38] it, the Most High dwelleth not in houses
[14:42] that's made with hands.
[14:45] In another place over in Isaiah, he
[14:47] said, "A body has thou prepared me,
[14:53] sacrifice and offerings and buildings
[14:56] and so forth, but a body hast thou
[14:58] prepared me." Well, we realize that he
[15:01] was speaking then of the body where God
[15:03] tabernacled in Christ. But I believe
[15:06] today that the inspiration that's come
[15:09] to to brother Green
[15:14] to move here, him and sister Green
[15:16] giving up their place back in the east
[15:19] also to back in Texas to come here with
[15:24] the start with nothing
[15:27] just simply by an inspiration
[15:30] feeling that they should do it.
[15:33] I appreciate man that will follow the
[15:37] leading of Christ regardless of the cost
[15:42] it cost them.
[15:44] Though the whole world, maybe your very
[15:46] best friends think that you're wrong,
[15:49] but it isn't wrong to you.
[15:53] As long as you feel there's something
[15:55] behind it as God moving you, it's never
[15:59] wrong. and it'll always pan out right.
[16:04] See this young couple, a talented young
[16:06] man and saying this because he's sitting
[16:08] here, this young lady with her babies,
[16:12] this family to raise, quit his job and
[16:15] everything to move here.
[16:18] I realized that years ago I was called
[16:22] in the ministry. I've never made a
[16:24] successful pastor because I got a Roman
[16:27] rambling spirit. I can't be satisfied
[16:32] anywhere. Just wherever the spirit
[16:34] moves, I just got to move with it
[16:36] because I have a message.
[16:40] Jesus said, "I must preach in this other
[16:41] town also." But there are those who are
[16:45] shepherds that watch the flock.
[16:49] I'm so grateful that brother Perry
[16:53] followed the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[16:56] And today we have a tabernacle.
[17:01] It's a small one. That's just good
[17:02] enough to start with. Let's see what the
[17:04] Holy Spirit not knowing. Let's just move
[17:06] step by step. Now I believe
[17:11] if God has spoke to brother and sister
[17:14] green to come here
[17:18] and it's opened up a place where our
[17:20] children instead of on Sunday morning
[17:22] ride their bicycles and on the streets
[17:24] and running around they have a place to
[17:26] come to worship instead of us sitting
[17:28] around listen to something that we've
[17:30] heard on radio which is all right but we
[17:35] as this group of people we have a
[17:37] message for this We we believe that God
[17:39] has given us a message and brother Green
[17:43] is
[17:45] I don't want to call him my associate
[17:48] because we are well it is also my
[17:51] associate we are together in this
[17:54] message. Brother Green preaches the same
[17:56] thing a message that I believe in. Amen.
[17:59] He's left his home. He's left his
[18:00] people. He's left his church. She was a
[18:03] uh believe he was a district
[18:04] superintendent or something of one of
[18:05] the organizations and give the whole
[18:07] thing up when he heard this.
[18:10] He left everything that was dear to him
[18:12] also to come to the desert just to
[18:14] support what God is giving to us.
[18:19] I say I believe it's not only should be
[18:22] in our hearts.
[18:24] It should be our duty to back him up
[18:27] everything that we can attend the
[18:30] services to come here to worship and to
[18:33] make this a place uh where God can
[18:37] reveal to us the things that he has for
[18:39] us to reveal. And as his word said, the
[18:43] message doesn't come to me through the
[18:45] giving of the inspiration as it does to
[18:49] maybe to some of us, but he said, I'm
[18:52] here to back up what God has given.
[18:56] What a statement.
[18:59] And I believe if we will all cooperate
[19:03] together, we will put our hearts to it.
[19:07] I know that each one of you, if you feel
[19:10] like I do,
[19:13] I am so hungry to see the spirit of God
[19:17] moving. Amen. I just can't hardly stand
[19:20] it.
[19:22] Some experiences
[19:24] I've just had up in the mountain.
[19:28] Just to feel that once again.
[19:31] That's something that when I was first
[19:34] saved that was so glorious to my heart.
[19:37] And we can come into a place we can set
[19:40] and we see it among us that we're drying
[19:44] as we sit here in the desert. I get
[19:46] among my brother and they talk with me
[19:48] and I talk with them. always in a little
[19:51] way of watching feeling out there with
[19:54] the spirit as it was to see just the
[19:56] condition of that brother to see what's
[19:58] wrong. I begin to feel us all reclining
[20:02] getting away from the spirit. It's
[20:04] become too natural a thing to us. We
[20:07] must worship in the spirit where the
[20:10] spirit of God not only our message
[20:12] should be the flameth of the hour, it
[20:15] should be the flame in our hearts. Amen.
[20:18] See, it's got to be in our hearts or we
[20:20] can't we can't rightly present it to the
[20:23] people. The spirit has to pack the
[20:26] message itself.
[20:29] And I'm trusting and believing in every
[20:31] one of you to be a real Christian.
[20:33] Now, this they need Sunday school
[20:35] teachers. They're going to need a staff.
[20:39] And I want to say this so that you'll
[20:42] thoroughly understand.
[20:45] This is my church.
[20:49] I've been here three years
[20:52] and I've had one door open to me. That
[20:55] was brother Mackey asked me to come
[20:57] preach. God bless him. I haven't been
[21:00] invited by any other people. Not nothing
[21:03] against them. They're all right. Brother
[21:05] Brock, a good friend of mine, Brother
[21:07] Gilmore, many of these Pentecostal
[21:09] brethren here are very, very deep good
[21:12] friends of mine. I love them. Nothing
[21:14] against them. I understand their
[21:16] position. They can't invite me in there
[21:18] and then remain in their organization.
[21:21] See, they can't do it because if they
[21:24] do, they're kicked out.
[21:26] So, you see their position. I had the
[21:29] same thing to face. But my
[21:32] it always be seek ye first the kingdom
[21:35] of God, the will of God. Hallelujah. And
[21:38] now that brother Green God has sent him
[21:40] in here and opened us up a church of
[21:43] like precious faith that we believe in,
[21:45] we ought to be very grateful to God. And
[21:48] can every service take every place that
[21:51] we can and if we're asked to call on to
[21:56] pray to seek to do let's be soldiers
[21:59] right at the just anxious to do it.
[22:03] Keep the message honorable. Live the
[22:05] right kind of life. Don't let no smut
[22:07] come up on him. We're living too late
[22:09] now. Amen. We're too late in the hour.
[22:12] Let's live it clean. Well, my life, your
[22:15] life, all of our lives needs to be
[22:17] picked up before God.
[22:20] Our young people just ride around from
[22:23] place to place and show to show and
[22:25] drifting further and further away from
[22:27] God. Like,
[22:30] now that's the truth.
[22:32] I see it my children
[22:35] and I see myself getting to a place
[22:37] where not you you've got to assemble
[22:40] ourselves together to worship God. The
[22:42] Bible said so when we see this day
[22:44] approaching that much more come
[22:45] together. If there's only two people
[22:47] here you be one of them.
[22:50] Now that's and if we come together and
[22:52] worship together then we just something
[22:54] another about it. Jesus said where two
[22:56] or three are gathered in my name there I
[22:57] am in their midst. Now, as I said
[22:59] before, Brother Green told me and he
[23:03] said it, my wife come told me what he
[23:04] said when I was away
[23:07] that uh he said this morning the pulpit
[23:11] was open at any time. Now, I usually
[23:14] that's open for me to speak. Now,
[23:16] usually I had to drive all the way to
[23:19] Jeffersonville, Indiana to give a
[23:20] message that God gave me. Amen. To bring
[23:23] it to the people, go all the way to
[23:24] Jeffersonville, Indiana. and each one of
[23:26] you stringing across the country and
[23:27] hooking up the wires and things to get
[23:29] the message because that's what we're
[23:31] living on.
[23:33] That's what we're here for. Well, we
[23:36] don't have to do that no more.
[23:39] God gives me a message, I can walk right
[23:40] here to the pullpit and preach it and
[23:42] feel free to do it.
[23:44] And I believe by that that God Almighty
[23:47] will bless you if you'll just stand by
[23:50] this church now, this group of people.
[23:53] Not only that, but let's go out
[23:59] and see if we can't get others to come
[24:01] in. See, let's speak to others
[24:04] everywhere. Speak to them about our
[24:06] church and what it means. What our
[24:08] church, we're here. We want you to come.
[24:10] Bring in strangers. I'm sure it'll be
[24:12] good for all of us. See, we have a
[24:15] building which we're thankful for. We're
[24:18] thankful for this place together. But
[24:20] high be it, the most high dwelleth not
[24:23] in temples made with hands. See, for
[24:28] heaven is my throne, and earth is my
[24:30] foottool. And where is the place of my
[24:32] rest? But a body has thou prepared me
[24:35] for? And we are a body of Christ.
[24:39] So, as we move from one building to
[24:41] another building, I believe in bringing
[24:44] our messages and we'll come down and
[24:46] have healing services and anything the
[24:47] Lord reveals to us to do, we'll have it
[24:49] right here in the church until it swells
[24:51] out so big we have to take it somewhere
[24:53] else and somewhere else until Jesus
[24:55] comes. Amen. God bless you.
[25:03] Dear God,
[25:05] as we stand here on this platform which
[25:08] represents right over the altar here, we
[25:12] realize
[25:14] that we are a are a dying race of people
[25:19] as far as this earth is concerned.
[25:22] We look out upon the streets and see sin
[25:25] wrote everywhere.
[25:27] And if the glory of the Lord is swiftly
[25:30] departing and we know when the glory of
[25:32] the Lord goes up, so will the church go
[25:35] with it.
[25:37] God, we want to be there.
[25:40] just a few days ago standing here on the
[25:42] street corner just across the street
[25:46] watching that
[25:49] parade go down the street
[25:53] and seeing those old first war tanks
[25:57] leading the way. Then come the big heavy
[26:00] Sherman tank behind that followed on and
[26:04] on and on.
[26:06] Then the gold star mothers,
[26:09] the little broke up family with a crying
[26:11] wife and a little ragged boy had lost
[26:13] his daddy.
[26:15] An old mother had lost a son.
[26:18] Oh, how sad
[26:21] to stand on a street corner and watch
[26:24] something like that pass.
[26:27] Then noticing just as they passed this
[26:29] building, the music's changed toward
[26:32] Christian soldiers.
[26:36] playing their marches behind. But when
[26:39] they pass this spot,
[26:43] Dear God, I'm thinking of another great
[26:46] time coming, and that would be the
[26:48] resurrection,
[26:50] when the old-timers will come forth
[26:52] first, saints of patriarchs.
[26:56] For we which are alive and remain shall
[26:58] not prevent or hinder those which are
[27:01] asleep. For the trumpet of God shall
[27:03] sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[27:05] first. Then when we see that great
[27:09] system of people going marching up
[27:11] through the skies, and we be standing
[27:12] waiting for our change, knowing that
[27:15] we'll fall in line also.
[27:19] God, make us faithful soldiers.
[27:24] Only those who had really associated and
[27:27] been in the war would know what that
[27:30] really meant to see those tanks rolling
[27:32] by.
[27:34] God, we think that those who've been in
[27:36] the battle of life,
[27:38] will know what it means when we're
[27:41] waiting our turn to fall in position and
[27:43] place in the resurrection to go up.
[27:46] Is this my young brother standing here?
[27:50] welltrained, ready, dressed,
[27:55] waiting for an old man to lay hands upon
[27:58] him. One who's an old veteran from up
[28:00] there in the front lines,
[28:04] knowing that he must join the battle,
[28:06] too.
[28:09] Dear God,
[28:12] that these unworthy hands I lay upon my
[28:16] brother
[28:18] and representation of yours.
[28:21] Bless brother Green, dear God, who I
[28:23] bless in Jesus name.
[28:27] May he carry this message Lord into this
[28:31] city and wherever you are called.
[28:34] may be loyal, filled with the spirit,
[28:37] living a life above reproach.
[28:41] God,
[28:43] let him have the hearts of the people
[28:46] that he might teach them and lead them
[28:49] and direct them in the path that we all
[28:52] desire to walk.
[28:55] Granted, Lord, bless his faithful wife,
[28:57] his little children. Bless our efforts
[29:00] here together as Christian brothers here
[29:03] on earth that we may carry this gospel
[29:05] to the ends of the world.
[29:09] Send your spirit upon him, God.
[29:12] We pray in Jesus Christ's name as we
[29:14] give him to you. Amen.
[29:18] God bless you, brother Perry. The word
[29:27] [Music]
