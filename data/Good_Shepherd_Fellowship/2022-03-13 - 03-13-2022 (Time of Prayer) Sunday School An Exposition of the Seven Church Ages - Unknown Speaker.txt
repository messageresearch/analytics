[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] it must be accepted and believed by faith some will be offended by what i have set forth because they fail to understand the sovereignty of god which sets forth that god is god and because he is god one cannot defeat his counsels or thwart his will and purpose but he being omnipotent is ruling in all affairs and is doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure therefore as paul says if god should take a one lump of clay and make of that same lump one vessel unto honor and another vessel unto dishonor who can be offended and cry against him that he has the right to do this on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny yet he went even further for according to romans 14 7-9 we have the irrefutable proof that jesus paid the purchase price of the whole world and therefore he can do as he wills with his own for none of us liveth to himself and no man dies to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living ownership not relationship is meant here this is also set forth in john 17 2. as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him now if we impute omniscience to god we must also accept that he is perfect in wisdom and righteousness this plan of election and reprobation is the wisdom of god revealed in all ages even as it says in ephesians 1 3-11 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestined according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will thus if god has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the lamb's book of life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of the book of life but in the foreknowledge of god they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those whose names were never placed upon a record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of god who are his brethren then we cannot but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the lord that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live to understand this subject even more clearly it will now be wise to approach it from the standpoint of the church through the ages up until now we have been thinking in terms of the removal of the names of individuals now we want to consider not the individuals but the groups represented in the church to do so we will liken the church through the ages to the wheat plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce and multiply itself through a certain process during a certain period of time that single seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer or carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in a multiplied form jesus the great royal seed died that matchless one who is the life of the church stands in the midst of the church for all seven church ages giving his life to the church the carrier or bearer to the end that his very life will be reproduced in bodies like unto his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the royal seed will see many royal seeds like unto himself and they will be even as he is for says john we shall be like him this is what john the baptist was referring to when he said that jesus would gather the wheat into the garner that was the resurrection where the redeemed who had been elected unto eternal life came in now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life by the history or record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant a bear seed is sown soon a blade is seen but that is not the wheat yet then it grows into a stalk this is not yet wheat life is there but not the wheat then at the end of the stalk is a little spike that sends out a tassel still a wheat plant but no wheat yet then the plant is pollenized and we see the chaff grow this looks mighty like the wheat but it is not yet seed then forms the wheat in the husk it is now back to what it was originally now the ripened wheat is harvested jesus christ died he gave his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like unto himself unto glory and the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church which would be the carrier of the life of christ as the blade stalk tassel and husks were the carriers for the seed but not the seed itself so the church corporate through the ages has been the carrier of the true seed though not the seed itself that is why we can say that the book of life is the whole wheat plant let's go over that again here is that original seed that was planted it produced a blade that wasn't it it produced a stalk not it either here come husks in which the wheat is to form that isn't it the tassel appears then pollen falls on those pistols part of that plant is quickened something of that original seed that came up through the rest of the plant turns into seed why didn't the whole plant go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back to being seed because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat you have a perfect type of that in israel leaving egypt they came out about 2 million strong all escaped through the sacrificial blood all were baptized in the red sea all came up out of the water enjoying holy spirit manifestation and blessings all ate angel food all drank of the rock that followed them yet except for a very few they were not but carriers for the children who should follow them and go into canaanland all israel is not israel and all but a tiny minority had their names blotted out of the book of life we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the book of life this is the record god hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life eternal and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great royal seed jesus christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by spirit they are original now we can see why the redeemed bought back by original owner bride she was in him as eve was in adam cannot ever have her member names taken off the record she is part of him she is in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the bride is a member of him and he loses none but that is not so concerning the all in the book of life for amongst them are even those like judas etc who have a part in the record but their names are removed we can see those who come in the last days and after having done wonderful works jesus will say that he never knew them it is not that he was not aware of them his omniscience precludes that but they were not for known as in the bride and neither were they for known as amongst the righteous of the second resurrection they bore no fruit because they were outside the word did not abide in it and they therefore were sentenced to death then as we have previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aide and comfort to her those had their names remaining on the book of life and go into life everlasting finally there are those such as pharaoh who never had their names on the book of life and these are cast into the lake of fire also thus the grain of wheat that became a plant for the harvest is the record of the church and even as not all the wheat plant is wheat seed and as not all the plant is used in the harvest so with the church all the church is not the bride and neither is it all given eternal life but a part of it is gathered into the garner and a part of it is kept that it might enter into eternal life in the second resurrection and part of it which is accounted chaff is burned in the lake of fire and this is exactly what john the baptist and jesus said for john said that the wheat would be garnered and the chaff burned jesus said bind the tares and then gather the wheat the ecumenical move will bind the tare churches together for the tares must be bound first and though their end is burning they are not burned at their binding but are reserved to a later date which is at the end of the thousand years or the second resurrection but once the tears are bound the rapture can take place and does so at some time between the binding and the revelation of antichrist then will come the day when all stand together as seen in daniel the king will be there with his bride and in front of them will be the multitudes who are to be judged yes all are there all the books are opened a final disposition of all is made the harvest is indeed over the books once opened are closed in concluding this subject for this time let me refer to a statement made at its beginning wherein i said that not one scripture spoke of the lord presently compiling a record of names that is indeed so however there is a scripture pointing a future compilation it is in the 87th psalm this psalm speaks of the lord writing up the names of all those born in zion on no account can it be presumed that god has to wait until the end of ages or that period of time dealing with zion in order to know who all might be born in zion again that would preclude omniscience surely he knows who all comprised that number but what is it is it not simply the revised role wherein god simply places in a new record those names which remained after the second resurrection and pertain to zion surely that is it and i will confess his name before my father and his angels roll call in heaven if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands the great shepherd is calling his sheep by name the creative voice of god is calling them forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they had not fallen asleep it is the rapture it is the great marriage supper of the lamb and his bride but the rapture is not the only roll call there at the second resurrection at the great white throne judgment will names be confessed before the father and his angels now i have been told by those who know that the sweetest sound to a human ear is the sound of that person's name how people love to have their names before the public how they love acclaim but no earthly voice will ever sound your name as sweetly as will the voice of god if your name is in the book of life and remains there to be revealed before the holy angels what a day that will be when we hear jesus say father they confessed my name before men in the days of their earthly pilgrimage now i will confess their names before thee and all the heavenly angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches once more the spirit had spoken once again we have reviewed the record of what the spirit said to another age and we have found the record correct another age has gone by and it was fulfilled exactly as he said it would be what a consolation that is to us who hope to be in the last day bride for it causes our hearts to leap for joy that he is faithful and will perform his every promise if he was faithful and true to those of the sardisian age then he is just as true to this our age if they by his grace and power will be received and commanded by him then so will we let us go therefore to perfection and meet the lord in the air and be forever with him chapter 8 the philadelphian church age revelation 3 7-13 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast to little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches philadelphia philadelphia was 75 miles southeast of sardis it was the second largest city in lydia it was built upon several hills in a famous wine growing district its coins bore the head of backers and the figure of a bacanti priestess of bacchus the population of the city included jews christians of jewish origin and converts from heathenism the city suffered frequent earthquakes yet its duration was the longest of the seven cities of revelation in fact the city still exists under the turkish name of al-shahir or city of god the mintage of the coins suggests the deity of the city to be bacchus now bacchus is the same as ninus or nimrod he is the lamented one though most of us think of him in terms of revelry and drunkenness what illumination this brings to our minds here is a coin with the god on one side and the priestess or prophetess on the other now flip a coin does it matter which way it comes down no sir it is still the same coin that is the romish religion of jesus and mary but we are not thinking of rome only no there is not only the great harlot certainly not for she by her fornications has become a mother her daughters now are coins of the same mintage there on one side of the coin they have drawn up a worship of jesus and on the other side they have their priestess or prophetess also and she writes her creeds and dogmas and tenets and sells them to the people for salvation insisting that she and she alone has the true light how remarkable is the fact that this age is characterized by the coin for the mother and daughters are all buying their way to heaven money and not blood is the purchase price money and not spirit is the power that moves them ahead the god of this world mammon hath blinded their eyes but their dealings in death will end soon for this is the age that the spirit cries behold i come quickly even so come quickly lord jesus the age the philadelphia church age lasted from 1750 to about 1906. this age due to the meaning of the name of the city has been called the age of brotherly love as philadelphia means love of brethren the messenger the messenger to this age was without doubt john wesley john wesley was born at epworth june 17 1703 and was one of 19 children born to samuel and susannah wesley his father was a chaplain in the church of england but it is more than likely that the religious turn of john's mind was based more upon his mother's exemplary life than upon his father's theology john was a brilliant scholar it was while he was at oxford that he and charles became part of a group who were spiritually exercised to worship on the basis of experientially living the truth rather than making doctrine their standard they drew up a spiritual guide of works such as giving to the poor visiting the sick and the imprisoned for this they were called methodists and other derisive titles now john was sufficiently imbued by his vision of the need of religion for the peoples of the world that he went to america georgia as a missionary amongst the indians on his way there he found that many of the ship's passengers were moravians he was deeply impressed by their meekness peace and courage in all circumstances his labors in georgia in spite of self-denials and hard work was a failure he returned to england crying i went to america to convert the indians but oh who shall convert me back in london he again met the moravians it was peter buller who showed him the way of salvation he was truly born again much to the dismay and evident anger of his brother charles who could not understand how such a spiritual man as john should say he was not formally right with god it was however not long after that charles ii was saved by grace wesley now began to preach the gospel in those pulpits in london to which he formerly had access but soon they turned him out it was at this time that his old friend george whitefield stood him in good stead for he invited john to come and help him preach in the fields where thousands were listening to the word wesley at first was incredulous that he should preach in the open instead of a building but when he saw the throngs and saw the working of the gospel in the power of the spirit he turned wholeheartedly to such preaching the work soon took on such proportions that he began sending out numerous laymen to preach the word this seemed like a parallel to pentecost where the spirit raised up men with power to preach and teach the word almost overnight there was violent opposition to his work but god was with him the workings of the spirit were mightily manifested and often such a spirit of conviction took hold of the people as to take away their strength and they would fall to the ground crying in great distress over their sins wesley was a remarkably strong man he says of himself that he could not remember to have felt lowness of spirits for even a quarter hour since he was born he slept no more than six hours a day arose in time to start preaching at five practically every day of his ministry preached up to four times on a single day so that in a year he would average over 800 sermons he traveled multiple thousands of miles as did his circuit riders who carried the gospel near and far in fact wesley traveled 4 500 miles per year by horse he was a believer in the power of god and he prayed for the sick with great faith and wonderful results many of his meetings saw the manifestation of spiritual gifts wesley was not in favor of organization his associates did have a united society who were a company of men having the form and seeking the power of godliness united in order to pray together to receive the word of exhortation and to watch over one another in love that they may help each other to work out their salvation the only condition of those entering was they should be of those who had a desire to flee from the wrath to come and to be saved from their sins as time went on they worked out a strict set of rules to be used in self-discipline for the good of their souls wesley recognized that after his death the movement could be organized and the spirit of god leave them to dead form he once remarked that he did not fear that the name of methodist would leave the earth but that the spirit might take his flight during his lifetime he could have acquired vast wealth but he did not his favorite saying on the subject of money was get all you can save all you can and give all you can how strange it would be for wesley to come back and see the denomination that bears the name of methodist today they are rich vastly rich but the life and power of john wesley is missing it should also be mentioned that wesley never did desire to build a work upon a denominational or sectarian basis though he was an armenian in his beliefs he did not want to separate himself from brethren on the grounds of doctrine he was a good candidate for james he based his eternal life on faith and works or the living of the life rather than simply accepting a creed or a doctrinal statement john wesley died at the age of 88 having served god as few men would dare to even think they might the salutation [Music] you
