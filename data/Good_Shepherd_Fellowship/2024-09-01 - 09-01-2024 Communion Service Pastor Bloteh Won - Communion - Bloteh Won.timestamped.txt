[30:25] uh two VAR ordinance Moses later after
[30:30] 422 years we established for Israel as a
[30:34] as a commandment as an ordinance but God
[30:38] will come and give Abraham an
[30:40] experience and uh so tonight we will
[30:44] just uh uh encourage you a little bit we
[30:48] just we read what actually I do tonight

[31:06] week
[31:08] amen praise the Lord so uh uh we read
[31:12] this this morning but I just added added
[31:14] it to to this to be able to continue
[31:16] from there who is this um uh Maes
[31:20] deck
[31:22] uh
[31:24] notice after the battle was over
[31:28] MEC or MEC s him s his Victorious child
[31:35] communion think of that part of
[31:40] him now we want to see here in a type
[31:45] here in view the
[31:48] communion after the battle now so
[31:52] brother brandom is bringing that
[31:53] experience as a type and uh uh uh
[31:58] so uh because the two communion symbol
[32:04] is represented in there Abraham gave him
[32:06] Bread and Wine so there the two uh
[32:10] elements the two elements of the
[32:12] communion is India so the type fads and
[32:17] that's the reason why we can bring it
[32:19] also as a type for uh uh Joseph in the
[32:24] prison because there is a bread there is
[32:26] a wine so the two communion element is
[32:30] there so we can be able to hold that
[32:32] also as a type so he's saying here uh
[32:37] uh uh we can see here in type here in
[32:42] view the
[32:44] communion after the battle he gave of
[32:50] himself because the communion is a part
[32:55] of Christ praise the Lord Lord amen you
[33:00] remember right there at the foot washing
[33:03] uh Jesus told uh Simon if I don't wash
[33:07] your food you don't have no path with me
[33:10] so it's uh it's every every scripture
[33:14] every chapter every verse As we sing
[33:16] their song every promise in the book is
[33:18] mine amen so every time we uh uh we
[33:23] apply God's word we are fulfilling the
[33:27] part of Christ amen we are partaking the
[33:29] pride of him he says and after the
[33:31] struggle is over after you have
[33:35] done got yourself WEP out
[33:39] then is when you partake of Christ
[33:44] simple is after you get yourself we out
[33:46] you get yourself out of the way amen
[33:49] after you get yourself out of the way
[33:52] then you partake of Christ become part
[33:55] of this being you get it yeah he say
[33:59] praise the
[34:00] Lord
[34:07] hallelujah he says also yeah in all
[34:10] things the me message all things when we
[34:13] do that we come to the communion in the
[34:17] right way we
[34:19] come to the communion remembering him
[34:23] remembering him our
[34:26] sacrifice we remember remember him our
[34:29] peace we remember him our Purity amen we
[34:36] are not thinking on how much we are
[34:38] clean but we are remembering him our
[34:42] Purity amen we are remembering our uh
[34:49] our cleansing now I was I was listening
[34:52] to message I I really wanted to to bring
[34:54] that quote tonight but you see if you
[34:57] remember brother brandham talks about
[34:59] this uh this farmer that had
[35:02] a that had a uh had some cattles and
[35:06] then uh this this other cath uh this
[35:11] young you know uh uh female animal give
[35:15] birth and uh it turned out that this
[35:18] this uh uh little C that was born you
[35:22] know had a big big rabbit ear and uh you
[35:26] know and and uh you know the Cal was
[35:28] born and very weak and uh you know with
[35:31] a cross eyed and and and brother Brandon
[35:34] dramatized it this way he says the
[35:36] little Cal start worrying you know that
[35:40] uh oh I'm born in this condition and uh
[35:44] uh and and and the master is going
[35:46] to he says my master is going to give me
[35:50] offer sacrifice because it's it's almost
[35:52] like I worth nothing you know I can't
[35:54] walk straight I can you know I can do
[35:57] this right I can do that right and uh
[36:00] and and and and even see look at my shap
[36:03] and look at my head it's so big look at
[36:05] my ears is just flopping up he says if
[36:09] the mama cath could speak to her baby
[36:12] she would says
[36:13] honey don't
[36:16] worry you are you
[36:19] are a
[36:22] firstborn praise the Lord he says she
[36:26] will say to to to her little uh uh baby
[36:29] and says uh uh thank you somebody see me
[36:34] struggling thank you God bless
[36:37] you somebody saw me struggling amen
[36:42] thank you I'm
[36:43] grateful I'm grateful praise the Lord so
[36:47] uh
[36:48] uh she will say uh uh you are a first
[36:53] born at the time of the
[36:56] sacrifice don't worry the the master of
[37:00] uh of the farm is going to
[37:04] take the finest C uh uh uh uh sheep the
[37:09] finest lamb that lamb will have to be
[37:12] examined and that line will be
[37:14] sacrificed for every one of us now so
[37:17] the little animer that is looking at
[37:21] it's inability is looking at his
[37:23] weakness and how ugly and shipless it is
[37:27] not having in mind that there is a
[37:32] perfect lamb that is going to take its
[37:38] place praise the Lord he says the mama
[37:41] will says don't worry honey uh uh you
[37:44] are not the one that is going to be the
[37:46] sacrifice there will be a lamb that will
[37:48] take your
[37:50] place praise the Lord so when we come to

[38:19] malice or hatred or strive but we KN At
[38:23] The Cross by faith

[38:47] condemnation that the enemy might bring
[38:49] to our mind we are we our faith is
[38:51] bringing us past death we are coming to
[38:54] the foot of the cross
[39:01] we come in that condition to the
[39:04] communion in very sincerity not just
[39:08] said I should go because everybody is
[39:10] going no you go there because you are
[39:15] deeply
[39:16] sincere it's between death and life yes
[39:20] sir you go and remember your tradition
[39:25] no more and you you are cleansed from
[39:29] your
[39:30] sins amen that's what we come to do
[39:33] tonight we come uh remembering what he
[39:36] have done for
[39:37] us amen when I was listening to that uh
[39:42] uh I remember you know uh that's where
[39:46] uh uh uh brother B took that statement
[39:49] we remind you all the time that the
[39:51] worshipper is not on
[39:55] examination the little C thought that he
[39:58] will be examined he will be examined but
[40:01] he was not he was not going to go on
[40:03] examination the priests will not even
[40:05] look at him the priest will look at the
[40:08] the the lamb that is given for
[40:11] sacrifice praise the Lord amen the
[40:15] priest will look at the lamb that is
[40:17] given for
[40:20] sacrifice now uh uh uh there there is
[40:24] this scripture over in Hebrew where it
[40:26] says that the worshipper wants
[40:29] P amen now so uh uh uh uh if if you
[40:35] apply to that that's what happen when we
[40:39] accept what he has done for us because
[40:42] you can push
[40:45] yourself
[40:47] amen the wor the worshiper once P it
[40:50] used to be that uh you know you must
[40:53] give this thing up and give it out once
[40:55] no you have to believe what he have done
[40:57] for
[41:00] you praise the
[41:06] Lord he said over in the message
[41:11] Discerning the body of the Lord and we
[41:16] know and and we who called ourself
[41:19] Christians we have no right to take the
[41:22] communion unless we are living above
[41:28] a a reproach of the word
[41:32] amen unless we are living above all the
[41:36] reproaches what we you you look at that
[41:39] is in the sense that uh uh I mean we
[41:42] should
[41:44] not knowing what is
[41:46] wrong you know if we are in one thing or
[41:50] another thought process habit whatever
[41:53] it is and you know that is wrong you
[41:56] must rise above it
[41:59] amen we must Rise Above It praise the
[42:04] lord we have no right the communion is
[42:08] for those who are living right as an
[42:12] example of
[42:15] Christianity we don't take the communion
[42:17] because we belong to this
[42:19] church we just don't take the communion
[42:22] because we baptized in Jesus
[42:25] name praise the Lord
[42:28] because sometimes most of the time they
[42:30] you find the the the the little ones
[42:33] they want to take the they want to see
[42:34] what it is you know I want to be
[42:38] baptized they get baptized they come to
[42:39] the come oh is that
[42:42] all praise the
[42:46] Lord no it's not it's not because we are
[42:49] baptized in Jesus name is a life that we
[42:52] are identified with amen
[43:01] okay I'm going to take this one also he
[43:03] said yet in in in the message seent seed
[43:07] and there a and I will tell you the
[43:08] reason why I I put this one there I had
[43:14] a I had a uh a set of quotes that I
[43:18] already put together but for some reason
[43:20] uh I I just pull a few different ones
[43:24] this
[43:24] evening we believe in feet watching we
[43:29] believe in
[43:31] communion we believe in the second
[43:34] coming of Christ the visible corporate
[43:39] body of the Lord not Spirit but the
[43:44] corporate body of the Lord Jesus coming
[43:48] again in glory we believe in the
[43:53] physical
[43:55] resurrection of the death dead to
[43:58] receive a body not old and wrinkled as
[44:02] we go through the grave but a new one in
[44:08] the very BL of Youth to lay
[44:11] forever we believe in immortality amen
[44:15] do we believe
[44:17] that immortality of the Soul absolutely
[44:20] we
[44:21] believe there's only one form of
[44:24] internal life and that's the life that
[44:29] you get from Christ Jesus that's exactly
[44:34] praise the Lord now why why is is good
[44:38] to remind ourself this is that there are
[44:41] a lot of things that that there there is
[44:45] a spiritual
[44:47] application that uh has been applied to
[44:50] it just like I said many believe that as
[44:54] we Fellowship around the word as we
[44:56] preach the word
[44:57] we are having
[44:59] communion so for them coming to the
[45:02] Lord's table is not
[45:05] important we we we have the word the
[45:08] book is open we must be in the
[45:13] Mysteries we must take the book and
[45:17] eat praise the Lord but you see uh uh uh
[45:22] uh uh it's just like there is no way
[45:27] uh uh we can as much as the water do not
[45:33] take away our sin yet we must be
[45:36] identified with the death buried and
[45:39] resurrection of Jesus Christ by going
[45:41] down in the
[45:42] water praise the Lord what cleanses us
[45:46] we are Washed by the Water of the
[45:49] word so you see our spiritual cleansing
[45:53] comes by the preaching of the word by
[45:55] the hearing of the word by the believing
[45:57] of the word by the applying of the word
[46:00] our spiritual cleansing come but it it
[46:03] it does not stop us from being baptized
[46:07] going down into a physical water and be
[46:12] baptized praise the Lord
[46:16] amen now when we when we when we when we
[46:19] believe the Lord Jesus just like in the
[46:21] Old Testament uh uh uh you know the the
[46:25] the priest come we are priest and Kings
[46:27] unto our God there is there is a there
[46:30] is a uh uh a major bath that they are
[46:33] giv the Bible says they are put in the
[46:35] basing right before the congregation and
[46:38] Moses washed them down but every time
[46:41] they goes to the Tabernacle there is a
[46:43] lava there that they have to wash their
[46:45] feet before they go into the holy
[46:47] Place praise the Lord so you see by the
[46:51] sanctification of the word we get that
[46:54] General washing
[46:57] amen but every time we come to service
[47:00] the holy spirit will pick up something
[47:02] in our life if it is not something that
[47:05] we are doing wrong it's something that
[47:07] we need to do it's something that we
[47:09] need to learn praise the Lord so it's a
[47:14] type of our feet washing what we would
[47:17] do after the
[47:19] service that's the reason why Jesus told
[47:23] Simon I don't need to wash your whole
[47:24] body because he already told them you
[47:27] are cleansed by the word that I have
[47:29] preached unto you so I have already done
[47:33] the entire body washing but now this one
[47:37] is unique to the church you see I mean
[47:40] every service we come we is is is a form
[47:43] of of also you know uh uh uh foot
[47:46] washing but we can't say that oh we
[47:49] having a spiritual foot washing because
[47:51] we are Washed by the word so I mean we
[47:54] don't we don't need uh you know we have
[47:56] passed that
[47:58] that's the Old Testament
[48:01] thing you see what I'm going with that
[48:04] you know you cannot you
[48:08] cannot spiritualize
[48:11] everything there are certain thing that
[48:13] is given to the church as an
[48:17] ordinance praise the Lord for anything
[48:21] to have a spiritual application there's
[48:24] a physical manifestation
[48:28] amen are we
[48:30] together now so that's what he goes on
[48:33] to says here we believe in foot uh feet
[48:36] washing we believe in communion we
[48:38] believe in the second coming of Christ a
[48:41] visible corporate body and that's going
[48:45] to
[48:47] happen we have have we have had a
[48:51] coming which is the revealing of the
[48:53] word but there's going to be a corporate
[48:56] body it will not be on earth it will be
[48:59] in the
[49:01] air sir we don't have a promise of a
[49:05] corporate body on the earth what we have
[49:08] as a promise on the earth is the
[49:10] revealing of the
[49:12] word a Ministry that has that that has
[49:15] been that has been able to manifest
[49:17] Christ to
[49:20] us are we
[49:23] together but you see the the the opening
[49:27] of the word the revealing of the word
[49:29] the revealing of the son of man the
[49:31] opening of the seals let me go back let
[49:33] me say it that way the opening of the
[49:35] seals can can limit some if we says that
[49:39] you know that's the coming of the Lord
[49:41] there is no coming after that you are
[49:43] wrong because here has a quote that says
[49:45] there's a Corporal
[49:48] body I was looking at something we talk
[49:50] about it when we get there brother bam
[49:54] says God gave every age
[49:57] and access to the
[49:59] word in one sense we can say every age
[50:04] have is experience of a
[50:08] coming we get there let me not go ahead
[50:11] of myself that's not what I want to talk
[50:13] about tonight so so uh uh uh uh there
[50:16] there's a there's a visible corporate
[50:18] body of the Lord not in spirit but the
[50:21] Corporal body of the Lord Jesus coming
[50:24] again in glory amen
[50:28] we believe in a physical resurrection of
[50:32] the Dead to receive a new
[50:35] body but are we
[50:38] Quicken have we been quickened yes we
[50:41] have been
[50:43] Quicken yes that's why Paul says in
[50:46] Ephesian you that were dead in sin and H
[50:50] H and trespass have he what
[50:55] Quicken so oh that Quicken means you you
[51:00] you have you have experienced a
[51:03] resurrection because you were dead in
[51:05] sin and trespass when the word come you
[51:08] have been
[51:10] quickened praise the Lord but you see h
[51:14] h h h uh
[51:16] uh God reaching Mercy brother brandham
[51:19] said there he he really said that in in
[51:22] in uh you know and and and in the way he
[51:24] said it he said it in way that we have
[51:27] been resurrected and some make a
[51:29] Doctrine and says there is no
[51:31] Resurrection the resurrection has
[51:32] already taken place because the because
[51:35] the word has quickened us no we have
[51:38] been quickened but there's going to be a
[51:41] resurrection that's why he's saying here
[51:43] there will be a resurrection he says
[51:46] where uh uh uh resurrection of the Dead
[51:49] not this old wrinkle body you see and
[51:52] and and and all of those things were
[51:53] creating uh uh all kind of a scand
[51:57] because people were believing they are
[51:58] in the resurrection and yet they getting
[52:03] sick they are in the resurrection oh we
[52:06] have been resurrected and yet they they
[52:11] die yes we have ex we we have
[52:14] experienced a resurrection we have been
[52:17] quickened from sin to
[52:21] life amen you that were dead in sin and
[52:25] trespass have he Quicken that word
[52:28] Quicken means to make a life if the same
[52:32] spirit that was in Jesus that raised
[52:35] Christ from the dead dwell in you it
[52:38] will do what Quicken your mortal
[52:41] body amen so that quickening power is to
[52:45] bring us above the life of sin it does
[52:49] not means that you will not get sick it
[52:51] does not means that you will not die if
[52:53] you are ordained to die then go by the
[52:55] weight of the Grave it's completely
[52:57] different from this Resurrection a
[52:59] completely different from the
[53:01] Resurrection the first resurrection
[53:03] which is the
[53:08] rapture amen so what am I saying there
[53:12] is a spiritual application the spiritual
[53:15] application do not write off the
[53:23] physical amen
[53:27] and do not ride off the
[53:39] physical in the resurrection of let me
[53:42] let me just go right here I go talk a
[53:44] whole lot of things here and we
[53:47] just and we in the new body he says we
[53:50] believe we believe in U we believe in
[53:55] the immortality
[53:58] of the Soul absolutely I could bring a
[54:01] scripture I could bring a scripture from
[54:04] the book of Timothy where trothy said
[54:07] when Jesus resurrected he brought
[54:10] immortality to light praise the Lord he
[54:15] brought immortality why because when
[54:18] when you receive eternal life Immortal
[54:21] immortality is in
[54:24] you Jesus brought that to light and
[54:28] that's what brother brandham experienced
[54:30] at the behind the curtain of
[54:35] time praise the Lord that's the reason
[54:39] why there is no D door movement in in
[54:42] the in a believer's
[54:44] life
[54:47] amen we don't we don't die then they
[54:49] pack us to the grave and we stay in the
[54:51] cold dirt until the trumpet sign no
[54:55] because because immortality is is is is
[54:59] in plain view when when you drop this
[55:02] body as this body is going down your
[55:04] spirit leaves it and jump in another
[55:09] body there is no door moving in the
[55:11] twinkling of an eye you in a brand new
[55:14] body and I mean you get so much strength
[55:16] you are running across the
[55:18] field praise the Lord while we are here
[55:21] crying for you you are running across
[55:23] the
[55:24] field you are in the Splendor of your
[55:27] Youth and we all oh yeah yeah yeah oh
[55:31] Jesus Oh Lord Oh but you are running
[55:33] across the
[55:40] field praise the
[55:50] lord we believe in the immortality of
[55:53] the Soul it don't sleep in the grave for
[55:57] the special period of time no you step
[56:00] into a new body when this Tabernacle be
[56:02] dissolved there's another one waiting
[56:04] for
[56:05] you praise the
[56:07] Lord
[56:10] hallelujah I mean you are running so
[56:13] fast because at that moment you are
[56:15] traveling as a thought you are going so
[56:20] fast so
[56:23] fast praise the Lord
[56:29] because there is so much thing to catch
[56:30] up
[56:30] [Laughter]
[56:32] to are we to get
[56:34] them we believe there is there's only
[56:37] one form of eternal life and that's the
[56:41] life that you
[56:42] get
[56:44] from Christ Jesus and you are a
[56:48] possessor of it you don't get there
[56:50] before you have it you have a
[56:52] year amen when you accept the Lord Jesus
[56:56] as your savior you believe in him you
[56:58] you're born again you get a
[57:01] year you are a possessor of it praise
[57:04] the
[57:05] Lord that's the thing there that that
[57:08] that checks on you when you are
[57:12] straing praise the lord it's the thing
[57:15] that wakes you up in the middle of the
[57:17] night when you need to make something
[57:22] right because that life cannot stay in
[57:25] can't stay
[57:27] comfortable in the body that is trading
[57:30] from the word that is living in
[57:33] sin no it's it's going to it's going to
[57:36] make you
[57:37] Restless it will make you
[57:40] Restless because it cannot condone those
[57:44] things praise the
[57:47] Lord so if a man is is you know is
[57:50] confessing eternal life and then living
[57:53] in sin and having good sleep you know to
[57:56] check it
[57:57] up praise the Lord because it won't give
[58:01] you good sleep we'll read this one and
[58:02] then we change the order of the service
[58:04] tonight praise the
[58:06] Lord context brother B said this and we
[58:10] just want to read
[58:11] it as we just uh get ready to change the
[58:17] order service he said
[58:19] here he prayed and said father I pray
[58:22] that I might say something that will
[58:25] that will PL ENC courage in the heart of
[58:28] that people praise the Lord so I hope
[58:31] I've said something that have encouraged
[58:33] you tonight amen are you encouraged
[58:36] tonight you feel like pressing
[58:38] on Amen you feel like making Better
[58:43] Effort praise the Lord
[58:47] amen that we could leave here tonight
[58:50] after taking the communion and we
[58:53] realize that in the communion there is
[58:58] strength praise the Lord in the
[59:01] communion there is
[59:07] strength praise the Lord I will leave
[59:10] you tonight we realize that in the
[59:13] communion there is strength Israel took
[59:15] the communion first down in Egypt and
[59:19] walk 40 years without their shoes
[59:22] wearing out or their clothes getting in
[59:27] treid
[59:29] amen you will see that's the reason why
[59:32] both the communion and uh and uh and uh
[59:37] uh and Tiding are are
[59:40] connected because Malachi will says that
[59:44] I will open the windows of heaven and I
[59:46] will bless you and I will rebuke the
[59:50] devorer when your clothes gets old is
[59:53] divor when your shoes gets old is
[59:57] devolved when your car gets old it
[59:59] devolved so it's pretty much the same
[1:00:02] thing if the if the communion sustained
[1:00:06] their clothes it also kept their cattles
[1:00:09] well amen it also kept their donkeys
[1:00:14] strong to carry them for for for 40
[1:00:17] years in the
[1:00:21] wilderness praise the
[1:00:23] Lord so God opening the window of Heaven
[1:00:27] is not to is is you know it's it's I
[1:00:29] mean God can bless us with all the
[1:00:31] newest thing on the Earth but the the
[1:00:34] the promise there is that he's going to
[1:00:37] sustain what you
[1:00:41] have amen he's going to sustain what you
[1:00:48] have so sometimes it's it is it is it is
[1:00:52] the is is the blessing that sustain even
[1:00:55] even our vehicle
[1:01:01] because that such things some things are
[1:01:03] in our home and and and and all of that
[1:01:06] so you see it's it's tied
[1:01:09] together when he rebuked the
[1:01:14] divor then they went 40 years without
[1:01:18] their shoes wearing out and they are
[1:01:21] close and all of that amen
[1:01:26] and walk 40 years without their shoes
[1:01:29] wearing out or their clothes getting
[1:01:31] turbed and out of two million people
[1:01:34] there wasn't a feeble one among them we
[1:01:38] can we can say the Lord has been good to
[1:01:40] us amen praise the lord we might have a
[1:01:43] little headache here a little sneezing
[1:01:45] there but God is keeping this body
[1:01:49] together praise the Lord amen he's
[1:01:52] keeping us he's keeping us by his grace
[1:01:55] praise the Lord
[1:02:05] hallelujah again when I was talking to
[1:02:08] my friend this morning brother VY I told
[1:02:10] him I say I heard I heard through your

[1:10:42] I was trying to bring the thought of how
[1:10:44] eating is not just only physical but the
[1:10:47] things we consume in our mind and if
[1:10:50] there is one thing that the enemy is
[1:10:52] using on us is spending a lot of time on
[1:10:54] the phone
[1:10:55] especially when it's unnecessary things
[1:10:58] and if and if we are caught in that
[1:11:00] habit you must bring it to the Lord you
[1:11:02] must identify it if you are if you are
[1:11:05] just spending countless hours on the
[1:11:08] phone just just looking at unnecessary
[1:11:10] things and uh you could spend countless
[1:11:13] hours listening to something audiobook
[1:11:16] or doing something creative that's
[1:11:18] completely different but if it is just
[1:11:21] countless hours unnecessary things and
[1:11:24] just looking into different people's
[1:11:26] status and looking at this you you what
[1:11:28] you are doing you are consuming those
[1:11:31] things you are eating from a wrong
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:43] place and we need to we need to break
[1:11:47] those
[1:11:49] habits we need to be
[1:11:52] industrious we need to be
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:08] productive father we we we have to call
