in Jesus Christ name we pray amen hallelujah I will see much we turn off turn our feet to read portion the scriptures I we just stand a little bit and just read the book of First John Hallelujah chapter one the portion the word of God Amen first John chapter 1 try to read portion the word of God year amen first John chapter 1 read from verse one there is God's word the Bible said first John chapter one verse one I read that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life for the life were manifested and we have seen it and bear Witnesses and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard and declare unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly if our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and this things right unto you that your joy may be full this then is a message which you have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ C his son cleanses us from our sin and if we say we have no sin we deceive ourself and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is sful and just to forgive us our sin and the cleanse us from all unrighteousness may have blessing to the reading of his word believe seed amen amen now we just read portion the word of God and the light and I brother Danel were talking were giving me a testimony but he don't know it's what I going to preach on the light and he was taking how God convicted he saw that light that came to him Hallelujah and I say why was just a confirmation we going to preach this morning Hallelujah and thinking on the things on the light and the Bible said this is then this the message which you have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is not Darkness at all and if we say we have fellowship with one another and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin Hallelujah so know that God is light and in him there's no Darkness so you cannot have Fellowship Hallelujah to have Fellowship we know how to have fellowship with the light and if God is a light and we walk in darkness it means we have no fellowship with him Hallelujah and that great light we saw that even said in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 1 verse4 Bible say he came in a wild wind and out of the North a great cloud a fire unfolding himself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof was a c of im a light Hallelujah so see say in the midst of fire god is an IM IM call a great light hallelujah amen so you see Ezekiel saw him in the light that in the beginning Genesis he said let there be light and we going to a city in a city where the light is a light Hallelujah because he is that great light and that light there is no darkness in that light hallelujah amen and if you are walking Darkness it means you cannot have fellowship with that light Hallelujah and that what John said J from the beginning him that we have heard which we have heard we have declar unto you Hallelujah and we see John speaking in the Bible which is a p of love when you get in the person of that great light he recognize that light Hallelujah that is God himself because God is from the beginning Hallelujah and now if you look in the word of God so we seeing that in the scriptures when John saying when you're ownmost at the pmos vision he had the experience of that great light Hallelujah and that light is different from the cosmal light is different from what the electric light is different from the sunlight that light is an internal light Hallelujah and in him is love and God is light and light bring Fellowship Hallelujah Light Fellowship with light and darkness fellowship with Darkness Hallelujah you see it Hallelujah the two things are opposite one another and now no man are seen God at any time no man can see God at any time they say only the begning had declared him Hallelujah nobody has seen God because God is a spirit and they that worship him she Worship in spirit and in truth so the only begotten that came from that light had declared him hallelujah oh yes sir so you see so God is light and in him there is no darkness and notice there is nothing in in the space and when when God from the beginning there was nothing existing Hallelujah from the beginning there was there was nothing existing there was only a great supernatural being from the beginning that great Jehovah who cover all space when was speaking on the the C on the the the genes divice he said from the beginning God there were nothing existing but only that great being that were existing that cover all space and cover all times he was Everlasting to Everlasting and here the beginning of the creation Hallelujah and that is God and nothing was existing Hallelujah but he was still existing he was there Hallelujah yet he was God and God be existing Hallelujah because he is what the either Elohim which means self existing one hallelujah amen and the pr God said and after this while he said sit on the B of God he said that great secret light begin to form that Hollow now when God Hallelujah in his mind because in Genesis God created the Heaven and Earth period the Bible never tell the time that God and what create everything say God created the Heaven and Earth period but only tell us the time he begin to use the Earth Hallelujah but when Genesis one in the beginning God created heaven and earth what is milon years St years he never tell anything he said God created a heaven and earth period but with the first he say let there be light because God is light Hallelujah then now God begin to what to form begin to form create the sun to create the moon Hallelujah the banic light but from the beginning God was a self-existent one hallelujah amen so you see a church so you know that that God that great light that God is Elohim which me the the self-existing one then out of that supernatural being Hallelujah came a little light a h of light and the light is called the logos and the logos is the anointing and out of the logos come the son then he spoke let there be light that is why we know in St John 1 verse1 the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the word of God and the Word was God hallelujah and the word will make men and the word dwelt among us hallelujah so you can see that son came from that light that we know Jesus is the light of what the word hallelujah oh yes sir he came from that light amen because man in his mind don't know how God is but God for men for men to get the idea of who that God is which is self-existent one he had to condescend from that light and took a body and stepped onto it then we going to see him to know get the idea of who that God is why he say I come from God I'll go back to God I come from that light I'll go back to that light that is why on the road of Damascus when Paul persecute the Christian and Paul knew who he was Hallelujah who Paul made when Paul saw that great light Hallelujah and the light could blind Paul eyes and Paul spoke to that light who are thou Lord but the voice from that light say I'm Jesus Paul got to know that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament he is that great light hallelujah oh yes sir amen so God to develop and came from that light then come the logos then come the son hallelujah what Jesus said he said Jesus say in the book of St John 17 verse5 what he said he said now oh Father glorify th me he said glorify thou me with thy own self with the glory which I had with thee before the war wars because he come from there to be made manifested Hallelujah that is a mystress that people don't understand that what the Bible said and what without control verses great is the mystery of godliness God the self-existent one was manifested in the flesh God become flesh hallelujah amen and God is the word that was in the beginning was the word and the Word was of God so the word is light that's why the gospel is a light hallelujah oh yes sir he said the glory that how the before the world was he said and I was manifest I manifest that name unto men so what is the name of God he said I have manifest your name manifest manifestation means to make no Hallelujah so you manifesting God to us for which for us to recognize that great light that way he said I have manifested th name unto the men which thou given me out of the word that they were and thou G me gave down me and they have kept the word he said now they have know that all things whatsoever that has given me are there he said I have gave unto them the word which thou GTH me Hallelujah and God is his word and his word is a light that he say I gave them unto the that word because he was the word he was the light hallelujah amen he said I gave you unto them the word which th G me and that they receive them and have no Sur I come out from thee that Genesis he came out of that light so we can have the idea of who that God is I come out of thee Hallelujah that's a manifestation that many people don't Son of God Son of God means god in flesh God be made manifested in our mess and the gospel is God himself and he is that great light that came to be manifested unto us hallelujah and a gospel is a light that shine in in our heart Hallelujah that why he say I come out of thee that that they have believed that thou do send me and I pray for them I pray not for the word but for them which thou has given me for they are done so church is a sign that you cannot come except God call you that you cannot see that light until God call you because the Bible say Darkness upon the Earth Andross Darkness upon the people but arise and Sh for the light has come Hallelujah the light is a gospel because Darkness on the earth gr Darkness upon the people hallelujah but there a light in the end time and at the even time Earth shall be light and we are in the evening time and will be there a home going Hallelujah so why are you standing Hallelujah he said Hallelujah in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God unold himself down to human being hallelujah hallelujah so that great logos that H light come out of him he come out of that H light the son the logos be made manifested that Supernatural God hallelujah oh yes church now when God came when he came out of that light when he stepped down then he spoke the word let there be light the how you to create the word in the beginning was the word and the what was going what was going what made flesh he said without him nothing was made all things was made by him and for him Hallelujah so when he step out of that light that's what Paul was persecuting a Christian because he couldn't understand how can they say because you know Jehovah God is a God who was serving but how can they say Jesus was God but Paul when Paul the revelation on the road Damascus the emper recognize that Jehovah god of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament Hallelujah but take it take a light to open your eyes it take a light for you to see it it take a light for God to to speak to you hallelujah or else your your eyes will be open but you are blind you'll be seen but you are blind Hallelujah because it's God manifest himself to us hallelujah so now when God begin to create the word you are writing what a fresh Bible in a zodak Hallelujah start with a virgin birth and end with the Le the lion L of Christ start with a first coming of Christ and ending with the second coming of Christ hallelujah hallelujah and God to write everything begin to show the whole world Hallelujah when he begin to form this Earth Hallelujah but when he create men men begin a less of God and God gave man domain over everything Authority and power but the enemy has slip in but God have internal purpose and God's purpose in our life can never be defeated hallelujah oh yes sir so you see Church and we are made out of light because God is a light we all that is sitting here we are made out of light we are made out of the cosmo light hallelujah amen that is why when you when when you take Ezra EZ don't have light but it's a light from your body that make the Ezra Hallelujah yes sir it's a light from your body that make the E and the prayer God t that hallelujah amen and say we are born with full RS of light he said at 25 years one R go out at 35 years another R go out I fed why see what me then found on the last R Hallelujah as we pass 65 we are living on a lastar bre of light that is in our body that is a reason you why why he say and that's what you know that the Ezra when you taking Ezra is a light that keep coming out of your body now you don't take that frequently that Hallelujah because a light that your light from your body that produce e Hallelujah he said that's a cosmo light that is in you that you are made out of you are full of light light cells there are cells in your body that are full of light Hallelujah but God is a Different Light hallelujah oh yes sir yet is a light and now take note a proof that is why God come with s the the H picture the pill of fire that came down now God is always manifested in light hallelujah amen and and God light he operated through that light of God operate through the cosmo light Hallelujah to shine us so it's God light operate through the cosmal light to lighten us and now Church to know actually who that light is to catch a revelation that what God Said in Romans 10 verse3 he said for whatsoever for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be be saved it said but how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they heard without a preacher so God always you me to the age to declare who God is and that is why John said in what first John H Hallelujah this is the witness Hallelujah and he was saying the in first John and this is the message that we heard from him from the beginning and I declare unto you that God is light Hallelujah so it take a preacher to declare Hallelujah he said for who Lord shall be saved but how can they call in home the have not believed how can you call to God if you don't know actually who that God is how can you come to him how can you approach him you can read the Bible Hallelujah because anyone educated can turn a picture of the scriptures but it take God to open our eyes of understanding that is why that ethopian Enoch that were driving out he are read aah he couldn't understand but the Holy Ghost how to take Philip to say why you really understand that he said how can they hear how can they believe I a preacher speaking to them and our God using men hallelujah oh yes sir to speak this word to you Hallelujah and he said how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him in whom they have not heard and how shall they heard without a preacher he said what and how shall they preach except they be S so unless God sends you then God back the ministry if God send you man will take it of you but when God send you God take care of you Hallelujah so God will s a preacher that will come without compromising Hallelujah that will preach the power of God to the people and and tell them Hallelujah that this is a light that this is the way walk ye in it hallelujah oh yes sir it said how can it preach except to be S for it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring good THS of good things Isaiah said Lord he said what Who Shall Believe our report now say how can believe report unto whom the arm of God is reveiled you cannot believe this report until God open your eyes of understanding because you should know God for yourself if you know God for yourself in the power of the resurrection and if you accept that light then you not allow Darkness to enter your life you don't do things contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because if you receive that light it has to shant to you to others and your life to be an example to others hallelujah oh yes sir so fake I'm by hearing and hearing by the word say God to open your eyes that what the gospel like I will sing this song in the light the Gospel Light Let It Shine from sure to sure they sh everywhere Hallelujah and God always used men from Genesis men become the instrument that God been using men we saw in Israel when he were in on a bondage in Egypt God S A deliverer he had to send Moses Hallelujah to care the word of God but when God Called Moses when God sent a man God don't say behind Hallelujah so when God Called Moses when Moses met the burning bush it was a light he met that light the Bush on consumption and God in the light is in a fire Hallelujah and M recognized but God said go to St let my people go and when MOS are going that light step into Moses hallelujah oh yes sir and was God going but God always work you men true human being hallelujah oh yes sir the prayer of God say he send an angel and speak the and and speak to the voice of a man he said God always use men for his work he doesn't use organization and so forth he doesn't use machinical device Hallelujah but he used men the Holy Ghost fall upon men on the day of Pentecost it came fire from heaven he anoint them to C the fire of God out and church Let the Fire of God burn in you let the fire of God cat in your life then you'll stop all the fusing and all the confusion and all the tension and all this argument Hallelujah but when you're on fire church your mind change your character change your behavior change your way of think can change if on fire of God hallelujah fire god burn it burn everything out of your life it make you transform hallelujah oh church if you has an experience of the Holy Ghost that why the Holy Ghost is a fire it's a light Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is a fire the Holy Ghost is a light that burn every out our life but you know the reason because men love Darkness Hallelujah he say long you love Darkness you can never have fellowship with that light hallelujah oh yes sir so you see church that is the word of God he say message why he said and God got the Holy Ghost tonight for every believer he got the Holy Ghost today for every believer that want to receive it we have God the anointed preacher in the land that preaches daily and night but if the people it said but it is the people who stubborn ways that they love Darkness better than light it's a people own stubborn ways the word of God is Not intellectual conception the word of God is a revelation Hallelujah there are own stubborn ways they love Darkness than light Hallelujah they rather live in this world than to walk in the Gospel Light Hallelujah people you don't know what a pleasure it is to walk in the light in the light of Jesus Christ and have fellowship with him is a glorious Divine to fellowship with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because the Holy Ghost is a light so if you have the Holy Ghost your light will shine in your community your light will shine in your marriages your light will shine in your homes it will shine everywhere it will Evol question mark hallelujah oh yes sir it was shine in the church oh yes sir this light this glorious light I put not recognize some we are playing Church some we are joking it's not how long you be in the message but it's how long this light is in you it's how long you profess to be a Christian but it's your light Shin everywhere Hallelujah it is shining your home can you wife have confident in you can the husband have confident in the wife can the children have confident in the parents can we be example to them hallelujah oh yes sir but what are we doing with a glorious light but the prayer of God say men love Darkness Hallelujah they love Darkness rather than the light the light have come hallelujah oh yes sir he said we are ch and if we are born again we are children of the day the children of the world walk in darkness they walk at night time they love Darkness but the Bible said men love people love Darkness more than they do the light because the light always manifest their deeds you know a light bring manifestation hallelujah oh yes sir when you off the light everything go in darkness but the light reveals the light make no it bring the truth out Bible said if we are liar we cannot have fellowship with the light oh yes sir church this light we F to realize how powerful is it but it's very powerful hallelujah amen he said take note let the sun come up every lasard every book every inent of Darkness with every cow of night Hallelujah they will take onor something begin to H sometime you in a kitchen and a croes all over but you put on the light they all to away and church if that gospel the power of God is a light and if darkness in your heart and that go will shine it will break everything apart it will take any hypocrisy way it will strengthen you because God is light hallelujah oh yes sir and might be will to receive that light it will take every hypocrisy away it will take every hatred away it will take every stra away that life will expose Hallelujah we take every malice every Envy every stri from our heart Oh yes any confusion Spirit it will take out our life it will make her be sincere it will make her to say I'm sorry oh say forgive me that doesn't mean this way have mercy upon me hallelujah oh yes sir church that light Hallelujah when he shine he said that's the same way with the gospel light when it begin to shine every evil deeds will craw on something Hallelujah we got the light because we are in the night time but if we walk in the light at night time we walk we at night time we walk on at the future light but all the light we see they are all at the future light Hallelujah this light but the real the the Sun that shine but the most powerful light is the sun of God hallelujah and only true Christian light that is the light of the Son of God he is the only true light he say Jesus the light of the world and in him because where there is light there is life take the son to bring Botanical what life on the earth Hallelujah so they take the Son of God to bring him on light Resurrection eternal life in your heart oh yes sir church that is B say You must be born again oh yes oh yes soone see people argue people say their own thing you wonder if they are seeing the light I don't care how you feel I don't care how you think you wonder if they see the light because when you see the light it will change your perception on things it will make you have forgiving Spirit it make you don't hold on things that will not benefit you it will make you die to yourself and die to your thinking oh yes you know church this light the gospel is coming sometime when the word coming for the light is scattered Darkness but sometimes when come forth instead of us taking it on ourself some cast on somebody let hear it he talking to him oh he talking to her oh he talking to that person but no it's to you Hallelujah you might AC in your own life and said God give me Grace Lord help me and transform my life Hallelujah the Gospel Light is still shining is still burning hallelujah oh yes sir and that is what the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 4:3 the Bible said but if our gospel be H it is H to them that are lost if the gospel is hate is hate from those who are lost Hallelujah it in whom the God of this word have blinded their minds of them which believe not he said L the light of the gospel of Christ who is in the image of God should shine upon them so if the gospel if you cannot see if you cannot see this light then you are blind and light do two things light either blind you or show you the way if you come against the light it will blind you hallelujah oh yes sir when when we saw Paul we saw when he come against that light on Ro Damascus the light took him down blind him hallelujah oh yes sir but when you receive the light and you are waiting the light show you the path that is why don't fight against this light with your thought Hallelujah don't fight against this light take this light it will help you walk in the light what say your word is a lamp to my path it's a light to my ways Hallelujah he say least the light of the glor gospel of Christ who is in the image of God should shine hallelujah amen you shine to them for we preach not ourself but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourself your servant for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shine in our heart to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of the god in the face of Jesus Christ and the light what it bring knowledge the light bring understanding the light gave Revelation the light open your eyes Hallelujah this light is a glor gospel church amen I son say we walk in the light say shine all around us Day by night Jesus the light of the world Amen so the the light it lighten your knowledge the light open your understanding the light change your direction the light make you see very clear if darkness is here if you walking you you thinking if you hear something Hallelujah but it's a light you walk freely oh yes sir it make you walk freely so church that's why because we have a message we have a evening light hallelujah oh yes sir and that is what a believer who walk freely we don't we are not scared we're not afraid of what we believe Hallelujah because this light we know his truth hallelujah that when Li say under no circumstances a Believer should unbeliever the light will guard you if they see light will tell you unto death do aart the lad said it you walk in that light you are now argue with the light hallelujah oh yes it's a light when you when you when you do anything you will go against that light hallelujah oh yeah it's a double a sword is hard but the light will expose sin the light will expose darkness when the light says for better for worse you know I don't know when people don't understand why God said that Hallelujah for better for worse it means that in marriage we have our worst time hallelujah it's not for better for stay for worse for go no Hallelujah the light in must said for better for stay for worse for go no hallelujah oh yes and when a preacher is blessing us you see your smile we laugh they cheer but after everything over they fulfill the word they fulfill our vow let tell God we are sincere we me and me what we say hallelujah oh yes oh yes I said in in of Good Times and in bad times because the whole Christian walk is a bump path but say it's not an easy Road Hallelujah but Jesus liting the journey Jesus liting a path he gu us but it's not an easy path Church hallelujah oh yes sir because now we are seeing the enemy is attacking the enemy fighting and one of the thing Enemy Fight is marriage if you don't know because that will take many souls to hell so you attack marriage because he saying his word there's no adultery adulterous with see the of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's the word of God So when you say I don't want woman you get married adultery how you see Christ face the light you know I want to pray God said God don't joke with his words and God don't joke with words anything God says he mean it God would not change anything because of you he will now load the stand up because of me why in said Paul say should I preach and be outcast because many preachers will be in Hell hallelujah oh yes sir amen so the enemy F that he attack home he attack family but keep the light burning keep the fire burning hallelujah amen in St John 3:8 Hallelujah he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth is said he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already and why Jesus he is the word now he said blessed are those who are not offended in me offended in the word sometime you see people Believers in church after service they don't shake one another to say God bless you Sister God bless you because they have things in their heart the hi it's hypocrisy Hallelujah yes sir they seconden hi hi no R said bring down all F your handshake Hallelujah hi hi church we are believers Hallelujah he said he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he had not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is a condemnation that the light has come into the world but man love Darkness rather than light because his deeds were what evil Hallelujah and this is evil his heart is evil so you tell in the light we don't get time I tell you church this message is not free I say arise and shine for the light has come Hallelujah because the word is so evil the word is polluted the word is no more sincerity and church it shouldn't be among us you know step people in marriage I said if that if the person with doubt should be the opposite partner it shouldn't be me if I marry my wife no matter circumstances I should say St my conviction it should be me I S me looking the next person I should stay with a conviction if I believe I said this why I'm staying if anything should come it shouldn't come from me if

God we are slacking as Christian we are not sincere Hallelujah we talking with the light Hallelujah the light should shine in our life because the light bring Fellowship you know church if you have the light in you you Fellowship one another you'll see husband fellowshipping with wife when there's no light there's no Fellowship hallelujah oh yes sir light bring Fellowship what the Bible says
