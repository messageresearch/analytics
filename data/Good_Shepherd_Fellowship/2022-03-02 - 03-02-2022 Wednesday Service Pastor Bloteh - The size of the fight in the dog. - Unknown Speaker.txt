brother charlie cox from north carolina to visit with us also this weekend should be our uh the first weekend in uh in the month uh sunday should be a convenient service for us but something we want to do on sunday morning which of course we will we will talk a little bit on that uh we want to put in place a deacon that will work alongside with brother ben and uh and also appreciate the service of brother steve john bibi and uh but we will talk a little more on that we all know uh stephen john b b servers as uh as one of our deacons here and because of uh uh his uh his wisdom i think brother ben treated him as uh the edda on the deacon ball so we we appreciate our brother and we know that uh sister mimi went to be with the lord in december and uh by the scripture we must be able to have another deacon in place that will work alongside with brother ben so i say that so we can all prayed about it because uh this weekend we will we will place our brother dan before the church and have

tonight to the book of deuteronomy verse 31 chapter 31 chapter 31 i was i was i had a thought on mine on my heart uh at home uh in our our our home bible reading we're reading from the book of testimony and and uh there's a verse there there that just pick up something to my heart and uh and that's what i wanted to speak on tonight but uh uh i was i was just meditating on it listening to a message on my way home uh from the office and then uh something dropped from my heart and i said well okay i will i will just follow the lord and see what he want us to do so let's read uh deuteronomy chapter 10 1 tonight let's read from verse 1. and moses went and and and speak these words unto all israel and he said unto them ah i am 120 years old this day was that his birthday oh i'm a 120 years old now okay let me not create any kind of a thing here before you say i'm safe that was moses birthday amen i can no more go out and come in also the lord have said unto me thou shalt not go over this jordan praise the lord so moses is saying it is not only because i'm weak but because god has also said that you will not be able to go over jordan the lord thy god will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord have said praise the lord let's pray together and we'll continue to read father we want to thank you for the portion of your word that we have read and we we just want to ask blessings now father give us inspiration for the night come out of the pages of your word speak words of life to your children lord something that will bring strength internal value and something that will bring us closer to the cross we love you tonight we appreciate you father in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seed we will continue to read from there and uh we all know what is what is happening around the world and uh uh [Music] we just we just believe that uh god is in control amen god is in control and he will he will fight for his people praise the lord amen but uh humanly speaking when you when you just you you're listening to the news and you see everything that is happening you ask what a word that we are living in you know what a word that we are living in the word is filling you know the word the word uh uh uh not that is is feeling it has already failed you know it's it's falling apart like brother branham said and it's to the bottom of faith praise the lord you would think that uh what happened to the jews on a hitler uh if if something like this is happening uh the nations of the world will jump on it right away and say never again praise the lord but you see with the united nations they fly in plains they go and sit down they put a bottle of water before them they go in lazier's hotel eat the best food with with earphones in their ears they sit there you know uh uh playing uh video games on their phone and and it says they are making decisions for the world praise the lord the prophet of god says our lives are in the hands of cruel men praise the lord they are in the hands of cruel men i only told you from your political party but we have a kingdom that is coming amen and that's the one i want to i want to cast my life in as a vote for now for anyone yet on earth praise the lord and uh and all of that so i mean with everything that is that is that is just going on it's just hard for you to kind of push things back from your mind so tonight i would just uh i would just want to take sides with the word of god and uh and just be able to uh you know express my thoughts a little bit so i took i took uh a little thing from a familiar story that brother branham spoke about with uh the emblem on the stadium you know it's not the size of the dog you know but it's the size of the fight that is in the dog that's what i want to speak on tonight the size of the fight that is in the dark it's not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight that is in the dark praise the lord amen and uh [Music] praise the lord and now so we continue to read here we read verse 3 there verse 4 and the lord shall do unto them as he did unto sheehan and to us king of the amorites and unto the land of of them whom he destroyed and the lord shall give them up before your face that yea may do unto them a calling unto all the commandments which i have commanded you be strong and offer good courage now if you if you go back in and then you you do uh bible search on courage you will realize that every time from the first time that courage was used in the bible every time it was used it took a little it took a little change over in the new testament but every time it was used in the old testament it was always having courage to stand for the land that god gave them or for the people praise the lord every time that god told them have a good courage or be courageous it was it was uh it was always for the land it was always in the sense that it was always for his promises yes amen praise the lord amen now because you you have to realize that uh uh uh uh if if god made a promise his promise cannot fail praise the lord but in one sense how he's going to bring his promise to pass the entirety of how he would do it he never told us praise the lord so to believe that god's word will come to pass you have to be courageous why because your faith will be put to the test praise the lord now you we have to realize is we we are not the one that is fulfilling god's word it's god that fulfill his word praise the lord is god that fulfilled his word so for for for you to uh for us to be in a place and wait for their fulfillment because you see one thing that the fall gave us the fall give us a nature of being anxious it's a falling nature to be anxious we want it now we want to see it happening now praise the lord but every time you look through the scripture that i i i kind of looked through it and uh you know just read a few a few of them and it just kind of caught my attention and says oh wow what beautiful you know uh uh the way that god you know you know uh a sense this bible that we have in our hands is divinely designed praise the lord this is not only the word of god but is the living word of god praise the lord i can i can i can be able to take you on a sequence of things through the scripture it will blow your mind you know it will it will it will blow your mind you you look at you look at take for example you look at the uh even uh uh in the new testament you look at the four books for uh uh uh record full full testimony of the ministry of jesus christ you will realize that each of those writers there is one specific word that they choose to use amen like like you look for uh local mark mark used he used this word most of the straight way you'll find the word straightway he used that a lot in the book of mack straightway and there is there is uh there is uh and and and in the way that they use it each one of the gospel they have a unique word that they use in a sequence of seven in a sequence of seven and then and that's and that's uh and that's the way god designed his word that's the way he designed it you'll realize that you have read a scripture and uh and and and before and all the time like like what i had on my mind to preach how much time do i have you okay what i had on my mind to speak on i was actually going to talk tonight on making your election your call and your election show amen you know i was that's that's what i was going to speak on tonight and uh because i realized that uh uh the language that the holy spirit speaks sometimes is misunderstood because we think the holy spirit is speaking english no but the holy spirit is speaking what the spirit is saying to the church the bible say he that have ears must hear what the spirit is saying to the church now because of how the apostle paul peter said that's peter that said that he says making your call in your election show it put our mind in a place when you say when you say make these things to happen it puts your mind in a place that you have to do something so many of the times we think that making our call and our election show is something that we have to do sure and then legalizing also tie it down to works you have to make sure you are doing this you have to make sure you are doing this but uh uh first testimony in chapter one first testilum chapter 1. praise the lord thessalonians 1. love the lord tonight hello he's so good he's so good he's so wonderful now first testosterone in chapter one let's let's look at that if i believe is verse 4 if if if i do believe that is verse 4 first esther ruling chapter 1 verse 4 verse 4 says knowing brethren's beloved your election of god let's go back to verse 3 remembering without seizing your work paul's talking to the to the the brothers there now in tests uh testilonica remembering without seizing your works of faith and your labor of love and the passion of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father norim brethren's beloved your election of god amen so that's where my thought for some reason i just got caught on that ignoring your election ignoring your election now that's the same language that peter is using when he says make your election your calling and your election not make it as if to say you are doing it but no who call you who is he that called you when were you called when is it when you started coming to church or you believe the message ignoring your election it's not your election is not every four years no don't start now amen praise the lord don't stop now your election is not every four years ignoring your election ignoring your election of god praise the lord if the lord gave us the grace we will talk on that and i just i just kept thinking about it all through the week you're just just on my mind just just appreciating the holy spirit ministering you know because if you know who called you when you were called how you were called where you were called and onto what you are called praise the lord okay let's talk about the size of the fight in the dog that's what we want to deal with tonight amen we want to talk about the size of the fight in the dark you know what i've just i just that thought just dropped on my heart and i just i just said well you know i will i will stand with the ukrainian people using that coat tonight to preach it's not the size of the dog but it's the size of the fight that is in the dog amen praise the lord amen we don't preach politics but we preach what is true amen we preach what is true if we preach what is right so you realize here that god is giving you know uh uh uh moses yet is commanding the people and yeah he goes and and you realize this is almost about uh five five times that moses said this you know he keep talking about be courageous amen be courageous because you see you see courage courage is uh it's a wonderful thing what i was telling a little bit i was looking at some some some wonderful quotes on courage someone said being deeply loved by someone gave you strength to know that you are loved by someone it gives you strength why loving someone deeply gives you courage praise the lord sausage is not finer josh hill said this winston churchill he said success is not final failure is not filter it is the courage to continue that count amen any time when people think that they are successful they relax and then the next morning they realize they wake up and realize that they have gone short of their sources then they start again so success is not fun need of failure is filtered what count is the courage to keep fighting praise the lord now because uh uh i mean uh israel was there they were just they were just a group a few people you know group of people we've just imagine these people are coming from on the hands of the egyptian they don't have no no military strength no military tactics and god promised them that they are going to take over yes they are going to take over the land praise the lord they are going to capture the land before jordan and the one after jordan they are going to overcome all these army now just looking at your ability and knowing that these nations are established nations the afghan kings and you're there i mean y'all don't have kings there is one man there with thou said the law that moses and there is other people in this in the very same camp that is fussing they are gossiping they are claiming how to the true moses you are already you already don't have an organized nation you don't have cabinet you don't have soldiers and here you're fussy gossiping who he think he is praise the lord now so if if you look if you look at your ability and look at the promises that is giving it takes one thing to keep dragging you to that promise it takes courage praise the lord it takes courage and i believe that's that's what it it it took for the ukraine people praise civilians lord saw one of the news captions where they lay down before the army tanker say you have to roll over our body if you will enter the city courage that's what it takes praise the lord that's what it takes people amen that's what it takes to stand for god in an evil age like this it take courage it it does not take popu popular opinion not now that not a majority vote of all the people things or what the people say and that's the thing that is they're slashing people you know left and right out of the message they never i mean they never god the word never got a hold of them anyway praise the lord because he said i mean if all of these people are saying this wish me it must be truth which means you don't have a revelation you don't have a birth amen this thing that we are fighting for that we are standing is family value amen it's family value kingdom principle so god moses is telling the people here you know he said this day i'm 120 years old this day and i can i can normally go out and come in my strength is not like before praise the lord amen moses moses acknowledging that all that he was doing it was because of the grace of god that was upon his life now he's telling them my strength is not like before and moreover the word of the lord i will not be able to go over jordan praise the lord amen but there is one thing i want to put in your hands courage moses said it's the only thing i have to give you because i'm certain that god that made the promise would not fail god will not fail on his word so the only thing i can place in your hands tonight is courage praise the lord if you are courageous you will see the body change if you are courageous you will see the rapture amen if you are courageous you will see and experience the move of god but if you just sit there and say let me sit and see you know that many people let me let me sit and see we will see if you want to see we say come and see oh praise the lord tonight amen glory be to god let me just read a little bit of that story that we all are familiar with and i mean if you know it when when things like this uh uh happening in the world you know we we we you know look for scriptures we look for cults and and uh you know to kind of frame our standing our understanding you know uh and you know and and and sometimes people will make uh you know some conclusive statement and uh i never never turned to be like that don't tell uh maybe unless the lord gave me one praise lord because uh you know god's ways are past falling out you know his ways are past fanning out his wonders to perform praise the lord change that's what we need tonight we need courage praise the lord we need courage to stand up to our fear we need courage to stand up to our sickness whatever we are dealing with in our life you have to stand up to it praise the lord because you see god gave these people the promise and tore abraham your sea was so drawn into a strange land but i would bring them out with a mighty hand that's god's word he says i will bring them out with a mighty hand praise the lord but you see in a way that the hand of the lord will be revealed in the life of the people god never told him now you see a person can take a literal understanding and say god says he will bring them out with a mighty hand a hand will stretch down from heaven and just hold us and chunk us over and just pick us up and chunk that was not what god made praise the lord the arm of the law was going to be revealed in his people his strength was going to be make known in their weaknesses they were going to experience his mercy they were going to experience his anger his forgiveness that was the arm of the lord just like the prophet isaiah said who has believed our report and unto whom is the arm of the lord reveal it's only the ones that have believed the ones that have courage to take god at his word i don't know how it's going to happen but i know who promised it i don't know how he's going to bring it to pass but i know who said it and all i can ask lord gave me grace give me courage that when i fall and i fail i can get up and keep striving praise the lord amen verb talk she had in the message god come commissioning moses the prophet he says what you got in your hand that was the question god asked mostly he said a stick wasn't very much but it was a stake well you might not have very much in your hands tonight praise the lord amen now just like we are reading this scene of the people going to their inheritance that's how we must also imagine what is playing on the political stage just like i said on on on sunday it's a political disturbance and every political disturbance is a trumpet to israel right amen god will allow political unrest to push his people back to their homeland are we together amen and just and just and just in the same line where god will allow political disturbance now you see the thing about it there is that those those people you can can you imagine and uh uh uh you know in in in your mind i was i was uh reading some time ago and how uh the jews because of all the different things that were happening with them you know right from the time word they say let his blood be on us and all the different things the jews they try to disguise themselves they try to to change their nationality try to look for a different name and try you know and and all of that but in every way that they try to hide themselves god will allow something to happen praise the lord amen now think let's let's take for example the maybe a little family here they choose uh uh uh uh to to change their name and find a different tribe and and and you know and they settle down and pretty soon god starts blessing them amen and and and when god stop blessing them and start prospering them then what happened there is the other uh a draw a spirit of jealousy because you know it was just say that sent them to bondage so a draw a spirit of jealousy and then the people around them well why their family keep prospering where they came from where descent is from what is their tribe then they start looking in their history and start tracing and they realize that they are not from this place praise the lord then it's just time for jacob to pick up his bag and leave again then he gets to this other place they change their name again because you see there's a promise that is hovering over them and god promised to bless them to bless the things that were put in their hands and as soon as god start blessing them then jealousy it attracts jealousy because it was jealousy that took them out of their homeland it would take jealousy to send them back home god will make the nations around the family around them to be jealous of them persecute them for them to go right back home praise the lord oh my why do god we self what a god we self what's your goal in your hands you said a steak wasn't very much estate well you might not have very much in your hands tonight you say well brother branham i can't even whistle let alone testify well brother you can do something whatever is in your hand get going praise the lord we are at the roar we are at the end of the road brother let's get out here tomorrow let's testify to somebody let's do something about something don't stand still you say well i have been a timid person moses said the same thing just remind me one time uh over a football stadium i was preaching him i walked in and he said a little sign up over there said is not the size of the dog in the fight is the size of the fight in the dark praise the lord you see that's what the holy spirit brings to the believer it brings fighting muscles it gives you an inner fight something in you that just hit this word it hits sin it hits every evil you don't have the physical power to stop it but something you know uh uh uh like better brahman says a righteous indignation rise in you and there are things of yourself you just get tired with and say lord i'm tired with this thing praise the lord you know when you fail it's when you lose your fighting spirit when you lose the will to fight that's when you fail but a man that fight dying die a hero oh praise the lord all of these uh get rich overnight and prosperity gospel you know i have just put the people robbed them of their fighting spirit praise the lord amen erupt them of their fighting spirit it just put them on on a gambling wheel or the thing they can just cash in some money and the money will spin and tomorrow they will get rich praise the lord the churches have just turned to casino sure well they can bet we'll get the highest money we'll give the highest one we'll get the highest in a sense that when i bet more i will get more erupt them of the inner ability erupt them of courage to stain for conviction praise the lord amen that brings to mind another thing but time will not allow me to go into it praise the lord because that's what the church is lost in conviction you have people that don't have a conviction they don't know why they believe what they believe they're just hoping that one day they will find out it's not the size of the dog in the fight is the size of the fight in the dark praise the lord and i believe that's that's that's the thing that is that is that is that is tormenting the mind of that russian detector because all the thought was they were just they would just drive their armor tents and just put up their flags and these people said not this time over my dear buddy i'd rather be a dead man praise the lord is that fighting spirit the last day christians have lost that if we don't have a fighting spirit we complain we complain we try to we we try to look uh uh you know uh uh uh uh uh create some saying of paycheck for people to feel sorry for us when when the apostle paul told us that uh uh uh the weapons of our warfare were not conan he told us we are fighting against principalities power spiritual weakness in high places how can you be fighting and don't have a fighting spirit and don't have nothing in you to fight then you are not fighting you are just a spectator and that's why you can sit there and just criticize this one criticize that one criticize everybody because you're not fighting praise the lord the guy in the stands he knows how to play the game best he sits in the stands and says oh my goodness your life kingdom but it's the man that is in the arena praise the lord if it was me this is what i would do just take the a from there and get doing it if i was the one this is what i would do saints that's just what we need for this age this age that is oppressed with demon power demon spirit hovering over the age all you need is a fighting spirit because you have a promise that when the weakest child of god crawl on their knees and get down and cry to god heaven years all you need is just the courage to get on your knees all you need is the courage to take the name of jesus on your lap that's all you need just the courage right to say lord jesus i need you i need you hmm so that's a good idea you may not be so very big but a lot of fight about you you got to get into it you got to get into it you got to get into the worship get into the world don't say this okay let me see where he's going now get into the world walk in the light and move we unfold because the light is sent to brighten your path bubble says anything i hate to see is a spineless person called himself a christian mind god wants somebody with a grade in the backbone he says i like all body robbers and said lord give me the backbone the size of a sore log put plenty of knowledge in the gable ends of my soul and let me fight the devil as long as i got one tote and then i will gum him so wish me if he if he knocks all my one thought i'm going to gum him till i die let me let me die fighting that fighting spirit people have ever done anything for god in humanity it took courage it took courage for nelson mandela to cry against apartheid they didn't care what it would cost him how many years in prison but it's the fighting spirit that's right people want to fight they don't even know what to fight for right you have to be fighting for principle there's a little thing happening people jump on the street they want to riot what are they fighting for right what are they writing about what is the fighting spirit that is in them it's just to break into people's property right and loot that's that's not fighting and that's why the word is watching i believe that god in his in his in his sovereign knowledge allow it to be like that in church those people have a heritage with god praise the lord and in all of israel battle whether it was just what it was just a jewish boy that was discriminated against that same pillar of fire that led their father in the wilderness i've always been there with them praise the lord you see that's that's that's what it is when that window when uh when a young man and a young woman take to the word of god and says i believe that this is the word of god for this day every every promise every blessing the pill of fire that that the hangover brother branham had in eastern it is not it it's not gone right that uh that we only just need the photo no it's even it's even with the believer today the photo is just an is just an oddworld witness brother branham says it's just a testimony to signs is testifying to science by their own mechanism they were able to capture the supernatural that's all it is is just a witness but when he said i will never leave you i will never forsake you what was he talking about that same pillow of fire will go with you wherever you go [Music] so when you take courage to stand for what is right even though sometimes it's hard praise the lord well you have to realize that it's not you right it's what you are believing is right because if you look at yourself and then you keep feeling you you would you would take your failure for the failure of the truth the truth never fails praise the lord but you were born a failure and if god doesn't help us we would die a failure so people take their own failure to say the message is not true no it's your failure you are the one that have failed to believe god you have failed to be courageous you have failed with your fight you're taking your fight on the wrong side of the camp praise the lord since i would gum him till i die and he did that that's right i like that he got down in the corn field and he said lord if you don't give me the baptism of the holy ghost when you come back to earth you're going to fight you're going to find a part of bones lying right here all he was doing was just being courageous that lord i believe your word brother branham said he has such an anger the thing that make him to make that statement he has such an anger until he got angry and bit his own hearse right he realized no lord you got to take this thing from me he stand up to himself and say lord you got to take this thing for me i need the holy ghost yes that's all you need young people you just need the courage to pick up your bible and read the courage to just be able to set a time aside slip away and get on your knees and say god yes that's all you need just courage and that's what god is witnessing once again to the entire world once again praise the lord once again i mean we can sit here and and feel sorry for oh my god who am i it's not going to help them it's not going to help them right praise the lord it just shows what a feeling word we are in you can trust the word system you have to build your hopes on things in tanner you have to build your hopes on things intended praise the lord we know the story and my little david this guy that i would like to talk about that story one of these days brother mack's little son samuel that's his favorite story when he takes david and goliath man you just you just just get into his word just get into samuel's mind and see david and goliath praise the lord but all david had was just courage it was just courage praise the lord it was just courage to go fight a military uh uh a general with stones it was just courage let's not uh you know we can put all the supernatural thing five stone j-e-s-u-s fire stone f-r-t and david did not know none of that and david took j-e-s-u-s it's wonderful i'm not speaking against it it's good for you david did not know that all all david knew is that how can i sit down here i should be a dead man to see somebody mocking god i should be a dead man that's that's why he made for an uncircumcised philistine to challenge the army of the living god that's all he had courage young people that's that all it takes it does not take no in the seventh seal the seven mystery and all of these things that they are beautiful they will come yes as you as you hold on to your courage they will open to your understanding and you will enjoy it if you hold to your courage to do right live right don't save god because you play music or serve god because uh your parents are coming and what what if it is yourself what are you going to do is having the courage once again in simplicity god explained deuteronomy chapter 31 before our eyes the people hearing the voice of moses echoing in their subconscious be courageous just be strong and be courageous that's the voices that is that is growing out of out of the you know the breaks wall all they are hearing in their ear is be courageous and that's all we need it's just to be courageous have to sit there and complain oh nobody oh yeah you know what yes you know and we just complain and we just why me why me why not you if we would just realize that's where my that's where my burden is i believe that's where the the holy spirit was dealing with me on that uh during your election ignoring your calling you see all out of this why this is we re make your call in the election all are we looking for is is what is my calling why am i called to do when that's not even what the scripture is referring to i mean scripture is just referring to you being called as a son of god as a daughter of god because jesus says my sheep will hear my voice well you see we have this this whole thing in our head we want to do something when all we we are called is children come unto me children come unto me come in love love the father get in the relationship and we hammer this thing down down the head of the people you have to make your call in your election show you have to make your call in your election show what am i called to do whatever you are called to do god place it in your nature the day you were born it's in your nature you're looking for it when it's right here we think it's going to come supernaturally and the holy spirit is going to reveal to me you call to be a prophet it's in your nature as you fall in love with god amen as you fall in love with god and you walk with the lord you go right into what you are called to do whatever your calling is so much part of you the way to find it is to find the things you love to do for the lord unconsciously you you just love it unconsciously you love the lord tonight but that's my testimony that's what i see on the international stage once again god is echoing deuteronomy chapter 31 through the walls of the european people be strong and courageous praise the lord the thing about it they are not even fighting they are not fighting all they are doing they are just protecting what belongs to them they are just standing their ground praise the lord they are just standing their ground if you would take this i have to be a dead man praise the lord and whenever a man or a woman a young man or a young woman or whoever we are become courageous and say lord i know your word is truth amen you just look through the bible we can just take different different examples all over the scripture different example all over the scripture we can just we can go back and forth and back and forth there was one that i read that that that kind of a stool out to me let me just uh share that with you and then we close here are we together first chronicle chapter 19 is all through the scripture every time be of good courage and let us behave ourselves violently for our people and for the and for the cities of our god and let the god do that which is good in his sight let god do whatever pleases him but let's do what we can do for our people amen let's be courageous and do whatever we can do what is right to do for our people find somebody to encourage find someone to pray for find someone to pray for somebody to encourage somebody to try to disciple the reason why the enemy robbed the church up there because he knows when you get doing that you become so burdened that you don't have time for gossip you don't have time for for whatever is running on facebook because you are so burdened you have this thing on your heart dwight hall thank you son musicians you can come i'm so glad i i heard the eagle call today the message of the hour is the way no matter what the people say no matter what the people do i'll try to sing it if i spot it i will stop let's than on our feet let's just bow our heads together let's just buy our hairs together let's think uh feel my cup lord we pray and then we can try that song [Music] come and quench this thirsting of my souls bread of

that one more time fill my cup fill my cup long i lift it up [Music] of my soul [Music] yes my cup filled it up and make me who let's just pray together tonight you think about that [Music] many of you young people like we would say children born in the message this is a testimony of billy graham brother someone asked him and said mevin [Music] did we ever do drugs and was there something you did in your life he said yeah he said i did drugs [Music] he said daddy dropped us to church he said from a child we go to every meeting we go to every revival we were drunk with church and it kind of it kind of break your heart because you have all of these young people [Music] i mean they don't they don't have choice the parents can't leave them home time for service change their clothes whether they want to or not all of their friends are playing running around the neighborhood they got a dress jump in the car and come now you just think about it how that child can be so confused [Music] if god don't get a hold of them and they don't get a hold of god not none of this become ever real to them think about it some they walk around their schedule to try to do everything to be in church set up their jobs [Music] just so they can be able to make it to come to church because they want to be in church some their job tied them i mean because of the hour because of the nature of their job but you but just think about it why are you making these sacrifices [Music] what does it mean to you to be here every wednesday night be here every sunday morning driving through the snow and and bad weather and all of that you think about it [Music] are you doing it just to get favor with god that god will look down on your sacrifice or on and look at the effort you have you are just coming to service so he can he can bless you i don't think that should be the reason people because if that is the reason pretty soon you will get tired because your tire might blow up on the road when there is nobody and it's freezing and the police might just come take you to a place of shelter and then you ask yourself but god why why am i tired blow up i'm serving you if you are doing it because of reward i'm telling you tonight you will you will you you will be disappointed [Music] but if you are doing it because the same thing that struck david and said though he slipped me yet we are serving

the message than the messages that brother branham preached so we had we have more excuse to leave the message now than the things that kept us in the message but can we thank god for the courage that he has given to us for us to be here tonight can we thank god for the courage that we are still serving god in this hour in the midst of all of this he has given us courage to count ourselves as one
