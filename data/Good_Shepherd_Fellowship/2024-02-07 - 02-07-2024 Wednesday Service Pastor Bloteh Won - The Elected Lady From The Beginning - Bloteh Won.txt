praise the lord it's the only one chapter so uh tell John also there only one so I think uh uh we can we can read uh uh one verse after another I read one and you read the other the second one and then and uh we all will read the last verse together there unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also all them that have known the truth truth us Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the father in Truth and Love and now and now I beses Thee lady not as though I H wrote a new Comming unto the but that which we have from the begin beginning that we love one another begin for many deceivers I enter into the word who confess not that Jesus is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist that whosoever transgresseth and beareth not in the doctrine of Christ have not God he that Abarth in the doctrine of Christ he have both the father and the [Music] son for he that be him God speed is partaker of his evil days let's read the last verse together the children of the elected sister greet thee amen let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we Just Want to Thank You Lord it's just enough Lord father reading this chapter we can close our Bibles and go home definitely the blessing of this word will be upon us Lord you said in your word blessed are them that read the word blessed are them that hear the word so father we pray that God you give us a double portion tonight we have read the word and we're going to hear the word tonight please oh god father help us uh uh and uh just give us the blessing Lord father that is that is behind this more than the preacher can be able to achieve lord it's not just bringing a message Lord God it's not just Lord trying to uh uh uh play it on the minds of the people but father is it's a burden Lord God and and and uh uh knowing that father if we can be able to see ourself Lord father in the beginning Lord God there no way we can uh for us to be able to know our destiny we must know where we came from so Lord God and and that's why we just laboring on this in one way or the other trying father to bring one thought or another to to your children but we pray that that you are the preacher you are the preacher father Lord after oh God we have expressed ourself after Lord we have Labor under inspiration we pray pray that the holy spirit will just break the word to our individual life just like John said look to yourself he said look to yourself we want to look to ourself and see what you doing in our lives tonight we love you we thank you Father undertake for us undertake for us Lord this is saming God the saints that are not here with us tonight the ones that have to work the ones that are streaming from home the ones whose heart I year and and can't be able bring their body tonight we pray that father you bless every one of us together in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen I was talking to a brother and uh uh and he says uh who am I speaking to I'm say I'm the one praise the Lord and then she this is who am I speaking to I said I'm the one you know and we went back and forth a little bit and uh and then uh I I felt I felt almost like I was frustrating him he was about to shut his phone off so I said I will be I will be you know I'll be guilty for doing this so I I just call there a way I call him so when I call him he knew straight I was the one he saw you sound different I said yeah I'm under the weather a little bit so you hear my voice uh a little bit cracky tonight so just bear with me amen but uh uh uh let's let's look at this let's look at this we we just read this this verse caught caught my attention here uh uh uh uh when we read this it it caught my attention just now beautiful verse uh that's verse eight you know uh uh look to yourself that we lose not those things which we have rough amen that we lose not those things which we have rough what actually it is that we lose not those things which we have labored with God where we have brought ourself you know if you start looking at things around you and looking at other people you will lose your personal value amen look to yourself you you you are responsible to be able to watch over there and uh I never saw it until tonight reading it just caught my mind look to yourself that we lose not those things which we have Rob but that we receive a full reward praise the Lord you have to know in you is a hidden treasure amen you have Heavenly treasure in eting vessel and you need to watch over it that's if God will hold you account for anything I mean he will hold you account for that thing more than any other thing praise the Lord but also realize tonight another thing that caught my mind here is that there are 13 verses in this in this chapter and 13 is the number of a woman praise the Lord 13 is the number of a woman whether I mean uh uh yeah this this Bible was written many years before uh uh you know uh all of these things were said before even the prophet came to tell us that 13 is the number of a woman he said you look through all the scripture you will see that uh uh uh Joshua had the people to go around the the world 13 times if you actually look at it it was 13 times and we shouldn't go through that calculation because we have done that over and over when Ruth was going to be redeemed and uh uh the Israel has they has a they has a culture when they say call the Elders the ERS have to be 10 men the ERS have to be 10 men and uh uh uh so you were realized that there were 10 men boas make it 11 the nearest Kings there was a man that was the nearest Kings the one that kick his shoes off make it 12 the 13 person was the woman that was concerned Ruth she makes it 13 and uh and and you can you I mean we can go through the scriptures we have we have speak on these things many times we don't want to but it just it just grabed my attention that Paul that John is talking about the elected lady he's he's he's writing about the elected lady and the Holy Spirit uh you know uh uh uh make it that these men that wrote the Bible had to make this second episode of John 13 verse that that that just stood up to me uh it might not mean not nothing don't don't make it a big deal but uh uh to me uh it's uh I I I felt I felt a little sense of edification when I when I was reading through and and saw that and uh science even prove it you know science prove it that the woman uh she's on 13 cycles of her life in a year if you read if you read the count it you take count of it that's exactly what it is she's under 13 cycles of her life in the year it's proven by science now so uh uh uh praise the Lord your thoughts are firing at me amen I can feel your thoughts what is he saying are we together amen you know he a church that makes a good preacher amen amen if the people can bear with you and your foolishness it be a good preacher Paul says the preaching of the Gospel is foolishness so for them that believe are we together amen amen so we want to talk about the elected lady from the beginning John here writing this episode and remember now we've been on of this thing since the beginning of the year you know there are people that that that have different different approach the brother from the UK they had preached for us last year I think March he was around in March he speak for us brother Crosby it was 2023 so he was preaching on 23 and he took the Lord's sh the the the what is it from from David Psalm 23 so Psalm 23 was his message he was beginning with because it was 23 you know and I picked that up also last year on the convention there in South Africa there's a brother from Namibia that that were called to greet the church and he took 23 23 23 23 I mean beautiful way he brought it I said wow these guys are smart praise the Lord I'm not built that way I'm not a numbers man not too good in mou anyway so uh but I I saw this uh uh uh thing about the beginning and it all came from uh uh uh talking about the impact that the vision of pmos had on John praise the Lord and if John is a type of the bribe that Vision will impact this bride also praise the Lord amen it will it will change the way we look at things in the scripture now this this is not a man's doing this is not a man's doing if you are in the in the hands of the Holy Ghost he's going to deal with you just the way that he want to deal with you amen praise the Lord so it is not something that we trying to force down your throat no no I mean we are not trying to force it down your tro we're just trying to to edify you and say open your eyes there are a lot of things that is happening amen there are a lot of things that is happening around us live for your head your Redemption dur night so just like I said uh this uh 13 verses caught my attention and I'm going to talk on the elected lady from the beginning John says there he onto the elect lady and her children praise the Lord now as he Clos as he closed the chapter the last verse he said the children of the elect sister greet thee so this gave us an idea that John was not talking to a particular lady she he was talking to a church right because he was bringing greetings from the other elect church so he was saying your uh your sister you know uh all the children of uh the elect sister which mean the church members of the other churches send greetings to you are we together amen so this this kind of forgive us uh uh uh an idea here that uh John on the island of pmos that's what we want to look at going back to the beginning John he got he got a Vision or he was imparted to see something that that was coming in view that he can take back to the beginning Revelation chapter 19 let's read that Revelation chapter 19 sorry Revelation chapter 19 praise the Lord are we together you know we have this this uh hand sanitizer on the year is it's been very helpful for me most especially during the time of communion and uh uh I always wash my hands before I come up but as a preacher I have to preach I touch the pullit and do some different things and then just before commun I always used that it's always it's been a blessing praise the Lord I'm telling you some of the things I do when your eyes are closed let's read verse seven I got to get a preaching tonight I got to get a preaching brother won stop there get a preaching tonight let's read verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be array in fine laning clean and white for the fine laning is the righteousness of the Saints now realize that John is seeing all of these things on a vision an angel is speaking to him praise the Lord amen amen now as as you will go on as you will go on we speak we we we spoke on this he comes down here and uh verse 9 and he said uh and he said unto me the angel said unto me right right John blessed are they which I called unto the marage supp of the lamb and he said unto me these are the truth saying of God these are the truth saying that look this this is not just a plane these things are going to happen amen there's going to be a marriage of the Lamb these are the TR saying of God the angel is making emphasis to John this is not something to make you just to create an interest for you to go to heaven whether you go or not is going to happen look you know Heaven is going to be beautiful it's it's going to be beautiful those things does not appeal to the soul right it can only play on the spirit for a while these are the truth saying of God Amen praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh I think I went ahead of myself I should have read from verse one down to 7 and I read from 7 to 9 but that's fine and uh so John on a vision he's seing this thing and now since since Jesus introduced himself to John uh uh in Revelation chapter 3:14 as the beginning of the creation of God John now on our steud now that's the way we are looking at it John now has started to bring everything back to the beginning beginning whatever he sees here in Genesis he brings back to the beginning because you have to also remember that what we have in the Bible as the beginning of creation the the the uh Genesis the beginning of creation the the the the time of Noah all of those things were written by Moses but Moses was not there Moses was given those account by Vision when God told Moses in the mountain uh 40 days and 40 nights God gave him the Bible says God show him a vision about the PN of heaven so all of these things in the first day God created this the second day God created Moses was not there he wrote all of those things by vision and because the people believe that God spoke to Moses they believe it amen and you and myself we believe it science is the one that is trying to question oh that it was a big bang it was oh we don't believe what the Bible says you don't believe what the Bible say because you don't believe the prophet praise the Lord amen Moses is the one that wrote it and anybody coming up coming up to challenge Moses Authority on Genesis 1 you're just kicking yourself out of the Kingdom praise the Lord you think about Moses coming down from the mountain and he's giving this to the people and the and no no let the Council of others come down and sit down let's sit down and and then we can be able to look at all of these things and you know and prove whether uh uh it's truth that uh you know whether we can prove it that it is Tru that God gave it to you I mean it was just it was just uh you see God God did something when the people challenged Moses after tempting him many years and tempting him and and and arguing and gossiping about him and everything when God brought him down to that Showdown where he opened the Earth and and put all the people there close the Earth give a m grave praise the Lord you think about that he opened the Earth and swallowed all of those h h a thousand of people that was standing with Koran and d and fasting against Moses and he closed the Earth praise the Lord you know Hans have never change praise the Lord I'm sure there were people that were stay doubting and people that were stay struggling and people that were stay arguing but for the many of them the fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord praise the Lord in the book of Acts Acts chapter 5 God did the same thing in the church service just like we are having a man ananas and his wife God allowed the church to witness a striking death and that that same God live tonight is the same God that we are serving praise the Lord amen is the same God we we are seven now I'm I'm not bringing a skar Titus to you and say you got to be careful God will that's not what I'm doing but what I'm saying is that U God has a way of getting our attention he has a way of putting you to a place where you can know that he's he he he exists and he's the one that alter your life and he's in control you can do nothing without him he has a way of doing it praise the Lord I don't know where I'm going but I'm going anyway this week I was thinking about that thing and it it just being on my mind you know I was talking with a friend of mine back home and uh uh uh you see the age you know the time that we are living in and you have you have these things that is in the in in in the minds of the Young Generation oh you know I I I I want to be financially independent you know H uh you know and I want to be uh uh what is the next thing to talk about poverty you know every poverty you know and and you know fighting against poverty and financially independ and I was just I was just thinking about that trying to put it in the context until we leave this life will always have something to depend on praise the Lord and as Sons and Daughters of God God don't want your Independence to be on your fine eyes he will bless you with fine eyes if he want to bless you with fine eyes but he want your Independence to be on the word is the word that bring us independence him that the son set free is free inde let me tell you what happened let me tell you what happened if you just if you just look at it in in that in that in that context like Jesus said no man can serve two masters praise the Lord so you find all of these people that are streaming to these things they are streaming to this thing you know and and and get out of poverty and then you know and and they are streaming to those things there is always always a trap the devil is he stay there praise the Lord you have to realize that he don't want to take religion from you it's not what he want he want your religion to be powerless he want your religion to just be a form just come on Wednesday night praise the Lord come on Sunday morning and have no power there is no reality there is no connection of of this thing that you are believing there is no connection so you find all of these people that are screaming to all of these things uh uh uh look think about it you think about it it was not strange to almighty God he knew being the creator of Heaven and Earth he knew exactly how Solomon would have ended right and the Bible says that if you even read the scripture if you read the scripture and put it in context it was not Solomon praying he was not praying he had a dream and the dream came from the desire of his heart God saw the desire of his heart how am I going to lead these people praise the Lord and God came down and and and told him and say Solomon I've seen the desire of your heart that you want to Le my people and because you have desired this I'm going to bless you I'm going to bless you praise the Lord I will give you wisdom I will also give you riches and none of us that want to be financially free financially independent none of us will reach to Solomon level no matter how much we strive even the seat he was sitting in they go around it it can build another country it was God giving the Bible says what God gives he added no sorrow to it praise the Lord I'm not trying to rob you of your Ambitions it's good for you to have Ambitions praise the Lord but look to the Lord for the result if not you will start cutting Corners with the word you will start cutting corners and when you start cutting Corners you are just cheating yourself you are just cheating yourself Solomon at the end of his life he said Lord just give me enough to carry me through the rest of my life I don't want to lose everything I'll blaspheme against your name and because I had too much I've have gone into idolatry where am I going tonight supposed to be talking about the elected lady praise the Lord so we see here that John hearing this call from Revelation chapter 19 he seen the bride and the Bible says as you read down John he saw the New Jerusalem coming down like a bride a door for her husband and all of those things that he that he's thinking about no wonder I think that John could imagine in his mind what it was like for for for Adam and Eve how their marriage ceremony was I think John in his mind T about it Genesis chapter one let's go right there Genesis chapter 1 praise the Lord you find all of these fancy teachers on the word you know you find all these fancy teachers they you know they study they they get tickle by think and and and they try to show here that and and and and God said let us let us may uh let us may man in our image praise the Lord verse 27 and so God created Man In His Image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them they tried to run with this to show that there was a man on Earth before Adam praise the Lord amen they tried to show they tried to use the to show that there was a civilization on Earth before Adam but it will not run through the scripture you cannot run it through the scripture if there was a man on the earth before Adam Jesus would not be the second Adam Jesus supposed to be that man because he was the first and all of those things the four on people that have itching ears the thing is a revelation now wow there was another man before Adam you see that's that man have a children that's where King went to get his wife and all sorts of things oh my God right I will tell you what are you like it or not we thank God for a prophet amen amen praise the lord we never made him a prophet amen he never made himself a prophet we only saw his ministry in the pages of the word a promise to our day are we together now so uh we see here the Bible says so God created Man In His Image St John 412 said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so if God created this man in His image this Genesis 126 man was a spirit man he didn't had a body and that Spirit man was both male and female God was representing both the the the male and the female then in Genesis chapter 2 that was where God created Man Out of the Dust of the earth and then he put that Spirit man into that body are we together but what what I want to bring bring to you here is there God created man in In His Image male and female created he them and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful we come we'll deal with that on our last our last session of this beginning we on the sixth and we have the seven that uh will we we'll get back to to this Pro This Promise year of being fruitful the multiply amen but but what what I want us to look at is that uh this uh this Promise This Promise of uh uh God you know uh uh uh uh making Man In His Image male and female and the Bible says he blessed him praise the Lord let's let's read a little bit here maybe that will help me to bring my TOS together I'm almost out of time when I start rumbling all over the place yeah I get get distracted marish of the lamb and that we know that there is going to be a bride and there is going to be a wedding supper s in the sky that's just as as sure to be as God is because it's his word amen and we know that are those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they are going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle amen that's that's that's what God says he's he's going to give himself a bride without spot praise the Lord something he said in marish and div voice IID like to share with you tonight but let's go ahead year now if we can be able to get through all of this this was just there for our our introduction he says he's going to get a bride there with our spot and and they have the material on earth now to make themsel ready the material for that bride Hallelujah is the word the material that make the first bride was the word praise the Lorden MH he says that material is on Earth right now to make them say ready if you notice it said she has made herself ready amen we have a work to do amen am that's how that's why we have to look to ourself amen we have a work to do amen this blame game is not going to work it did not work for Adam in the beginning it's not going to work for you it's not going to work for me right well we always want to find somebody to be to be our problem it's not going to work we have a responsibility this Bride made herself ready she has the material the word has been given to us we need to use that word and prepare ourself praise the Lord and the devil want to trouble our mind I mean why why listen to him and carry yourself through a depressing State why can't you take the promises from the word praise the Lord I can tell you what the word says but I can't keep it on your mind I try to keep you on my mind as much as I can so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit okay yeah BR addressing the same thing yeah so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling from lying stealing I will serve him but that's up to you see you got something you you you got to do something too praise the Lord this Supernatural Deliverance does not work God is say God he can deliver his people any way he choose amen but you see the the the the the the way the principle work if you look back in the Book of Judges you you will see God gave them a promise he said I will send HS to fight for you he said I will drive them up God himself came down in the form of of of the captain of the Lord host and God gave them many Supernatural Deliverance but when you get to the end of the book God told him because you allow these things you have to fight it out if now they're going to be torn in your flesh so you see when we gave our heart to the Lord the Lord comes and he do Supernatural things he takes things away from our life and then we get in our work and we get so complacent now we are believers you know I'm not legalistic people just like to be legalistic and before you realize we start picking up the very same thing that the Lord has delivered us from and when we trap ourself in it we say oh God please deliver me no he said you got to fight it okay you got to fight it that's the principle that is in the word at the beginning of of of of Joshua God delivered the people he sent Hil Stones he did many Supernatural thing to deliver them and that is the same way with us he Deliver us through the preaching of the word many Supernatural things there are habits that left our life we did not practice for them to live God took it away amen amen but when we tramped on the blood of Jesus Christ when we count the grace of God yeah we are we we that Grace I'm I'm I'm free so BR B says here if the Lord will take this evil spirit people says he said from drinking gambling and stealing I will self him but that's but that's up to you see you got something to do they that they that overcome shall inherit all things you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see it she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push you through a pipe pull you out on the other side and says blessed is he that overcome you had nothing to overcome he just push you through but you have got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decision for myself in doing this we show our faith and respect to God when we make decisions and it's a Earnest decision as far as my conviction this is the way I see the word this is this is the way I seeing I'm not seeing it to be to be popular that's my conviction that's what brother Bram is saying God respect that it's a respect to God are we together now he says this this is going to happen as sure as there is God is there is going to be a bride so John under this vision is seeing the he's seeing the elect lady All Through the Ages he's seeing why God how to how to how to use H Rahab the whole city will fall only one woman for one woman's sake God will keep a war only that war that that war the same War where the spies came down was the only war that was standing and as soon as RAB and her family I don't even know how they got down maybe she used the same cord and as those men are you sure this thing is not going to fall I'm sure that John could see in a life of teror that she she was an elect lady praise the Lord because you see just like Peter Peter struggle with his vision I have never eaten anything that is unclean the Jews they could not see there there they could not understand God dealing with the Gentiles they couldn't they couldn't understand it it had to take the Holy Ghost it had to take the New Testament Church that's the reason why those Jews they stood against Paul they say he's bringing unclean people into the into the temple because they never wanted the Gentile that were that were that were coming to Salvation to come into the temple praise the Lord sometimes when we the same thing we do sometimes we we you know we judge people by our our denomination they are not dressing like us and you know what we must not allow them to come in the church and all of that okay let's just move forward we don't have time are we together now so you can see here he saw the elect lady I knew I was struggle to bring this tonight because uh there just so much on my mind to just uh uh uh but we trust the Lord amen let's look at another thing brother Bram said in uh in invisible Union it's a quote that we all love talking about uh de Moody we all love that let's look at that maybe we find a place to close here I can pick this up another time I'm having a whole year to preach in the beginning amen praise the Lord when you are tired you just tell the deacons they will come and see me invisible un brother B says Mr M after reading Romans 7 ran into the Street and the first man he met he said to him do you know Grace and the man replied Grace who Mr Moody said the grace of God now Romans chapter 7 is where Paul says a woman cannot be married until her first husband died amen Dr Moi could see the grace of God in that applying to us but you see the picture here you got you got to see the picture right our first husband did not die the grace there is that we die we died and came to newness of Life praise the Lord that's the reason why he think he still have right to us but the grace of God brought us through the the the the the death burier and resurrection of Jesus Christ you see when when you understand these things and you run it through the way the Apostle Paul see it you will see why the apostles were they were very strong on on the revelation of baptism that came to them they knew what the church was imposing on the people that is the grace of God the grace of God is that we were the one that died amen we were the one that died am I preaching the false Doctrine tonight you think the first husband died no no no no no no no that's the reason why he can remind you of your past he can remind you of the fun time you used to have you know those days but you ask him I don't know what you're talking about that's not me the person you're talking about is that one praise the Lord the one you talking about she's being dead he died long time praise the Lord didn't you witness his barrier when they took him down to the water and he went down in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he rose up in newness of life that's what the Bible says yes praise the Lord now you see it will it will make sense to you when I read this thing that brother Bram said in uh in uh in in in in marriage and divorce that the Virgin say of the church is the word when God call you a virgin bride it's not it's not your body it's not your activities it's not yourself the Virgin bride is you taking the pure word your identification to the pure word that's what makes you a virgin why because when you come out behold all all things are pass away all things becomes new praise the Lord and your baptism is a word baptism it's not a church baptism it's a word baptism so when you come up in that newness of life amen amen praise the Lord he don't have a whole he he does not have a ho on you he goes and bring the old marriage certificate and says look you see that's that's that's my wife he belongs to me praise the Lord Brother Braham says God slip a ring of unmit Grace on your [Music] finger oh my thank you you love the Lord tonight glory be to God he says Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound thou save a rash like me thou save a rash like me that was what Grace did honor the Lord is the the first husand have to die before the before the woman and think about it elected woman yeah I elected lady was also played in the life of Abigail praise the Lord she have this h no no about this foolish man that just drank and all of that glory be to God and Y say she run she ran in the field and and I mean the kind of a service that she gave to David you know and and and apologizing to him amen and all of that I know David was thinking in his mind my goodness how can a dummy like this have have such a wife glory be to God the Bible says the next day when the Lord when the Lord visited neor David raised up his hand he said thank God I've have not I have not put the blood on my hands praise the Lord amen thank God but you have to also realize that it was because of Abigail she St she stepped right into the Gap she was an elected woman for that time for that purpose so God played the elected lady all through John seeing this woman he seeing this woman Behold The Marriage of the Lamb come and see the Lamb's wife he's looking at the vision and he's also looking back in his mind and seeing All Through the Ages how God using different people playing out Amazing Grace how sweet that sound that safe a rush like me Grace precious Grace more of Grace to know Ah that's my best part of this quote there is more of Grace to know amen if you think that you know the grace of God you have not come close to it you have not stretched yourself surface of God's grace there are more grace to know praise the Lord that's the reason why it does not benefit you and myself to hold anything against anybody because we don't have Grace to give to nobody it's only God that give Grace there's more of Grace to know for for it is by Grace we are saved not not by what we can do and may I add to this woman Grace now brother Bram here John call her the elected lady brother bam is calling her grace he's calling the elected Lady Grace may I add to this woman this Miss Grace I'm going to talk about her you know the Bible declared said to the to the elect lady if you notice elect comes from the word elected lady one lady among all the other ladies was elected like the Virgin was to bring forth the body of God on Earth she was an elected lady God choose Mary and also God has chosen an elected lady which is his bride see elected I hope we are members of that tonight across the world praise the Lord are we members of that tonight can we say amen amen thank you Jesus amen God's calling to the to the elected they know it calling calling The Virtuous bride the word he see so he's bringing the bride back to the word so when you look there in Genesis chapter 1 H H God expressing he's speaking his word let's let's make man in our image God created Man In His Image which image was the lust so you see the bride was in the original image of God she was also in a logos form praise the Lord the Lord now you have to realize that uh uh uh uh uh you know we we we we we in we in a society with all of this gender confusion God is not confused amen oh he's not confused praise the Lord because when God looks at gender he looks at uh uh attributes praise the Lord he looks at attributes just like I've said before all through the word all through the word nobody came out and and and design that a woman should be a preschool or kindergarten teacher nobody designed that but it's something that is done all through the world why because of that mother nature that is in her praise the Lord amen it's been proven over and over again that she will have more patient with the children than a man will have he's ready to walk out of the door two things either walk out of the door or allow them to do what they want to do you're Clos to you're close to Door kids you're just playing in time like this he just get on his cell phone and allow the kids to play and enjoy themsel a mother would not do that praise the Lord she will want to interact with them she will want to be concerned Why this one is sign what what are you crying it's in her to do it guys we don't have it praise the lord we can never come close it's God's design he gave them the ability for that he didn't give a man virtue he didn't give a man sacri you let me say it that way so you can be able to get get my touch here amen he gave it to the woman because of redemption now so we see there God call calling to the elect they know it calling The Virtuous bride the word she's the word the the the the the the last the church the elected Lady of our Lord Jesus the word if Jesus is the word how many believe that all right then the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it will have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ the word once again is going to take on flesh praise the Lord the word may flesh God borrowing your body to show that there is a Creator to show that there is a Healer God boring your body you see the thing about it there is that we have a measure so we cannot constantly live like Jesus he had the fullness so God wait for a situation praise the Lord as he keeps us in an atmosphere Keeps Us walking with the word meditating on the word he waits for the situation then the logos comes and pick up our body if there is one that is sick H and and and and and and we believe in that one we lay our hands on the promise because you are acting on the word the logos comes through your body to honor that word hallelujah amise the thing that that that that make uh uh uh uh Christians frustrated is because sometimes we think we have to be just on the housetop we have to be on the H stop praise the Lord Elijah prayed for the Ravens to bring F I'm not going to work Lord you got to you are the god of Elijah where is the god of elij you will die with with Hunger praise the Lord because in that instance you are impersonating are we together so we see here that John is looking at the elected lady that vision is affecting him and he's coming back and he gave this uh name to the church in Jo mind in Jo mind he saw the church has already arrived praise the Lord amen is this is it not is is that not a season Pastor you come to your church and say good morning Rapture church rapturing church praise the Lord oh yes sure enough it's so easy that the Pastor said good morning rapturing church glorious church it's a glorious church with spot Ringle you are a glorious church with our spot Ringle praise the Lord and the preacher will greet you that way but yeah you say that if you knew what I'm going through you will not even say that if you knew what I'm going through Pastor you will not even say that for John it does not matter amen for him it does not matter he already saw the church arrive praise the Lord you got to pick yourself up yes and get to do it and kick away all of those things that are troubling you and are bothering you and trying to handle you from this glorious promise amen you got to get to business with God get back to the word get back to praying are we together oh glory be to God hallelujah so we see the select a lady all through now one of the places that I I would have loved to come tonight and and good that I never came there I I was going to take I was going to take uh uh Esther because Esther really display the elector there is there is lot of things there in in in in Esther you know that that another time we will pick up with this elected lady and uh uh but there's what I wanted to bring to you one was that Romans chapter 7 one so you can realize you know that it is not our old husand that is theread we are the one that is dead praise the Lord you see that's the reason why if after we have been identified with Christ if you go back to the world you are committing spiritual adultery why because in the newness of life and that is the thing that needs to come to us as a revelation we still struggle we we we we we struggle with this our old life and when I used to be this and I used to be that praise the Lord you just love your dead body you let you love your dead body because that that that that is not you if you are in Christ then you are dead to the word and that is the thing that needs to come more rear to us us and it was beautiful just just seeing that just just being able to understand that that we are the one that is there because that's what the scripture says praise the Lord so when a woman is dead the man is free to go and marry when the man is dead the woman is free to go marry but in our case since this this old serpent the devil his death is waiting at the Lake of Fire so Grace brought a newness of life to us he put us to Death In the Flesh and that is the thing that is blowing the devil's mind because he's seen you having the same expression he's seeing you you know uh the same age he seeing you the same height then he say how is this person you but what he's not seeing is that he's not seeing the Myster of God's grace that is working inside you the Myster of God's grace that is working from inside is a work from inside out that's what he's not seeing that's the reason why you don't have to look at the things around you look to yourself amen brother says look at your your motives and your objectives look at your desire praise the Lord when God came down to David what God honor was David desire to build a temple not his ability to build a temple he had the ability God say I don't want your ability I want your desire amen amen if you can get the right desire I can put my ability behind it and accomplish it because when it is your ability you going to break he want your desire so when Solomon got the right desire he said that's what I'm looking for your desire to rightly judge these people I will give you wisdom so God is looking at our desire he don't need your ability praise the Lord God do not need your ability he's the almighty God he's the all powerful God he just need that channel amen of you having the right desire Lord I want to lay for you I want to lay for you I want to surrender I want to give you my all it must not just be something here in your mind you must be able to take it from here and bring it down here the Lord bless you tonight musicians can come we we'll make a second pH of this and uh as we trust the Lord to be able to help us this is my desire we brought out the difference between Solomon and David what was David desire to D in the house of the Lord all the days of his life and to inquire in his Temple what are we Desiring tonight this is my desire let's sing that chorus tonight before we [Music] pray [Music] with all within me I give you [Music] praise all that I adore is in
