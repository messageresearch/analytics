[3:58] man Ador
[4:00] Emmanuel in a
[4:03] stable the most and there were people
[4:06] out there at the same days teaching
[4:09] their theology great crowds drawing
[4:12] everywhere from all over the land they
[4:14] come to sacrifices which Jehovah said
[4:16] was a stench in his
[4:19] nostrils and here was humbl Shepherds in
[4:22] a stable adoring
[4:25] Emmanuel God himself made flesh and land
[4:29] in a
[4:31] stable see how we with our great
[4:35] learnings and our head sticking back
[4:37] like we know something and God bypasses
[4:40] the whole
[4:42] thing he does what he promises to do and
[4:46] he always does that but think of these
[4:48] lowly Shepherds out there now adoring a
[4:52] Emmanuel in a stable it's most striking
[4:55] sure is then out at they had adored him
[5:00] and realized that the message that they
[5:02] had been preaching was Vindicated there
[5:05] they were out praising God with the most
[5:10] incredible message of an
[5:13] Angel I'll compare that with today just
[5:17] stop a minute and
[5:18] think
[5:20] man out adoring God and praising him for
[5:25] what they had seen what they had heard
[5:27] what they knew was the truth with a
[5:30] message that was
[5:32] incredible to the intellectual mind it
[5:36] was contrary to all ecclesiastical
[5:40] thinking and yet it was a truth it's the
[5:44] truth they believe it and now how
[5:47] foolish can the wisdom of man
[5:50] be then saying that an angel choir sang
[5:55] to them the first
[5:58] noil could you imagine that that a
[6:01] Shepherd That Couldn't Write his name
[6:03] smelling like a sheep
[6:05] pen walking down the street Hing glory
[6:08] to God in the
[6:10] highest we know that he's on Earth the
[6:14] priest said that man's out of his mind
[6:17] look up on the books and see if he's a
[6:18] member of our
[6:19] congregation he certainly embarrasses Us
[6:23] by un ethical teachings get him away
[6:26] from us we will not be embarrassed
[6:28] amongst the people well you can be
[6:30] embarrassed amongst the people and
[6:32] glorified in the sight of God or take
[6:34] your
[6:36] choice because remember the
[6:39] ecclesiastical tastes of the day don't
[6:41] fit God's word there's not no 969
[6:44] different tastes of it it's one taste
[6:46] one word one God that's
[6:49] all saying that Angels sang The First
[6:52] Noel to him and also sing that uh they
[6:56] got a message from an angel an angel
[6:59] appeared to give him a message and they
[7:00] went and found out that message was
[7:01] truth and say besides that the angel
[7:03] sing the first oil to us could you
[7:06] imagine they said that poor fell they
[7:09] never had anything like that to happen
[7:10] among them you know so it was kind of
[7:12] strange Doctrine to them that's the
[7:14] reason they couldn't find it in the
[7:16] Scriptures it wasn't for him to find it
[7:18] incredible to the wise no such
[7:21] experience had ever happened to them
[7:23] unbelievable but still it was the truth
[7:26] it's the truth we know it's the truth
[7:27] think Christ first Converse and first
[7:33] congregation was Sheep Man not clergy
[7:37] man Sheep
[7:39] Man
[7:41] herders wow Shepherds
[7:45] notice out praising and glorifying God
[7:48] for what they had seen and heard heard
[7:51] Angels Sing for their first time to a
[7:55] human
[7:57] being Angels Are Never sing to human
[7:59] being before and look at the choirs how
[8:03] they had stood and trained and trained
[8:05] those voices they had sang at the birth
[8:07] of the Messiah and they were all
[8:11] bypassed and Angels came down and sang
[8:14] to Common Sheep
[8:16] Man not with clergy clothes on but with
[8:20] Shepherd's clothes
[8:22] on and look who got the first
[8:25] message is
[8:27] incredible and where it was given
[8:30] not in the cathedrals but in the
[8:33] wilderness out in the wilderness where
[8:36] the angel of the Lord
[8:38] came not in the church in the wilderness
[8:41] he wasn't even welcome in the church
[8:43] they thought he was they thought they
[8:45] had it but God proved that it was
[8:49] wrong he's able these stones to rise
[8:51] children to Abraham that's right the
[8:54] first time Angels ever
[8:57] sang at a celebration it was in
[9:00] heaven if you look in job 38:7 I to see
[9:04] some of you taking notes when God first
[9:08] planned on making his first creation the
[9:12] Earth job was a great smart man and he
[9:15] had all kinds of wisdom he said when I
[9:17] go up to the markets the young princes
[9:20] they all bow before me in just want a
[9:22] moment of my wisdom and he couldn't
[9:24] figure out why he had to be treated the
[9:25] way he
[9:27] was and so God asked him said g yourself
[9:31] up like a man because I'm coming down to
[9:33] talk to you and when God came down in a
[9:35] horor wind he said job where was you
[9:40] before I laid the foundations of the
[9:43] Earth when the morning Stars sang
[9:46] together and the sons of God shouted for
[9:48] Joy where were you then job and he was
[9:52] deflated at that
[9:53] time where was you see the first time
[9:57] Angels ever sang at a celebration was in
[10:00] heaven but the first time they ever sang
[10:03] on Earth was the Shepherds at the birth
[10:06] of God Emmanuel on
[10:09] Earth first human beings ever heard an
[10:12] angel sing was humble
[10:15] Shepherds when we take our painted faed
[10:19] women bobbed hair wearing shorts and
[10:22] swing some kind of a church robe around
[10:24] him and stand up and sing like something
[10:26] and then we think if God has to listen
[10:28] to that he he got Angels back on who can
[10:31] entertain him sense before he ever made
[10:33] a human
[10:36] being get out and live and wear clothes
[10:40] that's an Abomination to God and how can
[10:43] you expect that to be of
[10:46] God you say well I belong to where was
[10:49] you when I laid the foundations of the
[10:52] Earth tell me where I fasten them to
[10:57] where is the axle that they turn
[10:59] on where were you then you think God has
[11:03] to ask us for some of our wisdom our
[11:06] wisdom is only foolish to him he does
[11:08] what he says he will
[11:11] do now notice God is fixing to make
[11:14] another creation he creating mortal
[11:17] Earth mortal life Angels sing in heaven
[11:21] but here he's creating a new life
[11:24] eternal life for
[11:26] man and he sing to his objects through
[11:30] Angels on the earth not in heaven heaven
[11:34] had eternal life see and he saying they
[11:37] sing to the heavens when the Mortal
[11:40] creation come in and here the immortal
[11:43] creation is coming in and now they're
[11:45] singing to Earthly people the first time
[11:48] the Shepherds striking isn't
[11:52] it he had started a new creation what
[11:55] was it a creation of himself God was
[11:59] made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the
[12:02] Bible said in the beginning of the
[12:04] creation of God God was created in human
[12:07] Farm in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt
[12:11] he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and
[12:13] Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God
[12:16] Emmanuel God With
[12:19] Us he built himself a house to live in
[12:22] it so he could respect his word to his
[12:25] subjects through that you know what God
[12:27] is when you see Christ
[12:29] remember there is always singing at the
[12:33] birth of a king how many know that of
[12:35] course you did well now do you think of
[12:37] this king would have been born down
[12:38] there a a woman would have come run into
[12:40] the cathedral somewhere and said make a
[12:42] bed ready right quick and get the
[12:44] doctors because I'm going to bring
[12:45] Emanuel to the earth a poor woman out of
[12:49] Nazareth the lowest city the meaner than
[12:51] Tucson or any the rest of them and yet
[12:53] this little woman comes running up there
[12:55] to the great high priest and said I'm
[12:57] fixing to give birth to you man know
[12:59] that throw her in jail you sure would
[13:03] they certainly would such a hares is
[13:05] that to be brought amongst his people he
[13:07] wouldn't have stood for it nether would
[13:09] he today but just the same is happening
[13:12] just the same notice there has to be
[13:15] singing Kings would he wouldn't have
[13:17] been sing to the people wouldn't have
[13:19] sang to him because they didn't believe
[13:21] him that's the reason here it comes you
[13:25] might as well get it that's the reason
[13:26] today the people's ashamed to praise God
[13:29] they're ashamed of
[13:32] Christ the great Cathedrals won't
[13:34] receive the baptism of the Holy
[13:37] Ghost they're so set in their
[13:39] ecclesiastical ways that they will not
[13:42] receive it God's going to find somebody
[13:45] that he can get praised
[13:47] through He's Able of the stones to rise
[13:50] children to Abraham as I quote John
[13:53] again notice his subjects must sing to
[13:56] him and his subjects then was
[13:59] his angels and they sang to his
[14:02] Shepherds which was to take his message
[14:04] who should hear it first of course his
[14:08] subjects that's who would hear the King
[14:10] singing first would be his subjects and
[14:12] what was his
[14:13] subjects kind he striking isn't it
[14:15] brother it wasn't his clergymen it
[14:18] wasn't the
[14:20] theologians that's right it wasn't the
[14:22] denominational people no it was
[14:26] Shepherds why there a sheep born
[14:29] that's the reason see his subjects heard
[14:32] it who God knew would believe God sent
[14:36] his message to those who would believe
[14:37] it he's all wisdom he knows where to
[14:40] send his message who will believe it the
[14:43] highest of Heavens sent to the lowest of
[14:44] man upon the Earth Jesus said in Matthew
[14:48] 5 blessed are the poor in spirit for
[14:52] theirs is a kingdom of heaven marry and
[14:55] if you're putting scriptures down that's
[14:57] Matthew 5 and if you're putting
[14:58] scriptures down what I have written here
[14:59] scriptures Mary said in
[15:02] luke2 when she was anointed with the
[15:04] spirit the Holy Ghost upon her she said
[15:07] he has exalted them of low
[15:09] degree Mary said that the mother of
[15:13] Jesus said he has exalted those of low
[15:17] degree Luke also said the Common People
[15:20] heard him gladly not the the
[15:24] elite the the theologians the doctors of
[15:28] the law and of divinity but the Common
[15:30] People heard him gladly people of low
[15:35] degree throughout all Sacred
[15:39] Scriptures the message of redemption has
[15:42] been given by Shepherds and through
[15:45] sheep I have to come to a close because
[15:48] we're getting time to close I'm
[15:52] bypassing many scriptures just so I can
[15:54] get you to this thought throughout all
[15:57] scripture
[15:59] Redemption has been represented through
[16:03] Shepherds and
[16:04] sheep that's right we all agree that why
[16:08] it was in Shadow and tight and anything
[16:11] if I never had seen my hand and I look
[16:14] down here at my hand Shadow and I see I
[16:16] had five fingers I would know that it
[16:19] was reflecting the negative was
[16:21] reflecting a positive and that's why the
[16:24] message always came to uh Redemption by
[16:28] sheep because calls from the very
[16:30] beginning and it was through sheep and
[16:32] by Shepherds that he revealed himself
[16:35] all was shadows and TI now let us look
[16:36] at the beginning Adam and Eve standing
[16:39] there in the presence of God to hear his
[16:42] message to them they had greated about
[16:45] their loins the skin of
[16:48] sheep the first message was ever heard
[16:51] was given over the top of a dead sheep
[16:55] that God had slew and wrapped Adam and
[16:58] Eve in him after they tried to make
[17:00] their own religion of fig leaves it
[17:02] wouldn't
[17:03] work sheep sacrifice has been instituted
[17:07] for atonement since the very beginning
[17:10] sheep sacrifice now we're going to close
[17:12] this off now and show you why it had to
[17:14] be Shepherds and why it had to be he had
[17:16] to be a sheep
[17:18] now the prophets of the Old Testament
[17:21] graped themselves in sheep skins we know
[17:24] that uhhuh signifying their faith in his
[17:28] word word of the coming perfect lamb
[17:32] that's why the prophets now the word of
[17:35] God does not come to a theologian
[17:37] there's no he he's one messes it
[17:40] up that's right there's no such a thing
[17:43] as ever seeing you say well this guy's a
[17:45] theologian that just puts him farther
[17:47] away from the word than anything I know
[17:49] of the word of the Lord God the
[17:53] unchanging God never does change
[17:55] anywhere in the Bible the word of God
[17:58] always way did come to prophets
[18:02] am not to theologians or
[18:06] doctors the prophets and they always
[18:10] every time was refused and
[18:12] rejected prophets was usually herdsman
[18:18] also prophets graped themselves in sheep
[18:20] skins because they wore the skin of the
[18:22] sheep they were
[18:24] hurden and the first message to A A A
[18:27] condemned generation
[18:30] was over the top of sheep
[18:32] skins prophets I say again wor sheep
[18:35] skins raped around themselves because
[18:37] they were testifying by that that they
[18:40] believed that there was coming a perfect
[18:42] lamb for that sacrifice and the word of
[18:44] the god came to them over the top of
[18:47] sheep skins these herdsmen or these
[18:50] prophets usually were herdsmen Abraham
[18:52] was a herdsman Isaac was a herdsman
[18:55] Jacob was a herdsman Moses was a
[18:57] herdsman David was a herdsman amen all
[19:01] of God's Representatives usually were
[19:02] herdsmen now we're going to find out why
[19:05] it come to Shepherds they knew the Sheep
[19:09] is helpless without the shepherd to
[19:11] guide them they a sheep is perfectly
[19:14] helpless he cannot go by himself that's
[19:17] the reason God likened his believing
[19:19] children un sheep they've got to be
[19:21] guided but watch what's guiding
[19:26] you don't get a goat amen he'll walk you
[19:29] to the slaughter
[19:31] pin God never give us a goat he gave us
[19:35] his
[19:36] son the holy spirit to guide us he is
[19:39] our God not some manmade herdsman but a
[19:45] god-given
[19:47] herdsman who feeds the Sheep upon sheep
[19:51] food now you take a pig and you say to
[19:55] this pig I'm going to make you a lamb
[19:58] and you washing and you paint his
[20:00] toenails and and so forth and give him
[20:03] food like a sheep uh give him uh some
[20:06] kind of a a dive and put him out on the
[20:09] floor or out in the where the the Sheep
[20:12] her in the alaly field or something and
[20:14] if there's a mud hole anywhere that hog
[20:16] will go just as straight to that mud
[20:17] hole as he can
[20:18] go why is because his nature is still a
[20:23] hog and that's the reason that church
[20:25] members today indulge in the things of
[20:27] the world
[20:29] see is because their nature hasn't been
[20:32] changed they'll eat any kind of a
[20:35] ecclesiastical theological sloth that's
[20:38] right but the word of God they can't
[20:41] stand it they'll go in and listen to the
[20:45] word you know the biggest hypocrite in
[20:47] the world is a old
[20:50] crow in the Bible there were two let out
[20:53] of the Ark the old crow went out and he
[20:55] never did return because he's a vulture
[20:59] a scavenger he set on the bodies of the
[21:02] dead carcasses and filled his belly with
[21:04] the dead carcass but when he turned the
[21:07] dove out the dove could not stand that
[21:10] stench so she returned back to Father's
[21:13] house and Noah and beat at the door
[21:16] until Noah let her in now a crow can s
[21:20] out are and eat on a dead horse all day
[21:23] and fly out there in the field and eat
[21:24] grain with a dove but a dove cannot fly
[21:28] over there eat on the dead horse and
[21:29] then eat grain it to kill him see the
[21:32] dove don't have any
[21:34] Gall and he can't
[21:37] digested and when any Dove of God any
[21:42] word eaten Dove or sheep a clean beast
[21:47] when you go to give them the things of
[21:48] the world they know their master that he
[21:51] that loves a world of the things of the
[21:52] world the love of God's not even in him
[21:54] you give him something contrary to that
[21:56] word of God he cannot stand it amen but
[21:59] the devil can take that in the world too
[22:01] and call it all
[22:04] God you can't mix oil and water it just
[22:08] won't
[22:10] mix they all these Shepherds they knew
[22:14] the Sheep was helpless without the
[22:16] shepherd and they were shepherds and
[22:18] knew that he must be guided what a Pity
[22:22] it is the seed that a that they try to
[22:25] feed sheep slop but but a sheep won't
[22:29] eat it no
[22:31] sir see they was trying to feed sheep
[22:34] back there slop and when the word come
[22:37] they've been so used to slop they didn't
[22:39] know the word that's what it is today
[22:42] when the same thing Vindicated and prove
[22:44] that God would do a certain thing then
[22:46] they s used to slop and slop fed to you
[22:49] well there no talking to them they just
[22:50] won't listen to it that's all the dog
[22:54] Bible said as a dog returns to its vomit
[22:56] and a hog to its Waller so to they hear
[23:00] the word and go back right through the
[23:01] same old water and say oh it's
[23:03] fanaticism don't believe such a thing as
[23:06] that God
[23:08] sheep uh does the same today they must
[23:11] trust in the word diet they will not
[23:14] take any other diet you can't give them
[23:16] an ecclesiastical diet the real sheep no
[23:19] no you go tell them I look we'll all be
[23:21] together now Jesus prayed that we all
[23:24] might be one you just heard the same
[23:26] thing in Tucson not long ago if days
[23:29] ago but it's a lie Jesus never prayed
[23:33] how do he how can you make the word
[23:35] condemn itself backfire on itself then
[23:38] God's more than any other
[23:40] man Jesus said how can two walk together
[23:43] L they be agreed how you go take
[23:45] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic
[23:47] and throw it all together and be one you
[23:49] might be one under a man's head but
[23:51] Jesus said that they might be one even
[23:53] as as I and you are one now he wants us
[23:58] all to be one in him which is the word
[24:01] amen there it is one with the father and
[24:03] the father is the son is the same and
[24:05] it's the same word the word manifested
[24:08] display itself in this day as it did in
[24:10] any other day that you might be one
[24:13] notice he said as the father sent me so
[24:17] sent I you the father that sent him went
[24:20] in him to confirm the word and the same
[24:23] Jesus that sends his people goes in the
[24:25] people that he sends and saying the
[24:28] works that I do shall you do
[24:32] also sure he prayed that we might be one
[24:35] one with him not one with an
[24:38] organization not one with a system but
[24:41] one with God or God in his word is one
[24:44] and Jesus and God was one and you and I
[24:47] and the word must be one that's right we
[24:50] must be one in agreement with the word
[24:52] now what somebody else says is this no
[24:54] private interpretation take it what it
[24:56] says and believe it and God will
[24:57] vindicate it prove that's
[24:59] right you think it's just for disciples
[25:01] only take his word for it go try it once
[25:04] and see you'll find out that it will
[25:06] work for you just the same as he
[25:09] promised yes sir they won't eat on sloth
[25:12] they have to have a sheep died St John
[25:14] 10 declares that my sheep know my
[25:18] voice and if he is the word then what
[25:20] kind of voice does he
[25:22] have my sheep know my voice strangers
[25:24] they will not follow see Jesus said a
[25:27] strange voice they would not follow so
[25:29] his sheep doesn't follow strangers voice
[25:32] they won't follow prophets Shepherds and
[25:36] sheep all testify of the coming now I
[25:39] see the unchanging God in his unchanging
[25:45] plans of his word this day now just
[25:48] think a few minutes the unchanging word
[25:50] now look if if Moses would have come
[25:55] with Noah's message it wouldn't have
[25:56] worked
[25:58] if John the Baptist would have come with
[26:00] Moses message it wouldn't work if Jesus
[26:03] would have come with Moses R Noah's
[26:05] message it wouldn't
[26:06] work and Wesley come with Luther's
[26:09] message it wouldn't work if the
[26:11] Pentecost come with the Wesley message
[26:14] it wouldn't work we just heard that
[26:18] testified now God just keeps moving just
[26:21] watch the word you see where we're
[26:24] at then why should not the Shepherds
[26:27] first announcement if all these prophets
[26:31] all these great men were shepherds then
[26:34] why should God the unchanging one change
[26:37] his method right here and bring it to
[26:40] theologians it was Shepherds the arrival
[26:44] of the perfect lamb the sin offering
[26:47] should come to the shepherd the shepherd
[26:50] knows the Sheep better than anyone else
[26:53] there's no one knows a sheep Like a
[26:55] Shepherd he's trained to it also new
[26:58] knew what kind of food they would eat
[27:00] they he knew what the Sheep would eat
[27:03] and he knows his sheep are what they eat
[27:05] but you see a sheep go out to slop pen
[27:07] and start eating slop you'd say get that
[27:09] scavenger away see amen so God knew
[27:13] where to S them now let us call one of
[27:17] Jehovah's great Shepherd prophets to
[27:20] confirm that God was in these prophets
[27:24] under this sheep skin watch now we will
[27:27] call first Moses let's look at him his
[27:31] ministry will show us Jehovah in his
[27:34] Shepherd Prophet now we'll just take
[27:37] maybe one if we have time for about next
[27:39] 10 minutes we'll take two of them but
[27:40] maybe this one will be all right Moses
[27:44] Jehovah displays himself here in this
[27:47] Shepherd
[27:48] prophet he was given three gifts to
[27:53] vindicate his ministry and calling to
[27:56] the Elders of Israel and to to Pharaoh
[27:59] notice this Shepherd Prophet now he give
[28:03] always His prophets the supernatural
[28:07] sign to vindicate that it was God in
[28:10] them for there cannot be the presence of
[28:13] God without Supernatural things
[28:16] happening never did Jehovah ever appear
[28:19] without Supernatural folling it has to
[28:22] be so he always Vindicated himself that
[28:25] he was with these prophets by confirming
[28:27] what they were prophesying of if it was
[28:29] according to his words now the first the
[28:33] first sign he gave to the this Prophet
[28:36] Shepherd look turn his Rod to a
[28:41] serpent second his hand turned to
[28:44] leprosy third to take water out of the
[28:48] Nile river in Egypt and turn it to blood
[28:51] now he giv him three signs to vindicate
[28:55] to Egypt and also to Israel that he he
[28:58] was God's spoken word am now remember
[29:02] Moses called into
[29:05] creation that's right picked up sand and
[29:08] throw it up in the air and said let
[29:09] fleas come and fleas came so let flies
[29:13] come and flies come let frogs come and
[29:15] frogs come he brought into creation Now
[29:18] a man cannot create but it wasn't man to
[29:21] begin with it was
[29:23] Jehovah and his Prophet Shepherd
[29:29] amen watch the third sign he giving was
[29:33] not related to his
[29:36] occupation nor either was it related to
[29:39] his person his third sign notice the
[29:43] first two signs related to him his and
[29:47] his
[29:48] occupation and they was the only two
[29:51] signs that the Bible says that had a
[29:53] voice the other sign didn't have a voice
[29:57] but the two signs that was given from
[29:59] his own person and to his people had
[30:03] voices but the third sign I notice it
[30:06] was given the sign the third sign was a
[30:09] sign of
[30:10] death water turning to blood if your if
[30:15] your uh if your blood would turn to
[30:17] water then you would die and where
[30:20] there's blood shed blood is a sign of
[30:22] death so it was to Pharaoh the third was
[30:26] to turn the Niles water into blood was
[30:30] to show uh to show uh his message to
[30:35] Pharaoh that our God is God over the
[30:38] Nile over the god of the Nile he's God
[30:42] over everything and he's going to bring
[30:45] death to that Nation that's what the
[30:47] sign of blood
[30:49] was oh my direct sign of death
[30:53] blood but the other two had voices of
[30:56] Prophecy
[30:59] I I hope you're reading now between
[31:00] lines I'm saying it but the other two
[31:03] signs had voices of Prophecy to Israel
[31:08] concerning their
[31:10] future now to you that's up on the
[31:12] mountain not long ago when The Rock was
[31:14] through
[31:16] up now and going he was going to change
[31:22] nature to make it work for them watch
[31:26] the pole watch the serpent watch the Red
[31:29] Sea and whatever that he did now look at
[31:32] that Shepherd's uh gold making a way for
[31:36] them to go that stick that was in the
[31:40] shepherd's
[31:41] hand bypassed every bit of Theology and
[31:45] all the things a priest had said and
[31:47] that Shepherd's Rod LED them right on
[31:49] down through every impossible thing to
[31:52] man when Pharaoh tried to think that the
[31:55] cataracts erupted up in the mountains
[31:56] and thrilled the water then made it turn
[31:59] into blood then God reigned fire out of
[32:01] heaven and he reigned hail out of heaven
[32:04] and he and he reigned Li upon the Earth
[32:06] in everything what did he do by that
[32:09] Shepherd's
[32:11] staff not a a
[32:14] textbook not a theologian idea but a
[32:19] shepherd's staff we're coming to it in a
[32:21] minute a Shepherd staff did it
[32:28] not a a denominational prayer
[32:31] book but a Shepherd staff Shepherd's Rod
[32:36] guiding his sheep making the way clear
[32:40] as they went towards the promised word
[32:44] in the land what a beautiful thing that
[32:47] is today of the shepherd staff
[32:51] today guiding his sheep to the promised
[32:54] land bypassing all Theology and
[32:57] everything else of this world the things
[32:58] of the world the denominations
[33:00] everything opening up the way of proving
[33:02] his word to be the truth the shepherd
[33:04] staff going ahead and notice that same
[33:08] Shepherd staff that was guiding the
[33:11] Sheep you believe that he certainly did
[33:15] guide the Sheep he delivered them out of
[33:17] Egypt with that staff in his hand we can
[33:20] say much more about it but hit the
[33:21] highlights he guided the sheep and sent
[33:25] judgment upon the rejecting of
[33:29] the same staff that become a blessing to
[33:31] one become a curse to the
[33:34] others the same Waters of Noah's
[33:38] preaching that saved him condemned the
[33:41] world the same staff that led Israel to
[33:44] the promised land condemn those who
[33:46] refuse to follow the prophet Shepherd
[33:49] that's right become a stick of judgment
[33:53] nature notice how God speaks in his
[33:55] nature we just had time a old there God
[33:58] speaking his nature we Haven time to
[34:00] prove it
[34:02] but proving later by the brass serpent
[34:07] on the shepherd's sheep go
[34:22] [Music]
