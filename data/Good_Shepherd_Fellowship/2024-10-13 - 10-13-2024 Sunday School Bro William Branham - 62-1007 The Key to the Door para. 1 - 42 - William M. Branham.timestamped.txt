[0:01] [Music]
[0:46] knowing tonight was the communion night
[0:49] I always like if I'm around anywhere to
[0:51] come in on the communion because it's um
[0:56] I think that all Christians should
[0:58] anticipate and taking communion because
[1:01] Jesus said if you eat it not you have no
[1:04] part with me therefore it's a always a
[1:07] grand privilege to to come into the
[1:09] Tabernacle and then tonight brother
[1:11] Neville said he was just a teeny bit
[1:13] horse and and like if I speak to our
[1:16] congregation I told him I'd be delighted
[1:18] to do so I would like to announce also
[1:22] that if tomorrow night is the man's
[1:25] meeting the trustees tomorrow night and
[1:29] the B businessman here at the church on
[1:31] their regular Monday night meeting and
[1:33] they have a decision to make with the
[1:37] contractor I guess you all understand
[1:38] that our our um our papers went through
[1:43] and we are going to be able to build a
[1:44] church and so it goes through and it
[1:47] will probably start this week uh the
[1:49] church starts up this week as far as I
[1:51] know and U they turned us down on it
[1:54] here in Jeffersonville but we went to
[1:55] Indianapolis the state and they give us
[1:58] permission so we're go to build it
[2:00] and so um it starts perhaps this week
[2:02] it'll be known after the meeting
[2:04] tomorrow night and then after the
[2:07] meeting tomorrow night if they do not
[2:09] start this week if something happens a
[2:11] contractor can't start this week he's
[2:13] going to um then start the following
[2:16] week and this coming weekend Saturday
[2:18] night Sunday morning and Sunday night of
[2:21] next week this next coming Saturday and
[2:24] Sunday Lord willing I want to have a a a
[2:27] Triune meeting again like we did a few
[2:29] weeks AG go and um then uh after be
[2:33] that'll be Saturday night and then
[2:35] Sunday morning and then Sunday night
[2:37] this next that be the 13th and 14th of
[2:40] this month and then um some of the
[2:43] Brethren and I are going away uh after
[2:46] that time over to Colorado on a little
[2:48] hunting trip then come back if the
[2:51] Tabernacle when it's finished if it be
[2:53] the will of the Lord I want to take
[2:55] maybe a complete week before I leave
[2:57] again in the meetings and have the seven
[2:59] seals of Revelations just before like we
[3:02] had the seven Church ages now the Seven
[3:05] Seals to follow that and probably in
[3:07] about next two or 3 weeks because I
[3:09] think they claim they with the man that
[3:11] they're going to put on it they can we
[3:13] can build the Tabernacle and have it in
[3:15] about 10 days or 15 something like that
[3:18] then we're going to have seating room
[3:19] here for about twice the people we got
[3:22] or three times maybe more people that's
[3:25] why I was waiting till that time because
[3:27] the last Saturday and Sunday
[3:30] uh it was terrific you know the people
[3:32] stand out here at 2:00 in the afternoon
[3:34] uh to fill the Tabernacle up before the
[3:36] church ever opened up and next morning
[3:38] at 5:00 a nurse lives next door to me
[3:40] coming from up there said there's people
[3:42] just packed all around the Tabernacle at
[3:44] 5:00 in the morning so then the people
[3:46] when they get in there's no place and
[3:48] they get discouraged and they go away
[3:50] and and then those who are standing and
[3:52] piled in the jammed in the aisles they F
[3:55] all cramped up and everything and I see
[3:58] women standing there sweating in all
[3:59] like that and a piration run off of him
[4:02] and some man give up and give his some
[4:04] woman a chair and then he'll stand that
[4:06] his legs are hurt and somebody else give
[4:07] him you know like that it's pitiful and
[4:10] mothers of little sick children and so
[4:12] forth that's bad so we're trying to
[4:14] eliminate that now by building a bigger
[4:17] Tabernacle and we have a nice place for
[4:19] the children sometime and interrupt like
[4:22] little children crying while we're going
[4:23] to have a room for that so the mothers
[4:25] can go in still see the service and be
[4:27] broadcast right into the room and have
[4:29] Sunday School rooms and everything just
[4:31] lined out the way it should be and that
[4:33] if the Lord's willing takes place coming
[4:35] this coming week you all voted 100% on
[4:38] it so we've held right to that see the
[4:41] church is Sovereign what the church says
[4:43] that's what trustees or nobody else the
[4:46] trustees just each one a vote the pastor
[4:48] is just one vote it's the church that
[4:51] it's it's the um democracy of the church
[4:55] the sovereignty of the church the church
[4:57] and whole speaks that's all and we like
[5:00] that because we have no Bishops or
[5:02] hierarchies or overseers or so forth
[5:04] that tell us this that the other it's
[5:06] the holy spirit in the church does the
[5:08] speaking I like that rule and it's very
[5:11] fine and I asked did you all want to
[5:13] wait till we got enough to move the
[5:15] Tabernacle way and build a big church
[5:17] that was on the trustee board and it
[5:18] could not be settled by the trustees and
[5:21] then they asked me as a gentle overseer
[5:22] to come and ask the church so I said now
[5:25] we have enough money uh to uh increase
[5:28] the size of the church and fix it all
[5:30] different and everything and what we had
[5:32] I said now we can do that right away or
[5:34] save her money till we get enough to put
[5:36] the complete Church up new someplace
[5:38] else and we talk a vote on it in the
[5:40] church and it was unanimously voted for
[5:42] to put the church up right now and it's
[5:45] uh just build a bigger church right now
[5:47] and we've stayed right with that and the
[5:49] board here in Jeffersonville turned us
[5:51] down and said we couldn't do it and we
[5:53] went over that and went to Indianapolis
[5:55] and got the state onto it and then they
[5:57] sent back the word that go ahead we had
[5:59] the the RightWay to build it so then the
[6:01] city has nothing to do with it now it's
[6:03] the state has to do it so then we have
[6:05] the permission and the contractor has a
[6:07] the permit in his hand right now and I
[6:09] guess they're ready to start at any time
[6:12] this tomorrow night if the if the
[6:14] contractor says that he wants to start
[6:15] next week then I'll just omit the
[6:17] meetings for the until we come into the
[6:19] seven uh seals and then if uh the
[6:22] contractor can't start next week then
[6:24] the following Sunday Saturday and Sunday
[6:26] I'll have the meeting before leaving and
[6:28] then I was going to have it this Sunday
[6:31] and I found out tonight being communion
[6:33] night so I omitted it this Sunday
[6:35] because such a crowd you can't take
[6:37] communion comfortably and then when we
[6:38] have the bigger church we can
[6:41] now uh we got
[6:44] a oncoming
[6:47] president the um oh you know what I
[6:50] mean it was just delivered to the
[6:53] Hickerson family not long ago and if uh
[6:56] our sister who's a Pianist if she'll
[6:59] come and give us a little card on the
[7:00] piano bring them in if you will or some
[7:03] little song of that type this fine
[7:06] little gentleman and the Hickerson
[7:09] family that's been look for for so long
[7:11] has arrived a very fine little fell and
[7:13] he sure is a jewel to the Hickerson and
[7:16] they're all jewels to us we love them
[7:19] and they're really our brother and
[7:21] sister we're thankful to have this
[7:23] little one born into their family which
[7:26] is absolutely revolutionized the family
[7:29] amen and if they father and mother will
[7:33] bring this little fell now for
[7:36] dedication
[7:37] now the scripture says they brought unto
[7:40] him children infants that he might lay
[7:44] his hand on them and bless them now
[7:47] there's people in the world that believe
[7:49] in what they call infant baptism and
[7:53] that is they take these little fellas
[7:55] and not baptize them at all CU they just
[7:57] sprinkle water on them now
[8:00] we don't find that anywhere in the Bible
[8:03] where they ever did sprinkle anybody
[8:06] adults let alone children and so baptism
[8:10] is a confession that an inward work of
[8:13] Grace has been done and the little
[8:16] infants has no knowledge of sin
[8:21] therefore when Jesus died at the cross
[8:23] he died to take away the sin of the
[8:25] world and when the baby is becomes a
[8:28] human being and bned into this world
[8:31] they have no sin of their own therefore
[8:34] they have no repentance to be done but
[8:37] when that the blood of Jesus Christ
[8:40] takes away that sin of course the baby
[8:42] is born in sin shaped in iniquity comes
[8:45] to the world speaking lies and they're
[8:47] Sinners by nature but the blood of Jesus
[8:50] Christ atones for that but when the baby
[8:53] is comes to the age of accountability
[8:56] and knows what's right and wrong then it
[8:58] has to repent repent for what it has
[9:01] done its sin now is a sin just like it's
[9:04] born in sin it's a human sin the sin now
[9:07] is a sin that Adam and Eve did and that
[9:10] was omitted by God by the blood of Jesus
[9:13] Christ now the baby has no sins to
[9:16] repent from until he sins then he's got
[9:19] to repent see and when he repents then's
[9:23] a time to be baptized and then he's
[9:25] baptized by immersing until that time we
[9:28] follow the instructions of the Bible
[9:30] which they brought to Jesus little
[9:32] children that he might lay his hands on
[9:35] them and bless them this lovely parent
[9:39] tonight brings this little baby to the
[9:43] pastor and I for
[9:45] dedication and they feel that placing it
[9:48] in the representatives of Christ hands
[9:52] they're placing it in Christ hands then
[9:54] by faith we take the baby to God to give
[9:57] thanks for bringing it here and ask God
[9:59] to bless it which we call infant
[10:03] dedication uh you know how to be about
[10:06] my own children I've got a little girl
[10:08] in glory tonight and she was dedicated
[10:11] to the Lord here at the altar I've got a
[10:14] little boy and girl sitting back there
[10:16] tonight has never been baptized yet 11
[10:19] I've been talking to her about it today
[10:20] Sarah for baptism and Joseph is only
[10:24] seven so he's too young for it yet as
[10:26] far until if he desire and say God was
[10:29] put on his heart I'd do it then but as
[10:31] infants I just dedicate him to the Lord
[10:34] cuz that's the scriptural teaching of it
[10:36] nille if you walk out with me now to
[10:49] this
[10:50] St well
[10:53] that's I thought he was
[10:57] sleeping the
[10:59] going
[11:01] on I seen the other day I said the
[11:04] president and so forth for too small for
[11:09] take how do you do I know that's found
[11:13] to be a treasure to any would you think
[11:15] so very sweet and now brother and
[11:19] sisteron as a servant of Christ and your
[11:22] pastor I take this baby by faith to the

[15:50] something here that I might announce
[15:52] that the services if they come up for
[15:55] this next week if I placed them in here

[16:00] what I was going to speak on for the the
[16:03] the coming this coming service of the
[16:06] following week if I I think I thought I
[16:09] put it in this book I don't know whether
[16:11] I did or not yes sure it is the Lord
[16:13] willing Saturday night I want to preach
[16:17] on the subject of
[16:20] the
[16:22] why one man influences another's life
[16:26] and Sunday morning I want to preach on
[16:28] the the capping of the pyramid and
[16:31] Sunday night I want to preach on my
[16:34] guide the subject my guide for this
[16:37] coming Sunday night now may the Lord
[16:40] bless those things and help me as I've
[16:42] been out and just a little context to
[16:45] pick them up now
[16:46] tonight we want to hurry and have a few
[16:49] things by the way I have a letter here
[16:53] that
[16:54] U that just come in the mail as Billy
[16:57] picked it up a while ago that some
[17:00] brethren are in Michigan and this comes
[17:02] from the Ministerial Association that's
[17:05] got a lot of things that's what gets
[17:07] things scrupled up you see that they're
[17:09] claiming here that some brethren up
[17:10] there that said that I sent them up
[17:12] there and they're preaching that man
[17:14] should leave their wives and hunt for
[17:16] their spiritual mate and that um that I
[17:20] am perfectly infallible that there's
[17:22] nothing and what was some of the awest
[17:24] things you ever heard and the
[17:26] Ministerial Association got a hold of it
[17:28] and they're writing me a letter about it
[17:31] and um I sent them up there and it's
[17:34] causing a lot of confusion and some of
[17:37] them prophesying and saying that one man
[17:39] should leave this wife and go marry that
[17:40] one uh this church knows that we don't
[17:42] stand for No Such Tommy Rod as that we
[17:45] believe in the Bible we believe that
[17:47] when man takes a woman that's his wife
[17:49] and death only can separate him that's
[17:52] only we don't believe such stuff as that
[17:54] we don't believe in free love either we
[17:56] don't believe in that stuff we
[17:58] absolutely believe the Bible and that
[18:00] alone amen so I'll just photostatic copy
[18:03] of this letter and give my answer to it
[18:05] and place it in the magazines and
[18:07] that'll that'll take care of that I hope
[18:09] it does anyhow answer to them now
[18:12] tonight just before we open the
[18:15] scripture let's speak to our Lord our
[18:18] heavenly father we are approaching thy
[18:22] Throne of Mercy In The Name Of The Lord
[18:25] Jesus that great one who came down from
[18:29] glory to unfold to us the riches of the
[18:32] treasures of God how we thank thee for
[18:36] this great
[18:37] Jesus who was the manifestation of God
[18:42] made personally to us and through him we
[18:45] have Redemption from our sins and we
[18:49] have now passed from Death un life
[18:52] because we believe him for it is written
[18:55] of him that he said he that heareth my
[18:58] words and believeth on him it sent he
[19:00] has everlasting life and shall not come
[19:03] to the Judgment but pass from Death unto
[19:06] life bless th words tonight Lord and
[19:08] we're here to take the communion just in
[19:11] a short time Christian Fellow citizens
[19:15] of the Kingdom will gather around the
[19:20] altars and there they will take what we
[19:23] call the communion the the little potion
[19:27] of of sacri that thou has left us to
[19:30] show that we believe that you died for
[19:34] our sins and rose again on the third day
[19:37] and a lie forever more and doing this
[19:40] until you return according to the
[19:43] scriptures as we are commanded sanctify
[19:46] our hearts from Evil thoughts and all
[19:49] that we have did that was contrary to
[19:52] thy great will father forgive us and
[19:55] give us of thy Grace tonight break unto
[19:58] us now the the bread of life in the word
[20:00] as we read it and speak on it in the
[20:03] name of the Lord Jesus we ask it
[20:08] amen now in the Book of
[20:11] Revelations uh beginning with one verse
[20:15] only I wish to read the 20th verse or
[20:19] the first verse of the 20th chapter and
[20:22] I saw an angel come down from heaven
[20:26] having a key of the the bottomless
[20:30] pit and a great chain in his
[20:34] hand now I wish to speak if it would be
[20:39] if I should call it the text from this
[20:43] or draw a context from this text for the
[20:47] next 20 or 25 minutes I would like to
[20:51] call it the key to the
[20:55] door now I do not wish to to make it the
[21:01] keys because Peter was given the keys to
[21:05] the kingdom but I want to call this the
[21:08] key to the
[21:11] door and then immediately after this I
[21:13] wish to give a few little comments on
[21:16] communion before we take it tonight now
[21:20] a
[21:22] key I notice here as we read that this
[21:26] angel came down from from Heaven having
[21:30] the key in his
[21:32] hand I believe it's Revelations 13 or 19
[21:37] we find again another angel coming with
[21:41] a
[21:42] key and a key is a purpose of a key is
[21:48] to unlock
[21:50] something something that's been locked
[21:54] up or it's something that should be
[21:57] locked up
[22:00] but a key is given for that purpose now
[22:04] there are many kinds of keys because we
[22:08] have many uses of keys there's keys to
[22:13] the storehouses there's key to your own
[22:15] house there's key to your
[22:18] automobile and uh we call them keys and
[22:23] they are
[22:24] keys and they can be duplicated many
[22:28] times s or to the house are sometimes
[22:31] can be made what we call the skeleton
[22:35] key and other words it's a key that's
[22:38] kind of uh made with the levers uh acts
[22:43] on it that that twists the lock in a
[22:45] certain way can almost unlock any door
[22:48] called The Skeleton Key it's a skeleton
[22:53] frame of many
[22:56] keys and it can be unlocked that way
[23:00] with our houses or even to our
[23:02] automobiles can be
[23:05] duplicated and then there is any
[23:09] key cannot unlock no door until it's
[23:15] used by a
[23:17] hand it's got to have something to use
[23:21] the key the key in itself cannot use
[23:27] itself it's got to have something to
[23:31] yield the key it's like this microphone
[23:35] that I I'm speaking through that
[23:38] microphone is a
[23:40] mute unless there's something to speak
[23:43] through it it cannot speak through
[23:47] itself it's got to have something to
[23:50] speak through it so it is not the
[23:53] microphone it's the voice or the the
[23:56] noise behind that the microphone
[24:00] transmits to the Air wave to your
[24:03] ear now that's the way it is in
[24:06] preaching the gospel it's not the uh we
[24:10] ourselves as ministers we are not the
[24:13] gospel but we are only
[24:17] transmitters that transmits the voice of
[24:21] God through our agency of man to the
[24:26] hearer amen a vision is the same way uh
[24:30] I know nothing to say to the church at
[24:32] this time concerning a vision but if the
[24:35] Holy Spirit would show first me a vision
[24:39] then I transmit that Vision to the one
[24:44] that is directed to so it was not my me
[24:49] the vision was not me I it was God gave
[24:53] the vision and I acted as a transmitter
[24:56] to bring forth the message of the vision
[24:59] to the people now a key is the same
[25:02] thing pardon me the
[25:04] key is only to be held in a hand that
[25:09] unlocks the door see it's got to be hand
[25:13] now and in the key I'm going to speak
[25:17] about tonight is only one hand can hold
[25:21] this key and that's the hand of Faith
[25:24] it's the only thing can can hold this
[25:27] key and hands hold other keys and it
[25:31] takes a hand of faith for that now we
[25:34] take like the key to
[25:36] knowledge now a man has to if he's
[25:40] trying to accumulate knowledge see now
[25:44] there's a key to that there's a way that
[25:47] this man has to open up he has to be to
[25:52] get his books and his learning and he
[25:55] cannot no one can learn him they might
[25:57] teach him but he has to learn and the
[26:00] only way that it can be done he has to
[26:02] catch that key that's something in there
[26:07] that unfolds or un reveals to him the
[26:12] knowledge that he is
[26:14] seeking and there are people like would
[26:17] try to play a piano and they are music
[26:21] they don't know just how to do it but
[26:23] they could go there and the teacher
[26:26] might take lesson after lesson and they
[26:29] never learn it they just cannot hold
[26:33] that key to that mystery how the Rhythm
[26:36] and the sounds of the tuning and so
[26:39] forth rings out it takes the key
[26:48] [Music]
