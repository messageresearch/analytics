[40:21] sweet sweet Holy Spirit praise the Lord
[40:23] amen and uh how many of you young people
[40:28] turn into the youth meeting this uh this
[40:31] afternoon

[40:39] amen praise the Lord it was it was
[40:41] wonderful
[40:43] it was wonderful thank you for
[40:44] participating
[40:46] and I think
[40:50] for the beginning that was it was very
[40:53] impressive
[40:54] it was very impressive if you if you
[40:57] were in that Tony and you you missed a
[41:00] whole lot
[41:02] and now uh
[41:06] you know uh
[41:08] youth meeting is just it's just it's
[41:10] just a title I would say just like
[41:12] brother Harry Beckett in Cape Town South
[41:14] Africa he says the Rapture is a Nintendo
[41:18] youth meeting right yeah praise the Lord
[41:21] amen this is the rapture it's an eternal
[41:25] youth meeting
[41:26] and so
[41:27] youth meeting is is just it's just a
[41:30] title that we that we pulled over there
[41:34] but uh is is the word of God
[41:37] amen and uh and because it's the word of
[41:41] God there is just no subject in the word
[41:45] of God that you are ordered in
[41:48] to think that no it's just for young
[41:51] people that's a misunderstanding and
[41:54] especially you parents
[41:57] is good for you to follow
[42:01] praise the Lord I've seen many parents
[42:03] comes from youth meeting and then they
[42:06] get they get uh you know a little bit
[42:10] upset because their child is saying
[42:12] something this is I don't know even what
[42:13] they are teaching you don't know what
[42:15] they are teaching go there and know
[42:17] right
[42:18] because it might not be the teacher
[42:21] it might just be the child that
[42:23] misunderstand what he said
[42:25] sure
[42:26] praise the Lord
[42:28] so I think that was that was a good stat

[48:41] but I love the Lord I love his word and
[48:43] so uh so I enjoy the Mysteries but I
[48:46] having times tried to teach those myself
[48:49] sometimes those things get confusing so
[48:52] I finally keep my gift where God placed
[48:54] it and that's the simple things
[48:56] and the brothers that know how to fly
[48:58] their way and take it I'd pray for him
[48:59] and said thank the Lord for him and I
[49:01] just care to keep minding where he
[49:03] placed me and we work together and keep
[49:04] it balanced
[49:06] so uh so thank God for his grace his
[49:10] mercy and the opportunity to be here
[49:11] tonight so not grow up alone a time if
[49:14] you have your Bibles I'm going to invite
[49:15] you to determine the book of Romans
[49:17] the eighth chapter
[49:19] and I just ask that you pray for me
[49:23] and uh
[49:26] give me an about attention for about 45
[49:27] minutes per hour maybe somewhere along
[49:29] in there
[49:30] I have the long should lead sometimes a
[49:32] little shorter sometimes a little longer
[49:34] but we committed to him
[49:36] and uh and if I say something that maybe
[49:39] doesn't quite seem correct to you then I
[49:42] sincerely say chocolate to migrants
[49:44] pray for the preacher
[49:46] put that aside but keep eating because I
[49:50] believe there'd be something good on the
[49:51] table
[49:52] there's something good on the table
[49:54] if you have your Bibles look at Romans
[49:55] the 8th chapter verse 28
[49:58] and before we read I'll ask you to buy
[50:00] you hit me forward of Prayer

[50:17] far
[50:18] we've been treated very well
[50:20] tonight the purpose for coming Lord is
[50:23] as much as we love the fellowship was
[50:25] not so much to Fellowship
[50:27] the Lord there's a will of God to be
[50:28] done
[50:30] Lord there's no way a man can do it in
[50:32] the self even understand what it is to
[50:34] be done
[50:36] Lord that'll take you
[50:38] forgive us of our sins me chiefly
[50:40] God use the service For Your Glory we
[50:42] ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[50:46] Romans the eighth chapter
[50:50] one verse
[50:54] and it says
[50:56] and we know
[50:58] that means there's a security you say I
[51:01] know something this is Surety
[51:03] we know we are sure that all things work
[51:06] together
[51:08] for good
[51:09] to them love God
[51:11] to them who are the called
[51:13] according to his purpose it's about it's
[51:15] once again
[51:16] dear Lord we thank you once again for
[51:18] the reading of your word
[51:20] Lord used to give speak to your people
[51:23] we actually give you thanks in Jesus
[51:25] Christ's name amen amen you may be
[51:27] seated
[51:29] now after my long
[51:31] introduction about I don't
[51:34] consider myself a teacher that goes out
[51:36] in a deep things
[51:38] my title of night is the mystery of
[51:40] redemption
[51:41] the Mr Redemption
[51:44] and I don't call it a misredemption
[51:47] because I plan on making this very
[51:48] mysterious
[51:50] I call it a mystery Redemption because
[51:52] redemption in itself is a mystery amen
[51:55] you understand
[51:56] just like the godhead in itself is a
[51:59] mystery so it's not that I'm planning on
[52:01] making it some great swelling words of
[52:03] Mystery but the topic in itself is a
[52:06] mystery and the reason it's not a
[52:08] mystery is tonight is because by God's
[52:10] grace he sent an angel Messenger to
[52:12] unfold the Mysteries
[52:15] amen so the mystery tonight my title is
[52:17] the mystery of redemption
[52:20] what is redemption
[52:22] let's just take a look at how the
[52:23] prophet explains it
[52:25] let's see how simply makes this
[52:26] Redemption
[52:28] in a message paradox
[52:30] brother Brown says Joshua here is a book
[52:34] actually it is the book of redemption of
[52:36] the Old Testament
[52:38] just we have to consider it to be that
[52:40] the book of redemption
[52:42] because its Redemption has two parts
[52:45] Redemption anywhere has two parts now I
[52:48] like this no matter whether we're
[52:49] talking about spiritual Redemption we're
[52:51] talking about natural things that are
[52:52] being redeemed Redemption anywhere by
[52:55] its definition for the Ramses has two
[52:56] parts amen he said that is out of and I
[53:00] want you to catch this it's very
[53:01] important for tonight out of and into
[53:05] he said it takes two parts to make
[53:06] Redemption out of and into it goes on to
[53:11] explain how the Old Testament was a type
[53:13] of redemption
[53:15] he said Moses represented the law which
[53:18] brought them out of Egypt
[53:20] and whereas Joshua represented Grace
[53:22] that took them into the promised land so
[53:25] you see there had to be a coming out of
[53:27] and then there had to be something that
[53:30] takes them into to be Redemption just
[53:32] coming out of Egypt was not Redemption
[53:34] there had to be something to complete
[53:36] the process and the process wasn't
[53:37] completed about coming out the process
[53:39] was completed by the act of going in
[53:42] so he said I called Joshua the book of
[53:44] redemption because Joshua's where it was
[53:46] completed Moses did the first half he
[53:48] brought them out but Joshua completed
[53:50] their Redemption because he was the
[53:52] Angel God used to take them in Now You
[53:54] Follow Me
[53:55] so it means come out of one condition or
[53:58] one order and to go into another
[54:01] because the two conditions listen cannot
[54:03] coexist at the same time you can be in
[54:07] this condition and in that condition at
[54:09] the same time brother Brown said there's
[54:11] no such thing as a sober drunk man you
[54:13] can be a drunk man and be a soul man at
[54:15] the same time you got to come out of the
[54:17] space for being drunk in order to truly
[54:19] be in the state or being sober or you
[54:21] follow me so there has to be two farts
[54:23] and the two parts cannot coexist at the
[54:25] same time the Church of Israel could not
[54:27] come out or live in Egypt watch this
[54:29] they could not in live in Egypt and at
[54:32] the same time enjoy the flowing milk and
[54:35] honey in the promised land in order to
[54:38] enjoy the floor and milk and honey they
[54:40] had to first come out before they could
[54:43] go in to enjoy it to others so you farm
[54:45] you see what I'm getting at Redemption
[54:46] has two parts two different places and
[54:49] two different conditions that was the
[54:51] Redemption of Israel God's natural
[54:53] Sunrise was in type and so is it with
[54:56] God's spiritual sons and daughter us
[54:58] this New Testament Church we have to be
[55:00] willing and able to make a change in
[55:02] order to be The Heirs of redemption now
[55:04] Redemption listen that's only one part
[55:08] of the Redemption when we talk about out
[55:09] of and into that's one part of it I want
[55:11] you to watch how brother Brandon brings
[55:13] another part of redemption in and
[55:14] Redemption also means to restore it
[55:17] means to put back in the hands or the
[55:19] rightful owner so why Redemption has two
[55:22] parts out of and into the actual meaning
[55:25] of the word means to restore Now watch
[55:28] how brother bam describes this in a
[55:30] message who is this Melchizedek
[55:32] he said the predestinated is the only
[55:34] one that's considered in the Redemption
[55:37] now we're going to get to that in just a
[55:39] minute he said did you get it he said
[55:40] let me say that again the predestinator
[55:43] is the only one that's considering the
[55:44] Redemption
[55:45] people might be making like or thinking
[55:47] they are but now watch this but the real
[55:50] Redemption is to those that are
[55:52] predestinated because the very word
[55:54] redeemed marriage get into the
[55:56] definition the very word redeemed means
[55:58] to bring back
[56:00] now I'm not getting into the deepness of
[56:02] predestination so kind of relax a little
[56:04] bit that's not my point but I want you
[56:06] to catch this very point he said the
[56:08] very Act of redemption means to bring
[56:10] back is that right he said the redeem is
[56:13] something to redeem anything is to bring
[56:16] it back to its original place so now
[56:18] watch this we're coming out of and we're
[56:21] going in too but what are we coming out
[56:23] of we're coming out of one condition to
[56:25] go back to its original place
[56:27] or you'll follow me so if we just stay
[56:30] out of the oven into out of what and
[56:31] into what Redemption means you're going
[56:33] out of one condition and you're going
[56:35] back to an original place and I want you
[56:38] to watch this he said Hallelujah he said
[56:41] so it's owning a predestined it'll be
[56:42] brought back because the others didn't
[56:44] come from there he said see he said to
[56:47] bring back so now in order for Israel to
[56:50] go to the promised land get this there
[56:52] had to be some seed that placed them in
[56:55] their land before they can ever go back
[56:57] or you follow me now I want you to watch
[56:58] this so in order for them to come out of
[57:00] Egypt and go into Promised Land there
[57:02] had to be something that connected him
[57:04] to the land before they ever got there
[57:06] and I want you to watch this they came
[57:08] out of Egypt as the people to enter into
[57:10] Palestine but that country of Palestine
[57:12] listened was the same country that was
[57:15] once promised to their father Abraham so
[57:17] the son that was going to Israel was
[57:19] only going back to the land that was
[57:20] promised to their father Abraham while
[57:22] you're watching this they left listen
[57:24] they left the land and they left the
[57:26] land in the days of Jacob there was a
[57:28] land the time that God had given to
[57:30] Abraham and the Isaac and Jacob they
[57:31] left the land of Jacob and they went
[57:33] down to Egypt but in order to be
[57:35] redeemed they were only going back
[57:37] listen to the same land it wasn't a
[57:40] different land it wasn't a different
[57:42] promise it's just a different time why
[57:44] in a different generation that was being
[57:46] redeemed out of one country going back
[57:48] into the country that they should have
[57:50] been in they entire I want to say it
[57:52] again they should have been in the
[57:54] entire time
[57:57] you see you and I are included as part
[57:59] of God's Redemption we're in his hands
[58:01] tonight
[58:02] I heard a brother say we're serving a
[58:04] living savior we're in his hands tonight
[58:06] and guess what we should have been in
[58:08] his hands the entire time but there was
[58:11] something that took us away it was
[58:12] called a fall of the garden but
[58:14] Redemption is to bring you back and to
[58:16] the power of the hand you should have
[58:17] been in the entire time
[58:21] now watch this sister take Jacob's seed
[58:23] back to the same land in the Book of
[58:25] Genesis chapter 15 verse 7 it goes like
[58:28] this and he said unto him I am the Lord
[58:31] that brought thee out of Earth
[58:33] accordions God's speaking to Abraham I
[58:36] brought thee out of the Earth the
[58:37] Chaldeans to give thee this land to
[58:40] inherit it so God had Abraham standing
[58:43] in a place he had called him out of one
[58:45] place and he brought him into listening
[58:47] to the Palestine and he said I've given
[58:49] you this land for you to inherit it I
[58:52] want you to watch this and he said unto
[58:54] the Lord whereby shall I know that I
[58:56] shall inherit in other words can you
[58:57] give me a sign that I could have
[58:59] confidence that this inheritance is mine
[59:01] he said now watch the sign he gave them
[59:03] the sign he gave Abraham was a sacrifice
[59:07] how do I know that I'm going to be
[59:09] brought back to my inheritance God Gave
[59:11] Me A Sign it was a man that hung on the
[59:13] cross it was a sacrifice
[59:15] it wasn't by Abraham's work he was going
[59:17] to get this land but it was by the
[59:20] sacrifice he was to put his confidence
[59:22] because the sacrifice became a covenant
[59:25] between man and between God and this
[59:28] sacrifices my Covenant that God made to
[59:30] me and said I make your promise brother
[59:31] Holloway that by the sacrifice I'm going
[59:34] to bring you back to where you belong
[59:36] so in our good days I'm happy in my bad
[59:39] days I'm happy why it's not me that
[59:41] matters It's My Sacrifice
[59:45] and I want you to watch this and he said
[59:47] unto him
[59:48] take me a heifer of three years old
[59:51] and if she go to three years old all
[59:53] these type in Christ in a rama three
[59:55] years old and a turtle dove and a young
[59:57] pigeon and he took them on he took unto
[1:00:00] him all these and divided him in the
[1:00:02] midst and laid them each piece one
[1:00:04] against another but the birds are
[1:00:06] divided not and when the files came down
[1:00:08] upon the carcass Abram drove them away
[1:00:10] and when the sun was going down a deep
[1:00:13] sleep fell upon Abram and lower horror
[1:00:16] of great Darkness fell upon him and God
[1:00:18] said unto Abram no other surety that thy
[1:00:22] seed shall be a stranger in a land that
[1:00:25] is not theirs now I want you to watch
[1:00:27] this he just told him I give you this
[1:00:29] land he said but Abraham you're going to
[1:00:32] need Redemption you're not you but your
[1:00:33] seed is gonna need Redemption why I'm
[1:00:35] going to tell you even though I give you
[1:00:36] this land to you and your seat after you
[1:00:39] they're going to leave this land and
[1:00:41] they're going to go into a land of a
[1:00:42] stranger that's not theirs but watch
[1:00:44] this watch what he says he said and they
[1:00:46] shall serve them and they shall afflict
[1:00:49] in 400 years and also that Nation whom
[1:00:52] they Shall Serve I will judge and after
[1:00:55] what they should come out and with great
[1:00:57] substance and thou shall go to be with
[1:00:59] our fathers in peace and thou shall be
[1:01:01] buried in good old days but listen but
[1:01:03] in the fourth generation they shall come
[1:01:05] hither again Redemption the same land
[1:01:08] that you're standing on that I'm
[1:01:10] promising to you there's going to be a
[1:01:11] generation of seed after you that's
[1:01:13] going to come back and stand in the same
[1:01:15] land and possess the land that you're
[1:01:17] not living in
[1:01:20] so they have to come out of wet land of
[1:01:22] strangers in order to enter back into
[1:01:24] something that they should have
[1:01:26] possessed the entire time that's
[1:01:28] Redemption
[1:01:29] they were going to a Strange Land
[1:01:32] that I did not promise them
[1:01:34] I never said they had to go to Egypt I
[1:01:36] said they would
[1:01:39] I never said it had to but they would
[1:01:41] but because they would I promise to
[1:01:44] bring them back
[1:01:45] so after 400 years they should come out
[1:01:48] and enter into this place that have
[1:01:50] promised them now watch this but in the
[1:01:52] fourth generation they should come
[1:01:53] hither again not to a new land here
[1:01:57] hither right here again Redemption
[1:02:00] coming back to the same place back to
[1:02:03] the same land now how does this apply to
[1:02:05] you and I today
[1:02:06] let's look at my title again
[1:02:09] my title is to miss Redemption
[1:02:12] but my sub topic is call for a purpose
[1:02:17] my title is the mystery of redemption
[1:02:21] my subtitle has called for a purpose
[1:02:24] God called Israel out of Egypt to
[1:02:27] establish them at a certain land listen
[1:02:29] for a certain purpose
[1:02:31] that purpose was that they might serve
[1:02:34] him
[1:02:35] for 400 years they knew what it was like
[1:02:38] to serve pharaoh
[1:02:40] they did not know what it's like to
[1:02:42] serve God
[1:02:44] but God's Redemption was not to bring
[1:02:46] them out to serve him the same way that
[1:02:48] served Pharaoh they serve pharaoh and
[1:02:50] fear they serve Pharaoh with task
[1:02:51] Masters God didn't want them to serve
[1:02:53] him that way God wanted to serve him but
[1:02:55] you have to learn what it's like to
[1:02:57] serve a living God
[1:02:59] so God wants them to come out to serve
[1:03:02] him watch What God Says in the book of
[1:03:03] Exodus chapter 8 verse one and the Lord
[1:03:05] God speaking of Moses go on the Pharaoh
[1:03:08] and send to him thus said the Lord let
[1:03:10] my people go that they might serve me
[1:03:13] say any Redemption not everyone will
[1:03:16] come back to a land but they came back
[1:03:18] to a land for a purpose
[1:03:20] they were called out of Egypt for a
[1:03:23] purpose yes if they only came out it was
[1:03:26] in the wilderness and didn't recognize
[1:03:27] their purpose they missed the call of
[1:03:29] redemption but the real Revelation was
[1:03:31] not just to come out but to recognize
[1:03:33] I'm a free man and I've been called now
[1:03:35] for a purpose
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:40] you were not called out by Malachi 4 for
[1:03:43] wander
[1:03:44] we were not called out just to be
[1:03:46] another movement but every one of us
[1:03:48] tonight that have received this Malachi
[1:03:50] 4 call God called you
[1:03:53] for purpose
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:57] and that purpose is a part of your
[1:03:58] Redemption
[1:03:59] You See Redemption was not only bring
[1:04:01] them back to their inheritance but God
[1:04:03] was bringing the people back to his own
[1:04:06] inheritance
[1:04:07] the people belong listen not to pharaoh
[1:04:11] you and I don't belong to this world
[1:04:13] but we have Redeemed by price in order
[1:04:18] to fulfill God's purpose
[1:04:21] Paul put it this way in First
[1:04:22] Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19. Paul
[1:04:25] says what know he not that your body is
[1:04:27] the temple
[1:04:29] of the Holy Ghost which is in you you
[1:04:32] know now watch this
[1:04:34] Israel was called back to that land
[1:04:37] to dwell with God
[1:04:39] right there was a tabernacle that was
[1:04:41] established in that land
[1:04:43] and that Tabernacle was the place in
[1:04:45] which they would have come and
[1:04:46] fellowship with their God and offer
[1:04:48] sacrifice and bring Thanksgiving and
[1:04:50] tell God how good he was for bringing
[1:04:52] him out of Egypt they were to Fellowship
[1:04:54] listen with God and that lamb and the
[1:04:57] real belief of the day was not called
[1:04:58] out of the world just to wander but
[1:05:00] we're going to come back into the same
[1:05:02] Fellowship that Adam had in the Garden
[1:05:04] of Eden God wants you not to have the
[1:05:06] same Fellowship back with God again amen
[1:05:08] Adam was not afraid of God when God came
[1:05:11] down animals looking forward to the
[1:05:13] presence of God
[1:05:17] and in Redemption we've been restored
[1:05:18] back side Fellowship Fellowship not the
[1:05:21] fear of the law but the power of Grace
[1:05:25] to know God is redeeming for a purpose
[1:05:28] Paulson knowing that your body's the
[1:05:29] Temple of the Holy Ghost which he have
[1:05:31] of God listen and ye are not your
[1:05:34] but he had been brought with a
[1:05:39] you see in the Redemption God paid the
[1:05:41] price to bring Israel out of Egypt
[1:05:44] but not just to being a promised man to
[1:05:46] do what they wanted to God said I'm
[1:05:48] calling to this promised land that they
[1:05:50] might serve me
[1:05:52] there was a real purpose for God
[1:05:55] creating that Nation he wanted the
[1:05:57] people that was going to be separated
[1:05:58] from all of the Nations not to follow a
[1:06:00] law of per se but to worship God and
[1:06:03] true Holiness recognizing that they had
[1:06:05] a redeemer that could bring them out
[1:06:07] and they were not to mingle with the
[1:06:09] rest of the world and watch this
[1:06:11] but you're not your own but you've been
[1:06:12] brought with a price therefore listen
[1:06:14] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:06:17] spirits which are
[1:06:19] are you following me you've been called
[1:06:22] and redeemed for a purpose
[1:06:25] see a Satan can keep our minds down to a
[1:06:28] certain level
[1:06:29] we all make mistakes
[1:06:31] as long as you got breath in your body
[1:06:34] you're gonna have them yeah
[1:06:36] he said but you shouldn't judge yourself
[1:06:37] by your mistakes he said judge yourself
[1:06:39] by the desire in your heart what you
[1:06:41] desire to do for God he said in the
[1:06:43] blood of Christ takes care of everything
[1:06:45] else but see saying keeps us so low that
[1:06:48] I'm not worried that our Lord knows I'm
[1:06:50] not I'm not worthy to get in the plane
[1:06:51] to fly to Charlotte to come to me the
[1:06:53] answers to speak to this group I'm not
[1:06:54] worried that but for some reason for
[1:06:56] some purpose I gotta get beyond my own
[1:06:59] sight of myself and say Lord what are
[1:07:01] you doing
[1:07:01] can you use this Crystal and vegetable
[1:07:04] Clay is there something you're doing for
[1:07:05] the Holloway that's going to help our
[1:07:07] people and meaning if it's just one can
[1:07:09] you do it Lord if you can yield yourself
[1:07:11] to me
[1:07:15] these little boys sitting here in the
[1:07:16] front row
[1:07:17] tonight to be used to God
[1:07:20] I don't care what they know what they
[1:07:21] don't know I don't care where they've
[1:07:23] been and where they hadn't been if the
[1:07:25] Holy Spirit could get a hold of one of
[1:07:26] these boys tonight he could do more than
[1:07:28] boys that he could do with any other
[1:07:29] person in this building if you need to
[1:07:30] hold his boys because why it is not the
[1:07:33] power of the vessel but it's the power
[1:07:34] that's able to work in the vessel
[1:07:38] did more in David than he can do his
[1:07:40] entire Army of Israel why he had one
[1:07:42] little boy that the Holy Ghost could
[1:07:44] hold up and what are gonna do he can
[1:07:46] destroy Army that the army of Israel
[1:07:48] couldn't touch
[1:07:50] because of what God can do and he gets a
[1:07:52] hold of a person
[1:07:53] now I want you to watch this
[1:07:56] God called you for a purpose let the
[1:07:59] Holy Spirit have you for that amen let
[1:08:01] me keep going
[1:08:03] see our purpose there's a purpose by
[1:08:05] which we recall
[1:08:06] we have been separated from the world
[1:08:08] not to relax
[1:08:10] but to find and to fulfill the purpose
[1:08:13] in which we were called out for this age
[1:08:16] and I called out for another age but for
[1:08:19] call now why did God redeem me call me
[1:08:21] out of the world to bring me back to
[1:08:24] himself just like he called Israel out
[1:08:25] of Egypt to bring him back to himself
[1:08:27] why did God want to call Michael
[1:08:28] Holloway out to himself in this age
[1:08:31] let me keep going
[1:08:34] the first step listen
[1:08:36] in this Redemption
[1:08:38] if we must recognize
[1:08:40] the place that we're living listen was
[1:08:43] not where God ordained us to be
[1:08:46] you see in order to be redeemed you have
[1:08:48] to want to get out of that condition
[1:08:51] you take a man as happy in the world
[1:08:53] leaving there
[1:08:55] said brother how well you just said a
[1:08:56] big thing I just I did leave him there
[1:08:58] brother Brandon saw a man one time when
[1:09:00] Billy Paula backslid and Billy Paul was
[1:09:02] sitting in church and they had altar
[1:09:03] called the man came to build upon tab on
[1:09:05] the back and said Billy Paul don't want
[1:09:06] to go to the Altar and burn down to that
[1:09:07] man don't you touch my son again right
[1:09:09] he said you leaving right there to God
[1:09:11] calls him because if there's not
[1:09:13] something in his heart where he's ready
[1:09:14] to change you're wasting your time
[1:09:16] praying to the altar you see Jesus
[1:09:18] Christ to say coming to me the world he
[1:09:20] said come unto me all you that labor and
[1:09:22] I want heavy lady there's got to be
[1:09:24] something in the man heart that's ready
[1:09:26] for a change
[1:09:27] even though Israel was going to be in
[1:09:29] the Redemption God had to raise the
[1:09:31] Pharaoh that knew not Joseph because as
[1:09:33] long as they have metals and leaks they
[1:09:35] were happy but when the Taskmaster
[1:09:36] started beating them and taking down a
[1:09:38] bridge they said Lord get us out of here
[1:09:41] there's got to be something in the man
[1:09:43] that's reading for attemption
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:48] the man's happy in the world in there
[1:09:50] oh that man could be Christ said brother
[1:09:52] I'm tired I'm tired cigarettes I'm tired
[1:09:55] now you got something to work with
[1:09:58] nothing
[1:10:03] is wrong he's never I love my past I
[1:10:05] love my church then stay there but when
[1:10:07] that man starts saying brother something
[1:10:09] wrong I ain't happy I ain't getting fed
[1:10:11] my soul is hungry now you got something
[1:10:13] to work with
[1:10:14] you can offer them a better way he's
[1:10:16] ready to come out of that condition to
[1:10:19] enter into a better condition
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:23] now watch this
[1:10:25] no matter how a person
[1:10:28] if he's happy in a certain condition
[1:10:30] there's not a whole lot you can do
[1:10:33] but once that person recognizes I'm not
[1:10:35] satisfied anymore
[1:10:37] I'm not said now now you're dealing with
[1:10:39] a soul that the Holy Ghost is brewing on
[1:10:42] you follow me that on the happiness
[1:10:44] because now they were happy in the world
[1:10:46] for 25 30 40 years sometimes they were
[1:10:48] happy but all of a sudden one day
[1:10:50] they're not happy no more what is that
[1:10:53] that's the holy ghost coming down
[1:10:54] starting to brood over that Soul or your
[1:10:57] father he's calling him back to
[1:10:58] something the same thing brother Brown
[1:11:00] said about the man that was a car
[1:11:01] salesman he said oh he said when his
[1:11:03] wife got saved he said honey why don't
[1:11:05] you come to church and get the she said
[1:11:06] uh what is it uh get happy like I did he
[1:11:09] said get the religion or something like
[1:11:11] he the wife told her husband and he said
[1:11:13] oh no honey that ain't for me you going
[1:11:15] to church I don't mind you go to church
[1:11:16] I give you the checkbook you pay tiers
[1:11:18] you help the print Ministry out you do
[1:11:19] what you want to do but all that
[1:11:20] religions that ain't for me I'm happy
[1:11:22] doing what I'm doing she left him alone
[1:11:24] then one day he reached his pocket yeah
[1:11:27] he put out a track the track said where
[1:11:29] will you spend eternity all of a sudden
[1:11:31] something came over me what was it it
[1:11:33] was the Holy Ghost
[1:11:35] you see his wife words wasn't enough but
[1:11:37] when the Holy Ghost came down and
[1:11:39] anointed that man and said where he's
[1:11:41] been eternity all of a sudden he
[1:11:42] recognized something's different
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:45] I don't know I'm gonna turn it he said
[1:11:47] but I realized this I gotta settle that
[1:11:49] question now
[1:11:51] he's ready to listen
[1:11:56] See Redemption means you've got to be
[1:11:58] ready to come out of that condition
[1:12:01] in order to rightfully enter into the
[1:12:03] next condition you know back in the
[1:12:05] Redemption in the Old Testament when a
[1:12:07] man had six cities a refuge yes one on
[1:12:10] three on one side of the river and Well
[1:12:12] on one side the uh uh the the Jordan and
[1:12:15] one three on the other side of Jordan
[1:12:17] but before a man could enter that City
[1:12:20] you know he had to make an agreement
[1:12:22] he couldn't come in that City fussing no
[1:12:25] no you ain't got enough food here
[1:12:28] I don't like the way they cook
[1:12:30] and the way that people act around here
[1:12:31] you're just too religious for me in
[1:12:33] order to go in that City of Refuge you
[1:12:36] had to want to be there you had to feel
[1:12:39] that that smash Slayer that was looking
[1:12:41] for your life you had to feel he was bad
[1:12:43] enough I don't care what's in that City
[1:12:45] I'd rather be that City let out here
[1:12:47] with the manslayer
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:49] he had to be happy to be there he said
[1:12:52] boy it feels so peaceful in here that
[1:12:54] boy has to love it so much that why he
[1:12:56] didn't have to worry about him going
[1:12:57] back out because he was happy to be
[1:13:00] there but if a person not happy there
[1:13:02] you're better off leaving it when it
[1:13:04] happened until they're ready
[1:13:06] to make a change
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:09] let me keep going
[1:13:11] they had to recognize something else
[1:13:14] and when the gospel come to you and I
[1:13:16] what do we recognize there was a better
[1:13:18] way sister
[1:13:19] I don't care what I've been through in
[1:13:21] my life a nightclub that partied I was
[1:13:24] one of the boys with a little red and
[1:13:25] black jumpsuit so I'm spinning on my
[1:13:27] back that was brother Holloway
[1:13:29] but one day the worst the message came
[1:13:31] and God began to deal with my heart and
[1:13:33] I realized I wasn't happy spinning on my
[1:13:35] back I might have thought I was having
[1:13:37] fun with the boys but it wasn't
[1:13:38] satisfied but I found something that's
[1:13:41] satisfied because I got to inspired my
[1:13:44] life my bills started piling up and all
[1:13:46] of a sudden my business started failing
[1:13:47] and I said I'm just not happy no more
[1:13:49] and all of a sudden somebody came to me
[1:13:51] said would you like to come to church
[1:13:52] and I said yes I would and I came to
[1:13:54] church and a man had a call and I gave
[1:13:56] my life to Christ and you said brother
[1:13:58] my dad's a denomination it might have
[1:13:59] been but there was something real came
[1:14:01] in my heart because why I was ready for
[1:14:03] it
[1:14:04] even back then before the message came
[1:14:06] there was something in my heart said I
[1:14:08] need God and when I received Christ that
[1:14:10] lick I used to drink every night I came
[1:14:12] home all over the cabinets I took the
[1:14:14] top off at the pan and probably 30 a
[1:14:16] bottle and I pulled it right down and
[1:14:18] say wow something told me you don't need
[1:14:19] that no more
[1:14:24] I understand I'm saying I'm talking
[1:14:26] about Redemption there's got to be
[1:14:27] something you ready to come out of
[1:14:30] then God can say now here's something
[1:14:32] you can enter into
[1:14:35] and he ain't worried about you going
[1:14:37] back because you're gonna enjoy it when
[1:14:38] you get there
[1:14:39] now watch this
[1:14:41] you will call from what you once were
[1:14:44] to now you're here to recognize your
[1:14:47] true purpose
[1:14:49] you were never born to be a sinner
[1:14:53] you never born to struggle with bills
[1:14:55] you never stronger have body aches and
[1:14:58] pain makes that comes with age and I'm
[1:15:01] telling you you know yeah the internet
[1:15:04] experience that brother told one time
[1:15:05] keep breathing it comes with age
[1:15:07] but you weren't born for that right your
[1:15:10] purpose in being born in this Earth was
[1:15:13] to be a child of almighty God
[1:15:15] do you realize if Adam would have never
[1:15:17] seen in a garden every one of us would
[1:15:19] have been born from birth as Sons and
[1:15:20] Daughters from God Adam would have said
[1:15:22] let there be and he didn't look at that
[1:15:24] book and he saw your name he said it's
[1:15:26] time for the Holloway Let There Be and
[1:15:28] endure would have done this and God was
[1:15:29] a woof and then have been a breath of
[1:15:30] life in me not a war just like Adam
[1:15:34] explicit if it were to come God's
[1:15:37] intending way yeah but in the fall we've
[1:15:40] come another way so now God has revived
[1:15:43] away called Calvary to redeem us to
[1:15:45] bring us back to what you should have
[1:15:47] had
[1:15:48] now the only name that was in that book
[1:15:50] Brothers said was not your name like
[1:15:52] Michael or or Brother Juan or anything
[1:15:54] like that or brother Steve that's not in
[1:15:56] the book he said what's in a book is
[1:15:58] your purpose
[1:16:00] that you were to fulfill in Asian when
[1:16:02] she was to live
[1:16:03] John the Baptist is going to be a voice
[1:16:05] of one crying in a building is what
[1:16:07] preparing with the Lord it wasn't
[1:16:09] written that he was John the Baptist but
[1:16:10] it was written what that man would do
[1:16:12] when he came in his age
[1:16:14] it doesn't say William random but it
[1:16:17] said behold I should send you Malachi
[1:16:18] for but it's talking about a certain man
[1:16:21] in a certain age at a certain time
[1:16:24] and you and I will call for a purpose
[1:16:29] and you know you're gonna find it
[1:16:30] right here in the book
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:33] but because we were born in sin we
[1:16:35] bypassed it right but by preaching the
[1:16:38] gospel God brings it back and opens it
[1:16:40] up and shows you you miss something you
[1:16:43] miss something that's right you missed
[1:16:45] something and when I see it right there
[1:16:46] I said I sure did Lord forgive me I want
[1:16:49] that right there
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:00] it is right there in a book
[1:17:03] and when God saw you for the foundation
[1:17:05] world he didn't see me break dancing on
[1:17:07] my back he didn't see me in the club
[1:17:09] drinking liquor that ain't how he saw me
[1:17:11] when God saw him for about his word he
[1:17:13] saw me as the Son of God walking on this
[1:17:15] Earth
[1:17:16] that was his purpose
[1:17:19] now how do we get to this listen
[1:17:21] there's got to be something in you that
[1:17:23] hungers
[1:17:24] for a different life
[1:17:27] then once you begin to hunger God can
[1:17:29] show you what a different life is all
[1:17:31] about
[1:17:32] now I want you to watch this
[1:17:34] he can show you the real purpose to
[1:17:36] bring a person back to the purpose for
[1:17:39] which they were born watch how Paul puts
[1:17:41] us in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20.
[1:17:44] Paul said I am crucified with Christ
[1:17:47] in other words he was so tired
[1:17:50] of that life he did as a Pharisee
[1:17:52] he was ready to die to it
[1:17:54] in order that he might come out of that
[1:17:58] to enter to a new revelation
[1:18:01] not the Revelation that his father's
[1:18:03] taught him but the revelation of Jesus
[1:18:06] Christ now watch this
[1:18:09] I'm crucified with Christ never listen
[1:18:11] now watch this I Live Now watch this
[1:18:14] you're not I but Christ liveth in me and
[1:18:18] the life which I now live that's what he
[1:18:20] entered into
[1:18:21] I live in the flesh I live by the faith
[1:18:25] of the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:18:27] himself for me what was Paul doing he
[1:18:29] was describing two lives one time his
[1:18:31] life meant being a Pharisee and he was a
[1:18:34] good one
[1:18:35] Paul said when they come to the law I
[1:18:36] was blameless
[1:18:37] I didn't I didn't do this I didn't do
[1:18:39] that when it come to law I knew exactly
[1:18:41] how to be a good Pharisee but when the
[1:18:43] Revelation came
[1:18:45] he realized God had a different purpose
[1:18:48] for that Jew
[1:18:50] than being a good Pharisee
[1:18:53] now I want to take my time on this
[1:18:55] it's not a matter of how good we are at
[1:18:58] anything
[1:18:59] it's recognized a purpose
[1:19:02] for which you were created
[1:19:04] and there's only one man can show you
[1:19:06] what that is
[1:19:08] right it ain't the preacher
[1:19:10] it ain't even the prophet
[1:19:12] there's only one man
[1:19:14] that can show us what that is
[1:19:17] it's the same man that came to Paul and
[1:19:20] said Paul Paul wild thou kicking the
[1:19:22] Pricks it takes that man to come to you
[1:19:25] personally to show you who you are and
[1:19:28] what you're created for president said
[1:19:30] what is a new birth in Christ the
[1:19:31] mystery said what is it he said it's the
[1:19:33] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:19:35] personally
[1:19:38] our preacher can teach you our preacher
[1:19:41] can help you he can point you the right
[1:19:42] way but until that Christ comes to you
[1:19:45] personally
[1:19:49] now watch this
[1:19:51] and when he came to Paul personally Paul
[1:19:53] said a life I now live in the flesh
[1:19:55] it was the same flesh God never changed
[1:19:59] Paul's body he never said let me give
[1:20:01] you new sales in New Adams he never said
[1:20:03] let me put you in the ground and pull
[1:20:04] you back up again Paul said I live a
[1:20:06] different life what was so different if
[1:20:08] the Bible didn't change it was the
[1:20:09] Revelation that was in his heart
[1:20:12] something changed him from the love of
[1:20:13] the law something changed him to the
[1:20:15] love of Jesus Christ or you following me
[1:20:18] now watch this
[1:20:20] his Horrors will change
[1:20:22] and some Creed
[1:20:25] not some Creed a new doctrine
[1:20:27] but a personal experience by the
[1:20:29] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:20:30] that brought Paul to this new life
[1:20:33] not his old life patched up
[1:20:36] the passing out riding today
[1:20:39] going to lunch
[1:20:40] he had the youth meeting on
[1:20:43] and I don't know who was doing
[1:20:44] instructing
[1:20:46] but I like what he was saying
[1:20:49] this message
[1:20:51] it's not about how hard you can try to
[1:20:53] live
[1:20:54] with that Prophet taught
[1:20:56] and the used example of About a Boy
[1:20:57] brother Bram said that was about to
[1:20:59] marry a girl
[1:21:00] and that boy was doing everything right
[1:21:02] as far as the Christian duties that
[1:21:03] people would say it's oh he's a fine
[1:21:05] young man he's a Christian brother I'm
[1:21:07] saying but it's still in him there's
[1:21:08] something that's not quite right
[1:21:11] I will leave everything's there
[1:21:13] but annually where the real change has
[1:21:17] to come
[1:21:18] whoever that was teaching I appreciated
[1:21:20] the way you brought about something in
[1:21:22] that boy had not changed
[1:21:24] something inside of him still loved he
[1:21:27] had a connection to that old life
[1:21:30] but it's not a matter of whether your
[1:21:31] flesh gets tired of working but when the
[1:21:33] soul Jesus Christ said he that heavy
[1:21:35] Lane and his soul will get rest not the
[1:21:38] flesh
[1:21:40] the soul has to be the one that's tired
[1:21:43] of the way things are
[1:21:45] then the Soul could find his change
[1:21:48] but religion could teach this man hear
[1:21:50] how to walk better our brother I'll talk
[1:21:53] number one today he said he used to hang
[1:21:55] out around the Seminary to see who we
[1:21:57] could find a witness to he said his sort
[1:21:59] of boards of assembly they're practicing
[1:22:00] the sermon
[1:22:01] no honestly I hit you up yeah I like
[1:22:04] that
[1:22:06] you see he's working on the flesh but if
[1:22:09] the Holy Ghost
[1:22:13] you're getting the pulpit yell that gift
[1:22:15] and watch God use it
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:20] and it works outside the pool because it
[1:22:21] doesn't work in the Pulpit are you
[1:22:23] follow me but it's something that
[1:22:26] changes the man
[1:22:27] from the inside and I think that's what
[1:22:30] the brother was emphasizing the boy had
[1:22:32] lived a good life but there had not been
[1:22:34] a change on the inside let me keep going
[1:22:38] there's got to be literally a new life
[1:22:40] comes in and that new life makes you a
[1:22:42] new creation the old man has passed away
[1:22:44] and behold All Things become new and
[1:22:46] that new man isn't just a new doctrine
[1:22:49] it's a person
[1:22:52] Jesus Christ the word come into you
[1:22:56] now let's watch how Paul got there with
[1:22:58] himself
[1:22:59] Paul was a starch Pharisee as I said
[1:23:03] as a Pharisee
[1:23:05] Paul carried the word
[1:23:10] the prophet Isaiah said
[1:23:12] tell us Paul
[1:23:15] break it down
[1:23:17] oh righteous shall conceive
[1:23:19] and here she go walking right by him
[1:23:22] no clue what's happening
[1:23:24] the voice of one Crown in the wilderness
[1:23:26] there he is on the corner call him an
[1:23:28] old crank
[1:23:30] the spirit of laws that fall upon All
[1:23:32] Flesh and here they are listen now
[1:23:34] preaching the gospel in flesh and Paul
[1:23:37] looking at the same people
[1:23:39] with that Bob in his hands
[1:23:41] and locking them up
[1:23:44] you see what I'm getting at
[1:23:46] that was Paul's first life
[1:23:50] Paul said listen
[1:23:52] but listen
[1:23:53] for I was least amongst the apostles
[1:23:56] and not meet or worry that it be called
[1:23:58] an apostle because I persecuted the
[1:24:01] church
[1:24:02] of God
[1:24:04] see he didn't understand the mystery of
[1:24:06] redemption
[1:24:07] Not only was God going to have a church
[1:24:10] but he was going to do some Paul really
[1:24:12] couldn't understand
[1:24:13] she was gonna be a gentile
[1:24:17] Not only was he going to have a church
[1:24:19] that he could live in but Paul it isn't
[1:24:22] going to be your people
[1:24:24] I put them to the side she's gonna be a
[1:24:28] gentile
[1:24:30] so here's the man that thought he knew
[1:24:32] the word but yet he was persecuting the
[1:24:34] word
[1:24:35] because he had not met the person of
[1:24:38] Revelation
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:40] or you follow me
[1:24:42] now watch this watch how this work for
[1:24:44] Paul Galatians chapter 1 verse 13.
[1:24:47] Paul said if I've heard if you've heard
[1:24:49] of my conversation in time past in the
[1:24:52] Jews religion Paul said that's a
[1:24:53] religion once he met this all that law
[1:24:57] that was a religion he knew the real
[1:24:59] thing now
[1:25:01] if you heard my conversation time
[1:25:02] passing a Jewish religion how'd that
[1:25:04] beyond measure I persecuted who the
[1:25:07] Church of God
[1:25:08] and wasted it
[1:25:10] here's the Paul the man that thought it
[1:25:12] was such a big man as a Pharisee
[1:25:14] saying I was wasting my time because the
[1:25:17] thing that God was actually doing the
[1:25:19] real move of God instead of me propping
[1:25:22] it up
[1:25:23] I was trying to tear it down let me keep
[1:25:28] going
[1:25:29] you see Paul's Choice it was the speak
[1:25:32] against the church and to persecute it
[1:25:35] that was his choice now watch my title
[1:25:37] again call for what
[1:25:39] a purpose God never called Paul to tear
[1:25:43] down nobody's Church
[1:25:46] he did call Paul to take down the law
[1:25:49] but not to take down nobody's Church
[1:25:51] Paul was actually ordained to help
[1:25:53] establish a church
[1:25:55] and not one but one in galatia one in
[1:25:58] ever since one Colossians follow me Paul
[1:26:02] was an apostle he went all around the
[1:26:04] region to work propping up churches
[1:26:06] everywhere he went
[1:26:09] so the thing that he once torn down was
[1:26:12] actually contrary to what he was called
[1:26:15] to do but in Revelation had to show him
[1:26:17] you're going wrong come out of that
[1:26:19] condition Paul come into your real
[1:26:22] predestinated Calling
[1:26:26] in Redemption it called him out of what
[1:26:29] he was to reveal to him his real purpose
[1:26:32] in life
[1:26:34] this message is revealed to me my real
[1:26:36] purpose
[1:26:37] brother Brown said I'm not a son of
[1:26:39] Charles Miller Branham my real purpose
[1:26:41] in life was to be
[1:26:43] Son of God
[1:26:45] I used to want to be a big businessman
[1:26:48] when I used to be on my back spinning
[1:26:50] around in my little black and red
[1:26:51] jumpsuit thinking I was cool
[1:26:54] when I was in college getting my
[1:26:56] education you know why because I was
[1:26:57] gonna make money
[1:26:58] and to make money you gotta go to school
[1:27:00] so I'm going to school to learn
[1:27:02] I'm gonna show these folks something
[1:27:04] they don't take a little black boy out
[1:27:05] of the Bronx
[1:27:07] can learn how to make money
[1:27:08] all they think we can do is spin around
[1:27:10] our back and go poop
[1:27:12] I'm gonna show him I'm gonna get
[1:27:14] magication
[1:27:16] I'm gonna go down and start my business
[1:27:18] I'll make me a bunch of money I'm gonna
[1:27:20] drive right up into the business
[1:27:21] district say who's that Thug he
[1:27:24] said that's the man that owns that
[1:27:24] building right there
[1:27:26] cause I'm gonna show them what a little
[1:27:28] boy out of Bronx New York can do
[1:27:31] and while I'm in a process they're
[1:27:33] getting my education
[1:27:35] yeah I had a car accident
[1:27:38] the doctor said I wasn't supposed to
[1:27:39] make it matter of fact they called my
[1:27:41] mother said you got a bow before they
[1:27:42] die if you want to say goodbye to your
[1:27:43] son
[1:27:45] I was there give me up I was in
[1:27:47] intensive care on respirators machine
[1:27:49] keep them alive they said come say
[1:27:51] goodbye to him
[1:27:53] I wasn't saved
[1:27:56] I was lost
[1:27:58] but I wasn't predestinated
[1:28:01] for that purpose
[1:28:03] so God had to change circumstances
[1:28:07] because if you're ordained to be a
[1:28:09] certain thing listen there's not the
[1:28:11] death nor Hell no power no principality
[1:28:13] nothing in this life or the world could
[1:28:15] come to separate me from the love of God
[1:28:17] in Christ Jesus
[1:28:19] I don't care how much I spent on my back
[1:28:20] no matter how much I was dealing drugs
[1:28:22] no matter how much I was drinking liquor
[1:28:24] God said That's my boy
[1:28:28] and I've already paid for him
[1:28:31] so this you cannot have him
[1:28:36] and the boy that was dying the doctors
[1:28:39] gave up all of a sudden the body started
[1:28:41] stretching it again
[1:28:44] and it regained conscious again it could
[1:28:47] talk it could walk they said we wouldn't
[1:28:48] be the walk again I can walk and I could
[1:28:50] jump
[1:28:56] and I ain't gonna try to jump too high
[1:28:58] my 57 I might hear some
[1:29:01] but I can jump
[1:29:04] what brought me back Redemption
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:08] Israel didn't deserve that land but how
[1:29:11] did they get it Redemption by God's
[1:29:14] elective love
[1:29:16] he made a promise to Abraham and he was
[1:29:18] going to keep that promise
[1:29:20] or you follow me
[1:29:22] so God has a purpose for every elect
[1:29:24] person you didn't come to this message
[1:29:26] because your mama was in this message or
[1:29:28] your dad was in his message or Brother
[1:29:29] Juan was such a good teacher he knew how
[1:29:31] to break that thing down and though he's
[1:29:32] a good teacher you break it down
[1:29:34] that wasn't alone wasn't it there had to
[1:29:37] be something deeper working in you
[1:29:41] and what you got to learn to do is to
[1:29:44] like Abraham Lord how should I know I'm
[1:29:46] gonna get it let me show you Abraham
[1:29:48] there's a sacrifice and if you can have
[1:29:51] confidence in this confidence nothing is
[1:29:53] going to keep you out of that land
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:56] have your confidence and your sacrifice
[1:30:01] and My Sacrifice revealing me as a
[1:30:04] bleeding blood and word of this age I'm
[1:30:06] not on the Lutheran sacrifice that was a
[1:30:08] good sacrifice and I don't know where's
[1:30:09] the sacrifice that was good sacrifice
[1:30:11] I'm not even under Pentecostal
[1:30:14] sacrifice
[1:30:15] I'm under Malachi 4.
[1:30:18] sacrifice
[1:30:20] the fullness of the lamb be slain
[1:30:26] I can eat lutherans that'd give me a
[1:30:28] little strength in my legs
[1:30:30] strength around my loins I get the
[1:30:33] Pentecost to give me a little stretch of
[1:30:34] my lips I speak in tongues
[1:30:36] but I wanted to poor lamb I want the
[1:30:38] whole body the hell listen to have the
[1:30:41] fullness of redemption
[1:30:45] what is that fullness of redemption go
[1:30:48] to the Book of Genesis look at what the
[1:30:50] first man was
[1:30:51] the first Adam when Christ came as the
[1:30:53] last Adam he came to demonstrate what
[1:30:55] the first Adam looked like
[1:30:58] when he cursed that tree he shows what
[1:31:00] Adam could do are you following me when
[1:31:02] you talk to the storms to the winds he
[1:31:03] shows what Adam could do
[1:31:06] and he came to redeem me back to that
[1:31:09] not to a church order
[1:31:11] we've gotten good at church order
[1:31:13] and I'm thankful for it because without
[1:31:15] order without Doctrine for the best of
[1:31:17] church got no backbone
[1:31:18] but he didn't call me back to church
[1:31:20] harder
[1:31:23] I'm feeling pretty good not Rohan
[1:31:27] he didn't say brother Holloway when the
[1:31:29] Jews came out of the promised land and
[1:31:31] the Wilderness Brother Juan they got
[1:31:33] church order
[1:31:35] but they would call the church order
[1:31:37] they will cause the fullness of
[1:31:39] Redemption where Abraham walk you walk
[1:31:41] the same streets where Abraham
[1:31:43] Fellowship you Fellowship the same
[1:31:45] streets where Abraham prays to God you
[1:31:46] build an altar right there and praise
[1:31:48] your God
[1:31:50] Abraham then Worship in the wilderness
[1:31:52] he was in the land
[1:31:56] I don't want to stop in the wilderness
[1:31:58] order was established in the wilderness
[1:32:01] but it was necessary yes
[1:32:05] I want the order
[1:32:07] but my heart's hungering for the promise
[1:32:11] how many said I'm going to spend when
[1:32:12] I'm getting that yeah
[1:32:13] God called me out for a purpose
[1:32:16] what did that reward in this age tell me
[1:32:19] that purpose would be
[1:32:21] he told Brother Branham and Rising the
[1:32:22] son
[1:32:24] he said that in the first age there was
[1:32:27] a wave Chief weighed
[1:32:29] said there was one
[1:32:31] his name was Jesus Christ
[1:32:33] the word
[1:32:34] but God waved him saying what to the
[1:32:36] world he was just a first
[1:32:39] but on the day of Pentecost there's
[1:32:40] coming more
[1:32:42] just like him yeah
[1:32:44] there was so much like him the Bible
[1:32:45] said they called him Christians because
[1:32:47] they were so christ-like
[1:32:51] when they saw those men they saw Jesus
[1:32:53] Christ
[1:32:55] and Paul said how did I do it he said
[1:32:57] it's not I
[1:32:58] that liveth
[1:33:00] is Christ literally living in me
[1:33:05] you see I find that some people can come
[1:33:07] to church and they get satisfied there
[1:33:09] that's the two and a half tribes that
[1:33:10] stay in the wilderness
[1:33:12] but there's some
[1:33:13] that kid in church by the one they're
[1:33:16] good people
[1:33:17] but they just can't seem to satisfy that
[1:33:19] hunger don't feel bad about yourself
[1:33:20] that's a good thing
[1:33:22] listen to him now that's a good thing
[1:33:24] why because you're hungering for
[1:33:26] something greater
[1:33:29] that's something greater is that Christ
[1:33:31] that can live in you in such a way that
[1:33:34] you can say just like Paul it's no
[1:33:36] longer I that liveth
[1:33:39] but see I like to use that type of like
[1:33:41] the color man I'm like that color man I
[1:33:44] thank God for the mess you give me I'm
[1:33:46] and I eat it I enjoy it but I wipe my
[1:33:49] mouth I said but there's more of it
[1:33:53] I'm not going to be satisfied to that
[1:33:55] little something inside of me said that
[1:33:57] greater portion
[1:33:59] that's mine that's what this age has
[1:34:02] that learn the others did we were
[1:34:04] promised a double potion
[1:34:08] are you following me and in order for
[1:34:10] there to be thank you my brother you
[1:34:12] know I got one in my pocket I'm just too
[1:34:14] lazy to pull it out
[1:34:18] you people make a preacher feel good
[1:34:21] you're easy to talk to
[1:34:22] you I mean that sincerely
[1:34:24] it ain't in every Church
[1:34:26] don't you let that lift you up I don't
[1:34:28] mean it that way
[1:34:29] but sometimes there's an atmosphere as a
[1:34:31] preacher but the one knows I'm talking
[1:34:32] about
[1:34:33] you feel the Liberty
[1:34:34] you can say what's on your heart
[1:34:36] and you feel like the people receiving
[1:34:38] it
[1:34:39] I believe you received what I'm saying
[1:34:40] tonight
[1:34:41] Redemption isn't just coming out
[1:34:44] you have to have a revelation
[1:34:47] of what you're going into
[1:34:49] now let me read Paul and I'm gonna stop
[1:34:51] I'm gonna finish in the morning
[1:34:53] let me read Paul's the rest of Paul's
[1:34:56] message
[1:34:57] Paul said I persecute the Church of God
[1:34:59] and wasted it
[1:35:00] and profiting the Jews religions
[1:35:02] above many of my equals in my own Nation
[1:35:04] being more exceeding zealous of the
[1:35:07] tradition of the fathers see he got
[1:35:09] caught up in the framework
[1:35:11] but the Revelation was Jesus Christ the
[1:35:13] word to him personally yes you follow me
[1:35:15] now watch that watch what changed it
[1:35:18] wasn't gamelia's teaching it wasn't some
[1:35:20] new doctrine but Paul had to receive a
[1:35:22] personal revelation Jesus Christ
[1:35:24] appeared to him personally
[1:35:26] Paul says First Corinthians 15 verse 9
[1:35:28] again for I'm the least of the Apostles
[1:35:30] and not meant to be called an apostle
[1:35:32] because our persecuted Church of God
[1:35:34] but by the grace of God I am
[1:35:37] what I am
[1:35:40] you see he never worked himself up to
[1:35:42] become an apostle
[1:35:44] Paul's Choice listen was to be a chief
[1:35:48] amongst the Pharisees
[1:35:50] and he had achieved it brother one he
[1:35:52] was so cheap among the Pharisees they
[1:35:54] said who can we get to stop this church
[1:35:56] everybody said Paul
[1:35:59] Austin I was waiting for y'all to say
[1:36:01] that
[1:36:02] says the little boy I wanted to be chief
[1:36:04] of Muslim Pharisee and I'm there
[1:36:07] they got such confidence they think I'm
[1:36:09] the man that can stop
[1:36:11] this Holy Ghost
[1:36:13] no no way to stop a holy ghost Revival
[1:36:15] the Holy Ghost hit him
[1:36:18] and Paul found out hey it is so bad at
[1:36:21] all
[1:36:23] and he become
[1:36:26] they said now he who once persecuted us
[1:36:28] has now come one of us
[1:36:31] I can't tell you how many men I'd have
[1:36:33] met that told me they first heard this
[1:36:35] message they got their Bible said I'm
[1:36:36] gonna prove it wrong they started
[1:36:38] reading they started reading and said
[1:36:39] wait a minute
[1:36:40] these people got some
[1:36:43] are you following me that's what's
[1:36:45] Paul's testimony now watch this Paul's
[1:36:48] desire
[1:36:49] was to be a chief of the Pharisee
[1:36:52] but God's desire was to make him an
[1:36:54] apostle Paul said I'm not impossible
[1:36:56] because I ever wanted to be one
[1:36:59] I am what I am by the grace of God
[1:37:03] now watch this watch this
[1:37:06] Ephesians chapter one
[1:37:07] let's look at how Paul becomes an
[1:37:09] apostle this is what I'm going to let
[1:37:10] you go I want to show you now if you
[1:37:13] believe this message
[1:37:15] if God's dealing with your heart
[1:37:17] that's not your decision
[1:37:19] brother Brown was said in so many
[1:37:20] messages he said it's something you
[1:37:22] desired that wasn't even in there
[1:37:24] because you could not desire it he said
[1:37:27] it's in the center to be like Adam when
[1:37:28] God calls they run
[1:37:30] he said God had to give you the desire
[1:37:35] do you understand
[1:37:37] now watch this
[1:37:39] Paul an apostle
[1:37:41] of Jesus Christ how
[1:37:43] about a will of God
[1:37:45] I am what I am by the grace of God it
[1:37:50] was not my will
[1:37:53] it was his will
[1:37:55] now watch this Acts chapter 9 verse 13.
[1:37:58] an ananias answered now Jesus Christ
[1:38:01] coming to ananias
[1:38:03] he said ananias you're servant I got a
[1:38:06] job for you to do
[1:38:07] I need to go witness to somebody and I
[1:38:10] say who is it Lord
[1:38:13] he says Saul of Tarsus
[1:38:19] he really got to fasten it is I'd had a
[1:38:21] bad dream
[1:38:22] for a minute I had a dream I was talking
[1:38:24] to the Holy Ghost
[1:38:26] it made it come back to him again said
[1:38:28] I'm nice
[1:38:29] he said oh man
[1:38:32] what is it Lord I caught somebody to
[1:38:34] baptize
[1:38:36] who is the Lord
[1:38:38] solar tarse
[1:38:40] now watch out ananias I've heard about
[1:38:42] many about this man
[1:38:44] how much evil he has done to thy Saints
[1:38:46] in the Jerusalem and that he has
[1:38:48] Authority from the chief priests to bind
[1:38:50] all that call on thy name but the Lord
[1:38:52] said unto him go that way for he is a
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:38:59] there's a purpose for Paul it ain't to
[1:39:02] prosecute you it's to join you
[1:39:06] you understand

[1:39:15] and bring you back to you're literally a
[1:39:17] walking talking son and daughter of God
[1:39:21] and in this age manifesting listen
[1:39:23] because the promises ages what the
[1:39:26] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:39:28] literally manifested what Adam had in
[1:39:30] the garden you're not going to have it
[1:39:32] so much soul to listen we're going to
[1:39:33] have a body
[1:39:35] without sin
[1:39:37] we even in this hour Redemption comes to
[1:39:39] the Redemption of our bodies
[1:39:43] in a moment in the twinkling of eye I'm
[1:39:46] not going to have a redeemed Soul
[1:39:47] Brother one I'm gonna have a body
[1:39:49] without sin and that little 19 year old
[1:39:52] boy that's the spirit is back I'm going
[1:39:53] back to that 19 year old boy
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:56] come on now not spitting on my back
[1:40:00] but said to the wind peace be still
[1:40:03] because this is what God meant for me to
[1:40:06] be but for the foundation of the world
[1:40:08] and sadly couldn't stop it because I'm
[1:40:11] called for that purpose
[1:40:15] don't let Satan beat you down oh yes
[1:40:18] while we're in this body isn't that what
[1:40:19] the body is saying Paul said woe unto me
[1:40:22] for this body of sin and his flesh I
[1:40:24] deserve the devil let's serve the world
[1:40:25] but in my spirit I serve God
[1:40:30] you're going to fight it every day of
[1:40:32] your life
[1:40:33] but just make sure you stay prayed up
[1:40:35] and you can whip him
[1:40:37] he'll raise up and Paul said I beat him
[1:40:39] dated black and blue
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:42] I ain't going to church shut up
[1:40:46] where you want to go eat after we get
[1:40:47] out of church
[1:40:49] I feed you but we're going to church

[1:41:06] dear heavenly father
[1:41:08] I want to thank you for your grace
[1:41:09] tonight
[1:41:11] there is a mystery called Redemption
[1:41:15] it's for a people Lord
[1:41:17] that were foreordained to a certain
[1:41:18] place
[1:41:20] but sin made a great blockade
[1:41:23] but it couldn't stop your purpose
[1:41:26] so you prepared a lamb
[1:41:29] Abraham had to provide his own Lambs
[1:41:32] but for this Redemption
[1:41:35] it wouldn't be a lamb that was a man
[1:41:36] offering
[1:41:38] he'd be a lamb of God that you offered
[1:41:41] every head by every head bowed
[1:41:46] Lord I
[1:41:48] stopped right now for a moment
[1:41:51] I'm not exactly sure what you desire to
[1:41:53] do
[1:41:55] but I do believe you're present

[1:42:14] forgive me in my sins
[1:42:16] anything that I would have thought done
[1:42:18] that would have hindered your move
[1:42:19] tonight
[1:42:21] but God may you finish what you started
[1:42:22] tonight
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:25] if there's any here tonight to desire
[1:42:28] more of that Redemptive power
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:31] desire that Jesus Christ would do
[1:42:33] something for you
[1:42:35] to take something from you
[1:42:37] that you're tired of you're ready to let
[1:42:38] go you're ready to come out of one
[1:42:40] condition and you're ready now to enter
[1:42:42] into another condition a preface that
[1:42:44] God calls you for before the foundation
[1:42:46] of the world
[1:42:48] just raise your hand say Lord I'm

[1:42:56] I'm battling with Lord take me from this
[1:42:58] condition and Lord put me into that
[1:42:59] place that you ordained for me to be or
[1:43:01] for the foundation of the world God you
[1:43:03] see the hands you see the hearts Lord
[1:43:06] mine up too Lord there's things that I'm
[1:43:08] Desiring to Greater move to Greater
[1:43:10] Revival for greater power for greater
[1:43:12] surrender Lord I pray that you bless
[1:43:14] every hand that's went up tonight every
[1:43:16] heart that's hungry tonight God made the
[1:43:18] Holy Ghost move in such a way Lord that
[1:43:20] you literally tear it from them Lord
[1:43:22] that they'll be free that they'll know
[1:43:24] tonight that something has changed not
[1:43:26] the power of just a decision but the
[1:43:28] power of God behind that decision God we
[1:43:31] thank you tonight as we commit all into
[1:43:34] your hands
[1:43:35] blessed name of Jesus Christ we ask
[1:43:38] May the Church Say Amen
[1:43:40] amen
[1:43:42] amen amen
[1:43:45] amen
[1:44:04] foreign
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:48] our such versus
[1:44:56] when he was on the cross
[1:45:05] my
[1:45:13] yes he knew
[1:45:16] me
[1:45:20] and he
[1:45:23] loved me
[1:45:29] he will glory
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:41] so one word
[1:45:48] our best Mercy
[1:45:56] when he was on the cross
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:16] you understand why I brought up random
[1:46:18] shadies
[1:46:19] only those that serve God's purpose
[1:46:22] thank you
[1:46:24] Resurrection is promised to the purpose
[1:46:27] of God
[1:46:32] because when God is calling
[1:46:34] the Saints out of the Earth
[1:46:37] he's not calling
[1:46:39] one area Joseph
[1:46:43] Simon God is calling his purpose
[1:46:49] brother Branham says Resurrection is
[1:46:52] sure for the purpose of God
[1:46:56] and that's what all Redemption is about
[1:46:58] is it's about a purpose
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:04] and that's what the devil is trying to
[1:47:06] keep us from
[1:47:11] is occupying our mind all you have not
[1:47:13] achieved this or you are your you are
[1:47:15] you have not he's just trying to
[1:47:17] distract us
[1:47:21] but the word is drawing us to God's
[1:47:24] purpose
[1:47:29] and and when you can recognize that just
[1:47:32] just look at this Simon
[1:47:35] when they brought Jesus
[1:47:38] because the Lord has told him you will
[1:47:41] not die until you see the salvation of
[1:47:45] Israel
[1:47:47] and the day that Joseph and Mary entered
[1:47:50] the temple
[1:47:51] he said Lord let your servant depart in
[1:47:54] peace
[1:47:56] because my eyes have seen the salvation
[1:47:59] of Israel this is your purpose
[1:48:04] whatever can happen let it happen
[1:48:07] I have hit the climax
[1:48:15] or church
[1:48:19] when we identify their purpose
[1:48:24] your life will never be the same
[1:48:28] you will become one of the most happiest
[1:48:31] person
[1:48:39] the problem of Life the struggle of life
[1:48:42] you will still have them but they will
[1:48:45] not matter to you
[1:48:46] foreign
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:43] they ask you
[1:49:46] just who I am
[1:49:51] oh tell them
[1:49:55] I am ready
[1:50:01] oh yes
[1:50:04] I am breathing
[1:50:09] I'm hard with the price
[1:50:16] Jesus
[1:50:18] has changed my
[1:50:21] whole life
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:34] oh just
[1:50:37] who I am
[1:50:41] telling
[1:50:43] that I am breathing oh let's sing it to
[1:50:48] the Lord mouth you believe that tonight
[1:50:51] yes I am
[1:50:54] repeat
[1:50:57] oh I'm bored with
[1:51:01] a price
[1:51:06] Jesus
[1:51:07] has changed
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:19] anybody asks you
[1:51:22] oh and just so
[1:51:26] I am
[1:51:29] tell them
[1:51:32] that I am
[1:51:39] your brother Max says something tonight
[1:51:44] you know that's that's the thing with
[1:51:45] preachers I mean teachers they are very
[1:51:48] organized they still write in time I
[1:51:51] just feel like running tonight praise
[1:51:52] the Lord there's more time to preach
[1:51:54] tonight
[1:51:57] I just feel ironic tonight
[1:51:59] with the thought of our brother but he
[1:52:02] says something tonight
[1:52:05] brother Branham said in souls in prison
[1:52:09] the prophet of God said
[1:52:12] all the ages now you see when God sent a
[1:52:16] messenger
[1:52:17] the message of the messenger becomes the
[1:52:20] blood of the Covenant for the people
[1:52:23] now when the age passes
[1:52:27] that sacrifice becomes the sacrifice of
[1:52:31] bulls and goats
[1:52:34] praise the Lord because the blood of
[1:52:37] bulls and ghosts was just a substitute
[1:52:41] so now that you have the message of the
[1:52:44] hour
[1:52:45] looter message Wesley message is just a
[1:52:49] substitute
[1:52:51] praise the Lord
[1:52:52] it was good for that age
[1:52:57] but you need the sacrifice for your age
[1:53:03] praise the Lord
[1:53:05] that's the reason why you you cannot go
[1:53:09] along with your old church ideas
[1:53:13] praise the Lord
[1:53:14] it was good for that age
[1:53:17] the Pentecostal message was good for
[1:53:19] their age
[1:53:21] it restore the gifts
[1:53:24] praise the Lord
[1:53:27] but you need the sacrifice for your age
[1:53:30] for your bae
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:39] I mean there is a lot of things running
[1:53:41] to my mind now and I can preach at one
[1:53:43] hour service if you just allow me praise
[1:53:46] the Lord amen
[1:53:52] this is the sacrifice for your Bay
[1:53:58] blood that is speaking better things on
[1:54:01] your behalf those things on the tapes
[1:54:04] that's the reason why brother Branham
[1:54:06] said it would give you Rapture in faith
[1:54:08] because it's speaking on your behalf
[1:54:11] it's not speaking against you
[1:54:13] those things on the tips are not
[1:54:15] speaking against you the things that
[1:54:18] brother random said in marriage and
[1:54:19] divorce is not speaking against you is
[1:54:21] speaking on your behalf
[1:54:27] praise the Lord
[1:54:31] when the message says uh uh you know
[1:54:33] this is the way you should go about
[1:54:35] certain things it's not speaking against
[1:54:37] you it's actually speaking on your
[1:54:40] behalf just like the blood of everybody
[1:54:43] cry out of the earth that's the same
[1:54:45] with the voice of God on those tapes are
[1:54:48] speaking on your behalf
[1:54:53] thank you
[1:54:56] if you're playing a tip and brother
[1:54:57] Branham says something
[1:54:59] and it hits you
[1:55:02] it is just God's mercy to you it's not
[1:55:05] there to condemn you
[1:55:09] the reason why the devil will like to
[1:55:12] make you to feel like is condemning you
[1:55:14] because he don't want you to have access
[1:55:16] to the mercy of God
[1:55:19] this is the sacrifice if we walk in the
[1:55:23] light as he is in the light the blood
[1:55:26] speaks on our behalf
[1:55:35] praise the Lord
[1:55:42] now you see the way the human mind runs
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:47] if we had a
[1:55:49] a a a distribution
[1:55:52] of the blood the literal blood of Jesus
[1:55:55] Christ
[1:55:58] I'm telling you everywhere you go you're
[1:56:00] going to keep that in your purse
[1:56:04] praise the Lord before you you get in a
[1:56:08] car in the morning you will take the
[1:56:10] blood on your finger you put it on your
[1:56:12] wheel
[1:56:14] because you have electoral blood it will
[1:56:16] become so precious to you
[1:56:19] but that's how the world's supposed to
[1:56:21] be that's how the message of the hour is
[1:56:24] supposed to be
[1:56:28] that's the sacrifice for this hour
[1:56:32] that's the thing that is going to change
[1:56:35] our life
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:41] I mean I was sitting there there were
[1:56:43] just a lot of things going through my
[1:56:44] mind
[1:56:46] but I think the preacher has left us on
[1:56:49] a good atmosphere let me not ruin it
[1:56:51] praise the Lord amen let me not ruin it
[1:56:54] tonight
[1:56:55] let's just stay under Thy word the
[1:56:58] mystery of redemption
[1:57:00] praise the Lord
[1:57:02] the provision that God has made
[1:57:05] to bring us back
[1:57:09] to our
[1:57:11] inheritance
[1:57:13] to bring us back to Power
[1:57:22] you love the Lord tonight
[1:57:24] you appreciate the word
[1:57:26] let's give the Lord a hint of praise
[1:57:29] thank you Jesus
[1:57:33] thank you Lord
[1:57:35] thank you for speaking on our behalf
[1:57:37] tonight
[1:57:39] praise the Lord
[1:57:43] to think about it
[1:57:45] think about it
[1:57:47] amen
[1:57:49] pray for brother Michael tomorrow
[1:57:51] that the Lord will use him the Lord will
[1:57:54] give you in the Labor Day
[1:57:55] that he will be able to just bring the
[1:57:57] word
[1:57:58] but you see
[1:58:01] and I'm going to say this because he he
[1:58:03] kind of shared that with us
[1:58:06] to see that uh you know he talked about
[1:58:09] a testimony of God raising him up after
[1:58:11] an accident
[1:58:13] praise the Lord
[1:58:15] and how the Lord has has healed him
[1:58:17] miraculously
[1:58:19] from addiction is back and everything
[1:58:24] and he's holding uh the the word the
[1:58:27] talking
[1:58:29] because the doctor told him that he's
[1:58:31] having a bad heart
[1:58:34] praise the Lord now you think about that
[1:58:36] tonight
[1:58:39] think about that if a man never met his
[1:58:42] purpose
[1:58:45] and the doctor he having a doctor order
[1:58:52] is just a place where he will stay in
[1:58:54] his bed
[1:58:56] and start mourning his death and start
[1:58:58] looking for sympathy
[1:59:00] praise the Lord
[1:59:03] think about it what the purpose of God
[1:59:06] would do to your life
[1:59:09] recognizing the purpose of God will take
[1:59:11] away your excuses
[1:59:14] because some of the excuses we have they
[1:59:16] are silly
[1:59:19] they are silly they are not helping you
[1:59:21] to advance in your work with God
[1:59:24] you are making poor excuses for no
[1:59:27] reason
[1:59:29] no reason
[1:59:35] a man honor a doctor diagnosis with
[1:59:38] heart problem is preaching to you
[1:59:40] tonight
[1:59:41] he's deferring down order because he has
[1:59:44] the word that is talking
[1:59:47] foreign
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:59] we start looking for some kind of for
[2:00:02] sympathy
[2:00:04] look for excuses to stay away from
[2:00:06] church
[2:00:09] therapy for people sympathy nobody Call
[2:00:12] Me Nobody sent me high
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:18] if you meet God's purpose
[2:00:22] if God's purpose of redemption is
[2:00:24] revealed to you
[2:00:28] it will kick you from from off of your
[2:00:32] high horses
[2:00:34] that's what it did to Paul on the road
[2:00:35] of Damascus
[2:00:38] [Music]
[2:00:44] that's when a man found the purpose of
[2:00:46] God
[2:00:54] and when you recognize that
[2:00:58] it drives your life it gives you energy
[2:01:01] everything
[2:01:03] it gives you energy
[2:01:05] even when your body is tired it gives
[2:01:07] you energy
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:11] praise the Lord
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:19] you know sometimes that's the reason why
[2:01:20] you know people would think that you
[2:01:23] know uh uh the the preachers are in
[2:01:25] water
[2:01:26] because we never hear them complain we
[2:01:28] never see them you know uh no it's
[2:01:31] because there is something that is
[2:01:33] driving them
[2:01:36] there is something that is driving them
[2:01:39] and that's all you see
[2:01:45] [Music]
[2:01:54] praise the Lord
[2:01:57] I really enjoy the word tonight
[2:02:01] amen I really enjoy the word tonight the
[2:02:04] world being preached in simplicity
[2:02:08] that draws everyone in
[2:02:11] it draws you in it makes you involve you
[2:02:14] get involved you just don't sit down and
[2:02:17] enjoy it but you get involved
[2:02:20] you get involved
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:26] what are we doing here
[2:02:29] how did we get here
[2:02:34] how did we get to this place
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:39] what's going on around this little group
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:51] praise the Lord
[2:02:54] amen
[2:02:56] well if God purpose is for you to be a
[2:02:58] billionaire keep going after it
[2:03:01] amen if God's purpose is for you to
[2:03:05] become you know all of those things are
[2:03:07] supplementary they are just blessings
[2:03:09] that God throw they are just like Boaz
[2:03:12] throwing a piece of soft loss on roof
[2:03:18] all of those blessings of God the things
[2:03:20] that we occupied our mind with
[2:03:24] because Ruth was in the line of purpose
[2:03:29] to redeem now mean everything that she
[2:03:31] had lost she said your God will be my
[2:03:34] God your people will be my people
[2:03:37] that thing was driving Ruth that she did
[2:03:40] not care what he said about her
[2:03:42] everybody said that someone might get
[2:03:44] she did not care
[2:03:46] because she have she has caught her
[2:03:48] purpose this woman has lost her husband
[2:03:51] she had lost her two sons I'm going to
[2:03:54] stick with her till death
[2:03:57] not even realizing
[2:03:59] that she was going to be the wife of a
[2:04:02] prince
[2:04:03] [Music]
[2:04:06] her mind was settled
[2:04:09] when you died I would die where you are
[2:04:11] buried I will be buried
[2:04:16] call her whatever you want to call her
[2:04:20] it did not bother her
[2:04:21] because she had purpose in her heart
[2:04:24] when Daniel purpose in his heart that
[2:04:27] you will not Define himself
[2:04:29] with the Babylon Emile he never knew
[2:04:32] that it would take him to the lion Den
[2:04:35] foreign
