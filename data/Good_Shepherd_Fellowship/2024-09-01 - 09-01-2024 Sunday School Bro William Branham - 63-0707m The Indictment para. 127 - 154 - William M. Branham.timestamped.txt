[3:28] what did he class him a fanatic
[3:30] a crazy man yeah they found fault with
[3:33] the man who was the word he was the word
[3:36] St John first chapter proves it in the
[3:39] beginning was the word and the word is
[3:40] with God and the Word was made flesh and
[3:43] dwelt among us he was the Living Word of
[3:47] God because he was expressing God
[3:49] through himself he was so completely to
[3:52] surrender to the to the word of God to
[3:54] him the word was a saint and that's
[3:57] exactly what the church ought to be
[3:58] today that the word of God is the same
[4:01] how can you be part of that word when
[4:02] you deny practically all of it and the
[4:05] reason it's done is not because the
[4:07] people that's the reason I think God
[4:09] spoke to me about calling his people the
[4:11] Ricks and ricettas it's because of these
[4:14] selfish denominations has got those
[4:16] people living out there in the way
[4:17] they're living They Crucified the truth
[4:19] and the people call it a blasphemy and
[4:21] they make it blasphemy rather they call
[4:23] it fanaticism and so forth and not
[4:25] knowing that they're blaspheming the
[4:26] very God that they go to church to serve
[4:30] therefore I indict this bunch of clergy
[4:32] today I indict this generation in the
[4:35] name of Jesus Christ under the authority
[4:37] of God's word you're are crucifying him
[4:41] again
[4:43] notice he's the same yesterday day and
[4:45] forever God's word are Vindicated in the
[4:49] man compare the two calvaries and their
[4:54] acquisation remember because he made
[4:57] himself God
[5:00] we will not have this man rule over us
[5:03] what was the acquisation that they could
[5:04] find in the council that morning uh when
[5:07] crucified Jesus that he made himself God
[5:11] he was
[5:13] God and he broke the Sabbath and he was
[5:15] the lord of the
[5:17] Sabbath they condemned him because that
[5:19] he made himself
[5:22] God you have no right to do this you
[5:24] have no right our high priest if
[5:26] anything is coming come through our
[5:27] priest now compare that with the calvary
[5:30] today when God it so pleased the father
[5:35] God the spirit to raised up his own son
[5:39] overshadowed the Mary by the Holy Spirit
[5:42] and brought forth a body that could
[5:44] serve him and serve his purpose to the
[5:47] God was in Christ the fullness of the
[5:49] godhead bodily in him reflecting what
[5:52] God was to the people letting the
[5:54] letting the whole world know what God
[5:56] wanted each individual to be a son and
[5:58] daughter he took one man and did it and
[6:01] because that he didn't jar with their
[6:03] organizational ranks they condemned him
[6:07] in
[6:07] crucified now compare that Calvary with
[6:10] the
[6:12] day because of organizational Prejudice
[6:17] yes because of indifference between
[6:20] Scholars who ought to know God's word
[6:24] and plan because of this God can take a
[6:27] little group of people that he can work
[6:29] to somewhere and refect himself who will
[6:31] humble themselves to the word and they
[6:34] cannot say it isn't
[6:36] so they could not say he didn't do it
[6:39] for their congregation was witness of it
[6:43] it was before them they couldn't deny it
[6:47] they couldn't deny his claims because
[6:50] the very word that they said they
[6:52] believe was the one who prove that he
[6:55] was because God took the word that was
[6:57] supposed to be the Messiah and show to a
[7:00] man and they had to get rid of
[7:02] him so the only way they could go on was
[7:04] get rid of the
[7:06] Messiah and they did it through
[7:09] blindness and ignorance regardless of
[7:13] their education they were smart
[7:16] intelligent worldly speaking as we
[7:19] compared the other night when the light
[7:20] struck the rich rung ruler look what he
[7:22] did he rejected a smart man Paul another
[7:27] smart man the light struck him what' he
[7:28] do he accepted it
[7:30] it he forgot all he ever know that he
[7:33] might know Christ am that made his life
[7:36] worthy of the Gospel last Sunday night's
[7:39] message there it is today it strikes
[7:42] maybe some little a man is went off had
[7:44] a call of God he felt went to some
[7:46] Seminary and learned some Creed he must
[7:48] live by that Creed or give up his
[7:51] Fellowship card if he does he's black
[7:53] mark nobody else will have him because
[7:56] once he belonged to something else and
[7:57] now he don't belong to it they figure
[8:00] there's something wrong with that man
[8:02] and they will not have him in their
[8:04] congregation when the congregation are
[8:06] only looking for one sign that is if he
[8:08] believes what they believe if he's got a
[8:11] card if he's a Methodist if he's a card
[8:13] he belongs to another fellowship or Wess
[8:15] or trinitarian or whatever it might be
[8:17] Church of God or in the Pentecostal
[8:19] ranks all those ranks if he packs a card
[8:22] that feel that the headquarters has uh
[8:24] looked him over and tested his mind and
[8:27] give him a psychiatrist test and see if
[8:29] his IQ was high enough that he could
[8:31] speak before him if you don't they turn
[8:33] him down that's right but you see the
[8:36] congregation ought to be watching the
[8:38] hand of the Lord see whether God's giv
[8:41] his ordination or not that's what we
[8:43] ought to be looking at Hallelujah but
[8:45] today they crucify the the the Son of
[8:48] God aresh when a man is Able by the
[8:50] grace of God be called of God to let God
[8:53] reflect himself through him the works
[8:55] that I do shall you do also he said
[8:58] notice
[8:59] what a day that we're living in they
[9:02] they take they they take the the very
[9:05] Calvary we can this morning and the very
[9:08] reason now they know that was truth but
[9:11] because of jealousy Prejudice what did
[9:14] Jesus say to them if I cast out Devils
[9:16] by the Finger of God then who who do you
[9:19] cast them out by let them be your judge
[9:22] if I by the Finger of God cast out
[9:24] Devils now it's like you heard them say
[9:26] can you prove it's a finger of God I'd
[9:27] like to I'd like to heard that question
[9:29] nasty they were too smart for
[9:34] that notice because that he made himself
[9:38] God and he was
[9:40] God and we will not have him rule over
[9:43] us but now the thing the same old cry
[9:46] comes
[9:47] again that Bible was written by man they
[9:50] say we don't have to live by that that's
[9:54] God's that's God's word it's God himself
[9:59] I was talking to a man you I saidwell
[10:01] some man might have wrote that Bible I
[10:03] said yes it was his name we know him as
[10:06] God it was Wroten 4,000 years apart
[10:10] almost the scriptures back from Job all
[10:13] the way to the New Testament and wrote
[10:15] by hundred by by and hundreds of years
[10:18] apart and was wrote by different man and
[10:21] them not knowing the other in different
[10:22] parts of the country and not one word of
[10:24] it will condemn the
[10:26] other right I dare anybody to come under
[10:30] the blood of Jesus Christ and claim any
[10:32] promise in there God's obligated to take
[10:35] care of it but they won't do it they'll
[10:37] come say oh Lord I want to do something
[10:39] give me a great gift Hallelujah Lord
[10:41] glory to God I believe I got it
[10:42] Hallelujah it'll never
[10:44] work you might bring forth a lot of
[10:46] psychology but it won't
[10:48] work God's got to recognize that
[10:51] repentance God's got to do
[10:54] that we could say a lot along that line
[10:57] but I hope you're you're understanding
[10:59] look but now they won't have the word
[11:02] rule over them I say every one of you
[11:05] returned back you're baptized wrong
[11:07] you're baptized in the Catholic Church
[11:08] who are you to tell us that it's not me
[11:10] it's a
[11:11] word well I tell you we we believe I
[11:13] don't care what you believe it's what
[11:14] the Bible says well we don't have to
[11:17] live by that you do not or you're under
[11:19] the Judgment of this Bible for whosoever
[11:21] shall take one word out of it or add one
[11:23] to it the same will be taken out of the
[11:25] part of The Book of Life let him be
[11:26] Minister clergyman whoever he is you you
[11:29] got to come under the rulership of this
[11:31] word for it is God the Bible says it's
[11:35] God we won't have it rule over us they
[11:37] take their Creeds and denominations and
[11:40] their little petty things that they
[11:42] believe in has been adopted by councils
[11:44] of man and take it instead of God's word
[11:48] what did they do they tuck a
[11:50] barabus a murderer instead of the Son of
[11:54] God at the day of the first crucifixion
[11:56] and today they're taking some man's word
[11:58] which is a lie and the way of death and
[12:01] refusing to take the way of life God's
[12:03] word I condemn this generation and died
[12:06] in the word of the Lord that they're
[12:08] wrong they're guilty of crucifixion or
[12:12] trying to Hallelujah crucify the spirit
[12:16] they call for Revival everywhere how you
[12:19] going to have a Revival when the word
[12:20] itself can't work to the
[12:22] people I'd like for somebody to answer
[12:24] that for me how can it do when you deny
[12:27] the very Revival itself
[12:30] amen well did the prophet speak of
[12:33] them forms of godliness their own forms
[12:37] back there deny the Word of Life their
[12:39] own Farms today deny the thing that can
[12:42] bring them a
[12:43] Revival their Creeds and
[12:46] Farms yes sir they take the denomination
[12:50] and their Creeds instead of the the
[12:54] word and that crucifies his word and
[12:58] makes his word of no effect to the
[13:00] people when they see the word of God so
[13:04] vividly in it just Place
[13:07] itself that God made the promise he
[13:10] would do this and here he is doing it
[13:12] and they make fun of
[13:14] it and get away from it it's
[13:18] blasphemy and they try to crucify the
[13:21] word itself why do they crucify they
[13:23] can't crucify the word no more they
[13:24] could crucify God they could crucify the
[13:27] body that help God the Son of God they
[13:30] could crucify that but they can't
[13:31] crucify God he had to be that time on
[13:34] account of being the sacrifice to bring
[13:36] in many sons that's predestinated to
[13:38] eternal life they had to do it then but
[13:41] they can't do it now they can't do it
[13:44] for the word itself will live on but
[13:46] they what do they do how do they form
[13:48] what are you saying that preacher how
[13:50] you building your platform here that
[13:51] they crucifying that they're crucifying
[13:54] the effects of the Gospel upon the
[13:56] people by their Creeds amen yes that's a
[14:00] crucifixion that where the public set
[14:02] these big
[14:04] margs called churches denominations and
[14:07] draw a line of
[14:09] creed and that had the word of God can't
[14:13] have an effect upon it because they they
[14:15] condemn the very things that Christ said
[14:17] would take place it just don't come
[14:20] according to their Creed and neither did
[14:22] Jesus come according to their
[14:24] understanding of him coming he come in
[14:26] the way that God sent him and he come
[14:28] exactly with the word no wonder he said
[14:30] he hid it from the eyes of the wise and
[14:32] prudent and reveal it the baby such as
[14:34] would learn Hallelujah do you
[14:38] understand oh they have crucify the
[14:41] effects of the word I got a bunch of
[14:43] scriptures here I might just quote to a
[14:44] three of them they crucified you say how
[14:46] do they crucify the word when Jesus said
[14:49] that he's the same yesterday today and
[14:51] forever Hebrews 138 they say in such a
[14:54] way he
[14:55] is all right and the Jesus said his last
[14:59] commandment to the church go ye into all
[15:00] the World Mark 16 go ye into all the
[15:03] world and preach the gospel these signs
[15:05] shall follow them that believe all the
[15:08] world to Every Creature it ain't half
[15:10] reached yet and his millions die every
[15:13] year that don't ever even heard the name
[15:14] of Jesus so it's still the general
[15:17] orders it's still the Commandment of God
[15:20] all the world and preach the gospel to
[15:22] Every Creature he that believeth in his
[15:23] baptized shall be saved he that
[15:25] believeth not shall be damned and these
[15:27] signs shall follow them that believe in
[15:29] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[15:32] shall speak with new tongues if they
[15:34] take up serpents or drink deadly things
[15:35] it shall not harm them if they lay their
[15:37] hands on the sick they shall
[15:40] recover and they say that was for that
[15:43] generation and they make the Commandment
[15:45] of God of not effect to this and they
[15:47] crucify the effect of the word to the
[15:51] people
[15:53] amen Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[15:56] with the keys to the kingdom of Jesus
[15:58] had just G
[15:59] whatever you say here I'll say it up
[16:01] there and on the day of Pentecost they
[16:04] asked what they might do to receive the
[16:06] holy spirit that they was so enjoying it
[16:09] watching others acting uh what they
[16:11] would call uh silly stagger and jump and
[16:15] fall and acting like they were
[16:17] drunk and they say these men are full of
[16:19] new
[16:20] wine but there was a man stood up by the
[16:23] name of Peter who had the keys to the
[16:25] kingdom and said these are not drunken
[16:27] acts two as you supposed since the third
[16:30] ey of the day but this is that which is
[16:32] spoken of see right back to the word
[16:35] again showing that the spirit is still
[16:38] word the word is still Spirit yes the
[16:40] word of God and it shall come spoken by
[16:43] the prophet Joel Joel 238 and it shall
[16:45] come to pass in the last days sayith God
[16:48] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[16:50] listen to that Prophet stand there look
[16:53] at him
[16:54] Fearless standing there upon that bunch
[16:57] and condemning him
[16:59] amen indict
[17:01] them said this is the scripture this is
[17:05] that that was spoke of by the prophet I
[17:07] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your
[17:10] sons and daughters shall prophesy all my
[17:12] handmaids and Maid servant I pour out of
[17:14] my spirit now show signs in the heavens
[17:16] above and on Earth fire and pillars of
[17:17] smoke and
[17:19] Vapor proven it by the word that it was
[17:22] the word and they laughed and made fun
[17:24] of it and they went to judgment and the
[17:26] city was burnt and they eat one another
[17:28] children and today there are scattered
[17:30] people throughout all the
[17:33] world showing the Holy Spirit Still
[17:37] Remains the word of God to bring this
[17:38] word to make it live Jesus Christ was
[17:40] the person man
[17:42] God hallelujah
[17:45] amen he was the manifestation of God he
[17:50] was God in a body form to reflect the
[17:53] word of God for that age to make that
[17:56] age see God's promise for that age am
[17:59] and the Holy Ghost is the same thing
[18:01] today it's the spirit of God upon the
[18:03] written word trying to find somebody to
[18:05] reflect itself to this
[18:08] age to prove that he's the same
[18:10] yesterday ver St John 14:12 The Works
[18:13] that I do shall you also Jesus Christ
[18:15] the same yesterday day and forever see
[18:18] constantly trying to find its way to
[18:20] reflect itself and they could not do it
[18:22] the people thought so much of their
[18:23] denominations their little Nest that
[18:25] they had and so forth call their
[18:26] churches so they wouldn't listen to it
[18:29] so do they do it today same thing
[18:32] crucify aresh Peter on the day of
[18:35] Pentecost he said you man that dwell in
[18:37] Jerusalem in
[18:39] Judea hearken to my words these are not
[18:42] drunk if you'll stand still I'll show
[18:45] you what it is and he goes ahead and
[18:48] explains to them one of their hearts is
[18:50] pricked when they heard this say what
[18:52] can we do to be saved what can we do to
[18:55] receive this we're convinced that your
[18:58] word is right
[18:59] he said repent every one of you and be
[19:01] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[19:03] the remission of your sins and you shall
[19:06] receive the gift the Holy Ghost for this
[19:07] is to you and your children them as far
[19:09] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[19:11] shall call this is what they got to do
[19:13] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[19:15] Christ and today the Roman Catholic
[19:18] Church adopted father son Holy Ghost to
[19:21] take that place instead of that a
[19:23] communion Li out a tongue and take a
[19:25] wafer and the priest drink the wine and
[19:26] you're one together the communion
[19:28] instead of being the Holy Ghost called
[19:30] Holy
[19:31] Eucharist and a father son Holy Ghost a
[19:34] trinitarian baptism was not even spoke
[19:35] of in the Bible amen amen the name of
[19:38] father son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus
[19:40] Christ and when you show that to this
[19:42] honor generation as Peter said save
[19:44] yourself from this honor generation when
[19:47] you show it to them what do they do make
[19:50] fun of it and say our church don't teach
[19:51] it that way then you're guilty you're
[19:55] guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus
[19:58] Christ by taking the power of God away
[20:01] from the people you crucify the very
[20:03] word to them and you condemn yourself
[20:06] with your
[20:08] congregation lead him into a death
[20:11] trap as I said about that Minister last
[20:14] Sunday there Martin Luther King down
[20:16] there with them precious people leading
[20:19] right into a death trap oh somebody
[20:21] could only talk to that man wish I
[20:24] could just for an little uprising of the
[20:27] school proposition see some what
[20:29] difference my goodness if the people
[20:31] ain't got hard enough to associate with
[20:32] a man because of his color they're
[20:34] condemned and dead anyhow amen the
[20:37] nation gives right don't fight against
[20:38] it don't what if somebody said all the
[20:40] Irish or somebody all the German or
[20:42] somebody else had to dissociate that
[20:44] would never bother Christians and move
[20:46] right on and that man's a Christian is
[20:48] is a minister he shouldn't lead them
[20:49] people into a revolt against that
[20:51] they're going to cause Millions to die
[20:53] it'll start another revolutionary and
[20:54] it's a shame to do that the same thing
[20:57] happens right here exactly the same
[20:59] thing again that's right see the people
[21:02] how that they'd only look at truth and
[21:04] see what truth is our church don't
[21:07] believe that we got some other way well
[21:09] it ain't the right way it ain't the
[21:11] thing he said repent and be baptized in
[21:13] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[21:15] remission of sins now they won't do it
[21:18] oh then what do they do now that's just
[21:21] one thing upon hundreds we'll get to
[21:23] maybe as fast as we can now the second
[21:27] crucifixion then
[21:29] if a man accepts Father Son and Holy
[21:31] Spirit a a Creed instead of the
[21:35] word titles instead of the name what
[21:39] does he do to the people he crucifies
[21:42] the effects of the word to the people
[21:45] when he says that Mark 16 was just for
[21:47] that generation and God said himself
[21:50] right there Jesus talking to him said go
[21:51] you into all the world and preach the
[21:53] gospel to Every
[21:55] Creature he that believeth in his
[21:57] baptized shall be saved he that
[21:59] believeth not shall be damned and these
[22:01] signs shall follow
[22:03] them how for every nation every Creed
[22:07] every tongue every race every people the
[22:10] same
[22:11] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[22:14] that believe am and when a man tries to
[22:18] cut that out of the Bible he crucifies
[22:20] the effects of the Gospel to that
[22:21] congregation amen hallelujah so I indict
[22:25] you in the name of Jesus Christ you're
[22:28] guilty of murdering the
[22:30] Lord
[22:33] hallelujah the church hated him why he
[22:37] was their very God they hated him and
[22:40] denied
[22:42] him to be their Messiah no sir they
[22:47] didn't want such a messiah as that and
[22:50] today the church does the same thing it
[22:53] denies a word they don't want it it's
[22:56] contradictory to what they've been
[22:57] taught to believe by their reads amen
[23:00] and the word is the
[23:02] Messiah you believe that what the
[23:05] reflection of the word then is what amen
[23:09] a reflecting the
[23:11] Messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us
[23:14] he's reflecting himself try not too
[23:16] worry if he find a lamp that he can look
[23:18] through it ain't smoked up with Creeds
[23:19] and
[23:20] things he can give light
[23:23] through remember they Rose and trimmed
[23:26] their lamps and washed out the chimneys
[23:27] but it's too late so when a man sees
[23:29] these Lutheran Presbyterian methodists
[23:31] trying to come in these last dayses to
[23:33] receive the Holy Ghost why you know they
[23:35] don't get it that's right oh they might
[23:37] speak in tongues and jump up and down
[23:39] but Watch What Happens they absolutely
[23:42] it's a Time sign that she's
[23:44] over we're at the end most any time the
[23:47] the church could hear the challenge to
[23:49] come on high amen
[23:52] amen just exactly setting us in the
[23:54] order the Holy Spirit here making Jesus
[23:57] Christ a reality through the ones that
[23:59] he can work through proving himself come
[24:01] down takes his picture shows it makes
[24:03] signs te talk about it everything else
[24:04] proving just exactly what he said he
[24:06] would do doing exactly the things he
[24:08] said he would do scripturally not not
[24:10] some Creed or some man's worked up idea
[24:13] a lot of blood fire and smok and stuff
[24:14] but a scriptural Messiah
[24:17] evidence got a lot of impersonations and
[24:19] impersonators and and so forth but that
[24:22] only makes a real word shine its best
[24:24] that's right that's people who are
[24:26] spiritual who can judge between right
[24:28] and wrong
[24:30] denies him denied their Messiah we
[24:32] didn't want him the same thing they do
[24:34] today well if I had to go down there and
[24:36] act like that bunch I don't want it at
[24:38] all all right then you don't have it at
[24:40] all that's
[24:41] all same now although he was properly
[24:46] identified they didn't want him they
[24:48] hated him why was it we call their
[24:51] pastors a bunch of snakes he said you
[24:54] bunch of whiteed walls you're nothing
[24:56] but a graveyard the out of his polished
[24:59] with robes and turned around collars and
[25:00] the insides Dead Man's
[25:04] Bon he didn't pull no punches one a
[25:06] little bitty galileon a carpenter son
[25:10] but he didn't pull no punches he told
[25:12] him don't think John said the Forerunner
[25:15] of it said he's another didn't pull any
[25:16] punches he said don't come around here
[25:18] saying now you got Abraham to our father
[25:21] God's able to these Stones R children of
[25:22] Abraham yes sir the axes laid to the
[25:25] root of the tree and every tree that
[25:26] don't bring forth fruits HED Down cast
[25:28] Into the Fire yes sir God is strict and
[25:31] firm and Stern with his word yes sir
[25:35] notice Jesus proven by the scripture do
[25:39] you hear me
[25:41] am Jesus was
[25:44] identified by God through the scriptures
[25:47] that he was
[25:51] Messiah is that
[25:54] right we get to Peter's indictment a few
[25:56] minutes you'll find out where that was
[25:59] he was thoroughly
[26:00] identified that he was God manifested in
[26:05] a man called the Son of God that's
[26:08] right although he was properly
[26:10] identified and Vindicated the promised
[26:13] word that he was
[26:16] Messiah Moses said this Messiah when he
[26:19] comes he'll be a prophet and all these
[26:21] things will take place the little woman
[26:23] with the stand at the well and all that
[26:26] dirty condition that she was what that
[26:28] symbolize that God in these last days
[26:31] would pull out
[26:32] Outcast remember last night at the
[26:34] wedding or the other time I preacher at
[26:36] the wedding supper he sin how they said
[26:38] I've made a great feast and so forth and
[26:41] all these men I bit them and each one
[26:42] had an excuse I can't do it because it
[26:44] would ruin our Creeds I can't come
[26:47] because I have a uh uh my married a wife
[26:50] she won't let me come my I I got married
[26:53] to a church down here my mother was
[26:54] Methodist or Baptist or Catholic or I
[26:56] just can't stand for that
[26:59] he said and you won't come and you won't
[27:02] taste my supper but get out there and
[27:04] compel prostitutes and harlots and
[27:07] drunkards and whatever there is bring
[27:09] them in I'll straighten them up

[27:38] all right properly a Vindicated
[27:42] Messiah properly a Vindicated the word
[27:45] the promised word the god that promised
[27:48] the word that this what the Messiah
[27:50] would be here he come and stood exactly
[27:52] and he said to him now where have I
[27:55] failed if you can't believe me as a man
[27:58] believe the works that I do for they are
[28:02] the things that tell who I
[28:04] am they're the ones that says I'm
[28:07] Messiah you don't want to believe me

[28:40] where did you get this it anyhow and the
[28:42] Bible said he was a is
[28:44] offended he said many mighty Works he
[28:47] could not do and just turned his back
[28:48] and walked away from him he said a
[28:50] prophet's not without honor except his
[28:52] among his own
[28:53] people in his own County watch or in his
[28:56] own country
[28:58] there he is properly Vindicated the
[29:01] Messiah took no credit of his own he
[29:03] said I can do nothing but what I see the
[29:05] father doing and he challenged them to
[29:08] asked if that was the Messiah and look
[29:10] at that
