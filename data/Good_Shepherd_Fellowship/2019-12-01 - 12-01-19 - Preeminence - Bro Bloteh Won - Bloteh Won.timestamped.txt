[11:08] [Music]
[11:11] [Applause]
[11:11] [Music]
[12:09] when we are
[12:10] [Music]
[12:31] hey you may be seated Saints ago I've
[12:36] got a no chair brother Dan as a
[12:38] testimony is that is that today here's
[12:40] an old note oh that's good or you just
[12:43] come right back up here and tell me
[12:47] [Music]
[12:48] you know sheep have four stomachs a man
[12:52] they digest it and then they bring it
[12:54] back up and they digest it again tastes
[12:56] good just as much the second time as it
[12:59] did the first one
[13:02] god bless you since yes
[13:08] this testimony was actually about what
[13:13] went on last week there were a lot of
[13:17] storms that came my way and it you know
[13:23] after brother Darrell came and preached
[13:25] it was a very wonderful moment with the
[13:28] Lord and you know in moments like that
[13:34] after moments like that you can expect
[13:36] anything to happen because the devil is
[13:38] very upset and he's going to come back
[13:41] at you so what actually happened the
[13:44] Monday after that Sunday achieve entered
[13:47] into my car and then they just ransacked
[13:51] I had a lot of valuables in the truck I
[13:53] don't know what it took but a lot of
[13:57] tents were taken so and I had I always
[14:02] keep my wallet some of the times in the
[14:04] truck but for some reason that they I
[14:06] didn't keep it day I don't have much on
[14:09] that wallet by the only concern I had
[14:12] was the company credit card I have which
[14:16] has unlimited funds and if they had
[14:20] taken it it was easy to block it but I
[14:24] was kind of imagining sometimes I would
[14:26] live home are to something to go to wake
[14:29] and I was wondering what would happen if
[14:31] I had walked into them probably they
[14:33] were armed and then they seized you at
[14:35] gunpoint and then they carry you away
[14:38] and who knows what is going to happen so
[14:41] I just saw the hand of God right there
[14:44] and that's the same day in the afternoon
[14:46] I was driving with my wife to go to
[14:49] Danny's place and a truck just left it's
[14:53] lame and then crossed my lane and then
[14:55] went to the next Lane and stopped I mean
[14:58] who does that
[14:59] it was very weird but thank God and
[15:02] nothing happened and I went to whack no
[15:06] that's same night I had two terrible
[15:09] dreams I went to work the following day
[15:12] and I have never been distracted on
[15:16] job like that very day I was so
[15:19] distracted more than 10 times there were
[15:23] terrorism's why everything was supposed
[15:25] to go wrong but by the grace of God it
[15:28] never happened there one time that it
[15:30] happened I was supposed to add some
[15:32] ingredient to a mix which I didn't do
[15:36] ain't had already gone through the
[15:37] system so I just prayed over it and I
[15:41] asked God to sign it and you to win add
[15:43] that whichever way God did it I don't
[15:47] know that you know normally they will
[15:49] detect that downstream on the system
[15:52] nothing was detected and I knew that the
[15:57] grace of God had prevailed that same day
[16:01] there was water 180 degree water I saw
[16:05] it just gushing out I was on a phone
[16:08] which how did I call it
[16:12] these people you know because my
[16:18] identity theft to protect my identity
[16:20] information I was on the phone with them
[16:23] because I don't know what information
[16:25] that people have taken and I went out
[16:29] Kim walked right back into the 180
[16:31] degree water with my left foot in fact a
[16:36] lot of things happened now the last of
[16:39] it
[16:39] I wouldn't say the last of it I have
[16:42] been through the storm all this week
[16:44] back the last of those series I hung a
[16:48] super sack of corn flour which is 2,000
[16:52] pounds and normally you will guide it
[16:54] into a hopper and then you take there
[16:57] are two roofs you take the first one out
[16:59] then you take the second one then it
[17:01] will just drop when I was trying to open
[17:04] the Rope it wouldn't open so I used a
[17:07] knife and then I cut open it and then I
[17:10] put out the ropes so I pulled out a rope
[17:13] and the inner rope and a 2,000 pound of
[17:17] coneflower was hanging in the air about
[17:19] seven feet and it didn't come down so I
[17:24] guided it all the way to the hopper as
[17:27] soon as he got there it just dropped
[17:29] that was when I got to know that it was
[17:32] opened but it was just a miracle they
[17:36] didn't just drop on the floor God held
[17:40] it until a go to weight was supposed to
[17:42] be before it was opened and I saw that
[17:47] devil made a move every single time God
[17:50] countered that move we are serving a
[17:53] living God let your faith be in God to
[17:57] put your trust in him he will never let
[17:59] you down

[33:13] be a song leader everybody else getting
[33:15] up there and helping you so a man just
[33:19] appreciate you all so much and he asked
[33:22] me if I would share a couple things from
[33:24] our trip and we drove almost 2800 miles
[33:30] in one week so we had a wonderful time
[33:33] on the road anyway we went down for
[33:37] brother David Wright's memorial service
[33:39] our dear brother that went to be with
[33:41] the Lord and about three weeks ago and
[33:45] so we on the way down we actually stayed
[33:49] at brother Mike Pinkston Mike and Connie
[33:51] pinks and old friends of ours who used
[33:53] to be in our assembly here and they
[33:55] certainly send their greetings
[33:57] a man it was good to be with them again
[33:58] and we actually stayed with him one
[34:01] night on the way down and one night on
[34:02] the way back and we were actually down
[34:06] by a little town called Mount Holly
[34:08] which was in the northwest side of
[34:09] Charlotte North Carolina and we got
[34:13] there in the evening before the memorial
[34:15] service and brother David Wright's
[34:18] oldest daughter Teresa invited those
[34:22] that were coming from out of town to
[34:23] come over they had a little supper there
[34:25] and there was a hole there was a large
[34:27] group from Toronto brother from brother
[34:32] Dan Quayle's Church and also from
[34:34] brother Gerard's Samuel Gerard Church a
[34:37] couple of churches that brother David
[34:39] had really ministered to quite a bit up
[34:43] there probably more than any other
[34:44] Church I think as far as when he
[34:46] traveled he was with them and so and so
[34:50] we had a wonderful time there brother
[34:53] Gerald Hughes and his wife Cheryl send
[34:56] their greetings
[34:56] I hadn't seen brother Gerald since 1990
[34:59] when we had the appreciation dinner for
[35:02] brother Baird back in December of 1990
[35:05] so 29 years since I'd seen her brother
[35:08] and so oh my time just goes by so fast
[35:13] and kind of made me feel sad in the
[35:16] sense that to let so much time go by
[35:19] between times of seeing somebody but he
[35:23] and his wife's and greetings and I think
[35:26] they're for the bought he would like to
[35:27] have him up to preach he's an old
[35:30] veteran and he'd like to come up to
[35:32] Minnesota once again so he sends his
[35:35] greetings also brother Dwight Hall some
[35:39] of the Steve sister Kelly he was there
[35:42] for the memorial service and so we had a
[35:44] chance to talk he sends his greetings to
[35:46] the church here
[35:48] he came and preached a couple of times
[35:50] and he he also sings he has this
[35:53] beautiful mellow voice and certainly
[35:57] they had that for the memorial service
[35:58] he and brother Gerald got up there and
[36:01] and saying see the bright light shine of
[36:04] course we all helped him too so a man so
[36:07] he sends his greetings and of course
[36:10] brother Dan quoi sends his greetings
[36:13] also a lot of wonderful brethren we
[36:19] hadn't actually seen Rebekah we hadn't
[36:23] seen her they actually brother David
[36:24] lived up here in Minnesota when we used
[36:28] to go to brother Barrett's church they
[36:30] were here in 1983 1984 so that was the
[36:34] last time I believe that I we had seen
[36:36] Rebekah his youngest daughter so she
[36:39] lives up there right up there in Mount
[36:41] Holly along with her sister Teresa and
[36:44] so um so it hadn't been even longer but
[36:49] since we had seen her and then we after
[36:53] that we traveled up to
[36:57] Toledo Ohio brother John and
[36:59] sister-in-law Fontaine we have spent the
[37:02] day with them and this actually this
[37:04] past Monday they send their greetings
[37:06] brother Paul la Fontaine sends his
[37:09] greeting he and Sharon and of course
[37:11] we're the BLA T has asked with a pole to
[37:13] come up and preach and and brother Paul
[37:16] confess that that he still hasn't
[37:19] fulfilled his obligation and so but yet
[37:24] he still didn't give us a definite day
[37:27] and time that he would be here so but
[37:29] we're coming back he said he would come
[37:32] we just don't know and so brother John
[37:50] had been diagnosed oh it was about I
[37:53] think four or five months ago with four
[37:55] stage cancer and he's doing well and he
[37:59] told us specifically tell everybody that
[38:02] I am a four stage cancer survivor so we
[38:17] were up there in Toledo we'd got there
[38:18] Sunday night and then stayed until
[38:20] Tuesday morning and I would be remiss
[38:24] brother Steve to tell you I was actually
[38:27] we had left there we were heading back
[38:30] through Indiana and I said I had to call
[38:34] brother Steve because Elkhart Indiana is
[38:37] kind of his home stomping grounds from
[38:39] many years ago and so I had to call him
[38:41] and say brother what is that restaurant
[38:44] that you always say that we ought to and
[38:46] I've been there a few times and believe
[38:48] me it's never disappointed amen so I
[38:52] just have to say that we found
[38:54] callaghan's restaurants so if you ever
[38:56] going through Elkhart Indiana you must
[38:57] stop there ordered the omelet potatoes
[39:01] and the pancakes I ate the two pancakes
[39:04] and that was enough I couldn't eat
[39:05] anymore I did pack the rest out
[39:08] the omelet was the size of a small
[39:10] football she absolutely get their
[39:14] money's worth when you go there so but I
[39:18] always thought you know there are
[39:20] different places where I visited it I
[39:21] always look for that that little cafe in
[39:24] a little town and whatever town or deals
[39:26] there's always one where the old-timers
[39:28] get together and I fit right in and so
[39:31] I've done that with most Eva I've been
[39:33] like out in Arizona when there's a place
[39:36] out there up in Sedona and I just had to
[39:40] call him because they had 101 different
[39:41] omelets and I thought I had to tell her
[39:44] the Steve above that so amen so I didn't
[39:46] mean to get on food I hope y'all eat
[39:48] breakfast this morning so any matter but
[39:50] I had to tell him that because I wish
[39:52] brother Steve and sister Kelly could
[39:54] travel like a thot and just be with us
[39:55] there at the restaurant and he told he
[39:58] reminded me of his good friend Marvin
[40:00] and I said well what does he look like
[40:03] and I said and he told me and he's bald
[40:06] thinner than him a little bit taller and
[40:09] so sure enough brother I didn't just get
[40:11] up and I now ask if Marvin was there but
[40:14] I did see a couple of fellows that were
[40:16] bald and had wore glasses and so I went
[40:20] over there and asked him if their name
[40:21] was Marvin so didn't didn't turn out
[40:25] this time but maybe next time so that's
[40:29] all right if they think I'm crazier than
[40:31] then you're right so amen you know we we
[40:35] actually had planned on being in
[40:37] Rockford Illinois on Tuesday night kind
[40:40] of the halfway point between Toledo is
[40:41] in Minneapolis and then stay overnight
[40:45] there and then come back Wednesday
[40:46] afternoon but we saw the weather reports
[40:49] even in Ohio they were saying they were
[40:51] going to be having 50 mile an hour winds
[40:53] on Wednesday and so the oh man I talked
[40:56] about and so we decided to push through

[41:02] day all the way and then when we got

[41:15] supposed to start snowing at 6 o'clock
[41:17] p.m. well about quarter after 6:00

[41:22] snowing so we only had 20 minute drive
[41:24] left and I got home and of course then
[41:28] that gave us the opportunity to get up

[1:09:40] to see brother Daniel back there and his
[1:09:42] wife and and big son here praise the
[1:09:47] Lord
[1:09:48] amen amen
[1:09:51] I want to speak a little bit on
[1:09:52] preeminence this morning
[1:09:59] I want to speak on preeminence this
[1:10:03] morning well what I would like to take
[1:10:05] over from from invisible Union if you've
[1:10:10] been following the tape just before the
[1:10:14] reading of the of the scripture brother
[1:10:18] Branham said this he says now in in
[1:10:24] Romans 7 trusting that you have your
[1:10:27] Bible open everywhere now across the
[1:10:32] country we want to reclose Lee this
[1:10:36] message out of year it seems like it's
[1:10:41] on marriage and divorce but it really
[1:10:44] isn't I mean he says to me it's a
[1:10:50] prophecy for the church in the last day
[1:10:57] amen
[1:10:58] then he's talking here on invisible
[1:11:01] Union and he's going to talk about the
[1:11:04] union that is between Christ and his
[1:11:06] bride and and he's taking now Romans
[1:11:13] chapter 7 and many of us we are off
[1:11:19] familias with Romans chapter 7 it was in
[1:11:23] Romans chapter 7 where Paul spoke about
[1:11:27] a year and he says know ye not brethren
[1:11:31] for I speak to them that know the Lord
[1:11:35] how that the Lord hath dominion over a
[1:11:37] man as long as he lived for the woman
[1:11:41] which heart and husband is bound by the
[1:11:45] law to her husband as long as he liveth
[1:11:48] but if the husband be dead she is loosed
[1:11:55] from the law of her husband and so then
[1:12:00] if while her husband liveth she be
[1:12:03] married to another man she shall be
[1:12:06] called an adulteress but if the husband
[1:12:10] be dead she is free from the law
[1:12:12] so there she is no adulteress though she
[1:12:16] be married to another man now so really
[1:12:23] from this trip sure that's what he's
[1:12:25] looking at and he's saying that in one
[1:12:30] sense it looks like a stripper that
[1:12:32] these with marish and their vows wish of
[1:12:35] course we go to that scripture many of
[1:12:37] the time when we want to you know we
[1:12:39] want to settle a problem of whether
[1:12:43] someone can get married again or net but
[1:12:47] you said he says the other poor being a
[1:12:53] prophet of the New Testament he's
[1:12:57] speaking on this and in one sense is a
[1:13:01] prophecy for the church in the last day
[1:13:05] and that is the reason why I think that
[1:13:09] that is that is a tense giving message
[1:13:12] for us because we can be grateful amen
[1:13:16] we have to know that God is obligated to
[1:13:19] his word he praise the Lord amen
[1:13:23] and God is bound by his own world praise
[1:13:27] the Lord
[1:13:27] now so if the Lord of God required both
[1:13:33] in the physical sense or the spiritual
[1:13:36] sense there that a woman wish of course
[1:13:40] types the church
[1:13:42] I have Elijah was asking me last Sunday
[1:13:46] you know he had some few questions to
[1:13:49] come and ask me you know how can we the
[1:13:52] brothers be the bride when the bride is
[1:13:55] a woman amen praise the Lord I thought
[1:13:59] that was interesting for a young man
[1:14:01] amen and also we had a little talk on
[1:14:04] there but we we the bride you know of
[1:14:08] Jesus Christ and and and knowing that it
[1:14:11] was that's the reason why brother
[1:14:13] Branham see a prophecy in this age in
[1:14:15] this last age because it was going to be
[1:14:18] in the last age that the bride was going
[1:14:22] to be called praise the Lord
[1:14:25] Brahe was not going to be called in in
[1:14:28] the age of the reformers praise the Lord
[1:14:31] and I want you to pay attention to me
[1:14:33] this morning because they are just some
[1:14:34] few things I would like to go down the
[1:14:38] line in and and that's what I want to
[1:14:40] speak on on preeminence this morning you
[1:14:44] know I have a little note here that I
[1:14:46] wrote down as mine inspiration the lack
[1:14:49] of preeminence taught to the Lord that's
[1:14:54] why we have a lot of impersonation of
[1:14:57] Christianity praise the Lord Amen
[1:15:02] because you see a woman can impersonate
[1:15:06] to be the wife of a man praise the Lord
[1:15:10] and she can dress like you know like
[1:15:14] like like like the wife she can try to
[1:15:17] do everything like the wife but she
[1:15:19] would just be impersonating but the
[1:15:22] requirement from from the scripture but
[1:15:25] a lot of God it would take a wife you
[1:15:29] know to to be able to give the husband
[1:15:32] preeminence cry supposed to take her
[1:15:38] preeminence on the bride but it would
[1:15:40] take the wife to give him that place
[1:15:46] he's not going to force it that's where
[1:15:49] it is that's where the mystery is he's
[1:15:53] not going to force himself upon you when
[1:15:59] you have come to that level in your
[1:16:01] relationship with God were you are a
[1:16:04] bride you will be glad for him to have
[1:16:08] the first place in everything you do
[1:16:13] brother Branham say he's a gentleman he
[1:16:16] don't abuse his wives amen
[1:16:19] whatever place you gave him he would
[1:16:22] gladly take it but he deserve the first
[1:16:26] and the best
[1:16:30] praise the Lord but if you put him in
[1:16:33] the back seat he will he would gladly
[1:16:35] ride in the back seat praise
[1:16:39] he put him in the trunk he might get
[1:16:42] there and he will even be in the trunk
[1:16:46] and keep you safe along the road that
[1:16:49] just how love it he is even though he
[1:16:52] deserve the first and the best
[1:16:55] well whatever place you give him he
[1:16:58] would take so that the thing about the
[1:17:00] mystery of preeminence it is it is the
[1:17:04] it is the man cries to have preeminence
[1:17:07] on his church on his bride but the
[1:17:11] mystery is that is a woman that is going
[1:17:14] to give him that place for him to take
[1:17:17] preeminence that's what Paul says I
[1:17:24] speak this as a mystery concerning
[1:17:26] Christ and the church
[1:17:29] I will together so he says here that
[1:17:37] Paul speak of this as a prophecy to the
[1:17:42] last date church for a year is giving an
[1:17:50] illustration out out of the scripture
[1:17:52] about the Lord and grace and
[1:17:55] illustrating it like marriage and
[1:17:58] divorce so he's taking Lord in grace how
[1:18:02] grace how on the Lord under the Lord of
[1:18:07] God we were born in sin shifflett in
[1:18:12] iniquity come to the word speaking lies
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:18] praise the Lord so by our natural birth
[1:18:23] we were we were we were born and and and
[1:18:30] condemned by the Lord of God praise the
[1:18:34] Lord now so this is word the
[1:18:38] illustration comes in where it becomes a
[1:18:41] prophecy it's in a place that by our
[1:18:44] natural birth we are born under the Lord
[1:18:47] of God and a lot of God required
[1:18:50] death as a penalty for scene Fraser law
[1:18:56] and we were born with that nature in us
[1:19:00] and now the Lord of God here requires
[1:19:04] that the first husband must be dead
[1:19:08] before we can be married
[1:19:15] praise the Lord
[1:19:17] so when grace comes in are we together
[1:19:23] when grace comes in and we been saved by
[1:19:29] grace which is God's love the love of
[1:19:35] God at Christ as pain I mean that's what
[1:19:42] grace is it's God's love at crisis
[1:19:48] Ping's the love of God comes in and God
[1:19:53] by grace save you
[1:19:56] amen so in another sense what grace is
[1:20:01] doing grace is destroying grace is
[1:20:05] killing the first husband bridge is is
[1:20:10] subjecting the first nature that
[1:20:13] dominated your life and until you are
[1:20:20] there that's the reason why we must be
[1:20:23] born again is not a church membership
[1:20:25] unless you are dead you cannot go into
[1:20:29] another marriage you can go into another
[1:20:36] marriage with Christ that is the reason
[1:20:38] why people play church they don't make
[1:20:40] it don't make no sense to them because
[1:20:41] the reality of grace have that sundown
[1:20:45] yet they are not really honest to what
[1:20:48] God is doing
[1:20:59] how we together so when grace comes in
[1:21:07] for year giving an illustration in the
[1:21:09] scripture about loading grace and
[1:21:12] illustrating it like marriage and
[1:21:14] divorce the passage is very sullen
[1:21:16] apprec-- on because is more or less 13-2
[1:21:20] like marriage in divorce but is also Pat
[1:21:24] into a greater portion of marriage and
[1:21:29] divorce and how there he is trying to
[1:21:31] sit in all the year as a church we can
[1:21:39] no more be married to the word that
[1:21:44] thinks of the word and to Christ at the
[1:21:46] same time you are just impersonating
[1:21:51] that you are a bride you are not a blind
[1:21:55] until the first man is dead you are just
[1:22:01] impersonating he's trying to sell in all
[1:22:12] the years us as a church we can no more
[1:22:18] be married to the word in Christ at the
[1:22:20] same time and be legal and lawful about
[1:22:26] it
[1:22:29] amen
[1:22:30] then it can be for a woman to be living
[1:22:33] with a husband why she she got a living
[1:22:36] hospital
[1:22:38] praise the Lord
[1:22:41] now you see that is the reason why
[1:22:45] invisible Union is a tense giving
[1:22:48] message to see what God has done for us
[1:22:55] praise the Lord
[1:22:57] by nature and by nature we are Gentiles
[1:23:04] we we are right down from from idolatry
[1:23:08] other worshipers we will worship
[1:23:10] anything
[1:23:12] we will wash him anything that's the
[1:23:15] reason why when a man does not have a
[1:23:17] real true born-again experience with
[1:23:19] Christ you know they can put anything
[1:23:21] before crimes because Gentile by nature
[1:23:25] we worship anything praise the Lord
[1:23:30] but to see that God in His mercy will
[1:23:36] step down in you know show us his love
[1:23:45] praise the Lord brother Branham says he
[1:23:48] would take the reign of America favor
[1:23:52] and slip it down our hands amen he would
[1:23:58] say that that he will you he would
[1:24:02] justified us and says you had never done
[1:24:07] it in the first place and as all of
[1:24:09] those things that were being brought in
[1:24:11] this message to just show how much we
[1:24:13] can be thankful that this is not just by
[1:24:17] church affiliation it's not because you
[1:24:21] say no I'm not a Baptist or a merriday
[1:24:23] and now in a message that makes you a
[1:24:25] bride are we together
[1:24:39] so we can be thankful for these things
[1:24:48] praise the Lord
[1:24:51] amen and those are some other things we
[1:24:56] want to look at this morning in and
[1:24:59] trust that the grace of God who helped
[1:25:02] us you know there he he talks in that
[1:25:05] message about your modal experience
[1:25:08] reading Romans chapter 7 in running
[1:25:12] running down the street asking for grace
[1:25:15] you know asking for grace he when he
[1:25:19] read that you know God just show a
[1:25:23] revelation to him you know most and
[1:25:25] people read the scripture him in pretty
[1:25:28] soon it brings other people into the
[1:25:30] picture and they're not even able to
[1:25:32] apply to themselves you know but the
[1:25:35] omadi saw grace rescuing him amen
[1:25:43] from from from the lord of sin and death
[1:25:46] but who have condemned him he ran down
[1:25:49] the street asking for grace do you know
[1:25:52] grace amen Amazing Grace praise the Lord
[1:25:57] Amen and that's what we want to talk
[1:25:59] about this morning I just want to travel
[1:26:03] with you a little bit and you know we're
[1:26:07] coming to to the close of another year
[1:26:12] then and the Lord has been good to us
[1:26:14] and you know different things but we
[1:26:19] have to know that you know the more we
[1:26:21] travel in this life the closer we get to
[1:26:24] the coming of the Lord every day brings
[1:26:27] us closer to the coming of the Lord
[1:26:29] praise the Lord and we want to make our
[1:26:36] call in our election show every day
[1:26:38] every moment every opportunity we have
[1:26:41] we want to make sure you know that we
[1:26:45] have we have put everything in order we
[1:26:47] have the blood on the lintel of the
[1:26:49] doorpost you know we have we just have
[1:26:51] everything you know
[1:26:52] we have everything unpack to get out of
[1:26:56] this place
[1:26:56] amen amen glory be to God so we will
[1:27:04] just be looking at some few things here
[1:27:06] as we as we as we just look at this you
[1:27:09] know I mean I've been thinking about
[1:27:11] that or through the weekend thinking
[1:27:12] about preeminence and to know that is is
[1:27:19] is a 3/4 mystery you know crisis the
[1:27:24] measure of gore evil it's a 3/4 mystery
[1:27:27] of one goal and and the first mystery
[1:27:31] was God to reveal himself and in the
[1:27:35] second one it's after he had make
[1:27:37] himself known to his people is to also
[1:27:40] have preeminence now you can see that
[1:27:43] over in Exeter when God told Moses to
[1:27:46] build a tabernacle he stole Moses the
[1:27:49] Moses you build a tabernacle because his
[1:27:52] desire was to come down and dwell among
[1:27:57] his people praise the Lord Amen the
[1:28:02] reason why he wanted that tabernacle was
[1:28:06] to have his presence and mourn his
[1:28:10] people praise the Lord
[1:28:12] that's the reason of the of the of the
[1:28:15] tabernacle and you know and and that is
[1:28:18] God greater sense of achievement when
[1:28:23] God can have his presence among his
[1:28:26] people
[1:28:26] this God we self is not a God I want to
[1:28:30] be in distance from you know he don't
[1:28:33] want to be in the distance God don't
[1:28:35] want you to know him by a secondhand
[1:28:38] experience he don't want you to have a
[1:28:41] passed down experience he want you to
[1:28:43] have a personal experience a daily
[1:28:47] experience and abiding experience
[1:28:53] praise the Lord Amen he want to go with
[1:28:56] you every day he want to dwell with you
[1:28:59] so I
[1:29:02] the second full purpose was for him to
[1:29:05] have a premium eNOS among his people and
[1:29:10] then the tariff for purpose now you have
[1:29:12] to realize it would takes the first and
[1:29:15] the second to be able to fulfill the
[1:29:17] tail the tail is to get us back to Eden
[1:29:22] praise the Lord and so when we're
[1:29:25] talking about a rapture and really in an
[1:29:27] in an expectation for the rapture then
[1:29:30] we we we also say in another sense that
[1:29:33] we want to get back to Eden and we're
[1:29:37] not going to get back to eating until
[1:29:40] God gather people that he had the
[1:29:43] preeminence praise the Lord Amen because
[1:29:51] their gear in eating there was on Adam
[1:29:55] and Eve and and go hard about the place
[1:30:00] word he had the preeminence because
[1:30:05] everything they were doing was told the
[1:30:08] desire amen fulfilling God's Word
[1:30:13] everything they were doing are we
[1:30:18] together blessed be the name of the law
[1:30:20] so we just want to take our time a
[1:30:23] little bit here and let's read this
[1:30:27] conference 1960 the need of the church
[1:30:31] tonight is a conference a prayer meeting
[1:30:35] a get-together call together ministers

[1:31:46] whatever we want to it will it will

[1:31:52] life of Christ being projected in you
[1:31:56] someone who someone whose tender and
[1:32:00] thankful and forgiving and ready to turn
[1:32:02] the other side of the cheek to gave a
[1:32:05] second thought

[1:32:11] action not just taught from the pulpit
[1:32:15] but uttered among the members among the
[1:32:20] pastor's that's when you see Christ
[1:32:23] living in the church amen
[1:32:27] praise the Lord the place is born is
[1:32:30] other autre when people can get back
[1:32:34] other water in their homes get back at
[1:32:37] the author on their knees surrounding
[1:32:41] himself that's where preeminence is born
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:47] so running in ourselves giving up you
[1:32:51] know our our desires and things that are
[1:32:54] so dear for to us and you know the ones
[1:32:56] that you know we tried and we tried and
[1:32:58] we can't give up just still right other
[1:33:00] alter that and keep confessing it to God
[1:33:02] and keep surrounding our house to him
[1:33:10] praise the Lord
[1:33:16] you
[1:33:20] he also said this in the v
[1:33:23] identification of a truth church who is
[1:33:25] the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:33:27] dead in all things that he might have
[1:33:30] the preeminence who is the head of the
[1:33:32] church Jesus Christ what key Demaryius
[1:33:36] is a Masonic Edom the church not an
[1:33:38] organization the church a mystical body
[1:33:40] to which Christ is the head all I love
[1:33:44] that walking in the spirit obeying the
[1:33:47] king foolish to the word precious in the
[1:33:51] sight of God
[1:33:53] walking in the spirit missed on us to
[1:33:55] laugh at all that live godly in Christ
[1:33:59] Jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:34:02] praise the Lord amen now when we go back
[1:34:07] to Christ as the mystery of God reveal
[1:34:09] we read that a few weeks ago word you
[1:34:14] know Bourbon talks about how God wrote
[1:34:17] his word in the lives of his prophets in
[1:34:23] the life of men and women that he have
[1:34:28] chosen in the ages gone by he wrote his
[1:34:31] word in their lives
[1:34:32] praise the Lord one time he wrote his
[1:34:36] word in the heavens job and the rest of
[1:34:41] them could look in the heavens that is
[1:34:43] the reason why job is the book they have
[1:34:46] one of the beautiful picture of creation
[1:34:49] than any other book in the Bible
[1:34:52] praise the Lord amen it talks about it
[1:34:58] talks about the heavens in a way that I
[1:35:02] mean they're just they're just no
[1:35:03] prophet in the Bible where ever talks
[1:35:05] about the heavens because the thing
[1:35:07] about it is that the Zofia was their
[1:35:10] Bible they look in the heavens praise
[1:35:14] the Lord amen
[1:35:16] when clouds are gathering it's so easy
[1:35:19] for them to see a man on a cherub it's a
[1:35:23] can you see it I just see clouds
[1:35:27] praise the Lord a mean and I mean
[1:35:32] as a season change those men were
[1:35:36] reading the heavens so when God gave His
[1:35:41] Word over to his prophets the prophets
[1:35:43] brought the Word of God to the people
[1:35:45] now said the Lord and and you know the
[1:35:49] spoke in the name of the Lord and and an
[1:35:51] instructor people in the name of the
[1:35:53] Lord and different things today but yet
[1:35:56] instead God used the oppression of life
[1:35:59] I mean he used the oppression of life
[1:36:04] and things that they were going to be on
[1:36:07] what the prophesied beyond what the
[1:36:10] spoke in the name of the Lord God used
[1:36:13] the oppression of life and in your
[1:36:16] personal life there was a hidden wisdom
[1:36:19] of God praise the Lord now I mean this
[1:36:25] times giving message from brother
[1:36:27] Branham talks about the bride
[1:36:28] he talks about her as their elected Lady
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:33] he talks about her as us as the election
[1:36:37] lady she was a special woman amen
[1:36:40] the bride of Jesus Christ she is praise
[1:36:44] the Lord
[1:36:45] now so for the type of this of this
[1:36:48] bride I would take a woman that God
[1:36:52] wrote something in her life and that
[1:36:59] would be over in the book of Esther
[1:37:02] praise the Lord we all know the book of
[1:37:06] Esther and we know the story of Esther
[1:37:09] praise the Lord the Jewish people love
[1:37:12] the story of Esther because it was one
[1:37:16] of the time in the history were the gain
[1:37:19] a tremendous victory over one that was
[1:37:23] plotting to terminate him amen the
[1:37:27] Jewish people have suffered the threat
[1:37:29] of being terminated for for for ages so
[1:37:35] the law of this book of Esther praise
[1:37:37] the Lord Amen but just like we are
[1:37:42] saying God use people throughout the
[1:37:44] scripture
[1:37:47] like you look up you look at the book of
[1:37:50] Esther you realize yet as you read
[1:37:53] through the through the through the
[1:37:55] entire book there was net it's not a
[1:37:57] verse in that book that somehow brings
[1:38:02] out brings out innocence or the word God
[1:38:07] is never used in the book that's one one
[1:38:09] thing for the fact you know it's never
[1:38:13] used in the book and it just looks like
[1:38:19] it was just
[1:38:21] either all about this woman Esther and
[1:38:24] her uncle mother kind but reminding you
[1:38:28] again God in the edges he choose people
[1:38:33] amen and that is the reason why he
[1:38:37] wanted people in this age that he can
[1:38:41] have a preeminence in their life why
[1:38:45] because once again God is having people
[1:38:48] that are written episode praise the Lord
[1:38:53] people that are written I mean a working
[1:38:57] Bible amen and you see the age the age
[1:39:04] is is getting more evil and getting more
[1:39:08] weak
[1:39:09] I mean wicked and people hearts is going
[1:39:11] away from the Lord I mean I mean just
[1:39:13] also some things they are doing in this
[1:39:16] age once again the god of this evil age
[1:39:22] has gained his sense of victory in our
[1:39:30] Supreme Court when once again this
[1:39:34] nation they have had their first inset
[1:39:37] marriage abroad marrying the sister and
[1:39:41] then in the nation and the age the age
[1:39:45] in general is growing I mean there there
[1:39:48] are things that are going to happen
[1:39:49] things are going to happen and that's
[1:39:53] the reason why God is looking for the
[1:39:55] people a people that was completely
[1:39:58] so rather themselves to hear praise the
[1:40:03] Lord
[1:40:03] when Shadrach Meshach and Abednego was
[1:40:06] down there in Babylon there was they
[1:40:08] were just there was no other Church
[1:40:10] there was no other religion Babylon was
[1:40:13] just an adulterous evil nation praise
[1:40:18] the Lord Amen when children Misha and
[1:40:22] Abednego was down there in Babylon and
[1:40:28] Babylon at that time was the superpower
[1:40:31] of the world
[1:40:33] Babylon was just like the United States
[1:40:36] superpower great nation in the world
[1:40:39] every nation around the world feared him
[1:40:41] and when the King speaks praise the Lord
[1:40:49] but there was a little group of people
[1:40:54] there was a men that was determined not
[1:40:59] to defy themselves a little group of
[1:41:04] people and you know the problem there
[1:41:07] Shadrach Meshach Abednego heart they
[1:41:09] never had problem with the Babylonians
[1:41:11] because the Babylonians knew that they
[1:41:13] were worshippers of Jehovah
[1:41:15] they higher problem with backsliding
[1:41:17] Jews back sledding Jews amen they were
[1:41:22] not ready to stand for the Word of God
[1:41:23] that were ready to compromise with
[1:41:25] everything that was where they had
[1:41:29] problem their problem was with those box
[1:41:37] lady Jews praise the Lord that would
[1:41:43] tell them you know that the the Temple
[1:41:45] of Solomon is now here we don't have no
[1:41:49] priests to make sacrifices what is the
[1:41:52] need of worshiping Jehovah
[1:41:54] there is no preacher to make sacrifices
[1:41:57] we don't have we don't have the Temple
[1:41:59] of Solomon yet to go and pray let's just
[1:42:01] follow them
[1:42:07] praise Lord oh but there was a Daniel
[1:42:10] that prayed three times a day even
[1:42:14] against the Kings come I mean praise the
[1:42:17] Lord
[1:42:18] he didn't look for the secret place he
[1:42:20] opened his window and he make his voice
[1:42:25] to be heard
[1:42:26] praise the Lord now you see it was not
[1:42:30] God impressing himself on those people
[1:42:33] it was those people determined to give
[1:42:36] God the preeminence generally they were

[1:47:53] have and I don't know what a woman need
[1:47:55] to be mentioning this praise the Lord
[1:47:58] and God saw that there those those those
[1:48:03] young people were determined to give him
[1:48:08] the preeminence that he will make
[1:48:10] himself known as God when you give God
[1:48:13] the first place God will surely take the
[1:48:15] first place and he will show himself
[1:48:19] above everything and he came down in the
[1:48:22] midst of the fire you know the story
[1:48:24] praise the Lord Amen I believe if I you
[1:48:39] know the King dear belchy shares are
[1:48:44] whichever one of them was the enabling
[1:48:46] NASA whichever one you know called

[1:49:08] the king and says well you know king

[1:49:17] think it's my god that i want to be
[1:49:19] worshiping man it's my god that i want
[1:49:23] to be glorified not me now man ability
[1:49:26] praise the Lord
[1:49:28] trying to push the thought of
[1:49:30] preeminence here so you be able to see
[1:49:32] it
[1:49:32] Amen that's that's what God that's what
[1:49:36] God desire from the people that we just
[1:49:41] so rather give him the first place
[1:49:58] let's go to the book of Esther a little
[1:50:00] bit here I could take all the time here
[1:50:19] Oh glory be to God amen
[1:50:28] now the book of Esther year has a very
[1:50:32] beautiful picture that I want for us to
[1:50:35] just read together and instead it a
[1:50:37] little bit year now the the book of
[1:50:47] Esther open open up wafer they came
[1:50:51] desiring Vashti his wife to come praise
[1:50:56] the Lord and and the scripture says that
[1:51:02] shows that she refused to come to the
[1:51:05] king's bidding are we to get him amen we
[1:51:13] have to realize that is you know it was
[1:51:15] it was customary those days were in
[1:51:19] royal polish the king has the King
[1:51:22] chamber were were heed words and he take
[1:51:25] care of everything that he has to take
[1:51:27] care of and and and the Queen is also in
[1:51:31] the same Palace but she also over in
[1:51:33] another chamber and you know she take
[1:51:35] care of things that she has to take care
[1:51:37] of and and there was a time where the
[1:51:39] King will desire his wife to come amen
[1:51:43] now you have to keep in your mind what
[1:51:45] we're dealing with here is preeminence
[1:51:47] Christ and his bride amen
[1:51:50] that's what we're dealing with so as as
[1:52:00] Vashti this you know Queen refused to
[1:52:05] comes to the king's command right there
[1:52:10] it was she was destroying you know the
[1:52:16] image of the ones that they ruled over
[1:52:20] the nation I mean she was showing the
[1:52:27] you know destroying reference to the
[1:52:30] king
[1:52:32] praise the Lord Amen so because of their
[1:52:38] the King councillors who advised him
[1:52:42] that she thought the soup would wash it
[1:52:45] away
[1:52:45] you know the shapour away this is a
[1:52:47] disgrace
[1:52:48] you know she being the quaint that the
[1:52:51] quaint when the King request of her she
[1:52:57] should come so meeting herself because
[1:52:59] that's the way she is going to influence
[1:53:02] the rest of the lady you have read the
[1:53:04] scripture before and you know exactly
[1:53:06] what it is he meant now so we see in
[1:53:09] them that because of their the Queen
[1:53:12] that the king is now going to make a
[1:53:14] request to have to have a new wife he's
[1:53:19] going to make a request now you know all
[1:53:23] the young version in the in the province
[1:53:26] the young virgin in the kingdom to come
[1:53:28] and present themselves praise the Lord
[1:53:30] hallelujah amen and then all the all the
[1:53:36] young virgins you know what went over
[1:53:38] you know and and the king will give them
[1:53:40] somebody do you know that would be the a
[1:53:42] caretaker that will be their you know
[1:53:44] their custodian to take care of them and
[1:53:46] get them ready and all of that as we
[1:53:49] look through the scripture year now you
[1:53:52] see God year this kind of for writing
[1:53:55] out something and and and and in all
[1:53:58] through the ages you know like I said
[1:54:01] the Jewish people love this and people
[1:54:03] will read the story about Esther but you
[1:54:06] see there there are something of God's
[1:54:08] divine wisdom that I hear right in the
[1:54:11] pages of the book I've tried to try and
[1:54:14] just trust that along with just help us
[1:54:16] now as we will you know try to bring
[1:54:19] this out and then right there we see
[1:54:20] that this young Jewish woman now Esther
[1:54:26] she was under the guidance of her uncle
[1:54:28] Mordecai T man and he and he heard that
[1:54:32] now remember now you just remember this
[1:54:35] was after the Lord of Moses and a lot of
[1:54:38] Moses also required that there should be
[1:54:43] no Jew
[1:54:45] be able to give his daughter to a
[1:54:47] Gentile man Amen or gave his son over to
[1:54:51] a Gentile woman and now they're in the
[1:54:55] Ghent I kiddin amen and here is a
[1:54:57] request of a gent I king praise the Lord
[1:55:02] amen are you seen the hidden wisdom of
[1:55:07] God praise the Lord
[1:55:09] something that that the maja bloke
[1:55:12] contrary to God's Word but yet is going
[1:55:15] to run right down the peph a will of God
[1:55:19] because his hidden wisdom is in it are
[1:55:25] we together and Molokai called his his
[1:55:30] little nation and said to her well did
[1:55:34] you hear that the King needed young
[1:55:36] women to go down oh yeah I heard about
[1:55:38] it but you know Papa maybe she could
[1:55:42] call him Papa because he was just like a
[1:55:45] dad to to her I'm a dude
[1:55:49] amen then he's trying to talk to her and
[1:55:53] and let her know that oh he's honoring
[1:55:58] his guidance and he will allow her to go
[1:56:01] and we know the story how she went
[1:56:05] through and as she came over to the
[1:56:10] king's chamber
[1:56:12] even the custodian that was given to her
[1:56:15] found favor in her side amen praise the
[1:56:18] Lord that I want I want to bring us over
[1:56:22] to chapter 2 here let's look to chapter
[1:56:26] 2 a little bit here there was something
[1:56:31] I was telling last night I was so
[1:56:32] beautiful
[1:56:43] now there were many other women many
[1:56:46] other young ladies that there came to
[1:56:52] the king
[1:56:53] praise the Lord many other young virgin
[1:56:58] that came to the king and wore them
[1:57:06] preeminence he had a little baby and the
[1:57:10] scripture says from verse 3 then let the
[1:57:19] King appoint officers in all the
[1:57:21] provinces and the kingdom that they may
[1:57:23] gather together all the fair young
[1:57:25] virgins in Shushan
[1:57:26] the polish told the house of the women
[1:57:30] and in the custody of Haggadah
[1:57:34] the Kings Chamberlain keepers of the
[1:57:37] women and let and let their thing thing
[1:57:40] for purification be given to them
[1:57:42] praise the Lord amen
[1:58:02] okay let's drop them down to verse verse
[1:58:06] 12 now when every meeting term was come
[1:58:16] to go in to King has a serous after that
[1:58:22] she had been 12 months according to the
[1:58:26] model of the women for so were the days
[1:58:30] of their purification accomplished wait
[1:58:33] six months with or of mirth and six
[1:58:37] months with sweet altar and wave other
[1:58:40] things for the for the purifying of the
[1:58:43] woman then dust came every meeting unto
[1:58:48] the king whatsoever she desire was given
[1:58:52] to her to go go with her out of the
[1:58:55] house of the women on to the king's
[1:58:58] chamber in the evening she went praise
[1:59:04] the Lord
[1:59:05] now you have to know that if you bring
[1:59:07] this over to the church ages the
[1:59:10] messenger of every age comes in the
[1:59:12] evening time amen and as the messenger
[1:59:17] of the age he takes the people of their
[1:59:20] age to the Lord in the evening time amen
[1:59:25] it keeps it keeps the the order of
[1:59:28] creation from the evening to the morning
[1:59:31] was the first day from the evening to
[1:59:34] the morning was the second thing
[1:59:37] amen so it starts in the evening time
[1:59:41] now this young medium was taking after
[1:59:43] her purification and everything she was
[1:59:47] taking over to the king's chamber in the
[1:59:49] evening time now you watch how the
[1:59:53] scripture what makes it a little bit
[1:59:55] beautiful year for us in a evening she
[1:59:58] went and on the morning she returned
[2:00:02] into the second house of the women told
[2:00:06] the custody of shochet gasps the Kings
[2:00:11] Chamberlain which kept that which kept
[2:00:15] the concubines
[2:00:16] praise the Lord she came in on to the
[2:00:21] king normal except the king delighted in
[2:00:26] her and that she were called by name
[2:00:31] praise the Lord
[2:00:33] now I was looking into in today's last
[2:00:38] night what I said I was telling you last
[2:00:40] night was I was telling you see all
[2:00:42] through the scripture David hi
[2:00:45] concubines and and and and and and
[2:00:51] Solomon have concubines in and that word
[2:00:54] is used over in the scripture as I was
[2:00:57] studying this and trying to apply a tool
[2:01:00] to the church and trying to apply it to
[2:01:03] what God they throughout the ages of
[2:01:06] reformation even down to our age I went
[2:01:09] back I started studying a little bit
[2:01:11] like a poor brought a little bit of
[2:01:14] death over in Romans chapter seven
[2:01:17] worried about the way he brought it was
[2:01:19] he spoke on the sense of between the
[2:01:23] wife and the virgin where he was going
[2:01:25] to talk about you know if a woman
[2:01:28] married a man and I don't believe in and
[2:01:31] she want to serve the Lord and you know
[2:01:32] there's nothing that stopper and out of
[2:01:34] that he went into death but then I was
[2:01:36] trying to look how what was the
[2:01:38] difference between the concubines and
[2:01:41] the wives praise the Lord because it was
[2:01:46] a culture that was held all through the
[2:01:49] ages now so as as you studied in as you
[2:01:53] even see right here in the scripture the
[2:01:56] Bible says that this young women would
[2:01:58] come into the King in the evening time
[2:02:01] and on the morning he was given over to
[2:02:05] talk to one of the caretakers and she
[2:02:08] would take her right down to the to the
[2:02:10] other house the second house and their
[2:02:13] house was the house of the king's
[2:02:17] concubines and she came normal
[2:02:21] she came normal to the king until when
[2:02:28] he thinks about her once in
[2:02:29] the wine and he sent for her
[2:02:33] it just is just he thinks about how she
[2:02:37] comes and and she well she goes back
[2:02:39] into that you see God in a way that he
[2:02:43] works through the church ages it was
[2:02:47] almost the same thing when on the days
[2:02:50] of pentecost you know and then after the
[2:02:52] first church was born and and the the
[2:02:56] jewish church that went in the influence
[2:02:58] the birth of the gentile church in Acts
[2:03:00] chapter 10 and then we realized and the
[2:03:04] church age went from the first church
[2:03:06] age to the second church age and then to
[2:03:09] the Terr church age it got down into a
[2:03:11] dark period praise the law and after
[2:03:14] that that period God started raising man
[2:03:17] of there were reformers great men that
[2:03:20] were also blessed to be able to revive
[2:03:22] the people like Luther Wesley and all of
[2:03:25] those people but you see after every
[2:03:27] church had an experience with God the
[2:03:31] messenger would come on the scene and he
[2:03:34] would brings the people there will be a
[2:03:35] move of God amen
[2:03:37] something that will move the people just
[2:03:40] like Luther putting those theses on the
[2:03:42] church and then I mean calling out the
[2:03:46] things that the Catholic Church was
[2:03:47] doing trying to bring the people back to
[2:03:50] the Bible praise the Lord and God will
[2:03:53] bring every vibra among the people
[2:03:55] praise the Lord it was a true revival it
[2:04:00] was a move of God among the people
[2:04:03] praise the Lord but after a little why
[2:04:07] the people will go right back into the
[2:04:12] things that they were doing before they
[2:04:15] will go right back to that all Catholic
[2:04:17] teachings and doctrines so what happened
[2:04:20] in that type like we see right here in
[2:04:23] the book of Esther the church is put in
[2:04:26] the house of the concubine once in a way
[2:04:31] that will have a revival because God
[2:04:36] move with them
[2:04:41] praise the Lord and the scripture was
[2:04:46] speaks then the next evening another
[2:04:50] young woman will be brought over to the
[2:04:52] king until the morning he was send her
[2:04:57] over to the second house praise the Lord
[2:05:02] I love when the scripture plays this
[2:05:07] thing out verse 15 now when the turn of
[2:05:12] Esther the doubt sort of I beheld the
[2:05:16] uncle of mother Kai who have taken her
[2:05:19] for his daughter was come to go in unto
[2:05:22] the king she requested nothing but what
[2:05:26] had got the King's Chamber Chamberlain
[2:05:30] the keeper of the women appointed and
[2:05:34] Esther our team favor in the sight of
[2:05:38] all them that look upon her praise the
[2:05:42] Lord
[2:05:42] so when Esther was sticking onto King
[2:05:47] has Osiris into his house Roya in the
[2:05:52] tenth month which is the month of Tibet
[2:05:57] in the seven year of his reign amen
[2:06:01] remember years back when I used to
[2:06:03] preach this I always preached 10-7 amen
[2:06:06] then I gave the young people running all
[2:06:08] over the place and the King loved Esther
[2:06:14] above all the women and she attained
[2:06:18] Grace praise the Lord Amen she attained
[2:06:24] grace are we together and favor now that
[2:06:32] was the only thing that was special
[2:06:35] it was Ned it was near her physical
[2:06:39] appearance she attained grace amen
[2:06:46] she attained Grace and favor in the
[2:06:51] sight in his side more than
[2:06:54] all the virgins so that he said the
[2:07:02] royal crown upon her head and made her
[2:07:05] Queen instead of Vashti and the King
[2:07:08] made a great feast now when you go back
[2:07:13] and you see that is the thing that's
[2:07:16] separated the wife from the virgins the
[2:07:20] Jews call it the removing of the veil
[2:07:25] amen praise the Lord all of the Jewish
[2:07:30] law dear tradition is that a man can
[2:07:34] love a woman and take the woman to his
[2:07:37] house or take the woman to him as a wife
[2:07:39] but when there was never the removing of
[2:07:43] the veil she was never considered a wife
[2:07:50] now for for them to remove the veil they
[2:07:55] have to follow all the Moorish Paulinus
[2:08:00] praise the Lord
[2:08:01] like I said like I said to you here
[2:08:04] before marriage in the scripture has
[2:08:06] never been a secret thing right from the
[2:08:10] beginning everything is brought right
[2:08:14] before the elders of the city everybody
[2:08:17] knows about it
[2:08:18] praise the Lord Amen you know and and
[2:08:23] and and the devil has a way of working
[2:08:26] and his way of working is always to
[2:08:30] isolate people amen if he can get you
[2:08:35] into isolation and think that you are
[2:08:38] doing something in secret I'm doing a
[2:08:42] secret thing and when I bring Allah
[2:08:44] everybody will be surprised praise the
[2:08:47] Lord that is his way of working glory be
[2:08:51] to God I was talking to one young woman
[2:08:54] and I taught I say sir you know we
[2:08:57] talked a little bit and I just told I
[2:08:59] says well you know well if you look
[2:09:02] through the scripture that's what the
[2:09:04] Bible says there
[2:09:07] nothing secret about this praise the
[2:09:10] Lord Amen if you fulfilled if you
[2:09:15] fulfill the right because before they
[2:09:22] come down to that fish that called the
[2:09:24] removing of the veil all the rights you
[2:09:27] know you know your your parents and
[2:09:30] everything that has to get involved in
