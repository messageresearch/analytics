[40:34] foreign
[40:46] [Music]
[40:53] [Applause]
[40:55] [Music]
[40:57] just for a moment
[41:02] praise be to God
[41:07] God bless you all Saints
[41:10] and um happy to see every one of you
[41:16] um it's been a very cold blastering
[41:18] winter morning
[41:20] and um I honestly was not expecting
[41:24] to see many of us this morning
[41:28] but praise be to God
[41:30] God bless you all for coming
[41:33] and I urge you to be in great
[41:35] expectation
[41:36] because I was talking to brother jarrow
[41:40] when I picked him up from the airport
[41:41] that night
[41:43] actually they canceled
[41:45] um don't take my word for it but I
[41:47] believe I saw 5
[41:50] 000 flights
[41:52] and um that day we were expecting two
[41:55] people uh one from New Jersey and of
[41:59] course brother jarrow and then the one
[42:03] from New Jersey called and said the
[42:04] flight is canceled
[42:06] so we were just wondering what was going
[42:09] to happen
[42:10] so when brother jaro came in and were
[42:12] talking
[42:13] you know when he got to he had to rebook
[42:16] his flight
[42:19] um when they got to New Hampshire I
[42:21] believe it was uh he said he was the
[42:24] last person to enter the plane
[42:28] and when he entered then they took off
[42:31] and I believe
[42:34] that he is here on a Divine Mission
[42:38] he is here on a Divine course
[42:42] things like this don't just happen just
[42:45] for the fun of it
[42:47] I mean everything that happened the
[42:50] easiest thing that could have happened
[42:53] for us to receive a call oh the flight
[42:56] is canceled and we would all understand
[42:59] but praise be to God he made a way for
[43:02] his servant and it's for a good cause
[43:06] just open your hearts and ready
[43:10] to receive from the Lord
[43:12] it's not a man
[43:15] a lot of the times we come expecting to
[43:18] hear from the man
[43:19] and it is the reason a lot of the times
[43:21] we get offended because even when God is
[43:25] talking to you you just hear the voice
[43:27] of a man and you get offended
[43:30] but when you walk in here knowing in
[43:32] your heart that you are coming to hear
[43:34] from God it doesn't matter what comes
[43:36] from the man's mouth you just hear
[43:39] nothing by the voice of God
[43:42] praise be to God
[43:45] Merry Christmas to everyone of you
[43:49] and it's just amazing how how
[43:53] how early
[43:55] not how Elevate All Too Soon the year
[43:57] has come to an end
[44:00] I tell people at work that in Africa
[44:03] where I come from we have 24 months in a
[44:06] year
[44:08] but here in America we have six months
[44:11] in a year
[44:14] and I was saying it
[44:16] and uh my manager told me that you know
[44:18] what I heard that also from somebody a
[44:21] Chinese
[44:22] and the Chinese lady said actually they
[44:25] have four months in China
[44:27] in a year
[44:29] because she said she was a banker and
[44:31] when you spend more than one minute on a
[44:34] I don't know how true it is if you spend
[44:36] more than one minute on a customer
[44:39] if you're not lucky to fire you
[44:41] 30 seconds you are done 30 seconds you
[44:45] are done that is how fast
[44:49] we are running
[44:53] life is in the first Lane
[44:57] and before you are where the year has
[44:59] come to an end and things you plan to do
[45:02] you never did them
[45:04] and that is how the devil steals our
[45:07] attention
[45:08] and before you away you are even 60
[45:11] years and you don't know how you got
[45:12] there
[45:14] praise the Lord
[45:17] and things you should have done
[45:18] yesterday are still staring at you in
[45:20] the face
[45:22] we have gotten so close to the end
[45:25] never lose sight of it
[45:29] 2022
[45:31] very soon would be history it will never
[45:35] come again
[45:37] it tells you how close we are to the end
[45:40] God has sent his servant here for a
[45:42] cause this morning
[45:44] I don't know what he has on his
[45:46] on it but certainly
[45:49] certainly there is something for every
[45:52] one of us here this morning
[45:54] and just receive from the Lord praise be
[45:58] to God
[45:59] shall we just stand on our feet
[46:04] just say a word of Prayer
[46:06] and we can get him in
[46:09] I have two prayer requests here before I
[46:12] forget
[46:13] one from sis Bria
[46:16] there is a brother in Kenya by the name
[46:19] brother Isaac
[46:21] whose brother had an accident and is
[46:24] currently in the hospital
[46:27] and also
[46:29] a prayer request from brother Ben
[46:33] uh for sis his sister-in-law
[46:38] who is also admitted to the hospital and
[46:41] currently undergoing some tests
[46:45] praise be to God
[46:47] shall we burden our heads as we go
[46:50] before the Lord

[47:14] us before the intern of Grace

[1:03:53] we are kind of unofficial today so we'll
[1:03:56] put up with one another amen and look
[1:03:59] like the the weather has worked on us so
[1:04:02] don't worry because we are not uh we are
[1:04:05] not going for some convention in the
[1:04:09] white house so we don't have to be
[1:04:12] formal or do things so superficial so
[1:04:15] they can be put in the mic while we are
[1:04:16] sitting down just don't worry about it
[1:04:18] let that be my trouble amen
[1:04:21] when I was coming out I I thought of it
[1:04:24] I said okay everything has changed now
[1:04:26] bro Steve I said well I have to depend
[1:04:28] on this mic so I will just have to stand
[1:04:29] in one place
[1:04:31] and I thought that was going to be the
[1:04:32] case but unfortunately uh it changed
[1:04:36] I've been doctored upon now amen we're
[1:04:39] going to find out how this all works
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:41] so we are thankful to be in the house of
[1:04:44] God this morning
[1:04:45] my prayer is that God we
[1:04:49] we really visit us
[1:04:52] that's my prayer this morning that God
[1:04:55] visit each and every one of us if for
[1:04:59] nothing the the bad Road and the the
[1:05:03] white Christmas like people pray for now
[1:05:06] they have it and everybody's in their
[1:05:07] house
[1:05:09] amen so
[1:05:11] if for nothing that God will will meet
[1:05:15] with us that's my prayer
[1:05:17] when brother one called me about two
[1:05:20] three weeks ago and he said I want you
[1:05:22] to come to Minnesota
[1:05:25] for the Christmas period
[1:05:28] I said I said okay I didn't think I
[1:05:31] didn't even think it I said okay
[1:05:34] and then after I have said that
[1:05:37] I started thinking of it my cousin in
[1:05:39] Indonesia called and said he was coming
[1:05:41] with his wife and his two kids and I've
[1:05:44] not seen him since 2012.
[1:05:47] and I said now things are beginning to
[1:05:50] fall in place in the way I don't want
[1:05:53] them
[1:05:54] so after the service my my pastor told
[1:05:58] me said I want you to speak on Sunday
[1:06:00] and on Christmas period I said well but
[1:06:03] I want already told me to come down
[1:06:05] there Christmas period so I'm not going
[1:06:07] to be around during that Christmas
[1:06:09] period I gave him my word
[1:06:11] but I will be in service on that's the
[1:06:13] last Sunday
[1:06:15] and everything started unfolding in a
[1:06:18] different way last Sunday because my
[1:06:21] cousin told me he was coming and he sent
[1:06:22] me his flight itinerary in my mind it
[1:06:25] was coming on
[1:06:26] Saturday we're on the 17th
[1:06:28] but in reality he was coming on the 18th
[1:06:31] you know at times he could be living in
[1:06:32] your mind this world is not in your mind
[1:06:34] there's reality and there's your mind
[1:06:36] you know so in my mind it was coming on
[1:06:38] the 17th but in reality it was coming on
[1:06:40] the 18th so I was working with my mind
[1:06:43] not reality because I didn't have time
[1:06:45] to look at the itinerary to see that it
[1:06:47] will be arriving 8 am on Sunday and by 8
[1:06:50] am I should be preparing to go to church
[1:06:52] and I've given the past of my words I'll
[1:06:54] be in church and I'll speak
[1:06:56] and so on Friday I called him up I said
[1:06:59] uh okay uh how are things going this
[1:07:01] everything is doing or going all right
[1:07:03] we're going to be flying we'll be in
[1:07:05] Dubai and then we'll call you
[1:07:07] and then say we'll be arriving on Sunday
[1:07:09] I said maybe I didn't hear what he said
[1:07:10] clearly I said what did he say we'll be
[1:07:12] arriving on Sunday I say yes yes Sunday
[1:07:14] and then I thought of it what did they
[1:07:16] just say Sunday and then I looked at the
[1:07:18] itinerary he says it's only 8 am in the
[1:07:20] morning and then the Mind battle began
[1:07:23] and I'm worried I said I've not seen
[1:07:25] this person for 12 since 2012. now he's
[1:07:28] coming to the United States with his
[1:07:30] family
[1:07:31] uh
[1:07:32] and they're going to be at the airport
[1:07:33] by 8 AM and it's impossible for my house
[1:07:37] to they flew into a different airport
[1:07:39] Dulles in DC I'm gonna have to drive
[1:07:41] three to four hours to go pick them up
[1:07:44] I see there is no way under the heavens
[1:07:46] for me
[1:07:48] to drive from DC even if I have to drive
[1:07:50] on Saturday night
[1:07:52] and pick them up to drive from DC and
[1:07:54] drive to church it's gonna be all messed
[1:07:57] up
[1:07:58] I'm not going to really be organized to
[1:08:00] be inappropriate so I said okay and
[1:08:03] suggestion begin to come to my mind I
[1:08:05] said just call the pastor and tell him
[1:08:06] you're not going to be able to speak and
[1:08:08] you should get some other person and and
[1:08:10] and things will just go all right and
[1:08:13] you can just go and pick them up
[1:08:15] then I thought of that I said okay uh
[1:08:18] that was kind of almost leaning towards
[1:08:20] that angle because I believe coming to
[1:08:22] the presence of God we have to really
[1:08:24] prepare to get out of the way so God can
[1:08:26] speak to people so in all reality we're
[1:08:29] actually Servants of God we're like
[1:08:31] tools in the box at the the mechanic it
[1:08:34] just picks out the two that he needs and
[1:08:36] used to work on the car that's actually
[1:08:38] where we are so when we come into God's
[1:08:40] presence when we come in here the
[1:08:42] struggle is to get out of the way so God
[1:08:44] can reach the people the subway is not
[1:08:46] the clothes you put on or the kind of
[1:08:48] English word you're gonna all those
[1:08:49] things doesn't really matter you could
[1:08:50] even fall dead on the platform and they
[1:08:52] pick you and you go go just like that
[1:08:54] I'm going to come to something on that
[1:08:56] that line and so I was thinking of that
[1:08:58] I said okay the best thing I'll just do
[1:09:00] my wife and my mom can be driving to
[1:09:02] church why I'll just drive to the
[1:09:03] airport and pick them up that thought
[1:09:05] begin to to come and then there was like
[1:09:08] a battle I said this is kind of
[1:09:10] sacrilegious you know how can I just
[1:09:13] just dump the service and then be going
[1:09:16] to the airport and now I'm thinking how
[1:09:18] can I just let them arrive at the
[1:09:19] airport and be going to church now I'm
[1:09:21] in between both
[1:09:23] and I told my wife I said uh well now we
[1:09:26] have a situation here
[1:09:27] I said to go and pick these people I
[1:09:30] said well I'm just going to drive there
[1:09:31] I said I don't trust you on the steering
[1:09:33] wheel to go because if she has to go she
[1:09:35] has to leave the home like about 3 A.M
[1:09:37] in the morning I said I don't trust you
[1:09:39] to that point she said I've driven I
[1:09:42] said no I just don't I just want my
[1:09:44] heart to be at peace knowing that they
[1:09:46] are around that I don't trust you
[1:09:47] driving 3am in the morning and be
[1:09:49] heading towards DC I don't trust that he
[1:09:52] said so what are we going to do I said
[1:09:53] we're going to pray God will give a
[1:09:54] solution and I'm praying and this battle
[1:09:57] is still going on in my mind I said I
[1:09:59] said this is really the devil and then
[1:10:01] somebody came again and said there's a
[1:10:02] minister that I usually visit us in the
[1:10:04] church somebody say just go to church
[1:10:06] and tell the pastor that Buddha should
[1:10:08] speak for you and then you can just
[1:10:09] drive to DC I said well that sounds like
[1:10:12] a good idea
[1:10:13] and uh to be candid that brother was in
[1:10:16] church that day
[1:10:18] see the way everything works out at
[1:10:20] times he came to church that day so
[1:10:21] it'll just be easy for me to say
[1:10:23] important Edwards can you speak the
[1:10:25] passenger can you speak I'm running to
[1:10:27] the airport and everything would have
[1:10:28] just been all right in my own mind not
[1:10:31] in the real world like I told you
[1:10:32] there's a real world and there's your
[1:10:33] mind so you don't want to live in your
[1:10:35] mind because in your mind you are the
[1:10:37] one that is doing everything right every
[1:10:39] other person is wrong in fact bro Steve
[1:10:41] is a hypocrite bro ability hypocrite
[1:10:44] everybody you are the right brother you
[1:10:46] are do you are perfect when you sang
[1:10:48] that special that's how God wanted it
[1:10:50] twin sister Kelly sang it she didn't use
[1:10:52] the right tone so Angels didn't clap for
[1:10:54] her so but you in your world everything
[1:10:56] is just Prophet that that's how there's
[1:10:58] something that didn't sing it well I
[1:10:59] mean if you are stood on the piano you
[1:11:01] would have shown brother area that this
[1:11:03] is how God wanted it or if you've been
[1:11:05] an usher it would have been everybody
[1:11:06] would have seen that God has given this
[1:11:08] church and Usher we've been playing
[1:11:10] since with the ocean we have but God has
[1:11:12] good that's in your mind but in the real
[1:11:14] world things are really different so it
[1:11:16] will be good most of the time if you can
[1:11:17] leave our mind and come to the real
[1:11:20] world because it's a real world and
[1:11:22] there's your mind
[1:11:23] and the world does not evolve in your
[1:11:25] mind there is no Galaxy in your mind
[1:11:27] it's just blood and veins and artery
[1:11:29] that's what exists in your in your heart
[1:11:31] there so nothing there so we want to
[1:11:33] come out of your mind and actually come
[1:11:34] to the real world
[1:11:36] in the real world everybody is not the
[1:11:38] saint
[1:11:40] even the Saints also make mistake that
[1:11:42] we will almost say they are not sent
[1:11:45] that's in the real world but in your
[1:11:47] mind yeah you're working on coals of
[1:11:49] fire you're mashing the devil's head and
[1:11:51] everything is just going smooth and when
[1:11:53] you pray God answer and when you when
[1:11:55] you lay hard it is your prayer always
[1:11:57] when they prayed and that brother and
[1:11:59] care that had an accident when God
[1:12:01] healed him it was your prayer godhead
[1:12:03] not when because God knew you were
[1:12:05] holding all night yesterday so God know
[1:12:08] you'll be building up you'll be doing
[1:12:09] some spiritual uh lift you've been in
[1:12:11] the gym spiritually you know what I'm
[1:12:13] saying and so when you prayed everybody
[1:12:15] was praying but when you just say oh
[1:12:16] Lord answer that prayer God just healed
[1:12:18] the brother so when there's a testimony
[1:12:20] tomorrow about the brother being healed
[1:12:22] it was your prayer you know and you have
[1:12:24] to come and testify that how you prayed
[1:12:26] and when you fed that energy you know
[1:12:28] the the spirit of God came on you and
[1:12:30] you pray that all those happen in your
[1:12:33] mind but you have to come out of your
[1:12:34] mind there's a real world yes in their
[1:12:36] real world none of that happened if God
[1:12:39] does anything it will be his mercy and
[1:12:41] his grace
[1:12:42] it's not going to be according to your
[1:12:44] mind it's going to be according to his
[1:12:46] mercy and his grace
[1:12:49] and so while all of that was going on
[1:12:51] and and I'm thinking of that I just it's
[1:12:54] just beginning to get me really worried
[1:12:56] and then I begin to realize what Steve
[1:12:57] how little things can get you
[1:13:00] disorganized and worried
[1:13:03] and so I got upstairs I'm cleaning the
[1:13:05] vista's room my wife went to work I'm
[1:13:07] preparing the visitors room and I'm
[1:13:08] still worried I'm still not I'm still
[1:13:11] not come to the conclusion what is going
[1:13:12] to happen
[1:13:13] and I'm cleaning the room all morning
[1:13:15] I'm getting really tired and I relaxed a
[1:13:18] little and I prayed I said Lord
[1:13:21] I'm really confused at this point
[1:13:25] see I just want to come just the way I
[1:13:27] am I'm confused at this point I don't
[1:13:29] really know how to approach this thing
[1:13:31] at this point I don't want this person
[1:13:33] to be upset just coming to the United
[1:13:35] States staying at the airport with two
[1:13:37] little kids and the weather the
[1:13:39] temperature has already dropped like you
[1:13:41] know so them coming they're coming from
[1:13:43] a tropical country Indonesia and now
[1:13:45] they're coming to about almost 20 20
[1:13:48] degrees before it dropped below zero so
[1:13:51] I'm kind of thinking I said my mom I
[1:13:53] don't know what my mom is thinking
[1:13:54] because my mom that is that my cousin
[1:13:57] was adopted by my mom that's my mom's
[1:13:58] younger sister before she passed away
[1:14:00] and he started Living with us so he's
[1:14:03] very close to my mom I said how my mom
[1:14:04] feel we are going to church and if she
[1:14:07] knows that they are at the airport so
[1:14:08] all these things are coming in my mind
[1:14:10] and I'm thinking and I said let me just
[1:14:13] keep praying and I just kept praying and
[1:14:15] praying and all of a sudden it just
[1:14:17] clicked on me get them a hotel
[1:14:20] and
[1:14:22] let them go into them when they're
[1:14:24] flying they should take a shuttle go to
[1:14:26] the hotel and stay there when you're
[1:14:28] done preaching you can drive to go pick
[1:14:30] them up and when you click I just felt
[1:14:34] peace and I told my wife I said I think
[1:14:35] I got the solution I think I think the
[1:14:37] Lord just lays something in my heart now
[1:14:39] we're going to get a hotel for them they
[1:14:41] will go to the hotel and you say that
[1:14:44] sounds like a good idea I say yeah
[1:14:45] that's what we're going to do and about
[1:14:48] 3 A.M in the morning I woke up 3 A.M I
[1:14:50] was calling hotels in DC I couldn't get
[1:14:52] out of the front desk so I called and
[1:14:54] booked a hotel finally and I couldn't
[1:14:57] get a hotel for them because they were
[1:15:00] flying at 8 am in the morning you're
[1:15:02] gonna know I'm telling you all these
[1:15:03] stories because it's going to blend to
[1:15:04] why I'm also here we'll try to take a
[1:15:07] trail like what Abraham said the trail
[1:15:09] of the serpents so we're following this
[1:15:11] Trail yeah because Brian said this
[1:15:13] happened at the beginning is the same
[1:15:14] serpent at the end so you got to follow
[1:15:17] his Trail so
[1:15:19] so I got the hotel uh and I was still
[1:15:23] not Resolute in my mind so I called the
[1:15:25] front desk again in the morning at about
[1:15:27] seven a.m I called and they said okay we
[1:15:29] got the room all set and the guy was so
[1:15:32] rude he was I think that was the most uh
[1:15:36] the most terrible customer service I
[1:15:38] ever had and it was like getting rid of
[1:15:40] the get trying to get rid of me like
[1:15:42] like okay okay I said okay okay okay
[1:15:45] okay uh uh we got the room yeah yeah
[1:15:48] yeah we got we got it you need anything
[1:15:50] more I say oh no no we're fine because I
[1:15:52] could feel the negative energy coming
[1:15:53] from him that could just spill into an
[1:15:56] argument and a bad discourse I said okay
[1:15:58] we're done and then I realized that I
[1:16:01] didn't get no confirmation on my my
[1:16:03] phone that the room was booked so I
[1:16:05] called back again I said that what email
[1:16:07] did you use oh I used the right email I
[1:16:09] said I said I just want you to read the
[1:16:11] email that you used because I didn't get
[1:16:12] the text message uh I didn't get no
[1:16:14] confirmation that the room was booked
[1:16:16] and I had to deal with that negative
[1:16:18] energy again and it was just so rough
[1:16:21] I said oh Lord be merciful and when he
[1:16:23] was done he read the email I said the
[1:16:25] email is wrong it's missing one letter
[1:16:27] he said okay okay okay okay and he got a
[1:16:29] letter and he said we don't I said I
[1:16:31] said I said my
[1:16:34] and we got off the phone I said I just
[1:16:36] want to make sure this room is booked
[1:16:39] so I waited for a while I said probably
[1:16:40] in the afternoon this guy should be out
[1:16:42] of the front desk there should be some
[1:16:43] other person there that I can talk to to
[1:16:45] confirm so I called again in the
[1:16:47] afternoon a lady picked up the phone
[1:16:49] that lady was nice and then she said
[1:16:51] yeah the room was booked I said okay
[1:16:54] they're flying in at about eight eight
[1:16:56] a.m in the morning and I don't know how
[1:16:58] long it's going to take them to to get
[1:17:00] off Customs so I want the room to be
[1:17:03] extended because they said if you don't
[1:17:05] show up by 7 A.M the morning is going to
[1:17:07] be no show so I said is there a way you
[1:17:09] can make it like 10 a.m so they can come
[1:17:11] in she said yes they put a note on there
[1:17:13] so that kind of settled my mind and I
[1:17:15] was no more worried about it and I just
[1:17:18] prayed and so I didn't really have time
[1:17:20] to really uh
[1:17:22] uh study uh
[1:17:24] for the service but I prayed for the
[1:17:26] service and and and I realized that most
[1:17:30] of the time what we really need to do is
[1:17:32] to pray for the service we study we
[1:17:35] don't study for service we study we
[1:17:38] study to know more of God we feed
[1:17:40] ourselves on the world but when it comes
[1:17:42] to service we just pray for the service
[1:17:45] because we don't know what God is going
[1:17:47] to say but we keep feeding on the world
[1:17:49] we keep listening to tape reading the
[1:17:50] scripture that's what you do every day
[1:17:52] but when we come into church what the
[1:17:54] subject is going to be I don't know
[1:17:56] so but I'm am I prepared yes I'm
[1:17:59] prepared how prepared I am I'm so
[1:18:01] prepared not to say anything
[1:18:03] to make sure I really get out of the way
[1:18:05] to allow God fetch the mind of the
[1:18:07] people because there's a regard look
[1:18:09] Church there is a living God if science
[1:18:12] has broken into uh the the realm of
[1:18:15] human mind until they can invent a
[1:18:18] device called a liar detector that can
[1:18:21] be able to detect the vibration in a man
[1:18:24] to tell that that man is lying have much
[1:18:27] more for you and I to know there is a
[1:18:29] living God it's a living God and I pray
[1:18:33] God this morning that that is what you
[1:18:35] and I will be able to take a trip and
[1:18:38] break into where that Living God is
[1:18:41] because that's what Christmas is all
[1:18:43] about Christmas is all about Christmas
[1:18:46] tree and argument of people bringing
[1:18:49] quotes where brother Brown said he has
[1:18:51] Christmas tree or bringing quote why you
[1:18:53] have Christmas light in your house I
[1:18:54] don't have time for those things if you
[1:18:56] want to argue on those things keep on
[1:18:58] arguing I am looking for where God is
[1:19:00] hiding
[1:19:03] amen because that's where I want to hide
[1:19:04] because the world is boiling and and
[1:19:07] it's getting to the point it's going to
[1:19:09] blow up
[1:19:11] so it is becoming so obvious to me that
[1:19:15] I have to find where God is at
[1:19:18] and it's not as easy as it was two
[1:19:21] thousand years ago crowd was following
[1:19:24] him you could see him as a man
[1:19:26] it was not it's not easy as that now
[1:19:28] it's not a man that you can just look
[1:19:31] for
[1:19:33] but he has become a spirit living in
[1:19:35] people so I have to find where he's at
[1:19:38] and identify with him
[1:19:40] because the world is falling apart it is
[1:19:43] obvious to me
[1:19:45] men a lot of force we left Africa and we
[1:19:48] came to America we left Africa not
[1:19:51] because Africa was was bad bad but it
[1:19:54] was economically bad that's why we left
[1:19:57] it was economically bad and there was no
[1:20:00] social rule of law was kind of weak they
[1:20:04] have laws but it was weak it only worked
[1:20:06] for some good some great people and
[1:20:08] don't work for song Amen
[1:20:10] there's no country in Africa that don't
[1:20:11] have all the laws you have here in
[1:20:13] America
[1:20:14] but it just worked for some people and
[1:20:16] doesn't work for some amen amen if you
[1:20:18] steal a bread
[1:20:19] they can cut off your hand and somebody
[1:20:21] can steal millions of dollars and they
[1:20:24] will sing special number for that person
[1:20:25] it's just how it works
[1:20:30] you can be caught stealing a a piece of
[1:20:34] uh meat in the market and they can beat
[1:20:37] you up and sleep you naked and probably
[1:20:39] even throw tires on you and set you
[1:20:42] Ablaze on fire
[1:20:43] and somebody will steal trillions of
[1:20:46] dollars
[1:20:48] and they will sing special number for
[1:20:50] that person that person will even come
[1:20:52] to the house of God and give you
[1:20:54] testimony of how God bless him
[1:20:58] this is the reality
[1:21:00] so while we left there we didn't leave
[1:21:03] Africa and came here because we were
[1:21:06] coming to Heaven if that is why you came
[1:21:07] you have been deceived
[1:21:10] because you can realize now that you are
[1:21:11] not in heaven
[1:21:15] we left there because of the economic uh
[1:21:18] situation and the the disconnection that
[1:21:20] we have with what we are seeing in other
[1:21:23] world but here we are now we can eat
[1:21:25] good food after we've done some of us we
[1:21:27] stop in the buffet and we can after
[1:21:30] eating the buffet you can take some
[1:21:31] picture and send it to a Liberia Nigeria
[1:21:34] to show them that you are the guy you
[1:21:36] know you have arrived you you are no
[1:21:38] more their mate you are no more in their
[1:21:40] class you can so you can put it on
[1:21:41] Facebook Tick Tock and all the all the
[1:21:44] things that the devil has brought under
[1:21:46] heaven so that you can show the people
[1:21:48] that look I'm no more in your category I
[1:21:50] have been uplifted God has blessed me
[1:21:54] you you can show them all of that but
[1:21:56] here we are now when we begin to devote
[1:22:00] our life to the Living God they will
[1:22:02] begin to realize that there is another
[1:22:04] message yes
[1:22:08] we begin to realize that there is
[1:22:10] another mess here we begin to send our
[1:22:13] kids to school and we begin to send our
[1:22:15] kids to school and we are going to our
[1:22:17] job and then we begin to see laws that
[1:22:20] begin to make us uncomfortable
[1:22:26] begin to see the president of the United
[1:22:28] States
[1:22:30] a few years back that same man Joseph
[1:22:34] Biden he would say with his own lips
[1:22:37] that what is the game what kind of game
[1:22:39] is going on here that every state to
[1:22:42] respect uh uh uh uh the the law of
[1:22:45] marriage
[1:22:47] he said marriage is between man and a
[1:22:48] woman I can show you the video I can
[1:22:51] show you of four or three interviews
[1:22:53] that he had he said what is the game say
[1:22:56] what game is going on so at that point
[1:22:58] in time Joseph Biden realized that there
[1:23:01] was a game going on in America that what
[1:23:04] is the push for why are you pushing that
[1:23:06] marriage should be twisted for man and
[1:23:08] woman to become woman a woman a woman a
[1:23:11] dog or whatever you can even get married
[1:23:12] to a stick or whatever Oh serious this
[1:23:15] is no fun somebody got married to a
[1:23:17] train station
[1:23:19] in Europe this is serious this is no
[1:23:21] joke
[1:23:21] they show you that the world is going
[1:23:24] crazy
[1:23:27] and somebody got married to a dog
[1:23:30] and how far can we push this
[1:23:35] and now if you are not spiritual it
[1:23:37] doesn't really matter to us it doesn't
[1:23:38] matter it's just we should not let's not
[1:23:40] argue too much with them after all we
[1:23:42] are not the one marrying men let's not
[1:23:45] push it too much let's just leave let's
[1:23:47] just live Let's Love
[1:23:51] It's All About Love
[1:23:55] so we begin to realize that's if you are
[1:23:58] spiritual you begin to realize that
[1:24:00] we're in a teaching point
[1:24:02] you are no more what you thought was
[1:24:04] Comfort it's no more comfort you begin
[1:24:06] to look more narrow you are no more
[1:24:08] looking in a broad perspective I say all
[1:24:10] is well you begin to realize that all is
[1:24:12] not well you begin to see the the
[1:24:15] scenario of Sodom and you begin to
[1:24:18] realize that destruction is coming you
[1:24:21] begin to become obvious to you you could
[1:24:23] smell it
[1:24:25] right that man has gotten to the point
[1:24:27] that he wants to destroy himself
[1:24:30] and people are clapping
[1:24:34] on the 12th of December the president
[1:24:36] signed into law what he called Marriage
[1:24:38] Act
[1:24:40] so pretty much redefining marriage and
[1:24:42] force it on every state in America must
[1:24:45] obey that law
[1:24:48] that's what he said and that's what he
[1:24:50] said
[1:24:50] and when he said it everybody said yay
[1:24:53] they were all happy
[1:24:55] myself and Danny were watching the
[1:24:57] watching it yesterday and he said to to
[1:24:59] present Equity decency I said what is so
[1:25:02] decent with the mama and a man that's
[1:25:04] not a decent there but you see in his
[1:25:07] own mind like we just said there's the
[1:25:09] real world and there is your mind and
[1:25:12] but Abraham will tell us as Paul we also
[1:25:15] won he said because they did not retain
[1:25:17] God in their heart God will give them
[1:25:20] over towards their minds they will go
[1:25:22] into strong delusion now everything that
[1:25:26] they are doing will be in their mind
[1:25:28] everything will be okay in their mind
[1:25:31] because their minds are being said with
[1:25:34] hot iron
[1:25:35] oh yeah
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:42] and so I got to the
[1:25:45] I got to the end of the day I told my
[1:25:48] wife I said okay I'm going to have to
[1:25:50] stay in the resource rooms like I really
[1:25:52] try to spend some time and pray because
[1:25:55] I realized my whole day has been a shred
[1:25:58] so let me spend some time and just try
[1:26:01] to get all the pieces together and bring
[1:26:04] it to God and see what God we have for
[1:26:06] the Sunday service
[1:26:09] I went to the church I made the pastor
[1:26:12] we shook hand and I sat down and the
[1:26:15] pastor called me and then we had a good
[1:26:18] time in the Lord and my wife was like oh
[1:26:20] wow I
[1:26:21] how how the message was so powerful but
[1:26:24] you didn't really have time it's not
[1:26:27] whether you have time it's whether God
[1:26:29] have time
[1:26:31] and that's what Abraham said we have to
[1:26:33] master human ability when we understand
[1:26:36] what this is all about it's not about
[1:26:39] brother Stephen coming to bring one
[1:26:40] great message that's not what this is
[1:26:42] all about it could have been a tip that
[1:26:44] you press play it could have been but an
[1:26:46] airplane a song it could have been
[1:26:48] sister Kelly singing a special it could
[1:26:50] have been any of the body but iron just
[1:26:52] hitting the drum it could have been
[1:26:54] sister Fatu singing you know special it
[1:26:56] could have been brought Steve singing
[1:26:57] especially I could have been since it
[1:26:59] could have been anybody because God is
[1:27:01] not but Andrew
[1:27:02] God is not bro Steve
[1:27:04] but in bro Steve's mind like oh this
[1:27:07] this is God that's your mind please come
[1:27:09] out of your mind and come to the real
[1:27:11] world
[1:27:13] I pray God help us to begin to think in
[1:27:15] that way
[1:27:16] so you can learn to appreciate one
[1:27:18] another
[1:27:19] because in your mind it is you but when
[1:27:22] you come to the real world God is in his
[1:27:24] people
[1:27:25] it's not you it's in his people
[1:27:28] but Abraham said the only physical body
[1:27:30] God has now
[1:27:33] it's not brother Steve
[1:27:36] even though there are many brothers
[1:27:37] still here this morning
[1:27:41] it's not bro bill
[1:27:42] need that brother
[1:27:45] it is his people
[1:27:48] and if God the only physical body God
[1:27:51] has now if it's his people how much more
[1:27:55] we supposed to respect one another
[1:27:58] see many of us don't have revelation we
[1:28:00] don't have Revelation what we call
[1:28:02] Revelation is just your mind you are
[1:28:04] living in your mind the evidence of it
[1:28:07] is what your life is producing right
[1:28:11] right
[1:28:13] because what you're calling Revelation
[1:28:14] is just your mind oh because I believe
[1:28:17] brother Brown is a prophet that doesn't
[1:28:18] make you a stick he doesn't make a
[1:28:19] Christian
[1:28:21] you can even sow a garment without a
[1:28:23] brown Spiller fire picture he doesn't
[1:28:24] even make it nothing

[1:28:38] believer why do you think you are a
[1:28:39] Believer because you can record

[1:28:59] computer you also put a brand picture in
[1:29:01] your house that computer is not a
[1:29:02] Believer why do you think you are a
[1:29:03] believer

[1:29:07] oh I think only belief only believe also
[1:29:09] can be sung on the radio and the radio
[1:29:11] is not a Believer why do you think you
[1:29:12] are a Believer because you sang only
[1:29:14] believe they always stand on the radio
[1:29:15] they read it's not a Believer why do you
[1:29:17] think you're a believer
[1:29:19] you see brother when we come into that
[1:29:22] fair many of our arrogancy withdraw and
[1:29:25] the true freshness of Christianity what
[1:29:29] God really want to do in your life will
[1:29:30] begin to come out
[1:29:36] the real thing God wants to do in your
[1:29:38] life will begin to come out because we
[1:29:41] have to Humble ourselves we have we we
[1:29:44] if for anything we need to be humbled
[1:29:49] we need to come to God just as we are
[1:29:53] but we are not
[1:29:55] suppose we are praying we haven't given
[1:29:57] God quote
[1:29:59] we'll try not to preach the message to
[1:30:01] God
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:05] instead of coming the way you are you
[1:30:07] have you you have almost you you are
[1:30:09] even fighting with your wife if you die
[1:30:11] this woman you know in your heart that
[1:30:13] you're joining towards God it's a
[1:30:15] question mark you know it and yet you
[1:30:18] are nearly that God is 70 page five what
[1:30:20] are you talking about
[1:30:27] oh we believe the message we must
[1:30:30] believe that what what what are you
[1:30:32] talking about can you please explain
[1:30:33] what you mean by we as a believer
[1:30:38] when in your heart it takes 10 men to
[1:30:41] grab you not to make the wrong decision
[1:30:45] if you fly loose this all this old
[1:30:48] building can can go in flames
[1:30:51] and you can see it quote after that
[1:30:56] to show why you said the beauty of Fire
[1:31:02] in case you don't know okay never
[1:31:05] worship the devil
[1:31:07] in case we don't know
[1:31:08] kid never worship the devil he never
[1:31:11] worshiped the devil
[1:31:14] he was a gentleman that came to church
[1:31:18] and he he was so concerned with he won
[1:31:21] the presence of God to look beautiful
[1:31:25] but he did not care about character he
[1:31:27] didn't care about the character
[1:31:29] but all he care about is to put flower
[1:31:31] the puppet has to be my Sonia would the
[1:31:34] cross have to be he cares so much about
[1:31:36] those little little my new things
[1:31:40] but he did not care that his anger can
[1:31:43] make him kill a brother I didn't care
[1:31:45] about that
[1:31:49] he didn't care that when he's angry
[1:31:51] anything around him is dangerous because
[1:31:53] he becomes a tool he can kill somebody
[1:31:56] with it
[1:31:57] and when God begin to tell him what he
[1:32:00] did not care about God said came if you
[1:32:03] if you do what is right I will accept
[1:32:05] you I'm not into a gimmick of a favor
[1:32:08] right I don't choose favorites if you do
[1:32:11] what is right you'll be accepted he said
[1:32:14] okay sin is lying at your door
[1:32:19] did you listen no
[1:32:21] the fairy God he claimed to to come to
[1:32:25] worship he was not listening to that God
[1:32:28] and before we know it his finger begin
[1:32:30] to clean
[1:32:32] and before you know it the first time
[1:32:34] human blood will go down on Earth it was
[1:32:38] not done by a demon he was done by a
[1:32:40] message believer
[1:32:43] hey welcome
[1:32:45] you you say bro is that true you if you
[1:32:48] read your Bible you know that
[1:32:51] the first time human blood will be
[1:32:53] spilled on Earth it was not a man
[1:32:55] worshiping devil that killed another man
[1:32:57] it was two men worshiping the same God
[1:33:00] but the only difference was that one had
[1:33:03] revelation
[1:33:06] [Applause]
[1:33:08] where that Revelation and if you have
[1:33:11] Revelation it will affect your life
[1:33:15] so this might have Revelation the
[1:33:17] Revelation that we have affects his life
[1:33:20] so much
[1:33:21] until he decided that the blood of the
[1:33:25] Lamb should take his place
[1:33:28] it means so much to him that man's life
[1:33:31] has been messed up so something must die
[1:33:34] for me I can't stand before a holy God
[1:33:37] something has to die for me
[1:33:41] but can
[1:33:42] he didn't see the revelation of when you
[1:33:45] are coming to God death has to be
[1:33:47] involved
[1:33:49] all he saw is the beauty I'm going to
[1:33:52] have to put on some good looking clothes
[1:33:55] my shoes have to be in my hair
[1:33:58] I saw some sister would stay in the

[1:36:47] do
[1:36:49] California we sing praise God praise the
[1:36:52] message you think that's the message
[1:36:54] that is the Judgment that will come on
[1:36:56] California
[1:36:59] judgment that will come in California
[1:37:00] it's not a message
[1:37:06] what gives you Joy
[1:37:08] when you hear the word
[1:37:11] but Abraham said the greatest
[1:37:13] thing that can give you my joy is when
[1:37:16] he hear his name called
[1:37:22] when God's word call your name
[1:37:24] is it doesn't call Stephen area no he
[1:37:29] said God revealed to you that you are in
[1:37:31] that room
[1:37:32] you begin to see your character you
[1:37:35] begin to see why you repented you know
[1:37:37] see why you ask your wife for
[1:37:38] forgiveness let me not see why you
[1:37:40] apologize because I said that is me
[1:37:42] Hallelujah
[1:37:44] the world begin to call your name I

[1:37:48] the things you're supposed to do you
[1:37:50] begin the word of God is calling your
[1:37:52] name
[1:37:57] and so I picked up
[1:37:59] I got done preaching and uh drove to the
[1:38:02] airport
[1:38:03] go to the hotel picture of my cousin and
[1:38:06] I was driving home I just began to
[1:38:08] reflect on
[1:38:09] what just happened last Sunday
[1:38:12] I said the devil really
[1:38:15] was trying to relate the message
[1:38:19] he was trying to disorganize me so I can
[1:38:22] be on the way
[1:38:23] and God can be hindered
[1:38:26] but brother Brown said unbelief cannot
[1:38:29] hinder the presence of God
[1:38:35] and so we spoke
[1:38:38] dealing with me on
[1:38:40] for the past few months
[1:38:43] and coming to Minneapolis I didn't come
[1:38:47] here with a message I will tell you that
[1:38:50] but I came here to fellowship with you
[1:38:54] and I pray God give us a fellowship
[1:38:57] that will make us appreciate the true
[1:38:59] meaning
[1:39:01] of God becoming flesh
[1:39:06] let us rise this morning
[1:39:10] we may have to sing a song
[1:39:13] it's about we're gonna we're gonna rise
[1:39:15] and we're going to pray first
[1:39:17] dear father Lord
[1:39:20] we thank you for your grace
[1:39:26] Lord we thank you for your mercy
[1:39:31] I pray Lord you bless us at your
[1:39:32] children this morning
[1:39:36] may your word Lord
[1:39:39] fall into the tables of our hearts
[1:39:44] change the atmosphere Lord
[1:39:47] be real to us father
[1:39:50] that's our heart desire
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:56] show us what it truly means to have a
[1:39:58] relationship with you
[1:40:02] it's not complicated Lord you pay the
[1:40:04] price for it to happen
[1:40:07] just oh God open our eyes to see it just
[1:40:10] take humility
[1:40:11] we just have to Humble ourselves
[1:40:15] and Lord May that door of entrance be
[1:40:17] open unto us this morning
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:20] bless your word as it will be read
[1:40:24] bless the congregation this morning
[1:40:27] take me out of the way speak to your
[1:40:29] people
[1:40:31] in Jesus name of prayer Thanksgiving
[1:40:33] let's be seated I'm going to sing a song
[1:40:38] that will read the scriptures
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:43] and so the scenario begin to look like
[1:40:45] last Sunday
[1:40:48] what I won was trying to get a flight
[1:40:50] ticket
[1:40:51] he couldn't get he couldn't get a flight
[1:40:52] ticket that was uh reasonable
[1:40:56] the flight ticket was about like in a
[1:40:59] thousands
[1:41:01] I said oh my the devil doesn't want me
[1:41:03] to come
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:05] and I said we just keep praying
[1:41:08] as I told Brother one I said don't worry
[1:41:10] I'll just get her I I want my cousin to
[1:41:13] be around the world so I'll get a rental
[1:41:16] car so my mom my wife we cannot drive
[1:41:19] down
[1:41:21] so on Wednesday we are still having that
[1:41:24] plan of coming down together
[1:41:26] so my mom doesn't like traveling uh long
[1:41:29] distance
[1:41:30] along this side took about 20 hours
[1:41:32] drive she does it like that
[1:41:34] so I convinced her I said
[1:41:36] we can't we are all going to mean so
[1:41:38] that you're not going to be at home by
[1:41:39] yourself so it'll be good you you join
[1:41:42] along with us you say okay everybody was
[1:41:44] in agreement
[1:41:47] Thursday we started hearing about the
[1:41:49] weather advisory
[1:41:52] it looked like the weather was not good
[1:41:55] Colorado Wisconsin Kansas
[1:41:58] we're wreckage all around the place
[1:42:00] and so I said well uh
[1:42:03] you all are no more going I will come
[1:42:05] just with my cousin he and I can drive
[1:42:07] down because I just wanted him and his
[1:42:09] wife to be around where the word of God
[1:42:11] is being preached
[1:42:15] and that's the plan
[1:42:17] during his visit that's what I have in
[1:42:19] mind for him and his wife
[1:42:21] and while they're around they can uh
[1:42:23] they can get to attend church with us
[1:42:26] and get to fellowship with the Saints
[1:42:32] and so we had all that planned and then
[1:42:34] I I started getting worried
[1:42:37] about driving
[1:42:39] now I'm hearing all about the weather
[1:42:41] advisory I said how will I be driving
[1:42:43] into the storm when I know that it's
[1:42:45] there I mean it doesn't it doesn't make
[1:42:47] sense
[1:42:48] all right that's why
[1:42:50] I said now I'm going to tell my cousin
[1:42:52] that it's not going how is it going to
[1:42:54] feel
[1:42:55] so I said well I'm just going to pray
[1:42:56] about it
[1:42:58] and I pray that I said well because of
[1:43:00] the weather I'm going to fly and uh
[1:43:03] would not be able to drive
[1:43:07] and so I tried to get a ticket
[1:43:08] the ticket was just too expensive
[1:43:12] and so I tried another route
[1:43:14] which is close to my office it's like
[1:43:16] two hours away from my house
[1:43:19] a Richmond
[1:43:20] so I got a ticket that was quite uh
[1:43:23] reasonable
[1:43:25] and I said well I have to drive two
[1:43:27] hours to to be able to fly out of that
[1:43:28] airport
[1:43:30] it did everything begin to fall in place
[1:43:32] slowly
[1:43:34] until after seeing cancellation of
[1:43:37] flight
[1:43:39] and there but the one called me I was
[1:43:42] driving to the airport
[1:43:45] the wind was just so intense I never
[1:43:48] seen it like that before usually when I
[1:43:51] drive like most of us drive we use one
[1:43:52] hand is that right because you are very
[1:43:54] good you know unto you you get uh
[1:43:57] you go into a car wreck
[1:44:00] you know people that don't know how to
[1:44:01] drive they don't get into career because
[1:44:02] they don't drive and it's people that
[1:44:04] know how to drive that get into
[1:44:06] correct because they know how to drive
[1:44:08] you know until they use one finger to be
[1:44:10] touching the steering wheel and then
[1:44:11] they bang it or somebody then they
[1:44:13] realize that oh snap I didn't mean to do
[1:44:15] that
[1:44:16] so but this time in many years I have to
[1:44:19] hold the steering wheel with both hands
[1:44:22] because the wind was just sweeping my
[1:44:24] vehicle left and right and my vehicle is
[1:44:25] heavy on the ground so I knew something
[1:44:27] was not right when I got close to the
[1:44:29] tunnel I saw the sea was roaring the sea
[1:44:32] was just so angry I'm like this is
[1:44:35] really terrible
[1:44:36] so when I was getting close to the
[1:44:37] airport with a lot of trees I couldn't
[1:44:39] feel the the wind no more I said Thank
[1:44:41] You Lord
[1:44:41] and I got to the airport
[1:44:44] the flight was supposed to be about 6 15
[1:44:46] and we got to the airport this is 6 48.
[1:44:49] and one thing after the order and then
[1:44:53] but I want we called me and we're
[1:44:54] talking on the phone he said
[1:44:57] kind of what he was looking at it
[1:44:59] depends on what the weather is going to
[1:45:00] be
[1:45:01] there may not be service
[1:45:03] I said well I'm already on my way so if
[1:45:07] I if I get there there may not be a lot
[1:45:09] of people say if it's only two people
[1:45:10] because brother must get you to pick me
[1:45:12] up if is only brother and his family
[1:45:14] would get to fellowship with I'll be on
[1:45:16] the plane tomorrow and be flying back to
[1:45:18] Virginia it wouldn't matter at all
[1:45:20] because Luke church is becoming more
[1:45:22] real Fellowship is not numbers
[1:45:27] it's becoming more real Fellowship is
[1:45:29] not numbers Fellowship is between you
[1:45:31] and your wife
[1:45:33] if you're not married it's between you
[1:45:35] and another sister
[1:45:36] our another brother it could be on the
[1:45:39] phone you could see that and you just
[1:45:40] talk about God
[1:45:41] oh talk about your needs
[1:45:43] confess your fought one to another pray
[1:45:46] for one another and the prayer of faith
[1:45:48] shall save the sea
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:53] he didn't know what I was looking at it
[1:45:55] the devil was like well you should have
[1:45:56] been home now you left your family it's
[1:45:58] Christmas your cousin is in the house I
[1:46:00] said I just prayed about it
[1:46:04] and I got to the airport they said
[1:46:06] everybody going to Minneapolis we have
[1:46:08] to rebook their flight
[1:46:10] I said now it's getting real
[1:46:14] and the flight time is changing and
[1:46:16] changing and
[1:46:18] I went to the front desk and lady said
[1:46:20] you may be able to catch a flight but in
[1:46:22] case you don't catch a flight you may
[1:46:24] have to stay at the hotel and fly on
[1:46:26] Saturday morning I said no I don't think
[1:46:28] I want to do that
[1:46:31] then I thought of it I said well
[1:46:33] I use the military term for this I would
[1:46:35] buy the bullet
[1:46:37] that means I will I will take the risk
[1:46:40] I said I will buy the bullet and then I
[1:46:42] didn't reschedule my flight I went to
[1:46:45] sit down
[1:46:46] I said the worst come to the worst I'm
[1:46:48] still going to be here
[1:46:49] yeah
[1:46:51] this is a shotgun visit tomorrow morning
[1:46:53] I'm flying back to
[1:46:55] Virginia
[1:46:58] and then we got into the flight I
[1:47:02] that when we're getting close to
[1:47:03] Cincinnati it was obvious to me
[1:47:06] my flight was already burning it was
[1:47:09] obvious because I was looking at it I
[1:47:11] didn't get no text message that the
[1:47:12] flight the schedule changed in
[1:47:14] Cincinnati
[1:47:16] the flight schedules to stay true
[1:47:18] and so many people in the plane we were
[1:47:20] really crushing you know people they
[1:47:23] can't hold themselves oh they cursing
[1:47:24] the heavens and causing the Earth
[1:47:26] because their flights were canceled and
[1:47:28] the person sitting next to me was ready
[1:47:29] kind of G train oh man and he's already
[1:47:33] grumbling because he was going to stay
[1:47:36] he was going to stay at the hotel until
[1:47:38] on Sunday until today
[1:47:40] so it was bad for so many people
[1:47:42] and I just said in my mind as soon as
[1:47:44] the flight hit the deck I would run into
[1:47:46] the the next gate
[1:47:50] so that's when I see in the deck I'm
[1:47:51] waiting and people are slow and I'm
[1:47:54] looking I said this flight is gonna It's
[1:47:57] Gonna Leave
[1:47:58] and this boarding I'm looking at no text
[1:48:00] message saying the flight schedule was
[1:48:01] changed and people are slow I just
[1:48:03] realized myself I said God Just Have
[1:48:05] Your Way
[1:48:06] and then I got out of the flight I
[1:48:08] started running to the the gate I got to
[1:48:10] the gate I see the gator stage I said my
[1:48:13] this is strange I didn't get no text
[1:48:14] message saying the gate change
[1:48:16] and so around to the the the gate they
[1:48:19] told me that the flight was going to uh
[1:48:21] the departing from
[1:48:23] there was nobody there at all I was the
[1:48:25] last man to enter the flight
[1:48:29] when I got into the flight I said praise
[1:48:31] God
[1:48:32] [Music]
[1:48:34] and then it began to be so clear to me
[1:48:37] that God has something to say to
[1:48:40] somebody
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:43] when brother said they will not be
[1:48:45] serviced uh Saturday it didn't bug me
[1:48:48] I said because already I fellowship with
[1:48:50] Danny he and already have Fellowship
[1:48:54] and uh
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:57] Amen in uh and God's way according to
[1:49:00] Wise Men When when when when you see me
[1:49:04] and these two young boys when we are
[1:49:06] fellowshipping you think I'm talking to
[1:49:08] some old men and they they flow they
[1:49:10] really flow so I call them my two wise
[1:49:12] men and so I said if this is all I can
[1:49:15] Fellowship
[1:49:16] I'm it's good for me to I can fly back
[1:49:19] it's unfortunate I cannot visit the
[1:49:21] brethren
[1:49:22] last time I came I couldn't visit some
[1:49:24] some of the president's home you're
[1:49:26] visiting your home means a whole lot
[1:49:29] I lived here for four years before I was
[1:49:31] transferred to Virginia so you may not
[1:49:34] value yourself but you mean a whole lot
[1:49:36] in my heart because I know you're a
[1:49:38] Christian
[1:49:40] in your struggle many of us have various
[1:49:42] struggle I still know you're a Christian
[1:49:43] with your struggle
[1:49:46] and that Fellowship means a whole lot to
[1:49:48] me
[1:49:49] your face means a whole lot he may not
[1:49:52] mean the whole lot to you because you're
[1:49:53] spending time looking at some silly
[1:49:55] Hollywood magazine and thinking your
[1:49:57] chick has fell down and and you don't
[1:49:59] look pretty it doesn't matter
[1:50:01] but there's something about a child of
[1:50:03] God seeing a child of God
[1:50:07] I don't know how the devil may have
[1:50:09] reduced you to yourself and make you
[1:50:10] look of no word at all
[1:50:13] but I want to tell you this money you
[1:50:15] mean something to God
[1:50:17] and every child of God desire to spend
[1:50:20] some time with you
[1:50:22] do your job may not allow that but a
[1:50:24] little minute or the little seconds
[1:50:25] believer sit with you and just chat it's
[1:50:28] a blessing
[1:50:29] Heaven Rejoice to say that happens
[1:50:34] I wish we can have that very often
[1:50:36] one of these days the time brother will
[1:50:38] be caught up
[1:50:40] we will not have to work no more
[1:50:42] you will not have to worry about all the
[1:50:44] sins and the mistake and all these
[1:50:46] things the devil is choosing to chase
[1:50:48] you left and right
[1:50:50] you will not have to worry about them no
[1:50:52] more
[1:50:53] all of those will be dropped behind
[1:50:56] and you will cross into God's mercy
[1:51:06] and so I believe God is going to speak
[1:51:07] to us

[1:58:10] this morning God bless you bless the
[1:58:13] musicians and bless the church let's
[1:58:15] just turn to as to those 38 don't worry
[1:58:17] I know you may be thinking oh we're
[1:58:19] going to have a long service we're going
[1:58:20] to close very soon amen we
[1:58:22] I think we already have the service
[1:58:24] maybe we just read the Bible and we see
[1:58:26] what God will say we can go home and eat
[1:58:28] the chicken and we can light the candle
[1:58:32] on the cake and celebrate the birthday
[1:58:34] of Jesus if Jesus was born today at all
[1:58:36] amen
[1:58:38] amen praise be to His holy name let's
[1:58:41] turn to Exodus 38 I'm going to read uh
[1:58:44] two scriptures we're going to read
[1:58:45] Exodus 38 and we're going to read Psalm
[1:58:48] 91.
[1:59:05] Exodus 38 and Psalm 91
[1:59:10] we're not going to do a lot of reading
[1:59:12] I'm going to be quoting a lot of the
[1:59:14] scriptures but we're just going to take
[1:59:15] this to reading Exodus 38 and uh he said
[1:59:18] I besieged Thee show me thy Glory
[1:59:22] now Psalm 91 verse 1 reads like this he
[1:59:26] that dwelleth in the sacred place of the
[1:59:29] most high shall abide under the shadows
[1:59:32] of the almighty may the Lord have bless
[1:59:35] you into the reading of his word shall
[1:59:37] be seated
[1:59:43] today the world I chose today to
[1:59:46] celebrate what they call the birthday of
[1:59:48] Jesus Christ and which uh we're
[1:59:52] privileged by the grace of God to know
[1:59:54] that Jesus was not born today and even
[1:59:57] if he was born today there is nothing
[1:59:59] spectacular about celebrating a day
[2:00:02] because Jesus did not come for you to
[2:00:05] celebrate day weeks month it didn't come
[2:00:07] for that it came just from one purpose
[2:00:09] to reconnect you with your creator
[2:00:12] that's it
[2:00:13] so if you're going to celebrate anything
[2:00:15] at all is to celebrate a relationship
[2:00:17] with God that's it that's all it came
[2:00:19] for it didn't came it didn't come for
[2:00:21] you to be rich or for you to be poor it
[2:00:23] didn't come for you to look good it
[2:00:25] didn't come for you to even have a wife
[2:00:26] in case you don't know that
[2:00:28] so if you have wife give God praise and
[2:00:30] if you don't have also give me praise
[2:00:31] yeah
[2:00:33] yeah let's say Amen to that
[2:00:36] those that have those that don't have it
[2:00:37] didn't come for any of those things but
[2:00:40] all those things are benefits that also
[2:00:42] goes with which is coming but he came
[2:00:45] for one thing to connect you back to
[2:00:47] your creator
[2:00:48] that's why Christ came
[2:00:50] he came to connect you back to your
[2:00:52] creator and that's what we're going to
[2:00:54] look at this morning so we can wrap this
[2:00:55] gift there's a gift uh before us this
[2:00:58] morning we're going to try by the grace
[2:01:00] of God you and I we're going to try and
[2:01:02] focus as we take one rap after the other
[2:01:05] and see the greatest gift that God can
[2:01:08] give to the man that greatest gift is
[2:01:11] not a vape a cigarette that's not it
[2:01:14] yeah because for the smoker they thought
[2:01:16] that that was the greatest invention
[2:01:17] because we're no more smoking and
[2:01:19] lighting Matchstick and doing this now
[2:01:21] we just have something you can put all
[2:01:23] kind of flavor on it strawberry flavor
[2:01:25] and devil flavor and you flavor yourself
[2:01:27] to to your grave amen so we we we're not
[2:01:31] looking at that you may think that's the
[2:01:32] greatest invention of science but but
[2:01:34] it's it's not what we're talking about
[2:01:35] we're going to trust God help us this
[2:01:37] money to unwrap the greatest gift that
[2:01:40] can ever be given to humankind
[2:01:43] and so we start back our journey
[2:01:45] beginning Genesis because we want to see
[2:01:48] why this world looks so cursed this
[2:01:50] world that we're living in today why
[2:01:51] does it look so cursed we're going to go
[2:01:53] back to Genesis there are many values
[2:01:56] that have been lost through the true
[2:01:58] time as time goes on people begin to
[2:02:00] lose values they begin to lose values
[2:02:02] and we are right in the position we are
[2:02:05] in today values have been lost and so we
[2:02:08] think this Society has always been it
[2:02:10] has not always been like this
[2:02:12] at one time the whole world knew that it
[2:02:15] was God
[2:02:16] at one time the whole world knew the one
[2:02:19] true God
[2:02:21] at one time the whole world knew that
[2:02:23] the whole world knew the one true God
[2:02:25] and that's why I told you in Genesis
[2:02:27] chapter 4 Cain and Abel worshiped the
[2:02:30] same God
[2:02:32] it was not different God Cain was not
[2:02:35] worshiping Lucifer even even though he
[2:02:37] came from that line he was still the
[2:02:39] understanding was to worship the true
[2:02:41] Living God so Cain and Abel worshiped
[2:02:44] the true Living God the only difference
[2:02:47] in their worship was how they came one
[2:02:50] came spiritually one came physically
[2:02:55] so the same thing happened in the church
[2:02:57] this morning we have all come into the
[2:02:59] house of God there is seek Cain and Abel
[2:03:01] worship
[2:03:02] in one of the Christmas messages brother
[2:03:04] Brown preached he titled why it has to
[2:03:07] be Shepherd and brother Brown was saying
[2:03:09] that message but Abraham said any
[2:03:11] worship that is without Revelation is
[2:03:13] Cain worship
[2:03:16] right but the brother said anything you
[2:03:17] do with that Revelation is sin
[2:03:20] and so sin is not just fighting and and
[2:03:23] smoking and killing a committing
[2:03:25] adultery all those are fruits that sin
[2:03:28] produces
[2:03:30] sin is unbelief when you disbelieve God
[2:03:33] then your life would produce all those
[2:03:35] things
[2:03:38] so Cain and Abel they worship the one
[2:03:41] and true Living God
[2:03:43] now before Cain and Abel we we know the
[2:03:46] Genesis account how Genesis 1 we we
[2:03:49] unfold the story if you find out Moses
[2:03:51] did not say in the beginning God created
[2:03:53] Pluto Mass Jupiter Venus Moses did not
[2:03:57] go into all of those mess that people
[2:03:59] are trying to dive into today Moses went
[2:04:02] right straight into the message and what
[2:04:04] they said in the beginning God created
[2:04:07] the heavens and the Earth the message
[2:04:09] Moses passed right there is that in the
[2:04:11] beginning God created so Moses passed a
[2:04:15] message that everything you're going to
[2:04:17] see from this point or came from God
[2:04:21] so Moses in his message established a
[2:04:24] Creator that's the first thing you need
[2:04:26] it didn't go into eschatology trying to
[2:04:28] teach you grammar he went into who God
[2:04:30] is
[2:04:31] in the beginning God that the emphasis
[2:04:34] is God and creation comes from him
[2:04:38] say in the beginning God created the
[2:04:41] heavens and the Earth and Moses went on
[2:04:43] and the kid will tell us the frosting he
[2:04:45] created the second thing he created and
[2:04:47] how creation begin to unfold slowly
[2:04:49] Moses begin to show us some people call
[2:04:52] it the 10 commandment of creation Let
[2:04:54] There Be ladies
[2:04:55] ten times God will say that and God was
[2:04:58] unfolding something
[2:05:00] and finally God said it was good
[2:05:04] and everything he was creating was good
[2:05:06] in God's side and then when he came to
[2:05:08] mind said was very good
[2:05:10] now this is very good if you go to verse
[2:05:13] 26 down to 32 God said very good
[2:05:17] this man that God would say it was very
[2:05:19] good was not this man it was not this
[2:05:22] animal man we are looking at today it is
[2:05:24] a spirit man
[2:05:27] but God later on we wrap this Spirit man
[2:05:29] in an animal skin in the package or a
[2:05:32] gift wrap
[2:05:35] a vehicle which you call flesh
[2:05:38] God will allow that man to be in an
[2:05:41] animal scheme but this man was in the
[2:05:43] image of God
[2:05:45] but now God wants to give this man a
[2:05:48] domain of his own this man have to be
[2:05:50] away from God he has to be in his own
[2:05:52] domain you cannot have two King ruling
[2:05:55] one Kingdom it's not possible
[2:05:57] so now God will now project this man and
[2:06:00] put him in flesh form so he can control
[2:06:03] this old Earth
[2:06:05] so Genesis 1 will tell us that God gave
[2:06:08] my dominion over all the Earth and every
[2:06:13] living thing that's upon the face of the
[2:06:16] earth now take note of that word every
[2:06:18] living thing that is on Earth man was
[2:06:21] giving Dominion
[2:06:24] now you can give somebody Dominion it's
[2:06:26] up to him if he uses it
[2:06:29] yes it's up to him if he uses it but you
[2:06:33] can give him Dominion
[2:06:35] now in the in the in the military you
[2:06:39] can be so you can be so carried away
[2:06:41] with your faith you can so recognize
[2:06:44] your faith as a Christian until people
[2:06:46] will begin to take you for granted
[2:06:49] and then you will have to use what we
[2:06:51] call the military voice
[2:06:53] maybe you're telling somebody say I
[2:06:55] needed to I needed to do that and and
[2:06:57] it's looking at you who's talking
[2:07:00] they said I needed to do that and it's
[2:07:01] like and it's it's going about his own
[2:07:05] business
[2:07:07] and then you change the tone that's the
[2:07:09] direct order I needed to do that
[2:07:12] now a lawful order violation of a lawful
[2:07:16] order goes a long way
[2:07:19] now you can choose to go in simple
[2:07:22] language say oh you don't want to do it
[2:07:24] okay I'm going to go do it myself you
[2:07:25] can choose to do that but you can also
[2:07:27] choose to change the tone of your voice
[2:07:29] and say that's a love order
[2:07:32] a lawful order is a love order you have
[2:07:35] to follow it regardless of who you are
[2:07:37] you may not like the face of the person
[2:07:38] saying it it doesn't matter you don't
[2:07:41] look at the face you look at the order
[2:07:42] right right if it's lawful you follow it
[2:07:48] and
[2:07:49] this is what Dominion is all about so
[2:07:52] man has been giving dominion and most of
[2:07:55] the time Believers let me come to
[2:07:57] believe us I'm going to come back to my
[2:07:58] message Believers allow themselves to be
[2:08:00] bitten by the devil and they give
[2:08:02] command the devil looks at who's talking
[2:08:04] you did you say something and the devil
[2:08:07] just look at it did you say something
[2:08:08] and you allow yourself to be depressed
[2:08:10] you're allow yourself to be angry you
[2:08:12] allow yourself to be enraged and and you
[2:08:14] you you try to come out of it the devil
[2:08:16] said did you say something and you keep
[2:08:18] managing that situation and you can also
[2:08:21] come to the point and realize I am the
[2:08:24] Son of God I can't live like this
[2:08:28] I cannot live like this if I have temper
[2:08:30] problem if I have anger if I have this I
[2:08:33] will bring it to the altar
[2:08:35] I don't care who looks at me I don't
[2:08:37] care who who's God's I don't care
[2:08:39] nothing I am going to come to God's
[2:08:41] order I am going to talk to God about
[2:08:43] this until God do something I will stay
[2:08:46] there
[2:08:48] the devil could be condemning your mind
[2:08:50] telling you kill yourself smoke weed get
[2:08:52] some injection salsa into your vein and
[2:08:55] you hear all those voice you can either
[2:08:57] decide to sit there and be sipping on
[2:09:00] the orange juice or whatever and allowed
[2:09:01] to be able to beat you down or you can
[2:09:03] come to God's presence and God this is
[2:09:06] me I'm beat up
[2:09:08] the devil is directing me right now
[2:09:11] I can't go on with this I need your help
[2:09:18] so we find out one time the whole world
[2:09:21] knew that it was God
[2:09:24] and as time begin to swing
[2:09:27] man begin to consecrate on their their
[2:09:30] evil ways
[2:09:32] and how did I lost that we're seeing
[2:09:34] Genesis 1 God created the Evans on the
[2:09:36] earth in Genesis 2 God put man in flesh
[2:09:39] in Genesis 2 almost ended God created
[2:09:42] all the animals and told Adam give their
[2:09:44] names
[2:09:45] and then I'm looking lion to say that is
[2:09:47] lion
[2:09:48] he never said linga
[2:09:50] you know there's something called linga
[2:09:53] that's kind of strange
[2:09:56] that's what man made man made linger God
[2:09:58] made lion
[2:10:00] so linga is a hybrid between it's a germ
[2:10:03] taken from a lion and a tiger
[2:10:06] so they created a creature they call
[2:10:08] linga
[2:10:09] so man has gone far a man will kill
[2:10:12] himself
[2:10:15] as we're spending time right now facing
[2:10:17] on God's word people are in Siberia
[2:10:19] digging fossils
[2:10:22] trying to get uh cells because they
[2:10:25] understand the beginning of breaking God
[2:10:27] into God's laboratory and they
[2:10:29] understand what cloning is
[2:10:32] because including in science you see you
[2:10:35] can only clone what they call a somatic
[2:10:37] cell somatic cell is capable of
[2:10:39] reproducing the entire creature
[2:10:41] so science has broken into God's
[2:10:43] laboratory and they realize they can do
[2:10:45] it because in Genesis 2 God took worry
[2:10:48] from Adam God did not promote clay and
[2:10:50] put a rip to it no that reap God took
[2:10:52] from Adam said made he what the woman so
[2:10:55] that rib was capable under the presence
[2:10:58] of God to grow and become a woman
[2:11:03] let me say it this way
[2:11:05] when God took that reap from Adam God
[2:11:08] was making something that we we've made
[2:11:11] today but in a different way God made a
[2:11:14] mirror
[2:11:17] Adam never knew what he looked like
[2:11:20] but the first time Adam would know what
[2:11:22] it looked like is when God took a read
[2:11:24] from him and made a mirror called the
[2:11:27] the woman and brother mirror before Adam
[2:11:29] when that mirrors stood before Adam I
[2:11:32] don't look at that mirror he said this
[2:11:33] is my image it's part of my bone flesh
[2:11:36] to my blessing this is me
[2:11:38] so now Adam God made something that Adam
[2:11:41] can look at Adam can have a concept of
[2:11:44] what he is
[2:11:49] so you don't have problem with your wife
[2:11:52] when you have problem with your mirror
[2:11:53] you clean it properly so you can see
[2:11:54] your face
[2:11:56] so if you have problem with your wife or
[2:11:58] you upload your husband you you know
[2:12:00] what to do if you can take care some of
[2:12:02] us will go to uh I care I care and all
[2:12:05] this uh Furniture houses and we buy
[2:12:07] mirrors what thousands of dollars and
[2:12:10] you have a mirror with you that you
[2:12:11] don't even value
[2:12:15] the one that is standing on the wall
[2:12:16] with all those decoration and all of
[2:12:19] those things it can only show you this
[2:12:21] cannot show you you really are
[2:12:23] it cannot show you temper that your
[2:12:25] temper I can't show you he cannot show
[2:12:27] you your anger he cannot show your
[2:12:28] prayer lesson it cannot show you your
[2:12:30] irresponsibility
[2:12:33] that mirror on the world cannot show you
[2:12:35] how irresponsible you are if you only
[2:12:37] show you that this should fit you
[2:12:39] it is sorry that the tie looks good on
[2:12:41] you it will show you that you are the
[2:12:42] main man if you show you that you are
[2:12:45] the guy that's only to show you but it
[2:12:47] will not show you how irresponsible you
[2:12:49] are he will not show you the
[2:12:50] irresponsible husband you have grown to
[2:12:52] be called because that's not the mirror
[2:12:54] God gave you the mirror God gave you to
[2:12:57] see yourself a slave before you but you
[2:12:59] turn your back on it
[2:13:00] [Music]
[2:13:03] foreign
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:05] and then he made a mirror for Adam and
[2:13:08] when Adam looked at that mirror he said
[2:13:10] this is me
[2:13:11] this is Flesh of My Flesh
[2:13:13] this is born on my bone this is me
[2:13:18] so he gave me right now this is me woman
[2:13:20] because he were taken out of a man
[2:13:23] and so when you look at yourself on the
[2:13:25] mirror what you are seeing is what is
[2:13:26] taking out of you the mirror will not
[2:13:28] show Jeanette when you are standing on
[2:13:30] when John is standing on the mirror if
[2:13:32] you show John is that right if it's your
[2:13:34] image that you cast there so God made an
[2:13:37] image he made the Bible will tell you
[2:13:39] that later on he said man was made in
[2:13:41] the image of God and the woman was made
[2:13:43] in the image of the man
[2:13:45] so man was made in the image of God but
[2:13:48] the woman was made in the image of the
[2:13:50] man
[2:13:54] so all of this we're talking about one
[2:13:56] God understanding we know that there's
[2:13:58] just one God and this one God has taken
[2:14:00] a reap he has made a mirror for Adam so
[2:14:02] now Adam had a mirror he knows what he
[2:14:04] looked like he knows who he is he has
[2:14:06] named all the animals and he's going
[2:14:07] about his business because he has a
[2:14:09] mirror you know what I'm saying he has a
[2:14:11] mirror and God comes down to fellowship
[2:14:13] with other before Fellowship begins Adam
[2:14:16] stands before his mirror and make sure
[2:14:18] it's ready
[2:14:21] not the sister now it's not even
[2:14:23] standing before the mirror because if
[2:14:24] was the mirror
[2:14:26] let me not even use that word the woman
[2:14:28] was the mirror because God did not
[2:14:30] create Eve God created the woman the
[2:14:33] devil created Eve
[2:14:38] so we see right here God has given Adam
[2:14:41] a mirror another mirror before
[2:14:43] Fellowship begins you see God was
[2:14:45] orchestrating he was arranging
[2:14:47] Mothership God was arranging Fellowship
[2:14:50] so before Fellowship begin Adam and his
[2:14:53] mirror will first of all come in contact
[2:14:55] and prepare before God comes down
[2:14:59] So Adam has to stand before his mirror
[2:15:01] look at himself properly
[2:15:03] I said now we're good he carries me run
[2:15:05] is going to fellowship and the presence
[2:15:06] of God comes down in the garden and God
[2:15:09] is working and Adam and his mirror and
[2:15:11] God have glorious Fellowship God sees
[2:15:14] himself in Adam Adam sees himself in the
[2:15:16] mirror let's say praise God
[2:15:19] [Applause]
[2:15:20] that's what we call Fellowship
[2:15:22] God looks at the mirror God saw mirror
[2:15:24] was Adam Adam saw mirror is the woman
[2:15:28] so man is the ruler of the house that's
[2:15:32] not what was going on there
[2:15:36] and what was going on there is not some
[2:15:37] sister with some horn that I said to
[2:15:39] take the husband up and and hit him on
[2:15:41] the the overhead
[2:15:45] but what was going on here is fellowship
[2:15:47] God was putting Fellowship in
[2:15:49] perspective and fellowship should be
[2:15:52] God sees himself in Adam Adam sees
[2:15:55] himself in the woman oh God help us how
[2:15:58] girls will it be this morning if would
[2:16:00] have been said himself in his wife his
[2:16:02] wife is having that sister but you see
[2:16:04] yourself when we see ourselves in one
[2:16:07] another
[2:16:12] say proceed me you are not reading quote
[2:16:14] because I'm not going to read
[2:16:17] I'm going to preach quote
[2:16:19] but Abraham will tell us later on but
[2:16:21] Abraham said the bride is what the
[2:16:23] reflection of Christ because she is his
[2:16:26] mirror
[2:16:29] the bride is the mirror of Christ Christ
[2:16:32] looks at the bride he sees himself now
[2:16:35] when you are your wife you're having
[2:16:36] that torso when you're about ready to
[2:16:37] sign that divorce decree who are we
[2:16:39] seeing in you who is Christ seeing in
[2:16:42] you

[2:16:57] I'm not just I'm not just the girl you
[2:16:58] married some years ago I have learned
[2:17:03] who do we see at that point
[2:17:06] because Christ wants to see his
[2:17:09] reflection in this church
[2:17:11] every night at the church of Christ
[2:17:12] today how many a year at the church of
[2:17:14] Christ a new Church of Christ amen all

[2:17:35] sweet to your wife sweet to your husband
[2:17:37] you want to give quote why you should

[2:17:45] somebody son will save him and he's
[2:17:46] giving you scriptures why you should die
[2:17:48] in that pit don't you know in Versa and
[2:17:51] soft Matthew I should remain here

[2:17:58] he said in John chapter 15 The Bible
[2:18:01] said I shall remain here

[2:18:07] homes are crumbling into Shred the devil
[2:18:10] is becoming the king of your house the
[2:18:13] devil there's a special Throne you have
[2:18:15] erected in your home and the devil is

[2:18:44] taken over your home
[2:18:46] that is what is going on whether you are

[2:19:04] controlling you rage anger bitterness
[2:19:07] malice at times you cannot sleep
[2:19:10] let me give you a quote on what the
[2:19:11] brown said about that
[2:19:15] at times you can't sleep
[2:19:17] and you wonder what is going on
[2:19:19] and you are not sleeping
[2:19:21] because you have had it rough with your
[2:19:22] wife or you've had it rough with your
[2:19:25] neighbor and you are not even able to
[2:19:27] sleep guess what your neighbor is having
[2:19:29] good dreams
[2:19:33] your neighbor is having good dreams but
[2:19:35] you you are you are you are angry you
[2:19:38] are upset
[2:19:39] and your Facebook ugly your wife is
[2:19:42] probably looking at that ugly face no
[2:19:43] more because he has had that chicken and
[2:19:45] has drunk that uh
[2:19:47] strawberry smoothie
[2:19:50] and she's dreaming good dreams angels
[2:19:52] are visiting her white demons are
[2:19:53] dragging you apart
[2:19:55] your face is looking more ugly because
[2:19:56] you are you are misusing the muscles in
[2:19:58] your face science say take 70 he said
[2:20:01] take 75 percent of muscles to friend
[2:20:04] your face
[2:20:05] that's intensity
[2:20:07] it takes just 15 percent to smile
[2:20:11] so make your choice
[2:20:16] 75 percent to fry your face by just take
[2:20:19] 15 to smile
[2:20:22] and I tell you what the more you smile
[2:20:24] the better it is on your face your
[2:20:27] muscles will be relaxed when you are
[2:20:29] farming your face all the time wrinkles
[2:20:31] will be appearing no matter the
[2:20:32] Hollywood magazine you look at the
[2:20:34] bottles and the authors and the thoughts
[2:20:36] you put on your face your face will
[2:20:38] still wrinkled right
[2:20:42] in the message the infallibility of the
[2:20:45] word of God of the spoken word of God
[2:20:46] but Abraham prays that message 1946
[2:20:48] April the 4th but Abraham said it is
[2:20:51] about 60 percent of the cause of all
[2:20:54] sickness is temper
[2:20:58] this is not what 60 percent of all
[2:21:02] sickness is what temper
[2:21:07] is the cause of heart attack
[2:21:09] when you are angry you see your blood
[2:21:10] pressure Rises
[2:21:14] and when you see that brother that
[2:21:15] you're having it rough with your your
[2:21:17] heart makes life
[2:21:19] the blood begin to pump like crazy
[2:21:23] temper
[2:21:24] is 60 cause of almost all sickness
[2:21:29] diabetes
[2:21:30] but the problem we're going to tell us
[2:21:32] that life
[2:21:33] lie causes cancer
[2:21:37] he said how did he know that yes he said
[2:21:39] he could see beyond the spirit
[2:21:42] and see how things start in their
[2:21:44] infancy
[2:21:47] may God help us
[2:21:52] we're going to be drawn to the close
[2:21:53] like I said
[2:21:54] and uh
[2:21:56] god with flesh whatever we have here in
[2:21:59] our homes
[2:22:00] when you go home and you have that
[2:22:02] genuine fellowship with God
[2:22:03] when you knee down and you're talking to
[2:22:05] God say God they're talking about a rap
[2:22:08] gift it's not just Christmas of Santa
[2:22:11] Claus and all those rubbish
[2:22:14] see they've removed God from
[2:22:17] what belongs to him
[2:22:19] they removed him from his rainbow
[2:22:23] they don't even know what the rainbow is
[2:22:26] you see what they call it rainbow
[2:22:28] because it's a bow that you shoot rain
[2:22:30] out of
[2:22:32] one time in Genesis as we progressed to
[2:22:34] Genesis chapter 6 God will tell Noah
[2:22:37] man's wickedness has hit the climbers I
[2:22:40] am going to destroy the world and God
[2:22:42] will send rain to the Earth and drink
[2:22:45] overflow the Earth and people gonna die
[2:22:48] like crazy
[2:22:50] they say God did that no it is the
[2:22:52] wickedness of man that did that to man
[2:22:55] God only took his head away a man will
[2:22:58] invent what will kill himself
[2:23:01] in the bid of trying to be smart he
[2:23:03] would destroy himself
[2:23:06] and so God he put that that ball in the
[2:23:09] sky after the war was over brother Steve
[2:23:11] God put that ball in the sky say
[2:23:13] whenever you see that ball
[2:23:15] the rainbow
[2:23:16] see what you call it rainbow he's an I
[2:23:19] was born it's a boat that you shoot the
[2:23:20] rain out of because when you see the
[2:23:22] rain falling from the sky it looks like
[2:23:23] a arrow is that right so God shot the
[2:23:26] judgment and God kept the bowl in the
[2:23:28] sky you see anytime you see the ball it
[2:23:30] means I'm not fighting wall
[2:23:32] so you know that you know that that's a
[2:23:34] sign that I will not destroy the Earth
[2:23:36] with water no more
[2:23:38] now people took that rainbow and they
[2:23:41] say you can marry a man can get married
[2:23:43] to a man a woman can get married to
[2:23:44] woman that's what it represents
[2:23:47] until you cannot even carry rainbow if
[2:23:49] you wear a shirt that's rainbow only God
[2:23:51] will be merciful to you
[2:23:53] even people that claim to be Christian
[2:23:54] they'll be looking at you strange that
[2:23:57] what just happened
[2:23:59] as he changed his mind has he lost it
[2:24:02] because they don't know what the rainbow
[2:24:03] is the rainbow represents God's mercy to
[2:24:06] you and me
[2:24:07] it doesn't represent the man marrying a
[2:24:09] woman and man marrying a man a woman it
[2:24:11] doesn't even represent any of those
[2:24:12] rubbish that men has made it today he
[2:24:15] doesn't even go close to that nonsense
[2:24:17] but what it means is that God is not
[2:24:19] going to judge this world and destroy it
[2:24:20] by water
[2:24:23] so we come to Genesis 4. Genesis 2 we
[2:24:26] see God took a mirror and then gave man
[2:24:28] the mirror a man will look at this
[2:24:30] mirror brother Steve he will know what
[2:24:32] he looks like and God will look at Adam
[2:24:34] God knows what he looked like as a man
[2:24:36] because God was never a man so for God
[2:24:38] knows what he looked like as a man so
[2:24:42] Adam was God's mirror of humanity if you
[2:24:44] want to know what God looked like as a
[2:24:46] man in animal skin look at Adam
[2:24:49] because either the spirit Son of God has
[2:24:52] been placed in flesh in Genesis 2 the
[2:24:54] Bible said God break the doors and put
[2:24:57] Adam said bread into that that nostril
[2:24:59] and Adam became a living Soul so the
[2:25:01] spirit God and His Spirit Soul he put
[2:25:03] his Spirit son in flesh
[2:25:05] now God's son now lives in flesh God is
[2:25:08] looking at Adam to see what God looked
[2:25:11] like in substance
[2:25:13] to see what God looked like in time in
[2:25:16] space in matter now God can see what he
[2:25:18] looked like
[2:25:20] because God is not flesh but now God
[2:25:22] knows what they look like in flesh when
[2:25:24] he's looking at Adam
[2:25:26] God did not name the animals he allowed
[2:25:28] them to name the animal because any name
[2:25:31] Adam gave them Bible said that was the
[2:25:32] name because Adam has the mind of God
[2:25:37] when you call your wife the b word where
[2:25:39] did that come from
[2:25:42] when you call your husband some crazy
[2:25:44] name where did that come from
[2:25:47] Adam not the mind of God and he said
[2:25:50] lion tiger Dove he was speaking the mind
[2:25:53] of God when you tell your husband this
[2:25:55] madman you are a Madman
[2:25:57] you can't do me nothing I will call the
[2:25:59] police on you where did that come from
[2:26:02] that obviously is not the mind of God it
[2:26:05] is a mind of somebody else you are
[2:26:07] expressing someone that person's mind
[2:26:09] and if it is not the mind of God it is
[2:26:12] the mind of the devil
[2:26:14] that doesn't mean you are condemned it's
[2:26:16] just me you have the wrong Channel we
[2:26:18] have to tune you again
[2:26:20] no when you have the radio those days
[2:26:22] and you're looking for a son and you are
[2:26:24] tuning already with the tuna you're
[2:26:25] hearing some Statics and cheese sweet
[2:26:27] dreams
[2:26:28] and then you you try and hear some
[2:26:31] violin I mean static
[2:26:36] [Applause]
[2:26:50] shed that that tone
[2:26:52] of God's Amazing Grace and that's what
[2:26:55] we see right there the Adam at that
[2:26:57] point God could see himself in Adam Adam
[2:26:59] could see himself in Eve and then we
[2:27:01] come to Genesis 3. this beauty was
[2:27:03] wrecked
[2:27:06] suppressive God could see himself in
[2:27:09] other Adam Adam could see himself in Eve
[2:27:10] and God in the woman and God came down
[2:27:14] and the fellowship is going on and
[2:27:16] before God comes down Adam first of all
[2:27:18] make sure very well he's seeing himself
[2:27:20] in the woman and then God comes down and
[2:27:23] God makes sure he's seeing himself in
[2:27:25] Adam
[2:27:26] but all of a sudden Buddies
[2:27:28] that faithful service they came
[2:27:31] God came down the rap gift came down
[2:27:34] again he comes every time and that day
[2:27:37] came to see himself in Adam he could not
[2:27:39] find Adam
[2:27:42] he was not in charge that day
[2:27:45] he had every reason
[2:27:47] to give no digging can talk to him after
[2:27:49] not is not paying my bill
[2:27:52] you don't know how hard I have to work
[2:27:54] to pay my bill so if you don't see me in
[2:27:56] church you have no right to come and
[2:27:57] talk to me
[2:27:58] Adam where did that come from
[2:28:02] the Bible said they were both naked and
[2:28:04] we are not ashamed yes Adam now God said
[2:28:07] Adam he said he said where you are you
[2:28:09] say God I'm hiding I'm ashamed I'm
[2:28:10] afraid because what is going on where
[2:28:12] did you get those language from
[2:28:14] now God has come to see himself in his
[2:28:17] son his son is hiding and speaking some
[2:28:19] dirty language
[2:28:21] I'm afraid
[2:28:23] where did you where did you get that
[2:28:25] from
[2:28:27] how did you learn the language fear
[2:28:29] where did that come from
[2:28:33] and I'm hiding where are you hiding not
[2:28:36] in God's secret place he was hiding
[2:28:38] behind leaves fig leaves
[2:28:41] remember in Psalms that we just read
[2:28:43] he said he that dwelleth in the sacred
[2:28:46] place of the most high
[2:28:48] so I'm Pride
[2:28:50] shall dwell in the shadows of the
[2:28:53] Almighty
[2:28:54] yes the Shadows of the almighty has come
[2:28:57] to see him saving Adam another was
[2:28:59] hiding in pig lips
[2:29:01] being just a church member I believe the
[2:29:03] message God sent us a prophet
[2:29:07] he was hiding on those but his life was
[2:29:09] not bringing anything that that did not
[2:29:12] death
[2:29:13] because Adam where are you for goodness
[2:29:15] sake where are you Adam he said God I'm
[2:29:17] scared
[2:29:18] where did you learn that from
[2:29:21] they said the woman you gave me blame
[2:29:23] the blame game started right away
[2:29:25] it's my wife that caused it I don't used
[2:29:27] to be angry you know I know you're so
[2:29:28] really angry you know I'm a patient man
[2:29:30] you know I'm very nice I'm very kind it
[2:29:33] is this bad wife that I married
[2:29:36] when you are giving that flower she was
[2:29:38] not bad
[2:29:41] when you when you were texting her 2 am
[2:29:43] in the morning she was not bad but now
[2:29:45] she's a nightmare to you
[2:29:48] that's what Adam said see is this bad is
[2:29:50] the woman you gave me
[2:29:52] say blame it on God it's the woman you
[2:29:54] gave me and God will go to the sister
[2:29:57] he says that won't cost it and she will
[2:29:59] blame it on some other person
[2:30:01] my husband didn't know what happened it
[2:30:03] was that brother that said this
[2:30:05] so he put it on brother serpent
[2:30:08] and brother serpent has nobody to blame
[2:30:10] me he took the blame right away
[2:30:13] the serpent had nobody to blame that's
[2:30:15] what the Bible said when when God said
[2:30:17] Adam said it is the woman and the woman
[2:30:19] said it is the serpent
[2:30:21] and God says servant because you have
[2:30:23] done this because you have wrecked this
[2:30:25] Fellowship
[2:30:26] now because they stopping God was not
[2:30:28] seeing himself in the serpent but God
[2:30:30] was seen himself in Adam Adam was
[2:30:32] Sinners I believe who invited this
[2:30:34] happened into this relationship
[2:30:38] who invited the serpent into this
[2:30:41] relationship
[2:30:44] oh man
[2:30:46] I just uh I just running out of time and
[2:30:49] I must obey time we will close the
[2:30:52] service
[2:30:53] even they have so much to lay out of my
[2:30:56] heart but I believe your relationship
[2:30:58] with God through whatever you have heard
[2:31:00] it it matters a whole lot
[2:31:05] huh
[2:31:09] what is the problem Adam where are you
[2:31:11] at he was hiding on that figure
[2:31:16] he made figures and covered himself
[2:31:21] but the Fig Leaf you can still see it
[2:31:22] through to his nakedness his anger was
[2:31:25] still coming out temper was he coming
[2:31:27] out he's all those fruits are from
[2:31:29] godliness we're destroying the ugly face
[2:31:32] but remember
[2:31:35] God has come down to see himself in his
[2:31:38] son his son wasn't in church
[2:31:40] freed
[2:31:43] where did that come from
[2:31:46] he's afraid
[2:31:48] now is even it's even bold enough to say
[2:31:51] it is a woman you gave me that that made
[2:31:53] this thing happen look at that
[2:31:56] he couldn't even take responsibility
[2:31:59] Adam almost looked like an American in
[2:32:01] that place
[2:32:03] yeah
[2:32:05] somebody is caught shooting and killing
[2:32:07] people in school and he's caught he he's
[2:32:09] not killed and when they catch him they
[2:32:11] will be giving him orange juice and
[2:32:12] giving hamburger I said we are
[2:32:14] investigating you like go and shoot
[2:32:16] people in Africa when they give you
[2:32:18] dirty slap on your face you will know
[2:32:20] where the Love Faces
[2:32:21] but they're giving him orange juice and
[2:32:23] they say it's my grandfather that
[2:32:24] assault me and my grandmother assault me
[2:32:27] and and and they said oh yeah he was
[2:32:29] assaulted when he was young
[2:32:31] and now people are beginning to feel
[2:32:33] entitled they can go into a place and
[2:32:35] kill people do what they like because
[2:32:37] they know that they're going to be
[2:32:38] giving presidential treatment
[2:32:43] yeah nobody nobody can be condemned
[2:32:46] unless it's tried but at least before
[2:32:48] your child you should go through some
[2:32:49] rigorous time so you understand that uh
[2:32:52] what they say this in Nigeria is
[2:32:58] khaki is not leather that's what they
[2:33:00] that's what they mean you go through
[2:33:02] some rigorous time
[2:33:05] and then you realize that it is not just
[2:33:07] as easy as it is
[2:33:09] but you see we're making it so easy so
[2:33:11] that's why it is reproducing itself
[2:33:13] every time every time you just want that
[2:33:15] guy shoot people and they they're giving
[2:33:16] a hamburger and they're talking to him
[2:33:18] why did you do that
[2:33:27] thank you
[2:33:29] don't cry don't cry you you don't cry
[2:33:31] don't cry we understand we understand we
[2:33:33] understand nothing
[2:33:35] when you take God away from man he
[2:33:38] becomes an animal
[2:33:43] and we are trying to pet this animal we
[2:33:46] are trying to pet this animal he's an
[2:33:48] animal the moment you leave him again he
[2:33:50] will create more Havoc than he has ever
[2:33:52] created because he's an animal right
[2:33:55] right
[2:33:57] yeah
[2:33:59] so we say in general history the
[2:34:01] disaster came something came between the
[2:34:03] mirror
[2:34:06] something came between the mirror and
[2:34:08] with that thing came God could no longer
[2:34:10] see himself in his song
[2:34:12] himself in his wife
[2:34:15] there was a disconnection
[2:34:17] right there and then and because they
[2:34:19] said this connection communication gap
[2:34:21] coexisted immediately between Adam and
[2:34:24] his wife they can no more communicate
[2:34:26] the way they used to communicate before
[2:34:29] at one time they could communicate but
[2:34:31] knowing me so that's thought but night
[2:34:33] is different
[2:34:34] now I just won't want to blame this one
[2:34:36] and that one want to blame that one
[2:34:38] everybody have blame in their mind I
[2:34:40] want to blame everybody for everything
[2:34:43] so then we drop into Genesis chapter 4.
[2:34:46] and when we drop into Genesis 4 chaos
[2:34:48] has already set in God can no more see
[2:34:51] himself in his son his son cannot see
[2:34:53] himself in the mirror so we already have
[2:34:56] chaos
[2:34:58] and in that Chaos two children were born
[2:35:03] kid on one hand an adult on the other
[2:35:06] hand
[2:35:07] and these two children they have one
[2:35:09] pastor
[2:35:10] Pastor Adam
[2:35:13] any priests every service day he tell
[2:35:16] them oh my prince after the service is
[2:35:18] over he tell them how they used to live
[2:35:21] in the place where God could see himself
[2:35:23] in Adam could see himself in in the
[2:35:26] woman and he said I can't even see
[2:35:27] myself in hand no more because she's if
[2:35:30] she's the mother of all living
[2:35:33] and not bought good and bad at one time
[2:35:35] I couldn't see myself enough but now she
[2:35:37] reflect Both Worlds she reflect both
[2:35:39] Good and Evil
[2:35:43] So Adam is not evil So Adam can't see
[2:35:46] himself no more in the woman God can see
[2:35:48] himself no more in Adam
[2:35:51] so God have to make a way right there
[2:35:53] and then God have to slay them
[2:35:56] to cover them up so God can look through
[2:35:59] the blood of that lamb to see Adam again
[2:36:04] so God has time went on he consistently
[2:36:07] provided a lamb so he can succeed
[2:36:10] through that land because retro red is
[2:36:12] white so God could look through that
[2:36:14] Bloody lamb and then he could see Adam
[2:36:17] but a view of Adam was not clear
[2:36:20] it's lost it
[2:36:23] Genesis chapter 4
[2:36:26] King and Abel they come into church
[2:36:28] every day they end the message of the
[2:36:30] hour there was a message of that hour
[2:36:32] then yes amen praise God and Adam said
[2:36:35] oh God drove us out because of our sin
[2:36:37] or one day we're going to go back
[2:36:42] and there's going to be a shed blood
[2:36:44] that will take us back
[2:36:47] and everybody heard that word blood a
[2:36:49] little bit warned and got himself a lamb
[2:36:52] and slayed the lamb and God looked
[2:36:55] through that land and saw a bear
[2:36:57] and Cain went and put Beauty
[2:37:00] spending time with Christmas tree
[2:37:02] Christmas flower and all those things
[2:37:03] and he did not even know the purpose of
[2:37:05] Christmas
[2:37:06] Santa Claus and Satan's claw and all the
[2:37:09] clothes all around you
[2:37:12] and what's the meaning of Christmas
[2:37:15] and Cain lost the meaning of worship
[2:37:17] both of them came to church that day but
[2:37:20] Cain came without the revelation
[2:37:22] it was sweet but that area he came so
[2:37:25] sweet my friend he was so sweet he was
[2:37:28] coming just like they sing in the
[2:37:29] Catholic church
[2:37:32] [Music]
[2:37:36] just so holy
[2:37:39] it's not a son that make you holy after
[2:37:41] your son God was here and you'll be
[2:37:43] raping boys and girls what a Madness
[2:37:48] a king was coming under that guys
[2:37:51] and when he was coming God could not see
[2:37:53] himself in him but he was coming to God
[2:37:54] but God couldn't see nothing again
[2:37:57] foreign
[2:37:59] is all human humanistic worship did not
[2:38:03] even Ascend anywhere
[2:38:05] that's why when you are here this
[2:38:06] morning

[2:38:13] to see himself in you don't put on

[2:38:31] and call God ask God for the change
[2:38:33] Come Just the Way You Are
[2:38:36] the musicians can come up

[2:38:42] close the service yeah

[2:38:47] Ghost we put in your heart
[2:38:51] show me your face
[2:38:53] that's my message this morning
[2:38:57] that's the gift that God can unwrap for
[2:38:59] you is God's own face
[2:39:03] hmm
[2:39:04] Moses didn't say God show me your face
[2:39:06] he said God show me your glory god said
[2:39:08] if you see my face
[2:39:10] why is God talking of face
[2:39:12] Moses said Show Me Your Glory but God
[2:39:15] said if you see my face
[2:39:17] the communication does not right
[2:39:20] Moses asking for Show Me Your Glory God
[2:39:22] say if you see my face you will die
[2:39:29] now the face that God was talking of I
[2:39:31] have to jump to the end of my message
[2:39:33] Father me I just have to
[2:39:36] God will arrange it in your heart the
[2:39:38] path that we escape
[2:39:42] God told me
[2:39:47] to almost 38 18. he says show me what

[2:39:52] we close it don't worry the chicken is
[2:39:54] not going to burn we're getting close to
[2:39:56] it amen
[2:39:59] the restaurant some of them they are

[2:40:01] you'll be all right
[2:40:03] we are in this together
[2:40:06] we're here to 20 one another
[2:40:09] and making sure that look good so God
[2:40:12] can see
[2:40:13] himself in US
[2:40:18] what did he say somebody read that
[2:40:20] Exodus
[2:40:22] 38 18.
[2:40:26] 32 18. 3 18 sorry
[2:40:30] yeah
[2:40:32] 33 18. sorry I think 10 3 18.
[2:40:46] the Feast of unleavened bread Exodus 33
[2:40:50] 18. yes
[2:40:54] we all right
[2:40:56] yeah don't worry all right and he said
[2:40:59] should be
[2:41:01] me the glory show me what
[2:41:04] what does 39 say
[2:41:08] 19 33 19. look at what he said on the
[2:41:11] board
[2:41:13] Moses just asked God something show me
[2:41:15] what
[2:41:17] it needs to show me your face he said
[2:41:19] Show Me Your Glory
[2:41:20] but what did God say listen to what God
[2:41:22] Said
[2:41:24] God said if you see my face and he said
[2:41:27] I will make all my goodness pass before
[2:41:28] thee but I will proclaim the name of the
[2:41:30] Lord before thee and I will I'll be
[2:41:33] gracious home I'll be gracious too I
[2:41:34] will show Mercy on whom I will show
[2:41:36] Mercy to I think a verse there before
[2:41:38] that should talk about
[2:41:40] if you see my face you you'll die yeah
[2:41:43] and he said thou cannot see my face for
[2:41:45] there's a normal see me and what a leaf
[2:41:49] now let's just hold it right there just
[2:41:51] leave it right there
[2:41:52] you cannot see my face for there is no
[2:41:55] man there shall no man see me and one
[2:41:58] live
[2:42:01] now there's a face of God that if you
[2:42:03] see you die
[2:42:06] Moses was asking for God's glory god is
[2:42:08] bringing something that Moses was not
[2:42:10] asking for my if you see my face he'll
[2:42:12] die no man will be able to see my face
[2:42:15] now you can see when Manoa the father of
[2:42:18] Samson and his mother when they saw God
[2:42:20] in form of an Angel what did they say he
[2:42:22] said we've seen God we're going to die
[2:42:25] that's where that teaching come from if
[2:42:27] you see God you die but manoha the
[2:42:30] father of Samson and the mother of
[2:42:31] Samson they saw God they didn't die
[2:42:33] which means the face that God was
[2:42:36] talking about was not the first they saw
[2:42:38] because God does not lie
[2:42:41] when you see God's first you will die
[2:42:43] but Samson's father and his mother saw
[2:42:46] God's face and they said we have seen
[2:42:48] God we're going to die but did they die
[2:42:49] no
[2:42:51] which means they didn't see that face
[2:42:53] that kills the man
[2:42:55] you're talking about Genesis 18 God came
[2:42:58] down with two angels did Abraham see him
[2:43:02] come on trust did Abraham say God in
[2:43:04] Genesis 18 yes
[2:43:06] when God came to Abraham was he walking
[2:43:08] like this Lord he came face to face did
[2:43:12] Abraham died no
[2:43:14] because the first God was talking of was
[2:43:16] not what Abraham saw
[2:43:20] [Music]
[2:43:27] everybody's afraid of that but God said
[2:43:29] if you see my face you will die my Noah
[2:43:32] and his wife said oh God we're gonna die
[2:43:34] we'll see in this place we'll see this
[2:43:36] says we're going to die they didn't die
[2:43:37] because the first that kills a man was
[2:43:40] not what they saw
[2:43:42] the face that kills a man was not what
[2:43:45] Abraham saw
[2:43:46] Joshua am I ready to go find that great
[2:43:49] fight
[2:43:50] and the angel of God God himself came
[2:43:53] down and just said are you for us or are
[2:43:55] you against us did Joshua see the person
[2:43:58] he was talking to did you see his face
[2:43:59] yes he saw but did he die no
[2:44:04] which means the face that Joshua saw
[2:44:07] it's not the face that make you die
[2:44:11] [Music]
[2:44:18] I'm closing
[2:44:22] [Music]
[2:44:24] time to your neighbor say God bless you
[2:44:31] but Abraham said that's the
[2:44:33] that's the greatest thing you can tell
[2:44:35] it man
[2:44:36] [Music]
[2:44:42] Catherine can you put uh John 1 18 on
[2:44:44] the boat on the wall
[2:44:49] just follow me
[2:44:52] God created you as his mirror
[2:44:55] he wants to see himself through you
[2:44:59] you are not involved in this business
[2:45:01] so your mind and what you want they may
[2:45:04] look great
[2:45:05] but it's not greater than what God wants
[2:45:07] to see you
[2:45:08] your plans your Visions your artillery
[2:45:12] is not greater than what God wants to
[2:45:13] see you
[2:45:16] God wants to see himself in you
[2:45:19] do you know how serious that is
[2:45:21] foreign
[2:45:22] you want to see yourself in your wife
[2:45:24] honey we're going to this concert I want
[2:45:27] to put on this skirt I want to dress
[2:45:28] like because there's a test in your in
[2:45:30] your heart you want you want to see
[2:45:34] God wants to see himself in you
[2:45:37] [Music]
[2:45:40] okay can we read this together slowly

[2:48:41] are you not to do without this rage
[2:48:44] anger behind us correctly but God knows
[2:48:46] what to do with it
[2:48:50] which is

[2:51:39] let me say this kind of music just stop
[2:51:41] for a while now open your eyes and look
[2:51:43] at me
[2:51:45] two weeks ago
[2:51:46] I was chatting with a minister
[2:51:50] this ministers in a minister of forum
[2:51:54] the last time I was flying down here
[2:51:57] he was rough with other minister they
[2:51:59] were he was feeling rough the way he
[2:52:01] uses his word
[2:52:02] I tell you what people use quotes rough
[2:52:05] and he was suspended from the Forum
[2:52:08] so while I was in the airport
[2:52:11] I saw that I was suspended I called the
[2:52:13] admin before and I said add him back on
[2:52:15] the forearm
[2:52:17] he say no just but I not behaving like a
[2:52:18] minister I said don't do that add him on
[2:52:20] the Forum
[2:52:22] because when it behaves or that we know
[2:52:23] what to pray for
[2:52:26] but when you ostracize him we're not
[2:52:28] praying for nobody no more this is not
[2:52:30] heaven the devil was in heaven what's
[2:52:32] that in heaven so you think a forum is
[2:52:34] going to be all Angels you're wrong let
[2:52:36] him be there let him Express himself so
[2:52:38] we can know how to pray for one another
[2:52:41] look Brazil is not an angel you're not
[2:52:44] see your name there this morning you are
[2:52:45] seeing the sinner saved by grace
[2:52:47] [Music]
[2:52:50] and let me say this this morning you
[2:52:52] must sing greasy Grace oh I'm saved by
[2:52:53] grace I cannot swim in sin God forbid
[2:52:55] that's not me
[2:52:57] I'm saved by grace and grace humble me
[2:52:59] to appreciate God by living a life what
[2:53:01] you have the gospel
[2:53:04] [Music]
[2:53:06] they added him back to the Forum I
[2:53:08] called him I said brother you have to
[2:53:09] wash your words
[2:53:11] your words are too rough we're
[2:53:13] Christians where did the Holy Ghost go
[2:53:15] to all this quote fighting all this war
[2:53:18] just brother we're Christians but
[2:53:20] Abraham said we may not say eye to eye
[2:53:21] but we must say Heart to Heart
[2:53:24] I say heart to heart lead to eye to eye
[2:53:27] most of the time you already say Your
[2:53:28] Mind Brian is bringing false Doctrine
[2:53:30] your mind's already corrupt
[2:53:33] just relax your mind you're not God
[2:53:35] relax your mind
[2:53:37] but a brand the greatest Miracle they
[2:53:39] will say about Abraham is that you don't
[2:53:40] know who is his enemy because you love
[2:53:42] everybody the same
[2:53:43] [Music]
[2:53:46] and I got talking to this Minister I
[2:53:47] talked to him again another time
[2:53:49] and it was still too rough
