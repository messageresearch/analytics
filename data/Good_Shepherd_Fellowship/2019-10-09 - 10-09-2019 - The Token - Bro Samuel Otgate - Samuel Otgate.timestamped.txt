[48:56] thank you loving master house it covered
[48:59] only things to you believing every day
[49:02] granted to us
[49:03] in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen
[49:09] I guess won't read from the book of
[49:10] Exodus chapter 12 and as I said we may
[49:15] not take long I mean I have many of
[49:20] course that I may not quote all I may
[49:23] put some the way this people lead us
[49:27] amen amen
[49:33] Exodus chapter 12 from was stroll
[49:49] he says so I will pass through the land
[49:57] of Egypt this night and will smite all
[50:01] the firstborn in the land of Egypt both
[50:05] man and beast and all I mean and again
[50:11] as all the gods of Egypt I'll extrude
[50:15] judgment I am the Lord and the blood
[50:19] shall be to you for a token upon the
[50:22] houses we are we are and when I see the
[50:26] Blood I will pass over you and the
[50:29] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[50:34] you
[50:34] when I smite the land of Egypt and also
[50:41] you can have the book of Hebrews chapter
[50:47] 9 I'm shocked at another chapter 10 of
[50:56] Hebrews and from verse 19 a man having
[51:06] therefore brethren boldness to enter in
[51:10] the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a
[51:15] new and living way which he has
[51:19] consecrated for us through the veil that
[51:24] is to say in flesh in having an High
[51:28] Priest on the house of God let us draw
[51:32] near with a true heart in full assurance
[51:36] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[51:40] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[51:45] washed with pure water let us hold fast
[51:50] the profession of our faith without
[51:52] wavering for he is faithful that
[51:56] promised and let us consider one another
[52:00] to provoke unto love and to good works
[52:06] maybe Caribbean five also not forsaking
[52:10] the assembling of ourselves together as
[52:13] the manner of some is but exhorting one
[52:18] another and so much the more as you see
[52:23] the Day approaching may the Lord bless
[52:27] earning of his one we can just be seated
[52:31] for a while amen
[52:36] I just want to speak on something small
[52:40] and call it when I see the blood I'll
[52:45] pass over you the Prophet preached evita
[52:50] same day talking when he said we have to
[52:56] apply the token and then he said some
[53:00] we're not talking could not be applied
[53:04] but it was to be applied only in the
[53:08] evening time amen
[53:11] and we know we are now in the evening
[53:14] time when the token is to be applied
[53:18] amen and then when you talk when you
[53:22] talk about a token we are talking about
[53:25] the blood amen because the blood was
[53:31] applied in the evening time in the time
[53:35] of Moses he also we have read in the
[53:40] Bible the book of Exodus the blood was
[53:44] applied in the evening time amen amen
[53:51] so in the Old Testament we find that the
[53:59] blood was a sign of a Convenant or
[54:04] agreement between man and God amen so
[54:12] whenever there was anything that
[54:14] God wanted to agree with you man he had
[54:19] to use blood amen
[54:22] maybe if we read the book of Exodus let
[54:25] us really a book of Exodus chapter 20
[54:27] for excellence trained for so it was a
[54:41] covenant anything that God wanted to do
[54:45] with man wanted to agree with man he
[54:49] wanted to save man wanted to deliver man
[54:54] anything it was blood
[54:59] amen 24 verse 6 he says here and Moses
[55:10] took half of the blood and put it in
[55:14] bathrooms and half of the blood is
[55:17] sprinkled on the altar and he took the
[55:21] book of the Covenant and read in the in
[55:25] the audience of the people and they said
[55:29] all that the Lord has said when we do
[55:35] and be obedient they were making
[55:40] agreement amen
[55:43] and Moses took the blood and sprinkled
[55:47] it on the people and said behold the
[55:51] blood of the covenant with the Lord has
[55:55] made with you concerning all these words
[56:01] amen so we're making a covenant with God
[56:08] that all that was written all that God
[56:14] spoke all that God wouldn't be done they
[56:19] were going to do it and they were going
[56:22] to obey
[56:23] amen and then Moses gets the blood to
[56:29] make a covenant between the people under
[56:34] God amen say this is a covenant that
[56:39] you've made today with your God that
[56:44] you're going to obey everything that you
[56:48] say
[56:50] amen so the blood was always a comment
[56:56] it was something that God was agreeing
[56:59] with the people binding himself with the
[57:03] people amen and when we see in the book
[57:10] of Genesis amen when Adam fell God came
[57:17] down from heaven amen and he looked for
[57:23] a lamp and he got the blood of the Lamb
[57:28] and sprinkle it over Adam and Eve in a
[57:36] right so everything it was blood blood
[57:42] blood
[57:43] amen so after sprinkle the blood over
[57:47] Adam and Eve that's when God again could
[57:52] have fellowship with Adam amen
[57:56] when Adam sinned he separated himself
[57:59] from God and there was no way God could
[58:03] have fellowship with Adam a game he had
[58:06] to take the blood
[58:08] sprinkle over them man agreement with
[58:12] them hallelujah amen so that's why in
[58:22] the Old Testament you find out
[58:25] everything it was blood amen
[58:34] so blood was to be applied on the
[58:38] sanctuary a man it was to be applied on
[58:43] the altar
[58:44] Brad was job applied in the Holy of
[58:47] Holies everywhere
[58:50] the blood was always being applied when
[58:55] the Wasco to come a man to worship
[58:59] before he enters is in a place of
[59:03] worship they were to sprinkle the blood
[59:06] over him amen
[59:10] so that was just the shadows of the
[59:14] things to come that even in me and you
[59:19] today before we come amen
[59:23] to be in real real fellowship with God
[59:29] amen there must be the shedding of the
[59:33] blood and we must be sprinkled with the
[59:37] blood and then the life of that blood
[59:41] must come upon us because the Bible says
[59:45] that time when they see no to come with
[59:50] alarm amen
[59:53] to sacrifice it he would bring it the
[59:58] priest and then he lay his hands on the
[1:00:03] RAM and then when he lays his hands on
[1:00:07] the lamp and when they are slaughtering
[1:00:10] of lamb you will feel that it is him
[1:00:14] will be dying amen
[1:00:19] the life of the lamp that was growing
[1:00:24] out of that lamp would be the life of
[1:00:27] the sinner and now when the blood of
[1:00:32] that lamb would sprinkle over the
[1:00:34] worshiper then the washbowl feel that is
[1:00:40] free from that death amen
[1:00:47] to feel no I am free I would have been
[1:00:50] the one to die but the love has died for
[1:00:55] my state amen
[1:00:58] as long as that blood that one blood
[1:01:02] would sprinkle over him then who will
[1:01:05] feel oh now I am free praise God
[1:01:11] but the blood of the animals could not
[1:01:16] come upon the worshiper and the premises
[1:01:20] that worshiper who do go back with the
[1:01:25] same guilt I'm going to go back to do
[1:01:29] their some things that he beat why
[1:01:33] because the life of the animal will not
[1:01:37] come back to the wash pot but it's our
[1:01:41] Lord Jesus came as a Lamb of God and
[1:01:48] down there in Jordan John the Baptist
[1:01:52] pointed people and say there is a lot of
[1:01:56] God who takes away the sins of the world
[1:01:58] Oh when the Pharisees was in looking at
[1:02:02] the lamp the animal lab there came a
[1:02:08] Lamb of God amen the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:14] with the blood of God himself
[1:02:19] amen so that when that blood hallelujah
[1:02:25] is wrinkle upon the wash path then the
[1:02:30] life that is in that blood must come
[1:02:33] upon the believer amen
[1:02:37] when we become one with our sacrifice
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:48] let me with something here the provinces
[1:02:51] something here
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:55] so their blood that was in alarm
[1:03:01] in the animal life could not come back
[1:03:06] to the worshiper because it was animal
[1:03:09] life amen
[1:03:13] but now the love of God Jesus Christ
[1:03:17] Himself came and died anybody's blood
[1:03:23] for us for you and me amen now their
[1:03:29] life that was in that blood must come
[1:03:34] upon the worshiper because he's no
[1:03:39] longer the blood of an animal is the
[1:03:42] blood of God amen and when the blood of
[1:03:47] God comes upon the worshiper then the
[1:03:51] blood of the worshiper is done away with
[1:03:54] if the blood of God comes down in your
[1:03:58] life in my life and we no longer live
[1:04:02] our own life we now live the life of the
[1:04:05] blood of God in us amen
[1:04:13] the promises he and the message showed
[1:04:16] the father
[1:04:17] it is suffice us he says God looking
[1:04:21] down out of heaven saying that is what
[1:04:24] it affects the blood amen it attacks the
[1:04:31] blood speaking what did you speak of yes
[1:04:36] after that the Lamb of God was led away
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:42] you are the blood of your father and
[1:04:45] mother but being born again you become
[1:04:50] the blood of God the blood of Christ
[1:04:55] pleasing us amen amen
[1:05:01] so now the life that was in the blood of
[1:05:06] Jesus Christ comes upon the believers
[1:05:11] they worship ah
[1:05:14] me and you amen and then we become the
[1:05:21] blood of our Father that is what makes
[1:05:25] us be sons and daughters of God again
[1:05:30] not by coming to church no amen but by
[1:05:36] that blood coming in us and then when
[1:05:41] that blood comes in us then we have the
[1:05:45] blood of our Father hallelujah and then
[1:05:51] we have the blood of our Father then the
[1:05:54] life of the Father will be in us and
[1:05:59] every child will have the character of
[1:06:03] the blood of their father
[1:06:06] praise God I believe that's why Jesus
[1:06:11] when he looked at the policies he looked
[1:06:14] at their character he looked on their
[1:06:16] behavior he looked at what way do they
[1:06:19] were being he looked at it and said no
[1:06:22] the problem is the blood in you and
[1:06:29] they're wondering I said no we think
[1:06:32] from God is our Father
[1:06:34] he said no if God was your father you
[1:06:38] would do the works of your father but
[1:06:43] the blood in you is not of God and they
[1:06:47] say no our Father is God our fathers
[1:06:50] Abraham
[1:06:50] he said if I promised your father you
[1:06:53] would do what abrupted why because every
[1:06:58] child will manifest the character of the
[1:07:01] blood of his father amen praise God they
[1:07:10] say your father is the devil and is what
[1:07:15] you do he was a mother from the
[1:07:18] beginning that's what you are picking
[1:07:20] stones to restore me because you're
[1:07:23] manifesting the character of the blood
[1:07:26] of your father
[1:07:29] amen so if the blood of the father
[1:07:33] bringing us please God don't ever the
[1:07:40] Sun and every dot of God willing
[1:07:43] manifest the character of the blood of
[1:07:46] the Father because you can't manifest
[1:07:51] any other thing praise God
[1:07:55] you can't manifest in other life amen
[1:08:00] in the Wright brothers and that's why we
[1:08:05] find out Abel because were the son of
[1:08:07] God
[1:08:08] he came to manifest the character of the
[1:08:11] Father amen
[1:08:15] when when Abel came looking for the RAM
[1:08:18] and slaying the lamb he was only
[1:08:21] manifesting their character of the
[1:08:23] father the Bible says God had already
[1:08:27] slain the lamb before the foundation of
[1:08:29] the world
[1:08:31] amen even when I haven't even seen God
[1:08:36] again came looking for the love and his
[1:08:39] rule alone and now that blood was
[1:08:42] already in there was no way you could
[1:08:46] manifest another character praise God
[1:08:51] praise God hallelujah look at Abraham he
[1:09:00] went he goes together I'm saying this is
[1:09:03] my sister and when Isaac goes together
[1:09:07] he also says this is my sister you mean
[1:09:12] to tell me that a promise of told Isaac
[1:09:15] that when you go there you tell that the
[1:09:18] king that this is your sister no Isaac
[1:09:23] was only manifesting the character of
[1:09:26] the blood of his father whoa praise
[1:09:31] minimal or do you believe that that if
[1:09:37] you are here today you are here to
[1:09:41] manifest
[1:09:42] the character of the blood of your
[1:09:44] father
[1:09:47] amen praise God because life is in the
[1:09:54] blood and that life in the blood was to
[1:09:58] come back to the worshiper amen and Rob
[1:10:02] Rob says I think in a seal of God I
[1:10:06] don't remember
[1:10:07] amen maybe the conceded he says when a
[1:10:12] believer a man who lays hands on the
[1:10:19] Lord Jesus Christ and if you the pain of
[1:10:23] Calvary hallelujah amen

[1:10:33] was none other than God himself and when
[1:10:39] that cell comes to you as a worshiper
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:45] then your spirit is blended out and the
[1:10:49] Spirit of God comes in you and that
[1:10:53] makes you a son and a daughter of God
[1:10:56] and then you start fellowshipping with
[1:11:01] God you are fauna
[1:11:03] praise God there is no way we can
[1:11:06] fellowship with God until 30 blood comes
[1:11:10] in you amen

[1:11:16] member praise God
[1:11:19] a church goer oh praise be to the Lord

[1:12:51] should have been me but the lamb is
[1:12:55] taking my place but that man went back
[1:13:00] out to the same desire in his heart to
[1:13:05] see that he ever had because the life
[1:13:11] that was in the blood of the lamb was an
[1:13:14] animal life and the animal life animal
[1:13:20] on Spirit could come back and blend with
[1:13:23] a human spirit for money is an animal
[1:13:26] and the other is a human praise God
[1:13:31] otherwise we'll be acting like animals
[1:13:36] but if you took the blood of God himself
[1:13:40] but when Jesus died at Calvary and they
[1:13:45] worship ever comes to Calvary by faith

[1:20:23] beginning no end that's what we are by
[1:20:28] resuming the life of God hallelujah amen
[1:20:36] because you're a part of him because he
[1:20:40] becomes a son and a bit of God and
[1:20:43] you're displaying his word he says Oh

[1:50:17] your blood now your life when he see his
[1:50:21] blood praise the Lord the emphasis is
[1:50:27] now on the worshiper the emphasis is on
[1:50:31] the sacrifice praise the Lord
[1:50:36] amen there's nothing we can do to change
[1:50:41] ourselves the problem is that we've been
[1:50:45] making effort will be making effort and
[1:50:48] not be making enough effort on our
[1:50:52] sacrifice we have to make enough effort
[1:50:58] to identify ourselves with our sacrifice
[1:51:01] to believe our sacrifice to believe the
[1:51:04] work that was done in our place instead
[1:51:07] of trying to do the work we struggle to
[1:51:12] do the work instead of accepting what
[1:51:14] has already been done when I see the
[1:51:20] blood now your blood it's his blood when
[1:51:28] he see the life now your life he don't
[1:51:30] want you know our life will never be
[1:51:33] accepted it's just a filthy wreck the
[1:51:37] emphasis is not on the worshiper it has
[1:51:40] to come by revelation the emphasis is
[1:51:44] not on the worshiper the emphasis is not
[1:51:48] on the preacher the emphasis is not on
[1:51:51] the profit brother Branham the emphasis
[1:51:54] is on the sacrifice
[1:51:59] praise the Lord
[1:52:01] you can never be greater than your
[1:52:03] sacrifice it has to come a revelation we
[1:52:10] have to remind ourselves constantly Lord
[1:52:14] it is not me it's the sacrifice I need
[1:52:18] to believe the sacrifice I need to
[1:52:21] believe what was done in my place it's a
[1:52:26] simple but yet it is hard because God
[1:52:32] has to read a it to the to the to the
[1:52:35] worshiper that the emphasis is not the
[1:52:38] worshiper the high priest does not
[1:52:41] examine the worshiper the high priest
[1:52:44] examine the sacrifice the worshiper is
[1:52:49] not honor examination we have to remind
[1:52:54] ourselves that he's now looking at me
[1:52:58] he's now looking at you he's looking at
[1:53:02] the sacrifice and we must look at the
[1:53:05] sacrifice we must worship the sacrifice
[1:53:07] we must brace the sacrifice God were for
[1:53:16] this age what God has allotted for this
[1:53:18] age because is the age of the
[1:53:21] manifestation of the sons of God it's a
[1:53:25] kind of a high requirement I mean it's a
[1:53:31] kind of a higher requirement and what
[1:53:33] happened is that we try to struggle with
[1:53:37] our in ourselves to meet that
[1:53:39] requirement
[1:53:42] praise the Lord but he had made the
[1:53:46] requirement has already make a provision
[1:53:51] because his work and not go out and
[1:53:54] return back vow if he says he will have
[1:53:57] manifestation of the sons of God it will
[1:54:00] not be mean that will produce it it will
[1:54:03] not be you that will produce it it will
[1:54:05] be him so we have to keep believing him
[1:54:09] for it the emphasis is not on the
[1:54:17] worshiper the emphasis is on the
[1:54:20] sacrifice are we together tonight when I
[1:54:27] see the Blood I will pass over you
[1:54:33] price of the one they love bless you
[1:54:36] tonight a few couple of weeks ago we
[1:54:38] were talking on when we were speaking on
[1:54:42] the bounding power we make I make
[1:54:45] reference to this little poster here
[1:54:48] from the Welsh revival where we spoke
[1:54:52] about the for inspiration that inspired
[1:54:58] the wish revival and I promised I was
[1:55:01] going to make a postcard of it so you
[1:55:03] can pick up one and if you want it and I
[1:55:09] would just I would just encourage you to
[1:55:11] pick it up just put it in your Bible and
[1:55:14] just look at it you don't have to
[1:55:16] worship it you don't have to make a
[1:55:19] recitation just it might just encourage
[1:55:23] you praise the Lord
[1:55:26] amen the reason I'm saying this is
[1:55:29] because we have overburden ourselves we
[1:55:34] have given ourselves too much
[1:55:36] expectation not following God sitting in
[1:55:39] tonight in our life before this end of
[1:55:46] this week are we get the Holy Ghost that
[1:55:48] you can give the Holy Ghost and and we
[1:55:53] put ourself on Erdos burden and and
[1:55:56] remember like brother Branham said if
[1:55:59] you put your hands to what God is doing
[1:56:01] God will back up if you put your hands
[1:56:07] there because it's not going to be the
[1:56:10] work of a man we have to believe in his
[1:56:13] promised word this is the time where we
[1:56:15] have to believe God's words more than
[1:56:17] ever
[1:56:18] take God's word for what he says now
[1:56:21] what brother Wang says what God said in
[1:56:25] his word

[1:56:33] gonna give you I was gonna bring it out
[1:56:36] and give it to you praise the Lord
