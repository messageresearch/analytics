amen you can never be the same praise the lord [Music] you may be seated [Music] and he's running out the door yes i was here a couple years ago anyways but i'm gonna make my wife stand up because the last church i was at they said i had to introduce my better half so behind all of us frail men are good women [Music] so she keeps me in line praise the lord we we live in michigan we've been serving the lord since 1976 so tomorrow my wife and i will be married 46 years there was a young couple that well there were young people you know that's where you start as young people and they were both very faithful they followed the lord you know with all their hearts and they met and they came together they felt they were in love so they went to the priest and and they got married you know and so they were serving the lord and they were faithful and you know when you're a young married couple then you like to have some children so they prayed and children didn't come right away but they still prayed and they were still faithful and then one day the wife she went to the husband and she said i'm with child and so they rejoiced and the church rejoiced everybody was happy you know it's a wonderful thing and when the child was born then they were happy that a son had come into the world and and they they took care of him like you would for a newborn baby and everything else but they noticed there was something peculiar about this child and as time went on they realized that the baby was blind and you know how why would god even do something like that to a young couple you know that love one another and and they want to be good parents and everything else but their child was blind so they gave that child all the love and they raised him up and one day he come to you know he come he he served the lord he he gave his heart to the lord and and but he was still blind you know and then he grew up and and one day his parents sat down and they told him they said well son you you have to make a way for yourself in this world you you have to do this and he said well what what can i do i'm blind and they said well we'll we'll take you down and we'll find you a place there's a place at the by the city gate there's a place where you can sit and and the people that are more affluent that have good things and that's what isn't jehovah good to me and yes he is he's he's given you a good life but now you have to make a way and and just so they found a place for him to sit by the city gate and and he sat there and and people that had money and that they would you know give him a little offering in that so he could buy himself some food or some clothes and and but he was still faithful he still was faithful one day a great man came by he came by with his disciples and his disciples his disciples they looked at him and they said master oh sinned was it because the parents were bad parents was it because their grandparents were bad people that this man was born blind and jesus looked at them and he said no brothers no this man was born blind that the works of god might be made manifest in him praise god amen [Applause] and he set his disciples aside and he did the most awful thing awful things fit on the ground i mean would you like me to spin in her face brother really spin on the ground he made himself some little clay eyes and he put him in there hallelujah and he said and now you go to the pool shalom and and wash your eyes and you will see whoever heard anything so crazy i spit in your eyes and i'm gonna say now you're gonna see that blind man he had never seen he had never heard jesus he didn't know who jesus was but he had to believe what jesus said that's right [Applause] what if peter said oh no you spit in my eyes [Applause] but he got up and he went down and he went down there and he washed his eyes out and his eyes come open sometimes you think the things that you pray and you look at your life and you say oh i've done all the right things why is god doing this to me but maybe god wants to use you to manifest his word in this hour in the most wicked i love i love that god god knows the age to have you born in you are in the last lap now if you've ever watched the olympics they saved the best runners for the last lap that's right and you say oh my i can't do this yeah yes you can yeah my heavenly father placed you right here this hour this time not that you would be a failure but the word of god would become your testimony amen amen amen praise the lord for the trials praise the lord for the spirit praise the lord that god is still keeping his word amen amen oh my goodness praise the lord oh my goodness amen was that not church just that we had can we buy our hair's prayed and go home we just had church amen praise

praying for young joshua amen and uh just before we go to the lord in prayer a couple of months we sat with the officers and and we fed the need of having one of the other brothers to step in and help with the trustee board over the years brother steve cassidy has uh uh still serve as a trustee and a treasurer and which of course he's been doing an amazing job and uh but uh we thought that we will have uh uh brother jordan since he's he's uh also serving as one of the church administrators to get on the trusty board praise the lord so we will have brother jordan to come up and let let the congregation in me people if you don't know brother jordan you you have not been to this church praise the lord amen and as our minor of life is by the word of god it is not only by personal preference but it should be by the word of god so i will ask this body of congregation as we bow with his if there is anyone that self in this church that is a member of this church that support this church with their ties and offerings that have anything any reservation for brother jordan to serve as a trustee may you just do there by the raising up of your hands if you do not want blood jordan to be a trustee if you have a reason why you think he's now qualified to be a trustee you can do there by the raising up of your hands [Music] heavenly father is very good to be in the house of the lord this morning dear lord what on what an introduction to your word father lord and uh we want to thank you for putting that inspiration on brother bruce heart lord when he started talking about a young man and a young woman that got married and trusting the law for the child father lord a way that your word can become emotional and the way your word can address us and the way your word can speak to us and then talking about a child that was born with a deformity dear lord god that's the way they capture us lord and father we were drawn into the same potato of the story and oh god father but there was a glorious end their god and and just in few minutes lord when when we knew that he was talking about a bible character when oh god the holy spirit pick up our mind and realize who god is something that we have read in the bible the windows of our hearts starts to open lord and the people laws start identifying themselves in that in that verse of scripture oh god come lord jesus you said lord father that oh god if we can see we might ask of you lord of god we must buy of you and you will give us ourselves lord and open our eyes it's a promise for this age oh lord allow this your church age dear god we just want to thank you we want to thank you for a word we want to thank you for the message we want to thank you o god father for a promise that became flesh and stood in our obey that was identified with our scripture lord and oh god we can say lord father you have given us ourselves so father and may you open the eyes of our heart open the eyes of our mind oh god that we

yes he began [Music] he [Music] he took my place [Music] grace [Music] hallelujah praise the lord the lord bless you thank you musicians uh uh that will be it for now maybe after the preaching of the world we can water the world with praise and uh let's take first king chapter 18 praise the lord and once again we will say uh thank the lord to for the the petersons on the faith money or wedding anniversary and we pray that the lord will will bless them praise the lord amen for he is good first king chapter 18 first king chapter 18 we started speaking wednesday night on the harmony of the father and son something brother branham referenced in the church-ish book which of course he says such harmony that uh existed between the father and the son would be the scene between the bride and the groom and uh so we we want to continue in that thought but i have an inspiration that i will i will want to endured on my father my father the chair of israel and the houseman there of praise the lord amen and so first king chapter 18 verse 41 and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain amen are you hearing the sound of abundance of rain praise the lord amen the windows of heaven are open his blessings are falling so ahab went up to eat and drink and elijah went up to the top of of camel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees and said to his seven go up now look towards the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there rise a cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say unto aha prepared that chariot and get thee down that the rain stopped being net and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and a half rolled and went to israel and the hand of the lord now listen to this now the hand of the lord was only larger and he gave up his land and ran before ahab told the entrance of jezreel ahab is on the chariot but yet elijah have more speed than ahab elijah is running ahab is on the chariot but elijah gets to the gate before ahab praise the lord amen second king chapter 2 verse 12. second king chapter 2 verse 12. praise the lord second king chapter 2 verse 12. verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on that's elijah and elijah and talk and behold there appeared a cherry of fire in the nurses of fire and potted them both as sunder it might have just ran between them and elijah went up by a whale went into heaven and elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of ezra and the horsemen thereof and he saw him normal and he took hold of his own cloth and ran them in two pieces father your blessed word has been read and this morning we just want to trust you that something of internal value will be said lord there are a lot of things that could be said that would take out our mind father in an intellectual way but that thing of internal value that's what our soul will feed on speak to us out of your word this morning in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seat if uh brother ben i mean brother dan would just come and help me [Music] praise the lord and we just uh we just uh want to thank the lord uh now i want you to notice something just just take this back there before you disturb us this morning and uh wednesday night when we were speaking about uh uh uh david lamettin over the death of jonathan and saul the bible says uh he rented his clothes and if you realize here also elisha did the same thing amen amen he did the same thing he rented his clothes if we were back up a little bit and what we were trying to show wednesday night you know out of the word is that uh we were talking on the the harmony between the father and the son and we were trying to look at the relationship that existed between david and saul and if it was not because of david lament we would never be able to have a grains into some of the positive things that saul did praise the lord because uh the the bible in first samuel just told us a little bit of of what he did and and from the from the singing of the ladies we we heard that he killed a thousand and and and uh and dedicate ten thousand whether they made that up or you know uh or they just said it for the fact that david destroyed uh uh goliath in the in the army of the the uh philistines ran away but we whichever way is that that was just a little insight that they saw has some victory but when we came down to to david lamenting over the death of saul we realized that david expressed all daughters of jerusalem amen don't let it be heard he said because this man ministry clothed you he clothed you yes right amen praise the lord amen amen he said how sword and journeytown was very pleasing in their lives yes they were very pleasant we we we turned to see all the negative things because we are so easy to give that way that's our fallen nature we can't help it we can help it it's so easy for us to gear into seeing the negative thing and if god does not help are we only stuck in the negative things and we don't see nothing good about that person he said david and saul were very pleasant in their life david stayed i mean so in journalism david stayed in the house of saul amen they never kept him in the band he was in the royal palace he had this he ate at the king's table they had a relationship as father and son and that's the reason why when david cut off his garment and went on the hill and says see i have your gun he said my son he felt it in his heart he said my son that was a relationship that was between them and what he also said and also identified is that both of them there were in their life david said they were swift like eagles strong like lion and that is true identity of the living creatures around the throne so in the allies they have the alpha and the omega anointing because that's what it takes for god to lead his people god will call a man and back the man up with one of those anointing so every god gave him man whether it was jeremiah whether it was down here every one of them will honor one of those anointing because it's not the man that does the work is the anointing that does the work [Music] are we together so yeah yeah yeah the uh uh uh david giving us an insight but realized that it took a lamentation that's what happened when a cry comes from the soul you ought of things you offer things that become pleasing to god all right it's not a crowd where you want for everybody to hear what you what you're going through oh my god i know i'm dying my people are dying i'm dying you are not there you are not dead yet amen but if you look through the scripture you will realize it was it it was something it was it's a it's a pattern of god verb says those hebrew mothers in in childbirth when when when they when when they are travailing to bring forth they cry the strength to god and then they they say words beyond their imagination praise the lord so also you will see it here in in in the scripture that whenever uh uh uh uh a prophet or or a man or you know uh uh just like we're looking at year and when when when he's lamented after there are things that i said that identify the ministry of the man that's one we want to look at this morning when when elijah said my father my father the chariot of israel what was he saying what was he saying was he referring to the the the chair that took elisha out no i don't believe so i don't believe so praise the lord i don't believe so i believe elijah was so affected by the ministry of elijah there were things that he saw there were things that he saw he was right there on my camel when he saw fire coming down from heaven amen he was the one that saw the the the cloud like a man's hand when the whole heavens was was just like a brass by elijah telling him go i see abundance of rain he went he still saw the brazing cloud he came back and said nothing says go back again do it seven times boy and as as you know as he was doing it he could see the changes he was paying attention he was not he was not just confirming himself but he was paying attention because he knows his father has spoken praise the lord he know that his father has spoken which of course it was not his literal father but he have come under the ministry of this man that he became a son to elijah by the order of the ministry are we together [Music] praise the lord my father my father the chariot of israel and the husband thereof now so we realize here as we will look into this this morning believing that the lord that have always been our help he will help us this morning praise the lord well thank you uh brother ben and sister alice for having us yesterday and uh we just appreciate the time of fellowship amen praise the lord hallelujah now as we look at this together you realize the other if you look at this aspect of elijah referring to elijah as father it holds a natural disposition for the nature the road of a father praise the lord elijah was acknowledging the great save guy of elijah the elijah being in israel elijah as as the man of god the prophet of god right there he was acknowledging a safe guard that by this man because we have to realize that it was a period of time where the uh how they caught it now a period of time where uh jesse bear religion has taken over the land yes amen amen amen and to see a man on the scene that was calling the people back to jehovah calling the people back to the lord god of israel and he said lord i have done all of these things are calling to your word yes let the fire fall amen praise the lord so eli elisha have identified safety that was in the prophet are we together now the reason why i read those two verses or out of those two chapter first king and second king was to be able to give you a little bit of an idea and uh elijah or elastic with what he saw that a man who i run chariot now you have to realize that ahab terror was just like it was the president motoke amen the one of the united states they call it the beast yes praise the lord amen they give him the finest cherub the best protected is is you have uh uh uh the best speed above every other chariot because it's used for safety to get him out when there is trouble the lord that's the reason why when the children of israel saw a pharaoh cherub behind him they just thought they were dead they knew that they were out they would those those hearses and cheryl would just run over them amen because this is just not an honor this is the president this is the king and when is the king his his chariot is not going to be behind no he had to lead right he have two men by his side and he's the one leading nobody can overrun him right amen so they the children of israel clearly saw that this was pharaoh coming after them amen trying to create a picture here in your mind so with ahab getting on his chair and elijah saying ron reign is coming praise the lord and ahab took up and started let's go gentlemen the president motorcade get on the road everybody clear the road if you stand before it they just hit you and go no investigation the president motorcade does not stop for you to cross the road you feel like his life is more important than any other life that's the reason why they will block every street because they don't want no interference they are not going to stop right amen i mean i uh uh ahab drum out of his house shadow his man they are running because they can all see the clouds praise the lord amen elijah get up it's a boy i'll see you come and meet me in jezreel praise the lord oh boy headed prophet how much can he run praise the lord before aha realized he said i see you come and meet me i'm trying to give you a picture of the speed on a which god work the way he changed a sinner to sin [Music] the way he takes habit out of our life is more than the time that the surgeon will operate to take tumor from your body praise the lord the way god can turn things around he does not operate in the same speed that we do amen no he does not are we together praise the lord so i i just want us to to picture that in our mind because that's what we want to do here this this morning because most of the time we think that you know we we know one another we come here to church we know what i know what is happening down there people say that i know what that church is offer you don't have no idea [Music] you don't have no idea oh nothing is happening down there oh no nothing just bunch of hypocrites you are the hypocrite because god do not work in our time domain and god do not move by our speed limit in a car the way god move and work it's different amen praise the lord so i just want us to be in that mindset this morning because that's where we're going to travel as we as we talk about this uh uh father and son you see that's why jesus said the song could do nothing except what the father show him because when the father have shown him it's already done the son does not have to worry it's already done he can step on the scene and say thou said the lord it's going to happen [Applause] because he's working on the father's time for for the resurrection of lazarus it was on the father's time praise the lord three days four days was no time to god because one day to god is a thousand years our fallen nature have the tendency of making us impatient impatient church has turned to casino people want to put a dime and cash in the million amen praise the lord and we take we take god out of the picture nor trust in god are we together i see the cloud like a man's hand and i know it is going to rain praise the lord are we together there is there is this there is this principle there is just principle over in deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 30. let's let's uh okay i have it right open here how she won't chase a thousand in two port ten thousand to flight amen after we left ben house yesterday everybody's stomach fault the food digesting the blood start running in my head feeling like i want to sleep i drove over to the church here and then uh just asking god for mercy lord please have mercy on me i eat too much oh don't help me what would i say to your people master my phone but the lord was gracious amen he was gracious he was gracious amen we had a wonderful time looking into the word of the lord and uh yeah yeah so i got home a little bit late this morning but we thank the lord for that so when you look at this principle i was looking at this principle a little bit last night and it is known that uh a drafthurst in its own it can pull up to 8 000 pounds praise the lord it's almost like pulling a summer truck you know a lot of these big trucks and he says however when two draft horses work together they can move up to 24 000 pounds and then if they are trained to work together they can move up to 32. it's a lord that is in nature it's an unwritten lord it's an unwritten lord you don't have to go to bible school to learn it that's right you don't have to you know finish master degree to it's unwritten law if two can agree on anything amen it's honorating lord praise the lord now so with with this thought in mind it takes us back to illusion lamentation what was he crying about because he realized how the ministry of elijah was pulling israel out of idolatry amen the ministry of elijah was the powerhouse it was pulling in another world he was saying oh my father you are the terror of israel if we have a horseman it's not a hot terrace it's not ahab ahmed you are the army of is because just by a vision he sat in his house and gave instruction to the army of israel how to fight their battles and the king said it looks like there is somebody here that is on reconnaissance somebody is telling somebody say no no king no that's a prophet he sits in his bare chamber and he knows what is happening amen amen god praise the lord lord israel age has make a mess out of the ministry we have a whole lot of uh uh untrained people and prosperity gospel and and and it's almost like jacob coming down to egypt that joseph had to tell the lie because shepherds are abomination to the egyptians and that's how this age is as now you say i'm a preacher they say oh one of them all of those money scandals and money everything that money that they're all in people's minds and that mentality is one of is the same thing that is destroying the family structure because the same position of the president to the nation is the same position of a pastor to his church the same position of a prophet to a generation the same position of a man to his home [Music] amen politicians are just liars they are just crook and we say all of that and we and we say there are things that are happening we can't say that they are not happening but it is a god instituted ordained place and we must respect the man that is there that's the thing that is destroying the very core of the society what is destroying is that it's destroying our trust and confidence in leadership that's what is destroyed amen we don't have no respect for leaders whether it is the boss our job whether that wouldn't there just no respect for leaders i just i don't i just here to make my money i'm not here for anybody and we think in that way we are appealing to god's mercy no that's the thing that is making everything around us is falling everything around us is crumbling even the world are supposed to lead us we don't even have respect to the world the center is destroyed nothing can hold nothing can hold so elasher lamentation when he cried and tore his clothes oh my father right you are the powerhouse of israel because the sin of jeroboam was eating the people praise the lord you know this age is just like richard when rachel left her father house she stole her father idol praise the lord and that's how we live the nomination and and we see the other their way of doing things we come with our denominational mind our denomination of uh secret things praise the lord because we have our mindset how god should work for us we have higher god they said isaiah said god said command me so we must command him that word means acts of me amen who are you to commend god amen are we together now so we see here that elijah was not just crying out of sympathy or crying because he needed a double potion but he was crying because he have understood and knew what the ministry of elijah was not only to him but to the hold of israel that this man is the powerhouse this man is the force that was carrying the nation and that's the scene where the bride stands on the earth she's the one that is keeping the wrath of god she's the moon that is controlling the ties the lord god just looking for one earnest heart warning is hard i will just stand for truth and what is right praise the lord lord be to god in the message look watch elijah when he accepted it praise the lord amen when he accepted it you know his life must have been renewed when he accepted what praise the lord amen yeah it is it's it's it's expressing is giving us an understanding that elijah was now running in his own strength something happened the bible says he kept his hair between his knees something happened and the prophet of god who says that the name struck the mechanics the dynamic struck the mechanic that is the thing that make the church to get up and start moving you don't have to push them you don't have to beg them when that thing's trucks home they get on their feet and it starts to move and starts to live like a son of god live like a god of god [Music] when he accepted it you know his life ma has been renewed he i run in her chariot he run before the terror when he couldn't even climb a hill his physical strength could not go up the hill but yeah he had a strain to run ahead of a chair oh my my goodness lord help us let's stop playing church let's get up let's wait let this thing struck home let this word struck home when he couldn't even climb a hill he run before those swiss chairs those swift horses get the rainbow out was that his message there's going to be a ring bring the ball out my people bring the bar our rain is coming [Laughter] oh glory be to god hallelujah amen i hear the sound of abundance of rain praise the lord man i'm telling you a prosperity gospel preacher can take this and take every down from your pocket he can take sound of abundance of rain and take every down from your pocket even your married ring you come and put in the plate making gamble with the word of god praise the lord but we're telling you what this message what what what god has already ordained you to be is in you it just to get it from your slothfulness [Music] it's in you it's not coming from anywhere i don't have it to give it to you it's in you [Music] [Applause] i hear the sound of abundance of rain the first little move glory the first little move at the pool of bethesda what happened they rushed to the water he says when you see the move of the water jump in it jump in it don't argue praise the lord if god has kept you right then he have a purpose for you praise the lord he have a purpose for you hallelujah the first little move about the pool of bethesda the rush and they get into it oh it's the people here yeah if you haven't received the holy ghost this morning praise the lord i mean there is this room is so full it's so charged right now praise the lord is so charged right now that nobody should live with an unconfessed sin praise the lord because there is enough blood on the mercy seat for you to confess your sin praise the lord amen no desire of evil bring those desires those haunting thoughts and hunting desire lord heaven said i give it to you the problem is that we enjoy it so we put it in our pocket and we take it back home [Music] because we want the pleasure of it but yeah we know that is destroying our lives that's the truth there's a man telling the world that that's the truth then hurry as quick as you can don't wait what are you looking for what are you waiting for praise the lord that's right amen there's only god i can make it better for you amen that's that's his principle hallelujah he never get in depth with anybody you give him anything he make it better and give it back to you get moving towards it as fast as you can as fast as you can but we will learn from the scripture revelation chapter 6 we will learn from the scripture that this age also has uh a press on it in revelation chapters chapter 6 and uh wednesday night we were talking about the four living creatures the full powered around the throne revelation chapter 6 also identified four beasts amen there's the the the the the white house amen the red the black [Music] but i want you to notice go back read your scripture notice that in all of those beats their name was never mentioned the name of the rather was never mentioned until the last beast until the last beast which is the pill house which of course now it was the combining of all of those power religious political demonic power was all brought together now in the pill house and the bible says his name is called death with hell he has such a power to pull hell on the people when the prophet of god said the land is taken out of hell there are forces that is pulling hair on the people destruction and i mean and things things i mean uh such such an age you know and that is the reason why we have to be thankful to god we have to be grateful to god that in the midst of everything we can still pick up our bible to read we can say come to church we must be thankful to god amen if you think that you will get everything right before you start serving god praise the lord but bram says i should not even wish hell to my to my worst enemy so i won't say that to you praise the lord but you can see it you can see the the the press that is on us why we have all of these struggles in our homes praise the lord the devil was never married before so marriage is not his interest praise the lord amen right from eden he's just been kind of messing around with with people's wife and all of those things are out there and you see that when when when when all of these little arguments and faucets and things hero makes us to see that he's the one doing it he says is the brother this is the sister is this person and as long as he can leave us like that and just get fussy just go on and look for something else to do see how much he can put the pressure on us so he can have a one-month vacation and let and leave us walking at our thoughts and arguing and blaming one another looking for every thought in the preacher looking for every thought in the church and looking for every thought everything that is not going right amen i just gave him time to go for vacation he's a businessman even a vacation he's he's catching out he's investing he's looking for something to do praise the lord so we see this we see this now bring it to the time of israel there was the sin of jeroboam what jeroboam did he established idols in three cities of israel a good symbol of the trinity and he told the people he said yellow israel this is your god that brought you why should you spend time and go all the way to jerusalem to the temple of solomon to worship and slowly that thing started eating the people up they gave every reason not to go to jerusalem they can just go right there and worship and start start eating the people up amen people start getting themselves involved in idolatry and it became such a sin such a power that even the king of israel ahab was pooled to go and marry an adult worshiper's daughter that was where the church and idolatry marry which means idolatry now was on the throne amen idolatry was on the throne that's the reason why if you don't balance yourself in the word of god you can still be in this message and you'll be worshiping idols you will make brother branham your idol you will make your pastor your adam you will make your church your idol because idolatry got married and then it's on the throne it's on the throne it's now ruling the people they have come crying he won't never van yeah jessica said why are you crying are you not a king i don't like no weak man you are weakling come crying why are you crying for are you not a king if you are the king everything of this land belongs to you a neighbor was killed on his father's inheritance and it was engineered by the woman that was on the throne amen are we together so you see it was such out of place there was there was such an evil power evil pressing adultery that was now moving capturing israel capturing israel if you read the book of chronicles you will learn that all the priests and the people that could not support that idolatry they move towards judah now that is that is where you know theologian gets mixed up anything that's a missing trap of israel no no it was because if you were a priest and you were not subscribed to build worship you will be killed so those priests that wanted to stay under the worship of the world they would sneak out and they moved to judah amen the people that were in judah and they got tired with their pastor they got tired when they passed away with this thing here they they will slip out and move over to the northern kingdom praise the lord and this idolatry was just was just eating the people consuming the people that's the reason why god had to send a ministry like the minister of elijah a man that bounced on the scene we don't know where he came from nothing about his mother nothing about his father we don't know about his upbringing but he just has such a message go straight to the king and say you are the one you are the one that is troubling israel a fearless man praise the lord because he knew oh heaven was behind him praise the lord all heaven was back in the word when god sent a gosm messenger that is the powerhouse of god for that age paul was the powerhouse of his age that's the reason why he could stand and say god will judge the word according to my gospel he could see it like that because he knew where he was standing with god he knew he was the powerhouse [Music] praise the lord oh my god a good old-fashioned holy ghost sent revival man back to believe in the word of god that god will take care of us like he did in the old days he still take years praise the lord he still take care of us if alarm clock could wake people up we should send it to the graveyard or send it to the mark praise the lord if god don't wake you up you won't hear that alarm clock ranking so god still take years like he did in days of all he would take care of us today do you believe that god will take care of us what we need today is another refilling amen another like the disciples i love this he says some of you trying to test an experience or trust it that they had 10 years ago that's all right but what about today amen that ten years ago two years ago must be the same today because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not the hours he's the i am yes that's all right but what's about today we need one today today is the day show a feeling the disciples about three or four days after they received the holy ghost they went back and got in one call and they began to pray again with one accord until the holy ghost shook the building as chapter two as chapter four amen praise the lord you just don't lay it on one experience because it should carry you from experience to experience from one experience to another experience hallelujah until the holy ghost shook the building where they were he said one thing why cry one thing that the tabernacle needs of that at our church or we can say yeah good shepherd is the real dedication or a refilling of the holy ghost everyone get down at the altar and pray until they get a renewing of the holy ghost amen i mean with a kind of a crazy word that we are living in pick your bible pick the word of god read a promise of god get get an assurance of god in the morning just read that read that and let that pages speak to you it gives you such a confidence no matter what is happening out there it gives you such a confidence to be able to face the day praise the lord amen we i mean we we have re-echoed and re-equivalence and then we can still re-era this morning what shall i do with jesus the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the holy ghost you know the principle of the dynamics and the mechanics praise the lord this is like our all our you know nice vehicles all parked in the parking lot there if you don't have gasoline in it it's not going to spark whatever it is press button whether you talk to it or you turn the key or you push it down the hill if it does not have the sparking oil in it it will not amen spark right praise the lord it will not spark it can be tesla it can be 2 2 20 23 vehicle the moment you have to push the car it's embarrassing your car's supposed to carry you well you have to stand on the road and start pushing praise a lot people don't look at the brand name again they don't look at the brand name they don't look at the behind say which car he pushing [Music] the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the hair stone is coming down that's all what's happening all through the ages and that's the same thing that is happening with the fightful ministry we have these brothers comes and and every one of them preaching and then we get on fire we shout always a good service and then the next service wednesday now we come oh god peter glory crazy what's happening the son of servant is supposed to prepare us for wednesday service the blessing of the son itself servants supposed to bring us up and we clapping our hands and we and we're thanking god and we thank you and we praise him and then wednesday said we prepare for sunday morning we come back with praises again it looks like we have to push this wagon what it needs is the dynamic it needs the dynamic the holy ghost to make this thing real to you that we are not making church we are having church there's a difference between making church and having church we are having church we are rejoicing in the promises that has been given to us [Music] praise the lord oh my my father my father the chariot of israel the chariot of israel and the husband thereof that's why elijah was saying you are the one he tore his clothes because he identified the anointing he identified the responsibility that goes with the ministry it's not copy and paste people he saw it oh my father yes amen that's the reason why god have to give him a double potion a double portion because he knew what he was facing he knew the spirit of idolatry now an elijah is not around praise the lord he's going to deal with those same spirits that elijah was dealing with praise the lord amen you know when you get to that place where where the scripture says you know the woman was now sub-authority i spoke a little bit of that on wednesday night you realize that people don't understand that they just think that it's a kind of obsessive thing you know that they will always have an interpretation for rape but you see god back his word he back his word why because when uh uh uh uh uh other original creation adam and eve they were co-equal praise the lord amen they were called equal and and and the enemy comes to eve he twists the word and got her reasoning with him yes when god says thou shalt surely die he makes a sound thou shalt naturally dare three letter words he dropped right in there rob her of the power that she had praise the lord amen now so you see uh because just like i have said over and over when god made a woman genesis 2 7 uh uh uh in genesis 2 when when when god took you know out of the red the bible says he you know i put adam to a deep slave and what happened is that uh we learned he he gives the woman three sacred value now almighty god with his own knowledge before they now happen as a surprise to god we should know better than that amen we should know better than people says but why the god may uh uh adam to sin why the god made it you have never known god to be a healer you have never known him to be a deliverer praise the lord we know better than that amen and we must teach our children better than that praise the lord but then he placed these three sacrifices in the woman invisible union the prophet said is because of redemption so those three sacrifices will now serve as the woman's power her power is hidden behind her weakness praise the lord amen now so god will now instruct a man and place the man at that place of leadership so he's in the head he's in the front but he has this woman behind him amen that has three sacrifices she has a threefold purpose in her that's her power the prophet of god says and a man he says any man will take out his heart every time one of those virtues is rightly displayed it's a hating power she have it in her to give life to be a mother she's the mother of all living she makes a dead home to live it's in her it's in her praise the lord so you see the power uh the way that god distributed it he is it's not like he he robbed the woman when people think that it should be just like the muslims do put all the men to the front and the women to the back they are caught unclean no that's not why we're running here that's not god's order it's not a teaching or a religion of men dominate woman no that's not why we're running we are putting everybody in their place say the man must be the man of his home he must take the word lead and instruct us home praise the lord the redeemer was not promised to adam it was not the seed of a man it was the seed of the woman that would bruise the serpent head praise the lord i can prove it through the scripture prove it through the word prove it through the message but ram says supreme mother can do more than a man in the pulpit it's a seal of the woman that bruises the serpent head if the woman can rightly find her place and rightly use though god gave him that to you no wonder we can have revival god can send gifts and everything else to set it and do miracles and perform things and people said no wonder they're seen in a camp we got to clean the clean that thing out and operate praise the lord we can never run a church with this earnest thing amen this earnest being suspicious of one another it's a mess you can't run a church like that you can never run at home like that we will now have a successful family if we are dishonest to one another you're trying to build a twins tower two separate tower that runs parallel not supposed to be a twin star with people we got to clean the thing out and operate that's exactly right and have the church straighten up and running right praise the lord have the church straightened up and running right half our lives stretching up and running right and then god will come in and go and doing signs and wonders among us just just simple principle just put things in their place the law of god will work i'm telling you a person does not have to be a message believer for this law to work it's an unwritten lord it's an unwritten lord praise the lord that's why sometimes we get confused well they're they're not they're not christians but they're having happy family it's all because they have broke into the law of god [Music] it's a law that is written in nature amen but we think now we are christian we get this bible praise the lord the bible that's supposed to help our we use it to fight when we're supposed to be reading it we're knocking one another with it but the bible says yeah the bible said too we are not building an organization i'm not here this morning to build an organization i can stand behind the prophet of god and say the same thing i'm not here this morning to be on an organization christ never sent me to build an organization christ sent me to build individuals individuals to the statue of christ that they might be their powerhouse for you to be a powerhouse that's the purpose of this message to build individuals you have to start a move serotonin move four beasts move ah a full cherubim move three or live move it's not to start a movement among the people but to build a son of god that when there is no church there is nobody living he will be a son of god he will be a son of god he will live to the truth conscious of his mind you don't have to be looking over his shoulder i mean you will be a son of god she will be a daughter of god [Music] send to build an individual to the statute of christ that there might be a powerhouse a dwelling place of the spirit by the word by the word there it is that's an emphasis not a spirit by emotion a spirit by the word it must line up with the word not a spirit by feelings it must be the spirit by the world be of the individual to that place praise the lord praise the lord i mean what a man can be a man he goes to work he's he's he's not working he's he's you know doing his best and working there is no tricky thought in his mind what my wife doing he knows that she's doing what she's supposed to do [Music] that's right that's right then why am i not hubby what are you doing now but that trust is not in the man it's not in the flesh it's in god you are trusting god that he will be you're the hustler he you want him to be you are trusting god that she will be the wife that you want him to be not micro management you don't you don't need a remote it's 12 o'clock now you're supposed to be cooking dinner [Music] praise the lord we will travel on tuesday uh for sister bridget's wedding that is coming up this coming saturday and then uh i'm sure to be back in church next sunday so you pray for me uh not this coming sunday now the following sunday i will be in church so you pray for me in our sweet travel and there are a few things that are with us there beside the wedding trying to shout away from it there are some home responsibilities but being able to talk to a few of the the brothers there so just pray for me and we trust that the lord will be able to keep us and bring us back safe praise the lord that they can say they are trusted men that we have the law through the holy spirit has placed over this assembly and we believe that they are going to do what the office require them to do but as we will continue to to you know learn from this thought praise the lord and uh if you uh uh [Music] if the folks back there can just go back to our uh wednesday night called let's read that from pajamas church h again now the homily of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father amen john 5 19 he said i do nothing except what the father shows me praise the lord this harmony is now to exist between the groom and the bride now that is christ in us praise the lord amen don't tell your husband says the pastor say i do nothing until you tell me oh you're not supposed to do nothing you're not supposed to use that money until i tell you that's what the word says i know i'm going into into uncharted areas but this is christ this is christ people jesus christ and the bride praise the lord my responsibility is to preach the word brother branham says and i trust god your responsibility is to carry out and it's not my responsibility to rule your homes no it's not my responsibility if if it is to advise i will advise i'm not supposed to tell you what to eat on monday what to eat on tuesday i'm not running a health club praise the lord this is the house of the lord this harmony is now to exist between the groom jesus christ and the bride amen the rapture in church he shows her his word his word of life and she receive it she don't argue she don't struggle she receive it just like mary be it unto me amen mary asked a question though how would this thing happen realizing i've never known a man he says the holy spirit will overshadow you thank you lord so if you have a question it's not wrong to ask your question if you want to to to understand better and walk in faith not a question because you want to prove a point she never doubted it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again here is the secret the word is in the bride the word is in the bride amen it was better for you that you never heard truth but this world will haunt you no matter what choice you make if you ever hear truth it will haunt you the rest of

error as you as we keep receiving the word it starts to change us it starts correcting things in our life the word is in the bride the bride has the mind of christ it's an opportunity that is giving to us everything what do we do with the word when when we are faced with situation that's right amen how do we use the word yes to answer a harsh neighbor or someone rule other work my goodness we
