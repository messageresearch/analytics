[38:14] handle the call because of the the nail
[38:16] problem that she had
[38:18] and then uh
[38:20] slowly she went into having problems
[38:23] with her heart
[38:25] she had fluid around her heart and the
[38:28] doctors were were kind of for treating
[38:30] that they extract extracted
[38:32] the fluid and got her on a diet because
[38:35] they wanted to get her to a certain
[38:37] place to see if they could do some
[38:38] procedure on her
[38:41] so while she was awaiting there
[38:44] in the midst of that her gallbladder
[38:46] rapture
[38:47] you know and then he affected her system
[38:50] so he threw her body into a shock
[38:52] and uh and so she
[38:55] she there's that's how she cross over
[38:59] so we uh uh
[39:02] we we thank the lord
[39:04] we thank the lord uh
[39:06] that she fought a good fight of faith
[39:08] praise the lord
[39:11] and uh

[39:19] got a call in the morning before i left
[39:21] home
[39:22] that she was rushed to the hospital
[39:25] and i think that was just in time when
[39:27] her body went into shock
[39:29] so
[39:34] when you rush her over to the hospital
[39:40] the doctors
[39:41] knew that
[39:44] uh
[39:46] yeah the the the situation was
[39:50] was uh really at the place uh to really
[39:53] get it under control most especially
[39:55] with the weakness of her body
[39:57] and uh
[39:59] and also the fairness of her body so
[40:02] they asked the family to come
[40:04] and spend some time with her before
[40:07] uh
[40:08] she would cross his life so

[49:34] [Music]
[49:36] so
[49:38] and while we were dating and
[49:42] yeah then finally they announced to us
[49:44] that she has passed
[49:46] brother branham said this in the message
[49:49] it shall
[49:50] it shall even be as i told
[49:53] as it was told me
[49:56] now so
[49:57] i'm i just took a phrase here to be able
[50:00] to give my subject but uh uh
[50:04] what what the scene was
[50:06] with this with this i'm about to read
[50:08] just a sentence here what the scene was
[50:11] there was a baby
[50:13] that uh
[50:15] that
[50:16] that was dying
[50:19] so
[50:20] the the mother
[50:22] called
[50:23] one of the sisters in the church
[50:25] and uh
[50:26] i i i don't think she was not in the
[50:28] tabernacle but she called one of the
[50:30] sisters in the tabernacle and and they
[50:32] got brother branham on the phone
[50:34] and and it says brother brandon you know
[50:37] this this baby is dying can you please
[50:39] pray and ask the lord you know be
[50:41] merciful but very much he says well okay
[50:43] i'll pray
[50:44] and he went praying and asking the lord
[50:47] and you know and
[50:49] and then he broke into a vision and saw
[50:51] that the baby was alive
[50:53] so he gave the babe he he gave uh
[50:56] uh the sister the call
[50:59] and said sister thou said the lord the
[51:01] baby is not going to die the baby is
[51:03] going to live
[51:04] then the mother said
[51:08] is the mother that said this few words
[51:09] she said oh
[51:11] about five minutes ago
[51:13] we were watching
[51:15] for the last birth
[51:20] she says about five minutes ago
[51:23] we were watching
[51:24] for the last birth
[51:26] and that's how i felt when we i was in
[51:29] the hospital
[51:30] i was watching
[51:32] for the last birth
[51:35] praise the lord
[51:37] so we want to talk a little bit on
[51:39] the last birth tonight we pray that the
[51:41] lord will just make it a blessing
[51:44] amen
[51:46] let me read this now now question and
[51:49] answers here he said
[51:53] i was at a friend house yesterday
[51:56] a christian home where there was some
[51:59] young christians gathered
[52:01] and i was talking to them
[52:05] and something just presented itself to
[52:08] me and i thought of how i was looking
[52:11] into the wolves and and around the trees
[52:15] and see them dying
[52:17] i thought how pretty those trees
[52:20] are even though
[52:22] they are dying that is almost about fall
[52:25] or something like that
[52:27] winter coming in yet they are pretty
[52:33] and sometimes a tree looks
[52:36] better when it's dying than when it then
[52:39] when it is
[52:41] in the greenness and bits
[52:43] and i wonder if there's just
[52:47] if that just wouldn't picture
[52:51] out our condition to our heavenly father
[52:54] for he said pressure
[52:57] in the sight of the lord
[52:59] is the death of his sins
[53:03] how that much beautiful thing for the
[53:06] father to look down upon his children
[53:08] coming home
[53:10] to him
[53:11] and
[53:12] holding his position
[53:16] in christ coming home and holding the
[53:19] opposition in christ
[53:21] so i i got to the bad side and i was i
[53:25] was trying to
[53:26] i was holding sister mimi henson and i
[53:29] was trying to rob her hands
[53:32] and you know like brother branham said
[53:34] he like he did to his mama and says mama
[53:36] do you still love the lord he says mama
[53:39] couldn't talk but you could see the
[53:40] tears coming down her eyes and i felt
[53:43] like she said yes i love the lord mama
[53:45] are you ready to go home and he says
[53:47] then more tears came down i felt like
[53:50] mama said yes i'm ready to go home but
[53:52] you see sister mimi didn't know how to
[53:54] experience that because
[53:56] uh her system was so affected until it
[53:59] even affected her brain
[54:01] yeah it even affected her brain
[54:04] so
[54:05] we were just did uh watching but the
[54:08] nurse the nurse said uh the nurse says
[54:11] uh uh uh shikuya
[54:14] you know she says uh the only thing that
[54:16] might be
[54:17] working now is is her hearing
[54:20] and uh
[54:21] uh you know and all of that but like
[54:23] brother branham said here he says
[54:33] how beautiful a beautiful thing for the
[54:35] father to look down upon his child
[54:38] coming home
[54:40] and holding
[54:41] his or her position in christ his faith
[54:45] his confession
[54:48] i'm saved by grace i'm saved by the
[54:50] grace of god
[54:52] and stand there in the hour of death
[54:56] praise the lord
[54:59] yet we can hold our position we are safe
[55:02] and i believe that our father
[55:07] loved the guiling trade and believing
[55:10] and holding our testimony
[55:14] and it's just acing to testify when you
[55:17] are feeling good
[55:19] and healthy and strong
[55:21] is when you are down weak in trouble
[55:25] there's where your testimony counts
[55:29] amen
[55:31] praise the lord
[55:33] amen amen you know a child sister maybe
[55:36] was someone a few words
[55:41] but you really get to yell her talking
[55:42] when you visit visit her at the house
[55:44] you know every time i would go to visit
[55:46] she had a lot of questions you asked
[55:48] you know and we were talking
[55:50] and uh
[55:54] and you know and just fellowship
[55:57] she was a woman of fight
[55:59] you know uh and and and
[56:02] a prayer warrior too
[56:04] you know sometimes i'll i will
[56:07] go and visit she and brother jambibi
[56:09] just just to pray with them
[56:12] and more more likely to have them pray
[56:14] with me
[56:16] praise the lord
[56:18] now so uh
[56:20] uh
[56:24] you know just like i said
[56:27] you know it's it's it's it's like the
[56:30] anxiousness
[56:32] of uh
[56:33] waiting for life to come into this earth
[56:37] i believe this that's what
[56:40] the
[56:41] the psalmist meant when he says
[56:43] pressures in the sight of the lord there
[56:45] is anxiousness on the other side
[56:48] you know
[56:49] when
[56:50] when it's announced that one of the
[56:52] saints are coming home
[56:54] there's anxiousness
[56:57] uh to
[56:58] to
[56:59] to meet them
[57:01] praise the lord that's how precious it
[57:04] is it might not be precious to us on
[57:06] this side
[57:07] but it's precious on the other side very
[57:10] precious praise the lord amen
[57:14] and so there is something you know uh
[57:18] that is that is that is beautiful
[57:20] about life
[57:24] it just had to be
[57:26] something that god created
[57:29] it's just it's just so beautiful when
[57:30] you just think about everything let me
[57:32] just share another quote here with you
[57:34] brother branham now in this one he's
[57:36] he's talking about we read a few quotes
[57:38] about
[57:39] last birth but in this one he's going to
[57:42] talk about a young
[57:44] sister
[57:45] that just thought she had it all
[57:47] together you know being sassy
[57:49] and
[57:51] you know
[57:52] trying to live the best of her life
[57:55] she's a year in the message particle he
[57:57] says and i found out
[58:00] dear friends
[58:02] that men mentoring
[58:04] will now stand
[58:06] when you are coming down to your last
[58:08] birth
[58:09] of this body
[58:12] and this life
[58:14] is good to live by those things
[58:18] but
[58:20] you can die by them
[58:23] praise the lord
[58:24] man material many inventions and all of
[58:27] that
[58:28] i mean
[58:29] uh your your smartwatch can be able to
[58:32] tell you your your pause it can tell you
[58:35] how many steps you have walked he can
[58:38] tell you your heartbeat
[58:40] praise the lord
[58:41] but when that heart is about to stop
[58:45] he can never have it to beat another
[58:47] time again
[58:48] you know so all of these things they are
[58:51] good as we use them
[58:53] he says i guess in my ministry
[58:55] my age in the ministry i have probably
[58:58] stood
[58:59] by many dying people
[59:02] as anyone
[59:03] of my age because i have been much
[59:06] called
[59:07] on to the dying
[59:10] praise the lord
[59:11] not long ago a certain young lady
[59:14] in our city had had received the baptism
[59:17] of the holy ghost she came she came up
[59:19] to the tabernacle
[59:21] another young lady
[59:24] in a city very popular belonging to a
[59:27] modern type of a religion
[59:29] that denied the blood and the covering
[59:31] and said that
[59:33] we were a cut
[59:35] and a bunch of holy roller because that
[59:37] we believe in the saving grace of christ
[59:41] if that's if that's what it takes to be
[59:43] a holy ruler then yeah you count me in
[59:46] amen
[59:47] and then i'm one of them i believe in
[59:49] the blood amen
[59:50] this young lady
[59:51] [Music]
[59:53] she went on to dance and show
[59:55] and she
[59:57] and she was a sunday school teacher in
[59:58] their church
[1:00:00] and and the church denied the blood of
[1:00:02] christ and there was no such a thing the
[1:00:05] pastor said he says it dry 1900 years
[1:00:08] ago so they believe in this spiritual
[1:00:11] gospel and
[1:00:12] by and by the young lady got out with
[1:00:16] some boy
[1:00:17] and uh fine looking
[1:00:19] lady
[1:00:20] this uh
[1:00:22] uh little girl
[1:00:24] come up to the tabernacle she kind of
[1:00:26] addressed which means the sister now in
[1:00:29] church that's what he's talking about
[1:00:31] kind of address all factions she used to
[1:00:34] go down the street and she would let she
[1:00:37] and and
[1:00:39] and her hair come back just as tight as
[1:00:41] she can get
[1:00:42] get it without these you know whatever
[1:00:45] he called it yet
[1:00:48] and ever watch stuff
[1:00:50] that they wear down on the street he
[1:00:52] said yes that's the truth
[1:00:54] we teach against that he says god will
[1:00:58] make
[1:00:59] you pray in your ways
[1:01:02] pray the age as prayed it does as i was
[1:01:05] saying
[1:01:06] but even our holiness churches are
[1:01:09] letting them
[1:01:11] praise the lord
[1:01:12] you know
[1:01:14] that's the truth
[1:01:16] you better come back to the old hailing
[1:01:19] line again back to the gospel now we see
[1:01:22] with all of these things i mean uh uh
[1:01:25] just this other few days uh just this
[1:01:28] gone weekend uh i was just thinking
[1:01:30] about you know the weight behind what
[1:01:34] the apostle paul said when he i mean
[1:01:36] what he meant when he said perilous
[1:01:39] times shall come
[1:01:41] praise the lord
[1:01:42] i believe that uh a
[1:01:46] parallel time is upon us
[1:01:50] perilous time is upon us not too long we
[1:01:53] would think we were speaking about uh uh
[1:01:56] the diagnosis of the age and brother
[1:01:57] branham talking about uh how this age uh
[1:02:01] being described by jesus christ in
[1:02:03] revelation chapter three that uh
[1:02:06] the blind and and don't know what they
[1:02:09] then they are naked you know it's it's
[1:02:11] all the mental condition you know uh a
[1:02:13] mental condition that the church is
[1:02:16] losing its mind and and we see those
[1:02:19] things and and in the way that people
[1:02:23] try to think that they are not losing
[1:02:26] their mind is in a way that they think
[1:02:28] that they are trying to be
[1:02:30] they are trying to be modding they are

[1:03:46] place but it's perilous time
[1:03:49] that is upon us
[1:03:52] praise the lord
[1:03:54] the people are getting high-minded
[1:03:58] and all the thing there is that i'm just
[1:04:00] following my heart that's the way to say
[1:04:02] it
[1:04:03] i'm just following my heart
[1:04:05] i'm just doing me
[1:04:08] that's how they call it
[1:04:13] but it's perilous time
[1:04:16] it's the last spirit
[1:04:18] that is on them look you cannot you
[1:04:21] cannot beat this last spirit how how how
[1:04:24] can i overcome brother branham says just
[1:04:26] like every age
[1:04:28] god the god the he says every uh uh uh
[1:04:32] uh uh
[1:04:35] following age every age that succeeded
[1:04:37] from the other got the reward of the age
[1:04:41] that they that they succeeded from he
[1:04:43] said that's the same way the age that is
[1:04:46] succeeding also got the the forces that
[1:04:50] came from the ephesus age went down to
[1:04:52] the next
[1:04:53] so all the demons that fought the church

[1:04:58] a right here
[1:05:00] the spirit of ananias and sapphira the
[1:05:03] spirit of the sons of cephas

[1:05:30] part of the ministry
[1:05:33] we have all those things right right
[1:05:35] here in our day right here in the
[1:05:37] message
[1:05:39] because it was in that move of god it
[1:05:41] has to be in this move of god
[1:05:53] he says even the holiness people
[1:05:55] are letting down
[1:05:58] praise the lord
[1:06:03] they're gone from
[1:06:06] the prayer meetings and
[1:06:08] waiting on the lord and and fasting and
[1:06:10] praying and all we are about is yes uh

[1:06:16] and whatever it is but let's let's just
[1:06:18] stay with this thing tonight and no face
[1:06:21] this young lady she just carried on
[1:06:24] everywhere went out dancing potted and
[1:06:27] so far and and then she took shake she
[1:06:30] got of an her disease and was too far
[1:06:32] gone
[1:06:35] try
[1:06:36] some shot but it did not work
[1:06:39] and when death struck
[1:06:41] the girl she began
[1:06:44] to get uh hysteric
[1:06:47] now
[1:06:49] her mind started going
[1:06:51] now that if you read this you realize
[1:06:54] that and and you read
[1:06:57] on this subject you realize that brother
[1:06:59] branham says when you get to that place
[1:07:04] of your last birth
[1:07:06] that's when the reality of life
[1:07:09] sinks in
[1:07:12] things becomes more real to you
[1:07:17] quickly you realize that you have wasted
[1:07:19] your time
[1:07:20] quickly you realize that the dance the
[1:07:23] fun and all of those things you were
[1:07:25] doing were just waste of time
[1:07:30] praise the lord
[1:07:32] you see we are living in the shadow we
[1:07:35] are living in the negative
[1:07:37] and when you get closer to the positive
[1:07:41] then you start to realize
[1:07:44] the real you
[1:07:47] the real thing that wait for you on the
[1:07:49] other side
[1:07:51] praise the lord she started shouting
[1:07:54] the first thing she said the first thing
[1:07:56] that she said was she started calling
[1:07:59] for that other girl
[1:08:01] the one that have gone down to the
[1:08:02] tabernacle and got the holy ghost
[1:08:04] because she used to tease her
[1:08:09] so she started calling for that girl
[1:08:12] and now when she when she asked they
[1:08:13] thought she was sending for her sunday
[1:08:15] school teacher she said no i'm not
[1:08:17] that's not what and the pastor came
[1:08:18] quickly and trying to comfort her the
[1:08:20] first thing she said you deceive her you
[1:08:22] lied to me
[1:08:25] that's right

[1:09:01] and she said you deceiver of man i'm
[1:09:03] lost i'm going to hell because you
[1:09:06] taught me dead
[1:09:10] and they get there
[1:09:11] and went out to meet god
[1:09:13] crying for the girl that had tried to
[1:09:16] tell her
[1:09:18] what was right
[1:09:21] look brother

[1:09:43] actually there is nothing really matters
[1:09:47] what really matters
[1:09:50] is the god that brought us here

[1:10:09] and and then and all the clothes are
[1:10:11] hanging there and you can't even wear it

[1:10:26] clean life before god be sure to
[1:10:28] remember that and i hope you young

[1:10:59] god i'm going to ask you whether what
[1:11:01] church you belong to is what in your
[1:11:03] heart

[1:11:30] like that lady said we were in five
[1:11:31] minutes
[1:11:33] we were just watching for the last birth
[1:11:36] but when brother branham gave the doubt
[1:11:38] said the lord
[1:11:40] it just flipped around
[1:11:44] and the baby became well
[1:11:46] but you see that's the way it is
[1:11:49] we on this side we are watching for the
[1:11:51] last birth but in five minutes that
[1:11:54] person just slept on the other side
[1:11:56] right in the presence of god
[1:11:59] and they are alive

[1:13:27] and we brave
[1:13:30] and then we cry out yeah
[1:13:32] yeah like the baby does
[1:13:34] one of these days we will have our last
[1:13:37] birth
[1:13:40] and then we will pass this mortal life
[1:13:44] and go in the presence of the one that
[1:13:46] brought us here but bam says brothers
[1:13:48] and sisters that's not
[1:13:51] that's not myth
[1:13:53] there's actual fight
[1:13:55] we don't know what time we are going
[1:13:58] and you will not have a chance after
[1:14:01] that last birth leave your body
[1:14:03] make it right now
[1:14:05] don't wait till the morning
[1:14:08] maybe
[1:14:09] too late
[1:14:11] praise the lord
[1:14:18] and as we
[1:14:20] we all stood there and talked to the
[1:14:22] family a little bit and just just asked
[1:14:25] to encourage them
[1:14:27] and
[1:14:29] you know uh
[1:14:36] and that machine you know that she was
[1:14:38] she was hooked to there was
[1:14:40] was kind of moving on hot
[1:14:43] but actually because i've tried to look
[1:14:45] at it and you could tell that it was you
[1:14:48] know it was it was just
[1:14:50] it was something that was that was net
[1:14:52] that was not real because they kind of
[1:14:54] switched all the you know all the little
[1:14:57] monitoring everything you just switch it
[1:14:59] off because the doctors knew what was
[1:15:01] happening
[1:15:02] praise the lord they knew that life was
[1:15:04] going out slowly
[1:15:06] and
[1:15:08] and when the
[1:15:09] the nurse came in the room
[1:15:11] and you know just gave us the last word
[1:15:14] we were in the room but they were they
[1:15:16] were also on the other side just
[1:15:17] monitoring everything and just seeing
[1:15:19] how things were happening you know
[1:15:22] so
[1:15:24] and
[1:15:25] it was
[1:15:26] you know just just standing the heading
[1:15:28] and you know uh for the nurse to say
[1:15:32] she's gone
[1:15:34] you know it was it was one of these
[1:15:35] things where
[1:15:37] you just you just you want to grab the
[1:15:39] sight of it
[1:15:42] i was just standing there
[1:15:43] and you just want to grab your side of
[1:15:45] it this is there she goes
[1:15:49] praise the lord
[1:15:51] but actually it was precious
[1:15:54] to
[1:15:55] to witness
[1:15:57] one cross in this life especially when
[1:15:59] you know
[1:16:01] that that is a believer
[1:16:03] you know that that person has lived
[1:16:05] their life for the lord you know sister
[1:16:08] mimi and and brother steve young baby
[1:16:10] like i said here before
[1:16:12] they were the first people that did
[1:16:13] receive the message in liberia
[1:16:16] uh when the brother took the message to
[1:16:18] liberia
[1:16:19] and uh and and and then uh
[1:16:22] at the time some of peter in uh uh new
[1:16:25] york connecticut there was was a youth
[1:16:28] pastor in the in the in the pentecostal
[1:16:30] church the word
[1:16:31] they were and that's that's just how the
[1:16:34] the
[1:16:35] took the message to him and it kind of
[1:16:37] created a wildfire because the upper
[1:16:41] room bible church at that time
[1:16:44] was uh
[1:16:46] was really
[1:16:47] it was a kind of a holiness church you
[1:16:49] know a church that really believed in
[1:16:52] clean living you know and and write in
[1:16:54] the address called and they believe in
[1:16:56] the gift of the spirit and all of that
[1:16:59] and but now for them to realize that uh
[1:17:03] uh you know uh
[1:17:05] uh they really didn't have uh you know
[1:17:07] the the baptism even uh water baptism
[1:17:11] right you know i mean it was it was just
[1:17:14] like mind blowing to those brothers and
[1:17:16] many of them many of them like that came
[1:17:19] out of the the some of the malachite and
[1:17:22] and many of them came out that was just
[1:17:25] how the message started in liberia and
[1:17:27] then we were then the next bunch that
[1:17:29] came to the faith so i mean they were
[1:17:32] they were very precious to me they were
[1:17:34] very precious to me and we just want to
[1:17:37] thank the lord for the life of our
[1:17:39] sister
[1:17:41] so like brother branham said it's not a
[1:17:42] myth it's it's it's an actual father
[1:17:46] we don't know when our time is going to
[1:17:48] come young people
[1:17:49] praise the lord
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:53] and now
[1:17:57] you know this is it's uh it's just the
[1:17:59] law that knows how he have known our
[1:18:01] dance
[1:18:03] praise the lord so i mean every breath
[1:18:06] that we breathe
[1:18:07] when we you get up in the morning
[1:18:09] and realize that
[1:18:12] your eyes can open
[1:18:14] you know
[1:18:15] i mean uh the way you put your phone on
[1:18:18] on a plug you block your phone to charge
[1:18:21] it you don't put your you don't block
[1:18:22] your heart
[1:18:25] you don't put your body on block
[1:18:29] he said let me let me pluck myself so i
[1:18:31] can
[1:18:32] i said let me pluck my phone so i wake
[1:18:34] up he can't be dead
[1:18:36] you don't block yourself
[1:18:40] it's almighty god
[1:18:42] amen that's right that's right yes that
[1:18:45] wakes you up in the morning
[1:18:47] it's not even your alarm that wakes you
[1:18:49] up
[1:18:50] if the alarm can wake people i will
[1:18:51] carry it to the cemetery
[1:19:03] that's the reason why sometimes you set
[1:19:05] an alarm and you wake up before your
[1:19:07] alarmed
[1:19:09] praise the lord
[1:19:10] and sometimes you said it you sleep
[1:19:12] through it
[1:19:17] you have no idea
[1:19:21] you just think that someone have a dream
[1:19:23] somebody playing music behind the house
[1:19:32] because it's only the altar of life
[1:19:34] that gives life
[1:19:37] praise the lord
[1:19:39] and
[1:19:40] we just pray that lord will be able to
[1:19:42] help every one of us
[1:19:44] see that's that's the reason why our
[1:19:46] house sing that song
[1:19:48] i will not turn my back on him now
[1:19:51] he has given me everything
[1:19:54] that i have he gave me my first birth
