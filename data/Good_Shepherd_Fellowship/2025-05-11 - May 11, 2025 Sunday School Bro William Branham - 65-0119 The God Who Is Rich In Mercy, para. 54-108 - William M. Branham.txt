========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] does not commit sin. The worshipper once purge has no more conscience of sin, no more desire to sin. The sin questions over. You become a part of God in Christ. Christ died to redeem you. Now, just think of all that we would have been if it hadn't been for God. But God in his rich mercy, how he has redeemed us tonight. Where would we been tonight if it hadn't been for God's rich mercy upon us once the world was so sinful that man had caused corruption to come upon the earth until it even grieved God that he ever made man? The whole head was uh putified sore. The whole body and God even greed that he ever made a man. So he said, "I will destroy man who I've created. He will destroy him because he is nothing but just a bunch of corruption." And the whole human race would have been wiped out at that time. But God rich in mercy would not let the innocent perish with the guilty. And he went away and made a provided way for the ones that wanted to come in, that wanted to do what was right. He made a way of mercy for those who desired mercy. And he prepared an ark. In other words, he uh put some wings on his eagles that they could fly above the judgment and not drown with the chickens. But he um he made a way of an escape in the days of Noah. This caused him to do that to provide it because he was rich in mercy. Amen. But after he has provided a way for people and then they refuse it. Now the reason they refuse it is because there's nothing in there to receive it. There's nothing to receive it. My mother used to say you cannot get blood from a turnup because there's no blood in a turnup. So if there is no form of life in there to receive it, then it cannot be received. That's the reason the Pharisees could look right in the face of Jesus and call him be the eliv because there was nothing in them to receive him. But all the father has given me, he said, will come to me. There there's some way it's going to be presented. You can talk to people sometime on the streets. Talk to them about the Lord. They laugh right in your face. Well, we're supposed to do it anyhow. But listen, there's no man can come to me except my father draws him first. God has to do the drawing. There has to be a life. And all that he has given me will come to me. He made a provision for those who wants to be redeemed. He made a provision for those who wants to be healed. And then because that he did this makes him rich in mercy as he's always been rich in mercy. It must u uh be if you refuse this there's nothing left but the judgment because sin must be judged. Pharaoh when he went into the the sea as an impersonator seeing that he could go in like Moses did. Moses with his army and Pharaoh with his army. Both of them should have perished in the sea looked like. But God, rich in mercy, made a way of escape for the Hebrew children. Why? Because they were following in the line of duty. They were following in the word. Amen. Now, that's the only way to obtain mercy is to follow the instructions that God has given us to follow him. That's the only way he can show mercy is when we follow what he said do. as a little debate not long ago with a minister that said that I was teaching an apostolic doctrine in this day. I believe I spoke of it a night or two ago or sometime about how he said you're trying to inject into this age an apostolic doctrine. He said the apostolic age ceased with the apostles. I asked him well do you believe the word? He said yes. I said Revelations 22:18 says that who shall ever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it. Not just two words, one word. Take one word out. Said I believe that. I said then I can tell you where the apostolic age was given. The apostolic blessings was given to the church. Now you tell me where God taken it out of the church by the word. You can't do it. It's not there. I said, "Now remember that Peter on the day of Pentecost, he was the the introducer of the apostolic age and he told them all to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise isn't to you and to your children, and to them as far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Amen. Now, if you want to listen to the clucking of some denominational hen and live back out there in the things of the world, then it goes to show that there's something wrong. Because that is the word. Whosoever will may come. And if you've got a will, you should come. But if you have no will, then you're in a sad condition. But if you've got a will to come, come follow God's formula. And he never fails to fulfill what he promised. I once was young and I'm old. I've never seen him fail in his word because he can do anything but fail. He cannot fail. God cannot. It's impossible for God to fail and remain God. He has to to do that. Now, Pharaoh's army tried to impersonate because they wasn't called and they had not that life into the the promise wasn't given to Pharaoh. The promise wasn't given for a promised land. And an impersonator trying to follow a real believer who's called such only makes a mockery out of it. That's what's the matter with our religious system today is too many people trying to impersonate the Holy Spirit. Too many people trying to impersonate the baptism. Too many people trying to impersonate the apostolic age. It's for believers. And that alone, God has made a way rich in mercy that his children would not perish. He's made a way for them. Now, Pharaoh trying to pursue on. He drowned in the very waters that saved Moses and his group. Now Moses did not drown because God is rich in mercy to them who are following his provided way. Amen. Can you see what I mean? That tonight people who don't believe in divine healing, people who do not believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost, how can they receive anything? God is rich in mercy to those who will follow after him. Amen. Not after a creed, but after God. God is the word that was made flesh and dwelt among us. Now that he might bring forth the other attributes of God, the body Jesus was the body of God, an attribute. Moses seen him pass the back part of him. No man had seen his face. But now we seen him. We have beheld him. Seen him as a sacrifice. Now he was an attribute of God being displayed the word. That's what he was. And when any believer comes to God, he becomes God's attribute of his word. He's used to manifest the word that's promised for that day. Amen. That's right. God rich in mercy has never left us without a testimony. He's rich in mercy. We find out that God was so merciful to Moses out there in that dead sea out in the uh Red Sea out there rather. Then when he said your in Exodus 19 four he said I carried you away on eagle's wings brought you to myself. Carried them on eagle's wings and brought you to myself. There was other man in the middle of that sea out there also trying to impersonate. But what he carried him on eagle's wings. Now God always likens his prophets to eagles. And what was it? Moses was his messenger. and they were following Moses and that was the eagle's wings that they were carried on because he was packing God's message and the people followed that they were following God as they followed Moses with his message of deliverance and the Bible said and he they perish not with them who believe not because God was rich in mercy to him because they were following his commandments. God wants us to follow his commandments. We could say the same about Kora and about Dayan and their gang of unbelieving uh people as they tried uh to impersonate. They tried to to inflict something into God's program. They didn't like a one-man program. They didn't like that. They had to have something to do. Kora said, "Well, there's more holy man than you, Moses. you act like you're the only beach on the or the only pebble on the beach rather and said I you ought to do that and there's more man here and Moses know that he was to carry those children over into the promised land because the promise was given to him and he must pack them to the promised land and today the Holy Spirit is here to vindicate God's word and that's the eagle wing that we're supposed to ride on not some manmade theology, but we are to ride upon the wings of the eagle to the promised land. And here they was going to get a bunch of chickens out there. Corora thought, you know, to come around impersonate this the eagle. And when they did, God said, "Separate yourself from them." And he swallowed up the world. He would have swallowed up the whole thing, the whole creation. But God was rich in mercy to those who are trying to follow his word always. God rich in mercy. Many of them come over on the side with Moses and God opened up the earth and swallowed up the unbeliever. He the unbeliever will always perish. Those who did not believe though they come out and walk for a while but they Jesus said there are everyone dead. Dead is annihilation. They are dead. Just think of them. They come out, seen the miracles of God, seen the great hand of God, enjoyed the mana, and got out there and listened to a man named Balum that perverted the way of God by his teaching, contrary to the word. We're all brethren. So, let's just all get together. That's a another Balum system rising up today. Let's all get together. It will not work. Amen. Let's walk with the eagle. Amen. Jehovah eagle. You're eagle. There's only three saved out of the entire group. Moses, Caleb, and Joshua. The rest of them perished in the wilderness. Jesus said so in St. John the 6th chapter. God in mercy would not let them perish because with the rest of the unbelievers, they all died right there in the wilderness and they are dead. God saved Moses and the eagle believers because they had respect to his word. And today, friend, the only way that we can ever have favor with God, God's rich in mercy today, but we've got to respect what he said about it. You just can't take what somebody else said. You've got to take what God said. He said, "Let every man's word be a lie and mine truth." Today we're told that all you have to do in many places is join church, have a creed or something like that or say a prayer or put your name on a book or be a sprinkled or baptized a certain way or something like that. That's all you have to do. But that's wrong. To be an eagle of God, you've got to follow the word day by day. You've got to continue to feed upon the word. Now, we find them after this time murmuring again, weakening in faith after God had showed mercy to them. And we find them murmuring with God. And when they did, they were dying with snake bites. Well, they deserved it. They certainly did. Anybody that was uh mistake God's word and do these things that they did, they deserve to die. Every one of them desire deserved to die in the wilderness. But when they were so sick that even Dr. Moses and none of them could do anything about it and they were dying by the thousands. But God rich in mercy. He made a way of escape for those who would believe him. Hallelujah. He made an antidote for it by sending up a brass serpent. God and his rich God made a way of escape. So his believing children could be healed. God's interested in everything that's wrong, everything that you're anticipating, every walk of life. God is interested in you. You are his child and he's rich in mercy. He wants to do for you. The people sin later by taking this same thing that God had made an atonement for them by the brass serpent which represented sin already judged and they idolize that gift and that's sin again. God will not share his glory with nobody. Therefore, we can't have no two, three, four gods. There's only one God. He'll not share his glory with anything else. He's God alone. Hallelujah. So as the heathens have many gods, we have the one God and he will not share his glory with another. Neither will he let anything be an idol in front of him even though he had made an atonement for the people. And it was God's word. It was right. But when they become to idolizing that then they got in trouble. Now that's just the same thing I think has happened to our church ages. God sent us the message of Martin Luther with his message. John Wesley the Pentecostal message. But what do we do with it? The very same thing that they did with that brave serpent. We idolize it. I belong to this and I belong to that. You see, you belong to something without the sincerity that's connected with genuine godly worship of the word. What happened? The Bible, we're told in the Bible that the prophet took that idol and destroyed it. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes. What we need on the scene today is a prophet that will destroy the idol of denominations that thinks they're going into heaven upon belonging to some creed or denomination needs to be destroyed. Burn up, throw it away. God is full of mercy. He's rich in mercy in the day that when we would have all been in that chaos of darkness out there. But God rich in mercy has sent us the real genuine Holy Ghost with his own interpretation to it right here in the building every night. Hallelujah. God rich in his mercy. How wonderful we find him to be. Yes, sir. Now, all they thought they could do was to just go to this snake or this little uh thing that God had made out there had Moses to make and hang on a pole and they could be healed without any sincerity. They just stood and look at it and they've got to idolize it. And God sent a prophet along and destroyed it. Now, all that refused to look at that serpent in the wilderness, they perished. Now, God makes a way, but if you refuse to look at it, if you'll sit across the street, if you'll hold on to some creed and refuse to look straight into the word and see whether it's right or not, all that refused to look, they perished. And God is an everchanging God. And all who refuse to look perished. So is it today the same thing then the people sin later and as they've always did and made the idol out of out of it making it a get trying to get healing without sincerity and they belong to something the way we do today. And now we see then the difference of it was that God it was a good atonement a good sign for that time that time it was all right but it was just to be for that time for that journey that's all it will work for that journey and the message that Martin Luther brought of justification was all right for Luther's age that's as far as it went sanctification was fine and Wesley's age. That's as far as it went. Then we come into the Pentecostal age and the restoration of the gifts is a very fine thing. It was fine in the age, but we're going beyond that now. We're beyond that. This assures as a world, we've got to become beyond this thing because we have done the same thing with it that they did before. Make an idol out of it. I belong to this order of it. I belong to that order of it. God will send somebody that'll smash the thing and tear it to pieces and confirm his word, the full word. Notice, praise be to God. Amen. Now, we see that that's true. God rich in his mercy. Then when the prophet destroyed this, it left them without any sign of healing of an atonement because their idol was destroyed. But God rich in mercy made them another one. And what did he do that? It troubled water at the pool at the temple. And many come and was uh healed by stepping into this water. Jesus came down to this same pool and saw a man had been laying there for a number of years waiting for the troubling of the water. See, God rich in mercy. Although they idolized that thing, although the prophet had to tear it up, God made another way for them because he's rich in mercy. He wants them to be healed and he made a way for their healing. Now then that went on. The world become more sinful and more sinful all the time. And finally the world got so sinful that God could have destroyed it. He said in Malachi 4, "Unless I come and to smite the earth with a curse, he could have done it." Just a question. But then God rich in mercy. He sent forth a savior, Jesus Christ. He sent forth Jesus to be both savior and healer. For he said, "As Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up for the same purpose. He the atonement." That's what we have claim upon. Nothing but the atonement. What Jesus purchased by his blood, that's what we have claims upon. And the Bible said he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquity. The chasm of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes we were healed. That's what we can claim because that's what the atonement that we stand for ordered for us. God rich in mercy. This was to be an eternal atonement because he came himself. God came himself in a form of sinful flesh to make a a a an eternal atonement and suffered in the flesh and made the atonement and returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement where no brass serpent and no troubles water could do it. It all pointed to that perfect atonement. God rich in his mercy has did this. Now today being it's the day that we're living in, we have come through these church ages and explained everything away from that. Our theologians of the day has far lost that side of it. They explained it all the way to some other day, some other age, some other something way back from long ago. And divine healing was just about played out. Hardly found anybody who would believe it. They made fun of it. Not no more than about 20 years ago. They were making fun of it. The Pentecostals had practically got away from it. They started in the early days, but they got away from it. Look how they did now. They got denominational while running out to make them each a creed and so forth. They accept instead of accepting light as light come in, they organized and made themselves creeds. Each one coming around making himself a doctrine and staying in that doctrine. And then they got so much took away till the Holy Spirit couldn't get into the church. They just become another idol like a brass serpent. It become an idolatry. Every fellow said, "I am belong to this and I belong to that." It was an idolatry. What a mess we were in at the end time. But God, rich in his mercy, has sent back the Holy Spirit upon us and vindicating his word tonight as he promised he would do. God promised he would do these things. Look what he did.
