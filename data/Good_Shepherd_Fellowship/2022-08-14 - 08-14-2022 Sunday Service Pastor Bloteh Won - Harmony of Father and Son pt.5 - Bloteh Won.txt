a little bit here i don't have voice amen praise the lord praise the lord amen amen amen now i thought we would do that some refining fires but i don't have voice this morning so i don't know praise the lord hallelujah [Music] amen and let me let me do something here i remember now [Music] praise the lord good to be in the house of the lord this morning amen you know i was i was uh how to talk to the day comes yesterday but i was here a little bit early and kind of for just worshiping and praying and and uh committing some things to the lord and i taught about uh i thought about hannah this uh there's a song that uh uh is just few chorus from from hana prayer to the lord in uh first samuel chapter two and uh a little chorus we used to sing back home uh he's the lifter up off my head you know when the enemy tried to pull me down in shame so i was thinking that and uh and then i i said i i wanted to look for it and i went looking in the scripture but then i came across another chorus that's first samuel chapter 2 verse 2 and uh which of course first samuel chapter 2 verse 2 reads there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any like our rock and then i put the last verse there because it repeats again that's how the chorus repeats uh i don't know let me try my voices and see if i can and sing it now there is no there is no holy eyes the lord for there is no decided neither is there's any rock like our god there is no holy as the law there is none holy as the law for there is no be such thing neither is there's any rock like our [Music] there is no [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh there [Music] for is is [Music] [Applause] [Music] for there is no [Music] let's give the lord a hand of praise hallelujah once again reaches heart in the name of the lord jesus amen praise the lord uh thank you musicians that will be that'll be all for now and uh if we think another song we will call you up so we think amen praise the lord hallelujah amen you know every every uh preacher in a sense has a way of getting rid of their nervousness my own is to sink when i start singing it helps me to get rid of my nervousness praise the lord the lord bless you you can have your seat for a while amen praise the lord hallelujah amen all the faces are familiar praise the lord so uh there is one guest that we never get tired we're coming is the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord he's always welcome he's most welcome and again now we'll i will welcome a brother joseph moshota then his wife and and the reason why i'm doing that is because brother moshert has sent me a message that the next time i see him in church he's a visitor and so i want to make them to feel welcome and i don't take those things lightly i take it very serious because i believe we don't come here to play games this is the house of the living god and i'm not yet to play games i told you people before i'm not running a liberian church i'm not running an african church i'm running a bible-believing church by the message of the hour [Applause] this is not a family thing praise the lord so i will tell you brother joseph i respect your opinion and i accept it and for the fact that [Music] i gave you uh you know an opportunity to this puppet as a preacher i would take that back and you as a visitor i will treat you as a visitor in a way that we treat all of our visitors and and then because i believe that a man must thoroughly pray that's why brother branham said choosing a bride you know you must pray to be able to choose your church and be able to choose whoever is your pastor uh brother joel traveled from south africa you know uh uh marry my sister-in-law and came i mean you had you had a right to choose anywhere in the u.s to go i didn't you know call you uh you know as a ministry you came and then uh i mean this is the local church we've been here for some ride and and uh even when we moved here with this church i took four years to even accept to be a pastor of this church and and i'm not going to get on any kind of for intimidation from anybody i don't know where you met the lord i don't know how the law called you like i've told you i inherit this church and i respect the people that i met here and some of you that travel here i inherit you also you know the thing about inheritance you got to be careful because sometimes people don't value inheritance solomon said it inefficient i mean in ecclesiastic he sees a man labor and he labored and all that he labored for he leave it unto others and they wasted it because they didn't label for it praise the lord so i respect your your choice of uh whatever you want to do i think he told me he's putting an altar in his house so we might have a church in uh rosemount shout out assembly and we'll be glad to to support or work with you if you wanna stall and uh praise the lord i mean there's i mean they're just a little few things i could say to had almost four hour meetings with the deacons yesterday uh delivery uh talking about these things and some other things that we have to talk about i believe that even as a church we have come to the junction we have come to a junction and as i've taught you before and and teach from the word brother branham said in junction of time and just imagine the angel of the lord woke brother branham up and gave him a message for the church that's what he said he says at night the angel gave me this message for the church he says at the junction at every junction he said there are two things that happen he says the enemy coming as a flood but the spirit of god also raised up a standard now what we have to watch as individuals in our lives and and also in whatever we do is that sometimes we get overtaken when the enemy come as a flood and then we don't we don't because of our human nature we don't get to identify that the spirit of god is there to raise up a standard so we get carried about with all the you know uh things that are happening around our life whether it is sickness whether it is financial problem whether it is whatever problem it is even what is the church problem but this is what the prophet of god said and i will tell you that i had a blessing preaching this in zimbabwe because those people know how to pull out of you and uh this is what the prophet of god said uh when when that is happening there he says when the people identified the spirit of god that is there to raise up his tender he says they move into the miracles because the only potence is there to do the miracles he said but if the people don't identify it that goes into judgment praise the lord now brother branham in that message identified seven dispensational junction the seven junctions that he identified in that message they are dispensational but they are not the only junction we have even in your own life you have junction every seven years you come to a junction and there are things that happen around you in your health you come to a junction even in a church we come to a junction do you know that there are some times where the church is is just under god just pulled the anointing of the ox on the church sure and at that time the church goes from one problem to another problem do you know that yes sir that's right that's right sometimes the church is under the eagles anointing revelation and things are happening well that's what we like but god also work with four different anointing [Music] praise the lord so just like i said brother joseph i respect your your choice and i will tell you that uh uh i sir as a brother you know uh brother-in-law with that one we will solve it out of the church right now his brother in christ amen brother-in-law relationship is out of the church right now his brother in christ and as far as i know until few minutes i'll stay the pastor of this church i don't know if he has changed and with some of the things that i pick up from the deacons of you standing right in the hallway there and making comment that i'm trying to trash your ministry and trashing other people ministry setting them down i don't even have confidence to allow you to pray behind my puppet i'm telling you that right now to your face i don't have confidence to have you come behind this puppet and pray because as far as i'm concerned there is nobody in this church i'm trashing down church is not wrong like playing cards we don't play shuffle cards and choose who to preach it's not a spinning table jordan you preach today that brother dan you preach tomorrow then uh brother jose you preach it does not run like that that's not how church operates and i'll say to many of you young brothers you better go to school learn and get a career the moment you start picking a bible to read the first thing you're start looking at the pulpit so when they say come and give testimony you now can take one whole chapter to read i was reading this scripture it was on my heart you better go to school and look for the holy ghost so now you start reading bible then then now you have you have something on your heart you want to say it to the church and i won't take all the church time on those things because there are other things that i have to deal with this morning but uh i just want to say that to our brother because i thought that it was necessary for the church to let me to know and now being a member of the church you have a choice of where to send your tithe if you don't trust my ministry i don't feed on your ties i don't feed you on your ties so find a place if you send it to this church we have missions we have offerings and the trustees will choose to do it deal with that but i've told the trustees in this church if a man do not respect what we are doing here i i don't want i don't i don't feel on the amenities on the money because i'm not here for money praise the lord a couple of weeks ago also uh when the the we got to the lockdown and different things that were happening i told just before we could come back to church we gathered the brothers here and to discuss on how we were coming back and upon their decision were made we're going to wear max we're going to get sanitizer and everything that we decided to do and then few of the brothers were choosing to help the deacons brother stephen wolves brother johnny and and also brother joseph was asked to which of course i was there if he feared that it was not his calling to do it maybe his calling was we need to preach but that was fine and but these brothers were asked to help the deacons in ushering you know making sure people use the sanitizer you know helping the cars in the parking lot you know just just because we have a very small space and we just wanted to manage and make sure that we keep in regard of what uh the state was requiring us to do as a church so we brought all these brothers on board and then when we when we came back uh uh you know the brothers were were serving us i remember a couple of times uh our brother uh uh brother scat bless his heart he will always uh love to encourage couple of times you call brother johnny oppa you know even having to leave songs in order there and uh [Music] you know and as as as as a pastor i knew you know uh uh at that time that those some of those things were very good for our brother because i knew what he was going through personally and we you know there was there were time we we we met here a couple of times in the week and uh you know uh and different things that we had to deal with so uh and yeah and then he saved the church throughout that time until we are where we are now so in that light he and brother stephen woods have always uh uh hang around and help the deacons out there you know putting people in seats and doing different things what we want them to do and but a couple of weeks ago brother johnny traveled and which of course he told me he was traveling and there were there were some other things today and i'm not yet to go into the details but i i'm just only want to bring this to you because as we are living in the in the world there where uh information is just all around us i believe that we have uh the god-given responsibility to be able to protect the image of this local assembly in a sense of what what we believe what we stands for praise the lord i believe that the church is just like jesus said about the good samaritans and uh uh is is uh is a place that is just like an in or a hospital where the law by the spirit you know will lead people to come in and we all you know there is there is one thing that is common in the hospital is that i don't know what it is but what's designed but you know those hospital dresses for some reason they're always tied to the back okay everywhere is covered in the back so we all have a spot on our back that is open and so i believe that's the way the church age you know our doors it's a revolving doors we have our people that have come in and have gone and we always try the best that we can to accommodate people that we were coming in but yet instead we we must not step down the standard of the word just because we want members no for no reason for nobody are we going to step down the standard of the word no no people come we talk to them and we we you know get to know them and we let them know you know brother if this is the situation you know i will i will let you know that five brothers people that have traveled through this church before you know some of them travel to the states and and uh maybe it's on a dv program diversity visa and and uh maybe they had to to to get into some kind of a marriage situation for them to travel when i know about that i make you know directly what the word of god says i said well maybe you did not know but you traveled for this reason but uh i mean because those are things that take that that people take lightly they take it lightly and i hope i can share some things to you there's with you this morning uh which of course is not really what i want to preach on but uh i'm obligated to share it to you because it's the word of god and uh so i tell them i let them know this is the situation i will tell you if you as long as you stay in this local assembly i can never move you to an office the reason because of this if you had to travel for this reason i mean you join yourself to someone as well as a husband to travel you put yourself under on a law of polygamy you have put yourself under the lord of polygamy and i always set them down we talk about it nicely they will ask questions i will i will show them places in the scripture you know uh uh you know look at this look at this and look at this thing and i've by the grace of god we have had you know uh a success in talking to many of these brothers that never knew that uh you know that the word of god takes the coveting of marriage very serious for the matter of fact i think you heard the the the tag team playing a man running away from the presence of the lord uh you remember i promised you young people i was going to talk on on some things concerning and uh marriage and other days so i told brother jordan if their team can play us the entire series towards marriage and divorce and and if you have time you go back and you can read it personally you can study it but we're going to go through that series as the holy spirit will lead us and brother brandon preached a couple of messages before he preached marriage and divorce this morning i was just listening to the seed it's not held by the shock he said in that message i'm laying the foundation for what i will say on sunday so he first started preaching a man running away from the presence of the lord you studied that message brother branham make it it's a quote he says marriage is responsibility so he brought that message to show the kind of a responsibility that was lying on his shoulder as a prophet of god to be able to deal with the marriage question of this age he had that responsibility that's why he went to finger mountain to get an instruction from the lord what to say it's not a game marriage is not a game it's a responsibility after then he preached a message the seat is not held with the shock on in that message brother brandon picks up the three women that the seed of abraham passed through but yet what he taught in that message that is attached to the marriage covenant is uh he taught that actually this is for women when he gets to marriage in davos then he brought he brought eve into the picture but under the seat is not held with the shark because he was talking about the moving of the seed of abraham showing to us that the promised seed that god promised abraham was not isaac it was the lord jesus christ which is the royal seed and honor that seed we have the blessing of abraham so he showed uh sarah as the free woman but he said she doubted the word of god and he showed uh uh hager as the bound woman that was also brought in the promise now this is this is what where brother brennan brings brings a hager into death because he's going to show us that there was a second covenant after the fall and that second covenant introduced polygamy which he said was legal at that time so that's where hagar comes in to this praise the lord then he talks about mary which was the virgin bride of the virgin uh uh you know womb that the seed came true and then the prophet of god uh will preach um this day this scripture is fulfilled which of course i believe knowing the responsibility that he had he was going to tie his ministry to the same as moses god's choosing place of worship was the next message he preached and then he did a wedding in the afternoon that was on saturday sunday he preached marriage and davos in the evening he preached who is this matrices day so i just told i had on my mind that we were going to to to go through that message especially as i would be picking here and there to talk to to the young people and encourage them and see most of our young people young adults preparing their mind for marriage and [Music] and all of that so so we're going to go through that and by the grace of god you you come elliot on sunday you will hear the tape play you can read it back home and then follow up in church and whichever way that the lord will be able to lead you to do it but getting back to our our need here so uh we uh uh talked to brother uh johnny before he traveled and then uh based on our conversation uh when he traveled and i i came to find out later you know from some of the pictures that he posts that he have already done a wedding which of course you know he and myself we did sort of talk about that he thought he told me he was going to do a wedding and no that was not a conversation that we had so [Music] i thought that i needed faith to to uh you know uh talk to our brother and make him to realize that you know that is uh a choice that you have made but based on what we as a local church believe in we will remove you from the office of of of usher even though is not a voted office even though it's not a biblical office but you have the responsibility of people so we won't have you doing that again and and you know which of course also i know some of you might have seen the pictures on on facebook and all of that and you know how things goes you know when those things happen the people don't hear nothing in church and it just looks like oh i think the pastor is okay with that so based on that that's the reason why i choose that i will take this time and address the church and make the church to know you know i i i like just like i told brother johnny right on my way back i took i took a time after getting some nap on the flight took my time and looked through every quote that brother bram talks on on polygamy i'm not going to preach on polygamy this morning don't worry about it and uh but what happened is that uh there is a statement i was looking for and i think i heard brother branham saying it uh somewhere here um uh there's a statement i was looking for i wish i would share it with you i think that's very insane in a year he talks about this oh praise the lord okay yeah he talks about this in the seventh week of daniel he says in the nations where they have polygamy it's a thousand times better and yet polygamy is wrong we know but just show how degrading now he's he's comparing that with the the loose immoral life okay that even though those people practice it there but those women are they are committed completely different from a woman that is just loose i mean with with every man that comes away it's completely different that is what he's referring to now but what caught my mind was you know he says polygamy is wrong now over the years i've had this view where the uh you know you talk to brothers and and it looks like we we try to dismiss the thought of polygamy without rightly showing how it's wrong now a paul says a bishop should be a man of one wife the reason why he said that is because of polygamy the reason why they come to be a man of one wife is because of polygamy does not means that the man should have one wife at home but if he was ever married before he comes to the faith that's right if he was married and maybe he he put away his wife not nor ignoring the word and god married again and he comes to the faith well it's his faith in jesus but when it comes to the order of the local church he cannot be a bishop he cannot be a deacon so what is forbidding him is the law of polygamy so do we believe in polygamy you see it's a very tricky tricky subject amen if we will hold to this to this if we will hold a brother accountable that uh uh he should be a man of one wife if we will hold him but then which of course is based on the lord of polygamy praise the lord then we believe in polygamy now i think most of the time the sense there is that when the question is asked do we believe in polygamy what goes in people's mind is that do we practice it do we agree that it's wrong for the fact that based on the lord of god a man will not be able to assume an office in the local church yeah we hold to that principle are you getting where i'm coming from with this we don't believe it to practice it to live it out but we believe it to guide ourselves because it's the law of god are we together and uh so i i uh you know i've i taught that i was going to bring this to the church and uh just speak on some few things here and uh people goes through you know uh uh situations in their lives you know some before they came to the faith some even while they are in the faith you know different things people goes through but just like i said you know uh if if there is one that ever comes through this assembly unless i don't know you know i mean unless i don't know because i don't believe of having any interest to protect you know uh uh i mean the man cannot be protect protected by any fake leaf amen if i would give you any special privilege to protect you it's just a fake leave don't take it what you need is a sheepskin the word that's what you need so let me just read some few things here and then i will try and get to what i want to preach this morning praise the lord dania i spoke to your mama this morning she would love to witness you being baptized so she asked if we can do it another time i think she was uh called emergency to work this morning so uh we will we will plan to do it either in the week or on the next weekend okay praise the lord i know it will it will it will do her good okay it will do her good your mama has gone through a lot for you so uh for her to stand there and witness you being baptized is going to help her now brother branham takes this where he approached this over in uh mauritian davos now we see them after the beginning we see then after the beginning it was something else was introduced now what he's talking about you you will listen to the tape you can go back and read but he's talking about after god made one man and one woman the bible says the lord blessed him and uh but then he's he's saying here after the beginning there was something that was introduced now this is this is going to shock you are you tired i don't expect you to say you are tired just say still a little longer he says uh then when the double coveted was made by the man and the woman through sex another coveting altogether not the original covenant but another covenant which of course we call it a permissive now what's introduced polygamy in all then after the beginning polygamy was introduced both in man and in peace after the beginning after the fall praise the lord so polygamy came after the fall praise the lord and uh uh so brother branham on a year is trying to make us to see the other this was this was a permissive coveting you know this was a permissive covenant that was given and uh i mean there are some things i can go into here and uh to be able to break this down but it's going to take our time and uh and again it's just it's just important for me to deal with you know what is what is necessary now you notice in in first corinthians 17 notice paul commanded the woman there is that the divorce of husband to remain single or to be reconciled that not to remarry she must remain single or to be reconciled back to her husband she cannot remarry she must remain single but notice he never said about the man see you can't make the word lie from the beginning the sex lord by polygamy now what does that mean what does that mean now the word of god runs true with nature with the nature of god run in to come trinity now so you will see he says but you see uh uh you are a juror if if you want to be talking to the woman and but the desire has to be in you now so what uh what what he's dealing here with is the other he brings out uh corinthian first corinthians 7 which of course brother branham also used that in invisible union and talk talk about it being a prophecy of the church now so what is what is happening here is that he's holding the situation of the woman and i've always said says this and i tried to re-equate and you know uh and emphasize it to to the church because that is the word of god that is the reason the tree sacrifice was given to the woman as i've said before and according to what brother branham said in invisible union it was given to her because of redemption the power of the woman is in those virtues just like if the church keep them spiritually the power of the church in those virtues praying reading commitment to the word now so if you look here you will realize that on the the permissive lord under the permissive lord there was there that was introduced after the fall brother branham emphasize on that it was after the fall amen after the man has lost that holy veil praise lord it was it was it was introduced and now both man and beast had to live live that way and uh but then he comes back yet and then he makes us to realize that because of the the the the sacredness the place of the woman because of the place of the woman she's the mother of all living amen because of that place of life because most of the time when people look into into this subject is it it seems to be it appears like it's an unjust law why should a man have you know uh have the right to to live polygamy and have many women that is under the old testament it's not what we are practicing right it's not right praise the lord because what you will establish and understand here is that polygamy came in in what should be adultery praise the lord that's the reason why when he used uh first corinthians 7 he says if the woman then is adultery but it's the same law of polygamy praise lord now so uh just like i said i'm not preaching on the subject but i'm just trying to to uh make you all know uh i know uh uh brother johnny myself we had a talk on friday it was a good successful talk we look at things in the world i expressed my heart out to him and and you know and encouraging in his own personal faith and walk with god praise the lord amen so uh uh you know you that have your information and you you know you take your time to sit down at the house and just talk about people's situation uh uh you know all about this church you know what brother one is doing i know what brother one is doing and all of that uh i hope you are listening i hope your ears are open because instead of people to sit down and and prayed right they just sit back and and observe and says well i you know yeah if it is this person who are going to talk about it but this other person will not run in favor of testing praise the lord and if there's things that happen in this local church and i don't come on on the pulpit to talk about it it's because i deal with it if i don't believe that it's going to affect us as a church if i don't believe that your habit of putting things on facebook forced me to come on the pulpit because when you finish announcing it to the word then now you make me obligated praise the lord amen if you take you and your wi-fi to facebook i'm going to preach it on sunday praise the lord a lot of things that that becomes very very emotional to me and it is not because of weakness is because of the hours the time that i put behind those things that you don't have no idea about if you think we are just coming here for showmanship just to plot a bunch of quotes and read to you that's not how a church runs that's not how a church runs so if you have any other questions concerning the subject come and talk to me if you have any question concerning the position of our brother come and talk to me which of course like you know what was amazing i was telling the deacons right after the meeting some of the you know some of the people that in zimbabwe are following our service so i think i should just leave this one and preach my message okay i should just leave this one and preach my message i was visiting with the ministers and then uh you know we were talking some things in and they were talking something in the in their language they asked me to excuse them because it was church matters they were dealing with and while i was sitting there something just ministered to my heart and says i think this is what they are talking about and i'm telling you i nailed it right on the head i knew exactly that was what they were talking about because the pastor acts like we hear him talking like well let's talk to the brother and see what he was saying about it praise the lord and that's the faithfulness of god let's stand on our feet this morning praise the lord so brother johnny you know how i feel in my heart about you brother you and myself we have we have had a very good relationship and i'm not going to trash it for any personal gain but with the responsibility that you and myself have to this word of god we we want to remain truth to one another we want to remain truth to one another let's buy our heads and pray heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus christ we calm lord in and approach your word this morning father you know we have a heart with very heavy heart lord i stand behind this pulpit lord jesus with no personal pleasure of god i choose to talk to brother joseph but it was his request a message to the church and father lord gather most especially lord and uh pray for them pray for heal his wife help them lord jesus as steve as he traveled alone pray for brother johnny and his children lord god and ask that your grace will just be with them and father lord i also pray this morning for everyone under the sound of my voice saying these things lord you know the emotion that goes in the hearts of the people you know the things of god that is flapping at your minds oh god look down upon us this morning take the heaviness from over the service let the spirit of the living god rest upon us oh god help us in the area where we are in need we need you if there is ever a time we need you it's right now lord father i'm asking for grace i'm asking for strength and oh god and i'm just asking that you just stepped me aside and uh speak this morning please lord if it is just five minutes that you will say something that will encourage your children we trust ourselves in your hands dear god i pray that you be merciful lord father this morning i try to approach these things lord to the best of my knowledge and i just ask the lord god you will give us grace we love you we appreciate your father in jesus name amen psalm chapter 22 psalm chapter 22. i promise you and tell you that i believe the law really helped me this morning because uh if you were left to myself i would have gone in a completely different way but uh i believe that the spirit of the lord is here psalm chapter 22. can we read it together if the if the technician will put it up for us or read it from your bible my god my god why have thou forsaken me why are there so far from helping me and from the words of my rolling first two oh my god i cry in the day time but that year at night and in the night season and i'm not silenced verse 3 but thou art holy all thou that inhabited the praises of israel first of all our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and now they deliver them verse 5 they cry unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and will not confound it we will stop right there heavenly father bless the words o god to our house now in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seed been talking on the harmony of the father in the sun and i mean that was the only inspiration that was on my heart so i took it all through the meetings there in in south in zimbabwe tokyo the first service the second service and uh and but i thought i could just preach it you know all the the three days meetings but just like i said those people they rub you off all your notes you know you'll just be standing there now amen you just be standing there that's a beautiful thing that uh that uh you know that i observed and and i i did not pay a lot of attention to it but after a while we were having a lunch after one of the service and and the pastor wanted me to address the ministers and their wife talk to them a little bit appreciate them for the work that they are doing and i mean i was just i was i was just so humble to realize that many of those men were preaching before even i was i was some of them i have been preaching before i was born you know i mean all the men and all of that i was very humbled by that but uh uh uh and i was and it was also an encouragement but then after then one of the brother asked me he said brother warner in in west africa are you uh are you is there more of a teaching ministry or a evangelistic ministry i had to pause for a while before i answer him yeah i started running my mind around and says well let me see the general approach so what he was talking about is the approach you go to certain places there is a general approach the general approach is evangelistical so all the preachers turn out to be you know rebuking whatever his pastor is evangelii is teacher you know they go with that approach you know uh uh so it actually make me to think because uh what what i saw uh for for the group of brothers that i was with on the weekend some of them preach some of them you know they did a full running they would come take 15 minutes before the preacher comes what i what i saw was that they had a ministry of putting the people in the promise you know god said i will restore you know he will restore your family he will restore your job he's putting them in the promise and i'm telling you those things take the people from their feet and they are all running to the pulpit all young babies they are all running to the pulpit trying to get their restoration from the preacher praise the lord amen i i i see uh uh uh a little girl there i think maybe about it like the age of redeemed she came to the pulpit and she she had her hands up you know and i'm preaching and i'm preaching and i look at this little i say okay little baby you take what you want you know what then and i just i just appreciate that you know i just appreciate that because there is nothing that we as ministers can do for you just to remind you or tell you that it's already done it's given to you you take it it's yours and we have to identify it we have to identify the blessings in our age it's not me coming and shouting and saying cut your hair this will wear your neck tight this way and that yeah i mean you put your trouser up and then i mean i praise the lord sometimes it's needed sometimes it's needed sometimes the spirit of god goes that way and rebuke the people praise the lord so we were talking about the harmony of the father and his son it's almost 12 30 years so i get 10 minutes to preach to you the harmony of the father and the son jesus said i do nothing brother branham we read this over and over brother branham tagama's church age he says now notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father now so we talk a lot of types to be able to show you david and saul and and how david was like a son now one of the things studying this subject one of the things that struck me was i i got caught up in the the lamentation of of of the hebrews now brother man make us to know that when the hebrew mother cry at birth pain amen she's prophesying over the destiny of her son oh judah she's prophesying over the destiny of her son now and and then he said this lord be to god amen praise the lord now he said this do i have it i pick a quote up that i did sheared where brother branham uh i think i use that okay but what what brother branham said yeah uh he was he was trying to show is that uh he talks of uh the the how those hebrews he says the the the the hebrew fathers at the end how how jacob when he was placing his sons he prophesied amen placing those sons in the exact place of their birth stone which means the the prophecy of the hebrew mother was exactly what the mother prophesied over the boy when he came to the place for the father to depart when he called him he placed them positionally praise the lord now follow me in a little bit here now uh you you can see that he then brother branham referred to genesis chapter 49 where we would go to where joseph was placing all of his sons now what what i want you to see or capture in your mind is that at the time were the the the the hebrew songs you think about uh isa coming back to jacob and realizing that uh uh coming back to isaac and realizing that jacob has taken the blessing and he says is there not is there not no blessing for me i believe that as as as isaac said those last word over easter i believe he was weeping amen he was weeping so what i want to grab your mind here is that if the hebrew mother in childbirth they are also weeping honor they are cry they are prophesying over their sons and the hebrew fathers when they are about to leave and they call their sons to bless them amen it's a southern movement and the hebrew father are also weeping positionally placing the sun in the right place now what i want us to look at this morning is the position of the hebrew songs we saw that david webb the bible said he rent his clothes all daughters of israel don't let them know don't let the philistines know about it praise the lord amen but we find out that in the lamentation of david he says some things referring to the father saul he identified saw ministry he identified the benefit that saw broad to israel he said remember he clothed you he won battles for you he and jonathan they were blessing in their lives praise the lord they were swifter than like like ego they were stronger like than lions so he identified the characteristic of the father because saul was the king of israel he was standing in a place of the father of the nation now we look at elijah and elisha when sorry when elijah was going away when he took up read the scripture now the bible says there was a chariot of fire that came and went between elijah and elisha and it picked elijah up praise the lord such a speed that chariot of fire pick him up with such a speed are we together and he turned he said my father my father the chariot of israel and the husband thereof but we realized that before a couple of days before that experience whether it was couple of days on that after elijah knew that they were coming ring from heaven he told elijah you go out and look at because there's going to be abundance of rain the seven went out and looked the first time there was nothing he went out and looked the second time there was nothing at the seventh time he says i see the cloud like a man's hand praise the lord amen then uh elijah now took the the the uh uh uh uh he went down i like the way brother branham said it yeah let me let me read that he says he said here he said uh in the message look he said watch elijah when he accepted it when he accepted the word of the lord you know his life must have been renewed he had reigned ahab terror he run before the terror when he couldn't even climb a hill in his physical strength he can't even go up a hill but when he had that experience his life changed that he had such a speed to iran the president motorcade praise the lord amen amen he has such a speech so when elisha was crying out my father my father what he saw with his eyes praise the lord a natural man having the speed more than a cherub so he was crying and saying that you are the chariot of israel your ministry praise the lord let's look at it in the scripture when every time the syrians were gathering to attack israel praise the lord was it the army that was defending them or was it was said the prophet it was the prophet because the army israel army they are there you you you you you but they don't know where the army is coming from they don't know where the syrians are coming from elijah wake up in the morning he says boy go and tell the king praise the lord go and tell the king so where is the horseman who was the horseman it was not the natural army that was the horseman it was the ministry of the prophet the ministry of the prophet was the powerhouse it's not the multitude of the people in the church it's the ministry you are setting honor and the ministry is the ministry of malachi 4. [Applause] that's the powerhouse of the church it's not how many armies you have so elijah as a son was identifying the ministry of elijah and said you are the chair of israel you are the husband thereof oh my father you being gone we are dead because nobody to tell the american where the syrians are coming from my goodness praise the lord hallelujah how will we have known serpent seed right right praise the lord how will we have known that right baptism that it is not in it is not only in jesus name but in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] how will we have known that the white house rather is an antichrist how will we have known my father my father the sheriff of israel he was the powerhouse he was the safety of the nation so just like the hebrew mother were prophesied in their cry and the hebrew father where we positionally place in the sun when it comes to the sun when they whip over their father they identify they identify the ministry of the father they identify the importance of the father genesis chapter 50. let's talk in our bibles i wish i had a voice this morning to preach hey amen glory be to god you want to borrow me your voice junior amen [Music] glory be to god there are things that brother branham taught us people i'm telling you this this is not a theological school it's not a theological school that's why the prophet of god said in the church book those faithful men need to be they need to sit down and learn yes it's not just reading bunch of cults this was a message to a generation he says that same harmony that existed between the father and the son is now existing between the groom and the bride is now existing but it just don't come easy it's not just easier for parents and children to be in harmony no the age difference is it's fine the parents want the child to be responsible the child wants to play because the play play is in the chat it's the nature of the child so it takes working together it takes working together you got to work together work together build confidence in the child believing that they are doing the right thing their child bearing confidence in their parents knowing that my parents have a good intention for me so over the years that's how harmony is built it's not built overnight [Music] [Applause] even in our marriages harmony is not built overnight it's not bill overnight i'm your husband you must listen to me [Music] i took a salmon from an old preacher but i have to wait for many years to preach it amen i will tell you the top title because you you you message people you are too smart praise the lord amen amen okay i said genesis chapter 15. i was lost in the little baby genesis chapter 49 the bible says dear jacob give up the ghost amen am i right genesis chapter 49. i read the last verse verse 33 and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons placing them in their inheritance the very thing that their mother cried over them from the beginning at the end the father is pleasing them and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed in the year of the ghost and were gathered to his people chapter 50 verse 1. all the songs are sitting right there he called them one by one and he blessed him the scripture says and and joseph fell upon his father's face he fell upon his father's face and he wept upon him and kissed him praise god and what i can hear by the echo in my ear i hear joseph saying my father my father i hear him saying my father my father you have to realize that he had a relationship that was broken praise the lord and now he has sent for his brothers and his father and they have come down and all in egypt and the father is old and he called his sons and he's whipping ruby about my first born he went into my country did levi talked to this one hesitant he talked to this one praise the lord he said joseph bring me your two boys joseph brought his sons and as he's putting his hands on it he crossed his hands joseph said lord that i said he said he says let it be so son almighty god crossed my head and as he's doing that he's whipping over his sons and they have all witness the bible say he gathered his feet in the bed he laid down and he gave up the cause joseph fell on his death and he's whipping and what i can hear joseph saying my god my god why have they forsaken me praise the lord oh man the bible says and joseph fell upon his father face and wept upon him and kiss him praise the lord and then he instructed the physician let's go back to psalm chapter 22 as we find a place to close here we cannot preach all one night but i prayed and hope that the holy ghost will be able to say something to you this morning this is david on a prophecy saying my god my god why have that forsaken me why are thou so far from me now this this statement this statement is the people that are around david and have saw the many things that he have done there might be trouble in their mind why is he saying this god has been so gracious to him but because it was a prophecy they couldn't understand what it was praise the lord i believe even david himself did not understood what he said because when a man is caught up under the child of the holy ghost you don't process your thoughts as you want him god take complete control amen but i want for us to follow this oh my god i cried in the dead time i die here at midnight in the night season i'm solid but our holy and you inhabit the praise of your people now this is what i want you not to forget our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou deliver them the son can do nothing the son can do nothing except what the father show him what the father reveal what the father does through him so when jesus was on the cross saying my god my god why had that forsaken me he was not crying because he was defeated the sun can do nothing keep that at the back of your mind the sun can do nothing except that which the father revealed unto him jesus was exactly on the spirit of prophecy that was on david when he said when he read the song praise the lord now the position of the son when he's crying out to his father the same way david crying out because saul was there he identified the ministry of saul the same way elijah crying out he identified the ministry of the prophet elijah my god my god why have that forsaken me it was not a cry of despise it was not a cry because he was abundant it was not a cry of rejection it was not a crime of failure but once again the son was identifying something and david said it all yeah in this let's read down a little bit you will find out what was happening our father trusted in day they trusted and doubted delivered him they cried and were delivered they trusted in them praise the lord says but i am a worm and no man i'm a warm i'm not a man man that's a deep saying he says i'm not a human i'm a warm well we get back to that sometimes you see all they that see me alive me just come they shout out the lips they shake their hair saying he trusted oh my god yes the word play out again that is the very important word for any form of harmony you can never achieve harmony without trust praise the lord my god my god why have that forsaken me you know why he said that because he trusted in him sure praise the lord you see there's a trust in a reverse way because god trusted us for this age praise the lord he could have brought you in luther days he can brought you in poor days but he trusted you for this age it's now for us to return that trust back god trusted his only begotten son born of a virgin to take the sin of the world upon his shoulder he was trusted to do that brother branham said he had a choice when he whipped in gogota he had a choice to say i can take this but he knew the father trusted him to go through this in whatever trials you're going through god trusted you and you will never be successful until you return that trust back to him and say god you trusted me i trust you that you will bring me through this amen glory to god praise the lord i know you're sitting down looking at me like some kind of a spectator but that's okay amen i'm not intimidated praise the lord because that is the ground of trust brother brandon said yeah let me pick this up satan's eating i'm almost out of time he says god was so satisfied till he just went back and rested from all his works that's genesis every tree never brought forth tongues and teslas no berry ever come out of town street everything was perfect all seas were perfect everything was kept was in perfect condition then when he went and take a little rest his enemies slip in with a deceit and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children listen now when he put trust in his own child amen he went to rest why because he trusted his son that he will not be deceived that was the harmony between the father and the son it was trust praise the lord amen when the enemy starts sowing distrust among god's people where we become so suspicious of one another that's what the church failed you will always feel on that ground because you are leaning to your own understanding when he starts sawing distrust in the home praise the lord if god don't help you you find yourself in in the divorce court trust is the ground of harmony when he put trust in his own child as you put trust in your daughter when she goes out tonight with a man when you put trust in your son when he has to go with with a drunken boy or a smoking boy praise the lord you don't ask you don't ask your your children when you go to school for their friend's baptismal certificate do you ask them that boy you are bringing bring me his baptism and said let me make sure that he's baptized right you should not be you you should not worry about the boy it must be your son right you must trust him you cannot trust him enough if you don't train him enough so the problem don't come on the child it comes back to you [Applause] you don't have trust because you have not you haven't invested enough oh you ask your husband honey all your work made then you find out whether they believe jesus i just want to know that you're in a safe place because the atmosphere mattered do they believe in jesus are you testifying of the message he put trust in his son that he would not do anything wrong god putting trust in his son when jesus said my god my god he was saying i have trust you i have trust you i have done everything you say reason 22. he trusted verse 8 on the law that he will deliver him let him deliver him is that not what those people say right that he trusted in the lord praise the lord amen glory be to god i'm getting out of time here but you just go there take the whole time and read the sign and see what is happening there and just see what david is dealing with yeah that relationship between the father and the son you know what it's something this this uh uh inspiration struck me one day as i was going to work and i was playing uh a supernatural series in my vehicle and a testimony of brother branham when he built his den room he called brother daughter to help him arrange his dead room and put his guns to the to all the places that he wanted his guns to be and as he was opening you know opening the guns and everything he uh uh you know he said to brother branham he says he says wow he says he says this person should really love you you know because he was a young man that loved to hunt he knew all the the different guns and and everything that uh uh you know brother brandon he says wow this person she read he says but they didn't even put their names there praise the lord and what ram said to him brother bam said he said he said donnie if i tell you that the person that sent me this gun you know uh even though they choose not to put their names there but i know who sent it right praise the lord and uh he said well i can tell i can tell when the post when the post you know office bring a box so i can just look at the box he says i know exactly what it's coming from now the story goes on and and while they were there opening boxes and packing gun brother branham said something and then and brother branham just said well that uh you know uh just like you know uh you know a gun is on its way it will be here it is this gun called the name of the gun the serial number everything and as soon as he finished a mail truck just parked before the house and then says oh there's a car out there he went out there he went there's a box he brought it he opened it exactly what brother branham said i sat in my vehicle i said oh god when you trust a man when you trust when god trusts a man he's not trusting the jains of your parents when he trusted you to be a son of god or a daughter of god he was not trusting the nation you will come from all the family you will be born in praise the lord the bible says because he has put his trust upon him when god pulled his trust upon his son all upon the daughter praise the lord hey people why can't we see it why can't we see it that almighty god that has separated us from our mother's womb and kept us till this time if there is a desire in your heart to serve god who put that desire today who gave you that desire who gave you the test the thing that gave you the crave to be more like god i want to be like god i want to live right who gave you that desire have you ever sat down to think why they don't have it that god will trust you with a desire to long after him and he will sit there for you to just long and not be able to meet that desire and not be able to feel that that longing in your heart you know why you think that way because you don't trust him you don't trust him you are trusting your religious knowledge you are trusting your association and which church you belong to and who's your pastor but if you trust god brother branham said that the deep color to the deep the rest of thee being able to respond if there's a true desire in your heart for god god there is a living god that can grant that desire [Music] because he trusted in me i would deliver him because he trusted me where was where was the secret of something strength he trusted the seven lots the philistines could come anyway and bound him anyway he just need to shake it right praise the lord he never went and put some kind of oil in his hair to grow a raster head [Music] he was born with it it was given to him god trusted him with a divine gift that he's eating in a mess of wrong he's lying with a philistine girl on the bed but as long as you feel his head and know that the seven watch is there almighty god will come down and deliver him amen we have become so theological inclined we fill our mind with a bunch of conditions that you're not giving the holy ghost a will to move in your life you're not giving him a liberty to move to deliver you and set you free because you have filled your mind with a bunch of a religious condition if god put his trust upon a man if god trusts you god trusted a runaway prophet he trusted moses that he wouldn't give him a stick to go and deliver his people praise the lord let the age become evil let sin rise god trusts you to give you the holy ghost to give you the new birth why because he's determined to have sons and daughters in this age no matter how evil they become let the whole world script themselves naked god's children will still be clothed in righteousness [Applause] what are we afraid of what are we afraid of amen are you coming to this church looking at my abilities you have to be trusting in god praise the lord amen amen we trusted the lord that's why we left those doors open and as long as we stay here that doors will remain open they will come in and they will go out look through all the scripture the bible says the pro the father of the prodigal son read the scripture very well he goes and still on the tower looking because he trusted that his son will come home praise the lord that's why parents that are believing for their children the high you have to do just rise up in the spirit just get on the tower of prayer and say i know one day every evening he stands up there and he look he's looking to see his boy coming home praise the lord he knew that he might lost all the money he might lost all the gold and inheritance that he carried but there was one thing that he couldn't lost he was my son he had my blood and my gene in him praise the lord let the musicians come thank you musicians you can come see how we rob ourselves of the blessings that we should enjoy we try to behave as if to say we work for the things that are lying at our feet oh god may i never come to that place i always feel in my heart that grace has trusted me with these people i never take it as self-labor what do i have to boast boss about churches that i can say i live before i lost them to the wall i lost one in liberia i lost one in agriculture those were the ones where i walked down through the street 5 30 a.m i stand in a street corner and preach over a community [Music] as a young man well sometimes i was telling one of the brother we were driving there in harare and someone was roasting corn by the side of the street i told him i said brother can you stop i want some of that roasted corn [Music] so he packed the car he went there he got the guy brought some to the to the to the car he said oh let me look at it oh no let me go there my acid love broth just give me this one [Music] so we were eating it and i told him i said i said this is very symbolic to me it's very very symbolic brother gift is his name i said this we call student food i said i remember as a young preacher all i have as a day food was too roasted corn i had to eat it and sleep i said this is very very symbolic to me it's not because i'm hungry [Music] the harmony of the father and the son [Music] that god will choose to call you as his bride what do you have physically what do you have naturally that you think god is entrusted i mean he's attracted to [Music] we can never have harmony [Music] trust is the key ingredients for any form of harmony you want to enjoy the lord you got to trust him you gotta trust that he knows what you are going through you gotta trust that he knows everything about it and moreover that he's in control you gotta trust that you are never forsaking you are never forsaken you are never abandoned that god is in control whatever he wants to make out of you he will allow the situation just surround yourself in his hands say lord i trust you [Music] i go with it within [Music] oh where he sees me [Music] oh [Music] go with him [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] i would trust him in all my trials i will trust him oh [Music] i go with it me oh [Music] you this afternoon can you trust the lord can you believe that god trusted you that god trusted you can you believe that as a young sister [Music] to have a desire for god wanting the holy ghost and you're not running around and messing your life don't you believe that god trusted you that he dropped something in your heart to keep you until you get married don't you believe that are you going to give in to all the foolishness on the internet and defy the trust of god why can't you see that it's almighty god that is keeping you and i shall make you to dedicate yourself more to god trust god for the baptism of the holy ghost trust god for the better future trust god for the husband trust god for our life in christ you can rely on your own ability almighty god trusted you from the womb from the day you were born that's what jeremiah said from my mother womb he obeyed me he trusted me from the womb and he had kept you till this time son you have to trust god from all the things don't allow me when he leaves me where he leads me [Music] i go with it the way i love to say this also what he feeds me i was [Music] with lord what you feed me now i will swallow cause i go think i go [Music] heavenly father i want to let this group up to you lord father among the goal lord
