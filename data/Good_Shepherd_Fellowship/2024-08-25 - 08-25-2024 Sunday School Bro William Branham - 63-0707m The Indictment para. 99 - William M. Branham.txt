[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] God will never meet with man nowhere else but under the blood when you you turn the blood down then your meeting place with God has been taken away God made his first decision in the Garden of Eden that man would only worship him under the shed blood of the sacrifice and that's the only place that God met with man then and that's the only place that God ever did meet with man and that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice see I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you can forget your differences Roman catholic whatever you might be and will'll come under the shed blood God will meet with both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same ground but otherwise he will not meet just because you're a Methodist he will not meet just because you're Pentecostals he'll meet with you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he only can see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow when you've confessed your sins otherwise you're not there you cannot Fellowship that's the reason that you don't see things happening in the churches they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word right there's only one way God will honor that word you'll never honor that word come and say I'm a Roman Catholic I demand this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptist are Pentecostals you can't do it the only way you can do it is under the mercies of God through his grace is the come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ say Lord I claim the promise then if you really are under that blood God's obligated to that word hallelujah But first you got to be under that blood amen you see it now amen no wonder they can't believe in miracles no wonder you can't believe in the Supernatural no wonder they condemn it the same reason they condemned it back there is the same reason they condemn it today amen they're guilty as guilty can be because only under the shed blood and those who dare some little brother who dares under humility to take God at his word and walk out there and confess his sins and forget all these dogmas and things and stand there under the blood and believe it then they want to call him a fanatic they want to class him as we' say it it's not a good word to use at the pulpit but so that you'll understand he's a Oddball after all aren't we we all oddballs see the believer is an oddball to the unbeliever and the unbeliever is an oddball to the believer so who is the Oddball the farmer is an oddball to the businessman the businessman's an oddball to the farmer see so who is he anyhow I tell you salvation is an individual affair with man and God Alone one individual searching out our own salvation with fear and trembling I know no other basis as a teacher this morning or as a minister from Christ than to lay it down upon the word I cannot place it on anything else now we find there then that only under the blood that God met the worshippers so they met it Jerusalem and Christ is God's provided lamb of sacrifice and today there's only one place that God will meet man and that's under the blood of Jesus Christ anywhere else it is condemned God will never hear it you might do all kind of emotions and all kind of isms and shake and jump and have blood and fire and smoke and everything else but as long as that life isn't compared with the word and God thoroughly identifying that life then there's no need of trying it because you're out and God will never meet it till it comes under the care of that blood that's right so you see in the scripture we've got a Jerusalem the church has it's in heaven a Heavenly Jerusalem where God is God and today it's not under some Creed or something that we try to make it a Jerusalem we'd like the Methodist like to like to make the the Methodist headquarters of Jerusalem the Catholic like to make Rome and and the different places where we have our headquarters we like to make that a Jerusalem but the Bible says that our Jerusalem is from above which is mother of all the Believers now and Christ is God's provided lamb notice how appropriate it was now showing it that Jerusalem had was ceasing when it was in effect until that hour the blood of the Lamb was all right until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done amen there was a new one and the the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing there that they had to do it's right God be blessed for seeing this wonderful Heavenly light in this last day because the churches is doing the same thing today till the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ's word from that on comes the word and the word only from the old Pascal lamb passed away and Christ become our lamb at the day of the crucifixion and the day that the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a Creed in the Ste of the word that's the day the word come into full effect amen am that's just been recently notice secondly first there Jerusalem secondly they they who the Jews the worshippers think of it the worshippers themselves was killing the very one they they claimed to be worshiping could you imagine such a thing as intelligent man that were priest that were trained that had doctor's degree till it probably there they had to come out of a certain generation before or or tribe before they could even be a priest they had to be Levites their fathers as priest their grandfathers as priest their great great great great great grandfathers as priest and they had to live such a consecrated life but one iot against them they'd be stoned no mercy was granted holy certainly but self-made Holiness had to act like that to show their face for their Church inside of them Jesus said you're full of Dead Man's [Music] Bones how I could bring an indictment right there man who know that to be the truth this word to be the truth and will compromise on it to show a face before some organization I have a right to indict him right on God's word notice they the worshippers the man who had looked for the promise a man who had looked for it to years and ages and with nothing to do but in that constant Seminary but they had divided the word according to the teaching of the Seminary and they had missed the very truth of it they the priest the ministry of that day there at their headquarters they the ministry of that day was killing the very God the very land the very one that they claim they were worshiping they were killing and today I indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their Creeds and denominations they're crucifying to the people the very God that they claim that they love and serve I indict these ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days of Miracles is passed and the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted Creeds far I indict them as guilty in the blood of Jesus Christ upon their hands are crucifying AR fresh the Lord Jesus a second time they are crucifying Christ to the public taking from them the things that they're supposed to be given to them and they substituted something else in his place a church stre for popularity there they they the ones who ought to know better if anybody should have know better it should have been their ministers if anybody should know better it should be the clergy of this day if anybody ought to know the the the Bishops archbishops and and ministers and doctors of divinity are to not different but why can't they what a contradiction what have we got before sh but a a contradiction they claim that they worship God and they're killing the Prince of Life they there are they crucified him and here they again do the same thing for he is the word that's what it is only a reflection of the word and that's what he is today a reflection of the word trying to find somebody to reflect himself through and these people keep the congregation away from God and and if there anything happens and it's spoke of in the congregation they condemn it from the platform from the pulpit and say it's fanaticism stay away from it and doing so they crucified Jesus Christ in 1963 and are just as guilty as those guys at the at that day it's an awful statement but it's the truth long that's exactly what they do today and upon this grounds upon the grounds of crucifying Christ upon the grounds of taking the word and taking it away from the people is exactly what they were doing there the very word that God was reflecting through his own son to prove it was and the one that they claimed that they love the Jehovah that had manifested himself by the scriptures done exactly what he said he would do exactly what God said he would do and reflected it before because the love of their Church groups and things like that they condemn the Prince of Life and I condemn the same group today and indict them as guilty before the God by the word of God that they're doing the same thing this generation is indied remember Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever how did they indict him because their Creeds would not accept him and down in their heart they know different didn't not Nicodemus in the third chapter St John well expressed Rabbi we the Pharisees the preachers the teachers we though you're a teacher sent from God for no man could do the things that you do unless God was with him they publicly witness it by one of their renowned man and do because of their Creeds a crucified Christ and today there's not a reader that cannot read acts 238 is same as I can read it and the rest of it is the same as I can read it but because of their Creeds and because of their denominational tickets that they got in their pocket the marks of the Beast that packing around as Fellowship cards and taking those things they crucify to themselves Jesus Christ the fresh and crucifying before the public and blaspheme the very God that promised to do this bringing damnation upon the [Music] race there there are they not the sinner they that is the Church of that day they found found fault with the man who was the word is that right they found fault with the man who was the word now they find fault with the word working through the man and it's vice versa which is in the person that the holy spirit is working through is God's Vindication how did they know he was Christ because his Works prove what he was he said which one of you you can condemn me of sin if I haven't done just exactly what the scripture said I would do and which somebody tell me where a fail somewhere if I haven't showed every sign of that I am the Messiah that I'm the very one that you promised they said well we have Moses We Believe Moses said if you would have believed Moses you'd believe me if you Moses seen my day and desired to to live in this day Moses seemed a far off in the prophets and here you are living right by it and can said you Hypocrites said you can discern the the face of the Skies but the sign of the time you can't discern there it is the sign of the time what did he class him a fanatic a crazy man yeah they found fault with the man who was the word he was the word [Music]
