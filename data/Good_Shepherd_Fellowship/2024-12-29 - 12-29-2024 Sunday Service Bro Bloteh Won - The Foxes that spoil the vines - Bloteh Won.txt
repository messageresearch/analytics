me say during the week and uh so uh I don't know I don't know what you think but uh we will manage it and uh uh I want I want us to put uh just put the song We sang just now up there uh now for for those of you that are sitting here is this light causing any kind of a reflection for you is it difficult for you to see no okay okay now some of the things that uh we we taught on doing uh uh during the the the week thank you sister Naomi thank you yes no it it's okay sister Joy thank you let me let me allow you people to sit down as I keep you keep you here uh you know we've been uh uh we've been managing amen we are all managers that's what stewards are Paul says we are stewards of the Mistress of God so you are a manager and uh uh but we've been very concerned about our our our video quality and uh on the on the camera and also uh the the lighting year has not been enough I know uh uh the technicians uh before I forget all of the young people that are working in The Sound Room back there you are asked to stay for the short meeting right after 7 sister Anette would like to talk to you and uh because there is uh there is a uh technician training coming up so all the young ones that are working back there you are ask to stay right after the service and Tuesday night we will have our all night service and uh at uh 8:00 p.m. we will be seated at 8:00 p.m. some service will start at 8:30 I was talking to brother Lawrence yesterday about the service and uh I said well we'll start at some service we start at 8 830 and maybe we'll have uh maybe about an hour uh of praise and worship so when I saw him leading the songs after uh 11:30 I said I wonder he think he's singing an hour this morning let me go up there if not uh maybe I miscommunicate myself amen so uh so that's the service for Tuesday night we will have uh uh uh our end of the year service we want to come and give thanks it will be a service of Thanksgiving so uh uh we are all invited and uh that's what I had have for OPP uh announcement good to see you Jour praise the Lord good to see you oh yeah good to see you sister Sasa is your husband here okay yeah okay he text me this morning and uh uh I saw his text and but I just I just thought I'll talk to him after okay so U and we want to thank the Lord also for helping our sister she had to go into the hospital for something that could have led her to a surgery but the Lord intervene and and uh good to have her in church praise the Lord so uh uh uh yes as I was saying we've been having we've been kind of a struggling to uh make our images better uh the the team back there to try to you know try to play with the color and all of that and sometimes when I I look at some of the service it looks like the pillow of fire is here because the pullit looks so gold you know it just looks so good like it's unfired you know so all of there so we were just thinking on what to do and we thought that maybe our lighting here was not enough so we put an additional light here that's the reason why I wanted to know if it was not causing reflection for you sitting there and then also we uh uh decided to change their poopet color uh a little bit and uh and some other few things that would done which of course the guys have to finish uh maybe tomorrow uh or so and uh but uh we we want to thank the trustees for for uh making it happen brother Max and and uh brother Jordan brother Steve cassid thank you brothers and uh uh what can we say what can we say yesterday uh I I came over here like I would normally do to just come in and uh uh studied a little bit but I have I end I had to start working with the guys because it was it was a little bit noisy and I was just thinking in my mind what am I going to preach tomorrow now that I don't have nothing to preach I have a whole lot but uh this is the last Sunday of the year is the last Sunday Tuesday will be the last service of the year and I just thought that I must use this time uh uh to be to be grateful praise the Lord amen I was trying to do everything and I was telling the devil don't make me mad I don't want to preach angry tomorrow I just want to be very nice and you know and very quiet and just and just be grateful but uh we want to thank uh each and every one of you and uh like I said the year has been a tremendous year tremendous uh uh not only in the sense of uh uh all of our blessings but we are also grateful to the Lord for all of our trials amen they in the midst of uh through everything we are stay standing we are stay here amen those doors are stay open and we still love the Lord above everything so uh uh we want to be we want to we want to be very grateful we want to thank uh uh uh each and every every family they direct your prayers to this place you pray for us you pray for what is done here and uh and we are very grateful we don't we don't take it lightly uh it is it is very dear to our hearts and because we believe that uh uh in every generation God has a people amen one time when Elijah the prophet thought that he was the only one that was left God reminded him that there were 7,000 that have not bowed down to Bell amen and God will always have those people amen God will always have somebody that is taking his word serious God will always have somebody that is uh uh doing everything that he can do to live truth to his word so we we want to be grateful you know we want to be grateful that we have a community of uh of of Brethren of like Precious Faith that's the way Peter will say it in the Bible that we are of like Precious faith we we we turn to have the same value and uh and uh and one thing that we value beyond our nationality Beyond uh uh our ethnicity one thing we value is the word of God amen so we we are very grateful we are very very grateful and uh I want to say thank you to each and every one of you and uh uh our deacons brother brother Ben is stay overseas and uh uh we pray that the Lord will keep him as he attend to some Family Matters and be back home and uh brother Dan uh our trustees uh brother Steve brother Jordan brother Max we want to thank you Brothers for for all of your your work your your support we want to thank our musicians and know brother Ariel and his uh parents uh out way this weekend but uh uh uh s Naomi and the girls and we we just want to thank each and every one of you and our our technicians back there sister aned and in the group back there and uh brother Jordan has not gone on retirement yet but uh I think uh you are doing a good job sister in it praise the Lord whatever you're having going on back there uh the light is stay on so everything is good amen I told her the other day we were talking in the office and uh I told her I says uh if you come and tell me that you don't know what you are doing you will surprise me because I think you're doing a good job and uh uh yeah so but we just want to we want to be grateful like I said we want to be grateful uh to to each and every one of you for all of your support and all of your prayers and uh uh we pray that uh we don't know what the coming year is bringing but whatever is bringing we want to be ready to fix it amen amen amen we want to be right there ready you know to be able to face whatever the year is bringing so that's the reason why we want to encourage ourself this morning in the word of the Lord you know that God uh uh in his in his Mercy would just uh be with each and every one of us and uh uh couple of weeks ago uh which of course I T I will have used that to speak on uh uh as a as a as a Christmas message when I started speaking on U the foxes that spoil the vine and it just couldn't leave my mind uh as I was trying to to just find something to just encourage us up it just keep on my mind so I I would just take my time even before we go through the word this morning to just to just go through some few things like I said uh this morning is just to be able to appreciate uh each and every one of you and then also to encourage us to encourage us because uh uh as the year goes on we uh they are there are different things we beginning to see that is happening around the Christian church that is also happening around the message of the hour and and uh and it's our responsibility to to make you aware of those things and uh and also encourage you to take sides with Jesus to take sides with the word stay with the word praise the Lord amen and uh uh so just before we go to the reading of the word this morning uh if they take back they want to put uh this uh uh that quote on the Ephesian Church age is is part of my notes it's the last one uh on the Ephesian Church age that is something that we have we have read here before and uh but I just want to read that again and uh uh have you ever studied the history of Revival now a Revival signify a move of God in power it signify a move of God in power praise the Lord amen in in every way even Even in our in individual Liv when you are having a Revival is when uh you are you are experiencing a move of God in your life something that is beyond your control but you realize it is God that is that is dealing with you amen so it's a move of God empowered and every time God moves Satan is there to move also it never fails praise the Lord in the days of the Welch Revival and most people don't know this the insane as salom fill up quickly and there was a great display of demon power to take away the attention from God I have a book in my in office and that book was written by a guy that was part of the azuza Revival he was there he was wri in California when the Revival started Thea Revival started from what was happening in Welch from this from this wsh revival and uh uh uh there was a move of God that was taking place there and and uh the you know the people were experiencing uh the move of the Holy Spirit and some people left America and went to that Revival and and then they came back with an Evidence you know that is it's a trueu move of God you know the power of God is experienced among the people and when they came back uh you know uh uh they started giving themselves to praying they were praying and you know wanting God to do the same thing that he was doing down there in Welch and uh uh and with with uh lot of prayer and dedication uh God started to to visit the people they started seeing the move of God so he wrote and and and uh uh some things he said are very similar to this that just at a time where they were experiencing uh the move of God the the gift being birth among them at the very same time they were experiencing you know demon powers now the demon power that they were experiencing it was not coming in a sense of people you know uh uh uh uh yelling and people you know uh throwing things at them it came right in the sense of the very same people that were in church you know uh uh uh and that that were praying and you know that was wanting to experience God it came in a place where there were a lot of impersonation there were a lot of impersonation what was happening is that unconverted spirits will being uh affected by the spirit of God that's the reason why a man can uh whether speak in tongues or even preach the gospel you know and it can sound so anointed so inspiring but if he's unconverted that very man will leave from right behind the pull pit and go and get drunk and run around with women you know and and live wrong it's all because the spirit is unconverted when Saul in the Bible went up to meet Samuel the Bible say the spirit of God fed upon him he started to prophesy and the people said it saw among the prophets it was strange nobody knew this man to be a prophet and here said he started prophesying why because he came in he came in an atmosphere he came in a place where the prophet Samuel was and the spirit of the Lord fought upon him so these people that were experiencing this you also have to remember in the book of Acts the Bible talk about the seven sons of CIS uh that uh that said uh you know Paul we know when Jesus we know you know that went to to cast out people I mean cast our evil spirit you know and the evil spirit had to beat them and strip them naked and run them out in the street is all because they were trying to use unconverted Spirits praise the Lord now so that was what was happening with with uh with this experience of people and most of these people that experience that they end up in the insane aalum they took them into you know uh insane Institute why because they were they were they were Beyond them themselves they were doing things that uh I mean the I mean they just couldn't recognize now so you know uh I've been thinking about that you know it it brings us to the place uh for us to to recognize that uh uh each and every one of us from myself and every one of us that uh you know you know that are here this morning with our Earnest heart wanting to serve God and uh you know wanting to Worship the Lord you know it bring us to the place where we have to we have to ask God for more earnesty and more sincerity in the things that we are doing praise the Lord because one thing that we we we are learning and we come to recognize is that you are more of a spirit being than you know you are more of a spirit being praise the Lord amen when God made man he made man first a spirit being before he put you in a body that's the reason why when you leave the body you go back to your original identity you go back to a spirit being praise the Lord you see see Paul say if this e Tabernacle be dissolved there is another one we will always have bodies this body just like this body we have this one is a terrestrial body but uh uh uh we have a Celestial body there is a glorified body but you see those bodies have to be DED by your spirit is your spirit that picks up the body the body is just like a vehicle if the spirit leaves this body it drops on the ground we are more spirit being then we are flesh praise the Lord amen and you see when the when the when the when the when the spirit of uh of uh of a man or or anybody you know is is exposed to an an atmosphere that is uh that is that is that is stronger uh I mean there can be some impact I don't know if it ever happened to you you go into a place and you just feel funny you don't know what is going on but you just feel funny it just don't look right there is an atmosphere in the flesh that your spirit has sense and it makes you to feel uncomfortable that's that's that's truth there other places you go you don't know what I mean what they are doing there but it just looks like it's okay it's nice are we together and uh and that is the same thing with the the the word of God that is the same thing with the message of the hour I'm trying to take my time to talk to you this morning because I really want to grab your attention on what I want to say that is the same thing with the message of the hour uh all of you young people we are all young people praise the Lord by by sitting on on the message of the hour some of you from birth you know that's that's all you know uh uh I remember I can't remember where I was okay I in in aranson there brother brother preder meeting and I was talking to a brother brother Sam Parker he's Pastor in the church there in U uh wiita area and I was talking to him and you know we were just talking from one thing to another and then I told him well you know I I I grew up in the Methodist Church he was kind of a surprise you know because I mean uh his his parents uh uh uh you know grandparents follow brother brand around and his parents and and then yeah he's also born and I mean all he knows is is uh Malachi 4 Revelation 107 you know uh which of course is a blessing it's uh it's it's a privilege but you see the thing about it there is there are the uh sometimes we have really now come to to recognize what we are dealing with amen what we have been in contact with all of these years praise the Lord perhaps we learned the dress code we learned the languages we learned all of the things you know that been happening around the message but we have not really come to to identify some of the things you know the the the the environment that we have been brought in the atmosphere you know that uh and and by reason of that the reason what I'm saying this because I'm going back to what I'm going to read here but reason of that is that uh you will realize with all of the things that are coming up and all of the things that are that people are doing is because we have come in the presence of almighty God and many people Spirit has not been right with the things that they have come in contact with praise the Lord like he says here uh uh most people didn't know the insane Institute would fill quickly and there was a display of devil powers that was taking the attention from God it is also written in in the Wesley Revival uh the people who do most peculiar things there were definitely of Satan to try to Mark the goodness and the power of God now these people they were not unbelievers there were people that were part of this very same Wesley Revival there were people that were part of the Welsh Revival and I think that's what is happening in our Reigns many people that have sat under this message 40 years how many years you got to remember the Bible says that God called Nebuchadnezzar my Sant he called Nebuchadnezzar his servant he called Nebuchadnezzar to do a work the same Grace when Nebuchadnezzar Mak make sto the calling and think that by his hands he did all of that the same Grace that gave him the power to take God's people into captivity that same Grace kept him seven years eating grass like an animal a whole King he lost his mind praise the Lord I'm saying all of this not to make you afraid but just to admonish you don't play with the grace of God that you have the grace of God that have brought you to know that there is a God forget about Doctrine what you understand but the grace that makes you to know that there is a God in heaven don't play with the grace of God we must not play with the grace of God we have a we have a generation that that that have Mis misunderstood what Grace is the just thing that is a license for them to live a disgraceful life and say we are not honor La we are honor Grace that's not what Grace is that's not what the grace of God is so that's that's just my encouragement to you like I said we don't know what the coming year is bringing but whatever is bringing we want to be standing in the right place and to say by the grace of God we will face it praise the Lord by the grace of God we will face it let's stand on our feet before I take all the time to to uh lecture you this morning let's just read a portion of the word like I said I'm I'm I'm just all over the place but uh I want to I want to bring something to your mind I want to I want to make you to think this morning uh Matthew chapter 11 if I'm right Matthew chapter 11 early this morning I was I was playing the message there a man I can turn on the light and uh it was actually it was actually preached on this day 1963 but uh uh uh Matthew chapter 11 MTH mat chap 11 let's read from verse 11 Matthew 11 verse 11 verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there have not raisen a greater than John the Baptist now with standing he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force are we together for all the prophets and the Lord prophesied until John and if you will receive it this is uh Eliah which was for to come he that have an ear to hear Let Him hear praise the Lord you will hear that over and over in the Book of Revelation because that is how Jesus closed his statement he that have an ear let him hear let's pray heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ once again Lord we have just read your word trying to find a place Lord to to stand and speak to your children this morning I'm asking that Lord you just come and help us Lord help us father as we express our gratitude to you we also Lord father want to admonish ourself that Lord God it is not over until it's over we want to do our best we want to Father God to fight a good fight we want to pick up ourself from the rubbage lord lord god father give us Grace we just want to thank you again come and bless us now in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat this uh this this subject that I'm going to talk to you about U uh uh this year down there in Phoenix I was visiting with brother brother Jordan's dad in conversation we were talking about something I can't remember what it was but uh uh uh this this thing came up and it just it it took a flag to my mind you know it took a flag to my mind and then uh uh uh it make me to start to to look into the subject uh in a different way than I have looked at it before let me grab your mind let me grab your attention I will use something like a bit to grab you and then maybe uh uh it will give me an inspiration to preach verse uh 12 from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take by force this is a verse that has been used in the in the cycle of the carasic churches it has been used in the cycle of churches and uh uh and and the way that this verse has been used it gave us a sense there uh the kingdom of God want us to be violent people use it in the sense that faith is a violent you must take it you must be brave the Bible says since the day of John the Baptist the Kingdom of Heaven suffer violent but just to realize that we have been completely on the wrong side of scripture because it's it is never proven that's what Jesus men and on the basis of the scripture people even perform wiry activities in church because you have to be violent the one that did it to me they they will have to die I I I I can't take it we have completely been on the wrong side of scripture praise the Lord Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violent and the violent taketh it by force the violent take what the violent taketh what look in Luke chapter 16 look in Luke chapter 16 Luke will give his account of uh of their scripture Luke will give his account Matthew was a tax collector Luke was a doctor being the physician he might have been a smart boy look at what he says over in Luke chapter 16 when you read verse 16 the Lord and the prophets were until John I will stop there for for now before I go ahead the Lord and the prophets what does that means it means that John the Baptist closed the Old Testament he closed the Old Testament Malachi was not the last prophet of the Old Testament he's uh he's uh he's re he's he's he's recorded as the last prophet of the Old Testament but John actually was the one that closed the Old Testament the Lord and the prophets were until John God bless you my brother and uh uh so that's what Jesus is saying the Lord and the prophets were until John on and since that time the kingdom of God is preach and every man presses into it once again we've been preach told that the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it so you got you got to find yourself in you got to press your way in if you even got to push your family aside if they want to stop you from entering the kingdom of God you got to put them aside you got to push your way because the the kingdom of God every man presses into that's the wrong side of scripture that is the wrong side praise the Lord because you cannot push yourself into the kingdom you can't press your way he has to call you he's the one that take you in the kingdom of God don't need our violence praise the Lord are we together so you see all of these things has been has been has been preached to the church has been has been put in the head of the people so the the it has put us on the place where it is not uh a life of dedication and consecration to God but it's more of of uh you know H uh How brave we can be that even if we are wrong and doing what is wrong we can still be brave are we together but but what I want us to look at as we study this together let's go back a little bit and look at the context of of of uh of the conversation what Jesus was driving to when when he when he said this when you go back to Luke chap 11 reading from verse one Luke chap 11 reading from verse one and it came to pass when Jesus has made an end of commanding his 12 disciple he departed hence and to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the praising The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples I so where was John where was John he was in prison praise the Lord amen John was in prison you have to remember John when John the Baptist came this was the first uh H uh uh Prophet that preached the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that was John message repent the Kingdom of Heaven is a hand are we together amen now so we see here that John was in prison that is the setting that is the setting that will bring Jesus to make this statement and then we will soon understand what he was saying what is the violence that the kingdom is suffering it's the kingdom that is suffering violence the kingdom is not making you violent the kingdom should not make you violent but the kingdom is suffering violent because Divine things has been put in the hands of mortal men that don't understand it and they try to run the kingdom of God or the house of God just like a political party or they try to run it just like a secular group or so they don't understand all of those things so the kingdom is suffering in the hands of unconverted men praise the Lord that has used uh uh uh uh their places uh uh uh uh in the pull pit to to to abuse the people abuse their mind and and Rob them and and and and it's it's it's something that uh uh I mean it's it's it's very powerful as we look at it together amen are we together I want for us to be able to see this now I read some few things to you here out of the message of the hour but I just want us to to bring us down to this place now when John had heard in prison the work of Christ he sent two of his dis disciple and said unto them and and said unto him speaking to Jesus now are thou he that should come or do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which ye do ye and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk uh the leper I Clans the deaf year the dead I raise up the Paul have the gospel preached unto them and blessed is is he whosoever shall not be offended in me praise the Lord are we together amen now he gave that he gave that message to to the to John disciple to go and tell John go go tell this thing to John and the scripture say and as they departed when they left to go give join the message Jesus now turned to the people that were there and he be to say to the multitude concerning John why when you out to in the wilderness to see a re shaken with wind but why when ye out for to seeed a man clothed in soft Ren behold they that were s clothing in King's houses but what what went you out for to see a prophet yeah I said unto you and more than the prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I sent my messenger so he is he identifying John now with Malachi 3 he's he's telling them that this man that was standing in the wilderness this man that was standing at River Jordan and preaching to you this is this is the scripture that introduced this man amen okay so he's he's telling them now what what you want to see what you thought he was let's let's let's read on a little bit it's good to read the Bible amen for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face we shall prepare the way for thee verily I say unto you among them that are born of uh of women there they have now raisen a greater than John the Baptist now withstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he for from and from the days of John the Baptist until now until now why because he's the one that brought this message of the Kingdom of Heaven is a hand praise the Lord so Jesus is now identifying something here that from that time from the time that that message went forth that the kingdom of heaven heav is at hand the kingdom suffer violence praise the Lord and violent men has taken it by force praise the Lord Violent Men has taken it by force they don't understand it they don't know what it is are we together are you beginning to see the picture praise the Lord now so when you when you look at that the second year is that John is now of the scene he's now being arrested pretty soon he will be beheaded praise the Lord amen Jesus is now coming into his ministry and he pick up from exactly where John stopped and he started to preach repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he came re-echoing the very same thing that John has said are we together praise the Lord now that's a good place to be now I can preach amen can I preach amen now so we will go back and look at uh uh our our prophecy that we look at back in uh Psalms of Solomon Chapter 2 psms of Solomon Chapter chapter 2 when Jesus said you must be born again he meant what he said amen he said it's a must he didn't say you may be he said you must be born again because there's a reason it's uh it's very important the new birth cannot be underestimated it cannot be taken for the church membership it cannot be taken for anything now we were talking in Sons of Solomon Chapter 2 that's where we taking this our inspiration from the foxes that spoil the vine that's what I I want to continue uh uh introduce it one Wednesday night but I want to continue on it year because uh uh this this will give you a picture of uh why Jesus called Herod a fox what has the what are the vine is the fox is spting is the kingdom that is suffering violence Jude that spoke about the apostasy the book of Jude he says men has creeped in Una aware he said men has creep in Una aware Luke says since John preached the Kingdom of Heaven man presses into it man presses into it they came they they came for lot of things and let me tell you you see this word this word of God created everything amen if you want to get rich you can use this word to get rich praise the Lord amen you want to be a ruler you can use this word to be a ruler praise the Lord as much as a detector you this word it creates everything but you see the ultimate desire of this word is not for you to use it just for a gain that will satisfy you the ultimate desire for this word is for this word to be made flesh in us that's the ultimate desire but if you don't want that anything you want this word can give it to you anything you want the word can give it to you if that just what you want you want I just I just want I just want money I don't want to be changed praise the Lord now so we write here in uh uh uh sons of Solomon Chapter 2 as we read from verse 8 the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountain skipping upon the hill my beloved is like a road all a young half behold he stand behind our walls he Loth forth at the window showing himself through the latches amen my beloved speak and said unto me Arise My Love my fed one come away praise the Lord this sound more to me like a rapturing message it's almost like Revelation chapter 6 come up higher amen come away come up higher it's the same thing it's a rapturing cord so you you see right here in in in uh in the sons of Solomon a prophecy of the bridegroom calling the bride to come away are we together my beloved speak and said unto me Arise My Love My Fair one come away and lo the winter is passed the rain is over and gone the the flow appeared on the earth the time of the singing of the birds is come that Springtime and what spring speaks of New Life okay new life that's Resurrection that's what spring speaks of Resurrection are we together and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land the F tree P forth her grain fet the Vine with her tender grapes give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one come away as as uh as the the the the the flower is burping and and and and the Earth is is giving forth it's it's it's it's Resurrection time come away are we together oh my do thou are in the Cliff of The Rock now if you just want to take this verse 14 go over to Psalm chapter uh uh uh 27 and uh David speak of the same thing he will hide me in the Cliff of the rock that's what job said until until that you know uh your trouble is pass so you see yeah my do thou in the Cliff of the Rock in the secret place of thy stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear th voice for sweet is thy voice and thy continent is comely take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vine for our Vine have tender Graves my beloved is mine and I am his he Feth among the ladies praise the Lord amen so just like we said here before I see a prophecy of the Rapture but then what I see also so that I want to bring your mind to is uh uh uh uh things that that are happening around this time things that are happening you see it's almost like uh uh when David also uh uh uh speak that in in in in the book of Psalm and and he and and he gave us a picture of uh some of the things that will be happening you know uh uh during the time that that uh this bride is is being called away uh we know that it's a process we know that uh it's it's something that that that begins in the believer it starts a changing in a Believer just like the butterfly uh uh she goes into her and she starts to change from a caterpillar and and and one one spring morning she starts to fly away and that's how the bride will be taken away so we are in that cycle God is dealing with his people there's a change that is taking place within the bride praise the Lord one of this morning will be out of here Amen in the twinkling of an eye so but right right in this space of time we see uh uh uh you know um uh there's there there's a whole lot that is happening to the church we seen uh uh you know uh uh until now uh Christian D is is one of the biggest Market you know I mean that that it just it just looks like some kind of a man man uh in investment game amen you just uh I remember a couple of years back uh when we were trying to upgrade our our system here you know uh uh you know uh uh if if some of you know me my M my shopping spree the way I goes about shopping so I was we're looking around for equipment our our soundboard at the time blew off so I I contacted a guy and uh they have uh according to what he told me you know they were selling brand new equipment you know everything was brand new about $5,000 or so they were selling it what happened is that uh they were trying to put up a church in uh uh in in in the St Paul area so they went and took loan you know and bought all of these equipment and uh uh I mean that that's the way that people think church is you know just go and rent a place buy equipment get guys that can play music you know you just pay them they come and play it and you know and and that's that's that's the way church is it's not supposed to be that way amen from the man that is preaching the gospel to the man that is playing the drums and everybody must be converted people must be people that are that are worshiping God it's not just playing music just for the people to dance and sing and then when they have when they when you finish playing music you get at the back of the house and take out your cigarette and start smoking praise the Lord you know so I start started to talk with this guy but at the time we did not have have money for I mean what all they had to sell at the time and we we didn't even needed because uh uh uh I mean uh there were there were all these uh kind of blue and green lights and all of those thing we don't even have the space for that you know so but it it just broke my heart you know that you would go and take money from the bank you know uh uh and go and buy all of these things I mean as uh uh uh uh and and but that is that is the way that people do that's the way people think the church is why because the think is it's a money-making thing you know get the right men there to sink get the right men there to you know uh uh to pump up the people and and and you know uh uh uh uh find a way into their purse and their pocket they will pay the money in no time that debt will be paid and we can do all of that and we still leave church and go home and be sorrowful and go to our beds of Sorrow go to our lives of confusion praise the Lord the church has made a poor example very poor example I mean it used to be in an honorable think in the days of the Revival when you tell the person I'm a Christian that they takes off their heart and uh I mean they see you like a honorable person they see you like a Earnest person but it almost like all of these things has flown through the window the church is just an identity we just wear it like a batch I go to Good Shepherd I go to this place it just like a batch we don't have the life praise the Lord the church has suffered violence in the hands of Cru of men that's what Jesus was saying actually he was preaching the first seal if you actually want to look at it because you go to the seals that exactly what you will see the White Horse rather are we together you know and that's that is the reason why like I I I started saying this morning you know just for us to encourage and challenge ourself you know uh uh because I mean as as the generation goes goes on if we continue like this I mean uh uh uh I mean PE everybody would just be to thems just like the book Book of Job uh Georges I mean everyone would just hold their own religion build their own Idols in their home and stay there and worship it are we together you see that is the reason why as as as people as family that comes to this little place it is our responsibility each and every one of us to make sure that what we are doing is is according to God's sacred word if you don't think so you you have all right to ask question praise the Lord it is our responsibility to make sure that what we are doing here in this little place is according to the message of the hour because what is the benefit for you to come and sit down H the man and you really don't believe what he's saying how are you benefiting Yourself Praise the Lord then if you think that you believe the word or you believe the message you better do something about it praise the Lord you know because the society now is that we just stand back we're hoping that it don't spoil but when it spoil we know why Ito I knew it and I used to see it we just there we are hoping that nothing bad happen we are just hoping that nothing bad happen it's almost like we we have this fear we are honor this fear praise the Lord when the scripture said God has not given us the spirit of fear praise the Lord he has not given us the spirit of fear that's the reason why we need to come in the house of God with our hands up Ready To Worship the Lord ready to praise God because we know what we are doing here praise the Lord so we just stay back we observe from far I'm just watching because I know these things I've been around enough I know them praise the Lord and the moment you get yourself in that place let me tell you you get a good helper because the devil will blow your mind with every negative thing that you want you are looking for he will show it to you but one thing he will not show you is the one in your own life he will point out this one oh yeah you see that other one oh yeah this other one but he won't tell you nothing about yourself and all he want to do is just pollute your mind now you don't have confidence you can't believe anybody and you can't even believe yourself that's the most high think who got me down this road praise the Lord I thought I wanted to preach a happy message today but you see it's just it's just uh you know for us to be able to see these things so we we we we we spoke on this thing how the foxes you know spoil the vine Jesus in in John chapter 15 Jesus identifi himself as the vine amen I'm the vine and you are the branches praise the Lord now so when we start of this we we pick up that as a prophecy trying to look at it as a prophecy and uh uh so we see here that uh at the birth of Jesus there were Herod the Great like I said Herod is just a title there are many hero in the Bible when you when you when you really read Bible History you realize that it's not the same Herod that were killing the two years old it was not the same Herod that killed John the Baptist it was not the same Hera that kill James in the book of uh acts so there were there were different heror all through that time but uh it kind of forfit well here it kind of fulfi well let me let me let me bring you to another scripture to be able to create a picture here praise the Lord you love the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord amen Luke Chapter 13 Luke Chapter 13 let's go to Luke Chapter 13 praise the Lord Luke Chapter 13 are we there I'm trying to bring this thing to us this morning again just to encour encourage us and challenge us for the coming year that by God's help may the Lord help us to make this church better amen praise the Lord to make this place where we would come and experience the blessings of God the power of God a place where we can create an atmosphere where our young people can can grow in the fear of the Lord not on a kind of a legalistic you see when a child grows under a legalistic ruling or training it puts a religious spirit on them praise the Lord when they get to the age of uh uh uh accountability or or adulthood they starts to get into a conflict because what happened is that they are not born again they just had a legalistic spirit on them don't do this don't do that and then now they start to experience a conflict in them so they are askings why am I feeling all of this I thought I was baptized in Jesus name praise the Lord I told my parents are message believer why am I feeling a so they get into that place of conflict and right away now they want to discour cover thems then so now it says okay it was my parents that were telling me not to do this now I want to do my own thing praise the Lord are we together and sometimes if the grace of God don't help them they hurt themselves are we together now if you read uh uh uh Luke Chapter 13 I will not take all of your time back but listen to this now verse 31 the same day there came a certain of the Pharisees saying unto him they speaking to Jesus get thee out and depart hence for Herod will kill thee praise the Lord now these Pharisees was giving Jesus an information from the inner Court you have to know that uh the sedran council they were they were the council that was set to rule the religious people and Herod was the Govern Governor that was set to rule the people that were not religious praise the Lord when the wise man came Matthew Chapter 2 where is he born King of the Jews he went straight to Herod who did Herod call the sahed council he called the religious people so the political power and the religious power always meet to destroy the word every time the word of God will be destroyed every time the church will get on a persecution U it will take the political power and the religious power it will take those two power to put pressure on the word so now they are giving Jesus and inner information get away from here Herod is seeking to kill you why because you will realize that praise the Lord are we together amen because you will realize that when you look in the scripture uh when you look in the scripture I was just looking at this this morning uh talk about all of this and really didn't put it down but uh when you look in the scripture you will realize that when Hara heard Jesus preaching the Bible say he taught that it was John the Baptist that came from the dead praise the Lord amen so if it is John the Baptist that came from the dead then we must kill him again praise the Lord now so I'm I'm I'm trying to do all of this just to to to be able to create this picture in your mind for you to understand what I where I want to go with this thing because uh uh uh uh like I said Hera was set by the Roman uh uh uh the Roman uh government by Caesar he was set over Jerusalem to rule over the people to take care of all of their their Affairs if they have any kind of a need Hera is the one that goes to Pilot pilot was representing Rome he was the representation of Rome praise the Lord that's the reason why when when when pilate attempted to let Jesus go the the the Pharisees told him well if you do that you know you will not be a friend to Caesar because we going to tell Caesar there's a man here that is claiming to be king and you are supporting that man so he was representing Rome are we together praise the Lord Herod was the one there you know uh uh over over uh uh the governance of uh of Jerusalem just just trying to give you a picture here so we can we can uh we can all follow together praise the Lord amen love the Lord okay let's uh let's go on now like I said when you look at Herod because the the the Roman government did not know how to differentiate who is Jewish and who is not Jewish for a matter of fact it took every one of them to be the same and that is the same thing that is happening today in uh uh uh in our politics that is happening there in the Middle East praise the Lord it would just TI me into a whole lot of things but that's that's exactly what is happening because uh uh uh back the the the the Roman government wanted to to destroy the identity of Jerusalem they wanted to they wanted to just destroy the identity so after Titus the Roman general came and captured the city and they had ruled the place for the while they actually decided to change the name to Palestina that's where all this history of Palestine you know they are the one that own this place they are the one there there is no there is no tribe there is no people in that place called Palestine you see and that's the way the devil works because when he can affect your identity it create crisis for you you don't know whether you belong here you don't know whether you belong there praise the Lord you have an identity crisis and the easier way to solve your identity crisis is to join every group that comes around is to just float with people this other one come you join them the other person come you join them because just you don't know who you are are we together now so it was just something like that so if you go back to the history you will realize that Herod came out of the tribe of Edom he's an Edomite are we together and being an Edomite he's from eser he from the lineage of eser so what does this take us back to Jacob and Esau it takes us right back to Rebecca the day she was visited by the Angel and the angel told her you have two nations in your womb are we together two child born of the same father and the same mother but they are going to be in Clash for the rest of their life it's affecting us spiritually it's affecting us politically everything that is happening in the Middle East is all tied back to this are we together and what what what what is it about these two sons that were born the angel told Rebecca that the other one will sell the younger one praise the Lord now you have to remember the angel never told Isaac Isaac was the father the angel told the mother amen which of course it was completely contrary to the law because the breath R must go to the older one he has the breath right he has the blessing are we together but the Bible will tell us that Esau despise it to him it was nothing of importantance to him it was just a title he despised it praise the Lord you see and and and and that kind of attitude will put a curse on the life of this boy that his entire generation was struggle that attitude of just being careless just being negligent of your truth identity he despised the breath right the Bible says he came home and and hungry and then and and Jacob says and and here is here is the thing that that was happening here for some reason Jacob was craving the breath right the one that they now had it was craving it the one that had it never care what it meant praise the Lord amen the one that that never had it and and and today is the same there are people oh how they wish they can be able to to to to h h h h to go to a church where the Bible is preach they wish they can go to the place where the power of God can be experienced and yet people has that opportunity they don't care it does not matter to them as long as they have taken a logo I'm a message believer they don't care but there are people that will read the books of Acts and they cry when will we have this thing back in the church when will the church ever be like the boooks of Acts where people will come from their houses like ananas and sop and the Holy Ghost will pick them up the Holy Ghost will be able to tell them we don't come here for your dress called you are living a life that is contrary to the word of God and Peter said the see men that have packed your husband to the Grave they will carry you also read the book of as the Bible says men were afraid to join themselves to the church because they knew that God was down there if you are not ready don't become part of it men were afraid to join thems is that same God alive is he alive then let's have him here if that God is alive let's have him here let's bring him out of this Bible praise the Lord are we together the Bible says here Luke Chapter 13:31 the same day there came certain Pharisees saying unto him speaking to Jesus get thee out and depart hence for herrow will kill thee and he said unto them Jesus said unto them go ye tell thy Fox behold I cast out devil you have to realize what is happening here biologically John and Jesus they were cursings praise the Lord spiritually he was the messenger this was the Messiah so you can tell what the feeling you can tell where this statement is coming from go and tell thy Fox praise the Lord the Bible says when Jesus was sent to herob and and herob will ask him a question he opened not his mouth you can tell where the feeling is coming from oh Herold will kill me go tell that fox he's your king to me he's a fox you know the thing about a fox is that you cannot make a pet out of a fox it might look like a dog when it's little but you cannot make a pet out of a fox a fox is made to live in the wi it's not made to run around the house you cannot make a p out of a fox it can only be around for a while it will not take too long when it start destroying things praise the lord it's no time to to pet foxes in our life get rid of it can pretty soon it will start to destroy you you cannot make a pet out of a fox some have tried go and ask them are we together go tell thy Fox behold I cast out devil and I do kill today and tomorrow in the T day I shall be perfect I shall be be fulfilled amen I'm doing what I'm doing now because in 3 days I will be fulfilled that's what he's trying to say the word perfect nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the following now so I'm I'm I'm trying to just build that picture to just see how these two sea line that started like just two two boys two twins boys but there was an identity that God will raise up in his word to bring to our attention praise the Lord amen and you see that all through the scripture you go back to uh to to to Genesis King and Abel God who identified in those two boys the seed of the sepin and the Sea line of God praise the Lord in so much that in Genesis when the Bible we call the genealogy of Adam King will never be mentioned and John will come and tell us in tell John or second John that he's uh of that evil one are we together amen and all through the scripture all through the scripture you can watch the the the the parallel of twins Judah will have twins BMA phah and Zara praise the Lord remember the story of the twi that put his hand out they got to tie the Red Band on it to identify who is the first and there is a reason why there's a reason why and it will all come back to the reason why we must be born again praise the Lord because even in you is a twins even in you is a twins when you are born again you realize that you have your twin brother inside you amen the one that always want to pray and do right but you think this guy think he's the older brother I've been around long I know better praise the Lord this one thing is the older brother are we together that the Apostle Paul who says in his word when I want to do right even mean the desire is to do right my twin want to do right but this other guy always carry me the contrary are we together oh praise the Lord glory be to God you love the Lord Jesus called Herod the fox and then it just it just make us to pay attention to that because we started seeing how he tried to kill Jesus and for that reason he order order the two years old to be killed and he's the one that uh that uh that same Spirit came on on uh that that was that was Herod the Great that same Spirit came on Herod antias and he killed John the Baptist and that same Spirit came on on uh uh uh I think it's Herod the greata the first that came uh James in the book of Acts so we see that it's it's it's just is it's that FX Spirit that's trying to destroy the vine trying to get to the life are we together we see that all through history and then we see the same thing changing his form and it's and it's and it's becoming part of the church changing his form and becoming part of the church since the day of John the Baptist this Kingdom has suffered violence you go back look at the church right right from the the the the the common history you can have right from the book of Acts Acts chapter 4 they were captured they were weeped in public places to not speak the name of Jesus praise the Lord don't attribute that to Faith it's not talking about faith because faith is humble Faith humble itself to God's word there is no there is no amount of violence that you can apply for prayer to be answered there is no amount of violence you have to believe God's word when all these crazy things that have happened around the church people that they go and claim people car I take it by violence I mean that's what the church has been doing because they think that's what the scripture is saying they keep they keep them suffer violence when they are bringing reproach against the word of God it is the kingdom that is suffering violence it's not you going out and being violent that's not what the word of God is saying the word of God is trying to alight you that what you are identifying yourself with there are forces that is against it and when if you are in this Kingdom you going to suffer some kind of a form of violence if the devil don't afflect your mind and try to destroy your home and try to destroy your children you will you will experience some form of violence you may might get in the hands of a wrong preacher that just will just rob you of everything that you have some form of violence praise the Lord if you are not if you have not experienced one year ask yourself which side are you standing on praise the Lord if if all suffer True Blood is seed ours will not be on the flowering back of East amen other give their lives ours will not be on that's just what I want to encourage you and admonish you this morning if you if you are careless about your faith and you have not even started a walk yet because you putting yourself in more Danger it's better for you to identify which side you are on and know what you have to fight for are we together you will see that right through the church ages right through the book of Acts and the thing that the church has gone through the Ving things that have happened until Jesus told him that you will even be killed and the men that we do that we think that they are bringing righteousness to God that's what he told him are we together back there it was a glorious thing for the people they knew where they stood on the word they knew what this was all about they were ready to give their life our age has been so things have been so misrepresented misrepresented let's let's let let the people go through a little little trial then all this they start back up on God God what have I done little trial let's just go through just a little thing it's all because we have misunderstand what this kingdom is all about this is a spiritual Kingdom it's not a physical Kingdom amen it's a spiritual Kingdom that is made out of a mystical body it's a mysterious body people from different background different works of life and God bring us together with all of our baggages and mess to be able to make a glorious Church to himself it's not a trouble thing it's not a national thing no it's not a national thing praise the Lord you know I I mean sometimes it really baffled my mind you know people will ask is is is is that church a Liberian Church a Liberian Church praise the Lord is your church a Liberian church I first smile because I try to be very careful not to be ruled praise the Lord but you see what we have make it to be that's what people think it's a national thing it's not a national thing we're not pushing Liberia government or tribal think there is one thing that has Authority here is this word this word praise the Lord from the one that preaches it to the least we are all subject to this word it is the word of God that governs the church not people not men's idea are we together the kingdom suffer violence I want to leave that with you I just I want to leave that with you because I could go into a lot of things and I would get I would get I would get that emphasis from on on your mind but I want to leave that with you and and and and challenge your faith this morning as we are setting up to go into the New Year Praise the Lord to remind you that you have an adversary the devil that has swor by himself in hell that devil the Bible says he know his time is up and he's a rolling lion seeking for w to devolve he have swore to himself in hell that whatever he can do to create a Mis representation of Jesus Christ he will do it and whoever he can use he will use them he don't care about age he don't care about your education he don't care about that he have SAR to himself and hell and he always come for them young when he wanted to destroy the Hebrews in Egypt he went for them young their babies were fed to the crocodiles when he can get our Young Generation and all the little children you don't have a future you don't have a future you don't have a future that you can point to that you can be proud of that's our responsibility that is that is the challenge that is before us the church is not an association where we can join it's not an association don't don't think that you pay offering your offering is your deal if you think that stop CU you're not paying due here you are not paying due for your membership because that's what happen to people when you start to correct them by the word the thing you can say I pay my tire and my offering if that's if that's your mentality you are not paying due year it's not an association this is a body this is a body and just like you care for your physical body for it to strive and you do everything to get gems out of your body that's what you must go just like we care for our physical body I mean at your age you don't expect anybody to be taking by and bathing you praise the Lord then we get you in the hospital and get you a nurse to take care of you I mean then and then we sit around the church and sometimes you think that we must call conference if this place is home to me for Fellowship you must find your obligation how am I obligated to this place what can I do to make it better what can I do to make it better because let me say that uh it's not it's not going to be any easy for us let me tell you now people that believe in Holiness and decent dresses it justes it's not going to be any easy for us I mean all the clothes are becoming perverted that our sisters go through a whole lot to be able to find a decent dress to wear it's not going to be easy the word is they are drifting in their sense because the man and women everybody taking the same identity so even the suits you go and buy you can't tell what I mean now uh uh uh uh you know later that think that she's a man can jump inside and fit well I mean there is just no different it's not going to be easy for us in no way because this kiddom suffer violence and violence want to seize it violence want to squeeze the very life out of it either shut this doors or just make this place a formal place or we just come hang around around and and you know and and and just and just live any kind of a life you want to squeeze the very life out of it and don't think that you would be excused that's why Malachi told Esther don't think that because you are in the palace you will be excused unless you don't know who you are don't think you will be excused praise the Lord whatever the coming year is bring him I don't know what is coming but I pray for the grace to be able to face it praise the Lord come why I pray that God gave me Grace to be able to face it are we together so we have all of these foxes that are spoiling in the vine I'll bring bring more information to you bring more Coast to you as we as we go into this but I just wanted to to be able to set this uh this introduction and uh in in that way to be able to encourage you it's no time to stop praying there's no time to stop praying I mean even our little ones even our little children if you not teaching your little children to be able to have their own devotion time other than have cell phones now and maybe that's what they spending all their lives on and we think that you know we giving them the best it's not the best you're just giving them a pacifier all of these little ones they must be able to have time where they can go in I mean and and and and sometimes you see it's it's you you could make it a l you could write a calandar set it up there but if they don't see you doing it if they don't see it in your life where the child comes in the room and see Mama praying and slowly step out it never leave my eyes never leave my eyes I I wake up in the night and I want to go use the bathroom when I as soon I turn over I see my mother praying I know I don't have to go in the bathroom why because when I wake up she would say did you pray and I don't want to pray so I'll just close my eye turn myself on the other side it never leave my mind it stay hunt me until tomorrow those are things that that that capture the minds of your children they see it in you when their time of trial comes they know that Papa always always used to pray let me go and pray you can shout all about all you want to do about it you did you pray today that innocent mind is saying I didn't see you praying there no time to play Down on the word like I said we we we are so spread out around the city now people an hour away two hours away but if you can be in church if you can be in church there is no reason why you should not be in church praise the Lord there is no reason why many of us we are in church today because our parents drag us to church they created that in us if if you are not doing it for your children it goes away they don't see the importance of going nothing there to capture them until I see you Tuesday night let's fight praise the Lord amen this sentiment is trying to squeeze our our Lifeline but our life is not a natural life it's a supernatural life amen he can squeeze it out it's a supernatural life praise the Lord even if we die fighting we still live on praise the Lord

business and that one business the Bible says in the book of act they went from house to house in prayer in Breaking of bread prayer the the the the the the the the the Saints kept themselves in praying because they knew that was the greatest weapon that was placed in the hands of mortar the greatest weapon is prayer it's not argument and faces and explanation oh may God just help us Saints we all need God's help if God would just help us if he would just take us back to our knees that is the place where birth begins that is the place where we begin with God how do we lost it how do we lost it that we can go an entire day without praying without seeking the face of the Lord how did we lost it how did the church lost the name of Jesus Christ that we should settle down for Father Son and the Holy Ghost and settle down for just praying and pointing on our head our chest and our shoulder how do the church go to that place how we got to the place that we don't read our bies anymore
