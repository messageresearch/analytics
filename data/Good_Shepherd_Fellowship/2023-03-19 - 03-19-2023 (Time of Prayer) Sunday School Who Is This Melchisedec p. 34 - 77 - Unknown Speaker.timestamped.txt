[0:57] call me up brother I said I got time
[1:00] right now because I want to be straight
[1:02] and we lay aside everything else to do
[1:04] it if you come up he said brother
[1:06] Branham you teach that there is just one
[1:10] God I said yes sir
[1:12] he said well he said I believe there's
[1:15] one God but one God in three persons I
[1:19] said sir repeat that again
[1:21] he said one God and three persons
[1:25] I said where did you go to school at
[1:28] and he told me a Bible College I said I
[1:32] could believe that
[1:33] you cannot be a person without being a
[1:37] personality and if your personality you
[1:40] are a one personality to yourself
[1:43] you're a separate individual being
[1:47] and he said well the theologians can't
[1:49] even explain that I said it's by
[1:51] revelation
[1:53] and he said I can't accept Revelation I
[1:56] said then there's no way for God to ever
[1:58] get to you because it's hid from the
[2:01] eyes of wise and prudent and revealed to
[2:03] babes revealed Revelation revealed to
[2:07] babes such as will accept it and learned
[2:11] now I said there'd be no way for God to
[2:13] get to you you close yourself off from
[2:15] him the whole Bible is a revelation of
[2:18] God the whole church is built upon the
[2:21] revelation of God
[2:22] there's no other way to know God Only by
[2:24] revelation
[2:25] to whom the son will reveal him
[2:28] Revelation everything is revelation
[2:31] so to ex not to accept the Revelation
[2:34] then you're just a cold Theologian and
[2:37] there's the hope for you
[2:39] now how we find out that this person had
[2:43] no father no mother no beginning of days
[2:45] or ending of life
[2:48] it was God
[2:50] in Martin now the world the word comes
[2:54] the Greek word means change was used
[2:57] changing himself and morphed from one
[3:01] person to one person the Greek word
[3:05] there in marpa means it was taken from
[3:07] the stage act that one person is
[3:10] changing his mask
[3:13] to make him some other character like in
[3:17] in school just recently I believe um
[3:20] Rebecca just before she graduated they
[3:23] had won a Shakespeare's play
[3:26] and one young man had to change his
[3:29] clothes several times because he played
[3:32] two or three different parts but the
[3:34] same person
[3:35] he come out one time he was the villain
[3:39] and when he came out next time he was
[3:41] another character
[3:42] and now the Greek word in Martha mean
[3:45] that he changed his mask
[3:48] and that's what God did it's the same
[3:51] God all the time
[3:54] God in the form of the Father the the
[3:57] spirit the pillar of Fire
[3:59] the same God was made flesh and dwelt
[4:02] Among Us in Martha brought out so he
[4:06] could be seen and now that same God is a
[4:09] Holy Ghost
[4:11] father son holy not three Gods three
[4:14] offices three Acts
[4:17] of the one God the Bible said there is
[4:21] one God
[4:22] not three but
[4:25] that's how that they could you can't get
[4:28] this straightened out and had three gods
[4:30] you never sell a Jew that I'll tell you
[4:33] that one who knows better he knows
[4:35] there's only one god notice like the
[4:38] sculpture
[4:40] he hides but the amassed over it that's
[4:44] what God's done to this age
[4:46] it's been hid all these things has been
[4:48] hidden and supposed to be revealed in
[4:51] this age
[4:52] now the Bible says they will be revealed
[4:55] in the latter times
[4:57] it's like a sculpture keeping his his
[4:59] piece of work all covered over until the
[5:04] time it takes the mask off of it and
[5:07] there it is
[5:08] and that's what the Bible has been
[5:11] it has been a work of God that's been
[5:15] covered up
[5:16] and it's been hid since the foundation
[5:19] of the world
[5:20] and it's Sevenfold mystery and God
[5:24] promised in this day at the age of this
[5:27] lady of sea church he would take the
[5:29] mask off the whole thing and we could
[5:31] see it
[5:33] what a glorious thing
[5:36] God
[5:37] in Marvin mask in a pillar of Fire
[5:42] God in marbed in a man called Jesus
[5:48] in his church
[5:51] God above us God With Us God in us the
[5:58] condensing of God up there holy no one
[6:01] could touch him he settled up on the
[6:03] mountain and even if an animal touched
[6:05] the mountain had to die
[6:06] and then God come down and changed his
[6:09] tent and come down and live with us
[6:11] become one of us
[6:14] and we held him the Bible said first
[6:16] Timothy 3 16 without controversy great
[6:19] is the mystery of God it's for God was
[6:22] manifested in the flesh
[6:26] handled the hands
[6:28] God eat me God drink water God slept God
[6:33] cried
[6:34] he was one of us beautiful types in the
[6:37] Bible that was God
[6:40] above us God With Us now it's God in us
[6:46] the Holy Spirit not the third person the
[6:50] same person
[6:51] God came down and become flesh and died
[6:55] to death in Christ so that he could
[6:57] clean the church in order to get into it
[6:59] for Fellowship
[7:02] God loves Fellowship that's what he made
[7:04] the man at the first time far was for
[7:06] Fellowship
[7:07] God dwelt Alone
[7:09] the cherubins and notice now he made man
[7:14] and man fell so he came down and
[7:16] redeemed man because God loves to be
[7:19] worshiped the word god means object of
[7:22] worship
[7:23] and this that comes Among Us
[7:25] as a pillar of fire as something it
[7:28] changes our hearts that is the same God
[7:32] that says let there be light and there
[7:34] was light
[7:36] he's the same yesterday today and
[7:38] forever
[7:40] now in the beginning God dwelt Alone
[7:42] with his attributes as I spoke of this
[7:45] morning that's his thoughts
[7:47] there was nothing
[7:49] just God alone but he had thoughts just
[7:53] like a great architect can sit down in
[7:55] his mind and draw out what he thinks is
[7:58] he's going to to build create
[8:01] he cannot create he can take something
[8:04] that's been created and make it in a
[8:06] different form because God's the only
[8:07] way only one can create but he gets in
[8:10] his mind what he's going to do
[8:13] and that's his thoughts that's his
[8:15] desires now it's a thought
[8:18] and then he speaks it and it's a word
[8:20] then
[8:21] and uh a word is a thought when it's
[8:26] expressed it's a word a thought
[8:29] expressed is a word but it has to be a
[8:32] thought first
[8:34] so it's God's attributes then it becomes
[8:38] uh thought in a word notice
[8:43] those who have tonight
[8:47] eternal life
[8:49] was with him
[8:51] and in him and his thinking before there
[8:56] ever was an angel star cherubin or
[8:59] anything else
[9:02] that's eternal
[9:04] and if you have eternal life
[9:06] you always was
[9:10] not your being here
[9:12] but the shape and form
[9:15] that the infinite God and if he isn't
[9:19] infinite he isn't God
[9:21] God has to be infinite we're finite he's
[9:25] infinite
[9:26] and he was omnipresent omnip Mission and
[9:29] omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be
[9:32] God
[9:33] knows all things all places because of
[9:36] his omnipresent omnit Vision makes him
[9:39] omnipresent
[9:40] he is a being he's not like the wind he
[9:43] is a being he dwells in a house
[9:46] but being omnit Mission knowing all
[9:49] things makes him omnipresent
[9:51] because he knows everything is going on
[9:53] there can't be a flee bat its eyes but
[9:56] what he noted
[9:58] and he noted before there was the world
[10:00] how many times it bad its eyes and how
[10:02] much talent had in it
[10:03] before there ever was a world that is
[10:06] infinite if we can't comprehend it in
[10:09] our minds but that's God
[10:11] God infinite and remember you
[10:16] your eyes your statue whatever you was
[10:20] you were in his thinking at the
[10:23] beginning
[10:24] and the only thing that you are is
[10:27] expression word I actually thought it he
[10:30] spoke it and here you are amen
[10:33] amen if it isn't if you wasn't in his
[10:36] thinking there's no way at all for you
[10:39] ever be there
[10:42] or he is the one who gives eternal life
[10:44] do you remember how we read the
[10:46] scriptures not him that willeth or him
[10:48] that rise but God
[10:50] and that is predestination might stand
[10:53] true he could choose before any time who
[10:56] Bob's Sovereign in his choosing
[10:59] did you know that
[11:01] God's sovereign
[11:03] who was baptized or tell him a better
[11:05] way to make the world
[11:07] who would dare you tell him he's running
[11:08] his business wrong
[11:10] even the very the very word itself
[11:14] very Sovereign even the Revelation is
[11:17] sovereign he reveals to whom he will
[11:19] reveal
[11:21] the very Revelation itself is Sovereign
[11:23] God
[11:25] that's how people pounding things and
[11:27] jumping things and hidden things that
[11:29] not knowing what they're doing
[11:32] God is Sovereign in his works
[11:35] now
[11:36] we find him at the beginning is
[11:38] attribute so now you were with him there
[11:42] then is when the Book of Life comes into
[11:47] view
[11:48] now we read over here in Revelations the
[11:50] 13th chapter the eighth first
[11:53] that the Beast that comes upon the Earth
[11:55] in the United States will deceive all
[11:58] those people on the Earth
[12:01] whose names were not written in the
[12:03] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[12:06] foundation of the world
[12:08] think of it before Jesus was ever born
[12:13] 4 000 years before he came on Earth
[12:17] and several thousand years before you
[12:20] come on Earth Jesus in God's mind died
[12:24] for the sins of the world and the Book
[12:26] of Life was made and your name was put
[12:29] on that book of life
[12:32] for the foundation of the world
[12:34] that's the Bible truth
[12:36] see your knee
[12:39] was ordained of God and placed on the
[12:42] book of life before the foundation of
[12:44] the world
[12:45] you were there in his attributes you
[12:47] don't remember it no because you're just
[12:49] a part of his life you are a part of God
[12:53] when you become a son or a daughter of
[12:55] God
[12:56] just as you are a part of your Earthly
[12:58] father
[13:01] that's right
[13:04] you are the male carers the hemoglobin
[13:08] the blood
[13:09] I'm on that
[13:11] has gone in in the egg then you become a
[13:15] part of your father and your mother is a
[13:18] part of your father also
[13:20] so you're all a part of your father
[13:25] Glory that that's the denomination not
[13:28] all together amen
[13:29] [Music]
[13:31] certainly does
[13:32] God and all the only place
[13:35] notice down
[13:37] his attribute then the attribute was
[13:42] first God the thought the attribute
[13:46] itself all in one
[13:49] without being expressed then when he
[13:52] expressed secondarily he became then the
[13:55] word
[13:57] and then the word was made flesh and
[14:00] dwell Among Us
[14:02] Saint John the first chapter in the
[14:04] first verse
[14:06] notice this is in the beginning
[14:10] but before the eternal notice in the
[14:14] beginning was the word
[14:17] when the time begins it was worth
[14:20] but before it was word it was attribute
[14:23] a thought then it was stressed in the
[14:26] beginning was the expression the word
[14:28] now we're getting where Melchizedek is
[14:31] that's this mysterious person
[14:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[14:37] Word was with God and the Word was God
[14:40] Amen
[14:41] amen and then the word became flesh and
[14:44] dwelt Among Us
[14:45] hold that there now notice
[14:48] his his first being was spirit
[14:53] God Supernatural
[14:56] all right the great eternal second he
[15:01] began to form himself towards flesh in a
[15:05] theophany it's called the word
[15:08] a body
[15:11] this then is the state he was in when he
[15:15] met Abraham was called melchizede
[15:18] he was in the form of theophany
[15:22] I will get you that and prove it in a
[15:24] few minutes the Lord willing he was the
[15:26] word
[15:28] a theophany is something that you could
[15:31] not see it could be right here now yet
[15:34] you cannot see it
[15:36] it's just like well like television
[15:39] that's in another dimension television
[15:42] people are moving right through this
[15:44] room now singing
[15:46] there's colors also
[15:49] but the eye is only subject to the five
[15:52] senses your whole being is only subject
[15:54] to Five Senses rather and you are only
[15:57] subject to what the sight has been
[15:59] limited to see
[16:01] but there is another dimension that can
[16:04] be seen by a transformation
[16:08] but television now television does not
[16:13] manufacture a picture
[16:15] a television only channels that end to a
[16:19] circuit
[16:20] and then the television screen picks it
[16:23] up
[16:23] but the pictures there to begin with
[16:27] television was you when Adam was here
[16:32] television was shared when Elijah said
[16:34] on Mount Carmel
[16:36] television was here when Jesus of
[16:38] Nazareth walked the shores of Galilee
[16:40] but you're just now discovering it
[16:45] they wouldn't have believed it back
[16:46] there you'd have been crazy to have said
[16:49] something like it but now it's become a
[16:51] reality
[16:54] and so is it that Christ is here
[16:58] the angels of God are here
[17:02] and someday in the great Millennium to
[17:05] come it'll be just more real in
[17:07] television or anything else because they
[17:09] are here
[17:14] reveals himself in his great form of
[17:17] body claim as the amorphous himself into
[17:20] his servants
[17:22] and it proves himself now here he is in
[17:26] the form of spirit
[17:28] and then he comes in the form of uh in
[17:32] morphod I appeared to Abraham
[17:36] in Martha
[17:38] when Abraham was returning from the
[17:40] slaughter of the Kings here come
[17:41] Melchizedek
[17:43] talk to him
[17:45] the other day in the Tucson paper I was
[17:47] reading an article
[17:49] that where there was a a woman driving
[17:51] down the road I believe about 40 50
[17:54] miles an hour and she hit an old man
[17:56] with an Overcoat on
[17:57] she screamed and stopped her car threw
[18:00] him up in the air right out of the plain
[18:02] desert
[18:03] and she run back to find him and he
[18:05] wasn't there
[18:08] so what did she do some people behind
[18:10] her saw it happen
[18:12] saw the old man flap there in his
[18:14] Overcoat turning so they run back to
[18:16] find out they couldn't find the man
[18:18] anywhere
[18:20] they called the police force the police
[18:22] come out to examine the place there's
[18:24] nobody there
[18:25] well each one of them testified the car
[18:28] choked hit the man he went up in the air
[18:30] and everybody saw it Witnesses and two
[18:33] or three carloads of them they seen it
[18:35] happen
[18:36] come to find out five years ago there
[18:40] was an old man with an Overcoat on hit
[18:42] and killed on the same spot
[18:47] when you leave here you're not dead
[18:51] you've got to come back even if you're a
[18:53] sinner and be judged according to the
[18:55] Deeds down the body
[18:57] if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved
[18:59] we have one waiting
[19:01] in Marvin that's the word now God
[19:06] in this stage of it's the stage of his
[19:09] creation later farmed into flesh Jesus
[19:14] from what from the great beginning
[19:17] Spirit then came down to be the word
[19:20] bringing itself out the word doesn't yet
[19:23] make itself it just spoke out in Marvin
[19:26] later he becomes flesh Jesus mortal to
[19:31] taste death for all us sinners
[19:35] when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek
[19:39] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[19:44] will do in the Final End
[19:46] every son of Abraham
[19:48] every son of the faith
[19:51] will absolutely do the same thing but I
[19:54] want to watch how we have to come
[19:57] also we see him revealed here in Ruth
[20:01] and and Boaz as a Kinsmen Redeemer how
[20:04] he had to come to be flesh now we see
[20:07] the attributes sons of his spirit
[20:12] have not yet entered into the word form
[20:15] body
[20:17] but a theophany this body is subject to
[20:21] the word
[20:22] and Earnest waiting for the earnest
[20:25] change of the body now the difference
[20:29] between him and you as a son
[20:32] see he was at the beginning the word an
[20:38] inmorphed body he came in and lived in
[20:41] that in the person of Melchizedek
[20:43] then later we never heard no more
[20:46] Melchizedek because he became Jesus
[20:48] Christ
[20:50] Melchizedek was the priest
[20:52] but he became Jesus Christ now you
[20:56] bypass that because in that form he
[20:59] knowed all things
[21:01] and you have never been able to know
[21:03] that yet you come like Adam like me you
[21:06] became from the attribute to the flesh
[21:09] to be tempted
[21:11] but when this life is finished here
[21:16] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[21:20] we have one already waiting
[21:24] that's where we go that is the word then
[21:27] we can look back and see what we've done
[21:29] now we don't understand it we have never
[21:32] become the word we just become the flesh
[21:35] man
[21:36] not the word but and look clearly makes
[21:40] it clear
[21:41] you will never be the word unless you
[21:45] was the thought at the beginning that
[21:47] proves a predestination of God
[21:51] you can't be the word unless you're a
[21:53] thought he had been a thinking first but
[21:56] to see an artist and Temptation you had
[21:58] to bypass the theophany
[22:01] you had to come down here and flesh to
[22:03] be tempted by sin
[22:05] and then if you stand all the father
[22:08] hath given me will come to me
[22:12] and I'll raise him up at the last days
[22:16] see you had to be first
[22:18] and then you see he come right down the
[22:21] regular line
[22:22] from attribute to before the foundation
[22:27] World his name's put on the Lamb's Book
[22:28] of Life
[22:29] then from that he become the word it's
[22:31] theophany that could appear disappear
[22:33] and then he become flesh
[22:37] and return back again
[22:39] resurrected that same body in a
[22:41] glorified condition
[22:43] but you bypass the theophany and become
[22:47] flesh man to be tempted
[22:50] by sin and then if this Earthly
[22:54] Tabernacle is dissolved we have one
[22:56] already waiting
[22:58] we have not yet the bodies but look when
[23:01] this body receives the spirit of God The
[23:05] Immortal Life inside of it it throws
[23:08] this body
[23:09] in subjection
[23:11] to God
[23:13] Hallelujah
[23:15] he that's born of God does not commit
[23:17] sin amen cannot sin Romans 8 1. there is
[23:21] therefore now not condemnation to them
[23:24] that are in Christ Jesus they walk up
[23:27] ask the flesh from answer the spirit
[23:28] amen there you are see that throws your
[23:32] body subject
[23:34] you don't have to say oh if I could just
[23:35] quit drink to the Box just get in Christ
[23:37] it's all gone
[23:39] yeah
[23:40] see because your body is subject
[23:44] to the spirit
[23:47] it's no more subject to the things of
[23:49] the world they're dead
[23:51] they are dead their sins are buried
[23:54] and baptism
[23:56] and you are a new creation in Christ
[23:59] and your body becoming subject to the
[24:02] spirit
[24:03] try to live a right kind of life
[24:05] like you winning claiming you got Holy
[24:08] Ghost and going out of here and wearing
[24:09] shorts and things
[24:11] how could you do it how could the spirit
[24:14] of God in you ever let you do such a
[24:15] thing as that
[24:16] it just can't be sown
[24:19] certainly it can't be
[24:21] he's not a filthy Spirit he's the Holy
[24:24] Spirit
[24:24] amen and then when you become subject to
[24:27] that Spirit it throws your whole being
[24:29] subject to that spirit
[24:33] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[24:36] but this seed word may manifest or
[24:39] quickened
[24:41] Hallelujah
[24:44] and when the Bible said don't do this
[24:47] that body quickly turns to it
[24:50] no question
[24:52] and what is it it's the earnest
[24:55] of the Resurrection amen this body will
[24:59] be raised up again because it's already
[25:01] started it was once subject to sin and
[25:04] admire and crushing but now it's got the
[25:07] earnest has turned heaven
[25:10] thank you Lord now that's the earnest
[25:12] that you're going in the rapture
[25:14] it's an Earnest a sick person laying
[25:17] down
[25:18] nothing left but death that's all can
[25:21] happen I've seen a Shadows of people
[25:23] don't eat up with cancer and
[25:26] tuberculosis and see them persons a
[25:29] little while after that perfectly normal
[25:31] and strong
[25:33] if there is no Divine Healing then
[25:35] there's no Resurrection
[25:37] those Divine Healing is the earnest of
[25:39] the Resurrection
[25:42] amen you at the earnest money is don't
[25:44] you it's a down payment
[25:46] he was wounded for our transgressions
[25:48] with his stripes we're healed
[25:51] notice
[25:52] how wonderful
[25:55] we loving
[25:56] now this body is subject
[25:59] to the spirit have not yet entered into
[26:02] the word form
[26:04] but we are still in the flesh form but
[26:08] subject to the word
[26:10] Death In the Flesh will take us there
[26:14] just the same thing think of a little
[26:16] baby
[26:18] you can take a woman
[26:20] no matter how evil she is
[26:22] when she is pregnant
[26:24] and fixing to be mother watch before
[26:26] that baby's born I don't care how cruel
[26:29] a woman is she gets real kind
[26:32] there's something about our silence
[26:34] seems Godly
[26:35] to see a little mother fix and become
[26:37] Mother by the baby why is it that little
[26:41] body
[26:42] now it's not alive yet
[26:45] see the only thing it is it's just flesh
[26:48] and muscles that little jumping that's
[26:49] this muscles jerking
[26:51] but when it comes forth from the womb
[26:55] God breathes the breath of life into it
[26:59] and then he screams out
[27:02] see Justice assured as there is a
[27:06] natural body be formed
[27:09] there is a spiritual body to receive it
[27:12] as soon as it gets here
[27:15] [Music]
[27:23] oh
[27:37] [Music]
[27:47] [Laughter]
[27:47] [Music]
