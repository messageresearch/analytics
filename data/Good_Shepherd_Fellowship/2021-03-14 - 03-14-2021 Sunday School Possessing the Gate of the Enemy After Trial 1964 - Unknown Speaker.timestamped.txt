[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] if god kept his word
[0:15] with the natural scene which was isaac
[0:18] let's check some of the national seed
[0:20] that believed
[0:22] the full promise of god and had no
[0:24] question
[0:25] i remember there were tens of thousands
[0:28] times
[0:28] thousands time multiplied thousands that
[0:31] was circumcised and everything else and
[0:33] still was not abraham's seed yes
[0:37] sure that which is you outwards not you
[0:40] that which is you inward
[0:42] they many of them failed
[0:46] bitterly failed look in the wilderness
[0:50] they said we the day of the passover or
[0:53] to drinking at the fountain
[0:54] saint john 6 there's all rejoicing
[0:58] jesus said i'm that rock that was in the
[1:00] wilderness
[1:01] i'm the bread that come from god out of
[1:02] heaven if a man may they have not die
[1:05] they said our fathers eat man in the
[1:07] wilderness for 40 years
[1:09] he said and they are everyone
[1:12] dead dad take that word and run and see
[1:16] what it means
[1:17] eternally separated yet they were
[1:20] abraham's seed
[1:22] death means separation annihilation
[1:26] completely destroyed annihilation
[1:32] jesus said they were dead every one of
[1:34] them yet they were circumcised jews
[1:38] see folks just because we're in
[1:40] methodist baptist presbyterian
[1:42] god little confessions things like that
[1:43] the devil bleeds just as much as we do
[1:45] [Music]
[1:47] but you've got to be identified with it
[1:50] god's got to witness it to it by sealing
[1:53] with the holy spirit no question of the
[1:56] word
[1:57] if you say well that was for the other
[1:58] day is something wrong
[2:02] what if a man come running and you told
[2:05] him the light was shining
[2:06] and he run down to the base and said how
[2:08] just refuse it i just refused it
[2:10] there's no such a thing as life i don't
[2:12] believe it
[2:13] there'd be something wrong with that man
[2:16] he'd be mentally
[2:17] upset if he refuses this warm raise
[2:21] and his life-giving resource there's
[2:23] something wrong with him
[2:25] mentally and when a man
[2:28] sees the word of god made plain before
[2:31] him and identified
[2:32] and then shuts and pulls down his
[2:34] denominational curtains say
[2:36] something wrong with that man
[2:38] spiritually
[2:40] amen something's wrong with him
[2:46] there's something spiritually wrong you
[2:49] just
[2:50] can't receive it blind and don't know it
[2:55] going on to the judgment
[2:58] and god will be the judge notice
[3:04] they they did this and these seeds now
[3:06] that did believe it
[3:08] watch what happened let's check some of
[3:09] them now abraham see
[3:13] let's take the hebrew children
[3:17] because they stood true and wouldn't
[3:20] tolerate with image worship
[3:24] they refused to bow down to an image
[3:27] that the king of the nation had made
[3:30] it was made after a holy man too
[3:33] the image of daniel showed that the
[3:36] gentile race was brought
[3:38] in under the false side of
[3:41] worshiping an image of a holy man
[3:44] it goes out the same way when people are
[3:47] being
[3:48] forced to worship images of people
[3:53] it come in by revelation
[3:56] of daniel being able to interpret the
[3:58] word
[4:00] that was wrote on the handwriting on the
[4:01] law that's the way it come in
[4:03] and that's the way it goes out
[4:07] the same way of the image of the
[4:10] gentiles
[4:12] notice they refused to do it
[4:15] what did they do they were abraham's
[4:17] seed standing true to the word
[4:19] and they possessed the gates of the
[4:21] enemy of fire
[4:23] they did it god's word's true
[4:27] daniel tested for the worship of one
[4:30] true god he was
[4:33] tested for that and in the time of tests
[4:36] he stood the test
[4:40] what did god do i had to look like the
[4:43] chips down for him as we would say
[4:46] and they didn't know what to do that was
[4:48] going to feed him to the line
[4:50] but daniel stayed true to the test of
[4:52] there's one true god
[4:54] amen and he possessed the gate of his
[4:57] enemy
[4:58] god closed the mouth of the lion
[5:02] moses stayed true to the promised word
[5:06] before the false impersonators jaberson
[5:10] james
[5:11] in the test look god had met him a
[5:13] supernatural
[5:15] told him to go do these things show
[5:17] these signs and each side would have a
[5:18] voice
[5:20] moses went right down this is true as he
[5:21] knows he throw down the sticks and it
[5:23] turned into a serpent
[5:25] you know what happened here come the
[5:27] impersonators and done the same thing
[5:29] now moses didn't throw his answer well i
[5:31] guess it's all wrong
[5:32] he stayed there and waited on god
[5:36] he stayed true no matter how many
[5:38] impersonators there was
[5:40] he stayed true and when he stayed
[5:43] true to his commission to bring those
[5:45] people
[5:46] out of that place when the watergate got
[5:49] in his way
[5:50] god let him possess it and he opened the
[5:52] gate by the pillar of fire that was
[5:54] leading him
[5:55] and tucked the people onto the promised
[5:57] land
[5:59] joshua another great leader
[6:02] only two out of went to the promised
[6:04] land joshua and caleb
[6:07] they came to a place called kadish which
[6:09] was the center
[6:11] of the world at that time in so much
[6:13] that was a judgment seat
[6:16] and all they sent out 12 spies to look
[6:18] at the land
[6:20] and 12 of them come back 10 of them
[6:23] thought oh it's too much of a job we
[6:26] just couldn't do it
[6:27] well that people we look like
[6:28] grasshoppers for the side of them
[6:31] but what does joshua do he's still the
[6:33] people
[6:35] he said wait a minute we're more than
[6:38] able to take us
[6:40] no matter how little we are how much in
[6:42] the minority what was he doing
[6:43] he was standing true to that promise
[6:46] i'll give you this land
[6:48] but you fight every inch of it you
[6:51] believe that mother
[6:54] god's giving you your healing but your
[6:56] fire inch of it
[6:58] everywhere the soldier your feet sets
[6:59] that i give you for possession
[7:01] footprints means possession it's all
[7:04] yours every promise belongs to you but
[7:06] you'll fight every inch of the way in
[7:07] and out
[7:10] now joshua knew what god said he was the
[7:13] seed of abraham
[7:15] he said i believe that that god gave us
[7:18] the land and we were more than able to
[7:20] take it
[7:20] and because he stood the test against
[7:22] the whole
[7:24] group of israelites all the tribes and
[7:27] all the people born and cried
[7:29] joshua said keep still god made the
[7:33] promise
[7:34] no matter how big the automotive
[7:35] opposition is and what the doctor said
[7:37] god give the promise it's up to god to
[7:41] do it
[7:42] what did he do when he come down to the
[7:45] river of jordan
[7:46] he possessed the gate
[7:49] that's what he did jericho closed up
[7:52] like a
[7:53] turtle in a shell what did he do he
[7:55] possessed the gate
[7:58] even one day when his enemy was trying
[8:01] to take him
[8:02] he possessed the gate of his enemy so
[8:04] much that he commanded the sun to stand
[8:06] still
[8:07] and the sun ovady and never turn for 24
[8:12] hours god's true to his promise no
[8:15] matter what he has to do
[8:18] bankrupt the heavens before he let his
[8:19] word go defeated
[8:22] never made a promise that he can't keep
[8:25] i'm the lord heals all that is jesus
[8:28] if you lay hands on the sick they shall
[8:30] recover amen
[8:32] if thou canst believe all things are
[8:34] possible
[8:36] joshua believes it though god had to
[8:40] stop the earth
[8:42] from turning held it there but some
[8:44] other power
[8:46] his own power that the world never
[8:49] turned for 24 hours
[8:51] to joshua avenged himself upon his enemy
[8:54] he tucked the gates certainly he did
[8:58] god's ever true now i wish we had time
[9:01] to get to more heroes but
[9:02] we've got about 10 minutes now look
[9:06] all these precious heroes
[9:09] as they were great lawyers of faith they
[9:12] all
[9:13] died at the gate of death
[9:16] they all perished right at the gate of
[9:18] death
[9:20] then come on the royal seed of abraham
[9:26] they were all the natural seed from
[9:27] isaac but here come the royal seed of
[9:30] abraham
[9:31] which was christ abraham's seed of faith
[9:35] what we're supposed to be
[9:38] you see how whether we are or not
[9:42] the natural seed only was a type
[9:46] all others was born of natural birth but
[9:49] he come
[9:50] a virgin birth see that wasn't
[9:53] of the seed of abraham man a jew he come
[9:56] by the seed of faith of the promise
[10:01] and then we're supposed to be his
[10:02] children
[10:04] through this man watch what he did
[10:07] when he was on earth he
[10:10] conquered and possessed every gate the
[10:14] enemy had
[10:16] the royal sea
[10:19] he promised it by the word he conquered
[10:21] it
[10:22] he conquered the gate of sickness for us
[10:25] that's what he come to do remember sick
[10:28] people
[10:29] he conquered that gate you don't have to
[10:33] conquer it
[10:33] he conquered it
[10:37] the other man had to conquer their own
[10:39] gates
[10:41] but you don't have to conquer it's
[10:42] already conquered
[10:44] you conquered the gates of sickness and
[10:46] what did he do
[10:47] when he conquered the age of sickness
[10:50] saying
[10:51] that he would whatever you
[10:54] asked on earth and whatever you bound on
[10:56] earth he'd bind it in heaven
[10:59] give us the keys to the gate he
[11:02] conquered the gate
[11:03] of temptation by the word
[11:07] and the keys was resist the enemy and
[11:10] he'll flee from you
[11:11] he conquered it all conquered every
[11:14] sickness
[11:15] conquered death and he conquered hell
[11:19] he conquered death and hell
[11:24] he conquered what the others couldn't
[11:26] conquer because they're the natural seed
[11:30] this is the spiritual scene he conquered
[11:32] the
[11:33] gates of the grave and rose up
[11:36] on the third day for our justification
[11:40] and now we are more conquerors
[11:44] we just walk right into it as an
[11:46] inheritance
[11:48] more than conquerors now we are dealing
[11:51] with a defeated
[11:52] enemy sickness is defeated
[11:57] death is defeated hell is defeated
[12:00] everything's defeated oh
[12:03] my wish twice by science now maybe i
[12:07] feel twice as good
[12:11] we are disputing with a
[12:14] conquered enemy don't wonder if paul
[12:18] could say when he's
[12:19] building a block to chop his head off he
[12:21] said oh death where is your thing show
[12:24] me why you can make me squirmle and
[12:25] scream
[12:27] grave what is your victory and you think
[12:29] you'll mow me out there
[12:31] i'll point you to an empty world over
[12:33] there and i'm in heaven
[12:38] a defeated enemy the royal seat of
[12:41] abraham
[12:42] now the natural
[13:18] know what if paul could say when he's
[13:20] building a block to chop his head off he
[13:22] said oh
[13:22] death where is your thing show me why
[13:25] you can make me squirmle and scream
[13:28] great what is your victory and you think
[13:30] you'll mow me out there

[13:34] there and i mean heal me raise me up to
[13:36] believe things
[13:38] a defeated enemy the royal
[13:42] seat of abraham now the natural seed
[13:44] cannot point to that
[13:46] but the royal sea can conquer

[22:59] omnipresent on that mission omnipotence
[23:02] sees them they are yours father i
[23:05] present them to you now as trophies
[23:08] made this experience to them standing
[23:10] there now knowing what they have done
[23:12] knowing what this means that they stand
[23:16] to take their stand
[23:18] with the large despised few
[23:21] may they ever remain true until that day
[23:24] they stand in your presence
[23:26] then that lovely voice will say yes
[23:29] one day in baton rouge or a little place
[23:32] called denim spring
[23:34] he stood for me father now i'll stand
[23:37] for him
[23:38] for her granted lord they're yours in
[23:41] jesus name
[23:42] amen god bless you for your stand
[23:46] god ever not do this one thing for me
[23:49] fine
[23:50] if you're around where these pastors are
[23:53] see if you
[23:54] talk to them if you haven't been
[23:55] baptized yet in christian baptism do so
[23:59] get yourself amongst believers now real
[24:01] believers
[24:02] not make believers real believers
[24:05] while we're praying let's pray for these
[24:06] handkerchiefs heavenly father these
[24:08] sanctions goes out now
[24:10] or i don't know maybe some old blind
[24:13] daddy's sitting out here in a little
[24:14] swamp
[24:15] somewhere waiting for this anxious to
[24:17] come a little baby land on a hospital
[24:19] bed
[24:20] a mother standing frantically waiting
[24:22] for the return of the handkerchief
[24:25] heavenly father i pray that you'll go
[24:27] with them
[24:28] and for a token of your presence today
[24:31] and our faith in you as we preach thy
[24:33] word
[24:34] may the faith that was in abraham
[24:37] and the faith that was produced and
[24:39] given to us by jesus christ
[24:41] may go with these handkerchiefs and heal
[24:43] everyone that is laid upon
[24:45] we send them in jesus name amen
[24:52] just a moment before we call the prayer
[24:54] line
[24:58] the omnipotent mighty god
[25:02] the grave on the all-sufficient one
[25:05] please friends uh i'm going to start
[25:08] praying for the sick and i probably want
[25:10] to come down
[25:11] uh i mind i get to say nothing to you so
[25:14] maybe you may go before that time
[25:16] whatever you are if you didn't even
[25:18] stand a while ago
[25:19] and you're not sure if you're a member
[25:21] of a church that's a good thing
[25:23] but that's not good enough see the rich
[25:26] young ruler was a member of the church
[25:29] and he asked jesus what could he do to
[25:31] have eternal life
[25:32] he never accepted it he walked away what
[25:35] a foolish thing for that young man to do
[25:37] don't take his place you remember the
[25:39] last time he was identified
[25:41] a little later he prospered he got
[25:44] richer
[25:45] he got to a place to even his barns
[25:47] bursting but then we find his last
[25:49] identification in hell flames tormenting
[25:55] don't don't let that happen to you
[25:57] accept christ you young people you young
[25:59] girls
[26:00] young boys this is the turning of life
[26:02] please do that
[26:04] hear me as as your brother one who loves
[26:06] you i'm here because i love you
[26:08] i love god and i love you and i cannot
[26:11] love god if i don't love you
[26:13] i'd love a lot brother if you had a
[26:14] comment to pass pass it on my son out
[26:16] there
[26:17] or one of my children let me just i'll
[26:19] go without it
[26:20] any parent will do that so god
[26:24] these lovish people love one another you
[26:27] said what are you scolding for
[26:28] genuine love is correct if your child is
[26:32] sitting on the street you say well
[26:33] there's
[26:33] a junior he ought to do that but i don't
[26:35] want to hurt his little feelings
[26:37] you don't love me you get killed there
[26:39] if you love him you'll bring him in and
[26:41] give him a
[26:42] spanking you'll make him obey that's the
[26:45] way god does
[26:46] love is corrected that's genuine love
[26:50] when a preacher standing let you women
[26:52] bob your hair and wear paint and stuff
[26:54] don't correct it there's no genuine love
[26:56] there
[26:58] won't call out let you man marry it
[27:00] three or four times
[27:01] all these other things and get by with
[27:03] it there's no genuine love there
[27:05] let you join a church and pat you on the
[27:07] back smother you some creed
[27:09] then that's all you have to join the
[27:10] holy church there's no love there
[27:13] or either a man so totally lost himself
[27:15] he don't see
[27:17] genuine love is corrective and brings
[27:19] you back to the word of god look at
[27:21] jesus how what he said
[27:22] because he loved them so much that he
[27:25] died in their place when he's even
[27:27] calling for his blood
[27:30] now may the great holy spirit i want to
[27:33] wait to see
[27:33] i'm waiting until the anointing of the
[27:35] holy spirit gets up on me before we
[27:37] get started i've been preaching thank
[27:40] you for your cooperation
[27:42] not each one in here wherever you are
[27:44] any word of building pray just for a
[27:46] minute

[27:52] let me touch your experiment jesus said
[27:55] you know when the woman touched his
[27:56] garment

[28:01] turned around and knowed who she was and
[28:03] what she did

[28:06] high priest can be touched by the
[28:07] feeling of our infirmity
[28:11] you believe each one of you now it is
[28:13] true that the god that made this promise

[29:06] scene
