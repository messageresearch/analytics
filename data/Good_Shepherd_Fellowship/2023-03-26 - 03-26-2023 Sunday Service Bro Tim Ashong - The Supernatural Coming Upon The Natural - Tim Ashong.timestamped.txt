[55:53] I realized I was not able to go to the
[55:55] restroom
[55:57] to the bathroom to pee I said what is
[56:01] happening I was having challenges
[56:04] so well
[56:06] I trusted the Lord he took me through
[56:10] on the flight and
[56:13] they put me in the hotel and
[56:15] I was having this difficulties and I was
[56:18] praying what am I going to do
[56:21] but God is always there
[56:24] so just at that time
[56:26] he moved upon one of my nephews that was
[56:30] there
[56:30] it was in another place but it felt like
[56:33] coming to the hotel that was about 10 pm
[56:37] coming there when he came I said no I
[56:39] could not use the restroom he said what
[56:41] he said let's go to the emergency I said
[56:43] oh no he said no no you got to go here
[56:45] in America that's what we do
[56:47] so it prevent upon me and we got there
[56:50] and they have to
[56:52] wow I was so much in place I could not
[56:55] see that so they just were able to get a
[57:00] you know retain this urine that was
[57:02] written get out and they have to get it
[57:04] cut it out on me
[57:06] and I was supposed to present the
[57:08] morning and Sunday evening
[57:11] he helped me I preaching now
[57:14] every Sunday morning I pray Sunday
[57:15] evening with the same catheter of me and
[57:19] after a week I left yeah so
[57:22] they took it out and I left so I didn't
[57:24] have that any problem again until
[57:27] last May
[57:29] I think I went to Liberia in
[57:32] February I know January somewhere to
[57:34] March so I was there in about for about
[57:37] seven weeks in Liberia and then that
[57:42] I came back so I was planning on leaving
[57:44] to Sierra Leone
[57:47] but then I began to feel when I have to
[57:49] pee I feel something I said no I have to
[57:51] see the doctor the next Monday
[57:53] but as the Lord we have a Sunday night
[57:55] uh midnight I could not sleep so
[57:59] my wife has to take me let's go to see a
[58:02] doctor so I was thinking I was in pains
[58:05] man goodness
[58:07] and then they have to put the catheter
[58:09] on me
[58:10] and
[58:12] I have to wear that catheter now oh boy
[58:16] you talk about pain so you talk about
[58:18] whatever was working
[58:22] I could not sleep for about two months
[58:26] I could not sleep day or night in pains
[58:30] so our journey was
[58:33] today
[58:34] doctor because sometimes I said they
[58:36] should take off the catheter they will
[58:38] take it out and I'll still be having
[58:40] problems
[58:41] so it had been in and out in and out in
[58:44] and out
[58:45] so
[58:46] my wife began to contact the brothers
[58:48] you know this brother if he has to go to
[58:51] the U.S and
[58:52] because we have seen the doctors over
[58:54] there it's okay but I didn't even want
[58:56] to come to the U.S I said no you have to
[58:58] go so different Brothers begin to call
[59:01] him no no and then they finally better
[59:03] bury coffee the Two Brothers Coffee say
[59:05] no he said hey brother you have to come
[59:09] so finally he said look brother if you
[59:11] can walk if you can move you better get
[59:13] out before it becomes something so
[59:17] I got him that was last July yeah first
[59:21] week in July I gave to the US so so it
[59:24] had been on and on and on until
[59:29] they have to the doctor seen the doctor
[59:31] in and out but I want everyone peace
[59:34] everybody praying the different brothers
[59:35] and groups across the country different
[59:38] parts of the world that I was known they
[59:40] were all free
[59:41] so my wife has to join me coming
[59:44] October so the surgery was scheduled for
[59:47] November
[59:49] so as the Lord we have it
[59:52] major surgery
[59:54] radical whatever they call it what's the
[59:57] name of it
[1:00:00] prostatotomy all these medical attempts
[1:00:02] and names
[1:00:04] we'll go and see the doctor they will be
[1:00:06] talking about this
[1:00:08] I would just be
[1:00:10] you I don't know what he's talking about
[1:00:12] try to explain this and my wife said
[1:00:15] talk to me I'm the medical person so
[1:00:17] what thank God for her because
[1:00:20] she would we'll all be in with the in
[1:00:23] the doctor's office so after what did he
[1:00:25] say
[1:00:27] they were explained to me here because
[1:00:29] and they said they saw some cancerous in
[1:00:33] the little portion of the uh prostate
[1:00:36] and they said the prostrate has grown
[1:00:38] big too big
[1:00:40] so I could not be on my own
[1:00:43] but they did the surgery anyhow thank
[1:00:45] God for his grace and mercy and then
[1:00:48] after it has been done they did the
[1:00:51] surgery the next day I was discharged so
[1:00:54] we went too far after I have to be
[1:00:57] rushed
[1:00:59] a time to the emergency
[1:01:02] and you know I we went to the hospital
[1:01:06] that day to do what they call it the
[1:01:10] what again they call it
[1:01:12] sister gram
[1:01:16] so I guess I was on the table
[1:01:20] for the sister ground to be done they
[1:01:22] have to take some pizza to see if
[1:01:25] where they Stitch
[1:01:27] Within
[1:01:28] to see that uh
[1:01:30] it was healed so I was there on the
[1:01:33] table like this and
[1:01:35] all of a suddenly I started trembling
[1:01:38] and shaking and what happened they said
[1:01:39] what's wrong I said nothing I don't know
[1:01:41] and it was so mad that they could not do
[1:01:44] this histogram
[1:01:45] so they came out said
[1:01:48] my wife came up said no this cannot be
[1:01:51] none I didn't know what happened I only
[1:01:53] saw myself in the emergency
[1:01:57] I stayed there for six days
[1:02:02] and God was good
[1:02:06] God was so good you can't beat him
[1:02:10] you know at this time
[1:02:16] I was staying with Western with my
[1:02:19] sister and the son and they've left us
[1:02:21] to Ghana
[1:02:23] so just the two of us at home and
[1:02:26] sometimes the brothers will come in and
[1:02:27] take on us so
[1:02:30] that day we had an appointment
[1:02:32] to go and see the doctor
[1:02:34] for the systogram and God worked it out
[1:02:37] that it happened right in front of the
[1:02:39] doctors I mean
[1:02:41] if it had happened when we were there in
[1:02:43] the house it would have been very
[1:02:45] difficult because in my condition I will
[1:02:48] not even tell what to be done and he
[1:02:50] would not know what to them to do
[1:02:52] whether you have to call 911 whatever
[1:02:55] I'll call a brother and but God is
[1:02:58] always there
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:01] yeah the Lord was right there that we
[1:03:04] have to go to we went to the hospital
[1:03:06] fine there was nothing wrong with me
[1:03:08] but just as they put me on that table I
[1:03:11] begin to have some Jackson there and
[1:03:14] when they call my wife
[1:03:16] they you know put me in that emergency
[1:03:18] and then my system everything was going
[1:03:21] down shutting down
[1:03:24] and they begin to look at her she was
[1:03:26] looking at them it was shutting down
[1:03:30] but God came down again amen
[1:03:35] and they begin to pick up again
[1:03:37] so if you see me standing here
[1:03:40] is the hand of Jehovah God
[1:03:48] thank you
[1:03:51] after six days we were discharged the
[1:03:55] mess a day or two we have to be rushed
[1:03:57] back to the emergency again
[1:04:00] I was throwing out I was they just have
[1:04:03] to get me back there
[1:04:07] but again
[1:04:08] it took us through
[1:04:12] so
[1:04:13] the 9th of January
[1:04:15] the capital was taken away
[1:04:18] that is after eight months
[1:04:26] after eight months
[1:04:30] God is good
[1:04:32] [Music]
[1:04:36] after some time
[1:04:39] I realized when I sit down I cannot even
[1:04:42] get up
[1:04:44] because they did some work what did they
[1:04:47] remove there
[1:04:49] lymph nodes
[1:04:52] I I don't know about those things
[1:04:57] so maybe this morning Sunday those might
[1:04:59] be removed from some of us
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:04] so they did that and after a while
[1:05:08] not the amazing thing after all these
[1:05:10] children things and that I didn't have
[1:05:12] no problem I was walking I was managing
[1:05:14] then after this time if I lie down on
[1:05:17] the bed I could not get up
[1:05:19] see it I could not get them
[1:05:21] so what is happening
[1:05:25] if I lie down my wife has to
[1:05:28] pull me out
[1:05:30] CSF had problems having a lot of
[1:05:33] backings and challenges and things and
[1:05:36] that's it but the two of us are in the
[1:05:38] room what are we going to do
[1:05:41] if I sit down they have to get me out
[1:05:46] to clap for her

[1:22:27] as his custom was he went into the
[1:22:30] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:22:33] up for to read
[1:22:36] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:22:38] book of the prophet isaiahs
[1:22:42] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:22:46] a place where it was written yes
[1:22:50] so Jesus read books
[1:22:53] so he brought a brand read books Jesus
[1:22:55] read books
[1:22:57] always read from other people Jesus

[1:23:06] read the books here he read this man
[1:23:07] Bruce brother Branham he told us instead
[1:23:10] told us I read books
[1:23:16] said I understood by the books yeah
[1:23:19] that books
[1:23:28] not the prophets they read from one
[1:23:30] another
[1:23:33] when Jesus said my son only by breath
[1:23:35] alone but Moses has already said it
[1:23:38] was decided
[1:23:41] where Jesus was here he said you have
[1:23:45] had a vote
[1:23:46] it is written like this but I say to you
[1:23:51] so he read he knew and he added to what
[1:23:55] has not been done
[1:23:57] the prophet came in he read Luther
[1:24:00] Wesley different things but then he came
[1:24:03] to gather the Loose Ends
[1:24:06] what they left behind he gathered it
[1:24:10] to give it to the bride
[1:24:12] and he said when the mystery has been
[1:24:15] done the work has been done the worst is
[1:24:17] done then God came back to reveal it yes
[1:24:20] to show us what has been what was and
[1:24:24] what to be
[1:24:28] praise the name of the Lord
[1:24:30] talking to somebody yesterday or day
[1:24:32] before and we're talking about oh they

[1:24:57] fees that Moses give to you

[1:25:09] if Moses glorify himself and God took
[1:25:12] him away okay glorify himself and God
[1:25:15] took him away it has nothing to what he

[1:26:05] all my prayer
[1:26:06] that's the request I give also to you
[1:26:10] that what you hear on the test

[1:26:16] and he glorified Jesus Christ
[1:26:19] and he preach on Holiness and he's talk
[1:26:23] about the preeminence of Christ that
[1:26:26] Christ is everything
[1:26:28] not the second person not the third

[1:31:00] [Music]
[1:31:01] through a prophet
[1:31:03] God used that Voice Jesus Christ again
[1:31:07] in his servant
[1:31:09] what are you talking about you all this
[1:31:12] this happened just like that
[1:31:14] just like coincidence
[1:31:16] it was planned by Jehovah God
[1:31:20] so we have not believed cannily devised
[1:31:24] Fables
[1:31:28] are we together
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:31] oh man may God help us my prayer
[1:31:37] this things
[1:31:39] God help me to live by it
[1:31:41] let this thing be made flesh in me
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:47] let this word be made flesh he made the
[1:31:50] review word
[1:31:53] to line up with this word
[1:31:57] what are they talking about
[1:32:01] and your mind is moving like this and
[1:32:03] that
[1:32:05] no double-minded person can have
[1:32:08] anything from God
[1:32:11] you must be convinced
[1:32:13] you must be concerned yeah
[1:32:18] because these things are the true say of
[1:32:21] almighty God
[1:32:23] that's happening for happiness sake what
[1:32:26] are you talking about
[1:32:28] are you crazy
[1:32:30] brother said do you think God will give
[1:32:33] me the ministry he has given me if
[1:32:36] indicate it all over the world and leave
[1:32:38] me in error he says certainly not I know
[1:32:41] where I am standing
[1:32:44] if you don't understand anything
[1:32:47] that doesn't make it wrong
[1:32:50] remember you don't understand it so if
[1:32:53] you don't understand the limit please
[1:32:54] God help me
[1:32:57] amen yes
[1:32:59] don't try to put your interpretation to
[1:33:01] it
[1:33:08] I believe that day when Jesus read that
[1:33:11] scripture he said every eye was set and
[1:33:13] we said this is the discreeter everybody
[1:33:15] was looking and what is he talking about
[1:33:17] is he is he meaning that this thing is
[1:33:19] concerning yes it was concerning he knew
[1:33:23] the scripture that concerns his ministry
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:29] God help us
[1:33:30] are we together
[1:33:32] what I want to speak on little is uh the
[1:33:35] Supernatural coming upon the natural
[1:33:40] praise the Lord
[1:33:42] I want you to know
[1:33:44] to know that God said before Miracles
[1:33:47] can be done the supernatural must come
[1:33:49] upon
[1:33:52] we are flesh and blood
[1:33:55] there is nothing good in US
[1:33:57] but remember we have been brought here
[1:34:00] for a purpose
[1:34:02] and before you can save that purpose the
[1:34:05] supernatural has to come down Glory
[1:34:10] and nothing must come down
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:14] must anoint you
[1:34:16] to fulfill the purpose for which you are
[1:34:19] brought here
[1:34:21] that is why the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:24] Ghost is a mass yes
[1:34:26] because even
[1:34:27] the disciples don't go out and preach
[1:34:29] don't do anything wait for the promise
[1:34:31] of the father
[1:34:35] praise the Lord
[1:34:37] what
[1:34:40] because you need that anointing
[1:34:43] Jesus started this ministry with the
[1:34:46] anointing
[1:34:47] I saw the Spirit descending upon him
[1:34:50] like the form of a dove
[1:34:52] so Jesus of Nazareth the Bible said was
[1:34:55] anointed
[1:34:57] and he went out doing good
[1:35:01] the anointed that came upon him was for
[1:35:04] a purpose
[1:35:06] to do the will of the father to set the
[1:35:11] purpose of the father for you to set the
[1:35:14] purpose of the father you must get the
[1:35:16] same anointing
[1:35:22] it's not your size it's not my side it
[1:35:26] is God has to anoint us
[1:35:28] young women if we are going to do it we
[1:35:31] must get that anointing
[1:35:35] sisters we must get that anointing
[1:35:39] the power of the highest
[1:35:42] the supernatural must come upon the
[1:35:44] natural
[1:35:46] the Bible tells us like in the days of
[1:35:49] old
[1:35:50] before Christ came in they had a pool of
[1:35:53] bethesia
[1:35:55] and the Bible tells us in John chapter 5
[1:35:59] thousands of people hundreds of whatever
[1:36:02] might be gathe
[1:36:06] he said because at the certain time or
[1:36:09] certain period And in the acceptance
[1:36:11] season and Angels steps into the water
[1:36:15] still the water moves the water
[1:36:17] and whatsoever will get there first
[1:36:20] we get healed drop into the water jump
[1:36:22] in is healed
[1:36:24] and according to history
[1:36:26] people fight over there of course if I
[1:36:29] was there I would fight yes because you
[1:36:32] want your healing and there were
[1:36:34] hundreds or what thousands over there
[1:36:37] and
[1:36:39] everybody was just looking
[1:36:41] and the Supernatural is that the water
[1:36:43] is from one way but when the engine
[1:36:46] moving it goes that way
[1:36:49] so the everybody oh man you might be
[1:36:52] going this way but when that anointing
[1:36:54] comes it diverse go this way
[1:36:57] the supernatural
[1:37:00] because it is ordinary the water is just
[1:37:03] flow like this but the power of God that
[1:37:05] comes down takes it over why is back
[1:37:10] it is the current take this everything
[1:37:13] he moves upon it and stop it and go this
[1:37:15] way
[1:37:16] and whatever condition you are in
[1:37:18] whatever situation you are in whatever
[1:37:21] state you're going let the power of the
[1:37:23] highest come down and change your course
[1:37:28] to the right direction to the way God
[1:37:30] wants you to go not where you want to go
[1:37:33] not how you want to live know what you
[1:37:35] want to do but the power of the highest
[1:37:38] we come down upon us and turn our cross
[1:37:41] thank you Lord
[1:37:43] praise the Lord Hallelujah
[1:37:46] praise the Lord
[1:37:48] are we together
[1:37:49] are we following that
[1:37:51] the supernatural
[1:37:54] comes upon the Water the natural also
[1:37:57] unto the angel steps in instead of water
[1:38:00] it Remains the Same it's just water
[1:38:03] you're jumping nothing happens
[1:38:07] you're getting nothing but when that
[1:38:10] angel moves in when the supernatural
[1:38:13] comes down
[1:38:14] turn it this way
[1:38:16] and then whoever gets in WoW
[1:38:21] can you imagine what was happening over
[1:38:22] there
[1:38:24] fighting
[1:38:28] because hey
[1:38:30] we are all sick when we are all if you
[1:38:32] are there you are circums everybody
[1:38:35] you think about yourself
[1:38:37] before you can think about somebody else
[1:38:40] as we are sitting we are both
[1:38:42] tell the bee will be out
[1:38:46] before I say
[1:38:51] I'm telling you nobody will come from
[1:38:52] the back say are coming to fix my wife
[1:38:55] first no
[1:38:59] body will be struggling
[1:39:01] because you don't know what they say you

[1:39:05] everybody scattered you come up before
[1:39:07] you say hey I left my wife
[1:39:09] mothers will leave their children
[1:39:12] oh my God
[1:39:16] so that was struggling over there
[1:39:20] for physical healing
[1:39:24] the prophet of God said if there is a
[1:39:26] drug
[1:39:28] that if you take that drug
[1:39:31] you will live 100 years straight
[1:39:33] or whatever years will be he said you
