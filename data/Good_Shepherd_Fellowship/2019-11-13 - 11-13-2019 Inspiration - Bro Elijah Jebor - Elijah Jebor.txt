wasn't washed onto the real Bible look at the scriptures in the book of Matthew 2:16 amen Matthew to the sixteenth Martita 16 verse 13 nah I really would have God Matthew 16 verse 13 when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked a disciple saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man a.m. and he said some say that thou art John the Baptist some said Elias some say ordered an order Jeremiah or one of the prophets in some of them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said unto Him thou are the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed a - Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood I know Rafi Eitan reveal it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and asuna dear thou art Peter and upon this rock I will be my church and a gate

spiritual for any one of us and instead those who are sick inflated I go can just toss them that go can be a desire and we can see God moving in armies amen and we tango for your prayers also and we give God the glory now our church project we are and moving on an other end hallelujah and I'll go expand the way quickly in Liberia hallelujah and we think of each degrees amen and I just read the Word of God in the book of Matthew chapter 16 and illusion and then Scriptures the Bible when Jesus came is it onto the course of video Philip paths and Syria fell apart now Jesus he no ox it's a separate question and he came and saying who do men see the son of man aim now when Jesus was asked the question was very easy because you see that when Jesus acts in the question what do arrest of men Who am I and the dessert was been answered the question it was so easy to say whatever Jesus and it's very easy to test me yy-yeah about Jesus you know so they some say also but just say you're welcome hallelujah I welcome you to America because the America before you do it he hallelujah so we just think also and when Jesus asking the question J Mahajan and some was saying what oh you are German or some say you're Elijah some say you are yeah one of the Prophet and already know get that V what I be hearing what people sing about Jesus but you see but Jesus it was so easy for delegate testimony what it being hearing but Jesus bring it to their own self and say about who do you see aim it means that I had be a personal revelation so he said why would you say I aim what is your V where is your third wish of mine to watch me yeah I've been working with all the years he welcomed in the other months or the years Yago Jesus and what do you think about Jesus and Jesus Ito of day he had talked of them he gained a power milligram preach the gospel when Jesus asked me a question about who do you see and the Bible said already one speechless no cookie no to talk or do they were goofy they get test them love him when Jesus asked me a question but who do you say I am they were all speechless now could he talk they were all stuck in a shell no cooking in an answer but a Bible said another inspiration when Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and where Jesus said he said bless it and now it means that before you can catch the inks in Revelation or we can be inspired the rock and who Jesus is it's a blessing if you're not blessed to see it you can never see it hallelujah if I said blessed are down it means that change is out it's an intellect grace of God it's a blessing of God for you to open your eyes to see who Jesus is so if God I bless you can never see it and illusion is why he said blessed are some by Jonah and now take note that Israel or ask the question every believer do you think of this message what this message means to you and what is a message to you hearing the message negotiate a profit Oh Muraki 14-7 but what I took this message means to you because this message is Jesus Christ in the food as I come down to us is the opening of the world I lose in a barber because a new book but what is this message meant to you are you coming because you are being a witness terminable this message or are you coming because yet up as I appreciate ever this message about Jesus but what actually I meant to you as an individual hallelujah and you might come to our place or else you owner be for in your crowd you never come to church but what our today's message meant to you as an individual hallelujah because we techno church every word jesus said who do sir aim and salvation it's the best I promise from a disease it's an individual face it's the worst of any source much but I think so salvation is not based upon what someone as think but what you think of him and divine healing isn't based upon what a criticize Oh what HS is the van hearing it bears upon your person fit in the inspire world hallelujah it bears upon your Panther faith in the inspire world how you are inspired to believe it that will bring the result it is an inspiration by the world and I take note the Bible said all scriptures right all Scripture is given by inspiration and Alou you our scriptures is him an inspiration and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness now the Bible said holy men will move but it's true of going to inspire and I wrote this scripture the root the Bible is a fool a guess apart many years apart they will move on an inspiration when I write in the Bible but a Barbuda is localisation in the world because were inspired and we'll move on and 19 to write the Bible hallelujah and just a note when I wrote another inspiration is what it further said if everybody the proposal what a song and for you to catch that song you have to be in a spirit of that composer before you get get the inspiration of the song if you don't get in a spirit of a composer you'll miss the pool and not that not that bad was that our scriptures is humor in special so this Bible is already inspired it inspired before the finish of the world the Bible is God's Word is gone into the form it sort of inspired so it means that to tell you that church the only way you can catch the revelation of the inspired Word God how to inspire you hallelujah and for God to inspire you is a blessing hallelujah it's a blessing for God to inspire you to see the inspire word so a church because Christ is the word they inspire so they will Grammy more inspiration or have been inspired but their problem is us their prevention me that were the problem so it's like that inspiration to drop on your heart to offer your eyes of understanding before you can see they inspire a word Oh s you and I come to church began the Munsey the word hallelujah it wouldn't be a guesswork then the Apostles say some said I Elijah some say Jeremiah some say I want the Prophet but who do you see so it was a guesswork but who do you say I so it took a personal revelation it took an inspiration to open your eyes to see the world and illusion or else you wanna fall in the crowd you would have been your top upon where I am at the time what do I mean to you and we realize that reading a Bible you do not read it like you would like a newspaper because the Bible is a wisdom of the Holy Spirit and it's heading many things the eyes of the wise and the prudent and revealed - babe it's sort of lame hallelujah so it's our scriptures is given inspiration hallelujah for reproof for correction for doctrine for instruction in righteousness hallelujah and techno church because the word is inspired if the word inspire you so much and you're inspired by the word because techno judge before you can be inspired there'll be a scene in Europe and techno that word jesus said thou a pit it means you are a pre-business seat of God down a pit even amid pre-tests mercy Eddie can never see it in that dollar Peter blessed are Thou are Peter and upon this rock I pour the inspire of elation is an Alabama Church and techno church and they be inspired so much by the word it take the Holy Ghost and then flesh and blood I'd never feel it to you but my father it means that church I take a fresh revelation of the Holy Ghost so can extract the seed that is ain't dog mad so putting a seed and to open your eyes to see the word hallelujah if the Holy Ghost don't inspire heart quicken I see you're gonna be based upon reasoning upon intellectual a pronoun reporting of this message what is your personal experience what is the message to you there are entire being a message in the years what it because they AB disciples walk with Christ for years between asking the question who do you say so no matter how many years you work with this message no matter how many years you stay in the church it means nothing no matter how long when I give you an office or a dick with a pretty anyone no matter how long he be in hallelujah Amy is what do you see who I am to you Alleluia and Jesus as enough it's question so if you stay get down every snake I question Mac the place is an auto ask God to open your eyes if you say get that in your heart of this message because they're having many doubts there are many questions some say Elijah some say your Jeremiah some say I want the Prophet but who do you see a and take the church and sometimes there's caused a price to see it the same jesus is it go with a price so so Jesus is a good price because if you begin to testify a base name then change them problem start and they'll go their prize to sing it out and sometimes it causes separation hoops sometimes it causes separation in churches sometimes it causes separation in all walks of life sometimes if you husband and wife you know what church because salvation is individual effects because you can be inspired to see it but I want to see it and get inspired as a wife you are seeing in your heart Bobby see it that is why you don't fall some of those see the word I think the horror goes if you catch that revelation they don't force me away you don't force your husband it's a personal experience the Holy Ghost akashi about a if he dies spiritual and your blood worth taking your fault hallelujah we touch them in love maybe for today will be ugly it's an inspiration it's a revelation to see it and you can see it opposite don't see it it's not it's a fight hallelujah but because other inspiration upon you their personal name within you are crazy the other thing you are mad no we can do now understand you because the something is moving in your heart it's an energy it's a power now move in her the believers hallelujah and techno church it says and sometimes it costs a price to see it it costs a price to really see it and double-deck note is a lot of it although you have not a mistakes but there's one time he will really inspire any student said thou the Christ the Son of the Living God brother what a statement hallelujah he said blessed are Salman bhai Jonah flesh and blood no man teach you this I meant into the church nobody bring it to this message no Gabriel to the world jesus said no man come on to my Center for I draw him no one can accept and unless God pull you in hallelujah oh yes sir it took the whole ago so bring you in that is my church no matter how much the preacher preaches the preacher don't almost a hug or convert the heart and a preacher preach the word on the inspiration then there horner gonna stick that word and struck the heart because I wasn't that would've got a shepherd and put your soul and descended thought the intent of the heart breaking everything to conflict the life why Chad because it's a seed and if I was a blessed ah let me go see this word it's a blessing because there's many out there I cannot see it many out there cannot understand it and I cannot see it but you you are wondering why they cannot see it and they will go predestination thou the Christ say bless a doubt but your bless you are blessed to rock on us women you are blessed to see it you have blessed for the Easter know struck your heart blessed Oh church what a blessing now we are in this world the house of people is that was a blessing to see who Christ is because it's not meant for everybody that's I don't foresee for somebody an illusion if they go and they put the time hallelujah now take note there you are inspiration he said what I will build my church and the gates of Hell cannot reveal that there you are inspiration in spider revelation oh ha he was to inspire steady from the Messiah is he down at the Christ and he said what is it a bone inspiration you see upon the inspiration of the Lord Jesus Christ through his word I will build my church hallelujah it's an opponent inspiration of Jesus Christ through his word I will build my church and the gates of hell what is key and I gave the revelation Oh for you come tall and they is it and it means that they get of helping to fight against it if you know your life and you are come in many forms so not in the marriages to make you disbelieve the word you are pregnant what this will help your home buddy he's not taking please he is frightened to say we see believe go and go and go give me his word what this is not working for in your home what this is not working went in your life the gate of hell is a distant relation to make you dance believe the word watching hallelujah because you're a Christian when you prima get result God use things to Bill Kristol characters in brought trials your life so the gate of hell is against you hallelujah it's an octagonal I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it in that that shows that gift of hell will be against it but they know Church again never is a promise because you're inspired because something happy within your heart so they get of her being against our inspiration against the revelation of your life it's a constant battle then if you don't catch a revelation everything be the pastor of a drink complan who began confirmed by their body family but he is fighting against a personal life hallelujah he won he reflecting you to make you lose confidence in the world but he said they were not a promise because of the inspiration because of the inspired revelation he is fighting to destroy testimony so make it discourage in the world but a Bible get a promise it can never they will never prevail they were many firmly discouraged even in situation American edition but he can never prevail hallelujah and I thought our consolation that is a revelation now I'm not on a situation now much the condition he can never overcome because I've been there more than a conquerer Louie oh yes sir amen he said nothing mattered he said that shoes God said he is worse now when the enemy comes in it can be like a floor anything off Locker they cannot destroy everything what celebrity and we're coming at the floor is it a spirit of dog well stunts oh yes sir but this remaining like a floor that's sickness it's a nice situation it's not depression but make it discourage in this life so you can play players on you you check yourself you think that is not true frustrated sad techno church say when an enemy come in the key floor he said I will raise a standard against it he said God will do it when all the gets of vomit is pressed against that little church where the church the chassis and Kawa is that when all that get of hell is pressing against than in the church it will never prevail because she is pressing I inspire revelation right I made that the word so about Jesus or synthetic sighs you know sure in the world and it take the Holy Ghost to strut their heart to cook it for you to identify the world but that not also church there's many first inspiration out there there may be false inspiration because every inspiration should come back the world hallelujah now I say the importance of Revelation by the spirit today true believer can never be over emphasized in that revelation means to you that perhaps you realize I am NOT talking about this book of Revelation I'm talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church and they then do you remember Marty sixteen if we are back to the scriptures the third hour of Jesus or think to all the importance of revolution to the church inspiration to strut your heart and they say for flesh and blood how do you fit it to you but no intellect remind no reason waiting the Holy Ghost to open your eyes hallelujah and now techno church where you see and that is world the Bible is our ultimate no matter God said let every man word be la and mommy is I believe that the Bible is God ultimate no matter what anybody else say it is the ultimate that Bible is not a book of system no it is a cool of Morris the Bible is not a book of system there are so many sister and so forth but a Bible is not a book or system no a book of history or together Neera it is a book of the logic but a Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's all learn to read that hallelujah it is a revelation be my dad even in chapter 1 verse 1 is it a revelation of Jesus Christ to the church would it judge the bra amen so it's been a good ethics you know a book of history of theology but it is a revelation of Jesus Christ god I'm sorry Jordan from the word to flesh and now take note when a man is inspired and go inspire you and go pull you out and a man is inspired and he read the Aspire word then that total gather bring result it does not matter how well you studied the word it will never do you any good until you're inspired not magic every day instead every description also done we are education would not do anything to you or let's go inspiring to see so if God inspire you and you read that is by a word into the tech note where both is spirit can forget I said you see miracle to complete you see we shot in the church that dance or the preacher is inspired and you can prayer up and you come to touch inspire and inspire one booth pop improve miracles in the church and a part of the entire church a series shot in the church become prettier inspire go moving to miss the believers but if they're probably us how do we come to church do come expecting through come on Marty go yet from the power of God's Word because come I want to check when go other who rob show the world but we'll come to the house of God is a revival against my church and if inspire was coming for a big revival in your life it take other trash amen but it is it how come to church church hallelujah so when it means inspired and he read an inspired word and it took inspiration come together it if result no matter how well you study the world till it will never do any good till you inspire yourself it take your inspiration with the word that already inspired what we need to be as an inspiration over us God sweep it down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power his love himself and mmm inspire us in my quit in the world of going to a heart in my brain that would have dog by the hood and spirit by inspiration that you see miracle taking place and things happening that is why we saw God represent himself as the makers bred on another dog he had no God and the meatiest and him on earth as a lamb because I think both nature to blame and that is my church to bring me shock hallelujah so I think you that don't inspire you and they inspire work come together the result we got a to nature ship bling hallelujah you're naturally convicted for the things of this world to the nature of the Holy Ghost wanted to come together every we saw if your nature convicted today nature of the hooligans when they to come together every result it bring the Word Alive America can say every chapter every fresh is mine hallelujah oh yes sir then you don't read it the hop or read the Bible you read it with the eyes of God then you not a death it's my move you don't gather the Messiah teased by the word hallelujah a man oh yes server now one turn was on the Bible there was Elijah Elijah Elijah knew that God was taking away a new the God had a son replacing so goggle taking away and he went for and there was Elijah proud see but there's a seat I was lying in a Shabbat so we sort of a light or passing back he took his motto and that's not Elijah what happened if clicking that see Elijah Lou because Elijah the spirit of moving to Elisha and Elijah big a predestined that see Jenna be quickly Alleluia and we saw in a month autosh him and put in that seat you saw that Elijah run to Elijah and say can you beat me to get kiss my mother for a good bath began you recognize him Anna Massey s moderate burns anymore he were permitted to wear kiss of money for Cuba but we saw in a New Testament it wasn't permitted today they'll bury the dead amen and I'll take note because enlarge was so much inspired no one tell enlarge what I do in like the Mogul thing I said okay you my party if you go this way if you do these things you do this no no no no no that is inspirational upon him drop him hallelujah I don't do Church of God inspire you no one tell you what to do he was so much inspired what Elijah did he went and take the oxen he's with new pieces he took the instrument he burned everything and he thought that that that that the tattoos he burned and make as sacrifice in the words that he said it was a son that he has is so out for everything to be a prophet he said he wearing to make every sacrifice to show he will do anything for the cost of the work Honolulu in sir what and lesson we could get tonight now every man every woman that cometh to Christ put his hand upon the play and start so even their back is not what to the plow so there there is a reason we have such a time we have four day is because they're too much have we conviction they're too much eat the electro conviction it's what you get any problem to this halfway conviction but we're gonna go don't make and have where Kristen door don't make and have a conviction yourself Commission's of halfway because go make a complete Kristen and Polly preacher and that delivers but you can make us a halfway but then you'd be neither work it's an inspiration so revelation hallelujah instead as a reason they're too many it electric conviction too much half we're convention many people today in church to monitor in church hallelujah today they're in charge Smyrna in judge whether inspiration let's move with it they've got it they get many intellectual mind really so today in church they like a switch on the wall into the switch you put a switch it on hallelujah amen voluntary church if you're so much inspired that is well if somebody brings you in hallelujah somebody else will pull out oh yeah well someone influenced you is to add somebody asking if that's a problem no conviction oh yes sir assumed a value into it when movement so I have more money to buy so that is why it's no reason it's not intellectual it's a revelation a my BSC - haha and a bit something happy to you there is you know what that's tempting that would happen church that get of hell techno Church here's know how many years you be in this message we are here active lately the terms yeah many times be 15 years a because in matter oh yeah sure happy a revelation you don't you stand it or else you're a stimulus think you see it on the foundational rock a man oh yes sir Church so you take note - well we see it's under each electron man it's probably sinning by watching my cast that reasoning cast an imagination it's not reason is the fit and fit is a revelation faith is a longer vision and faith is the master of every circumstances so if you know you're a steady be not get excuses in your life already know that there are problem you give me excuses that life there are full of excuses it's no water because of Jesus Christ yes not excuses in your life I didn't get excuses when are you okay excuse me you clean decree that journey we are wrapping border on do not open important bread no it's a rock gospel hallelujah now what Jesus blessed enough in church you can be coming but you haven't seen yet I would imagine Oh a Britta's message Oh Aprilia tapes and listen it doesn't matter nothing it was not struck you Elmen oh yeah Ragosa is something her to go splat your heart it had conflicted extract that see he said it do not be open you be the church then will you come to China beautiful not be static cut your hands you sing a love song let's start a church also go to the same it again see in it they struck me see him what he's trying to say in me struggling sir Emmet put on fire hallelujah you know the church me it's a student nation of Revelation those show where Peter the Apostles when Jesus left the see if I was in his stocking some new upper room too afraid they hid himself but a bow was said but one demure Pentecost when the power of the holy God come down with a rushing mighty wind and it struck the heart well I see it wasn't what I bring a brush to Malaysia revelation and was like a movie there was the ashamed of the gospel Jesus Christ but they were also a shame of the gospel how many of us could be inspired I don't want topside to Testament for this message how do us and I will never get down to I believe she I don't know had your feet I don't be so much to be hurt and you are heading Jesus and go ahead you along

expectation this weekend and believe there we will be blessed amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise to Allah all praise and glory belongs to the king amen the inspiration of the Almighty Allah who said in the book of Job he gives wisdom and that word inspiration actually means the breath of God if you are inspired it means that God had breathed upon you and you have become a living soul we know there are a lot of life support system in the world the world has created his own life support some people have gone to clubs and ambass and drinking to get life support but it takes the breath of God and let you and myself here tonight sitting under the inspired Word of God praise the Lord Amen praise the Lord hallelujah you know God as Ezekiel can these bones live again Ezekiel say Lord you know okay I will show you how the bones can live it's by the word prophesied breathe upon it every time we sit under the preaching of God's Word you are under the breath of God and not to respond back to God's Word with a life of repentance or a life that is watered of the gospel it's a testimony that you are there every time you sit under the Word of God that's the breath of God God is breathing upon you to give you life to give you strength to give you wisdom to give you guidance that's what Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from God's mouth that's what man Libra because that's the breath of God that's the inspiration of the Almighty praise the Lord now lochia brother Elijah said something and you are reading there from where Branham the difference between Peter inspiration and Peter mistake praise the Lord just just think about it he was the one that said thou I cried son of the Living God and then when it came to to the total to the apalis Hall before the crucification he was denying the Lord Jesus but he had that inspiration within him and sometimes that is the thing that keeps us in our weaknesses in our failure the breath of God the inspiration that Jesus is the Christ that he is the Living God it's more powerful and that's what the church is built upon you see that's the reason why the church is a mystical body the church is not the amount of people the church is the breath of God in the mists of the people that's the church the gifts of Hell can never prevail against their the gifts of Hell can scattered thousands of people all of these mega churches when their money is gone the church is gone because the money is the lifeline but the Church of the Living God the lifeline is the Word of God you love the Lord tonight
