[17:10] [Music]
[17:14] It was um May 21st.
[17:17] left my family, I went to work
[17:21] and
[17:23] I work with um Coca-Cola in Egan
[17:27] and the unit where I work at
[17:30] basically at night I'm alone
[17:34] and I'm I work with the shipping and
[17:36] receiving area and it's kind of far away
[17:39] from the other areas where you have the
[17:41] production and the receiving area.
[17:46] Now this night my wife and I spoke. We
[17:48] always communicate at night you know and
[17:53] after a while I after sitting down you
[17:55] know you want to stretch yourself and
[17:58] get the the body blood moving in your
[18:01] body at least to stretch. And while I
[18:04] was doing that stretch I decided to do a
[18:06] sit up since I just passed out.
[18:10] I just passed out.
[18:13] The grace of God woke me up. Amen. The
[18:17] grace of God woke me up because nobody
[18:20] was there.
[18:22] When I woke up, I look at myself.
[18:26] I said, "Wow, I just died. What
[18:30] happened?" And my heart start pounding
[18:33] heavily.
[18:35] So I went I sat on the chair. I starting
[18:40] my mouth. Saliva start coming out. So I
[18:43] called 911.
[18:45] So the lady asked me, "What's your
[18:46] emergency?" I said, "Oh, I can't
[18:48] breathe." Well, he said, "Okay, just
[18:50] stay with me. Stay with me." So within
[18:53] that course, I decided again to at least
[18:54] I try to I just decided to be strong. I
[18:59] said, "No, nothing will happen." So I
[19:01] woke up and decided to use the restroom.
[19:03] I got in the restroom again. I passed
[19:05] out there again.
[19:07] I woke up again.
[19:10] My goodness, this God is great. Amen.
[19:13] The God is great. Don't don't don't play
[19:16] church as pas one normally say. Let's
[19:20] serve God in truth and in spirit. Amen.
[19:24] I woke up again. I went and sat down
[19:27] within that cause the emergency people
[19:29] arrive and I called the supervisor from
[19:31] the other unit. They came
[19:33] and they asked me what happened and I
[19:35] explained and you know I start feeling
[19:36] my heart still.
[19:38] So they decided to go to get me on the
[19:42] stretcher. I said, you know, I I'll get
[19:43] on the stretcher. I still try to deny
[19:46] that. I mean, nothing happened. So I I
[19:49] lied on the stretcher and they put me in
[19:51] a van in the ambulance and they start
[19:53] doing the I mean open the IV lines and
[19:56] everything and asked me all the
[19:57] question. So I was taken to United
[20:00] Hospital down in St. Paul. And within
[20:02] that cause my wife called.
[20:05] So she asked what happened. I said, "Oh,
[20:07] no. It's not anything." She thought I
[20:09] was actually maybe in the office
[20:11] listening to something while people were
[20:13] talking around. I said, "I'm fine.
[20:15] Nothing happened." She said, "You sure?"
[20:18] I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll be fine."
[20:19] I said, "I'll call you back." You know,
[20:21] so within that call, they took me down
[20:22] to St. hall and I was handed over to the
[20:27] the night uh emergency uh to the night
[20:29] nurses, those emergency unit and
[20:34] they start um doing their checks. They
[20:37] run all the the the the checks and I
[20:42] asked them I said, "Oh, I want to use
[20:43] the restroom again." They say, "You
[20:46] strong enough?" I said, "Oh, yes, I'm
[20:47] strong enough." I walked. They let me in
[20:50] the restroom.
[20:52] I use the restroom. After that again I
[20:56] passed out in that in the restroom. So
[20:59] they noticed that something happened.
[21:00] They rushed in. They said no this this
[21:02] is serious. So they got me again. They
[21:05] all staff came and they lifted me up and
[21:09] I had to go for and and I had to go and
[21:11] do the city scan. After they did the
[21:13] city scan they still were doing other
[21:16] checks. So the nurse came I said oh uh
[21:19] but what is actually happening? He said,
[21:21] "Oh, this is not a good news for you.
[21:23] You have blood clot in your lungs." I
[21:26] said, "Oh my god." I said, "Yeah, that's
[21:28] that's serious." He said, "You only have
[21:31] to do a procedure to go to get those
[21:33] lungs out, those blood clots out." I
[21:36] said, "Wow." So, I called brother one. I
[21:39] explained to brother one the situation.
[21:41] I said, "But um I didn't call my wife. I
[21:44] never wanted to let her panic. So, I
[21:47] just called brother one to let him
[21:49] know." So I said brother one you can
[21:51] also inform my wife that this is the
[21:52] situation I'm in but um God is taking
[21:56] control God is in control of everything.
[21:58] Yeah. So I was just praying. I was just
[22:00] praying and calling on the name of
[22:02] Jesus. Just calling on the name of Jesus
[22:04] that things will be fine. And since
[22:07] things just went fine after everything
[22:09] it happened around um 4 a.m. in the
[22:12] morning around 5 everything was uh done.
[22:15] They do all their checks and 6 I was
[22:17] taken into the room to do the procedure.

[22:22] hours procedure. They did that and all

[22:27] the cloth in her photograph. So I say,

[55:56] that you are the center
[55:58] of our joy. When you are taken out,
[56:02] everything is useless.
[56:04] Everything, Father, is useless. We can

[56:12] the center, nothing holds.
[56:15] Nothing holds. Father,
[56:18] if you're not in the center of our life,
[56:20] nothing holds. If you are not in the
[56:22] center, if you are not the center of
[56:25] this assembly, it can never hold
[56:27] together. If you are not the center of
[56:29] our home, it won't hold together. You
[56:32] are the center of the universe, Lord.
[56:36] and every good and perfect gift come
[56:38] from you. That's the reason why, Father,
[56:41] we give you thanks in all things, Lord.

[56:56] our life.

[57:24] building, Lord, Father God, and go into

[57:29] just be caught, Lord, Father God, by
[57:32] looking at faces, Lord, and and and
[57:34] looking at one another, but may we just
[57:36] go into your presence. May we hear the

[1:02:08] Let's read verse 13 together. And lead
[1:02:10] us not into temptation, but deliver us
[1:02:13] from all evil. For thine is thy kingdom,
[1:02:16] the power, and the glory forever.
[1:02:20] Amen. For if ye forgive men their
[1:02:23] trespasses, your heavenly father will
[1:02:26] fall. Your heavenly father will also
[1:02:29] forgive
[1:02:30] you.
[1:02:32] But if ye forgive not men their
[1:02:35] trespasses, neither will your father

[1:02:48] you come and help us Lord as we speak on
[1:02:50] your behalf in Jesus name. Amen. The
[1:02:53] Lord bless you. You may have your seat.
[1:02:55] Let's go to Romans chapter 1.
[1:02:59] We read that uh uh uh just for the
[1:03:02] scripture reading for us to be able to
[1:03:05] do a scripture reading together. And uh
[1:03:08] uh
[1:03:12] but I want to speak on something this
[1:03:14] morning
[1:03:17] as we
[1:03:19] find a subject to talk about uh
[1:03:23] a father. I'm not too ceremonial. I'm
[1:03:27] trying to be but I don't know how to do
[1:03:29] it. Well, you just find the right
[1:03:32] message for the right vocation. Okay.
[1:03:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:38] And uh maybe when uh brother Jordan come
[1:03:42] from off of leave, he will do that. But
[1:03:44] for now, you just got to bear with me.
[1:03:46] Amen. You'll just got to bear with me.
[1:03:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:52] Amen. Praise the Lord. Before we go into
[1:03:56] our message this morning,
[1:03:58] I was uh
[1:04:01] I was uh
[1:04:08] I was sharing something with uh
[1:04:11] with brother Ariel.
[1:04:13] the last time
[1:04:15] when brother Ary preached what uh what
[1:04:19] an amazing message he brought that day
[1:04:22] and uh uh it was wonderful. We uh
[1:04:27] we enjoy it. We appreciate it. Praise
[1:04:30] the Lord. Amen.
[1:04:33] And uh uh
[1:04:43] But while he was reading the scripture,
[1:04:47] uh it's kind of a teasing him yesterday
[1:04:50] and we were we were fellowshipping. You
[1:04:53] know, I feel I feel blessed. You know, I
[1:04:55] feel very very blessed. Uh couple of
[1:04:58] years ago, it was brother Lloyd. He was
[1:05:01] uh uh our song leader and also
[1:05:06] uh he was uh a son. He was a cold
[1:05:09] preacher. Then brother uh Jordan came on
[1:05:13] the scene. Brother Dan, he's he's always
[1:05:15] here. Amen. Uh he's always here. He's
[1:05:17] the deacon. So we can turn the church
[1:05:20] over to him and go anytime. Praise the
[1:05:22] Lord. So he's a homebody. He's a
[1:05:25] homebody. Uh I've been trying to see
[1:05:28] traveling in him is not too much. He
[1:05:30] looks like a homebody. So uh it's always
[1:05:33] good to have somebody you know is is at
[1:05:35] home. Amen.
[1:05:38] And uh uh but then Lord has to go into
[1:05:44] uh
[1:05:46] going into starting the business and all
[1:05:49] the things and then he moved away in and
[1:05:52] right there the brother uh the Lord
[1:05:56] brought brother Eric along. He was here
[1:05:58] but uh uh now preaching at the time so
[1:06:02] I'm I'm very grateful. uh Luke chapter
[1:06:05] Luke chapter 19, he read the story of
[1:06:08] Zakius.
[1:06:10] And the reason why it caught my mind
[1:06:12] because I was sitting right there where
[1:06:14] brother Kenneth is sitting and uh and he
[1:06:17] was reading the scripture, but when he
[1:06:19] read this part, I sat there, I said to
[1:06:22] myself, I hope the people caught it. I
[1:06:26] just said it to myself like that. I
[1:06:27] said, Lord, I hope the people caught it.
[1:06:30] And uh and after the service, I just
[1:06:33] came back from uh Michigan uh and I was
[1:06:37] so wept out. So I didn't even have
[1:06:38] strength to sing before I would say a
[1:06:40] word. I just left it like that. But I
[1:06:42] kept thinking about it and say I hope
[1:06:44] the people caught it because Wednesday
[1:06:46] night I have just commented on something
[1:06:49] in their line and uh I'd like to share
[1:06:52] with you before we go into our message
[1:06:54] this morning. I could make a whole se
[1:06:57] out of it but uh not today.
[1:07:00] and uh uh right there in in Luke chapter
[1:07:03] 19, let's read from verse 8. Now, what I
[1:07:07] want us to look at, what I want us to
[1:07:09] look at and pay attention to is that
[1:07:12] we've been talking about the lawgiver.
[1:07:14] And what we've been trying to show that
[1:07:17] uh the Lord was actually God expressing
[1:07:20] his desire. He was not giving us a
[1:07:22] commandment because none of us can keep
[1:07:24] God's commandment. Amen. He was just
[1:07:26] trying to make us to know his precept.
[1:07:30] his principle because God works by
[1:07:33] principle.
[1:07:35] All the laws of God are set in
[1:07:37] principle. Whatever you saw, that's what
[1:07:40] you're going to read. Amen. Amen. If you
[1:07:45] really want to understand the law of
[1:07:46] contracts, read the book of proverb.
[1:07:49] Solomon spoke a lot in the law of
[1:07:52] contracts. There is a wicked, there is a
[1:07:54] righteous.
[1:07:56] The wicked king does it. They say they
[1:07:58] suffer. You know, he spoke a lot of the
[1:08:00] law. So, God works in the lord of
[1:08:01] contracts. So, there is a principle here
[1:08:05] that uh that I want us to see. Let's
[1:08:07] read from verse 8. Uh and Zakius stood
[1:08:13] no verse 9 read too much. And Jesus said
[1:08:18] unto him, "This day
[1:08:22] is this scripture fulfilled."
[1:08:26] Amen. And Jesus said unto him, "This day
[1:08:31] is salvation come to this house.
[1:08:37] For so much as he also is a son of
[1:08:43] Abraham." Now underline there. He's a
[1:08:46] son of Abraham. Every one of us, our
[1:08:49] faith goes back to Abraham.
[1:08:52] We are son of Abraham by faith. Are we
[1:08:55] together now? So,
[1:09:06] no, I I went ahead of myself.
[1:09:10] I went ahead of myself. Uh verse 8,
[1:09:12] verse 8 was what I was supposed to read
[1:09:14] because the principle is in verse 8.
[1:09:17] Jesus came. He called Lazarus. He says,
[1:09:19] "I must go to your house." Verse eight,
[1:09:22] Lazarus said, I mean Zakius said, Oh my
[1:09:24] God.
[1:09:26] Zakius said. And Zakius stood and said
[1:09:29] unto the Lord, "Behold, Lord,
[1:09:33] the half of my goals
[1:09:36] I gave to the poor.
[1:09:39] And if I have taken anything from any
[1:09:43] man by force accusation, this is the
[1:09:47] principle, I restore him
[1:09:51] forth."
[1:09:55] Now on Wednesday night, the Wednesday
[1:09:57] before he read this, that's what I sat
[1:10:00] down. I says, "Lord, I hope I hope they
[1:10:02] saw the principle. Let Lazarus is I
[1:10:04] mean, so Lazarus, Jesus,
[1:10:08] Zakius,
[1:10:11] Zakius,
[1:10:13] Zakius, put in your head, brother
[1:10:16] Zakius.
[1:10:19] Amen.
[1:10:23] You're too young to be messing up like
[1:10:24] that.
[1:10:29] Zakius
[1:10:31] is saying there if I've taken anything
[1:10:34] falsely, I will restore it four times.
[1:10:41] Now you can see that he was taught in
[1:10:45] the law of Moses.
[1:10:48] You remember what Moses said in Exodus
[1:10:51] 22?
[1:10:54] Exodus 22. Do we want to read that?
[1:10:57] Verse one.
[1:10:59] If any man shall steal an ox or a sheep
[1:11:03] or kill it
[1:11:06] or sell it,
[1:11:08] he shall
[1:11:10] restore five oxin. If it's an oxin is
[1:11:14] five time.
[1:11:16] If it's a sheep
[1:11:19] is four times.
[1:11:21] Are we together?
[1:11:23] Amen.
[1:11:25] Now, he being a seed of Abraham,
[1:11:31] he's not an ox. He's a sheep.
[1:11:36] We are sheep of his pasture.
[1:11:40] Okay, I just I want to keep the the
[1:11:42] thought uh in context. And uh he says if
[1:11:47] uh Moses so so this is God's principle.
[1:11:51] This is God's statue. This principle is
[1:11:54] a principle of restoration across the
[1:11:57] board.
[1:11:59] God as as as it appears unto the people
[1:12:03] like a commandment to God. I'm giving
[1:12:06] you my principle. When I'm doing any
[1:12:09] form of restoration, I will have to do
[1:12:13] it four times or fourth.
[1:12:17] Are we together?
[1:12:19] Now, we read this also. Nathan came to
[1:12:23] David
[1:12:25] after David has fell with Bsheba.
[1:12:29] 2 Samuel 12 verse 5. And David anger was
[1:12:34] greatly counter against the man because
[1:12:37] Nathan came he wanted to bring David to
[1:12:40] conviction.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:45] So what he did was he took what Moses
[1:12:48] said. A man steal a sheep he must
[1:12:52] restore it four times. He took what
[1:12:54] Moses said and he put it into a parable.
[1:13:00] There was one man that have many sheep
[1:13:02] and there was another man that have one
[1:13:04] sheep.
[1:13:06] Why? Because we are his sheep of his of
[1:13:09] his pasture. So you have to you have to
[1:13:11] keep it in that context.
[1:13:14] Amen.
[1:13:16] And then Natan tell uh uh David and this
[1:13:21] man that have many sheep took this man
[1:13:24] own a sheep. David got angry and he
[1:13:26] said, the Bible says, "And David anger
[1:13:29] was greatly kind of against the man."
[1:13:31] And he said to Nathan, "As the Lord
[1:13:34] liveth, the man that thus the man that
[1:13:37] have done this thing shall surely die."
[1:13:41] When he said that, then Nathan knew that
[1:13:44] I have caught him.
[1:13:47] He's been caught by the word.
[1:13:50] But that's not what the word says. The
[1:13:53] word never said the man that stole a
[1:13:56] sheep must die.
[1:13:58] What did the word says?
[1:14:01] He must restore it. So NATO must keep
[1:14:04] the word. He's a prophet. He must not
[1:14:08] put, he must not add, he must not
[1:14:10] subtract.
[1:14:11] So he tells David, he says, and and and
[1:14:15] and uh uh
[1:14:19] David is speaking here now. The man that
[1:14:21] don't he he must surely die. and he
[1:14:23] shall restore the lamb forth. Why?
[1:14:27] Because David also is a student of the
[1:14:29] word. He knows that is what God's word
[1:14:32] require.
[1:14:36] Are you seeing the principle?
[1:14:39] It's a principle that runs across the
[1:14:41] board.
[1:14:43] It runs across the board. It runs It
[1:14:45] runs into our life. It runs into our
[1:14:48] redemption. It runs into Israel
[1:14:50] redemption. Uh uh uh uh uh.
[1:14:55] Come on you now preacher. Do better than
[1:14:57] this. Genesis chapter 15. If you read
[1:15:01] Genesis chapter 15 from verse 13 to
[1:15:04] verse uh 16, God told Abraham, are we
[1:15:08] together?
[1:15:10] He told Abraham verse uh Genesis chapter
[1:15:14] 15.
[1:15:20] Now the reason why I'm trying to do this
[1:15:22] is because if we don't if we don't
[1:15:26] understand the principle by which God
[1:15:29] works with brother Brandham in a message
[1:15:32] key to the door he called it key.
[1:15:34] Brother Brandham says the way he was
[1:15:36] able to find the church is messenger of
[1:15:39] every age because there's a keystone
[1:15:41] revelation. What is that keystone
[1:15:43] revelation? It's a principle.
[1:15:46] When God told Moses, Exodus chapter 25
[1:15:49] to build a tabernacle, he said, "Build
[1:15:51] it just like the faction." He gave Moses
[1:15:54] a pattern. That pattern is a principle.
[1:16:00] That's the way the tabernacle was built.
[1:16:02] That's the way Solomon built his temple.
[1:16:05] That is the way that God is dealing with
[1:16:07] us. That is the way the new Jerusalem is
[1:16:09] built because it's a principle.
[1:16:14] Are we together? Now look at this now.
[1:16:18] Genesis chapter 15 and uh verse 13. Look
[1:16:21] right here. Uh uh I just want to go over
[1:16:24] this before I get into my little thing I
[1:16:26] want to share with you. And he said to
[1:16:28] Abraham, God is speaking to know for
[1:16:30] sure it that the sea shall your seed
[1:16:34] shall be in a strange land
[1:16:38] that is not theirs and shall serve them.
[1:16:42] And they shall afflict them for how many
[1:16:45] years?
[1:16:46] Four
[1:16:48] 400 years. Four generation.
[1:16:52] What is that? Restoration.
[1:16:57] Amen.
[1:16:59] Because they were stolen out of their
[1:17:01] land. They will be restored back after
[1:17:05] four generation.
[1:17:08] Now see what he says here. You can read
[1:17:11] the the the the rest of it. And uh uh
[1:17:16] verse 15, thou shalt go to thy father in
[1:17:19] in peace. Thou shall be buried in a good
[1:17:23] old age. But in the fourth generation,
[1:17:30] the first was Abraham, second was Isaac,
[1:17:34] third was Jacob, the fourth was Jacob's
[1:17:37] sons.
[1:17:41] Moses was a son of Levi or the son of
[1:17:45] Amra. So it was in the fourth generation
[1:17:48] that God came down to do what? Restore
[1:17:51] them back to their land.
[1:17:55] Are we together?
[1:17:57] Restoration of the bride in the book of
[1:18:00] Joah chapter 2. What did the prophet Jo
[1:18:03] say? What the locusters, the conqueror
[1:18:06] wound, the caterpillar,
[1:18:08] how many beasts there was four.
[1:18:12] And God say I were restored.
[1:18:18] Are we together? Are you seeing the
[1:18:20] principle? David said in a psalm,
[1:18:24] restore my soul.
[1:18:29] How is God restoring our soul?
[1:18:32] Justification. sanctification, baptism
[1:18:35] of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[1:18:37] himself.
[1:18:40] It brings us back to complete
[1:18:42] restoration.
[1:18:44] Are you seeing the principle?
[1:18:50] Are we together?
[1:18:57] Masterpiece. Brother, we preach
[1:18:59] masterpiece and tell us that God
[1:19:02] masterpiece
[1:19:03] was placed on full foundation. What did
[1:19:07] he said? Abraham of faith, Isaac of
[1:19:10] love, Jacob of grace, Joseph of
[1:19:13] perfection
[1:19:16] to bring us back, to bring Israel back.
[1:19:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:25] is a principle not just for knowledge
[1:19:30] but it's a principle
[1:19:32] that is that is uh that is recognized
[1:19:36] in the way that God is dealing with us.
[1:19:41] Amen.
[1:19:43] Are we together?
[1:19:47] So, let's go to what we want to talk
[1:19:48] about this morning.
[1:19:51] That just uh uh
[1:19:55] was over my head. I was just thinking
[1:19:56] about it, Lord. And and I will you know
[1:20:00] Jesus said uh the Holy Ghost will remind
[1:20:02] you. So now if I start preaching about
[1:20:05] it next morning again, I'm just
[1:20:06] reminding you,
[1:20:08] okay? I'm just reminding you this
[1:20:11] morning. uh with the help of the Lord. I
[1:20:14] want to speak on a little subject I
[1:20:16] entitled God our father. God our father.
[1:20:20] Romans chapter 7. Romans chapter 7.
[1:20:26] Romans chapter 7. God our father.
[1:20:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:33] No. Romans chapter 1 verse 7. Romans
[1:20:37] chapter 1 verse 7. God our father.
[1:20:54] Romans chapter 1 verse 7. Paul in his
[1:20:57] greetings to the church in Rome.
[1:21:00] To all that be in Rome, beloved of God,
[1:21:04] called to be saints.
[1:21:06] Grace to you and peace from God our
[1:21:10] father
[1:21:12] and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:21:15] Now this is the book of Romans. If you
[1:21:18] go to most of all Paul greetings beside
[1:21:22] Hebrew and there is a reason why Paul
[1:21:26] changed his greetings in the book of
[1:21:28] Hebrew
[1:21:30] because his the book of Hebrew his
[1:21:32] message was identified to the Jews. They
[1:21:35] had not believed Jesus. So he had to
[1:21:38] come up with a greetings. The God in
[1:21:41] Sundra times that spoke to our fathers
[1:21:45] in these last days. So his greeting was
[1:21:49] completely different. But if you look in
[1:21:51] in in in in Romans, you look in
[1:21:54] Corinthian, you look in Philippian, you
[1:21:56] look in Paul always have the same form
[1:22:00] of greetings. 11 times Paul used these
[1:22:03] greetings.
[1:22:05] Grace to you and peace from God our
[1:22:10] father.
[1:22:11] 11 times he used it. Grace and peace
[1:22:17] to you
[1:22:19] from God our father.
[1:22:23] Are we together?
[1:22:25] So we want to talk on
[1:22:29] uh a subject called God our father.
[1:22:33] Also in Paul episode
[1:22:36] he had uh he had different forms of
[1:22:38] greetings. He had different forms of
[1:22:40] greeting. Let's let's just dwell on this
[1:22:42] one because we don't have much time. But
[1:22:45] there was another one I was looking at
[1:22:47] where he says uh uh God the father of
[1:22:55] God the f God God and the father of.
[1:23:01] I was going to talk on God the father of
[1:23:03] but uh uh I just I just changed it.
[1:23:07] Let's talk about God our father. Praise
[1:23:10] the Lord. Because uh the the reason the
[1:23:13] reason that is is important is that you
[1:23:17] have to know where Paul came from.
[1:23:21] He says, "I was a Pharisees of the
[1:23:23] Pharisees."
[1:23:25] He says, "I was one that was taught by
[1:23:27] Galia, one of the best teachers we had."
[1:23:32] So this young man was taught in the
[1:23:35] Torah
[1:23:37] from cover to cover.
[1:23:40] But for him to be given the revelation
[1:23:42] of Jesus Christ
[1:23:45] after his experience on the road of
[1:23:48] Damascus, it changed his life and it
[1:23:51] will change your life. The revelation of
[1:23:54] Jesus Christ will change your life. You
[1:23:57] can never be the same. That's right.
[1:24:00] Amen. You can never read God's word the
[1:24:03] same. You can never live the same.
[1:24:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:08] We we come short of our responsibility
[1:24:11] to God because of a lack of revelation.
[1:24:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:18] You cannot live above your revelation.
[1:24:24] It's is as as we talk about father vain
[1:24:27] is is is how much a child understand
[1:24:32] this man being his father or being her
[1:24:35] father. That's how much she relates to
[1:24:38] him.
[1:24:42] Are we together?
[1:24:45] There's a there's a young lady that sent
[1:24:47] me the uh the Father Day greeting this
[1:24:51] morning
[1:24:53] and uh and I mean it was just it was
[1:24:55] filled with filled with blood worse.
[1:24:58] And one thing she said in there is they
[1:25:00] had a
[1:25:03] uh I I never I never experienced father
[1:25:06] love because of things that happened.
[1:25:08] Never went into detail and uh but uh uh
[1:25:13] uh since uh since you being my father uh
[1:25:18] you know you have shown me unconditional
[1:25:20] love. Now I I don't know how much uh uh
[1:25:24] you know I don't know how much that is
[1:25:27] truth to me.
[1:25:29] Praise the Lord. But I'm I'm just saying
[1:25:31] it from the place that there is based on
[1:25:34] the relationship.
[1:25:36] So your relationship
[1:25:39] is your revelation
[1:25:43] in another sense. Okay. Your
[1:25:46] relationship to an individual is your
[1:25:48] revelation of the person.
[1:25:52] Your relationship to your parents is
[1:25:55] your revelation of them. If you just see
[1:25:58] them as people that brought you in this
[1:25:59] word and uh and that just oh I just need
[1:26:02] to grow up and get out of here.
[1:26:05] You can't help it.
[1:26:08] That's how much understanding you have.
[1:26:12] Are we together? So Paul used all of
[1:26:15] these words. He used these things in the
[1:26:18] scripture. uh uh uh because
[1:26:23] of the revelation he had when he went to
[1:26:27] the backside of the desert. The way that
[1:26:29] God dealt with him, it changed his life
[1:26:34] because go to your concordance
[1:26:37] quote God the Father,
[1:26:40] you will see that Israel speaks about
[1:26:44] God but is God of our fathers. So when
[1:26:49] they say God the father, they are
[1:26:52] referring to their fathers. We was the
[1:26:54] patriot.
[1:26:56] They they never had a revelation
[1:27:00] of relating to the Jehovah.
[1:27:04] Amen. They never had a revelation of
[1:27:08] relating to the invisible God at
[1:27:10] fathers.
[1:27:12] They never had that revelation. Jesus
[1:27:15] was the one that brought that
[1:27:16] revelation. Yeah. And that was what he
[1:27:19] taught in Matthew chapter 5 and six.
[1:27:25] Your father,
[1:27:27] he says, when you prayed,
[1:27:30] it used to be the God of Abraham, the
[1:27:32] God of Isaac, the God of Jacob,
[1:27:35] but now when you pray,
[1:27:38] say our father.
[1:27:41] Do you know what a struggle it is to
[1:27:44] call somebody father
[1:27:46] that you have never known as a father?
[1:27:50] You know what a struggle it is? It takes
[1:27:52] a birth. It takes it takes an inner
[1:27:56] change.
[1:28:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:06] I mean for for us for us Gentiles and we
[1:28:09] we take it uh that that my daddy that
[1:28:11] that that my papa we we take it and we
[1:28:13] we give God all you know all the uh uh
[1:28:16] the the law of names but in in in most
[1:28:19] cases
[1:28:21] it is not with much revelation either
[1:28:25] because there is not reference and
[1:28:26] respect to some of the things we are
[1:28:28] saying.
[1:28:30] God I'm a my buddy.
[1:28:33] God I'm a my papa. Some of them they are
[1:28:36] just slogan
[1:28:38] you know and some of them sounds very
[1:28:39] disrespectful even.
[1:28:44] Are we together?
[1:28:47] But this was this was a this was a very
[1:28:52] heavyweight teaching when Jesus was
[1:28:56] telling these people
[1:28:59] your father seth in secret.
[1:29:04] He will reward you openly.
[1:29:08] Be perfect as your heavenly father is
[1:29:11] perfect.
[1:29:15] Are we together?
[1:29:21] So Paul out of his revelation out of the
[1:29:24] experience he had three years at the
[1:29:26] backside of the Arabia desert it has
[1:29:29] affected him so much so much
[1:29:34] that he's going to bring to these people
[1:29:37] you know he's going to bring to these
[1:29:39] people the way that God is dealing with
[1:29:41] him
[1:29:45] beloved God called to be saints. Grace
[1:29:49] to you and peace from God our father.
[1:29:56] From God our father.
[1:29:59] For him to use it in all his episode and
[1:30:04] use it so freely. It shows how much his
[1:30:09] understanding has been changed.
[1:30:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:15] Amen. It show how much his understanding
[1:30:18] has been changed.
[1:30:25] Are we together?
[1:30:28] God our father.
[1:30:32] Jesus was the one that brought it. That
[1:30:35] was the first teaching. Matthew chapter
[1:30:38] 4, Jesus just came from the mountain. 40
[1:30:40] days and 40 night he just fasted.
[1:30:43] Chapter five, he was on the mountain
[1:30:45] teaching. He took them up the mountain.
[1:30:47] He started teaching. So that was his
[1:30:50] first teaching. That was his first
[1:30:52] dollar, his first uh h major discourse
[1:30:58] was to tell them these things. You have
[1:31:01] heard in the Lord, but now I say to you,
[1:31:05] praise the Lord. I believe all you I
[1:31:08] believe all of these Pharisees that were
[1:31:10] there, they were just they were just
[1:31:12] grinding their teeth and who is this man
[1:31:19] to to I mean uh uh uh uh speak about the
[1:31:23] law like this. Are we together?
[1:31:28] And then so it's it's chapter five, six
[1:31:31] and seven he goes through with with this
[1:31:34] discuss. So I want us to to pay
[1:31:36] attention to it. And just like we talk
[1:31:39] about uh uh we we talk about
[1:31:45] uh
[1:31:47] the Lord giver
[1:31:50] and how the Lord
[1:31:53] was to expose our sinful nature and give
[1:31:57] us a desire for a redeemer.
[1:32:01] Amen. The Lord,
[1:32:05] the purpose of the law was to make us to
[1:32:07] know that we need God.
[1:32:12] Amen.
[1:32:14] It will it will it will it will condemn
[1:32:17] you. It put you in prison and throw away
[1:32:20] the key.
[1:32:22] You need the grace of God to come down
[1:32:24] and open the door and set you free
[1:32:28] because that Lord can bind you. It can
[1:32:31] it can put you in a state where you live
[1:32:33] to condemnation and you you even take
[1:32:36] your life because you believe that you
[1:32:39] are not good to live. That's what the
[1:32:42] Lord will do.
[1:32:46] He can put you in praise and leave you
[1:32:48] there. It takes the grace of God to
[1:32:49] bring you out. So as we as we were
[1:32:52] looking at this
[1:32:54] as we were looking at this
[1:32:56] I was I was meditating on it in the week
[1:33:01] and I want to share this with you before
[1:33:03] we go further. Let's read this familiar
[1:33:07] quote from uh uh
[1:33:10] uh that day on Calvary.
[1:33:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:17] Let's read this familiar quote on that
[1:33:20] day of cal on uh that day on Calvary.
[1:33:23] Okay, we start year. Now the first thing
[1:33:25] I want to say Jesus never lay for
[1:33:29] himself.
[1:33:31] He spend he was spent for others. Are we
[1:33:36] together?
[1:33:41] Amen.
[1:33:45] He was spent for others. That's
[1:33:48] perfectly eternal life.
[1:33:52] Are we together?
[1:33:54] Jesus never live for himself. He was
[1:33:57] spent for others. That's perfectly
[1:33:59] eternal life. When you say you go you
[1:34:02] you go to church and you do good things,
[1:34:06] that's fine. But when you live your life
[1:34:09] for yourself, you having God eternal
[1:34:13] life.
[1:34:14] Are we together?
[1:34:16] Brother Kenneth, are you with me? Okay.
[1:34:21] You having got internal life. Internet
[1:34:24] life is living for others.
[1:34:28] Are we together? Amen.
[1:34:31] Now
[1:34:33] tell me if you don't see that in Matthew
[1:34:36] chapter 5
[1:34:41] look
[1:34:43] before
[1:34:45] we came here
[1:34:48] when we talk about this father as we
[1:34:50] will look into it he is our or h the the
[1:34:54] the originator
[1:34:58] he's the origin of our being are we
[1:35:01] together?
[1:35:03] He's the beginning of our existence.
[1:35:06] That's the reason why the book of uh
[1:35:09] Genesis begin with in the beginning God.
[1:35:15] He's the very beginning.
[1:35:18] Amen.
[1:35:20] And he tells us in his word
[1:35:23] before you pray, I know what you want to
[1:35:26] pray about.
[1:35:29] So he knows our thoughts. Praise the
[1:35:32] Lord. Now Matthew chapter 5, Jesus was
[1:35:37] trying to reress
[1:35:40] our serving God approach.
[1:35:45] Are we together?
[1:35:49] Because we come to church, we come to
[1:35:51] serve God. We we come to church, we come
[1:35:53] to praise God.
[1:35:56] Are we together? But see how he brought
[1:35:59] it to the disciples. See how he taught
[1:36:01] him. Let men see your good work
[1:36:07] and do what? Glorify your father.
[1:36:11] Amen. So your good work is not what you
[1:36:15] do to the father. It's what we do to one
[1:36:18] another.
[1:36:22] Amen.
[1:36:24] So to serve God is to serve people, is
[1:36:29] to serve humanity.
[1:36:33] We can be we can be boxed in our head,
[1:36:36] you know, uh uh uh to keep the
[1:36:39] commandment and and and do right and yet
[1:36:42] we don't have feelings for people around
[1:36:44] us.
[1:36:49] But in Matthew chapter 5, he's changing
[1:36:52] the whole thing. He says, "You come to
[1:36:54] the tabernacle and you bring your
[1:36:57] offering and you remember there's a man
[1:36:59] sitting in a seat that you have wrong."
[1:37:03] He said, "Leave it and and go settle
[1:37:05] it." That's truth worship.
[1:37:09] When you are in communion and fellowship
[1:37:12] with the people around you, then the f
[1:37:14] you are in fellowship with the father.
[1:37:21] Are we together?
[1:37:24] Because it's so easy. It's so easy for
[1:37:27] us to to to to fuss at home. It's so
[1:37:30] easy for us to control oursel because I
[1:37:32] mean we're not here for a long time. We
[1:37:33] just here for maybe two three hours.
[1:37:35] Maybe I'm going to drag here a little
[1:37:37] bit today.
[1:37:40] Amen.
[1:37:44] And you know the good thing about it?
[1:37:46] I'm doing the talking and you just
[1:37:47] sitting.
[1:37:50] If we were all allowed to talk, attitude
[1:37:52] will will be displayed.
[1:37:55] Oh, you too loud. I can't hear. I can't
[1:37:57] that other person too talking too loud.
[1:37:58] I'm going out.
[1:38:06] You see? And that's the reason why I say
[1:38:08] all the time,
[1:38:10] if you come here to serve your God, make
[1:38:13] sure he's our God.
[1:38:18] We don't have room for others.
[1:38:23] I just come to serve my God. I just come
[1:38:25] to serve my God.
[1:38:29] Are we together?
[1:38:35] You see that
[1:38:37] all true
[1:38:41] that Christian life is not
[1:38:44] actually living for God like the way we
[1:38:48] say it
[1:38:51] because as a child of God as a seed of
[1:38:54] God you can you can you can surprise
[1:38:58] God.
[1:39:00] Amen. You can't disappoint him.
[1:39:04] He knows the very fiber of your court.
[1:39:07] He knows how much you can take.
[1:39:13] Are we together?
[1:39:18] You see, and that is the reason why
[1:39:20] Jesus approached this thing from inside.
[1:39:24] Blessed are the peacemaker. Blessed are
[1:39:27] the meek. Blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:39:30] which mean clean the inside. You will be
[1:39:34] able to handle your outside.
[1:39:42] Are we together?
[1:39:50] So, so I mean I mean this this comes
[1:39:52] real to us. Internet life is living for
[1:39:55] other. They prove it when it comes in
[1:39:58] the lamb of God which is Jesus Christ.
[1:40:00] He live and he had eternal life because
[1:40:03] he did not live for himself. He live for
[1:40:06] others.
[1:40:09] And you and you receive eternal life by
[1:40:11] receiving that day. And you don't live
[1:40:15] for yourself no more. You live for
[1:40:17] others.
[1:40:20] Someone said, "How can how can you stand
[1:40:22] and let and and and let anybody call you
[1:40:25] such a by name? You don't lay for
[1:40:29] yourself, you live for others."
[1:40:32] You see, and and and that is the reason
[1:40:34] why
[1:40:37] when the society tells you make yourself
[1:40:39] happy,
[1:40:42] it's not in God's word.
[1:40:46] It's not in God's word.
[1:40:50] is a society term
[1:40:56] because I mean you can't find happiness
[1:40:58] any word. So they say well just make
[1:41:01] yourself happy. Try it.
[1:41:05] Try it. Tell me how how long it last.
[1:41:10] Amen. Tell me how long it last. There is
[1:41:15] nothing you can do by yourself that will
[1:41:18] make you happy. If you really want to
[1:41:21] get happy, you got to get into a mess.
[1:41:26] So when people say make themsel happy,
[1:41:28] they leave their family. They leave the
[1:41:30] people that they love. They go into the
[1:41:32] street to find people that don't know
[1:41:33] them, people that, you know, don't care
[1:41:35] about them, and they start jumping with
[1:41:37] them. Hey, I'm making myself happy.
[1:41:39] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:41:43] But it has a time though. When the time
[1:41:46] end, the happiness gone, then you s you
[1:41:48] going back home.
[1:42:00] You don't live for yourself, you live
[1:42:02] for others. That you might redeem a man.
[1:42:06] You become a son. And the trouble of it
[1:42:09] is that the church has forgotten
[1:42:13] they were sons. You are son.
[1:42:16] You are taking Christ's place. You are a
[1:42:19] son. So don't lay for yourself. Lay for
[1:42:23] others. Well, brother Brandham, can I
[1:42:26] lay for this brother because he's such a
[1:42:29] nice man?
[1:42:32] That's not it.
[1:42:35] lay for the man who hates you.
[1:42:38] Is that not Matthew chapter 5?
[1:42:43] That's Matthew chapter 5.
[1:42:47] That's exactly what Jesus was teaching
[1:42:49] in Matthew chapter 5.
[1:42:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:55] Then then pretty soon we will begin to
[1:42:58] appreciate why God put people in our
[1:43:00] lives
[1:43:03] and how much we must cherish the ones
[1:43:05] that are around us.
[1:43:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:11] The same way there are things you don't
[1:43:13] like about them. That is very same way
[1:43:15] there are things that you don't like
[1:43:17] about yourself. If you want to be
[1:43:19] earnest,
[1:43:24] are we together?
[1:43:29] Where am I going this morning?
[1:43:33] Live for the man who hates you. Live for
[1:43:35] the person uh uh uh who will kill you if
[1:43:39] they could.
[1:43:43] That's what
[1:43:46] they done to him to Christ. They killed
[1:43:49] him and he died that he might save them.
[1:43:55] That's eternal life.
[1:43:59] That's in your bosom.
[1:44:02] You are facing heaven then.
[1:44:05] But you sacrifice your own things. Give
[1:44:08] them up. Like the sheep gave his hold.
[1:44:12] You look on towards Calvary. I hope this
[1:44:16] helped you to get to a place.
[1:44:20] And where is that place? In your spirit.
[1:44:25] In your mind.
[1:44:27] Because the battle is in your mind.
[1:44:31] It can sound it can sound good. Oh yeah,
[1:44:33] that's right. Praise God. Oh, that's
[1:44:35] truth.
[1:44:37] The real test is out there.
[1:44:41] The real test is when you get home.
[1:44:46] Are we together?
[1:44:49] So you see, we need to get to a place
[1:44:53] because we fell from a place.
[1:45:01] I hope this helped you get to a place.
[1:45:04] That's what the tabernacle, that's what
[1:45:06] all the people has got to do to find out
[1:45:09] what you are and and and and what's the
[1:45:12] purpose? What's the purpose? Church
[1:45:15] isn't going to church just to play
[1:45:18] music, sing song. Church is a place
[1:45:21] where correction, judgment begin in the
[1:45:24] house of God. We must reckon ourself
[1:45:26] dead and alive to Christ. Then he made a
[1:45:31] way that we could sacrifice ourself to
[1:45:34] his service to follow him. If we follow
[1:45:38] him, we lead the life that he lived.
[1:45:43] That's wonderful.
[1:45:45] That's wonderful.
[1:45:47] Are we together?
[1:45:50] So we realize that uh uh uh life in
[1:45:53] itself is a responsibility.
[1:45:56] Amen.
[1:45:58] for you to wake up in the morning and be
[1:46:00] alive, be alive, to be living, is a
[1:46:04] responsibility.
[1:46:05] Praise the Lord. Amen. Unless you are a
[1:46:09] toddler Lord or some of the little ones
[1:46:11] where the parents have to help brush
[1:46:13] their teeth, you got to get up and go
[1:46:14] brush your own teeth.
[1:46:17] Let's start from there.
[1:46:22] Life is a responsibility. So when we
[1:46:24] when we when we look at this subject of
[1:46:27] God our father
[1:46:30] is uh is it's a revelation that takes us
[1:46:34] to our origin.
[1:46:37] Praise the Lord. And you see it that is
[1:46:40] the only way your destiny come in sight
[1:46:44] when you know your origin.
[1:46:48] when you have a revelation of your
[1:46:51] origin.
[1:46:53] Praise the Lord. Because what we did
[1:46:56] just now, we have just gone through a
[1:46:58] principle of restoration.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:04] And the principle of restoration is to
[1:47:06] do what? To restore. Take you back.
[1:47:12] Is to take you back. So if you know your
[1:47:15] origin,
[1:47:17] you can have your destinate insight
[1:47:23] because you know no matter what goes
[1:47:25] wrong, I know where I came from. I know
[1:47:28] where I'm going back to.
[1:47:33] Praise the Lord. Amen. You see that's
[1:47:35] the reason why by the new birth we don't
[1:47:37] hold too much to this flesh and our
[1:47:39] national identity, our tribal identity
[1:47:43] because that is not my origin.
[1:47:47] I had to pass that way but that is not
[1:47:50] my origin. Just like how Jesus had to
[1:47:53] pass the weight of Zakius, he had to
[1:47:55] pass the weight of the woman of Samra. I
[1:47:58] had to pass the weight of Liberia. But
[1:48:00] that's not my origin.
[1:48:07] Are we together? The word has come to
[1:48:10] show me my origin. I can say God my
[1:48:15] father.
[1:48:19] Praise the Lord. What can go wrong?
[1:48:23] That's what Jesus trying to bring to
[1:48:25] these people. What can go wrong
[1:48:28] when a son comes back home?
[1:48:31] What can go wrong?
[1:48:34] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:48:38] Oh, when a seven comes back, he can be
[1:48:40] fired.
[1:48:43] Amen. That's why the Lord makes you, it
[1:48:45] makes you a seven. You can be fired, you
[1:48:47] can be thrown out, but when a son comes
[1:48:50] back home, what can go wrong?
[1:48:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:00] So you see, he's bringing us to a place
[1:49:02] of intimacy with the father that when we
[1:49:06] when we get down to commune with him,
[1:49:08] it's not on the level of grammar.
[1:49:11] It's not the level of grammar. It's not
[1:49:13] the words. It must be something from
[1:49:16] inside. Tell him your feelings.
[1:49:19] You You made me. You know what I'm
[1:49:21] dealing with.
[1:49:24] It runs deep. It becomes real. Amen.
[1:49:31] Then thinking about the seven redemptive
[1:49:32] are Jehovah, you are Shama, you are you
[1:49:34] are you are Tesen, you are ha you are
[1:49:40] all of those things they are wonderful
[1:49:43] but you could stay right in there. It's
[1:49:46] almost you say I know you I know you and
[1:49:50] as you are calling you are telling the
[1:49:52] person you know you are going back.
[1:50:01] Are we together?
[1:50:05] God our father
[1:50:09] when you pray said our father.
[1:50:16] Hallelujah.
[1:50:23] That word speaks of an establisher.
[1:50:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:29] A founder. You you hear it is it's used.
[1:50:33] This is the father of math
[1:50:37] which is is is the man that discover it
[1:50:39] or the man that establish it or
[1:50:41] something like that.
[1:50:44] But with God is more than that.
[1:50:47] Are we together?
[1:50:50] is more than that.
[1:50:54] He's our father.
[1:50:56] Praise the Lord. He's the beginner
[1:51:03] with the father. That's where everything
[1:51:06] begins.
[1:51:10] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:51:16] Many of us might fail in our
[1:51:19] responsibility
[1:51:21] of uh of fatherhood.
[1:51:25] But you see
[1:51:28] if we can
[1:51:31] fall back to the father.
[1:51:35] Amen.
[1:51:37] If we can fall back to the father
[1:51:40] because our society
[1:51:43] that we are dealing with that we are
[1:51:45] living in because this institution this
[1:51:49] fatherhood institution has been
[1:51:52] destroyed.
[1:51:56] It has been destroyed.
[1:52:00] Are we together?
[1:52:02] Amen.
[1:52:03] The fatherhood uh h uh institution
[1:52:08] in this age is only considered as born a
[1:52:13] child meeting with a woman getting her
[1:52:16] pregnant she born a child I'm a father
[1:52:20] but a more than that
[1:52:23] praise the lord
[1:52:27] and more than that think about god our
[1:52:31] Father,
[1:52:34] think about God our father be being the
[1:52:38] beginner. Think about it this way.
[1:52:43] When he stepped out of
[1:52:47] intern being, an internal being and he
[1:52:50] wanted to begin time.
[1:52:57] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:03] He knew that some will love mountains.
[1:53:10] He knew that some will love rivers,
[1:53:14] some will love forests.
[1:53:18] Before we will ever get here,
[1:53:24] he's making preparation. He's shipping
[1:53:27] things before we will ever get here.
[1:53:37] That position of a father being a
[1:53:40] provider. You look at Timothy. Tim says,
[1:53:43] "If a man cannot provide for his home,
[1:53:47] that word provider,
[1:53:51] that word provider
[1:53:54] is a word that comes from
[1:53:58] a sea.
[1:54:00] You foresee."
[1:54:03] So God our father foresaw what we were
[1:54:06] like
[1:54:09] what will make us comfortable.
[1:54:16] Are we together?
[1:54:19] He f
[1:54:21] what we were like what would make us
[1:54:23] comfortable.
[1:54:25] The fruits, the flowers, the colors.
[1:54:39] Because out of him we came.
[1:54:43] Are we together?
[1:54:45] Out of him we came.
[1:54:53] It's a responsibility.
[1:54:57] Fatherhood is a responsibility like
[1:54:59] everything in life.
[1:55:02] Amen.
[1:55:05] But this is one of the the the the
[1:55:08] highest responsibility
[1:55:10] and I believe it is the responsibility
[1:55:14] word the nation the word has still at
[1:55:18] large.
[1:55:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:23] That's where the word the nation has
[1:55:25] still alive. We having all of these mix
[1:55:27] up going on you know uh uh uh we can
[1:55:31] comfort ourself that Jesus said it will
[1:55:33] be like in the days of Sodom but we have
[1:55:35] all of these mixture in people mind
[1:55:39] is because the right representation
[1:55:44] of fatherhood is not displayed.
[1:55:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:52] Amen. You think about it. You think
[1:55:55] about it. You think about it. You
[1:55:57] getting a revelation and an
[1:55:59] understanding that God is my father.
[1:56:06] Jesus introduces to us. He closed his
[1:56:09] time here on earth. St. John chapter
[1:56:12] let's let's look in the book of St.
[1:56:14] John. Let me let me take another another
[1:56:17] thing here then and uh
[1:56:20] uh
[1:56:22] that will help us. Praise the Lord. Are
[1:56:23] we together?
[1:56:28] St. John chapter 20.
[1:56:38] When Jesus resurrected
[1:56:40] out of the grave,
[1:56:47] when he came out, he said unto the
[1:56:50] woman, Mary, he said, touch me not, for
[1:56:53] I am not ascended to my father, but go
[1:56:57] to my brethrens and say unto them, I
[1:56:59] ascend to my father and your father,
[1:57:05] to my God
[1:57:07] and your God.
[1:57:10] So he's God our father.
[1:57:14] Are we together? Amen. So you see just
[1:57:18] just that just that revelation just that
[1:57:22] understanding singing into your heart
[1:57:25] now the understanding of I'm a church
[1:57:27] member or I'm a Christian
[1:57:30] because being a son of God is more than
[1:57:32] being a Christian. Amen.
[1:57:35] Just that understanding is enough to
[1:57:38] bring you to conviction. Amen. On the
[1:57:41] level of your choice
[1:57:45] if God is my father, am I am I best
[1:57:48] representing him by what I'm doing?
[1:57:54] Are we together? Amen.
[1:57:56] So just that understanding.
[1:58:06] Are we together?
[1:58:09] God our father.
[1:58:13] What a mighty God we serve.
[1:58:16] Amen.
[1:58:17] What a beautiful Jesus we serve.
[1:58:21] Hallelujah.
[1:58:24] that God will bring
[1:58:27] such an understanding to us,
[1:58:32] not as a requirement, not as a Lord,
[1:58:38] but as something to bring us out of our
[1:58:42] fallen state, something to bring us out
[1:58:45] of condemnation.
[1:58:48] Look at the scripture there with the
[1:58:50] prodical son. The Bible says while he
[1:58:52] was eating in the trash, he remembered.
[1:58:57] The Bible say he remembered. The
[1:59:00] scripture actually use the statement he
[1:59:02] came to himself
[1:59:08] that me eating in pig pen.
[1:59:13] Even the servants in my father house
[1:59:15] don't eat this food.
[1:59:17] Just that understanding that I have a
[1:59:20] father,
[1:59:23] the status of my father is better than
[1:59:25] this condition.
[1:59:28] That's what took him out of the grace.
[1:59:31] That's what the revelation of Jesus
[1:59:33] Christ do to the believer.
[1:59:36] Just that understanding, it it it
[1:59:38] elevates your life. I can't live like
[1:59:41] this. I can't live on a condemnation. I
[1:59:44] can't live in sin.
[1:59:50] So you see you are not living a life
[1:59:52] watching people who looking at me. No
[1:59:55] you are living a life because you are
[1:59:57] considering where I came from.
[2:00:03] Who am I?
[2:00:07] God our father.
[2:00:13] What can go wrong?
[2:00:16] Praise the Lord. What can go wrong?
[2:00:22] When a son comes back to a father, what
[2:00:26] can go wrong?
[2:00:31] Amazing grace. How sweet they are sound.
[2:00:35] Amen.
[2:00:37] Amazing grace, how sweet they sound.
[2:00:40] Thou save a wret like me.
[2:00:48] It's a responsibility people. Brother
[2:00:50] Bam said this in the message of running
[2:00:52] away from the presence of the Lord.
[2:00:57] He said this. He said, "And yet we find
[2:01:00] an example of all of us, every one of
[2:01:04] us, we are always,
[2:01:07] we always are running from something.
[2:01:14] We run from trouble.
[2:01:16] We run from responsibilities.
[2:01:19] We are prone to death.
[2:01:23] We are more prone to run than to stand
[2:01:27] and face it.
[2:01:31] Praise the Lord. That's the reason why
[2:01:33] God has not given us a spirit of fear.
[2:01:37] Amen. Because most of the time we are
[2:01:40] running because we are afraid.
[2:01:44] It's not what is coming after you that
[2:01:47] is chasing you. It's what is in you. The
[2:01:50] fear.
[2:01:53] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:01:56] Daniel never had no fear in him.
[2:02:01] He knew he was in the line of duty.
[2:02:07] So they didn't know how to drag him to
[2:02:09] the lion den.
[2:02:12] Praise the Lord. He walked there.
[2:02:16] The Hebrew boys never had no fear in
[2:02:19] them because they even testify even if
[2:02:23] God do not deliver us.
[2:02:29] So they didn't have to whip them there.
[2:02:35] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:38] They were they were before the man that
[2:02:40] took them there. But yet the fire
[2:02:42] consumed those men and never consumed
[2:02:44] them.
[2:02:46] Are we together?
[2:02:50] I don't know whether you have ever been
[2:02:51] in that experience where you have
[2:02:54] something coming after you. You are
[2:02:57] running and out of a something take up
[2:03:00] in you and you turn to face it. I don't
[2:03:03] know if you have ever been in there.
[2:03:06] something just to take over you. So you
[2:03:09] realize that it was not more of the
[2:03:12] thing that was coming that you were
[2:03:13] afraid but it's the fear.
[2:03:21] Are we together? He has not given us the
[2:03:23] spirit of fear.
[2:03:26] He has given us faith,
[2:03:30] love,
[2:03:32] joy,
[2:03:33] boldness,
[2:03:35] s mind. What is a s mind? A mind that is
[2:03:39] on the word.
[2:03:45] We find an example of all of us. Every
[2:03:47] one of us, we we always are running from
[2:03:51] something. We run from trouble. We run
[2:03:52] from responsibility. We are prone to run
[2:03:55] then to stand and face it out. Everybody
[2:03:58] has got to face certain responsibility.
[2:04:03] Amen.
[2:04:06] When you come to the choice of a wife to
[2:04:08] marry to choose a husband, you got to
[2:04:10] face responsibility. And then you must
[2:04:13] remember
[2:04:16] maybe you will build a nice home and
[2:04:18] then remember, you know, as as she as
[2:04:21] she married a woman, then you you you
[2:04:24] You got to think of the responsibility
[2:04:26] of raising children. So I mean every
[2:04:28] every form of life is is is a
[2:04:31] responsibility.
[2:04:33] But what we what we are looking at this
[2:04:35] morning is one of the highest
[2:04:37] responsibility.
[2:04:39] Amen.
[2:04:41] It's the father.
[2:04:44] If you if you uh uh uh you look in the
[2:04:48] word and in and uh uh Ephesian paral
[2:04:50] like Joshua or adoption message but
[2:04:53] Brandham taught us that was the thing
[2:04:55] that brought God from being alone. Why?
[2:04:59] Because he wanted to dwell with his
[2:05:01] attributes. He wanted to be a father.
[2:05:06] Amen.
[2:05:09] He wanted to be a father.
[2:05:17] That's what Jehovah signifies.
[2:05:21] The God that dwell with his offspring.
[2:05:26] And in dwelling with his offspring, he
[2:05:29] he has seven provision which is the
[2:05:32] seven redemptive names of Jehovah.
[2:05:36] And in that in those in those seven
[2:05:39] redemptive name, he meets all our needs.
[2:05:46] Being our father, being our parent,
[2:05:49] he's our healer.
[2:05:52] When we are sick, he comes out as
[2:05:54] Jehovah.
[2:05:56] Amen.
[2:06:03] Rafa
[2:06:07] when we are in distress he comes out as
[2:06:10] shalom
[2:06:11] are we together
[2:06:16] so we see this a it's a responsibility
[2:06:21] it's a responsibility
[2:06:24] this is not much in in the in the
[2:06:27] gentile culture in our culture but in
[2:06:31] the Jewish culture That's the reason why
[2:06:35] uh at at uh 12 years old
[2:06:38] the the the young Jewish boy is taken
[2:06:41] for mispah.
[2:06:45] Praise the Lord
[2:06:47] at 12 years old. Now he's he's now been
[2:06:51] taught responsibility.
[2:06:58] He set out to be taught, you know,
[2:07:01] responsibility. It's a ceremony. They
[2:07:04] brings him out. The father takes his
[2:07:06] think uh they have a Jewish name for it.
[2:07:09] He put it over his son.
[2:07:13] It's it's it's a it's a sense of of of
[2:07:15] of now showing him. In one sense, it is
[2:07:19] not because he has met everything the
[2:07:22] father has done. No, it's it's in the
[2:07:25] sense that he's telling the congregation
[2:07:29] these people are watching you now. You
[2:07:31] are my son. I brought you publicly now
[2:07:33] before these people to say you will be
[2:07:36] responsible to clean the yard. You will
[2:07:38] be responsible. You I mean you will your
[2:07:40] hands will be on deck.
[2:07:45] That's what the father is doing.
[2:07:48] He's now holding the board accountable
[2:07:51] in the public.
[2:07:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:59] What we do as Gentiles that we don't we
[2:08:02] don't hold them accountable. We we you
[2:08:04] know we we we uh in some sense we abuse
[2:08:08] them in the public.
[2:08:11] Amen. Because when we don't agree with
[2:08:14] them then we make sure all the neighbors
[2:08:15] know that this is a bad boy.
[2:08:22] But that's what it do.
[2:08:24] That's what it do. So from 12 years old,
[2:08:28] from 12 years to 19 years, he has to he
[2:08:33] has to find something that he can do.
[2:08:36] Either he's a he's a young man that with
[2:08:38] great cus or he's a carpenter. He got to
[2:08:41] find something. The father had to
[2:08:43] realize that this boy something there is
[2:08:46] something he as soon as he reached 20,
[2:08:48] he goes in the military. He save the
[2:08:52] house and then he go and serve the
[2:08:54] state.
[2:08:59] Responsibility.
[2:09:09] Responsibility.
[2:09:11] Why? Because one day he's going to be a
[2:09:14] leader.
[2:09:17] He's going to lead a home. He's going to
[2:09:19] lead a family.
[2:09:26] So he must be caught from a young age.
[2:09:28] He must be taught.
[2:09:34] Praise the Lord.
[2:09:42] But here is it. Many of us we were not
[2:09:45] caught at that age.
[2:09:47] Many of us that are fathers now, we were
[2:09:50] not caught at that age. We were not
[2:09:52] branded that way.
[2:09:55] It's hard for us to pass it down.
[2:09:59] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:05] Because what what our society do is that
[2:10:08] uh you know they send us to school. We
[2:10:11] go to school and and we go out of high
[2:10:13] school. We go to college and you know
[2:10:15] and and we choose a career and you know
[2:10:17] and and uh uh uh because because that
[2:10:20] that's the way the society appease to
[2:10:22] us.
[2:10:26] But how many well-educated people no
[2:10:29] sense of responsibility
[2:10:34] because it does not come by by by by
[2:10:36] degrees.
[2:10:40] It does not come by degrees.
[2:10:43] It comes by being taught ethics.
[2:10:47] Please. Thank you.
[2:10:56] Are we together?
[2:10:58] God our father,
[2:11:02] he's our beginner.
[2:11:05] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:07] Amen.
[2:11:10] He's our beginner.
[2:11:15] that
[2:11:18] that revelation is enough to to rock
[2:11:20] your boat.
[2:11:23] I don't know about you, but I've been
[2:11:25] there.
[2:11:26] Amen.
[2:11:29] I've been there.
[2:11:38] I've been there when I was uh uh I was
[2:11:42] maybe about six six years if I if I do
[2:11:46] remember very well about six or yeah
[2:11:49] about six or seven years old when I was
[2:11:52] taken to stay with my dad and that would
[2:11:55] be the time I would know my dad
[2:11:58] now. So what will happen to me in that
[2:12:02] place of being young to six years?
[2:12:06] I will I would just I would just assume
[2:12:11] I would assume that this was my father
[2:12:13] that this was my father. I would just
[2:12:15] assume
[2:12:18] and from a young age I can still
[2:12:19] remember it puts me to the place where I
[2:12:23] I I live in a world of assumption.
[2:12:29] I create my own fantasy in my mind
[2:12:34] that even even when I when I when I went
[2:12:37] to stay with my dad to go to school and
[2:12:40] and uh and and all of that I I had you
[2:12:43] know I I knew that I knew that's my dad.
[2:12:46] Mama told me that was my dad. You know
[2:12:48] the connection was there but still there
[2:12:51] has to be a growth
[2:12:54] a catchup.
[2:12:56] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:58] Amen.
[2:13:03] Because it's a different thing when a
[2:13:05] child is born and and and you hold them,
[2:13:09] they the they the they they fit into
[2:13:11] your warmness.
[2:13:13] The the connection grows from there.
[2:13:18] You might not get everything right, but
[2:13:22] something sticks. Something keeps you
[2:13:24] alone because the connection is there.
[2:13:28] They might not like this about you. You
[2:13:29] might not like that about it. But the
[2:13:31] connection is there. If the connection
[2:13:33] is not there,
[2:13:35] then you struggle.
[2:13:38] I will tell you
[2:13:41] the message of the hour
[2:13:45] brought a great deliverance to me.
[2:13:48] One of the first subject that came out
[2:13:51] of the word was the Godhead.
[2:13:54] Why? Because
[2:13:56] God knew I was longing to fill the void
[2:13:58] of a father.
[2:14:02] Dad took care of us. Sent us to, you
[2:14:04] know, good schools and uh and uh I mean
[2:14:07] good schools. I mean he was a civil
[2:14:09] servant. He took care of us and you know
[2:14:11] uh uh we drove roll car to school and
[2:14:14] all of that. Uh uh uh but you you just
[2:14:18] just I mean that their first five six
[2:14:22] years
[2:14:24] Medical science will tell you it's very
[2:14:26] important for the child.
[2:14:28] Connection bound with the parent.
[2:14:32] It's very very very very important. So
[2:14:35] I've I've been there. I've been there.
[2:14:37] I'm asking you to be just pray for me.
[2:14:39] Don't be sorry for me. I'm I'm a buffet
[2:14:41] now. Amen. Glory be to God. I'm a
[2:14:44] buffet. So don't don't sit down there
[2:14:45] and say, "Hey, I feel sorry for you.
[2:14:59] Hallelujah.
[2:15:00] I just I had to go that route to make it
[2:15:03] personal so you can connect with your
[2:15:05] experience.
[2:15:07] Okay? I want you to connect with your
[2:15:09] experience because I don't know you as I
[2:15:11] know mine. Okay? So I'm I'm just I'm
[2:15:14] just bringing it that way. And you see
[2:15:16] that's what also happen
[2:15:19] when you sit in a church that teach
[2:15:23] trinity.
[2:15:25] God the father, God the son, God the
[2:15:26] holy ghost.
[2:15:30] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:33] And that is the reason why I can I can
[2:15:36] say this because I can stand behind the
[2:15:39] word to back it. There are many in the
[2:15:41] message that are still preaching trinity
[2:15:43] doctrine.
[2:15:46] They think they believe one God because
[2:15:48] they baptize in the name of the Lord
[2:15:50] Jesus Christ. But the way they they
[2:15:53] understand the word is state trinity.
[2:16:03] You see, and that is the reason why that
[2:16:06] that has been one of the destructive
[2:16:08] doctrine that the that the that the the
[2:16:11] that the the the that the Roman brought
[2:16:14] into Christianity. It came from Rome
[2:16:18] with all their different gods.
[2:16:22] It's a killer doctrine.
[2:16:25] It break the very spine of the church.
[2:16:33] Because now you can't go directly to the
[2:16:35] father.
[2:16:37] You don't know the father.
[2:16:40] You got to go through the son.
[2:16:47] When it was just a manifestation of one
[2:16:50] God,
[2:16:54] one God just making himself known to his
[2:16:56] people.
[2:16:59] So you see all these things in our walk
[2:17:01] with God, it all goes back to our
[2:17:05] beginning
[2:17:07] on the understanding of who is our
[2:17:11] father.
[2:17:13] Who is our father? You have people that
[2:17:16] can trust the church than trusting God.
[2:17:21] They can trust the church. They have
[2:17:24] more relationship. They want to stop as
[2:17:26] their pastor. The pastor is elevated. I
[2:17:28] mean, he never does wrong. And they
[2:17:30] don't have no contact with God. Who's
[2:17:33] your father?
[2:17:46] And when things should happen and and
[2:17:48] and and things goes wrong, then the fit
[2:17:51] of the people are just wasted.
[2:17:55] Oh, I've been in that church. I I grew
[2:17:57] up in that church. I spent all of my
[2:17:59] life in that church. Oh, yeah. And and
[2:18:00] they get all of these excuse. Why?
[2:18:03] Because they were just as far as the
[2:18:06] church.
[2:18:10] The church was their origin. I was born
[2:18:12] in that church. I'm born in the message.
[2:18:15] The message is not your origin, people.
[2:18:17] God is your origin.
[2:18:22] Amen.
[2:18:29] God our father.
[2:18:35] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:40] You love the Lord. Let's give the Lord a
[2:18:42] hand of praise.
[2:18:45] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:18:49] [Applause]
[2:19:02] Brother Eric had to do something for me.
[2:19:04] Last night he came over to the house and
[2:19:06] uh you know I I love to watch this
[2:19:08] documentary
[2:19:10] of people being reconnected to their
[2:19:13] father. So I was sitting eating and I
[2:19:15] was watching some on YouTube. you know
[2:19:18] after 40 years meeting their father I
[2:19:21] love to watch it
[2:19:23] uh because because of you you just you
[2:19:27] you see the current
[2:19:30] you see the current
[2:19:33] you see the current
[2:19:37] so internal life is living for others
[2:19:43] it's living for others
[2:19:45] and uh
[2:19:47] uh Uh
[2:19:53] don't let us not think that uh we can we
[2:19:57] can jump over the people that God placed
[2:20:00] in our life and then God will be
[2:20:01] satisfied with our sacrifice. No, he
[2:20:04] will not. The people that around us, you
[2:20:07] know, the people he has given to us, the
[2:20:09] children, the wives, the husband, you
[2:20:11] know, let's let's uh may God help us to
[2:20:15] appreciate him. Amen. the parents, you
[2:20:19] know, uh uh I mean no matter no matter
[2:20:22] how how bad you know the parent was, you
[2:20:26] must appreciate them. You know, the
[2:20:28] reason there is that you will never
[2:20:31] understand what state of mind they were
[2:20:33] in
[2:20:38] when certain thing happened, what they
[2:20:40] were dealing with.
[2:20:44] Now you think you're in the message. You
[2:20:46] know the word.
[2:20:49] I know motherhood, womanhood. Brother B
[2:20:52] says three sacrif.
[2:21:13] So I just I want to connect you back to
[2:21:14] your roots. Amen. I want to connect you
[2:21:17] back to your roots.
[2:21:19] And uh
[2:21:29] as I always like to throw something in
[2:21:31] and make you to think, I having one
[2:21:33] quote here I want to throw in and also
[2:21:35] make you to think. Look away to Jesus.
[2:21:38] I was I was looking at uh uh
[2:21:43] uh living for others, you know, serving
[2:21:46] one another and and all of that. And I
[2:21:49] thought about this and I went to look
[2:21:51] for it. And the reason why I want to
[2:21:54] bring this up to you church is that uh
[2:21:58] uh these are some of the oneliners.
[2:22:02] You know, oneliners, you know what
[2:22:03] oneliner is? One liner is when a person
[2:22:06] just take one quote and make a doctrine
[2:22:10] or they take one scripture and make a
[2:22:13] doctrine and don't even have the context
[2:22:16] of what it was saying. So these are some
[2:22:18] of the oneliners that runs in our rank.
[2:22:22] So let's deal with it this morning.
[2:22:25] Look away to Jesus.
[2:22:27] I said Lord, she didn't mean what she
[2:22:31] did this morning. She didn't mean that.
[2:22:33] I said, "Lord, not one time has she ever
[2:22:37] said one word about me going in the
[2:22:40] meetings, staying moms or whatever it
[2:22:45] was." Now, if you know the background of
[2:22:47] this was when brother Brandon wife had a
[2:22:50] tumor
[2:22:51] and he was praying for her. So, that's
[2:22:54] what he's dealing with here. So, trying
[2:22:56] to give you some context now.
[2:23:00] And uh uh uh not one time has she ever
[2:23:04] opened her mouth about it. She has
[2:23:08] always
[2:23:10] send my clothes to the cleaner and wash
[2:23:12] my shirts and had
[2:23:17] everything ready to go in the meeting.
[2:23:20] Then she wonder how
[2:23:26] she can serve God.
[2:23:28] Praise the Lord. If you ever read about
[2:23:31] uh uh sister media, she was someone very
[2:23:34] timid. She did she there deal with lot
[2:23:36] of complex.
[2:23:38] I don't know how you sisters who have
[2:23:40] there will feel the same to have a man
[2:23:44] with that level caliber of ministry and
[2:23:48] uh uh uh you know and and he's always
[2:23:51] there in the public eyes and all the
[2:23:53] things that he's doing you know uh uh
[2:23:57] that many times she didn't go to the
[2:23:59] meeting because she never felt that uh
[2:24:02] you know she was adequate to be among
[2:24:04] the minister's wife.
[2:24:07] Many times she didn't go. Brother
[2:24:08] Brandham tried would have loved to have
[2:24:11] her dead, but many times she didn't go.
[2:24:15] Now with this situation now, Brother
[2:24:17] Branam is now now uh after after the
[2:24:21] Lord healed her, you know, on on the
[2:24:23] surgical table, the the the tumor left
[2:24:26] her when when the prophet prayed for
[2:24:28] her, he's now saying this thing as a
[2:24:32] testimony
[2:24:34] and saying when she do all of these
[2:24:36] things and yet she's wondering in
[2:24:39] herself, how can she serve God?
[2:24:44] Because here is a husband you have every
[2:24:48] morning you wake up he's telling you one
[2:24:50] vision.
[2:24:54] Praise the Lord. Meet them.
[2:24:58] I saw the vision. Yeah. Three men going
[2:25:00] to come here this morning around 9:45.
[2:25:04] One will be
[2:25:08] Are you Are you seeing what I'm saying?
[2:25:11] And then maybe she's just like me that
[2:25:13] can't have a straight dream,
[2:25:21] you know, away from it, it can look like
[2:25:25] it's wonderful, but living with it,
[2:25:29] it can it has a way of being
[2:25:31] intimidating.
[2:25:33] We are humans.
[2:25:35] Okay, I'm trying to put your flesh on
[2:25:38] you now. You've been too much in the
[2:25:39] spirit.
[2:25:42] We are humans. It has a way of being
[2:25:45] intimidated. Now the person has to grow
[2:25:50] to the understanding of knowing their
[2:25:52] place.
[2:25:56] her daughter wrote a piece on her
[2:26:01] and uh and and and and uh when Rebecca
[2:26:04] wrote it, Rebecca said her mother love
[2:26:10] washing and ironing. She love ironing.
[2:26:13] She will always find clothes to iron.
[2:26:18] When any of them doing their she would
[2:26:19] take it in iron. She said one day she
[2:26:21] went and talked to her to her mom. What
[2:26:23] make you to fall in love with this? and
[2:26:25] her mom told her, "I really don't like
[2:26:27] it."
[2:26:33] So, she was not doing it because it's
[2:26:36] something that she loved. She was doing
[2:26:38] it because she wanted to be engaged.
[2:26:43] She felt that it helped her to settle
[2:26:45] down.
[2:26:49] Are are you seeing what what I'm saying?
[2:26:52] So it it has her now. So he's saying
[2:26:54] this. She's been nice to me. She get my
[2:26:57] clothes set. I go for months and months
[2:26:59] and months. She's there. She take care
[2:27:00] of the children. She take it. Then she's
[2:27:02] always asking me how can I serve God?
[2:27:07] Are you seeing it? Okay. So on the basis
[2:27:11] of this he's going to make this
[2:27:13] statement.
[2:27:17] You women as you serve your husband
[2:27:21] you serve God of course.
[2:27:24] Now so you see how that one liner
[2:27:29] is easier to be a doctrine and many has
[2:27:32] made it a doctrine.
[2:27:35] Are we together?
[2:27:39] Amen. Is it truth? Yes, it's truth.
[2:27:45] Does that erase the fact that husband if
[2:27:48] you serve your wife you are serving God?
[2:27:51] Is it in this quote? It's there.
[2:27:57] It's there because if you love your
[2:27:59] wife, you must serve her.
[2:28:03] If we must serve one another.
[2:28:06] So you see that and that is the that is
[2:28:08] the way we become religious and we get
[2:28:11] away from the reality and think that it
[2:28:14] only belong to the woman and don't
[2:28:15] belong to the man.
[2:28:19] Are you seeing what I'm saying? I'm not
[2:28:21] trying to fight against the word but I'm
[2:28:25] trying to take us a little bit farther
[2:28:30] that we must not just stop to this line.
[2:28:31] We must go farther because if if
[2:28:34] internal life is living for others, let
[2:28:37] us not live for them that are outside.
[2:28:39] Let's start from home and start living
[2:28:42] outside. That's what I'm trying to say.
[2:28:44] Let's start from home.
[2:28:48] Let live for the children. Let live for
[2:28:51] the wives. Then maybe we can go to the
[2:28:53] next door neighbor. Then we can get to
[2:28:55] the gas station and then to the shopping
[2:28:58] center.
[2:29:00] Push a card for somebody. give somebody
[2:29:02] the card, help them and and all of that.
[2:29:04] That's what I'm saying. That's where I
[2:29:06] want to go this morning.
[2:29:12] You know, Peter is the one that took
[2:29:16] their experience from Genesis 18.
[2:29:21] He says, "As even Abraham called, Sarah
[2:29:24] called her husband Lord."
[2:29:26] Do you read Genesis 18?
[2:29:30] When you read Genesis 18,
[2:29:33] did Sarah call her husband Lord?
[2:29:37] Are we together?
[2:29:39] Did Sarah call her husband Lord? You
[2:29:42] sure?
[2:29:43] You sure you read it?
[2:29:49] Are you sure you read it? Okay, let's
[2:29:52] read it.
[2:29:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:29:59] Genesis 18.
[2:30:06] If you find the verse, you let me know.
[2:30:28] Genesis 18 vers 112.
[2:30:31] Are we together?
[2:30:34] Amen.
[2:30:44] 11. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[2:30:47] were striking in age and it ceased to be
[2:30:50] with Sarah after the man or the woman.
[2:30:53] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself.
[2:30:58] She never said it within herself.
[2:31:08] Peter is the one that told us that Sarah
[2:31:11] called Abraham Lord. But here is what it
[2:31:14] is.
[2:31:18] If she could think that much of her
[2:31:22] husband,
[2:31:23] it's not difficult for her to say it.
[2:31:30] Do you see where the Apostle Peter is
[2:31:32] coming from?
[2:31:34] If she could think that much of her
[2:31:36] husband,
[2:31:38] not on a pressure,
[2:31:43] not him telling her say Sarah call her
[2:31:45] husband Lord, call me Lord. No.
[2:31:50] because of his kindness, because of the
[2:31:54] way he treats her. If she could think
[2:31:57] that much of him when he's not around
[2:32:03] when she's back in the tent just hearing
[2:32:06] them talking
[2:32:12] she laugh within herself saying after
[2:32:16] I'm wax and old shall I have pleasure my
[2:32:20] law being old.
[2:32:24] So this is what Peter was referring to.
[2:32:29] You see, and that's what brother Brandon
[2:32:31] would tell us in the message uh uh uh uh
[2:32:34] uh thinking man's filter.
[2:32:38] That's why he said in the message
[2:32:40] thinking man Fitter,
[2:32:43] he says the way we we the way we deal
[2:32:46] with our spouse, the way we deal with
[2:32:48] our wife, he says nobody know you better
[2:32:50] than your wife.
[2:32:53] He says the word reverence how a woman
[2:32:56] should reverence her husband like Paul
[2:32:57] said he said it's it's an equiventing
[2:33:00] word that is used to reverencing God. So
[2:33:04] it goes back to this very same thing.
[2:33:07] But you see what brings that out
[2:33:10] is the way the man live.
[2:33:13] It all goes back to the fatherhood.
[2:33:23] in so much that she can think that of
[2:33:27] him.
[2:33:34] Words are what?
[2:33:36] What are words?
[2:33:39] Words are thought expressed.
[2:33:42] So Peter was only expressing what was in
[2:33:46] Sarah's mind.
[2:33:48] Are we together? Fatherhood.
[2:33:51] God our father.
[2:33:54] It is our responsibility brothers.
[2:33:58] It's a very serious responsibility.
[2:34:02] It's a very serious responsibility. Our
[2:34:05] responsibility to the word, our prayer
[2:34:08] life, the way we conduct ourself, our
[2:34:12] position in church.
[2:34:18] our position in church.
[2:34:25] We must assume oursel to that
[2:34:26] responsibility. This is what I'm
[2:34:28] bringing my family.
[2:34:33] If I call this place church, if I call
[2:34:35] this place home and I think it's good
[2:34:38] for me and my family, I must get
[2:34:40] involved. You know what denomination do
[2:34:44] that? We don't do around the message and
[2:34:47] I don't do
[2:34:50] they target men of reputation, men of
[2:34:53] money and give them position to keep
[2:34:56] them in church. The scripture says look
[2:35:00] among you. If you are not in church, how
[2:35:03] will they find you?
[2:35:07] The Bible says look among you and choose
[2:35:10] men filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:35:14] If you are not there, how will they find
[2:35:16] you?
[2:35:22] It's a serious responsibility.
[2:35:26] It's not a It's not a oneman show.
[2:35:31] It's not a woman show. It's because of
[2:35:34] the sacronis that we put to the word of
[2:35:37] God and the things of God. It's easy for
[2:35:39] me to say, "Hey, you go Kly."
[2:35:42] Just join. What? He know what he's
[2:35:44] doing. He don't know what he's doing.
[2:35:45] That make the service go
[2:35:48] and the whole thing just turn to a te.
[2:35:57] Is that a woman show?
[2:36:04] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:11] It's a God-given responsibility and we
[2:36:13] must hold it to that standard.
[2:36:15] We must hold it to that standard.
[2:36:22] That's what we believe.
[2:36:26] But you see it's a responsibility
[2:36:33] in our place as h as as as men as
[2:36:36] fathers we supposed to be leaders.
[2:36:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:55] So it comes it comes from a life of
[2:36:57] dedication.
[2:37:01] It comes from a life of commitment.
[2:37:05] Sometimes people sit back. They say,
[2:37:07] "Oh, well, you know, he he like to do
[2:37:08] everything." No, I don't like it because
[2:37:11] you don't know how my body feels. You
[2:37:13] really think I like it?
[2:37:17] It's not funny. It's serious.
[2:37:30] But it's how much is the way we take the
[2:37:32] the way we take the things of God, the
[2:37:34] way we relate to it.
[2:37:38] Know when brother said for 17 years
[2:37:42] I did everything. That's why he said 17
[2:37:45] years
[2:37:46] in his little tabernacle. You think he
[2:37:49] wanted to do everything
[2:37:55] but but the things of God you just you
[2:37:57] don't you don't you just don't handle it
[2:38:00] irresponsibly.
[2:38:02] You will damage your life. You will
[2:38:05] damage the life of the people
[2:38:08] because pretty soon it turns to a
[2:38:09] theater and then just bunch of laughter
[2:38:13] then just carrying and goring
[2:38:17] and nothing of God is in it at all and I
[2:38:21] can we can come here and just read 50
[2:38:23] coat of brother Brandham to you. Brother
[2:38:24] Brandon say brother Brandon say brother
[2:38:26] let's pray let's go home
[2:38:29] having a form of godliness.
[2:38:38] So we have a responsibility.
[2:38:42] We have a responsibility
[2:38:44] and I pray that God show you yours.
[2:38:49] I pray that God raise you up to yours.
[2:38:52] Don't tell me your responsibility is
[2:38:54] only to come and sit down.
[2:38:59] No,
[2:39:00] because in the Old Testament tabernacle
[2:39:02] there was no seat. That New Testament
[2:39:05] church Saturdays
[2:39:10] it actually came from the Roman church
[2:39:12] when all the uh Constantine and all the
[2:39:15] big guys started coming. They were
[2:39:17] meeting on the mountains on the lake and
[2:39:19] uh when Jesus was preaching on the boat
[2:39:20] what kind of seat they had to sit on
[2:39:23] when he fed 5,000 what where what seat
[2:39:26] they sat on?
[2:39:32] It's father day. So I I'm I'm just
[2:39:34] talking to challenge you. I'm not mad
[2:39:37] with you. Praise the Lord. If I'm mad
[2:39:40] with you, I meet you out there.
[2:39:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:39:47] You know that as your friend blood you
[2:39:50] meet me on the beach.
[2:39:53] Praise the Lord. We grew up like that.
[2:39:55] So,
[2:40:03] you love the Lord. It's Father's Day.
[2:40:07] So, we must challenge oursel today. You
[2:40:09] know when you talk about the beginner
[2:40:13] if any child comes to the place and
[2:40:15] really understand that
[2:40:18] they are going to struggle.
[2:40:20] If their parents go into uh uh uh
[2:40:23] same-sex marriage with two women who's
[2:40:26] the beginner
[2:40:30] child arises you see. So because of the
[2:40:33] failure
[2:40:35] of fatherhood,
[2:40:37] it has just created confusion
[2:40:42] because all all father is defined as the
[2:40:44] one that can have child.
[2:40:51] Are we together?
[2:40:53] The same way with mother.
[2:40:58] That's the way they take it.
[2:41:04] It's just a title. No.
[2:41:07] For you and a son of God and a daughter
[2:41:10] of God, it's not a title. It's a
[2:41:11] character.
[2:41:15] Your fatherhood is a character
[2:41:21] that you can display it. When you see a
[2:41:24] lost boy,
[2:41:28] when you see a boy that is wandering, it
[2:41:30] comes out because it's a character.
[2:41:33] If it's just a title that is written on
[2:41:35] your forehead, you pass. But if it's
[2:41:38] something that is in you, it makes you
[2:41:39] concerned
[2:41:45] because it's a character.
[2:41:54] God our father.
[2:41:59] Musicians, you can come.
[2:42:02] Some people have wonderful father day
[2:42:04] dinner waiting for them. Let me not
[2:42:07] spoil the meal and make it get cold.
[2:42:15] Let's bow our heads together.
[2:42:21] We read that as u
[2:42:23] as u scripture in the beginning
[2:42:27] of our
[2:42:30] for our scripture reading but with our
[2:42:31] heads back let's pray the Lord's prayer
[2:42:34] together
[2:42:37] our father
[2:42:38] who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[2:42:42] thy kingdom come thy will be done as it
[2:42:46] is in heaven
[2:42:48] Give us this day our daily bread. And
[2:42:51] forgive uses
[2:42:53] as we forgive those who trespass against
[2:42:56] us.
[2:43:01] is the kingdom
[2:43:03] and glory forever and ever.
[2:43:23] Is that the only song you are playing?
[2:43:25] How far? Let's try that. I don't know if
[2:43:28] we have the worst Our
[2:43:35] [Music]
[2:43:38] father,
[2:43:42] you are in heaven,
[2:43:46] abolition.
