[1:07:03] chapter 53 but uh
[1:07:06] you can we can all read it when we when
[1:07:09] we get home let's just read Matthew
[1:07:11] chapter 27 just want to go into uh just
[1:07:15] a little thought that I had on my on my
[1:07:17] on my heart
[1:07:19] tonight and before we can go into
[1:07:22] praying Matthew
[1:07:25] chapter 27
[1:07:29] many years
[1:07:30] years back
[1:07:36] whenever I will
[1:07:38] I would choose to
[1:07:39] to spend some time with the Lord that
[1:07:42] will want to just find a place
[1:07:45] praying or maybe go away that for a
[1:07:48] couple of days in facts and praying I
[1:07:51] will always tell the brothers I'm going
[1:07:53] to Pilot judgment Hall
[1:07:55] so tonight I want to speak a little bit
[1:07:57] on pilot judgment Hall
[1:08:01] Matthew chapter 27 let's just read verse
[1:08:04] 1 and 2.
[1:08:11] when the morning was come
[1:08:14] all the chief priests and the others or
[1:08:16] the people took counsel against Jesus
[1:08:20] to put him to death
[1:08:23] now chapter 26 will let us to know that
[1:08:25] he spent the whole night
[1:08:29] Jesus spent the whole night before the
[1:08:32] council
[1:08:34] praise the Lord
[1:08:36] he spent the whole night before the
[1:08:39] council this was the religious Council
[1:08:43] and there was the night where the Bible
[1:08:47] says all the disciples
[1:08:50] denied him
[1:08:52] they left him alone
[1:08:54] so the picture that I want us to create
[1:08:56] in our mind tonight
[1:08:58] Jesus was forsaken right in the church
[1:09:05] the first night of judgment was with the
[1:09:08] Council of the others
[1:09:12] the sahitrans council
[1:09:15] the herodians all of those people that
[1:09:17] have different forms of belief United
[1:09:19] together
[1:09:22] to crucify him
[1:09:24] so the Bible says when the morning was
[1:09:26] come all the chief priests and the
[1:09:29] others of the people
[1:09:32] took counsel together
[1:09:36] took counsel against Jesus
[1:09:39] to put him to death
[1:09:41] and when they abound him
[1:09:44] they led him away
[1:09:46] and deliver him to Pontius polish the
[1:09:50] governor
[1:09:51] verse 11.
[1:09:55] and Jesus stood before the governor
[1:09:59] and the governor asked him saying Adele
[1:10:03] the king of the Jews
[1:10:06] and Jesus said unto him
[1:10:08] thou
[1:10:10] safe
[1:10:14] praise the Lord
[1:10:18] and when all and when
[1:10:20] he was accused of the chief priests in
[1:10:23] the others
[1:10:25] he answered nothing
[1:10:28] then say a pilot unto him eurodel net
[1:10:32] how many things the witness against they
[1:10:35] and and he answered him
[1:10:42] to never a word in so much they are the
[1:10:45] governor Marvel greatly
[1:10:48] praise the Lord
[1:10:51] the Lord bless you you may have your
[1:10:52] seed I read a quote here from Brother
[1:10:54] Branham
[1:11:02] what will we do with Jesus
[1:11:06] called the Christ
[1:11:12] praise the Lord
[1:11:17] you think about it now
[1:11:23] he was first brought before the council
[1:11:26] that is the religious people those are
[1:11:28] the people that will represent the
[1:11:30] church
[1:11:35] and they spend the whole night
[1:11:40] when right in the Amaze they have
[1:11:42] Lazarus that was Raising from the dead
[1:11:49] they had another era Jairus
[1:11:51] whose daughter was also raising from the
[1:11:54] dead
[1:11:56] praise the Lord
[1:12:00] the heart of blind man Blind by Timbers
[1:12:02] that have just received his sight
[1:12:06] when he cried out son of David have
[1:12:09] mercy for me
[1:12:13] and how all of these things but even
[1:12:15] this Council
[1:12:17] they testify that for none of these good
[1:12:20] works
[1:12:24] we are crucified him
[1:12:27] but him being the man called himself God
[1:12:33] praise the Lord
[1:12:35] when right in their own hands they were
[1:12:37] holding the Torah
[1:12:40] yes
[1:12:42] they were holding the Torah where Moses
[1:12:44] said the Lord your God will raise up a
[1:12:47] prophet
[1:12:48] like unto me
[1:12:52] and David said this that the word of the
[1:12:54] Lord come unto
[1:12:56] the prophet called them gods
[1:13:02] amen praise the Lord
[1:13:05] before he will be taken to pilate to be
[1:13:08] judged
[1:13:09] before he would get to Pilot Hall
[1:13:13] to be Jewish because the same year is
[1:13:16] there
[1:13:17] before the council
[1:13:21] you will see one lady told period are
[1:13:23] you now one of them now the the people
[1:13:26] who come
[1:13:27] but before pilot judgment Hall it was
[1:13:30] only the elders and the chief
[1:13:33] the people were left out
[1:13:37] now John says in his gospel
[1:13:42] if there was a recording of everything
[1:13:44] that Jesus did we would not have a book
[1:13:48] many of those people that came over told
[1:13:51] the the is is the front the front porch
[1:13:55] of the the synagoguese where Jesus was
[1:13:58] judged
[1:14:01] many of those people that came and spent
[1:14:04] all of that night up looking at our Lord
[1:14:08] being ridiculed
[1:14:09] some of them were healed in his meetings
[1:14:15] praise the Lord
[1:14:19] some of them were healed Jesus really
[1:14:23] never needed to lay his hands on the
[1:14:25] sink for the sake to be healed
[1:14:28] if if the shadow of Peter
[1:14:31] could heal the sake in the book of Acts
[1:14:35] you think about it how many
[1:14:37] neighborhoods that Jesus passed and a
[1:14:40] sick person lying in the bed
[1:14:42] receive their healing
[1:14:47] praise the Lord
[1:14:49] if in our day the angel of the Lord can
[1:14:53] visit the neighborhood and heal those
[1:14:54] two women
[1:14:56] how much more in a day when our Lord
[1:14:58] himself was upon the Earth
[1:15:02] many of them benefited from his ministry
[1:15:08] but yet that evening
[1:15:10] before their Council
[1:15:16] they could not say a word
[1:15:21] praise the Lord
[1:15:28] brother Branham taught a story
[1:15:32] and we spoke about his year when we were
[1:15:34] talking about uh Mary Magdalene
[1:15:36] vertebraham told a story then and uh uh
[1:15:40] uh and you you can find that in uh
[1:15:44] the prince of the House of David
[1:15:48] where he says uh it was only
[1:15:51] that woman
[1:15:55] that Jesus cast out seven demons out of
[1:15:59] her Bert says she was the only one that
[1:16:02] said what have he done only heal your
[1:16:06] sake yeah
[1:16:08] praise the Lord
[1:16:10] and the prophet of God said to shut her
[1:16:12] out of the heart
[1:16:14] even the ones that stole before him even
[1:16:16] the ones that said we will give our life
[1:16:21] they were all right in the council that
[1:16:23] evening
[1:16:31] praise the Lord
[1:16:34] you see they give us a picture tonight
[1:16:40] that I mean you can be radical and run
[1:16:43] into uh into the street and challenge
[1:16:46] your people
[1:16:48] to force them to to uh to receive the
[1:16:50] Lord and you could be stoned and and I
[1:16:53] mean you could be killed and many people
[1:16:56] try to do there to to equate themselves
[1:16:59] or amount themselves onto the
[1:17:01] persecution of Stephen
[1:17:06] oh it takes some kind of a glory for
[1:17:08] being persecuted for the word
[1:17:10] but as we were just read tonight brother
[1:17:13] Brandon will say if you were there that
[1:17:15] night
[1:17:19] if you were there that night
[1:17:26] he led us to know that our actions today
[1:17:30] tells us
[1:17:32] praise the Lord
[1:17:35] if we are
[1:17:36] so shy to testify of him if we were
[1:17:40] there that night you won't say a word
[1:17:47] even the man that were eyewitnesses
[1:17:55] praise the Lord
[1:17:56] they asked too bad
[1:17:59] and they were hoping that he will be
[1:18:02] able to throw some kind of for Magic
[1:18:07] or he would just do something
[1:18:09] Supernatural
[1:18:10] they were they were just hoping
[1:18:13] but it could never come to the defense
[1:18:15] of the word
[1:18:21] praise the Lord
[1:18:29] that was the council that was the church
[1:18:32] those were the religious people yes
[1:18:39] they all agree with the council
[1:18:47] now when brother Baron preached this
[1:18:49] message what would I do with Jesus
[1:18:51] called the Christ
[1:18:53] he says honor the inspiration of this
[1:18:56] message that's where he got his
[1:18:58] indictment from
[1:18:59] he says I will enact this generation
[1:19:03] of crucifying Jesus
[1:19:06] because both the church and the state
[1:19:10] did unite to crucify the world
[1:19:15] and now the church and the state
[1:19:18] allowing all the gay rights and allowing
[1:19:21] every abominable faith
[1:19:24] I will tell you that it used to be
[1:19:28] that when we come to a weekend like Good
[1:19:31] Friday weekend you could feel it
[1:19:36] but if you don't look on your calendar
[1:19:37] this weekend can pass by and you never
[1:19:41] even know
[1:19:42] yes that is a good Friday weekend
[1:19:45] on a good Friday weekend they will close
[1:19:47] schools
[1:19:50] because it was a good Friday weekend
[1:20:07] says CLS let me read yeah
[1:20:10] so we can get to praying he says now
[1:20:13] I believe that the hour
[1:20:16] where I was saying starts
[1:20:19] it's a long about daylight
[1:20:22] in Pilot judgment Hall
[1:20:27] and
[1:20:28] it's one of the saddest time
[1:20:33] praise the Lord
[1:20:36] one of the saddest time
[1:20:42] and one of the most crucial time of all
[1:20:46] history
[1:20:50] praise the Lord
[1:20:53] I was thinking about this the Book of
[1:20:55] Joshua recall that when Joshua told the
[1:20:58] song to stand still the Bible says there
[1:21:01] were never a day
[1:21:04] like that day
[1:21:07] praise the Lord
[1:21:09] but I would say that this day
[1:21:13] amen was even greater than the day when
[1:21:17] Joshua stood this through the song to
[1:21:19] stand still
[1:21:23] because this day the son refused to give
[1:21:26] its light
[1:21:29] even Joshua could not turn it tell it to
[1:21:32] stand still
[1:21:34] because the Creator
[1:21:36] was hanging between the Heaven and the
[1:21:38] Earth
[1:21:43] one of the most crucial time of all
[1:21:46] history it was the saddest mistake
[1:21:50] the church ever made in his history
[1:21:55] they had just made it and now is being
[1:21:58] thrown into the lap of the governor the
[1:22:03] state both church and state because they
[1:22:07] were a people choosing of God
[1:22:10] he called to be his seventh
[1:22:13] and the nation was supposed to be
[1:22:18] control
[1:22:20] by God's Lord
[1:22:24] that does that just now look like what
[1:22:27] America was supposed to be
[1:22:29] control
[1:22:31] by God's Lord
[1:22:36] praise the Lord
[1:22:38] so what I want us to do tonight before
[1:22:40] we pray
[1:22:42] even though if we were there they
[1:22:44] wouldn't have allowed us to come in
[1:22:47] we were all going to just stop
[1:22:50] at the temple sign we could go on the
[1:22:54] temple porch
[1:22:56] and
[1:22:59] washed away
[1:23:03] they were disgrace in our Lord
[1:23:07] praise the Lord
[1:23:10] what a sight
[1:23:14] that they had that night
[1:23:17] to hide the god of Heaven and Earth in
[1:23:19] their hands
[1:23:23] praise the Lord
[1:23:27] what I want for us to take a kind of an
[1:23:29] imaginary trait
[1:23:31] tonight
[1:23:34] to imagine
[1:23:36] what was it like being
[1:23:43] on pilot judgment Hall
[1:23:47] the Bible says even pilate Marvel
[1:23:52] that everything they were saying about
[1:23:54] the Lord Jesus
[1:23:56] he opened not his mouth
[1:24:01] praise the Lord amen that's the greatest
[1:24:05] miracle
[1:24:08] that a man will be falsely accused
[1:24:13] can you open not his mouth
[1:24:19] oh may God help us
[1:24:22] praise the Lord
[1:24:24] may God help us
[1:24:26] sometimes
[1:24:28] they are just times where
[1:24:31] you cannot defend yourself
[1:24:33] no matter what you say
[1:24:36] praise the Lord
[1:24:37] amen no matter what you say they still
[1:24:41] will not believe
[1:24:44] then let God come to your defense
[1:24:51] but let's take it imagine every trip
[1:24:54] tonight
[1:25:03] but I'm sharing in another series of the
[1:25:06] same message he says we stand
[1:25:08] in a similar tribe this morning
[1:25:12] the word over a Triad all denomination
[1:25:15] has turned down the word
[1:25:18] I know they sound very harsh and I want
[1:25:22] the ministers who are listening
[1:25:24] yeah present and those on tape also
[1:25:29] to try to understand
[1:25:31] this now
[1:25:34] praise the Lord
[1:25:35] you see even with the religious word
[1:25:40] it's easy to keep a historical Jesus on
[1:25:45] our mind
[1:25:47] and yet reject the word yeah
[1:25:53] praise the Lord
[1:25:55] as the religious word
[1:25:57] it's all all celebrating Good Friday
[1:26:01] Palm Sunday
[1:26:03] Easter all that is on your mind is a
[1:26:07] historical 2 000 years ago Jesus
[1:26:11] that's what they are having on your mind
[1:26:13] but the word may flesh right before us
[1:26:15] the word the present their word
[1:26:23] they are crucifying that word
[1:26:28] praise the Lord
[1:26:34] and that's word
[1:26:37] our challenge
[1:26:39] is tonight as bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:43] as people that have received the message
[1:26:46] of the hour
[1:26:49] amen
[1:26:52] we can stand for the message
[1:26:56] and create a picture in our mind
[1:27:01] and love the prophet
[1:27:06] but we have to line up with what he says
[1:27:09] remember brother Branham said and I said
[1:27:12] over the bride's Revival
[1:27:14] is to stay in line with the word
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:20] that's the bride's Revival
[1:27:26] if now we will take the very quotes of
[1:27:28] the message
[1:27:31] crucified
[1:27:32] the Lord are French
[1:27:35] give ourselves reasons why we must do
[1:27:37] things
[1:27:39] praise the Lord
[1:27:42] just like some are giving himself reason
[1:27:45] why they think brother Branham is wrong
[1:27:48] but let's go ahead tonight
[1:27:53] but I'm holding my point and making my
[1:27:55] point here and saying that we are
[1:27:59] standing tonight
[1:28:00] in another pilot
[1:28:03] Joshua Hall
[1:28:10] you say if I did house two there
[1:28:16] I've been have spoke out for Jesus
[1:28:20] and well what are you doing about it now
[1:28:24] that's the thing see
[1:28:26] no matter how much the church had turned
[1:28:29] him down
[1:28:31] I didn't have stool by his side
[1:28:36] you have got the opportunity
[1:28:40] they turned him down
[1:28:43] praise the Lord
[1:28:45] it's so easy to live in an imaginary
[1:28:50] world
[1:28:54] it's just so easy well if it was me
[1:28:57] well if I was there
[1:29:01] for right now
[1:29:03] right here tonight
[1:29:07] praise the Lord
[1:29:12] the biggest issue
[1:29:14] on pilot judgment Hall is their brother
[1:29:17] Branham said pilate knew that he had
[1:29:20] Jesus on his hands
[1:29:27] if we were some of the entire judgment
[1:29:31] he knew that he had Jesus on his hands
[1:29:37] spoke a little bit about that on Sunday
[1:29:46] he was a very young governor
[1:29:49] was a young man
[1:29:53] and he was sent to to Judea
[1:29:57] to acquire the uprising
[1:30:00] because all of this firm of Jesus has
[1:30:04] gone to Rome
[1:30:07] you have to remember at his birth
[1:30:10] the wise man came and said
[1:30:13] where is he born King of the Jews
[1:30:18] so Rome actually sent him
[1:30:22] for him to put a stop
[1:30:25] for him to make sure that he quieted all
[1:30:29] the uprising that was happening
[1:30:34] praise the Lord
[1:30:36] because Jesus when he feel the thousands
[1:30:44] by just a few loaves of bread and fish
[1:30:48] the Bible says five thousands are one
[1:30:50] time
[1:30:54] everyone that were there that ahead of
[1:30:56] the food went testifying I saw it there
[1:30:59] was no food
[1:31:01] and all of these things was creating a
[1:31:04] concern to Rome
[1:31:06] so now pilate have Jesus on his hands
[1:31:13] praise the Lord
[1:31:16] the council is trying to get rid of
[1:31:19] Jesus off of their hands
[1:31:25] and they are placing it on pilot hands
[1:31:28] praise the Lord
[1:31:31] and pilate is now looking for
[1:31:34] who hangs also
[1:31:38] that he's going to pass it
[1:31:40] praise the Lord
[1:31:45] and if you just read
[1:31:48] the entire chapter
[1:31:51] you'll see that that
[1:31:53] Jesus was throwing no no sense of
[1:31:57] looking for Pilots sympathy
[1:32:00] doing
[1:32:02] praise the Lord
[1:32:04] he said you have no Authority but what
[1:32:06] my father has given you
[1:32:11] he said for this hours I was born that's
[1:32:14] the reason why I came into the world
[1:32:25] praise the Lord
[1:32:27] now with the the religious word
[1:32:30] rejecting him
[1:32:34] the political word rejecting him
[1:32:40] my question tonight before we go into
[1:32:42] prayer
[1:32:44] what are we doing
[1:32:50] with this Jesus
[1:32:57] what are we doing
[1:33:00] Good Shepherd Fellowship
[1:33:02] with this Jesus
[1:33:10] praise the Lord
[1:33:13] what are we doing with this Jesus
[1:33:16] that is revealed to us
[1:33:19] through a Ministry
[1:33:27] that God will give us the privilege
[1:33:36] and bring us in contact and open our
[1:33:39] understanding and give you the grace
[1:33:43] praise the Lord
[1:33:45] what are you really believing or you are
[1:33:47] faking it but you know that
[1:33:51] the one thing about this message
[1:33:54] praise the lord it's not a message of a
[1:33:57] man's idea it's a message that was given
[1:34:00] to God's Prophet brother Brandon
[1:34:04] yes sir
[1:34:06] praise the Lord
[1:34:07] what are we doing
[1:34:10] with this Jesus
[1:34:12] that we call the message
[1:34:18] praise the Lord why do we call the
[1:34:21] master brother Brian said what is the
[1:34:22] seal he said it's Christ
[1:34:26] what is the message it's not the dress
[1:34:29] code
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:31] it's not the name of the church
[1:34:33] is Christ
[1:34:40] what are we doing
[1:34:45] is this Jesus
[1:34:48] we called
[1:34:50] the message
[1:35:01] I read one of my favorite scripture to
[1:35:03] you and then I will close
[1:35:05] it's supposed to be a prayer meeting now
[1:35:07] the preaching service tonight
[1:35:11] I thought we would just we prayed and
[1:35:13] then
[1:35:13] or we just sing some songs and just
[1:35:16] praise the Lord tonight
[1:35:22] one of my favorite scripture
[1:35:24] I was
[1:35:26] I was there on
[1:35:28] Monday night over in
[1:35:31] Springfield with Wesley and sister carra
[1:35:33] they send their greetings
[1:35:35] we had a good prayer meeting
[1:35:37] and were able to do a community service
[1:35:39] for them
[1:35:41] and
[1:35:43] and I used this scripture
[1:35:46] speaking to them then first John chapter
[1:35:48] one
[1:36:12] I hope that the law will be able to just
[1:36:14] give us an atmosphere here tonight
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:20] where we can just enter into his
[1:36:22] presence
[1:36:24] with Thanksgiving first John chapter one
[1:36:30] let's read verse 5.
[1:36:33] first John chapter 1 verse 5.
[1:36:37] this then
[1:36:39] is
[1:36:41] the message
[1:36:45] this
[1:36:47] AIDS the message
[1:36:50] people this
[1:36:53] then is the message
[1:36:56] which we have heard of him and declared
[1:36:59] unto you that God is light
[1:37:02] and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:37:09] praise the Lord
[1:37:11] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:37:13] him and walk in darkness we lied and do
[1:37:16] not the truth
[1:37:18] but if we walk in the light
[1:37:23] as he is in the light
[1:37:28] praise the Lord
[1:37:32] brother Brandon says walk in the light
[1:37:35] and more will unfold
[1:37:38] praise the Lord
[1:37:44] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:37:46] light we have Fellowship one with
[1:37:49] another
[1:37:50] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us
[1:37:52] from all sin
[1:37:58] praise the Lord
[1:38:05] now you see that uh
[1:38:08] John used this
[1:38:12] statement this is the message
[1:38:16] that we have heard from the beginning
[1:38:20] and he brought it in a way to make us to
[1:38:23] understand that John is saying
[1:38:26] that wish was from the beginning
[1:38:29] that we handle with our hands
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:40] you go back to verse one that's where he
[1:38:42] said that that wish was from the
[1:38:44] beginning
[1:38:45] which we have heard what was from the
[1:38:48] beginning in the beginning was the word
[1:38:50] that's right that's right the word was
[1:38:51] with God
[1:38:55] he says wish we have heard we heard our
[1:38:57] word from the beginning wish our eyes
[1:39:01] have seen we've seen it with our eyes
[1:39:04] which we have looked upon
[1:39:07] and we have handled
[1:39:11] the word
[1:39:13] of life
[1:39:15] so John is connecting the logos
[1:39:20] with Christ with Jesus
[1:39:25] amen
[1:39:27] and that's what he's calling the message
[1:39:29] yes this is the message
[1:39:40] for the life was manifested and we have
[1:39:44] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[1:39:46] you
[1:39:47] that internal life which was with the
[1:39:51] father and was manifested
[1:39:53] unto us that which we have seen and her
[1:39:58] declare we unto you that you're also may
[1:40:02] have fellowship with us
[1:40:04] and truly our fellowship is with the
[1:40:07] father
[1:40:08] and with his son
[1:40:11] Jesus Christ
[1:40:16] this then is the message
[1:40:24] so what are we doing
[1:40:28] with this Jesus
[1:40:31] we called the message
[1:40:38] praise the Lord
[1:40:41] that's what John is making us to see you
[1:40:45] he says that word from the beginning we
[1:40:47] handle and we want you also to come into
[1:40:50] Fellowship
[1:40:52] not just to hear it but for you to get
[1:40:55] the same kind of fulfilling
[1:40:59] the same kind of a fellowship
[1:41:02] just like we had
[1:41:05] praise the Lord now you have to realize
[1:41:08] that John is saying this after his
[1:41:11] experience on the island of Patmos
[1:41:16] After experiencing Jesus Ministry in a
[1:41:20] higher form
[1:41:21] than when he was with them
[1:41:26] so John is saying that we can get even
[1:41:30] more better Fellowship
[1:41:35] than if Jesus was in a corporate body
[1:41:38] right hear me
[1:41:41] he's saying that we can get a touch
[1:41:45] we can feel him we can hear from him
[1:41:48] we can speak to him he can speak back to
[1:41:51] us
[1:42:00] praise the Lord
[1:42:03] let me tell you people
[1:42:07] that this is what
[1:42:09] the message brought to us
[1:42:12] praise the Lord
[1:42:14] do you remember just like in the time of
[1:42:16] Samia
[1:42:18] when the Bible says after Israel has
[1:42:20] gone through such a dark period of time
[1:42:23] of the judges
[1:42:26] there was no opinion
[1:42:29] praise the Lord since the time
[1:42:33] of Joshua
[1:42:35] there was no open Vision in a sense
[1:42:37] there no one really experienced that
[1:42:40] Ministry
[1:42:42] of hearing the voice of God
[1:42:47] until that day
[1:42:49] when God spoke to little Samuel
[1:42:54] once again the voice of God has returned
[1:42:56] among the people
[1:43:02] praise the Lord
[1:43:06] what we have on our hands is almighty
[1:43:09] God
[1:43:13] what we have on our hands we call the
[1:43:15] message of the hour
[1:43:17] is the very word
[1:43:19] that created us
[1:43:25] it's a very word that knows our needs
[1:43:30] is the very word
[1:43:32] they have the answer to our problems
[1:43:39] yes that's the reason why the prophet of
[1:43:41] God says take a promise
[1:43:44] he says take a talking
[1:43:45] let the talking goes before your prayers
[1:43:55] praise the Lord
[1:43:57] how God
[1:43:59] being so mindful of us
[1:44:02] knowing that we will be in such a
[1:44:04] troubled age
[1:44:06] everything that would be happening
[1:44:08] around us
[1:44:10] and yet he came our way
[1:44:13] just like their Widow
[1:44:16] woman
[1:44:20] flower
[1:44:21] in her last boy
[1:44:24] praise the Lord
[1:44:27] why the whole land
[1:44:29] was going on a farming
[1:44:32] there was a widow woman
[1:44:36] spirit
[1:44:38] in new season
[1:44:41] amen praise the Lord
[1:44:44] I will tell you Saints
[1:44:46] if we really get into the message
[1:44:51] we really get into the word
[1:44:57] we will have less things to worry about
[1:45:02] because our our answers is not going to
[1:45:05] come from anywhere else
