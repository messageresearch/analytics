[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:40] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:00:42] amen amen God bless you musicians let's
[1:00:46] take our Bibles
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:49] uh
[1:00:52] and we will ask
[1:00:55] you to just bear with us let's read
[1:00:59] a scripture here
[1:01:01] very familiar to US during the time of
[1:01:04] communion
[1:01:05] but uh
[1:01:08] Paul speaks about Discerning the laws
[1:01:11] boarding so I want to read their
[1:01:13] scripture uh
[1:01:16] in their context then we go in right
[1:01:18] into what we want to say praise the Lord
[1:01:22] I know uh
[1:01:26] is being why since we had our last
[1:01:30] convenience service we uh we are praying
[1:01:33] and looking forward to the next one but
[1:01:37] this is the word of the Lord is now only
[1:01:39] for convenience service it is also an
[1:01:43] instruction
[1:01:44] from the Lord to us so let's just read
[1:01:47] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:01:56] we will
[1:01:59] some become a denomination if we just
[1:02:02] try setting scripture to just one
[1:02:05] activity
[1:02:06] amen
[1:02:08] and
[1:02:09] uh
[1:02:12] if we were not re-testinal learning all
[1:02:14] the time only when we have him buried
[1:02:16] and said though that are in Christ will
[1:02:18] rise first
[1:02:19] then we become in a denomination praise
[1:02:21] the Lord but let's read year First
[1:02:24] Corinthians chapter 11 reading from
[1:02:26] verse 23 for I have received of the Lord
[1:02:30] that which also I deliver unto you
[1:02:34] I thought about this scripture during
[1:02:36] the week because uh I was I was
[1:02:40] listening to a documentary of some uh
[1:02:45] historians
[1:02:47] that was talking about
[1:02:49] the early Creed what they call the early
[1:02:51] Creed sorry to keep you standing and
[1:02:54] what they call the early Creed was the
[1:02:57] little note
[1:02:58] that the disciples had
[1:03:01] that they were passing around from what
[1:03:03] the witness in in Jesus ministry
[1:03:07] and one of them were referring to this
[1:03:10] as something that was part of the early
[1:03:12] Cree because you have to remember Paul
[1:03:14] was not in the community the first
[1:03:16] communion service Paul was not in Saint
[1:03:19] John chapter 13. you know when they had
[1:03:21] a communion so they were referring to
[1:03:24] this that Paul got this from some of
[1:03:28] those little notes that were going
[1:03:30] around
[1:03:31] and uh so I went back and I started
[1:03:34] reading and I got into a little place
[1:03:36] here and and that's the reason why I
[1:03:38] paused because he says for I have
[1:03:40] received of the Lord
[1:03:43] that which I deliver unto you let's
[1:03:45] let's go ahead and read and then we will
[1:03:48] come in that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:03:51] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:03:53] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:03:56] breaks it and and said take it this is
[1:03:59] my body which is broken for you do this
[1:04:02] in remembrance of me the Bible says and
[1:04:06] then after the same manner he took the
[1:04:08] cup but let's uh let's let's drop down
[1:04:11] uh
[1:04:14] a little bit here verse 28 balletta a
[1:04:19] man is jamming himself and so let him
[1:04:22] eat of the bread and drink of the cup
[1:04:25] for he that eat it and drinketh on water
[1:04:28] it eat it and drink a damnation to
[1:04:31] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:04:36] the Lord bless you you may have your
[1:04:38] seed
[1:04:39] praise the Lord
[1:04:42] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:04:47] now so uh so I went back and then uh
[1:04:53] look into the scripture and I says well
[1:04:56] yeah
[1:04:57] I've always I've always
[1:04:59] taught and believed because Paul said I
[1:05:04] have received of the Lord that in some
[1:05:07] sense it was a kind of a Divine
[1:05:09] instruction that was given to him praise
[1:05:12] the Lord and because he was a prophet he
[1:05:16] was also taught by God through visions
[1:05:21] and uh but like I said we we will we
[1:05:26] will go back to some of our pictures and
[1:05:29] some of the things we shared on on
[1:05:32] Wednesday night but I want to go in a
[1:05:35] direction the reason why I read this
[1:05:36] scripture is because
[1:05:39] of first king let's go to the book of
[1:05:42] first king
[1:05:49] let's go to the book of first king
[1:05:51] chapter 3.
[1:05:53] and the scripture there that we're going
[1:05:55] to read actually it is it is where the
[1:05:59] Bible will talk about Solomon prayer we
[1:06:03] know it as Solomon prayer but the Bible
[1:06:05] which says that Solomon had a dream
[1:06:08] and uh and and uh and for the way that
[1:06:12] we've been taught a dream that that
[1:06:15] comes to pass a dream is a secondary
[1:06:18] vision
[1:06:19] praise the Lord so a direct dream is a
[1:06:23] vision
[1:06:23] it's just that the person didn't see it
[1:06:25] with their eye open but it's a vision
[1:06:27] now so if you look at the scripture here
[1:06:31] you know uh in the way that uh the Bible
[1:06:36] uh placed it
[1:06:38] I just want for us to just uh
[1:06:42] first king chapter 3.
[1:06:47] praise the Lord
[1:06:50] they are so uh Solomon will be asking
[1:06:54] the Lord of something and God will say
[1:06:56] that you ask the right thing I'm going
[1:06:58] to give it to you and the Bible we we
[1:07:01] mentioned Discerning judgment that was
[1:07:04] the reason why I read that First
[1:07:06] Corinthians uh scripture because we
[1:07:09] re-year that God gave Solomon a gift of
[1:07:13] discernment
[1:07:14] praise the Lord
[1:07:15] he gave him a gift of the sermon
[1:07:19] but let's read this together uh verse 3
[1:07:22] will give us a good picture here
[1:07:28] and Solomon loved the Lord walking in
[1:07:31] the Statue of David his father only he
[1:07:34] sacrificed and burned incense in high
[1:07:38] places now if you go back to verse 2 the
[1:07:42] Bible says only the people sacrifice in
[1:07:44] high places because there was no house
[1:07:47] bill on to the name of the Lord until
[1:07:51] those days now you will see a little bit
[1:07:55] here in in their reading that these
[1:07:59] places that is called high places
[1:08:03] where places where people there was
[1:08:07] something that bothered Israel India
[1:08:09] travel it was idolatrying
[1:08:12] amen it was idolatry so uh you you find
[1:08:17] that over and over in the book of Kings
[1:08:20] where it was hard for the people to get
[1:08:22] away from our dollar train and in so
[1:08:25] much that it was seeing God they were
[1:08:27] still going to those high places and
[1:08:30] burning incense
[1:08:33] praise the Lord
[1:08:35] are we together
[1:08:37] amen I don't want to lose you even
[1:08:39] though I'm slow but I don't want to lose
[1:08:41] you amen
[1:08:43] praise the Lord either I drag you or you
[1:08:46] drag me
[1:08:48] but I'll feel good if you do the dragon
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:56] but the reason why I pause a little bit
[1:09:00] is because this this context this place
[1:09:03] of high places you will realize that in
[1:09:06] the book of Ephesians the Bible says God
[1:09:08] has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:09:10] blessing in Heavenly places and in
[1:09:13] Ephesians chapter 6 The Bible will say
[1:09:15] stick up all the the whole armor of God
[1:09:18] We rise on that against uh flesh and
[1:09:21] blood but against principalities and
[1:09:23] spiritual weakness in high places so
[1:09:27] we have gone over there before so one of
[1:09:30] the things one of the things that as we
[1:09:33] continue in our journey we're going to
[1:09:35] look at the Tabernacle again and I'll
[1:09:37] show you some of those things that uh
[1:09:39] for which reason I want to come to this
[1:09:41] subject one of the things that we will
[1:09:44] constantly deal with until we leave this
[1:09:47] uh Earth and goes to our internal home
[1:09:50] will be idolatry
[1:09:53] praise the Lord it will come to us in
[1:09:57] different forms
[1:09:58] it will now be a worshiping Asian girls
[1:10:02] but it will be something that the enemy
[1:10:05] will want to live up in your life above
[1:10:08] the word of God anything that is lifted
[1:10:11] up in our life above the word of God is
[1:10:14] an idol
[1:10:17] praise the Lord
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:21] now so here the Bible says the people
[1:10:24] were going to the high places because
[1:10:26] there was no house that was built to the
[1:10:29] name of the Lord until that time verse 3
[1:10:31] again Solomon loved the Lord he walked
[1:10:34] in the statues of David his father only
[1:10:36] he sacrificed and burned incense in high
[1:10:39] places and the King went to gibeon to
[1:10:42] sacrifice therefore that was the great
[1:10:45] high place
[1:10:46] a thousand uh Brent offering did Solomon
[1:10:51] offer upon the altar in gibeon the Lord
[1:10:55] appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night
[1:11:01] and God said ask what Ash I gave thee
[1:11:06] praise the Lord what an opportunity if
[1:11:09] God will speak to us this morning which
[1:11:12] of course is speaking to you what will I
[1:11:15] give thee what is the primary thing on
[1:11:18] your heart that's one of the things I
[1:11:20] want for us to realize because you you
[1:11:22] see when you read the word we have a way
[1:11:26] of adjusting our mind
[1:11:28] praise the Lord of adjusting our mind
[1:11:31] but you you have to remember that God
[1:11:34] told Solomon and look at I mean God told
[1:11:36] Samuel and look at the heart
[1:11:39] it's not you adjusting your mind in the
[1:11:42] present circumstance or you adjusting
[1:11:45] your mind you know when the question is
[1:11:48] given to you but God is looking at your
[1:11:51] heart
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:58] you could be asked uh what what is that
[1:12:01] what is the most thing that the Lord
[1:12:03] that you will want for the Lord to do
[1:12:06] with you I may do for you and you were
[1:12:08] saying that
[1:12:09] um
[1:12:10] when you're doing that all you're trying
[1:12:12] to do you are adjusting your mind
[1:12:15] but God that knows the heart he already
[1:12:19] knows what is primary on your heart
[1:12:23] he knows what is primary on our heart
[1:12:26] this morning even though we are sitting
[1:12:29] in the house of the Lord we're saying
[1:12:30] God speak to me I want God to speak to
[1:12:33] me praise the Lord amen but he already
[1:12:37] knows what is the primary thing on your
[1:12:40] heart
[1:12:44] that's one of the things we want to look
[1:12:46] at this morning so the Bible says God
[1:12:48] asks Solomon
[1:12:50] and says ask what I shall give thee and
[1:12:54] Solomon said thou has shown unto their
[1:12:58] servant David my father great Mercy I
[1:13:01] calling to I call in as he walked before
[1:13:05] thee in truth and in righteousness and
[1:13:08] in uprightness
[1:13:11] praise the Lord
[1:13:16] in uprightness
[1:13:18] of heart with thee and there has
[1:13:22] kept for him
[1:13:24] this great kindness that thou have given
[1:13:27] him a son to sit on his throne as it is
[1:13:31] this day and now oh Lord my God
[1:13:35] there have made that seven King instead
[1:13:39] of David my father and and I am but a
[1:13:44] little child I know not how to go out or
[1:13:49] to come in praise the Lord
[1:13:55] last Sunday we saw through the word of
[1:13:58] the Lord how the kingdom was taken away
[1:14:00] from Saul
[1:14:02] amen
[1:14:03] praise the Lord because he was mad he
[1:14:07] was not obedient to the Consulate of the
[1:14:09] Lord he was not willing to follow God in
[1:14:11] order of his word the kingdom was taken
[1:14:13] from Saul and now we're seeing that the
[1:14:16] kingdom now and his David and David now
[1:14:18] is giving it over to his son and Solomon
[1:14:21] is rehearsing all of these things to the
[1:14:23] Lord he says I'm a child I know I know
[1:14:26] not how to go out and to come in and and
[1:14:30] i7 is in the midst of thy people which
[1:14:35] thou has chosen a great people that
[1:14:39] cannot be number
[1:14:41] non-countered for multitude praise the
[1:14:43] Lord amen the reason why they cannot be
[1:14:46] normal or counted is because God's
[1:14:49] presence surround His People
[1:14:51] praise the Lord
[1:14:53] amen give therefore that servant and
[1:14:56] understanding heart
[1:14:58] to judge thy people
[1:15:01] that I may discern between good and by
[1:15:06] praise the Lord that very thing that
[1:15:09] Solomon was praying for the Holy Ghost
[1:15:11] has brought it to us now this is the
[1:15:14] picture that I want us to grab this
[1:15:16] morning Solomon is saying your people is
[1:15:20] such of a great people I don't know how
[1:15:23] to go out I don't know how to handle
[1:15:25] them I don't know how to go out and come
[1:15:27] in among them I want an honest turning
[1:15:29] heart I want a spirit of discernment
[1:15:33] praise the Lord Paul in a new testament
[1:15:36] he's saying that the very thing that
[1:15:38] Solomon is saying Paul is saying that uh
[1:15:41] we we have to discern the body of the
[1:15:46] Lord
[1:15:47] we have to have a discernment of God's
[1:15:50] people
[1:15:51] amen
[1:15:53] we don't we don't judge them by their
[1:15:55] appearance or by the things that they
[1:15:57] are going through because just like
[1:16:00] Solomon says they are such a great
[1:16:02] people
[1:16:03] praise the Lord what is the greatness is
[1:16:07] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:16:11] that is the greatness it's not the
[1:16:13] building it's not the amount of people
[1:16:15] but these this is the people that are
[1:16:18] possessing Jesus Christ
[1:16:24] are you seeing the picture
[1:16:27] so Paul is saying that uh
[1:16:32] that's one thing we must watch to
[1:16:34] discern the body of the Lord
[1:16:39] praise the Lord
[1:16:40] because that scripture is generally and
[1:16:44] mostly read during communion is so easy
[1:16:48] for for for for for the devil to get it
[1:16:51] on our mind that that is only speaking
[1:16:53] about communion but we know it is not
[1:16:57] Discerning the Lost body that's where
[1:16:59] brother Brandon preached from
[1:17:02] that was the scripture that he read
[1:17:06] that's what we are called to do
[1:17:10] is to discern God's body
[1:17:15] the way we think about God's children
[1:17:17] the things we say about them
[1:17:25] Solomon is saying your people are such a
[1:17:27] great people
[1:17:28] I'm just a child
[1:17:32] praise the Lord
[1:17:39] and no matter how long we've been
[1:17:41] serving the lord
[1:17:43] this is not on our natural age group
[1:17:48] it's also understanding what God is
[1:17:50] doing among his people
[1:17:56] praise the Lord
[1:17:57] it's what God is doing among his people
[1:18:00] as a local body what God is doing among
[1:18:03] his people as uh uh uh as a word body
[1:18:13] because sometimes when we're wearing
[1:18:15] ourselves Russia's cult
[1:18:17] we're wearing a coat of
[1:18:19] self-righteousness we speak so
[1:18:21] carelessly
[1:18:22] about God's people we speak about things
[1:18:26] just like Jude would say in the book of
[1:18:28] Jude things that we don't understand
[1:18:30] about
[1:18:32] foreign
[1:18:34] things that we don't understand
[1:18:38] and we think we know
[1:18:43] praise the Lord
[1:18:44] Solomon is saying here gave thy servant
[1:18:48] and understanding heart
[1:18:50] to judge the people
[1:18:53] praise the Lord
[1:18:58] that word George
[1:19:00] was not to tell who's right or who's
[1:19:03] wrong
[1:19:07] it comes from that sense of the word to
[1:19:09] discern
[1:19:11] praise the Lord
[1:19:14] to discern
[1:19:17] Lord help me to be slow to speak
[1:19:23] praise the Lord
[1:19:27] let me pray to understand what's really
[1:19:29] happening
[1:19:33] are we together
[1:19:35] to judge the people that I may discern
[1:19:38] between good and bad
[1:19:40] for who is able to judge this they are
[1:19:45] so great a people
[1:19:47] praise the Lord
[1:19:49] and sometimes we don't see it like that
[1:19:51] we get so familiar with one another you
[1:19:53] know we can we can just swing through
[1:19:55] our mind we know everybody in the church
[1:19:57] whether we know their name on that you
[1:19:59] know and then we feel like we know there
[1:20:01] are situations
[1:20:03] we feel like we know what they are
[1:20:05] dealing with
[1:20:08] sure oh is it not that one
[1:20:12] nothing funny here
[1:20:13] nothing funny
[1:20:16] nothing funny
[1:20:20] I want us to see the real picture
[1:20:24] he says who is able to judge this
[1:20:30] if we realize that the church
[1:20:36] is containing the mystery of God
[1:20:39] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:20:45] praise the Lord
[1:20:48] we will be very careful
[1:20:54] you will be very very careful
[1:21:00] some of the things we think in our mind
[1:21:02] even though we don't say it but the way
[1:21:04] our mind runs
[1:21:08] we will be careful who is able
[1:21:12] to judge this
[1:21:14] there are so great a people and their
[1:21:18] speech please the Lord that Solomon
[1:21:21] heart acts distinct
[1:21:24] and God said unto him because thou have
[1:21:28] asked this thing and have not asked for
[1:21:31] themselves long life neither have asked
[1:21:34] riches for themselves none have asked
[1:21:37] the life of thine enemy
[1:21:40] but have asked for
[1:21:43] thyself almost turning to discern
[1:21:46] judgment
[1:21:49] understanding to discern judgment
[1:21:53] understanding to know what to say in a
[1:21:57] given time of crisis
[1:22:04] not just only to talk from a place of
[1:22:08] hurt
[1:22:13] praise the Lord because you also have to
[1:22:16] realize that nothing will befall you
[1:22:19] except the Lord allow it
[1:22:22] and if the Lord allowed that is his way
[1:22:25] of pulling you on his will
[1:22:27] to spin you
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:34] now so understanding
[1:22:37] to discern judgment to know what to say
[1:22:40] in every giving moment
[1:22:43] the law said because you have asked that
[1:22:45] behold
[1:22:48] ah
[1:22:49] I have done I call into thy words Lord I
[1:22:55] have given deed a wise and an
[1:22:58] understanding heart so that there was
[1:23:02] none like thee before the neither after
[1:23:05] thee shall earning arise like unto thee
[1:23:10] praise the Lord
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:15] the internet give us access to you know
[1:23:18] many things flying up on social media
[1:23:21] Google and YouTube and all of that you
[1:23:24] know we you know you can hear about
[1:23:26] something in South Africa or go right on
[1:23:29] YouTube and put it up and you watch it
[1:23:31] and pretty soon you know what was there
[1:23:33] I mean you can be talking as if to say
[1:23:34] you were there
[1:23:35] I said to say you met the people
[1:23:43] well may God give us Grace
[1:23:46] amen
[1:23:47] may God give us Grace
[1:23:49] the Lord said behold I have done this
[1:23:51] you know while you you ask a good thing
[1:23:54] I have given it to thee I won't want to
[1:23:57] spend much of a time here on this but
[1:24:00] you will realize that the Bible says
[1:24:02] here in verse 15 and Solomon awoke and
[1:24:06] behold it was a dream
[1:24:08] and he came to Jerusalem and stood
[1:24:12] before the Ark of the Covenant of the
[1:24:15] Lord and offer a burnt offering and
[1:24:18] offer peace offering and made a feast to
[1:24:21] uh to all his seven realizing it was a
[1:24:24] dream he came right before the Lord he
[1:24:26] lived for his hands he said a word of
[1:24:28] prayer to the Lord he you know committed
[1:24:30] all in the hands of the law then the
[1:24:31] scripture will tell us right after death
[1:24:34] God is going to bring there to
[1:24:36] manifestation because that will be the
[1:24:38] time the two women who are I will be
[1:24:40] will be wrestling over the baby and then
[1:24:43] uh and then Solomon would say bring the
[1:24:46] baby here you caught the baby into half
[1:24:48] sense one there is we don't know who the
[1:24:51] child is what actually he was looking
[1:24:53] for he was looking for feeling because
[1:24:56] there is feeling in love
[1:24:59] amen he was looking for feeling
[1:25:04] praise the Lord
[1:25:06] amen the one that that had no attachment
[1:25:09] she said yeah that's the best thing you
[1:25:11] killed the child the one that had
[1:25:13] attachment she said no give it to her
[1:25:16] and Solomon who discerned right there
[1:25:21] praise the Lord
[1:25:24] you see he was not quick quick to speak
[1:25:28] he was not even convinced by their tears
[1:25:34] all the way they were I mean
[1:25:37] explaining he was not convinced by that
[1:25:40] he went for something more
[1:25:46] he was not looking at our appearance
[1:25:53] how well you can explain your case and
[1:25:55] no no no he was looking for something
[1:25:58] more
[1:26:00] he was looking for something inside
[1:26:03] something that was not seen by the
[1:26:05] natural eyes
[1:26:11] praise the Lord so we see here that the
[1:26:15] Lord granted him
[1:26:18] the Lord granted him
[1:26:20] this gift of discernment
[1:26:23] we're coming back to our Tabernacle I'm
[1:26:25] just I'm just trying to find my 14 year
[1:26:27] don't worry
[1:26:28] praise the Lord then the Bible will led
[1:26:30] us to note over in chapter four
[1:26:34] if you want to go there with me quickly
[1:26:36] the last few verses in chapter 4 the
[1:26:40] Bible will let us to know in verse 29
[1:26:42] and God gave Solomon wisdom
[1:26:44] understanding exceeding much and
[1:26:47] lastness of heart even as the sin that
[1:26:50] is on the sea show and Solomon wisdom
[1:26:53] Excel the wisdom of the children of the
[1:26:57] East Country and all the wisdom of Egypt
[1:26:59] for he was wise he called all of those
[1:27:03] wise men of those days verse 32 and he
[1:27:07] speak 3 000 Proverbs and his Psalms were
[1:27:11] a thousand and five
[1:27:14] he speaks of three you know you you read
[1:27:17] that in the book of of of proverb he
[1:27:20] says he says uh uh see the way of an ant
[1:27:25] amen
[1:27:27] amen he look at his look at the ants
[1:27:30] he's he's saying God's wisdom in the
[1:27:32] ants he said look at the word of the ego
[1:27:35] he said three things that's too
[1:27:36] wonderful for me
[1:27:38] and all of these things the scripture
[1:27:40] says where Solomon wisdom
[1:27:43] he could look at those things and he
[1:27:45] could pull knowledge out of them
[1:27:48] praise the Lord
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:52] but
[1:27:54] the thing that is uh uh
[1:28:00] uh the thing that is that is uh uh that
[1:28:04] is wonderful year
[1:28:05] is that
[1:28:07] you will see the other with all of this
[1:28:10] wisdom that Solomon had
[1:28:14] praise the Lord when you come to the New
[1:28:17] Testament
[1:28:18] even our lord Jesus
[1:28:21] even our lord Jesus
[1:28:25] will say Solomon in all of his wisdom
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:33] Solomon in all of his wisdom cannot be
[1:28:36] compared to the ladies of the field
[1:28:40] our lord Jesus was saved and he will
[1:28:43] also say yeah
[1:28:46] greater than Solomon is here
[1:28:50] are we together
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:56] so God blessed Solomon with wisdom
[1:28:59] but you realize that it was temporary
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:06] and Paul will capitalize on that where
[1:29:10] there is wisdom it will fill
[1:29:13] where there is prophecies it would seize
[1:29:16] he will come in the book of Corinthians
[1:29:18] and he will he will catch that
[1:29:21] it was temporary because with all the
[1:29:24] wisdom that Solomon had he couldn't keep
[1:29:27] himself from trouble
[1:29:30] his wisdom could not keep him from
[1:29:33] idolatrying
[1:29:37] yes that's the picture I want us to see
[1:29:39] this morning
[1:29:42] amen with all the wisdom he had it was
[1:29:45] not one that he acquired in school it
[1:29:48] was something that God gave him
[1:29:55] praise the Lord
[1:29:57] it was something that God gave him
[1:30:01] but yet Jesus would come
[1:30:05] oh the Bible says even all the princes
[1:30:09] the the Queen of Sheba and all of those
[1:30:10] people they admire Solomon wisdom
[1:30:16] but yet
[1:30:17] he didn't have wisdom enough
[1:30:21] to keep himself
[1:30:23] away from his idols
[1:30:30] praise the Lord he didn't have wisdom
[1:30:33] enough to keep himself away from our
[1:30:36] idolatry he married you know all of his
[1:30:39] wife and fell by their idols and and and
[1:30:42] and and and Ecclesiastes he would tell
[1:30:44] us about the vanity of life
[1:30:50] but what I want us to think about this
[1:30:52] morning before we get into our subject
[1:30:54] if I will have time to preach
[1:30:57] let's make a contrast
[1:31:00] with Solomon Father David
[1:31:06] let's make a contrast with Solomon
[1:31:09] Father David
[1:31:11] Psalm chapter 27.
[1:31:25] love the Lord
[1:31:28] praise the Lord
[1:31:32] the Lord is guilty
[1:31:37] amen
[1:31:41] are we together
[1:31:47] we know that the Bible called David
[1:31:50] a man after God's Own Heart
[1:31:53] praise the Lord
[1:31:54] the Bible will show us some
[1:31:56] characteristics of David
[1:31:58] and one of the things was very hard a
[1:32:01] repented heart
[1:32:03] David was was was one of the men that
[1:32:05] will run to God quickly
[1:32:08] amen he had a repainted heart
[1:32:12] but here in this Psalm there is
[1:32:15] something that is placed here of David I
[1:32:17] won't read the whole Psalm you know what
[1:32:19] it is you can go read it meditate upon
[1:32:21] it memorize it it will do you good but
[1:32:23] let's read verse four David
[1:32:26] expressing here in this prayer he said
[1:32:29] one thing half a desire of the Lord
[1:32:33] that I will seek after
[1:32:36] not wisdom
[1:32:38] not knowledge
[1:32:41] one thing my inner desire
[1:32:48] praise the Lord
[1:32:51] Solomon asked God for wisdom because
[1:32:56] he he saw how his father the influence
[1:33:01] that his father had
[1:33:03] no
[1:33:04] even there Solomon never had to fight
[1:33:07] one war
[1:33:10] everything that Solomon Solomon just
[1:33:13] built the temple David paid for it
[1:33:15] David was the one that paid for it
[1:33:19] go to Haram
[1:33:21] go to Tasha's he sent him all over gave
[1:33:25] him his contact
[1:33:28] he pay for it
[1:33:32] praise the Lord
[1:33:36] with his character with his contact
[1:33:44] are we together
[1:33:46] so Solomon was asking for for for wisdom
[1:33:51] from the law because he he realized I I
[1:33:54] don't want to mess this thing up
[1:33:57] praise the Lord
[1:33:58] amen
[1:34:00] this thing that has been given to me I I
[1:34:03] don't want to mess it up I don't want to
[1:34:04] put myself to the play Lord I really
[1:34:06] need wisdom
[1:34:09] to be able to deal with all and when you
[1:34:12] read you read Solomon
[1:34:15] one of the way he kept peace with the
[1:34:18] Nations around him was Every Nation
[1:34:20] around here he took a wife from the King
[1:34:27] praise the Lord
[1:34:30] so if you want to fight me you're coming
[1:34:31] okay your daughter and your
[1:34:33] grandchildren
[1:34:37] praise the Lord
[1:34:42] are you seeing the picture here
[1:34:45] are you seeing the picture because it
[1:34:47] will not mean much to you if we're going
[1:34:50] to December this morning if you don't
[1:34:51] see the picture David said one thing
[1:34:54] have a desire of the Lord
[1:34:57] therefore I seek after
[1:35:02] praise the Lord
[1:35:03] that I made the word in the house of the
[1:35:06] Lord
[1:35:07] all the days of my life one thing have I
[1:35:12] desire even if I don't understand the
[1:35:14] mystery if I make mistakes but my desire
[1:35:18] My driven desire is that I would work in
[1:35:22] the house of the Lord
[1:35:24] all the days of my life
[1:35:34] to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:35:37] entering choir to learn
[1:35:41] to learn of him
[1:35:45] praise the Lord
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:50] poured on an inspiration who picked that
[1:35:53] up in Corinthians chapter 11 where he
[1:35:55] talks about the the the the love chapter
[1:36:01] he will pick that up
[1:36:03] to let us to know
[1:36:05] the word there is wisdom it will fail
[1:36:09] amen
[1:36:12] he says wisdom knowledge puff up
[1:36:19] if it is not driven by love
[1:36:24] if God is Not on on the throne of your
[1:36:28] heart it would just be for Showmanship
[1:36:34] praise the Lord
[1:36:37] and it will still not do you any good
[1:36:42] so I wanted to bring I wanted to bring
[1:36:44] this contract this morning
[1:36:46] to be able to build
[1:36:48] a foundation grab your attention this
[1:36:52] morning since I'm slow
[1:36:54] that my slowness will not confuse you
[1:36:57] praise the Lord
[1:36:59] amen
[1:37:03] and uh
[1:37:06] so you see there in Old Testament I mean
[1:37:08] in the New Testament
[1:37:10] Solomon Glory
[1:37:13] was was them on his his glory in Old
[1:37:16] Testament in his time it was it was
[1:37:18] glorious but all of that but when it
[1:37:21] came over to the New Testament there was
[1:37:23] not much that was accounted for his
[1:37:25] glory
[1:37:27] praise the Lord
[1:37:29] Solomon in all his glory
[1:37:31] could not be like one of the ladies amen
[1:37:36] and Jesus said
[1:37:38] you are greater than the ladies
[1:37:42] so he was trying to say there is a
[1:37:44] greater glory
[1:37:46] that is coming on you
[1:37:48] amen there's a greater glory that the
[1:37:52] Holy Ghost brings on the believer
[1:37:56] then the glory of wealth and wives
[1:38:00] in Hershey's
[1:38:02] in homes
[1:38:04] there is a greater glory
[1:38:06] that the Holy Ghost brings upon the
[1:38:08] believer
[1:38:10] because she's supposed to be glory
[1:38:11] greater than Solomon is here amen
[1:38:15] now so with with that background
[1:38:19] with that background if I'm not mistaken
[1:38:22] as you have a
[1:38:24] uh one quote here from from Discerning
[1:38:28] the laws Discerning the body of the Lord
[1:38:30] let's read that and then we can we can
[1:38:34] go back into our Wednesday night subject
[1:38:36] now uh just to be able to
[1:38:40] kind of a close-up and wrap the whole
[1:38:42] thing up amen
[1:38:45] Discerning the body of the Lord barbam
[1:38:47] says that now our internal destination
[1:38:50] is now altogether determined by what we
[1:38:54] see
[1:38:56] or what we year
[1:38:59] praise the Lord but it's determined on
[1:39:04] what discernment
[1:39:06] what Josh meant
[1:39:08] we make
[1:39:10] amen what discernment we have of what we
[1:39:14] see
[1:39:16] and what we hear
[1:39:19] praise the Lord
[1:39:22] Hallelujah
[1:39:24] amen so if our our
[1:39:27] sisters will help us let's go back there
[1:39:32] and look at the Old Testament Tabernacle
[1:39:36] uh that would be one of
[1:39:38] uh the the
[1:39:41] one of the First pictures
[1:39:43] we put up if you just go by by the order
[1:39:47] of the pictures
[1:39:48] the first one will be the Old Testament
[1:39:50] Tabernacle
[1:39:53] are we together
[1:39:54] I'm sure I didn't lost you amen
[1:39:58] show up they lost you
[1:40:06] praise the Lord
[1:40:08] just like we said it was a faction that
[1:40:11] God gave to Moses
[1:40:13] and uh
[1:40:16] yes that's right
[1:40:18] and and and and and and Moses
[1:40:22] bring this blueprint of the Tabernacle
[1:40:26] and then Solomon will will bear on it
[1:40:30] will go and see there with Solomon now
[1:40:33] so with the Tabernacle here there are
[1:40:35] just few things that I wanted for us to
[1:40:37] to look at
[1:40:39] praise the Lord
[1:40:40] this is the auto Court of the Tabernacle
[1:40:43] is this the inner call and this is the
[1:40:45] holiest of holy now one thing you will
[1:40:48] realize here is that the auto call this
[1:40:51] is the place of sacrifice the altar the
[1:40:54] sacrifice the the lovers and and this
[1:40:58] will will will will represent
[1:41:01] uh uh the Justified believer
[1:41:05] this would be justification you know I
[1:41:08] believe the Lord what and but what I
[1:41:10] want us to see is that this man that is
[1:41:14] outside he's not in the auto Court he's
[1:41:16] outside outside the whole outside yeah
[1:41:19] amen
[1:41:22] benefit from the light off
[1:41:25] the Sun
[1:41:27] and the moon he benefit from the natural
[1:41:30] light
[1:41:31] the man that is that have crossed this
[1:41:34] gate and have come into Christ by faith
[1:41:37] also benefit from the same light
[1:41:40] praise the Lord I'll take a little speed
[1:41:43] on that it may it tells us now remember
[1:41:46] man we're talking about Discerning we're
[1:41:49] talking about uh uh uh uh uh adjustment
[1:41:53] so right here because this person is
[1:41:57] benefiting from the the natural light
[1:42:01] year most of the things
[1:42:04] that we believe we are also driven by
[1:42:08] our five senses
[1:42:11] praise the Lord amen
[1:42:14] we we you know we we we we talk about it
[1:42:18] you know we we feel the presence of the
[1:42:21] Lord and you know and then uh you know
[1:42:24] and you know someone talk to you you get
[1:42:26] sad it it looks to you like the
[1:42:28] president don't love you you know it's
[1:42:30] it's just you are just driving by your
[1:42:32] senses
[1:42:36] just like the man outside
[1:42:40] there is there is a little sense of
[1:42:42] Faith here
[1:42:43] amen
[1:42:46] but you are on the much of the influence
[1:42:49] of your five senses right here right in
[1:42:52] here like we said
[1:42:56] right here here was uh the candlestick
[1:43:03] right here is the Candlestick so this
[1:43:05] person in you
[1:43:08] in here
[1:43:10] is driven by candle light
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:16] the light is under his honor Candlelight
[1:43:19] this person is on the daylight natural
[1:43:23] light
[1:43:24] this this guy right in here he's
[1:43:27] influenced by candlelight and what
[1:43:29] happens to the candle light is the other
[1:43:31] it can get dim
[1:43:33] if the oil goes dry
[1:43:36] amen sometimes they can smoke up
[1:43:42] are we together
[1:43:44] Hallelujah
[1:43:46] you see but because this guy right here
[1:43:49] knows that he's on a candlelight uh uh
[1:43:53] uh what what happens to him is that uh
[1:43:56] if if he's if he stood that
[1:43:58] understanding uh uh I mean what whether
[1:44:01] whether he feels good or mad he knows
[1:44:05] that he he have a place with God
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:11] he just know that the world that is is a
[1:44:14] spiritual warfare he has to fight you
[1:44:16] know he he needs breakthrough you know
[1:44:18] uh he he he he he uh he concentrates to
[1:44:22] the word
[1:44:24] praise the Lord
[1:44:26] but behind the veil here
[1:44:29] was the Shekinah
[1:44:34] the glory of the Lord
[1:44:37] amen
[1:44:40] the presence of the Lord here was what
[1:44:43] create a light
[1:44:46] it was God's presence the light in this
[1:44:49] place
[1:44:54] are we together
[1:44:56] so this is this is this is in our walk
[1:45:02] as as believers this is our walk this is
[1:45:05] the place that we walk
[1:45:08] we came from right in the word saved by
[1:45:10] grace we came true here
[1:45:13] amen we believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:16] that he died for our sin
[1:45:19] we identify with him in water baptism
[1:45:24] if you have not done it there is no
[1:45:26] reason why you should be uh serving God
[1:45:29] and you're now baptized in the name of
[1:45:31] the Lord Jesus yet
[1:45:34] are we together
[1:45:37] and then we go into our our Nest stage
[1:45:41] of walk
[1:45:42] that has to do with the the
[1:45:45] sanctification the place of
[1:45:46] sanctification so you see here this is
[1:45:49] the the the Candlestick and this is the
[1:45:52] the table of ShopRite
[1:45:58] so right there is word you really start
[1:46:00] feeling on the word
[1:46:03] amen
[1:46:04] is easy to feel on man's idea
[1:46:09] praise the Lord
[1:46:12] you're looking for a solution you can
[1:46:14] feel on anything
[1:46:17] can make sense to you
[1:46:20] anything that they put Jesus on can make
[1:46:23] sense to you but a man that is in here
[1:46:26] he's eating only the shortbread
[1:46:30] praise the Lord
[1:46:32] watch this David when when David went to
[1:46:35] the Tabernacle when he was running away
[1:46:37] he met the priest he says my man I'm
[1:46:38] hungry is there anything to eat the
[1:46:40] priesthood is only only the shortbread
[1:46:43] if your man has kept themselves from
[1:46:45] women
[1:46:48] so even at that time the priest was
[1:46:51] demanding a level of Life of
[1:46:53] sanctification
[1:47:01] are we together
[1:47:05] so we see here all of these three stages
[1:47:08] that are light year this high priest
[1:47:11] that goes in here one time in in a year
[1:47:15] he's affected by the presence of God
[1:47:20] yeah it was the presence of God that was
[1:47:23] Lighting in the place
[1:47:26] it was the presence of God the heart the
[1:47:30] glory in the place
[1:47:33] they don't have to walk are worried
[1:47:36] about whether the the the light will go
[1:47:39] off or not
[1:47:42] and right in year the Mana that felt
[1:47:46] that they took from from outside year
[1:47:49] when it got in here it never died
[1:47:53] it never get rotten
[1:47:55] it was sustained by the presence of God
[1:48:01] are we together
[1:48:03] amen
[1:48:05] and also right in here that was where
[1:48:07] Aaron Rod was also pulled
[1:48:11] a dry Road
[1:48:13] started to bring for leaves
[1:48:16] because it was affected
[1:48:18] by the presence of God
[1:48:23] praise the Lord
[1:48:25] it was affected by the presence of God
[1:48:28] in the building year we don't have a
[1:48:30] split into three places
[1:48:33] where we say it's okay that you stay oh
[1:48:35] yeah we all comes into the building
[1:48:38] but yet in our walk in our stages of
[1:48:41] walk
[1:48:45] we still have these three steps right in
[1:48:48] this building this morning
[1:48:57] are we together
[1:49:12] now I thought that I would have brought
[1:49:14] a little picture of uh talking about
[1:49:18] light
[1:49:20] talking about light I was I was uh
[1:49:25] trying to rush in and and and get that
[1:49:28] in uh uh but uh it kind of
[1:49:32] uh kind of a loss there
[1:49:37] what actually I would have wanted to do
[1:49:39] with that is that I was going to show
[1:49:43] uh
[1:49:46] the Candlestick light that was drawn
[1:49:48] during the church ages
[1:49:52] praise the Lord
[1:49:53] just like how it was uh uh
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:49:58] uh
[1:50:00] how it is with the believer is also uh
[1:50:06] uh dispensational
[1:50:08] with the ages
[1:50:10] but I will look for it another time to
[1:50:13] be able to bring that so we can we can
[1:50:15] be able to see that
[1:50:18] as we as we look at that
[1:50:22] praise the Lord are we together
[1:50:24] amen
[1:50:32] now so that was the tabernacle
[1:50:35] there was the tabernacle
[1:50:38] that we just we just show you
[1:50:40] can we go to the picture of the Temple
[1:50:47] yeah I think I still have a few minutes
[1:51:00] praise the Lord
[1:51:04] um
[1:51:06] Solomon on an inspiration came and he
[1:51:11] built a temple
[1:51:13] just with the same pattern that Moses
[1:51:17] built the Tabernacle
[1:51:19] Sunday I mean Wednesday now we spoke
[1:51:22] about the two pillows and this was
[1:51:25] called Solomon porch
[1:51:28] on the temple but it was the porch of
[1:51:31] the the so what what I want to go into
[1:51:34] now
[1:51:35] this morning as I talked about
[1:51:39] uh been on the ah the influence of light
[1:51:43] the light that is outside affect the
[1:51:46] person on a justification it affect the
[1:51:48] person in the in the auto call he he can
[1:51:51] only benefit from the sunlight or the
[1:51:53] Moonlight the natural light the the
[1:51:56] person in the inner call benefit from
[1:51:59] the the
[1:52:01] Candlestick light amen the the benefit
[1:52:06] from the candles still lie so that's the
[1:52:08] reason why you will see it in Revelation
[1:52:11] chapter one it talks about the seven
[1:52:15] golden Candlestick amen and if you go to
[1:52:19] Revelation chapter 1 you will realize
[1:52:22] that the church Ages was either Seven
[1:52:27] golden candlesticks or what Seven Stars
[1:52:32] so the church ages will be it will be a
[1:52:35] night period
[1:52:40] praise the Lord
[1:52:42] it will be a night period that's the
[1:52:44] reason why brother Brandon will tell us
[1:52:46] that the messenger comes at the end of
[1:52:48] the age
[1:52:51] are we together
[1:52:53] in Revelation chapter 1 the church Ages
[1:52:56] was represented by the the the golden
[1:52:59] candlesticks the all seven stars in the
[1:53:03] right hand of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:05] and stars only come up in the night
[1:53:09] praise the Lord
[1:53:11] now but but just like I said
[1:53:14] on Wednesday night
[1:53:16] there is something that was that was a
[1:53:19] little bit different from the Tabernacle
[1:53:22] what is that it is these little rooms
[1:53:25] back here
[1:53:28] praise the Lord
[1:53:29] when Solomon built a tabernacle this
[1:53:33] storage were built here for the priests
[1:53:37] and it is in yet the priests kept
[1:53:41] their idols
[1:53:44] praise the Lord oh I say I just because
[1:53:47] I knew you would get your attention
[1:53:51] I knew it would get your attention but
[1:53:55] what does that represent to us now you
[1:53:58] have to know that what God was stubborn
[1:54:01] was was targeting to do it in with you
[1:54:07] he do not do it in Temple made with
[1:54:09] hands
[1:54:11] he started from the Tabernacle of Moses
[1:54:13] that were built with King he came to the
[1:54:15] Temple of Solomon but what God was
[1:54:18] targeting
[1:54:19] is to do it in you
[1:54:25] praise the Lord
[1:54:27] so Solomon
[1:54:29] Solomon Tabernacle
[1:54:34] it brings out more picture
[1:54:37] yeah
[1:54:40] that we never saw in the Tabernacle of
[1:54:42] Moses the temple brings out more
[1:54:45] pictures uh Wednesday night we read
[1:54:48] seven scripture where Paul identified us
[1:54:51] as the Temple of the Living God
[1:54:54] amen
[1:54:56] now so there is something that we deal
[1:54:59] with
[1:55:00] as we were looking uh uh Wednesday night
[1:55:03] we deal with this we talk about these
[1:55:06] these two poachers meaning uh
[1:55:09] established in counsel and strength and
[1:55:12] uh one is Council Jacob and Boaz his
[1:55:15] strength and as we said they were placed
[1:55:18] there for Monument they were placed
[1:55:20] there for a testament they never had
[1:55:22] nothing to do in hole in the Tabernacle
[1:55:24] God was just showing that uh he's
[1:55:28] building his Tabernacle he says I'll be
[1:55:30] in my church the gifts of Hell will not
[1:55:31] Prevail against it amen now so we we
[1:55:36] look at this
[1:55:38] and uh
[1:55:43] we went back a little bit and and we
[1:55:45] were looking at what Moses said in
[1:55:47] Deuteronomy chapter 6. you know Ezra the
[1:55:51] Lord your God is one love the Lord with
[1:55:53] all of your heart
[1:55:55] out of your mind
[1:55:56] out of your strength
[1:55:58] no love the Lord with all of your heart
[1:56:00] out of your soul
[1:56:02] out of your mind and all of your
[1:56:05] strength
[1:56:06] praise the Lord
[1:56:08] in the in the New Testament Mark chapter
[1:56:10] 12 verse telling Jesus will pick up the
[1:56:13] same thing
[1:56:15] amen
[1:56:17] he says which commandment is the
[1:56:19] greatest he says Thou know
[1:56:22] amen
[1:56:24] and he repeated exactly because he was a
[1:56:28] prophet like unto Moses he repeated
[1:56:30] exactly what
[1:56:32] Jesus I mean Moses said
[1:56:36] are we together
[1:56:41] praise the Lord
[1:56:44] Paul
[1:56:45] will come in Hebrew chapter 4 verse 12.
[1:56:49] now you have to remember we went through
[1:56:51] we went over all of this amen I'm just
[1:56:53] trying to bring it together so if I if
[1:56:56] we turn into every scripture it would
[1:56:58] take up much time you can write it down
[1:57:00] and and read it we read about that and
[1:57:03] in Hebrew 4 12 the word of God is
[1:57:06] sharper than any two edges swore
[1:57:09] amen peers in the heart going to the
[1:57:13] dividing asunder that's what I want I
[1:57:16] want to do her on this morning because
[1:57:18] it would it will help us to understand
[1:57:21] what these things are
[1:57:22] around the temple
[1:57:25] you are the temple of God but you have
[1:57:27] these little pockets
[1:57:29] you know brother Brian will speak in the
[1:57:31] message those indoors
[1:57:33] and he will let us to know how we open
[1:57:36] the door of our heart to the Lord but
[1:57:38] there are other doors that we will not
[1:57:40] allow God to enter in
[1:57:42] he will bring that picture
[1:57:45] so we can be able to see that's what
[1:57:47] this in Solomon temples will represent
[1:57:51] another thing that this thing will
[1:57:53] represent also will be
[1:57:57] our subconscious
[1:58:01] our subconscious our pockets
[1:58:05] were Idols are kept
[1:58:11] the Bible says a wounded Spirit who can
[1:58:13] heal
[1:58:16] praise the Lord
[1:58:20] so all of these storage year around
[1:58:23] where you have to realize that the
[1:58:26] temple
[1:58:27] representing you there is nothing that
[1:58:30] was placed on Solomon Temple that does
[1:58:33] not speak of you
[1:58:42] are we together
[1:58:53] so we see here
[1:58:58] because we will not be able to see
[1:59:00] ourselves perfectly or to be able to
[1:59:03] bring this thing through we got to look
[1:59:04] at the temple so we we look we already
[1:59:06] talk about the the influence of light uh
[1:59:09] the article like inner Collide the
[1:59:11] presence of God the glory of God and uh
[1:59:15] uh because
[1:59:21] now so these uh these these uh
[1:59:25] personal storage
[1:59:28] pockets
[1:59:34] it comes to speak to the believer
[1:59:39] and it it it it it led us to know that
[1:59:42] uh because just like I said
[1:59:46] the Bible says love the Lord with all of
[1:59:50] your heart
[1:59:52] amen is not talking about that that
[1:59:56] place where the the blood comes from
[2:00:01] are we together
[2:00:04] amen
[2:00:05] law of the law with all of your mind
[2:00:08] Paul in the Book of Romans will led us
[2:00:10] to see how the mind and the spirit the
[2:00:13] similarity between the mind and the
[2:00:15] spirit
[2:00:19] loving the Lord with all of your spirit
[2:00:24] loving the Lord will order off your
[2:00:27] strength like we said Wednesday night is
[2:00:29] not talking about your energy
[2:00:31] because I'm telling you these guys that
[2:00:33] are doing weight lifting they can have
[2:00:35] more energy than you and myself
[2:00:42] are we together
[2:00:43] but Paul will let us to know that the
[2:00:46] word of God is sharper than the
[2:00:48] two-edges swore the word is able to go
[2:00:52] and be able to tell us out of this
[2:00:56] Pockets what it is
[2:01:00] praise the Lord
[2:01:01] the world will tell you when it is your
[2:01:05] spirit or when it is your soul
[2:01:08] Brothers will tell us that the boy they
[2:01:10] have five senses
[2:01:12] and that's how that's how come we can
[2:01:14] contact the outer part of our body he
[2:01:17] will talks about how the spirit also
[2:01:19] have five senses
[2:01:21] amen
[2:01:23] but the soul have one sense he said it's
[2:01:25] either Faith or doubt you are either
[2:01:27] driven by faith or you are driven by
[2:01:30] doubt amen
[2:01:31] praise the Lord
[2:01:33] but you will realize that
[2:01:40] when you look at uh uh uh
[2:01:46] your actions and your reactions
[2:01:49] when you are when when we are dealing
[2:01:51] with things
[2:01:53] just like I said it's easy for us to
[2:01:55] adjust our mind
[2:01:57] and that's why most of the time the
[2:01:59] Believers we try to do the word is
[2:02:02] preached we try to adjust our minds says
[2:02:05] what actually it is is that we are
[2:02:06] receiving the word by mental faith
[2:02:11] as we are adjusting our mind and
[2:02:13] adjusting that word to ourselves we are
[2:02:15] receiving the word by mental faith
[2:02:20] that's what he called the right mentored
[2:02:22] attitude
[2:02:23] so if we can keep that word in the right
[2:02:26] mental attitude then it will drop down
[2:02:30] and become
[2:02:31] a faith that can live through our body
[2:02:35] praise the Lord
[2:02:36] have you ever got to this place word you
[2:02:39] really thought you believe something you
[2:02:41] really thought you can stand it but then
[2:02:43] when it comes to the reality you back
[2:02:45] off
[2:02:46] because your faith is just in your mind
[2:02:51] it's just in your mind
[2:02:54] when it comes to standing for Christ and
[2:02:56] being a witness whether to order or to
[2:02:59] the devil we back off
[2:03:02] because that faith is not real yet
[2:03:10] are we together
[2:03:12] so the word of God sharper than the two
[2:03:15] ages sword is able to go that's the
[2:03:17] reason why the the prophet of God
[2:03:20] honored this sermon he can be able to go
[2:03:23] down into a person's subconscious
[2:03:26] and tell them this is the thing that is
[2:03:28] bothering you that is the thing this is
[2:03:31] the either that is creating an hindrance
[2:03:33] for you to receive your healing
[2:03:37] this is something that is buried in your
[2:03:40] spirit
[2:03:44] praise the Lord
[2:03:51] our age
[2:03:53] this age with its religious spirit you
[2:03:57] have to realize that this is a religious
[2:03:58] age there have never been an edge where
[2:04:01] there have been a bunch of preachers
[2:04:03] claiming Deliverance
[2:04:05] right
[2:04:08] in that oppressive streaming or just are
[2:04:11] speaking in tongue so that brings the is
[2:04:13] the word that brings Deliverance
[2:04:16] because it's the word that divides yes
[2:04:19] the word I identified
[2:04:27] are we together
[2:04:33] is the word that is able to help you to
[2:04:36] go back and say okay I see what this is
[2:04:39] right
[2:04:42] and the moment the words identify that
[2:04:44] that's your deliverance
[2:04:47] praise the Lord
[2:04:49] the moment the word Shines on it and
[2:04:51] identify that this is worthy of the
[2:04:53] source of your problem is
[2:04:56] that's your deliverance
[2:04:58] it is now now for you to walk in faith
[2:05:01] but you know that Old Devil is not going
[2:05:03] to let you go like that
[2:05:05] praise the Lord
[2:05:07] he will keep backing he's a dog backing
[2:05:09] with no teeth in his mouth
[2:05:13] if you just only listening to the
[2:05:15] loudness of his back you be afraid
[2:05:17] but if your faith is in God's word
[2:05:24] for he that the son has set free this
[2:05:26] freed indeed
[2:05:31] praise the Lord
[2:05:36] most of the things that brother Brandon
[2:05:37] will say is he says faith is a
[2:05:40] subconscious thing to the believer
[2:05:42] most of the things
[2:05:45] that uh we we deal with that I think I
[2:05:49] share that with you but
[2:05:52] I had a Grace and I was inspired to
[2:05:54] preach that last year uh in that
[2:05:57] convention in South Africa
[2:06:00] looking at what uh
[2:06:03] when the uh
[2:06:05] the scientists trying to uh what what
[2:06:08] they compare they compare with uh our
[2:06:13] subconscious they took that and and did
[2:06:16] a comparison with the Titanic
[2:06:21] there is a part of the shape that's you
[2:06:24] know up above the water
[2:06:27] that people can see the beauty the deck
[2:06:29] and all of that
[2:06:30] they said that that's our first
[2:06:32] conscious
[2:06:37] there is another part that goes deep
[2:06:39] down into the sea
[2:06:44] praise the Lord
[2:06:47] and that's our subconscious
[2:06:54] now so you see
[2:06:55] the word
[2:06:57] can be able
[2:06:59] you know when Birdman talking in in that
[2:07:02] message those indoors you know uh you
[2:07:06] know he picks up different things if you
[2:07:07] listen to all the different series he
[2:07:09] talks about different things you know
[2:07:11] those that we don't want to let Christ
[2:07:13] in
[2:07:15] praise the Lord
[2:07:18] and it's all because we are keeping
[2:07:20] something there and whatever it is I
[2:07:21] don't know what it is but whatever it is
[2:07:23] will be an idol
[2:07:27] and that thing will be causing
[2:07:30] us
[2:07:31] robbing us of walking
[2:07:33] in total freedom
[2:07:37] and victory in the word
[2:07:41] praise the Lord
[2:07:44] are we together
[2:07:47] now so uh that that was that was the
[2:07:50] portion of it you remember Wednesday
[2:07:51] night I mentioned that I said I would
[2:07:53] talk about it but I realized that did
[2:07:55] not have time to talk about it that was
[2:07:57] one of the portions that we left up on
[2:08:00] left left left off on Wednesday night so
[2:08:03] uh we see here
[2:08:06] that the uh the the Commandment of the
[2:08:10] Lord was uh love the Lord your God with
[2:08:13] all of your heart
[2:08:15] amen
[2:08:16] all of your soul
[2:08:19] out of your mind
[2:08:21] and all of your strength
[2:08:24] when you bring it to the aspect of this
[2:08:26] sermon
[2:08:28] okay you bring it to the aspect of
[2:08:31] discernment you realize sometimes that
[2:08:33] uh
[2:08:34] children of God do foolish things
[2:08:39] amen
[2:08:41] and they make foolish choices
[2:08:45] but what happened
[2:08:47] how do we judge those foolish choices
[2:08:50] when those things are done it's a wow if
[2:08:53] that person was a Believer they would
[2:08:54] not do that
[2:08:57] you know we just we just go take the gun
[2:08:59] shoot them
[2:09:01] if that person was a Believer oh my God
[2:09:03] they would not do that
[2:09:11] I praise the Lord
[2:09:15] amen
[2:09:17] you look through the scripture you look
[2:09:19] through the scriptures I mean yeah I
[2:09:21] mean even even when you that's that uh
[2:09:23] that scripture that we read on Solomon
[2:09:26] when you read from the beginning of the
[2:09:28] scripture
[2:09:30] now Solomon there with the king of of
[2:09:33] Egypt and Marina and and Egyptian
[2:09:36] daughter and yes God coming to him right
[2:09:39] after a few verses after
[2:09:45] and God is dealing with him
[2:09:49] praise the Lord
[2:09:53] you see that's the reason why a prophet
[2:09:55] will tell us you got to look at you got
[2:09:57] you got to go inside
[2:10:00] God is is the god of the inside of the
[2:10:04] inside
[2:10:05] he's he's in the Shekinah Glory
[2:10:08] praise the Lord all of this year that uh
[2:10:12] you know it's the path to the one that
[2:10:15] dwelleth in the Shekinah Glory
[2:10:19] praise the Lord
[2:10:22] because if if we don't understand those
[2:10:25] things we would we we would judge or
[2:10:28] understand the way that God deal with us
[2:10:30] by how we feel no
[2:10:34] praise the Lord
[2:10:36] because the same way you can feel
[2:10:38] disappointed and feel funny and feel
[2:10:40] tired the people in the world feel the
[2:10:42] same
[2:10:45] praise the Lord
[2:10:47] you can feel stress the people in the
[2:10:50] world feel the same
[2:10:53] but the one that dwelled in the inside
[2:10:56] of the inside the joy of the Lord is our
[2:10:59] strength
[2:11:01] when that joy of the Lord comes when he
[2:11:03] when his presence is made known he lift
[2:11:06] us up above our stress he left us up
[2:11:09] above our frustration
[2:11:15] praise the Lord
[2:11:21] so he's he's he's trying to help us he's
[2:11:24] teaching us to realize that the Innova
[2:11:28] uh he dwar not in Temple made with hands
[2:11:31] and bother with that prepare me
[2:11:46] we hear the common saying you know uh uh
[2:11:50] we you get to that place where you get
[2:11:53] that feeling you you write in the in the
[2:11:55] valley of decision it looks like you
[2:11:57] feel to do this and and and and
[2:11:59] sometimes we say the other Hearts say I
[2:12:02] shouldn't do it and then one heart say I
[2:12:04] should do it
[2:12:06] praise the Lord
[2:12:09] it's an it's an inner dealing
[2:12:13] praise the Lord
[2:12:15] you feel in a well to do something and
[2:12:18] there is something also that is
[2:12:19] restraining you from doing it
[2:12:23] glory be to God
[2:12:24] how do we find out
[2:12:26] how do we make the judgment to know
[2:12:28] which one is right
[2:12:31] who make the call
[2:12:35] praise the Lord
[2:12:36] that's when the world becomes
[2:12:39] the two edges swore the divides that's
[2:12:42] when the word becomes the one that
[2:12:44] identified what is right
[2:12:55] no Abraham told us that we are getting
[2:12:58] into a dark of day
[2:13:00] he told us that the decks are going to
[2:13:02] be die he told us that the Letters Out
[2:13:04] of Hell and demon powers are streaming
[2:13:07] into the Earth
[2:13:10] that's what he told us
[2:13:15] that's why we realize that we have a
[2:13:17] greater battle on our hands we are not
[2:13:19] on a picnic
[2:13:21] amen
[2:13:22] we are not on a picnic to come and you
[2:13:24] know we are telling ourselves how our
[2:13:26] dresses look nice and how you look cute
[2:13:28] and we are on the battlefield it's going
[2:13:30] to be bloody people it's going to be
[2:13:33] bloody if we don't understand how God is
[2:13:35] dealing with us it's going to be bloody
[2:13:37] because if the devil can put you in a
[2:13:40] confusion
[2:13:41] amen he can put you in a confusion and
[2:13:44] get you limited to just the things that
[2:13:47] are happening to your mind and the
[2:13:49] things that your body is going through
[2:13:50] and can never make you to identify what
[2:13:53] your heart is Desiring
[2:13:56] what your heart is Desiring
[2:14:04] praise the Lord
[2:14:09] that's the reason why the the the the
[2:14:11] laodicia church can just pump the people
[2:14:14] with music and make them happy
[2:14:17] make them happy we bring them no word no
[2:14:20] word just make them happy then the next
[2:14:23] thing we'll pray for the sake
[2:14:24] we'll bring we'll bring Deliverance
[2:14:27] bunch of confusion
[2:14:35] praise the Lord
[2:14:38] and you see while also that's the reason
[2:14:40] why people get bored with the message
[2:14:43] they get bored because the message is
[2:14:45] what word
[2:14:49] praise the Lord
[2:14:51] oh we we spend more time preaching than
[2:14:54] dancing
[2:14:55] we spend more time preaching than
[2:14:56] singing
[2:15:00] the word must have the preeminence
[2:15:04] amen the world must have the preeminence
[2:15:14] he must have the first place
[2:15:16] it is because of him that we are here
[2:15:19] he's the one that we must spend much
[2:15:21] time around
[2:15:24] because I'm telling you the world can
[2:15:26] create a better atmosphere than the
[2:15:28] music can
[2:15:35] are we together
[2:15:44] in the midst of all of our trials where
[2:15:46] do we find the strength
[2:15:49] to be in church
[2:15:53] where do we find a strength
[2:15:55] what is the thing that is driving us
[2:16:01] amen
[2:16:05] how do we even love the Lord with all of
[2:16:07] our strength
[2:16:09] how do we even love him with all of our
[2:16:11] strength
[2:16:12] how do we love him with our mind when
[2:16:14] this mind is just blasted by the devil
[2:16:21] but that's what his word says love the
[2:16:24] Lord with all of your mind
[2:16:26] out of your soul
[2:16:30] and all of your strength
[2:16:37] you love the Lord
[2:16:46] that's the reason why
[2:16:48] Christian Life is a high calling
[2:16:52] is the greatest responsibility
[2:16:57] that you can ever have
[2:17:03] Joseph never knew he never had an idea
[2:17:07] that when he fell in love with Mary God
[2:17:10] was calling him to a higher calling
[2:17:14] he thought he just had he just had a
[2:17:17] wife
[2:17:18] and he was going to uh
[2:17:21] uh you know uh
[2:17:23] I mean he lost his wife and now he have
[2:17:26] a new wife he's going to regain his life
[2:17:31] oh praise the Lord the Bible said Joseph
[2:17:32] was a just man
[2:17:35] amen
[2:17:36] he was a just man and God found a man
[2:17:40] the right kind of a man
[2:17:43] that will be able to stand as a manager
[2:17:45] because he was going to bring Christ
[2:17:48] through this virgin
[2:17:51] he never needed a man that would leave
[2:17:53] her in a time of Crisis or leave her in
[2:17:56] a time when the reproaches come
[2:18:00] and people started to say all sorts of
[2:18:01] things about uh a marriage
[2:18:06] her name was in the hairline
[2:18:10] praise the Lord Mary became the
[2:18:13] insulting word
[2:18:14] when people want to talk to their
[2:18:16] daughters don't be foolish like married
[2:18:22] but God kept Joseph in the time of his
[2:18:26] widowhole God prepared him
[2:18:28] because he was a just man he was a man
[2:18:31] that loved the Lord he was a man that
[2:18:33] sector seek the face of God that God
[2:18:36] could come down and tell Joseph fear not
[2:18:38] to take marriage the same angel that
[2:18:41] spoke to Mary was the same angel that
[2:18:43] came to Gabriel I mean came to Angel
[2:18:45] Gabriel came to Joseph and said fear not
[2:18:48] to take Mary as the wife
[2:18:53] for it was time like this
[2:18:57] that's why I raise you up
[2:19:00] praise the Lord
[2:19:02] amen
[2:19:06] so you can see
[2:19:09] now he's going to he's going to be the
[2:19:11] one there trying to manage to keep this
[2:19:13] Christ shy
[2:19:17] he's going to be a a supporter he's
[2:19:20] going to Bear the reproach
[2:19:27] praise the Lord
[2:19:31] the reason why God raised us up for this
[2:19:35] age and time like this
[2:19:38] it's not for loudisha competition
[2:19:42] God raise you up because he said there
[2:19:45] will be a bride in this age there will
[2:19:48] be a people that will stand for his name
[2:19:50] in this age
[2:19:51] praise the Lord
[2:19:54] amen and until we understand that until
[2:19:57] we understand how he's dealing with us
[2:20:04] what are we raised up for
[2:20:14] praise the Lord
[2:20:15] until we understand that
[2:20:21] the Bible says there was a there was a
[2:20:24] serpent a more daily serpent that just
[2:20:27] wrapped around the hand of Paul and and
[2:20:29] all the people were saying my God that
[2:20:31] God is he looks like a witch
[2:20:34] praise the Lord
[2:20:36] and scripture says it will not even
[2:20:38] bother him he just shake his hand and
[2:20:40] shake the serpent off
[2:20:42] and that's the same thing that we must
[2:20:43] do to Believers to the devil when he
[2:20:46] bring things to our mind and our body
[2:20:48] going through shake it off it does not
[2:20:50] have anything to do with what God is
[2:20:52] doing in your soul
[2:20:57] praise the Lord
[2:21:08] I fall in short of uh uh uh uh paying my
[2:21:11] bills what does what does that have to
[2:21:13] do with you being the son of God
[2:21:16] allow allow these your church will tell
[2:21:18] you about prosperity and and they're
[2:21:21] pushing all of those things into into
[2:21:23] the head of the people
[2:21:25] that's how they understand God
[2:21:28] they are not wrong they are they are
[2:21:30] operating under the influence of their
[2:21:32] age their age is Rich but it's also
[2:21:36] miserable it's also naked it's also
[2:21:39] blind
[2:21:42] because they can see and understand
[2:21:44] those things
[2:21:46] that he's in the chamber of your heart
[2:21:48] Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:21:53] praise the Lord the things that job they
[2:21:56] Now understand going through all his
[2:21:59] trial you understand it
[2:22:04] praise the Lord
[2:22:06] amen and even though he did not
[2:22:09] understand it he never stayed Curse God
[2:22:11] because God was holy name
[2:22:15] he's the stronghold of our life
[2:22:20] praise the Lord
[2:22:23] Solomon wanted to understand everything
[2:22:25] and he did not even understand how he
[2:22:27] entered in adultery
[2:22:29] or idolatry
[2:22:32] he wanted to understand all everything
[2:22:34] under the sun
[2:22:37] but that was not David desire
[2:22:39] he said one thing hafa desired of the
[2:22:41] Lord
[2:22:43] and that I would seek after no matter
[2:22:44] what I'm going through I will seek after
[2:22:46] that
[2:22:47] I should do it in the house of the Lord
[2:22:50] all the days of my life
[2:22:55] praise the Lord
[2:22:59] I should do it in the house of the Lord
[2:23:06] unless we learn
[2:23:08] to start applying this word
[2:23:12] or as unless we learn to take this word
[2:23:15] this this was the word
[2:23:16] that created everything in the beginning
[2:23:22] Hebrew says everything the heaven and
[2:23:24] Herb Earth is hell by the word
[2:23:29] until we learn to start taking the word
[2:23:33] and applying the word
[2:23:37] do you realize how miserable we have
[2:23:40] been
[2:23:41] to be able to to to to produce a church
[2:23:45] with decent said produce a church
[2:23:48] with holiness
[2:23:50] you know how miserable we have been
[2:23:56] when we started lying our our children
[2:23:59] five says yes or less fast for everybody
[2:24:02] on hunger strike
[2:24:04] because we want to see the glory of the
[2:24:06] Lord
[2:24:07] when those innocent children
[2:24:09] just exposed to Spirits
[2:24:16] because we are Pentecostal we want to
[2:24:17] see the glory we want to see the power
[2:24:19] of God even the children have to fast
[2:24:22] you know how miserable we have been
[2:24:27] you know how many evil spirits will be
[2:24:29] packing
[2:24:31] um
[2:24:32] you are not safe from it
[2:24:38] you are not making the world your
[2:24:40] shelter
[2:24:42] if you are not making this world your
[2:24:45] shelter
[2:24:46] you are not safe
[2:24:50] from the spirits that are loose in the
[2:24:52] Earth
[2:24:57] the prophet of God said rock and roll is
[2:24:59] preparing the minds of our young people
[2:25:02] preparing their man for the blast
[2:25:07] and we see all that rock and roll
[2:25:09] infiltrating into gospel music and all
[2:25:11] of that
[2:25:15] just because they say Jesus
[2:25:18] look at the spirit that is behind it
[2:25:21] amen
[2:25:22] and even sometimes you want to be
[2:25:24] comfortable go and low cut look at the
[2:25:27] character that is singing that song pull
[2:25:29] them up look at the address code
[2:25:35] that's somebody that have all the all
[2:25:37] their body part peers
[2:25:39] yeah I want to sing it for entertainment
[2:25:42] that's all they are singing for make
[2:25:44] their money
[2:25:46] and live your life in a place of
[2:25:48] confusion
[2:25:52] praise the Lord
[2:25:57] because sometimes the god that they are
[2:25:59] singing to
[2:26:01] is not the god that you worship
[2:26:05] praise the Lord
[2:26:06] is not the god that you worship
[2:26:09] it's easy for them to say God
[2:26:12] it's difficult for them to see Jesus
[2:26:19] it's easy for them to say God because
[2:26:20] anything is God
[2:26:29] I'm not making this word
[2:26:33] your shelter
[2:26:37] if you are not feeding On the Border
[2:26:39] word of the son of man
[2:26:42] that's the only word that gives us
[2:26:44] Rapture in faith
[2:26:53] are we together
[2:26:57] you understood what I came from this
[2:26:59] morning
[2:27:00] praise the Lord
[2:27:04] we were not rightly discerned the body
[2:27:07] of the Lord
[2:27:10] because let's let things be happening in
[2:27:13] the church
[2:27:15] sometimes Lord God take his church
[2:27:17] through trials
[2:27:19] praise the Lord
[2:27:22] and people just sit back there and says
[2:27:24] well I mean there's nothing happening in
[2:27:25] that church
[2:27:27] sometimes the church goes through the
[2:27:29] the four the four anointings
[2:27:32] that time where the church fly hide Like
[2:27:34] an Eagle Revelation is breaking forth in
[2:27:37] the church God is blessing them with
[2:27:39] gifts the power of God is a monitor
[2:27:41] sometimes God will take his church
[2:27:42] through
[2:27:44] the ox
[2:27:47] where people will be having different
[2:27:48] trials and different sickness and
[2:27:50] different things
[2:27:52] when those Believers were dying giving
[2:27:55] themselves to die into the state God
[2:27:57] will stay with them
[2:27:58] God will stay God
[2:28:00] it was God that was giving them the
[2:28:03] grace for them to give their body to be
[2:28:05] burned
[2:28:10] sometimes God will take his church
[2:28:12] through immense anointing word the
[2:28:14] church will be taught on different
[2:28:15] doctrines and different things how to
[2:28:17] prepare themselves
[2:28:24] but because we have a poor discernment
[2:28:27] of the church Paul discernment of the
[2:28:29] body of the Lord
[2:28:31] I kept you too long then I then I
[2:28:33] thought I would have
[2:28:34] let the musicians come
[2:28:38] that's that's what always happened you
[2:28:40] try to do review then you preach more
[2:28:42] than you are doing reviewing
[2:28:45] all right he says let me just review all
[2:28:47] my subjects just make one point then you
[2:28:49] end up preaching seven different
[2:28:50] messages
[2:28:52] praise the Lord
[2:28:54] but I just wanted to grab from Wednesday
[2:28:56] night
[2:28:58] we were talking about uh the seventh
[2:29:00] spirit before the Lord and it brought us
[2:29:04] over to the Tabernacle the temple and I
[2:29:06] thought that I should just wrap the
[2:29:08] whole thing about what I wanted to make
[2:29:11] my emphasis on was uh uh those those
[2:29:14] just just understanding how God is
[2:29:17] dealing with us in this age
[2:29:20] praise the Lord
[2:29:22] just understanding how God is dealing
[2:29:24] with us
[2:29:26] is the word
[2:29:27] that is changing us
[2:29:29] is the word that is fighting our battles
[2:29:33] is the word that is keeping those evil
[2:29:35] spirits out
[2:29:37] you can deal with this age
[2:29:40] with your human understanding
[2:29:43] no matter how how advised you are in
[2:29:46] technology technology don't deal with
[2:29:48] spirits
[2:29:52] technology don't keep Spirits away
[2:29:55] [Music]
[2:30:06] [Music]
[2:30:10] praise the Lord
[2:30:13] [Music]
[2:30:17] let me say this and then I will close
[2:30:21] Moses said love the Lord with all of
[2:30:24] your heart
[2:30:25] all of your soul out of your mind
[2:30:32] [Music]
[2:30:36] but daily
[2:30:38] was led by the Holy Spirit last week and
[2:30:40] he was preaching and he was dealing with
[2:30:43] a family relationship husband and wife
[2:30:46] and he was dealing with all of that
[2:30:49] and he got to that place and talking
[2:30:51] about man love your wife
[2:30:54] woman reference your husband
[2:30:59] what I want for us to realize is that
[2:31:01] those things are not just laws and
[2:31:03] commandment of God those are things of
[2:31:05] God himself that he gives to us
[2:31:08] you will realize that love goes with
[2:31:11] worship
[2:31:11] [Music]
[2:31:14] love and worship goes together
[2:31:18] praise the Lord
[2:31:19] that's the reason why you cannot say
[2:31:21] that you love God
[2:31:25] and you are now worshiping him
[2:31:28] I mean worshiping him is not just your
[2:31:30] attendance in church no worship is more
[2:31:33] than that
[2:31:36] it's more than that worship is what you
[2:31:39] acknowledge
[2:31:41] amen
[2:31:43] is the most dominant thing on your mind
[2:31:49] foreign
[2:31:59] love the Lord
[2:32:00] [Music]
[2:32:04] fall in love with him Embrace his word
[2:32:08] [Music]
[2:32:11] even when his word is against
[2:32:14] [Music]
[2:32:16] your nature his word is against
[2:32:19] something you're struggling with love
[2:32:21] his word stay
[2:32:24] [Music]
[2:32:30] s the Lord
[2:32:33] because if you love God and you love his
[2:32:35] word Lord I love your word your word is
[2:32:37] truth
[2:32:39] speak to me Reveal Your word to me Thy
[2:32:43] word that word brings you into worship

[2:32:48] you to a life of surrounding you don't
[2:32:51] have to struggle with it
[2:32:54] he says my burden I lighter

[2:37:18] no you you you will not be able to get
[2:37:21] this down
[2:37:23] that area of your life
[2:37:25] [Music]
[2:37:32] if it is honor the love of God
[2:37:35] the Bible says the love of God is spread

[2:37:43] it affects all those area
[2:37:46] he knows how to give us strength
[2:37:50] for the next day
[2:37:55] he knows how to deal with the talks and
[2:37:57] the warrior and the stress of our mind
[2:38:03] the word knows how to go in their Spirit
[2:38:05] reign of you
[2:38:06] [Music]
[2:38:09] he knows how to order your dreams he
[2:38:12] knows how to go there in your
[2:38:13] subconscious
[2:38:16] and deal with things
[2:38:20] that could be fearful that could be
[2:38:22] scary
[2:38:24] things that you don't want to talk about
[2:38:26] you don't want to think about it you
[2:38:28] don't want to remember it but because
[2:38:30] you are a human you can't forget
[2:38:34] but the word knows how to go down there
[2:38:38] and he can be able to pick those things
[2:38:40] up
[2:38:42] and sometimes the word will give you a
[2:38:45] consolation
[2:38:49] he will help you to understand and make
[2:38:52] you to realize For a Moment Like This
[2:38:55] For a Moment Like This for a day like
[2:38:58] this
[2:39:01] that's the reason why
[2:39:06] oh there is nothing about the word
[2:39:12] oh Father we just love you

[2:39:26] I got caught up with this on my mind all
[2:39:28] through the night and just saying Lord

[2:39:57] to realize who God
[2:40:02] that you are that God that that looks on
[2:40:04] us from the outward Lord

[2:40:14] will he wouldn't have chosen that
[2:40:16] Shepherd boy

[2:40:20] George from the outward appearance
[2:40:24] we might be small in numbers we might be
[2:40:27] uh
[2:40:28] people that are not like uh this this
[2:40:31] world but father you look at the inward
[2:40:34] you look at the word that you have given
[2:40:36] us Lord father the mystery of God that
[2:40:39] being revealed law the opening of the
