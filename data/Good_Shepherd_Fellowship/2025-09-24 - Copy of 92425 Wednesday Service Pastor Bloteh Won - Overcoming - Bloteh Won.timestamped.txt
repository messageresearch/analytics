[29:45] for the accuser of the brethren is cast
[29:48] down, which accusth them before our God
[29:52] day and night."
[29:55] And they overcame him by the blood of
[29:58] the lamb and by the word of their
[30:02] testimony
[30:04] &gt;&gt; and they love not their lives unto
[30:07] death. Amen.

[31:47] tonight and uh uh I want to labor a
[31:51] little bit on on overcomers. Overcomer
[31:54] overcoming. Brother Brandon preached a
[31:56] message uh uh what it takes to overcome
[32:01] all unbelief. He said is our faith. He
[32:04] says uh uh that's what it takes to
[32:06] overcome all unbelief. Then he also
[32:10] preached the message how can I overcome.
[32:13] Now so this evening I just want to uh uh
[32:17] as as I trust that the Lord will be able
[32:19] to help. We want to just uh uh uh be
[32:22] able to go in that direction tonight a
[32:26] little bit. I just want to show you
[32:27] something and uh uh I pray that it be is
[32:31] a blessing to you. Amen. Amen. I pray
[32:34] that it's a blessing to you. Now, uh,
[32:38] uh, Manuel, if you can put my image up,
[32:40] uh, please bring my pointer.
[32:43] Amen. Bring my pointer.
[32:46] It's 8:15.
[32:52] I have 45 minutes to preach. If I can
[32:56] become a successful preacher, successful
[32:59] preacher preach in 45 minutes. Amen.
[33:02] never been successful.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:12] Brother Brandon committed brother
[33:14] Neville and uh he said he he brother
[33:17] Brandon was never a successful preacher
[33:19] because he couldn't preach in 45
[33:21] minutes. When you listen to some of
[33:22] brother Neville messages, he was able to
[33:25] just stay around the circumference of 45
[33:28] 50 and all of that there. Can you put my
[33:31] image up? Are we able to
[33:34] in the second?
[33:38] If you go down, is that part of it?
[33:43] It just gave you a link.
[33:47] What have I done?
[33:50] What in the world have I done?
[33:53] Praise the Lord. Let me let me just see
[33:56] here.
[34:00] This is something that we have used
[34:02] before uh Emmanuel. So uh it should be
[34:06] in our
[34:13] Oh, I see what happened here.
[34:20] I see what happened here.
[34:24] Let me try this again.
[34:31] Let me try again. See if
[34:34] when I look in my
[34:38] I look in my
[34:54] Okay.
[34:56] We will still we can still refer to
[34:59] that. Uh
[35:04] let's see exactly what's what's going
[35:06] on.
[35:09] So yeah, uh
[35:15] when we uh when you if you remember, we
[35:19] were talking uh uh one time and I was
[35:22] showing you those images that I said I
[35:26] will come back to
[35:28] and uh the one that had
[35:32] the the
[35:37] it had the
[35:41] Okay, man. I've just sent that again.
[35:43] So, I hope it went uh
[35:51] Okay. Yeah, I think you should have it
[35:53] now.
[35:55] You'll soon remember the the one with
[35:57] the paramed and then it had the the the
[35:59] the
[36:01] red the
[36:04] the beast on one side and then the
[36:07] living creatures on the other side.
[36:09] That's what I'm trying to refer to
[36:11] tonight. Praise the Lord.
[36:14] Now, so uh uh when you when you look at
[36:19] that image,
[36:21] uh
[36:23] we uh
[36:29] we were trying to uh you bring it up.
[36:32] Just just pay attention to me. Let's
[36:34] let's just read uh let's let's just read
[36:36] an introduction here. Okay, I think you
[36:38] got it. Let's just read an introduction
[36:40] here and see what brother Brandham said
[36:42] in the message. How can I overcome? He
[36:45] said this. He said, now I choose this
[36:48] because that I think that is a time that
[36:51] we should never let the spirit of
[36:54] revival die. Amen. He said we must never
[36:57] let the spirit of revival die. So which
[37:00] mean in a sense that we have to
[37:02] overcome. Now you have to remember the
[37:04] subject he's teaching us here is how we
[37:07] can overcome. It does not matter what
[37:10] you have to overcome. It's how you
[37:13] overcome it. Amen.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The devil can come in
[37:17] in in every way. I mean, he he's just
[37:20] changing his max, but he will always
[37:22] come the same way he have ever come.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will always come the same way
[37:29] he have ever come. So no matter how he
[37:31] come, if you know uh how to overcome,
[37:35] you will overcome him everywhere, any
[37:38] time, under any condition, any disguise,
[37:42] you will overcome the devil.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord if you know how to
[37:46] overcome. Now uh uh uh as in uh uh
[37:50] Matthew chapter 4, brother Brandon will
[37:53] let us know that Jesus overcame the
[37:55] devil by saying, "It is written." Amen.
[37:58] He overcame the devil by pointing to the
[38:01] word.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[38:05] &gt;&gt; He overcame the devil by pointing to the
[38:07] word and say it is written. And Satan
[38:09] comes back also and say it is also
[38:12] written.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will give his angels charge
[38:15] over you. So I mean he's challenging the
[38:17] Lord with uh but let's look into the
[38:21] church ages and see how how did we
[38:24] overcame? How how are we overcoming?
[38:27] Because what I'm going to show you is
[38:29] not something that uh uh we we we we are
[38:34] learning to do. It's something that we
[38:36] are already doing.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; It's something that we are already doing
[38:42] because uh the way we overcame over the
[38:46] in the church ages uh is play out in
[38:50] symbols.
[38:52] In the church ages is play out in
[38:54] symbol. But we are living the reality.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to show you
[39:02] tonight. Let's uh throw my image up,
[39:04] please.
[39:07] Amen.
[39:09] So yeah, this is this is what I wanted
[39:10] to show you. I told you that we will
[39:13] come back to this. There there's a whole
[39:14] lot that is around here that I want for
[39:17] us to to to deal with a little bit.
[39:19] Amen. Last Wednesday we read from the
[39:22] book of uh Ephesians uh uh uh Paul says
[39:26] the weapons of our warfare are not
[39:29] cannon. He says we are not fighting
[39:31] against flesh and blood but we are
[39:33] fighting against principalities and
[39:36] spiritual wickedness in high places. So
[39:39] this dark image here is is is an evil
[39:42] power is is a is a is a is a is is a
[39:47] representation of the of of from the
[39:50] bottomless pit. It's a representation of
[39:53] uh a a a a dark smoke uh uh uh you know
[39:57] that is coming out of the bottomless
[39:59] pit.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Now you you'll see that over and over in
[40:03] uh in the prayer line. Brother Brham
[40:05] will always identify demon power as a
[40:08] dark shadow. He says, "I see a dark
[40:10] shadow hanging over you." Amen. I have
[40:13] one of those picture in my in my office.
[40:15] I printed it for the reason. I will use
[40:17] it when when it's time now. So, so this
[40:21] is a a dark shadow representing the evil
[40:25] power, representing demon powers that is
[40:28] streaming out of hell uh to attack the
[40:31] church. Now, you have to remember this.
[40:34] Now, this is a representation of the
[40:37] church
[40:39] because
[40:40] when the image that Daniel saw was hit
[40:44] in the legs, when it fell, the Bible
[40:47] says a great mountain
[40:49] &gt;&gt; grew up to that place.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; So that great mountain was the church.
[40:58] The image was representing the political
[41:01] powers.
[41:03] It was representing Babylon, the head of
[41:07] gold and and and and the m and so all
[41:11] the political powers that was going to
[41:14] be ruling the ages uh uh the gentile
[41:17] kingdom was represented in that image
[41:20] that Daniel saw. But when the stone hit
[41:24] the image in his foot, the Bible says a
[41:27] a mountain grew. Yeah. Now so if you go
[41:31] to Christ in is revealed in his own word
[41:34] that's what brother Brandham says God
[41:36] started building his church from the
[41:38] from the feet up
[41:41] because in the feet age which was the
[41:43] first church age that was where great
[41:45] missionary work is done. He said when it
[41:49] came to the Pentecostal age it was the
[41:51] tongue age. So God gave them the gift of
[41:54] tongue. He says when you get to the
[41:56] tongue that is the mouth next to the
[41:59] tongue is the intelligence.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; It's the intelligence. So we are in the
[42:08] age of the intelligence. Praise the
[42:10] Lord. We will get to all of that. But
[42:13] this is where we want to work. I'm just
[42:15] I'm just trying to bring you into the
[42:16] picture of what I want to talk about
[42:18] tonight. So this this image represent
[42:20] the church. Are we together? M
[42:24] &gt;&gt; and uh uh uh all of this will represent
[42:28] each age of the church. We will we will
[42:32] get there.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] So uh uh uh but tonight we we we we want
[42:44] to look at what uh brother Brandon
[42:49] telling us here is that the reason why
[42:51] he said he taught this subject about
[42:54] overcoming is so we can know how to keep
[42:57] the spirit of revival.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; How to keep the spirit of revival. He
[43:03] says that it will never the spirit of
[43:05] revival will not die. We have got to
[43:07] keep in revival constantly.
[43:11] We have to keep in revival constantly
[43:14] revive
[43:16] every day. Paul say I I had to die daily
[43:20] that Christ should you live
[43:24] and we must never let that revival die
[43:29] in us.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the church revival.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; The revival must never die in us.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can have a lot going on
[43:48] around us, but the revival, the revival
[43:52] of the word must never die in us.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We must never let the spirit of
[44:02] revival die.
[44:04] He says here,
[44:08] we find here that God has always had
[44:12] overcomers.
[44:14] Praise the Lord.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; God has always have overcomers.
[44:20] He had overcomers in every age. So in
[44:24] the seven church ages, we will read he
[44:28] that overcome.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:33] He that overcome. Now you have to
[44:36] remember now you go back there. I mean
[44:39] my Bible is open here. So let me be let
[44:41] me be very clear before I I say
[44:44] something there uh uh that I shouldn't
[44:48] say. Praise the Lord.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; You go right over
[44:54] uh to the to the first church ages. The
[44:57] first church age. Sorry. And uh uh uh
[45:01] the Bible says, "He that have an ear,
[45:03] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[45:05] the church, to him that overcometh."
[45:09] Now uh uh I'm I'm repeating this because
[45:14] it is not saying to him that will
[45:17] overcome.
[45:20] It's saying to him that overcometh.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Because
[45:25] the overcoming is already done.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[45:30] Amen. That's why Jesus said, "Be of a
[45:34] good chill
[45:35] &gt;&gt; because I have overcome the word."
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "Be of a good chill." Rejoice.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Rejoice. So, so what we're doing is that
[45:51] as believers when when we recognize the
[45:54] word, we recognize the message of our
[45:57] age and we come and receive the message,
[46:00] what we're doing is that we are
[46:02] rejoicing in his overcoming.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; We are identifying with his overcoming.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you can you can think about
[46:20] the quote brother Brad Brand who says,
[46:22] "Oh yeah, you know, God is not going to
[46:24] bring you through a tube and and take
[46:26] you on the other side and says he that
[46:28] overcome the word, you have something to
[46:30] overcome." All of that is truth. All of
[46:32] that is the word. But the the truth
[46:34] about the matter there is that is him
[46:37] that overcome it.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't care how hard
[46:44] you try.
[46:46] If you are not having a good chill, if
[46:48] you are not rejoicing that he has
[46:51] overcometh overcome the word, you are
[46:54] not going to overcome.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh uh
[47:04] uh he says uh we we have had overcomers
[47:08] in every age. Uh there always been every
[47:11] time in every age that there has been on
[47:14] earth, God has God has always have
[47:18] somebody he could put his hands on.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody he could put his hands on. And
[47:27] you know what he's doing? He's putting
[47:30] his hands on me and you and picking us
[47:34] by the collar
[47:35] &gt;&gt; and lifting us up. Amen.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; He's putting us, grabbing us by the
[47:44] collar
[47:45] &gt;&gt; and putting us over all the trials, all
[47:51] &gt;&gt; you know, I've overcome the word.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; He's taking us over all the cosmos of
[47:56] the world.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; You know what? If I remind you that if
[48:04] we will make it, it has to be all in
[48:06] him.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; You have to grow in a faith where you
[48:10] know that all is in him.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; It is him that have done it.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; So that's what I'm trying to bring you
[48:20] here tonight. So he says here, God has
[48:23] always have somebody he could put his
[48:24] hand on as a witness in the earth. He
[48:27] never has been without a witness.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. No matter how bad the age is,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; no matter how polluted, how sinful, how
[48:37] backsliding the people are, God will
[48:40] always have a witness.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; There will always be somebody God will
[48:46] raise up in that generation
[48:48] &gt;&gt; as someone that believe his word,
[48:51] somebody that fully trusted in him.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; He has never been without a witness.
[49:03] Though sometime just one
[49:06] &gt;&gt; but somebody overcome.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody overcome.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Are you feeling like an overcomer
[49:17] tonight?
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't feel like it, you have to
[49:22] believe it.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Believe it until you start to feel like
[49:27] it. Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh he said this. I'm going to
[49:34] use this as my principle that I want to
[49:36] use to go into what I'm what I want to
[49:39] go into to again he says in the message
[49:41] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[49:44] our faith. He says, "Now
[49:48] all redemptive blessing
[49:51] to us,
[49:53] the human race, was paid for for us at
[49:57] Calvary."
[49:59] When Jesus died for us, he said it was
[50:03] finished. Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "God paid for every
[50:08] redemptive blessing. Whatever you will
[50:10] enjoy
[50:12] in this life
[50:15] in your body, in your your health, in
[50:18] your faith, whatever you will enjoy. It
[50:22] will not you will not enjoy it because
[50:24] you have a better preacher that now
[50:26] makes the message simple to you. You
[50:29] will not enjoy it because your life
[50:31] status has changed. You will enjoy it
[50:34] because it was paid for.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was paid for at Calvary.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now he says that it was h
[50:47] when when when when he when Jesus died
[50:50] for us, we believe
[50:53] that the works and the complete plan of
[50:57] God.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Every redemptive blessing was completed
[51:03] at Calvary. Do you believe that?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Let it be your confession tonight. Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; We believe that the works and the
[51:15] complete plan of redemption, every
[51:17] redemptive blessing was completed at
[51:19] Calvary. That all of God's promises was
[51:24] made possible. Everything that God
[51:27] promised when from from Genesis 1, every
[51:30] seed will bring forth of his kind, it
[51:33] was made possible.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Because of Calvary.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; The seed of the woman will bruise the
[51:43] head of the serpent was made possible
[51:46] because of Calvary.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Every promises. Now
[51:53] follow me now. You got to follow me. He
[51:56] says every promises
[51:58] all that all of God's promises was made
[52:02] possible to every human being that will
[52:06] accept it.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; When
[52:11] are we together?
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Are we accepting? When Jesus died to
[52:17] clear the human before God at Calvary, I
[52:22] believe that every man
[52:27] I believe that every man in the world
[52:30] was saved when Jesus died at Calvary.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Every sick person in the world was
[52:37] healed.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; When Jesus died at Calvary.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; But now it's a finished work.
[52:48] Now, the thing to do is,
[52:52] can we get the people to see it?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; It's already done, but can we get the
[52:59] people
[53:00] &gt;&gt; to see it?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; And accept it.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6.
[53:14] Revelation chapter 6.
[53:22] Are we together?
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Put Put the image back up for me,
[53:30] Emmanuel. Thank you. Revelation chapter
[53:33] 6. We read from verse one. Let the image
[53:36] stay up and uh I will do the reading.
[53:39] And I saw
[53:43] when the lamb opened one of the seal,
[53:48] and I heard
[53:50] as it was a noise of thunder,
[53:54] and one of the four beasts,
[53:59] which is one of these,
[54:01] one of these of the four beasts is
[54:04] supposed to be uh the living creatures,
[54:06] but one of these four beasts
[54:10] Are we together?
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; One of the four beasts saying,
[54:17] "Come and what?"
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the four beasts saying, "I
[54:24] want you to tell me what the four bees
[54:26] is saying." One of the four be saying,
[54:30] &gt;&gt; "Come and see." I want you to say it.
[54:32] One of the four B saying,
[54:34] &gt;&gt; "Come and see. come and see because
[54:37] that's where we are tonight. Now
[54:39] remember now remember to Brandham says
[54:42] everything was already paid for.
[54:46] Everything is a finished work. But if we
[54:50] can only get the people to do what?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; To see it.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; To see it.
[55:02] Amen. Now, so I'm I'm trying to show
[55:06] show you how we overcame how how we
[55:09] overcome.
[55:12] How we overcome. What's the principle?
[55:15] That's what I'm trying to show you
[55:16] tonight. I don't want it to go over your
[55:18] head. Now, let's let's read on a little
[55:20] bit. I'll come back. One of the four be
[55:22] saying, "Come and see. And I saw and
[55:25] behold a white horse." This is this this
[55:28] one now. Amen. I saw a white horse,
[55:33] and he that sat on him had a bow, and a
[55:38] crown was given unto him, and he went
[55:42] forth conquering
[55:45] and to conquer. Now when this evil power
[55:51] was go was was was traveling
[55:54] and trying to conquer the church it
[55:57] first started by arresting Peter and
[56:00] John and then they whipped them in the
[56:02] public place they said never speak in
[56:04] the name of Jesus Christ.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Then it went down again to grab John and
[56:11] they killed him and it went down again.
[56:15] Uh so this evil power was moving. It was
[56:17] it was conquering little by little. We
[56:19] talk about the church of Thessalonica
[56:21] coming under persecution. It was it was
[56:24] all under this this uh h white house
[56:28] that was that was that was that was you
[56:30] know taking up his heels and beginning
[56:31] to run.
[56:33] Now listen now
[56:36] how do we overcome?
[56:39] The Bible says here, one of the four
[56:42] beasts,
[56:44] which is the anointing that was in that
[56:48] age.
[56:49] Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; And the anointing was the move of God.
[56:55] The anointing was the power of God.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh
[57:07] praise the Lord. Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go back again to uh Revelation
[57:13] 6:1. Don't change the image, leave the
[57:15] image up. Praise the Lord. You can write
[57:17] it down and read it. The Bible says,
[57:19] "And
[57:21] and I saw when the L Now, so there is
[57:25] there is uh there is there is uh another
[57:29] uh uh uh
[57:32] another player. Let me let me say it
[57:34] like that. Another person in the whole
[57:36] strip." Yeah. is the lamb.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; When the lamb opened the book,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; So, here we have
[57:48] one of the four beats. Here we have the
[57:53] white
[57:55] &gt;&gt; the white house. Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; With bow and no arrow.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; We have the
[58:04] &gt;&gt; beast.
[58:06] Amen.
[58:07] But
[58:10] before we saw the beast,
[58:13] before we saw the white house,
[58:15] &gt;&gt; okay,
[58:15] &gt;&gt; what do we see?
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. John said, "When I
[58:22] saw the lamb,
[58:25] &gt;&gt; are we together?"
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; When I saw the lamb, who is the lamb?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; The one that say, "I have overcome the
[58:35] world."
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. be of a good chair.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; He is the lamb of God.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; The first person you must see is who?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; The lamb.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; That's that is the that is the guy that
[58:51] is that is particular and major in the
[58:53] whole thing. It's not the it's not the
[58:56] beast.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; It's not the living creature. It's not
[58:59] the anointing. It's not the the the the
[59:02] white horse the bow and no arrow. The
[59:05] first person you should see when John
[59:08] introduced he said and I saw the lamb.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb?
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb in your trials?
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb with things that
[59:22] are happening around you? Or are you
[59:25] seeing the devil power? Or are you
[59:28] seeing the anointing which is maybe we
[59:31] go to church, I feel good, I feel the
[59:33] presence of God. But are you seeing the
[59:35] land?
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; How to overcome?
[59:43] &gt;&gt; How to overcome?
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever you are dealing with, the first
[59:48] thing how to overcome.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; The first thing you must see is the
[59:53] lamb.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; John said, "And I saw the lamb.
[1:00:05] Amen.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; What did the lamb do? Open.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; The lamb open. So it is what the lamb
[1:00:17] open that is now going to show us what
[1:00:21] is happening.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And until the lamb open your eyes, you
[1:00:29] will never see what is happening.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; You will never see what God what God is
[1:00:35] doing in your life or why God is alive.
[1:00:38] You will not see it.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said they have eyes but they
[1:00:44] can't see.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the lamp did not open.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; How to overcome.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; How to keep the revival.
[1:00:58] I saw the lamb
[1:01:00] open.
[1:01:02] one of the seals.
[1:01:04] Amen.
[1:01:08] And I heard as it was a noise of
[1:01:12] thunder.
[1:01:14] All of those are are beautiful. We can
[1:01:17] get in there and start to and start to
[1:01:20] What is the thunder? The thunder is a
[1:01:21] voice of God. We can get in there and
[1:01:23] start and start and start uh you know
[1:01:26] getting into all of that. But what I
[1:01:28] want to get to you tonight is this. I
[1:01:30] heard as it were a noise of a thunder,
[1:01:33] one of the four beasts.
[1:01:36] Now, so when the lamb open,
[1:01:40] Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; I'm the one preaching tonight. I
[1:01:44] represent the lamb.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; When the lamb open,
[1:01:50] this is the book that was healed. This
[1:01:52] is the book of redemption. When the lamb
[1:01:55] open,
[1:01:57] praise the Lord.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. From out of this book,
[1:02:01] we heard a noise of thunder.
[1:02:05] We heard the voice of God. And the voice
[1:02:07] of God is the voice of the lamb.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; The voice of God is the voice of the
[1:02:15] lamb.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; And when you hear that voice, what did
[1:02:19] the voice say?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:02:25] The voice call to you
[1:02:28] particular. Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; I broke this thing. Okay, fine. I got it
[1:02:33] right. The voice call to you. Come and
[1:02:37] see.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to remember
[1:02:46] in in in in St. John chapter one,
[1:02:49] brother Brandham always talked about
[1:02:51] Nata and Phillip.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:55] Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; He went to call his friend and what did
[1:02:59] he say?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; That come and see is always the voice of
[1:03:09] the lamb.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; When the woman at the well
[1:03:24] When Jesus said, "I give you water, you
[1:03:28] drink, you never come here yet again."
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; She said, "I perceive that you are a
[1:03:34] prophet."
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; But when the Messiah come and he says,
[1:03:37] "I am he."
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; When she went, what did she say?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Come and see. Why? Because the lamb was
[1:03:46] identified.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; When he said, "I am he." Revelation 6:1
[1:03:51] was open.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; The lamb was identified. And every time
[1:03:56] the lamb is identified, you hear the
[1:03:59] voice come and see.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Every time the lamb is identified, every
[1:04:09] time the book is open, that is the
[1:04:12] reason why when a person gets saved, I
[1:04:15] mean uh h a joy is in your heart. I mean
[1:04:19] you you have seen something it's so easy
[1:04:21] for you to say oh come you know you can
[1:04:23] invite somebody to it becomes so easy
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; why because you have seen the land
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; at that time you don't know you don't
[1:04:34] know the doctrine of the church you
[1:04:35] don't know that this church they can be
[1:04:37] critical this church they can be that
[1:04:39] you don't know all of that
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; when you sit down you become so relaxed
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; when you start sleeping in church that
[1:04:47] when you can see all the church
[1:04:48] probably.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; But when you are first saved, you are on
[1:04:56] fire. You just I like I I just love to
[1:04:59] be in church.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Because what is happening? You have
[1:05:05] hearing the voice of the lamb. Come and
[1:05:07] see.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] When I when I uh when I saw the lamb
[1:05:19] open one of the seal, I heard and it was
[1:05:22] like the noise of thunder. One of the
[1:05:25] four beast saying, "Come and see."
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; So it is the lamb.
[1:05:38] Maybe I I'll have to I'll have to maybe
[1:05:40] the next time I'm talking talking on
[1:05:43] this I will have to I'll have to add to
[1:05:45] the image. I'll have to put the lamb. So
[1:05:48] it's the lamb
[1:05:50] seeing
[1:05:52] to
[1:05:54] the beast
[1:05:56] come and see.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; So the lamb is exposing this.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; The land is exposing
[1:06:13] the power, the spirit that is waring
[1:06:15] against the church.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; The spirit that is waring against our
[1:06:20] life.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; The lamb is saying, "Come and see.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Come look over here and see."
[1:06:35] Brother says, "We overcome by knowing
[1:06:37] the devil in all of his tricks."
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; How do you know the devil in all of his
[1:06:41] traits?
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; This man that brought David down, he
[1:06:46] brought Solomon, I mean Solomon, he
[1:06:48] brought Samson, the strongest man down.
[1:06:50] How can you know the devil in all of his
[1:06:52] tricks? You got to hide behind this
[1:06:54] anointing.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That's the reason why
[1:06:58] in every age, God raised up an anointing
[1:07:00] to lead his people.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; In every age, there is an anointing.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; We are sheeps. We don't lead ourself.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; We stay under a shepherd.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; We stay under an anointing. So the
[1:07:19] anointing that now lead the church to
[1:07:23] see the working of the devil in their
[1:07:25] age.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Because you see the Lord of restoration
[1:07:32] says when you grab the man that come to
[1:07:35] steal and Jesus said Satan comes to do
[1:07:39] what? Steal and kill and destroy.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; So that anointing comes. The lamb says
[1:07:47] come and see. Come, I will show you.
[1:07:51] Come, I will show you. He has the book
[1:07:54] open. He said, "Come."
[1:07:58] All you behind this lion anointing, come
[1:08:01] and see. Let me show you.
[1:08:04] So the lion anointing comes
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; and the book is in the hands of him that
[1:08:08] was watered to take the book
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and to loose the seals. Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; And then now he's pointing.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; You see, that is the reason why you can
[1:08:19] there is no Christian practice you can
[1:08:22] try to overcome.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; For you to overcome, you got to follow
[1:08:28] what
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; the the anointing of your age is
[1:08:31] pointing in the word.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; There must be anointing that saying see
[1:08:36] come and see.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; This is the spirit in your age. This is
[1:08:42] the thing that is bothering you in your
[1:08:44] life.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome.
[1:08:52] It's not fasting 21 days. It's not
[1:08:54] fasting seven days in a week. All of
[1:08:57] those things are good. Fasting and
[1:08:58] praying is a good thing. It's a good
[1:09:00] thing for the person to be able to draw
[1:09:02] nigh unto God. But you don't fast and
[1:09:05] pray to be able to get straight to
[1:09:08] overcome the devil that you can't see.
[1:09:12] Praise the Lord. The same way that uh
[1:09:16] your anointing is invisible.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be able also to deal with the
[1:09:24] invisible powers that is also waring
[1:09:28] against you.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see that is the reason why
[1:09:38] if this age
[1:09:40] and all the the the the propaganda and
[1:09:44] all the lies and all the deception can
[1:09:47] be able to destroy
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; your interest in listening to the
[1:09:53] messenger of your age. How are you going
[1:09:55] to overcome?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; It's not what all the preachers on
[1:09:59] YouTube
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; the other preacher says this. or you you
[1:10:03] know you must put the Bible under your
[1:10:05] pillow before you sleep. And the way you
[1:10:06] can get good sleep and vision, you must
[1:10:08] be able you can you can listen to all of
[1:10:11] those things.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; It said the beast
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; is said the anointing
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; to deal with your age.
[1:10:28] The lamb is saying to the anointing come
[1:10:33] and see.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; So everything that is happening in that
[1:10:43] is you think about it the early church
[1:10:47] one time they had a pour pour in a
[1:10:49] basket and and put him down by the wall
[1:10:53] of the city so he can he can run away.
[1:10:55] And all the persecution and and and and
[1:10:57] and the slaughter that was taking taking
[1:11:00] place in that in that age, it was
[1:11:03] identified innocent
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; as a white
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; horse. Innocent. You look at it, it's
[1:11:14] pure.
[1:11:16] That's the reason why all through the
[1:11:18] ages many people thought the White House
[1:11:20] was the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; They thought that it was the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Because it looks innocent,
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; It can quote the scripture. It quoted it
[1:11:33] to Jesus. He will give his angels charge
[1:11:36] over you.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:47] When you when you see how Constantine
[1:11:49] came in and merged with the church
[1:11:53] to many of the kind of believers, what
[1:11:56] what is wrong?
[1:11:58] We we are trying to preach the gospel to
[1:12:00] these people and they are accepting the
[1:12:02] gospel. What is wrong for for a a man
[1:12:05] like Constantine? He's going to build us
[1:12:07] a big church. They're saying that we're
[1:12:09] going from house to house and having
[1:12:10] fellowship under the tree. we would stop
[1:12:12] it now. I mean, God is bringing wealthy
[1:12:15] people in the church. You look at it, it
[1:12:17] it it looks to be good
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; because it's it's white. It's not a
[1:12:21] black. It's not black. It's just white.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Very innocent.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:29] Because all through the ages, men has
[1:12:32] always been trying to find way to make
[1:12:35] the work of God easy. It God did not
[1:12:38] give that work to you.
[1:12:40] It's not your work.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Tell it
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; all what we can do so so there can be
[1:12:48] peace. What we can do so I mean we can
[1:12:50] feed the spirit. What we can do you know
[1:12:53] let's let's uh I mean all sorts of
[1:12:55] things.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Let's let's bring disco light. I mean in
[1:13:00] the evening when the light you know when
[1:13:01] the light start changing it it makes
[1:13:03] people to move their body. We we trying
[1:13:06] to find all sorts of things
[1:13:09] to be able. The one thing that is asked
[1:13:12] of us to be born again.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; We are not ready to commit to that.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; I I I challenge you tonight if we should
[1:13:24] pass the paper around. You know what you
[1:13:26] think that will be able to help this
[1:13:28] church? Everybody get good ideas.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Everybody get good ideas.
[1:13:36] Someone said to me the other time,
[1:13:38] "Brother, why why are we just only
[1:13:40] having Wednesday service? At least we
[1:13:42] can have Wednesday and Friday."
[1:13:47] When the Wednesday service you are not
[1:13:48] here,
[1:13:52] praise the Lord. When the Wednesday
[1:13:54] service you are not here,
[1:13:58] then you want a you want a Friday
[1:14:01] service for who to attend?
[1:14:06] You I mean you are so concerned. You are
[1:14:08] concerned. You want a church to grow.
[1:14:10] You want a church to be spiritual.
[1:14:14] Good ideas, it can just it can just fly
[1:14:17] in our mind.
[1:14:25] But all of those good ideas
[1:14:28] is a white horse. Very innocent. No, I'm
[1:14:31] I'm just me. I'm just I'm just telling
[1:14:33] you. I mean, it's just uh it's just my
[1:14:35] piece of advice.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, we'll have a church
[1:14:50] meeting. I will listen to all your
[1:14:51] ideas. Please don't hold them back.
[1:14:54] Okay? Don't hold them back. I won't
[1:14:56] criticize them.
[1:14:59] Don't hold them back. Would you just
[1:15:01] tell me how you feel? What you think?
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; I have a little book uh on prayer. Ian
[1:15:14] bounds. He says man is always looking
[1:15:17] for new mentor to run the church.
[1:15:22] See God is not looking for new mentor.
[1:15:25] God is looking for men.
[1:15:29] Because the method that God started with
[1:15:31] from the beginning
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; if he can just get a man
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; that will stay with it will produce what
[1:15:38] it produced in the beginning.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; We don't need new method and new ideas.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; We just need men
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; that will be dedicated and committed
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; to taking what is what we have.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; We have not even scratched the surface.
[1:15:58] We have not scratched the surface. We
[1:16:00] have not even get wet in what we
[1:16:02] believe. They have not soak us yet.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; And yet we want to pull more over our
[1:16:08] head.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's let's come to
[1:16:16] Wednesday service and the service is
[1:16:17] going to 10 10 p.m. in the night. We
[1:16:19] say, "Oh, I mean the the Lord is
[1:16:21] blessing the service. the the presence
[1:16:23] of God is dead and and and I mean the
[1:16:25] the people are captured in the presence
[1:16:27] of God. So okay, let's let's just add
[1:16:28] another we we can't even fulfill we can
[1:16:32] fulfill to even get it to church on
[1:16:34] time.
[1:16:38] Then we get so concerned with how we so
[1:16:41] burdened.
[1:16:43] I mean if we are even having two
[1:16:45] services in a week.
[1:16:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:57] Good ideas for other people to to it.
[1:17:03] I'm not trying to be critical. I'm just
[1:17:05] trying to see to to let you to see how
[1:17:08] sometimes.
[1:17:17] Come and see.
[1:17:19] That's what
[1:17:21] the the lamb told
[1:17:26] the first anointing.
[1:17:28] Let's go down a little bit. You'll see
[1:17:30] here verse three. And when he had opened
[1:17:36] the second seal, I heard the second
[1:17:40] beast saying, "Come and see." So now it
[1:17:44] was the age of the ox.
[1:17:47] Come and see. Come and see the power
[1:17:51] that is slaughtering the church.
[1:17:54] The lamb is saying, "Come and see."
[1:17:59] And the thing about it there is that the
[1:18:02] same anointing here that was innocent
[1:18:06] has now changed its marks.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was white and innocent yet it
[1:18:13] has become red and bloody.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Is the same spirit.
[1:18:18] The same lying spirit is the same thing
[1:18:20] that gossip.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit that that commit
[1:18:25] adultery. It's just the same spirit.
[1:18:27] They are not different.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; It's just the same spirit taking another
[1:18:31] form.
[1:18:34] It's the same spirit. It was just one
[1:18:36] spirit moving to another.
[1:18:41] It just changed his mass. Yeah. It was
[1:18:43] looking so innocent.
[1:18:46] Everybody say it's a good idea.
[1:18:49] The church is getting big.
[1:18:53] The Roman people are now believing. Do
[1:18:55] you know the truth? believers at that
[1:18:57] time they were still gathering in house.
[1:19:01] They were not associating with what
[1:19:03] Constantine started.
[1:19:07] This group that that Paul wrote the book
[1:19:09] of Romans 12.
[1:19:19] How can we overcome
[1:19:21] is by hearing the voice of the lamb that
[1:19:25] says come and see. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; You know when that voice spoke in our
[1:19:29] day, you know what it said? Good morning
[1:19:32] friends.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; He said good morning friends.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; When he say good morning friends on the
[1:19:40] tapes
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; he say come and see.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm about to show you.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; That's it. I'm about to show you what is
[1:19:48] happening in your day.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; How did Daniel broke into into spiritual
[1:19:57] warfare?
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; How did Daniel broke into spiritual
[1:20:02] warfare? The Bible says he went to the
[1:20:04] prophet Jeremiah book.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; He went into the message of Jeremiah.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You will never be able to see the
[1:20:15] weight of your age.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; You will never be able to see uh the
[1:20:18] things that is happening in your day and
[1:20:21] around you.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I just listening to brother Ben. Where's
[1:20:26] where's my phone?
[1:20:29] I left you in the office. I just
[1:20:30] listening to him today and you were
[1:20:31] saying some things and and it it just
[1:20:34] destroyed the day that we are living in.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just distract the day.
[1:20:39] It's 9:00. I can't I won't I don't want
[1:20:41] to send for my phone and get into that
[1:20:43] and and you listen to that voice
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; you get into the word
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; and if you are really in the word there
[1:20:52] is something in your daily activity
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost would pick up
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; something you have read
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; something you have heard
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost will pick up
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; and when he pick it up, it is that voice
[1:21:12] of the lamb come and see.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; It's not by religious practice.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We overcome by hearing the voice of the
[1:21:25] lamb. The Bible say they overcame by the
[1:21:28] blood of the lamb.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; And the words of his testimony.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; What is that? It's the bleeding word.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; It's the bleeding word. That's how we
[1:21:38] overcome.
[1:21:41] That's how we deal with situations.
[1:21:44] When they come, we listen to that voice.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come and see. Wash up." It's
[1:21:49] the enemy trying to do something.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; You know then brother Bram says when you
[1:21:54] get to that place then you realize it's
[1:21:56] not your wife, it's not your husband,
[1:21:58] it's not your brother, it's not your
[1:22:00] sister. You realize that it's the enemy
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; because you are listening to the voice
[1:22:04] of the lamb and then the anointing of
[1:22:06] your age.
[1:22:08] Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Will not expose the enemy.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; If not, you are just cannon. You are
[1:22:15] fighting a losing battle because all the
[1:22:17] cannon thought you in your mind will
[1:22:19] just frustrate you.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; God will not honor it.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; He will not anoint it because it is not
[1:22:26] his word.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; It will make you mad. It will make you
[1:22:29] angry. You will just you will just be
[1:22:31] nervous. You will just be frustrated.
[1:22:34] Why? Because you are feeling on your own
[1:22:36] dead thoughts.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; You are not feeling. You are not
[1:22:39] listening to the voice of the lamb.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; that's why we can overcome
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; because we are we are we are learning to
[1:22:47] believe ourself.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; We are making ourself God.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We establish our thoughts. We
[1:22:57] believe it. We hold to it.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; It said the word of God. It say prove it
[1:23:01] in the word. Can you prove it by the
[1:23:04] word?
[1:23:07] How do we overcome?
[1:23:12] How do we overcome?
[1:23:16] The Lord bless you. We'll continue.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord tonight.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:23:25] Welcome to praise. Let's give the Lord a
[1:23:27] hand of praise. Amen.
[1:23:34] Hallelujah.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; You know, as I was studying the subject
[1:23:45] today, I was thinking about a little
[1:23:48] song we used to sing many years back.
[1:23:50] Come and see the man Jesus. The man, the
[1:23:53] man who told me everything that I have
[1:23:56] done. Amen.
[1:24:00] Praise the Lord. Y'all, you never heard
[1:24:01] it before. So, we try we'll try to make
[1:24:03] it happen. Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] I didn't even write itself. I was
[1:24:09] thinking about writing it, but I was
[1:24:10] right in the midst of studying.
[1:24:15] I think if you checked it, I might have
[1:24:16] said it long time ago, but I don't know
[1:24:20] those those songs come to my mind. And
[1:24:22] uh let's stand on our feet. We'll pray
[1:24:25] and then we let you go home tonight.

[1:27:56] Let's pray together tonight. Heavenly
[1:27:59] Father,
[1:28:00] you are the lamb. Revelation chapter 5.
[1:28:03] There was no man worthy to open the
[1:28:05] book. There was just no man worthy to
[1:28:09] open the book to lose the seal.
[1:28:13] John said, "One came forth,
[1:28:16] a bleeding lamb. You took the book. You
[1:28:19] loosed the seal."
[1:28:22] And Lord, you have called us to come and
[1:28:24] see
[1:28:27] through the message of Malachi 4. You
[1:28:30] have opened our eyes, Lord.
[1:28:33] And Father, how can we over these
[1:28:35] things? Lord, you are show showing us
[1:28:38] the adulterous spirit in this age. Lord,
[1:28:42] you are showing us, oh God, Father, a
[1:28:44] word, Lord God, Father, even a a 1933
[1:28:48] vision, Lord, Father God, Lord, miracle
[1:28:51] in in in in the grace, oh God,
[1:28:56] you said come and see.
[1:29:00] Come and see how far how how Lord we
[1:29:03] have turned away from that voice. Lord,
[1:29:06] we are making our own image images,
[1:29:08] Lord. Father,
[1:29:10] instead of looking into the the word,
[1:29:13] looking into the things that you have
[1:29:14] opened, the word you have opened, the
[1:29:17] revelation you have open,
[1:29:21] Father,
[1:29:23] if it was not because of this message of
[1:29:25] the hour, Lord, if it was not because of
[1:29:28] the grace that came to our heart and the
[1:29:31] things, the little things that you have
[1:29:32] shown us in the word, how God, how can
[1:29:35] we just take little and run with it and
[1:29:37] feel like we know
[1:29:40] when we have not even scratched the
[1:29:41] surface Lord. We have not even really
[1:29:44] got down there Lord God. We just hear
[1:29:47] about water baptism in Jesus name and
[1:29:50] one God and the gohead and and father
[1:29:52] all of these little things
[1:29:55] they have just make us to be so
[1:29:57] critical.
[1:30:00] When there is when there is more. When
[1:30:02] there is more.
[1:30:04] When there is more.
[1:30:07] You told us to come and see it. And now
[1:30:09] we know what is happening behind the
[1:30:11] curtains of time.
[1:30:13] You told us to come and see.
[1:30:17] You said there was going to be an
[1:30:19] American pop and now we seeing it. It
[1:30:22] was right in there.
[1:30:29] The devil get us so busy we can't even
[1:30:32] open your word and say Lord show me to
[1:30:35] see.
[1:30:38] There's no time to listen to uh uh uh uh
[1:30:41] uh uh the prophet message even the ones
[1:30:43] we play on Sunday. I mean uh thank you
[1:30:46] for the few that are able to get here
[1:30:48] Lord and become part of it and those
[1:30:50] that are streaming online oh God. But
[1:30:53] father are we really into the word? Are
[1:30:56] we really listening with a hungry heart?
[1:31:00] It's not for an entertainment, Lord God.
[1:31:02] It's to be able to show us the things
[1:31:05] that we need to know in this age how we
[1:31:09] can be able to overcome, how we can be
[1:31:12] able to overcome bad feelings,
[1:31:14] misunderstanding. You you taught us it
[1:31:17] in the word. It's right there in the
[1:31:19] message of the hour. Brother Abraham
[1:31:21] says God God being misunderstood. If God
[1:31:24] if if if if God the creator could be
[1:31:27] misundersto what about you and myself?
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:36] Oh father, thank you tonight.
[1:31:39] Thank you tonight Jesus.
[1:31:42] I want to constantly listen to your
[1:31:44] voice that say come and see.
[1:31:47] Come and see. Lord,
[1:31:49] you are the lamb that has shown us all
[1:31:52] the things that we know. That is the
[1:31:54] only way we can overcome. Not by our
[1:31:57] ideas, not by our emotion. Is all flesh.
[1:32:02] It's all flesh. And your word say it
[1:32:05] stinks. It stings before you. Flesh
[1:32:09] stinks before you.
[1:32:11] When we put our flesh to things and it a
[1:32:15] stick on our bones and it's seen in our
[1:32:18] face and it's in our it sting before the
[1:32:20] father.
[1:32:24] Oh help us Lord
[1:32:26] have mercy. Lord God
[1:32:29] have mercy. Jesus
[1:32:33] have mercy Lord. The quote of the dead
[1:32:36] is not enough. We must listen to that
[1:32:39] voice. We must listen to that voice.

[1:32:49] create a desire in us, Lord. Even our
[1:32:52] young people, even our young people,
[1:32:54] Father, Lord,
