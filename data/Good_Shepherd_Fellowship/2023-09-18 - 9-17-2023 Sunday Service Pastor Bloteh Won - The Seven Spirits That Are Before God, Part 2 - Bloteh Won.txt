to brother Daley during the week he sent his greetings uh it is uh today that uh Christian Fellowship will be having the election of the pastor the electing brother uh James brother James into office this morning and next week they would like to uh put him into our office inaugurate him into his pastoral office so they would like us to come and support them on the weekend so we trust the Lord to see how things should go but uh if happens that I'm gone then I won't be here on Sunday so uh but there will speak for us you will just pray for the service praise the Lord amen and uh if you can see here you will see it and understand that I'm a little bit slow this morning and uh maybe for good reasons I don't know but I want to trust and rest on the grace of God this morning for us to bring the word out on a Wednesday night we started speaking on on the subject I thought I was just bringing something because of what uh brother Dilly started the Council of God and I was looking into it and I said I was sharing with you my notes but as I went back and started meditating over the subject I feel like there were some things that I left out on Wednesday night so I just want to wrap it up if I can be able to do it this morning so that's what we would like to go into let's let's sing a song Here praise the Lord let's sing a song in Elijah we want to say congratulations and may God bless you as we go [Applause] [Music] let's sing a song here uh [Music] oh yes [Music] there's another song I sang back there but we have now practice there so I'm not going to go into it before I run everything this morning amen praise the Lord let's sing Standing on the Promises amen that's what we want to do this morning let's sing a chorus or two of that and then we can change your order of the service their prom ISE [Music] Standing on the Promises of God happy birthday [Music] Christ my savior standing I am standing on the promising subject one more verse now [Music] and yeah [Music] for us one more time I'm standing [Music] standing on the cross savior [Music] praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen God bless you musicians let's take our Bibles and uh and we will ask you to just bear with us let's read a scripture here very familiar to US during the time of communion but uh Paul speaks about Discerning the laws boarding so I want to read their scripture uh in their context then we go in right into what we want to say praise the Lord I know uh is being why since we had our last convenience service we uh we are praying and looking forward to the next one but this is the word of the Lord is now only for convenience service it is also an instruction from the Lord to us so let's just read First Corinthians chapter 11. we will some become a denomination if we just try setting scripture to just one activity amen and uh if we were not re-testinal learning all the time only when we have him buried and said though that are in Christ will rise first then we become in a denomination praise the Lord but let's read year First Corinthians chapter 11 reading from verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I deliver unto you I thought about this scripture during the week because uh I was I was listening to a documentary of some uh historians that was talking about the early Creed what they call the early Creed sorry to keep you standing and what they call the early Creed was the little note that the disciples had that they were passing around from what the witness in in Jesus ministry and one of them were referring to this as something that was part of the early Cree because you have to remember Paul was not in the community the first communion service Paul was not in Saint John chapter 13. you know when they had a communion so they were referring to this that Paul got this from some of those little notes that were going around and uh so I went back and I started reading and I got into a little place here and and that's the reason why I paused because he says for I have received of the Lord that which I deliver unto you let's let's go ahead and read and then we will come in that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he breaks it and and said take it this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me the Bible says and then after the same manner he took the cup but let's uh let's let's drop down uh a little bit here verse 28 balletta a man is jamming himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup for he that eat it and drinketh on water it eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body the Lord bless you you may have your seed praise the Lord not Discerning the Lord's body now so uh so I went back and then uh look into the scripture and I says well yeah I've always I've always taught and believed because Paul said I have received of the Lord that in some sense it was a kind of a Divine instruction that was given to him praise the Lord and because he was a prophet he was also taught by God through visions and uh but like I said we we will we will go back to some of our pictures and some of the things we shared on on Wednesday night but I want to go in a direction the reason why I read this scripture is because of first king let's go to the book of first king let's go to the book of first king chapter 3. and the scripture there that we're going to read actually it is it is where the Bible will talk about Solomon prayer we know it as Solomon prayer but the Bible which says that Solomon had a dream and uh and and uh and for the way that we've been taught a dream that that comes to pass a dream is a secondary vision praise the Lord so a direct dream is a vision it's just that the person didn't see it with their eye open but it's a vision now so if you look at the scripture here you know uh in the way that uh the Bible uh placed it I just want for us to just uh first king chapter 3. praise the Lord they are so uh Solomon will be asking the Lord of something and God will say that you ask the right thing I'm going to give it to you and the Bible we we mentioned Discerning judgment that was the reason why I read that First Corinthians uh scripture because we re-year that God gave Solomon a gift of discernment praise the Lord he gave him a gift of the sermon but let's read this together uh verse 3 will give us a good picture here and Solomon loved the Lord walking in the Statue of David his father only he sacrificed and burned incense in high places now if you go back to verse 2 the Bible says only the people sacrifice in high places because there was no house bill on to the name of the Lord until those days now you will see a little bit here in in their reading that these places that is called high places where places where people there was something that bothered Israel India travel it was idolatrying amen it was idolatry so uh you you find that over and over in the book of Kings where it was hard for the people to get away from our dollar train and in so much that it was seeing God they were still going to those high places and burning incense praise the Lord are we together amen I don't want to lose you even though I'm slow but I don't want to lose you amen praise the Lord either I drag you or you drag me but I'll feel good if you do the dragon amen but the reason why I pause a little bit is because this this context this place of high places you will realize that in the book of Ephesians the Bible says God has blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places and in Ephesians chapter 6 The Bible will say stick up all the the whole armor of God We rise on that against uh flesh and blood but against principalities and spiritual weakness in high places so we have gone over there before so one of the things one of the things that as we continue in our journey we're going to look at the Tabernacle again and I'll show you some of those things that uh for which reason I want to come to this subject one of the things that we will constantly deal with until we leave this uh Earth and goes to our internal home will be idolatry praise the Lord it will come to us in different forms it will now be a worshiping Asian girls but it will be something that the enemy will want to live up in your life above the word of God anything that is lifted up in our life above the word of God is an idol praise the Lord amen now so here the Bible says the people were going to the high places because there was no house that was built to the name of the Lord until that time verse 3 again Solomon loved the Lord he walked in the statues of David his father only he sacrificed and burned incense in high places and the King went to gibeon to sacrifice therefore that was the great high place a thousand uh Brent offering did Solomon offer upon the altar in gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night and God said ask what Ash I gave thee praise the Lord what an opportunity if God will speak to us this morning which of course is speaking to you what will I give thee what is the primary thing on your heart that's one of the things I want for us to realize because you you see when you read the word we have a way of adjusting our mind praise the Lord of adjusting our mind but you you have to remember that God told Solomon and look at I mean God told Samuel and look at the heart it's not you adjusting your mind in the present circumstance or you adjusting your mind you know when the question is given to you but God is looking at your heart amen you could be asked uh what what is that what is the most thing that the Lord that you will want for the Lord to do with you I may do for you and you were saying that um when you're doing that all you're trying to do you are adjusting your mind but God that knows the heart he already knows what is primary on your heart he knows what is primary on our heart this morning even though we are sitting in the house of the Lord we're saying God speak to me I want God to speak to me praise the Lord amen but he already knows what is the primary thing on your heart that's one of the things we want to look at this morning so the Bible says God asks Solomon and says ask what I shall give thee and Solomon said thou has shown unto their servant David my father great Mercy I calling to I call in as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness praise the Lord in uprightness of heart with thee and there has kept for him this great kindness that thou have given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day and now oh Lord my God there have made that seven King instead of David my father and and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or to come in praise the Lord last Sunday we saw through the word of the Lord how the kingdom was taken away from Saul amen praise the Lord because he was mad he was not obedient to the Consulate of the Lord he was not willing to follow God in order of his word the kingdom was taken from Saul and now we're seeing that the kingdom now and his David and David now is giving it over to his son and Solomon is rehearsing all of these things to the Lord he says I'm a child I know I know not how to go out and to come in and and i7 is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be number non-countered for multitude praise the Lord amen the reason why they cannot be normal or counted is because God's presence surround His People praise the Lord amen give therefore that servant and understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and by praise the Lord that very thing that Solomon was praying for the Holy Ghost has brought it to us now this is the picture that I want us to grab this morning Solomon is saying your people is such of a great people I don't know how to go out I don't know how to handle them I don't know how to go out and come in among them I want an honest turning heart I want a spirit of discernment praise the Lord Paul in a new testament he's saying that the very thing that Solomon is saying Paul is saying that uh we we have to discern the body of the Lord we have to have a discernment of God's people amen we don't we don't judge them by their appearance or by the things that they are going through because just like Solomon says they are such a great people praise the Lord what is the greatness is Christ in you the hope of glory that is the greatness it's not the building it's not the amount of people but these this is the people that are possessing Jesus Christ are you seeing the picture so Paul is saying that uh that's one thing we must watch to discern the body of the Lord praise the Lord because that scripture is generally and mostly read during communion is so easy for for for for for the devil to get it on our mind that that is only speaking about communion but we know it is not Discerning the Lost body that's where brother Brandon preached from that was the scripture that he read that's what we are called to do is to discern God's body the way we think about God's children the things we say about them Solomon is saying your people are such a great people I'm just a child praise the Lord and no matter how long we've been serving the lord this is not on our natural age group it's also understanding what God is doing among his people praise the Lord it's what God is doing among his people as a local body what God is doing among his people as uh uh uh as a word body because sometimes when we're wearing ourselves Russia's cult we're wearing a coat of self-righteousness we speak so carelessly about God's people we speak about things just like Jude would say in the book of Jude things that we don't understand about foreign things that we don't understand and we think we know praise the Lord Solomon is saying here gave thy servant and understanding heart to judge the people praise the Lord that word George was not to tell who's right or who's wrong it comes from that sense of the word to discern praise the Lord to discern Lord help me to be slow to speak praise the Lord let me pray to understand what's really happening are we together to judge the people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this they are so great a people praise the Lord and sometimes we don't see it like that we get so familiar with one another you know we can we can just swing through our mind we know everybody in the church whether we know their name on that you know and then we feel like we know there are situations we feel like we know what they are dealing with sure oh is it not that one nothing funny here nothing funny nothing funny I want us to see the real picture he says who is able to judge this if we realize that the church is containing the mystery of God great is the mystery of godliness praise the Lord we will be very careful you will be very very careful some of the things we think in our mind even though we don't say it but the way our mind runs we will be careful who is able to judge this there are so great a people and their speech please the Lord that Solomon heart acts distinct and God said unto him because thou have asked this thing and have not asked for themselves long life neither have asked riches for themselves none have asked the life of thine enemy but have asked for thyself almost turning to discern judgment understanding to discern judgment understanding to know what to say in a given time of crisis not just only to talk from a place of hurt praise the Lord because you also have to realize that nothing will befall you except the Lord allow it and if the Lord allowed that is his way of pulling you on his will to spin you amen now so understanding to discern judgment to know what to say in every giving moment the law said because you have asked that behold ah I have done I call into thy words Lord I have given deed a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before the neither after thee shall earning arise like unto thee praise the Lord amen the internet give us access to you know many things flying up on social media Google and YouTube and all of that you know we you know you can hear about something in South Africa or go right on YouTube and put it up and you watch it and pretty soon you know what was there I mean you can be talking as if to say you were there I said to say you met the people well may God give us Grace amen may God give us Grace the Lord said behold I have done this you know while you you ask a good thing I have given it to thee I won't want to spend much of a time here on this but you will realize that the Bible says here in verse 15 and Solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and offer a burnt offering and offer peace offering and made a feast to uh to all his seven realizing it was a dream he came right before the Lord he lived for his hands he said a word of prayer to the Lord he you know committed all in the hands of the law then the scripture will tell us right after death God is going to bring there to manifestation because that will be the time the two women who are I will be will be wrestling over the baby and then uh and then Solomon would say bring the baby here you caught the baby into half sense one there is we don't know who the child is what actually he was looking for he was looking for feeling because there is feeling in love amen he was looking for feeling praise the Lord amen the one that that had no attachment she said yeah that's the best thing you killed the child the one that had attachment she said no give it to her and Solomon who discerned right there praise the Lord you see he was not quick quick to speak he was not even convinced by their tears all the way they were I mean explaining he was not convinced by that he went for something more he was not looking at our appearance how well you can explain your case and no no no he was looking for something more he was looking for something inside something that was not seen by the natural eyes praise the Lord so we see here that the Lord granted him the Lord granted him this gift of discernment we're coming back to our Tabernacle I'm just I'm just trying to find my 14 year don't worry praise the Lord then the Bible will led us to note over in chapter four if you want to go there with me quickly the last few verses in chapter 4 the Bible will let us to know in verse 29 and God gave Solomon wisdom understanding exceeding much and lastness of heart even as the sin that is on the sea show and Solomon wisdom Excel the wisdom of the children of the East Country and all the wisdom of Egypt for he was wise he called all of those wise men of those days verse 32 and he speak 3 000 Proverbs and his Psalms were a thousand and five he speaks of three you know you you read that in the book of of of proverb he says he says uh uh see the way of an ant amen amen he look at his look at the ants he's he's saying God's wisdom in the ants he said look at the word of the ego he said three things that's too wonderful for me and all of these things the scripture says where Solomon wisdom he could look at those things and he could pull knowledge out of them praise the Lord amen but the thing that is uh uh uh the thing that is that is uh uh that is wonderful year is that you will see the other with all of this wisdom that Solomon had praise the Lord when you come to the New Testament even our lord Jesus even our lord Jesus will say Solomon in all of his wisdom amen Solomon in all of his wisdom cannot be compared to the ladies of the field our lord Jesus was saved and he will also say yeah greater than Solomon is here are we together amen so God blessed Solomon with wisdom but you realize that it was temporary amen and Paul will capitalize on that where there is wisdom it will fill where there is prophecies it would seize he will come in the book of Corinthians and he will he will catch that it was temporary because with all the wisdom that Solomon had he couldn't keep himself from trouble his wisdom could not keep him from idolatrying yes that's the picture I want us to see this morning amen with all the wisdom he had it was not one that he acquired in school it was something that God gave him praise the Lord it was something that God gave him but yet Jesus would come oh the Bible says even all the princes the the Queen of Sheba and all of those people they admire Solomon wisdom but yet he didn't have wisdom enough to keep himself away from his idols praise the Lord he didn't have wisdom enough to keep himself away from our idolatry he married you know all of his wife and fell by their idols and and and and and and Ecclesiastes he would tell us about the vanity of life but what I want us to think about this morning before we get into our subject if I will have time to preach let's make a contrast with Solomon Father David let's make a contrast with Solomon Father David Psalm chapter 27. love the Lord praise the Lord the Lord is guilty amen are we together we know that the Bible called David a man after God's Own Heart praise the Lord the Bible will show us some characteristics of David and one of the things was very hard a repented heart David was was was one of the men that will run to God quickly amen he had a repainted heart but here in this Psalm there is something that is placed here of David I won't read the whole Psalm you know what it is you can go read it meditate upon it memorize it it will do you good but let's read verse four David expressing here in this prayer he said one thing half a desire of the Lord that I will seek after not wisdom not knowledge one thing my inner desire praise the Lord Solomon asked God for wisdom because he he saw how his father the influence that his father had no even there Solomon never had to fight one war everything that Solomon Solomon just built the temple David paid for it David was the one that paid for it go to Haram go to Tasha's he sent him all over gave him his contact he pay for it praise the Lord with his character with his contact are we together so Solomon was asking for for for wisdom from the law because he he realized I I don't want to mess this thing up praise the Lord amen this thing that has been given to me I I don't want to mess it up I don't want to put myself to the play Lord I really need wisdom to be able to deal with all and when you read you read Solomon one of the way he kept peace with the Nations around him was Every Nation around here he took a wife from the King praise the Lord so if you want to fight me you're coming okay your daughter and your grandchildren praise the Lord are you seeing the picture here are you seeing the picture because it will not mean much to you if we're going to December this morning if you don't see the picture David said one thing have a desire of the Lord therefore I seek after praise the Lord that I made the word in the house of the Lord all the days of my life one thing have I desire even if I don't understand the mystery if I make mistakes but my desire My driven desire is that I would work in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord entering choir to learn to learn of him praise the Lord amen poured on an inspiration who picked that up in Corinthians chapter 11 where he talks about the the the the love chapter he will pick that up to let us to know the word there is wisdom it will fail amen he says wisdom knowledge puff up if it is not driven by love if God is Not on on the throne of your heart it would just be for Showmanship praise the Lord and it will still not do you any good so I wanted to bring I wanted to bring this contract this morning to be able to build a foundation grab your attention this morning since I'm slow that my slowness will not confuse you praise the Lord amen and uh so you see there in Old Testament I mean in the New Testament Solomon Glory was was them on his his glory in Old Testament in his time it was it was glorious but all of that but when it came over to the New Testament there was not much that was accounted for his glory praise the Lord Solomon in all his glory could not be like one of the ladies amen and Jesus said you are greater than the ladies so he was trying to say there is a greater glory that is coming on you amen there's a greater glory that the Holy Ghost brings on the believer then the glory of wealth and wives in Hershey's in homes there is a greater glory that the Holy Ghost brings upon the believer because she's supposed to be glory greater than Solomon is here amen now so with with that background with that background if I'm not mistaken as you have a uh one quote here from from Discerning the laws Discerning the body of the Lord let's read that and then we can we can go back into our Wednesday night subject now uh just to be able to kind of a close-up and wrap the whole thing up amen Discerning the body of the Lord barbam says that now our internal destination is now altogether determined by what we see or what we year praise the Lord but it's determined on what discernment what Josh meant we make amen what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear praise the Lord Hallelujah amen so if our our sisters will help us let's go back there and look at the Old Testament Tabernacle uh that would be one of uh the the one of the First pictures we put up if you just go by by the order of the pictures the first one will be the Old Testament Tabernacle are we together I'm sure I didn't lost you amen show up they lost you praise the Lord just like we said it was a faction that God gave to Moses and uh yes that's right and and and and and and Moses bring this blueprint of the Tabernacle and then Solomon will will bear on it will go and see there with Solomon now so with the Tabernacle here there are just few things that I wanted for us to to look at praise the Lord this is the auto Court of the Tabernacle is this the inner call and this is the holiest of holy now one thing you will realize here is that the auto call this is the place of sacrifice the altar the sacrifice the the lovers and and this will will will will represent uh uh the Justified believer this would be justification you know I believe the Lord what and but what I want us to see is that this man that is outside he's not in the auto Court he's outside outside the whole outside yeah amen benefit from the light off the Sun and the moon he benefit from the natural light the man that is that have crossed this gate and have come into Christ by faith also benefit from the same light praise the Lord I'll take a little speed on that it may it tells us now remember man we're talking about Discerning we're talking about uh uh uh uh uh adjustment so right here because this person is benefiting from the the natural light year most of the things that we believe we are also driven by our five senses praise the Lord amen we we you know we we we we talk about it you know we we feel the presence of the Lord and you know and then uh you know and you know someone talk to you you get sad it it looks to you like the president don't love you you know it's it's just you are just driving by your senses just like the man outside there is there is a little sense of Faith here amen but you are on the much of the influence of your five senses right here right in here like we said right here here was uh the candlestick right here is the Candlestick so this person in you in here is driven by candle light amen the light is under his honor Candlelight this person is on the daylight natural light this this guy right in here he's influenced by candlelight and what happens to the candle light is the other it can get dim if the oil goes dry amen sometimes they can smoke up are we together Hallelujah you see but because this guy right here knows that he's on a candlelight uh uh uh what what happens to him is that uh if if he's if he stood that understanding uh uh I mean what whether whether he feels good or mad he knows that he he have a place with God amen he just know that the world that is is a spiritual warfare he has to fight you know he he needs breakthrough you know uh he he he he he uh he concentrates to the word praise the Lord but behind the veil here was the Shekinah the glory of the Lord amen the presence of the Lord here was what create a light it was God's presence the light in this place are we together so this is this is this is in our walk as as believers this is our walk this is the place that we walk we came from right in the word saved by grace we came true here amen we believe the Lord Jesus Christ that he died for our sin we identify with him in water baptism if you have not done it there is no reason why you should be uh serving God and you're now baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus yet are we together and then we go into our our Nest stage of walk that has to do with the the sanctification the place of sanctification so you see here this is the the the Candlestick and this is the the table of ShopRite so right there is word you really start feeling on the word amen is easy to feel on man's idea praise the Lord you're looking for a solution you can feel on anything can make sense to you anything that they put Jesus on can make sense to you but a man that is in here he's eating only the shortbread praise the Lord watch this David when when David went to the Tabernacle when he was running away he met the priest he says my man I'm hungry is there anything to eat the priesthood is only only the shortbread if your man has kept themselves from women so even at that time the priest was demanding a level of Life of sanctification are we together so we see here all of these three stages that are light year this high priest that goes in here one time in in a year he's affected by the presence of God yeah it was the presence of God that was Lighting in the place it was the presence of God the heart the glory in the place they don't have to walk are worried about whether the the the light will go off or not and right in year the Mana that felt that they took from from outside year when it got in here it never died it never get rotten it was sustained by the presence of God are we together amen and also right in here that was where Aaron Rod was also pulled a dry Road started to bring for leaves because it was affected by the presence of God praise the Lord it was affected by the presence of God in the building year we don't have a split into three places where we say it's okay that you stay oh yeah we all comes into the building but yet in our walk in our stages of walk we still have these three steps right in this building this morning are we together now I thought that I would have brought a little picture of uh talking about light talking about light I was I was uh trying to rush in and and and get that in uh uh but uh it kind of uh kind of a loss there what actually I would have wanted to do with that is that I was going to show uh the Candlestick light that was drawn during the church ages praise the Lord just like how it was uh uh [Music] uh how it is with the believer is also uh uh dispensational with the ages but I will look for it another time to be able to bring that so we can we can be able to see that as we as we look at that praise the Lord are we together amen now so that was the tabernacle there was the tabernacle that we just we just show you can we go to the picture of the Temple yeah I think I still have a few minutes praise the Lord um Solomon on an inspiration came and he built a temple just with the same pattern that Moses built the Tabernacle Sunday I mean Wednesday now we spoke about the two pillows and this was called Solomon porch on the temple but it was the porch of the the so what what I want to go into now this morning as I talked about uh been on the ah the influence of light the light that is outside affect the person on a justification it affect the person in the in the auto call he he can only benefit from the sunlight or the Moonlight the natural light the the person in the inner call benefit from the the Candlestick light amen the the benefit from the candles still lie so that's the reason why you will see it in Revelation chapter one it talks about the seven golden Candlestick amen and if you go to Revelation chapter 1 you will realize that the church Ages was either Seven golden candlesticks or what Seven Stars so the church ages will be it will be a night period praise the Lord it will be a night period that's the reason why brother Brandon will tell us that the messenger comes at the end of the age are we together in Revelation chapter 1 the church Ages was represented by the the the golden candlesticks the all seven stars in the right hand of the Lord Jesus and stars only come up in the night praise the Lord now but but just like I said on Wednesday night there is something that was that was a little bit different from the Tabernacle what is that it is these little rooms back here praise the Lord when Solomon built a tabernacle this storage were built here for the priests and it is in yet the priests kept their idols praise the Lord oh I say I just because I knew you would get your attention I knew it would get your attention but what does that represent to us now you have to know that what God was stubborn was was targeting to do it in with you he do not do it in Temple made with hands he started from the Tabernacle of Moses that were built with King he came to the Temple of Solomon but what God was targeting is to do it in you praise the Lord so Solomon Solomon Tabernacle it brings out more picture yeah that we never saw in the Tabernacle of Moses the temple brings out more pictures uh Wednesday night we read seven scripture where Paul identified us as the Temple of the Living God amen now so there is something that we deal with as we were looking uh uh Wednesday night we deal with this we talk about these these two poachers meaning uh established in counsel and strength and uh one is Council Jacob and Boaz his strength and as we said they were placed there for Monument they were placed there for a testament they never had nothing to do in hole in the Tabernacle God was just showing that uh he's building his Tabernacle he says I'll be in my church the gifts of Hell will not Prevail against it amen now so we we look at this and uh we went back a little bit and and we were looking at what Moses said in Deuteronomy chapter 6. you know Ezra the Lord your God is one love the Lord with all of your heart out of your mind out of your strength no love the Lord with all of your heart out of your soul out of your mind and all of your strength praise the Lord in the in the New Testament Mark chapter 12 verse telling Jesus will pick up the same thing amen he says which commandment is the greatest he says Thou know amen and he repeated exactly because he was a prophet like unto Moses he repeated exactly what Jesus I mean Moses said are we together praise the Lord Paul will come in Hebrew chapter 4 verse 12. now you have to remember we went through we went over all of this amen I'm just trying to bring it together so if I if we turn into every scripture it would take up much time you can write it down and and read it we read about that and in Hebrew 4 12 the word of God is sharper than any two edges swore amen peers in the heart going to the dividing asunder that's what I want I want to do her on this morning because it would it will help us to understand what these things are around the temple you are the temple of God but you have these little pockets you know brother Brian will speak in the message those indoors and he will let us to know how we open the door of our heart to the Lord but there are other doors that we will not allow God to enter in he will bring that picture so we can be able to see that's what this in Solomon temples will represent another thing that this thing will represent also will be our subconscious our subconscious our pockets were Idols are kept the Bible says a wounded Spirit who can heal praise the Lord so all of these storage year around where you have to realize that the temple representing you there is nothing that was placed on Solomon Temple that does not speak of you are we together so we see here because we will not be able to see ourselves perfectly or to be able to bring this thing through we got to look at the temple so we we look we already talk about the the influence of light uh the article like inner Collide the presence of God the glory of God and uh uh because now so these uh these these uh personal storage pockets it comes to speak to the believer and it it it it it led us to know that uh because just like I said the Bible says love the Lord with all of your heart amen is not talking about that that place where the the blood comes from are we together amen law of the law with all of your mind Paul in the Book of Romans will led us to see how the mind and the spirit the similarity between the mind and the spirit loving the Lord with all of your spirit loving the Lord will order off your strength like we said Wednesday night is not talking about your energy because I'm telling you these guys that are doing weight lifting they can have more energy than you and myself are we together but Paul will let us to know that the word of God is sharper than the two-edges swore the word is able to go and be able to tell us out of this Pockets what it is praise the Lord the world will tell you when it is your spirit or when it is your soul Brothers will tell us that the boy they have five senses and that's how that's how come we can contact the outer part of our body he will talks about how the spirit also have five senses amen but the soul have one sense he said it's either Faith or doubt you are either driven by faith or you are driven by doubt amen praise the Lord but you will realize that when you look at uh uh uh your actions and your reactions when you are when when we are dealing with things just like I said it's easy for us to adjust our mind and that's why most of the time the Believers we try to do the word is preached we try to adjust our minds says what actually it is is that we are receiving the word by mental faith as we are adjusting our mind and adjusting that word to ourselves we are receiving the word by mental faith that's what he called the right mentored attitude so if we can keep that word in the right mental attitude then it will drop down and become a faith that can live through our body praise the Lord have you ever got to this place word you really thought you believe something you really thought you can stand it but then when it comes to the reality you back off because your faith is just in your mind it's just in your mind when it comes to standing for Christ and being a witness whether to order or to the devil we back off because that faith is not real yet are we together so the word of God sharper than the two ages sword is able to go that's the reason why the the prophet of God honored this sermon he can be able to go down into a person's subconscious and tell them this is the thing that is bothering you that is the thing this is the either that is creating an hindrance for you to receive your healing this is something that is buried in your spirit praise the Lord our age this age with its religious spirit you have to realize that this is a religious age there have never been an edge where there have been a bunch of preachers claiming Deliverance right in that oppressive streaming or just are speaking in tongue so that brings the is the word that brings Deliverance because it's the word that divides yes the word I identified are we together is the word that is able to help you to go back and say okay I see what this is right and the moment the words identify that that's your deliverance praise the Lord the moment the word Shines on it and identify that this is worthy of the source of your problem is that's your deliverance it is now now for you to walk in faith but you know that Old Devil is not going to let you go like that praise the Lord he will keep backing he's a dog backing with no teeth in his mouth if you just only listening to the loudness of his back you be afraid but if your faith is in God's word for he that the son has set free this freed indeed praise the Lord most of the things that brother Brandon will say is he says faith is a subconscious thing to the believer most of the things that uh we we deal with that I think I share that with you but I had a Grace and I was inspired to preach that last year uh in that convention in South Africa looking at what uh when the uh the scientists trying to uh what what they compare they compare with uh our subconscious they took that and and did a comparison with the Titanic there is a part of the shape that's you know up above the water that people can see the beauty the deck and all of that they said that that's our first conscious there is another part that goes deep down into the sea praise the Lord and that's our subconscious now so you see the word can be able you know when Birdman talking in in that message those indoors you know uh you know he picks up different things if you listen to all the different series he talks about different things you know those that we don't want to let Christ in praise the Lord and it's all because we are keeping something there and whatever it is I don't know what it is but whatever it is will be an idol and that thing will be causing us robbing us of walking in total freedom and victory in the word praise the Lord are we together now so uh that that was that was the portion of it you remember Wednesday night I mentioned that I said I would talk about it but I realized that did not have time to talk about it that was one of the portions that we left up on left left left off on Wednesday night so uh we see here that the uh the the Commandment of the Lord was uh love the Lord your God with all of your heart amen all of your soul out of your mind and all of your strength when you bring it to the aspect of this sermon okay you bring it to the aspect of discernment you realize sometimes that uh children of God do foolish things amen and they make foolish choices but what happened how do we judge those foolish choices when those things are done it's a wow if that person was a Believer they would not do that you know we just we just go take the gun shoot them if that person was a Believer oh my God they would not do that I praise the Lord amen you look through the scripture you look through the scriptures I mean yeah I mean even even when you that's that uh that scripture that we read on Solomon when you read from the beginning of the scripture now Solomon there with the king of of Egypt and Marina and and Egyptian daughter and yes God coming to him right after a few verses after and God is dealing with him praise the Lord you see that's the reason why a prophet will tell us you got to look at you got you got to go inside God is is the god of the inside of the inside he's he's in the Shekinah Glory praise the Lord all of this year that uh you know it's the path to the one that dwelleth in the Shekinah Glory praise the Lord because if if we don't understand those things we would we we would judge or understand the way that God deal with us by how we feel no praise the Lord because the same way you can feel disappointed and feel funny and feel tired the people in the world feel the same praise the Lord you can feel stress the people in the world feel the same but the one that dwelled in the inside of the inside the joy of the Lord is our strength when that joy of the Lord comes when he when his presence is made known he lift us up above our stress he left us up above our frustration praise the Lord so he's he's he's trying to help us he's teaching us to realize that the Innova uh he dwar not in Temple made with hands and bother with that prepare me we hear the common saying you know uh uh we you get to that place where you get that feeling you you write in the in the valley of decision it looks like you feel to do this and and and and sometimes we say the other Hearts say I shouldn't do it and then one heart say I should do it praise the Lord it's an it's an inner dealing praise the Lord you feel in a well to do something and there is something also that is restraining you from doing it glory be to God how do we find out how do we make the judgment to know which one is right who make the call praise the Lord that's when the world becomes the two edges swore the divides that's when the word becomes the one that identified what is right no Abraham told us that we are getting into a dark of day he told us that the decks are going to be die he told us that the Letters Out of Hell and demon powers are streaming into the Earth that's what he told us that's why we realize that we have a greater battle on our hands we are not on a picnic amen we are not on a picnic to come and you know we are telling ourselves how our dresses look nice and how you look cute and we are on the battlefield it's going to be bloody people it's going to be bloody if we don't understand how God is dealing with us it's going to be bloody because if the devil can put you in a confusion amen he can put you in a confusion and get you limited to just the things that are happening to your mind and the things that your body is going through and can never make you to identify what your heart is Desiring what your heart is Desiring praise the Lord that's the reason why the the the the laodicia church can just pump the people with music and make them happy make them happy we bring them no word no word just make them happy then the next thing we'll pray for the sake we'll bring we'll bring Deliverance bunch of confusion praise the Lord and you see while also that's the reason why people get bored with the message they get bored because the message is what word praise the Lord oh we we spend more time preaching than dancing we spend more time preaching than singing the word must have the preeminence amen the world must have the preeminence he must have the first place it is because of him that we are here he's the one that we must spend much time around because I'm telling you the world can create a better atmosphere than the music can are we together in the midst of all of our trials where do we find the strength to be in church where do we find a strength what is the thing that is driving us amen how do we even love the Lord with all of our strength how do we even love him with all of our strength how do we love him with our mind when this mind is just blasted by the devil but that's what his word says love the Lord with all of your mind out of your soul and all of your strength you love the Lord that's the reason why Christian Life is a high calling is the greatest responsibility that you can ever have Joseph never knew he never had an idea that when he fell in love with Mary God was calling him to a higher calling he thought he just had he just had a wife and he was going to uh uh you know uh I mean he lost his wife and now he have a new wife he's going to regain his life oh praise the Lord the Bible said Joseph was a just man amen he was a just man and God found a man the right kind of a man that will be able to stand as a manager because he was going to bring Christ through this virgin he never needed a man that would leave her in a time of Crisis or leave her in a time when the reproaches come and people started to say all sorts of things about uh a marriage her name was in the hairline praise the Lord Mary became the insulting word when people want to talk to their daughters don't be foolish like married but God kept Joseph in the time of his widowhole God prepared him because he was a just man he was a man that loved the Lord he was a man that sector seek the face of God that God could come down and tell Joseph fear not to take marriage the same angel that spoke to Mary was the same angel that came to Gabriel I mean came to Angel Gabriel came to Joseph and said fear not to take Mary as the wife for it was time like this that's why I raise you up praise the Lord amen so you can see now he's going to he's going to be the one there trying to manage to keep this Christ shy he's going to be a a supporter he's going to Bear the reproach praise the Lord the reason why God raised us up for this age and time like this it's not for loudisha competition God raise you up because he said there will be a bride in this age there will be a people that will stand for his name in this age praise the Lord amen and until we understand that until we understand how he's dealing with us what are we raised up for praise the Lord until we understand that the Bible says there was a there was a serpent a more daily serpent that just wrapped around the hand of Paul and and all the people were saying my God that God is he looks like a witch praise the Lord and scripture says it will not even bother him he just shake his hand and shake the serpent off and that's the same thing that we must do to Believers to the devil when he bring things to our mind and our body going through shake it off it does not have anything to do with what God is doing in your soul praise the Lord I fall in short of uh uh uh uh paying my bills what does what does that have to do with you being the son of God allow allow these your church will tell you about prosperity and and they're pushing all of those things into into the head of the people that's how they understand God they are not wrong they are they are operating under the influence of their age their age is Rich but it's also miserable it's also naked it's also blind because they can see and understand those things that he's in the chamber of your heart Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord the things that job they Now understand going through all his trial you understand it praise the Lord amen and even though he did not understand it he never stayed Curse God because God was holy name he's the stronghold of our life praise the Lord Solomon wanted to understand everything and he did not even understand how he entered in adultery or idolatry he wanted to understand all everything under the sun but that was not David desire he said one thing hafa desired of the Lord and that I would seek after no matter what I'm going through I will seek after that I should do it in the house of the Lord all the days of my life praise the Lord I should do it in the house of the Lord unless we learn to start applying this word or as unless we learn to take this word this this was the word that created everything in the beginning Hebrew says everything the heaven and Herb Earth is hell by the word until we learn to start taking the word and applying the word do you realize how miserable we have been to be able to to to to produce a church with decent said produce a church with holiness you know how miserable we have been when we started lying our our children five says yes or less fast for everybody on hunger strike because we want to see the glory of the Lord when those innocent children just exposed to Spirits because we are Pentecostal we want to see the glory we want to see the power of God even the children have to fast you know how miserable we have been you know how many evil spirits will be packing um you are not safe from it you are not making the world your shelter if you are not making this world your shelter you are not safe from the spirits that are loose in the Earth the prophet of God said rock and roll is preparing the minds of our young people preparing their man for the blast and we see all that rock and roll infiltrating into gospel music and all of that just because they say Jesus look at the spirit that is behind it amen and even sometimes you want to be comfortable go and low cut look at the character that is singing that song pull them up look at the address code that's somebody that have all the all their body part peers yeah I want to sing it for entertainment that's all they are singing for make their money and live your life in a place of confusion praise the Lord because sometimes the god that they are singing to is not the god that you worship praise the Lord is not the god that you worship it's easy for them to say God it's difficult for them to see Jesus it's easy for them to say God because anything is God I'm not making this word your shelter if you are not feeding On the Border word of the son of man that's the only word that gives us Rapture in faith are we together you understood what I came from this morning praise the Lord we were not rightly discerned the body of the Lord because let's let things be happening in the church sometimes Lord God take his church through trials praise the Lord and people just sit back there and says well I mean there's nothing happening in that church sometimes the church goes through the the four the four anointings that time where the church fly hide Like an Eagle Revelation is breaking forth in the church God is blessing them with gifts the power of God is a monitor sometimes God will take his church through the ox where people will be having different trials and different sickness and different things when those Believers were dying giving themselves to die into the state God will stay with them God will stay God it was God that was giving them the grace for them to give their body to be burned sometimes God will take his church through immense anointing word the church will be taught on different doctrines and different things how to prepare themselves but because we have a poor discernment of the church Paul discernment of the body of the Lord I kept you too long then I then I thought I would have let the musicians come that's that's what always happened you try to do review then you preach more than you are doing reviewing all right he says let me just review all my subjects just make one point then you end up preaching seven different messages praise the Lord but I just wanted to grab from Wednesday night we were talking about uh the seventh spirit before the Lord and it brought us over to the Tabernacle the temple and I thought that I should just wrap the whole thing about what I wanted to make my emphasis on was uh uh those those just just understanding how God is dealing with us in this age praise the Lord just understanding how God is dealing with us is the word that is changing us is the word that is fighting our battles is the word that is keeping those evil spirits out you can deal with this age with your human understanding no matter how how advised you are in technology technology don't deal with spirits technology don't keep Spirits away [Music] [Music] praise the Lord [Music] let me say this and then I will close Moses said love the Lord with all of your heart all of your soul out of your mind [Music] but daily was led by the Holy Spirit last week and he was preaching and he was dealing with a family relationship husband and wife and he was dealing with all of that and he got to that place and talking about man love your wife woman reference your husband what I want for us to realize is that those things are not just laws and commandment of God those are things of God himself that he gives to us you will realize that love goes with worship [Music] love and worship goes together praise the Lord that's the reason why you cannot say that you love God and you are now worshiping him I mean worshiping him is not just your attendance in church no worship is more than that it's more than that worship is what you acknowledge amen is the most dominant thing on your mind foreign love the Lord [Music] fall in love with him Embrace his word [Music] even when his word is against [Music] your nature his word is against something you're struggling with love his word stay [Music] s the Lord because if you love God and you love his word Lord I love your word your word is truth speak to me Reveal Your word to me Thy word that word brings you into worship it brings you into obedience it brings you to a life of surrounding you don't have to struggle with it he says my burden I lighter let's stand on our feet and we can sing that now to the Lord I want to love you more more than ever before you are so easy to adore [Music] oh let's just sing it to him now Lord I Want to Love You More Lord I Want to Love You More ever than before you so easy to adore Lord I Want to Love blessing God lord I want to love you more oh yes Lord I Want to Love foreign [Music] thank you and I am a before [Music] seven years [Music] Lord I want to save you all I want to just Praise You Now Lord I Want To Praise You than I ever had before you so worried to be praised [Music] Lord I Want To Praise You I just want to know you Lord I Want To Know than I ever have been [Music] if you're so wonderful to know thank you Lord I Want To Know [Music] oh Lord I want to want to love you more thank you Jesus [Music] yes Lord okay you see those parts of our body that those those those elements those pockets of our body our mind our sword our spirit our strength is God that operates that score that operates if you can just bring yourself bring yourself bring your heart subject to the word and and just love the Lord just love the Lord [Music] sometimes we break into this place and uh and and then you we want to understand it and you know we we want to get it down to the letter no you you you will not be able to get this down that area of your life [Music] if it is honor the love of God the Bible says the love of God is spread about in our heart by the Holy Ghost it affects all those area he knows how to give us strength for the next day he knows how to deal with the talks and the warrior and the stress of our mind the word knows how to go in their Spirit reign of you [Music] he knows how to order your dreams he knows how to go there in your subconscious and deal with things that could be fearful that could be scary things that you don't want to talk about you don't want to think about it you don't want to remember it but because you are a human you can't forget but the word knows how to go down there and he can be able to pick those things up and sometimes the word will give you a consolation he will help you to understand and make you to realize For a Moment Like This For a Moment Like This for a day like this that's the reason why oh there is nothing about the word oh Father we just love you we just love you father I got caught up with this on my mind all through the night and just saying Lord I don't have my notes together but this will just not leave my heart and father we trust that you Lord God that you will come and use us as a vessel to deliver your word to your people oh God help us to see Lord help us Lord father to see to understand to realize who God that you are that God that that looks on us from the outward Lord because just like Samuel law father he wouldn't have chosen David looking from the outward father God he will he wouldn't have chosen that Shepherd boy but you told him you said I don't know George from the outward appearance we might be small in numbers we might be uh people that are not like uh this this world but father you look at the inward you look at the word that you have given us Lord father the mystery of God that being revealed law the opening of the seals Lord the things that you have helped us to understand and see it in this age of god father oh precious Lord father Lord you have given us strength Lord to be able to live for the name of Jesus Christ so God oh Father Lord God you have all God of precious Lord giving us your spirit Lord father to rise above the profession of this age to God to rise above for father Lord all the the the filthiness of God and the lies so Lord oh God even though the war against our mind we are exposed to those things so father Lord God by the word that we live in O God precious Lord the things that are all around us oh God but there is something of God that is holding us inside there is something that is Lifting Up The Name of Jesus Christ there is something that that is saying try for this moment you are born for this hour Lord for this day you have to stand like a Son of God stand like a daughter of God oh Father we just thank you we just thank you Lord we just thank you Father thank you Jesus father we love you and just as we have just
