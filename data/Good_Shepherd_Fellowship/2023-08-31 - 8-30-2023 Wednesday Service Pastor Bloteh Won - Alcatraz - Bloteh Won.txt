just play there softly and uh there's uh uh for Brother John BBE we want to bring uh that neede before the Lord just like I mentioned on uh Sunday I wanted to bring uh uh brother John B uh help me before the church and uh but I felt in my heart that I needed to talk to [Music] him you see because uh we are a body but yet uh people as individuals we are different there are things that we like there are things that we appreciate some people appreciate dealing with things in privacy some people uh would like to uh and and and just just just the way that we uh diverse so I wanted to be very sure that uh uh uh I I can talk to brother Jan bid I went to see him and and Sunday after church he's very strong in his faith he's uh uh able to move about walk around but uh for a period of time uh brother Jan baby has been dealing with uh uh a cancer tumor in his uh intestine it's an intestinal cancer and uh uh the the the heal situation uh the the doctors put in some stem and uh uh to help uh the floor uh things through his intestine bow movement and all of that but uh with the with the with the latest Doctor report uh the the tumor has has sred and and it's is in uh in stage four cancer and the doctors were supposed to remove the stem and clean it and place it back but they are very concerned uh because of uh the the the the growth of the tumor and uh so uh the last time he was in the hospital they couldn't do that and so we we want to bring this need before the church like I said to you on Sunday there are different things as a church that we've been dealing with uh some uh burden some uh concern and sorry to say some maybe don't care and some don't notice they just come in they just go out and uh but you see uh when when they end enemy [Music] come with an illness or he come with one attack on one or another and uh uh we for some time back we had young uh we have brother Dan son Joshua leading sons and uh and Dan STS to help in The Sound Room and and trying to work with uh uh the boys but you know that devil he never relent oh if we would just if we would just get a little bit of the devil courage we rebuke him we bound him but yet the next day he's in church and uh and and he's beginning to he he begin to trouble the boys and uh and uh uh afflect them with different things and and uh in Years brother Jan B also in this situation and I mean just different things I mean just different things so tonight I want for us to bring this neede before the Lord we will approach it by the way of prayer and and I'm I'm hoping I'm just waiting on the Lord praying and uh to see what he would do for us this weekend maybe the Lord might uh lead us and uh we bring our brother in and uh but we will let you know if there you happen how we going about to do it but I want us to just go to the Lord in prayer tonight and uh uh for the many of us that uh uh know brother John BBE over the years uh his wife sister Bei went to be with the Lord and uh uh year or two now

cleaning the church like a janitor even before he became a deacon and that was his time of prayer he he find that this was a place that he would come and spend some time with the Lord and uh so we just want to bring our brother tonight uh we want to bring our brother with found without fear without doubt believing that uh we are serving the god that is stay in the healing business believing that healing is the children's bread and uh so we just want to lift our brother Up This Moment by faith and and ask that the Lord would just move on the scene and and and and begin to strengthen the cells of his body and begin to deal with that uh cancer you know the prophet said it's a backslider cell the backslider cell is is what create cancer in the body how much more when a person is

he said unto him yeah Lord thou knowth that I love thee he said unto him feed my sheep praise the Lord the Lord bless you while we continue to read he said unto him the third time Simon son of Jonah love thou me Peter was grieve amen he was a man of short temper amen I don't know what was his height but his temper was short amen I hope he was not as short as his Temple amen amen Jesus said the third time Simon son of Jonah loveth thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time love thou me and he said unto him Lord thou knowth all things thou knoweth that I love thee Jesus said unto him him Fe man sheep now you see uh uh uh this is what happens sometimes with us we we we get we get so uh uh uh I don't want to say short temper we we we we we we cannot bed enough to be able to understand what was happening Jesus here was giv Peter an opportunity to redeem himself from his deny he he denied Jesus how many times three times and yet Jesus is asking him three times giving him an opportunity to redeem himself from his deny and and and he gets agitated why you asking me this you already know you know all things you won't embarrass me G praise the Lord but Jesus was actually giving him an opportunity to redeem him from his deny with no with no mistake Jesus purposefully I him three times just like he said Simon you will deny me three times is the god of Mercy he gave us opportunity all the time that's right praise the Lord but you see we we don't have endurance in us we cannot Bear Just just a little wine and we ready to give up and we ready to you know formulate our own our own way out and all of that are we together praise the Lord but I I I read that because I wanted I wanted us to to pay attention to that to pay attention to that that was that was God's mercy to Peter Jesus did not explain it Jesus did come back and say Peter I'm giving you opportunity to redeem yourself you deny me three times I'm making you to confess three times that I love you praise the Lord are we together amen but let's continue to read here because that that is not our subject for tonight verily verily I said unto thee when thou with young thou gather thyself and walth whether thou WTH but when thou shall be all thou shall stretch forth th hands and another shall guide thee and carry thee whether thou would met this speak he signifying by what death he should glorify God Jesus prophesying about uh uh uh Peter's death the way that he will be he will die the way he will be led and uh uh uh this speak he signify by what death he should glorify God and

loved following which also lean on his breast at serer and said Lord which is he that betrayed of thee John was the one asking this question Peter seeing him said to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do praise the Lord Jesus had just spoke to Peter and and prophesied to him told him about his future and he's looking at John and he's saying but what what would become of this other man what should it concern you praise the Lord amen and Jesus said unto him if I will that he T till I come what is there to do what what concerns you praise the Lord what concern you that uh this person has this

portion let's let's let's let's learn to have a grateful heart amen let's learn to have a grateful heart if there is one thing that we must ask God for every day God gave me a grateful heart I don't want to be ungrateful praise the Lord because there are a lot of things that he's working on your your behalf you have no idea about if I will that he T till I come what is there to the follow thou me I told you follow me what are you worrying about what will happen to the next people praise the Lord amen then when they saying AB brought among the Brethren there this disciple John should not die yet Jesus said not unto him that he shall not die but you see what happened the preacher say something the people the Freeman in the level of their understanding that ah he said John is not going to die until he come in his kingdom what was they thinking about they were thinking about the Millennium but Jesus was talking about something different he was talking about another coming and that is that coming on the island of pmos praise the Lord what is it to you that he don't die until I come Jesus was talking about the coming on the island of pmos and they were thinking about the coming of the Millennium which is the the David Throne the David Reign and the Bible says the same went among the disciples and they all start making their own saying that Jesus said he will not die but Jes Jesus said not unto him he shall not die if I will that that he T till I come that he TI till I come what is there today this is the disciple which testify of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is truth amen we know that his testimony is truth and the church says amen and and and and and there are also many other things that Jesus did the which if they should be written everyone I suppose that even the word itself could not contain the books there should be written amen you love the Lord tonight so we want to talk about that coming we want to talk about uh uh uh uh John fulfilling that that saying of Jesus praise the Lord fulfilling their saying of Jesus he he spoke about the end of Peter and he spoke about the end of John praise the Lord when he spoke about Peter and he says he says all will lead thee amen which mean they will lead you to crucification this man uh uh he's going to experience a coming of me not the millenum Reign but what if I I wait until he comes now so where where my mind is tonight with uh with the with a few minutes I want to be out here about 9:30 amen trying to make sure I uh uh uh discipline myself now to keep you above 9:30 so let the Lord come and help me tonight praise the Lord I don't want to get excited I just want to take it very easy tonight brother brand here says uh uh Revelation chapter 4 in the Revelation series he's talking about the he he says then John was summer up Summer to come up higher come up here which means come up year he show him all that was going to happen in the word of the church ages then after the church Ages was over we find then that John was a tith that's what I want for us to to to to to keep in our mind tonight John was the type can we read that together John was a type of every trueu believer amen John was a type of every True Believer that will be summered by Jesus on high which for us it will be the Rapture amen it will either be by the weight of of death or by the Rapture to come up high amen praise the Lord because if a person if if if a man Drop his body just dropped there but he goes up higher either way praise the Lord amen he don't drop there and go down and and look for another shortcut to go uh uh uh to to the sixth Dimension the body drops down he go up higher so either way we will come up higher amen praise the Lord so uh uh uh uh where where my mind is now now okay then he says also down here John represent the entire church was taken Tak up John represented the entire church was taken up I told you one person here in a vision can represent the entire body of Christ so where I want to go go with this tonight is that uh uh uh uh brother I'm talking on Revelation here but but uh where where the John representation of the Bride started amen where did his where did the representation he we always say John is a type of the Bride John representing the bride where did it start it glory be to God now yeah Jesus is saying to John uh what what if he TI till I come and and and and that that ties in with the promise of the Rapture there will will be a people that will TI till he comes are we together John experienc another form of coming then they that will be alive will also experience another form of coming Lord are we together amen are we together I don't want to loose you through those doors praise the Lord I'm trying to catch you I don't want you to go through those gos glory be to God amen y don't don't worry the trustees are working on it praise the Lord amen pretty soon you will start you will start complaining I'm freezing this place is too cold so don't worry about it pretty soon you will start complaining and you start looking for the tempo St everybody want to operate the tempo St just come come with a little jacket if it's hot you take it off it's cold you put it on I don't want to lose you through those go so let's stay together so you see here that John type of the Bride it is not just made up by brother Brandon but it's stripped her up John is a type of the entire rapturing church because Jesus giv him a promise that he's going to T to experience a coming of the Lord right so this is not a William Browner makeup it's a scripture of makeup are we together and if we together we say amen amen praise the Lord I told you I could preach on the convention tonight amen so as as as we look at that as we look at that I want to take I want to take another uh quote here A Part vision and uh and and and that will bring an introduction of what I want to talk about tonight part Vision brother says what condition then was this island talking about John now on the island of pmos what condition then was this island where was it and what the condition all right uh it's uh known in history as a rocket Island four of sep scorpions lasered and so forth is 30 mil uh uh tmis around it and in in Fort of rocks uh it was used in in the days of John as a Orchestra amen now h h h Sunday I was I was struggling over uh the name of a prison and brother Wesley called that the name of that prison now you see when I when I I was studying on this on the on the message uh praising of Jesus Christ I knew brother Brandon mentioned that you know you can you can pull that word out that that was one of America most notorious praising you can pull that word out you see he mentioned it several places so I had that in the back of my mind and I was I was I was trying to see how I can bring that uh uh into our subject about praising them so I'm going to try to do I'm going to introduce it tonight uh uh uh so here brother Brandon now this is the picture I want you to build brother Brandon identify John as a type of every believer John is not only a type of the ones that would be alive to Rapture but he said of all the church ages the Bride of every age right John typed the Bride of every age are we together am because you have to realize that he was he he he he he was he he saw the seven golden candles STI praise the Lord The Book of Revelation starts and says the the revelation of Jesus Christ that is the coming that John experienced the coming that John experienced was the revelation of Jesus Christ that was what Jesus was talking about so there is John a type of every True Believer a type of the Bride now he's placed on uh on the island of pmos and brother Brandon now is describing this island of pmos bringing it to h h h a place a notorious place here in the US so we can have an idea of what the island of pmos was praise praise the Lord are we together amen amen so he says here what was the condition of the place he says it's known in history it was a rocket place and that is the same way the uh aatr was called it was called a rocket rocket Mountain praise the Lord now it's a tourist place because the the the the government has closed down the the prison place there so people goes there just to see what it was amen so uh uh uh brother Jordan if you can help me with uh with our picture I wanted I wanted for us to have an an idea of what this prison looks like now according to history the earthquake in uh in 1906 that took place in California onum is buried in this ocean praise the Lord this place it looks like an island but it's it's it's also in its geographical position it's a mountain praise the Lord amen it's it's it's a mountain because the depth of this water is impossible to cross right [Music] so brother Bram giving us an an idea of how the island of pmos was it was an island he said yeah the uh we read earlier uh he said U come on now did he say Tedd M oh yes Tedd mil around which mean the the the distance from uh uh from the island to to shore amen so when a person was placed on that island there was there was no way of escape and it was it was it was it was known it was buil for notorious prisoners praise the Lord I will soon prove to you tonight how notorious you are amen your name is on held deathless praise the Lord your name is unhel wanted sir you are notorious that's right hallelujah praise the Lord and our our our our present state is like this place drive your car around enjoy your home but you are on an archestra praise the Lord and we have all of these things around us all of these waters are all representing demon powers demon powers and Demon influence praise the Lord when you are far away you look at this place just like you are looking at it now doesn't it look like a pretty place what you think about it if I never told you it was a prison would you think it's a pretty Place see it has a lighthouse amen it has a lighthouse glory be to God so that's what we want to look at T now we will we we we want to talk on the our catr so that's that's that's what we want to speak on so what what our mind is just like how John was placed on the island of pmos to receive the revelation of Jesus Christ that's the same where you and myself we are put on this loudish of praise we are in loudish of praison that's why we sing this word is not my home amen it's just a prison house amen praise the Lord you in a far better place because you have light you get water to drink you get grocery place in your praising place to God and you enjoy it and that's that's that's what happen with praising life people enjoy they become so comfortable they don't want to leave prais him because they can't they don't know how they can live out of prais him and that's how when men get so F bound enjoying the pleasure of this word they don't know how to live anywhere different right praise the lord we can't be F bound because we know there is a Promised Land we know there is a heaven praise the lord we know there is something more than work yes sir a land where we just praise God and worship God that's all we have to do that's what we look forward for praise the Lord oh we get a journey on this don't don't don't don't bother yourself I'm bringing an exposition to you I'm bringing an exposition to you praise the lord we get more time to travel on this let's take a little bit history of this place this place it was an island praise the Lord it uh a cat Island was a seabird habit when it was exploded in 1775 by Lieutenant uh uh one Manuel of the Spanish Army uh they they they discovered that place back in the in in in the 1700s they discovered that place then uh uh uh so it got his name that name that a got uh came from uh the seab birds okay Strange Birds so uh uh uh in our little history note year in 1850 uh by a presidential order the IR land uh uh was also used as uh Military Reservation amen the Indians also use the island the Indians use the island and uh for food but they also use the island uh uh to isolate anybody that was not wanting to believe or practice uh you know the the their their trouble thing if a person was an outcast they go they send them to the island you stay there you hle for yourself you die there because there is no there is no way out there is no land to walk you can't get on the bus you can't get on the train there is no airplane there for you to go to the airport praise the Lord so later on it it became known as as a federal praison amen so just like how the the island of pmos was a rocky place you can see by picture that uh that uh that place was a rocky place John placed on the island to receive this coming of the Lord the revelation of Jesus Christ concerning the future age what God will be doing in his future uh h h h h church are we together now so we see that uh uh uh here let's let's read pmo's Vision yet a little bit and uh uh so we can we can get a good good uh idea here brother B says it was 30 mil round it and four of rocks it was used in the days of John as uh a c a place where the Roman Empire aspired as criminals re by criminals in the in the Roman Empire it was the island of pmos in America at that time it was iatri P re by criminals if you go there you are just condemned praise the Lord and I'm telling you each and every one of you here in the mind of the devil you are condemned praise the Lord amen he sees Lisha like a net for you he see Lisha like a snail and whatever he can do to be able to crush you and be able to bound you and and and be able to make life miserable for you that's what he's going to do praise the Lord hallelujah let's just read this quickly and uh uh uh okay I try I try to keep my my my promise amen he says a place where the Roman uh Emperor will Aspire the uh uh as a criminal rebi criminal that they couldn't keep them in jail and so far you know so we we're not talking about Jailbreak now we're talking about a place where you go I mean you just you just say well I'm I'm yet I'm you know I'm I'm going to die and and that's how and that's how the rest of the world is they have they have no plan for the Millennium they are not thinking about a future home they are just living their life to stay right here and die right here amen but not the bride not the bride there were people that were on that island every day they were thinking about how to escape praise the Lord even though this place is surrounded by water but I believe I can break out of it yeah that's good amen and there were men in the natural that Tred it and I believe that God has a people that will have a praising break amen no matter what Lisha put around them they will be able to break out of it that's the kind of a people we supposed to be let me tell you people that that that planing prison break they are not Kess people right they are people that meditate yes sir they are not not in the prison jumping oh he he he hey oh no they are not dancing to every music that is played they are thinking how can I get out of here and if we are dealing things with with things in our life that should be our attitude not carried about with all of the the distraction that is around us that is called enjoyment in life we must be thinking how can I get out of here how can I get my family out of this situation how can I get my wife out of this situation my children my home how can we get this church to a better place in the world that's what we must be thinking about praise the Lord you see there there are some other people you know they are there they are there in prison I was just thinking about this thing I mean prison just been blasting my mind I've been enjoying it amen there are some people that the thing about it you know those selfish people they want to get out they keep it to themselves and you know what they try to do the in their mind now nobody will be watching me nobody know what I'm planning I'm just watching the guy on the tower the the guy that is on the tower with the gun as soon as he turned his back the other way I'm going to run and and jump over the fence and clim when those people do that you know what happened bullet straight in their back praise the Lord that's the attitude when people deal with things privately in their life you are just you will just run to a fence where the devil is going to crush you in the back yes sir read about read about any praising Escape that was successful it was never done by one man it was never done by one man there were people that sit down together no no no they argue but it was for a better cause yes sir they disagree but it was for a better cause when we argue and disagree it must be for the better cause not for selfish reasons not for selfish personal reasons we must be doing it because we want to be better don't worry I'll get you out of here by 9:30 don't worry that all amen if we can just get through this thing amen and that's that's that's why you find all of these people that they are jumping on the fence they will jump up with one high Revelation they will jump up then they come down the message is not truth they come down you know their home is all scattered they come down it's I mean it's it's all because they are looking for self praise self Glory selfishness praise the Lord when God Tau about his church the way he deal with his church was not individual the way he deal with his church was a body that's why Paul revealed to us in the communion that we are one body even as a family at home you are one bed and when the church grab that Revelation she become a successful Church praise the Lord the church word the pastor is spiritual more than all of the people he just come he rebuked the people you're not reading the message you're not even spiritual you're not praying and I mean he just he just frustrated because he feels like he's the only one God told Elijah I get 7,000 that not even bow down to Bell don't think you are the only man you're not the only Pebble on the beach God still have children that believe in Divine Healing God still have children that are experiencing the Supernatural and uh these girls are uh uh unmarried and and Rachel they came to me in the office after after this gone Sunday and they were just testifying to me about about their mama you know while uh uh back home there you know this the their mother had someone that help her with you know uh cleaning the yard and all of that and and the old man was doing that and and I think he climbed on the ladder to trim uh uh uh the flowers and he fell at the back of his head she heard the sound she ran out and he was he was lifeless in his body out of nervousness she I mean she started shouting praying and doing everything to revive the man prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus and crying to God and her children all standing around she even went down and gave the man CP Arrow praise the Lord out of desperation where until you get desperate you will know what is in you amen praise the Lord amen your your desperation will either drown you or your desperation will raise you up amen she got so desperate and I mean she was doing doing all of that and and crying to God and praying and you know and and and just crying God you know save this man and and and and and and uh uh uh after a little while it looks like the children saw a movement in his body and it C her attention to that and and and she realize okay I think I think he's moving and they Rush him to the hospital when they went to examin the the felt like because he felt in the back of the back of his head there could be bleeding in his brain so they wanted to do serery and uh uh you know to to look there and see and see what was what was going on and I think I think she and her husband got a little bit concerned because she she lost her mother from a brain surgery so it kind of gave her a a reflex on that and and they didn't want it to do that but uh by the grace of God the old man is sitting up talking and he's doing well praise the Lord amen she was at she was at home alone I mean it was not a church there it was not in church it was in her home praise the Lord and that's a housewife she had to put her faith to work and God honor her faith God honor her desperation that's what we talking about God her desperation we always looking for somebody to blame lot of those days are over people amen so BR Braham says here he says uh you know it was a jail and and it was full of all of that thing they put them out there on the island to die that's that's what the island of pmos was that's the same way this this this praising you know archestra that's what it was for it was for praisers to just go there and die go and enjoy just stay there enjoy yourself die just you you die we not bringing your body back and to for your parents to bury you you will stay right there you die it's a rock it's it's a rock place so guess what my guess is that they just chunk their body right there into the water and this that that that place is fill filled up with sharks praise the lord it's fill up with sharks I was I just reading through one of one of the documentary there on on that place and it's it's it's amazing you know that uh uh uh uh the person that wrote that documentary was commenting on it the person said the next great earthquake that will hit California maybe un arra will be the place of survival I said oh my praise the Lord it survived 1906 it survived the earthquake in 1906 I think there was another one in 1984 it survived that one also praise the Lord there was some people that survived Ephesus Church age there was a bride that survived semar Church age there was a people that survived terit Church age people survived Philadelphia Church age amen there were people that survived Sidis Church age there rais a people that that will survive laisha Church age praise the Lord amen I'm just warming up on this don't worry it's a Wednesday night he says let them let them stay there until they are dead question the reason why John was there the reason why a Godly Man a righteous man a a man of good repetition good character never in trouble why why was this man there the Bible says for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ if there is one reason why you are here in laition Edge is for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ if there is one reason why you are surrounded with all of the things you are surrounded is for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ you take your eyes off there you be lost you never find your way out it's for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen this uh H praising have a history there were there were two men there there there there among the among the many there was there was there was one that also testified and uh uh uh you know he said says he says he says every day we look over those wordss the thought comes to our mind of escaping he says but uh when you think about you think about the the ocean you are condemned praise the Lord there were two men that that uh that that that uh tried to escape and uh they got they got they got out of the praising and and won uh you know he uh was able to swim and went on the on the Little Rock you know and then he was you know waving to the God and and tell him come okay if you can come and find me come and find me but you know what that the story was there for them for him to be able to swim uh across the river to the land when he got to the land there was no life left in Him Praise the Lord he tried all his swimming skills there was just no strength no life left in him they came and pick him up pick both of them up and return them back to their prison cell praise the Lord see that's that's what the devil is doing in this Edge carrying people back and and and praising them uh uh uh to this to this pring word the lust of this word and the evil of this word praise the Lord taking them back you know and and and that's that's what brother Brandon would say that yet he says he says this there in uh humble their self he says it's it's it's just like K dos fighting see you know more about how to take a hold of him uh uh uh uh you don't jump there you know and and and he's going to stret you up see know his tatics these guys who are that that is looking for the prison break they they got to steady there were there were there were three men also that uh that 1962 that had another prison break until yet history don't know if they died or they were able to swim their way to land tell you more about that later now to tonight praise the Lord but you see you see what brother B says he says it's it's it's not it's not just jumping and you know and and and being excited and no it's not about excitement you got to study your environment you got to study your environment if you understand it if it struct you and you realize that this world is not my home this place is just a training base this place is just a prison house praise the Lord if you understand there then it it it it leads you to the place where you steady your environment when things are happening or you know things are moving and and you think that it's not you take a step are we together he say it's just he said it's just like a COR dog fight you just don't throw the dog in there just going to stretch and tear him up see know his Statics watch him what he does and we learn more about the enemy so we have got to find out all of his techniques and and how how he approaches and what he does and learn his punches then you are trained to go in on him praise the lord we have to learn it sit back are we together it was it was it was a very very very very very notorious place they had to close the prison down because it became too expensive for the government to uh to be able to take care of according to the figure we got there it required almost about3 to5 million to be able to take care of the the praising down to sustain the place provide food and every other thing that they needed there so yeah brother BR is is is typ John today you know that was that was just a beautiful catch and I I really enjoyed that it just it just it just play out in my mind the entire day he typing John you know uh uh John being on the island of partos receiving the revelation of Jesus Christ and and that's that's the three for purpose that's what this message is all about is the revelation of Jesus Christ God revealing himself in you amen in that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me it's not just all about you know church and church member no how are we going to get to that place you know when I mean we we uh uh I mean uh uh I mean we we need to wake up ourself praise the lord we need to get to the place where we where we are in communion with the father he's revealing to us the purpose why we are here why we never came in the days uh in in Bible days he put us in this age for the purpose we talk about the byass our ton so we can come here to be tested are we together this word is not my home see that's that's that's praising you you you you got to play you got to play nice to everybody for them to accept you amen if you stand against their all to beat you so you got to play nice you become everybody fool when they say this you say oh yeah it's fine they say this oh yeah it's fine you don't have no stand praise the Lord cuz you are afraid for you to be for you to be WIP or stop or or to take your food from you and and all of that that's what make the church is just a poor example because we miss the purpose while we are here it's time for us to take a stand with the word praise the Lord I mean not being arrogant and going out there and insulting people and you say you're preaching the gospel that's not what Jesus told you to do he told us for us to be saled for us to have a life that people will see and get tested and the better way for you to get salty is on your knees you got to build a prayer life it got to be a consecrated life not just a put on life what you can put on and take off no it got to be a consecrated life are we together praise the Lord I kep about some other the thing on the prison break year uh for now so uh yeah I just I just take this take this once you know brother BR talking here yeah let's let's just read this read this and we we will close on that uh uh if we can take uh the S and secret going away let's take that quote on the sing secret going away and then we will we will close the whole thing here brother bam says here some time ago I guess many of you people who who travel has been there have stayed all night there many times in my journey out west which uh uh I have to go next we and and and and relieve myself now he's going to go into into this thing where the government was against was was coming after him for paying taxes and uh so he's going to go into that but he's going to bring a comparison here so that's that is that is the purpose of this so we can be able to grab it praise the Lord he says uh uh I'm going to go you know to the West uh uh get relev from the government to go you know he have to ask ask the government so they know that he's not running away they are holding in year where if uh if uh they send me away they could uh get me right here and I have I have got to go to a couple of meetings over to the West Coast and the Lord willing I passed through this little city called West Memphis uh arer it just across the river from Memphis Tennessee you know that's that that is the area of anti jamama if you if you just pick put the picture together so he says here and uh uh in this place they wanted to spend two And1 half million for uh a race cost for gambling two uh uh and half million two and a half 5 million to degrade and to pollute and to send souls to hell and then they will catch men like bigram and over and myself and those who are suffering for the cause of Christ to pass uh uh ilg uh money through a church and want to give them 20 years in federal praising it's um always been uh the word of the word to like that amen so he's comparing that y said the government want to spend this money you know for gambling and all of that and then brother Braham says you know and they coming after us preachers you know and he says you know we are not paying tax and all of that but watch the story now where it gets beautiful that's not what it gets beautiful he says uh I have brothers who have been in federal prison he's going to take all of these Bible character and one and one of the attorneys said you got Brothers in federal prison he said yes I did said who were they I said one of them was called John Amen on the Outland of pmos but he called it in in arest you know brother BR has a way of talking to to kind of for uh uh trap people mind amen praise the Lord he said on the island of pmos and the other one was called Paul in the Roman federal prison and Daniel he was also in the prison house and Brother Joseph because uh uh uh that he had been accused of something that uh he was innocent serve years by trying to be a real servant to portify and his wife accus him and he was condemned and laid in prison for years until his whisker and his hair grew out you know uh as you read the story you don't pick it up but you go back in the book of Psalm the Bible say he was in shackles praise the Lord he was in shackles our owner shackles is not chained around our hands amen we are bound with with just like just like BR Braham says you know Satan uh uh being loose and being bound is a chain of circumstance our want change that is change of situations praise the Lord their chains were literal chains our chains are change of situations we are bound with different situations all around us it's always one or the other amen so yeah he was bound and he laid in prison for years until his wi and the head grew out even had to shave him to take him before Pharaoh show what was uh anything wrong for the cause of Christ he identified ing all of these guys going to praison because of the word of their day because of the purpose of God for their day and the purpose of God for this day also have to be manifested in the bride in the people praise the Lord this is not just church making people it's more than Church making because one of these day we come close to that time you know uh uh uh uh and you know and that's that's word you know uh I'm trusting the Lord to to kind of bring it out where where you be able to see you know the persecution and the squeeze they turn to look the same but they are not the same the Bible says all them that take the name of Jesus Christ will suffer persecution that is to all believers but there is a people that will be squeezed to produce the literal life of Jesus Christ yes sir there will be a bride that will be squeeze praise the Lord when we entertain ourself with little compromise here and little compromise here always trying to find a way that to justify ourself this that I mean at that time there will be no character in you to bear that there will be no character in you to bear that when there is no pressure on us yet we stay try to find little shortcut here and little shortcut there while if it's pressure come there will be no character in you to be able to bring for that Life of Christ that's why that word squeeze is useful it's a portion that is kept for the brde where she will be squeezed and Christ will be on the scene just like shedra mishad and they were squeez even if our Lord don't deliver us we will not bow down that was a squeeze all the religion people all the Jews in the land were buying down they stood right there they say we are not buying down even if God don't deliver us but you see they were squeezed into a foric seven time he and what came out of it the son of man was identified with him that even the king could see there were four men in the fire that's what that moment is all about praise the Lord it's not because I want to buy iPhone I don't have money or I'm going through persecution that to buy iPhone that persecution praise the Lord because you want you want iPhone so you going that is that why you call persecution B said they were all on the island for the ca of Christ let's pay attention to that you know let's pay attention the things that we deal with the way we deal with faith when we trust God it it boasts our confidence because we need to grow daily in trust we need to grow daily we says he's an everpresent God we need to grow Experiencing God coming on the same praise the Lord Experiencing God coming on the sin and that's what I'm trusting that God will do for uh our brother John BBI amen that God will come on the sin praise the Lord amen that God will come on the s i i I'll speak more than that uh uh uh on the weekend so let me let me not take all the time I have 10 minutes here so brother I'm talking about this and he's giving these different testimony Joseph and all of these people place here he says and then spend $2 and5 million for a race cause to pollute and and them and send souls to Hell talking about God coming quickly see what brother BR say he says but the Arkansas people at that time they did something about it every church he said I think now or 10 different denomination of them in the community he says all they all got together and he said it was wrong praise the Lord and they won't have it and they form a prayer meeting and they take a a prayer chain day in day day day in and out night in and out and when the Jorge and the federal men and and and they all went to the court the next morning to settle it he said whether they could build it or net the went in met he says and it was defeated prayer changed things amen I don't care how rotting the world is how rotting our country is how rotten the nation is our people our prayer change things amen praise the Lord God is more than able he's a God the answer prayer if we would just discipline ourself and learn to just take things to the Lord in prayer earnestly Lord I don't know I don't I don't know what to do I give it to you I'm committing it in your hands praise the Lord and wait let the Lord help you before you start figuring it out and start and no no no no you give it to the Lord wait on him Lord give me understanding Lord give me Grace because prayer change things what is a prayer what is a prayer chain it's just a disciplined time that's what Daniel did Daniel had a prayer chain he never needed a 20 person he had his own prayer chain because there was an appointed time every day that he met an appointed time that's what prayer chain is it's either I I decide that will meet at appointed time or we come together and says well let meet six let's meet 9 let's meet 12 at that time we know that somebody will be praying because the the scripture say when two or three agreed on anything even husband and wife can have a prayer chain and says well we are trusting the Lord for this let's let's let's put it before the Lord you know let's meet uh in the morning let's meet at the set time what whatever time you you want to but it's a sense of discipline a sense of commitment a sense of devotion and B BR says those people got together and they pray that spirit away from the place they defeated it in court and I believe that as a church we can be able to defeat things that are rising around us that sh not praise the Lord amen it don't have to be a public thing a brother and and and and and and his wife can come together and says well you know I don't know what what's actually going on but I think there's a need in that family let's let's pray for them you don't need to blow it over the building that's right you don't need to pour postard all on the street if you do that you're just looking for self Glory right but you are praying and you are watching you are just trusting the Lord and you see things happening if we don't if if we don't learn to come to that place of of of some sense of of self discipline where we can be able to keep things before the Lord and keep our heart before the Lord I mean that's how we grow in character to trust the Lord amen you realize that uh we are so loud about the things that we are complaining about amen when there supposed to be things that we are trusting God for we get so loud about it no some things you just got to take it before the Lord see the hand of the Lord musicians you can come up tonight praise the Lord like I said don't worry we on this praise we on this praising thing got to get our Prison Break amen we got to get our prison break
