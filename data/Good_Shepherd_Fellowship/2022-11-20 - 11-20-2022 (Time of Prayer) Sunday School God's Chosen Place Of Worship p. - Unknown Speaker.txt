TRANSCRIPT
========================================
seated walked down to put his arms around me and he said these words brother Branham I hope this don't sound sacrilegious but said that could be made the 23rd chapter of Revelations which is only 22 chapters in Revelation he said I hope this don't sound sacrilegious he had no more and said it now the boy was a Baptist and know nothing about the supernatural with his arms around me he started talking in an unknown language and when he got through speaking in an unknown language there was a heavyset dark woman sitting right in front of me she raised up said I don't need any interpretation she said I'm from Shreveport Louisiana or Baton Rouge Louisiana said that is purely French Victor Leduc which was a Frenchman also sitting up there said certainly I'm a Frenchman and that was perfectly French I said wait a minute you write down what he said and you write down what he said before you say anything write down what you're saying let's see your notes and so one wrote down and the other wrote down it was even the punctuation was the same and then just about that time when they brought the notes up a fine looking young blonde-headed boy come walking from the back with not enough room for him to sit down he was standing up in the back he'd come walking forward so just a minute I'd like to place a note too he said I am the French interpreter for the U.N United Nations he said I like to leave mano and here are all three notes exactly the same a French and here's the way it reads this is the original notes take a note taken right off this is Danny's naughty self he packed in his pocket of course it went into Christian business and so forth because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise uh decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass their tremendous victory in the love divine now the man signed his name here the above statement was interpreted by of Danny Henry prophesying over brother Branham given by three Witnesses in the um cafeteria in Los Angeles California now this same young man that give this prophecy not knowing what he was seeing was in Jerusalem about a month ago he had the privilege of going out and and laying in the tomb where Jesus had died and was buried and so while he was laying there he said I come upon his mind real strong and he started weeping said how that it has been so hard for brother Branham to stand against the world in these things in all churches that is it was once said of one of the Billy Graham parts that we can see Billy Graham because all churches in United together for him we see Oral Roberts the Pentecostals but how do we ever have anything was contrary to what people have been taught it's gone and Danny what he does for a hobby he makes little Stones he walked out to where the cross had been put down where they said the cross set in the rock no one was around so he broke off a little piece of Rock and he put it in his pocket for a souvenir come home and maybe a pair of cufflinks out of it and strangely when he made them they looked to be blood-stained and right through each one of them in continuity runs a straight narrow path right through both of them now that might be just um uh see someone else might not notice it but to me it's complementary to the things I believe I believe that everything has the meaning to it and now in this time whatever the Lord has if this isn't the thing that he prophesied of a Malachi for and of also of Luke 17 and many other scriptures that's to happen in this last day may I say this in closing it's laid the foundation for the man when he will come so I am very thankful that God Almighty if it's be that way has let me do a little something in my uneducated condition to show my appreciations of his love to me my love to him and our love to the people therefore in sincerity I approach this subject of marriage and divorce may God have mercy on us all amen and now listen closely and sisters don't get up and go out set still just a little while Brothers do the same don't turn off your sets out there that's coming on this hookup don't do that just sit still for a few minutes until it's over listen closely if you disagree put down the scriptures that I use and then study them prayerfully before you make your decision God help us as we try to approach this subject now it may be a little lengthy I don't want you to be in any hurry and uh just take your time all of us and study the word of God truly and thoroughly as we know how to study let's begin with Saint Matthew the 19th Chapter and beginning I think with the eighth verse of the 19th Chapter I wish to start I might start also with the first and read down to the eighth verse of the 19th Chapter now remember these things that I say must come from the word of God it can't be my own opinion because my opinion just like anybody else's but it's got to be in continuity with the word of God remember God keeps everything in continuity he never changes he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he's the same now I shall read from the 19th Chapter and he came to pass that when Jesus had finished these things he departed from Galilee and came into the coast of Judea Beyond Jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him I pause there so you get the emphasis on who it was that was tempting you saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them in the beginning made them male and female and said for this call shall a man leave father mother and shall cleave to his wife and they tween shall be one flesh therefore they are no more tween but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let not man put asunder they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and put her away and he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wise but from the beginning it was not so now God help us this scripture this question confronted Jesus at the very beginning of his ministry and it confronted Moses at the very beginning of his ministry it's a foremost question and believer's hearts The Sinner doesn't care but it's two Believers because the believer is trying to do all that he knows how to do to live right before God therefore it any question comes up on religion then the marriage and divorce case comes up why because it is the cause of the original sin that's where sins started and that's the reason it's brought up every time because it is the very beginning of sin now I won't have time to explain all these things but I'll be glad to answer your letter or anything of Canada we got the books wrote on it and many questions and even cuttings out of newspapers and things here to prove this we know that it was Eve the Apple that you were supposed to eat or it's not even scriptural now they claim it was an apricot it was neither one she committed adultery in it brought forth the first child which was Cain Satan's own son or in him laid evil it did not come through Abel Satan's son was Cain I know your question now he said I have gotten a man from the Lord that's exactly right you could take the honoriest woman in the town the worst man if they had a baby you would have to come from the Lord because God has Law set together and these laws like the Sunder age you put a of bird in a good field it'll grow and it has to grow because it's God's law when seed is planted it must grow and nothing can grow life but God because it operates under his laws therefore when the evil seed was planted in the womb of of Eve it had to bring forth because it's God's law a production and he could do nothing else but bring it and it had to come from God that's the reason people say little babies sometimes it's not born with Christian parents are lost Jesus Christ's blood got tones for the child I don't care how much it was born how evil it was born he's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world a little child cannot repeat because it has nothing to repent for and that was the sin of the world which was taken away by the blood of Christ babies go to heaven its original sin and that's the reason it's it's question when any great phenomena comes from God about the first thing what about marriage and divorce now as ever it still is a question amongst the people as it was in the times of Jesus as it was in the times of Moses it's always been and is to this day a question among the people because the people want to know what's the truth but where there is a question there must also be an answer and now being an answer as I have said before this week there must be a correct answer and if we get an answer to anything and it uh it isn't right uh then we know that it was wrong but there's we're still asked to tell the true question is answered if you want to know truth and being this is a Bible question it should be a Bible answer is like I've said if I wanted to go East this morning and the best that I know this I had to find a certain something in the field it was directly east and I went East somebody said brother Branham this is East it is East potentially but it's Northeast I would pass the very object I was looking for I'd come back knowing it was wrong and then if somebody said brother Bram go this way to your right now that is potentially East also but it's Southeast I would lose the object that I was looking for because I went beyond the boundaries of the perfect and direct way now if that be so we have two schools of thought on marriage and divorce and that is one of them says that a man can only be married once unless his wife is dead that's one of the questions but you go to following that you go overboard and then the next says oh if the wife or the husband either one has committed adultery either one of them can be put away and married again you find yourself overboard with that so see it's neither south east or North East we won't directly east you run out of scripture when you go this way you're out of scripture when you go that way we want to know where scripture meets scripture I know what's the truth of it each takes a different way and failed to bring up the correct answer but there still must be an answer it's just like today there's two great schools of Doctrine in the church one of them is Calvinism the other is our myth armenianism one of them is legalist the other one is Grace and we come to find out that the people who believe in grace the Calvinists they say bless God it don't hurt me to smoke it don't hurt me to drink I can do these things I've got eternal security then we find the other side on the legal he said oh I would like to ball him out I'd like to show him a piece of my mind but I'm a Christian I have to keep still see you find yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is right now that's hard to say that but it is the truth we find ourselves on two different roads one going one way one another now let's see what truth is now listen and see if this sounds sensible to you for instance if I get ready go overseas I'll take my own family I'll call my wife up to me and I will say uh we're go I'm going overseas dear now here is the legalist sign now my wife I'm going to lay the law down to you if you flirt with any man while I'm gone when I come back you're a divorced woman and I don't want you making eyes don't want you flirting you understand that I'm your husband if you do it I'm going to put you away you want to come back then she reaches and gets me by the time say my good man I want to tell you something that if you make eyes with any woman or take any woman out or flirt with any woman you're going to be a divorced man when you come back I wouldn't that be a happy home that's the legalism all right now the other side is that if I go overseas and uh make a mistake go over and say when I look I'll take this woman out oh it's all right [Music] foreign [Music]
