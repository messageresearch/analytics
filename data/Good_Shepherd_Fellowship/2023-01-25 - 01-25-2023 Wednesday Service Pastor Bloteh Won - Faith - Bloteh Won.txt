thank you for the music efficient we stop on the bulk of Ephesians on Sunday let's trust the law to be able to pick up from where we stop praise the Lord God bless you thank you for eign are your hearts tonight I will go to Ephesians chapter 6. I will I will very familiar Warrior scripture I Will Baptist scripture Ephesians chapter six let's read from verse 10 and then we will we will do a little bit of a review here Ephesians 6 reading from verse 10. finally my breadwinns be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God their yea may be able to stand against the wise of the devil for We rise or not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the ruler of Darkness of this word against spiritual weakness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil thing and having done all to stand praise the Lord stand therefore having your learned guilds about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet show with the with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shed of Faith where wave ye shall be able to quench the fairy doubts of the devil or the wicked sorry and take the hairmad of salvation um in the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praise the Lord praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there until with all perseverance and supplication for all sins praise the Lord father bless your word tonight and bless the continuation father of your thoughts upon our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat we started we closed on the efficient strolling through efficient and as we as we said let's let's take out uh let's take a coat here that would be uh the one and only that we will read for the night and we make reference to few others brother Branham in adoption he says this he says and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are praise the Lord another place he also says until we know what we are doing amen so we can never rightly be able to have faith now now what what will be their faith it will be your uh uh the fate of a manifestation of a Son of God Amen for us to be able to rightly have faith the prophecies we we have to be positionally we have to know what we are knowing what we are who we are and also what we are doing amen now he goes down he talks this he says and then if God has sent us to be his ambassadors praise the Lord all the powers that's in heaven all that God is all of his angels and all of his power stand behind our word if we are correctly and ordained not claiming praise the Lord now that we are claiming now for us to be uh uh rightly ordained we have to know that we are rightly ordained we have to know that God had predestinated us to be in this age that it is not by chance that we are here now you see so that's what he he made the statement that he made that we read first we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are we have to know that we are ordained for this hour this day that we are in praise the Lord amen we are going to be here tonight on this prayer meeting he says if God has sent us to be his ambassadors do we believe that he has sent us can we say Amen praise the Lord can we identify with that then he says then we must believe that all power that in heaven all that God is and and all of his angels and all of uh his power stand behind our word I mean every word that we have prayed tonight everything that we have asked the Lord we we have to believe that knowing I mean uh who we are what we are and and what we are doing what we are here for it stands behind uh our words if we are correctly ordained and ordain send messenger to the people God has to honor his word for he has so suddenly written there whatsoever you burn on Earth that will abound in heaven praise the Lord and we we have to realize that word bound means establish praise the Lord and uh the church word in most places have limited that word to bounding Satan and bounding devil and other things but it also means that whatsoever we establish whatsoever we agree if we agreed as a church to keep seen out of our mess we can do it praise the Lord if we agreed as a church to have a healthy church we can do it and that's what we'll be we'll be dealing with a little bit here in in Ephesians chapter six whatsoever we bound on the earth that will abound in heaven whatsoever you lose on Earth that will uh loose in heaven amen we can lose the liberty of the spirit amen we can lose gifts among ourselves we don't have to limit ourselves we can lose for the Holy Spirit to have the Liberty whenever we come here I mean we can see his presence and and it all depends on us is whatever we Bond whatever we establish as a church whatever we also lose as a church we do we're dead on that a little bit when we were talking about bounding powers in heaven and I gave unto you the Keys of the Kingdom oh such great promises he's given to the church can we say Amen can we identify with that that's our promise such great promise he gave to the church so a little bit of a review we were talking on the Sunday uh traveling through the book of Ephesians now uh we talk about uh Ephesians chapter one how God has has uh you know Paul uh letting us know that uh he has blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places I call him as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the word that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us that chapter 1 verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself I call into the good pleasure of his will so those are things that God did before even there was a word before even there was a devil so the devil can stop this praise the Lord God predestinated he he choose you in him amen that you can be that that you should be holy and without blame that you should walk in the love of God he did all of this before even there was a thought of a devil praise the Lord so the devil cannot stop this amen now so we realize that this this is what God did he you know he he predestinated us onto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ I call him to he that the good pleasure of his will the good pleasure that was God pleasure it pleased the father to to place Us in the age then we went over to chapter two now Paul is bringing us uh uh into our first birth he bringing us into uh we all being born in sin and cheaply iniquity verse 1 chapter 2 and you have he quickly who were dead in trespass and sin we're in time pass you walk I calling to the cause of this word I call into the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now working in the children of Disobedience we know the prince of the power of the earth is the devil amen so Paul here is saying on our first birth we were under the influence of the devil The Same Spirit that is now working in the children of this obedience was once working in US but God has quickened us meaning that he has left us above that praise the Lord so there is an expectation when a quickening power comes he expects us to rise above our weaknesses now so he he he he he he shows us the nature of our first birth and then he gets down to verse eight he says uh for by Grace I ye is safe true faith and and that's not of yourself it is the gift of God not of work leads any man she bought so he now make us to know that Grace has saved us now Grace has saved us chapter three he's going to make us to realize that this grace that has that have come unto us praise the Lord has placed Us in the family of God amen trying to find a good place to read here let's let's look down here in uh and then you can go ahead and it's just how to pick one verse because all the verses are good now verse 11 I call him according to the internal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and Ashes with confidence by the faith of him wherefore wherefore I desire that year faint net at my tribulation for you which is your glory for this course I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is name I mean that's the reason why uh you know the scripture make us to know there is no other name giving on the heaven whereby we can be said because this is the family name the scripture identify it that's the reason why our baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you see how Paul lay it out it is very important for this cause I buy my knees to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is name so after Grace has saved us Grace introduced us into this family word uh uh uh chapter 4 verse 4 there is one body one Spirit even us ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God the father of all who is above all and true all and in you all praise the Lord Hallelujah so after we've been introduced into into their family we take on the name of of God and that's that's what makes us an ambassador because heaven heaven has us has uh has has adopted us as children we are bearing the name of God then he brings us here now into chapter four uh uh we're just doing a review here I want to bring you to something tonight now over here in chapter four uh we realize now God brings us on the the protection and also the guidance of a faithful Ministry a fight for Ministry that is liking to the the that is likened to the cherubins around the throne amen we know that the fight for Ministry is locking on to the man the ox the ego and uh and the lion those those four anointing that is around the throne so this fight for Ministry each of those Ministry are identified honor one of the nature of uh of those uh of those beasts around the throne you know brother Brandon make us to know that uh the prophet and the Evangelist is under the ego's anointing praise the Lord amen the prophet and the Evangelist is under the ego's anointing the Evangelist he can he can just you know he can go that speed you know rebuke sin and and therefore and the prophet can also go as far you know into the heavens and he can see it and foresee things now it is very is very very uh uh peculiar and a blessing because in our age God sent us a prophet that have an evangelistical Ministry burbanon office was a prophet but he operate that gift as an evangelist praise the Lord and that's the reason why he says I was never a successful pastor praise the Lord now so we we see that the prophet and I'm not I'm not teaching under the oh I'm not teaching on the fight for Ministry I just I'm just creating uh I thought as we passed through here so the prophet and the and the evangelists operate under the ego's anointing the man is the teacher praise the Lord the teacher that God will bless him with uh with uh uh wisdom we know that the pastor is the ox of the team he is the bearing the bird and Bearer amen he is the ox of the team you know so we have the pastor there the arks of the team we have uh uh the men's anointing that is there with uh with the teacher we have uh the the the ego anointing and the umbrella Brandon will let us know that the lion anointing is also with the missionary which is the apostle praise the Lord he's the one that goes out he's the one that that these with beasts at Ephesus uh so so that's that is that is your fight for Ministry so God just like the the Tabernacle we show you that picture of Israel Tabernacle and and you know the full uh anointing was around the Tabernacle so God uh bring us when he saved us he bring us under the protection all those faithful Ministry so you see it takes the fight for Ministry to bring us to perfection praise the Lord and that's the reason why we tried as best as we can to be able to expose you to different Ministries you know as they come through our way because that's what it takes to bring us to Perfection is therefore our our protection and it's also there for our Perfection meaning there to bring us to maturity like Paul says here he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting all the saints there's chapter 4 verse 12. for the working of the ministry and for the early firing of the church till we all come to the unity of the faith and to the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man onto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ so he warn us God wants us to grow that we hence for be no more children because when God brought the first Son of God he was not a baby he was not a baby praise the Lord he was not a baby when he brought the first Son of God When God says let's make man in our image it was a man show man amen it was a man it was a son Adam that uh uh you know God expressed him in that uh in that in that uh other state in that Manchester so uh you don't want us to be tossed about like children you want us to grow like and and to be uh Sons and Daughters now so they are the five for Ministry is to bring us there then as Paul goes on talking about all of these things he comes over to chapter five and he starts dealing with uh uh verse 1 be be therefore followers of God as their children and walk in love as Christ also have loved us and has given himself an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smell and silver but fornication and all uncleanness and conversa it now be one's name among you has become Saints need of filthiness no foolish talking meow he's really getting into uh our spirit man let me say that way now he has brought us into the body he has brought us and and exposed us to this to this uh uh protection that we have which is a faithful ministry under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh so now he's going to start dealing with our spirit men bringing us to a place here and as he goes on talking about this he you know you can you can read you know all the the the verses there for this you know there are no warmongers known unclean person or Converse man uh who is an idolater have any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God let no man deceive you within words for because of these things come at the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience and he goes on and on and on and then uh pretty soon he's coming now to let us to see that as God is with us uh uh uh uh being saved by grace and uh and the fight for Ministry is there you know teaching us and guiding us is bringing us where to to a relationship with God praise the Lord now he's going to as he goes on with there then he gets into the family life now the reason why we read Ephesians chapter 6 to 9 for our scripture reading is to let us to see that all of these stages in our life all of these things that God by Grace have exposed us to we will have to fight for them praise the lord it's true that we are saved by grace and just like how brother Branham said the promise was given to the children of Israel but they had to fight for every inch of ground if you want to enjoy the benefit of the fight for Ministry you will have to fight for it praise the Lord how how will you fight for it you got to keep yourself in the word right you got to keep yourself in prayer that you will not just be carried away when somebody come and see some kind of offensive thing but you know that whatever the person is saying is in the word praise the Lord if you want to enjoy your sanctification you will have to fight for it you will have to fight against all the spirits that are trying to rob you of incentive for life you have to show those things that's the reason why Paul is dealing with these things here he says uh you know uh uh filthiness foolish talking uh uh non-jestine and and uh which are not convenient you know he says he said get rid of those things because it's going to rob you praise the Lord and then and as he comes slowly into into family life where he's dealing with the man loves your wife the woman you know respect your husband and all of that and then he gets into children and parents then he says Now put on the armor of God because if you want to enjoy those things you have to fight for it praise the Lord you want to enjoy the uh your family life you will have to fight for it you want to enjoy your your relationship with your parents you will have to fight for it you have to pray you have to uh you know uh get away from comparing yourself with other families and you know other people can do these things for their children forget about their they are not your parents they are not your parents why compare yourself with uh uh people that are not sending you to school or paying uh uh uh buying food for you praise the Lord family life you will have to fight for it the relay your relationship between your husband and wife you will have to fight for it you have to constantly pray and constantly stay in the word that's what we must put on the whole armor of God praise the Lord let's look at some few uh uh scripture here in that light praise the Lord let's look at some few scripture here in that light that there's there are other ways that Paul kind of for approach this I told her how that uh oh sorry I'm I'm kind of a key in the wrong word here okay Let's uh let's uh take Romans chapter 13. Romans chapter 13. now you will see the other left for a few minutes here mm-hmm in Romans chapter 13 . okay let's look at verse 11 trying to find a good place for us to to back up here yeah because Paul is he's dealing with in the same light of what we are talking about he says and that knowing the time that now it is High time to awake out of sleep for now that's Romans chapter 13 is am I right am I there or am I reading something different and they are knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer then when we believe praise the Lord that word nearer means that let me say it in our language the message is now becoming clearer amen the message is now becoming clearer because we are now Understanding God's purpose for our life amen you have to realize that brother Brandon make us to know in what is the attraction on the mountain he make us to know that the message will will take another turn leaving the attraction of the messenger amen told the message itself now we know that God sent us a prophet we believe that the prophet came for a purpose those fields were opened because our names were laying under those heels are we together amen he says that that's what Malachi 4 will do he will literally turn our hearts back to the faith of the father and what would do it those Divine mystery truth so when Paul says here that our Salvation nearer is now nearer than when we first believe because when we first believed we were measuring on the prophet on the baptism we were measuring on all the church forces and all the doctrine that is there but now we realize now we are the one that is now in the arena praise the Lord we are not we are not on the show just cheering now for whoever is uh you know our best preacher you know when in uh and uh you know the best environment but we realize now we are the one now in the ring we have to deal with with the reality of life we have growing up we have families we have responsibility we have an age that is rapidly changing before our eyes our salvation is nearer than we first believe praise the Lord so he says the night is fasting the day is our hand let us therefore cast all the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light praise the Lord in in Ephesians he says put on the whole armor of God now yeah in Romans he's telling if you read Romans chapter 13 you will realize that the very same thing where he's telling the church their inhibition is the same thing he's telling the the the Believers yet in in uh in uh Rome praise the Lord I'm I'm caught up in in a taught here do I have time in a few minutes laughs let me share something with you quickly uh if uh if I'm right if I'm if I'm right no I thought I had it in my notes for uh part of my notes on on Sunday that we did with there's a there's a portion of it that I never came to I'm I'm keeping it for for a little time but let me read something to you here so you so we'll be able to to grab a picture a mentor picture brother Brandon I've I've I've searched for this quote for a long time and uh the Lord kind of uh blessed me to bless us to see it the prophet said yes is uh Revelation Revelation series called the the it's not there so the technicians will now put it off but uh oh let me let me do something here let me do something you wanna it's fast we are in a wavelength so I've already sent it to them just to share with you tonight so in no time they can put it up for us and and we can we can all enjoy it together something will grab something I want to I want to make emphasis on here so so let's let's just read that it's it's out of the the message uh the revelation of Jesus Christ now brother Branham says say this he said uh let's give them few minutes okay he says the letters to the seven Church Ages were written prophetic calling to the Future ages Paul wrote of the life and the glory of the seven churches present in his day do you know that Paul has seven churches in his letters that he wrote in all the letters that Paul wrote they are 13 represent the number of a woman one is to Philemon that was a direct letter it was not to a group it was just to filament uh you know kind of for talking to him but when you when you count from The Book of Romans to the book of Hebrew and take the letter of Philemon out there are 13 letters in in all but if you count the churches that Paul wrote to the Church of Rome the Church of Corinth the Church of thessalonica the Church of episodes The Church of uh uh Philippa and the Church of collusion seven churches a kind of a blessing yeah brother Branham said Paul wrote of the life and the glory of the seven churches present in his day John wrote of the life and the glory of the seven churches in the future praise the Lord now I've used this as a bid now to grab you praise the Lord I wanted to use this as a bit to grab you then I can be able to drill what I want to drill down in you so you see here the other that uh uh if you wash the if you wash the letters of Paul if you wash the way he spoke to the churches you will see that in every church he deal with the same thing it's almost just like the seven churches in the Book of Revelation so the chapter 13 year he's talking to the the church in Rome just like the same way he's speaking to the church in Ephesus in a sixth chapter now he says put on the whole armor of God that you will be able to fight now he says here to the Roman Church as our Salvation is nearer than we first believe we're seeing the things that is happening he says yeah the night is fast pen there is no time for foolishness that there is a hand let us therefore cast all the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of life so the the the the the the the armor of God that Paul identified in inefficient where he says you know he called every member he says when you put all of those armor together the armor of light why because we walk in the light as he is in the light now so you will now be able to see your way in this age you will now be able to overcome the things that you are dealing with until you put on the whole armor of God you got to put on the armor of life because the dead is evil the day is dark praise the Lord even though science is making lights that are more brighter than ever before but it means that the reason why the lights are getting more brighter because the day is dark your dead is evil so now God comes and the armor that he dress us in is the armor of light when you take on the whole armor of God not taking one and leaving the other praise the Lord amen I heard somebody say she says you can know those that are not wearing their helmet but they banish around their head by the different wounds that they are carrying in the alliance in their family they said they said that's a there's a new a recent statistics of family I was listening to during a week I didn't get everything together so that's why I'm not sharing it with you tonight but it's very very concerning it's very very concerning and and their statistics is pulled together right here in the U.S praise the Lord and with and with uh and with that I will share it I will share it with you let me not stop speaking over my head because I'm not I'm not I've not put everything together yet you see so you we we we have to realize and is is is dwelling on family life is showing how uh the family structure has been destroyed his family structure has been ravaged you know he's is showing I mean is is very very big on why especially fathers and men are becoming weaker I will bring I'll bring I'll bring this artist to you and uh so you see it but it's because of the day that we are living in because of the day because of the age that we are in praise the Lord now so Paul called this to the to the church in Rome the the the armor of light let's let's take another another description here quarantine chapter 6. second Corinthians chapter six I'm left with a few minutes I'll close just now second Corinthians chapter six amen now so you can never you can never be able to face the evil of this day you can never be able to overcome the spirit of the age if you don't have the armor of God on because you won't be able to see it's at that age that's right so you see God dressed his people in light to protect us when we walk in the light as he is in the light we have access to the blood the blood cleanses us amen there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ now Paul yeah now in in the second Corinthians chapter 6 verse e 11. am I right no no not verse 11. okay there's there's uh verse 7. verse 6 by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love on frame by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left now in in inefficient there is the breastplate of righteousness is different from the armor of righteousness he's talking about the complete armor praise the Lord amen as it is an armor of light is an armor of righteousness so you see it he became sin for us and dress us in his righteousness that's the reason why when you read the uh uh uh take on the whole I'm out of God brother Branham said he says he says he says what are these faithful Ministries he says it's God's dress where to be able to equip the church to dress the church up for the day that we are living in you see that's the reason why we're around the subject of uh uh uh exceeding righteousness you know because because of of the age the time that we are living in praise the Lord and and that that is that is the spirit that people are dealing with because they are they are they are they are they are Church Traditions they are things that the the grace of God the message of the hour want to Deliver Us from praise the Lord you go into the church world you go into the religious word you'll find this saying very very common just to bring every one of us at the same level we are all sinners saved by grace we don't fight against it we believe it amen praise the lord we are all sinner saved by grace Ephesians just tell us here by Grace how we save it is not our work amen but when Grace save us Grace introduced us to a family and most of the time when people use that is an excuse of not getting away from their sinful habit don't judge me we are all sinners saved by grace no we're not we're not holding to our own righteousness in appreciating the grace of God we are living right in appreciating the grace of God we are getting away from the things that the word of God condemned the same way we are saved by grace that's the same way God has dressed Us in his righteousness so we have an armor of righteousness so we can make excuses he has given us an armor of righteousness it's not our own righteousness it's a filthy wreck but his righteousness is our protection so we must believe we must constantly believe in the righteous one that no matter whatever we are dealing with God is more than able to deliver us God is faithful at his word that armor of righteousness will make us to constantly believe in him praise the Lord it's the armor of light it's the armor of righteousness are we together because as we as we go you see that's that is the thing that is that is stumbling the people in the age that we are living in people are dealing with things in their life and they have created all sorts of religious way to overcome it they try to fast it out it's not going they try to pray out it's not going praise the Lord and now with those things in their life believing that God says I would be I'm your deliverer and and and those things are there what is happening to them is that the devil is using that very thing to make them to know now you see you're not a son of God you're not a daughter of God because your life has never changed why he's constantly making us to look at our our our sinful nature our our flesh realizing that by the flesh no no man will be justified and we are not appreciating the things that that the understanding that Grace is bringing to us that's where most of these people are stumbling uh uh uh uh and says well not nothing is happening most of the time when people say nothing is happening it's not among you is in themselves because a person that is seeing the grace of God that is helping them can I say nothing is happening praise the Lord now what what were the what were the the the the Apostle Paul tells us Paul will make us to realize that God think about it think about it what what a paradise it is that God we meet Paul on the road of Damascus smacked him with the light praise the Lord send ananias to pray for him Paul will get his side back but he will not get a complete healing in his eyes and Paul will testify to us that if God did not keep him with that eyes bothering him he will exalt himself Beyond himself because God blessed him so much as a messenger of Grace as the messenger of the New Testament that even Peter testified that things that were revealed to Paul Peter called a scripture that's Peter testimony he called Paul writing scripture so Paul was recognized as a prophet but here is this Prophet here bottling and brother Branham said that is the thing that will stumble Alexander the couple Smith and all of these men are demise and all of these men that will leave for why because they are seeing Paul doing this and yet he's complaining about an eye problem praise the Lord and God will do their to to all of his children he will do that to all of his children better brand him in a message on the wings of a snow white dog he says uh you know standing in a prayer line for for how many hours praying for the sake and yet I had this stomach problems praise the Lord so if we if we don't learn to appreciate God's grace beyond our weaknesses if we don't learn to emphasize on the thing that the grace of God is helping us above beyond the places where we are feeling praise the Lord you see it in every age God says to him that overcome it is now when you overcome before God knew that there will be Overcomers he knew that every age we haven't overcome even before you got here before you start facing the challenge of your age God knew that there will be Overcomers in this age that's why he says to him that overcometh not to him that will overcome but to him that overcoming because he have already seen that there will be an overcomer in this age like it was in every age and how are we going to overcome by the blood of the Lamb which is the bleeding word and the words of Our Testimony testifying on what God has done praise the Lord now testify in ourself praise the Lord you see so that's why we should put on the whole armor of God because those are the things that we are going to deal with those are the things that we are going to deal with as we talk about uh uh uh I mean even in the life of our children in the life of our spouses you know in the life of one another as we have the grace to be able to identify things that we need to work on we must also find the grace to be able to identify areas where God is helping your children areas where God is helping your husband area where God is helping your wife be able to find it and identify it says I I see the Lord is helping you yeah you know the Lord is giving us Grace here because with our fallen nature is so easy constantly we will do it on the failure and constantly dwelling on the failure is not appreciation to the grace of God praise the Lord that's why we must put on the whole armor of God we must broker ourselves with the truth to be able to identify things that we need to work on and also be able to identify things where God grace is happiness if nobody can tell you tell yourself Lord thank you you are helping me and really know I need I I I I I see I see your grace in this era of my life praise the Lord just like how Israel had to fight for every inch of ground you have to fight for every inch of ground if you want a wonderful service you got to create the atmosphere don't come put your hands in your pocket just be sitting down like a statue be looking and be wandering out thinking about things no put your mind on Christ be praying Lord help the song leader Lord give us a wonderful service today clap your hands when it's time to sink you have to fight we have to create an atmosphere praise the Lord let's enjoy the presence of the Lord amen when you enjoy the word is sounding good to you tell somebody that was good I enjoy it praise the Lord maybe I went over the person's head but we have to fight for it to be able to enjoy it we must fight for it fight for every inch of ground take on the whole armor of God it's the armor of light they say ammo of righteousness see it's just it's just almost like uh uh uh Saul knowing when David came out there with the courage that he will he will he would get Goliath saw admire the courage he knew that the boy was never had no military training but he said at least since he had the courage let me address him in my armor he did not know that David already had an armor on amen David David was wearing an armor of praise he addressed himself in in uh you know and and in in in the armor of what God has done the same God that delivered the Bear in my hand the same God that gave me the lion the God God is going to give me these Philistines amen praise the Lord and you can tell the devil that I mean you can be able to pick up things in your life and say the god that delivered me from this thing the god that delivered me from this thing you you can identify it the same God will be able to deliver me from this I don't know how I don't care how kind of how much you try to discourage you how much you know it keeps sticking in your face to weaken your face but you have to remind yourself that's the reason why you have to identify things I mean not just things you are you are practicing religiously but things that you know that God by his grace has rise you above praise the Lord I mean that's the hour we are living in looks like the Rapture keep lingering because there are few that must make it there must be there must be a small group praise the Lord and those ones are going to be Overcomers amen it's going to be Overcomers just like we are looking at this subject if you look in the life of tema the thing that term are dead there is no righteousness in it the thing that she did there you there is nothing right about it right but what did Judah call be more righteous was the thought it was the thought the desire that she had in her heart to be identified with the blessing not the art we keep looking at the Arts that our body is producing the Arts our thoughts is producing the things that we are doing what did David appreciate about uh Abigail it was not the food it was the thought behind it they taught to save him from sharing blood because David has already made up his mind is going to be a bloody money but to realize that she came at the time of Mercy to hold his hands from sharing blood it was not a fault it's not the Arts it's the talk it's the desire it's your motives and your objectives that's why you should go back tall if it is wrong as God Lord help me deliver me this action of mine was not right it's dealing with those inner things praise the Lord I mean God is good praise the Lord a lot of school let's stand on our feet tonight take on the whole armor of God you got to dress yourself in the righteousness of God you got to dress yourself in truth praise the Lord take the word take the word identify yourself with the word young people find the time slip slip into your room and pray or just find a little place where you can just meditate you just keep your mind on the Lord foreign your struggles to God because God do deliver God can deliver let's identify those places in our lives where where we need God's help and give it to the Lord don't major on it because you cannot measure on the mind on those things are minor things the major thing is what the grace of God is doing the place he's bringing you you see it it blessed my heart when I was studying the word in and just to look there and see that uh uh this whole armored of God is the armor of light [Music] that's the reason why when you take on the the the hair men of salvation you take out the breastplate of I mean uh uh righteousness and the sword of faith and all of that you know it just it just it just as as you do it in the world I mean it just opened if the world keeps opening it just keeps unfolding [Music] let us not just get uh uh uh uh satisfied with just being in church on on Wednesday night but let's be satisfied with enjoying the Lord enjoying his presence praise the Lord [Music] enjoying his presence [Music] let's enjoy the world when the word is preached let's enjoy it put yourself in it and enjoy it take something from the word said this thing bless my heart I really I would just I will keep thinking about it [Music] don't get attracted uh distracted by
