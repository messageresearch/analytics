[53:41] the birthday wishes
[53:43] and
[53:45] but this weekend uh is is a bit
[53:48] very
[53:49] very significant to me
[53:52] and uh
[54:00] especially today
[54:06] 1991
[54:10] that was that was the day i got saved
[54:13] just two days after my birthday
[54:17] so uh the sunday is very
[54:20] very very uh significant to me now
[54:24] this would be 30 years
[54:26] when i got saved
[54:29] and 27 years in the ministry
[54:33] so having three more years for you to
[54:35] bear with me
[54:38] because i'm not mentor yet
[54:42] so you get three more years to bear with
[54:44] all my foolishness
[54:47] praise the lord
[54:49] when i get 30 years
[54:51] then you can hold me accountable
[54:54] if i do those things
[54:56] praise the lord
[54:58] amen
[55:00] because uh
[55:02] [Music]
[55:04] uh scripturally
[55:07] this is scripturally and prophetically
[55:09] also
[55:18] i'll share some few things with you
[55:20] before we
[55:21] before we get into the word here
[55:24] numbers chapter 4 verse 1
[55:27] uh to 3
[55:29] sorry my voices is i think you notice
[55:32] i've been struggling with my voice now
[55:34] since uh
[55:36] last week sunday
[55:38] i kind of pressed on my voice too hard
[55:40] and and started drinking cold things
[55:43] so it's kind of for crack
[55:45] uh
[55:47] i i try to put a man in my mouth too to
[55:51] help me break the crack so
[55:53] you just got to bear with me
[55:55] amen
[55:57] if you can understand me just follow my
[55:59] signs okay
[56:01] am i preaching sign language just follow
[56:03] my signs
[56:06] or ask the person next to you what is he
[56:08] saying
[56:09] numbers chapter four the bible says and
[56:12] the law speaks unto moses and aaron
[56:14] saying
[56:15] take the psalm
[56:18] of the sons
[56:20] of koheth
[56:21] from among the sons of levi
[56:24] after their family
[56:26] by the house of their father
[56:30] from 30 years old of war
[56:34] even until 50 years old
[56:37] all that enter into the host
[56:41] to do the work
[56:43] in the tabernacle
[56:45] of israel now the the thing about the
[56:47] book of numbers is that
[56:50] in the book of numbers that's where the
[56:52] tribes were numbered that's why they
[56:53] called it the book of numbers because it
[56:55] did with numbers
[56:57] and you will see the numbers of the
[56:58] tribe you will see the numbers of of
[57:00] different things so there are different
[57:02] numbers there and if you study the book
[57:04] of numbers you will realize
[57:07] from the age of 20 years old
[57:10] a man was mentored to go to war
[57:15] but at the age of 30 years old
[57:18] them of the tribe of levites were now
[57:22] mentored to self in the house of the
[57:25] lord
[57:29] are we together
[57:31] second samuel chapter two
[57:34] reading from verse one
[57:37] then came all the trap of ezra to david
[57:40] unto hebron and speak saying behold
[57:43] we are the bones in that flesh
[57:46] also
[57:48] in time past when saul was king over us
[57:51] thou
[57:52] thou
[57:54] he that leadeth out and and brought it
[57:57] in israel and the lord said to thee
[58:01] thou shall feed my people israel
[58:04] and thou shalt be a captain over israel
[58:08] so
[58:09] all the elders of israel came to the
[58:12] king
[58:13] to abram
[58:15] and king david
[58:17] made a league with them in hebron before
[58:20] the lord
[58:22] and they anointed david or they anointed
[58:26] david king over israel
[58:28] david was 30 years old
[58:31] when he became to reign
[58:35] and he reigned
[58:36] 40 years
[58:38] so david also was annoyed 30 years if
[58:42] you look in the life of david he had
[58:44] three different anointing
[58:46] we know that samuel anointed david
[58:50] praise the lord
[58:52] samuel announced david but david never
[58:54] came to the throne but yet he was
[58:57] anointed king
[58:59] are we together
[59:04] am i right
[59:06] amen
[59:07] that first samuel chapter
[59:09] 16
[59:10] verse 13 that's where the uh uh sami or
[59:13] the prophet
[59:14] anointed david ii samuel chapter 2 verse
[59:17] 4 david
[59:19] is anointed king in judah by the men of
[59:22] judah
[59:24] and then year david is anointed and now
[59:27] placed on the throne
[59:31] praise the lord so he got three
[59:33] anointings in his life
[59:36] praise the lord
[59:39] but
[59:40] this anointing in second samuel chapter
[59:42] five
[59:43] it goes with it goes with a prophetic
[59:46] other because now
[59:48] yeah so you see he was anointed to be
[59:51] king but yet he had to be trained
[59:55] so everything that david was going
[59:58] through like war running away from saul
[1:00:01] and all of that god was using that to
[1:00:04] train him
[1:00:05] to prepare him for the throne
[1:00:09] amen that is the same thing that paul
[1:00:11] taught in the book of galatians that's
[1:00:13] the reason why
[1:00:15] the sons were given tutor even though
[1:00:18] they were hears of their father they
[1:00:20] have a right to the inheritance but they
[1:00:23] need a tutor to teach them
[1:00:26] so when they come
[1:00:28] to power they will they will rightly be
[1:00:30] able to use it because power power with
[1:00:32] our character we know that is demonic
[1:00:35] it's a tonic
[1:00:37] praise the lord
[1:00:38] so you see
[1:00:40] yeah you know a man can have a calling
[1:00:42] in his life and and i mean he can just
[1:00:45] be on fire for god i mean it is i mean
[1:00:48] that is not just all to it right
[1:00:51] that is not just all to it you can feed
[1:00:53] the chord of god in your life you know
[1:00:55] you have a gift but you are not place
[1:01:00] you are not placed
[1:01:02] so either you be you'll be rooming
[1:01:04] around
[1:01:05] and you'll be using a genuine gift to
[1:01:07] cause problems
[1:01:10] because you are not blessed you have not
[1:01:12] come to maturity yet
[1:01:15] that's why i said bear with me three
[1:01:17] years
[1:01:19] just be patient
[1:01:21] amen just be patient if i don't if i
[1:01:25] don't mention then kick me out find
[1:01:26] somebody else
[1:01:27] [Laughter]
[1:01:32] oh praise the lord i know you're
[1:01:34] thinking in your mind where is this guy
[1:01:36] coming from this morning
[1:01:40] what is he up to i'm on the birthday
[1:01:42] spiel amen
[1:01:45] glory be to god
[1:01:48] amen so
[1:01:49] you see brother branham got his
[1:01:51] commission
[1:01:52] 1933.
[1:01:54] the angel said your message will forerun
[1:01:56] the second coming of the lord
[1:01:59] it never came until 1963
[1:02:02] 30 years
[1:02:06] the lord
[1:02:07] john the baptist never came to his
[1:02:09] ministry until 30 years old
[1:02:12] from nine years he went into the
[1:02:13] wilderness
[1:02:15] he never came out the people never saw
[1:02:17] him until 30 years and he and jesus came
[1:02:21] almost the same time six months apart
[1:02:24] because his ministry was only for six
[1:02:26] months
[1:02:27] and jesus came into his ministry at 30
[1:02:30] years
[1:02:31] for three years ministry
[1:02:35] so you can have training out of your
[1:02:38] life just for a one day ministry
[1:02:41] god could train you all of your life
[1:02:44] maybe you are the stubborn type just
[1:02:46] like me
[1:02:48] just for a one-day ministry
[1:02:52] so he can use you just for one purpose
[1:02:57] and he pleasing
[1:02:58] the rest you're doing it for yourself
[1:03:04] praise the lord
[1:03:06] you know so
[1:03:07] this this is uh
[1:03:09] kind of
[1:03:10] very very significant to me
[1:03:13] thank the lord i had a lot of time to do
[1:03:16] some reflections and take inventory and
[1:03:18] just think about some things
[1:03:20] you know and just ask the lord for for
[1:03:23] more grace
[1:03:24] so i appreciate that some brother area i
[1:03:27] was thinking about thinking something
[1:03:28] yes but it was an appropriate son i need
[1:03:30] you lord
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:33] if there's ever a time that i need the
[1:03:34] lord is right now
[1:03:37] it's right now
[1:03:41] praise the lord
[1:03:43] you know because i mean many many good
[1:03:45] preachers
[1:03:46] you know never never reach to maturity
[1:03:49] you know
[1:03:50] they just they just uh
[1:03:52] the the i mean they get so prideful on
[1:03:56] the
[1:03:57] on uh you know on the uh the primary
[1:04:00] stage of the ministry
[1:04:02] you know they think they know it all
[1:04:05] and uh uh and and that's one of the
[1:04:07] things that is that is hard in order uh
[1:04:10] to to teach people
[1:04:13] you know
[1:04:14] it's very hard
[1:04:15] you know it's very hard
[1:04:17] but uh
[1:04:19] we pray that the lord will be able to
[1:04:21] help each and every one of us so we say
[1:04:23] thank you thank you for all your prayers
[1:04:25] and uh thank you for all your support
[1:04:28] like i've always said it take a good
[1:04:29] church to make a good pastor amen
[1:04:32] praise the lord
[1:04:33] he can have all of the anointing if you
[1:04:35] don't have the people to receive him he
[1:04:37] will never be a blessing
[1:04:38] so
[1:04:40] we thank you for
[1:04:41] all of your support and
[1:04:44] and everything
[1:04:47] you know
[1:04:56] so yeah i have these things right here
[1:04:58] okay yet i have another thing here in my
[1:05:00] note
[1:05:01] that i was also looking at
[1:05:05] in uh
[1:05:06] elisha had to grow 10 years
[1:05:09] you know to fake the mentor of elijah
[1:05:14] you know he said where is the god of
[1:05:17] elijah
[1:05:18] he used it you know and split the jordan
[1:05:21] but yet for him to get to that place he
[1:05:24] had to
[1:05:25] self and learn under the feet of elijah
[1:05:28] for 10 years
[1:05:31] joshua had to do the same
[1:05:33] you know he had to learn at the feet of
[1:05:35] moses
[1:05:38] not even knowing that he was going to
[1:05:40] come into the office of a prophet
[1:05:43] to lead the people
[1:05:46] so we have to we have to look we have to
[1:05:48] watch those things
[1:05:50] you know we have to watch this thing it
[1:05:52] just i mean serving god you have to
[1:05:55] understand it it's it's it's not it's
[1:05:58] not an it's not an individual thing you
[1:06:00] hear this thing salvation is an
[1:06:02] individual thing it's only individual in
[1:06:05] the way that god deals with you
[1:06:08] in the way he deals with you which means
[1:06:11] he do not pass through somebody else to
[1:06:13] deal with you he want to deal with you
[1:06:15] personally that is the individual basis
[1:06:19] it's not you on an island it's not you
[1:06:22] trying to do your own thing and you hear
[1:06:24] people i'm just saving my god
[1:06:26] if your god is not my god i don't want
[1:06:28] the other god you're saving
[1:06:33] the concept of the church is a family
[1:06:38] the concept of the church
[1:06:40] when god made man in the beginning the
[1:06:43] very concept was to have a family
[1:06:47] he expressed that in the accident
[1:06:50] he told moses i would have made the
[1:06:51] people a family of priests so god's mind
[1:06:55] for his church
[1:06:57] is to deal with them as a family
[1:07:04] praise the lord
[1:07:07] so in a family we don't look for
[1:07:09] individual success
[1:07:12] praise the lord you are not successful
[1:07:15] if the whole family is doing bad and
[1:07:17] only you doing good
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:28] so uh
[1:07:29] uh
[1:07:32] we need uh
[1:07:34] more of uh
[1:07:35] we need more grace
[1:07:37] we need more grace we need the lord
[1:07:40] to teach us each and every day
[1:07:44] so we can be able to walk close to him
[1:07:47] praise the lord
[1:07:49] amen
[1:07:51] yeah if you
[1:07:52] read the books read the book of the
[1:07:54] kings
[1:07:55] or chronicles
[1:07:57] you'll realize that most of the kings
[1:08:00] most of the kings biblical
[1:08:02] principle if you just watch between the
[1:08:04] line most of the kings came to the
[1:08:06] throne
[1:08:07] tete and plus yes
[1:08:12] just watch just watch it i know there
[1:08:14] are some like you know uh josiah and the
[1:08:16] rest of them that came younger you know
[1:08:19] samuel was anointed you know uh called
[1:08:23] he was called actually from a from a
[1:08:25] youthful age you know there are those
[1:08:27] conditions there
[1:08:29] but but scripture also have you know a
[1:08:32] general rule
[1:08:34] praise the lord
[1:08:36] amen some some people listening early
[1:08:40] then god starts to deal with them some
[1:08:42] people are stubborn and you know it's
[1:08:45] just it just takes a while and we have
[1:08:47] some of the stubborn type they have
[1:08:49] taken us a while
[1:08:54] praise the lord
[1:08:56] so
[1:09:05] i have some few things on my mind
[1:09:07] i was going to share with you
[1:09:10] and i've even forgot brother jordan
[1:09:12] uh i forgot that you were supposed to
[1:09:14] come out in
[1:09:15] and
[1:09:16] announce uh
[1:09:18] uh the
[1:09:20] come come in come and take care of that
[1:09:22] come and take care of that
[1:09:26] i told you if you don't remind me that
[1:09:28] just how it will be
[1:09:35] nobody's saying i'll just be real brief
[1:09:38] most of you have already probably seen
[1:09:40] this flyer because i noticed most of
[1:09:42] them are already missing but brother
[1:09:44] wanted asked me to put together a little
[1:09:45] event for
[1:09:46] mostly young people and families but if
[1:09:49] you're feeling young at heart you're

[1:25:05] read the scripture right now second
[1:25:07] chronicles chapter nine
[1:25:11] ii chronicles chapter 9
[1:25:18] ii chronicles chapter 9.
[1:25:29] let's read
[1:25:30] the word of the lord
[1:25:32] and when the queen of sheba heard of the
[1:25:35] firm of solomon
[1:25:36] she came to prove solomon
[1:25:39] with hard questions
[1:25:41] hard questions
[1:25:43] praise the lord she did not believe
[1:25:46] everything
[1:25:47] she came to prove solomon with hard
[1:25:50] questions and that's what i want you
[1:25:52] young people to do prove this message
[1:25:54] with her question
[1:25:56] praise the lord
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:59] don't sit down and just look and just
[1:26:01] third
[1:26:03] because
[1:26:04] we are not forcing anything down your
[1:26:06] throat
[1:26:09] we are bringing you to the river
[1:26:11] but we can force you to drink
[1:26:13] we're just telling you that this is the
[1:26:15] water of life
[1:26:17] drink from it and you'll be freed of all
[1:26:19] your problems
[1:26:25] she came to prove solomon with hard
[1:26:27] questions at jerusalem
[1:26:29] wave a very great company in camels that
[1:26:33] bear spices and gold
[1:26:37] in abundance and precious stones and
[1:26:39] when she
[1:26:40] was come to solomon she communed with
[1:26:43] him
[1:26:44] of all
[1:26:46] that was in her heart
[1:26:48] everything that she pondered on
[1:26:52] she was not
[1:26:54] holding back and just observing if she
[1:26:57] sees something she asked what is this
[1:27:00] praise the lord so she can say they say
[1:27:02] somebody said no i want to know what is
[1:27:05] this
[1:27:11] there's no sitting on the fence
[1:27:13] you are either in or you are out
[1:27:16] and solomon told her
[1:27:18] all her questions
[1:27:20] and there was nothing here
[1:27:23] from solomon
[1:27:25] which
[1:27:26] he told her not
[1:27:30] and when the queen of sheba have seen
[1:27:33] the wisdom of solomon
[1:27:37] and the house
[1:27:39] that he have built
[1:27:42] which was the temple of the lord
[1:27:45] and they meet at his table
[1:27:48] and the setting of his servants
[1:27:51] and the attendants
[1:27:53] of
[1:27:54] his ministers and their parents i mean
[1:27:56] solomon has such an order
[1:27:59] he was a man that believed in church
[1:28:00] order
[1:28:01] he had all of these things just in place
[1:28:03] they caught bearer also and they had a
[1:28:06] peril and and uh
[1:28:08] and he's a sense by which
[1:28:10] he went up into the house of the law
[1:28:13] there was no more spirit
[1:28:16] left in her
[1:28:18] when she saw how a man
[1:28:22] a human by wisdom
[1:28:24] could be able
[1:28:26] to just both things get this insane
[1:28:29] bring this and say
[1:28:31] to men that are also made out of flesh
[1:28:34] and blood
[1:28:36] praise the lord the lord bless you keep
[1:28:38] right there we'll stay reading but have
[1:28:39] your seed
[1:28:41] because it looks live already start
[1:28:42] preaching
[1:28:46] you know to see
[1:28:47] how a man's wisdom
[1:28:49] could bring decency could bring others
[1:28:54] praise the lord
[1:28:55] amen
[1:28:56] could bring others
[1:28:58] and and sins of god and people of god
[1:29:01] that's what i want you to look at
[1:29:06] that's what i want you to look at
[1:29:08] what have this word of god what have
[1:29:11] this message brought to your life
[1:29:16] praise the lord what have you brought to
[1:29:17] your home
[1:29:18] you think it's your own making
[1:29:23] praise the lord
[1:29:32] i mean there's just some things floating
[1:29:33] on my mind now but
[1:29:35] i'll be very undecent if i say those
[1:29:37] things you go to people's homes and you
[1:29:39] you you see it i mean they they get they
[1:29:42] get things of quality things of expense
[1:29:44] i mean very expensive things
[1:29:46] that they pay money for
[1:29:48] but you just see the way they put you
[1:29:51] know
[1:29:52] some things in and just having some
[1:29:55] fill the the living room with uh
[1:29:58] uh you know ten thousand waffle thing
[1:30:00] and then put a filtered picture on the
[1:30:02] wall
[1:30:06] just because of that it makes you does
[1:30:09] not even appreciate
[1:30:11] the cause of the things that that is in
[1:30:13] the room
[1:30:17] but that this word
[1:30:19] will bring decency
[1:30:22] to you
[1:30:23] young people
[1:30:26] that you can look at yourself before you
[1:30:28] step out of the house many people don't
[1:30:29] look at themselves
[1:30:32] they don't look at themselves before
[1:30:33] they step out of their house because if
[1:30:35] they were really looking at themselves
[1:30:37] they won't get out with some of the
[1:30:38] things they are wearing
[1:30:43] but how many times you dress you go no i
[1:30:45] can wear this i have to change
[1:30:52] when she saw those things
[1:30:58] the bible says there was no spirit left
[1:31:00] in her
[1:31:03] and she said to the king
[1:31:06] it was a true report
[1:31:09] which i heard
[1:31:11] in my own land
[1:31:14] of that act in all of thy wisdom
[1:31:17] praise the lord
[1:31:19] remember the scripture says she heard of
[1:31:21] the frame of solomon and she purposed in
[1:31:24] her heart to go and ask him the hard
[1:31:26] questions
[1:31:30] and she asked him all her questions
[1:31:32] there was some she did not even ask
[1:31:34] solomon in answering one question answer
[1:31:36] 10 for her
[1:31:38] because that's what the word of god does
[1:31:42] the word of god address one thing in
[1:31:44] your life is addressing 10 different
[1:31:45] things
[1:31:47] that are connected with the with those
[1:31:48] things
[1:31:53] and not only her questions but just
[1:31:57] seeing the kind of for other and decency
[1:32:03] that this man gave brought to the people
[1:32:06] of israel
[1:32:08] the bible says she had no spirit left in
[1:32:11] her
[1:32:12] in a sense i've never seen this in my
[1:32:15] life my goodness are we on earth
[1:32:20] praise the lord
[1:32:23] and that's what the holy spirit wants to
[1:32:25] do in your home
[1:32:27] when unbelievers come in your home and
[1:32:29] just see
[1:32:30] the the the all you don't have to have
[1:32:32] ten thousand dollar things in your home
[1:32:35] all you need to have is just the grace
[1:32:37] of god and the holy spirit in that home
[1:32:39] a bible that is read every morning and
[1:32:41] every night
[1:32:56] and she said to the king it was a truth
[1:32:58] report i heard in my own lane
[1:33:01] of all the knights in that wisdom
[1:33:03] howbeit
[1:33:05] i believe not their worst i never
[1:33:09] took believe this message because
[1:33:11] somebody said it to me no
[1:33:13] i wanted a personal experience
[1:33:17] it's not as second-handed
[1:33:21] handled down by somebody
[1:33:24] praise the lord
[1:33:26] and young people don't take it from your
[1:33:28] parents get your own personal experience
[1:33:33] how be it i believe in that i believe
[1:33:36] not the hours until i came
[1:33:40] and my eyes have seen it
[1:33:43] and behold
[1:33:46] the one half
[1:33:49] all that greatness
[1:33:53] or the greatness of that wisdom
[1:33:56] was not told me that's the way the
[1:33:59] inspiration of that song with your son
[1:34:01] came from they have has never yet been
[1:34:04] told
[1:34:12] praise the lord
[1:34:18] and behold the one half of that
[1:34:20] greatness
[1:34:21] the greatness of that wisdom was not
[1:34:24] told me
[1:34:26] for thou sealeth the frame that i heard
[1:34:29] you more than what
[1:34:32] i heard
[1:34:34] she said happy are thy men
[1:34:38] and happy are the sevens
[1:34:40] we stand continuously before thee
[1:34:45] and hear
[1:34:46] thy wisdom
[1:34:48] blessed be the lord thy god who
[1:34:50] delighted in thee
[1:34:53] to set thee on his throne
[1:34:56] to be king for the lord thy god because
[1:35:00] thy god love israel to establish them
[1:35:04] forever they've
[1:35:06] therefore made
[1:35:08] he the king over them
[1:35:10] to do judgment and justice in another in
[1:35:14] another sense she was saying
[1:35:16] she was saying
[1:35:18] that
[1:35:19] for god to be able to entrust you
[1:35:24] for god to be able to entrust a mortal
[1:35:29] a man born of a woman
[1:35:32] for god to be able to entrust
[1:35:38] a woman
[1:35:40] with three sacrifice you you must count
[1:35:42] yourself blessed
[1:35:46] it's not depriving you because what the
[1:35:49] world will have done to you is worse
[1:35:50] than what the grace of god is doing in
[1:35:52] your life
[1:35:57] for god
[1:36:02] to get you
[1:36:04] at a young age
[1:36:06] and start dealing with your heart
[1:36:10] if you are regretting you better repent
[1:36:13] that's what i can say to you
[1:36:15] because you think you are regretting now
[1:36:23] that god will delight in thee to set
[1:36:25] thee on his throne
[1:36:28] make you king over his people
[1:36:32] she said the half
[1:36:34] has never yet been told
[1:36:37] and i will tell you
[1:36:39] you can read all the thousand plus
[1:36:41] messages of brother branham
[1:36:42] the half that came by this ministry you
[1:36:46] will never know in this life
[1:36:51] all that you think you know of the
[1:36:52] message and even of this bible
[1:36:56] the half
[1:36:58] you will never know
[1:37:09] glory be to god
[1:37:12] here we seen a woman the scripture went
[1:37:15] on and said and she gave the kings
[1:37:17] hundreds and and
[1:37:19] 120 talents of god
[1:37:23] she brought all of these things if if
[1:37:25] they are really saying you think about
[1:37:27] it you are waiting you are just
[1:37:29] imagining you know you know you just
[1:37:30] thinking on your mind about this place
[1:37:32] they are talking about or they set in
[1:37:35] person and people you know uh you're
[1:37:37] having you're taught
[1:37:38] you know talk about wisdom where i i
[1:37:41] wonder what people are saying that i
[1:37:42] don't know whether he's guessing he's
[1:37:43] reading mine or whatever it is
[1:37:46] you know uh and and even till today
[1:37:48] people struggle when they listen to the
[1:37:50] tape and yeah brother branham honored
[1:37:51] those discernment calling people named
[1:37:53] they still struggle
[1:37:54] you know but you know uh it's just god
[1:37:57] that can give revelation amen if god
[1:38:00] don't help you there is no mortal in
[1:38:01] this life that can help you
[1:38:04] sorry that i can do it myself
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:07] so she brought out of these things she
[1:38:09] brought gates she brought spices she
[1:38:11] brought precious stones
[1:38:13] she said if this thing is truth
[1:38:16] i'm going to
[1:38:17] i'm going to support it with everything
[1:38:19] that i have
[1:38:21] i'm going to let go
[1:38:24] and let god have his way
[1:38:27] praise the
[1:38:28] lord she says happy are the men the
[1:38:33] people that stand before you every day
[1:38:37] the children they have been hearing the
[1:38:39] prophet said the prophet said from the
[1:38:40] day that they were born
[1:38:42] you must be happy
[1:38:49] praise the lord
[1:38:51] if you if your parents were training you
[1:38:53] to wash your brother branham then they
[1:38:55] were training you wrong
[1:38:58] but if they were saying they are so you
[1:39:00] will reference the word of god
[1:39:03] and the gift that god gave to this age
[1:39:05] blessed are you
[1:39:09] because those words will haunt you to
[1:39:11] your grave
[1:39:15] if you ever stray from them
[1:39:18] you ask joshua ali he will tell you a
[1:39:20] little bit of it
[1:39:30] happy have thy man happy at our seventh
[1:39:32] we stand continuously
[1:39:35] and hear that wisdom
[1:39:38] praise the lord
[1:39:40] glory be to god
[1:39:49] and we know that jesus
[1:39:53] refer to the art of this woman
[1:39:57] that's what i want to get to this
[1:39:58] morning i hope i won't keep you long
[1:40:00] i've heard the rumor time by playing
[1:40:02] guitar
[1:40:03] but uh
[1:40:11] i hope i won't keep you long
[1:40:14] because we have a community service
[1:40:16] tonight so i mean this evening
[1:40:20] this is a miracle sorry i never got back
[1:40:22] to you on that text i kept thinking
[1:40:24] about it it kept slipping my mind i'm
[1:40:26] very sorry for that
[1:40:27] and uh uh
[1:40:29] so we realized that jesus referred to
[1:40:32] the act of this woman in matthew chapter
[1:40:35] 12 let's go there a little bit
[1:40:38] what she says a woman from the south
[1:40:42] amen
[1:40:43] he said the queen of the south
[1:40:46] shall stand against this generation
[1:40:51] amen
[1:40:53] she said the queen
[1:40:55] of the south
[1:40:58] praise the lord
[1:41:01] let me bring you to terms a little bit
[1:41:04] with matthew chapter 12.
[1:41:08] matthew chapter 12
[1:41:11] is uh
[1:41:12] the breach
[1:41:14] between the ministry of jesus christ
[1:41:18] and the sahendra's counsel
[1:41:20] jesus has bear with them
[1:41:23] right from his birth they call his birth
[1:41:26] an elite illegitimate birth
[1:41:29] he had there with them and
[1:41:33] you know and all sorts of things they
[1:41:35] said about him
[1:41:37] praise the lord
[1:41:39] and uh they call him all sorts of names
[1:41:42] but matthew chapter 12
[1:41:45] was the bridge
[1:41:47] and what happened in matthew chapter 12.
[1:41:50] what happened in matthew chapter 12 it
[1:41:53] was the place where
[1:41:55] uh uh uh
[1:41:58] the the the pharisees
[1:42:01] the local the gift of jesus
[1:42:05] in verse 24
[1:42:07] and it said that everything that he's
[1:42:09] doing
[1:42:11] is because he is the prince
[1:42:15] of the devils
[1:42:17] praise the lord
[1:42:20] and what are the things that he's doing
[1:42:22] he's healing their sake
[1:42:25] praise the lord
[1:42:26] amen
[1:42:28] he met a a woman that was broken broke
[1:42:31] him because her son died that could have
[1:42:33] been her own son
[1:42:36] and he stopped the funeral procession
[1:42:38] and brought the ball back to life
[1:42:41] he did the same thing in jara's house
[1:42:44] praise the lord
[1:42:47] what was he doing
[1:42:49] healing the sack raising the dead
[1:42:53] and even feeding their multitudes
[1:42:56] that they can have 12 baskets left over
[1:42:59] to take home
[1:43:02] praise the lord
[1:43:03] but with all of that that he was doing
[1:43:06] just because
[1:43:09] he could not
[1:43:10] condescend to their religious idea or
[1:43:13] what they think
[1:43:16] religion is
[1:43:20] they are saying he is the prince of the
[1:43:23] devil
[1:43:25] praise the lord
[1:43:27] that will end
[1:43:29] jesus public ministry
[1:43:33] the next time that they will see him
[1:43:34] publicly that's when he will come on the
[1:43:36] donkey
[1:43:38] and few days he will be taken to calvary
[1:43:43] that's what matthew chapter 12 is is the
[1:43:45] bridge
[1:43:47] when they call him the prince of devils
[1:43:50] verse 25 by the pharisees
[1:43:53] heard it they said this fellow does not
[1:43:55] cast our devil
[1:43:57] but by bestiable the prince of the devil
[1:44:01] and jesus knew their thoughts and he
[1:44:04] said unto them every kingdom divided
[1:44:05] against itself
[1:44:07] shall not stand
[1:44:09] if satan
[1:44:10] said now you you can read that words and
[1:44:13] and and and whichever way the tune of
[1:44:16] your voice is but i believe that jesus
[1:44:18] was very steadfast i believe that he was
[1:44:21] very emotional
[1:44:24] that you call the work of god the devil
[1:44:27] and the word you can say that against
[1:44:29] the son of man will be forgiving you
[1:44:32] but one word said against the holy ghost
[1:44:36] will not be forgiving you in this word
[1:44:39] or in the word to come and just like i
[1:44:41] told you before jesus never said when
[1:44:43] you blast him the holy ghost fire will
[1:44:45] fall from heaven
[1:44:47] he never said it and that's the reason
[1:44:49] why people can blaspheme the holy ghost
[1:44:51] they can say things about the church
[1:44:53] they can say things about the people of
[1:44:54] god and and be living free they think
[1:44:57] that it's okay
[1:45:01] but he says it will not be forgiving you
[1:45:03] in this world
[1:45:05] or in the world to come
[1:45:07] so wait for your reward
[1:45:09] at the day of judgment
[1:45:12] praise the lord
[1:45:13] we will bear your insult for now but
[1:45:16] wait for your reward
[1:45:18] so that was the breach
[1:45:20] he said if our bible cast devils by whom
[1:45:24] your sons your children cast them out by
[1:45:27] now so jesus
[1:45:29] honor this honor this emotional
[1:45:32] expression trying to tell them
[1:45:35] that you call yourself religious leaders
[1:45:38] your ministry has filled these people
[1:45:41] you have never been able to bring
[1:45:43] revival
[1:45:45] you get a lot of moses but yet you get
[1:45:47] bad girls and sick people all in your
[1:45:49] streets
[1:45:52] and yes a man ministry that have taken
[1:45:54] god out of history
[1:45:57] yes a man administrator have called
[1:45:59] jesus on the scene the same yesterday
[1:46:02] today and forever
[1:46:07] he says and then you turn around and
[1:46:08] call this the devil
[1:46:10] praise the lord so jesus is honor he's
[1:46:14] he's on
[1:46:15] this emotion dealing with him
[1:46:18] then he comes to the same
[1:46:21] praise the lord
[1:46:24] he said unto them an evil and adopted
[1:46:26] generation seek after sign
[1:46:29] but no sign will be given to you
[1:46:32] he said there will be no sign given to
[1:46:34] you
[1:46:36] except the sign of no uh
[1:46:38] jonah praise the lord
[1:46:41] now you have to watch this now you have
[1:46:43] to watch this because we are industry we
[1:46:46] are in the scripture
[1:46:48] and even industrial generation seek
[1:46:50] after sign and there shall no sign be
[1:46:53] giving unto it by the sign
[1:46:55] of the prophet jonah
[1:46:58] as
[1:46:59] jonah was three days and three nights
[1:47:04] in the belly of the well
[1:47:06] praise the lord so jesus now is taking
[1:47:11] what happened to jonah and then which of
[1:47:14] course
[1:47:15] jesus saying that means that it was not
[1:47:18] just a fairy tale amen
[1:47:20] if jesus who compared his death
[1:47:24] barrier and resurrection to what
[1:47:26] happened to jonah then which means it
[1:47:28] really happened
[1:47:32] so he talks he takes jonah
[1:47:36] as a sign of the resurrection
[1:47:39] praise the lord as jonah spent three
[1:47:42] days in a wheelbarrow so the son of man
[1:47:45] we also spent three days in the heart of
[1:47:47] the earth
[1:47:48] so jesus said that that would be your
[1:47:51] last sign
[1:47:53] will be the resurrection
[1:47:57] your last sign will be an empty tome
[1:48:02] that's the last thing
[1:48:04] israel you will see an empty tomb
[1:48:08] praise the lord
[1:48:10] they honor their same burden
[1:48:12] he says the queen of the south
[1:48:16] now he's dealing with his ministry
[1:48:21] but yet he's bringing in
[1:48:23] another woman
[1:48:25] he's bringing in a gentile ministry he's
[1:48:29] bringing in a gentile church
[1:48:34] praise the lord
[1:48:37] so in another sense what jesus is saying
[1:48:40] there is that you have rejected your
[1:48:43] visitation
[1:48:45] and this visitation that you have
[1:48:47] rejected the gentiles will rejoice in it
[1:48:50] because just like how the queen of the
[1:48:53] south
[1:48:54] traveled from fire
[1:48:57] to come and see the wisdom of solomon
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:02] praise the lord
[1:49:04] and i believe that's that's that's where
[1:49:06] we came from
[1:49:08] we came from fire
[1:49:09] we came from idolatry we came from
[1:49:12] witchcraft we came from every darkness
[1:49:16] of adolescence
[1:49:19] praise the lord
[1:49:20] to come be worshipping god in spirit and
[1:49:22] truth
[1:49:23] he brought us from fire amen
[1:49:26] if you can say amen to the word of god
[1:49:28] god brought your spirit from fire
[1:49:36] the queen of the south shall rise in
[1:49:39] judgment
[1:49:40] with this generation
[1:49:42] and she
[1:49:43] and shall condemn it for she came from
[1:49:46] the uttermost part
[1:49:49] of the earth
[1:49:51] to hear
[1:49:52] the wisdom of solomon now this is
[1:49:55] another place
[1:49:57] that is also tricky
[1:50:00] she never came because of solomon
[1:50:03] she came because of the gift
[1:50:08] she came because of
[1:50:10] the wisdom of solomon it was not the man
[1:50:13] that attracted her it was the gift that
[1:50:16] was manifested
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:19] praise the lord
[1:50:21] we're not following the man we are
[1:50:23] following fulfilled scripture
[1:50:25] malachi 4 says behold i send you elijah
[1:50:28] the prophet
[1:50:30] saying luke 17 30 says in the day that
[1:50:32] the son of man will be revealed
[1:50:34] revelation 10 7 says
[1:50:37] in the voice
[1:50:39] of the seven angel we are following
[1:50:41] fulfilled scripture
[1:50:45] we're not following the man
[1:50:52] she came from the south
[1:50:55] to hear the wisdom of solomon
[1:50:58] and he says behold i said unto you
[1:51:01] and greater than solomon
[1:51:04] is here amen
[1:51:06] a greater than solomon
[1:51:08] you know when you hear a greater than
[1:51:11] solomon it's so easy for you to think is
[1:51:14] the man it's not the man
[1:51:16] what is important here is the ministry
[1:51:23] jesus in another term you are saying the
[1:51:25] same way solomon brought and not one
[1:51:28] other to the temple of god a ministry is
[1:51:31] here to bring a natural order in the
[1:51:34] spirit of man whether we worship god in
[1:51:36] spirit and in truth
[1:51:43] a greater
[1:51:45] than solomon
[1:51:46] is year
[1:51:49] a gift
[1:51:50] that will change our lives
[1:51:52] that will make us decent men
[1:51:55] and decent ladies
[1:51:58] a gift that will rob us
[1:52:01] the gift will rob us
[1:52:04] it will rob you
[1:52:07] from all your wickedness
[1:52:10] your selfishness
[1:52:13] praise the lord
[1:52:14] that's what this holy ghost would do for
[1:52:16] you it will rob you
[1:52:17] from all your habits
[1:52:22] glory be to god
[1:52:26] it will rob you so much
[1:52:28] that when he's finished dealing with you
[1:52:30] you will not know how to find a way to
[1:52:33] go back to the be a pilot
[1:52:36] he will rob you until if they put a
[1:52:39] cigarette in your hand you don't know
[1:52:40] what to do with it
[1:52:44] glory be to god
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:48] the things that you used to love he he
[1:52:51] gets in there and he takes the desire
[1:52:54] try to do it you can't do it
[1:52:57] because why you can't find fun in doing
[1:52:59] it
[1:53:01] he takes the desire that's all he takes
[1:53:05] he just take the desire he destroys the
[1:53:07] desire
[1:53:13] a greater
[1:53:14] than solomon
[1:53:17] is here
[1:53:19] praise the lord
[1:53:21] and greater than solomon
[1:53:24] is here
[1:53:26] she said of the things that i've heard
[1:53:28] and the things that i've seen
[1:53:31] i believe
[1:53:33] that the half
[1:53:34] has never yet been told
[1:53:40] all that i've seen
[1:53:42] praise the lord
[1:53:43] and bring us to that place where paul
[1:53:45] says that he that thinketh he know
[1:53:51] does not know as he ought to know
[1:53:54] because there is more to know
[1:54:00] there is more of god to know
[1:54:02] there is more of grace to know
[1:54:06] praise the lord
[1:54:10] you see because christ and dark matters
[1:54:12] it just block our mind
[1:54:14] it stopped us in a certain level of
[1:54:17] understanding and we think that is all
[1:54:19] of god
[1:54:23] but the love of god
[1:54:25] carry you beyond
[1:54:28] every situation
[1:54:31] so jesus
[1:54:34] referring back to that lady
[1:54:38] she was a gentile woman she was not a
[1:54:40] jew
[1:54:42] she was a gentile she came from the
[1:54:44] south
[1:54:45] jesus said the outermost part of the
[1:54:47] earth
[1:54:51] because she hear the wisdom
[1:54:55] of solomon
[1:54:57] she heard about a gift that can answer
[1:55:00] all your questions
[1:55:03] praise the lord
[1:55:05] just like daniel said he is the deserver
[1:55:08] of every doubt
[1:55:12] praise the lord
[1:55:20] a greater
[1:55:21] than solomon
[1:55:23] is here
[1:55:26] praise the lord
[1:55:28] hallelujah
[1:55:31] oh what a wonderful
[1:55:33] wonderful jesus we serve
[1:55:35] let's read this in revelation chapter 4.
[1:55:38] this is from the revelation series
[1:55:43] let's read this
[1:55:45] the 24 editors here
[1:55:51] in revelation chapter 4
[1:55:53] you will realize that
[1:55:56] john
[1:55:59] that john saw some things
[1:56:01] in the book of revelation
[1:56:04] and those things
[1:56:06] were even from the beginning
[1:56:09] amen
[1:56:10] but john saw it in a complete different
[1:56:13] way like we said when we talk about the
[1:56:15] cherry beans you know there were two
[1:56:16] cherry beans that was placed in the
[1:56:18] garden of eden moses on a vision that's
[1:56:20] why he saw when god says block the tree
[1:56:22] of life
[1:56:23] but
[1:56:25] ezekiel saw and he saw the same cherubim
[1:56:28] but he saw it from another place when
[1:56:30] isaiah saw the the the those angels
[1:56:34] he saw them from another place he saw
[1:56:36] them like a train they are different
[1:56:38] from the seraphims he saw the seraphim
[1:56:40] but he saw the cherubims moving so fast
[1:56:43] like a train
[1:56:47] and when john saw
[1:56:49] the same
[1:56:51] cherubians he saw them with four faces
[1:56:55] in the book of revelation
[1:56:57] but now we're not talking about the
[1:56:59] cherubians we're talking about the glory
[1:57:02] let's read yet a little bit you will see
[1:57:04] remember
[1:57:05] it made
[1:57:06] it with the earth his colors but now
[1:57:09] watch this rainbow
[1:57:12] only horizontally
[1:57:14] just cover in the ball now this is this
[1:57:18] is showing
[1:57:20] pointing back to the coveting of noah
[1:57:25] praise the lord
[1:57:28] to the covenant of noah
[1:57:33] when god made the covenant with noah
[1:57:38] are we together
[1:57:42] and he brought the floor to an end
[1:57:45] and what did god do he shoot
[1:57:48] a rainbow in the clouds
[1:57:50] amen
[1:57:52] now so the rainbow
[1:57:55] goes
[1:57:56] from one end and you cover the class and
[1:57:58] it goes to another end
[1:58:00] praise the lord
[1:58:02] now so what is described here what
[1:58:05] brother branham is describing here is
[1:58:07] that
[1:58:08] what what noah saw or moses described in
[1:58:13] the book of genesis as the rainbow was
[1:58:16] the same light
[1:58:19] that was around the throne
[1:58:21] in an amber color
[1:58:24] now so for noah it came as a half
[1:58:30] why because god was making
[1:58:33] confidence with his people
[1:58:36] praise the lord
[1:58:38] amen
[1:58:39] he was making confidence with the earth
[1:58:42] and his people
[1:58:45] and what he was telling them is that i
[1:58:48] give you it's almost like the chinese
[1:58:50] laundry man
[1:58:52] the rainbow is like the chinese laundry
[1:58:55] man
[1:58:57] he never knew how to speak or write
[1:59:00] so he cut the paper
[1:59:02] into two halves
[1:59:04] and he gave
[1:59:06] the owner of the clothes half
[1:59:09] and he kept half to himself
[1:59:12] so god was showing in the heavens
[1:59:16] that that wish concerning redeeming the
[1:59:19] earth and redeeming his people
[1:59:21] i'm giving half
[1:59:24] and i will keep half to myself
[1:59:27] that's the reason why the mistress of
[1:59:30] god needed to be revealed in this day
[1:59:33] because it held back
[1:59:34] the secret of redemption
[1:59:40] glory be to god
[1:59:42] let's study the flood a little bit
[1:59:44] uh genesis chapter eight
[1:59:49] genesis chapter eight
[1:59:56] we know the number eight
[1:59:58] means a new day
[2:00:01] amen
[2:00:07] and brother everyone you when you say
[2:00:09] i'm taking it up a little bit that thing
[2:00:10] just struck my mind
[2:00:12] as that's on on on the piano the 8th key
[2:00:16] is an octave
[2:00:18] it means a new level
[2:00:20] i'm not a music teacher but
[2:00:22] [Laughter]
[2:00:25] because the number eight means a new day
[2:00:29] and right in genesis 8 god was about to
[2:00:32] start a new day on earth
[2:00:34] after the flood ended
[2:00:38] oh praise the lord
[2:00:43] falling in love with jesus
[2:00:47] is the best thing to have ever happened
[2:00:50] amen
[2:00:56] genesis chapter 8
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:02] and the lord god
[2:01:06] and god remember noah in every living
[2:01:09] thing
[2:01:11] and all the cattles
[2:01:14] that
[2:01:15] was with him in the ark and god
[2:01:19] made a win to pass over the earth
[2:01:23] praise the lord
[2:01:26] and the watered eyes wage
[2:01:28] and the fountain also of the deep
[2:01:33] and the windows of heaven was stopped
[2:01:35] and the rain
[2:01:37] from heaven was restrained
[2:01:39] praise the lord
[2:01:41] amen
[2:01:43] and the waters return
[2:01:46] from
[2:01:48] of
[2:01:50] the earth
[2:01:52] continuously and after
[2:01:55] the end of the 150 days
[2:01:58] the water were a bit
[2:02:00] now watch this now
[2:02:02] there is something that is hidden in
[2:02:04] here
[2:02:05] i know i did it to myself i left my
[2:02:07] notes on this in my bible at home but
[2:02:09] it's okay
[2:02:10] i will do my best
[2:02:13] the act rested
[2:02:15] on
[2:02:17] the seventh month
[2:02:19] praise the lord
[2:02:21] they are rested on the seventh month
[2:02:26] on the 17th day
[2:02:30] of
[2:02:31] the month
[2:02:37] upon the mountain
[2:02:39] of areas
[2:02:42] now
[2:02:44] brother branham spoke about it he
[2:02:46] brought out those days
[2:02:48] there but there is something that is
[2:02:50] healing in that text
[2:02:53] that
[2:02:54] you will appreciate
[2:02:56] if you just look at the dates there
[2:03:01] now you have to realize
[2:03:04] that
[2:03:06] if
[2:03:07] moses is giving an account here and says
[2:03:09] the act rested on the seventh month
[2:03:14] he's using
[2:03:18] the silver calendar because the jews
[2:03:20] have two calendars
[2:03:23] praise the lord
[2:03:26] they have the silver calendar
[2:03:30] and they also have a religious calendar
[2:03:33] now the religious calendar came to birth
[2:03:37] in exeter
[2:03:40] are we together amen
[2:03:43] now they were in the seven months of the
[2:03:47] year
[2:03:49] are we together
[2:03:50] they are they were in the seven months
[2:03:52] of the year which is the month of nissan
[2:03:56] and god told them
[2:03:58] that this month
[2:04:00] will be the beginning
[2:04:02] of months
[2:04:05] are we together
[2:04:06] so you see how the jewish people came
[2:04:09] about with the two calendars
[2:04:12] because it was in the month of nisan
[2:04:14] when god told them that this month would
[2:04:16] be the beginning of months
[2:04:20] so he gave them a new calendar that is
[2:04:23] completely different from this
[2:04:32] praise the lord
[2:04:33] amen
[2:04:35] it's completely different from this
[2:04:36] because this is an event before accident
[2:04:44] are we together
[2:04:46] i drew a chat yesterday i stuck it in my
[2:04:49] bible
[2:04:51] at home when i got home last night
[2:04:53] and uh
[2:04:56] i don't have the time to do it here but
[2:04:58] uh
[2:04:59] the half has never yet been told bro
[2:05:00] this whole problem on me this morning
[2:05:03] but let's let's just let's do it on it a
[2:05:04] little bit i'll give you the concept
[2:05:07] maybe by the grace of god i'll bring the
[2:05:08] chat in and so you can appreciate it so
[2:05:10] you will realize here so what is
[2:05:12] happening now
[2:05:14] what is happening now think about it now
[2:05:17] so the seventh month
[2:05:19] in the silver calendar
[2:05:22] is the first month
[2:05:24] in the religious calendar
[2:05:26] are we together
[2:05:30] am i confusing you
[2:05:34] they have two calendars
[2:05:37] they have a religious calendar because
[2:05:40] they have to follow you have to realize
[2:05:42] that this religious kalana has all the
[2:05:45] dates for their feasts
[2:05:48] all the feast days that that that the
[2:05:51] the the the observe the the tub and even
[2:05:55] the passover now this is excellent let's
[2:05:57] go to accident
[2:05:59] let's go to accident
[2:06:03] praise the lord
[2:06:09] exodus chapter 12.
[2:06:14] amen exodus chapter 12.
[2:06:23] exodus chapter 12 reading
[2:06:25] from uh verse one and the law speaks
[2:06:28] unto moses and unto aaron in the land of
[2:06:31] egypt saying
[2:06:33] this month shall be unto you the
[2:06:36] beginning of months
[2:06:39] this did not begin
[2:06:41] the jewish calendar this began their
[2:06:45] religious calendar why because god was
[2:06:48] about to establish an ordinance with him
[2:06:52] the reason why is the beginning of
[2:06:54] months because he's going to establish
[2:06:57] the passover
[2:07:01] are we together
[2:07:03] amen
[2:07:05] now so
[2:07:06] you have to realize that they already
[2:07:09] had a form of kalana that they were
[2:07:11] following
[2:07:13] this was not january 1st
[2:07:17] they were already in the middle of the
[2:07:19] year but god is coming down mantle says
[2:07:22] now right now we're going to start a new
[2:07:25] beginning
[2:07:27] this is going to be a new beginning
[2:07:32] praise the lord
[2:07:34] this month that i'm bringing you out of
[2:07:36] egypt is going to be the beginning of
[2:07:38] months for you
[2:07:42] but then in comparing
[2:07:45] to the silver calendar
[2:07:48] praise the lord
[2:07:51] if i if if i would have said that
[2:07:53] thought about it earlier i would have
[2:07:54] asked brother jordan to pull that out
[2:07:56] for me
[2:07:57] in comparing to the to the to the silver
[2:08:00] colander that they have
[2:08:03] the the the the month is already the
[2:08:06] year is already in the seventh month
[2:08:10] praise the lord
[2:08:13] but then in the seventh month god is now
[2:08:16] beginning a new order a new day with
[2:08:19] them and said this is the beginning of
[2:08:22] months are we together
[2:08:26] now the reason why
[2:08:29] is going to be
[2:08:30] very
[2:08:31] interesting
[2:08:33] is that
[2:08:34] if you bring this seven month
[2:08:39] in comparing
[2:08:41] to the religious calendar
[2:08:44] it's the first month of the year
[2:08:46] are we together
[2:08:48] now the scripture says
[2:08:51] here
[2:08:53] that uh
[2:08:54] uh and on the religious calendar there
[2:08:57] in uh in exeter that we have just read
[2:09:00] let's let's go down a little bit
[2:09:06] amen
[2:09:10] verse
[2:09:11] verse 6
[2:09:13] and ye shall keep it
[2:09:16] up until
[2:09:18] the 14 days of the same month
[2:09:22] praise the lord
[2:09:24] are we together
[2:09:25] so now you will realize that
[2:09:28] the 14th day
[2:09:32] is
[2:09:33] the passover
[2:09:38] are we together
[2:09:39] amen
[2:09:40] if the 14th day is the passover
[2:09:45] word the sacrifice is killed
[2:09:51] and then according to the scripture
[2:09:54] jesus resurrected after three days
[2:09:59] yeah so 3 to 14 is how much
[2:10:02] 17.
[2:10:05] so the very day that the act rest
[2:10:08] arrested
[2:10:10] was a prophecy of jesus resurrection
[2:10:19] praise the lord
[2:10:23] god forgive me if i confuse you
[2:10:27] praise the lord
[2:10:28] but see it is a new beginning
[2:10:32] god is
[2:10:34] going to have a new beginning with the
[2:10:35] earth
[2:10:37] the earth has already gone out of
[2:10:39] judgment
[2:10:40] forty days and forty night
[2:10:44] god has struck the earth
[2:10:47] because of the evil
[2:10:50] and now he's going to start a new
[2:10:54] covenant it's right in genesis chapter 8
[2:10:59] the last verse where he says
[2:11:01] summer winter
[2:11:03] will never change as long as the earth
[2:11:05] remains
[2:11:07] so in genesis chapter 8 god is
[2:11:10] establishing a new covenant with the
[2:11:12] earth
[2:11:14] are we together
[2:11:17] amen
[2:11:20] are we are we together
[2:11:22] amen so he's establishing a new covenant
[2:11:25] with the earth
[2:11:26] and right in there
[2:11:29] he's also bringing a prophecy
[2:11:36] praise lord
[2:11:37] which means the new covenant with the
[2:11:39] earth is is a sign of
[2:11:43] the day of our new birth
[2:11:51] what uh uh uh what the the dead yes peak
[2:11:55] the seven month
[2:11:58] and the seventeen day speaks of in
[2:12:01] genesis year
[2:12:02] is pointing to the resurrection of jesus
[2:12:05] christ
[2:12:09] it does not have no
[2:12:11] natural fulfillment for the gentiles
[2:12:15] it does not have a natural fulfillment
[2:12:17] that may 17 something is going to happen
[2:12:19] no it was only a place there as a
[2:12:22] prophet saying
[2:12:27] are we together
[2:12:30] because that seven months
[2:12:32] is the month of nisan which is the month
[2:12:35] of abba that is the first month of the
[2:12:37] religious calendar and on the 14th day
[2:12:41] is the passover that's when the passover
[2:12:43] is killed
[2:12:47] are we together
[2:12:48] so when a passover is killed on the 14th
[2:12:51] day
[2:12:52] and our passover was killed on the 14th
[2:12:56] day
[2:12:58] and then he resurrected three days after
[2:13:01] that goes back to the 17 of nissan
[2:13:09] praise the lord
[2:13:15] are we together
[2:13:18] but let's go ahead here
[2:13:22] amen
[2:13:26] now so you see here over here in this
[2:13:29] new
[2:13:30] new covenant that god is establishing
[2:13:33] with the earth what brother branham is
[2:13:35] saying there in revelation series is
[2:13:37] that
[2:13:38] yeah in the book of revelation chapter 4
[2:13:42] when john look at the troon he's seeing
[2:13:45] a halo light that is in a full cycle
[2:13:49] and the com the hill of light he's seen
[2:13:52] in revelation because the bible says it
[2:13:53] was all around the throne
[2:13:56] the hill of light he's seen in
[2:13:57] revelation
[2:13:58] is the exact representation of what the
[2:14:01] rainbow was
[2:14:04] but when the rainbow came up it came as
[2:14:06] half
[2:14:09] the rainbow just that's why it was
[2:14:11] called a ball or as it would be called a
[2:14:13] ring cycle
[2:14:16] it was called a ball because a ball is a
[2:14:18] half of a cycle
[2:14:20] when you strike a ball it becomes half
[2:14:21] of a cycle
[2:14:25] praise the lord
[2:14:27] so god was stretching his board
[2:14:32] oh my
[2:14:33] that's the thing that would get into the
[2:14:35] devil's eye
[2:14:37] because god healed
[2:14:39] he had the redemption
[2:14:42] secret of his children to himself
[2:14:44] the devil thought he knew that's the
[2:14:46] reason why he wanted to destroy sarah
[2:14:50] before isaac would be born
[2:14:53] the lord
[2:14:56] because as much as if abimelech would
[2:14:58] have slept with with syrup it would
[2:15:01] destroy the promise
[2:15:03] that's the reason why he wanted to
[2:15:05] destroy moses
[2:15:07] killed all the child when moses was born
[2:15:10] and why because he thought he was
[2:15:12] guessing oh yeah maybe this is the
[2:15:14] woman's seed
[2:15:16] but the half was kept to god
[2:15:21] the half was kept
[2:15:23] praise the lord
[2:15:25] the half of your life
[2:15:28] was kept to god
[2:15:32] praise the lord what god will use to
[2:15:35] bring you to your knees only he knows
[2:15:41] if you are a child of god what he will
[2:15:43] use
[2:15:44] to have you crawl back to the kingdom
[2:15:46] only god knows you can be stubborn as a
[2:15:49] rock
[2:15:50] but god has
[2:15:52] he has the main thing with him
[2:15:54] what you have you just you just have
[2:15:57] you know
[2:15:58] 20 years of story that you know
[2:16:03] they have has never yet been told
[2:16:06] what you will go through
[2:16:08] what your life will become
[2:16:10] they have
[2:16:11] has never yet been told
[2:16:16] all you young people that you think you
[2:16:17] smart
[2:16:18] and you know what you want i know what i
[2:16:20] want for my life
[2:16:22] i know what i want nobody can tell me
[2:16:24] what i want i know what i want
[2:16:28] that's when your mouth become crooked
[2:16:36] glory be to god
[2:16:41] this is a gentile woman
[2:16:44] coming from idolatry
[2:16:47] knowing nothing about jehovah god
[2:16:50] but she sat there
[2:16:52] and she heard the word of god she heard
[2:16:55] the wisdom of solomon
[2:16:59] and she also looked to see how this
[2:17:01] wisdom is affecting the people's life
[2:17:05] that's how you judge that god is in the
[2:17:08] midst of the people
[2:17:10] now we're not talking about prosperity
[2:17:12] god will bless us and god will do this
[2:17:14] for us how is that thing affecting our
[2:17:16] life how is it changing us
[2:17:22] praise the lord
[2:17:24] that's what you should look for
[2:17:27] is it affecting your life
[2:17:36] all the half
[2:17:37] has never yet been told
[2:17:41] glory be to god
[2:17:43] are we together
[2:17:46] all the half has never yet been told
[2:17:52] why because god kept it to himself
[2:17:55] daniel saw it a little bit of faith in
[2:17:57] daniel chapter 12
[2:17:59] god told him seal it up
[2:18:01] because he's kept for the time of the
[2:18:02] end
[2:18:05] daniel said i know markel will stand for
[2:18:07] his people in the in those days now
[2:18:09] because of everything that the jews were
[2:18:11] going through you were just saying that
[2:18:13] they will be wept out of the earth
[2:18:16] babylon could not wipe them out
[2:18:18] even hitler could not wipe them out
[2:18:22] because god kept a portion
[2:18:24] of the jewish secret to himself
[2:18:27] how he will restore them and he will
[2:18:29] make the desert to flourish again he
[2:18:32] kept that to himself
[2:18:36] he kept it to himself
[2:18:39] that's the reason why he kept
[2:18:41] a portion
[2:18:43] of your life secret to himself
[2:18:45] and the only way you will know until you
[2:18:48] seek it until you seek his face
[2:18:55] until you seek his face
[2:19:00] you know the story of a brother branham
[2:19:01] not born in a religious home
[2:19:04] and he had this gift from a child seeing
[2:19:07] visions he was confused
[2:19:11] until 1947 when he went
[2:19:14] he told his wife
[2:19:16] god either answered me
[2:19:19] oh that would be the end of my life
[2:19:23] praise the lord
[2:19:25] and an angel from the presence of the
[2:19:27] lord
[2:19:28] said i've come to tell you
[2:19:30] what god had back
[2:19:32] concerning your mysterious life
[2:19:35] that's what the new birth is all about
[2:19:38] that's what it's all about
[2:19:41] it's not to make you a church member
[2:19:43] is to make you sons and daughters of god
[2:19:48] praise the lord
[2:19:49] because sometimes you are confused you
[2:19:51] love god but i mean they are just things
[2:19:53] that keep bothering you you praying
[2:19:54] about it you prayed about it and they
[2:19:56] can't go away
[2:19:57] and yet those things does not take you
[2:19:59] far away from god they carry you more in
[2:20:02] the presence of god oh god help me lord
[2:20:04] jesus deliver me oh god deliver me
[2:20:10] praise the lord and sometimes you get
[2:20:12] confused
[2:20:14] watch this thing keep happening around
[2:20:16] my life
[2:20:17] why
[2:20:18] why me
[2:20:24] i'm telling you that half has never yet
[2:20:26] been told
[2:20:30] that's why paul says eyes have not seen
[2:20:33] and years have not heard
[2:20:35] because the half has never yet been told
[2:20:39] eyes have not seen in years have not
[2:20:41] heard
[2:20:42] what god have installed
[2:20:46] for these people
[2:20:48] praise the lord
[2:20:50] all the world they can see this there
[2:20:51] the whole christianity you because you
[2:20:53] suffer you you do this you do that and i
[2:20:55] mean you get all sorts of things
[2:20:57] to say about christians
[2:20:59] but the half has never
[2:21:02] yet been told
[2:21:06] glory be to god
[2:21:09] amen
[2:21:10] no saw that
[2:21:12] half of the amber light
[2:21:14] but john saw the complete light around
[2:21:17] the throne
[2:21:18] in the book of revelation
[2:21:21] he saw the complete light around the
[2:21:24] throne
[2:21:30] oh people of god
[2:21:33] amen
[2:21:34] let me just read this from the gamma's
[2:21:36] church edge and then we close here
[2:21:39] and then the word
[2:21:42] he has left behind on the printed pages
[2:21:45] is a part of him
[2:21:48] when you accept it by faith
[2:21:51] into a spirit-filled life
[2:21:54] he said that his word is life
[2:21:58] that's what jesus says in john teddy
[2:22:02] but that is exactly what he is saint
[2:22:06] john 14 6 he says i'm the way the truth
[2:22:08] and the life romans 8 9
[2:22:12] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[2:22:15] he he is none of his there it is he is
[2:22:19] spirit and he is life
[2:22:22] that is exactly what the word is
[2:22:26] that is exactly what jesus is
[2:22:30] he is the word so when
[2:22:33] a spirit-born spirit fill man
[2:22:37] in faith takes the word into his heart
[2:22:41] and place it upon his lips
[2:22:44] when you take god's word in your heart
[2:22:48] and place it upon your lip
[2:22:52] praise the lord thank you brother johnny
[2:22:54] amen
[2:22:58] hallelujah
[2:23:00] a spirit film don't try to reason it
[2:23:02] that's the problem don't try to figure
[2:23:04] it out
[2:23:06] say god said it
[2:23:08] praise the lord
[2:23:11] god said it that's the way he said it
[2:23:14] don't paraphrase it
[2:23:16] either amen
[2:23:19] glory be to god
[2:23:22] say it just like he said it
[2:23:25] because that word has the power to
[2:23:28] produce itself
[2:23:33] when a spiritual man
[2:23:36] or woman of god
[2:23:38] take the word of god into their heart
[2:23:40] and put that same word back on their
[2:23:42] lips
[2:23:46] glory be to god
[2:23:49] amen
[2:23:52] well that is the same as deity speaking
[2:23:58] that is the same as almighty god
[2:24:00] speaking
[2:24:02] glory be to god
[2:24:03] you want to speak like deity don't
[2:24:05] paraphrase god's word
[2:24:08] you want to speak like deity say what
[2:24:10] the word says
[2:24:11] don't don't think about how it would
[2:24:13] come to pass don't worry about it
[2:24:15] because deity don't worry deity is in
[2:24:17] control
[2:24:19] deity is in control
[2:24:22] when god said it his word do not go out
[2:24:24] and return back
[2:24:28] so when the son of god or the daughter
[2:24:30] of god put the word of god on
[2:24:32] don't let your mind to trouble you
[2:24:40] praise the lord
[2:24:42] amen
