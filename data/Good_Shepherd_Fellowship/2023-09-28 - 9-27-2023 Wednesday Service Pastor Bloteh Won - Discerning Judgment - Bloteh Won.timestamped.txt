[40:37] he had a uh
[40:41] us
[40:43] excuse from his work to kind of Step In
[40:46] to Lee songs last Sunday and I'm very
[40:50] grateful for that praise the Lord amen
[40:53] first king chapter 3
[40:55] first king chapter three tonight I was
[40:58] going to speak on Solomon in all of his
[41:01] glory
[41:02] but while I was driving
[41:05] coming to church I was playing uh
[41:10] first king chapter 3
[41:12] because in chapter 3 then chapter 4 it
[41:15] mentioned a little bit about Solomon
[41:17] glory and then something caught my mind
[41:21] uh something caught my mind which of
[41:26] course we we may mention on that but
[41:28] let's just read
[41:30] uh
[41:33] first king
[41:34] chapter 3
[41:36] amen
[41:38] did I say first king chapter three Oh I
[41:41] thought I said Solomon Chapter 3.
[41:48] praise the Lord
[41:51] where you know that uh
[41:53] it would not be strange if I said
[41:55] Solomon Chapter 3.
[41:58] yeah
[41:59] praise the Lord
[42:02] amen let's read from verse 7.
[42:05] let's read from verse seven this great
[42:07] uh dream that Solomon had in prayer
[42:12] that he had let's just read that and
[42:15] then uh so tonight instead of talking
[42:19] about Solomon in all of his glory
[42:22] I really I really was I was going to
[42:25] bring a comparison about Solomon glory
[42:28] and the glory that came upon the temple
[42:31] because Jesus was the one that said that
[42:34] he said Solomon in order of his glory he
[42:37] was not a raid like one of the ladies
[42:40] that grew in a mod amen so I wanted to
[42:43] bring a comparison tonight and and talk
[42:46] about uh how God looks at the inner
[42:50] Glory that he puts upon the church even
[42:53] though we go through uh different and uh
[42:56] struggle you know in our faith in our
[42:59] health and different things but uh there
[43:03] is so much Glory that is better than
[43:06] than Solomon Glory that's why I wanted
[43:08] to go tonight but for some reason the
[43:11] Lord can afford uh moved my heart in
[43:13] this direction I I feel that it might it
[43:17] might come edifying for the service on
[43:19] Sunday so I don't know but let's just go
[43:21] this way praise the Lord verse 7
[43:25] and now oh Lord my God
[43:33] I will reread from verse five uh you
[43:36] give a good good thanks to you and give
[43:39] you and the Lord appeared unto Solomon
[43:41] in the dream by night
[43:43] and God said ask what I shall give thee
[43:47] and Solomon said thou art has shown unto
[43:50] thy servant David my father great Mercy
[43:54] I call in as he have walked before thee
[43:58] in truth and in righteousness
[44:00] and in uprightness of heart with deed
[44:03] and doubt has kept for him this great
[44:07] kindness
[44:09] that doubt have given him a son
[44:13] to sit on his throne
[44:15] as it is this day and now oh Lord my God
[44:19] thou has made
[44:23] thy seven King instead of David
[44:27] my father
[44:28] and I am but a little child I know not
[44:33] how to go out and come in and I seven is
[44:37] in the midst of thy people which thou
[44:41] has chosen a great people that cannot be
[44:44] number non-counted for multitude give
[44:47] therefore there are seven and
[44:49] understanding how to judge the people
[44:52] that I may discern between good and bad
[44:57] uh for who is able to judge this great
[45:02] this that is so great a people and the
[45:06] speech please the Lord that Solomon has
[45:08] asked this thing and God said unto him
[45:12] because thou has asked this thing and
[45:16] and have not asked for thyself long life
[45:19] neither have asked riches for thyself
[45:22] none have asked the life of that enemy
[45:26] but
[45:28] here is even God said we know sometimes
[45:30] we will ask the life of our enemy
[45:33] praise the Lord
[45:36] amen
[45:40] none have asked the life of that enemy
[45:43] but have asked
[45:45] for thyself understanding to discern
[45:48] judgment we want to talk about
[45:50] Discerning judgment tonight the Lord
[45:52] bless you have your seat we will
[45:53] continue to read amen
[45:55] we will continue to read right from
[45:58] there let's just Keeper
[46:00] in the scripture
[46:04] praise the Lord let's just keep writing
[46:07] the scripture there
[46:09] praise the Lord
[46:11] are we together
[46:15] or home
[46:33] okay let's let's continue to read
[46:37] verse 12 behold I have done I calling
[46:42] not that I will do
[46:44] now so a principle yet I want for us to
[46:47] see and I said it the last time uh
[46:52] uh
[46:54] God knows our heart he discerns our
[46:57] heart amen
[46:59] so we have to realize yet is the other
[47:02] Solomon asking this thing expressed what
[47:06] his heart is
[47:09] praise the Lord
[47:11] if if we are asking
[47:14] contrary to what our heart are we we
[47:17] might sound good in our in our
[47:20] expression to the Lord we might we might
[47:23] be thinking you know uh uh you know what
[47:27] but God knows what our heart is
[47:31] so see he's telling Solomon not that I
[47:34] would do what you have asked but I've
[47:36] already done it
[47:42] amen
[47:44] I've already done it it's it's one of
[47:47] these places where uh
[47:49] uh you know uh uh
[47:53] Laisa saying the woman that will come
[47:56] out and and give me the uh my cannabis
[47:58] some water and yeah Elizabeth I mean uh
[48:01] Rebecca comes and directly she goes to
[48:04] feed the candy so it is it is right here
[48:07] where a man finding the heart of God a
[48:11] man saying something that we pleases the
[48:14] Lord amen
[48:16] just like when David prayed and he says
[48:18] my God my God why they have forsaken me
[48:22] those that were in the temple they would
[48:24] think that they were oh my goodness what
[48:25] is this guy saying God has been good to
[48:27] him
[48:28] you know but their prayer pleased the
[48:31] Lord so much until Jesus could pick it
[48:34] up and if you realize that was one of
[48:36] the prophecy that deliver our lord Jesus
[48:39] when David said he will not leave his
[48:41] holy one to see corruption
[48:44] so David prayer became a prophecy
[48:48] it was pleasing to God
[48:51] so that that is that is the that is the
[48:53] thought year a man saying something that
[48:56] is pleasing to God both our heart and
[49:00] mind
[49:01] and tongue all lining up together
[49:07] before I have done I call into that
[49:10] verse Lord I I have given thee a wise
[49:14] and an understanding heart so that there
[49:17] is no like thee be there is none like
[49:21] thee before thee neither after the shall
[49:24] any arise like unto them and I I have
[49:29] also given thee that which they'll have
[49:32] not asked both riches and honors so that
[49:36] there shall not be any among the Kings
[49:40] like unto thee all that verse and if
[49:44] thou will walk in my ways to keep my
[49:48] status and my commandment as thy father
[49:51] David did walk then I will lengthen that
[49:55] days
[49:56] so Solomon a walk
[49:58] and behold
[50:00] it was a dream
[50:03] and and he came to Jerusalem and stood
[50:07] before the act of the Covenant of the
[50:10] law to offer burn offering
[50:13] and and peace offering and made a feast
[50:17] to all his servants
[50:20] now this verse also bring another
[50:23] thought to the story
[50:26] Solomon is having the dream
[50:28] actually all of this is taking place in
[50:31] his subconscious it's not like he's
[50:33] actually praying before the Lord but see
[50:35] his attitude
[50:37] coming out of such a spiritual dream
[50:41] he goes straight to the house of the
[50:43] Lord
[50:45] praise the Lord
[50:48] it's almost to say that I was not even
[50:51] taking on this Lord and what what a
[50:54] dream
[50:55] bring to pass what I have dreamed
[50:58] tonight
[51:01] he went straight to the house of the
[51:03] Lord he went right before the Ark of the
[51:05] Covenant his pray his hands to God
[51:10] praise the Lord
[51:13] and thanking God and saying now our Lord
[51:16] thank you for giving me such a spiritual
[51:18] dream I think that should be our
[51:21] attitude
[51:22] now watch now this is the thing that
[51:26] caught my attention
[51:29] he just had a dream the Bible says he
[51:33] went to the house of the Lord he went
[51:34] before the Ark of the Covenant and he he
[51:37] offered brain offering and peace
[51:39] offering and he may Feast to all his
[51:42] seven
[51:43] then came there are two women
[51:47] that were halots
[51:49] praise the Lord
[51:51] on to the king and stood before him
[51:55] now as I was as I was playing the the
[51:59] scripture War coming to church and and
[52:02] thinking about this what caught my mind
[52:04] here is the other see how the holy
[52:08] spirit is joining the two scene together
[52:12] in my mind Solomon just had a dream
[52:16] think about the whole base activity now
[52:18] he gathered from bed I believe he took a
[52:21] shower and got himself ready and said I
[52:24] must I must go to the house of the Lord
[52:25] he went over to the house of the Lord
[52:27] and you have to realize that these two
[52:31] women never came to the house of the
[52:33] Lord they never came to the to the to
[52:35] the temple or the Tabernacle to meet
[52:37] Solomon no they went over to his place
[52:40] now but what he's saying here is that
[52:42] the holy spirit is bringing is merging
[52:46] this scene to be able to vindicate what
[52:49] God had just said to Solomon
[52:53] so God is putting an event
[52:59] to show that and I will I will give you
[53:03] wisdom
[53:06] so the Holy Spirit now is giving us an
[53:08] Evidence
[53:10] of Solomon wisdom
[53:13] praise the Lord you read the verse as if
[53:16] to say is an immediate effect
[53:21] Noble is God's choosing a sin
[53:25] to be able to vindicate what he have
[53:28] already said
[53:30] that I will give you wisdom
[53:35] praise the Lord because you have not
[53:37] asked for long life neither acts for
[53:40] riches for thyself-known asks for the
[53:42] life of the enemy but you have you have
[53:46] asked for thyself
[53:49] understanding to discern judgment
[53:53] praise the Lord now God now is is is
[53:57] he's now going to show us
[54:01] what an understanding heart is
[54:05] now going to show us how we can bring
[54:11] right judgment
[54:15] praise the Lord
[54:17] because you have to know the man that
[54:19] brings judgment he's like a mediator
[54:23] and a worker for mediator is is a
[54:26] difficult work
[54:28] because by human nature we term to be
[54:31] buyers
[54:34] amen
[54:36] we turn to be biased the first person
[54:38] that you know tell their story is easy
[54:40] to fall for that story until you hear
[54:43] the other person's storage
[54:45] and then uh you know you you start to
[54:49] look at the condition and I mean that's
[54:50] that just that just human nature but by
[54:53] the Holy Spirit we are not supposed to
[54:55] be biased we're supposed to judge by the
[54:57] word of God Amen we're supposed to
[54:59] rightly Josh by the word of God but see
[55:02] that's that's the thing that caught my
[55:04] mind that's that's the thing that uh
[55:06] that that was just dwelling on my mind I
[55:09] ran straight to the to the office and
[55:12] and I just prayed I said Lord I don't
[55:14] know about I will I will get away uh
[55:16] from what I had on my heart to speak
[55:18] tonight and just look at this Discerning
[55:21] judgment
[55:22] if I if I turn out to be long and then
[55:25] it's by mistake
[55:27] but I hope not to be long let's read one
[55:30] verse here over in Hebrew
[55:32] Hebrew chapter 4.
[55:36] Hebrew chapter four
[55:43] Hebrew chapter 4 verse 14. seeing then
[55:47] that we have a great high priest
[55:52] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[55:55] the son of God
[55:57] let us hold fast our profession
[56:01] that's how fast our confession
[56:04] amen
[56:06] for we have not and high priests which
[56:09] can now be touched with the feelings of
[56:13] our infremities
[56:17] but was in all Point tempted like as we
[56:22] are yet with our sin
[56:24] praise the Lord so Paul is saying that
[56:28] what make Jesus high priest work
[56:31] effective is because he can be touched
[56:35] by the feelings of our infirmities
[56:39] so it make his high pre-work effective
[56:42] it makes him to rightly intercede for us
[56:45] because he knows what we are going
[56:48] through
[56:51] praise the Lord so he can rightly judge
[56:55] our matter
[56:56] because he's not he's not in general a
[56:59] sense he's not looking at the heart was
[57:02] seen he's looking at the inward emotions
[57:11] are we together
[57:13] he can be touched by the feelings of our
[57:17] infremities so God here is showing
[57:22] Discerning judgment the gift of this
[57:25] sermon
[57:27] you will see that's the reason why the
[57:30] gift of this sermon one do not discern
[57:34] their own needs
[57:36] the gift of discernment that the Lord
[57:39] told Brother they gave us for the people
[57:41] was not for him he went he went many
[57:44] years with a stomach ache
[57:47] and yet he was Discerning people and
[57:49] telling them what was their problem and
[57:51] praying for them and Jerry said he's
[57:54] dying with a stomach ache because the
[57:57] gift of discernment is always for the
[57:59] people
[58:02] so you see God is now showing us here
[58:08] praise the Lord
[58:10] how to discern judgment simple
[58:14] will bring a lot of different stories to
[58:16] you recourse to you how to discern
[58:19] judgment is to step in the shoes of
[58:21] others
[58:23] simple
[58:26] that's what make our lord Jesus work
[58:29] effective is What feelings
[58:34] feelings he's touched by the feelings of
[58:37] our infirmities
[58:40] there is nothing that we are going
[58:42] through mentally emotionally half-wise
[58:45] that he's not touched by
[58:51] praise the Lord so if we can confess it
[58:54] to him
[58:55] if we can confess it if we can see it
[58:58] just like we are going through it
[59:01] then you can put him to work because he
[59:04] already know what you are going through
[59:07] now what makes the work hard for him is
[59:10] when you are saying something completely
[59:12] different from what you are going
[59:14] through
[59:15] then you make the work difficult for him
[59:19] because he already knows what you're
[59:21] going through
[59:23] he already knows what's on your mind you
[59:25] already know uh you know all the things
[59:28] that uh you know uh uh bothering you and
[59:32] and even all the good things that you
[59:34] are also appreciating of his grace he
[59:37] knows everything
[59:40] are we together
[59:42] so here is God now telling uh Solomon
[59:46] placing this before Solomon
[59:49] that I'm going to give you I'm going to
[59:52] give you this gift
[59:54] it is God's gift
[59:56] God becoming man
[59:59] God leaving
[1:00:02] his holy State and dropping in an ethnic
[1:00:06] body
[1:00:08] praise the Lord
[1:00:11] that's the greatest gift God coming down
[1:00:18] to to live like them feel feel their
[1:00:21] pains he says I'm going to give you this
[1:00:23] gift
[1:00:25] since you you didn't ask for riches and
[1:00:28] uh I'm going to give you this gift and
[1:00:31] what this gift is
[1:00:40] what this give this Discerning judgment
[1:00:43] now so wash wash the scene here now
[1:00:46] that's the reason why you see that's
[1:00:49] that's why brother Brahm says God
[1:00:50] interpret his own word
[1:00:52] that's the reason why the Holy Spirit
[1:00:54] put this encounter in the scripture
[1:00:58] because how was Solomon George this
[1:01:00] matter
[1:01:01] how did he came to a judgment all
[1:01:04] Solomon was looking for is that which
[1:01:06] one of these women really have feelings
[1:01:11] they're how he judged the matter their
[1:01:13] sort of woman says uh uh you know we
[1:01:16] were sleeping there and and you can you
[1:01:18] can already know that she's the fourth
[1:01:20] one because she's doing all the talking
[1:01:25] she's doing all the talking
[1:01:27] we were sleeping there and and just one
[1:01:30] sleep over my child I wake up and my
[1:01:32] child is dead she's doing all the
[1:01:34] talking
[1:01:37] praise the Lord
[1:01:39] the prophet of God says he says those
[1:01:42] men of all those apart Apostles they
[1:01:45] were men of few words
[1:01:48] he said because there was there was
[1:01:50] there was just a whole lot of her burden
[1:01:52] that was on the heart they spent time
[1:01:55] doing all their talking on their knees
[1:01:58] they spend time doing their talking
[1:01:59] before God
[1:02:03] they didn't have time for who says what
[1:02:07] they didn't have time to to justify
[1:02:09] themselves and and defend themselves
[1:02:11] they'd go on their knees
[1:02:15] praise the Lord so you can always you
[1:02:17] can already see that she was the faulty
[1:02:19] one because she's the one that is not
[1:02:20] written
[1:02:23] the only time The Other Woman spoke that
[1:02:26] was the real mother
[1:02:28] when she said no my Lord she can have
[1:02:30] the child
[1:02:33] that was the only time she spoke
[1:02:37] and God these uh designed a judgment he
[1:02:41] he gave Solomon such a judgment without
[1:02:45] smiling you know he just listened to the
[1:02:48] story come take the baby take the baby
[1:02:50] just play the baby in two and uh uh uh
[1:02:54] you know uh he's he's giving command
[1:02:57] he's talking to them and and uh you know
[1:02:59] uh
[1:03:03] just to watch
[1:03:08] and all he was looking for
[1:03:12] was feelings
[1:03:18] all he was looking for
[1:03:20] was feelings
[1:03:24] praise the Lord
[1:03:26] and you cannot rightly judge if you have
[1:03:31] lost feeling
[1:03:36] if you allow the Martyr to get the best
[1:03:39] of you
[1:03:41] that you lost feelings
[1:03:44] you get into a place where
[1:03:47] you don't uh I mean it's it's all about
[1:03:51] you and you don't care about who says
[1:03:54] watching and and you just go on and on
[1:03:57] and on and on
[1:03:59] praise the Lord
[1:04:06] are we together
[1:04:11] even our lord Jesus
[1:04:15] in his mediatory work
[1:04:21] the only quality that he keeps that
[1:04:23] connect us with him
[1:04:25] is his feelings
[1:04:34] praise the Lord
[1:04:37] that he's touch
[1:04:40] feelings
[1:04:42] of our information
[1:04:47] are we together
[1:04:52] now so uh
[1:04:57] you just look at this
[1:05:00] and you see yeah you know he he give
[1:05:03] this great discernment and then and this
[1:05:06] or this other woman woke up out of me
[1:05:08] and she she went
[1:05:10] uh
[1:05:18] the Bible says here in in the last two
[1:05:20] verse of chapter 3 then the king
[1:05:24] answered and said give her the living
[1:05:27] child
[1:05:28] and in in in you know why slay it she is
[1:05:32] the mother thereof
[1:05:34] and because she she expressed a Feeling
[1:05:38] uh
[1:05:41] praise the Lord because uh that's that's
[1:05:43] one of the things that go goes with
[1:05:46] motherhood praise the Lord I mean uh is
[1:05:49] is is an instant of love that that a
[1:05:52] woman have for any child
[1:05:55] praise the Lord
[1:06:00] I mean even before she she she entered
[1:06:03] into that motherhood it naturally comes
[1:06:06] she loved doors and and I mean she take
[1:06:09] care of them just like they are living
[1:06:10] being
[1:06:11] they are not even uh one Chinese man
[1:06:14] make their daughter and put in the store
[1:06:16] that your mama buy for you and you love
[1:06:19] it
[1:06:24] praise the Lord
[1:06:27] so even if that was not her child she
[1:06:30] had the character to be the best mother
[1:06:33] to that child
[1:06:40] and the scripture says and and and and
[1:06:43] and all Israel heard the Judgment which
[1:06:46] the King has George
[1:06:48] and the fear the king
[1:06:52] and instant fear came on the people
[1:06:55] see how God works all God have to do is
[1:06:59] to just do something miraculous once in
[1:07:03] the midst of the people
[1:07:05] praise the Lord
[1:07:07] in the early church the people there the
[1:07:09] church is growing in you know and people
[1:07:11] are coming in and they miss multitude
[1:07:13] and people having attitude and all of
[1:07:16] that God it was just one service
[1:07:21] with ananias falling dead
[1:07:27] and the Bible says fear cut the people
[1:07:29] because now they know that
[1:07:32] that God is in their mess
[1:07:38] praise the Lord
[1:07:43] just one thing that God will do
[1:07:50] the people love and and and uh David and
[1:07:53] fear him for his War skill yes Solomon
[1:07:56] he's he's just a teenager
[1:07:58] Solomon was just a teenager
[1:08:03] and God is trusting him with with this
[1:08:06] uh responsibility but you see God will
[1:08:10] move in such a way and he will do
[1:08:12] something
[1:08:14] that will make the people not to despise
[1:08:17] his youth
[1:08:21] praise the Lord
[1:08:24] wow how did he know that I mean there
[1:08:28] was no DNA they couldn't do DNA then and
[1:08:30] to prove DNA and wait for DNA test and
[1:08:33] and all of that
[1:08:34] there was no time for that
[1:08:38] but just that judgment anybody in their
[1:08:42] right mind
[1:08:43] will say oh yeah right yeah I never
[1:08:46] thought about it but uh I mean he's
[1:08:47] right
[1:08:52] now I don't want my she must she must be
[1:08:54] put in prison
[1:08:56] she must be charged and condemned for
[1:08:58] everything she accused her friend
[1:09:01] how does she know that a woman slept on
[1:09:03] her baby if she was sleeping
[1:09:10] praise the Lord
[1:09:13] so sometimes when we do too much talking
[1:09:15] before you finish doing while you're
[1:09:16] talking you finish implicating yourself
[1:09:20] Infinity telling all your story
[1:09:24] are we together
[1:09:26] and all Israel heard of the Judgment
[1:09:29] which the King has judged and the fear
[1:09:33] the king for they saw that the wisdom of
[1:09:37] God
[1:09:38] was in him
[1:09:42] to do judgment
[1:09:46] they realized that this teenager
[1:09:51] this teenager praise the Lord
[1:09:55] can you imagine
[1:09:58] how the people will walk before Solomon
[1:10:00] to realize that he he having social
[1:10:03] wisdom
[1:10:09] and they will be talking as soon as the
[1:10:11] year that they can come let's let's keep
[1:10:13] quiet because that guy when he look at
[1:10:16] you in your face he can tell straight
[1:10:17] what is in your mind
[1:10:22] praise the Lord
[1:10:25] he just brought such a gift
[1:10:27] and he arrested the people
[1:10:31] and it humble the people
[1:10:34] it's not the man that humble the people
[1:10:35] is the gift
[1:10:37] is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:40] are we together
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:43] but you see
[1:10:46] God teaching us the gift of discernment
[1:10:51] you know people want the gift of
[1:10:53] discernment like I said the last time
[1:10:54] and I mean people anything because
[1:10:58] there's there is there is there is there
[1:11:00] have never been a time in all of church
[1:11:02] history
[1:11:04] look a man like FF boss wolf
[1:11:08] and the boss were brother those were men
[1:11:10] that were on the field they were
[1:11:12] preaching the gospel those were people
[1:11:14] that believed in Divine Healing
[1:11:20] but church history will tell you there
[1:11:23] have never been a time where the gift of
[1:11:27] discernment was so accurate now there is
[1:11:30] somebody in here that have had it no
[1:11:33] your name was called your address was
[1:11:37] given
[1:11:39] not only that thy gift will go back in
[1:11:43] your life
[1:11:44] and tell you when you were a child how
[1:11:46] you came to that condition
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:51] is so much when FF bustle ever Boswell
[1:11:54] have already gone into retirement he has
[1:11:56] left the fee from preaching
[1:11:59] he was a fit preacher he was a man I
[1:12:02] believe in Divine Healing but when he
[1:12:04] sat in brother Brandon meetings and he
[1:12:07] saw the gift of discernment that all man
[1:12:09] got so energized he said this is the
[1:12:13] thing that we were waiting for
[1:12:17] and he came out of retirement and got
[1:12:19] right back into the field
[1:12:22] praise the Lord
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:26] now never been a time and and and many
[1:12:29] of us
[1:12:31] some of us that never even tasted
[1:12:33] Pentecost
[1:12:34] to know what what what actually the
[1:12:37] Pentecostal blessing is
[1:12:39] our morning Pentecostal Church they have
[1:12:41] turned to Prosperity Church but I mean
[1:12:44] what actually the Pentecostal blessing
[1:12:46] is
[1:12:47] praise the Lord
[1:12:48] because in the Pentecostal church I'm
[1:12:50] telling you uh I mean the gifts were
[1:12:53] among the people
[1:12:55] until even when the preacher comes to
[1:12:57] the pulpit he has to come anointed and
[1:13:00] with the right life
[1:13:02] because all mother will sit right there
[1:13:04] and break on a vision and say that man
[1:13:06] is not qualified to preach to us
[1:13:09] just last night you were on the street
[1:13:11] running after the girl
[1:13:16] praise the Lord
[1:13:19] and we come coming to the to the to the
[1:13:21] message of the hour and and and and in
[1:13:24] tips we we hear those uh uh discernment
[1:13:27] meetings and we read them in bulk and
[1:13:29] pretty soon you know while uh people
[1:13:32] break into impersonation
[1:13:37] praise the Lord
[1:13:39] now you think about it God is telling
[1:13:41] Solomon here I will give you this gift
[1:13:44] there have never been a man before you
[1:13:48] all they have never there will never be
[1:13:50] the man after you Jesus came and broke
[1:13:53] that ring when he says the greater than
[1:13:55] Solomon is here
[1:13:57] so if that gift will ever be manifested
[1:14:00] it will have to be the spirit of Jesus
[1:14:02] Christ back in the church
[1:14:09] are we together
[1:14:11] praise the Lord
[1:14:13] but even see our lord Jesus
[1:14:17] see our lord Jesus
[1:14:21] look at the woman with the blood issue
[1:14:24] how did she connect you with him
[1:14:26] feelings
[1:14:27] she just touched him
[1:14:31] praise the Lord
[1:14:34] and the Bible says she's she started in
[1:14:37] the scripture as a certain woman
[1:14:39] they had the Bible call her
[1:14:42] but when Jesus turned and descended her
[1:14:44] he said daughter
[1:14:47] she started as a certain woman she end
[1:14:50] up as a daughter
[1:14:57] he was more effective because he could
[1:15:00] step in the shoes of the people
[1:15:05] praise the Lord
[1:15:08] that's the effect that that is the power
[1:15:11] of the gift of discernment is to step in
[1:15:14] people's shoes not psychology
[1:15:18] not said that and read their minds
[1:15:21] or sit there and think okay okay okay I
[1:15:25] know where they are going oh I've heard
[1:15:28] this before I've seen this before it
[1:15:30] does not work like that that's not the
[1:15:32] gift of discernment
[1:15:37] you have to step in the person's shoes
[1:15:44] praise the Lord
[1:15:49] glory be to God
[1:15:55] he stepped in our shoes
[1:15:57] when he took on a 16 element body
[1:16:02] when he took on a human body he stepped
[1:16:05] he came down from Glory
[1:16:07] in our shoes born of a woman
[1:16:11] cry like a baby
[1:16:14] and was tempted in every way
[1:16:17] the Bible says yes without sin
[1:16:20] why he had to do that
[1:16:24] because he wanted to be touched when we
[1:16:28] are going through what we are going
[1:16:29] through
[1:16:32] he wanted to field it
[1:16:34] so he got the feeling from the womb to
[1:16:37] the Grave
[1:16:39] he did not Escape one
[1:16:43] he know what it is when the core body is
[1:16:46] laying down in the grave and he knew
[1:16:48] exactly what it is when he raised up
[1:16:50] from the grave also
[1:16:52] praise the Lord he knows what the agony
[1:16:55] of death is
[1:17:02] praise the Lord he's touched by the
[1:17:05] feelings of our infirmities
[1:17:08] so as I was looking at there tonight
[1:17:12] try to bring you up to a close here make
[1:17:15] sure I try to finish it by nine o'clock
[1:17:17] amen
[1:17:19] so I can allow you to go home and now I
[1:17:23] thought about this
[1:17:25] and uh I have a few coats up there from
[1:17:29] the message standing in the Gap well
[1:17:31] better Brandon will bring us his own
[1:17:33] life experience
[1:17:35] when he got to the place
[1:17:38] of losing the feelings for the people
[1:17:44] praise the Lord
[1:17:48] this prophet of God with the greatest
[1:17:50] gift in his life he took a complex but
[1:17:55] Abraham says what made him to get to
[1:17:57] that place was a complex
[1:17:59] he took a complex
[1:18:02] and complex
[1:18:04] will run you out of feeling
[1:18:09] complex will run you out of feelings
[1:18:15] when you take a complex
[1:18:17] that they don't love me
[1:18:19] he should start running out of feelings
[1:18:22] for your parents and make children to be
[1:18:24] disrespectful
[1:18:26] it may cause my wife to get into
[1:18:28] problems
[1:18:30] and even affect us when if the devil can
[1:18:34] feel with the thought that God don't
[1:18:35] love you see what you are going through
[1:18:38] then pretty soon you have you have no
[1:18:41] drive you have no strength to worship
[1:18:43] Him you just show up in the form and you
[1:18:46] don't even care
[1:18:51] praise the Lord oh I wish we can take
[1:18:54] time and talk on complex and just break
[1:18:56] it down I don't have time tonight I will
[1:18:58] stay with this and then that's a recipe
[1:19:00] for the northern night amen praise the
[1:19:03] Lord
[1:19:05] Hallelujah
[1:19:10] the prophet of God got to this place
[1:19:13] brother Brown says how how did he got
[1:19:15] that he says uh uh uh he got to that
[1:19:18] place
[1:19:20] because
[1:19:22] he Fair used by the people
[1:19:28] he Fair used by the people in a sense
[1:19:31] where the people only wanted him
[1:19:35] to discern their knees and pray for
[1:19:37] their sake
[1:19:39] but they were despising the words he
[1:19:41] were preaching
[1:19:44] they called him electric on learn
[1:19:50] they would not want to receive the truth
[1:19:52] from such an electric man
[1:19:54] but when they have sick need right
[1:19:56] around come and pray for my sake
[1:20:00] so he Fair used
[1:20:05] and God gave him a complex
[1:20:11] praise the Lord
[1:20:16] glory be to God
[1:20:18] amen
[1:20:22] being born on of our natural birth we
[1:20:24] are already born in complex
[1:20:26] so complex is is one of the easiest
[1:20:29] thing to pick up
[1:20:30] it's so easy to pick complex
[1:20:33] very easy
[1:20:35] I don't care who you think you are it's
[1:20:37] easier to pick up a complex
[1:20:43] praise the Lord
[1:20:46] because you see a a complex
[1:20:50] it's easily built under the sense of
[1:20:53] rejection
[1:20:55] when a person feels like they are
[1:20:57] rejected
[1:21:00] then it's easy for them to pick up a
[1:21:02] complex
[1:21:05] a person can feel rejected just by look
[1:21:08] the way he looked at me wow
[1:21:16] praise the Lord
[1:21:18] it's just so easy
[1:21:21] you don't have to say I reject you no
[1:21:25] just by look
[1:21:29] praise the Lord
[1:21:32] I told you about a story about my cross
[1:21:34] eye so
[1:21:36] if my lock is offending you just tell
[1:21:39] yourself your brother won't have a cross
[1:21:40] eye
[1:21:43] because sometimes I'm not even looking
[1:21:44] your way
[1:21:50] praise the Lord
[1:21:54] the natural birth put us in that
[1:21:57] condition
[1:22:01] praise the Lord
[1:22:05] we love birth under the original word
[1:22:07] that God designed for us to come so with
[1:22:10] with all the the the the the chromosomes
[1:22:13] from our mom and dad and Grand and all
[1:22:15] the genes that is running down from
[1:22:17] ground we just in that mix so complex is
[1:22:19] an easy thing to build easy
[1:22:29] but here is the reason why the devil
[1:22:31] uses complex
[1:22:33] is because he wants to get you out of
[1:22:36] touch
[1:22:38] because if he can get you out of touch
[1:22:41] and isolates you then he can work on
[1:22:44] your mind and destroy you
[1:22:52] so let's just read a few years from
[1:22:53] brother Brandon I have a few minutes
[1:22:55] here and then I'll let you go tonight
[1:22:57] praise the Lord
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:03] can we say thank you Jesus
[1:23:06] amen
[1:23:10] now brother Rod Robertson have told
[1:23:12] Brother Branham a dream
[1:23:15] he had told brother Brandon be dreaming
[1:23:17] and I might read something to you coming
[1:23:19] up here to be able to show you some
[1:23:22] paints
[1:23:23] that uh
[1:23:25] that man of God went true
[1:23:27] and and it helps to be able to learn
[1:23:31] praise the Lord
[1:23:33] because sometimes people that don't
[1:23:35] learn and know these things they get to
[1:23:37] the place of deifying brother Branham no
[1:23:40] he was a man he had to learn now Rob
[1:23:44] Robertson told him a dream
[1:23:46] that he was going to be stunning it was
[1:23:48] a dream or a vision he was that he was
[1:23:50] going to be standing like Moses he never
[1:23:52] understood what that was
[1:23:57] until he started dealing with this
[1:23:59] complex
[1:24:04] are we together
[1:24:08] standing in the Gap do you remember what
[1:24:10] uh brother Robertson told you in a dream
[1:24:12] he says the Lord was reminding him now
[1:24:15] in his dream or the vision that you have
[1:24:18] you had don't like Moses
[1:24:20] you have you have forgot the feeling of
[1:24:24] the people now that Direct
[1:24:27] instruction was not in the dream
[1:24:32] brother Branham is interpreting he's
[1:24:34] saying that now because he understood
[1:24:38] what the dream made
[1:24:42] are we together
[1:24:46] you have forgot the feelings of the
[1:24:48] people you forgot
[1:24:49] the call that I call you to
[1:24:54] let the sick laid
[1:24:57] I want the Lord to tell me where to go
[1:25:00] or not that's wrong
[1:25:02] I have built myself a complex because
[1:25:05] the people didn't hear my message
[1:25:09] and God forbid that I I would try to
[1:25:13] compare
[1:25:15] the life
[1:25:17] of now like Moses but it's exactly what
[1:25:22] Moses did
[1:25:23] the people won't listen to him
[1:25:26] when he come to deliver them
[1:25:30] so he just he just left him alone and
[1:25:34] went into the wilderness
[1:25:37] but God turned him around
[1:25:40] and he how long forgot the suffering of
[1:25:44] the people
[1:25:46] because he went away for 40 years
[1:25:49] praise the Lord
[1:25:51] so when he came back this time he was
[1:25:54] not connected to the suffering of the
[1:25:56] people
[1:25:59] because remember he was he was in the
[1:26:01] palace in each in in Egypt
[1:26:04] when he stepped out of Palace out of the
[1:26:07] palace the very little time that he
[1:26:09] spent with the people it was when he
[1:26:11] sensed that Rejection it says we'll make
[1:26:12] you Lord
[1:26:13] over us are you a judge or a lord over
[1:26:16] us do you want to kill us like you did
[1:26:18] that Egyptian
[1:26:20] he took his feet
[1:26:22] praise the Lord
[1:26:26] he picked his feet up into the
[1:26:28] Wilderness he went
[1:26:30] are we together
[1:26:33] so he didn't know the suffering of the
[1:26:35] people
[1:26:37] now he's coming back with a Divine gift
[1:26:42] but with mixed feeling
[1:26:45] praise the Lord
[1:26:47] he remembered Egypt for the evil that
[1:26:50] they have done to the Hebrews
[1:26:52] when he remembered his own people he
[1:26:54] remembered the rejection
[1:26:59] praise the Lord
[1:27:03] Hallelujah so can you can you imagine
[1:27:05] after Moses went to meet Pharaoh the
[1:27:08] first time and they had to increase the
[1:27:11] burden and the labor of the people
[1:27:14] what a place it put him
[1:27:18] praise the Lord
[1:27:21] and everybody's saying why you even came
[1:27:23] back here for it was better you were you
[1:27:26] were dead in the wilderness you have you
[1:27:27] had just come to increase our labor and
[1:27:29] everything
[1:27:34] but if he never met the Bernie bulge
[1:27:38] that's where the burning bush experience
[1:27:40] make the difference
[1:27:42] if he never met the burning bush
[1:27:45] if it was not in reality that he threw
[1:27:48] his rod on the ground and pick up a
[1:27:50] stepping all the raw turned into a
[1:27:52] serpent and he had to pick it up again
[1:27:54] for it to be a rod in his hand if he
[1:27:57] never had an experience of putting his
[1:27:59] hands in his court and taking our lepers
[1:28:04] he will not stay another day
[1:28:08] praise the Lord he said that's what the
[1:28:10] burning bush experienced that's what the
[1:28:12] Holy Ghost does even when even when it
[1:28:14] seems like we are failing he gave us
[1:28:17] strength to stand there and face the
[1:28:19] failure
[1:28:21] when it seems like we are rejected he
[1:28:24] still gave us the grace
[1:28:26] when it seems like the people are not
[1:28:28] hearing he still gives an anointing for
[1:28:30] you to preach to them
[1:28:35] amen
[1:28:37] praise the Lord but it's a different
[1:28:39] thing when the anointing words out
[1:28:42] and you have to go home
[1:28:44] and start to think about all of that
[1:28:50] after being burned out
[1:28:53] after everything you put in
[1:28:56] and to know that
[1:28:59] the people
[1:29:01] don't want to heal
[1:29:07] praise the Lord
[1:29:10] if God don't call you you will use your
[1:29:12] teeth to dig your grave
[1:29:14] oh
[1:29:16] Moses lost the feeling of of his people
[1:29:19] because they wouldn't listen to him
[1:29:23] praise the Lord
[1:29:25] just at the time where God will
[1:29:27] vindicate him
[1:29:30] and the people will start saying the
[1:29:31] hand of the Lord the supernatural
[1:29:34] all he is gaining courage
[1:29:38] he's getting courage he's getting
[1:29:39] acceptance of the people
[1:29:43] you see that's the reason why I said
[1:29:44] it's not the things we are saying with
[1:29:46] our mouth all we are thinking in our
[1:29:49] mind is the thing that is down in our
[1:29:50] heart
[1:29:53] because pretty soon all of those people
[1:29:55] they started rallying around oh thank
[1:29:57] God for Moses Moses you're you're
[1:29:59] showing to them and they are talking all
[1:30:01] of that but it will not be after a few
[1:30:03] days there will be the very same people
[1:30:06] that once again
[1:30:08] will be showing a sense of rejection
[1:30:14] he brought us in the wilderness to die
[1:30:19] on and on and on and on Moses will deal
[1:30:22] with rejection constant rejection from
[1:30:25] the people
[1:30:27] until that prophet of God will lose it
[1:30:31] and say you rebels
[1:30:39] and in a natural sense he would lose his
[1:30:41] reward of taking the people over
[1:30:45] you can take that in a natural sense but
[1:30:48] that was the end of his ministry his
[1:30:49] ministry will continue because he was a
[1:30:52] type of Christ
[1:30:55] so Joshua is the Holy Ghost type of
[1:30:58] Christ
[1:30:59] amen that's what in Joshua chapter 1 the
[1:31:03] uh the Lord will tell Joshua as ours
[1:31:05] with Moses
[1:31:07] so will I be with you
[1:31:10] are we together
[1:31:13] but that constant sense of rejection
[1:31:19] how Moses would deal with that
[1:31:24] he couldn't even stand the first
[1:31:26] rejection
[1:31:27] so much that he said God I can't talk
[1:31:30] he only said he can talk because he did
[1:31:32] not wanted to stand before the people
[1:31:40] so God has to give him a shared Aaron
[1:31:43] will be your spoke man
[1:31:46] praise the Lord
[1:31:53] Moses lost the feeling of the people
[1:31:55] let's get this down so we can close up
[1:31:58] here tonight we're having more days to
[1:31:59] preach because they wouldn't listen to
[1:32:02] him
[1:32:03] now brother Rod you see it you see your
[1:32:06] dream
[1:32:07] and uh
[1:32:09] and now I cannot go with a Ministry like
[1:32:12] that until I feel different in my heart
[1:32:15] about it
[1:32:16] no matter if God
[1:32:19] did tell me
[1:32:21] but that is
[1:32:23] but that is that uh change that uh that
[1:32:27] brother wrote
[1:32:28] the same coming something God to change
[1:32:31] me because uh in my heart if I go out
[1:32:35] they're feeling the way that I do I
[1:32:39] still feel that they ought to have heard
[1:32:42] the message your superbrand is caught in
[1:32:44] this place
[1:32:46] because what what is happening here he's
[1:32:48] seeing the change of the ministry
[1:32:51] he's entering into his stair pool is
[1:32:54] going to be the word
[1:32:56] is not going to be all of these signs
[1:32:59] and one but the people keep pressing on
[1:33:01] him for signs and wonders you have seen
[1:33:04] the dead race
[1:33:06] you have seen cripples
[1:33:09] less growing out
[1:33:11] blinds eyes being created in the soccer
[1:33:14] in in the socket of their eyes
[1:33:16] why why can't the people just raise up
[1:33:19] with faith
[1:33:23] human being we just like drama
[1:33:27] we just like drama
[1:33:30] no matter how sign the word is preached
[1:33:32] we just like some kind of for
[1:33:34] performance
[1:33:36] praise the Lord
[1:33:39] because if we put a a a a a a tip to
[1:33:44] play tonight everybody with keyboard
[1:33:47] yes the word of God is is powerful
[1:33:51] but we will feeble on the table
[1:33:54] we just want some kind of a drama
[1:33:56] somebody doing like they say yeah
[1:33:59] let's see
[1:34:01] human being with light drama
[1:34:05] are we together
[1:34:09] hope we can get a right kind of for
[1:34:11] drama though
[1:34:16] so he's in this
[1:34:17] problem with him
[1:34:18] you know I have a message to give to the
[1:34:21] people
[1:34:23] what would turn the house of the
[1:34:24] children back to the father
[1:34:31] I must not be caught up in this place of
[1:34:33] just gifts and gifts and gifts
[1:34:37] praise the Lord Brother man will be
[1:34:39] preaching all of those uh Seminary
[1:34:41] preachers who put their hands in their
[1:34:43] pocket they walk out of the meetings as
[1:34:45] soon as he comes to prayer line and
[1:34:46] everybody come there sitting down
[1:34:48] attentively they are watching even close
[1:34:51] your eyes they will not close their eyes
[1:34:55] he will say buy your hairs and close
[1:34:57] your eyes they will not close your eyes
[1:35:02] praise the Lord
[1:35:04] and with all of those things that they
[1:35:06] saw the yet will not believe
[1:35:14] they are either opening their ass to
[1:35:15] look for fought
[1:35:17] to love for who name was called and go
[1:35:20] and ask that person
[1:35:27] but he was seeing the changes of his
[1:35:29] ministry
[1:35:31] he was saying where he got a story that
[1:35:34] he he got to give this food for the
[1:35:35] bride
[1:35:38] and the people are saying you're taking
[1:35:39] one hour two hours to preach
[1:35:43] praise the Lord
[1:35:46] you get sick people lying all before you
[1:35:50] go back and look at Allen
[1:35:54] video overview you don't even see the
[1:35:57] message
[1:35:59] they just come out there to read a
[1:36:00] scripture and write that or it's it's
[1:36:02] just all healing and praying for the
[1:36:05] sake
[1:36:06] but we have to realize we will get sick
[1:36:08] again
[1:36:10] praise the Lord
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:16] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:36:18] every word that proceed out of the mouth
[1:36:20] of God
[1:36:25] because when we are rightly taught in
[1:36:27] the word you don't have to wait for the
[1:36:30] Evangelist to come in town you know how
[1:36:32] to get a hold of God
[1:36:38] foreign
[1:36:45] need I really need help he's telling the
[1:36:48] church I really need her
[1:36:52] how much
[1:36:54] more of level of earnesty
[1:36:57] can we see from a man brother ban
[1:36:59] himself with a Divine gift that God has
[1:37:01] given me I could hold the Nations under
[1:37:04] my finger
[1:37:12] King George of England they had to fly
[1:37:15] him over to go and pray for him
[1:37:21] under my finger
[1:37:28] or if the people if that's if it is just
[1:37:30] all praying you want it's easy
[1:37:33] because he's born with a gift for vision
[1:37:36] but he knew what his calling was
[1:37:39] he knew what his responsibility is
[1:37:44] praise the Lord
[1:37:46] here on God under pressure
[1:37:49] by the people
[1:37:50] Moses staying long Iran Moses stay alone
[1:37:54] let Bill our own God
[1:37:56] before Moses would bring the word to
[1:37:58] them they have built a golden calf
[1:38:01] they have their own God they have their
[1:38:03] own Idol
[1:38:05] because their impatient nature of men
[1:38:09] to wait on God
[1:38:14] together
[1:38:17] he don't want to lose the feeling of the
[1:38:19] people so he he he he he got caught up
[1:38:22] by their pressure
[1:38:29] many people building idols
[1:38:33] in a home because they're looking for
[1:38:34] Supernatural they're looking for a
[1:38:36] vindication
[1:38:38] we already have a Vindicated message
[1:38:40] amen
[1:38:42] praise the Lord
[1:38:43] I don't need self-indication I have a
[1:38:46] Vindicated message that's enough for me
[1:38:49] I'll point you to all the Vindication in
[1:38:51] the word
[1:38:53] are we together
[1:38:58] he says I need that change in me
[1:39:01] I don't I don't want to be standing
[1:39:03] there praying for people and thinking in
[1:39:05] my mind that these people have rejected
[1:39:07] me I want a connection
[1:39:13] praise the Lord
[1:39:16] and the prophet of God will tell us
[1:39:20] is one of the rain that God broke into
[1:39:25] that's why he made the universe that's
[1:39:27] what he he brought for his attributes
[1:39:32] because he wanted to make contact
[1:39:36] with what he had in his mind
[1:39:39] praise the Lord
[1:39:41] every form of relationship
[1:39:46] if God lost feelings for us Good

[1:40:00] feelings of our infremities
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:07] we want him to be touched by the feeling
[1:40:09] that of the need of this church how much
[1:40:12] we need the Holy Ghost we need a new
[1:40:14] birth
[1:40:15] how much we need a spirit of conviction
[1:40:18] in our heart
[1:40:22] not just a claim without the reality
[1:40:27] may he be touched with the feelings of
[1:40:29] our infremities
[1:40:31] that's the thing that keeps life

[1:40:45] family the relationship going
[1:40:48] you lost feelings
[1:40:51] that's a cop
[1:40:53] cops ready for the mall ready to be
[1:40:55] buried they don't have feelings
[1:40:57] that's a dead body
[1:41:07] amen when we lost feelings for what God
[1:41:11] is doing in this building
[1:41:17] we are just only concerned about our own
[1:41:19] unique life
[1:41:24] praise the Lord
[1:41:27] Hallelujah
[1:41:29] amen I've I look up that story but Dan
[1:41:32] was talking dead about the the London
[1:41:34] Fire uh because I was blessed by that
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:40] and it's uh is is such a notable story
[1:41:45] it's written in many different articles
[1:41:51] about the three brake layers when that
[1:41:53] one says I'm building a cathedral
[1:42:00] praise the Lord
[1:42:04] while one was working for his family and
[1:42:06] one was working I mean maybe to secure
[1:42:08] himself a job
[1:42:11] they were all doing the same work
[1:42:15] but one had a heart
[1:42:17] to see a cathedral
[1:42:20] to find a place of worship
[1:42:23] praise the Lord
[1:42:27] whether we are sweeping or whatever we
[1:42:29] are doing
[1:42:32] that'll be our heart that we want to
[1:42:34] build a place
[1:42:35] for the presence of God
[1:42:39] I'm coming here because I want to be a
[1:42:41] place I want to be part of what God is
[1:42:43] doing here
[1:42:47] you know
[1:42:49] it's not that selfish saying I want to
[1:42:51] come here to serve my God carry your God
[1:42:53] we don't need it here we have only one
[1:42:55] God
[1:42:56] and that's the Living God
[1:42:59] when people don't want to listen to
[1:43:00] instruction that's when they take their
[1:43:02] attitude I want to come here to save my
[1:43:04] God keep your God to your house
[1:43:07] worshiping in your in the room of your
[1:43:09] idol you can make it decent
[1:43:13] now so let's just close this thing up
[1:43:16] here
[1:43:17] but around says I still feel that they
[1:43:21] ought to hear the message the old
[1:43:23] they ought to have done it
[1:43:25] I don't have the feeling for the people
[1:43:28] that I should have until I can get the
[1:43:31] feeling of the people there is no need
[1:43:32] of me going
[1:43:34] because they be a hypocrite
[1:43:38] praise the Lord
[1:43:40] amen
[1:43:45] what around will talk to stories about
[1:43:47] God that wrote only believe all things
[1:43:49] are possible
[1:43:50] one time leaving his home after getting
[1:43:52] in in a little talk with his wife
[1:43:58] and he would kiss her going out
[1:44:01] he kept driving looking in the rear view
[1:44:03] mirror
[1:44:05] and seeing her standing
[1:44:08] and he turned around and came back and
[1:44:11] can't start again brother Brown says he
[1:44:13] says he said the second one had a
[1:44:15] feeling in it I did the first one
[1:44:17] because it was just something we do all
[1:44:19] the time
[1:44:23] but he he got repentance
[1:44:26] he turned around
[1:44:30] he came back and did it right
[1:44:39] let's just read this last one that we
[1:44:41] closed here pray that God will place in
[1:44:44] my heart
[1:44:45] that's something that I have lost out
[1:44:47] there in that complex
[1:44:50] it's so easy to build a complex
[1:44:54] this is so easy
[1:44:56] I had an interview the other day
[1:44:59] with my brother will sitting sitting
[1:45:03] here you see if if you really follow
[1:45:05] this story that's that was what make
[1:45:07] brother will die
[1:45:09] when he fell dead and brother Brown and
[1:45:11] prayed for him
[1:45:13] because he was on a complex
[1:45:21] praise the Lord
[1:45:24] he was sitting in the seventh brother
[1:45:26] Branham was preaching
[1:45:28] and he just allowed the spirit of
[1:45:30] complex to get him
[1:45:33] and he dropped dead
[1:45:35] his wife was a nurse
[1:45:37] she said his pulse is gone
[1:45:44] it's so easy to get a complex
[1:45:48] I had an interview the other day with
[1:45:50] brother well sitting here standing here
[1:45:52] in the front a good man
[1:45:55] but Bill himself a complex
[1:45:58] built himself around accomplice and not
[1:46:00] a kind of a complex
[1:46:02] did the same thing real well
[1:46:06] you can so easily do it
[1:46:11] it's you just
[1:46:13] just get a little something in your mind
[1:46:16] just a little something in your mind
[1:46:19] just a little something and many times
[1:46:23] that little something makes you to feel
[1:46:26] special
[1:46:30] just a little something in your mind
[1:46:37] why would it look at me like that why
[1:46:39] would it talk to me like that
[1:46:51] is you just get a little something in
[1:46:53] your mind keep thinking that way
[1:46:56] go back and check it with the scripture
[1:46:58] and see if it's right or not
[1:47:01] and then go from there on yeah don't
[1:47:04] lose feeling of the people see you must
[1:47:07] remember
[1:47:09] they are not made out of Sawdust
[1:47:14] they are flesh and blood
[1:47:16] human beings and the soul
[1:47:19] praise the Lord
[1:47:21] amen and that's some of the reason why
[1:47:25] you know why uh when a man is honored
[1:47:29] the anointing and he's preaching
[1:47:32] and the Holy Ghost is is dealing with us
[1:47:35] and and rebuking us you know that
[1:47:39] when a man is just fleshly
[1:47:42] and he wanted he want to now start
[1:47:44] attacking the people just to prove that
[1:47:48] uh uh uh you know me I don't compromise
[1:47:53] praise the Lord
[1:47:55] as long as the Lord will help us
[1:47:57] unless I don't feel that way
[1:48:00] I would rather I would rather be wrong
[1:48:02] I'd rather I would choose to be wrong
[1:48:06] than to find a man wrongly attacking the
[1:48:09] people of God
[1:48:14] praise the Lord
[1:48:17] I made out of Saul and does they are
[1:48:20] human they have souls
[1:48:23] and after we take our time to come to
[1:48:26] church
[1:48:29] with all the struggles in all the wars
[1:48:31] and everything
[1:48:33] we want the Holy Ghost to come and
[1:48:35] rebuke us we want the Holy Ghost to
[1:48:37] reprove us
[1:48:41] if he tells us we are wrong he must tell
[1:48:44] us what we need to do for us to get out
[1:48:46] of it
[1:48:57] praise the Lord
[1:48:59] oh there the people say I can't say Amen
[1:49:02] the people they are not even pray up the
[1:49:04] people are

[1:50:12] and being the pastor of this church
[1:50:15] we have gone and we are going through
[1:50:18] one of the difficult times
[1:50:21] this assembly has ever gone through
[1:50:24] I see things
[1:50:27] I see things
[1:50:31] and just giving it to the Lord
[1:50:34] well I believe in my heart I believe
[1:50:36] that we are at a junction we are turning
[1:50:39] a corner so I'm not discouraged praise
[1:50:41] the Lord I'm not discouraged by people
[1:50:43] attitude I'm not discouraged by people
[1:50:46] slothfulness and all of that no I know
[1:50:48] that we are turning economy but
[1:50:51] it's been a block of time we have gone
[1:50:54] through some of the difficult things
[1:50:57] that we have ever experienced as a
[1:51:00] church
[1:51:01] I mean there have been a time where we
[1:51:03] have four person in church that was not
[1:51:05] difficult
[1:51:07] praise the Lord
[1:51:08] I mean there have been times where there
[1:51:11] are uh uh you know I mean different

[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:25] but what I want us to do tonight like
[1:51:28] the Bible says let discern the body of
[1:51:31] the Lord when the Bible says discern the
[1:51:33] body of the Lord
[1:51:34] brother Branham says that's where we get
[1:51:36] to the place where we we think about one
[1:51:39] another we you take your mind off
[1:51:41] yourself and you think about the brother
[1:51:43] you think about a sister you think uh
[1:51:47] and even if there is one that you are
