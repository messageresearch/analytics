We want to remind you Saturday night will be the first and uh we will have forest farmer in uh uh preaching for us on Saturday night. Let's uh uh let's come and encourage the preacher. Let's come and and be blessed in his presence. Amen. And then uh Sunday morning uh don't forget to change your time. We will be uh changing our time.

And then next Wednesday we will have our brother Andre from Germany passing through. He will be speaking for us that's also planned to come and support the service. We might have a little bit of change out if uh if I told brother Lawrence if I can make it here on time I I would just lead the songs to sing one or two song and just give him the time to be able to to preach. you know uh when it's the first time among people you get neighbors you know so we want to give him enough time so he can be able to speak to us amen praise the lord so u uh it all depends if I can make it your own time amen so bless you and once again we want to say that we we're grateful that the Lord gave us a wonderful time I really enjoy the service on Sunday and uh uh enjoy the presence Like I said, just coming into this into the building, you know, Brother Brandon was closing that message, the church in his condition, you know, talking about the lamb, the dove coming on the lamb and and uh and he was in prayer and and it just created such an atmosphere uh that uh it kind of a blessed service. Amen. So, we thank the Lord for that. Revelation chapter 4, let's go back there. That was where we read on on Sunday and we just want to pick up and talk from there. Again, like I said, I'm I'm not a I'm not a teacher, but we're just we are just pick up picking up bit and pieces for us to be able to fellowship around. So, Revelation chapter 4, let's read from verse one. After this, after the church ages and uh after this I look and behold, a door was open in heaven. In Revelation chapter 3, the door was closed on earth. The church closed his door. God opened his door in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. After this, I look and behold, a door was open in heaven. And the first voice I which I heard was as it were, the voice of a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up, hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter. And immediately I was in the spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. And he that sat was told looked upon like a jasper, and sat in stone, and there was a rainbow around about the throne. So it was a fullness of a of of of a rainbow. Amen. It was a fullness. It was not half a board this time. It was a complete because it was round about round about the throne in the uh in sight like onto an emerald. And around about the throne were four and 20 seats. And uh upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white ramen and they had on their head crowns of gold. I was listening to revelation chapter 4 today brother Brandon said it cannot be angels because angels are not promised crown. Amen. So this have to be rewards of uh of of humans that he says it cannot be angels because angels were not promised crowns. And out of the throne proceed lightning and thunder uh and thundering and and voices and there were seven seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God. Back to the subject of the seven spirits. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we just want to thank you again that we have another opportunity to be in your house, Lord, to be in your presence tonight. Bless the effort of your children after a busy day, Lord. Father and uh the children going to school and and and Father Lord and and who make it together tonight, Lord. Father, especially Lord God, these these little ones that come Wednesday night and then uh Thursday, they have school. We want to just ask special blessing upon them. Father, Lord God, uh uh it will go before them for many days. Lord Jesus we pray that Lord you will bless your word now to our heart in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Going to speak a little bit tonight on the God of varieties. The God of varieties. Amen. But it's it's it's all part of uh the subject of the seven spirits that we we've been talking about. And uh uh I want to read uh Matthew chapter 19 verse 27. Matthew 19:27. Matthew 19:27. I had a prophet referring to that today and uh and it was uh I want to share that's when he's talking about uh crowns are not promised to angels. Matthew 19:27 the Bible says then answered Peter and said unto him Jesus behold we have forsaken all and follow thee what shall we have therefore praise the Lord do you feel like that sometimes &gt;&gt; amen praise the Lord &gt;&gt; that what is the benefit of this thing &gt;&gt; what is the benefit you know uh uh uh I mean We could we could we could dash into the pleasure of life and just have pleasure. And uh uh and yet uh uh it seems strange, you know. Uh sometimes I think about if God would just allow us and says, "Well, okay, today just for one day do whatever you want to do." I wonder what are some of the things that we would do. Praise the Lord. I wonder what are some of the things that we want to do that we would just do for that one thing. I pray that uh uh there be no desire in us to do wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even if the even if the opportunity was given, I pray that there is no desire in us &gt;&gt; to do wrong. Praise the Lord. Because after you come back to your senses, you're going to regret it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so uh uh behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee. What shall we have? Therefore, and Jesus said unto them, verily I say unto you, that ye which have follow me in the generation of the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory. Ye shall also sit upon 12 thrones. So, so you see there in Revelation chapter 4. Now the reason why I'm saying this is because uh in the seals when brother Brandham said John saw John he saw his his name on the book of life or he saw himself when the seals were open. It was not uh uh uh it was not sometimes it it sounds uh very uh uh mysterious to us. But you realize that uh uh brother Brandon never make up things. He never make up things as a prophet. He sent he was his his ministry was to help us to understand the word. Here is Jesus giving the disciples and John was part of these disciples and Jesus is telling them you people that have forsaken the synagogues, the Sanhindrance council and all to follow me. This is this will be your reward. I will give you 12 thrones. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh and he says here also shall sit upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And here is John now caught up in the spirit. And he seen that representation before before the throne. That was what brother Brandon was referring to when he said John saw John. &gt;&gt; Because your name in the book of life is not John Davis. It's not blotted one. That's not your name. It's is it's a revelation. It's a representation. So when that when that representation becomes so real to you, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then you can say my name is in the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say I saw my name in the book. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus here is giving John this promise that that or giving his disciple this promise uh and here shall sit upon 12 throne judging the 12 tribes of Israel and uh and everyone that have forsaken houses, brethren, sisters, father, mother, wives, children or land for my name's sake shall receive a hundfold and shall and shall inherit very everlasting life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So year uh uh over year now John is now getting a true understanding of the things that Jesus said to them while he was with them in in his earthly ministry. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So it is that understanding that that that that makes it real to John. And I think that's what brother Brandham was referring to when he said John saw his name on the book. Amen. Or John saw John because he's represented in the 12 in the 24s which is the 12 apostles and the 12 patriots. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, uh, I I just wanted to to bring that one also as we uh as we as we continue in in our our fellowship around um around the throne. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord as we continue in our fellowship around the throne. So, so uh uh tonight uh uh looking at this uh uh and and and and talking about the 12 spirits. I not 12 spirits, seven spirits. Uh I I thought that uh we should look at something a little bit here [clears throat] because uh uh uh God is one and his spirit is one. So we want to see the sense of this seven spirit. Why the Bible say the seven spirit of God? We want to look at it a little bit and uh and one of the the simplest way I think I can bring it tonight is to look at the God of varieties. Amen. For us to look at the God of varieties. So let's let's just uh let's just jump right in there. Now another thing here that we want to we we want to look at here is that and there was a rainbow around the throne. Now we know the first time uh the Bible would talk about a rainbow was what God gave to Noah. Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave him therefore a sign. &gt;&gt; The Bible says God gave him a board. So it was just like a board. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was the first one that handle bow and arrow. Amen. He was the first one that handle bow and arrow. So he gave Noah aboard in the heavens and of of of these of of this rainbow. And we know that the rainbow is made out of seven colors. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Seven colors. Now, so God is representing in the heavens uh uh and making a covenant with the earth that he's not going to destroy the earth like this anymore. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to destroy the earth and destroy the life of everybody on the earth. No. God will send judgment. He will send plague. We will be right here. Some people will die and some people will survive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Like uh like all of these uh flaws and things that is taking place, it takes some people life and yet some people stays right here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Which of course in the days of Noah when the flood came, it swept EVERY LIFE that was not in the ark. &gt;&gt; God say it's not going to happen again. No matter what amount of flaw that comes upon the earth, it will destroy life. But some people will survive. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he should have board in the heavens and uh and and and then he made a covenant with the earth that he's not going he's not going to just take the life of every everyone on the earth anymore in the flood. If he ever destroy the word and take the life of everyone, it's not going to be a flaw. Is going to be a fire. And when he and when he do that, uh uh when that happen, then he's just going to just, you know, make a new heaven and a new earth and start everything brand new. Close the page of sin and sickness and just get rid of this devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then just stay with heed and his and his subjects. Amen. &gt;&gt; He and his attributes. So that was the first time that God uh shoot rainbow in the heaven. Now brother Brandham said if we see yet in revelation that there was a rainbow that was around the throne it was a complete cycle. It was in a complete cycle. So if we look back to Genesis and see that there was a half of a rainbow. Brother Brandon make us to know that in that half of the rainbow, God also gave us a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That there is half of the story of redemption that is not told. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fullness is kept before the throne. There are a lot of things that we will never understand in this life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Some of the why does not have an answer. &gt;&gt; The answer will be given to you before the throne. &gt;&gt; It's before the throne that we have a complete rainbow. In this life, we will always have partial understanding. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We will always have partial understanding of things that we deal with and things and and why this is happening and why that is happening. We you will never get the complete understanding because almighty God has choose to keep it to himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will get to know it when you get on the other side. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, you will never be disappointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get on the other side and get to know the fullness of the you will say, "Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wish I knew that. I wouldn't have been frustrated as I was. Praise the Lord. You will not be disappointed. I promise you when you get to know the fullness of everything. So, brother Brandham says h it was also a sign when God shoot that that rainbow in the heavens. It was a sign to tell his redeeming children that their the part of the story of our redemption on this earth is kept to God alone. Amen. So we see around the throne there was a complete rainbow, a complete cycle, a rainbow. There was a rainbow round about the throne. Amen. So we want to look at that a little bit. And it was there for a sign. So that's what we want to look at tonight as we look at uh uh this uh uh god of varieties. I I title it tonight god of varieties. And uh let's let's read this first thing brother Ben Brand says here in Revelation chapter 6 as we start off with this whole thing. He says this great forerunner has gone before us making the way. He he become from spirit the great fountain of the rainbow of God who had no beginning or no end. He was forever through the seven perfect colors which is the seven spirit of God. Now that's what I want for us to look at this thought of the God of variety that this seven perfect colors the reason why the Bible is saying h God has seven spirits is is is shown out here in in in the book of revelation. It is the the seven spirit represent God's attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just think about it. On the day of Pentecost, it was the one Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; That came down on the day of Pentecost. But God broke it into 120. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says on the head of each of the 120 there was something little pillar of fire was hanging fire like tongue. It was just in a little shape. You see how the fire can be on on the candle just like a tongue was sitting on the head. So God broke himself out into 120. The Bible gave us a sense of that. One time Jethro advised Moses and said Moses look you're going to kill yourself. You are doing too much. You are having men among you. called those men that so they can take care of the you know the affairs of the people. So Moses gathered the men and the Bible says he and and the Bible will say it this way that uh the spirit of Moses came upon the people. It was not the spirit of Moses. It was a spirit of leadership. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God took that spirit of leadership that Moses had and he broke it among those men so they can be able to help Moses in the work of God. And I believe that's where Peter took that inspiration from in the book of Acts when he says choose men among you that will be able to take care of your affairs. Let them be men filled of the Holy Ghost. So it's the same thing. Praise the Lord. The same Holy Ghost that the preacher have is the same Holy Ghost that the deacon has. It's the same Holy Ghost that the musician have. The same Holy Ghost the brothers and sister have. It just that is a God of variety. &gt;&gt; It will not do the same work in every one of us. Everybody will have their unique place in the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the God of variety. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; The preacher preaching do not have a a a greater Holy Ghost than the people. You see that's the reason why you look sometime there in the prayer line. Brother Brandon was says that uh uh uh uh he he will say Satan the church of the living God come against you. Why is he saying that is because uh uh no one person has a 100% of faith. No, I might have two, you might have h five, another person will have three. Is when we bring our faith together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when WE BRING ALL OUR FAITH TOGETHER, WE WILL NEVER HAVE 100%. God will have to come and fill it up. &gt;&gt; He will have to come and complete it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even when WE BRING OUR FAITH TOGETHER AND IT'S JUST 5%. Let's wait on him. &gt;&gt; When he come in our maze, he will bring the 75%. And it becomes 100%. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he said where two or three I gather in my name, I will be there. &gt;&gt; So he he brings the completion. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's bring our little fire. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET'S START THE FIRE. AMEN. He will come and just bring the wind and just blaze everything up. &gt;&gt; That's how I felt on Sunday. Amen. &gt;&gt; I felt like he just came and just took up our little faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, he's the God of variety. He is our completion. We are complete in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are complete in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there's there just no competition in this sink. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no competition. The Bible talks about the measure of faith that we have the measure of grace. So it's by measurement. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But no one has complete. No, no. We need him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need him to come. So we see here that uh he's talking about this great fountain of the rainbow of God who had no beginning no end through the seven perfect colors which is the seven spirit of God which went from that great fountain or that great diamond. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That great diamond that Jesus spoke of, the great diamond was checked to reflect this color. God was made flesh and dwared among us that he might reflect his goodness and his mercy among us by gifts, signs, and wonders &gt;&gt; is God's goodness &gt;&gt; and mercy. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That God that was the great internal spirit that was dwelling by himself, he had to condense himself. He has to come down and break himself for us to really know him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is the reason why sometimes God take us through things. It looks like God is breaking us when we are going through things. But he's breaking himself &gt;&gt; and we are we are feeling the effect because the effect is to MAKE US TO KNOW him through the trials that we are going through. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just like when he came upon the mountain, the mountain shook. So if GOD COMES UPON YOU to reveal himself to you, you going to shake. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AND AND THAT SHAKING that you go through becomes like trial. It looks your body DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. YOUR MIND don't understand it. And then and sometimes it throw you in a place of sorrow. AND YOU FEEL LIKE WHY AM I GOING through this? But it's God revealing himself to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is God revealing himself to you? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, he's the he's he's just like that great diamond that was chipped to reflect these colors. God was made flesh among us that he might reflect his goodness and his mercy among us by gift signs and wonders. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's drop down. Let's take the one on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and see what he says here. Then he says u you see there is seven spirits of God just like the seven colors of the rainbow. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; These seven colors is all coming from one color. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seven spirit is coming from one spirit. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say God is spirits. [snorts] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so let's go a little bit here. There's the seven spirits of God just like the seven colors in the rainbow. And did you ever notice a three corner piece of glass reflects seven perfect color? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Benham is teaching us something here. You can you can you can take it. You can you can try it. He's telling you you can try it. Take take a glass. One glass that that has that has three three colors. I mean I mean three corners &gt;&gt; you look right in between it you will see a mixture of colors &gt;&gt; that is formed right in between you &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; is because of reflection &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; now so uh h a three corner piece of glass reflects seven perfect color. Did you ever try that? See see so you go and try it. see a three corner piece of glass yet it's only one piece of glass. It's one piece of glass but because it have three corners. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is it is the light that is that is pressing its way trying to find its way in the in in the midst of the three corner &gt;&gt; that is that is reflecting the light that is reflecting that seven colors is light that is trying to find its way through there. Praise the Lord. that you ever try set set a three corner piece of glass yet it's only one piece of glass but in three corner will reflect seven colors that's how father son and holy spirit being one yet reflect the seven spiritual attributes. Amen. So it is it is not uh it is not uh uh uh uh seven spirit uh seven you know uh individual spirits these are God's attributes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are God's attribute just like we read from uh Isaiah chapter 11 uh uh uh if if we just want to look there again. We read that was that on Sunday? I can remember. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh [clears throat] you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah chapter 11, we read that verse one. There shall come forth a rod out of the steam of Jesse, and the branch shall grow out of his roof. The spirit of the Lord, the spirit of the Lord coming down. Amen. That one spirit is going to break out into this. &gt;&gt; It's going to break out. The spirit of the Lord is going to be the spirit of wisdom. Is going to be the spirit of understanding. It's going to be the spirit of counsel and might. It's going to be the spirit of knowledge. And it's also going to be the spirit of what? The fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we see seven spirits right there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So is one spirit breaking itself out into seven colors. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Seven varieties [snorts] now. So uh uh if uh if uh if uh if our people there want to put out my first picture, if he ever made it true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So yeah, this is this is an example of it. So it's white light coming through there. Praise the Lord. I still have my point again. Amen. White light coming through three. So this this is a three corner glass. Okay. Three corner glass. There is one corner on this side. This is one corner. This is another corner. So a white light coming through forcing its way through here will always present three seven colors. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; SO IS GOD ALMIGHTY God condensing himself to come down and become man &gt;&gt; for us to be able to understand him. We cannot understand him in his greatness. He had to break himself &gt;&gt; and we will experience him through provision, through healing, through comfort, through strength. So he's breaking himself so we can be able to understand him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is the reason why we go through trials. So it's almost like u uh uh this this three corner represent you and myself. Soul, body, spirit. So when we experience the effect of God &gt;&gt; which is the puress of light &gt;&gt; when we experience him &gt;&gt; then it brings us into multiple experience. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We go through multiple trials. We go through multiple rejoicing. We go through different things. &gt;&gt; It's the God of variety. That is the way that God choose to express himself to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, so you will you will see here that trinity is devilish when you apply it to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, because he's one &gt;&gt; manifesting himself IN THREE. BUT GOD WORKS through trinity and THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE make us so body spirit. That's the reason why he become father, son, holy ghost. HE WORK IS A CHANNEL HE WORKS THROUGH. THAT IS THE WAY HE CAN EXPRESS HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; If he remain A SPIRIT GOD, WE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HIM. If he only remained a spirit god, &gt;&gt; we would have never understood him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO BE BORN. He had to express himself and come in our form. &gt;&gt; EVEN WITH THAT, WE WILL STILL NOT UNDERSTAND HIM. &gt;&gt; SO THEN HE HAD TO NOW COME AND DWELL IN US. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WE CAN LOOK BACK TO THE TIME HE WAS SPIRIT. WE CAN LOOK TO THE TIME he was flesh &gt;&gt; and we can now understand what he's doing in us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; IF YOU NEVER HAD NO EXAMPLE OF GOD BEING IN FLESH, YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S DOING IN YOU. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO THAT'S HOW THE SEVEN THAT'S THAT IS THE THOUGHT THAT is behind the seven spirit. It's the attribute of God is God making himself simple for us to understand. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's making himself He's making himself tangible. He's making himself visible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now give give us the next picture. So yeah there there we see again the seven colors it came through the threesided parameail and now is becoming the very thing that came through us is now becoming us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS PARAMED REPRESENT the church ages. It also represent the believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the church ages, we can say Ephesus uh uh seminar Philadelphia. We can go through the church ages. We can take the seven spirit and and represent it with each of the seven messengers. WE CAN ALSO TAKE IT BACK TO PETER and says uh ADD TO YOUR FAITH VIRTUE and to virtue knowledge &gt;&gt; that is to the individual. &gt;&gt; Am I confusing you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Am I going too fast? &gt;&gt; So we see the same light. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM CALL him the the the the fountain of God. that pure fountain of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take for example here. Let me give you another example as we go on here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; If I gave you another example, uh Jacob had a son, Joseph. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And for the love of Joseph, the love for this boy because of the love that he have for Richard. &gt;&gt; So when when Joseph was born, he treated him a little bit special. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and AND WITH THAT SPECIAL LOVE THAT HE HAD FOR JOSEPH, we see that the he he he got this inspiration and he was able to sow him a coat of many colors, &gt;&gt; which of course that coat of many colors turned out to be a sign of the rainbow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Jo Jacob was not thinking about God gave Noah a sign of the rainbow. Let me give uh uh Joseph uh uh seven colors. No, he was expressing his love to his son. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But now it's going to be a lesson for you and myself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? THE DAY THAT JOSEPH WILL COME out with this coat in the morning to show his brothers. Let me wear mine. It's not seven colors, but Amen. &gt;&gt; I I should have looked for the seven color preaching this. I never thought about it. But he came out showing his brothers and you know trying to show to them that very day will cause trouble for him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; THAT THING will will raise A SENSE OF JEALOUSY in his brothers. &gt;&gt; They didn't know what THEY WERE DOING. HE NEVER KNEW WHAT he was doing. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT an attribute of God, a thought of God was going to be expressed. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So just like I said, IS GOD TRYING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH YOU? Like brother Brandham said, in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. I never thought about that, but I will have I put that quote and read it to you tonight, but we know it. He says he says uh uh uh uh he says why are you going through these things? He said it is the father that is trying to express himself through you but you allow your husband, you allow your wife, you allow your children to handle it. So it's the SAME THING WHEN GOD IS EXPRESSING HIMSELF. You see that is the reason why Peter will tell us that if you don't go through trial then you are a bastard child. You are an illegitimate CHILD BECAUSE EVERY CHILD OF GOD GOES through one thing OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IT IS THE FATHER'S WILL that how God can make himself known to you. &gt;&gt; God don't make himself known to you intellectually. &gt;&gt; He make himself KNOWN TO YOU BY EXPERIENCE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; By the things you go through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then WHEN YOU COME OUT OF FAITH, YOU CAN SAY, I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVETH. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH MY SKIN WARM, MY BODY, BUT I KNOW I WILL SEE GOD NO MATTER WHAT I GO THROUGH &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT BECOMES SO REAL TO YOU. &gt;&gt; WHY OTHER PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT? BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING THROUGH IT. So God hate them. BUT YOU AT A CERTAIN PER AT A CERTAIN POINT OF TIME IT WILL BECOME SO REAL TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS THAT WHITE LIGHT PRESSING HIMSELF through your soul, body and spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Should I send you home now? &gt;&gt; Did you understand everything? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you understand it, then I don't need to preach again. You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's take another call here. Revelation chapter 7. [snorts] [clears throat] God is beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. It's beautiful. God is so good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God is so good. That's that's that's the reason why uh uh uh the scripture which says uh you know uh uh rejoice in your trial is hard for us to nobody really rejoice in their trial. &gt;&gt; Nobody really rejoice in your trial. The reason is because our human mind cannot process it that this is God goodness to us. &gt;&gt; The human mind can never process it. the human mind when it fell when Adam fell maybe he fell on his head. [laughter] Praise the Lord. I don't think he fell on his head. I don't know whether it was forward or backward but when he woke up his brain was not working well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN MAN FELL HE LOST SOMETHING. He lost something that it is so easy for him to think negative than positive. &gt;&gt; It's so easy. &gt;&gt; Negative thing just come so easy. We don't even we don't even try for it. It just comes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Revelation chapter 7. Let's take this one and then we can bring this to close tonight. See Abraham says here he says and in there we find out that he has seven varieties of spirit. I just changed my subject right in the office there when I when I was reading this. I was thinking how what should I name this tonight? Okay. The God of varieties. He says in there we find out that he has seven variety of spirit. Is that right? The Bible said in Revelation that there's seven spirit before the throne of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to our first image. The seven spirit before the throne of God. What it means that God from his throne expressing himself to mankind, he will have to come through a three h a he will come through a a a prison. Amen. a a a three-sided being whether he will come as father, son or holy ghost or he will be dealing with man that is soul, body and spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's the god of varieties. That's the reason why God God is not playing the racist game to make us different. He gave us different shades in the color of our skin, different heights, different weight. He's the God of variety. He enjoy it like that. &gt;&gt; And join God to enjoy the way he made you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's just the devil that is playing politics with our lives. &gt;&gt; So is God from his throne expressing himself, condescending Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. Tonight, let's go back to our our court here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And in there, we find out that HE HAS SEVEN VARIETY of spirit. Is that right? The Bible said in revelation that the seven spirit before the throne of God, the seven manifold, seven manifestation, seven expression. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Some some people uh h think that the seven spirit is just only subject to the seven messenger of the seven church ages. No, we we we we saw that in in brother Ben is something from the old testament. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh uh uh uh and just like I said, it was because the blood has not atone because there was not a perfect atunement. Without a perfect atonement, we can never had a perfect understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like Paul will say without Without the perfect atonement of the blood, we will have never have perfect understanding. So all of those things were back there in the Old Testament. But it took the perfect atonement of Jesus Christ blood to bring us a a clearer understanding. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because if you look you look you look at at the prism the first the first the first color is the color of red. Amen. That's the first color, the color of red representing redemption. Though your sin be as scarlet. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put put that our picture up back again. [clears throat] Amen. Now when brother Brandham in the brereech when he talks about the bleach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says the bleach if you put a bleach on all of these color it will break it down and send it back to white. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you put a bleach on all of these color, it will break them down and send them right back to white &gt;&gt; because that's where they came from. &gt;&gt; So in another sense, God is saying even though your sin be as scal praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; you will go back to white. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because white is your original color. White is your original expression. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That white means puress. That's what it means. It means puress. It does not mean your your white paint. That's why he says you from the the fountain of puress. He talks about love. He says he says the love of God he says what we what we have on earth and we are experiencing he said is so perverted is so diluted. He says the pure fountain of God when it came down it it started becoming corrupted that somebody out of lust will tell another person I love you when all they are doing they just lusting after the person praise the lord he says even the one we have for our children our wives and for one another he say it's still perverted because it's just failure you. One time we happy, another time we best we angry. &gt;&gt; It's not constant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's perverted. That's the reason why it's not constant. &gt;&gt; Are we together? I hope uh we can have time to just go through all of the colors, but not tonight. Maybe sometime in the future. Amen. But let's let let's let's just read. Let's go back to Hebrews 7 here. I want to close on this. I hope I hope something was to encourage you tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I hope something was there to encourage you tonight. &gt;&gt; The way that God is dealing with us is no sign of hatred. It's no sign of God want you to roll on the ground seven times. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. is if God is no sign of God want you to go on hunger strike so your problem can end no is God way of making you to understand him &gt;&gt; it's God way of making you to understand him that's the reason why when Job had all of those question he had all of those question because he knew by the grace of God he did what he knew was right to do he would not drag his integrity in the in in the mud because people are saying this or people are saying that when he did God had to come in flesh in a form of elwood &gt;&gt; to be able to help him to understand. Job these things were taught before the foundation of the word. &gt;&gt; It was taught. It was plain. God designed it for you. Praise the Lord. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So let's let's let's close this thing up here. And in there we find out that he has seven varieties of of spirit. Is that right? The Bible said said in in in Revelation that the seven spirit before the throne. Is that right? The seven manifold seven spirit. We find out there is seven colors. There is seven church ages. Seven is complete and God was complete in seven spirit. And those seven spirits were perfect. We find the first ones the color red perfect law redemption and how if we had time to uh to give those color will show each one of of those color represent God purity. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Represent God purity. Why? Because they they all came out of the pure fountain of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Our our our status in life does not make one one person superior and another person inferior. &gt;&gt; What what is happening is just our mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The color of our skin does not make one person superior and another person inferior. It's just our mind. To God is pure. That's the reason why David will express in a psalm and realize how wonderful and fearfully we are made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He say how wonderful and fearfully even even our oh man there there is there is something there is some there's no time tonight. It's 9:00 already. I I pray that I I will not lost it but I will find time to share that with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll find time to share that. Even even even the way that God make our temperament, he took his time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God was never in hurry to meet us. He took his time to be able to give us the temperament that we needed. to deal with the things that we will have to deal with. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same way you look at somebody and you admire THEM, I I JUST LIKE THE way that he's doing, that's the same way God will allow somebody look at you and admire you. I JUST LIKE THE way that she's doing. Seven is completed. God is completed in seven spirit. And those seven spirit were perfect. The first was the color red perfect law of redemption. And and how if we had time he says we can go through each of these color represent God's purity. Those color there are seven natural color. Those color represent the purity of God. Those color represent the motive of God, the attributes of God. God trying to help us to understand him. &gt;&gt; And the only way that he can do it is to touch you. Is to touch you. Is to come down and touch you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why sometimes when when the battle gets tough and it just looks like it's so tough and there sometimes it just it looks like there is no way you can see God in it. He's right there. David said, "Even if I made my bed in hell, behold, thou was there." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When the disciples were the the the boat was all twisting life and right and left and and and everything and they thought that it was a ghost coming to to swallow them. Jesus said it is I be not afraid. He said it is I be not afraid. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. That is the way that God can help us to understand him. The great internal one is piercing. The Bh said in Hebrew, the word of God is sharper than the two edges swore. &gt;&gt; Piercing the dividing the sun of our spirit and soul. So the word is going through all of those things. The marrows of our bone, our our tissue, our seniors, our our nerves and and everything. He's going through it just like that. pure light going through those that that that that uh h prism and then it it just it just reflects self light. That is the same way the great internal spirit is pressing through this body of yours. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To express himself &gt;&gt; to you. It looks like it's so hard, but when you get outside, he makes you seven colors to somebody. I just love this person. They are so kind. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they tell you, says, you know, I really appreciate you. And then you say to yourself, if you really know me, if you really know me, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, there there is just something about you And you sitting there, okay, what is about me? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You already your your your hand is on the trigger. Your gun is already automatic. You want to stop just just blasting everywhere. You are so peaceful. Okay. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then you telling in yourself you say the person I know what I'm going through know what I'm going through. But you see it is it is not your work. It is not your makeup. &gt;&gt; No is that pure fountain that is pressing through. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's he's expressing himself. Realize we are made for his pleasure. He can do with all whatever he please. Musicians come tonight. Let's just let's just bow our heads and give thanks to the Lord. Let's let let's sing this song out.
