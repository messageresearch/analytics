[0:00] amateur thank you that's it all right
[0:02] what Annie you're potentially have the
[0:08] earnest the waiting now when you get the
[0:12] dynamics you have been quickened from
[0:15] mortal to immortality
[0:16] it makes the whole body come subject to
[0:19] the word you make you attack just look
[0:22] different live different you just make a
[0:24] difference hollow quicken you all want
[0:30] dead in trespasses and are you happy
[0:33] quickened what not his spirit that
[0:35] raised up Jesus on Easter morning from
[0:38] it is in fifth twelve in your mortal
[0:39] body so on is our soul quickens bring I
[0:45] make this subject to the word now how
[0:49] can you claim to have that spirit and
[0:51] throw yourself away from the word
[0:53] quicken that's up now or it will quicken
[0:58] your mortal bodies to the word you can't
[1:01] run without it you lose butters you
[1:03] don't believe all of it you have poured
[1:05] gasoline part water you ain't going over
[1:07] you've got to take it one hundred
[1:10] percent gasoline
[1:12] if you don't chip back far you ain't got
[1:15] no power you going over but all when you
[1:23] take let it light up on that every word
[1:28] is true then notice how is it Chloe
[1:32] notice notice it's a fight a little a
[1:36] little seed laying in the crater
[1:37] now potentially you are resurrected
[1:42] you're resurrected when you receive the
[1:44] Holy Spirit in you you're resurrected
[1:47] right then your bodies potentially
[1:49] resurrected look at a little Steve plant
[1:52] in the ground it has to drink from his
[1:55] family the water that pours out and as
[1:58] the drink it pushes up towards him
[2:00] coming more like the lightness of the
[2:02] seeds that went into the ground see the
[2:05] church come that way they're just the
[2:07] case of saint patient that is only going
[2:08] now in the blossom see the Spirit of God
[2:12] comes to that yes
[2:13] the world has come to the Antichrist the
[2:15] same way and I brought them out in a
[2:16] great union of churches see the whole
[2:19] thing and the individual comes that way
[2:21] everything works on the same on same
[2:23] scale of God oh he is same yesterday
[2:27] today and forever
[2:29] notice all on your way growing to the
[2:32] fullness of the Resurrection led by the
[2:34] Spirit as a son if you in school
[2:38] that little plaintiff drinking from
[2:40] God's family just keep he can only drink
[2:43] from one thing you pour oil down on that
[2:45] little juicy one time kill it
[2:47] that's right you poor stagnated water so
[2:51] water taint no Goods contaminated it'll
[2:53] stunt the growth
[2:54] it won't bear proved that right but you
[2:58] pour real good soft green hey no
[3:03] man-made chemicals in it just let it
[3:06] come from the heavens above it watch
[3:08] that little freak there's no water I'll
[3:10] get all that like that green water you
[3:12] put chlorine stuff it like you gotta
[3:14] toast us up with and the first thing you
[3:16] know it kills the plant that's what's
[3:18] the matter today you try give him water
[3:20] from the denominational fountain and it
[3:23] stunts the growth but lame as a cobbler
[3:26] that dew drops of high all around me by
[3:31] day and by night Jesus the light of the
[3:33] world and your God will walk in the
[3:36] light that beautiful light comes where
[3:39] the dew drops of Mercy are brown dust I
[3:42] allow me take these man-made fountains
[3:45] away from you oh I know nothing but the
[3:48] blood of Jesus that's all the fountain
[3:50] and I want to know that's the word
[3:52] dwelling me Lord
[3:53] watered with our spirit no now if that
[3:57] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[3:59] grave dwells in you you potentially have
[4:01] life led by the spirit to quicken the
[4:04] word to you to believe it so little
[4:06] thank you pushing up as you grow know it
[4:09] at Pentecost
[4:10] their bodies were quickened to a new
[4:13] line look at a bunch a little coward I'm
[4:16] always
[4:18] I'm just warmed up feeling good oh no it
[4:25] they were coward notice but they had two
[4:29] mechanics him but they were all sitting
[4:32] back in there - oh I'm great I'm free to
[4:35] go out make a clean goes all all in
[4:37] great big bishops the same time they
[4:38] don't operate you then preach the things
[4:40] I'm free to make a claim freed ourselves
[4:42] only a rule I just can't do that to me
[4:44] but all of a sudden the dynamics yes so
[4:50] what did it do it always feel their
[4:53] spirit inside but it quickened their
[4:56] mechanics that bodies were quicker they
[5:02] were no more towers they went right out
[5:04] in the faces of people yes sir you know
[5:08] man up Judaism you did well in Jerusalem
[5:11] or before the dynamics come they were
[5:13] just mechanics game in the toilets let
[5:17] the speed on are you and harpy my words
[5:19] these are not drunk as you suppose this
[5:24] is that I'll sure what it is the
[5:26] scripture that and I always just you
[5:30] think that many teach this to that
[5:31] coming
[5:31] no this is that they were spoken over
[5:34] the Prophet Joel it will come to pass
[5:35] when I say shut up pour out my spirit or
[5:37] I'll break think the die manis come into
[5:40] the mechanics there was a freighter war
[5:42] some of yous people that are afraid it's
[5:45] come woman Eliza g4w man that's afraid
[5:51] your organization will throw you out
[5:53] when you're baptized your congregation
[5:54] of scriptural baptism you need to close
[5:58] yourself in the upper room to the
[5:59] dynamics come it made a difference they
[6:07] were changed people from now hit quicken
[6:10] him from an old life of being a coward
[6:13] true all echo a lot of the tribe of you
[6:17] absolutely faced order mail to cross
[6:20] this crucified upside down
[6:24] no more cars buzz death metal victory or
[6:28] NAT all the dynamics is in the mechanics
[6:31] yes sir
[6:32] they quickened their mortal body now
[6:34] listen here's another thing for truth
[6:36] it's so quickening in such a way so you
[6:40] know what they were lifted up in
[6:41] heavenly places and their mortal bodies
[6:43] were so quick until their language

[7:11] presence of God till they spoke in new
[7:13] tongue every language what a quickness
[7:17] if the spirit that raised up Jesus from
[7:20] the dead dwell you quicken your mortal
[7:27] bodies it'll make you do things you

[8:58] could you imagine it I'm old mortal body
[9:01] and I said well I don't know whether I
[9:05] can believe this or not oh if once they
[9:07] were so quick and so the bravery of the
[9:09] heart of the tribe of juda sell it you
[9:11] all that way be cheap oh that Eagle come

[9:49] then they were so quicker than that
[9:53] quickly power listen close now I'm
[9:56] trying to show you the quickly power
[9:58] wasn't only in their soul but it was all
[10:01] over them it's gone only the dynamics
[10:06] come in to quicken but it quickens and
[10:07] mechanics you see what I mean they were
[10:11] so quicken till the goons we get to
[10:13] speak another language they were so
[10:15] freaking by the power of the
[10:17] resurrection of Christ until they laid
[10:20] their hands
[10:22] they were so quick and with quickly
[10:24] power to wonder lay their hands upon the
[10:25] sick they go well quicken your mortal
[10:29] body that they were heal by laying all
[10:33] their hairs and the speed quicken their
[10:36] fellowships together with God tell the
[10:39] old so we're so quickened into the
[10:41] presence of God until one a person died
[10:43] and their soul eGolf
[10:45] it calling back to life that's right not
[10:56] only was decimated ceases that's organic
[11:05] quicken pushes the more of us they lay
[11:07] hands on the sick they recover they
[11:10] praise in experience the solvation call
[11:13] the dead back on that's right
[11:16] quicken their mortal body if it comes
[11:19] into you if it be so now you can say it
[11:23] soul but if it be solely sign follows it
[11:26] a quicken your mortal box it'll quickly
[11:29] how Norris quick them into the presence
[11:33] of God Wow
[11:34] it was a spirit of God that raised up
[11:36] Jesus from the grave in a spirit of God
[11:39] I'll give him that
[11:40] eternal life come from the Greek word
[11:41] and you look at this going which moves
[11:43] it through you and then quicken there
[11:47] even there my hello how can you say that
[11:53] that Spirit dwells in you know you've
[11:58] done everything that you thought was
[11:59] right here's your evidence where you got
[12:01] it on if the spirit that was in crisis
[12:07] in you it also quick add you to the word
[12:11] or he is the word in the contract
[12:15] quickens you away from the word then it
[12:17] isn't the Spirit of Christ what you done
[12:22] until that moves you in the word my
[12:25] sheep hear my voice and they shall live
[12:27] by every word every word I was total
[12:32] after the knee my old mother is gone now
[12:35] and she was a very odd woman and she's
[12:39] there
[12:39] no engine and she was off but in there
[12:43] she was a person who didn't dream but
[12:45] all things she only had four five dreams
[12:47] all her life but every time she dreamed
[12:49] a dream it was true she had a dream it
[12:53] was true I remember one time how first
[12:55] started preaching many years ago we live
[12:57] in up hill in the road right about
[12:59] preaching of the church she dreamed a
[13:03] dream that I was standing here by the
[13:05] side of a three steps and I was standing
[13:09] preaching to everybody that they must
[13:10] walk up these three steps before they
[13:14] hit the highway and on the highways a
[13:16] little pearly like white line going into
[13:20] thee the doors of heaven to the thirteen
[13:23] that pearl had been stretched out to the
[13:25] top of these steps if that ain't my
[13:27] message exactly today justification of
[13:29] sanctity and I would think that a person
[13:32] has to come
[13:34] Bobby three steps to be able to walk the
[13:36] highway and said that there was a lady
[13:39] come on now you know what kind of shoes
[13:41] people wore 35 years ago well as a lady
[13:44] come by have a great big pair of the
[13:45] underwear this funky-looking
[13:47] and she'd come by and awesome wingman
[13:50] sister you can't walk that highway then
[13:52] yeah I think you can't eat it and she
[13:55] said Christmas at all thinking is a man
[14:00] man don't be I'll show you I can be
[14:03] justified thank you fighting till what
[14:04] the Holy Ghost and still walking and she
[14:07] I just let her go could do more bad I
[14:08] couldn't stop her and she jumped up on
[14:10] the highway to the fact that sister say
[14:11] yeah told you she started running up and
[14:13] she you know what the Bible says in
[14:15] Isaiah chapter that it has outstretched
[14:18] neck they have treated picked over
[14:23] mincing as it has two extra rinsing as
[14:26] we go making it tinkling with their
[14:28] heels the daughters of Zion and the leg
[14:30] thing and she started up that highway
[14:33] just as hard as she could run and edge
[14:34] wallet roll got an errand here she
[14:36] started really missing I guess and off
[14:39] she went
[14:40] mother said the harvest screams I heard
[14:42] my well that woman falling into those
[14:44] flames and smoke going down down I get
[14:47] the doctor around 30
[14:49] she just obeyed everything but one word
[14:54] the everything but one word sure then it
[14:57] costs to women can be saved sanctified
[14:59] until what the Holy Ghost can then save
[15:03] and some mansion I live a bread alone
[15:06] but by every word they see and she fails
[15:10] it as I said see she went on all right
[15:13] but see she fail to listen come on what
[15:16] was ahead and he's wrote the gospel by
[15:20] the disciples fossils and doctrine of
[15:22] the apostles and prophets and so forth
[15:24] and they won't listen power discs
[15:28] Whitney power is going bringing the word
[15:30] the mine that was in Christ was in using
[15:34] I'm trying to show you that you when you
[15:39] raised what God raised Jesus from the
[15:42] dead he raised up you also and also
[15:46] quickens your life with him
[15:49] you are now quickly although bands you
[15:51] or butter attribute in his thoughts but
[15:54] God had saw all in him at the finish
[15:58] this when God looked down upon the body
[16:01] the spirit left into the garden get sent
[16:03] me he had to die man remember friends he
[16:05] didn't have to do that that was gone
[16:09] God an ordered that flesh which was
[16:12] human flesh and he didn't appear when at
[16:15] first God he's never died that got his
[16:17] head
[16:17] think he'll gone but he didn't have to
[16:20] do it but remember he went there when
[16:24] you think God had never separated the
[16:30] bride from the groom yet so when God
[16:35] looked down upon the body of crime he
[16:38] saw both male and female it was all
[16:41] ravine of that one body think they are
[16:45] worse same same word the same word spoke
[16:50] of the crew speak to the bride well how
[16:53] can the bride come and fail to manifest
[16:55] everything was promised Eddie and the
[16:57] groom come and he wouldn't be the belly
[17:00] but what he did everything even to
[17:01] proven it by raising himself up from the
[17:03] dead after it then don't accrue as a
[17:06] bride have to do the same thing have to
[17:08] be exactly what the word said she'd be
[17:10] in these nice things though she asked to
[17:12] return to malice aforethought GSB
[17:14] manifested by questions the days of
[17:16] Sodom not the world after he just
[17:17] exactly I could eat into these things up
[17:20] perfect identification of the world
[17:22] God made no answer for Francis I know
[17:25] I'm keeping you a long time 16 minutes
[17:27] just those inner but maybe I get super
[17:29] then but notice lookie here what a
[17:31] perfect thing it is I don't know what to
[17:33] see against me look notice it but God or
[17:37] saw the bride in the groom hallelujah
[17:44] see to save his wife like Adam he had to
[17:48] go with her Adam don't know what he was
[17:51] doing he didn't know what she was doing
[17:53] but Adam walked out with his wife see
[17:56] and Jesus took his wife's place and it
[18:01] came sin for her
[18:02] remember he became you he stirred your
[18:06] punishment that you might stand in his
[18:09] place he stood in your place that you
[18:12] might stand in his way
[18:13] what a love what a fellowship how can we
[18:17] do not how can we do anything but loving
[18:20] friends to stay on ours but let's move
[18:22] on right the Pentecostal experience
[18:27] today and the coming of the Holy Ghost
[18:30] in this place jesus promised it's like
[18:32] the abstract to a title see now you can
[18:37] get a title sure you can get a title to
[18:41] a place but that still don't state yours
[18:44] no sir
[18:45] somebody weighed that current it come in
[18:47] and put a claim but when you get an
[18:49] abstract that shows that everything is
[18:54] ever against it it struck off coming
[18:57] back from the foundation is that right
[18:59] and what a man has said that he believes
[19:02] the word and they when the Holy Spirit
[19:06] come it is the abstract to the title and
[19:09] that gives you permission when you have
[19:12] it attracted every bit of that brought
[19:14] you and everything call it blown the
[19:22] aspect when the Holy Ghost comes up all
[19:25] this tyranny the foundation of the world
[19:31] and put a name on the book of life but
[19:32] was born to a man and woman and subject
[19:35] to standing guilty of sin receives a
[19:40] deed so when the Holy Ghost comes it was
[19:43] the abstract
[19:45] everything against me one of my mother
[19:48] done it my father done it my grandmother
[19:50] don't like a little epilepsy child bring
[19:52] forth either so they come to you from
[19:54] the grandparents say F what if she fell
[19:55] down
[19:56] I hold the job out that but when the
[19:59] abstract has come it's knitted
[20:03] everything Christ from the dead I have a
[20:15] abstract deep that I'm sorry a funny
[20:19] with the attack of the Holy Ghost making
[20:21] that body of words it off just a
[20:24] separate like it did in the abstract all
[20:29] my sins are struck out all your sins
[20:32] your father of Jesus Christ and the Holy
[20:35] Ghost has come as an end
[20:37] back to the title deed that God give me
[20:41] by grace by horn ollie
[20:42] Oh what scared up don't worry sis beard
[20:47] on I'm he that was dead live again I'm
[20:51] alive forevermore as the keys of death
[20:53] and hell don't worry not enough even
[20:55] deputy Oh it beautiful let's go right
[20:59] quick now the abstract title the bet is
[21:03] felt everything against in a district
[21:07] alluri may act silly but I feel good oh
[21:13] dear realize what that means
[21:16] here realize what that he is brother
[21:18] there's nothing to take it away we met
[21:22] kind of a hoarder
[21:24] hey vent water what these I have now
[21:28] taste in on my beneficiary of his death
[21:32] barreling resume
[21:34] Tina come DS that I might become him now
[21:37] he became a sinner that I might become a
[21:39] ton hey man all the abstract DS or these
[21:45] signs shall follow them that believe the
[21:49] abstracting now quickly before does a
[21:52] team is born let us now notice quickly
[21:55] the quickening of the spirit and we're
[21:58] sure since time so she understands it
[22:00] down watch what this quickening power
[22:04] was by something as the Sun has raised
[22:07] up look done on them at Pentecost what I
[22:11] did today
[22:11] what bet quickening power did today
[22:15] state quickening now let's notice what
[22:19] it did Oh Stephen Stephen says full of
[22:23] quickening power on that right see he
[22:25] was for a quick me power
[22:27] it didn't make Emma scared he said you
[22:28] stiff takes uncircumcised the heart and
[22:30] ears you always resist the Holy Ghost
[22:32] like your father's did sorry you which
[22:35] order the prophets this joke for
[22:37] succumbing to the just one did your
[22:38] father stole oh don't come to him sure
[22:43] did for quickening power they said we'll
[22:45] get rid of that guy
[22:46] and when he died don't in in this horror
[22:50] head the stony beat against it like it
[22:52] look up I see the heavens open quickly
[22:56] power was working I see the heavens
[22:59] opening Jesus standing at the right hand
[23:01] of God that's what quickly power done
[23:04] for Steve Norris another fella had just
[23:08] quickly power his name is Philip he was
[23:11] so full of quick new priorities have a
[23:12] great big meeting Jennison era Devils
[23:14] has been cast out people's baptized the
[23:16] name of Jesus Christ his hand a real
[23:18] meeting and the spirit spoke to me Oh
[23:22] dynamics come down and said lead this
[23:26] revival but well the minister say
[23:28] make a difference he is full of
[23:31] quickening power he had the gasoline and
[23:34] the dynamic was falling upon him they go
[23:38] out into the desert and he found a
[23:41] eunuch there
