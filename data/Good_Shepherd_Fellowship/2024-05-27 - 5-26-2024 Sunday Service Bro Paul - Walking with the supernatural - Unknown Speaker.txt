night uh uh we go back many years uh uh originally from the Togo but uh uh he was uh in the Aros I think there's uh somewhere where he met the message between AR Co and Ghana and uh uh he living the city that was an hour from where I was but we didn't get to know one another during that time I think think he might have traveled out of the country before I moved there and then uh but he was always coming down for some of our International Convention he was one of The Interpreter that's that's where I got to know him first and uh uh he did some little work in interpretation or translation let me see it that way uh uh with with message there and some message material he works uh with Brother s over there in New York and all of there so it's been a while that we've been wanting to have brother Paul come and visit with us and uh uh just to reconnect uh and U we just fa that you will come this time so he was supposed to be here last week was actually last week Sunday he was supposed to preach for us but then there was uh uh there was a funeral of a dear brother they went to be with Lord another good friend also uh uh and and the family wanted him to be be there so so he had to go for that feral so then we had to push push uh it to this weekend so spoke for us on Wednesday night he will come and bring the word tonight praise the Lord and uh uh we pray for him he have a flight right after preaching praise the Lord so um uh we P all we can and if he can travel today we'll send him back tomorrow so uh uh let's just stand on our feet and and then we will we will turn the service over and we have made some few comment from the the Sunday School tap that we played this morning but I will save it for next week and uh um just to be able to address some few things from the tape and also that concern us uh brother BR was talking about M's meeting we should have hours coming up here in August where we need to sit down as brothers of the church and talk about things that that concern us here as a local assembly and uh uh because we want to have uh our anticipation is uh the furtherance of the kingdom of God the continuation of uh the Church of the Living God praise the Lord the church do not die when men's die amen men die God raised up men to continue the work of God so we want to keep that in our mind praise the Lord many of us have walked with the Lord different experiences with the Lord but uh there is a generation of young people that we need to set a foundation for it's a generation of young people that we need to pray that God get a hold of them because we don't have a future and we don't have a Young Generation that have grabbed the vision and I think those are some of the things that brother Brandon was bringing over that message that's some of the things we want to talk about praise the Lord but until that time we just prepared ourself now and uh and ask that the Lord will just come and speak to us speak to us in his own way let our brother have the Liberty to bring the word and uh uh and we will be grateful we can say like those men on the road of himay did not our heartburn within us as the word was spoken to us this morning praise the [Music] lording let's sing this song uh they were all in the upper chamber oh Lord send your power just now let's sing the what our brother come and bring the word there all with one when the Holy Ghost descended I a prise our Lord Oh Lord send your power just down oh send power just and oh oh s send your power just down and baptize every oh Lord oh oh Lord [Music] let's bow our heads for prayer blessed Eternal Heavenly Father we want to thank you this morning for this privilege giv to us to be in your presence we want to thank you Lord for how far thou has led us in this journey and we are trusting oh God that thou who are led us thus far will continue to lead us to our perfect destination we thank you Lord God for the word that is being done here we thank you for your servants we thank you Lord God for the offices the Deon trustees and the lady we are so grateful and thankful unto you and as we have gathered here this morning oh God we pray for your leadership we pray God that you take men out of of the way and come yourself heavenly father and take full control of everything Lord I confess Lord my incapacity I'm solely depending on you this morning that you yourself will come and take the word and plant it into the heart of your children Lord come this morning and lead us through God in in a spirit that do not confess your name oh God we pray oh father that you come down and drive them away we bless the blood of Jesus Christ between us and and them oh Lord come this morning Father speak to our hearts as we commit everything to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated we greet all of you this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is always good to be in the house of God for in his presence uh we have everything that you need In God's Presence we have Deliverance in his presence you have healing and anything that your heart desires so we believe this morning that uh if you have come with Desires in your heart God will be gracious to you and Grant your heart desire and as your pastor was saying uh he had wanted to come here many times but I believe this is the right time and as he was saying um I used to live in every Co called and then later I move back to Ghana and uh I Used to Be The Interpreter in many conventions you to travel with many of the ministry Breen brother team ason which you know him very well and some other ministers before I came here in 2003 with my wife who passed away for years years ago it's about 4 years and uh a month I believe and here we are this morning among you to bring forth the word I don't call myself a preacher but I believe uh God will lead it this morning to say some things that will be a blessing to you and what I want to say is this we are living in a very treacherous time times where we find many people uh who want to go their own way but God did not create us to go our own way he Likens us to a sheep and as a sheep you need a shepherd and it's always good to be under the leadership of a Shepherd the prophet of God has repeated that so many times stay with your pastor and if there is anything that you don't understand go on your knees and pray if you still don't understand go to the shepherd God has so much equipped him to be able to help help you in this journey now in these days uh many want to go their own way but that is not God's way God's way is for his children to be led by himself and he places a pastor in a local church to be able to guide you and it's always good to have confidence your pastor if God has been gracious to him and he has led you thus far continue to have that confidence that God will continue to help him to lead you to his perfect destination is very important it's so simple that many people walk over it and when they do that they have problem along the way and if you do not want to have a problem stay with your pastor and the message I have where with um my pastor brother Simon bring gretings to from him to you um he has always said that and I've seen a lot as we work together people always want to go their own way they will leave churches and then by the time you realize they they are in deep problems but it pays to stay with your pastor is very important and let's turn us we read the word of God thank you musicians let's open to the Book of John chapter 3 John chapter 3 we will read from verse one to verse 13 John chapter 3 pray for your pastor pray for the his family don't say any evil thing about them God expects you always to speak good of your pastor and about one another is very very important so let's read verse John chapter 3 reading from verse 1 to verse 13 I hope you are there there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto the the ye must be born again the wind bloweth with it listed and thou hearest the sound thereof but can not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirits Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be Jesus answered and said unto him are thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen that which we have sinen and ye receive not our test our witness if I have told you Earthly things and ye believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things and no man had ascended up to heaven by he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word amen you may be seated I want to thank brother W for the invitation it's been a nice time being with you uh I was staying with brother Dan and the family they fed me very well and I believe next time I can I'll still be there and also uh brother one we were there on Saturday no Friday and we had some wonderful food over there cooked by the wife with a nice heart pepper I really appreciate that so God bless you all uh greetings to brother Andrew and the wife over there Sister Christine God richly bless you now this morning we want to take in the next 45 50 minutes and speak about walking with the supernatural walking with the [Music] Supernatural last Wednesday we were speaking on building a spiritual house for the Living God and we know that God is Supernatural God is a spirit and he created man in his own image in his own likeness and the man that he created was a spirit man and later on he formed a body from the dust and pull that Spirit man in the formed man but the formed man was just the mechanics and the spirit man was a Dynamics so the mechanics was being led by the Dynamics now that Spirit man uh the Bible says was in a resemblance of God in other words the spirit man that God created was a portrait of God if we you say so so we see that as long as the man in the Garden of Eden i b with the word of God everything went fine for him now when they listen to Satan's voice then came the trouble and that is why we see today on the streets I mean you see you hear of the ambulance you see a lot of things it because of the fall of men and the prophet of God in the message that he preached in 1962 Wes he said as soon as the men Adam and Eve listen to the light of Satan the image of God left them the image of God was that Spirit man that was dwelling in them and the prophet says the very minute that they listen to Satan's lie the image of God took flight I want you to pay attention to that quote I I'm going to read it again the prophet of God says he says now when Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of the devil the holy image he calls it the holy image of God L them their Fellowship was broken with God their Fellowship of what Oneness with God was broken the very minute they listen to the LIE of the devil that brought their Fellowship that broke their fellowship and the very minute you listen to the LIE of the devil it to break your fellowship there is the very minute you go out from the presence of God wow when do you go out of the presence of God the very minute that you listen to Satan's lie that very minute you are out of the presence of God think about it and he continues to say this it says that is a very minute that you go out from the presence of God like he did is when you fail to take God's word just as it is God has given us his word in other words he has given us himself because the Bible say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God and the prophet somewhere said the word is still God so what we need to do is take the word of God and walk by it because that is the best thing God could ever give to human being is himself and the very moment you listen to any other things apart from the word of God apart from the voice of God you are out of the presence of God and when you are out of the presence of God you are at the mercy of the devil and that is why he behooves us to take God as at his word the best thing he could ever give to human being is himself is his word and the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve they were fortified behind this word in the same way today as long as we abide with the word and he abide in us we are fortified we are protected but when you come out of that word you leave that word and choose to walk by yourself you are by your own God is no more with you and that is what the prophet of God kept on saying stay with the word stay with the word and when you stay with the word you are fortified by it but when we leave the word of God then anything can happen to us now here was a man named Nicodemus that came to Jesus by night it doesn't matter when you come to him the important thing is that you come to him you see and when he came he has seen a lot of Miracles done by the Lord Jesus Christ and his other Pharisees they've seen the same thing and he said we know master that thou are from God that all these things that you do if God is not with you you cannot do them and Jesus start started talking to him and verse three he said Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you see being born again and last we were talking about the new birth and the prophet of God says when you are born again then you have faith you do not have faith until you are born again and the prophet of God says said there that when you are born again then you have faith then you are in a position to grow think about it is very serious that uh today people don't want to be born again they are satisfied with what uh uh uh uh intellectual gospel they are satisfying with Social Gospel but God goes beyond that God wants to give you the Holy Spirit more than you desire to to have it and that is why we have to stay with the word you see then Nicodemus God Jesus was talking to him verse four Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the the second time into his mother's womb and be born see this thing that the Lord was telling him went beyond his his head because he was not born again and for him to understand what the Lord was telling him he needed to be born again he needed to be transformed he needed a regeneration but without the Regeneration you cannot understand the will of God you cannot understand the purpose of God let me go a little bit forward in Matthew 16 there Jesus called the disciples who do men say that I the son of man am you are this you are this you are that and then he turned to Peter you Peter what do you say I am you are the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus turned to him and said thou are Peter by Jonas this thing that you say did not come by yourself it is my Father in Heaven that revealed this thing to you and Upon This Rock confession I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and if you read further down to verse 21 when Jesus was telling them that he was going to go to Jerusalem and there he will be caught by the the Pharisees the elders and be crucified and on the third day he had to resurrect Peter called Jesus aside Lord you are not going to die Peter was rebuking God because in his mind he couldn't understand what the Lord was saying yet he has been with him for almost three and a half years he has seen the thing that he did even It Was Written in the prophecies he turned to the Lord Lord no and Jesus tells him what get behind me Satan why he could not comprehend it because he was not born again and if he had been born again he would have been rejoicing even as kaii said it is good for one man to die for a nation think of it the same thing happened to us many times until we are born again then we can stand certain things you see the human mind cannot understand the will of God cannot understand the purpose of God and that is why the Lord said ye must be born again for you to be able to understand the kingdom then he continues to say Jesus answered verily very verse five I say unto thee except a man be born again be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom that which is of the flesh is flesh thus which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee ye must be born again that which is what is is flesh is flesh and the flesh cannot comprehend the things of God but the he that is born of spirit is Spirit it is the spirit that set is the things of God but the flesh cannot and that is why we must be born again it is a must it is imperative for everyone to be born again then you can understand the kingdom of God then you can enter the kingdom of God but today we want the shortcut but there is no shortcut to the kingdom of God you have to come the way God has provided other than that you cannot think of it now when you are born again as we saying the other time the prophet of God said when you are born again there is is a small light like this button that comes into your heart and that small light that is God because the Bible tells us God is light and the heart is the place that he has designated for himself to dwell in and any other thing that goes to dwell in the heart is a squatter because in the Garden of Eden Satan and God were taking his part their part of human the human body God chose the heart and Satan chose the head but the Bible tells us what that man shall do what shall live by faith and not by your sight Satan leads men through his sight what he hears what he sees what he feels but God goes beyond those things God leades by faith faith is a revelation and when you have faith then you can walk with God because God is the supernatural all that we see today is temporal but what we do not see is eternal Satan knows that in the message serpent seed brother Brenham was explaining something and he used the word Maha I don't know what we saw it last week last Wednesday m a h a h that is knowing the principles of Life say knows the principles of Light of Life he knows human being he studies human being you know he has been here more than 6,000 years and he studies us Satan studies you he studies me he knows what you like and it is through the things that you like that he will set a trap for you you see and God also God knows us more than Satan knows you you see and that is why he said man shall not live by what bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God so we were created to live by the word of God and to be led of himself think of that he that is of born of flesh is flesh but he that is of the spirit is Spirit and the spirit designs everything think of it so the man that is Born Again is ready to walk with the supernatural because this flesh only look at the outside things but there is an inner man the supernatural man we are called to walk by the supernatural not by the natural the natural will perish but the supernatural will dwell forever think of it walking with the Supernatural is very very important brother Bram me the message believe I brought it in the message looking onto the Unseen he says man looking at the uncen preach 1958 the prophet of God says this he says it is a strength thing that man who was made in the image and the likeness of God was called of him to walk by faith believing that God is and will choose to walk by sight instead of by faith that is a pathetic thing then he continued to say that after man was made after his makeup his being and all that dwells in him was fashioned in the likeness of God so as you are seated there you are fashion after the likeness of God now when man lost his position in the garden Jesus came to restore what Adam lost in the garden all the powers that we lost Christ came by the word to restore it back he didn't restore by any other thing but by the word then he continued to say this he said and God is that great Jehovah who calls those things which were not as though they were way and man made to live with God in this manner yet he has chosen to walk by his sight he wants to be his own boss God has created you in order to dwell in you that he will lead you that he will guide you but man has chosen to walk by his sight but God wants him to do what to walk by faith and that faith is a man is that Supernatural man the inner one that is in you and he wants to Lead You by that the man wants to be his own boss instead of letting the the the the higher boss the great boss to lead him but he's desire I want to go by myself but in the beginning it wasn't so think of that God created the Earth for his children for his sons and daughters that through his Spirit he will lead them I like to read the prophet and the prophet says yet he has chosen to walk by his sight he wants to be his own boss he wants no one to tell him what to do that is just the nature of man he proved to be thus in the Garden of Eden when he had lost his fellowship with God by chosing to go his own way not to have any one ruled over him sometime in a local church you see some people who don't want to be led anything that they will tell him they will tell them they want to go their own way and as they walk along move along when they face the obstacle then they come they will come back but why didn't you take instruction from the very beginning that is a problem of man that is the nature of man the Fallen man but if you want to be successful with God take him at his word if you want to go a long way with God start thinking right the prophet of God says what think right but that is your duty to yourself and act right that is your duty to God for you to be able to walk with God you need to start thinking right and act right for the Bible says what we should not be conformed to this present world but we should be what transformed by the renewing of our minds and when your mind is renewed then you know the will of God then you know what God is expecting of you but when your mind is not renewed you walk in darkness you walk in darkness until you are born again then you'll know that you are walking in the light it's a serious thing that today many people don't want to abide by the word because if you abide by the word you are saving yourself from trouble As Long as You Want To Be Your Own Boss you always find obstacles look at the prodal son when he got his share of his inheritance and went away sconed all that he had taken as inheritance and he found himself eating with pigs then he remembered when I used to be with my father things were different the very moment you think of going out of headship you can't yourself as dead the very moment the prodal son left the Father the headship of the father he was dead and when he realized that ah In My Father's House it wasn't it wasn't like that then the grace of God brought him back to the headship so it is for every Christian in every local church where you fail to be under the headship know that you are heading for trouble the pastor must not might not be educated he might not be rich but God has deposited something in him to be able to guide you to be able to lead you many times people are arrogant you tell them things I know what I'm doing and by the time you realize you find yourself in trouble you could have saved yourself from trouble by just listening I was going to read something from you you know brother Dam had a friend brother uh Dr Sam ad yeah been classmates and one time he wanted to acquire a certain property came to the prophet prophet was talking to him said uh go ahead get it and he said to the prophet i b i beli you all these years but for this prophet in fight in fact I find it difficult to believe you and brother Bram told him I don't know if I can get a quot he told him go ahead and get the property it's for you and I think I'll find yeah I may find it now he said go ahead and get it so you know the property owners were in Boston and uh the day before he came to the Prophet The Prophet said dock is for you go and get it and he was a little bit skeptical so the following day they call him and he got a prophecy and then he go he called brother branam he said I'm freezing why CU I've already bought a property when a prophet was telling him it was difficult for him to accept that because he was looking at circumstances around that property but he said I read something the other said when God says something is bound to happen where was God in that simple men think of that you might be doing something you will go to your pastor Pastor will give you advice and you fail to take the pastest advice and by the time you realize you are in a deep problem you go back to the pastor in shame and when he was giving you the advice he will not tell you that God has told me this maybe you have told him that he went to pray and he came back to you do this do that do that and if you are spiritual man you know that this man is a man of God but many of us fail many times to he to advice but as sheep we are called to do what to listen to pay heed to the advice of our pastor I'm not trying to to give flowers to your pastor but what is true we have to preach it not that he's here or he has invited me but what is true is true the prophet continued to say what I was reading in the the message look looking to Invisible the prophet continue to say that and man when he chooses as the day goes on go on we find man continually getting worse choosing rather to walk by sight down the stead of by Faith by the Unseen and when he does that he robs the inner man which is the soul and that is the Eternal part of man now when you want to walk by yourself the prophet is saying what you rob the the inner man but is there in a man that should be the true leader that is the part of God that is in you there is the Eternal part that is in you and remember things that you do not see are Eternal but those that you see are temporal the inner man which is the Supernatural is what we have to live by is the one that leads us because the god that brought you on Earth he knows everything and when he comes to dwell in you he knows where to lead you to walking by the supernatural you can cannot avoid that as children of God the Bible says what the footsteps of the righteous are ordained of God so the born again Christian always has that desire to do the will of God to please God and ask any Minister that come here to pray preach and preaches the truth there is something that pulsate in your in your heart just like the nurses when patients come to the hospital the first thing that they do they take their temperature and their pool and when the word of God is being preached there is a pulsation in your heart in your soul telling you this is the truth this is the truth and when you come out you always want to do the right thing you'll always desire to be led of him because the leading of the spirit never fails your sight can fail you your feeling can fail you but the inner man can never fail you walking with the supernatural the spiritual man in the Insight if you give him the right way he might lead you to a little mission somewhere where there is not many people but there is the spirit of the Living God for the outside men Fe on psychology intellectual but the Inside Man fits on the word of God now today all over the world people want mega churches they want big crowds and they despise little churches like this one but I'm not saying that God is not in those mega churches if he leads you fine they're fine you see but man God has created you that he himself will lead you now sometime people look at what how well the people are dressed the big building the stles and all those things but that is not always the thing if you are praying and looking for a church wait on God you know that to choose a church is like choosing a bride because the prophet of God tells us that before you get you choose your wife you have to pray pray a long time and God's at God's Own time he will lead you to the the sister that he wants you to marry so it is for a church churches have Spirit you must know that churches have spirits in the same when you are looking for a bride the prophet said what you must do a background check you must share the background of that family to know the kind of family that is because families have Spirits you go and marry somebody you cry all your life you cannot come out of it for marriage is what until death so it is for a church churches have spirits and you must pray for God to lead you to where to worship where your soul will be fed where your spirit will be at ease are you choose a church you have a lot of problem walking with the supernatural think of it he that is born of the flesh is flesh but he that is born of the spirit is Spirit your desire will always be to be led by the spirit and that is why the Lord was always telling the people it's not me that do where those works is my father in me is the supernatural in me the mechanics only has the the the Dynamics and that is so in this age the people failed to see the supernatural in the prophets think of that Peter and John one time they were going to the to Worship in the temple they have gone there many many times but this time as they were entering they saw that man at a g beautiful they have seen him many times but this day this time when they were going that man asked for money Peter and John stopped look at this and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you what was it the leading of the spirit they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and it's always good to wait on the Lord you don't hesitate to do things spiritual people sometime they wait and wait and wait until God talks speaks to them and they go and do what God tells them to do but this man he wants everything quick everything quick quick quick but the inner man he waits until the appropriate time God comes down speak to him and he follow the leadership of God think of it brother B was talking about young men and women one day he was driving somewhere going to church and then listening to some debates some young men were debating about something the most important things on earth and some young man was thinking about the girl with a the best curly hair and the girl was thinking of what a boy with the blue eyes but that is not the most most important thing the prophet said the most important thing is finding your God you see and that comes back to what praying before choosing your bride many time people choose by sight you see a beautiful sister or say this is the one you go go in for her after the first giving birth to two three children you look at oh this is not what I was looking for then your eyes will be looking somewhere you would have missed your goal you didn't pray before you entered in but if you have really prayed God would has given you what he want you to to marry you see today there are many divor even in the message why because the people did not take time to pray and wait upon the Lord and those you of you young men and young sister who have not yet married wait on the Lord pray and at God's Own time he will bring you the man that is fit for you you'll bring to you the woman that is fit for you it's very important but many times we neglect that many time when those things are preached it's so because you've already married you don't want us to marry but that is not the case the pastor only wants what is best for you when a man catch once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he is always present there is something that stabilizes his man uh the man's thinking it stabilizes his action in the time of distress and trouble it will still make him look upward and above all the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen and yet by promise so we want our soul to be stabilized we want our action to stabilize because you are looking on the Unseen because God has made promises and he watches over his promises to fulfill them as his own time if he says that you must be born again it is a promise and what you need to do take it to God lord you make this promise I need the Holy Spirit wait on him take him by his word and as God's appropriate time he will bring it to pass when he told the disciples wait in Jerusalem before Jesus go he told them I'm going to give you power from on high but what you need to do wait in Jerusalem and when they took Jesus at his word they were gathered in the upper room for nine days they were there and on the 10th day what happened he came like a rushing Mighty Wind to fulfill the promise that he gave to them God can never fail his promises but what we need to do take him at his word and wait upon him and when you wait upon Him He will surely visit you he called Abraham and gave him a promise the prophet of God said when God heard that voice Abraham heard that voice he took his backpack and followed that voice he followed the Supernatural and waited for 25 good years and as he was waiting people were laughing at him people were mocking at him as James or Timothy said I think James I know whom I have believed and that what I committed unto him is able to keep and Abraham was following the supernatural in spite of all the mockeries he was looking at the supernatural he didn't look at his body as being old but he look unto him that was invisible and believed the promise and at God's appointed time the promise sound came think of it our God is a pro keeping God he never fails but what you need to do you have to recognize that he is God and when you approach him in prayer you must know that he's God that he exists and that he never fails but one thing you know when you we are going before God the very moment you go on your knees start praying Satan will start bringing thoughts you'll bring this and this and that but Jesus was telling the people when you want to pray what you need to do go into your secret closets and shut the door and pray in the secrets and the prayer you do in the secret he reward you publicly but there is another closet that you have to to shut the door on that is your mind you got to know how to shut your mind to the devil and when you go on your knees and pray God is bound to answer you Satan he knows certain principles and that is why he will hinder you in certain things but you must also know him you must know his principles too is is very important and as I was saying think right that is your duty to yourself and act right that is your duty to God and when your minds mind is always positive when you go on your knes have that positive mind that God is a an answering I mean what do I say it's a prayer answering God be positive and go to him this is my trouble this is my desire this is what I want and be positive about it yes amen because the Inner Man create an atmosphere the inner man is a Creator and as you walk with him you walk in that atmosphere and it's the atmosphere that bring the results we don't without that creative atmosphere you cannot obtain results you are little Gods you are creators you can create that atmosphere and live in that atmosphere I think he perfect Faith the prophet of God was saying that Jesus was a Mystic to the people and if you're begotten of God those elements of God are in you you become a Creator and the inner man has potential yes as well as the outside man but the outside man potential only lasts till death but the inner man's potential is up to Eternity and that is why we have to dwell most on the inner man the inner man has immense potentials unmeasurable potentials and when you depend on the inner man you become a Mystic to the people think of it Nicodemus he had his share God was telling him yeah you are a master in Israel people look up to you and this thing that I'm telling you you do not understand you really need to be born again you see we can never overemphasize the new birth is very important but today we take it lightly God doesn't want us to take it lightly he want us to take it seriously the new birth now when we talk of Moses Moses made a choice in the me in the message by faith Moses barram was saying this I want to take the subject this morning Choosing by faith and I want to take for a test the first three words of the 23rd chapter by faith Moses Noel I think he took it from first or second John and said and Choosing by faith most everything that we do we have to choose by faith most everything that we do we have to choose by faith then he says and all that we find that Moses did that is worth repeating was by faith not by sight but by faith did you get it he says we find that Moses did all that he did that is worth repeating and we are repeating it again this morning that he did it by faith not by sight when Moses was in Egypt he was to be the next Pharaoh but there was a day he and Pharaoh they looked through the same window looking at the children of Israel working in the mouth but Pharaoh through his physical eyes he saw slaves he some mad doers but Moses looked through his by his heart and what did he see he see children of God and he chose to identify himself with what Pharaoh saw as slaves but to Moses they were not slaves they were Sons and Daughters of God and he chose to identify himself with them and suffer with them think of that Choosing by faith if you choose by faith you will walk by faith Moses chose by faith and that Faith led him to identify himself to those people think of it walking by faith walking by the supernatural it's not always easy but you need to be determined you know to have an anchor over there and if you have that anchor it will always hold any any time anywhere under any circumstance that anchor will hold think of it Daniel and his three other friends in Babylon they have taking the decision not to defile themselves by the things of Babylon the purpose in their hearts not to defile themselves by the things of Babylon there were many in Babylon but these four people the purpose in their hearts not to defile themselves and they went through things the position that they took they were Tried by that the decision that they took they were Tried by it think of Joseph the word that came to him tried him and he came out right you see now this man say that we believe we will be Tried by it and if you know your God that the god that brought this message and everybody everyone that believes it he will stand by him that will be your defense you know that God have made the promise he said I'll not leave you nor forsake you I will be with you even in you if you go through fire he's in fire with you if you have that Consciousness you know that he is with you that will be your anchor that will be your rest because he made a promise he will never turn his back to you walking by faith Prophet said he said and the reason that I have selected said this this morning for the church in this state has been that in our even our schools and around we've had we've had uh so much of science scientific teachings because of this we have drawn the people away from Faith now Faith is not proved by science faith is what science doesn't see if we ever lose this great faith then we are totally in darkness no matter how well we are educated how we could explain the word of God to Su our own way of believing there is no way to ever please God Only By Faith the scripture plainly states that that way and is by faith and without faith says the Scripture it is impossible to please God now we are in the same situation yes look at how sound science is advancing and drawing people away from Faith but God want say to do what to walk by faith look at achievement of science today many things are happening the drones the cell phones somebody can be here and Target somebody in Iran and kill him on a spot think of that but God was his children not to depend on signs but to depend on him to walk by faith and to live by faith think of that today when people don't have money they easily fall on their credit cards no more going on the needs to pray do you get me but whatever need that we have the first thing that we have to do is to go on our needs the credit is going to fail some some day money is going to fail someday it did fail one day in Egypt and it's going to fail again it's been prophesied P children and Daughters of God what we need to do go on our knees make our requests and supplication be our request be known by supplication that is what God expect from you because God has resources unseen resources and by faith we can tap into that resource think of it walking with the supernatural God wants her to walk with him he told Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect and Abraham did that he told him of a city and Abraham by faith will go here and there he didn't go by sight but he went by the inner man searching for that City you see brother in a message said today I can see him rejoicing in that City and all he seed will also do the same children of God walk by faith live by faith that is the way God wants you to live is very important our makeup is different the prophet continues to say now if we lose Faith then we will never get a prayer answered by God if I lose faith if you lose Faith your prayer will never be answered by God and he said for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him so if we lose faith our prayers are aned we get nowhere and there is a way we have to keep our faith because the Inner Man Fe on something the Inner Man Fe on the word of God if you don't feed on the word of God the Inner Man becomes weak the more you feel this man the more stronger he will be and the weaker the inner man but we need to Fe the inner man more than we Fe the outside man but we feed this one more than the inner one but we are called to feed more the inner men than the outside men you remember the two dogs the White and the black dog but Bram was talking with an Indian man and said Chief how is how are things going say all right and then he started talking about two dogs and then which one gets stronger he said the one you feed more get stronger if you feel the black dog more he will re over you and you you he feel feel the what the white one he will be the one that Reigns but he said it's not the size of the dog but the size of the fight in the dog that matters and if you feed the inner man more he becomes stronger when you go to prayer meeting you hear people praying or when they call somebody here to come and pray the way he prays you will know which dog he fit it's true if a person read the scriptures and pray you see that he's praying will be CAU in the scriptures which dog are you feeding which one are you feeding the one you feed more controls you and God want to be in a throne room on a control tower when he's on the control tower you know that everything is under control because we have another Tower in heaven and when he send signals the control tower in you receive that signal you see this cell phone that we have today they depend on signals Towers now you get to a place your outside coverage and it's difficult for your cell phone to be able to to receive it will be difficult for you to receive calls but when you're in a coverage area it's easy for you to receive calls in the spiritual is the same yes God wants us always to be in the coverage area under the blood then when he speaks from Glory the inner man can catch it but when you are outside the blood he'll be trying to reach you to talk to you you'll never get it and that is why we must constantly be connected the in faith connect to God but doubt disconnect you think of it the prophet of God said when you are born again you become a twofold creature the ome men to die and the inner man to live eternally and when you are born again you are a candidate of associate to associate with angels yes he dispatches an angel to always to be with you yes and somewhere he said when you are born again and that man is in you you become an angel and what is an angel a messenger a carrier of a message and when you are so much in tune with God God will send message go and tell this brother this go and tell that sister this because you are so much in tune with him you are so much connected with him and he has confidence in you he send message go to this s sister and tell her this go to that brother and tell him this that is what God wants us to be a messenger an ambassador and when you are an ambassador of God like this country sent an ambassador to Germany the whole brother us is behind that Ambassador in the same way when you become an angel of God a messenger of God an ambassador of God the whole Heaven is behind you walking with the supernatural that is what God wants of us today he wants to walk with us that we are Desiring to walk with him think of it God is God let me read some few things I don't know what time it is the prophet of God says man is always trying to achieve something by his head he supposed to achieve but by his heart that is the control tower where God controls him and direct his thoughts direct his Works direct his emotions sometime I get so happy I just have to let it lose and if I look around and see somebody then see I got my eyes on people then but God help me to keep my eyes closed I want to just be led by the spirit of God that the flesh will have nothing to do unto it think of it maybe you are alone worshiping God singing worshiping him then somebody appears then you open your up started looking at the person and then you become shy that is not the way God wants it whether there is somebody or not he wants you to Fellowship he wants you to worship yes just like we come to church somebody starts singing worshiping in the spirit no matter who is around God wants you to worship and sing irrespective for who is around you or not that is how he wants our worship to be you don't care who is around you all your mind is on him that is how he wants to worship Him and when he will worship like that then our worship is received but when you come to church they singing no that is not worship God wants you to worship with everything that is in you with your strength and everything maybe you live you live home a little bit down and when you come to the house of God as you go through that door something if you really want to watch something Supernatural will happen to you you'll be energized yes and when you start worshiping God will be energizing your soul and you worship as you have never done before that is the way he wants you to worship he wants your worship he wants my worship you see but the this man is a lazy man this man loves pleasure and when this man come under the control of the inner man then El limited is what he can do because the inner man will be controlling everything will bring it under subjection and sometime coming to church become difficult but you have to drag this man to church you have to drag him to church but when you fall to the dictate of this man you cannot come to church but God wants to lead you God wants this man to surrender completely then your worship will be accepted the prophet said usually ministers when they get onto the pulpit they begin to think if I speak on a certain certain thing here is a certain member of my church that is a good paying in this church they will leave the church if I don't if I preach that say that thing and when you go looking at the flesh again then God cannot lead that minister you got to say what the spirit says to say then we are led by the spirit of God you see so many time you come to the puppets and God is pressing on your heart to say something oh if I say this brother oh if I say this sister they might leave the church they can leave if they leave God will bring somebody but God has a purose for you to say that thing if you don't say the prophet said that God cannot lead you God has called you to preach the gospel and he impresses something on you to say and if you say that thing maybe a member is going through something and he want you to say it and when you say it then your heart will be discharged walking with the supernatural now if God can come on the control tower said my sheep hear my voice well now all these strange voices in the world of this social gospel that just belong to church and that is all that is necessary why hasn't he done something is done nothing by confuse the people what we need tonight is a unified Church filled with the Holy Ghost and power from on high led by the spirit of the Living God on the control tower that W say because I'm a Baptist and he's a Methodist and I have nothing to do with him a real true spirit of God who recognize his brother or sister I don't care what kind of brand he is wearing oh we need a leadership again of the Holy Spirit walking after the Unseen the way that God listes the things that we see are temporal the things that we do not see are Eternal we need a unified mind as a church United together binded together and when we are unified in spirit unified in Soul then God can move but when we have the divided Minds it will be difficult for God to operate for the Holy Ghost to be able to come down that day they were all unified in thoughts unified in hearts in one atmosphere and when God saw that he poured down a spirit that is what God want to see among us we come with one mind one Accord unified with one desire then God will come down and fulfill feel our grant our desires but when we have divided opinion he cannot move think of that thank you okay I watch my time maybe I'll have to say something you know brother bam was PR the message speak to this mountain prach 1959 and Sam Jose at the end of that service he was saying something talking about being taken into custody now when you take somebody into custody you take full charge of the person you take responsibility of that person it's just like sometime divorce people they have to go to court and seek for who should take this son or I mean this child into custody and brother Bram was praying and say Lord take me into your custody I think that is what we need today for God to take us into his custody and he was praying and saying this thing he said I wish I could find that Salon brought it he said Lord take me into your power take me into your custody I said this is a time of consecration this is a time of dedication take this church into your custody yeah here it is he was praying he said the Lord is in the midst of his people do you believe it let us all rise to our feet this is the hour of divine consecration if you can believe the Lord God requires a consecration he cannot break forth upon us until we have being so surrendered to his will to his power he cannot break forth until we have our hearts so cleansed from sin and things of the world until the Holy Ghost can ride in Us in upon us and surrend us now as he has me surrendered how do I know these things it's not me it's him that is speaking I have told you the truth about him there is breaking forth something new watch and see is already happening it will
