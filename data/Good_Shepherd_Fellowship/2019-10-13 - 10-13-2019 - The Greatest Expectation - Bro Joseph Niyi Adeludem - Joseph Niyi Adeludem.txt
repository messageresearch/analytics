little Bay then we will be going to the preaching of the word this morning but once again is good to have each and every one of you with us praise the Lord and I just saw brother Ibaka he's a friend to brother Daniel over in Chris ministry and had a privilege to talk to him on the phone his good reporter face to the name who will have you with us and the ones that you came with this morning praise the Lord Amen but it's good to be in the house of the Lord brother Aaron is now on a drum because he's over in Wisconsin he took brother Elijah to preach there for Birju he asked away but Samuel I preached for us all to get from Uganda on Wednesday it is over in North Dakota praise the Lord you know I just I just thought about it this weekend having all of these brothers with us I just thought you know I don't know what we are doing but it looks like God is beginning to trust us amen amen and whatever it is may he help us to do the right praise the Lord amen and the Lord also trusted us with the situation of sister Kish and and we believe in God she will I told her this morning that's the scripture that came to my mind there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ they have passed from death unto life so I told us if you have if you have been in Christ and you have already passed your death amen and I'm looking forward to see you coming alive but she went to the hospital and started getting numbness in her right forth and then the right foot went completely numb I would say completely dead and and she was not getting no sense of feeling in it until that night Rolly larger I myself went to visit her and then she told me you know she just prayed and before that evening she started feeling some sensation in her leg so and but then then the following day she could now walk on it so she's done she was giving therapy and they did s trade another thing at first they said nothing wrong but this morning she called me that it says she had fractured something in her knee and so that's the reason why she having pains even me she said well brother one I walk to the hospital you know I was walking on my fault so I told her this morning I said I said look forget about that knee what is happening here is dead because what is happening Church is the other sister Kish there's a major part of her organ that is that is honor attacked by the devil she's losing her liver so when a major part of your organ is affected the rest of your organ starts to become affected that's what the devil does amen if he can so one seed of doubt in you he will ruin your mind with fear with horror praise the Lord amen if he can expose you to any form of uncleanness he will drive your body to do the same that's the reason why young people stayed away from the things that are now right that just the devil all he needs to do is to just drop one thing into your system so I told her this morning I said what is happening to use is the cage it is there because of your health different part of your bodies will start becoming affected so because she says she said she's a better one pray for me and I want to walk again I said I don't want to want to see you walking again I want to see you living again praise the Lord I want to don't want to see you walking I want to see you living again praise the Lord but just like I said on Wednesday night you know every time we come and testified about sister quiche then the devil tried to make it worse and every time he's making the worse it's getting better every time he make it worse is getting better praise the Lord I've never seen the Lord forsaking the righteous amen the Lord never forsake the Ranchers praise the Lord we believe that that's the reason why we serve God in righteousness you can save the Lord in deception the Bible say be not deceived God is not mocked whatever a man so that's what he will reap but when you save God in righteousness he never forsake the righteous are we together so she wanted me to greet you this morning and she asks that we pray for her so we would do that and then we would call pastor Neal pastor Neal is to be very particular he's brought a dill his father brother Deli is his first son and the second brother family was here he preached for us and but he's he's also a dear to me because I remember when we lost our church and and then we went over to night I had an open door to Nigeria when I went to Nigeria there that church was the first church I went to so it became a home church there for me they were the one that was running all of my programs and making meetings for me and sponsoring my trip and I was reporting to him as my pastor praise the Lord and I remember one time he wanted you just wanted to spend some time with me so he acts that we drive we went about some kilometres down in in the country there's another brother there but Simon Peter and I was going to have meetings there but he just wanted us to spend some time together and we were just conversing driving he was he was the driver and now he's 73 years old praise the Lord amen but you know just like I've always said I look to see the resurrection of the Dead amen praise the Lord and that's the reason why I'm not committing cystic Easter to death but I told her husband and I said if anything happened before the rojo to the mortuary give me a call that just how strong my faith is I don't care what you are thinking and what you are feeling but that just how strong my faith is praise the Lord but like I said I'm looking to see the resurrection of the dead so Bernie will preach to us this morning now like a young man because he's not a young man but he would talk to us you know better Branham says when John returned back from the island of Patmos and he went to the efficient Church the book our first John and second John and ter John was written when John came back from the island of Patmos so he started to talk to the church like his children he said my little children walk in the light as he is in the light praise the Lord and that's how pastor Niels preached so he's coming to talk to us as his children in the faith and I gotta go back and tell you some of the things of of his life praise the Lord he was a pastor of a Baptist Church and a respected minister in the South in Baptist group and all of the adding when he saw the message he he turned over the the Baptist credential he came back to his local church and he introduced the message those that wanted to go with the Baptist system left and and then he started from there so he's been around a long time praise the Lord he's he's highly respected in Nigeria so we were having calm but let's bow our heads in our hearts this morning why we will remember sister quiche and turn your eyes oh [Music] Jesus [Music] in his warm the full face and the pain is up way grow strange Bibi in the line of his glue read and it's one of Jesus we want to see this morning let's turn our eyes Oh yester yeah

faith we bring them in a measure that we have this morning father God to remember our sister Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray to God fire the law with all that is within us this morning believing that God you will raise her up from that day but Lord Jesus you father God Lord the creator of the universe the giver of life and the giver of every good gift we pray the Lord you give her the gift of healing this morning father may you touch of her legs and touch her kneecap of God Almighty God Father yes of people Lord God honor expectation just like the scripture says the

you thinking about going back coming back to the house to see you and he said oh no I'm not at the house I'm at the office I told him I said oh my goodness I suppose sky you are a different kind and then as I drove right into the parking lot this morning I could hear the singing from outside and I said his brother Scott leading songs prays alone butterscotch just had surgery on his eyes Wednesday night people will make excuses for everything and anything now to come to church but it scatters over sixty years old being leading sons for more than forty years before even some of us were born and for as long as I know I've been in this church attaining supporting pastoring unless he has to travel [Music] seeing the man that is of his age being serving the Lord before me I just have to study to find something to preach even if I don't want to preach because I know you will be in church praise the Lord amen and like I always mention of our brother Wesley and his wife driving two hours from brainer to come to church here to Minneapolis [Music] and then we young people young people we think we so smart we have everything calculated we have people of example sometimes you don't need scripture you just need to see somebody doing something right for it to encourage you to do the same because before this Bible before this Bible was written to be a book it was once at tot and God took his thought and he expressed it in the heavens job never had a Bible no one ever had a Bible but they had the heavens that it could look to and they could see that there was the God and God sent prophets and stripes and the wrote this book and give it to our we treated in a way our formal status to be becoming better than the Bible that's a shame if you treat your Bible that way praise the Lord my brother told me one time he was trying to read from his phone and because the phone freezes something from from from and from from another book was right in the Book of Luke he says well I never read this in the Book of Luke before that's how technology will tell you wash out it can never take the place of God sacré Bible well let me tell you this word in this book it's coming out of

and he men I woke up this morning I didn't hire down I knew [Music] let's sing that again I woke up this morning oh yes I didn't tired of that oh I believe that the law will break me so I got down on

a but you give you a pregnancy begin to play clip to that pregnancy what one time him or hard to be begin to talk it that's what it would be you say passed or I'm saying in a one time we know now when John baptized receive really goes where I was where I was he charged joined Baptist we had a series of religious if we chose to do evil right now our own children God with the moon praise the Lord so what are we are stretching the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord is the great testing that any man where I'd like Christian like northeastern tambien 30 why he wore some many things the coming of the Lord holding this word the coming of the Lord holding our rapture so many thing that will but even we have gone on the route you cannot going a time you drive you pack I'm telling you we are so loved by God more than anything it's not what I'm telling you stand vibratory message the Bible says Esau I hate the cob I love wherever they because your prayer don't work II love my brother where are their sisters instead whom who created each of them who put them here and today I am Telling You on the earth anyone I believe Malachi for is the love of God it is it is you that God love that I cannot hate him and when God took take blah blah blah what guru he said God said look at heaven a light possible I will tell for you for you and for those who love you think of 90 minutes even if you are I'm telling you today your own story and your own life a lot of good things if you don't have it doesn't make anything and whatever I will resolve this world today a little you happy I forget about you too we have top building others who is just making nothing nor a stone put on wrong with Vidya whoever said don't forget switch off hop pump and fulfillment the first one everyone of us have read about Solomon's Temple a verdict by the good of God I was in Israel about two or three times then we asked one of those senior rabbi the acid well shall we say forget about telling Solomon temple seven many times I will destroy not because God says who is able so north stone route onward I will mean one of these days and for which that will will be destroyed because of me and you although stream would be destroyed will be renovated then God will build a better one for you and for me hotman hotman I was a root to be think it a minute we are not just God is not just breaking those to come in new you must come are you most the year to display him that white boy who says great Tati will you do I'm God through these prophets who knows what is greater pain many teens this what I will be praying for the sick song we are you will be free for sitting your workshop yeah something will taking place before me that is it Prince the Lord the greatest thing we are threatened is the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord cause so many thing for us and we might be sure that we are ready for him and we are the one holding is coming let me tell you this one to you know it can never lose any of us and not we have complete you will not come here problem said we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I was it God does not change and we believe that whatever is that is t2d it's not real it's not for it's only changing is metaphors or try our attribute or the way you want to use the same that that came I met Abraham I said by the time of my life and come to meet you and you who decide the child you have been waiting for for 25 years is the same that come again today in our own day the love of William Branham Graham said I am packing the minister of mercies Elijah and Jesus Christ together whose ministry yonder think in an award anything you have seen that it is also given to you today press the Lord Jesus don't you like to tap it go that doesn't change whatever I have read about him yeah and in the message is even today this morning or this afternoon you call them on the scene if we do the same thing so why I say that is the greatest exploitation well I say if calm where we'll be if he does not come then we are all liars and Paul was telling us he said if you have no the source of death then our what we thank God is nothing because God says so that is the backbone of every Tuesday when you stand on something that God said is not your world God always back up his word God prove his word if we say I will raise a church without spot without wrinkle it doesn't need anybody support he says who we reach god bless you I said god bless you a bus don't worry as we said this thing he may loop to the people of the world they

believer that I don't bother us to Co so many I have too many here but I've just read a little few problem with the message the second coming of the Lord say please note God does not change God can not grow in wisdom I want to say at will vary with me witness with your Amen if I'm telling you the truth see and if you want to go through it you can just get fifty nine through five through eight the expectation said God does not change God cannot grow in wisdom the first was that eases most witty last was also you and I and and II in our awareness each generation get just a little wiser as our telling us than the previous generation because it is taught in the word of God that we should be weaker and wiser that is what is happening a lot of us now if I say okay let us stretch a little elect like 10 with us everybody say no why we can but at some of we have come from we can track in my it doesn't stop us god help us because of the each we are getting weaker and getting wiser that's right you can say well - boy now when they take our smash pool now what you don't do indeed they have no need we got help us god help us and the Bible said it before the science will increase so when if one bring it is that if all those things that he said is fulfilling why will not come why do you have just not sure why we're not sure of the wedding feast praise the Lord and as I told you the coming of the Lord who's the destruction of this world Bible say when you come yeah it will be only to section in the world you want you believe us and others let me put that we believe us and others that's why I say don't perceive God really since like criminal orders but once it were the orders seen us I'm oblivious ain't I will send you during the calyx Tom somebody will die before they go to purgatory discipline people collecting money from them they think that it was instead forget about that you are doing listen here if you I said now you'll be seen forever you cannot nobody will die Cena and this obviously isn't the weight realized so asleep oh that is group my brother Alleluia does Alateen pop apart I remember very well 99 the previous poo before this one the third one John Paul Paul was I think you some photographs Restless some book the trust was in television that I'm one of those someone who clearly said you know said unity of the Christianity of the wall I've been possible as say for this world this message from Jefferson field you know now miss everything he thought that message was from Jeff but the message from heaven so automatically we will see Christianity is a christen press the Lord God bless you the greatest exploitation where are the world what are you a believer what is better for us because it's coming to give us blessing privacy is coming to cause the world is coming will cause the unbeliever is coming will be blessing to me on you because we will follow him and they will begin to enjoy the wedding feast all all right millennion rheticus father no other moment no regrets wide world is punishing Sabri we are going higher and higher there is already coming a post Quad City who it ready for me on you that's why to lows everything give us to hear today we say use it here you don't need in heaven all the gifts or anything that God gave to you duty use it for the purpose of God and God's children you don't need here that is why you don't need to pack your money in the bank and say oh if said give us come today your money become the thing for the Antichrist I will be happy at the Africa you give the table money whatever you have use it for the purpose of God and you are sure already reward for you and for me praise the Lord so many thing added that I just want to discuss and they called you we are not doing Augustin in vain there's a lot of blessing ahead of you and me I'm with not pastor that says ooh or anybody it is ghost world and he said even before Jesus said I am going there to prepare what it please for you ever each one also I won't tell you which is austere loss life God's children with Jesus tell us life even my little know that like and this is Jesus from generous revelation is Jesus Christ every of his world is ye and even God blesses so I said God doesn't change whatever Isis is he sees whatever I mean is it what mean I'm Robin was ten rows in another message second coming of the Lord fifty-seven self was seventeen said now we are living at a terrible time I said all world is living to their type then Christian was delivering to our own type say look at it right from the Old Testament there are many many times pictures in Old Testament pertaining to the second coming of Christ is so much more than even the best coming the world up coming coming second one is small in this Bible that even is first coming why because the second coming means more to us human race than the first one amen you know the first one is to call and die and resurrect for us but this second coming is so great I'm so important that even from Genesis you have been talkin abou second coming but people hated in fact no touch again the domination the kaabah second coming all the one is prosperity prosperity and that is why the Bible tell don't look at that let them prosper all will be had here that's why province a look at our Lord when the disciples were pointing to him of the big temple that I told us say all these things you don't put your mind in that it will become grand and today I told you if you had a body good yet you go and check ask all the temple that I've abused or become nothing right now to most I stand in there was it why everybody you say what I tried disciple that I was at the sawdust temple that who breathing was breed there's no place for any mater shocking or any no no no Hama is the only house can be built without ya know Hama Rousseau so in so magnificent so big but is I said don't look at that I am today you cannot even see anything the foundation yeah so don't put your mind on anything kana or physical we are going to get better battle and it's already promised for you and me whatever you do Xavier is nothing God already owed imitating for us but I said why is this great coming of the law was so important - the Bible DT today is because is all so many things for us as his whole problem for the world was blessing for the believers amen the Lord coming is for some people to come and receive you will receive from people himself then is coming to condemn the world so it's coming so important and so great that he as we repeating and the according in the Bible everywhere you go why it calls to the people and a blessing to the believers amen a being such a I said I mean that this is a sort of I taught in think everyone of us I saw hundreds of God was walk and look solemnly take time to take an infinity of our life whether we are waiting for him whether we is coming with Gladys you I will cost you but I know as long as I believed in word of life repaired baptized in his name prematurely goes is too much contamination there's no more contamination for the other waters already in Christ Jesus I know you cannot go on will let go on to any wrong because you know it is wrong press the Lord so it's not I'm not talking of a mini or anything but I'm telling you the truth a child of God we're not going Willie something wrong by mistake but God asked already before fish on for that the blood of Joe Christ is for us you go help us somebody came and died for you and for me then you will not lose you it's not possible now I'm not only that before I become requirement think of vanity at all yes thought of you and me so anything that's why I said none of this kind lost is not possible like we know alley ideology level so salt lost the first King of history once he lost we by buried us soul is very di Impala dies now one of these days where we all die will see him instead of going to hell what happened to him the Bible says is this was caught shot same day this in and Sun goes a societies if you decided that you want to go wrong way God is more than abou we just tell you come moon in this our age you don't need about a lot of future who said you want you don't want to preach again want to be drinking beer say proverb say I told you don't do that don't do that say with him fathers called call you don't go that way young God would when God warned you listen to his warning who is weird because he loved you we all know now every child we love is home with it rebuked now if you don't let you go now that I said I will steady heritage of soul when you read these things and luckily Disney let them give you check what did I give to God why does he love me like this that is what we do see style you go just some problem said I met the young man in California said you put here I am a fool for Christ and then who school are you see every one of us on hot here we might be a fool for somebody like me I am a fool for Christ I am proud to be a fool for him why all that you know the awful force it on I will wake up I lit the money and we are going to defeat riding one like that salty if we blew something what does it mean what does it agree was something genu we are talking of yourself heaven like bringing good that no important give me for free the Lord bless you but once it is so importance at least every crystal Janka all must check our take it's time for us to take our infantry because is coming is so imminent so we have you seen it and the Bible said it was all who is is coming it had been said that is when it will come because people have forgotten about it now the dust will arrive - cumbria and live when you have no we come here to display him and go back to him and then it would bring us back here to come and enjoy when all this thing not be here he got happy applause I pray to help us but I say if you know our distance is to truly treat our hearts I make all scream several time because we can remember said the preview of it was shown to John the Revelator on the partners of ice as a fast was at my place as my personal maybe as I speak to this a thing if I come here brother when he saw it he saw the blessing ahead and what is to be God before this old world then you say calm Lord Jesus it's like don't want him to be coming down I know but you cannot come then because it's got to wait for you and me you shall be important those people the Bible said they are not complete on you and me come there we are so important to God we got happy front of us so he said if shortly lead is at and was screaming oh it was so low come Jesus it says so also today when we hear a reminders of the coming of the Lord used to treat our heart it may cause joy happy and scream hi and he said Lord I'm also expecting you but as I know many would not respect him wherever you think your life is known I'd say but let me tell you whether you aspect or not is coming now so what you have to do is line up with him because it's not it's not going to less stand up for anybody is God not starting with that is Almighty whatever he says that it is finance right many times when we pray and we would think that girl calm down go who now calm down is you you lifted up to him when you get you standard we got a purpose god bless you church praise the Lord as I told you when your time we would think of this without you still that is good but one say anything God said let's settle your man is year and Eamon nothing can change it no addition no suppression that is why it doesn't need anybody's idea it doesn't need you open you whatever I want to say whatever I want to do yeah I said it you may believe you don't believe it does I but that is why don't

whoa [Music] Holly this morning for bringing us the word as fast I chose a new ideal of dawn from Nigeria by the way tabernacle he said daddy senior pastor [Music] the first 25 years [Music] [Music] the second 25 years is that the time to seek after career work in your career to achieve things that you want when a person getting here 25 he says there they have seen everything you have seen everything under the Sun and the a desire starts to look for a word beyond this praise of God how fitting now bus leave coming preach to us on the greatest expectation because that is expectation any expectation of meaning of our other brothers and sisters is to leave this world this age and disposition is completely different from the air the air age the new the neighbor the COO they could laugh and I mean if you just joke this time you don't even know what is joke you said something to somebody to just get stole they just turn up I mean they were friendly they could drink from a cup and somebody said give me in the water in the ticket it ring it we just saw sensitizing it in everything [Music] diseases that he never heard in their days we see it all over the place but I'll tell you this morning change that is the only hope that is left for this world the coming of the Lord that's the only hope that is left for this world and it's now something that is coming is here I can prove it to you from the scripture that is here it's already here I'll give you a quick speed in your Bible Revelation chapter 2 verse 5 a very quick speed in your Bible he said behold I come quickly that was to the efficient church age Revelation chapter 2 verse 5 Revelation chapter 2 verse 11 he repeated again he said behold I come quickly that was to the next church 8 the seminole church age Revelation chapter 2 verse 20 25 he repeated again still talking about him coming amen [Music] Revelation chapter 2 verse 25 he repeated to five he says I come quickly least a cut of your candlestick to verse 11 he says he he repeated again to the seminal church age [Music] to verse 25 he speaks again to the charity right church age he says but at wish you have already hold hold fast till I can't till I come be who I come quickly to I come I'm still coming then chapter 3 verse 3 remember therefore how there has received and heard hold fast and repent and in therefore there shall now watch I will come I will come he's dead and now seeing I would come chapter 3 verse 11 to the next church age that the Philadelphia Church in he said behold I come quickly but when it came to the Lord in church age which historian and biblical scholars have proven that this is the age that we live in Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 he said behold a span now that I'm coming but behold as Pan Am and I said Austin he has already arrived he kept a now CBO account pijo account because the religious world has this picture that will see injures in the heaven that's the reason why the preacher said when a dear brick today today didn't make a sound didn't make us I was there bound that go bomb is Sunday you slap and enter into Sunday you never even knew how Saturday passed and so they came and you just woke up yet it was Sunday he kept announcing through the church ages before I come I come quickly I come quickly but true the ministry of mark I fall he said behold I stand at the door and knock it's no time to play Church if you want to that's your business [Music] the church used to be one of the most serious bliss in the world but now church is one of the more dangerous place because you have people coming sitting right in the church dealing with things in their lives [Music] dealing with things in their lives what are we making this girl to be who is he to you oh but he's the same yesterday today and forever this rapture is not a fairy tale it's right before our eyes it's affecting our life it's changing our habits [Music] where the preacher has already preached praise the Lord but I just want to encourage you we are living in rapture in days don't look for it coming is already here it's already here don't look for it coming this is Jesus own words behold I stand at the door and knock and where'd or is he standing now is knocking at your heart knocking at your hot dog trying to show himself to you more than the church came more than the pastor came he want a personal relationship with you [Music] you [Music] what Allah bless you it was good to have a trilogy playing the saxophone you know for being almost 2 years now I have been looking for a teacher that can teach Wayne instrument which is Sansa phone trumpet and or death in a phone one young gentleman very good that can teach Wayne instrument so I talked to him and all of that and but I've been kind of waiting for the appropriate time and then Jimmy to come alone and he tells me Nicky here he's been learning the salsa phone then his brother come and tell me he can play the trombone I said well I got a bad one praise the Lord I said God is going to fulfill my my desire and a couple of weeks ago brother Ariel spoke to me and talking about some projects and singers and I like I said this before maybe a few couple of years back we announced it and but the way we announce it it was almost looking like a law you know because we want people singing specials to practice with a musician the reason is because you have this young man sitting on the base you have this brother on the piano and you get a sister's there on the violin and then you come and sing a song and they can support you [Music] because even if the know the song they are they had to follow your your way of singing to be able to put music to the Sun so it was now like it's something that you forced to do but it's something that is right to do [Music] because if he's trying to put music to your song and why you are singing some time before he find the music you are already done singing [Music] now in your mind you are thinking because they are musicians that you know the minister's not playing right away they don't work like that it don't work like that and that is the reason why we're trying to introduce practice and for those that would love to sing come around it's not about you you must realize we said that Wednesday night it's not about you it's about him so if you get in your mind my son is a special special to you not to him you are coming to praise Him and just like he gave you the gift to sing he also gave them to give to play instrument so why if we bring all of our gifts together to glorify Him won't that be a beautiful now so since I have somebody that is learning the trombone and somebody that is learning the saxophone I'm going to engage my teacher we got myself I'm part of it too I'm learning out maybe I play the trumpet or the flu but the reason is the other we we won't to get our young people involved amen we want to get them involved the young people they follow their parents they love the Lord that comes to church sometimes it's hard for them to follow what the preacher is preaching so for a period of time they might just be in church and just feel like they're not involved Church just look bow to them but if they can come and sing a song whether it's a small singing group or whether they're playing an instrument and let me tell you I'm going to put a lot of discipline to it if you can't come on time stare to your house there is no special player on the team if you were not about by our rules state just stay by yourself [Music] so if you want to be part you better think about it and I told area the same I said when you doing music practice put some discipline to it [Music] because this is the King's business we don't make look there is no special person in this house the only special man is our Lord Jesus Christ nobody is above this word so he might be getting your numbers to put you on different schedules that he will be working with whatever he want to do he has the burden for reading and so I just pray that girl who bless him I'm not going to order him what he's going to do but those that are out of you young people that are interested in in wind instrument trumpet everything you talk to Timothy you'll make a team we work on the day I will talk to the teacher and I will get him down here and he can be able to work with you people whether it is one time in the month or twice in a month you'll be able to work for you people so we can put ourself together how to try to play the trombone to my house I just taught when he plays and he might blow this wall out and that is the way we might get a bigger Church how did that Jericho wall came down and we buy the trumpet and I prayed to God for the bigger Church and whichever way he's going to do it I'm ready to take it amen if we start worshiping and the roof fall out glory be to God I know that he's the one that we worship in he got to bring especially in this cold season it is war fall down you got to do something quickly [Music] well it just it just goodies just to encourage you people young people praise the Lord you get better area number and you want to sing a special send him a text and say brother I want to sing this song now they make him to look at the soul he has the other musicians number he can send them text or let's practice this song go on YouTube listening to the song we have to do things all the way we are worshipping God and God love order when we try our best it puts smile on his face it's not one person and the other person maybe they are oppressing your best singer year praise the Lord but as Kat told you there this morning [Music] and he's one of the person that been involved in trying to involve everybody there was one year we had we had every family singing every family singing you can sing who pull you out from the Benji and we come into that place maybe you will stay out of church and when you keep staying out of church I wait for the day that you oh you are in church I will call you to sing your special praise the Lord because the one and I can sit in the back row that one and I can be analyzed II it was too sharp it was too flat well we love the Lord he made praise the Lord well I just stand on our feet and sing this morning amen my voice is not too good but I will use the best use it to the glory of the Lord
