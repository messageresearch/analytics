[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] this church age that we're living in that the son of man would be revealed again in the same manner it was as it was at Sodom watch how historically he gave it he said as it was in the days first of Noah how they were eating drinking Mary and giving a marriage then he brought next the last the son of man and son that was there he was dealing with Jews here at Sodom he's dealing with Gentiles there he dreaded of all the water and judgment here if the Gentiles he burn them all at the day of sung that's right the Gentile World burnt there and so will it be when the Son of Man reveals there's not no more water but it'll be fire this time Jesus read from the same Genesis 23 that we read from it when he read about Solomon now we admit the conditions that spoke of are the world condition of Sodom sodomites Sodom conditions we everyone will say Amen to that we believe that all right in the spiritual condition of Lady arcea the church natural we'll say Amen to that and accept their signs we know that every sign is Earth the church is in laosia we know that we know the world is in a Sodom condition is that right we'll accept that but what about the sign of Abraham the one waiting for the Thomas son that was another remember they had a Sodom back there they had their messenger and Abraham had a messenger to him Abraham was waiting day by day for us almost an impossible thing to happen Sarah 90 and him 100 according to the promise of God he was still waiting in the midst of all criticism he was waiting for that song so is a True Believer still waiting for that promised son to return notice just before the sun arrived there was a sign given him is not the sign of the coming son to be revealed to the Royal seat of Abraham that's waiting for the royal son as same as it was to Father Abraham for the natural son and that right amen Jesus said so here in Saint Luke 17 30. before this time come that the son of man would be revealed like he did in the days of Sodom before the destruction of Sodom now we're looking for a son now let's take the conditions of time as it was in Saturn notice that all went out in sodomite the world I think one of the movie directors put on a picture not long ago and I got to see it that was Sodom if you ever see it there's nothing else on with that take a look at it it's certainly a good picture of the United States today Hollywood just exactly same kind of dressing everything else that they did is right then big drunken sprees and everything else a religious Cult of people so-called religious notice and Sodom had a witness and it was a fellow in the Name of Love which was just a nephew to to Abraham now Abraham did not go down in Sodom he and his group he had a big group with him enough to fight off about a dozen Kings in their army so he had a big group with him and he was sitting out there under an oak tree one day when everything was going wrong friend nobody had anything to do with him but he was still holding on to that promise watch him closely before we close while he was sitting there down come three men walking to him two of them went down into Sodom and preached the gospel to them to come out to love is that right but one stayed with Abraham notice the one that stayed with Abraham was God himself [Music] the other two were Angel Messengers [Music] and preaching the gospel always might Sublime I look at the set of that date there is a church natural always the threes as I said last night God is represented there were sodomites the luddites and the abrahamites it's in this same position tonight the world's setting just like that let me ask you something look at this setting up Abraham called this man to talk to him Elohim the Hebrew word Elohim means the all-sufficient one that one that's the Eternal one Elohim God himself in the beginning Genesis once that in beginning God take the Hebrew word there in a Greek word rather in the beginning Elohim created heavens and earth there he is Genesis about 22 here he says again or about uh 20 he said and he called this man's name Elohim why did he do it God represented in a human flesh that's set down with Abraham and eat a cash sandwich drinking some milk and eat some bread God himself has disappeared right before Abraham but he give him a sign notice and that sign was that he had his back turned to the tent and remember Abraham his name was Abram a few days before that and Sarah was Sarah before that s-a-r-r-a then s-a-r-a-h-m-a-b-ram to a b r a h a m Abraham he's father a nation now watch real close here and we'll see the setting all the hour that we're now living as Jesus told us to look for this setting we've seen all the rest of it right now let's see to the Royal Sea what setting they're supposed to see now this man said Abraham where is your wife Sarah and Abraham said she's in the tent behind you now you've never seen her how do you know that his name was Abraham how do you know her name was s-a-r-a-h Abraham where is your wife Sarah said she's in the tit behind you he said ah ah personal pronoun I am going to visit you according to the promise your wife's gonna have that baby you've trust me now I'm going to make you come to pass and Sarah in the tent behind eavesdropping or ear dropping or what you call it listen to the tent she said laughed up her sleeping she said now I'm me an old woman like I am have pleasured my Lord and him old two out there 100 years old while this hasn't happened for many many years and the man m-a-n sitting there eating in human flesh drinking and eating like an ordinary man with dust on his post and had dust on his feet and Abraham worked at all God himself looked around and he said why did Sarah laugh back in the 10th Sanders he knew could discern the thoughts of Sarah in the tent behind him is that right now when the Royal Seed of Abraham come on the earth what sign did he show it's not amazed Simon came up to him one day Andrew brought him he said your name is Simon you're the son of Jonas he said I made a Believer out of me Philip went over and got Nathaniel come back said come see a man who we have we've found Jesus of Nazareth son of Joseph he said now wait a minute could anything good come out of that fanaticism he said come see so would Philip come up in the presence of Jesus with Nathanael Jesus looked over at him and said behold in Israelite in whom there's no God he said Rabbi when did you know me he said before Philip calls you when you were out of the tree I saw you said rabbi what when the little woman at the well in her immoral condition come up a little panoramic something like this to draw some water Jesus and send his disciples away and get fiddles did it all water he said bring me a drink woman she said it's not customary for you to say that we have segregation here now you Jews have nothing to do with us Samaritans we have nothing to do with you he said but woman if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink I'd give you Waters you don't come here to draw he found work condition month what it was he said go get your husband and come here she said I don't have any husband he said you said the truth you've had five and the one you're living with now is our church she said sir I perceive that power to put they evolved when the Messiah cometh he'll show us these things Jesus said I am he well that she run into the City and said come see a man who's told me the things I've done isn't this a very Messiah watch he did that before the Jews and the Samaritans but never the Gentiles the Gentiles we people were heathens in them days the other nations pecked the club on her back worshiping Islands we wasn't looking for no Messiah he only appears to those who is looking for him and we are supposed to be looking for him but those who claim to be looking for it the church itself when they seen that done they said he's a devil he's a fortune teller Jesus said that sin would be forgiven him because he hadn't died yet but since Sunday the Holy Ghost will come and do the same thing and to speak one word against it will never be forgiven that's this day where every word has to hang together speak a word against he'll never be forgiven in this world of the world to come that was the royal Seed of Abraham and you're that Royal Seed of Abraham which come because of that identification of that man standing there with Abraham come to prove it was the same God promised in this day as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when he is revealing himself as son of a man amen [Music] this is a day for the scripture to be fulfilled look at the setting we are today look at that church where the Son of God look at the dismalade look at all the prophecies not a strange thing our businesses are due then if the study has to be like it's Sovereign there were three of them come along three outstanding men sent from heaven will admit that amen three of them one state but Abraham they all started there but one state with Abraham the rest of them went out inside them is that right and Abraham had a changed name from Abram to Abraham true not one time has the history of Church of the world ever had an evangelist to go to it with a name ending in h-a-m to this day Billy g-r-a-h-a-m is that right g-r-a-h-a-m-6 letters a-b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters but g-r-a-h-a-m is six letters which is the world man see look what's went out there today is that Messengers from heaven is there a man on Earth that's got repentance so preach so plainly as Billy Graham has there been a man that has had effects upon the people like Billy Graham never has there been internationally a man old Billy Sunday and so forth is here in the United States but Billy Graham's known worldwide see where he's calling out of Sodom and he's got his company party there with the Pentecostal Church on Oral Roberts but what about the elect group what kind of sign are they supposed to see what are they supposed to have Hallelujah it shall be nine times this day this scripture is fulfilled [Applause] [Music] this day God's promise is fulfilled we know that to be the truth he's sure tonight as he was saying not a preaching that I said a while ago if you preach anything and it's a gospel truth then God's obligated Divinity then is that true now if that be so let the god that read the word let the god that made the prophecy Let The God Who is God of the word come forth thank you and prove that he's still God as Elijah went up on the mountain watching Elisha went watching Elijah he said I want a double potion and a man that was only Elijah fell off on Elijah he walked down in double that blanket up and stuck the river and said where is the god of Elijah and the same thing that happened for Elijah happening for Elijah and the same gospel the same power the same son of man that was yesterday it is the day and will be forever [Music] you believe it and I asked you I cannot be him but he is here we are only a terrier some of you people out there that sick and afflicted that you know that I don't know you this is God now if I can humble myself enough you pray and ask God I don't guess there is a prayer for her to build the answer no I don't we've ever give out any prayer of course we're going to have prayer
