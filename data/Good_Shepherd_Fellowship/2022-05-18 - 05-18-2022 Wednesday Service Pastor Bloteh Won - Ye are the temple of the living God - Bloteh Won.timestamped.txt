[51:49] reading from verse 14.
[52:05] be in that
[52:07] unequally yoked together with
[52:09] unbelievers
[52:10] for what fellowship have righteousness

[52:25] with bill
[52:26] or what part have he
[52:29] they are believing
[52:30] with an infeeder
[52:34] and what agreement
[52:36] have the temple
[52:38] of god
[52:40] with idols
[52:42] i want to read that again and what
[52:44] agreement have the temple
[52:46] of god with idols
[52:49] for ye are
[52:51] the temple of the living god
[52:54] as god have said i will endure in them
[52:59] and walk
[53:00] in them
[53:02] i will endure it in them
[53:05] and walk in them
[53:07] and i will be their god

[53:13] my people
[53:15] praise the lord
[53:18] let's turn to revelation chapter 2.
[53:42] praise the lord
[53:58] it's a talk that i had in uh
[54:01] on my heart tonight and
[54:03] i'm trying to
[54:06] to
[54:09] see how we can uh
[54:13] whether we will start it up tonight or
[54:15] whether
[54:16] uh i mean that's what the law we want us
[54:19] to kind of forward on
[54:21] tonight
[54:23] but i trust that
[54:25] the law will be able to
[54:28] bring something from out of faith
[54:31] something
[54:32] that
[54:34] that would help each and every one of us
[54:37] praise the lord
[54:39] and we know that this is uh
[54:43] the
[54:45] the message to the church ages
[54:48] this morning
[54:50] as a family we read this particular
[54:52] chapter
[54:53] and then uh
[54:55] [Music]
[54:58] i was i was telling the family let's let
[55:00] let me read what i want us to read then
[55:02] that i will not keep you alone verse 8
[55:04] let's read verse 8 the message to the
[55:06] second church age
[55:09] and unto the angels of the church of
[55:11] samuel wright these things said the
[55:13] first and the last
[55:16] which was dead and is alive i know that
[55:20] works
[55:22] in tribulation and poverty
[55:25] but thou
[55:27] i reach
[55:29] and i know
[55:31] the blasphemer of them we say they are
[55:35] jews
[55:37] and are not but they are senegals
[55:41] of satan father
[55:43] we will ask tonight
[55:44] that lord your divine spirit
[55:47] will come and help us lord
[55:49] as we have revealed ourselves tonight
[55:52] oh god to be in your house lord
[55:55] your people
[55:56] have
[55:57] shown up tonight lord and even the once
[56:00] lord father that are streaming from home
[56:03] have set aside everything lord god and
[56:06] created an atmosphere father lord that
[56:08] god there will be no distance tonight or
[56:11] father we can be fair right
[56:14] from
[56:15] your throne to our heart lord
[56:17] oh god and we just ask your blessings
[56:20] now upon your word
[56:22] in the name of the lord jesus we pray
[56:24] amen
[56:26] the lord bless you you may have your
[56:28] seeds
[56:31] there are some uh
[56:33] there's some history
[56:35] that i would have loved to associate
[56:37] with this tonight so
[56:39] it will it will it will it will have to
[56:41] cause me to go back in and gather the
[56:44] history because i didn't put that
[56:46] together as a note
[56:48] for you
[56:50] but uh
[56:51] just like i said we read this chapter
[56:53] and i was i was trying to tell the
[56:56] uh the folks at home that uh
[56:58] one thing that stands out to me in this
[57:01] chapter is the way that jesus introduced
[57:04] himself
[57:05] to every age
[57:08] and is very very important
[57:11] praise the lord
[57:12] because we can we can watch out for the
[57:14] days of the nicolaitan we can look at
[57:17] you know uh uh
[57:19] the doctrine of bilaam and we can look
[57:21] at
[57:22] all of these things but if you miss the
[57:24] identification of jesus christ in every
[57:28] age
[57:29] praise the lord because we know that
[57:31] he's identified by his characteristics
[57:35] amen and he identified himself in the in
[57:38] the ephesian age
[57:40] as uh
[57:41] he that hold up the seventh star
[57:44] you know he holded the seventh side
[57:47] uh in his right hand
[57:51] and he's the same one that is walking in
[57:54] the midst that's right
[57:56] off the seventh golden candlestick
[58:00] praise the lord
[58:02] and as we learn also from uh
[58:08] uh how can i overcome the prophecy every
[58:11] preceding age you know has the benefit
[58:14] from uh the age before it so
[58:17] he started walking
[58:19] in in the in the ephesian church age
[58:22] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[58:24] candlestick and he's the one that have
[58:28] uh the seven styles in chapter one
[58:30] you'll realize in the last verse the
[58:33] mystery of the seventh start in his
[58:34] right hand were the seven messengers
[58:37] praise the lord
[58:39] and the seven golden candlesticks was
[58:41] the seven church ages
[58:44] so he's holding those messengers in his
[58:47] hands
[58:48] as he's walking
[58:50] in the midst of the seven
[58:54] church ages
[58:56] it's important to know that
[58:58] identification of jesus
[59:01] that he did not stop in the first age
[59:03] but he's walking
[59:08] amen
[59:09] he's walking in the midst of the seven
[59:13] golden candlestick and he has the
[59:15] messengers in his hands
[59:19] praise the lord
[59:22] and
[59:25] to the second church age
[59:27] verse 8 he identified himself
[59:30] as the first and the last
[59:35] the first and the last the alpha and
[59:37] omega
[59:39] which was dead
[59:41] and is alive
[59:43] that his that was his identification to
[59:46] that church age
[59:48] we are now serving uh uh uh
[59:52] one that is still in the grave he is a
[59:54] raising savior
[59:55] [Music]
[59:58] praise the lord amen just just ignoring
[1:00:02] the identification of the one that have
[1:00:05] called you is very important
[1:00:09] if everything will fail if everything
[1:00:12] will when that will not stick out to you
[1:00:15] but you have
[1:00:16] to know the one that have called you
[1:00:20] praise the lord
[1:00:22] very very important
[1:00:26] on to the pagamus church age he
[1:00:28] identified himself
[1:00:30] as the one that have the chapter as
[1:00:33] swole
[1:00:35] which of course hebrew 4 12 tells us is
[1:00:38] the word of god
[1:00:43] praise the lord
[1:00:46] and uh
[1:00:47] and on and on
[1:00:49] on and on we can go
[1:00:51] uh onto the territorial church age
[1:00:54] he identified himself
[1:00:58] as the son of god
[1:01:01] praise the lord
[1:01:02] he identified himself as the son of god
[1:01:06] who have his eyes like
[1:01:08] onto a flame of fire
[1:01:11] and his feet like
[1:01:14] fine brian's
[1:01:16] and what is beautiful about this also
[1:01:19] is that
[1:01:22] he identified himself that way to the
[1:01:24] edge
[1:01:26] but yet those eyes that are like flame
[1:01:29] of fire
[1:01:31] is the eyes that looks upon us
[1:01:34] and becomes so precious
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:38] his eyes that have looked beyond our
[1:01:41] fart
[1:01:42] and he was able to meet us
[1:01:45] at every point of our needs
[1:01:48] praise the lord
[1:01:49] i've always i've always desired to find
[1:01:53] a time to talk on
[1:01:55] the the identification of christ
[1:01:58] in every age that is not what i'm doing
[1:02:00] tonight tonight i want to look at
[1:02:03] we've been talking about the priests
[1:02:05] we've been talking about paul
[1:02:08] you know trying to
[1:02:10] elevate exhort jesus
[1:02:13] above the old testament coveting
[1:02:16] but there is something and and this
[1:02:19] little piece of uh uh history that i was
[1:02:21] going to bring to you was going to be
[1:02:23] very important
[1:02:24] and i will try to do that on sunday if
[1:02:27] if uh
[1:02:28] if we we are not led into something else
[1:02:31] but
[1:02:31] what i want us to do tonight is that
[1:02:35] in
[1:02:38] verse 9
[1:02:40] the bible
[1:02:42] speaks here
[1:02:44] this is jesus speaking he says i know
[1:02:46] your works i know the tribulation your
[1:02:48] poverty but thou are rich
[1:02:50] spiritually
[1:02:52] and also
[1:02:53] he he says
[1:02:55] i know
[1:02:57] the blasphemer of them which say that
[1:02:59] they are jews
[1:03:01] and are not
[1:03:04] but they are synagogues of satan
[1:03:08] now i want to talk
[1:03:10] the difference between the cynicals
[1:03:13] and the temple
[1:03:18] the difference between the synagogues
[1:03:21] and the temple
[1:03:23] because you what what i want us to
[1:03:26] realize is that when jesus came
[1:03:30] when he was born there was no temple
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:36] they only have synagogues
[1:03:42] praise the lord
[1:03:44] now
[1:03:45] temple
[1:03:46] uh uh
[1:03:48] is it all from the old testament
[1:03:50] tabernacle
[1:03:53] praise the lord
[1:03:56] one of the major difference between the
[1:03:58] temple and the synagogues
[1:04:02] is sacrifice
[1:04:08] is sacrifice
[1:04:13] now what what i want us to look at
[1:04:16] tonight
[1:04:17] this is a prayer meeting night okay
[1:04:20] praise the lord
[1:04:21] so let's let's just let's just relax
[1:04:24] amen let's just relax and just and just
[1:04:27] and just meditate
[1:04:30] and just you know
[1:04:32] allow the lord to
[1:04:34] deal with us with the few minutes that
[1:04:35] is left before us
[1:04:38] but
[1:04:39] if you realize here paul is talking to
[1:04:42] the corinthian church he's talking to
[1:04:44] the people
[1:04:46] he's talking to the people
[1:04:50] he's not talking about a building he's
[1:04:52] talking to the people
[1:04:56] and he's saying
[1:04:58] ye are the temple
[1:05:01] of the living god
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:05] people
[1:05:06] are the temple and jesus here is also
[1:05:10] identifying another group of people
[1:05:14] people
[1:05:18] yes people
[1:05:19] and he's calling them
[1:05:21] the senegals of satan
[1:05:24] so the synagogues of satan
[1:05:26] and the temple of the living god
[1:05:34] bless you lord are we together
[1:05:37] and just like i said the difference
[1:05:39] between the synagogues
[1:05:41] and the temple
[1:05:43] is what
[1:05:46] sacrifice
[1:05:50] sacrifice
[1:05:52] so you see when we sing their little son
[1:05:55] we bring the sacrifice of praise
[1:06:00] onto the you see so
[1:06:04] so uh uh uh i want you to keep that in
[1:06:07] the back of your mind because uh
[1:06:09] uh
[1:06:10] if if the law wants to to deal with this
[1:06:12] subject they have they are things that
[1:06:14] we'll be trading on
[1:06:16] as we as we talk about it
[1:06:19] but
[1:06:23] these blasphemers
[1:06:26] which they are
[1:06:30] jews they are jews
[1:06:35] they say they are jews
[1:06:37] they say they are jews they say they are
[1:06:40] message believers they say they are holy
[1:06:42] ghosts feel people they say they are
[1:06:44] christians
[1:06:48] praise the lord
[1:06:50] they say they are christians
[1:06:52] they say they are believers they say
[1:06:55] they are jews they say they are message
[1:06:57] believers they say they have the holy
[1:06:59] ghost and not of that
[1:07:01] but
[1:07:02] the spirit of christ
[1:07:04] jesus christ
[1:07:07] looking at what was going to
[1:07:10] to run
[1:07:11] in the
[1:07:13] in the christian church
[1:07:18] realized that there was going to be
[1:07:21] uh this thing that was going to happen
[1:07:23] here they say they are jews
[1:07:26] and annette
[1:07:28] but they are senegas
[1:07:31] of satan
[1:07:33] praise the lord
[1:07:34] now
[1:07:35] you'll realize that the
[1:07:37] the the uh the phrase synagogues of
[1:07:40] satan is used used twice in in the
[1:07:44] church age and it was the two time it's
[1:07:46] used is is identifying a group of people
[1:07:51] it's used is
[1:07:53] identified in a group of people
[1:07:56] are we together
[1:07:58] praise the lord amen
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:02] now the thing that is major
[1:08:05] of the synagogues
[1:08:08] the synagogues was a place
[1:08:12] of
[1:08:13] teaching
[1:08:17] it was a place where they go and read
[1:08:19] the lord
[1:08:20] and and they go in and they are being
[1:08:22] instructed
[1:08:26] praise the lord
[1:08:29] they can go
[1:08:30] and and and i mean they can argue they
[1:08:33] can go and show their understanding and
[1:08:36] their wisdom
[1:08:38] and uh you know and then how many
[1:08:40] sermons they have read
[1:08:42] you know
[1:08:43] how acquainted they are with the bible
[1:08:46] but in the temple
[1:08:49] which was after the old testament
[1:08:52] tabernacle
[1:08:54] it was a place
[1:08:55] of sacrifice
[1:08:59] it was a place
[1:09:01] of worship
[1:09:04] it was a place that was that was built
[1:09:08] for the people
[1:09:10] to come in contact with god that's right
[1:09:13] that's right
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:18] praise the lord
[1:09:20] the prophet habakkuk who said the lord
[1:09:22] is in his holy temple
[1:09:25] let the earth
[1:09:29] keep silent
[1:09:31] so in the temple
[1:09:34] is god that is doing the talking
[1:09:38] in the synonyms is man that is doing the
[1:09:41] talking
[1:09:50] are we together
[1:09:56] in the temple
[1:09:58] is god that is doing
[1:10:00] the talking the lord is in his holy
[1:10:03] temple let the earth keep silence
[1:10:05] i mean when even the high priest i mean
[1:10:08] all of those people there the way they
[1:10:09] walk they watch their full step you know
[1:10:12] very quiet you know very
[1:10:14] you know very reverent
[1:10:17] because they knew
[1:10:19] that this was a time where they are
[1:10:21] coming in communion with god
[1:10:24] but when you go to the synagogues you
[1:10:26] see all of those tracks you know there
[1:10:29] yeah they are going
[1:10:31] to the synagogues they get their books
[1:10:34] under the arm
[1:10:38] the men see them like the holy men that
[1:10:40] are coming
[1:10:41] they have in the books
[1:10:43] you know
[1:10:44] praise the lord if they were in our day
[1:10:46] they would be having rolling suitcase
[1:10:48] briefcase
[1:10:50] of books to show how they are level
[1:10:54] of understanding
[1:10:57] wow that guy
[1:10:58] man
[1:11:00] if i can just touch the box
[1:11:03] you know as i get close to the temple
[1:11:05] the temple god you have to bring it
[1:11:10] right
[1:11:14] don't throw the boat down
[1:11:26] praise the lord
[1:11:35] glory be to god
[1:11:40] just like i said we will get
[1:11:42] a little bit of history around yeti
[1:11:44] and show
[1:11:46] uh you are bringing this information to
[1:11:48] you
[1:11:49] uh didn't
[1:11:50] put them together in the in the note
[1:11:52] form tonight and to be able to share
[1:11:54] that with you
[1:11:57] but you see uh
[1:11:59] that's the reason why
[1:12:02] you realize that jesus
[1:12:04] in his ethnic ministry was not fond
[1:12:07] of the synagogues
[1:12:11] he was not fond of the synagogues
[1:12:15] because
[1:12:17] it was not a place that was actually
[1:12:20] bringing the people in contact with god
[1:12:23] it was a place that was that was uh you
[1:12:26] know
[1:12:27] they were they were
[1:12:29] they were kind of for
[1:12:31] uh changing the minds of the people they
[1:12:33] were they were teaching them
[1:12:36] i call into the lord i call him to
[1:12:40] the i believe
[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:44] in one sense to brainwash the people
[1:12:48] by using the law
[1:12:53] that the very word that they were they
[1:12:55] were they were they were reading in the
[1:12:56] temple came to them in flesh and they
[1:12:59] could not identify it
[1:13:01] yes yes
[1:13:06] it's because they went to the synagogues
[1:13:09] and they were they were they were
[1:13:10] teaching them you know and moses said
[1:13:12] that they could line up all the
[1:13:14] prophecies
[1:13:16] but in doing that
[1:13:20] they were blinding the people
[1:13:26] in doing that they were blinding
[1:13:29] the people
[1:13:33] but that's that's the that's the
[1:13:35] you know that's that's the literal
[1:13:37] synonymous but what i'm trying to bring
[1:13:39] bring to us here tonight
[1:13:41] is that uh
[1:13:46] the the reason why
[1:13:48] we have been redeemed
[1:13:51] praise the lord
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:54] let's go back there to that uh
[1:13:56] second corinthians chapter six
[1:14:03] you realize you see brother brahm said
[1:14:05] that
[1:14:06] you know he says he says that's the
[1:14:08] reason why we can we can't get much out
[1:14:11] of god because
[1:14:13] of the lack of sacrifice
[1:14:16] [Music]
[1:14:20] because that's that's what it is that's
[1:14:22] that's what
[1:14:24] worship without sacrifice
[1:14:27] the worship is not accepted
[1:14:31] praise the lord
[1:14:36] amen i mean if we if we just get so we
[1:14:39] get so uh uh stuck into our own ways in
[1:14:43] our own mindset without with it i mean
[1:14:46] even as we as we come to the house of
[1:14:48] god that's the reason why we have to let
[1:14:51] go and let the lord have his way we have
[1:14:53] to surround ourselves we i mean we have
[1:14:56] to yell to the spirit of god we have to
[1:14:58] surround ourselves and and really be in
[1:15:00] the spirit of worship
[1:15:03] as the spirit of worship that is not
[1:15:05] detected by the drums or by the by the
[1:15:07] guitar or by the piano and and and i
[1:15:10] mean we are worshiping praise the lord
[1:15:13] amen we are worshiping
[1:15:16] glory be to god
[1:15:21] i mean water is water is a a fast sound
[1:15:24] or a slow song we are worshiping our
[1:15:26] heart is to express to the lord
[1:15:30] amen we sing in the name of jesus in the
[1:15:33] name of jesus we have the victory oh
[1:15:35] thank god we have the victory and that
[1:15:37] victory is in the name of jesus christ
[1:15:43] i mean we are worshiping we are pouring
[1:15:45] our heart up to god
[1:15:53] praise the lord
[1:15:58] one of the group of of people to have
[1:16:00] one of i mean uh one of uh uh uh you
[1:16:04] have you ever been around a uh uh a
[1:16:07] catholic i went to i went to a catholic
[1:16:09] school you know a little bit and uh uh i
[1:16:12] mean you have you ever been around those
[1:16:14] people and you hear you know their music
[1:16:16] and they are singing it's so you know
[1:16:19] it's it just looked like i mean it's
[1:16:22] just so so peaceful
[1:16:25] but none of that is a worship to god
[1:16:31] they can go
[1:16:33] none of that is a worship to god
[1:16:36] the bunch of it is spirituality
[1:16:54] praise the lord
[1:17:03] so like paul expressed here
[1:17:06] i just want to come back to this uh
[1:17:09] uh
[1:17:12] just want to come back to this uh
[1:17:16] verse here where he talks about
[1:17:21] ye are the temple of the of the living
[1:17:23] god
[1:17:24] praise the lord
[1:17:27] amen
[1:17:30] for year the temple of the living god
[1:17:33] as god hath said
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] as god have said
[1:17:41] what big god said
[1:17:43] he do or not in temple made with hints
[1:17:46] but a body
[1:17:50] that's why the apostles were referring
[1:17:51] to you ye are the temple of the living
[1:17:54] god as god have said
[1:17:58] he does not in temple me with hands
[1:18:02] but a body
[1:18:05] would there prepare me
[1:18:10] he says our dwarf in them
[1:18:14] and walk in them
[1:18:16] praise the lord
[1:18:18] now brother bannon referred to that in
[1:18:20] in in statute of the peppermint where he
[1:18:23] talks about a living monument
[1:18:27] amen he talks about a living monument
[1:18:29] when he was talking about the you know
[1:18:31] the living god dwelling in his people
[1:18:35] so you realize that he says i will
[1:18:37] endure it in them and i will walk in
[1:18:40] them it means that this temple of the
[1:18:43] living god was
[1:18:44] it was not going to be a place
[1:18:47] that would just have a stationary
[1:18:49] location
[1:18:52] praise the lord
[1:18:53] no it when it would not be a place that
[1:18:55] would have 6900 humble avenue brooklyn
[1:18:59] center and it would just be in that
[1:19:01] corner no it was going to be a place
[1:19:04] that was going to be wherever you go
[1:19:05] wherever you are
[1:19:07] he warned you to be his temple
[1:19:10] he want to have sacrifice must be there
[1:19:14] worship must be there
[1:19:24] i will live in them
[1:19:27] i will walk in them
[1:19:30] and i will be their god
[1:19:34] and they shall be my people
[1:19:38] praise the lord
[1:19:42] praise the lord
[1:19:45] just remember
[1:19:48] if there is no sacrifice
[1:19:52] it's not a temple
[1:19:55] there will be no worship
[1:19:57] if there is no sacrifice
[1:20:05] there will be no worship
[1:20:14] praise the lord amen
[1:20:17] have a bunch of men that have studied
[1:20:20] the message over the years
[1:20:23] yes
[1:20:24] and all the cults
[1:20:26] and they know everything until they have
[1:20:28] gone to research
[1:20:30] and they know uh
[1:20:32] everything
[1:20:34] even when for public documents
[1:20:37] to prove what what brother branham said
[1:20:39] is right or wrong
[1:20:41] that's just argument there is no
[1:20:43] sacrifice in that
[1:20:59] and we have become
[1:21:01] the synagogues of satan
[1:21:04] praise the lord
[1:21:08] that are now polluting the minds of
[1:21:10] young people
[1:21:11] and older
[1:21:12] people no one are we having divorce
[1:21:16] crisis
[1:21:17] young people define themselves
[1:21:27] because that's what happened
[1:21:29] in the synagos of satan
[1:21:36] praise the lord
[1:21:42] that's what happened in the synagogues
[1:21:44] of satan
[1:21:53] praise the lord
[1:22:01] and all of these things when you think
[1:22:02] about it
[1:22:05] you know just like
[1:22:07] we were sharing with you the bible says
[1:22:09] without blood there is no remission it
[1:22:11] all comes back to sacrifice
[1:22:14] and uh uh
[1:22:16] you know that's that's the reason why
[1:22:19] uh you and you you know god in his great
[1:22:22] knowledge designed it that way
[1:22:24] knowing that uh
[1:22:27] he was going to move and start dealing
[1:22:29] with the gentiles he had
[1:22:32] you know
[1:22:33] the old testament tabernacle
[1:22:36] sacrificed to cease
[1:22:39] praise the lord
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:42] now if you go back to daniel
[1:22:46] and you read
[1:22:47] about daniel prophecy
[1:22:51] at the 70 weeks of
[1:22:54] the lord revealed to daniel how
[1:22:57] worship will come back
[1:23:00] how they are going to go back
[1:23:02] to
[1:23:03] the sacrifice the temple worship and all
[1:23:06] of that because that that that is the
[1:23:08] way that uh the people of israel will be
[1:23:12] presented back to god
[1:23:18] are we together
[1:23:21] because now they don't have they don't
[1:23:23] have no no temple washing
[1:23:28] i mean they can sit in their different
[1:23:30] places and you know and read the torah
[1:23:33] you know and read the psalm of david and
[1:23:35] read the words of moses and read all of
[1:23:37] that
[1:23:40] and uh you know uh uh and educate
[1:23:43] himself in in the prophet but you see
[1:23:45] that's that's god's design that's the
[1:23:47] way he designed it
[1:23:57] but just like i said we will share some
[1:23:59] of those things with you when we go in
[1:24:00] depth with this but what i wanted to
[1:24:03] just draw our mind to tonight
[1:24:06] is that we have to realize
[1:24:11] that
[1:24:12] our redemption
[1:24:14] the reason why we are called
[1:24:17] you know
[1:24:18] now so you you see here when paul was
[1:24:20] talking to the corinthian church
[1:24:24] from verse 11 he says oh yeah corinthian
[1:24:26] our mouth is open unto you
[1:24:30] our heart is enlarged
[1:24:32] and he's talking to them about all of
[1:24:34] this knowing that right there was there
[1:24:37] was the the the temple of diana and and
[1:24:41] all of the other worship and and you
[1:24:43] know and all of those things that they
[1:24:45] were involved in
[1:24:46] you're trying to bring those uh
[1:24:48] uh corinthians believers to the place to
[1:24:51] realize that god when he uh redeemed us
[1:24:55] and called us there is no way we can
[1:24:57] find ourselves back into the traditions
[1:24:59] of the world or the traditions of our
[1:25:02] tribe or the traditions of our country
[1:25:04] and uh trying to make them to realize
[1:25:07] that i mean there is there is one
[1:25:09] sacrifice that god has raised up that is
[1:25:11] the lord jesus christ
[1:25:15] praise the lord
[1:25:20] are we together
[1:25:24] so on this on this prayer meeting night
[1:25:26] tonight
[1:25:28] that is what i want for us to meditate
[1:25:30] on a little bit
[1:25:33] for us to meditate on
[1:25:36] we have to realize
[1:25:38] that this is a spirit
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:43] just like i said
[1:25:46] these
[1:25:48] guys that call themselves jews creep
[1:25:50] into the church
[1:25:53] amen
[1:25:54] and they were the one that was trying to
[1:25:56] force the gentiles to to come honor the
[1:25:58] lord
[1:26:02] praise the lord that's right
[1:26:04] they were trying to they were trying to
[1:26:06] bring back again uh uh the leviticus
[1:26:09] other than and this is the way it is
[1:26:11] supposed to be done and all of these
[1:26:12] gentile men you know uh uh that they
[1:26:15] have to be second size and you know they
[1:26:17] gotta get away from from eating strange
[1:26:19] thing you know in all of these strange
[1:26:22] ideas to be able to produce
[1:26:26] a self-righteous holiness
[1:26:32] accept righteous holiness
[1:26:36] praise the lord
[1:26:38] you see the thing about it there is that
[1:26:40] uh you can you can take everything from
[1:26:42] the word and everything you know the the
[1:26:44] you know the prophet said the message
[1:26:46] said we must not do this the message
[1:26:48] said the prophet said the scripture said
[1:26:50] you can line up all of those things
[1:26:54] but if it's not producing
[1:26:58] a sacrificial life
[1:27:01] praise the lord
[1:27:05] if all of those things and it's not
[1:27:07] making your heart
[1:27:09] a true of mercy
[1:27:12] if all of those things are not burdening
[1:27:15] you and putting you on your knees to cry
[1:27:18] for lost souls
[1:27:22] i just want to make you self-righteous i
[1:27:24] mean the message i'm going i'm going in
[1:27:26] the rapture i see all of those
[1:27:28] unbelievers separate see if that's what
[1:27:30] is making you
[1:27:33] praise the lord
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:39] that i'm afraid
[1:27:41] that we still have men in this age
[1:27:44] that are synagogues of satan
[1:27:53] i'm afraid that we still have men
[1:27:56] because it's a spirit
[1:27:58] that came from one edge
[1:28:00] to the next age
[1:28:06] and that's the reason why in this age is
[1:28:08] going to produce
[1:28:10] it did produce the man of sin
[1:28:13] i have exalted himself above that which
[1:28:16] is called god
[1:28:18] yes
[1:28:25] i praise the lord
[1:28:34] that's what i want for us to meditate
[1:28:36] upon tonight
[1:28:40] that's what i want for us to get because
[1:28:42] that's what we are called to
[1:28:45] to be the temple
[1:28:47] of the living god
[1:28:49] there must be blood
[1:28:51] upon our heart the bleeding word
[1:28:55] as we go every day there must be blood
[1:28:57] there must be fresh sacrifice on our
[1:28:59] heart
[1:29:03] interceding for the lost
[1:29:08] the bible says that was the work of the
[1:29:10] priest to to make sacrifice for himself
[1:29:13] and sacrifice for the people
[1:29:19] if this is the temple of the living god
[1:29:21] where god says i will dwell in you and i
[1:29:24] will walk in you
[1:29:27] then i must go dearly every day
[1:29:32] with a fresh sacrifice
[1:29:34] on my heart
[1:29:39] praise the lord
[1:29:46] interceding for the lost
[1:29:48] having a heart to be able to help a
[1:29:52] falling brother
[1:29:53] a weak sister not taking advantage of
[1:29:56] someone weakness
[1:30:07] man when we get in this you you realize
[1:30:09] that
[1:30:14] the roman system
[1:30:18] has influenced
[1:30:20] i've just listened to the prophet of god
[1:30:22] today
[1:30:23] and he says that
[1:30:25] if time lasts he was talking from from
[1:30:27] the time he preached that message key to
[1:30:28] the door
[1:30:30] he says the pentecostal church will be
[1:30:31] worse than the catholic church and i
[1:30:33] believe we we
[1:30:34] at that time
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:50] praise the lord
[1:30:54] i thought i should share that with you
[1:30:55] after
[1:30:56] a time of pray

[1:34:50] he was going to bring us out of uh
[1:34:52] adulterous life he was going to bring us
[1:34:54] out of uh you know god set the scene of
[1:34:58] of the background of these people that
[1:35:00] he's going to use as the tabernacle
[1:35:04] of the living god
[1:35:14] a place
[1:35:17] where he would make sacrifice
[1:35:19] a place where he would bring praise
[1:35:23] and worship
[1:35:28] the lord i mean if you can't sacrifice
[1:35:30] to clap your hands
[1:35:31] how can you worship the lord
[1:35:36] if you can even make the least sacrifice
[1:35:38] to sink
[1:35:40] out of your heart meditating on those
[1:35:42] words how are you worshiping the lord
[1:35:45] you see we tried we try to to design and
[1:35:49] bring god's through our kind of mind and

[1:36:11] when he took that sharp rock
[1:36:15] and that little line bleeding and
[1:36:18] fighting all over the place it was not a
[1:36:20] pretty thing

[1:36:30] pleased with
[1:36:31] yes

[1:37:38] you can make choices of how you want it
[1:37:40] to be
[1:37:43] but when your heart is in it
[1:37:47] to be able to give your all

[1:47:19] we are supposed to be people that are
[1:47:21] very serviceable
[1:47:23] children got to be serviceable to your

[1:47:49] have washed your feet i have saved you
[1:47:52] i have been a seven to you
[1:47:58] that's the reason why there was no cheer
[1:48:00] in the tabernacle
[1:48:02] because the people owner went there to
[1:48:04] self
[1:48:05] they never went there to sit down cross
[1:48:07] their legs

[1:48:13] we wouldn't want to be safe
[1:48:15] we wouldn't want to be taken care of
[1:48:18] what is the service that we bring into
[1:48:20] the lord
[1:48:22] as we save god's people
