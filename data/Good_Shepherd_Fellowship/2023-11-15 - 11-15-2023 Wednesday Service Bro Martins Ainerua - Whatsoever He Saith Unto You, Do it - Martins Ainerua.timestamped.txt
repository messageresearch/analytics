[19:27] right into to our prayer meeting before
[19:30] we change the order of the
[19:33] service praise the Lord amen let's read
[19:36] from Luke Chapter
[19:40] 5 this a scripture cut my attention
[19:44] tonight Luke Chapter
[19:53] 5
[19:57] savior
[19:58] [Music]
[20:02] savior you're my
[20:05] heart oh
[20:10] cist Luke Chapter 5 we read from verse
[20:18] [Music]
[20:24] 27 Luke 5 reading from verse 27
[20:28] and after these things he went forth
[20:32] speaking about
[20:34] Jesus and saw a
[20:37] Publican Nam
[20:40] Levi sitting at the receip of custom and
[20:45] he said unto him follow
[20:49] me and he left all rose up and follow
[20:55] him and Levi made him a great
[20:59] feast at his own
[21:02] house and there was a great company of
[21:06] [Music]
[21:08] publicans and of others that sat down
[21:11] with
[21:15] him but the scribes and Pharisees murmur
[21:19] against his disciples saying why do ye
[21:23] eat and drink with publicans and
[21:27] sinners
[21:28] and
[21:30] Jesus answering said unto
[21:33] them they that are whole need not a
[21:38] physician but they that are
[21:42] sick I came not to call the
[21:45] righteous but Sinners to
[21:49] repentance amen amen now before we pray
[21:54] [Music]
[21:56] tonight if you read this account over in
[21:59] the Book of Matthew chapter
[22:02] 9 Matthew testify of
[22:06] himself but he did not give the account
[22:10] in the way that is given he testified
[22:13] and said how Jesus called
[22:16] him into the ministry or called him to
[22:19] be a disciple he said follow thou me and
[22:22] he said
[22:23] follow but when Luke testified of the
[22:28] same account he gave us a
[22:30] background that M you was a
[22:34] Publican so which mean he was
[22:37] not part of the religious group he was
[22:40] not a Pharisees a Publican means an
[22:44] unbeliever so Luke gave us this account
[22:47] that Matthew was an unbeliever working
[22:50] for the Roman
[22:53] government doing his custom work and
[22:56] Jesus call him and when he received this
[23:01] C he
[23:03] decided to bring Jesus
[23:05] home and have a feast and invite invite
[23:10] his friends if he was not a religious
[23:13] guide his friends would be unbelievers
[23:15] so he invited a bunch of publicans
[23:19] over and there also some scribes and
[23:22] Pharisees show up at the at the
[23:26] feast and now they are
[23:29] confused why is Jesus and his disciple
[23:32] hanging out with bunch of publicans and
[23:35] Sinners and Jesus said this since Sunday
[23:40] this this thought has been on my
[23:43] mind and it actually led me to to look
[23:46] at the
[23:49] scripture Jesus said they that are whole
[23:52] need not a physician but they that are
[23:56] sick and and I I came to realize or I I
[23:59] started thinking about it all through
[24:01] the
[24:03] [Music]
[24:04] week that it was because of a need for a
[24:08] [Music]
[24:10] savior that was the reason why God gave
[24:13] us
[24:14] one praise the Lord and listen to me
[24:17] carefully tonight I I don't know if it
[24:20] will be real to you like it it came real
[24:23] to
[24:24] me and until we have the need
[24:29] many of us grow up around church we grow
[24:32] up
[24:33] around the message of the hour we've
[24:36] been hearing it so sometimes it's hard
[24:40] for us to see the area of our
[24:43] need but until that need is
[24:47] identified that area of need in our life
[24:51] because that's what the Savior was given
[24:53] for that is the only way he can feel
[24:56] that need until we can be able to
[24:59] identify that we have a
[25:01] [Music]
[25:04] need praise the
[25:08] Lord there was a situation in
[25:12] Eden and that's what God provided a
[25:14] [Music]
[25:20] lamb and I believe that's when salvation
[25:23] become real to
[25:25] you when you have identified your need
[25:28] for a
[25:29] savior some people need Church some
[25:32] people need the
[25:36] preacher and we can have all of
[25:39] that like Jesus said it's only them that
[25:42] are sick that need a
[25:45] physician praise the Lord and I want for
[25:49] us to do that
[25:50] tonight I
[25:52] know many of us we are safe we love the
[25:56] Lord
[25:59] [Music]
[26:00] but may God give us a need for him
[26:04] tonight and I believe it's a need for
[26:08] more of God that have drawn us to the
[26:10] house of God tonight not just to be
[26:13] identified with a Wednesday
[26:15] service and I sure there are some that
[26:18] would love to be here tonight but as we
[26:21] go to God in prayer tonight let's play I
[26:24] need thee Oh I need
[26:26] thee
[26:37] [Music]
[26:43] if you love to sit whichever comfortable
[26:46] position that is good for
[26:49] you let's just bow our heads tonight as
[26:52] we will go to the Lord in
[26:54] [Music]

[47:58] 2
[48:00] The Gospel According to Brother John
[48:03] Chapter 2 we are reading the first five
[48:09] verses it's always good to carry our
[48:11] bies when coming to church some of you
[48:14] are fing hands looking at my face it's
[48:17] not the
[48:20] best okay five verses praise God Amen
[48:24] all right goes like this at the third
[48:28] day there was a marriage in Canon of
[48:31] Galilee and the mother of Jesus was
[48:34] there and both Jesus was called and his
[48:37] disciples to the marriage and when they
[48:40] wanted wine the mother of Jesus said
[48:43] unto him they have no
[48:47] wine Jesus said unto her woman what have
[48:52] I to do with thee my hour
[48:56] is not yet
[48:58] kind his mother sath unto the
[49:01] servants whatsoever he saith unto
[49:06] you do
[49:08] it may the Lord bless the portion of
[49:11] that Bible into our hearts you can
[49:14] please be
[49:16] seated you know sometimes you know
[49:20] sometimes we don't like correction we
[49:22] don't like to be corrected and may I say
[49:26] something about it the Bible say all
[49:30] scriptures is given by inspiration of
[49:34] God and is
[49:36] profitable for
[49:38] doy for Repro for correction for
[49:43] instruction orto righteousness so that
[49:46] the man of God the woman of God the boy
[49:50] of God the girl of God might be perfect
[49:54] thoroughly for
[49:56] unto all good
[49:58] works amen know the Bible teaches us
[50:01] that like in in our children the Bible
[50:04] say foolishness is in the heart of the
[50:07] children he said it take the road of
[50:09] Correction to drive it out that's what
[50:13] the Bible says God want us to correct
[50:16] our children where they are wrong are we
[50:19] are God children when we are wrong in
[50:21] anything it is God responsibility to
[50:24] correct us
[50:26] and the Bible tells us anyway that no
[50:30] correction is you know is joyous when
[50:33] you know he said but they that we
[50:36] believe it and exercise themselves in
[50:39] it they shall be blessed so when God
[50:43] bring correction don't be
[50:45] offended because he doesn't want us to
[50:48] perish with the word am God bless you
[50:52] amen so from the scripture we have read
[50:57] before we start preaching let us just
[50:59] have a word of prayer you know sometimes

[51:05] just flowing with certain things that

[52:40] God bless
[52:42] you yeah tonight I just want to pass a
[52:45] few comment
[52:48] on on I think verse four or that we
[52:53] read that was Mary you know I've said it
[52:57] before or suay I remember I said it that
[53:00] Mary in the actual sex was not the
[53:02] mother of Jesus Christ which I know we
[53:05] all know was she was just an
[53:08] incubator we know that there are some
[53:11] places where the Bible talk about mother
[53:14] you know it was the disciple putting
[53:16] those things down at that time they have
[53:19] not got a full revelation of what are
[53:22] all
[53:24] about
[53:27] when they were invited to that marriage
[53:30] they
[53:32] went why they were there the Bible says
[53:36] their wine God
[53:40] finished
[53:42] and Mary got to know that they needed
[53:47] wine Mary be the
[53:50] incubator knowing very well
[53:54] that
[53:56] it was not man and woman living together
[53:59] that brought Jesus to this life she knew
[54:02] that that child was a supernatural
[54:05] person she knows because it was a given
[54:10] birth to Jesus that broke our virginity
[54:12] bear with me you know I'm preaching not
[54:14] that I want to be mean he knows she if
[54:17] nobody else knows she
[54:20] knows that is why she now appealed to
[54:23] Jesus these people have a need here is
[54:26] is marriage you can see the crowd that
[54:30] are
[54:31] gathered they don't have wine Jesus said
[54:35] woman you can never find one place in
[54:38] the Bible where Jesus called Mary
[54:41] Mother any time Jesus talk about Mary he
[54:45] addressed her as woman of course that's
[54:48] is what she was to
[54:53] him the people don't have one and Jesus
[54:56] said woman what have I to do with you my
[55:00] time has not yet
[55:05] come Mary knowing very well that you can
[55:09] never sincerely put a request before
[55:13] Jesus without him answering you
[55:18] yes I think we all have testimony about
[55:21] that God answers prayers amen that is
[55:25] the word say whatsoever thing you desire
[55:28] amen when you ask in prayer believe you
[55:31] receive it and you shall have
[55:34] it amen amen now when that happened Mary
[55:40] now he may did care the way Jesus answer
[55:45] her he knows that he have presented the
[55:48] request and the answer will
[55:50] come many went to the servant he said
[55:53] did you see the man I went to talk to
[55:56] they say yes say whatever he says or to
[56:01] you do
[56:03] it see whaty was saying in is that that
[56:07] man may come up to say something that
[56:09] doesn't look reasonable to human being
[56:13] yes but as long as is the one who said
[56:16] it do it oh my just do
[56:22] it now Jesus did not get up from where
[56:25] he
[56:26] was now that he did Pray when the time
[56:30] finally came he said feel the water pots
[56:34] with
[56:37] water is why we need our ts are
[56:41] flowing he could have told him that

[57:50] amen now they they draw the water and we
[57:55] to give to the governor the governor

[58:03] me the
[58:04] bridegroom when the bridegroom came said
[58:07] ah every man at the beginning of the
[58:10] feast used to set up good wine when the
[58:14] people are well
[58:17] drunk then that which is bad because
[58:20] they are under the now they can drink
[58:23] anything he said but you have reserved

[58:31] group he didn't know what was happening
[58:34] it's only the servants that knew and the
[58:37] bible say that was the first miracle
[58:40] that Jesus
[58:41] performs praise be to God Amen this
[58:45] Jesus we are talking about is the same
[58:48] yesterday yes today and forever when ABR
[58:52] preach a message he said cast all your
[58:54] your cares not some all your cares upon
[58:59] Him for he car for
[59:01] you that is why I so much believe so
[59:05] much that until truly God is finished
[59:08] with you as his child no sickness can
[59:12] take you is the Lord that God that
[59:15] healed all our
[59:18] diseases the Bible say he was wounded

[59:25] our iniquities the of our peace was upon
[59:28] him by his we were healed there's no
[59:33] sickness that God cannot heal there is
[59:36] no incurable disease before our
[59:40] God Amen if you see any of his children
[59:44] die die by any sickness not because God
[59:48] could heal because he have an appointed
[59:51] time for every one of us amen he's a
[59:55] great physician yes amen amen yes oh man

[1:00:40] does thou art does thou shall
[1:00:44] return some people or learning that
[1:00:48] wrestle with scriptures for their own
[1:00:51] condemnation they say what are you
[1:00:53] saying all beings are dust they to dust
[1:00:57] period they don't have the revelation of
[1:00:59] what that word is said the prophet said
[1:01:02] that was spok of the body yes it's not
[1:01:04] the
[1:01:05] soul
[1:01:08] amen my father in before he finally gave
[1:01:12] his life to Christ he was having a
[1:01:15] problem in the scripture where Jesus
[1:01:17] said they that
[1:01:19] have they will have abundantly and they
[1:01:23] that don't have the to that he
[1:01:26] have we be taken from them he said
[1:01:31] what how can you so say that but
[1:01:35] he may God help us you see this
[1:01:40] Bible is God IR written form am amen
[1:01:46] scientifically you can never understand
[1:01:48] it right that is why you need as a man
[1:01:53] you need as a woman a boy as a girl to
[1:01:55] be born again so when you are born again
[1:01:59] the spirit that wrot this Bible now
[1:02:01] dwelling in you you can now understand
[1:02:04] the
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:06] Bible amen amen that was his problem
[1:02:09] until he gave his life to Christ praise
[1:02:13] God Amen what are we saying
[1:02:18] tonight when that happened the old place
[1:02:22] the especially the
[1:02:24] who knew what they did it was water they
[1:02:27] f with and the governor gave that type
[1:02:32] of a
[1:02:36] remark they knew right from that time
[1:02:39] that that man was not an ordinary man
[1:02:43] yes today Jes people call Jesus a second
[1:02:47] person in
[1:02:49] Trinity from Genesis to Revelation the
[1:02:52] word Trinity is not in the Bible M it is
[1:02:56] just a word that was invented about the
[1:02:58] false
[1:02:59] denomination that the daughters carried
[1:03:04] overboard we all know the first
[1:03:06] denomination we know it yeah we know it
[1:03:11] but God has promised his children yes
[1:03:15] you shall know the
[1:03:17] truth and the truth will do what set you
[1:03:20] free we have been set free from
[1:03:23] denominationalism
[1:03:25] we have been set free from easing we
[1:03:27] have been set free from all theological
[1:03:29] teachings yes yes
[1:03:34] after the apostles were with Jesus
[1:03:36] remember he was the one who called them
[1:03:38] after he has called them and they were
[1:03:40] with him for 3 years and 6
[1:03:42] months when he was to go he
[1:03:45] recommended uh uh the Jerusalem for them
[1:03:50] to stay and wait until they be endued
[1:03:53] with power
[1:03:54] from on high yes what the blood of Anima
[1:03:58] could not do is that it was blood of
[1:04:01] animal and the life that was in the
[1:04:03] blood of animal was animal life yes we
[1:04:06] said it on suay couldn't come upon the
[1:04:09] worshiper but when God became
[1:04:13] flesh it was just for one
[1:04:16] purpose that one purpose was for you and
[1:04:20] me to be manifested Amen period that's
[1:04:24] why Jesus said greater love and no man
[1:04:27] than this that a man love his friends
[1:04:30] and he gave his life to them amen that
[1:04:33] is why we are what we are
[1:04:35] today we are a product of Grace yes sing
[1:04:40] grace of God Amen thank you that is why
[1:04:43] no matter what you see no matter how bad
[1:04:45] somebody is your children are not they
[1:04:48] stubble don't don't do contrary just go
[1:04:52] on your knees for them you will like
[1:04:54] them before God met you

[1:05:00] come short of the glory of God all means
[1:05:04] all all sin you read Ephesians 2 only
[1:05:08] the time will not permit us to be

[1:06:03] kinds of rubbish and Alles but God who
[1:06:07] has predestinated you and me who reach
[1:06:11] came across our path the day you gave
[1:06:15] your life to
[1:06:16] Christ there were many that came to the
[1:06:18] service after the service the man was
[1:06:21] talking don't mind him
[1:06:24] yeah oh yeah it depends on where you
[1:06:27] come
[1:06:28] from
[1:06:30] Judas brother Abraham said the apost
[1:06:33] apostleship of Judas was not inferior to
[1:06:36] that of
[1:06:38] Peter the way God
[1:06:41] Wass he knew very well that this man is
[1:06:43] a
[1:06:44] thief he make him the treasurer of the
[1:06:49] church the day that woman came I use
[1:06:53] that Cly H what do you call you per to
[1:06:56] per his body which Jesus said
[1:06:58] was he was anointed for that for the
[1:07:01] burrier yes it was only Judas who
[1:07:06] protested said this things should have
[1:07:09] be sold for 300 P have be given to the
[1:07:12] poor the Bible say not because he came
[1:07:14] for the poor because he was a thief
[1:07:17] every money that comes to his SP
[1:07:20] brotherr said not that Jas actually
[1:07:23] wanted to
[1:07:24] Ser Jesus because of his love of money
[1:07:28] that made him to do that thing because
[1:07:30] several times Jesus they wanted to
[1:07:33] arrest him he just passed the People by
[1:07:35] there was a time they they L him you
[1:07:38] know at the brim of a mountain so that
[1:07:41] they could push him down he just passed
[1:07:43] them he didn't know that his time was
[1:07:46] not
[1:07:48] yet that is why look my pocket looks to
[1:07:52] be getting dry let me go make covenant
[1:07:56] with the denominations and S him and I
[1:08:00] will warn them it be my Escape there the
[1:08:03] money is not
[1:08:06] affordable so he made that Covenant of
[1:08:09] 30 pieces of
[1:08:11] silver and he came to the G and he said
[1:08:15] look Jesus was just you know uh you
[1:08:19] can't differentiate him from his
[1:08:21] disciples he has to take Judas by a king
[1:08:24] to identify him to the men he
[1:08:26] s say look this Covenant I enter to with
[1:08:31] the money is not affordable it the man
[1:08:34] Escape because he was very sure that
[1:08:36] Jesus will
[1:08:38] escape if you look at the way Jesus used
[1:08:40] to escape he doesn't
[1:08:42] run not that he run they couldn't find
[1:08:45] him no he just passed them by his time
[1:08:49] was not yet nobody could lay hands on
[1:08:51] him if he didn't give himself up
[1:08:54] who can
[1:08:56] God who is he a m can this a carpenter
[1:09:02] the that put it together like this have
[1:09:05] ability with a hammer to Pieces it and
[1:09:08] make fire with it yeah that was the
[1:09:12] almighty God you know where they came to
[1:09:14] the Garden they he say what are you
[1:09:16] looking for say Jesus of nazare say I'm
[1:09:19] the one the Bible say they all went
[1:09:21] backward and fell down
[1:09:24] it was because his time has when Judah
[1:09:27] must have seen that they
[1:09:31] all I said him before he's going to
[1:09:34] escape but he did Escape when he saw
[1:09:37] that he was arrested they were M him he
[1:09:40] were doing all kinds of thing
[1:09:43] condemnation came to his heart I betray
[1:09:46] innocent
[1:09:47] blood he repented it is one thing to
[1:09:51] repent after repentance they used to be
[1:09:54] in need of
[1:09:56] restitution when he repented he made
[1:09:58] restitution he spent out of that money
[1:10:00] he brought him back to the temple he
[1:10:03] said I betray but they say what are you
[1:10:06] talking what concerns us see you to him
[1:10:09] he went out after
[1:10:12] repentance you should believe that God
[1:10:15] has accepted your repentance and he has
[1:10:17] forgiv you but instead of that he went
[1:10:20] and committed
[1:10:22] suicide
[1:10:25] you see Peter did the same thing similar
[1:10:29] thing he only didn't make covenant he
[1:10:30] didn't take
[1:10:31] money when he was telling Jesus Jesus
[1:10:34] was telling what was going to happen to
[1:10:37] him Peter said what said I we die with
[1:10:41] you if everybody go I will go he was
[1:10:44] boting in the flesh yes yes look as
[1:10:50] Christians the only Power we have is the
[1:10:53] Holy Ghost amen are you following me the
[1:10:56] only Power we have is the holy
[1:11:00] ghost that is why we don't put Trust In
[1:11:03] the Flesh we trust him he that has saved
[1:11:07] us f
[1:11:08] with promise he will never leave us nor
[1:11:11] forsake us we trust him even hard
[1:11:14] situations you are faced with some
[1:11:16] situation don't know the way out that's
[1:11:18] why you go your KN and commit yourself
[1:11:20] to him he will said no matter situation
[1:11:24] you are fa he said if you are honest and
[1:11:26] you are sincere he said God has a way of
[1:11:30] revealing his will to you about that
[1:11:32] matter oh
[1:11:35] sure so we find that uh he went and
[1:11:40] committed sde it was pet that was say I
[1:11:43] will die with if everybody go will go
[1:11:46] Jesus said you mean it he say yes Jesus
[1:11:50] know very well he was boasting in the
[1:11:52] flesh
[1:11:55] he said before will Crow you would
[1:11:57] have denied me three
[1:11:59] times said me deny you okay when they
[1:12:05] came to arrest
[1:12:06] Jesus Peter stay a away was following
[1:12:10] them so it doesn't miss the way they
[1:12:13] took Jesus but he quite a distance so
[1:12:17] see that at least he can see the way
[1:12:19] they
[1:12:20] pass finally when when they put him
[1:12:24] where they put him and the made fire it
[1:12:27] was very cold he also come to warm
[1:12:30] himself somebody look at him and said
[1:12:34] you look as if you were one of them
[1:12:35] Peter said me one of them there's
[1:12:39] nothing like that I don't know what we
[1:12:40] are talking
[1:12:41] about a small girl came he said we saw
[1:12:44] you in the garden with him he swear he
[1:12:47] it's not
[1:12:50] me at the third time
[1:12:54] the eye of Jesus had himself
[1:12:58] met have I not told
[1:13:01] you he went outside he went
[1:13:05] bitterly did he go commit
[1:13:08] suicide why did it go commit suicide he
[1:13:11] was a seed of
[1:13:14] God Jesus is not come to die for S seed
[1:13:19] they cannot be
[1:13:22] converted are you following me amen that
[1:13:25] is why he keeps say my sheep my sheep my
[1:13:28] sheep hear my voice they hear it they
[1:13:31] follow me he said the voice of strangers
[1:13:33] we they not listen
[1:13:35] to if you look at the way Jesus
[1:13:38] described you and me sheep bring it to
[1:13:41] the Natural you see how gentle sheep are
[1:13:45] not only gentle in most cases you find a
[1:13:48] group of them of course you can't see
[1:13:50] that in America anyway like you areas in
[1:13:54] Africa you find a group of them walking
[1:13:56] together in a sun where sun is shining
[1:13:59] you find that the group together
[1:14:01] together like this many of them the
[1:14:03] prophet said they are shading one
[1:14:05] another from the Sun am
[1:14:08] amen that is why we as Christians we
[1:14:11] don't fight each other we don't hate
[1:14:14] each other we don't take evil talk evil
[1:14:16] about each other we love one another
[1:14:19] because we are members of the same
[1:14:21] family as God love us we also love each
[1:14:26] other and when Jesus was finally talking
[1:14:29] about separating sheep from goat have
[1:14:32] you ever seen
[1:14:34] goat the nature of goat is
[1:14:38] terrible very
[1:14:40] stubborn
[1:14:42] good goat is coming to eat your
[1:14:44] something here you eat it with a sck
[1:14:48] sometimes he say when he's great he's
[1:14:51] watching you at the back as turning back
[1:14:54] is right
[1:14:55] there very St
[1:14:57] thing God bless you church amen now we
[1:15:02] find out that this Judas now the Bible
[1:15:06] say he has gone to his place he has a
[1:15:10] place where Jesus some people it us to
[1:15:14] stumble them she is Jesus as Jesus
[1:15:17] called Matthew has Jesus do you know the
[1:15:19] call of those disciples were
[1:15:21] Supernatural have you ever watch it some
[1:15:25] of them were with their daddy you know
[1:15:27] they were fishermen somebody just come
[1:15:30] say follow
[1:15:31] me I mean no argument no second thought
[1:15:36] they don't follow him Matthew was a
[1:15:39] custom officer you know in the office
[1:15:42] they have to they have to exchange work
[1:15:46] before he will leave your office there
[1:15:48] supposed to be another one who he
[1:15:50] replace him and then he goes when Jesus
[1:15:52] met him and say follow me whether office
[1:15:55] or no office he just follow
[1:15:58] him that was Supernatural calling that's
[1:16:02] why there's no way God can call his
[1:16:04] child and he will say he will not go no
[1:16:07] you you are helpless when he call you
[1:16:10] yes you must follow many people say then
[1:16:13] why did he call
[1:16:15] Judas the answer is not far F from the
[1:16:20] scriptures because after he called
[1:16:22] before he called you that he didn't make
[1:16:24] that statement it was after he called
[1:16:27] you that he made the statement say have
[1:16:29] I not chosen you 12 and one of you is a
[1:16:32] devil that's
[1:16:34] right then why did he chose him he
[1:16:36] because it's only Judas that can do the
[1:16:39] work of Judas Peter couldn't do it yes
[1:16:43] no Matthew no b or Philip or the rest of
[1:16:48] them it will have to take Judas to do
[1:16:50] the work of Judas amen amen
[1:16:54] that is why it Tak him to betray Jesus
[1:16:57] nobody else Jesus knew not that he was
[1:17:00] God doesn't made mistake yeah he knew
[1:17:03] that this is the one who will do the job
[1:17:05] scriptures must be fulfilled that's
[1:17:07] right oh praise the Lord amen then we
[1:17:11] find out that as they were going that
[1:17:14] very night of the Betrayal I said it on
[1:17:17] someday they were together because they
[1:17:21] prepare a place for the last oper with
[1:17:25] them he said the one that is deeping his
[1:17:28] hand with me on this spirit is the one
[1:17:31] who will betray me Peter say is he me
[1:17:33] Matthew say is he me when he come to
[1:17:37] Judah said
[1:17:38] th the man I will deep I give to his P
[1:17:41] when he de he give it to Judah when he
[1:17:43] took it the Bible say Satan took over
[1:17:45] his life when he stood up he was going
[1:17:48] to make that Covenant with the
[1:17:49] denomination Jesus said that is th doest
[1:17:54] do
[1:17:55] quickly the disciples that were sitting
[1:17:57] with it they didn't know what he was
[1:17:59] saying but Judah
[1:18:00] knew that did not stop
[1:18:03] him because he came from
[1:18:05] somewhere and he must go back to where
[1:18:09] he come
[1:18:10] from we are the people of God Amen you
[1:18:13] don't become a person of God the day you
[1:18:16] were converted it is because you are a
[1:18:18] person of God ordained by God before the
[1:18:21] foundation of the world that's why you

[1:19:28] it will be wonderful it will be glorious
[1:19:31] amen amen praise the Lord even did that
[1:19:36] payment the B stop which is the six
[1:19:40] Dimension where the Prophet was taking
[1:19:42] they didn't want to come
[1:19:44] back just that place do you
[1:19:47] know there's something I didn't me on Su
[1:19:50] I think I pass this area too
[1:19:54] said by the grace of God have been to
[1:19:55] the two places the region of the
[1:19:59] L which is
[1:20:01] down and the six
[1:20:04] Dimension which is what we can call
[1:20:07] Paradise
[1:20:09] today he said at the age of 14 when he
[1:20:13] was shot know blood was you know science
[1:20:17] has not achieved as much as they have
[1:20:19] done today so they couldn't just stop
[1:20:21] the blood the was so most breed it to
[1:20:23] death actually passed on that is why he
[1:20:26] went to that place and when he came back
[1:20:29] he told us he said that place whatever
[1:20:32] you do don't travel towards that place
[1:20:36] say you can never picture that place so
[1:20:39] bad he say it's even worse that when one
[1:20:42] is inside fire as it be but is not being
[1:20:45] consumed said never whatever you do
[1:20:48] never go towards that way how do you go
[1:20:52] towards that
[1:20:54] way he told us there are two places that
[1:20:57] the lives of human beings are INF fled
[1:21:01] from amen he said if you are a Christian
[1:21:05] your fop is
[1:21:07] up that is what influ your life that's
[1:21:11] what make you Gentle that's what make
[1:21:13] you humble that's what make you loving
[1:21:15] that's what make you forgiving that's
[1:21:17] what make because your life is being
[1:21:19] fresh from above when you see a man that
[1:21:24] is nothing he can kill he can cheat he
[1:21:28] can fight he can fuse he can qu I'm not
[1:21:31] talking about before our conversion he
[1:21:34] said he said his life is being refresh
[1:21:37] from other he said no matter how much
[1:21:39] you say my life is being fleshed from
[1:21:42] above he said what your character
[1:21:45] am because there is a power that is
[1:21:48] influencing your life in another place
[1:21:51] he was telling us he said both your
[1:21:53] actions and reactions is motivated by a
[1:21:58] spirit you know preach discernment of
[1:22:02] spirit that is why all of us he say we
[1:22:04] can't see each other he said we only see
[1:22:07] the body that car the real
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:11] you may God help us that is why nobody
[1:22:16] can M Christianity if you meet a holy
[1:22:19] ghost man he will know that you are
[1:22:21] mimicking Christianity know that's right
[1:22:23] the prophet said if you if I talk to a
[1:22:25] Man 2 minutes I will know whether I
[1:22:28] receive the holy ghost or not he said
[1:22:30] the same thing you can you can tell said
[1:22:33] because the Holy Ghost is a life amen
[1:22:36] and he went to tell us he said an elect
[1:22:40] cannot persecute an elect amen it take
[1:22:43] an evil spirit to persecute the spirit
[1:22:45] of God he doesn't like God at
[1:22:48] all whether he like God he doesn't like
[1:22:51] God we know he's beginning
[1:22:53] we know he's heading so he has no
[1:22:55] business with us God bless you am I say
[1:22:59] God bless
[1:23:00] you now we can see this statement of H
[1:23:06] Mary whatever you say do
[1:23:10] it a children of God do you know the
[1:23:14] nature of an unbeliever is a disobedient
[1:23:17] nature you can't live above your
[1:23:20] nature that is why God we said what he
[1:23:23] said whether it's in the Bible or not
[1:23:25] this is the way I want to
[1:23:27] do your will versus God's will God want
[1:23:32] it done like this you want it done like
[1:23:35] this you will follow your
[1:23:36] own Jesus said if you man slap you turn
[1:23:40] the other
[1:23:41] Chek let me tell you if you not filled
[1:23:45] with the Holy Ghost and they man slap
[1:23:47] you if you have knife you will shook him
[1:23:50] before you remember what the Bible
[1:23:53] say cuz that nature is a is a terrible
[1:23:57] nature it's a disobedient nature you
[1:24:00] remember the case of what do you call it
[1:24:03] King when God asked him where is your
[1:24:06] brother he said what did you app me to
[1:24:10] be his guide asking me of my
[1:24:13] brother they don't fear God s seed but
[1:24:17] we thank God for the seed of God that is
[1:24:20] what Jesus came to die for amen amen I
[1:24:27] am happy I can publicly announce that I
[1:24:30] am one of
[1:24:32] them I believe you canum that you are
[1:24:35] one of them because no man no man ever
[1:24:39] me Jesus I remain the same brother say
[1:24:42] what were you before you met him what
[1:24:45] are you now when you meet him there is a
[1:24:47] permanent
[1:24:49] change permanent change therefore if any
[1:24:52] being Christ is a new creation the way
[1:24:56] Jesus was born that is the line you drop
[1:25:00] into after your conversion
[1:25:03] right you know the Bible say see did my
[1:25:06] mother conceive me yes it's a permissive
[1:25:10] will this man and woman reproduces
[1:25:13] children that is why God
[1:25:18] introduced the new
[1:25:21] bir the false bir we were BN defeated
[1:25:25] nobody is good in that false bth that's
[1:25:28] why the Bible say all that are in the
[1:25:30] flesh cannot please God they can't
[1:25:33] please God you hear the denomination
[1:25:35] evil things that happen there pastors
[1:25:38] will go from Seminary to Seminary to
[1:25:41] Seminary to Seminary they can even
[1:25:43] plaster the whole world here with
[1:25:47] certificates certificate doesn't change
[1:25:51] nature the only thing that can change
[1:25:53] nature is God
[1:25:55] himself nothing else can do it praise
[1:25:58] God Amen when a man meet God oh man it's
[1:26:02] a different person all together
[1:26:06] completely some say
[1:26:09] well I believe in being a Christian but
[1:26:11] I don't believe in being
[1:26:14] foolish the prophet said until you
[1:26:17] become foolish you can't even be a
[1:26:19] Christian amen
[1:26:21] amen say you snap me say I should turn
[1:26:25] the other side am I a fool you must be a
[1:26:27] fool before you can follow
[1:26:30] God as long as you want to hold to your
[1:26:33] will you can't even follow God you just
[1:26:36] can't do
[1:26:37] it God help us but in such a way that
[1:26:41] amen as the Sheep of God God has made us
[1:26:44] in such a way that once we hear his word
[1:26:49] we say Amen to it why because the
[1:26:53] prophet said before the world
[1:26:56] began God knew us he wrote our names in
[1:27:00] the last book of
[1:27:01] life so you cannot come even emphasize
[1:27:05] it to a point to say that it is
[1:27:08] impossible for a child of God to be
[1:27:11] lost he said instead of he said if a
[1:27:15] child of God is L then God is not
[1:27:17] complete that's a very powerful
[1:27:20] statement all the of God they shall be
[1:27:23] converted
[1:27:25] am because that is what he come to Die
[1:27:29] For in John chapter 17 where Jesus will
[1:27:32] pray he said father all that you gave to
[1:27:35] me with the exception of the child of
[1:27:38] predition so that the scripture might be
[1:27:40] fulfilled I didn't lose any you say I'm
[1:27:43] no longer in the world I not saying you
[1:27:45] should take them out of the world but
[1:27:47] all I say you should do prevent them
[1:27:50] from Evil yes
[1:27:52] even if you don't know how to pray which
[1:27:54] will be be a shame you say you don't
[1:27:56] know how to pray how can you be f with
[1:27:57] the Holy Ghost you say you don't know
[1:27:59] how to pray is a shame the Bible say
[1:28:02] pray without season am you know no
[1:28:06] matter how civilized the country is I've
[1:28:08] experienced it since I came so sometime
[1:28:11] my people will call me from home the
[1:28:12] network will be misbehaving they will
[1:28:15] hear me I will hear them sometime they
[1:28:17] hear I hear them they will hear me the
[1:28:21] network that conects us to Heaven it
[1:28:23] doesn't do like that yes whether you are

[1:36:20] said Master if you have be here our
[1:36:22] brother would not have
[1:36:24] died and then Jesus said your brother
[1:36:28] will rise again he say yes remember what
[1:36:31] time you were taking us through Bible
[1:36:33] studies you remember the last day

[1:37:51] when he saw everybody cry he also was
[1:37:54] crying that is Jesus I think that's one

[1:37:59] went he said weep with those that weep
[1:38:03] and rejoice with those that he knew what
[1:38:04] he was going to do so they took him
[1:38:07] there where they bury him with Big Stone
[1:38:11] on uh that they used to seal
[1:38:14] it there something happened Jesus said
[1:38:19] father I will not have prayed this
[1:38:22] prayer if not because of those people
[1:38:23] studing here I know you have heard me
[1:38:27] for their sake I am
[1:38:30] praying after he finished
[1:38:33] prayer he said remove the
[1:38:37] stone matter the matter that said even
[1:38:40] what you ask God even now we know he
[1:38:42] will do it no Revelation what she said
[1:38:46] he said Master today is the fourth day
[1:38:50] you remove it you CA
[1:38:53] epidemic because by now it should be
[1:38:58] sticky Jesus has to preach a little
[1:39:01] Salon have I not told you that if you
[1:39:04] believe you will see the glory of God
[1:39:07] have you not heard what Mary told those
[1:39:10] servs whatever whatever he say do
[1:39:15] it when they remove the stone he said
[1:39:20] Lazarus
[1:39:22] come for a man the prophet told before
[1:39:26] they before they bury somebody he said
[1:39:28] Lazarus was Abed he told us something
[1:39:32] about abing I believe you because the
[1:39:34] prophet said it he said they have to
[1:39:36] remove the blood in P body remove water
[1:39:39] put chemical for preservation all those
[1:39:42] were done for Lazarus but the only
[1:39:46] language Jesus spoke was Lazarus come
[1:39:50] forth
[1:39:51] all the body have need of
[1:39:56] to Jesus was not a Jew he was not a was
[1:40:01] not a Samaritan je of the Old Testament
[1:40:04] is the Lord Jesus Christ of
[1:40:06] the Lazarus came up they did say rush to
[1:40:09] the testive Care Unit to test whether he
[1:40:13] has enough water in the body of blood no
[1:40:16] he was Hil and Hearty hallah do you know
[1:40:20] those
[1:40:21] people that came that have be pretending
[1:40:23] their sympathizing with Mary and
[1:40:26] M many of them were anointed they went
[1:40:29] back to their denomination to report
[1:40:32] they said this is what Jesus has done
[1:40:35] people say Jesus did that okay we will
[1:40:39] prepare and go there when we get there
[1:40:42] we know if we kill Lazarus leave Jesus
[1:40:44] alone he will raise him
[1:40:46] again when we get there we kill Lazarus
[1:40:49] we also kill Jesus
[1:40:51] see what we are
[1:40:52] saying may God help us praise God amen
[1:40:57] amen Jesus did so many things that he
[1:41:01] has no rival among religious leaders he
[1:41:04] doesn't have a rival when he was he say
[1:41:07] I have power to lay down my life and I
[1:41:10] have power to take it again amen no
[1:41:13] other man has ever spoken like that that
[1:41:15] is why When They Crucified him buried
[1:41:19] him the religious and they say let us
[1:41:23] see let you should go and watch that
[1:41:25] place so you know that deceiver said
[1:41:28] that he will raise again the third the
[1:41:31] third day so that the the second error
[1:41:34] will not be worse than the first error
[1:41:37] both the first and the second were not
[1:41:39] error they were fulfillment of
[1:41:42] scriptures they said solders to go there
[1:41:45] and
[1:41:46] watch the Sant were there watching when
[1:41:50] Jesus those
[1:41:51] again they were
[1:41:53] Witnesses they ran to go and give answer
[1:41:58] no report to those who said that they
[1:42:00] said the man rose from the dead we were

[1:42:19] say that when you were
[1:42:21] sleeping his disciples came to take his
[1:42:25] body you see lie each time you tell a
[1:42:28] lie there's a loo that will show that
[1:42:30] you were Aly if they have said when we
[1:42:32] were sleeping we don't know what
[1:42:34] happened to the body it would have be
[1:42:36] pardonable but it specifically says his
[1:42:39] disciples came to take his body can you
[1:42:42] see where you are
[1:42:44] sleeping praise God Amen the word of God
[1:42:48] is true forever settled in heaven
