TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells a story of amazing grace and jesus love she is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over but thank god at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land once more god will reveal the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficent effect of that prophet's ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22 17. the spirit and the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at nicea has come back to original word grain again praise god forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be ye separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches the spirit has spoken the setting sun is about to fade into eternity for the church ages then it will be all over then it will be too late to come but if somewhere in this series god has dealt with you by his spirit may you even now turn to him in repentance and give your life to him that by his spirit he may give you eternal life chapter 10 [Music] a resume of the ages due to the fact that our studies have been aversed by verse exposition of those scriptures that deal with the seven ages we have not set forth a continuous historical pattern of the church as much as we ought to have done it is therefore our purpose now to take this chapter and beginning with the ephesian age traced through all ages the church and her history as given to john by the spirit of god we will not be adding new material as much as correlating what we already have from our studies we have already learned that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not formally known that the church spoken of and spoken to in this book does not refer to the pure ecclesia the elect the body of christ the bride but it speaks to the entire body of people who are called christians whether they be true or merely nominal as all israel is not israel so all christians are not christians thus we learned that the church is made up of two vines the true and the false the two vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits one has the holy spirit while the other is endued with the spirit of antichrist both claim to know and be known of god both purport to speak for god both believe certain very basic truths and differ on others but since both bear the name of the lord being called christians and by such name-bearing obviously claim a relationship to him god calls it marriage god now holds them both responsible to him and therefore speaks to each we further learned that these two vines would grow side by side until the end of the ages when both would come to maturity and both be harvested the false vine would not overcome and destroy the true vine but then neither would the true vine be able to bring the false vine into a saving relationship with jesus christ we learned the most amazing truth that the holy spirit could and would fall upon the unregenerate false vine christians and manifest powerfully in various signs and wonders even as judas had a definite ministry in the holy ghost though he himself was pronounced to be a devil with these principles in mind we start to trace the church through the various seven ages the birth of the church was at pentecost as the first adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of god and was undefiled for a brief span so was christ the last adam given a bride pure and fresh at pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time and of the rest there's no man join himself to them acts 5 13 and the lord added daily such as should be saved acts 2 47 how long this continued we do not know but one day even as he was tempted and seduced by satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world first john 4 3 and jesus said concerning his bride in that first age i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent revelation 2 4-5 the church was in that first age already a fallen woman as satan had gotten to weave before adam even now had satan seduced the church the bride of christ before the marriage supper of the lamb and what specifically was in her midst that caused the fall what but revelation 2 6 the deeds of the nicolaitans already that first age had turned from following the pure word of god they turned from god's demand of a church absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon god to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government to nicolaitanism which is organizing a human government within the church which as all governments do legislate for the people they did exactly what israel did they took the expediency of human government instead of the word and the spirit death had entered how do we know do we not hear the voice of the spirit raised in that first age for all who will hear as he is calling to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life in the paradise of god the church had already imbibed too deeply of the tree of death or the denominational false vine whose end is the lake of fire but there are no cherubim with flaming swords to guard the tree of life now god does not now depart from the midst of the church as he departed from eden oh no he will ever be in the midst of his church until the final age and until that time he calls to all to come now please let us be careful here this message to the angel of the church which is at ephesus is not a message to the actual local ephesian church it is a message to the age and that age had in it the seed of truth and the seed of error exactly is set forth according to the parable of the wheat and the tares the church ages is the field and in it are wheat and tares the false church organized humanized the government and the word and fought the true christian tears always flourish mightier than wheat or any other cultivated plant the tare church grew rapidly in this first age but the wheat church was flourishing also by the end of the first age the deeds of the nicolaitans were flourishing in the local false vine churches with increasing attempts to spread their influence further than their own body its influence was felt upon the true church for men like the venerable polycarp were calling themselves bishops with a reference to that title which was not inherent in it according to the word also in that age the true church had lost its first love that love was typified as the love of bride and groom at their marriage and early years of wedded life there was a cooling of that complete love and abandonment to god but notice revelation 2 1 describes the lord jesus as in the midst of his church and holding the messengers in his right hand because this bride has fallen because the church corporate is now an admixture of true and false he does not leave it it is his and according to romans 14 7-9 that is exactly right for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living on the cross he bought the whole world of people they are his he is the lord of the living and dead as pertaining to ownership not relationship and he walks in the midst of that body that has within it life and death what was planted in the first age will develop in the second age and in all other ages until it comes to maturity and harvest thus in the smyrnian age we expect an enlargement and enlightenment of the church corporates history through a revelation of the spirit in this age the hatred of the false vine increases see they have verse 9 separated themselves from the company of the true they went out from them they were liars they called themselves what they are not but did god destroy them no let them alone and both will go to the harvest but lord they should be destroyed for they are destroying thy people they are killing them no let them alone but to my bride i say be thou faithful unto death love me even more we learn in no uncertain terms that this false vine is the vine of satan their gathering is of him satan they meet in the name of god and lie that they are christ's they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rites given by christ to the church yet they are not of god but since they say they are god will hold them responsible and in each age he speaks of them and to them they remind us exactly of balaam he had the prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto god as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the clean beasts yet he was not a true word prophet for when god told him not to go to honor balak with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by his lust for gold and prestige so god let him go the perfect will of god gave way to the permissive will of god because of the heart desire of balaam god actually said go ahead did god change his mind no sir god had his way regardless of balaam going balaam did not know the will of god god had his way regardless it was balaam who was the loser for he bypassed the word and today we have that very same thing women preachers organization false doctrine etc and people worshiping god manifesting in the spirit and going right on as did balaam claiming that god has spoken to them even when the commission received his opposite to the revealed word and i will not deny that god spoke to them but it was just like when he spoke to balaam that second time as he knew that balaam wanted his own heart desire above the word and he gave it to him yet all the while in the end having his own way even so today god tells folks to go ahead in their own hearts desires for they have already rejected the word but the will of god will be done regardless amen i hope you see this it will not only clear up much of what is seen in all ages but it will especially help in this last age which has so much manifestation and external blessings when the whole period is so against the word revealed will of god if ever an age received a message loud and clear this age did it was and is that old testament truth the son of the bond woman will distress the son of the free woman until the son of the bond woman be cast out that lets us know that the hatred and blasphemy of satan against the true christian will be vented through a group who are nominal false christians and this will increase until god uproots that false vine at the end of the laodicean age the third age revealed by the spirit of prophecy that the worldly church would adopt nicolaitanism as a doctrine the separation of the clergy from the laity grew from the biblical truth of the elders shepherds of local flocks ruling the flock by the word to the deeds of nicolaitans wherein the clergy set themselves in ranks one over the other which unscriptural formula then evolved into a priesthood that placed the clergy between man and god giving the clergy certain rights all the while denying the laity their god-given rights this was usurpation in this age it became a doctrine it was established in the church as the assured word of god which indeed it was not but the clergy called it the word of god and therefore the doctrine was antichrist because human government is politics pure and simple the church became involved in politics this involvement was welcomed by a dictator emperor who joined church politics with state politics and by force established a false church satan's false religion as the true religion and through various edicts by various emperors we find the false church with state power destroying the true vine even more avidly sad to say the true vine was not exactly immune to this doctrine by that i do not mean that the true vine ever did establish the nicolaitan ideas as a doctrine far from it but that little worm of death kept sucking at the true vine hoping that it might fall even within the true church men whom god had called as overseers were holding that title to mean a little more than just a local responsibility it was not the clear understanding of paul that existed in the church at this time for paul had said and they glorified god in me no matter what authority paul had he kept the people looking to god from whom is all authority but the clergy was always looking to divine leadership plus human and thus in giving honor where honor was not due we find that the true church was spotted with humanism with nicolaitanism established apostolic succession placed ministers pastors voted in etc it was only one step for the false church to proceed to balaamism the second step to the depth of satan was now in full progress this second step was the doctrine of balaam described in revelation 2 14 wherein balaam taught balak to stumble the children of israel by a united meeting there the guests would do two more things contrary to the word of god you will recall that balak needed help to keep his kingdom he called on the most dominant spiritual figure of his day balaam balaam gave the advice that trapped and destroyed israel it was first of all to suggest that they all get together and talk things over and eat together and get things ironed out after all understanding each other goes a long way once you accomplish that you can go from there the next step would be worshiping together and of course a little pressure from the host usually makes the guests go a lot further than they intended now that didn't only happen back there to god's church of the old testament but it happened to the church of the new testament for there was an emperor who like balak needed help to secure his kingdom so constantine invited the nominal christian first christian church of rome to help him get the christians behind him as they were a very large body the outcome was the nicene council of 325. there the christians both true and nominal came together at the invitation of constantine the true christians had no business even going up to the meeting in spite of all constantine could do to unite them all the real believers knew they were out of place and left but to those who remained constantine gave of the state's treasury along with political and physical force the people were introduced to idol worship and spiritism for statues with names of saints were placed in the buildings and the people were taught to commune with the dead or pray to saints which is nothing more or less than spiritism for the food that man truly needs even the word of god they were given creeds and dogmas and rituals which were also enforced by the state and above all they were given three gods with the triple compound name of the one true god and water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ gave way to the pagan baptism of three titles the real believers ought not to have gone there they had already lost much truth and now they too would lose the understanding of godhead and forfeit names for titles in water baptism now watch this doctrine of balaam most carefully notice above all that it is the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy to bind the people to them by leading the people deliberately into the sin of unbelief the nicolaitan doctrine was the corruption of the clergy as they sought political power amongst themselves while balaamism is the subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them now watch this carefully what was it that bound the people to the nominal church and thereby destroyed them it was the creeds and dogmas formed into church tenets it was the doctrine of the roman catholic church they were not given the true food the word they were given the food that came from idol worship babylonian paganism wrapped up in christian terminology and that very same spirit and doctrine is right amongst all protestants and it is called denomination nicolaitanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby deposing the spirit balaamism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the bible and right to this hour many of god's people are caught in the snare of denominationalism and god is crying to them come out of her my people lest ye be partakers of her sins and that you receive not her plagues you see they are ignorant but if the rapture should take place at this moment ignorance would be no court of appeal from the judgment of god for being in the wrong ranks for the clergy to organize themselves with one rank over another until they are finally headed up by a president is a manifestation of the antichrist spirit regardless of how wonderful and necessary it may seem it is nothing but human reasoning taking the place of the word and any person who is in the organized denominations is right in the midst of an antichrist system now let me say this and make it very plain i am not against the people i am against the system with a state and church union the stage has been set for the dark ages and indeed for about 1 000 years the church went into the depth of blackness knowing the depths of satan when any religious people embrace both nicolaitanism and balaamism and have the political financial and physical power to back it up there is only one direction they can go that direction is right into the jezebel doctrine now why do we say this because as we pointed out in this study of the fourth age that jezebel was a sidonian the daughter of ethbale who was king priest to astarte he was a murderer this woman married ahab king of israel for political expediency she then took over the religion of the people and murdered the levites and erected temples wherein she caused the people to worship astarte venus and bale sun god she formulated the teaching and made her priests teach it and they in turn made the people accept it there you can see exactly what the nominal church was in the dark ages they left the word of god entirely except for names and titles of godhead and a few scriptural principles they twisted what they did take out of the bible by changing its meaning their college of bishops etc wrote vast treatises their popes declared themselves infallible and said they received revelation from god and spoke as god to the people all this was taught to the priests who through fear made the people believe it to dissent was death or excommunication which might be worse than death it was now the church with the assured voice that took over and wild with power they drank the blood of the martyrs until the true christians were all but exterminated and there was hardly any word left and little manifestation of the holy ghost but the true vine struggled and survived god was faithful to the little flock and in spite of what rome might do to their bodies rome could not kill the spirit within them and the light of the truth shone on backed by the holy ghost and power this is a good place to make an illuminating observation look the deeds and doctrines of the nicolaitans the doctrine of balaam and the teaching of the false prophetess jezebel do not constitute three spirits or make three spiritual principles these three are but the various manifestations of the same spirit as it goes from depth to depth what it all is is the antichrist spirit of organization in its three various stages once the clergy separated themselves and organized themselves they oppressed the people by leading them into and binding them to organization also this organization was based upon the creeds and dogma which they taught the people instead of the pure word of god ritual and ceremony was given an increasing part in worship and soon this whole system was a militant and diabolical power that did its best to control all through the persuasion of discourse or literal force it received its energy from its own false prophecies and not the word of god it was now absolutely antichrist though it came in christ's name after what seemed an interminable time wherein truth must surely die men began to protest the vileness of the roman catholic church because by no stretch of the imagination could god be in such teaching and such conduct these protests were either disregarded and died from failure to arouse attention or were quashed by rome but then god in his sovereign grace sent a messenger by the name of martin luther to start a reformation he worked in a climate where the roman catholic church had been given so much rope that she was about to hang herself so when luther preached justification by faith the true vine for the first time in many centuries began to grow in a bountiful manner as the nominal church had used state power to back it up now state power began to flow against it and this is where luther made his mistake and the true believers made their mistake they allowed the state to subsidize them so this age did not launch out very far on the word thank god that it did go as far as it did but because it leaned on political power to a great extent this age ended in organization and this very group that in luther's generation had broken from the false vine now turned back to become a daughter of the harlot for she went right into nicolaitanism and balaamism this era had scores of factions within it and to prove how far they were from true seed is to merely read history and see how they persecuted each other even unto death in some cases but there were a few names amongst them even as there always are in every age we rejoice in this age for this one thing reformation had started it was not a resurrection but a reformation neither was it a restoration but the corn of wheat that had died at nicaea and had rotted in the dark ages now sent up a shoot of truth signifying that at some future date at the end of the laodicean age just before jesus came the church would go back to being a wheat seed bride again while the tares would be harvested and burned in the lake of fire since the fifth age had brought a great dissemination of the word through printing the sixth stage was quick to take advantage of it this age was the second stage of the restoration and as we have stated previously was the tassel age education abounded this was the age of intellectual men who loved god and served him missionaries abounded and the word spread over the world it was an age of brotherly love it was an age of the open door it was the last age of long duration and after it the laodicean age would come which would be a short one the true vine flourished in this age as in no other when one thinks of numbers at home and abroad this age brought holy men to the forefront the true vine spread and the false vine receded everywhere the true vine went god gave light and life and happiness the false vine was shown up for what it was darkness misery poverty illiteracy and death and as the false vine in its day of power could not kill the true vine neither could the true vine now bring back the false vine to jesus christ but the false vine entrenched itself waiting for the last part of the last age when it would win all back to itself except that small flock that were the elect true vine of god but how sad does this age make us feel as we realize that every great move of god and there were many neglected to throw off the nicolaitan doctrine for they all organized and died then they moved into denominations to hold the spiritually dead in foodless pastures little did they know it but each group was tainted with that same error and when the revival fire burned low organization took over and people became denominations they were only nominal christians though each group claimed with the very same assurance as the roman catholic church that they were right and all others wrong the stage was truly set for the daughters to go back home in the last age back to rome under the mother hen and so we come to the last age the laodicean age that is our age we know it is the last age for the jews are back in palestine no matter how they got there they are there and this is harvest time but before there can be a harvest there has to be a ripening a maturing of both the vines the lutheran age was the springtime the wesleyan age was the summer of growth the laodicea you
