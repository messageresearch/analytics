[1:02:21] John should not die yet Jesus said not
[1:02:26] unto him that he shall not die but you
[1:02:29] see what happened the preacher say
[1:02:32] something the people the Freeman in the
[1:02:35] level of their understanding that ah he
[1:02:38] said John is not going to die until he
[1:02:40] come in his kingdom what was they
[1:02:42] thinking about they were thinking about
[1:02:44] the Millennium but Jesus was talking
[1:02:46] about something
[1:02:47] different he was talking about another
[1:02:50] coming and that is that coming on the
[1:02:53] island of pmos
[1:02:56] praise the
[1:02:58] Lord what is it to you that he don't die
[1:03:02] until I come Jesus was talking about the
[1:03:05] coming on the island of pmos and they
[1:03:08] were thinking about the coming of the
[1:03:10] Millennium which is the the David Throne
[1:03:13] the David
[1:03:15] Reign and the Bible says the same went
[1:03:18] among the disciples and they all start
[1:03:20] making their own saying that Jesus said
[1:03:22] he will not die but Jes Jesus said not
[1:03:25] unto him he shall not die if I will that
[1:03:29] that he T till I come that he TI till I
[1:03:35] come what is there
[1:03:37] today this is the disciple which testify
[1:03:40] of these things and wrote these things
[1:03:42] and we know that his testimony is truth
[1:03:47] amen we know that his testimony is truth
[1:03:50] and the church
[1:03:52] says amen
[1:03:55] and and and and and there are also many
[1:03:58] other things that Jesus did the which if
[1:04:02] they should be written everyone I
[1:04:04] suppose that even the word itself could
[1:04:07] not contain the books there should be
[1:04:11] written amen you love the Lord tonight
[1:04:14] so we want to talk about that coming we
[1:04:17] want to talk about uh uh uh uh John
[1:04:21] fulfilling that that saying of Jesus
[1:04:24] praise the Lord fulfilling their saying
[1:04:27] of
[1:04:29] Jesus he he spoke about the end of Peter
[1:04:33] and he spoke about the end of John
[1:04:35] praise the Lord when he spoke about
[1:04:37] Peter and he says he says all will lead
[1:04:40] thee amen which mean they will lead you
[1:04:43] to crucification this man uh uh he's

[1:10:52] you see when I when I I was studying on
[1:10:54] this on the on the message uh praising
[1:10:56] of Jesus Christ I knew brother Brandon

[1:11:02] America most notorious praising you can
[1:11:06] pull that word out you see he mentioned
[1:11:07] it several places so I had that in the
[1:11:10] back of my mind and I was I was I was
[1:11:12] trying to see how I can bring that uh uh
[1:11:15] into our subject about praising them so
[1:11:18] I'm going to try to do I'm going to
[1:11:20] introduce it tonight uh uh uh so here
[1:11:23] brother Brandon now this is the picture
[1:11:26] I want you to build brother Brandon
[1:11:28] identify
[1:11:30] John as a type of every
[1:11:35] believer
[1:11:37] John is not only a type of the ones that
[1:11:41] would be alive to Rapture but he said of
[1:11:44] all the church ages the Bride of every
[1:11:47] age right John typed the Bride of every
[1:11:52] age
[1:11:54] are we together am because you have to
[1:11:57] realize that he was he he he he he was
[1:12:01] he he saw the seven golden candles
[1:12:04] STI praise the Lord The Book of
[1:12:07] Revelation starts and says the the
[1:12:10] revelation of Jesus Christ that is the
[1:12:12] coming that John experienced the coming
[1:12:16] that John experienced was the revelation
[1:12:19] of Jesus Christ that was what Jesus was
[1:12:22] talking about so there is John a type of
[1:12:25] every True Believer a type of the
[1:12:30] Bride now he's placed on uh on the
[1:12:33] island of pmos and brother Brandon now
[1:12:36] is describing this island of pmos
[1:12:39] bringing it to h h h a place a notorious
[1:12:44] place here in the US so we can have an
[1:12:47] idea of what the island of pmos
[1:12:52] was praise praise the Lord are we
[1:12:55] together
[1:12:56] amen
[1:13:05] amen so he says here what was the
[1:13:08] condition of the place he says it's
[1:13:10] known in history it was a rocket place
[1:13:12] and that is the same way the uh aatr was
[1:13:15] called it was called a rocket rocket
[1:13:19] Mountain praise the Lord now it's a
[1:13:22] tourist place because the the the the
[1:13:25] government has closed down the the
[1:13:27] prison place there so people goes there
[1:13:29] just to see what it was amen so uh uh uh
[1:13:35] brother Jordan if you can help me with
[1:13:36] uh with our picture I wanted I wanted
[1:13:39] for us to have an an idea of what this
[1:13:41] prison looks
[1:13:43] like now according to history the
[1:13:48] earthquake in uh in
[1:13:50] 1906 that took place in California onum
[1:13:54] is buried in this
[1:13:57] ocean praise the Lord this place it
[1:14:01] looks like an island but it's it's it's
[1:14:04] also in its geographical position it's a
[1:14:10] mountain praise the Lord amen it's it's
[1:14:15] it's a mountain because the depth of
[1:14:18] this water is impossible to cross right
[1:14:24] [Music]

[1:14:31] how the island of pmos
[1:14:33] was it was an
[1:14:35] island he said yeah the

[1:15:08] island there was there was no way of
[1:15:15] escape and it was it was it was it was
[1:15:18] known it was buil for notorious

[1:28:51] and he fell at the back of his head she
[1:28:53] heard the sound she ran out and he was

[1:29:33] and just crying God you know save this
[1:29:35] man and and and and and and uh uh uh

[1:30:02] look there and see and see what was what
[1:30:04] was going
[1:30:07] on and I think I think she and her
[1:30:10] husband got a little bit concerned
[1:30:11] because she she lost her mother from a
[1:30:14] brain surgery so it kind of gave her a a
[1:30:17] reflex on that and and they didn't want
[1:30:20] it to do that
[1:30:22] but uh by the grace of God the old man
[1:30:25] is sitting up talking and he's doing
[1:30:28] well praise the Lord amen she was at she
[1:30:33] was at home alone I mean it was not a
[1:30:35] church there it was not in church it was

[1:46:06] for uh uh trap people mind amen praise
[1:46:10] the
[1:46:11] Lord he said on the island of pmos and
[1:46:14] the other one was called Paul in the
[1:46:16] Roman federal prison and Daniel he was
[1:46:19] also in the prison house and Brother
[1:46:21] Joseph because uh uh uh that he had been
[1:46:25] accused of something that uh he was
[1:46:29] innocent serve years by trying to be a
[1:46:33] real servant to portify and his wife
[1:46:35] accus him and he was condemned and laid
[1:46:39] in prison for years until his whisker
[1:46:42] and his hair grew out you know uh as you
[1:46:45] read the story you don't pick it up but
[1:46:48] you go back in the book of Psalm the
[1:46:50] Bible say he was in
[1:46:52] shackles praise the Lord he was in
[1:46:55] shackles our owner shackles is not
[1:46:57] chained around our hands amen we are
[1:47:01] bound with with just like just like BR
[1:47:04] Braham says you know Satan uh uh being
[1:47:07] loose and being bound is a chain of
[1:47:10] circumstance our want change that is
[1:47:13] change of
[1:47:15] situations praise the Lord their chains
[1:47:18] were literal chains our chains are
[1:47:20] change of situations we are bound with
[1:47:23] different situations all around us it's
[1:47:26] always one or the
[1:47:29] other amen so yeah he was bound and he
[1:47:33] laid in prison for years until his wi
[1:47:36] and the head grew out even had to shave
[1:47:40] him to take him before Pharaoh show what
[1:47:44] was uh anything wrong for the cause of
[1:47:48] Christ he identified ing all of these
[1:47:51] guys going to praison because of the
[1:47:54] word of their day because of the purpose
[1:47:57] of God for their
[1:47:59] day and the purpose of God for this day
[1:48:03] also have to be manifested in the bride
[1:48:05] in the
[1:48:09] people praise the Lord this is not just
[1:48:13] church making people it's more than
[1:48:16] Church
[1:48:17] making because one of these day we come
[1:48:19] close to that time you know uh uh uh uh
[1:48:23] and you know and that's that's word you
[1:48:26] know uh I'm trusting the Lord to to kind
[1:48:29] of bring it out where where you be able
[1:48:31] to see you know the persecution and the
[1:48:39] squeeze they turn to look the same but
[1:48:42] they are not the
[1:48:44] same the Bible says all them that take
[1:48:47] the name of Jesus Christ will suffer
[1:48:49] persecution
[1:48:51] that is to all
[1:48:52] believers but there is a people that
[1:48:56] will be
[1:48:57] squeezed to produce the literal life of
[1:49:00] Jesus Christ yes
[1:49:02] sir there will be a bride that will be
[1:49:07] squeeze praise the
[1:49:10] Lord when we entertain ourself with
[1:49:12] little compromise here and little
[1:49:14] compromise here always trying to find a
[1:49:16] way that to justify ourself this that I
[1:49:19] mean at that time there will be no
[1:49:21] character in you to bear
[1:49:26] that there will be no character in you
[1:49:28] to bear
[1:49:32] that when there is no pressure on us yet
[1:49:35] we stay try to find little shortcut here
[1:49:38] and little shortcut there while if it's
[1:49:39] pressure come there will be no character
[1:49:41] in you to be able to bring for that Life
[1:49:44] of Christ that's why that word squeeze
[1:49:47] is
[1:49:49] useful
[1:49:54] it's a portion that is kept for the
[1:49:59] brde where she will be
[1:50:01] squeezed and Christ will be on the scene
[1:50:05] just like shedra mishad and they
[1:50:08] were
[1:50:09] squeez even if our Lord don't deliver us
[1:50:13] we will not bow down that was a
[1:50:18] squeeze all the religion people all the
[1:50:21] Jews in the land were buying down they
[1:50:24] stood right there they say we are not
[1:50:25] buying
[1:50:27] down even if God don't deliver us but
[1:50:30] you see they were squeezed into a foric
[1:50:33] seven time he and what came out of it
[1:50:36] the son of man was identified with him
[1:50:40] that even the king could see there were
[1:50:41] four men in the
[1:50:43] fire that's what that moment is all
[1:50:46] about praise the
[1:50:49] Lord
[1:50:52] it's not because I want to buy iPhone I
[1:50:53] don't have money or I'm going through
[1:50:55] persecution that to buy iPhone that
[1:50:58] persecution praise the Lord because you
[1:51:01] want you want iPhone so you going that
[1:51:03] is that why you call
[1:51:09] persecution B said they were all on the
[1:51:11] island for the ca of
[1:51:15] Christ let's pay attention to that you
[1:51:18] know let's pay attention the things that
[1:51:20] we deal with the way we deal with
[1:51:23] faith when we trust God it it boasts our
[1:51:29] confidence because we need to grow daily
[1:51:32] in trust we need to grow daily we says
[1:51:36] he's an everpresent God we need to grow
[1:51:40] Experiencing God coming on the
[1:51:45] same praise the Lord Experiencing God
[1:51:49] coming on the
[1:51:55] sin and that's what I'm trusting that
[1:51:57] God will do for uh our brother John BBI
[1:52:00] amen that God will come on the sin
[1:52:02] praise the
[1:52:04] Lord amen that God will come on the s i
[1:52:08] i I'll speak more than that uh uh uh on
[1:52:11] the weekend so let me let me not take
[1:52:13] all the time I have 10 minutes here so
[1:52:16] brother I'm talking about this and he's
[1:52:17] giving these different testimony Joseph
[1:52:19] and all of these people place here he
[1:52:21] says and then spend $2 and5 million for
[1:52:25] a race cause to pollute and and them and
[1:52:28] send souls to Hell talking about God
[1:52:31] coming quickly see what brother BR say
[1:52:34] he says but the Arkansas people at that
[1:52:36] time they did something about it every
[1:52:39] church he said I think now or 10
[1:52:41] different denomination of them in the
[1:52:43] community he says all they all got
[1:52:46] together and he said it was wrong praise
[1:52:50] the Lord and they won't have it and they
[1:52:53] form a prayer meeting and they take a a
[1:52:57] prayer chain day in day day day in and
[1:53:00] out night in and
[1:53:03] out and when the Jorge and the federal
[1:53:07] men and and and they all went to the
[1:53:09] court the next morning to settle it he
[1:53:11] said whether they could build it or net
[1:53:14] the went in met he says and it was
[1:53:16] defeated prayer changed things amen I
[1:53:18] don't care how rotting the world is how
[1:53:21] rotting our country is how rotten the
[1:53:24] nation is our people our prayer change
[1:53:27] things amen praise the
[1:53:30] Lord God is more than
[1:53:34] able he's a God the answer
[1:53:38] prayer if we would just discipline
[1:53:42] ourself and learn to just take things to
[1:53:45] the Lord in prayer earnestly Lord I
[1:53:47] don't know I don't I don't know what to
[1:53:49] do I give it to you I'm committing it in
[1:53:52] your hands praise the
[1:53:55] Lord and wait let the Lord help you
[1:53:58] before you start figuring it out and
[1:54:00] start and no no no no you give it to the
[1:54:02] Lord wait on
[1:54:05] him Lord give me understanding Lord give
[1:54:07] me
[1:54:12] Grace because prayer change
[1:54:18] things what is a prayer what is a prayer
[1:54:21] chain it's just a disciplined time
[1:54:23] that's what Daniel did Daniel had a
[1:54:25] prayer chain he never needed a 20 person
[1:54:27] he had his own prayer chain because
[1:54:29] there was an appointed time every day
[1:54:31] that he
[1:54:32] met an appointed time that's what prayer
[1:54:35] chain
[1:54:36] is it's either I I decide that will meet
[1:54:39] at appointed time or we come together
[1:54:41] and says well let meet six let's meet 9
[1:54:44] let's meet
[1:54:45] 12 at that time we know that somebody
[1:54:47] will be praying because the the
[1:54:49] scripture say when two or three agreed
[1:54:51] on
[1:54:56] anything even husband and wife can have
[1:54:59] a prayer chain and says well we are
[1:55:01] trusting the Lord for this let's let's
[1:55:03] let's put it before the Lord you know
[1:55:04] let's meet uh in the morning let's meet
[1:55:06] at the set time what whatever time you
[1:55:08] you want
[1:55:10] to but it's a sense of discipline a
[1:55:12] sense of commitment a sense of
[1:55:18] devotion
[1:55:23] and B BR says those people got together
[1:55:25] and they pray that spirit away from the
[1:55:28] place they defeated it in
[1:55:36] court and I believe
[1:55:38] that as a church we can be able to
[1:55:43] defeat things that are rising around us
[1:55:46] that sh
[1:55:48] not praise the Lord
[1:55:52] amen it don't have to be a public
[1:55:56] thing a brother and and and and and and
[1:55:59] his wife can come together and says well
[1:56:01] you know I don't know what what's
[1:56:02] actually going on but I think there's a
[1:56:03] need in that family let's let's pray for
[1:56:06] them you don't need to blow it over the
[1:56:09] building that's
[1:56:11] right you don't need to pour postard all
[1:56:14] on the street if you do that you're just
[1:56:16] looking for self Glory
[1:56:18] right
[1:56:20] but you are praying and you are watching
[1:56:21] you are just trusting the Lord and you
[1:56:24] see things
[1:56:28] happening if we don't if if we don't
[1:56:31] learn to come to that place of of of
[1:56:33] some sense of of self
[1:56:36] discipline where we can be able to keep
[1:56:38] things before the Lord and keep our
[1:56:39] heart before the Lord I mean that's how
[1:56:42] we grow in character to trust the
[1:56:48] Lord amen
[1:56:52] you realize that uh we are so loud about
[1:56:55] the things that we are complaining
[1:56:58] about

[2:04:03] of God of the testimon of Jesus Christ
[2:04:07] the burden that he had on his heart Lord
