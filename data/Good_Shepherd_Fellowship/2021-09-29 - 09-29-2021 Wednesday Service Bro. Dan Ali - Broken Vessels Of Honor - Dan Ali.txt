before you and you know us inside out there is nothing that is hidden before you father and we pray that you will touch every heart oh god may you touch every soul when we look at our lives father there is always something that makes us feel insufficient and you knew all about it before you even called us and father oh god we are in your hands and we are trusting that you will deal with us in

over tonight's service father and speak to your children from lip to ear that we shall not leave your presence the way we came in in jesus name amen shall we be seated musicians god bless you all good to see you brother ariel i wasn't expecting to see you tonight the praise be to god yes it's good to see everyone of you here tonight the life in america is very busy and until i came to america i never understood that uh what did they used to say um time time is precious the money i never understood that yeah there are people that will give you their money but it will be very difficult to give you their time and in the midst of the busy schedules the busy life if you can make time to come and seek the face of god it will be a blessing i know work is keeping some people away from service and we understand that god understands that and there are people that cannot be here tonight for a good reason so to speak and god knows all about that yes so for every empty seat you see it means that somebody is either tuning in watching online or something of the sort praise be to god yes so um just trusting god because as the days are getting to a head the devil would make sure he keeps us very busy and we just have to find time you have to we have to there are no excuses whatsoever we have to find time to serve god praise be to god just this morning around between 6 and 6 30 i was standing with my supervisor and somebody just came he said donnelly it was a note i wrote it very very small very very very small letters and normally when something comes to me i write it down when i go to work i put it on the computer so i got to work on monday day something like that and i didn't know why i kept the paper so he comes with it donna lee donnelly i saw a paper in the office and it's written god is written on it and i thought it has to be yours and i said thank you it didn't mean anything much until 30 minutes later and this is somebody that i have not had any conversations with the only conversation i ever had with him was he asking me probably a year ago that i hear you are a preacher then i said yes then i said oh i'm sorry uh all the cursing i've been casting around you i'm sorry forgive me and i saw you are forgiven then we all laughed about it but um and he said i will never do that no more i said good and it was just like making a new year resolution that you make the new year resolution in those days we used to do them before nine o'clock in the morning you have already broken every one of them i don't know about you but before nine on new year's day i broke every one of them praise be to god and he never kept it but at least you know just live your life in a way and let the people around you know who you are never try to be like somebody else never desire to be like somebody else know that you are special in the sight of god it doesn't matter what people say know that you are a son and a daughter of god and you are special in the sight of god praise be to god now when i was thinking of what to come and share tonight i had a lot of things sitting down and i was wondering on a wednesday night looking at our time and this came to me and it's one of those random things that just come and i put it down and tonight by the grace of god we'll be looking at this if we can just take our bibles and turn over to the book of romans romans 9 romans 9. 20 21 romans 9 20 21 nay but o man who add thou that replies against god shall the teen formed say to him that formed it why has thou made me thus have not deported power over the clay of the same lamp to make one vessel onto anna and another unto this honor may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his amen shall we be seated now when you look at the scripture we have just read there is no unrighteousness with god from the scripture we have just read god being the potter could have decided i am going to make one vessel as a vessel of honor and another one as a vessel of this owner and that is the end of the story it doesn't matter what you do nothing would change it now man is a vessel so we are not talking of any other vessel we are just talking about man the title of my message tonight is broken vessels of honor broken vessels of honor now when you look at a vessel that is a vessel of honor why should that vessel be broken because we are talking about two vessels here one of honor the other of dishonor probably it may make a lot of sense to say broken vessels of this owner because they are dishonorable they should be broken because naturally the word broken when it's been attached to anything it doesn't give a good picture is either spoiling it or destroying it or something else but you talk of a broken vessel of honor a vessel that is honorable to be subject to that to be broken and you ask yourself why and the reason is simple the reason why a vessel of honor would be broken is because it's a vessel of honor that is why it must be broken and as simple as it is the reason why a vessel of this owner would not be broken it's just because that vessel is dishonorable now breaks and satan breaks so you don't have to worry when you are broken it depends on the house in which you are because god does not break to kill god does not break to destroy because the bible tells us in the book of jeremiah 29 i believe it is that i know that thought i have concerning you a story of good and not of evil to bring you to an expected end and for god so loved the world that he gave us his only begotten son i came that you may have life and have life more abundantly i am the way the truth and the life no matter the father except we can go on and on and on and on and on and we know that when god is breaking you he doesn't break to destroy it's like in those days here in america i don't get to see a lot of things especially in the hinterlands you'll find some of these you know herbalists that are helping people somebody is sick they go to the bush they just get some leaves put it together the people drink and they are okay and sometimes they bring a child a child with a broken limb and sometimes the parents bring this child when it is too late and the leg is healed or the hand is healed and the child is now comfortable in the position they are living in now even though they are not working right but they are comfortable that at least they are not feeling the pain anymore they have adjusted to walking up and down and they are okay with it but the father or the mother sits on the side and looks at the child and say no i will not allow this to go on i have to find help for this child because if they grow with it they will get to a point where it will be too late and nothing can be done about it and now they carry this child to this village herbalist and then he sits and he looks at this child and they are also parents they are human beings they have feelings and sometimes it's so difficult for them to to do it because when they the wound is already healed they have to break the bone all over in order to realign it and sometimes they sit and they put their hand on the leg and as the word is okay this is why it's misaligned and then the child is sitting down on the mother's lap and wondering what is going on what are they doing here and then the man just takes the leg breaks it and the child just yells and at this point this child will be wondering oh i didn't know mommy hates me this much why would mommy do this to me oh mommy is wicked who is this man here he has broken my leg what is it that pain is not meant to destroy it's meant to make that child better but at that point when they are going through that pain they wouldn't see it but when they are healed and they begin to walk right and life comes back to normal that is when they begin to appreciate it and that is how it is with god god does not break to destroy he doesn't break to kill we know as the bible says the devil has comfort to steal to kill and to destroy and when he is breaking he breaks to destroy if he is breaking he breaks to kill but not without god praise be to god we are talking about broken vessels of honor i was trying to print a lot of things at work and for some reason i couldn't just get through and i just took a few notes down and i'll just read them off here so bear with me now in the massage supernatural the supernatural the prophet said we realize that this is like experience sometimes we have to go through terrible chastening of the lord and i mean i was just writing with my pen i just put the dot um you can you can you can go and visit it to correct us to make us fruit-bearing christians and god would prune you he would cut certain things off and he will take sentence away in the message exhortation of divine healing mary brown said i have to admit it that sometimes our heavenly father testing us with sickness permitting satan to do it to try to bring us back if we were to go astray but it only is only for the good praise be to the lord it's only for the good so god will chasten you in triumphs and god would allow satan to also come in temptations and we know as the prophet has said satan is also awake man for god god uses him as a whip to put you in line and we can see satan in the life of job it wasn't because he did anything wrong or he was of course but we saw how god permitted him but when god does permit satan to come the boundaries are set because when he is coming he is coming with a destructive mind and god is not allowing him to come and destroy but there is something good god wants to bring out so god says the boundaries praise be to god the testing of our father is not pleasant for a season but it works together for good and it is not easy i don't know if i'm going ahead of myself that is fine when you are going through chastening it is a very difficult time in every every christian life and i believe some of us can attest to that in the message the efficient church age no matter how just and upright a christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess christ as his savior and acknowledge the oppression of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned the spirit of this world has the spirit of god and because it can't overcome the spirit of the lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of truth dwells persecution and trials are natural normal part of christian life this is only one thing you can do about them commit them all to god judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to god persecution brother branham is saying is a normal part of christian life how many of us are ready for that praise be to god it is not going out there and looking for trouble no the trouble will find you anyhow but what it does come are you ready for it a lot of the times when we are going through trials and temptations we dishonor god we fail to see the hand god is pulling the strength and we complain we murmur we say things we shouldn't say we do things we shouldn't do and we let god down broken vessels of honor there is honor in royalty when you look at the queen of england the king of wales and in any in every country why they still have this monarchy you see that there is honor in royalty the kings even right down to the village chiefs sometimes you go to a place and there are only 10 15 buildings and you go there you want to go and cut trees and hotel you have to see the chief and not just the chief but you see their children parading in the street and people say oh that is the king's son that's the king's daughter that's the prince that's the princess there is honor attached to it i know in america here the system is different but we can look at the president there is honor in being the president of this country it's an honorable position but there is no honor that is bestowed on man that is greater than being a child of god you being a son or a daughter of god there is more honor in that than being the president of this country there is more honor in that than being the king of wales there is honor honor in being a child of god just know who you are and appreciate what god is doing a lot of the times we don't see what god is doing in our personal lives because we are carried away by the things that are happening around here is on social media in the community at work we got carried away and we forget who we are and what god is doing there is honor in being a child of god and we are honorable children of god we are not here tonight to talk about verses of dishonor no we are here to talk about vessels of honor to talk about ourselves as children of god our sons and daughters of god that is what we are here to talk about tonight vessels of honor and don't forget we are talking about broken vessels of honor now when you look at the earth or the land for the land to be useful the land must be crushed until that piece of land is crushed it's of no use to the farmer because there are trees and there are grasses everywhere the farmer will now go and throw his seed on the ground he would go cut down the trees plough it put implements through the through the soil turn it upside down level it and what have you so for the land to live to its full potential the land has to die to itself he said the land two dies yes the land two dies year in year out as you cultivate the piece of land the land is dying and that i know it by example i did i don't i didn't learn that from school because you guys know i love farming after some time the land begins to lose its nutrients and you have to leave that land to follow for some years so you can come back to it so it tells you that the land is dying so for that land to be able to yield its full potential the land must die to itself and that is when it becomes useful to the farmer until then the land is only living for itself if you ever knew that piece of land before and you came back to it you would realize that there is a nature change that the land is no longer the land you used to know you will realize that all the trees are gone and the land has been turned upside down the nature has changed it's ready to yield its potential this time it's also like a grain of which for a grain of wheat to become useful and to support life it must be crushed it must be crushed until then it is living for itself they would have to carry it to the mill grind it sifter it grind it over and when they are done that is not the end either they are going to cook it or fry it or put it through the oven 375 degrees it must die to itself in order to be able to give life to others in order to be able to yield its full potential it must be crushed and for the bull or the cow to be able to give life you go to the farm and you see a very big cow in its majestic colors with his hunch back just walking on the field if you were the farmer you will stop to death the only way that cow be that's useful to you is when that cow is crushed now when you come back all you see you don't see a cow anymore all you see is a bloody pile of mess yes there is a nature change now you go to the dining room on the dinner table and there is food there is a steak but a cow had to die to produce that stake praise be to god broken vessels of honor and anything that is crushed or anything that dies to itself you would never see is a its origin because it has died to its natural self it is now a new creation if you knew it before and you are now looking at it you see a complete picture and for man to be useful in the hands of god man must be crushed and we are not just talking about man per se we are talking about children of god for you to be useful in the hands of god you must be crushed you must die to yourself but in your original sinful state you are of no use to god it doesn't mean you are not a child of god you are a child of god all right but you are not yet useful in the hands of god you have to die to your old nature in order for the holy ghost to take over and begin to live through you the lord jesus said if any man comes after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me and you don't get to choose your cross deny yourself there are tales we ought to deny ourselves from every day we live there are things we ought to deny ourselves of and daily you take up your cross and the cross is the sound of persecution shame reproach you bear it there is a cross for every one of us if you are not carrying your cross you better look for look look at where you left it but there is a cross for every one of us and you think christ was the only one to go through what he went through no every one of us has a cross to carry there is persecution that we all must go through in one way or the other we are going to be broken but it is not because god wants to destroy us but there is something in the inside god wants to bring out and that thing can only come out when god harms you down breaks you here and there in order to be able to get to that thing and it doesn't come easily praise be to god amen behold before that i want us can we turn to hebrews 12 hebrews 12 hebrews 12 5-11 hebrews 12 5 and ye have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not doubt the chastening of the lord nor faint went thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth that he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth every son whom he receiveth for that matter every daughter whom he receiveth if ye end your chest in him god delivered you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chestness not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and gave and gave them reverence and we gave them reference shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and leave praise be to god for they verily for a few days trusting us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness praise be to god now no chastening for the present simmer to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby yes our parents oh now we are also parents sometimes we're chasing the children after our own pleasure and sometimes in those days i'll tell you i'll not pay your school fees you are you you are going to starve to death you are not coming home just after our own pleasure praise the lord but god when he is doing it is for our prophet and the bible has made it clear no chastening for the present time is joyous you would cry you would will you have sleepless nights you'll go through torture but it is all in the design of god praise be to god it's all in the design of god and behold i send you a sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves what do wolves do to sheep they tear them apart they eat them so right away you know what you are getting into going were those days where they used to preach as this prosperity gospel and make you think that i mean a christian the life has to be rosy you don't have to encounter any problems you don't have to encounter any difficulties life has to be good every day you have to get everything you want everything you need everybody has to be a friend anywhere you go the door should be open for you and with that mindset people get into trouble and immediately they want to quit because that is not what they have been told but don't be deceived that is not the way god would chasten every son and every daughter that comes to him and the bible has made it clear if you are not going through any testimony you are a bastard but we are not bastards we have a father praise be to god and we have to endure whatever it is that comes our way eternal life as a prophet says is living for others and you can't even be a christian until you begin to live for others we are so selfish sometimes that even in our prayer lives we don't even remember others it's just we we me me me me me christianity living for others and there is no way you can live for others until you are truly dead to yourself that is when you actually begin to live for others but until then life is all about you if you are not in the picture then it's not worth it it becomes difficult putting somebody else ahead of you because life is just all about you a life that is not worth being disturbed it's not worth living for i lived in a mining area for a while and you see two pieces of land line adjacent each other and there is one that people don't disturb at all but there is this one here people go there with their excavators and they excavate the land they are pushing down the trees getting down to the rocks digging holes like foxes why because that piece of land is rich that piece of land hardly groceries because the people will not allow it to even grow trees why because that land is rich with minerals but there is this other one here nobody even bothers it and they come they excavate the land they get to the roots they gather the rocks out and they grind it with machines into powder and then they go through the process just to extract the gold out of it because of the wealth hiding in that piece of land it attracts attention now people are going to torture it they are going to persecute it why because it is holding a mystery the land itself doesn't know what it is holding and that is the same way with our lives sometimes we do not even know who we are sometimes we don't even know what we are worth sometimes we think we are like any other person but the devil looking at us knows who we are sometimes more than we do and you wonder why the devil would not let you rest it's because you are holding a mystery in your life the devil looks at you and he sees something you are not seeing because the gold the the gold miners when they come with their instruments their prospect and they can tell you how rich the land is and they will do anything to get to the roots of it they will do anything why because there is a wealth sitting in the heart of that land they must get to it if the devil is not tormenting you you should be disturbed about it you should be worried you should be worried if the devil is not if you have not attracted the devil's attention if the devil is okay with you you should be worried but you should bless the name of the lord if all hell is turned loose against you it shows that something good is happening inside there for you to attract the devil's attention and for the devil to come against you it shows how much you are blessed it shows how much something good in your life is happening we are here to serve one purpose is good to work as we have always said is good to go to school it is good to do anything you want to do if the word of god does not stop you that is okay go ahead and do it but when it comes to your christian faith never compromise never there should be nothing in this life that should let you compromise on your faith all the degrees we get one day we will leave them hanging on the walls and will be gone they are not going to speak for us all the money we wait for one day if we still have them in the banks we are going to leave them and go the money would not help you out i like something steve jobs said before he died he was a billionaire very rich but he said whether in his sick bed on his dying bed he said that if it is money he has the money but the money cannot save him conditions are going to get harder they are not going to get any better so if you think that over time it's going to help it's not going to get worse because what is going to happen that eventually you are going to be distracted and you will spend more time working more time making the money you don't even see to pay the bills and you never catch up with it you never catch up i don't catch up with my bills so i don't worry about them they compile if they are not tired piling up that is fine because the harder i try the more i fail so i just do my best i will not overwhelm myself because i want to catch up no i will not use time i should use for god to go to work when i can come to the house of god i will not do it there is not not enough money you can pay me to come to work on a sunday it's not worth it all the things we are struggling for in this life we are not carrying them anywhere to sum it all up it's a waste of time does it mean we shouldn't work no the bible says if you don't work you shouldn't eat so if you want to stop don't work so the work will do it but we will not allow the devil to exploit us every time the doors are open and we ought to be here we'll be here by the grace of god do not let anything stop you just know it because this life if you take god out of the equation everything else is useless can you imagine living a life without christ we have all been there once upon a time but in those days you didn't even realize it but now that you are seated in christ god forbid if the world should ever happen and you find yourself back in that condition that darkness is very gross that condition is very terrible when you take god out of the life of a man he is left with nothing pity those people out there pray for them you look at them you think they are enjoying life they are not enjoying life it's better to die penniless than to have all the wealth of this world and die without god praise beauty god jeremiah 23 jeremiah 23 29 jeremiah 23 29 it is not my way it's not my word like as a fire say of the lord and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces and that is the word we have believed jeremiah is saying that the word of god is like hammer it breaks the rock into pieces broken vessels of honor you accept christ as your lord and personal savior the whole of hell is turn loose against you and we also know that when the whole of hell is turn loose against you the whole of heaven is behind you but there are things that god will allow you to go through god himself will chasten you and he will also give the devil chance to come and afflict you all because there is something good in you as a daughter of god all because there is something good in you as a son of god and that pain must come forth and except you are broken down and that that thing is never coming out you must be broken down the flesh must give way and when you are going through those trying moments all you can do as the prophet of god said just praise god ask god to help you a lot of the times we see the storms we don't know where they are coming from there is a hand behind that is pulling the strings if you are not careful by the way you react you can dishonor god and it is meant for your own good there is nothing that god would do just because god wants to inflict pain on you that is not the god we are serving oh say yeah it's painful it's painful i'm dying yes it may be painful you may be dying but it is not meant to kill you there is something in you god is bringing out and god will bring it out anyhow praise be to god the bible says jesus led obedience by the things he suffered and the obedience here is character and we saw what he went through he being the son of god was not left out he been the word made flesh did not live above the flesh did not leave did not live about above the world he being the word made flesh did not live above the word he was obedient even unto death he learned obedience by the things he suffered praise be to god we know what he went through how he was afflicted bruised scarred all over finally hung on the cross for our sake and a man who came to introduce him john the baptist how did he go he was beheaded and when you read all through the ages especially in the dark ages the believers what happened to them and it was all for the love of god you think god was asleep but it pleased god for them to go through what they went through job job lent obedience character job when he was going through his affliction he got to a point he said naked i came from a mother's womb and naked i will retain heater and the prophet of god brother branham said naked we came but we are going back with character praise be to god now job learned character he did just look at job a prophet of god a prophet of god when job made that statement he had not yet gotten that revelation it was just a natural man even though a prophet of god with his natural mind in a natural setting if you listen to his conversation because job sees the grass they just grow they die and when the rest begin these grasses grow off again he sees the trees they die they shed their leaves when the seasons change here they come again you cut out a tree it will burn on the side and then he would ask himself but how about man when a man dies where does he go how about man i know about the trees i know about the grasses but how about man it was just a man in his natural environment with his natural mind trying to peace out trying to figure out something and when you look at it from that point on till when he had his trial he was still the same man nothing had changed yet but when he was going through those trials in one day you know the story all that happened losing his some of his house man losing his animals losing his children everything what did he say naked i came and naked i would go praise be to god anyhow he did not let god down and when the devil came back again and afflicted him this time with boils painful boils till this man didn't even know what to do anymore he was just down and completely out and yet he will not cast god tell his wife the only person that was supposed to be encouraging him said why don't you curse your god and die he said don't speak to one of those foolish women tell me what is this this was character at his best [Music] character at this at his best praise be to god and when he had pleased god and god just opened the curtain a little praise be to god shall we just read let me see job let's go to the book of job job 19 job 19 25 job 19 25 yes for i know that my redeemer lives and that he shall stand at the latter day upon at a later day upon the earth and do after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and my eyes shall behold him and not another do my reigns be consumed within me but ye should say oh okay i act 27 i'm good with 27 whom i shall see with my eyes praise be to god and not another do my reigns be consumed within me praise be to god at this point job the job you knew before the trial was different after this revelation he was not he was no longer trying to imagine trying to think but he now knows for sure what happens when a man dies praise be to god and brother comes and he says that we shall go back with character yes we are going back with character when you look at job that was character at its best and there is that trying moment for every one of us job didn't do anything wrong the reason why he went through what he went through was because god had so much confidence in him because he was living right because he was doing the right things because he was standing for god because he had declared his position because he had made himself known and when you have taken your position with god when you have taken a stand with the lord's despised few when you have decided to walk with christ and no longer to go back into the world you are going to go through trials you are going to go through temptations life is not going to be easy life is not going to be rosy your cross may be different from mine they don't have to be the same but everybody has a cross to carry everybody is going through one persecution or the other whichever way it comes is a persecution anyhow god is the one who decides what to bring your way you don't call for it and he doesn't bring it when you're expecting it he doesn't come and ask your opinion or your permission no that is why you just have to stay consecrated every single moment keep pushing on whether rain or shine just know whatever it is that you're going through also remember that there are believers all over the world that are going through the same thing some are even going through westerns and if they are standing it shows that you can also stand praise beauty god on that day when we all meet together and everybody is telling their stories you also have a story to share praise be to god broken vessels of honor because we are children of god we are honorable children and because we are honorable children of god god is going to break us anyhow but the intention is not to kill the intention is not to destroy the intention is to bring the best out of you so whatever it is that you may be going through it may be on the job that will promote everybody people you train on the job don't promote them and every time you are still at the same place when the year ends you don't even get a quarter of the bonus they get they got all the race but somebody is sitting on yours it might be in a form of sickness now god would allow it just for your own good it can be anything it can be anything yes but whatever it is that you are going through always remember that you are a child of god and that the reason why you are going through that is because you are a child of god and you can get to that place to stay with paul for me to leave is christ and to die is gain [Applause] i have just one thing here our time is i didn't have much to share i just wanted to make gurus of the time and praise be to god yes so the love of god the love of god would take you through anything there are storms that god will say this time i'm not taking over the storm this time i am not taking you beneath the storm you are going to go through the mail and then you stand and you look inside there and you know that to go in there is starting by death and god is going to take you through that meal and then you are going to come out on the other side hole and at that point life makes a lot more sense to you than it has ever been and you know that it is not your effort you know that this is the hand of god and you know that if it hadn't been for god there is no way this can happen because there is no way of explaining it there is no way of explaining it and if you have to die in those moments the bible says that the death of his sins is precious in his sight if you die believing you have not lost anything you have not lost anything if you die a believer you have not lost anything if you die a child of god standing on the word of god standing on the promises of god you have not lost anything never fear death anyway death meets us we are ready to go the devil cannot torment you with with the fear of death that is not a portion what you should fear most is to live in sin what you should fear most is to compromise belief but so long as you are living by the world so long as you are staying your grounds so long as you can see yourself in the pages of the scriptures so long as you are doing that which is pleasing in the sight of god do not care where death meets you it doesn't matter what time of day john the baptist went without his head but on that day we shall see him with his head praise be to god others were fed to the lions they didn't even have a carcass to bury but on that day praise be to god we shall see them face to face there is life beyond the grave the grave is not the end and the devil cannot use the grave to threaten us no don't let the devil get into your territory own it it is yours you are a child of god with promise praise be to god broken vessels of honor musicians can you please come over so know who you are know what you have believed we have not believed canningly devised fables we have believed the truth of the word we are standing for the word nothing by the word nothing else can take the place of god in your life if you want to look outside there and you look at people outside there and sometimes you are tempted to be like them never try it never try it you can look at the lives of other people how they drifted away from the truth and god by his grace brought them in and you look at it and say oh i can also do it god will bring me it may not be the same for you praise be to god brother one god bless your sense [Music] um [Music] to follow jesus no turning back [Music] to follow jesus oh i have decided to follow jesus to follow jesus no turning back i'll read this uh verse in the bible before we pray tonight that's over in revelation chapter 2 and it's it's to the message i mean to the church of pajamas and to the angel of the church in pagamos right these things say he we should have the sharp sword with two edge which is the word verse 13 i know that works and where thou doer i know that works i know exactly where you are even where satan's seed is and thou hold as fast my name and have not denied my faith now there were three things present in that age the word which is the the two actual the name of the lord jesus christ and the faith of the son of man even in those days were in enterprise was my faithful my child who was slain among you where satan dwelleth let's pray together now just to think about an age that was called the seat of satan and there is no word in history you even read josephus and you read many histories not many will say anything about the life of enterprise but here in the scripture the bible mentioned that he was faithful living in an age that was the seat of satan and here we are we find ourselves in this laodicean age that is more evil and more wicked than the pygamus church age oh i believe that god is still going to have faithful ones he's still going to have faithful martians are people faithful witnesses that we stand for the word of god no matter what we are going through especially in times like this let's pray together tonight as we bring this service to one end that god will give us grace we will be able to lift the name of jesus up [Music] we will be able to thank god even when we fail in a test we'll be able to thank god and no matter what come our way we will take the attitude to give thanks [Music] the lord will give us a thankful heart
