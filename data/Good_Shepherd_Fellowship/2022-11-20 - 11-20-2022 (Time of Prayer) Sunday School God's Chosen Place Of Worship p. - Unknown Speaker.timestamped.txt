[0:00] seated walked down to put his arms
[0:02] around me and he said these words
[0:05] brother Branham I hope this don't sound
[0:07] sacrilegious
[0:09] but said that could be made the 23rd
[0:12] chapter of Revelations which is only 22
[0:15] chapters in Revelation
[0:17] he said I hope this don't sound
[0:18] sacrilegious he had no more and said it
[0:21] now the boy was a Baptist and know
[0:22] nothing about the supernatural with his
[0:25] arms around me he started talking in an
[0:28] unknown language
[0:30] and when he got through speaking in an
[0:32] unknown language there was a heavyset
[0:35] dark woman sitting right in front of me
[0:37] she raised up said I don't need any
[0:39] interpretation she said I'm from
[0:41] Shreveport Louisiana or Baton Rouge
[0:43] Louisiana said that is purely French
[0:47] Victor Leduc which was a Frenchman also
[0:51] sitting up there said certainly I'm a
[0:53] Frenchman
[0:54] and that was perfectly French I said
[0:56] wait a minute you write down what he
[0:58] said and you write down what he said
[1:00] before you say anything write down what
[1:03] you're saying let's see your notes and
[1:05] so one wrote down and the other wrote
[1:06] down it was even the punctuation was the
[1:09] same
[1:10] and then just about that time when they
[1:12] brought the notes up a fine looking
[1:14] young blonde-headed boy come walking
[1:17] from the back with not enough room for
[1:19] him to sit down he was standing up in
[1:21] the back he'd come walking forward so
[1:22] just a minute I'd like to place a note
[1:24] too he said I am the French interpreter
[1:27] for the U.N
[1:30] United Nations he said I like to leave
[1:33] mano and here are all three notes
[1:35] exactly the same
[1:37] a French and here's the way it reads
[1:43] this is the original notes take a note
[1:45] taken right off this is Danny's naughty
[1:47] self he packed in his pocket of course
[1:48] it went into Christian business and so
[1:50] forth because thou has chosen the Narrow
[1:53] Path
[1:54] the harder way thou has walked in your
[1:58] own choosing thou has picked the correct
[2:01] and precise uh decision and it is my way
[2:07] because of this momentous decision a
[2:12] huge portion of heaven will await thee
[2:14] what a glorious decision thou has made
[2:18] this in itself is that which will give
[2:21] and make come to pass
[2:23] their tremendous victory in the love
[2:26] divine
[2:27] now the man signed his name here the
[2:30] above statement was interpreted by of
[2:34] Danny Henry prophesying
[2:37] over brother Branham given by three
[2:40] Witnesses in the um
[2:45] cafeteria in Los Angeles California now
[2:50] this same young man that give this
[2:53] prophecy not knowing what he was seeing
[2:56] was in Jerusalem about a month ago he
[2:59] had the privilege of going out and and
[3:01] laying in the tomb where Jesus had died
[3:05] and was buried
[3:07] and so while he was laying there he said
[3:10] I come upon his mind real strong and he
[3:14] started weeping said how that it has
[3:17] been so hard for brother Branham to
[3:19] stand against the world in these things
[3:22] in all churches
[3:24] that is it was once said of one of the
[3:26] Billy Graham parts that we can see Billy
[3:28] Graham because all churches in United
[3:30] together for him we see Oral Roberts the
[3:32] Pentecostals but how do we ever have
[3:34] anything was contrary to what people
[3:37] have been taught
[3:38] it's gone and Danny what he does for a
[3:43] hobby he makes little Stones he walked
[3:45] out to where the cross had been put down
[3:48] where they said the cross set in the
[3:50] rock
[3:51] no one was around so he broke off a
[3:53] little piece of Rock
[3:54] and he put it in his pocket for a
[3:56] souvenir come home and maybe a pair of
[3:59] cufflinks out of it and strangely when
[4:01] he made them they looked to be
[4:03] blood-stained and right through each one
[4:06] of them in continuity runs a straight
[4:08] narrow path right through both of them
[4:11] now that might be just
[4:13] um uh see someone else might not notice
[4:17] it but to me it's complementary to the
[4:20] things I believe I believe that
[4:21] everything has the meaning to it and now
[4:24] in this time whatever the Lord has if
[4:28] this isn't the thing that he prophesied
[4:31] of a Malachi for and of also of Luke 17
[4:35] and many other scriptures that's to
[4:37] happen in this last day may I say this
[4:40] in closing it's laid the foundation for
[4:42] the man when he will come
[4:44] so I am very thankful that God Almighty
[4:48] if it's be that way has let me do a
[4:51] little something in my uneducated
[4:53] condition to show my appreciations of
[4:56] his love to me my love to him and our
[4:59] love to the people therefore in
[5:02] sincerity I approach this subject of
[5:05] marriage and divorce may God have mercy
[5:08] on us all amen and now listen closely
[5:12] and sisters
[5:14] don't get up and go out set still just a
[5:17] little while Brothers do the same don't
[5:20] turn off your sets out there that's
[5:22] coming on this hookup don't do that just
[5:26] sit still for a few minutes until it's
[5:27] over listen closely if you disagree put
[5:30] down the scriptures that I use and then
[5:32] study them prayerfully
[5:35] before you make your decision
[5:38] God help us as we try to approach this
[5:42] subject now it may be a little lengthy I
[5:46] don't want you to be in any hurry and uh
[5:48] just take your time all of us and study
[5:51] the word of God truly and thoroughly as
[5:54] we know how to study let's begin with
[5:57] Saint Matthew the 19th Chapter and
[6:00] beginning I think with the eighth verse
[6:03] of the 19th Chapter
[6:05] I wish to start
[6:12] I might start also with the first and
[6:16] read down to the eighth verse of the
[6:18] 19th Chapter now remember
[6:21] these things that I say must come from
[6:24] the word of God
[6:27] it can't be my own opinion because my
[6:29] opinion just like anybody else's but
[6:32] it's got to be in continuity with the
[6:35] word of God remember
[6:37] God keeps everything in continuity he
[6:41] never changes he's the same yesterday
[6:44] today and forever you believe that
[6:47] he's the same
[6:49] now I shall read from the 19th Chapter
[6:52] and he came to pass that when Jesus had
[6:55] finished these things he departed from
[6:58] Galilee and came into the coast of Judea
[7:01] Beyond Jordan
[7:03] and great multitudes followed him and he
[7:06] healed them
[7:07] the Pharisees also came unto him
[7:11] tempting him
[7:15] I pause there so you get the emphasis on
[7:18] who it was that was tempting you
[7:20] saying unto him is it lawful for a man
[7:24] to put away his wife for every cause
[7:27] and he answered and said unto them have
[7:30] you not read that he which made them in
[7:33] the beginning made them male and female
[7:37] and said for this call shall a man leave
[7:39] father mother and shall cleave to his
[7:42] wife and they tween shall be one flesh
[7:47] therefore they are no more tween but one
[7:51] flesh
[7:53] what therefore God has joined together
[7:56] let not man put asunder
[7:59] they said unto him why did Moses then
[8:03] command to give a writing of divorcement
[8:06] and put her away
[8:10] and he said unto them Moses because of
[8:13] the hardness of your heart suffered you
[8:15] to put away your wise but from the
[8:18] beginning it was not so
[8:22] now
[8:24] God help us
[8:26] this
[8:27] scripture
[8:30] this question
[8:32] confronted Jesus at the very beginning
[8:34] of his ministry
[8:38] and it confronted Moses
[8:41] at the very beginning of his ministry
[8:44] it's a foremost question and believer's
[8:48] hearts The Sinner doesn't care
[8:51] but it's two Believers because the
[8:55] believer is trying to do all that he
[8:57] knows how to do to live right before God
[9:02] therefore it any question comes up on
[9:06] religion
[9:08] then the marriage and divorce case comes
[9:11] up
[9:13] why because it is the cause of the
[9:18] original sin
[9:21] that's where sins started
[9:25] and that's the reason it's brought up
[9:27] every time because it is the very
[9:30] beginning of sin
[9:33] now I won't have time to explain all
[9:36] these things but I'll be glad to answer
[9:37] your letter or anything of Canada we got
[9:39] the books wrote on it and many questions
[9:42] and even cuttings out of newspapers and
[9:45] things here to prove this we know that
[9:48] it was Eve the Apple that you were
[9:52] supposed to eat or it's not even
[9:54] scriptural
[9:55] now they claim it was an apricot
[9:58] it was neither one
[10:00] she committed adultery in it brought
[10:05] forth the first child which was Cain
[10:07] Satan's own son
[10:10] or in him laid evil
[10:12] it did not come through Abel
[10:15] Satan's son was Cain I know your
[10:19] question now he said I have gotten a man
[10:22] from the Lord that's exactly right you
[10:24] could take the honoriest woman in the
[10:26] town the worst man if they had a baby
[10:28] you would have to come from the Lord
[10:30] because God has Law set together
[10:34] and
[10:36] these laws like the Sunder age you put a
[10:40] of bird in a good field it'll grow
[10:44] and it has to grow because it's God's
[10:46] law
[10:47] when seed is planted it must grow and
[10:50] nothing can grow life but God because it
[10:53] operates under his laws
[10:56] therefore when the evil seed was planted
[10:58] in the womb of
[11:00] of Eve it had to bring forth because
[11:03] it's God's law a production
[11:08] and he could do nothing else but bring
[11:10] it and it had to come from God
[11:14] that's the reason people say little
[11:16] babies sometimes it's not born with
[11:18] Christian parents are lost Jesus
[11:20] Christ's blood got tones for the child I
[11:22] don't care how much it was born how evil
[11:24] it was born
[11:26] he's the Lamb of God that takes away the
[11:28] sin of the world a little child cannot
[11:29] repeat because it has nothing to repent
[11:31] for and that was the sin of the world
[11:33] which was taken away by the blood of
[11:34] Christ babies go to heaven
[11:38] its original sin and that's the reason
[11:40] it's it's question
[11:44] when any great phenomena comes from God
[11:47] about the first thing what about
[11:48] marriage and divorce
[11:50] now as ever it still is a question
[11:52] amongst the people
[11:55] as it was in the times of Jesus as it
[11:58] was in the times of Moses
[12:00] it's always been and is to this day a
[12:03] question among the people because the
[12:05] people want to know what's the truth
[12:08] but where there is a question there must
[12:11] also be an answer
[12:14] and now being an answer
[12:18] as I have said before this week there
[12:21] must be a correct answer
[12:23] and if we get an answer to anything and
[12:26] it uh it isn't right
[12:28] uh then we know that it was wrong
[12:31] but there's we're still asked to tell
[12:33] the true question is answered
[12:36] if you want to know truth and being this
[12:39] is a Bible question
[12:42] it should be a Bible answer
[12:46] is like I've said if I wanted to go East
[12:49] this morning and the best that I know
[12:52] this I had to find a certain something
[12:54] in the field it was directly east and I
[12:56] went East somebody said brother Branham
[12:59] this is East
[13:01] it is East potentially but it's
[13:04] Northeast
[13:06] I would pass the very object I was
[13:08] looking for I'd come back knowing it was
[13:11] wrong
[13:12] and then if somebody said brother Bram
[13:15] go this way to your right now that is
[13:18] potentially East also but it's Southeast
[13:22] I would lose the object that I was
[13:25] looking for because I went beyond the
[13:27] boundaries of the perfect and direct way
[13:33] now
[13:34] if that be so we have two schools of
[13:37] thought on marriage and divorce
[13:40] and that is one of them says that a man
[13:43] can only be married once unless his wife
[13:46] is dead
[13:48] that's one of the questions
[13:50] but you go to following that you go
[13:53] overboard
[13:56] and then the next says oh if the wife or
[14:00] the husband either one has committed
[14:01] adultery either one of them can be put
[14:04] away and married again you find yourself
[14:07] overboard with that
[14:10] so see it's neither south east or North
[14:14] East we won't directly east
[14:17] you run out of scripture when you go
[14:19] this way you're out of scripture when
[14:21] you go that way we want to know where
[14:23] scripture meets scripture
[14:26] I know what's the truth of it
[14:29] each takes a different way
[14:31] and failed to bring up the correct
[14:33] answer but there still must be an answer
[14:36] it's just like today
[14:40] there's two great schools of Doctrine
[14:43] in the church one of them is Calvinism
[14:47] the other is our myth armenianism
[14:51] one of them is legalist the other one is
[14:54] Grace
[14:56] and we come to find out that the people
[14:58] who believe in grace the Calvinists they
[15:01] say bless God it don't hurt me to smoke
[15:04] it don't hurt me to drink I can do these
[15:07] things I've got eternal security
[15:11] then we find the other side on the legal
[15:13] he said oh I would like to ball him out
[15:16] I'd like to show him a piece of my mind
[15:18] but I'm a Christian I have to keep still
[15:21] see you find yourself
[15:24] on two different roads and neither one
[15:28] of them is right now that's hard to say
[15:30] that
[15:31] but it is the truth
[15:33] we find ourselves on two different roads
[15:37] one going one way one another
[15:40] now let's see what truth is
[15:44] now listen and see if this sounds
[15:46] sensible to you
[15:48] for instance if I get ready go overseas
[15:51] I'll take my own family
[15:54] I'll call my wife up to me and I will
[15:57] say uh we're go I'm going overseas dear
[16:01] now here is the legalist sign
[16:04] now my wife I'm going to lay the law
[16:07] down to you if you flirt with any man
[16:10] while I'm gone
[16:12] when I come back you're a divorced woman
[16:16] and I don't want you making eyes don't
[16:18] want you flirting
[16:19] you understand that I'm your husband if
[16:21] you do it I'm going to put you away you
[16:23] want to come back
[16:24] then she reaches and gets me by the time
[16:27] say my good man I want to tell you
[16:28] something
[16:31] that if you make eyes with any woman or
[16:33] take any woman out or flirt with any
[16:35] woman you're going to be a divorced man
[16:37] when you come back I wouldn't that be a
[16:39] happy home
[16:40] that's the legalism
[16:43] all right
[16:44] now the other side is that if I go
[16:48] overseas and uh make a mistake
[16:52] go over and say when I look I'll take
[16:54] this woman out oh it's all right
[16:58] [Music]
[17:15] foreign
[17:19] [Music]
