three are guided in your name there you are in their midst and father for your children to defy the weather to be here tonight there must be something in them driving them father we have not come as spectators we Are Witnesses of what our Lord and our God is doing in this day and age and for us to come together father tonight father oh God we are here tonight father for a purpose that we may

your seven brother one he just called and he said they were on their way to church father will lift your servant into your hands tonight Lord if he has called and he has responded father we pray that you will be there to see him true that you would use him to be a blessing for the minister through him father to the people father we pray that you would glorify yourself in him and in his ministry father oh God we humbly beseech your father tonight may you come and take your place in tonight's service a Jesus name amen praise God bless you musicians that will be all for now God bless your sins shall be seated for just a minute God bless you all for coming it's always heartwarming to know that everybody is this is just trying out their best in one way or the other um to keep the Flames burning praise be to God um oh sis um says Alice you're warmly welcome I think since you came back we've not seen you yet God bless you um yeah brother Jordan it was nice to see you I've known since his fate but you guys are warmly well backed uh warmly um warmly welcome uh who else am I missing okay praise be to God God bless you Reverend Reese happy to have you back tonight God bless you all Saints yes so as I said brother one called me just a while ago and his sense is great like we are starting a little earlier than them so remember him in your prayers um he confess your prayers praise be to God and there is a praise report here from sis Kelly um since Kelly wants to say thank you for the church praying for the brother-in-law he is doing well and will be discharged to go home soon praise God for answering our prayers our God is a prayer answering God there is no prayer God has not answered you may be wondering what I'm what I'm talking about and I say it again there is no prayer God has not answered God has answered every single prayer now we have our definition I don't even know where I'm going with this praise be to God we have our definition for an answered prayer that when we pray for something and we see it also God has answered the prayer but if it does not happen in the way we were expecting it then God has not answered it but I'm here to tell you tonight that God answers every single prayer now the beautiful thing about prayer is that when you pray God will change the circumstances or God will leave the circumstances the way they are the very thing you are running away from the very thing you want God to take away from you God will live it and it will be staring at you in the face and you'll be prayed and prayed and praying and you'll be asking yourself why God is not answering the prayer God has answered that prayer guess what he is using that very circumstances to work on you we can talk about Paul hey he prayed and prayed and prayed and wished that God had taken I mean he wasn't seen well in his eyes and God never took it away God told him my grace is sufficient for you and brother Brown would tell us that God used that to work on Paul to Humble him so God answers every single prayer praise be to God as I was seated in the pastor's office just getting ready to come over a few things just came on my mind and um I just jotted them down because they were not part of it says every service just remember that our sacrifices would never go in vain whatever sacrifices you are making for the kingdom of God would never be in vain driving through the snow through the call to come to church that even when you are not able to make it to church and you are home you still want to log in and to be part of the service when you could be flipping channels that is in case if you have a television at home or maybe doing something else but you want to be part of the service all the same even though you are not present here your sacrifices would never be in vain every service takes you a step closer praise be to God every devotion takes you a step closer every Bible verse takes you a step closer and never get weary in your work with God never get tired of course we are making sacrifices but between us and the Lord who made the most sacrifice praise be to God so once again God bless you all for coming and if you can just stand for the reading of the word I would appreciate it if for any reason you can't stand you can be you can remain seated praise God shall we open our Bibles to Isaiah 50 uh sorry Isaiah 21 Isaiah 21. and I'm reading from verse 1 to 12. Isaiah 21 1-12 that is going to be a long reading I guess feel like calling somebody over here praise be to God let me Inspire him for this time the bedding of the the desert of the sea as World winds in the South pass through so it coming from the desert from a terrible land a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealth the treacherous deal let me take that again a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous with me I take that again praise the Lord verse two agreement's vision is declared unto me that freshness dealer dealers treacherously and the spoilers pull it go up Elam besiege oh media all the sign that off have I made to cease therefore are my loins filled with pain s have taken hold upon me as a part of a woman that traveleth I was bowed down at the hearing of it I was dismayed at the scene of it my heart panted fearfully afraided me the night of my pleasure have he turned into fear unto me prepare the table watch in the Watchtower eat drink arise yeah princess and anoint The Shield for for thus have the Lord said unto me go set a Watchman let him declare what he seeth and he saw a chariot with a couple of Horsemen a chariot of asses and a chariot of camels and he working diligently with his Heat with much heat and he cried a lion my Lord I stand continually upon the Watchtower in the daytime and I am set in my word whole night and behold here cometh a chariot of men with a couple of horse men and he answered and said Babylon is falling is falling and all The Grieving images of her Gods he have broken onto the ground oh my attraction and the corn of my flaw that which I have heard of The Lord of hosts the god of Israel have I declared unto you the burden of demon he calleth to me out of CA Watchman one of the night Watchman word of the night The Watchman answered the Watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquire inquiry return come praise be to God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word shall we be seated praise be to God I just felt the need for us to encourage ourselves tonight this is a sermon that the prophet of God preached in 1958 and I just looked at it and I thought today being Wednesday uh on a Wednesday evening like this uh we could use this for um as a steady Bible study and I just encourage ourselves now he titled the message Watchman what of the night so we are just going to encourage ourselves tonight with portions of this world Watchman what of the night now without a doubt we are living in the most unprecedented time of human history it is nights Watchman what of the night it is night time not only is it night but it is dark not only is it dark it is Pitch Black the darkest moment in human history we are living in it and there is a lot that is going on because it is dark look at morals the moral decay the moral Decay that has swapped the Earth surface that men have become so corrupt so morally decayed so rotten so filthy that Humanity has sunk so low Humanity cannot go any lower because we have hit rock bottom there is no no more there's no more place to go that is how filthy it is that men want to become women want to become men so much confusion in the schools you send your kid to school and you think their case and they come back hmm right and they are not the kids you know why because the educational system think that a child that age should be taught something that is adult content and even some of the teachers don't feel comfortable teaching that but they teach it because it is part of the curriculum there was a lady that was fired because of that there is so much moral decay so much rottenness and so much filth that is how dark and convoluted the world we are living in today is no wonder the other day China was making fun of us China said only 26 percent of American males are eligible to be enlisted into the army and guess what reason they gave they said because the men have all become uh transgenders no it was this by it is so rotten that instead of hiding this evil they can come out they have their death to celebrate and they are in their colors and their streets for the world to see them Lord have mercy and they are breaking homes left right and Senna this world has become so so corrupt we are living in the darkest moment of human history it couldn't be worse than Western it is today and the churches have let the people down their people are not told the truth so much so that two men can walk to a church or two women can walk to a church and the pastor will bless their Union what a shame why is the position of the church we don't tell the people the truth we make them to feel it's all right it's okay and what we do we toy with the salvation of the people and once your salvation is begin is being toyed with your Eternal destination is stored with any day could be the day if you listen to news you can tell sometimes when you are going to bed I am not talking of us here because we have a hope and eternal God [Music] we are expecting that to happen so if it happens tonight it's not going to be by surprise we are not going to be taken by surprise we are expecting it to happen but there are a lot of people that are going to be overtaken by surprise news and you are going to bed sometimes you'll be wondering which side of the bed you'll be waking up from the following morning because there is so much so much pressure that's not even the word I want to use so much chaos with with Russia China uh North Korea coming together against America and her allies and they keep threatening and these are nuclear Nations they keep threatening to deploy their nuclear arsenals against the U.S and her allies and they keep talking about it over and over one day will be the day they will just press the button mm-hmm it just takes a second for somebody to press the button because they have just talked about it way too much it is night time watch man what of the night Watchman what of the night now in fact um in in in turkey and Syria there was an earthquake there was an earthquake now just look at this when they woke up that morning it was another day the sun rose from the East see his color the wind was just blowing as usual the trees were just dancing as usual people went to work people went out they had fun people just went about their daily activities everything was normal there was no trumpet in the skies saying that something is going to happen watch out don't sleep in your homes today go to the forest and sleep that may be funny but if they had all gone to the forest probably driving better everything was normal they went to bed everything was normal they had their plans this is what I'm going to do tomorrow this is what I'll do next month this is what I'll do next year in 10 years is what I want to be 100 years is what I want to be and they had all their plans very well said they went to bed and they expected that things were going to be the same the following morning but earthquake struck and guess what the earthquake lasted only 45 seconds 45 seconds less than one minute this is why you would know that it doesn't take much to change a month 's life 45 seconds and in 45 seconds I don't know that no they've told now the last time I checked probably four or five days ago it was 50 000. and they are still counting those cities of turkey and Syria and Syria just in 45 seconds became a slum in 45 seconds that beauty that building those High strippers became a slum it was played with Darkness in 45 seconds orphans were made in 45 seconds widows were made in 45 seconds widowers were made in 45 seconds people lost their entire life savings their entire life Investments everything they ever struggled for went down the drains right what is the value of life without Christ what is the is the without Christ in your life your life first the kingdom and all other things shall be added unto you put your materialities ahead of God praise be to God in 45 seconds the situation changed completely irreversibly completely done I don't know whether that is English please be to God in 45 seconds and guess what when all the other countries in the world that will send um Aid send Aid send man onto the field rescue us with their rescue dogs guess what they didn't go looking for gold they were not going there to sign these nice deals they were not going down on Excursion they were going there for one thing to look for Souls it tells you how important your life is how we ought to love one another how we ought to love one another put all those all those two small things behind us and let's just forge afford ahead with one common purpose praise be to God and there is one picture that has just stuck with me that a little girl a little girl probably the age publish is about maybe maybe three years Maybe a little girl this girl was taken out of the rubble she couldn't even cry anymore she may have cried and cried and cried and cried taken out of the rebel by a complete stranger a complete stranger and I would expect a girl that age to look at this man in the face and start crying because he's never seen this man from Adam and then the girl looks at the man in his face like this and then she pushed her head on his shoulder praise be to God in 45 seconds now as I was talking about it as I was thinking about it I started thinking I said what if there was somebody that night that was spoken to give your life to Christ give your life to Christ and the person was convicted to do it and said to himself you know I am still young let me wait till I am old oh you know um I can do it another time I don't have to do it now oh is that we give myself time let me enjoy my youth what does it mean to say you want to enjoy your youth without Christ there is no enjoyment you put your life on the line like that and they said no I'll wait and do it tomorrow or next week or next month or when I'm 20 years or when I'm 100 years and that night that happened they never stood the chance that is why the Bible says that this day tomorrow not when you hear the voice of God hardly not your heart hiding not your hearts we don't come to church for the fun of it we don't just come just go he's just trying to let me no you come with a purpose there is something on your heart you want more of God that is why we are here we want to be talk to you we want God to talk to us and in every single service make sure you take something out of it in every single service make sure you are taking something out of their service when you open your bible to read make sure you are taking something out of it if it's a morning devotion even in devotion I don't care if it is five seconds of 10 minutes make sure you get something out of it praise be to God we are living in the darkest moment of human history tomorrow waits for no man don't wait for tomorrow I'm not saying tomorrow will not come tomorrow may not come that's what I'm saying but don't wait for it what you can do today do it today praise be to God watch man word of the nights who is a Watchman by the way in those days they will build their cities and they will work around it just for the security of the people and that wasn't enough they are going to raise a tower and the car is always higher than the the city walls and in that Tower they will put a Watchman The Watchman was not just a novice he was not just any person they didn't go down the street somewhere and they catch somebody said you are just going to be here no because they knew the importance of the Watchmen that the lives of the people in the city depended on what the Watchman would say praise be to God so they put somebody of integrity somebody that had an understanding of the heavenly bodies because the Watchman sat in that Tower and he heard with him a book of astronomy yes and when somebody comes out of the night and he cries out Watchman one of the night the prayer of God says that the Watchman will just look at the stars and then tell that person what time of the day it is and the person goes back to bed Watchman he was not just anybody a special person and what was the duty of the Watchman his duty was to tell the people the time of the day one of the night starts he loses his book as of astronomy oh it's 4 am in the morning so you know how close you are to Daybreak not just the time so you know how close you are to Daybreak and not only that he was also supposed to warn the people of oncoming Danger that he sat on the tower and he had a full 360 degree View around the city that if he saw anything coming maybe horses and chariots just coming towards the city with a dust billowing he will just sound his trumpet and when the people hear that trumpet they know that this is a sound for war and they just go in and they meet the enemy house outside so they don't they don't they don't just sit down and the enemy comes in and takes them on away and Brennan said that when the Watchman sees anything and does not tell the people and the enemy comes in and overtake the city God is going to require their blood from his hands that is how it is how the Watchman is that the lives of the people depended on what the Watchman sees and what the Watchman says and those who know they are Watchmen don't take things for granted now when the Washburn sells the alarm they don't go in and lock the door and sleep because they know there is danger coming they'll come from the danger that is a Watchman and that is the duty of a Watchman praise be to God and those who know their Watchmen praise be to God as I said they don't play with what he says and that is the way we esteem our Prophets and esteem his ministry and we don't joke with anything the prophet of God has said because we know it is between life and death but brother says that the prophets of God are Watchmen and they are likened unto Eagles and we know as we have heard the story over and over an eagle is just an eagle not like any other bird like a prophet of God not any ordinary human being like he said in this message that the people who don't go and take our Iron Man to go and sit on the tower oh they will not take somebody who is short-sighted to go and sit on that Tower because they know the importance of the Watchmen so it's not just inner body right and the promise of God are not just any bodies when you read the book of Jeremiah 1 5 God was telling Jeremiah that before he was born he was ordained he knew him and he ordained him a prophet they are God chosen vessels and these are men that can go into the inner mind of God and bring to the people the mind of God they'll go to the inner cause of God and they bring to the people that sayeth the Lord they tell you what it is and the way it is they don't sugarcoat the word of God to make you feel comfortable with it so you can swallow it and feel comfortable no they just give it to you the way it is men that are prepared men that are chosen of God with that task and the prophets of God our Watchmen and like the eagles the Father the eagle goes in the skies the father it sees like the word the worst part on the tower see father and the prayer of God says God has given His prophets those spiritual eyes and they can see the forests far beyond any human being can see far beyond what the carnal eyes can see and what they see they declare it to the people now when the prophet of God who is our Watchman sees something and he declares it praise be to God like my brother has said over and over he is obligated to tell you the truth to give you the word but he is not obligated to what you do with it that is in your hands The Watchman is obligated to sound a warning to tell you there is danger coming you can decide to take it or you can decide to forget it but he has sounded a warning he has done his work now the ball is in your court what you do with it what you do with it depends on you we have the truth we have the truth God is so gracious time will not permit us but I can tell you from being a Catholic to a Muslim and through all those religions African traditional religion and all those things there was something in me that was not satisfied and I kept looking for something if you ask me brother what are you looking for to tell you the truth I couldn't tell you what I was looking for but I was looking for something I have told the story a thousand times already praise be to God is going to be Thousand and One today praise the Lord I didn't know what I was looking for I just didn't know but I knew I was looking for something and praise be to God that night when I heard the true word praise be to God I said to myself this is what I've been looking for all these years praise be to God this is what I've been looking for all these years and at the time I didn't even know that God has sent a prophet on to us I didn't know it was when I started visiting then I realized that oh so God has sent us a prophet and his name is William Branham who is this man then another Barrel started praise be to God God would never leave his children in Arrow I don't care what anybody says about the prophet I don't care what anybody says about the message one thing I can say for a fact that this message has made me a better person through I used to fear death man I don't fear death anymore as a matter of fact death yes me praise the Lord death is just a vehicle once upon a time it was so terrible to think about dying when they talk of death but you know it's just a vehicle that transports you from this natural into it across the divide into the presence of God I don't fear death in any case God has delivered me from Death countless number of times I can't count to tell you the truth what I can personally count maybe maybe five or six but out of everyone I believe there are three or four I didn't know about so that tells me that a day you guys hear I have no more I don't care what is 100 feet or 20 feet or three miles or three kilometers down the ocean if you don't get to see me again by the grace of God on that day when that family of God shall be sounded we will meet there in the skies okay praise be to God yes I can hear somebody saying hmm praise the Lord yeah yeah that's that's my baby girl and uh um again she's my mother yes I know when she's a baby girl and I know when she turns into her mother praise the Lord yes where are we sorry the prophets of God as we said we are eagles they are Watchmen and they see father than we see and what they see they declare it to us and that should arm you that should get you prepared because you know that the enemy is on the way and you are meeting the enemy head on praise be to God the prayer of God said that Jesus Christ himself what's a Watchman the king of eagles the king of eagles and that just before he's going away he spoke more about his second coming than he did in his going away praise be to God he was a Watchman now look at Jesus with his disciples telling them about how the temple was going to be destroyed how one stone will not be left sitting on the other and this may be wondering what is he talking about talking about earthquakes like we just talked about talking about wars talking about rumors of wars talking about moral Decay everything we are talking about today he talked about it whilst he was on this Earth's surface he was a Watchman the king of the Eagles and the days he foretold we are living in an age where we are seeing them being fulfilled we are seeing them with our very own eyes said that there was a great question and what was it Jesus knew he was going to die so it was not a question about whether he was going to die or not he knew that time of death he was going to die that he was going to die on the cross so that was not the question he knew that he was going to be buried so that was not a question and he knew that he was going to rise again there was no question about it because he had a Father's Promise that I would not leave a Holy One yes neither would I leave his soul in hell [Music] so he had the promise of the father so that was not a question and he knew that the Holy Ghost was going to come there was no question about that beverage said that there was a great question and let me read that here praise be to God the question was would there be any faith left on Earth at his coming all right will there be faith when he comes will he find people who believes his word will there be any faith at his coming would he come and still find people that are believing his word that are standing for the word that will do anything for the world that are prepared to give their lives for the word would he come and meet a people still standing for the truth that was the great question that was the great question we have heard the word of God time and again God has not left us in error if there are any that are perishing is not any of us because we know the truth what do you do with the word when the word comes to you what do you do I think somewhere down there I have a few things to be touching on so let me just um time I'm just a few minutes away will be fine by the grace of God and now [Music] there is an oncoming Danger no man has the solution the Pentagon has no solution to it FBI has no solution to it they're more sad they don't have a solution to it the KGB doesn't know the solution there is no country in the world you as a mayor Russia mentioned them no country has the solution the prophet of God says who has the answer The Watchman has the answer The Watchman is the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit is the Watchman who is warning the people of what the oncoming Danger and Isaiah says and the night the morning is coming but the Night Comes First just before they break it turns darker than ever before the approaching light that makes it darker is the coming of the Lord that has made things darker the morning is coming for those who are prepared for the morning and the Knights is there for those who are not prepared for the morning so if you are prepared for the morning there is a morning coming for you but if you are not prepared for the morning then you have the darkness to contend with it just to read something here very real quick from the from the message uh on my phone it was paragraph 67 to 71 um watch how scriptural Isaiah was when he said Watchman one of the night he said the morning cometh and the night also what the morning comes by the Night comes before the morning what was it anyone knows that just before the breakup day just at the hours of the approaching day a tense darker than ever than it ever was oh my friends listening to that say yes the Lord if you consider me to be his servant is just before Daybreak praise be to God that is why this horrible Gloom is over the Earth is just before the coming of the Lord Jesus there is no more hope left ain't nothing but his coming nations are against Nations as we can see and they have food through God's Laboratory till they've got the power to blow one another into Atomic ashes can you imagine what will happen today because the U.S and Russia both have I think 95 or 96 percent of the world's nuclear Arsenal the rest of the countries just have small small but Russia and U.S control about 95 or 96 but U.S is the lead U.S has the most can you imagine if Russia makes a mistake and presses the button U.S is not going to sit down U.S is going to also press and China will press and that boy in North Korea will also press can you imagine what is going to happen on this Earth surface now say that the world has enough nuclear arsenals to to destroy this Earth several times over not once not twice several times over they have enough nuclear bombs to do that job it just takes one one person to start and the rest will follow suit that is how close how close we have come and by the time we get to the end of the service probably the picture will be clearer and they they are wicked and and they are already and they are on on christ-like and the only motive they have and objective is to destroy and they are inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire this man let me say in the name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit has sent us a Watchman on the tower and as the people cry what of the night you are weary of this life are you weary of this life the problem of God is asking are you weary of this life or you still want to stay here it reminds me of the story in the Dark Ages why the Christians they killed them and killed them and killed them they couldn't kill them anymore and they just made that bonfire they dug a hole with fire and they were just pushing them in the Creator will just walk into it willingly willingly praise be to God now guess what even though they were working and jumping into the fire there was something God hid from them but can you imagine the soldiers that were there to make sure these guys perished there was a soldier that when a man jumps into the fire all he sees is the man's Soul going up into the heaven and it goes to this man and the man probably didn't want to go he still wanted to enjoy the Earth are you weary of this life are you weary are you tired of this life this man wanted to go and the soldier asked him you don't want to go the man was dragging his feet the Sawyer took his uniform and gave it to him and he jumped in I pray God will open our eyes to see I pray God will take the scales off our eyes so we can see praise be to God wherever you find yourself yeah we can look at our chest it's not because of what we are able to do we can do nothing on our own as someone said that the most beautiful and the most glorious things about our lives have nothing to do with us but everything to do with God is what God has done we ought to be so grateful to the almighty God I don't know about you but when I look behind me I can see where God took me from amen God Is So changing lives he said Breaking Chains he is the chain breaker any time could be the day I'm just a few minutes away praise Beauty God oh my I think we'll be good the money coming um are you weary of this life are you weary of sin are you wearing your funeral processions and sickness and ungodliness on every hand has the night been so long and weary what of the night Watchman he said the morning cometh see the comfort to know that even though you are going through the night even though you are going through trying times even though you are going through the headwind even though you are going through the problems sometimes as a matter of fact you can find yourself in the eye of the storm but then you can still feel the hand of God what a paradox but it is always true I believe you guys know what I'm talking about what the night look look how in in perfect harmony with the scripture Isaiah was in the regular course of nature always that the approaching of the Sun congeals the darkness together and makes it dark it's darker before it's darker before day than any time in the night why is the approaching light that that's making it dark and is the approaching of the Lord Jesus now that's bringing this Gloom upon the Earth did not he say when these things begin to come to pass lift up your head for your Redemption is drawing night so when you look at these things in the way they are happy you know the things that are going on it tells one thing that the coming of the Lord is very close at hand and if you know the coming of the Lord is very close at hand it tells what you do with your life you don't want the Lord to come and meet you in a place where he would not go you don't want the Lord to come and meet you doing something he would not do you want him to come and meet you prepared and when you know he's coming he's very close you are checking every single move you don't take this for granted you don't go with the flow it's just you and God if there was any time we ought to be praying it's now if there was any time we ought to take our prayers very seriously it's now I'm going to squeeze all this thing um we'll be fine um what is what is brother brother Hitler his brother his wife is here so I know he's around praise the Lord so there is only one great light before Daybreak and that's the Morning Star it gets brighter as the Earth gets darker and darker the morning light is reflecting the light of the Sun and at this point the prophet of God says that the other stars begin to dim when the other stars begin to dim that is when the Morning Star begins to shine brighter and brighter and the prayer of God says modern Stars rise and shine to the glory of God those who love God those who have the morning Stars light they um they are getting their eyes on him and after things of the world lift up your head once again for your Redemption is nigh praise be to God there is a total annihilation coming to the world but before the church before then before that total Annihilation the Church of Christ will be raptured to meet her Lord with all the unrest it could be any day with all the unrest it could be any day I'm going to speed up now so we are set with a message to prepare us that is a warning that there is an and an oncoming danger there is a danger approaching and we ought to be preparing ourselves we ought to be getting ourselves ready now just keep feeding on the word it's the word that changes your nature nothing else can do it do not let anything come between you and the word the word as a matter of facts is the strongest weapon that God ever gave men look at it when the Lord Jesus fasted 40 days and 40 nights and the devil came to attempt him what did he use he used the word he used his best Arsenal he used his best weapon and that was his word for there is nothing that is greater than the word of God in the beginning was the word the word was it God and the Word was God there is nothing that can defeat the Devil but God he used the word so we are giving the best Arsenal the best we are giving the best and the devil fears you when you are living by the word the devil doesn't bear it doesn't fear your prayer life if your life is crooked if you are living an ungodly life the devil doesn't have time for you you can pray for money till evening the devil can just come and sit there and look you finish praying and then he'll jump on you the only thing that scares the devil is the word is the word the Bible says they overcame by the words of their testimony praise be to God when you are living by the word you take in the word of God you are living by the word when the Devil comes he doesn't see you he sees God the word is so powerful as the Bible says that the word of God is quick and Powerful it's a scripture I love so much of the Soul and Spirit and of the Joyce and Marrow and he said he said of the person enters of the heart there is nothing that crushes the devil more than the word of God and as a matter of fact for you to live by the wife is a rebuke to the devil because the devil is telling people all over the world that nobody can live by the word so when you appear and you are living by the word the devil looks at you and he's ashamed of you there is so much power and authority in the word of God and when your life is right that is why the Bible says that the fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much and What Makes You righteous it's not your good works our righteousness is by faith amen when you are living by the word your prayer is very effective very effective why because the Life Is Right and if there is any time you ought to be praying is today but you can never have an effective prayer life if your life is not right we have a place to go I'm just here to remind ourselves that we have a place to go that one of these days it will all be over that we are living a darkest point of human history and one of these days it will all be over there is a place in his arms of love for every one of us How He Loves Us God loves us he loves us so much more than you think more than you would ever think more than you would ever imagine people who can understand the love of God don't look at you look at his word praise be to God yes the musicians can come over as I laid down my so as I said it was just an opportunity you know to straighten ourselves up if there is anything to straighten in our lives um God is working on us without a doubt God is working on us there is no doubt about it but you have to submit yourself in total times completely into his hands and let God work on you and the Highlight for me tonight is that do not take the word for granted do you know let it be something you can just hop in today and hoping and hop out tomorrow the Bible says here that puts his son to the plow and turns back it's not worthy of me God pays business with you and God wants you to mend business with him [Music] it's a relationship between you and God praise be to God just live by the word let the word of God take effect in your life that wherever you find yourself the word in you would create an atmosphere [Music] get the Holy Ghost father is only one body that is going in the rapture and that is the body of Christ there is nobody that is going on their own Merit no you are not going on your own merits [Music] there is only one body and that is the body of Christ and we are all part we are all members of this body for the Bible says by one spirits and we were placed into one body if you do not have the Holy Ghost ask God for it ask God for the holy ghosts Matthew 7 and I believe Luke 11 10 thereabouts says that what father is there his son would ask for fish and he will give him a snake I will ask for bread and you give him a stone I don't care how Wicked a father is he will never do that and the Bible says if you've been evil know how to give Glory gifts unto your children how would a Heavenly Father give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him for ask for the Holy Ghost When you pray ask for the Holy Ghost because the Bible says today after ask they receive he does he can find it and to him that knock the door shall be opened it's a promise and God has promised us how he's going to pour the spirit Upon Our flesh in the Book of Joel praise be to God by what spirits are we baptized into one body we are all members parts of that same body that is why we want to make sure that we are not living together and fighting together praise be to God just want to thank the almighty God for this opportunity and I want us to go to God In Prayer [Music] world will not go out and return void I know and I believe that God has spoken to you tonight and I wanted to talk to God
