about a consolation this morning amen luke chapter 2. let's read from verse 33. verse 33 uh we can we can drop back a little bit uh verse 25 verse 25 and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devote waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him now i want for us to to to to watch these things now this man simeon he was waiting for the consolation of israel the holy ghost was upon him too it was revered unto him by the holy ghost so he had a revelation that he should not see death praise the lord is that not a rapture promise is that not a rapture condition yes it is amen that he will not see death praise the lord before he have seen the lost christ wow and he came by the spirit into the temple i hope you are led here by the holy ghost this morning amen because if you are layered by the holy ghost i'm promising you you will see the lord christ amen you will not see the man but you will see the lord christ because he promised wherever two or three are gathered he will be there in our midst and he came by the by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought brother child that's meredith joseph brother child jesus to do unto him after the custom of the lord then took he him up in his arms and bless god and say lord now let that seven depart in peace i call into the word yes you know when i was reading this last night uh uh studying i thought in my mind even if as as as kovac has taken many of of of the saints they die in peace if we have to go by the grave we will go in peace if we are going by the rapture we will go in peace because our eyes have seen the salvation of the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah amen hallelujah then he then he took him up in his arm he blessed god and said lord now let us seven depart in peace i call into that word a believer can only go i call into the word of the lord that's what david says is is it's a pleasure the death of the saint is is pleasure is pleasant unto the lord because we can only go by calling to the word of the lord amen amen amen thank you jesus thank you jesus for my eyes have seen their salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people let us pray father come lord help help us this morning we all need your help lord for the most that we need is to be able to hear from you this morning come lord we have read from your word we asking the lord you coming and break the seal lord break the oh god take the veil oh god from over your word this morning oh god and let christ be released to the people because we know the opening of the word is the releasing of christ oh god i pray this morning father lord jesus come lord comfort us this morning in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen thank you jesus glory be to god amen what a wonderful jesus we serve yes amen he's a faithful god for he never failed amen he never failed praise the lord so just like i said this morning just for a little uh encouragement uh uh for a message of comfort this morning and all we've been uh we've been we've been poaching ourselves by the world this morning looking in every aspect of our life and uh but i fell in my heart this morning to bring you some encouragement from the lord amen praise the lord to bring you because the bride has a consolation praise the lord our consolation is not in no political party amen so because whether it is a republican or whether it is democrat is all rotting apples you just have to choose which one you want to eat praise the lord so our our consolation is not in the government either praise the lord amen whether the governor of this state or their state is not in no government our consolation is not even in the church our consolation is in god's promise for this hour praise the lord our consolation is in god's promise for this hour praise the lord amen amen just like paul said in the book of hebrew there is a rest that is promised to the people of god amen and just like just like sarah sarah had to laugh in her in her life she lied the first time when the angels said i call into the time of life sarah will concede she laughed praise the lord amen but we know that the first life was more of a doubt in life a life of being skeptical me being an old woman where i have a child praise the lord amen but then she had a second left and when she left god life and everybody around her life praise the lord when she had a second left the heavens laughed and everybody that was around her have you ever experienced that somebody's laughing you don't know what they're laughing about and praise the lord everybody in the house laughing and then the neighbors year it in oh my goodness praise the lord that was sarah's second life and i believe there is a laughter that is awaiting us there is a laughter that is waiting us amen glory be to god so we want to talk about the bride consolation this morning i want to trust and pray that the lord the holy spirit will help us and bring blessing out of the word this morning praise the lord amen amen glory be to god while we were we were traveling well listening to this tape uh the reproach for the cost of the world and uh uh while listening to it i kind of picked this up i want to i want to read that uh pick this up see what a little betty church there was praise the lord see what a little bitty church amen did i say my noteback thing okay i know what i did i know exactly what i did i positioned it but i did not send it i did not press send brother one it does not go like that you gotta press sin he got a present when am i going to learn when am i going to learn when i'm going to learn praise the lord okay let's go ahead so this thought caught my mind while i was listening to dad yesterday and uh uh talking about you know the the birth of jesus and uh and and just to see and that's that's what i want to bring to you this morning is is in the comfort to see at the first coming of the lord praise the lord at the first coming of the lord jesus there were just few people now i'm talking about believers now praise the lord i'm talking about believers you can count the wise men and then there are other people that were also involved there were other people that god dealt with during that time but when it comes to the believers the ones that were believing the ones that were you know worshipping god the god of abraham and isaac the one that were following the commandments of the torah there were just few just very few that god dealt with in the first coming of the lord and it's not going to be anything different in this coming of the lord praise the lord amen see what a little better church there was it was zacharias elizabeth mary and joseph anna simeon praise the lord it was just those six the shepherds on the hill praise the lord and even the baby john in his mother's womb praise the lord i have a place for every one of them this morning and we'll just we trust that the lord will be able to to uh to bless us a little better church there was zechariah's married anna simeon six out of a million like the days of noah praise the lord six of them god dead with every one of them every one of them every one of those six individuals with the shepherds on the hill the shepherds uh are seven but uh uh uh i'll come back to them all of those six individuals god dared with them individually praise the lord amen and yeah you remember the the testimony about uh the danger in the neighborhood praise the lord after the revival meeting when brother brandon prayed for that woman with the water and and prayed for the other lady and uh uh and they went home that morning and uh and just in the same time that other lady you know received her healing you know shouting on on the hill then and this other woman also received and and you know uh uh all of these things they are not just story to make you to believe uh uh brother branham no it's not about believing brother branham is believing that jesus christ is the same yesterday to them forever because you were realized here that during the the the the coming of the law the first coming of the law the angel gabriel was visiting that neighborhood the same angel that spoke to zacharias yes was the same angel that spoke to mary it was the same angel that spoke to joseph by night yes praise the lord amen so angers visit the neighborhood [Music] when they come down in an area and and and and brings a blessing there i mean the the the move to all the hearts that is that is that is desiring an experience from god praise the lord amen so there were there were only six or we would say seven you know uh uh but it was it was just a little group it was a new group of people that that experience they had an experience they had they had a consolation there was something that happened to them comforting for them to be able to de-wave the hour that they were living in praise the lord amen now so you see that this first coming of the lord it was a coming just like the church is awaiting the coming of the lord and and but the thing about it that this church as we think about the coming of the lord is more in a sense we think about our going away praise the lord amen we think about our goal in a way and that is the thing that has put the church in the kind of a scoffing condition praise the lord it has put the church in a kind of a scoffing condition because by scripture we know the coming of the lord the the the the the completeness of the coming of the law will be our goal in the way but our going away is not the coming of the law there is a coming amen the bible says in a moment movement is a time period the lord himself shall descend with a shout the voice of the archangel and the trump of god so it's all the process of his coming are we together amen now so just like in his first coming all of these people experienced the coming of the lord to prepare them for the hour of his first coming they all experienced the coming of the lord even john the baptist experienced it in his mother's womb so it makes provision for the little ones amen it makes provision structural provision for the little ones that's why we must keep them in that atmosphere praise the lord because if john in his mother warm experienced the coming of the lord just by the mention of jesus christ i believe that just by the mention of his name elizabeth said just by the mention the baby leave for joy praise the lord if the baby in the mother womb will leave for joy by the mention of his name was about our little ones glory be to god amen amen praise the lord it's like i kind of forget something here and now my my notes have turned into chinese writing praise the lord i have a handwriting on the wall and we need a daniel to interpret it praise the lord glory be to god amen are we together now so yeah and and and the beautiful thing there also look at it now look at this rapture setting let me let me say it to you like this because our consolation our uh coming of the law that we are waiting for is the rapture but look at this rapture setting how beautiful it is god visited zacharias god visited a family a man and his wife praise the lord amen now they they i mean they marry us as as young sweetheart live all their lives together never had a time but that was not a requirement for god's visitation praise the lord people called elizabeth byron but god still visited her praise the lord and she experienced the visitation of god in one of the most glorious hour what does that reveal that there will even be couples that will be going through difficult time in their life but they will be steadfast in faith and in this rapture in our god will visit him praise the lord whether visiting them with child or whatever visiting them by the divine healing and what the the the concept here is that our physical body condition does not stop god from visiting us when our faith is right when our heart is right amen praise the lord the bible says hannah was a blind woman but yes she could see more than the high priest praise the lord because she saw the coming of the lord she was a blind woman she did not have a physical eye but yes she could see and all the ones that were using specks so it shows that in this coming of the law that we are in some of god's children will be having health problems but it does not handle your faith praise the lord don't let the devil use your health situation to handle your faith glory be to god oh i love this one mary and joseph they were planning their wedding they were now married they were not couples so god is showing a rapturing condition that right in that time of the rapture people will be planning waiting they will be dating there will be you know everything you'll be in cold shape and all of that but you see it also shows that no matter what you foresee we know america was just a young virgin girl she had the same young emotion that all of you young girls have yes praise the lord she was thinking about who am i mean she was thinking about when will my wedding be she was thinking about all of that but her heart was right if her heart was not in the right place the angel would not visit her the angel never came because she wanted to get married the angel came because the word says a virgin shall conceive that's right amen amen yes praise the lord oh joseph was under he was on the other man he lost his wife yes he had to raise his children by himself and he was thinking about you know having another wife again but the bible said he was a just man he was a just man oh glory be to god glory be to god right in the time of this coming of the lord there will still be just men there will still be men who hearts are right men who are still standing for the truth standing for righteousness standing for clean living hallelujah yes there will still be men that will still be women that will stand for the value of the world praise the lord amen don't blame facebook because they have their own facebook in the other day your own has just modified itself that you can put it in your pocket now all that all yours have done it has just become a smart demon that you can put in your pocket praise the lord amen but as the son of god as a daughter of god we've been given power to control every demon so whether i put it in my pocket is under control i must keep it under control i must not allow that demon to control my mind and abuse my mind and my spirit i must keep it under control because i'm a son of god praise the lord oh i love it when the wonder when the when the scripture becomes so beautiful like this she was a young teenage girl thinking about life praise the lord amen well her heart was right solomon said your heart is the issue of life don't defy it don't corrupt your heart joseph was going through his own problem but he was a just man and he was glad to find mary a young woman still glad to find a virgin in nazareth because nazareth was one of the most fatigued city but he was glad to find the virgin in the coming of the lord in the coming of the lord he was glad to find the virgin are we together amen and it went about planning everything you know and and talking on the phone well you say they didn't have phone those days but they had a way they were sending messages across praise the lord amen joseph high is capital shop neighbor will always want to go in the market amen she will always want to go in the market because she knew she would have to stop by and talk a little bit praise the lord when he said coke she said i'm not feeling too well i can go shopping but it was in the coming of the lord and here we have blonde hannah separated from her husband praise the lord her husband died when she was just a young young girl and she just dedicated the rest of her life to serve the lord and faithfulness you would think you would think you would think that this woman dedicated her life says i mean i mean god should just bless her i mean i mean is it a difficult thing for god to just bless her with good health let her just enjoy her days but yes she became blind praise the lord but you see her blindness did not affect her faith it did not affect her faith and make her more stronger waiting for the consolation of israel and because she was blind god was dealing with her envisions praise the lord amen that's the reason why we don't have visions among the people because they are not blind to this world praise the lord they are not blind to this world we see so much things that pollute our mind that is hard for the holy ghost to get your your subconscious in the place to line up with divine gift because she was blind so she was living by visions and god was not only giving her vision for herself she was having vision for everybody [Music] tell the neighbors down there go and call the neighbor gail you have to be careful i had a vision last night are we together but brandon says whatever you give to the lord he will use it and you're seeming the bible talks about simeon also being an elderly man a devote man a just and devote man a man of devotion why because he got a revelation he got a revelation this thing was so revered to him by the holy ghost that's what the scripture says by the holy ghost pentecost has not come but yet god was dealing with them by the holy ghost by his spirit amen he got a revelation not not this scared a scare factor that people i shall not die i will i will see the glory of the lord i shall not die for a bunch of fear but this man got a revelation by the holy ghost that i will see the lord's christ you know what does that mean i will see the word of god being made flesh praise the lord amen i will see the word of god be made flesh when moses said god will raise up a prophet he says i shall not die i will see that word be made flesh praise the lord that's the thing that is keeping the rapture people the thing that is keeping the rapture is for this bride to see the world being made flesh and this time it's not going to be in another person it's going to be in you some people think the rapture is the escape from their temptation you better fight that temptation and deal with that devil and put that devil on your feet the rapture can just come our lusting will be over thank you jesus are we together he was a devout man a righteous man but he got a revelation that's why brother brahm says the rapture is a revelation praise the lord god has to reveal it to you it's a revelation it's not a concept you by you just knowing about it it's a concept the songs of the prophet knew that elijah was going to be taken they knew they told elijah your master will be taken but they never had the double potion yes the bible says it was revealed to him by the holy ghost that he will not see death praise the lord until he sees the lord christ until he sees the world being made flesh what a consolation what a consolation now you can sit there and just think that it was easy for him he had this revelation but he had to fight his faith every day he had to fight things around him he had to deal with the same devil that you are dealing with yes praise the lord amen he says oh if the law would just give me the vision or the law would just reverse something to me let me tell you the more when god reveals something to you whenever god is dealing with you your life becomes difficult amen whenever god is dealing with you your life becomes difficult because all hell gets against it praise the lord and then if you're having a smooth ride you better find out who's driving praise the lord if you're having a smooth ride with all the windows down you better find out who's driving praise the lord so he had things to deal with he was an elderly man he had eggs in his body and everything but he was holding his revelation in his heart i shall not see death until i see the word be made flesh praise the lord amen so every day when he goes to church the bible says he went to the temple he was not the high priest no he was not the high priest he went to the temple every day every day he was led by the holy ghost every time he comes to church when he sit down he are not he's not looking at people dresses and people faces he's looking for the world to come through that door he's looking for the world to come through the pulpit and while he sat there and saw marion and joseph bringing a child to be dedicated he the holy ghost witness to him that's the word being made flesh he walked right there and he identified himself with the word he was not ashamed he did not care about the church order nothing he just raised the same glory be to god my eyes have seen the salvation of the lord hallelujah praise the lord what a consolation to live with that thing in your heart everyday lord i want to see your word be me flesh lord let your word be made flesh amen amen praise the lord and that's your desire and your attitude before god you will not be offended when the word is preached when the word is calling you to other and correction you will not be offended because you want the word to be made flesh in you [Music] may your world be made flesh yes yes every time he comes i know i will see it i know i will see it i will i will experience this word through my vein this body i would bring it under subjection because i need the power to call it from the dust praise the lord amen if you cannot subject it now is it when it is dust you'll be able to call it back yes are we together and the shepherds were on the field missionaries still looking for the last one that's one way that was laid to rest yesterday his memorial service praise the lord never had a complex to go anywhere he went in villages in africa at food and just associated with the people he was just loved by the people shepherds on the field and in this coming of the law we'll still have shepherds on the field looking for the last one the rapture is not our escape from our weaknesses praise the lord in the hour of the rapture is a time where we will bring those weaknesses on a subjection praise the lord that's the consolation that is in our heart that we will see the lord's christ with our eyes we will see the world be made flesh in me and in you praise the lord as a pastor that's what i look for i look for to see the word in the young people is that just to bring a beautiful message to you praise the lord is to see the word is to see how the word is transforming this assembly is to see that the things that we lift up here in this church is nothing but the pure word of god praise the lord even god himself he lift his word above his name read the book of psalms god left his word above his name because there's nothing higher than the word of god are we together so you see those those are the things uh uh uh the consolation of israel which is now our consolation the consolation of the bride the holy ghost was upon him he had a revelation it was revealed to him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ and he came to the temple in the spirit being in the spirit on the lord's day praise the lord amen and when and when he has when when he did seeing the lost christ he said lord let your seven depart in peace are calling to your word are calling to your word let yourself depart in peace because my eyes have seen your salvation praise the lord amen what it means that lord when that time comes whichever way i have to go death is just going to be a burger that i would jump on and it would rob me through the clouds [Laughter] there was no haunting feared and scared he said my eyes have seen your salvation i can walk through the valley of shadow of death i will fear no evil because death is a burgundy that a believer right to cross on the other side oh glory be to god are we happy are we together oh what a wonderful savior what a wonderful god what a wonderful master amen let me let's let's just edit something together before we get into our message i have not even started preaching here so just bear with me i'm just i'm just trying i'm trying to make contact with you amen i'm trying to make contact with you i'm not even started yet it's just an introduction let's look at jeremiah chapter 22. now look at jeremiah chapter 22. wednesday night i quoted a scripture to you i couldn't find it because i miscode i wrote something different on my note but i will get back to that jeremiah chapter 22 amen praise the lord you love the lord this morning oh yeah let's just give the lord a hand of praise he's wanted to be praised hallelujah what a modern god we sell hey man what a mighty god we said jeremiah chapter 22 let's read verse teddy let's read verse teddy praise the lord amen amen now you will see here that uh uh let me let me just get my myself together here before i uh praise the lord praise the lord now there's something in the scripture that is called the blood curse that's what we're about to read the blood curse so what's going on okay now so uh uh jeremiah chapter 20 uh 22 30 yeah thus said the lord right yeah this man chalice amen uh you you realize the other this uh i mean this was one of the songs uh uh down in the lineage of uh of the of the tribe of judah you know from uh from josiah his father was a roger's king this is uh jacqueline you know uh and and the bible says how evil he was in in the sight of the lord a very very evil uh but something is plain out here you know i'll go back to his evilness but yet god now that this is this is where i want to grab you now you have to remember that god promised david that there will be a seed because of david's sake there will always be a seed in the house of judah so from david there was supposed to be someone on the throne from the house of david onto the millennium are we together on to the millennium there was supposed to be one but now yeri said here an an evil man an evil seed has been introduced into the lineage and because of his weakness god is bringing a curse that he's now going to be chalice so what does that do it affect the covenant that god gave to david are we together but the messiah was supposed to come through the lanes of david are we together praise the lord i don't want to lose you i know your mind is flying all over the place i don't want to lose you now amen praise the lord i know jesus he's the palette of this boat but i'm i'm just there to help keep you on the boat amen so i don't want to lose you if you fall off i might be held responsible pilot responsibility responsibility is to drive you i have to keep you on the boat hey man so so pay attention now don't don't don't overeat and slumber and fall over in the water just pay attention praise the lord or you just say you know uh rejoicing over one uh uh holy ghost snack that you have got here press the link and you go falling over don't don't do that let's let's stay together thus said the lord right here this man chalice a man there shall not prosper in his days for no man of his sea shall prosper sitting upon the throne of david all ruling anymore in judah so this was a blood curse and what this curse is it did is that it cut off the messiah god has already promised oh glory be to god oh glory be to god amen he has already promised that for my seventh david's sake it was an everlasting covenant but yet he has cut off he has cut off praise the lord amen that's why we've been studying couple of weeks now about the blessing and the breath right the birthright could be taken you could lose the breath right praise the lord amen here god comes because of the weakness god cursed this man in his seat and said no more received from this wicked lineage sit on the throne praise the lord now so god has cut himself he have got himself in the ticket he has to bring himself out yes praise the lord he has now to bring himself out because this is the one that promised the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent and that's the one i promised david an everlasting throne that the son of david will rule over the nations this one that promised abraham to be the father of nations and all of these promises was pointing to the coming of the messiah for yet he has cut it so he has cut himself in the ticket he has to bring himself out god has to now bring himself out hallelujah [Laughter] oh automatic god we said praise the lord hallelujah now you will understand why the promise of the virgin birth was important now you will understand it will make more sense to you when god told ahash i will give you a sign a virgin shall conceive so now god is now going through the lineage of the male he has now to take another approach and bring a virgin oh thank you jesus oh he's a waymaker praise the lord he is a way maker [Music] because when god speaks he swear by himself he is a waymaker praise the lord amen it will make more sense to you when you read the book of luke when luke gave his genealogy he didn't go like matthew when no luke went from merit because of this curse because there is no way the messiah would have come through the lineage of david when god has cursed this royal sea line praise the lord let's look in the book of luke praise the lord glory be to god thank you jesus praise the lord thank you [Music] luke chapter 3 luke chapter 3 verse 23 the bible says and jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age being as was supposed the son of joseph how did he became the son of joseph supposedly because of mary praise the lord so you see that's how joseph with his connection to mary the messiah is now using joseph linage oh my goodness praise the lord and then over in verse 31 that's when it now connects back to david now it's bridged back to david and going back to abraham and going back to adam and adam back to god praise the lord now you will see why the virgin birth was so important while the virgin bird was so important because it was a breach the virgin birth was so important because it ties everything back to genesis the virgin birth brings the value of the three sacrifices that god gave to a woman the virgin birth brings value to that that's the reason why young women don't mess yourself up don't allow facebook and the evil of this age to destroy those sacrifices that god gave to you the virgin birth was not to put a statue in catholic church the virgin birth was not because of a woman that the roman catholic want to live up over the world the virgin birth was important to bring value to the three sacrificial that god gave to a woman her virgin saint her womanhood and her motherhood are you hearing me this morning i don't know if you swallow your amen but i hope you hear me i mean i could take you down that robber i'm not talking about the curse this morning i just i just want to i just wanted to to use this for us to see the importance of the virgin birth why god in that evil city and that evil time that they were living in without a prophet the sadducees and the pharisees they they have raising on the scene and all they are doing is just reasoning they are just reasoning with the holiness of god trying to make their movement popular but the effect of god has gone from the people no effect of the word church has just become form formality praise the lord and the angel gabriel visited this man john he never allowed his age to reduce his service the bible says he was a just man he was a devote man he went to the temple and and he burned incense and what burning incense represent to the church of this last day he was a prayer warrior he gets to the to the building before the people comes he said lord bless the worshippers as they are coming father bless the musician lord bless the preacher he just blew incense in a place and everybody knew john for that that he was a prayer warrior praise the lord amen do you see that just like we selling malachi on on on on wednesday night a man dedicating his life to that cost but yet he has gone chalice those are the kind of things that will make laodicea's christians their past will be their heroes oh i used to pray uh you know i used to be a prayer warrior you get a bunch of people that have their past as their hero they don't have no present-day hero because they are failure and backsplatters they are only dwelling on the path those days those days those days are dead lord be to god how can you put that into context that's the reason why the people in malacca the struggle with his message about the love of god how can you call this the love of god we are just coming out as cartes the god of heaven how can you call this are we together but you see when a man has hate himself in god when he has hated himself in god not because he's scared he had himself in god because he loved god praise the lord god when he have hate himself in god yes nothing of this word praise the lord yes whether he have a vehicle or you have it does not bother him he's hate in god by love lord jesus praise the lord amen so you can just see in that coming of the lord look at the people that god was dealing with every one of them have problems every one of them zechariah elizabeth chalice they have gossip about her until they don't even know what to say every child in the time knew about elizabeth not having a child but it did not change their service to god [Music] hannah was a blind woman she could have just call it cut it off i'm blind i can't see i don't need to read bible but it did not change let's marry that a young young virgin girl planning for her future living right kept herself living right doing everything that is right but she will soon become the scandal of the town because god has found favor with her brother branham said when god found favor with you he will allow the whole church to talk about you [Applause] you that love praises from people what a consolation what a consolation you realize that their consolation was not in ethnic things consolation was not in being popular or in the in the most popular movement i mean the message i mean the message if that is your cancellation you're deceiving yourself because you know in your heart if you're not living right that's right their consolation was in the way that god was dealing with them desperate of their situation that's part of their trial that's part of their difficulties every time they hear the word of god god speaks to them oh thank you jesus thank you jesus lord you still love me thank you jesus the thing that order would despise will be the little thing that will make them to weep so god thank you thank you for your love what a consolation to live in this hour where prosperity and willingness is all on the people's mind competition no time for god not only no time for church but no time for god praise the lord at that word a person who lived their life for themself lived a selfish life praise the lord a person will live their life for themselves live a selfish life we must live for others the scripture says there you want another burden so fulfill the lord of christ and we got to have feelings for one another and therefore when you do all you know how to do then when you do later at night well you have the consolation knowing that you have done your best knowing that you have done your best you don't allow yourself to be judged by what people think about you i don't care what you think about me you don't know my life a person who lived their life for themselves live a selfish life you can never find consolation in that you're not finding consolation in the life that you're living you're finding cancellation in the things you have i have this i have that i have this but inside there is no consolation because you stay one more amen this age is an age a spiritual age of hollows can never be satisfied people find counsel in things that they have they can number them i have this one they have that one i have that one inside they are empty when you have consolation in here the least you have satisfy you one one one one one one can never be satisfied hallelujah because you have so much you can't even pack your back and toe it your own belonging is weighing you down who pack it for you we'll put rack inside are we together i know uh the young people have a meeting today so i won't ruin it for you brother dan i'll do my best natto praise the lord do my best now though are we together the maniaca gathered i rather have favor with god and be called a holy brother a fanatic or whatever you want to call me i'd rather have favor with god to know that he's standing here this afternoon praise the lord amen and uh [Music] brother jordan can you put up that uh uh histone picture the pillow of fire when brother bran said this he was actually he was actually referring to death so i would love to do the same he was actually referring to that to that picture he says i would rather have favor with god and be called a holy ruler or a fanatic or whatever you want to call me and have favor with god to know that he's standing here this afternoon then all the wealth yes lord minneapolis god forgive me all the glory that the word has got i would rather be standing right here now holding this picture and telling you what that is and know that he's standing right here within five feet from where i'm standing right now i did rather have this feeling and consolation that i have right now than to be a king over the earth for a million years praise the lord amen i mean what what people don't understand ace dead you know people i mean what people don't understand that you know uh uh brother was was uh you know talking to meaning and sharing some concern i told you i said what people don't understand is that this picture is not about brother brennan this picture is more authentic than this picture this is just a painting this picture is god and layering signs [Music] god allowing signs since you will believe signs more than god god allow your signs to be able to pick up the pillow of fire [Applause] we make it about brother brandon that's why people are afraid of it it's not about brother branham brother branham said i was just dead it just happened that i was there it's more about the pillow of fire the same pillar of fire that met paul on the road of damascus the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel that pillar of fire has dedicated itself in our day [Applause] god bringing a consolation to his church when he said i will never leave you and never forsake you wherever god's people are this light is always there praise the lord it's not when you put it there that it's there it's not when you put it there that is there god has already put it in god has already dedicated this message of the hour god has dedicated his prophet nothing you can do about it you can have your opinion [Music] what a day what an age that we are living in praise the lord amen the seed of god eternal life comes from the greek war zoe so it is that life soul is a life of god and if the life of god living in you it will produce a godly life just as setting as i'm standing here on this platform and the man that got it can no more perish then god can perish because god is in that man i don't know when we say greta is he that is in me than in the word sometimes it's just a concept praise the lord if you are saying that because you want to break you are standing on the wrong foot oh praise the lord glory be to god the man that got it can a normal perish because god is in that man he that hearing my word and believe on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation praise the lord he that i eat my flesh and drink my blood i will rise him up in the last day that's his word what a consolation yes to the believer yes it is what a consolation amen what a consolation to the believer by the way we have in communion on the first sunday in october what a consolation to know that when we come around the communion table is not a ritual it's not a ritual it's an ordinance it's an ordinance we have consolation that we are doing what jesus told us to do that's our consolation he that eat my flesh and drink my blood praise the lord amen but you see what what has gone wrong with the church is that they have placed that ordinance above the word of god no that ordinary is in honor of the word of god is in honor of the word of god it's not about the word of god it's not more holy than this word is holy we find a consolation because we have been identified with that body by death burial and resurrection by the way of baptism so we find a consolation we find a consolation how can a believer that is identified with his body don't find consolation in the communion how what are you afraid of what are you scared of they wish me they buried you alive you was not dead they bury you alive but if you were dead you will find consolation be to god are we together the consolation of israel god dealing with those people see see that take care of that that joseph found himself after he have he have trusted the lord he raised his children now he thought he had found a wife he knew this girl he he observed her he knows that she loved the lord and now she's coming with this message i've seen an angel joseph is scared to death he don't want to blaspheme but yet he had never heard any young person saying they have seen an angel not even the priests in the temple talking about angel they don't preach about angels because the sadducees did not believe in angels the pharisees believe in angels but they believe that angels only for heaven so joseph is scared to death he's afraid what am i going to do i love her so dearly she has never been me to me i cannot publicly disgrace her oh god help me oh god help me the bible said he was a just man now even in the time that he was quoting her because he was a responsible man he would not even try to fletch with her he will not get in no unclean thing with her because he wanted to respect her he's there oh god help me oh god help me lord help me what would i do can't even get a good sleep it's just trouble what will i do lord what will i do father help me i don't want to be wrong i don't want to be wrong lord please i don't want to be wrong and that very night the same injury that spoke to mary stood by her bedside and said joseph they see me injured the same angel praise the lord we just had a revival here brother flame ministering on ministry of angels we had angels all over this place you know the first time i saw people running from their seat to the altar i think the angels were pushing you angels were really on work that morning get up let's go you have to deal with this thing let's go go out i sat there i just cried i said oh god oh god oh god give us a heart to yield to your word take every proud spirit lord but the same angel stood by his bed the same angel because he was in the you are right oh how that just brought a little strength to mary's shoulder she said now i think i can go and tell my cousin elizabeth praise the lord now i think because nobody will believe me [Applause] oh thank you jesus [Applause] hallelujah glory be to god amen [Music] and as soon as the lesbian saw her little john had his own experience glory to god that little baby kicking in the womb [Laughter] what a god with yourself little john happiness own a revival blessed by god oh praise the lord is the atmosphere of his presence that's the benefit for the children in the atmosphere [Music] john did not understand about uh the injured or all of that it was just the atmosphere that was created praise the lord and in the rapture in time that atmosphere will be the benefit of our children their atmosphere will affect them praise the lord glory be to god elizabeth what what what a vision what a salutation my goodness they were all dealing with things they were all dealing with things but yet god was visiting them in the coming of the lord and giving him consolation that i know what you're going through hannah i knew that you dedicated your life for me and yet you go blind but i will give you visions in this hour of the coming of the lord when we are just going from one deaf news to another deaf news but god is still giving his people consolation we are still finding comfort and counsel in his word we can still raise our hands we can still clap our hands we can stay sink even if they want to have us to have the marks on we will have it on we will still think because we find consolation in his presence praise the lord a lot of people are working their mind out praying god they don't this is not strange to god he knows about this god gave his people consolation even in the lion then in the fires of phonics when his children were in captivity he still gave them consolation why should it be different for you why should your god only be the god that just do good things yes when others suffer spill their blood for this gospel god is going to comfort you in your hour of need no matter what you're dealing with he knows that better than you know it [Music] no matter whatever you dealing with praise the lord it's just that you have put something on your mind and you are demanding god to do it that's the disrespect of this age this is the age of defiant people put things on their mind and demand god to do it when the things that he's doing around them they never laid for their hands and said thank you jesus you've been so good to me thank you lord yes they don't see it why because they have put things on their mind and they are sticking god to the gun you either do it or you are not god what does he do or not he still remain my lord he stay still remaining my god amen oh what a god we serve oh what a god we serve what almighty god we serve praise the lord we might have a strong consolation making zeddy the great prince we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us what a marvelous promise two immutable things god cannot lie and be god if god has made a promise in his bible we believe the bible to be the infallible word of god and if god has made a promise in this bible we have this consolation to know that it is impossible for him to lie yes we have this consolation to know that a god that ourselves he do not change he do not lie amen praise the lord oh my therefore when we see the promise when we see he promised it in the bible we believe it with our soul body and spirit it's impossible for him to lie if there is if there is any thought it is in us like i said a couple of weeks ago we must learn to honor for our failures we must learn to honor for our failure we must blame ourselves because god remained the same the almighty god is still dealing with people in visions he's still dealing with people in dreams he's still healing the sick he's still raising the dead he's still changing lives [Applause] we must learn to blame ourselves the problem is with us we have become too lazy to take god at his word we'll rather take what somebody said on facebook or on google then to take god [Music] if there is any fault it's in us not in god for god is obligated to his word and he has sown by himself amen praise the lord oh my god when we get to seeing it in that light things begin to shift up and keep up different than what we used to be healing of the body becomes affection it doesn't becomes a fiction it becomes a reality the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't become emotional workup it becomes a reality of the dwelling presence the reality of the dwelling presence the reality of the dwelling presence that reality is in you does that mean that you will not say a lie no you will tell a lie but that reality will say you just lie will make it right that's what the holy ghost will do sorry i said the wrong thing and we're wrong i said lord i made a mistake praise the lord that is the reality of the dwelling presence of the holy ghost [Music] it becomes a reality of the dwelling presence of the lord jesus christ to change the life if god promised that he saw no matter how much rise up to try to counterfeit or impersonate how many things rise up to contract date they can rise up and post whatever they want to post on facebook about this message we have the reality right here it has changed my life it has changed my life it's given me consolation you got to know the man you didn't get to know his message because his message was to turn our house back to the house of the father you heard about the man but you never heard his message hallelujah thank you jesus hallelujah thank you lord how many things rise up and try to contradict or take it down i will go on and on and on oh god give me grace please lord give me grace let me go on and on and on for god has sown by himself that he will keep it right now whatever he preached whatever he promised he would keep it yes but brandon says if i fail to preach it and laid it down he said god will raise somebody up amen god will raise somebody up if you fail to live for god god will raise somebody up he's able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham you can go with your pump up prayer life go and do whatever you choose to do god will raise up of these stones if you fail to believe it there will be somebody step into your place [Music] to believe it instead of you this this particular statement became so real to me many years ago when i started as a young preacher that was back in 1994 we had a house that we were in it was it was a melody guest house that was back back in liberia there uh uh and now we we were brothers but we have one room that we have as a prayer room we just kept that room as a prayer room if you want to pray just go in and uh so how i'll observe this over and over and over you know how right in the middle of the night you just feel that the lord woke you up to pray you just feel that amen and as soon as i slumber and start turning around the next thing i would hear somebody praying i would say oh god you wanted to talk to somebody and i didn't wake up to talk so you woke him up if you fail to believe god will raise up somebody to step in your place and believe i witnessed that over and over and over even till now i see it sometimes i have a burden on my heart something overseas or something i want to do and i prayed about it and prayed about god you know and when it's need to be done god will raise of somebody if you fail to believe it there will be somebody step into your place to believe it instead of you for god have sown he will do it oh what a consolation that gave us and the beautiful part about it my christian friends is to think that now we have the evidence we have a we have a year in blessing we have it in power we have it a miracle we have it in signs and wonders praise the lord we have the evidence amen we have the evidence brother branham says we have it a miracle we have it in science he said we have it even in picture what i just show you some evidence of his presence a pillar of fire we have it in every way that god has promised it more than he promised to give it to us musicians you can come i will stop here the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet might keep going on praise the lord looks like you people can't get filled amen praise the lord he drained the preacher of all his notes all his strength praise the lord oh my what a god what a god what a king what a god what a king what a god what a king i bless your name i bless your name let's just raise our hand let's just praise him praise the lord i bless your me i'll bless your name [Music] i gave you [Music] on earth
