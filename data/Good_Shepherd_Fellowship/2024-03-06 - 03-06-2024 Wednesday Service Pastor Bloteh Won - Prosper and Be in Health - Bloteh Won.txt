good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and uh we want to start the last part of our beginning series we want to uh we want to get on the last part that would be from second John actually the last part we will be studing T John but uh uh the reading would come out of 2 John praise the Lord amen second John and again uh uh on behalf of the the the ministers the officers we want to say thank you once again for every one of you that make uh the the worship night successful and uh and just like I said praying uh uh I think it was a confirmation to what we've been speaking on God gave us a beginning uh that was the first time we did that in this assembly and and we want to thank the Lord and we pray that will not be the last time praise the Lord and I was thinking about that I mean if we can have a singing night we can also have a Praying night amen we can have a Praying night we can have have a testimony night and uh and it's it's just all part of our fellowship with the King praise the Lord so we will trust to see uh you know uh how the Lord will be able to help us I would not want to keep you standing too long we will read the scripture and then I will continue with my statement let's read uh 2 John chapter 6 that's where I'm taking the seventh the seventh beginning the seventh uh beginning of of of our series seven that will be the last even though this would not be the last night I will talk about it but uh that's that's the last uh uh of the of the Sev that we've been speaking on on Sunday we might go over that again but uh let's let's just read verse six uh and this is love that we walk after his commandment this is the Commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning yes should walk in it praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat while you turn to T John I will study tonight or uh exitation tonight coming from T John and if you if you observe this entire beginning series give us the privilege to be able to go through the ENT entire first second in t John I don't know if you took a time to really read through it but uh there are some things uh over in t John uh some characters will will be looking at uh uh while we go into this but just like I was saying and uh uh uh I didn't not have no no idea how the the worship night was going to turn out but I mean I was I was very proud and I was very blessed that uh uh that we had there praise the Lord and uh and to see that uh we could work around our basic schedule and and come in and and support what was going on that was that was very beautiful that was that was such a blessing that was such a blessing uh many that uh prayed about it and and supported you see uh uh every every great group of people I was thinking about this familiar familiar quote that we we quote all the time and uh uh we quot it brother brandham says uh if the bride know who she is she will be an invincible Army praise the Lord for many years back uh I took the word as invisible for many years back and and uh uh and I think uh I might not be the only one that was guilty of that because I've heard brother brothers saying that the day that I uh it caught my mind to be able to look at that word carefully I went to see what the definition was uh uh and and that that word that brother brandham used Invincible it means uh um an army that is uh incapable of to overcome to subal and uh that cannot be defeated praise the Lord amen and an army that cannot be defeated an army that can overcome an army that is able to subdue so uh uh so we know that that that is a promise and that only comes when uh when we when we know know who we are in the sense of what has been given to us why are we here for why are we here you know uh in in one Sense on the earth in another sense why are we here you know as a body as a people uh uh in this assembly what are we doing here when that Revelation when that knowledge start becoming real to us then uh you know we become an overcoming group PR praise the Lord and for many years we have said that you know God has placed us in a very unique position uh uh you know with uh blessing us with uh uh you know our our cultural group people from different backgrounds and also you know uh uh the the diversities that we bring we he placed Us in such a position that uh whatever we set our our mind to to do we can do it praise the Lord amen whatever we set our mind to and we prayed about it if it's ACC calling to the word of God we can do it I believe that praise the Lord uh many years ago when we put our heart to holding special meetings we were able to carry carry up I think for four five five different year we sustain the de bringing brothers from around the country and uh and it was it was a unique thing and and I believe that there are a lot of things that is in store for us praise the Lord as a church and as a people and we just we just pray that God uh in his uh in his Sovereign Grace will be able to help us praise the Lord he will be able to help us and and bring to pass uh uh the things that uh he will want want to achieve in our midst praise the Lord but uh once again we want to be very very grateful to all of you musicians and uh technicians that were able to make the time to uh uh and in the entire body that make uh that weekend special praise the Lord amen we know that it was not uh uh a coner of selling tickets and raising money that was not the purpose the purpose was just to create an atmosphere amen it was it was just the purpose of worshiping our King praise the Lord and uh it was it was such it was so beautiful it was so beautiful it was not boring never took too much of a Time praise the Lord you know this is one of those things just like a preacher you know when the when the when the atmosphere is rip the preacher run out of not you you stay on expectation and there is nothing more for him to say and I think we were on expectation to keep singing and the brother just thought that it was okay praise the Lord that was beautiful that was beautiful tell John chapter 1 that's where we want to we want to come in on tonight we want to start from there and then on Sunday we'll continue if the Lord want us to to uh but as we read uh uh uh 2 John in verse uh 6 this is the love that we walk that we walk in his commandment I want to I want to talk on something uh uh trying to find a title how to title this this uh uh seven beginning but you will see when we get to when we when we read uh um Ted John there is only one chapter you'll get a picture of uh uh the way I will try to bring a title to this the unto the well beloved G whom I love in the truth belov I wish above all things that thou May prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper amen for I Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is inde thee even as thou walth in the truth now if you go back back to that verse six that we that we read you will see uh that's that's how uh John uh uh uh that's what he stated there the love from the beginning and that love was walking in the truth now so uh uh tonight I want to look at something here as we look at the beginning as we look back uh you know to the beginning and we'll be talking from the beginning that's what we've been dealing with since this year what we want to look at here is the that uh God's children from the beginning they walk in health amen John says here I wish above all things that thou May prosper in health even as thy Soul prospereth praise the Lord so if we look back to the beginning we realize that when God made his first son and his first daughter they were the he being that have ever been on Earth praise the Lord they came right from the hands of God with no illness no illness in their body no illness in their soul no illness in their Spirit praise the Lord now you have to remember that we taking this whole series now from The Book of Revelation John seeing the continuation of the of the church or the continuation of the work of Jesus Christ he's seeing the people coming through the the the revelation of Jesus seeing that we are returning back to Eden and he's seeing the bride you know and and his the the marriage of the Lamb he had the privilege to see the the the the four square City he had the privilege to see everything from now on to what eternity would be and no doubt he can come back to the church and and says uh I wish above all things that thou May prosper in health even as that Soul Prosper praise the Lord so as we talk as we talk on this subject you'll realize there the we will go in the area of talking truth Prosperity because God Prosper his people praise the Lord amen and man May uh H form of PR erity and and a man trying to put on a form that he's prospering he's just he's just impersonating praise the Lord God is the one that fish the Heaven and the Earth and when he make it there was there was nothing like him praise the Lord there was nothing like him since the sun being up it had never rain out of current praise the Lord are we together he's the god that that that brings true Prosperity we'll look into that tonight we just want to take few thoughts and condition our mind as we as we look at the subject tonight so we see that God's children in the beginning you think about that Adam in the beginning he was the the the most prosperous man on the earth that even he could he could come up with a name for an animal and it was just exactly what it's supposed to be praise the Lord amen they were walking in good health and is God's desire that above everything that that we must be in good health because I'm telling you if you are healthy and you are broke without a dime you can be more happier than the man that have all the money stuck in the bank but he don't have health to get to the bank and make use of it praise the Lord nothing important than good health so take care of yourself give yourself good sleep praise the Lord give yourself good sleep what think about it the Bible says God do not sleep he do not Slumber but yet he GTH sleep to his beloved there's a reason why praise the Lord amen there's a reason why sleep is one of the best ingredient to good health praise the Lord amen sleep is one of the best ingredient to Good Health our our age uh this age is detera because science have given us all sorts of media that Rob us of sleep find people the uh especially the young people spend half of the night on the phone looking at what they are not looking at they are not supposed to be looking at and they get up in the morning so tired as if to say they were carrying tons of break on their head it's all because you didn't sleep one of the best ingredients for good health is sleep praise the Lord are we together so we want to look at this that uh uh what they were walking in through truth and and uh and and because they were walking in truth in the beginning they were walking in good health they were walking in good health I would take few calls tonight and uh uh I was I was listening to a message that that that U it got me into uh uh into a tunnel into a valley and I was thinking about okay uh let me not run ahead of myself I have enough time to be able to develop this but uh if you if you think about it you will you will realize that uh in the book of Corinthian and also in the book of Peter the Bible speaks about also in the Book of Romans the Bible says uh uh let let's just read few of those verses and uh let's read few of those verses I don't I didn't have them over in mind in my note but uh praise the Lord but there were just few of those uh uh things you think about and as you are looking at the subject Romans chapter 88 verse 32 Romans chapter 8:32 we'll just take one of those verses there let's read from verse 31 what shall we say it what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spare not his own son but deliver him up for us all how shall he net with him also freely give us all things praise the Lord amen amen all things if he could give us if he could spend that his son which of course we know that it was God taking on sisting element body stepping down to come and identify himself with us if God could go to that length of giving his life what will he hold back from Us Praise the Lord I'll tell you that Adam never had to work work a day to become the heers of the heavens and the Earth to be uh H uh uh uh the governor in in uh uh Eden he never had a work a day it was freely given to him and God told him have dominion praise the Lord he owned everything he was an amateur God on Earth everything was subject to him he never had to work a day if God would give us his life then what will he hold back what is good for you or what are you Desiring that he will hold back are we together praise the Lord if you if you if you think about it before Adam came he never had to work to start Gathering things everything was there that's why man was made on the sixth day he was the last one God had prepared everything everything that you need for this life Journey was already here before you got here praise the Lord you think that you are working hard you think that's why you think in your mind but God has already supplied praise the Lord you you are just breaking into what God has already freely given he that spare not his own son but deliver him up for us or how shall he net with him also freely give us all things praise the Lord the fall put us in a position of work the fall put us in a position where we are at this place we want to do something we want to achieve something but God never me it that way praise the Lord brother Bram says preparation he says just like every parent would do before a child is born they go uh you know they never wait and say uh uh you know buddy you are born you I mean you got to do some few work here before we get Dappers for you we need to get your bathtub but you just stop crying you I mean you got to startop behave yourself before we give you a bathtub no parent does that praise the Lord no parent does that before the child even come forth all the preparation Jesus said I go and prepare a place for you that's the way it was from the beginning that is God's that that is God's approach before we get here he makes all the preparation praise the Lord how shall he that with Christ freely give us all things are we together yeah sometimes we think that uh let's look at another one again look at this one uh let's look at uh 1 Corinthians chapter 6 this one this these other two verses actually that's what I was I was thinking about uh uh yesterday I was thinking about it yesterday listening to a message I was driving up yesterday evening to visit a brother and his wife I was playing the message but I I was thinking about this while I was uh listen to this now now uh 1 Corinthians chapter 6:2 do you not know that the Saints shall judge the word and if the word shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matter amen if we're going to judge the word is it I mean can we just sit down and talk things between ourself should we be spraying it trying to get you know thousand people opinion should we be blackmailing one another know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life do you see the the disadvantage place that our sin birth put us in it put us in a in a very disadvantaged place because as we as we go along and we look in the subject you will realize there we never needed to work a day in our life praise the Lord amen there was no F in the in the wilderness when Moses LED those people for 40 years there was no shopping center that was after the fall that was not in the Garden of Eden that was after the fall God St proof praise the Lord that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God that just being h h h h dedicated to the word of God God God God heard them even though they were auring they were they were grumbling they were complaining against Moses but that pillow of fire that was hanging over them by night that was the presence of God that was the lust and and and that was the word the world was there because the word was there he healed their sicknesses praise the Lord there were children that were born in the wilderness and you know where children is there is always cuts and and and and breaking forth and all of that because children will always be children praise the Lord but yet God sustained them this mindset that God created the word and sent us down here to suffering is is the sin is the sin is the sin nature that tells you that praise the lord it's the same nature that tells you that that's the reason why h a man we we we feel like we we need to do something to to bring up bring ourself to to a better status Cod are we together now let's take this one and we start we start preaching here before our time is gone second Peter chapter 1 now this this will be the last part of what we will be dealing with on this subject because it will bring us a little bit into the statue of the perment to understand why brother brandham called that a living Monument because that's what Adam was praise the lord we will understand why Peter said if those things be in you you will not be Barren amen praise the Lord but this is this is what I I want for us to be able to see here let's read from verse two Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord I calling as his divine power have given unto us all things all things all things all things all things a Believer can have all things a Believer can have everything thing praise the Lord what we need is the character yes it's not wrong for you to have an airplane but do you have the character that's right that goes with an airplane owner yes do you have the character it's not wrong to have a lemong guinea but do you have the character when you step out of that car will you still be the Son of God that you supposed to be all with thousand of things being running through your head everybody looking at me now I think they are looking at me you already locked the car before you get down but you keep locking it will you will you get the character having all things anything you want is not sinful is because you don't have the character to sustain those things that's what make it Troublesome according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain onto life all things that pertain onto life whatever you want to have to make life easier for you here on Earth you have a right to have it it's not sin to have it but do you have the character that's what those virtues are for we'll come to that like I said that's the last part of it that's the last part of the last series praise the Lord Above All Things John said above all things I desire that you you will be healthy you prosper in health even as your soul Prosper are we together praise the Lord now so we we we we we just trying to grab ourself in the picture here to be able to realize that in the beginning as we go back to the beginning God's children they work in prosperity praise the Lord they were prospering in their eyesight that they were naked and they never knew they were naked you will never have that eyesight that Holy veil has been raped you will never have that perfect upsite praise the Lord that's how much healthy they were that's how healthy they were that they were naked and they never knew they were naked which mean their minds were not corrupt their minds were not polluted it praise the Lord that man has fallen Fallen to such a low state that all he need to see is just an apparel hanging on the line and then his mind is is corrupted they were walking in perfect health praise the Lord God Amen with no sense of fear that's that's that's one of the thing that is also destroying our our health fear praise the Lord because there is nothing there is just only you but because of fear your heart is even beaten thinking that praise the Lord but there was no fear and that's where we are going back to that's where the word is restoring us back to are we together now let's let's take this other approach tonight it's a Wednesday night when you let's go to the Book of exodor Exodus chapter 3 Exodus chapter CH 3 was really in a place uh thinking about how how to be able to to bring this tonight not to not to Bard you or not to spill out all of my my thoughts but uh you've been you've been very gracious to me tonight let's read verse 7 and the Lord said I will sure I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt speaking to Moses and I have heard their Cry by the reason of their Tax Masters for I know their sorrow and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of I mean out of that land onto a good land and a large a good en large land onto a land flooring with milk and honey now God was speaking to Moses that was Moses in the presence of the burning bu God was speaking to Moses and now giving him this commission I've come down to bring my people out of the land of Egypt and I'm going to take them to a better land I'm going to take them to a land that is floing with milk and honey you will see it all through uh uh uh uh EX the Leviticus every time God speaks about the promised land he will say the land is floting with milk and honey but when they got to the promised land there was nothing there was there was no physical place where the land was floating it looks like honey just coming from the rock all milk just pouring out no no it was it it was it was a it was a kind of a destructive way that God was describing that I'm bringing you to a better place I'm bringing you to a land of Health amen just like John is saying here that you will prosper in your health even as your soul has prospered God is saying I'm I'm going to bring you I'm bringing you out of this land where where you are you you you you you have been weped by Tax Masters I mean you are you I mean you you are let me say it in our term you are under the clock amen you've been whipped by the clock I'm bringing you to a land of rest amen I'm bringing you to a land of rest a land that is flooring with milk and honey that's the way he describ it praise the Lord but actually when you look over in in Joshua chapter 1 when the people got across the land The Manor even stopped falling they got to go in the field and look for the dry corn but it was their land praise the Lord it was a land that belongs to them are we together they were now going to enjoy the promise that God gave their father Abraham if they were not going to compromise with the inhabitants of the land and start looking for people to bring tributes if they were going to push the people out of the land drive them out of the land just like God told them to do it was a place if God could sustain them in the wilderness God could also provide everything that he needed praise the Lord amen look at the Battle of Jericho they never even had how to live for a sword to fight the Lord fought their about to throw the walls of Jericho down it was their land praise the Lord amen now compare it to this compare it to this you see where I'm going tonight compare it to this the Bible says there in Acts chapter 2 The Promise is unto you and to your children into as many as the Lord Our God shall called what is the promise what's the promise praise the Lord amen what's the promise anybody the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is that promise but where is the land of the Holy Ghost where is the lande where are you supposed to enjoy the Holy Ghost it's not in heaven you're supposed to enjoy the Holy Ghost in This body that's right the Holy Ghost is the promise this body is the Lamb that's the reason why the Holy Ghost is not a sensation where we just shake and shake and shake and you know and and and and and and and you know and blaspheme as we are speaking in tongues no the Holy Ghost is aive that come and possess this body and make you to enjoy God in your sickness you enjoy God when you are broke you enjoy God it's a land that is floing with milk and honey but yet they have battles in the land they have to fight war in the land praise the lord it's the same way our land is floing with milk and honey when you have the Holy Ghost but we have battles praise the Lord you see that is the reason why God promising you good health because if you don't have good health you will not enjoy the Holy Ghost praise the Lord you will not enjoy the Holy Ghost it would take it will take it would take more it would take a deeper experience with God praise the Lord amen are we together are you with me tonight amen let's just Rie of this uh part of decision there in 1955 the Bible says are who above all things you prosper in health is yours God promised it and the promise to you is just as good as as it was to isra that is the comparison that was making praise the Lord your promise their promise was a physical land your promise is a spiritual land the Holy Ghost dwelling in your physical body amen he said I've given it to you I've given you that land I'll send my angels this Pillar of Fire before you to guide you to the place Divine Healing is yours God promised it to you he send the Holy Ghost has gathered you to this place praise the Lord let's take it amen it's ours are we together healing what what cancer is he says may every sickness get scared when when when these handkerchiefs are laid on them may they move back and let the believer pass over to this Promised Land the promise of good health as thou has said in your word word I wish above all things that you you prosper in health praise the Lord are we together blind bimos let me take this this one I'm looking for you we are taught in the scripture that one day God's children was on the march to the promised land that God had promised them it was it was a good land a healthy land floring with milk and honey okay this is where I saw him I saw brother Bram trying to tith uh uh what John said to the promised land you you look you look through the series of that you'll see how he's tiing perfect health good health to the promised land amen go to way Jesus God made you okay that's that's exactly this is the one I was looking for okay go God made you to be healthy the devil got in Genesis 3 but God made you to be healthy praise the Lord amen you never seen a person crying and says why why am I not sick you'll never see a person praise the Lord even the man that is doing the worst thing in his life he want to be healthy praise the Lord some people are not eating right but they want to be healthy why because we were made to be healthy God never make Adam and Eve sick they never came out sick the devil got him are we together God made you to be healthy the devil got in don't you think don't you think he will have to obey him the same as the way don't you think he will have to obey him the same as the way he made your body he made you a human being he made your eyes and give you health I hold above all things that you prosper in health praise the Lord we're coming to the part of where your soul is prospering but tonight what I want I want to to bring us to is the other uh even many times it's it's a sad thing but many times we fall ill before we realize that it's been a while since we felt sick praise the Lord we thank the Lord for the good day we thank the Lord and and uh uh but how much are we conscious that he's keeping us in good health praise the Lord beside the sneezing and the running nose the the the the headache because you did not give yourself enough sleep that's why you have some headache sometime praise the Lord it can never be compared to h h h some of the illness that that that other people are are struggling with in their body some of the things that that that people deal with is is because of age praise the Lord the ELD ones Among Us but even in the midst of all of that the Lord in his Mercy has been keeping you healthy praise the Lord you might complain that maybe you I mean you you you have not got the the the job of your dream or where you supposed to be in your Finance you are not dead yet praise the Lord but we slightly think when was the last time that we slept a week in the hospital praise the Lord and that's and that is the thing that make us sometimes we don't appreciate that the same angel that walked with isra in the wilderness is in our camp the one that was keeping them where is in our camp you we don't realize that maybe you think it's your eating habit praise the Lord some people are struggling with illness in their body that they that they inherited genetically they don't smoke they don't drink but I mean through through their bloodrain they they have inherited illness praise the Lord one last we thank the Lord for the good health say Lord thank you for good health praise the lord we don't think about it that way but when you work around the hospital and you work you know you get you go there or whatever you you you become very grateful you become very grateful and it puts you to the place where you walk every I mean you you walk all over the place and you you are just praying oh God be merciful help that person oh God bless that person we don't think about it God designed Us in such a way such a beautiful way try and close you now I think I've I've uh been able to create a good setting to to ride on this subject for the why created in such a beautiful way you get yourself ready for bed you get in bed but the moment that you cross from awake to sleep you will never tell that meaning that second that you slip from Consciousness to sleep if you say you know you were not sleeping praise the Lord that moment that second that you slip out of sleep back to Consciousness it's only one person that turn on the switch is all my Mighty God praise the Lord if your alarm could wake you up we better get enough alarm in a grave are we together brother Bram said this in the greatest battle ever fought we read this in and just uh uh prepared ourself to pray tonight and all we want to do is to just thank the Lord for good health thank the lord for keeping us healthy praise the Lord amen am might be dealing with stomach ache I might be dealing with one thing or another but I'm healthy praise the Lord amen God word said above all things I want you to prosper in health he said that's right how can you be a real Soldier out there if you are not healthy how will you be able to fight the devil praise the Lord amen most time when we are when we when we are sick and out all we do oh God have mercy on me you are not saying Satan I rebuke you in Jesus name I cast you out oh God have mercy on me oh Lord have mercy on me praise the Lord how can you be a real Soldier out there if you are not in good health but you see that's that is that is where the uh uh you know the the the the the the the car carasic movement uh you know they are making their money and all of that because all of those people that run down run to those places for healing amen they never appreciate good health they never realize that good health is given to them to for them to be able to fight and take their ground spend time in the presence of God pray for their children pray for their loved ones amen exercise themself in the things of God and in the things of righteousness they wait until they don't have the strength anymore then they're looking for the man that will be able to lay hands on their head so they can fall on the ground and health will come back to their body they go from one Divine healer to another Divine healer the Bible says let everything that have birth praise the Lord amen let everything that have birth when we wake up in the morning and our hands can move we must raise it up and say thank you Jesus if when our feet can move say Lord I bless your name you said how can you be a real Soldier how can you be a real Soldier out there see I want you to prosper in health there it is is that right those Chanel if you if you just get them open up now he's talking about the channel which is the the the the the five senses of the body and the five senses of the spirit also we will deal with that when we get when we get to the to the ending part and when we were talking about how our soul because uh John is saying here just just like your soul is prospering and our soul can only prosper in the word amen Solomon says your word have brought healing to my bones your word has brought healing to the marrow of my bones when they were walking in the beginning they were walking in perfect health praise the Lord amen our perfect health that we have is the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen why because this body is not redeemed this body will go through crisis but a man or a woman that is filled with the spirit of God in their life you can be dealing with with pain but yet you can bring that pain in subjection to God's word praise the Lord you can be dealing with frustration in your mind but you can still bring it under subjection to the promise of God and say let them let the mind be in me that was in Christ Jesus so the most healthy people on Earth today are those with the baptism of the Holy Ghost musicians you can come let's just use the few minutes that is before us we want to thank the Lord for good health we want to pray that God will bring good health to our assembly you'll bring good health to our homes you will make us a people that are grateful for the health that we walk in every day amen the health that we walk in every day science is beginning they are beginning to see a drastic change some people are thinking uh you know what is it is it an effect of the covid or whatever it is but a drastic change you find you find young people in in 30s and 40s you know are experiencing heart failures and you know and and and all sorts of things there there is
