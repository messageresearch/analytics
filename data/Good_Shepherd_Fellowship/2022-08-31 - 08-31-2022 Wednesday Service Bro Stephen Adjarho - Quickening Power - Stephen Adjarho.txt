praise the lord amen shall be seated amen i told one i said it's going to be a short service amen i think we can just say praise god and go home at this point in time amen amen it's good to be in the presence of god i want to use this time to appreciate god for his grace in everyone of yours life i want to also appreciate god for sister naomi you've always been in our prayers um i think when we when we moved our 2016 uh she was she sent us a send us a card and i really cherished that and also the wedding invitation for sister fate and we appreciate that thankful to god tonight i pray god uh bring an awareness upon us that will begin to take us from ourselves and actually begin to give us a true realization because if there is anything we really need we need a true realization we've had we've had enough of religion right and religion have spilled into god's blessings right so if there is anything we need it's just the realization of what god really wanted that's right i think we still have time to to be to be pointing uh at people uh instead of really realizing who we are and so there's a miscommunication somewhere and i pray god tonight that god will give entrance to my heart and to your heart so we can really we can really address the business of god because the business of god has been misunderstood and it's not just it's not just now it has been it has been a pattern that god brings a blessing the blessing is misunderstood and the people that the blessing was uh given to they feel so great and they begin to point fingers on other people condemning other people failing to see that they have not attained the blessing it happened to israel and paul in the book of romans will warn the gentiles which is you and me that don't don't vote don't bows don't both but unfortunately people don't read that scripture to see that warning they say don't both see because you are the you're the white vine that was grafted on the original vine the white olive that was grafted on the original olive it said don't boast because the original olive was cut off and so you've been the wide that was grafted in how do you think you commit the same crime that they committed and you you think you're going to remain there say don't do that say because you're going to be cut off so he saw that by prophecy that the gentiles when they get the blessing that israel had they would be as arrogant as israel because jesus said we are the people of god we are the people of god even when they were rejecting god they were still tapping their chest that we are the people of god even when they took god and nailed him on the cross they said we are god's people and they even told god jump down from the cross and we will see if you are the right thing that you claim so when paul won the gentiles before this thing really swept into where it is today paul warned in the infancy he said don't boast i don't know what scripture i'm going to read tonight but i just feel like going to the book of mark luke chapter 19 i think brother brown will that's not what i want to read but uh as i'm talking that is kind of he's kind of taking me into that right away and he you could see in the book of luke 19 i think that's where he took the story of zacchaeus and before he could take the story of zacchaeus in chapter 18 there was something very unique in chapter 18 that played out in chapter 19 because if you read luke chapter 18 you will see the lord jesus talked about the publican and the pharisee so this way this is what he talked about in chapter 18 and when he spilled into 19 you will now see the story of zacchaeus and if you look at what the bible calls the curse he was called the chief publican he was not just a public guy he has a degree he was a certified publican he he earned his degree as a publican so but if you read chapter 18 the lord was talking about the publican and the pharisee and so when we're not advert into chapter chapter 19 we now saw the chief publican who saw the chief publican and now before we entered into the chief publican there was something so unique there was a pharisee that was something so unique about that pharisee now when you look at that story then you're not diving to the prophet of god shedding light on that buddha brown would tell us what a pharisee mean he said pharisee is an actor that's what abraham said he said pharisee is an actor he knows how to act so but a publican is a man that is living his life he's just a deadly man he's dead into the core so he gave us two categories of people a pharisee this man is an actor he knows the script and it's not just an actor he acts as certain script it's a religious script the script that the pharisee act is a religious script and so that religious script is given to him he acts it to the core that even when you see the real article you're going to choose the actor more than the article itself so but the lord jesus played out the story and showed us the pharisee and he showed us the publican and he would tell us that these two men they went into the temple to pray and while they went into the temple to pray he said the pharisee because he's an actor and he started playing out a script he said lord i pay my tithe is it good he could tap his chest because he was following the script he said i pay my tithe i pay my offering i am not like that baptist brother that is laying on the altar i'm not like that a catholic guy that's laying on the altar confessing this i'm not like that guy at all you see he was standing in god's presence and he had the audacity to justify himself before his creator he was so bold that when he stood before his creator he didn't see need of any it was not communicating he said he stood in the presence of god and was wrecking it was wrecking somebody who came just as he was but he is an actor he's not coming the ways he's telling god i paid my time i pay my offering those were the things he was doing that make him feel where i can tap my chest i am i am worthy of this altar i am wanting to stand here in your presence and he said i'm not i'm not like that guy that is just laying down there and that guy came and when he came to the altar he could you create a song being sung jose i am without one plea and then he lay down on the floor he said god be merciful to me a sinner mercy lord because he he met business he was not coming to say lord give me promotion let my job go well if those things were not part of the discussion on the altar that's not what the author is for the author was not elected to give you job the author was not elected to give you promotion in school the author is not erected to make you have in your classes the author was elected to connect man back aboard [Music] if you want to have air your classes read your book you pass nobody was born out of the mother's womb with a pain i'm telling you the gospel truth nobody was born out of the mother's womb with a chemistry textbook if you read you will pass there is no downside there is nobody that i said don't let nobody tell you that if you study you're going to pass so the author was not made for you to pass chemistry physics have good job that's not what this author is for the other jesus no was not nerd on the cross so you wear good clothes and eat chicken that's the part of it that adam did not fell from eating good chicken i don't fear from a relationship with this creator it was not a bad chicken it wasn't about good clothing it has no connection with that where adam fell from is where we are going back to it's not a good job if i have fun it isn't far from trekking around brooklyn park it didn't fare from renting houses i said well god i can't just stay in rent all my life i need to have my own man so that was not what adam fell from adam fell from a relationship with this creator and so that's where god is taking you and me to back to a relationship with him and this man just came just as he was and lay flat on the altar he said be merciful to me a sinner i tell you what he was having a communication and that's what we want to have when we come to a prayer meeting we want to have communication with god when you have queen with your wife and and things are going rough in your home and you come here and you're like oh lord i pray for the healing option so how can god heal when you are going back home with bitterness in your heart just come the way you are yes amen just come and say let us have priority oh god be merciful to us the blessings of god have become a reproach to the church it has going to be the topic tonight the blessings have become the reproach the blessings of god has become the reproach to the church people coming to the altar and asking for god to touch it bringing the real article to god god i'm i'm about to divorce my wife i'm really angry right now come to the altar that's what is going on amen that is what is going on come to the altar with that and god with that's what god wants you to talk about it's not talking about your job that's not your problem your problem is what is really going on in your heart all those weakeners that dark shadows are revolving in your heart god wants to have that conversation doesn't want you acting up on the seventh c and all that is the real seventh c but i said the seventh c is the end of all things that's right it's the end of time it's the end of the struggling nature is the end of what this struggling nature so that's a struggling nature the end of it is the presence of god discipleship christ coming down to you to have a relationship with you amen let's ask of tonight i've stolen the book of matthew because it's just going to be a short service we've already prayed and we're just going to read the word and we say amen and then we we go home about our business and we bless him for allowing us to be in his presence tonight yeah we're just going to read two scriptures we're going to read matthew chapter 10. i said to you but it's going to be three we're going to read matthew chapter 10 we're going to read the book of mark chapter 3 and then we're going to read the book of luke now those three scripture that's the reason we're going to read them because it's a repetition of the same thing so let's buy our heads dear father we humbly come before your throne of grace yes lord we've come father lord that you may have entrance to our heart lord father we are living in a terrible time and we are also thankful to you lord that you have opened the channel through a message in the hour and you told your prophet right from the very beginning of his ministry you gave him a condition if only thou will be sincere lord's sincerity became the core of the calling not he will be able to stand before your prayer not even cancer lord here we are today we want oh god to pray we want to talk about prayer being answered and we miss the very first condition sincerity so lord may you help us this evening father that we may revert back to the calling to be sincere lord your prophet came to the end of his ministry he said god told me i am not sincere enough he said i have to be more sincere you see i have to fast i have to pray i have to go through purgatory to please myself to be more sincere because god said i am not sincere enough lord which saw the life of that man and lord we know how sincere he was how he tried to do things just the way you told him to lord help us to be sincere this is our heart desire blessed monster we are not here to show ourself how to speak grammar or to show clothing lord we are here to hide under the blood and may there be room at the cross for us father bless your word into our heart the little time we have to spend tonight may your word find interest in our heart in our homes and lead us will go to a revival as a family this reacts oh god in jesus name we pray with thanksgiving amen so we're reading from the book of matthew chapter 10 verse 1. when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness in all manner of diseases amen gave them power to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases we read mark chapter 6 verse 7 and he called unto him 12 and began to send them forth by 2 and 2 and gave them power over unclean spirits he gave them power over unclean spirit now take note of that because that's what we are going to dwell on for the the few minutes that we will have tonight we're going to dwell on that it gave them power over unclean spirit all right that's uh gave them power over on clean spirit and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save staff only no script no bread no money in their pores and also the book of luke luke chapter nine verse one then he called his disciple he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases shall be seated with lord blessing to the reading of his word amen so we find out we're just going to really uh slow down and and and examine those scriptures you find out that we start the scripture uh continuing the message of sunday quickening power you see we most of the time when we when we hear the terminology but abram used to address the same old thing people already they already intellectually interpreted it in their mind and so they feed their emotional bucket as that world is coming quickly power they're jumping but they don't really understand what quickening power is because everybody has an understanding of what they think it means but we have to allow the world to tell us what quickly the power is so uh jesus took home to him 12 disciples and when he called his 12 disciples the bible said in matthew 10 and when he according to him his twelve disciples he gave them power now i'm going to really spare time a little bit to emphasize here but you used the word it gave them power against unclean spirit now take that word against now when you say against it means there is a combat involved it's war right now you're going to see how why this this people they tell the same story but they use different descriptions there's a purpose for it because the different description this theory uh uh uh peace to use they have a dealing on how god wanted to handle this devil in your life you're gonna see it so matthew in in his way of writing he would say this way and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirit now i'm giving you a task tonight when you go home put your message search and type the word unclean spirit you see because we we've gone where the days when you are trying to read the quotes to go give somebody no no no he's reading for yourself now because you at this world this is all about you this is all about you you are this way it's all about you all the struggle and the struggle to preach it's all about you because you and the world ephesians 4 will tell us that the five-fold ministry is giving what the identification to bring you it is about you it has zero to do with the ministry it's you it's all about you it's god trying to show you something and what god is trying to show you sister he's trying to show you yourself in the bible and people have missed that we see spending time on the historical the historical part of our journey our journey as a body of christ has historical part paul is history in our journey peter is his story in our journey this is the present tense of the journey that we are in but abram is history in our journey see that is strange yes it's history in our journey and so when you begin to dwell in history and you refuse to move with what god wants to move with you miss where you going to now we are going somewhere and where are we going to we are going to the image of the world we are going to be that world how can we be that one we don't know we are that's why god sent the prophet so that the prophet can carry you by the scripture open the scripture to you so you can see yourself when the prophet opened the scripture we were able to see him and a lot of people stop right there brother one they stopped right there i seen buddha bro now how many of us believe that buddha brahma is the prophet in here tonight raise up your hand okay yeah i just went down all of it sorry what's wrong with that before i turn around there i didn't even see who raised up your hand amen yeah keep that that's i wanted to call your name bro because because these days we don't know who is who anymore yes so we are free we are free to express ourselves amen so that's i'm talking about the history that is history that you believe that abraham is a prophet it's easy it doesn't mean you are a christian they never believe you before you were born amen that's right you see these are the things that we begin to use to tap our chest and we feel that we are bright that does not make you bright [Music] never believed that same thing he knows it before you were born the devil knows that that for abraham is malacca for he knows it so but abram is malacca for that's not an argument there are so many of us right now if they were to bring some men with ammunition maybe m16 i said now say it do you believe what the brahman is the prophet write that himself and it's my father i believe it i i just come to church i have to be obedient to my parents i'm there with my father that's him behind you my father is right there at the backseat the back row that's my dad right there say pat can you tell him that you're the one that brought me to church you know how i used to respond you you brought me here that's what they will say but i tell you the fact when you wreck that thing there are some people that will die believing that brother abraham is a prophet because it was not told to them they caught the revelation but that is not the zenith but that's not the zenith of what we're going to do because god did not send for abraham so you will believe that i said prophet that was not that was not with the brahms ministry but the bran's ministry was not to tell you that he's a prophet that's not his ministry but the brown's ministry was to get christ a bride that was his ministry so believing that i say prophet doesn't make you anything right now by believing who you are by the word that he preached that make you something yes [Music] the problem that paula brown ministry have with the pentecostal world today anytime you stumble online they acknowledge that he was a great man of god because they have seen great men of god before but what they have never seen they have never seen a man of god that takes scriptural identity it has never happened right even paul himself did not take scriptural identity have you read any part in your bible say malacca spoke about me it's not in the bible did you read any reports say joshua spoke about me it's not in the bible but paul knew that he was an apostle but he never took a scriptural identity in the altar he never did because in paul's day there was no new testament the bible ended in malacca paul never pointed himself in any of those scripture he never you would not say to your bible even though he was the first messenger of the age he never showed himself this is me he never did that but here comes a ministry that we have never seen that time before now because that ministry was oh god help me tonight that means it was christ christ coming down to show people that i'm here and so the only way he could do it he has to send a ministry they have a scriptural identity that that ministry have to be showing you it's not telling you i have no if you begin to see that ministry in peace to prayers to pray to peace from the old testament into the new you could see that meaning sunday but that's not the end of the story that solidify your faith that you are following the right person now when you know you are following the right person the journey has not started yet you are solidified i'm following the right person now when the person that you are following now tells you that you are in the world your turn is complete you have seen the man you are following has shown you himself in the world he has sold himself in the world and then when he brings his message he said the message is you brother oh glory to god and then you tell me that i i i will no longer believe the message the message is me how can i deny it i cannot am i crazy i can be poor but i'm not crazy right i had no hope something came to show me that i am in god's bible and you are telling me that that thing is false that's right what can you show me about myself what what can you show me about myself i tell you what even your father cannot show you the best about yourself your mother cannot show you the best about yourself but you become a message that is showing you the best about yourself and somebody is telling you that that message is false cloud did not appear declared smoke this is okay if rockets show me why i am in the bible i believe that rocket right i have to believe that rocket if a rocket shows you who you are in god's word you have to believe that rocket she's a jet smoke if a jet smoke show me who i am in my bible i would be so stupid not to believe that yet spoke yeah because the jasmine did not show me who i am in america he showed me who i am in the bible i will believe that smoke after a burning bush showed moses who moses walked out so if a burning bush could show moses whom was this was why won't i believe in a jedi if a jet smoke showed me who i am because moses for 80 years this man was running he thought he was a general he thought he was the head of the egyptian navy he thought was the head of the egyptian air force all those were just what he thought because their muscles were still flowing you know what i'm saying but when was 80 years old all those muscles were sagging he was no more than master man that was on this picture that he was putting on facebook now he look old wagged out and there was nothing so great about him he was not a handsome man anymore at that point in time he saw a bunny bush that showed him beyond all of that and showing who he really is praise be to god we're going to stay true to the message we're going to stay treated so we're going to try to close quickly so in verse verse 1 of matthew 10 matthew said and when he had called on to him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirit this is what dragged me into all of that now i said when you go home tap on clean spirit in your message search and when you tap on clean spirit look at your life those things but the brown call on clean spirit look at your life if they are there that's an assignment when you tap on clean spirit look don't see you but abraham is calling on clinton look at your life and see if they are there and if they are there they will start from matthew 10 1. and it gives you power and gains and this means there is war now in the media of portland oregon the maniac when that maniac came he said i'm going to i'm going to break every bones in your body right and buddha say you're going to bow down before me because you've come to challenge god and he said we're going to see who who invited them before and he lifted up his head but the message that man was so big that he could equal security straight because he has been broken the jaws of ministers he goes on the platform beat up the minister break all their bones and go his way but he met god he met god with a little man and when he raised up his son and was coming he fell down and he bowed down before brother brown and they asked for abraham that's why we're coming to matthew 10 1. but abraham wasn't delivered but abraham said no you know why but i'm not saying he loved that devil that's right he said wasn't that devil he worshiped that devil and when you worship your anger you're washing your temper you worship your loss you worship your pride they will still remain in you you could be a preacher you could be a strong leader those devils will be in you they are caught unclean spirit and you are supposed to be against them when you are against something that is where oh god help me let me read that again when you are against something then you will do exactly what matthew 10 say listen what you can say listen and he gave them power against on screen spirit to do what cast them out to do what yes when you hate something that's when you cast that thing out they say to take them out when you when you are casting out some you are angry you you are upset with that thing sarcastic my child that child was giving you some crazy mess get out of this house you put some tone to it hey johnny johnny get out that is so busy right now but when the tool changes and there's gravity behind it that is casting out you are really upset with what is going on and the bible say give them what power the power he gave you is to be against anything unclean in your life don't worry about the next man because that's how we misunderstand that scripture oh we're just going to lay hand cast out of place but no no no it is in your life right now watch for the full rescue slowly because when you've done that to cast an unclean spirit to be against unclean spirit to cast them out that the power that god give you is not to do anything but to be against the unclean spirit in your life and to send them parking to cast them out and after you have cast them see the way the scripture arrange it we're talking about healing healing there's no healing before you go into the step of the healing you must also forecast that the unclean spirit once unclean spirits have been casted out then there's no condemnation in your heart and the dog said if our heart condemns us not then we know that god outside us then you can pray from your heart at that point in time you can pray freely but you have to first of all cast out every ugly spirit you should be against them now might use the word against so much you set a war with this unclean spirit he sat there he he opened a warfront that you had to war with them he opened the war front now this is how mark who said max 6 7 and he called on to him the 12th and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirit now watch that word over now to be against your fighting war to be over it means you are controlling him to be against his war now when you now have power over you are controlling you're in control so the power that god is giving you is to control that's why person modify your members bring them under control come on brother break them on everybody in this church this evening you are all pastors so don't blame your pastor because your own congregation they are running you crazy come on brother at least your pastors here have congregations of believers you know what i'm saying jordan you have congregation your own congregation they will never be saved that's what the bible said the bible says notify the members of your assembly the members the only commandment god gave you to your own church members is to bring them under control they will not be safe lost fornication these are devils yeah they are very ugly you will never be able to save them but you have to bring them under control to bring them under control so god said notify what your pastor know the members of your own congregation the members of your body so you are the pastor and you have members these are reckless members they can run you crazy they are crazy members and they make you crazy at times at times when people look at you they see your members right they say this is your member because someone will run you this way they run you that way they're going this way because you are failing to do what the scriptures say bring them under control and that's what mac is saying here that's why i say say he has gave them power over oh i love this let's say together and give them power over overwatch unclean spirits unclean spirit but abram said jesus cast that seven words unclean spirit from who mary magdalene now take time and read those seventies see you have to be honest to yourself you're gonna see them in your life so if put abraham call them devils in this woman why do you think that they are not devils in you you see when those same spirits are in you you call them say this society if you just offend me this i don't come to church again this is just how my my nature is that's how i used to do this brother it's an unclean spirit it's not how you are you are trying to deceive yourself to begin to believe that this unclean spirit is you it's not you that's right these are intelligence they speak the reason and they begin to break into your memory tell you the way pastor talked to me the way sister and naomi looked at me uh the way she's affected my point i think i do every time i did like this and they were suffering that is an intelligence talking to you that's not you thinking it is an intelligence talking to you let's say praise the lord we're going to come to this a few quotes like i said i'll keep a promise we're going to close i'm just going to read luke and then we're just going to read some few quotes and then we'll close the mission can come up just to let you know that we're going to close amen that's an assurance all the musicians can come up amen and just start playing so they will believe that we are actually close amen yes we have to do so soon you have the message i just wanted to know that god will continue uh it won't fall the remaining part to you because it is all about you it's not there's no great thing it's not all about dress well or try there's nothing i'm going to say that will change you but if god can open a channel for you to see who you really are that's all your pastor brother [Music] val and all the ministry that comes around that's what the genuine minister is struggling to do is to show you who you are it's gonna show you me what is me if you look at my journey i have gone through bumps but that thing that kept me and show me who i really am that's all you need to see who you really are because you're hearing another voice that is telling you this is not who you are you can't make it you're not going to go to heaven this is all about heaven and hell this is about identity who am i that's right but abram said in the message a trumpet gives an uncertain sound 1963 but abram said no he said none of god's children we go to hell i was listening to that a few weeks ago coming from work i was just sharing with your brother and asking me a question that struck me so deep i have never in all my christian journey i have never looked at it that way i kind of look at the word of the lord jesus he said hell was created for the devil and his angels i never looked at it that way before that instructed me really deep i said what am i reading hell is created for the devil and his angels i said a process said why have i not seen this all my life sister kelly why have i not seen this is it the devil and his angels that's the people god created helpful god does not make mistakes in the politics of america you could be voting for a democrat a republican ticket can fall in there but when god created hell he created it for the devil and his angel nothing more we fall in there that's the word of the lord jesus himself and i was telling his brother i said it kind of sounds strange to him like oh bruh if you want to bring a new tissue no this is your bible i said that's the lord jesus that said it before we're going to walk with the brain we say [Music] it's a norm of it's not bountiful not of god's children we enter there he said it was created for the devil and his children and i asked his brother i said brother when anything asset of the devil's children enter ahead he was kind of stumped he said i say it's not the trickiest question it's just as simple as i said there's no trick it is because maybe you think that there's this there's a bigger bigger fish to fry me i know there's nothing behind it's just as simple as i'm saying i said is there any other person that would be in hell beside the devil and his children he said uh i said but i don't don't stop it it's a simple question [Music] would there be any other person in health beside the devil and his children i said brother let me just help you the answer is no i said now let me not tell you where we where we should ask a question who's tired are you [Music] when you answer that question of what side you are then you are no more worried about hell anymore that's not the story we're talking about and that's why god sent a prophet to show you who you are and then when you can see who you are and you can know your father then you know where you're going to you are not going there because you are good you are not going there because you can pray you are not going there because you pay your tax you must pay your title for a christian you must be interested very christian you must be praying for your blessing but that is not all of it is because you know who you are quickening power did that [Music] god sent onto us [Music] power against all unclean spirits to be against them to be over them and to cast them out to cast them out he didn't say to call by the brown to help you out no to cast them out [Music] but abraham has done his job he has left a message and he said put it on tapes there's a reason for that because somebody could come and tell you something different but now you can listen to those tapes and you are seeing yourself clearly you are not saying for the brown you already believe he's a prophet so you're not seeing him again he said that part is history for you but now you are not seeing yourself through the eye of the prophet god sends to you and you can look at the bible you can see yourself in every story [Music] now we are not reading the bible like like we read in pentecost i said something somebody was shocked i said when you read about judas you will see yourself there see brussels and you're going too far no you will see yourself in judas and you see what messi did for you what did you guys do he saw christ is that what he did how many times have you sowed christ [Music] we are talking about now we are on the altar now we are not actors how many times have you sold christ when you read the bible and you read about account you see yourself in anchor but the only thing you see you see what mercy did for you so when you're reading the story of ekka you say mercy you say mercy when you restore your beloved you say oh lord mercy another quote from the brahman said i committed the same crime but i'm committed that's what abram said yes many times god told me to do this i did my own thing that's what i said so you see when you see yourself in every positive and negative story in the bible you will see yourself in every story some of those stories will humble you someone will lift you up so we knock you to the ground i crumble your boats and your big me we go down solo meeting like a candle wasp and i say oh lord [Music] the lie to god how many times have you lied in the church and yeah you are not singing i love him they didn't have a second privilege to sing i love him peter said they're going to pack your dead body where you are you're saying i love him so as you read every page in the bible some parents will lift you up so we humble your pride so we lift you up again your pride will be humble so you are going to journey up and down up and down what is happening god is more than you he's pounding you sending you through the fiery corners so now all your acting begin to fade away the real beginning to come out and when you step into that door you come into the ass of god you're not looking at blasting stephen's face you're not looking at your wife's face you are coming right here boom you say god i just look lostfully at this woman today you're talking to god you're not talking to somebody you are talking to god you're having a conversation with your king you say lord i don't feel like coming to church today but i begin to lose desire to be among your children they begin to irritate me you bring it right here one of the oldest sacrifice in the bible is the point of offering and that's where the church has failed oh but i want to pay my attention so what we're failing about suffering because a burnt offering is the only offering that comes in contact with fire sister naomi fire has to come in contact with it we put a delight there for it we put all can offerings we give him afraid of praise we're giving off not this and nothing of that but the burnt offering we fell in the boundary when we are coming to the church maybe the devil is telling you kill yourself kill yourself kill yourself and you keep that spirit outside when you are coming in so you can pack it home successfully but you know what you need to do god wants you to come with your blunt offering just as i am come with your loss come with your pride come with your arrogance bring them to the altar because the fire of god has to leak on that sacrifice the fire of god to lick on your pride it had to leak on all those devils holding some clean spirit let us rise on this hour [Music] oh hallelujah glory to god [Music] oh [Music] do you're my friend lord you are my brother [Music] i want you to but abram's service in the message prophet faith you become the word as you receive the word if you
