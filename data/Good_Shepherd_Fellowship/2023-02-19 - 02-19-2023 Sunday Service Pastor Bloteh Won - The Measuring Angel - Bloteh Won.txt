47. Ezekiel chapter 47. I think I'm having to get around there quickly or as I run into crisis praise the Lord um Ezekiel chapter 47 let me quickly grab let's read from verse 1. let's read from verse 1 Ezekiel chapter 47 reading from verse 1. afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold Waters issue out from under the threshold of the house Eastward praise the Lord and you know the the the Tabernacle the front part of the Tabernacle was always facing East so let me I just want to give you a mental picture so you can you can picture this is this is like this is a vision that Ezekiel is talking about yeah just to create a picture in your mind so uh uh uh this house was uh type of the temple you know what his word so water issue out from under the threshold of the house Eastward from from the Forefront of the house too towards the east and the water came down from under from the right side of the house to the south side of the altar then brought he me out of the weight of the get northward and led me about the way without to get by the way that looketh Eastward and behold they ran out Waters on the right side and when the man the heart the line in his hands when fought his word he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters and the waters were to the uncle again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters and the waters were told their knees again he measured its housing and brought me in true the waters he brought me through the waters were to the lens now and if you pictured in your mind uh Ezekiel in this vision is led by an Angel and a measuring Angel and as the angel is bringing him into the water this water that is gauching out from from art from out of the temple from the threshold of the temple is coming out and as as the angel brings him every thousand uh uh measurement the water coming from his uh his his angle to his knees and to his looms and uh and and afterward verse 5 he measured a thousand and and it was a river that I could now pass over for the water were raising Waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over praise the Lord so almost another sense is that this this water that was gulching out swept him from off his feet and there was no no more time for walking it was time to swim amen praise the Lord let's go to Revelation chapter 11. Revelation chapter 11 we will take one verse from there and then I will allow you to sit while I remain standing praise the Lord is that not the truth you say that remain standing Revelation chapter 11 let's read verse 1. and there was giving me a read like onto Iran and the angel still saying rise and measure the temple of God their altar and them that word and then their worship they're in I want to read that again and there was giving me a reef like onto a road and they injured still saying rise and measure the temple of God the Altar and them that worship now you have to realize three things I measure you the temple is measured the altar is measured the worshipers I measure praise the Lord chapter 21 . I say I was going to allow you to sit but it looks like you didn't want it to so I would keep you up again for uh for one more verse verse 15 21 verse 15. this is about the holy city verse 15. and he and he that talked with me had a golden Reed to measure the city that gets thereof and the walls there are three things I also measured here let us pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we We Just Want to Thank You Lord we want to thank you and appreciate you Lord father for how much you've been good to us how much Lord you've been very good to us and dear Lord we want to place your word in your hands this morning I ask the Lord God you will you will set us aside Lord and oh God uh found their Channel this morning to be able to breathe upon your children Lord bring for your word this morning Lord Garden that we will be able to find Grace in your sight bless us Lord Jesus as our brother pray this morning father bless blessed Lord oh god father the the second minus Lord those that are not feeling well may you touch them Lord God those that couldn't be with us this morning because of one reason we just place them in your hands we love you we thank you Father Lord God and uh uh but Ben Taurus his wife should be traveling back we want to play sister Alice in your hands that you you give her the safe trip back home we love you in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed and a couple of months back another month what am I saying months years I appreciate I preached this message here uh on the measuring injury but uh uh there was something that was happening to my to my my iPad one time it kind of freeze I mean a setting up kind of frees on me and then I had I had I had some of my notes in their app it's one of my study abs and I was trying to move it up and down so I was trying to be smart I said okay well so since you want to behave like this I would delete you and reinstall you you know and uh and I deleted the app and uh and and reinstall the app and then when I did and when I did uh I reinstalled the app it started working I went I went back to go and find my notes they were all gone so uh I lost it somewhere in the clouds so I was thinking about this uh back there in in South Africa that's one of the brothers that had a great greet the meeting before I speak and then he came up and then he read uh uh revelation 11 and when he read it the thought hit my mind I said yeah I think uh that that calling shot with the measuring injure and so I went back and started looking for my notes and then I realized oh God it's gone it's it's somewhere there in the cloud but uh I started thinking about it there were a few things that came in my heart and I thought that well I might go back and preach on the measuring engine my note is gone but the Holy Ghost amen and we just need to find an inspiration and the Lord will bless it so we will be speaking on the measuring angel this morning yeah [Music] and we have to realize that we are dealing with a god of precision a God that loves measurement a God that loves measurement is a god of measurement and uh uh as we as you look into the scripture you will see that it's all over the scripture okay before I go any father into what I want to talk about I just want to remind us that uh we will have a brother maleko from the UK he's descended from uh Zimbabwe but a pastoring over in the UK so we were having the weekend of March 10 11 and 12 so if you want to put that down on your calendar and and prayed and that the Lord will be able to to uh just be able to help us and give us a time and uh there were some few things that I wrote down here that I wanted to to get into before I get into my message so just bear with me a little bit I wanted to announce this so just put that down uh there's uh March 10 through 12 the Wednesday of that week we will now have service so we can be able to have our services on the weekend and uh there is something that has been going on uh if you if if you're actually been following the news so uh you know keeping yourself updated with uh things that are happening uh there there are a lot of religious things that have been going on uh I've been following this uh news of a group of people that have been looking close into California uh prophecy and it was very strange that uh this person that was that was uh pulling up these things was able to look at few people that have prophesied about California thinking and uh and and uh and they also talk blood brand and prophecy as an outstanding prophecy concerning californium and uh and also uh uh uh the there's a big religious persecution that's that's been happening around you know uh in most part of the word Indian India is having the big one there uh the the government being cracking down on churches and different things and uh Brad told me the the churches in um even in the bamako area there's uh Burkina Faso that's that's West Africa they have been having some some problems there so I mean they have different things that just been happening around that people have been keeping close eyeshadow and uh and you know and and but another one there's there's turned out to become something big around the religious world in America is uh is over in Kentucky and turkey and now I think this is going into the second week now uh there is there is a university a Christian University it is actually a Methodist University that was the University there brother uh Omen evil came from ominiva actually came from that University and uh that University was is actually started right after John Wesley Revival you know when uh when when John Wesley started preaching and uh you know uh the the Wesley Revival of sanctification started hitting you know the the world from England they came over to the uni to the United States and you know uh it was after that that they started that University there but it has a history it has a history of of of an outbreak of of uh Revival experience and uh when I look at I was looking into that let me see if I can is the houseboro university in Kentucky uh it's in a little city called Wilma Wilma in Kentucky and uh it has its history go as far back as to 1905. and now that's their Revival history 1905 1908 1921 1950 1958 1970 was one of the one that is known it's known because that 1970 Revival spread out you know it was it was a big thing in uh in in the U.S and it started hitting different universities campers you know and all of that and I was listening to uh one of the guys that were that was leading the University at a time I think he was the dean or one of the the the the guys that were there uh Dr King Lord and he was he was testifying he has gone over to Canada and why he was over in Canada uh you know the thing called him that you know those universities they would have Chopper you know they would have Chopper every morning they would get in their Chopper and someone will speak and then from there speaking uh uh you know they were prayed and they would do their Chapel thing and this it happens that this morning uh back there in 1970s after Chopper you know uh they started praying and the praying just went on they would not stop they just kept praying and kept praying and kept praying and kept praying you know and the thing called Dr King's law and says we have a problem you know and uh uh Dr King's law was worried what you know what's going on you know he says Chopper Chopper will not stop you know Chopper keep going on you know so uh but the the background the background of this is that a ah is it actually started as as a burden now remember now because this this University have had a history of uh of of an outbreak of Revival and movement among them it has it has always created that Crave in the hearts of the people to always experience something you know so there will be there will be a time where the but I I call into that I took uh King's law he says it actually started from a young lady that had a burden you know so they started a small group of just six person and uh and uh they decided that every morning they would get together and pray for 30 minutes they would just have their own uh uh you know uh time together prayed and steady whatever time they're just they're just devoted 30 minutes every morning for 30 days you know they were they were being accountable to one another you know and you know and they were just they were just gathered together and you know talk about their experience you know confess their weaknesses they have struggled to one another you know and all of that so at the end of their 30 days they went to Chopper and then they started testifying of their experiences and they decided they had to you know all of those six each one now will start a group of six on their own you know uh so it was it was uh you know six times six group that started and on and only went with that until this fateful day of February uh Ted 1970 but February 2nd while they were having their their morning devotion you know uh you know they will always ask one another do you do you do you believe that we can you know we we can do you believe that we can have an experience you know and then one of the young man says he says that this place is so you know uh uh I'm feeling so blessed and I think that this thing is going to happen and definitely on the third they have that outbreak but one of the things that struck me as I was I was I was looking today is I've been looking through it the entire week I mean uh the university I mean all through the week I mean people from all over the country has been going to Can Turkey uh uh because of what is happening there now there is a whole lot of a mix I'm saying this to be able to bring you to a place there's a whole lot of a mix you know but uh there was something that Dr King's King law said that that you know that interests me in that I appreciate it he said you know uh this this this whole thing started because of an Earnest dealing with personal sin disobedient and personal problems it was not it was not uh a kind of for everybody think it was few individuals that felt that the need to address some things in their lives if the god of the Bible is truth they wanted to experience him oh man yes praise the Lord you know and uh [Music] I mean what do we do most of the time I remember if if some of you remember brother brother Vincent that was with us here the professor he he's over in Indiana teaching one of those universities so one one uh you know one time all the professors they were asking because they are only Christians professors that teach at those universities so that we give them an opportunity to speak so I think uh they gave him an opportunity one time to speak and then he called me on the phone you know he wanted me to listen to his uh his exhortation that morning called me on the phone and said well brother one you have to pray for me you know uh I'm having this uh uh time here to to be able to speak so they do all of that but then what happened after that is that they gave you know opportunity to the young students to come and tell their experience and and and when they come up to tell their experience you know they are dealing with with personal things you know and and even even what is going on there now now not at the University right now as you and myself are talking you know I mean people have been having all night staying all night you know on uh down there and what is going on now is the other you know uh all of these young people crying out you know uh uh uh publicly you know uh uh confessing their thoughts of uh those are struggling with smoking you know vaping pornographic and all of the adages you know uh crying out you know and uh uh and one thing he says is that the emphasis was not on the gift of the of the spirit the emphasis was on repentance and confession you see that was the thing that was missing in the Pentecostal Revival because the emphasis was on the gift praise the Lord and and and and the thing about it there is that the people that are still struggling with sin can be gifted amen they can be gifted they can be anointed but yet they can be possessed praise the Lord now so you see yeah uh and and what is happening here you know that I'm completely sidetracking here but I pray that the holy spirit will bring everything together and uh but what is happening here is the other uh you have some people other people too that are standing back and being a little bit critical of everything that is going on there and I will tell you a big bunch of data people around the message and uh uh uh you know when when you know when you see the uh you know a community like that of uh of young people you know uh I mean you look at the address code and you look at the the way they are you says well that cannot be God you know and and and here is it we have all the dress called but we dress scene in necktie we dress scene in decency praise the lord we put the Bible on our arm and then we can play out all the religious God and yet instead we are burning on the scene amen I think I would want to go to a place like that where people are confessing they are saying to be able to gain the courage and say God help me help me I need you praise the Lord then for me to stand back and see the young lady crying and say well see the way she dresses I cannot be God said praise the Lord there is a lot of controversy about it yeah I mean I don't you know the thing about it there is that I would tell you if you have not experienced a Revival you don't know what it is if you have really never experienced a Revival you don't know what it is glory be to God amen a Revival like brother Brown Shades is it's a time of cleaning out it's a time of purging praise the lord it's a time of purging where you are desperately in need of God is yeah the the the grace of God is helping you to identify things in your life and you want to get rid of it praise the Lord you want to get rid of it so that was what the experienced in uh 1970 that was one of the biggest outbreak there uh uh uh at the Asbury University and I mean it was you know there's a big move on there you can follow a lot of a lot of documentary on there and then they had another one again in in 1992 2006 and it looks like this one they have in this year is it's a big thing now you have to you have to realize you know uh people can only walk in the measure of the word that is given to them praise the Lord they can only walk in the measure of the word that is given to them praise the Lord and and and that that Revival uh uh uh you have to know uh uh the the the the the Wesley Revival was all about sanctification it was about uh uh uh you know cleansing it was about identifying confessing you know and cleansing and and when when I when I listened to the report that are coming from out of there I said I says they are just under the shadow of their Revival even though the time of their Revival has passed but they are just under the shadow you see God is uh uh uh you cannot put God In The Box you can put God In The Box praise the Lord amen no doubt there there are many that are going to come out of there after they have gone through all of their they are going to come out of there and and they are going to struggle with different things because brother Branham taught us he said when when God moves the devil moves also okay you have all of these all of these uh celebrity coming down from uh California you know all of these ones that are into gospel music that are all you know that they have sort themselves out to the devil you know and they are all trying to go into the meeting there and identify with that you know some are going to criticize and they're just a mix of spirits hmm praise the Lord but you see this the thing then is that that the the the the the shoe grab our attention is that uh you know if if if uh if if there's a group of people that are out crying out for God amen where should we be where should we be we can be playing Church if there's a group of people that are crying out for for for the Holy Ghost and in media I mean they are crying out for God to be real to them and we have a professing bride of Jesus Christ for the rapture praise the Lord it's not something that's happened 10 years ago is something that is happening right now as I'm speaking to you from this pulpit are we together praise the Lord I've just been praying I'm I'm saying Lord uh just just do something for us you know we get we get to that place of uh of uh of all the things that we know we started with all of these things you know brother Brian said there will be no National Revival Burbank says you know what the Revival is over but balances we we know all of those all of those things are just intellect you can put God In The Box amen you can put God In The Box all I'm saying is the other if uh if those people are crying now for God if the Deep color too deep there is a deep to respond we can have the kind of a attitude careless attitude that we have towards the things of God and then criticize people that are wanting more of God if you don't want more of God get out of the way that's right praise the Lord so we want to look at this this uh measuring Angel as I said put on your calendar we will have uh Crosby with us in the March 10 11 and 12. so uh I hope you remember that now we will remind you as we go back we want to look at this we want to look at this and and uh talking on the on the measuring engine brother Branham used their scripture that Ezekiel scripture in the message uh the sadisan church age now when he read that Ezekiel 47 he said this he says and the way that it was done was by God's perfect way and programming now he's using the angel taking Ezekiel you know to to to the water that is pouring out out of the temple from the threshold of the temple the angel is taking Ezekiel in us as Ezekiel goes towards the water the angel we measure there is a measure that is given and that measure is just as far as his uncle now Barbarian would take that and and and make us to understand how every age got a measure of God praise the Lord so he would take that now he's he's taking that that vision of Ezekiel to be able to to make us to understand how there was a measure given to every age he says and that he says and the way that it was done was by God's perfect will and God's programming there the Lutheran heart the Holy Ghost potentially on a justification it was a measure that was just at the ankle level praise the Lord are we together he says the motherless heart is potentially on the sanctification and today is brought back a restoration that's the pentecustom the Holy Ghost is here are we together amen so it was the ankle leveled and the need and then the limbs but when the angel took him to the next level is sweping off his feet he had to swim his way through [Laughter] praise the Lord amen I don't know what level you are praise the Lord brother bam says yeah he says Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain it that are ready to die that's that's that's uh that's talking to that church age now the idea now the idea Express in the two words watchful and strengthened at least to wash contain not only the idea of being awake but to be alert to be otherwise anything with a danger and loss so strengthen means more than just to give strength a means to be fixed and established for permanency are we together these two commands refer to what is left of the truth which itself is ready or about to die now brother Branham is describing the sadism Church age to make us to see that the truth in that age was about to die out but the spirit called out to thy age and say Be watchful amen and strengthen what you have praise the Lord and then what what a time we can bring there because we realize that everything that affects all the church ages comes right down to our age praise the Lord amen it comes down to our age so we can even apply that to our age when we see how uh uh uh uh the churches are dying out and we see that uh you know there's there's a very poor example of of Christianity all of those things now the little truth that you have the the the the the the the place where the Lord has quickened the word to you to make the the message real or to make the coming of the Lord real why not you strengthen it praise the lord it's not supposed to be just a head knowledge it's supposed to be something that is influencing our life are we together this expression of the spirit comes before me as an illustration you know he is going to uh bring it into uh a little illustration here where he's talking about uh you know a group of people in bondage physically and uh uh and and trying to find a way to get out of there to escape out of there but uh let's let's move on yet a little bit Wednesday night we uh uh you know we we use this quote over in invisible Union where brother Branham says but watch when the spiritual bride when she begin to have a Revival when she began to come back and line herself up with the word of God and our emphasis Wednesday night was that is the bride Revival stay in line praise the Lord stay in line that's the bride Revival to keep in line the every effort we make to line up our life and line up ourselves with the word of God you are being in Revival because what was that uh a word did in Revelation chapter 3 uh uh uh uh uh to to them that I love amen amen what was the crowd of the spirit repent amen that was the Cry of the spirit to them that I love and I trust him the spirit cried was to repent so brother bear I'm saying here is that uh when when when that spiritual bride begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the world watch again and and you see how that the scripture at that time there will be a message that would sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman the Elitch praise the Lord for us the words sit on the deceiver who deceive the first bride to sinning against God by misbelieving his word now today as we see the church natural in in your intellectual gospel Glory father and father from the word in social groups we find them we we find that the woman of the word on the street members of such carrying themselves in the same atmosphere praise the Lord you can tell them they they have lost all sense of common decency and the people and that's the way it is uh the church has and you can see it going straight to the incommunical council just as setting as anything in the word and right into room as hard as they can go see cause it's prophesied Amen that's her behavior but then watch again the spiritual church how how that group of people call out elect through every Revival if in in in in Martin Luther time it happened just the same way in the in the Reformation it happens the same thing just like in John Wesley time it happened the same thing and when Pentecostal started what was happening bringing the people back to the word amen amen that's what was happening bringing the people back to line up with the word now so when we look at the the what I want to for us to to uh to do it on uh grab your attention here is that uh just like how the angel in uh uh Ezekiel was taking Ezekiel uh uh through this flood of water that have break out of the threshold from the temple and and the angel was taking him and and in every step he had a he had a measurement he had an experience you know on his ankle his knee his lungs and then he got to the place where he was overwhelmed you know he was taking off his feet he had to swim his way through now God was just showing Ezekiel the outpouring of the spirit how he was going today with his people by measure in every age praise the Lord Amen in every age there was going to be an outpouring of God's spirit to be able to bring his people back brother Baron says in a message Oneness he says that's the reason why the Holy Ghost was pulled out he was God Gathering his children back to himself he says that great big Pillar of Fire distributed himself and and and and and there was clothing tongues on on everyone head they had a little bit of that fire it was it was almighty God Gathering himself back to himself praise the Lord now so but if you look over here in Revelation chapter 11 now you have to see that this is right after Revelation chapter 10 where it talks about the mystery of God being revealed it talks about the seven angel now Revelation 10 comes you have to realize it's the same Angel The Mighty angel that is the measuring angel the measuring angel in every age is the mighty angel now so here in Revelation chapter 11 there was giving me a read like unto a road the angels to sing rise and measure the temple measure the altar and the worshipers therein so the temple have a measurement the altar represents the word it has a measurement yes now the worshipers also should be measured what does that mean it means that God has a standard he has a standard of how he want the temple to be he gave Moses a precise measurement praise the Lord if he was when he was going to to to to to drown the word in the time of Noah when he called Noah and gave Noah a magic a message that message had a measurement of how the ACT should be the length of the eye the weight of the Ark praise the Lord amen it's not everything goes no God has a precise way that he want things and until things meet that measurement he cannot bless it praise the Lord amen he gave us measurements our years upon the Earth our Heights and all of that he's a god of measurement there's a way that God wants things to be done there's a way he wants us to order our life the temple had a measurement he told Moses give him a vision for him to build the temple I call into the vision that he saw it in the mountain and when Moses came down he came with this pattern the temple had to be measured you you see that in the building of the temple uh qubit year you know and and this cubic year and this length Year God was very precise and God is very precise how he will get us in the rapture he's not going to take your measurement or how you want to get in the rapture praise the Lord amen God is very precise how we must run this church he's very precise if he's going to dwell in this place if he's going to bless what is done here it must be done by his measurement God is very precise how you must run your home yes praise the Lord Murder band says in a message spoken word is the Original Seed he said if you want a church start with the word praise the Lord don't stop with the people it's not the people that makes the church is the word that makes a church it's not the amount of people that miss the church if you want to start a church it's not how much instrument you have praise the Lord it's not it's not about the the the high-rise building you have you don't start by building the building a building you start with the word you'll wanna when join the Baptist started after stepping out of all of those years from the Wilderness his first message was repaint because that has been the the the groundwork to every Revival if we were if we would ever experience God in our life we must go back to the basic of repentance there's God's measuring Rock to turn people around if we will be if we would turn around and have any experience of turning around in our life the way God's measurement for that is repentance are we together if you want a church he said start with the word if you want a life of God start with the word if you want to experience God start with the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God when God wanted to start a creation he started with his word let there be it was the beginning of all things we cannot leave the principle of the word and expect to be blessed we can leave the principle of the word and expect to be blessed praise the Lord that he didn't make their gods and make the rules that govern their gods Our God make us and give us his root that govern our life praise the Lord amen if you have a god different from the one that we are serving here take him outside because there's no place for him here praise the Lord hear people when they want to be stuck in their ways and when they come to church to accept my God carry your God outside because the God Will Save here he's governed by this Bible he's not governed by your idea he's gone by this word if you want a livestock with the word accept the word of God in his fullness praise the Lord accept the word of God in his fullness every measure of it praise the Lord God has a measurement even the Bible it talks about our faith there's a Measure of Faith that is given to us there is a measure of Grace that is given to our dispensation praise the Lord when the people in the days of Noah choose to go after their own hearts and get get themselves into everything that God himself involved they stretch out God's grace to that ancient time and the spirit of God with no no longer strive with man whatever we want to start it must be with the word we must start with the word amen amen you cannot you cannot despise God's word you can now Trump God's word under your feet especially when God has opened his word to you and Truth has been revealed to you and the spirit of God is dealing with your heart praise the Lord amen all you are doing is that you're using your teeth to dig your grave that's a hard way to do it that's a very hard way to do it start with the word accept the word in his fullness every measure of it and if that is the fullness of God in you then the rain that's falling will produce exactly what's in your garden is just like uh the the the the our floored that was the reason why those things I place precisely there in the scripture when the angel brought Ezekiel the effect of the of the of of that stage of water was just to his angle praise the Lord when the angel took him into another level he fed the water up to his to his knees there was the measurement for that age praise the Lord when the angel took him father he fed the water around his waist and his lions praise the Lord so to everything to everything God set out a measurement a road how he's going to do it when Noah follow the measurement of God when he followed the measurement of God he followed God's instruction how the ACT should be built because he followed that instruction it created an atmosphere praise the Lord now all these why animals of different nature who come on there endure together Happy Lane praise the Lord they could come honor that because it was built on the God's instruction he follows God's measurement praise the Lord are we together Moses did the same he did the same when he instructed the people to build a tabernacle in the wilderness praise the Lord now you see because Moses gave them the instruction that God gave him and the god the precise measurement even though it was a tabernacle they could erect they could bring it down and they can carry it and then and then put it back up you know uh it was not difficult to do because because all the Levi's that were in the Tabernacle all the Levites that were in the Tabernacle beside the the Aaron and his sons that were going into the holy place all of those Levi's had a work to do those three tribes of Levi's there was one that was their job was to take down the other ones their job was to transport and the other Levi's their job was to take care of things arrange things in the Tabernacle what is that that is also measurement it's measurement in the state they all have their work to do they're all everybody in their place the Lord and because that measurement that other was followed every time the Tabernacle was set up they got the blessing the presence of God would come down and worth it praise the Lord do you think about it yes God asked him right here that the temple should be measured the word should be measured that's a word for the people in this age there's a word for the people that are going into that Temple and the worshipers must also be measured praise the Lord the worshipers must also be measured so there is a word that tells us how you know how we dress how we get ourselves together how we get our life together we get our family together how The Church Must Be run the church is never run on on people's opinion right praise the Lord if we'll be able to experience God in a way that he wants us to experience him we must measure up to God's word measure up to God's standard brother William use that yet he said he said God has a program and we must measure up to that program we must measure up to God's program praise the Lord you'll realize that uh uh every every idolatry every other form of worship that man has created throughout the throughout the ages they don't want to worship the almighty God but yet they take things from the holy God worship and strive to the idols that's right amen they don't want to worship the almighty God they don't want to worship the god of holiness praise the Lord but they love his music amen praise the Lord every form of idol worship you see because worship actually came from God he's the object of worship praise the Lord he was the first one that created Bane to worship Him when he made the angels so every form of worship you have every form of worship even the people that are in the Dark World you know they they say a strap reference Jesus said when you pray say Our Father Who Art in Heaven worship him they are reverence him praise the Lord the people in the dark world and and devilish worship they're also as tribe reverence and they are only making so so heavy on your head praise the Lord You Gotta Give it amen you got to give it praise the Lord think about this when you choose to go into the military and to go and save the country when you get there the first thing to do is that they change your identity amen they take you down to the Bobby shop and cut your head they gave they make every one of your look like brothers praise the Lord amen in as much as it looks cool they are sending a message to you as you come through those Gates we tell you how you dress we tell you how you dress the way you were brought up to dress you don't dress like that yeah right it's a simple message they are telling you we will give you the clothes that you were wearing praise the Lord we we will supply the clothes that you would wear we would dress you I mean they caught your head it asks you to look in the mirror how does it look you like it you can say no they tell you give me 50 push-ups praise the Lord amen and you see God standard is the highest tender the highest tender his Tender Is even above the military standard but you see that that just shows how sin has made us slave that until we get the whip to our back we will not do what we know that is right to do until we get a whip to our back we would dress anyhow copy after the word calling ourselves Christian we treat ourselves anyhow we are honor Grace praise the Lord now you see it and that's the reason why it now shows that uh the way that God deals with us he's now having a whip on our back praise the Lord amen he's not having a whip on our back but what he's doing is that he's dealing with our heart and the way that he deals with your heart it reflects on your outside the way God deals with your heart why are you dress decent why you make yourself to look like a gentleman that must be respected it's because God is dealing with your heart if God is not dealing with you how you will feel you will feed after the culture right praise the Lord you want to grow your hair crazy go ahead grow like crazy I'm not going to open a barber shop for you praise the Lord but God has a measurement he has a standard how are we going to get I mean are we we're talking about a time and I mean see see all of those young people they are in their own word it's what they know but with the grace and the measure that is given to them if God can be dealing with them how much about you and myself that are sitting under the Revere word of the hour we are sitting right under the angel the measuring Angel comes down every day as you open the word he want to take us from one level to another but we are so filled with our own ideas God has a program and we must measure up to that program we try to teach our ministers knowledge we ought to teach them the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord it must start with us amen it must start with us you know when Jesus preacher you must be born again he did not preach it to the common people he preach it to the leaders it was nicodema he was a leader are we together we are trying to get a better class of people there's a better class of people or there's no better class of people than the born-again Christian as the holy ghost that make us better it's not the clothes that we wear that make us better or while we think about ourselves is what God is doing in our lives that make us better praise the Lord you see God has all of these all of these measurements all of these measurements and uh okay I know you young people have to meet this afternoon so try and find a place here to close praise the Lord you know I was I was looking at something uh on all this uh marriage novels tape we were playing there was something I wanted to bring up uh and and talk about you know in the way that God made the the the male than the female there is there there are some things that the scripture says that uh look look at First Timothy chapter one first Timothy chapter two first Timothy chapter two First Timothy chapter two let me just let me just use this and drop right in the end then I will leave you First Timothy chapter two foreign myself for service and I was just thinking about you know all of the things that are growing out there and all of some of the negative response you know that people uh are responding to uh uh you know what is happening out there in Kentucky and and I just what was on my heart I was just uh uh I just I just I just said to myself I wish I had a harder platform to be able to just to jump and say what's wrong with people amen what's wrong they don't have to be in our group as long as God is is dealing with them let's appreciate that God is dealing with them let them go through that first step don't bring them serpent seed as long as God is dealing with them and they are down there asking God and you know identifying and young people coming up and saying I've been addicted to pornographic I've been addicted to all of those you know and and and publicly confessing their sin and wanting God to change their life Why Can't We Gather on our knees and say God do something for those young people foreign chapter 2 verse 8. I would therefore thy man pray every word lifting up holy hands with our wrath and doubting now and if you if you look at this if you look at this this is this is very beautiful I hope that the Lord can help me to bring out in a way that I that uh that he did with me on it I will therefore that men pray everywhere now that word man is is is used in the scripture for the human race amen there are places in the scripture where is used for the him for human rights but if you narrow the thought down in the way that God deals with us okay in a way that God's deals with or let's read another scripture then you will be able to appreciate uh First Timothy chapter one no not first Timothy I said First Peter chapter 3. First Peter chapter three you see you you realize that I'm nervous because I want to let you go now but I just want to give you something so you think about before you leave from here first Timothy 3 verse 1 the Bible says likewise hear why be be so be in suggestion to your own husband that if anyone obeyed not the word they also May without the word be warned by the conversation of their wife now you have found that a woman also can be worn by the composition of her husband but the Holy Spirit intentionally place it like this men pray everywhere woman because the way that she's made the way she's made amen we we have been taught by the prophet that God gave us those three sacrificial for Redemption amen there is something that is placed in her life just like we always says you know uh uh I mean uh when when a woman dressed decent I mean uh uh everybody will associate her to be a kind of a holy ghost woman there were no stray that she said holy ghost woman why because she's made that way amen if I dress decent and wear my suit am I just think I'm a banger praise the Lord that's the first thing that might think I'm working at the bank or some kind of a CEO you know that's that's what I would think praise the Lord now so you see God in a way that he made us there is there is also a way that uh uh uh uh a design that he placed in the scripture praise the Lord there's a design in a way that he placed it in the scripture now it's true that men pray every word means the human race every one of us we must pray everywhere lifting up our holy hands but if you narrow it down to the man you will realize that uh in a way that the woman is made in the way she's made science proved that she she multitasks more than the man Amen in a way that she's made God gave her a womb God placed something under her heart amen and because of her design she's she can she can she can pray more than a man can let me let me say it that way because it's not the worst it's the heart the way she's conditioned she can carry things praise the Lord she can carry things so in my mind I'm sitting down there as God is dealing with me and I'm I'm saying that uh uh you know Apostle Paul is worrying more about the men because what their brother Branham says he says he says man it's not the muscle he says it's the whole that you have in your pains from kneading on your knees he says that's what a man is praise the Lord and you just look at the church look at the laodisha church this church is led by women go in the churches you will find out that the women are more than the men and that also has destroyed our society because man has left his place of of leading his home praise the Lord we want to lead our home with our muscles and our money and the place that a man must lead his womb is on his knees let's man prayed everywhere praise the Lord now you you will understand that I have a message where I I mean kind of for setting on on uh Elijah the woman hit her I'll bring that to you and uh and and then and then when you come over to the place of the woman also you will realize because of the way that she's designed amen age she takes her place like we said her virtue is her power yes so what Peter is dealing with here is that uh if a woman can rightly take her place or attitude can change the atmosphere of the home her attitude can change the man that word conversation means her behavior she's designed for that amen she's designed so you see how the scripture is placing these two roles that's the way that God built it that's the way he designed it are we together she's made that way she can carry things on her heart you know like brother Brandon Chase I'm using that you know he says the scripture says my hearts are failing for fear but he says the Bible didn't say women heart he says if you look at the racial men there are more from heart attack than women it all comes back to that it's not that women are has another feeling for fear but the Bible the Bible intentionally sometimes they say those things to grab your mind what the Bible address this like this there's a key in it praise the Lord there's a key in it if you can grab the key you get the blessing you can open the treasure God has a program and we must measure up to death praise the Lord there's a way he want his church to be and we must measure up to it there's a way that he won our home to be This Promise is unto you and to your children and to as many as the Lord Our God shall call and until we measure up until we meet the measuring angel which is the mighty angel which is the Holy Ghost the measuring Angel is the Holy Ghost praise the Lord the temple is measured even even even the new city the gates are measure the walls I measure the city is measured that's what Revelation 21 says so God is a god of measurement praise the Lord he's a god of measurement there's a period of time what he wants to deal with you he wants to ship your life praise the Lord amen he will always be your God if you miss that period of time you are just going to struggle you are just going to struggle praise the Lord I mean there are people word I mean they will never be able to sit under any Ministry they will never be able to sit under any hair shape praise the Lord because either they are too short or they are too long the ministry can never meet them or they know too much or they know too much praise the Lord there's a time there's a time appointed when you look at even appointed time is a measurement because over in the Old Testament it was seven years they don't go over seven years God gave a definite time to be a time a time appointed he gave a definite time for it for it to be a time of restitution there was a definite time that Jubilee time that a person could go free now if you refuse to go free then you are brought to the post offer of the house and you are stamped which means you always belong to this house there was a time praise the Lord and the scripture was said today is the day of visitation the day that God is dealing with your heart don't put it away amen yeah there are times to fix things if you don't get it fixed in that time and that time pass you will not praise the Lord amen I mean even when you when you when you see how God deals with with you sometimes even even as a preacher there's a time where you have a burden because it's the burden is the anointing that makes you to do several things you just don't do it because you want uh you know uh you just wanna a kind of for routine no is the burden when when that anointing leaves you there is nothing you can do there is nothing you can do there is nothing you can do sometimes you have the burden to to be able to help you know a situation or help somebody and you're putting all that time there and it comes you see the very same person you just don't have it because it's not a mental workup is something that God burning you to do so there's a measurement there's a limit to that that's what time is everything in time has measurement the days have 24 hours the months have a time it begins it has a time it ends to every measurement it has a beginning it has an end that's what time brings us that's what time brings us there's a time where God wants you to experience more of him he want to pull you to himself I can show you another another scripture but I would just take me all the time Paul right there in Corinthians he says like this he says uh uh uh uh you know uh what if if a man is not married he having all of this time for the Lord okay praise the Lord that that's a measurement it does not means that uh you know uh you can save God better when you're not married than when you are married no that's not what it means many people think like that but that's not what it means what it means is is more in a place that now you have this period of time where you can be able to season your life where you can be able to get in the things of God because now when you get married you will now be serving God through or with another person praise the Lord you will now be saving god with another person it will not just be you you will be able to bring this place that's why the man must not extend he said he must let his wife know before he keep himself to himself because if you are not single anymore you are too so why you have this time to be single young people put yourself in the face of God build a prayer life that when you get married it will be part of you yeah it will be part of you because if you don't get it done now praise the Lord if you don't get it done now it's not when you you have a home you have to work you have children and everything you you never cultivated that in your life it will be a struggle it will be a struggle so to everything to everything there is a measurement musicians you can come if the lord gave us the grace we'll continue [Applause] foreign together [Music] you hear those things out there in the Pentecostal world you know and the people says oh yeah you know I see why Paul said it's better to serve the Lord single I mean you just miss the whole thing because God's Perfect Image is male and female he wants you to get into that fullness he wants you to experience that [Music] foreign [Music] this morning I believe that the grace of God has been so good to us in this hour I believe that the Lord God has given us the measuring angel [Music] has been with us he has been in our camp he told us what the four square City looks about [Music] is the measuring injure that taught us the name of every messenger in the church age [Music] as a measuring angel that that make us to understand the move of God moving from the the the harshenberg evades and uh he taught us he teach us about dispensation and the change of dispensation he teaches us about the stages of Grace had God would deal with us on a justification and bring us to faith in Christ and then you will deal with us under sanctification and God will deal with us under the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost himself is here to continue with us God has brought us under a message of precision he's very precise honor the discernment that angel we call the names of the people call their addresses he's the measuring angel he never makes them miss the Mark at any time he knows where you are he knows what you are lacking in your life he knows what you are liking he knows the things that are troubling you he knows and whatever you are trying to use to fill the Gap will not when I meet up God's measurement you must come back to the word you must use that that the line of the word the measuring Rock of the word we will not have a good result in this church if we don't can't get back to the word get back
