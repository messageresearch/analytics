[59:14] is true amen it's without error it's
[59:17] without fault or mistake and I I say
[59:19] that a lot because what I want to do

[1:00:29] that we're in an atmosphere of God's
[1:00:32] thinking amen and to know that his
[1:00:34] thoughts have no error have no mistake
[1:00:38] amen there's nothing that can challenge
[1:00:40] and overcome God's thoughts but it will
[1:00:43] come to pass amen what should that do
[1:00:46] for us if we would realize we were in
[1:00:49] that place it should create something
[1:00:52] Hallelujah within us now today by God
[1:00:56] Grace I want to address something amen
[1:00:59] as much as I thank God for him me and
[1:01:01] him are completely
[1:01:03] different see you can sit back on him

[1:01:09] Hallelujah because he's a pastor there's
[1:01:11] certain parts of his ministry where he
[1:01:13] can just tap he can tap into the
[1:01:15] teaching element he can tap into the
[1:01:18] Apostle element he can tap into every
[1:01:20] area of the fivefold as a pastor
[1:01:23] sometimes he can be an evangelist
[1:01:24] Hallelujah so you you can come to church
[1:01:27] and because of his gift Hallelujah he
[1:01:29] can meet you where you at it ain't like

[1:02:51] provider God is here right now
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:02:59] and I don't think some of you are
[1:03:01] catching what's going on but what I want
[1:03:03] to do Hallelujah is make contact that's
[1:03:06] right
[1:03:08] brother now the prophet of God says when
[1:03:11] you
[1:03:12] say you're saying so be it you're saying
[1:03:16] I agree you're saying be it unto me
[1:03:20] according to what you just
[1:03:22] say so when I say that Jesus Christ is
[1:03:26] Lord and you say Amen you are agreeing
[1:03:30] with his
[1:03:32] lordship come on now and the more we say
[1:03:35] amen amen the more God will approach you
[1:03:39] because you're telling God I agree with
[1:03:41] you there's no man that can ever Court a
[1:03:45] woman without her saying yes come on she
[1:03:48] has to agree amen there's no way you can
[1:03:51] get anything from God without a
[1:03:56] so I want you to understand something
[1:03:57] today Church in order for you to get
[1:04:00] anything from God you have to give God
[1:04:02] something to work with Hallelujah and
[1:04:05] you know uh there may have been times
[1:04:07] when you come to church and you just
[1:04:09] kind of sit back and you just kind of
[1:04:11] laid back and you say I wonder what's
[1:04:13] going to happen Hallelujah then you're
[1:04:16] waiting on somebody else but when you
[1:04:18] come here and you say God I got needs
[1:04:22] when you come here this morning you say
[1:04:23] Lord Hallelujah Lord I I'm going to in
[1:04:26] my spirit Hallelujah pull on the gift of
[1:04:29] God so you can respond to me amen when
[1:04:32] was the last time you came to church and
[1:04:35] whatever you was praying about or or
[1:04:37] reading or listening to the preacher
[1:04:39] came in church and started talking to
[1:04:41] you Hallelujah start Tong you know what
[1:04:44] that is that's you getting in contact
[1:04:46] with God that's you making a contact
[1:04:49] with the Lord hallelujah and there's too
[1:04:52] many times we come to church with no
[1:04:55] expectation
[1:04:57] now I want to say this Hallelujah Easter
[1:04:59] was a couple of weeks ago Hallelujah so
[1:05:02] all the religious people should be
[1:05:07] gone that's true the heart and soul
[1:05:10] should be in church today that's right
[1:05:12] the people who really want something
[1:05:14] from God the people who are not worried
[1:05:16] about how much gas cost and and you know
[1:05:19] and and what I got in the way and what I
[1:05:21] got to put on we have to understand that
[1:05:23] we come here to meet God yes this today
[1:05:27] could be your point of contact this
[1:05:29] today could be H the day you came to
[1:05:32] church you made a contact with God
[1:05:35] hallelujah cuz church if you ever make a
[1:05:38] real contact with God you will be
[1:05:41] changed Hallelujah and that's the reason
[1:05:44] church people come to church and they go
[1:05:46] back home do the same thing you know why
[1:05:49] because they had made a contact
[1:05:51] Hallelujah and even right now I'm trying
[1:05:54] not to go the way of rebuking
[1:05:59] Spirits cuz that's just how I'm built
[1:06:02] because if you can't rejoice in the word
[1:06:04] that's because there's something else in
[1:06:05] the way yes Hallelujah and the way I'm
[1:06:08] built I'm built to bark at the Devil
[1:06:11] come
[1:06:11] [Music]
[1:06:12] on Hallelujah I'm built to bark at the
[1:06:16] Devil come on now I'm built to tell the
[1:06:18] devil you got no right hallelujah oh my
[1:06:22] don't bring your religion amongst us we
[1:06:26] want relationship with God hallelujah
[1:06:29] we're sisters and we're brothers and we
[1:06:31] don't have to come before God and say
[1:06:33] Lord I'm your son no as soon as God sees
[1:06:36] us the attributes of who he is begin to
[1:06:39] ooze
[1:06:40] out Hallelujah and the problem is too
[1:06:44] many people don't know who they
[1:06:48] are but church when we think about
[1:06:51] making a contact you know I preached
[1:06:54] years ago and I may even said this here
[1:06:58] but I I preached years ago a message
[1:07:00] collision and
[1:07:02] impact you know uh last

[2:03:25] she saw all her problems being drowned
[2:03:28] in the sea she said all the things that
[2:03:31] Pharaoh did every piece of slavery every
[2:03:34] piece of sadness every piece of doubt
[2:03:37] everything that could hurt her was being
[2:03:39] drowned in the sea and that made her
[2:03:42] worship Hallelujah and that L she led
[2:03:46] the daughters of Zion into worship
[2:03:48] Hallelujah and she took Hallelujah an
[2:03:51] instrument that was created in bondage

[2:08:04] hallelujah let me find it right quick
[2:08:07] the Bible says that uh David was greatly
[2:08:12] distressed see there was a spirit trying
[2:08:14] to get on him to make him
[2:08:17] distressed and you have to be careful
[2:08:19] when you're going through something that
[2:08:20] there are Spirit is trying to get on you
[2:08:22] to react the way that God doesn't want
[2:08:24] you to
[2:08:25] react because God takes you through
[2:08:27] things to make you better H but look it
[2:08:31] say David was very distressed he was
[2:08:33] greatly distressed for the people spake
[2:08:35] of stoning him not the people
[2:08:37] angry all these things is making a
[2:08:40] contact in this moment you got angry
[2:08:42] people you got a king that once felt
[2:08:45] love now he's feeling the distress of
[2:08:48] the people he's feeling that they want
[2:08:50] to kill him hallah this is the same
[2:08:53] David who set everybody free by killing
[2:08:56] Goliath oh my but now there's different
[2:08:59] Spirits trying to make a contact he says
[2:09:00] because the soul of all the people was
[2:09:03] grieved see you see distraction you see
[2:09:06] anger and now you see grief Hallelujah
[2:09:09] all these Spirits are trying to make a
[2:09:11] contact that's right but there's only
[2:09:13] one thing that can stop it Hallelujah
[2:09:15] there's only one thing that can stop it
[2:09:17] Hallelujah the Bible says but David amen
[2:09:21] encouraged himself
[2:09:23] [Music]
[2:09:26] Hallelujah when spirits come that are
[2:09:29] not of the character of God you have to
[2:09:32] encourage
[2:09:33] yourself hallelujah oh my church how did
[2:09:37] David encourage himself David went back
[2:09:39] to the things that God has already done
[2:09:42] right Hallelujah David started to go
[2:09:45] back down memory lane David start to
[2:09:47] remember his testimonies David start to
