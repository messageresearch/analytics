and we are very grateful to the lord for uh his grace and his love and his mercy we know that it's truth that you know the devil can bring a whole city down just because of one elect so it might be because of you you're staying for the lord and but we also want to staying with the families staying with the community staying with our city our country with everything that is going on now and we just want to commit that in the hands of the law let's just uh read a very familiar scripture uh we want to uh take tonight that would just be a verse from praise the lord praise the lord we'll read second chronicles ii chronicles and just like i said a very ii chronicles chapter seven second chronicles chapter seven we read from verse 12 uh this is very familiar to us but uh we want to we just want to take a verse here i will show you there and [Music] ii chronicles chapter 7 we read from verse 12 and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i have heard that prayer and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the locals to devote the land or if i send pestilence among the people if my people if my people almighty god is saying that my people which i call by my name shall humble themselves now we have to know that this is not a promise to the word this is a promise to a people that god has called by his name if my people which i call by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face not only in a prayer meeting tonight but seek the face of the lord and turn from their wicked ways then i will year from heaven and i will forgive their sin and will heal the land now i got attracted to uh this verse tonight or these few verses that i read just because of those few words i will heal their land we need healing and we are not able to to congregate in church tonight because our i will learn our community is hurting so we need healing praise the lord we don't want it to be no worse than what it is and we will just we will just inform you i mean we having uh the parking lot with cars in it of uh of protesters and that are going down the street and the church the lutheran church uh about our side here also the parking lot is filled with university a parking lot filled on a wednesday night like sometimes hours is filled service but the parking lot is filled just because of people that are all crowding out there tonight so the community is here is hurting and that's the reason why we all came congregating church tonight so uh but we're having a promise before us here that if uh people god's people that are called uh by his name if we would just humbled ourselves tonight it would just take you to take it to consideration in seriousness tonight that if god do not intervene and and turn the situation around we could go weeks without church you know if it get any worse you know the the dallas toll across the street here was uh was broken into you know but the lord has been faithful to keep our building and we have now seen any sign of people trying to break into it so we want to thank the law for that also and so let's just take this to heart tonight we having we're having a few prayer burdens that we want to take before the lord but i have a also a quote from brother branham the message humbled that self uh i want to read that also before we just take our uh [Music] the prophet god said and god can only operate as we let him operate as we will yield ourselves tonight as we will put our hearts before the lord god can only operate as we will let him operate you know people want power and really they don't know what power is sunday we spoke a little bit on there when brother brennan was talking about when adam lost his power he lost his friendship with god he lost his relationship with god he lost his fellowship with god brother branham online there that that was the power and that is where power is for the church of the living god we don't have power if we don't have friendship with god we don't have power if we don't have a fellowship or a relationship with god so brother branham says you know people want power and they really and the uh and they don't know what power is see they don't really know what goes with it the way up is down always if you want power see how humble you can get if the people that are called by my name will humble themself if you want power with god to stop the situation that is happening in our community to stop situations that is happening in our lives and around our families and loved ones if we want power with god see how humble we can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself and humble yourself before god and then you have got more power than the man that run all over the building and making a big loud of noise so you think about it tonight here is the community and people driving from other parts of the city tonight and coming into brooklyn center to be able to make their voice to be hurting and uh they want power but jerry said you are at your home and we can just humble ourselves take our thoughts from straight in the way and just put our mind on the lord brother branham says we have so much power in that position tonight than the people that are running down the street our prayer tonight can change the situation more than the violence or the uh their peaceful protests or you know whatever they they are carrying out tonight just our position and that's what we can offer to the community tonight is to call on the name of the lord it's not to go on facebook and make our voice to be heard which of course you have a right to do that if you want to but i think we can make our voice to be head at the throne of god this evening if we would just take the needs take the hurting families before the lord in prayer tonight he says the way up is down if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from all your wallet thinking it's it does not it does not means uh you know uh uh you know uh uh sinful thinking it's just it's just uh getting our mind center on the lord just getting our mind on the lord think on a promise tonight thing on god's promise you know he says uh we will see the the reward of the wicked you know uh they will fall on our right hand and our left hand they will not come night us you know uh the lord is a present help in time of you know trouble if we can just keep our mind on the promise of god tonight he says get all your wallet thinking and humble humble yourself before god and then you have got more power than the man that run all over the building and make a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me in a church that's humble really humble not on our net not arrogance say because we said we are in the message now arrogance said because of the building that we have or anything but really humble and to be humble is to come in obedience to every word of god not arrogance at church just as sweet humble church i will show you a church that has the favor and the power of god in it that's right that's the thing it takes that's what it takes humanity humbling ourselves before god letting god just work through us to heal us letting god just work through us to deliver us allowing god to work through us to preach the word allowing god to work through us to believe the word allowing god to work through us don't have to make a lot of noise but just allowing god to speak through us tonight as we take this knees to the lord in prayer let's just sing this little song i need you lord right now [Music] we need you lord we need you lord we
