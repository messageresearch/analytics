[50:09] will speak for us on Wednesday night and
[50:12] uh
[50:14] uh I think
[50:17] uh so far so good I think that's that's
[50:20] all I had of my mind to to also announce
[50:25] and uh uh I know that uh uh for the
[50:30] short while we we spoke with some of you
[50:32] parents for what we wanted to do uh for
[50:37] uh the young people and
[50:39] ourself and uh in putting the program
[50:43] together we realized that we did not
[50:45] have enough time to do what we were
[50:48] planning to do so uh not to dash your
[50:52] expectation we says uh uh we want to we
[50:55] want to do something better so we hoping
[50:59] to work on it whatever we wanted to do
[51:02] uh uh we will put things together and
[51:05] come up with something better because
[51:08] it's it's going to cost
[51:10] money and and then we don't want you we
[51:13] don't want you to go into your
[51:16] savings so we want to have uh prepare
[51:21] you ahead of time so we can be able to
[51:23] do it that it will not put strain on you
[51:25] it will not put train on us so uh
[51:29] whatever we spoke to you about uh for
[51:32] now is cancer until we can come up with
[51:35] a better plan so uh I thought that I
[51:38] should bring that uh announcement to you
[51:42] publicly so we will not just keep you in
[51:44] the de praise the
[51:47] Lord and uh uh this morning um I was
[51:53] really thinking uh or uh I had
[51:57] lot few things in my mind I wanted to
[51:58] talk about until uh U I woke up this
[52:03] morning and uh uh praying and then I
[52:07] kind of for
[52:12] uh uh the brother Brandon message on the
[52:15] emment just came to my mind and I think
[52:18] maybe it was also because of some of the
[52:21] things I was thinking about we are in uh
[52:24] uh such a time uh I mean uh uh
[52:28] nationalwide the the country is in a
[52:31] period of election and but the word is
[52:34] also on the stage there there are few
[52:37] things that are happening you you with
[52:41] some of you that have uh uh kinded with
[52:44] the news and all that you see that we
[52:46] had a um the Olympics growing up in
[52:50] France and there very uh Blasphemous and
[52:55] disgraceful op of the Olympics where the
[52:59] they had a a setting like uhu uh the
[53:04] communion and and all of that and uh
[53:09] uh and then the word has also just
[53:13] experienced uh what they called
[53:15] politically what they call one of the
[53:17] greatest uh prisoner exchange now you
[53:20] think about it you think about it here
[53:23] said the the nations of the world has
[53:26] gather for an
[53:28] Olympics and whoever were the organizer
[53:32] they taught in their mind they are doing
[53:35] their own set thing in France in their
[53:37] mind they taught to make this display
[53:41] and you know and the display that they
[53:44] make will look like something that will
[53:47] will
[53:48] resemble uh uh Jesus and his disciples
[53:51] having the Lord
[53:53] supper praise the Lord with bun sh uh uh
[53:59] uh unsane characters you know all sorts
[54:02] of uh then after that think about it now
[54:07] after
[54:09] that y said this
[54:13] week the political world is also
[54:16] experiencing what they called the
[54:18] greatest prisoner
[54:21] exchange praise the
[54:23] Lord and when you see out of there that
[54:27] is
[54:29] happening you ask yourself what is going
[54:32] on why what is going on you sit back you
[54:35] say man what is going on are we paying
[54:38] attention to what is going on thinking
[54:41] about all of that uh during the
[54:45] week I was thinking about uh I wanted to
[54:49] speak on Revelation chapter 4 uh on the
[54:51] open door but then uh uh I had this you
[54:56] know aut talk that I'm not I'm not gone
[54:59] through yet we were talking about the
[55:02] cup Bearer and and we show how as as
[55:06] Believers we are God's cup Bearer you
[55:10] know and uh uh he have that little place
[55:14] in our heart that uh you know uh as as
[55:18] his dwelling place where the Holy Ghost
[55:20] comes and and it makes us a cup Bearer
[55:23] to to be able to quench the test of this
[55:26] world
[55:27] word but I also share with you that I
[55:30] was looking at another cup bar in
[55:32] Revelation chapter 17 that woman that
[55:35] had uh uh uh made the kings of the earth
[55:38] to be drunk with the wine of her
[55:42] fornication praise the Lord so see what
[55:45] is on my mind see maybe you could help
[55:47] me but just look at what is on my mind
[55:50] just
[55:51] before Barabas will be exchanged for
[55:55] Jesus
[55:56] Jesus has just come
[56:01] from having the Lord's
[56:05] supper and he took the cup and said take
[56:09] this cup take the bread this represent
[56:13] my
[56:14] body praise the Lord this represent my
[56:17] body eat and uh uh do this in
[56:22] remembrance of me praise the Lord and He
[56:26] said they take this
[56:27] cup this is the blood of the New
[56:31] Covenant take and drink as of as you
[56:35] drink this in remembrance of
[56:39] me and uh and that he told the church to
[56:44] do in remembrance of him praise the
[56:49] Lord and that has been something that
[56:54] was very very s ific to the LA church it
[56:58] was so much significant important to
[57:02] them that every time they
[57:05] gather every evening they gather the
[57:09] Bible says they went from house to house
[57:12] breaking
[57:13] bread that was meaning the communion so
[57:17] every time they gathered they had a
[57:19] communion service uh uh and then as time
[57:23] went went on uh the church couldn't
[57:27] gather because of persecution so the
[57:29] disciples started to choose where to
[57:32] meet and when to meet to have communion
[57:36] when the church
[57:38] organized then the Roman uh uh uh Church
[57:43] in h lead starts to give the church an
[57:46] instruction then communion starts to
[57:49] become uh a first Sunday think praise
[57:53] the Lord and uh and you know and first
[57:57] Sunday even though the with with the
[58:01] Catholic system and and what she
[58:03] introduced to the word you know uh she
[58:06] tried to make uh uh in her way of
[58:11] bringing uh uh a deceitful way of
[58:15] bringing importance to the communion she
[58:18] makes that as uh uh uh you know the
[58:23] bread representing the body of the Lord
[58:25] and and uh and which of course the
[58:28] believe the priest has the power to
[58:30] change that way for bread to the literal
[58:32] body of Jesus Christ and uh and and also
[58:37] the wine to the literal blood of Jesus
[58:40] but what happened is there because of
[58:43] the dominance because of the influence
[58:46] of the Roman Church over the
[58:50] churches many uh even with the ones
[58:54] after the Reformation l came out and in
[58:57] wesling and even the Pentecost we we
[59:01] still see an effect of the Catholic
[59:05] system on the church when it comes to
[59:08] communion praise the Lord
[59:11] amen because you will realize that the
[59:16] communion both Bread and Wine represent
[59:20] the
[59:20] word praise the
[59:22] Lord the bread is uh the body of Jesus
[59:26] Jesus the body is the word praise the
[59:29] Lord amen the blood is I mean the wine
[59:33] represent the blood is the
[59:36] life the life is in the
[59:40] blood so the the the the the communion
[59:44] bread and wine is not above this word
[59:48] it's just a
[59:50] symbol praise the Lord but the church
[59:54] because of the effect of of
[59:56] calm they are
[59:59] afraid of the Bread and
[1:00:03] Wine and yet they disregard the word of
[1:00:08] God they can disrespect the word in
[1:00:11] their home they can disrespect the word
[1:00:13] in their way of dressing and their way
[1:00:16] of living but when it come oh
[1:00:20] no when it comes to what is a symbol
[1:00:27] praise the Lord amen when it comes to
[1:00:29] what is a symbol they take the most
[1:00:31] holiest
[1:00:34] reverence it's just a
[1:00:39] symbol it's just a
[1:00:45] symbol praise the
[1:00:50] lord it's just a symbol it's just like
[1:00:54] the water you go down to be baptized is
[1:00:56] a
[1:00:57] symbol now the Holy Ghost do the the
[1:01:01] Regeneration the cleansing and and all
[1:01:03] of that now so you see
[1:01:07] that and I mean it's it's it's church
[1:01:10] people it affect people I mean the
[1:01:12] effect of catholism on church people
[1:01:14] even on message
[1:01:19] people and uh
[1:01:23] uh kind losing my TR of taught here but
[1:01:28] yeah so you see all of that you see all
[1:01:31] of
[1:01:32] that
[1:01:35] until
[1:01:41] sometimes that actually supposed to be a
[1:01:44] blessing and is a blessing not just
[1:01:47] supposed but it's a blessing to the
[1:01:50] church praise the Lord whenever we come
[1:01:54] together
[1:01:56] to have a
[1:01:57] communion it's a blessing it has its uh
[1:02:01] uh uh you know spiritual benefit for a
[1:02:05] local church it has a spiritual benefit
[1:02:08] even for an individual as a Believer
[1:02:12] praise the Lord I might speak more on
[1:02:14] that uh uh uh coming September year
[1:02:18] maybe on uh uh first Sunday in September
[1:02:21] we might have a communion service I
[1:02:23] might talk a little bit on that but I'm
[1:02:27] I'm I'm coming to this place just for us
[1:02:30] to be able to to grab something you see
[1:02:34] something uh by the grace of God
[1:02:37] uh uh I heard brother brandham
[1:02:41] saying uh and actually he was saying
[1:02:45] this um in the prayer line he was saying
[1:02:48] this under discernment see see this just
[1:02:51] let let's read this
[1:02:53] together we have not read the word here
[1:02:56] I know uh so just just bear with me I'm
[1:02:58] trying to find my
[1:03:01] footing praise the Lord amen in the
[1:03:05] message do you do you now
[1:03:11] believe he said
[1:03:13] this he
[1:03:15] said in Indiana
[1:03:24] Indianapolis there was a boy dying with
[1:03:28] polio in an iron
[1:03:31] long and uh I went into the upper room
[1:03:35] of the man's house and prayed and the
[1:03:38] Lord came down and gave me a vision and
[1:03:42] said what was the matter with the
[1:03:46] boy to take him the
[1:03:50] communion because one
[1:03:54] time he did be
[1:03:56] refused to take the communion on account
[1:03:59] of his
[1:04:03] age
[1:04:05] so what was happening to this
[1:04:09] child that was going to ca his
[1:04:13] life was
[1:04:16] because a church
[1:04:21] system
[1:04:23] refused for the little boy to take
[1:04:26] communion because of his
[1:04:29] age look we cannot preach this message
[1:04:33] you are not the
[1:04:36] messenger we are not the
[1:04:38] messenger we can't preach this message
[1:04:41] more than the
[1:04:42] messenger we can do the best we can in
[1:04:46] the lot that is given to
[1:04:50] us praise the
[1:04:52] Lord so brother B is explaining to us
[1:04:56] here this child had a had an illness he
[1:05:01] was dying with polio and we went up to
[1:05:04] pray and then the Lord came down and
[1:05:06] revealed to him that this child was is
[1:05:09] is is at the point of death because
[1:05:13] something affected this
[1:05:16] child something affected his young
[1:05:22] mind maybe he was just refused and
[1:05:25] nobody took the time to explain to
[1:05:29] him oh ga from here you are just small
[1:05:32] you are not qualified to take the
[1:05:35] communion without telling him
[1:05:38] why without explaining to him
[1:05:45] why you don't
[1:05:48] correct by shaming
[1:05:53] anybody the way shame affect people in
[1:05:57] their Spirit yes when you just throw
[1:06:01] them off especially little
[1:06:10] ones let's let's continue to
[1:06:18] read the Lord came down and gave me the
[1:06:20] vision and said what's the matter with a
[1:06:23] boy to take to take him the communion
[1:06:26] because one time he did been refus to
[1:06:30] take communion on account of his
[1:06:33] age and they had no communion at this
[1:06:37] house so I went to Brother hisra and he
[1:06:43] fished the communion I take it and give
[1:06:46] it to the boy in the Ison and pronounce
[1:06:51] the blessing of God on
[1:06:54] him and the boys living in Indianapolis
[1:06:58] today we thank the good Lord for his
[1:07:03] Mercy for
[1:07:05] them
[1:07:07] amen praise the
[1:07:09] Lord you
[1:07:12] see it's true thank God we're not in
[1:07:15] denomination
[1:07:16] amen but yet God has to get
[1:07:19] denominationalism from out of
[1:07:21] Us Praise the Lord because many of us we
[1:07:24] are dragging a lot of denominationalism
[1:07:27] idea with
[1:07:29] us glory be to God one of the common one
[1:07:33] that we do we don't believe in infant
[1:07:36] baptism there is no scripture in the
[1:07:40] Bible but there is one thing I always
[1:07:42] talk to little little kids when uh
[1:07:45] whenever you know they talk to me about
[1:07:48] baptism the Bible says Peter said that
[1:07:52] baptism shows a good conscience
[1:07:56] that's what the Apostle Peter said a
[1:07:58] good conscience towards
[1:08:01] God praise the
[1:08:03] Lord and if we think that our children
[1:08:07] have to be 15 16 years old before they
[1:08:10] have good conscious I will tell you that
[1:08:12] some of the little
[1:08:14] ones have better good conscience towards
[1:08:18] God but you see what are we doing we are
[1:08:22] playing the card of denominationalism
[1:08:25] we are playing catholism
[1:08:30] because catholism will only allow you to
[1:08:33] send your children to
[1:08:36] catechism when they were over 12 years
[1:08:39] old praise the
[1:08:42] Lord that even as a parent we
[1:08:46] cannot appreciate our children good
[1:08:49] conscious towards God it's our
[1:08:53] responsibility to be able to guide them
[1:08:55] in that
[1:08:58] path and when the child is a young child
[1:09:01] and they are Desiring to do it you don't
[1:09:04] have a right to tell them you are not at
[1:09:06] the age to be baptized you don't have
[1:09:08] the
[1:09:13] right I will advise you baptize them and
[1:09:17] then when they grow up and want to
[1:09:19] rededicate themselves then let them do
[1:09:21] it
[1:09:27] but there's a bundle of
[1:09:30] denominationalism stay in our
[1:09:33] spirit praise the
[1:09:35] Lord and brother Bram says he went down
[1:09:38] and went down and looked to this
[1:09:40] preacher house and see if you would get
[1:09:41] a communion to bring down and give to
[1:09:44] This Little
[1:09:47] Child because maybe that thing might
[1:09:50] have hurt that child so much until that
[1:09:54] little
[1:09:56] boy was just feeling so bad in
[1:10:00] him so
[1:10:03] bad that he would get
[1:10:06] sick to the point of
[1:10:15] Death and All saying says and a hint to
[1:10:20] a wise is sufficient let's stand on our
[1:10:23] feet praise the Lord
[1:10:28] if you want to find out what it means
[1:10:30] let's talk about it
[1:10:32] later you love the Lord you ready for
[1:10:35] the word of God praise the Lord the Lord
[1:10:38] bless you let's take our Bibles uh and
[1:10:40] turn to Revelation chapter
[1:10:44] 17 you know so out of that I was I was I
[1:10:47] was just you know listening to a tip and

[1:10:52] actually in the prayer line when he when
[1:10:54] he uh when he made this
[1:10:56] statement it just caught my mind and and
[1:11:00] I I I cop copied the quotes and and I
[1:11:02] just uh I put it down and and then uh to
[1:11:07] see everything that's been playing you

[1:11:13] when I just saw that France something I
[1:11:16] just I say oh my God I it's it's it's a
[1:11:19] good sign what that shows is a sign of
[1:11:24] how
[1:11:26] load and poor the church has
[1:11:29] become because I'm telling you if they
[1:11:32] will have ever try to to imitate
[1:11:36] anything concerning the Quran or some
[1:11:39] other religion France who have been on
[1:11:44] fire France will have been on fire yes
[1:11:49] they will have been bumping everywhere
[1:11:50] and throwing gas
[1:11:52] everywhere but the church is always
[1:11:54] trying
[1:11:58] on and we get so
[1:12:01] afraid we got to keep our mouth
[1:12:04] shut and then we turn there to be you

[1:12:34] indignation you love the Lord Revelation
[1:12:38] chapter 17 let's read together sorry
[1:12:41] I've taken a little bit of your time
[1:12:43] here to to just make some of those
[1:12:46] comments but we we're going right into
[1:12:48] Revelation chapter 17 we read from verse
[1:12:50] one and there came one of the Seven
[1:12:53] Angels which had the seven VES and talk
[1:12:56] with me saying saying unto me come
[1:12:59] hither I will show unto thee the
[1:13:01] Judgment of the great hold they seated
[1:13:05] upon many Waters with whom the kings of
[1:13:08] the Earth have committed fornication and
[1:13:11] the inhabitants of the Earth have been
[1:13:15] drunk with the wine of her
[1:13:19] fornication man if you can't see this if
[1:13:22] you can't see the drunkenness that the
[1:13:24] word is going on I mean the drunkenness
[1:13:26] that is in the word and how all the
[1:13:29] kings the leaders of the of the word are
[1:13:32] under the
[1:13:33] influence of this drunkenness this is
[1:13:35] more spiritual
[1:13:37] drunkenness because that's one of the
[1:13:39] drunkenness that is hard to be delivered
[1:13:41] from the physical
[1:13:43] drunkenness praise the
[1:13:46] Lord so he carried me away in the spirit
[1:13:49] Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman
[1:13:52] sit upon the skaret CAU a beast for four
[1:13:55] four of names of blasphemic having seven
[1:13:58] head and 10 HS we know that's the Roman
[1:14:01] Church that's a description of the
[1:14:03] Vatican and the woman was arrayed in
[1:14:06] purple and scarlet color and dark with
[1:14:08] gold and precious stones and pray having
[1:14:11] a golden cup this is another cup
[1:14:15] Bearer praise the Lord this is another
[1:14:18] cup Bearer so the word has two cup barar
[1:14:22] and one cup bar is the Bride of Jesus
[1:14:24] Christ
[1:14:25] that is bearing the wine of the New
[1:14:28] Covenant she's bearing that wine in her
[1:14:31] life in the form of the Holy Ghost and
[1:14:33] here is another woman that is also
[1:14:36] having a wine in the golden cup and with
[1:14:39] this wine she has affected all the kings
[1:14:43] of the Earth the Lord bless you you may
[1:14:45] have your seat we continue to
[1:14:51] read verse four then the woman was
[1:14:53] arrayed in purple and scarlet color dark
[1:14:56] with gold and precious stones and bir
[1:14:59] having a golden cup in in her hand full
[1:15:02] with abomination and filthiness of her
[1:15:06] fornication and upon her head was
[1:15:09] written a
[1:15:10] name upon her
[1:15:13] forehead was the name written mysty
[1:15:15] Babylon the great the mother of Hots and
[1:15:20] the abomination of the earth praise the
[1:15:22] Lord so she's the mother and and all her
[1:15:25] daughters are also in spiritual
[1:15:32] prostitution verse six and I saw the
[1:15:34] woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:15:39] Saints and with the blood of the MERS of
[1:15:43] Jesus and when I saw her I wonder with
[1:15:48] great admiration now John now you have
[1:15:52] to realize that I mean he he was part of
[1:15:55] the ear church and he seen this woman
[1:15:59] he's seing this system drunk with the
[1:16:02] blood of the Saints drunk with the blood
[1:16:06] of the disciples that were
[1:16:09] killed and he says a Marvel with great
[1:16:12] admiration who is this woman because
[1:16:15] remember everything that he's seen he's
[1:16:17] seen it in the symbol
[1:16:19] form praise the
[1:16:23] Lord are we together
[1:16:26] that's verse 6 chapter 18 verse three
[1:16:30] let's just read verse three in chapter
[1:16:32] 18 that's a continuation but uh it will
[1:16:35] take us a whole lot of time to to uh
[1:16:39] verse three the Bible says and uh for
[1:16:41] all nations have drunk the wine of the
[1:16:45] wrath of a fornication and the kings of
[1:16:48] the Earth have committed fornication
[1:16:51] with her and the merchants of the Earth
[1:16:54] are watch reach through the abundance of
[1:16:58] her
[1:16:59] delicacy praise the Lord so whether is
[1:17:02] the leaders whether it's the wealthy men
[1:17:04] of the word they all bow down to the to
[1:17:07] to the Roman system they all kiss the
[1:17:10] toes of the of the
[1:17:13] Pope I just say it plainly so I'll be
[1:17:16] able to preach my message
[1:17:21] amen they all case the toes of the Pope
[1:17:30] now I I I I I titled this uh because of
[1:17:34] uh of the lack of
[1:17:37] U trying to come up with a bit good
[1:17:40] title i title is spiritual
[1:17:45] drunkenness when you look at the way the
[1:17:47] word politics is going you look at the
[1:17:51] entire
[1:17:52] word uh you look look
[1:17:56] at
[1:17:57] um Africa with all of its
[1:18:01] wealth and
[1:18:03] how the politics of the rulers never has
[1:18:07] benefit the people and you keep asking
[1:18:10] when will it be praise the
[1:18:14] Lord you think about this you think
[1:18:16] about men rising of going to
[1:18:20] school and they go to the best
[1:18:23] university and they learn you know when
[1:18:26] when they are coming up and they are
[1:18:27] struggling instead their mind is to make
[1:18:30] a
[1:18:31] change and they you know telling thems I
[1:18:35] I have to do something and but then when
[1:18:37] they get up to that
[1:18:40] place and they go back into the
[1:18:43] system politics every word is the same
[1:18:48] why because it's controlled by the
[1:18:51] devil praise the Lord the reason why it
[1:18:55] might it it turn to looks like maybe
[1:18:57] it's a little bit different in in in
[1:18:59] America is because the society year was
[1:19:02] buil on
[1:19:04] earnestly there's a little bit of a
[1:19:06] there praise the
[1:19:09] Lord but the
[1:19:12] system the control the influence behind
[1:19:15] the system is of the
[1:19:19] devil are we
[1:19:22] together praise the Lord
[1:19:26] so you find those men you know the the
[1:19:28] the steud uh they are very uh get uh
[1:19:33] good intentions you know great Ambitions
[1:19:37] but as soon as they get in the system
[1:19:39] the drink of the wine they get drunk all
[1:19:43] the thing they were thinking to
[1:19:46] change has just gone because when a man
[1:19:50] is when a man is drunk his brain is
[1:19:53] block
[1:19:55] the brain does not think in the normal
[1:19:58] way that's the reason why he keeps
[1:20:00] saying the same thing over and over and
[1:20:03] he said things that don't make
[1:20:05] sense so if you look at the word with
[1:20:09] all of the the great
[1:20:13] inventions that are in the word with the
[1:20:16] place word you know uh uh uh signs have
[1:20:20] arrived and and everything that is
[1:20:22] happening you will think that
[1:20:25] we must not be talking about poverty we
[1:20:28] must not be talking about you know war
[1:20:31] and all of that but why we still have
[1:20:33] these things because they are all drunk
[1:20:36] with the wine of her
[1:20:40] fornication I pray that the Lord will
[1:20:42] give us Grace this
[1:20:43] morning amen I want to I want to speak
[1:20:47] to you more than than just being in
[1:20:50] politics amen
[1:20:55] but I just say that to be able to give
[1:20:58] us a picture you know uh that certain
[1:21:01] things will come real to our mind like
[1:21:04] we have always say uh uh the future for
[1:21:08] the church is the
[1:21:10] rapture praise the Lord is the rapture
[1:21:14] and we are looking forward to that we
[1:21:17] pray that the Lord will be able to uh
[1:21:21] brother preach the message uh the emment
[1:21:24] like I said I woke up this morning and
[1:21:26] and I was lying on the bed praying and
[1:21:29] that that was that was what came to my
[1:21:31] mind so uh uh early this morning that's
[1:21:34] what I was kind of meditating on uh he
[1:21:37] says he said this I I took this and
[1:21:40] added to my notes this morning he
[1:21:44] says I'm ass sure and will show that The
[1:21:48] Same Spirit is on the people
[1:21:52] today that brought the first
[1:21:56] crucification praise the Lord amen so
[1:22:00] just like just like the example that I
[1:22:02] gave
[1:22:05] Parish the the the
[1:22:07] stage uh a demonic communion scene let
[1:22:10] me call it that way praise the Lord and
[1:22:14] then right after
[1:22:16] that russer in the wor got into the
[1:22:21] biggest prison or swap
[1:22:27] if you remind
[1:22:28] yourself of uh of uh
[1:22:34] uh biblical scene you will realize that
[1:22:38] uh it it puts us right at the
[1:22:40] crucification once
[1:22:43] again praise the
[1:22:47] Lord but this time is the word the word
[1:22:50] of God that is going to be crucified
[1:22:56] amen is the word is truth that is going
[1:22:59] to be
[1:23:03] crucified and I just pray that God will
[1:23:07] will help us because what each and every
[1:23:09] one of us need is is an awaken amen
[1:23:14] something that will
[1:23:19] make the time that we are living in so
[1:23:21] real to us something that that will
[1:23:25] create a desire a thirst in our heart to
[1:23:29] long to get closer to God and straighten
[1:23:32] up our walk with God he says it's the
[1:23:35] same The Same Spirit is on the people
[1:23:38] that brought the crucification doing the
[1:23:40] same thing I must do that he says if I'm
[1:23:43] going
[1:23:46] uh if it's going to be a crucification
[1:23:49] he says that they have
[1:23:52] crucified I must show the people
[1:23:55] that the same attitude in the people
[1:23:58] today is doing the same thing
[1:24:00] spiritually that they did physically
[1:24:03] then they crucify physically Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ the son of God that's the reason
[1:24:10] I I indc this generation of of guilty of
[1:24:14] crucifying
[1:24:16] blaspheming that's exactly what took
[1:24:18] place in France that was blaspheming
[1:24:20] like I
[1:24:21] said if do have ever tried with uh uh uh
[1:24:26] because you get a bunch of uh Arabs and
[1:24:28] Muslims in in France they have put that
[1:24:30] City on
[1:24:38] fire now let's let's get to our message
[1:24:41] it looks like that is getting getting it
[1:24:43] looks like it's getting to me too much
[1:24:45] to what I'm supposed to be
[1:24:47] preaching praise the Lord but I want to
[1:24:51] bring you down uh uh I want to bring you
[1:24:54] a a historical path I want to bring you
[1:24:57] down a historical path scripturally so
[1:25:00] you can be able to to follow something
[1:25:04] year and uh uh many years back this is
[1:25:09] one of the thing that uh uh I we read
[1:25:13] this many of you know uh know the some
[1:25:17] of the story of that but this is one of
[1:25:19] the thing you know uh uh uh a prediction
[1:25:23] that brother Brandon made
[1:25:25] back then concerning 1977 now I want you
[1:25:28] to pay attention now I want you to pay
[1:25:30] attention because there's a lot of
[1:25:32] controversy around this but there there
[1:25:35] are things that I want you to watch that
[1:25:38] I want to I want to focus on this
[1:25:43] morning praise the
[1:25:45] Lord now uh
[1:25:48] uh I think uh uh
[1:25:53] uh s
[1:25:54] sister Naomi live portion of this 1977
[1:25:58] pH in the message so uh but we can be we
[1:26:02] can be very
[1:26:04] grateful you know we can be very
[1:26:07] grateful and why I say we can be very
[1:26:09] grateful because there is more
[1:26:11] understanding that has come to the word
[1:26:13] than what they had in those days praise
[1:26:16] the Lord there are many people that
[1:26:18] takes the word for its uh they they
[1:26:22] don't see the you know uh the the
[1:26:25] spiritual application they don't they
[1:26:28] don't grab the the you know the the
[1:26:31] symbols that are in the word the types
[1:26:33] but I I I hope that I will be able to
[1:26:36] we'll be able to find something that
[1:26:37] will grab your attention because I want
[1:26:39] to bring you to a place uh this uh this
[1:26:42] morning so let me read this an
[1:26:44] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:26:46] based on these seven Visions that's the
[1:26:49] seven uh last Vision that brother Bram
[1:26:51] had not his last Vision but it was uh uh
[1:26:55] it's called the last Vision because it
[1:26:57] it it relates to uh uh uh you know the
[1:27:02] end time let me say it that way based on
[1:27:04] these seven Vision along with a rapid
[1:27:08] change which have swept the word in the
[1:27:13] last 50 years I predict I do not
[1:27:16] prophesy that these Visions will have
[1:27:21] all
[1:27:24] we have all come to pass by
[1:27:27] 1977 and though many may feel that this
[1:27:30] is an uh irresponsible statement in view
[1:27:35] of the fact that Jesus said that no man
[1:27:38] know the day nor the hour I still
[1:27:41] maintain this prediction after 30 years
[1:27:44] because Jesus Jesus did now say no man
[1:27:49] could know the year month or week in
[1:27:51] which uh his coming was
[1:27:54] was to be
[1:27:57] completed now also wash that word also
[1:27:59] was to be completed that's not what I'm
[1:28:01] dwelling on but just follow me a little
[1:28:03] bit so I repeat I sincerely believe and
[1:28:07] maintain as a private student of the
[1:28:10] word along with divine
[1:28:14] inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate
[1:28:19] the word system and AER in the
[1:28:22] Millennium okay now so what I want you
[1:28:25] to pay attention to P the code back up
[1:28:28] what I want you to pay attention to is
[1:28:32] the word
[1:28:33] system okay I want you to pay attention
[1:28:36] to that the word system
[1:28:42] because are we together let me read
[1:28:46] something also to you also from uh the
[1:28:48] same church age book this will be from
[1:28:51] the Philadelphia Church age so just keep
[1:28:53] that in your mind the word
[1:28:57] system from the Philadelphia Church
[1:29:01] age it read here I want you to see
[1:29:04] something here God work in
[1:29:08] threes doesn't he it was
[1:29:13] in it was in the third or the the
[1:29:17] pagamas church age the pagamas age that
[1:29:20] the
[1:29:21] church was married to the state
[1:29:25] the be of the nians has become the
[1:29:29] doctrine of the
[1:29:31] nian that age was the open door for the
[1:29:37] false Vine listen to this now
[1:29:41] once once it was backed up by the power
[1:29:46] of the state it became actually a word
[1:29:52] system now so so if you take the word
[1:29:56] system here which of course what he's
[1:29:58] referring to the church that was back up
[1:30:02] with the
[1:30:03] state amen so as long as church and
[1:30:07] state
[1:30:09] emerge the church becomes what the word
[1:30:14] system are you seeing what I'm going
[1:30:16] with this praise the praise the Lord now
[1:30:20] so under the prediction he spoke about
[1:30:23] the termination of the word
[1:30:31] system are are we
[1:30:35] together praise the Lord are you seeing
[1:30:37] where I'm going with
[1:30:42] this the prediction was there will be
[1:30:45] the the the the the by
[1:30:48] 1977 the the the word system will be
[1:30:52] terminated and the uh the the Millennium
[1:30:55] will be
[1:30:56] issuing is that not what we read praise
[1:30:59] the Lord you read that now but here said
[1:31:03] he's also making us to know that when it
[1:31:06] gets to the place where church and state
[1:31:10] that the church will be backed up with
[1:31:13] the power of the state the church
[1:31:16] immediately becomes
[1:31:18] what it becomes the worst
[1:31:21] system so the worst system
[1:31:24] at that time it was thought of as being
[1:31:28] the
[1:31:32] cosmos so everybody oh yeah you know
[1:31:34] that the prediction fail the war didn't
[1:31:36] end the world didn't blow off and and
[1:31:38] all of that but but if you go back I I
[1:31:43] just I just take one of this because
[1:31:44] that's not what I want that's not what
[1:31:46] I'm preaching this morning I'm just
[1:31:48] building to get to where I want to
[1:31:50] preach but you go back and just just
[1:31:52] take word system through your search and
[1:31:55] see over and over he repeats how the
[1:32:02] church has
[1:32:03] become the word
[1:32:06] system why because the church is emerged
[1:32:10] into the word
[1:32:14] politics so it has become the word
[1:32:16] system now let let this is what I want
[1:32:18] to bring you
[1:32:20] to are we together
[1:32:27] the word falling apart again listen to
[1:32:29] this now brother bwood talks about a
[1:32:32] good friend of his called David dupes
[1:32:35] you might have read about that okay this
[1:32:39] guy was a was a preacher was a
[1:32:41] Pentecostal
[1:32:42] preacher back there in the 1950s in from
[1:32:45] South Africa so when he heard when
[1:32:48] brother Brandon went to South Africa and
[1:32:50] had that great campaign of healing uh
[1:32:54] all of these all of these guys came on
[1:32:55] board you know they were all working
[1:32:57] together but I want to read something to
[1:33:00] you here and you can even go online and
[1:33:03] search it yourself there's a book that
[1:33:05] is written called Mr Pentecost if you
[1:33:08] can get a hold of it you you should read
[1:33:10] it now David Deus was called Mr
[1:33:15] Pentecost I'm I'm I'm sure too much
[1:33:18] ahead of myself here but let's let's
[1:33:20] read this word falling apart you and you
[1:33:22] Protestants you you are wanting some big
[1:33:25] organization to lead you over
[1:33:27] run uh run over to you to rule over you
[1:33:31] the World Council of churches how can
[1:33:33] David de pleas is my friend and on this
[1:33:37] ecumenical council that he's talking
[1:33:40] about and bringing these Pentecostal
[1:33:43] people to death now so David depy was
[1:33:46] the man that was called Mr
[1:33:49] Pentecost and and and David Dy
[1:33:53] what he started doing those years
[1:33:57] was he to he had this burden to him his
[1:34:01] burden was there Jesus said father make
[1:34:04] us
[1:34:05] one amen so he felt like he could carry
[1:34:09] the Pentecostal experience to all the
[1:34:12] nominal churches and he was believing
[1:34:15] that he could carry because if you don't
[1:34:18] understand this you will not know how
[1:34:20] the present day ktic church is was born
[1:34:24] born that's a mix of catholism and
[1:34:29] Pentecostal because davidy in
[1:34:33] 1970 I have a picture down there if if
[1:34:36] if those young people can put my picture
[1:34:38] of
[1:34:40] 197 he went with group of of uh of uh of
[1:34:45] Pentecostal
[1:34:46] preachers to the
[1:34:49] Vatican praise the Lord to represent the
[1:34:53] the the the the the Catholic Church okay
[1:34:57] yes yes the picture of there this is a
[1:34:58] very old
[1:35:00] picture and uh that's David Dey right
[1:35:03] there and that was the president uh Pope
[1:35:07] uh uh John okay that's that's okay now
[1:35:12] so he went over to uh to to the
[1:35:18] Vatican and uh uh uh to to bring this un
[1:35:25] of uh the of the
[1:35:28] church the Protestants and uh and the
[1:35:32] Catholic
[1:35:34] together and he felt like it was his
[1:35:36] mission praise the
[1:35:40] Lord now I could read read more than
[1:35:43] more here to you but brother Bram here
[1:35:45] is saying this my friend David so wish
[1:35:47] me at this time he was even talking
[1:35:50] about it people knew man because uh uh
[1:35:53] uh you know uh Brother David he was he
[1:35:55] was open about what he was doing you
[1:35:58] know he felt like he would and that was
[1:36:00] the reason why that name Mr Pentecost
[1:36:02] was actually given to him by the
[1:36:04] Catholic
[1:36:06] church it was it was more like the Pope
[1:36:09] says it was more like the pope saying
[1:36:11] thank you for bringing my children back
[1:36:16] home praise the
[1:36:19] Lord amen now so you see honor the World
[1:36:23] Council of
[1:36:25] churches uh uh you know all of all of
[1:36:29] these all of these churches you know uh
[1:36:32] uh can run with all of their independent
[1:36:34] wings and you know and why the thing
[1:36:36] makes them different from the Catholic
[1:36:38] church or that but the council don't see
[1:36:41] it like
[1:36:42] that amen the council don't see it it's
[1:36:47] just like just like we talking about in
[1:36:49] the time of the
[1:36:51] crucification there were there were
[1:36:53] different different groups there were
[1:36:54] the Pharisees that believe in the in the
[1:36:56] Resurrection The Sadducees that did not
[1:36:59] believe in the Resurrection the the the
[1:37:02] the Zs and the the herodians and and all
[1:37:04] of these different
[1:37:06] group but for that word to be
[1:37:10] crucified they all had to
[1:37:14] agree in the sah hindrance
[1:37:16] Council the sedran council was made of
[1:37:20] all of these group they put their
[1:37:21] differences away and they had to
[1:37:27] agree that this man Jesus must be
[1:37:32] care praise the
[1:37:34] Lord are we
[1:37:37] together now so uh uh I'm bringing all
[1:37:40] of this to you just to be able to bring
[1:37:43] you a background here because uh uh as
[1:37:46] we go and look into into this Revelation
[1:37:50] uh uh chapter 17 and 18 you get a
[1:37:53] picture of when the scripture says the
[1:37:55] entire word is drunk under the wine of a
[1:38:00] fornication the entire word is under her
[1:38:02] influence even the the the the the the
[1:38:06] kings of the Earth the merchants of the
[1:38:08] earth they are all
[1:38:11] under her
[1:38:13] influence praise the Lord amen and lot
[1:38:17] of these things are are F out through
[1:38:20] the media
[1:38:25] lot of these things are all out there
[1:38:27] you know uh uh you know and and
[1:38:29] everybody saying the same thing and
[1:38:31] everybody doing the same thing and you
[1:38:33] know uh the the church is being put
[1:38:35] pressure on you know to be able to
[1:38:37] embrace the present word word system you
[1:38:41] know uh I mean we must not talk about uh
[1:38:43] you know this person not being right to
[1:38:46] to become a preacher that this person
[1:38:48] does not have no right you know
[1:38:49] everything must be
[1:38:51] inclusive we must have an an inclusive
[1:38:55] Church praise the Lord
[1:38:59] hallelujah
[1:39:00] amen you see I don't believe that uh
[1:39:04] that uh you know uh uh uh uh it sound
[1:39:08] right to us but I believe that God in
[1:39:11] his his his desire for for his
[1:39:15] people bring all his children back
[1:39:18] through the new
[1:39:20] birth amen
[1:39:23] glory be to God it's almost like when
[1:39:26] Noah had the the the door the the Ark of
[1:39:29] the door open it was open for
[1:39:35] everybody praise the
[1:39:38] Lord but you have to come through the
[1:39:45] door you have to come through the door
[1:39:48] that was the entrance that we have to
[1:39:51] come
[1:39:52] through now so when I read this let's
[1:39:56] read uh Luke chapter 21
[1:39:59] here let's read Luke chapter
[1:40:13] 21 when you see people making
[1:40:16] decisions you know and then you sit down
[1:40:19] there you think why are they thinking
[1:40:21] what in their mind
[1:40:24] you look at a man age you look at his
[1:40:27] you know his credentials and it looks
[1:40:30] like his decision do not Marsh it only a
[1:40:33] drunk
[1:40:36] man only a man that is honor an
[1:40:39] influence will do
[1:40:41] that praise the
[1:40:44] Lord and this spiritual
[1:40:49] drunkenness is upon the word that's why
[1:40:53] we seeing the thing that is
[1:40:56] happening the things that used to have
[1:40:59] value
[1:41:00] family and all of these things they no
[1:41:03] longer have value that's what will
[1:41:05] happen when a man is drunk he's he
[1:41:07] doesn't have value he kicks everything
[1:41:09] he you know insult everybody spiritual
[1:41:12] drunkenness is affecting the minds of
[1:41:14] the
[1:41:20] people that common sense is no longer
[1:41:27] Luke chapter 21
[1:41:30] Jesus speaks
[1:41:33] here praise the
[1:41:37] Lord there was something here also I
[1:41:39] wanted for us to look at but time will
[1:41:41] not allow us so let's just read he says
[1:41:43] uh from chapter verse 32 verily I said
[1:41:47] unto you this generation shall now pass
[1:41:51] till all
[1:41:53] be fulfilled I wonder for us to look at
[1:41:55] this the generation that he was talking
[1:41:58] about because if you go back if you go
[1:42:01] back a little bit let me just tell your
[1:42:03] conscience maybe you go back home and
[1:42:05] study there uh verse
[1:42:07] 29 the Bible says and he speak this was
[1:42:10] Jesus he speak to them in Parable behold
[1:42:14] the Fi Tree and all the
[1:42:18] trees so we talk about the fake tree
[1:42:20] being Israel but Jesus Jus in this was
[1:42:25] also dealing with the fake tree and all
[1:42:28] the
[1:42:31] trees praise the Lord go back to history
[1:42:35] you will realize that after
[1:42:39] 1948 when Israel were was was declared
[1:42:43] uh a nation you realize that it starts
[1:42:47] to bring recognition and prosperity to
[1:42:50] all the nations around Israel
[1:42:53] so Jesus specifically said behold the
[1:42:57] fake tree which in scripture represent
[1:43:00] Israel in all the
[1:43:03] trees so the coming forth of the FR tree
[1:43:06] brings the identification of all the
[1:43:08] trees around
[1:43:12] it praise the Lord like I said we could
[1:43:16] look into that and and but that's not
[1:43:18] where I want to go this morning so we
[1:43:20] get back again to verse 35 very I said
[1:43:23] unto you this generation which mean the
[1:43:26] generation that see there that see the
[1:43:28] putting forth of the Fi Tree the Fi Tree
[1:43:31] buting and seeing the rising of the
[1:43:33] other trees that will come up he says
[1:43:35] that generation will not
[1:43:41] pass till all be fulfilled Heaven and
[1:43:44] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[1:43:47] not pass away take and take heed to
[1:43:50] yourself least at any time your heart be
[1:43:55] overcharged with
[1:43:57] sovereignty and
[1:44:00] drunkenness and cares of this
[1:44:04] life and so that they come upon you on
[1:44:09] the
[1:44:10] word for as a
[1:44:14] snail shall it come on all
[1:44:18] them that dwell upon the face of the
[1:44:22] Earth praise the Lord as a snail a snail
[1:44:25] is a
[1:44:26] trap praise the Lord you look at you
[1:44:30] look at uh uh the word prophecy you look
[1:44:33] at these things that are happening and
[1:44:35] you look at this snail if if I if I want
[1:44:39] to bring the snail into context I will
[1:44:42] compare it with the
[1:44:45] web the
[1:44:48] internet
[1:44:50] okay I will I will I I will compare it
[1:44:56] because glory to God are we together
[1:45:08] amen you know you look you look through
[1:45:12] prophecy sometimes you you try to figure
[1:45:16] it in your
[1:45:17] mind but you know uh uh prophecy is in
[1:45:23] interpreted when God bring it to
[1:45:25] pass amen when God bring his word to
[1:45:29] pass that's the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:45:31] we can prop we can say it means this it
[1:45:33] mean but when God bring it to pass you
[1:45:35] cannot argue amen you can argue when he
[1:45:39] said let there be light and there was
[1:45:40] light the light is there how why you
[1:45:43] want to explain it anyway then the light
[1:45:45] is there now so but you look at some
[1:45:48] things in the scripture you read almost
[1:45:51] like the Bible says all the nations
[1:45:53] shall go against Israel you think of how
[1:45:55] are they going to do it but the word has
[1:45:57] set up a a United Nation a United Nation
[1:46:01] represents all the
[1:46:04] nations so you see that there is a
[1:46:08] provision already made man has made a
[1:46:12] provision to fulfill the word of
[1:46:17] God praise the
[1:46:20] Lord so where the when if the United
[1:46:24] Nation is taking stand against uh uh
[1:46:27] Israel and you there you say well I
[1:46:29] don't believe that I don't stand for
[1:46:30] that your voice don't mean
[1:46:33] anything your flag is Hing in United
[1:46:37] Nations as long as you are under that
[1:46:41] flag your vote is
[1:46:47] in are we are you seeing the picture now
[1:46:51] so uh uh you know I'm I'm trying to
[1:46:54] bring this in a context so it you know
[1:46:57] we can we can we can be able to face it
[1:46:59] we can be able to see yeah now the Bible
[1:47:01] talks
[1:47:03] here about how this is going to come you
[1:47:06] know this drunkenness the Bible says
[1:47:09] again take heed verse uh uh uh 34 you
[1:47:12] know not to be overcharged you know with
[1:47:14] drunkenness and the K of this life and
[1:47:18] and and so that they come upon you on
[1:47:21] the word for as a
[1:47:25] snail shall it come on all them that
[1:47:28] dwell upon the face of the Earth wash
[1:47:32] you therefore and pray it always that
[1:47:34] you may be uh accountable
[1:47:38] wealthy accounted worthy to escape all
[1:47:41] these things that shall come upon that
[1:47:44] that shall come to pass and to stand
[1:47:46] before the son of man praise the Lord
[1:47:50] amen now so we see
[1:47:53] you you see uh uh uh
[1:47:57] uh you will also realize that when you
[1:48:01] look at what I've just buil for uh built
[1:48:05] for you uh uh about
[1:48:08] 1970 there with uh with Mr Pentecost you
[1:48:12] will realize that uh yeah I mean my mind
[1:48:16] going in many different ways here but
[1:48:18] let me just hold some things here
[1:48:20] together you will see the the advice we
[1:48:23] we in uh uh a kind of a technology
[1:48:26] age amen praise the Lord and the father
[1:48:31] of the matter there is that there is
[1:48:34] there
[1:48:36] is there is no kind of
[1:48:41] for drug that is affecting the word more
[1:48:47] than what is coming from through the
[1:48:50] internet there are people that are taken
[1:48:53] in abused substance there people that
[1:48:57] you know uh uh uh you know they they are
[1:49:00] on the being classified by doctors to be
[1:49:04] uh you know alcoholic and all of that
[1:49:08] but in the proportion of how the the the
[1:49:12] web the internet is affecting the
[1:49:16] minds of our generation of this age I
[1:49:21] mean is both young old and everybody
[1:49:25] that is living in this
[1:49:28] age praise the Lord amen because there
[1:49:33] is more cause of
[1:49:35] depression there is more cause of
[1:49:41] anxieties there are things that people
[1:49:44] are dealing with in their life just
[1:49:47] because they have been affected by what
[1:49:51] is coming through the
[1:49:53] internet young people Minds have been
[1:49:56] abused exposed to a lot of things and
[1:49:58] young people have uh you know uh uh uh
[1:50:02] uh you know uh this virgin their minds
[1:50:04] with all such of things that is all
[1:50:06] streaming out of
[1:50:10] here this is our lord
[1:50:13] Jesus he's saying that this Spirit uh
[1:50:16] spiritual drunkenness will come upon the
[1:50:19] word as a snail
[1:50:23] praise the
[1:50:25] Lord they will come upon the word as a
[1:50:32] snail now so we see
[1:50:35] here a church system we see a
[1:50:39] woman in Scarlet Red with a red golden a
[1:50:43] a golden cup in her hand filled with the
[1:50:46] blood of the
[1:50:49] Saints now what what does that tell you
[1:50:53] what does that tell
[1:50:55] you her purpose her mission is to just
[1:51:00] kill you
[1:51:03] spiritually
[1:51:05] amen is to just kill you spiritually
[1:51:08] just to have the form of godliness be
[1:51:11] called a Christian but we don't have the
[1:51:13] life to back it
[1:51:19] up as long as we can just fill fill the
[1:51:22] church with you know just bunch of

[1:51:32] break us from our habits where's the
[1:51:34] power of God that can change our
[1:51:38] lives and I believe that that God is
[1:51:40] still
[1:51:44] alive he can
[1:51:48] deliver he can heal he can save
[1:51:57] not just to play the our our our ReliOn

[1:54:17] word drinking from his word drinking
[1:54:20] from his fountain
[1:54:29] when we see the influence that is upon
[1:54:31] the word we see the influence that is

[1:54:36] infiltrating into the church we ask
[1:54:39] ourselves what are we

[1:57:16] bit now this will be some of Moses last
[1:57:20] statement he told the children of
[1:57:23] Israel and uh uh uh and he said he said
[1:57:27] this to them before he should leave now
[1:57:30] if you if you look at the setting of the
[1:57:31] scripture de Deuteronomy 28 was where
[1:57:35] Moses read all the
[1:57:37] blessings amen if you do this you will
[1:57:39] be blessed you will be the head you will

[1:57:46] also read the
[1:57:49] curses the things that you would do that
[1:57:52] you will be plagued with
[1:57:54] curse and when we study this back if
[1:57:57] anybody can remember when we studied
[1:57:59] this
[1:58:00] back you go back to the to the Bible you
[1:58:03] study this back the the curse and the
[1:58:08] blessing which one they were to say Amen
[1:58:17] to they went to say Amen to the curse
[1:58:22] if you go back and read the Bible you
[1:58:24] will see there when the blessings were
[1:58:27] pronounced they never say
[1:58:29] Amen why because God will bring his
[1:58:32] blessings
[1:58:34] anyway amen he put his blessing upon the
[1:58:37] just and the unjust that's what the
[1:58:39] Bible says but when Moses was reading
[1:58:43] the curses he was bringing the people
[1:58:46] into an
[1:58:49] agreement praise the Lord amen
[1:58:53] but you see the church have it in
[1:58:56] reverse when we say you will prosper
[1:59:00] amen you will be the head
[1:59:03] amen praise the Lord but then when the
[1:59:07] preacher comes and start calling you out
[1:59:09] for the wrong that you are doing you
[1:59:10] don't say
[1:59:15] Amen we got it in the
[1:59:18] reverse praise the Lord now that that
[1:59:21] was just something there but so when we
[1:59:23] go back there I want us to look at some
[1:59:25] few things let's look into verse 16 now
[1:59:28] so you will see here Moses is going to
[1:59:32] remind these people and there's a reason
[1:59:34] why I want to bring this like I said if
[1:59:36] I if I can be able to do good on this we
[1:59:38] will close here praise the Lord
[1:59:40] Deuteronomy chapter 29:1 16 let's let's
[1:59:44] just go back
[1:59:45] in and uh and read a little bit
[1:59:52] you love the Lord
[1:59:56] amen for you know how we have D we have
[2:00:01] DW in the land of Egypt and how we came
[2:00:05] through the Nations now if you want to
[2:00:09] take it in the context of the church the
[2:00:12] church never came through the Nations
[2:00:13] the church came through
[2:00:16] denominations amen the church have
[2:00:19] traveled through denominations to where
[2:00:21] we are
[2:00:22] now so let's continue to
[2:00:31] read for you know
[2:00:35] how you know how we have deal with uh uh
[2:00:39] de in the dwell in the land of Egypt and
[2:00:42] how we came through the Nations which ye
[2:00:46] pass by next
[2:00:49] verse and we have seen their
[2:00:52] Abominations and their Idols now keep
[2:00:55] the church in her journey now we have
[2:00:58] seen the Abominations of the churches we
[2:01:01] have seen their Idols we have seen their
[2:01:03] Woods we have seen their Stones we have
[2:01:05] seen their silver and their gold I mean
[2:01:09] uh if you if you if you really get down
[2:01:11] to places you know I used to travel
[2:01:13] through Benin over to Nigeria whenever I
[2:01:16] was traveling around there and that's
[2:01:18] when I really understood uh uh you know
[2:01:21] uh uh uh people that are from that
[2:01:23] region will know what what the celestial
[2:01:26] church was all about the harura church
[2:01:28] if if just to give you context but these
[2:01:31] were people that were missing calm and
[2:01:37] Voodoo praise the
[2:01:39] Lord they were missing calym in voodoo
[2:01:52] are we
[2:01:56] together you remember when I spoke on
[2:01:58] the message Rachel stole her father
[2:02:02] Idol that's how the church has
[2:02:05] traveled the church has never been able
[2:02:08] to let go of her
[2:02:11] Idols every time they move into a new
[2:02:13] Revival they carry more
[2:02:16] Idols the Lutheran Carri the same way of
[2:02:19] praying the same candle burden that he
[2:02:21] took from ISM metodist carry the same
[2:02:23] thing over the church always carry her
[2:02:34] Idols praise the

[2:03:27] serve the gods of these
[2:03:30] nations praise the
[2:03:33] Lord
[2:03:37] amen our object of worship because there
[2:03:41] is no worship that is complete without
[2:03:43] an
[2:03:44] object our object of worship is the
[2:03:49] word is this word it's the word of God
[2:03:52] that we bow down to is the word of God
[2:03:55] we say Amen
[2:03:57] to praise the
[2:04:00] Lord that's why we must bring it back to
[2:04:02] the
[2:04:10] word let's continue to
[2:04:15] read least there should be any man woman
[2:04:20] or family tribe whose turn whose heart
[2:04:24] turned away this day from the Lord the
[2:04:26] god to go and serve the gods of this
[2:04:30] nation least there should
[2:04:32] be among you a root that bear God or one
[2:04:38] world in the New Testament Paul would
[2:04:40] type that to the root of bitterness
[2:04:41] let's continue to
[2:04:44] go and it and it come to pass when he
[2:04:48] heareth the words of this curse
[2:04:52] which is now in Deuteronomy 29 when he
[2:04:56] hear those curses that he blessed
[2:04:59] himself in his
[2:05:02] heart praise the
[2:05:04] Lord
[2:05:06] amen it's is the Moses is throwing a
[2:05:11] challenge of defilement he's trying to
[2:05:14] identify a
[2:05:18] spirit that he seen among the people how
[2:05:21] many times time had they defied
[2:05:24] him why you brought us here it was
[2:05:27] better for us to be to go back into
[2:05:32] Egypt every time the people will God in
[2:05:36] his Mercy will meet their needs he would
[2:05:38] give them a water he would give them
[2:05:41] food for them to eat but he constantly
[2:05:43] seeing the spirit of defilement the
[2:05:46] people was continuing to defy and he's
[2:05:48] saying I'm reading this curse to you
[2:05:51] amen if anybody will say listening to
[2:05:55] this and say and blessing thems in their
[2:05:58] in their
[2:05:59] heart praise the Lord when you know that
[2:06:03] uh your life does not march with what
[2:06:05] the word have
[2:06:07] said praise the
[2:06:09] lord we must be seeking God's
[2:06:13] mercy praise the Lord you see the church
[2:06:15] have this back to the sender it's not
[2:06:17] the back to the sender that send it
[2:06:22] it's not you saying back to the sender
[2:06:23] that send
[2:06:25] it the thing you sending to the sender
[2:06:27] if something in your life Mar that thing
[2:06:30] is not going
[2:06:38] anywhere are we together let's continue
[2:06:40] to read I'm trying to close up here but
[2:06:44] you are holding me and it come and it
[2:06:46] come to pass when you hear the words of
[2:06:49] this curse that he bless himself in his
[2:06:52] heart saying I shall have peace though I
[2:06:56] walk in the
[2:06:59] imagination of my
[2:07:02] heart and add drunkenness to thirst now
[2:07:08] look at that
[2:07:09] word look at that word now don't think
[2:07:15] that Moses was trying to tell the
[2:07:18] people I'm telling you I'm giving you
[2:07:21] the word of the Lord but if you don't
[2:07:23] listen to the word and then you start
[2:07:25] drinking alcohol that's not what he was
[2:07:27] talking about he has dentifying
[2:07:30] something that when you get to the place
[2:07:32] where you start to uh uh take your
[2:07:36] imagination above the word you are
[2:07:40] addding drunkenness to
[2:07:44] thirst you are bringing yourself to the
[2:07:46] place where you are exalting your
[2:07:49] thoughts above God's
[2:07:53] word if any of you will look at the word
[2:07:56] I'm reading these curses to you and in
[2:07:59] the imagination of your mind you are
[2:08:01] saying to yourself that uh oh well I
[2:08:04] mean that is not for me you know it's
[2:08:06] not not me I mean as far I know my life
[2:08:09] is going to be well you know God says I
[2:08:11] will be the head I will not be the day
[2:08:13] and and you just carry yourself that way
[2:08:16] you are walking in the
[2:08:18] imagination of your heart PR praise the
[2:08:21] Lord he said by doing that you are
[2:08:25] hiding
[2:08:27] drunkenness to
[2:08:31] thirst are we together let's continue to
[2:08:41] read the Lord will not spare him but
[2:08:44] then the anger of the Lord and his
[2:08:46] jealousy shall smoke against the man and
[2:08:50] all the curses that are written in this
[2:08:53] book shall shall lay upon him and the
[2:08:56] Lord shall blot out his name from under
[2:09:01] heaven now that's where I wanted to get
[2:09:04] to with uh with uh uh this spiritual
[2:09:12] drunkenness now so God is giving them a
[2:09:16] straight word here what was they warn
[2:09:20] against they were warn
[2:09:23] against attaching thems to
[2:09:26] Idols praise the Lord
[2:09:29] amen attaching thems to idols and
[2:09:32] picking you know uh things from here
[2:09:34] there Here There and what another so but
[2:09:38] what you you will see here is that God
[2:09:41] promised that if any one of them is
[2:09:44] caught up in
[2:09:46] death it will
[2:09:48] become a spirit of drunkenness that will
[2:09:51] be upon them and then what will happen
[2:09:54] is that their names will be blot off
[2:09:57] from under heaven and God meant what he
[2:10:01] said because you will realize that in
[2:10:05] Israel
[2:10:07] joining there were two
[2:10:09] tribes that were blotted
[2:10:12] out and these two tribes were associated
[2:10:16] to
[2:10:19] Idols are we together
[2:10:22] amen
[2:10:23] now because of time year uh
[2:10:32] uh because of
[2:10:37] time but like I said I'm I'm I'm I'm
[2:10:39] trying to close on
[2:10:43] this
[2:10:47] uhhuh now so you will F of that
[2:10:53] there there are history of two tribes
[2:10:55] that were blotted out because of uh of
[2:10:57] of idolatry if you actually go into
[2:11:01] first king chapter 12 just to give you
[2:11:03] an example or a picture of how that
[2:11:06] happened that was during the time of
[2:11:08] jerram and rebron rebron was the son of
[2:11:11] Solomon that inherited the throne after
[2:11:14] his father jebron was the captain of the
[2:11:17] army but rebron was the one that you
[2:11:19] know told the people you know my father
[2:11:21] was light on you I I'm going to deal
[2:11:23] with you I whip you like scorpions and
[2:11:25] all of that and the kingdom split it
[2:11:28] amen and jebron came to power but
[2:11:32] because of his fear that the people
[2:11:35] would constantly go to
[2:11:37] Jerusalem he build two Idols one in
[2:11:42] Ephron amen are we together yes and one
[2:11:47] in
[2:11:49] Dan praise the Lord so you can see a
[2:11:52] very a very perfect
[2:11:55] picture of the
[2:11:58] Trinity which All Leads back to
[2:12:03] idolatry they have in Jerusalem they
[2:12:06] have in ephran they have
[2:12:08] done they can choose to go to any one of
[2:12:11] them and he told them yeah Israel these
[2:12:14] are the gods that brought you out of
[2:12:18] Egypt AOL train with was introduced to
[2:12:22] the
[2:12:23] people praise the
[2:12:26] Lord and that is the reason why to see
[2:12:29] to see how God keep his
[2:12:35] word when he was calling the names of
[2:12:38] the tribe in the Book of Revelation he
[2:12:41] blotted their
[2:12:43] names the names of ephran and Dan is not
[2:12:46] in is not in the in the road C in the
[2:12:49] Book of Revelation
[2:12:57] are we
[2:13:00] together so what am I saying what am I
[2:13:03] going to with all of this is that the
[2:13:06] the the the the the spiritual
[2:13:08] drunkenness and influence that the word
[2:13:11] is
[2:13:12] under drinking from the system that is
[2:13:15] coming through all of our system all of
[2:13:18] our system is coming through the Schools
[2:13:20] is coming through through everything
[2:13:22] everything is promoting this Beast
[2:13:32] system expose our children to things at
[2:13:35] at at at their young
[2:13:38] ages praise the
[2:13:41] Lord but what is it leading to is
[2:13:44] leading to
[2:13:47] idolatry why because the minds of the
[2:13:50] young woman get confused God is no
[2:13:53] longer mentioned in the school the Bible
[2:13:55] is not read in the school Jesus is just
[2:13:58] something that is played down and that
[2:14:00] image is destroyed from their mind all
[2:14:04] they want to become Hollywood
[2:14:08] stars because that's that's what that's
[2:14:10] what the media is pushing
[2:14:19] out are you seeing the picture
[2:14:23] so God was warning them that idolatry
[2:14:26] will lead
[2:14:31] you or that that that that spiritual
[2:14:37] drunkenness when you are led by the
[2:14:40] imagination of your own heart it's the
[2:14:42] word of God that should lead
[2:14:48] us we are sheep of his pasture
[2:14:53] he should lead up by his rod and his
[2:14:59] staff but when we when we are led by the
[2:15:02] proud imagination of our
[2:15:05] heart and we want to make ourself who we
[2:15:08] think we want to you didn't make
[2:15:10] yourself in the first
[2:15:12] place so that idea that you can make
[2:15:15] yourself where you want to be just don't
[2:15:17] don't go there
[2:15:25] but what
[2:15:30] happens it's an
[2:15:33] intoxication that the media is putting
[2:15:35] out the system is
[2:15:38] feeding praise the
[2:15:44] Lord the system makes you to think there
[2:15:46] it cares for you but it really don't
[2:15:48] cares for
[2:15:49] you praise the
[2:15:51] Lord amen no he don't care for
[2:15:58] you because if the system if the system
[2:16:02] will give us peace and happiness the
[2:16:05] system will not make money the system
[2:16:08] only make money when you don't have
[2:16:11] peace when there is trouble when there
[2:16:13] is Strive that's when the system make
[2:16:15] money because we can pile laws and bills
[2:16:22] when we continue to have gun violence we
[2:16:24] continue to have problem in the school
[2:16:26] we continue to have all of these things
[2:16:28] then the system knows how to ride and
[2:16:30] make
[2:16:39] money praise the
[2:16:41] Lord so you see just like I said I was I
[2:16:45] was I was just carried away you know
[2:16:47] with that with that whole think you know
[2:16:50] actually it was it was uh uh brother
[2:16:54] Liam that told me that you know I was I
[2:16:57] was driving him he says he told me he
[2:16:59] says did you saw that thing they did in
[2:17:01] France uh uh uh I said no I've not saw
[2:17:04] i' not seen anything on the Olympic
[2:17:06] years so I went home and and I started
[2:17:08] looking I said oh my
[2:17:11] God oh my
[2:17:14] God praise the Lord but if you know it
[2:17:17] really didn't mean anything to me this
[2:17:18] is a falling word amen like I said I
[2:17:21] mean uh uh uh it's I mean because of the
[2:17:25] weakness of the church you know because
[2:17:28] of the weakness of the church if you if
[2:17:30] you take it most of the people that go
[2:17:32] down there they they all belong to one
[2:17:34] church or
[2:17:35] another but yet to them is
[2:17:38] entertainment praise the
[2:17:40] Lord you tell me about this when men
[2:17:43] like uh uh uh the wiger woods was
[2:17:46] running through England and then John
[2:17:48] Smith and all of those men were
[2:17:50] preaching the go gospel and and all of
[2:17:52] that you know those are men that would
[2:17:54] call for rain to come down from heaven
[2:17:57] and and and you know it it have the
[2:18:00] nation on on the fear the people
[2:18:04] reference the things of
[2:18:07] God now the church has is just become a
[2:18:10] laughing
[2:18:14] stock we just want some kind of a
[2:18:16] comedian to uh comedian to come and
[2:18:19] dramatize so we can just life and crack
[2:18:21] our side go home and you know and then
[2:18:24] and then just continue in our
[2:18:29] life the emphasis on biblical
[2:18:32] principle are we getting back to the
[2:18:34] place to to
[2:18:41] repent repentance is all where it begins
[2:18:49] from baptising in the name of the Lord
[2:18:51] Jesus
[2:18:54] Christ but just like I said from the
[2:18:56] beginning the church goes with that mind
[2:18:59] that think is there is is is is
[2:19:03] there God will have to deliver us and he
[2:19:05] deliver the church when he brings the
[2:19:07] revelation of the word when the people
[2:19:09] can see it it's right in the
[2:19:13] scripture it's right there in the
[2:19:18] scripture there's nothing there in the
[2:19:20] Bible for baptism class and catechism
[2:19:23] class the Bible says uh you know baptism
[2:19:27] is a symbol of good conscious towards
[2:19:29] God that's where it begin from that
[2:19:32] someone is now having a good conscience
[2:19:35] towards
[2:19:39] God that's where it begins
[2:19:47] from but we have all of these things
[2:19:50] play out we have our own
[2:19:51] self-righteousness that is written out
[2:19:54] you know we have to meet those
[2:20:00] things just like Jesus said they are not
[2:20:03] going in and they keep stopping other
[2:20:05] people from going in he says that was
[2:20:07] the way the Pharisees
[2:20:11] were the word is honor it if you can't
[2:20:14] see it you got to open your
[2:20:18] eyes moros are gone
[2:20:22] common courtesies are
[2:20:24] gone it's no longer part of our
[2:20:28] languages it's all insult and
[2:20:32] cheeks those are the common vocabularies
[2:20:34] that is out
[2:20:36] there it's only it's only the man that
[2:20:38] is drunk that people knows that as soon
[2:20:41] as he's talking say leaveing he's drunk
[2:20:42] that's why he's
[2:20:43] insulting but insult has become our
[2:20:46] normal language that's the music that is
[2:20:49] played and the people dance to their own
[2:20:59] insult the Bible says there will be a
[2:21:01] strong
[2:21:03] delusion that the people will believe a
[2:21:07] lie and that's the spirit that the age
[2:21:09] is
[2:21:12] honor but Jesus is warning us
[2:21:17] here that we must not be caught up in
[2:21:19] that
[2:21:22] we must not be caught up in
[2:21:24] there we must not come under that
[2:21:41] influence but once again the word has
[2:21:45] put us on the
[2:21:48] stage and every
[2:21:53] every Bible
[2:21:55] believer must Open the Eyes to the
[2:21:58] things that is happening around
[2:22:00] us because every Daye of our life
[2:22:02] scriptures are being
[2:22:09] fulfilled praise the
[2:22:17] Lord if we are giving ourself
[2:22:21] to wrong influence like I said watch
[2:22:24] your
[2:22:25] influence watch your steps you will know
[2:22:27] what is influencing you and pretty soon
[2:22:30] you will know what what you are drinking
[2:22:32] or where you are drinking
[2:22:34] from praise the Lord and that is to
[2:22:37] every one of
[2:22:39] us that is to every one of
[2:22:42] us we have to watch this thing it's a
[2:22:46] spirit it's a
[2:22:48] spirit you know it's a Spirit it could
[2:22:51] be from uh you know just just an
[2:22:54] innocent video on
[2:22:56] YouTube and then before you realize you
[2:22:59] finish conceiving something in your
[2:23:05] mind it's a
[2:23:08] spirit that's the reason why we must
[2:23:10] guide our
[2:23:12] heart with the word of God and with
[2:23:18] prayer musicians you can
[2:23:21] come I hope I said something to
[2:23:24] encourage you this
[2:23:26] morning amen I just wanted to bring you
[2:23:29] down the road of uh uh uh history a
[2:23:33] little
[2:23:34] bit you know and uh
[2:23:42] uh but that's where we are you know
[2:23:45] that's where we are we put more emphasis
[2:23:48] on the word
[2:23:50] like I said the communion is just a
[2:23:52] symbol of the word the communion do not
[2:23:55] have no higher value than the word of
[2:23:58] God praise the Lord that's the reason
[2:24:01] why Paul in the book of Corinthian told
[2:24:04] us to examine ourself by the word before
[2:24:07] we partake of the
[2:24:09] communion because the communion is
[2:24:11] representing the
[2:24:15] word but we all need the word I mean you
[2:24:19] come to church this morning you didn't
[2:24:21] tell yourself oh you know I I I I I lied
[2:24:24] yesterday or I did something you come
[2:24:26] you come into the house of God this
[2:24:28] morning believing there oh you know uh

[2:24:36] Lord you you you take that Liberty to be
[2:24:39] able to
[2:24:40] come and that is the same thing a
[2:24:43] Believer must be able to do we must
[2:24:45] examine ourself and bring our weaknesses
[2:24:48] at the feet of Jesus Christ
[2:24:53] we are not preaching sinless Perfection
[2:24:56] no but we are telling you there's a
[2:24:59] blood that speak better things we are
[2:25:02] telling you there's a power that can
[2:25:04] deliver we can telling you we are
[2:25:07] telling you there's a hope in the gospel
[2:25:09] that can change our life

[2:28:08] together while the music plays
[2:28:12] softly I want us to pray together in
[2:28:15] your
[2:28:16] seat and uh let's just all come to the
[2:28:20] Lord just like I said this these are
[2:28:22] things I mean there are things
[2:28:25] that like I said whether it is uh
[2:28:27] YouTube is your platform or Facebook is
[2:28:30] your platform there are things that you
[2:28:32] just look at and and you realize it just
[2:28:35] making you
[2:28:37] angry you just hear some things you just
[2:28:40] see some
[2:28:41] things and it just it just having that
[2:28:44] direct effect on
[2:28:46] you it should not be
[2:28:50] my question is do the word has those
[2:28:52] kind of effect on us do we read God's
[2:28:56] word and we have an immediate
[2:29:00] effect and say Lord this is what your
[2:29:02] word
[2:29:06] [Music]
[2:29:08] says is it something someone someone is
[2:29:11] saying or or something that someone is
[2:29:13] doing and you know that we see it or we
[2:29:17] hear it and the way it impact our life
[2:29:21] [Music]
[2:29:32] I don't know what you're dealing with I
[2:29:34] don't know where your mind is and where
[2:29:35] your heart
[2:29:37] is but just like Moses said let us not
[2:29:40] add drunkenness to
[2:29:44] thirst there's no reason why we must
[2:29:47] gratify our self in our own imagination
[2:29:52] the Bible say a contr and a broken heart
[2:29:55] God will not
[2:29:57] [Music]
[2:29:58] despise a heart that would
[2:30:01] say it's me again
[2:30:03] [Music]
[2:30:06] Lord a heart that would say Lord I need
[2:30:09] more of
[2:30:10] [Music]
[2:30:13] you a heart that would say Lord this
[2:30:16] area of my life
[2:30:19] [Music]
[2:30:23] and just like I said just just from that
[2:30:26] example we read this
[2:30:28] morning see how that wrong attitude
[2:30:31] affected that little
[2:30:32] child and he was going to
[2:30:36] die from polio unless God was
[2:30:43] [Music]
[2:30:45] merciful let's let's watch our our our
[2:30:48] our our attitude
[2:30:50] with our
[2:30:54] kids it is our responsibility to be able
[2:30:57] to bring them give them an
[2:31:02] example they must be able to learn from
[2:31:05] [Music]
[2:31:15] us the mind the spirit of a of a young
[2:31:18] child is so tender
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:24] that it could they could be destroyed in
[2:31:26] thousand different ways if you shut them
[2:31:30] [Music]
[2:31:35] off no matter how what whatever silly
[2:31:38] thing that they are
[2:31:41] saying allow them to express their mind
[2:31:44] let them exercise their
[2:31:46] mind let them exercise their mind
[2:31:50] [Music]
[2:31:55] it all helps the development of a
[2:31:59] child you as an other you think that
[2:32:02] it's stupid but to them it's
[2:32:04] not it's something they are they are oh
[2:32:07] I mean they are so impressed about it's
[2:32:09] something they have they have captivated
[2:32:11] there something that is on their mind
[2:32:14] [Music]
[2:32:20] I'll tell you when I when I when I uh
[2:32:23] heard that doing the prayer line I I can
