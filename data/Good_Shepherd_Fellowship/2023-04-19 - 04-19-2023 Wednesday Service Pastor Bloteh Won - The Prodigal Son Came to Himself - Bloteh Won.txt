praise the Lord amen I started something uh Sunday just before the preacher came up and pretty much a kind of read the wrong scripture not wrong in the sense of the talk but that was not where I wanted to go tonight Luke Chapter 15. let's read Luke chapter 15 look into one of the familiar uh uh story of what the Bible the story of The Prodigal Son tonight I want to say speak on a little message the prodigal come to himself Luke chapter 15. I just want to set a scene here for what I want to go into let's read from verse 1. then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees and the stripe Mummers saying this man receives Sinners and eat it with them and he speak this parable unto them saying let us pray heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus we will pray that God you come take internal thoughts from your word tonight Lord father Place ourself in your hands and we place the congregation also Lord may you speak to us tonight Lord in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you may have your seed now so uh for one we see a certain year of Jesus congregation the crowd that he was speaking this Parable to that's that's what I want you to picture now in your mind so Jesus is having publicants we're still reading now publicans and sinners uh on one side if we will say and then he's also having uh the the Pharisees and the stripes on the other side they had to be part of this group for them to for them to murmur they have to be there to be able to see and I saw Jesus realizing his uh crowd his congregation he decided to speak this Parable unto them and uh and and which of course is the parable uh he's he he takes up different Parable year he says what man of you have in a hundred sheep if he lost one of them does not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when and when he have found it he lay it on his shoulder rejoicing praise the Lord he when he found the lost sheep he laid on his shoulder brother Graham said that's his stronger path of a man body praise the Lord he says why Jesus we cast out evil spirit with his finger he would take sons and daughters on his shoulder amen so you are more heavier than evil spirits you are more heavier than devil do you believe there tonight you have you are heavyweight praise the Lord he have to carry you on his shoulder you are not as light like an evil spirit an evil spirit he just need a finger to get it away but when it comes to a son or a daughter he has to put his entire weight on you to be able to carry you praise the Lord you are a heavyweight if you want to know how much heavy you are see how much time Jesus fell carrying the cross praise the Lord because it was it was the weight of our sin I was on that cross now he says when he found the Sheep he put on his shoulder and he come home and called his friends together Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost and I said unto you the likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner they are repented more than over 99 just person which need no repentance praise the Lord look at that 99 just person 99 just person which need no repentance praise the Lord what just what Justice did they have a self-righteous Justice praise the Lord because it should take repentance to bring you godliness Amen to bring you to wrap you in God's righteousness so Jesus in one way here he's addressing his crowd because he see this bunch of Pharisees and shrives that are holding to the Lord yeah India white garment neatly dressed you know they get their haircuts right you know their beer ship right and everything but they were 90 they were classified in the 1909 just person that needed no repentance I will tell you until we get out of here we need repentance every day praise the Lord amen we need repentance every day why because we backslide every day are we together now Jesus went on and he says uh uh either one Woman verse 8 he says having ten pieces of silver if she lose one thus not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she have found it she she calleth her friends and the neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I have lost praise the Lord amen now so you see Jesus goes from the state of a sinner then he talks about a wife they have lost a virtue praise the Lord now just like I said God have to speak in a way where we can understand but we have to realize that as the heaven is higher than the earth so are his thoughts when Jesus was speaking these words the tasks that were in his mind were very deep the thoughts that were in his mind was covering the entire Redemptive plane Jesus was not just preaching a fussy message he was not just preaching a message to make the Pharisees mad but what actually he was trying to do is to slowly like brother Branham said in Christ is the Minister of God revealed God was slowly unfolding his great internal thoughts so he come and talk about a sinner that the father has redeemed and has brought home but then he moved to the next story and starts to talk about a woman which is a type of the church and this time this woman has lost something that is valuable to her are we together praise the Lord so we we are slowly unfolding into God's tasks tonight she calleth all her neighbor together saying Rejoice with me for our for I have found a peace which I have lost likewise I said unto you there is joy in heaven there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repented then he go on again he gets into this story then he talks about and he says a certain man have two sons praise the Lord so he talks about a sinner that being saved and brought to the church and now that sinner now has lost a vet you and now he's going to go into now another stage of redemption all the stages of redemption praise the Lord he talks about a sinner being saved he's brought into the church and now he has lost his prayer life he has lost some sense of dedication to the word and he prayed and he seek and he cleaned his house cleaned his life out take all the trash out of his house the dirty movies the daddy music and he get everything out praise the Lord I want you to follow me tonight because I'm going to talk about the prodigal son in a completely different way and I pray that the Lord will bless you tonight amen and now he's moving now to adoption after being safe after you have repented of your sin and you have come into the church and and you have tested of the good word of God praise the Lord now he's moving to another stage he's going to talk about adoption they have to do with the possession of inheritance are we together a certain man have two sons old brother Brandon chase after the opening of the seal the Bible became a new book and we are so glad to read it with the art of a prophet praise the Lord the Bible stories are not the same old stories because they were all God's thoughts praise the Lord they were all God's thoughts and every time you read it it unfolds and if you were in the mind of God you see yourself in it and he said a certain man have two sons praise the Lord and the and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goose that follow through me and he divided unto them he's living in that many days after the young son gathered all together he took a journey into a far country praise the Lord he had a gift from the father father give him a gift praise the Lord amen and which of course is an inheritance and the Bible says here he joined into a fire country and there wasted his substance wave a righteous living and when he has spent all the other roles of Mighty farming in the land and he began to be in want praise the Lord and he went and joined himself to the citizens of that country and he's and he sent him into his field to feel the swamp brother Ben I was listening to the message prodigal son brother Bram says he says the prophet of God he said here he says he says look what this what this product of some this afternoon where he was the worst place now you think about it now yery is Jewish Pharisees there and and the worst brother Branham just I mean Jesus just making this story to look so much ugly he grew up talking about everything but he uh place the the void into feeding with the swan hey my goodness I could see those viruses oh my goodness you know what uh uh I mean he's gone he's lost completely you know that's what could be running into a legalist mind and the scripture says and he who uh Finn have fill his ballot with the harsh death the swan did eat and old man gave gave unto him verse 17 and when he came to himself that's where I want to stop tonight because that's where my my inspiration is that's the chord of my inspiration when he came to himself so it is The Prodigal Son came to himself I said come to himself but it's actually he came to himself now so uh uh what I want us to realize is that a Jesus said imagine he never came to destroy the Lord but he came to fulfill it praise the Lord and there is no one you realize in the scripture one that caught the law like our lord Jesus your year he says it is written and he quotes from from Moses and he called so let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 21. and see that when Moses was giving this that might look like a lord or an instruction Moses was actually prophesying Moses was given a prophecy praise the Lord if Jesus never came to fulfill to destroy the Lord but to fulfill the Lord so there are a lot of things that are lying in the Commandments of the Lord there are a prophecy and that's one way I want for us to look at tonight praise the Lord chapter 21 let's read from verse 18. praise the Lord if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will Now obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother now you have to realize that these Pharisees and Stripes these were men that studied the word the new as soon as you are talking they know exactly which message you are talking you are speaking from amen they know where the court is because I mean they have read the message over and over and over and over so if Jesus is here talking about a son that is going to take the father inheritance and go out into a strange country and waste it it's very easy for the Pharisees to link him to this commandment praise the Lord because he never went out to bring proud and glory to the name of his father he went out to waste the inheritance of his father so definitely he is a rebellious son now so you see Jesus was tapping into the law that was given to Moses and he's taking a thought from that law because all of these words that Moses said they were divine pops praise the Lord you think about it almighty God knew that those people their hearts were unconverted just like we spoke about a set of Refuge God knew that there will be violence he knew that they were not born again he knew their hearts would be stubborn they will be jealousy and and and and and and and people were lying and things so he had to give them City of Refuge so whenever there was a trouble they can run into it quickly he made provision because he knows our hearts he made provision because he knows what we are made out of so you tell me now almighty God The Sovereign God knowing that these people are not born again praise the Lord and he's giving a commitment if there is a stubborn if a man is not born again your heart is stubborn we are all born with a stubborn nature the first nature is stubborn we come to the word speaking lies we love to have our will praise the Lord glory be to God I think the ones that are nursing newborn can even succeed in the stubbornness praise the Lord amen glory be to God because until you give that baby food is going to cry you can play all the music sing all the nice songs if they say I want to eat I want to eat praise the Lord if you leave that baby there on the bed and go and pray Lord Jesus praise the Lord the prophet of God said there is no way for the baby to be able to express and say how what they need then to cry amen so I want us to see the touch here so God was not giving the people a commitment moreover he was prophesying to them let's follow a little bit oh I love the word of God Amen if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have trust in him will not hacking unto them praise the Lord then shall his father and mother lay hold on him and bring him out onto the others of the city and on to the gate of his place praise the Lord glory be to God this son might have done the worst because before you can get a mother hat to go against her son for a public this race then you have crossed the limit before you will get a mother son to bring him to the public then you have crossed the limit are we together but this is the word of God Moses was not speaking his own tasks he was speaking God's word praise the Lord amen amen are we together let's enjoy the word tonight then he shot his father and a mother lay hold of him bring him the next verse says and they shall say it unto the Elders of the city this our son is stubborn and rebellious and he will not obey our voice he is a glantner and a drunker are we together do you remember anywhere in the scripture where those phrases were used oh yeah Luke Chapter 7 for steady fall let's read it Luke chapter 7 verse 34 praise the Lord the Bible says Jesus said the son of man is come eating and drinking and yes said behold a grunted US man and a wine Barber a wine Barber is a drunker praise the Lord are we together are you seeing the picture Jesus said behold the son of man cometh he come eating and drinking and you said that he is a grown to nurse and he is a warm Berber he's a drunker and a friend of publicans and sinners now when the when the Prodigal Son went away he became the friends of public hand and sinners he became a drunker praise the Lord if he was not granting us he uh it's a sense of being wistful are we together or just wait a minute it will get more clearer to you this our son is stubborn and rebellious verse 21 and all the men of the city shall Stone him with stones that he died so shall thou put evil away from ammonia and all Israel shall yea in fear praise the Lord do you really believe that thou will put evil away when the Nature has not changed when they never had a sacrifice that can affect the human soul they will honor the blood of bulls and gods do you believe that stone in a boy that was that was that were rebellious would take evil away oh I love the word of God let's continue to read a little bit and if a man commit a sin water of death he shall be put to death and thou shall hang him on a tree thou shall hang him on a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree praise the Lord Moses here giving this instruction it looks like a lord to the people speaking about Christ the one that was called the friend of sinners praise the Lord this is the very verse that that Paul in the book of Galatians chapter 3 verse 13 will refer to that curse is anyone the hankered upon the tree a God how the mind of God is all big it's a fountain of Truth praise the Lord his morning shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shall in any wise bury him that day for he that is Hank is a curse of God that the lamb be not defined which the Lord thy God gaveth thee for and inheritance this is cavalry this is exactly what Joseph of amateur's date to go and ask for the body of Jesus Christ why because he became a rebellious son because what he identified himself with our Rebellion he took our sin upon him oh praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight I know I have carried your mind in thousand different ways tonight praise the Lord but the Lord is good he's very good brother Branham said in position of position in Christ he said the return of the prodigal son is a beautiful picture give a beautiful picture of a seed now in the spiritual sense after we are born into Christ we become children of God and then see God Knows Best now years where I say reverently disagree with the with the the lateran breadwings you think I'm I'm persecuting Church no my dear brothers no see now this boy after he got at a certain age he had to be adopted into the scene into that same family he was born into praise the Lord amen so what what is happening here what is the sense here is that the new birth is not your adoption praise the Lord amen your new the new birth is not your adoption right glory be to God Hallelujah and I'm going to stretch this a little bit because many times when the prodigal son is preached is preached in the sense that when we were Sinners we were practical we were not born yet we didn't know the father praise the Lord so you can be born again and be prodigal and become a prodigal son why because you have not come to yourself yet you have not identified you have not got your truth identification the only identification you have on you is a church message identification and with that religious identification you become stubborn and rebellious because you think you can read a Bible you think now you know the quotes so we have a bunch of stubborn people sitting under the message they can challenge preachers they can challenge the prophet yes this boy he never became practical in his mother womb he was born first glory be to God Hallelujah can we say praise the Lord tonight amen can we say praise the Lord tonight Hallelujah glory be to God glory be to God glory be to God and you say in the back of your mind brother one where you took this one from amen let's continue to read a little bit we will get to where we want to go tonight because I I realized that if I if I use this to lay the platform when I start talking on uh you know on Sunday I read a scripture that about uh where Moses said there's two chapters after this that he said uh uh Ambassador shall not enter into the congregation and and I was saying that you realize that there was our our sinful nature you know our first birth was between the serpent and Eve so that first birth was actually an illegitimate birth because we were supposed to come by the Sea incorruptible which is the word of God and that's why the spoken word has come to give us are we together so I thought that I should step back a little bit as you use the Practical son to be able to fish you and get you to the place where I can clean you up and then we all can bring a good meal to the father praise the Lord so brother Benham go ahead here he says here this boy after he got to a certain age he had to be adopted into that same family he was born into and a minister knows that the placing of a son he had to be adopted into the family that he was born into but keep making this emphasis the same family but before adoption he have to be born you don't give him you don't give him an inheritance it could be in the father's mind if I have a son I'm going to give him this car I'm going to give him this but you don't give it to him until he's born but then after he's born he have to be trained he have to be taught right he's not lenient to his own understanding but he's acknowledging God's word so brother bam says every minute son knows that the blessing of his son he had to be adopted into the family that he was born into could you imagine that but that's the Old Testament teaching praise the Lord so we can trace the prodigal son back to the Old Testament because actually the prodigal son was more about adoption it was more about adoption than salvation what was about salvation was a sheep that was lost the prodigal son was more about adoption the handling of inheritance more than are we together tonight praise the Lord you look like a quiet group tonight I hope you will have a good sleep I wish you a good sleep when you go home tonight praise the Lord brother Branham says in the message without money or Price He says some of you young people yeah that has wasted your life the hours that uh uh the hours their mother spending prayer for you and Dad all the teaching that has been done to you and yet you have turned it aside to listen to The Whisper Of The Devil I picked this one up tonight because uh I wanted us to be able to understand praise the Lord there are sometimes that some of the things where many of our young people that have the grace to be born in the the the surrounding of the message praise the Lord amen to be able to because if we don't understand if we if we don't come to the place to understand that it's us it's after we have come to a birth praise the Lord before we go through our prodigal experience you will think that you were never a prodigal son because your mother brought you to church when you were smart praise the Lord amen glory be to God Hallelujah are we together are you with me tonight oh yeah I know I'm kind of for I'm kind of a refereeing the the Pharaohs of your theologic the way you understood their story praise the Lord so brother Branham is saying yes some of our young people that have wasted your life ours that your parents spending prayer for you your mom and dad and all the teaching that you have got under the message but down in you there is a stubborn prodigal spirit praise the Lord down in you there is a spirit to repair praise the Lord and you still find your way to get in your own Peak pain you know your Peak pain praise the Lord your Peak pain is your nasty attitude your nasty thoughts and the nasty things you allow in your life even after sitting honor the word of God sit in honor the message of the hour stay fine to take this gift of life this gift and you still drag it into the pig pen don't think about your Sinner's life because you were not born yet you are not a prodigal son until you are born in this house born under this message praise the Lord I'm not preaching because I'm angry with you young people no I'm trying to identify something because the Bible says when the prodigal came to himself when he came to himself when he came to himself that was when he identified his truth identity praise the Lord trying and struggling on the peer pressure I don't want to be like your friends and want to behave like your friend you you are in church you are singing Hallelujah then whatever you are doing you are still a prodigal struggling crisis here we have an identity crisis around the message praise the Lord this word has come to bring us to the place where we can be Sons and Daughters of God standing on our feet where you can face your mind battles the battle in your mind not covering it with church no when nobody around you can stand on your ground and say set on you are a liar you will never get me to do this that's what I'm talking about tonight and it's in you it's in you to do it it's in you to do it you don't need a preacher following you with touch light I don't need to love for you on Facebook I don't have Snapchat to look for you it's in you all you need to do is wake up wake up praise the Lord is in us to be better hospital to our wives it's in us to be better wives to our husbands it's in us to be better parents to our children what are we talking about praise the Lord oh because we are not in a word we come to church we're in a message so I'm not a prodigal son you know you still have a prodigal you're sinful nature it's a prodigal nature you love the Lord tonight oh let's give the Lord a hint of praise and may the Lord Jesus be good he's wonderful to be praised praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I feel good tonight Hallelujah says all the teaching that has been done to you and yet you have turned aside to listen to The Whisper of the devil and now you desire the music of the word not just because they call God name in it it's a good music praise the Lord young people now because they call God name in it he says I'm listening to gospel rap what is that what is gospel rap praise the Lord it is just that practical nature that love eating on the things of the word praise the Lord they just they just wrap it in the cover and wrote on a God is good but the taste is of the devil and Satan is using there to influence your soul what he's doing he's building rebellion in you oh praise the Lord all you need all you and preacher that will come to preach talking about something completely different completely different praise the Lord and then you would just pick up something and you think that it supports your rebellious spirit praise the Lord and pray this on before you realize your dress course start changing praise the Lord and all you say oh yeah the Pastor said the last time praise the Lord Jesus said my sheep we hear my voice sometimes I feel like I'm the pastor to this church but yet I'm not pastoring everybody what are you believing on that is the truth praise the Lord because it's not when you come to church I'm your pastor for you to be able to understand for me to be able to lead you you have to understand where I'm going praise the Lord you have to understand where I'm going you can sit down right here and you have your pastor wherever you want to have him and you know we love to have you we love to have you we enjoy having you but may God give us Grace to be able to identify that rebellious spirit that it will not influence this place we want to stay with the word brother Branham says that that what is my time nine or three oh my God oh man oh man 903 903 well bam said you turn aside and listen to the devil whisper and now you are Desiring the music of this word in the things of the word and you are coming to yourself you are coming you are coming to yourself when you realize that you don't have the right to dress the way you want all right not because you work for money you don't have the right to address the way you want to you don't have the right you just don't have the right because you wake up in the morning to do whatever you want to do with your life unless you come to that realization you have not wake up yet Until you realize that it takes this word to wash us with either watching of the word you are not claim that it takes this word to address us without the dressing of the word you are still naked I don't care how much you pay for your clothes and where you bought it from I'm not angry with you I'm dealing with a spirit don't think I'm angry with you young people I'm not angry with you dealing with a spirit glory be to God so feel free to shake my hand after the service and say God bless you I'm not angry with you don't think I'm angry with you no it's a spirit that I'm dealing with because that Spirit don't belong here amen it don't belong in your homes either praise the Lord hey don't belong in your homes yeah because it don't belong in your life our natural birth Rob us of our true identity and until we wake up we will struggle we will struggle because we want to be like this one we want to be like that one we want to be like this one we will struggle it does not mean that you don't love God you love God that young man loved his father but he was struggling he was struggling with with a with an inborn tendency that comes from our natural birth we struggle to pray we struggled to read we even struggle to be in church praise the Lord we struggle to be in church the desire is there it's in you because in you it's a true identity of a son let me read something here that are close you can get through everything tonight it's not ordained for that but we'll talk about a story here in spiritual I mean this year a French sodium now uh so he he talks about this story he says uh uh uh a little story here and he's he's even falling right into our time I didn't know that is uh I didn't know it was even that late so it's late so we write in the court tonight praise the Lord I did not intentionally apologia to be late I just realized forgive me and I have got about 10 pages no I don't have 10 pages I will admit to you I don't have 10 pages so I'm not the same with brother Brandon his French soldier returning back from the wall let me just paraphrase here and then I will read the last portion to you so the prophet of God said to God to a place and uh the driver of the Church of the truck wanted the soldiers to get down and stretch their legs praise the Lord they got down from the truck and brother Branham said this young Soldier just moved from among his frames and he started walking taking the path they wanted to stop him and the command and said no leave him and he started going he started going and this is a place where it was not very common to them are we together so uh Birdman says here so they watch him that will be the next set of under the same there so the watch the young fellow he got out and began to look around uh the water tank look all around over the hills he rubbed his face and said it and he looked again and he's seeing the water tank like the water tower up there something like that he looked all around at the station and he started walking instead of the Gods stopping him he followed him he went up over the hill and down a little path and then he turned right he went up over another Hill and come and come to a a little long coming he looked coming out out on the porch was an old man with a cane in his hands coming out throw his arm around him and said my son I know you will return they told me you were there but I know you will return and the boy come to himself his Armin is here left him he could identify who he was praise the Lord so there was there was something even though his mind was messed up but there was an instant in him that was guided him praise the Lord amen because there was a blood of his father that was speaking the father knew his son was alive and he would come home even though his mind was messed up from all the blasts of the word the blast of loud music the blast of all the craziness around but in him like is in every one of us here is that instinct that constantly bring you to church even though we had our struggle we have our mistakes but when that time of service reach you pick up your Bible it says I'm going to church praise the Lord even though you don't want to be but yet you come sometimes you say that no I won't go to church this Wednesday I will pick up an hour to work you're trying to find you try to build your own excuse by the father desire for you make you to change your mind okay I'll just go I will go I will go let me wear my clothes on I will go he could identify who he was he knew that was his father his spiritual how many Sia left him praise the Lord Abraham says all soldier of the cross there has been shocked with so many training so many denomination Crees and the things of this word have just messed us up praise the Lord the best that we can give is to become a church member Lord don't help us praise the Lord the best that we can give is to become a church member well yes we sit down in the very same church keep our body in and send our spirit to shopping all over the place where we're supposed to be enjoying the presence of God I mean singing those sounds are beautiful you are you are the Lover of My Soul it must be affecting us it's not just on the words we must be into the music because it's our life we must be into the word when a court is put up there I'm not just only listening for you to read to me I will be reading myself I will be placing myself into those quotes you are in for the service you are into the word it interests you you are interesting you are not just struggling and watching for the time and so for you to go no you are into the service praise the Lord are we together oh soldier of the cross been shocked by denomination created things of the word why don't you just step off for a few minutes and go looking around at the Bible I wandered around you might wander around in a sense that you will read things that you don't understand Don't Force Don't force yourself to interpret just enjoy reading the Bible it's going to come to life praise the Lord amen don't don't fall don't behave as if to say you're writing a sermon I want to know what this word means because the devil will just stalk you and he will take the desire and you will ask I'm not understanding what I'm reading why should I read it right just read it because you believe that it's God's word and you say God speak to me just read it enjoy it find a way to make God's word enjoyable to you praise the Lord I like doing audio reading at home and uh because of the of the case I like I like dramatized reading as King James but it's dramatized I enjoyed it when I'm driving I enjoy it because they bring drama so it creates an image in my mind you have to enjoy this word it's not just the word of God this is God in printed form why don't you just step aside a few minutes go looking around at your Bible you might wander around and you might find yourself identify you in the word as a believer pretty soon you will realize that the word will start calling your name you will start seeing yourself as a Believer why because it's in you it's in you that predestinator seed before the foundation of the word it's in you the church did not give it to you in you praise the Lord but the more you stay in the word the more you listen to the prophet message a person you realize you start falling in love with it praise the Lord I love it you read it you listen there are places where you will get lost don't worry about it just continue listening praise the Lord just continue listening he might talk about a story that will capture your mind something the world will say something you will read and it will call you call the day you come to yourself your life will never be the same musicians you can come
