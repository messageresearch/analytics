[37:15] he says uh he needed to be in church. So
[37:18] he was trying to make sure he map out
[37:20] the area and know that he can be in
[37:23] church on Sunday. So we are glad to have
[37:25] you and uh uh we we will pray then and
[37:30] find an opportunity to have you to come
[37:32] and greet the church and uh so it's just
[37:36] good to good to see uh the love of God
[37:39] stay in the hearts of people. Amen.
[37:42] Praise the Lord. The love of God stay in
[37:44] the hearts of his uh of his
[37:47] children. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[37:50] Lord.
[37:55] This morning I want to take uh I want to
[37:58] take a
[37:59] subject that
[38:04] uh you know is one of those things it
[38:07] comes out of the word of God and it just
[38:10] uh it just it hits you and you say wow.
[38:13] I mean uh uh you know uh the weekend we
[38:17] had brother uh Joseph Chakosi from the
[38:21] UK. He preached out Saturday night and
[38:25] Sunday and uh he was talking about
[38:28] Christ and and talking about the
[38:32] Messiah and uh uh I think on that we
[38:36] said that Sunday if I can remember we
[38:39] sank a chorus Messiah is the King of
[38:41] Kings. That's I think if I remember
[38:44] maybe that could be the first time we
[38:46] sank it here but that is a that's a old
[38:49] song uh uh we we used to sing back
[38:53] home and uh that stuck on my
[38:56] mind but then when he was going through
[39:00] the Christ series talking about the
[39:03] Messiah the anointed one in Christ and
[39:05] all of that after that I I was just kind
[39:09] of meditating on something and I decided
[39:11] to go back
[39:13] and look at uh uh the subject on
[39:17] Miah. And what stood out to me that I
[39:19] want to bring to you this morning is
[39:21] that
[39:23] uh the
[39:24] Messiah was was a title that was used by
[39:29] Daniel. Daniel used it twice and is also
[39:33] used twice in the New
[39:36] Testament. And uh uh and the two times
[39:40] it was used, one in uh uh uh St. John
[39:45] chapter 1 at the beginning of Jesus
[39:47] ministry and the second time it was used
[39:50] is in St. John chapter 4 when he met the
[39:53] woman at the word. And what uh is very
[39:57] interesting as we were looking to it
[39:59] this morning is
[40:01] that it's a is a it's a title. is a is
[40:06] an attribute of God that that relates to
[40:10] us a whole
[40:12] lot and is is is very important. I pray
[40:16] that the Lord will be able to to help us
[40:19] to be able to bring it to you. Let's
[40:21] just stand on our feet and then uh we
[40:24] sing a chorus here while we uh before we

[44:46] Naomi, Sister Joy, Brother
[44:49] Desim. Thank you for making music for us
[44:51] this morning. Amen. Praise the
[44:55] Lord. Amen. While we stand to our feet,
[44:58] we turn to Daniel chapter
[45:00] 9. Daniel chapter 9.
[45:04] just to give us a little history
[45:06] here and uh that
[45:10] uh we need
[45:12] to pay attention to and
[45:15] appreciate. We know that Daniel was down
[45:18] in captivity in
[45:20] Babylon. But then God started dealing
[45:23] with him while he was in Babylon. And
[45:26] much of what God will be dealing with
[45:28] Daniel will be concerning us the
[45:31] Gentiles.
[45:33] portion of it will be uh uh
[45:37] uh concerning the 70th week of the Jews,
[45:41] their their redemption and all of that.
[45:44] But
[45:45] uh
[45:50] uh there's a portion there that
[45:55] uh that speaks about the Gentiles. You
[45:58] see uh
[46:00] Daniel prophecy is so deep and is is
[46:06] uh is placed craftily in the word that
[46:10] you see between the book of
[46:13] Malachi and Matthew there's a period of
[46:16] time where theologians call the solemn
[46:19] years it looks like nothing is recorded
[46:23] between the time of Malachi and Daniel I
[46:27] mean Malachi in
[46:29] Matthew. But you will realize when you
[46:32] study the book of Daniel, you will find
[46:35] out that Daniel prophesied of what will
[46:38] happen between
[46:40] Malachi before the Messiah is
[46:43] born. Praise the Lord. Amen. That is
[46:47] just how rich the book of Da is. And uh
[46:53] uh hello Olivia.
[46:56] You're feeling much better. You have
[46:59] grown taller than your
[47:02] mother.
[47:04] Amen. Praise the
[47:09] Lord. Let's read Daniel chapter 9 verse
[47:13] 20. We will not go into that prophecy. I
[47:17] I just want to to to show you a little
[47:21] bit
[47:26] Praise the
[47:28] Lord. And I I I just I can't I can't
[47:33] help but
[47:34] uh let's let's just read what I want us
[47:38] to read this morning. And you you have
[47:39] your seat and I will go back to to
[47:42] everything I want to share with you this
[47:44] morning. Let's read Daniel chapter nine.
[47:47] Let's read from verse 19. Oh Lord, year
[47:50] Oh Lord, forgive. Oh Lord, yaking and
[47:53] do. Praise the Lord. What a
[47:57] prayer. Oh Lord, year. Oh Lord,
[48:01] forgive. Oh Lord, he can endure.
[48:05] Deferred not for for thine own sake. Oh
[48:09] my God, for thy city and and the and thy
[48:14] people I called by thy name. the city of
[48:18] Jerusalem and the people I called by his
[48:22] name. And while I was speaking and
[48:25] praying and confessing my sin and the
[48:29] sin of my people Israel and presenting
[48:33] my
[48:35] supplication before the
[48:38] Lord my God for the holy mountains of my
[48:42] God. Yeah. While I was speaking in
[48:45] prayer, even the man
[48:49] Gabriel whom I had seen in vision at the
[48:54] beginning being caused to fly sweatly,
[48:57] touch me about the time of the evening
[49:02] oblation. And he informed
[49:05] me. Praise the Lord.
[49:14] Okay. Okay. Let's let's continue to
[49:15] read. Oh, I I see what happened
[49:19] here. Okay. And he informed me and talk
[49:22] with me and said, "Oh,
[49:24] Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee
[49:29] skills and
[49:31] understanding." Praise the Lord. I mean,
[49:34] we really need it. Amen. To serve God,
[49:38] you need skills and understanding to be
[49:41] able to deal with uh uh uh the devil and
[49:45] you need to know his tricks. You need to
[49:48] understand skills and uh I mean you need
[49:52] to get skills and understanding. Skills
[49:54] is good for war. I was actually going to
[49:57] uh uh speak on this morning where David
[50:00] said he taught my hands to war. That's
[50:02] what I was studying during the week. But
[50:04] then I felt like I can talk on this
[50:07] because uh what we want to talk about is
[50:09] more about uh spiritual warfare than
[50:13] when we get to teach my hands forward.
[50:15] It will make more sense. So I am come
[50:18] forth to give these skills and
[50:21] understanding. Praise the Lord. The Lord
[50:24] bless you. You can have your seat while
[50:25] we continue to read. I realize it's a
[50:27] long reading. Let me do the standing.
[50:29] Amen.
[50:31] while you take the comfort of your seat.
[50:33] At the beginning of thy
[50:39] supplication, the commandment came
[50:42] forth, and I am come to show
[50:47] thee, for thou I greatly
[50:51] beloved, and therefore understand the
[50:53] matter, and consider the vision. Praise
[50:58] the Lord.
[51:00] Amen. If you read the book of of of
[51:03] Daniel, you will see there are a lot of
[51:05] similarities with the book of
[51:07] Revelation. Okay, Daniel had all of
[51:10] these creatures uh uh you know with
[51:13] different faces and I mean a lot of
[51:15] similarity with the book of Revelation.
[51:18] You see that uh uh God was detailing a
[51:23] whole lot of things uh for
[51:26] us. Uh praise the Lord. Is that sister
[51:30] miracle behind you? God bless you. Good
[51:33] to see you.
[51:36] Amen. I think I need to keep my glasses
[51:43] on. So let's read that in verse 24.
[51:48] 70 week are determined upon thy people
[51:51] and upon the holy city to finish the
[51:53] transgression and to make an an an end
[51:57] of sin and to make reconciliation for
[52:00] the iniquity and to bring and to bring
[52:03] in everlasting righteousness to seal up
[52:05] the vision and uh and prophecy to anoint
[52:10] the most holy. Now uh uh this this is
[52:15] about the 70th week but let me put
[52:17] something in context here so you will be
[52:19] able to see it and appreciate it because
[52:22] Daniel was in
[52:24] captivity and
[52:27] Malachi is an exile prophet one of the
[52:31] prophet after
[52:33] captivity. Praise the Lord. So when
[52:36] Malachi came on the scene, uh uh uh he
[52:41] started trying to to uh engage Israel
[52:46] and show them that it was God's
[52:50] love for for the way that God took them
[52:53] into captivity. It was an expression of
[52:56] God's love. Then he said, "You may say
[52:59] back to me, how is that the love of
[53:02] God?" Amen.
[53:04] Okay. Now, look at it like this. Israel
[53:09] despised the
[53:11] Sabbath. For many years, they never
[53:14] regarded the Sabbath. So, God was going
[53:17] to claim his Sabbath. He was going to
[53:20] claim a time for the land to rest
[53:23] because he told them in the book of uh
[53:26] of uh uh uh Exodus and and and and
[53:29] Leviticus that uh after seven years the
[53:32] land should rest. You must give the land
[53:35] rest. You must give yourself
[53:38] rest. Praise the Lord. Because rest is a
[53:42] very important ingredient of the
[53:44] Christian faith. That's the reason why
[53:47] the Holy Ghost is a type of
[53:50] rest. Praise the Lord. And because the
[53:54] people despise the rest of God, they
[53:57] despise the Sabbath of God, God was
[54:00] going to claim it anyhow. And I tell
[54:03] you, if you despise the rest of God, the
[54:06] rest of your body, God will claim it.
[54:08] One of the way to claim it is to call
[54:10] you
[54:12] home because you are abusing your
[54:17] body. Are we together? When God made the
[54:21] the the entire word in the beginning,
[54:24] the Bible says the Lord
[54:28] rested. He
[54:30] rested. And when he called Israel
[54:33] together, he told them, "Hallow the
[54:36] seventh day for
[54:41] rest." Praise the Lord. Are we
[54:45] together? So God was going to claim the
[54:48] rest from his people whether they like
[54:50] it or not. I will send you in captivity.
[54:53] The land is going to rest. And when the
[54:56] land have its rest, I will bring you
[54:58] back.
[55:02] Are we together? Amen. God means just
[55:06] what he says and he says what he means.
[55:14] Are we together? So here is here is the
[55:16] context there now. So, Malachi is here
[55:20] because I'm trying to show you how you
[55:22] can see the rest the years that is
[55:26] called uh uh uh uh the the the empty
[55:29] years or I I don't know how to term it
[55:32] between Malachi and and uh uh Matthew
[55:36] for you to be able to see it because
[55:38] yeah, he's prophesied of things that are
[55:41] going to happen even before the Messiah
[55:44] comes.
[55:48] Are we
[55:52] together? Verse 25. Know therefore and
[55:56] understand that from the going forth of
[55:58] the commandment to restore and build
[56:02] Jerusalem. When was that? The going
[56:05] forth of the commandment. From the time
[56:06] of Caesar, from the time of Neimas and
[56:10] and and Ezra. That was the going forth
[56:13] of the commandment.
[56:15] for them to build the walls, for them to
[56:18] build the the the the
[56:21] temple. So Daniel prophecy cover all of
[56:25] that period of time to the coming of the
[56:29] Messiah. So there is no wasted years,
[56:32] there is no vain years, there is no
[56:34] blank years. God is busy.
[56:40] Are we
[56:42] together? No. careful and understand
[56:46] that from the going forth of the
[56:49] commandment to
[56:52] restore and to build Jerusalem
[56:56] unto the Messiah the
[57:02] prince shall
[57:04] be seven weeks. These are weeks of years
[57:09] now weeks of weeks.
[57:12] weeks of years. Are we
[57:18] together? The street shall be built
[57:21] again and the walls even in troublesome
[57:26] time. And after three scrolls and two
[57:29] weeks shall Messiah be cut off. but not
[57:33] for
[57:34] himself and the people of the
[57:39] prince that shall
[57:41] come shall destroy the city and the
[57:44] sanctuary that up to the time of Titus
[57:47] the destruction of Jerusalem and the end
[57:50] thereof shall be with a flood and unto
[57:54] the end of the world uh desolation are
[57:58] determined. Now, what we want to talk
[58:00] about this morning, not prophecy, I just
[58:03] want to pick up something that interests
[58:06] me. Messiah the prince. I want to talk
[58:10] on
[58:11] Messiah the
[58:14] prince. That's the first time that title
[58:17] of God was used. That's the first time
[58:21] that title of Jesus Christ was used.
[58:25] So when you read the prophecy year from
[58:28] the building
[58:30] uh of Jerusalem onto Maiah the
[58:35] prince, you know definitely when he's
[58:38] talking about Miah the prince, he's
[58:41] talking about the coming of Jesus. Amen.
[58:44] Are we together? Do you agree with me?
[58:47] Praise the Lord.
[58:49] Amen. If you don't agree, just hold
[58:51] tight.
[58:55] And uh so when he comes down again to
[58:59] verse 26 and say after three scrolls in
[59:02] two weeks shall Maziah be cut off. That
[59:05] is the death of the Lord Jesus. He will
[59:09] be cut off but not for
[59:11] himself. And he says and the people of
[59:14] the prince. Then he used the word again
[59:17] the people of the prince. Are we
[59:20] together? Amen. So that's what we want
[59:24] to look at this morning. We want to look
[59:26] at Maiah the prince. What a
[59:32] title is just like we s talk about Jesus
[59:36] the bread of life, the great physician,
[59:39] the shepherd. That's all his
[59:42] titles. Amen. Messiah the prince was
[59:47] another title. But this title has a very
[59:51] significance to you and myself. And
[59:54] that's what I want us to pay attention
[59:57] to. That's what I want us to d uh uh
[1:00:00] into this morning and just feist on.
[1:00:03] Amen. And just feist on. I'm I'm just so
[1:00:06] happy to talk about this because
[1:00:11] studying this I realized that if you
[1:00:15] understand the the important you see
[1:00:18] it's almost like the seven redemptive
[1:00:20] name that God gave Israel Jehovah Jara
[1:00:24] Jehovah Rafa Jehovah it was God telling
[1:00:28] his people that I will meet you at every
[1:00:32] point of your
[1:00:33] need. Amen. Remember now when God when
[1:00:38] Abraham called him Jehovah Gyarra on the
[1:00:42] mountain what did he said? He said the
[1:00:45] Lord will
[1:00:47] provide for you. Is that what he said?
[1:00:50] No. No. The Lord will provide for
[1:00:54] himself. So you have to think about
[1:00:57] God's
[1:00:58] provision. It's not for you. It's for
[1:01:01] himself. It is God meeting your need
[1:01:07] that pleases
[1:01:11] him. God is providing for
[1:01:16] himself. Amen.
[1:01:18] So, it's now all about our needs and
[1:01:22] wants because he placed us here for his
[1:01:25] glory and he's going to give us the
[1:01:28] portion that we need for every step of
[1:01:31] our journey.
[1:01:36] So, it's better to tell the Lord, Lord,
[1:01:38] provide for yourself in my need.
[1:01:43] Lord, I'm sick. Provide for yourself in
[1:01:46] my in my sickness.
[1:01:50] Because the moment you begin to
[1:01:52] understand that it's not about you, it's
[1:01:54] about him, the better it gets,
[1:01:59] you learn to wait on the Lord.
[1:02:04] Because he's providing for himself, not
[1:02:07] for
[1:02:08] you. Are we together? You love the Lord.
[1:02:12] Amen. So that is the same way with with
[1:02:16] all of his attributes. Now we're going
[1:02:18] to look at another attribute here that
[1:02:21] is that is that is very very we've been
[1:02:23] talking about the word made flesh and
[1:02:26] this just comes right in there that uh
[1:02:30] we will appreciate as we look at it.
[1:02:32] Amen.
[1:02:34] Now when you look at this word maziah
[1:02:37] the
[1:02:38] prince in the Hebrew is called
[1:02:43] maziah ni the word prince mean
[1:02:48] ni I've heard that over and over there
[1:02:51] this uh there's
[1:02:54] uh this
[1:02:55] uh
[1:02:58] uh there's a rabbi that I listen to. He
[1:03:00] used that over and over and uh I I I I
[1:03:04] love the sound of it but just studying
[1:03:08] this subject just make me to love him
[1:03:12] more.
[1:03:15] Amen.
[1:03:19] Because the word nid actually means
[1:03:23] prince but it says is the prince of the
[1:03:26] Gentiles.
[1:03:30] Then my head. Praise the Lord. I mean,
[1:03:33] it's been my head. I'm telling you. I'm
[1:03:36] telling
[1:03:37] you. Praise the
[1:03:40] Lord. Is being my
[1:03:44] head. Messiah. It is
[1:03:47] Jesus. That tied to
[1:03:50] Messiah is in respect to
[1:03:53] Israel. Amen. They are waiting for their
[1:03:57] Miah. is in respect to
[1:04:01] Israel. But the
[1:04:04] prince, the
[1:04:07] prince brings us the Gentiles brings the
[1:04:11] rest of God uh uh redemptive people into
[1:04:18] view. Are we together?
[1:04:25] So the word
[1:04:31] prince also shows his
[1:04:36] power.
[1:04:38] Amen. Shows his
[1:04:40] power.
[1:04:42] Messiah
[1:04:44] is the Christ. Is that right? We're
[1:04:48] going to see it in in St. John. Messiah
[1:04:52] is the
[1:04:54] Christ. The prince part of
[1:04:57] it is the power, the
[1:05:01] authority. That's what make Christ is
[1:05:04] the anointed word. Christ is the
[1:05:07] anointed
[1:05:09] one. Not just anointed because it's
[1:05:13] sacred, but there is a power behind it.
[1:05:18] Are we together? So what I'm trying to
[1:05:21] bring to us this morning is to
[1:05:24] appreciate the power that is behind the
[1:05:30] word. Amen. The power that is behind the
[1:05:35] word. Take a scripture with me. Psalm
[1:05:40] chapter
[1:05:41] 138. Psalm chapter
[1:05:45] 138. Let's go this morning. I'm fired
[1:05:47] up. Amen.
[1:05:52] Amen. I'm fire up. Praise the
[1:05:56] Lord. I woke up this morning after
[1:05:59] studying and praying. I went back to
[1:06:01] sleep. I was preaching this message in
[1:06:03] my sleep. I said, "My goodness me, I'm
[1:06:05] just at the right place." Amen.
[1:06:08] I'm So I'm fired up.
[1:06:12] Amen. I started becoming so tired and
[1:06:14] sleepy. So I got to get a cup of coffee.
[1:06:17] I told you I got to wake myself up, get
[1:06:20] a cup of coffee and get myself there.
[1:06:22] Let's read Psalm chapter Psalm chapter
[1:06:26] 138 verse
[1:06:28] two. Listen to what David said here. I
[1:06:31] will worship towards thy holy temple and
[1:06:34] praise thy name for thy loving kindness
[1:06:39] and for thy truth. And he
[1:06:43] said, "For thou have magnified thy word
[1:06:49] above thy
[1:06:52] name." The word is magnified above the
[1:06:57] name of
[1:06:58] God. Now you see that is the reason why
[1:07:02] the Christian church is is filling all
[1:07:05] the time. We want to rebuke the devil in
[1:07:08] the name of Jesus
[1:07:09] Christ. Amen.
[1:07:12] But we not magnifying the
[1:07:17] word. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:20] Amen. We want to live in disobedience to
[1:07:23] God's word yet we want the power of his
[1:07:26] name. It does not work like
[1:07:29] that. God don't operate like
[1:07:32] that. He have exalted his
[1:07:36] word above his name.
[1:07:40] That shows the
[1:07:43] importance of God's
[1:07:47] word. Praise the Lord. He said, "He that
[1:07:51] love me will call my name." Is that what
[1:07:54] the Bible says? No. He that love me will
[1:07:57] keep my
[1:07:58] commandments. Is that his
[1:08:04] word? Praise the
[1:08:06] Lord. He has magnified his word. above
[1:08:10] his
[1:08:12] name. Are we
[1:08:19] together? So we see here that
[1:08:22] Messiah is his calling. He's called to
[1:08:25] be the
[1:08:26] Christ and uh uh uh the prince. is
[1:08:30] his power. So he is the anointed
[1:08:34] leader. He is the anointed one. Are we
[1:08:39] together? Now let's look at Christ in
[1:08:41] the New Testament. There only two times
[1:08:45] Maiah, sorry. Only two times Messiah was
[1:08:47] used in the New Testament is in the book
[1:08:50] of St. John. Let's look at that. St.
[1:08:52] John chapter
[1:08:55] 1. St. John chapter one.
[1:08:59] And if you even look at it, you will see
[1:09:01] that the spelling is a little bit
[1:09:02] different because the Old Testament held
[1:09:05] the Hebrew and the New Testament took
[1:09:07] the
[1:09:08] Greek. So the spellings are a little bit
[1:09:11] different. But that's that does not uh
[1:09:14] uh it does not uh confuse us. I mean we
[1:09:18] are right there. We know what we're
[1:09:19] talking about. We know who we talking
[1:09:22] about. Amen. So St. John chapter one.
[1:09:25] There's there is another thing I want to
[1:09:27] show you yet. It's in John chapter one.
[1:09:30] Uh let's let's look at verse uh 35. It's
[1:09:34] in John chapter 1 verse
[1:09:37] 35 just before we come
[1:09:40] down
[1:09:42] to the
[1:09:44] Messiah and
[1:09:46] not.
[1:09:49] Amen. Look at this. I saw this uh
[1:09:53] reading the word and it kind of a
[1:09:55] blessed me. I love to share what blessed
[1:09:57] me. Amen. Let's share the blessing.
[1:09:59] Let's pass it around. Amen. Amen. Verse
[1:10:02] 35. Again, the next day after John
[1:10:06] stood and two of his
[1:10:09] disciples and looking upon Jesus as he
[1:10:12] walked, he said, "Behold the lamb of
[1:10:15] God." That's uh River Jordan experience.
[1:10:18] And the two disciples heard him speak,
[1:10:20] and they followed Jesus. Then Jesus
[1:10:23] turned and saw them following, and said
[1:10:25] unto them, "What seek
[1:10:29] ye?" They said unto him, "Rabba, which
[1:10:33] is to say, being interpreted,
[1:10:36] Master, where dwelleth
[1:10:39] thou?" He said unto them, "Come and
[1:10:42] see." They came and saw where he dwed
[1:10:45] and they bowed with him that day. For it
[1:10:48] was about the 10th
[1:10:50] hour. One of the two which heard Jesus
[1:10:54] speak and follow him was Andrew. Now
[1:10:58] this is what this is what caught my
[1:10:59] attention. This is off subject, but I I
[1:11:01] love it. I love off subject. Amen.
[1:11:04] Because you get down the road and and
[1:11:06] then you just going through all the
[1:11:08] trails. Amen. I love it. What caught my
[1:11:11] mind is this. Look at this now. This is
[1:11:13] the beginning of his
[1:11:16] ministry. And here is it. He has two men
[1:11:20] that are following him. Think about the
[1:11:23] role of
[1:11:24] Emas. That was the end of his
[1:11:27] ministry. Okay. At the beginning of his
[1:11:30] ministry, these are two men, two of John
[1:11:34] disciples that that were attracted to
[1:11:36] his ministry and they are following him.
[1:11:39] And what is beautiful here is that the
[1:11:42] scripture only gave us one person name
[1:11:45] and never told us who was the
[1:11:50] second. Praise the Lord. You see that's
[1:11:53] the reason why the Jews they look at the
[1:11:56] word of God as a
[1:11:58] pattern. You can see pattern in the
[1:12:01] word because it's designed by
[1:12:06] God. Amen. is designed by
[1:12:10] God. See how unique it is. It's not only
[1:12:14] a star that is peculiar to John, but
[1:12:17] Luke did the same thing. At the end of
[1:12:20] Jesus ministry, he tell us of two men
[1:12:23] that I met on the role of Emas and the
[1:12:25] Holy Ghost take one person name. Nowhere
[1:12:29] in scripture you will find the second
[1:12:31] person name. History history said do not
[1:12:34] give it. you search uh biblical history,
[1:12:38] it's hard to find who is this second
[1:12:40] person. And the same thing yet in the
[1:12:42] beginning of Jesus ministry, two of the
[1:12:45] disciples. I I I'm sure Andrew knew who
[1:12:49] was the second person. But there is
[1:12:51] nowhere in the scripture he said it was
[1:12:53] me and this person that that went after
[1:12:57] Jesus. is beautiful
[1:13:00] because it's a design by
[1:13:05] God there that that that there are
[1:13:09] people there are his
[1:13:12] elect. There are people that are doing
[1:13:16] the work of God. There are people that
[1:13:19] are laboring in the field and we might
[1:13:22] never know their
[1:13:25] name. is God's
[1:13:28] design. Right? In the book of
[1:13:30] Revelation, it comes out Paul uh uh
[1:13:34] Antipass, my faithful servant. You never
[1:13:37] see Antipass in the book of
[1:13:39] Acts. You never see Antipass in any of
[1:13:42] the record of of the gospel. But yet the
[1:13:46] Holy Ghost picked his name up to show
[1:13:50] that with all the men that was working,
[1:13:53] there was a man called
[1:13:56] Antipass. If he only had three person in
[1:13:59] his church, he was doing the work of
[1:14:01] God. If he never had a church and he was
[1:14:04] just on the street, he was doing the
[1:14:06] work of
[1:14:07] God. It's God's
[1:14:11] design. He designed it that way.
[1:14:15] that we don't need to know your name to
[1:14:17] call you
[1:14:19] brother. Praise the Lord. We don't need
[1:14:22] to know your name to call you
[1:14:24] brother. Praise the
[1:14:26] Lord. You know, you talk to some people
[1:14:29] you know about this. No, I never heard
[1:14:31] his name. And and and and it's it's just
[1:14:33] a kind of a snap. I never heard his
[1:14:35] name. He does not matter. I might not
[1:14:37] matter to you. I matter to God.
[1:14:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:46] Amen. I like to show them this scripture
[1:14:48] and say, "Do you know this guy that was
[1:14:50] walking with
[1:14:51] Andrews? Maybe he don't matter to
[1:14:55] him, but he was there before you and
[1:14:57] myself. He was the first one that got
[1:15:00] attracted to the ministry of Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ." Praise the Lord. Those those
[1:15:07] kind of a things do they just they just
[1:15:09] take my whole day because I just get
[1:15:11] lost in it. Amen. I just enjoy I just
[1:15:14] appreciate the design in the holy
[1:15:20] scriptures. Praise the Lord. If it was
[1:15:23] men that wrote this book, they will come
[1:15:25] back and edit it and put that person in
[1:15:27] it. But because it's God that designed
[1:15:30] it, nobody can edit it.
[1:15:35] Okay, let's get back to our subject. You
[1:15:37] love the Lord. Let's give the Lord a
[1:15:39] hand of praise. He's wanting to be
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:45] praised.
[1:15:47] Hallelujah. So don't don't don't fight
[1:15:49] for your name to be in the paper. Just
[1:15:52] do what you are called to do. Do it
[1:15:54] right. Do it
[1:15:58] faithfully. Let's get back to our
[1:16:00] scripture here.
[1:16:01] Okay. Okay. Now I'm ready to
[1:16:05] preach. Verse 40. One of the two which
[1:16:08] heard Jesus speak and follow him was
[1:16:12] Andrew Simon Peter
[1:16:14] brother. He find he uh he first find his
[1:16:18] own brother Simon and said unto him, we
[1:16:22] have found the
[1:16:24] Messiah which is being interpreted the
[1:16:28] Christ. Now pay attention to that
[1:16:32] because the second time Messiah will be
[1:16:35] used in the New Testament, it comes out
[1:16:37] with the sin
[1:16:40] definition. So the Jews knew that the
[1:16:43] Messiah was going to be Christ. The
[1:16:46] Messiah was going to be this prophet
[1:16:48] that Moses talked about. The Lord your
[1:16:51] God will raise up a prophet. They were
[1:16:54] they were believing that this prophet
[1:16:57] will be just like Moses. He will be like
[1:16:59] Moses. He will be a man even greater
[1:17:02] than Moses because they were believing
[1:17:04] that the Messiah, the uh uh uh uh uh the
[1:17:08] Jehovah of the Old Testament will come
[1:17:11] and embody in that
[1:17:14] man. That's what they were
[1:17:16] believing. So whenever they use Messiah,
[1:17:20] they make an emphasis. He will be the
[1:17:22] Christ. He will be the anointed
[1:17:25] one. Are we together? Amen. Now Andrew
[1:17:31] is identifying him as the
[1:17:35] Messiah. Why? How Andrew
[1:17:39] knew? Jesus have not done anything
[1:17:41] publicly yet.
[1:17:44] But Andrew is identifying him because
[1:17:48] his pastor John the Baptist told them
[1:17:51] and said, "Behold the lamb of God that
[1:17:54] takes away the sin of the word." Amen.
[1:17:58] And they believe their pastor message.
[1:18:00] They believe John message. And that's
[1:18:03] the reason why Andrew can say, "We have
[1:18:06] found the Messiah,
[1:18:08] the Christ." Praise the Lord. But watch
[1:18:11] now. Let's let's let's read a little
[1:18:13] bit. You love to read the Bible.
[1:18:17] Amen. Let's read uh uh the Messiah which
[1:18:20] is interpreted of Christ. Verse 42. And
[1:18:23] he brought him to Jesus. Andrew brought
[1:18:27] his brother Simon to Jesus. And when
[1:18:31] Jesus beheld him, he says, "Thou art
[1:18:34] Simon, son of Jonah, call his name, call
[1:18:38] his father's name." Amen.
[1:18:44] What is that
[1:18:46] discernment? He comes in the presence of
[1:18:48] of Jesus. Jesus called his name before
[1:18:51] any
[1:18:52] introduction. Says, "Thou are Simon. You
[1:18:55] are a son of
[1:18:56] Jonas." Are we together?
[1:19:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:03] Well, it could be easy for for Simon to
[1:19:07] think that, well, Andrew stole him my
[1:19:10] name, but just wait a little bit. Are we
[1:19:14] together? Just wait a little
[1:19:19] bit. Thou thou Simon, son of Jonah, thou
[1:19:23] shalt be called Tyas Cifas, which is but
[1:19:28] interpreted a stone. The day following
[1:19:30] Jesus will go forth to Galilee and find
[1:19:34] Philillip and he will say unto him,
[1:19:36] "Follow me." Now, now Philillip was of
[1:19:39] Bethia, the city of Andrews and Peter.
[1:19:42] And then Philillip went and found his
[1:19:44] friend uh uh uh Nata and said unto him,
[1:19:48] "We have found him of whom Moses,"
[1:19:51] that's that's Deuteronomy uh uh the uh
[1:19:54] 18 uh Moses in the Lord and the prophets
[1:19:58] did write. Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
[1:20:02] Joseph. And Nathaniel said unto him,
[1:20:05] "Can there can there any good thing come
[1:20:09] out of Nazareth?" Philip said unto him,
[1:20:11] "Come and see." Jesus saw Natania
[1:20:15] coming. And he said unto
[1:20:19] him, and said to him, "Behold, an
[1:20:22] Israelite in thee, in whom there is no
[1:20:24] God." Nataniel said unto him, "Whence
[1:20:27] knew thou me?
[1:20:29] Jesus said, Jesus answered and said unto
[1:20:33] him,
[1:20:35] before that Philip called thee, when
[1:20:38] thou were under the fig tree, I saw
[1:20:41] thee. Even before Philip called you, I
[1:20:43] saw you under the fig tree. Praise the
[1:20:46] Lord. I mean, that just it just blew
[1:20:49] Natana mind. Amen. He's he's telling me
[1:20:53] my address.
[1:20:56] He's telling me where I
[1:20:59] was. Praise the
[1:21:01] Lord. You know, I mean, uh, uh, some of
[1:21:04] some of you know the story. Brother
[1:21:05] Bangs Woo's brother, you know, they were
[1:21:07] all, uh, Jehovah witnesses, uh, uh, you
[1:21:11] know, Brother Brandon prayed for brother
[1:21:12] Bangs Woo's son that was that, you know,
[1:21:15] that was handicapped and he got healed.
[1:21:18] So, he's now became a believer. He went
[1:21:20] and told his brother and his brother you
[1:21:24] know was as I mean thanks you just you
[1:21:26] just for all sorts of things you know he
[1:21:28] was trying to witness to them and uh uh
[1:21:32] uh so when when his brother came to see
[1:21:36] brother Brham you know he brought he
[1:21:38] brought him to uh to brother Brandham
[1:21:41] and then brother Brham started to talk
[1:21:44] to
[1:21:45] him you know and then he felt in his
[1:21:48] heart that yeah okay my brother have
[1:21:50] told this man some things about me, you
[1:21:52] know. Then he told, he says, "Well, you
[1:21:54] think your brother told me, but I will
[1:21:57] tell you that you did the right thing to
[1:21:58] go through that window last night
[1:22:01] because you was you were sleeping with
[1:22:02] another man's wife and a man had a rifle
[1:22:05] and he was going to blow your head off."
[1:22:07] Tell me in a
[1:22:09] word. Praise the Lord. I mean, it was it
[1:22:13] was just enough for him to say, "I
[1:22:16] surround a God." Yeah. Really?
[1:22:19] Praise the Lord. Amen. It was enough for
[1:22:22] him to say, "I
[1:22:26] surrender." Because those kind of a
[1:22:29] things is not things that you go home to
[1:22:30] tell your
[1:22:32] brothers. It's a personal
[1:22:35] secret. You almost
[1:22:38] die because you are running with
[1:22:40] somebody's
[1:22:43] wife. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:47] Are we together? So what what are we
[1:22:50] trying to show here is the sign of the
[1:22:52] Messiah.
[1:22:54] Amen. The sign of the Messiah. Now what
[1:22:58] what I don't want us to do, I don't want
[1:23:00] us to leave it in
[1:23:02] history. I want us to make it present
[1:23:05] day. The sign of the Messiah is stay
[1:23:08] here. And what is that sign? Hebrew
[1:23:12] 4:12. The word of God is sharper than
[1:23:15] the two-edged sword. Discerning the
[1:23:19] intent. Amen. Praise the Lord. It
[1:23:23] stayed. That that is that is the ni.
[1:23:28] That is the power of the word that is in
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:32] church. Praise the Lord. Amen. That is
[1:23:36] the power of the word that the preacher
[1:23:39] can be able to preach and the Holy Ghost
[1:23:41] can be able to identify something in
[1:23:44] your life.
[1:23:47] Are we together?
[1:23:49] I don't want us to keep it in the
[1:23:51] history. We are only using the Bible to
[1:23:54] be able to identify that Jesus is the
[1:23:57] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:24:04] Are we together?
[1:24:07] Miah the
[1:24:10] prince. St. John chapter 4, the second
[1:24:13] time Maziah is used in the New
[1:24:18] Testament. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:29] Like if you look at the word Asian of
[1:24:31] day, it's another it's another attribute
[1:24:34] of God. And the only time is used in the
[1:24:36] Bible is in the book of
[1:24:40] Daniel because it's a it's it's a
[1:24:43] specific attribute of God that is tied
[1:24:46] to the
[1:24:49] Gentiles. Let's uh let's look at this.
[1:24:52] St. John chapter 4.
[1:24:56] St. John chapter 4, we read right here
[1:25:00] from verse 10. Jesus answered and said
[1:25:02] unto her, "If thou knew the gift of
[1:25:05] God," that's what I wanted to read from
[1:25:07] verse four. "If thou knew the gift of
[1:25:10] God," why? Because the Messiah is the
[1:25:13] gift of God. Amen. The anointed word is
[1:25:16] the gift of God. You don't go to
[1:25:18] theological school to get
[1:25:20] it. Amen. No. God reveal himself to you
[1:25:26] beyond all you can learn. God come
[1:25:29] personally and he open the word and show
[1:25:31] you this is me. Look
[1:25:36] here he says if
[1:25:38] thou knew the gift of God and who is it
[1:25:43] that said unto thee give me to
[1:25:46] drink thou would have asked of him and
[1:25:49] he who gave you living water. The woman
[1:25:52] said unto him, "Sir, that has nothing to
[1:25:55] draw away, and the well is deep, from uh
[1:25:58] from whence uh then thou have the living
[1:26:01] water, are thou greater than our father
[1:26:03] Jacob, which gave us this well, and
[1:26:06] drink thereof of himself, his children,
[1:26:08] and his scatters?" Jesus answered and
[1:26:10] said, "Whosoever drinkketh of the water
[1:26:15] uh whosoever drinkketh of this water
[1:26:17] shall thirst again, but whosoever
[1:26:19] drinkketh of the water that I shall give
[1:26:22] him shall never thirst. But the water
[1:26:25] that I shall give him shall be in him as
[1:26:28] a world of h water sprinking up into
[1:26:32] everlasting life." The woman said unto
[1:26:34] him, "Sir, give me this water that I
[1:26:37] thirst not neither come hither to draw."
[1:26:40] Jesus said, "Go and call your husband."
[1:26:42] The conversation start there. He was
[1:26:45] trying to get the woman attention.
[1:26:47] Contact her spirit. And yet this year
[1:26:49] the conversation, "Go call your husband
[1:26:51] and come here." The woman said, "I have
[1:26:53] no husband." And Jesus said, "Yeah, you
[1:26:56] have said the truth. Thou has well said,
[1:26:58] I have no husband, for thou has had five
[1:27:01] husband, and he whom thou now have is
[1:27:06] not thy husband. In that seth doubt
[1:27:11] truly as soon as he said
[1:27:14] that, now this is what I want you to
[1:27:17] see.
[1:27:20] the the ministry of the uh of the
[1:27:23] Messiah, the anointed word. The purpose
[1:27:26] of the anointed word is to attract the
[1:27:31] elect. Amen. Is to attract the illlet.
[1:27:35] Remember Jesus said, "Blessed is he that
[1:27:38] is not offended in me." The word is not
[1:27:41] sinful to offend you. The word might
[1:27:44] call you out. the word my blaster you
[1:27:46] rebuke you but the purpose of the word
[1:27:49] is to attract the elect.
[1:27:53] Amen. Because if the word start speaking
[1:27:56] things in my life, if the word is
[1:27:59] calling me up, then I know that uh God
[1:28:03] has a purpose for me.
[1:28:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:11] Are we together?
[1:28:13] So as soon as he said you have five
[1:28:15] husband, the one you're living with is
[1:28:17] not even your husband. It grabbed her
[1:28:20] attention. She knew that no this this is
[1:28:23] not just another Jewish boy. There is
[1:28:25] something about this man. He must be a
[1:28:29] prophet because he's not
[1:28:31] guessing. It's not a guessing game. He's
[1:28:34] straight on the
[1:28:37] point. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:41] The woman said, "Sir, I perceive that
[1:28:43] thou a prophet, you know, our father,
[1:28:46] she jump into thy religious spirit now
[1:28:49] and trying to identify herself as a
[1:28:51] worshipper. Our father uh uh worship in
[1:28:54] this mountain. But you said this in
[1:28:56] Jerusalem uh uh you know that that we
[1:28:59] should worship." Jesus said, "Woman,
[1:29:01] believe me, the hour cometh, neither uh
[1:29:04] uh when ye shall neither in this
[1:29:06] mountain none in Jerusalem worship the
[1:29:09] Father, ye worship you no net. For we
[1:29:13] worship, we know what we worship, for
[1:29:16] salvation is of the Jews. The hour
[1:29:18] cometh where the true worshipper will
[1:29:20] worship the Father in spirit and in
[1:29:22] truth. For such the Father seeketh. God
[1:29:25] is a spirit and they that worship him
[1:29:28] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[1:29:32] Amen. The woman knew
[1:29:34] that this is
[1:29:36] truth.
[1:29:38] Amen. This is truth. She's I mean she's
[1:29:42] she's so engaged
[1:29:44] now. Praise the Lord. She's so engaged.
[1:29:49] The difference that she saw you are a
[1:29:51] Jew, I'm a Samaritan. She have gone over
[1:29:55] that. Praise the Lord. She's not She's
[1:29:59] not interested in national spirit
[1:30:02] anymore. She's interested in a heavenly
[1:30:07] identity. Praise the
[1:30:11] Lord. The woman said unto him, I know
[1:30:15] that Maziah cometh, which is called
[1:30:20] Christ. When the Jews identify him as
[1:30:24] the Messiah, they call him the Christ.
[1:30:27] The Samaritan identify him as the
[1:30:29] Messiah, they knew that it was the
[1:30:32] Christ. What is the Christ? The anointed
[1:30:35] word.
[1:30:37] Are we together?
[1:30:40] The anointed word. Not just the
[1:30:44] entertaining word. The word that is
[1:30:46] anointed to change our life. The word
[1:30:50] that is anointed to rebuke spirits from
[1:30:53] us. The word that is anointed to bring
[1:30:56] healing, bring us peace of
[1:30:59] mind, settle our troubled
[1:31:02] spirit. Praise the Lord. Raise us up
[1:31:06] from all our
[1:31:08] abuses. That's the anointed
[1:31:15] word. I know that Messiah come and
[1:31:17] wishes called the
[1:31:20] Christ when he is come, he will tell us
[1:31:23] of these things. Praise the Lord. He
[1:31:26] will tell us of these
[1:31:29] things. And then when Jesus identify
[1:31:32] himself, I that speak unto thee am he,
[1:31:35] she had no more
[1:31:37] argument. There was no more argument.
[1:31:40] Praise the Lord. Amen. Why? Because when
[1:31:44] he talks about the Messiah, he was not
[1:31:47] centering the Messiah on the Jews. He
[1:31:50] says when when he cometh, it is not this
[1:31:53] mountain. It is not in Jerusalem. It is
[1:31:56] God's children wherever they are. Praise
[1:31:59] the Lord.
[1:32:01] God will be able to get in contact with
[1:32:03] his people. Praise the
[1:32:07] Lord. Amen.
[1:32:10] And then moreover, he went into my
[1:32:16] life to tell me my
[1:32:20] trouble. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:24] She identified him as the Messiah and
[1:32:27] and the Bible says and upon this you
[1:32:31] know she went into the Senate and
[1:32:34] said come and see the man they have told
[1:32:38] me all that I've done. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:43] One time she was hiding her past, but
[1:32:47] this time,
[1:32:49] Amen, she's glad that he told me all
[1:32:53] that I've
[1:32:55] done. Why? Because she found redemption.
[1:33:00] Amen. She's not ashamed of her past. Now
[1:33:03] she's using her past to bring people to
[1:33:06] the Messiah.
[1:33:11] Are we together?
[1:33:14] Messiah the
[1:33:18] prince is getting interested. Amen. I
[1:33:22] love
[1:33:23] it. I love it. I'm having a good time
[1:33:26] yet. Amen. If you don't know
[1:33:29] there, just watch my
[1:33:32] smile. You'll know that I'm having a
[1:33:34] good time. I'm loving it. Praise the
[1:33:37] Lord. I am loving it. Let's let's just
[1:33:40] read this quote here from he care. Do
[1:33:42] you
[1:33:45] care? I do a lot of Bible reading this
[1:33:48] morning and uh he care. Do you care? In
[1:33:50] the beginning was the word. Is that
[1:33:53] right? The word is
[1:33:55] God and the word was made flesh and dwed
[1:33:59] among us. And the Bible said in Hebrew
[1:34:05] 4 that the word is
[1:34:08] sharper
[1:34:10] than two edges swall a desenter of the
[1:34:14] thoughts of the heart. Is that right?
[1:34:18] And that was Jesus. And that's what
[1:34:21] Jesus did to prove he was the anointed
[1:34:26] word. He descended. He went deep into
[1:34:28] their life.
[1:34:31] You are Simon. Your father is
[1:34:37] Jonas. You said the
[1:34:39] truth because five husband is not your
[1:34:43] even the one you are living with. So he
[1:34:45] he peers into their life. And that is
[1:34:49] the same thing that the preaching of the
[1:34:51] gospel must do. That is the same thing
[1:34:53] that the reading of the word must do.
[1:34:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:01] Amen.
[1:35:05] The word is an anointed word. If you
[1:35:08] have the word and the anointing is not
[1:35:11] there, you don't have the
[1:35:13] nagi because the ni is the
[1:35:16] prince. Now, it's coming to be it's
[1:35:18] coming to be beautiful. Let's just
[1:35:20] finish this thought right
[1:35:22] here. And that's what Jesus did to prove
[1:35:26] he was the Messiah. He He was the
[1:35:29] anointed word. Messiah. Oh my. Don't you
[1:35:32] see that? What? What is Messiah? The
[1:35:35] anointed
[1:35:36] one. The anointed what? The anointed
[1:35:40] word. Praise the Lord. Amen. The
[1:35:44] anointed word. And the word was made
[1:35:47] flesh. He was the anointed word. You see
[1:35:51] that Bravville seed? He is the anointed
[1:35:55] word.
[1:35:57] And now when you commit yourself to him,
[1:36:01] then he use you beyond what you
[1:36:06] know, proving he still the anointed
[1:36:10] word. Praise the Lord. A descender of
[1:36:14] the thoughts of the heart when you
[1:36:16] commit yourself to him.
[1:36:20] Praise the Lord. He takes over your
[1:36:22] being. He gives you an
[1:36:25] ability more than you have. He gives you
[1:36:29] knowledge more than you
[1:36:32] know. Praise the Lord. He makes life
[1:36:36] interesting to live.
[1:36:39] You still have your struggles and
[1:36:41] trials, but life gets interesting to
[1:36:43] live. Why? Because you know the purpose
[1:36:46] why you are here. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:36:50] Amen. And you ready to stand for that
[1:36:52] purpose. You ready to fight for every
[1:36:54] inch of ground?
[1:36:58] Are we together? Christian life is not a
[1:37:01] boring life to you. It's an interesting
[1:37:03] life. Because every day interesting
[1:37:06] things happen. Praise the Lord. You can
[1:37:09] wake up right in the morning. You says,
[1:37:11] "Oh, devil, I see you. I see you. I see
[1:37:15] you. I'm not paying attention. I saw you
[1:37:18] right now. Amen. And people might think
[1:37:21] you're getting crazy, but life is
[1:37:23] interesting. Life become interesting.
[1:37:28] Oh my. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:37:30] praise. He's wanting to be
[1:37:33] praised.
[1:37:37] Hallelujah. People that think that
[1:37:39] Christian life is boring, they have not
[1:37:41] hit the new birth yet. Amen. When you
[1:37:44] hit the new birth, it gets interesting.
[1:37:47] Praise the Lord. It gets
[1:37:50] interesting. Hallelujah. That's the
[1:37:53] reason why as soon as you get baptized,
[1:37:55] all hell break loose because the devil
[1:37:57] know another child of God is on the
[1:37:59] earth. Amen. Another person to give us
[1:38:02] hard time is born. Praise the Lord. Oh,
[1:38:06] I love that. Amen. When you commit
[1:38:10] yourself to him, he takes you beyond
[1:38:12] your
[1:38:13] abilities. Are we together? Now let's
[1:38:16] pay attention to some things here that I
[1:38:18] want that where we where the rubber
[1:38:19] meets the road. That's where I want for
[1:38:22] us to get to right now. Where the rubber
[1:38:24] meets the road.
[1:38:26] Now that's what makes the subject very
[1:38:29] unique because Daniel is identifying
[1:38:32] something to us that we need to pay
[1:38:34] attention to. He comes and he talks
[1:38:38] about this man Gabriel in the book of
[1:38:41] Matthew is the angel Gabriel. But when
[1:38:44] he when Daniel speaks he says this man
[1:38:46] Gabriel because the angel was not an
[1:38:49] angel with wing he was an angel like a
[1:38:51] man. That's what Daniel call him the man
[1:38:54] Gabriel. Praise the Lord. And now he's
[1:38:57] talking about this man and and and and
[1:38:59] and Gabriel is giving the message to him
[1:39:02] and telling him when Maziah the prince
[1:39:05] the prince of of of your
[1:39:07] people. Now this is where it gets
[1:39:09] interesting.
[1:39:11] People put on your seat belt because
[1:39:14] it's it's about to get
[1:39:16] spooky. It's about to get
[1:39:19] scary. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:22] Amen. We just don't come to church to
[1:39:24] make you to feel good. We want to make
[1:39:26] you cry sometimes. Amen. We have
[1:39:29] something for
[1:39:33] everybody. Are we together?
[1:39:37] Now, let's go here now to Daniel chapter
[1:39:39] 10.
[1:39:40] Where the subject gets
[1:39:43] interesting. Oh
[1:39:45] my. Praise the
[1:39:48] Lord. Where the subject gets
[1:39:50] interesting,
[1:39:53] people. Man, I feel like I'm preaching
[1:39:56] on a convention this
[1:39:58] morning. Amen. I can feel the
[1:40:04] connection. I can feel the
[1:40:06] connection. Are we together?
[1:40:09] Now, so he he speaks to Daniel a year
[1:40:13] and he says to
[1:40:16] Daniel, he says to
[1:40:21] Daniel, there's a drama that was in my
[1:40:24] mind that I wanted to to play out to
[1:40:32] you. Let's let's
[1:40:35] read. Let's read. We will get there.
[1:40:39] We'll get there. I hope I I I will be
[1:40:41] I'll be inspired to be able to play out
[1:40:43] so you can see
[1:40:45] it. Daniel chapter
[1:41:00] 10. Are we together? Let's read from
[1:41:04] verse 12. Daniel chapter 10. Then say he
[1:41:06] unto me, Fear not,
[1:41:08] Daniel, for from the first day that thou
[1:41:12] set your heart to
[1:41:15] understand and to chasten thyself before
[1:41:19] thy God. That's what fasting is. It's
[1:41:22] not hunger
[1:41:24] strike. You are chastening yourself. You
[1:41:27] are disciplining yourself before God.
[1:41:30] Amen. From the first day you set your
[1:41:33] heart to understand these things and you
[1:41:36] chasting thyself before God, thy word
[1:41:39] was
[1:41:40] heard and and I am come for thy words.
[1:41:47] But the
[1:41:48] prince of the kingdom of
[1:41:52] Peshure. Now that's where this word
[1:41:56] prince takes another connotation for us.
[1:42:02] Now you will see why Daniel used Maziah
[1:42:05] the
[1:42:06] prince because because Daniel was
[1:42:11] binging with territorial
[1:42:16] spirits. He was binging with principal
[1:42:20] spirits. He was binging with spirits
[1:42:23] that were ruling a nation. Like every
[1:42:27] nation has a spirit.
[1:42:30] Amen. So when he said Messiah the
[1:42:34] prince is to bring our own captain into
[1:42:39] position.
[1:42:42] Praise the Lord. Is to bring our own
[1:42:45] force into position.
[1:42:48] Are we together? Praise the
[1:42:51] Lord. I'm telling you, I'm having a good
[1:42:53] time up here. I'm just enjoying
[1:42:57] myself. Amen.
[1:43:00] He said, "From the moment you make your
[1:43:03] request, from the moment you set your
[1:43:06] face and lift up your
[1:43:08] hands to cry and understand the words of
[1:43:13] Jeremiah, I was commanded from the
[1:43:15] throne to bring your
[1:43:19] request." Praise the Lord.
[1:43:23] But in the
[1:43:26] atmosphere, there were spirits that were
[1:43:30] deployed. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:34] Amen. Hallelujah. I told you I say it's
[1:43:37] going to get
[1:43:38] spooky. It's going to get
[1:43:41] scary because you and myself, we are not
[1:43:45] exempted from those things. Amen. There
[1:43:49] are spirits that are
[1:43:54] deployed to set you off on things that
[1:43:57] are concerning
[1:43:59] you. Praise the
[1:44:01] Lord. There are spirits that are
[1:44:03] deployed to war against
[1:44:06] you. Amen. And all the purpose of that
[1:44:10] spirit is to discredit the word of God
[1:44:15] and make you to make your own choice to
[1:44:18] run your own life when you did not give
[1:44:20] it to yourself in the first place.
[1:44:25] It it it discredit the word. It did it
[1:44:30] it takes away the appetite of reading
[1:44:32] the word.
[1:44:33] It makes you not to understand what you
[1:44:36] are reading. If you are not
[1:44:38] understanding what you are reading, how
[1:44:40] will you have interest to read the Bible
[1:44:41] every
[1:44:44] day when it just look like a bunch of
[1:44:46] confusing spirit? I mean uh confusing uh
[1:44:49] uh uh
[1:44:52] story. Are we
[1:44:57] together? And why why why the h uh is is
[1:45:01] to discredit the word
[1:45:04] because the word was given to us for us
[1:45:07] to equip ourself. The best thing that
[1:45:10] God could put in the hands of any mortal
[1:45:13] man is his word. Why? Because he is his
[1:45:17] word.
[1:45:19] He's our defense. He's our provider.
[1:45:23] He's the one that fights our battle.
[1:45:27] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] So when you when you start to immerse
[1:45:33] yourself in the word, then angels and it
[1:45:36] come about
[1:45:45] you. Are we
[1:45:47] together? From the moment you set forth
[1:45:50] your face to understand these things
[1:45:52] Daniel and you chastening yourself
[1:45:54] before the Lord. Your words were heard
[1:45:56] and I was sin with thy word. But the
[1:45:59] praise of the the kingdom of Pure withto
[1:46:03] me 21 days. And I will tell you in those
[1:46:08] days even if there were gay and lesbian
[1:46:12] it was not popular like
[1:46:15] now. In those days if I mean there was
[1:46:18] some sense of
[1:46:20] decency. The kingdom were uh the people
[1:46:23] were respectful to their laws but we
[1:46:26] living in a lawless time right from uh
[1:46:30] from uh the government the church
[1:46:32] everywhere lawlessness all over the
[1:46:34] place.
[1:46:36] I'm saying that to say if Daniel was
[1:46:40] handled 21
[1:46:43] days where there was
[1:46:47] distancing. Praise the
[1:46:51] Lord. Amen. Where were where there was
[1:46:54] distancing? How much more about this
[1:46:57] time where
[1:46:59] lawlessness is the rule of the day?
[1:47:03] Everybody get their own
[1:47:06] law.
[1:47:08] Amen. Lawlessness is the root of the
[1:47:11] day. How much more does the believers
[1:47:14] handle? You look at the things on the
[1:47:17] news, you are handled by it. You look at
[1:47:19] the things on the street, they handle
[1:47:21] you. Nothing there to to even edify
[1:47:24] you. Praise the Lord. You can't even
[1:47:27] read the news to feel edify. It just
[1:47:30] grieve your spirit. It handles
[1:47:36] you. Glory be to
[1:47:39] God. And you think we will make it
[1:47:41] through this age by just being church
[1:47:43] members. You think you will make it
[1:47:45] through this
[1:47:47] age by just joining a church. You need
[1:47:51] more than that. You need a birth. You
[1:47:54] need a baptism.
[1:47:57] You need a a Messiah nag in your life.
[1:48:02] You need the power of the anointed word
[1:48:06] to be able to guide your mind from all
[1:48:09] the filthiness in the street. Be able to
[1:48:12] guard your spirit.
[1:48:16] The prince of
[1:48:17] Pure Henry 21 days there was spiritual
[1:48:22] warfare. Praise the Lord. Swords was
[1:48:26] drawn, demons were slayed in the
[1:48:31] heavens,
[1:48:32] fighting on behalf of the elect. And if
[1:48:36] that happened this time, the same thing
[1:48:38] is happening right now. I believe the
[1:48:40] same thing is happening this morning
[1:48:42] while I'm preaching the word of God.
[1:48:45] Demons have been slayed in the heavens
[1:48:47] because there is bunch of spirit here to
[1:48:49] make you sleep and carry your mind all
[1:48:51] over the place.
[1:48:57] Are we together?
[1:49:03] Love the Lord. That's why we are here
[1:49:05] because we love
[1:49:08] him. Glory be to
[1:49:12] God. Daniel say I was handle. But listen
[1:49:16] to this now. You're going to get you're
[1:49:17] going to get sweet. I love it. Praise
[1:49:20] the Lord. I love it.
[1:49:23] He says, "But the prince of the kingdom
[1:49:26] of Persia withto me one h and 20 days.
[1:49:29] But Lord
[1:49:31] Michael, one of the chief
[1:49:36] princes came to help
[1:49:39] me."
[1:49:41] Now we shouldn't run wild with this, but
[1:49:45] just relate it. He said,
[1:49:48] "Maziah the prince."
[1:49:51] And years say he's calling
[1:49:54] Michael the chief
[1:49:59] prince. We will get to that. Just keep
[1:50:01] that in the back of your mind. Are we
[1:50:04] together? So uh uh uh uh uh uh you you
[1:50:08] look at this. Look at this. Angelic
[1:50:11] beings angelic beings in
[1:50:16] warfare running to the rescue of one
[1:50:18] another.
[1:50:21] Amen. Angelic beings in warfare running
[1:50:24] to the rescue of one
[1:50:27] another. But then we sit down. We run to
[1:50:30] the destruction of one
[1:50:32] another. The church, the people of
[1:50:38] God, Gabriel calling for help. And yet
[1:50:42] we will be dealing with things in our
[1:50:44] lives that are destroying us. We can't
[1:50:48] look for help. We can't call for
[1:50:52] help. The angels understand God's
[1:50:58] principle that he is our help. God
[1:51:02] himself identify himself as our help,
[1:51:06] present help in time of trouble. Which
[1:51:09] mean we all need help.
[1:51:12] And when you need help, call for it.
[1:51:14] Because you don't call for it, it's to
[1:51:16] your own destruction. People will be
[1:51:18] dealing with things in their
[1:51:20] lives,
[1:51:21] drowning, no touch with God,
[1:51:25] empty, and they just dragging that
[1:51:29] cups. Instead of asking for help,
[1:51:32] calling for
[1:51:33] help. If you think I can give it to you,
[1:51:36] find somebody else. You need
[1:51:43] it. Are we together?
[1:51:48] M of the chief princess came to my help,
[1:51:52] came to help me and I remain
[1:51:56] there with the
[1:51:58] king of
[1:52:00] Pure. Spiritual
[1:52:02] warfare. Spiritual warfare not only in
[1:52:05] the days of Daniel is going on right
[1:52:09] now. Is going on right now. And these
[1:52:12] spirits do not have good intention for
[1:52:15] you. They don't have good intention for
[1:52:18] you. They want to drag you down into
[1:52:20] drugs, drag you down into uh uh h
[1:52:25] destruction. Are we together?
[1:52:28] These spirits don't have good
[1:52:34] intention. You love the
[1:52:37] Lord. Let's continue to read. Still in
[1:52:40] Daniel chapter 10, let's look there in
[1:52:42] verse 19.
[1:52:48] and said, "All men greatly beloved fear
[1:52:52] now." Speaking to Daniel, the angels
[1:52:54] speaking, "Peace be unto thee. Be
[1:52:57] strong." Yes, be
[1:52:59] strong. And when he has spoken unto me,
[1:53:05] I was strengthened. When I heard the
[1:53:07] word, I was strengthened. and said, "Let
[1:53:11] my Lord speak, for thou hast
[1:53:13] strengthened me." Praise the Lord. Then
[1:53:16] said he, "Knowest thou wherefore I've
[1:53:19] come on today, and
[1:53:21] now will I return to fight with the
[1:53:24] prince of
[1:53:26] Persia? And when I am gone forth, Lord,
[1:53:30] the prince of Greece, Grecas shall
[1:53:33] come." Now you have to realize now he's
[1:53:35] talking about the changes of the
[1:53:38] kingdom.
[1:53:39] They were in the Babylonian kingdom. The
[1:53:41] next kingdom after the Babylonian
[1:53:44] kingdom was going to be the Persia
[1:53:46] kingdom and the next kingdom after that
[1:53:48] was going to be
[1:53:50] Greece. Now, so each one of these
[1:53:52] kingdom had a
[1:53:55] prince. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:54:00] So he was trying to ident if we deal
[1:54:03] with the prince of Persia the next the
[1:54:06] next spirit is
[1:54:08] coming the same thing in our life when
[1:54:11] you deal with one thing another thing
[1:54:13] rise
[1:54:15] up
[1:54:17] amen we are not lying on flinging bags
[1:54:20] of
[1:54:21] ease we are called to a
[1:54:24] fight if you are not able to fight take
[1:54:27] the word of God as the sword of God and
[1:54:29] stand on the promise of God, you will
[1:54:32] have a disgraceful Christian life. And
[1:54:34] you know the worst thing about it is
[1:54:36] that your own conscience will tell you
[1:54:40] you are not a kind of a Christian that
[1:54:41] you supposed to
[1:54:43] be. Now what other people will say, your
[1:54:46] own conscience will tell you you're not
[1:54:49] living up to the word like you're
[1:54:50] supposed to.
[1:55:01] Praise the
[1:55:02] Lord. You love the Lord. We're talking
[1:55:05] about spiritual
[1:55:06] warfare. We're talking about the things
[1:55:09] that concern us. We all go through
[1:55:19] it now. So he's telling him here that
[1:55:22] after So we realize that every nation
[1:55:24] has a spirit. Amen. Every nation has a
[1:55:28] spirit. Every government that comes has
[1:55:31] their own
[1:55:33] spirit. And that's the thing that
[1:55:35] suppresses the
[1:55:37] people. Praise the
[1:55:39] Lord. Are we
[1:55:43] together? We must look for the kingdom
[1:55:46] of God to reign in our heart.
[1:55:49] There is no political government in this
[1:55:51] on this earth have any solution for us.
[1:55:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. They don't have
[1:55:57] solution for us. They are not gathering
[1:55:59] for the
[1:56:03] millennium. Are we together?
[1:56:06] So we see we see those
[1:56:09] things and uh you will realize that when
[1:56:14] you come over to the New Testament the
[1:56:17] New Testament do not exempt those
[1:56:19] things. Jesus himself he called the
[1:56:23] devil the prince of this
[1:56:26] word.
[1:56:30] Amen. He called the devil the prince of
[1:56:33] this word.
[1:56:37] Let's look at some scriptures quickly as
[1:56:40] we try to find a place to land here
[1:56:43] because you notice we are not done.
[1:56:44] Amen. We just want to find a place to
[1:56:49] land to be able to regroup ourself again
[1:56:52] and then get into battle.
[1:56:55] Matthew chapter 12:24 we realize here
[1:56:58] the Bible says the Pharisees said unto
[1:57:01] Jesus but when the Pharisee heard it
[1:57:03] they said this fellow does not cast out
[1:57:05] devil but by the prince of devils. So it
[1:57:10] was it was something that were believed.
[1:57:13] It was something that the the the the
[1:57:17] religious world knew that there were
[1:57:20] they were they were
[1:57:21] prince of evil
[1:57:24] spirits. Praise the Lord. Amen. They
[1:57:28] were prince. Every bad habit is
[1:57:31] controlled by the bad
[1:57:33] spirit. That just the underlying thing.
[1:57:36] Every bad habit is influenced by the bad
[1:57:44] spirit. Don't never make it your family
[1:57:46] spirit because your families are not
[1:57:49] demons. It's just a bad
[1:57:52] spirit. Amen. It's a bad spirit that
[1:57:55] needs to be rebuked, that needs to be
[1:57:57] fight against. Don't say it's from my
[1:57:59] family. You're not you're not from
[1:58:01] demons.
[1:58:08] Jesus over here in St. John 12:31, he
[1:58:11] says, "Now is the judgment of this
[1:58:15] world. Now shall the prince of this
[1:58:18] world be cast out."
[1:58:23] in chapter 14 verse 30 uh when he spoke
[1:58:27] about the comforter he says afterward I
[1:58:30] will not talk much with you for the
[1:58:34] prince of this world cometh and have
[1:58:37] nothing in me. So Jesus is identifying
[1:58:42] there is a prince there is a an
[1:58:45] authoritative spirit that governs this
[1:58:48] word. Amen. Praise the Lord. There is an
[1:58:53] authoritative spirit that govern this
[1:58:55] word. Our only protection from it is to
[1:58:58] come under the word of God. I don't care
[1:59:00] who you are, how you were born, where
[1:59:02] you are
[1:59:03] born. We were all born in sin shiply in
[1:59:07] iniquity. Amen. We come directly under
[1:59:11] the influence of
[1:59:14] lies. Are we together? The word of God
[1:59:17] is our only deliverer. The word of God
[1:59:20] is our only
[1:59:22] protector. Amen. It's the word that cuts
[1:59:25] us away from those things. Are we
[1:59:28] together? Now see what uh uh
[1:59:33] uh Paul will say in Ephesians 2.
[1:59:36] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and two. He
[1:59:39] says, "And you have he
[1:59:42] quickened, who were dead in trespass and
[1:59:46] sin, were in time past, ye walk, I call
[1:59:49] into the the course of this word. I call
[1:59:53] into the prince of the power of the air,
[1:59:57] the spirit that now walketh in the
[2:00:00] children of
[2:00:03] disobedience." See identifying it to
[2:00:05] that
[2:00:07] prince. It's a power. It's an influence.
[2:00:11] It's a evil
[2:00:15] anointing that is sending all of our
[2:00:18] young people into drugs, destroying
[2:00:20] their youth, destroying their
[2:00:28] mind. Praise the
[2:00:32] Lord. The prince of the power of the
[2:00:36] air. You just even even our Lord Jesus
[2:00:40] identify it. He says the prince of this
[2:00:43] word is stay
[2:00:50] loose. Even he himself was in the
[2:00:54] word. He was living here and he's
[2:00:58] identifying
[2:01:01] it. Are we together?
[2:01:06] A Christian life is not a carefree life.
[2:01:09] It's not a careless life. A Christian
[2:01:11] life is a disciplined life.
[2:01:14] A Christian life is a life of observing.
[2:01:17] We take
[2:01:19] counts. We take
[2:01:22] counts. You watch things in your life.
[2:01:24] You take inventory. How am I doing? You
[2:01:28] talk to yourself.
[2:01:34] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:49] That's the reason why when the devil
[2:01:53] destroy take a person from the word and
[2:01:56] destroy prayer in your life, you become
[2:01:59] a powerless
[2:02:03] Christian. You live with guilt. Your
[2:02:05] life becomes so
[2:02:07] heavy. You wake up in the morning, you
[2:02:10] get tired. You didn't do anything. you
[2:02:12] just
[2:02:15] tired. It almost looks like all of those
[2:02:17] springs of the power of the air was
[2:02:19] stepping on you all through the
[2:02:29] night. Are we together?
[2:02:36] John will say in Revelation 3:1,
[2:02:39] "Blessed is he that readeth, and they
[2:02:42] that hear the word of this prophecy, and
[2:02:45] keep those things which are written
[2:02:47] therein, for the time is at hand." There
[2:02:50] is a blessing in reading the word.
[2:02:53] There's a blessing in hearing the
[2:02:57] word. Praise the Lord.
[2:03:00] The moment you touch you you take the
[2:03:02] word and you are reading it, angels are
[2:03:05] deployed
[2:03:10] because that was the first form that God
[2:03:12] took. In the beginning was the
[2:03:14] word and when God took that form when
[2:03:17] the angels were created to worship him
[2:03:20] they were worshiping the word.
[2:03:29] That's why the prophet will make it
[2:03:31] simple. Read your Bible and pray every
[2:03:35] day. That's the way to
[2:03:38] grow. That's the way to
[2:03:40] grow. Read the Bible and pray every
[2:03:45] day. And just see how your life will
[2:03:49] change. You will see how things will
[2:03:52] drop away from your life. you I mean
[2:03:55] unless you are a preacher if you're not
[2:03:58] a preacher don't be studying and you
[2:04:00] know and and try no just read the word
[2:04:03] enjoy it put yourself in it and enjoy
[2:04:06] the story enjoy interact with the
[2:04:11] word and just see how it would change
[2:04:14] your
[2:04:24] life. Blessed is he that readeth and
[2:04:27] they that hear the word. We have it on
[2:04:30] our iPhone, on our phones, and and uh
[2:04:33] you know, you just play. No
[2:04:35] excuse. No excuse. Keep yourself in the
[2:04:38] atmosphere of the
[2:04:42] word because that's where your healing
[2:04:44] is. That's where your delivering
[2:04:47] is. Praise the
[2:04:50] Lord. Wednesday night, we pray for
[2:04:52] sister car. And then uh I think on
[2:04:55] Thursday or so
[2:04:58] uh they had rush her to the hospital
[2:05:01] with her blood pressure. Brother Wesley
[2:05:03] sent me the text this morning. I forgot.
[2:05:06] and ask that we pray for her. She's back
[2:05:08] home, but they have changed her blood
[2:05:11] pressure meds and all of that. So, we we
[2:05:14] just want to keep
[2:05:16] her in our hearts as we preach the word.
[2:05:19] Amen. Praise the Lord. The word have so
[2:05:22] much power to heal her right now.
[2:05:32] So, you see, you see the prince part.
[2:05:35] You see word where word uh uh uh Daniel
[2:05:38] was giving his heart to understand the
[2:05:41] prophecy of Jeremiah. He was trying to
[2:05:44] understand the 70th week. He he was
[2:05:46] giving his heart to the
[2:05:49] word. It created an attraction in heaven
[2:05:52] that a son of God want to understand his
[2:05:55] time. He want to understand the day that
[2:05:57] he's living. God deplored an angel. go
[2:06:01] and help him
[2:06:02] understand. The same thing with the
[2:06:04] Ethiopian Enoch. He was reading the book
[2:06:07] of Isaiah. He could not understand it.
[2:06:09] God told Philillip from a revival in
[2:06:12] Samir, dash him in the wilderness and
[2:06:15] say, "Help him to understand." If you
[2:06:17] have a desire to understand, God will
[2:06:19] make you understand. God will open your
[2:06:21] understanding.
[2:06:27] You are not interested in God's word
[2:06:29] more than himself. God is more
[2:06:32] interested to make himself known to you
[2:06:34] than you desire
[2:06:39] to. Daniel wanted to understand what is
[2:06:42] this 70th week? When will it be over?
[2:06:45] What is this all
[2:06:48] about? It brought an attention to
[2:06:51] heaven. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:55] Amen. And God the blooded angels and say
[2:06:58] go and give my son
[2:07:02] understanding. I challenge you read
[2:07:05] something in the word and you think you
[2:07:07] don't understand it. Pray about it. Say
[2:07:09] Lord I wish to understand this better.
[2:07:12] Just prayed about it. Come back and read
[2:07:15] it again and pray about it. God will use
[2:07:19] something in your life. He will use
[2:07:22] something happening around you and it
[2:07:25] will just strike
[2:07:27] you. This word is a living word. It
[2:07:30] lives. It's real. It's truth.
[2:07:40] Are we
[2:07:43] together? So you see the prince part.
[2:07:46] You see where the prince comes in play.
[2:07:52] Daniel is identifying the power that
[2:07:56] came to his
[2:07:57] rescue as Messiah the prince. He's
[2:08:02] identifying the power that came to his
[2:08:05] defense, Michael the chief
[2:08:10] prince. Are we
[2:08:15] together? That's that's how God heal us.
[2:08:18] That's how he deliver
[2:08:24] us. Sometimes he just drop a thought of
[2:08:27] his word in our mind and you and you
[2:08:30] just think on it. Oh wow. I Yeah, I read
[2:08:33] that thing in the Bible. That word that
[2:08:36] is dropped in your
[2:08:38] heart has done something. It never just
[2:08:41] only comes to remind
[2:08:43] you. Amen.
[2:08:46] It's just like when Jesus said flesh and
[2:08:49] blood has not revealed but my father it
[2:08:53] was something that dropped down from
[2:08:55] heaven and it's just dropped in Peter
[2:08:57] heart. Thou art the Christ son of the
[2:08:59] living
[2:09:01] God. Praise the Lord. I remember down
[2:09:04] there in in uh in in Shivak, Alaska,
[2:09:07] preaching there one time and and one of
[2:09:09] the
[2:09:10] brothers, you know, uh uh uh was
[2:09:13] testifying. You know, his boys started
[2:09:16] getting on on on drugs and drinking and
[2:09:19] all of that. And you know, the Lord had
[2:09:21] just had just saved him to out of
[2:09:23] drinking, deliver him from drinking. And
[2:09:26] uh I mean, this this was this was a
[2:09:28] stone drinker. I mean drunker. This is
[2:09:30] somebody that was that was the town knew
[2:09:33] him for that you know and the Lord had
[2:09:35] really delivered our brother and he said
[2:09:37] he was just laying down on on his bed
[2:09:39] and you know uh and he was just you know
[2:09:42] in that place of of regret and he was
[2:09:46] just you know asking the Lord for mercy
[2:09:48] seeing how his life has affected his son
[2:09:51] and all of that. He was just lying on
[2:09:54] the bed and
[2:09:55] uh and then while he was lying on the
[2:09:58] bed he says the the scripture of Isaiah
[2:10:01] came to his mind when the enemy come as
[2:10:04] a flawed the spirit of the Lord will
[2:10:06] raise up a standard he said he just
[2:10:09] jumper from his bed he said yes Lord you
[2:10:11] are the stander you can deliver me
[2:10:14] praise the Lord and that word was his
[2:10:17] deliverance and God helped his sons
[2:10:22] praise the Lord Lord, you can practice
[2:10:24] this word. It's not human. It's not
[2:10:26] human uh uh thing to practice. It's
[2:10:29] divine.
[2:10:32] Amen. It's
[2:10:35] divine. God back his
[2:10:38] word. Are we together?
[2:10:42] You love the Lord. Amen. Are you tired?
[2:10:51] Are you hungry?
[2:10:58] Well, thank you for bearing with me. Let
[2:10:59] me read something to you and then we
[2:11:01] close
[2:11:05] here. I'll come back to this. We can
[2:11:08] take it all. Hear his voice. Honor the
[2:11:12] prince. Hear his voice.
[2:11:17] He had been delayed 21 days because of
[2:11:20] the evil in the
[2:11:22] land. And if he was delayed 21 days
[2:11:25] because of the evil of that land in the
[2:11:29] days of Persia, what will he be in this
[2:11:33] day? How long could he be
[2:11:38] delayed? Amen.
[2:11:40] Praise the Lord. and uh and and and it
[2:11:44] is all of those things that nominal
[2:11:48] Christians don't understand and they
[2:11:50] think that prayer don't
[2:11:53] work. They think that God don't answer
[2:11:55] prayer because of the way they think
[2:11:59] about
[2:12:01] it. Praise the Lord.
[2:12:13] What will he be in this day? How long
[2:12:15] could he be
[2:12:16] delayed? But that undying faith, that
[2:12:21] hunger and desire in the human heart
[2:12:24] that won't say no. Praise the Lord. No
[2:12:28] matter how much is delayed, we will keep
[2:12:31] believing.
[2:12:33] We will keep holding on. We will keep
[2:12:35] praying. We keep rejoicing because we
[2:12:38] know that God is faithful.
[2:12:42] That undying
[2:12:46] faith. Praise the Lord. Jesus said even
[2:12:50] before you open your mouth, the father
[2:12:52] knows what you want to
[2:12:54] say. Even before you open your mouth, he
[2:12:57] knows what you want to say. But you have
[2:13:00] to understand these
[2:13:02] principles. You have to understand these
[2:13:04] things that are happening.
[2:13:13] It's not a time to
[2:13:15] complain or to cry.
[2:13:18] It's the time to keep praising, keep
[2:13:20] worshiping, keep thanking God.
[2:13:28] But that undying faith, that hunger and
[2:13:31] desire in the human heart that won't say
[2:13:33] no to God, but will hold on till God
[2:13:37] speak from
[2:13:39] heaven. You can't play with
[2:13:42] this with this
[2:13:44] gospel. is not to be played
[2:13:51] with. It must hit the T 10 times out of
[2:13:55] 10. It got to be perfect or or it isn't
[2:13:59] right and it won't work. It got to be
[2:14:03] perfect. The word, everything that God
[2:14:06] said is
[2:14:08] truth. Every promise that God made, he
[2:14:12] can fulfill.
[2:14:16] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:21] God is faithful at his
[2:14:23] word. If we would just know how much
[2:14:26] this word is for our
[2:14:30] benefit. It's not the
[2:14:33] emotion. It's not the thing that we get
[2:14:36] ourself through. Is this word falling in
[2:14:38] love with this
[2:14:40] word? Loving this word more than our
[2:14:44] desirable
[2:14:46] meal. Man shall not live by bread alone
[2:14:50] but by every word of God. Because
[2:14:53] everything you need to live is in this
[2:14:55] book.
[2:15:05] Musicians, you can
[2:15:07] come. Thank you for bearing with
[2:15:14] me. If you let me, I will preach till
[2:15:17] tonight. Like I say, I'm fired up. I'm
[2:15:21] on a cup of coffee.
[2:15:24] Amen. And I'm doing good so far. I still
[2:15:28] feed God.
[2:15:31] But I just want us to get to that
[2:15:34] place and just think about think about
[2:15:37] this thing. Think about think about your
[2:15:40] relationship with the word of
[2:15:43] God. Think about how much are we
[2:15:47] prioritizing the word of God in our
[2:15:51] lives. What we take it to be.
[2:15:55] What we take it to
[2:15:56] be when we hear the word is it say man's
[2:16:00] opinion when you listen to the
[2:16:04] text the word being
[2:16:10] preached. Are you loving the word? Are
[2:16:13] you embracing the word?
[2:16:17] Or there is a place in the world you are
[2:16:36] struggling. Word of life ever truth
[2:16:38] changing me changing
[2:16:41] you. Let's sing that together before we
[2:16:44] go to pray.

[2:18:42] Let the word impart.

[2:18:48] preeminence. Let resolve our differences
[2:18:50] with the word. You cannot resolve your
[2:18:54] differences with your
[2:18:55] feelings. Oh, I feel like this or I feel
[2:18:58] like that. No, resolve it with the
[2:19:01] word. Look, the word says this and let's
[2:19:04] say amen to the
[2:19:05] [Music]
[2:19:08] word. Resolve your struggle with the
[2:19:10] word.
[2:19:14] [Music]
[2:19:20] He has magnified his word above his
[2:19:23] name. The name of of Jesus will not have
[2:19:27] an
[2:19:28] effect if the word is not in
[2:19:32] place. If you don't have regard to the
[2:19:35] word of God, you using his name in vain.
[2:19:39] You are just using his name in vain
[2:19:42] because you don't have regard to his
[2:19:45] word. That's how much God takes his word
[2:19:55] serious. Let's sing that again. Ancient
[2:19:58] word.

[2:20:53] captain. The word is your blet. That's
[2:20:56] what the devil sees and he back up. Not
[2:20:59] your phases, not your loud voices. Is
[2:21:03] the
[2:21:04] word. Show him the promise of God. Show
