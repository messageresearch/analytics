[56:25] the Lord
[56:27] I just want to just uh uh bring a few
[56:31] words of encouragement to us tonight and
[56:34] uh
[56:36] uh remind us the service Services again
[56:40] is uh starts on Saturday night and uh
[56:43] brother Jordan his wife fly in on Friday
[56:47] evening and uh so
[56:50] Saturday uh what time do we have down
[56:52] for the meetings 6:30
[56:57] uh sister anetta what is the time we
[56:59] had the time we had for Saturday
[57:07] night 6 okay 6 p.m. let's be see 6 p.m
[57:13] and and
[57:15] U
[57:17] um praise the Lord now I I was I was
[57:21] kind of meditating on this thought and
[57:23] that's what I want to share with you
[57:25] tonight
[57:28] draw night unto the Lord actually when I
[57:31] was uh meditating on it I entitled it
[57:35] draw me
[57:36] nearer uh um because I was just thinking
[57:41] about uh how sometimes
[57:45] translation can uh can change the
[57:49] effect of uh what was really said amen
[57:54] sometime translation can change the
[57:56] effect of of uh what was really said so
[58:00] tonight uh I'm not I'm not go I'm not
[58:03] interpreting the scripture I just want
[58:05] us to to be able to take the scripture
[58:09] in the context of how we have been
[58:11] taught by the message of the hour and by
[58:13] the opening of the word to be able to
[58:16] just appreciate the word you know we we
[58:19] uh we read this uh you know over and
[58:23] over you know and you hear it uh you
[58:25] know the the God bless the the
[58:29] Evangelist you know most of the time we
[58:31] is used for alter called is used to
[58:34] encourage people draw night onto God and
[58:38] He will draw night onto you praise the
[58:41] Lord and uh uh uh and then you can you
[58:45] can look through the scripture you know
[58:48] uh you will see that uh uh in in in few
[58:51] places is uh is used like that but what
[58:55] what actually caught my mind is is just
[58:58] kind of for thinking on it you can see
[59:00] why I I name it draw me
[59:05] nearer uh because the thing about it
[59:08] there is that Jesus said you
[59:12] know uh no man come unto the
[59:15] father except by me
[59:19] amen and uh so scripturally is is uh
[59:24] it's established that he's the one that
[59:26] draw
[59:28] Us Praise the Lord so the the very
[59:32] desire of us want to draw near to
[59:36] God it is the place where we know that
[59:39] we are feeling the
[59:42] P
[59:44] amen are we together we are feeding the
[59:48] pool our Drawing Near unto the Lord is
[59:52] an effect of he pulling us to him
[59:56] it is not it is not our
[59:59] effort praise the Lord and that is that
[1:00:03] is the beautiful thing about the
[1:00:06] Redemption story The more we can take
[1:00:08] ourself out of the picture and begin to
[1:00:11] see that it is God that is working
[1:00:14] through
[1:00:15] us the more this whole thing can become
[1:00:19] beautiful praise the Lord that's the
[1:00:21] reason why his strength can be made
[1:00:24] perfect in our weakness
[1:00:27] because if it was just left to us to do
[1:00:30] the work we don't we don't have that
[1:00:32] strength we don't have that Grace so so
[1:00:35] that's what we want to look at tonight I
[1:00:37] will read some few things uh uh to you
[1:00:40] tonight uh uh uh just just to you know
[1:00:44] just to encourage you to come to come
[1:00:46] behind uh uh what what we share with you
[1:00:50] on on
[1:00:52] um on Sunday I was listening to the
[1:00:56] message behind the curtain of time you
[1:00:58] know brother B preach it on on uh
[1:01:02] uh March 5th so I I just listening to
[1:01:05] that and and there were just few things
[1:01:07] that came out of there that I thought I
[1:01:09] would share tonight at this uh prayer
[1:01:12] meeting now so he goes ahead and he
[1:01:15] starts here just just watch this it's
[1:01:18] beautiful I come back to my top he says
[1:01:20] now do you think that God listen to this
[1:01:24] now do you think that God who now your
[1:01:28] faith gets to a spot now do you think
[1:01:31] that what will you think now if all of
[1:01:36] the
[1:01:37] effort that this Tabernacle and this
[1:01:41] group of people year has put forth for
[1:01:45] the kingdom of
[1:01:46] God there's many
[1:01:49] year uh that
[1:01:54] uh L is your
[1:01:56] children for the kingdom of God you use
[1:01:59] your children resources your family
[1:02:02] resources there's many year that's gone
[1:02:05] with our club for the kingdom of God
[1:02:08] there's many who have rode through storm
[1:02:11] and walk with no shoes on their feet to
[1:02:15] get to the Tabernacle year that's right
[1:02:19] for the kingdom of God listen to this
[1:02:21] now this this really meant a whole lot
[1:02:23] to me a minister to me and I hope he
[1:02:26] would do the same to you could you
[1:02:28] imagine an artist painting a great
[1:02:30] picture
[1:02:31] beautiful till it sub line and then just
[1:02:37] tear it
[1:02:40] up praise the Lord could you imagine
[1:02:45] that there will be something wrong with
[1:02:48] that
[1:02:49] artist could you imagine a composer
[1:02:53] write a song on tell it
[1:02:58] suine and then just tear his music
[1:03:04] up are we together
[1:03:07] amen there will be something wrong with
[1:03:10] that composer
[1:03:12] see there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:17] God God Don't Make a thing like that
[1:03:22] just to tear it up and throw it away
[1:03:27] it's for his kingdom it's for his
[1:03:31] glory each one of us play a part in this
[1:03:36] picture of that artist amen he is our
[1:03:41] artist we play a part in the picture
[1:03:45] praise the
[1:03:48] Lord each one of us play a part in in
[1:03:52] this picture and in this song so brother
[1:03:56] Braham is bringing a a picture to us to
[1:04:00] understand that uh uh with all of our
[1:04:03] effort with everything that we do we
[1:04:06] wake up in the morning we pray for one
[1:04:08] another you know people come on our
[1:04:10] heart we pray for them we pray for the
[1:04:12] service we say Lord bless our little
[1:04:14] Church Father help us we prayed and you
[1:04:17] know we make effort to be able to come
[1:04:19] to church you know uh uh uh we make
[1:04:22] effort uh uh uh to support the kingdom
[1:04:25] of God so brother Bram is bringing all
[1:04:27] of this and says do you think that God
[1:04:32] will just tear the whole
[1:04:35] thing praise the Lord you have to
[1:04:39] remember that uh uh in the church ages
[1:04:42] he said he's not ungrateful to forget
[1:04:44] our labor of
[1:04:46] love praise the Lord every little thing
[1:04:49] that we are doing for the Lord you have
[1:04:51] to you have to that's that's what count
[1:04:54] if you are doing it you know what to
[1:04:56] make a name that name is going to go off
[1:04:58] the Earth one of these days amen if you
[1:05:00] are doing it to make an impression it's
[1:05:02] going to fail whatever we do for one
[1:05:05] another or for any more to do it for the
[1:05:07] Lord as long as you do it for the Lord
[1:05:10] you will never regret no matter how they
[1:05:13] treat you you will never regret do it
[1:05:15] for the Lord Do It for the
[1:05:20] kingdom are we together
[1:05:25] if you are coming on time come for the
[1:05:27] kingdom each one of us played a part in
[1:05:30] this picture and in this song we are a
[1:05:35] part of the Kingdom now so you see
[1:05:38] brother Brandon bring us to the place to
[1:05:40] realize that God is using our life in
[1:05:44] everything that we are going through is
[1:05:46] just like an artist with a pin
[1:05:49] brush praise the Lord he's the one that
[1:05:52] is that is that is doing this work he he
[1:05:55] bring brings every one of us around into
[1:05:58] this picture we are aligned in the
[1:06:01] song Praise the Lord you might not even
[1:06:05] be uh you
[1:06:06] know uh you know uh a line that that
[1:06:10] that have wor in it but each one of us
[1:06:14] we are part of this great
[1:06:17] music in his message Shalom that's what
[1:06:20] he was talking
[1:06:22] about we are part of this great music
[1:06:25] music that that is going on just a
[1:06:29] little
[1:06:31] part praise the
[1:06:33] Lord just a little part and he says God
[1:06:37] will net after laboring and laboring and
[1:06:43] laboring in our life and just take the
[1:06:46] whole thing and just tear
[1:06:48] it praise the
[1:06:50] Lord are we
[1:06:52] together he say something will be wrong
[1:06:55] with that artist something will be wrong
[1:06:58] with that uh uh uh musician he says but
[1:07:02] God there is nothing wrong with God Amen
[1:07:04] he knows exactly what he's doing he
[1:07:07] knows exactly what he's doing you know
[1:07:10] when brother Braham talk about the
[1:07:12] Masterpiece uh uh he he he he brought uh
[1:07:15] you know an acknowledgement like that he
[1:07:18] brought something up where he said uh uh
[1:07:21] uh you know uh uh a great musician you
[1:07:25] know you know sitting down and composing
[1:07:28] uh uh music he says he's writing you
[1:07:32] know and then he you know uh he uh
[1:07:35] strouble the sheet and put it in the
[1:07:38] trash you know and he find another line
[1:07:41] again he write he say the the the the
[1:07:43] the ones that he WRA up and put into the
[1:07:46] into the bin he did not he did not throw
[1:07:49] the words away he had just had more
[1:07:52] words so he take another sheet and add
[1:07:55] words ver to it again and and continue
[1:07:57] composing and brother bam said when he
[1:07:59] come up come out with that song he
[1:08:02] having uh a basket full of paper that he
[1:08:05] have wbed and throw in the trash he says
[1:08:08] and those papers are the Masterpiece he
[1:08:10] said because on each one of those paper
[1:08:12] they make the notes of this song that
[1:08:14] he's singing amen praise the
[1:08:17] Lord and uh uh so he goes on here he
[1:08:22] said uh each one of us play a part in
[1:08:25] this picture and in this song and we are
[1:08:28] a part of the kingdom of God and that is
[1:08:32] that we can play our part as long as we
[1:08:37] realize where we are positioning belong
[1:08:41] in this place and then stay right there
[1:08:46] in that place in one place to
[1:08:50] know it's in love because that's what
[1:08:55] makes up the picture love amen the love
[1:09:00] of God that's what makes up the picture
[1:09:01] so when we look at this scripture draw
[1:09:04] night unto me and you know draw night
[1:09:07] unto the Lord and and uh and He will
[1:09:09] draw night unto you uh uh you know the
[1:09:13] the the tough there is is for us to be
[1:09:16] able to realize you know now Jesus said
[1:09:18] if I be lifted up I will draw all men
[1:09:22] unto me so he has the draw drawing power
[1:09:27] praise the Lord he has the drawing power
[1:09:30] you see uh that is the thing that the
[1:09:33] church went through through the
[1:09:34] Reformation you know uh uh uh uh this
[1:09:38] this this this uh this writing of
[1:09:41] catholism on the church that that make
[1:09:44] the church to you know to to to work
[1:09:48] theirself up to be able to appease God
[1:09:50] and the people had to you know find weip
[1:09:53] and whips you know to do something for
[1:09:56] the Lord that that that stigma has left
[1:10:00] with the church that we always
[1:10:05] trying and and and you know and and in
[1:10:08] that way we also we are not seeing and
[1:10:12] appreciating what God is doing through
[1:10:15] us because we we kind of for make
[1:10:18] ourself the one that have to do they I
[1:10:21] have to pray I have to read I have to be
[1:10:24] in church
[1:10:26] and we are not seeing the bigger side of
[1:10:28] the picture that he is the
[1:10:31] one praise the Lord he is the
[1:10:35] one that is drawing
[1:10:38] us he is the one that is that is
[1:10:41] creating that that love within our
[1:10:44] hearts he is the one that is burdening
[1:10:52] us are we together praise Lord so we
[1:10:56] want to we we we just we want to keep
[1:10:58] that picture in our mind you know we
[1:11:01] want to keep that picture in our mind
[1:11:03] that he is the one that is drawing us
[1:11:06] amen no one can come unto me and uh uh
[1:11:11] uh come unto the father until the father
[1:11:15] draw them that's what Jesus said no one
[1:11:17] can come unto the father until the
[1:11:20] father draw in so there is a
[1:11:22] supernatural thing that that is going on
[1:11:26] praise the Lord amen there's a
[1:11:30] supernatural thing that is going on the
[1:11:34] Consciousness that it is service time
[1:11:37] the Consciousness that it is prayer time
[1:11:39] the
[1:11:42] Consciousness it's a supernatural thing
[1:11:45] it's something that is far beyond what
[1:11:47] our human mind can
[1:11:49] reason praise the
[1:11:51] Lord if it is just on our human effort
[1:11:55] is is going to
[1:11:56] fail it has to be the
[1:11:58] Lord are we together it has to be the
[1:12:02] Lord and that's the picture that we
[1:12:04] don't want to
[1:12:06] lust amen that we don't want to lust
[1:12:09] because even in the in in in in the time
[1:12:13] where we are weak in the time where we
[1:12:15] are
[1:12:16] feeling if that picture is there you
[1:12:18] will know that uh you know uh uh uh uh
[1:12:22] no matter what is going on I believe
[1:12:24] that the Lord
[1:12:25] will Rescue
[1:12:27] Me praise the
[1:12:29] Lord you see the Jews as a as a natural
[1:12:33] Seed of
[1:12:36] Abraham with what the Torah taught them
[1:12:39] that thing is is is you know is is
[1:12:42] graving within the Jews they know that
[1:12:45] they are a Seed of Abraham they know
[1:12:48] that God made a covenant with Abraham
[1:12:51] and and and and and through that
[1:12:53] Covenant their father Abraham will be
[1:12:56] the father of Nations so a Jew can be
[1:12:59] striking a business and and and you know
[1:13:02] and and he's he's trying to win this
[1:13:04] business deal and I mean uh uh uh he's
[1:13:07] he's even cheating the man on the
[1:13:09] business but he's doing it with a
[1:13:11] mindset that I'm a Seed of
[1:13:14] Abraham praise the Lord he's doing it
[1:13:17] with a mindset that I'm a Seed of
[1:13:19] Abraham the god of Abraham Isaac and
[1:13:21] Jacob will bless me
[1:13:26] praise the Lord is graving in his
[1:13:31] mind he can he he might not be a
[1:13:34] religious Jews to keep the Torah and and
[1:13:37] and he's not praying all the time but is
[1:13:40] graving in his
[1:13:46] mind from age 12 he he's he's he's
[1:13:49] taking over to to the temple or his
[1:13:52] father in the house set him down he he
[1:13:55] he's he's he's reading the Torah he's
[1:13:57] getting acquainted with the promises and
[1:13:59] the blessings and all of
[1:14:03] that he might not have a dealing like
[1:14:07] you and myself have with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:09] dealing with our heart but naturally is
[1:14:12] graving within
[1:14:14] him praise the Lord look at Jacob when
[1:14:18] he went to
[1:14:21] Laban
[1:14:23] amen when he went to Laban I mean it was
[1:14:25] it it was in him I mean he was he was
[1:14:28] right there he was he was just believing
[1:14:30] that I work for this man he have cheated
[1:14:33] me but God is going to bless
[1:14:37] me now the god that is going to bless
[1:14:39] him I mean he will not just laying down
[1:14:41] there and expecting the windows of
[1:14:43] Heaven to open no in his mind he was
[1:14:46] calculating what can I do to get more
[1:14:49] sheeps than this
[1:14:53] guy and he was counting that as God's
[1:15:01] blessing praise the Lord so if the
[1:15:04] natural Seed of Abraham it can be so
[1:15:07] graving in his heart that he's a Seed of
[1:15:10] Abraham and and and and and and uh uh uh
[1:15:13] you know Abraham is is uh is is his
[1:15:16] father you know Abraham was the man that
[1:15:19] God made a covenant with after after the
[1:15:22] destruction of the world if that thing
[1:15:24] can be so I mean uh graving in the in
[1:15:27] the heart of the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:15:30] how much more about you and
[1:15:35] myself to know that we have a promise he
[1:15:37] said I will never leave you I will never
[1:15:40] forsake you amen I will be with you even
[1:15:44] onto the
[1:15:48] end praise the
[1:15:53] Lord just like I said the
[1:15:56] church brought this approach to us where
[1:15:59] we have to work we need to do this we
[1:16:01] need to do that until we don't see how
[1:16:04] God is dealing with us it's it's it's
[1:16:08] more like you know what this is what I'm
[1:16:10] doing to stop this this is what I'm
[1:16:12] doing to stop this and and the picture
[1:16:17] of there's a man in the room there's a
[1:16:20] man that can turn on the
[1:16:22] light there's a one year that is
[1:16:25] changing our
[1:16:27] life praise the
[1:16:29] Lord he's the captain of the ship of
[1:16:32] Zion amen and as long as he's the
[1:16:36] captain this boat is not going to sink
[1:16:39] no matter how it's toasting here and
[1:16:42] there praise the Lord and that's the
[1:16:44] reason why Paul can go to
[1:16:48] sleep he can go to sleep because I mean
[1:16:51] he have just got a vision the Lord St by
[1:16:54] him that Di and told him Paul you go to
[1:16:56] sleep and you know have a good rest this
[1:16:59] boat will not
[1:17:02] sink and he's telling all the people on
[1:17:04] the boat if if y'all were just listening
[1:17:06] to me we going to
[1:17:10] arrive praise the lord we are going to
[1:17:14] arrive we will get
[1:17:20] there and that's the thing that I've
[1:17:23] been trying to label onor you know get
[1:17:26] us to that place to understand look
[1:17:32] people we did not know about a
[1:17:35] rapture we didn't know about a body
[1:17:37] change praise the Lord
[1:17:43] amen we never made a promise he made a
[1:17:46] promise about a Rapture he made a
[1:17:48] promise about the body
[1:17:50] change praise the Lord and the god that
[1:17:53] promised it is is more than able to
[1:17:56] bring it to
[1:18:00] pass no matter where we are no matter
[1:18:03] how tough it is it is just that place of
[1:18:08] having the grace that your faith can
[1:18:11] rise to the place to realize I'm not in
[1:18:13] control he's the one in
[1:18:17] control praise the
[1:18:20] Lord and that's why when we come to the
[1:18:22] Lord and we we we put ourselves there we
[1:18:25] see a promise in the world we say God
[1:18:27] you promised this I I can't be able to
[1:18:29] live this I can't fulfill this you
[1:18:32] promise be it unto
[1:18:33] me according to your word fulfill your
[1:18:37] word in me it's it's it's a beautiful
[1:18:40] it's just a beautiful relationship where
[1:18:44] we can rest on the Lord that is the
[1:18:47] secret of the Christian faith
[1:18:51] rest that's the secret of the Christian
[1:18:54] faith
[1:18:57] rest praise the lord it's it's it's one
[1:19:01] of the two and when you are working God
[1:19:03] can't work he has to
[1:19:05] rest amen if you can take rest in his
[1:19:09] promise you can put God to
[1:19:12] work he will send angels on your behalf
[1:19:15] amen and when you are resting in his
[1:19:17] promise he will send angel on your
[1:19:19] behalf
[1:19:25] praise the
[1:19:27] Lord I mean what what a what an
[1:19:30] inspiration to know that is the Lord
[1:19:33] that is
[1:19:34] drawing he's the one that is
[1:19:37] drawing he's the one that is bringing us
[1:19:41] closer praise the Lord he's the one that
[1:19:44] is creating this desire in us to live
[1:19:48] right the desire to tell the
[1:19:51] truth the desire to confess our sins
[1:19:58] praise the
[1:20:00] Lord just to know that he is the one
[1:20:03] that is working mightily in
[1:20:12] US draw me nearer
[1:20:14] amen draw me nearer nearer blessed
[1:20:18] Lord are we together now listening to
[1:20:21] this I read this morning and I'll close
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:37] here
[1:20:39] amen and uh uh uh Paul says something
[1:20:43] here let's go back to that I was going
[1:20:45] to read something but uh I want to go
[1:20:48] back to that uh
[1:20:58] look at this look at this uh this
[1:21:00] setting right here draw nigh to God and
[1:21:03] He will draw nigh to you cleanse your
[1:21:06] hands yeah Sinner and purify your heart
[1:21:09] yeah double minded now uh uh uh as I was
[1:21:14] as I was just meditating on this like I
[1:21:16] said uh
[1:21:19] uh what what came to my
[1:21:22] mind you know what came to to my mind uh
[1:21:25] as I was thinking on this is that see
[1:21:29] how the the
[1:21:31] Apostle
[1:21:32] James you know like I said words words
[1:21:37] amazing in Translation the effect of uh
[1:21:40] what a person say sometimes can be
[1:21:43] missing in Translation
[1:21:45] but if you just think about this this
[1:21:48] way
[1:21:50] now the Bible talking about uh you know
[1:21:53] wash your hands your Sinners purify your
[1:21:56] heart your double
[1:21:57] minded he says draw night unto the Lord
[1:22:01] and He will draw night unto
[1:22:02] you now in one way you can look at it
[1:22:06] for me to draw night to the Lord I need
[1:22:08] to cleanse my hands the Bible says I'mma
[1:22:10] cleanse my hands the Bible say I'mma
[1:22:12] cleanse my heart praise the Lord if you
[1:22:15] look at it that way it's becoming your
[1:22:20] works praise the lord it's becoming your
[1:22:23] works now now if we look at it as he's
[1:22:26] the one that is drawing us if he's doing
[1:22:30] the drawing then he have to do the
[1:22:32] cleansing and he has to do the purifying
[1:22:35] of our
[1:22:39] hearts praise the
[1:22:41] Lord because in in in in in many in many
[1:22:44] places that's where uh most time you
[1:22:47] know people try to practice
[1:22:49] religion if I can do this you know if I
[1:22:52] can do that if I can do this and then at
[1:22:55] the end when it gets to the place of all
[1:22:58] the effort that is put in and they still
[1:23:01] see themsel laboring on a habit
[1:23:04] struggling with things in their life
[1:23:06] then th Old Devil tell them you see this
[1:23:09] thing is not true nobody can live it
[1:23:12] nobody can live the word of
[1:23:15] God praise the Lord nobody can live it
[1:23:18] because it's not man's words but the god
[1:23:22] that said it he can perform it the god
[1:23:25] that said he can bring it to
[1:23:31] pass are we
[1:23:34] together but there's a beautiful H uh uh
[1:23:38] uh uh levitical preaching that is set up
[1:23:41] here you realize that uh you know uh uh
[1:23:45] that's that's what the Old Testament
[1:23:47] priest would do just before they come to
[1:23:50] minister
[1:23:52] him just before they they get to
[1:23:54] ministering there is a lava there they
[1:23:57] had to go and washed wash their hands
[1:24:00] and wash their feet just before they can
[1:24:03] go into the the the Tabernacle to start
[1:24:06] offering sacrifice unto the
[1:24:09] Lord praise the Lord
[1:24:12] amen James in another way bringing
[1:24:15] bringing bringing that blessing to
[1:24:18] us you know that when he when he when he
[1:24:22] draw us when he's when he's dealing with
[1:24:24] with us is not just to have us to be
[1:24:27] there but he want to take us into the
[1:24:30] holy place he want to take us into
[1:24:34] service because when the priest gets to
[1:24:36] the Tabernacle he just just don't get
[1:24:39] there to stand around and be looking
[1:24:41] around no he have to go into service and
[1:24:44] how do he get into service wash his
[1:24:47] hands he wash his
[1:24:50] feet he confess his sins and the sin of
[1:24:53] the people
[1:24:55] and then he goes
[1:24:57] into offering sacrifice the sprinkling
[1:25:00] of the
[1:25:02] blood the the the sprinkling of uh the
[1:25:06] water of Separation then he goes into
[1:25:08] all there are we together now brother
[1:25:12] brandham said this this is the second
[1:25:13] thing I wanted to read to you from the
[1:25:15] same message he says he says what if a
[1:25:19] baby before it was born
[1:25:25] let's take that a baby a little baby
[1:25:28] that live in the womb of the
[1:25:31] mother for these nine
[1:25:34] months and that little baby could
[1:25:39] think it would
[1:25:41] say you know what they tell me I'm
[1:25:47] fixing to be born well what will what
[1:25:52] will I do out there I don't
[1:25:55] know I don't know nothing but nothing

[1:26:06] this place that I live which mean I
[1:26:08] don't know nothing about out there only

[1:26:46] mother here's
[1:26:49] word I was brought in years all I know
[1:26:53] is right in this W and they tell
[1:26:57] me
[1:26:58] that there's just room times wrong which
[1:27:03] mean out there is a bigger space than
[1:27:06] just this place where I am praise the
[1:27:09] Lord I can hear the voices of the people
[1:27:11] but I don't know what they are doing I
[1:27:14] can hear noises but I don't know what's
[1:27:15] going on praise the
[1:27:18] Lord now he's he set in the same year
[1:27:22] now you have to know now the the the the
[1:27:24] whole thing that is behind this message

[1:27:41] Ready to the church so that's where all
[1:27:44] of this is coming from now he's talking
[1:27:46] about that place in comparing to this
[1:27:48] place praise the Lord are we together
[1:27:55] well that little baby will be scared to
[1:27:59] death to be born because they don't know

[1:28:44] you know whatever she feels that's what
[1:28:46] I feel I don't know how I'm going to
[1:28:48] survive that brother B say she's going
[1:28:49] to be scared to
[1:28:51] death praise the Lord
[1:28:54] cuz it's coming into a place to know
[1:28:58] nothing about the child is coming into a
[1:29:00] place to know which is supreme million
[1:29:04] of times Supreme to word is being
[1:29:07] living it it wouldn't know what it's all
[1:29:11] about it it says
[1:29:14] how what am I going to do it it be

[1:29:24] we that are back there one time we we
[1:29:29] who by no means go back there so what
[1:29:33] he's saying we we we were once in a womb
[1:29:37] we have come we have experience the
[1:29:41] space we don't want to go back to the
[1:29:44] wom amen the child that have not come

[1:29:53] know know there is a continent I mean uh
[1:29:56] I mean the baby don't have to use
[1:29:58] vehicle there but we use vehicle here we
[1:30:00] see the space we don't want to go back
[1:30:02] to that small place
[1:30:04] again are we together praise the Lord
[1:30:08] now he's going to he's going to he's
[1:30:10] he's he's comparing it between going you

[1:30:16] what the the the the the the blessing
[1:30:18] that is waiting for us on the other side
[1:30:21] but also in a sense he's comparing it to
[1:30:24] to to to our birth when when we have
[1:30:27] when we have uh uh you know get away
[1:30:31] from relying on our strength and our
[1:30:33] effort and you know we can we can trust

[1:31:05] and and brother Brandon I mean and
[1:31:07] that's what Jesus you know trying to
[1:31:11] bring to
[1:31:12] Nicodemus you know that you know if you
[1:31:14] are born again you know you will
[1:31:17] understand super natural thing you hon
[1:31:19] understand spiritual things say how can
[1:31:21] a man be born do I have to go back into
[1:31:23] to my mother's womb amen and you realize
[1:31:27] uh uh through the Through the Ages that
[1:31:29] is the thing that have caused
[1:31:31] denomination because people has been
[1:31:33] going back to their old womb they've
[1:31:35] been going back to their old
[1:31:38] system praise the Lord and with the move
[1:31:41] of God he take us from glory to glory
[1:31:46] From Grace to Grace the prophet said
[1:31:49] that's why people are afraid of the new
[1:31:51] birth because they don't know what to
[1:31:52] expect they they don't want to add funny
[1:31:55] they don't want to shout you know that
[1:31:57] they they grew up in a very quiet Church
[1:31:59] you know and uh you know very quiet they
[1:32:01] do their sign of the cross you know
[1:32:03] their services are shot you know and
[1:32:06] they don't want to get to the experience
[1:32:07] where they just break out and shout and
[1:32:09] dancing in their Spirit they don't want
[1:32:10] to do that they don't know what to
[1:32:14] expect praise the Lord but you and
[1:32:17] myself that have been
[1:32:19] there amen and we have break through
[1:32:22] into this joy of the Lord Lord
[1:32:25] hallelujah what a good feeling when the
[1:32:27] word just stimulates you amen sometimes
[1:32:31] you don't even know how it comes it just
[1:32:33] comes through you when you
[1:32:35] shout praise the Lord you know how it
[1:32:38] feels when you just sit there in the
[1:32:40] service and nothing really stimulates
[1:32:42] you you just feel so so dried and so
[1:32:46] dull because you want you want a
[1:32:48] connection with the word he wants
[1:32:50] something to be said that will that will
[1:32:52] connect with something in you
[1:32:54] praise the lord it's a different
[1:32:57] feeling we don't want to go back to that
[1:33:00] dead experience anymore praise the lord
[1:33:03] we don't want to go back and and that's
[1:33:05] how the Lord draw us he draw us to more
[1:33:09] and more and more and more of his
[1:33:13] presence praise the Lord our
[1:33:16] understanding comes you know uh just
[1:33:19] from ourself just from our church just
[1:33:22] from legalizing we we start to
[1:33:25] understand this is a bigger
[1:33:27] picture it's not all about
[1:33:31] me it's all about
[1:33:33] him and in him is more than me praise
[1:33:37] the Lord in him is more than
[1:33:42] me praise the
[1:33:44] Lord
[1:33:47] hallelujah so you see there a beautiful
[1:33:49] picture here he says uh he goes on he
[1:33:52] say it's a million time million times of
[1:33:54] praying to where we've been living it
[1:33:58] wouldn't know what it's all about that
[1:34:01] little baby wouldn't know how what am I
[1:34:04] going to do it it be scared to death to
[1:34:07] be born but we who live out here well we
[1:34:11] that was once back there we who by no
[1:34:15] means go back we wouldn't want to go
[1:34:18] back into mother's womb again no we
[1:34:21] wouldn't want to do that
[1:34:24] praise the Lord and and that's just the
[1:34:28] way it is when we are dying
[1:34:32] friends oh God see we are being born
[1:34:36] into a place praise the Lord so death
[1:34:40] for us in this body is birth into
[1:34:43] another place praise the Lord
[1:34:50] amen you have been born into a place you
[1:34:53] have never been there you couldn't
[1:34:56] understand it how great it
[1:35:00] is how is going to be out there we think
[1:35:04] about a streets of God we think about
[1:35:09] Mansions the only idea we have is the
[1:35:12] Mansions we see here we don't know how
[1:35:14] the Mansions going to be praise the Lord
[1:35:17] when we think about streets of God we
[1:35:19] look at our streets that's the picture
[1:35:21] that come to our mind we say well it
[1:35:24] might not be black because it's gold it
[1:35:26] might be you know uh in a gold color
[1:35:29] that's the picture that come to our mind
[1:35:31] because we have never been
[1:35:33] there all everything we can imagine
[1:35:36] about
[1:35:37] heaven we relate it to something around
[1:35:41] us praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:35:45] yet we cannot appreciate a thousand
[1:35:47] years because how long have we
[1:35:51] Liv we have not hit 100 yet
[1:35:55] then you thinking about
[1:35:58] thousand are we
[1:36:01] together so we don't know what to what
[1:36:04] you know what to expect you see and and
[1:36:07] like the Apostle says I have not seen
[1:36:10] ears have not heard neither have it come
[1:36:14] close to our heart in everything that we
[1:36:17] know it about heaven we have not got
[1:36:20] close to what the reality is
[1:36:25] just like that baby in the womb have not
[1:36:28] got
[1:36:29] close to what the reality of living on
[1:36:32] Earth we have not got close you see and
[1:36:36] that's the reason why the devil can use
[1:36:39] our
[1:36:41] struggle to make us to think that it's
[1:36:44] it's not real
[1:36:47] amen when we going
[1:36:49] through different things sickness in our
[1:36:52] body and and different things we are
[1:36:54] dealing with all he's trying to do is to
[1:36:57] kill the reality of Heaven in our
[1:37:05] mind so just make us believe it's all
[1:37:08] yeah it's it's it's just here it's just
[1:37:11] here there is there is nothing real to
[1:37:14] that oh but there is there is a
[1:37:16] substance of faith in our heart amen
[1:37:19] praise the
[1:37:21] lord we feed this
[1:37:26] courage we fall down we make mistakes
[1:37:30] but there is a supernal thing in our
[1:37:33] heart praise the Lord that picks us
[1:37:40] up and then we we we we we keep on on
[1:37:43] the joining we keep going to that City
[1:37:46] praise the Lord is moving us to that
[1:37:50] city are we together
[1:37:55] the only
[1:37:58] thing that makes me
[1:38:02] realize or you
[1:38:05] realize is that little touch of
[1:38:08] life like the spirit comes into the baby
[1:38:12] in his mother's wom see is the only way
[1:38:16] that we can understand what is that
[1:38:20] great land out y
[1:38:26] when there's no sickness no sorrow no
[1:38:28] death no oish nothing oh my is that
[1:38:32] little that little touch of Life praise
[1:38:35] the Lord that little touch of
[1:38:40] life it just anoint our
[1:38:44] heart it just create
[1:38:47] faith we are in all of these pains but
[1:38:50] yet we can tell ourself I will be okay
[1:38:55] that little touch of
[1:38:57] life because the baby has life even
[1:39:01] though she don't know what is happening
[1:39:04] outside but she's
[1:39:07] kicking praise the Lord she's kicking
[1:39:10] sometimes she hear loud noise she gets
[1:39:13] afraid you know sign signs proof that
[1:39:17] you know children born in abusive home
