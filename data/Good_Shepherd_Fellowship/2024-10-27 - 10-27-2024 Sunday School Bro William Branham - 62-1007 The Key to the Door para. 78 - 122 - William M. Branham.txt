[Music] [Applause] [Music] things on her back and he looked around again [Music] personally uh testimony I remember about 15 17 years years ago now about when the Lord said to me down there on the river when he came down in that Pillar of Fire whose picture you see and he spoke to me and he said you're to take this message around the world I remember at Greens Mill when he spoke to me and I went and told the pastor and he told me he said bil what did you eat that night you had a nightmare he said go on back to your job you're working at the Public Service Company got a good job go on back and take care of your your business son said you had a nightmare you eat something that didn't phase me one bit amen when I started out for the healing Services many of you here remember my message that morning as David went to meet Goliath I preached on and they told me he said in the day of modern science when we have got all kinds of medic research when we've got the best doctors when the church has long forgot Divine Healing and stuff from many many years ago how are you going before a great giant like that amen how are you going to walk out in the face of the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian and so forth and even the Pentecostals who has forgotten a long time ago and went into their Creeds how you go to face with no denomination nothing else to back you up what are you going to do Bill somehow and another it didn't phase me one bit for I help in my hand a [Music] key I said they said nobody will believe you you won't be able to do it nobody believe you I said I don't care there's one thing sure God called me and I must go because God called me Hallelujah I held the key he had called me he had showed me he had told me and I saw his presence when he commissioned me and the key was there amen the Pastor said with the seventh grade education and you're going to preach and pray before Kings and monarchs I said that's a according to his word about this time last year or a week or two before when i' come to the church and told you that the Lord God had giving me a vision of go taking a hunting trip and a certain animal I was going to find that going to have 42 in horns on it and on the road back from getting this animal where it would be laying in the position it would be in on the road back I was going to kill a silver tip grizzly bear and I went to this certain section and I spoke to the man and he said I don't know of any animal it looks like like that and as far as a grizzly bear I've never seen one I said but somewhere it's got to be here so he said we're not even going into be country we're going up for sheep way up above Timberline while I went with him in the second day out in the very spot exactly where the Lord said there laid the animal amen so when I went and got the animal and while we were uh taking the skin and the horns and so forth off he said I want to ask you something you told me 3 days ago when we left the the camp that after you had shot this certain Beast that on the road back you was going to kill a silver tip grizzly bear I said that's thus say the Lord hallelujah said I'm not doubting he said because my brother was an epileptic and you've never seen him in your life when he was up here one time and you told me that boy was going to be healed when I done a certain thing and he was he said now but brother brandom I want to ask you he said I can see all the way down that mountain to where the Timberline is them horses are understanding and there's nothing there there isn't a speck of grass there isn't a rock there isn't nothing Caribou Moss which is about 2 Ines high on above Timber lines for a mile or more above the Timberline said where is the bear going to be I said God is Jehovah gy hallah if he's told me there will be a bear there there'll be one there down the mountain about every time we get a half a mile or so closer he said brother brandom not time for that bear to appear I said don't worry he'll be here and when we were almost within about 500 yards of where the horses was we had to rest again with the heavy horns and things on her back and he looked around again and I seen his face as he looked at me as if down in his heart he was wondering see he had hope it would be there but he didn't have the key but somehow amen by the grace of God he's never failed me when he told me there' be a silver tip there I had to key I didn't doubt it one bit not a bit I turned to him and I said bud it'll be there and just as I turned there was a there standing right above us about a half a mile he thr the glasses on he said Billy Soul help me it's a big Silver Tip amen see the key of vision the word of the Lord amen there's nothing can change it or stop it what the church needs tonight is not an educ what the church needs tonight is not a denomination what the church needs tonight is not a Creed what the church needs tonight is the key to the scriptures the door which Christ is the door and he is the [Music] word faith in the word of the Living God unlocks every door yes amen God give us the key give us a key Hebrews the 12th chapter says seeing that we're compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the unbelief that does so easily beset us it says sin which sin is unbelief only one sin that's unbelief and sin means to miss the mark like you're shooting you miss the mark better adjust your gun see because there's something wrong you miss the art see come back and try over sin means to turn around you've missed the mark yeah when you want to be a Christian and you go join the church you miss the Mark when you want to be a Christian and you've been sprinkled in the name of the father son Holy Ghost you missed the mark but come back you'll not be on the target you'll scatter as sure as the world there's only one thing can hold you in perfect line that's the scripture the Bible the word for both heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away so hold the key faith in the word and every bit of faith that you believe and don't doubt One spec you can unlock every door that stands between you and the blessing that God has for you may God help us to have the keys is my prayer let's bow our heads now for our word of prayer our heavenly father we thank thee tonight that thou has give us a key to unlock to us salvation I I thank you for that Lord that we are saved and for the key that we have been able to use so far but God give us faith that every one of these words wrote in your book is little levers and this key called Jesus this door I mean called Jesus and the key called Faith touches every word it unlocks it it moves that little lever down and we can enter into that blessing Heavenly Father give to us the keys that we might be able to have faith in the promises of God that our faith might not fail that we might be able to be a service to you and to those who we associate with forgive every sin of our disbelieving Lord and help us to be thine we're coming now to the communion table now I pray heavenly father that you will forgive us of all of our trespasses that we might be able to enter into the joy of Fellowship around the table of God we ask it in Jesus name amen my brother sister if if you got the key to the kingdom the key to the door the key of Salvation God help you to open the doors and Let Jesus come in amen let him give to you the things that you so so desire now just a moment before we start to read on communion I want to say a thing because it's on communion and when we come to this altar there's only one way to come that is if we hold a key of faith in our hands it lets us know that our sins are forgiven and if we don't have that key to unlock that door that our sins are forgiven we have no business at the table of the Lord because he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body now that is true I guess all of us know that today is the national Comm communion day this is the day that all churches take communion it's the national communion day over the nation and I thought that it would be appropriate to speak a word or two on communion before we tuck it while the pastor if you will be getting the scriptures ready for the reading of the the order of the Lord's table amen now this communion now I won't take but just about 10 minutes this communion that we're fixing to take has been the greatest dispute of any Doctrine in the Bible that was their one of their first disputes in the early church and today the Protestant of uh Episcopalian and Methodist and many other Protestant churches would gladly accept Catholic Roman Catholic Doctrine if they could get over the little hump of communion but they will agree that the priest should be married and be ministers the Catholic Church agreed on that several times in their conferences and meetings they agree on it and they'll agree upon different uh uh prayers and so forth the Protestant church will agree upon it and the cisms and so forth the little altar here and there and the Catholic church is willing to do it but but when it come to the communion there they fell now anybody that's ever read history knows that of course to my way of thinking they'd have a lot to get away from for I can accept it you see because it isn't Bible but I want you to say one thing to the Catholic church do you know the Catholic church in the beginning was the Apostolic Pentecostal Church certainly was it was the first beginning of the church and you see where they all they got to they kept taking away the word and injecting a dogma and if the Pentecostal church should exist another hundred years it would be farther off of the Bible than the Catholic church is today from the way it's going now it took the Catholic Church several hundred years to get away from it 300 years from the early church to the organizing of the Roman Catholic Church which they started out and they caught bringing in big dignitaries and things and they cut out this and put in this and taking out this and put up that and taking down Pagan idols and put up Christian statues and so forth and just compromising on that till they come to what they got now the Roman Catholic church and the Protestant Pentecostal Church from the the 50 years that it's been in existence and where it's fell from where it started it'll be a worse shape in the Catholic Church than 100 years from now that's right that's a big word to say but just look where theyve fallen from they went right into organization they went right in compromising on this and that and everything else and there they go see going right back but communion is called the Lord's supper now a lot of people they want to take it in the morning didn't say in the Bible it was his breakfast and how these people today how they can still say Lord supper and they don't they've cut out supper and omitted it and called it dinner nonsense supper now always a dispute in the Bible times it was a dispute then the people misunderstood the Lord's Supper when they come to the table Paul told those Corinthians they were coming and getting drunk at the Lord's table see it was misunderstood right then he said if you want to eat eat at home and another thing he was misund understood what it was h a Sinners and man living in sin come and Tuck the communion that was misunderstood a man living with his mother Foster mother and the church had told him about it still taking communion at the table and there were divisions among them and they were still taking communion he said I understand you walk like the rest of Gentiles and there's there's conviction among you like there is at at uh especially in sas's house and so forth said you walk like the rest of the Gentiles see it was misunderstood the communion has always been misunderstood now I could go on for that for hours but we got to get this communion and the feet washing now they've simply omitted feet washing allog together just a few of the denominations a lot of the Pentecostals has got completely away from it see and it's still in the Bible just the way it was wrote see now Rome does not call it communion they call it Mass it's a Holy Mass they don't take communion they take a mass it's a mass and a mass certainly takes the real meaning from communion a mass means hoping they take a mass hoping that in doing this in the mass that God will for forgive them of their sins by taking the literal Body of Christ which the priest turns from to the body and the blood of Christ taking that hoping that God will omit their sins by doing so it's a mass the Protestants call it communion communion means Thanksgiving that the Protestant the Catholic is taking a mass in the mass hoping that God forgives them are there evil doing the Protestant takes it with Thanksgiving for what's already done with a communion with God communing with him that it's already done the Catholic is hoping it's done the Protestant says it's already done the Catholic is wondering if his sins is Forgiven the Protestant is confessing that they are forgiven amen that he is free and a communion is communing with God and these articles that we take not in hopes that our sins are forgiven but they are forgiven because it's one is Hope and the other is Faith one's hoping he's right and the other knows he's right the other wants hoping because he don't know where he stands the other knows he's right because he knows what God Said Amen that's it that's the difference so when you're just hoping be careful but when you know then go on see then you're in communion with God Protestant is he says he's forgiven and he knows it the Catholic has mass hope hopes that he'll be forgiven it's just like this one is a beggar hoping that everything's all right see the other is a beggar thanking for what's already been done they're both Beggars but one's begging hoping he'll get it the other beggar knows he's got it and thank him for giving it to him now there's the difference that's community amen yes sir one is uh hoping that he's forgiven the other knows he's forgiven and giv thanks for it so communion is for Christians that's born again of the spirit of God and Born Again does not necessarily mean now that you got the Holy Ghost now remember now many teach that I don't know anybody teaches it like this old brother argb said that night to the pool years see but New Birth is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't support it I don't think see the my way of seeing it see I believe that you're born again and that's reason I do use the word baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but not to Regeneration now the Pentecostal and United Pentecostal Church baptizes in the name of Jesus Christ for a regeneration I don't believe that that they can do it if they want to but I believe Peter said repent first water don't remit sins the Church of Christ preaches it that way but I believe that repentance Godly sorrow repent means turn around go back you miss some Mar start over again do that first and your baptism in water is only an outward profession of something that's been done inside of you that you have accepted Christ as your savior I guess it's just a church here tonight as far as I know I'm not here enough to know who does come or not I got a little criticism here not long ago on baptizing a man here in the pool an old fell and I went to him as good old man I had the privilege of leading all his family to Christ all of them Christians this old man was a nice old man and I like so I went to him and I said to him Papa why don't you become a Christian he's loves me he said brother brandom I would become a Christian when I can get good enough I said tell you what you do Papa you look all around and you find where you can get good enough then tell me where that place is I want to go to amen I said Christ never come to save good man he come to to save bad man amen when you think you're good then he didn't come to save you he come to save them he knows they're bad Christ died to save Sinners and I said papa there's a line right here he said well I smoke these cigarettes I said I ain't going to even talk about them he said I'll try to give them up brother Bram I said I we ain't going to talk about cigarettes he said well when I can I said don't don't say no more about him let him go I want to ask you a question he said right what is it I said Do you believe there is a God said certainly I believe it said I believe that as strong as you do gu brother brandham I said do you believe that that same God crossed this stream and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ in order to save man he said yes I believe that and he died to save Sinners Like You are like I am yes I believe that I said now it's just like this we're all in one big building over here and we're in jail and I can't stand over in this corner and say this will help me get out of jail I stand over in that corner say that'll help me get out of jail we're all in the same fix and every man that was born in this world was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he's a renegade to begin with [Music] for
