[37:26] and they also enjoy The Fellowship of
[37:29] the Saints after after service all those
[37:32] that hang around to fellowship with them
[37:36] and you see there's uh there's a
[37:38] blessing to uh the the people of God you
[37:43] know just like I said you we we
[37:46] encourage a preacher you know when when
[37:49] when
[37:51] God send a preacher our way uh is it is
[37:56] a big encouragement to be able to
[37:58] receive from uh from uh from that from
[38:01] their Ministry so I believe our brother
[38:04] was very encouraged uh he enjoyed the
[38:07] worship he enjoyed the the response to
[38:09] the word he enjoyed also uh
[38:14] preaching to you
[38:16] so we pray that the Lord will just
[38:20] a bless of musicians God bless you you
[38:22] can have your seat we will do singing if
[38:25] we have time at the end of the service
[38:28] hearing that uh
[38:31] about our brother
[38:34] George passing the kind of a true me off
[38:37] a little bit
[38:42] but uh there are a few things I would
[38:43] want to go over before I just go into
[38:46] the word
[38:47] that we want to something we want to
[38:50] speak on tonight
[38:51] [Music]
[38:52] brother Branham said this uh uh in the
[38:56] message in the invisible Union
[39:00] I want to start with this and uh
[39:03] for the service tonight and it's a
[39:05] prayer meeting if I if I'll get through
[39:08] it okay then I will go into what I want
[39:10] to speak because it's not really uh just
[39:13] something to encourage you but uh uh
[39:18] um
[39:21] and before I go into that the the
[39:24] deacons uh uh been sharing concern and
[39:27] wanted to remind us of our service time
[39:31] uh and uh they wanted us to be reminded
[39:36] for us to
[39:38] uh return back or remind ourselves of
[39:42] remembering the service time you know on
[39:45] Wednesday night the church is open at
[39:48] seven o'clock some self is supposed to
[39:50] be at 7 30 and they want to remind us so
[39:55] we can we can be able to to go now
[39:58] listening to to uh to that I mean they
[40:02] were kind of for talking they had a uh
[40:06] reminding me on that and especially on
[40:09] Sunday also
[40:11] uh the service time is 10 o'clock
[40:13] that's when the service is open we're
[40:16] supposed to have a time of prayer just
[40:19] before the the Sunday School tape comes
[40:22] on now those things are very important
[40:25] and uh especially what uh what I want to
[40:28] read here and I I was thinking on that
[40:31] and I was just saying Lord uh I don't
[40:34] believe it is it is time for us to to
[40:37] scare you or whip you into that I don't
[40:41] think that's the way it's supposed to be
[40:43] it's supposed to be something that you
[40:46] be live out we must we must be quick
[40:49] into death we must we must we must be
[40:52] catch up with that if we have to come
[40:54] and then start to uh make a sermon out
[40:57] of it and run behind you you know let's
[41:00] come to church on time then there is
[41:02] just something wrong with that picture
[41:06] so like brother Branham said yeah he
[41:08] says but watch when their spiritual
[41:10] bride when she begins to have a Revival
[41:15] when she begins to come back
[41:19] in line herself up with the word so you
[41:23] see the bride Revival
[41:25] is her lining up with the word
[41:29] praise the Lord
[41:31] if we are not lining up with the word
[41:34] uh the the Revival the church Revival is
[41:38] where we you know we uh uh we we put
[41:43] Bibles on the street we paint pictures
[41:46] up we you know put two preachers there
[41:49] Dynamic explosive Revival you know and
[41:53] that's the church Revival
[41:56] but the bride's Revival is when she's
[42:00] lining up with the word
[42:02] praise the Lord
[42:04] in every aspect of our life
[42:07] not only church ordered
[42:09] in every aspect of our life
[42:13] now so listen to this watch when when
[42:16] the spiritual bride when she begins to
[42:18] have a Revival
[42:20] when she begins to come back
[42:23] and line herself up with the word wash
[42:27] then again you see
[42:29] how that the scripture at that time
[42:32] there will be a message
[42:36] sweep out to catch that brine
[42:39] catch that woman
[42:42] praise the Lord
[42:44] and that will be
[42:46] a raptury message
[42:49] in another sense it is when the message
[42:52] now starts becoming quick into you
[42:57] you are on the expectation
[43:01] praise the Lord
[43:03] he says for as the word Satan the
[43:06] deceiver who deceived the first bride to
[43:10] sinning against God
[43:12] by misbelieving his word now listen to
[43:16] this and now today as we see the church
[43:20] natural
[43:21] in your intellectual gospel
[43:26] praise the Lord
[43:28] and there and and we we cannot Ascend
[43:32] ourselves from this there's a bunch of
[43:34] intellectual approach around the message
[43:39] we know the courts we know the scripture
[43:43] we can we can give one court and we can
[43:46] counteract it with another Court
[43:49] and all of those things can just be
[43:51] intellectual
[43:53] we can defend our position while we are
[43:57] doing what we are doing we can find a
[43:59] Bible verse we can find the code and
[44:02] defend that and yet it can be just from
[44:05] an intellectual standpoint
[44:10] praise the Lord
[44:12] now but you see uh just before that you
[44:15] have to see your brother Branham before
[44:17] bringing that intellectual he make us to
[44:20] to say he says what what Satan that
[44:24] deceiver who deceive the first bride by
[44:26] sinning against God but
[44:30] misbelieving his word
[44:35] praise the Lord
[44:37] so the position of an intellectual Fair
[44:41] is that you can have all the reasoning
[44:44] of the word and give yourself reason why
[44:47] you should do certain things and yet you
[44:50] are misbelieving God's word
[44:56] because what what is the approach of the
[44:59] enemy
[45:00] is to take the effect of the word
[45:04] when if he can take the effect of the
[45:06] word you can stay with all the knowledge
[45:08] of the word
[45:10] but there is no power to bring forth
[45:13] life
[45:22] he says so the church natural in your
[45:24] intellectual Faith Glory father and
[45:27] father away from the word
[45:31] in Social Gospel
[45:33] we find that the the women of the word
[45:36] on the on the street
[45:41] members of such is caring themselves in
[45:46] some atmosphere
[45:48] you can't tell them they have they have
[45:51] lost all sense of common defensing
[45:55] the people have in all
[45:58] and that's the way the church has
[46:03] and you can see it's going straight to
[46:06] the in communica Council
[46:09] just as soon as anything in the world
[46:12] all right into Rome as hard as it can go
[46:18] cause it's prophesied and there she is
[46:22] that's her behavior but then watch again
[46:26] to the spiritual church how that group
[46:30] of people call out elected true every
[46:34] Revival
[46:35] in Martin Luther's is it happens the
[46:38] same way in the Reformation it happened
[46:41] the same way in the time of John John
[46:44] Wesley it happened the the same thing
[46:47] when Pentecostal first started
[46:50] they dropped them women right back in
[46:53] line with the word
[46:55] and then they'd Drift Away
[47:00] there she goes right back over into
[47:04] chaos
[47:05] but then the time that the people are
[47:09] ready to line up there is a message come
[47:13] from now so you see it is we're not
[47:15] looking for them not a messenger praise
[47:18] the Lord there is not another messenger
[47:20] order not a message coming forth but
[47:22] what is happening in this in this
[47:24] condition is that when we start lining
[47:27] up with the word then the word starts
[47:30] becoming real to you
[47:32] the words that becoming person to you
[47:36] because the promise in this age is that
[47:39] it has to be Christ in bright form
[47:43] so is the word picking on your flesh
[47:46] once again
[47:48] is you rising up to a faith where you
[47:51] can you can speak and believe that it
[47:53] will happen
[47:56] if you are not lining up with the word
[47:58] it is just intellectual
[48:06] praise the Lord
[48:14] Luther was the messenger of one day
[48:16] justification in the church lying right
[48:19] with it some of them the rest of them
[48:22] continue on Wesley come with
[48:25] sanctification the church lying rights
[48:27] with a Pentecostal come with the
[48:29] restoration of the gift the church line
[48:31] and every time they line up with the
[48:34] word they got the result of the word
[48:38] regard the result of the word
[48:44] praise the Lord
[48:46] how can I overcome brother Branham says
[48:48] how can we overcome he says is to keep
[48:51] life
[48:54] right amen
[48:55] he says if we are not keeping to the
[48:58] life of the word we are just like that
[49:00] uh dead Lock you know he talked about
[49:03] the dead lock that looks so big but
[49:07] everything inside has been eaten up
[49:10] he says that just I will be you see so
[49:13] that's how we keep uh uh uh life and and
[49:17] and that's how we also keep the revival
[49:20] going is to line up
[49:22] we have to we have to we have to watch
[49:25] ourselves we have to remember
[49:28] in the preview of the Bride that was how
[49:31] that Vision ended
[49:33] by the sounding of stay in line because
[49:37] that's your Revival your Revival is to
[49:40] stay in line
[49:42] and what the enemy will fight against is
[49:45] to take you out of line
[49:50] praise the Lord
[49:52] that's the reason why it's not going to
[49:54] be a public show
[49:57] it's not going to be a public show it's
[50:00] going to be you as an individual
[50:03] staying in line with the world
[50:06] in every aspect of our life
[50:10] so even as a church we have to realize
[50:13] that
[50:16] if we want if we want to to have a
[50:20] Revival
[50:21] if we want to have and and and I would
[50:24] say is the other uh uh the Lord has
[50:27] blessed us
[50:28] you know the Lord has blessed us but yet
[50:31] uh
[50:33] you know we cannot we can add for our
[50:36] hands we cannot knock our chest for that
[50:39] we have to improve
[50:44] you know all all of the brothers that
[50:46] come and preach here they really enjoyed
[50:49] preaching to you
[50:51] and walks makes a church responsive is
[50:54] when you are in the word
[50:57] praise the Lord
[50:58] and when you are in the word you are
[51:01] studying the word you are listening to
[51:03] the tapes you are praying up you know uh
[51:06] uh it it it takes the preacher out of
[51:09] his notes
[51:14] a preacher can feed it
[51:17] he can feed it when the people are
[51:20] paying attention he can feed it when the
[51:22] people are in the subject
[51:25] he can also feed it when the people are
[51:28] distracted
[51:50] Pentacles come with the restoration of
[51:52] the gift the church line right with it
[51:57] the elite of that day
[51:59] and then fade away
[52:02] went right back off in denominationalism
[52:06] and went right out with the rest of them
[52:11] all of them write down along the line
[52:16] now but you notice when the people begin
[52:20] to try to line with the word there come
[52:24] a fresh message
[52:27] from the word of God rise straight to
[52:29] the people
[52:30] and they catch that message and line up
[52:34] every time is just
[52:36] it's just in God's we we have that
[52:40] we have family every family in year is
[52:44] custom to that
[52:46] sometimes everything will run fine for
[52:50] you for years
[52:51] then all at once you will hit a spell
[52:55] where you said uh uh we say it many
[53:00] times in the South when it rains it
[53:02] falls
[53:03] and everything goes wrong
[53:07] you are going through a nighttime then
[53:11] there's a day break
[53:14] then at night time everything runs in
[53:19] come Trinity praise the Lord
[53:22] and uh
[53:25] God gave no of his This Promise
[53:31] I would just I was just talking to uh a
[53:35] brother and we were we were talking
[53:37] something this morning and I remember
[53:40] this uh you know when I was we were kind
[53:44] of for fellowshipping and I was trying

[53:59] remaineth see time Harvest Time cold
[54:03] heat summer winter
[54:07] and day and night shall not cease so

[54:12] brother Branham is saying here we go
[54:14] through those Seasons we go through
[54:16] those spells
[54:19] you know but we have to know
[54:22] we have to know

[54:46] that it is it is it is uh it is a
[54:49] constant it is a constant struggle you

[54:55] left every time you try to keep it right

[55:01] house and then before you come back
[55:03] again everything is out of order you got
[55:05] to put things back in order you know
[55:07] that is just a physical sign of how
[55:09] things goes in our spirit man
[55:12] praise the Lord so we have to be
[55:15] conscious of that
[55:17] amen let's let's turn tonight to uh

[56:39] pray one for another that ye may be
[56:43] healed

[57:57] chapter 10.
[58:00] so uh tonight I want to take you know
[58:03] we've been talking on uh there are more
[58:05] righteous than ah we we went and looked
[58:09] at Abraham uh uh that was also uh God
[58:14] promising great and exceeding reward we
[58:18] were looking at uh that which uh the
[58:22] righteousness that exceed the
[58:24] righteousness of the strap and Pharisees
[58:26] so we were looking at that that sense of
[58:29] exceeding you know Paul used it now that
[58:33] is under the same language when brother
[58:34] Branham talks about super Faith he talks
[58:37] about super sign he talks about super is
[58:41] exceeding you know abundant
[58:44] yeah there was nothing to to create
[58:47] another race
[58:49] no it was just meaning there God is
[58:52] going to leave us in in uh or leave us
[58:56] or bless us in and exceed in faith
[58:59] now but I want I want us to just look at
[59:02] something tonight
[59:04] uh
[59:19] Matthew chapter 10.
[59:35] Matthew chapter 10 let's read from verse
[59:37] 14.
[59:41] Matthew chapter 10 let's read from verse
[59:44] 40. he that receive you receiveth me and
[59:49] he that receiveth me receiveth him that
[59:52] sent me
[59:54] he that receiveth a prophet in the name
[59:58] of a prophet
[1:00:00] shall receive a prophet reward
[1:00:04] and he that receiveth a righteous man in
[1:00:08] the name of a righteous man shall
[1:00:10] receive a righteous man reward
[1:00:14] and whosoever shall give a drink unto
[1:00:18] one of these little ones
[1:00:20] a cup of cold water
[1:00:23] only in the name of a disciple verily I
[1:00:26] say unto you he shall in no wise lose
[1:00:30] his reward
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:34] now uh I know we you read this and uh
[1:00:42] people
[1:00:43] that are familiar with the message you
[1:00:45] go direct your mind goes directly to uh
[1:00:48] the code there where brother Brandon was
[1:00:50] asked what is a prophet's reward now I
[1:00:53] want to I want us to just look at that a
[1:00:56] little bit and uh and also to be able to
[1:01:01] to uh to appreciate something here in a
[1:01:04] way that the that the scripture uh plays
[1:01:08] some things now so you see Jesus here
[1:01:11] he's he's he's he's talking in the sense
[1:01:14] of reward yet and you know and and we
[1:01:17] know that God reward his people
[1:01:20] and he's talking about uh you know uh uh
[1:01:23] being received and talking to the
[1:01:26] disciples you know uh because he's
[1:01:28] sending them out uh into missions and
[1:01:31] says you know him that receive you
[1:01:33] receive mean him that receive a prophet
[1:01:36] in the name of a prophet shall receive
[1:01:38] your prophet's reward now uh uh
[1:01:44] you know
[1:01:45] someone asked me this question back
[1:01:47] before Wednesday since his brother won
[1:01:49] you know Broadband talks about a prophet
[1:01:51] reward but what is a righteous man
[1:01:54] reward
[1:01:55] because it looks like he only answered
[1:01:57] one part of the the the the scripture
[1:01:59] because he was asked what is a prophet's
[1:02:02] reward but what is a righteous man
[1:02:04] reward now you see it is where in the
[1:02:07] scripture
[1:02:08] you will find it looks like two separate
[1:02:12] statements but it's one in the same
[1:02:17] praise the Lord
[1:02:19] okay let's let's look at another one
[1:02:22] that is very common to us Isaiah chapter
[1:02:24] 53 we will come back to this
[1:02:29] Isaiah chapter 53.
[1:02:40] I hope I can be able to run over this
[1:02:42] quickly and then just give a little time
[1:02:45] here for us to pray before we close the
[1:02:46] service
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:50] Isaiah chapter 53 here the Bible says
[1:02:53] verse 1 who have believed our report
[1:02:56] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:03:00] reveal
[1:03:01] it looks like two different questions
[1:03:04] but it is it is it is in the place where
[1:03:09] one question is answering another
[1:03:11] question
[1:03:15] praise the Lord
[1:03:17] amen because brother Branham would take
[1:03:19] that in a message to whom the arm of the
[1:03:21] Lord revealed he says this he said who
[1:03:24] have believed our report
[1:03:26] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:03:29] he said here is it tonight they believe
[1:03:32] they report
[1:03:34] the arm of the Lord is revealed
[1:03:39] amen
[1:03:42] so them that believe the report they are
[1:03:45] the one that sees the arm of the Lord
[1:03:48] being revealed to them
[1:03:51] so it looks like two separate questions
[1:03:54] but it is uh uh uh I mean it is the way
[1:03:59] that God God speaks to us you know uh uh
[1:04:04] he's asking the question and he's
[1:04:06] answering the question also
[1:04:09] so the prophet of God says yet uh uh
[1:04:13] here is it tonight they believed the
[1:04:15] report the arm of the Lord is revealed
[1:04:18] We Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:04:22] now rebuke every Spirit of the devil
[1:04:26] that will bound these people in the name
[1:04:29] of Jesus Christ the son of the Living
[1:04:31] God Amen so when we believe God's report
[1:04:35] when we believe what the word of God
[1:04:37] says then the arm of the Lord what is
[1:04:39] the arm of the Lord the power of God
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:44] then we seize the arm of the Lord on the
[1:04:47] scene you know are like uh uh uh uh
[1:04:50] Brother Band help us to understand what
[1:04:53] the right the right hand of the father
[1:04:54] means Authority
[1:04:57] so when we believe his report we believe
[1:05:01] the word that is Promised for our day
[1:05:06] then we will see the arm of the Lord
[1:05:09] so just like we talk about uh being in
[1:05:12] the Revival of the hour lining up lining
[1:05:15] ourselves up with the word that's the
[1:05:18] way we we can be able to see the arm of
[1:05:20] God in our life
[1:05:22] praise the Lord
[1:05:24] so you see for the church word we we the
[1:05:28] the the the people goes in in you know
[1:05:31] in an in in this faction word I mean uh
[1:05:35] the the the the the they gave themselves
[1:05:37] to to uh uh uh uh praying and you know
[1:05:41] fasting and you do all of those things
[1:05:43] but the ability to line up with the word
[1:05:46] is not there
[1:05:47] it's not that fasting and praying is
[1:05:49] wrong we must do that
[1:05:52] you see but it is almost like if you if
[1:05:56] you do that uh uh uh in a sense of
[1:06:00] wanting God to fulfill his word to
[1:06:03] demonstrate his power and and our life
[1:06:06] will not line up with the word
[1:06:08] then is completely contrary
[1:06:14] praise the Lord
[1:06:15] so to them that belief
[1:06:18] his report
[1:06:20] they are the one that will see the arm
[1:06:22] of the Lord amen
[1:06:24] now so if you bring their back to the
[1:06:28] same thing as
[1:06:29] a prophet's reward and a righteous man
[1:06:32] reward is won anything
[1:06:35] why because a prophet is a righteous man
[1:06:40] praise the Lord a prophet is a righteous
[1:06:43] man see brother Branham said yeah
[1:06:48] in the message uh I am the resurrection
[1:06:52] and the life he said this
[1:06:55] he says this is the house of judgment
[1:07:00] the house of God where God comes down
[1:07:03] and passes his judgment
[1:07:07] your pastor is supposed to be a
[1:07:11] righteous man
[1:07:13] the congregation is supposed to be with
[1:07:17] him 100 percent
[1:07:20] praise the Lord another principle
[1:07:24] why it's supposed to be that way because
[1:07:27] it helps to the people to build
[1:07:30] confidence in the man
[1:07:32] when his life comes on the question
[1:07:36] praise the Lord he might call fire down
[1:07:39] from heaven but it's hard for the people
[1:07:41] to have confidence in him
[1:07:45] praise the Lord so if your pastor have
[1:07:48] to be a righteous man your Prophet also
[1:07:50] must be a righteous man
[1:07:55] and and the congregation is supposed to
[1:07:58] be with him 100
[1:08:00] you are supposed to be just a hundred
[1:08:03] percent together
[1:08:06] and in there
[1:08:08] if you are not then Satan God away to
[1:08:12] get in
[1:08:14] amen you got a loophole somewhere going
[1:08:17] to have everything cleared out you need
[1:08:20] to have everything clear out
[1:08:23] if there's a question on your mind ask
[1:08:25] it
[1:08:28] praise the Lord now so this is the
[1:08:30] pastor this is the the the the header of
[1:08:33] the local church but place this also in
[1:08:37] the place of a prophet
[1:08:41] as we believe brother bran a message we
[1:08:43] come honor that message and we believe
[1:08:45] him proving about the scripture that he
[1:08:48] is the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:08:51] praise the Lord
[1:08:54] while we have confidence in that
[1:08:57] Ministry it is not only because we
[1:08:59] ignored about separency or also but
[1:09:01] because we realize that God helping to
[1:09:04] live a righteous life
[1:09:11] praise the Lord
[1:09:16] that is the thing there
[1:09:18] that's the thing that create confidence
[1:09:23] a righteous life
[1:09:28] so uh
[1:09:32] the minister is supposed to have a
[1:09:34] righteous life he must be a righteous
[1:09:36] man
[1:09:37] my mind is flinging here on something
[1:09:41] but that's fine
[1:09:43] okay let's go back to this now there are
[1:09:46] questions there over in question and
[1:09:47] answer kind of for looking at the time
[1:09:49] here
[1:09:51] brother Branham yet he takes that he
[1:09:53] says someone asks him and says brother
[1:09:55] Brandon if you have a time please
[1:09:57] explain Matthew
[1:10:00] 10 41 I would like to know
[1:10:04] what is a profit's reward
[1:10:08] well now Jesus said whosoever receive a
[1:10:11] prophet in the name of a prophet
[1:10:13] receives a prophet reward
[1:10:17] a perfect reward is to be a friend with
[1:10:20] the prophet
[1:10:24] whosoever received a righteous man in
[1:10:27] the name of a righteous man receive a
[1:10:30] righteous man reward is that right and
[1:10:33] if they will and if they want to know
[1:10:36] what a prophet reward is is to be a
[1:10:40] friend of a prophet see that's that's a
[1:10:43] reward
[1:10:44] he's your friend
[1:10:47] like the shimini woman it might come in
[1:10:51] handy sometimes
[1:10:53] praise the Lord now so brother Branham
[1:10:55] dropped a clue here for us when he
[1:10:58] brings in the life of the shimini woman
[1:11:02] now there are a few things there
[1:11:05] because uh
[1:11:08] uh
[1:11:10] uh we want to we want to try and keep
[1:11:11] the word in context so brother Branham
[1:11:13] is identifying that uh a prophet's
[1:11:17] reward is to be the friend of a prophet
[1:11:21] now you have to remember that in Isaiah
[1:11:24] I believe that chapter 48 almighty God
[1:11:27] called Abraham his friend
[1:11:31] okay so it is more like uh we read the
[1:11:36] scripture there in uh uh Genesis uh 16
[1:11:40] God is saying I am your great and your
[1:11:43] exceeding reward okay is God bringing
[1:11:48] you into uh into a place of friendship a
[1:11:53] place of Covenant you know a place of
[1:11:55] trust
[1:11:56] let me see their way a place of trust
[1:11:59] now so uh uh
[1:12:04] you realize that uh
[1:12:06] it must also be at a place where uh
[1:12:11] uh you know the the office of the of the
[1:12:13] of the of the of the Prophet is there
[1:12:16] now a prophet of of the age is a Seer
[1:12:21] you know uh uh uh he's he's he's not
[1:12:25] only a prophet to one church he becomes
[1:12:27] unless it's just a gift in the local
[1:12:29] body but uh you know a prophet Ministry
[1:12:32] is a prophet to the to the entire age
[1:12:36] now but there has also some patterns
[1:12:39] where you you see that uh uh uh uh that
[1:12:44] place just like we look at the cold
[1:12:46] weather brand was talking about the
[1:12:48] pastor must be a righteous man we took
[1:12:51] that in time also to be able to relate
[1:12:54] you know the office of the man and also
[1:12:57] his life the life that he lived before
[1:12:59] the people now so it is either place
[1:13:03] where uh uh if you if you look at you
[1:13:08] know the the life of the man it is worth
[1:13:11] God bless a man with such a gift
[1:13:19] to also because you see what happened is
[1:13:21] that many people when it gets to the
[1:13:24] place of experiencing spiritual gift
[1:13:26] they try to either think they are they
[1:13:30] are superior or they you cannot come
[1:13:33] close to them
[1:13:36] praise the Lord
[1:13:38] amen and and that is that is a dangerous
[1:13:42] place
[1:13:43] even our lord Jesus he was called the
[1:13:46] friend of sinners
[1:13:49] the ability to be able to step from
[1:13:53] their Divine Office and still be a human
[1:13:59] praise the Lord
[1:14:00] and say be a human and stay be able to
[1:14:03] communicate with the people like brother
[1:14:04] Brandon he's dropping this clue he says
[1:14:07] just like the shimina woman it might
[1:14:09] come in handy
[1:14:12] why she became a friend to the prophet
[1:14:17] that she could invite him to her house
[1:14:19] and uh you know and and uh uh uh I mean
[1:14:23] they could talk brother Brandon will go
[1:14:25] fishing with uh uh uh some brothers go
[1:14:28] hunting with some brothers and uh you
[1:14:31] know and uh and I mean we all we call
[1:14:33] him brother Brandon the people down his
[1:14:35] street call him Billy they never even
[1:14:37] call him a prophet
[1:14:43] because I mean their brother uh air was
[1:14:46] reading the quotes a year then brother
[1:14:47] bam talking I was walking and I saw the
[1:14:50] girl then it says you can come to our
[1:14:52] house sometimes
[1:14:53] I'll be walking I'm greeting her and she
[1:14:55] can't even answer me
[1:14:58] praise the Lord
[1:15:01] no he did not say well don't you know
[1:15:03] I'm the prophet
[1:15:05] I fulfill my like I fall
[1:15:10] praise the Lord
[1:15:12] amen so in in one sense
[1:15:15] is a blessing
[1:15:20] it's a blessing
[1:15:23] in a way that the scripture have it
[1:15:26] that the scripture where even open us to
[1:15:30] the life
[1:15:32] of some of God's prophet
[1:15:36] praise the Lord because it's only our
[1:15:38] phrase that we tell our secret to
[1:15:42] our life is not hate
[1:15:46] so that is the area of friendship
[1:15:54] where there it it is not it is not only
[1:15:57] that we know
[1:15:59] the the The Man Behind the pulpit
[1:16:04] we also know his life
[1:16:10] praise the Lord
[1:16:13] we also know his life and that is a
[1:16:16] reward
[1:16:19] that is a reward
[1:16:25] comes and and he's the one that tells us
[1:16:27] there was nobody that wrote the story it
[1:16:29] was not system either that wrote the
[1:16:31] story of Billy Paul that wrote the story
[1:16:33] it was brother Brandon right after that
[1:16:36] exchange on the telephone
[1:16:40] when brother Branham came to to to
[1:16:42] preach the message total Deliverance he
[1:16:45] was the one that told us I was on the
[1:16:48] phone I was tired with these people I
[1:16:50] told sister media I tell them I'm not
[1:16:52] here I'm jumping out of the house
[1:16:54] he was the one I told nobody wrote it
[1:16:58] it was not after he died that we came to
[1:17:00] find out
[1:17:04] praise the Lord
[1:17:06] amen and he's even letting us know
[1:17:10] he's even letting us know he says the
[1:17:13] next time the phone rang Joseph said
[1:17:15] daddy should I tell them that you are
[1:17:16] not here
[1:17:17] he said you see that's how those things
[1:17:20] rub off he's the one telling all these
[1:17:22] things
[1:17:26] what is that it's every word
[1:17:31] God is rewarding us that's the reason
[1:17:34] why we cannot deify brother Branham
[1:17:41] because God has made us to see the man
[1:17:45] that he was and and Care us of his birth
[1:17:47] and and tell us of uh his upbringing in
[1:17:51] him all of his struggle
[1:17:54] and then we have also seen the place
[1:17:57] where God takes that very same vessel
[1:18:01] and he brings the word
[1:18:03] he tells the needs of the people
[1:18:07] it's a reward to you
[1:18:15] praise the Lord
[1:18:21] now so you can you can see that picture
[1:18:24] just like he dropped the clue there and
[1:18:27] you think about uh uh uh Moses
[1:18:32] think about Moses why you think Quran
[1:18:36] and Daytona Baron why you think that
[1:18:39] they even got
[1:18:42] they're taught to challenge Moses
[1:18:46] if Moses was only going up in the
[1:18:49] mountain
[1:18:51] and coming down and bringing in the the
[1:18:53] word
[1:18:55] they will be terrified all the time
[1:19:01] praise the Lord
[1:19:04] oh yeah they knew about Moses life he
[1:19:06] ran away from Egypt they know that one
[1:19:10] they knew that he grew up in Pharaoh's
[1:19:12] house they knew that one
[1:19:15] praise the Lord
[1:19:16] oh they know also that he married an
[1:19:19] Egyptian why they knew that one
[1:19:27] praise the Lord
[1:19:29] that is a place of a public servant your
[1:19:33] life is in the hands of the public
[1:19:36] is before the people
[1:19:38] but you see to the people
[1:19:42] it's a reward it's a gift
[1:19:44] for you to know all of this about this
[1:19:47] man and still respect him
[1:19:53] praise the Lord
[1:19:56] that is the struggle
[1:19:58] that was a problem that Quran ended on
[1:20:01] half
[1:20:06] because you see that is the place where
[1:20:08] the church word we we we we we we we
[1:20:12] live for our leaders and we worship them
[1:20:15] is because we only see them in the eye
[1:20:18] of the ministry
[1:20:22] and forget that they are humans
[1:20:26] to be able to carry the two
[1:20:29] as a balance is a reward
[1:20:36] praise the Lord
[1:20:38] so see the man as a man
[1:20:41] and to respect the gift of God in the
[1:20:44] office of God
[1:20:46] it's a reward
[1:20:48] praise the Lord
[1:20:51] and many times many times
[1:20:55] we get into struggle when those things
[1:20:58] happen
[1:21:01] so the prophet of God Will Tell Us in
[1:21:03] the message respect
[1:21:05] you know if you don't respect him and
[1:21:07] just be respect the office
[1:21:15] because it's a reward
[1:21:19] okay for example like a son
[1:21:21] or like a child
[1:21:26] that is in the house there with their
[1:21:27] parents and the Dare they see you know
[1:21:30] they are dead and they see all the
[1:21:32] struggle and everything can uh you know
[1:21:35] that place to be able to keep the
[1:21:38] position that this is my father and also
[1:21:41] to see his mistakes and and to just to
[1:21:43] keep it together
[1:21:52] where Brian told us the hardest thing
[1:21:54] that God
[1:21:56] have ever had to deal with is to bring
[1:21:59] warm water
[1:22:00] to believe in another
[1:22:04] praise the Lord
[1:22:05] we appreciate the person
[1:22:08] it can be your friend
[1:22:11] it can be a brother or a sister you know
[1:22:14] we from far we admire them from far we
[1:22:17] appreciate them and so now it starts to
[1:22:19] come close and start to see some
[1:22:21] weaknesses of one another we have the
[1:22:24] human tendency of despise in the person
[1:22:31] but if you have the grace
[1:22:35] to be able to carry the tool
[1:22:39] praise the Lord
[1:22:44] to be able to carry the two you know
[1:22:46] that it's something that is common
[1:22:48] in uh uh uh the human nature
[1:22:52] we are good friends
[1:22:55] and let's remain good friends forever
[1:22:56] because the day their friendship break
[1:22:59] all people will know everything about
[1:23:01] the things that we know about
[1:23:06] then we start to tell we start to run
[1:23:08] our mouth
[1:23:09] that one I know all his secrets
[1:23:15] someone says that the reason why I can't
[1:23:17] get rid of my friends because they know
[1:23:19] all of my secrets
[1:23:22] I want to get rid of them but I can't
[1:23:24] get rid of them because they know all of
[1:23:26] my secrets
[1:23:31] I believe that's the reason why uh uh
[1:23:33] James encouraged us there that if you uh
[1:23:37] you know uh uh uh have a brother back or
[1:23:41] help a sister back you cover the
[1:23:43] multitudes of their weakness
[1:23:46] you now become a steward
[1:23:51] when a person share their weaknesses
[1:23:54] with you
[1:23:55] you become you manage that
[1:23:58] that weakness does not change your
[1:24:01] attitude
[1:24:04] it's a reward
[1:24:10] praise the Lord
[1:24:12] it's a reward
[1:24:17] take it for take it in a scriptural
[1:24:19] context let me close here
[1:24:21] foreign
[1:24:27] why he came down
[1:24:29] because lot lot was the one that uh that
[1:24:33] that that did the choosing to go
[1:24:37] he was the one that brought the proposal
[1:24:39] there there is a fighting between our
[1:24:41] harrismen let's let's separate
[1:24:45] he brought all of this
[1:24:48] and then he went down there to Sodom and
[1:24:50] now he's in trouble it's it was it's
[1:24:53] easier
[1:24:55] for Abraham to say he looked for it let
[1:24:57] he get it
[1:24:59] but that's not Abraham
[1:25:02] praise the Lord he heard Lord was in
[1:25:05] trouble he went for lot what happened
[1:25:07] Lord came out where did he went he went
[1:25:09] right back into Sodom
[1:25:15] you see so you are not helping the
[1:25:17] person
[1:25:18] uh based on their attitude
[1:25:21] you are helping them
[1:25:23] based on your dealing with God
[1:25:30] that's why God came down and reward
[1:25:34] Abraham with himself
[1:25:40] that's a prophet's reward that's a
[1:25:42] righteous man reward
[1:25:45] it's not that all the other man is a
[1:25:47] Raja member you know that that God
[1:25:49] actually you know I know I get question
[1:25:51] mark on him
[1:25:54] so what are you based in the
[1:25:55] righteousness on
[1:26:00] foreign
[1:26:20] it's a reward
[1:26:25] that's a prophet's reward that's a a a
[1:26:28] righteous man reward because a prophet
[1:26:30] is a righteous man
[1:26:32] you can separate the two
[1:26:36] he must be a righteous man or as he just
[1:26:38] have a gift he's not a prophet
[1:26:42] if your life do not line up with faith
[1:26:44] he's not a prophet he just have a gift
[1:26:54] are we together
[1:26:59] it's a reward it's a blessing
[1:27:03] when we can be able
[1:27:06] to see
[1:27:08] the weakness of someone
[1:27:12] and cover it
[1:27:15] cover it with prayers
[1:27:18] cover it with encouragement
[1:27:23] not cover it by allowing them to
[1:27:26] continue
[1:27:29] no that's not a covering I'm talking
[1:27:31] about
[1:27:33] Now cover it by allowing them to
[1:27:35] continue then you are you you are
[1:27:37] participating in it
[1:27:40] but cover it by having an Earnest talk
[1:27:43] let's sit down let's let's sit down this
[1:27:46] thing is not right
[1:27:48] this thing is not right it's going to
[1:27:50] destroy you
[1:27:57] praise the Lord
[1:27:59] and yet we can go away from there with
[1:28:02] that person having so much confidence in
[1:28:04] their heart
