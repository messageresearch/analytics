[40:02] let's let's take our Bibles and go
[40:04] straight to the Book of Matthew chapter
[40:06] uh
[40:07] 6 Matthew chapter 6 on uh uh Sunday we
[40:11] read from Luke but we reading the same
[40:13] uh the same account uh uh uh we reading
[40:18] the same account uh that we read I'm
[40:21] going to continue in a little bit
[40:22] Solomon in all of his glory that's why
[40:25] we spoke on uh on
[40:27] Sunday uh we read Luke account of what
[40:31] Jesus said is uh it's as much as the
[40:34] same as what Matthew was saying here in
[40:37] uh chapter
[40:39] 6 so let's uh let's just go to uh
[40:43] Matthew chapter 6 praise the Lord
[40:50] amen
[40:55] amen
[41:03] let's read Matthew chapter 6 verse 28
[41:06] Matthew chap 6 verse 28 if uh I'm right
[41:09] yet Matthew 628 praise the
[41:13] Lord verse
[41:15] 28 and why take ye thought of remen
[41:20] consider the ladies of the field how
[41:23] they
[41:24] grow they told all that needle do they
[41:29] Spain and yet I said unto you that even
[41:33] Solomon in all his glory was not a ra
[41:37] like one of
[41:39] these praise the Lord let us pray
[41:43] tonight heavenly father almighty God we
[41:47] we just want to thank you precious Lord
[41:49] we we glorify your name tonight and we
[41:52] pray to God that you would just bless us
[41:54] now father as we go right into your word
[41:57] in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord
[41:59] bless you you may have your seat and uh
[42:02] talking about uh raymen yes Solomon in
[42:05] all of his glory is uh uh is not a read
[42:09] like one of these what what considered
[42:11] raymen and uh as as we're praying for
[42:14] brother brother je
[42:15] BBE one of the one of the sisters after
[42:19] we spoke on the the message uh uh uh the
[42:23] T the hand of Jehovah I will just
[42:26] sharing with you what uh I experienced
[42:28] Lord visiting him and uh uh a sister had
[42:32] a dream and and uh and told me about it
[42:35] you know in dream and uh uh brother J
[42:39] BBE was thanking the church for praying
[42:42] for him and he says he was going home to
[42:45] change his clothes and uh and to come
[42:48] back to
[42:50] service and so when she told me that I
[42:53] said well uh uh it's to me it sounds
[42:58] like a good dream it sounds like a
[42:59] spiritual dream but there are there are
[43:02] too many here in my mind uh not an
[43:05] interpretation but just too many here in
[43:07] my mind of the change of clothes is
[43:10] either the person is changing from
[43:11] Health from sickness to
[43:14] health or they are changing from morar
[43:17] to
[43:19] immortality I said that's the two things
[43:22] that that is on my mind as I listening
[43:23] to what you are telling me so we just
[43:26] place it before the Lord whichever
[43:28] changing we still benefit
[43:31] amen amen so uh uh I just read this uh
[43:35] uh Solomon in all of his glory is not a
[43:38] real like one of them and so it came it
[43:40] come flashing back to my mind so uh uh
[43:44] we we were talking about this subject
[43:46] introducing on on uh on Sunday uh as we
[43:50] as we keep talking about the different
[43:52] things that the Lord is laying on our
[43:54] heart and uh I want to continue to go
[43:56] right into there U uh first king chapter
[44:00] 10 first king chapter 10 we want to read
[44:03] a little bit here so uh uh as we as we
[44:07] talk about this and uh uh we read in
[44:11] first king chapter 4 we we uh the
[44:14] scripture gave us a little bit of a
[44:16] picture of uh uh the the kind of for
[44:20] wealth that was around Solomon and we
[44:22] said that it was a type of the
[44:25] millennium
[44:26] it was a type of the Millennium uh Paul
[44:29] says eyes have not seen neither ears
[44:32] heard uh neither have it come to the
[44:35] heart of man what God have inore for
[44:37] them that love him praise the Lord but
[44:40] yet God in his word he has given us an
[44:44] idea let me say it that way he gave us a
[44:46] shadow he gave us an idea for us to just
[44:50] to imagine you know for us to be able to
[44:53] have a mental picture of what it would
[44:55] be be like so Solomon Reign was was one
[44:59] of those uh uh ideas uh uh as we would
[45:02] call it types but it was one of those
[45:05] ideas that God a picture that God was
[45:08] was trying to give us of how how the
[45:11] Millennium was going to be when the son
[45:13] of David sits upon his throne there's
[45:15] going to be peace everywhere there's
[45:18] going to be enough praise the Lord
[45:20] there's going to be enough because all
[45:23] that he want us to do is to just worship
[45:26] the lamb amen there will be enough so
[45:28] there there will just be no time for
[45:30] working and uh you know
[45:33] uh you can pack all your skills amen you
[45:37] can pack all your you know uh uh you
[45:40] know your degrees and different thing
[45:42] because you will not need it there there
[45:44] will just be enough praise the Lord so
[45:47] as we look through the scripture we see
[45:50] uh we see different we see different
[45:53] things and like I said Jesus you have to
[45:56] remember now Jesus is the one that is
[45:59] saying to his disciple amen knowing very
[46:04] well that Solomon was a type of him amen
[46:08] knowing very word you know thou son of
[46:10] David you have to remember the Jews had
[46:13] a hold on Jesus as that son of David
[46:16] praise the Lord but that that was for
[46:18] the Millennium so Jesus is the one year
[46:21] God in flesh the very same God that came
[46:25] down and and and spoke to the scripture
[46:27] says two times the Lord revealed himself
[46:30] to Solomon the first time he told
[46:32] Solomon I will I will bless thee because
[46:35] you have not asked me for the life of
[46:37] your enemy you have not asked me but you
[46:39] asked me for a Discerning Spirit I'm
[46:41] going to bless you with wisdom like no
[46:43] man have ever had praise the Lord like
[46:46] no man have ever had so Jesus here is
[46:51] now taking that and and and uh uh noring
[46:55] of how how how much Glory that was that
[46:58] was upon Solomon not only Solomon even
[47:02] the temple that he built you know like I
[47:04] said there there there have never been
[47:06] beside beside the melenia the only
[47:09] Temple that would beat Solomon Temple
[47:11] will be the millennial Temple amen
[47:14] because the millennial Temple will be
[47:16] built by the truth son of David Jesus
[47:19] Christ amen so is going to beat Solomon
[47:22] Temple praise the Lord now so Jesus was
[47:25] the one year that is taking this and
[47:28] he's saying that uh uh uh uh Solomon in
[47:32] all of his glory in all of his glory now
[47:36] the major thing that is that that grabed
[47:39] my attention to this it was when we were
[47:41] talking about the Tabernacle we're
[47:43] talking about the uh uh the Temple of
[47:46] Solomon and uh and and the beauty beside
[47:49] all the the gold like we said the
[47:52] outside part of the Tabernacle was M
[47:55] with with bries the inside PA were
[47:58] factioned with gold and all the tables
[48:01] and cheers and Thrones and everything
[48:03] was sitting in saver and uh uh uh uh and
[48:07] but the beauty of that Temple was the
[48:12] glory of
[48:13] God praise the Lord the beauty of that
[48:17] Temple was to see the glory that
[48:20] departed you have to remember in the
[48:22] Bible you know what ining the time of
[48:24] Eli the the the glory of God departed in
[48:28] so much that that the Philistines have
[48:30] to take the Ark of the
[48:33] Covenant
[48:34] away Eli fell right off his seat and
[48:37] died his sons were killed in battle the
[48:41] glory That Glory that departed came
[48:45] back amen and it came back in a visible
[48:51] form and the people could see the glory
[48:54] that that was was the the the greatest
[48:57] thing the greatest thing of of Solomon
[48:59] Temple and that's what that's what I
[49:01] want to go to that's what I'm asking the
[49:03] Holy Ghost to to carry me and uh uh uh
[49:06] for that because uh the the thing here
[49:09] is that uh you know uh uh when
[49:14] Jesus when he taught us how to
[49:17] pray the Lord's Prayer and
[49:21] wave the
[49:23] kingdom the power and
[49:27] what the
[49:30] glory the kingdom the power and the
[49:34] glory that's where we are going with
[49:37] with this with this subject that we are
[49:38] dealing with because that's that's what
[49:41] it's all
[49:42] about that's what it's all about you
[49:45] miss that you miss the whole
[49:50] picture the reason why he brings us
[49:53] together is because of his
[49:56] Kingdom his
[49:57] power and His
[50:00] glory that's what we are here for
[50:03] tonight praise the
[50:06] Lord that's what heaven me that's why
[50:08] Christ went through Calvary that's why
[50:10] God sent a
[50:15] prophet are we
[50:19] together so you see Jesus brought that
[50:23] he brought it over to the disciples
[50:26] because uh uh he wanted to get their
[50:29] attention from uh from from from the e
[50:33] Glory he wanted to get their attention
[50:35] from all of the things that our eyes our
[50:39] mind our flesh and everything is
[50:41] attracted to and he want them also to be
[50:45] able to see that beyond the things that
[50:49] we we are seeing the things that we
[50:51] don't see there is a
[50:54] glory
[50:56] there is a
[50:58] glory are we together
[51:03] amen there is a
[51:06] glory praise the
[51:09] Lord Beyond how many of us are in church
[51:12] tonight and uh H uh the songs that is
[51:15] sang The Young World whatever the
[51:17] preacher will preach tonight you I mean
[51:19] uh we can we can we can be caught in the
[51:22] channel to be able to understand what he
[51:23] says and everything but beyond all of
[51:25] that there is a
[51:28] glory there is a glory and and that is
[51:31] what God want us to break
[51:37] into when the church ever gets to the
[51:40] place of experiencing the kingdom the
[51:42] power and the glory every service is a
[51:45] wonderful service even if we don't
[51:47] preach if we don't preach a
[51:49] message the people can stay steps into
[51:52] the
[51:54] glory
[51:57] praise the Lord
[52:01] amen there is a
[52:03] glory and for us to also realize that
[52:06] each and every one of us we carry a
[52:09] portion of that Glory that's that's part
[52:12] of everything that we are going through
[52:14] that's part of all of our trials that's
[52:16] part of of uh of uh uh our our sickness
[52:20] that's part of our stumbling and
[52:22] everything there is a glory that is HD
[52:25] behind your Fallen
[52:30] flesh and if you can ever see
[52:34] that if it can ever be made known to you
[52:38] nothing in this life will matter to
[52:42] you nothing in this
[52:46] life will matter to
[52:53] you Isaiah said the Lord says I will
[52:56] share my glory with no
[53:00] man his glory belong to him and him
[53:04] alone God is very jealous of his
[53:07] glory he's very jealous of his glory so
[53:11] that's where we are traveling with this
[53:13] subject if the Holy Ghost can just help
[53:15] us we will get there amen if he don't
[53:17] help us we'll come back again and we'll
[53:19] try
[53:21] amen oh praise the Lord so we speak we
[53:24] we we spoke about uh uh Solomon glory
[53:27] and then Jesus over in Matthew 12 vers
[53:31] uh uh verse
[53:32] 42 he used another statement again when
[53:35] he said greater than Solomon is
[53:40] here praise the
[53:43] Lord speaking to to to to these Hebrews
[53:47] these Jewish people you know that are so
[53:49] caught up into uh uh uh you know their
[53:53] their their care for the temple and they
[53:55] always talk about the greatest rign the
[53:57] son of David you know and and they were
[53:59] hoping that that would
[54:01] come and he's telling them greater than
[54:04] Solomon is
[54:07] here praise the
[54:10] Lord
[54:15] amen so greater than Solomon we look at
[54:18] a little bit of there we we we realize
[54:20] that there was a birth that is greater
[54:23] than
[54:24] Solomon
[54:28] Jesus birth was a virgin
[54:30] birth amen amen Solomon birth was a
[54:34] woman that David Fell in with adultery
[54:36] and let her married before he was
[54:39] born praise the Lord and then God comes
[54:43] back again and give you the new birth
[54:46] it's greater than
[54:49] Solomon praise the Lord the new birth
[54:52] that you have is greater than Solomon if
[54:54] you you are born
[54:56] again you see that's the reason why the
[54:58] new birth is not an
[55:00] idea
[55:02] right the new birth is not a church
[55:08] membership the new birth is an
[55:11] experience are we together amen amen and
[55:15] then we says that uh uh uh uh uh uh
[55:18] greater in Solomon his Temple was
[55:20] greater than Solomon's Temple we spoke a
[55:23] a little bit about Solomon Temple and
[55:26] and the Bible says that uh uh uh when
[55:29] you when you read that the the the the
[55:31] scripture says the the the the the the
[55:35] throne know the temple yeah just like I
[55:38] said everything in the temple was made
[55:40] out of gold it was not painted gold it
[55:43] was made out of
[55:45] gold praise the Lord amen that's the
[55:49] reason why you you you see when when
[55:51] when uh when Nebuchadnezzar when they
[55:54] looted that
[55:55] Temple praise the Lord Babylon become
[55:59] rich just from looting Solomon's
[56:03] Temple
[56:05] right praise the Lord just imagine all
[56:08] of these foreigners enter right there
[56:10] you never been in war you maybe you but
[56:12] we saw a little bit of looting that was
[56:14] done around the city here during all of
[56:16] our time of Crisis you mean those gu
[56:18] bomb right into this into the temple
[56:20] they were they were surprised
[56:23] God I think they were even breaking the
[56:25] the the ground to pick up God never seen
[56:28] God like that
[56:31] before praise the
[56:33] Lord but Jesus said greater than Solomon
[56:36] if he's greater than Solomon then his
[56:38] Temple is greater than Solomon
[56:40] Temple praise the Lord and you are the
[56:43] temple of
[56:47] God praise the Lord yes
[56:53] sir and and the Bible says the Throne of
[56:56] Solomon was made of gold and and two
[56:59] golden Lions I mean my goodness me you
[57:02] just think about that think about that
[57:05] all the nations around Syria ter and
[57:09] Egypt they were just sending
[57:14] God everything that Solomon needed was
[57:22] supplying but if Jesus is good greater
[57:25] than Solomon like I said then his throne
[57:27] is also greater than Solomon's
[57:32] Throne praise the Lord
[57:34] amen and his
[57:36] throne is in our
[57:41] hearts his throne is in our
[57:46] hearts that God the creator of Heaven
[57:49] and
[57:50] Earth that said the heaven is his throne
[57:52] the Earth Is His full stone
[57:55] he can doell in Temple made with
[57:58] hands but a
[58:00] body he will prepare for
[58:02] himself that's why he brings us through
[58:05] the stages of
[58:08] Grace Church this is not an idea is an
[58:14] experience God is bringing a people
[58:17] through the stages of Grace to dwell in
[58:23] them
[58:25] to Res them on their
[58:29] hearts
[58:30] amen are we
[58:33] together now so we were looking at all
[58:35] of this so as we look into uh uh 1 King
[58:38] chapter 10 tonight let's read a little
[58:40] bit here and uh the Bible here will
[58:42] start about the the the Queen of Sheba
[58:45] now you have to realize when Jesus was
[58:47] talking about a greater than Solomon it
[58:50] was this
[58:53] woman how how she left Ethiopia and
[58:57] travel because she heard about the
[59:00] wisdom of
[59:02] Solomon praise the Lord amen and brother
[59:06] Brown will describe that or dramatized
[59:08] that how she went through the desert and
[59:11] people try to discourage her and says oh
[59:14] god there there there are white beasts
[59:16] on the on on the road uh uh you you will
[59:18] destroy yourself you know it's it's very
[59:21] dangerous for you to travel that way but
[59:23] she did not mind what they were saying
[59:27] she heard about the wisdom of Solomon
[59:29] she wanted to get there praise the Lord
[59:32] am and she was not just only going for
[59:35] sightseing she had
[59:39] questions praise the Lord and Jesus is
[59:42] picking up the testimony of this woman
[59:45] and challenging this generation he
[59:47] challenged that generation and he's
[59:49] challenging this generation that if that
[59:52] woman can come from the sound to hear
[59:56] the wisdom of Solomon we don't have an
[1:00:00] excuse this things must never be an
[1:00:03] excuse amen weather must not be our
[1:00:08] excuse crisis must not be at our
[1:00:12] excuse praise the
[1:00:14] Lord no matter what we are going through
[1:00:16] we must be able to go and meet the
[1:00:19] greater than
[1:00:22] Solomon praise the Lord amen we must be
[1:00:25] able to get over our HS we must be able
[1:00:30] to get there so he's using that so I
[1:00:34] thought a little bit that we would just
[1:00:35] read uh uh uh first king chapter 10 year
[1:00:39] small the Bible says and when the Queen
[1:00:41] of Sheba heard of the firm of Solomon
[1:00:43] concerning the name of the Lord she came
[1:00:47] to prove
[1:00:49] him with hard
[1:00:52] questions praise the Lord
[1:00:55] she came to prove him with her
[1:00:58] questions brother bam says we we must
[1:01:01] never come to the to to to to to the
[1:01:03] house of God empty we must come with
[1:01:07] expectations we must come with
[1:01:09] expectations we must come brother Braham
[1:01:12] says we must ask God for big things we
[1:01:14] must ask him for hard
[1:01:18] things
[1:01:21] H
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:28] and she came to Jerusalem
[1:01:30] w a very great train with camels that
[1:01:35] bear spices and and very much gold she
[1:01:39] brought gold and precious stone she
[1:01:41] coming to add to the the enough gold
[1:01:43] that he already had she's bringing more
[1:01:48] gold are we
[1:01:50] together and
[1:01:52] when and uh when she was come to
[1:01:57] Solomon she communed with him of all
[1:02:01] that was in her heart and Solomon told
[1:02:04] her all her
[1:02:07] questions praise the Lord amen the gift
[1:02:11] of
[1:02:12] discernment like I said that was what
[1:02:15] listen to the scripture the Bible didn't
[1:02:17] say Solomon answer all her questions
[1:02:20] Solomon told her right all her questions
[1:02:26] but alesco said I have three questions
[1:02:28] to ask William

[1:02:49] should have the answer right
[1:02:52] right if he can tell tell you the
[1:02:55] question that you have in your
[1:02:57] heart then definitely he should have the
[1:03:03] answer and Solomon told her all her
[1:03:08] questions there was not anything hid
[1:03:11] from the
[1:03:12] King which he tore her

[1:05:22] other that I saw I said oh God longed to
[1:05:24] look for the church where everything is
[1:05:26] in
[1:05:27] order he says and whenever we get to
[1:05:30] that place whenever we will get to that
[1:05:32] place he says sin cannot stay under that
[1:05:34] atmosphere he said the spirit is going

[1:06:06] heavens that gave every Star their
[1:06:10] position it was that same just a little
[1:06:14] bit of their God in there Solomon

[1:06:50] Bible say she did not have spirit in her
[1:06:56] she was mind
[1:06:57] blown
[1:07:03] how not just people talking across the A
[1:07:07] and people doing things that they're not
[1:07:08] supposed to do
[1:07:14] no and it was not even like it was
[1:07:17] drama it was it's almost like you go the
[1:07:20] first day you see the distance and you

[1:07:45] was overwhelmed my goodness
[1:07:49] man how she wished that she could she
[1:07:53] could h h h h have such an order in her
[1:07:56] kingdom but she didn't have the god of
[1:07:59] Solomon praise the Lord she didn't have
[1:08:02] the god of Solomon she didn't have that
[1:08:05] the grace that Solomon had at a time to
[1:08:07] have such an order in his kingdom are we
[1:08:13] together she said verse six and she said
[1:08:17] to the king it was a truth report that I
[1:08:21] heard in my own land of thy arts and thy
[1:08:26] wisdom how be it I believe it not I
[1:08:30] believe not the words until I
[1:08:33] came and my eyes have seen
[1:08:36] it and behold the half was not told
[1:08:44] me meaning that what I have seen
[1:08:47] now praise the
[1:08:50] Lord was more than what they told me
[1:08:55] praise the Lord so the the people that
[1:08:56] were saying they never even came half
[1:09:00] and you can think about it because they
[1:09:01] never went into the into the king's uh h
[1:09:04] h h h chamber they never went into his
[1:09:07] Palace so they couldn't tell her all of
[1:09:10] those things she was a queen so she had
[1:09:11] a right to go there those guys were just
[1:09:13] talking about what they saw around the
[1:09:16] town
[1:09:18] right but because she was a queen she
[1:09:21] could go into the palace so she SE
[1:09:24] more she saying the half of the
[1:09:27] story right was not
[1:09:32] told that was what that was that that is
[1:09:34] where that song came from amen we sing
[1:09:38] it yeah the half is not

[1:09:45] that song I believe God is inspiration
[1:09:47] from amen whoever
[1:09:49] Ro praise the
[1:09:52] Lord she said sister the have was not
[1:09:54] told me that wisdom and prosperity
[1:09:58] exceeded the frame which I heard now see
[1:10:02] what she says now happy are the
[1:10:06] men happy are these that seven which
[1:10:11] stand continuously before thee and that
[1:10:15] year thy wisdom praise the
[1:10:19] Lord and Jesus is saying greater than
[1:10:22] Solomon is he
[1:10:25] praise the
[1:10:26] Lord amen if this if if if if the queen
[1:10:30] you see why why Jesus used that and say
[1:10:33] she will condemn this generation she
[1:10:36] stood in the presence of Solomon and she
[1:10:38] says the people that are always in
[1:10:40] service they must be happy the people
[1:10:43] that always come in your pres to have
[1:10:46] the opportunity to be in your
[1:10:49] presence how can they live with sad
[1:10:52] faces how can they leave with questions
[1:10:54] on their mind what are they doing what
[1:10:57] are they not making use of the gift that
[1:11:00] you have I never even said one word to
[1:11:02] you you told me all my questions that I
[1:11:05] had if the greater than Solomon is here
[1:11:07] the Holy Ghost it must do the same to
[1:11:09] you and we can we should never come in
[1:11:11] the house of God with sad faces
[1:11:15] sir we must go better than how we came
[1:11:18] because they're greater than Solomon is
[1:11:20] here yes
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:26] she saying Happy Blessed are these
[1:11:28] people that stand before you
[1:11:31] continuously they are seeing these
[1:11:33] things but you see what happened it
[1:11:35] becomes so common to us when we are
[1:11:38] there all the
[1:11:40] time when we are there all the time it
[1:11:43] becomes so
[1:11:47] common she's saying these people should
[1:11:49] be
[1:11:50] happy they are thinking like oh we have
[1:11:53] seen it
[1:11:55] all praise the
[1:11:57] Lord amen right maybe they were even
[1:12:01] guessing tomorrow he's he's he's wearing
[1:12:04] he's wearing Rose maybe Rose he wear
[1:12:08] Rose just bet me he will wear
[1:12:11] rose right praise the Lord
[1:12:14] amen and sometimes that's the way we
[1:12:17] want to treat the house of
[1:12:19] God it becomes like a common place to us
[1:12:23] in that way we lose our
[1:12:25] expectations yeah we just come dragging
[1:12:28] our
[1:12:28] feet barely trying it to make it a
[1:12:31] church looking for some Entertainer to
[1:12:34] entertain us for us to get happy when we
[1:12:37] supposed to come with
[1:12:40] expectation I was glad when he said let
[1:12:42] us go to the house of the Lord that what
[1:12:43] David said I was glad I was
[1:12:52] happy
[1:12:54] are we
[1:12:57] together and she was a queen that came
[1:13:00] from the
[1:13:01] South but the one that God has called to
[1:13:04] year his wisdom his predestinated
[1:13:07] children amen and you are called his
[1:13:10] bride yes
[1:13:13] sir praise the
[1:13:16] Lord you are called his bride that is
[1:13:19] the thing that destroyed relationship
[1:13:21] when when when when a bride
[1:13:24] stands
[1:13:27] to not not not not Mo expense of loose
[1:13:30] respect when the word of confidence when
[1:13:34] she starts to L confidence in the words
[1:13:37] of the
[1:13:41] bridegroom praise the Lord right
[1:13:48] amen when we start to lose confidence I
[1:13:51] mean when we look at our our our eff and
[1:13:53] natural relationship well yeah there are
[1:13:55] some things that sometimes people do and
[1:13:57] then you question it and you'll talk
[1:13:59] about it but that should that is not
[1:14:01] compared you see because sometimes when
[1:14:03] we talk these things it's so easy for us
[1:14:06] to fall in the
[1:14:10] natural and then we miss the the the
[1:14:13] spiritual aspect we are talking about
[1:14:15] our bridegroom Jesus Christ is there a
[1:14:19] reason why we must not have confidence
[1:14:21] in his
[1:14:22] word
[1:14:23] is there something that we going through
[1:14:25] in our life that we think that because
[1:14:28] we are going through this I can't
[1:14:29] believe God word
[1:14:31] anymore no
[1:14:41] sir praise the
[1:14:44] Lord happy are these
[1:14:48] men happy at these that seven we stand
[1:14:55] continuously before thee and that and I
[1:14:59] hear thy wisdom blessed be the Lord thy
[1:15:03] God which delighted in thee to set thee
[1:15:06] on the throne of Israel
[1:15:09] because the Lord love Israel
[1:15:12] forever praise the Lord she seeing such
[1:15:16] a
[1:15:19] wisdom making it so easy for her to
[1:15:21] believe in God God Of Heaven and
[1:15:24] Earth because no matter who what God she
[1:15:28] was worshiping what religion she believe
[1:15:31] she beli in she has come to believe that
[1:15:34] there is a greater
[1:15:36] power right amen there's a greater power
[1:15:40] because there cannot be order without an
[1:15:44] intelligence behind
[1:15:46] it amen there cannot be other that's the
[1:15:50] reason why all this B bang and evolution
[1:15:54] is just is just a trash there cannot be
[1:15:57] an
[1:15:58] other without an intelligence behind
[1:16:03] it every design the design of your
[1:16:06] clothes that you wear you see it you
[1:16:08] like it there is an intelligence that
[1:16:10] put it together
[1:16:14] right and that's what she was
[1:16:16] saying for the order that she have seen
[1:16:19] and and and and and the glory that she
[1:16:21] have seen she has come to believe that
[1:16:24] there is an intelligence called the god
[1:16:27] of
[1:16:32] Israel are we
[1:16:37] together all people we must not allow
[1:16:40] these things to become common to
[1:16:44] us we must not allow it to become
[1:16:48] common that's the reason why that
[1:16:50] prophet of God said that just one one
[1:16:53] one one
[1:16:56] message he says uh you know uh he said
[1:16:59] it's not a fair thing that we must be
[1:17:01] preached to all the times and there are
[1:17:02] people that have never heard the gospel
[1:17:09] once because it should take just one
[1:17:12] experience in God's presence to affect
[1:17:16] our
[1:17:17] life that we can we can never be the
[1:17:22] same
[1:17:24] and that's what the new birth
[1:17:26] brings that's what the new birth brings
[1:17:29] when that experience affect our life we
[1:17:32] can never be the same we might go
[1:17:34] through trials we might go through
[1:17:36] sicknesses even onto death but we will
[1:17:39] never be the
[1:17:44] same are we
[1:17:46] together Jesus says consider the
[1:17:52] lady and he ended there with that with
[1:17:54] that uh h h h famous statement seek ye
[1:17:57] first the kingdom of God and all of his
[1:18:01] righteousness and I told you on Sunday
[1:18:03] th word seek you know uh uh uh it it has
[1:18:07] been it has been so driving through the
[1:18:11] ages that it looks like we we we need to
[1:18:14] find the most brightest touch light and
[1:18:16] be looking around you can't seek the
[1:18:19] kingdom the Kingdom Come seeking you
[1:18:22] right the kingdom k to seek
[1:18:24] you you cannot seek the
[1:18:27] kiddom praise the Lord amen you can't
[1:18:30] seek the kingdom the kingdom was the one
[1:18:32] that sought
[1:18:34] you now that the kingdom has sought
[1:18:38] you what you are called to do is to
[1:18:44] discover discover that's why we call
[1:18:48] Revelation discover let me tell let me
[1:18:51] ask you a question we get cell phones we
[1:18:55] get 5G I don't know the next G that will
[1:18:58] come up we get all of these things that
[1:19:01] are now in the
[1:19:03] word let me ask you a question when did
[1:19:06] when did they came on
[1:19:09] Earth as long as the Earth has exist
[1:19:13] they were year that's right
[1:19:16] right they were here when Adam and Eve
[1:19:20] was here 5G was here right right
[1:19:24] whatever we are having as mod invention
[1:19:27] was already here men discovered them
[1:19:31] right they never brought it to Earth it
[1:19:34] was yeah and Men
[1:19:39] discover every truth in the Bible has
[1:19:41] always been in the Bible the sepy was
[1:19:44] here the the seals were here the church
[1:19:46] Ages were here they were already here
[1:19:49] amen and God sent his
[1:19:51] men
[1:19:54] and through Revelation they break into
[1:19:56] those things and they bring us the truth
[1:19:58] of
[1:20:06] God so that that seeking concept that
[1:20:11] seeking concept is not the thought of oh
[1:20:14] you got to get the doctrine right oh you
[1:20:17] got to get the church order right
[1:20:19] because that's the way our mind goes all
[1:20:22] the the Bible says seeking first the
[1:20:23] kingdom of God and all of his
[1:20:27] righteousness our mind goes in a form of
[1:20:30] seeking looking for something we not
[1:20:32] supposed to be looking we're supposed to
[1:20:34] be admiring the things that are around
[1:20:36] us admiring the thing that God is doing
[1:20:39] in your life appreciating
[1:20:44] it that his grace can keep me his grace
[1:20:48] can wake me up that he can bring me down
[1:20:51] to my knees to pray you s supposed to
[1:20:53] be appreciating there that's right
[1:20:59] wow where my life would have been if it
[1:21:02] was not the grace of God yes sir thank
[1:21:05] you
[1:21:07] Lord praise the
[1:21:10] Lord you cannot find the kingdom if God
[1:21:13] do not give it to you you can find it
[1:21:16] right Jesus told Nicodemus the same
[1:21:19] until you are born again you cannot see
[1:21:22] the of God you can't find it yes
[1:21:28] sir so you can run to all the message
[1:21:31] Church you want to go to seeking the
[1:21:32] kingdom you will not find it right
[1:21:35] because that kingdom is right in
[1:21:37] you and until you start looking to
[1:21:40] yourself and appreciating the thing that
[1:21:43] the grace of God is doing in your life
[1:21:45] every day
[1:21:49] amen seeking the kingdom is not
[1:21:52] understanding the Myster of the Bible
[1:21:54] there are men that can spin your hair
[1:21:56] with this Bible they can spin your hair
[1:21:59] they can take out things in this
[1:22:01] Bible but yet they don't know anything
[1:22:03] about the Kingdom right
[1:22:07] right they can carry you to the Greek
[1:22:10] and bring you back to the Latin and
[1:22:11] bring you back to the Hebrew and all of
[1:22:16] that Jesus said you being chief of the
[1:22:19] Pharisees you don't know what it means
[1:22:21] to be born again
[1:22:23] he was singing about going back into his
[1:22:25] mother
[1:22:28] womb praise the
[1:22:37] Lord seek he
[1:22:39] first the kingdom of
[1:22:42] God and I told you when you find the
[1:22:47] kingdom when you find the kingdom the
[1:22:50] next thing comes to pass
[1:22:54] power the next comes to
[1:22:59] Glory that's the reason why the church
[1:23:01] is far from its
[1:23:04] reality the church is very far from its
[1:23:07] reality we talk about the seals is open
[1:23:09] we talk about the mystery of God God
[1:23:11] sent a prophet yet and still we are
[1:23:13] still far we are living under our
[1:23:16] privilege the things that we must be
[1:23:18] enjoying like like children of God we
[1:23:21] have reduced it to all material things
[1:23:26] right we have reduced it to all material
[1:23:39] things praise the Lord
[1:23:44] amen that as that as a Son of God the
[1:23:46] devil will use those very things and
[1:23:49] then he afflect all with with with
[1:23:51] depression he afflect us with different
[1:23:54] things in our lives
[1:23:59] right it's because we are not
[1:24:01] discovering the
[1:24:03] glory we are not discovering Jesus says
[1:24:06] that they said the kingdom of God he
[1:24:07] said don't look here don't look that
[1:24:08] that kingdom is in
[1:24:19] you praise the
[1:24:21] Lord
[1:24:22] everything everything
[1:24:26] everything the driverless car
[1:24:29] the astronauts and everything Atomic B
[1:24:34] everything that they are making they are
[1:24:36] not bringing it from somewhere else they
[1:24:38] it was always
[1:24:41] here man is just discovering the
[1:24:45] Earth
[1:24:48] right they are discovering the Earth in
[1:24:52] we came from out of the earth so which
[1:24:55] mean also we can discover
[1:24:57] ourself we can discover our potential
[1:25:00] our
[1:25:01] abilities but you see the Devil Keep
[1:25:04] keep us away from ourself he makes other
[1:25:08] people our focus when you cannot when
[1:25:11] you cannot change those people lives
[1:25:13] when you when you cannot you cannot be
[1:25:15] like them he take you away from yourself
[1:25:17] and to look at your
[1:25:20] abilities right
[1:25:24] no matter what it is the man new
[1:25:27] creative power in you that you can be
[1:25:29] able to take a
[1:25:31] pen and write a
[1:25:35] p you can be able to take a pen and even
[1:25:39] write your own prayers your your the
[1:25:41] desire of your heart to be able to set
[1:25:43] it down and write it what we read in
[1:25:46] some is David
[1:25:48] prayer
[1:25:51] right oh oh Lord my God in you I trust
[1:25:54] we read that and we recite it but it was
[1:25:58] a man just like
[1:25:59] you
[1:26:04] right that was expressing his heart to
[1:26:21] God seeking first the kingdom of
[1:26:26] God
[1:26:31] Amen
[1:26:33] Solomon in all of his
[1:26:36] glory and you read down here I mean uh
[1:26:39] uh uh I I just I just stop here this
[1:26:42] another part of this uh chapter I wanted
[1:26:44] to go in it starts to talk about chapter
[1:26:48] 14 now the word of God that came to
[1:26:50] Solomon in one year
[1:26:52] 63 scores and six talents of
[1:26:57] gold that came to him just in one
[1:27:05] year and it's all of those things all of
[1:27:08] those
[1:27:13] things praise the
[1:27:21] Lord
[1:27:24] are we
[1:27:30] together so I didn't open my bottle I'm
[1:27:32] bringing
[1:27:40] it now you think about it think about it
[1:27:45] with with with the wealth that was in
[1:27:47] Solomon's uh uh
[1:27:50] Kingdom the wealth that was in solom Mon
[1:27:52] kdom and all the glory that was around
[1:27:55] this man think about it it's it's so
[1:27:59] it's so
[1:28:04] mysterious
[1:28:06] yet there were poor
[1:28:09] people that were in the
[1:28:12] Land There were
[1:28:14] people that was that was that was in
[1:28:18] need that's that's another face of this
[1:28:20] I I was going to bring to you
[1:28:22] uh uh because if you see what happened
[1:28:25] right after Solomon left and his son
[1:28:27] ream
[1:28:29] came praise the
[1:28:32] Lord because because you you see that's
[1:28:35] that that is the thing with with with
[1:28:37] wealth if you have it you got to keep it
[1:28:40] up that's the reason why the the the the
[1:28:43] man that has a he want more money
[1:28:46] because you got to keep it
[1:28:51] up
[1:28:53] and all of that but that's not what I
[1:28:54] want to go in tonight I'm just talking
[1:28:56] about Solomon in all of his glory and
[1:28:58] the brother Bram said yet as we as we
[1:29:00] read on on Sunday I'm going back to my
[1:29:03] to my my notes here on Sunday position
[1:29:05] in Christ he says we we should be so on
[1:29:08] fire of fire for God we should be
[1:29:11] goinging day and night nothing should be
[1:29:14] able to stop us and we should be so
[1:29:16] sweet so pleasant so kind so Christlike
[1:29:20] in our life it take
[1:29:23] everyday life Jesus said consider the
[1:29:26] lady of the field how it grows everyday
[1:29:29] life every day we must be looking for a
[1:29:34] growth every
[1:29:38] day it looks like every day we look for
[1:29:41] where we have filed the
[1:29:44] Lord then where his grace has helped
[1:29:50] us
[1:29:52] praise the Lord it looks like we driving
[1:29:54] this vehicle looking in the RAR view
[1:29:58] mirror and that's why we have in all of
[1:30:01] these
[1:30:03] scratches we have to be looking to him
[1:30:06] that is the Altar and the finisher of
[1:30:07] our
[1:30:12] faith how it grows tall and spin yet I
[1:30:17] said unto you Solomon in all of his
[1:30:19] glory is not a ray like one Solomon had
[1:30:24] robs that was RA with glorious skin and
[1:30:28] needle work in things but that wasn't
[1:30:32] what he was talking about see brother
[1:30:34] brother is saying that Jesus was not he
[1:30:38] was trying to get the people
[1:30:42] away from the physical
[1:30:47] glory to make them to see that the thing
[1:30:50] that was making the go to shine is the
[1:30:54] intelligence behind
[1:30:56] it praise the
[1:30:59] Lord the thing that was making the the
[1:31:02] the temple to be beautiful it was the
[1:31:05] glory than just the natural go and brid
[1:31:08] and saor the glory that was
[1:31:11] Hing in the in in the in in the
[1:31:17] temple but the people were admiring the
[1:31:20] the the go they were admiring the BR
[1:31:22] they were admiring the expensive thing
[1:31:24] but they were not seeing the glory
[1:31:28] right they were not seeing the
[1:31:31] glory that's the reason why when the
[1:31:33] glory departed Babylonians came men that
[1:31:38] were that were drunkers they would take
[1:31:40] the The Vessel of God to drink in it
[1:31:43] right praise the
[1:31:46] Lord that's what that's what happen when
[1:31:49] we are not seeing the
[1:31:50] glory
[1:31:53] then we subject ourself to to useless
[1:31:56] thoughts and useless things and and and
[1:31:58] and and and when when men are not seeing
[1:32:00] the the
[1:32:01] glory that is Hing in their
[1:32:06] life you give yourself to drugs and
[1:32:09] alcohol and sex and all of that
[1:32:12] enjoyment of life it goes away one night
[1:32:14] the next day you need
[1:32:20] it
[1:32:26] it was not the
[1:32:28] God it was not the all the sheers of
[1:32:31] gold and the Thousand sheeps and the Rob
[1:32:33] that he had it was the glory of God that
[1:32:36] came
[1:32:37] down just like the same Glory the people
[1:32:41] in the wilderness never had what Solomon
[1:32:43] had they were wearing the same clothes
[1:32:45] on their back that they came out of
[1:32:48] Egypt but the glory of God was there
[1:32:50] that it sustained their
[1:32:53] CLA the glory of God was down they never
[1:32:56] had a a medical facility but they had
[1:32:59] I'm the Lord that Health all your
[1:33:02] diseases and because the glory of God
[1:33:05] was in the
[1:33:06] camp they were drinking from uh from uh
[1:33:09] uh Branch water and all of that but God
[1:33:11] was keeping them
[1:33:13] healthy
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:23] are we
[1:33:26] together if we would just realize the
[1:33:28] glory of God that is Hing over our
[1:33:32] life that is Hing over our life that is
[1:33:35] keeping us healthy that is keeping us
[1:33:41] gring when we living in such a Time the
[1:33:44] prophet God says demon Spirits are
[1:33:47] streaming Up all In the
[1:33:50] Earth that menion dimensions of demon
[1:33:55] powers that science has given all sorts
[1:33:58] of scientific names for
[1:34:00] sicknesses right that the word has never
[1:34:03] seen before those are all demon
[1:34:06] powers praise the
[1:34:09] Lord that even some of the men that has
[1:34:11] the wealth of this
[1:34:13] word looking for where they can go to
[1:34:16] get
[1:34:16] healing and you are living in healing
[1:34:19] every day that's right
[1:34:22] every day you are living in
[1:34:24] healing praise the Lord right every day
[1:34:28] when you read the word of God you are
[1:34:30] taking in healing yes
[1:34:36] sir and yet we think it's a punishable
[1:34:40] life that we get so tired to read our
[1:34:43] Bible we think that it's a punishable
[1:34:46] life every day reading Bible every day
[1:34:49] Bible everyday Bible
[1:34:52] we think that it's a punishable
[1:34:55] life it's all because you have not seen
[1:34:58] the glory
[1:34:59] right you have not seen the glory you
[1:35:02] have not entered into
[1:35:11] it praise the
[1:35:18] Lord Solomon in all of his glory
[1:35:22] when he got
[1:35:24] down to
[1:35:26] idolatry with all of his wisdom to even
[1:35:30] know the question that were in the heart
[1:35:32] of a woman but yet he could not pick up
[1:35:35] the deception that were in the heart of
[1:35:37] all of those women that would lead him
[1:35:38] to to
[1:35:44] idolatry so what was God showing his
[1:35:47] glory was
[1:35:50] temporary his glory was temporary his
[1:35:53] knowledge was limited right even though
[1:35:56] there was no man that had knowledge like
[1:35:58] him yet his knowledge was limited it
[1:36:00] could not save him from
[1:36:03] adolat it could not help him to manage
[1:36:06] his 10,000 wives he had or thousand
[1:36:11] wives praise the Lord as the next part
[1:36:15] of that we were getting
[1:36:17] to are we together amen
[1:36:22] I was just I was talking to to a brother
[1:36:24] today that Pastor jam and we were
[1:36:27] talking about different thing I told him
[1:36:28] as as as Solomon had all of those wisdom
[1:36:32] but yet he couldn't handle women it
[1:36:34] don't take wisdom to handle
[1:36:37] women the Bible say husband love your
[1:36:40] wife didn't say be
[1:36:44] smart Solomon with all his wisdom he did
[1:36:47] not know how to handle a woman you have
[1:36:50] to know she has to make mystery of
[1:36:52] redemption you can't handle her by
[1:36:55] wisdom you have to handle her by the
[1:36:57] love of
[1:37:00] God praise the
[1:37:04] Lord if I can just get through one cot
[1:37:06] almost out of my time here tonight that
[1:37:09] was exactly where I stopped on Sunday so
[1:37:11] I don't know if I'm going to ever go any
[1:37:13] further than
[1:37:18] this that wasn't what he was talking
[1:37:20] about in order for the lady to grow a
[1:37:24] had to to both day and night praise the
[1:37:28] Lord like brother Bram like brother Bram
[1:37:31] would say you know like brother Bram
[1:37:33] would say you know I was when I was down
[1:37:35] over in Daisy uh we were over to uh uh
[1:37:38] uh one of the sisters house there she
[1:37:40] cooked some food so she cook uh uh uh
[1:37:44] she had a lot of lot of seful you know
[1:37:46] something kind of a seafood dish that
[1:37:48] she
[1:37:49] did so uh uh uh the uh the brothers some
[1:37:52] of the brothers they were you know they
[1:37:54] were just talking about CBE and talking
[1:37:56] about different things and you know all
[1:37:58] clams on and all of that I I don't even
[1:38:00] know why people eat that thing I I don't
[1:38:02] know what they eat so I told them I said
[1:38:04] I said to
[1:38:06] them I'm a man from the sea Co praise
[1:38:09] the Lord amen that's where my jam from
[1:38:12] even though I didn't grew up there but
[1:38:13] that's that's where my jam from my dad
[1:38:15] was a
[1:38:17] fisherman so I told him I say I says let
[1:38:20] me tell you anyway let me tell you
[1:38:22] something you know what brother BR said
[1:38:24] about taking the the the
[1:38:26] teaspoon of the ocean
[1:38:28] water he says every
[1:38:32] mineral that is in that
[1:38:35] ocean is in this
[1:38:38] teaspoon praise the Lord everything that
[1:38:41] the ocean I say so you see you see the
[1:38:44] the the the the the the the
[1:38:48] seafood that's what it has
[1:38:52] the the reason why the people that love
[1:38:55] SE the reason why they love it or the
[1:38:58] reason why they should love it is
[1:39:00] because of the
[1:39:02] mineral that it contains from under the
[1:39:06] ocean praise the Lord you find people
[1:39:09] that just spend their time on eating
[1:39:12] SE because they believe that in eating
[1:39:16] SE they will get the Min R out of
[1:39:19] it so like talks about the lady that it
[1:39:23] tolds in the mud he said that lady in
[1:39:25] the mud what is it doing with even
[1:39:29] though it's a dirty water it's a Moy
[1:39:32] water but but the lady spreads out her
[1:39:36] root to go and get the best substance
[1:39:41] the be best mining from the earth for
[1:39:44] that lady to be able to put out a flower
[1:39:48] where all the bees would come around to
[1:39:51] to pull
[1:39:52] from in the midst of the Dead water
[1:39:55] she's spreading out her root not caring
[1:39:58] what kind of a Messes in the water but
[1:40:00] she wants to get the mineral out of the
[1:40:04] earth she wants to get something
[1:40:09] valuable praise the
[1:40:11] Lord the only reason why you will fight
[1:40:15] a good Christian
[1:40:17] fight is because you believe that I have
[1:40:20] a more value out of this yes sir praise
[1:40:24] the Lord if you don't see the value I
[1:40:26] mean it's it's just a matter of time

[1:40:31] the shelf
[1:40:32] right all the men that have fought with
[1:40:35] all of their
[1:40:38] life is because they realize that there
[1:40:41] is a value the man that spend time in
[1:40:44] the word and in prayer in the presence
[1:40:47] of
[1:40:48] God they want to behold the glory of the
