[53:27] can I hear amen from you safe you can
[53:30] say it as loud as you want at all here
[53:32] right here Amen Alleluia yes you and all
[53:37] I was found Naomi's gonna have a special
[53:39] here in just a moment and I was at work
[53:44] here earlier this week and of course I
[53:47] always go to exercise over in cardiac
[53:50] rehab you have all the exercise
[53:51] equipment and I can go over there
[53:53] they've got the big-screen TVs there so
[53:56] I was like to get on and watch the news
[53:58] while I'm working out and there's been a
[54:01] couple of times this past week where I
[54:03] heard the the fellow on the broadcast
[54:07] say that 80% of the people are going to
[54:10] get this corona virus and you know what
[54:14] Saints that is a lie the devil if we
[54:19] could see into that other dimension what
[54:21] we do is we'd see that spirit standing
[54:23] behind the microphone saying guess what
[54:26] folks I'm going to plague 80% of you
[54:29] well I say when Satan comes in like a
[54:34] flood the scripture says God always
[54:38] raises a standard against it so Saints
[54:42] we don't have to accept that bag of
[54:44] rattlesnakes that they're actually
[54:46] broadcasting I just want to encourage
[54:49] each and every one of you to draw your
[54:51] swords stand on his promises praying for
[54:56] our people I know in this end time that
[54:58] we're going to have situations where we
[55:00] know even the scripture talks about
[55:02] different things happening but you know
[55:04] what he always will listen to a an
[55:07] earnest prayer from his children so we
[55:10] can stand against the enemy we don't
[55:12] have to accept that and so I just I just
[55:16] been praying I said Lord just put a
[55:18] hedge about the state of Minnesota I
[55:20] says that they could see that you're
[55:23] still the same yesterday today and
[55:25] forever and amen we don't have to
[55:27] believe that lie that Satan is
[55:29] broadcasting over the television in a
[55:33] radio station so oh my are you with me
[55:38] saints of God nice morning a man let's
[55:40] just agree in prayer to that so I think
[55:42] we ought to sing a song I think we sang
[55:45] last Sunday in the name of Jesus in the
[55:48] name of Jesus think about these words
[55:50] now before we sing it we have we have
[55:56] not will have we have it now the victory
[55:59] because Christ is our victory
[56:01] Satan is a defeated enemy in the name of
[56:04] Jesus in the name of Jesus what does
[56:07] that say up there
[56:08] demons have to flee
[56:13] demons have to flee so when we come in
[56:17] the name of Jesus
[56:18] Jamie Said's who can stand before in the
[56:23] precious name of Jesus we have the
[56:25] victory so let's sing it with all of our
[56:27] hearts in the name of Jesus in the name
[56:32] of Jesus we have the big door recall now
[56:38] in the name of Jesus in the name of
[56:42] Jesus all demons they have to flee
[56:48] now when we come in the name of Jesus
[56:53] tell me who can stand before in the
[56:59] precious name of Jesus we have the
[57:04] victory well in the name of Jesus in the
[57:11] name of Jesus we have the great story

[57:32] me who can stand before in the precious
[57:39] name of Jesus we have the Victoria
[57:46] and the people all said Amen Saints I
[57:52] just want you to all it does not make it
[57:54] feel good
[57:55] Oman makes me feel good we it says the
[57:58] scripture says that one will change the
[58:01] thousand and two ten thousand well I
[58:03] guess three would chase a hundred
[58:04] thousand and let's say four would be a
[58:07] million five more W ten million and on
[58:11] and on scenes of God so if you're all
[58:13] drawing your sorts today
[58:15] we'll just chase the enemy away because
[58:17] we are under our Lord's Authority amen
[58:20] and we can draw the sword and Satan's a
[58:23] defeated enemy and he's just a bluff

[1:18:09] a more popular song in such an hour
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:16] everybody is reading it and ministers
[1:18:21] are preaching on it and I want to try
[1:18:25] this morning to be able to speak on it
[1:18:28] but I will speak just read the first
[1:18:30] verse and then I will have us to have
[1:18:33] our seat and then we will just trust the
[1:18:36] law this morning to be able to help us
[1:18:39] amen
[1:18:43] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:18:47] the Most High shall abide under the
[1:18:51] shadow of the Almighty
[1:18:55] let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord
[1:18:58] we just come to you this morning we
[1:19:01] approach in your word by faith O God we
[1:19:05] want to make this word by faith this
[1:19:07] morning I pray Lord Jesus or God me you

[1:19:23] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Allah
[1:19:27] bless you you may have your seat
[1:19:29] and we will I never noticed it but
[1:19:32] writing mine in mind in my Bible that
[1:19:35] I'm reading from this little Bible I
[1:19:38] keep on the pulpit it it tied to some 91
[1:19:41] the secret place of the Most High and
[1:19:43] that's mine that's that's what I have on
[1:19:46] mine not to speak on this morning the
[1:19:48] secret place of the Most High so I can
[1:19:50] be comfortable this morning amen and I
[1:19:53] was just talking about it yesterday and
[1:19:55] brother area was at the house trying to
[1:19:58] pick up some things and visit with us a
[1:20:00] little bit and in the fact that he was
[1:20:03] also reading on the same thing so you
[1:20:05] know when the Lord brings those things
[1:20:06] around like that it kind of show your
[1:20:10] heart that I mean the Holy Spirit is
[1:20:12] moving in the same direction and I've
[1:20:14] seen a lot of brothers also speaking on
[1:20:16] the same thing but this morning I want
[1:20:19] to look at the secret place of the Most
[1:20:22] High now this is the direction I want to
[1:20:24] go in as many as we all talk about this
[1:20:27] subject and we read about this now you
[1:20:30] think about it this way the minds of
[1:20:33] everybody is looking for a hiding place
[1:20:36] amen
[1:20:37] hiding under the shadow of the Almighty
[1:20:40] a place of refuge that we can run Toto
[1:20:44] high but the thing about the year is
[1:20:47] there David is talking about the secret
[1:20:50] place now your secret place but the
[1:20:53] secret place of the Most High so the one
[1:20:57] that is hiding in this hour is not you
[1:21:03] the one that is looking for a hiding
[1:21:06] place is the most high praise the Lord
[1:21:10] and what my inspiration is coming from
[1:21:13] is dead
[1:21:14] when the prophet of God came down to
[1:21:17] preach the seals he talks about a God
[1:21:20] that is held in simplicity praise the
[1:21:26] Lord the Old Testament from the
[1:21:28] beginning over in the book of Exodus in
[1:21:32] honor Moses it speaks about a City of
[1:21:36] Refuge and it speaks about a provider
[1:21:40] place that God has provided
[1:21:42] for his people to run to and hi but when
[1:21:46] we came over to the old testament I mean
[1:21:49] the New Testament we will realize even
[1:21:51] from the birth of Jesus Christ that
[1:21:54] right there it was God I was looking for
[1:21:56] a hiding place he was looking for a
[1:22:00] place to be born he was looking for a
[1:22:03] place to hide himself so on a shadow and
[1:22:10] in times through the Old Testament God
[1:22:13] sure how he had provided a place and it
[1:22:18] looks like a place for his people but in
[1:22:21] the New Testament a turn out to be he
[1:22:23] was the one or he is the one now that is
[1:22:28] looking for places to hide
[1:22:32] praise the Lord
[1:22:33] so we were taught about the secret place
[1:22:36] of the Most High not now your secret
[1:22:40] place but God's secret place I mean God
[1:22:43] is looking for the people and I can
[1:22:45] assure to you that God has got a people
[1:22:48] that's what I want to say this morning
[1:22:50] that God has got a people and and and
[1:22:54] some of the reason of all of these
[1:22:56] things that is happening us we'll look
[1:22:58] into the scripture is that God want to
[1:23:01] assure his bride God want to bring you
[1:23:04] to the place and said look I've got you
[1:23:07] I've got a place that I'm hiding myself
[1:23:10] you are that place praise the Lord
[1:23:18] he's bringing his bride talk to a place
[1:23:22] for her to be able to value all the
[1:23:25] words she be feeding on for her to value
[1:23:30] the Holy Ghost I've been leading her and
[1:23:32] guiding her Sophie Annette there's a man
[1:23:38] here that can turn on the light we have
[1:23:42] to realize that even that little girl
[1:23:46] the man I was that was there to turn on
[1:23:49] the light he was not somewhere as he was
[1:23:51] right in the darkness with her he was
[1:23:55] not in an
[1:23:56] engine room somewhere he was right in
[1:23:58] the elevator the engineer he was right
[1:24:03] in the situation with her you man I can
[1:24:08] turn on this slide the man I can turn
[1:24:10] this situation this ride is right in it
[1:24:13] with us he was not out of the fire
[1:24:16] furnace with Shadrach Meshach and
[1:24:18] Abednego he was right there he was not
[1:24:21] out of the lion den he was right in the
[1:24:23] lion's den with Daniel and he's right in
[1:24:28] this with us amen
[1:24:31] if you even look at it in in in the lion
[1:24:36] den the one that we could see was down
[1:24:39] here in the midst of the lion but there
[1:24:43] was one that was hiding it was Jehovah
[1:24:46] in the fire fundage you could see the
[1:24:50] three Hebrew boys thrown in the fire but
[1:24:53] there was one that was hiding so there
[1:24:57] is one that is hiding in this situation
[1:25:01] and that's the one we want to talk about
[1:25:03] this this this morning by the grace of
[1:25:06] God amen
[1:25:07] let's study a little bit second samuel
[1:25:10] chapter 24 let's go back and look at the
[1:25:13] background of this sam second samuel
[1:25:17] chapter 24
[1:25:31] praise the Lord second samuel chapter 24
[1:25:41] second samuel chapter 24 will bring us
[1:25:44] to this place of the plague that struck
[1:25:50] israel and this will set us it was set a
[1:25:54] good background for this Sam ninety-one
[1:25:58] after reading this you can read an
[1:26:01] entire chapter home and you go back and
[1:26:03] read some chapter 91 you would get the
[1:26:05] picture of why they we pray that prayer
[1:26:10] chapter 24
[1:26:13] second Samuel is that what I said okay
[1:26:17] and again the anger of the Lord was
[1:26:23] candor against Israel and he moved David
[1:26:29] against him to say go number Israel and
[1:26:34] Judah first Chronicle
[1:26:37] 21
[1:26:51] we just want to study a little bit in an
[1:26:54] established I taught here before we go
[1:26:57] forward nanny in second Samuel it's
[1:27:04] written there the anger of the Lord was
[1:27:07] kinda against Israel over in first
[1:27:11] chronicle and sit on stood up against
[1:27:16] Israel and provoked David to number the
[1:27:22] people Amen
[1:27:23] to normal Israel now you know through
[1:27:29] many account it looks like these are
[1:27:31] conflicting but there is there is
[1:27:34] something that is that it's major year
[1:27:36] is dead God was not happy with Israel I
[1:27:43] mean the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:27:46] against Israel but for God's judgment to
[1:27:51] come on the people it has to come from
[1:27:57] the failure or the weakness of he
[1:28:01] elected one he was not happy with the
[1:28:06] people but for him to bring a judgment
[1:28:10] on them he had to move David to a
[1:28:15] compromise on his word now if you if you
[1:28:20] follow you will realize that when the
[1:28:24] the pledge when the judgment will come
[1:28:27] it would not come on David it will come
[1:28:31] on the people praise the Lord and over
[1:28:36] in first chronicle as we will read a
[1:28:40] little bit and David said unto Joab and
[1:28:44] told the rulers of the people go number
[1:28:47] Israel from Beersheba on to them and
[1:28:50] bring the number of them to mean in that
[1:28:55] I mean know it wish of course Joe
[1:28:59] advised him that a Lord make his people
[1:29:03] and a hundred times
[1:29:05] so many more as they be but the Lord my
[1:29:09] lord King and then that all my lord
[1:29:14] seven why then do my lord require this
[1:29:18] thing why why will he be a cause of
[1:29:23] trespass in Israel praise the Lord
[1:29:30] now remember now the anger of the Lord
[1:29:34] was kindled against Israel but yet David
[1:29:41] is the one that is going to trespass to
[1:29:44] bring God's judgment on the people
[1:29:47] nevertheless the King were prevailed
[1:29:50] against your work for Joab departed and
[1:29:52] went throughout all Israel and came to
[1:29:57] Jerusalem praise the Lord
[1:30:00] let's drop down a little bit there to
[1:30:03] verse 7 and God was displeased with this
[1:30:06] thing therefore he smart Israel and
[1:30:12] David said unto God I have seen a
[1:30:16] greatly because I have done this thing
[1:30:19] but now I beseech thee do a way the
[1:30:27] iniquity of the seven for I have done
[1:30:30] very foolishly
[1:30:32] and the Lord speak unto God David see
[1:30:38] you're saying go tell David saying thus
[1:30:41] saith the Lord are awful three of the
[1:30:45] three things
[1:30:45] choose the one of them that I may do it
[1:30:49] unto thee and gal came to David and said
[1:30:55] unto Him thus said the Lord choosing
[1:30:57] either three years farming or three
[1:31:02] months or to be destroy three months to
[1:31:08] be the strong before thy fall why the
[1:31:13] sward of thine enemy overtake thee or s3
[1:31:18] dey's watch all the trees now three days
[1:31:22] the swore of the Lord even the
[1:31:26] pestilence in the lane and the angel of
[1:31:30] the Lord
[1:31:31] destroying throughout all the course of
[1:31:34] Israel
[1:31:35] now therefore advise themselves what
[1:31:39] word I should bring again to him that
[1:31:41] sent me and David said unto God I am in
[1:31:45] a great Street let me fall down into the
[1:31:50] hands of the law for very great his
[1:31:55] mercy but let me not fall into the hands
[1:31:59] of men so the Lord sent pestilence upon
[1:32:03] Israel and there fell of Israel seventy
[1:32:10] thousand men praise the Lord amen now
[1:32:15] this will also help us to understand
[1:32:18] when brother Branham says and Sarah
[1:32:21] laughs right in the face of the angel
[1:32:24] that came to bring her the the news and
[1:32:29] Jehovah visiting her and he acts Abraham
[1:32:34] world's your wife Sarah and I mean she
[1:32:37] was right there in a tent and God knew
[1:32:39] where she word and he knew know
[1:32:41] everything that was happening but like
[1:32:43] the Prophet said God could not destroy
[1:32:45] he could not George Sarah he could not
[1:32:48] occur Sarah because he was just at a
[1:32:50] time of fulfilling his world now see
[1:32:54] this man David he's a man after God's
[1:32:56] own heart amen
[1:32:58] a man a king that God has raised up
[1:33:00] trained at the backside of the desert we
[1:33:03] know all the stories about it and all
[1:33:05] the trials that he have gone through
[1:33:07] even after suffering under the hand of
[1:33:10] Saul and then on his own failure with
[1:33:14] their Sheba and everything now David is
[1:33:16] almost at the end of his ministry but we
[1:33:21] realize here from the scripture as the
[1:33:24] scripture addressed us you know this
[1:33:27] looks like a father as seen of David in
[1:33:30] everybody
[1:33:31] we all look at Davi he nom other people
[1:33:33] he did wrong and all of that is true
[1:33:36] that's why the Word of God says but we
[1:33:38] have to realize from the beginning year
[1:33:40] the anger of the Lord was Kanda against
[1:33:44] Israel praise the Lord and we look into
[1:33:49] the world today and see all the things
[1:33:51] that is happening in a meaning and the
[1:33:53] different rise in the evil and and
[1:33:56] atheism in all of the things the ungodly
[1:33:59] things that is happening is just enough
[1:34:02] to bring God's judgment upon this world
[1:34:05] but we also have to realize that's a
[1:34:08] group of people that are on the earth
[1:34:10] now by God's Word must not go through
[1:34:13] the judgment of God must not go true
[1:34:16] that the tribulation now for God to be
[1:34:20] able to bring his judgment upon this
[1:34:23] word for all the evil the man is doing
[1:34:26] he had to set these people right he had
[1:34:30] to create things to be able to bring us
[1:34:34] to our place because we have to be out
[1:34:37] of here before the Great Tribulation
[1:34:38] comes
[1:34:40] praise the Lord I had a brother saying
[1:34:43] you know people are saying now well they
[1:34:45] said the brow when I go through the
[1:34:47] tribulation the bride is going through
[1:34:48] the tribulation I said well ok somebody
[1:34:51] is having an idea but I don't think that
[1:34:54] is God's will praise the Lord but that's
[1:34:57] what I'm trying to bring to us this
[1:35:00] morning you read through the scripture
[1:35:02] the Bible says 7,000 me and you look at
[1:35:08] it in a context of the world they hang
[1:35:13] out of the Lord I was candid against
[1:35:14] Israel the scripture did not see the
[1:35:17] anger of the law was candid against
[1:35:18] David you know but David was the gateway
[1:35:23] for God to be able to bring this George
[1:35:26] made upon the people he had to create
[1:35:28] some weakness upon his elected 7in sit
[1:35:34] on moved David just like bar Branham
[1:35:39] says the last their spirit is upon the
[1:35:41] people it's even affecting us
[1:35:45] we are backsliding on God and we are
[1:35:47] making excuses on God and and and and I
[1:35:51] mean we are neglecting God's Word when
[1:35:56] it's almost about a time word he should
[1:35:58] take his bride out of here we are
[1:36:02] waiting for that last elected one we are
[1:36:04] waiting for every member to find their
[1:36:06] place in the body praise the Lord
[1:36:11] just like he did to Jacob in the house
[1:36:16] of Leben he had to create some
[1:36:19] discomfort for Jacob to desire that is
[1:36:26] time to go back home just like he did
[1:36:30] with the Jews he had to create a
[1:36:34] discomfort that we call the the
[1:36:38] Holocaust for them to go back to their
[1:36:41] homeland and brother Branham says that
[1:36:45] was the tender hand of Jehovah and God
[1:36:48] will always do that now as we come to
[1:36:53] the end of the scripture there is
[1:36:55] something also that I want us to realize
[1:36:58] such David comes to the end of this he
[1:37:01] cried before God the scripture says I
[1:37:03] mean people are falling you read down in
[1:37:05] Psalm 91 David says and you know a
[1:37:10] thousand four by the writing in this one
[1:37:13] for about eleven it never came not him
[1:37:15] and then it was the same one crying
[1:37:18] before guarding and supplicating before
[1:37:21] God and saying O God your people he said
[1:37:25] let this thing come on me in my father's
[1:37:29] house praise the Lord
[1:37:33] but as the angel of the Lord and God
[1:37:37] came back to David and to tell him God
[1:37:40] was about to stop the plague the angel
[1:37:44] went right down to the thrashing floor
[1:37:46] of owner as we come down to to the end
[1:37:52] of there we will realize Davey realize
[1:37:58] when he got down there and that Jabba's
[1:38:01] eyes was about to offer him the place he
[1:38:04] loved Evie
[1:38:05] he knew that he was a man after God's
[1:38:08] own heart in you what he knew that David
[1:38:10] was going through at distressing time
[1:38:13] his people dying all over the place I
[1:38:16] said David if I can just do this for you
[1:38:19] you can have it David said I would not
[1:38:23] give anything to the Lord that cost me
[1:38:26] nothing
[1:38:28] praise the Lord
[1:38:31] it's not a place word he's he realized
[1:38:35] that he needs to step up his commitment
[1:38:41] he needs to step up his dedication to
[1:38:46] God he says I won't give anything to the
[1:38:50] Lord I won't make anything to the Lord
[1:38:52] that will not cost me if I would give
[1:38:56] anything to God it had to cost me
[1:38:58] something because I did something to
[1:39:02] bring this evil upon my people praise
[1:39:07] the Lord so that there was just a little
[1:39:11] bit to give us a background what I think
[1:39:13] relates to some 91 amen David was in his
[1:39:20] palace and in all of these things
[1:39:22] happening around him I believe he's
[1:39:24] there crying out to God on behalf of the
[1:39:29] people but just like I said what I'm
[1:39:32] looking at this this this morning it's
[1:39:36] Ned you know it's I mean it's all over
[1:39:39] the internet it's all over the radio and
[1:39:41] all the preachers I promising people the
[1:39:44] hiding place the most hiding place that
[1:39:47] we have is to run into Christ and run
[1:39:49] into Christ but this morning I don't
[1:39:53] want to be different what I want to say
[1:39:56] there God but this way it is coming to
[1:40:01] assure his bride that he's been hiding
[1:40:04] in her
[1:40:07] praise the Lord I want us to look at a
[1:40:10] word year that I was looking at the
[1:40:15] scripture says he that dwelleth in the
[1:40:22] secret of the Most High
[1:40:26] praise the Lord amen
[1:40:29] he that dwelleth in a secret of the Most
[1:40:33] High now I was looking at that word to
[1:40:42] do it
[1:40:44] Jesus says if you do already meaning my
[1:40:47] word abide in you if your body me my
[1:40:49] word bothering you the same as dwelling
[1:40:52] and I came across this someone shared
[1:40:58] this with me and and this this is what
[1:41:02] kind of a trick of this whole talk to me
[1:41:04] looking at the word here there's a word
[1:41:07] that speaks in a sense of weakness and
[1:41:15] that word is a Greek word spell or I K
[1:41:20] or s it means dwelling or a means house
[1:41:30] it's a word that derived from a Greek
[1:41:33] word that means dwelling or it means
[1:41:36] house now I was looking at that word
[1:41:43] this morning a little bit and I realized
[1:41:54] that it's a word that has that has
[1:41:58] lingered a little bit in the English in
[1:42:00] in in the English word it was this world
[1:42:04] was also called the Eternals
[1:42:08] Lord it was used there in you know
[1:42:14] Scotland and different part of the word
[1:42:16] it says you will find
[1:42:19] the instant classified in three main
[1:42:23] division this word noun is instantly
[1:42:25] classified in three million division at
[1:42:28] first first it means a house and
[1:42:32] sometime all the kinds of dwelling and
[1:42:36] secondly it will speak also of a
[1:42:39] household household ghouls in substance
[1:42:45] for which as I greatly said property
[1:42:49] they use their world also to classify
[1:42:53] property entirely it also speaks of the
[1:42:57] sense of a family now before I kind of
[1:43:02] come down to this I wanted to speak on
[1:43:04] on something I will not go ahead of
[1:43:07] myself let me just stay where I am
[1:43:09] before I get myself confused now so we
[1:43:12] see a three four distension of this word
[1:43:16] that speaks of a house it speaks of a
[1:43:22] house or a building that's one he speaks
[1:43:26] of everything that is within the house
[1:43:28] household goals it also have to do with
[1:43:33] family now you go back to exeter you
[1:43:37] will realize when God told Moses to
[1:43:40] build a tabernacle his desire was to do
[1:43:45] it among his people his desire was to do
[1:43:51] it and the deep sense was to inhabit so
[1:43:56] in Old Testament honor the shadow he
[1:43:59] dwelled among his people but God's
[1:44:02] intent was to inhabit his people now
[1:44:08] giving their instruction to Moses he
[1:44:12] told Moses that I will make my people a
[1:44:15] priesthood god intention was a family a
[1:44:20] priesthood family not just one tribe not
[1:44:23] just one group of people but an entire
[1:44:26] Israel was going to be a family of
[1:44:28] priesthood
[1:44:31] and his intention was to do it he that
[1:44:37] dwelleth in the secret of the Most High
[1:44:40] and the thing about this word also there
[1:44:45] is the other it means you know uh the
[1:44:52] the world week they also speak of a week
[1:44:55] of vessel you know this world week that
[1:44:59] speak of a week of a so that's what draw
[1:45:01] this this Greek word we are looking at
[1:45:04] and that's meaning a dwelling place now
[1:45:08] you take it in the context of god's word
[1:45:10] his train is made perfect in our
[1:45:14] weakness
[1:45:15] so he'd word in our weakness to show his
[1:45:19] strength is when we surrender our
[1:45:22] weakness to him he can come and ward in
[1:45:25] it ensure that he's a deliverer he's a
[1:45:28] healer and and he's a mighty conquer we
[1:45:31] have two ceramic our weakness to him and
[1:45:35] then if you also look at the top of this
[1:45:38] word you will realize there even when
[1:45:45] when when moses build the tabernacle
[1:45:47] that God was going to do it in all the
[1:45:53] entrance of the tabernacle he never
[1:45:56] asked that Moses you put a steel door he
[1:46:03] asked the Moses you pour curtains
[1:46:07] he poured Badgers king praise the Lord
[1:46:13] so I would tell you that great men
[1:46:17] warriors people in old war tactics when
[1:46:24] I want to hide himself they don't hide
[1:46:26] himself on a great you know castle and
[1:46:31] great the holy place is some of the most
[1:46:35] common place the reason is because in in
[1:46:40] in such a time of war everybody is
[1:46:44] thinking about
[1:46:45] protecting himself so the go and hide
[1:46:49] himself in the most common place a place
[1:46:54] that I will not be looking like it's a
[1:46:57] queue
[1:46:59] praise the Lord brother branham talks
[1:47:03] about his cave and the way he destroy
[1:47:05] his cave it was not that's the reason
[1:47:08] why he said it would not be so easy for
[1:47:10] anybody to find it because it was not
[1:47:13] too difficult to find it was a common
[1:47:16] place praise the Lord
[1:47:21] it was a common place and you check also
[1:47:26] in in in the scripture you realize even
[1:47:32] David then scripture there first samuel
[1:47:35] 19 this was when David told Janet on
[1:47:41] that your father's secret to kill me and
[1:47:43] Jonathan says why would he do that
[1:47:46] David says well that I just think
[1:47:49] there's something not right here
[1:47:50] Jonathan say okay I will go over and if
[1:47:54] I find out that he want to kill you I'm
[1:47:56] going to shoot an arrow and go to your
[1:47:59] secret place the reason why you think
[1:48:03] about it this was the army of Israel
[1:48:06] that I was looking for David the reason
[1:48:10] why they could not find him his hiding
[1:48:12] place was just simple places the army in
[1:48:18] their mind will be thinking about a
[1:48:21] great term
[1:48:22] you know please they will be thinking
[1:48:25] about well I know a shelter some words
[1:48:28] well I think he has gone to this place
[1:48:31] and David would just go on a wound rock
[1:48:34] inhye himself even when he came by to
[1:48:39] cut saw a garment he was hiding not too
[1:48:42] far from soul praise the Lord he was
[1:48:48] hiding not too far from Saul when I mean
[1:48:52] I'm thinking about you know who I think
[1:48:56] I know not of the fire
[1:48:57] he might be in a valid David was just
[1:49:00] somewhere not too far as a shepherd boy
[1:49:07] he knew how to get in the common place
[1:49:11] praise the Lord
[1:49:13] you asked hunters hunters would tell you
[1:49:16] the very same thing they know how to get
[1:49:21] in a common place and hide himself the
[1:49:29] secret of the Almighty
[1:49:33] praise the Lord the secret of the
[1:49:37] Almighty you think about it Almighty God
[1:49:40] the secret I he have held back from the
[1:49:43] foundation of the world he came and
[1:49:45] revealed it just in a humble simple
[1:49:49] Tabernacle to a simple group of people
[1:49:55] praise the Lord
[1:49:57] the word everybody stuck in their homes
[1:50:01] and trying to make their homes a safe
[1:50:03] place and people are reviving their
[1:50:08] commitment with God he's he's our refuge
[1:50:12] in the time of help we are running
[1:50:14] through Jesus when he's the one that
[1:50:17] been looking for a hiding place out of
[1:50:19] this wine to hide in the hearts of his
[1:50:26] little bride that's the reason why the
[1:50:29] Prophet can bring us a consolation
[1:50:31] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:50:33] light he has been here all of this wine
[1:50:35] he's with this bride praise the Lord
[1:50:43] he's with this bride we I mean we are at
[1:50:47] a place word we have to start looking
[1:50:49] within looking and seeing all the things
[1:50:52] that he have done all through these
[1:50:54] years no people want to pump themself on
[1:50:58] down to to fasting I you know I tell all
[1:51:02] Jesus we need you we he's been here all
[1:51:05] of this wine he's been hiding behind
[1:51:09] these common services
[1:51:11] his comic conventions you meeting in all
[1:51:14] of these things he's been hiding
[1:51:15] dwelling with his bride we are talking
[1:51:24] about the secret place of the Most High
[1:51:30] praise the Lord
[1:51:35] the secret place of the Most High I was
[1:51:38] looking at another word it's a Greek
[1:51:41] word - and they have to do with weakness
[1:51:47] it says to resist no longer but to give
[1:51:54] a way to yield and I realize that
[1:52:00] sometimes you find people and they tell
[1:52:04] you about the weakness in their lives
[1:52:07] you know this is my weakness this is you
[1:52:11] know this this thing is my weakness and
[1:52:13] this thing is my weakness they talk
[1:52:15] about their weakness but actually when
[1:52:17] if if you just pause if you just fix
[1:52:20] that thing you'll realize that thing has
[1:52:24] been strong in that individual life I
[1:52:27] mean just like the scripture says he
[1:52:31] that cover his sin will not prosper and
[1:52:35] because people take these things as
[1:52:38] their weakness they find comfort in it
[1:52:41] they make excuses in it actually it's a
[1:52:44] strong word it's a strong wall and you
[1:52:49] realize that's the place where the devil
[1:52:51] is pinning you down because that's the
[1:52:59] reason why the scripture teaches us for
[1:53:02] us to confess our weakness and suppose
[1:53:04] the weakness resist it I mean when you
[1:53:09] can resist no longer and you're able to
[1:53:14] give away you are able to yield to the
[1:53:16] authority of God's Word to submit to
[1:53:21] give it to cast down before his feet
[1:53:25] if net that thing would become a
[1:53:28] stronghold it will become a mattre
[1:53:31] fortress in your life and the one that
[1:53:35] will be hiding behind it is the devil
[1:53:37] amen
[1:53:38] he's trying to use that thing you call
[1:53:41] your weakness as his fortress he's
[1:53:46] trying to hide behind it because you
[1:53:51] will not ceramic it because you will net
[1:53:53] you know you you I mean you net you and
[1:53:56] I give it away some people you know
[1:54:05] tempura is my weakness and there are
[1:54:09] very weakness they are talking about
[1:54:11] when they get angry they can break this
[1:54:13] building there and this is oh my
[1:54:16] goodness that's my weakness it's because
[1:54:21] you are keeping a strong man behind you
[1:54:26] keeping a strong man behind that
[1:54:28] weakness but you see when we when we
[1:54:33] surround our weakness and we confess our
[1:54:37] weakness and expose it to Christ when he
[1:54:40] can't bend his strength become perfect
[1:54:44] in that weakness then he becomes the
[1:54:47] strong man behind our weakness not
[1:54:50] condemning you I mean but convicting you
[1:54:54] and instructing you and comforting you
[1:54:58] whenever the thought of that is coming
[1:55:01] whenever the feeling of that is coming
[1:55:04] you go right back to the word you go
[1:55:06] right back to his promises praise the
[1:55:10] Lord the secret place of the Most High
[1:55:17] look at a larger in a time or farming
[1:55:24] word they go fine as a secret place for
[1:55:28] Elijah was a widow woman a widow woman
[1:55:34] and her son with the alas bread is that
[1:55:37] a strong place to send a prophet
[1:55:41] in a place of drought is that a place to
[1:55:44] send somebody in a natural mind that is
[1:55:47] just being cruel to the natural mind
[1:55:51] that's weakness saying that the very man
[1:55:55] that pronounced the judgment on the lane
[1:55:58] sending him to the house of a widow with
[1:56:01] her last meal
[1:56:03] God always hide behind weakness
[1:56:09] human weakness is his hiding place
[1:56:11] because that's what he brings his
[1:56:14] strength that's what he brings a
[1:56:16] delivery that's where he performed
[1:56:18] miracle
[1:56:21] Elijah where was his hiding place in the
[1:56:25] house of a barren woman a woman I tried
[1:56:29] to do right she lived right never had a
[1:56:32] child in all her life four year God who
[1:56:38] put a burden on her heart to build a
[1:56:41] chamber for his prophet I'm talking
[1:56:43] about God hiding place while the word is
[1:56:47] looking for the hiding play because that
[1:56:49] was the same thing at the birth of Jesus
[1:56:51] everybody was looking for a place to
[1:56:52] lodge they were looking for their good
[1:56:54] room to sleep in and a good place and he
[1:56:57] never had a place to be born he had to
[1:57:01] choose and stable to be born in because
[1:57:04] all the rooms were filled and now
[1:57:06] everybody is looking for the hiding
[1:57:08] place and we not even thinking about a
[1:57:10] place that he wants to hide everybody is
[1:57:17] looking for a safe place in and I mean
[1:57:20] God had just brought the world to a stop
[1:57:23] and said thing about it there is no
[1:57:25] nation that is safe because this plague
[1:57:29] coronaviruses everywhere just bringing
[1:57:33] us to the place to realize we cannot
[1:57:35] deal our hopes on earthly things we
[1:57:40] cannot build our hopes on affluent
[1:57:42] nations we cannot build our hopes on our
[1:57:45] earthly homes there is no every place
[1:57:49] that is safe
[1:57:51] praise the Lord the Savior's place is
[1:57:55] the place that God is hiding amen
[1:58:03] David was God's man even his God was
[1:58:09] bringing his judgment because on a
[1:58:14] shadow and types he was dwelling with
[1:58:18] that man after his own heart he would
[1:58:21] not touch him out of these things I'm
[1:58:30] not trying to say it is the bride that
[1:58:31] is bringing this thing on the earth but
[1:58:33] I'm trying to say this is to bring us to
[1:58:36] a wake-up call because Brad Branham trot
[1:58:41] out before the seal that God was hiding
[1:58:46] in simplicity and that simple place that
[1:58:50] God was going to high in was his bride
[1:58:55] that simple place that he was going to
[1:58:57] hide in was his bride right before the
[1:59:01] seals brother Branham give I mean the
[1:59:04] Lord giving sisters in a tabernacle
[1:59:08] dream about the very same seals that
[1:59:10] will be revealed brothers in the
[1:59:12] tabernacle dream about very seen seals
[1:59:15] that was going to be revealed a junior
[1:59:19] Jackson in all of these people while I
[1:59:22] was gone doing that even before the
[1:59:27] seals were revealed he was trying to
[1:59:30] show that this dispensation is God
[1:59:35] dwelling among his people even if you
[1:59:40] will use the Prophet to bring us a
[1:59:41] revelation and interpretation God and
[1:59:44] now seal yourself in one man God is
[1:59:48] dwelling in his people his people is his
[1:59:51] household his people is his hiding place
[1:59:57] that is the reason why I says people as
[1:59:59] his bride we need to wake up and behave
[2:00:02] ourself
[2:00:04] kick our self out of this fear and kick
[2:00:07] our self out of this carelessness in
[2:00:09] thinking that you notice the people out
[2:00:11] there we are here for the reason and and
[2:00:13] all of these things is happening for the
[2:00:15] reason this is time to clean up God's
[2:00:18] hiding place to take all the warden s
[2:00:23] and all the filthiness out of God's
[2:00:25] hiding place all the ungodliness out of
[2:00:35] God's hiding place where Branham talks
[2:00:38] about this bride gets into a place to
[2:00:41] speak the word how would we ever get to
[2:00:44] that place not in our own strength God
[2:00:47] has to be a body in our tabernacle
[2:01:01] praise the Lord the secret place of the
[2:01:08] Most High is the most high secret place
[2:01:10] that we are talking about if you can
[2:01:12] find a secret place of the Most High
[2:01:14] abide in it you can realize that God has
[2:01:18] chosen your tabernacle God has set you
[2:01:22] aside out of these years for this very
[2:01:25] hour that we are in we are getting to
[2:01:30] the place of our showdown we have gone
[2:01:33] through trials we have gone through
[2:01:35] different doctrines we have gone through
[2:01:37] different waves of the message but he
[2:01:41] have kept us for this hour because the
[2:01:46] prophet of God spoke about it we're
[2:01:50] missing link will be restored were the
[2:01:54] people of God will be able to see God
[2:01:59] visiting them in their homes praise the
[2:02:04] Lord I was thinking about it just
[2:02:07] driving to church you know if we if we
[2:02:12] have a you know you know all of this you
[2:02:16] know time of going to working in
[2:02:18] different basic thing we haven't and
[2:02:20] sometimes in some homes you know people
[2:02:23] just use that as an escape because they
[2:02:27] can stand their wives and they can stand
[2:02:32] a husband and they can or they can stay
[2:02:34] in their children they just used that
[2:02:35] for an escape praise the Lord
[2:02:38] and if God would give us this little
[2:02:40] window for us to catch ourselves and say
[2:02:43] what is that thing that I can deal with
[2:02:45] let me deal with it now let me be able
[2:02:49] to stay right there for the proper God
[2:02:53] says they are intend of mate the vial is
[2:02:57] on to death after year we cross over and
[2:03:01] we hold one another hands right in a
[2:03:03] millennium if he's giving us this little
[2:03:08] winner there those those are those are
[2:03:10] the little things for us to be able to
[2:03:13] appreciate our home
[2:03:14] imagine the dwelling-place speaks of the
[2:03:16] family and a man would think or a woman
[2:03:21] would think she more spiritual than her
[2:03:23] husband or the man would think he had
[2:03:24] the Holy Ghost and his wife don't have
[2:03:26] the Holy Ghost and all of these things
[2:03:28] you know this is salvation it's an
[2:03:30] individual effect when it comes down to
[2:03:32] this rapture it's a family affair it's a
[2:03:37] family affair and man must be able to
[2:03:42] have confidence in his wife faith the
[2:03:44] wife must be able to have confidence in
[2:03:46] the hosmer faith they also confidence in

[2:13:56] against his bride he want to come to
[2:14:05] your little house no matter how old is
[2:14:09] your house that does not matter with him
[2:14:11] no matter if your house you notice it's
[2:14:14] now furnished like the house of this
[2:14:16] world is now matter with God what he's
[2:14:20] looking for is that atmosphere that work
[2:14:24] on his spirit not a home where you will
[2:14:27] be proud and pick up your newspaper but
[2:14:30] urban MC and just leave him in the
[2:14:31] corner he never felt welcome in Simon's
[2:14:34] house the hiding place of the Almighty
[2:14:44] let just think about that it's a
[2:14:49] household
[2:14:50] it's a family this bride is a family
[2:14:54] like I've said over and over we will
[2:14:57] never succeed as a church until we have
[2:15:00] the revelation that the Church of Jesus
[2:15:02] Christ is the family of God and when we
[2:15:06] started treat one another and not taking
[2:15:08] lightly when we say brother days and
[2:15:10] insists of this and realize that it is
[2:15:13] of one blood God has saved all of us and
[2:15:15] he has brought us to this body to be a
[2:15:19] family to be a support system to one
[2:15:26] another
[2:15:28] praise the Lord if this is the place
[2:15:31] that we choose to bring our family bring
[2:15:35] our wives and children this is the place
[2:15:42] that we choose to grow in faith and we
[2:15:48] know that we have an obligation to keep
[2:15:51] it as the house of God there's no reason
[2:15:53] of running gossip and running you know
[2:15:56] creating differences in in complicating
[2:15:59] ourself in our own talk because all of
[2:16:01] those things does not matter to God what
[2:16:04] do you think and how you feel that is
[2:16:05] supposed to be a does not matter to God
[2:16:07] because his church is a mystical body he
[2:16:12] knows what he's doing

[2:16:41] never told his people to use baths and
[2:16:43] ions to protect the holy place because
[2:16:51] he knows he's the protector all he need
[2:16:54] to do is just come in he's the sustainer
[2:16:58] that's why he did you don't ask you to
