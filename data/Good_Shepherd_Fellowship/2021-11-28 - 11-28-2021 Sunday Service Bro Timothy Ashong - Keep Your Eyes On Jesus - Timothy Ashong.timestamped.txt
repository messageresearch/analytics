[12:31] understanding would just flood over our

[16:27] give a quick little
[16:30] tribute to our dear brother that's going
[16:32] on to
[16:34] glory okay three minutes you said
[16:38] all right um
[16:40] you know i remember when i was really
[16:42] young
[16:43] and
[16:47] ever since i can remember my mother i
[16:50] can remember my brother i can remember
[16:53] my father and everybody i could remember
[16:55] brother scott and a lot of you here
[16:58] you know he was always in my life since
[17:00] i was a little kid and even i remember
[17:01] when we
[17:02] kind of stopped coming here for a while
[17:06] and we got in a car accident that was
[17:07] really bad
[17:09] you know my brother over there broke his
[17:10] back and
[17:12] another person flew out the car and
[17:14] everything
[17:15] he came to the house you know and he was
[17:18] speaking to us and talking to us
[17:20] like we just spoke yesterday or
[17:22] something and
[17:23] just the type of love that he had for
[17:26] people it was so
[17:27] so heartwarming
[17:30] and i actually have a testimony of how
[17:32] god really used him
[17:35] right before he took him on
[17:38] and it was when i first came back to
[17:39] church i you know i would sit down over
[17:41] there and
[17:42] i would hear brother lawrence and the
[17:44] other song service leader you know
[17:46] called people up to pray and i belong
[17:47] okay they just called brother jordan up
[17:49] to prayer they just called brother you
[17:50] know just something i collectively
[17:52] thought in my mind
[17:53] then one day i was sitting over there
[17:55] and he said brother joshua can you come
[17:56] up to leave the service i'm like okay he
[17:58] just called brother joshua to leave
[18:00] i thought about oh that's me and i kind
[18:02] of looked at him
[18:03] and i came up
[18:04] you know he was laughing at me too i
[18:06] remember
[18:07] and
[18:08] i remember that
[18:09] no but he was laughing at me and i'm
[18:11] like huh
[18:12] you know and i thank god for putting
[18:14] down his heart and i went and i sat down
[18:15] when i sat down i felt so guilty
[18:18] and the reason i was feeling so guilty
[18:20] was because a thought came to my mind
[18:23] and it was when i was just about
[18:24] probably godzilla and men's age we were
[18:26] sitting down over there standing over
[18:28] there and brother scott came up and he
[18:30] was leading song service it was the
[18:32] ending of the service and he said
[18:34] brother joshua he didn't call me brother
[18:35] he said joshua would you like to come
[18:37] and close the service
[18:40] i'm like nope
[18:43] i looked a minute i said no he's like
[18:45] what
[18:46] he was kind of confused he said what are
[18:48] you short i'm like yup
[18:50] it's like you sure i'm like yup i'm good
[18:53] he was like huh okay so he bowed his
[18:55] head and he closed he uh prayed close
[18:57] the service
[18:58] and i don't know why that just came to
[19:00] my mind out of nowhere and i'm like man
[19:02] i felt so bad that i said no to him
[19:05] and then i got home i told my my dad i
[19:08] told my mom you know they told me
[19:10] something but it was just really
[19:11] bothering me
[19:12] and it's kind of crazy that the things
[19:13] that bother you that you never really
[19:15] paid attention to
[19:17] but when they come back it kind of
[19:19] disturbs you a little bit
[19:21] and i remember i was sitting down it
[19:23] happened again they called me and
[19:25] the same feeling came to my mind and i
[19:28] just prayed about it i'm like you know
[19:29] what god could you
[19:31] ah
[19:32] i don't know why i'm feeling like this
[19:34] i'm very grateful that you put it on our
[19:35] brother's heart to call me but i just
[19:38] wish that brother scott could call on my
[19:40] name one one last time you know i know
[19:42] it probably won't happen because he
[19:43] doesn't leak song services no more but
[19:46] i just wish that he would call on my
[19:48] name
[19:50] and you know they called on me again
[19:52] and i just kind of forgot to pray that
[19:54] prayer i just kind of forgot about it
[19:56] and then one day brother scott came up
[19:58] to lee's song service
[20:00] the last song service that he led up
[20:01] here
[20:03] and he was
[20:04] leading song service and that thought
[20:05] didn't even cross my mind i was sitting
[20:07] over there and i did not think like
[20:09] called me i was i didn't think it at all
[20:12] you know
[20:14] and before he started he said brother
[20:16] joshua would you come up and leave song
[20:18] service i'm like okay i come up i lead
[20:21] it i go sit back down
[20:23] it didn't even hit me what just happened
[20:25] i just sat down and the thought was
[20:28] coming to my mind and as it was coming
[20:29] he actually was telling me something
[20:31] about brother loyal that happened
[20:33] you know giving his little testimony
[20:36] and i sat down
[20:38] and then we started singing we started
[20:39] singing and it hit me like oh my
[20:43] oh thank you jesus you know it just hit
[20:45] me out of nowhere i'm like thank you
[20:47] lord i just realized what just happened
[20:49] i was very slow too but once it caught
[20:51] me i just got the stomping harder got
[20:54] the clapping more you know it was like
[20:56] wow i didn't realize what just happened
[20:58] until it happened and like it just meant
[21:01] so much to me that that happened
[21:04] right before
[21:05] god took him on because it was
[21:07] you know it may sound small to some of
[21:09] you but it was a real burden to me
[21:11] because i felt like i really let
[21:14] my brother down in a sense
[21:16] and it was just always coming to my
[21:18] heart and i believe god knew
[21:20] what it meant to me to the point where
[21:23] before he took our brother home he
[21:26] had him do that because it would have
[21:27] definitely had been a burden on me for a
[21:28] while so i definitely appreciate the
[21:31] lord for that and i would also like to
[21:33] thank him today is my 21st birthday
[21:40] and i just
[21:41] i'm sorry i know it's past two minutes
[21:43] i'm sorry just give me one second i'm
[21:45] going
[21:45] all right but um
[21:47] this was the last place
[21:49] that i ever thought i was gonna be on my
[21:51] 21st birthday which is very sad to say
[21:54] but
[21:54] you know i thought
[21:56] like
[21:57] to be honest i thought i'd rather be in
[21:58] the grave
[22:00] or
[22:01] a lot of different places than be here
[22:03] today
[22:04] you know i don't see a lot of people
[22:05] i've been around a lot of people that
[22:07] are either dead
[22:09] in prison 16 25 years
[22:12] overdosed got killed and just it's just
[22:14] like
[22:16] i was just living the life that they was
[22:18] living so i thought my faith was gonna
[22:20] be the same as them but
[22:22] after being in so many different
[22:23] situations and
[22:25] getting out of certain situations that
[22:27] they would have got caught in
[22:29] and lost their life or lost their
[22:31] freedom
[22:33] something just told me like this
[22:34] probably ain't your cup of tea
[22:36] and you need to go find something
[22:37] different and
[22:39] i just thank the lord because my
[22:41] birthday has not fallen on sunday for
[22:44] like the past 11 years
[22:46] and it so happened to be that the 21st
[22:48] birthday which i would oh my cousin you
[22:50] we gonna go do this and we gonna go do
[22:51] that no sir i'm not doing none of that
[22:54] you know so it's
[22:56] it's it's a blessing so
[22:59] i like to give god the glory for that
[23:01] i'm sorry
[23:04] [Applause]
[23:19] shalom church
[23:23] i'm very nervous i don't know why i mean
[23:26] this is not the first time i'm
[23:28] in front of people speaking to people
[23:30] but for some reason
[23:32] i'm nervous
[23:35] um
[23:38] i knew brother scott you know for
[23:41] two and a half years now because i've
[23:42] been coming here
[23:44] since the end of 2018
[23:51] sometimes last year
[23:53] he told me he wanted to speak to me he
[23:55] wanted to meet with me
[23:57] and i didn't know you know was the
[23:58] meeting about
[24:00] and i was very nervous and anxious
[24:03] because at the time i just knew him for
[24:05] about a year
[24:08] and for some reason we couldn't find you
[24:10] know
[24:11] the right time
[24:12] and then finally
[24:14] we connect one saturday
[24:16] we met at caribou cafe in rabbit
[24:22] so during our meeting
[24:26] that's when he informed me what he
[24:28] wanted to meet me for
[24:33] he told me
[24:35] brother johnny
[24:37] me and sister naomi
[24:40] was wondering but i don't know how you
[24:41] will take it
[24:43] if the kids can start coming there you
[24:45] know on saturday
[24:47] as soon as you say that i start crying
[24:52] um so
[24:54] we can play with them we got a lot of
[24:55] games kids glam and stuff like that
[24:57] there's so many things we can do and
[24:59] that way you also can have time to
[25:01] yourself
[25:02] i say wow
[25:04] you don't even know me like that
[25:06] i asked him why
[25:09] and he said why not
[25:19] unbelievable
[25:21] and then
[25:22] i think we spend almost two hours we
[25:25] talk about a lot of things i talk about
[25:27] my conversion and you talk about other
[25:29] things but
[25:32] just to know that you know somebody can
[25:34] have that kind of love
[25:36] i mean this is children we're talking
[25:38] about
[25:39] they can bug you to death
[25:42] you know but
[25:43] because i have said i have twins one is
[25:46] a boy one is a girl so can you imagine
[25:49] but he's like you know i want them to
[25:51] start coming over on saturday
[25:56] that blew my mind i didn't expect that
[25:59] but that just to show you know what kind
[26:01] person or brother was
[26:02] but to go along with that you know i
[26:04] want to throw some flower
[26:06] at your sister because brother brown i'm
[26:08] saying it's better to throw flower at
[26:10] somebody one while they silly laughed
[26:12] then when did the dead
[26:15] sister naomi she's amazing
[26:18] i remember two days before the passing
[26:20] of her husband she texts me
[26:22] she wanted to know my email so i replied
[26:25] i sent her my email just to find out
[26:27] that she had a song
[26:29] she was preparing to sing with the
[26:30] children at church
[26:33] and this is the same lady during kovy
[26:36] she will come to the house and drop up
[26:38] some stuff
[26:39] for the children some materials so the
[26:41] the children can stay busy
[26:43] for them and sister i salute you i'm not
[26:45] gonna wait
[26:46] till god call you
[26:49] but here in closing you know
[26:53] i want all of us to know that death is
[26:54] an appointment we all have
[26:56] it's i mean it's an appointment we all
[26:58] have the appointment
[27:00] unless the rapture comes or jesus comes
[27:02] soon but
[27:04] here's my question to all of us
[27:06] how we want to be remembered
[27:08] when people are going to come and pay
[27:09] tribute what do they want what do you
[27:11] want them to say about you because now
[27:13] we still have time you know to change
[27:15] some things
[27:17] i can imagine
[27:18] cesar fei when people can go to her and
[27:20] tell her
[27:21] look to your father you let father have
[27:23] done for us and that's what i want now
[27:25] people to set my daughter
[27:28] to testify for the goodness of what i've
[27:30] done for people
[27:32] so now while we still have what we still
[27:34] have time we can change some things
[27:38] and that's the only way we can keep the
[27:40] memory of our brother
[27:42] because brother scott was all about love
[27:46] and i know some of us even when you come
[27:48] to church we don't greet one another
[27:50] i'm an usher sometimes i tell somebody
[27:52] to sit rather they resist they want to
[27:54] sit somewhere else
[27:57] it's hard
[27:58] how when do we gonna
[28:02] showing love to one another or sharing
[28:04] love because it's not just about this
[28:06] building me and brother scott did not
[28:08] meet europe we made that saddest church

[43:09] unto us
[43:11] to keep us
[43:15] to protect us
[43:17] to deliver us
[43:20] and there are angels that are assigned
[43:22] to us
[43:23] and i remember telling a story here once
[43:25] upon a time
[43:27] that
[43:28] back in ghana in the 80s
[43:31] there was a place there's a place called
[43:33] terma sherman one of the terrible areas
[43:36] there ever was in ghana
[43:38] and there was this little guy that would
[43:40] go to church
[43:41] close from church and she walked through
[43:43] the path a bush path to get to the town
[43:47] and she would be singing and praising
[43:49] god as she was going home
[43:51] unknown to her
[43:53] somebody had noticed it
[43:55] and wanted to take advantage of her
[43:57] and this man went and laid in the bush
[44:00] because she knew it was wednesday and
[44:03] this girl was coming to pass by she went
[44:05] to church close from church she was on
[44:08] her way home and she was just singing
[44:10] and praising god she didn't know there
[44:12] was danger in the way
[44:14] and as she got close to the man
[44:17] all the men saw
[44:19] two armed men
[44:21] one on the left one on the right and
[44:24] they were dressed in military uniform
[44:26] and they were escorting her and she was
[44:29] just singing and praising god
[44:32] praise be to god
[44:36] wherever you find yourself whatever
[44:38] condition you find yourself in
[44:40] know that you are not alone
[44:42] praise be to god

[1:01:18] us
[1:01:20] let us run with patients
[1:01:23] the race that is set before us
[1:01:26] looking unto jesus
[1:01:29] the offer and the finisher of our faith
[1:01:33] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:01:37] endure the cross
[1:01:40] despising the shame
[1:01:42] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[1:01:44] throne of god
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] lord once again we thank you for your
[1:01:51] word

[1:01:54] in jesus name
[1:01:56] amen

[1:02:25] and peter and said him and said lord
[1:02:30] if it without
[1:02:32] beat me come on today
[1:02:34] on the water
[1:02:37] and he said come
[1:02:41] and when
[1:02:43] peter was calm down after the ship
[1:02:46] he walked on the water to go to jesus
[1:02:52] but
[1:02:53] when he saw the wind busted us
[1:02:56] he was afraid
[1:02:58] and beginning to sink
[1:03:00] he cried saying
[1:03:02] lord save me
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:07] we thank god for his word amen
[1:03:09] god's word you know it's just wonderful
[1:03:14] and the bible tells us heaven and earth
[1:03:16] will pass away
[1:03:18] by the word of the lord we never pass
[1:03:21] away
[1:03:23] let's maybe we read one more scripture
[1:03:25] from the book of second kings
[1:03:27] second
[1:03:28] kings chapter two
[1:03:37] second kings chapter two
[1:03:39] let's straight from verse nine
[1:03:41] and it came to pass when they were gone
[1:03:44] over that elijah said unto elisha
[1:03:48] ask
[1:03:49] what i shall do for thee
[1:03:53] before i be taken away from thee
[1:03:58] and elijah said
[1:03:59] i pray
[1:04:01] let a double portion of thy spirit be
[1:04:04] upon me
[1:04:07] and he said
[1:04:09] thou
[1:04:11] as asked
[1:04:13] a hard thing
[1:04:16] nevertheless
[1:04:18] if thou see me
[1:04:22] when i'm taken
[1:04:24] away from thee
[1:04:28] it shall be so unto thee
[1:04:32] but if not
[1:04:34] it shall not be so
[1:04:37] and it came to pass as they still went
[1:04:39] on and talk
[1:04:43] that behold there appeared a child of
[1:04:46] fire and horses of fire
[1:04:49] and parted them both asunder
[1:04:52] and elijah went up
[1:04:55] by a wide wind into heaven
[1:04:59] and elijah saw it
[1:05:02] and he cried
[1:05:03] my father my father
[1:05:05] the child of israel and the us men
[1:05:08] thereof
[1:05:10] and he saw him no more
[1:05:13] and he took hold of his old man or
[1:05:16] clothes
[1:05:17] and ran them into
[1:05:19] he took up also the mantle of elijah
[1:05:23] that fell from him
[1:05:25] and went back and stood by the bank of
[1:05:28] jordan
[1:05:30] and it took the mantle of elijah that
[1:05:33] fell from him
[1:05:34] and smote the waters
[1:05:36] and say where is the lord god of elijah
[1:05:39] and when he had also had smite in the
[1:05:42] waters departed heather and heather and
[1:05:45] the elisha went over
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] so we can just continue to read the
[1:05:51] scriptures and read the scriptures and
[1:05:53] read the scriptures and it's just
[1:05:55] wonderful because that's the only way we
[1:05:57] grow as christians is we read our bible
[1:06:00] every day
[1:06:01] and you pray every day amen so
[1:06:04] cultivate the habit to read the bible
[1:06:08] some of us don't read the bible
[1:06:11] but
[1:06:12] only you come to church and then you but
[1:06:14] read it at home
[1:06:16] find time to read your bible
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:21] now we have living in a great technology
[1:06:24] i mean technology age and you know
[1:06:27] scientific advancement so you can get
[1:06:29] your bibles you don't want to carry
[1:06:31] bible but you can get your bible on your
[1:06:33] phones
[1:06:34] praise the lord so what will be your
[1:06:37] excuse if you don't read it
[1:06:40] so you can read it anyway
[1:06:43] so please
[1:06:44] read the bibles
[1:06:46] read it everywhere
[1:06:49] use your type wisely
[1:06:52] because we have been admonished
[1:06:55] to meditate on god's word day and night
[1:07:00] so young people
[1:07:02] enough of music
[1:07:05] enough for programs and games
[1:07:07] right
[1:07:08] enough of whatsapp and facebook
[1:07:11] and a different one messenger instagram
[1:07:16] this this this
[1:07:18] and all these things steal our time from
[1:07:21] us
[1:07:24] may god give us grace to be wise
[1:07:28] because you are not going to be
[1:07:29] questioning and what do you see on the
[1:07:32] instagram or whatever easter or munday
[1:07:35] or whatever gram or whatever but what
[1:07:37] did you do with god's word
[1:07:40] we must use our time wisely because we
[1:07:42] have been told to redeem the time
[1:07:46] and the enemy too has brought in a lot
[1:07:48] of things to steal our time
[1:07:51] i'm telling you the time we spend on
[1:07:53] these phones is match
[1:07:56] from this program to this other one and
[1:07:58] the things that you know just keep
[1:08:00] appealing to us
[1:08:02] anyway
[1:08:05] this morning
[1:08:06] we want to speak on keep your eyes on
[1:08:09] jesus
[1:08:13] keep looking to jesus
[1:08:18] do you know that there is something
[1:08:19] about what we look at
[1:08:24] what you look at there is something
[1:08:25] about it
[1:08:27] because the eye
[1:08:30] is a gateway it's an athlete that goes
[1:08:32] right to your soul
[1:08:36] so there is something about what you
[1:08:39] look at
[1:08:41] and you can see why
[1:08:43] there is so much of adverts
[1:08:46] and everything is about what you look
[1:08:49] like sometimes even you have not planned
[1:08:51] to eat but you look at an advert and you
[1:08:54] see some burger and some this and some
[1:08:56] this
[1:08:57] and some ice cream and the way they made
[1:08:59] it
[1:09:01] you want to eat ice cream
[1:09:03] you you want some beggar
[1:09:06] they draw they make it so nice
[1:09:09] and once you look at it it draws you
[1:09:14] and sometimes you want to lick the air
[1:09:16] swatch
[1:09:17] i can't wait to get there
[1:09:21] what you look at
[1:09:24] is very important
[1:09:27] so
[1:09:29] we must be careful of what we look at
[1:09:35] and
[1:09:37] remember in the scripture in the
[1:09:39] beginning
[1:09:41] it was what eve looked at
[1:09:45] that brought us into the state in which
[1:09:47] we are today
[1:09:50] she looked at the three
[1:09:53] and he saw a tree to be desired to make
[1:09:56] one wise
[1:09:58] and she stopped
[1:10:01] that is why she made a mistake
[1:10:05] she stopped
[1:10:08] because of what she looked at
[1:10:14] praise the lord
[1:10:18] what you look at
[1:10:19] affects your life
[1:10:23] so you can be affected
[1:10:25] positively
[1:10:27] or negatively depending on what you look
[1:10:30] at
[1:10:31] because what you're looking at you are
[1:10:34] feeding on it
[1:10:37] that's what the prophet of god said
[1:10:40] let me come to your office or the house
[1:10:42] or whatever let me see what you looking
[1:10:44] at
[1:10:46] it's i know what you are feeding on
[1:10:54] but what am i saying this morning
[1:10:56] let's keep our eyes on the lord jesus
[1:10:59] christ
[1:11:01] because there's so many things happening
[1:11:02] today try to distract our attention
[1:11:07] from the main thing
[1:11:10] the prophet of god said
[1:11:13] so there are so many voices in the world
[1:11:15] today
[1:11:17] so many problems
[1:11:19] and so many needs
[1:11:22] crying for attention
[1:11:25] but there will never be a voice
[1:11:29] so important
[1:11:32] and
[1:11:33] that was so attending to
[1:11:37] as the voice of the spirit of god
[1:11:41] and that's what the scripture says
[1:11:43] he that have an ear
[1:11:46] let him hear
[1:11:48] what the spirit is saying
[1:11:52] and the spirit speaks through the
[1:11:54] prophet
[1:11:55] for in every age
[1:11:58] god's mind is meant no
[1:12:01] to his messenger
[1:12:04] that's why god addresses himself every
[1:12:07] time as we go through the church and he
[1:12:09] said unto the angel of the church right
[1:12:14] so god addresses himself to the
[1:12:17] messenger of the age
[1:12:21] unto the angel of the church right so
[1:12:23] whatever god has to an aid but it passes
[1:12:27] through the messenger
[1:12:31] so if you tell me the prophet william
[1:12:32] brown is not the messenger of the egg
[1:12:34] who is the messenger of the age are you
[1:12:37] the messenger
[1:12:42] martin luther was a messenger
[1:12:45] who is the messenger of this age
[1:12:57] it might not
[1:12:59] qualify to you
[1:13:01] he might not be in your sight
[1:13:04] but that is god's choice
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:10] praise the lord
[1:13:12] that's god's choice
[1:13:16] you try to find thoughts with the
[1:13:18] prophet and find forth
[1:13:20] then you cannot even believe the bible
[1:13:23] because all the men that we read about
[1:13:25] were men with thoughts
[1:13:29] why would you talk about abraham
[1:13:31] the friend of god
[1:13:33] because of fear that man told his wife
[1:13:35] tell the people that i am not your
[1:13:37] husband
[1:13:40] he lied yes right
[1:13:42] i'm just talking the bible
[1:13:45] god told him don't leave you alone he
[1:13:47] left
[1:13:51] what about the man after god's own heart
[1:13:54] david
[1:13:57] he commented that don't drink any kills
[1:14:01] go through the scriptures
[1:14:07] you know
[1:14:08] even if you go to israel to the
[1:14:11] palestine to ask about jesus you hear a
[1:14:13] lot of things right right
[1:14:17] once i was in god in israel i went we
[1:14:20] were on the golan height
[1:14:21] and then we met a jewish rabbi and
[1:14:24] the brothers tried to ask so what do you
[1:14:27] think about jesus he said no i don't
[1:14:28] want to speak anything let's remain
[1:14:30] friends listen no but just let us know
[1:14:33] what you think
[1:14:34] you know what a rabbi told us i pity you
[1:14:36] people follow
[1:14:40] jesus so if they didn't want to speak by
[1:14:43] the bro you just he said i pray to you
[1:14:45] people
[1:14:46] follow jesus he said no
[1:14:49] and i look i said oh the blindness
[1:14:51] blindness still happening to these
[1:14:53] people
[1:14:56] so
[1:14:57] he depends
[1:14:59] where you are taking your information
[1:15:01] from
[1:15:04] come on it depends on where you are
[1:15:05] taking your affirmation from
[1:15:08] you read the scriptures you read about
[1:15:11] the disciples you go and ask the people
[1:15:14] that were in those days
[1:15:18] read about the prophets the people we
[1:15:21] admire prophet isaiah prophet jeremiah
[1:15:24] prophet this and that do you know that
[1:15:26] they were all killed
[1:15:29] the bible said isaiah was so asunder
[1:15:32] you know how many things jeremiah
[1:15:34] suffered in his days the whipping
[1:15:36] prophet
[1:15:38] why did that kill the prophet because
[1:15:40] jesus came and he told them your fathers
[1:15:43] killed the prophet
[1:15:45] and you garnished their tombs why did
[1:15:47] they kill the prophet because they
[1:15:49] thought the prophets were wrong
[1:15:51] that's right
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:54] because the prophet was not speaking
[1:15:57] what they wanted to hear
[1:16:00] and that's why the prophets were wrong
[1:16:04] and jesus speaking in his day said be
[1:16:06] happy and rejoice
[1:16:08] if they persecute you
[1:16:10] if this become man of emotions against
[1:16:12] you
[1:16:13] he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:16:16] for so persecuted day of the prophets of
[1:16:19] god
[1:16:21] so the prophets of god were always
[1:16:23] persecuted and the people of god today
[1:16:27] will be persecuted
[1:16:28] for those that will live godly in christ
[1:16:31] jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:16:35] praise the lord
[1:16:37] are we together
[1:16:39] do you know in the scripture even when
[1:16:41] jesus said except you eat my flesh
[1:16:44] and drink my blood you had no part in me
[1:16:48] do you know that
[1:16:49] what jesus was saying to them why did
[1:16:52] the people left him
[1:16:54] servant of his own disciples
[1:16:56] moses has told the people don't eat
[1:16:58] blood
[1:17:00] let alone this man telling us except we
[1:17:03] eat his
[1:17:04] flesh
[1:17:05] and drink his blood how can we eat a
[1:17:07] man's voice
[1:17:08] did you hear what the man said
[1:17:12] and they might be whispering did you
[1:17:14] hear what he said today
[1:17:19] he said we eat this flesh
[1:17:21] how can we eat a man's flesh
[1:17:24] it was exactly against what moses said
[1:17:28] it was contrary to what moses said
[1:17:32] and they tried to put their own
[1:17:34] understanding
[1:17:37] they tried to understand it
[1:17:39] they were trying to explain it
[1:17:41] but we are not as to explain let us
[1:17:44] understand we are asked to believe
[1:17:48] that is why
[1:17:50] when they left here
[1:17:52] jesus said to the rest will he also god
[1:17:55] amen
[1:18:00] shall we go
[1:18:02] for we know you are the christ
[1:18:05] we might not understand what you are
[1:18:06] saying but you are the
[1:18:09] christ amen
[1:18:12] hallelujah
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:15] they did not walk nobody with him
[1:18:18] they left the message
[1:18:20] they left the church
[1:18:24] why because of that statement
[1:18:27] and you look at this physically but
[1:18:29] moses said this is not right
[1:18:31] moshe said we shouldn't eat blood is
[1:18:33] that when you even kill an animal let
[1:18:35] the blood go
[1:18:37] don't eat it how can this man say that
[1:18:40] ah this man has gone into error
[1:18:43] they must say that yeah the man is not a
[1:18:44] theologian he's just a healer he was
[1:18:46] another now he begin to teach
[1:18:49] and that's what he said about a prophet
[1:18:51] he was not a you know it's not that your
[1:18:53] logic was not a theologian he the gift
[1:18:55] was different healing and then he now
[1:18:57] begin to take upon himself to teach
[1:19:03] if god we are not a man and choosing the
[1:19:06] way you the prophet in a day more than
[1:19:09] any other prophet
[1:19:10] ministry since apostolic day
[1:19:14] and revealed the secrets of the heart
[1:19:17] will god leave that man in error
[1:19:19] brother branham said do you think god
[1:19:21] will give me the ministry he has given
[1:19:23] me and vindicate it all over the world
[1:19:25] and leave me in error it's certainly not
[1:19:28] i know where i am standing
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:34] hallelujah
[1:19:36] keep your eyes on jesus
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:42] amen you must know where to find your
[1:19:44] answer
[1:19:45] get to the scripture you'll find the
[1:19:47] answer
[1:19:48] but if you ask for man and some woman
[1:19:50] they will tell you your opinions what
[1:19:53] they think
[1:19:55] yes
[1:20:00] there are many things you cannot explain
[1:20:05] supernatural things you cannot explain
[1:20:07] it always praise the lord
[1:20:12] hallelujah
[1:20:14] may god help us
[1:20:16] keep your eyes on jesus
[1:20:19] keep your eyes on jesus in the beginning
[1:20:22] watch the word the word was with god and
[1:20:25] the word was god and the word was made
[1:20:27] flesh
[1:20:28] and direct hamonas
[1:20:30] don't get yourself confused
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:35] if because you stop to look
[1:20:41] to listen
[1:20:42] to mr serpent
[1:20:47] because she stopped to listen she want
[1:20:49] to know reason she raised it she was she
[1:20:52] risen against the world because yeah
[1:20:55] there are so many things that if you
[1:20:56] want to reason hey you'll be off
[1:20:59] you see oh yeah there's something proof
[1:21:01] about this thing but brother like i've
[1:21:04] told people
[1:21:05] i am not looking for the truth i have
[1:21:07] found the truth
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:10] let there be struggles
[1:21:13] like when they went and called nathaniel
[1:21:15] philip went and cornered he said come we
[1:21:17] have found him
[1:21:19] the one that moses spoke about
[1:21:22] he said we have found him
[1:21:24] the one that moses spoke about on the
[1:21:26] other side that the pharisees were
[1:21:28] saying this is a devil
[1:21:30] but philip said we found him.
[1:21:34] so it depends on what you are looking at
[1:21:38] where you are why are you looking for
[1:21:39] your answer look to the scriptures
[1:21:42] so in the bible in isaiah 45 22 god said
[1:21:46] look unto me
[1:21:49] are ye ends of the earth look unto me
[1:21:51] for salvation
[1:21:53] look unto me for healing
[1:21:55] look unto me for the answer look unto me
[1:21:58] for deliverance look unto me because i
[1:22:00] am the way the truth and the life look
[1:22:03] unto me the unchangeable god look unto
[1:22:06] me you are mighty look unto me the alpha
[1:22:09] and the omega look unto me the author
[1:22:12] and the finish of your faith look unto
[1:22:15] me
[1:22:16] for healing look unto me for deliverance
[1:22:19] look unto me for the baptism of the holy
[1:22:22] ghost look unto me for the changing of
[1:22:24] your life
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:32] you won't finance that continuous
[1:22:33] criticism
[1:22:34] if you got on the internet today you'll
[1:22:37] find so many things
[1:22:38] even today against our lord jesus christ
[1:22:42] you know that
[1:22:44] go to the internet
[1:22:46] somebody they stand don't believe jesus
[1:22:47] is not god
[1:22:49] jesus is if you say all kinds of
[1:22:51] blasphemy things against our lord
[1:22:55] all kinds of oh my goodness
[1:23:01] may god help us
[1:23:03] so it depends on what you are looking at
[1:23:05] what you are ready
[1:23:06] and the source
[1:23:10] that's why you must come to the word
[1:23:12] you need the revelation of the word of
[1:23:14] the lord
[1:23:16] god has to reveal himself to a man if
[1:23:20] god doesn't reveal himself you will
[1:23:21] never know him
[1:23:23] because god hides in self and simplicity
[1:23:27] in simplicity and reveals himself in
[1:23:30] simplicity
[1:23:32] that's why he said no you're calling not
[1:23:34] many wise men not many nobles not many
[1:23:37] professors not many of these and that
[1:23:39] and that but god has chosen the best
[1:23:42] things of this life to confront the
[1:23:44] mighty
[1:23:48] for the wisdom of this world is foolish
[1:23:50] to god
[1:23:51] yes sir
[1:23:55] look unto me look unto jesus
[1:23:59] hallelujah
[1:24:00] hallelujah
[1:24:03] read the scriptures brothers and sisters
[1:24:06] they killed the prophets
[1:24:08] they contained the prophets
[1:24:13] jeremiah they call him a false prophet
[1:24:17] isaiah a false prophet
[1:24:20] every one of them that's why they kill
[1:24:22] them
[1:24:24] right
[1:24:25] they hear the false prophets and they
[1:24:27] condemn the true prophets the true
[1:24:30] prophets of god were condemned how can
[1:24:32] today people be finding things against
[1:24:34] the message of the hour against the
[1:24:36] prophet and the catholic church is there
[1:24:39] and you don't find this against the
[1:24:40] catholic church
[1:24:41] you don't find this again a matter of
[1:24:43] the church you don't find this against
[1:24:44] all these things around us but you want
[1:24:46] to find something against william
[1:24:48] branham
[1:24:49] against the message of the hour against
[1:24:51] the message that has transformed the
[1:24:53] lives of millions
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:25:00] if it has not done that for you it has
[1:25:02] done that for me

[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:10] i was reading the bible

[1:25:23] buying christian books and and it time i
[1:25:25] you know i i was i got a small job
[1:25:27] during 98 1975 and then i just going
[1:25:30] back christian literature and then read
[1:25:32] about missionaries and read about this
[1:25:34] and read about that and i just preaching
[1:25:36] on about trinity about this and that on
[1:25:39] that until i got the message in 1978 and
[1:25:42] then i didn't even buy somebody gave me
[1:25:44] a book
[1:25:47] and
[1:25:48] one of the first books i read was a true
[1:25:50] sign that is overlooked
[1:25:54] and i was getting ready to go to bible
[1:25:55] college
[1:25:58] because i was in the presbyterian church
[1:26:00] and in the time he said look
[1:26:02] there are no many people that the thing
[1:26:04] is in you so go to bible college
[1:26:07] got to trinity
[1:26:09] i was very active in the church and
[1:26:11] yeah yeah yeah i was very active and
[1:26:15] and then we became in we were in a
[1:26:17] little prayer group and we call it
[1:26:19] prayer and outreach group and we pray
[1:26:21] and we go out and preach we go to dumb
[1:26:23] broadcasting maybe about 4 4 35 we are
[1:26:26] out in the in the morning preaching
[1:26:29] preaching in the neighborhood preaching
[1:26:30] here and there in the morning sometimes
[1:26:32] we take the bus season we paid and go up
[1:26:34] and down the city pray and preach and
[1:26:37] preach and preach and then even in time
[1:26:39] we go to when people are going to cinema
[1:26:41] and
[1:26:42] make a line to go and watch the film and
[1:26:44] we'll be there preaching
[1:26:46] preaching in the morning when we are
[1:26:48] going to work we meet them at the
[1:26:50] station the lorry park because they have

[1:27:13] any preacher like this
[1:27:15] wow
[1:27:17] i don't want to overlook that sign
[1:27:20] the true sign
[1:27:22] i don't want to overlook it
[1:27:24] because if you are driving and you miss
[1:27:26] the sign you fail to get the right
[1:27:29] interpretation of the wrong side you'll
[1:27:32] kill yourself
[1:27:34] you will miss the junction
[1:27:36] you'll miss the exit and you'll find
[1:27:38] yourself somewhere else
[1:27:40] and many people have missed the exits
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:45] you must know how to interpret at all
[1:27:46] science
[1:27:48] that's a story i had somebody went to
[1:27:50] and they tried to find about the road
[1:27:51] science
[1:27:52] and he saw a place and they dropped
[1:27:55] they've dropped
[1:27:57] they have drilled cattle
[1:27:59] and they say what is this it's a chokbar
[1:28:01] that is restaurant
[1:28:05] because you saw the cattle draw and they
[1:28:07] said what does he say it's a
[1:28:12] restaurant he don't know his cattle
[1:28:14] crossing but when he saw cat he taught
[1:28:17] his food he says restaurant
[1:28:21] you must put the right interpretation to
[1:28:23] the wrong size
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:34] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:28:36] ethnic bride
[1:28:37] i didn't even understood it but
[1:28:40] something emissions
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:45] and the grace of god has brought me this
[1:28:47] far
[1:28:48] no turning back
[1:28:51] i have decided i have made up my mind i
[1:28:54] am convinced and i'm going forward
[1:28:58] because i see my life what this thing
[1:29:01] has done
[1:29:02] what the word of god is doing in my life
[1:29:05] i am break up my mind
[1:29:07] and i keep looking to jesus
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:14] for the bible said
[1:29:15] looking unto jesus
[1:29:17] the offer
[1:29:18] and the finisher of our faith the
[1:29:21] beginning
[1:29:23] and the end of our faith
[1:29:25] the offer and the omega of our faith
[1:29:28] the word the truth and the lies
[1:29:31] keep your eyes on the lord jesus christ
[1:29:35] the word of the lord made flesh for in
[1:29:38] every age god's word becomes flesh yes
[1:29:40] [Music]

[1:29:45] hallelujah glory
[1:29:47] may god help us
[1:29:49] amen
[1:29:52] if you're a double-minded person
[1:29:54] may god help you
[1:29:56] strengthen you up because you are
[1:29:58] confusing yourself
[1:30:00] you are confusing yourself you want to
[1:30:02] read about this what prophet saw this
[1:30:04] said what prophet has that said what
[1:30:07] scientists they say or what i don't care
[1:30:10] what anybody says
[1:30:14] i said i don't care what anybody says
[1:30:17] i only cares but what god says
[1:30:20] what the word says
[1:30:22] what did the one says i will send you a
[1:30:24] light of the prophet
[1:30:26] before the coming of the tragedy of the
[1:30:28] lord and it will turn the heart of the
[1:30:30] children to the faith of the fathers
[1:30:32] that's what i'm concerned about
[1:30:39] as it was in the death of noah so shall
[1:30:40] it be in the days of the son of man
[1:30:43] one time
[1:30:46] around 1778 when i got a message and
[1:30:49] after that we there was a crusade and
[1:30:51] you know from pedicles that people have
[1:30:53] in the crusade at rich meeting and i
[1:30:56] went there and i was standing there and
[1:30:58] you know we like the things of god so
[1:31:01] just was there and then after
[1:31:05] the preaching was over somebody came to
[1:31:07] me they tried to convince people talk to
[1:31:09] people to give their lives to christ
[1:31:12] it's very important if you're here you
[1:31:14] might be coming to church if you have
[1:31:16] never given your life to christ
[1:31:18] please do it
[1:31:20] surrender your life to christ
[1:31:22] it's not enough to oh the message is
[1:31:24] true the preaching is nice receive it
[1:31:30] you have to repent repent
[1:31:32] the bible say repent and be baptized
[1:31:35] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[1:31:38] the remission of your sins
[1:31:42] amen oh but the bible says repent of me
[1:31:44] baptize in the name in the name of the
[1:31:45] father and of the son and of the lord
[1:31:47] yes sir
[1:31:48] the name of the father son holy ghost is
[1:31:50] the lord jesus christ
[1:31:52] like our western people if you are in
[1:31:54] the class and the teacher said grace or
[1:31:56] whoever you are come and write your name
[1:31:58] on the blackboard
[1:32:00] write your name on the blackboard you
[1:32:01] come to the blackboard and you say write
[1:32:03] your name on the blackboard
[1:32:05] but teach yourself i should write my
[1:32:07] name on it so i i'm just doing what
[1:32:09] teachers say write your name on the
[1:32:11] black board
[1:32:16] write your name on the right yes the
[1:32:17] teacher says so write your name a little
[1:32:19] bit
[1:32:21] and jesus said baptize and baptize them
[1:32:23] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:32:25] and of the holy ghost that's what we do
[1:32:27] in the name of the father we baptize you
[1:32:29] in the name of the father in the name of
[1:32:31] the son
[1:32:32] what is the name
[1:32:34] what is your name
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:38] jesus said father yes i have revealed
[1:32:40] your name unto them
[1:32:43] jesus said i did not come in my father i
[1:32:45] didn't come in my own name i came in my
[1:32:47] father's name
[1:32:48] if he came in his father's name and he's
[1:32:51] called jesus that is the father's name
[1:32:58] he said i came in my father's name
[1:33:01] what is the father's name it's jesus
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:09] that's why the bible says whatsoever we
[1:33:11] do whether we eat whether we bury
[1:33:14] whether we baptize whatever we do we
[1:33:16] should do it all
[1:33:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:33:21] for there is no name under heaven
[1:33:24] given among men whereby we must be saved
[1:33:27] except the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:33:31] so
[1:33:32] if you are here
[1:33:34] and you have not been baptized in the
[1:33:36] name of the lord jesus christ to be
[1:33:38] identified with fame in his death bloody
[1:33:41] and resurrection
[1:33:42] i admonish you this morning
[1:33:45] i admonish you this morning
[1:33:48] repent
[1:33:50] surrender your life
[1:33:52] and be identified with him
[1:33:54] in his death
[1:33:56] in his barrier
[1:33:57] in his resurrection
[1:34:01] hallelujah young woman mama papa you
[1:34:04] don't need to be a sympathizer god is
[1:34:06] not looking for sympathizers
[1:34:09] god is looking for his sons and
[1:34:10] daughters god is looking for people that
[1:34:13] will take their stand
[1:34:15] people that will identify with jesus
[1:34:18] people that will pledge allegiance to
[1:34:20] the lamb of god people that will say yes
[1:34:22] lord i believe
[1:34:24] yes lord i believe
[1:34:26] yes i surrender to you i will go with
[1:34:28] you other way
[1:34:30] if you have never done that please don't
[1:34:32] go back the same
[1:34:35] because time is running out
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:44] hallelujah may the lord help us
[1:34:47] are we together
[1:34:49] oh i'm feeling so good
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:52] i'm feeling so good
[1:34:54] talking about jesus
[1:34:56] accepting jesus
[1:34:58] and i want to remind you in our age
[1:35:00] nobody exhausted jesus christ like
[1:35:02] william branham
[1:35:05] when people were holding on to trinity
[1:35:07] and trinity and this man stood up and he
[1:35:10] prayed to us that jesus is the
[1:35:12] christ right
[1:35:14] jesus is the lord
[1:35:16] jesus is a healer
[1:35:18] jesus is the baptizer
[1:35:20] jesus is everything yes yes
[1:35:24] yes
[1:35:24] he is such a christ
[1:35:27] he preached christ
[1:35:29] and if you receive the message you
[1:35:32] receive christ
[1:35:33] as your lord and savior
[1:35:35] you line up your life
[1:35:37] with the word
[1:35:40] amen if we say we are believers
[1:35:42] and we believe this message
[1:35:46] your life will line up with these
[1:35:47] creatures
[1:35:48] because that is what the prophet
[1:35:50] preached
[1:35:53] one time i listened to the testimony of
[1:35:54] brother agreement he said a man was
[1:35:56] annoyed with him and the man said to

[1:36:01] about your people is your your pastor
[1:36:04] is mistaken to be jesus christ
[1:36:09] but apparently he said to the brother
[1:36:10] the man he didn't believe the message
[1:36:13] but prairie green said to him excuse me
[1:36:15] sir has anybody ever mistaken your
[1:36:17] pastor to be jesus christ it's no longer
[1:36:21] no no no no
[1:36:22] brother praise i'm glad i'm happy
[1:36:26] that my pastor has been mistaken to be
[1:36:28] jesus christ do you think it's easy for
[1:36:30] somebody to be mistaken to be jesus
[1:36:31] christ
[1:36:34] he said that's the difference your
[1:36:36] pastor is not living the life
[1:36:39] my pastor is living their life
[1:36:41] [Music]

[1:39:06] say you are
[1:39:07] the people we are successful who knew
[1:39:09] sir we are
[1:39:11] the people that see us up in the home
[1:39:13] today say you are
[1:39:15] amen
[1:39:18] god help us
[1:39:21] are we together
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:25] why do they mention jeremiah
[1:39:27] why did they mention isaiah
[1:39:29] these were godly people
[1:39:31] you know what every prophet that came
[1:39:33] lived part of the life of christ
[1:39:36] because you were the god of the prophets
[1:39:39] he was the word he was the fullness of
[1:39:41] the word
[1:39:42] the fullness of god in christ yes so
[1:39:45] every prophet lived part of their life
[1:39:47] so some people look i said ah does not
[1:39:49] behave like whatever
[1:39:51] ah it was a gripping prophet like
[1:39:53] jeremiah was
[1:39:54] oh he was a prophet like moses the
[1:39:57] lawgiver
[1:39:58] he speaks with authority and somebody oh
[1:40:00] it looks like this one oh it looks like
[1:40:03] that one
[1:40:08] who do you say do they say you are
[1:40:13] whatever in your place and your phrase
[1:40:15] who do they say what do they say about
[1:40:17] you

[1:40:22] may god help us
[1:40:25] what is your own testimony
[1:40:28] whom do they say you are
[1:40:33] not just your dressing
[1:40:44] because the tree is known by the fruit
[1:40:47] at best
[1:40:52] not what you say about yourself whom do
[1:40:54] they say you are
[1:40:56] the people that relate with you

[1:41:12] reproach upon the cross of christ
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:22] your men
[1:41:24] your women
[1:41:25] mothers and fathers
[1:41:27] may god help us
[1:41:29] hallelujah
[1:41:31] i hope you are not getting annoyed at me
[1:41:34] but if you do that's your own choice i
[1:41:36] don't care about that
[1:41:39] i didn't come here so that you'll be
[1:41:41] praising me or i will be robbing you
[1:41:43] with some vaseline or something you know
[1:41:46] i didn't come here for that
[1:41:51] i'm here
[1:41:53] yet my memories to god that he will make
[1:41:55] use of me
[1:41:57] that you and i will be helped
[1:42:00] that way this life is over we'll meet on

[1:42:11] that somebody straighten up and somebody
[1:42:14] line up and somebody received the holy
[1:42:16] ghost and somebody's faith is alleged to
[1:42:19] be more like jesus
[1:42:26] hallelujah
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:29] god help us
[1:42:30] so as i was saying as i was standing at
[1:42:33] that crusade
[1:42:34] and somebody came to me
[1:42:36] he said brother you know he talked to me
[1:42:39] and
[1:42:39] you know the bible says
[1:42:41] as it was in the days of noah and uh
[1:42:44] people were eating and they were
[1:42:45] drinking i said and so what
[1:42:49] so i made myself as i don't know
[1:42:50] anything about bible and he said they
[1:42:52] were eating i said so what happened and
[1:42:54] then this and that and then it continued
[1:42:56] i said so what happened and the women
[1:42:57] were like this and they were modern i
[1:42:59] said so what and it he said and then he
[1:43:01] said you know and god sent a prophet and
[1:43:04] noah was preaching to them and told them
[1:43:06] to come into the act that's okay
[1:43:08] when he said we came to the asset now
[1:43:10] sir
[1:43:11] will you agree with me that we need a
[1:43:14] prophet like noah
[1:43:16] you look up he said you're a brahmin say
[1:43:18] look at you
[1:43:22] you thought they were eating they were
[1:43:24] drinking they were doing this and they
[1:43:26] were doing this and all these things we
[1:43:28] see it
[1:43:29] i said they will not greed that we will
[1:43:31] need a prophet like noah because jesus
[1:43:34] said i said to us so celebrity
[1:43:38] why is that prophet like noah
[1:43:40] who is that prophet like noah
[1:43:42] if you said he's not willing are you the
[1:43:44] one yeah
[1:43:47] this prophet was vindicated by jehovah
[1:43:49] god
[1:43:50] with sights and wonders
[1:43:52] in the life of brother branham this
[1:43:54] creature was made real
[1:43:56] jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:43:58] [Music]
[1:44:01] in the man's life
[1:44:03] this creature that jesus or whatever
[1:44:06] it's it's reason because
[1:44:08] when he came
[1:44:10] he went to the jews
[1:44:11] he said don't go to the gentiles
[1:44:14] he did this revealing of the son of man
[1:44:16] to the jews and the samaritans
[1:44:20] three races of people
[1:44:23] jews gentiles samaritans the jews had it
[1:44:26] the samaritan's added the gentiles
[1:44:28] didn't have it yes
[1:44:30] but he said
[1:44:32] that would be the revealing of the son
[1:44:34] of man
[1:44:36] and in our age the son of man was
[1:44:38] revealed
[1:44:39] brother branham was not the son of man
[1:44:42] he was a son of a man revealing the
[1:44:46] sound of man
[1:44:47] the son of man is the lord jesus christ
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:52] but his body was borrowed
[1:44:55] god borrowed that members
[1:44:57] and god borrows your members
[1:45:00] god always brought roots
[1:45:03] he borrowed the womb
[1:45:06] he borrowed the boot
[1:45:08] he borrowed the body
[1:45:10] moses
[1:45:12] he borrowed please borrow me
[1:45:14] please give me who will borrow him this
[1:45:16] morning
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:18] who will borrow him this morning
[1:45:21] murray he borrow the womb
[1:45:24] who will borrow you something so that he
[1:45:26] can use you
[1:45:27] he can barely set he can hide himself
[1:45:31] and reveal himself through you
[1:45:34] he needs young men today he needs young
[1:45:36] women today he needs sons and daughters
[1:45:39] today he needs vessels today he need
[1:45:41] people that will surround surrender say
[1:45:43] lord take me
[1:45:45] lord take me
[1:45:47] lord take me i surrender to you
[1:45:50] because no matter your age irrespective
[1:45:52] of your age
[1:45:54] if you surrender to him
[1:45:56] he will use you
[1:46:01] lord help me
[1:46:03] hallelujah
[1:46:04] i believe he's using me
[1:46:08] and i believe it's using you
[1:46:11] because man is god's agent
[1:46:15] he uses us
[1:46:16] to express himself
[1:46:19] to make himself known yes
[1:46:21] he uses us
[1:46:23] he uses our eyes
[1:46:25] our ears
[1:46:26] he uses our members
[1:46:28] but lebron said he has no legs but your
[1:46:30] legs
[1:46:32] he has no hands but your hands
[1:46:34] he has no eyes but your eyes
[1:46:36] so if you borrow him he will see visions
[1:46:39] he will see dreams he will preach
[1:46:41] through us he will give prophecy
[1:46:44] he will manifest himself he will live
[1:46:47] his own life
[1:46:48] and when people see you oh
[1:47:05] we testify brother scout
[1:47:11] god needs best to use
[1:47:14] god needs them do you know
[1:47:16] when you look at something
[1:47:18] you become one with it
[1:47:20] something happens
[1:47:22] that's true
[1:47:24] let me give in the scripture i think
[1:47:26] genesis 30 or somewhere there
[1:47:29] jacob
[1:47:32] with his father-in-law leban
[1:47:35] and lebanon was praying tricks this
[1:47:37] couple had to wait for the man the man
[1:47:38] was not ready to pay him
[1:47:40] to give him the good corrupt pay
[1:47:43] hey
[1:47:44] don't try to cheat anybody
[1:47:47] no it's not good
[1:47:48] our
[1:47:51] yes
[1:47:52] we should be honest and sincere don't be
[1:47:55] tricky
[1:47:56] and don't try to act smart
[1:47:58] because somebody can act with you
[1:48:01] we need to be more godly
[1:48:04] that god will use it and he saw jacob
[1:48:07] he made a trick
[1:48:08] he gathered some sticks with colors and
[1:48:10] polish whatever colors you need
[1:48:13] in the bible say when the animals come
[1:48:15] to
[1:48:16] give back the strong animals he put them
[1:48:18] in a gut straight
[1:48:20] and their eyes look on that stretch that
[1:48:22] he has made
[1:48:23] the colors that he has made there and
[1:48:25] when they give that they give it to that
[1:48:28] he's in the bible
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:37] you can check that later from verse 37
[1:48:38] or somewhere there you can get it or
[1:48:40] somewhere there you read the whole
[1:48:41] chapter there and jacob
[1:48:43] when the animals come they are in that
[1:48:44] gutter and they just look at the streets
[1:48:46] that he has made they look at it they
[1:48:49] look at it they stay looking and when
[1:48:51] they give it they call her that one
[1:48:54] so what you look at you buff it
[1:48:57] you give birth to that
[1:49:02] that's what you look at the things of
[1:49:03] the world you stay so much your focus is
[1:49:06] on the jesus you become that
[1:49:08] you begin to dress like that
[1:49:10] you begin to act like that
[1:49:12] yes that's why i don't understand why
[1:49:15] somebody will take money and say i'm
[1:49:17] going to buy a crazy jeans
[1:49:20] christy james oh of course you are crazy
[1:49:23] to go and buy christine
[1:49:25] that is stone here and it's done here
[1:49:27] and it's done here
[1:49:29] chris city and it's more expensive
[1:49:31] than property
[1:49:33] that means are you crazy indeed
[1:49:35] you lost your mind
[1:49:38] and then you walk and crazy
[1:49:42] a normal person would not wear crazy
[1:49:44] jeans
[1:49:45] i don't want to be identified with crazy
[1:49:47] people
[1:49:50] and if you look and you decide what they
[1:49:52] get those things from because they look
[1:49:54] hollywood stars some crazy person that's
[1:49:57] something some crazy person makes some
[1:49:59] hairdo and esther some crazy person
[1:50:02] watching clothing and then a sensible
[1:50:04] person like you want to act crazy
[1:50:08] brother brown said you dress like that
[1:50:10] you look at them you dress like them you
[1:50:13] are so sad with them you become like
[1:50:14] them
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:19] the amen is not coming out but it's okay
[1:50:22] [Applause]
[1:50:35] you go you take this pamphlet or
[1:50:37] whatever they call them and you look at
[1:50:39] those pamphlets or whatever you call
[1:50:40] them attack
[1:50:42] and then you look at oh they're safe
[1:50:44] here
[1:50:44] and they're like so hey oh
[1:50:48] five dollar
[1:50:50] what from 40 forte wow
[1:50:53] you look at it
[1:50:55] sometimes you don't even need that in
[1:50:56] you
[1:50:58] but just because you look at it you have
[1:51:00] been enticed
[1:51:02] you go there to the market and buy it
[1:51:04] there are things you've brought for five
[1:51:07] years you'll never touch it
[1:51:10] you look ah
[1:51:12] so i have this thing here you don't even
[1:51:14] know me
[1:51:18] amen
[1:51:19] there are many of us here we don't even
[1:51:21] know what we have
[1:51:23] you don't know what you have
[1:51:26] and you keep buying
[1:51:28] come on
[1:51:30] every day
[1:51:32] why do they display all those things
[1:51:35] because there is something about what
[1:51:36] you look at
[1:51:48] so that you don't need those things so
[1:51:49] you didn't go to the market for that
[1:51:51] thing you didn't go to the mall for that
[1:51:53] thing but you just look at hey

[1:52:04] to bring this eye under the word
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:12] what you look at affect you
[1:52:16] so we are asked to look to jesus
[1:52:20] he said look unto me

[1:52:24] stay with the word
[1:52:26] look on him
[1:52:29] so that we become like him
[1:52:31] like the india told john

[1:52:37] take the book from his right hand
[1:52:42] when you eat you become what you eat
[1:52:45] you become what you look at yes because
[1:52:48] you are feeding on that
[1:52:52] oh hallelujah what are you looking at
[1:52:54] today
[1:52:59] look at me that's what jesus said
[1:53:02] and what you look at affects you
[1:53:04] don't forget that
[1:53:07] why did the children of israel fail to
[1:53:09] enter the promised land
[1:53:12] their eyes
[1:53:13] they look at the place they look they
[1:53:16] say ah look at the joints there look at
[1:53:19] this problem
[1:53:20] look at this problem
[1:53:26] some of them look at the problems and
[1:53:28] some of them saw the opportunities yes
[1:53:31] faith say oh
[1:53:33] this is it oh wow
[1:53:35] why others look at the protestant look
[1:53:37] at the problem there look at that
[1:53:39] problem there
[1:53:42] when god proto moses took them out of
[1:53:44] the land he said you are going to allow
[1:53:46] foreign
[1:53:49] but to get to that land there were a lot
[1:53:51] of obstacles on the way
[1:53:54] somebody's had this too much problems oh
[1:53:57] yeah
[1:53:58] what some people even wanted to stay
[1:54:00] back
[1:54:01] right
[1:54:04] and i would say i thank god
[1:54:08] when the children of israel came to the
[1:54:10] red sea and they come there
[1:54:13] if they have not seen the egyptians
[1:54:14] coming after day they would have stayed
[1:54:16] there
[1:54:17] they would have said we're okay here
[1:54:19] it's okay
[1:54:21] we're okay
[1:54:22] but
[1:54:24] god has a plan
[1:54:26] god has a purpose
[1:54:28] it's not where you want to stop
[1:54:30] it is not how we want to live
[1:54:32] it is not what we want to do
[1:54:34] god will make sure whatever will move us
[1:54:38] to get to where he has to sit he will do
[1:54:40] it
[1:54:41] whether you like it or not
[1:54:43] you didn't call yourself you didn't
[1:54:45] choose yourself you can't stay where you
[1:54:47] want to stay he will make you up to get
[1:54:50] you to where you want to be
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:54:52] hallelujah
[1:54:56] do you know
[1:54:57] it wasn't the choice of mary and joseph
[1:55:00] to go to bethlehem
[1:55:02] it was not your choice they would have
[1:55:04] to stay in jerusalem
[1:55:07] it was not their choice to go to the
[1:55:09] stable to give birthday if there was no
[1:55:11] marriage choice
[1:55:13] will anybody choose that place
[1:55:16] but there is a promise
[1:55:18] there was a prophecy
[1:55:20] and the word of god might be fulfilled
[1:55:23] and god sought to eat
[1:55:25] that his word
[1:55:26] not your word not your will his will
[1:55:29] will be done and may god's will be done
[1:55:32] in our lives
[1:55:36] if you are somewhere
[1:55:37] if you are sitting somewhere if you are
[1:55:39] doing something that god is not happy
[1:55:43] may god move you out of that place
[1:55:47] force it upon you
