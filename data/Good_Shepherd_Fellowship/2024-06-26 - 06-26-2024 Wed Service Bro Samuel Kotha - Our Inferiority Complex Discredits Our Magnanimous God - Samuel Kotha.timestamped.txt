[47:36] trust and U i' like to thank you all for
[47:40] letting me in God bless you am I come
[47:43] from a country of India and I was born
[47:47] in in the place called
[47:50] Mumbai and uh the state of
[47:54] Maharashtra I like to say a little bit
[47:57] about myself so that you would know uh
[48:00] who is the man that is speaking to
[48:02] you because uh I believe it is important
[48:05] to
[48:06] know
[48:07] uh to
[48:10] know and I was uh the first child of the
[48:14] family my father he was already a a
[48:20] minister before even I was born and
[48:25] uh they had no children after their
[48:28] marriage for three years and in India I
[48:31] don't know about here I know I don't
[48:33] know about the African countries but uh
[48:36] in India if a woman is a baren then U uh
[48:40] it's a bad thing for her they will give
[48:43] many bad names and they don't even want
[48:44] to see their face so they went through
[48:49] such a bad time that time but uh they
[48:53] were praying and asking God for children
[48:55] and my father ALS said that he prayed to
[48:58] the Lord if the Lord blesses him with
[49:00] the children he will give the children
[49:03] back to God he always said that uh while
[49:07] we were growing up he always said that
[49:09] uh I promised God that uh I will give
[49:14] you all to him for his
[49:16] service and um right from my childhood
[49:19] he he put that thing you know planted
[49:22] that seed in my heart saying that I have
[49:25] to serve God when when I grew up so I
[49:29] thank the Lord for such a Godly father
[49:32] and mother that God gave me in this
[49:34] world of course they both are not here
[49:37] but uh and we grew up in a in a message
[49:40] home message believing home and we grew
[49:44] up in a message believing church and
[49:47] this message has come firsthand to me
[49:50] God was gracious on my life that uh I
[49:54] don't have to you know didn't have to go
[49:56] to different denomination to come to
[49:59] this message but I I thank God that you
[50:02] know he gave me good parents that
[50:04] believe the truth or the message of this
[50:07] hour in these last
[50:08] days so we grew up there and uh we had a
[50:13] church and at the age of 14 I gave my I
[50:17] mean at the age of 12 I gave my heart to
[50:19] the Lord Jesus Christ and uh from the
[50:23] age of 14 I started preaching this
[50:26] message
[50:28] yeah I didn't even finish my school I
[50:31] used to go to school and then help my
[50:33] father in the ministry and I was
[50:35] ordained at the age of 14 and I was
[50:37] started I started preaching the word of
[50:39] God since then I have been serving our
[50:42] Lord Jesus Christ till today and I thank
[50:46] uh
[50:46] God for his
[50:49] uh grace and mercy upon my life amen and
[50:53] uh we are three siblings I'm the first
[50:56] born one of the family and brother boas
[50:58] as our precious brother brother one said
[51:00] that uh he knows my brother also and
[51:04] he's the second one of the family and we
[51:06] have sister so we are three but uh my
[51:09] father uh he comes from a very poor
[51:12] background in in in that country and uh
[51:16] he told us that his his mother you know
[51:20] took him to Bombay of the city of Mumbai
[51:24] when my father was 7 years old because
[51:27] uh he lost his father due to Witchcraft
[51:30] and my grandmother took him and he grew
[51:32] up there and literally he was on the
[51:35] street on the put parts of the city of
[51:39] Mumbai and he grew up there and he
[51:42] studied under the street light and uh he
[51:45] finished his uh 10th grade you know in
[51:49] those days
[51:50] so because he come from a very poor
[51:53] background he wanted to take care of the
[51:55] poor children
[51:57] and uh so he adopted four children with
[52:01] us so we were seven that grew up
[52:04] together and uh then uh we were very
[52:09] poor family very
[52:11] poor um you cannot
[52:14] imagine we were growing up in a house
[52:18] that is 10 ft length and 10 ft
[52:21] breath it'll be a shocking thing to you
[52:24] that how we find people people you know
[52:27] lived in that
[52:29] house and uh then this folk joined us
[52:32] little later and uh we all grew up in
[52:36] that house can you imagine 10 ft length
[52:39] and 10 ft the breadth of the house so
[52:43] that was the size of our house that was
[52:45] our bedroom living room that was our
[52:49] drawing room and you can call whatever
[52:52] it is that was the only room we had and
[52:55] uh bathroom they used to take our bath
[52:58] it's a Indian style bath we used to take
[53:01] water in a bucket and have a little uh
[53:04] jug you know that we could pour water on
[53:06] it on our bodies and rub soap and clean
[53:09] you know and pour water that's how we
[53:11] took our bath and our bathroom size
[53:14] should be about this from here to this
[53:16] you know very small you know just a
[53:20] person can stand and place a bucket in
[53:22] that corner that's how we grew up uh you
[53:25] know in that house but we had Jesus
[53:30] there I thank God there were prayer
[53:34] meetings every morning in
[53:37] evening we used to read our Bible every
[53:39] day my father was a very kind-hearted
[53:42] man very loving person but when it comes
[53:45] to God when it comes to discipline in
[53:48] Christian Life he really taught us you
[53:51] know Godly ways to walk in this world if
[53:55] you don't read the Bible there was no
[53:57] food given to us it was uh he was very
[54:00] strict about that because the area we
[54:03] lived in was very bad that place is very
[54:06] bad people were very bad very ungodly
[54:09] when even you know very evil people the
[54:13] people the boys that grew up with us uh
[54:17] many are dead maybe except for two or
[54:19] three you know fellas everyone is dead
[54:22] with sickness and they were murdered and
[54:25] killed things like like that suicide
[54:27] some had mental problems and things like
[54:30] that so out of that uh evil
[54:34] place you know God saved our lives and
[54:39] uh you know we came as a jewels from out
[54:42] out of that place and it is uh first of
[54:46] all I'll give the credit to the Lord
[54:47] Jesus Christ then my father and mother
[54:51] that prayed on their knees as the oldest
[54:54] son
[54:56] as the oldest son you know uh I used to
[55:01] hear my father praying in the night
[55:04] getting about 2:00 and 3:00 and he was
[55:06] praying was kneeling our near our heads
[55:09] and he used to cry raise up his hand and
[55:12] say Lord you have given this children
[55:14] and I give them back to you protect them
[55:17] from all evils Lord and you know I want
[55:20] them to serve you father that was his
[55:22] always that prayer because he gave the
[55:24] word to the Lord and when I was was 12
[55:27] the Lord uh touched me and I gave my
[55:29] heart to the Lord and he filled me the
[55:31] filled me with the Holy Ghost and uh the
[55:34] age of 14 I started preaching and um as
[55:38] I was growing up in
[55:41] 1989 it was uh before that much before
[55:46] that I mean few few year months before
[55:50] uh I'm speaking about 1989 December but
[55:53] few months before the Lord spoke to my
[55:55] grand mother telling her that uh I have
[55:59] no work in Mumbai and I have a great
[56:02] work to be to do in in the city of
[56:05] Hyderabad and uh she told me that
[56:08] morning and I said Grandma don't tell
[56:11] this to anyone because uh you know uh
[56:15] what I will do because I didn't know my
[56:17] own mother tongue and uh my mother
[56:20] tongue is Telo and uh it's I said don't
[56:24] tell but by the time everyone was up she
[56:28] be to tell what the Lord told her in the
[56:31] in the in the dream so but anyhow I
[56:34] didn't wanted to go to the place called
[56:35] Hyderabad which I come from now and uh
[56:38] few years later a few months later the
[56:41] Lord begin to deal with me
[56:43] personally but still I you know
[56:45] neglected and I didn't want it to go
[56:48] because I didn't like because we had a
[56:50] church about 60 70 people they used to
[56:52] come and we were good you know and uh we
[56:55] could speak the language Hindi marati
[56:57] and English and uh we always U uh
[57:01] represented us or identified us as a as
[57:05] a maharashtrian you know not even a
[57:07] Telugu speaking people and we never knew
[57:09] our own language but brother and sister
[57:11] when God started dealing with me I
[57:13] really got very nervous and I didn't
[57:15] want it to go even the second time the
[57:18] Lord uh begin to deal with my heart you
[57:21] know the Lord showed me vision and
[57:23] things like that but I just neglected it
[57:25] because I just didn't want it to
[57:27] go so In December
[57:30] 1989 we had special meeting nearby our
[57:34] church about half an hour or 25 minutes
[57:37] drive from our place and uh our brother
[57:40] came from down south and they had
[57:43] special meetings three three days and uh
[57:45] we went the first day and uh we heard
[57:49] the sermon and we came back and we went
[57:51] back the second day so they started the
[57:54] service and they started reading you
[57:56] know the word of God and the preacher
[57:58] begin to preach and as he was preaching
[58:02] I was sitting like this in a corner to
[58:04] his right hand side and he paused in the
[58:06] middle of the sermon and he pointed
[58:09] towards me he took my name he said
[58:10] Brother Sam he said the Lord told me
[58:13] last time last night to tell you that
[58:16] you have no business in the city of
[58:18] Mumbai and uh there is a great work of
[58:21] God to be done in
[58:24] Hyderabad and um I was okay till this
[58:27] point but when he said this is the third
[58:30] time the Lord is speaking to you that
[58:34] really shook
[58:36] me he he was so specific to to tell me
[58:39] that this was the third time he was
[58:41] speaking to me so that night we went
[58:45] back home and next morning we spoke
[58:48] together you know Dad Mom everyone and
[58:51] uh said we have to do something we have
[58:53] to take decision to go to Hyderabad
[58:55] because was you know last night as the
[58:58] man of God said this is the third time
[59:01] and uh you know Dad said let's think
[59:04] about it pray and uh let's do so In
[59:08] December
[59:10] 1989 they started shifting to go to the
[59:14] city of Hyderabad and uh when we shifted
[59:20] here in 1990 March uh we totally came to
[59:26] Hyderabad because we shifted very slowly
[59:29] we had to find a house and rent first
[59:31] and then shift little little you know
[59:33] things from Mumbai and it's about 700
[59:36] kilomet about roughly about 625 miles or
[59:40] 650 miles you know so we did that and by
[59:44] March 1990 we were there we we came and
[59:48] settled down in Hyderabad and we started
[59:50] uh the church you know with with our
[59:53] family members because we didn't know
[59:55] anyone and um of course my mother's side
[59:59] uh we had some relatives and but they
[1:00:01] were in the medanite group and uh they
[1:00:04] were going to some other denomination so
[1:00:08] uh of course we took their help to look
[1:00:10] for an house in a good area and uh they
[1:00:13] really helped us but um when we started
[1:00:17] you know it was just our family and uh
[1:00:19] we used to sing songs in Hindi and pray
[1:00:22] in Hindi preach in Hindi and uh when
[1:00:25] people used to
[1:00:26] you know uh listen to our songs and
[1:00:29] preaching neighbors people started
[1:00:31] knowing that oh there is a prayer
[1:00:33] meeting you know they do it in uh in uh
[1:00:36] in their house so people used to come
[1:00:38] people used to come and people used to
[1:00:41] you know attend for one or two weeks or
[1:00:43] three weeks and they stopped come you
[1:00:45] know coming and we used to ask them what
[1:00:47] is the problem why they don't why they
[1:00:49] uh stopped coming to church he said hey
[1:00:52] the problem is we don't understand the
[1:00:53] language you speak see that was a great
[1:00:57] question in my heart too be and that's
[1:00:59] the reason that I didn't want it to
[1:01:01] didn't want it to you know come to
[1:01:03] Hyderabad but anyhow so you know my dad
[1:01:06] used to preach a lot because uh he spoke
[1:01:09] this language a little bit and even his
[1:01:12] Telo was broken and uh it was not a very
[1:01:15] good uh language because our language is
[1:01:18] spoken very
[1:01:19] respectfully and being you know he was
[1:01:22] seven when he went to Bombay and grew up
[1:01:24] there and he lived almost his life
[1:01:26] almost so his language also was very
[1:01:29] poor compared to the people who lived
[1:01:31] there but anyhow you know we we kept
[1:01:35] going on till five six years like that
[1:01:37] and a brother helped used to help me uh
[1:01:41] in translating so because my dad was
[1:01:43] preaching a lot you know I went to other
[1:01:46] places and and preached uh this truth
[1:01:50] and um when we came to this uh place you
[1:01:53] know Andra Pradesh this state they had
[1:01:56] only seven message preachers that time
[1:01:59] but today by God's grace there are
[1:02:01] hundreds and thousands of people you
[1:02:04] know in the state of Andra Pradesh of
[1:02:07] course now the state is divided into two
[1:02:09] it's Telangana where I come from and
[1:02:11] then Andra Pradesh where my wife comes
[1:02:13] from but anyhow you know there are
[1:02:16] thousand even if you print 10,000 books
[1:02:18] at this point the books will not be
[1:02:20] sufficient so there are more than 10
[1:02:23] 12,000 uh people in the message
[1:02:26] in in Telugu speaking States so I'm
[1:02:29] really thankful to God but the thing is
[1:02:32] this uh five six years I I went around
[1:02:35] those four or five districts and I
[1:02:37] preached this truth and you know
[1:02:39] preached this message and uh the Lord
[1:02:42] was good but then the brother that used
[1:02:44] to translate for me he said uh I will
[1:02:47] not be available for you brother to
[1:02:49] translate and help you see that was my
[1:02:52] turning point and I had to come to that
[1:02:55] point
[1:02:56] because God had to you
[1:02:59] know he had to show me his power in my
[1:03:04] life he had to bring me to a reality
[1:03:08] that I was in his will and he wanted to
[1:03:11] do something from my life so I came back
[1:03:14] from a meeting with very sadness and I
[1:03:17] was I was brokenhearted brother sisters
[1:03:20] but uh you know I came and uh I told my
[1:03:24] father and mother and my wife wife and
[1:03:26] and straight away that was Thursday
[1:03:28] morning that I came from the
[1:03:30] meeting and I straight over went to the
[1:03:33] to the fasting till Sunday so I never
[1:03:37] ate anything I just kept praying and
[1:03:39] asking God you know to help me because
[1:03:42] here I I stand at a junction now and I
[1:03:45] don't know which way to take turn so I
[1:03:48] said Lord you have to do something and
[1:03:49] help me you know how I should go further
[1:03:52] what is the next uh uh step I have to
[1:03:55] put
[1:03:56] and uh you'll be surprised when I say
[1:03:59] certain thing that Sunday I woke up and
[1:04:02] you know we he got ready to the church
[1:04:05] and uh we just started singing and uh
[1:04:08] worshiping the Lord and I said this is
[1:04:10] the last Sunday we are going to sing in
[1:04:12] Hindi from next Sunday we going to sing
[1:04:14] Telugu
[1:04:16] songs so everyone was like
[1:04:20] okay and uh but they didn't know how to
[1:04:22] do it so what we used to do we used to
[1:04:25] to you know learn Telugu songs and write
[1:04:28] it in Hindi and I used to write it in
[1:04:30] English Telugu songs in English language
[1:04:33] I used to write and that is how we used
[1:04:35] to sing so I hope you understand we used
[1:04:40] because we can read and write Hindi
[1:04:41] marati and English and Telugu was
[1:04:44] something uh if I show you the language
[1:04:47] it is all
[1:04:48] circles so it's very hard to understand
[1:04:51] you know the language so but anyhow we
[1:04:53] used to write in English and some people
[1:04:56] used to write in Hindi and sing in the
[1:04:58] church in telu songs next from next time
[1:05:01] and then after the when the time came to
[1:05:03] preach I came in the Pulpit I said uh
[1:05:05] let's pray and this will be the last
[1:05:07] prayer I'll be praying in Hindi language
[1:05:10] and uh I in my prayer I said Lord I
[1:05:13] don't know what you're going to do but I
[1:05:17] came to the city on your
[1:05:19] word and I didn't want it to come and
[1:05:22] you know that but you sp spoke to me
[1:05:25] three times
[1:05:26] and and you sent me to this place so I
[1:05:29] don't know what you're going to do Lord
[1:05:31] as I said amen you as I say amen I want
[1:05:34] you to help me to speak this
[1:05:38] language and when I prayed and uh the
[1:05:41] anointing of God came so much on me
[1:05:44] brother sister and I said amen I
[1:05:47] automatically started preaching speaking
[1:05:50] in my mother tongue which is Telo that's
[1:05:53] the first time in my life
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:05:56] I started speaking or preaching in my
[1:05:59] own mother tongue you wouldn't believe
[1:06:02] what God did on that day and since then
[1:06:05] I I pre I started speaking in Telugu
[1:06:08] language in our church and then uh after
[1:06:11] a few months God helped me to read the
[1:06:13] language I never been to the school and
[1:06:17] uh I don't know even the letters of the
[1:06:20] alphabets and the language you know
[1:06:22] there's a there it is very tough I will
[1:06:25] show if you want how telu is written but
[1:06:28] um you know I was like a crazy
[1:06:32] fellow uh I was really crazy I would put
[1:06:35] my Hindi Bible first and then put my
[1:06:38] English Bible and I and I bought a
[1:06:40] Telugu Bible for myself and I used to
[1:06:43] put it there and I went studying several
[1:06:46] months you know these two language
[1:06:49] Bibles and this one I couldn't even
[1:06:53] understand or read anything from it but
[1:06:55] I just kept looking at that I could read
[1:06:58] Hindi Bible I could read English Bible I
[1:07:00] can understand it but this Telugu Bible
[1:07:03] nothing but one day after several
[1:07:07] months somehow I started reading yes I
[1:07:11] don't know how it happened but it
[1:07:14] happened and it happened in my
[1:07:18] life you say our God is a God of Wonders

[1:07:26] does he miracles in our lives yes he

[1:07:36] Brethren used to come from uh from
[1:07:39] United States we had problems with the
[1:07:42] translation and then you know my daddy
[1:07:44] literally pushed me one day he said hey
[1:07:47] you can preach now so you try to
[1:07:49] translate in in Telo you know unless you
[1:07:53] have a Telo Bible and you can read it
[1:07:55] fluently you know it's very hard to
[1:07:58] translate but I stood there I I took uh
[1:08:01] help from a brother from a church I said
[1:08:03] you read loud I when I say the scripture
[1:08:05] you open the Bible you read the
[1:08:07] scripture and then I'll speak with the
[1:08:09] preacher and I did by God's grace I can
[1:08:13] preach I can read Telo Bible and I can

[1:18:16] can you say amen amen praise the Lord
[1:18:18] the word of the Lord is wonderful isn't
[1:18:20] it I would like to just title this
[1:18:22] evening um our parity complex discredits
[1:18:27] our magnanimous
[1:18:30] God we have lot of complexes in our
[1:18:34] lives think about it brothers sisters we
[1:18:37] have our
[1:18:39] insecurities you know that diminish the
[1:18:42] magnificence of our god of our God
[1:18:46] sometimes we underestimate
[1:18:49] ourselves and when we underestimate
[1:18:51] ourselves we underestimate Our God yes
[1:18:55] yes to underestimate means
[1:18:58] underrate to place too low a value
[1:19:02] on and the scriptures that we have read
[1:19:05] God said Thou Art mine yes he says I
[1:19:08] have chosen you and he said I have known
[1:19:11] you I have redeemed you he said he said
[1:19:14] I have given ransom for thee for Egypt
[1:19:18] Ethiopia and shivba and he says when
[1:19:20] thou pass through the waters I will be
[1:19:23] with thee and through the rivers they
[1:19:26] shall not overflow thee when thou
[1:19:28] walkest through the fires thou shallal
[1:19:30] not be burned neither shall the flame
[1:19:31] Kindle upon thee now these are the
[1:19:34] wonderful scriptures that God spoke
[1:19:37] about his children you may say Brother
[1:19:40] Sam this is for the people of Israel yes
[1:19:42] I believe that this this is a prophecy
[1:19:45] but we can apply it to our lives because
[1:19:47] we Are Spiritual
[1:19:49] Israelites and he says because thou has
[1:19:52] precious in my sight thou has been
[1:19:54] honorable and I have loved thee
[1:19:56] therefore will I give men for thee and
[1:19:59] people for thy life fear not I am with
[1:20:03] thee I would like to repeat one more
[1:20:06] time fear not for I am with thee I will
[1:20:09] bring thy seed from the East gather thee
[1:20:12] from the west and he'll speak to the
[1:20:14] North and South he says keep not back my
[1:20:16] sons and daughters give them up and let
[1:20:19] my daughters and sons come from the ends
[1:20:22] of the Earth so we know that God is is
[1:20:25] is trying to gather his people all over
[1:20:28] the world from east west north south
[1:20:31] people is gathering his children but I
[1:20:33] want one thing you SS to put it in your
[1:20:36] heart tonight that you belong to God and
[1:20:40] God loves you he says when you go
[1:20:43] through the waters I am with you he says
[1:20:47] when you go through the rivers they will
[1:20:49] not overflow you when you go through the
[1:20:51] fire they will not burn you because you
[1:20:54] belong to him he's our God and he's our
[1:20:58] savior that's what the Bible says 1 John
[1:21:00] 4:4 says he are of God little children
[1:21:03] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:21:06] that is in you that he that than he that
[1:21:09] is in the world he says the one that is
[1:21:11] in US is greater then Jeremiah 31:3 says
[1:21:15] the Lord had appeared of old to me
[1:21:17] saying yeah I have loved thee with an
[1:21:19] Everlasting Love Therefore with loving
[1:21:22] kindness I have drawn thee
[1:21:25] he wants to you know draw Us near to him
[1:21:29] because we are his children now
[1:21:32] Ephesians chapter 2: 10 says for we are
[1:21:35] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[1:21:38] unto good works which God had before
[1:21:41] ordained that we should walk in them now
[1:21:45] taking all this scripture into into the
[1:21:47] account Brothers sister we are his
[1:21:50] children God is our God and he's our
[1:21:53] help in the time time of troubles
[1:21:55] present help in the time of troubles you
[1:21:58] know he has created us in Christ Jesus
[1:22:02] and uh we are his workmanship we are
[1:22:04] made by his hands and we are his
[1:22:07] children but now we live in this
[1:22:11] world this world is full of Sorrow just
[1:22:15] like the Bible says in the Book of Job
[1:22:17] chapter 14 he said the one that is born
[1:22:19] of a woman is for a short period of time
[1:22:22] and have multi itude of of problems or
[1:22:26] sorrows in their lives so you know when
[1:22:29] we look at the circumstances that we are
[1:22:31] in when we look at our sickness that we
[1:22:34] have in our bodies and we we we we think
[1:22:37] about it and you know when we when we
[1:22:39] see the situation around us or the
[1:22:42] circumstances around us and we become
[1:22:45] hopeless we think we are left without
[1:22:48] any hope and uh you know we think that
[1:22:51] uh we are no good and uh uh we under
[1:22:54] imate God and his power because we try
[1:22:58] to run Helter Skelter in our
[1:23:02] situations I would like you to just just
[1:23:05] uh think about this this uh lines that
[1:23:07] I'm reading for you from the message
[1:23:09] God's provided place of worship is a
[1:23:12] wonderful message that the prophet has
[1:23:14] spoken and I know you have already heard
[1:23:17] it and read it it says remember when God
[1:23:20] speaks a word he can never take it back
[1:23:24] now now the scriptures that we have read
[1:23:27] this is the word of God and if God has
[1:23:31] spoken a word he said he will never take
[1:23:34] it back why he has to ever remain if he
[1:23:38] has to ever remain the same he can never
[1:23:41] say something and say things that we
[1:23:45] think
[1:23:46] oh and then say well I didn't exactly
[1:23:49] mean that see he's infinite he knows the
[1:23:54] best best to begin with so because he
[1:23:58] knows the best to begin with when he
[1:24:02] speaks it is
[1:24:04] eternal and he's he's not finite like us
[1:24:08] like we say things and next we come up
[1:24:11] brother Brenham says we come back and we
[1:24:13] take those words back because we are
[1:24:16] human being but if with God he's not
[1:24:20] like that if you has spoken the word it
[1:24:23] remains there yes and it doesn't change
[1:24:26] and his word will never fail God never
[1:24:30] fails praise the Lord he says you know
[1:24:33] uh but God can do that and remain God he
[1:24:37] cannot act like us and remain like God
[1:24:41] he cannot say something today and
[1:24:43] tomorrow morning he says he wait a
[1:24:45] minute it is not the way I think you
[1:24:47] know this is the way I think and he and
[1:24:49] he you know Alters his word it doesn't
[1:24:51] happen like that the heavens and the
[1:24:54] Earth will pass away but not his word
[1:24:57] not even a jot or a title will fail the
[1:24:58] Bible says so even a jot or a title is

[1:27:30] work that's why we are facing you know
[1:27:32] we are being conquered by the
[1:27:34] circumstances we are being conquered by
[1:27:37] the by the situations that we are you
[1:27:39] know having around us by our Feelings by
[1:27:42] our reasonings
[1:27:44] yes I'm preaching on on on the going or
[1:27:48] looking beyond the the sense of
[1:27:50] reasoning I preached 22 parts and
[1:27:53] brothers sister it goes you know when
[1:27:56] you dig more for the word of God it you
[1:27:58] know it's like a a big uh you know what
[1:28:01] do you call it's a mind like you keep
[1:28:04] digging the word you'll find something
[1:28:06] you know great and
[1:28:08] wonderful reasoning has taken over our
[1:28:11] lives we live by our feelings sometimes
[1:28:14] I don't know about here but you ask
[1:28:16] people in India why didn't you come to
[1:28:17] when vday prayer he said oh I was not
[1:28:20] feeling
[1:28:22] good somebody say oh I have a I had a
[1:28:25] back pain oh some will say I had a
[1:28:28] headache and that's why I couldn't come
[1:28:30] some would say I was busy some would say
[1:28:33] I was with my
[1:28:34] friends we make all these kinds of lame
[1:28:38] excuses
[1:28:40] reasonings and uh our feelings have
[1:28:43] taken over our
[1:28:45] lives if you believe that say
[1:28:48] amen I get nervous when you people are
[1:28:51] silent
[1:28:54] I have known African people uh they are
[1:28:57] very
[1:29:00] Lively but you're afraid you go by how
[1:29:04] you feel because you have regarded that
[1:29:07] you lived by your feeling your whole
[1:29:09] life has been wrapped in that see it's
[1:29:12] not me it's a prophet our whole life is
[1:29:15] wrapped by the feeling that we have
[1:29:18] today don't you think brother sister
[1:29:21] when God speaks a word
[1:29:24] it's an eternal word and it is the word
[1:29:27] of God and it's not going to change if
[1:29:30] God has given us a promise is more than
[1:29:32] able to perform
[1:29:34] it well then why we need to give place
[1:29:37] to the
[1:29:38] feeling why we need to give place to the
[1:29:41] reasoning why we keep reasoning you know
[1:29:44] if the doctor said you have
[1:29:46] cancer and he will say you're not going
[1:29:49] to
[1:29:50] live now the Bible says you are healed
[1:29:53] by the stripes he had now there are two
[1:29:56] things that God has placed before you
[1:29:58] and me brother sister are you going to
[1:30:00] take you know what the doctor said or
[1:30:02] are you going to take what God
[1:30:05] Said this way you you know you will you
[1:30:08] will bring credit to
[1:30:11] God you will bring Victory to your own
[1:30:14] life what you going to
[1:30:17] take think about it brothers
[1:30:19] sisters he says our whole life has been
[1:30:22] wrapped up by our field ings by
[1:30:25] reasoning but you must get away from
[1:30:28] that and act on God's word not on what
[1:30:32] you feel not what you see but what God
[1:30:35] Said act on that make a confession of
[1:30:39] that confess means to say the same thing
[1:30:43] and he's at the right hand of the father
[1:30:45] with his own blood to make intercession
[1:30:47] for your confession whatever we confess
[1:30:50] God intercedes that and that's why
[1:30:54] brother sister we need to speak positive
[1:30:56] things we need to think positive we have
[1:31:00] to get rid of all negative stuff we need
[1:31:02] to get away from all our feelings and
[1:31:05] all our reasonings because God is
[1:31:07] greater than our feeling God is greater
[1:31:10] than our reasoning God is greater than
[1:31:12] our sickness God is greater than our
[1:31:16] circumstances God is greater than
[1:31:22] everything and because we belong to him
[1:31:26] and he is our
[1:31:28] God you can ask him you can talk to
[1:31:32] him you can confess good
[1:31:35] things and he will intercede for
[1:31:38] you amen what a God we have
[1:31:41] today let's go a little further he says
[1:31:44] now he cannot do anything for you until
[1:31:46] first you accept it and confess
[1:31:49] it and here we sometimes stand said oh
[1:31:52] brother I'm praying but I'm not getting
[1:31:55] any answer God is not hearing my prayer
[1:31:57] God is not answering my
[1:31:59] prayer I can show you one strong reason
[1:32:03] why God answer doesn't answer our
[1:32:06] prayer and that's not my word
[1:32:10] actually I can show you what the prophet
[1:32:16] said you like to hear
[1:32:19] that I'm reading a little bit from
[1:32:23] believing God
[1:32:26] this is not in my notes that I'm
[1:32:28] preaching and he says I know this that
[1:32:31] some of us has more faith than others
[1:32:35] and those who have abundance of Faith
[1:32:37] are supposed to pray for those those who
[1:32:40] don't have
[1:32:42] faith we have to pray pray for them but
[1:32:45] if you don't live the right kind of
[1:32:49] life if you don't live the right kind of
[1:32:52] life
[1:32:54] you better leave away from
[1:32:56] it he says you better stop
[1:32:59] praying if you don't live
[1:33:02] right you don't stop
[1:33:05] praying because the devil will laugh at
[1:33:09] your
[1:33:10] prayer if we don't live right and we
[1:33:13] keep praying the devil he laughs at our
[1:33:18] prayer think about
[1:33:21] it but when you live right
[1:33:24] and do
[1:33:25] right when you live right and do right
[1:33:30] and act right and have faith in God
[1:33:33] Satan will tremble when you
[1:33:36] speak C God swore under obligation he
[1:33:41] would take care of that
[1:33:44] prayer the prayer when we live right and
[1:33:48] pray Satan trembles and God takes care
[1:33:52] of that prayer

[1:34:04] this world with all inferiority complex
[1:34:07] we are so inferior
[1:34:10] sometimes we think that we are hopeless
[1:34:13] and we think about ourselves so
[1:34:16] low and the Bible is speaking something
[1:34:19] else about

[1:42:32] silver TI uh grizzly bear that brother
[1:42:36] Bram spoke had brother brother Eddie
[1:42:38] bisol and brother Blain with him and the
[1:42:42] vision showed him that you know there
[1:42:44] will be a silver tip Grizzly beer and
[1:42:47] brother Bram is going to shoot it and he
[1:42:49] sh the wision you know he shoot at his
[1:42:52] heart
[1:42:53] and do you know the story how brother
[1:42:55] bam explains it more than one time in
[1:42:57] the message but I've taken proof in his
[1:43:00] word he said according to the
[1:43:02] vision we going I'm going to have
[1:43:06] it and they were coming you know coming
[1:43:09] to that's a long story but just to cut
[1:43:13] short that story and you know here comes
[1:43:15] a time that they ask will you have it
[1:43:19] are you going to get it brother Bram he
[1:43:22] said the vision told me
[1:43:24] this grizzly BL bear should be somewhere
[1:43:26] else around one of the brothers said I
[1:43:29] can see 50 miles from here and I don't
[1:43:32] see that bear he said the vision said
[1:43:36] the Lord said it it's thus say the
[1:43:39] Lord if he could create a ram for
[1:43:42] Abraham he would create that grizzly
[1:43:45] bear for the prophet of
[1:43:47] God well he believed it and here he sees
[1:43:51] less than less than 500 yards he stand
[1:43:54] that gzz Grizzly you know
[1:43:57] bear and as in as the Brethren say he
[1:43:59] said brother brandom have you ever shot
[1:44:01] this he said no and the gun he had was a
[1:44:03] very small bullet he a 250 mm some small
[1:44:07] bullets he said and he
[1:44:10] said this grizzly bear doesn't know what
[1:44:13] death is so you have to be very careful
[1:44:16] brother brandham while shooting then he
[1:44:18] says in the vision I saw I shoot you
[1:44:21] know at the heart of that animal and he
[1:44:24] says as they were talking this bear
[1:44:27] looked at brother Bram and he says
[1:44:29] that's it he was getting charged to
[1:44:33] attack these
[1:44:34] people he said you know he took the gun
[1:44:38] and and and targeted it and shooted that
[1:44:40] animal and it was still charging towards
[1:44:45] them I think brother Blain say he said
[1:44:48] brother bham I didn't have I didn't
[1:44:50] wanted that animal to have it in my lab
[1:44:52] brother answer say I didn't even I don't
[1:44:54] neither want to have it in my lab he
[1:44:57] says less than 50 yard that animal

[1:48:18] the Holy Ghost he comes down and let his
[1:48:21] picture be taken with us he's talking
[1:48:22] about the picture the the pillar of fire
[1:48:25] over his head you know we also have the
[1:48:28] picture of cloud he's doing everything
[1:48:30] that he can do to show you not to join
[1:48:34] Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal or or
[1:48:36] brandom Tabernacle but join to Jesus
[1:48:42] Christ of course we don't have
[1:48:46] denominations and he's not asking us to
[1:48:48] join brandom Tabernacle no he's asking
[1:48:51] us to join to Jesus Christ Christ
[1:48:53] believe in him everything no matter what
[1:48:56] the church you're going to that doesn't
[1:48:58] have nothing to do with it it's your
[1:49:00] heart with God what God looks at that's
[1:49:03] right believe in him as a supernatural
[1:49:05] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ God is
[1:49:08] looking into our hearts
[1:49:10] tonight it's not that where you are and
[1:49:12] how you are and which church we belong
[1:49:14] and you know how good we are and nothing
[1:49:17] like that it's your heart it's our heart
[1:49:19] that God is looking into now brother
[1:49:22] sister we are coming to the point where
[1:49:25] you know we know God we know God by
[1:49:28] scriptures and we know God by
[1:49:30] relationship with
[1:49:32] him that's right we need to we need to
[1:49:35] check our relationship with our God
[1:49:37] tonight because relationship is is very
[1:49:41] very
[1:49:42] important I know my wife more than
[1:49:46] anybody in this
[1:49:48] world includes her father or siblings
[1:49:52] whatever
[1:49:53] I know her better than anybody in this
[1:49:55] world is that right brother one you know
[1:49:58] Sister one more than
[1:50:01] anybody because of the relationship
[1:50:05] yeah because of the
[1:50:08] intimacy we
[1:50:10] have have you known Christ in your
[1:50:14] life is it just a a a savior of the
[1:50:18] world to you is it just a A Healer of
[1:50:23] the sick to you
[1:50:25] people or is he a god of Christians or
[1:50:29] is he just a
[1:50:31] Creator and so
[1:50:34] on what do you think about
[1:50:40] him we don't want assuming unbelievers
[1:50:43] to teach teach us about God we don't
[1:50:46] want to assume
[1:50:48] him we want to know him in reality
[1:50:53] with a relationship a personal
[1:50:56] relationship and when it comes to
[1:50:57] personal relationship my father's
[1:51:00] experience was not enough for
[1:51:02] me
[1:51:05] right or my mother's experience was
[1:51:07] wasn't good for me I myself had to have
[1:51:11] personal relationship with my
[1:51:16] savior glory and now I have come to a
[1:51:19] place where no power in Hell or in this
[1:51:22] world can shake me there's no power in
[1:51:25] this world that could move me from the
[1:51:28] word of
[1:51:29] God that's the kind of a relation we
[1:51:32] need today nothing can move me that's
[1:51:36] right that's how we need to know your
[1:51:40] God it's not just by intellectual you
[1:51:44] know reading or understanding the
[1:51:47] scriptures that is the problem today
[1:51:50] with the message people they have taken
[1:51:52] the intellectual part of the message and
[1:51:55] left out the life of the message life of
[1:51:58] God that's right that's right brother
[1:52:01] intellectual part is good that's right I
[1:52:03] love
[1:52:05] it but we need to have the
[1:52:08] life life that this message has has
[1:52:12] brought us
[1:52:13] to that God is required of us it's not
[1:52:17] only studying and reading and putting
[1:52:20] the Cotes in our mind come on it's the
[1:52:22] wor God in our
[1:52:25] throne and thrown on our control
[1:52:30] tower we need to know him
[1:52:34] personally oh Hallelujah we need to
[1:52:37] understand him his power
[1:52:45] personally when we underestimate God our
[1:52:48] expectation of him becomes very low
[1:52:53] we underestimate how much he loves
[1:52:58] us when we talk about
[1:53:01] God his
[1:53:03] love God's love is
[1:53:06] unconditional and it is
[1:53:10] complete his love is unconditional and
[1:53:14] complete Paul says in Romans
[1:53:17] 8 verse 38 and 39 for I persuaded that
[1:53:21] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[1:53:24] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:53:27] present nor things to come nor height
[1:53:29] nor death nor any other creature shall
[1:53:32] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:53:34] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[1:53:39] did you see what what all the things he
[1:53:42] said death life Angels principalities
[1:53:48] Powers nothing present nothing to come
[1:53:52] God nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:53:55] creature shall be
[1:53:58] able will be able to separate you my
[1:54:01] sisters my brother separate you from the
[1:54:04] love of
[1:54:06] God it is impossible for any
[1:54:12] creature whether it is death or whether
[1:54:15] it is life or Angels or
[1:54:18] principalities
[1:54:21] whatever nothing
[1:54:23] can separate us from the love of
[1:54:27] God we underestimate sometimes his
[1:54:31] power sometimes things become
[1:54:35] overwhelming at
[1:54:39] times and the
[1:54:42] enemy I want you to know the enemy isn't
[1:54:45] more powerful than
[1:54:47] God because we read the read in the
[1:54:50] Bible he that is in you is greater than
[1:54:53] that is in the world in Ephesians 610
[1:54:56] reads like this finally my brethren be
[1:54:58] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:55:01] His
[1:55:02] might we should never underestimate his
[1:55:05] power we underestimate his plans and
[1:55:08] direction for our
[1:55:10] lives that means god did not just create
[1:55:13] us went back to his throne in heaven and
[1:55:16] he's just waiting to see you know how we
[1:55:19] are trying to make up our lives he never
[1:55:21] he never did that
[1:55:23] if you can read Psalm 139 verse 1-6 you
[1:55:26] will understand what God did after he
[1:55:28] created
[1:55:29] you he say this a Psalm of David oh Lord
[1:55:32] thou H has searched me and known
[1:55:36] me my precious brothers and sister he
[1:55:39] knows you he has searched you my sisters
[1:55:43] and he has known you thou knowest my
[1:55:46] Downs sitting my Uprising thou
[1:55:49] understand my thought a far off before
[1:55:52] the even the thought comes to your mind
[1:55:54] he already knows what you're going to
[1:55:56] think after one second he knows it
[1:55:59] brother and sister thou compassion my PO
[1:56:02] by lying laying down and art acquainted
[1:56:04] with all my ways all my ways that means
[1:56:09] there is no way that is hidden to your
[1:56:12] God there is nothing that you can hide
[1:56:18] right young children listen to me
[1:56:21] whatever you do or whatever you follow
[1:56:24] in this world remember God is watching
[1:56:28] you and you cannot hide it from him for
[1:56:32] there is not a word in my tongue but L
[1:56:34] Lord thou knowest it all together before
[1:56:37] a word come to my mouth he knows it thou
[1:56:40] Hast vised me behind and before and laid
[1:56:43] thine hand upon me such knowledge is too
[1:56:46] wonderful for me it is high I cannot
[1:56:49] attain unto it so never never
[1:56:54] underestimate his plans and his
[1:56:57] directions for our lives if he has
[1:57:00] created you he knows your future we sing
[1:57:03] that song right do we sing that song he
[1:57:07] knows my future because he
[1:57:12] lives right Because He Lives I Can Face
[1:57:18] tomorrow because he
[1:57:20] lives he holds my my future
[1:57:25] yes well sometimes you only sing but you
[1:57:28] know we don't mean
[1:57:29] it that's right that's the problem with
[1:57:32] us that's right so never underestimate
[1:57:35] his plans and direction for our
[1:57:37] lives oh brother I wanted to St so many
[1:57:43] things we underestimate his mercy and
[1:57:47] forgiveness and it's tragic
[1:57:52] because many times we carry around and
[1:57:54] you know remorse from our sins that God
[1:57:57] has erased from his memory
[1:58:01] yeah I've gone through many states in
[1:58:03] America and prayed for some hundred PE
[1:58:06] hundreds of people after the sermon they
[1:58:08] used to come and pray and you know there
[1:58:10] are people some Sometimes they come and
[1:58:12] say Brother Sam my my past is hunting
[1:58:19] me my past is haunting me
[1:58:24] I told to one sister one day I said
[1:58:25] sister
[1:58:27] dear when he comes and tells you about
[1:58:30] your
[1:58:31] past take
[1:58:33] courage look into his
[1:58:35] eyes look into his faceu and tell him
[1:58:39] about his
[1:58:41] future if he tries to REM remind your
[1:58:45] past tell him his future he will never
[1:58:49] dare to come to you
[1:58:52] but you know brother sister when we
[1:58:54] underestimate him his power his Mercy
[1:58:58] his
[1:59:00] forgiveness don't underestimate
[1:59:04] devil there are more quotes that Prophet
[1:59:08] brought to us he says don't
[1:59:10] underestimate the devil don't don't try
[1:59:13] to think he's he's weak or something
[1:59:16] don't underestimate him he can do
[1:59:19] anything he
[1:59:20] said I was reading this morning many
[1:59:22] quotes he he said don't underestimate
[1:59:25] the devil
[1:59:27] never because he's
[1:59:29] powerful but we are talking about God
[1:59:31] tonight Our
[1:59:34] God never underestimate his mercy of
[1:59:38] forgiveness Psalm 103:2 says as far as
[1:59:41] the East is from the West so far hath he
[1:59:43] removed my transgression from us can you
[1:59:46] see the east from here no forget about
[1:59:50] it
[1:59:53] brother Billy Paul one day he was
[1:59:54] testifying somewhere he said God put our
[1:59:58] sins in the sea of
[1:59:59] forgetfulness and he put a Playard there
[2:00:02] do not
[2:00:06] fish fishing
[2:00:11] prohibited that's how our God is
[2:00:15] yes brother this visual contrast the
[2:00:18] picture of self- condemnation of
[2:00:20] carrying our sins and regrets on our
[2:00:22] bags everywhere we
[2:00:25] go look at this
[2:00:28] visual God has put your sins and your
[2:00:32] transgressions in the sea of
[2:00:34] forgetfulness he doesn't even remember
[2:00:36] brother
[2:00:38] sister why we must remember
[2:00:41] today why we must remember our about our
[2:00:44] sisters our brothers oh he did this she
[2:00:46] did that you know why we remember those
[2:00:49] things God doesn't remember praise the
[2:00:52] Lord hallelujah he doesn't remember our
[2:00:56] sins he put it in the sea of
[2:00:58] forgetfulness you can read Romans 81 and
[2:01:01] 2 lamentation 322 and 23 speaks about
[2:01:04] compassion be you know fail it not and
[2:01:06] and brother sisters compassion is new
[2:01:08] every
[2:01:09] morning I'll give this service to the
[2:01:12] man of
[2:01:13] God many times we underestimate his
[2:01:15] compassion towards
[2:01:19] us oh God doesn't know how how I'm
[2:01:22] suffering have you heard it anytime
[2:01:24] Believers speaking to the
[2:01:26] Believers he doesn't see my
[2:01:30] suffering I'm suffering so
[2:01:33] much well he was 100% man he was 100%
[2:01:37] God but the Bible says Hebrews 4:15 we
[2:01:41] have for we have not an high priest
[2:01:43] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[2:01:45] of
[2:01:45] our infirmities but was in all points
[2:01:49] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[2:01:51] that means he knows your every
[2:01:53] Temptation he knows every weakness he
[2:01:56] knows everything so what do you have to
[2:01:58] do 1 Peter 5:7 casting all you your care
[2:02:02] upon him for he carth for you
[2:02:05] right he wants to reveal hisself to
[2:02:09] us that's his
[2:02:12] desire you can read it for yourself John
[2:02:15] 15:16 John 15:1 15:16 you can read
[2:02:19] Revelation 20 3:20 said this behold
[2:02:21] stand at the door and knock that if any
[2:02:24] man hear my voice and open the door I
[2:02:26] want to come
[2:02:27] in I will I will come into him and will
[2:02:30] suff with him and he with me he want to
[2:02:32] have
[2:02:34] Fellowship the Bible also says draw nigh
[2:02:36] to God and He will draw an nigh to
[2:02:38] you James
[2:02:42] 4:8 remember brother and sister our God
[2:02:45] is a way
[2:02:47] maker he can
[2:02:50] create not only he but his power is is
[2:02:53] lying in our hearts brother Bram said
[2:02:55] God has given us enough power
[2:02:58] today we are not lacking power but we
[2:03:00] are lacking Faith to use that power he
[2:03:03] said he has given so much power you can
[2:03:05] speak a word and create a world and step
[2:03:07] into there and live there
[2:03:11] yes think about
[2:03:13] it he wants to
[2:03:15] reveal to us because he's our
[2:03:19] maker isn't it wonderful brother sister
[2:03:26] I will close with
[2:03:30] this for the Lord is good his Mercy is
[2:03:33] Everlasting and his truth endureth to
[2:03:35] all generation Psalm 100 verse five I'm
[2:03:39] closing with this remember brothers
[2:03:41] sisters you are the Masterpiece of
[2:03:44] God you are the apple of his
[2:03:47] eye you're are fearfully and wonderfully

[2:04:18] strong in the power of God don't you
[2:04:21] ever look look at the
[2:04:22] situation just like Peter did when he
[2:04:25] begin to hear those boies you know wi
[2:04:29] when he saw and he begin to sink as far
[2:04:32] as his eyes was on Jesus he kept walking
[2:04:34] on the water we'll keep walking until we
[2:04:38] look at this boisterous winds and we'll
[2:04:41] thinkink it's a great harm to our lives
[2:04:43] our families and our church so let's

[2:05:22] this is just part one so whenever you
[2:05:24] come you can continue and pre and preach
[2:05:27] part
[2:05:41] two we' been having some wonderful
[2:05:43] Fellowship you know we were down in
[2:05:45] North Carolina having a meeting he was
[2:05:47] there with his brother and another
[2:05:49] brother chamson from uh IND India also
[2:05:53] so uh uh uh you know brother Tim was
[2:05:57] calling our attention so he says who are
[2:06:00] you coming with I say I'm coming with
[2:06:02] the three wise men from the
[2:06:03] [Laughter]
[2:06:05] [Music]
[2:06:07] East so I had to use that to remind him
[2:06:10] when we met I said you remember the
[2:06:12] brother that said the three coming with
[2:06:13] the three wise men from the East so uh
[2:06:17] praise the Lord but I we are very
[2:06:20] grateful tonight amen amen we can say we
[2:06:22] are very grateful for the word of the
[2:06:24] Lord amen praise the Lord you know just
[2:06:26] like I said on
[2:06:28] Sunday the greatest thing that we have
[2:06:30] to deal with in this life is our
[2:06:34] spirit our spirit has been so messed
[2:06:39] up with everything that we have gone
[2:06:42] through in this life you know I was
[2:06:44] talking
[2:06:46] about uh shame on on uh Sunday when we
[2:06:51] get down and and and start to look in
[2:06:54] that subject you'll realize
[2:07:01] that even the little
[2:07:04] child when a little
[2:07:06] child is being shamed in the wrong way
[2:07:10] it affects their Spirits so
[2:07:13] much it affects their spirit so
[2:07:18] much that if God don't help that child
[2:07:22] you see it's all of these things that
[2:07:24] make us to underestimate God it's not
[2:07:28] that we don't believe the word we read
[2:07:30] it but why are we not Rising why are we
[2:07:34] not rising to the
[2:07:36] occasion why are we not rising to the
[2:07:38] place to apply the
[2:07:40] word because there is there is this fear
[2:07:43] that lies in our
[2:07:46] spirit we don't want to make mistake we
[2:07:48] don't want to say the wrong thing we
[2:07:51] don't want to be
[2:07:54] wrong so because of that we don't even
[2:07:56] give a chance to
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:08:01] try we want it to be right we don't give
[2:08:04] ourself a
[2:08:06] chance and with that kind of attitude
[2:08:09] you are underestimating
[2:08:12] God you are underestimating God you are
[2:08:16] not believing his
[2:08:19] word why because you are TR trying to
[2:08:22] make yourself perfect you are trying to
