[19:36] the community service tonight,
[19:39] I want to I just want to go over
[19:41] something that I've I've spoken on here

[19:46] you. Um
[19:50] we not have much of a co projected
[19:52] tonight. We'll just read u scripture and
[19:55] few things that brother B said here just
[19:58] to be able to encourage ourself. Praise
[20:00] the Lord. Let's stand on our feet
[20:04] and we read from uh
[20:11] Hebrew chapter 12.
[20:16] Let's read from Hebrew chapter 12
[20:18] tonight.
[20:45] Hebrews chapter 12. Let's read from
[20:47] verse 22.
[20:57] But yeah, I come unto man Mount man
[20:59] Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man
[20:59] Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man
[20:59] Mount man Zion and onto the city of the
[21:03] living God,
[21:05] the heavenly Jerusalem
[21:07] and to an innumerable company of angels
[21:11] to the general assembly and the church
[21:14] of the firstborn which are written in
[21:17] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[21:21] to the spirit of just man made perfect.
[21:25] and to Jesus the mediator of the new
[21:29] covenant and to the blood
[21:33] of sprinkling
[21:36] that speaketh better things than that of
[21:39] Abel. Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just uh
[21:45] thank you oh God for this portion of
[21:47] your word that we have read. We pray oh
[21:49] father that you would just put blessing
[21:51] upon it now. We love you and we
[21:54] appreciate you in Jesus name we pray.
[21:57] Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[21:59] your seat.
[22:01] Paul is speaking here that that uh we
[22:03] have come onto Mount Zion, the city of
[22:05] the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem
[22:08] and innumerable company of angels. We
[22:12] have come to the general assembly that
[22:14] is the mystical body. the general
[22:17] assembly and the church of the firstborn
[22:20] which are written in heaven and to the
[22:22] jo the and to the God
[22:26] and to God the j of all and the spirit
[22:30] of just men be perfect. Praise the Lord.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. My tongue is beginning to stick at
[22:35] the roof of my mouth. Amen. And to Jesus
[22:39] the mediator of the new covenant and to
[22:42] the blood of sprinkling. That's what I
[22:45] want to talk on a little bit tonight
[22:47] just before we pray the blood of
[22:49] sprinkling. But before then, I also want
[22:51] to I want for us to just do a little
[22:53] review here.
[22:55] And uh the blood of sprinkling that
[22:58] speaketh better things than that of
[23:00] Abel. So like I said this morning,
[23:03] Hebrew is uh is a promise uh uh book.
[23:08] It's a promise book. It's a book of
[23:11] better things. Let's look at it that
[23:13] way. Amen. Because right in the book of
[23:15] Hebrew, there's there's a whole lot of
[23:17] promise there where God uh uh uh I mean
[23:20] Paul speaking to the church, he speaks
[23:23] of uh of better things.
[23:26] And I want to like I said I'll do a
[23:28] little review. Let's go back uh to
[23:31] Hebrew chapter 1. We will just uh go
[23:34] through few verses here and just and
[23:36] just look at some of the things that
[23:39] Paul speaks about. Hebrews chapter 1
[23:42] let's look at verse 4.
[23:47] Hebrew chapter 1 verse4. So you will see
[23:49] that from Hebrew chapter 1, chapter 2,
[23:54] chapter 3 up to chapter 5, Paul is uh uh
[24:07] Hebrew chapter.
[24:10] Hebrew chapter one. Oh, found myself in
[24:14] the
[24:16] book.
[24:18] Hebrews chapter 1 verse4. So you see
[24:20] right here Paul
[24:23] speaks here
[24:26] talking about Jesus from verse three who
[24:30] being the brightness of his glory in the
[24:33] express image of his person
[24:37] and upholding all things by the word of
[24:40] his power. When he h when he have by
[24:43] himself porch, I was saying sat down on
[24:46] the right hand of the majestic on high
[24:49] being made so much better than
[24:54] the angels. Praise the Lord.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; As he have
[25:01] by inheritance or fain a more excellent
[25:04] name than they. So you will see how the
[25:08] the uh the apostle Paul he's trying to
[25:11] bring to to his Jewish brothers uh and
[25:15] and to to make them to understand that
[25:17] this Jesus that we crucify
[25:21] and uh uh uh if you look over in the
[25:25] Torah or you look over in the book of
[25:27] Moses, you will realize that uh Moses
[25:31] spoke of him and everything that was
[25:33] done in the tabernacle, everything of
[25:35] the prophet ETS was pointing to this
[25:38] Jesus. Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; If you know the difference between the
[25:44] the Pharisees and the and the Sadducees,
[25:47] you will know that the Sadducees do not
[25:49] believe in angels. The Sadducees do not
[25:52] believe in resurrection. And uh and and
[25:55] uh like like brother George Martins uh
[25:58] uh of blessed memory will say, he says
[26:00] that's the reason why they are side. You
[26:02] see,
[26:04] praise the Lord. Because they don't
[26:06] believe in angels. They don't believe in
[26:08] resurrection. Praise the Lord. But the
[26:10] Pharisees believe in angels. The
[26:12] Pharisees believe in resurrection. And
[26:14] and uh and to them, you know, angelic
[26:18] being angels were were were great thing
[26:22] because angels came to the prophets.
[26:25] Praise the Lord.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul is now trying to bring to
[26:29] them that this man Jesus, praise the
[26:33] Lord. Amen.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; He was the angel of the covenant.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; He's trying to make them to see how he
[26:43] was better than the angels.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's trying to he's trying to
[26:52] magnify the person of Jesus Christ to to
[26:55] uh to the to to the Jewish church or the
[26:58] Hebrew believers to make them to see
[27:00] that he was better than an angel. Let's
[27:03] go down to uh chapter 6.
[27:12] chapter 6 verse9 he picks up another
[27:15] better thing because if you look there
[27:17] he talks about the the the angels he
[27:20] talks about the priesthood in chapter
[27:22] four and five and and and and all of
[27:25] that but let's go to chapter six if you
[27:28] actually search it out in the book of
[27:29] Hebrew there are 13 better things 13
[27:32] better that uh Paul speaks about chapter
[27:35] 6 verse9 N
[27:43] But beloved, we are persuaded better
[27:46] things of you
[27:48] and things that accompany the salvation
[27:52] though we do speak. Praise the Lord.
[27:55] Amen. Encouraging the believers, he says
[27:58] that uh uh you know we are persuaded
[28:01] better things. Let's look at chapter 7
[28:04] verse 7.
[28:10] And we read from verse six. But he whose
[28:13] he who desend is not counted from them
[28:17] receive tithe of Abraham and bless him
[28:21] that had the promises.
[28:25] And without all contradiction, the less
[28:30] is bless.
[28:34] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Who was the better? Mechisedic was the
[28:39] better.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So Paul is now also
[28:44] bringing that uh uh the the the Levites
[28:48] were asked to receive tithe, but he's
[28:51] trying to tell the the Jewish church,
[28:54] let's go back to where it began from.
[28:57] Amen.
[28:58] that the less was blessed of the better
[29:02] because it actually started there in
[29:04] Genesis when uh uh when he came down
[29:07] Mechisedic came down to Abraham and then
[29:10] he bless him. When you go down you see
[29:12] how he's talking about the Mechisedic
[29:14] priesthood which of course he's trying
[29:16] to establish that that priesthood was a
[29:19] better priesthood than the Leviticus
[29:21] priesthood. Praise the Lord. So that is
[29:23] our uh another better uh chap uh verse
[29:27] 19
[29:30] verse 19 chapter 7
[29:38] verse 19 reads for the Lord made nothing
[29:42] perfect
[29:44] but the bringing in of a better hope.
[29:49] Praise the Lord. So he's he's he's
[29:52] trying to emphasize Moses gave us the
[29:54] law. He came down from the mountain with
[29:56] with the tablets in his hands. But those
[29:59] commandment those h commandment laws
[30:02] that was given to him, it made nothing
[30:05] perfect, but all it did was just to give
[30:08] us a better expectation.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can look forward to
[30:13] something better coming.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. chapter uh verse 22
[30:23] in the same chapter 7.
[30:28] The Lord be nothing perfect at verse 19
[30:30] but but but the bringing in of a better
[30:33] hope by which we draw nigh unto God.
[30:38] Verse 22.
[30:47] But so much was Jesus made a assurityity
[30:51] of a better testament.
[30:55] Are we together?
[30:57] &gt;&gt; We are having a better hope. We have a
[31:01] better testament. We are persuaded of
[31:04] better things. Praise the Lord.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; And he's better than the angels.
[31:17] Let's look at chapter 8 verse 6.
[31:21] I'll get out of my bed here soon.
[31:43] If we read from verse 5, chapter 8 verse
[31:45] 5 and six, who unto the example and
[31:49] shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was
[31:53] uh admonished of God, when he was about
[31:56] to make the tabernacle,
[31:59] for seeth he that thou make it all
[32:03] things according to the pattern show
[32:05] thee in the mountain. Verse six, but now
[32:10] have he orain a more excellent ministry.
[32:13] Talking about Jesus,
[32:17] but how much also he is the mediator of
[32:22] a better covenant.
[32:25] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Moses came down uh uh from the mountain
[32:30] with the tablets in his hands. He came
[32:33] down with the commandment of God and and
[32:36] he and and and he and he told the people
[32:39] that God show him, you know, the pattern
[32:41] of this tabernacle that was going to be
[32:43] built. But yeah, Paul now is taking it
[32:46] much farther as he talks about Jesus. He
[32:49] said, but but now he have obtained a
[32:52] more excellent ministry than than that
[32:55] of Moses.
[32:56] But how much he how much also he is a
[33:01] mediator of a better covenant which also
[33:05] establish upon better promises.
[33:10] It it can just be better for a child of
[33:13] God. It can just be better.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; It can never go back. It can never get
[33:18] worse. Your trials is just to make you
[33:21] better.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says and even our
[33:26] Lord Jesus says if if we as a parents
[33:30] know how to give good gift to our
[33:32] children how much more about the
[33:34] heavenly father he just don't give us
[33:36] good gift he give us better gift
[33:39] &gt;&gt; amen
[33:40] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[33:41] &gt;&gt; oh I love the lord amen
[33:43] &gt;&gt; I just love it we have a better covenant
[33:46] and we get better promises because our
[33:49] promises is the duration of our promises
[33:52] are not only for this life. Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; It is also for the life to come.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Better confident, better promises. Let's
[34:01] look in chapter nine, verse 23.
[34:07] I hope you're having a good time like
[34:09] I'm doing. Amen.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; I love this. Uh uh the book of Hebrew is
[34:13] is a is a special book to me and I I
[34:16] like it. Amen.
[34:20] Chapter 9 verse uh 23.
[34:27] It was therefore necessary
[34:30] that the pattern of things in the heaven
[34:35] should be purified with these.
[34:40] But the heavenly things themselves with
[34:43] better sacrifices than these. Now, what
[34:47] Paul is talking about here is that God
[34:50] gave Moses a pattern to build a
[34:53] tabernacle and all the things in the
[34:55] tabernacle,
[34:57] it was it was was given to Moses in a
[34:59] vision, he was instructed where to place
[35:02] them, everything. But the Bible tells us
[35:05] that every time every time a sacrifice
[35:08] was made and and the high priest would
[35:10] made a sacrifice for himself and a
[35:13] sacrifice for the people, he would take
[35:15] the blood the water of separation mixed
[35:18] with hassel. After he sprinkle it on the
[35:21] people, he will also have to sprinkle
[35:23] it, which mean he will have to sanctify
[35:26] the entire tabernacle and the people
[35:29] wave the water of separation. Praise the
[35:32] Lord.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Every sacrifice it was a repeated thing.
[35:36] So what what Paul is now saying over to
[35:38] the to the Jewish brothers here and here
[35:41] is it now we have a better sacrifice.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Not the sacrifice of bulls and goats. We
[35:49] have a better sacrifice and which of
[35:52] course it makes the preaching of the
[35:55] word the sprinkling of the blood. Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Now we are not mixing you know a lamb
[36:01] blood with house sap and arches from the
[36:04] sacrifice to sprinkle it upon the people
[36:07] but we are sprinkling the promises of
[36:09] God. Amen. When the word is preached.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have a better sacrifice.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10.
[36:24] We are closing up here.
[36:26] You know the beautiful thing about this.
[36:28] I was I was just in the office going
[36:30] over there again and I was counting my
[36:32] better
[36:34] like you know we we love to do and uh uh
[36:38] you count the better actually they are
[36:40] 13. Praise the Lord.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; And 13 is the number of the church.
[36:45] Amen. It's the number of the woman. So
[36:47] Christ is going to get a better bride.
[36:49] Amen.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a better church.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:56] Hebrews chapter 10:34.
[37:04] Verse
[37:11] 34. For years
[37:14] had compassion of men abound and took
[37:18] joyfully the spoils of your ghost,
[37:22] knowing in yourself that ye have in
[37:27] heaven a better and an enduring
[37:32] substance. Praise the Lord.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; So he's saying there are better things
[37:37] that is waiting for us on the other
[37:38] side.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; As we gave our time, we gave our
[37:44] services to the Lord, we gave our
[37:46] substance to the Lord, there are better
[37:48] things that are waiting for us on the
[37:49] other side.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews chapter 11,
[37:55] that's the fifth chapter.
[37:58] Praise the Lord.
[38:01] Let's read these three and then we will
[38:03] close here and then just look into what
[38:06] we want to share with you tonight.
[38:09] 11 verse 16.
[38:24] Let's go back to verse 17 a little bit.
[38:26] It give us a good picture here. Verse
[38:29] 14. For they that say such things
[38:32] declare plainly that they seek a city.
[38:36] And truly, if they have been mindful of
[38:40] that country from whence they came out,
[38:44] they might they might have had an
[38:46] opportunity to have returned.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; But now they desire a better country.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was Abraham looking for that
[38:57] that uh a city who maker and beta is
[39:00] gone because we know that all of these
[39:02] country are going to die. Everything is
[39:05] going to perish. Everything is going to
[39:07] be dissolved. We are looking for a
[39:09] better country.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; With a better government. Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; For now they desire a better country
[39:20] that is unheaven. Wherefore God is not
[39:24] ashamed to be called their God.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; For he have prepared for them a city.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Every country has a capital city. Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; So our better city has a better capital.
[39:38] Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; The word of God is just so wonderful.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at verse 14.
[39:58] Oh, I love this.
[40:02] We read this this morning.
[40:06] Verse 39. And these all having obtained
[40:09] a good report through faith received not
[40:12] the promise. God having provided some
[40:16] better things for us that they without
[40:20] us should be made perfect.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; We can read about the characters in the
[40:26] Bible. You read about Samson. You read
[40:29] about David. you know, you read about
[40:32] Abigail and uh and and you know, and and
[40:35] and sometimes you you know, there
[40:38] there's a sense of spiritual jealousy. I
[40:40] wish my name was in the Bible. Amen. I
[40:43] wish my art was uh recorded. But you see
[40:46] uh uh uh just like what Paul is trying
[40:49] to bring to his brothers to see, you
[40:51] know, all of those people with all of
[40:54] the good report and all of their good
[40:56] testimony that he had, they did not
[40:59] receive the promise.
[41:02] Praise the Lord.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the promise? Christ in
[41:06] you.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; They were led by inspiration.
[41:14] They were inspired to do what they did.
[41:16] They were inspired to to pray like David
[41:18] in the psalm. They were inspired to sing
[41:20] songs. But now we have the promise.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; We have better think
[41:27] &gt;&gt; which is Christ in you. Greater is he
[41:30] that is in you.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; He that is in the word.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:40] So we might sometimes we you know you
[41:43] you think about the the the three Hebrew
[41:45] boy going in the fire. Think about what
[41:48] we have to deal with in our age.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we will be in
[41:54] sin.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean we will be in
[41:58] sin. We will be piercing our ears and
[42:00] hanging our pains down and and and maybe
[42:03] drunk on the street also. But God God
[42:07] has possessed our body. Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; We might be dealing with one thing or
[42:14] another, but we have a better hope.
[42:17] Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Whatever we have in us is better. That
[42:22] uh that uh uh they without us are not
[42:26] made perfect. We have to be here. We
[42:28] have to come.
[42:30] There's uh chapter 10 verse 40 and uh
[42:35] chapter 12 verse
[42:38] 24.
[42:40] That's what we read as our opening
[42:43] scripture. But let's read that again.
[42:45] Chapter 12 verse 24. We go back again to
[42:51] verse 22. But yeah, I come onto Mount
[42:54] Zion and onto the city of the living
[42:56] God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
[43:00] innumerable company of angels. Can you
[43:03] imagine Jesus there in Gethsemane? He
[43:06] said, "I can ask the father to send me
[43:08] legions of angels, but you have it."
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul is saying here.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; He gave his angels charge over us.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; That's the company. Brother Brandham
[43:25] will say in a message
[43:28] uh uh revelation is uh uh
[43:32] what symbols.
[43:36] How did he title that?
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Revelation the book of symbols. You will
[43:41] see that uh he has make us uh angelic
[43:45] association.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; He has brought us in the company of
[43:48] angels.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says once in a while when you
[43:54] feel the joy of the Lord you just bump
[43:56] into angels.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Those things sound common to us. They
[44:00] are reality.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine on that mountain and
[44:04] Elijah is telling his seven boy don't
[44:06] worry.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; There is more with us than they that are
[44:09] against us.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; But the young man was so terrified.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; He believed his pastor but he was so
[44:18] terrified. Are you sure?
[44:21] Are you sure? God. Elijah said, "Lord,
[44:24] just give him a vision."
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; And God just opened the corner of his
[44:31] eyes and he saw the angels
[44:34] &gt;&gt; all over. And Paul is saying, "We are
[44:36] right in the company of them."
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Then what are you afraid?
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Why are you afraid? Why can't you hold
[44:43] God's word?
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:49] Are we together? Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; To the general assembly, the church of
[44:57] the firstborn, which which are raised in
[44:59] heaven,
[45:01] and to God the judge of all, and to the
[45:05] spirit of just just men made perfect.
[45:08] and to Jesus the mediator of the new
[45:12] covenant
[45:14] and to the blood of sprinkling
[45:18] that speaketh better things.
[45:21] Praise the Lord.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; That's the last of the better. Paul is
[45:26] talking about the blood that speaketh
[45:28] better things
[45:30] &gt;&gt; than the blood of Abel.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. the blood that speaketh better
[45:38] things and I believe that uh uh uh let's
[45:42] let's go to the book of uh Genesis here
[45:45] I should take just few minutes here when
[45:48] I get excited then I'm taking more time
[45:50] amen
[45:53] I should not be a side I should just be
[45:55] myself amen
[45:58] I should just
[46:02] praise the Lord
[46:05] You love the Lord.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I sure you do.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; I'm very well sure you do. Let's Let's
[46:11] look down here. Genesis chapter 3.
[46:18] Genesis chapter 3. I thought about this
[46:20] the other day. You know, this morning we
[46:23] read where Jesus says, uh, you know,
[46:26] don't rejoice in all these things.
[46:27] Rejoice because your name is on the book
[46:30] of life. That's something we have we
[46:32] have preached before.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; And John the Revelator was in that
[46:37] group. When Jesus was saying, "Rejoice
[46:40] because your name was in the book of
[46:41] life." It was not real to him.
[46:45] It was sounding. It just went over his
[46:47] head.
[46:49] Revelation chapter 5, that's when what
[46:52] Jesus said became real to him
[46:56] &gt;&gt; because he saw his name on the book.
[47:00] Are we together?
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's let's watch this one.
[47:05] That's what tonight I want to I want to
[47:07] see with your faith before we pray.
[47:10] Verse 20.
[47:12] Revelation 3:20. And Adam called
[47:16] his wife named Eve, because she was the
[47:19] mother of all living.
[47:22] Unto Adam also and to his wife did the
[47:26] Lord God make coats of skin and clothe
[47:30] him.
[47:31] Praise the Lord.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham would let us to
[47:38] know which of course if God took clothes
[47:41] of skin and and and uh uh uh you know he
[47:45] if he took coat of skin and clothed them
[47:48] then which mean God killed Elam? Are we
[47:51] together?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Then which mean God kill a lamb on the
[47:56] east side of Eden. And he has to take
[47:58] the skin to dress his son and his
[48:00] daughter. Take off their their fake leaf
[48:03] apron that is sold for themselves and
[48:06] dress them in bleeding skin.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; The same way that we are dressed in the
[48:12] bleeding word.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Now, but this is where I want us to
[48:19] come. Paul is speaking about the blood
[48:21] that speak better things than the blood
[48:23] of Abbe. Now, but uh before Abel blood
[48:26] will speak, we realize that Abel uh King
[48:30] and Abel went down here to church and
[48:32] they were they were you know trying to
[48:33] bring some worship to the Lord and bring
[48:36] sacrifices to the Lord. Now Paul in the
[48:39] same book of Hebrew would tell us in
[48:41] Hebrew 11 that Abel by faith.
[48:46] Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Abel by faith offer a more excellent
[48:50] sacrifice.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Now many times I've been there before
[48:56] where sometimes and many times uh uh uh
[49:00] uh that scripture
[49:03] looks like something just struck a from
[49:06] the blue.
[49:08] Okay. Something just just reveal open to
[49:12] a eyes that uh oh it's is it was blood
[49:17] or blood is the right sacrifice or
[49:19] animal was killed or blood that was
[49:21] shared in the garden of Eden. But what I
[49:24] want to bring to your mind tonight is
[49:26] that uh I believe that God can give
[49:30] revelation because I mean we sitting
[49:33] down on a h a message that uh God has
[49:37] given many revelation to the prophet of
[49:39] the hour.
[49:41] But just like how Paul will says that
[49:43] faith cometh by hearing.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; And hearing of the word of God.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Now let me take you through a little
[49:51] drama here. Imagine
[49:54] Adam and Eve and and and Cain and Abel
[49:58] asking their parents, "How was it in
[50:00] Eden?"
[50:02] You talk about Ed. How was it in Eden?
[50:06] And uh and Adam is explaining how he why
[50:11] he gave the name to the lions and why he
[50:14] gave this animal the name. He says, "You
[50:16] see that hill there? It used to be down
[50:18] there, but I thought we needed a valley
[50:21] there. So I put it on this side and and
[50:24] and and and the boys start asking but
[50:28] why are we not having this?
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing happened to us as
[50:35] uh as parents when you telling your
[50:38] children when we came to the Lord and
[50:40] when we came to the message how it used
[50:42] to be and uh you know and and and the
[50:44] things that we experience and and the
[50:46] move of God. We used to go to
[50:48] convention. We used to go to services
[50:50] here and all of that and they are now
[50:53] looking at the present day this church
[50:56] and I says
[50:58] why is it different?
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[51:05] Then I believe that uh uh uh uh uh Adam
[51:09] and Eve had to tell them the why.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; How we got here. Like your child will
[51:18] ask you a question. Uh h who made a car?
[51:22] Okay. Before men started driving car,
[51:24] how were they how are they traveling?
[51:27] Now this it's it's more question now for
[51:30] you to start going back and start
[51:32] explaining how we used to walk from one
[51:34] town to another and and you know and
[51:37] then you get into the countdown and
[51:38] explain from Henburgie to uh to uh uh uh
[51:42] cod and and then you can explain all of
[51:44] that. But think about it this way. Think
[51:47] about it this way that that that that uh
[51:50] uh uh King and Abel, they are sitting
[51:52] right there and and their parents are
[51:55] testifying until they came down to the
[51:58] place of where
[52:00] Eve said that she listened to the
[52:02] serpent.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And think about it. And daddy, what did
[52:13] you do?
[52:15] question to Adam. When mama did that,
[52:18] what did you do? Praise the Lord.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; And Adam saying, I look right in the
[52:26] eyes of your mother.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; I knew if I reject her, I will have to
[52:33] be alone.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Because Adam never had no second choice.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We get a lot of choices
[52:40] around us. That's why sometimes people
[52:42] are stupid.
[52:47] And I realized I knew what it was
[52:51] when I was all alone.
[52:56] And I love mama so much
[53:02] that I just couldn't allow her to
[53:07] to go into God's wrath and identify
[53:10] myself with her.
[53:13] Praise the Lord.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; And what happened?
[53:17] Adam saying, "For the first time,
[53:21] I saw the animals running after one
[53:23] another.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; For the first time, I lose control.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; I couldn't say stop. They won't stop."
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And then what happened?
[53:38] What's about the evening time?
[53:41] You remember when you used you talk
[53:42] about God coming down in the evening
[53:44] time.
[53:46] What happened that evening?
[53:49] Says, "Oh boy,
[53:53] I heard his voice.
[53:56] Praise the Lord.
[53:59] I heard his voice
[54:01] and I hid myself."
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Now he's telling, you know, all of this
[54:09] now to to to his sons
[54:13] and we got ourselves some fake leaf and
[54:16] and everything and but yet God came so
[54:20] close and he kept calling.
[54:23] He knew exactly where we are. I think we
[54:26] never knew where we were but God knew
[54:28] where we are. Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; So God calling Adam, it was not because
[54:32] that he didn't know where Adam was. It
[54:34] was all because Adam did not know where
[54:36] he was because he was out of his
[54:38] position. He was out of his place.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; But then when he came around
[54:53] the first time I would see blood,
[55:01] I saw a skin dress
[55:06] maybe hanging on a tree.
[55:10] and fresh blood was dropping from that
[55:14] and he told us to take off our our
[55:17] leaves and go and wear those skin. Now
[55:21] think about it now. He's he's he's
[55:23] testifying. He's saying the word ether
[55:26] by faith and faith cometh by the word.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; It was not a vague thing.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see when you hear the word and
[55:38] the word being preached to you and you
[55:39] are reading the word
[55:41] &gt;&gt; your faith generates
[55:43] &gt;&gt; from what you have heard
[55:45] &gt;&gt; your faith in believing God generates
[55:48] from what you have been reading
[55:50] &gt;&gt; it was not a big thing that just dropped
[55:52] in Abel's mind
[55:54] &gt;&gt; it was from what he heard amen
[55:57] &gt;&gt; because we have a record here
[56:00] &gt;&gt; that God slay the lamb
[56:02] &gt;&gt; and he dressed him in his Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; And Adam saying all of this to the boys
[56:13] and every time when we walk out of his
[56:15] presence brought them over to to uh uh
[56:18] uh Genesis 3:15, we heard God saying
[56:22] the seed of the woman will bruise the
[56:25] head of the serpent and all of that. And
[56:28] he asked them to go and and and and and
[56:31] Adam talking about every time you know
[56:34] they would take a step they would see
[56:36] the blood constantly dropping
[56:39] &gt;&gt; from the skin.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; You know brother Brandham called that
[56:45] constant atuming.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; That's what we have when you walk in the
[56:50] light
[56:51] &gt;&gt; as he is in the light.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; That's that's your that's your bloody
[56:58] skin that you are dressed in.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; You have a constant atonement.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; As you walk in the light as he is in the
[57:04] light.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; So we have a constant atonement.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; So that's what I wanted to bring to you
[57:13] tonight. That in their faith that Paul
[57:17] testify of was just not an imagination.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; It was a faith that was generated.
[57:26] from what he heard
[57:27] &gt;&gt; because that is the same thing to the
[57:29] believer.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Service is over. They gone home and
[57:38] everybody went to their place and
[57:40] everything and and and and over and over
[57:43] and over
[57:45] this shepherd board is thinking in his
[57:47] mind, I I can't imagine it.
[57:52] Kill one of my sheep.
[57:54] God killed a sheep.
[57:57] Oh my, that's terrifying.
[58:00] But the word talks to his mind.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; He's thinking about it.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; As horrible as it may seem, sometimes
[58:09] the preacher preaches and it looks like
[58:11] he's blasting and it looks like I mean
[58:14] he he's sounding angry and sometimes
[58:17] something sticks on your mind. Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mind do not accept it in
[58:24] the first. Why? Why did he say that?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; But God will use that thing
[58:30] &gt;&gt; and keep turning it around your mind and
[58:33] every time you meditate on it,
[58:35] &gt;&gt; faith is being generated.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Every time you think about it, you
[58:42] meditate upon it, faith is being
[58:43] generated.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Just waiting for the time to get into
[58:47] action. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; As much as I will have think that oh it
[58:55] was a horrible thing that they killed an
[58:57] animal. Why would they kill an animal
[58:58] for what you did daddy? As much as he
[59:02] think that it was a horrible thing
[59:04] &gt;&gt; when he was faced with the choice of
[59:06] bringing a sacrifice.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has generated so much faith
[59:15] that he had to do the same thing that
[59:17] God did.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Because he had generated so much faith
[59:27] from that word that he heard
[59:29] &gt;&gt; that an animal was killed in the east
[59:32] side and my parents were dressed in the
[59:34] blood. It was horrible. It was
[59:36] terrifying. But as time goes by,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; that word starts to generate faith in
[59:42] your heart.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam said, "If you don't
[59:47] understand it, pray about it."
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just prayed about it. Don't reason
[59:51] it out. Don't make an interpretation.
[59:54] Just say, "Lord, I don't understand this
[59:55] thing." Amen. And you just prayed about
[59:57] it and God will start, you will realize
[1:00:00] that that thing will start haunting your
[1:00:02] mind. I wonder why did the Bible say
[1:00:04] that?
[1:00:05] I wonder why did the preacher say that?
[1:00:08] But that's God's way of generating
[1:00:10] faith.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; He start generating faith in you. And
[1:00:15] that's the way that Abel brought a more
[1:00:18] excellent sacrifice to God. It was not
[1:00:21] from an imagination or a vague
[1:00:23] revelation. It was from a word that was
[1:00:26] given to him. A word that was preached.
[1:00:28] Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God will say he would
[1:00:39] die on the very same altar of his
[1:00:41] sacrifice.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[1:00:47] if uh you know we turn to think that it
[1:00:50] means the same place. No,
[1:00:53] you will die for what you believe.
[1:00:56] You die for what you hold to obeying the
[1:00:59] truth.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not facing a fiery squad.
[1:01:04] It's it might not be going to prison.
[1:01:06] But it's because you hold dear to your
[1:01:09] heart. Hold dear in your heart what you
[1:01:13] believe that God were said by his tribe
[1:01:16] I'm healed.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You hold that dear in your heart. You
[1:01:19] believe that God word says uh uh uh uh
[1:01:22] he have blessed us with all spiritual
[1:01:24] blessing.
[1:01:27] And you hold those things dear in your
[1:01:29] heart that God's word says I will be
[1:01:31] adopted. His word says if you are
[1:01:33] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ I will hold I I will receive the
[1:01:37] gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; And as a believer you hold that dear in
[1:01:42] your heart.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Even though things are happening around
[1:01:45] you, you are bing with it in your mind
[1:01:49] but you are holding what you believe in
[1:01:51] your heart. And if you should die, you
[1:01:53] will die on that altar. Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing.
[1:02:07] And there's a blood that speaketh better
[1:02:09] things
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; than the blood of Abel.
[1:02:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:16] And I believe that this evening
[1:02:19] that blood is speaking grace
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; and peace. is speaking mercy.
[1:02:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:27] It's speaking on our behalf. It's
[1:02:29] speaking so loud.
[1:02:32] Is re-echoring the promises from this
[1:02:34] book.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come
[1:02:41] while we just want to take their thought
[1:02:43] in prayer tonight.
[1:02:47] a blood that speaketh better things.
[1:02:52] So you we see right there in u in the
[1:02:56] book of Hebrew, you know, I' I've
[1:02:58] learned this
[1:03:01] every time uh the devil try to push you
[1:03:04] against the word, just tell him it can
[1:03:05] only get better.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; When I read the word, I only see better
[1:03:11] things.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; It can only get better.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You tell him boo devil, it can
[1:03:18] only get better.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Because that's what the word says.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:08:22] me true.
[1:08:29] While the music plays softly, let's bow
[1:08:31] our heads together tonight.
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:38] Think about it. There's a blood that is
[1:08:39] speaking better things tonight on your
[1:08:41] behalf.
[1:08:43] When Jesus resurrected and Mary saw him,
[1:08:47] he said, "Touch me not, I go to my
[1:08:51] father, your father."
[1:08:54] He was going to present the sacrifice.
[1:08:58] Brother Brandham said it stands as a
[1:09:00] memorial before God.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; A blood that's speaking healing for you
[1:09:05] tonight. A blood that's speaking
[1:09:07] deliverance. A blood that is speaking
[1:09:09] breakthrough. And whatever you need,
[1:09:11] that blood is speaking better things
[1:09:13] tonight. Not only good things, but
[1:09:16] better things. Better is is better than
[1:09:19] good.
[1:09:25] Better is reliable.
[1:09:31] Oh, thank you, sweet Jesus, tonight.
[1:09:34] Yes, Lord Father.
[1:09:36] Oh, let's just thank him tonight.
[1:09:39] Let's just thank him and just praise him
[1:09:41] tonight. Let's just pray in our own way
[1:09:45] and just give thanks to God. Oh, your
[1:09:48] grace and mercy, Jesus,
[1:09:52] it has brought me through.
[1:09:58] It has been your grace and mercy,
[1:10:00] Father.
[1:10:02] Lord, in the name of Jesus, we just want
[1:10:04] to thank you, Father, tonight, oh God.

[1:10:38] and mercy, Lord, has redeemed us, Lord.
[1:10:41] Your grace and mercy has cleansed us,

[1:11:03] praise, to you be the glory, to you be
[1:11:05] the honor. Father God, we just thank you
[1:11:08] Lord for giving us this moment, Lord.
[1:11:10] Father, we thank you, oh God. Lord, we
[1:11:13] can lift our hands to you. We can lift
[1:11:15] our hearts to you, Lord, and say,

[1:11:19] heaven and earth. Blessed be the name of
[1:11:21] our creator, God. You have given us a
[1:11:23] better covenant, Lord. You have given us
[1:11:26] a better promises, oh God. You have
[1:11:28] given us a better priesthood. Oh father

[1:11:36] Lord, we thank you tonight. We thank you
[1:11:39] tonight, oh God. We have a better hope.
[1:11:42] We have a better resurrection, Lord. We

[1:11:47] that's what you gave to us tonight. We
[1:11:49] thank you, Father. Lord, to you be the
[1:11:52] praise. To you be the glory. Oh, Father.
[1:11:56] Yes, Lord. Thy grace and mercy, Father
[1:12:00] God. Oh, we thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:04] We thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:06] We praise your name, oh God. Father, we
[1:12:09] thank you for this assembly, Lord. Grace
[1:12:11] and mercy is keeping us here, Lord.
[1:12:14] Grace and mercy has brought us this far,
[1:12:16] Lord. Grace and mercy will see us true,
[1:12:18] precious God. Oh, we just want to thank
[1:12:21] you tonight. We want to glorify your
[1:12:24] name tonight. We want to exalt you in

[1:12:38] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:41] Thank you, Lord God.
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:58] I can't even walk without you holding my
[1:13:00] hands.
[1:13:15] Let's pray together

[1:13:52] of Jesus Christ around the word as we
[1:13:55] unite our faith together tonight. And uh
[1:13:59] if God will place someone on your heart,
[1:14:02] someone's essentially

[1:22:58] 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:04] We'll read this tonight and you can stay
[1:23:07] in the comfort of your seat.
[1:23:10] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:23:13] which also I deliver unto you,
[1:23:17] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:23:19] which he was betrayed. That's reading
[1:23:22] from verse 23 1 Corinthian 11
[1:23:26] that the Lord Jesus the same night he
[1:23:28] was betrayed
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:32] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:23:34] bread. 24
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:38] And when he had given thanks he break it
[1:23:41] and said take eat
[1:23:43] this is my body
[1:23:46] which is broken for you.
[1:23:50] This do in remembrance of me.
[1:23:53] After the same manner also he took the
[1:23:55] cup when he have sed saying
[1:24:00] this cup is the new testament of my
[1:24:03] blood.
[1:24:05] This do ye as of as ye drink it in
[1:24:09] remembrance of me.
[1:24:13] For as often as ye eat this bread and
[1:24:16] drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's
[1:24:18] death till he comes.
[1:24:22] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:24:24] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:24:26] unwartiling shall be guilty of the body
[1:24:32] and the blood of the Lord.
[1:24:36] But let a man examine himself
[1:24:40] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:24:44] drink of the cup.
[1:24:48] This we have told you before
[1:24:52] that the worshippers were never under
[1:24:54] examination. It was the sacrifice.
[1:24:58] So when Paul speaks for us to examine
[1:25:01] ourself
[1:25:02] is to examine ourself in accordance to
[1:25:05] our sacrifice.
[1:25:07] Are you accepting your sacrifice?
[1:25:10] Are you counting your sacrifice better
[1:25:11] than you?
[1:25:15] Praise the Lord. Are you believing in
[1:25:17] your sacrifice?
[1:25:20] Is it sufficient for you?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:27] But let a man examine himself, and so
[1:25:29] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:25:32] that cup. For for he that eatth and
[1:25:34] drinketh and wallet, eat it and drink it
[1:25:36] damn nation to himself. Not discerning,
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:40] not discerning your body, but you are
[1:25:43] not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:52] St. John chapter 13.
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:08] So John chapter 13 we read from verse
[1:26:10] two. And supper being ended, the devil
[1:26:14] having put having now poured into the
[1:26:16] heart of Judas as Simon's son to betray
[1:26:19] him. Jesus knowing that the father
[1:26:24] have given all things into his hands and
[1:26:28] that he was come from God and went to
[1:26:31] God.
[1:26:33] He rises from supper and lay aside his
[1:26:36] garment
[1:26:38] and took a towel and g himself.
[1:26:42] After that, he pou water into a basin
[1:26:45] and begin
[1:26:49] and be to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:26:52] wet them with a towel wherewith he was
[1:26:54] gathered.
[1:26:56] Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter
[1:27:00] said unto him, Lord, does thou wash my
[1:27:02] feet? Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:27:07] "What I do, thou knowest, not now, but
[1:27:11] thou shall know hereafter."
[1:27:14] And Peter said unto him, "Thou shall
[1:27:16] never wash my feet." Jesus answered him,
[1:27:20] "If I wash that, thou has no part with
[1:27:23] me."
[1:27:25] Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not my
[1:27:28] feet on it, but also my hands and my
[1:27:31] head. Jesus said unto him, he he that is
[1:27:35] washed needeth not safe to wash his
[1:27:38] feet,
[1:27:40] but is clean everywhere, and ye are
[1:27:44] clean, but not all.
[1:27:46] For for he knew who will betray him.
[1:27:49] Therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.
[1:27:52] So after he has washed their feet and
[1:27:54] has taken his garment, and he was set
[1:27:57] down again, and he said unto them, "Know
[1:27:59] ye what I have done unto you. Ye call me
[1:28:02] master and lord, and ye said well, for
[1:28:06] so I am."
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:11] If I then your lord and master has
[1:28:13] watched your feet, you also ought to
[1:28:16] watch one another feet.
[1:28:19] For I have given an example
[1:28:22] that ye should do as I have done unto
[1:28:24] you.
[1:28:26] Verily I said unto you, the seven is not
[1:28:30] greater than his Lord, neither
[1:28:33] he that is sent greater than he that
[1:28:36] sent him. If he know these things, happy
[1:28:40] are ye if you do them.
[1:28:44] I will cling
[1:28:47] to the old rocketed cross.
[1:28:54] No endless change
[1:28:57] is some days for the craft.
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:05] Oh, so I cherish
[1:29:09] the old rocked cross.
[1:29:16] And to my trophies
[1:29:20] I last I lay down.
[1:29:27] I will cling
[1:29:30] to the old rocket
[1:29:34] wash.
[1:29:38] And there's exchange
[1:29:41] some days for the ground. Let's sing
[1:29:46] that one more time. Lord, so I cherish
[1:29:52] the old rock.
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:59] Till my trophies
[1:30:04] are last
[1:30:06] lay down.
[1:30:11] Oh, I will cling
[1:30:14] to the old rocked
[1:30:17] cross
[1:30:22] and exchange
[1:30:25] your pain
[1:30:27] for the Christ.
[1:30:31] Heavenly Father,

[1:30:36] Father, in the light of bread
[1:30:40] that was baked, Lord. Father God,
