[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] What caused this trouble? There was a mixed multitude went up with them. The supernatural had been done down in Egypt. And when the supernatural had been done, everybody flocked to it. And it caused the mixed multitude to go with them. unregenerated, unconverted hearts going up trying to impersonate the real believer. And it's been that in the days of Noah. It was in that in the days of Christ. It's prophesied in God's word for to be the same thing in this day. Um the supernatural has been done. And there's a mixed multitude drawn up unregenerated hearts not conditioned not keeping God's word but impersonating something. What happened to you Lutheran many years ago at the first reformation? You held the torch light of freedom in your hands. You were God's light. What happened to you? Because you read in the Bible, the just shall live by faith. And you organize yourself around that one scripture and become a bunch of isolationists. And God took the torch light out of your hand. That's true. The just shall live by faith by faith. But there's more scriptures than that. What happened to you Methodist in the days of John Wesley who had the great revival that saved England when Wesley and Asbury and many of them were over here in one of the greatest revivals that this nation ever knew. You have the torch light in your hand. But after the going of John Wesley, what taking place? You got a bunch of seminary students in there that organized a great group and you set your doctrine up on sanctification and denied it. Now, and God took the torch right out of your hand, right? And some little oneeyed negro man down in California received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God stuck the torch light in the hands of Pentecost. But what happened? You held the torch light in your hands. But the first thing you know, you went and made a little issue just like the rest of them did and settled down and God took the torch light out of your [Applause] hands. You started breaking up. First thing this God did was restore the gifts. He started on speaking in tongues and you did speak with tongues. Then you made it a doctrine initial evidence. No one could get the Holy Ghost without speaking in tongues and all spoke with tongues got the Holy Ghost. That's all right. But you made it a doctrine and God took the thing out of your hand. Along come the new issue, the wonders. They started baptizing in Jesus name. That was all right. That's in the Bible. But what happened? You made an issue out of it. And where are you at tonight? On the sidelines, too, because you didn't hold the torch like you organized and put a period after that and that settled it. God started a move of divine healing out of the interdenominationals. And what happened tonight, brother? They made an issue out of it. And now they built their ministry up on fantastics and it's got to a place where it's all kinds of sensations. I'm going over to the west coast. I hope it never hits Phoenix. But oh mercy, everything that you could think of in the almanac and not in God's Bible, all kinds of isms and fantastics and the Pentecostal move has become placed down on little isms and emotions and God will jerk the torch light off of divine healing for he can't place any real pain on Nothing's got no foundation. God's word is his foundation. My friends, no wonder Pentecostal people are losing out. You once waved the tar side a few years ago. But there's just two factions left. One of them has gone off to a big bunch of starch rituals. All you do is have a little like a Presbyterian go to the church and have to hurry home at night to stick your head in the television to see who loves sie. You know that child. And you got nothing but baseball playing soup suppers and everything else in your church. Do you know that's true? And God could never faith and place in that anything else but confusion. And the other side has went off on the deep end to a bunch of everything is addict fanatics radic everything else that they could find in the way of sensation emotions. If the devil can't get you to see a truth, he'll push you off on the deep end somewhere. Dr. Roy Weed, the state presenter of the Assemblies of God of Indiana, one of my bosom friends, a real church of our brother. And here not long ago, brother Weave was speaking and he knows that my position was stay in the middle of the road. Never go fanatic or never go for but stay with the pure unadulterated word of God and build upon that solid foundation and accept nothing less is confirmed in God's word and I throw in the middle of the road at a business fans convention recently. Brother Weed, I guess, not knowing I was there, he said, I heard brother Brandham say, "The middle of the road." He said, "Of course, you know that's not good ethics. A man that get in the middle of the road will get run over." I'd be in a few minutes the master said, "Brother Brandon, have you got a word to say?" I said, "I sure have." I said, "Brother, these brethren become so earthbound so they can never soar up to see thus sayeth the Lord." This road we're traveling is a oneway road. You don't come back on it. You either go on with God or off on the deep end, one side or the other. And the only way you can do it, brother, we don't need all this formal stuff that we have today. Neither do we need all this fanaticism we have today. There's too much of the real genuine Holy Spirit. The skies are loaded with it. And there's no need to take a substitute and try to get to heaven on some sensation when God's word tells you you can't do it. What's the use of accepting a substitute? Either by joining your church and putting your name on the book or going over here and getting into some kind of a stuff that you're going to have to jump up and down or or run from your hands or bloody faces or something. But that stuff is out of hell. It's not in God's word. You believe me to be a prophet of God, receive my word and stay away from such stuff. The Bible said it in the last days, the Antichrist would deceive the very elected possible. If you'd stood with me in the jungles of Africa and watched those heathens produce blood in their hand, pour it into a skull, and drank it, you'd know better. Certainly, you see stuff. I believe in signs and wonders, but they've got to be God's signs and wonders. [Music] At the junction of every time that I'm going to speak on in a few nights. Listen to this, brother. When all heaven opens up, all hell opens up with it. The Bible said in the last days that they say, "Lo, he's in the desert. Lo, he's here. Lo, he's there." All kinds of signs and wonders. Said, "Believe it not. For as the lightning cometh from the east, and shineth even to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be, and every eye shall see him, every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess. Certainly in the last days, this is to happen. children. The Bible says, "As Jamis and Jamus, the two-headed God of Egypt, withtood Moses, so will these resist the truth." Men of repbate mind concerning the truth. The truth is God's word. He said, "What is true? Sanctify them, Father, through the truth. Thy word is the truth. We don't need some bogus something when God got the real thing for us. We don't need I was speaking with a minister in Los Angeles a few months ago when there was something about bringing a little woman over from Egypt and any one with good common sense knows those Adonas. Well, we got them in our town. There's a little woman lived at Charleston who is a ranked sinner and a drunkard. She pours blood from her hands every month, every 28 days. When I was in the Vatican City in Rome, they've got dozens of them there. Certainly. And when this minister put out that the oil off that woman's hand would heal people, put it on their face, when the blood offer there would mean salvation to nations. I called the minister out and said, "Brother, dear, I love you, but you've built your ministry up on sensations, and it's got to come to not." I said, "If I could preach the gospel half as well as you could, I'd never mention such a thing." Right? I said, "Do you realize if that or that blood has one speck of virtue in it, what happened to the blood of Jesus Christ? It's taken away from Christ, which is Antichrist." Against it. If anything could come from you, it goes to show it's corporal. If blood could come from a vision, a drop in your hands, then that was a carpal body of Christ. and he's come. There might be vision, sure, but no literal thing. If a frog come out of you, it went in you, right? I'm not angry. I can't be be a servant of God. But what gets me is to see these things pushed down, children of God. Oh, what started any cult? It lost hungry children trying to find something to eat. And a few lazy bunch of preachers won't give them the gospel they'll eat out of a garbage [Applause] can. I lay it on to you preachers. Right. If you won't give the children the bread of life, they'll take some kind of a scum out of the garbage can and eat it. Right? There's no scripture for that. There's no such thing. Only the Bible's condemning it. Jesus does not appear with scars in his head. If he does, he's come and he has bowed their tongues confessed. But the Bible said they'd say, "Lo, he's in the desert around Phoenix or whatever it might be. But believe it not. Lo, he's in the secret place. Believe it not." The Bible said that in that day many will stand and say, "Lord, have not I done many things in your name? Have not I prophesied in your name? Have not I done mighty works in your name?" He said, "I will confess unto them. I never knew you. Depart from me, you are workers of iniquity." Brother, until something happened down in a man's heart, that has changed him. Oh, if I knew that praying for the sick had ever started and worked up to such as that, I'm sorry I ever mentioned it, but I know that there is a real spirit of God who heals the sick. And I know the devil's trying to make counterfeits everywhere. It only proves that there is a real one. And it doesn't come from oil from a human's body. Neither does it come from blood. Neither does it come from anything from a man. It's a finished work at Calvary. And your faith in that finished work. If every appropriation has been made at Calvary, if everything that God promised was finished at Calvary and it's a finished product, you don't need nothing else but faith to believe it. That's right. How true. Stay with his word. God said these things had happened. Here they are before us. We see them. We look at them. The other day before I left home to come to Phoenix, Arizona, I had 30 calls less than two hours from Atlanta, Georgia, Birmingham, Alabama, and many places. The minister saying, "Brother Brandon, that west coast dogma has struck this country. Leave Phoenix alone and come here, brother Brandham. Surely they'll hear you. If they don't, our churches is lost." I said, "Brother, I can't come. I promise go to Phoenix, but you as a man of God climb in a pull pit and take that word of God and my sheep hear my voice and a stranger there. That's right. Oh, little children, what's the matter? We go off on the deep ends. Let's stay in the word. We're going right on down into that this coming week. Now, the rest of the week, oh brother, isolate yourself to Christ. Stay with him. Don't you know the time is coming? The Bible said they will go from the east to the west, north and south trying to find the true word of God and fail to do it. Don't you realize we're in the last days? Don't you realize that these things are supposed to take place in the last days? We are here. God keeps his word. And the Bible said Revelations 21 that this antichrist move one place it said it would deceive the very elected if possible. What is the elected? There's a mixed multitude of Pentecost today as he was then. The supernatural has been done and there's a mixed multitude with it that'll drink in any kind of s That's right. Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." It's a mixed multitude. The Bible said these days would be here. And how it would be, and we're living to see it, it sure. I noticed back there when he said he would deceive the very elected if possible. Now before the world begins, Jesus Christ was a lamb slain before the world began. Do you believe that? All right. Then back in the beginning when God looked down and seen what was going to happen, he spoke of the slaying lamb. And God's word is always confirmed in heaven. And the lamb was stranded right there before the foundation of the world according to God's word. Is that right? But it never happened for 4,000 years. But it was the finished work back here. God said so. And the Bible said that you in this church tonight that's born again. how it's nice for the poor to say there's a new name that's written down in glory tonight. But the Bible said that everyone that was saved, their names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. When the lamb was slain, you was associated with it. Then what are you going to do about it? All that comes to me, no man can come except my father draws him. There's the elected from the beginning. The Bible said in Revelation 13, "And the Antichrist deceived all that dwell upon the earth, whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world." With those signs and wonders, oh, you are to walk with me to India. Watch there. You want to see oil and blood. Well, if you want to see him pull off his shoes and walk through hot fire, come right back out without a scorch on him. Seen a man take a sword, put it over his heart, and push it right down through his heart. And a doctor went the platform and do it and took a a water and poured it through this and it run out that side and come back and jumped up and down shouting in the school of prophets or the feast of the prophets in the Muhammad temple. a man sitting there working himself up saying, "Allah, all all and got into such emotion." So he cut tucked splinters and pushed them through their fingers, pull them out with no blood and one tuck a lance and started from his chin and run right up through his nose and come back and prove that I was God. Listen brother, you're never saved by any sign. You're never saved by any sensation. You're saved when you meet God's condition of his word. And nothing else are you saved by. That's right. God's word has made a way. You're not saved because you feel like you're saved. I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved. There's a lot of times I don't feel that way. But I'm saved because God gave the promise. I met God's conditions. And upon God's holy word, I can defeat Satan's seven days and a week and as many nights because it's God's word. He that heareth my word and believeth on him has sent me everlasting life and shall not come to judgment but pass from death to life. That's what the King of Kings said. You believe it? If you believe, not if you shop, not if you run. Them things are all right. But you're trying to base and make a doctrine out of it. And even on divine healing, you're making a doctrine. And divine healing is a minor. How can the church ever major on a minor? Ask that question and think it over. It's a mixed multitude. It's a multitude. That's the reason, friends. Let me tell you something. Two weeks ago, there's man sitting, you're looking at me right now was in the meeting and Lima, Ohio, where I had the Methodists, the Baptist, and the Presbyterian, and some Nazarines, Salvation Army, all sponsor my meeting in a great big auditorium. They're standing on the word and proving by the word of the Lord Jesus and the real gospel things that was to take place and night after night hundreds of them walked down to the altar giving their hearts to Christ upon not a sensation upon the war. Let me tell you something, brother. Now, I want you to listen quiet and as I close on this. I am firmly believing this and I say this not knowing whether I live to see daylight or not, but there is a supernatural has been done. That's true. But you're going wild with it. You're going on the deep end with it. The devil's pushing you off with it. You got come out of the Bible now. I believe in the supernatural. I believe in Jesus Christ. I believe he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And does the same thing that he did yesterday, and will forever. That's right. I believe that. But now [Music]
