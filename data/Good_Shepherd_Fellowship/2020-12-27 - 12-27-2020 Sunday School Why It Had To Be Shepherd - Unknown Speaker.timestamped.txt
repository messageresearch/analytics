[5:03] this speaks
[5:04] of true atonement coming
[5:08] for sickness and sin that
[5:11] staff itself had turned into a serpent
[5:15] before pharaoh and the same pharaoh
[5:18] tried to mimic
[5:20] by magicians and so
[5:23] does the modern pharaohs of today
[5:26] and make believers carnal impersonators
[5:29] of the message
[5:31] trying to mimic the same thing without
[5:33] knowing where it's coming from
[5:35] and throw it into some denominational
[5:37] something
[5:38] when it's just free from it as a aries
[5:41] from being pinned up
[5:44] sure but try to mimic it
[5:47] make a mimi but notice this same
[5:50] shepherd's staff eat up the other snails
[5:55] where was that snake's at they were rods
[5:58] on the floor and there's only one rod
[5:59] picked up
[6:01] both heavens and earth will pass away
[6:03] said jesus but my word shall not
[6:06] speaks of true atonement coming for sin
[6:09] also israel's future
[6:13] offered know how spoke of israel
[6:17] now in the future there they were
[6:19] offered
[6:20] deliverance from bondage of death
[6:24] by a prophet shepherd
[6:28] they were brought out of bondage by a
[6:31] prophet shepherd with the staff
[6:34] see it was speaking of israel's future
[6:37] delivered
[6:38] from death and hell by a shepherd
[6:42] prophet that we'll speak of
[6:45] now to all that all
[6:48] as we know israel did not receive
[6:52] the prophet's shepherd's word all of
[6:55] israel didn't receive it
[6:57] now notice they was complaining
[7:01] oh when he was performing the miracle
[7:03] she was a great fellow
[7:05] but when he come to his message that was
[7:08] different
[7:09] all great signs follows a new message
[7:11] coming
[7:12] we know that in the wilderness they
[7:15] complained in the wilderness and
[7:17] died by the thousands frankly there was
[7:19] only two of them that ever went through
[7:21] that was saved out of a
[7:22] mid two and a half million two
[7:25] out of two and a half million you say
[7:28] that
[7:28] what happened to them they are eternally
[7:30] gone
[7:32] all of them brother branham jesus said
[7:34] so they said our fathers eat man in the
[7:36] wilderness
[7:38] and they drank from the rock and he's
[7:39] jesus said and there are
[7:41] every one dead eternally separated
[7:44] see everyone notice
[7:48] they complained about god's provided way
[7:51] was the reason they died i closely don't
[7:54] miss these last few remarks
[7:57] they complain what made them die in the
[7:59] wilderness
[8:00] they complained about god's provided way
[8:02] by a
[8:03] one-man message a prophet
[8:06] a leadership of one man tell me when god
[8:10] ever used a group to leave
[8:15] you won't find it in the bible one man
[8:19] they the word came to moses cora
[8:23] we all know that um he uh
[8:27] he got himself together and complained
[8:29] about god
[8:31] not being just to do a thing like that
[8:33] to make one man with a message he said
[8:35] we're all holy
[8:37] why can't we have a denomination and why
[8:39] can't we have set up this and do this
[8:41] and do that
[8:42] god told moses separate yourself from me
[8:44] i've had enough of it
[8:46] and remember jude speaks the same thing
[8:48] in the last days
[8:49] that's right they perished in the game
[8:52] singing of gokora
[8:54] we all so know what happened to korah
[8:58] and the and the rest that
[9:02] questioned god's word and
[9:05] god's wisdom of that one man leadership
[9:09] every one of them perished now
[9:13] we will notice god in the shepherd
[9:15] prophet
[9:16] showing his future plans in the next
[9:19] sign
[9:20] voice now watch we see it there now
[9:23] let's watch it in the next time
[9:25] now notice he was sent to his brethren
[9:29] in slavery under bondage
[9:33] with a message of deliverance with a
[9:36] god-given sign to prove his claims
[9:41] israel went for his message
[9:44] they believed it every one of them but
[9:47] in the evening time
[9:49] they went for his miracles but in the
[9:51] evening time
[9:52] when they he gave his message
[9:56] it was different all
[9:59] that did not believe that message died
[10:03] that's right
[10:06] what was the message the message was of
[10:09] the coming judgment
[10:11] at the evening at the evening time
[10:14] god went out through the camp of israel
[10:17] defined if the people had believed his
[10:19] shepherd
[10:20] prophet's message and all had not
[10:23] believed it
[10:24] perished now notice we're going to bring
[10:28] it over to the great shepherd just in a
[10:29] few moments
[10:31] notice the great shepherd prophet's
[10:33] ministry
[10:36] of these miracles every church opened
[10:38] and would receive him
[10:40] they wanted their sick healed they
[10:42] wanted to do great things his popularity
[10:44] was great
[10:45] but when the evening time came
[10:49] one day after he had turned water to
[10:52] wine and
[10:53] had fed thousands bread and performed
[10:56] miracles he began to sit down and talk
[10:59] to them and he said to them
[11:02] uh i and my father are one
[11:07] why sayeth thou show us the father oh
[11:09] brother
[11:10] are this man making himself equal with
[11:13] god that was too much for their
[11:15] ecclesiastical thinking
[11:18] but it was the truth he was
[11:22] but when they did many did not follow
[11:24] him then he turned around and said
[11:25] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[11:27] man and drink his blood
[11:30] you have no life in you now what do you
[11:32] think a smart
[11:33] intellectual person would thought i
[11:36] imagine the priest that had him in the
[11:37] temple
[11:38] was very was very ashamed of them having
[11:41] in there just thinking that a man would
[11:42] stand up and say a thing like that
[11:44] except you people eat my fresh and drink
[11:46] my blood said this is a human vampire
[11:48] man eat my flesh and drink well it's a
[11:50] cannibal
[11:51] you good thinking people you get away
[11:53] from such a lunatic as that
[11:56] he never explained it he just said it
[11:59] he did it to stumble him
[12:03] to separate his sheep from goats he
[12:05] needed to throw them all
[12:07] and then nobody wanted to cooperate with
[12:09] him they had no cooperation from there
[12:12] notice at the evening time god went out
[12:15] to the camps and seen
[12:17] who had believed and he did the same
[12:18] thing in the days of the great shepherd
[12:20] notice the great shepherd prophet's
[12:22] ministry but
[12:23] notice this to believers of his message
[12:27] but not this
[12:30] evening message they wouldn't believe it
[12:33] they wouldn't believe that he
[12:34] was god they wanted to make him a nice
[12:38] man they wanted to make him a prophet he
[12:41] was a nice man and he was a prophet
[12:44] but he was more than that that's a
[12:46] common teaching today
[12:48] that he's just a good man he was a
[12:50] prophet
[12:51] he was nothing short of emmanuel he was
[12:55] god
[12:55] manifested in jesus christ his son
[12:58] making him and the father one
[13:00] that's all he could be zechariah 14
[13:04] 7 i might say this speaks of the evening
[13:07] lights and message again at the end time
[13:10] did you notice that
[13:12] as many as followed moses seen the
[13:15] pillar of fire that identified him
[13:17] on mount sinai he had testified
[13:21] of and spoke of this pillar of fire
[13:23] being in a bush
[13:25] and had told him this message many of
[13:27] them wouldn't believe it
[13:28] but as many as followed him out
[13:32] of egypt come up out of the world across
[13:34] the sea of separation
[13:36] and went into the wilderness saw the
[13:39] same pillar of fire
[13:40] that he spoke of vindicating that
[13:43] shepherd prophet
[13:44] to be the shepherd of the sheep they saw
[13:48] it and many of them still didn't believe
[13:49] it
[13:50] after they saw it notice how
[13:54] again the never change in god
[13:58] the great shepherd prophet them that
[14:01] stayed
[14:02] by him and with his ministry to mount
[14:05] olive the great shepherd prophet the one
[14:08] we're speaking of jesus
[14:11] came and heard the father the same
[14:14] pillar of fire
[14:15] vindicate him that vindicated moses
[14:18] the same god that moses spoke of come
[14:21] over moses and prove by a pillar of fire
[14:23] that he
[14:24] was jehovah that was leading moses god
[14:27] was in his shepherd prophet
[14:29] here he takes the other shepherd prophet
[14:30] the great prophet the real sheep
[14:33] jesus and takes the choice of three men
[14:36] and takes them up on top of mount olives
[14:38] and there a vindicated jesus
[14:41] and even excommunity himself from all
[14:44] other people said this
[14:45] is my beloved son hear ye him
[14:49] and when they looked up they saw no man
[14:51] save jesus only
[14:53] that's right he was the one now that
[14:56] settles it as far as i'm concerned
[15:03] moses within the presence of the
[15:05] shekinah on mount
[15:06] sinai it changed his face when he come
[15:10] down he had
[15:11] to put a veil over his face the shepherd
[15:13] prophet moses
[15:15] who jehovah was in in a potion
[15:18] just to potion his faith he had the word
[15:21] in his mouth
[15:22] but notice when the great shepherds
[15:26] was in the presence of the shekinah what
[15:28] did he do
[15:29] it changed his whole countenance he
[15:32] wasn't just part of god he was all of
[15:34] god
[15:36] he was emmanuel why did it have to be
[15:40] shepherd look see now
[15:43] god almighty patrol portraying himself
[15:46] brother
[15:47] in moses the shepherd prophet
[15:51] watch how god made himself known that's
[15:53] my last remark
[15:55] see him standing anointed in the
[15:58] presence of the pillar of fire
[16:00] nobody on the mountain at all but moses
[16:04] and jehovah
[16:06] hey amen means so built
[16:09] watch put thy hand in thy bosom
[16:14] watch this second sign out of the voice
[16:17] put my hand into the bosom
[16:20] we have no reason to believe that moses
[16:22] is left-handed
[16:25] so he must have put his right hand into
[16:27] his book
[16:29] because most men are right-handed they
[16:31] put his right hand
[16:32] now watch what a picture we see here of
[16:35] jehovah in
[16:36] moses the shepherd prophet
[16:39] moses representing god
[16:42] because god was in moses
[16:46] watch him put his hand in our bosom
[16:49] what a sign now there he stands
[16:53] holding his right hand over
[16:56] his heart standing like this
[17:00] where the hidden secrets of redemption
[17:03] had been
[17:04] hid since the foundation of the world
[17:07] here's why shepherds jesus
[17:11] is god's right hand we all know
[17:15] there's moses betraying him exactly he
[17:18] helped the secrets
[17:19] of the father and it showed them to us
[17:23] notice watch him pull from his bosom his
[17:27] right hand
[17:28] smitten with deadly leprosy
[17:33] show what god would do with his right
[17:34] hand notice
[17:36] the leprosy has no cure notice again
[17:40] it wasn't just common leprosy it was in
[17:42] its last stage
[17:45] why does snow his hand was smitten with
[17:48] a horrible thing how moses must have
[17:50] felt
[17:50] when he pulled his right hand from over
[17:52] his heart out of his bosom
[17:54] and his hand was smitten with leprosy
[17:57] leprosy
[17:58] symbolizes sin incurable
[18:02] and especially in its last stage
[18:05] brethren that's where the world was when
[18:09] god pulled his right hand from his bosom
[18:12] a world was smitten with deadly
[18:15] leprosy and no cure at all for it
[18:19] so is it tonight because they won't
[18:21] receive the remedy
[18:23] the remedy was made at calvary but
[18:25] people wants to take
[18:27] some man-made prescription instead of
[18:30] god's prescription for sin
[18:34] notice it never gradually come on as the
[18:37] course of leprosy does
[18:40] but all at once when he pulled his hand
[18:43] it was smitten it was full of leprosy
[18:46] notice what god said now you won't
[18:49] gradually drift into sin
[18:51] but the day you eat thereof that day you
[18:54] die
[18:56] that's right the day you either notice
[18:59] it
[19:00] was the prophet shepherd
[19:03] that smote himself he's talked by the
[19:06] commandment of god and put his own hand
[19:09] into
[19:10] his bosom and pulled it out smith with
[19:12] leprosy the prophet
[19:13] shepherd did it himself and the great
[19:16] prophet shepherd
[19:18] jesus did it himself i'll lay my life
[19:21] down no man takes it from me
[19:26] he was the great shepherd the great
[19:29] prophet shepherd no man takes it from me
[19:32] i do it
[19:33] myself notice it didn't gradually come
[19:36] it'd come in a minute
[19:38] the great shepherd himself took our
[19:41] guilt and smote himself
[19:44] took our sins and laid it upon him
[19:49] no wonder the poet wrote mid-rendering
[19:52] rocks and darkening skies
[19:54] my savior bowed his head and died the
[19:57] opening veil revealed the way the
[19:59] heavens joyous and endless day
[20:01] that secret had been in god's bosom all
[20:03] these years
[20:04] covered by his right hand jesus
[20:08] the great shepherd took upon himself our
[20:10] guilt for us
[20:11] isaiah 53 6 said he was wounded for our
[20:15] transgressions he was bruised for our
[20:17] iniquity
[20:18] the chastim our peace was upon him and
[20:20] with his stripes we
[20:21] are healed the secret of god's healing
[20:24] laid in the bosom of jesus christ our
[20:26] god
[20:27] he was on the right hand of god that the
[20:29] only sheep that held in his bosom the
[20:31] secret
[20:31] that's reason the four shadows of it had
[20:33] to always be a sheep
[20:36] the first was the sheep the last of the
[20:38] sheep that's reason that had to come to
[20:40] a shepherd to know how to take care of
[20:42] his sheep
[20:43] you get it notice
[20:46] he was wounded for our transgressions
[20:48] bruised for our iniquity the chasm of
[20:50] our peace upon him
[20:51] notice it came quick and it left quick
[20:55] no sooner the right hand was withdrawn
[20:58] from the bosom
[20:59] the second time the deadly disease was
[21:01] gone
[21:04] when he drew it the second time and when
[21:06] the great shepherd
[21:07] the sheep prophet when he
[21:10] said on calvary's cross when he had paid
[21:13] this
[21:14] penalty of sin for us all he said it's
[21:17] finished sin was over the penalty was
[21:21] paid
[21:22] debts were settled it didn't take a year
[21:25] to finally come into it the days of
[21:27] some other reformer or something it was
[21:28] finished right then
[21:31] sin came in a moment by transgression of
[21:34] god's law
[21:36] by breaking one word
[21:39] the night my brethren your soul is over
[21:42] hell on a chain
[21:44] and that chain is not some theological
[21:46] seminary's teaching
[21:48] that chain is not some denomination or
[21:50] some creed that you're living by
[21:51] that chain is god's word jesus
[21:54] gave the human race his word to live by
[21:57] and eve
[21:58] only broke one little link of it
[22:01] and the any chain is no stronger than
[22:04] its weakest link
[22:06] when you take one word out that was the
[22:08] first of the book
[22:10] jesus came in the middle of book said
[22:11] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[22:13] every word that prostituteth thou the
[22:16] mouth of god
[22:17] that is the middle of the last of the
[22:18] book he said whosoever shall take one
[22:21] word
[22:23] mistranslate one word take one word out
[22:27] of here i'll
[22:28] take his part from the book of life
[22:32] you're passing over hell hanging on the
[22:35] word of god
[22:36] don't you let somebody squeeze something
[22:38] into you it's not thus saith
[22:40] the lord oh i see well they say surely
[22:43] oh we've done all we've done that's what
[22:45] maybe the high priest then thought in
[22:47] the days of the great shepherd
[22:48] that's what he thought that's what satan
[22:50] told us surely god will not but he did
[22:52] because he said he would
[22:54] and that's reason he'll do it again
[22:55] today no wonder he says
[22:57] as it was in the days of no whoring
[22:58] eight souls were saved by water
[23:01] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[23:02] of man
[23:04] very few or straight is the gate and
[23:07] there is a wave
[23:08] that leads to life and few there will be
[23:10] that will find it that's right because
[23:12] broad is a way that leads to destruction
[23:14] many will go in there when the great
[23:17] shepherd was smitten the great sheep
[23:19] prophet one of his smitten backer
[23:21] he said it is finished
[23:24] and that minute as soon as this shepherd
[23:26] was smitten
[23:30] sin is settled there was no more sin
[23:33] they were clean
[23:34] the penalty was paid the believers whose
[23:37] names were
[23:37] written in the book of life
[23:39] predestinated from the foundation of the
[23:41] world
[23:41] it was finished that very minute that
[23:43] jesus said it was finished
[23:45] he the great shepherd had come for his
[23:46] sheep it was finished
[23:49] god's right hand was pulled from his
[23:51] bosom
[23:52] smitten then on easter he returned it
[23:55] amen raised it up again to his bosom
[23:59] and extended it down to you and i
[24:03] in the form of his word to redeem us
[24:06] back to the original garden from which
[24:08] sin took us
[24:09] from the hidden secret
[24:12] of his great heart was revealed by
[24:16] a prophet shepherd it was revealed by
[24:20] a shepherd prophet shepard no wonder
[24:24] the mountain jumped and shouted on that
[24:26] day
[24:27] no wonder the sun hit his face and
[24:29] screamed for joy
[24:32] no wonder all nature broke loose the
[24:34] wind shook the trees until they shook
[24:36] and
[24:37] shook and joyed and jumped
[24:42] they steamed the prophet shepherd on the
[24:45] mountain redeem every name on the book
[24:48] of life and they seen it their own
[24:50] nature was redeemed they screamed and
[24:53] jumped and
[24:54] the world went into an earthquake and
[24:57] the mountains
[24:58] rent and the rocks fell out and the sun
[25:00] went down
[25:01] and everything taking place like
[25:05] any meeting when the
[25:08] shepherd reveals to you that it's
[25:10] finished
[25:12] there are seeing jumping spells and joy
[25:14] spells
[25:16] but there was nobody hurt the mountains
[25:19] rung out
[25:20] and the the sun went down and everything
[25:22] took place
[25:23] but there was nobody hurt and i've seen
[25:26] meetings for the power of god
[25:28] was revealed to the people that they
[25:29] were free from the world and the things
[25:31] of the world
[25:32] and the joy of the lord killed the
[25:34] congregation they stood and screamed and
[25:36] cried
[25:37] and shouted to the top of their voice
[25:39] for the glory of god i
[25:40] never did see anything disorderly
[25:44] there's always writing orders because
[25:47] they had recognized
[25:48] that their name that had been written on
[25:50] the lamb's book of life before the
[25:52] foundation of the world
[25:54] the great prophet shepherd had brought
[25:56] them the message and they were delivered
[25:58] the prophet shepherd no matter what the
[26:00] other ecclesiastical rim said about it
[26:03] they knew what had happened
[26:04] just as them shepherds did back there
[26:06] they know what took place no man has a
[26:11] right to enter the sacred desk to preach
[26:13] the word
[26:14] until he did as moses did
[26:17] meet god himself upon grounds
[26:21] word that there's no theologian can
[26:23] explain it away
[26:25] moses was there no matter how israel's
[26:28] messenger said or
[26:29] the nonsense you just imagine you saw
[26:31] this it's nonsense
[26:32] you couldn't take it away from him he
[26:35] knowed he was there he was the one it
[26:37] happened
[26:38] to and no man by a theological
[26:41] degree or some doctor's degree has her
[26:44] right behind the pulpit to claim the
[26:45] message of jesus christ
[26:47] until he's first met god face to face
[26:50] in the pillar of power there's a little
[26:53] right to call himself a messenger
[26:54] because all the theologians in the world
[26:57] couldn't explain that away from you
[26:58] it happened to you you were there you
[27:01] didn't know about it
[27:02] care what anybody else says or how much
[27:04] they can say the days is gone it isn't
[27:06] so
[27:06] it happened to you it's according to the
[27:09] word
[27:10] yes that's the reason moses knew this
[27:12] voice that spoke to him
[27:13] was a word voice he know that god has
[27:17] told abraham
[27:18] your seat your soldier for 400 years but
[27:21] i
[27:21] will deliver them and he knowed the 400
[27:25] years was
[27:26] up and he was called to do it man and
[27:29] women
[27:30] god promised in this last days that he
[27:32] had poured out his spirit upon
[27:34] all flesh he promised he'd send it back
[27:36] to the holy ghost it is
[27:38] called a bride
[27:41] that's spotter wrinkle he promised to do
[27:44] it
[27:44] he'll do it don't listen to these harlem
[27:47] shepherds
[27:48] they'll lead you astray the holy spirit
[27:50] is a shepherd
[27:51] to feed you sheep food from this word
[27:55] it always comes by the shepherd he is
[27:58] our shepherd
[27:59] listen to him you are the sheep of his
[28:00] foe if you are you hear his voice
[28:04] not what somebody else says you hear
[28:05] what he said
[28:07] a strange voice you know nothing about
[28:09] it
[28:10] oh my listen to the mighty
[28:14] shepherd prophet again interpreting
[28:18] and introducing to them john
[28:21] when he stood in the river of jordan
[28:23] look what he said
[28:25] standing there preaching he said the
[28:27] hour is coming
[28:28] notice john was a priest son they always
[28:32] follow
[28:32] the line of their father that's why we
[28:34] got our names but whatever they did
[28:37] they called him and john was supposed to
[28:39] be a priest
[28:41] like his father and you know his mother
[28:44] uh when she uh had been conceived
[28:48] at the age of the lord met his father
[28:49] zachariah and went home
[28:52] to elizabeth and she was already
[28:56] six months in to be mother but she had
[28:59] no life yet
[29:00] she was scared because the baby hadn't
[29:03] moved that's
[29:03] not normal and the holy ghost the angel
[29:06] of the lord appeared to mary
[29:08] and told her that she's gonna have a
[29:09] baby knowing no man
[29:11] and told her about elizabeth's condition
[29:14] she went up the hills of judea to tell
[29:17] elizabeth
[29:18] and when she met elizabeth she told her
[29:20] that she was going to be a mother and
[29:21] she couldn't understand it knowing no
[29:23] man but she said
[29:25] uh the holy spirit overshadowed me and
[29:27] said that this holy thing that'll be
[29:29] born to me will be called the son of god
[29:31] and i'll call his name
[29:32] jesus and the first time that the name
[29:34] jesus has ever spoken in human life
[29:36] a little dead baby in its mother's womb
[29:39] leaped for joy
[29:41] and shouted and jumped in the womb of a
[29:44] mother
[29:45] and it never had received life yet the
[29:47] name of
[29:48] jesus christ spoke life into a dead baby
[29:52] what ought to do in a church that claims
[29:55] to be
[29:55] foreign again and we set as
[29:59] towerism bumps on a pickle
[30:03] and let such things go
[30:07] and on to raise and testify your
[30:10] conviction and condemn
[30:11] all this nonsense make jesus christ the
[30:15] same yesterday and forever
[30:17] it's christmas time get out these santa
[30:20] clauses and stuff
[30:21] away with that nonsense of
[30:24] commercializing
[30:26] wherever he hears about santa claus in
[30:28] the bible it's a roman mythology
[30:30] there's nothing to it at all there is no
[30:32] such a thing don't teach your children
[30:34] such nonsense is that
[30:38] when one day you'll have to tell him
[30:39] that it was all a blind story then
[30:41] you've lied to your child
[30:43] and it'll hurt your testimony about
[30:45] jesus christ you'll say maybe it's the
[30:47] same thing
[30:49] but jesus christ the great shepherd
[30:51] prophet
[30:52] back into the christmas world belongs
[30:55] notice listen to this prophet john as he
[30:59] stands there
[30:59] we all know it is a great shepherd
[31:01] prophet now he had a message
[31:03] the angel know that he was going to
[31:04] introduce jesus now he couldn't go to
[31:06] some seminary
[31:07] they said now you know that dr so-and-so
[31:09] is just the man to take the place now
[31:11] you're to introduce him and you know
[31:12] that just see he couldn't get mixed up
[31:14] with man
[31:15] at the age of nine years old we're told
[31:17] he went into the wilderness
[31:19] to prepare before god that's where the
[31:21] shepherds come from
[31:23] notice this message wasn't like a
[31:24] theologian with some great
[31:26] big swelling words of some degree he
[31:29] said oh you
[31:30] generation of snakes telling religious
[31:33] man
[31:37] you're a bunch of snakes that's what
[31:38] he'd seen the wilderness he saw the
[31:40] snake
[31:40] lowest thing he could find was a snake
[31:43] and he called them priest
[31:44] and clergymen and theologians of that
[31:46] day a bunch of snakes
[31:50] said who's warned you from the wrath to
[31:51] come don't begin to say we belong to
[31:54] this and we belong to that
[31:56] for i say unto you that god is able of
[31:58] these stones to rise children abraham
[32:00] stones what had seen the wilderness also
[32:02] the axes laid to the root of the tree
[32:04] that's what he'd been seeing snakes
[32:06] trees wilderness and
[32:08] see that was his message he didn't know
[32:10] the great swelling words of some great
[32:11] doctor of divinity could explain it all
[32:13] away
[32:14] he just preached exactly the line of
[32:16] nature
[32:17] that's why we're showing here the
[32:19] shepherd's staff the shepherd the sheep
[32:21] the lion of nature what did he do
[32:25] he had a great thing to do he was the
[32:27] one that would know the messiah he said
[32:29] i say he's standing here among you now
[32:31] and you don't know him because your
[32:33] theology has got you so tied up you
[32:34] don't know where you're at
[32:37] one day jesus come walking out he says
[32:38] behold
[32:40] there comes the lamb of god that takes
[32:42] away the sin of the world
[32:43] the lamb hallelujah the real atonement
[32:47] there comes whatever sheep from the
[32:49] garden of eden down has shattered
[32:52] an ordinary man walking down the earth
[32:55] they said john how did you know it
[32:57] i didn't see one thing different but i
[32:59] bare record
[33:01] i saw the spirit of god descending like
[33:04] a dove and a voice saying this is my
[33:06] beloved
[33:07] in whom i am pleased to dwell in watch
[33:10] the dove and the lamb
[33:14] yeah what if it had been a what if it
[33:16] had been something what if it had been a
[33:17] wolf standing there
[33:18] well that lamb could not have went upon
[33:20] or that dove god symbolized himself with
[33:22] the dove
[33:23] the most sneakers of all the birds of
[33:25] the heaven his son
[33:27] by a sheep the most meekest of all the
[33:29] animals on earth
[33:31] neither clean bird of the heaven not a
[33:33] crow not a vulture but a dove
[33:36] not a pig but a lamb
[33:39] any other nature wouldn't have blended
[33:41] together
[33:42] and notice when the dove come upon the
[33:45] lamb it let him
[33:47] not the way he would but the way the
[33:49] father would leave
[33:50] that's the way our real lamb is today
[33:53] oh christmas time sheep
[33:57] don't you know that god only leads by
[34:00] his word
[34:01] that's his staff
[34:04] notice nothing would have took place but
[34:06] john said the rest of them didn't see it
[34:08] but i bear record i saw it
[34:10] introducing behold the lamb of god that
[34:12] takes away the sins of the world
[34:15] may i not introduce my christmas message
[34:18] and when i'm closing now
[34:20] jesus christ is saying it should be
[34:22] delayed forever
[34:24] it's that same lamb he's just as much
[34:27] the lamb today as he was then
[34:29] he's just as much here as he was there
[34:32] for his word is the same wherever two or
[34:34] three are gathered in mining there i am
[34:35] in the midst of them
[34:36] that's exactly what he said he never
[34:39] changes he's
[34:40] god the word he never changes still
[34:43] giving his sheep and feeding them by his
[34:46] shepherd prophet
[34:48] his sheep food first
[34:52] not to the theologian to his sheep
[34:56] they won't how can their mothers eat it
[35:00] but the wise notices but the wise and
[35:03] intellectual
[35:04] well-trained of the world still
[35:09] desire to say there is a santa claus
[35:13] there's all kinds of fiction and stuff
[35:15] that they worship
[35:17] because they won't accept him the word
[35:20] because in their denominations it
[35:23] doesn't fit their taste
[35:26] the harling shepherds of the day the
[35:28] hirelings
[35:30] from creed that'll want to unite you
[35:33] under one goat
[35:36] don't you believe it
[35:37] [Music]
[35:40] they'll lead you to the slaughter pen
[35:43] here the great shepherd that was born
[35:46] 1900 years ago
[35:47] this month sometime out honoring his
[35:50] message come to true shepherds
[35:52] that knowed how to take care of sheep
[35:56] notice him they still desire they won't
[35:58] accept it today just the same as they
[36:00] didn't then because
[36:01] it does not affect their ecclesiastical
[36:03] taste
[36:04] they turn that word around and make it
[36:06] suit their organization
[36:08] and they won't preach the word they
[36:11] won't they say well that was for the
[36:12] day's apostles
[36:13] it doesn't mean this it means just
[36:15] exactly what it says
[36:17] this needs nobody to improv interpret it
[36:19] for him now
[36:20] let us at this hour bow our heads and
[36:24] hearts towards the dust of the earth
[36:26] and hasten real quick to a manger
[36:43] [Music]
[38:14] you
