[39:13] &gt;&gt; we're coming before you in the name of
[39:15] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:17] This is your time, Lord, that you would
[39:20] have preeminence
[39:22] over this service from the beginning
[39:25] until the end. Oh God, Father, Lord, we
[39:28] can already feel your presence in this
[39:30] room because we're about to have church
[39:33] this morning. Father,
[39:35] &gt;&gt; we cannot have church without you being
[39:37] present. That's why, Father, we invite
[39:40] you that you would have the preeminence,
[39:43] that you would have the control that
[39:45] Lord, you will capture, oh God, every
[39:47] spirit, oh Father, anything that is not
[39:50] called upon your name, Lord God, we
[39:52] remove it out of this place in the name
[39:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ. the only name
[39:56] that is given unto us that all knee
[39:58] shall bow and is in the name of Jesus
[40:01] Christ. Father, that we give you this
[40:03] this moment. Father,
[40:05] &gt;&gt; may you break the bread of life just the
[40:07] way you always do. Father, may we
[40:09] recognize that you are here, Lord God.
[40:11] Not to recognize one another or the
[40:13] preacher behind the pulpit, but to
[40:16] recognize you, the King of King, the
[40:18] Lord of Lord, the one who broke the
[40:20] bread and they recognized then, oh, God
[40:22] has a disciple on the way of Emas. They
[40:25] didn't know who was talking to them, oh
[40:26] God. But the way you broke the bread,
[40:29] they recognize that that was you,
[40:30] Father. We asking that this morning, may
[40:32] you break, oh God, the bread in your own
[40:34] manner. They will recognize this is not
[40:36] a man that can break such bread. Lord,
[40:38] only you can do that. Father, may we
[40:41] have a revival this morning. Oh God, we
[40:43] ready, oh God, Father, that you will
[40:45] change our life, oh Father, that you
[40:47] will renew our strength, oh God. Father,
[40:50] those that are weak, oh God, that you,
[40:52] oh God, strengthen them, oh Father,
[40:54] those that are sick, oh God, may the
[40:55] healing power cross this, oh God,
[40:57] Father, this building this morning that
[40:59] every single sick person, oh God, leave
[41:02] this this place, oh God, completely
[41:04] healed, Father, may you have your way,
[41:06] oh God. Father, bless us, oh God.
[41:08] Father, may you bless your servant, our
[41:10] pastor, maybe standing behind the pulpit
[41:12] this morning. Oh God, Father, may you
[41:14] come and touch him, oh Father. Lord, may
[41:16] you be that angel behind him that will
[41:18] minister the word to your people.
[41:20] Father, do the same for me this morning.
[41:21] Oh God, Father, bless your people as
[41:23] they under expectation to receive
[41:26] something from you, God. Oh, may you
[41:28] come out of history and be real in our
[41:29] midst, Father, this morning. That's why
[41:31] we are under expectation to receive and
[41:33] to see God. Bless your word now, oh God,
[41:36] as we have asked these things in the
[41:38] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[41:40] Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; May God bless you once again. We'll open
[41:44] our Bibles in the book of
[41:47] of Psalms.
[41:50] Thank you so much, musician. Thank you,
[41:51] brother Lawrence.
[41:55] Psalm chapter 40 46.
[42:00] How many of us are happy to be here?
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my, you know, it's it's it's it's a
[42:06] privilege to to be in the house of the
[42:08] Lord. You know,
[42:09] &gt;&gt; this morning maybe there's there are
[42:11] many people, you know,
[42:12] &gt;&gt; maybe they had a a long night and maybe
[42:15] drinking and smoking all night
[42:17] &gt;&gt; and this morning they can't show up to
[42:19] church,
[42:19] &gt;&gt; but you are here,
[42:21] &gt;&gt; you know. So, it's a blessing. It's a
[42:23] privilege for be here to be here.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Is that okay if we can all read Psalm
[42:27] chapter 46? All of us together. Is that
[42:29] okay?
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Ready? God bless you.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; You make me feel comfortable. Thank you.
[42:34] I appreciate that.
[42:38] Psalm chapter 46.
[42:43] Psalm 46. If they can project that for
[42:45] us already. To the chief musician for
[42:48] the sons of Kora, the son upon Almouth.
[42:51] Okay, we can read together. God is our
[42:54] refuge and strength, a present help in
[42:57] in trouble. Therefore will we not fear,
[43:01] though the earth move, and though the
[43:04] mountains be carried into the midst of
[43:06] the sea. Though the water thereof roar
[43:10] and be troubled, though the mountains
[43:13] shake with swelling thereof, sill up.
[43:16] There is a river, the streams whereof
[43:19] shall make glad the city of God, the
[43:22] holy place of the tabernacle of the most
[43:24] high. God is in the midst of her. She
[43:28] shall not be removed. God shall help her
[43:32] and that right early the heathen rage
[43:35] and the kingdom were moved. The all the
[43:38] results and the earth melted. The Lord
[43:41] of host is with us. The God of Jacob is
[43:45] our refuge. Salah. Come behold the works
[43:48] of the Lord. What desolations he has
[43:51] made in the earth. He maketh war to
[43:54] cease unto the end of the earth. He
[43:56] breakth the bow and cutth the spear in
[43:59] thunder. He burneth the chariot in fire.
[44:03] Be still and know that I am God. I will
[44:06] be exalted among the heen. I will be
[44:09] exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts
[44:12] is with us. The God of Jacob is our
[44:16] refuge. Salah. Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 12. Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; What a powerful scripture there. My
[44:26] goodness.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 12
[44:34] verse 22.
[44:38] Uh let's let's start at 25. Sorry, I'll
[44:40] start reading at 25
[44:44] and then you don't have to read. I I'll
[44:46] read myself and we'll go a little faster
[44:47] here.
[44:49] See that you refuse not him that
[44:52] speaketh. That's a present tense.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; For if they escape not who refuse him
[45:00] that speak on earth, how much more
[45:05] shall not we escape? If we turn away
[45:08] from him that speaketh from heaven,
[45:11] still present tense.
[45:13] whose voice then shook the earth, but
[45:16] now he has promised, saying, "Yet once
[45:20] more, acknowled."
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[45:28] &gt;&gt; And his word yet once more signifyth the
[45:32] removing of the those things that are
[45:35] shaken as of things that are made. Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; That those things which cannot be shaken
[45:43] &gt;&gt; may remain.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Now verse 28. Wherefore we receiving
[45:51] we receiving
[45:53] &gt;&gt; receiving it's a continuous right?
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[46:00] cannot be moved.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Let us have grace whereby we may serve
[46:04] God acceptably with reverence and godly
[46:08] fear. For our God is a consuming fire.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we bow our head just for a
[46:14] few minutes? Lord,
[46:16] &gt;&gt; now this is your moment. Father, may you
[46:18] have your prayer in us now. Father,
[46:20] &gt;&gt; may you bless us in your presence in
[46:22] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Uh hope that all of us are doing well. I
[46:37] I want to appreciate brother one
[46:41] uh for giving me the chance to be
[46:43] standing here. Uh it's it's a it's it's
[46:46] a great privilege you know uh I just
[46:51] pray that the Lord will help me this
[46:52] morning. Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; I have a lot of thoughts
[46:56] uh that the Lord has been min has
[46:58] ministered to me
[47:00] uh few I don't know if it was few weeks
[47:03] ago
[47:05] uh I think we were just listening to the
[47:07] tape with the family every Thursday we
[47:08] listened to it and while we were
[47:11] listening to it the Lord just gave me a
[47:14] thought I didn't even know that brother
[47:15] one wanted me to speak
[47:17] &gt;&gt; so as I'm I'm I was listening to the
[47:20] tape something just brother Benham says
[47:22] something that just shocked me. I mean,
[47:24] I was like, "Oh my goodness, what all of
[47:26] this thing means."
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Then I just pray about it. I think I was
[47:31] sitting by my wife. I stay quiet. I just
[47:33] took my note. I was just writing things
[47:34] down. And and uh tonight I want to speak
[47:38] on born of a kingdom that cannot be
[47:42] moved.
[47:45] Born of a kingdom that cannot be moved.
[47:50] And I would ask you to pay attention.
[47:53] I'll try to slow down. If I go too fast,
[47:56] we're going to miss the point because it
[47:57] is very very important. I mean,
[48:00] everything in the word of God is
[48:01] important. Is that right?
[48:03] &gt;&gt; But there are few things that I don't
[48:05] know. I would just probably minister the
[48:07] way God put in my heart and just have
[48:09] your Bible ready because we'll be going
[48:11] back and forth because it's kind of hard
[48:13] for me to preach without the Bible. So,
[48:15] you know, I think it will help me a
[48:17] little bit to go fast to him. Now,
[48:21] uh, we we just read in the book of, uh,
[48:24] let's go back to the book of Psalms for
[48:25] a minute here. Psalm 46.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; You're happy to be here.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you know that it's the
[48:33] word, you can say amen. So, feel free
[48:36] because when you say amen is, so be it.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; You know, it's the word of God is not my
[48:41] words. I can only read what the word
[48:43] says. Is that right?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible begins to say our God is our
[48:48] refuge
[48:49] &gt;&gt; and strength, right?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Is a place our God is a place to run to
[48:55] for safety.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; He's a protection from storm and enemies
[49:01] and even avengers of avengers of blood
[49:04] &gt;&gt; or even danger. Is that right?
[49:07] &gt;&gt; He is a secure place and a a place of
[49:11] safety to be covered. Now in the Old
[49:14] Testament, a place of refuge, there were
[49:17] six cities of refuge. Is that right?
[49:20] Now, six was on one side of the Jordan
[49:22] and six on the other side of the Jordan.
[49:25] So if it happens that you had killed
[49:27] somebody by mistake, you have to run to
[49:30] that city really quick. Are you with me?
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Because the avenger of blood will come
[49:34] and say, "Oh, this guy had killed my
[49:36] sister or killed my brother." They will
[49:38] come and run after you, right? And if
[49:40] you are innocent, you didn't do it, you
[49:42] know, willingly, you know, it just
[49:44] happened, then you have to run to that
[49:46] city.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; And then God had had told Joshua or
[49:50] Moses, if I'm not mistaken, you know, to
[49:52] to build those city so that whoever can
[49:55] run to can find refuge there.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; And God is our city of refuge.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; He is our seven city of refuge that we
[50:02] can run to.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; He's a place of protection. When the
[50:07] storm of life comes around, we can't run
[50:09] to Jesus Christ.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the only place that we
[50:12] can go.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; In this hour that we living in, there is
[50:15] not a specific city that we can run to.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Do we have a city like that?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Because sin is everywhere.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; There's nowhere else to run.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; But you know that you have a king.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ that you can run
[50:28] to.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; And now David is saying, can you imagine
[50:32] is a man is seeing he knows the
[50:34] principle of the city of refuge. when he
[50:36] is into the presence of God is thinking
[50:38] or say God after I've read about the
[50:41] city of refuge I found none around me
[50:44] &gt;&gt; the only place I can go to is unto you
[50:46] &gt;&gt; amen
[50:47] &gt;&gt; you see you have to come to that place
[50:49] you have to come to that conclusion
[50:50] where you look at your father your
[50:52] mother your brothers there's nobody that
[50:53] can help you
[50:55] &gt;&gt; but you have to look up
[50:57] &gt;&gt; that's where your help will come from
[50:59] &gt;&gt; don't expect anything from somebody look
[51:02] up to God
[51:04] &gt;&gt; he's the only one who knows what is
[51:05] inside of your heart.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Even if you do not express it, God knows
[51:09] what is inside of your heart.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Glory. And he is your refuge.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is your hiding place.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And he is a present help.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Not just the past help.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; He is the present help. Help.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; You know, brother says something. He
[51:27] says if he is infinite, it cannot be
[51:29] infinite without being omnip omnipotent.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he cannot be omnipotent
[51:34] without being omnipresent.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; He cannot be omnipresent without being
[51:38] omnisient.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; So if God shows up this morning,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; he carries all his power along with him.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; So if you believe that God is the same
[51:48] yesterday, today, and forever,
[51:50] &gt;&gt; you must also believe that he can deal
[51:51] with your situation
[51:53] &gt;&gt; because he cannot show up into a place
[51:55] and he say I'm present, but he's not
[51:57] omnipotent.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; No way.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So once he is present there, he
[52:01] has to show his omnipotence.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; You see sometime we think God is present
[52:07] but yet we like oh no he's not going to
[52:09] do it. No if he is present and ask
[52:11] whatever you want.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Sometime we put God into a box
[52:18] &gt;&gt; and we go to that box only when we need
[52:19] it.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; But we can create an atmosphere like
[52:22] this morning
[52:24] &gt;&gt; and once it shows up then whatever you
[52:26] need God can give it to you. Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon will preach in
[52:30] the midst of the service. He says the
[52:32] angel is there.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; The only thing he's asking people to do
[52:35] is to believe
[52:36] &gt;&gt; because if the angel of the Lord is
[52:38] there, whatever you need, God can give
[52:40] it to you.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Because you are in the presence of the
[52:44] king.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Our God is present. He never been, you
[52:51] know, surprised by any event.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing that happened in your
[52:55] life that God does not know about.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. When something happened to you,
[52:59] you're so frustrated. You're like, "Oh,
[53:00] wow." You know, God, where were you?
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Does it happen to us? Is that right?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; We question say, "Man, Lord, I was just
[53:07] sleeping. I don't know what happened."
[53:10] &gt;&gt; But you don't realize that he knew that
[53:12] that thing had to happen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it would not be God.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; He knows the end before the beginning.
[53:18] So everything that you're going through
[53:20] is not a surprise to him.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; He's not surprised by any event. Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what you're going
[53:27] through.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; God knows what you are dealing with.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; He's not surprised.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; He knows the end before the beginning.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; He does not help from far.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; He is near. He's present.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Right now in your situation
[53:42] &gt;&gt; in your trial
[53:43] &gt;&gt; is wellproven help.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; In time of trouble.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you don't just have to say
[53:53] amen. You have to really believe that.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And after you have believed that, you
[53:56] have to confess it.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; You see, faith without work is dead.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; To prove your faith from your work.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; So if you truly believe, then confess it
[54:08] with your mouth.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Then if you confess it with your mouth,
[54:10] go do it.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; That will prove that you believe it.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So if you say God will
[54:17] heal me, you believe God, then walk and
[54:19] confess that God has healed you. Yes.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; So if you cannot confess, it means that
[54:23] you have not believed it yet.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; That's as simple as simple can be.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; So if you believe it, prove it that you
[54:30] believe it.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Faith is not dead. Faith is in action.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Faith moves.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; You know, faith has has hair on the
[54:40] chest.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Faith is a person. You have to believe
[54:44] it.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible continually says do not
[54:50] fear though the earth be removed
[54:52] &gt;&gt; the water roar and trouble mountains
[54:54] shake
[54:55] &gt;&gt; even if we see nations are being
[54:57] collapsing
[54:59] &gt;&gt; right
[54:59] &gt;&gt; right
[55:00] &gt;&gt; who have seen it maybe you've been in a
[55:02] different planet
[55:04] &gt;&gt; those that are on earth knows that
[55:05] there's a lot going on right now is that
[55:06] right
[55:08] &gt;&gt; we can be honest about it that's okay
[55:10] &gt;&gt; you know we having earthquakes that in
[55:13] diverse places flood disaster cares and
[55:16] whatn not
[55:17] &gt;&gt; and people are fearing
[55:18] But God is telling you, don't fear.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Because you have a God.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; People out there, they do not have a
[55:25] God.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; They're confused. They don't know what
[55:28] happened.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; But you know what happened?
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Because the word said it.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; You will wonder why did God allow all of
[55:36] these things? Did if your God was God,
[55:38] why is he allowing all of these things
[55:40] to happen?
[55:41] &gt;&gt; But you as a Christian, you would tell
[55:42] them don't worry about it. My God
[55:44] already said it. It will happen. So I'm
[55:46] not surprised by any event.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[55:51] &gt;&gt; So I should not fear
[55:53] &gt;&gt; because he have already said it.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And I know what will be the next move.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; That's why God has given us the word.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; We should not feed on social media. We
[56:02] should feed on the word because the word
[56:04] tells us what will happen.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; We are not surprised.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; I mean if you are surprised about
[56:08] something that is happening means that
[56:10] you're not reading the word.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; True. That that's true
[56:15] &gt;&gt; because God has said it.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; You should not you should not be shaken.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; To us. We were warned of these things
[56:23] that will happen in the world.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Now, if you watch the Bible, uh it says
[56:28] salah after that, right?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; It's a pause that you might reflect.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Salah means it's a pause. Stop a little
[56:38] bit and think.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Reflect on what was said.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. God bless you.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; So you see God is the present help in
[56:47] time of need.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; The earth will shake but you will not
[56:51] shake.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; So if you are shaking there is something
[56:55] wrong somewhere.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; You're not supposed to be shaking.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be standing and
[57:01] thanking God for what you have.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Christ. But the bi the Bible says
[57:10] something here. If I can continue.
[57:13] Uh, though the water thereof
[57:16] roar and be troubled, though the
[57:18] mountains shake with swelling, thereof,
[57:20] there is a river, the stream where shall
[57:23] make glad the city of God, the holy
[57:26] place of the tabernacle of the most
[57:27] high. Now the Bible says God is in the
[57:32] midst of her.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; You you catch that?
[57:39] So there is a shaking that is happening.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; But God is in the midst of her.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; She He is in the midst of her. She shall
[57:50] not be moved.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[57:53] &gt;&gt; She shall not be moved.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; God shall help her.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; And that right early.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Christ is with her.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Not just with her.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Christ is in her.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Not just a God that is around you,
[58:12] &gt;&gt; but a God that is in you.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; So when Christ is in you,
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; you cannot fear.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Because he is in the midst is inside of
[58:25] you.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; You see, and she cannot neither be
[58:32] shaken or move.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; She's stable. Yes.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And that speaks of the gentile bride
[58:40] &gt;&gt; in this last day.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; This gentile bride would not move.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Because the job has already been done.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a finished work.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Why are you moving? Why are you tossed
[58:54] about?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Why are you crying? Speak the word.
[58:58] Because this is a time when the word has
[59:00] been spoken.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Don't just say I believe it. Say it with
[59:05] your mouth.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Confess it. Because we have a high
[59:08] priest that can be touched by the
[59:10] feeling of your infirmity.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; You must confess.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; You must profess
[59:17] &gt;&gt; is the same thing.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ. She is his
[59:24] temple on earth. Now,
[59:27] &gt;&gt; you are the temple. You are the
[59:28] tabernacle of God Almighty.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to see the eyes of
[59:33] God, don't look somewhere else.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; There is a body here of the believer.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You know, the woman at the Oh my, I'm
[59:42] going a little off here. The woman that
[59:45] had the the blood issue came to Jesus
[59:48] and touch him.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not even know that that woman
[59:51] will come.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says virtue came out of her.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Of him. Sorry. Yeah.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Oh, I feel that I'm weak."
[1:00:01] And Peter says, "There's a lot of people
[1:00:03] touching you."
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; You know what what virtue is? Virtue is
[1:00:06] power.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; It's strength.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; So, somebody that is sick, that's why
[1:00:12] Paul that that scripture, right, to cut
[1:00:15] his own clothes and give to the sick.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Do you catch that in the book of Acts?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Because he got it also from from, you
[1:00:23] know, they took the body. You know,
[1:00:25] remember Elijah?
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. the man that was dead that you know
[1:00:28] the throne is close to the the bone of
[1:00:30] Elijah and he came back to life
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; because there were power inside of that
[1:00:33] bone
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; so if you live a life for example if
[1:00:38] somebody has a need I'm standing here
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; you have a need in your heart
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; you can touch God
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; and I'll feel weak as I'm standing here
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; that it would change my completely my
[1:00:48] servant because somebody's inside he has
[1:00:50] a burden
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; so you're not touching me you're
[1:00:53] touching the high priest
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So my the job of a minister is just to
[1:00:58] be available.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; You see God want a willing body.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; A willing heart. Somebody that can say
[1:01:06] God here am I. I'm available.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; So he will use you. He will take you and
[1:01:11] move you everywhere he wants to.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Because the gift is not to just say
[1:01:16] things.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; The gift is to know how to yield to him.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; That's what a gift is.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Very important.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:26] And she is a joint hair with him.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; She has the mind of Christ.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; She's standing strong and fearless.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; She has dust said the Lord in this age.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; She is the final voice under her
[1:01:39] messenger.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; That's what our power for this bride is.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Saints, you must come to realize who you
[1:01:46] are.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; You are the power that is shaking this
[1:01:50] hour. Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Even at work,
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; people look at you, sister,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; you're living right.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; You are shaking their life. You don't
[1:01:59] know that.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; But when they look at you and say,
[1:02:01] "Well, I wish I was that person."
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was something that
[1:02:05] God has dropped in your heart that is
[1:02:08] different.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Is to let to to let the world know that
[1:02:13] in this hour we have Christians. Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; It's not just how we can talk about it,
[1:02:19] but how can our life reflect Christ?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; In Antioch, they were called Christian
[1:02:25] because of the way they live.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; They saw how God Jesus was living. They
[1:02:29] say, "Oh, this one are Christian."
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Because they could see the way they were
[1:02:33] talking.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Said, "No, no, no. The way they live is
[1:02:36] different."
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; They hid and rage. The kingdom were
[1:02:44] moved. There were men in the scripture
[1:02:48] that tried to mess up with the people of
[1:02:50] God.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh stood up
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; to defile the God of Israel.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; It says, "Who is the Lord that I should
[1:02:57] obey him?
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; What happened to him?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; He was plagued
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; with different sickness and pestimy and
[1:03:05] what not." At the end, death
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; and many of his army got drowned. This
[1:03:11] is a man that is standing against God.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; This is a man standing against the
[1:03:18] people of God.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; You see, if you are under, if you are
[1:03:22] following the leadership of God, anybody
[1:03:25] that touches you touches God.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Because you are commissioned to fulfill
[1:03:30] something for this hour.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; So, anybody that will touch you,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; will touch God directly.
[1:03:38] In Egypt, they saw a man called Moses.
[1:03:41] He was old walking.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; But yet, if you touch Moses,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; you touch the God of heaven.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; And in this room, there are people that
[1:03:49] you shouldn't touch.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; If you touch them, you touch God.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; You must know who you are.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Nobody has a right to touch you, saints.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You came from God.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; God is incomplete without you.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; God is incomplete without you.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Saints, let let's stop a little bit
[1:04:20] here.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; In other nations, you know, they will
[1:04:24] post somewhere in the billboard, they'll
[1:04:27] put an animal, for example, a gorilla
[1:04:28] somewhere there, right?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; They say if you if you kill that
[1:04:31] gorilla, you're gonna go to prison. Is
[1:04:34] that right? Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; That gorilla is protected
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; by the government.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; That's just an animal.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, God said, "Do not touch
[1:04:45] my anointed one. Do you profit no arm is
[1:04:48] not a slip of
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; if a government can protect an animal,
[1:04:53] how much more are you?
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; You worth more than an animal, man.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God
[1:05:00] standing in heavenly places
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. You have to believe
[1:05:04] that. Say,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; oh, glory to. How many of us believe
[1:05:08] that?
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; You are a son and a daughter of God.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Nobody can touch you.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Not even Satan can touch you. No demon
[1:05:18] in hell can touch you.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; You are all powerful as your father is.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You know, I I was pushing, you know, the
[1:05:31] stroller with my wife this morning.
[1:05:33] There was something that shocked me a
[1:05:34] little bit. I'm pushing the stroll and
[1:05:36] my wife was behind me and as I'm
[1:05:38] pushing, you know, and I told Joseph,
[1:05:41] you say, you know, Joseph was sitting in
[1:05:42] the front. So I told Joseph, "Please,
[1:05:44] Joseph, kick the door so you can't open
[1:05:46] it." But I was the one pushing. Joseph
[1:05:49] put his leg like this and he pushed he
[1:05:51] pushed and the door opened. I told my
[1:05:53] wife, he said, I said, "Joseph pushed
[1:05:55] the door." Means that Joseph did push
[1:05:56] the door. But the power behind Joseph is
[1:05:58] not Joseph.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; It's me pushing the stroller. Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; You see, it's the same thing with God.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; God will tell you, "Push the stroller.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; You just put your legs up. You push that
[1:06:09] door. You kick that door." But the power
[1:06:11] behind that. Oh, glory to God. It's God
[1:06:14] Almighty that is pushing.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; You see, when you look everywhere, you
[1:06:19] see God.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Even a little stroller.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You are a son of God.
[1:06:26] You are a daughter of God. You are more
[1:06:29] than able to speak the word to come to
[1:06:30] pass.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; The Bible speak of sin the king of
[1:06:39] Assyria. He mocked God
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; and in the night the angel came and
[1:06:43] killed all the soldiers.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; It says because this man is trying to
[1:06:48] defile me.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; He's talking the God of Israel. You know
[1:06:51] there are many nation that are
[1:06:53] destroyed. The God of Egyptians stood
[1:06:55] up. They were not able to solve you, to
[1:06:58] save you. Do you think you Israel will
[1:06:59] stand before me? The king took that
[1:07:01] letter, said, "Let me go to the temple."
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; He went and kneel down. He said, "God,
[1:07:06] they they didn't challenge me.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; They didn't challenge me. They
[1:07:12] challenged you, Lord."
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And God stood up. He says to the
[1:07:15] prophet, he says, "You go tell the king.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. I will kill that
[1:07:21] nation. I'll destroy them."
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] Let people challenge your God.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't take it personal.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; When somebody step on your to don't take
[1:07:31] it personal.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Let him do what he does best.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; This man called me, king of Babylon,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; claim by pride. It says he claimed the
[1:07:47] glory belonged to him. He thought it was
[1:07:49] somebody.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; He was driven mad for seven years.
[1:07:53] You don't you don't take the glory. You
[1:07:55] know, everything that belongs to God
[1:07:56] belongs to him.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Don't mess with that.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; You know, and what about Basar?
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; It took of he blasphemed by using the
[1:08:05] temple vessels,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; And said, "Oh, let me have a party with
[1:08:08] these ones."
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; The finger of God came out.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; And rode on the wall.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; It was a handwriting on the wall. the
[1:08:18] finger of God.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God was riding on the
[1:08:22] wall.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; And that very same night,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; oh yes,
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; he died.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; We have a powerful God.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; He stands for his people.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; He is faithful. And he said,
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; David contin says, "God alter his voice,
[1:08:38] the earth melted. When God speaks,
[1:08:41] everything moves."
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "Let there be light."

[1:08:58] light.

[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; He will bring everything in position in
[1:09:03] order
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; by the power of the spoken word. He has
[1:09:07] already said it.

[1:09:31] "No, I don't know what happened." Some
[1:09:32] God start opening the door because there
[1:09:34] is a father that is believing. Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; God can open your situation tonight,
[1:09:40] this morning,
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; if you only believe.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You know, I came here for for a revival.
[1:09:45] You know,
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I woke up this morning. I said, Lord,
[1:09:47] what do you have?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm here to have church. If you
[1:09:50] don't want to, I will have it.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; It says, "Be still and know that I am
[1:09:56] God."
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Don't, in other words, stop fearing.
[1:09:59] Stop fighting.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Stop worrying.
[1:10:03] No means to recognize
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; and to understand he is he should be
[1:10:08] exalted over all nations
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; be still
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; send come don't shake don't worry
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; and know recognize
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; believe
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; get to understand that this God that we
[1:10:24] have oh my goodness
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; he will be the one being exalted
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; in the midst of your situation
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; and one Hey,
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; our Lord was tired on the boat. I
[1:10:34] haven't even touched my sermon yet.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; It's okay if I don't touch it. That's
[1:10:38] okay.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He was tired after a long sermon.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; He's coming there and his disciple got
[1:10:44] on board and then you know and Satan
[1:10:47] looked and said, "No, today I'm going to
[1:10:48] kill this guy. He's sleeping." He
[1:10:50] thought he was just a normal man. He of
[1:10:52] course he was a man
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; but a different type of man.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; It was 100% man and 100% God.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; But he was tired. Second look, oh he's
[1:11:02] tired like the rest of the common people
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; but they didn't know no dity was there.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; The body was sleeping but God was not
[1:11:09] sleeping.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; You you see that that's the problem that
[1:11:12] we having.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; The demon comes at night says you know
[1:11:15] why this man is sleeping. They don't
[1:11:17] know that dates in me. He's not
[1:11:18] sleeping.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; There's a wicked standing and the angel
[1:11:21] of God are there standing ready with the
[1:11:24] sword.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You must know that there
[1:11:29] are angel that encampeth around you.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; You are here because God did not allow
[1:11:35] the demon to touch you.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; If he let loose, he just let his hand.
[1:11:40] Something will happen to you.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; But God says no.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; He He has to be in church today.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Today is the day.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; He He has to hear these things.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; He has to get this blessing.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; God has to open a certain door for this
[1:11:54] person.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; This is your day.
[1:11:57] And one day he was he was there
[1:11:59] sleeping.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; When they enter into the boat, he never
[1:12:02] promised his disciple there's not going
[1:12:04] to be a storm.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right? We're reading the Bible,
[1:12:07] right?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Did he tell them, "Oh, be careful.
[1:12:10] There's going to be a storm. Maybe
[1:12:11] second, you know."
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; the disciples say, "Here we are with the
[1:12:15] Lord. Let's just get in."
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; That's why all of us have come this
[1:12:19] morning. We're just getting into the
[1:12:20] boats. You know,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; but we here.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; They went there. Oh, thank you.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Got into the boat. He never told them
[1:12:28] there's going to be a a storm in your
[1:12:30] life. He never told you there's going to
[1:12:31] be disappointment.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; He never told you that your children
[1:12:34] will go away.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; He never told you that your marriage
[1:12:37] will have a problem.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; When you got married, you know, you get
[1:12:40] married to your wife, all is well.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Everything is fine. But he never told
[1:12:44] you what will happen down the line.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; For those that are getting married, they
[1:12:49] think like, okay, everything will be
[1:12:50] just flying ease. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; There are something that is ahead. Yeah.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's true.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I have the responsibility to say the
[1:12:59] truth.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; He never promised there's going to be no
[1:13:05] disappointment, no rejection, no
[1:13:07] affliction, no sickness, no trials,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; no headache, no challenges.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; He never told you that.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; But he is in the boat.
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; That's what matters.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; As long as he's there, that's we talked
[1:13:22] about being present, right? So if he is
[1:13:24] present in that boat then that's a
[1:13:25] different situation.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; You need to check if Jesus in your boat
[1:13:28] that's all.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; So if he is there don't worry about it.
[1:13:31] Just do your thing.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Do your thing. He is your boat.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; He has to be in your marriage.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; If if he isn't there don't worry about
[1:13:41] the it will get dark but listen he he is
[1:13:44] in the boat.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In this church we have to
[1:13:48] make sure that he is in the church.
[1:13:49] Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; If he is present the rest of the
[1:13:52] situation, don't worry about it.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Keep walking.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; The King of glory was in that side of
[1:14:06] that boat. And when trouble came,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; what they had to do is to awaken Jesus.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus is sleeping.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You must just awake him
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; because your situation will never change
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; until you awake him.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; You see the first point, make sure he is
[1:14:28] in the boat.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; But go a and wake him.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Go and say, "Hey, Jesus, we're going to
[1:14:34] die. Please wake up." Now, they were
[1:14:37] sleeping.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Then he spoke to the storm.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You see that part of God there? Amen.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Spoke to the soul.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Do you know that that what was in Jesus
[1:14:52] Christ?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Everything that was in Jesus Christ, let
[1:14:58] me put it that way.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Is inside of his church.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Is that a word?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Is that a word?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; dity
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; is not in heaven.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; is in the midst of his church
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; the true believer,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:27] Ghost
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; have dy in them
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; at this m I'm not talking about
[1:15:32] tomorrow.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about now.
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:40] Oh my. I feel like there are some people
[1:15:41] that not believing this.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; This is the word.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Ye are gods."
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing I can I can't give
[1:15:50] you many. Let me help you with that one.
[1:15:51] Amen.
[1:15:53] [Applause]
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; good.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; The one that is inside of you
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; is the one that created the heaven and
[1:16:09] earth.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; All the galaxies.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Because God works in humility.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; You see, that's one of the principle you
[1:16:18] must know about our God. When we pray
[1:16:20] God, we think like, "Oh my goodness,
[1:16:21] it's big."
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; He can actually turn his sin.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; He can. The brother says, "God has the
[1:16:32] desire
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; to even to dwell inside of the worst
[1:16:36] prostitute in town."
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; What? Watch this.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; God want is somebody's heart.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; That is willing to condescend as low as
[1:16:48] men. Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; To say I want to save you
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to live glory
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; everything and I will come down and say
[1:16:58] I want to come into your heart
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; if tonight to this morning you have the
[1:17:03] desire to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; It's not just your desire.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; God want to enter.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; He has promised to get inside of your
[1:17:16] heart. Even if you don't want it, he's
[1:17:17] after you. I want to give you that Holy
[1:17:19] Spirit.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But you just have to ask him.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Psalm 33:6, the word of the Lord.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; By the word of the Lord with the
[1:17:30] heavens, and the host of them by the
[1:17:33] breath of go of the of his mouth.
[1:17:36] He gathered the waters of the sea
[1:17:38] together. As a heap, he laid up the deep
[1:17:40] in the storehouse.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all
[1:17:44] the inhabitants of the the world stand
[1:17:46] in awe of him. He spake and it was done.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; He commanded and he stood fast.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; The Lord bringeth the counsel of the
[1:17:55] hidden to none.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; He maketh the device of the people of
[1:17:59] none effect.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; The counsel of the Lord shall stand
[1:18:02] forever.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; The thought of his heart to all
[1:18:05] generations.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; So if God taught it,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; My prophet said it.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; God thought must be expressed. What is
[1:18:17] the word of God? Is the dots expressed?
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; So if you were part of him in his
[1:18:25] thoughts.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; What do you expect? You're going to be
[1:18:28] here.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; You would do what he intended you to do
[1:18:32] when you were yet in his thought.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; So if you are believing the word of God
[1:18:37] today, means there in his mind, he knew
[1:18:40] that you will believe it.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; saints. This is the power of this
[1:18:45] message. Amen.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; If God did not send a prophet will be in
[1:18:50] confusion.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; We must come to that place to realize
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; that our God is able.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; So my word Isaiah 55 11.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; So my word be that goeth forth out of my
[1:19:05] mouth, it shall not return unto me void.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; He shall accomplish that which I please
[1:19:11] and shall prosper in the things there
[1:19:13] to.
[1:19:15] Amen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; So the word of God,
[1:19:19] you know, in the book of Psalms here,
[1:19:23] even Hebrew chapter 4, it says the word,
[1:19:26] Hebrew 4:12, for the word of God is
[1:19:30] quicker and powerful.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; That and sharper than any two-edged
[1:19:36] sword,
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; pursing even to the dividing ascend of
[1:19:40] the soul and spirit
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; and the join and marrow and is the
[1:19:44] discerner. It's a discerner
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; of the thoughts and intent of the heart.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; So even if you have an intention,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; the word of God can go deep inside of
[1:19:56] your heart and deal with that situation.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have done something in secret
[1:20:03] that nobody knows about.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; When the word of God comes at the
[1:20:07] pulpit, it goes down there into that
[1:20:10] that that area that you're trying to
[1:20:12] hide. Nobody knows about it. I'm gonna
[1:20:14] die with this.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; The word of God can go that deep.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; We can hide things from one another, but
[1:20:25] the word of God
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; can go deep into that area.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Saint, I want you to catch this because
[1:20:32] we're going to go in that area this
[1:20:33] morning.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:38] because we might actually miss heaven
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; because of that little tiny little bitty
[1:20:43] little thing
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; that is there.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to dig inside
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; just for by the grace of God.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; In Eden, God gave man his word. It was
[1:20:57] his safety. The Bible says in Proverbs
[1:21:00] said, "Every word of God is pure. He is
[1:21:03] a shield unto them that put their trust
[1:21:06] in him.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; In Eden, God gave them the word.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; We just read it. Is that right?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; God gave them the word. It says out of
[1:21:16] all the tree,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; There's only a tree there you should not
[1:21:21] eat. Is that right?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:21:25] the word of God was a safety boundary.
[1:21:28] Mhm.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; You see, it's a place where you are
[1:21:32] protected. It's like your children. You
[1:21:33] keep them on the fence, right? Just
[1:21:34] making sure that they don't go outside.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; As long as they were there, nothing
[1:21:39] could happen to them.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; But Satan came in the midst.
[1:21:45] That serpent came.
[1:21:47] The serpent is How many of us know that
[1:21:50] the serpent was an upright beast?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; It could speak,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; It could talk. For the matter of fact,
[1:21:58] he could have children.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Are we message believers?
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Because if we go deeper, I don't want to
[1:22:12] slow down and start looking at the
[1:22:13] scriptures, but we're not going to we're
[1:22:15] going to waste time here. Uh, brother,
[1:22:17] can you give me Genesis chapter 2:15?
[1:22:21] And the Lord took the man and put him
[1:22:23] into the Garden of Eden to dress it and
[1:22:25] to keep it. And the Lord God commanded
[1:22:27] men, saying, "Every tree of the garden,
[1:22:31] thou may freely eat, but of the tree of
[1:22:33] knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
[1:22:35] not eat it." Is that right?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Is it clear? Right.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; God says, "Do not eat it."
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; You can eat all all of them. There's a
[1:22:45] lot of them. There were four kinds,
[1:22:46] right? Good for the eyes, good for food,
[1:22:50] the tree of life,
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; and the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:22:52] and evil.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; You can read it. I won't have time to
[1:22:54] read it. It's there. But the enemy came
[1:22:59] because this enemy that came into the
[1:23:01] saints, don't don't miss this. Very
[1:23:03] important. Please, somebody is sleeping,
[1:23:05] you shake them and say, "Hey, something
[1:23:07] they it's happening."
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Now, God told them not to eat. He says
[1:23:12] the day that you eat it, you will die.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; And Satan came and took that body, the
[1:23:18] body of that beast
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; because Lucifer was the one that was in
[1:23:23] heaven. Is that right?
[1:23:24] cast down because of disobedience,
[1:23:26] right? Came on earth, but his spirit,
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; he has to find a body.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; He cannot dwell in a man. He has to use
[1:23:32] a beast.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Watch this very important principle
[1:23:35] there.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Satan uses a beast to enter.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Very important. That's why they went
[1:23:43] into, you know, when the the the spirits
[1:23:46] were cast out of the men from Ga Gada,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; they went into the
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; the swines
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; because Satan love to enter into
[1:23:54] animals. If you need a quote, I can send
[1:23:56] it to you. Brother said
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; when he came
[1:24:01] in the garden of Eden, watch this. He
[1:24:04] never forced them.
[1:24:08] I want you to catch this. This is the
[1:24:10] way Satan comes.
[1:24:13] Yes.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm digging into things that we must
[1:24:17] understand.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; God, Satan, sorry, let me put this.
[1:24:21] Satan does not force you.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; That's the first element you should know
[1:24:28] about Satan.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He did not force Eve,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; but he only twisted the word. Yes.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to catch this.
[1:24:43] Satan can just twist something
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; and he already gotten you.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Let's read it together here.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; He did not force her. He used deception
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; to cause Eve to reason with what God
[1:25:01] said.
[1:25:04] God said you shall not eat.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; It's clear.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; But watch one element here. Deception.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis chapter 31.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; How many of us are happy to be in the
[1:25:23] house of the Lord?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Please don't you shouldn't we shouldn't
[1:25:27] sleep. If you have your Bible, you know,
[1:25:30] let I think it's good also for all the
[1:25:31] young people, all of us, you know, we
[1:25:33] need to catch this. I think as I was
[1:25:35] reading, it was a blessing to me.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Now, the serpent
[1:25:40] was the most subtle
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; than any beast of the field which the
[1:25:48] Lord God had made.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to focus on this word here,
[1:25:53] saddle.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Sadd.
[1:25:57] Mhm.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Having a certain wisdom, smart, crafty.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, brother Benam says in
[1:26:04] Hebrew, they use the word maha in
[1:26:07] Hebrew. Maha. You can read it in the
[1:26:10] message, the serpent seed. But Benham
[1:26:12] says something. He says maha means
[1:26:16] having a true knowledge of the
[1:26:19] principles of life.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Can I continue again? Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; I'll repeat that again. A having a true
[1:26:30] knowledge
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; of the principle of life. So he knows
[1:26:34] how life goes.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; He knows how the body of a woman is. He
[1:26:39] knows how the body of man is. He knows
[1:26:41] all of that. He knows that. He knows the
[1:26:44] principle of life.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And he said unto the woman, "Yay,
[1:26:54] as God said," you see something wrong
[1:26:57] there?
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; God had already said something.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Is somebody catching this?
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Are we reading it together?
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Has God said, "Can you imagine you're
[1:27:11] standing in front of somebody, they
[1:27:12] already told you something,
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; but did you really No, you heard me.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; You heard me. Has
[1:27:19] God said, "Ye shall not eat of every
[1:27:22] tree of the garden." That's that's the
[1:27:24] only conversation you got.
[1:27:32] The woman said unto the serpent, "Yeah,
[1:27:35] we may eat of the fruit of the tree of
[1:27:36] the garden, but the fruit of of the tree
[1:27:39] which is in the midst of the garden, God
[1:27:41] said, has said, you shall not eat of it,
[1:27:44] neither shall ye touch it, lest we die."
[1:27:47] Is that a scripture?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Is it what God said? Yeah.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; For a matter of fact,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; when Eve said it, God told Adam, God
[1:27:56] told the man of this commandment.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; So if Eve was able to quote that to the
[1:28:02] serpent, means that she might have heard
[1:28:03] it from Adam. From the
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Did she quote the scripture?
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:10] But watch say that.
[1:28:14] And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye
[1:28:17] shall not
[1:28:20] surely die."
[1:28:22] That's it.
[1:28:26] So N
[1:28:28] is the only thing.
[1:28:31] God said that that that
[1:28:35] you said that to that. Totally
[1:28:38] different. He didn't say that. He did
[1:28:41] not say that you shall not surely die.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; He said you shall surely die.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's what God said.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; So when the enemy comes,
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; don't allow him to reason with you.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; You just tell him what the word said and
[1:28:56] walk away.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; But as soon as you start thinking, "Oh,
[1:29:02] really?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Did he really mean it?"
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:29:07] Because at that moment you reasoning
[1:29:09] with the word
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; and that's what Eve did.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; She reasoned the day she open her ear.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; She reasoned with the word and then that
[1:29:19] was it.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; For God doeth no that in the day he eats
[1:29:28] there off. Now he adds a little bit more
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; in a formation that was not what God
[1:29:34] gave them.
[1:29:37] Because you you you actually
[1:29:41] inject a certain wisdom
[1:29:43] and then wait the person start
[1:29:45] reasoning. You stop adding information
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; then what God did not say.
[1:29:50] [Music]
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Can we continue? Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; For God knoweth that in the day you eat
[1:30:02] thereof, then your eyes shall be open,
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
[1:30:12] and evil,
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; but they were already gods.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; So once you don't know who you are,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:30:27] So you are a Christian, the devil come
[1:30:29] and say, "Are you really a Christian?"
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; You start thinking, say, "Whoa, I was a
[1:30:33] Christian before the foundation of the
[1:30:34] world.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; You must know who you are."
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; They were already there.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; But Satan had an information that was
[1:30:45] not even needed.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And that's where Eve dropped all the
[1:30:49] barrier and Satan came in.
[1:30:57] Now I want you to catch this Satan
[1:30:59] wisdom
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; how it works before I stop flying a
[1:31:03] little fast. Is that okay?
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; How many of us love the Lord?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:31:12] Six. When the woman saw
[1:31:19] that the tree was good for food,
[1:31:23] now you need to watch the language here.
[1:31:26] It was not an apple. Let me say it from
[1:31:28] the beginning. The year
[1:31:31] you will say, "Oh, brother, but it says
[1:31:34] good for food."
[1:31:37] There were four kinds of trees in the
[1:31:38] garden.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; So, if you watch that trend, you'll
[1:31:41] figure it out why. Because the Bible
[1:31:44] says it's like a way of an adulterous
[1:31:46] woman.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; She eateth and say and wiper her mouth
[1:31:50] and say I have not eaten.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; So that eating that eating is not the
[1:31:55] eating of food.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That's what we need in Malachi 4.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Now and that was pleasant to the eye.
[1:32:07] Watch this. and a tree to be desired to
[1:32:12] make one what?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Wise.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; That wisdom is not God wisdom.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham says those three
[1:32:21] elements was the three assaults
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; that Jesus encountered in Ma in Matthew
[1:32:26] chapter 4.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Satan brought him this very same three
[1:32:30] things. You know how Jesus overcome it?
[1:32:32] By the word.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; You see you you catching this? Maybe
[1:32:38] maybe down the line we'll talk about
[1:32:40] that. But let's go to the book of James.
[1:32:42] James chapter 3:15. I need to go faster,
[1:32:45] right? Otherwise, we'll sleep here.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; James 3:15. The the wisdom
[1:32:51] descendeth not from above,
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; but but is earthly,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; sensual.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Use this word very carefully here.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Sensual and devilish.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:07] So the wisdom of Satan
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; is to to to to begal you.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Now watch when God came down and said
[1:33:16] what what did you guys do? Right.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; If said the serpent begal me.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; That word begal means to lure
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; to seduce.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; How can you seduce something to eat
[1:33:28] food?
[1:33:34] God wisdom is to stay with the word.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Satan wisdom is to twist it to make it
[1:33:41] say something that it does not say.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Anything that is not part of God
[1:33:46] original thought is a perversion.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Satan does not create. You have to
[1:33:53] understand these principles.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Satan does not create. He cannot create
[1:33:57] otherwise you'll be God.
[1:34:00] Oh my goodness. I want to enter into
[1:34:01] something I'm going to hold myself. So,
[1:34:04] Satan does not create. He only perverts
[1:34:07] what God creates.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; You know the Satan and Lucif God and and
[1:34:13] Lucifer were very close, right?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the only thing was that
[1:34:20] Lucifer could not create.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; They were very close. But the only
[1:34:28] element there was creation.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; I can't go deep into that, but I I'll
[1:34:35] hold it.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Sin is a perver the perversion of
[1:34:40] righteousness.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; What is adultery? Is a perversion of the
[1:34:45] right act.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; What is a lie?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Is the truth
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; perverted?
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So everything that you see here,
[1:34:55] it's a perversion of something else
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; of the original one.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot create, but he can only
[1:35:03] twist and pervert it.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; And if he perverts it, then your mind
[1:35:07] goes there and you start going crazy.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And out of that union between Eve and
[1:35:16] the serpent
[1:35:18] came out Cain.
[1:35:20] Let's go to first John chapter 3:15.
[1:35:24] Not as Cain who was No, let's let's read
[1:35:28] the first.
[1:35:31] Amen. We can go faster. So we we go
[1:35:33] faster here. Okay.
[1:35:36] First John chapter 3:15.
[1:35:39] First John 3:15.
[1:35:46] Is that right?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; 1 John 3:15.
[1:35:54] Maybe
[1:35:57] first John 3 oh sorry two 3:12
[1:36:01] I don't know how 15 I say 15 so it's 12
[1:36:04] here not as king who was of what
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; that wicked one
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; that slew his brother wherefore slew he
[1:36:14] him because his own work were evil and
[1:36:16] his brother righteousness
[1:36:19] The Bible says here it was of that
[1:36:21] wicked one.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; That wicked one was not hidden.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; The first quote exposition of the church
[1:36:29] age. The first quote there. Did you get
[1:36:32] it? Now these are two twins again. These
[1:36:36] are two tree again growing side by side
[1:36:40] in the earth. the same earth,
[1:36:44] partaking of the same nourishment,
[1:36:46] drinking in in some rain and
[1:36:48] beneficiaring by the by the same son,
[1:36:50] but they come from a different seed.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; One tree is for the word of from the for
[1:36:56] the word of God and exactly as God gave
[1:36:59] it. Love and obey it. The other tree is
[1:37:02] from the seed of the enter the word of
[1:37:05] God and change it where he wants to. He
[1:37:09] substituted his own creed and dogma for
[1:37:12] living true for living the true word of
[1:37:14] of God exactly as Cain and did Cain
[1:37:18] rather who ended up killing Abel. But
[1:37:22] fear not little flock. Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Fear not little flock. Stay with the
[1:37:28] word.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Keep that word between you what? And the
[1:37:31] devil.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; If did not do that she failed. And when
[1:37:36] the church let down on the word, she
[1:37:39] goes into the depths of darkness of
[1:37:42] what? Of Satan.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Every time that we go away, we think we
[1:37:49] reason. That's it. We under the control
[1:37:51] of Satan.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible says 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:37:55] 1:20, "Where is the wise? Where is the
[1:37:57] scribe? Where is the dispute of the
[1:37:59] world? Has not God made foolish the
[1:38:02] wisdom of the world?"
[1:38:04] It contin says, "For after that in the
[1:38:06] wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew
[1:38:08] him not know knew not God. He pleased
[1:38:12] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[1:38:14] save them that believe."
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe it?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3:15, "Let no man deceives
[1:38:21] himself. If any man among you seems to
[1:38:24] be wise in the world, let him become a
[1:38:26] fool
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; that he may be wise." The wisdom of this
[1:38:30] world, watch this, the wisdom of this
[1:38:33] world is foolish, foolishness with God.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; For it is written, it taketh the wise in
[1:38:37] their own craft craftiness. And again,
[1:38:40] the Lord knoweth the thought or what of
[1:38:42] the wise, and they are vain.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; You hear people say, "Wow, I'm very
[1:38:48] smart. I'm very wise."
[1:38:54] But after that from that union
[1:38:57] came out Cain right Genesis 2:15
[1:39:02] God told Adam to tilt the soil right you
[1:39:05] can find it there
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; is to cultivate it right and you would
[1:39:08] watch that in the action of Adam his
[1:39:10] seed would do the same thing you know
[1:39:12] Seth will also you know kind of getting
[1:39:15] into agriculture right and of course
[1:39:17] still having you know in the
[1:39:19] civilization of faith in terms of like
[1:39:21] they will believe God like Abel did. Is
[1:39:23] that right?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; But of Cain they chose something quite
[1:39:26] different in Genesis chapter 4:15 4:16
[1:39:30] and Cain after he had killed Abel
[1:39:34] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:39:36] Lord and dwelt in the land of Nad and
[1:39:38] the east of Eden and Cain knew his wife
[1:39:41] and she conceived and be Anosh and he
[1:39:44] built a city. So from the lineage of
[1:39:48] Seth we have agriculture. They focus
[1:39:51] more on agriculture. They were more on
[1:39:52] the agricultural civilization. On the
[1:39:55] other side of of of Cain, they were
[1:39:57] building buildings.
[1:39:59] You see that?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; That's actually approximately 2,000
[1:40:03] years getting closer to Noah. Are you
[1:40:04] are you with me?
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Oh no. I mean after Adam. So we can't
[1:40:08] trust Cain first in Genesis chapter
[1:40:11] 4:16.
[1:40:12] Are you with me?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; And Cain went out of the presence of the
[1:40:17] Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod. I
[1:40:19] think I just read it. Right.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Verse 17 now.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And Cain knew his wife. Oh, I think
[1:40:25] let's go to 18.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; And unto Okay, let me read it. Unto
[1:40:30] Anoch was born Aaron. And Aaron begat
[1:40:34] Jehel. And Jerusale began Mashusel. And
[1:40:37] Mashia beg Lamech. Right. Continue.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; And Lamech took unto him to wife. This
[1:40:44] is the introduction of polygamy.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; It's not coming from the lineage of God
[1:40:51] people.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; This is coming from the children of of
[1:40:55] Kane
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; because it's the guy who introduced
[1:40:57] polygamy here.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Lamech took unto him two wives. The name
[1:41:05] of one was Adam and the name of the
[1:41:07] other was Zilah. Let's continue. And and
[1:41:11] Adam b Jabel. He was the father of such
[1:41:14] as dwell in tent and such as of cattle.
[1:41:17] Is that right?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; And his brother's name was Juba. He was
[1:41:22] the father of all such of what handle
[1:41:25] the AR and the organ.
[1:41:28] So all the musician
[1:41:32] because the first one was more into
[1:41:34] business the stuff like that. This one
[1:41:36] is showing up with music and stuff. My
[1:41:38] goodness. Let's continue. And Zilla,
[1:41:42] she also bear tuba an instructor of all
[1:41:47] of every artificial in brass and iron.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You you catch this right?
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. And the sister to was uh
[1:41:58] toain was uh nema.
[1:42:02] Is that right?
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Now you see from the lineage of Seth,
[1:42:05] the more into agriculture. Is that
[1:42:07] right? Now because Adam was tilted the
[1:42:10] soil and all of it in the other side we
[1:42:12] having men that are more into hey let's
[1:42:15] build city
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; let's build towers let's do this
[1:42:18] artificial music and all you watch that
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; now I want you to trace every line of
[1:42:23] both of them separated
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; because we're getting somewhere
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; he will trace it he will bring us to
[1:42:28] today
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible does not lie
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; you know I was reading this I was
[1:42:36] sitting there say oh my goodness Lord
[1:42:37] help me
[1:42:40] Let's read the message the ark
[1:42:44] but says this
[1:42:47] but if you notice there come a great
[1:42:49] civilization through that what the
[1:42:51] lineage of what of came are you with me
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; back there that begin to come in and
[1:42:57] when the men begin to multiply they
[1:42:58] begin to go out after different
[1:43:00] education
[1:43:02] and so forth and discover the things
[1:43:04] what inventions
[1:43:06] one great worker of wood. How they build
[1:43:09] big build uh uh begin to build and build
[1:43:11] and build and build that I mean was a
[1:43:14] sign of what?
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Of the end time.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; All of these things was the sign of the
[1:43:22] end time.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; So when you saying city cities being
[1:43:26] built and all of it, it's a sign.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Is that a prophet? Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Did you ever see like a building that
[1:43:33] got now it's again the sign of what the
[1:43:37] end time
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; they got great work of metals they
[1:43:41] discovered how they could and what they
[1:43:44] could do with metals. This was before
[1:43:46] the antivian destruction.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; So sometime we have big building we
[1:43:52] think like we got it. No,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; before
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; before the destruction or before the
[1:43:57] flood,
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; these people were even stronger than us.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; They had more technology that we got.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's continue.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. See
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; the next paragraph. Let's continue. Yes.
[1:44:12] And look what they're doing with the
[1:44:13] metal today. Even making I heard on the
[1:44:16] radio the other day making steel and
[1:44:18] metal houses. They cut all the timber
[1:44:20] practically so that they make them out
[1:44:23] of aluminum and and of steel and and so
[1:44:25] forth. Great discoveries of education
[1:44:28] and great going of science, progress of
[1:44:31] science, a sign of the end time.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Look what science has done in the last
[1:44:39] few years. Just the things that they
[1:44:41] done. What is it? Nearing the end time.
[1:44:45] A sign that that all believer watch
[1:44:48] this. That's when the minister come
[1:44:49] around.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Minister in the pulpit should be
[1:44:52] preaching it with all force
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; the God showing to the people.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; You see we have a responsibility
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; showing to the people we are passing
[1:45:05] milestone
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; and all things point to the end.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] So everything that we dealing with with
[1:45:17] everything that we did it's not new.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; The civilization before the flood was
[1:45:24] highly advanced.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; The the might have harnessed
[1:45:31] atomic and electrostatic
[1:45:33] energy in a destructive way.
[1:45:38] Satan and engineers if we have engineers
[1:45:40] in in in the room right now would figure
[1:45:42] it out. That's true.
[1:45:43] So if you have metal, you have all of
[1:45:45] these things is easily easy to make an
[1:45:49] atomic
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; bomb.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; How they were able to make pyramid,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; sphinxes, how they were able to do it,
[1:45:57] but we cannot do it today.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; They they had atomic power to do it.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham talks about it.
[1:46:05] Let's read it.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Perseverance.
[1:46:08] It says Noah was living in a scientific
[1:46:11] age when the world was perhaps could
[1:46:14] shoot the moon with a rod with radar.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Is it a prophet?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Is it a prophet?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the prophet? Right.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Here it is. It says Jesus said it was a
[1:46:27] day like this.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; As it was in the day what? Of Noah.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; So shall it be in the coming of what?
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Referring to what? this time.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Now we know down in Egypt we see the
[1:46:42] pyramid. They could not reproduce them
[1:46:44] today. We have no power to do that.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; They had a hold of what? Atomic power
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; or something of power that building you
[1:46:55] know built the pyramid. We could put
[1:46:58] those border up there by no mean.
[1:47:01] Neither could we produce that fixes.
[1:47:04] There is no way to do in of doing it. We
[1:47:07] don't have the material to make a mommy
[1:47:10] on a body that will look even natural
[1:47:12] for thousands of years.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; We've lost that art.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; They die that won't fade out. Many
[1:47:22] things that they had then that we are
[1:47:25] are completely blind off and they build
[1:47:27] that pyramid so setting so centered in
[1:47:30] the earth. No matter where the sun is,
[1:47:32] there's is never a shadow around it. Is
[1:47:35] that right? How many of us have seen a
[1:47:37] pyramid?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Hey, nobody have seen the pyramid.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm talking even in the picture.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, people.
[1:47:47] At least at least at least in the
[1:47:48] picture, brother. Cuz everybody went
[1:47:50] quiet. I'm like,
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; all right, that's a good one.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my my Where was that?
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Right here. Right. Oh, the art
[1:48:06] that
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you. The instrument they
[1:48:09] had is far beyond now. Is that right?
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; People had abused knowledge and power.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; That might have caused the shift of the
[1:48:21] some techni technonic plates that caused
[1:48:24] the flood
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; because from Adam, if you calculate to
[1:48:29] Noah approximately is 2,000 years ago.
[1:48:32] 2,000 years and every 2,000 years there
[1:48:35] is something major that has to happen.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; And people had become so smart
[1:48:42] that destruction
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; was right there. They stopped playing.
[1:48:46] Brother even says men stop playing in
[1:48:49] God laboratory.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; They start doing things to destroy
[1:48:54] themsel.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; So you see what is happening today. It's
[1:48:57] not a new saint.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Look at the evasion. Look at whatever
[1:49:01] people are digging oil and all of these
[1:49:03] things.
[1:49:05] There is it's it's unbing
[1:49:07] destruction in the earth. You don't even
[1:49:09] know
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; we are at the end saints.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; If you don't know that the world is
[1:49:18] falling apart,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; everything around us are falling apart.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; That's why we must seek a kingdom that
[1:49:26] cannot be shaken.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; See, that's my title. Now,
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; we must receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:49:35] shaken
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; because everything is shaking.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; In the time of Noah, everything was
[1:49:40] shaking.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:44] In another quote here birth pain
[1:49:48] people's science has brought into a
[1:49:50] great laboratory
[1:49:52] into God's great laboratory
[1:49:55] until they are going to destroy what
[1:49:58] themselves.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; God let always let wisdom destroy
[1:50:04] himself.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; God does not destroy anything.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; It says men destroy himself by what?
[1:50:11] Wisdom.
[1:50:14] And that wisdom is not of God.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Is the work of Satan.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; So if Cain had the seed of Satan in him,
[1:50:23] he had to produce the very thing that
[1:50:25] was Satan
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; of Satan
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; which include destruction.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; As he did what?
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Taking Satan wisdom instead of what?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Can you see that?
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; The world falling apart. When the world
[1:50:42] is falling apart in the time of Noah,
[1:50:45] God sent them a what? A mighty prophet.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; What did it do?
[1:50:52] They turned it down.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; So what the end was coming, God sent
[1:50:58] them Noah. Are you with me?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; God sent them Noah with a message,
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; but they turned it down.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; God can do nothing.
[1:51:12] without revealing his secret.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; To his servant, the prophet.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amos chapter 3:7.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And the Lord, you know, 1st Samuel 3:21,
[1:51:23] if we can post that, that scripture
[1:51:24] really helped me.
[1:51:27] 1st Samuel 3:21.
[1:51:33] 1st Samuel 3:21. The Lord, watch this.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord appeared again in Shiloh. You
[1:51:41] see that?
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; For the Lord revealed himself.
[1:51:48] Watch this. The For the Lord revealed
[1:51:52] himself to Samuel in Shiloh
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; by the word of the Lord.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[1:52:04] So God gives his word to a prophet. He
[1:52:08] reveal himself by the word to a prophet.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; And the prophet has to speak the word to
[1:52:14] the people.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing that?
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh in Jesus.
[1:52:21] Are you with me?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; And I'm bringing another principle here.
[1:52:24] John chapter 1. In the beginning was the
[1:52:26] word. The word was with God. The word
[1:52:28] was what? was God.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; And John 1 verse 15 14 the word was made
[1:52:35] flesh in Jesus. Is that right?
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Now if you you notice Jesus as he was
[1:52:41] coming to John John the Baptist
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; the word which was Jesus in flesh
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; had to go to a prophet.
[1:52:50] Now watch let's read it together.
[1:52:54] Matthew chapter 3:15.
[1:52:56] Then come Jesus from Galilee to Jordan
[1:52:59] unto John to be baptized. But John for
[1:53:03] forbade him saying, I I have need to be
[1:53:06] baptized of thee.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Cometh thou to me? Okay. And comest thou
[1:53:12] to me as a question, right? And Jesus
[1:53:15] answering said unto him, suffer it not
[1:53:18] to be so. For thus it cometh becometh us
[1:53:24] to fulfill all righteousness.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; The word that was the word that was made
[1:53:29] flesh
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; had to come to a prophet.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; You you got that principle
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; is the same principle.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; The word of God comes to a prophet to
[1:53:41] fulfill all righteousness.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; And here you watch this. Jesus come John
[1:53:46] says no you are the one that need to
[1:53:48] baptize me. Jesus said no, he can't
[1:53:50] break the word.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; The word must come to a prophet.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; So s is the same thing the revealed word
[1:53:58] for this day.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the word made flesh had to
[1:54:02] come to you.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; He had to come had to be revealed to a
[1:54:07] prophet and the prophet had to speak the
[1:54:09] word.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; It's the same principle.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; It's the same principle.
[1:54:18] The word comes only to a prophet,
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; not to an evangelist or a pastor or
[1:54:23] anybody.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord for such age as
[1:54:26] this
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; only come to a prophet.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; You see somebody, you say, "Oh, you
[1:54:34] know, I don't need a prophet. I can just
[1:54:35] read the Bible myself." How can you
[1:54:37] understand this Bible with a prophet?
[1:54:41] You cannot understand because the a
[1:54:43] prophet is an interpreter of a divine
[1:54:45] word of God.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; He looks at the word, it tells you what
[1:54:49] happened.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; You say but how is it? He says no. For
[1:54:53] example, you come and say the Bible says
[1:54:55] Eve was there. Adam was there when Eve
[1:54:58] ate the fruit. Right? But the bottom
[1:55:01] says Adam was not there
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; because in the morning Eve went with the
[1:55:08] serpent
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; and the evening he went with your
[1:55:11] husband
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; only a prophet can see that
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; said we are privileged in this time that
[1:55:21] we living in.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; That's why we should feed on the word of
[1:55:25] God.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; It will solve all our problems around.
[1:55:29] Amen.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Quote chapter six. Remember every
[1:55:33] falling generation.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Let me let me continue that quote I was
[1:55:39] reading.
[1:55:44] The word of the Lord comes to a prophet
[1:55:46] is the word of God. Again in the time of
[1:55:48] Noah they sent it. Moses time the whole
[1:55:53] system was falling apart. They sent a
[1:55:55] prophet and Elijah in his time the whole
[1:55:57] system was falling apart. They send a
[1:55:59] prophet every time when the word the
[1:56:02] world catch this get into the into
[1:56:05] disguise. They send a prophet. God sent
[1:56:09] a prophet.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; And the next code six it says remember
[1:56:15] every falling generation there's only
[1:56:17] one thing that God can bridge this world
[1:56:20] together. Bridge this world together.
[1:56:23] Is that right?
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; It says that's the word of God. It
[1:56:28] continues. It says, "This word was made
[1:56:31] by the word of God. It's framed together
[1:56:35] by the word of God." That's the only
[1:56:37] thing that will ever keep it together is
[1:56:40] the word of God. For the Hebrews said,
[1:56:43] "We understand that the world will frame
[1:56:45] by the word of God." People doubt the
[1:56:47] word of God and the very the very dirt
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; that you are sitting on
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; is the word of God made manifest.
[1:56:58] The very seat that you are sitting in is
[1:57:02] the word of God made manifest.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; God speak it. And then it has to happen
[1:57:08] because it is the word of God. Even the
[1:57:11] the the the wood that you're sitting on
[1:57:13] the chair,
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; God spoke it.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Everything that is
[1:57:19] around us,
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; it was framed by the word of God. So we
[1:57:24] should not sit and question the word of
[1:57:26] God. The following God gift always find
[1:57:29] the place. The whole creation was lost
[1:57:32] and we just went through in the seven
[1:57:35] seal. See the whole creation was lost.
[1:57:37] Everything was gone. He all belong to
[1:57:40] Satan. But I'm talking now.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; It says he fell.
[1:57:48] Yeah. Because Yeah. Let me let me
[1:57:51] because the same quotes but it continues
[1:57:53] here. It says every government, every
[1:57:56] king, every kingdom controlled by Satan.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; The whole world is controlled and run by
[1:58:04] Satan. Let me continue here. Says every
[1:58:07] person that works in it.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe we say, "Oh, wow. Our government,
[1:58:12] you know, man, this government will be
[1:58:14] better." You know how we do in Africa,
[1:58:15] for instance,
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; we expecting the nef government to come
[1:58:18] and we say, "Wow, things will get
[1:58:20] better."
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Watch what the prophet is saying.
[1:58:24] politics corrupted,
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Democrat, Republican and all is low
[1:58:29] down. What it is, it's a bunch of craft.
[1:58:32] Every person that works in it
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; that's not born again
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; is of the devil.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Are you saying amen?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; The devil says every kingdom in the
[1:58:46] world belong to me
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; and Jesus never debate him with it.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right? The world is controlled
[1:58:53] by what? The devil. And every man that
[1:58:56] works for the government, if he isn't a
[1:58:58] Christian,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; it's of the devil and working for the
[1:59:03] devil.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Is that the word of God?
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; So, we must be very careful.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And the people come, let me drop into
[1:59:15] something here. the level of corruption
[1:59:17] in the time
[1:59:19] of Noah.
[1:59:21] Genesis 6:5 and God saw the weakness of
[1:59:23] men was great in the earth that every
[1:59:25] imagination of the thought of the heart
[1:59:27] was only evil continually.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, the deprivation, the the
[1:59:33] depravity, the intent of the thoughts
[1:59:36] were evil. The imagination, the purpose,
[1:59:39] the desire, sin was no longer occasional
[1:59:43] occasional. It was constant. He had
[1:59:45] become the way of life.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; And what is sin? Sin is just means
[1:59:50] missing the mark.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; It's unbelief.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; People's heart, imagination, desire will
[1:59:58] feel of violence, lust, greed, and all
[2:00:01] rebellious before God.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; You see everything that we seeing on the
[2:00:05] street now, killing and all of it's not
[2:00:07] new.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said as he was in the time of
[2:00:11] Noah, so shall he be. Is that right? And
[2:00:14] that's what we're seeing.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis chapter 6:2. The
[2:00:18] sons of God. Watch this. We're getting
[2:00:20] to something here.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Now, we we talked about the world in
[2:00:26] terms of the earth and all how men is
[2:00:28] distracting, destroying themselves
[2:00:29] through technology and whatnot. Is that
[2:00:31] right? We talked about, you know, uh the
[2:00:35] corruption as well, right?
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; The mind of men. Now, let's dig about
[2:00:39] this. the sons of God. In other words,
[2:00:42] the sons of Seth.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Now, we come into a place where God said
[2:00:49] enough is enough.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the sons of God,
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; the son from the lineage of Seth,
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; not from Cain,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; from the lineage of Seth
[2:01:05] took the daughter of men. Brother says
[2:01:08] they took the the daughter of Cain
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; the sons of God
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; took the daughter of of men that they
[2:01:19] were fair
[2:01:20] woman. Brother Benam another message
[2:01:22] says that's a proof of the end too.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; The beauty everybody want to be
[2:01:26] beautiful.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Now we going on the street there's a lot
[2:01:30] of paint in the face everywhere.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Oh am I saying something wrong here?
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Is it Is it not true? Amen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Because that's a spirit of Jezebel.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; That's a spirit of Jezebel. She's the
[2:01:43] one. That's a hidden thing.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; That's for another day.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Now, the sons of the lineage of Ken took
[2:01:52] the woman, started living with them.
[2:01:57] Are we now seeing it today? Yeah,
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; sons of God, Christians,
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; they will go and say, "Wow, I see this
[2:02:07] beautiful woman.
[2:02:09] Maybe not marry them. Just live with
[2:02:11] them.
[2:02:13] This is the son of the end."
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Saints, if nobody tells us these things,
[2:02:18] tell us these things, we're not we're
[2:02:19] going to leave any type of way.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; But this is the church of the living
[2:02:23] God.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; From this pulpit, the truth must come
[2:02:27] out. Amen.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; And I don't think by the one compromise.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Why would I do it?
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Say that's why we have to repent.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; If it those one did not escape, we will
[2:02:43] not escape.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Do you believe that?
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; It's not to condemn anybody. It's just
[2:02:49] that God need to help us.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. as the church of the living God.
[2:02:54] Even as we standing together, praying
[2:02:56] together
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, help me."
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; That's why we must pray for one another.
[2:03:00] You don't know what your brother's
[2:03:02] dealing with. You don't know what your
[2:03:03] sister's dealing with. Pray for her.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Don't just wait for somebody to happen.
[2:03:07] Then you start, oh, wow. Why did he get
[2:03:08] do why are they doing this?
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; But we spend time to pray for them.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Because the end is coming. You don't
[2:03:16] want this situation to happen. Right.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; There is something that really caught my
[2:03:22] attention here. You would watch when
[2:03:26] Noah because when Noah entered into the
[2:03:29] ark, there were only eight people that
[2:03:31] were saved. Is that right?
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; But you would wonder where are all the
[2:03:36] sons of Sat?
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; I know.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; And I was just reading. I thought about
[2:03:42] it. I said,
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; whoa.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; What about all the lineage of the sons
[2:03:46] of
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Seth?
[2:03:48] only eight.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; That shocked me just for a minute.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; You can say I'm a Christian.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; But how many of us
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; will be there?
[2:04:13] That's what saint where we come into
[2:04:14] church
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; is because we need more of God. It has
[2:04:18] to be a relationship.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Say Lord please help me.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; You crying every day Lord I don't want
[2:04:25] to miss that day. Not out of fear but to
[2:04:27] do something for him. You know you have
[2:04:29] love for God. You don't want to hurt his
[2:04:31] feeling.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Only eight were able to make it.
[2:04:39] My my my Lord have mercy on us.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; You know before Noah, he never rained
[2:04:45] before. Is that right? How many of us
[2:04:46] believe that?
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Genesis 2:5, we can read it.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; No rain before
[2:04:54] and after that he rained.
[2:04:57] The Bible says in Genesis chapter 7:11,
[2:05:00] in the 600 years of Noah's life, the
[2:05:05] second month, the 17th day of the month,
[2:05:08] the same day where all the fountain of
[2:05:10] the deep broke up
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; and the windows of heaven were open, may
[2:05:17] it rain crazy.
[2:05:20] Fellowship
[2:05:24] the message fellowship.
[2:05:27] I'm coming to to close. Is that right?
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord here?
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Right. All of us need
[2:05:33] God's help. Is that right?
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Uh quotes number nine.
[2:05:40] I'm coming there so we can finish here.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. There's a lot going on
[2:05:45] here. All right.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's no
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; nine. Put nine, please.
[2:05:52] Oh, there's no nine. Oh,
[2:05:56] that's fine.
[2:05:59] There's only 10 there. Okay, that's
[2:06:01] fine. I'll read nine. It says now I
[2:06:04] would say as a serving here, I'll say as
[2:06:07] a servant of the Lord, I believe that it
[2:06:09] could happen at any time.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Total annihilation.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; It could start at any time. Look as in
[2:06:18] the day of Noah. That's how they throw
[2:06:21] the world out of it bound in the days of
[2:06:24] Noah when they built pyramid and fines
[2:06:27] and and so forth. They couldn't build it
[2:06:29] today if we had to. Gasoline power,
[2:06:32] electric power won't build it. You see
[2:06:35] that?
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying but the Bible says but
[2:06:38] atomic power will
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; but we don't have atomic power.
[2:06:45] But in that time they were able to have
[2:06:47] it.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; So they could turn it loose. What
[2:06:53] whatever is saying my it says they could
[2:06:56] turn it loose and suck the world from
[2:07:00] its orbit
[2:07:02] and it begins
[2:07:04] went out and caused moisture. Brother is
[2:07:08] telling us what had caused
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; the flood.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; You know, I went down and studied this a
[2:07:16] little bit because I love stuff like
[2:07:18] this. So, I went to study figure it out
[2:07:20] how was it posit possible? I came out to
[2:07:23] find out. Yes, brother is right.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get into it,
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; but he was right.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; let me continue.
[2:07:33] It says, "And Iben Hat went out and
[2:07:36] caused moisture that covered the whole
[2:07:38] earth." It says, "This time is going to
[2:07:42] blow it into the sun."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Just exactly scientifically, right
[2:07:49] across the center, the way God said it,
[2:07:52] it would happen. Here it is. We are at
[2:07:55] the the end time and men are still
[2:07:59] unprepared.
[2:08:04] Saint, as we're sitting here this
[2:08:06] morning,
[2:08:08] there's triggers of atomic bomb in
[2:08:11] people's head.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe we sitting here, we're worshiping.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of things happening
[2:08:16] around the world.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; It would just take one person to press a
[2:08:20] button.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; But for you,
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; you have promised a kingdom.
[2:08:29] The world can shake in destruction,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; but you cannot shake
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; because you are born, we'll get into it.
[2:08:36] You are born into that kingdom
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; that before anything could happen, the
[2:08:42] Lord will take you home.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; God will not allow his elect to go
[2:08:47] through such thing.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; But I'm glad to say
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; when the world was shaking, there was a
[2:08:52] man called Enoch.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; He was the seventh from Adam. He was
[2:08:57] raptured.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, you know, the Bible says
[2:09:01] Enoch walked with God and he was not and
[2:09:04] God took him
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; by faith. Enoch was translated that he
[2:09:09] should not what sit there and was not
[2:09:12] found because God has translated him.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; For before his translation, he had this
[2:09:21] testimony that he pleased God. Amen.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Enoch was the seventh but the but the
[2:09:29] one was reading here. Watch the seven.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; You catch this.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; The seven need to take be taken home.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; The promise of the right is for the
[2:09:38] bride.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Soon enough she'll go home.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; This is the time of the bride. She she
[2:09:46] isn't a civilization of faith.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; She believe all work the whole word of
[2:09:51] God. She's not shaken.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; If God decide for you to die here in a
[2:09:59] moment in the twinkling of the eye
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[2:10:04] sound
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; and the death shall be raised
[2:10:07] incorruptible and we shall be what?
[2:10:10] Changed
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; For the corruptible must put on a
[2:10:16] corruption and the mortal must put on
[2:10:18] immortality. So when the corruptible
[2:10:21] shall have to put on incorrupt
[2:10:23] incorruption, this model shall have to
[2:10:27] put on immortality
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; and then shall
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; to pass the saying that is written
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; death is swallowed up in victory.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4:16,
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; for the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:10:44] heaven
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; with a shout. What is the shout? The
[2:10:47] message.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yes sir.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; The message is coming forth
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; has come forth.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; With the voice of the archangel with the
[2:10:58] trump of God. The death in in Christ
[2:11:01] shall rise first.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; shall be caught up together with them in
[2:11:10] the cloud to meet the Lord in the air.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; So shall we ever be with the Lord.
[2:11:17] Do you believe it?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; There is a promise that belong to you.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; I receive it.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:26,
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; as it was in the day of Noah, so shall
[2:11:28] it be in the day of the son of man.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; They did eat the drunk and the merry
[2:11:33] wives.
[2:11:35] You see that
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; the merry wives they were given in
[2:11:38] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[2:11:42] into the ark the flood came and
[2:11:43] destroyed them all. Likewise also I like
[2:11:48] that
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; it looks like the sim the similar thing
[2:11:52] right
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; but it's there for a purpose.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Likewise also it as it was in the day of
[2:11:59] Lot.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; What happened in the time of Lot?
[2:12:02] Perversion. Right.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what we seeing?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; They did eat. They drunk the they bought
[2:12:12] and and sold it and they planted the
[2:12:14] building. Let's continue.
[2:12:17] But the same day that Lot went out of
[2:12:19] Sodom, he rain fire and bring storm from
[2:12:22] heaven and destroyed them all.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; So if God does not bring destruction for
[2:12:27] this generation, he has to go back and
[2:12:29] repent for this.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; But God cannot repent.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; When brother Brennham was preaching, I
[2:12:38] think the choosing of the bride if I'm
[2:12:41] not mistaken, he spoke about Los
[2:12:43] Angeles.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Said, "Do you remember Pompei, India,
[2:12:47] what happened there?" He says, "You Los
[2:12:49] Angeles, you go down in the sea."
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Saint, we living in the timel
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; we must be prepared.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; As brother Vanam says, there's this all
[2:12:59] this atomic bomb is going around. It
[2:13:01] says people are still unprepared.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; We are still distracted. Oh wow, I have
[2:13:06] to do this. I have to build this big
[2:13:08] house.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; What about our soul?
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; We worry about different things.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Some little bitty things left and right.
[2:13:16] What about your life?
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; What about your relationship with God?
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; The young people, they're looking for
[2:13:23] the next boyfriend.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; The young boys say, "Oh, wow. I want to
[2:13:27] have a beautiful girlfriend.
[2:13:29] It's time to be on your knees and pray
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; because if all our parents all of of our
[2:13:35] parent gone who's going to stand
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; who we even know that there was a man
[2:13:40] called William Brandon
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; sometimes parent don't realize it
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; if we go that our children will know
[2:13:45] what we stood for
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; maybe this church will be closed
[2:13:51] may God have mercy on us
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; may God have mercy on us
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; our young people are dying I know what
[2:13:58] I'm talking about
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; there are things that I'm telling you
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; there's a lot going on
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; there's a lot going on I don't think if
[2:14:08] the parents have an idea what's going on
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; there's quite a lot going on
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; may God awaken our spirit
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; that as we come in here we see Lord I I
[2:14:19] I want to receive that kingdom
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; so that even if I die I know where I'm
[2:14:24] going
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; even if the rapture takes place I know
[2:14:27] where I'm going Amen.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I don't want to just go alone.
[2:14:30] I have my children too.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave anybody behind.
[2:14:34] I'm going to carry with them. So what
[2:14:36] you do, you create an atmosphere that
[2:14:38] not even one of your loved ones
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; will stay behind.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; So if you care about your children,
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; you should fight for them as well.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost in you will not
[2:14:52] allow anybody to go to hell
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; or anybody to be lost.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will do everything in your
[2:14:59] power for that person to be saved.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Then let's do it for our loved ones,
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; for our children,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; our loved ones.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Abraham's group when judgment was
[2:15:12] falling,
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Abraham was not even there. He was
[2:15:15] secure somewhere.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Abraham was secure somewhere.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; He could only hear judgment fire falling
[2:15:24] over there. But Elohim step in human
[2:15:27] flesh.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; He was there talking to Elohim
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Interceding for his brother Lord.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; He was in God.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; He was hidden in God.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; He was protected in God.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; And those of ham as well
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; will be protected.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know I'm speaking a
[2:15:52] different language,
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; but those that will catch you catch it.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; They are protected.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Our father Abraham
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; was looking for a city
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; which has a foundation.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whose builder and mecca is
[2:16:17] God. Amen.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; There's something here I want to read.
[2:16:21] Genesis 18:18. Seeing that Abraham shall
[2:16:24] surely become a great nation. That's God
[2:16:27] Elohim speaking.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; It says, "And all the nation of the
[2:16:31] earth shall be blessed but in him. I
[2:16:33] know him."
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Let post. Let's have
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; For I know him
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; that he will command his children.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his household after him.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; And they shall keep the way of the Lord
[2:16:59] to do justice and judgment that the Lord
[2:17:03] may bring upon Abraham that which he has
[2:17:07] spoken what of him. Not just Abraham, he
[2:17:11] would teach his children.
[2:17:15] You see that
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; if our father Abraham taught his
[2:17:20] children, why are we having a problem as
[2:17:23] sons of Abraham to teach our children?
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Something is wrong somewhere. You you c
[2:17:28] you catching this?
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel were in Egypt.
[2:17:35] They were in a secure place in in Gos.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Darkness was in Egypt. Death was
[2:17:41] striking Egypt.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were under the blood.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; They were protected under the tokens.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; They were citizen of a city
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; which build and make is God.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; They could not be touched.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Even if they were in bondage for many
[2:17:56] years,
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; but yet they were protected.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; God takes care of his children.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; He's a responsible father.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; He's a responsible father. Yes,
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[2:18:11] He was sitting there.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Jezebel came to kill, you know, to kill,
[2:18:15] trying to kill all the prophet and all
[2:18:17] of it.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Elijah was running away from a woman.
[2:18:22] This woman was coming and say, I'm going
[2:18:24] to destroy all the prophet. She brought
[2:18:27] idolatry into Israel. And what you know
[2:18:29] the story, right?
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Then there was something that Elijah
[2:18:33] said here.
[2:18:35] First Kings chapter 19:10. He said, "I
[2:18:38] have been very zealous for the Lord God
[2:18:40] of hosts, and the children of Israel has
[2:18:42] forsaken the covenant. Throw down the
[2:18:44] altar and slay the prophet with the
[2:18:46] sword, and I," Do you see that?
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; I, if I only left, I'm left and they
[2:18:54] seek my life to take it away.
[2:18:57] In verse 18, let's go to 18. Then God
[2:19:00] speaks to Elijah. It says yet
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; I have left
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; me.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Oh glory
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; God would have a remnant.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says, "Yet I have left me
[2:19:22] 7,000 in Israel, all the knees which
[2:19:26] have not bowed unto bear
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; and every mouth which have not kissed
[2:19:32] him.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; If you don't stand, God will have a
[2:19:38] remnant to stand."
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Even if you say, "Oh, I don't care about
[2:19:44] this message."
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; God will have people
[2:19:48] Oh, glory to God.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Man, I don't get what,"
[2:19:53] don't worry about it. God will have his
[2:19:56] people.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; God cannot be stopped because of your
[2:20:00] unbelief. Unbelief does not stop God.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; He's still moving.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; The cloud is still moving.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; The pill of fire is moving.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; And all the children of God are lining
[2:20:13] up looking facing to the word.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; You know a magnet.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; When a magnet is passing around,
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; right? There's plastic and whatn not.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; You can't even find stainless steel.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; When the magnets magnet come, he only
[2:20:32] picked up those that can be magnetized.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Elijah? Elisha,
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; you know, he meets Elisha. Elijah,
[2:20:43] they just talk to him. He says, "Hey,
[2:20:46] wait, wait, wait. Let me let me let me
[2:20:49] leave everything." He didn't even say a
[2:20:51] word.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; He just touched him and he follow him.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Magnet.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; This word is a big magnet.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; You were in the world. You walking any
[2:21:04] type of way. You just hear the oh God
[2:21:06] send a prophet. You say what? You start
[2:21:08] walking
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; without even questioning.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; The word of God is a great magnet
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; and it's coming into this building
[2:21:17] convincing the heart of every one of
[2:21:19] you. It's not me. I'm just a human
[2:21:21] being.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; But the word is bringing conviction into
[2:21:24] your heart.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; God is healing the sick in our midst.
[2:21:34] You don't even feel it.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Can you wake up the sister, please?
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:43] Glory to God.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; In the time of Jesus,
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; the Jews thought that there was a
[2:21:50] kingdom that had to come. Is that right?
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; A great kingdom with a, you know, they
[2:21:56] were expecting a general. Oh no, this
[2:21:58] man will come like Solomon. You know, he
[2:22:00] will bring, you know,
[2:22:03] you know, wealth into this country and
[2:22:05] all. That's what they were thinking.
[2:22:06] That was the conception of how the
[2:22:09] Messiah should come.
[2:22:12] You know, God works in simplicity.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Then we just saw a baby, a baby
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; wrapped in swaddling cloth.
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Jehovah
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; wrapped
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; the the the the one who created
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; the heaven and earth
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; is now on earth
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; condescending to the lowest spot to be a
[2:22:37] baby.
[2:22:40] Hallelujah.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; They were those people of the religious
[2:22:43] men of the day
[2:22:45] were were entangled into tradition.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; But yet the word was being born.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Is not what is going on? We have a lot
[2:22:57] of denomination,
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; but yet in the humble way,
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; God was to Kentucky
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; to Jeffersonville
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; to have a little baby being born there.
[2:23:09] a messenger
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; for this age
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; in the most simplest way
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; where Luke chapter 17 has to be
[2:23:19] fulfilled in our days where God himself
[2:23:21] comes down
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; allow a man sanctify a man and tell him
[2:23:26] don't drink don't smoke
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; don't defile your body
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; because I need to use that body for a
[2:23:32] purpose
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; he will make himself available
[2:23:38] that God will use him.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "Just to let you guys know,
[2:23:42] this is not me. I'm just your brother."
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'll prove it to you by
[2:23:46] turning my back." He turned his back. He
[2:23:49] says, "Your sister over there, that's
[2:23:51] what happened to you. This when you are
[2:23:52] a young person. This is where you coming
[2:23:54] from. This is your address.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; This is not a man doing it.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; This is the promised word being
[2:24:04] fulfilled in your day." Yes.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; that was walking that day to the well.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Am I talking something different? I'm
[2:24:16] not talking about the call for body.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; the same pill of fire
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; was there talking to this woman.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; You know you had six husband. The five
[2:24:28] husband the one that you have is not
[2:24:29] your husband.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; That same one.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:33] is back again into this generation.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what you've been reading
[2:24:40] in the Bible
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; is being fulfilled in your day.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Benam said the same angel
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; that came over there is here in the
[2:24:52] building.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Then it says greater than Solomon is
[2:24:57] here.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; It did not say that Mechisedc. It says
[2:25:01] this
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Misedc.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; Who is this
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Melisedc?
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc was this.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; It says there is a one amen that can
[2:25:15] turn on the light.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; Saint we are blessed.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you love the Lord, can
[2:25:26] you give him a hand?
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Glory be to God.
[2:25:34] He's worthy. He's worthy to be praised.
[2:25:38] He's worthy to be praised. And I'm going
[2:25:40] to conclude with this.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Let's Let me look into something here.
[2:25:45] Please.
[2:25:46] Are you bearing with me just for a
[2:25:48] little bit more? Is that okay?
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Please forgive me.
[2:25:52] [Music]
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Please.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Can we go ahead? Can we go ahead?
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Preach it. All right. Thank you. Thank
[2:26:00] you. I appreciate I will not I will not
[2:26:01] take long. Sorry.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; There's something here I need to get to
[2:26:04] get to the airport right now.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; Let's look at something here. Luke
[2:26:12] 17:20.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; This one.
[2:26:19] Luke 17:20.
[2:26:24] Luke 17:20. Is that right?
[2:26:28] 17 20.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. And then when it was demanded unto
[2:26:33] the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
[2:26:36] should come. Is that right? He answered
[2:26:38] them and said the kingdom of God. Watch
[2:26:41] this very carefully.
[2:26:44] Said we're getting somewhere.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; When he demanded of the Pharisees when
[2:26:51] that question is when is about the time.
[2:26:53] Is that right?
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; When the kingdom of God should come, he
[2:26:56] answered them. He said, "The kingdom of
[2:26:59] God
[2:27:01] cometh not with observation."
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Let's continue again.
[2:27:09] Neither
[2:27:11] shall they say, Lord, here there,
[2:27:15] behold, the kingdom of God is within
[2:27:20] you.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; They're looking for a time. God is
[2:27:25] pointing them to a location.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Are we reading together?
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; They're needing a time.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; But God is pointing them somewhere.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; He says the kingdom of
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; God is within.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. John chapter 14.
[2:27:57] John 14:16.
[2:27:59] I'm going to read the Bible before I go
[2:28:00] a little faster here.
[2:28:03] And I will pray the father.
[2:28:06] He shall give you another comforter
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; that he may abide
[2:28:14] with you
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; forever.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; That word is used with, right?
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue. Go down. Even
[2:28:23] the spirit of truth whom the world the
[2:28:27] cosmos
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; the group of people are there
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; cannot receive.
[2:28:33] Not everybody can receive that.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; That is so true
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; because it seeth him not.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Neither knoweth him. What? Now catch
[2:28:47] this.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; We were talking about the kingdom.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Now it's getting into him.
[2:28:53] Tell me brother
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[2:28:59] him
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; but ye know him.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Oh how do I know him?
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; so it must be there
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; for me to know him
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; because he's talking to the disciple say
[2:29:12] ye know him. Oh
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; what are you talking about? You're
[2:29:15] talking about somebody the spirit of
[2:29:17] truth whom the world cannot receive
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; because it seeth not neither knoweth him
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; but ye know him.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; For he dwelleth what?
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; With you
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; and shall be
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; in you.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Watch this now. He He is with you
[2:29:41] because he's still in that body
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; called of the men of Galilee.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; But but down there's a promise of the
[2:29:48] comfort has come. It's no longer we feel
[2:29:51] it's going to be what in you.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Are we in the scripture?
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; Are you in the scripture?
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. 18. I will not
[2:30:02] leave you what comfortless saints. Yes.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; I will come
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; to you. I
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; I will come to you.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Yet a little while.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; The world
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; seeth me no more.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; But ye see me,
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; because I live,
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; yet shall live also. Yes, I live also.
[2:30:34] Yes.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; At that day, yes, I know that I am
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; in my father,
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; ye
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; in me,
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; and I in you.
[2:30:51] [Applause]
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Is that a word?
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; John chapter 7:37.
[2:31:02] In the last day, the great day of the
[2:31:05] feast, Jesus stood Christ says, "If any
[2:31:08] man what thirst, let him come unto me
[2:31:11] and drink." Is that right?
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; He that believe on me, as the scripture
[2:31:16] says, out of his belly
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; shall flow water
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; of water. 37 But this speak he
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; of the spirit
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; which that the believe on him
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; should receive
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; for the Holy Ghost
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; was not yet given because Jesus was not
[2:31:45] what
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; glorified.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; So Jesus had to be glorified for that
[2:31:51] spirit to come back to the body. Amen.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; So if he's still in flesh, that spirit
[2:31:57] cannot give be given.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; That spirit cannot come. So the only way
[2:32:02] he has to die and be crucified
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; ascend into heaven be glorified.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Then that spirit to return back on
[2:32:13] earth,
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; is he a different Jesus?
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Is he a different Jesus?
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you don't believe it, this is
[2:32:20] another scripture. When Paul was on the
[2:32:22] way to Emmas,
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; he's as he asked him, "Who are you,
[2:32:27] Lord?"
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "I am what?" Jesus.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; Was Jesus dead already? Yeah.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; But which Jesus was he talking?
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus, but now in many membered
[2:32:42] bodies.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; So once Paul was persecuting the
[2:32:46] Christian, they were persecuting Jesus.
[2:32:49] Amen.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; What make them Jesus? It was the spirit
[2:32:53] of Jesus in them.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, then the day of Pentecost as the day
[2:32:59] was fully come.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; He has to come to that day, that
[2:33:03] appointed day.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; John 16. Before I go ahead of myself,
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; nevertheless, 16:7
[2:33:24] 167
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; It is
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; expedient for you.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; Let me stop there.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody's pondering about this.
[2:33:41] It is expedient for you that I go
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; away.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; For if I I go not away,
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; the comforter will not come unto you,
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; but if I depart,
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; I will send him unto you.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yes.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; to be crucified, be glorified.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Then
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; back to the church again.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; Not the three person of the Trinity.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Excuse me to say that's nonsense.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; The same person, Jesus Christ,
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; the God of heaven and earth.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; With Abraham, that was meedc. That was a
[2:34:34] Theophony body.
[2:34:36] But that theophony
[2:34:39] became Jesus.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Who is this mech?
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; The resurrected Christ, the resurrected
[2:34:52] word for this day.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; 172. A new earth, a new heaven. So a new
[2:35:06] heaven and a new earth. For this first
[2:35:08] heaven and the first earth will pass
[2:35:10] away. But in the new heaven and new
[2:35:12] earth, Paul said over here in the book
[2:35:14] of Hebrews, for we receive a kingdom
[2:35:18] that cannot be moved. How did we get
[2:35:21] into that kingdom? Not by a religious
[2:35:24] system,
[2:35:25] but a kingdom of the kingdom of God is
[2:35:28] what? Within you. You read it.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; The kingdom. Watch this. He says the
[2:35:33] king and
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; his word is the same.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; It's within you.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this?
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Just to make sure it's up there.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Vindicating
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; the hour,
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; the hour
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; that we are now living
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; the promise that God made for this day.
[2:36:01] This eight here we are living with the
[2:36:06] king sitting in heavenly places watching
[2:36:10] him doing these things.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Say amen to the way.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:21] [Applause]
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was saying. reject not
[2:36:29] him that speaketh now
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; because down there because when he was
[2:36:34] talking about the the shaking and all of
[2:36:36] it that was in the time of Moses
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; because when God spoke the mountain was
[2:36:41] shaking. Is that right?
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; It was thundering and all of these
[2:36:44] things smoke and all of it but when Paul
[2:36:47] was speaking there was no manifestation
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; no thunder but the same voice.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? Hebrew 12, we
[2:36:58] just read it.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; No manifestation, no shaking,
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; but the promise word of God
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; was happening.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; So sometime we expect things to happen.
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; Oh wow. If things does not move, Lord, I
[2:37:13] can't move.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; Give me a sign.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; But God is moving. In the time of
[2:37:19] Elijah,
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; he was standing all said God was not
[2:37:23] there. But God, it was in a still small
[2:37:26] voice.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Said you must be able to be sensitive to
[2:37:30] that still small voice.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; It's not loud.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; It's not shaking the mountain, but it's
[2:37:35] a revelation.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; You can be sitting in the room, nobody's
[2:37:38] around. You hear a voice speaking.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; You take heed to that voice.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; And that voice is not wrong.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; And when you look in the word versus
[2:37:48] that voice that spoke to you, you
[2:37:50] recognize that it's the same person.
[2:37:53] Yes.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; Because the one that spoke to your heart
[2:37:57] said, "Let me say this. This is an
[2:37:58] experience.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; You can't take it or reject it. That's
[2:38:01] fine.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; When God deals with you,
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; it must be scriptural."
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; Not every voice that you hear is of God.
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; But if God speaks to your heart,
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; one day you randomly just reading the
[2:38:16] scripture you don't even know you're
[2:38:18] reading.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; And you're like, "Oh yes.
[2:38:22] I never knew
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; what he told me is in the scripture
[2:38:28] [Music]
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; saint when you can connect these things
[2:38:32] like this you know now that you are in a
[2:38:34] good place
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; cuz you're no longer dealing with your
[2:38:37] own ability
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; this is God ministering to your heart
[2:38:41] now
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; are you with me
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; this is not a church now it's no longer
[2:38:46] just going to church now it's a
[2:38:47] revelation
[2:38:50] He can speak to me yet he can minister
[2:38:52] to me in the word.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; The same way that spoke is the same one
[2:38:56] that is speaking the word.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; When brother Brenham will say something
[2:38:58] but the man was talking about before he
[2:39:00] leaves
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; you know he was mentioning about uh
[2:39:02] Isaiah and all of how Jesus closed the
[2:39:04] book and all what
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; all of this thing had to happen.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Even himself he did not know but did not
[2:39:12] know.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; But God showed him he says you know
[2:39:14] whatever just happened
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; it is in the scripture.
[2:39:19] Is that right?
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; It has to happen to you too.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; Something's happen in our life. You
[2:39:24] don't know.
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; But God is speaking to your heart.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; No manifestation what word of
[2:39:30] whatsoever. But God was still speaking
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; to his prophet. Now let's look at this.
[2:39:35] I'm in closing.
[2:39:37] The world is falling apart.
[2:39:40] 120 121. I'm I'm coming to a close. Do
[2:39:43] you love the Lord?
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; We have received a kingdom
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; that cannot be moved.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot be shaken in this hour.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; It's saying something. It says we are
[2:39:58] dead. Our life are hidden in in God
[2:40:00] through Christ. And not only that, but
[2:40:04] we are raised with him. Raised up what?
[2:40:07] In the in the system, in a
[2:40:09] denominational organization. No,
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; we are resurrected in the kingdom of
[2:40:14] God. Amen.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within. Why these
[2:40:19] you see all these manmade system must
[2:40:22] fall.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; All of these things people are dear
[2:40:25] denomination. Oh, call me Lutheran and
[2:40:26] this he must fall.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; But there's only one thing that will
[2:40:30] remain.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Not once more I will
[2:40:34] shake the world. Is quoting now what we
[2:40:36] just read. But I will shake also I will
[2:40:38] shake heaven. And those things that
[2:40:41] cannot be shook is what will remain.
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we receive a kingdom.
[2:40:46] Receiving a kingdom that cannot be sold
[2:40:49] or moved. That's the kingdom of God. Not
[2:40:52] a system, not a political will or no
[2:40:54] denomination, but a kingdom. Let's go to
[2:40:57] the next one. Let's continue.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; We are in a kingdom, sitting in heavenly
[2:41:06] places with the eternal king. M
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; enjoying eternal life by the eternal
[2:41:11] word.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; Going to an an eternal heaven forever to
[2:41:16] be with him. Hallelujah. Living in the
[2:41:18] presence of the king. I love him. I'm so
[2:41:20] glad to be one of them. I'm so glad to
[2:41:23] be dead in Christ. Alive in the kingdom
[2:41:25] of God. This is not my home. We seeking
[2:41:29] a kingdom. We're seeking a king. We seek
[2:41:31] the king. We are already watch what the
[2:41:34] prophet is saying.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are already in the kingdom.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; We are seeking the king to come
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; and the king quickly will come to his
[2:41:46] kingdom.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; Do you see that? We receive a kingdom
[2:41:50] that cannot be moved. All these things
[2:41:52] other you know all these other things
[2:41:54] are falling apart. America is falling
[2:41:57] apart.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Europe is falling apart. Asia is falling
[2:42:02] apart. All the world is falling apart.
[2:42:05] But we are in
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; a kingdom, an eternal kingdom. It cannot
[2:42:12] be moved.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; But that kingdom is the Holy Spirit
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; in you.
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit in you
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; is to be born again, to die to yourself,
[2:42:29] to receive the kingdom.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And what is the Holy
[2:42:34] Spirit? Brother Benham says something in
[2:42:36] closing. He says,
[2:42:38] I cannot in the message, what is the
[2:42:40] Holy Spirit? I'm not not going to read
[2:42:42] it. Says you cannot come and receive the
[2:42:44] Holy Ghost unless you know what it is.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; This these things are very important.
[2:42:52] Saint, we are blessed. When I saying
[2:42:54] we're blessed,
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; it's not a slip of we are blessed.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Watch this element. You cannot come and
[2:43:01] receive the Holy Ghost unless you know
[2:43:04] what it is.
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; You cannot receive it if you know
[2:43:11] what it is unless you believe
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; it is given to you.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; And it is for you.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; You cannot know whether you got it
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; or not
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; unless you know what result
[2:43:29] It brings.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Then you will know what you've got when
[2:43:35] you get it.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; You want me to repeat it again?
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; You cannot come
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; and receive the Holy Ghost
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; unless you know what it is.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; You must know what the Holy Ghost is.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; The second thing you have to believe
[2:43:54] that it is given
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; you know to you
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; and it is for you.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; Now you cannot know whether you got it
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; or not
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; unless you know what result it brings
[2:44:10] when you receive it.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; You must know it.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; You know it is to you and for you. Yes.
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; You know also the result it brings when
[2:44:21] you get it.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; Then you know what you got when you get
[2:44:26] it.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; Is it simple? Right.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Saints Peter was given the key of the
[2:44:35] kingdom.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that?
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; You can read it in Matthew chapter 16.
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; He was given unto him the key to the
[2:44:45] kingdom.
[2:44:47] And later on the day of Pentecost after
[2:44:50] Peter had received the Holy Ghost, he's
[2:44:53] the one that had the key. Is that right?
[2:44:56] And they asked him, "Brethren,
[2:44:58] what must we do to be saved?" Is that
[2:45:00] right?
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; He gave them three elements.
[2:45:04] He said, "Repent every one of you.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:45:09] Jesus Christ
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; and ye shall receive
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; the baptism, the gift of the Holy
[2:45:15] Ghost." That's act 2:38.
[2:45:20] Simple
[2:45:23] repentance.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; There's some people say, "Oh, I have
[2:45:26] received the Holy Ghost."
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; When did you repent? I don't have to
[2:45:32] know that, but you know, it's just the
[2:45:34] principle of the word, right?
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I believe I'm going to heaven.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. All of us, glory to God, we're
[2:45:40] going.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; But we should not deceive ourselves.
[2:45:48] We should not deceive ourselves.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm closing with this. I'm closing
[2:45:51] everything. I feel like this is this is
[2:45:54] the time.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; I feel in my heart the pool. So I feel
[2:45:57] like this is the time.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; So now
[2:46:01] if you walk in the tabernacle,
[2:46:04] uh, can you can you can you post that
[2:46:07] picture?
[2:46:09] And I watch I want you to catch to catch
[2:46:11] this.
[2:46:14] If a person that does not know God, is
[2:46:16] that right? Is a sinner doing wrong
[2:46:21] because this temple here, you know, is
[2:46:24] what Moses illustrated in the in the
[2:46:25] wilderness. Is that right? You see that?
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; You see that right?
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. A person who does not know God
[2:46:32] because this is the temple and you are
[2:46:34] the temple.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; Touch that. So I'll be going back and
[2:46:37] forth but you can't able you can't be
[2:46:39] able to to digest this. You enter here
[2:46:41] you meet the breast and altar.
[2:46:45] This is a place where they had to kill
[2:46:48] the sacrifice.
[2:46:51] This is a wash bas.
[2:46:55] They washing the the the the
[2:46:58] high priest and and you know and also
[2:47:01] washing the sacrifice. And you enter,
[2:47:03] you've got the manora, which is the
[2:47:04] candlesticks, the showbread,
[2:47:07] the altar of incense, and then down here
[2:47:10] is the altar. All right, the ark of the
[2:47:13] covenant right over there. Do you see
[2:47:15] that?
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; And this place here is where the shagana
[2:47:18] glory comes down.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; After the death of Jesus Christ, this
[2:47:22] curtain is no longer there.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody catching this, right?
[2:47:29] This one is is no longer there. In the
[2:47:33] Old Testament, if you do not you cannot
[2:47:36] enter into this area because only the
[2:47:40] high priest had to enter once a year. Is
[2:47:44] that right?
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Are you catching this right now?
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; Any any man that is not qualified to
[2:47:52] enter will die.
[2:47:56] But now
[2:47:58] not entering into this place is death.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; Then
[2:48:05] if you enter you die for the matter of
[2:48:08] fact there were cherans.
[2:48:10] You see when Adam sinned it was
[2:48:13] forbidden unto him
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; to eat the tree of life.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; There were cherans there. Is that right?
[2:48:20] Amen.
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; Nobody had access into God fully because
[2:48:26] even all the prophet when they died they
[2:48:27] went to paradise. Is that right?
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; They could not really access that place.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; But Jesus had to die and once he died
[2:48:36] you remember the veil of the temple went
[2:48:39] from the top to the bottom
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; which means you have access
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; into that place that was once forbidden.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:48] Nobody this morning can hinder you or
[2:48:51] this afternoon to enter to meet the
[2:48:54] glory.
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[2:48:59] You can go in by yourself if you have a
[2:49:02] choice to.
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; If you're a sinner, you don't know God.
[2:49:09] You have access here.
[2:49:11] &gt;&gt; And by the time this is Calvary, you
[2:49:14] must die to yourself. accept your
[2:49:16] sacrifice because Jesus Christ is your
[2:49:18] sacrifice.
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; If you decide to be baptized, you get
[2:49:22] baptized.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; But don't stop here.
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; Your destination is here.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; And most of the time when we enter, oh,
[2:49:34] I came to the altar, gave my life to the
[2:49:35] Lord Jesus Christ. That's it.
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; Then I'm good. Woo, man. I'm safe.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; But that's not your destination.
[2:49:43] The destination is over there.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; You must meet
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; the glory
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; here.
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; When you enter, you say, "Oh, I'm
[2:49:53] baptized."
[2:49:55] That's good.
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; But let's watch our life
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; because that snake
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; that is causing us to sin
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; is still there.
[2:50:09] Brother, if you have time, study the
[2:50:12] future home. I was about to get into it,
[2:50:13] but I I held myself for a reason. I
[2:50:16] don't know why, but anyways.
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; So, you would understand the B is saying
[2:50:21] you're entering here inside of your
[2:50:23] heart there is a snake.
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; See, the desire to see
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; he give an illustration of two hearts.
[2:50:30] Says this one has a dove. The other one
[2:50:34] has a snake. When you enter here, you
[2:50:37] accept the Lord Jesus Christ, you be
[2:50:38] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:50:40] Christ. That's a good conscience toward
[2:50:41] God. Is that right?
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; Baptism.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; But from here,
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; don't stop here.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; Because that snake is not dead yet.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; You can be baptized.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; But you still have the desire to sin.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; The same thing that you dealt with
[2:50:58] before when you were in the world,
[2:51:00] &gt;&gt; they're still coming back.
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; You wondering say, "What in the world? I
[2:51:04] thought when I get baptized all is gone.
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; Because once you repent for the sin that
[2:51:10] you have right here, those sins are
[2:51:13] gone.
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; It's empty. There's no record of it.
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; But you still have a walk. If you linger
[2:51:20] here too long,
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; that snake has not died yet.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; You need the fire of this place
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; to burn that snake. Amen.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; That snake will make you comfortable to
[2:51:33] come to church.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:51:37] &gt;&gt; You will sing in a choir.
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; You would explore all your gift. You'll
[2:51:42] be a very gifted person.
[2:51:45] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Benham says when
[2:51:48] Judas
[2:51:50] he operated miracles,
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; are you with me?
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; But when he came to the Holy Ghost, he
[2:51:57] showed his color. Yeah.
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; There is a time there is a principle
[2:52:04] of the harvest.
[2:52:07] Everything that is planted does not show
[2:52:10] its color as it is planted.
[2:52:13] &gt;&gt; Is the fruit that would will actually
[2:52:16] show everything.
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; That's why let me say a sense I could
[2:52:21] have entered into this because of time.
[2:52:23] Please forgive me.
[2:52:25] This is the place where we must meet God
[2:52:29] there.
[2:52:30] The reason why we come into church is
[2:52:32] not just say I'm already baptized. I'm
[2:52:34] already in this church is not enough.
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; But instead of us being a blessing, we
[2:52:39] become a stumbling block.
[2:52:42] That snake is stealing having effect on
[2:52:45] our life, how we behave, our answers,
[2:52:48] our reaction and all of it
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; because that snake is not has not died
[2:52:54] yet.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; But you need the fire of God
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; to burn that snake
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; so that the d the the dog
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; can have a place to dwell in. Amen.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; Saint you know when
[2:53:07] Jesus this guy came to Jesus and said
[2:53:11] good master no not good master the
[2:53:14] how you call him
[2:53:19] he told him something says
[2:53:22] if you're not born again you cannot see
[2:53:25] the kingdom of god
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; you would not in other words but the
[2:53:28] says you cannot understand you would not
[2:53:31] understand the kingdom of god
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; show me quote 11 or 12, please. And I'm
[2:53:36] going to close it. I'm not going to read
[2:53:39] it. I'm just going to pick up something.
[2:53:41] It says, "When you understand the
[2:53:43] belief, Jesus says, except a man is born
[2:53:45] again, you cannot see the kingdom." In
[2:53:46] other words, understand
[2:53:49] the kingdom. The kingdom because the
[2:53:52] kingdom is what?
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; You catch that. So you have to
[2:53:57] understand and the only way you will
[2:54:00] understand it is compare what makes you
[2:54:04] do with what the Bible said he would
[2:54:08] make you do.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; You see that then your problem is
[2:54:12] solved. See it is the Holy Spirit.
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; S in closing
[2:54:20] can come please.
[2:54:24] We have received a kingdom.
[2:54:28] We must be born into that kingdom
[2:54:32] to not be shaken.
[2:54:35] Are you with me?
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; You say amen to the word.
[2:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot of things happening
[2:54:41] in our life. We having struggles and
[2:54:44] different things.
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; Many of us have to come to that place to
[2:54:50] meet God.
[2:54:54] It's not just about coming to church.
[2:54:57] What God recognized that would not be
[2:54:58] shaken
[2:55:00] is the Holy Spirit, the person of Jesus
[2:55:03] Christ in our heart.
[2:55:07] Saints, that would make us as the church
[2:55:11] to enter into that place
[2:55:15] to meet God
[2:55:19] because the world is shaking.
[2:55:22] everything around us, you know, nations
[2:55:25] are breaking. There's a lot of things
[2:55:28] happening. Do you agree with me?
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; But the word says there's only one
[2:55:36] kingdom that will not move,
[2:55:38] &gt;&gt; will not be shaken.
[2:55:41] Is the Holy Spirit in our heart
[2:55:44] as we standing.
[2:55:46] We can stand please.
[2:55:53] Saint after hearing such a word
[2:55:57] it comes to our heart now
[2:56:03] Lord help me
[2:56:06] every time that I come and when those
[2:56:08] doors are open
[2:56:10] I'm not just coming to make a presence
[2:56:12] here
[2:56:14] I need to mean business
[2:56:17] if these things are not be spoken openly
[2:56:19] [Music]
[2:56:21] We're not actually doing a great job,
[2:56:25] but we have to be prepared. Saints,
[2:56:30] let me put it this way, saints. I feel
[2:56:32] the Holy Spirit pounding in my heart. If
[2:56:35] you have a problem with someone, don't
[2:56:37] leave this place without fixing it.
[2:56:42] Can I repeat that again?
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; Today must be maybe your last day.
[2:56:51] If you have a problem with someone
[2:56:55] because as a Christian we must leave the
[2:56:58] life of Christ. So if we really got the
[2:57:02] spirit of Christ
[2:57:05] we should not leave this place and
[2:57:07] having a problem with someone.
[2:57:10] We have to make it right.
[2:57:14] The only responsibility that I have is
[2:57:17] to preach.
[2:57:20] I have my own life to worry about. It's
[2:57:23] not just I'm preaching to you myself,
[2:57:25] too. I'm sitting here. I need God's
[2:57:26] grace, too.
[2:57:28] But the word is true. I am guilty, Lord.
[2:57:32] &gt;&gt; Thy word is true. Have your way.
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; How many of us can really recognize it?
[2:57:39] Say, Lord, I lift my hand. I need you.
[2:57:42] How many of us really need God from the
[2:57:44] bottom of their heart?
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; Look inside of your own life. These
[2:57:49] secrets that are still hiding over there
[2:57:50] that nobody knows about.
[2:57:53] God is speaking directly to you.
[2:57:57] This might be your last day. I don't
[2:57:59] know. I'm not scaring anybody. I'm just
[2:58:00] saying.
[2:58:04] But the church of God has to be ready.
[2:58:10] Shall we pray? Heavenly Father,
[2:58:15] we're coming before you this afternoon.
[2:58:20] You've been so good to us.
[2:58:23] You have helped us so far to leave the
[2:58:25] world and to come.
[2:58:28] Lord, you have helped us. We have made a
[2:58:31] decision to go and to come to the altar
[2:58:35] and confess our sin.
[2:58:38] We've been baptized in the name of the
[2:58:39] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:58:42] And Lord, now we need to enter into that
[2:58:45] holiness of holies and to meet
[2:58:49] the pillar of fire.
[2:58:52] Lord, we pray tonight, this afternoon
[2:58:54] rather,
[2:58:56] Lord, that anybody that would have a
[2:58:58] desire to receive that Holy Ghost,
[2:59:02] Lord, may you come and confirm and
[2:59:04] vindicate your word in the life of
[2:59:07] anybody that is really desiring for it.
[2:59:12] Lord,
[2:59:14] nations are shaking.
[2:59:18] Bombs are ready to be to be completely
[2:59:21] to annihilate this earth.
[2:59:24] But yet Lord there are people that are
[2:59:26] unprepared.
[2:59:28] We are distracted oh God.
[2:59:31] But here you have given us your word.
[2:59:34] You have sent us a prophet
[2:59:37] Lord. If there's any sick in our midst
[2:59:42] Lord your word says I send my word and
[2:59:44] my word and heal them.
[2:59:46] May you heal us father Lord of our body,
[2:59:49] our spirit and soul
[2:59:52] from our hurts. Oh God, Father
[2:59:55] Lord you are merciful. You are gracious.
[3:00:00] Lord please
[3:00:02] help us Lord.
[3:00:05] We need you at this moment. Oh God. May
[3:00:07] you please touch heart and bring a
[3:00:10] spirit of conviction.
[3:00:12] Bring a spirit of conviction. Lord
[3:00:14] please grant it Lord.
[3:00:17] Because you are calling someone tonight.
[3:00:21] You are working the awareness of
[3:00:22] somebody tonight
[3:00:25] to take heed to the word of God.
[3:00:29] Lord, you have called us many time.
[3:00:32] You are also calling us again.
[3:00:35] You are telling us to come and take heed
[3:00:37] to the word. Your servant and many
[3:00:40] servants of God has gone through this
[3:00:42] place has preached the gospel.
[3:00:46] But Lord,
[3:00:48] we must yield our hearts to you, Lord.
[3:00:52] Cuz at the end of the time, oh God,
[3:00:53] Father, everything are shaking. But are
[3:00:56] we going to stand?
[3:00:59] Where are we going to spend eternity,
[3:01:00] Lord?
[3:01:02] But we're looking to you, Father, this
[3:01:04] morning, afternoon.
[3:01:06] &gt;&gt; Touch our hearts, Lord. May you change
[3:01:09] us, oh Lord. May you transform us
[3:01:14] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:01:19] Is there anybody here tonight that said,
[3:01:21] you know, I just want to renew my
[3:01:23] relationship with God. I want a new walk
[3:01:25] with God. Is there somebody tonight,
[3:01:27] this afternoon,
[3:01:29] can raise up their hand and say, Lord, I
[3:01:31] just need a new walk, like a a different
[3:01:33] experience with you.
[3:01:37] You can pray in your own just in your
[3:01:39] own heart. If there is something in your
[3:01:42] heart
[3:01:44] that you struggling with, tell God about
[3:01:46] it. Say, "God, you you know this. You
[3:01:48] know this thing. I'm still struggling
[3:01:50] with this
[3:01:53] and that thing is about to destroy you.
[3:01:55] You tired of it.
[3:01:57] You say enough. I've been fighting this
[3:01:59] for so long. I'm just tired."
[3:02:02] Would you take heed to God's voice and
[3:02:04] say, "Lord, I give you my heart. I give
[3:02:06] you my desire. Everything that I've got,
[3:02:08] I give it to you at this moment.
[3:02:21] [Music]
[3:02:26] Oh God,
[3:02:28] may you come, Father, Lord, intervene in
[3:02:30] our heart tonight, Lord.
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, we need you, Lord, in this moment.
[3:02:35] Oh God, may you send your Holy Spirit.
[3:02:39] May you send your Holy Spirit, Father.
[3:02:41] Lord, in this room, in this moment,
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, you brought a burden in my heart,
[3:02:47] Lord. Father, hear my Lord.
[3:02:50] Even myself, Lord God, I just lay at the
[3:02:52] altar.
[3:02:54] Confessing my sins. Oh God. Father,
[3:02:56] please forgive me.
[3:02:59] Be merciful to me, Lord.
[3:03:02] I need a closer walk, Father. Lord, I
[3:03:04] need you, Lord.
[3:03:07] Lord, please come.
[3:03:09] Destroy this thing. Lord,
[3:03:12] destroy me, Father. Lord God, things are
[3:03:14] in my life, Lord.
[3:03:17] I need you Lord Jesus.
[3:03:20] [Music]
[3:03:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you're able to do great things
[3:03:23] in our midst.
[3:03:26] Lord, may you bring us to that place, oh
[3:03:28] Lord God, through a new experience with
[3:03:30] you, Father.
[3:03:32] Your Holy Spirit has spoken, Lord. Amen.
[3:03:34] Lord, you have come this morning and you
[3:03:37] are still speaking in the heart of your
[3:03:39] children,
[3:03:41] &gt;&gt; Lord. Father, let your glorif.
[3:03:45] Oh, may you speak, oh God.
[3:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
