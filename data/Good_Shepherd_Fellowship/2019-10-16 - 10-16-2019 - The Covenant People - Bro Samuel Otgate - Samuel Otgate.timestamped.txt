[8:59] I'm gonna share this so I just had I
[9:02] wasn't going to last week not not at all
[9:06] I don't really care where anyone stands
[9:07] on politics but I felt like going to see
[9:10] what was up so I went to the Trump rally
[9:11] it was very exciting and I prayed before
[9:14] I went I was like god I'm gonna stand in
[9:17] line for hours let me stand in line next
[9:20] to someone that would be a blessing like
[9:22] let me let's let it be a connection for
[9:25] some reason ended up standing next to
[9:27] this couple or you know standing waiting
[9:31] sitting you know laying down like he's
[9:32] just waiting for hours and we ended up
[9:35] talking about God for a long long long
[9:39] time we ended up having once we got into
[9:42] the arena and stuff I mean that there
[9:44] Secret Service everywhere there's we we
[9:46] stood for hours waiting in the arena and
[9:49] we started talking about God I mean and
[9:52] come to find out like they it's really
[9:56] hard to explain but they've had miracles
[9:59] they've had lots of miracles they have
[10:01] prayed for tons of people they got
[10:03] kicked out of their church because so
[10:05] many people were getting healed that's
[10:06] the way that they put it they they said
[10:09] literally with their own eyes they saw
[10:12] someone's leg grow to be the right
[10:14] length as the other leg with their own
[10:16] eyes and they were just so like excited
[10:19] so we had up sharing testimonies my my
[10:22] aren't my I had goose bumps for like an
[10:24] hour I'm not even kidding and I was like
[10:27] this is weird like I was not expecting
[10:30] to have Church tonight and it was great
[10:33] and and you know we just talked about
[10:34] God for a really really long time
[10:36] probably four hours straight and what
[10:39] ended up happening though is you know we
[10:40] just prayed right there and we did we
[10:43] prayed for a while this right at there
[10:45] was a million people around us to think
[10:47] 20,000 people and we just prayed right
[10:49] there and you know and not not at all
[10:51] bringing politics into it at all but it
[10:53] was what was in
[10:54] interesting was we're here were praying
[10:55] and we pray for sister quiche together
[10:56] and we prayed for a couple other / burns
[10:58] and we're just praying away and then
[11:00] someone over the speaker says let's just
[11:02] start this rally tonight with a word of
[11:04] Prayer while we were praying and so I
[11:07] don't know what it means I'm not not at
[11:09] all
[11:09] saying hey it was the Lord that it was
[11:11] supposed to Trump's gonna win like no
[11:13] not at all
[11:13] but it was in or I felt in that moment I
[11:17] was the right thing to do I was supposed
[11:19] to be here I was supposed to meet these
[11:21] people I don't know why God knows God
[11:23] knows and I don't know if they'll come
[11:25] or not but they said that they were
[11:26] coming so eventually we'll see that
[11:28] they're gonna come visit our church so
[11:30] we'll see because they like to praise
[11:32] and they like to pray and so it's
[11:34] interesting they had a lot of
[11:36] testimonies and it was weird I actually
[11:37] thought about I was like man they sound
[11:39] like mom and dad kind of like a mix
[11:40] between mom and dad and some other
[11:42] people I know it's like the one the
[11:44] stories they were telling I was like you
[11:46] sound like people who are about to come
[11:48] into the message I didn't tell them that
[11:50] but I was like this is funny like this
[11:52] is weird
[11:53] and I don't know I don't know what will
[11:56] happen but you guys keep them in prayer
[11:58] Travis and his wife Jess and I just uh I
[12:03] don't know Lord knows all about it I
[12:06] just you know was funny for me because I
[12:07] hear I was I realized I and and I did
[12:11] just kind of mention you know just to
[12:12] kind of bring it up into conversation
[12:14] who really like hey have you heard of
[12:15] William Branham and because they talked
[12:17] about the event they've been studying
[12:18] Azusa Street and stuff like this and I
[12:20] was like you know like heaven he's like
[12:22] no one ever heard about him like okay
[12:23] you know do your research do your
[12:25] studying you know I just mentioned like
[12:26] Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and tried
[12:28] to bring some more just some more things
[12:30] for them to start considering because
[12:32] you can see that they're looking for
[12:33] something you know they talked about
[12:35] conspiracy theories and all this so
[12:37] they're just looking for everything
[12:38] they're looking for something everywhere
[12:40] they're just digging in ever you could
[12:42] just see they're just digging in
[12:43] everywhere trying to find truth and I
[12:47] just it was amazing something and I just
[12:50] I don't know it was amazing cuz I was
[12:54] there and I was standing there and I was
[12:55] like man I got a I got a testified it
[12:57] like I got I need to win them here or
[13:00] something because I've been praying
[13:01] lately it's like God if I don't you know
[13:04] I want to be involved with it
[13:07] one soul that I know it's like God I had
[13:10] an impact on this person that I know
[13:12] that I did like I want I want to know
[13:15] that I want I don't know not for my own
[13:17] glory but I don't want to feel like I've
[13:19] just been a bump on a log but my whole
[13:21] life like I want to be a part of that
[13:23] and then here it is I have I just been
[13:25] praying that recently I had this
[13:26] opportunity and it's like I'm talking to
[13:28] them I might the goose bumps or I'm like
[13:30] gods here I know like this is not a
[13:33] coincidence this is there's a reason for
[13:35] this and I just you know something came
[13:38] over because I'm like man I feel like I
[13:40] should be more like like studied in like
[13:42] let's go through the five comings of
[13:44] Elijah or you know something like that
[13:46] but I realized like in that moment it
[13:49] was like you know you've been in these
[13:52] situations before and the key is rest
[13:57] rest yield take no thought what you
[14:01] should say and rest and just let it come
[14:04] out just just let just let say whatever
[14:07] comes to mind let it come out because
[14:10] it's God we're not relying on our own
[14:12] intellectual faith we're not here to
[14:14] convince anybody not here to say let's
[14:17] open our Bibles and debate you know
[14:19] we're not we're not and they they're the
[14:21] ones that said hey we're coming to your
[14:24] church I didn't even invite them I don't
[14:26] like I don't know if they'll actually
[14:28] come but it's like god that's something
[14:31] else that is something else so I just
[14:34] wanted to throw that out there because
[14:35] that happened this last week and it just
[14:37] encouraged my heart and the footsteps of
[14:40] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[14:41] you know we have to trust these things
[14:44] as being true and real because God said
[14:47] so not because we feel anything or
[14:50] because we're excited that day or like
[14:52] you know or whatever it's all about
[14:54] being sensitive to the will of God in
[14:56] the moment in the time and letting God
[14:58] speak so anyways I'm not supposed to be
[15:01] preaching tonight so I'm not going to do
[15:03] that I just it encouraged my heart and
[15:05] keep them in prayer I would appreciate
[15:06] it and we'll see what God will do praise

[25:20] [Music]
[27:26] okay actually been thinking about town
[27:36] and just believe in the Lord I started
[27:41] thinking about
[27:47] you know like Paul says in the book of
[27:49] Corinthians Eicher itself should teach
[27:51] us and nature is creation praise lord
[27:59] nature is creation
[28:04] and when you read the Bible in the Bible
[28:09] the first verse in the beginning God
[28:13] created the heaven in the air praise the
[28:18] Lord it's amazing when when when you
[28:21] know when the Lord put some things on
[28:25] your heart in you and you started
[28:27] thinking about it in a way that he
[28:29] brings it out is it becomes beautiful
[28:33] I was thinking about it God giving us
[28:41] the Creator there was the first way that
[28:45] God revealed himself in the beginning
[28:48] God created the heaven in the air in the
[28:53] last way that God reveal himself is also
[28:56] as a creator amen
[29:00] 2:7 church age the Bible says he you
[29:04] revere himself as Jesus speaking the
[29:08] faithful and true witness the beginning
[29:11] of the creation of God praise Lord and
[29:17] creation is is an ongoing work
[29:22] there is a reason why from the first day
[29:24] God created the second day he created a
[29:27] charity he created when it got to the
[29:29] 6th day he made a man in His image to
[29:33] continue because creation is a
[29:36] continuous work praise the Lord
[29:40] what is redemption creation to bring
[29:44] back what was lost what is salvation
[29:47] creation what is healing
[29:51] creation
[29:55] praise Lord
[30:07] let's just take these few per burden
[30:10] tonight and then we will go into the
[30:11] word brother Samuel Ortega when butter
[30:16] Lord was praying he says he says Lord
[30:21] get better one out of the way that says
[30:23] he surely did it tonight brother Samuel

[31:18] cancer and we pray that a law with kind
[31:21] of a brain divine healing praise the

[31:54] taking is the reason why she came with
[31:57] their pain in her legs and they had
[32:00] ruptured the kneecap you know is the
[32:07] side effect of the medication so she's
[32:11] dealing with pains Europeans in her legs
[32:14] and being trying to take her to therapy
[32:17] for how to walk so she said to me she
[32:20] said were wanna just praying I said all
[32:23] God you you know I'm trusting you and
[32:26] believe in you and and you know and and
[32:30] this has happened to me
[32:31] and in a way that she said it I said to
[32:34] Horace's I said as a sister Kish God has
[32:39] been our hero don't never make God the
[32:43] bombing of your movie he's always the
[32:47] hero praise the Lord
[32:49] you know it's just a human expression
[32:56] the way we humans react when something
[32:59] happen with it so God why you allow this
[33:02] once in one sense nothing evil will
[33:05] happen except the Lord allowed it that's
[33:08] a truth but also the way you approach
[33:12] that in your mind sometimes it's like
[33:16] really God you really allowed this to
[33:20] happen
[33:21] so it looks like now he's the one that
[33:24] is doing it
[33:26] praise the Lord don't make him the bad
[33:29] man of the movie because he's the hero
[33:32] amen God is the hero and he will remain
[33:36] the hero at all I said God is the hero
[33:39] praise the Lord
[33:41] so and that's that's what is happening
[33:44] to her I think she told me they were
[33:47] going to see her tonight and see if they
[33:49] will let her go home tonight or possibly
[33:51] tomorrow so she's dealing with that legs
[33:55] and and and you know and and that that
[33:58] just how it is that's that's the beauty
[34:02] of creation for it to ever get beautiful
[34:07] it got to get ugly
[34:10] amen in the beginning God created the
[34:14] heaven and the earth and the F was with
[34:18] our form
[34:19] and darkness was upon the deep a hard to
[34:23] get ugly
[34:24] before it becomes beautiful
[34:29] praise the Lord and and just just seeing
[34:35] they're out of the scripture and and you
[34:38] know and some of the things that brother
[34:40] Branham shared I mean it's just it's
[34:42] just kind of a blow my mind praise the

[48:00] bless you
[48:01] yeah just for a word of encouragement
[48:06] may not just take long but I won't
[48:13] invite your attention the book of
[48:14] Genesis was just wondering why God put
[48:23] in my heart to speak this Genesis
[48:27] chapter 12
[48:39] and we round-trip from bus now we are
[48:46] ready from Genesis chapter 15 sorry
[48:50] Genesis chapter 15 and we are reading
[48:53] from verse 1 to 6 Genesis chapter 15
[49:02] from verse 1 to success after these
[49:07] things the word of the Lord came unto
[49:09] Abram in a vision saying fear not
[49:14] Abram my shield and I exceeding great
[49:19] reward
[49:21] and Abram said Lord God what will now
[49:27] give me seeing I go childless and the
[49:30] steward of my house in this Eliezer of
[49:33] Damascus and Abram said Behold to me
[49:37] thou hast given no seed and lo one born
[49:42] in my house is my hair and behold the
[49:46] word of the Lord came at him saying this
[49:49] shall not be thine hair but he that
[49:52] shall come forth out of thine own balls
[49:55] shall be thine hair and he brought him
[49:59] forth abroad and say look now toward
[50:02] heaven and tell the stars if thou be
[50:05] able to number them and he said unto Him
[50:08] so shall thy seed be and he believed in
[50:13] the Lord and he counted it to him for
[50:17] righteousness
[50:18] and they also can go to a book of
[50:23] Galatians chapter 3 and won't we
[50:33] one six even as abraham believed God and
[50:43] it was accounted to him for
[50:46] righteousness
[50:48] no idea for that they which are of faith
[50:51] the same are the children of Abraham and
[50:56] the scripture foreseeing that God would
[51:00] justify the heathen through faith
[51:02] preached before the gospel unto Abraham
[51:06] saying in thee shall all nations be
[51:10] blessed so then they which be of faith
[51:15] are blessed with faithful Abraham may
[51:22] the Lord bless turning of his 1 and we
[51:26] can be seated I just call this confident
[51:34] people amen
[51:38] I believe that we are a confident people
[51:43] you believe that amen amen and amen
[51:51] praise God so we thank God that we are
[51:56] the seed of Abraham by faith amen
[52:03] the Bible says we are the seed of
[52:07] Abraham by faith and when God was
[52:11] talking to Abraham that in blessing I'll
[52:15] bless you you are not talking about the
[52:18] natural seed he was talking about the
[52:22] spiritual seed which is you and me
[52:27] praise God so Abraham lived and acted
[52:34] the way he did is because he was under a
[52:39] covenant praise God
[52:43] and everyone that God is called amen he
[52:49] lives under a covenant he walks under a
[52:53] covenant amen praise His Holy Name Amen
[53:00] and what God did to Abraham he will
[53:04] always do to his seed after him praise
[53:09] God
[53:10] so they were God talked to Abraham
[53:14] they were God called Abraham the where
[53:17] God spoke to Abraham
[53:19] whatever God did to Abraham he must do
[53:23] to his seed after him praise been in him
[53:27] O Lord
[53:28] everything that God did to Abraham he
[53:31] Lee do to you amen
[53:35] the way he called Abraham the way he
[53:39] talked to Abraham the way he tried
[53:42] Abraham the way blessed Abraham he will
[53:46] do the same to you
[53:47] I believe that amen praise God that the
[53:57] promises here let me guess which one
[53:59] quote I hope we are not on much hurry
[54:07] amen
[54:13] praise God
[54:15] he says in the message Abraham and his
[54:18] seed after him that was preached in 61
[54:24] in April he says now paragraph 8 5 so
[54:31] now it's by grace that God called you
[54:36] not what you did what you could do or
[54:42] what you will do if you are the seed of
[54:46] Abraham God spoke to you by His amazing
[54:50] grace just like he did Abraham in the
[54:55] eternal chapter of Genesis amen
[54:58] because Abraham was just like any one of
[55:03] us but the Bible says God just for
[55:08] problem among his relatives his in the
[55:13] Brethren in the parents and everything
[55:15] like that among the people maybe we're
[55:19] worthless of idols amen but from nowhere
[55:24] God called Abraham and I believe that's
[55:30] what God did to us that's what good it
[55:33] to me hallelujah and he says now amen
[55:41] now and then notice as soon as Abram
[55:45] believed God by justification believing
[55:49] on the Lord we are justified immediately
[55:53] God called Abram then total separation
[55:57] from all unbelief in other way he didn't
[56:02] you his ask equation when God called you
[56:08] did you separate from unbelief because
[56:12] that's what God do to Abraham even after
[56:17] calling us he wants us total separation
[56:21] come out of the wall come out of
[56:23] unbelief come out of there things of
[56:25] this world
[56:26] amen separate you from your your kin
[56:31] dreadz from your kia from your
[56:34] associates come out of the pool rooms
[56:37] come out of the dazzles come away from
[56:40] the things of the wall God calls for a
[56:44] total separation to Abram seed because
[56:48] that's what he called Abraham praise God
[56:52] and that's what he does to us after God
[56:57] calling you he wants you to completely
[57:00] separate you remember Abraham even tried
[57:05] to walk with ezel I think his nephew
[57:08] amen but he had to separate he tried to
[57:13] walk with his father I think he died
[57:15] somewhere because God had called Abraham
[57:19] alone praise God and I believe today
[57:25] when God calls a man or he calls a woman
[57:31] amen God wants total separation
[57:35] and God will always want to speak to you
[57:40] only to you praise God he wants to deal
[57:45] with you alone not with anybody but to
[57:49] you alone as an individual
[57:51] amen you know Lord also tried to go with
[57:55] Abraham but Lord was not cold in the
[58:00] right even Sarah or got a call and also
[58:06] you find all over the journey sorrow
[58:09] ruled out the promises of God but God
[58:12] was dealing with Abraham
[58:16] Amen praise God amen now when you look
[58:24] at the life of Abraham when God called
[58:27] Abraham God spoke to him seven times
[58:34] amen praise God putting seven virtues in
[58:42] Abraham maybe can we just go back to the
[58:46] Bible so if God called you when he has
[58:51] to speak to you on so seven times Amen
[59:00] praise God let us go to book of Genesis
[59:03] chapter 12 Genesis chapter 12 and you
[59:11] want to start from verse 1 verse 12 I'm
[59:22] in chapter 12 verse 1 he says now the
[59:26] Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of
[59:31] thy country and from thy kindred and
[59:33] from thy father's house unto a land that
[59:36] I will show thee and I will make of thee
[59:39] a great nation I'll bring thee I'll
[59:41] bless thee and make thy name great and
[59:44] thou shalt be a blessing and I'll bless
[59:47] them that bless thee and curse him that
[59:51] curseth thee and in thee shall all
[59:53] families of the earth be blessed so
[59:57] Abram departed as the Lord had spoken
[1:00:01] unto him and Lord went with him and
[1:00:04] Abram was 75 years old when he depend
[1:00:08] out of out of Haran praise God
[1:00:14] God speaks Abraham come out of your
[1:00:18] people come out of your kindred praises
[1:00:21] on him and that was faith in all right
[1:00:27] he just believed it and walked out faith
[1:00:33] in a right
[1:00:36] someone is talking to him but God
[1:00:38] speaking to him and he comes out because
[1:00:43] God has spoken to him and you have to
[1:00:46] come out because God has spoken to you
[1:00:50] amen all right so that was the faith
[1:00:56] coming out of the world in a right all
[1:01:00] right let us jump to verse 7 and the
[1:01:04] Lord appeared unto Abram answered a
[1:01:07] truth and to thy seed will I give this
[1:01:10] land and the variability and altar of
[1:01:15] the Lord who appeared unto him all
[1:01:19] together Abraham God appears to him
[1:01:24] Abraham God speaks to him I was telling
[1:01:29] the church at home that brother you mean
[1:01:33] since you believed the message God has
[1:01:36] never spoken to you and then you tell me
[1:01:40] where is it oh Fabra amen God must speak
[1:01:45] to you
[1:01:46] hallelujah because in spoke to Abram
[1:01:50] here he appeared to Abram and is giving
[1:01:54] him a promise
[1:01:56] amen I only give you this land and you
[1:02:01] are seen after you praise God because
[1:02:06] when God calls you he must give you a
[1:02:09] promise praise God
[1:02:12] what does God promise you why are you
[1:02:16] believing this message there must be a
[1:02:18] promise you can't can say I believe what
[1:02:23] are you believing praise God because if
[1:02:27] you have a promise then you will hold
[1:02:29] all to that I promise
[1:02:32] praise be them alone so God gives a
[1:02:36] promise Abraham says I'm going to give
[1:02:40] you this land I'm going to give you busy
[1:02:44] heritage hallelujah and that's what I
[1:02:47] know that God called me
[1:02:49] and has given me I mean he repairs and
[1:02:52] I'm writing I'm struggling I'm not going
[1:02:56] to look back until I get a heritage
[1:03:00] plays belong on and you know if God are
[1:03:04] not given your promise then you're not
[1:03:06] going to fight for it amen you're not
[1:03:10] going to be bad at about it but because
[1:03:13] you have a promise you will struggle for
[1:03:16] it you will fight until you get there
[1:03:20] promise hallelujah
[1:03:23] oh praise His Holy Name that we have a
[1:03:27] promise of eternal life we have a
[1:03:31] promise of going to heaven
[1:03:33] hallelujah so that's one if anything try
[1:03:36] to obstruct us trying to stop us we are
[1:03:39] fighting because we have been living the
[1:03:41] promise hallelujah
[1:03:44] there's already Peter and the rest of
[1:03:46] the apostles were given a promise
[1:03:49] amen go and wait until you receive their
[1:03:55] promise amen
[1:03:57] they waited anyway because there was a
[1:04:00] promise for them and till they received
[1:04:03] a promise
[1:04:04] they could leave the Upper Room Amen so
[1:04:08] if you have been given a promise brother
[1:04:11] you're gonna stand you're gonna fight
[1:04:14] you are going to struggle
[1:04:16] you are gonna live until you receive the
[1:04:20] promise amen
[1:04:23] so that was virtue I were together
[1:04:26] brothers okay let us go to Genesis
[1:04:30] chapter 13 and verse 14 God appearing to
[1:04:36] Abraham God is speaking to Abraham and
[1:04:40] that's what he is dreaming to EZ seed

[1:20:10] right and God has spoken to us in seven
[1:20:13] voices so that the nature of God can
[1:20:17] come back to us men now God despot
[1:20:24] stopped speaking to Abram because the
[1:20:27] virtues are already in him
[1:20:29] we go now to chapter 22 amen chapter 22
[1:20:38] from verse 1 and it came to pass after
[1:20:45] these things that God did attempt
[1:20:47] Abraham he's not saying to Abram is not
[1:20:52] talking to Abram but he is tempting
[1:20:58] Abram is trying Abraham and said unto
[1:21:02] him Abram and he said Behold Here I am
[1:21:05] and he said take now thy son thy only
[1:21:10] son Isaac whom thou lovest praise God

[1:21:26] wish you a pyramid here sorry but you
[1:21:29] understand what I'm saying amen
[1:21:32] after the seven virtues then God wanted
[1:21:36] Abram to take Isaac on top of the
[1:21:39] pyramid and roblem says Isaac was a type
[1:21:43] of love which is charity to seal the
[1:21:49] seven virtues in Abram amen

[1:22:26] mountain amen let us read it again
[1:22:33] praise God and it came to pass after
[1:22:38] these things that God did tempt a
[1:22:40] Brahmin said a dream Abram and he said
[1:22:43] behold I am and he said Technovation not
[1:22:47] only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get
[1:22:50] in the land of Moriah and offer him
[1:22:53] there for a burnt offering upon one of
[1:22:56] the mountains which I'll tell me oh
[1:23:01] praise God
[1:23:02] our mountain pyramid amen can you put it
[1:23:10] back again brother amen so then where
[1:23:15] God dealt with Abraham is there where
[1:23:18] God is going to deal with his seed after
[1:23:21] him amen
[1:23:24] you have to have their faith their
[1:23:26] virtue their knowledge their temporal
[1:23:28] their pressures their goal eNOS brother
[1:23:31] economies are very charity they love
[1:23:34] within the Holy Ghost himself to seal
[1:23:37] your life amen praise God so when your
[1:23:48] life is feel that way then you are as
[1:23:52] perfect as God is perfect seal with the
[1:23:57] Holy Ghost that's the life that God is
[1:24:00] calling us to and other provinces work
[1:24:04] according to Abraham we do to each one
[1:24:07] of us and I want to tell a charge now
[1:24:11] these virtues you don't just want say Oh
[1:24:14] God give me faith or God give me virtue
[1:24:16] or girl give me coordinates you are
[1:24:19] going to be tried to receive

[1:24:26] every virtue you have to be tried in
[1:24:29] order to receive them praise God who
[1:24:34] together brothers amen
[1:24:38] I love that rebus amen so God is working
[1:24:46] on you God is working on me the way he
[1:24:50] was working with Abram the Ray was
[1:24:52] talking with Abraham praise be the Lord
[1:24:56] amen amen let me just read one quote and
[1:25:03] then we shall just continue mmm
[1:25:19] amen praise God
[1:25:29] the promise was made to Abraham and not
[1:25:33] only to Abraham but to his seed after
[1:25:36] him not in seeds but because he had many
[1:25:40] sons but only to one seed which came
[1:25:44] through Isaac through Isaac came Christ
[1:25:49] now we being dead in Christ we take on
[1:25:52] Abraham's seed and our health according
[1:25:56] the promise and I believe sensibly that
[1:26:00] I can provide the Bible that the seed of
[1:26:02] Abram are those who have been born again
[1:26:05] of the spirit of just Christ amen so you
[1:26:12] cannot claim to be the seed of Abram
[1:26:14] until you are born again by the Spirit
[1:26:18] of just rice
[1:26:21] amen that's right you have Abraham's
[1:26:26] seed when you have the Holy Ghost that's
[1:26:30] right it was through that promise and
[1:26:34] now that problem that promise was that
[1:26:37] he made or give to you by your own
[1:26:39] goodness it was God's election and
[1:26:43] according that brought you to it nothing
[1:26:47] we ever done to merit it you never
[1:26:50] sought after God it's God who thought
[1:26:53] after you and give it to you on the
[1:26:57] basis of sovereign grace nothing in the
[1:27:02] world that you could do nothing nothing
[1:27:04] that you could do praise God
[1:27:08] God called Abraham not because of what
[1:27:12] he did and not because of what was going
[1:27:16] to do but by God's sovereign grace and
[1:27:21] that's the way God has called us amen
[1:27:25] not because of what we have done or
[1:27:28] because of what we are going to do no is
[1:27:32] God working in us and for us who
[1:27:36] achieved his virtues it is not our
[1:27:39] effort these are our strengths but God
[1:27:42] is the one putting those virtues in us
[1:27:45] because it was has to be the seed of
[1:27:48] Abram and what did it Rob Rob he do to
[1:27:52] us also amen praise God amen
[1:28:00] so that God that made their covenant
[1:28:03] with Abram I believe was the Lord Jesus
[1:28:07] Christ amen
[1:28:11] praise the Lord he married a covenant
[1:28:14] and in the church age book the province
[1:28:17] Asia
[1:28:18] don't fear Little John don't fear little
[1:28:23] flock all that I am you are here too
[1:28:28] all my power is yours my open importance
[1:28:33] is yours as I stand in your ministry
[1:28:36] I've not come to bring fear and failure
[1:28:40] but love and courage and ability all
[1:28:45] power is given to me it's us Ruth you
[1:28:50] speak the word and I will perform it
[1:28:53] that's my covenant and if he can never
[1:28:57] fail amen
[1:29:01] so the very God who made a covenant with
[1:29:04] Abraham is making a covenant with with a
[1:29:08] bride in the Magna commoner with me are
[1:29:12] you
[1:29:13] hallelujah he told Graham and Michelle
[1:29:16] oh praise God I am everything for you do
[1:29:24] believe that brothers and that covenant
[1:29:27] is a part of you amen
[1:29:32] he has made a covenant with me he has
[1:29:35] made a covenant with you speak the word
[1:29:38] because all that God is it's yours as
[1:29:43] long as you come to realize who you are
[1:29:47] praise God amen praise His Holy Name
[1:29:53] Amen
[1:29:56] so Abraham had a promise of a son and we
[1:30:01] have a promise of eternal life in our
[1:30:05] right
[1:30:06] and Abraham amen he wanted to be sure of
[1:30:11] his promise and I must be sure of my
[1:30:15] promise
[1:30:18] amen if God gave me a promise I have to
[1:30:22] be sure of that promise then when the
[1:30:26] Bible says oh we must also make our
[1:30:30] calling and election sure amen that's
[1:30:38] why Abraham he wanted to be sure of in
[1:30:41] the promise and I must be sure of my
[1:30:44] promise I must make my calling and
[1:30:48] election sure hey man
[1:30:53] glory hallelujah oh let us live in the
[1:30:57] book of second Peter now oh praise God

[1:31:20] this eternal life praise God
[1:31:25] amen 2nd Peter chapter 1 and from verse
[1:31:30] 1 my god let us start from verse 2 grace
[1:31:42] and peace be multiplied until through
[1:31:44] their knowledge of God and of Jesus our

[1:31:52] as given unto us all things that pertain
[1:31:57] unto life and godliness through the
[1:32:02] knowledge of him that has called us to
[1:32:04] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[1:32:10] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:32:17] great and precious promises amen
[1:32:25] that by this is what these promises you
[1:32:30] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:32:33] having escaped the corruption does in
[1:32:37] the world through lust and beside this
[1:32:42] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:32:45] virtue and to virtue knowledge after
[1:32:51] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:32:54] patience and to patience godliness and
[1:32:58] to godliness brotherly kindness and
[1:33:00] little kindness charity so they were
[1:33:07] abused in the pyramid glory hallelujah

[1:33:33] they make you that he shall neither be
[1:33:37] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:33:40] of Allah Jesus Christ but he that
[1:33:44] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:33:48] see afar off and I'm forgotten that he
[1:33:52] was purged from the old dreams
[1:33:55] where a folder other brethren give
[1:33:58] diligence to make your calling and
[1:34:00] election sure for if you do these things
[1:34:05] you shall never fall praise God praise

[1:44:33] visited him
[1:44:35] in the person and then Lord in chapter
[1:44:39] 22 you tried him his love which was the
[1:44:46] type of Isaac going up the pyramid and
[1:44:51] Laurie said now in blessing
[1:44:54] I'll bless you and from that time you
[1:44:59] never spoke to Abram again and Lord our
[1:45:03] prophecies total obedience to the Holy
[1:45:07] Word of God and perilously token to be
[1:45:11] sealed by the Holy Spirit Lord God maybe

[1:45:21] virtues in as likely to Abraham
[1:45:25] my lord we need the sealing of the Holy

[1:45:55] keeping away the evil spirits from their
[1:45:59] sacrifice Lord when you give them they
[1:46:04] speak to ever where all the other clean
[1:46:09] parts of unbelief and cleanness speeds
[1:46:16] of doubt peace of confusion Lord may we
[1:46:22] wave them off from our sacrifice the
[1:46:28] Lord will lift up our hands to You Lord
[1:46:32] God in answer

[1:47:08] the seed of Abraham in the name of Jesus
[1:47:13] in you blood out of them they deserve
[1:47:15] their heart take away the spirit of
[1:47:19] unbelief or or server it is wrong

[1:47:28] because your promise to us but also very
[1:47:33] asking your name will grant it law and
[1:47:37] may you put every virtue in us like you
[1:47:42] need are to Abraham our Father the Lord

[1:48:06] perfect man if Jesus Christ no glory
[1:48:09] pray amen
[1:48:12] god bless you
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:25] praise the Lord
[1:48:28] we thank the law for their the word
[1:48:31] tonight gave me you appreciate the word
[1:48:35] tonight did we appreciate the word
[1:48:39] tonight a me praise award I think I have
[1:48:44] to look for my message let the church
[1:48:46] say Amy it's a messy data we're going to
[1:48:52] pre sometime ago
[1:48:56] I have to go back and look at that
[1:48:58] message praise the Lord but we thank the
[1:49:00] law to night for the word it's kind of a
[1:49:04] beautiful to see how placing the seventh
[1:49:11] virtue of Peter right into speaking to
[1:49:14] Abraham prays alone but there was
[1:49:18] something I want for us to watch Branham
[1:49:22] talks about dealing with Abraham Abraham
[1:49:28] he plays Genesis chapter 80 when the
[1:49:34] three men came to Abraham he placed
[1:49:37] there as the last visit which is the
[1:49:44] seventh visit praise Lord Amen so I
[1:49:50] believe by the Holy Spirit what brother
[1:49:53] Sammy was bringing it bringing to us
[1:49:55] tonight the way that God did with
[1:49:59] Abraham trying to show God dealing with
[1:50:03] us through the word because the virtue
[1:50:05] comes through the word amen the virtue
[1:50:09] it is now something that we can we can
[1:50:12] practice
[1:50:15] the same with God tested Abraham and God
[1:50:18] proof Abraham and God spoke to Abraham
[1:50:21] that's the same where else we are
[1:50:23] listing it to the word and we are
[1:50:25] learning from the word that's how we
[1:50:27] grow in a statue of a perfect man praise
[1:50:31] the Lord
[1:50:32] and it's just a friend I sent a coat up
[1:50:35] there from statute of the peasant man
[1:50:37] that's what better Brennan feels the
[1:50:39] world crumble
[1:50:40] you know Samuel spoke on that but see
[1:50:44] what brother Branham said you know where
[1:50:47] Branham said they statue will crumble
[1:50:50] when you try to put your thing in it
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:57] that's when the statue crumble he says I
[1:51:01] see after you have done all year and
[1:51:04] come here now you are coming into a
[1:51:08] force touch you now of a son of God but
[1:51:12] you have got to have this plus all this
[1:51:15] and you can even start until you get
[1:51:19] this now you
[1:51:23] you remember the black bird with T crow
[1:51:29] feather and what is that it's when a
[1:51:32] black bird starts with a peacock feather
[1:51:34] and start to add it and the bird don't
[1:51:38] add its feather the feather comes from
[1:51:41] the food its eat amen so he said P crow
[1:51:46] feather don't forget that see don't try
[1:51:49] to add it until you are actually born
[1:51:52] again because that's where it starts
[1:51:55] from praise the Lord you can make it
[1:52:00] work it will come to this it will come
[1:52:04] here it will crumble
[1:52:07] praise the Lord and we crumble when when
[1:52:11] we start having make-believe we start
[1:52:15] putting our own attitude to what God is
[1:52:17] - and remember now we started speaking
[1:52:19] on the word you can net you cannot miss
[1:52:23] interpret what God is doing
[1:52:25] you cannot misplace what God is doing we
[1:52:30] have to believe God's Word that God said
[1:52:32] it I believe it and that's a - it Amen
[1:52:37] God said it and we receive God's Word
[1:52:40] when we starts to act then you put your
[1:52:44] pull what God want to do your sport God
[1:52:47] creation
[1:52:51] are we together but I think it was
[1:52:55] beautiful tonight to be able to see God
[1:52:58] the way God dealt with Abraham and
[1:53:00] Abraham was able to grow in in a statue
[1:53:04] of a perfect man praise the Lord I was
[1:53:07] sitting there I was listening and and
[1:53:11] you know I was taking the Scriptures
[1:53:14] down all the time - I was speaking to
[1:53:16] Abraham but when he got to brotherly
[1:53:19] kindness I said it's jumping over
[1:53:22] Genesis chapter 18 but then I sat and I
[1:53:28] said okay I see where he's going now
[1:53:30] he's talking about the virtue he's not
[1:53:33] talking about the seven appearance
[1:53:39] praise the Lord are we together amen so
[1:53:43] we thank the Lord for the word tonight
