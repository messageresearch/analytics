[41:29] for him. So we just we just want to be
[41:33] grateful to the Lord. Amen. uh for
[41:35] watching over each and every one of us.
[41:40] Uh we want to remind ourself we have a
[41:43] communion service this evening at 400
[41:45] pm. will be back here
[41:48] uh for the evening service and also we
[41:53] have a Easter services on on on the
[41:56] Easter weekend and uh I was not really
[42:01] sure what to do because uh
[42:08] uh this would be
[42:11] uh
[42:14] almost 20 years
[42:17] ago, our brother Dele and myself, we did
[42:21] some meetings over in Delbin, South
[42:24] Africa and uh uh and the brothers were
[42:28] they are planning to have brother Del.
[42:31] So uh one of the brother contacted me
[42:34] and was asking if I could come for for
[42:37] the Easter
[42:39] meeting since uh we came together that
[42:42] time and I was just caught in between
[42:44] whether I want to travel or not a fair
[42:47] mode of staying home than traveling. So
[42:50] I I really couldn't sign up for what to
[42:53] do on Easter.
[42:55] So I knew the other uh what I was gone
[42:59] or not that we would have some form of
[43:01] Easter services on the weekend. And then
[43:05] uh uh just because I couldn't really
[43:09] make up my mind whether I would travel
[43:11] or not. I was a little bit slow of
[43:13] letting you know what we would do on
[43:15] Easter weekend. Well, as the law will
[43:18] have it, brother
[43:22] uh
[43:23] Crosby uh Malleo from uh the UK, he was
[43:27] with us two years ago and uh uh he will
[43:31] be doing a wedding in Florida
[43:34] uh the weekend before Easter. So, he
[43:37] called me to let me know he will be in
[43:40] the States. So, I said, "Oh, yeah. I
[43:42] heard you'll be coming uh to do uh that
[43:45] wedding." a sister from his church. He's
[43:47] getting married there. So,
[43:49] uh so in in in uh in chance of talking
[43:54] then he asked me, "Oh, what are you
[43:56] doing for Easter?" I says, "Well, I I'm
[43:58] not traveling. I will be home." He says,
[44:00] "Well, okay. Since I will be in the
[44:02] States, maybe I will come and visit with
[44:04] you." I said, "Well, okay. Let's see how
[44:06] that will work." He said, "Well, I will
[44:07] get back to you." And then he called me
[44:10] uh I think some part of last week. He
[44:12] and his wife will be coming. So, we will
[44:14] have
[44:15] uh brother Crosby uh that weekend we'll
[44:18] have a Saturday night service and the
[44:20] Sunday morning that will that will be
[44:23] what we will do for Easter and uh
[44:28] uh we will bring greetings from uh
[44:30] brother Robert Wilson over in Chicago.
[44:33] He returned back from from Chad. He went
[44:37] on a missionary journey to Chad. I love
[44:40] brother Robert and uh uh I mean just his
[44:45] conviction, his burden, you know, he
[44:48] looks like a oneman
[44:50] soldier and uh and all the things that
[44:53] he's doing there. But he was telling me
[44:56] uh uh the Lord really blessed his trip
[44:58] this time. They uh they went down into
[45:02] the village of Chad and uh they got
[45:06] about uh about 60 plus people baptized
[45:10] in one of the villages there and then
[45:13] they went to another small village and
[45:16] they got uh some group of people
[45:18] baptized there also. So the chief of the
[45:21] village asked that uh the next time he
[45:23] come he going to baptize me. So I think
[45:26] that is a that is a that is a way to put
[45:29] in request to come back you know praise
[45:32] the Lord. But he was telling me uh uh
[45:35] what stood out to him on the trip was
[45:37] that they were returning back uh uh and
[45:41] then uh they were traveling through the
[45:43] night. So, this was almost about 1:30
[45:45] 2:00 a.m. in the morning. And while they
[45:49] were driving, you know, pitch black and
[45:53] uh uh there were two men that was
[45:55] standing right in the middle of the road
[45:58] just because the overhead bridge or the
[46:01] bridge across the river
[46:04] broke. So, if those men were not there,
[46:07] they were going to drive right into the
[46:09] river.
[46:10] So the man stopped them and told them
[46:12] the bridge is broke and they you know
[46:15] they have to use another road guided
[46:17] them and uh and then he said and he
[46:21] never thought anything of it and he was
[46:24] very grateful that the Lord provided
[46:26] somebody there but then one of the
[46:28] brothers the brother was telling he says
[46:30] brother it's strange you know uh that
[46:32] even the men that that gather us they
[46:35] never had light you know no touch light
[46:38] how you So uh and uh uh I mean when we
[46:43] drove taking another direction, I tried
[46:46] to look back to see where where these
[46:48] where these guys came from, you know,
[46:50] because he thought those were arm
[46:52] robbers, you know, that was trying to
[46:54] stop them and rob them, but it turned
[46:57] out to be
[46:58] that it was their savior trying to stop
[47:01] them and save them. Amen. And uh so he
[47:05] just said, "Well, you know, I I I never
[47:08] thought much about it, but I just want
[47:10] to thank the Lord for, you know, making
[47:12] provision and and saving us from from
[47:16] that uh what could have been a terrible
[47:19] terrible accident. Praise the Lord."
[47:23] Amen. During the week, uh uh we
[47:27] announced uh the home gloring of Brother
[47:29] Samuel Johnson. I think uh the family
[47:33] did veering on Friday and plan to do
[47:37] private burial and uh but while we were
[47:41] while we were
[47:43] texting and people brothers were sending
[47:46] their condolence, brother Ron Spencer
[47:50] uh uh sent his condolence and then in
[47:53] his condolence he dropped a testimony
[47:56] and I thought that I'll share that with
[47:58] you. It be a blessing this morning. He
[48:01] said just to share the testimony with
[48:03] you all a show many has heard. I had my
[48:09] usual brain
[48:11] scan this
[48:13] year for the first time in five
[48:17] years. It was clean.
[48:22] The doctor replied, "What a miracle."
[48:28] May this be the first of many skin that
[48:31] will have uh that I will have. We have a
[48:36] living supernatural God.
[48:40] They gave me four
[48:42] months when we started. Now is five
[48:46] years later.
[48:48] I have a clear brain scan. Praise God.
[49:02] Praise the Lord. Glory to God.
[49:06] What a wonderful Jesus we serve. I sure
[49:10] believe that there would have been an
[49:11] encouragement. Amen. So I couldn't keep
[49:14] it to
[49:15] myself. I rather share it with us all.
[49:18] And uh you know as I was as I read the
[49:22] the the testimony and uh you know uh
[49:26] give God praise in my own way. But then
[49:29] I was just thinking about it. I was just
[49:31] thinking about it, you know, uh
[49:36] uh how the Lord has used brother Ron
[49:40] Spencer condition
[49:42] to be a blessing for his people for the
[49:47] bride of Jesus Christ around the world
[49:50] in so much they are there. uh you know
[49:53] uh he has a he had a brain tumor, he had
[49:56] a lungs tumor, he almost had his entire
[49:59] body with uh uh you know uh cancer
[50:03] tumor and uh but yet in the midst of
[50:07] that
[50:09] uh you know uh
[50:12] uh brother has been preaching
[50:16] and uh he's just been goring. Praise the
[50:19] Lord. you know, the Lord has been giving
[50:21] him strength to go. He's just been
[50:23] going, doing, you know, the best that he
[50:26] can for the Lord.
[50:28] And uh
[50:31] uh as I was thinking about it, in my
[50:35] mind I was thinking I was saying
[50:39] uh you know when a
[50:40] man or a
[50:42] woman give their body to the Lord,
[50:45] dedicate themselves to the Lord. I just
[50:48] believe that the Lord choose to use our
[50:50] brother's body that he's the God that
[50:53] heal our diseases.
[50:55] Amen.
[50:57] And uh uh I
[50:59] mean with that the Lord has has put
[51:03] brother Ron in in such a place where his
[51:06] ministry has been tremendous you know
[51:09] healing discernments and uh I mean just
[51:12] just a beautiful beautiful uh piece of
[51:15] gift that God has given to to his
[51:18] people. So we thank the Lord for that.
[51:20] Amen. We thank the Lord for that. We
[51:24] thank the Lord for that. you know when
[51:26] when we have uh uh illnesses or or
[51:30] whatever we deal with is one or two
[51:32] things and and sometimes we don't get to
[51:35] see that sometimes the Lord allow it for
[51:38] his glory
[51:40] you know and when God allow it for his
[51:42] glory he's going to use it for his glory
[51:45] praise the Lord amen and when there is
[51:48] something for the glory of God and we
[51:50] try to draw it into our pity you know to
[51:53] you know to to beg for hatred and cry
[51:56] for mercy. You we just missing the
[51:59] purpose, you know, we just missing the
[52:02] purpose. So we, you know, it's it's it's
[52:04] really good to be able to find find the
[52:07] word of God and understand, you know,
[52:09] what, you know, what what the Lord will
[52:11] be doing in that very moment. And uh and
[52:15] then it become a blessing to you and
[52:17] then it become a blessing to everybody
[52:19] that is around you. Praise the Lord. And
[52:22] I think uh that's that's that's
[52:24] beautiful. So we thank the Lord for
[52:26] that. Amen. He's a mighty God that we
[52:28] serve. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless
[52:32] you, Elijah. Good to see you. Amen. Good
[52:35] to see you.
[52:39] Uh and
[52:47] uh there was some other things that were
[52:49] on my mind. Where have they
[52:53] gone? Praise the Lord. But uh the Lord
[52:57] bless you. Let's just stand on our feet.
[52:59] Uh uh okay. Uh I mean what what I wanted
[53:02] to say that uh for for those that were
[53:05] here uh for our our Sunday school tape
[53:08] this morning, we played uh uh Owens
[53:12] Jurgens in Supernatural on the life of

[53:18] that this morning. uh as as a tribute to
[53:24] uh to to brother Brandham
[53:27] uh instead of playing uh live story I
[53:30] choose to play there uh since today is
[53:33] brother Brandham's birthday or it will
[53:35] have been his birthday. Praise the Lord.
[53:37] So I thought we'll play something that

[53:42] birth and uh uh so that was the reason
[53:46] why we played that this morning. Amen.

[1:03:46] brother Fintech in Alaska and uh uh

[1:03:52] yesterday and he wanted me to send his
[1:03:55] greetings. I know there's another person
[1:03:58] in uh in the back part of my mind, but
[1:04:00] this morning I want to talk on a subject
[1:04:03] uh a word, a Hebrew word that caught my
[1:04:06] mind. Akidan is a Hebrew word that
[1:04:10] caught my mind during the week. I was I
[1:04:13] was uh uh studying and then uh reading
[1:04:16] something. That word caught my mind and
[1:04:20] uh uh I was just listening to to
[1:04:23] something and I went back and and
[1:04:25] started reading uh studying on the word.
[1:04:28] The word actually means bounding. It
[1:04:30] means bounding. You know the something
[1:04:33] that bounds together. And uh so we we
[1:04:36] want to go to Genesis chapter 22.
[1:04:39] Genesis chapter 22. That's where our
[1:04:41] reading will be from this morning.
[1:04:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:46] Amen. That's that's that's where our
[1:04:49] reading will be from this
[1:04:51] morning. And uh um I hope I can be able
[1:04:55] to to uh bring to you this morning just
[1:04:59] the way that it was a blessing to me. If
[1:05:02] not, I will try the best that I can.
[1:05:04] Praise the Lord. Amen. Genesis chapter
[1:05:08] 22 and uh
[1:05:13] uh bounding
[1:05:17] Akidel
[1:05:20] Aikidel Genesis chapter 22. Let's just
[1:05:24] read u uh because there's a whole lot
[1:05:27] here in Genesis chapter 22 that we want.
[1:05:30] But let's read from verse 1 to8. Praise
[1:05:33] the Lord. And it came to pass after
[1:05:35] these things that God did tempt Abra
[1:05:37] Abraham and said unto him, Abraham, and
[1:05:41] he said, Behold, here I am. And uh he
[1:05:45] said, "Take now thy son,
[1:05:49] thine ownest son Isaac, whom thy loveth,
[1:05:54] and get thee into the land of Moriah,
[1:05:58] and offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:06:01] upon one of the mountains, which I will
[1:06:04] tell thee of." And Abraham arose up uh
[1:06:08] early in the morning and saddled his
[1:06:10] eyes and took two of his young men with
[1:06:13] him and Isaac his son and uh and clip
[1:06:17] the wood for the burnt offering and rose
[1:06:21] up and went onto the place of which God
[1:06:25] had told him. Then on the third day
[1:06:29] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:06:33] place a far off. And Abraham said unto
[1:06:37] his young men, "Abide year, abide ye
[1:06:41] year, wave the eyes, and I and the lad
[1:06:44] will go yonder and worship and come
[1:06:47] again unto you." And Abraham took the
[1:06:50] wood and the burnt offering and laid it
[1:06:53] upon Isaac his son. And he took the fire
[1:06:58] in his hands and the knife. And they and
[1:07:02] they went
[1:07:03] both of them together. And Isaac speak
[1:07:06] unto Abraham his father and said, "My
[1:07:09] father." And he answered,
[1:07:12] "Yeah, my son." And he said, "Behold the
[1:07:15] fire and the wood, but where is the lamb
[1:07:18] for a burnt offering?" And Abraham said,
[1:07:22] "My son, God will
[1:07:26] provide himself." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:32] Let us pray. Father, bless your word. As
[1:07:36] we want to just get right into it now,
[1:07:38] we just ask that father, you will uh
[1:07:41] come out of the pages of your word,
[1:07:42] Father. Lord and speak to our hearts,
[1:07:45] Lord, things of internal value this
[1:07:47] morning. We love you. We appreciate you
[1:07:50] in Jesus name. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:53] Let's go there back to that verse eight.
[1:07:55] You can have your seat. And Abraham
[1:07:58] said, "My son, God will
[1:08:02] provide
[1:08:04] himself."
[1:08:06] Now read that slowly. Read that with
[1:08:13] attention. God will
[1:08:17] provide
[1:08:22] himself. Not God will provide for
[1:08:25] himself but God will provide
[1:08:32] himself. Is that are you getting it?
[1:08:38] Not God will provide for
[1:08:40] himself but God will provide
[1:08:48] himself. God will give
[1:08:52] himself. That's the meaning I want to
[1:08:54] bring to
[1:08:55] you. God is going to give
[1:09:02] himself. Praise the
[1:09:04] Lord. Amen.
[1:09:07] not provide for
[1:09:09] himself, not give something else, but
[1:09:13] he's going to give
[1:09:17] himself. Now, that's where I want I want
[1:09:20] us to be able to see the
[1:09:23] bounding. I want us to be able to see
[1:09:26] the
[1:09:29] arkine is uh is is is more than the way
[1:09:34] we think about it.
[1:09:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:38] Amen. It's more than the way that we
[1:09:42] think about it. It's more than the way
[1:09:43] that we say it. You know, Jehovah Gara,
[1:09:46] the Lord will provide. We just caught a
[1:09:48] shot. The Lord will provide.
[1:09:51] But when you look into the text as we as
[1:09:53] we read and I I would tell you I mean uh
[1:09:56] just looking at it this way it just it
[1:09:59] just opened a complete
[1:10:01] different I mean a complete different
[1:10:04] view to me of Genesis chapter 22 and
[1:10:07] that's what we want to look into this
[1:10:08] morning. Amen. God will provide
[1:10:14] himself. God give us
[1:10:17] himself not a second person.
[1:10:21] Not a third person. It was himself.
[1:10:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:31] Amen. When Adam fell in the Garden of
[1:10:34] Eden, God never sent a second person.
[1:10:38] God came down himself.
[1:10:44] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:10:47] that was to reconcile
[1:10:49] man. Genesis chapter 22 is a picture of
[1:10:56] Calvary. Are we
[1:10:59] together? Praise the
[1:11:01] Lord. So God will give himself to redeem
[1:11:07] us
[1:11:07] back. Praise the
[1:11:09] Lord. He gave himself to reconcile us.
[1:11:13] He gave himself to redeem us. And Paul
[1:11:17] in Thessalonians says the Lord himself
[1:11:20] shall descend. Right?
[1:11:24] So himself reconcile us, himself redeem
[1:11:28] us, himself will descend to take us back
[1:11:32] home.
[1:11:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:42] God
[1:11:44] himself. God will give
[1:11:51] himself. Praise the
[1:11:54] Lord. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:11:57] But let's go back. Let's go back to uh
[1:12:00] to the beginning of the of the chapter
[1:12:02] that we just read. Now you see uh this
[1:12:05] word this word akida this bonding word
[1:12:09] that's word uh uh in the Bible when the
[1:12:12] Bible says if two agree upon
[1:12:16] anything you know if two agree upon
[1:12:19] anything now you have to you have to
[1:12:22] realize that uh James said uh we ask in
[1:12:27] a mix that's why we don't get what we
[1:12:30] what we ask for. Amen. And sometimes
[1:12:34] that is the way our bounding is. Is it
[1:12:37] cold in
[1:12:41] here? Okay.
[1:12:44] So yeah, the way I see you folding and
[1:12:48] uh covering so I think uh uh our our
[1:12:54] trustees will help us with that or
[1:12:57] deacons whoever just give us a little
[1:12:59] bit heat. Don't put us on fire.
[1:13:03] just give us a little bit warmness.
[1:13:06] Amen. Oh, I miss pray Lord. He will have
[1:13:09] you all stand up right now and start
[1:13:12] doing higher higher just to make your
[1:13:15] blood start running in your
[1:13:19] vein. Oh
[1:13:21] man, it's a young man that is dear to my
[1:13:24] heart. Praise the Lord. So, well, uh
[1:13:26] that's that's where that that comes
[1:13:29] from. two will agree on anything. And uh
[1:13:33] uh you will see also in the scripture
[1:13:35] Jesus said uh uh uh what whatever you
[1:13:41] bound on
[1:13:42] earth is bound in
[1:13:45] heaven. Praise the Lord. Now you see the
[1:13:49] on on a on a coveting
[1:13:52] uh uh the coveting is based on the
[1:13:57] seriousness of the people. I was talking
[1:14:00] with a brother recently and we were just
[1:14:02] talking about one you know some few
[1:14:04] things and just fellowshipping together
[1:14:07] and uh you know uh you know as we're
[1:14:09] looking into so I I I throw a scenario
[1:14:12] before him and and uh and we were
[1:14:14] talking about we were just talking about
[1:14:16] some some marriage cases and marriage
[1:14:18] condition and then I asked the brother I
[1:14:20] say so how do we judge a a vow that is
[1:14:23] not in good
[1:14:25] faith and uh uh and you know he was
[1:14:29] talking and and as he was going on he
[1:14:31] was just uh uh saying some things to me
[1:14:35] and then he was paraphrasing something
[1:14:37] brother Brandham said you know to be
[1:14:39] able to bring me to this place then he
[1:14:42] mentioned the word
[1:14:44] intention I says that's my
[1:14:47] kid I told him I says that's what I have
[1:14:50] always
[1:14:51] used because you see
[1:14:54] uh uh uh when two persons make an
[1:14:58] agreement
[1:15:01] Amen. Our
[1:15:04] intentions can make that agreement
[1:15:07] stronger.
[1:15:10] Our intention can also make that
[1:15:12] agreement to be deceitful.
[1:15:16] Praise the Lord. When a man has a good
[1:15:19] intention, he's going to put all into
[1:15:23] it. He's going to know that I make this
[1:15:26] agreement. I must I will stand by it or
[1:15:29] I will die by it.
[1:15:33] Praise the Lord. But when your intention
[1:15:36] is not good, it influence your attitude.
[1:15:43] Praise the Lord. When a person intention
[1:15:46] is not right, it influence their
[1:15:50] attitude. What am I preaching this
[1:15:52] morning? Not marriage and divorce
[1:15:54] though. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:57] Amen. I'm preaching the
[1:15:59] aid. Let me make sure that I stay on on
[1:16:02] on text here. Amen. Now, so you see uh a
[1:16:07] and that's that's where this thing is.
[1:16:10] The Bible says he could swear by no one
[1:16:13] else. He swore by
[1:16:17] himself. God hold himself responsible to
[1:16:21] bring his word to
[1:16:23] pass. Praise the Lord. You see, he's the
[1:16:26] God of accountability. He's not a
[1:16:29] blaming God. He don't blame the people.
[1:16:32] The people are up on earth. They're too
[1:16:33] lazy. They are backsliding. They are not
[1:16:36] serious. If God made a promise, he hold
[1:16:39] himself responsible to make sure that
[1:16:42] that promise come to pass.
[1:16:49] Praise the Lord. Amen. And that is the
[1:16:52] same reason why when we make a promise,
[1:16:57] when we use God's
[1:16:59] word to establish an
[1:17:05] agreement, we must hold our life to it.
[1:17:10] Praise the Lord. When we agree that
[1:17:12] wheresoever two or three were gathered
[1:17:15] and we agree together, we must hold
[1:17:18] ourself responsible.
[1:17:25] Are we
[1:17:26] together? Well, we come today. Let's
[1:17:29] just fellowship a little bit here. I'm
[1:17:31] getting excited.
[1:17:36] Amen. When I get excited, I get
[1:17:41] loud. Glory be to
[1:17:45] God. Then my girl says, "Daddy, what are
[1:17:47] you mad?" I say, "I'm excited.
[1:17:53] Daddy, what are you
[1:17:55] m I'm excited? Let's let's look here
[1:17:58] together verse one again in in chapter
[1:18:00] 22. Then it came to pass there there are
[1:18:03] some very beautiful beautiful gems right
[1:18:05] here in this chapter. It came to pass
[1:18:08] after these things after what you
[1:18:11] remember we we we took a while in the
[1:18:13] scripture looking at after these things
[1:18:16] something has happened. Okay, you can go
[1:18:19] back and look at
[1:18:21] that. That God tempted Abraham and said
[1:18:24] unto
[1:18:26] Abraham and and and and and said unto
[1:18:30] him, Abraham, and he said, behold, yeah,
[1:18:32] I
[1:18:33] am. And he said, take now thy
[1:18:38] son, thine own son. As I was studying
[1:18:43] this, you will realize that uh it's is
[1:18:46] it's beautiful. Uh uh three times in
[1:18:50] this chapter God use thine own son.
[1:18:53] Three times he used that thy son thy
[1:18:57] only son is is is an emphasis. Amen.
[1:19:00] Praise the Lord. It's an emphasis.
[1:19:03] Somebody says something it make me
[1:19:05] laugh. He says uh you know uh do you
[1:19:08] realize every time God speak to a man in
[1:19:10] the scripture he had to re-emphasize it
[1:19:13] because men don't hear the first
[1:19:15] time. Amen.
[1:19:17] Men don't hear the first time. You got
[1:19:19] to tell them more than
[1:19:23] once. Three times God emphasized that uh
[1:19:27] uh thy only son. Now there is something
[1:19:31] uh that is called the law of first
[1:19:33] mention.
[1:19:35] When you read it, when you're reading
[1:19:37] the word of God, you'll realize they are
[1:19:39] the sometimes the places where certain
[1:19:43] words are mentioned the first
[1:19:45] time, it hold a very great significance.
[1:19:50] Praise the Lord. Amen. The first time
[1:19:54] the word pleasure will be used in the
[1:19:56] Bible is when Sarah will say, "I'm old.
[1:20:00] Will I have pleasure with my with my
[1:20:02] Lord Abraham?" That's the first time
[1:20:05] that word pleasure will be used in the
[1:20:07] Bible. And now when you look here into
[1:20:10] this into this uh chapter, you will
[1:20:13] realize uh uh uh on his son D on his
[1:20:17] son. That's this is the first time is
[1:20:18] used and three times used in this
[1:20:20] chapter. Not not that one is not too
[1:20:23] strong to me. But you will also see here
[1:20:27] the Bible says that take thy only son uh
[1:20:30] uh uh uh take now thy son thy only son
[1:20:34] whom thy loveth. That's the first time
[1:20:37] the word love is used in the
[1:20:42] Bible. Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the
[1:20:46] first time the word love is used. Don't
[1:20:49] you see the the the beauty uh of the
[1:20:53] design of of of of God's mind? Praise
[1:20:57] the Lord. Amen. Love is expressed in
[1:21:01] different way. When God came down and
[1:21:03] say, "Adam, Adam, where are you?" It was
[1:21:05] God's love for them. Are we together?
[1:21:09] But the first time the word love is
[1:21:12] spelled out and used in our English
[1:21:15] Bible is in Genesis chapter 22. You can
[1:21:18] check that out if you find it before
[1:21:20] then you let me know now. So but the the
[1:21:24] beauty here is that uh you will see that
[1:21:27] before h behind this action behind what
[1:21:31] is taking place here in uh in Genesis
[1:21:34] chapter 2 God had a a a deep thought in
[1:21:38] his
[1:21:39] mind. The scene that he's building here,
[1:21:42] the scene that he's designing here is
[1:21:46] all
[1:21:48] about his internal
[1:21:51] purpose.
[1:21:53] Amen. His love for you and
[1:21:57] myself. Are we together?
[1:22:05] We have to realize that he's this great
[1:22:08] intent of God that you know that that
[1:22:10] that that fill all space and time you
[1:22:13] know and and uh and uh I mean uh
[1:22:18] uh he dwelt alone and and uh uh uh
[1:22:22] intended spirit but for him to be able
[1:22:26] to start to uh uh a time of creation
[1:22:30] start creation it was All because his
[1:22:34] expression of
[1:22:37] love he wanted to display his
[1:22:41] attribute.
[1:22:44] Amen. The Lord of first mention thine
[1:22:47] own son and also whom thou loveth.
[1:22:51] That's the first time is used in the
[1:22:53] Bible. Are we together?
[1:22:57] And then when you look look at the scene
[1:23:00] also the Bible says God is telling
[1:23:04] Abraham
[1:23:05] here take thy son whom thou loveth get
[1:23:10] thee to the land of Moriah and offer him
[1:23:13] there for a burnt offering upon one of
[1:23:17] the mountain which I will tell thee.
[1:23:20] Praise the Lord. And Abraham rose up
[1:23:24] early in the morning. So if we look at
[1:23:27] that scene, God spoke to him that night.
[1:23:31] Was it a dream? Was it a vision? But he
[1:23:34] knew because he was a man that was that
[1:23:37] was that that was on speaking terms with
[1:23:39] God. Amen. So he knew it was the voice
[1:23:42] of God. God spoke to him that night. The
[1:23:45] Bible says early in the morning, he rose
[1:23:48] up to set up.
[1:23:51] Now, so when when you look at that, what
[1:23:55] I see in that picture is that uh uh uh
[1:23:59] uh uh that instruction from God affected
[1:24:03] Abraham so much and Abraham took it
[1:24:07] serious, glory be to God, that he woke
[1:24:11] up early in the morning, no wasting
[1:24:13] time. But this is what I want to bring
[1:24:16] also out of that is that as far as
[1:24:20] Abraham was
[1:24:22] concerned Isaac was
[1:24:26] dead.
[1:24:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. Isaac was dead in
[1:24:32] Abraham mind because God
[1:24:36] told Abraham, "Offer your son, your only
[1:24:40] son." Abraham did not say it to Sarah.
[1:24:44] He never said it to the two young men
[1:24:46] that went with him. He never even said
[1:24:48] it to Isaac. He had it in his heart.
[1:24:53] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now the reason
[1:24:56] why I'm saying this, you're going to see
[1:24:58] that because when Abraham took off here
[1:25:02] chapter I mean verse four will tell us
[1:25:05] that on then on the third day Abraham
[1:25:10] lifted up his eyes and saw the place far
[1:25:13] off. Now the reason why I'm making that
[1:25:16] emphasis is because right lay in this
[1:25:20] chapter is one of the three days scene
[1:25:23] of the death burial and
[1:25:27] resurrection. Praise the
[1:25:30] Lord. So when God spoke to Abraham, when
[1:25:34] God commanded Abraham, Isaac was dead in
[1:25:37] his mind.
[1:25:40] Abraham went three days
[1:25:46] Praise the Lord. Are we together? Are
[1:25:50] you seeing the picture? Is is is God uh
[1:25:54] uh you know uh uh uh designing for
[1:25:57] telling us of what he was going to
[1:26:01] do? Are we
[1:26:04] together? So we see the the the the the
[1:26:08] only begotten son. We see the the the
[1:26:11] thine ownest son. We see God whom thy
[1:26:15] loveth. He's expressing thy ownest son
[1:26:18] who you
[1:26:19] love. And then we also seeing a three
[1:26:22] days
[1:26:24] journey. Praise the
[1:26:27] Lord. So on the tear then they identify
[1:26:30] the mountain. They got on top of the
[1:26:33] mountain and uh uh the altar was
[1:26:37] set and Isaac is saying everything is
[1:26:40] ready. Father, where is the
[1:26:43] sacrifice? Praise the Lord. Where is the
[1:26:47] lamb for the burnt offering? That's
[1:26:50] verse seven. And Abraham said, "My son,
[1:26:54] God will provide himself."
[1:26:58] God will provide
[1:27:01] himself. Praise the Lord. Amen. He will
[1:27:05] provide himself a
[1:27:09] lamb. It's so
[1:27:12] subtle that it's easy to see the lamb
[1:27:15] and not to see that God become the lamb.
[1:27:22] Are we together?
[1:27:23] It's easy to see the lamb and it's is uh
[1:27:26] you know what it's hidden right there is
[1:27:29] God providing
[1:27:33] himself God giving
[1:27:36] himself. Praise the Lord. So you see it
[1:27:40] that when the three days journeying they
[1:27:42] got on top of the mountain Abraham bind
[1:27:45] the son he took the knife and the angel
[1:27:48] held his hand. So when Isaac came up
[1:27:51] from the altar, it was the resurrection.
[1:27:59] Praise the Lord. When Isaiah came when
[1:28:02] he lifted up from the altar to sit up
[1:28:05] because a ram was uh crying there or
[1:28:08] bleeding there in in in the ticket, that
[1:28:11] was the
[1:28:17] resurrection. Are we together?
[1:28:22] God provide himself. He gave himself in
[1:28:26] Eden to reconcile man. He gave himself
[1:28:31] uh uh on Calvary to redeem man. And the
[1:28:35] Lord himself will descend with a shout.
[1:28:39] Praise the Lord. The Lord himself will
[1:28:42] descend. The Lord will give himself
[1:28:49] Are we together? So you see this is a
[1:28:52] it's a it's a it's a very it's a very
[1:28:55] serious very very important thing.
[1:28:59] Amen. It's a bounding
[1:29:04] thing. And that's what I want to dwell
[1:29:06] on this uh uh you know this this
[1:29:09] morning. If you if you remember back uh
[1:29:13] uh I was I was looking at my note
[1:29:15] because I was looking for this quote
[1:29:17] that was back in uh 2019 2018 where we
[1:29:20] spoke on the bounding power. We spoke on
[1:29:23] the bounding power and and we read this
[1:29:26] from the uh uh sadician age. Uh I want
[1:29:29] to read it again. Satan is the greatest
[1:29:32] uh
[1:29:37] uh what is
[1:29:40] that surface? He has never been overcome
[1:29:46] in stripes of
[1:29:48] words. In divine service, the words of
[1:29:52] men are usually heard more than the
[1:29:54] words of God.
[1:29:57] each one chatter as he please or kill
[1:30:03] time by learn by learn uh uh
[1:30:08] discreision and disproving the views of
[1:30:12] others of the new birth and how a man
[1:30:16] must be changed into the likeness of
[1:30:20] Christ to become a partaker of his
[1:30:23] divine nature.
[1:30:25] Scarcely anything is
[1:30:27] said. Praise the Lord. Now, I've carried
[1:30:31] this for many, many years because it has
[1:30:33] been very, very important to me. Amen.
[1:30:36] Praise the Lord. Because I mean, we can
[1:30:39] line up quotes. We can, you know, we can
[1:30:42] put our PowerPoint and put verses and
[1:30:45] and you know, and just show you where
[1:30:47] the scripture says it, show you where
[1:30:49] brother Brandham says it and show you
[1:30:51] and and then sometimes it can just be
[1:30:54] all to the place of just showing you how
[1:30:56] much I have studied on this subject
[1:31:01] and far from the reality of you
[1:31:04] connecting with the word
[1:31:07] because you see God's
[1:31:10] interest is to connect with you. That's
[1:31:13] the bounding power.
[1:31:16] Praise the Lord. Amen. His interest is
[1:31:20] to connect with
[1:31:25] us. He's not the God that uh that that
[1:31:29] is sitting in his in in in heaven on his
[1:31:31] throne in the way that the church want
[1:31:34] us to see. You see, because the the the
[1:31:37] the the way it has been presented to
[1:31:41] us, it has not given us enough fear for
[1:31:46] God because he's left in church. He's in
[1:31:50] heaven above. Praise the Lord. He's seen
[1:31:54] so much of a
[1:31:56] distance that if we can be so smart,
[1:31:59] there are things we can do and and you
[1:32:02] know when we get to church, we can meet
[1:32:03] him at church and settle it
[1:32:06] there. But that's not the God that we
[1:32:08] serve. Amen.
[1:32:12] He's a living God that is living among
[1:32:14] his people. He promised, I will never
[1:32:18] leave you. I will never forsake you. I
[1:32:20] will be with you. I'm even desiring to
[1:32:23] be in you.
[1:32:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. That's how much
[1:32:30] his interest is to us. That's how much
[1:32:33] close he want to be. That's how much
[1:32:37] bounding that God want to
[1:32:41] be. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:45] So you see the the the the the the ike
[1:32:48] there when when when when God made this
[1:32:51] promise, he was bounding himself. God
[1:32:55] will provide
[1:32:57] himself. Not provide for himself. He
[1:33:01] will provide
[1:33:03] himself. Are we together?
[1:33:07] He will give himself. He he he bound
[1:33:10] himself by his word. He bind himself by
[1:33:13] his promise. If he made a promise, he
[1:33:16] will follow it through. He's not leaving
[1:33:18] it up to you to figure it out. He will
[1:33:21] back that promise up by his presence.
[1:33:28] Are we together?
[1:33:32] of the new birth and how men must be
[1:33:35] changed into the likeness of
[1:33:37] Christ to become partakers of the divine
[1:33:41] nature. Scarcely anything is said of the
[1:33:47] power of the keys that was given to
[1:33:50] Peter, the keys of the church. The
[1:33:53] church has almost lost the power of
[1:33:58] bounding. Praise the Lord.
[1:34:01] Amen. That's what make our churches the
[1:34:04] way they are in this time that we are
[1:34:06] living in. Because man has not seen what
[1:34:11] the aid is. They have not seen the the
[1:34:14] the level of
[1:34:17] commitment. Praise the
[1:34:19] Lord. The level of commitment. That's
[1:34:23] the reason why Genesis chapter 15, God
[1:34:26] will come down and and and and and you
[1:34:29] know uh make a covenant with Abraham and
[1:34:31] and uh and and the principle of covenant
[1:34:34] will we we will be taught that how it
[1:34:37] was was that uh uh they take an animal
[1:34:40] they kill the animal and the two men
[1:34:42] that is agreeing on that covenant stand
[1:34:46] in the middle of the dead animal on
[1:34:48] their both side. Amen.
[1:34:51] They are making a
[1:34:54] covenant that if we don't keep our
[1:34:57] promises, we should be dead just like
[1:35:00] this this this animal is dead. Praise
[1:35:04] the Lord. Do you see that level of
[1:35:08] commitment, that level of
[1:35:12] dedication? Praise the
[1:35:14] Lord. Amen.
[1:35:19] We we can't you can't leave from that
[1:35:21] spot and and and and just come up with a
[1:35:23] different complete where I was just
[1:35:25] there. I just said that because I I just
[1:35:27] wanted to say
[1:35:29] it. It does not work that
[1:35:32] way. Praise the
[1:35:36] Lord. It does not work that way. that
[1:35:40] that very that very uh h principle that
[1:35:44] very principle that God engaged himself
[1:35:48] in when he decided to h create a
[1:35:52] universe and decided to to to to make
[1:35:55] man to dwell on the earth. God held
[1:35:59] himself responsible. He held himself to
[1:36:02] a
[1:36:03] commitment to a
[1:36:06] coveting. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:09] Are we
[1:36:13] together? So when he call
[1:36:16] us, he call us also to that level of
[1:36:19] commitment. And everything that is done
[1:36:22] under the Christian faith is also done
[1:36:24] to that level of
[1:36:26] commitment. Just like I said
[1:36:31] earlier, when we when we when we make a
[1:36:34] choice and we give our heart to the Lord
[1:36:38] and says uh uh uh uh you know I accept
[1:36:41] the Lord Jesus as my Lord and
[1:36:45] Savior. Praise the Lord. God is
[1:36:48] committed to
[1:36:49] that. Are we committed to
[1:36:53] it? Praise the Lord. Are we committed to
[1:36:56] it? Do we just take it like uh h I mean
[1:37:00] just it's it's just a club another club
[1:37:02] we are joining. It's just another
[1:37:04] society that we have joining. And
[1:37:06] sometimes we can take it in a very
[1:37:09] extreme level where it looks like we
[1:37:10] have joined a c.
[1:37:15] Praise the
[1:37:16] Lord. Amen.
[1:37:19] You see the danger of of joining a cut
[1:37:22] is they there you know you can stand for
[1:37:24] all the radical ideas when you are in
[1:37:27] the midst of your radical friends but
[1:37:29] sometimes when you are not there you
[1:37:30] really don't believe it
[1:37:33] you just got to stand for it because if
[1:37:36] you don't stand with them you might lose
[1:37:37] your life they might turn against
[1:37:42] you there is nothing that really bring
[1:37:46] half conviction
[1:37:48] than the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:53] That's the reason why every form of
[1:37:55] religion will give you rules that you
[1:37:57] have to observe. You can do this, you
[1:38:00] can do that, you can do this, you can do
[1:38:02] that because that's the only way they
[1:38:04] can keep you. It does not have a power
[1:38:07] to change your heart,
[1:38:10] to convict you, to change your heart and
[1:38:13] have you to conform to that as as
[1:38:16] something that you can die for.
[1:38:19] Praise the Lord. There was a case many
[1:38:22] many I mean some some time ago I I read
[1:38:25] that to you. There was a case one time
[1:38:27] in the United States and uh uh it had to
[1:38:31] do with the court, the Supreme Court and
[1:38:34] a Christian belief. And the Supreme
[1:38:36] Court of the United States came up with
[1:38:39] this verdict that when you say you have
[1:38:42] a is your
[1:38:44] conviction, it must be something you can
[1:38:47] die
[1:38:49] for, not something you just believe.
[1:38:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. If you say it's
[1:38:59] my conviction for me to dress like this
[1:39:02] or it's my conviction for me to, you
[1:39:05] know, raise my child like this, it has
[1:39:08] to be something that you have given your
[1:39:11] life over that I can die for this.
[1:39:16] If you can die for it, even the highest
[1:39:19] court in the land don't take you
[1:39:21] serious.
[1:39:27] Praise the Lord. So it it comes back to
[1:39:30] standing in the midst of a dead animal.
[1:39:32] If I if if if I don't keep my agreement,
[1:39:35] let me be as dead as this animal. That
[1:39:38] was just how serious men talk uh uh
[1:39:42] their covenant, their
[1:39:46] agreement. Praise the
[1:39:48] Lord. Amen. People don't see it like
[1:39:52] like that. Society has been able to def
[1:39:55] define what our marriage agreement is,
[1:39:59] what our family agreement is, how the
[1:40:03] church must must must must uh must be
[1:40:06] kept. We come up with different
[1:40:09] matter and God's
[1:40:12] principle is left
[1:40:17] out. One
[1:40:20] faith, one love, one
[1:40:25] baptism. Are we
[1:40:35] together? The church is losing her
[1:40:37] bounding
[1:40:39] power. Praise the Lord. So we have to
[1:40:42] come up with different different
[1:40:43] programs so we can keep people. We got
[1:40:46] to do things and and you know and and
[1:40:48] and just come up with different
[1:40:49] different form. Oh, let's let's do these
[1:40:51] things for the for the ladies. Let's do
[1:40:53] this other things for you know for for
[1:40:55] the men's society. Let's do this just
[1:40:57] coming up with different things because
[1:41:00] we we are losing what's supposed to keep
[1:41:04] us. What's supposed to keep us is the
[1:41:07] importance that each one of us put on
[1:41:10] the word of God. how we take God's word
[1:41:14] serious that God means what he says and
[1:41:18] he says what he means.
[1:41:25] Praise the Lord. Until we until by the
[1:41:29] grace of God we have grown to
[1:41:33] death, we will not have enough to keep
[1:41:36] us in the days of trials.
[1:41:40] We will not have enough to keep us when
[1:41:42] everything is against us.
[1:41:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:48] That's the reason why people can, you
[1:41:50] know, they can just they can throw their
[1:41:52] entire life through the window. Throw
[1:41:55] their the life of their children and and
[1:41:57] family through the window because they
[1:41:59] don't take vows
[1:42:06] serious. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:12] That's what the Hebrews call the
[1:42:14] iikida. That
[1:42:20] bounding. Glory be to
[1:42:22] God. Amen. Think about it this way. God
[1:42:27] came to Abraham and tell Abraham, wake
[1:42:30] him up. What? It was a vision.
[1:42:34] Abraham, take thy thy son, thy own son,
[1:42:38] whom thy
[1:42:39] loveth. Amen. Watch this. Now, it's not
[1:42:43] a
[1:42:45] dialogue where God is telling Abraham,
[1:42:47] Abraham, okay, will you be able to give
[1:42:50] Isaac to me if I really want
[1:42:53] him? Praise the Lord.
[1:42:55] I I believe if if God will have said
[1:42:58] that Abraham will have said to him, but
[1:43:00] you say I will be a father of
[1:43:04] nations. You you told me I will be a
[1:43:07] father of nation through the child I
[1:43:09] will have with Sarah. Then now now you
[1:43:10] are telling me I should give him to
[1:43:13] you. Praise the
[1:43:17] Lord. Well, you know, yeah. Yeah, I said
[1:43:20] that. uh you you you can you trust
[1:43:25] me? Praise the Lord. Now, what what way
[1:43:28] I'm trying to bring you there is that uh
[1:43:31] if there if it was a dialogue between
[1:43:34] between uh uh uh God and Abraham on the
[1:43:39] matter, they would have come to some
[1:43:42] form of
[1:43:45] agreement. Abraham will have understand
[1:43:47] the contract. But it was there was not a
[1:43:51] dialogue. God says, "Take that son, thy
[1:43:54] only son you
[1:43:56] love, and offer him to
[1:43:59] me." Praise the Lord. No
[1:44:04] dialogue. Praise the Lord. So in this
[1:44:08] case, who is solely responsible?
[1:44:13] God is solely
[1:44:15] responsible because he does not have an
[1:44:17] agreement with Abraham how this thing is
[1:44:19] going to turn up. He's giving Abraham an
[1:44:22] instruction, a commandment. Take thy
[1:44:24] son, thy own
[1:44:29] son. Are we
[1:44:31] together?
[1:44:32] Amen. Now, oh, this is becoming
[1:44:36] wonderful. Now you will
[1:44:39] see when it gets to the place where
[1:44:42] Abraham is telling his father the altar
[1:44:45] is ready, everything is set. Where is
[1:44:48] the
[1:44:50] sacrifice? Abraham cannot tell Isaac
[1:44:54] that well God and myself decided that
[1:44:56] the sacrifice will come like this. No,
[1:44:58] he said God will provide
[1:45:03] himself. He did it by himself.
[1:45:07] He came to this decision by himself.
[1:45:13] Praise the Lord. Are we together? God
[1:45:17] will provide
[1:45:24] himself. Are we
[1:45:26] together? Why? Because he decided, he
[1:45:29] came up with this.
[1:45:32] Everything that Abraham knew about it,
[1:45:35] he just kept it in his heart. Things
[1:45:37] that were that were so heavy to
[1:45:42] alter in so much not even knowing how it
[1:45:46] would turn out. He told the two young
[1:45:48] men, "You're with for me here. Me and
[1:45:50] the lair we going up there to offer and
[1:45:52] we will come back." Amen. He never said,
[1:45:56] "I will come back." Those guys were
[1:45:59] asking, "But then what will happen to
[1:46:00] Isaac?
[1:46:02] He said, "Y'all wait for me here. We're
[1:46:04] going up there and we will come
[1:46:09] back." Are we together? Amen. Because
[1:46:13] said now he's dealing with a with a with
[1:46:17] h a god that have that have come up with
[1:46:20] this thing by himself. He had decided
[1:46:23] to, you know, h take the only evidence
[1:46:25] that he gave to
[1:46:29] Abraham. Of all of these years that
[1:46:32] Abraham has passed with his testimony, I
[1:46:34] will become the father of many nation.
[1:46:37] God that gave the promise is the one man
[1:46:40] that is telling Abraham to destroy the
[1:46:42] only
[1:46:48] evidence. Glory be to God.
[1:46:52] You see why we see less of God in our
[1:46:55] life is how much
[1:46:59] serious seriousness we put on his
[1:47:03] word. How much we take his promises to
[1:47:07] be
[1:47:07] serious. Amen. He say his word is y and
[1:47:13] amen. When he says it, he mean it.
[1:47:20] Praise the
[1:47:24] Lord. But you see we come up with so
[1:47:27] many
[1:47:28] reason so many reason why we think that
[1:47:33] the word does not really means what it
[1:47:35] says and all of those things weaken the
[1:47:39] effect of the word of God in our
[1:47:45] life. Are we together?
[1:47:49] Oh, praise the
[1:47:57] Lord. What a mighty God we serve. Amen.
[1:48:03] Agapo
[1:48:08] gave the scripture says
[1:48:12] here in plain now this uh uh uh uh
[1:48:17] Genesis say John 3:16 for God so loved
[1:48:21] the word that he
[1:48:24] gave.
[1:48:27] Amen. Praise the Lord. His love
[1:48:31] gave. And when his love gave, he never
[1:48:35] gave anything
[1:48:39] lesser. Praise the Lord. He gave
[1:48:47] himself. Glory be to
[1:48:50] God. He gave himself.
[1:48:54] That is the reason why uh
[1:48:59] uh the the trinity teaching has been a
[1:49:03] very uh uh troubling
[1:49:06] teaching all through the church
[1:49:10] ages. Great men and they have they have
[1:49:13] got right in there to be able to steady
[1:49:16] the the you know uh everything around
[1:49:18] around
[1:49:21] trinity. Praise the Lord. Why? Because
[1:49:25] it's represented in
[1:49:29] nature. We are
[1:49:31] trinity body, spirit and
[1:49:35] soul. Praise the Lord. The trinity
[1:49:39] teaching is is wrong when it's applied
[1:49:43] to
[1:49:46] God because he's just
[1:49:49] one. He's not three person in one. is
[1:49:52] just
[1:49:54] one. The trinity teaching apply more
[1:49:58] when that one god in his
[1:50:01] dealing with
[1:50:06] us. Are we together?
[1:50:13] Like John will says there the uh uh uh
[1:50:16] uh in uh in his
[1:50:18] episode, there are three that bear
[1:50:21] record.
[1:50:24] Amen. The water, the blood, and the
[1:50:27] spirit that have to do with
[1:50:32] us. It don't have to do with
[1:50:38] God. Are we together?
[1:50:42] So, but the whole thing has been twisted
[1:50:45] around where we have make a three person
[1:50:48] in
[1:50:49] heaven. We have make a a a father, a son
[1:50:53] and and the holy ghost that have to make
[1:50:54] some kind of a
[1:50:56] decision. Praise the Lord.
[1:51:00] When God was manifesting himself in a
[1:51:03] way that he was dealing with
[1:51:05] man, he he he show himself to the
[1:51:08] fathers through vision and different
[1:51:11] thing in a fatherhood. The way he dealt
[1:51:13] with them. Are we together? He gave us a
[1:51:18] body that he came and
[1:51:21] dwar that was born like we all were
[1:51:25] born. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:51:29] And he dwed in that body to be able to
[1:51:32] redeem us. He took a sunship to be able
[1:51:35] to identify himself with us.
[1:51:39] And now he broke out his great internal
[1:51:43] spirit and gave each and every one of us
[1:51:46] a portion of it.
[1:51:50] Praise the Lord. Is it the same one God?
[1:51:56] Are we together?
[1:51:59] But you see the the the the the the
[1:52:02] confusion of the teaching. I believe the
[1:52:04] devil right on this
[1:52:07] teaching to put the church into
[1:52:10] confusion. Why? Because because of
[1:52:14] that the
[1:52:16] church lost its bounding
[1:52:21] power. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:40] I read this to you in a deity of Jesus
[1:52:42] Christ. Now
[1:52:44] look, I want you to notice
[1:52:47] something. Then when this the only way
[1:52:51] that God himself could ever redeem this
[1:52:55] man was to come down and take his
[1:52:59] place, God
[1:53:01] himself.
[1:53:04] Amen. We are looking at what what
[1:53:07] Abraham say out of prophecy. God will
[1:53:10] provide
[1:53:15] himself. He will provide
[1:53:18] himself. God will come down himself in
[1:53:22] your
[1:53:23] situation. Praise the Lord. Amen. God
[1:53:28] will come down himself when it comes to
[1:53:30] your healing. God will come down
[1:53:35] himself because he's the Lord that
[1:53:37] healeth our
[1:53:44] diseases. That's how
[1:53:47] much he want to be
[1:53:49] involved. That's how much he is
[1:53:53] involved in our
[1:53:57] lives. Praise the Lord.
[1:54:01] not just giving us a second part of
[1:54:02] himself or the third part of himself,
[1:54:05] but he's giving us his
[1:54:11] fullness. Are we
[1:54:16] together? He swore by himself and God
[1:54:20] himself coming out of the spirit went
[1:54:24] into Christ. And the Bible said that God
[1:54:28] was in Christ reconciling the word to
[1:54:31] himself. Is that right? God himself,
[1:54:35] Jehovah, live in Christ and was made a
[1:54:39] kinsman to
[1:54:41] us because he was born in him of flesh
[1:54:47] like we
[1:54:48] are. Praise the
[1:54:50] Lord. Amen.
[1:54:53] where where the the the the the church
[1:54:55] world struggle is we reduce God. If if
[1:54:59] if if we if we can leave him as a as the
[1:55:03] the father, the great one there, you
[1:55:06] know, and and and and you know, and this
[1:55:08] is the son, the lesser one that died on
[1:55:09] the cross and and and and we have the
[1:55:12] Holy Ghost, you know, the one that we
[1:55:13] can, but the father, the the thought
[1:55:15] there is that if we just make God to be
[1:55:19] the one that was born in the manger and
[1:55:22] the one that died on the cross, like the
[1:55:24] Muslim would say, "Oh, you're God down.
[1:55:26] If Jesus was God, then God died on the
[1:55:28] cross." Praise the Lord. So it it looks
[1:55:31] terrible in the mind of the Christian
[1:55:34] because the mystery that is tied around
[1:55:37] it. It looks terrible that we are
[1:55:39] reducing
[1:55:41] God to say that God is in you and God is
[1:55:46] in me and God is in
[1:55:49] us. And
[1:55:51] yet we have our human struggle.
[1:55:56] Are are we not reducing
[1:55:58] God? But it's the mystery of the
[1:56:01] greatness of God.
[1:56:04] Praise the Lord. The mystery of his
[1:56:07] greatness. Like Paul says, without
[1:56:10] controversy, great is the mystery of
[1:56:14] godliness. Amen.
[1:56:17] the mystery of his godliness that you
[1:56:19] know in his godliness and in his
[1:56:22] holiness and in his greatness he can
[1:56:25] still reduce himself or humble himself
[1:56:28] and come to our
[1:56:30] level. Praise the
[1:56:34] Lord. That is the mystery of his
[1:56:36] greatness.
[1:56:43] But where the trouble
[1:56:46] is, the trouble is our part of the
[1:56:50] agreement. God take his word serious. He
[1:56:53] take his promises serious. But do we do
[1:56:56] the
[1:56:56] same? Praise the Lord. Amen. Do we do
[1:57:01] the same? Do we take him at his
[1:57:06] word? Glory be to
[1:57:09] God. Amen.
[1:57:11] Are we are we seeing God providing
[1:57:14] himself in our
[1:57:19] situation? No matter what what we are
[1:57:22] dealing
[1:57:23] with, can we able to be able to see
[1:57:28] God providing himself? Can we able to
[1:57:31] see God stepping into our
[1:57:37] situation? Oh yeah, we believe that God
[1:57:39] can do it. We believe that I mean there
[1:57:42] is nothing impossible with God but a
[1:57:44] little sense of fear is there. I don't
[1:57:47] know when. I don't know
[1:57:50] how. Praise the Lord. Amen. So that
[1:57:54] little sense of fear of I don't know
[1:57:56] when. I don't know
[1:57:59] how reduce our
[1:58:05] commitment. Oh yeah. We believe the word
[1:58:07] of God. We believe that God word is
[1:58:08] true. We believe that God is powerful.
[1:58:10] He's a miracle working God. He healed
[1:58:12] this person. He's going to heal us. But
[1:58:15] that little question in the back of our
[1:58:19] mind
[1:58:20] when how is it going to
[1:58:25] happen? Praise the Lord. When when we
[1:58:28] start playing in that realm of when and
[1:58:32] how, then it affect our commitment.
[1:58:35] We we are no longer bounding ourself
[1:58:39] again to that
[1:58:42] promise. Then we start slacking. We
[1:58:44] start finding other alternative. We
[1:58:47] start making
[1:58:49] excuses. Praise the Lord. We start
[1:58:52] making excuses. We start fighting
[1:58:54] against the very principle that we say
[1:58:57] we believe.
[1:59:06] Are we
[1:59:07] together?
[1:59:09] Amen. You will realize that the man on
[1:59:12] the road of Emas when brother Abraham
[1:59:15] talks about that he talks about uh uh
[1:59:19] the the rapture when Jesus says no man
[1:59:22] know the date and the hour. He let us
[1:59:25] know that the two things that is hid in
[1:59:27] there
[1:59:28] is the how and the
[1:59:34] when the mystery of the coming of the
[1:59:38] Lord. That's the two things that God
[1:59:41] kept to himself. If not he gave us lot
[1:59:45] of symbols in the Bible how he will
[1:59:48] come. Amen. There are a lot of types in
[1:59:52] the
[1:59:53] scripture that reveal how he's going to
[1:59:59] come. Are we
[2:00:03] together? You see, so as we as we look
[2:00:06] at this this morning and um I I need a
[2:00:09] closeup here since we have to come back
[2:00:11] this evening uh uh for our prayer
[2:00:15] meeting and communion service.
[2:00:18] That's that's that's that's what I want
[2:00:20] to drive to because the the the the the
[2:00:23] whole thing that captured my mind on
[2:00:26] this
[2:00:36] subject and not only with the church.
[2:00:39] It's
[2:00:40] affecting
[2:00:42] every every part of our lives.
[2:00:50] Amen. Our
[2:00:53] commitment to our vow, our commitment to
[2:00:58] our
[2:01:03] promises, our commitment to our
[2:01:06] promises.
[2:01:14] Glory be to
[2:01:18] God. We take the Lord's name in in in
[2:01:22] baptism. You know, we made that promise
[2:01:25] to him. We serve him all the days of our
[2:01:30] lives. It's a everyday
[2:01:34] commitment. It's wherever we
[2:01:37] are. It's in whatever we are
[2:01:41] doing. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:44] Amen. It's not only a commitment that we
[2:01:47] made when we when we wear our best to
[2:01:49] come to church on
[2:01:51] Sunday. It's a commitment, a everyday
[2:01:56] commitment every aspect of our life in
[2:01:58] everything that we are
[2:02:01] doing. Praise the Lord. You will see
[2:02:04] that is the reason why men of
[2:02:07] all you know men of all the that they
[2:02:12] spend their
[2:02:14] lives they spend their lives for for the
[2:02:17] kingdom of God. They spend their life
[2:02:20] they spend everything they have for for
[2:02:23] this calling that they
[2:02:26] had. Glory be to
[2:02:29] God. our age. Since it's a harvest age,
[2:02:33] it looks like we are gathering
[2:02:34] everything. We don't want to spend
[2:02:38] it. We we want to just take and gather
[2:02:41] and
[2:02:46] gather. We are in harvest age. So, you
[2:02:49] know, harvest time is gathering
[2:02:55] time. But that's that is the thing that
[2:02:57] was in my mind. That's that is the thing
[2:02:59] that uh I was I was laboring on when I
[2:03:02] was thinking about
[2:03:04] this. Praise the Lord.
[2:03:08] Amen. The church is failing today
[2:03:11] because she's very weak on her
[2:03:15] commitment. Praise the Lord. God is
[2:03:18] willing and
[2:03:20] determined and he goes
[2:03:23] beyond because it is his word that is at
[2:03:26] stake.
[2:03:28] is his promise that is at
[2:03:30] stake. Praise the Lord. If he can find a
[2:03:34] man or find a woman that can take his
[2:03:37] word
[2:03:38] serious that he means what he says and
[2:03:42] he says what he
[2:03:45] means that no matter what the situation
[2:03:48] is, God will provide
[2:03:51] himself. And I'm not going to take
[2:03:53] nothing less than himself.
[2:03:57] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:59] Amen. But the church will settle for any
[2:04:02] little thing. Anything that you can you
[2:04:05] you know you can bring and and y'all can
[2:04:08] just agree on they will settle for it.
[2:04:10] But those things will not
[2:04:12] last. We have settled for doctrines. We
[2:04:15] have settled for teachings. We are stay
[2:04:17] here. We realize that those things never
[2:04:19] kept
[2:04:22] us. As good as the
[2:04:26] word, only thing that keep is
[2:04:31] him. Praise the
[2:04:33] Lord. Is him.
[2:04:45] That's the reason why he didn't give us
[2:04:47] nothing less than
[2:04:49] himself.
[2:04:52] Amen. We are feeding on the body
[2:04:59] word of the son of God, the son of
[2:05:03] man. Praise the Lord. Jesus symbolically
[2:05:08] he says take this bread, eat this is my
[2:05:10] body. Take this uh uh wine, drink it
[2:05:13] represent my blood.
[2:05:18] I'm making a covenant with
[2:05:24] you. You see how how how much he wanted
[2:05:28] to be so much bound with his
[2:05:32] people. Praise the
[2:05:43] Lord. God
[2:05:45] will provide
[2:05:50] himself. Glory be to God. In as much as
[2:05:53] God has given us
[2:05:56] gifts, when he ascended on high, he gave
[2:06:01] gifts. He has given us a five-fold
[2:06:03] ministry. He has given us nine spiritual
[2:06:06] gifts. They all in the scripture is all
[2:06:09] there for us for our
[2:06:11] benefit. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:14] But the guest will never take the place
[2:06:16] of the
[2:06:20] giver.
[2:06:22] Amen. He don't want you to just stick
[2:06:25] with the
[2:06:26] gift. He want you to get the giver.
[2:06:29] Amen. He don't want you to just fall in
[2:06:32] love with the wrap that is on the gift.
[2:06:35] He want you to open it. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:39] Open the
[2:06:40] wrap. Get beyond the wrap.
[2:06:43] The preacher is just a rap. Amen. The
[2:06:47] singer is just a rap. The people that
[2:06:50] that God put in our life to be blessing
[2:06:53] to us, they they are just wrapping his
[2:06:55] present. He want you to get beyond
[2:07:03] that. Are we together?
[2:07:08] We get we get so
[2:07:10] satisfied and uh and then we slack in
[2:07:14] those
[2:07:15] things.
[2:07:16] God will provide
[2:07:20] himself.
[2:07:22] Amen. He's reminding us he will keep his
[2:07:25] word here. I mean what whatever he have
[2:07:27] said he going to do it.
[2:07:38] And that's the place I want to bring us
[2:07:40] this morning as a
[2:07:43] church, as a church, as a
[2:07:47] family. Praise the Lord. Even in our
[2:07:51] household, even in our house as a
[2:07:54] family, if we don't come to the
[2:07:57] consciousness that this is our home and
[2:08:01] we don't hold ourself responsible for
[2:08:03] the best of this
[2:08:05] home. Amen. We are responsible to feed
[2:08:08] this home. We are responsible to make
[2:08:10] sure that is clean. We are responsible.
[2:08:12] We get in the in the place of
[2:08:14] distributing work and then you never did
[2:08:16] this. We are part of this house.
[2:08:21] Praise the
[2:08:24] Lord. If we don't hold ourself
[2:08:27] responsible, that house is going to
[2:08:30] fail. Praise the Lord. Our selfish
[2:08:35] attitude is going to make the house fail
[2:08:38] because we have already playing in our
[2:08:40] mind who to
[2:08:42] blame. We are never responsible for what
[2:08:44] is happening.
[2:08:52] The lack of
[2:08:54] commitment, the lack of commitment,
[2:08:57] that's what is destroying our
[2:09:00] society, is destroying our
[2:09:03] homes. Amen. The lack of commitment to
[2:09:07] our children is destroying
[2:09:11] them. Praise the Lord.
[2:09:28] We have to realize that we must hold
[2:09:30] ourself responsible. We are in this
[2:09:33] thing to to
[2:09:35] fight. Praise the Lord. If you want a
[2:09:38] good health, you got to fight for it.
[2:09:41] You must hold yourself responsible.
[2:09:46] Oh, this is the doctor that ordered the
[2:09:48] medication. Okay. Yeah. He told you how
[2:09:50] to take it. It's not going in his body.
[2:09:52] It's going in your body. You have to
[2:09:54] observe yourself. See how it's treating
[2:09:56] your body.
[2:09:59] Amen. If you are not feeling good about
[2:10:01] it, stop taking it. Go back to the
[2:10:03] doctor. Look, I'm taking this thing.
[2:10:05] It's swinking my eyes.
[2:10:12] Oh, it's the doctor that say I should
[2:10:14] take it. It's the doctor that say I
[2:10:15] should take it and I will be dead and
[2:10:18] the doctor will still be living. He will
[2:10:20] go on with his
[2:10:29] job. A lack of
[2:10:34] accountability. We are living in the
[2:10:36] blaming society.
[2:10:40] Everybody is responsible for it, not
[2:10:45] me. Praise the
[2:10:48] Lord. But you see, God is making us to
[2:10:52] see that he's responsible for this
[2:10:55] universe. He's telling you that if you
[2:10:58] look at what is happening around you
[2:11:00] now, if you look at what is happening,
[2:11:02] if you look into his word, you will
[2:11:04] realize that he's responsible for it.
[2:11:08] because his word said
[2:11:13] it. He raises power. He puts power down.
[2:11:17] He raises government. He puts government
[2:11:20] down.
[2:11:26] He want us to hold him
[2:11:30] responsible, not Donald Trump, Democrat
[2:11:32] and Republican, because we feed into
[2:11:35] those
[2:11:38] things and then it takes us from the
[2:11:41] reality of what is happening because
[2:11:43] we're not looking into the word of God.
[2:11:45] We're not taking the word serious, the
[2:11:48] promise of our day, the things that he
[2:11:50] said will happen.
[2:11:52] The same way he spoke about war powers,
[2:11:55] political powers, the economy, the same
[2:11:59] way he spoke about all of that, he also
[2:12:01] spoke about his sons and his daughters.
[2:12:05] Praise the Lord. Amen. He spoke about
[2:12:08] his sons and his daughters, how his
[2:12:11] church will be in the last day. What
[2:12:13] will happen to the people? Daniel said
[2:12:16] they did uh h fear the Lord.
[2:12:24] Amen. We do
[2:12:27] exploit. He said
[2:12:29] it that if we take his word serious and
[2:12:33] we cling to the field of the Lord, he
[2:12:35] will do X plus in our life. If the
[2:12:38] economy is not going for everybody, it
[2:12:41] would not be for us.
[2:12:47] He said, "I am the Lord that health all
[2:12:49] your diseases."
[2:12:54] Praise the Lord. If we take him serious
[2:12:56] at his word and we come under the
[2:12:59] shelter of his
[2:13:05] wings, are you are you are you are you
[2:13:07] there with me this morning or I'm just
[2:13:10] in my own space?
[2:13:13] Oh, I'm just blocked in my
[2:13:16] mind. The same thing with our family.
[2:13:19] The same thing with our home. The same
[2:13:21] thing with the church of the living
[2:13:24] God. If if it just become a place where
[2:13:27] we come to pass time on on Sunday
[2:13:32] morning, then you wasting your own
[2:13:35] time. You wasting your own time.
[2:13:39] You better look into this thing and take
[2:13:41] it serious. What am I doing here? What
[2:13:44] do I come here for? What is what this is
[2:13:46] all
[2:13:52] about? Because God is committed to his
[2:13:55] word. He's committed to his promises.
[2:14:00] We are the one that are slacking. We are
[2:14:03] the one that are making excuses.
[2:14:06] We are the one that are destroying the
[2:14:08] very thing that God has placed in our
[2:14:12] hands. He trusts us with children. He
[2:14:14] trusts us with a with a
[2:14:16] spouse. Whether male or
[2:14:19] female, our irresponsible attitude is
[2:14:24] destroying
[2:14:28] that. We are the one destroying it.
[2:14:40] Are we
[2:14:47] together? The word teaches us everything
[2:14:50] that we should go through. They first
[2:14:53] tell us
[2:14:55] repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:14:57] the Lord Jesus
[2:14:59] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[2:15:02] the Holy Ghost.
[2:15:05] That's what the word
[2:15:07] says. Do we take that
[2:15:10] serious or we go into all the argument
[2:15:13] of which baptism is right? Is it front?
[2:15:16] Is it back
[2:15:19] f? Which one is right? We go into all of
[2:15:22] those kind of argument and before we we
[2:15:25] realize the importance is
[2:15:29] lost. We are just caught up in
[2:15:34] theory. We do it to to to praise
[2:15:37] ourself. It looks like a ceremony.
[2:15:40] Everybody come and see me getting
[2:15:42] baptized. It's all about
[2:15:45] us. The real thing is not there.
[2:15:50] Praise the
[2:15:51] Lord. Amen. The real thing is not
[2:15:57] there. We have made this whole life
[2:15:59] about
[2:16:01] us. When he said in his word that he
[2:16:04] made up for his
[2:16:06] purpose. We are not seeking his
[2:16:12] purpose. We are just looking for our
[2:16:14] pleasing. What please
[2:16:16] us. And when it don't please us, it's
[2:16:19] not right, it's not good, and we
[2:16:20] complain, we fuss about it. But what is
[2:16:23] his purpose? Why if he put you there for
[2:16:25] for that
[2:16:36] purpose? Are we
[2:16:41] together? That's what Easter is all
[2:16:44] about. God provide
[2:16:49] himself. Praise the Lord.
[2:16:54] Amen. God provide
[2:17:00] himself. And until we get
[2:17:03] himself, until we get him, let's not
[2:17:07] settle for church
[2:17:10] membership. Let's not
[2:17:13] settle for the music and everything that
[2:17:15] God give. They're all
[2:17:17] wonderful, but let's look for that one
[2:17:20] that has gi
[2:17:24] himself. The musicians can
[2:17:37] come. It's all about commitment,
[2:17:40] people. It's all about
[2:17:43] commitment. Praise the Lord.
[2:17:47] when you made that commitment to take on
[2:17:49] his name and get identified with
[2:17:52] him. He's right there to stand with you.
[2:17:57] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:59] He's right there to keep his
[2:18:01] word. He's right there to follow
[2:18:05] through. But it looks like every time
[2:18:07] he's coming closer, we are taking one
[2:18:09] step
[2:18:10] backward. Amen.
[2:18:15] It's all about
[2:18:18] commitment that the Almighty God, think
[2:18:20] about it now, that the Almighty God will
[2:18:23] take fallen men, will take sinners and
[2:18:27] he will bring us into a coveting. A holy
[2:18:31] God will take us born in sin ship in
[2:18:35] iniquity and bring us to a coveting.
[2:18:40] How much more when we take
[2:18:44] ourself into
[2:18:46] coveting, how much more considerate we
[2:18:49] need to be, how much how much patience
[2:18:52] we need to have with one another. How
[2:18:54] much we have to be willing to help one
[2:18:57] another to become better. We can make
[2:19:00] God better. He's so patient with us
[2:19:03] because he knows what we are made out
[2:19:05] of. He want to help us to become better.
[2:19:09] Then why can't we think about it? Why
[2:19:11] should I think that my pastor is a
[2:19:13] perfect man? Why should I think that oh
[2:19:15] the brother there supposed to know
[2:19:19] better? Why should I think that oh I
[2:19:22] mean my wife supposed to know better.
[2:19:24] She's a per No. Why? Why should we look
[2:19:26] for the
[2:19:28] perfection in one another?
[2:19:31] [Music]
[2:19:39] Now, when you begin to look at things
[2:19:40] like
[2:19:43] that, you realize that I need to step up
[2:19:46] in my
[2:19:50] commitment. If I'm going to make the
[2:19:52] family life better, I need to step up in
[2:19:54] my commitment. If I'm going to make the
[2:19:56] life of my children better, I need to
[2:19:58] step up in my commitment.
[2:20:01] If I if I'm going to make the church to
[2:20:04] be a better
[2:20:07] place for me and my family, I need to
[2:20:09] step up in my
[2:20:14] commitment. I have to know what what
[2:20:16] this is all about.
[2:20:21] [Music]
[2:20:29] They that
[2:20:31] wait upon the
[2:20:34] Lord shall
[2:20:39] renew their strength.
[2:20:43] We shall mount
[2:20:46] up with
[2:20:49] weight as a
[2:20:53] go.
[2:20:56] Oh, they shall
[2:20:59] run and I be
[2:21:02] where they
[2:21:05] shall. Oh, and I
[2:21:09] fear. Yes. Teach me Lord. Oh, teach me
[2:21:16] Lord
[2:21:21] to. Oh
[2:21:23] yeah. They that
[2:21:26] wait upon the
[2:21:30] Lord shall renew.
[2:21:35] All their strength they shall bow
[2:21:41] up with
[2:21:44] wings as they
[2:21:49] go. Oh yeah, they shall
[2:21:54] run and be weary. Yeah, they shall go.
[2:22:01] Oh, and
[2:22:04] I So, teach me
[2:22:07] Lord, teach me
[2:22:11] Lord to me. Let's sing that one more
[2:22:14] time
[2:22:16] now. Oh yeah. Be thy
[2:22:21] wait upon the
[2:22:24] world shall
[2:22:28] renew. Yes. Straight Lord, they shall
[2:22:35] mountain with
[2:22:38] peace as an
[2:22:42] eagle. Oh Lord, they shall
[2:22:49] run.
[2:22:54] together and
[2:22:58] never teach me Lord. Oh, please teach me
[2:23:04] all to win. You think about this this
[2:23:09] morning before we pray. The kind of an
[2:23:12] attitude where we have and little things
[2:23:14] come up, we really to quit. No, I'm I'm
[2:23:17] tired. I'm I'm quing. What if God was
[2:23:20] taking that attitude to
[2:23:24] us? Quitting is not even in his
[2:23:28] mind. Why? Because he committed himself
[2:23:32] even before he brought us on the
[2:23:35] earth. Oh, I'm just tired with these
[2:23:38] people on the earth. I'm I'm tired with
[2:23:40] all the the, you know, the abuse, the
[2:23:43] drugs, and everything. I'm just going to
[2:23:45] quit. I'm going to fold everything.
[2:23:52] It's not part of
[2:23:54] [Music]
[2:23:59] him. You see, when when you when you get
[2:24:02] into a
[2:24:04] commitment and you don't you don't you
[2:24:07] don't have quitting as an
[2:24:10] option. If you don't have quitting as an
[2:24:13] as an option, you are motivated every
[2:24:15] day to fight. No matter how things be
[2:24:19] combined, you you are able to dash
[2:24:21] yourself in it because quitting is not
[2:24:23] an option for you. You ready to fight to
[2:24:27] your last
[2:24:29] birth? I rather die
[2:24:32] trying than
[2:24:36] quitting. Praise the Lord.
[2:24:40] People that quit, they have bunch of
[2:24:43] excuse. They feed on those excuses.
[2:24:50] That is the problem with our
[2:24:54] society. Our skill of
[2:24:57] commitment is very
[2:24:59] [Music]
[2:25:02] weak. We will promise to do this before
[2:25:05] we realize you back off. You make an
[2:25:08] excuse and leave it.
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:39] We make excuses that, oh yeah, I'm, you
[2:25:41] know, I'm a human. Yeah, we are humans.
[2:25:44] [Music]
[2:25:46] We will always fail. We will always make
[2:25:51] mistakes. But let's hold oursel to high
[2:25:54] standard as sons and daughters of
[2:25:58] God. Let's hold oursel to the place
[2:26:02] where we realize that it's our calling.
[2:26:11] Whichever way, whatever it has to take
[2:26:14] for us to make it
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:32] right. They walk years, they'll never
[2:26:36] fail.
[2:26:38] So teach me
[2:26:41] Lord, teach me
[2:26:47] Lord. Let's pray together by the music
[2:26:50] softly playing. Heavenly
[2:26:53] Father, Lord
[2:26:58] Jesus, I just had this thought on my
[2:27:01] heart during the entire week, Lord.
[2:27:06] How the church is losing its bounding
[2:27:08] power. The thing that's supposed to keep
[2:27:11] us
[2:27:12] together. It's not the
[2:27:15] numbers. It's the importance we put on
[2:27:18] your word. It's how much we take your
[2:27:20] word
[2:27:21] [Music]
[2:27:23] serious. It's how much we are willing to
[2:27:26] commit ourself to your word and not to
[2:27:29] make excuses.
[2:27:32] The position of the believer is to
[2:27:34] repent, not make
[2:27:36] [Music]
[2:27:38] excuses. We must be repenting and
[2:27:41] saying, "Lord, forgive me. Lord, help
[2:27:43] me. Forgive me. And I'm failing on your
[2:27:45] word, not making
[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:51] excuses. We have become so weak in our
[2:27:55] praying commitment. We have become so
[2:27:59] weak. How are we going to take the word
[2:28:02] serious if we are not in the
[2:28:08] word? And that is beginning to affect
[2:28:11] things around us.
[2:28:15] [Music]
[2:28:26] [Music]
[2:28:30] But when God made his
[2:28:33] promise, he didn't promise to give us
[2:28:36] anything less than
[2:28:42] himself. He did not promise to give us
[2:28:44] anything less than
[2:28:47] himself. Heavenly Father is our need,
[2:28:51] Lord.
[2:28:53] Father, we have believed for many years
[2:28:56] you have us on the corner of the street
[2:28:58] for the
[2:29:00] purpose. Father, Lord
[2:29:05] God, we are still yet to rise up to that
[2:29:08] purpose. Lord, we are still here. Oh
[2:29:11] God, just like you didn't tell Abraham
[2:29:13] everything, you just told him your only
[2:29:17] son and father. And so we want to commit
[2:29:20] ourself. Abraham committed himself to
[2:29:23] that
[2:29:26] calling. The Bible say he woke up early
[2:29:29] in the morning and he set up on the
[2:29:32] [Music]
[2:29:38] joining. Father, help us in our
[2:29:41] commitment. Our commitment to our very
[2:29:46] self. our commitment to the ones you
[2:29:49] have put around
[2:29:54] [Music]
[2:30:00] us.
[2:30:02] [Music]
[2:30:05] Father, we just pray that Lord God, you
[2:30:07] will stir our hearts. Oh
[2:30:10] Lord, help us Lord Jesus.
[2:30:17] Father, there are souls, there are
[2:30:19] people, Lord, that are that are longing,
[2:30:22] Lord.
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:27] God, the church world has make just a
[2:30:29] poor example.
[2:30:36] [Music]
[2:30:39] Christian is just look looking like
[2:30:41] another bad word that is used in the
[2:30:44] society. But father Lord you said the
[2:30:48] creation waited for the manifestation of
[2:30:50] the sons of God.
[2:30:53] We want to commit ourself to that Lord
[2:30:55] and say,
[2:30:59] "Father, take us out of our laziness, oh
[2:31:02] God. Take us out of our walliness, Lord.
[2:31:06] [Music]
[2:31:11] Father, let's realize, oh God, Father,
[2:31:14] that when we take on your
[2:31:16] name, the Bible says, "Let them that
[2:31:18] name the name of Christ
[2:31:22] depart from evil, depart from iniquity,
[2:31:25] depart from sin.
[2:31:29] [Music]
[2:31:35] And father this afternoon we just pray
[2:31:39] for
[2:31:40] our local assembly Lord
[2:31:44] God as we trust Lord and pray that God
[2:31:47] you will raise
[2:31:49] up men and women Lord Father that would
[2:31:53] take your word
[2:31:54] serious now God knowing that Father when
[2:31:57] we come here Lord there is one thing oh
[2:32:00] All father that have the preeeminence
[2:32:02] Lord is you and your
[2:32:06] word. We love the brothers. We love the
[2:32:08] sisters. Oh God, we don't come to
[2:32:11] celebrate a man. We come to celebrate
[2:32:15] [Music]
[2:32:23] you, Father. And even in our family
[2:32:26] lives.
[2:32:33] Help us Lord
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:36] Jesus. Our commitment to the children,
[2:32:38] our commitment to our
[2:32:41] spouses, our commitment to our our vow,
[2:32:44] our
[2:32:49] [Music]
[2:32:50] promises as we would trust you, Father,
[2:32:52] for the service this evening. We pray
[2:32:55] that Lord God your grace will be with
[2:32:56] each and every one of us now in Jesus
[2:32:59] name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's uh stand
[2:33:03] up. We sing that
[2:33:05] song at Calvary. Yes. I spent validating
[2:33:15] pride in

[2:33:28] crucified. No way
[2:33:32] was me to die and
