[42:45] cold winter winter night Lord
[42:47] [Music]

[43:41] rest of the service
[43:46] praise God
[43:47] God bless you musicians
[43:49] that'll be all for tonight for now and
[43:53] while we are so standing
[43:55] can we take our Bibles
[43:57] and open
[43:59] to Exodus 11
[44:03] Exodus 11.
[44:15] Exodus 11 4.
[44:32] and Moses said
[44:35] thus says the Lord about midnight
[44:39] will I go out into the midst of Egypt
[44:44] praise be to God
[44:47] Exodus
[44:48] 12 29.
[45:05] and it came to pass
[45:08] that at midnight
[45:11] the Lord smote the first born
[45:15] in the land of Egypt from the firstborn
[45:18] of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto
[45:22] the firstborn of the captive that was in
[45:25] the dungeon and all the first born of
[45:29] cuddle
[45:31] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[45:33] reading of his word praise be to God
[45:36] shall we be seated
[45:40] good to see around of you tonight
[45:43] God bless you for coming
[45:52] yes
[45:55] we had such a wonderful time
[45:58] on Sunday
[46:01] the Holy Ghost came down in a very
[46:03] special way
[46:06] and um
[46:08] I remember sitting in the foyer
[46:12] and I was asking myself
[46:15] I said the way the Holy Ghost is moving
[46:20] I said what am I going to preach on
[46:22] Wednesday
[46:24] it was like even though I had something
[46:27] on mine
[46:28] it was like it just disappeared
[46:32] and I remember
[46:35] a couple of probably a couple of months
[46:38] ago
[46:39] um Joshua came out
[46:42] to to sing a special
[46:46] and um I remember he put in his his
[46:49] request and before then gospel had put
[46:53] in a request
[46:55] so Joshua was called To Come and sing he
[46:59] came out and he sang it was a very
[47:02] wonderful time
[47:04] for the first time I saw people dancing
[47:07] in the aisle that was not the first time
[47:09] but I saw some people for the first time
[47:12] dancing in the aisle it was just a
[47:15] wonderful time and I was out there and I
[47:19] was praying that the song leader should
[47:21] not call gospel
[47:23] not knowing gas cloth was sitting here
[47:26] praying that they shouldn't call him
[47:31] but the reasons were too different
[47:34] the atmosphere was so ripe
[47:38] and I was just praying that they
[47:40] shouldn't call gaspio
[47:41] so brother one would that passed out
[47:43] brother one would just walk in
[47:46] no no he was also sitting here praying
[47:48] that they shouldn't call him
[47:50] because
[47:52] the bar was so set very high
[47:55] and that if he came out nobody was going
[47:57] to listen to him
[48:00] I didn't know he didn't neither did he
[48:02] know
[48:04] so when Joshua went back and sat down
[48:07] into his ears Joshua
[48:09] you have embarrassed me greatly
[48:15] and Joshua said what
[48:19] so after service Joshua said that here
[48:22] Emmanuel said I said how would you say
[48:25] that to your brother
[48:26] he said that the way he sang nobody was
[48:28] going to listen to me
[48:31] so I was praying now she didn't be
[48:33] called and if they had called me I would
[48:35] not even saying
[48:38] oh praise be to God
[48:41] yeah it was just a good thing I didn't
[48:42] come right after after Sunday's service
[48:45] because I wouldn't have known what to
[48:46] preach praise God but there's been some
[48:49] days now
[48:50] um we are just trusting God for his
[48:52] Divine leadership
[48:55] somewhere last month
[48:58] during Sunday School
[49:03] um
[49:03] I was also having so so busy this week
[49:06] it's like I have not had time for myself
[49:09] I I thought it was God being
[49:12] misunderstood but I'm not very sure
[49:14] don't take me on that
[49:16] and there was a phrase that said
[49:21] three minutes
[49:23] before midnight
[49:26] so that struck me while I was sitting in
[49:29] the foyer I said three minutes before
[49:31] midnight this sounds very much like a
[49:34] sermon so after the sermon when I got
[49:36] home I just plugged it in searched three
[49:40] minutes before midnight Midnight nothing
[49:43] came up but it just it was so much on my
[49:46] heart I started feeding on it and I just
[49:49] it was leading me into one from one
[49:51] thing to the other
[49:53] and tonight by the grace of God we are
[49:57] going to talk about
[49:59] three minutes
[50:02] before midnight
[50:06] three minutes before midnight
[50:10] we are living in a time in fact in a
[50:14] very very dangerous time
[50:17] and if there was any time
[50:21] that we had to take off our cloak our
[50:23] human cloak and put on Christ
[50:26] it is now
[50:28] this is not a time to play
[50:32] this is a
[50:37] at which aisle of the which part of the
[50:39] aisle you belong
[50:41] right
[50:45] there is no time to play Church
[50:50] this is the time
[50:52] to really find out who you truly are and
[50:56] where you stand
[51:00] at work today a colleague had his 15 15
[51:03] year celebration
[51:05] so we had to stop work we didn't stop
[51:08] but we had finished with work we all
[51:10] gathered together just to eat
[51:13] and have fun
[51:15] and somebody says something he said he
[51:19] was playing Chris Christmas carols
[51:22] and another person told him I had to
[51:24] listen to this type of music
[51:26] and there was somebody sitting right
[51:29] next to me who said yeah I couldn't
[51:31] listen to that for one month
[51:35] and then it blows my mind
[51:38] to think that there are people that
[51:40] cannot listen to Christmas carols for a
[51:42] month
[51:43] but they can listen to one rock and roll
[51:46] every single day for one month and they
[51:48] don't have a problem
[51:51] so the whole place was quiet and I said
[51:54] I have a problem with that
[51:57] I said
[51:59] because everywhere on the platform there
[52:02] are radios
[52:03] I said
[52:04] a lot of the times you hear people
[52:07] playing songs
[52:09] and I said they have filthy songs by my
[52:11] standard
[52:13] they are songs I will call filthy but I
[52:16] said I have never complained
[52:18] I have never told them I don't like this
[52:20] music
[52:21] but I just do my work
[52:24] knowing that I don't like it
[52:27] so why would somebody be playing A
[52:29] Christmas Carol and somebody will say I
[52:32] don't like this music
[52:35] I said I have a problem with it
[52:40] and the whole place was going
[52:44] and I remember
[52:46] that happened before
[52:49] between somebody and I and we sorted it
[52:51] out
[52:55] now
[53:00] you are the one under under attack no
[53:04] you are not under attack
[53:08] the Lord Jesus Christ is the one under
[53:10] attack
[53:16] when you take on Christ
[53:20] then you come in the Firing Lane
[53:23] because you have taken on Christ and he
[53:26] is under attack then you are under
[53:28] attack
[53:29] that is why the Bible says that the
[53:32] battle is not your battle it is the Lost
[53:34] battle it is not yours
[53:43] so if there was any time
[53:46] that we have to put on Christ and be
[53:48] proud of who we truly are it is in this
[53:51] day and age because Christ
[53:54] is under attack
[53:57] except we suffer with him there is no
[54:00] way
[54:01] we can reign with him
[54:03] we are just partakers
[54:05] of his suffering praise be to God
[54:09] in time
[54:10] I am here to tell us to remind us I'm
[54:14] too new
[54:16] the topic May
[54:18] take me three minutes before midnight
[54:21] I don't know how it's going to end
[54:25] but I'm here to remind us
[54:29] that it is later than we think
[54:32] that it is homegoing time
[54:37] it's homegoing time
[54:39] one time the Lord Jesus
[54:42] was with his disciples
[54:45] and they came and they told him
[54:48] they were just showing him the bodies of
[54:50] the Temple
[54:51] and he told them that there is coming a
[54:54] time that one stone
[54:57] would not remain stand on another
[55:01] and when he went up the mountain Mount
[55:04] Olive and sat down the Bible says they
[55:08] came to him privately and to ask him
[55:11] what time
[55:13] is it going to be
[55:15] and when you read the Bible he started
[55:18] talking about the end time
[55:21] talking about the end time or giving all
[55:24] the signs
[55:26] what to watch out for and when you look
[55:29] at all the signs
[55:32] you know nobody has to tell you that we
[55:36] are living
[55:38] in the end time it is homegoing time
[55:43] it's like we are working on a knife edge
[55:46] that is how
[55:49] we are to the end
[55:54] and he said
[55:56] that any generation that would live
[55:59] to see the Fig Leaf foot of leaves
[56:03] that generation
[56:05] would not pass
[56:07] until all these things be fulfilled
[56:10] talking about Israel Israel has become a
[56:13] nation since 1947 Ember brother said a
[56:17] generation is 40 years
[56:20] and when you do the math
[56:22] probably we are getting very close to
[56:24] 80. two generations
[56:26] oh it's so our generation is 40 and
[56:29] Christ said any generation that sees
[56:31] this signs that generation will not pass
[56:33] away God is Not slack
[56:36] concerning his promises as some
[56:41] [Music]
[56:47] repentance
[56:49] brother Branham said that we are living
[56:51] in a borrowed time
[56:54] on a borrowed time
[57:00] we don't know why the loss of the elect
[57:02] is
[57:05] he could come in tonight
[57:08] it could be tomorrow morning
[57:10] it could be tomorrow evening
[57:13] Jesus said oh that the father have given
[57:16] me
[57:17] he would not lose one
[57:21] and if he is tired of God
[57:25] there is no place for you here
[57:29] just get ready
[57:32] you either come crawling
[57:34] or you come walking or whichever way God
[57:36] is going to get you back he's going to
[57:38] get you but he's not going to lose you
[57:41] praise be to God
[57:44] we are in the homegoing time
[57:48] and I wonder
[57:51] I've never forgotten my topic
[57:53] three minutes
[57:55] before midnight we are in a homegoing
[57:58] Time
[57:59] I wonder how many of us
[58:02] are in the homegoing mode
[58:07] it does not have to be a lip service
[58:12] oh we are in the enter we are in the end
[58:13] time no the life you live
[58:18] what you meditate upon what your self is
[58:20] on the way you live should tell the
[58:23] story
[58:24] it shouldn't be a lip service
[58:28] that somebody can look at you and tell
[58:30] that you are preparing for something
[58:33] that may not be able to know what you
[58:35] are doing
[58:37] how many of us are in the homegoing mode
[58:40] it's like it's just like your car you
[58:43] had the four-wheel drive you have the
[58:45] four two-wheel drive now if you were
[58:48] driving in through Hill and you got into
[58:51] snow and the road was slippery and you
[58:54] were driving on two Hills making 75
[58:56] degrees I mean
[58:58] 75 miles per hour
[59:00] Lord have mercy
[59:05] and you got to a slippery place you
[59:08] think you'll still be driving in two
[59:10] wheel do a 75 degree ah oh my goodness
[59:14] what is wrong
[59:21] no
[59:22] you're going to slow down
[59:26] you select a different mode
[59:29] when the times change or when the
[59:33] seasons change
[59:35] it prompts a change
[59:39] in our lives
[59:44] I remember those days we used to go to
[59:46] the record dance just go and dance off
[59:48] our heads
[59:50] you'll be dancing a reggae song and I'll
[59:52] put you some different song you change
[59:55] the dance why because the music has
[59:57] changed
[1:00:00] times have changed
[1:00:03] times have changed
[1:00:05] they are no longer what they used to be
[1:00:09] but when you look at your life can you
[1:00:12] confidently say that your life has
[1:00:15] changed
[1:00:16] can you confidently say that your life
[1:00:19] measures up with the gospel can you say
[1:00:21] confidently without any Shadow of Doubt
[1:00:24] that you are no longer that person used
[1:00:27] to be
[1:00:29] or you are still hopping left and right
[1:00:32] hmm sure
[1:00:36] it's homegoing time
[1:00:38] how many of us
[1:00:40] are in a homecoming mode
[1:00:45] now
[1:00:49] I believe every one of you know what it
[1:00:51] means to be homesick
[1:00:54] if you are born and bred here
[1:00:56] um not quite
[1:00:58] but for those of us that have traveled
[1:01:00] across the Atlantic and across the
[1:01:03] Pacific to be here you know what it
[1:01:05] means to be homesick
[1:01:11] you sometimes
[1:01:13] something drove us here
[1:01:15] we came looking for greener pastures
[1:01:18] looking for a better life for ourselves
[1:01:20] of our children okay now you think back
[1:01:24] and you look at the life you once lived
[1:01:27] in
[1:01:28] you looked at the difficulties you
[1:01:31] looked at the financial
[1:01:33] difficulties you look at the problems
[1:01:35] the crimes the condition in which you
[1:01:38] wear you knew it was not the best
[1:01:41] sure that sometimes you didn't even have
[1:01:43] a room to yourself two three four people
[1:01:46] sleeping in one room
[1:01:50] and sometimes you have to eat together
[1:01:52] and you have to learn how to eat fast
[1:01:58] you didn't have the Comfort to just sit
[1:02:01] down and take your time and eat no
[1:02:04] no if you did that you may end up
[1:02:06] getting hungry
[1:02:08] so instead of chewing you have to learn
[1:02:10] to swallow
[1:02:13] and then you just fight and you roll in
[1:02:15] the Sun and what have you you end up
[1:02:17] going to sit by the Fireside to just
[1:02:19] tell stories go to bed wake up the
[1:02:22] following day
[1:02:23] you look at a life like this it doesn't
[1:02:26] look like it has any future
[1:02:28] now you'll find yourself here with all
[1:02:31] the blessings with all the prosperity
[1:02:34] and then you can look back to a life
[1:02:36] like that and then you still get
[1:02:38] homesick
[1:02:42] here he said that
[1:02:45] um
[1:02:47] well what did he say
[1:02:50] um
[1:02:51] that the home is a special place I'm
[1:02:53] trying to get this quote he just lived
[1:02:56] by
[1:02:57] there is no place like home
[1:03:00] and indeed there is no place like home
[1:03:06] sometimes
[1:03:08] with all the blessings you still want to
[1:03:10] go
[1:03:12] just to see the old friends to see the
[1:03:14] relatives
[1:03:15] sometimes just to walk the streets you
[1:03:18] once walked on before sometimes just to
[1:03:21] go and visit that school
[1:03:23] that old school
[1:03:26] just to I mean something about it wants
[1:03:29] you to go back
[1:03:31] and there is something about being
[1:03:33] homesick
[1:03:35] it tells of your origin
[1:03:40] I am a Ghanaian
[1:03:42] I can never say I'm homesick for China
[1:03:46] if I ever say that just do me a favor
[1:03:49] call the paramedics
[1:03:51] praise the Lord
[1:03:52] I can never
[1:03:55] I can be homesick for Ghana that tells
[1:03:58] you of my origin
[1:04:03] now
[1:04:05] does this surprise you
[1:04:08] that you get homesick for heaven
[1:04:11] does it ever surprise you
[1:04:14] that you get homesick for heaven
[1:04:21] if getting home sick
[1:04:24] naturally of a country you belong to
[1:04:27] tells of your origin your place of birth
[1:04:32] then what it also means that you getting
[1:04:35] home sick for heaven tells of your true
[1:04:38] origin
[1:04:40] because you can never get homesick
[1:04:42] forever for heaven if that was not your
[1:04:45] home
[1:04:48] the Bible says that God said let us make
[1:04:51] money in our own image
[1:04:53] and in the image of God he made man man
[1:04:57] was a spirit man before God forming Out
[1:04:59] of the Dust of the Earth
[1:05:01] we just bypassed our theophany to come
[1:05:04] into this life but this is not our home
[1:05:08] so it shouldn't surprise you
[1:05:11] when you begin to Crave for Heavenly
[1:05:13] things
[1:05:14] the Bible says
[1:05:22] treated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:05:25] Jesus
[1:05:30] you longing for heaven
[1:05:33] longing for heaven
[1:05:35] homesick for heaven
[1:05:38] that you can be seated here
[1:05:40] and yet you are lost
[1:05:44] somebody can look at you and tell that
[1:05:47] you are completely disconnected
[1:05:50] you are somewhere else
[1:05:53] that is what happens when you're
[1:05:54] homesick
[1:05:58] we are talking about three minutes to
[1:06:01] make time
[1:06:04] and when somebody is really homesick for
[1:06:06] a country
[1:06:07] and they want to travel and they are
[1:06:10] doing all their preparation
[1:06:12] you know they just sit down and their
[1:06:15] minds their spirit is just gone
[1:06:20] and they already are in that place while
[1:06:22] they are here
[1:06:24] before they ever make that Journey
[1:06:28] and they are searching the net trying to
[1:06:31] keep Pace with what is going on there
[1:06:34] they don't want to be led back and when
[1:06:36] I go why do I even want to visit what is
[1:06:38] new what is going on
[1:06:41] and I encourage you brothers and sisters
[1:06:46] that keep yourself in tune
[1:06:51] we are Heavenly beings
[1:06:54] we are not Earthly creatures
[1:06:57] we are Heavenly beings
[1:07:01] keep feeding on the world
[1:07:05] searching through the word
[1:07:08] keep meditating upon the world
[1:07:11] by day and by night not when it seems
[1:07:15] convenient
[1:07:19] praise be to God
[1:07:23] it's homegoing time
[1:07:25] we are very very very close
[1:07:30] to the end
[1:07:32] three minutes
[1:07:36] three minutes
[1:07:40] before midnight
[1:07:45] praise be to God
[1:07:48] now
[1:07:49] when you know
[1:07:53] that the end is here
[1:07:55] when you know that there is no more time
[1:07:59] when you know that we are living in the
[1:08:01] most dangerous times
[1:08:04] that a man could ever live in
[1:08:07] what you have to do
[1:08:10] that as you keep
[1:08:12] reading
[1:08:17] it's not enough to read
[1:08:24] the Bible says
[1:08:27] if I don't get to the message praise God
[1:08:29] the Bible says that my people perish
[1:08:33] for lack of knowledge
[1:08:38] you ought to make time
[1:08:43] life in America is so so busy
[1:08:48] life in America is in the fast lane
[1:08:54] you can get up from money till evening
[1:08:57] with a very very good intention you
[1:09:00] apply to such the scriptures read the
[1:09:01] message meditate upon the word of prayer
[1:09:04] or seek the face of God and the day just
[1:09:06] comes and passes by
[1:09:08] and before you away it's a week and
[1:09:10] before you away one month has come and
[1:09:12] gone and you have not done anything
[1:09:15] right
[1:09:17] you have to make time with God
[1:09:20] knowledge doesn't come
[1:09:22] just by sitting down on the back of your
[1:09:24] side just crossing your leg and enjoying
[1:09:27] no you have to make time with God
[1:09:33] and as good as knowledge is
[1:09:36] knowledge would not benefit you
[1:09:39] if you don't apply that knowledge
[1:09:48] you must have that wisdom them of God
[1:09:51] to rightly apply
[1:09:53] the knowledge of God
[1:09:57] knowledge without its application
[1:10:01] will still not benefit you
[1:10:04] the Bible says we are living Epistles
[1:10:09] apply the word to your life
[1:10:13] live by the word
[1:10:15] the word is our absolute
[1:10:19] praise be to God
[1:10:26] it's a time to keep consecrating
[1:10:28] ourselves
[1:10:30] a Time
[1:10:32] you keep purging ourselves
[1:10:35] because
[1:10:36] eternity
[1:10:37] is actually closing in
[1:10:39] on us
[1:10:41] and time
[1:10:43] is running out
[1:10:48] eternity is closing in on us and time
[1:10:51] is running out
[1:10:56] three minutes before midnight
[1:10:59] now
[1:11:01] a day
[1:11:04] is made up of 24 hours
[1:11:07] times 60 minutes
[1:11:10] I did the math already
[1:11:12] 8
[1:11:14] 440 minutes
[1:11:19] 1440 minutes in a day
[1:11:22] so if you got up in the morning
[1:11:26] and you had
[1:11:28] 1440 minutes
[1:11:30] you know you have time it's a lot of
[1:11:33] time
[1:11:34] when you are down to a thousand you know
[1:11:36] you have a lot of time
[1:11:39] you'll get down to 500 you know you
[1:11:41] still have time
[1:11:45] but when you get to three minutes
[1:11:50] we are not talking of three minutes
[1:11:54] just three minutes in a vacuum no
[1:11:57] we are talking of three minutes
[1:12:02] to midnight
[1:12:05] so put it in context
[1:12:10] now if from
[1:12:12] 1440 minutes you have come all the way
[1:12:16] down to three minutes to midnight what
[1:12:19] it tells you is that you have run out of
[1:12:22] time
[1:12:23] what it tells you is that you don't
[1:12:26] anymore have time on your hand
[1:12:29] right praise be to God
[1:12:36] we are living in a very uncertain moment
[1:12:41] this life
[1:12:42] is very very uncertain
[1:12:47] I remember last last month I was just
[1:12:51] sitting with a colleague he comes from
[1:12:52] West Africa too and he was talking to
[1:12:55] somebody tried to console him
[1:12:59] not knowing that fellow was going to die
[1:13:01] the same day
[1:13:02] he lost his mother on Sunday the
[1:13:05] following day was Monday and he was
[1:13:08] consoling him
[1:13:09] and guess what the following day was
[1:13:12] Tuesday they were calling him and they
[1:13:14] were not getting him
[1:13:15] he he was a truck driver
[1:13:18] he got to the the stopover or however
[1:13:21] they call it and then he slept in the
[1:13:24] truck and that ended the story
[1:13:27] and they called the police because they
[1:13:30] knew his last location and they told the
[1:13:32] police this was why he was the last time
[1:13:34] we spoke with him
[1:13:35] and if it had been three days now the
[1:13:38] police went there and then they found
[1:13:40] out he was in the truck and he was dead
[1:13:43] that is how uncertain this life is now
[1:13:47] my question is
[1:13:49] in the final three moments in the final
[1:13:53] three minutes
[1:13:55] of his life what was on his heart
[1:14:00] because this brother was telling me
[1:14:03] that he just finished building his house
[1:14:06] hmm
[1:14:07] and Sierra Leone and he walled around it
[1:14:13] everything completely done
[1:14:16] and his diet gone and left it behind
[1:14:22] so everything he told for
[1:14:25] is completely useless
[1:14:29] it doesn't mean we don't have to work
[1:14:32] it doesn't mean we don't have to acquire
[1:14:33] property if God gives you go for it
[1:14:37] right but remember
[1:14:40] that these are things
[1:14:42] we are just going to use while we are
[1:14:44] here
[1:14:45] just for a little comfort
[1:14:47] just for a little comfort
[1:14:51] but there is a land
[1:14:53] Beyond
[1:14:55] what we are going to spend eternity
[1:14:58] and what choices
[1:15:00] are you making in life
[1:15:04] what are the choices you are making
[1:15:08] three minutes
[1:15:12] three minutes doesn't mean anything
[1:15:17] but if you have three minutes to
[1:15:19] midnight
[1:15:21] and midnight is a Tipping Point
[1:15:26] that when you go beyond midnight you are
[1:15:30] going from one day to another day
[1:15:32] you will never come back
[1:15:35] to the previous day is God and is gone
[1:15:38] for good
[1:15:43] so when you have three minutes to make
[1:15:44] midnight
[1:15:47] let's just use this an example those of
[1:15:50] you are in school or those of you who
[1:15:52] just went through the system you know
[1:15:55] that when you are given an assignment
[1:15:57] and they say the assignment is due at 11
[1:15:59] 59.
[1:16:06] and you are you you are
[1:16:08] your assignment you are covering what
[1:16:10] you have done and you are just going
[1:16:12] through just sitting down with a mouse
[1:16:15] in your hand just waiting to click Send
[1:16:17] or submit
[1:16:19] you are just comfortable
[1:16:22] the same cannot be said
[1:16:25] with somebody
[1:16:29] that has not fully completed their work
[1:16:33] either they are Midway either they are
[1:16:35] food and material together they are not
[1:16:37] sure of what they have and they look at
[1:16:39] the time and it's three minutes to
[1:16:41] midnight you are supposed to submit your
[1:16:43] work at 11 59. guess what you get more
[1:16:47] so confused
[1:16:49] there are some instructors who will not
[1:16:52] even look at your work
[1:16:53] if it is a minute late
[1:16:56] some will look at it and they'll do that
[1:16:58] some points
[1:17:00] some may show Grace
[1:17:05] so when the odds are against you
[1:17:10] it is not a comfortable place to be
[1:17:16] when everything is all right that is
[1:17:19] good but when the US are against you
[1:17:22] three minutes to midnight
[1:17:26] is not a comfortable place
[1:17:29] to be
[1:17:34] it can be good
[1:17:37] and it can be bad
[1:17:39] depending on where you are standing
[1:17:43] praise be to God
[1:17:49] it's a Time
[1:17:54] to keep consecrating ourselves
[1:17:58] don't seek to do something new
[1:18:01] or something no man has done before
[1:18:06] just consecrate keep consecrating
[1:18:08] yourself
[1:18:10] keep believing and keep trusting
[1:18:13] be pushing on
[1:18:18] there is a lot
[1:18:21] will go through
[1:18:26] and there is a good reason
[1:18:28] why every single day
[1:18:31] you have to consecrate yourself
[1:18:36] there is a good reason
[1:18:38] why you have to keep pledging yourself
[1:18:40] every single day
[1:18:43] like the sea
[1:18:49] the sea is always
[1:18:52] in a joyful mood
[1:18:55] if you were going to the Sea
[1:18:58] to the shore
[1:19:00] you are going to hear the sound of the
[1:19:01] waves
[1:19:03] it's always rejoicing
[1:19:06] but
[1:19:08] a lot of the Radioactive
[1:19:11] probably they have stopped
[1:19:14] that is The Dumping Ground
[1:19:16] but the sea keeps Paving itself
[1:19:19] single day it has
[1:19:23] a single day the sea is paging itself
[1:19:26] every single day this is happening
[1:19:29] having arrival
[1:19:32] and we ought to be pegging ourselves
[1:19:34] knowing that we are getting very very
[1:19:37] close to the end
[1:19:42] never depart from the world
[1:19:46] like a friend was telling me somewhere
[1:19:48] last two weeks
[1:19:50] about his marriage
[1:19:52] the first question I asked him
[1:19:56] I said you go to church
[1:19:58] oh everything changes everything I said
[1:20:01] no do I say don't laugh
[1:20:03] I said do you pray in the house
[1:20:06] he says sometimes
[1:20:09] I said does your wife go to church
[1:20:11] he said I can't I don't I don't know
[1:20:15] you are living in the house you are the
[1:20:16] man of the house
[1:20:18] you don't even know what a wife goes to
[1:20:19] church or not
[1:20:21] I said well I have a lot of things to
[1:20:23] tell you but the first thing I will tell
[1:20:25] you is that start going to church
[1:20:29] and he started I said no I'm not joking
[1:20:31] I said stop going to church
[1:20:33] I say you have thrown God out of your
[1:20:35] home that is how you have those problems
[1:20:41] when you throw God out of your home you
[1:20:44] have nothing left
[1:20:48] never depart from the world
[1:20:55] say with the word
[1:20:59] feed on the word
[1:21:02] meditate upon the world
[1:21:07] always look at your life oh my
[1:21:11] examine yourself
[1:21:14] see why you are standing with the word
[1:21:17] praise be to God
[1:21:41] now you may have realized by now
[1:21:46] that there is nothing Under the Sun that
[1:21:49] brings Joy
[1:21:51] you may have realized
[1:21:53] that there is nothing under the sun
[1:21:56] that actually satisfies you
[1:22:03] sometimes
[1:22:05] for those that are poor
[1:22:10] you will think maybe when I get money
[1:22:13] I'll be fine
[1:22:14] you get the money you realize you're not
[1:22:16] fine
[1:22:20] sometimes people are just any for
[1:22:23] recognition
[1:22:25] when you gave when you become a
[1:22:27] prominent person
[1:22:29] or you become famous
[1:22:32] you'll be fine
[1:22:34] they become prominent they become famous
[1:22:37] and they realize that no
[1:22:38] that wasn't it
[1:22:41] a lot of them take drugs and they die in
[1:22:44] their in their in their bathtubs we hear
[1:22:46] the story
[1:22:47] right
[1:22:50] sometimes you think oh it's because I'm
[1:22:52] single why now when I marry oh I'll be
[1:22:56] fine life will be so good and then you
[1:22:59] get married and they realize that the
[1:23:01] honeymoon is just for only two weeks
[1:23:06] praise the Lord
[1:23:10] there are a lot of things
[1:23:13] our hearts go for
[1:23:15] and you will think that when I get this
[1:23:17] then I got it
[1:23:20] when you get it they realize no
[1:23:22] it doesn't even mean anything anymore
[1:23:25] oh the excitement is gone through the
[1:23:28] window
[1:23:29] it doesn't satisfy
[1:23:32] there is nothing rewarding the only
[1:23:35] thing that satisfies and the only thing
[1:23:37] that is rewarding
[1:23:39] is just Christ and him alone
[1:23:46] do not let anything
[1:23:51] carry your attention
[1:23:53] away from the most important things
[1:24:01] nothing under the sun
[1:24:04] satisfies
[1:24:05] the only place
[1:24:07] and Son of God the other place a
[1:24:10] daughter of God will find satisfaction
[1:24:12] is in Christ
[1:24:15] anything outside of Christ
[1:24:18] you are not standing sure
[1:24:23] three minutes before midnight I'm going
[1:24:26] to start it now
[1:24:29] praise be to God now it's a time of time
[1:24:32] of agency
[1:24:34] three minutes before midnight
[1:24:37] of agency
[1:24:40] it's a time that keeps you on your toes
[1:24:45] that you don't do things
[1:24:48] a normal person does
[1:24:52] that things just change why because time
[1:24:55] is running out
[1:24:57] you can have a fire service uh a fire
[1:25:00] firefighter come to the house maybe your
[1:25:02] alarm is going off and you call the
[1:25:04] firefighter and he comes he takes his
[1:25:07] time he comes he knocks at the door and
[1:25:09] then oh come in and then he comes and
[1:25:11] inspect they say firefighter comes
[1:25:15] when there is fire on the house he
[1:25:17] doesn't need your attention to enter the
[1:25:19] house
[1:25:20] because he knows that time is running
[1:25:22] out on the souls in the house
[1:25:25] praise be to God and here in America you
[1:25:29] see firefighters so I'm not surprised
[1:25:31] when they ask some of these small
[1:25:33] children what do you want to be when you
[1:25:34] grow and they sound to be a firefighter
[1:25:36] I'm not surprised because these are
[1:25:38] courageous man
[1:25:40] I know of places
[1:25:43] that they have never put a fire
[1:25:45] sometimes I will come when the place is
[1:25:48] on fire they will come and look at the
[1:25:49] size of the fire before they even go and
[1:25:51] get water
[1:26:00] don't wait
[1:26:02] till the structure is bent down before
[1:26:05] they see them in the street poor people
[1:26:08] people pee and they come the place is
[1:26:11] just
[1:26:12] in everything is consumed
[1:26:15] and then they come and stand and they
[1:26:17] are spraying the smoke
[1:26:23] but here in America they are
[1:26:25] firefighters
[1:26:26] my goodness
[1:26:28] I don't want to go too much in that
[1:26:29] direction we are already out of time
[1:26:34] so when a man is running out of time
[1:26:39] there is something about them
[1:26:42] you see people when they are late for
[1:26:45] work
[1:26:46] and they're on the highway
[1:26:49] they drive like they are losing it
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:53] you see people working to work and they
[1:26:56] are late you see the way they are
[1:26:58] walking it tells you that there is
[1:27:00] agency
[1:27:02] when you see their lives it tells you
[1:27:05] you don't have to tell you you can tell
[1:27:08] that there is something going on
[1:27:11] and we are living in a time of agency
[1:27:15] in the most crucial time ever
[1:27:23] do we have that agency
[1:27:26] are we are we at least like we are so
[1:27:29] relaxed
[1:27:31] so so so relaxed
[1:27:33] like we have all the day to ourselves
[1:27:37] forgetting that we are running out of
[1:27:39] time
[1:27:45] and as we go down you will see we are
[1:27:49] talking about three minutes to midnight
[1:27:50] but you realize that we don't actually
[1:27:53] have three minutes to midnight
[1:27:55] praise be to God
[1:28:01] we are not just talking about midnight
[1:28:05] because my brother said somewhere that
[1:28:08] we are waiting for midnight
[1:28:10] to March out of here
[1:28:13] so if it were midnight would not be here
[1:28:16] but we are talking of three minutes to
[1:28:20] midnight
[1:28:21] a Time
[1:28:24] even though it's not enough
[1:28:27] even though time is running out it's
[1:28:30] enough time
[1:28:32] to make a right turn
[1:28:36] even though there is no time even though
[1:28:39] time is running out on us it is enough
[1:28:42] time
[1:28:43] to start making the right choices
[1:28:49] it gives us enough room
[1:28:55] to do an introspection
[1:28:58] set our hearts search Our Lives and
[1:29:02] start making the right decisions
[1:29:07] praise be to God
[1:29:09] three minutes
[1:29:13] before midnight
[1:29:16] something is about to strike
[1:29:19] and praise be to God
[1:29:21] has so much loved us
[1:29:24] that he has sent us a prophet with a
[1:29:27] message
[1:29:29] to turn our hearts to the Faith of Our
[1:29:31] Fathers before he strikes the Earth with
[1:29:35] a kiss
[1:29:36] something is about to happen
[1:29:38] count yourself blessed
[1:29:41] and after you have had this message
[1:29:44] the message of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:47] and then you find yourself
[1:29:51] God forbid
[1:29:54] with somebody that never believes
[1:29:57] tomorrow you blame yourself
[1:30:00] you don't blame God for it
[1:30:03] everything we need to overcome has been
[1:30:06] given us
[1:30:07] we are not in the dark
[1:30:10] I have heard people say that if I don't
[1:30:13] make it I'll be a foolish virgin you
[1:30:15] will never be a foolish virgin
[1:30:18] as a matter of fact the foolish version
[1:30:20] does not even know
[1:30:22] that's just a foolish version right she
[1:30:25] doesn't know
[1:30:29] when the time comes and they don't make
[1:30:32] itself
[1:30:34] so yeah there was something I was
[1:30:36] missing
[1:30:37] may you and I know better than that
[1:30:41] you and I know better than that
[1:30:44] the Bible says to whom much
[1:30:50] stories coming in I will just leave it
[1:30:52] alone for now
[1:30:53] praise be to God
[1:31:00] now
[1:31:02] midnight
[1:31:04] is the darkest time of the night
[1:31:09] according to science
[1:31:15] that's when the sun is farthest away
[1:31:22] and it also goes without argument
[1:31:25] that The Darkest Hour of the night is
[1:31:28] Just Before Sunrise
[1:31:32] because if the sun rises here
[1:31:39] it has to go one revolution to come back
[1:31:42] again
[1:31:43] now when it goes all the way to the end
[1:31:47] here
[1:31:48] that is when the sun has gone farthest
[1:31:51] from this point
[1:31:52] and you have the darkest moment but
[1:31:55] again it happens to be the time that the
[1:31:58] sun is going to make a U-turn and then
[1:32:00] shine again
[1:32:03] so the darkest moment
[1:32:05] science says
[1:32:07] it's midnight and that is when the sun
[1:32:10] is farthest away
[1:32:13] and three minutes to midnight talks
[1:32:16] about living in the darkest moment of
[1:32:19] the day
[1:32:22] three minutes before midnight
[1:32:26] that means you are living in the darkest
[1:32:29] moment of the day
[1:32:32] it is also it also talks about how far
[1:32:35] away the Sun is
[1:32:38] from the West
[1:32:40] and how close
[1:32:42] it is to the east
[1:32:46] and without a doubt we are living in the
[1:32:49] darkest moment in human history
[1:32:52] there is gross Darkness on the land
[1:32:56] grass Darkness on the land and that
[1:33:00] tells us how far away the Gospel Light
[1:33:03] has traveled from the West that is from
[1:33:06] the Gentile dispensation
[1:33:08] back towards the east that is to the
[1:33:12] Jews
[1:33:14] praise be to God
[1:33:16] and when the gospel returns to the Jews
[1:33:18] it never comes back again
[1:33:21] to the Gentiles
[1:33:23] that is going to be the end
[1:33:27] the gospel is just not returning to the
[1:33:29] east
[1:33:30] the gospel is going back to its origin
[1:33:36] praise be to God
[1:33:38] salvation is of the Lord
[1:33:41] he came to you he came to his own
[1:33:45] and his own received him not
[1:33:48] they were blinded for our sake
[1:33:52] but when the gospel goes back
[1:33:57] that closes the door
[1:34:00] on the Gentile disposition
[1:34:06] we must get a hold of God
[1:34:10] we must get a hold of God
[1:34:14] praise be to God
[1:34:17] told Moses
[1:34:20] the scripture will just write
[1:34:22] an Aaron
[1:34:26] that he was going to send one more
[1:34:28] plague
[1:34:30] to pharaoh
[1:34:32] and Egyptians and this time
[1:34:35] Pharaoh would let them go
[1:34:38] Not only would he let them go but he was
[1:34:41] going to stress them and to trust is
[1:34:44] just like throw something away
[1:34:47] he had no choice but to stress them out
[1:34:52] and God told Moses and Aaron to tell the
[1:34:55] children of Israel to get a lamp for
[1:34:58] each family and why the family was small
[1:35:01] poor families could come together and
[1:35:04] kill alarm and we know the story and
[1:35:06] they should apply the blood
[1:35:08] on the letter post on the door post and
[1:35:12] on the lentil of the door
[1:35:15] and wherever there was the blood
[1:35:17] wherever the blood was applied the deaf
[1:35:20] Angel was not going to go in there
[1:35:24] but anyway there was no blood applied
[1:35:28] the deaf Angel was going to go in and
[1:35:31] the first born
[1:35:33] Pharaoh right down to the firstborn or
[1:35:36] whosoever was in the dungeon of both
[1:35:39] animal and men
[1:35:40] we're going to die
[1:35:45] three minutes before midnight
[1:35:50] three minutes before midnight
[1:35:55] I could just imagine
[1:36:00] the children of Israel
[1:36:01] applying the blood
[1:36:04] applying the token
[1:36:07] because endless 11 says about midnight
[1:36:12] I will pass through the land
[1:36:14] and exodus 12 29 says at midnight
[1:36:18] the deaf Angel went through the land
[1:36:21] so three minutes to midnight I could
[1:36:24] just imagine how they were just busy
[1:36:27] applying the token busy applying the
[1:36:30] blood and they were not sitting down
[1:36:32] they were not lying down they were not
[1:36:34] sleeping they were eating as they were
[1:36:38] in prepressing mode
[1:36:40] their feet were in their shoes
[1:36:43] they guide their lives they hide their
[1:36:46] stuff in their hands and they were ready
[1:36:48] to March out
[1:36:50] as they were applying the token
[1:36:53] three minutes
[1:36:55] before midnight
[1:36:57] before the angel the deaf angel
[1:37:00] struck
[1:37:02] they were busy
[1:37:03] playing the token
[1:37:06] three minutes
[1:37:09] before midnight
[1:37:17] and a deaf angel
[1:37:20] struck everyone
[1:37:22] except under the blood
[1:37:25] the only place
[1:37:28] strike
[1:37:30] was under the blood
[1:37:32] and today as Midnight Hour is
[1:37:35] approaching the only safe place is under
[1:37:39] the blood
[1:37:42] praise be to God
[1:37:44] death will strike everywhere
[1:37:48] accepts
[1:37:50] under the blood
[1:37:52] and if you are looking for a hideout
[1:37:55] if you are looking for a safe place to
[1:37:57] hide it's under the blood
[1:38:01] in the message the sign of the Messiah
[1:38:06] every Bible teacher knows that the
[1:38:09] gentle dispensation
[1:38:11] is the end
[1:38:13] and here's to tell you
[1:38:14] intellige you
[1:38:15] and God has had in the heart of Hitler
[1:38:18] Mussolini all them dictators and Russia
[1:38:23] and run those Jews right back into
[1:38:26] Palestine
[1:38:28] where they supposed to be standing there
[1:38:32] I got a picture
[1:38:34] three minutes before midnight according
[1:38:36] to science and those Jews those Jews
[1:38:40] coming in
[1:38:42] with packing their loved ones
[1:38:45] old on their back you see
[1:38:50] it is in the look magazine
[1:38:53] coming down from Iran and those places
[1:38:58] and you coming back
[1:39:01] let me just backtrack a little
[1:39:04] um packing does all juice in and a
[1:39:07] friend of mine went to them
[1:39:09] got in
[1:39:13] with a quarter crumb color said
[1:39:15] are you coming back to the Homeland to
[1:39:17] die
[1:39:19] said no
[1:39:20] we are coming back to see the Messiah
[1:39:23] we are not coming back to die
[1:39:25] we are coming back to see the Messiah
[1:39:28] Jesus said when the Fig Tree Grows I
[1:39:32] mean it goes to put him forth his bars
[1:39:34] this generation 40 years shall not cease
[1:39:38] until all these things be fulfilled
[1:39:42] do you get it
[1:39:45] what's happening
[1:39:46] the last call
[1:39:48] for the Gentiles
[1:39:51] the nations are ready to be pulverized
[1:39:54] at any time
[1:39:56] and to think of it before that can
[1:39:59] happen the church
[1:40:02] goes home first
[1:40:04] praise be to God
[1:40:06] and if we could
[1:40:08] if if we could be pulverized before
[1:40:11] morning
[1:40:13] and the judgment
[1:40:15] and about going home of the church
[1:40:19] it could come any minute
[1:40:22] certainly wake up people
[1:40:25] shake your spiritual Souls Within You by
[1:40:28] reading the word we are at the end time
[1:40:31] the time is at hand we've had theology
[1:40:35] we've had Church age but this is the
[1:40:38] time and now the last sign to the Jew
[1:40:43] was that was what
[1:40:45] the appearing
[1:40:47] of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:50] the last sign to the Gentile is the
[1:40:53] coming is him coming in the spirit of
[1:40:58] the Holy Ghost back into his church
[1:41:00] doing the same things that he did then
[1:41:04] to declare himself the same yesterday
[1:41:07] today and forever praise be to God
[1:41:11] so we are at a very very very end
[1:41:15] and when all the confusion started in
[1:41:19] Ukraine and there was this
[1:41:22] um
[1:41:22] information about
[1:41:24] putting putting says he's ready to go to
[1:41:27] use nuclear arms
[1:41:30] and mind you
[1:41:33] nobody knows whether he was boosting or
[1:41:36] he meant it nobody knows
[1:41:40] that we are admonished
[1:41:42] to watch Russia
[1:41:45] and what Russia has
[1:41:50] America is a great superpower but
[1:41:53] America doesn't have it
[1:41:55] the Satan too they have it
[1:41:58] and it looks like they gave it the right
[1:42:00] name Satan too
[1:42:05] and he was busting
[1:42:06] he will use he will use it
[1:42:09] nobody knew
[1:42:12] he was just one day going to get crazy
[1:42:15] and then just extract them
[1:42:17] or somebody will just get crazy and
[1:42:19] saying I'm just I'm really tired with
[1:42:21] this world and just press the button
[1:42:23] that is how close we are
[1:42:27] my brother is saying that before we hit
[1:42:29] that point
[1:42:31] the church will be out of here
[1:42:33] that should tell you how close how close
[1:42:37] the church is to the end
[1:42:40] it is almost three minutes
[1:42:43] we are seconds away from Midnight
[1:42:47] circus away from Midnight
[1:42:53] I swear brother was asking a question I
[1:42:56] think it's in um
[1:42:58] question and answers he said
[1:43:01] do you know
[1:43:05] I'm just paraphrasing it now
[1:43:08] that by sunrise tomorrow morning
[1:43:13] we will be out of here
[1:43:16] by sunrise tomorrow morning
[1:43:19] and see how many years now since he
[1:43:21] passed
[1:43:26] if there was any time to mean business
[1:43:29] with God
[1:43:31] this is the time
[1:43:33] praise be to God
[1:43:35] in the message God's provided way
[1:43:38] did he notice just in the anti-delivian
[1:43:42] world before that Noah before that the
[1:43:46] first drop of rain ever fell Noah went
[1:43:50] into the ark in the death of Sodom
[1:43:53] before one bit of fire ever fell from
[1:43:57] heaven that angel said to Lord make
[1:44:00] tastes come hither for I can't do
[1:44:04] nothing till you come out of there
[1:44:08] praise be to God
[1:44:10] in fact God cannot do anything until we
[1:44:14] live here
[1:44:17] we are the one holding back the wrath of
[1:44:20] God
[1:44:21] that God looks down and he sees his sons
[1:44:25] and daughters and that alone
[1:44:28] cools his heart
[1:44:31] when we are out of here it's a different
[1:44:33] thing
[1:44:34] and remember
[1:44:37] even though lot and his wife and
[1:44:40] children came out
[1:44:41] his wife didn't make it
[1:44:45] coming out is not enough
[1:44:48] coming out is not enough
[1:44:52] there is a saying that you can take the
[1:44:55] baboon out of the forest but you can't
[1:44:57] take the forest out of the baboon
[1:45:00] but in this race
[1:45:03] the forest must be taken out
[1:45:07] praise be to God
[1:45:09] it is not enough
[1:45:11] to come out of the world and still have
[1:45:14] the word in your heart
[1:45:27] the next word that takes place
[1:45:30] will only last
[1:45:33] I take it again the next world that
[1:45:36] takes place will only be three minutes
[1:45:38] long
[1:45:40] three minutes
[1:45:42] no wonder size sizes is three minutes
[1:45:45] till midnight
[1:45:47] three minutes is all it will take to
[1:45:51] rock the world completely to pieces and
[1:45:56] blow it up
[1:45:57] we are living on borrowed time
[1:46:01] the prophet speaking and God's provided
[1:46:04] why
[1:46:05] the Earth is bulging out
[1:46:08] the sun doesn't go around its orbit like
[1:46:13] it used to do
[1:46:14] everything is indicating that
[1:46:17] that coming of the lord we are right at
[1:46:20] the door
[1:46:21] and remember before one of those Bobs
[1:46:24] can drop
[1:46:25] don't forget this Jesus said as it was
[1:46:28] in the days of Noah and in the days of
[1:46:30] Lord so shall it be at the coming of the
[1:46:33] son of man and before Noah before the
[1:46:36] rain fell down Noah was in the ark
[1:46:38] safely before
[1:46:43] Lord was outside and before one bomb can
[1:46:47] strike the church
[1:46:49] will be home in glory
[1:46:52] God in good praise be to God
[1:46:56] praise the Lord
[1:47:03] talking about the somebody out in the
[1:47:05] sun doesn't go around its orbit like the
[1:47:07] way it used to do so something happened
[1:47:10] to me one day if it's not long
[1:47:13] I'll be closer very soon the time is up
[1:47:18] normally I would my my alarm would go up
[1:47:21] at 4 30.
[1:47:23] and a lot of the times I'll be up before
[1:47:25] then
[1:47:27] so I woke up
[1:47:30] and uh I needed to use the restroom
[1:47:34] but I didn't want to go use the restroom
[1:47:36] and then come back
[1:47:39] and then my alarm goes off and I have to
[1:47:42] go back
[1:47:43] so I looked at a time
[1:47:46] and the time was three
[1:47:50] fifty nine
[1:47:52] 359
[1:47:55] I said no I have 30 minutes
[1:47:58] to sell rests in bed so I went to the
[1:48:01] restroom
[1:48:02] I didn't spend two minutes in the
[1:48:04] restroom
[1:48:05] and I came back
[1:48:07] as soon as I got back and I lay on the
[1:48:10] bed my alarm started going off
[1:48:14] I have never understood that
[1:48:18] I have never understood that
[1:48:21] that is how fast
[1:48:24] that is how fast
[1:48:26] time
[1:48:27] is running away
[1:48:30] that is how fast
[1:48:32] eternity is closing in
[1:48:36] it's just too fast I have never
[1:48:39] understood that
[1:48:41] and there is nothing to explain that
[1:48:45] that I go to the restroom
[1:48:47] in less than 90 seconds I come out
[1:48:51] from 359
[1:48:54] is already 4 30.
[1:48:58] that should give you sleepless night
[1:49:02] you have to watch every step you take
[1:49:05] you have to watch the life you are
[1:49:07] living
[1:49:09] keep examining yourself
[1:49:13] we all have work to do
[1:49:17] keep consecrating yourself
[1:49:21] let's keep praying for one another
[1:49:24] let's keep one another before the Lord
[1:49:26] praise be to God speak to the Rock
[1:49:29] for I believe the meeting is at hand
[1:49:34] I believe the meeting is at hand right
[1:49:36] now that's going to bring the gospel
[1:49:39] back to the Jews again in Palestine
[1:49:41] and then the Gentiles is finished
[1:49:45] when the Jews receive the Holy Ghost
[1:49:47] again in Palestine the Gentiles are
[1:49:50] finished
[1:49:51] you scream cry do what speak to the rock
[1:49:55] you want to but Mercy has returned to
[1:49:59] Israel again that's right and the
[1:50:02] Gentiles they will throw down the Walls
[1:50:06] until the gentle dispensation be
[1:50:09] finished and then it's over for you
[1:50:13] so you get right now with God
[1:50:16] be sure that you are right
[1:50:20] and don't pay any attention to this
[1:50:23] little old weak this was stuff
[1:50:26] you'll get
[1:50:28] you get into the strong power of the
[1:50:32] Holy Spirit
[1:50:33] that has changed your innermost being
[1:50:36] and made you what you wasn't yourself
[1:50:40] now how the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:50:45] is the only thing that can do that
[1:50:49] praise be to God
[1:50:51] it is not our effort your effort would
[1:50:54] not do
[1:50:56] what God has done he would never undo it
[1:51:01] right
[1:51:02] Peter's denial of him never stopped God
[1:51:09] first persecution of him never stopped
[1:51:13] him it's a prop executed yes Paul
[1:51:16] persecuted him
[1:51:17] on his way to Damascus when he was
[1:51:20] struck down by the pillar of Fire
[1:51:23] what is Jesus asking
[1:51:30] why persecuted down me
[1:51:34] that didn't stop God
[1:51:38] Thomas doubting
[1:51:40] did not stop God
[1:51:44] if you are a child of God
[1:51:48] you cannot stop God
[1:51:51] oh that the father has given him would
[1:51:54] come
[1:51:59] nothing nothing
[1:52:01] can take you away
[1:52:06] oh that the father had given him
[1:52:09] will come
[1:52:11] there is no place
[1:52:13] for a child of God in hell
[1:52:17] even if you chose it
[1:52:20] you'll be disappointed
[1:52:22] because there is no place there for you
[1:52:29] our souls are redeemed
[1:52:32] by the blood
[1:52:35] we have come this far
[1:52:37] by grace
[1:52:41] is what he has done
[1:52:45] we couldn't do anything it's what he has
[1:52:49] done that is what we are depending on
[1:52:52] and he will never let us down
[1:52:54] he would never fail us
[1:52:57] praise be to God
[1:52:59] Moses gave the command
[1:53:02] done to them to stay under there
[1:53:06] and here come the Midnight Hour
[1:53:09] I can hear the unrest
[1:53:12] and a little boy I can see him run up to
[1:53:15] his daddy and say Daddy
[1:53:19] what's that great noise
[1:53:21] the people all seem to be staring here
[1:53:25] says son God is going to send judgment
[1:53:27] Upon This Nation
[1:53:29] Daddy are we going to be killed no
[1:53:32] God has promised us if we were under the
[1:53:36] blood that we would not die praise be to
[1:53:40] God
[1:53:41] I remember brother one was preaching
[1:53:43] last last Sunday was was it Sunday
[1:53:47] I believe it was and he says something
[1:53:52] he said
[1:53:53] that a Rapture is a family event
[1:53:57] and that when you are packing your bag
[1:53:59] make sure that everybody's bag is packed
[1:54:04] this brings us right there this this
[1:54:07] this dialogue between his father and son
[1:54:10] just reminds me
[1:54:14] that when you are saved
[1:54:18] when you know
[1:54:20] that you are saved
[1:54:23] it doesn't end there
[1:54:26] you have to make sure
[1:54:28] that every member of the family
[1:54:31] is under the same token
[1:54:36] every member of this is under the same
[1:54:38] token I remember
[1:54:41] when Daniel and Joshua were in the
[1:54:43] streets
[1:54:44] one day I took my phone
[1:54:48] I don't know what I was writing but I
[1:54:50] wrote on it
[1:54:51] that we that our children
[1:54:55] uh what was it
[1:54:58] um
[1:55:02] I forgot I said what I wrote but I wrote
[1:55:04] We without our children
[1:55:08] oh my goodness I'm trying to get the
[1:55:10] last word
[1:55:12] maybe I'll just paraphrase it something
[1:55:14] like we without our children
[1:55:17] um actually
[1:55:18] I lost something like that but that
[1:55:21] wasn't what I wrote
[1:55:22] and then
[1:55:25] for a very long time
[1:55:28] I forgot of it
[1:55:30] and I was holding this phone
[1:55:33] and I was just doing something on the
[1:55:35] phone
[1:55:36] and this thing from nowhere just popped
[1:55:39] up on the phone
[1:55:42] we without our children
[1:55:45] have lost hope or something something
[1:55:48] and I started looking I said wow and
[1:55:51] honestly speaking that was not even a
[1:55:53] time I wanted to read that
[1:55:56] it was not a it was not a Time
[1:55:59] that I wanted to be reminded of that
[1:56:02] but it just came and said oh what is
[1:56:05] this again I didn't want to look at it
[1:56:07] but I was forced to read it
[1:56:10] so when it comes to our Salvation it's
[1:56:13] just not just it's not just you
[1:56:19] it's not just you and you alone
[1:56:24] everybody
[1:56:26] Under The Roof
[1:56:28] everybody under your umbrella
[1:56:31] it is your duty to make sure that they
[1:56:35] are under the same token
[1:56:40] you must be concerned
[1:56:44] the wrong thing is button
[1:56:47] to ask a brother brother are you saved
[1:56:49] sister are you saved
[1:56:52] some of the times people will take
[1:56:53] offense at it
[1:56:55] listen to the question he was asking me
[1:56:57] who are you ask me that question
[1:57:00] but I believe that if we are all in the
[1:57:03] right set of mind
[1:57:05] will not take offense at some of these
[1:57:07] things
[1:57:12] the sun was concerned
[1:57:15] when he had all the turmoil
[1:57:17] going on outside day
[1:57:20] he was he was just worried my daddy was
[1:57:23] saying that God has given us a promise
[1:57:26] that so long as we keep ourselves under
[1:57:29] the blood we are safe
[1:57:31] praise be to God
[1:57:33] the musicians can come over
[1:57:36] I'll be done in the next two three
[1:57:37] minutes
[1:57:38] praise the Lord
[1:57:40] brother
[1:57:41] a man has got to be born of the spirit
[1:57:47] of God
[1:57:48] regenerated washed in the blood of the
[1:57:52] Lamb with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:55] as God's Divine witness in his soul
[1:58:02] no two ways about it
[1:58:04] it's a must
[1:58:07] you have to get a hold of God
[1:58:09] and I'll tell you are certain
[1:58:14] you don't have to let go of God
[1:58:16] in the midst of the uncertainty
[1:58:20] there is a degree of certainty in Christ
[1:58:25] even though life is shot on Earth you
[1:58:29] can trade that short life with life in
[1:58:32] eternity with God
[1:58:37] there is life
[1:58:40] in Christ
[1:58:44] apply the token
[1:58:46] the deaf angel
[1:58:48] [Music]
[1:58:49] where am I
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:57] so that's true yes sir don't worry son
[1:59:00] everything is all right
[1:59:03] the death angel turn away
[1:59:06] that droughts may come the hard times
[1:59:09] may come you may be persecuted made fun
[1:59:12] of
[1:59:13] and everything
[1:59:14] but eternal life
[1:59:16] stays right there just the same praise
[1:59:22] be to God hallelujah
[1:59:24] let the never say what they want to say
[1:59:27] let the measure say what he wants to say
[1:59:30] let the doctor say what he wants to do
[1:59:34] take away
[1:59:36] eternal life
[1:59:37] is the gift of God
[1:59:40] that was given by the Holy Spirit it
[1:59:44] can't go away
[1:59:46] is the Holy Spirit
[1:59:49] the deaf Angels struck everywhere except
[1:59:52] under the blood
[1:59:54] the other place
[1:59:56] death couldn't strike was under the
[1:59:59] blood
[2:00:00] and today
[2:00:02] as the Midnight Hour is approaching
[2:00:06] the only safe place to be is under the
[2:00:10] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00:12] death
[2:00:14] will not strike
[2:00:17] anywhere under the blood
[2:00:19] three minutes before midnight
[2:00:23] as I said a while ago
[2:00:26] it's later than we think
[2:00:28] but not too late
[2:00:31] to turn to him
[2:00:33] not too late to make things right
[2:00:36] not too late to seek his face
[2:00:41] we are now seconds away from his coming
[2:00:48] of the time
[2:00:50] and the hour no Snowman
[2:00:55] but we can tell
[2:00:57] from the science
[2:01:00] that we are right at the very end of
[2:01:05] this journey
[2:01:07] there is enough time to do something
[2:01:09] about the situation
[2:01:11] there is only one safe place
[2:01:14] which is in Christ Jesus
[2:01:17] our only place of shelter
[2:01:20] our only hiding place
[2:01:23] and in him
[2:01:25] we find our being and our strength
[2:01:29] keep applying the token praise be to
[2:01:32] love
[2:01:34] praise be to the Lord
[2:01:37] thank you Jesus
[2:01:40] praise be to God
[2:01:42] I will cover the one brother one if you
[2:01:45] can take over
[2:01:47] God bless you science
[2:02:19] see the boys
[2:02:42] yes I will pass I will pass over
[2:02:49] you
[2:02:54] Josh man is coming
[2:03:00] will be there
[2:03:03] each one received just
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:16] in the city increase in Blood
[2:03:23] and our good past
[2:03:27] my soul for you oh
[2:03:41] foreign
[2:04:01] [Applause]
[2:04:18] foreign
[2:04:26] [Music]
[2:04:40] [Applause]
[2:04:46] foreign
[2:04:56] we
[2:04:58] know that every time when God
[2:05:03] allow the world to comfort there's a
[2:05:05] purpose
[2:05:06] that the word comes for
[2:05:09] you know better brand him talking about
[2:05:11] three minutes to midnight
[2:05:13] every time the prophet made our
[2:05:15] statement he ties into uh to the Jews
[2:05:21] and he ties it to the Jews timeline he
[2:05:24] ties it to the Jews returning back to
[2:05:27] their Homeland he ties into the prophecy
[2:05:30] concerning the Jews and and all of that
[2:05:33] but you also realize that
[2:05:37] in Revelation chapter 10
[2:05:41] are the sounding of of the last
[2:05:45] messenger
[2:05:46] uh the scripture says time will be
[2:05:48] normal
[2:05:49] time is normal and when brother Branham
[2:05:52] talks about that is the time he says
[2:05:55] that uh the sounding of that messenger
[2:05:59] you know or uh uh put the end of time to
[2:06:04] the worst system
[2:06:06] you know and and that's the reason why
[2:06:08] it looks like uh you know politics have
[2:06:11] come to its end you know that we see the
[2:06:15] the church system has come to his end
[2:06:18] and all of that and that's the reason
[2:06:20] why God has to call us out with a
[2:06:23] message so uh we know that that that
[2:06:26] face the Jews timeline for for our
[2:06:29] timeline we realize that the message has
[2:06:32] called us out of La audition praise the
[2:06:34] Lord so uh we're uh uh but I would say
[2:06:38] that you know every time like just like
[2:06:41] I said when when the message comes like
[2:06:44] this is is is for the church is for an
[2:06:48] individual
[2:06:49] to take you know examine their life
[2:06:53] I've been kind of for studying a little
[2:06:55] bit in the book of
[2:06:57] Leviticus
[2:06:59] you know every time we
[2:07:02] we start reading a book at home I take a
[2:07:06] time to go back and start studying the
[2:07:08] book
[2:07:09] and what I realized uh just in life with
[2:07:13] what what I feel that that the Lord was
[2:07:16] speaking through brother Dan tonight
[2:07:18] instead in The Book of Leviticus
[2:07:22] and looking at uh some of the the
[2:07:26] subject there in the book
[2:07:29] The Book of Leviticus turned out to be
[2:07:32] one of the
[2:07:35] a very striking book
[2:07:38] because it's a book that has a sense to
[2:07:42] deal with the church
[2:07:44] it's called The Book of the call
[2:07:48] you know it's it's one of the book where
[2:07:50] God spoke to Moses
[2:07:53] directly from the Tabernacle
[2:07:56] and is calling the people
[2:07:59] to a life of separation
[2:08:02] with all the ordinances all the feasts
[2:08:06] it is with you know uh the uncleanness
[2:08:11] and everything
[2:08:13] and then uh listening to what brother
[2:08:15] Dan preached tonight
[2:08:19] what I hear the spirit saying to the
[2:08:22] church is uh
[2:08:24] uh
[2:08:26] you know we
[2:08:27] we have to uh
[2:08:30] somehow examine ourselves we know that
[2:08:33] uh like we always says the worship part
[2:08:35] is never on an examination
[2:08:38] but we have to take a very close
[2:08:40] look at our life just like where we were
[2:08:43] trying to encourage the church on on
[2:08:45] Sunday
[2:08:47] and uh
[2:08:49] uh
[2:08:50] this message have called us to a higher
[2:08:54] calling we are a Rapture people
[2:08:57] praise the Lord where people that has
[2:09:00] been called out of the worst system you
[2:09:03] know out of out of uh you know the
[2:09:06] loudisha age and uh we know we have to
[2:09:09] go to work we have to go to school you
[2:09:12] know we go to the same Grocery Center
[2:09:14] the same hospital we deal with the same
[2:09:17] things but we realize that we have been
[2:09:20] called to to uh to go into the holiest
[2:09:25] of holy with the Lord
[2:09:26] you know we are called to a life of
[2:09:29] communion you know a life of of
[2:09:33] dedication
[2:09:34] uh you know a life that is separated
[2:09:38] from uh you know from the things of the
[2:09:41] world and as I was just looking into
[2:09:44] into that and sharing some of the few
[2:09:46] things at home with the family
[2:09:48] and uh and seeing where we are you know
[2:09:52] uh uh any any day now like our brother
[2:09:56] said we can be stepping on the shows of
[2:09:59] glory and all of that but it's also at a
[2:10:02] place where you know God wants us as his
[2:10:06] children with everything that we have to
[2:10:08] deal with to come to a you know a life
[2:10:10] of of confidence you know we have
[2:10:13] confidence we know where we are we know
[2:10:15] where we are standing with the Lord you
[2:10:17] know what I mean if there is things in
[2:10:20] our lives and you know that are blocking
[2:10:22] us we we must deal with it you know
[2:10:24] while we we must we must trash those
[2:10:27] things away you know we must have time
[2:10:29] to spend with the Lord our communion
[2:10:31] with the Lord our devotion with the Lord
[2:10:33] when we step out of our homes we know we
[2:10:36] are stepping out in faith you know when
[2:10:39] we come back to the house and if yes if
[2:10:41] we have a situation at home we must deal
[2:10:44] with either calling to the word if
[2:10:46] there's a situation with a brother we
[2:10:48] must deal with it according to the word
[2:10:49] if there's a situation in church we must
[2:10:52] deal with it calling to the word it's a
[2:10:54] place where the uh this bride this
[2:10:57] rapturing bride is standing with so much
[2:10:59] confidence we know where we are standing
[2:11:01] you know what we know where we are with
[2:11:04] the Lord so let's just buy our house
[2:11:06] tonight let's just buy our house tonight
[2:11:11] as uh as uh the message of our brother
[2:11:15] you know is
[2:11:17] bringing us to the place to realize uh
[2:11:21] is later than we think that's what we
[2:11:24] can say you know three minutes to
[2:11:26] midnight means that it's later than we
[2:11:29] think
[2:11:30] it is not it is not time to put off
[2:11:32] things you know we must not put up what
[2:11:35] we can do today for tomorrow
