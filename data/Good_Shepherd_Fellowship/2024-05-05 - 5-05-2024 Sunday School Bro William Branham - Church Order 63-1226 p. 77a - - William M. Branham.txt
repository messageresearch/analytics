[Music] d [Music] church we have tried to go accordingly to the way we understand the orders given in the dedication of the new church and by doing so some have gotten mad and left the church and others will not listen to anything we say especially the children we have talk to the parents about their children and they won't take care of them now have we misunderstood or are we going about it in the wrong way thanks now let me answer this as they come down um and and respect to the order of the church we have tried to go accordingly to the way we understood at given in the dedication of the new church now that's correct you're doing right now this is supposed to be deacons I suppose because it's right here it's a Deacon's job all right and by doing so we have often people has often gotten mad at us they do at me too they'll do it any man see a person that does that there's something wrong with that person they're not right with God for the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ teaching Christ house Christ order and any man that or any woman or any person's children that would get angry with a Godly Deacon that would tell them to be or any parent would get angry with the Deacon really we want everybody in this church that we can get but if that would only cause trouble somewhere else there's a thought or rabbit in the woodpile as we used to say it that person isn't right if they leave there's only one thing to do let them go and pray for them then maybe some of the deacons go to the church or go to the house sometime and find out why they left and ask them what was wrong then and if they see if he can reconcile him if he can't then take two or three Witnesses with him that they might be understood then if he can't be understood then it's told before the church if they are a member here of the church then they are and then if they're not members of the Church of course they're not members of this congregation they should be made to to be rued see they they've got to listen to our orders here because this is the orders of the church this is things we don't want to do things that I don't like to do but it's things that must be do and I'm exposing myself and tell them here but this tape it's me they can hear me talking and know that's me not you man you've asked me these questions and I'm giving it to you the best that I know how from the word of God now if those people get angry go out from you what is the scripture say about it brother Braham they went out from us because they wasn't of us that settles it left the church that's what they did all right others will not listen to anything we say especially the children the children are supposed to know discipline they should get it at home but even if it's mine my kids getting here anytime they get this already I don't want you to draw One String Sarah Rebecca Joseph Billy or whoever it might be you tell me I'll see to it if they can't behave then they'll stay away from church till they do learn to behave this is not an arena this is a house of God this is not a place to play and skate and write notes and laugh and cut up this is the house of God is be carried out Godly you come here to worship not even to visit this is not a this is not a picnic ground this not a visitation place this is the visitation place of the holy spirit this L to what he has to say not to one another we don't come here to Fellowship uh with one another we come here to fellowship with Christ This is a house of worship and children must be disciplined and if they are of the parents let it be known if these deacons if these parents of the children will not listen to what these deacons said then this parents should be corrected themselves we have talked to the parent parents about the children and they won't take care of them if they are members of this church then you should take two or three with you and call that parent into a private meeting into one of the offices I don't care who it is if it's me if it's brother Neville it's Billy Paul and his little boy if it's brother Collins and one of his children or any rest of you we're we love one another but we're Duty bound to God in this word it's D but no matter who it is we're to call one another in and be honest with one another how can God ever deal with us if we're not honest with one another how are we going to be honest with him see this is an order we must keep the house of God and deacons are supposed to know how to do that and that's why I'm telling you now I keep them things call them and if this you tell the parents and they won't listen to the won't listen to it then you get you another Deacon or one of the trustees or some good person in this church and call take your trust take your Deacon boore all your deacons together say brother Jones brother Henderson brother Jackson or whoever it might be see their children are disbehaving we've told them two three times about these children and they won't listen to it then call Brother Jones and or brother whoever it is and say brother Jones We've called you in here for a meeting we love you and you're a part of us you're one of us let me just sit in a certain tape and listen to what brother brandom said about it see now we've asked you to make the those children behave see if they won't behave and you can't make them behave in church leave them with someone while you come to church until they learn how to behave thems in the house of God but this is an order it's got to be carried out see now other question goes on now have we misunderstood no sir you haven't misunderstood that's correct I'm saying it again the orders in the army they don't ask you will you go do a certain thing if you're in the Army you're compelled to do it see and that's the way it is in the I'm compelled to preach the gospel I'm compelled to stand for this regardless of what my other man and Brethren and so forth say about I'm compelled to do this I have to hurt feelings and cut man to Pieces but if I you don't want to get like oswal see if you can't disagree with a man in things then shake his hand and still have the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you if I can't disagree agree with a man bitterly from one side to the other and still think as much of him as as Christ would and there's something wrong with my spirit I haven't the spirit of Christ if he says well brother brandom I believe that you are teaching is this all right brother let's come together to reason you and I we'll take it ourselves we'll go over here in the room to ourselves we'll reason it out and he just cuts me to pieces now I have to say things back to him if in my heart I can't feel the same about him and he's still my brother and I'm trying to help him then I'll never help him there's no way for me to help him if I don't love him what's Ed of going over there telling in first place first brother I don't love you and let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because I can't help you until I love you and that's right and that's the way see car on you've done it exactly right that's the way it should be you never misunderstood are we going about the wrong way no it is the right way they carry that let order be kept because it's constantly uh Little Children mothers little babies and things they they'll cry and if they get crying too much and interrupting your pastor up there remember you are his bodyguards you're his gospel bodyguards see and if it's interrupting the message of the Lord then you are deacons what are you to do just like men speaking in tongues he's Duty bound and a man preaching he's Duty bound to the word he's Duty bound to these things each one of you is Duty bound to an office and that's just what we're uh we're here to do now we don't want to wait too long and I know I got an appointment a few minutes so I'll I'll just try to hurry as quick as I can brother Brenham there's three two questions on this card here brother brand what should be the policy of taking up offerings in the church for people how should this be done I think taking up offerings in the church for people should not be done unless it's for your pastor and I think if someone comes in for charity or something like that that or someone in in bad need like one of our members here a congregation say have one of our brothers and uh they have some trouble well I think then that should be announced at the platform and let the pastor do that I think it's his duty to do that some brother that's in need of something let him present it to the church if it wants to be taken that way if it's someone in need and um and then uh you don't want to take the offering up far the person that's in need then let the boards meet together and agree upon certain sums that they want to give to this person out of the treasury but the treasur is low at that time and they can't afford to do it then it has to be taken up well let let the let it be talked with the board given orders to the pastor and let the pastor ask for this certain thing said tonight our brother Jones he had a a horrible accident his house burned down and tonight as Christians we're going together to each one of us make a pledge of what we can do to help brother Jones back with his house again see or or whatever it is see we do that let that be said from the platform that's the way to do that and then let the pledges be given and then give it over to The Treasure of the church and these pledges be paid to The Treasure of the church and give to them and and give the person a receipt for it because I don't know where that's tax redemption or not I guess it is for something like that now but when it comes to like a a stranger come in a stranger come in like the man comes in said well you know what I um I I'm on a journey and uh I blow out a tire and I want a new tire take me up offering tonight for a new tire now that shouldn't be done no that should not be done and if it seems to if it seems to be a worthy thing of somebody that you know the board could meet and designate a certain amount of money from the treasure to buy that manatar or whatever it was or either if the church treasur is low and it's decided by the board uh that these the pastor shouldn't have nothing to do in this the the deacons is forced to do this are the boards and now if this um if it's agreed not give to the pastor the pastor can take the offering but notice [Music] if it's a stranger it's in an emergency a fell needs a little money and you feel it it's for a just cause uh this is my opinion if it's for a real just cause and you know it is for a just C now first if you go up there and look on my books at the house of people coming by say I'm Reverend so and so from this certain certain church and I I had some trouble down the road here and I I need need a set of tars and know I just come in from a meeting and had an offering or something like that I give it to them really to go get a set of tars and look in the minutes there no was such a minister is that never lived in such a place and there's 10 or $20,000 on the books from these years I've give out like that never know nothing about him worthy was come to find out other ministers say well he made me for so and so and so and so now the church is not responsible only for their own that's right their own they're responsible but if it seems to be a worth calls and then if you the if you trustees might say well now wait a minute this man there is his car down there this is to happen and this it's not of our congregation see but it is then if they want to do it like that and would say something special about an outsider not our own now see not our own people our own people be taken up right here amongst their their own their brothers here see but if it's somebody on the outside and the fellow says he's hungry or and somebody wants to reach down his pocket and give him charity that's up to you but I'm talking about from the church and then if the church people are asked to donate then now if you got an evangelist of course in he preaching then you take you that's understood before he comes you know that you'll give him offering or pay him salary or whatever he wants to do but then if this person is here it's for a just cause and the pastor and the board would want to agree and tell the pastor app on it they let the pastor say a certain certain person is sitting here we don't know the man he come in and he ask us for he says his children are hungry we haven't got the time we haven't had the time to investigate the the the the claim see if there's anything like that that are or if there's anything among our own our our own deacons go investigate those claims see then if it's worthy then do it if it isn't worthy don't do it don't have to but now if it's a man here and you you let the pastor say now the trustee board told me they did not know this person but the man is sitting here he says his name is Jim Jones or whatever it might be and he's sitting right here would you stand up Mr Jones now Mr Jones at the end of the service you stand just at the back door there as you go out and if any people feel in your heart or anything that you want to do for this man give it to him as you go out is that understood now did you get that on yours uh to those who are on the tape and uh one of the brother Collins missed it on his tape I want to uh reinstate that the quotation again if uh because he's one of the deacons if uh if there be any other one man comes in that you and is in emergency and he wants an offering from the church let the trustees or deacons meet together and um let the meet together and make this decision then tell the pastor it might be done like this let them let the pastors say that this certain man call him by name we know him not and our policy here is to in investigate before we take offerings for people and that is of our own but this man here he says he's broke down he's had emergency he's got sick children he trying to get medicine for his children or whatever it might be the emergency now he's standing right here would you stand up Sir see and let him stand up and say now you people see what who he is now at the close of this service this man shall stand there at the front door and people going out that feel that you want to contribute to this you're at liberty we only announced it in the church you're not sanctioning it you're only announcing it see that's Hospitality to a stranger see understand now all right I think that settles that question what about
