[1:00:17] but you you realize that
[1:00:20] uh
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:22] you know when when uh when when these
[1:00:24] things are happening all of these global
[1:00:27] stain god never left us without a
[1:00:30] witness amen
[1:00:31] he gave us his word
[1:00:33] you know he gave us his word i'm hoping
[1:00:36] that uh
[1:00:37] sometime
[1:00:38] soon in the summer year i might take a
[1:00:41] little time and talk
[1:00:42] on the seals a little bit
[1:00:45] you know just to give
[1:00:47] a kind of for uh
[1:00:50] uh
[1:00:51] you know primary approach to the seals
[1:00:55] because you see all of these things that
[1:00:57] are happening the the worst situation we
[1:00:59] we just
[1:01:01] deal with coronavirus and different
[1:01:03] things that are happening around the
[1:01:05] world
[1:01:07] uh
[1:01:09] you know uh
[1:01:10] the word of god spoke about them
[1:01:13] you know they are mad they are not
[1:01:15] things
[1:01:16] that is taking god by surprise and they
[1:01:19] must not fake god's children by surprise
[1:01:23] praise the lord
[1:01:24] so i just i just thought i was uh
[1:01:27] fellowshipping with brother ajar this
[1:01:28] weekend and uh
[1:01:31] because i had him helping me in what i
[1:01:33] wanted to do
[1:01:34] so and then we started talking about you
[1:01:37] know global events and different things
[1:01:39] and and so i just want to share this
[1:01:41] with you
[1:01:42] and then we will turn the service over
[1:01:44] for our brother to come and minister to
[1:01:46] us
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:49] and this is from the first seal
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:57] i never told the folks back there that
[1:01:59] they sent it to them i don't know if i
[1:02:01] did but
[1:02:03] i would just go right ahead
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:10] now we realized that
[1:02:13] when you when you get to
[1:02:15] to dealing with the skills
[1:02:17] and getting to dealing with uh you know
[1:02:20] things that are happening i just i just
[1:02:21] want to for just to bring this to you
[1:02:24] now a trumpet always denote wall
[1:02:28] or otherwise political disturbance
[1:02:32] a trumpet does
[1:02:34] a political disturbance
[1:02:37] now and that's word uh i want to
[1:02:42] to be able to grab our attention as we
[1:02:45] think on these things because sometimes
[1:02:48] it's it's easy for us to get into uh you
[1:02:51] know all the
[1:02:53] the the comments that comes through the
[1:02:55] news and comes through the media
[1:02:58] and uh and and all of that
[1:03:02] but
[1:03:04] we have to know that
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:10] whenever we are dealing with uh
[1:03:14] uh a major political disturbance
[1:03:21] it is always
[1:03:24] uh
[1:03:27] a message it's always through the
[1:03:30] scripture through the entire bible
[1:03:33] it is always the way that god
[1:03:37] has did
[1:03:39] with
[1:03:40] israel his people
[1:03:44] praise the lord
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] now
[1:03:50] when when jacob
[1:03:53] was to leave the house of lebanon
[1:03:56] we know he was not a nation at that time
[1:04:01] praise the lord
[1:04:02] he was not a nation at that time
[1:04:05] that was just a household or that was
[1:04:07] just uh
[1:04:09] a young man starting his life
[1:04:12] and but we will see with what happened
[1:04:15] in egypt
[1:04:16] all of the the the plagues that were
[1:04:19] coming in egypt
[1:04:21] they were all political disturbance
[1:04:24] amen a trouble it troubled the
[1:04:28] the
[1:04:29] uh the rulership of of the pharaoh you
[1:04:32] know what that was that was that was
[1:04:34] ruling that time
[1:04:36] you know because it makes his government
[1:04:38] to look weak
[1:04:39] because egypt was a superpower
[1:04:43] and
[1:04:45] so i i just wanted to just uh
[1:04:48] point this out to us
[1:04:49] you know just remind us i know we know
[1:04:52] these things
[1:04:53] you know a trumpet always denote wall or
[1:04:56] otherwise political disturbance a
[1:04:58] trumpet does political disturbance and
[1:05:02] that causes war
[1:05:05] when you go to get uh missing in
[1:05:08] politics
[1:05:09] you get them all you get them all messed
[1:05:12] up
[1:05:13] like we got it now
[1:05:17] look out walls at hand but see
[1:05:21] the kingdom still belongs to satan
[1:05:25] he still got his part
[1:05:27] in his hand because one
[1:05:30] it is redeemed by christ but he is doing
[1:05:33] a part of the kingsmen redeemer taking
[1:05:36] his subject
[1:05:39] until the last name is put on the book
[1:05:44] has already received
[1:05:46] and been sealed
[1:05:48] away praise the lord
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:54] now so we see that uh
[1:05:57] uh
[1:05:58] we've been taught
[1:06:00] that uh
[1:06:02] when you want to know the time of the
[1:06:03] day look at the clock if you want to
[1:06:06] know the time you know that that we are
[1:06:08] in
[1:06:09] look at israel
[1:06:11] praise the lord because we know that uh
[1:06:14] you know this is it's god's people
[1:06:16] and i mean there's there's no way you
[1:06:18] can fight against that because the very
[1:06:20] bible that we read is is filled with uh
[1:06:23] with uh jewish
[1:06:24] traditions
[1:06:26] you know in in jewish history that's
[1:06:28] that's that's where our faith is all
[1:06:30] surrounding you know uh
[1:06:33] the father abraham and the patriots
[1:06:36] now so
[1:06:37] uh
[1:06:38] uh in one sense here you know brother
[1:06:41] branham year teaching the seals and and
[1:06:43] those things that we heard from the
[1:06:46] foundation of the world is bringing us
[1:06:48] an understanding is because that is the
[1:06:51] way that god have always used to gather
[1:06:55] his people back to their homeland
[1:07:02] praise the lord
[1:07:03] amen
[1:07:05] and uh uh
[1:07:07] i mean god had to uh uh shake an entire
[1:07:10] ship because he wanted to get one man
[1:07:12] off the ship that was jonah
[1:07:14] you know and and and god can can be able
[1:07:17] to put an entire nation under pressure
[1:07:20] just to be able to get one illegal back
[1:07:23] to the world
[1:07:24] an entire family can go through trial
[1:07:26] because god just want to shake one son
[1:07:29] back into his place
[1:07:33] you know and and then so brother branham
[1:07:35] goes down here and he says but
[1:07:38] trump denotes political disturbance
[1:07:41] whereas seal
[1:07:43] these
[1:07:44] waves
[1:07:46] a religious
[1:07:49] disturbance
[1:07:52] praise the lord
[1:07:53] and the religious disturbance have to
[1:07:57] deal with
[1:07:58] god dealing with his elected people
[1:08:04] praise the lord
[1:08:06] god dealing with his elected people
[1:08:08] that's the reason why when we see state
[1:08:11] and church merging together and we see
[1:08:14] uh
[1:08:15] you know the nation taking stand on the
[1:08:18] churches we know that is speaking to us
[1:08:21] directly as illegal
[1:08:26] are we together
[1:08:28] and uh uh i mean uh what a we know that
[1:08:32] on that but uh uh
[1:08:35] russia i mean
[1:08:36] ukraine state house
[1:08:38] a lot of jews
[1:08:41] even the ukraine president is a jew
[1:08:47] you know i'm not putting no
[1:08:49] interpretation to it
[1:08:51] because i'm not a politician i'm just a
[1:08:53] preacher
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:56] but i'm just trying to
[1:08:59] to help us to be able to see that
[1:09:02] there is not an even on the earth that
[1:09:06] god's word
[1:09:09] never photo off
[1:09:16] praise the lord
[1:09:20] whereas i see you deals with religious
[1:09:23] discipline see a seal is open a message
[1:09:26] is dropped
[1:09:28] and then the church
[1:09:31] is always so
[1:09:33] set up
[1:09:35] in its own political way
[1:09:39] and whatever more in all of its
[1:09:42] dignitaries and when the real message
[1:09:45] dropped down
[1:09:47] that messenger goes forth
[1:09:50] and he shake them to pieces we saw what
[1:09:53] happened under the reformation
[1:09:57] you know
[1:09:58] john uh
[1:09:59] luther
[1:10:00] brought out a message of justification
[1:10:03] is it it shook the whole place because
[1:10:05] at that time the state had a grip on the
[1:10:09] church
[1:10:14] praise the lord
[1:10:17] so uh uh
[1:10:19] but we will trust the lord we will trust
[1:10:21] that he would give us grace
[1:10:23] and uh will find time to be able to
[1:10:26] to uh
[1:10:28] review these things as you have already
[1:10:31] known them
[1:10:32] we'll go over them and then we can be
[1:10:34] able to fellowship around it praise the
[1:10:36] lord
[1:10:37] you know that message goes for
[1:10:40] shake them to pieces that's right
[1:10:42] is religious disturbing when
[1:10:45] a seal
[1:10:47] open
[1:10:49] just like how it happens to the
[1:10:52] religious world
[1:10:54] that is the same way it happened to
[1:10:56] a believer
[1:10:58] when you have a better understanding of
[1:11:01] the word you get into a religious world
[1:11:05] why because every devil in hell come
[1:11:08] against that revelation that you have
[1:11:10] received
[1:11:11] because uh
[1:11:13] satan knows that's where your true
[1:11:15] identity is he knows that's where your
[1:11:18] power is
[1:11:20] amen he's it does not bother him if you
[1:11:22] just want to come warm up the benches in
[1:11:25] church you know dance to the music and
[1:11:28] go home it does not bother him
[1:11:30] but when you want to be a son of god and
[1:11:32] the daughter of god to be able to
[1:11:33] identify yourself in this book all hell
[1:11:36] rise against you
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:46] praise the lord so we will just we just
[1:11:48] continue to pray for the believers and
[1:11:51] the saints
[1:11:52] there
[1:11:53] uh in in that area
[1:11:55] and uh pray that the law would just
[1:11:58] protect his children you know just guide
[1:12:00] them
[1:12:01] and uh
[1:12:02] you know guide them in truth
[1:12:05] and and just keep them together give
[1:12:07] them faith for whatever is going on

[1:16:45] into it and they are saved
[1:16:48] but there's something i take great
[1:16:50] confidence in
[1:16:52] is i don't have to trust in my own
[1:16:54] righteousness to be verified to run into
[1:16:57] the tower
[1:16:58] all i have to do is verify his
[1:17:00] righteousness and it's applied to me by
[1:17:03] the blood and when i see that blood
[1:17:05] applied i know the righteousness is
[1:17:07] applied i can run into that tower for
[1:17:09] safety
[1:17:10] you see because
[1:17:12] times like they are today even more than
[1:17:15] ever before
[1:17:16] show us why we need a tower to run into
[1:17:19] for safety
[1:17:20] not a man-made tower
[1:17:22] because no matter what kind of a tower
[1:17:24] you would make today
[1:17:27] you could stock it up for the next 10 15
[1:17:29] years when you walk out there'll be
[1:17:30] another war there'll be another disease
[1:17:33] there'll be something waiting for you
[1:17:36] you won't escape it
[1:17:37] but if you can run into that tower
[1:17:40] that is under his name
[1:17:42] under the wings of the eagle
[1:17:45] where he'll take and cover you
[1:17:47] then nothing will touch you there
[1:17:50] and
[1:17:51] that's just such a wonderful thing
[1:17:53] that's just such a wonderful thing
[1:17:59] let's just go ahead and we're going to
[1:18:01] jump right in i
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:05] never do real well with a whole lot of
[1:18:06] pleasantries beforehand it doesn't help
[1:18:09] my nerves any thank you musicians so if
[1:18:12] we'll just turn to thessalonians
[1:18:15] um
[1:18:16] first thessalonians 5
[1:18:19] and we're going to read verses 19
[1:18:21] through 23
[1:18:23] and i'll let you everyone be seated so i
[1:18:26] start talking after i'm done reading
[1:18:28] just go ahead and sit down
[1:18:30] just in case
[1:18:32] if you're there to say amen
[1:18:35] it says quench not the spirit
[1:18:38] despise not prophesying
[1:18:41] prove all things hold fast that which is
[1:18:44] good
[1:18:45] abstain
[1:18:47] from all appearance of evil
[1:18:50] and the very god of
[1:18:52] peace sanctify you holy
[1:18:56] and i pray god your whole spirit and
[1:18:59] soul
[1:19:00] and body be preserved blameless
[1:19:03] unto the coming
[1:19:05] of our lord jesus christ let's just pray
[1:19:08] heavenly father lord we just come before
[1:19:10] you once again this morning father
[1:19:12] feeling so blessed just to be here in
[1:19:15] your presence father and we can be so
[1:19:17] confident of that lord not just because
[1:19:18] we feel it father because we don't base
[1:19:21] everything off of feelings father well
[1:19:23] we can know it because it's a promise of
[1:19:25] your word that you said wherever two or
[1:19:27] three are gathered together in my name
[1:19:29] lord there's more than two or three so
[1:19:32] we don't even have to take a head count
[1:19:34] this morning to see if we can verify
[1:19:36] that father we can just look and see we
[1:19:38] know
[1:19:39] your children are here gathered in your
[1:19:40] name and if they're here gathered in
[1:19:42] your name then you're here also father
[1:19:45] lord we just pray you'd come down and
[1:19:46] take full control this service father
[1:19:49] lord
[1:19:50] take control of my lips and
[1:19:52] lord my thoughts my
[1:19:54] everything i surrender to you
[1:19:57] lord that you would come and speak a
[1:19:58] word to your people lord straight from
[1:20:01] your lips to their ears and their hearts
[1:20:03] father lord that you would come and
[1:20:05] anoint the heart of the hearer father
[1:20:08] lord and
[1:20:10] raise up their faith father to hear from
[1:20:12] you
[1:20:13] lord we just surrender all these things
[1:20:15] into your hands in the wonderful name of
[1:20:17] our lord and savior jesus christ we pray
[1:20:20] amen you may be seated
[1:20:23] this morning out of that reading i want
[1:20:25] to
[1:20:26] focus a little bit on
[1:20:28] verse 22 and it says abstain from all
[1:20:32] appearance of evil
[1:20:34] and i'm going to take a little bit
[1:20:35] different view off of this and that word
[1:20:38] appearance we always
[1:20:40] kind of look at it as
[1:20:42] you know anything that would even
[1:20:45] in any way
[1:20:47] look to be like something
[1:20:49] but if you take and that's true we
[1:20:52] always want to i'm not taking away from
[1:20:53] the fact that we would even want to
[1:20:56] abstain from something that would appear
[1:20:57] to be evil because we're a
[1:20:59] representation of christ
[1:21:01] so at any time we wouldn't want to enter
[1:21:03] into something that would bring shame on
[1:21:06] his name
[1:21:07] but this is also the the translation
[1:21:10] that a word appearance means form
[1:21:13] if same from all forms of evil
[1:21:16] and truly if we we were abstaining from
[1:21:18] all forms anything that would take on
[1:21:21] that form then we would
[1:21:23] also
[1:21:25] abstain from all
[1:21:26] appearances but just something to think
[1:21:29] about it it gives it kind of more of a
[1:21:31] more body more shape because appearance
[1:21:33] you know appearance is
[1:21:35] from for one people one person to the
[1:21:37] next what if something appears like can
[1:21:39] be very different
[1:21:41] a lot of times it's based on what you
[1:21:42] know how close you are to the situation
[1:21:46] there's a lot of factors there and what
[1:21:48] i see with my eyes or what i thought i
[1:21:51] saw with my eyes
[1:21:52] may not be what was true altogether
[1:21:55] and that's how
[1:21:56] you know that's how the good old gossip
[1:21:58] mill gets going
[1:22:00] is because i saw something that appeared
[1:22:02] to me
[1:22:03] to be something wrong or something evil
[1:22:06] and instead of going into that person
[1:22:07] and verifying that or following up and
[1:22:10] and confirming that i just run off and
[1:22:13] share that with
[1:22:14] everyone i think who will
[1:22:16] want want to hear it
[1:22:18] and it'll provide me with a little bit
[1:22:19] of status if i if i share that
[1:22:22] you know and that's a lot of the problem
[1:22:24] and so it's good to have
[1:22:27] something maybe a little bit more
[1:22:28] concrete
[1:22:30] right because it also gives us there's
[1:22:31] something to shoot at if something is
[1:22:32] too abstract you don't know what you're
[1:22:34] trying to do
[1:22:36] you know it's good when when you go to
[1:22:38] work or you're given a project
[1:22:40] you know they'll give you an abstract
[1:22:42] before you get started but once you get
[1:22:44] going they'll give you exact goals
[1:22:46] because the abstract is too big it's too
[1:22:48] broad you know anyways
[1:22:51] just moving on i i'm actually looking to
[1:22:54] take a look at
[1:22:56] there is
[1:22:57] here we've been if you've been here for
[1:22:59] sunday school or you've been following
[1:23:01] the sunday school
[1:23:03] portion of the service prior on sunday
[1:23:05] mornings we've been listening to the
[1:23:07] church age book that brother branham
[1:23:09] wrote
[1:23:10] and
[1:23:11] i don't remember i believe it was last
[1:23:13] sunday we were listening to a portion of
[1:23:15] the sardisian church age
[1:23:18] and something really struck me
[1:23:20] and it was i just thank the lord for it
[1:23:22] because a lot of times i'm
[1:23:24] i'm actively working even when i'm here
[1:23:26] and a lot of times you miss things even
[1:23:28] though you're hearing them
[1:23:30] but
[1:23:31] um
[1:23:32] there was a portion of it and it's
[1:23:35] i don't have the it's the beginning of
[1:23:36] the sardisian church age and i'm
[1:23:38] actually i've highlighted this a small
[1:23:40] portion of it let me read the whole
[1:23:42] paragraph it's a little long but i think
[1:23:44] it'll be good
[1:23:46] it says
[1:23:47] you know we are living in the end time
[1:23:49] it is in this age that churches are
[1:23:51] going to come together
[1:23:53] and as they are even now controlling
[1:23:55] world politics
[1:23:56] they will soon control the finances of
[1:23:58] the world
[1:23:59] then if you don't belong to the world
[1:24:01] organization of churches you won't be
[1:24:03] able to buy or to sell
[1:24:06] you will lose all
[1:24:07] those who stay true to god and keep
[1:24:09] their garments clean from defilement of
[1:24:12] this world system
[1:24:14] of church orders will be physically
[1:24:17] bereft
[1:24:18] there will be present to them a great
[1:24:20] temptation to give in
[1:24:22] preachers will give in with the excuse
[1:24:24] that they will serve god within the
[1:24:26] framework of the antichrist be system
[1:24:29] they will give in to the flatteries and
[1:24:31] the blandishments of the hierarchy
[1:24:34] and the people will follow those false
[1:24:36] shepherds right into the slaughter
[1:24:38] but in the judgment they will all be
[1:24:41] found naked
[1:24:42] they will not be given those white robes
[1:24:44] neither will they walk with him
[1:24:46] you can't walk in spotted garments of
[1:24:48] the world holding hands with the devil
[1:24:51] hear and then expect to be with god now
[1:24:54] here's the part i would like to focus on
[1:24:57] it is time to wake up
[1:24:59] and hear the voice of god crying come
[1:25:01] out of her
[1:25:03] organized religion my people that ye be
[1:25:06] not partakers of her sins
[1:25:08] that you receive not of her plagues amen
[1:25:13] god is speaking shun the religions of
[1:25:16] this world like you shun the plague
[1:25:19] leave off walking with the world make
[1:25:21] your garments white by repentance and
[1:25:24] the blood of the lamb but do it now for
[1:25:27] tomorrow may be too late you know and
[1:25:30] that is actually the portion that struck
[1:25:32] me
[1:25:34] extremely hard
[1:25:36] is that you know a lot of times
[1:25:40] you hear things you know things let's
[1:25:43] say in school you study things
[1:25:45] but it's all theory until you put it
[1:25:48] into practice
[1:25:49] and i think a lot of times there's
[1:25:51] things that are in scripture things that
[1:25:53] are ministered
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:56] they're really
[1:25:58] for many of us nice theories
[1:26:01] they're nice stories because we've never
[1:26:03] experienced it
[1:26:05] we we think we know what it means we
[1:26:08] know we think we know the application
[1:26:10] but there's a difference between knowing
[1:26:12] the textbook version of something
[1:26:15] and then actually applying it to your
[1:26:17] life
[1:26:18] and every aspect of your life
[1:26:20] there's always the textbook version and
[1:26:22] then you get there and you go into
[1:26:23] training and they're like yeah that's
[1:26:25] what the textbook says
[1:26:26] what
[1:26:28] what we like to say i don't know how
[1:26:30] many of you know but i'm in in
[1:26:31] laboratory science and there's a lot of
[1:26:34] diseases and and my in microbiology that
[1:26:37] they will tell you this is what the
[1:26:39] textbook says that does
[1:26:41] but always remember it doesn't read the
[1:26:43] textbook
[1:26:47] you know and but this struck me because
[1:26:49] i thought wow here is a statement
[1:26:53] that right now in this present day
[1:26:55] there's not a person in the world that
[1:26:57] can't identify with it
[1:27:00] it says shun the religions of this world
[1:27:02] like you shun the plague and that's the
[1:27:05] title of what i
[1:27:06] want to speak on this morning is i want
[1:27:08] to speak on the pandemic we have become
[1:27:11] complacent with
[1:27:15] you see because i want to take a look
[1:27:17] and i'm going to touch just a little bit
[1:27:19] on some of the physical applications
[1:27:21] that we have all experienced in the last
[1:27:23] couple of years in regards to a plague
[1:27:26] or a pandemic
[1:27:28] a plague on this earth
[1:27:30] you know we see when it first was coming
[1:27:32] on there was that beginning of 2020
[1:27:35] and you hear things coming out and um
[1:27:39] no one's really sure what's going on or
[1:27:40] where it's going or what to do
[1:27:43] and at first people
[1:27:44] they blow it off as it's nothing
[1:27:47] and then as it begins to spread people
[1:27:49] become more concerned
[1:27:51] but the people who are the most
[1:27:52] concerned are the people it's currently
[1:27:54] affecting
[1:27:56] and most people don't get really
[1:27:58] concerned until it starts affecting
[1:27:59] people around them
[1:28:02] and then as it spreads and spreads and
[1:28:04] spreads people become more concerned
[1:28:06] they all start looking for answers
[1:28:08] right
[1:28:09] and they all start looking to people who
[1:28:11] can give them answers
[1:28:13] and they become very disillusioned if
[1:28:16] those answers aren't what they want to
[1:28:17] hear
[1:28:18] if they if
[1:28:20] people don't seem to have all the right
[1:28:22] answers
[1:28:24] they're willing but they're willing to
[1:28:25] try anything
[1:28:27] the beginning they're willing to try
[1:28:29] anything
[1:28:30] if even if it has the slightest chance
[1:28:33] or hope of helping them or protecting
[1:28:35] them or keeping them from something
[1:28:37] and you see people on all different
[1:28:39] layout level uh
[1:28:41] levels the people who
[1:28:43] run and hide in their house forever they
[1:28:45] stock up they're never coming out
[1:28:48] right
[1:28:49] and then you have those people who blow
[1:28:50] it off and this is it's nothing
[1:28:52] right
[1:28:53] and and they you still have those same
[1:28:55] people today two years later
[1:28:57] right you have people that are on the
[1:28:59] extreme
[1:29:01] on both sides
[1:29:03] and yet scripture teaches us in all
[1:29:04] things
[1:29:06] you want to come and find that middle of
[1:29:07] the road
[1:29:08] where the truth is at
[1:29:10] although it's very hard because when you
[1:29:12] hit that middle center point
[1:29:14] people on both sides throw rocks at you
[1:29:18] and you just got to keep on walking
[1:29:19] knowing you're walking in the truth
[1:29:22] um
[1:29:23] and so
[1:29:25] some of these reactions and and
[1:29:28] i want you to keep that in mind i don't
[1:29:30] want to jump into it because because we
[1:29:32] can all identify with it i want you to
[1:29:34] as we as we're speaking i want you to
[1:29:36] think about the last couple of years and
[1:29:39] all the different ways people have
[1:29:40] responded the um both
[1:29:43] individually as governments as medical
[1:29:46] care
[1:29:46] and and all that and think about it
[1:29:48] there's always the physical and the
[1:29:50] spiritual always have an application
[1:29:53] and you know it's not when we talk about
[1:29:56] the physical there's not always an exact
[1:29:58] match and you can't if you take that too
[1:30:00] far down the road you'll end up down a
[1:30:02] rabbit hole you can't get out of or out
[1:30:03] on a branch that's about to get cut off
[1:30:06] but but there is similarities
[1:30:09] and we see that
[1:30:11] um
[1:30:12] but wanting to speak on
[1:30:14] a pandemic we've come become complacent
[1:30:16] with and you see that very quickly even
[1:30:18] today
[1:30:20] most of the world has already moved on
[1:30:24] we're moving on there's still little
[1:30:26] things that have changed about how we
[1:30:27] run our lives and things
[1:30:29] but
[1:30:30] we're not
[1:30:31] as concerned as we first were
[1:30:34] we have some concerns
[1:30:37] but we have found out that a lot of our
[1:30:40] concerns are very much based on how it
[1:30:42] affects our current lives
[1:30:45] because
[1:30:47] we tend to be more concerned
[1:30:49] if it'll help us get out of doing
[1:30:51] something we don't want to do
[1:30:53] but if but if it's a sale at your
[1:30:55] favorite store
[1:30:57] or or that show you always wanted to go
[1:31:00] see
[1:31:00] or something that you always wanted to
[1:31:02] do
[1:31:03] you'll do whatever it takes to get you
[1:31:04] there
[1:31:06] you know
[1:31:08] and
[1:31:10] so we've come to a place where we've
[1:31:12] learned to live with it and be okay with
[1:31:14] it
[1:31:15] and that's where we've come to in a lot
[1:31:17] of places with a lot of different
[1:31:20] diseases i just want to touch on them a
[1:31:22] couple i just have a few examples and
[1:31:24] i'm not really going to jump into i'm
[1:31:25] just going to put them out there so
[1:31:27] it'll help us think
[1:31:29] along the same line as we go you know um
[1:31:32] the world has faced many pandemics
[1:31:35] um i didn't go back that far i just
[1:31:37] picked some that i know are common names
[1:31:39] that we'll all kind of recognize uh the
[1:31:42] yellow fever
[1:31:43] killed thousands
[1:31:45] um the the one of the biggest breakouts
[1:31:47] that i just looked up very quickly was
[1:31:48] back in 1648.
[1:31:51] now the yellow fever is not gone
[1:31:54] we've learned how to live with it
[1:31:57] you see anyone panicking about the
[1:31:59] yellow fever these days
[1:32:00] it's there's still little outbreaks here
[1:32:02] and there
[1:32:04] but if it doesn't bother you today if
[1:32:06] it's not bothering you and your city
[1:32:07] you're not worried about it
[1:32:09] right you're not
[1:32:10] concerned um
[1:32:12] the spanish flu
[1:32:15] of
[1:32:16] 1918
[1:32:18] it was a version of the h1n1 virus
[1:32:22] killed it in percentage
[1:32:25] the
[1:32:26] versus the general population it killed
[1:32:29] as many or more than what we face today
[1:32:32] not in numbers because there wasn't as
[1:32:33] many people on on the face of the earth
[1:32:35] at the time
[1:32:36] but it killed as many or if not more
[1:32:39] the spanish flu and that version of the
[1:32:41] flu it's still here today
[1:32:43] in fact h1n1 was the the swine flu in
[1:32:46] 2009 that everybody panicked over i can
[1:32:49] remember flights having issues and being
[1:32:51] shut down and
[1:32:52] at the time i was living down closer to
[1:32:54] the mexican american border
[1:32:57] and it was extremely restricted with
[1:32:58] what you could do
[1:33:00] but very quickly we just move on we move
[1:33:03] on now h1n1 is still very much with us
[1:33:06] but we learn to live with it and be okay
[1:33:09] with it
[1:33:10] it's still here
[1:33:13] now i'm not this old
[1:33:15] but hiv for those of you who are around
[1:33:18] when hiv really broke out
[1:33:21] and the panic around it now because of
[1:33:24] my medical background i've read some of
[1:33:25] the histories but there's people treated
[1:33:27] like lepers
[1:33:31] hiv hiv is still with us today if not
[1:33:35] stronger than ever we just don't talk
[1:33:37] about it
[1:33:43] um
[1:33:45] the ebola virus
[1:33:47] it has many outbreaks right the one that
[1:33:50] i really remember is from 2014 because i
[1:33:53] just currently started working at a
[1:33:55] hospital in the phoenix area
[1:33:57] and it was a real concern now we're in
[1:33:59] arizona in the united states far away
[1:34:02] from anything that ever broke out but
[1:34:03] everybody had had a plan in case a case
[1:34:05] showed up
[1:34:07] they they put together a plan they
[1:34:09] created this special little box for
[1:34:11] collecting a sample if necessary they
[1:34:13] had a plan for how they would call in
[1:34:15] the special emergency team
[1:34:17] that would come in and set up a special
[1:34:19] tent outside the hospital in case that
[1:34:21] was the patient
[1:34:22] and you know what that box went into the
[1:34:25] freezer to get updated ever once in a
[1:34:27] while
[1:34:29] and within
[1:34:30] a few months year
[1:34:33] no one at the hospital was talking about
[1:34:34] it
[1:34:36] it wasn't that it wasn't affecting other
[1:34:37] people it just wasn't affecting us
[1:34:40] so we just
[1:34:41] lived with it
[1:34:45] the zika virus it's shown up many times
[1:34:48] but the more recent one was in 2015 i
[1:34:50] can remember that quite well as well
[1:34:52] everyone panicked there's no real
[1:34:54] specific testing for it and it all just
[1:34:57] like covid it has so many symptoms that
[1:35:00] are just like everything else
[1:35:05] so identifying it is really tough
[1:35:07] but
[1:35:08] it doesn't have any real serious harm on
[1:35:11] most people
[1:35:12] so what do we do we just live with it
[1:35:16] we just keep moving on
[1:35:18] and here that brings us to today
[1:35:21] covet 19
[1:35:23] right
[1:35:25] here we are
[1:35:26] do we have
[1:35:28] any real good answers for it today
[1:35:30] better than we did when it first arrived
[1:35:33] we don't
[1:35:35] we have developed things that help us
[1:35:37] feel better about it
[1:35:40] but it's still here and most there's
[1:35:42] countries already around the world that
[1:35:44] are deciding it's not a pandemic anymore
[1:35:46] it's an endemic
[1:35:48] so the pandemic's over
[1:35:50] and we're going to just going to move on
[1:35:51] with our lives
[1:35:53] that's it because that's all they can do
[1:35:56] they've run out of energy to panic
[1:35:59] and so now we just move on
[1:36:02] we just move on we just live with it we
[1:36:04] just become okay with it
[1:36:07] you know
[1:36:08] um and and i throw those up like i said
[1:36:11] i'm not going to go into detail on any
[1:36:13] one of them but i just want us to think
[1:36:14] about that because i'm leading up to
[1:36:16] something i'm i want us to think about
[1:36:18] the natural type because it's something
[1:36:19] that we can identify with
[1:36:21] right
[1:36:22] because sometimes we we talk about
[1:36:24] things in in spiritual types and
[1:36:26] mysteries and all that and i'm not
[1:36:28] against those things i love them that's
[1:36:30] great
[1:36:31] but it's hard for us sometimes to bring
[1:36:33] it down and apply it to ourselves
[1:36:36] so it's nice sometimes
[1:36:39] when we can take something that we've
[1:36:40] lived through we've gone through and
[1:36:43] it's even better when it's something
[1:36:44] that when we've gone through it as a
[1:36:45] body
[1:36:46] now we've all experienced it maybe a
[1:36:48] little bit different we've all
[1:36:49] approached it a little bit different
[1:36:52] we've all had different thoughts about
[1:36:54] it but we've all had to go through it
[1:36:57] so we can all identify around it and
[1:37:00] identify the same things together
[1:37:03] okay
[1:37:04] so
[1:37:05] now in regards to
[1:37:09] i want to touch on
[1:37:11] um
[1:37:13] something is that like hiv okay
[1:37:18] we've got to a place in society
[1:37:21] where
[1:37:22] it's become normalized
[1:37:24] and they've come up with they don't have
[1:37:26] a vaccine for it
[1:37:28] they don't have something that they can
[1:37:29] give you that'll stop you from getting
[1:37:31] it
[1:37:32] but they have developed ways to slow it
[1:37:34] down
[1:37:35] and put it into what they call remission
[1:37:39] where the disease is still sitting there
[1:37:42] at whatever point you had it
[1:37:44] and it was identified it's just sitting
[1:37:46] there hanging out
[1:37:47] it's just sitting there hanging out
[1:37:49] but remission is so
[1:37:52] it's considered so much better than the
[1:37:54] actual full-blown disease
[1:37:56] it's considered acceptable
[1:37:58] not only acceptable but i i was actually
[1:38:02] you know in regards to the amount of
[1:38:04] social media i'm sure we all consume
[1:38:06] um
[1:38:08] i was i saw some ads for hiv drug
[1:38:12] and
[1:38:14] it wasn't the advertising wasn't so much
[1:38:20] about
[1:38:21] how to get rid of hiv
[1:38:23] but it was about how to live with it
[1:38:27] and it's all good right if that's the
[1:38:29] best we can do with medical science in
[1:38:31] the physical world that's that's okay
[1:38:34] that's the best we have then let's do
[1:38:35] the best we can do
[1:38:38] but remember we want to continuously
[1:38:40] think about the spiritual
[1:38:42] application is that so many people in
[1:38:45] this life
[1:38:47] in the churches even ourselves with so
[1:38:50] many things that we're dealing with in
[1:38:51] life are okay with remission
[1:38:55] with a state of
[1:38:56] remission as long as it's not so bad
[1:39:01] as long as it's not getting worse
[1:39:03] it's good enough it's acceptable
[1:39:07] we're not looking for the cure anymore
[1:39:09] we're just looking for a state of
[1:39:11] remission
[1:39:13] where we're just doing okay
[1:39:15] and we can move on with life it's not
[1:39:17] bothering us anymore that drinking
[1:39:19] problem i had
[1:39:20] um
[1:39:22] i'm not i'm not an alcoholic anymore
[1:39:24] but have you been delivered
[1:39:27] of that spirit
[1:39:28] whatever it is you you take whatever it
[1:39:30] is you've dealt with
[1:39:32] and it may be that you've come to church
[1:39:34] and you have conformed
[1:39:38] to a way of living that has put your
[1:39:40] sins in remission
[1:39:45] but have you been delivered
[1:39:47] have you come to a state of deliverance
[1:39:49] have you come to a state of inoculation
[1:39:52] that has brought together a cure
[1:39:54] for that sin question
[1:39:58] you see
[1:39:59] because in remission all the symptoms
[1:40:01] are masked
[1:40:02] so the only person that knows that you
[1:40:04] have it still is you
[1:40:07] we can all sit here stand here hang out
[1:40:10] fellowship say all the right things
[1:40:12] do all the right things
[1:40:15] but in your heart
[1:40:17] what's going on what's happening are you
[1:40:19] still moving forward
[1:40:21] you see because there's something about
[1:40:23] you know
[1:40:24] the word that everyone has heard
[1:40:25] immunity right
[1:40:27] there's both um
[1:40:29] natural immunity
[1:40:30] and then immunity you can get from
[1:40:32] vaccines and that type of thing a
[1:40:33] natural immunity means you've
[1:40:35] encountered something and your body's
[1:40:36] built up an antibody to it something
[1:40:39] that resists it
[1:40:40] right
[1:40:42] but
[1:40:42] immunity is dependent on the strength of
[1:40:45] your immune system
[1:40:48] you see because you can develop immunity
[1:40:50] but as if something causes it to be
[1:40:53] weakened
[1:40:55] or to
[1:40:56] or the body in the case of a lot of
[1:40:58] elderly people as the body ages your
[1:41:00] body your body's immune system stops
[1:41:03] producing the antibodies
[1:41:05] to fight against those things as well
[1:41:09] and
[1:41:10] you know
[1:41:11] in regards to
[1:41:13] vaccinations and things a lot of times
[1:41:14] i'm sure i don't know if i'm sure a lot
[1:41:16] of people here have had a tetanus shot
[1:41:19] right
[1:41:20] you have to have another one what most
[1:41:22] times every 10 years
[1:41:24] why was it because the first one was no
[1:41:26] good
[1:41:27] no
[1:41:28] it's just specific because
[1:41:30] your body will recognize it they give it
[1:41:33] to you it'll make a certain amount of
[1:41:34] antibodies but those antibodies
[1:41:37] have a life cycle
[1:41:39] and then they start to weaken or the
[1:41:41] body just starts to make less
[1:41:43] and so they give you something that
[1:41:44] reminds you hey you got to make these
[1:41:48] to keep you healthy
[1:41:50] now the other thing about your your
[1:41:52] immune system isn't just
[1:41:55] updating your system with your
[1:41:57] inoculations
[1:41:59] but it has to do with your everyday
[1:42:01] lifestyle
[1:42:03] how are you treating the body
[1:42:06] what is your your your
[1:42:09] level of activity
[1:42:12] how are you
[1:42:13] exercising the body
[1:42:15] how what are you eating what is your the
[1:42:18] the
[1:42:18] nutrition that you're putting into the
[1:42:20] body to strengthen it
[1:42:22] and keep that immune system at the peak
[1:42:24] level where it should be
[1:42:26] so it can sustain itself
[1:42:29] and sustain those antibodies
[1:42:32] you know many times we we try and live
[1:42:34] off of a single experience
[1:42:37] as christians as message believers
[1:42:39] especially as let's say kids who have
[1:42:41] grown up in the message you know that
[1:42:43] would be me
[1:42:45] you know many people say you know
[1:42:46] especially the older people can claim
[1:42:48] i've been in the message 20 30 40 years
[1:42:51] well
[1:42:52] i've been in and around the message for
[1:42:54] over 30 years i was born in the pews
[1:42:59] it doesn't matter
[1:43:01] it takes a daily renewing
[1:43:05] it takes a daily life
[1:43:09] but a daily knife is not enough
[1:43:12] you need that
[1:43:13] inoculation
[1:43:15] and that booster shot
[1:43:18] every single time
[1:43:22] what was yesterday yesterday's not good
[1:43:24] enough for today
[1:43:26] you see
[1:43:28] and
[1:43:29] many people
[1:43:31] don't even want the first shot
[1:43:37] because they're scared of what it will
[1:43:38] do to them they'll scare of how it will
[1:43:41] change them
[1:43:43] now
[1:43:46] let's take a look
[1:43:48] you know we're just doing a little
[1:43:50] teaching here and i'm watching the clock
[1:43:51] it's 12 30. i'll try not to hold you
[1:43:54] long here
[1:43:55] um
[1:44:07] i'm going to read something for you here
[1:44:11] now we know
[1:44:13] when the inoculation was introduced at
[1:44:15] calvary
[1:44:18] right because the old testament coming
[1:44:20] all the way up until calvary
[1:44:23] was full of remedies for sin
[1:44:27] they were given remedies for sin meaning
[1:44:29] here you have this sin disease and if
[1:44:33] you take this remedy it'll make you feel
[1:44:35] better you'll still have the syn disease
[1:44:38] but it'll push your sin disease into a
[1:44:40] bit of remission
[1:44:42] until the next time you have that urge
[1:44:44] to the next time you're tempted until
[1:44:46] the next time but it'll give you a
[1:44:48] little relief
[1:44:50] okay
[1:44:52] but
[1:44:53] in here ye him
[1:44:55] brother branham it
[1:44:57] says
[1:44:58] on the day of pentecost when the balm
[1:45:00] was poured out we had a doctor there his
[1:45:03] name was dr simon peter
[1:45:04] and he wrote a prescription he said
[1:45:07] they said
[1:45:08] what can we do to get inoculated from
[1:45:11] this sin question
[1:45:14] there was a time when there was no
[1:45:16] inoculation but we got it now
[1:45:19] so how
[1:45:21] can we
[1:45:23] do to get over this
[1:45:25] what did you tell them dr simon peter
[1:45:28] he said repent every one of you and be
[1:45:30] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:45:33] the remissions of your sins and you
[1:45:36] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:45:39] for the promise
[1:45:41] the prescription hallelujah this
[1:45:43] prescription what the prescription
[1:45:45] writes is the holy ghost
[1:45:47] the prescription is good for this
[1:45:49] generation and that generation and
[1:45:52] everyone that the lord our god shall
[1:45:53] call it's a cure for sin it's a double
[1:45:56] cure for sin and sickness
[1:45:59] now
[1:46:00] he jumped down a little bit and it's
[1:46:02] he's talking about the ministry and he
[1:46:05] said if some of these little quack
[1:46:07] druggists are supposed to be doctors
[1:46:08] tries to tamper with that prescription
[1:46:10] it'll kill the patient and that's what
[1:46:12] the matter today they're killing
[1:46:15] spiritually dying because they're
[1:46:16] substituting a handshake instead of a
[1:46:18] baptism of the holy ghost and they're
[1:46:20] killing the patient
[1:46:23] no
[1:46:26] i'm just skipping on down
[1:46:28] when god's going to try this inoculation
[1:46:31] he never tried it on a guinea pig
[1:46:33] he put it on his son and it held amen
[1:46:37] now listen
[1:46:39] he just told us
[1:46:40] he tried it and it held now he's going
[1:46:43] to tell us how it held
[1:46:45] okay
[1:46:46] this is very important
[1:46:48] um
[1:46:49] when they spit in his face he said
[1:46:51] nothing about it
[1:46:54] when they asked him to go one mile
[1:46:57] he went to
[1:46:58] now let me touch on that real quick
[1:47:00] because you know in the scripture those
[1:47:02] of you who are scholars in the scripture
[1:47:04] and many of you even beyond
[1:47:06] my knowledge
[1:47:08] the scripture says you know they asked
[1:47:10] him he said
[1:47:11] ask jesus you know in regards to what
[1:47:13] shall we do if they ask us to go one
[1:47:15] mile
[1:47:16] he said if they ask you to go one mile
[1:47:18] go two
[1:47:19] now it's important to know the context
[1:47:22] around that
[1:47:24] is the context around that
[1:47:26] is the jews during the time of jesus
[1:47:28] were a conquered people
[1:47:30] by rome
[1:47:32] and a roman citizen but especially a
[1:47:35] roman soldier
[1:47:37] had
[1:47:39] the
[1:47:41] authority
[1:47:42] to request any of the jewish conquered
[1:47:45] people not another roman citizen but any
[1:47:48] of the conquered people to carry his
[1:47:50] military pack one mile
[1:47:54] now they were not best friends
[1:47:56] they were not even of the same country
[1:47:58] this is
[1:48:00] someone that they shared a deep hatred
[1:48:02] for could order him like a servant
[1:48:06] you have to carry this pack 60 70 pounds
[1:48:10] of equipment and armor
[1:48:13] one mile
[1:48:15] and jesus tells him
[1:48:18] if they ask you to carry it one mile
[1:48:20] carry it to
[1:48:22] okay
[1:48:23] so we're talking about the inoculation
[1:48:25] holding
[1:48:28] okay we're getting into where it's at
[1:48:32] we're not just looking at
[1:48:33] oh
[1:48:34] great we have a we have a fix everyone
[1:48:36] let's get excited let's be happy about
[1:48:38] it
[1:48:40] because we're going to find out we want
[1:48:42] to look into why
[1:48:44] why
[1:48:46] as he said
[1:48:47] why
[1:48:48] are my children still sick is there no
[1:48:50] bomb in gilead
[1:48:53] he said did not i provide you with the
[1:48:55] cure
[1:48:57] why haven't they taken it
[1:49:01] why aren't they taking this inoculation
[1:49:05] what's going on
[1:49:07] and we're going to start digging in we
[1:49:09] want to so we want to find out what this
[1:49:11] inoculation does
[1:49:13] because we know the scripture talks
[1:49:15] about it being
[1:49:16] sweet in the mouth
[1:49:17] and bitter in the belly
[1:49:20] so at first we're excited about it but
[1:49:22] then the reality hits of what that's
[1:49:23] going to do
[1:49:25] and we're like oh no
[1:49:26] i didn't sign up for that
[1:49:31] because
[1:49:33] if any of us
[1:49:36] and let's make it real personal right
[1:49:39] let's say the jew that is being asked to
[1:49:41] carry that pack a mile
[1:49:43] you me
[1:49:46] had had family members recently slain
[1:49:49] by
[1:49:51] roman soldiers maybe not that exact
[1:49:53] roman soldier but it doesn't matter to
[1:49:55] you right
[1:49:58] so now not only are you carrying the
[1:50:00] pack of someone that
[1:50:02] is invading your country
[1:50:04] is telling you what to do
[1:50:06] but you know that they're directly
[1:50:08] responsible for the deaths of your
[1:50:09] family
[1:50:13] you know i've i've never experienced
[1:50:16] that where someone has murdered someone
[1:50:18] close to me but i've experienced someone
[1:50:21] who
[1:50:22] has murdered the reputation of someone
[1:50:24] close to me
[1:50:26] and that's pretty painful
[1:50:29] you know
[1:50:31] um
[1:50:33] would you are you still going to be
[1:50:34] willing
[1:50:36] you see it's bitter in the belly
[1:50:39] the living of it
[1:50:41] it's not
[1:50:42] all
[1:50:44] roses and
[1:50:45] and
[1:50:46] you know
[1:50:48] lemonade and cookies and hanging out and
[1:50:50] picnics this is a war
[1:50:54] but the battle we face is much harder
[1:50:56] than one that it would take to pick up a
[1:50:58] sword or a gun and kill somebody
[1:51:00] because it's a death to self
[1:51:02] all the way
[1:51:03] we're not called
[1:51:05] we're not called in the name of our god
[1:51:08] to kill others
[1:51:10] we're called to die for him if necessary
[1:51:13] but most of this war is fought
[1:51:16] internally
[1:51:19] this this
[1:51:20] flesh having to die to itself
[1:51:23] its own thoughts its own ideas its own
[1:51:26] ability
[1:51:27] this diseased
[1:51:29] flesh
[1:51:30] that was diseased at the fall
[1:51:34] we're having to fight against that
[1:51:38] okay
[1:51:40] then
[1:51:42] he went to then in death it held and in
[1:51:44] the resurrection it held
[1:51:46] now listen
[1:51:48] it held he said it worked
[1:51:50] and every one of these people won't go
[1:51:53] for this inoculation
[1:51:56] and there it is
[1:51:58] now
[1:51:59] here's something
[1:52:01] to think about
[1:52:02] medicine will make one person act one
[1:52:04] way
[1:52:05] and one another but when the holy ghost
[1:52:08] medicine comes
[1:52:09] it makes them everyone act the same
[1:52:15] and you say wow that's great because
[1:52:16] then if i see how someone else who got
[1:52:18] it acts then i know exactly what's going
[1:52:20] to happen
[1:52:22] yeah that's true
[1:52:25] and the greatest example of that was
[1:52:26] jesus christ
[1:52:29] and that's why so many
[1:52:31] they don't want it
[1:52:33] they want the they want to live around
[1:52:35] it
[1:52:37] they want some of the benefits
[1:52:39] they want to come and and play church
[1:52:42] they want some remission because it's
[1:52:45] the load that they're carrying is so
[1:52:47] heavy
[1:52:51] that they want to come in and get a
[1:52:52] little bit of relief sunday and
[1:52:54] wednesday right let's come in
[1:52:57] okay i feel better now
[1:53:00] but
[1:53:01] i don't want to change how i'm living
[1:53:04] that's causing all this burden all this
[1:53:06] guilt
[1:53:07] to sit on my shoulders
[1:53:09] i want to go back out live the exact
[1:53:11] same way
[1:53:13] that's why religion
[1:53:15] people love religion so much
[1:53:18] because it allows you to come in and
[1:53:19] confess
[1:53:21] to the priest
[1:53:22] confess to the pastor
[1:53:24] do your little penance
[1:53:27] and i use the word penance and everyone
[1:53:29] associates that with catholicism but all
[1:53:31] the all the denominations do the same
[1:53:33] thing they all come in they come in on
[1:53:35] sunday and that's their penance because
[1:53:37] they come in they sit through a church
[1:53:39] service they didn't want to be in
[1:53:42] so it's like a punishment
[1:53:44] it's the same spirit
[1:53:45] they they do it different ways
[1:53:48] but many of us do the same thing here we
[1:53:50] want to you know brother branham
[1:53:52] touched on denomination and and all that
[1:53:56] over and over and so the ones he listed
[1:53:57] were the pentecostals and the
[1:53:59] presbyterians and the baptists but if he
[1:54:00] was here today he would list the message
[1:54:02] right in there
[1:54:04] because
[1:54:06] that it's a spirit he was fighting
[1:54:08] against it wasn't a title or a name or a
[1:54:10] group of people
[1:54:12] it's a spirit
[1:54:14] and
[1:54:15] if you'll notice
[1:54:17] when back here that first
[1:54:20] um quote i read out of the sardisian
[1:54:22] church age
[1:54:24] brother adam didn't say shun
[1:54:26] shun drinking he didn't say shun
[1:54:28] cigarettes
[1:54:29] he didn't say shun adulterous living
[1:54:34] those things are all very obvious
[1:54:37] science and it you know it wasn't a
[1:54:39] christian organization
[1:54:41] that decided that smoking caused cancer
[1:54:44] or that drinking
[1:54:46] can uh destroy your life
[1:54:48] those are obvious things
[1:54:50] that's why people start out young
[1:54:52] they're partying partying and most
[1:54:54] people as they get older
[1:54:55] they ease away from it
[1:54:57] because they know if i stay on this line
[1:54:59] of thinking
[1:55:00] it's going to destroy my life
[1:55:03] no they may still play with the ed you
[1:55:05] play around it
[1:55:08] but
[1:55:09] it doesn't take no rocket scientist it
[1:55:11] doesn't take no great revelation to know
[1:55:13] these are not good things for you
[1:55:18] and yet so many times we find ourselves
[1:55:20] making these things the focus right
[1:55:23] it's the visible symptoms of sin
[1:55:27] it's the visible symptoms of the virus
[1:55:30] they got a fever they
[1:55:33] they're dehydrated there are you know
[1:55:35] all these different things
[1:55:37] well yeah you could treat the fever
[1:55:41] you could treat
[1:55:43] whatever the symptom is
[1:55:45] and it may reduce the symptom for a
[1:55:47] while
[1:55:48] but the minute you stop that treatment
[1:55:50] of that symptom oh i think they're
[1:55:52] better
[1:55:53] comes back with a vengeance worse than
[1:55:55] ever before
[1:55:56] because it's just sitting there waiting
[1:55:57] it's sitting there waiting so what was
[1:56:00] it that he was telling us to shun
[1:56:03] he says shun the religions of the world
[1:56:06] like you shun the plague
[1:56:12] okay
[1:56:13] and
[1:56:15] brother one when he read
[1:56:17] the quote out of the seals today
[1:56:20] i thought it was so pertinent it touched
[1:56:22] on church politics he said the church
[1:56:25] when the spirit of god came down to move
[1:56:28] on the people
[1:56:30] they were so ingrained in their own
[1:56:32] politics
[1:56:33] and system
[1:56:35] they couldn't see it
[1:56:37] in fact they didn't want to see it
[1:56:39] because to see it would require them to
[1:56:41] release their own physical power hold on
[1:56:44] the people
[1:56:46] and once they've become so drunken with
[1:56:49] power
[1:56:51] right because that's that's the whole
[1:56:52] spirit from the beginning
[1:56:54] is the same spirit in the end where it
[1:56:56] says that beast that woman
[1:56:59] she was drunken with the blood of the
[1:57:01] saints
[1:57:02] drunken with power
[1:57:05] with life and death in her hands
[1:57:07] or so she thinks
[1:57:10] right
[1:57:11] she's controlling the kings of the world
[1:57:15] and it's having to give those things up
[1:57:18] they'll never do
[1:57:19] as a system and yet we find ourselves as
[1:57:22] individuals in that same position
[1:57:24] because billy branham said what does it
[1:57:25] take
[1:57:27] to be a denomination now well you think
[1:57:29] well you need multiple churches and they
[1:57:31] need to have a set dogma and set things
[1:57:34] that they they claim to believe and
[1:57:36] creeds and all these things he said no
[1:57:38] no no
[1:57:39] one person
[1:57:42] and they don't even have to be off
[1:57:44] doing home church on their own it could
[1:57:46] be me
[1:57:47] it could be you sitting right here we
[1:57:49] come here every time but in our own spot
[1:57:52] that we sit
[1:57:54] we're our own denomination
[1:57:56] we hold our own views we hold our own
[1:57:58] creeds
[1:58:00] and
[1:58:00] we rejoice and get excited when the
[1:58:02] pastor says something that we think we
[1:58:04] agree with and if not
[1:58:11] right
[1:58:12] it's the same spirit
[1:58:14] and it's the spirit that we're fighting
[1:58:15] against
[1:58:17] you see now now if you
[1:58:19] live long enough and you were in the
[1:58:20] right position in the right places and
[1:58:22] whatnot sure
[1:58:24] we can see it in many churches
[1:58:27] both in the message and everywhere
[1:58:29] across the world from the last
[1:58:31] 6 000
[1:58:33] or if a man gets put in a position
[1:58:36] where he has his own ideas
[1:58:39] where he can take power he will
[1:58:42] over as many people as he can
[1:58:45] and then he does exactly what the
[1:58:46] denominational spirit will always do as
[1:58:49] he finds a way to hold those people in
[1:58:51] fear
[1:58:53] and you know how they do that
[1:58:56] they wave
[1:58:58] this inoculation over them
[1:59:02] like a carrot
[1:59:04] in front of the donkey
[1:59:07] and they go look it
[1:59:09] all you people all you sinners
[1:59:11] you should have this
[1:59:13] and then as the people get closer and
[1:59:15] closer and they're almost about to reach
[1:59:17] out and grab it they go
[1:59:20] you're all sinners you don't deserve it
[1:59:24] i have it
[1:59:25] i'll let you know
[1:59:27] what god wants you to have
[1:59:30] and it's the same system over and over
[1:59:32] again it doesn't matter if it's one
[1:59:33] person over himself
[1:59:35] and you say over yourself yeah
[1:59:39] because we'll sit there
[1:59:41] and we'll god will be dealing with your
[1:59:43] life he'll be dealing with your life
[1:59:44] he'll be working on you working on you
[1:59:47] and you know oh i just
[1:59:49] i just want to serve the lord i i just
[1:59:51] want the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:54] and you'll come crawling up to the altar
[1:59:57] you'll come in a state of repentance you
[2:00:00] start getting your life right and what i
[2:00:02] mean is god will start getting your life
[2:00:03] right
[2:00:05] you know the minute i know we always say
[2:00:06] we or i
[2:00:08] um but from justification sanctification
[2:00:11] the baptism of the holy ghost the life
[2:00:13] of god himself in you ain't none of it
[2:00:15] you
[2:00:16] it's you just letting go and accepting
[2:00:20] it's like once that inoculation is put
[2:00:21] in your arm
[2:00:23] you don't do anything
[2:00:28] as far as i know
[2:00:30] i mean i've had a few vaccinations over
[2:00:32] the years
[2:00:33] the only thing i did is it hurt a little
[2:00:36] bit sometimes
[2:00:37] you put some ice on it
[2:00:39] so it's not quite so bad
[2:00:42] but that was the end
[2:00:43] it was you
[2:00:45] surrendering yourself for it to be
[2:00:47] applied
[2:00:49] and that's the truth from justification
[2:00:52] you have to come in and surrender
[2:00:54] yourself and let that be applied to your
[2:00:56] life because you can't justify yourself
[2:00:59] if you think you can
[2:01:01] you're living in this remission state
[2:01:03] if you think you had anything to do with
[2:01:05] your
[2:01:06] justification you're just you're just
[2:01:09] doing the whole
[2:01:10] religious thing
[2:01:12] you're coming in you're
[2:01:13] you're making yourself feel good on
[2:01:15] sunday and wednesday
[2:01:17] justified walk out
[2:01:20] and you know the best way to identify
[2:01:22] that
[2:01:24] is when
[2:01:25] i'm justified
[2:01:27] that i'm not as bad as that guy
[2:01:31] you're not justified
[2:01:33] you're just self-righteous
[2:01:36] because justification is a work of grace
[2:01:40] and a grace has been applied in your
[2:01:41] life at whatever level it's been applied
[2:01:45] all you can do is extend grace
[2:01:48] extend grace that's why brother branham
[2:01:50] said he said
[2:01:51] he said knowledge will just puff you up
[2:01:55] but he said a real revelation
[2:01:57] at any level it's not you know you don't
[2:02:00] have to get a
[2:02:01] have a revelation of everything at once
[2:02:03] nobody does none of us will until we
[2:02:05] cross to the other side and even then
[2:02:07] the lord will have a lot to share with
[2:02:09] us i'm looking forward to it it'll be
[2:02:11] great
[2:02:12] but whatever little revelation you have
[2:02:15] you can't help share it with others and
[2:02:18] i don't always mean oh you're going to
[2:02:19] go tell them exactly what happened with
[2:02:21] your words
[2:02:22] but your actions will share it with them
[2:02:26] because you'll know wow
[2:02:28] look at what god forgave me of
[2:02:31] and you'll be able to extend that same
[2:02:32] grace to those who have offended you
[2:02:36] now if you find that you're struggling
[2:02:39] to offend those who offended you
[2:02:42] i don't say you've never been forgiven
[2:02:44] i don't say you don't have a revelation
[2:02:46] of grace
[2:02:47] i said we're ready for another booster
[2:02:49] shot and inoculation of the holy spirit
[2:02:51] in our lives
[2:02:52] we're ready to keep moving
[2:02:55] so that god can renew us once again
[2:02:58] and we can feel his spirit moving
[2:03:00] and that love of god will this
[2:03:03] flow over us and encapsulate us in his
[2:03:05] love
[2:03:06] so much that all we can do is just share
[2:03:09] that love
[2:03:10] share his love
[2:03:11] share his love not a filial love that is
[2:03:15] based on you do for me i do for you know
[2:03:18] i scratch your back you scratch my back
[2:03:20] but based on you scratch my back i'll
[2:03:22] give you a back rub
[2:03:29] but but you see what i mean
[2:03:31] is that
[2:03:34] they came to arrest jesus
[2:03:36] in the garden
[2:03:39] and the servant cut
[2:03:41] his
[2:03:42] p cut the the peter cut the ear off of
[2:03:45] the servant
[2:03:47] and jesus didn't say served you're right
[2:03:49] buddy
[2:03:52] he said no no no peter put your sword
[2:03:54] away what are you doing man
[2:03:56] here hold on
[2:03:59] the guy didn't even know what happened
[2:04:01] one minute his ear hurt the next minute
[2:04:03] it didn't hurt
[2:04:04] he had some dried blood like he wasn't
[2:04:07] sure what happened it was dark it was
[2:04:09] torches i don't know if you've ever been
[2:04:10] out in the wilderness in the dark
[2:04:13] with old tree canopy but a few tortures
[2:04:15] everything's shadowy
[2:04:18] i mean this was torches it wasn't
[2:04:19] exactly modern lighting
[2:04:22] he felt something hit him
[2:04:24] it hurt for a second
[2:04:26] jesus touched him it all felt better and
[2:04:29] he walked away he had no clue
[2:04:32] what happened
[2:04:34] i'm sure he questioned it later
[2:04:36] but in the moment jesus said no no no no
[2:04:40] i already told you guys and you guys
[2:04:41] haven't been paying attention
[2:04:43] and you don't have a revelation of
[2:04:45] what's happening but you will one day
[2:04:48] you will one day
[2:04:50] but that's what we're called to
[2:04:52] is that
[2:04:54] someone comes to do you wrong
[2:04:57] and you see them hurting
[2:04:59] and you do them good
[2:05:03] that that really bites against the
[2:05:05] natural
[2:05:07] our nature
[2:05:09] like it's it's hard enough to say i
[2:05:10] forgive you and now i just don't want to
[2:05:12] ever see you again
[2:05:16] that's tough enough
[2:05:17] to really i forgive you i understand you
[2:05:21] know the whole you know between kids all
[2:05:23] the time parents say what well say
[2:05:25] you're sorry i'm sorry
[2:05:29] you're not sorry
[2:05:30] you're not even a little bit sorry you
[2:05:32] just want to you just want to get out of
[2:05:33] the situation
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:37] but real true forgiveness
[2:05:40] where i forgive you
[2:05:42] i don't even hold it against you anymore
[2:05:45] now i get it we have to use wisdom the
[2:05:47] lord gives us wisdom and sometimes when
[2:05:50] people break trust they have to rebuild
[2:05:52] that trust
[2:05:54] but it's the ability to know you've been
[2:05:57] harmed or someone you love has been
[2:05:59] harmed
[2:06:00] and then still be able to reach out
[2:06:02] in grace
[2:06:06] because you know
[2:06:07] that god can use you to do something
[2:06:10] with no thought that
[2:06:13] they'll ever
[2:06:14] without even thinking you know many
[2:06:16] times we go oh okay they harm me they
[2:06:18] don't like me
[2:06:20] um
[2:06:21] if i do this for them
[2:06:23] we'll become best buds
[2:06:26] we're gonna become friends
[2:06:27] that's not
[2:06:29] no
[2:06:30] unless they catch the same revelation
[2:06:32] that you're catching
[2:06:34] you may help them and they may resent
[2:06:36] you for it
[2:06:37] because now they're more ain't mad at
[2:06:38] you
[2:06:41] and you have to be okay with that
[2:06:45] you have to be okay
[2:06:47] with the results of the inoculation
[2:06:49] and what it will cause you to do
[2:06:56] but this is why he said why and every
[2:06:58] one of these people won't go for
[2:07:00] inoculation and there it is
[2:07:03] okay
[2:07:04] um
[2:07:06] we were talking about just touch on
[2:07:08] church politics and i know i'm running
[2:07:10] around and i'm sorry um
[2:07:12] but
[2:07:14] we see it so much
[2:07:15] church politics and we see it today
[2:07:18] we see it within this message i know i
[2:07:20] have and i have not even been that many
[2:07:22] places i've been a few places
[2:07:25] but you see where
[2:07:27] one minister ministers for this church
[2:07:30] and because this church and this church
[2:07:32] aren't getting along
[2:07:34] then
[2:07:35] they break fellowship with the minister
[2:07:37] that went administered over there
[2:07:39] you
[2:07:40] me and me and brother so and so we're
[2:07:42] not getting along so if you're friends
[2:07:44] with him you can't be friends with me
[2:07:48] and we're it's it's politics it's it's a
[2:07:52] denominational spirit you see because we
[2:07:55] have moved away
[2:07:57] from taking sides with jesus
[2:08:00] we have moved away from this inoculation
[2:08:03] and because you know why we don't want
[2:08:06] the effects of it
[2:08:08] we we want the the idea of it
[2:08:11] grace and love especially for us
[2:08:15] but we don't want to take that shot
[2:08:18] because that shot will then cause a
[2:08:20] change in our nature
[2:08:22] a change in who we are
[2:08:24] it'll force us to drink that same bitter
[2:08:26] cup
[2:08:27] that christ drank
[2:08:30] and we had to submit ourselves in the
[2:08:32] same way
[2:08:34] and say lord not my will but thy will be
[2:08:37] done to the point where it stresses you
[2:08:40] doing the right thing stresses you out
[2:08:41] so much
[2:08:44] that you would bleed from your forehead
[2:08:48] because that's what christ did as a man
[2:08:50] he was so stressed emotionally
[2:08:56] this is not something miraculous this is
[2:08:58] actually a known phenomena
[2:09:00] in in the scientific world with the
[2:09:02] body where someone under extreme such
[2:09:05] extreme stress
[2:09:07] their blood pressure is up so high that
[2:09:10] it actually bursts the capillaries up
[2:09:13] here in the forehead
[2:09:15] and that's why you sweat blood and
[2:09:18] that's what jesus went under there in
[2:09:20] prayer he went in to the garden as a man
[2:09:26] to bear our sins
[2:09:28] that cup he was to drink
[2:09:30] was our sins he had to take it upon
[2:09:33] himself
[2:09:35] in order then take it to the cross
[2:09:38] and pay the price
[2:09:40] because
[2:09:41] in order to pay the price for it
[2:09:44] he had to purchase it
[2:09:46] and when you purchase it it becomes
[2:09:48] yours
[2:09:52] and so that
[2:09:54] all that stress and emotion
[2:09:57] of taking on not just your sins not just
[2:10:00] my sins
[2:10:01] but the sins of the entire world every
[2:10:04] person from the beginning of time to the
[2:10:06] end of time it doesn't say he took on
[2:10:09] just the sins of his children
[2:10:12] it says he took on the sins of the world
[2:10:18] now whether or not everyone will accept
[2:10:19] it the inoculation
[2:10:21] is up to them but he already paid the
[2:10:24] price
[2:10:25] for all of them
[2:10:26] he drank that cup
[2:10:29] and took on all their sins
[2:10:33] no matter how bad or how evil
[2:10:36] you might think they were
[2:10:38] you think oh murder could never get in
[2:10:40] well paul murdered someone
[2:10:43] well liars can't well there's plenty of
[2:10:44] liars in heaven
[2:10:47] they're not liars anymore
[2:10:52] but they did
[2:10:54] they did it
[2:10:56] anything you can think of
[2:10:58] that we might not be able to forgive
[2:11:00] someone for
[2:11:02] he took that cup
[2:11:04] and he paid the price
[2:11:06] that's why
[2:11:08] as he took
[2:11:10] to prepare that inoculation
[2:11:13] and get ready to pay the price
[2:11:15] he came under that level of stress it
[2:11:17] was that stressful
[2:11:19] so you say oh i can't do that that's too
[2:11:21] hard i can't forgive that person
[2:11:23] or i can't
[2:11:24] that's that's asking too much
[2:11:29] it might be too much for you right now
[2:11:32] you just need just like all of us a
[2:11:33] little more grace
[2:11:36] you need another booster shot you need
[2:11:38] another
[2:11:39] walk to the altar and i don't mean the
[2:11:41] front of the church
[2:11:43] although it could be
[2:11:45] but i mean that place where you and god
[2:11:47] meet
[2:11:49] where you feel his presence come down
[2:11:53] and no matter who you are
[2:11:55] how tough you think you are how tough
[2:11:57] you think you've been the situations you
[2:11:59] think you've been through that have made
[2:12:00] you so hard
[2:12:02] that presence comes by
[2:12:05] oh and it just melts you down
[2:12:08] you just feel everything all that
[2:12:10] resistance melting away
[2:12:12] and the tears will come from your eyes i
[2:12:14] don't say you'll get super emotional
[2:12:16] maybe that's not who you are who god
[2:12:17] made you
[2:12:20] but you'll know he's there
[2:12:22] and it'll bring a fear it'll bring a
[2:12:25] love it'll bring a grace
[2:12:27] like you've never known
[2:12:30] and i know because we have examples
[2:12:33] of it
[2:12:34] not only in scripture
[2:12:36] but from this message
[2:12:38] let me
[2:12:42] let me go there

[2:14:36] if you can't take something that you
[2:14:38] think is true
[2:14:39] and walk it from genesis to revelation
[2:14:42] and not just find your one favorite

[2:15:03] because i tell you what
[2:15:05] if it was a blessing right now or in any
[2:15:08] service

[2:15:11] just
[2:15:12] explode
[2:15:13] the blessings will just rain down
[2:15:15] it'll be unbelievable you'll enter into
[2:15:17] a place where where time does not exist
[2:15:20] for a short moment you'll be able to
[2:15:22] enter into that eternity you came from
[2:15:25] and time will just slip away it'll be
[2:15:27] wonderful
[2:15:29] it'll be wonderful
[2:15:30] all right
[2:15:32] adoption
[2:15:33] 1960
[2:15:35] many people are afraid you're going to
[2:15:37] act funny
[2:15:38] many people are afraid the holy ghost
[2:15:39] will make you do something you'll be
[2:15:41] ashamed of people many people are afraid
[2:15:43] they'll cry
[2:15:45] and their sweetheart will see them
[2:15:46] crying or mama or your neighbor or your
[2:15:49] boss will see you
[2:15:52] let me tell you about
[2:15:53] a man one time before closing there was
[2:15:56] a man named david
[2:15:57] and when the ark of god
[2:15:59] had been down in the philistine land
[2:16:02] and had come across pulled by
[2:16:04] an ark old ox was pulling them and david
[2:16:07] saw that ark coming he had a little
[2:16:10] going on
[2:16:12] going on him he ran out there he kicked
[2:16:15] his feet in the air and jumped around
[2:16:16] and screamed and jumped and danced and
[2:16:19] jumped and danced and him the king of
[2:16:22] israel
[2:16:23] and his wife
[2:16:24] now she wasn't an unbeliever
[2:16:27] she wasn't even a stranger
[2:16:30] this was someone who's the you're most
[2:16:32] supposed to be your most intimate friend
[2:16:34] and supporter
[2:16:39] and for those of you who aren't married
[2:16:40] just think of it as your best friend
[2:16:42] the person who you trust the most
[2:16:45] here you are you're rejoicing you're
[2:16:47] having a good old time god's revealing
[2:16:49] things to you and you're just so excited
[2:16:54] and
[2:17:02] and his wife looked out the window saw
[2:17:04] him acting so strange she despised him
[2:17:07] you know why
[2:17:10] it's because
[2:17:11] she saw something she wanted that's why
[2:17:14] she married him
[2:17:16] but it didn't make any sense to her
[2:17:18] no revelation
[2:17:20] she read all the same scriptures
[2:17:22] she knew the importance of the art
[2:17:25] but there was something about it
[2:17:27] that her prestige her own personal
[2:17:29] prestige
[2:17:31] was more important
[2:17:33] it wasn't she wasn't living a life of
[2:17:35] sin
[2:17:36] but it was her own importance and how
[2:17:38] people would see her
[2:17:41] that had her hold herself back
[2:17:44] that's right no no no
[2:17:46] what will people think
[2:17:48] i'm important
[2:17:50] now that's your first problem
[2:17:52] is you think you're important
[2:17:55] you're not
[2:17:57] you know
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:00] and
[2:18:02] his wife looked out the window and she
[2:18:03] saw him acting so strange she despised
[2:18:05] him
[2:18:06] why because we always despise
[2:18:08] that's the problem you know you see and
[2:18:10] and i know there's
[2:18:12] differences but this is just
[2:18:13] characterizing things right we look at
[2:18:16] people let's say who have a lot of money
[2:18:18] and we always think ah
[2:18:21] i bet the way they got their money
[2:18:22] wasn't right
[2:18:25] yeah look at me i work hard and i ain't
[2:18:27] got nothing
[2:18:29] they did something dirty
[2:18:31] why because we need to tear them down a
[2:18:34] little bit
[2:18:34] to make us feel like
[2:18:36] okay now i can live with this situation
[2:18:38] i won't do anything about increasing my
[2:18:41] situation
[2:18:42] i won't go
[2:18:43] learn something or i won't go ask for
[2:18:46] advice or anything because of our pride
[2:18:49] but if i can be like i'm doing it right
[2:18:52] they're doing it wrong that's why
[2:18:53] they're just living off of their
[2:18:55] ill-gotten gains
[2:18:58] okay now i feel better
[2:19:00] and and that's where she was at
[2:19:03] she didn't she didn't want
[2:19:06] to sacrifice herself she didn't want to
[2:19:08] go hey david why are you so excited
[2:19:10] about this what what what is bringing
[2:19:12] you such joy that you would debate
[2:19:13] yourself in such a way i mean you're a
[2:19:15] king
[2:19:16] don't you have a responsibility to the
[2:19:18] people to be kingly
[2:19:21] no
[2:19:22] it was just instant look at him
[2:19:25] there he goes again yeah
[2:19:28] and she despised him why she must have
[2:19:30] said the idiot look at him out there the
[2:19:32] way he's acting throwing his feet in the
[2:19:33] air and jumping around acting like that
[2:19:35] why he must be crazy
[2:19:38] and that night when he come in she said
[2:19:40] in words like this why
[2:19:42] you've embarrassed me why you the king
[2:19:44] my husband out here doing like that
[2:19:46] acting like that david said tomorrow
[2:19:48] i'll do better
[2:19:50] now that's a great example for all of us
[2:19:53] because many times what happens to us
[2:19:56] is that person that we trust so much
[2:19:58] that person that we put such confidence
[2:20:01] in they'll say something negative to us
[2:20:04] and we'll go
[2:20:06] oh
[2:20:07] okay
[2:20:08] i won't do that no more
[2:20:10] and we just go find a place to go sit
[2:20:12] and and sulk and hide
[2:20:16] don't do that
[2:20:17] now if you're really doing something
[2:20:18] wrong and someone corrects you maybe you
[2:20:20] need to
[2:20:21] take a little humility
[2:20:22] but david wasn't
[2:20:24] responding to her out of
[2:20:26] pride
[2:20:28] he was saying i'm worshiping my god
[2:20:31] he said he set me free he's given me
[2:20:32] supper revelation he brought me from
[2:20:35] that sheep
[2:20:38] coat there where i was just watching
[2:20:40] over some sheep i was a nobody
[2:20:42] and he's the one who made me king and
[2:20:44] i'm rejoicing because he's coming to
[2:20:48] live in the place where i am at
[2:20:50] i'm finally able to bring him and exalt
[2:20:54] him and glorify him in a way that he
[2:20:56] should be glorified
[2:20:58] he made me king and i will never cease
[2:21:01] to praise him in front of anybody
[2:21:05] you see
[2:21:06] he said don't you know i was dancing
[2:21:08] unto the lord
[2:21:10] he crossed over he was in the land of
[2:21:12] promise
[2:21:13] now let me touch something real quick
[2:21:14] just so everyone is clear
[2:21:16] you know a lot of people minister and
[2:21:18] and it's put out there that you know it
[2:21:20] says david stripped off his clothes
[2:21:24] now let me make this i i want to touch
[2:21:27] on this real fast
[2:21:28] is that just always remember this
[2:21:32] the holy ghost
[2:21:34] will never make you do
[2:21:36] an unholy thing
[2:21:37] so with that in mind whenever you hear
[2:21:39] something
[2:21:41] right
[2:21:43] go double check it
[2:21:44] before we run off and gossip about it
[2:21:46] right
[2:21:47] um
[2:21:49] now when it says he's
[2:21:51] he removed his clothes
[2:21:54] it means he removed his kingly garments
[2:21:58] his garments of status before the people
[2:22:01] because he was going to dance before the
[2:22:03] lord
[2:22:04] and he said before the lord ain't no
[2:22:06] king
[2:22:07] he's my king
[2:22:08] [Applause]
[2:22:09] so he removed his robes and he went out
[2:22:13] in his undergarment his under robe that
[2:22:16] made him just like everybody else
[2:22:20] and he said when we come to worship the
[2:22:22] lord
[2:22:23] we are all the same
[2:22:26] i just wanted to clarify that
[2:22:28] that's so you get the right picture in
[2:22:30] your mind because sometimes we get this
[2:22:32] you know you know as a little kid you're
[2:22:33] always you hear that david took off his
[2:22:35] clothing the next thing you know you
[2:22:36] think david's streaking down the street
[2:22:38] it wasn't the case
[2:22:40] because
[2:22:41] god the holy spirit
[2:22:44] will never make you do
[2:22:46] an unholy act
[2:22:48] that's why in these pentecostal revivals
[2:22:52] that brother random would go to
[2:22:54] where the people would scream
[2:22:57] and dance
[2:22:58] and kick over chairs and roll on the
[2:23:00] ground
[2:23:01] he said that's not the holy ghost now
[2:23:04] the holy ghost can make you shout holy
[2:23:06] ghost can make you dance and you might
[2:23:07] even knock over a chair or two
[2:23:10] but he said i went there and you see
[2:23:11] these sisters rolling on the ground and
[2:23:14] the dress is up
[2:23:16] higher than they should be
[2:23:18] he said that's not the holy ghost
[2:23:22] he said the holy ghost will never
[2:23:25] make you do
[2:23:26] an unholy act
[2:23:28] now you might do something that someone
[2:23:31] to them they're like that's not holy or
[2:23:34] that's not holy according to what i
[2:23:37] believe is holy well that doesn't really
[2:23:39] matter what matters if it's holy before
[2:23:41] the lord
[2:23:42] but ultimately whenever you hear
[2:23:44] something like that especially in
[2:23:45] scripture
[2:23:47] go double check it
[2:23:49] what did that really mean
[2:23:51] what did what really transpired because
[2:23:53] that helps you understand what's going
[2:23:55] on
[2:23:57] okay
[2:23:58] he had lost all self-style
[2:24:00] he removed his pre his his kingly
[2:24:02] garments
[2:24:04] he he set aside
[2:24:06] who he was
[2:24:08] his own
[2:24:10] he set aside all the people who would
[2:24:12] run before him and here comes david as
[2:24:14] if you read back in the scripture even
[2:24:16] before he was king
[2:24:18] when he would go to battle with saul
[2:24:20] it says he came back from battle
[2:24:22] and the women of the city
[2:24:25] ran before him saying saul has slain his
[2:24:28] thousands and david his ten thousands
[2:24:31] exalting david
[2:24:33] which is what drove saul's jealousy
[2:24:35] right here he is he's the king he fought
[2:24:37] in the same battle with david and the
[2:24:39] first thing he comes back to isn't
[2:24:42] we're so happy to see you king
[2:24:44] but this little usurper behind him
[2:24:48] is getting all the praise i mean he got
[2:24:50] a little praise
[2:24:52] but it should have been he he's like
[2:24:55] i slew as many as david i think i slew
[2:24:57] more
[2:24:59] how can he be attributed for ten times
[2:25:00] as many as me
[2:25:04] but here david said no no no
[2:25:07] this moment is all the lords
[2:25:11] he had lost all cell style in the muck
[2:25:14] of the world
[2:25:15] he set it all aside
[2:25:18] he said the inoculation's worth it how
[2:25:19] it'll make me act
[2:25:22] he was so happy
[2:25:25] to know that the ark was coming into his
[2:25:28] own city
[2:25:30] he was so excited
[2:25:31] that representation of god himself
[2:25:35] was coming to reside with him
[2:25:39] and that's how we should be
[2:25:41] every day
[2:25:43] when we wake up and realize that that
[2:25:45] representation
[2:25:47] of god himself
[2:25:49] the holy spirit himself
[2:25:52] the person
[2:25:54] is coming to reside in your city
[2:25:57] in your gates in your heart
[2:26:00] as we strip it away say lord i'm nothing
[2:26:03] let it be all you that the glory be to
[2:26:06] all to you
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:09] that should be our reaction
[2:26:12] oh
[2:26:13] i tell you some people are afraid to
[2:26:15] receive the holy ghost
[2:26:17] afraid they might speak with tongues
[2:26:19] they're afraid that somebody would say
[2:26:21] now he's one of them tongues guys
[2:26:23] now hold on
[2:26:24] they're afraid to come to the church
[2:26:28] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[2:26:30] christ
[2:26:31] because they're ashamed of it
[2:26:35] they're willing to come to church
[2:26:39] they're willing to sit in here
[2:26:42] they're willing to sit wherever whatever
[2:26:43] church it is it doesn't have to be this
[2:26:45] church
[2:26:46] it could be a home church it could be a
[2:26:47] few people gathered together
[2:26:50] where the presence of the lord comes
[2:26:52] down
[2:26:55] they like to feel the presence
[2:26:57] they like the rain that comes down and
[2:26:59] waters their life
[2:27:03] but they don't want to make no
[2:27:04] commitment
[2:27:05] that's going to cause them to take that
[2:27:07] presence with them outside of the
[2:27:08] building
[2:27:10] because they're worried that if that
[2:27:11] presence follows with them wherever they
[2:27:14] go
[2:27:15] is they felt really good here in church
[2:27:17] and there's no struggle here in church
[2:27:21] there's very limited struggle
[2:27:24] very limited temptation
[2:27:28] but when i go out here
[2:27:30] i don't want to feel condemned all the
[2:27:32] time
[2:27:34] by that presence sitting there next to
[2:27:36] me
[2:27:37] where every little thing i'm like
[2:27:40] lord
[2:27:41] i'm sorry
[2:27:43] i thought that thought i did you know
[2:27:46] we don't want that we don't want that
[2:27:48] thing following us wherever we go
[2:27:51] so if we don't make a commitment well
[2:27:53] guess what
[2:27:55] we can come in amongst the children of
[2:27:57] god
[2:27:58] and they all bring their elixir fire
[2:27:59] with them
[2:28:01] and we can sit there
[2:28:03] and
[2:28:04] you know brother branham said
[2:28:06] that
[2:28:08] an evil spirit on somebody
[2:28:10] can be felt for five rows back and five
[2:28:14] rows forward
[2:28:15] okay now i don't say that to putting
[2:28:18] any type of
[2:28:21] um glorification or any type of
[2:28:23] attention to that spirit but that's an
[2:28:25] evil spirit
[2:28:27] now imagine
[2:28:28] the holy spirit
[2:28:31] okay
[2:28:32] so if each of you brings the holy spirit
[2:28:34] with you
[2:28:35] this is a pretty small church we only
[2:28:37] got about five rows
[2:28:39] is that all it takes is one holy
[2:28:41] spirit-filled person drawing on god and
[2:28:43] the presence of god will come down to
[2:28:44] fill this whole building
[2:28:47] and anyone who walks in that door will
[2:28:49] know something's different
[2:28:53] but it's a personal choice when you exit
[2:28:55] the doors whether you take that presence
[2:28:57] with you
[2:28:58] you know we sing the song take the name
[2:29:01] of jesus with you
[2:29:06] and it goes on
[2:29:08] most of us sing it but we don't mean it
[2:29:12] because if you take his name with you
[2:29:14] then everything you do you have to do in
[2:29:15] his name
[2:29:18] and if it's contrary to the gospel you
[2:29:21] can't do it in his name and so now when
[2:29:23] you come to that thing that's contrary
[2:29:25] you hit a wall
[2:29:27] and now you have to make the decision
[2:29:29] am i going to press on without his name
[2:29:32] or am i going to not do it to stay with
[2:29:34] his name
[2:29:38] so it's an inoculation choice
[2:29:42] and you know though we've already
[2:29:43] decided that once you've accepted the
[2:29:46] inoculation you don't do anything else
[2:29:48] in fact you can never get rid of it
[2:29:52] so that's why so many people don't even
[2:29:54] want to accept it
[2:29:56] because once i accept it if i wander out
[2:29:58] here i can't help but take his name with
[2:30:00] me because it's a part of me now
[2:30:02] i can't separate me from him brother
[2:30:04] talks about it and i believe it's in
[2:30:06] lamb and the dove
[2:30:08] is he says that lamb
[2:30:11] right
[2:30:12] the dove hovers over him and comes
[2:30:14] settle on him but
[2:30:16] if you do something contrary that double
[2:30:18] just take its flight and land off on a
[2:30:19] branch sitting right there
[2:30:21] it hasn't gone very far
[2:30:23] it's just not on sitting there with you
[2:30:25] you don't feel its presence
[2:30:28] you see but once you receive that
[2:30:30] inoculation that dove goes with you
[2:30:32] everywhere
[2:30:33] you can't get away from it
[2:30:35] david said though i go into the depths
[2:30:37] of hell you are there
[2:30:39] it's like
[2:30:41] no matter how far i run
[2:30:44] once you have accepted that
[2:30:49] it's done
[2:30:50] because you've accepted his promise
[2:30:54] and once he makes a promise it can't be
[2:30:56] broken
[2:30:57] he said i'll never leave you
[2:30:59] i'll never forsake you
[2:31:02] and it didn't have a
[2:31:03] time period or if you do this or if you
[2:31:05] do that and there's some clauses in here
[2:31:08] and fine prints so make sure you read
[2:31:09] that part
[2:31:12] no once it's done it's done
[2:31:19] he's just waiting for you to accept it
[2:31:26] but that's why so many don't want to
[2:31:29] we hang back
[2:31:31] you know even that's why you know
[2:31:33] right now it probably feels like i'm
[2:31:35] really concentrating on those who
[2:31:37] haven't received christ
[2:31:39] but even there's those of us who go
[2:31:40] through stages and points in our life
[2:31:42] where
[2:31:44] you know maybe the best way to describe
[2:31:45] it would be dry spells you know we got
[2:31:48] caught up with life and everything and
[2:31:50] and we lose that joy we lose that
[2:31:54] even some of that desire
[2:31:56] right
[2:31:58] because we're not partaking we're not
[2:32:00] constantly partaking
[2:32:03] you know how it is it's like sometimes
[2:32:04] you'll have a current favorite food
[2:32:06] right
[2:32:08] and the more you eat of it the more you
[2:32:09] want it but maybe for a short period of
[2:32:12] time
[2:32:13] there's none of it available
[2:32:15] and you lose a little bit of that taste
[2:32:17] for it for the period of time you don't
[2:32:18] have it
[2:32:19] and the longer the way from it you don't
[2:32:21] think about it
[2:32:22] but if you ever come back to it
[2:32:24] all that memory of how much you liked it
[2:32:26] comes flooding back
[2:32:28] and that's where a lot of us are at
[2:32:30] at times in our life
[2:32:33] is we've received the inoculation
[2:32:36] we've received the baptism of the holy
[2:32:37] ghost
[2:32:38] but maybe we're in that little bit of a
[2:32:40] dry spell where we haven't tasted and
[2:32:42] seen that the lord is good recently
[2:32:46] now not to say that we're not recipients
[2:32:48] of that because god continues to bless
[2:32:50] you despite yourself
[2:32:52] he he can't help it he promised it once
[2:32:54] he makes a promise he can't break his
[2:32:56] promise
[2:32:58] but we
[2:33:00] aren't paying attention
[2:33:01] we're not watching we're not staying
[2:33:03] sensitive to the moving of the spirit
[2:33:06] you know maybe it is maybe we have been
[2:33:08] through some hard things in life
[2:33:10] maybe you've had multiple people pass
[2:33:12] away
[2:33:13] maybe you've had things that make you
[2:33:15] question
[2:33:16] you say lord how could these things
[2:33:18] happen
[2:33:19] you being a good god
[2:33:21] there isn't anyone i would say you you
[2:33:23] would be hard-pressed admit
[2:33:25] maybe not but i would say most of us
[2:33:27] would be hard-pressed to say we've never
[2:33:29] been that place at least once in our
[2:33:31] life
[2:33:32] lord
[2:33:33] why is this happening to me
[2:33:35] what did i do
[2:33:39] why if you're a good god
[2:33:41] and and all things are supposed to work
[2:33:44] for the good
[2:33:46] well many of us misinterpret that you
[2:33:47] forget it says work for the good it
[2:33:49] doesn't say everything will be good
[2:33:53] and you go
[2:33:55] why why
[2:33:56] and sometimes we find ourselves in the
[2:33:58] same place brother branham did
[2:33:59] and if you don't remember the story
[2:34:02] is he had gone to pray for
[2:34:05] i think it was a young woman
[2:34:09] and she was ill he went to pray for her
[2:34:11] he prayed for her and she
[2:34:14] died now he had prayed for many people
[2:34:18] he'd seen the the cripples walk and the
[2:34:20] blind eyes come open and this was not so
[2:34:23] vast a different disease or illness that
[2:34:27] he'd never seen that happen he went and
[2:34:29] prayed and the lady died
[2:34:32] and when he when the lady died he said
[2:34:34] god
[2:34:34] you owe me an answer
[2:34:37] if you're a good god
[2:34:39] if if if all things are supposed to work
[2:34:42] out and i prayed the prayer of faith he
[2:34:44] said the prayer of faith will heal the
[2:34:46] sick
[2:34:47] i prayed the prayer of faith and she
[2:34:49] died anyways
[2:34:51] you owe me an answer
[2:34:53] well you know what happened
[2:34:55] he said he didn't speak to me for six
[2:34:58] months that's right sister heaven
[2:35:00] six months this is the prophet of god
[2:35:04] the prophet of this age
[2:35:06] who is supposed to be growing to the
[2:35:07] point of a revelation to bring something
[2:35:09] to the people
[2:35:13] he didn't speak to him for six months
[2:35:15] and you know what even after six months
[2:35:17] it wasn't god's like okay fine i've
[2:35:19] punished you enough
[2:35:22] no
[2:35:23] brother branham said
[2:35:25] after six months of not hearing anything
[2:35:27] he got desperate
[2:35:29] he said lord forgive me i you don't owe
[2:35:31] me nothing
[2:35:35] and it was then god said okay now that
[2:35:37] you realize i don't owe you nothing now
[2:35:39] i'll tell you why that happened
[2:35:42] he said
[2:35:43] she was in a drowning accident so many
[2:35:46] years ago and should have that was her
[2:35:48] time she should have died then but she
[2:35:50] wasn't ready
[2:35:53] and i spared her life then
[2:35:55] but now all this time she's made her
[2:35:57] heart right
[2:35:58] and this was just the thing that called
[2:36:00] her home
[2:36:05] but many of us have been there
[2:36:07] we've questioned god because we're human
[2:36:10] where our humanity gets in our way
[2:36:13] we see things in a very finite way in
[2:36:16] ways in regards to time and matter and
[2:36:18] space and all these god is looking at
[2:36:21] things from an eternal point viewpoint
[2:36:23] he's like
[2:36:24] what was done was what needed to be done
[2:36:26] was done and
[2:36:28] it your work is over it doesn't matter
[2:36:29] to me how you come home
[2:36:32] you know many churches and places put
[2:36:34] put a real emphasis on how you die on
[2:36:37] whether or not god was pleased with you
[2:36:40] you know that then that really a lot of
[2:36:41] it comes from even the catholic church
[2:36:44] because by doing that they could
[2:36:47] influence people and hold more fear over
[2:36:49] the people
[2:36:51] but
[2:36:53] from the beginning of time god has let
[2:36:55] his people come home however they come
[2:36:57] home when their work here is done
[2:37:00] yeah we know brother branham talks about
[2:37:02] the people but people who passed away in
[2:37:04] their sleep and that's just a lovely way
[2:37:06] to go and that just you know
[2:37:08] god letting them do that and just slip
[2:37:10] off and
[2:37:11] away they go
[2:37:14] but
[2:37:16] from tragic ways of going to ways that
[2:37:18] we would think unthinkable
[2:37:20] think of saul
[2:37:23] king saul
[2:37:28] committed
[2:37:30] suicide he killed himself with his own
[2:37:33] sword and he was not terminally ill he
[2:37:37] hadn't he had been hit by an arrow and
[2:37:39] he was losing the battle
[2:37:41] and he realized i'm losing and i don't
[2:37:43] want to be killed by one of the enemy
[2:37:46] because that will look bad on me
[2:37:49] and i have a i have pride and
[2:37:51] self-respect as the king to uphold here
[2:37:54] ain't no one else going to kill me i'll
[2:37:56] kill myself
[2:37:58] he didn't he didn't put into there he
[2:38:00] didn't think lord
[2:38:01] despite all of this you can still
[2:38:03] protect me
[2:38:05] he didn't even go down that road
[2:38:10] but we know he was saved because when he
[2:38:13] went to the witch of endor
[2:38:15] the night before
[2:38:16] okay he's already sunk so low god's not
[2:38:18] talking to him
[2:38:20] it's so
[2:38:22] far blown and he's done horrible things
[2:38:25] he killed the servants of god the priest
[2:38:28] out of a fit of anger
[2:38:31] and here because god's not talking to
[2:38:33] him no more
[2:38:35] by any of the ways he's used to so he
[2:38:37] goes to a witch you know king saul is
[2:38:40] the one who almost eradicated all the
[2:38:42] witches in israel
[2:38:45] so here he is
[2:38:46] he is the
[2:38:49] you know the the the hero
[2:38:51] he is the the knight the in shining
[2:38:54] armor he is the one who has almost
[2:38:56] stomped this thing out
[2:38:58] his name is known amongst all the people
[2:39:00] who practice the dark arts
[2:39:02] if you see king saul go coming run for
[2:39:05] your life
[2:39:06] he is god's vegeta in action
[2:39:10] and here he is at the very end
[2:39:12] going back to one of these people that
[2:39:14] he was the greatest persecutor of
[2:39:17] and he goes and he disguises himself
[2:39:19] that's how low he had sunk
[2:39:22] right
[2:39:25] and
[2:39:26] at that time because it was before the
[2:39:28] time of the cross before captivity had
[2:39:31] been set free
[2:39:33] captivity taken captive and and and they
[2:39:35] had changed that different into that
[2:39:37] other dimension then when the witch
[2:39:40] calls up samuel she doesn't know who
[2:39:41] stalls in because he's snuck in in the
[2:39:43] middle of the night
[2:39:45] and somehow they found her
[2:39:48] and
[2:39:49] he's so desperate to know what's going
[2:39:51] to happen the next day
[2:39:55] and she calls up samuel
[2:39:57] from the dead
[2:39:59] and samuel comes up out of the grave
[2:40:02] and he's there he is he stands before
[2:40:05] saul
[2:40:06] he said he still looked like an old man
[2:40:08] at that time
[2:40:10] because it was before the the time of
[2:40:12] the resurrection
[2:40:14] and he says saul
[2:40:17] tomorrow by this time you will be with
[2:40:21] me
[2:40:22] in paradise
[2:40:24] he say saul by this time tomorrow you'll
[2:40:26] be in hell
[2:40:28] he said by this time tomorrow
[2:40:31] you'll be with me in paradise
[2:40:37] okay
[2:40:38] and we know brother branham specifically
[2:40:40] speaks on if you didn't know that go
[2:40:41] back study it through the message look
[2:40:43] it up look all the quotes on saul
[2:40:46] he had fulfilled
[2:40:48] his part of scripture and the types and
[2:40:51] shadows he was meant to fulfill
[2:40:53] for the future he was the rejected king
[2:40:58] rejected by the people and god
[2:41:00] just like jesus on the cross
[2:41:03] you know everyone types jesus to david
[2:41:06] but david was never a rejected king well
[2:41:08] he was once but not in the same way it
[2:41:11] didn't take him all the way to his own
[2:41:12] death and fall on his own sword
[2:41:15] jesus did
[2:41:17] we know that
[2:41:20] because when pilate said you do not know
[2:41:22] that i have power
[2:41:25] to take your life he said you have no
[2:41:27] power but what i give you but what my
[2:41:30] father gives you
[2:41:32] so he had to fall on his own
[2:41:34] sword the word
[2:41:38] to pay for our sins
[2:41:41] you see saul had a part of his life
[2:41:44] had to be a perfect type
[2:41:48] and god knew that
[2:41:50] it was had to be in the scripture
[2:41:53] it had to be there
[2:41:58] and that's why
[2:41:59] we look at things and we see people's
[2:42:01] lives and we're like
[2:42:02] [Music]
[2:42:03] ain't never seen them again
[2:42:06] they're done they're over they've passed
[2:42:09] on they had a chance but their chance is
[2:42:12] done
[2:42:13] well i tell you saints
[2:42:15] i am so glad
[2:42:18] that i serve a god of grace and mercy
[2:42:21] both in this life and the other side of
[2:42:23] the grave
[2:42:26] if not i don't know how i'd make it
[2:42:29] all right
[2:42:31] i think i
[2:42:32] went off on the side there but
[2:42:38] but that's a good thing to think about
[2:42:41] is you know david
[2:42:43] who was driven from israel by saul
[2:42:45] hunted like a dog
[2:42:48] the enemy after they found saul's body
[2:42:51] took it and defiled it in their city
[2:42:54] and david heard about it
[2:42:57] a messenger came to him who thought he
[2:42:59] would rejoice over the saul's death
[2:43:02] and here once again we see the life and
[2:43:04] spirit of christ rise up
[2:43:08] and not only did he put the man who
[2:43:10] brought that news to him to death
[2:43:12] because he thought he would be rewarded
[2:43:15] because he actually took
[2:43:17] he took
[2:43:18] responsibility for saul's death because
[2:43:20] he thought he said here i brought you
[2:43:23] saul's crown so you can take it and and
[2:43:26] claim the kingship yourself
[2:43:28] and i'm the one who killed him
[2:43:30] he said aha
[2:43:32] look at that no one knows any different
[2:43:34] i'll be rewarded maybe he'll make me
[2:43:36] general of his armies
[2:43:39] david said how dare you
[2:43:42] how dare you
[2:43:44] touch a a hair
[2:43:46] of the head
[2:43:47] of one of god's anointed because it
[2:43:50] didn't matter what had happened through
[2:43:51] saul's life or what he had sunk to
[2:43:54] he had been anointed by god almighty as
[2:43:56] king over israel until god called him
[2:43:59] home
[2:44:00] even in his
[2:44:02] in his rebellious state
[2:44:04] david said
[2:44:05] that anointing is still on him
[2:44:08] till the day he dies and i'll respect it
[2:44:11] that's why he fled before the king
[2:44:13] instead of turning to fight the king
[2:44:17] and when that happened and he heard of
[2:44:19] it
[2:44:19] he wept
[2:44:21] he mourned
[2:44:22] and then
[2:44:24] with possible bodily injury and harm to
[2:44:27] him and his own men who followed him who
[2:44:30] had been chased by king saul all over
[2:44:32] the countryside for years
[2:44:35] they went
[2:44:36] and honored that man
[2:44:39] by bringing his body down
[2:44:41] and taking it back
[2:44:43] and burying it
[2:44:44] correctly you see
[2:44:47] it didn't hold a grudge didn't say you
[2:44:49] see that
[2:44:50] look at what the hell that man's life
[2:44:52] was and how he lived he deserved that
[2:44:55] he got what he deserved
[2:44:59] many of us would have gone and we would
[2:45:01] have gone to the city to get the the
[2:45:02] body in the head well it wouldn't be to
[2:45:04] show it on her
[2:45:06] we would have paraded it before all
[2:45:07] everyone else look at my enemy
[2:45:09] he's dead
[2:45:11] david didn't do that
[2:45:14] because it was the life of christ even
[2:45:15] back then before the holy ghost
[2:45:19] influencing the life of the believer
[2:45:24] all right
[2:45:30] i just got one or two more things i want
[2:45:32] to share with you i'm going to wrap that
[2:45:33] up
[2:45:35] you know saints
[2:45:37] it's
[2:45:40] not how much we study
[2:45:44] it's not how many quotes we have
[2:45:48] it's not how long we can minister
[2:45:51] it's not how short we can minister
[2:45:52] either
[2:45:54] and don't don't get confused there
[2:45:57] just because it was real short doesn't
[2:45:58] make it real good it's because it was
[2:46:00] real long to make it real good
[2:46:02] but it's about
[2:46:04] being sensitive to the moving of the
[2:46:06] holy spirit
[2:46:08] in your life in my life in a service
[2:46:12] when you sing a song
[2:46:15] is god moving and how is he moving where
[2:46:17] is he going
[2:46:18] what is he doing
[2:46:21] now we've talked about it we know the
[2:46:23] cure
[2:46:25] we know it's accepting jesus christ as
[2:46:27] your personal lord and savior
[2:46:30] we know it's going through the steps of
[2:46:32] justification sanctification
[2:46:35] baptism of the holy ghost until that
[2:46:37] indwelling of the person himself christ
[2:46:40] is so
[2:46:41] takes seat in your heart
[2:46:44] that you are
[2:46:45] like david you've set aside your
[2:46:47] priestly ro your kingly robes that
[2:46:49] identify you as who you are and you just
[2:46:52] identify as jesus christ
[2:46:55] he said brother branham said it will
[2:46:56] come to a place it should come to a
[2:46:58] place in your life
[2:47:00] where they stop and look again
[2:47:02] and they go is that him
[2:47:05] and i don't mean is that for the jordans
[2:47:06] that but steve's that
[2:47:08] sister
[2:47:09] faith stern naomi's joy
[2:47:12] but they go is that is that is that
[2:47:14] jesus
[2:47:16] did he just walk by
[2:47:19] because that was the
[2:47:21] example we had of this wave chief that
[2:47:24] came before us a prophet
[2:47:27] he got such to a place
[2:47:29] where even though the denominations
[2:47:31] looked at him said we don't believe what
[2:47:33] you preach one bit
[2:47:36] but there's no denying
[2:47:39] that no one
[2:47:42] expresses
[2:47:43] the love and life of christ
[2:47:45] like you do
[2:47:47] we can't say anything about your life
[2:47:50] and that's what we're walking to
[2:47:53] but we always we we
[2:47:56] how would you put it we
[2:47:59] dramatize it in a way to ourselves so
[2:48:01] many times in in a way that looks good
[2:48:03] to us
[2:48:07] but we don't consider the cost
[2:48:09] because there is a cost
[2:48:11] you will have to give up of yourself
[2:48:13] you have to set aside your own ambitions
[2:48:16] your own self-importance your own
[2:48:18] self-righteousness
[2:48:20] and you think oh that's not too much to
[2:48:21] give up you'd be surprised
[2:48:24] you'd be surprised how much you've lived
[2:48:26] with that how much that's become a part
[2:48:27] of who you think you are
[2:48:30] even even to a point you know where
[2:48:33] people we get angry with people or
[2:48:35] something
[2:48:36] someone will do something in a certain
[2:48:38] way and we want to make it right
[2:48:41] it's a principle the matter is the term
[2:48:43] that's used right
[2:48:45] it's about doing the right thing while
[2:48:47] sometimes doing the right thing is
[2:48:48] turning the other cheek
[2:48:51] it's not about correcting the other
[2:48:53] person let god do it
[2:48:57] he'll correct them don't you worry about
[2:48:59] it
[2:49:00] now not to say that you know we you know
[2:49:02] don't don't throw it all out
[2:49:03] scripture does tell us if you see a
[2:49:05] brother that's doing something that they
[2:49:06] shouldn't
[2:49:07] go to them in in love
[2:49:10] but if you can't go to them in love
[2:49:11] don't go
[2:49:15] you're just going there you're you're
[2:49:17] going there self righteously
[2:49:18] i caught you
[2:49:20] and i got something over you now
[2:49:22] that's what you're doing
[2:49:24] love goes brother i saw you doing this
[2:49:26] and
[2:49:27] and i just want to pray for you and and
[2:49:29] and see what are you is there something
[2:49:31] you're going through in your life that's
[2:49:33] that you're struggling with how can i
[2:49:34] help you
[2:49:36] it's not
[2:49:37] to bring the the
[2:49:38] um
[2:49:40] the uh
[2:49:42] the word escapes me the
[2:49:44] inquisition out
[2:49:46] you know that's really what most of this
[2:49:48] has turned into
[2:49:49] is
[2:49:50] it's empowered people to run their own
[2:49:53] inquisitions
[2:49:56] where they can fry people and and tie
[2:49:58] them to a stake and lash them with their
[2:50:00] own thoughts and opinions and what they
[2:50:02] think the word says
[2:50:05] but that's not what that scripture was
[2:50:07] about ever
[2:50:10] it was go to them in love
[2:50:13] and see how can i help them
[2:50:15] rise up out of that condition
[2:50:18] even the next part
[2:50:20] is not so much because you're looking to
[2:50:22] shame them where you bring the elders of
[2:50:24] the church
[2:50:25] you're bringing reinforcements out of
[2:50:26] love
[2:50:29] you're trying to see what you can do
[2:50:31] and even if you get all the way to the
[2:50:33] point
[2:50:36] in the scripture it says well
[2:50:38] bring them before the church
[2:50:40] and
[2:50:40] and
[2:50:42] take and release their flesh
[2:50:46] to the devil
[2:50:48] and it doesn't say anything about
[2:50:50] removing their salvation
[2:50:53] right
[2:50:54] but that's how many of men churches and
[2:50:57] organizations have have treated it
[2:50:59] is
[2:51:00] we can take you out
[2:51:02] no you can't
[2:51:03] all you're doing
[2:51:05] is out of love
[2:51:08] it's not out of trying to control
[2:51:10] somebody out of love you're saying out
[2:51:13] of love we have to remove our seal of
[2:51:16] protection from this church from you
[2:51:19] so that god can come in and work on your
[2:51:21] life what i mean by that is you know
[2:51:24] brother ram said you even need to be
[2:51:25] careful sometimes what you pray for
[2:51:28] for people
[2:51:30] now don't use that as a weapon either
[2:51:32] you know you got to watch out for our
[2:51:34] humanity because we do it i'm not going
[2:51:35] to pray for them i don't know what god's
[2:51:36] trying to do for them
[2:51:39] come on
[2:51:40] stop it
[2:51:42] but
[2:51:43] but as long as they are a part of this
[2:51:45] assembly and under the prayers of the
[2:51:47] church
[2:51:49] even god himself there's some things he
[2:51:51] can't do
[2:51:54] because he has to honor his own word
[2:51:57] so that's why
[2:51:58] you remove the protection of the church
[2:52:01] but god's it's not removing god's
[2:52:03] protection
[2:52:05] god can do what he wants
[2:52:08] but it's allowing god to come down and
[2:52:09] work personally with that individual to
[2:52:12] do whatever needs to happen to bring
[2:52:14] them back
[2:52:15] but if any of those stages can't be done
[2:52:17] out of the love of god
[2:52:19] then you are you are not the right
[2:52:21] person or you are not the right persons
[2:52:23] to be doing it
[2:52:25] and that's just the truth
[2:52:26] now we talked about
[2:52:32] when that holy spirit comes down in your
[2:52:35] life
[2:52:36] something to think about not something
[2:52:38] to look at someone else and say whether
[2:52:39] or not i know if you have it but desmond
[2:52:43] or you to say whether you know i have it
[2:52:45] but here's something for you to look at
[2:52:47] and think about to know
[2:52:49] do i have it is it active in my life
[2:52:53] am i continuing to grow in christ and i
[2:52:56] have
[2:52:56] three quotes i want to read to you
[2:53:00] and i think it's so important
[2:53:03] i know that sometimes we get into those
[2:53:05] dry places we talked about
[2:53:07] and even when we come into the presence
[2:53:09] of lord
[2:53:10] there's things that we're
[2:53:13] working through our current
[2:53:15] situations or current habits that we
[2:53:18] just don't want to let go of
[2:53:20] but we know if we let ourself go into
[2:53:22] the presence of god we won't be able to
[2:53:24] help but that thing will just be removed
[2:53:26] from your life and so you fight it
[2:53:28] right
[2:53:29] you really do
[2:53:31] because if you didn't fight it it would
[2:53:33] just be gone
[2:53:34] god will just
[2:53:35] take it from you
[2:53:37] but we fight it because we're like ah i
[2:53:39] kind of like it
[2:53:41] it's not that bad a thing
[2:53:45] you know
[2:53:46] who who is anyone else to judge
[2:53:50] but we're judging ourselves we know
[2:53:52] what's going on
[2:53:53] no one else may know but we know and god
[2:53:56] knows
[2:53:57] he comes and he uses the ministry to
[2:53:59] speak to your heart and the presence of
[2:54:01] god comes through the building and and
[2:54:03] moves and you feel it and you you're
[2:54:05] like oh
[2:54:06] that's so nice that's good
[2:54:08] and then you're almost that point where
[2:54:09] you're about to break through and you're
[2:54:10] like
[2:54:11] [Music]
[2:54:13] no i want to live with this thing a
[2:54:14] little bit longer you know there was a
[2:54:15] brother who once preached a message one
[2:54:17] more night with the frogs
[2:54:20] and it was about pharaoh because when
[2:54:22] moses went to pharaoh
[2:54:24] pharaoh called moses because he had the
[2:54:25] plague of frogs
[2:54:28] and moses said okay
[2:54:31] well the frogs will be gone when do you
[2:54:32] want them gone and pharaoh said well how
[2:54:35] about tomorrow
[2:54:36] tomorrow morning by tomorrow morning
[2:54:39] he could have said i want him gone right
[2:54:41] now
[2:54:42] right now
[2:54:43] and moses said okay
[2:54:45] gone
[2:54:46] frog's gone plague over
[2:54:50] he said one more night
[2:54:53] one more night with the frogs i like
[2:54:54] them a little bit
[2:54:56] and that's where many of us are at
[2:54:58] we have things in our lives where we're
[2:54:59] like
[2:55:00] god's like well when do you want me to
[2:55:02] live or deliver you from that thing and
[2:55:04] we're like well
[2:55:05] how about next week
[2:55:06] i got something i really want to do and
[2:55:08] if i get delivered
[2:55:10] i won't be able to do it and i've been
[2:55:12] looking forward to doing it for the last
[2:55:13] six months
[2:55:15] me and my friends have been planning
[2:55:16] this
[2:55:17] you know
[2:55:18] so just one more week one more night
[2:55:21] and and then i want to be delivered
[2:55:24] let's
[2:55:26] if god ask you when you want to be
[2:55:28] livered right now right now i want to be
[2:55:30] delivered
[2:55:32] so
[2:55:35] in the fifth seal
[2:55:37] oh i love this
[2:55:40] now this is the fifth seal
[2:55:43] where brother madam is
[2:55:45] coming and he's ministering
[2:55:47] and every single day
[2:55:50] the angel of the lord has been coming
[2:55:52] down to him right before the service
[2:55:54] he's studying all day long right but
[2:55:56] right before the service the lord comes
[2:55:58] down to him and every time he says if he
[2:56:00] hadn't come down i would have had it all
[2:56:02] wrong every single time
[2:56:04] that just shows us where some of us are
[2:56:06] at we know we study and we study and we
[2:56:08] study and i'm not saying don't study
[2:56:10] but i'm saying sometimes we do that and
[2:56:12] we think we got this great revelation
[2:56:15] and then the lord comes down and begins
[2:56:17] to anoint it
[2:56:19] and we get really upset sometimes
[2:56:22] because now that revelation is flowing
[2:56:24] we're like this is all wrong
[2:56:26] i wasted all my time and i just need it
[2:56:29] to be right so my time was worthwhile
[2:56:32] and that's luckily this is not the
[2:56:34] attitude we need we were like lord thank
[2:56:36] you for saving me from saying something
[2:56:38] so
[2:56:38] stupid or acting on something new and i
[2:56:41] shouldn't
[2:56:43] and he says
[2:56:44] oh i love this
[2:56:46] it's just the beginning to feel
[2:56:47] religious right now see
[2:56:50] maybe the stimulation notice when the
[2:56:52] antichrist owe them them revelations and
[2:56:55] the presence of that ball of fire
[2:56:57] hanging there in the room he's talking
[2:56:58] about that angel coming down and
[2:56:59] speaking to him
[2:57:01] that ball of fire in the room
[2:57:03] right
[2:57:05] now it's the same ball of fire that had
[2:57:07] been coming to him since he was a child
[2:57:09] same ball of fire they'd stand next to
[2:57:11] him on the platform
[2:57:14] okay
[2:57:14] he'd been experiencing this for the last
[2:57:16] 20 plus years
[2:57:19] 20 years
[2:57:21] and yet this still his response
[2:57:24] to an encounter with this ball of fire
[2:57:28] oh brother
[2:57:30] a fire hanging there in the room to oh
[2:57:31] brother although i've seen it since a
[2:57:34] child
[2:57:35] every time it comes near me it alarms me
[2:57:39] the fear of god
[2:57:40] this drops into the room
[2:57:43] that that awesome presence
[2:57:47] he almost puts me in an unconscious
[2:57:50] condition
[2:57:53] you never get used to it
[2:57:59] you can't it's too
[2:58:02] sacred
[2:58:04] and i say this as a challenge to each
[2:58:07] and every one of us at whatever walk
[2:58:09] stage of our walk we are in
[2:58:12] is use this
[2:58:16] to
[2:58:16] gauge where you're at
[2:58:19] in your sensitivity to the moving of the
[2:58:22] holy spirit
[2:58:24] not just in service
[2:58:26] but every single day
[2:58:29] is when he comes by to speak to you does
[2:58:32] it have this kind of effect
[2:58:34] or if we
[2:58:35] become hardened
[2:58:39] by the life that we're living
[2:58:41] or the things that we're doing
[2:58:44] that were resistant to the sensitivity
[2:58:47] of the spirit
[2:58:49] because here brother branham you say
[2:58:51] i've been through
[2:58:52] hard tough things right
[2:58:54] well let's see here
[2:58:57] as a child his dad was the equivalent of
[2:58:59] the local drug lord
[2:59:03] and he forced his son
[2:59:05] to be a part of the operation
[2:59:07] as he cried and cried and cried and he
[2:59:10] called him a boy
[2:59:13] his dad was a murderer
[2:59:16] known that's why they moved they had to
[2:59:18] move states crossed state lines back
[2:59:20] then
[2:59:21] because if you did you could
[2:59:23] it wasn't as organized as things are
[2:59:24] today
[2:59:26] his dad murdered somebody
[2:59:29] was the local drug lord
[2:59:33] he was forced to be a part of the
[2:59:34] operation
[2:59:36] the name
[2:59:37] the branham name in the towns and cities
[2:59:39] and areas they lived in was so low
[2:59:42] people
[2:59:42] would cross
[2:59:44] to the other side of the street if he
[2:59:47] not his dad but he as a child was
[2:59:50] walking down the street just to not walk
[2:59:52] next to him
[2:59:55] okay
[2:59:56] and here we keep moving ready
[2:59:58] right just just in case that still isn't
[3:00:01] enough trials tribulations and things to
[3:00:04] harden your spirit
[3:00:06] right
[3:00:07] some of us were like we've been through
[3:00:08] a lot you don't know what i've been
[3:00:11] through
[3:00:13] situations i've faced that's why i don't
[3:00:15] show no emotion
[3:00:17] ever before anyone you god
[3:00:21] i just it's in here
[3:00:24] right
[3:00:26] okay we move on
[3:00:28] he actually
[3:00:29] god moves on his life
[3:00:32] and
[3:00:34] he gets saved
[3:00:36] he gets married
[3:00:39] and the first thing that happens
[3:00:42] is he's in a tragic
[3:00:44] situation where he's in a storm he's out
[3:00:46] helping people
[3:00:48] in the storm
[3:00:50] and in the midst of this storm while
[3:00:52] helping people
[3:00:54] his wife
[3:00:56] dies
[3:00:59] next thing that happens is he gets
[3:01:02] rushed told that his wife has died and
[3:01:04] his daughter is dying
[3:01:06] he gets rushed to the hospital
[3:01:10] and the doctor who's a friend of him
[3:01:11] tells him you shouldn't even go in there
[3:01:13] she's dying as we speak
[3:01:15] he walks in he stands there
[3:01:18] and he watch
[3:01:19] her gasp her last breath
[3:01:22] while praying and praying and praying
[3:01:25] for god to save him
[3:01:27] her
[3:01:28] and if you if you know or you've ever
[3:01:30] listened to life story go back listen to
[3:01:32] it again
[3:01:35] or if you've never read it the the the
[3:01:36] series that owen jorgensen wrote on his
[3:01:38] life it's a wonderful series he'll enjoy
[3:01:40] it
[3:01:42] but he says he's there praying
[3:01:44] and he feels like it's a black sheep
[3:01:47] comes down between him
[3:01:49] and god
[3:01:51] just
[3:01:53] no audible anything no explanations
[3:01:56] just a
[3:01:58] big giant no
[3:02:01] and she dies
[3:02:06] you just keep going on
[3:02:08] you know he suffered with an illness
[3:02:11] that would lay him out cold
[3:02:14] all the way up until almost the end of
[3:02:15] his ministry
[3:02:19] pains in his body constantly
[3:02:21] situations
[3:02:23] due to it due to
[3:02:25] making a wrong decision when he was on
[3:02:27] the field god allowed him to catch an
[3:02:30] amoeba that almost killed him
[3:02:33] this is after he served the lord for
[3:02:35] many years
[3:02:37] he healed many people prayed for many
[3:02:40] people
[3:02:41] all around the
[3:02:42] world and yet
[3:02:45] here we come
[3:02:46] we're coming down to the end of his
[3:02:48] ministry he said everything that this
[3:02:50] was building up to
[3:02:52] and he said yet i've been through all
[3:02:53] that
[3:02:56] but he let people know they asked him he
[3:02:58] said
[3:02:59] dude has have you kept your religion
[3:03:01] billy
[3:03:02] he said no
[3:03:03] i haven't kept my religion
[3:03:06] he said my religions kept me
[3:03:08] when he said religion he just didn't
[3:03:09] mean a church or a thing they said
[3:03:12] almighty god
[3:03:13] in spite of all of this
[3:03:15] he's kept me
[3:03:17] and because of that
[3:03:19] when i feel his presence come down
[3:03:22] as that presence moves into the room
[3:03:24] it could be anywhere it could be in the
[3:03:26] room i could be standing outside
[3:03:29] you know there's a testimony where
[3:03:31] it says he would he was standing outside
[3:03:34] and he's felt the wind blow
[3:03:39] right
[3:03:41] most of us
[3:03:42] we feel and hear the wind blow all the
[3:03:43] time
[3:03:47] he's standing there and he takes his
[3:03:48] head off out of respect
[3:03:50] and he pauses and he says lord is that
[3:03:53] you
[3:03:54] it's not about the location
[3:03:57] it's never been about the location
[3:04:01] god's provided place to meet you is in
[3:04:04] jesus christ
[3:04:06] and that's all that matters
[3:04:09] okay
[3:04:10] last last two i promise
[3:04:13] now an expectation 1953
[3:04:16] i just want to provide you with multiple
[3:04:18] examples because i don't want to just
[3:04:19] use one
[3:04:22] right we don't ever want to just
[3:04:24] share one thing and say okay that's it
[3:04:27] i want to give you a little bit i want
[3:04:28] you to go search it out too
[3:04:30] go do that you owe it to yourself
[3:04:33] the prophet of god told the people all
[3:04:35] the time here he was a prophet of god he
[3:04:37] knew god was speaking lip to ear thus
[3:04:40] saith the lord and he still said you owe
[3:04:42] it to yourself
[3:04:44] to go back to the scripture the bible
[3:04:47] and on your knees
[3:04:49] and verify with god whether or not this
[3:04:51] that i am telling you is the truth
[3:04:57] now your subject
[3:04:59] you know that something is going on
[3:05:02] that won't hurt you this isn't a prayer
[3:05:04] line
[3:05:05] now that's just the holy spirit coming
[3:05:08] near here
[3:05:09] it's you've seen the picture of it a
[3:05:11] while ago that pillar of fire did you
[3:05:14] ever see it
[3:05:17] and in sirs would you see jesus
[3:05:26] now i want you to come just a little
[3:05:29] more near me because of the emotion at
[3:05:31] the platform
[3:05:32] well god's going to judge us both some
[3:05:34] of these days lady
[3:05:36] you're aware of that
[3:05:37] you're aware right now that you're
[3:05:39] standing in the presence of something
[3:05:40] besides a man
[3:05:42] and is that true
[3:05:44] now that won't hurt you
[3:05:45] that's that's some power that you say
[3:05:48] you feel moving in
[3:05:49] that's
[3:05:50] the angel of the lord
[3:05:54] that's
[3:05:55] the angel of the lord
[3:06:00] now
[3:06:04] the prophet's gone home
[3:06:07] he's been gone many years
[3:06:12] but
[3:06:18] it was a son of man
[3:06:20] coming to reveal the son of man
[3:06:24] and just like john the baptist
[3:06:26] when he left
[3:06:28] it wasn't the end
[3:06:30] it was christ's ministry
[3:06:32] taking place
[3:06:34] and that's where we stand today
[3:06:36] the prophet's going on but the angel of
[3:06:38] the lord is still here
[3:06:40] that same ball of fire
[3:06:42] comes and stands beside you
[3:06:47] if we just have to make a choice
[3:06:50] we have to make a choice for the
[3:06:51] inoculation that will cure us of sin
[3:06:55] we have to make a choice do we want that
[3:06:57] presence to travel with us
[3:06:59] we have to make a choice
[3:07:02] and he's a gentleman brother branham
[3:07:04] said over and over again musicians if
[3:07:06] you want to come
[3:07:07] he said he's a gentleman he'll never
[3:07:09] force himself on you
[3:07:11] he'll never force his presence on you
[3:07:12] he'll come around
[3:07:14] and he'll he'll see how you're doing
[3:07:17] he'll knock on the door
[3:07:20] he won't force it open
[3:07:22] he's waiting for you to open the door
[3:07:24] he's waiting for you to let him in you
[3:07:26] know that famous painting of
[3:07:29] that i'm sure everyone has seen at some
[3:07:31] point of jesus standing outside the door
[3:07:33] and knocking
[3:07:34] when it be before the hall of critics
[3:07:37] they said the only thing we find wrong
[3:07:38] with it
[3:07:40] is there's no
[3:07:41] knob there's no latch on the outside
[3:07:44] and the painter said no that's not a
[3:07:45] mistake
[3:07:46] so when jesus knocks on your door it has
[3:07:49] to be opened from the inside
[3:07:53] so we just have to make a choice
[3:07:55] are we going to open the door
[3:07:58] have we let him in
[3:08:00] i don't need that i'm just nervous
[3:08:05] where are we at saints
[3:08:08] the cure is there
[3:08:10] it's available
[3:08:12] unlimited dosages
[3:08:14] you don't have to wait
[3:08:16] you don't have to get in line
[3:08:18] you don't have to go to any particular
[3:08:20] clinic
[3:08:21] you just have to be willing
[3:08:25] are we willing tonight
[3:08:26] this morning
[3:08:28] here where we're at
[3:08:30] are we really wanting to take the name
[3:08:32] of jesus with us

[3:09:56] hearts father that
[3:09:58] that lord they would just seek
[3:10:01] for a little bit more of you father

[3:10:13] if something will have been said that
