TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you [Music] the Lord it's good to be in the house of God once again shall we say a word of Prayer our Lord and our Savior Jesus we thank you so much once again for bringing us together this morning for today's Sunday School we are trusting you Father for the next 30 minutes so good that in one way or the other father we are going to hear you speak we have now come to hear the enticing words of man's wisdom we have come dear Lord Jesus that we may hear from you that is why we will leave our homes further all God and get here we are so grateful Lord for having made it possible for us to be here we are trusting you father for those Wendy away coming now you bring them in safely also our Lord and our Savior Jesus our heart desire is to know you more and to serve you better than we have ever done because if we continue down the same path we are going to get the same results to have different results something different must happen something else we ought to do something Lord and this is why father oh god we believe day in day out as we got a before turn of grace that we will see the hand of God lifted up in oil in our midst and we are so grateful Lord that you are here for your word says so now where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the Amish bless us Lord and keep us by your mighty right hand even as European are I used to see that which you want us to see in Jesus name Amen praise God so um still on our Sunday school yeah so I'm sister you are warmly welcome for the next 30 minutes we have as children Sunday school and other Sunday school before the song service and administration of your word so that is all we are going to do for the next 30 minutes and you only have welcome to the house of God so we are looking at the subject tied in or tights I know somebody is going to be blessed you know when we're doing the prayer series every once in a while I will get some attacks here and there they didn't come to me as a surprise at all but for some reason since I started this teaching on tithing I will have two three fourth attacks in a week and my money Jay and I had a problem and I told him I was going to h-her and before I did that I said no let me go talk to his boss I wonder I spoke to his boss and he said you know what let's talk about this he called his manager my manager and they talked and he is such a very very nice person very nice but I realized it was the devil because my brakes I spent my brakes on the computer either reading or writing and somehow does seem to create a problem and we needed to talk and I have seen a lot of things happen in between so I believe God is going to do something what I don't know for who I don't know but as we travel along I believe we will see the hand of God revealed now it's very very easy to think that maybe somebody's trying to take your money to take money out of your pocket in the first place it's not our money we all agree on that but it's very very easy to think that way and you know instead of us thinking that somebody's probably trying to take money out of our pockets let us look at it from a different angle let us look at it from a different angle that God is giving us an opportunity to open the windows of heaven because when you read let's read Malachi 3:10 again Malachi 3:10 bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of Hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it praise be to God the only place God gives us the opportunity to prove him by paying our tithes now you may think but is saying here to see in whether you what are you not open the windows of heaven but then you realize that the keys are in your hands because there is a condition that must be fulfilled before God opens the windows of heaven and the first part has to do with you you have to be honest in your type pain you have to fulfill that obligation to pay your tithe and then prove God so it is you fulfilling that obligation that would compel God to open the windows of heaven and prada blessing on you so guess who is holding the key the key is in your hand so see it as an opportunity God has given you to open the windows of heaven to see the blessings of God rain on your life praise be to God now last week shortly before we left we read a few scriptures Genesis 14 17 to 20 Leviticus 27:30 30 to Hebrews 7 to I will not go through all that but I just read Genesis 14 18 I think Genesis 14 again Genesis 14 and I read from 18 okay let's from 17 and the king of sodom went out to meet him after he has retained from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the king's deal and make loser the king of solemn brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the Most High God which have delivered thine enemies into that hand and he gave him tithes of all praise be to God and I remember before we left we said we're going to look at what that means because when we read from Hebrews 7 2 it talks about 1/10 1/10 which is our tithes so 1/10 of what we make is the tide now before I get there what I want to say here when you read Matthew 22 17 to 21 when the Pharisees went to term the Lord Jesus Christ they asked him is it right to pay tribute to Caesar now tribute or the tribute money when you read from the commentary is tax money that is what it is so they were tempting Jesus to see his response is it right for us to pay to arm to pay taxes to Caesar and he said but why do you tempt me and he asked them whose portrait or whose picture whose image is on the tribute money and they said Caesar and he said give unto Caesar that things that belong to Caesar and unto God the things that belong to God so when you look at you as an individual you have two responsibilities here you have a responsibility to Caesar to the government of the country in which you live and you also have a responsibility to God the Lord Jesus was not against pain of taxes as a matter of fact once upon a time he asked Peter to go and cut the hook in the sea and the first fish he catches it should open the mouth and he will find money he should want pay tribute money for him and for hypocrite so as Christians we believe in paying taxes if you are doing business of any kind you are the state or the country which you live taxes tax evasion as a matter of fact is a serious crime they can't imprison you for that that is how serious it is by praise be to God you and I don't even have to think of tax evasion because we can't evade taxes because before the money gets to us Uncle Sam would have taken his portion so we don't have to worry about it except for those who find themselves doing some business in future then is something to think about so before the money comes to you Uncle Sam would have taken his portion and then the rest comes to you now we are talking about tides being one thing of what you make and the question that you out there the other day was is it 1/10 of our gross growth is before the taxes are taken out or is it 1/10 of our net that is after the taxes are taken out which is which praise be to God I would welcome that amen yes any contributions um just feel free this is the house of God I pay my tithe on the gross I feel like I'm not paying my tires on everything all right so he pays his ties from the gross else he doesn't feel like he's paying anything oh he's doing the right thing maybe Connie share with us their reason behind it oh but in the end I mean mathematically if I if you pay your tithes on the net well all your tie all the taxes you paid was your money and you're not paying your tithes on that money you're paying your tithes on everything else but you're not paying your tire than that money so how can you have how can you have paid your tithe on everything if you haven't paid your tithe on all you know your net and everything that came out for them okay god bless you brother yes I pay my own underneath now if you ask me know why I mean I just feel that's the right thing to do no I think when you come to telling you I can't convince anybody it's a revelation I mean it's something I can tell somebody no this is what you need to do I cannot I mean it's something no God have to reveal it at you it's a personal affair I mean you cannot because then you just get in - no - because you know issue people you know so that's something you know you have to ask God to help you with any other answer so as far as gross or net as far as how it should be paid once again like where the Johnny said it has to be about whatever it is that you're doing has to be a revelation to you that that's what God's requiring of you you know I mean in this matter of tithing you know both Steve I also pay on the gross at the top cuz I feel like all of that is my money even though the government stills part of it I feel like that's all my money even though they're stealing it and I honor God by giving him a tenth of all of my money because it's all mine even if the government took some like I don't pick what part of the money I don't pick not to pay tithing on my mortgage payment or not to pay tithing on my utilities or something like that but also there's instances where people maybe have I grew up in a family where we had a business and you would have people say why you should pay gross on the total of your earnings and what you have to do there then is you look at it is you're paying yourself out of your business now if you find yourself you know paying all your expenses out of your business you're like well I'm paying that on my business and that's business expenses so I'm not paying tithing on it well you're gonna find some gray lines in there but if you're taking an actual salary from your business then you paying the gross on your salary obviously you're not going to pay the gross on the total earnings coming into the business because some of that is going back out in costs for running the business whether it's employee salaries or you know paying for keeping equipment up and running and things like that that is not actually your earnings that's what's keeping your business running so you know those are things you can look into gross net and it's going to depend on your your situation and then at the end of they even after that it's gonna depend on the revelations god given you on where you should go with that you know pinata you peel a tire on a knife in me penis for yourself but the church you pay the tire to the church every time you wake you pay your tithe to the church it make the church to go yeah when you pay the tithe to the church and it just pray for you but when you bear it tie in the neck the chest to have anything to do it getting me you pay it when you temper ten percent of your time when you get hundred dollar I took a ten dollars you know where you get five hundred you took a home ah mmm you bring it to the church and you put it down to the other and they pass top three on your utter then Corey wore your blessing and your blessing I will pour it down for you so anything I put here in it would be blessed your best name would be blessed your work would be blessed they will promote you they would do everything for you well you jump it on in there and no blessing there no do not do it bring your tire weight put it start with it Josh I mean opinion my humble opinion I think it has to be scriptural first because the Bible says the Abraham paid out of all so of all there's not necessarily means so the Bible says that Abraham paid the town of all so when they say all it's not just a little portion of something or not because of it because it's taken out of somewhere you say of all so everything that he had you know he took actually the 1/10 at the one-tenth of a way of everything that he had so for instance has a sister say for example if you have $100 of course you take $10 out of it you know and and that's just what I had to say so he has to be scripturally spoken so it's about the whole thing it's not really just about a little portion that is taken out so thank you anyone else if you are thinking it is food as you put her name and it talked to the pastor or a church we pay our type from the cross goes I believe that's what we and so we go we go to the cross and even as we students I used to pay for my scholarship because I wouldn't because I told whatever aim that's what I have to be Tim testing for I just realized I've been stealing from God so I just sorry that I have I get a bad thing for God for all the back in the crews that I didn't feed I want to go back to be on February 1st are doing your holiness go help me praise the Lord yes bless you Saint when it comes to tithe I know just it's a bit you know certain Satan can sometimes give you reasons which are compelling and you know if you're working he will say ok you don't have to pay my taxes I have to pay my water bills I have to pay everything if I give tithes if you look back and see ask yourself what's my income because that's our income whether it's gross or net it's income but you have to pay on your growth because that's what you're getting before you pay other things you know you have car payments it's your car but if you look at it it's got to give you that car and if you value God you'll know that God gave you that hands to go and work so whatever he worked and on with those hands is an income that you have to give to God 10% it took me time to understand there too you know I remember one time brother Cassidy stood here and he talked about tithing and grows I had to go back and look because for me I was dying for a long time I was typing net income until I understood what's income which is gross income your income what you get you check you look at the gross forget about what the tax is the city takes the government takes I don't know if it's robbing or taking away yeah it's your gross yeah it's your gross income cuz there are some states they don't take income right you Hampshire so what are you going to type them are you gonna look for other things to subtract so that you you die - no it's your gross income so if you look at it even if in their altars cement you'll see bring the first fruits if you see once they planted corn or anything they gave 10% they didn't look and say okay they've gotta take out what I invested he know so yeah it takes time we learn in part it takes time to learn and it's a learning process so god bless you god bless you brother yes so now we the last one I think I'm already out of time when I come to tidings I think that you know better than some time in last week he was talking about tithing a little bit and you know some of us got to understand that time when you can when it comes to pay in time it's not just when your net it's most often from your growth you know I want to be thankful to God that I almost do this back at the time I was in Liberia it was not really preach like the web brother they're been teaching on but God gave me a revelation as a person I started paying my time all my growth but I want to ask better than a question I know when it comes to Taipei now in our study in the u.s. we basically you know base our tithing on income which is most of the on money we earn but when you look at the days of all and you bring it back to our modern days like those that doing agricultural like farm work if it comes to paying ten percent of your income we know our money like my sister or what they were just saying when it comes with level you get $100 you would pay like 10% out of the hundred when you get five hundred you're gonna pay that fifty and you just make a calculation from there but when it comes to our brothers and sisters who occupation is agriculture how do they go about calculating that 10 percent of the attack on what they have planted publishable yes so thank you all for the contributions very important contributions very important contributions here and a Cissna cease question first the state paid to the pasta or to the church tight is god's own money and when you look at the Old Testament coming I mean it was just 1/10 to the Levitical priesthood so it doesn't make any difference if you are giving your tight to the pasta oh you come to church you put it in the upper tree of course we normally write what is offering or tight you note it on the envelope so that no way it is going did you see do you have to write a personal name or something you know back home we use not to write our names on the envelope we just put it in so even when we came here we had problems because I mean you write your name on the envelope are not only that but at the end of the year where the amount you paid you are giving how do they call it a statement to file for taxes you know but so there is a promissory I wouldn't say it's a problem initially some of us had problems with this okay so in some setting I will say no here in the US I will say yes and no [Applause] praise the Lord you know because yes because that money you pay as tight it's God's money you get that one out okay in other ways that money was not yours so the state and federal government would calculate their refund okay very funny I want to give you based on how much actually came to you so this is where it becomes a little interesting so when you take order contributions you made out and make up a yo-yo your tights out then they will look at not how much you made because they are going to subtract your tithing if you made other contribution somewhere they will subtract all that and then they come to your federal they come to our forgotten oh come on they come to how much you really am a truly come to your pocket and based on that it is not okay that taxes we took from you was right oh no it was too much let's give you something back oh no it was less you have to give us something in addition that was aroused very good so that's why weight becomes a little trickier but if you don't put your name on it nobody loves you if you put your name on it it's not wrong but it doesn't make any difference what are you hanging your tight over to the past or you put it in the basket it eventually comes back to him it's God's money and he is in the position to take that money praise be to God yoke oh my goodness time is up you know but let me just say this for the farmers you bring 10% of your harvest if I go into corn production and I get hundred bucks that season I bring ten bucks now you are permitted when you go to the Old Testament you are permitted if Karen you're tied to we're supposed to go is far you can come that into mining and then carry the money but it's ten bucks if you make hundred bags of corn now oh you know what you guys just give me three minutes praise be to God now I want to be controversial here let's assume those of you said is gross those of you said is net everybody is correct comma but there is a caveat anyway you say this please put comedy and remember I said there is a caveat you know what I wouldn't even touch this I will just leave it because we are past time but I have loved every bit of this it's wonderful and by the grace of God you know where I'm coming from praise be to God it's a very good place to stop shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus Wayne thank you so much old God for the opportunity we've had father to talk about your goodness and to discuss issues father in your house issues pertaining to your kingdom we are so grateful Lord that we can have an opportunity like this in an atmosphere like this father to discuss some of these things and we are trusting in your divine leadership in your divine
