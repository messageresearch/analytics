[Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] but is full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures both christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh now it says that john was in the spirit on the lord's day oh my here is a verse that really causes some dissension not that it needs to or ought to but some just don't see what the word really says first of all we find some fine folks that call the lord's day the sabbath day which to them is saturday then there are the others who call the lord's day sunday the first day of the week but how could it be either of these days or even the two put together for john was in the spirit receiving those visions for a period of two years actually what had happened was that john was caught up in the spirit and transported into the lord's day which is yet to come the bible speaks of the day of the lord which is to be in the future and john is now seeing the things of that future day but in the meantime just to settle our minds let us find out exactly what the sabbath is today the sabbath as we know it from the new testament is not the keeping of a certain day we have no command whatsoever to keep saturday for a sabbath nor do we have any commandment to keep the first day of the week which is sunday here is the truth of the sabbath which means rest hebrews 4 8 for if jesus had given them rest or rest day then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore arrest sabbath keeping to the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he also have ceased from his own works as god did from his did you hear that key phrase in the last part of the verse god ceased from his own works god gave israel the seventh day for their sabbath in commemoration of his own work wherein he created the world and all that was therein and then stopped creating he ceased from his labors he rested now it was fine to give a sabbath rest to a people who were all in one place at one time so they could all keep a certain day today half the world is in light while the other half is in darkness so it wouldn't work at all but that is just an argument from the natural let's see what the bible teaches us about this sabbath rest for he that is entered into his rest this entering in is not only entering in but remaining in the rest it is an eternal rest of which the seventh day is but a type seven is completion eight is the first day again jesus resurrection was in the first day of the week giving us eternal life and eternal sabbath rest thus we see why god could not give us any one certain day of the week as a sabbath rest we've entered into and do remain in our rest which israel could not do having only a shadow of the true substance which we enjoy why go back to his shadow when we have reality now how we receive this rest or continuing sabbath is at the invitation of jesus he said in matthew 11 28-29 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me and ye shall find rest or keeping of the sabbath not a day but eternal life sabbath unto your souls no matter how long you have been laboring under your load of sin whether it is 10 years 30 years or 50 years or longer come with your tired weary life and you will find his rest the true sabbath jesus will give you rest now exactly what is that rest that jesus will give isaiah 28 8-12 for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest sabbath wherewith he may cause the weary to rest or keeping of his sabbath and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear here it is prophesied right here in isaiah and it came to pass about 700 years later at pentecost when they were all filled with the holy ghost exactly as it was said they would be this is the true sabbath that was promised thus when they were filled with the holy ghost they ceased from their worldly works their worldly doings their evil ways the holy ghost took charge of their lives they entered into rest there is your rest that is your sabbath it is not a day nor a year but the eternity of being filled and blessed in the holy spirit it is you ceasing and god doing it is god in you willing and doing of his good pleasure let me make one more note about the saturdayarians who claim that we meet on the wrong day of the week when we meet on sunday the first day here is what justin said in the second century on sunday a meeting is held of all who live in cities and villages and a section is read of the memoirs of the apostles and the writings as long as time permits when the reading is finished the president in a discourse gives the admonition and exhortation to imitate those noble things after this we all arise to offer common prayer at the close of the prayer as we have described bread and wine are placed before us and thanksgiving made and the congregation answers amen then the elements are distributed to each one and are partaken of and carried by the deacons to the house of the absent the wealthy and willing then give contributions according to their free will and this collection is deposited with the president who there with supplies orphans widows prisoners strangers in want thus we see that those who claim the early church carried on the judaic tradition of assembling on the last day of the week are grossly ignorant of what history actually sets forth and are therefore not worthy of confidence oh that people might come unto him and find that rest there is a cry in all hearts for that rest but the majority don't know the answer so they try to steal the cry by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational creeds and dogmas but failing in that many try drinking carousing and every physical excess thinking that by worldly pleasures there can be some satisfaction but in such there is no rest they smoke and take pills to quiet their nerves but there is no rest in earthly potions they need jesus they need the heavenly remedy the rest of the spirit then the most of them go to church on sunday that is good but even there they have no idea of how to approach god and how to worship him jesus said that true worship was in spirit and in truth john 4 24. but what kind of worship can you get in a church that knows so little of god it puts up a santa claus at christmas and bunnies at easter where did they get that they got it from the pagans and made it a part of the church doctrine but when one turns to the lord and is filled with the holy ghost he ceases from all such things he has a rest in his soul he really begins to live and love god and worship him now let's get back to our scripture we know what the lord's day is not if it is not saturday or sunday what is it well let's put it this way today is certainly not the lord's day this is man's day it is man's doing man's work man's church man's idea of worship man's everything for it is man's world cosmos but the day of the lord is coming yes it is it is just that at this time of the revelation of jesus christ john was taken up by the spirit and transported by the spirit to that great day that is coming the lord's day is when the days of man are over the kingdoms of this world will then become the kingdoms of our god the day of the lord is when the judgments fall and after that comes the millennium right now the world does what it wants to do with the christian they call him all manner of evil names making fun of him but there is coming that great and notable day when they will wail and howl for the lamb is coming in wrath to judge the world that is when the righteous will have their day with the lord for the wicked shall burn and the righteous will walk over their ashes into the millennium malachi 4 3. and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes unto the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts the voice like a trumpet revelation 1 and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet john was in the spirit and when he was he saw the great and wonderful day of the lord jesus and all his holy power the future was about to unfold for god was about to teach him john did not say it was a trumpet it was like a trumpet now when a trumpet is blown it has an urgency about it it is like the herald the king's messenger coming to the people he blows on a trumpet it is an urgent call the people gather to listen israel was always assembled by the sounding of a trumpet something important is at hand listen to it so this voice had the same urgency of appeal as did the trumpet clear and strong it was startling and awakening oh that we might hear the voice of god as a trumpet this day for it is the gospel trumpet sounding forth the word of prophecy to make us aware of and prepared for what is coming upon the earth the command to write revelation 1 11 saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia onto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and on to philadelphia and unto laodicea here it is the first and last the alpha and omega that's all of it the one true god the voice and word of god reality and truth is at hand what a thing it is to be in the spirit my to be in the presence of god and hear from him what thou seest write in a book and send it to the seven churches the voice that sounded forth his word in the garden of eden and upon mount sinai which voice was also heard in the excellent glory of the mount of transfiguration was once again sounding forth and this time to the seven churches with the complete and final revelation of jesus christ write the visions john make a record of them for the ages which are to follow for they are the true prophecies which must come to pass write them and send them out making them known john recognized that voice oh you will recognize that voice when he calls if you are one of his own the golden lamp stands revelation 1 12 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks john does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see the voice oh i like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same jesus is the word john 1 1-3 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made if you can ever get to really see the word you will be seeing jesus when john turned he saw seven golden candlesticks actually there were lamp stands and according to verse 20 they are the seven churches the seven candlesticks that thou sawest are the seven churches to represent the churches they could hardly be candles a candle burns but a while and then is burned out it dies there would be no more to it but lamp stands possess a lasting quality not found in candles if you want to get a beautiful picture of the lamp read about it in zechariah 4 1-6 and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see is thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me know us down not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts here is another lamp of pure gold it is burning brightly because it has plenty of oil which it is getting from the two olive trees which stand on either side the two trees represent the old and new testament and of course the oil typifies the holy ghost who alone can give the light of god to the people the angel who spoke to zechariah was as much as saying this what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the holy ghost now examine this lamp stand you will notice that it has a large bowl or reservoir that is central to seven arms that come out of it this bowl is filled with olive oil which flows through seven wicks which are placed in the seven arms it is the same oil that burns and makes a light at the end of the seven pipes this light never went out the priests just kept pouring oil into the bowl the lamp was lit in a special way first the priest took fire from the sacred altar which was originally lighted by the fire of god he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl he then lit the second lamp from the flame of the first lamp the third lamp received its fire from the second lamp as did the fourth receive its from the third and so on until all the seven lamps were burning this holy fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp is a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven church ages the original outpouring of pentecost which outpouring came direct from jesus on the mercy seat is enduing his church through all the seven ages and showing forth perfectly that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever the never changing god in his essence and his ways in john 15 jesus said i am the vine ye are the branches he is the main vine that which comes out of the original root from the original seed that has the life in it now the vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that do that now watch this you can take a citrus tree such as an orange tree and graft into it a grapefruit limb a lemon limb a tangelo limb and other kinds of that variety and all those limbs will grow but those grafted limbs will not bear oranges no sir the lemon limb will bear lemons and the grapefruit limb will bear grapefruit and so on yet those limbs will be thriving off the life in the tree but if that tree ever puts forth another branch of itself it will be an orange branch and bare oranges why because the life in the limb and the life in the trunk are identical whereas it wasn't so with the grafted limbs those grafted branches had their sources in other kinds of life from other trees from other roots from other seeds oh they will bear fruit all right but they won't bear oranges they cannot because they are not the original that's the way the church is the vine has been split and limbs have been grafted in they have grafted in baptist limbs methodist limbs presbyterian limbs and pentecostal limbs and those limbs are bearing baptist methodist pentecostal and presbyterian fruit denominational seeds from which they produce their fruit but if the vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that branch will be exactly like the vine itself it will be the same kind of a branch that was brought forth at pentecost it will speak in tongues prophesy and have the power and signs of the resurrected jesus christ in it why because it's thriving on the natural resources of the vine itself you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the vine when those other branches were grafted in all they could do was bear their own fruit for they were not born of that vine they don't know about that original life and original fruit they cannot know for they were not born of it but if they had been born of it that same life that was in the original stem jesus would have come through them and manifested through them john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father denominations which are man directed cannot be born of god for it is the spirit not man that gives life how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that main bowl because they had their wicks dipped therein each church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the holy ghost his wick life has been immersed in christ through that wick he is drawing the very life of christ and by it gives out light to the church what kind of a light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit and right on down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that is hid with christ in god not only can we speak thus of the messengers but every true believer is dramatically depicted here they are all drawing from the same source they have all been dipped into the same bowl they are dead to themselves and their lives are hid with christ in god they are sealed in by the holy ghost ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with the visible life is burning and shining giving light and manifestations of the holy ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in god and fed by the lord's word satan cannot touch them not even death can touch them for death has lost its sting the grave has lost its victory thanks be unto god they have this victory in and through the lord jesus christ amen and amen no longer the priest revelation 1 13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gert about the paps with a golden girdle there he stands one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches it is the lord's day for john sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge the golden girdle is no longer girt around the waist where the priest must wear it as he ministers to god in the holiest place but it is now around his shoulders for he is not now the priest but the judge now has john 5 22 come to pass for the father judgeth no man but have committed all judgment unto the son his service has been rendered the priesthood is over the days of the prophecy are finished he stands girded as the judge the seven-fold glory of his person revelation 1 14-16 his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength how deeply moving and inspiring was the appearing of jesus to john who was in exile for the cause of the word and behold the living word now stands before him what an illuminating vision for every descriptive attribute has a significance what a revelation of his glorious being one his hair as white as snow john first notices and mentions the whiteness of his hair it was white and as bright as snow this was not because of his age oh no the brilliantly white hair does not signify age but experience maturity and wisdom the eternal one does not age what is time to god time means little to god but wisdom means much it is as when solomon called to god for wisdom to judge the people of israel now he is coming the judge of all the earth he will be crowned with wisdom that is what the white and glistening hair signifies see this in daniel 7 9-14 i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is in everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed there it is daniel saw him with that white hair he was the judge opening the books and judging out of them daniel saw him coming in clouds that is exactly what john saw they both saw him exactly the same they saw the judge with his judgment girdle over his shoulders standing pure and holy full of wisdom fully qualified to judge the world in righteousness hallelujah even the world understands this symbology for in ancient times the judge would appear and convene court dressed in a white wig and a long robe that signified his complete authority head-to-foot robe to meet out justice two his eyes as fire think of it those eyes that were once dimmed with tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that wept with compassion at the grave of lazarus those eyes that saw not the evil of the murderers who hanged him on a cross but in sorrow cried father forgive them now those eyes are a flame of fire the eyes of the judge who will recompense those who rejected him of all the human emotions he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often yet behind that weeping and that sorrow there was still god those same eyes saw visions they looked deep within the hearts of men and read their very thoughts and knew all their various ways blazing out of mortal eyes was god who cried to those who knew him not for what he was if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins john 8 24 if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do the works of my father though ye believe not me believe the works john 10 37-38 like jeremiah of old he was the weeping prophet for men received not the word of god and thrust aside the revelation those fiery flaming eyes of the judge are even now recording the lives of all flesh running to and fro throughout the earth there is nothing he does not know he knows the desires of the heart and what each one intends to do there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you are thinking yes there he stands as judge with flaming eyes to meet out judgment the day of mercy is over oh that men might repent and seek his face in righteousness while there is yet time that they might make his bosom their pillow air the world dissolves in fire three the feet of brass and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace brass is noted for its remarkable hardness there is nothing that is known that you can put with it to temper it but this brass that describes his feet is more remarkable yet in that it has stood the test of the fiery furnace a test that no other one has gone through and that is exactly right for brass signifies divine judgment a judgment that god decreed and brought to pass john 3 14-19 and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil numbers 21 8-9 and the lord said unto moses make me a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived israel had sinned sin had to be judged so god commanded moses to place a brazen serpent on a pole and he who looked was saved from the penalty of his sin the brazen serpent on the pole symbolized sin from the garden of eden where the serpent beguiled eve causing her to sin brass speaks of judgment as is seen in the brazen altar where the penalty for sin was met in the sacrifice upon the altar when god judged israel for her sins in the days of elijah he withheld the rain and the fiery heavens became as brass now in this illustration we see that the serpent upon the pole represents sin already judged for it is made of brass showing divine judgment had already fallen upon sin then whoever looked at the serpent on the pole accepting the significance of it was made whole for this was the work or salvation of the lord the serpent on the pole is a type of what jesus came into the earth to accomplish he was made flesh in order to take upon himself the judgments of god for sin the foundation of the altar of sacrifice was solid brass typifying the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world judgment had already passed upon him when as yet there were no sinners salvation being entirely of the lord he trod the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of god alone his vestures were dyed crimson with his own blood the fiery furnace of the just judgment and wrath of god was his portion he suffered the just for the unjust thou art worthy o lamb of god for thou hast redeemed us by thine own blood he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed the lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all he suffered as no man had ever suffered even before the cross he had shed great drops of sweat like blood from his body as in the intense agony of the ordeal ahead the very blood separated in his veins luke 22 44 and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground but someday those feet of brass will stand upon the earth and the judge of all the earth he shall be and with equity [Music] [Music] you
