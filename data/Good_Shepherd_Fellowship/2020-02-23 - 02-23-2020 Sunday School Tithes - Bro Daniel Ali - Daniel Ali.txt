========================================

[Music] you [Music] praise the Lord thank you all for coming once again shall we go to the Lord in prayer our Lord in Our Saviour Jesus we are so grateful once again our God that we can come before the throne of grace with great expectation knowing that you keep your promise for you have made us a promise that would be with us even to the end of the world you will be with us and you will never forsake us no leave us now wherever we gather you would come down dear Lord Jesus and honor yourself in our midst and further once again we have gathered together and we know without any shadow of doubt that you keep your word we pray the Father for all that I have done for us we worship the Lord Jesus we bless thee and will glorify the old God that we can go to bed and rise up onto our feet in a very strong physical and mental condition and come to your house dear Lord Jesus to give you praise and honor we thank you for everything you've done for us and we are trusting you father this morning that you speak to us during the course of this Sunday School and further as you are getting to the end of this topic we prayed about a time we bring this topic the Catchings down on this topic you will have open our eyes to see things we may never have seen before all things we knew but overlooked and do it as our faith leaders granted on to us father we pray this morning in Jesus name Amen so so we are still looking at our our topic on Titan and we are going to look at the reason why the actual reason why I decided to I deserve for us to look at this topic together there is a lot of blessings in pay entites people have been very very faithful in a way in the Atty pain but they have never seen God move it is not because they are not faithful in their tight pain it's not because they are not dream why do you support what you are supposed to do but is a little step a lot of us including myself overlooked and that hinder the entire blessing and that is why I believe God ladies on my heart for us to look at it together it's not to say that everything we've looked at before wasn't important everything we have talked about as a matter of fact was very important and very dear to this topic but I believe with all my heart that this is what holds the secret today and hold fast to it before I zero in on it brotherbrother said in the message that prophet speaking God been misunderstood 1961 he said I would like to give you I'm wearing a different glasses today the other one broke last week this is disturbing my eyes I would like to give you a little testimony of how that I was even hungry and my mother and them hungry and my dad is sick but I took my tights out first and give it a good and you ought to see what happened I have never seen in life that any man woman that if that you make $1 a week bring the 10 cents of that money and put it into your storehouse and a church where you come if God don't bless that call me a hypocrite that is a very hard statement for the prophet of God to make the statement yes a that's a challenge to anybody every Christian should pay tithe now as I started in my intro I said you can pay tithe all your life and still miss out on the blessing the Bible says in Luke 12 31 and then Matthew 6:33 let's just take that let's take Matthew 6:33 alright 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you seek ye first the kingdom of God I always try to seek the interests of God above your personal interests the Bible says that we should give God the preeminence in our life always put God first when you put God first God puts you first and when you put God second you may think God put you second no he puts you las give God the preeminence now as I said I just love this portion I think I just love this portion of the whole subject more than any other part first Kings 17 first Kings 17 I read from ten I have it all the way to 24 but I'll just end at 1417 first Kings 10 so he rose and went to Zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold a widowed woman was there dead rain of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pretty a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pretty a muzzle of bread in thine hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a kick but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am gathering two sticks that I will go in and rest it for me and my son that we may eat who may eat it and I praise be to God this was Elijah when he said that wouldn't be rain or Dew till he called for it for three and a half years there was drought on the land there was no ring we all know the story how he was had a brook and a brook dried up I don't have much time I don't want to go into it but then God directed him to go to the riff-off and that he had commanded a widow woman to take care of him and then Elijah goes to Zarephath and then he sees this woman gathering sticks to go and prepare food for her and her son that they may eat and I and Aleya to the woman that got me some water to drink remember this was a time of drought where I was very scarce it just sends me down memory lane a lot of stories no time praise Beauty God and then as she was going to get him the water to drink then he says no just water alone but when you are coming just get me a muzzle of bread something to eat and that was very very hard not only was he asking for water to drink but also food and the food she had was the last bit of it and to tell you how small it was the Bible says she was gathering just two sticks to go and prepare cake for her and for her son that they may eat and I that tells you how small the food was then a prophet of God says you know what not just a portion of it not after you and your son have eaten but you know what bring me the first portion the first patch do it praise be to God it was very hard it was very very hard to but he she went and she did exactly what the prophet of God told him told her to do and the Bible says when you read down that that cruse of oil never run out and a jar of flour never run out for everyday they'll eat till berths and down rain until there was food she never liked food what brought the blessing this is where the secret of type pain lies the whole secret of paying tithes is that you take God's portion fests take God's portion take that money that belongs to God take it out first don't wait till you have taken out your car note see you have paid your rent tell you I've taking money for food tell you I've done all that before you pay your tithe if that is the way you pay your tithes you can pay your tithe all your life and you wouldn't see the hand of God you are paying your ties all right you've been very faithful you pay is that what you're supposed to pay yet you are not seen the blessings it's because you are not taking that money out first think of what would have happened if the widow had not given Elijah the first portion and had probably eaten with her son and only brought Elijah the left over I bet you she would have died of hunger there was a specific instruction bring me the first batch don't make your ties the last item on your budget you're tight must be the first thing that comes out of your salary the first thing that comes out of your anus out of your income check it out first put it aside even if is not a day that maybe Wednesday or Sunday where you can come to church just take it aside put it aside do not forget if you want to see God move because God has given us his word now we should prove him and see if you not open the doors the windows of heaven and pour as a blessing that will not be able to contain it's a promise God has made and God keeps his word if you are not seeing it examine yourself see what you are doing wrong God is not a liar as he said anything and has not done it praise be to God take God's portion out first let it be the first thing that comes out fresh be to God do it and see what is going to happen the second portion I want to talk of how tight pain becomes a blessing actually I forgot to talk so that does the tight amine arm that the topic the topic for the sub topic for today how tight pain becomes a blessing so that is my point number one point number two I think this is the point number one the Bible says in Malachi 3:11 that when you pay your tithe God rebukes the hand of the Devorah so there is a Devorah now sometimes you take your salary you don't even know what you do with it you don't know where the money went it's like the money ever printed through your palm it happens God has made us a promise that he will be he will reboot the hand of the Devorah and now just think about it that if you do not pay your tight out frist and then you wait till you make all your expenses and then you bring your tight in as the last item you've already wasted the money God is supposed to reboot the hand of the Devorah on that income but he fall ready wasted it and you are bringing your tie to God as the last item so what is there now to rebuke but when you take the first portion out that 10% out there is a 90% daddy's day God is going to big the hand rebuke the handle a Devorah on that 90% but after you have waster than any percent and a tight is your last item and you bring it that's what you have done praise be to God so all these come under my first point that make sure that a tight is the first item that is living your your earnings give it to God now how tight pain also become a blessing honesty is very very important be honest in your type give God exactly what God deserves don't give him what you think he deserves if he's hundred dollars you take $10 at least a thousand you take hundred elicits if it is ten thousand you take thousand dollars part you know there is something about type pain that sometimes we are very honest when they our mouth is small hundred dollars or ten dollars is nothing thousand dollars one hundred dollars and then ten thousand you're just counting hundred five hundred six thousand and you look Harriton is too much why don't you look at the nine thousand that is left and you are ready looking at the tozi I'm going to give to God praise be to God the Bible says godliness with contentment is a great game be content with what you have then 90 percent be content with it as a matter of fact then 90 percent is nine times more than what you are giving God but it never makes you to see that small portion are given to God as something so big and you forget that you have the largest portion and you are looking at what is going to God and then you get fifty thousand and then I think you know what five thousand tight that is big morning and then you begin to decide how much you think you should give God if you give God instead of 5,000 out of 50,000 and your thing is too much so they are going to give God four thousand nine hundred that is very close you've done well guess what is better I didn't even give that money it's better 10% means 10% if you give anything less it was very didn't be honest in your typing another side of being honest in your type pain is this let's see if you are making say thousand dollars every two weeks and paying hundred dollars is not a problem and then you begin to make say ten thousand every two weeks and out of the ten thousand you're supposed to pay thousand dollars every two weeks and then that becomes a problem that becomes a problem in essence do you know what you are telling God what you are telling God is that I am not comfortable and in this much praise the Lord this is where I am comfortable so instead of keeping me here just bring me down here so I can end thousand dollars praying hundred dollars it's not a problem it's when I'm painting it's when I'm paying the thousand dollars that is a problem guess what so a lot of the times we miss out on the blesses of God because of our own selfishness in a sense that's what we're telling God I don't have a problem a hundred dollars every two weeks has died but when God promotes me and I begin to make a lot of money paying nine thousand dollars to God as tight has become a problem so what I'm telling God is that you know what demote me bring me down let's say action speaks louder than ways you don't open your mouth to verbalize it right by your action by your behavior that is what you're telling God praise be to God this topic so this I would say is the main point if you ever missed out on anything during the course of this teaching just make sure you don't miss out on this it's very very important for me this is where the blessing is this is where the blessing is never forget I would have to kiss you not this topic I don't think I would do that I think I may I may just end up somewhere next week whatever I don't care I'll just leave it if there is another time I would come back and finish it off praise be to God now the next thing before I'm just five minutes away you can write it down and read it later we don't have much time Philippians 4:6 says that be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication make your requests known unto God and then I just want to first write to Matthew 7:7 will says ask and shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and the door shall be opened unto you praise be to God now God already knows our needs before we then come to him the Bible says you supply all our needs according to his riches in glory he knows what we need before we even come but he expects us to ask he wants you to come and talk about it he wants you to come and ask for data ask receive he was you to seek for data seek find he wants you to knock for David knock the door would be open today he expects you so you know what God has made us a promise that when we pay our tithes we should prove him and see if you not open the windows of heaven and pour us a blessing that will not be able to contain but you know what don't just take your tights and then just put it in an envelope will come and dump it in the basket when you take your time even though God has media promise take that tight to God ref ed got his own word reflect God to his bone world this is what your word and joins me to do that as you bring a tenth of my anus or my income on my salary to you as tight and I have it here your word says we should prove you and see further I bring these are my requests nevertheless let your will be done look if you have to soak that tight if you have to suck it in tears so get wet and come and put it in the offering praise be to God if you have to suck it wet in prayer suck it in prayer and come and put it in don't just take you to come and put it and that is good but not good enough pray over it I forgot his word remind god of his promises talk to God about it praise be to God let God know that you are in expectation let him know that you are counting on his word of promise let him know that you are proving him is that prove me and see praise be to God how does Taipei become a blessing that is the topic of today I'm just a minute away I just had a little tinny here about maybe a judge on his seat and what have you when he when you come before that is they said I just paraphrase in now no time the judge doesn't care how intelligent you are you can come and speak book knowledge the judge doesn't fear that when the judge takes his seat what he fears is a lawyer who knows his constitution a lawyer who knows the statutes who has read statutes he has read a law that he doesn't give the judge room to do what he wants to do he will refer him the law says this and the judge has nothing to do god loves it if you can refer him to his word praise be to God come by the way of the word FL go to his word and let God know that you are counting on his word of promise stay right there if you don't see the hand of God then there is something wrong somewhere praise be to God we are right on time next week I don't know how next week is going to look like I have a lot of change to prepare for next week but I'm trusting the grace of God that I may be able to say to do something about this yes oh yes help me in your prayers I need it shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus we thank you so much oh god for this morning we are so grateful Father for helping us to look at this together for me this was the whole secret about I pray that if we could see this and do it
