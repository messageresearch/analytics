[1:11:05] little bible studies with you there is
[1:11:09] there is there is uh something that have
[1:11:11] created a very serious question in my
[1:11:13] mind for many years for many years and
[1:11:18] because of
[1:11:20] that uh I really never took a comfort to
[1:11:25] speak on tithes and
[1:11:28] offering praise the
[1:11:30] Lord because many times you talk about
[1:11:33] tis and offering the people think you
[1:11:36] are on a money
[1:11:37] hunt they think you're about now to
[1:11:39] start looking into their pocket and want
[1:11:42] to know what bank account they have
[1:11:44] you're on the on the money hunt but TI
[1:11:47] and offering is a Biblical principle
[1:11:49] amen and it's for our own our own
[1:11:52] blessing praise the Lord and uh uh but
[1:11:57] for some
[1:11:58] reason I I couldn't find the Comfort to
[1:12:02] speak on TI and offering until the Lord
[1:12:05] helped me just few years ago to be able
[1:12:10] to put an understanding to what I will
[1:12:13] share with you and uh uh I
[1:12:18] remember a brother called
[1:12:21] me a brother called me and uh
[1:12:27] uh let's read let's read U Deuteronomy
[1:12:31] chapter 26 if you want to turn to your
[1:12:34] Bible we'll do a little bible study here
[1:12:37] and then we will go in speaking into the
[1:12:39] word this
[1:12:41] morning praise the Lord Deuteronomy
[1:12:44] chapter
[1:12:53] 26 Deuteronomy chapter
[1:13:09] 26 praise the
[1:13:15] Lord 26 let's read from verse
[1:13:23] 11 if we reir from uh
[1:13:30] uh verse 10 and now behold I have I have
[1:13:34] brought the first fruit of the land
[1:13:37] which thou oh Lord has given
[1:13:40] me and thou shall see it before the Lord
[1:13:44] thou shal set it before the Lord sorry
[1:13:47] thy God and worship before the Lord thy
[1:13:51] God now the first fruit was always uh
[1:13:54] the the your TI and offering okay first
[1:13:57] fruit was always the TI and offering now
[1:13:59] so I I just want to build so you can see
[1:14:01] where I'm going here verse 11 and thou
[1:14:05] shall rejoice in every good thing which
[1:14:08] the Lord thy God have given unto day and
[1:14:12] unto thy hand thou and the Levites and
[1:14:16] the strangers that is among you now pay
[1:14:21] attention now verse 12 when thou H has
[1:14:24] made an end of tithing all the tithes of
[1:14:30] thine increase the te year which is the
[1:14:35] year of
[1:14:36] tithing and has given it unto the Lite
[1:14:41] pay attention and has given it unto the
[1:14:45] levite the
[1:14:47] stranger the fatherless the
[1:14:51] Widow that they may eat within in thy
[1:14:56] Gates and be
[1:14:59] filled then thou shall say before the
[1:15:02] Lord thy God I have
[1:15:05] brought H H I have brought away the
[1:15:08] Hallow things out of my house and also
[1:15:11] have given them unto the Levites and
[1:15:14] unto the strangers and to the fatherless
[1:15:16] and to the Widow I call him to all the
[1:15:19] Commandments which thou has commanded me
[1:15:23] I have not
[1:15:25] transgress that commandment neither have
[1:15:28] I forgotten them praise the
[1:15:32] Lord now so when you look at this
[1:15:35] scripture
[1:15:38] closely it speaks of uh when when you
[1:15:42] are tiing now because of this scripture
[1:15:46] many people uh uh will you know they
[1:15:50] will give they will give their ties if
[1:15:53] they don't belong to a church either to
[1:15:55] a charity or they will give their Church
[1:15:58] their tie to uh off finish home or to uh
[1:16:02] you know uh um uh a final weow and they
[1:16:06] will give their title I heard someone
[1:16:09] you know uh uh told me there many years
[1:16:12] ago and they were pointing me back to
[1:16:14] the scripture says well you know I give
[1:16:17] my tie because you know the Bible says
[1:16:18] that you gave gave my tith to the widows
[1:16:20] and all that and then I will read
[1:16:23] something also to you from from uh uh
[1:16:27] uh question and
[1:16:34] answer on one of the question and
[1:16:36] answers on uh on on uh uh someone was
[1:16:39] asking question on tithe concerning this
[1:16:43] particular scripture that we have read
[1:16:45] listen to this tithe is to go to the
[1:16:48] minister that's right in the Bible they
[1:16:53] had a box that they set at the door of
[1:16:56] the
[1:16:58] Tabernacle when the building this box
[1:17:00] was was uh a form where the people put
[1:17:05] in there for the repair you have read it
[1:17:08] many times in the Old Testament you go
[1:17:10] in the book of Ezra and all of that you
[1:17:12] will read that they kept up the building
[1:17:14] and the things all the repaired of the
[1:17:17] building was taken care of from that
[1:17:20] found but the 10th when the 10th the the
[1:17:23] the Tiding all the tithing went to their
[1:17:26] priest their Pastor yes tithing are to
[1:17:30] go for nothing else I know people take
[1:17:34] their ties and give them to widow woman
[1:17:37] that's wrong if if you have got anything
[1:17:41] to give the widow woman give her but
[1:17:45] don't give her God's money that's not
[1:17:49] your place that is not yours in the
[1:17:53] first place praise the Lord now so I
[1:17:57] couldn't reconcile this with what uh uh
[1:18:02] uh Moses said in
[1:18:04] Deuteronomy for many
[1:18:06] years
[1:18:08] uh I just couldn't reconcile it so a
[1:18:11] brother called me one time and then he
[1:18:14] asked me this definite question he asked
[1:18:16] me brother one can you help me brother
[1:18:19] you know I I was thinking about this
[1:18:20] what what you think about it so uh we
[1:18:23] talk we talk about it but knowing that I
[1:18:26] have always had that in the back part of
[1:18:28] my mind I've always had a question on
[1:18:32] that in the back part of my mind and you
[1:18:34] know and and so when he asks me that it
[1:18:38] now it it just it just exposes me it
[1:18:41] exposed me to the place where I needed
[1:18:43] to find an answer so I I just uh I just
[1:18:49] I just told him I I said I said brother
[1:18:51] I mean actually the the question you are
[1:18:52] asking me I have thought about that I
[1:18:55] really not been able to reconcile this
[1:18:57] for a long time so you see whenever
[1:19:01] whenever there comes a scriptural
[1:19:03] question especially when it gets your
[1:19:06] attention it's always an opportunity if
[1:19:09] you really keep it on your mind and you
[1:19:11] really prayed about it not try to
[1:19:13] fabricate uh you know fabricate an
[1:19:15] answer uh uh no you you just prayed
[1:19:18] about it it is always an opportunity for
[1:19:22] the Holy Spirit to St to show you more
[1:19:24] than you have ever saw praise the Lord
[1:19:28] so uh uh uh I I left it for the long
[1:19:33] time and one time I was I think I was
[1:19:39] studying uh I was studying or I was
[1:19:41] listening to uh something a message or
[1:19:44] something but I was I was studying and
[1:19:47] then uh
[1:19:52] uh the subject came right back to this
[1:19:56] okay it came to the
[1:19:59] responsibility of the
[1:20:02] priesthood the responsibility of the
[1:20:05] priesthood now you have to realize that
[1:20:08] God told the children of Israel that the
[1:20:12] Levites were his amen the Levites never
[1:20:17] had no physical
[1:20:19] inheritance no there was no physical
[1:20:22] inheritance that was given to the Lev
[1:20:25] now what happened was that if you re
[1:20:28] remember in Egypt God took the first
[1:20:32] born of the children of Israel he said
[1:20:35] every first born that opened the matric
[1:20:38] of the mother the male was going to be
[1:20:41] his why because he saved the the the
[1:20:45] first born of the
[1:20:46] Hebrews praise the Lord amen save the
[1:20:50] first born of the Hebrews and the first
[1:20:53] born of the egyp ipt were
[1:20:56] slain praise the Lord
[1:21:00] hallelujah now so uh uh
[1:21:05] uh
[1:21:08] uh so God talk the firstborn the
[1:21:11] firstborn he says all the firstborn he
[1:21:13] said you have to remember that all the
[1:21:15] firstborn are mine praise the Lord so
[1:21:19] right from there you realize that uh uh
[1:21:24] uh
[1:21:27] then
[1:21:29] also God will now uh uh change the the
[1:21:34] the the
[1:21:35] firstborn and it will now becomes the
[1:21:40] Levites now the Levites when when Jacob
[1:21:43] blessed his children he he uh he gave uh
[1:21:47] levite his son was giv the
[1:21:51] priesthood they were the one that were
[1:21:53] going to self in the priesthood so
[1:21:58] now the
[1:22:01] Levites when the when uh when the child
[1:22:03] was born when when he was the first born
[1:22:06] you know uh there was something in the
[1:22:08] Bible called the Redemption money I'm
[1:22:10] trying to put my my picture together
[1:22:12] here because there's a place I want to
[1:22:14] bring you there is something called the
[1:22:16] Redemption money so the first born
[1:22:19] Belongs to the Lord but what will happen
[1:22:21] is there a a parent will take their they
[1:22:24] are firstborn and go to to the priest
[1:22:28] and then they will pay a Redemption
[1:22:30] money and then they will redeem their
[1:22:31] son back if not the son will be given
[1:22:35] over to the Lord now you remember that's
[1:22:38] what uh uh uh Hannah said because Samuel
[1:22:41] will be the first born that will that
[1:22:43] will come from her womb if you give him
[1:22:45] I will give him back to you because the
[1:22:47] first born Belongs to the Lord amen
[1:22:50] praise the Lord but so yeah so the the
[1:22:53] the levite
[1:22:55] they never had no physical inheritance
[1:22:57] they were all serving in in the house
[1:22:59] they were they were all not priests but
[1:23:02] they were all servants in the house they
[1:23:04] had different work to do the kites were
[1:23:07] the people that build the Tabernacle
[1:23:09] they get another tribe there they were
[1:23:11] the people that would take care of the
[1:23:12] things within the Tabernacle and then
[1:23:15] the ones that were born from uh the the
[1:23:19] the the family land of Aram they were
[1:23:21] the one that would be that would do the
[1:23:23] sacrifices go behind the veil let the
[1:23:25] candle kill the animal and all of that
[1:23:28] every one of them have their work praise
[1:23:30] the Lord amen now so uh because the
[1:23:35] Levites belong to the Lord and uh uh so
[1:23:39] they were supposed to benefit from the
[1:23:42] things that were offered to the Lord are
[1:23:45] we together amen I want you to grab this
[1:23:49] picture now so you will see when you
[1:23:52] read in the scripture when you go go
[1:23:54] back and you make uh uh a research go in
[1:23:58] your concordance take your phone or your
[1:24:00] your your your your iPad or whatever you
[1:24:04] have just make a Bible search on Widow
[1:24:07] when you go back you will realize there
[1:24:09] are many scripture back in the Old
[1:24:11] Testament where the Bible will says that
[1:24:14] uh the Bible would talk about the Weedle
[1:24:17] the the fatherless and the
[1:24:21] stranger praise the Lord now now the
[1:24:25] thing that brought stranger into the
[1:24:27] picture because Israel was a stranger in
[1:24:30] the land of Egypt so God will always
[1:24:33] tell them be kind to the stranger to
[1:24:37] remind yourself that you were a
[1:24:40] stranger praise the Lord and whether you
[1:24:43] like it or now we are all strangers and
[1:24:45] pagin amen praise the Lord unless you
[1:24:48] are making your home here praise the
[1:24:50] Lord you can buy your Bering part that's
[1:24:54] fine glory be to
[1:25:01] God now so you will see that God
[1:25:06] took special
[1:25:08] interest just in the
[1:25:12] same level where he took an interest in
[1:25:15] the Levites as being his portion he took
[1:25:18] an interest in a child that they not
[1:25:22] have parent
[1:25:24] praise the Lord he took an interest in a
[1:25:28] woman that was married and her husband D
[1:25:33] or a woman that do not have a
[1:25:37] husband are we
[1:25:39] together now watch and see where I'm
[1:25:41] going with this because you will
[1:25:43] appreciate
[1:25:46] it praise the
[1:25:49] Lord
[1:25:51] amen Leviticus 22
[1:25:55] Leviticus
[1:26:03] 22 you love the
[1:26:09] Lord Leviticus
[1:26:11] 22 before we get to Leviticus 22 Exodus
[1:26:16] 22:22 thou shall not afflect the widow
[1:26:18] or the fatherless child that's God
[1:26:21] speaking there in defense of the Widow
[1:26:24] and the
[1:26:25] fatherless praise the Lord amen another
[1:26:30] beautiful thing I saw while I studing
[1:26:31] this morning I was when I was just
[1:26:34] looking through some
[1:26:35] scripture it it came very beautiful I
[1:26:39] don't know if it will be beautiful to
[1:26:40] you but it was beautiful to me amen
[1:26:43] Leviticus chapter 22 if we want to look
[1:26:45] here closely you will see the Bible says
[1:26:48] here
[1:27:00] are we
[1:27:02] together
[1:27:17] amen let's read from verse 10 let's read
[1:27:21] from verse 10
[1:27:24] there shall No Stranger eat of the Holy
[1:27:26] thing a
[1:27:28] souljourner of the priest or a higher
[1:27:31] servant shall not eat of the Holy thing
[1:27:34] but if the priest buy and sold with his
[1:27:38] money he shall eat of it and he that is
[1:27:42] born in his house they shall eat of his
[1:27:45] meat if the priest's
[1:27:48] daughter if the priest's daughter also
[1:27:51] be married onto a Strang
[1:27:55] she shall not eat of an offering of the
[1:27:59] Holy thing listen to this now but if the
[1:28:03] priest's daughter be a widow or divorce
[1:28:07] praise the Lord and have no child now
[1:28:11] most of the time we frown at that the
[1:28:13] word divorce looks like a frowning word
[1:28:16] we frown at it but I I just pray that
[1:28:18] the Lord will help me let me not let me
[1:28:20] not go ahead of myself let me not go
[1:28:22] ahead of myself praise the Lord
[1:28:25] but let's let's look at this together if
[1:28:27] the priest's daughter be a
[1:28:30] widow or a divorce and have no child and
[1:28:35] is returned unto her father's house as
[1:28:39] in her youth underline that because it
[1:28:42] will come very important the next the
[1:28:45] next uh scripture we will read as in her
[1:28:47] youth she shall eat of her father's meat
[1:28:51] what what is her father's meat her
[1:28:53] father is a priest so she's returned
[1:28:55] back to to to to the house of her father
[1:28:58] praise the Lord
[1:29:02] amen but there shall No Stranger eat
[1:29:06] thereof now when I read this this
[1:29:08] morning as I was reading through the
[1:29:10] different scripture Luke Chapter 2 came
[1:29:13] to my mind let's go to Luke Chapter 2
[1:29:16] like I said we do a little bible studies
[1:29:18] and then uh I can be able to buy some
[1:29:21] time and then I'll share with you what
[1:29:23] we what we want to share with you this
[1:29:25] morning hope that it's a blessing praise
[1:29:27] the Lord Luke Chapter
[1:29:31] 2 if you keep the scripture that we have
[1:29:33] just read you will appreciate this part
[1:29:36] of Luke Chapter
[1:29:37] 2:36 Luke chapter 2 verse 36 the Bible
[1:29:41] will speak about this woman and it says
[1:29:45] now there was one Huna a
[1:29:48] prophetess the daughter of finel of the
[1:29:53] tribe of AA
[1:29:54] she she was of a great age and had live
[1:30:00] with her husband 7even years from her
[1:30:04] virginity which means she got married to
[1:30:06] him uh uh after seven years her husband
[1:30:10] died praise the
[1:30:12] Lord and she was a
[1:30:16] widow of about four score and 4 years SC
[1:30:23] is 20 so false quote is about 84 years
[1:30:27] so if you if you think about what we
[1:30:30] read in
[1:30:32] Leviticus when her husband died she
[1:30:35] returned back to her father's
[1:30:38] house praise the Lord because what is
[1:30:41] happening here this was when Jesus was
[1:30:44] dedicated when Jesus was born and he was
[1:30:47] brought to the temple to be dedicated oh
[1:30:50] Hanah was there in the temple praise the
[1:30:53] Lord the Bible says she was a prophetess
[1:30:56] so if if you take what Leviticus says
[1:30:58] and bring it back to Luke Hannah return
[1:31:02] back back to the Tabernacle choose not
[1:31:05] to get married and she stayed there from
[1:31:09] after that seven years with her husband
[1:31:12] until she was 84
[1:31:17] years praise the Lord amen that really
[1:31:21] blessed my heart this morning
[1:31:25] now so the picture here is there there
[1:31:30] these people the
[1:31:32] we the the the the the fatherless the
[1:31:37] offerers we call them and and the
[1:31:40] stranger they now became in some sense
[1:31:44] the responsibility of the
[1:31:48] priest the priest was supposed to take
[1:31:51] care of them now
[1:31:54] that is what I was
[1:31:58] missing the tie do not go directly to
[1:32:01] the Widow the tide goes to the priest
[1:32:04] because if you read in Deuteronomy
[1:32:07] chapter
[1:32:08] 6 chapter 26 the Bible says when you TI
[1:32:12] in you're tiing to the
[1:32:14] levite it first called the levite before
[1:32:17] it called the Widow and it called the
[1:32:20] fatherless praise the Lord so the people
[1:32:23] will bring their tith and offering to
[1:32:26] the storehouse to to to to the
[1:32:29] Tabernacle then the Levi will now take
[1:32:32] of that and now take care of the widows
[1:32:36] and take care of the offerings and take
[1:32:38] care of the The Strangers so you see
[1:32:41] when brother brandham said don't give
[1:32:43] your your tith to a widow it it means
[1:32:47] that you are not the one that's supposed
[1:32:49] to do
[1:32:51] it it's the responsibility of the
[1:32:59] priests praise the
[1:33:01] Lord
[1:33:04] amen should I should I repeat myself
[1:33:08] because that's the message that's the
[1:33:09] only message I'm preaching to you this
[1:33:11] morning if you didn't get it then
[1:33:13] service is
[1:33:15] over praise the Lord amen because the
[1:33:20] Levites was the heritage of God
[1:33:24] the fatherless do not have parents to
[1:33:27] take care of them so God takes
[1:33:30] responsibility amen the Widow does not
[1:33:33] have a husband so God takes
[1:33:36] responsibility and because the priest
[1:33:39] was his Heritage the priest takes the
[1:33:43] responsibility to take care of these
[1:33:46] people you will Now understand why
[1:33:49] Elijah went to the house of the Widow
[1:34:00] happy Mother's
[1:34:02] Day praise the
[1:34:04] Lord
[1:34:06] hallelujah happy Mother's
[1:34:15] Day when the Lord helped me to H
[1:34:17] understand that it was just like a cold
[1:34:20] water went over my body
[1:34:24] so I called the brother back I said
[1:34:26] brother you won't believe it man I says
[1:34:30] I says I says I said the Lord being so
[1:34:34] good and we talk on the phone he said
[1:34:37] brother one that is nothing but the
[1:34:39] truth he says that's exactly what it
[1:34:43] is that is just exactly the way it's
[1:34:47] supposed to be
[1:34:55] are we
[1:34:59] together you have taken all my
[1:35:03] inspiration praise the
[1:35:10] Lord are you are you getting the
[1:35:13] picture amen praise the
[1:35:17] Lord so you see that thou was the work
[1:35:20] of the priest
[1:35:23] he was to take care of these
[1:35:31] people glory be to God Amen now you you
[1:35:36] have to think about it you you think
[1:35:37] about it now you know in in in our word
[1:35:41] in our time our our tithes and offering
[1:35:44] is all money in their time it was not
[1:35:47] money it was all fresh fruit and fresh
[1:35:50] crops and you know and and livestock and
[1:35:53] all of that
[1:35:54] that if the if the priest will be
[1:35:57] greeted like many of us preachers are
[1:35:59] greeted he will end up with bunch of
[1:36:01] rotten fruits around him because how
[1:36:03] many will you eat before the next
[1:36:07] Harvest praise the Lord so you see then
[1:36:11] the priest goes out uh you know he goes
[1:36:13] and and and and you know they minister
[1:36:15] to all of these all of these uh uh
[1:36:17] widows you will see that's the reason
[1:36:19] why in the New Testament Church uh uh uh
[1:36:22] the Bible come comes up with uh the the
[1:36:25] qualification of a
[1:36:27] widow praise the Lord the New Testament
[1:36:30] Church comes up with the qualification
[1:36:32] of a widow because the New Testament
[1:36:33] Church was now under a New Covenant and
[1:36:37] and and uh if you if you look there Paul
[1:36:40] speaks about that you know one that is
[1:36:42] weedo uh uh that was taken care of by
[1:36:45] the church is is one that will wash the
[1:36:47] apostles
[1:36:49] feet praise the lord it's right there in
[1:36:52] the book of trothy he says the one that
[1:36:54] is considered Widow is one that is that
[1:36:56] will wash the apostles Fe what does that
[1:36:58] mean which mean that uh she's partaking
[1:37:00] of
[1:37:04] communion are we
[1:37:09] together now so let's go into our
[1:37:13] message we want to talk about this

[1:38:24] forget about your question just write it
[1:38:26] down and then we will be able to revisit
[1:38:28] it amen but let's go to our talk this
[1:38:30] morning I just have a few minutes here
[1:38:33] and uh uh now we talking about this and
[1:38:36] and and and that was the thing that kind
[1:38:38] of caught my attention year you know
[1:38:40] because if uh if if you remember many
[1:38:43] years back uh uh what a year or
[1:38:45] somewhere else I preach a message on why
[1:38:47] Elijah had to go to a Widow's
[1:38:50] house and I was I brought that message
[1:38:52] from another another standpoint than
[1:38:54] where I'm coming from uh this this
[1:38:57] morning because what I'm coming from
[1:39:00] this morning is to be able to show us
[1:39:02] how God has allowed us to walk on the
[1:39:06] pages of the Bible praise the Lord amen
[1:39:10] God has allowed us you know many people
[1:39:13] don't understand why you know why we we
[1:39:16] believe what we believe in what we stand
[1:39:18] for what we stand for and and I tell
[1:39:21] people uh I mean that this this thing is
[1:39:24] not an American gospel it's not about
[1:39:26] one one white man from Kentucky this
[1:39:29] message is all about fulfilled
[1:39:33] scripture praise the Lord It's All About
[1:39:35] fulfilled scripture it's not about a man
[1:39:39] there's only one man one mediator
[1:39:41] between man and God that's the man
[1:39:43] Christ Jesus praise the Lord you see but
[1:39:47] God by his grace has been able to throw
[1:39:49] so much light on the word uh that we can
[1:39:53] say that we are walking where the
[1:39:55] apostles have thr amen we are walking
[1:39:58] where the apostles have thr so this
[1:40:01] morning as we look at uh Elijah the Tish
[1:40:04] bear we will realize that this was a
[1:40:07] time a time of farming Elijah has just
[1:40:11] left the Brooks you have to remember
[1:40:13] that Elijah has gone down there and he
[1:40:16] told the king Ahab that there will not
[1:40:19] be deal neither rain will fall until I
[1:40:22] call for it amen amen praise the Lord he
[1:40:25] said that on
[1:40:27] inspiration not even knowing H H uh uh
[1:40:31] how the whole thing is going to come to
[1:40:33] pass praise the Lord but the Bible says
[1:40:36] that uh James would tell us in the Bible
[1:40:39] that Elijah prayed earnestly amen Elijah
[1:40:44] prayed earnestly Jesus himself would
[1:40:47] testify about that that Elijah prayed
[1:40:51] earnestly that there should be no rain
[1:40:53] until he called for it actually it was 3
[1:40:56] years and 6
[1:40:58] months when you look through the
[1:41:01] scripture now so when that happened the
[1:41:04] Lord told Elijah to get by the Brooks
[1:41:07] The Brooks of charot he was going to
[1:41:09] send a raven to feel Elijah so God will
[1:41:13] send that bird the bird will bring some
[1:41:15] food and and Elijah was there by the
[1:41:18] Brooks he would eat and the the Brooks
[1:41:20] was a stream of water he would drink but
[1:41:23] because the the the the farming has gone
[1:41:27] on for all of that why the water
[1:41:31] cease the broke was not running again it
[1:41:34] dry
[1:41:35] up and then God will now come and tell
[1:41:38] Elijah to get up and go to zarapa there
[1:41:42] is a widow woman there a widow woman
[1:41:46] praise the Lord
[1:41:49] amen a widow woman a woman can only be a
[1:41:53] WI be a woman when her husband passed
[1:41:55] away praise the
[1:41:57] lord it's a it's a it's a place in life
[1:42:02] that uh
[1:42:04] uh uh it's not one of those things that
[1:42:08] we desire like a
[1:42:11] graduation is not one of the things that
[1:42:13] we desire uh uh like an expectation of a
[1:42:17] CH but it's one of the things that God
[1:42:21] in his sovereignty has designed
[1:42:24] praise the Lord
[1:42:27] amen and uh and and as we as we look in
[1:42:30] the word this morning just like a h h h
[1:42:34] trying to make you to see that God took
[1:42:38] uh the the the the the fatherless the
[1:42:42] Widow he took them just as much as he
[1:42:46] took the Levites as his
[1:42:48] own praise the Lord it means that God uh
[1:42:53] they they are special to God why because
[1:42:57] God is the one that designed their
[1:43:01] situation praise the Lord he's the one
[1:43:04] that designed that situation for the
[1:43:07] child to to lost their
[1:43:12] parent praise the
[1:43:15] Lord you will never know what it
[1:43:19] is until you have to live through it
[1:43:23] praise the
[1:43:25] Lord talking to one Young Brother one
[1:43:27] time he say sir he say he said he say
[1:43:30] brother one yeah I know what it is for

[1:43:42] don't know you think you know but you
[1:43:44] don't
[1:43:45] know praise the
[1:43:47] Lord you have to wear the shoes to know
[1:43:50] what it is
[1:43:54] you are just
[1:43:56] assuming praise the Lord that's the same
[1:43:59] way you were assumed for the life of of
[1:44:02] of an orphan child or you were swn for
[1:44:05] the life of a of a of a widow woman or a
[1:44:08] widower a man that lost his
[1:44:15] wife is God that choose
[1:44:18] that it's God that designed it
[1:44:23] and when God
[1:44:25] design our path in life he makes
[1:44:29] provision for
[1:44:33] it praise the Lord he makes provision
[1:44:37] for
[1:44:38] it the Apostle Paul will say he don't
[1:44:40] give us no trial that we cannot
[1:44:44] be and even in the midst of that he stay
[1:44:47] made a way of Escape
[1:44:53] praise the
[1:44:54] Lord
[1:45:00] amen it's one of those things that you
[1:45:02] can never plan
[1:45:04] for no child plan that I have to make a
[1:45:09] plan the day I lost my father and my
[1:45:10] mother no child plan for
[1:45:15] that even the thought of it is very
[1:45:19] scary just to think it in your mind
[1:45:23] is very
[1:45:25] scary praise the
[1:45:28] Lord if it is entertaining to you you
[1:45:30] must get you to the
[1:45:36] police
[1:45:38] amen you need
[1:45:42] help if you are entertaining the thought
[1:45:44] to get rid of your father and mother we
[1:45:46] must get you to the police that's what
[1:45:48] I'm saying
[1:45:56] so you see there one of these things in
[1:46:00] life that as life goes on we don't think
[1:46:04] about
[1:46:06] it praise the
[1:46:11] lord we don't think about
[1:46:16] it I was reading uh the story of uh of
[1:46:21] John Sheriff if you remember remember
[1:46:23] his story he's he a man down there in
[1:46:26] Arizona became a very wealthy man and uh
[1:46:29] if you if you ever heard the story about
[1:46:31] the grifted vine the the tree that was
[1:46:34] bringing different fruits that brother
[1:46:35] Bram talk about he was the one that
[1:46:37] planted that he later on became a very
[1:46:40] wealthy man but this this man he he got
[1:46:44] his
[1:46:45] wealth from uh from a scriptural pattern
[1:46:55] I've learned his dad used to support
[1:46:57] missionaries and his dad pass away and
[1:47:01] at one time a missionary came to came to
[1:47:03] town you know started started work down
[1:47:06] there and and John being a young boy
[1:47:08] young young man he went and offered his
[1:47:10] place to the missionary took his young
[1:47:13] wife you know and and you know have the
[1:47:15] missionary to take his little place and
[1:47:17] start the work and all of that you know
[1:47:20] and then he went on and and uh took his
[1:47:23] mother after his dad passed away and he
[1:47:26] started taking care of his widow mama
[1:47:29] and uh uh and then uh uh later on as the
[1:47:33] Lord will remember the kindness of uh of
[1:47:36] John he uh uh uh he took the thought to
[1:47:42] start uh uh uh uh helping
[1:47:47] widows praise the Lord he took a thought
[1:47:50] to start helping widows and brother B
[1:47:52] will talk about about how God will bless
[1:47:54] him and you will never know of what what
[1:47:57] a millionaire he
[1:48:01] was it's a special
[1:48:03] thing it's a very special
[1:48:07] thing it's a very special thing
[1:48:10] people all of these uh uh uh uh you know
[1:48:15] uh uh blessing seeking gospel that we
[1:48:18] preach you know s seeds and you know do
[1:48:20] this and and all of that and and we we
[1:48:23] we have we have uh you know uh make up
[1:48:25] our own way how how we think that God
[1:48:27] will bless us and what we need to do and
[1:48:30] uh you know uh uh uh uh put the cross up
[1:48:34] and put this up and all of that they are
[1:48:36] very simple
[1:48:38] principle in the word of
[1:48:41] God praise the Lord very very simple
[1:48:45] principle if God can be able to inspire
[1:48:48] the heart of a man to be able to tap
[1:48:50] into death it take God just the snap of
[1:48:53] a finger to turn your life around and
[1:48:56] bless
[1:48:57] you
[1:48:59] amen it is because we we are we we are
[1:49:02] trying to come up with our own you know
[1:49:05] that sometimes it's hard for us to be
[1:49:07] able to see what we're actually the Lord
[1:49:09] want us to look but let's look into our
[1:49:11] scripture now we we we see here now
[1:49:13] Elijah had to go to this widow woman
[1:49:17] house and and and we read from the
[1:49:19] scripture when he went to the widow
[1:49:21] woman house you have to realize
[1:49:23] that at first that definitely the woman
[1:49:26] recognized that this man was a man of
[1:49:28] God praise the Lord amen and uh uh and
[1:49:32] Elijah got there and he told the woman
[1:49:36] the first thing he asked the woman was
[1:49:38] for the woman to give him water she
[1:49:40] never you know she never it didn't
[1:49:42] bother her she you have to realize that
[1:49:45] this is a time of
[1:49:46] farming you know nobody is planting
[1:49:50] there is no Harvest everybody is keeping
[1:49:53] what they have close to
[1:49:55] them praise the Lord everybody is
[1:49:59] keeping what they have close to them we
[1:50:02] live in a country where there is Surplus
[1:50:06] amen there is Surplus you can get it
[1:50:08] anywhere Walmart Target anywhere you can
[1:50:11] get it so sometimes the picture of that
[1:50:14] don't become real to
[1:50:15] us but when you go to places like Gaza
[1:50:19] this morning where people are running
[1:50:20] away from their life you go to places
[1:50:22] like like Ukraine where bumps is going
[1:50:25] over and you don't have the the freedom
[1:50:28] to be able to go to work and go to a
[1:50:30] grocery Center you go into water places
[1:50:34] you have the picture of what farming
[1:50:37] is praise the Lord you have a bottle of
[1:50:41] water you drink it
[1:50:43] sparingly you just don't drink half you
[1:50:45] leave you just drink the top and leave
[1:50:47] the other one standing right out there
[1:50:49] you go and take another bottle again and
[1:50:51] drink and leave it standing there why
[1:50:53] because you have
[1:50:55] enough this was a time of
[1:50:58] farming everything they have was
[1:51:01] precious to them everything they have
[1:51:04] was uh you know H that they have to use
[1:51:07] it they have to calculate for this woman
[1:51:10] to tell Elijah that I only making two
[1:51:14] sticks I have two sticks just to make
[1:51:17] enough
[1:51:18] meal for my son and myself so we can eat
[1:51:23] and commit our life to
[1:51:25] God praise the Lord you can tell me that
[1:51:29] God sent Elijah to that house because of
[1:51:33] Elijah she only had for she and her son
[1:51:36] that was their last meal they were going
[1:51:39] to eat and commit themselves to
[1:51:43] death so do did they need Elijah or
[1:51:47] Elijah needed them
[1:51:53] praise the
[1:51:55] Lord am I Lord C in the eyes why will he
[1:52:00] go to the house of a woman that that
[1:52:02] just have her
[1:52:05] last she went there because it was his
[1:52:09] duty as a priest to take care of
[1:52:12] her praise the
[1:52:15] Lord he was supposed to take care of
[1:52:19] her but he will not be a blessing to her
[1:52:22] on until she realized who that man of
[1:52:24] God
[1:52:28] was praise the Lord are we
[1:52:36] together now so when you look into you
[1:52:40] you look into the word the the the
[1:52:43] scripture say he went there and asked
[1:52:44] the woman fesch me some water to
[1:52:49] drink it did not trouble her I believe
[1:52:51] also
[1:52:53] she didn't had enough water she might
[1:52:55] have had just few few bottles or few
[1:52:57] gallons of water that was not so much of
[1:53:00] a b to her the Bible say she woke up to
[1:53:03] get the water then he call her back and
[1:53:06] said woman FES me some meal to
[1:53:09] eat praise the
[1:53:12] Lord she says
[1:53:19] sir what I have is the last
[1:53:23] I was just about to go and
[1:53:27] make enough for my son and myself so we
[1:53:30] can eat and
[1:53:33] die praise the
[1:53:38] Lord don't you see God do you see
[1:53:40] Jehovah Jara she was just to face the
[1:53:44] last for her to eat and
[1:53:46] die and Jehovah jarra comes on the scene
[1:53:52] embodied In the Flesh of an old
[1:53:54] baldheaded
[1:53:57] Prophet praise the Lord he comes on the
[1:54:00] S and says face me first go and do what
[1:54:03] you are going to do but face me

[1:57:17] take care of them

[1:57:25] different is that we appreciate what

[2:24:02] she P
[2:24:05] $50
[2:24:09] $50 are we
[2:24:11] together praise the
[2:24:13] Lord back in the assistance $50 for a
[2:24:18] woman that is worth working by watching
[2:24:25] clothes how much it might have taken her
[2:24:27] to have save that
[2:24:30] money but ban says he says no I will not
[2:24:33] allow her to do
[2:24:35] that praise the
[2:24:37] Lord you'll find out why this had to
[2:24:41] happen in h White
[2:24:42] House and if you read and just look in
[2:24:45] between the line in the message you will
[2:24:47] see why brother bham was so attached to
[2:24:49] this family
[2:24:52] and some of the things that were
[2:24:53] happening we don't have all all all to
[2:24:56] say to you here but just like what Moses
[2:24:59] described in the house of uh uh uh he
[2:25:02] says every time I go hunting I always
[2:25:05] bring something for
[2:25:08] hi he will always bring something a meat
[2:25:12] and Order of that take it to the house
[2:25:23] so he said I saw her take her $50 she
[2:25:26] says $50 he said okay I know what I
[2:25:28] would do and uh uh H uh MAA gave me $20
[2:25:32] to go and buy something he said I put
[2:25:34] the $20 I had two $10 bill he says I
[2:25:37] would just go buy the house and give it
[2:25:39] to
[2:25:40] her because $50 that was too much of her
[2:25:43] money for that woman too much of a money
[2:25:47] Jesus said when he looked in the tra
[2:25:52] treasury he
[2:25:54] said all of those
[2:25:57] Rich they put from their riches they
[2:26:01] took from their
[2:26:03] riches but the
[2:26:07] widow she took all she
[2:26:10] has it's not the
[2:26:13] amount praise the Lord is not the amount
[2:26:17] that we gave is the one that we don't
[2:26:22] give praise the lord it's not what we
[2:26:25] gave it's what we don't give because you
[2:26:28] realize that God the money the offering
[2:26:32] that is collected here we don't ship it
[2:26:33] to
[2:26:35] Heaven brother stepen don't PST it to
[2:26:37] Heaven it's only used to take care of
[2:26:40] the needs of the church that's what it's
[2:26:43] used for praise the Lord so without with
[2:26:47] with your money without your money God
[2:26:49] will still move his church but beyond
[2:26:52] what we give is what we don't give
[2:26:55] because what God really need and your
[2:26:57] money he needs you he needs you to be on
[2:27:01] the altar more than your
[2:27:06] money praise the
[2:27:08] Lord he needs you to be on he really
[2:27:12] wants you he could do more with you than
[2:27:15] your
[2:27:19] money it's not what we gave it's what we
[2:27:22] are not
[2:27:24] giving it's what we keep holding
[2:27:32] back and see what he says
[2:27:35] here that's why I said we walking on the
[2:27:38] path of
[2:27:42] scripture he said brother Robertson
[2:27:45] wouldn't take
[2:27:46] it we only let her give 20
[2:27:50] and I said
[2:27:52] myself when uh she's speaking I give I I
[2:27:56] will give it back I give back 20 but God
[2:27:59] said to me in my heart Now by The Vision
[2:28:03] in my heart when Jesus was standing
[2:28:05] watching the Widow Port the three penny
[2:28:09] where there was a thousands of dollars
[2:28:12] laying what what will you have done I
[2:28:17] said well if I did be stand turning
[2:28:20] around says we don't need it sister we
[2:28:24] got plenty of money now so so what is
[2:28:27] happening here is that with what he have
[2:28:30] seen thinking about how he can give this
[2:28:33] poor woman her money back God is now
[2:28:36] also dealing with him in the line of
[2:28:40] scripture praise the Lord amen because
[2:28:44] even though it's the priest
[2:28:46] responsibility to take care of the the
[2:28:49] offering and the widows and the
[2:28:50] strangers but you have to realize is
[2:28:53] it's more God
[2:28:55] responsibility praise the Lord God can
[2:28:58] take care of them the area that the
[2:29:01] priest
[2:29:02] can praise the Lord God can take care of
[2:29:06] their emotions he can take care of their
[2:29:09] sanity he can take care of the the place
[2:29:12] that the priest is just supposed to be a
[2:29:15] sense of
[2:29:17] comfort a sense of support
[2:29:21] praise the Lord if you go to the New
[2:29:23] Testament you will realize that Jesus
[2:29:26] rebuked the Pharisees why because they
[2:29:29] were abusing that Jesus says it it's
[2:29:32] your responsibility to take the wi he
[2:29:34] said but what you are doring them you
[2:29:37] are taking of what they have and you're
[2:29:40] not giving them anything in
[2:29:43] return you are just subjecting them to
[2:29:47] traditions and creeds
[2:29:52] you are making them two times children
[2:29:54] of
[2:29:58] hell because if a weow is coming and
[2:30:01] taking her weow mind and and some you
[2:30:03] must be able to give her something that
[2:30:06] will give her a hope for a resurrection
[2:30:08] you must give her a gospel that will
[2:30:10] give her strength to go on day after
[2:30:18] day are we together
[2:30:22] so God is dealing with his Prophet yet
[2:30:24] and says what would you have done if you
[2:30:27] were there what would you do he said
[2:30:29] well I will tell her sister we get
[2:30:31] thousands of dollars we don't need your
[2:30:32] money he says but Jesus never did
[2:30:37] that Jesus never did there why what what
[2:30:41] was God doing God wanted for this man of
[2:30:44] God to see I'm going to reward that
[2:30:47] woman praise the Lord all you are doing
[2:30:50] is just a support but I am her rewarder
[2:30:53] I'm going to reward her and don't stop
[2:30:56] her blessing if she's giving all I'm
[2:30:58] ready to give back to
[2:31:04] her oh praise the Lord the word is so
[2:31:08] sweet when you see the word the word of
[2:31:10] God walking in your day and scripture
[2:31:13] being made manifest in your day it
[2:31:16] becomes so sweet to serve the Lord
[2:31:21] the thing that makes it hard to serve
[2:31:22] the Lord because we trying to follow
[2:31:24] scripture of 2,000 years when God is
[2:31:27] foring that very word in our
[2:31:33] day glory be to
[2:31:36] God
[2:31:38] Amen he says Jesus never Jesus never
[2:31:43] said it help me God he says as my
[2:31:47] sovereign jurge God knew that
[2:31:50] that was down the road for her he said
[2:31:53] God knew that was down the road for her

[2:31:57] the road the salvation of her sons God
