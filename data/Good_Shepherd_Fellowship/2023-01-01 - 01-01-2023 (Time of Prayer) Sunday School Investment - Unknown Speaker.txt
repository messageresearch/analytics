TRANSCRIPT
========================================
group that seems to be a petty thing to you and some little bright shiny something that you grab for and if I happen to reach out for the for the word or something like that my state presbyter put me out or my Bishop will throw me out why if you come to God you're gonna be thrown out anyhow so what's the difference I'd rather be if you're throwed out you'll throw it in so that's it there's three things God always deals in threes we know that he's perfected in threes remember in the days of Noah they went in they are and in the days of Sodom Jesus was speaking of these two days of Silent they went out they went in and those time went out and and uh sodom's time and they go up and this time let's go in go out go up that's what we need now we need a going-up affair we need a going up from these things and worldly things that's got us so bound down Daniel wasn't going to defile himself and watch he was going to keep that word in a place so it could flow through the word want to do it's set down an angel it protected his life he didn't admire himself the Hebrew children was determined they said all the rest of them are bound when the flute sound and when the Bishops say stalton they holler froggy they jump but he said we're not going to do it you my Duchess you're able to burn us up you're able to kick us out you're able to do this without the other but we're not bowing down to your image anyhow amen there wasn't only in the defile their investment is going to be the word and the word that's going to stand on and when a Time come to make a decision there's going to stand by the word save their lives they had a fourth man down there there's anything that we need this morning is that fourth man among us that's right that's right that now now Peter one time he was a he was nothing but a fisherman he had a business a fisherman but you know what he saw something in Jesus Christ that his father you know his father Jonas was a a great man he was a fisherman now just to give a little drama here just before we close that in the next few minutes we just came inside you're 11 we're trying to be through 11 30 you can stand a little longer so we we'll go ahead and I know Jonas might have said to his son just a little drama when he take him and Andrew on their left his gray hair shiny guy through a days of fishing more that had to trust ever a day for their daily bread and I can see him sit there and say my son listen Simon there there will be a time I always wanted to see the Messiah and we've always believed that because we're promised one but uh listen Simon my son there will be a lot of bogus things rise up and there was before the real Messiah comes but said you know this Messiah Simon because he'll be exactly with the scripture and all the rest of them will be against him see but this Messiah will prove it because we are Jews we are taught to believe those prophets because the Lord God told us that everyone's spiritual among you uh or a prophet I the Lord will speak to him in visions and what he says will come to pass then you'll know that that man's a prophet and the Moses told us that our Messiah would be a prophet and you watch him now we haven't had one for hundreds and hundreds of years but being knowing that after the Old Gentleman passed away one day Andrew staggered off down to Europe a man speaking that was prophesying of a coming Messiah and after a while this Messiah come on the scene and night uh John who was looking for him saw the god sign coming down Jehovah the God speaking with a voice and in the shape of a dove lighting upon him and the voice saying this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to dwell in in whom I'm pleased to dwell the same way just turn the verb for the adverts now in whom I'm pleased to dwell in her pleased to to be dwelling in he has satisfied me he's did just what uh uh know that he should he should do and what I said that he would do nah and when Peter say or meets Andrew saying there he saw his soul he saw Jesus the next they said Rabbi Lord dwelleth I said come see so then he went and told his brother after staying with him all night the next morning he's fully persuaded that was Messiah and the next morning he went to get his brother and he brought he said come on we found the Messiah I can imagine Simon saying now wait just a minute I'm a commercial fisherman here I'm a I'm a Pharisee up here I'll Sprout the same church my daddy did and I've had all this Messiah stuff all over but wait a minute Simon do you remember the teaching of our of our word you remember what oh yeah I know you've seen all this stuff I didn't dad for tell us that all this stuff with glamor would come up but that wouldn't be it but we would know he'd be a scriptural man you say with the word because he will be the word so they just couldn't understand that so Simon walks up and said well I guess I'll go see and as soon as he come into the presence of Jesus now he left off a day's fishing of his Daily Bread he was a businessman you see and so uh he uh come to this meeting and in this he walks up and when Jesus laid his eyes upon him he said behold an Israelite in whom there is no God see look I'm sorry I quoted the wrong man here's what he said he said your name is Simon and you are the son of Jonas then Peter took out a policy see he made an investment right there not only did he know who he was he know that Godly old father that is I mean what would happen and he seen the word Vindicated that Rich Young Ruler might have been standing to see that same thing but Peter was ready to sell out his business and his membership and make an investment he'd done something to him how about Nathaniel had this Grove out there like you have here in Phoenix and and one day he's out there and he's a Bible student and when Philip saw this done run over and told he said hey we found the Messiah who Moses spoke of he said now Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph he said now could there be any good thing come out of such a place that I've looked would you say with Jesus and Ezra I looked over every one of our presenters none of them had said nothing about him we don't have any school Seminary you come from no did you know all the way down through the Bible the prophets that rose up we don't know where they come from no background to them they just moved on the scene and moved off just the same way they had no experiences back somewhere they'd come to bring the people that got out Loose and bring them ages back and tied into the Bible again see or didn't Moses come from a humble parent we just know his parents know nothing of his background look at Elijah we don't even know he's popping mama was just put on the scene look at over there look at the other rest of them look at Amos we spoke of the other night no one know where he come from he's a herdsman that's all we know you just come on the scene yet when he finished his work like the great Elijah God give him a chair ride right into heaven see we don't know where they come from they have no schools or backgrounds God just raises them up to slam that word back and they don't have any denominational ties to time and say you have to do this or put them out look at even John the Baptist that great noted Prophet even in a lineage of a priest but he never went to his daddy's schools he had to introduce the Messiah he couldn't wait or Dr Jones sure he's a fine man you know you recognize him as Messiah he couldn't be persuaded with a bunch of man like that he went into the Wilderness because his his job was important and he stayed out there until he heard from God and he knowed what he would be and when he saw him coming he said there's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world the rest of them never seen nothing but he saw it Daniel he was kind of a surprise but when he walked up he told him about what he had said to Peter said you know that we are students of the scripture we know that Messiah be a prophet so when he come on the scene while he walked up to him and he said um I walk up in the congregation and Jesus looked up along and said behold an Israelite and whom there's no God he said Rabbi when did you know me said before Philip calls you when you were under the tree in a prayer meeting Heather I saw you what eyes and right there he made an investment what did he do right before his Rabbi priests and everything he admitted his hypocrisy he fell on his feet and off his feet to his knees and said rather hard the Son of God you are the king of Israel when many of those hot class men stood around there and all their farms and things and said this man's Beelzebub and Jesus told him they were blaspheming calling the spirit of God an evil thing see certainly oh my the little woman at the well what about her she certainly had an investment when she come out there in all of her immorals the church that got her in such a place so she didn't know where she was and so she just went to prostitution but her simple humble heart this may be a great word I want you to take it right she was predestinated eternal life all the father has given me will come she had to come for water she got us but not from Jacob's Well see no man can come except the father calls him first and all he's giving me will come I'll raise him up against the last days those who he foreign Justified those who Justified he Sanctified or already he's glorified watch when that word sign and word scriptural of vindication fell upon those rabbis and Priests they said this man's the devil but when he fell upon that little prostitute what happened quit his face to life them Rabbi said this man has the telepathy this man is a a fortune teller that's where you can tell those people he's a fortune teller but as soon as I struck that little prostitute in that condition if it could alarm that prostitute in that condition what order does it do to the Pentecostal Church who claims to have the Holy Ghost well if it don't go over your hand what were it to do to us but as soon as it flystone then Susan flashed on the little woman she never said you are a you're a Beelzebub look at her she said sir I perceive you're a prophet now we are no we know we're looking for one to come we have that Prophet for hundreds of years but we know that the Messiah is going to be a prophet we are here tell us these things when he comes Jesus said I'm he now she know a man that could tell her that would certainly be honest because he had the word the word was with him for the word come to the prophet he had the true interpretation of it for he was the word and as soon as a stalker he was interested in a policy right away she wanted an investment right quick he wants some of that water that she didn't have to come to the well to draw and as soon as she seated it set her harder fire down into the city she went said come see a man who's told me the things I've done isn't this the very Messiah isn't this what Messiah is supposed to be and the Bible said that the people of the city believed Jesus because what he had done to that woman her testimony calls that City attorney I've never done any Miracles you know what Philip was coming down to do that so like John never had any Miracles God Jesus is going to follow him now we find out that that they invested in this policy right away let me take just another two if you would pardon me a minute a few Nicodemus one day admitted the truth no he come by night to make an investment and he found the bank was open it's always open he thought well the bank's doing business all through the day for this uh Investments but I believe I'll go by the night and but he found it open ready and he said Rabbi we know that God a man sent from God no man could do these things like you're doing except God be with him that's totally impossible see he admitted there to the whole denominational world that they know it was so but for prejudice and pride and social popularity of the day just like that rich young kid did for Prestige and social understandings and they didn't want to give up the world just as act like this nation the Lord a Godly Man up there to correct us that's the reason we're wormy with Communism they won't take a Godly Man they'll elect somebody that can let them live any way they want to it's easy for us Americans and US Christians to say that but when we come down in now let's talk and bring it back home once you church members wants the same thing you want some preacher are you women are not condemn you for the way you dress and live somebody that'll catch you people on the back and tell you that you can do this that and the other and you can act like the world and live like the world and still maintain your confession of Christ to get a man like that in there it's the desire it's the spirit of the nation it's a spirit of the last days I want to confess and hold your confession on this I'm Pentecost I'm Methodist Baptist and still holding that and live any way you want to Jezebel and the country the same way but God sent him a pastor Elijah was her pastor well she wouldn't admit it but he was anyhow certainly God was able to be stones to Rochester and Abraham God don't have to come to your group or no other group God he does what he wants to and he will one thing he cannot do that's deny his own word so Nicodemus team and he want to make an investment and he found just what he is asking for he was sincere he found it we ought to hurry Luke 24 49 there have been a group of people had made an investment and Jesus told him in Luke 24 49 that 120 you go up there to the day of Pentecost up there and wait until you're in due with power going high I'm going to send you some interest on this it found him how do you take just that group how do you take that little Groove one day when he had a Ministry of Healing The Sick and showing his messiahship while everybody oh wonderful Rabbi oh come over to our church hold a meeting here Rabbi we want you over here we want you over here and a great group began to follow him but one day that God changed that Ministry in him from Miracles to the teaching of the word let's read between the lines you're not that blind if it is you lay a pencil between your eyes and put your eyes out notice notice the pencil that would write the word of God notice as soon as God sees his ministry from his miracles his miracles went on but not like that he began to tell him the straight scripture truth and where he was standing the crowd walked away from us this is a hard saying what happened the 70 that was following him he had ordained walked away too said who can understand a thing like this that's all against everything we've ever taught what happened and he turned to the 12 and said you want to go too that's when Peter said that wonderful word Lord where would we go tell me something better oh God have mercy where can you find any Creed that's better than the word of God where can you find any love that's deeper than the love of Jesus Christ where can you find any satisfaction deeper than the satisfaction Jesus Christ gives what makes you do the things to do is because you're it shows an emptiness [Music] thank you foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music]
