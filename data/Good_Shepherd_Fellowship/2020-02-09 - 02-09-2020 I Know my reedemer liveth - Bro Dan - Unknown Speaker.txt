or thirty eight months hanging over your head doctor being released and then not long after that the cordon told him to go home he didn't belong there price you know we are saving a living God I wouldn't take too much of the time had a few change to say concerning that but as God gives us grace you know all the talking about it so let's just go into the word because a lot of time is being spent already musicians god bless you so very much can take your seats shall we turn to job 19 job 19 we are reading from 25 to 27 job 19 25 to 27 I read for I know that my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me praise be to God shall we free our Lord and our Savior Jesus wait thank this so much old God for having made this day possible when we woke up this morning it was snowing so heavily and already there was about three four inches in the driveway so I started wondering what I will have church at all but here we are purely by your grace we are so thankful Lord that you have gathered us again for whenever we come together we know something special is going to happen what exactly we may not even think of but we know something is bound to happen we are so grateful father for as many as you have gathered this morning to lift you up for your wealth says that if you be lifted off you will draw all men on today and your word is true coming honor yourself father in our mister day a lot of our brothers and sisters have not been able to make it but I believe they're with us in spirits they may be listening online father just bless us touch every heart touch every soul open every eye to behold you and open every ear to hear you speak we are trusting in your grace this hour that you glorify yourself in our so glad we thank you for this faith who is not feeling fine we also remember before dear brother zekiel and as many as I know feeling free in the household of God Father let your healing virtue flow through them heal them inside out and oxide in thank you Jesus and praise be to the Holy Name for the miracles that have wrought in our lives in Jesus name Amen shall we seated praise be to God I know my Redeemer liveth this was the same one the Prophet preached and I talked about this somewhere last year July in Iowa City and I just pray God that somehow God would touch every heart and would touch every soul and I would speak to you personally praise be to God I know my redeemer liveth praise be to God now I want to take the word radium to redeem is to gain or to regain possession of something in exchange for payment and some of the synonyms I got where retrieve to regain to recover to reclaim to repossess in other ways you are taking back something that once belonged to you if it wasn't yours in the first place you couldn't redeem it you are regaining possession because once it was in your possession and I always like to use this analogy about a pawn shop operator that you think about maybe you got so broke and you need money and then you look all around you there is no way to make money and all you can think of is that beautiful ring your wife put on your finger or your husband put on your on your finger that day you stood before the congregation I said I do I do praise be to God and then you look at it it's worth probably ten thousand dollars but you are so broke you just need something small to manage and then you go to this pawnshop operator and say you know what I need some money he says yes I can't give you money what do you have as a collateral oh I have my ring I can give it's okay hey loser the ring $10,000 so okay you know what I'm going to give you three thousand and then you are going to pay me back four thousand dollars to get your ring but you say yes I agree I give the ring out I make sure all that while my wife doesn't even see that finger praise be to God yes and I take this money now even though I have lost possession of the Ring the pawnshop operator who is keeping the ring has no authority over the ring to sell it he can go ahead Stan and propose the woman was to marry I don't care what he can never take the ring to put a name on another person even though the ring is not in my possession I have authority over it and whosoever has their ring in their possession does not have authority over right once I get our money I go I pay I take my ring back oh when I'm so broken I can't even get it back somebody can just go to the pawn shop operator do you know Daniel he said yes I know him very well he also money here I'm here to pay for it and now to take the ring it's a okay I agree you can pay for it but I can't give you for the ring but it's okay to pay for it you can carry the receipt to him let him come and take his ring I campaign go and her brother Daniel but you know you can vote for your ring because it's been paid for once he gets there is just nice to be nice Elsa can be so rude to him go there and take my ring and wouldn't even say goodbye why because it is mine praise be to God just keep this at the back of your mind because we are coming back to it my Redeemer liveth the Bible says that when the children of God gathered together to present themselves to God the devil also came to present himself to God it was a chiral of God like we have gathered this morning to present ourselves to God to praise God and guess what the devil is here today what I was in good we had to postpone service but I bet you he didn't wait till 11 o clock when we're coming in he was here long before we came we are here to praise God to worship God to tell God how much we love him for what he has done for us to lift him up to bless him but that is not why the devil is here the devil is here to counter what we are here to do their double is our enemy the devil is no friend if you wonder why some people come to church and when the weather buddy's been priests they get offended is because the devil is here if you wonder why people come to church and when the waiter buddy's been priest under the poor Indian notion of the Word of God and this sit down in this slip is their devil the devil doesn't want you to get blessed and in a way the devil is going to get the word over your head he will do it if the devil cannot stop you from coming to church and you have made it here his next duty is to make sure that you leave here and go home without in a blessing so if he can cause you to slip he would do it it is the reason why sometimes you can be seated in church and your mind is out of here you are thinking of the bills thinking of some partido be taking place tonight thinking of some something outside here you are bodily present but spiritually you are absent that is the devil he is not here for the same reason that we are here and guess what the devil knows the weight the devil knows the weight remember when he tempted Jesus after his forty day fast he quoted him a scripture when he told him to cast himself and he angels would be there to take charge Alesi touch his feet against the stone he was caught in a scripture from the Book of Psalms so it tells you that it takes more than knowing a scripture to do the will of God because they double knows it it takes more than here in the word to do the will of God blessed is he that he assemblance I see that with it that is blessing in here in it but the more blessing lies in doing it praise be to God their double here's the word they know the scripture yet he can't Levite it they dare the devil begins to live by the way he has become our brother he's no longer our enemy that is why you have to do an introspection examine your life it is not okay to come and hear the word of God and not do it and not defy it hear the word give yourself to the word live by it let it become your absolute praise be to God for a man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God it's just this body that is feeding on them on the food we eat your real sub which is your soul feeds are nothing by the word and think about it how many times we have stabbed God we have start our souls stop our souls to death and Acura but I come to present a surfboard and the devil was there for a contrary objective don't take this for granted and God asked him what I do in here is Geron of gotta have come what are you doing here I said I've been worried to and fro up and down helter skelter all around the body the devil is a busybody and God asked him have you considered that of all the men on earth there is none like Joe sometimes we think it's us children of God who brag about God who both about God but God also boast about us bird is delighted when he sees you a son or a daughter you'll take the word of God and you live by it God is on it in that and God boosted it's like a father when he sees his son growing up and he can see himself in his son obedient child respectful child hard-working 7 God the Pharisees is always on it in that child he is delighted when he was talking about his child you will see all the light bulbs come out but it is always different when that child is disobedient it's always different when that child is disrespectful it's always I mean when that child is something else sometimes the parents I even ashamed to talk of that child do not let God be ashamed to talk about you let God be proud to say this is my son this is my daughter bird busted about job one job didn't know anything about it and what did the devil say it's because you have blessed him so much you have blessed him you have blessed his household you have blessed family and not only that you have crossed a hedge around you you have cast a hedge around his family you have cast their hedge around his position everything he has you have cos hey since we are protected we are protected there is a world of fire that is burning our ona's by day and by night our lesser safe and secure in Christ Jesus the Bible says our less time hidden him in the Father there is no way the devil can get to us praise be to God the Bible says the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run it into it and is served thereby when you are living in the weight be rest assured that there is no way the devil can tamper with your life you know what there is fire in the word look I remember back home the dogs in America here are privileged dogs back home the dogs don't have it away when the weather is so cold you know where they sleep outside then we have something to call Hef I don't know it's just sometimes stone three stones one two three and then they put the fuel wood inside and then they use that to cook in the night their dog comes and then it's feeling so cold it's looking for a warm place to sleep it will just come close if it feels the heat it goes back when it comes so close it doesn't feel the heat it to use the hand and then scratch it a little it's only the stupid dog that would jump inside praise be to God and you'll know it you will hear shouted and claimed it did something stupid better Wise Ones do just do a make sure that there is no fire and then go inside and lie down so long as you are living in the world you are insulated by the way the Word of God is fire is light the devil can't get the word out of you the only way the devil can get you is to get you to disbelieve the word and you'll live the word then the devil can get ahold of you best so long as you keep believing so long as you keep holding on you are on the winning side praise be to God yes you have cast a hedge around him he except I can't get to him why don't you just put forth your hand and everything job has just take it away from him destroy it and see if he would not kiss you and go toward the devil that go everything he has is in your hands I mean you should be happy to know you should be glad to know that before your adversary that that even comes to you he has to go to your father as for permission and God knows what you can handle he knows what you are capable of he would make sure that you are not tempted beyond what you can bear the book of Corinthians says that and I see the devil go for a mullet a mullet it's a very big hammer very heavy you can lift it with one hand and I see the devil go with it go for it with a place I'm going to ask him what are you going with that him hey I'm going to finish me said no way you are not going with that go and take that whip and I see the devil complaining and sometimes situations happen and then we'll complain how God doesn't love us how God doesn't know us how we are so down and how nobody cares if gosh you open your eyes to see what the devil was coming to do and God stopped him even in the situation you are going to glorify God praise be to God the Bible has made it clear to us that he has the evil intention against us his thought for us at of peace willing above all things that we prosper even as our souls prosper and then the devil boss o in one day I can't just think of any human being on this earth that went through what job went through it was meant to be another day job was sitting down his severs had gone out all the animals the shape the Oz in the camels for review grazing the oxygens plowing just probably sitting down and just taking it easy and then his elder son was having a party and all the current way they're enjoying themselves and Joe was sitting down remember job was a man that loved God and men that hated sin he loved what God loved he hated what God hated and God was so honored in that man and he would even perform sacrifices because who says it maybe this room would when sinned against God and he will just go ahead and perform a sacrifice a bread offering on their behalf according to their number if anything happened so God would be merciful on them this was a righteous man and when Joe was sitting down one day here as one of his service oh we were in the fed plowing the Serbia's came and they killed every one of the servants and you have taken all the animals I'm the only one that has survived to come and tell the story as soon as he was finishing here comes a relevant Oh fire fell from heaven and has consumed order our orders sheep in the field before you go through here comes another sevens Oh the charges came and they have taken all the animals they have killed or the service I alone married to come and tell you and probably at this point he was thinking Oh anyway I have my children before he could even finish that here comes another servant Oh master all your children are dead not just one not just two all your children they were just having party in the elder brother's house a very strong wind came and just hit the four corners of the house who loved it an auditor and a dead Wow who is able to take this who is able to take this the Bible says he stood up here rent his mantle he shaved his say he fell down on his face and he did not kiss God he worshipped God He blessed God you know why brethren do not let your love for God hunt on the tails of this life do not let it be because bird has blessed you so much in certain areas of your life and because of that you are loving God the day those things are taken away your love for God will go away praise be to God love God because it is the right thing to do love but because you love God it doesn't matter what happens to your life I bet you even at the point of death you will not turn your back on God all that was taken away from him he worshiped God he said I came from a mother's womb and naked I would go he worshiped God blessed be the name of the Lord he did in case God wonderful it wasn't an easy task and he was probably now thinking hours way up day I am brought so low whereas life got for me now I love my 7 some say I get so close to you and they become your children they become like your brothers not only that loved his children I mean India Oh God and while he was thinking about this again the children of God got it and the devil appeared again you know the devil never gets tired the devil never gets tired back home we have an adage that if something is running after you if nothing that is trailing after you it's not complaining of tightness you that is running should not complain of tiredness praise be to God that did is chasing you and you know there is danger behind you you know there is death coming he is not tired and then you when Stannis who I am tired and there to catch up with you no way that is not your portion praise be to God the devil is never tired he is never tired coming to church why should you be it doesn't matter whether it's race or not he doesn't matter what race most or not I don't care what happens he will make sure he's in church and he is not even here to worship he's here to cause destruction and he is coming he is never tired why should you complain of tiredness why should you the second time that I will appear before the Lord he asked him again disturb persons what are you doing here they said I'm going to and fro up and down he said yes have you considered my servant job that indeed there is nobody like him he said yes you know what flesh for flesh a man would give everything he has for his life just take your hand this time just touch him touch his bones touch his passing and see if he will not kiss you in your face God said you are moving me against my servant you did it the first time you moved me against him say you know what Satan go his life is in your hands but you are not required to take his life away Satan has boundaries there is a battery he cannot cross hell when boss says the boundary he must obey God lead a boundary you are no cross in his boundary but go he went in this time full force and struck job with boils I mean just imagine when you have just one boil it gives you a headache it gives you sleepless night you had lots of appetite I just think about it job was struck with boils all over even the source of his feet he couldn't sit down he couldn't like that he couldn't stand what a terrible condition to find yourself you know what sometimes we find ourselves in conditions in storms that we have created ourselves because of our misbehavior because of our stupidity because of our foolishness because of certain wrong choices we have made in life we find ourselves in steady situation and you are suffering it and you know that oh I have caught for this and there are situations where you know that all know is it just my love for God your love for God you know your love for God and God's love for you is going to bring you into storms well you know the good thing about it when you get to that point and you examine your life if there is anything wrong make it right if you examine your life and there is nothing wrong and you know it was kinda sure you know what the love of God is taking your day that love of God will bring you out praise be to God do not be moved let your eyes be fixed on God stay put you know is it washes like this when you read further the Bible says his friends head of how job was suffering and said let us go and encourage him and when they saw him afar off they could they did not make him up and when the god day they stood they just heard they were looking at job ladies the Bible says seven days seven nights nobody split nobody open his mouth they couldn't just imagine it that a human being was going through whatever going wrong it's not easy in situations like this it's very very very important the people that are around you if they are badly if you surround yourself with godly people they give you girly advice they stand with you shoulder to shoulder and I pray with you out of that condition oh praise be to God and if that is not a situation this is where somebody will just come it is it I friend it has somebody and will tell you oh you know what this thing that is happening to you it is not it's not easy you know what I know one Baba I know I'm about some way praise be to God I had this thing god help those who help themselves don't sit down if you can't help yourself you don't need the help of God God help those who cannot help themselves and then before you away you are going to mallams you are going to Baba you are going to visit shrines you a child of God you are burn to places where you shouldn't go look if you have to start true to God and then by being faithful you know what serve God die and bow you know we are going to maan you there is no doubt about it Oman you it will break our hearts but it will gladden our house also to know that is just a matter of time and we shall see again if it will cause you to serve God faithfully and die do it and down we are weaker in this world to is the filthiest place you can ever think of the most dangerous place you can ever think of very nasty we are here just wear a wire we don't belong here this is not our home we are just passing through keep reminding yourself every day you wake up that this is not your home we have a better place to go to God wants the best for his children sometimes when we say God wants it the best for his children you're tinker's maybe living in a very good house in a mansion having in the best car having the best job good money no it is not that way God is interested in your soul that is how he's interested in even though he blesses us with a lot of physical things here and there but the main point is the salvation of your soul praise be to God and a second time in the condition that our Joe found himself in it was really terrible what was the devil trying to do the devil was trying to get Joe to kiss God and in spite of all these dopes did not kiss God he did not kiss God so much so that the devil dog got into jobs wife and his wife came to him and said where do you don't you kiss your bird and I curse him and die and even in that condition when he was down and out when he was so sleepless when he was suffering we just running down his cheeks he was thrown apart broke him he still looked in the face in into the face of his wife and told her don't speak like one of those foolish woman must we only accept good from God and not accept evil should we only accept good the goodness from God and not accept evil and guess what you may have thought that it was it was jobs wife that was speaking no it was the devil when the devil came before God he said do it and see if he will not kiss you because he couldn't get his wife to kiss I mean he couldn't get a job because God now he comes to his wife and then he was his wife comes why don't you kiss him there very well the devil used before God the devil is not a respecter of persons don't give yourself to the devil if you give yourself to the devil he will use you he will you see and abandon you if you give him a yacht he would take a man you open the door for him to come in he will take over the steering wheel resist him and he will flee praise be to God and the three friends when they finally broke their silence they told joke they started to accuse him started accusing him of some secret shame oh you know in moments like this in moments like this what brothers and sisters need is an encouragement as to let them know that you are standing with them now you are we done in the midst of the storm the last time brother where the chironex came here he says something that caught my attention he said when a storm comes as Tom who just come take one house right here and there is a house behind it it will leave the house right behind it and then just come and take a little house here and you wonder what is going on you know when the storms come the stores take away some houses they leave so and it's a good thing that some of the houses are left if you have seen some of those documentaries are those I mean as stop situations the first responders are always those on the ground whose houses were not touched before the paramedics come on the scene they are already out there with your flashlight when a year help help help they are they have they are they and when they go they are not holding the person and I kissed in the past yes you were a bad neighbor God don't punish you they are dead just try to encourage them stranding them or you'll be fine we have called ambulance is on the way you'll be fine praying with them encouraging them till there is health they don't go telling them oh you were very very bad neighbor so God is punishing you that's a good thing they don't do that so it's a good thing when you look at our setting when the storms even come in our setting the storms don't come to everybody the storm comes it makes a landfall here and there but then you realize that majority of us in the house don't have to deal with the storm directly so we are there as a resource for those that are affected by the storms it is not a time to sit down and they'll cross your feet and then just lie down and then enjoy life know when your brother or your sister is going through a storm invariably you are the one going through the stone there is a time to bear them up in prayer by their and by nights that we see the hand of God in their lives and we have seen that in this church time and again we have seen it that a devil that just doesn't come in and then touch one of us and then we sit back and look no we fight the devil we'll fight the devil we have seen that and we have seen the hand of God in this house praise be to God I know my redeemer liveth it was a very terrible condition Jobe was not going through what was going because he committed anything his love for God genuine love for God and God loved for him brought him this way now before job ever got here job was always asking himself a question I see that when you cut down the tree when it bees with smell water you will see the tree button on his side there is fresh life coming I see the grass they die and then as soon as the rain comes I see the grass growing back but a human being I see a man die I don't see anything about this man again what happens when a man leaves this earth it was a question that job kept asking himself and he wanted to know he was passionate about it what happens to a man when he dies does he get to live again does he ever get to live again and job was going to find the answer and he was so great together Elsa well life was good praise be to God when he had life going for him when his children way around him Oh daddy daddy daddy touching him on the here patting him lying on his lap that was such a time he was going to get the answer but at a point when he thought it was better he had not lived when he was down and out when he was in his lowest low I the darkest moment of his life when the ground under him are tapped in oh that was a time he was going to get that ass praise be to God and I want to read something from the prophet you know what he did talking about what God did he just raised up the kitchen a little bit and said job look yonder and what did you see what do you think he saw he saw Easter for his first time he saw the first Easter and he screamed I know my redeemer liveth sometimes when we talk about Easter some people think Easter is just a day in a calendar year that when that time comes you just go in your closet and you dig out your best clothes and then you come and you worship God that day you look for your Bible you probably have nothing for a year you come and yourself God that day um then after that day is over you go you throw your Bible somewhere you threw your coat somewhere and you are ready to go back into sin for another year and then you do all the dirty things and then you wait to this another year it's another Easter and then the world is celebrating the death of Christ and then you come again for us Easter is every day we commemorate the death of Christ every day we live because that is where our hope is without him coming to die for us just imagine what life would have been every day we get to live every day we live to see we are commemorating his death praise be to God for us Easter is every day and Joe for the first time for the first time in his life he is not getting to know what happens to a man when he dies oh what a blizzard place to be every man does chosen of God and every woman and child comes to that spot on those sacred suns to where God lists the kitchen and you see him in his resurrected power praise be to God you know that he lives and we as job can cry I know my redeemer liveth and idolize this he shall stand on the eighth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God yet in my body I shall see God that first view of Easter made a prophet scream he forgot of what he was going through he forgot a pain he forgot a loss he for but I mean oh it just took it just took took him took him from the lowest load to the highest high and God opened his eyes to see something he's been longing all his life to see and a tennis road and the legend is flush his sir Easter his first time when he did see it not when he had his well-groomed clothes on not when he had his hair combed perhaps today to their dads not when he was enjoying the very best of health but when he was in trouble when he was laying in trouble at the hour and almost of his death thus when he saw Easter thus where he saw the first resurrection oh it's been similar to you and I it's been when we laid at the altar some way until we were ready to die and said Lord God do something for me praise be to God it was then that God raised the curtain and with sin Easter with sin Easter not in a way of theology so much we never seen Easter as wearing new clothes we never seen it as little rabbits and colored eggs we seen Easter in the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ praise be to God that was the real Easter and when he screamed God and the back praise be to God oh what a wonderful time to be a Christian you should just rejoice that you are a Christian whether you have the essential things of life or not rejoice in who you are when I started I was talking about the pawn shop experience and I said hold fast to that I'll be coming back to it and I want to come back to it the Bible says that is sin did my mother conceive me and in iniquity was i shipping come to the world speaking life you didn't have to come into this world to do something evil to become a sinner you were already burned away who were born sinners and every one of us once upon a time we were seated in the devil's pawn shop the devil chained us put us on his shelves we had no way out that devil had us praise be to God they remember as I was talking about the posture of experience even though the devil heard us in his pawn shop the devil had no authority over our life he was just keeping out for a short while our Redeemer was coming and things were going to change praise be to God and a ransom has been paid on that day on the cross of Calvary when his blood was shed for us and when he cried out with a loud voice and he said it is finished it was indeed finish praise be to God the ransom was paid the price was paid he paid with his own life with his royal blood with his precious blood yes you have no business in being in the devil's pawn shop anymore you don't belong there for the chains are broken the corsa cut asunder you are free to demonstrate your power and authority in the kingdom of God you don't belong to the devil there were has no authority of law like over a life you are a child of God you'll be looked at to the kingdom of God you know there was a story about about this this cow that was tied under a tree for so long and then around it their way their way their way there was grass very fresh green grass and this this cow was dying of hunger and there was this man that was passing and he looked at this cow the cow was starving to death he said no I have to do something about this he went in on Titus cow taking this cow will just go and start grazing but a car wouldn't move why because it's been tied up for so long that is some of our problems then a double headers for so long in his pawn shop now even though we are free to work out we are so certain day I am here just wanted to tell you that you have no business building a devil's pawn shop get out you don't belong there praise be to God I know sometimes that double himself is even surprised what you are doing in the pawn shop it looks at you say what is this guy doing here he doesn't know he is free to go the price the price is paid and he is sitting here is this guy okay and sometimes maybe he comes and then I and then you jump a little and you sit back get out you have no business with the devil the devil has no business in your life you are a child of God fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of God and you are here to serve the purpose of God praise be to God praise God they take us that is our this word ever seen was Good Friday when all hopes all was written and all hopes they had was that was written on paper all the hopes they had was what some philosopher had said and there was a prince of life dying at Calvary it was the darkest hour the world ever seen but Easter produced the brightest hour that the world ever seen praise be to God when he was dying it was the darkest hour the world ever saw but when he rose that morning the world saw the brightest day it ever saw praise be to God our Redeemer liveth he has redeemed us unto himself we are not an accident in the kingdom of God we belong to him before there was ever a world and he is here to redeem us and he has redeemed us are doing himself that we should fear no more the we shall rejoice and what he has done for us for the price is paid our Redeemer liveth praise be to God I have a few more I married Emily Vava to disappear seven eight and nine but you know what I won't skip page eight I don't know why I was keeping it let me go to page nine now come the joy and the hope of the ages a resurrection for all believers for we will share with him in his resurrection we have shared with him in his suffering you know it's sad that we don't want to share with him in his suffering but we want to share with him in his resurrection better child of God we are called to share with him in his suffering and in his resurrection that is the way it ought to be for we share with him in his resurrection as we have as we have shared with him in his suffering he that suffice with me shall reign with me oh then must I be carried home to heaven on the flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the price and sailed through bloody seas no I must fight if I must reign increase my courage Lord that should be our prayer I must fight if I must win increase my courage Lord there is there are no cowards in the kingdom of God praise be to God we are warriors we are called to be on the battlefield and you ought to be on the forefront and we fight and go forward we don't fight and retreat praise be to God increase my courage Lord does should be our prayer oh I must not go as a coward I must not go around daily with my head hanging down as if something was terrible when I look at the world in all their darkness and all the occurring on I must raise my head walk with my head among the Eagles knowing this that I know him in the power of his resurrection because he lives we live also because he raised from the dead I shall raise also he shall raise again you shall rise again that's what is the means to a believer a chaplain one is the morning he was going down the road he was going down through the tents where the wounded and the dying was laying a Red Cross nests come along the boys had been on the front for a long out day for so long all day they are just not so weary and what have you and so she that is the Red Cross national so she had a bunch of roses in her hand and as she passed by each little cut where the boys was laying crying it was Easter was Easter for them please were going over bumps dropping she had take a rose and give each to a boy and then say God bless you as she has the Rose over she says god bless you god bless you brother those soldiers would grip that rose and scream for the knew that Rose was grown in a land where they belonged praise be to God brother this morning we are in a world of dangerous poisonous gas we are in a world where all kinds of doctrine and stuff that says there's no resurrection and there is no divine healing there's no death there note that or the order but not the Red Cross Ness better Holy Ghost comes along once in a while and brings us over on those secret signs of God's grace and pours into our house a little token from the land beyond the river praise be to God and when we get there we know we have that feeling oh the yes this feeling is not of this world it's reminding us of home we'll look and then we can see by eyes of faith that this is just something God is just doing reminding us of our home reminding that it is type is home going time reminding that this is not our place we don't belong here not the Red Cross Ness praise be to God my redeemer lives my redeemer kinda musicians come over I know that my Redeemer liveth not I think not I think have a true experience with God

there but you know what you are anchored in the word you are not going to be moved but if you are not anchored in the Word of God and a little storm that comes will just take you away praise be to God
