[40:10] hallelujah
[40:11] you know Burroughs was preaching on
[40:13] Sunday and he was talking a little bit
[40:15] there on creation and then he was
[40:17] talking about he make mention about a
[40:21] big The Big Bang Theory and then he
[40:23] mentioned brother Branham on Bourbon MCS
[40:25] you know when one of those times went
[40:27] out in the beginning and and and God
[40:30] says stopped and a stopped right there
[40:33] and why he was saying that in my mind I
[40:35] was saying when it's when when the start
[40:38] stop or the planet or whatever it was
[40:41] that came out when it stopped right
[40:43] there it might have made a sound maybe
[40:46] that was the sound that Einstein heard
[40:48] and called it a Big Bang it surely make
[40:50] a bang amen praise the Lord but we want
[40:54] to also remind you we spoke about
[40:58] finding the dead to visit with sister
[41:01] Jackie I think the last time she came
[41:04] many of her folks were very concerned
[41:06] you know what kind of a church in
[41:08] Minneapolis that would send a driver to
[41:11] come and pick you up and drive you to
[41:13] Minneapolis and bring you back you know
[41:16] I don't know what other thing we are
[41:18] aliens we are human beings say man we
[41:20] just love the Lord and we love the
[41:22] people that love the Lord so she sent us
[41:25] she sent a report that you know there
[41:27] are some loved ones I want to see these
[41:29] kind of a people and so I think is the
[41:33] second of November there should be the
[41:35] first Saturday and for a few of us that
[41:39] can be able to make it we will confirm
[41:42] the date again on Sunday as we try to
[41:45] talk to her in a week and we've been
[41:48] sending our most of our communication
[41:50] through system now I mean she's been
[41:52] happiness and so we will confirm that
[41:55] but we just want to get down there you
[41:57] know and just and just support our
[41:59] sister you know you know she's she loved
[42:04] the Lord and in the age where she is and
[42:09] you know and she been going to you know
[42:14] a Baptist Church to everybody know her
[42:17] in in the little town and Jackie that
[42:19] just have the call her amen the elderly
[42:22] woman that refused to wear paints you
[42:25] know then she having social repetition
[42:27] amen amen so we just want to get out
[42:33] there you know the little weekend and
[42:35] and last Wednesday brother Lord share
[42:37] his testimony of meeting those people
[42:40] you know and and then right after that
[42:43] Thursday brother Wesley called me you
[42:47] know one of the eye appliances went down
[42:50] in the house I guess the dish wash or
[42:51] something like that and they brought
[42:53] someone to come in and we you know help
[42:56] them repair it and it turned out the
[42:58] same experience but Aloha they had the
[43:01] same experience you know talking about
[43:03] the Lord and these people have had you
[43:06] know miracles and different things you
[43:08] know so it was it was such a blessing
[43:10] now in my mind what I'm thinking about
[43:13] is there there's there's just a feeling
[43:18] in the air you know that's what I'm
[43:21] thinking in my mind you know something
[43:23] is happening I don't know what it is you
[43:26] know I'm not going to port on
[43:27] interpretation to it but I
[43:29] just believe that in this in this Glenny
[43:33] time you know because the harvest is
[43:35] over we are in the Glenny time in this
[43:38] cleaning time there is one more seed
[43:41] that can be pick up from somewhere Amen

[44:00] where the surprise would be you know it
[44:03] could be up the hill it could be down
[44:05] here it could be on the side way but the
[44:07] thing about it is that when she was
[44:09] leaving the house she knew that she will
[44:11] not come back with empty hand amen

[44:16] and that is the faith we want to hold in
[44:19] this hour praise the Lord

[44:22] campaigns healing campaigns and and we
[44:25] don't we don't doubt that God can net he

[49:25] minutes that is before us bless us in
[49:27] your presence in Jesus name Amen
[49:30] Allah bless you you may have you see
[49:34] praise the Lord
[49:40] years ago I remember one of the time I
[49:45] might have preached it when I was a you
[49:50] know pastor in our little group there in
[49:52] the Ivory Coast but I remember one time
[49:54] I was over in Algeria and then you know
[49:58] I was taking a couple of services but
[50:01] then I used someone 18 verse 8 and and
[50:06] I've always believed with lot of the
[50:09] research that I did that that was the
[50:11] center verse of the Bible but recently I
[50:14] went back to check on it again and I've
[50:17] seen a lot of different information that
[50:20] that is not the center of verse of the
[50:21] Bible but I'm not going to go into into
[50:26] argument and research and all that but
[50:29] why we said tonight is that that mind
[50:31] central verse of the Bible amen
[50:33] praise the Lord it is my central verse
[50:36] of the Bible so let's just read that
[50:38] there's some 118 some one one eight
[50:49] you know I had all of this thing I just
[50:51] wrote it down one that I was going to
[50:54] preach you know and I just said what
[50:57] I've just found something to speak to
[51:00] the people on and I was just trying to
[51:03] use that as a saint a thing but that's
[51:07] that's what I want to just read tonight
[51:10] like I did like Davis said the sam says
[51:13] here it is better to trust in the Lord
[51:15] than to put confidence in Princes praise
[51:21] the Lord amen
[51:23] I don't know about you but that's how I
[51:29] feel I feel I was talking to brother
[51:35] Ezekiel had time to spend with him as we
[51:38] drive you know we had a good fellowship
[51:41] we really had a good time together and
[51:45] so as we will go in a lawn I told me I
[51:47] said Tony my sis I said brother I want
[51:49] you to pray for me to have a prayer
[51:50] request you know I just feeling in my
[51:54] heart that I need to trust the Lord
[51:58] praise Lord amen so like I said tonight
[52:02] if you if you want to get there with me
[52:04] let's get there together praise the Lord
[52:06] but let's let's preciate a little bit I
[52:09] mean and and broadband and precious
[52:12] message laying there unto your own
[52:15] understanding and and there are a few
[52:25] things that he spoke about thee I want
[52:28] to go back a little bit but why why I
[52:32] took that message as as as as an
[52:37] inspiration to bring this thing out to
[52:39] us tonight is because as I was as I was
[52:44] studying I realized that there is a
[52:47] there is a Hebrew word there for trust
[52:51] that also means to lean amen
[52:59] it means to lean so then I told on a
[53:03] tour analysis world here Solomon year
[53:06] saying you know trust in the Lord with
[53:09] all your heart don't trust your own
[53:13] understanding amen praise the Lord now
[53:21] washing now he didn't I said don't trust
[53:26] your understanding he said don't trust
[53:28] your own understanding praise the Lord
[53:35] because there are a lot of things we
[53:38] understand by revelation we understand
[53:42] and by experience praise the Lord
[53:47] but when it comes to a being our all
[53:51] understanding then is when we are trying
[53:54] to interpret the situation I think
[54:00] that's what Solomon was warning us
[54:03] against amen let's wait let God
[54:09] interpret the situation remember we were
[54:12] talking about the three things that we
[54:14] must not do we must not you know
[54:19] misinterpret the word we must not
[54:22] misinterpret what God is doing in our
[54:26] lives around our lives let's just wait
[54:28] this vision we speak for itself
[54:33] praise the Lord God has bear with us
[54:36] let's bear with him a little bit
[54:39] are we together now so there are some
[54:42] few things that that brother Branham
[54:46] said in in introduction of this message
[54:50] and I want to I want to use their
[54:53] tonight I never even Acts if if if I
[54:59] were not go back to you a little bit but
[55:02] I sure we did so Lynette unto thine own
[55:09] understanding
[55:11] he said here written by Solomon one of
[55:15] the wisest man in the world outside of
[55:20] our Lord Jesus but he wasn't exactly
[55:24] like Solomon and so much that Solomon
[55:29] was a man born of a woman praise the
[55:34] Lord
[55:34] and was begotten by an earthly father
[55:38] David but Jesus was a virgin born son
[55:41] and was not altogether a man but he was
[55:46] God he was the god man and he was more
[55:54] than a man he he was a man plus E but
[55:58] Solomon was just a man like you and I
[56:02] and he asked God for wisdom now this is
[56:06] the thing that kind of a struck me and I
[56:07] was trade a little bit here but let's
[56:09] just let just stay together and I will
[56:12] leave this and then I will go back to
[56:15] crisis the mystery of God revealed
[56:16] because this thing hit me and what it is
[56:19] is their brother Brennan said in crisis
[56:22] the mystery of God revealed a scroll was
[56:25] bringing out his great mystery he wrote
[56:28] some in the heavens amen
[56:30] he wrote some in times in shadow and he
[56:34] also wrote some in the lives of the
[56:37] prophets their very lives of the
[56:43] prophets amen
[56:46] they were living their lives but yet
[56:50] they were clearing a mystery now as I
[56:55] thought about that I thought in my mind
[56:59] what mystery was Solomon carrying
[57:02] because we know that Solomon is a
[57:04] mystery look at his birth amen and and
[57:12] according to Scripture Solomon was not
[57:14] the favorite oh yeah let's look at some
[57:18] scriptures here tonight praise the Lord
[57:21] 2nd Kings chapter 13
[57:26] are we together settle came chapter 13
[57:34] praise the Lord in any and you and you
[57:43] know with all the disgrace that's the
[57:47] absolute broad on David David still not
[57:52] that boy if you look at it naturally
[57:56] naturally with the way that David has
[58:00] Solomon his heart whenever to Solomon to
[58:04] sit on his throne summer birth was a
[58:07] disgrace to David in every way
[58:11] yes Solomon himself was innocent
[58:15] amen praise the Lord does that not
[58:18] happen sometimes with some parents they
[58:21] go through some things and have a child
[58:23] and at the time they are going through
[58:26] their struggle or that difficulty and
[58:29] this child is coming along and at some
[58:32] times after they have the tribe this
[58:36] starts to hit the child because they
[58:38] suffer during having the child o when we
[58:42] are we were having this child I mean we
[58:44] never have so no food to eat I mean it's
[58:47] almost like the child brought bad luck
[58:50] when the child is innocent
[58:54] praise Allah the child is innocent so if
[59:02] you just look at you just just look at
[59:04] it a little bit you realize that if God
[59:07] only have spoken to David it would have
[59:10] never been David choice praise the Lord
[59:16] when job I killed Absalom
[59:21] David was greedy Davey was angry this is
[59:29] the son Absalom that kick him off the
[59:32] throne this is the very son
[59:37] was not in mind in our salon he got I
[59:41] thought fair he was he were gathering
[59:43] David counselor
[59:45] he was grabbing all the men they knew
[59:48] how to get David because he knew if he
[59:52] could get Debbie he will reign now let's
[59:56] go here a little bit second Kings
[59:58] chapter 13 it's not what I said okay I
[1:00:02] have to find out whether that's what I
[1:00:04] mean
[1:00:05] I mean I said a lot of things I don't
[1:00:09] mean it and you have been gracious to
[1:00:12] bear with me Amen praise the Lord amen
[1:00:21] second Kings chapter tithing
[1:00:24] let's read verse 37 a little bit here
[1:00:26] and Absalom fled and went to to Telma
[1:00:33] the son of a mean whole king of Joseph
[1:00:38] and Devi mourn for his son
[1:00:43] everything praise the Lord
[1:00:51] what did I say
[1:00:55] I said second king oh praise the Lord it
[1:01:01] was good that I confess I mean second
[1:01:04] Samuel Amy I mean second Samuel I told
[1:01:08] you I always say things I don't mean it
[1:01:13] second Samuel amen
[1:01:20] second Samuel 13 verse 37 it speaks here
[1:01:29] of how David mourn for his son
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:42] are you in second Samuel okay
[1:01:46] this speaks of how David moon for his
[1:01:48] son let's go to chapter 15 chapter 15
[1:01:56] verse 6 they that's a second Samia I
[1:01:59] mean second Samuel okay
[1:02:03] praise the Lord verse 6 he said and and
[1:02:09] all the manner did Absalom and on this
[1:02:15] manner did Absalom to all Israel that
[1:02:21] came to the king for judgment
[1:02:24] so Absalon stole the heart of the men of
[1:02:29] Israel I mean
[1:02:33] Absalon stole the heart of the men of
[1:02:36] Israel then I was kind of checking in
[1:02:38] because I this was just right on my mind
[1:02:40] before I came out of the office and so I
[1:02:42] started looking because there's a place
[1:02:44] where the Bible speaks of the heart of
[1:02:46] the people being after Absalom
[1:02:48] I mean he won the heart of the people
[1:02:51] praise the Lord
[1:02:53] and it was it was just for the very fact
[1:02:56] that there was a big question mark on
[1:03:00] the birth of Solomon praise the Lord
[1:03:07] are we together verse 13 of the same
[1:03:12] chapter 15 verse 13 and there came a
[1:03:17] messenger to David saying the heart of
[1:03:19] the men of Israel after Absalom this is
[1:03:26] net this is net before a Solomon it was
[1:03:32] right there from from from you know from
[1:03:35] the beginning the Lord has already
[1:03:36] started dealing with David and letting
[1:03:38] even know that you know Solomon will be
[1:03:42] the one that would that will build him a
[1:03:43] house and you know in all of this the
[1:03:45] law started dealing with with David
[1:03:47] already praise the Lord
[1:03:50] but you see here is a conflict now I
[1:03:53] want to see this conflict in the life of
[1:03:56] David
[1:03:56] and if you can see it with me tonight
[1:03:59] here is David there he loved his boys
[1:04:02] Absalon if I were even speaks all the
[1:04:07] appearance of Absalom he was this boy
[1:04:11] with with with a big afro amen because
[1:04:17] his hair got caught in the tree he was a
[1:04:20] ham song God his very appearance was
[1:04:23] appealing praise the Lord
[1:04:27] now you have to realize there David
[1:04:30] birth I mean
[1:04:32] Solomon birth was a mistake amen and by
[1:04:39] the order of the children arsalan was
[1:04:43] there before Solomon are we together so
[1:04:47] you can reseed they're all alone as
[1:04:50] David was traveling in his journey his
[1:04:53] mind was on absolute his heart was on
[1:04:56] Absalom
[1:04:57] this is a this is a man that can be able
[1:05:00] to command that split the army off of
[1:05:04] his father he has some leadership
[1:05:07] ability in him I mean you mean if he
[1:05:12] could appeal to the heart of the men of
[1:05:14] Israel there was something in this boy
[1:05:19] maybe that was what David saw in his and
[1:05:24] he loved actually I mean he grieved he
[1:05:27] grieved agreed on tell draw up how to go
[1:05:31] and take an old woman to come and win
[1:05:35] the heart of David she disguised herself
[1:05:38] and she came and she started crying -
[1:05:41] David all kings saved my son King saved
[1:05:45] my son she should just bill all the
[1:05:47] story until she was able to draw David
[1:05:50] out of mourning with a concern for her
[1:05:54] son when didn't realize that he was
[1:05:57] caught in a trap he said to me Joe up
[1:06:00] for you to do this
[1:06:06] are we together tonight but what am I
[1:06:09] trying to bring here is that there was
[1:06:12] something the entire birth of Solomon
[1:06:15] was holding a mystery some of those
[1:06:19] mystery that was written in the lives of
[1:06:22] the prophets that would benefit you and
[1:06:26] myself I mean some of God's children
[1:06:32] will now be born in holy wedlock some of
[1:06:35] God's children God predestinated seed
[1:06:38] will be I just I was just listening to
[1:06:41] so a brother that was talking telling
[1:06:45] the testimony and you know let me go
[1:06:49] ahead at because my mind is trying to
[1:06:52] run into that but what am I trying to
[1:06:54] say that is that there will be there
[1:06:56] will be a lot of situation around God's
[1:06:59] people life and as the Old Testament
[1:07:03] it's a shadow the types and shadows are
[1:07:07] there the lives of the prophets and the
[1:07:10] different people that God used God will
[1:07:13] put something in their life to be able
[1:07:18] to show and one of the things that was
[1:07:20] aimed Solomon life was the hidden wisdom
[1:07:25] of God and that was the reason why when
[1:07:29] Solomon asked God for wisdom it pleased
[1:07:32] him because that was the thing that was
[1:07:35] hidden in his life the hidden wisdom of
[1:07:40] God you might not find it in the Bible
[1:07:45] maybe the Prophet said nothing about it
[1:07:48] but God had a Haiti wisdom praise the
[1:07:55] Lord
[1:07:57] you know every good teacher there is a
[1:08:01] little piece that they don't give out
[1:08:05] amen they can teach this they can teach
[1:08:09] this they can teach this but they would
[1:08:12] keep a little piece a little recipe just
[1:08:16] to be able to show that they are
[1:08:18] and God has a hidden wisdom amen when we
[1:08:25] think that we have come to know all
[1:08:27] there is there's something yet that we
[1:08:31] don't know there is there's something
[1:08:38] here that we don't know and that's what
[1:08:42] God hid in the life of Solomon hidden
[1:08:49] wisdom praise the Lord
[1:08:55] his his wisdom that confound the wise
[1:09:01] his wisdom that were pulled all the the
[1:09:06] Pharisee describes the man knows the
[1:09:08] Lord rather the Lord of Moses backside
[1:09:11] and they be ready I'm sat down but when
[1:09:13] they stand before Solomon becoming a
[1:09:17] king how can we reconcile that with the
[1:09:20] Lord how can we reconcile that with the
[1:09:25] Lord of Moses praise the Lord
[1:09:30] God never only told David God back it up
[1:09:35] he never only told David he back it up
[1:09:39] even at the dedication of the temple a
[1:09:42] I've never been it was not in the
[1:09:43] tabernacle of Moses God came down the
[1:09:46] people who see it they could read it it
[1:09:50] was in a class it was visible
[1:09:56] everybody can hit a man but when God is
[1:10:00] with that man
[1:10:01] God will back him up God will always
[1:10:06] back his children all we're always back
[1:10:12] the things that he himself has designed
[1:10:16] in our lives
[1:10:20] praise the Lord
[1:10:22] God will allow David to go into one of
[1:10:27] the the the I mean the most shameful
[1:10:30] part of his life just to use their to be
[1:10:36] able to bring out his hidden wisdom
[1:10:42] praise the Lord
[1:10:43] how I could miss me somebody would mean
[1:10:48] tonight praise the Lord we can just stop
[1:10:53] right here and just think about their
[1:10:55] all night long that God will allow you
[1:11:01] to go in some of the most shameful
[1:11:04] behavior just to show he's hating wisdom
[1:11:08] to you praise the Lord
[1:11:17] what Branham say a year in crisis the
[1:11:20] minister of God revealed I realized I'm
[1:11:24] dealing with time year
[1:11:32] I would together man he said this he I
[1:11:38] mean he talks about the the life of the
[1:11:41] prophets he says here he said yeah he
[1:11:45] says all those things tied him but yet
[1:11:54] the mistress the mystery was here there
[1:11:58] men didn't know what they were doing
[1:12:01] they only knew that they were led by the
[1:12:06] spirit to do something now hold it back
[1:12:12] in the in in the last day for the great
[1:12:16] revelation which means God held back the
[1:12:19] understanding of their very life their
[1:12:23] wish of course which mean we understand
[1:12:26] their lives better than they did
[1:12:37] are we together now and and this is the
[1:12:45] man Solomon he could feed it and Solomon
[1:12:52] was making what honor his brother tried
[1:12:54] to do he tried to talk to Bell Sheba
[1:12:57] because she was a stranger she was a
[1:13:01] stranger look at her birth line she was
[1:13:04] not a daughter of Israel she was a
[1:13:06] stranger she was a Gentile woman so you
[1:13:11] can just you think about the complex
[1:13:14] that was around that is the reason why
[1:13:18] when I saw my brother came to him and
[1:13:20] was making a request he went to he went
[1:13:23] to the mother because what she knows her
[1:13:28] life story everybody talked about her
[1:13:31] she want to gain some favor she went to
[1:13:33] Solomon okay can't you please do this
[1:13:35] for your brother Solomon had to stand as
[1:13:40] a man and say mama you wait you wait I
[1:13:46] know you you are everybody mother but
[1:13:48] right now I'm the king I'm the one have
[1:13:52] to run decision yeah but all of those
[1:13:56] things is because of some of the complex
[1:14:00] the life present us but when a man has
[1:14:05] found when he has fine himself in the
[1:14:10] plan of God when he have high grades to
[1:14:14] understand that God has brought him
[1:14:18] through what he were brought through for
[1:14:20] a reason
[1:14:21] amen you can never take stand for God's
[1:14:26] Word until you understand what God is
[1:14:30] doing
[1:14:32] if you shall paralyze Joshua verbatim
[1:14:35] says you can never have faith in a
[1:14:38] situation I'll tell you honesty
[1:14:45] praise the Lord so you just think about
[1:14:48] it the complex situation I live present
[1:14:51] him in the things that he have to deal
[1:14:53] with and everybody talking about his
[1:14:55] mother everybody they're getting us on
[1:14:59] story about his birthing and you know I
[1:15:01] mean she they went down she pressed her
[1:15:04] to her said they said that about her
[1:15:05] that since there's about and said it's
[1:15:07] about how and yeah this is the man they
[1:15:09] have to be sitting on the throne no
[1:15:11] wonder I'm so uncle Wayne an easy
[1:15:14] campaign he could just use all of my
[1:15:18] birth and run around the town and win
[1:15:20] the hearts of the people can't you see
[1:15:23] can't you see this is injustice can't
[1:15:29] you see I've been in the house go back
[1:15:32] to the prodigal son go back to the
[1:15:35] prodigal son I'm the senior brother I've
[1:15:37] been in the house before this one was
[1:15:39] born out of a dart tray to come here and
[1:15:41] become king can't you see how he could
[1:15:45] win the House of the People
[1:15:50] praise the Lord in time like that when
[1:15:58] you don't have nothing enough that we
[1:16:01] appear to people mind to win your case
[1:16:04] you need to trust them and you need to
[1:16:12] trust the Lord let's get into trust in
[1:16:14] the Lord and you understand what it is
[1:16:16] praise the Lord we trust the law because
[1:16:22] most of the time it's because but when
[1:16:26] it comes to trusting God there is no
[1:16:28] because trusting God does not have a
[1:16:31] handle on the cop amen there is nothing
[1:16:38] that come as a handle for you to trust
[1:16:41] God you have to trust him not through
[1:16:43] anything
[1:16:51] Priscilla yeah that's the man I wrote
[1:16:56] this brother branham said we get back to
[1:16:59] death written by Solomon one of the
[1:17:00] wisest man in the world in the word but
[1:17:03] Jesus was a virgin birth he when we went
[1:17:05] through there he says but Solomon was
[1:17:08] just a man like you and I and he asked
[1:17:10] God for wisdom that was where he brought
[1:17:13] the China that was were he pleased God
[1:17:18] because the very thing that that was on
[1:17:22] God concerning his life he broke the
[1:17:27] China he broke the China
[1:17:35] there is one word for every one of us
[1:17:43] praise the Lord in seven God
[1:17:50] Christianity I support a lot of things
[1:17:55] before us and it just lost like it's all
[1:17:58] down to the rules and the regulation and
[1:18:01] the laws and the commandment in the
[1:18:03] church order and the doctrines all of
[1:18:07] those things it's just for us here the
[1:18:10] Heavenly Father don't look at that what
[1:18:13] he looks at is what he has highlighted
[1:18:17] under your name what he has ordained for
[1:18:23] you that he have highlighted and that's
[1:18:26] when you missed him it's when you miss
[1:18:29] that then you have missed the mark for
[1:18:31] the Lord that's the missing of the mark
[1:18:34] that mark was not a Mack of a man it's
[1:18:38] not a Mack of our parents it's not a
[1:18:43] Mack of the church it's God's mark for
[1:18:46] your life and when a man we can hit that
[1:18:52] the sky is your limit for and rise
[1:18:58] God is just pleased and happy with you
[1:19:08] that's the thing that we're supposed to
[1:19:11] be looking for that is the reason why we
[1:19:16] pray that's the reason why we consecrate
[1:19:18] our live because being finit being we
[1:19:20] don't understand those things we don't
[1:19:23] know Amen we don't know the full purpose
[1:19:27] of God for our life we don't know that
[1:19:30] one thing that God want us to do every
[1:19:33] man have a job
[1:19:37] praise the Lord
[1:19:41] what that won't think
[1:19:55] let's Oliver went down there and he's
[1:19:58] praying just went down there to the
[1:20:00] chopper and near down he's praying Oh
[1:20:02] God
[1:20:03] lord help being father your people are
[1:20:07] such a great people their greatness is
[1:20:12] not because of the multitude that
[1:20:15] greatness is because you are seen in
[1:20:17] your people and you cherish your people
[1:20:20] your people are the very strain of your
[1:20:24] heart now even if they're very
[1:20:28] rebellious people when Moses would tell
[1:20:31] them that they are rebellious you kick
[1:20:33] him from seeing the promised land
[1:20:36] he honors to how God's people were very
[1:20:40] precious to God's heart how can I leave
[1:20:48] social people the people that you have
[1:20:51] written your ways in their life that's
[1:20:55] what we don't understand about the
[1:20:56] people of God God ways are written in
[1:21:00] their life praise the Lord so most
[1:21:13] social people social people after
[1:21:18] reeling reading all Moses testimony
[1:21:22] praise the Lord
[1:21:24] why they were gossiping about Solomon he
[1:21:26] was spending time to read he was
[1:21:29] spending time in the word praise the
[1:21:34] Lord Amen those are those are the kind
[1:21:40] of a situation where when the pressure
[1:21:42] comes on and woman just take her child
[1:21:45] and run out of the run out of the place
[1:21:48] because what will you do to ever please
[1:21:51] the people you not be a daughter you're
[1:21:55] not born in the ceiling but then you
[1:21:56] don't speak the same what will you do to
[1:21:58] ever please them the hidden wisdom
[1:22:07] god
[1:22:12] Priscilla now you see when you read a
[1:22:16] book of Solomon and eat ecclesiastic
[1:22:21] then you understand
[1:22:23] praise the Lord then you understand that
[1:22:28] God hate wisdom in Solomon life he never
[1:22:34] had nothing to do with his ten thousand
[1:22:36] why we never have nothing to do with his
[1:22:38] heart being stolen that was just a flesh
[1:22:41] but God propose remember that God's
[1:22:46] purpose is never defeated praise the
[1:22:51] Lord and God's purpose in your life will
[1:22:56] never be defeated
[1:23:00] that's the God that we serve
[1:23:05] he has spread out his ways in the life
[1:23:10] of his people about Jesus consist except
[1:23:14] you become like a little child never
[1:23:16] enter the kingdom of heaven you stop a
[1:23:19] little bit except a man be born again
[1:23:21] Nicodemus says do I go back in my mother
[1:23:24] womb God has just distributorship I said
[1:23:28] that last Wednesday and I'm just praying
[1:23:31] him and asking the Lord to help me Dona
[1:23:34] study on that a little bit but there is
[1:23:37] just something about creation that is
[1:23:40] just that is just if you can be able to
[1:23:45] see it if you can be able to grab it man
[1:23:49] is beautiful it's beautiful
[1:23:52] God is he's just he spray himself out in
[1:23:56] his creation you remember the old man on
[1:23:59] the sea brother Branham says the ball
[1:24:01] when I asked his Sunday school teacher
[1:24:02] where is God he said are you crazy
[1:24:04] young boy we're going to be questioning
[1:24:07] you asking you know even ask about what
[1:24:09] it means to be born again or but what
[1:24:11] kind of baptism you asking where is God
[1:24:15] but when he went to the old man on the
[1:24:18] sea he said son I spend most of my life
[1:24:23] on the sea and all that I see
[1:24:26] is going because God spray himself out
[1:24:30] in the universe when God reveal himself
[1:24:35] Genesis chapter one in the beginning
[1:24:37] what did the scripture says God created
[1:24:40] he Revere himself as the Creator as the
[1:24:49] Creator
[1:24:51] Polybius for you tonight while we pray
[1:24:54] and go home
[1:24:54] he Revere himself as their creator one
[1:25:03] of the easier way to be able to deal
[1:25:05] with your situation look for the Creator
[1:25:08] because creator creation is an ongoing
[1:25:11] work it's an ongoing work every day God
[1:25:17] is creating every day there's a creation
[1:25:22] that is growing on you see the doctors
[1:25:24] in the hospital they are doing a hip
[1:25:27] surgery creation the mother bringing
[1:25:32] babies creation praise the Lord

[1:32:22] him he will walk on the line and balance
[1:32:25] himself and the people would cheer him
[1:32:27] out and he told them I can ride a
[1:32:30] wheelbarrow over this line and the
[1:32:34] people believed him
[1:32:35] but when it came to a time where he asks
[1:32:39] if there is anyone that want to sit in a
[1:32:41] wheelbarrow for him to go across there
[1:32:45] was no one that could trust him with
[1:32:48] your life a father sometimes does it is
[1:32:51] law we want to we try to look how you

[1:35:48] loved one to be saved we trust the Lord
[1:35:52] four different ones and we trust the law
[1:35:54] for healing but if you don't trust
[1:35:57] yourself to the law pretty soon what you
[1:36:02] are trusting a law for is going to fail
[1:36:04] out because if he don't have you if you
[1:36:08] have not fully committed yourself
