[58:05] of course is a very familiar scripture I
[58:07] didn't send my quotes back there Jordan
[58:08] I apologize I just
[58:10] didn't get time
[58:13] very familiar scripture to us all now
[58:15] the Lord had said unto Abram get thee
[58:18] out of thy country and from thy Kindred
[58:20] and from thy Father's House unto a land
[58:23] that I will show thee and I will make of
[58:25] the great nation and I will bless thee
[58:28] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[58:30] be a blessing and I will bless them that
[58:33] bless thee and curse him that curse thee
[58:35] and in thee shall all families of the
[58:38] earth be blessed so Abram departed as
[58:41] the Lord had spoken unto him and lot
[58:43] went with him and Abram was 75 years old
[58:47] when he departed out of Heron uh you may
[58:50] be seated we're going to keep reading
[58:51] down a little bit here
[58:54] and Abram took sarai's wife and lot his
[58:57] brother's son and all their substance
[58:59] that they had gathered and the souls
[59:01] that they had gotten in uh Heron and
[59:04] they went forth to go into the land of
[59:07] Canaan and into the land of Canaan they
[59:09] came
[59:10] and we'll just kind of skip down a
[59:12] little bit
[59:15] and Abram verse 9 and Abram's Journey
[59:17] going on still toward the South
[59:20] and there was a famine in the land and
[59:23] Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn
[59:25] there for the famine was Grievous in the
[59:29] land
[59:29] and then let's just read from uh in a
[59:31] class Ecclesiastes 3
[59:34] just a couple of verses here as well
[59:37] it's everything there is a season and a
[59:40] time to every purpose under the heaven
[59:43] a time to be born and a time to die
[59:46] a time to plant and a time to pluck up
[59:49] that which is planted
[59:50] A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time
[59:53] to break down and a time to build up
[59:56] a time to weep and a time to laugh
[59:59] a time to mourn and a time to dance
[1:00:02] a time to Cast Away stones and a time to
[1:00:05] gather Stones together
[1:00:07] a time to embrace
[1:00:09] and a time to refrain from embracing a
[1:00:12] time to get and a time to lose a time to
[1:00:15] keep and a time to Cast Away a time to
[1:00:18] Rend and a time to sell a time to keep
[1:00:21] silence and time to speak a time to love
[1:00:24] and a time to hate a time of war and a
[1:00:28] time of peace
[1:00:30] amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[1:00:32] one more time dear father
[1:00:34] Lord we love you just may uh your
[1:00:37] intention come forth in the word this
[1:00:39] morning Lord we love you Lord we
[1:00:41] appreciate you father
[1:00:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] amen so here we see a Abram which again
[1:00:49] very familiar passage to all of us but I
[1:00:52] I saw something recently in this that I
[1:00:54] just never quite saw before
[1:00:57] and that is that if you look at it here
[1:01:00] is
[1:01:01] if you just go you know the Lord said
[1:01:03] unto Abraham get the out of that country
[1:01:04] and from thy Kindred from my father's
[1:01:06] house unto a land that I'll show you
[1:01:09] and he leaves he does he follows the
[1:01:12] word of God
[1:01:13] he does he he does and of course we know
[1:01:15] there's some different things that he
[1:01:16] needed to process he brought lot with
[1:01:18] him he brought his data with him these
[1:01:20] different things and we know that
[1:01:23] um you know he he had a partial
[1:01:25] revelation of what God wanted him to do
[1:01:27] at the end of the day but he did hear
[1:01:29] the word of the actual word of the Lord
[1:01:31] and he did act on what the word of the
[1:01:35] Lord told him to do
[1:01:38] and then he immediately goes into a
[1:01:40] famine
[1:01:42] immediately I mean it's it's right there
[1:01:45] in the next passage God has given a
[1:01:47] promise all these different things and
[1:01:49] then he goes into you can see here again
[1:01:52] in uh
[1:01:53] in verse 9 at Abram Journey going on
[1:01:55] still toward the South and there was a
[1:01:58] famine in the land that Amber went down
[1:02:00] into Egypt and we often talk about the
[1:02:03] the part where he goes into Egypt but we
[1:02:06] don't talk so much about the famine
[1:02:08] about what was driving him uh to go down
[1:02:12] into Egypt and I'm just going to really
[1:02:13] quick
[1:02:16] if you don't mind actually Stephen can
[1:02:17] you help me for a second I just don't
[1:02:18] have time to do both at the same time
[1:02:19] can you make sure my screen doesn't shut
[1:02:21] off in here
[1:02:22] just keeps the power saving mode is on
[1:02:24] or something
[1:02:25] thank you
[1:02:27] there's a famine in the land and I just
[1:02:30] want to talk a little bit today on
[1:02:32] living in our season
[1:02:35] we're in a time right now outside it's
[1:02:37] it's winter time it's very cold outside
[1:02:41] um everyone's going down south praise
[1:02:43] the Lord if you want to come with me
[1:02:45] after this I have business cards no I'm
[1:02:48] just kidding um I have tracks to hand
[1:02:51] out for the you know Revival of warm
[1:02:53] weather that's happening in the south
[1:02:55] but it's a thing people go down to Egypt
[1:02:58] down to Phoenix
[1:03:00] from Minnesota in the winter time
[1:03:02] because it's it's a time where you know
[1:03:05] we're not harvesting here and very often
[1:03:08] you can find the natural typing the
[1:03:10] spiritual even in even in the very
[1:03:12] Physical Realm we talk about seasonal
[1:03:15] affective disorder is a thing people
[1:03:17] because there isn't enough sunlight out
[1:03:18] people aren't getting enough vitamin D
[1:03:20] people get more depressed people tend to
[1:03:21] gain weight up here like it's a thing we
[1:03:24] tend to find these Seasons at the
[1:03:27] at the macro level which is like the
[1:03:30] global level and then down into the
[1:03:31] micro level in our lives there's seasons
[1:03:34] and there are times did you get it
[1:03:36] sorted out thank you
[1:03:37] thank you
[1:03:39] appreciate that
[1:03:41] so Abraham
[1:03:42] follows the voice of the Lord and
[1:03:45] immediately goes into
[1:03:49] a famine and then he goes down into
[1:03:51] Egypt runs right into a problem we would
[1:03:54] think that if he's following the word of
[1:03:56] the Lord shouldn't good things happen
[1:03:58] right away
[1:03:59] shouldn't he immediately walk into some
[1:04:02] kind of like you know there should be
[1:04:04] some kind of sign there should be some
[1:04:05] something really good should happen and
[1:04:08] I think oftentimes this is the case in
[1:04:11] our Christian walks we make a turn
[1:04:13] towards the Lord and something bad
[1:04:16] happens
[1:04:18] we meet the Scarecrow on away on the way
[1:04:21] in a sense we meet the barrier
[1:04:24] that's trying to keep us from walking in
[1:04:27] the will of the Lord
[1:04:29] and of course we know the end of the
[1:04:31] story we can look over to Romans where
[1:04:33] we talk about how how at the end of the
[1:04:35] day that Abraham's Faith faltered not we
[1:04:38] know that and again we we read those
[1:04:40] scriptures and we know that that's true
[1:04:42] from God's point of view Abraham's faith
[1:04:45] in the end was concrete he didn't waver
[1:04:48] but I want us to peel back that kind of
[1:04:51] ecclesiastical like Viewpoint and put
[1:04:53] ourselves in Abraham's shoes today
[1:04:56] because just like us Abraham was a man
[1:05:01] he was a person he actually existed he
[1:05:04] actually went through you know waking up
[1:05:06] in the morning with a crick in his neck
[1:05:08] and he was tired and he I don't know if
[1:05:10] they had coffee back then but he might
[1:05:12] have been you know like you never know
[1:05:14] they had their rituals they had the
[1:05:16] routines they had the things that they
[1:05:18] did in order to feel happy in order to
[1:05:20] feel safe in order to make sure that
[1:05:22] they had quote unquote money in the bank
[1:05:24] and their bills were paid they had those
[1:05:26] those same desires because nothing is
[1:05:29] new Under the Sun everything that has
[1:05:31] been is the same today we might have
[1:05:33] more technology but at the end of the
[1:05:35] day we're all looking for a roof over
[1:05:37] our head food in our stomach
[1:05:39] companionship fellowship with our uh
[1:05:43] friends family loved ones
[1:05:45] Etc we're all looking for the same
[1:05:46] things the desires of man
[1:05:49] the trinkets may have changed the
[1:05:51] decorations may have changed but the
[1:05:54] desires are just the same
[1:05:57] and so Abraham goes into a famine and
[1:06:00] just kind of going back into
[1:06:02] Ecclesiastes here to everything there is
[1:06:05] a season in a time and purpose under
[1:06:08] heaven
[1:06:09] and we'll just kind of go down to uh
[1:06:12] yeah time to be born and a time to die a
[1:06:14] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[1:06:17] that which is planted he leaves and if
[1:06:21] you look at it he goes into a famine
[1:06:23] it's not a time to harvest
[1:06:26] it's not a time maybe not even a time to
[1:06:30] plant
[1:06:31] it's a time to Bear through it
[1:06:35] it's a time to persevere
[1:06:38] we look at winter time
[1:06:40] as it's very cold outside
[1:06:43] it is the time that we've been preparing
[1:06:46] for
[1:06:47] winter time the seasons they come every
[1:06:51] year on a regular cycle spring summer
[1:06:55] fall winter and we're so distant from
[1:06:59] that now in our you know quote unquote
[1:07:01] Modern Age that we tend to just like
[1:07:03] what see winter a lot of the times as a
[1:07:05] nuisance unless we really like the snow
[1:07:07] not me but we tend to see winter it's a
[1:07:11] lot colder outside and not a lot is
[1:07:13] happening
[1:07:14] most people are not like
[1:07:17] other than the holidays once the
[1:07:18] holidays are over then you know it's
[1:07:20] kind of the bearing through its season
[1:07:22] there aren't things growing outside it's
[1:07:25] not a season of growth it's a season
[1:07:27] where you're eating up your stores and
[1:07:30] if you didn't prepare for the winter
[1:07:33] you're gonna run out or you may run out
[1:07:35] and again we don't think about this with
[1:07:37] with Abraham leaving
[1:07:41] did he know he was going to go in right
[1:07:43] into a famine I would wager and again
[1:07:45] maybe I'm projecting but I want us to
[1:07:47] put ourselves in his shoes he just heard
[1:07:50] from God
[1:07:51] and like us
[1:07:53] I don't know about you but when I hear
[1:07:55] from God I'm just like wow this is
[1:07:57] amazing everything is about to be
[1:07:59] amazing I
[1:08:02] don't know why I still tend to think
[1:08:04] that because it's not the way it works
[1:08:06] it's it's like wow this is so exciting
[1:08:08] it's really more like you're about to
[1:08:10] suffer
[1:08:13] you are about to suffer big time mister
[1:08:15] and uh get ready for it
[1:08:18] and it is it is the Harvest that
[1:08:21] eventually is going to come that is the
[1:08:23] blessing but the season that we often go
[1:08:26] right into is the season of suffering
[1:08:30] so you want to read uh Psalms 23 the
[1:08:32] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he
[1:08:35] maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures
[1:08:38] he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he
[1:08:41] restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the
[1:08:44] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:08:46] sake yea
[1:08:49] though I walk sorry
[1:08:51] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:08:53] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:08:55] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:08:58] staff they comfort me thou prepares the
[1:09:01] table before me in the presence of my
[1:09:03] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[1:09:06] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[1:09:10] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:09:12] life and I will dwell in the house of
[1:09:15] the Lord forever
[1:09:17] and it's very this this passage is
[1:09:19] extremely interesting
[1:09:21] and and we look at this
[1:09:24] and I I there are many different ways to
[1:09:26] read this but I want to think of this
[1:09:27] again in this idea of seasons
[1:09:31] of there's a time to be walked to be led
[1:09:35] ingrained pastures
[1:09:37] there's a time to be led besides Still
[1:09:40] Waters
[1:09:42] there's a time where he restores our
[1:09:44] souls there's a Time
[1:09:46] where he leads us in the paths of
[1:09:48] righteousness for his name's sake
[1:09:49] there's a time when he leads us through
[1:09:52] the valley of the shadow of death
[1:09:55] and each of these times and these
[1:09:58] seasons are for a purpose and for a
[1:10:01] reason
[1:10:02] you even look at Abraham as he goes down
[1:10:05] to Egypt
[1:10:06] we see that first instance
[1:10:08] and of course we we major on the lying
[1:10:11] we see the first instance of him lying
[1:10:15] but I would wager before that we see the
[1:10:17] first instance of his fear
[1:10:20] we see his feet why did he lie because
[1:10:22] he was afraid
[1:10:24] he was afraid he still had faith in his
[1:10:28] soul in a sense of the promise of God
[1:10:29] because Sarah has to be around obviously
[1:10:31] in order for the promise to come forward
[1:10:33] everything else has to come forward and
[1:10:34] of course we know there's there's a
[1:10:35] progressive revelation of God
[1:10:37] sorry I'm cutting out up here a little
[1:10:39] bit uh the progression of God's uh
[1:10:43] revealing himself to him but we see this
[1:10:45] fear and of course we can see as it goes
[1:10:48] throughout his life
[1:10:49] he has a fear
[1:10:52] and in order for
[1:10:54] God to deal with that fear it has to
[1:10:57] first come out
[1:11:00] brother Branham talks about that the
[1:11:02] first that overcoming the enemy is
[1:11:04] recognizing him in every one of his
[1:11:06] tricks
[1:11:08] and there's I love the passage
[1:11:12] um the Bible talks about
[1:11:14] to know the truth and the truth will set
[1:11:16] you free
[1:11:18] you ever have a time where you've been
[1:11:20] dealing with the situation over and over
[1:11:23] and over whether it's with someone else
[1:11:25] or in your own life and you just can't
[1:11:28] figure out what's going on you don't
[1:11:30] know what's happening
[1:11:32] and sometimes this can go on for years
[1:11:36] but there's a moment of of
[1:11:39] revelation of Eureka where you suddenly
[1:11:43] realize this is what's happening this is
[1:11:46] the thing this this is the um
[1:11:54] we'll use a very easy oh well not an
[1:11:57] easy example but one we've all
[1:11:58] experienced lying
[1:12:00] if someone has lied to you you don't
[1:12:04] know there's a confu there's a element
[1:12:05] of confusion that has been entered into
[1:12:09] this relationship and it's distorted
[1:12:11] reality
[1:12:13] you now don't know what reality actually
[1:12:16] is because of a lie a lie creates a
[1:12:20] whole new world
[1:12:21] who talk about brother Branham talks
[1:12:23] about if we had enough faith we could
[1:12:25] speak a whole new world and go live in
[1:12:26] it and that's completely true in a very
[1:12:28] physical sense but we do that every
[1:12:31] single day of Our Lives
[1:12:33] everyone does not just Believers by the
[1:12:36] words we say and the things we believe
[1:12:39] we are literally creating our reality we
[1:12:42] are creating how we perceive the world
[1:12:44] even science is tapping into this at
[1:12:47] this point what we say and what we think
[1:12:50] and what we pay attention to you I think
[1:12:52] I've talked about this last time but
[1:12:54] it's called the reticular activating
[1:12:56] system you can go look it up it's the
[1:12:57] thing that we continually pay attention
[1:12:59] to eventually our brain prioritizes it
[1:13:03] and we no longer see anything else
[1:13:06] if you drove here today in a white car
[1:13:08] let's say if you have a Tesla right now
[1:13:10] Teslas
[1:13:12] pretty cool whatever some people love
[1:13:13] them some people hate them but the
[1:13:16] moment you start thinking man I want a
[1:13:18] Tesla I think I'm going to get a Tesla
[1:13:19] you go drive one around you're going to
[1:13:21] see Teslas everywhere
[1:13:23] you're going to see them everywhere and
[1:13:26] what was a novelty you're like wow I
[1:13:28] think I'll get a Tesla Tesla's are
[1:13:30] really awesome I'll be the only one at
[1:13:32] church that has one or whatever you know
[1:13:33] your
[1:13:35] you're going to notice they're
[1:13:37] everywhere and suddenly you'll you won't
[1:13:40] feel as special at all
[1:13:42] because they're everywhere because your
[1:13:44] brain prioritizes it to you similar to
[1:13:47] your own name if someone says Steve even
[1:13:51] if they're not talking to you brother
[1:13:53] Steve
[1:13:54] your brain automatically perks up like
[1:13:57] hey I know for me like all the time it
[1:13:59] happens like obviously my name is a word
[1:14:01] so if someone's talking in a like I'm in
[1:14:03] the restaurant I hear the word loyal I'm
[1:14:04] like
[1:14:05] who's trying to get my attention it's
[1:14:06] just weird it's a weird thing your brain
[1:14:08] can kick it out from a whole crowd of
[1:14:11] people can pick out your name because
[1:14:15] your brain calls that to your attention
[1:14:17] it's a part of your reality it's high
[1:14:20] priority to you
[1:14:22] and so
[1:14:24] um obviously like we're saying if if
[1:14:25] someone has lied to you it is the
[1:14:28] knowledge that you have been lied to
[1:14:31] that starts the process of setting you
[1:14:33] free you are able to start understanding
[1:14:38] if I was told this over and over and
[1:14:41] over again and it wasn't true and I've
[1:14:43] been living my life in accordance with
[1:14:46] this reality I first must understand
[1:14:49] that this isn't true
[1:14:53] in order to actually continue towards
[1:14:57] the truth
[1:15:01] the truth will set you free
[1:15:07] so I noticed what's really interesting
[1:15:10] here
[1:15:11] we're not going to kind of take a little
[1:15:13] bit of a detour but it's for a reason
[1:15:16] is
[1:15:17] we're going to talk a little bit about
[1:15:18] storytelling and about drama and there's
[1:15:21] a reason for it and I've got quotes to
[1:15:23] back it up brother Branham did very
[1:15:24] similar things so I think I have license
[1:15:26] to do this
[1:15:27] in film in books there's a there are
[1:15:31] principles that make a good story did
[1:15:33] you know that there are actually a
[1:15:35] finite number of stories
[1:15:37] at the end of the day in principle and
[1:15:39] in concept there are only so many
[1:15:41] variations of similar stories
[1:15:43] because at the end of the day Satan
[1:15:46] can't create and God can't lie and so
[1:15:49] everything that exists has to relate
[1:15:51] back to the truth in some way even a lie
[1:15:54] is just the truth misrepresented and for
[1:15:57] that reason there are principles and
[1:16:00] parallels and types that will always
[1:16:02] Shadow back to reality
[1:16:04] and it's this idea and again you can see
[1:16:06] it in the Bible in a lot of Dramas and
[1:16:08] stories have been written which you can
[1:16:10] tell have either been copied off the
[1:16:11] Bible intentionally or they caught onto
[1:16:14] the pattern of God they caught under the
[1:16:16] pattern which is it's often called the
[1:16:19] hero's journey the hero's journey the
[1:16:22] Ascension of and we use this actually in
[1:16:24] marketing all the time but the
[1:16:27] you have a person
[1:16:28] who has a problem that they can't solve
[1:16:31] themselves
[1:16:32] who meets a guide
[1:16:34] who has a plan that calls them to action
[1:16:37] so they end in success and avoid failure
[1:16:41] that is the basic story template now
[1:16:43] there's some derivatives of that there's
[1:16:45] a lot of different directions and
[1:16:46] there's there are inversions of that a
[1:16:49] person who has a problem who meets a
[1:16:53] false guide who has a plan that helps
[1:16:55] them end in failure and avoid success
[1:16:58] again there are inversions and they're
[1:17:00] different things
[1:17:01] but this is the the universal story in a
[1:17:04] sense and you can you go read any book
[1:17:07] this will ruin every movie you ever
[1:17:08] watch from now on there they will always
[1:17:11] you'll have a character it's the
[1:17:13] antagonist
[1:17:14] or the protagonist you'll have obviously
[1:17:16] a villain which is the problem you have
[1:17:18] a problem a situation something that
[1:17:20] they need to solve that they cannot
[1:17:22] solve themselves
[1:17:24] and I'm not going to go into like a list
[1:17:25] of movies and books that you know
[1:17:27] because that's going to get weird really
[1:17:28] fast but go think about it you can see
[1:17:31] this in the Bible even Christ as the
[1:17:34] hero comes to the Earth and is filled
[1:17:37] with the Holy Spirit the guide we look
[1:17:40] at when he gets baptized Jesus learned
[1:17:42] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:17:45] and so this is this is a continual theme
[1:17:48] and you can see it again in the story of
[1:17:51] Abraham Abraham is a person he's a guy
[1:17:54] 75 years old still living with his dad
[1:17:58] I think he's got some problems probably
[1:18:01] still living with his dad you know just
[1:18:03] you know living off that you know
[1:18:05] Daddy's income and business that he's
[1:18:07] running and he's like you know what I
[1:18:08] think life is good I'm just fine down
[1:18:10] here things are going great
[1:18:13] and
[1:18:14] he needed to suffer a little bit if you
[1:18:17] think about it he'd been living 75 years
[1:18:20] and he hadn't
[1:18:23] he hadn't taken on it in his own
[1:18:25] identity in a sense he's living under
[1:18:27] the identity of his father he hasn't
[1:18:30] gone out and and really learned anything
[1:18:34] on his own again as far as we know maybe
[1:18:36] there's something in that 75 years but
[1:18:38] we can only stick to what's what's
[1:18:40] written in the book
[1:18:46] so you have a hero's journey
[1:18:51] and it's typically broken into three
[1:18:54] Acts
[1:18:55] X
[1:18:57] act 1 act 2 and act three if you've ever
[1:19:00] seen a play if you've ever seen a movie
[1:19:02] again this is going to ruin it for you
[1:19:03] because it's always act one act two and
[1:19:05] act three if you've got a two hour you
[1:19:07] movie usually the first 45 minutes to an
[1:19:10] hour is act one act two the next half an
[1:19:14] hour the last half an hour is act three
[1:19:16] and in each of these stages of the story
[1:19:19] there are very specific purposes that
[1:19:22] need to take place act one is for
[1:19:24] character
[1:19:26] development you you learn who the
[1:19:29] character is you learn what their
[1:19:31] problem is typically there's a lot of
[1:19:33] like missteps there's a lot of learning
[1:19:36] there's a lot of different things and
[1:19:37] again we're I'm kind of like avoiding
[1:19:39] specific movies or stories or books or
[1:19:41] whatever but you get these very uh
[1:19:46] you get these caricatures of of the
[1:19:49] person you get the characteristics and a
[1:19:51] great story you'll learn who the person
[1:19:54] is what their problem is within the
[1:19:57] first five minutes of the story you
[1:19:59] learn very quickly and you can identify
[1:20:01] with them a great author is going to
[1:20:04] write it so that you're not really
[1:20:05] reading about that person you're reading
[1:20:08] about yourself
[1:20:10] you're able to step into that character
[1:20:13] because again it's dealing with the
[1:20:15] Human Condition we all
[1:20:17] are a hero on a journey in a sense we
[1:20:21] are all
[1:20:22] a person that has a problem
[1:20:27] we all have a problem we all got
[1:20:29] problems
[1:20:30] and thankfully hopefully all of us by
[1:20:33] today that are in this church we've
[1:20:35] already achieved
[1:20:38] the biggest problem has been solved
[1:20:40] we're saved
[1:20:43] the biggest problem has been solved
[1:20:46] now we're dealing with all of the
[1:20:48] smaller problems the things that we're
[1:20:51] dealing in our day-to-day lives
[1:20:54] and we need that guidance act two
[1:20:58] typically right around the end of act
[1:21:00] one is where they'll meet the guide end
[1:21:03] of act one or middle of act one is where
[1:21:04] they'll meet the guide
[1:21:06] and then they'll start working the
[1:21:08] process to start working the plan
[1:21:10] they'll fail a bunch of times and then
[1:21:13] typically around the going into act two
[1:21:16] they think they've got it all figured
[1:21:18] out because they've been listening to
[1:21:19] the plan of the guide right sometimes
[1:21:22] this is where they kill off the guide
[1:21:23] this is very common they'll kill off the
[1:21:25] guide so now the hero has to go on on it
[1:21:28] on their own
[1:21:31] they have to go out on their own you
[1:21:33] even look at with Jesus in The Garden of
[1:21:35] Gethsemane the Holy Spirit left him and
[1:21:39] he had to go on it on his own
[1:21:42] had to go on it on his own trusting in
[1:21:45] who he was as as a man without the Holy
[1:21:50] Spirit
[1:21:51] think about that
[1:21:53] he had to believe the word of God about
[1:21:56] him
[1:21:57] the same exact way that each one of us
[1:22:00] has to believe the word of God about us
[1:22:03] he goes and this isn't this is how act
[1:22:06] two Works act two is where you go to
[1:22:09] hell
[1:22:10] it's where villainy and evil seems to
[1:22:13] Triumph
[1:22:15] every story it's always the same
[1:22:18] you you all what you feel as if All Is
[1:22:22] Lost
[1:22:24] and again you can see the exact same
[1:22:26] thing in the Bible Jesus the guide has
[1:22:29] left him he goes to hell he dies
[1:22:34] this should be a tragedy the book that
[1:22:37] we that that the Bible I say the book
[1:22:39] because again
[1:22:42] I'm alliterating it to a story
[1:22:45] the book that we're reading should end
[1:22:48] as a tragedy that should be the end done
[1:22:50] like that should be the last page in the
[1:22:52] book and then we're done
[1:22:53] Tech like that's the way it should be if
[1:22:55] it's if it's written by by man about a
[1:23:00] man that's all that should be there
[1:23:02] but then we have Resurrection we have
[1:23:06] the restoration we've got the third Act
[1:23:09] the third Act of the story is where
[1:23:13] suddenly out of everything going wrong
[1:23:17] everything goes right
[1:23:21] everything goes right
[1:23:26] and We Know It's always darkest before
[1:23:29] the dawn It's always darkest before the
[1:23:32] dawn and we look at even with winter and
[1:23:35] spring it not going to say it's always
[1:23:37] coldest before the spring but it kind of
[1:23:39] feels like it your January February
[1:23:41] March with those cold winds blowing
[1:23:43] through I know the last winter that I
[1:23:44] was here was negative 30 for like a week
[1:23:46] and I got frostbite in my my right
[1:23:49] knuckle which was really annoying
[1:23:51] and uh
[1:23:53] it's cold
[1:23:55] it seems you think about it if we didn't
[1:23:57] have the return of the sun
[1:24:00] eventually everyone in Minnesota would
[1:24:02] die just saying I'm just kidding
[1:24:04] eventually it would get cold enough it
[1:24:08] would get cold enough if the sun just
[1:24:10] continued if or if the Earth kept
[1:24:12] tilting away from the sun eventually it
[1:24:14] would be negative 50 and then negative
[1:24:16] 100 and then you know
[1:24:19] eventually
[1:24:21] it would get cold enough it's the ER
[1:24:23] it's the season of death is winter
[1:24:30] three Acts
[1:24:32] of a story Psalms 23 the Lord is my
[1:24:36] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[1:24:39] to lie down in Green Pastures he leads
[1:24:41] me beside the Still Waters things are
[1:24:43] going awesome
[1:24:45] this is great let's just stop there
[1:24:47] let's all go God's Gonna Lead You In
[1:24:49] Green Pastures beside the Still Waters I
[1:24:51] think we can leave now but it doesn't
[1:24:53] end there he restores my soul that's
[1:24:55] amazing yes he leads me in the paths of
[1:24:58] righteousness for his name's sake
[1:25:01] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:25:03] the shadow of death
[1:25:05] and then it goes into this passage I
[1:25:07] mean it goes from everything that's
[1:25:09] amazing into yea the Y walk through the
[1:25:11] valley of the shadow of death
[1:25:13] but I'll fear no evil for I know you're
[1:25:16] with me and that's ultimately the
[1:25:18] promise that Christ gave us was that we
[1:25:20] are going to go through hell
[1:25:24] but he's with us and that's the the
[1:25:27] place that we can we can hold to
[1:25:31] steadfastly
[1:25:33] and then we can even see this
[1:25:35] that prepares the table before me in the
[1:25:38] presence of mine enemies it's overcoming
[1:25:40] the darkness it's overcoming the hell
[1:25:44] thou anoint is my head with oil my cup
[1:25:46] runeth over this is right in the middle
[1:25:48] of the trial of the darkness of the
[1:25:51] suffering any the the Ascension
[1:25:54] the act 3 of this passage is surely
[1:25:58] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:26:01] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[1:26:03] the house of the Lord forever it is it
[1:26:06] what's amazing about this
[1:26:08] it's that last verse is future tense
[1:26:13] all the rest of it is present tense
[1:26:16] the last verse is future tense it is the
[1:26:19] Hope and the belief of the Redemption of
[1:26:24] resurrection of the reward of the end of
[1:26:28] the darkness that is what that verse is
[1:26:30] talking about and it's all it's
[1:26:32] referencing as well that again you're
[1:26:35] with me at the end of the day that's
[1:26:37] what's important is that you're with me
[1:26:43] 1964 Shalom sorry I didn't send the
[1:26:46] quotes over so
[1:26:47] um
[1:26:48] now to you adults the scripture is God's
[1:26:51] Symphony yes Hallelujah
[1:26:54] only the composer knows what it really
[1:26:56] means and he reveals it to those who are
[1:26:59] listening who are interested in knowing
[1:27:01] what the drama is but you'd have to know
[1:27:04] about the symphony first see it's not
[1:27:08] just something you see it's the changing
[1:27:11] the junction of the word of the music it
[1:27:14] throws sometimes it's going this way for
[1:27:17] a while
[1:27:18] a certain beat after a while it changes
[1:27:21] all around what is it to you who
[1:27:24] wouldn't understand it or don't know
[1:27:26] nothing about it not interested in it
[1:27:28] it's just a racket it's a fuss but to
[1:27:31] those who know about it they're watching
[1:27:33] for it they know it's coming Hallelujah
[1:27:36] I think about this Ariel you'll probably
[1:27:39] appreciate this and the other musicians
[1:27:40] here will appreciate when I hear him
[1:27:42] talking about that to me I hear it's
[1:27:43] like he's waiting for the beat to drop
[1:27:45] in a sense it's like you can't hear that
[1:27:48] that's effectively what he's talking
[1:27:50] about there's a there's a point in music
[1:27:51] again typically you'll get it like
[1:27:53] halfway through the song or right before
[1:27:54] the course or something like that where
[1:27:56] you're you're pacing out the Rhythm and
[1:27:58] if it's like let's say a moderate Pace
[1:28:00] song but you want to take it up a little
[1:28:02] bit like I'll fly away or something you
[1:28:04] go from you know
[1:28:08] and then it'll like have a reprieve of
[1:28:10] like
[1:28:14] like and then it just goes really
[1:28:15] exciting it's waiting for the beat to
[1:28:17] drop and this is exactly what brother
[1:28:19] Brandon was talking about but to those
[1:28:21] who know about it they're watching for
[1:28:23] it they know it's coming and they don't
[1:28:25] even have to know the song as a musician
[1:28:29] you know the beat's about to drop if
[1:28:31] you've it like you know because the
[1:28:34] pattern is there you know it doesn't
[1:28:35] matter if you've heard the song before
[1:28:37] you know that based on all of your
[1:28:39] knowledge of all the other music that
[1:28:41] you've ever heard in your entire life
[1:28:43] that hey this is about the part where
[1:28:45] they're probably going to slow the song
[1:28:46] down and then the beat's gonna drop and
[1:28:48] it's gonna get really awesome and that's
[1:28:50] the moment when everyone jumps up and
[1:28:52] screams or whatever like again not
[1:28:54] trying to be clinical about it but that
[1:28:56] is how songs are written that's
[1:28:57] typically it's again back to this idea
[1:28:59] of
[1:29:01] the three acts even songs are written in
[1:29:04] this idea of the the pr the preposition
[1:29:08] the initial idea this this journey that
[1:29:12] you're suddenly coming on like wow this
[1:29:13] has got kind of a cool song oh man
[1:29:15] things are getting really bad and dark
[1:29:16] and intense so I'm like and then all of
[1:29:18] a sudden you have the glory and the
[1:29:20] resurrection
[1:29:24] uh again from Shalom uh at 199. now they
[1:29:28] had a sheet in their hand but what would
[1:29:31] they do they were trying to look back to
[1:29:34] a beat that had all a portion had
[1:29:37] already been played out
[1:29:41] they don't know the change of music
[1:29:46] and so for us we can go back to Abraham
[1:29:48] and parallel ourselves with Abraham
[1:29:52] Abraham may have thought again
[1:29:55] just putting myself in his shoes
[1:29:58] maybe I wasn't supposed to go this
[1:29:59] direction you know God did just tell me
[1:30:01] I'm just supposed to leave my my land
[1:30:04] and go into a land I'll show you I'm
[1:30:05] just going to leave go in this direction
[1:30:07] but now we're going down to Egypt and
[1:30:09] we're kind of running all over the place
[1:30:12] he didn't know what season he was in not
[1:30:16] in the sense of famine but what season
[1:30:18] he was in in the walk that he was in
[1:30:20] he didn't know the the pattern of God he
[1:30:24] was learning and progressing in the
[1:30:26] pattern and the walk with God
[1:30:29] and the same thing goes again we can
[1:30:31] take a lot of these quotes and look at
[1:30:33] it from a global sense of like the
[1:30:35] churches don't know the season we they
[1:30:37] don't know the time or the hour or the
[1:30:39] age but I like to take it down to
[1:30:42] local the body or to the individual the
[1:30:46] season that we are in as individuals not
[1:30:49] both in our lives as a whole you look at
[1:30:52] it your early 20s into maybe like
[1:30:55] mid-20s you're in a springtime of your
[1:30:57] life everything is about like globally
[1:30:59] you're any time where everything is just
[1:31:02] kind of growing and flourishing and
[1:31:04] seeds are getting planted who you will
[1:31:06] become is planted before you're 25.
[1:31:10] there's even studies that indicate that
[1:31:12] basically about until you're seven most
[1:31:15] of the stuff that you will become has
[1:31:17] already been planted in you the ideas
[1:31:20] and thoughts are already they're
[1:31:22] actually the documentary about this
[1:31:24] where they have followed people for the
[1:31:26] last 50 60 years every seven years and
[1:31:30] they have followed their lives it's very
[1:31:32] interesting and of course brother
[1:31:33] Branham talks about this as well he
[1:31:35] talks about when we're a child it's that
[1:31:37] planting season and those seeds are
[1:31:39] going to come forth and then in our
[1:31:41] lives you go into you know your 32 say
[1:31:45] whatever you know I guess time frame 30
[1:31:47] 40 50 whatever you go into a summertime
[1:31:50] and then hopefully by mid 50s 60s you're
[1:31:53] going to a Harvest Time where you're
[1:31:54] really harvesting and then of course we
[1:31:56] know you go into a winter from there
[1:31:58] it's the natural order of our lives but
[1:32:01] within that we have sub-seasons
[1:32:05] we'll call it times like generally our
[1:32:08] life is going in that direction but
[1:32:11] we're going to go through times and
[1:32:13] Seasons at a micro scale
[1:32:16] spring times where
[1:32:18] God is going to bring us through Seasons
[1:32:21] where it's time to grow
[1:32:23] it's time to plant
[1:32:25] and there are seasons where it's time to
[1:32:27] harvest
[1:32:29] and there are seasons when it's time
[1:32:33] to persevere
[1:32:35] to just push through
[1:32:37] and it's important that we know the
[1:32:40] change of the music in our lives
[1:32:43] to listen for the Rhythm and beat in the
[1:32:47] tune of Our Lives
[1:32:50] we can look at it in our lives sometimes
[1:32:53] um my pastor brother Aaron he talked
[1:32:56] about he preached a long series on
[1:32:58] barriers and boundaries
[1:33:01] and how it's important to know the
[1:33:02] difference between barriers and
[1:33:04] boundaries a boundary is what God places
[1:33:06] and a barrier is what Satan places a
[1:33:10] barrier is something that we have to
[1:33:11] press through
[1:33:13] barrier is something that's trying to
[1:33:15] keep us back
[1:33:16] from the promises of God and how do we
[1:33:19] know that it's a barrier because we can
[1:33:21] see the promise of God for us we can see
[1:33:24] the pattern of God we can see the music
[1:33:26] in a sense
[1:33:28] a boundary is where we're walking
[1:33:30] outside of the will and word of God and
[1:33:33] God will make will
[1:33:37] will make it evident to us in our lives
[1:33:40] eventually if we are our seed or a son
[1:33:42] of God we are going to run into
[1:33:44] boundaries where God says this is far
[1:33:47] enough and you're not going any further
[1:33:49] and you can push against it and you can
[1:33:51] fight against it and you can fight
[1:33:52] through it but God is going to make it
[1:33:54] as difficult for you as possible and
[1:33:57] ultimately the the distinction point
[1:33:59] point between the two of it is running
[1:34:01] it through the word of God completely
[1:34:04] the
[1:34:05] the Bible is an amazing book purely and
[1:34:07] again purely from
[1:34:10] a physical sense did you know that it is
[1:34:13] the first
[1:34:14] networked book it's an internet of its
[1:34:17] own accord there's some there there are
[1:34:20] tens and tens and tens of thousands of
[1:34:23] cross references
[1:34:25] into itself
[1:34:26] like a link like a hyperlink a website
[1:34:29] has all of these links that references
[1:34:31] back to other articles within the same
[1:34:34] website over and over and over and the
[1:34:37] Bible Acts just the same way you have
[1:34:39] tens and tens and tens and tens and tens
[1:34:41] of thousands I've seen some numbers all
[1:34:43] the way up over a hundred thousand but I
[1:34:44] don't remember the number right off the
[1:34:45] top of my head it is a self-contained
[1:34:48] book that continuously re-references
[1:34:51] itself over thousands of years which is
[1:34:55] amazing that's amazing in the uh data
[1:34:58] world this would be considered a single
[1:35:01] source of Truth a document that you
[1:35:04] reference all other documents by in
[1:35:07] order to validate their truth case in
[1:35:09] point in America we have the
[1:35:11] Constitution the Constitution is
[1:35:14] considered a single source of Truth now
[1:35:16] they're obviously updating and they add
[1:35:17] changes to it but everything else any
[1:35:20] judgments that are made in the country
[1:35:22] have to pass by the Constitution that
[1:35:26] has to be taken into consideration it is
[1:35:28] a single source of Truth and they don't
[1:35:30] get to just pick one part of it as to
[1:35:33] run through the whole entire thing there
[1:35:35] can't be you know a clause somewhere
[1:35:38] else that invalidates everything else it
[1:35:41] is continuous
[1:35:43] and so that brother random even talks
[1:35:45] about this that you have to be able to
[1:35:47] follow the thread Through the Bible
[1:35:50] because it continuously self-references
[1:35:52] over and over and over again and where
[1:35:55] we wind up with false doctrines at the
[1:35:58] end of the day is that people do not
[1:35:59] carry it through the Bible they don't
[1:36:02] carry it fully Through the Bible they go
[1:36:05] out on a limb and so what ends up
[1:36:06] happening is you have you can think of
[1:36:08] it like a line that should go back into
[1:36:10] itself it just goes out
[1:36:14] into outer darkness in a sense it's not
[1:36:17] referencing back to the source it just
[1:36:19] goes out
[1:36:26] carrying on in Shalom many people asked
[1:36:28] why they ask sometimes they ask me why
[1:36:32] why must these things happen
[1:36:34] why did this happen to me why did I
[1:36:37] start why did I start
[1:36:39] and this happened and I had this trouble
[1:36:42] here and this upset me here and I lost
[1:36:44] this here
[1:36:46] and then of course brother Brandon says
[1:36:47] sometimes I've asked why why when I was
[1:36:51] just a young Minister first started out
[1:36:54] did God take my wife right out from
[1:36:56] under me take my baby right from beneath
[1:36:58] me right beneath my heart why did he do
[1:37:01] that I didn't know I do now
[1:37:05] I just held my hand in his and kept
[1:37:08] trusting
[1:37:10] he knows every Junction he knows the
[1:37:13] Rhythm when it must take place he knows
[1:37:16] what it takes to mold you he knows what
[1:37:19] kind of material he's going to use the
[1:37:23] back side of the desert sometimes where
[1:37:25] God molds righteous men into sages and
[1:37:27] Prophets see that's where men are beat
[1:37:30] out men are beat out in the word when
[1:37:33] they got all kinds of creed and stuff in
[1:37:35] them let them come to the word and God
[1:37:37] beats it right out of them molds it
[1:37:40] right into this into the great Symphony
[1:37:42] with his word
[1:37:46] and I want to throw this in here because
[1:37:48] I think this is important
[1:37:50] when they get all kinds of Creeds and
[1:37:51] stuff we tend to make it's very easy to
[1:37:54] look at that and say oh that's for
[1:37:55] somebody else that's for someone
[1:37:57] somewhere else
[1:37:58] but a Creed
[1:38:01] is an ideal
[1:38:03] that's what it is a Creed is an ideal by
[1:38:05] which we live our lives you could think
[1:38:07] of
[1:38:08] um
[1:38:12] there's a saying what you've all heard
[1:38:14] which is not correct which is God helps
[1:38:16] those that help themselves it's not
[1:38:17] correct that's a Creed
[1:38:20] that's a Creed in a sense or a Creed
[1:38:23] could be if something needs doing I'm
[1:38:25] the one to do it that's a Creed not
[1:38:28] saying that it's necessarily a bad thing
[1:38:30] but it becomes a bad thing when it's our
[1:38:32] absolute
[1:38:34] and we have to be careful I think that
[1:38:36] today a lot of the times Satan has moved
[1:38:40] from the explicit Creed something that's
[1:38:43] very visible to the implicit Creed
[1:38:46] something that's internal you can't even
[1:38:49] see it you might not even know that you
[1:38:51] have it
[1:38:52] you can have the Creed of this is the
[1:38:55] way my culture does things this is the
[1:38:58] way my church does it this is the way my
[1:39:00] people and those things are fine and
[1:39:01] good
[1:39:02] until they get in the way of the music
[1:39:04] until they get in the way of the sheet
[1:39:07] music that God has you on you think of
[1:39:10] it again like a symphony like an
[1:39:11] orchestra there are many pieces of sheet
[1:39:14] music that have been handed out you've
[1:39:16] got the different you've got the
[1:39:18] different violins and you've got the
[1:39:19] cellos and you've got the the horns and
[1:39:21] you've got the vocals all of these
[1:39:23] different parts and pieces
[1:39:25] and each one of them has their own sheet
[1:39:28] music they're part of the same Symphony
[1:39:30] they're part of the same Orchestra
[1:39:32] they're playing the same song but
[1:39:34] they've got different parts
[1:39:37] even within the strings they might be in
[1:39:39] the same subgroup within that Symphony
[1:39:42] but they've got a different part to play
[1:39:44] they've got different notes to play and
[1:39:46] if they're only cheating off of their
[1:39:48] neighbor's sheet they're going to miss
[1:39:49] the notes they have to look at their own
[1:39:52] sheet and see what God wants them to do
[1:39:57] God wants them to do and we need to be
[1:40:00] able to do that not to be bound to a
[1:40:04] Dogma or weak or Creed that we live our
[1:40:07] lives by
[1:40:10] there here's a Creed
[1:40:12] this is actually going to be interesting
[1:40:14] I'm curious to see how this goes here's
[1:40:16] a Creed
[1:40:18] Minnesota nice
[1:40:21] Minnesota nice
[1:40:23] like as soon as I get back here it's
[1:40:25] actually really funny
[1:40:26] um we were at the this Christmas fair
[1:40:28] thing that was downtown and I just
[1:40:30] looked around I was like oh my goodness
[1:40:32] where are all the Latinos like I
[1:40:34] literally like that's exactly what my
[1:40:36] brain is like I'm living Phoenix now in
[1:40:38] Phoenix the Creed is this the West has
[1:40:41] not been won
[1:40:43] there's an attitude of get up before the
[1:40:47] Sun is up and get going and get on your
[1:40:49] horse and get going because you gotta
[1:40:50] fight like that's what it is the
[1:40:52] attitude is still there and the people
[1:40:54] you can feel it why because all of the
[1:40:56] people that successfully that
[1:40:58] successfully settled that area
[1:41:01] eventually had kids and eventually it
[1:41:04] became the culture of the place even
[1:41:06] brother Branham again talks about this
[1:41:08] everyone is ready to stick everyone else
[1:41:10] there there's this fighting like I'm
[1:41:12] ready to punch you and stab you and like
[1:41:14] that's just the not that they're act
[1:41:16] well some places they're actually doing
[1:41:17] it but
[1:41:19] that's the attitude it's this this high
[1:41:22] intensity atmosphere
[1:41:24] um whereas here in Minnesota it's like
[1:41:27] oh you can even feel it it's so funny
[1:41:29] going down to the fair it's just this
[1:41:30] feeling of like
[1:41:33] almost like pretentious it's kind of
[1:41:36] weird it's this this feel like now not
[1:41:37] living here and coming back it's kind of
[1:41:40] this pretentious folksy kind of like
[1:41:41] we're just better than everyone else
[1:41:43] like it's kind of weird it's this weird
[1:41:45] kind of like like we're so good everyone
[1:41:49] else is like I can't believe how how bad
[1:41:51] everywhere else is like there is this
[1:41:54] attitude you can feel it in the air it's
[1:41:56] actually really strange
[1:41:58] um now not have and I honestly I'm sure
[1:42:00] everywhere else I go I'm still
[1:42:02] Minnesotan and I come across the same
[1:42:04] way like look at how awesome I am I'm so
[1:42:07] great like not that I mean that but
[1:42:09] there's an attitude like I've actually
[1:42:11] had people talk to me about this like
[1:42:13] like or you know people are bothered by
[1:42:15] like my just like
[1:42:17] like my lack of like uh
[1:42:21] my ability to walk into situations with
[1:42:23] a smile on my face and I was like I'm
[1:42:26] here things are going to be great which
[1:42:28] is again this attitude there's a there's
[1:42:30] a until you leave you really can't see
[1:42:32] it but when you come back you can see it
[1:42:35] same thing and we go to Tennessee
[1:42:37] Tennessee wonderful place lived there
[1:42:41] Creed is uh the South will rise again
[1:42:45] there's this attitude of of and again
[1:42:49] not everywhere not everywhere but there
[1:42:52] is a general attitude of if you can't
[1:42:54] get your hands dirty down in the dirt
[1:42:57] and in the like there's an
[1:42:59] anti-education ideal in the sense of if
[1:43:03] that makes me not be able to put my
[1:43:04] hands in the dirt
[1:43:06] then I'm not I don't want any part of it
[1:43:09] but they respect people that are
[1:43:10] educated that can still get their hands
[1:43:12] down into their dirt if you're willing
[1:43:14] to get out there with with and again I'm
[1:43:16] generalizing but this is true like I
[1:43:19] learned if I'm gonna go to Tennessee I
[1:43:21] need to wear a colored shirt I need to
[1:43:23] wear jeans to church maybe a pair of
[1:43:25] cowboy boots and like a Carhartt jacket
[1:43:29] because that's what everyone wears
[1:43:31] everywhere you go obviously Africans
[1:43:34] like you guys love to dress up it's the
[1:43:36] African look it's this like
[1:43:40] there's there's this there's this
[1:43:43] there's this it's a Creed in a sense not
[1:43:47] saying it's right or wrong it isn't
[1:43:49] right or wrong it's em it's it's it's a
[1:43:52] it's an ideal that is uh inert in a
[1:43:55] sense it doesn't really matter it's
[1:43:57] great in a cultural sense in a in the
[1:44:00] cultural hierarchy it makes sense
[1:44:02] because you need to match the people
[1:44:03] that you're part of the group the part
[1:44:06] of the group says we need to all Wear
[1:44:07] Ties
[1:44:08] it's not that you need to wear a tire
[1:44:11] you're going to be a sinner it's more
[1:44:13] like this is what's considered
[1:44:14] respectable as a man you wear a tie or
[1:44:18] you wear a button-up shirt or what like
[1:44:20] that's that's the image it's actually
[1:44:22] again going back to the idea of the hero
[1:44:24] this is what a hero looks like to us in
[1:44:28] this group we can think of it back in
[1:44:30] the day you might have a night a night
[1:44:32] look was the hero of that time there's a
[1:44:34] million paintings about this or the
[1:44:36] night may have been uh you know a hunter
[1:44:39] if we go far enough back
[1:44:40] hunter-gatherers it's the idea of the
[1:44:42] hero the person that can go out and make
[1:44:45] things happen in the city the hero is
[1:44:48] it's a businessman it's someone with a
[1:44:50] suit on like there's this ideal if
[1:44:53] you're in a white collar world it's like
[1:44:54] this is you're wearing a suit you're
[1:44:56] wearing a tie like this is a hero if
[1:44:58] you're in a blue collar world like
[1:44:59] there's still there's a uniform of like
[1:45:01] this is a hero and then of course that's
[1:45:04] going to change regionally
[1:45:06] and again we said all that to kind of
[1:45:08] talk about Creeds and we need to be able
[1:45:12] to break beyond the Creed
[1:45:16] just because I'm in Minnesota and I wear
[1:45:20] a patterned shirt which patterned shirts
[1:45:22] are way more common in Minnesota by the
[1:45:24] way it's weird in the South they don't
[1:45:26] wear they wear solid shirts which is why
[1:45:28] brother Steve is wearing solid shirt
[1:45:29] because he's from Kentucky
[1:45:30] [Laughter]
[1:45:35] it's true
[1:45:37] there are these there
[1:45:39] if that becomes the main thing where
[1:45:42] it's like hey I am a Christian I mean
[1:45:44] look around I'm one of the group based
[1:45:46] upon the way that I'm dressing I look
[1:45:48] pretty good I look fresh
[1:45:50] like this is this is the way that it is
[1:45:52] or again even into the internal everyone
[1:45:55] else is doing here the real danger can
[1:45:58] be as much as our worship is amazing the
[1:46:01] Creed can become we have church and if
[1:46:04] you don't have church you're not a
[1:46:05] Christian
[1:46:07] if you can't come through that door and
[1:46:09] be dancing in the aisle then you're out
[1:46:11] you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:46:13] and we have to be careful to not make
[1:46:15] that the Creed it's it's the the purpose
[1:46:18] of it is to worship God is to aim at God
[1:46:23] in everything that we do the goal is to
[1:46:25] aim our desires our and our intentions
[1:46:28] towards God and he he will lead us into
[1:46:31] what we should be doing whatever that
[1:46:34] thing is
[1:46:37] in some places that's going to be you
[1:46:40] need to show up in a suit and tie and in
[1:46:41] other places that's going to be you
[1:46:43] should be in a T-shirt and jeans and
[1:46:45] flip-flops right Jordan get an amen
[1:46:48] praise the Lord because that's the right
[1:46:50] context for that in order to be
[1:46:54] approachable and in order to embody the
[1:46:57] spirit of God for that
[1:47:00] season for that place in the music
[1:47:04] you need to be sensitive in order to
[1:47:08] come and approaching in the way that God
[1:47:10] leads you in the time to play the notes
[1:47:14] that are on your music you can think
[1:47:16] about it
[1:47:17] um
[1:47:19] if you've been to a symphony
[1:47:22] very often there's there's a point where
[1:47:24] you come to a solo whether it can be a
[1:47:26] vocal or a string that's very common
[1:47:28] that it's a string sometimes it's like a
[1:47:30] trumpet but it's usually it's a single
[1:47:33] instrument
[1:47:34] you come to a point where all of a
[1:47:36] sudden
[1:47:38] it's like the clouds part and one
[1:47:41] stringed instrument is just playing and
[1:47:42] that's when everybody cries like I cry
[1:47:44] absolutely it's just a beautiful you
[1:47:47] know slow part or the cellos just
[1:47:49] digging in or maybe it's a trumpet
[1:47:51] depending on what it is what song it is
[1:47:55] and if that person playing that
[1:47:57] instrument was looking at the next
[1:47:59] person's over music they they would miss
[1:48:01] it and it was their time to play that
[1:48:06] part no one else was playing that part
[1:48:09] just them everyone else stops and they
[1:48:13] play
[1:48:15] and we are all that person I'm not the
[1:48:19] hero of your story
[1:48:20] you're the hero of your story each one
[1:48:23] of us have a walk that we have to walk
[1:48:27] we have a story that we are supposed to
[1:48:31] play out we have something that we are
[1:48:34] supposed to do if irrespective of
[1:48:37] everyone else here it's great that
[1:48:39] everyone else is here it's really nice
[1:48:41] like it's nice to see a full building
[1:48:42] that's amazing and yet our calling is to
[1:48:47] simply walk with him
[1:48:49] because at the end of the day
[1:48:54] poem that I love is that
[1:48:58] no matter who else is in your bed we all
[1:49:01] sleep alone
[1:49:03] we sleep alone with our thoughts
[1:49:07] and our mind we know
[1:49:11] we know
[1:49:13] when our bet our head hits the pillow at
[1:49:15] night we know
[1:49:18] we know whether or not we've been acting
[1:49:21] in accordance with our own conscience
[1:49:24] we know whether or not we've been
[1:49:27] really striving
[1:49:30] whether or not we've been missing the
[1:49:33] mark
[1:49:36] 1960 I know
[1:49:38] we ask for comfort and peace God gives
[1:49:41] us the best he could give us
[1:49:43] trials and tribulations that's better
[1:49:47] than comfort and peace our comfort is
[1:49:50] just beyond the river
[1:49:52] it was Abraham after he had seen the
[1:49:55] ground get Barren and the drought come
[1:49:57] and lot separate himself and go down to
[1:50:00] live deliciously into the world it was
[1:50:02] after he had heard the wines and cries
[1:50:05] of his herdsmen with no grass for his
[1:50:07] cattle but he maintained in the land
[1:50:10] that God gave him and told him to
[1:50:12] sojourn in and as on that day after he
[1:50:16] had been tried his patience was at the
[1:50:19] end
[1:50:21] you think about that his patience was
[1:50:23] spent
[1:50:24] he was done again we we don't
[1:50:27] 25 years
[1:50:31] 25 years and throughout this time God
[1:50:34] had come to him and made continuous
[1:50:36] intimations of the promise you think
[1:50:38] about that you think of the excitement
[1:50:40] of Abraham that here God's made him a
[1:50:45] promise he goes out
[1:50:47] goes into a famine goes to Egypt lot
[1:50:50] separates himself for all we know lot
[1:50:52] may have been his best friend
[1:50:54] sure there's a reason why lot came with
[1:50:57] him
[1:50:59] he cared for him he cared for his nephew
[1:51:02] but they had that bond that bond between
[1:51:05] the two of them I suppose not unlike
[1:51:07] Levi and myself if Levi's
[1:51:10] we're going out like I don't want to
[1:51:12] leave Levi behind
[1:51:15] that he he went through that process of
[1:51:19] of lot leaving him he goes on this
[1:51:23] journey and has these continuous
[1:51:26] instances of the spirit of God where God
[1:51:29] comes down again and makes himself known
[1:51:31] to him again and you think about that he
[1:51:34] didn't know it was going to be 25 years
[1:51:39] he didn't know it
[1:51:42] each time God comes to me thinks this is
[1:51:45] it
[1:51:45] they're getting ready it's gonna oh it's
[1:51:48] tomorrow it's happening right now
[1:51:52] and then he goes another year
[1:51:55] and then another year and then another
[1:51:57] year and it might have been three four
[1:51:59] five years since God talked to him
[1:52:02] his patience was at the end
[1:52:16] I want to dwell on that just a minute
[1:52:18] like because again we we can go right
[1:52:20] into because we know and we can finish
[1:52:22] the quote but as it was on that day that
[1:52:24] went after the trial was over he spake
[1:52:26] face to face with Elohim under the oak
[1:52:28] that day and we know that part
[1:52:31] but he was at the end 25 years I'm going
[1:52:37] to jump over to just for a second to
[1:52:39] David
[1:52:40] yeah David is anointed king
[1:52:45] little kid probably not that much older
[1:52:48] than Levi maybe I don't know maybe a
[1:52:50] teenager
[1:52:52] he's he's
[1:52:53] anointed by God
[1:52:55] to be king
[1:52:57] not that long after that he's playing
[1:53:00] music in Saul's Court things are looking
[1:53:02] pretty good he kills Goliath everyone's
[1:53:06] super stoked about it he comes best
[1:53:08] friends with Jonathan the King's son it
[1:53:11] looks like it should just work just
[1:53:14] right
[1:53:17] and little does he know he is about to
[1:53:19] go off a cliff
[1:53:21] and he's going to spend who knows how
[1:53:23] long how many years and years and years
[1:53:30] suffering
[1:53:32] I want to just jump over here really
[1:53:34] quick go to Psalms
[1:53:36] and I'm watching the time here we're
[1:53:38] coming to a uh brother kydra digs close
[1:53:41] so
[1:53:49] let's go to Psalms 88.
[1:54:03] one of many Psalms that say basically
[1:54:06] the same thing but I think that this is
[1:54:08] great O Lord God of my salvation I have
[1:54:11] cried day and night before thee let my
[1:54:14] prayer come before thee incline thy ear
[1:54:16] unto my cry for my soul is full of
[1:54:20] troubles and my life draws nigh unto the
[1:54:23] grave I am counted with them that go
[1:54:25] down into the pit I am as a man that
[1:54:28] hath no strength
[1:54:35] that one has lit I'm just kind of
[1:54:36] skipping through this thou has laid me
[1:54:38] in the lowest pit in darkness in the
[1:54:41] deeps thy wrath lieth hard upon me and
[1:54:44] thou has Afflicted me with all thy waves
[1:54:50] verse 12 shall thy wonders be known in
[1:54:52] the dark and thy righteousness in the
[1:54:54] land of forgetfulness
[1:54:57] but unto thee have I cried O Lord and in
[1:55:00] the morning shall my prayer prevent thee
[1:55:02] Lord why cast this thou off my soul why
[1:55:05] hidest thou fit thy face from me I am
[1:55:09] Afflicted and ready to die from my youth
[1:55:12] up
[1:55:16] from my youth up you look at this
[1:55:21] suffering
[1:55:23] suffering
[1:55:27] while I suffer the terrors
[1:55:30] I am distracted which that we're
[1:55:32] distracted means distraught thy Fierce
[1:55:35] wrath goeth over me thy Terrors have cut
[1:55:38] me off they came round about me daily
[1:55:40] like water they come pass me about
[1:55:42] together
[1:55:44] lover and friend hast thou put far from
[1:55:47] me in mine acquaintance Into Darkness
[1:55:51] now I haven't gone and sourced all this
[1:55:53] to see what time this was to say he's
[1:55:55] writing obviously about Jonathan and
[1:55:59] Etc but I think we can all get the idea
[1:56:02] David went through a lot of hard times a
[1:56:05] lot of hard times wrote a lot of songs
[1:56:07] about it and just as much as there are a
[1:56:10] lot of songs rejoicing there are a lot
[1:56:12] of song songs suffering
[1:56:15] a lot of songs suffering and he's not
[1:56:19] shy about it
[1:56:21] he's not shy about bringing that
[1:56:23] suffering to God
[1:56:26] why have you cast me off why is this
[1:56:30] happening to me and he's bringing that
[1:56:32] to God and yet we know that David was a
[1:56:34] man after God's Own Heart he is not
[1:56:37] professing a profession of unbelief in
[1:56:40] God
[1:56:42] he is earnestly contending with God
[1:56:46] he is wrestling with the angel
[1:56:49] he is he is
[1:56:52] holding on
[1:56:54] to God and asking for the
[1:56:57] for the third Act
[1:57:01] he's crying out for the third act when
[1:57:04] how long how long am I going to stay
[1:57:08] here in this hell
[1:57:10] how long is this going to go on
[1:57:14] and he's crying out for it
[1:57:18] he's crying out for that Redemption
[1:57:30] 64.
[1:57:32] actually no I'm going to grab this from
[1:57:34] Luke 14.
[1:57:40] verse 26.
[1:57:45] If any man come to me and hate not his
[1:57:48] father and mother and wife and children
[1:57:51] and Brethren and sisters yea and even
[1:57:55] his own life also he cannot be my
[1:57:58] disciple
[1:58:02] that's a hard statement
[1:58:04] that's a really hard statement it
[1:58:07] doesn't just say
[1:58:08] that
[1:58:10] he's willing to love me more it's that
[1:58:11] if he doesn't hate them
[1:58:13] and again it's a hard statement what
[1:58:15] this is actually getting at is those
[1:58:18] that are not willing to surrender to me
[1:58:21] to fully surrender to go beyond family
[1:58:25] principles family Creeds family ideals
[1:58:29] family patterns family problems
[1:58:34] to follow me and to trust in me
[1:58:39] they cannot be my disciple if we're not
[1:58:41] willing to lay aside
[1:58:44] our our family
[1:58:46] Creed and are even even down to
[1:58:51] this runs in my family or this is just
[1:58:54] the way we do this lore or whatever we
[1:58:57] have to be able to go beyond that to
[1:59:00] walk with God to truly walk with God to
[1:59:03] be able to forsake it
[1:59:07] and to let go of the things of the past
[1:59:10] and not carry them forward in our lives
[1:59:13] we've all got problems we all got things
[1:59:16] again going back to that season of
[1:59:17] growing When We're Young when our kids
[1:59:19] were teenagers and we do stupid things
[1:59:24] and we're going to do more stupid things
[1:59:25] but
[1:59:26] [Laughter]
[1:59:28] we do stupid things and they haunt us
[1:59:31] they carry forward with us and we think
[1:59:34] this is who we are you think again of
[1:59:36] David
[1:59:38] I was anointed to be king
[1:59:42] King I was in the court
[1:59:45] maybe I messed up
[1:59:48] maybe I missed the will of God
[1:59:51] maybe God he's not just saying maybe
[1:59:54] God's forsaking sake of me he's saying
[1:59:57] you have forsaken me
[2:00:00] why have you forsaken me
[2:00:03] he didn't know that he was eventually
[2:00:05] going to come back around
[2:00:09] he didn't actually know for all he knew
[2:00:12] like he is holding on to that anointing
[2:00:13] those were brutal times
[2:00:17] brutal times they're living in caves
[2:00:20] like this is you know we think about if
[2:00:23] we go over into the Middle East with
[2:00:25] with with uh the uh
[2:00:28] different bands that are out there that
[2:00:30] are coming in at guerrilla warfare that
[2:00:33] was David hiding out in the case a
[2:00:35] guerrilla Warrior that's literally what
[2:00:37] he is
[2:00:39] and he didn't know that that wasn't that
[2:00:42] there was a destiny I read a book
[2:00:44] recently it's called The Tale of Three
[2:00:46] Kings it's very good I recommend it you
[2:00:48] can write it down and it talked about
[2:00:50] the three different types of kings in
[2:00:54] the stories of Saul
[2:00:55] David and Absalom
[2:00:58] beautiful book you can parallel it out
[2:01:01] into and I'm just taking a Tanzania I
[2:01:03] know we need to close
[2:01:05] Saul
[2:01:06] is someone who is Anointed by God he is
[2:01:09] Anointed by God and in a lot of ways
[2:01:12] he's just like boom you look at it the
[2:01:15] the contrast couldn't be more different
[2:01:17] here is a person the people picked gets
[2:01:20] you know and no one did his King crowned
[2:01:22] everything starts going great
[2:01:24] and eventually he gets he's possessed by
[2:01:28] the need to keep his power
[2:01:33] and you can parallel this into churches
[2:01:37] ministers that are put in place
[2:01:41] and they are afraid to lose that power
[2:01:44] and you can watch The Tyranny that
[2:01:47] starts to play out anyone that's a
[2:01:50] threat in their Kingdom
[2:01:54] Saul David on the other hand
[2:01:57] is a person who is the unlikely hero
[2:02:01] this is a person who's got a lot of
[2:02:03] profits clearly a lot of problems
[2:02:07] and if you look at these even anointed
[2:02:09] when he's very young you can imagine
[2:02:11] that that may have gone to his head
[2:02:14] you know all my brothers got passed over
[2:02:16] and look at me
[2:02:18] I'm the guy like I'm the stuff look at
[2:02:20] me I'm in the castle now and I like it's
[2:02:23] growing great it's going great and God
[2:02:26] took him through as a leader
[2:02:29] a season of suffering for years and
[2:02:32] years and years and years so that when
[2:02:34] he did attain power he knew how to
[2:02:38] handle it
[2:02:39] he knew how to handle that power and it
[2:02:42] didn't go
[2:02:43] he didn't go to his head and then you
[2:02:45] can parallel that into the way David
[2:02:47] handled Absalom David didn't act like
[2:02:51] Saul you think about it he could have he
[2:02:54] could have acted exactly like Saul and
[2:02:57] he could have held on to that I need to
[2:03:00] con to maintain power but he didn't
[2:03:04] he actually in a sense let go and he
[2:03:07] gave it back into the hands of God
[2:03:09] he recognized the season he was in he
[2:03:14] recognized the change in the music and
[2:03:16] he recognized why things were happening
[2:03:18] the way it was
[2:03:20] he got it
[2:03:22] then Absalom and we'll just grab this
[2:03:24] really quick before we kind of shift
[2:03:25] gears Absalom as a king
[2:03:28] as he desired to be king made himself
[2:03:31] King
[2:03:32] he seized power he is what David could
[2:03:35] have been
[2:03:37] you think about it David had every right
[2:03:40] to do what Absalom did
[2:03:42] he's anointed by God he had people
[2:03:45] backing him and yet when Saul comes into
[2:03:48] the cave right we know the story Saul
[2:03:51] comes into the cave they're hanging out
[2:03:52] David has the opportunity with his
[2:03:54] mighty men people that killed lions and
[2:03:57] hundreds of Philistines by themselves
[2:03:59] they have the opportunity to get rid of
[2:04:02] this Tyrant right here
[2:04:05] and yet David didn't
[2:04:08] because it was I will not strike down
[2:04:10] the Lord's anointed and you think about
[2:04:13] it if if he had struck him down
[2:04:17] the season may not have been ready
[2:04:19] the people may not have been ready it
[2:04:22] may have divided the country
[2:04:24] God had a time and a season for David to
[2:04:28] come to that position
[2:04:31] and even though before it might have
[2:04:33] looked good it might have been like you
[2:04:34] know what Saul is eventually going to
[2:04:36] die Jonathan's going to hand over the
[2:04:37] throne to David something like that but
[2:04:39] there would have always been this
[2:04:42] lingering
[2:04:44] division
[2:04:45] in the people
[2:04:47] there always would have been and then
[2:04:49] Absalom of course seizes power he he
[2:04:52] without character
[2:04:56] has been handed an immense amount of
[2:04:59] privilege to be a son of a king
[2:05:02] and it goes to his head and you can see
[2:05:04] this very often the same way people who
[2:05:07] grow up in a strong Church
[2:05:10] they don't know what it's like to suffer
[2:05:16] they don't get it they don't understand
[2:05:18] that this didn't happen by itself
[2:05:22] right that the Blood Sweat and Tears of
[2:05:26] those that went on before
[2:05:28] is what made this possible
[2:05:36] may we be like Solomon and ask God give
[2:05:41] us wisdom to know how to rule this
[2:05:44] people and in a sense in the the
[2:05:46] opportunities that are put in front of
[2:05:48] us both carnally and spiritually God
[2:05:50] cares about what we have to deal with in
[2:05:53] the day today
[2:05:54] may we pray God give us wisdom to know
[2:05:58] how to engage with these opportunities
[2:06:02] may we know how not to
[2:06:08] not to be stupid to be honest like for
[2:06:11] lack of a better term I'm just using
[2:06:12] that term as a very just blunt like
[2:06:15] to not be Fools With The Grace that's
[2:06:18] been handed to us
[2:06:23] you see this as well and again I'm kind
[2:06:25] of coming into but I just I'm going down
[2:06:27] this channel
[2:06:29] just in in the natural sense you look at
[2:06:32] generations of families
[2:06:35] where there's a season where they fought
[2:06:37] and they strove and they
[2:06:41] Hard Times make hard men
[2:06:45] and hard men make good times
[2:06:48] Good Times make weak men and a weak men
[2:06:51] make hard times
[2:06:53] that's what happens it's the season and
[2:06:56] the cycle
[2:06:58] it's the cycle
[2:07:00] pay attention to the season and the
[2:07:04] cycle that you're in that we don't go
[2:07:06] into a hard time that we could have
[2:07:10] avoided
[2:07:13] may we play the sheet of music that's in
[2:07:15] front of us that we
[2:07:19] that we can pay attention and be in tune
[2:07:21] with the spirit and the leading of God
[2:07:23] again both as a church as a whole
[2:07:27] and as an individual
[2:07:31] Proverbs 3
[2:07:34] 11 my son despise not the chastening of
[2:07:37] the Lord neither be weary of his
[2:07:39] correction there are seasons that we go
[2:07:42] into
[2:07:43] of chastening
[2:07:46] Seasons where it just feels like you're
[2:07:48] just getting beat
[2:07:50] over and over and over and over again
[2:07:55] there are seasons there's a reason for
[2:07:57] it
[2:07:58] there is a reason
[2:08:00] I think that
[2:08:04] we've had so much churchianity
[2:08:07] and we know so much
[2:08:11] we can I mean I just think of it today
[2:08:13] it's like
[2:08:14] we can pull up the Bible on our phone
[2:08:16] and we can listen to the whole message
[2:08:18] on the phone we have access to all of
[2:08:20] the knowledge oh like 95 of the
[2:08:24] knowledge in the world on our phone
[2:08:27] we have a a tremendous gift and yet
[2:08:34] what that often creates is
[2:08:39] understanding
[2:08:41] but not experienced
[2:08:45] we know a lot about it we can tell you
[2:08:48] everything about it it's like people
[2:08:50] that know batting averages
[2:08:52] they they can tell you all about the
[2:08:54] sports player every single detail about
[2:08:57] it
[2:08:59] but if you ask them to go out there and
[2:09:00] really throw a football or hit a ball
[2:09:02] they couldn't do it
[2:09:07] we must
[2:09:09] Shalom God let talking about Paul God
[2:09:13] let a messenger of the Devil Keep beat
[2:09:16] down talking about Paul he said then
[2:09:18] when I'm weak I'm strong amen Growing
[2:09:21] Pains of Grace
[2:09:25] God brings us
[2:09:28] uh
[2:09:30] quote number 227 and sometimes it takes
[2:09:33] hard trials to break the bands of the
[2:09:36] world off of us
[2:09:39] it takes hard trials
[2:09:42] to put our theories to the test the
[2:09:45] things that we have in our heads that
[2:09:47] were like I got this I really know this
[2:09:49] I got it down and then we get the trial
[2:09:52] we get the suffering that forces us to
[2:09:57] take action and to actually act it out
[2:10:00] surrendering isn't and again it's
[2:10:03] wonderful we should sing I surrender all
[2:10:06] because we're professing it we're
[2:10:08] professing the surrender
[2:10:10] but real surrender
[2:10:13] is when God has you in a headlock down
[2:10:16] on the ground and if you don't
[2:10:18] you know you can't get out of it
[2:10:23] and you gotta give in surrender you
[2:10:27] gotta tap out
[2:10:29] that is surrender
[2:10:32] and may we all
[2:10:34] in surrender entrusting in Walking with
[2:10:37] God God help us to
[2:10:41] do
[2:10:43] not just think it but to actually be
[2:10:46] able to take that action and it's the
[2:10:47] grace of God in those times
[2:10:50] coming to a close
[2:10:52] in those times the musicians can go
[2:10:54] ahead and come
[2:10:56] in those times of suffering
[2:11:01] in The Growing Pains of Grace
[2:11:04] may we hear the shift in the music
[2:11:09] both going into the suffering and
[2:11:11] recognizing it's about to get real dark
[2:11:13] because this is the point in the story
[2:11:15] where it got real dark and it gets real
[2:11:17] dark
[2:11:18] and may we also see that
[2:11:24] ultimately
[2:11:27] it's not a tragedy
[2:11:30] it's not a tragedy even if Eve you look
[2:11:33] at job again I love the story of Job
[2:11:36] it's not a tragedy
[2:11:41] there was a Tipping Point where it all
[2:11:46] it's the definition of a comedy in story
[2:11:48] it's actually it's actually kind of
[2:11:51] funny you think about it from God's
[2:11:53] point of view he's joking around with
[2:11:54] the devil from God's point of view it's
[2:11:56] like this is great it's actually comedy
[2:12:00] to which in the technical sense of
[2:12:02] Comedy is any story that ends out well
[2:12:04] any story that ends with something great
[2:12:08] happening the Bible in the end is
[2:12:10] laughter it ends well
[2:12:13] it ends in our favor
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:23] last two just one more quote in a
[2:12:25] scripture
[2:12:26] from the world is falling apart we want
[2:12:28] everything just everything so we can
[2:12:31] take it easy and retire and take life
[2:12:33] easy life wasn't intended to be easy
[2:12:37] life is a struggle anything that's got
[2:12:40] life is a struggle look at the trees how
[2:12:43] they struggle look at everything that's
[2:12:45] got life it's a struggle and when we try
[2:12:48] to get some kind of a system that takes
[2:12:50] it easy then we're wrong and we know
[2:12:53] there's something wrong
[2:12:55] God help us to reinterpret the struggle
[2:12:58] as the good thing in our life
[2:13:01] I don't know about you but when things
[2:13:03] are going really well you get kind of
[2:13:05] bored
[2:13:06] everything is so soft and easy and just
[2:13:10] we turn into
[2:13:14] God help us to see the struggle as the
[2:13:17] adventure of Our Lives
[2:13:20] as exciting
[2:13:22] that we know that things are happening
[2:13:26] again
[2:13:29] if you're reading a book if you're
[2:13:31] watching a movie it's not very good
[2:13:34] unless you unless you have Stakes if you
[2:13:38] have a reason
[2:13:40] you have something that you're trying to
[2:13:42] achieve you have something that you're
[2:13:43] trying to overcome
[2:13:46] God help us to see our own lives that
[2:13:49] way that we may have gone through a
[2:13:51] season of Darkness or we may be going
[2:13:53] through a season of Darkness but that's
[2:13:56] not our end
[2:13:57] that isn't our end
[2:13:59] they that sow in tears shall reap in Joy
[2:14:02] they sowed in the right season and they
[2:14:05] will reap in the right season
[2:14:08] praise the Lord amen
[2:14:10] [Music]

[2:21:06] when it gets in the way of you serving
[2:21:08] the lord
[2:21:10] that's where the problem starts
[2:21:12] you know in
[2:21:14] I know we we normally give testimonies
[2:21:16] in the beginning of service
[2:21:18] I want and I would like to give this
[2:21:20] quick testimony
[2:21:23] pertaining to my birthday being tomorrow
[2:21:26] you know
[2:21:28] I have met a family that I've known
[2:21:31] back
[2:21:33] yesterday and it had brought back a
[2:21:34] memory to my mind of
[2:21:38] it was a while ago on Mother's Day I
[2:21:40] know my mom remembered this
[2:21:43] so is my dad but it was a while ago on
[2:21:45] Mother's Day and you know I wasn't
[2:21:48] really right with the Lord me
[2:21:50] or my brother at the time
[2:21:52] and we used to smoke we used to do stuff
[2:21:55] like that
[2:21:56] and it was after service we had hopped
[2:21:59] on the highway and was driving
[2:22:02] because my cousin my other cousin me and
[2:22:04] my brother in the back
[2:22:07] and we had dropped all the windows
[2:22:09] because my auntie did not like us
[2:22:10] smoking her car
[2:22:12] so we try to cover up the scent
[2:22:15] so we dropped all the windows my cousin
[2:22:17] had drove on the highway he looked at
[2:22:19] his brother he said should we take the
[2:22:21] highway he's been like no let's just
[2:22:22] take the back roads
[2:22:25] he said no wrong take the highway
[2:22:27] and he hopped right on the highway when
[2:22:29] he did that
[2:22:30] he went all he tried to go all the way
[2:22:31] to the left lane as he was going
[2:22:34] a car was coming
[2:22:36] so my brother was in the behind the past
[2:22:39] behind the driver's seat he said AOE
[2:22:41] watch out
[2:22:43] as soon as he said that my cousin had
[2:22:45] pulled the wheel real hard
[2:22:47] and when he had did that the car started
[2:22:49] swerving on the highway he's probably
[2:22:51] going like 75 80. the car started
[2:22:54] swirling on the highway
[2:22:56] you know cars that was beside it started
[2:22:58] to slow down everything is going really
[2:22:59] slow
[2:23:01] and
[2:23:03] it seemed like he was getting control of
[2:23:05] the car we ended up from the middle left
[2:23:08] lane all the way to the right it seemed
[2:23:09] like he was getting control
[2:23:11] and all of a sudden
[2:23:13] he hit the dirt on the side of the road
[2:23:16] and the car flew in the air
[2:23:18] car rolled 10 to 15 times on the highway
[2:23:21] and as it was rolling my cousin the
[2:23:24] passenger seat flew out the sunroof
[2:23:26] because we opened the window
[2:23:28] I looked to my brother
[2:23:30] and it was just flipping he was just
[2:23:32] like this big guy is just rolling in his
[2:23:34] car like I couldn't believe what I was
[2:23:37] seeing and my window was down nobody's
[2:23:39] wearing seat belts but the driver
[2:23:42] and my body was going out in the car out
[2:23:44] in the car was like something was
[2:23:45] holding me
[2:23:47] you know in
[2:23:49] sometimes that comes back to my heart a
[2:23:51] lot but it didn't it hit me yesterday
[2:23:53] because of a family I've seen you know
[2:23:55] they had came after everything
[2:23:57] and God is just so good you know because
[2:23:59] if I would have died in that moment
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:05] that that would have been the end
[2:24:08] and I just want to give
[2:24:10] cuz
[2:24:11] if it wasn't for him
