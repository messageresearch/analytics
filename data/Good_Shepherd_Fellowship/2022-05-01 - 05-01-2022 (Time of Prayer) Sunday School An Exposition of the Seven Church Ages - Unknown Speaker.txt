TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they said that they were rich in goods and spiritually wealthy they had arrived they had need of nothing but god saw it otherwise he said you don't know this but you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked now when a people are that way especially naked and don't know it there has to be something awfully wrong surely something must be happening is it not that god has blinded their eyes as he did to the jews is the gospel going back to the jews is history repeating itself i say it is god says this church of the laodicean age is wretched that word comes from two greek words which mean endure and trial and it has nothing to do with the trials that come to a true christian for god describes a christian in trial as blessed and his attitude one of joy whereas this description is phrased as wretched and miserable how strange in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance how can there be trials well no it is strange but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had but with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pep pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boasts of its tremendous stories of worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts of better moral values and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge and science but it is fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we have gone all the way from the horse and buggy age to the space age and we are proud and boastful about it but inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason man's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace sayeth my god to the wicked they are miserable that means that they are objects to be pitied pitied they scorn pity they are full of pride they want what they have but what they have will not stand the test of time they have built upon quicksand rather than the rock of the revelation of god's word soon cometh the earthquake soon there will come the storms of the wrath of god in judgment then comes sudden destruction and in spite of all their carnal preparation they will still be unprepared for what comes upon the earth they are those who in spite of all their worldly efforts are actually opposing themselves and don't know it objects of pity are they indeed pity the poor people who are in this last day ecumenical move for they call it the move of god when it is of satan pity those who do not know the curse of organization pity those who have so many beautiful churches such lovely parsonages such grandly trained choirs such a show of wealth and such a sedate and reverent form of worship pity them don't envy them back to the old store buildings back to the dimly lit rooms back to the sellers back to less of the world and more of god pity those who make their great claims and talk about their gifts feel for them as objects of pity for soon they will be objects of wrath they are poor they are poor now of course that means spiritually poor the sign of this age as it closes is bigger and better churches with more and more people with more and more manifestation of what is supposed to be demonstrations of the holy ghost but the filled altars the gifts of the spirit in operation the remarkable attendance is not the answer from god for those who come to the altars very seldom stay to go on with god and after the great campaigns are finished where are all those who came down the aisles they heard a man they listened to an appeal they came into the net but they were not fish and turtle-like they crawled back to their own waters then there is all this talk about the glossolalia it is supposed to be the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost and people are thinking that we are in the midst of a great revival the revival is over america had her last chance in 1957 now the tongues are god's sign of impending disaster even as they were when they appeared upon the wall at belshazzar's feast don't you know that many are going to come in the last day and say lord lord have we not done many wonderful works in thy name even to the casting out of devils and he will say depart from me ye that work iniquity i never knew you matthew 7 22-23 jesus said they were workers of iniquity yet you get a man that can come and pray for the sick get oil and blood appearing in the congregation prophecy coming forth and all manner of the supernatural and the people will gather around him and swear that he is of the lord even though he is actually making a money racket of religion and living in sin the only answer they have is the absolutely unbiblical answer of well he gets results so he must be of god how terrible how actually poor this age is in the spirit of god and the poor poverty-stricken ones don't even know it you are blind and naked now this is really desperate how can anyone be blind and naked and not know it yet it says that they are blind and naked and can't perceive it the answer is they are spiritually blind and spiritually naked do you remember when elisha and gehey's eye were surrounded by the army of the syrians you recall that elisha smote them blind by the power of god yet their eyes were wide open and they could see where they were going the blindness was peculiar and that they could see certain things but other certain things such as elisha and the servant and the camp of israel they could not see what this army could see did not avail for them what they did not see brought on their captivity now what does this mean to us it means exactly what it meant back there in the earthly ministry of jesus he tried to teach them truth but they would not listen john 9 40 through 41 and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also jesus said unto them if ye were blind you should have no sin but now you say we see therefore your sin remaineth the attitude of this age is exactly what it was then people have it all they know it all they cannot be taught if a point of truth from the word comes up and the man tries to explain his view to one with an opposing view the listener is not at all listening that he might learn but is listening only to refute what is being said now i want to ask a fair question can scripture fight scripture does the bible contradict the bible can there be two doctrines of truth in the word that say the opposite or oppose the other no it cannot be so yet how many of god's people have their eyes open to that truth not even one percent as far as i know have learned that all scripture is given by god and all is profitable for doctrine reproof correction etc if all scripture is thusly given then every verse will dovetail if given a chance but how many believe in predestination unto election and reprobation unto destruction those who don't will they listen no they will not yet both are in the word and nothing will change it but to learn about it and reconcile the truth of those doctrines with other truths that seem to oppose they will not take the time but they stop their ears and gnash with their teeth and they lose out at the end of this age a prophet will come but they will be blind to all that he is doing and saying they are so sure they are right and in their blindness they will lose it all now god says they are naked as well as blind i cannot imagine anything as tragic as a man who is blind and naked and does not know it there is only one answer he is out of his mind he is already deep in oblivion his faculties are gone spiritual amnesia has set in what else can it mean can it mean that the holy spirit has taken his leave of this last day church can it mean that men have put god out of their minds to such an extent that it is happening even as stated in romans 1 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to reprobate minds to do those things which are not convenient it surely appears that something like that has happened here is a people who say that they are of god and know god and have his holy spirit and yet they are naked and blind and don't know it they are already deceived they have the wrong spirit the elect cannot be deceived but it is evident that these others are these are they who have become blind because they refused the word of god these are they who have stripped themselves naked by leaving god's care and protection and sought to build their own way of salvation their own tower of babel by organization oh how lovely and beautifully dressed they appear in their own eyes as they form their general assemblies and their councils etc but now god is stripping it all away and they are naked for these organizations have but led them into the camp of antichrist into the field of tears right up to their binding and burning objects of pity indeed they are yes pity them warn them beseech them and still they go their way headlong to destruction wrathfully turning away any and all attempts to save them as brands from the burning miserable indeed they are yet they know it not calloused and beyond hope they glory in what is actually their shame defiant against the word yet one day they shall be judged by it and pay the price of its awful indictments the final council of the ages revelation 3 18-19 i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent the counsel of god is terse it is to the point he directs this last day church to one hope that hope is himself he says come to me and by it is evident from this phrase by of me that the laodicean church is not at all dealing with jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of god their transactions cannot be spiritual they may think that they are spiritual but how can they be the works in their midst are definitely not as paul would say god in you willing and doing of his own good pleasure philippians 2 13 thus what about all these churches schools hospitals missionary ventures etc god is not in them as long as they are denominational seed and spirit and not the seed and spirit of god by of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich now these people had plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind it was that gold that bought man's lives and destroyed them it was the gold that warped and twisted human character for its love was the root of all evil revelation 18 1-14 and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled filled to her double how much she have glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord god who judgeth her and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thy in wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble and cinnamon and odors and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men and the fruits that thy soul lusteth after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all this is exactly the organized churches of the last day for it says in verse 4 come out of her my people the rapture has not yet taken place the bride is not yet gone when these terrible conditions in this rich false church exist but there is a gold of god first peter 1 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of god is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that is the right kind of gold but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it is rich it is complacent it has made affluence the major criterion of spirituality the evidence of god's blessing and the correctness of doctrine etc is now based upon how many rich folks are involved in it you had better come before it is too late saith the lord and by of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before god so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction or will it be the softness of this character-less laodicean people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden now i said that the city of laodicea was a wealthy city admitted gold coins with inscriptions on both sides gold coins characterized the age a flourishing commerce existed because of it today the two-headed gold coin is with us we buy ourselves out and we buy ourselves in in the church we attempt to accomplish the same we buy ourselves out of sin and by ourselves into heaven or so we say but god does not say that the church owns such phenomenal wealth that at any given time she can take over the entire world system of commerce and indeed a leader in the world council of churches has openly prophesied that the church and the foreseeable future should could and will do just that but their golden tower of babel shall fall only the gold tried in the fire shall endure and that is what the church has constantly done through the ages she has left the word of god and taken her own creeds and dogmas she has organized and joined herself to the world thus is she naked and god is judging her lewdness the only way she can get out of this dread situation is by obeying the lord to come back to his word revelation 18 4 come out of her my people second corinthians 6 14-18 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part have he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and i will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty there is a price to pay for those garments and that is the price of separation and anoint thine eyes with eyes that thou mightest see he does not say that you have to buy this i salve oh no there is no price tag on the holy spirit received ye the spirit by the works of the law or the hearing of faith galatians 3 2 without the baptism of the holy ghost you can never have your eyes opened to a true spiritual revelation of the word a man without the spirit is blind to god and his truth when i think of this isab opening people's eyes i can't help but recall when i was a little boy in kentucky my brother and i slept in the attic on a straw pallet the cracks in the house would let the drafts blow through sometimes in the winter it would get so cold we would wake up in the morning with such colds in our eyes that our eyes would be shut tight with inflammation we would cry out to mother and up she would come with some hot grease and rub our eyes until the hardened matter was gone and then we could see you know there have been some awful cold drafts blowing on the church in this generation and i'm afraid her eyes have sort of frozen shut and she is blind to what god has for her she needs some hot oil of the spirit of god to open her eyes unless she receives the spirit of god she will go on substituting program for power and creed for word she counts numbers for success rather than to look for fruit the doctors of theology have shut the door to faith and for bad all to enter they neither go in nor let anyone else go in their theology comes out of a textbook on psychology written by some unbeliever there is a textbook on psychology one we all need it is the bible it is written by god and contains god's psychology you don't need any doctor to explain it to you receive ye the holy spirit and let him do the explaining he wrote the book and he can tell you what is in it and what it means first corinthians 2 9-16 but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ now if all the things that the spirit is crying out against are true of this age we need someone to come on the scene as did john the baptist and challenge the church as never before and that is exactly what is coming to our age another john the baptist is coming and he will cry out exactly as did the first forerunner we know that he will because of what the next verse says as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent revelation 3 19 this is the same message that john had as he cried out in that religious wilderness of pharisees sadducees and heathen repent there was no other course then there is no other course now there was no other way to get back to god then and there is no other way now it is repent change your mind turn around repent for why will ye die let us examine the first phrase as many as i love in the greek the emphasis is upon the personal pronoun i he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make jesus the object of human love in this verse no it is the many that are the loved ones of god it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorying in his salvation his purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of god even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob have i loved does it now obtain that since he loved only the many is he therefore in a state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh him by no means is this so for he declared also in romans 9 13 he saw have i hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit for it says that the purpose of god stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has in himself because before the children were born he had already said jacob have i loved but esau have i hated [Music] you
