[27:48] Let's read from James chapter 5 tonight.
[27:52] [clears throat]
[27:54] James chapter 5
[28:04] to the tech team. I just uh u send you
[28:09] my
[28:11] my notes I will be using when I got him.
[28:15] So if you if you have not got it just
[28:18] look in the email you see it.
[28:21] Let's read James chapter 5 tonight is uh
[28:29] let's read from verse 13.
[28:32] Very familiar.
[28:35] Very familiar.
[28:37] Is any among you afflicted? Let him
[28:39] pray. Is any married? Let him sing
[28:42] psalms. Is any sick among you? Let him
[28:46] call for the elders of the church and
[28:50] let them praying over him, anointing him
[28:53] with oil in the name of the Lord. Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; On Sunday, we spoke a little bit on the
[29:01] anointing. The anointing break the
[29:03] yolks. That's one of the reason why I
[29:05] read this scripture tonight. But let's
[29:07] continue. And the prayer of faith shall
[29:10] save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
[29:13] him up. And if he have committed sins,
[29:17] they shall be forgiven him. Praise the
[29:22] Lord.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stop right there. Father, we
[29:27] will ask blessing upon your word
[29:29] tonight. We want to go in the same land
[29:32] of thought
[29:33] uh uh the anointing of the hour that the
[29:37] church has to respond to. So we just
[29:40] pray that you would come and bless us
[29:43] now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. The Lord
[29:47] bless you. You may have your seat.
[29:50] Praise the Lord.
[29:52] Amen. Amen.
[29:58] Now, so I want to I want to just uh
[30:02] start up here by reading something to
[30:05] you from uh faith [snorts]
[30:08] in the son of god. [clears throat]
[30:11] Faith in the son of god. And we'll go
[30:13] into our subject tonight. Good good
[30:17] faith in the son of god.
[30:22] Now the pastor
[30:24] if if he's not a gifted man or sofa with
[30:29] understanding
[30:31] he did better anoint the man with oil
[30:35] because
[30:37] that's what stands between him and the
[30:40] sickness.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; That's that's one of the main reason why
[30:46] I read that scripture tonight. It is
[30:49] It's a Bible ordinance. It's a Bible
[30:52] instruction.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Call for the other and let him and and
[30:56] let the sick be anointed with oil. Amen.
[30:59] It remain the word of God. It stays
[31:02] remain the truth. But why is it done?
[31:05] Why do we do it? The reason why is there
[31:09] uh uh sometime ago one one brother a
[31:12] friend of mine called and he says uh he
[31:14] says brother one do you have anointing
[31:17] oil? I said yes I do.
[31:19] He says, "I would want some." I says,
[31:21] "For what?" Said, "Well, I I just I just
[31:24] want to have some in my house to, you
[31:27] know, to uh to anoint my home and uh uh
[31:31] I can't remember the details. What for
[31:33] bad dreams
[31:36] and all that, praise the Lord."
[31:39] And I was I was trying to pull his legs
[31:42] a little bit. I says, "Well, the Bible
[31:45] say we must call for the
[31:49] Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; I said the Bible says we must call for
[31:53] the elder and uh uh have you got your
[31:57] editorship yet?
[32:00] Praise the Lord. Now because I say this
[32:03] because uh I mean with uh with uh uh
[32:07] this Laia age is a is a spiritual age.
[32:10] It's a very high religious age. Amen.
[32:14] and uh and and all of that all of these
[32:17] things are done. You know, people just
[32:18] think, you know, you get an anointing
[32:20] oil or you you shake it in the corner of
[32:22] your house and you know, you going to
[32:25] drive demons away or you going to drive
[32:27] evil spirits away. Praise the Lord. I
[32:30] will tell you that those spirits will
[32:32] not go away if there is something in
[32:34] your life that is attracting it.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The spirits just don't
[32:40] come in a board in our home or in our
[32:43] neighborhood is is is the people that
[32:46] attracts it. We have to realize that
[32:50] spirits are spirits and and and uh uh
[32:54] they don't have no ability. They can do
[32:56] nothing until they have a vessel
[33:00] &gt;&gt; to work through.
[33:03] Praise the Lord. Until that spirit have
[33:06] a vessel, until that spirit has a nature
[33:09] that it can attach itself to is
[33:12] powerless.
[33:15] Both the spirit of the devil and also
[33:17] the spirit of God.
[33:20] Until the spirit of God has a body that
[33:23] he can work through,
[33:25] he's just going to remain almighty God
[33:28] with all of his power and everything
[33:30] that he can do until he has a vessel
[33:33] that he can work through.
[33:36] Are we together?
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:41] So uh uh uh uh I I had I had to look for
[33:45] this quickly to just throw it into my my
[33:49] presentation tonight. Uh uh
[33:53] [clears throat]
[33:54] I was talking talking with a sister on
[33:57] Sunday and and this came across my mind.
[33:59] So uh I remember it tonight. So I said
[34:02] well okay I know uh used this long time
[34:06] ago now. So the pastor once again if
[34:10] he's not a gifted man or so forth with
[34:14] uh understanding he he he did better
[34:16] anoint the man with oil because
[34:20] that's what stands between him and and
[34:24] the sickness the the the anointing oil
[34:28] stands between the sick person and the
[34:32] sickness. Praise the Lord.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It also stands between the
[34:36] preacher and the sickness. Are we
[34:38] together?
[34:40] [clears throat]
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Or he could take it himself. Now he
[34:45] takes he takes the order that James gave
[34:49] them the elder of the church and let him
[34:52] anoint him with oil and pray over them.
[34:55] That's exactly the church to anoint with
[34:59] oil. That oil represent the Holy Spirit
[35:02] stands between the pastor and the
[35:05] sickness. That's right. He anoints them
[35:08] with oil representing the Holy Spirit.
[35:11] Just giving over to the Holy Spirit. You
[35:15] are giving the situation over to the
[35:18] Holy Spirit. Amen. Then he prayed for
[35:21] the person. And I have seen it. I have
[35:24] seen it. I've seen uh uh uh uh praying
[35:28] for someone that is sick. I mean, we
[35:31] were one many years ago praying for the
[35:33] sister that was dealing with something.
[35:36] And because of the way that she was
[35:38] moving herself, we had to bring in some
[35:40] of the the sisters, the pastor wife and
[35:43] all of that. And right after they s
[35:46] their prayer, the the the brother's wife
[35:49] got so sle. You know, it was just very
[35:52] resol. She she had to be with him for
[35:55] for a while and we knew straight that.
[35:57] Yeah. That was that was an effect of
[36:00] there. Praise the Lord.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; So, uh I just that is just an appetizer.
[36:07] Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; I just had to go that way tonight so I
[36:12] can I can be able to where to balance.
[36:15] But uh it's good to be with you tonight.
[36:16] Amen.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. It's good to be
[36:21] with you tonight. So uh uh on uh on
[36:25] Sunday,
[36:27] we were talking on the church responding
[36:30] to her anointing.
[36:33] Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; We were talking on the church responding
[36:36] to her anointing. If uh if uh if the
[36:40] brothers Emmanuel, if you can go back to
[36:42] my note on Sunday and uh uh
[36:48] we were talking on the church responding
[36:50] to her anointing and we want to read we
[36:54] want to read uh uh uh the quote that we
[36:57] read there from the fifth seal.
[37:01] Praise the Lord.
[37:04] Amen.
[37:09] I have a portion of it uh drawn with
[37:11] this but I want to go back to there for
[37:15] for some reason now from the pill this
[37:18] this is what we read and that's where
[37:20] our inspiration was from don't forget
[37:23] this church
[37:25] and you brethren on tape I want you to
[37:28] examine this
[37:33] how could a man do anything else beside
[37:35] the power of God that has been released
[37:39] to them. Praise the Lord. How can a man
[37:43] do anything else beside the power of God
[37:46] that been released to them?
[37:48] I'm going to set this box up here to
[37:51] represent that
[37:54] if God send a certain spirit among them,
[37:58] that's the only thing that they can work
[38:01] by is the spirit that is working among
[38:05] them. Praise the Lord.
[38:08] Now we will prove to you by the history
[38:12] of the church and the opening of the
[38:15] seals and the power that is left loose.
[38:19] Now watch exactly the church responding
[38:22] to the anointing and it couldn't do
[38:25] nothing else. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[38:30] So, uh, uh, this this whole thing of,
[38:33] uh, Revelation 4, five, and 6 that we've
[38:37] been dwelling on, like I said, I'm I'm
[38:40] not a teacher. I'm not a teacher. Uh,
[38:43] uh, so I had uh there there there's a
[38:47] tendency of uh making teaching to
[38:49] preaching. And that's what I've been
[38:51] doing because I'm not really staying on
[38:54] the subject to be able to just carry you
[38:57] through like the way a teacher would do
[39:00] it. So, uh, so I'm sorry I'm doing a
[39:03] very poor job. Praise the Lord. But, uh,
[39:07] uh, I need I need to do it because
[39:10] that's what my inspiration is. So, I
[39:12] hope that is a blessing to you. Praise
[39:14] the Lord.
[39:15] and uh uh down there in um Zimbabwe
[39:20] after after the the meeting
[39:24] uh we preach one of the live message to
[39:26] close the meeting and uh the brother
[39:29] said well brother War is uh you you are
[39:31] a teacher I said no I'm not a teacher
[39:34] says well but what you did was a
[39:35] teaching I well I hope you know who a
[39:38] teacher was amen and praise the Lord
[39:43] so
[39:45] Let's uh let's go ahead here.
[39:53] Emmanuel, if you want to put my image
[39:55] up.
[40:02] If you want to put my image up. The one
[40:04] with the parade.
[40:08] Good. Good. Good. Good.
[40:12] Hallelujah.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6. Let's go back to
[40:16] Revelation chapter 6.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Now, so
[40:31] uh we were we've been dwelling on this
[40:33] for a while, a whole while. And and I
[40:37] think if I stay more on it, you might
[40:39] start seeing it in your dreams.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; And it should not make you afraid with
[40:46] everything that we have said about this.
[40:48] When you dream about it, it should not
[40:49] make you afraid. Praise the Lord.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh uh these were
[40:56] representing the full uh evil power,
[41:00] evil beast that is waring against the
[41:02] church. If you read uh Revelation
[41:05] chapter 9, you will understand that when
[41:07] the bottomless pit was open, there was a
[41:09] dark smoke that came out of the
[41:11] bottomless pit. That was a release of
[41:13] demon powers into the earth. So that's
[41:15] what this represent. So these are the
[41:18] powers. Amen. And uh uh if you also read
[41:22] the book of Daniel, you'll see where
[41:24] Daniel is talking about, you know, the
[41:26] the different beasts and different
[41:27] powers that that was waring in his age.
[41:30] They are all represented here one way or
[41:32] the other
[41:33] &gt;&gt; and these are also the anointing that is
[41:36] given to counter this. Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; When the enemy come as a flaw,
[41:43] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord will raise up
[41:46] &gt;&gt; extender.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; So this anointing was the standard of
[41:50] God in the church ages. [snorts]
[41:53] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; They were the standard of God in the
[41:57] church ages to resist the lies of the
[42:00] devil.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; To resist the lies of the devil. Now,
[42:07] because if we know how these things
[42:10] work, if we know how they work, we will
[42:14] know how to be able to to order our
[42:19] thoughts.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now take take for
[42:25] example the greatest battles ever
[42:28] fought. The mind is the battleground.
[42:31] Are we together?
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it is these two powers that
[42:38] are war against our mind.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:48] But what happen is that sometimes we
[42:50] blame ourself for those thoughts
[42:54] and we don't re really realize that is
[42:57] the enemy that is channeling those
[42:58] thoughts through our mind.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; So uh uh that's the reason why we want
[43:12] to look we want to look at it very
[43:14] close. We want to look at it very very
[43:17] close. Praise the Lord.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve. Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful father we
[43:40] have.
[43:42] Praise the Lord. Now so we said uh uh uh
[43:46] there is something I want I want to come
[43:48] to tonight
[43:50] uh uh because you see our age which is
[43:55] under the ego's anointing
[43:58] is is a little bit different from the
[44:02] rest of these ages.
[44:05] Praise the Lord. Okay. All of these
[44:09] rainbow color blocks representing the
[44:11] seven church ages. Our age is a little
[44:15] bit different. And and that's what I
[44:18] want us to I want us to be able to pay
[44:21] attention to. The reason is that
[44:25] the reason when Jesus said
[44:30] you are in this word but you are not
[44:33] part of the word. Praise the Lord.
[44:36] You are in this word. He was speaking to
[44:38] his disciples but you are not part of
[44:41] the word. It kind of describe our age.
[44:47] Praise the Lord. Because
[44:51] the age in general is the Laudisha
[44:55] church age.
[44:57] Praise the Lord.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] And uh uh
[45:05] let me see.
[45:10] Do we have another block that has the
[45:12] church ages name by the side
[45:16] in uh in all our pictures?
[45:28] Okay. Yeah, let's use this one.
[45:31] Yeah, let's use this one
[45:35] now. So, uh uh uh
[45:38] Okay. Yeah, it comes with the statue of
[45:40] the perfect man now. So, uh
[45:47] like I said, our age is a little bit
[45:49] different and it's it's beautiful. Yeah,
[45:51] let's let's use this one. It's
[45:54] beautiful. The anointings are there. The
[45:56] messengers are there. The church ages
[45:58] are there. Okay, let's deal with this
[46:00] now. So, uh
[46:04] when we look at this, like I said, the
[46:08] lion's anointing
[46:11] right here
[46:13] operated
[46:14] in these three church ages.
[46:18] Praise the Lord.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It operated in these three church
[46:23] ages. the Ephesole, the Samad and the
[46:27] Pagamos church ages were under the lion
[46:30] anointing.
[46:32] Now
[46:33] under these these uh uh three church
[46:37] ages, that was where the white horse
[46:41] rather ruled.
[46:43] Amen. Revelation chapter 6. Let's go
[46:46] there. Let the picture stay up. Turn to
[46:49] your Bible if you have it with you. If
[46:51] not, just follow the reading. We'll keep
[46:53] the picture up for now. And I saw when
[46:56] the lamb opened one of the seal.
[47:00] We said on Sunday we will represent the
[47:03] lamb because we have the Bible in our
[47:05] heads. The Bible represent the book of
[47:07] life. The book that was sealed with
[47:09] seven seals. So we will represent the
[47:12] lamb.
[47:14] And then you are John.
[47:17] Praise the Lord.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are John because John
[47:21] represent the bride.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; So [clears throat] John is the one
[47:27] narrating to us here. And I saw when the
[47:30] lamb open one of the seal are open and
[47:33] he says and I heard as it was a noise of
[47:37] thunder
[47:39] and one of the four beasts which is one
[47:42] of these anointing. And in this in this
[47:46] condition now where we are reading it
[47:49] will be the lion anointing.
[47:52] Praise the Lord.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; The lion anointing is the one now that
[47:57] is saying one of the four beast saying
[47:59] come and see. Praise the Lord. Amen. So
[48:05] uh uh this beast is calling to you John
[48:11] to come and see what I have open.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; The lamb has the book open.
[48:21] And this anointing is calling to the
[48:25] church to come and see
[48:28] what is on this seal. Are we together?
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh here here is the
[48:35] principle that that is lying in there
[48:37] that actually you cannot see when Jesus
[48:41] said the devil comes to steal, kill and
[48:44] destroy. There is no way you can be able
[48:48] to identify it in your age until you
[48:51] have heard the voice of your anointing
[48:55] that is saying come and see.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; We as humans there is no way we can be
[49:07] able to identify the working of the
[49:10] devil.
[49:14] I will tell you tonight that there are
[49:16] even things that war in our life that we
[49:20] can attribute to the devil because of
[49:24] the way uh uh the nature of that thing
[49:27] is. But actually when you when when when
[49:30] you really look at it through the eyes
[49:32] of your messenger, he will tell you that
[49:35] it's your family strain.
[49:39] Praise the Lord.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; He will tell you that it's your family
[49:43] strain. And and some of these family
[49:45] strain that we deal with in our life,
[49:48] they are things that we will have to
[49:50] keep under the blood. We will have to
[49:54] keep like like brother Brandham says, we
[49:56] will have TO KEEP IT HONOR PRAYERS
[49:59] BECAUSE THOSE are the areas WHERE THE
[50:00] DEVIL HAS THE right to hit you.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; We will have to keep it honor prayers
[50:12] and and and and for some of us it will
[50:15] be until we get a body change.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Until we get a body change.
[50:29] Now, so that is the thing that is
[50:31] important because you see there is there
[50:34] the the church in many ways uh uh uh you
[50:37] know uh believing in God. Where did I
[50:40] put my mark now? Okay.
[50:44] Know where my hand? Okay. Have it right
[50:45] here. Now the church in many ways
[50:50] it brings us to the place where
[50:52] sometimes we we we get frustrated.
[50:57] Amen. Now take this even with the
[51:01] apostle Paul
[51:03] that that familiar scripture my grace is
[51:07] sufficient
[51:09] my strength is made perfect in your
[51:12] weakness.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that what
[51:19] Paul was referring to that the Lord told
[51:21] him his grace was sufficient is because
[51:24] Paul had an eye problem.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; It was not something that he was born
[51:30] with. It was something that affected his
[51:34] eyes from the light of the pillow of
[51:36] fire.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] God uh humbling that educated uh jewel
[51:47] that that that young jewel boy that was
[51:50] so zillious. God way of humbling him was
[51:54] to be able to affect him. I mean HE SAW
[51:57] THE LIGHT UH UH SHINING so bright and he
[52:01] could even identify it scripturally when
[52:04] he said Lord who art thou?
[52:08] Praise the Lord.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] and he heard the very name that he was
[52:13] he was persecuting. I'm Jesus.
[52:19] Praise the Lord.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; I call him to the testimony. Paul got
[52:26] blind. He was led.
[52:30] The book of Acts says they led him by
[52:32] the hands and and and and and God had to
[52:36] tell Ananas to go and meet Paul
[52:38] somewhere. He's blind. I just blinded
[52:40] him. Go and meet him. Ananas said,
[52:42] "Well, I've heard that that is the man
[52:44] that is persecuting the church." God
[52:46] said, "Don't worry. That one I've
[52:47] already knocked him off." Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't be afraid. I've
[52:53] already knocked that one. He's one of us
[52:54] now.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; So, Ananas went prayed for him. He
[52:59] received his sight.
[53:03] But the eyes still have problem.
[53:08] And until he died, he never got healing
[53:14] to his eyes.
[53:16] The more he prayed about it, the more it
[53:18] bother him. In one of his writing, he
[53:21] said, "I even had to write with big
[53:23] letters
[53:25] because of my eyes."
[53:29] Are we together?
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; But you see, that never had anything to
[53:34] do with the Holy Ghost. He had
[53:36] &gt;&gt; that never had anything to do with his
[53:37] new birth.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; That never had anything to do with what
[53:41] God was doing in his life. Even with THE
[53:43] EYE PROBLEM, PAUL WAS UH I mean he was
[53:47] he was he was uh h bold to stand in THE
[53:50] SYNAGOGUE. EVERY GIVEN OPPORTUNITY.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Every given opportunity.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see we cannot be able to
[54:06] rightly identify the working of the
[54:09] devil.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Remember now Hebrew chapter 4:12 tells
[54:15] us that the word of God is sharper
[54:19] &gt;&gt; like a two-edged sword. And what it does
[54:21] is that it counts
[54:24] and it separate. It goes at the dividing
[54:28] aunder of your soul and your spirit.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was I was looking at there today
[54:38] is it's very beautiful. I was I was
[54:40] actually looking at there today and uh
[54:43] uh uh
[54:49] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[54:56] Sometimes that's what happen when uh
[55:00] when it's not exactly what you want to
[55:01] preach, but because you were studying
[55:03] it, it has a way of coming back to haunt
[55:05] you. Uh uh Matthew chapter 22. Let's go
[55:08] there quickly.
[55:10] Let's go there quickly.
[55:12] Another time when I'm speaking on it,
[55:14] you will know exactly what I'm talking
[55:15] about.
[55:22] Are we together?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Matthew 22
[55:26] uh verse 34. But when the Pharisees
[55:29] heard that he had put the Sadducees to
[55:31] silence, they were gathered together.
[55:35] Then one of them which was a lawyer
[55:38] which mean a student of the word that
[55:40] what it means a lawyer somebody that is
[55:42] a student of the word asks him a
[55:45] question tempting him and saying master
[55:48] which is the greatest commandment
[55:52] in the Lord.
[55:54] Are we together?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Now follow this. Now Jesus said unto
[55:58] him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[56:03] with all thine heart,
[56:07] and with all thy soul, and with all thy
[56:11] mind." Praise the Lord.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; The mind here will be the same as your
[56:17] spirit. The mind and the spirit, Paul
[56:21] used that
[56:24] interchangeably. Are we together? Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, love the Lord with all of your
[56:30] heart. Love the Lord with all of your
[56:33] soul. Love the Lord with all of your
[56:36] mind, all of your spirit.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:49] the
[56:54] the spirit is willing and the flesh is
[56:57] weak.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; That was a statement that came in the
[57:01] temptation of Jesus
[57:04] when he told the disciples to pray.
[57:08] And because all hell was against what
[57:12] was happening, the disciples couldn't
[57:15] even find strength to pray.
[57:18] Are we together?
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; They couldn't find strength to pray.
[57:24] Now
[57:26] the question there was that the
[57:31] why why I'm coming in here so you can
[57:32] see is that uh uh uh Jesus he's using
[57:39] this verse from from from Moses and and
[57:42] and he's trying to make us to see
[57:44] something. Love the Lord with all of
[57:46] your heart, all of your soul and all of
[57:49] your spirit.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Now, so it's in a place that when your
[57:59] flesh is weak,
[58:02] it does not change the love of God that
[58:04] is in your soul.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; When you're bothered, when when when you
[58:13] are affected, when when you are on a
[58:15] depression or you are worrying, your
[58:17] spirit is affected, you are worrying,
[58:20] you are trouble in your spirit. It do
[58:22] not change the love of God in your soul.
[58:25] Because Paul tells us in Romans chapter
[58:28] five that the love of God, Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He says the love of God is brought about
[58:36] h by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; In our soul.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; This is beautiful.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. when we look at it together here.
[58:53] So he said, "Love the Lord with all of
[58:54] your heart, all of your soul, all of
[58:56] your mind. This is the first and the
[59:00] great commmenting."
[59:05] &gt;&gt; I was studying this today, but I was
[59:06] looking at it on a different subject,
[59:09] but this is what I learned as I was as I
[59:12] was studying the scripture
[59:14] right here. This is where Jesus divided
[59:18] the ten commandments into two.
[59:22] When you read all the Mark or Luke
[59:25] account, Jesus says uh the ten
[59:27] commandment, they are just two. Love the
[59:30] Lord with all of your heart and love
[59:32] your neighbors as yourself. And when you
[59:35] look at the way the ten commandments is
[59:38] listed, the first four commandments
[59:41] have to do with loving the Lord.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; The first four commandments have to do
[59:49] not worship an engraven image. Do not do
[59:52] not bow down to them. Do not take the
[59:55] Lord your God the name of the the Lord
[59:57] your God in vain. And the fourth one is
[1:00:00] that honor the Sabbath.
[1:00:04] All of that have to do with the Lord.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; And he called that the great
[1:00:10] commandment.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; And the second he says here,
[1:00:20] "And the second is likely unto this." is
[1:00:24] likely unto this. Meaning that from the
[1:00:28] the the the fifth commandment COMING
[1:00:31] DOWN, EVERY ONE OF them are likely. They
[1:00:33] have to do with somebody. They have to
[1:00:36] do with your neighbors.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; The fifth commandment, honor your or
[1:00:42] your father and your mother. They are
[1:00:43] your neighbor. They are your closest
[1:00:45] neighbors.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; The next one, DO NOT STEAL. DO NOT BEAR
[1:00:51] FALSE WITNESS. I mean, do not steal.
[1:00:53] It's is your neighbor. Do not bear false
[1:00:55] when against your neighbor. So it has to
[1:00:57] do with people. And what I learned in
[1:01:00] this is that what I learned in this
[1:01:06] that was nothing part of this tonight
[1:01:08] but I don't know how I got there.
[1:01:11] But what I learned in this is they are
[1:01:13] there the the the the second
[1:01:16] commandment.
[1:01:18] Hallelujah.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; They are six.
[1:01:22] Four have to do with the Lord your God.
[1:01:26] The six has to do with loving your
[1:01:30] neighbors as yourself. Are we together?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Six is the number of men.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; So there are PEOPLE WITHOUT THE HOLY
[1:01:41] Ghost that can keep the rest of the six.
[1:01:46] There are people that not BORN AGAIN.
[1:01:47] THEY LOVE their parents. They honor
[1:01:50] their parents.
[1:01:53] Are we together?
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T GO TO CHURCH, BUT THEY WILL
[1:01:58] NOT STEAL from their neighbor.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; THEY WON'T BEAR FALSE WITNESS.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said they are likely
[1:02:10] like this. They are connected.
[1:02:14] They have to do with the people around
[1:02:16] you. They have to DO WITH YOUR
[1:02:18] ENVIRONMENT. WHILE THE FIRST FOUR HAVE
[1:02:21] TO do with
[1:02:23] the supernatural.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; You need God
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; to honor the first four.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; You need to be born again.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; You need a revelation to honor the
[1:02:37] Sabbath
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; HONORING THE SABBATH IS PUTTING GOD
[1:02:45] FIRST.
[1:02:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; So the word OF GOD IS SHARPER THAN THE
[1:02:56] TWO-EDGED SWORD. So when the word comes
[1:02:59] in your life, when the word is revealed
[1:03:02] to you,
[1:03:06] it goes and it divide
[1:03:10] gets to the divide in the sun of your
[1:03:13] soul and your spirit.
[1:03:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Your your soul is u is a it's a home IS
[1:03:26] IT'S A DWELLING place for the word.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; It's a dwelling place.
[1:03:38] The word gets right in there. David will
[1:03:41] say, "Restore my soul."
[1:03:45] Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; The word goes in there your soul to
[1:03:50] bring true consciousness of God to you.
[1:03:57] Are we together?
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; A person spirit can comes on an
[1:04:07] influence of the word. They can become
[1:04:09] religious but they never receive a birth
[1:04:13] in their soul.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; they are going to be religious and still
[1:04:19] have an animal nature
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; right in the face of the word of God.
[1:04:26] They can do the most craziest thing
[1:04:31] because their soul is not delivered.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:39] Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; That's why I was coming to when I say
[1:04:44] our age is a little bit different. The
[1:04:46] reason why I say that is because this
[1:04:49] age is harvest time.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; This is the age of the fullness.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; We cannot play religion under the
[1:04:59] message. We can't be religious under the
[1:05:02] message. We can't play church under the
[1:05:04] message because the word has come to
[1:05:07] deal with us face to face.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; THE WORD HAS COME TO BRING US REALITY.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And if we get serious with the word,
[1:05:20] WE'RE GOING TO KNOW OURSELF.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; WE WILL KNOW OURSELF. WE WILL UNDERSTAND
[1:05:27] OURSELF. WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THE
[1:05:30] GRACE OF GOD IS DOING. YOU WILL YOU WILL
[1:05:32] SEE THE DIVIDING the sun. You will see
[1:05:34] the grace of God dealing with your soul
[1:05:37] CHANGING YOUR LIFE. You will see THE
[1:05:39] THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO WAR WITH IN YOUR
[1:05:41] SPIRIT.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:03] So that's why I said our age is a little
[1:06:06] bit different. So the lion anointing had
[1:06:08] to warn against it. It it has to battle
[1:06:11] yet in this in these three church ages.
[1:06:13] Yeah. The deed the deed of the nickel
[1:06:16] was was introduced in this in this age
[1:06:19] here. It just started as a deed as a as
[1:06:22] a good thought good good intention.
[1:06:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:28] Good intention.
[1:06:31] And then we we just need to have some
[1:06:33] choirs. You know, everybody can sing. So
[1:06:37] let's let's just pay some people to
[1:06:39] train their voice. I mean, they would do
[1:06:41] the singing for us because when we
[1:06:43] singing, we just out of tone.
[1:06:46] Out of tone.
[1:06:49] Doesn't that sound nice?
[1:06:53] Praise the Lord. We out of tune. We
[1:06:56] can't even clap our hands straight.
[1:06:58] The musicians are playing one thing. The
[1:07:00] singers are singing another thing.
[1:07:03] Sometime I don't even know if I'm host
[1:07:05] or my voice is clear. Praise. Good idea.
[1:07:10] Good idea.
[1:07:12] And pretty soon I said, "Oh, wow. Yeah,
[1:07:15] we will pay them. We will pay them. We
[1:07:18] will pay them. They will dedicate
[1:07:19] themselves to to training, to singing,
[1:07:22] you know, uh they will do the worship.
[1:07:28] And that was not just a wound thing.
[1:07:32] They were taking away this this the
[1:07:34] liberty of the spirit from the people.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; They were bounding the people and the
[1:07:38] people never knew that. They were making
[1:07:41] them cold to just come and sit down and
[1:07:44] become spectator.
[1:07:48] And they didn't know that.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; It came in very that's a good idea.
[1:07:55] That's a good thought.
[1:07:58] Praise the Lord. Why if you go in the
[1:08:00] desert, you you you you save somebody in
[1:08:03] the desert and and there is no water for
[1:08:05] you to baptize them. What are you going
[1:08:08] to do?
[1:08:10] Well, you can just take water from your
[1:08:12] camper and just sprink it over their
[1:08:13] head. That will be easy.
[1:08:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT OPENED THE RARE SEAT
[1:08:24] AND CAUSE A PATH THROUGH THE RED SEA.
[1:08:28] Can he open the desert and pour water
[1:08:30] there?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; And won't need to be baptized.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; But you see all of those ideas,
[1:08:40] they came across slowly and the church
[1:08:42] embraced him.
[1:08:49] And as the people embraced him is is
[1:08:52] slowly drive the spirit away.
[1:08:58] And that's what Paul was dealing with in
[1:09:01] this age.
[1:09:03] When you real when you read church
[1:09:05] history, you realize that uh when Paul
[1:09:08] right there in in Rome
[1:09:15] when the Roman church because there were
[1:09:17] two churches in Rome.
[1:09:20] There were two churches in Rome there.
[1:09:21] There was there was the the Roman church
[1:09:24] and there was a small group of believers
[1:09:28] that choose to stay with the apostle
[1:09:30] teaching.
[1:09:33] Praise the Lord. The ones that were
[1:09:35] known or called to be fanatics
[1:09:41] And these other ones, they were happy
[1:09:44] because uh I mean h big men of the Roman
[1:09:48] government is now coming to their
[1:09:49] churches.
[1:09:54] Did you hear that? uh uh uh uh uh you
[1:09:57] know uh the the the the centurum from
[1:10:00] from uh uh you know uh uh
[1:10:05] where's the blessing he's he I heard he
[1:10:08] will be in church Constantine invited
[1:10:11] him
[1:10:15] praise the Lord.
[1:10:19] So now that that church that was looking
[1:10:21] like just like an old struggling church,
[1:10:24] now they have big men associated with
[1:10:26] them and and you know and and then the
[1:10:28] status go. But then the thing also is
[1:10:30] that you can't sit down beside the big
[1:10:32] men. So all of you people that are
[1:10:34] little class, y'all go back.
[1:10:37] You leave the front seat for the
[1:10:40] generous and the the big people.
[1:10:46] nicolating
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; dividing
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; and then that just how it started
[1:10:53] creeping in the church. So Paul this
[1:10:56] anointing of uh of Paul teaching how to
[1:10:59] fight against this in these three church
[1:11:03] ages.
[1:11:06] But we will learn from Revelation
[1:11:08] chapter 6 that the the the the deed got
[1:11:13] a crown.
[1:11:15] So that doctrine, trinitarian doctrine
[1:11:18] was crowned right here. And when it got
[1:11:20] a crown, IT HAS SO MUCH POWER TO DO
[1:11:24] WHAT? Move to the next edge and create
[1:11:27] death.
[1:11:31] Praise the Lord. And sometimes that is
[1:11:34] the same thing that the enemy tried to
[1:11:36] bring to us. You know, he tried to give
[1:11:38] us reason to, you know, to relax, not to
[1:11:41] just be I mean overzeilious. He He just
[1:11:44] tried to take all your little
[1:11:45] spirituality away from you and before
[1:11:48] you realize
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; you are spiritually dead.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; The thing that will move your heart uh
[1:12:00] uh WITH GOD IN PRAYER and and and and I
[1:12:04] mean when it used to be before you fell
[1:12:06] empty AND YOU FELL BACKSLIDING IN YOUR
[1:12:09] WAYS, YOU WOULD CRY to God. It's no
[1:12:12] longer there.
[1:12:17] Everything now is just reasoning in your
[1:12:19] mind.
[1:12:21] Are we together?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; When it got a crown here, it moved here
[1:12:27] and it became death. Let's go. Let's go.
[1:12:30] Go change the picture now. Go over to to
[1:12:33] our quote on the fifth seal. If you have
[1:12:36] it,
[1:12:38] let's read a little bit. I want to I
[1:12:41] want I want to pick up something.
[1:12:44] It's 9:00. I should be closing.
[1:12:48] Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; I will just read there.
[1:12:59] Okay, I'll go ahead and they will catch
[1:13:02] with us.
[1:13:05] was exactly like the church responding
[1:13:09] to the anointing and they couldn't do
[1:13:11] nothing else. Now the first was that
[1:13:15] lion that ro pure unadulterated word.
[1:13:20] The second in territorial was the ox
[1:13:23] anointing
[1:13:24] the burden a beast of burden pardon me.
[1:13:28] It it was uh also a a sacrificial beast.
[1:13:34] And wasn't that exactly the poor little
[1:13:37] church? Rome have settled down there to
[1:13:41] a thousand years of dark age and and
[1:13:44] anything that didn't profess to be a
[1:13:48] Roman church was put on death
[1:13:51] immediately.
[1:13:53] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's under the
[1:13:56] second church age.
[1:13:59] Now the third beast that went forth
[1:14:04] that went out
[1:14:06] from the devil was this black her say
[1:14:10] see and the ter beast that went out a
[1:14:14] power
[1:14:15] from God to combat him to combat the
[1:14:20] power of the black horse was a man.
[1:14:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; So we realize here the man's anointing
[1:14:28] went out. [clears throat] Okay, that's
[1:14:31] right. So the man anointing went out and
[1:14:35] uh it was cunning. It was smart with the
[1:14:39] wisdom of God. Now that's that's that
[1:14:42] just where I want to get you get you to
[1:14:44] tonight because honor the man's
[1:14:46] anointing. You see what brother Brandham
[1:14:48] say was it was smart with the wisdom of
[1:14:51] God. You know a man is is is smarter
[1:14:54] than any of the beast. See he's he is
[1:14:57] smarter because he can outweight him
[1:15:01] mostly. He's coning his troll. See now
[1:15:04] so you will realize that it was under
[1:15:07] this age that the printing press
[1:15:10] started.
[1:15:13] Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:16] It was only at this age
[1:15:21] that they started writing the Bible.
[1:15:23] They started printing the Bible. So, so
[1:15:27] honor this age
[1:15:30] these people are responding to their
[1:15:32] age.
[1:15:34] So, honor the age man gets an idea to
[1:15:38] start the printing press.
[1:15:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it looks common
[1:15:45] but it is God's way of fortifying his
[1:15:48] church.
[1:15:50] WHY? BECAUSE NOW THE BIBLE IS GOING TO
[1:15:53] BE PRINTED. THE BIBLE IS GOING TO BE
[1:15:56] DISTRIBUTE.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; DISTRIBUTED. And now the believers will
[1:16:01] have direct ACCESS TO THE WORD TO be
[1:16:04] able to stand against the Catholic
[1:16:06] doctrine.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. IF THE BIBLE WAS NOT PRINTED,
[1:16:12] THERE IS NO WAY THAT LUTHER will have
[1:16:15] come out against the Catholic Church to
[1:16:18] say the just shall live by faith
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHY? IT WAS JUST IN THE HANDS OF
[1:16:25] THE Catholic priest.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He was just telling the church and in
[1:16:30] some places he read he reads in Latin
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; when he don't even understand Latin.
[1:16:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; He taught to read in Latin but never
[1:16:42] taught to understand what he's reading.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Man, brother there in in uh in uh uh uh
[1:16:54] I think St. Louis, uh, Missouri. Uh,
[1:16:57] brother brother James Miller's son,
[1:16:59] brother Tim, they have a they have a
[1:17:01] church there and, uh, they they are
[1:17:04] beginning to to to have lot of,
[1:17:09] uh, Amish people,
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; lot of Amish people coming out of that
[1:17:16] movement. And now, why? Because they
[1:17:20] have got a hold of the Bible.
[1:17:25] Because the Bible that they are reading
[1:17:27] to them is in a old German language
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; in an old German language.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; So whatever the man reads and tell you
[1:17:38] that's what it means, that's what you
[1:17:40] believe
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; because you don't know how to read it.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. a year now. These these
[1:17:48] Amish people uh uh one of one of the the
[1:17:51] the the
[1:17:53] man and his wife came to the meeting
[1:17:55] there in enforcement uh with uh brother
[1:17:58] Prader, brother Prader meeting. They
[1:18:00] drove down with uh uh brother Millers
[1:18:03] and his family and and you know Tim was
[1:18:06] testifying to me how you know they are
[1:18:08] having Bible studies and these people
[1:18:10] are just asking question. You can just
[1:18:12] see the hunger in them. It looks like
[1:18:15] they have been stabbed all of these
[1:18:16] years
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; and now they are exposed to the Bible
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; and now they are realizing that what
[1:18:24] they've been telling them in German is
[1:18:26] alive.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; So as much as IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS A
[1:18:33] PHYSICAL thing
[1:18:35] the opening of the printing press but
[1:18:37] that was God's way that was God's power
[1:18:40] that was the beast of the age. So the
[1:18:42] men of that age was responding.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; The Lord. Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And if you were if you will have good
[1:18:52] Bible literature,
[1:18:54] if you read books
[1:18:57] of of of of people from from that time,
[1:19:00] the the 18th century, you say, "Wow."
[1:19:05] Because you you you could tell that they
[1:19:07] were touching something.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would you could tell that I
[1:19:14] mean like h
[1:19:16] Charles Lying the one that uh you know
[1:19:19] people uh uh since oh brother Brandon
[1:19:21] copy from here and and that that's the
[1:19:23] age that he came from.
[1:19:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:29] If you read your books I'm not a good
[1:19:32] reader but I have I love books.
[1:19:35] So I have I have them I have them and
[1:19:37] and and and I like when I get inside you
[1:19:40] you just see that oh my God. It was not
[1:19:44] the time for the opening of the word but
[1:19:48] those men were in the word
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; because it is God that gives revelation.
[1:19:54] You don't get revelation by learning
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; but you could tell that they were in the
[1:19:59] word.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:05] Because I mean it will bring types and
[1:20:07] shadow out for you. You will say, "Oh my
[1:20:09] god.
[1:20:11] Oh my god."
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; So I'll stop right here and uh but what
[1:20:21] where I wanted to go with this is to
[1:20:24] allow us to see that uh the man's
[1:20:27] anointing
[1:20:30] the man's anointing
[1:20:36] Let's let's drop down and read read a
[1:20:38] little bit in our close here. That age
[1:20:40] from the dark age coming out to the dark
[1:20:43] age. Now the other side
[1:20:46] when this when this black house was
[1:20:49] riding when when they charge their their
[1:20:54] sacrifices and everything they done the
[1:20:56] money and money. Oh, you know that. Now
[1:21:00] the next thing that went out to combat
[1:21:03] death was the beast with the face of a
[1:21:06] man smart, educated, true, fine,
[1:21:08] anointed with that spirit of the dead.
[1:21:11] You notice it now. He went he went to
[1:21:15] combat with the holiness of God's
[1:21:18] wisdom.
[1:21:20] So first see it was the reformer
[1:21:23] zingling. all
[1:21:27] who are not scarving and and all of
[1:21:29] those men they were all under the the
[1:21:32] the man's anointing. So you see that's
[1:21:36] the reason why when they started their
[1:21:38] movement their movement started on the
[1:21:41] base of the word but when the men died
[1:21:45] they denominated
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; and went back
[1:21:48] praise the Lord.
[1:21:50] So the man's anointing went all the way
[1:21:54] to Pentecost.
[1:21:57] The man's anointing
[1:22:00] went all the way to Pentecost. Went all
[1:22:02] the way to Laudishia.
[1:22:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; I will leave you right here tonight so
[1:22:11] when I pick it up, I'll be able to have
[1:22:14] enough comfort to pick up to go right
[1:22:16] into the ego's anointing because because
[1:22:19] you we will we will learn from the word
[1:22:22] that the eagle anointing
[1:22:24] really didn't start with uh uh uh the
[1:22:27] laudisha church age the ego's anointing
[1:22:31] started with
[1:22:34] 1963 the opening of the seal
[1:22:40] praise the Lord
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] And the reason why I I want to bring
[1:22:47] this is because this will help you to
[1:22:50] understand that uh uh all of the things
[1:22:55] that we try to major major on
[1:22:58] our dress code and and all of those
[1:23:01] things you will realize that they will
[1:23:03] all stay still under the man's
[1:23:05] anointing.
[1:23:08] Baptism in Jesus name. It was not the
[1:23:11] opening of the seals that brought it.
[1:23:13] Pentecostal were baptizing in Jesus
[1:23:16] name. Believing one God. It was not the
[1:23:19] opening of the seals that brought it.
[1:23:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:27] So you see all of these things we we try
[1:23:29] to measure on and and and we think it is
[1:23:32] the message. We think it is the message.
[1:23:35] It's all under the man's anointing.
[1:23:40] The ego's anointing comes up to SHOW YOU
[1:23:43] YOUR PLACE IN GOD.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; IT COMES TO SHOW YOU YOUR PLACE, YOUR
[1:23:50] PURPOSE, YOUR CALLING. IT HAVE TO DO
[1:23:53] WITH YOU. AMEN.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; It it does not HAVE TO DO WITH YOU UH h
[1:24:01] obeying one certain doctrine BECAUSE ALL
[1:24:05] OF THESE THINGS THAT MEN that men try to
[1:24:07] make doctrine of they were all under the
[1:24:10] men's anointing.
[1:24:12] All of these men they held to those
[1:24:14] things strongly.
[1:24:17] Praise the Lord. Even till now some very
[1:24:21] good oness
[1:24:23] Pentecostal church you get there I mean
[1:24:26] those sisters uh from up down completely
[1:24:31] the Lord decent some of our sister will
[1:24:34] even look wall
[1:24:39] praise the lord
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; so it is not in the dress code it is not
[1:24:45] in it I'm I'm I'm not playing on that
[1:24:47] I'm not saying because the revelation of
[1:24:49] the word you knowing your place in God
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; you don't need a preacher to tell you to
[1:24:54] dress this
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; right
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; you don't need a preacher
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; and and and it's because of that
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; that we have given ourself and giving a
[1:25:05] pit to people that come they just they
[1:25:08] just insult the bride
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; when the bride supposed to be showing
[1:25:12] hopeless in the word
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:25:20] When brother Randon was honored the gift
[1:25:22] of an evangelist, he was out in the
[1:25:25] denomination
[1:25:28] calling calling the bride out.
[1:25:32] But where where is our evangelist?
[1:25:35] They are in they are in the bride. How
[1:25:38] can you evangelize the bride?
[1:25:41] How can you evangelize the bride?
[1:25:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; No, the bride don't need to be
[1:25:49] evangelized. The bride needs to be shown
[1:25:52] her position.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:58] So in many in many sense in a very broad
[1:26:01] way we have gifts that are out OF PLACE
[1:26:04] BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE the as
[1:26:07] the people are shown their position. If
[1:26:10] uh if if an evangelist comes he has a
[1:26:13] gift and his gift is to rebuke sin. HIS
[1:26:17] GIFT IS TO CALL THE PEOPLE out but not
[1:26:20] in the pride.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So what is what is what what is what
[1:26:27] WHAT WHAT IS GOING TO happen is that he
[1:26:29] takes the pulpit. Now I'm not I'm not
[1:26:32] casting down on evangelism. No, you know
[1:26:34] we bring preachers through. I'm just
[1:26:36] trying to tell you
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; where we are.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Because a brother could come and he's
[1:26:46] anointed, he has a message, he can come
[1:26:48] and preach and before you realize you
[1:26:50] start looking for something in your life
[1:26:52] that is not there.
[1:26:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Because that gift is rebuking sin. Is
[1:27:02] telling you clean your life. Is telling
[1:27:03] you check your life and then you goes
[1:27:05] back again when when actually you're
[1:27:07] supposed to be going forward.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:16] Remember
[1:27:20] brother Brandham says when a bride find
[1:27:23] her place [snorts]
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; the rapture we go.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] And that's the reason why when you watch
[1:27:31] many of the brothers, I've watched them,
[1:27:34] brother Dale Smith, brother brother
[1:27:36] Daryl Ward and many many many
[1:27:39] evangelists they comes to the pulpit
[1:27:42] they preach even like brother brother
[1:27:45] forest farmer that came and preached for
[1:27:47] us.
[1:27:48] You're listening to that message does
[1:27:50] not even looks like an evangelist
[1:27:51] preaching.
[1:27:54] Why? because their gift is responding to
[1:27:58] our position.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; When the church is in the word, when the
[1:28:03] church is desiring to go higher, you
[1:28:06] create the demand WHAT THE PREACHER MUST
[1:28:08] PREACH.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; The preacher can come with his message.
[1:28:13] I'm going to blast this. You demand.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; It's just like you go you go over to the
[1:28:21] restaurant to eat. I DON'T FORCE you to
[1:28:23] eat to say look this is what I have. You
[1:28:25] have to eat it.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; No, you tell me what you want to eat.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; It is MY DUTY TO GET BEHIND THERE and
[1:28:31] visit.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Or else you say I I leave from here.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; I don't tell you say it's old meal we
[1:28:38] have for dinner.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; The old meal we have.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; You say I want steak. I say it's old
[1:28:44] meal that we have.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Sit down and eat the old meal.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's the way we preachers we
[1:28:55] are.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; When the WHEN WHEN THE DESIRE in the
[1:28:59] people is to go up higher.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Then we say, "Let's come to fast and
[1:29:05] pray. LET'S FAST AND PRAY. LET FAST AND
[1:29:08] PRAY."
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; NOW, be careful. I'm not
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not kicking those things out of the
[1:29:16] church,
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; but it is you
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; that create the demand.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; It is your position
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; where you are in your walk with God.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; so the bride is responding to her
[1:29:33] anointing
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; and she cannot do anything else. Amen.
[1:29:36] Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing when this
[1:29:38] church is anointed with people that are
[1:29:41] praying and reading the word.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Any preacher that comes behind here,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; he will have to respond to our
[1:29:47] anointing.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; You see the picture?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and pray.
[1:30:09] Dear father, we just want to thank you
[1:30:12] tonight, Lord.
[1:30:14] Thought that Lord God, we must labor on
[1:30:16] this a little bit just to be able to
[1:30:19] help your people to grab the picture.
[1:30:21] Like I said, not being a teacher Lord,
[1:30:25] Father, I take these things into
[1:30:26] preaching, but Father God, uh, uh,
[1:30:29] coming over it and the second time and
[1:30:32] the third time, the people might grab
[1:30:34] it. It might get clearer today, Father.
[1:30:37] It might get clearer today. Brother
[1:30:39] Brandham told us, it's not the preacher
[1:30:41] that brings the revival to time. He said
[1:30:44] it's the people.
[1:30:46] He said it's the people that has the
[1:30:47] revival. So many times we have
[1:30:50] preachers, they come and preach, you
[1:30:52] say, "Oh, wow. I enjoyed that. I enjoyed
[1:30:55] the brother." Yeah. We enjoy him because
[1:30:57] he yielded to the Holy Ghost. But you
[1:31:00] are the one that create the atmosphere.
[1:31:04] You are the one that has the anointing.
[1:31:08] And [music] that's the reason why when
[1:31:09] we come to church, we are down. We are
[1:31:12] we are distracted [music] and and and uh
[1:31:15] we are not prayed up and we not ready
[1:31:17] for the word. We are now worshiping.
[1:31:22] You are dictating [music] how the
[1:31:23] service must go.
[1:31:30] Heavenly Father,
[1:31:33] precious Lord, we we just pray to God,
[1:31:35] Father Lord, as we say over over and
[1:31:39] over, Father God, Lord, we we want to
[1:31:41] labor for the atmosphere that work in
[1:31:43] this place where we come together.
[1:31:45] Father, Lord, we have our little
[1:31:47] children that needs the Holy Ghost. We
[1:31:49] have our young people that are dealing
[1:31:51] with peer pressure, Father God, and
[1:31:53] different things. Lord, we want to labor
[1:31:56] for the right atmosphere, [music] Lord.
[1:32:00] We want to come to service with a ready
[1:32:02] mind. We want to come to service and
[1:32:05] say, "Lord,
[1:32:06] lift me up.
[1:32:09] I want to be [music] lifted up on higher
[1:32:10] ground.
[1:32:16] Not just only waiting for what the
[1:32:18] preacher will bring, but we want to come
[1:32:20] with our heart tonight. I really want to
[1:32:23] be fed.
[1:32:25] I want the word to be preached where I
[1:32:26] can I can draw some faith from the word.
[1:32:34] We love [music] you tonight. We thank
[1:32:35] you for what your grace is doing, Lord.
[1:32:37] Father, in our midst,
[1:32:39] Father Lord, I pray you take your people
[1:32:41] home safely [music] tonight. We thank
[1:32:44] you. We love you, Father.
[1:32:47] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

[1:32:54] there tonight.
