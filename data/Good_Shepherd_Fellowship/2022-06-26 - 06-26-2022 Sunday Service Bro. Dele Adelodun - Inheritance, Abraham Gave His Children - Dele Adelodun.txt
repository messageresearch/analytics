service next weekend with brother clay farmer uh saturday and sunday morning so let's come prepared and also our july 4 gathering that brother jordan set up on july 4th i hope you got the flyer and you find the location he will be there a bit earlier to get the place ready but he he will be expecting us to be there by noon uh uh 12 noon would be a good time to arrive and uh bring your food to sheard and and also come hungry to eat amen bring food to shed and come hungry to eat so we are all uh most welcome next weekend july 4th for monday and let's come together and just have some time of fellowship but the services are saturday night and and sunday morning saturday night at uh 7 p.m let's uh let's come together and just thank the lord praise the lord amen and uh you know i've been i've been thinking about uh the wonderful service we had last weekend we brought the brother ben good singing good preaching but you know as as it is always when the evangelists come and go then the pastor has to stay around in and and do the rest of the work amen praise the lord brother brother uh ben preach on uh you know when he says i was coming to stretch grace a little bit i was sitting there i was thinking in my mind i said you know every time when grace is stretched if you don't have a good hold on christ you fall the lord every time when you know when a preacher is is uh is trying to to uh uh you know speak on the word it's not like like he said he was not indulging things he was just trying to help us look look another way amen look at this in another way look at a broader picture praise the lord because the most principle thing is that i don't care what you practice to do what you love to do and what you don't love to do if you don't get ahold of christ as your personal experience [Music] what you love to do and what you don't love to do is not going to be any benefit to you because we love to do one thing and then pretty soon we don't love it anymore we don't like certain things and then pretty soon well i changed my mind i like it but if you don't get a hold of christ if you have not got to that place to have a birth and experience with christ praise the lord amen but uh uh as we as we stay together and we travel together we pray that the lord will be able to help us amen praise the lord because uh uh as a preacher it's very easy for me to ask your pastor it's easy for me to pick up the reformation amen you know i can pick up the reformation as soon as i start to see reformation i can pick it up but we don't have a message of reformation we have a message of restoration amen the message has not come to reform us it come to take us back to the faith of the apostolic fathers praise the lord but uh i'm not preaching this morning so you can relax amen amen but don't be too comfortable praise the lord uh our friend and uh and brother brother dele is preaching for us this morning praise the lord very good friend of mine we have uh traveled a lot and had the privilege to to learn a whole lot from him we have slept on the bed together slept on the floor together slept in the car together slept in the plane together [Laughter] praise the lord amen so we we have we have traveled together being been good friend good friend and he's around to to visit his uh we'll be traveling out to [Music] tucson for some meetings during the july 4 weekend so we were able to have him coming and uh and speak for us today so uh uh let's just uh prepare ourselves and let's just fellowship around the world amen praise the lord let's fellowship around the world let's stand on our feet and uh let's sing their song it is grace to serve the lord it is grace it is grace to save the lord [Music] praise the lord it is grace to save the lord amen it is great it is grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] it is [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] oh yes it is [Music] it is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] may we please bow our heads for a word of prayer [Music] our most gracious eternal father we want to return thanksgiving unto you this morning for the gift of our lives the gift of a new day and a gift of a new week we thank you for your mercy that was our portion since the time we fellowship together the last time we thank you for keeping your church and keeping each and everyone in our individual corner many waters have passed under the bridge storms have risen clouds are falling but you're messy endurance and by this message we were not consumed we are grateful again that we

we appreciate you almighty father may you accept our worship this morning as a sweet smelling server oh god receive the worship of your children even we pray that you will accept our person let there be nothing between our soul and the savior dear jesus may the blood that speaketh better things than those of abel speak on our behalf this morning come by lord jesus move through this audience but don't pass no one by may you stop at the post of each person father discern their needs and grant you them the substance of their requests and their desires to each heavenly father and we are asking that you will break the bread of life in your own manner when you did on the road to her my house it gave illumination to thy people may the eyes of understanding be illuminated again this morning and lord that we might become light-footed with the wilt of the world cast out with burdens ruled away with demons dealt with by the preaching of your word so that we become light to go and declare the testimony that indeed you are alive let that be our experience if the episodes that are coming on their way may you guide their part here civilian if there be those still in their houses may you give them a quickening we that are here may you prepare our hearts bless other places where believers are fellowshipping and visit us in a special way here bless your servant the pastor continue to increase your grace your strength your unction in his life more wisdom oh god and more revelation that he might be able to tender the flock of your people bless his family also bless the rest of the ministries and the offices that are here keep them who god may jesus bless every family you said you will build your church and the gate of it will never prevail may you confirm that more and more in the life of this assembly the service we have today make it a blessing one to another that at the end of it all our coffers will be filled and we shall be thankful granted to us father as we commit the atmosphere this time and ourselves and your watch into your care in the name of the lord jesus christ amen the lord bless you sins the lord bless you it feels good to be in your midst this morning but i would not want to keep you standing well so just read the bible but you now take the comfort of your seat after we can get acquainted and that is for those who don't know me and that we go to the preaching of the world but i want you to know that i'm very happy to be in your midst if you have your bibles with you please turn with me to genesis chapter 22. we are going to read the first 18 verses and i think sometimes whites to read the bible first so you can get used to my to my african ways you get used to my accent that way and it becomes easy all right genesis chapter 22 from verse 1 to 18 if you are there say amen and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and gather into the land of moria and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went on to the place of which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off abraham said unto his young men a body here with the hearts and i and the lord will go yonder and worship and come again to you and abram took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spoke unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamp for a pond offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a bunch of friends so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him off and abram built and halter there and laid the wood in order and banned isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood abram stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the lord called on to him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thy end upon the lord neither do thou anything unto him but now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abram lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there behind him a ram caught in the thickage by his arms and abram went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abram called the name of that place jehovah jaire as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called on to abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself a vice one say the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not retelled thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sun which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seat shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word god bless you may please be seated i'd like to reach all the saints this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ amen i thank the lord for making it possible for me again to be in the united states and in particular here in minnesota amen it's been quite a while and i can see that the lord has been so good to the church we've had some expansions and the lord will continue to expand his grace in our lives amen i want to thank our dear pastor here for his continued support and the extension i think i have um i call it standing order extension of arm of service amen i want to thank him very much may the lord bless him like he told you people we've come a very long way and we thank god he's still keeping us in the faith doing the only thing we know to do which is the preaching of the gospel and i'm thankful to god for that may the lord bless you sir may the lord bless your wife the family and every one of you it's nice seeing you again i thank god for brother steve amen it's been true things since the last time i came but god has kept him that i could see him again the lord bless you so it's a good friend amen it was pleasant to the lord to take my first landlord in minnesota away yeah my first landlord and friend brother scott but it is fine the lord knows all about it the good thing is that he's not lost these people will say we lost somebody we didn't we can lose a believer we don't lose a believer and a believer doesn't die they only sleep if a man dies he can't wake up again but brother scott will wake up because he's only sleeping and the language of heaven in the language of eternity there is no death that was when christ was announcing the passage of brother lazarus is that lazarus left i hope you realize that but because it was dealing with earthly men who do not understand their only language he had to condescend to their level and say i mean okay let me speak you guys language i mean he died then he said let's go and die with him [Music] so but because we are restored back we we live on the earth but we don't belong here if you are if you are earthly the bible said in the book of revelations to have woe to you read it very well it's a woe to the inhabitants of the earth because the cast out devil is going to at least tear on you but it then he said rejoice he that live in the heavens so we are the ones who live in the heavens because we live in heavenly places in christ jesus far above the realm where the devil himself operates so we are more than conquerors so may the lord bless them i've had cause to speak with uh sister naomi and i thank god the family is doing very well amen god bless you all i'm so happy to see you i saw sister tata last as a as a spinster i guess that's a husband by our side because the de facto father is here now right congratulations my brother congratulations sister happy to see you together amen and by the way the peter since i almost couldn't recognize him again looks like americans lose good on this brother here outside of the pastor they are the only ones who know my house they are the only ones who have visited me in nigeria so all of you claim to be my friend and you don't know where i live these are my true friends here god bless you nice to see you all again amen where's everybody sister are you there wonderful the lord bless you amen she is one of my caretakers those times and ah way way way back there that's my sister there god bless you society god bless you thank you very much and then of course the brother wesley and the ever smiling sister wesley sister wesley is a sister in whom there is no guy she welcomes you with the smile anytime any day she's just a happy mama and by the way we are sister cassidy she's old oh she couldn't come all right the lord bless her that's the one who doesn't want to come to africa at all [Music] those times she will ask me i have not left she's asking me when i'm returning then i say okay albert when are you seeing me in nigeria i said no no no no no i don't want to come so you come here all right we are back here again and we thank the lord i bring the greetings of the saints back home my dad was with you some time back he also asked me to greet you all very much and so did my wife and the all the members of our house they are doing very well and i'm sure they'll be glad to know that the scenes are fine here yesterday i saw pastor jim yamiche i don't know if he's been this way before okay he requested that i greet all of you with pastor frambook i went to new jersey i took my flight from new york so we had a small gathering that made us see before i took off so they are doing very well the lord bless you all amen so this morning if the lord will be our help which i trust he will i want to speak on the inheritance abraham gave his children the inheritance he gave his children amen if you look at the bible the bible talked about the three seed lines of abraham the first being from haggai ishmael the second being from sarah isaac and the third from keturah six sons and the bible said when abram was to leave he called these terrorist lines and he gave gifts unto ishmael and he gave gift unto the sons of keturah but unto isaac he gave his all amen and they promised he said in isaac shall thy seed be called now the silt that was called out in isaac was necessary so that those who do not have the blood dna of abraham could also be accounted as abraham children because we became the seed of abraham or the children of abraham by the capital s seed that was called through the line of isaac so isaac only represented the shadow of that perfect seat that will come and it is only by him that you and i could become the children of abraham and you will ask me this morning why is it or why was it or why would it ever be necessary to be a child of abraham you cannot be blessed outside of being a seed or a child of abraham because every blessing that could come a man's way will come by abraham just follow me sometimes i'm a slow starter but i get to where i'm going all right so every blessing that we'll get will come by abraham there were two people in the bible that were very remarkable character one was adam and the other was abraham god used these two people to define redemption to mankind in abraham he gave us what we call conditional covenant that a man can only get an attention from god or a blessing from god or a reward from god if he put in something so it became a contract that has the two parties very active if you do this i will do this but then we find out that god has no problem with keeping his own side of the bargain for human being always has problem there isn't it in a man to keep his own side all the time and it makes the old contract a mess i'm using contemporary language because i've got the young friends here oh i want them to catch it so it makes the old contract between god and man a mess then when that contract failed what god did was to start another contract with another person this time around he called this man he might not have even had a very great spiritual background because this morning your background notwithstanding is not a disadvantage whether you are raised from a christian home or you are not raised from a christian home if you are a seed of god it is not a disadvantage but it becomes a greater blessing if you have godly parents are you following me so god called abraham from the land of all of the childish the childish we are not meant to were not known to be people who served god or who knew how to serve god in the right way they acknowledged the existence of god but they approached god true idols so abram could at best be an idol worshiper with god in mind but it didn't matter to god because god wasn't looking at face he was looking at his own deposit amen some people were born empty and some people were born full the one who was born empty couldn't do anything about it and the one that was born full never did something about it it was purely work of election it was just the work of god's grace that is why when believers understood understand that aspect their daily living is a life of gratitude nobody will beg them to serve the lord when they come into god's presence nobody will beg them to sing they know they have to do it they've got to show something as an appreciation to the one who taught it feet to account them as an elect i will show mercy on uma with your mercy compassion and woman will have compassion and we make some vessels of honor and some vessels to dishonor and guess what the same material are you catching it the same material which use the mixed ceramic plates that's the one they use to make your what you call it the wc system and you don't carry the you can use the wc system to drink water to it but you can use the plates from the same porcelain material and use it to decorate your table or use it to serve yourself same material different uses now the one used in the restroom cannot protest and say why did my manufacturer made me dust the one used in the room cannot protest why am i made doors and apostle paul said if we could ask god why did you make it this way do you know the answer i gave my free will just the way i want it so it's a privilege to be on the right your side on the right side of his free will so if you understand that you won't be begged to serve the lord amen you won't feel a sense of entitlement whether i serve him or not you will feel a sense of daily obligation [Music] let me tell you if one million people are missing today it didn't change god from being god when he created when he brought creation he created only one person and from this one person he got another one person so let's say he let's even say true but today by statistics they told us that the world is seven billion people not counting those who have died and so forth still seven billion people seven billion people out of just two people so if one million is lost today it wouldn't change anything to god so if 1 billion says we are not going to serve god it still wouldn't move god if god chooses to wipe out 5 billion today by himself it will not reduce him are you catching what i'm saying so if god gives you attention it's a privilege nobody will be too sophisticated not to be able to serve the lord you love him i have not started i'm just living background so you know it's going to be one service so god decided that through this man abraham i will do what i will start the contract again because the contract of redemption or the program of redemption wasn't an afterthought in god's mind before there was a time when it was all eternity god decided that there will be a redemption when nothing was out of place so if we run our thoughts back to eternity god said there will be salvation when nothing was lost he said there will be healing when nothing was sick there will be deliverance when nothing was in bondage so whatever is happening today is not an afterthought or an accident god adequately provided and prepared for everything and this is what makes him god he's got to be in charge of everything if nothing ever gets out of cater and god loses control it wouldn't be better than me are you catching it so that adam felt in his project god knew about it if you can take it god actually caused it by himself that is bones for those who can crack bones yeah god caused it by himself because look at it this way we all see this light isn't it we enjoy the light but do you know you can enjoy something without appreciating its value [Music] you agree with me the only way to appreciate the value of light is when light is absent and you have to grow up in darkness maybe you eat your leg on the chair and you have some bruises you say oh is this how important light is it's because i couldn't see that's why i'm getting wounds [Music] now when that light is restored you will look at this light differently from that moment so even though you've been enjoying it all your life it was at the moment you had an opposite of it that you begin to put value to it if you agree with that let's bring it home to the spirit people can serve god and yet do not know the value of god when you don't appreciate god's value your sense of service the quality of it will not be asked when you are coming from a sense of appreciation so god wanted a service that has got some real value to it he doesn't just want people who will sing only only a wanted people who they are singing of praise to god will come from an understanding of where they are coming from are you getting it if you could say once i was lost but now i'm found i was bound but now i'm free when it wasn't bound it was free but it didn't appreciate freedom until it got into bondage when he wasn't sick it was healthy but he did not appreciate good earth until he became sick so god wanted worshipper with a sense of appreciation and that was why he decided to twist things by himself let me tell you there is nothing satan could have done if god did not make him do it that was why the language of the prophet he said and when satan has brought to pass that which was necessary to the purpose of god so satan is a useful agent help me tell him very well that at the end of this journey in life if we discover that god was only using him he would dump him like a trash do you know that if you are a seed of god there is no amount of satan's activity in your life that can send you to hell but will it play a role god has designed that it must play a role in order to bring you to perfection are you catching it so this was why i wanted to look at abraham closely when god decided he said i will rewrite the program with this guy and by abraham i will bring people to the understanding of the concept of redemption that's right in order to make sure that this program does not fail god became the author and the finisher of the entire thing all he wanted from abraham is a buy-in agree whatever it will take to finish the business i will supply so it's not going to be what abram will do it's going to be what god will entirely do but the part of abraham in it is that accept yes so when god called him he said let's start but before we start i realized the failure in the previous one so this time around i don't want this one to fail so i'm going to make an adequate provision for all the failures that could come to it in advance you can't beat god so when he started the program it said abraham god and abraham started talking around genesis 15 12. then in genesis 15 he said let us seal the covenant in a way that it will be so tight not even your failure abraham will tamper with this if satan cannot stop god from doing what he wants to do he tries to put god in a situation that he will not be able to do what he should do and what it does by that is to attack the person to whom promises are sent to put you in a situation that you become impossible to keep his word if he doesn't want to break his own words but god is smarter than the devil so what god did as they said abraham i'm going to do something in a way you will understand this contract we are entering into is going to be still tight nothing will tamper with it i have made up my mind to do what i need to do and there is nothing that will stop it so to guarantee that it should be done let's enter into a covenant and god was willing to condescend to enter into an agreement with abraham in a manner abram will understand in the land where abram was if they want to make a covenant tight both parties will come into the midst of their sacrifice you know according to their level of wealth if it's a goat if it's a sheep a lamb or a big bull or cow they get it and divide it into two the two parties will enter into the agreement and they will give their wage and put themselves on that curse that if any of us betray this covenant let our life be ripped apart like these animals and that becomes a binding contract now god told abraham to do that abraham was familiar with that that was the custom of his land but in other to secure abraham god said when you are bringing those articles add two more things for me now that was strange to abraham but that was the only way god could seal it tight when you are coming bring a total dove and a pigeon the prophet said wherever you see those two items in the old testament sacrifice it stands for atonement and healing so god was atoning in advance for everything abraham could do that could make it unnecessary to keep the world i'm saying it with all sense of responsibility you can coach me god was given an advanced atonement because the lord who was entering into the conduct with abraham knew abram was mortal the bible said he knoweth our friend he knows that we are mortals he will not always charge nor keep his anger forever he knew it in advance that abraham will backslide and go to egypt and there deny his wife he knew he will do it he knew everything abraham was going to do he knew abraham was going to laugh to his face in disbelief and a new sailor was going to smile within herself and think very hard can distance be so and all those doubts and expression of unbelief they are capable of stopping god from keeping his word so he wanted to atone for them in advance amen if that is strange to you let me ask you a question when was the lamb slain that's right really so the lamb was laying for a sinner that did not exist so why was why was why was god slain a lamp yes when there was nobody to atone for when nobody has done anything wrong because they knew you will come and have your failures you were given pardon for what you have not committed yes because god knew you will come and have your failures if you can understand these things to accept your forgiveness and receive the holy ghost is very easy there were two characters in the bible that did something that looked very similar it was said that judas iscariot betrayed christ still true but there was a peter who denied christ one betrayed him forcefully revealed that this is the one you should arrest one denied the person i don't even know him similar offense but do you know christ knew about that both of them was going to do this did he not preach about it even to their face yes that's right it didn't stop them from doing it [Music] he preached about it they talked about it so they are doing it was not accidental and god wasn't going to stop them from doing it but look at what god did god bless you there are spiritual people here he looked at peter is that satan has desired to sift you is that but i have prayed for you what was it offering peter advanced atonement peter hasn't done what christ said he would do yet and they are taking care of it for him but for the other guy it was like good riddance to bad rubbish the prophet said god is not obligated to king's children he has no responsibility for serpent seeds his soul responsibility is for his own elect he didn't pray for judas but he prayed for peter so what did he offer peter before you did it i've taken care of it i won't stop you from doing it you will do it but i've provided for you in advance so when peter eventually did it what he needed to do is to accept what was provided for his partner for his forgiveness am i preaching your bible god bless you so he put in there the total dove and the pigeon to stand for two things atonement for everything that abram will do and sarah along that line so that when satan raises an accusation to make it impossible for god not to keep his promise god will point the devil to the atonement holy we just tell him he's one line i've taken care of it amen and that's it are you with me since all right then the reason for the other animal the pigeon is to guarantee health because if god leaves you with a promise he must keep you in a shape to enjoy every article of that promise so no matter how hot abram and sarah got hallelujah the promise will be kept they will never be too old not to enjoy their promise so even if it ceases to be with them according to the manner of women by that offering there will be a reversal and that was why when the promise was ripe to come to pass god asked to reverse nature [Music] he turned abraham back to a young man and sent her back to a young woman [Applause] sarah became so young and yet an 89 year old woman until a 45-year-old king wanted her above all other ladies he wasn't seeing old age he was seen as sweet 16. [Music] that was the power of genesis 15 confidence didn't god promised us eternal youth [Music] didn't god say missing limbs will be restored [Music] if you have a broad kidney you can get a new one they are all the blessings of the almighty god they are in the covenant and it is part of the inheritance [Music] that abraham has given unto you [Music] you love him this morning so in that first verse when the scripture said and after these things those were the things that were taking place now the bible went further to say after these things it came to pass that god tempt abraham can you put that verse one for me please god tempt abraham now that is an unusual activity to ascribe to god this is good i can be looking here while you are looking here very nice i know you won't do less it's a technology gadget it's a me i'm an old school and it came to pass after these things those were the things that we just talked about that god did tempt abraham i'm saying that activity of tempting does not look like what should be ascribed to god yeah you know why the bible said also somewhere i said god does not tempt any man so here we are feeding the critics now because there were some people who wrote 1500 inconsistencies or what do they call it in the bible this is one of the items they said they said god tempt then in another place in the new testament it said god does not tempt say why is the bible such a confusion the confusion is in their mind [Music] the revelation is in our hearts if you do not recognize your dna's message your eyes will not be anointed with the eye self to catch the revelation of the world yes it was just as they said in my father's house there are many mansions that you begin to wonder house has many mansions what is us what is mentioned they all translate us because of want of better language or better words and vocabularies they use the best they know that was why and that is why we depend on the prophet to give us expansion when he came he told us how's in the old english means kingdom so it makes sense when you say in my father's kingdom there are many mansions you say now you connected with it very fast and that is the truth yes when you go to revelations chapter 6 he was talking about uh the beasts the beast and he was using the word beast to describe the character of god he called one the beast with the eye of a liar with the eye with the face of an ox with the face of a man and with the face of an ego now the prophet said the use of the word beast is derogatory to the character of god amen so he went back again and trace it to the original origin translation and he realized that it should have been called living creatures instead of using beasts so this is what is playing out in here now this should have been and it came to pass after distance that god did test because god can test amen but god does not tempt amen amen when i show you the meaning of the truth then you can ascribe appropriatives to whoever you think you hold it when you attempt even by dictionary meaning you tempt with a mind of deception to throw that person into trouble into a wrong thing will that be god's nature why will god want to make you do something bad he doesn't do it so tempting does not go with a pure mind tempting goes within pure intentions god is holy there is no impurity in him but you know testing goes with a positive mind if you go to shop and maybe you want to buy any of this after you purchase or you're about to purchase what would you say he said let us test it to be sure it is but if you have to attempt it is to make sure it's not working and if it is working is to destroy its workability [Music] are you getting the difference that doesn't look like god amen but you go to testing with a positive mind we want to be sure it's working when you do an exam when they test you in school is for the purpose of promoting you upgrading you isn't it so testing is to vindicate that you are a child of god but tempting is to make you doubt your sonship [Music] so it is still true that god doesn't tempt any man so god tested abraham and and said unto him abraham and he said dude here i am and he said take thy son not just thy son thine only son whom thou lovest now here is another thing they find as a contradiction they said does the scripture or god forgot that abraham has gotten a child before isaac why would they ascribe inconsistency to god and say take thy son dying only son that's number two another one out of 1500. and when the critics are brandishing this they would think they have a point and truly if you look at it with a literal sense this statement we're looking correct you know why ishmael already exists it is said the prophet said isaac was probably about 18 years old at this time is that right now ishmael was at least 13 12 or 13 years old older than isaac so if you had let's say 13 plus 18 that's 31 how can the 31 year old man be forgotten that is existing i think it's old enough to be conspicuous for everybody to see that he exists but the lord who cannot forget come back here and say abraham take thy son thine only if this was a slip of tongue go through that passage you will see this thing mentioned additional two times so it shows that god was saying very literally it shows that god meant what he was saying it shows that it wasn't a slip of tongue then what kind of a message is a person two messages as far as god is concerned anything that is nothing is covenant does not get his attention amen you will realize that ishmael wasn't a product of god's promise it was an attempt of a man trying to help god to bring his watch to pass till this very morning or afternoon god does not need your help he's capable of bringing his water to pass all he needs from you is only belief all things are possible anytime you take the matter upon yourself to bring it to pass you must fail [Music] sarah said you know what i had he said i was relying on hold women tail it's a a hedge that if it's possible if this girl give birth and she delivered on my knees and i try to nose the baby it will condition me to also bring my own baby that was what she heard but that wasn't what god said so she acted on what she heard but by the time what she had became my church even sarah self could not handle it so ishmael was not a product of the promise so as far as god is concerned it does not exist that is one side and believers you need to start rising up to only pay your attention to god's promises there are so many things that will be distracting on the left and on the right god does not know they exist and believers must also not acknowledge the existence anything that will suffocate the promises of god in your life throw it out the door keep your eye on the promise all may fail but jesus can never fail [Music] that is one side another way to look at it very correctly is this if you watch very well here the man that god was talking to here was abraham the man who gave birth to ishmael was abraham [Music] there's a difference between abram and abraham abraham means i father abraham means father of many nations it goes to show to you that your whole life if truly repented and forsaken yes does not attract a value to god amen once those things are thrown into a sea of god forgetfulness not even the anointing and the power of discernment can bring it up if any man be in christ he is a new creator all things and god meant every statement of that all things have passed away all has become new whatever abraham did as abraham was gone brother gone so gone [Music] so abram was the father of ishmael abraham was the father of isaac so as far as god is concerned at this junction of engagement abraham has only one son if you ask him but there's an ishmael he will ask you the spelling of the name of the father of israel [Music] do you know do you know this is the only way to understand true justification the prophet said when you are born because of the nature of our birth i've got very my very very young friends here so i will step up my language i don't want to get them to have a wrong impression but you see the natural at birth the way we were born the way we are conceived was not god's own prescription it was the devil who offered us god allowed it but i did not accept it yes and it was because they refused to accept it that puts a demand a compulsory demand on you to be born again if your first best was okay god will not ask you to be born again and he didn't make it an option he said you must if you are not born again this morning you must we must be born again amen [Applause] [Music] god bless you you must be born again it is compulsory essential necessary that you receive the holy ghost because we doubt it you cannot make it [Applause] again [Applause] it is not an option it is not an option i think we don't tell our children enough again so i want to tell them you must be born again ella says god bless you you must be born you agree with me god bless you ah she's smiling on there you must amen where are they my bro you must be born god bless you and the lord will do it yes we will not leave anyone behind [Music] exodus negotiation has always been we will go with all you agree with me sir that's right pharaoh is it pharaoh of this day or of any day they are always interested in the younger generation what will make a man a king to say who are the people that want to go we say i want to go and worship god are you asking me who are the people do you expect me to leave my family behind amen you shouldn't have that question wasn't necessary pharaoh was asking moses who are the people to go okay if you care to know the people to go all of us including our children including our cows including our animals even our pet god will go with us everything we have we will make it available to god we are the generation that believe in the promise we live on the lord and doubt [Applause] [Music] because it's working for us we know it will work for them but guys come you can't give what you don't have [Music] i'm coming to you parents gradually and we are still in 20 kilometers 20 miles praise the lord you love him so when you were born naturally you were born with a nature imposed upon you because the prescription of our birth has its own nature the introducer of that beth created that system in order to be able to inject his nature into mankind so even though serpent was used the seeds that came out of serpent was not serpent's own seed it was the seed of satan by serpent because satan is a spirit but he wanted a child he wanted a son so he infused himself into a creature and through that create your past is sick that was why the bible said cain was of the evil one you can study god's genealogy in the bible you can study adam's genealogy in the bible ken was absent yes you said but so was said so what's abel you didn't look well look at it this way candy didn't die ken started having generations so it should have been hear them talking been the first one is that right but now ken was missing abel couldn't have been there because if you say adam begat abel then before abel could begot anything he died that means the end of the generation had come but there was a berlin there amen because when if at seth he said god has appointed me another seed instead of ever so seth was able figuratively in the son of abel who came slew and the bible said and adam begat saith who was like a third born so by the love of birthright it shouldn't even form the genealogy it should have been king if truly cain was the son of adam but it was seth that took the place and from search you begin to see a generation that started calling on the name of the lord because they came from god [Applause] now to this generation because they also came by that system a nature was imposed on them but what makes them the generation of god is that inside was a siege gem of election that was laying flatly dormant waiting for its appointed time of quickening the prophet of god said that seed he call it some places your soul he said that one is your real you he said that what exactly to be you if you have not come under the punk of natural breath that is how you would have come are you getting it but all up is not lost because you will be coming shortly many of you are here right now are you following me so when you came the nature of the natural birth took over your identity and start projecting itself that wasn't you so you started doing things that we mean that we are evil that we're immoral there with this and that but all along while you are doing that something caught you at once in the world then one day god spoke to the seed in you this is your new birth that's it in you cannot be born natural it can only be burned by spoken word so at some point he must hear spoken word the message of your day and when he had it he took the seat and you begin to hunger for things that are spiritual you begin to hunger for god you begin to feel ashamed of the life you once boasted about before you begin to feel condemned of the things you want glory in before and you gave it a chance because when that seed is ready it will take a hold of you there is nothing you can do about it you came to a point you surrender you surrender to the struggle of the new birth and when you surrender paul look at you my children in whom i travel until christ be formed in you then you came to the house of the lord you repented and something in your heart tells you you must forsake not just repenting forsake it and because god saw that in your heart the readiness he gave you the holy ghost and the holy ghost change your appetite [Music] then you can tell the life are now living is no longer me but christ is born of god does not commit sin because the seed of god abideth in him it was such a change you begin to hunger and thus after righteousness and gradually the things you once find difficult you start throwing them away the more they go the more god takes occupation christ is reformed and expanded and expanding until one day you stood up i said guess what the life i now leave it's no longer but christ doing his work [Music] now when that seed became quickened it's still the same body but a different life [Music] your old you died that was jacob he died israel came up is it right to hold israel responsible for what jacob did that is your true justification that is why the prophet said it is as though you never did it and evil said in fact you will never do this my identity was borrowed you have a right to suit the devil for identity theft he borrowed your identity to do evil you go back yourself you came to the realization of who you are and from that moment it took a new song for you this is exactly what was happening here no more abraham it became abraham so whatever has happened in abraham let the past go behind [Music] looking forward towards the mark of the high calling my son deli becomes i'm pressing on the opposite new eyes i'm getting every day still praying as i'm homeward bound lord plant my feet on higher girl you love him so this is why god can tell him and say take thy son the only son to do what by the way this is the son upon whom the fulfillment of every promise rested open so god is now asking the man to go and destroy yes to destroy the object of the promise if the object of the promise is destroyed no more promises by the way god won't ask you to offer your child again amen yeah we got to tell you that the prophet said god won't make a demand like that of man because even the one he demanded it from it was just to test him that's what the bible said god never allowed the offering of that child god knew what he was going to do but he was trying to vindicate abraham i'm waving before you and i to give us a sermon today for encouragement as a son [Music] amen take thy amen then only son and go out for him on the in maria on the mountain that i will show you can they give me that quotation please bring that quotation before let me establish the basis for this action you realize that when god made such a demand from abraham there was no record don't look at the body there was no record that he argued with god or is struggled with god abraham loved god enough that there wasn't anything too important not to give him amen [Music] in a place the prophet even said he never consulted his wife on that project because mother with a motherly instinct i'm surprised she was supporting that god bless you [Music] mother [Music] who did you say speak to you was it an apparition or a revelation or a crunch get next to yourself it was all between him and god watch that attitude and please ring it the prophet said your attitude towards christ fellowship with me a little here your attitude towards christ will make a great impression on what your children will be [Music] this is a solemn counsel to your parents i'm coming into parental now the way you relate with god will be a reflection upon your generation [Music] many children become do no good today not because they were bad themselves but it was the attitude of their parents that was being visited on them don't be quick evil inheritance on your generation if you give me two or three days i will show you throughout the scriptures how perfect this statement is when you go into the house of david david killed uriah with the sword of the hemorrhage it did the schemings and everything but you see there is nothing eating before god it will appear on the surface that was the amalekites or the amorites that killed urayah but the lord who saw through the plot came through the prophet is that you david you killed uriah using the sword of the amalekite and because of this that you did sword will not depart from your house how many ever read out in the bible because when certain things happen sometimes you need to look back that statement became the inspiration or the anointing for ammon the firstborn of david to desire that lady that girl tamar and by that gets destroyed by absalom that was it was that statement that pushed absalom to overthrow his father that it might also be destroyed it was sought upon such those children were not bad in themselves they were only ripping from the attitude of their father when eli compromised evilly with his children who were defiling women and polluting the service of the lord god said he that honors me will i honor because you honored your children above me if you read that scripture eli rebuke these children isn't it but god said it wasn't enough what else should have done is to remove them from those offices that gives them the opportunity to do those evil he never did god said i will turn things around he said i will destroy the family of eli and i will make it so bad until the blood of bulls and animals cannot atone for them so if that family will ever get a relief it will be by the blood of jesus christ watch the timing line leave till the time christ came and if you care to trace it go and trace it in like generations suffered the bible told them he said nobody with that old age among eli family he said that we all die their prime meaning that they have gone to school they've just graduated and about the time they want to settle down with a good job he's dead amen it wasn't happening by chance it was the attitude of the parents that robbed on them watch what you ain't putting as an inheritance for your generation live right it will help you if you are not doing well don't be an hypocrite in the body if you permit my rudeness even playing a progress is one of the most stupid things you can do it shows how foolish a man could be when you think you can pretend to be a saint in the house of the lord and live like a devil devil outside you may hide from the pastor but we are not dealing with the pastor as long as the pastor declares the old cancer he has done his job before god he is already excused but you are dealing with the one who does not need your invitation to enter your house that song says he entered all rooms even when the doors have been shot if you like close the door use security access lock paper put your password turn off the light be doing evil there god will say hello there [Music] so even though you are dealing with somebody whose presence you cannot avoid why are you foolish [Music] let me tell you this afternoon if you are living in sin [Music] and you think you are not caught it is not smartness it is a long suffering of god giving you a space to repent and if you do not repent by yourself i guarantee you assuredly your sin will find you out [Music] amen god bless you [Music] your attitude towards christ will make a great impression of what your children will be your life that you live before your family sons of god are you here amen the bible in the message thinking man's filter it was talking to the sisters and he was calling the attention to the fact that there were only two places the bible used the word reverence see that the church reverenced god and the wife reverence her husband is that right [Music] some brothers this is the only thing you are hearing here you get home today so what did the preacher say all the things i've been saying is not what he's expecting you to say he just wants you to bring that line reverence me and let me let me help you rub it in is it reverence is deeper than respect it's almost worship so sisters you must do it can they say amen sisters can you say amen hallelujah these are daughters of god spiritual sisters brothers can you collab for them [Music] [Applause] okay okay okay okay okay okay i think you enjoy that brothers you enjoy that right but do you know what is there he said you must live as a son of god [Music] you must live our sons of god [Music] you see these things fall in place effortlessly if the condition and the atmosphere facilitate each this is the way god arranges in his kingdom are you following me let me tell you the man that could tell your level of spirituality is not a pastor pastor we try except sometimes god will open his eyes to see certain things he judges you the best by what he sees you do and you see this place is full of light it's easy to be gentlemanly to be christianly even though you are hearing us at home some of you are ill if it is the truth just a search so you can be delivered [Music] when you live in denial you are not working for deliverance if you are living like a yearness at home i'm not saying you are the ayanna i cannot call you and i ain't it would be too disrespectful for me to call the son of god ayena but if he's living like that at all even though we don't call him one he must talk to that spirit and say are you not demon listen to the word of the lord and come out of me don't personalize anything or any bad habit you start personalizing them when the preacher attacks them and you are getting annoyed you are telling god that you are that person you are incapable in cause without spirit you shouldn't be people refuse their deliverance when they worship evil spirit and sympathize with them and they don't want to let them go they're preaching of the gospel ordinarily impurity cast out demons that is why nobody will ever go back the way it comes this is a cleansing this is the bathtub of god where you and i can be washed with the water of the world but you got to accept the word you've got to say the word is true then the demon will realize that you ain't discord with him and if we find yourself he will find you not a good habitation again is god to live if you don't live as a son of god the pastor may not know because god bless you brother oh so sweet oh god oh praise the lord in the spirit he lives his best here is it but at home is where you live yourself it might not be worse but that's where you live yourself and the closest person to know your spirituality is that woman amen if you are claiming the church is not the same at home she knows and even when the puzzle is saying oh we have such a lovely wonderful great spiritual spirit-filled pedigreed christian and the person of brotherhood let me use my name so you don't take offense in personal brother daily if i'm not living truly like that my wife would sit there and be smiling and say oh if only god will open the eyes of the pastor [Music] but until god chooses to open the eyes of the pastor the sisters say i will be praying then they will get home and the sister we just describe the brother as the pastor was described and this time around the brother would be on the edge he's not enjoying it i never said boys the same thing the person said i'm saying that the pastor can say it but not from you if you are saying it you must be up to something you know why he knows the woman knows him [Music] so let us live right let's live right let's live right let's all commit to god josiah brought the people of god he said let us agree to return to god so let us all agree to return to god even if there is a failure when we admit our failure the lord will bring deliverance what i'm saying is don't live an hypocritical life if you there are sometimes some patches of life that you can't fight alone this is the reason they said confess your faults to one another the person you are confessing to your father is not the one to forgive you the prophet the bible never said confess so that i can forgive you you didn't do him any wrong you didn't do any wrong isabel confess your fault to one another so you can pray the prophet said get a righteous man because sometimes the life some battles you can't fight alone but when god sees your messy your sincerity and desire for change it will come true for you you love him this afternoon say your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be amen because the bible said that it will visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children to deterred and foster generations and the prophet said somewhere if iniquity can be visited but if it's a blessing [Music] it can also be visited because what we are celebrating in abraham this afternoon is the passing down of generational blessings and if you can accept the generational blessing that came from abraham it becomes the abstract to the title deed that knocks out everything that was ever against you naturally whether it's your grandpa grandma your parents that did it he's going to knock it uproot it from the foundation and set you free whether it is a sin or sickness or a curse there is power in the blood that comes from the seed of abraham to set you free you love him all right so the object of the promise was to be destroyed completely and guess what abraham never cared as long as he was sure it was god who asked it took isaac you will see the secret thought behind his action it took isaac and two young men and all the things they needed and they were going first day they were all complete second day they were complete on the third day the crowd began to thin down first and second pool can be for hall but when it comes to the third pool tall pool is for a very very very very selected because when it comes to third pool it becomes the testimony it becomes the testimony of the disciples all men cannot receive this saying accept those for whom it is meant there is a generation that is prone to offence and anything christ does must offend them at some point and they must go back so that they will be from that time but there's a generation that must go through on the third day the two young men were left it became a narrow passage only for abraham and isaac and abraham told the two young men is that you guys still here i and the lord will go up and worship and come back amen amen amen what was informing this man's boldness was he you know was he applying faith and if it's you say it's faith in what way let me show you a radical formula abram wasn't expecting god to say don't kill that was not the basis for him saying all he has been saying i am the lord will go back that was not his motivation to say isaac let's go he wasn't expecting that god will say don't kill as a matter of fact abram was ready to kill i was looking forward to the killing so what did you gather from read your bible hebrews 11. but the revelation fate of abraham is this [Music] he said look at me i got this child when i was dead and quickened by god is that correct brother even if i cut this boy to 12 tribes of israel amen the one who turned me over is more than able to put him together and raise him up again [Applause] abraham came to a point in his experience in his work with god that he didn't see any impossibility again this is how the seeds of abraham must believe god are you listening to me yes i will kill him and he will raise him that was what he was working with so it is not a case i hope i'm believing there will be an intervention you won't find that in the bible what you will find in the bible is what i've just told you hebrews 11. if i got him at somebody who was as good as dead and really he was a dead man because the bible said it was old and well striking in age even lived in the days of noah it would be a small boy but for you to know our live stream is tuning down life expectancy came to just around 100 120 in the time of abraham so much so that a 100 year old man or a 99 year old man was taught to be well old and stricken in age when some people lived 969 before are you catching it everything about sarah was dry and empty and god reversed nature for a man who had tasted that goodness of the lord and there is none of you here who hasn't tasted the goodness of the lord but do you know the problem we have we forget too soon this is why david said oh bless the lord o my soul i'm forget not some of us are here we have seen the end of the lord in many ways then some light challenges will come away we would have forgotten that the reason god gave us victory show this mighty hand in those situation is to prepare us for greater challenge and yet give us an experience to appeal to that the god of yesterday is gonna be the god of today but when today comes you forget then you'll be praying some funny prayer like this god o lord for me to know you are god how long have you been related with god so it's been a statute all along it is this event now that will now make you know that is god this is a man who has been relating with god for the past 20 30 years he still doesn't know him as god is there for me to know you are god do this and sometimes god was there okay for me to train this child he will refuse to do it amen yes you ask him why he said i want him to learn obedience by the things he will suffer [Music] some of us are bred and butter christianity hey look there is so much for us in it as christians but we don't serve god because of what we get in it there's a difference i'm serving god so that he will do this for me we do that those things are part of it there are many things whether you ask or you don't ask god will do it for you oh man if your faith level can rise to it did he not say take no thought for what to eat what to drink where where shall we be included he said this is the occupation of the heathens your heavenly father you know that you need those things so if your faith can rise up to that level whether you pray for those things or not god is under obligation as long as you are walking with him to do those things now let me take you wire a believer must know and trust god's ability that he can do everything are you with me but if he chooses not to do is not because he cannot [Music] i don't know if that is clear god can do all things that's right but he might choose not to do not because he cannot exactly amend glory to god so if you are if you are serving him because of constant response do you know the prophet said evil is no is an answer [Music] okay okay okay let's do like this let's check this because we are going to spend eternity with these guys the three liberal children they told nebuchadnezzar we don't need to be wasting time you don't need to give us additional 10 more trials if you give us 100 more trials our position is still the same so let's not let's not waste time whatever you want to do it's fine we know our god will deliver us but watch the believer but if he chooses not to deliver ourselves [Applause] [Music] so as far as these guys are concerned it is central that god can but in his sovereignty he might choose not to and it wouldn't make any difference how is our experience going to stand with those folks [Music] come on church you've got all the types in the scriptures so this was the anchor of abraham i will kill the boy and he will raise the boy and i will come back with the boy so it's not the case of it was expecting god to say stop it didn't it never no scripture for that [Music] god bless you sir so they were going and this is for you parents now when they were going isaac got to the point that daddy stopped each other we've got this and we're going to worship the dad say yes we've got all the articles that could facilitate but where is the main object of sacrifice itself [Music] that is good parenting amen see tight parents i said that is good parenting amen america is a land off we pay bills we pay bills that's all you everywhere i gotta pay my bills i gotta pay my bills don't be paying your bills to the detriment of your main business god gave you those children because he has put in you the capacity to raise them not to raise them as americans rest them as citizens of the kingdom you must never slack in that responsibility amen you've got to find time to sit with them to share them the values of the world whether they are ready to open their ears to eat or not naturally at certain age they are rebels aren't you guys rebels you are rebels but the lord will heal rebellion i'm talking for all of them all of us pass through all those races few are blessed to be proper proper but in the majority we have rebels [Music] because you live under the pressure of the last days admits that you are you can be a rebel but he said the lord cures rebellion [Music] and we want you to know that unto you until you are delivered to have the hunger for the right thing we represent your holy ghost and we got to do our job promise we shall live right before you aha so parents will have a challenge you got to live right before them when you live right before them they are telling me they are not dons they are not that rebellious not to know what is right even if they are not doing it but you sustain righteousness it will take a hold in their life sometime the prophet said how do you apply the talking he said live right before them talk to them pray with them and keep the right atmosphere in your house [Applause] god will have a way of sorting out the rest some of you don't even spare time your children are old enough they don't know the articles of this message they don't know the conduct they don't know the order they don't know the doctrine even if they see the picture of the prophet they say it's just one white man somewhere shame on you [Music] you are too busy your basis of measurement before god is those children if you're a mother god will judge your motherhood if you're a father god will judge your father children are very important to god is that children are my heritage meaning god is a owner you only entrust them into your care that is why you must give account of your still worship and he said we are better that you are not born if you were born and you make a poor excuse of that say go hank god is not teaching you suicide but he's trying to show you why important and how deadly it could be if by your life you derail these children whether they like it or not tell them the truth do it in love and if there's a moment to give some protoplasmis stimulation do it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me tell you the reason children are decaying is because the nations are giving you formulas that are contrary to the world there is no nation under heaven that has a right to legislate or not to raise children did you hear me the person who has a right to give a manual to operate anything is the producer of that thing god is the one who gives children he is the one that can tell you how to raise a child this was a revelation a manual the father of something hurt when the angel came and told the mother that they're going to have a child don't forget they've been trusting god for a child for a long time but you know the news of getting the child wasn't as exciting to the man as to knowing how to raise the child it's in your bible he said the man of god who told you where is he he said the angela the man has gone i don't know whether there's an injury or anybody just told me and he left then this man being a spiritual man he has a feeling that the man will come again he said when he comes again just detain him and come and call me and when he came again actually all manual wanted to know how shall we raise the child we thank you we thank you for the good news that we're going to but i'm more interested and you should be more interested in how to raise the church friends you cannot give what you don't have even yourself [Music] so you need to be rest first before you start raising children otherwise it should be baby raising baby [Music] oh yes [Music] may god give you understanding but i call your attention to abraham here to show to you the success of child reason that guy as a teenager knows the article he said it is not too late it is not too early for you people to accept christ they say they want to be just like any other american girl in school america is not cool the better part the path god actually wants from you is your young age is i remember now that creator in the days of watch there is no youth there is no young person here who must not give their life to god that is god's demand he said remember now that creator in the days of what die youth don't give god your your retirement old body [Music] give him the best life at best is very brief the best quality of your life is from zero to 25 when you have all the four days of life standing strong after 25 you lose one so death that may kill you at 90 has already begun its work after 25. by the time you eat 40 45 you lose the second one by assisting you on your last ray of 65. so don't give god the haggard aspect of your life it decides it deserves the best let us make a pledge to serve the lord [Music] if it comes to you at all age it's fine no age is labeled god wants the best and do you know what the prophet said is that for those who have an opportunity they have the gospel and they don't do anything about it between that age to 25 or 22 is a pastor age conversion is possible but it becomes more difficult it becomes one more difficult may god give you understanding you love him so they went to the place i'm just showing you the attitude abraham had you know there was one thing that endeared abraham to god in terms of revelations god said shall i hide anything from abraham god does not and did not and will not even today hide anything from a seed of abraham if he meets these two things and that was the testimony isaac gave by his observation he said one abram is going to be here he's going to possess all things he said that number two god said i know him can god speak about that of you that he will teach his children so whatever revelation abraham received he passed it down abram wasn't a reservoir it was a channel so because god knew he would pass it on god was telling him more things a lot of your parents lack spiritual understanding because you are not available to be a channel you rather be a reservoir a collector and not a giver may god give us understanding i hope i'm not making it too tough am i making it to you thank you thank you don't worry i shall soon i shall close now let me wind out so they got to the place and in abraham's heart he already killed the child he took the knife if god didn't calculate his timing very well the head of that boy would be off his neck then god screamed abraham don't touch that boy why this is what you wanted i'm just i'm just i'm just plain [Music] abram lived alive he did something that god that god got so excited until he spoke as man listen to this he said now i know [Music] it was excitement [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he spoke like me and you [Music] could the man have loved me like this then there was nothing he couldn't give me my goodness god jumped again said now i know you got it they all knowing god is saying now i know as if he's adding to his learning to his understanding because a life in that excitement he began to really love blessings in blessing i will bless you in multiplying our multiplier i will your seat shall be this it was all on the excitement but whether it was an excitement or not once it comes out from his mouth he can take it back [Music] he extended the blessing on the children of abraham he said thy seed seeds that have not appeared by the attitude of their father they got an advanced inheritance thy seed shall possess [Applause] the gate of their enemies i'm a city of abraham don't be my enemy if you make yourself my enemy i will possess your gates it is compulsory it is automatic my father abraham gave me that by his attitude towards god now you could see why throughout the bible even to our lord jesus christ the royal seat no seed of abraham was defeated time will fail me to talk of daniel who suffer from the conspiracies of the noble princes they got him into alliance then he came out and the people who prepared the lions became the food for lions shall i talk of the three children [Music] [Applause] a man a man that was so blessed he said acid of abraham was the only problem he has in his life and his friends said if that's your only problem that will disturb you from enjoying all this great scholarship and wealth eliminate the problem and the moment they mentioned modica in their gathering the bible said they shall surely gather but because the gathering is not by him their council shall not stand anywhere you mention the name of the seed of abraham is a person of interest to the kingdom heaven must appear to take record [Music] so god took notes they were to kill mordecai the next day god said tonight i will finish the business satan cannot be faster or smarter than god for the sake of one man called modekai the sleep of the king was taken away and he was counting the columns of the ceilings and girls i didn't keep you awake to count the columns [Music] my son is at stake and something must be done go and take the book of remembrance and god guided him to the book and to the right chapter and it was modika's chapter it isn't a coincidence why would it be at the time that the life of modeka was at stake that such a remembrance will come and guess what modekai was sleeping easy he didn't even know what was going on are you catching us by the god of modika the keeper of israel neither sleep no slumber i and god cannot be keeping vigil he's keeping vigil over me so i can slip his [Music] by that night the king reached the report of i will have been assassinated and now it was mordecai that saved him and he asked all his palace officers it was no news to them we knew about that we knew about that so what has been done to this man is a bloody non-documented immigrant amen yeah he was an immigrant there's nobody to push his case so ah the king said this is serious so this is how you behave in the kingdom you didn't realize what a great thing this guy has done for you and i do you realize you have been assassinated it will have caused tension and crisis what created rwanda genocide that wiped out 700 000 people because one man was shot down in an air crash just one person and some tribes felt that this person that was shot must have been shot by this particular minor tribe and they started fighting and over 700 000 were wiped out that was what the king was telling the officers you don't know how these men save our kingdom you don't know you don't realize they were in that story till daybreak and heyman came do you know god never allowed amen to even declare his mission the reason they came to the king's palace that morning died with him he was coming to ask for modicai to be hanged on the gallows that he has prepared but the moment he entered the king said what shall be done to demand under king delight to honour the bible said because it was greedy for power sat down yeah i just said it who else would the king didn't lie to him even on me so i'm rising in probation again today all right let the king bring out his kingly us his kingly robe his kingly ring come he asks for everything kingly except the queen if he had his way you will have asked the queen to join the package and he said let another most noble not ordinary chief most noble prince you know you know what i mean king the top one he didn't want to mention the next one to him but he described him enough for the king to understand and the king said that's okay that's okay that's okay that's what should be done let that king let our prince be riding like an escort rider you know how the president's when they are going the advanced escort rider will be going then the beast will follow at some point two or three pieces can be following so that you don't know where president biden is that's what we're doing he said let it be real from fair you know we must honor the man thinking it was the one even the king realized that what a man demanded was too tough that was when he gave him the order he said you see in everything that you have said don't let anyone fail don't remove those upright exactly as you've said it since it was your idea you'll be able to do it better do me a favor go and do it for modica mo the king answered the guy ahmad will be like more watch the car [Music] it was too tough for him he said don't let anything fail and by the way you'll be the escort rider [Music] the blessings of abraham the inheritance of abraham upon his children when jacob ran away from the house of lebanon laban gathered hammy to go and wipe him out the god of jacob went to mid-level i said lavan you are choosing the wrong battle you see as far as this one you are running after you can do nothing amen there is no enchantment there is no divination there is no theory there is no conspiracy that can stand against you amen perish that us otherwise you will deal with me i know you will catch up with him but when you get to him say neither good no don't rebuke him don't commend him just appreciate yourself this was what abraham gave you that was what he gave them let us enjoy our inheritance god
