[4:12] exactly with the spirit of Jesus Christ
[4:14] the prophecy in Revelations the third
[4:17] chapter it said because thou sayest I am
[4:20] rich I have need of nothing and know not
[4:24] that thou art poor blind wretched
[4:28] miserable naked and don't know
[4:31] See, don't know it. What is it?
[4:34] Spiritual amnesia.
[4:36] They don't know it. That's right. The
[4:38] churches has got the the money now.
[4:41] There's not a church hardly in a
[4:42] country, a denominational what's worth
[4:44] millions, times millions of dollars,
[4:47] building millions and millions of
[4:48] dollars in buildings and things and
[4:50] preaching the coming of the Lord is at
[4:51] hand.
[4:54] Rich and said, "I have need for
[4:57] nothing." the best educated preachers
[4:59] they ever had, know more theology than
[5:02] they ever known. And they got the
[5:04] biggest buildings, the best selected
[5:06] places in the city. They got the ride
[5:08] away to anything they want to do. And
[5:10] then what did they do? Got spiritual
[5:12] amnesia and forgot that it was God that
[5:15] done that for them. Just like Israel and
[5:18] the Bible prophesied, Jesus Christ sent
[5:20] his angel to John and said this last
[5:23] church age would have this spiritual
[5:25] amnesia. They were wretched. Remember,
[5:27] they think they're big. They think they
[5:29] got something. But he said they were
[5:32] miserable, wretched, poor, blind, naked,
[5:37] and didn't know it. There's no way of
[5:39] telling them. Amen. Now, if a man was
[5:42] out here on the street disgraced or a
[5:44] woman naked on the street blind, that
[5:48] would be a pitiful shape to be in that
[5:50] shape. But then, if they had the right
[5:52] mind, knowing who they was, they was a
[5:55] human. and they're supposed to wear
[5:57] clothes. Well, you go out there, they're
[5:59] they're human beings, supposed to be
[6:00] identified with human race and out there
[6:03] wretched, miserable, blind, and naked.
[6:05] And you go to him and say, "Brother,
[6:07] you're naked." No, here I'm Dr. So and
[6:09] So, you just your own business. I'll
[6:12] tell you I belong to so and so. You
[6:13] ain't got no business, you holy roller,
[6:15] tell me
[6:20] nothing. Command to do this is for
[6:22] people to do the things that they're
[6:24] doing. and they'll let you know that
[6:25] they're preaching broadminded.
[6:29] What is it? If they've forgotten the
[6:32] Lord Jesus's commandments, they come
[6:35] down and do a signs and wonders that he
[6:37] said he would do. They don't want to
[6:39] believe it. That's right. It's spiritual
[6:40] amnesia.
[6:42] See, they have forgotten
[6:45] and they're naked and don't know it.
[6:48] Don't realize that they think that
[6:50] because I belong to church, that's all
[6:52] necessary. Oh brother, that means more
[6:54] to God than to be a mason or anything
[6:56] else, any other law to belong to church.
[6:59] That don't mean nothing to God. You've
[7:01] got to be sons and daughters of God.
[7:04] Amen. Got to be part of God. And God is
[7:06] the word.
[7:09] When I become part of my father, I
[7:11] become all my father. When you become
[7:13] part of God, you become God in full. His
[7:15] whole word. You believe all of it. Amen.
[7:18] Spiritual amnesia. What if you didn't
[7:20] know your name was what it was? And if
[7:23] you are, you have come from a fine
[7:25] family, which I hope you did. If you
[7:27] come from a fine family of people, and
[7:30] what if you forget that family name and
[7:32] you go by your living disgraceful? They
[7:34] say, "Aren't your name George or
[7:36] whatever?" Well, I don't know who I was.
[7:38] See? All right. See, that's a horrible
[7:41] thing to be, a horrible condition to get
[7:43] into. Well, that's just where the church
[7:45] has gone. is supposed to be the
[7:47] representation of Jesus Christ. Yes. But
[7:50] it's forgot that because it's got
[7:52] injected into it creeds and
[7:54] denominations. Yes. That they've
[7:56] accepted that instead of the word. Yes.
[7:59] And they're naked, blind, miserable, and
[8:01] don't know it and no way to tell them.
[8:04] Right. I may never be in Birmingham
[8:07] again, but this is one time they're
[8:08] going to hear it.
[8:10] Amen. Right.
[8:12] I'm just I'm not responsible for another
[8:14] sewing seed.
[8:17] God directs it to the ground where it's
[8:18] supposed to go. Forgot. Yes, they forgot
[8:22] the word of the promise. They forgot.
[8:25] Israel has that kind of affix. When
[8:27] Jesus come forgot they look or they said
[8:30] they believe there's coming a messiah,
[8:31] but the Messiah come and identify
[8:33] himself by the
[8:35] word. They had so many traditions till
[8:37] they made the word of God of no effect.
[8:41] And Jesus promised just before the end
[8:45] time as it was in Sodom, so would it be
[8:48] if they identified it, the people are so
[8:50] traditional till it made the promise of
[8:53] God of no effect by their tradition,
[8:55] right? Spiritual amnesia.
[8:58] Spiritual amnesia is exactly what it is.
[9:00] See, they have forgotten these things.
[9:02] Oh, I belonged to this. I I done this.
[9:04] I've danced in the spirit. I did this
[9:05] one. My my. That has nothing to do with
[9:07] it.
[9:08] Not at all. How can you be a Christian
[9:11] and deny the word? You can't do it. God
[9:14] is the word. The word's in you. You and
[9:16] the word are the same. All the word is
[9:18] you are. Amen. If I'm living in this
[9:22] generation, what this portion of words
[9:24] promises this generation, I've got to be
[9:26] that. If I'm going to be a Christian,
[9:28] I've got to be identified with all that
[9:30] the Bible preaches and stands for.
[9:33] Hallelujah. Going to call me a hoy over
[9:35] anyhow. I feel pre-religious right now.
[9:38] Amen.
[9:40] I've got to be identified with
[9:42] everything that that Bible claims.
[9:46] And give it claims. And if I haven't
[9:48] been stricken with this modern day
[9:50] spiritual amnesia, I am will be and can
[9:53] be identified with him. If I deny it,
[9:57] then I've got spiritual amnesia.
[9:59] Something has happened. I've accepted a
[10:02] creed or a doctrine or some church or
[10:04] group of man. I can't do it. When yet
[10:06] the word comes and identifies itself.
[10:08] That's why Jesus wasn't recognized. Oh,
[10:11] they say, "Well, this man's holy. This
[10:13] our holy priest are holy this." And
[10:15] Jesus said, "You're of your father, the
[10:17] devil, and his works you'll do." Did you
[10:19] know Cain offered a good sacrifice, too?
[10:22] He was sincere. Build an altar, knelt
[10:24] down in worship, and offered a sacrifice
[10:26] and prayed to God. And if God, that's
[10:29] all God requires for you to belong to
[10:30] church and have an altar and pay your
[10:32] tithes and go to church and live a good
[10:34] life. If that's all he requires, he was
[10:36] unjust to condemn Cain because he did
[10:38] the same thing.
[10:40] Yes. Exactly. But religion means a
[10:43] covering. And you can't be covered by
[10:46] your own good works. There's only one
[10:48] thing that God will accept and that's
[10:49] the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's
[10:52] the only covering. Outside of that, if
[10:54] you say keep the creed, spiritual
[10:56] amnesia, that's what happened. Now,
[10:58] notice they have forgot their word. They
[11:01] have forgot the Bible. They have forgot
[11:03] the promise. They're trying to live in a
[11:05] glare of what Methodist was, what
[11:07] Baptist was, what somebody else was.
[11:09] Here's the promise of the day, and God
[11:11] speaking it through his word and
[11:12] confirming again, proving that it is so.
[11:14] And they still don't believe it.
[11:16] Spiritual amnesia. It's exactly right.
[11:20] Total total amnesians.
[11:22] absolutely don't believe at all. A
[11:25] French soldier of us told a little story
[11:27] before we closed. I didn't know it was
[11:29] even that late and I got about 10 pages
[11:31] of notes here left. Get it some other
[11:33] time.
[11:34] Notice a French soldier. They got a
[11:37] bunch of soldiers in from the army and
[11:39] they had this
[11:40] amnesia. It's from shock on the battle
[11:43] and they had a program and they they
[11:46] called up and let people who had missing
[11:48] loved ones to call and see if they could
[11:50] identify these boys. No hope for him.
[11:52] Maybe one or two out of it caught it.
[11:55] Then they took the rest of them. They
[11:56] going to put them in a sanitarium where
[11:57] they'd have to stay the rest of their
[11:59] life. This going up the hillside train
[12:02] pulling and they stopped at a station.
[12:03] Let the boys get out and stretch their
[12:04] legs and the guards got out on the hill
[12:06] to watch them because with amnesia why
[12:08] they they had to watch him. So they
[12:11] watched one young fellow there. He got
[12:12] out and began to look around that water
[12:14] tank. Looked all around over the hill.
[12:17] He rubbed his face and he stududded and
[12:21] he looked again. He seen that water
[12:23] tank. He looked all around the station
[12:25] and he started walking. Instead of the
[12:27] guard stopping him, he followed him. He
[12:29] went up over the hill down a little
[12:31] path, turned to the right, went up over
[12:33] another little hill and come to a little
[12:35] log cabin. He looked coming out on the
[12:37] porch and old man with a cane in his
[12:39] hand come out, throw his arms around
[12:40] him, said, "My son, I know you would
[12:42] return. They told me you were dead, but
[12:44] I know you would return." And the boy
[12:46] come to himself. His amnesia left him.
[12:50] He could identify who he was. He know
[12:53] that was his father. Oh, soldier of the
[12:56] cross has been shocked with so
[13:00] much training. So many shocks of
[13:03] denomination and creed and things of the
[13:05] world. Why don't you just step off for a
[13:08] few minutes and go looking around at the
[13:09] Bible? Might wander around. You might
[13:11] find yourself identified here in the
[13:13] word as a believer one of these days.
[13:15] You might not know them. You may come to
[13:17] yourself like the prodical son did and
[13:20] find yourself.
[13:22] You may find your identification in the
[13:24] words of God. Someone said the other
[13:26] night long ago said, "But brother
[13:28] Brandham, look at us Pentecostal people.
[13:30] What fine churches we got." Well, we we
[13:32] got ministers has been trained. Listen,
[13:34] when a man marries a wife, he doesn't
[13:38] trust in her beauty. No, he trusts in
[13:41] the loyalty of her vow, her word. He
[13:43] doesn't trust in her beauty. He trusts
[13:45] in her loyalty. And that's the way when
[13:48] you marry to God, you don't trust in
[13:49] some big beautiful church you can build,
[13:51] but in the promise that Jesus Christ
[13:53] made that I'm the same yesterday, today,
[13:56] and forever. Amen. Do you believe that?
[13:58] Amen. Let us bow our head just a moment.
[14:00] Hallelujah.
[14:04] I wonder tonight in the building here
[14:07] where the people are sitting where there
[14:12] is men and women who are eternal
[14:15] eternity bound
[14:17] people and you know that someday or
[14:20] other you've got to meet God. And I
[14:22] wonder if you had a little breath of
[14:24] that amnesia and you would you've been
[14:29] identified in the wrong thing and you
[14:31] you'd like to kind of wander around
[14:33] through tonight and find out if you
[14:34] can't be identified in Christ
[14:37] Jesus. Would you raise up your hand?
[14:40] Say, "Pray for me, Brother Brandham. I I
[14:42] want to be identified as a real
[14:44] Christian, a real believer." God bless
[14:46] you. God bless you. Bless you. Oh, yes.
[14:49] way around. Lord God bless
[14:54] you. Somebody up in the balcony and say,
[14:57] "Brother, I really believe that's the
[14:59] truth. I believe as Christians, we're
[15:01] not Christians like they used to be
[15:02] years ago. What about you Pentecostal
[15:05] people and your mothers and fathers?
[15:07] stand on the street out here and be an
[15:08] old tambourine and your mother how she
[15:12] had to wear and struggle a few little
[15:17] children. Sometimes you had to go
[15:19] without clothes and everything else but
[15:21] dad and mother was faithful to the
[15:23] cause to hold up Christ. Look what your
[15:26] Pentecostal people did 50 years ago. You
[15:30] come out of the
[15:31] organization. That's what makes you
[15:33] Pentecost. You separate yourself from
[15:35] the unbeliever. Like a hog to his wife
[15:38] and a dog to his father, he went right
[15:40] back and done nothing. Made the same
[15:42] kind of oppression come out. What's the
[15:44] matter? Spiritual amnesia broke
[15:48] out among the people. You got your
[15:51] creeds and your denominational papers
[15:53] now and you're right up with the rest of
[15:54] them and want to be with the rest of
[15:56] them. You permitted your women to cut
[15:58] their hair and wear a painting. You
[15:59] you're permitting them to do all these
[16:01] things, permitting all this stuff in the
[16:03] church.
[16:05] What is it? Spiritual amnesia. Then the
[16:08] first thing you know when God begins to
[16:09] visit amongst some people, man, what
[16:11] happened? You can't receive it. See,
[16:14] you've been so sick of that amnesia.
[16:17] See, the only thing you've ever heard,
[16:20] don't you think you ought to step off of
[16:21] that cre just for a few minutes and pick
[16:22] up the Bible and see what a Christian is
[16:25] supposed to be to identify like these
[16:27] signs shall cause them that believe.
[16:30] Acts Peter said, "Repent every one of
[16:32] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[16:34] Christ for the remission of sin and you
[16:36] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[16:38] Ghost. For the promise is to you, your
[16:40] children, and that is for all, even as
[16:42] many as the Lord our God shall call." If
[16:44] they tell you that it isn't so, then
[16:46] your pastor has a bad case of spiritual
[16:49] amnesia. He can't find himself identify
[16:51] with that church.
[16:53] Not an organization, a church, a
[16:55] mythical body of Christ.
[16:58] Now, Holy Ghost is here. Be sure to do
[17:01] just exactly what he promised to
[17:04] do. Now, while you're here with your
[17:07] heads bowed, just keep it praying. Let
[17:11] the Holy Spirit speak itself and see if
[17:13] this anyone knows as a promise what it
[17:15] is for this day. Now, you that's in need
[17:18] tonight. You, many of you raised up
[17:20] their hands. Before you do that, I
[17:22] wonder while we're here really praying
[17:24] for the sick, I wonder if you can get
[17:26] away from that unbelief, that
[17:27] denomination, that Greek that tells you
[17:29] these things are not so. That's one that
[17:31] would tell you it's of the devil. When
[17:33] they do that, they'll never be forgiven
[17:35] in this world or the world to come. What
[17:37] it is is the truth. Just think, what if
[17:40] it is, then are
[17:42] you? So, you don't have to speak it out.
[17:44] Just believe it in your heart. And
[17:46] there's people here that believe that.
[17:48] I've sat right here for the last two
[17:50] nights. You're laboring under something
[17:52] you might hold my tongue to get you
[17:54] going right out. And remember,
[17:56] friend, it's between you and God. What
[17:59] if it is wrong and you think of that?
[18:00] You know what happens? You'll never be
[18:02] forgiven for
[18:03] it. Spiritual amnesia to go right on
[18:06] into your eternal
[18:09] death unbelieving. He that believeth not
[18:12] has been condemned already.
[18:17] I pray for your sickness. Say, "Lord
[18:19] Jesus, you promise." I may be some
[18:21] strangers here that's never been here
[18:22] before.
[18:24] Jesus promised like it was I'll take one
[18:26] scripture in the
[18:30] days when God was manifested in a body
[18:33] of flesh and the
[18:36] people Abraham the elected group the
[18:40] called out and Abram's name was changed
[18:43] to
[18:44] Abraham and then he seen the word made
[18:47] flesh and it discerned the thoughts that
[18:49] was in Sarah's heart and when the royal
[18:52] seed of Abraham that's what he did and
[18:54] he called him a devil. He said, "Now
[18:56] when the Holy Ghost comes, he'll do the
[18:58] same thing." Said, "I forgiveness when
[19:00] you call me that, but when you speak
[19:01] against the Holy Ghost, there's no
[19:03] forgiveness. I may be in his power. Come
[19:06] through this audience of evil wherever
[19:08] you are." And with this spiritual
[19:11] discernment, showing that he is the word
[19:14] so that if there's any here suffering
[19:16] with
[19:18] amnes will be without any excuse before
[19:20] this altar calls me.
[19:24] May the Lord God
[19:28] help now with your heads bowed
[19:31] reverently
[19:32] praying. The there's a lady sitting here
[19:35] before me. She's got her hands up to her
[19:37] face. She's suffering with a spinal
[19:40] condition and she's also got
[19:43] nervousness. She's got stomach
[19:46] trouble and she's sitting here before me
[19:48] now. And she might know that she's not
[19:51] from this country. She's from a city
[19:54] called
[19:57] Megan. Yeah. You believe God can tell me
[20:00] who you are? You're Miss Heirs. That's
[20:03] right. Raise up your hand. I'm a
[20:04] stranger to you. That's true, isn't it?
[20:06] Now your trouble's over. Jesus Christ.
[20:10] You touched his garment. He made you
[20:12] whole. Thank you, Jesus. I just believe
[20:14] it. Thank you, Jesus.
[20:18] There's a man sitting in the back of the
[20:21] building. He's seeking the baptism of
[20:23] the Holy
[20:24] [Music]
[20:27] Ghost. He wants the baptism with the
[20:30] spirit. He stands here before
[20:33] me. He's not from here
[20:36] either. He's from
[20:39] Carolina,
[20:41] Charlotte. Lipo is his name.
[20:45] Believe with all your heart and God will
[20:46] fill you with the Holy Ghost, my my
[20:48] brother, if you'll believe it.
[20:50] Hallelujah.
[20:55] Here over to my
[20:57] right. Here is a a man and his wife
[21:03] sitting right straight in front of here.
[21:06] It's an old couple to my
[21:09] right. The lady suffering with a colon
[21:12] condition. Her husband has heart
[21:16] trouble. They're not from here. They're
[21:18] from
[21:19] Tennessee. Mr. and Mrs.
[21:22] Thomas, if you believe with all your
[21:24] heart, raise up your hands and you can
[21:26] accept your healing. Jesus Christ make
[21:28] you well. Praise the Lord. That's
[21:30] exactly what he promised to do. I never
[21:32] seen the people in my life. Amen.
[21:34] Spiritual amnesia. Jesus said, "The
[21:37] works that I do shall do also for a
[21:39] little while, and the world will accept
[21:41] me no more. Yet ye shall see me, for I
[21:45] first of all will be with you, even in
[21:47] you to the end of the world. Jesus
[21:50] Christ is saying yesterday, today, and
[21:51] forever. Now, the men and women in here
[21:54] that just got something wrong with you
[21:56] that you just simply can't see how you
[21:59] you want to believe, but you just can't
[22:01] get into it. And you'd like to be prayed
[22:03] for. You want to accept him while you're
[22:05] in his presence, but you come and stand
[22:07] on your body, that great lay hands on
[22:08] him, and come out of your world. You
[22:10] that's suffering like that was a
[22:12] spiritual temptation and would want to
[22:14] be prayed for that you be released from
[22:16] that. If you're not a not a believer
[22:19] born, come up here saying, "God bless
[22:21] you, young man. Somebody else come bless
[22:23] you, lady. God bless you, young lady.
[22:25] Somebody else come. Come here. Stand
[22:27] right up here just now." Spiritual
[22:29] amnesia. I don't want to be plaggued
[22:30] with that. God forbid. Let me let me die
[22:33] the death of a of anything, but never
[22:36] let me die that death. As an unbeliever,
[22:40] come accepting how won't you do it? Come
[22:42] from Come down out of the balcony,
[22:44] friends. It's just a few steps down here
[22:46] and it might mean the difference between
[22:47] death and life to you. Look, I can't
[22:50] make Christ do nothing. Christ don't
[22:52] have to do anything but one thing. He
[22:54] has to keep his word. He must do that in
[22:58] order to be Christ be God. He must keep
[23:00] his word. Now remember, if you're not
[23:02] sure of your experience, why not come
[23:04] down now? If you just belong to a
[23:06] denomination, if you are a Pentecostal
[23:09] grandchild, God don't have any
[23:10] grandchildren. He has sons and
[23:12] daughters, but no grandsons and
[23:14] daughters. And God don't have that. He
[23:16] just has sons and daughters. And you
[23:18] know that you're not. Maybe you spoke
[23:20] with tongues. You might have danced. You
[23:21] might have done all this. That's all
[23:23] right. I have nothing against it. But
[23:25] yet, if you still got that spiritual
[23:27] amnesia, come on down and come here and
[23:29] stand here. Let's pray about it. What do
[23:30] you say? Church member, just a just a
[23:33] nominal church member, why don't you
[23:35] come up here and let's get rid of it
[23:36] right now. I don't want to leave
[23:38] Birmingham here and know that someday
[23:40] when the judgment comes up and I've got
[23:42] to stand then before you and remember
[23:44] I'm going to meet you again if I never
[23:45] meet you here on this or I'm going to
[23:46] meet you at the judgment and I've got
[23:48] the answer for what I said tonight.
[23:50] Amen. Now this is great hintry hint come
[23:54] out of it. Get out of there. Come on
[23:57] now. That ought to make every bobhaired
[24:00] woman in this country this place come up
[24:01] here now. That's exactly right. that you
[24:04] haven't got grace enough to really say I
[24:06] I I I want to I want to let my hair grow
[24:09] out brother Brandham you know but I
[24:11] haven't got the grace to do it why you
[24:13] say has got anything to do with it
[24:15] you're not long ago a real great
[24:17] minister come to me said I want to lay
[24:19] hands on you brother said everybody
[24:21] regard you as a prophet I said I never
[24:23] said I was a prophet he said but the
[24:24] people regard that you're always caring
[24:26] for me about wearing shorts and a
[24:29] Pentecostal man and said why wearing
[24:31] shorts and things said that's not your
[24:34] business. I said whose business is it
[24:35] then? And he said, "Them people, why
[24:38] don't you teach them women how to be
[24:40] have great spiritual gifts and help
[24:42] people instead of trying to said they
[24:44] regard you? What you tell them? They'd
[24:46] believe you." Said, "Why don't you tell
[24:47] them how to get great gifts and to help
[24:49] people instead of always condemning
[24:50] them?" I said, "How can I teach them
[24:52] algebra when they won't even learn their
[24:54] ABCs?"
[24:56] You got to start from the bottom.
[24:58] Repent.
[25:00] Perish. How you yourself?
[25:04] Repent or perish.
[25:07] Jesus Christ has thoroughly identified
[25:09] himself here night after night. This is
[25:11] a night which turning over for this
[25:13] salvation. It's just a few steps up here
[25:15] and I got plenty of time to wait.
[25:18] Remember Birmingham, your blood not up
[25:22] on me. I'm innocent. And if you haven't
[25:25] really gotten the Holy Spirit, you've
[25:28] got an opportunity to come down. Amen.
[25:31] And if you're suffering with some kind
[25:33] of a church entity has caused you to
[25:35] have spiritual amnesia, why don't you
[25:37] come? Jesus is the cure. Amen.
[25:41] Won't you come?
[25:43] Some people left the balcony just
[25:45] waiting to see whether we're going out
[25:46] or coming to the altar. These down here,
[25:48] come on up around. That's right. You
[25:50] that are here, come stand around the
[25:51] altar. Say, "I'm finished with this."
[25:53] Yes, they were coming down. Dear ladies,
[25:55] that's fine. Come right on up. Now, just
[25:57] a few steps from it. And that steps
[25:58] might mean the difference. Now look, I
[26:00] want to ask you something. What if he
[26:03] does come
[26:04] tonight or say he is coming? I don't
[26:07] know whether he is or not. This is the
[26:09] last sign. Remember, thus sayaeth the
[26:12] Lord. Did you ever hear me say that with
[26:15] what was true? You're seeing your last
[26:17] sign.
[26:20] That's scripture.
[26:22] You've seen your last sign. Pentecost.
[26:26] Don't get mixed up now with what he
[26:28] promised Israel after the rapture. That
[26:30] ain't you. You're done,
[26:32] man. Now's your day. Now's your sign.
[26:35] Now's your time. Don't reject it.
[26:38] Don't do it. You've ever
[26:40] come. You may need to be God's servant.
[26:44] Remember, Birmingham, I've never met
[26:46] nicer people. You're the nicest people I
[26:49] want to meet in my life. But you need a
[26:52] revival.
[26:54] You're dying. Amen. You're taking
[26:58] spiritual anesa.
[27:00] You're dying. Don't do that. Revive that
[27:02] watching of God. Bring it up again
[27:04] quickly before Jesus comes.
[27:08] All right, father. Keep coming. Just let
[27:10] him keep coming till we get all of the
[27:12] Lord's calling up here. Come now. Get
[27:15] rid of that
[27:16] amnesia. The great physician is here now
[27:19] to heal that. Take it away from him.
[27:21] He's proved that he's here. How many
[27:23] will identify that? But raise up your
[27:24] hands. say, "I truly believe it." And he
[27:26] said, "You do this." See, now he's sure.
[27:29] See, you believe. And how many knows,
[27:31] I'm telling you the truth, that you're
[27:33] dying and need a revival. It's true.
[27:36] You're fine people. You can't find no
[27:38] better. No better hearts beating out of
[27:40] these old southern shirts down here.
[27:42] That's right. Real people. But folks,
[27:44] you better wake up right quick.
[27:47] An hour that you think not. It might
[27:49] happen. It might not happen. I don't
[27:51] know. But remember, you're giving your
[27:53] last warning.
[27:56] So flee while you have time to flee.
[27:59] [Music]
[28:01] Come now. As long as they're coming, I'm
[28:03] going to keep waiting because there
[28:05] might one soul's worth 10,000 worlds.
[28:08] And as long as people are being
[28:09] convinced, I'd like to see this break
[28:11] into a great big revival that set up a
[28:13] church around here to break up your
[28:14] differences and get all that selfishness
[28:16] away and accept the Holy Ghost. You
[28:20] claim you believe it.
[28:22] You claim to believe it and when it
[28:23] comes to identify itself, then you'll
[28:26] pull apart from one another. Why not
[28:28] join our hearts with God's word? Amen.
[28:32] That's what you just keep on dying,
[28:34] dying, and you're going right on out
[28:35] into Lady Osia. Exactly what he
[28:37] promised. It'll be that way. Won't you
[28:40] come now? Now is the day. Now is
[28:43] accepted time. Watch what the Holy
[28:45] Spirit will do. Now, I want all the
[28:48] ministers here that's interested in
[28:49] these people, come pray with me, too.
[28:51] Come up here. All ministers that's
[28:53] interested in these people, come just
[28:55] come right around. Get in among the
[28:57] people.
[29:00] A minister or a personal worker, a good
[29:03] personal worker, a woman that won't
[29:04] stand with these women. Now, I'm going
[29:06] to believe with all my heart that the
[29:08] Holy Ghost is going to come into this
[29:10] place right here now and just identify
[29:12] himself all among these people. Now, let
[29:14] me instruct these people here first.
[29:16] Now, friends, whatever you're here for,
[29:18] he knows. Now, I can prove it to you. I
[29:20] take one by one, bring you up here on
[29:22] this platform, and there won't be one
[29:24] thing that you won't make known. Now,
[29:26] that's been since I was a little boy.
[29:28] That gift's not in question. But the
[29:30] question is, can you receive it? Do you
[29:33] believe it? Now, he's here. One, if he's
[29:35] here, then he's only one thing. He keeps
[29:37] his word. Then just believe that you
[29:39] receive it and accept it. Raise up and
[29:41] say, Lord God, I'm here to accept it.
[29:42] and just stay there till it happens.
[29:44] Amen. Like Buddy Robinson said one time
[29:47] in a corn field, he said, "Lord, if you
[29:48] don't give me the Holy Ghost, when you
[29:50] come back, you'll find a pile of bones
[29:51] laying right here." He was dead earnest
[29:54] and you're not going to get anything
[29:55] from God that you get desperate about.
[29:58] Now, have you noticed today crop? Have
[30:00] you noticed today what we do? We
[30:02] actually we got enough God about us to
[30:04] we come up to the platform. We say,
[30:06] "Yes, maybe I better come up." Now, this
[30:08] is the experience of worldwide. Yes, I
[30:12] better go up and stand and say,
[30:14] "Well, well, I don't know. Here I am.
[30:18] See, what a place to be in. There's no
[30:21] fire burning. There's no enthusiasm.
[30:24] There's not I go into it." And as an
[30:27] evangelist, that just kills me to see
[30:29] God's people in that shape. Amen. We're
[30:33] supposed to be on fire. Amen. But you
[30:35] see, what is it? It's exactly what I
[30:37] told you. Revelation 3, you're lukewarm.
[30:39] And he said, "Because you're lukewarm,
[30:41] then I'm going to spew you out of my
[30:43] mouth." That's right. That's what he
[30:46] said. And if he said that, that's what
[30:47] he's going to do. So, let's not be that
[30:50] crowd. You're your deed. Let's get it or
[30:53] die right here. Let's get it or die.
[30:56] Now, my dear brother, sister, if I could
[30:59] come down and help you do something, I'd
[31:01] sure do it. Now, by gift, I can tell you
[31:05] what you're here for. I can tell you
[31:07] what by the Holy Ghost, by God's spirit
[31:09] tell you what you've come for, what
[31:12] you've done, what will be in the future
[31:14] or something like that. But that don't
[31:16] take care of it. You've got to accept
[31:19] this yourself. Amen. It's got to be you.
[31:23] Now, are you ready? Raise up your hand.
[31:25] Say, "I'm ready. I'm ready to die right
[31:27] here." Don't do it unless you mean it.
[31:30] I'm ready to die right here or get what
[31:32] I want from God. Amen. Are you really
[31:35] ready? Then let the audience stand
[31:37] everywhere.
[31:39] Thank you Jesus. Now
[31:42] together let's unite ourselves together.
[31:46] Let's pray. And let's just you ministers
[31:49] now walk up to these people here.
[31:50] Everyone and you're representing the
[31:54] hands of Christ now. You that wants the
[31:56] Holy Spirit, you that wants that
[31:58] experience, not a emotional excitement.
[32:01] You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the
[32:04] germ of life inside you and you want to
[32:08] get rid of that amnesia that's making
[32:10] you can't identify yourself. You don't
[32:12] know where you stand. You don't know
[32:14] what you are. Let's get rid of it right
[32:16] now. There's a new birth here for you. A
[32:18] real genuine new birth. Now, let's lay
[32:21] our hands over on these people. Let's
[32:23] everyone raise up our hands and pray
[32:25] with one accord. Heavenly
[32:28] Father, in the name of the Lord
[32:32] Jesus, grant law that in Jesus Christ's
[32:36] name that the Holy Ghost will come
[32:39] tonight, this Saturday night, for the
[32:42] Holy Ghost like a rushing mighty wind.
[32:45] May these people be baptized into the
[32:47] Holy Ghost. May the fire and power of
[32:50] God, not leave them. If you're here in
[32:52] the morning, may they stay stay until
[32:55] the Holy Ghost come. That's the idea.
[32:58] That's it. There it is. That's the Holy
[33:00] Ghost coming. I done done it. That's so
[33:04] believe it now. Accept it. Be filled
[33:06] with his
[33:17] [Music]
