========================================

[Music] just beyond anything that we could express in human languages of how our hearts feel today as we gather here on this most solemn sacred morning today this morning represents the time that when our religion was made real because it was the rising up again of thy precious child who came to redeem the whole human race and we're here this morning in celebration of that great supreme triumph lord that made us more than conquerors of both death hell and the grave praise and we thank thee that after all these years have passed we still gather early every morning on this easter morning to worship him because we believe that he shall come again [Music] and we would pray that you would forgive all of our sins and our trespasses that is recorded against us as we humbly confess our wrong and accept his atonement for our sins heal the sickness that's in the midst of us lord help us as we read thy holy word which is the foundation of all of the truths that you have left for us to live by and to believe [Music] and we pray not only for this group that's gathered here but all around the world while we are looking with eager eyes and longing hearts for his return we stand today in darkness in a chaos that when most any time that some fanatic might just blow up about something and turn a little button then the whole world could be blown into bits as it has been told us by great authorities that the wars will only be a few hours long if it ever happens again oh as we're standing today on the very brim of another war for we shall be caught up together with the sleeping saints to meet the lord in the air and forever be with him we have come to worship the lord and receive us today please bless the reading of thy word the singing of the song the preaching of the gospel receive the prayers of the penitent hear a prayer for the sick and get glory unto ourselves are we humbly asked it in the name of jesus thy son amen to you who would like to take were we're to read this morning for our scriptures and we're sorry that this to know that we do not have the seating room for this fine group of people who's come early this morning to worship with us from different churches and from different states and even different nations has gathered this morning here at the tabernacle for this most glorious worship of the lord amen i wish for you to turn to the book of psalms psalms 22. i know this is rather an unusual place to read for an easter service but god is unusual and now after this service we will adjourn in about one hour so that you may go for your breakfast and then sunday school service will start at 9 30 and then immediately after the sunday school service there will be baptismal service here at the the pool and then this afternoon at six o'clock prayer cards will be given out for healing service for tonight and if you have any loved ones that's sick and needy remember to bring them out tonight and for this will be the last time we can have this for a while anyhow i'm leaving in the morning at five o'clock for los angeles and through the west coast for a series of services [Music] now in psalms 22 we shall read my god my god why has thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me from the words of my roaring my god i cry in the daytime but thou hearst not and in the night season and am not silent but thou art holy oh thou that inhabits the praises of israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou did deliver them they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded but i am a worm and no man a reproach of man despised of the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip and they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighteth in him but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mother's breasts i was cast upon thee from the womb dark my god from my mother's belly be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of basham have beset me around they gasp upon me with their mouth as a raving and roaring line i am pouring out like water all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a potter's my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou has brought me unto the dust of the earth for dogs have come past me the assemblies of the wicked have closed me they pierce my hands and my feet i may tell all my bones that they look and stare up on me they parted my garments among them cast lots upon my vesture be thou not far from me o lord my strength hasten thee to help me deliver my soul from the sore my darling from the power of the dogs save me from the lion's mouth for thou has heard me from the horns of the unicorn i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation i will praise thee yea ye that fear the lord praise him all yeast seeds of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye seeds of israel for he is not despised or part of the affliction neither has he hid his face from him but when he cried unto him he heard my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay my vows before them that fear him the meat shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord that seek him your heart shall live forever all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nation shall worship before him for the kingdom is of the lord and he is the governor among the nations all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive his own soul a seed shall serve him it shall be accounted to the lord for a generation they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people and shall that shall be born that he has done this may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word i want to take for this occasion this morning five words and around those five words try to express what's on my heart to you worshipers this morning i want these five words living dying buried rising coming and i think the poet well expressed it in the song of what i'd want to say when he wrote this song living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day thank god there never was a life ever lived like his because he was the god manifested in the flesh when he was born he was an expression of what god the father is and god the father being loved then jesus was a full expression of love he was loved from the very first time that his little baby hand stroked the pretty cheeks of his mother he was loved and i think today that that's where manny is failing to recognize that he was love god is love and they that love are born of god god's soul love the world that is the unlovable that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but would have everlasting life he expressed his love when he was your on earth in so many different ways till it is undisputable that he was the most loving creature that ever lived now i think in his life here he was expressing god in the only way that god can be expressed to the people is through love and well did he do this when he caught one of the most balanced women nectar was of his days perhaps they found her just guilty and no way out when she was found in adultery and they'd drug her up before him and said what do you say do for her and when he turned to her and said i don't condemn thee go and sin no more instead of being throwing her out to the streets to be drug out like a bunch of wolves over her to stone her and take her life his tender kind loving heart stew weighed down into the sin that she was in [Music] said i don't condemn me just go and don't sin no more and when he was on his way down to the grave of lazarus i think there's another great time that he expressed what god is to the human beings not only is he a god that can forgive the lord's sin that can be committed and take the guilty and make them guiltless by his pardoning love but after death has laid us in silence he's still concerned about us hallelujah i think he will express that on the road down with martha and mary when he come to the housework death and shut out the life of a lovely person and always wrote down to the grave yet being god know that he would raise him from the dead amen know that it had been told him then in his very words laid the power to raise him from the grave amen yet when he seen martha and mary and those who loved lazarus crying the bible said he wept what was it his great loving heart hey when he seen that man and his his friends were in trouble he was troubled with them i'm so glad to know that he can be found amongst the brokenhearted praise god in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us [Music] he stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of earthly reaching has come to its end he's still gone and loves us he was the expression of god know how i believe that he longs for his people to be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our hearts that's been borned off his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the living god that will express what he said or the poet said living he loved me he showed what he did to the whole human race the way god represented himself in jesus christ amen he expressed his opinion to the human race to forgive and to love those who were unlovable and i wonder on this easter morning how short we followed that we can love those who love us but he loved those who did not love him he was the greatest of representation of love that ever hit the earth and it was despised of those who lived on the earth to whom he loved no man could ever love like him and no man was ever hated like him they hated him and despised him and rejected him but it did not stop his [Music] the love one he was hanging on the cross after that life that he had lived had been done nothing but good things forgiving the guilty healing the sick and just things that were good but it was less breaths on the cross with the voter mocking spit all them who stood behind from his sacred face he cried with a heart full of love father forgiven amen for they know not what they do he could understand being god he understands that's why he can love us when we're unlovable because he's god and he understands amen lady he loved me never life lived like it because it was wrapped in love dying he saved me a death when in the garden of eden god jehovah required the penalty of sin is death and there could be no alterations it could not be any other way taken care of because god is supreme and he is infinite and the judge of all heavens and earth the penalty of sin is death and there was no one who could pay this penalty for another for every man though he might die for another man but he was guilty to begin with amen it was none of us that could help the other because we were all guilty we are born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and there was not a real hope nowhere we were condemned to death by god and every creature that ever moved on the earth was under this condemnation there could be righteous man rise and do great things but he was a sinner to begin with there was only one way fart to be paid that was the death of god himself so god being a spirit could not die but he came down in a body of flesh and expressed himself and a life of love to take all that goodness that he wants amen and give it willingly as a supreme sacrifice that he might take the guilt the guilty [Music] all of us being sinners are not a way in the world for us to ever be saved he came not only to be seen on earth but he came to die as a sacrifice abel expressed it when he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice and came when he brought the little lamb with a piece of grapevine wrapped around his neck to a rock there laid the little color up on the rock pull his little chin back in with a a rock pounding its little throat and it bleeding and dying and the blood is squirting out this little white locks become bathed with blood able express calvary there when the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world came to take the place of guilty sinners and was mashed and bruised and and scoffed and made fun of and died of death that no creature could die except god himself and his bloody locks hanging from his shoulders dripping to the ground express what a horrible thing that sin is when he had to die to redeem man from a life of sin nothing could die like that nothing could stand that death it said that when they pierced his side that there came forth blood and water it's been some time ago i was speaking to someone about this and it was a scientist that said there is only one way that that could have happened and it was not because of the roman spear that he died and neither wasn't the loss of blood that he died because there was still blood in his body what he died of was not because of the roman spear or the nails that was drove in his hand or the thorny crown they placed on his head but because he died of grief because he came to his own in his own receiving [Music] he died of a broken heart when he knows the very creatures of time that he had done to redeem had spit in his face and he was rejected of man david 800 years before it happened cry of the very voice that he cried at calvary my god why has now forsaken me [Music] what a terrible thing that sin does it separates man from god he was a sin offering that had to be offered for our sins and he was separated from the presence of god sin and separating god placed our sins upon him and he was separated from god and that's why he cried why has thou forsaken me and because he was forsaken and have taken this place and seen his people that he would come to be their savior and to offer them life they had rejected him and he grieved him so tall he was so brokenhearted in terms of blood water the chemicals of his body separated amen man will never know what that was that's the reason there could be no one else could ever die like that i don't care how much that you could be tormented how that they might put your feet in stocks or saw you by inches or burn you by inches you could not die of that death because your makeup's not like that he had to be god he had to be more than man in the faith that god died he died of a broken heart with such grief for the world until a chemical reaction taken place in his body that could not take place in you you cannot suffer like that there's no way for you to have that kind of a grief so there's only one could do it and he did it they're hanging that precious life that knows nothing but love doing good come there between the heavens and the earth lifted up there stripped naked embarrassed think how you'd be stripping naked you were no embarrassment to what god wanted hanging there i know the crucifix has a little thing like they had something around him but they never did that that's just put on the crosser the artist put it there they stripped his clothes from his head on a rope and then tore off of him and gambled for it he was a bad to the utmost let me and god had to stand and sitters spit on his face had to die before the public script naked such a fact it took upon him until it separated the water and the blood no wonder i think the point well expressed it when he said rendering rocks and darkening scars my savior bowed his head and died but the opening they'll reveal the way to heaven's joys and endless days sure you had to do it the veil hung between man and god and that opening veil revealed the way to heaven's joyous and endless day cowardly means something means more than we can express sure living he loved me dying he saved me and buried he carried my sins far away it's been condemned now sin has no more hope when he screamed at the cross it's finished sin died that's dead it's done with it's powerless it's lifeless think of it people that send the enemy to human beings is dead and lifeless it has no more effect it can't one of the sun shut off its vision the stars are not shining the earth turned black is all being redeemed now it's dead it's buried it's lifeless it has no more life that it must be buried what was buried the body of god was buried for it was a sin offering amen it was a burnt lamb it was buried up by the fires of iniquity that sinless lamb that know no sin that god who knows no wrong his life has been given and down buried he carried my sins far away he must be buried the body the sin offering must be buried that's why many after a while will walk one by one to this pool amen to be baptized in the name of jesus christ why something has taken place that spirit that came out of that body when he screamed it's finished has condemned sin in our bodies and we must bury it to be remembered no more i'm so glad that it is when anything's buried his head it's out of sight and buried he carried my sins far away god can see our sins no more for they are buried they are buried where in the sea i forget to listen think of a sea of forgetfulness god cannot remember them no more because they are both dead and buried amen they cannot be remembered no more they're out of god's memory he was also in this very he represented in the old testament they had two they had a sin offering at the cleansing of the sanctuary and that sin offering was that they've taken two goals and one goat was killed and the other goat had the sins that was placed upon the dead goat put up on the live goat remember jesus was a sheep he was a lamb but in this case he become a goat he was righteousness because he was god the sheep but he become a gold sin and it might be the sin offering for me in you from a sheep to a goat and jesus is representing both the animals both goats for one he died he died for the atonement the second the sins from the atonement was put on the scapegoat and the scapegoat took the sins of the people and went far into the wilderness to bear the sins of the people what was it it was the death and the burial of our lord jesus dying living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away he took the sins of the people upon himself and carried them plumbed down into the lowest of hades he was the sin offering he had the sins of the people he died for them and also the sins was placed upon him and he took our sins far away so far that god can never see him no more thank god oh the church can scream hallelujah for such a savior amen not only is our sins forgiven but they are buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more buried he carried our sins far away no more can they be remembered or they are gone they're out of the eyes of god their past they're divorced they're put away god don't remember him no more but the church ought to rejoice this morning to know that our sins will no more be remembered they are put in the sea of forgiveness into the grave of beyond any resurrection they are dead forever and forgotten about they are if they had never happened amen dying he saved me but buried he carried my sins far away he carried them so far until they went into the sea of forgiveness oh we know that those things are most surely believed among us and they're most surely the truth they're god's truth amen all those great things were beyond human expressions we could never express our gratitude for such thing but all that easter rising he justified freely forever living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away that was all right but rising he justified what was that raising up it was god's receipt that the field's been paid rising he justified freely forever what a savior rising what a goddamn a man can suffer a man can die a man can be buried but easter was the greatest of them all for it was god's endorsement amen my laws has been met my requirements has been met that's him rolls him up from the dead i think he just came out freely forever hallelujah amen let it be his holy name hallelujah no wonder it brings emotions no wonder the human heart cannot contain it praise the lord go with our conquering faith we can stand on her and say we're justified forever freely hallelujah because he died and was buried and god raised him up again on easter morning amen yes then god showed that it was accepted all the things that he did everything's freely paid you can [Applause] [Music] in the heavens and heavens the angels sang the praises of god and rejoice of the old testament saints shouted hallelujah hallelujah rising heat justified pray the heavens shut the earth shut paradise shock and hell shut up we got a great voice turned forth back from the grave he arose hallelujah [Music] when we look at that amazing grace younger what he did see god sealed in his horsemen a little while in the world will see me no more yet you see me for all raised from the dead be with you in you to the end of the world as a confirmation and a verification that what god said is true and what i say is truth jesus said i'll come in the form of the holy spirit i will make my bold with you and live with you forever then the saints who has that resurrection hope in their heart can sing this song right and countless morning when the dead in christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection shares amen when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky with the perfect assurance with the seal of god with the red receipt from god himself when the rule is called [Music] he loved me dying he saved me married he carried my sins far away hallelujah oh rising he justified freely forever sins are pardoned all these sacrifices could have been mythical all these sacrifices could have failed but on easter morning when he rose up god proved that he accepted it amen [Music] wondering brings the human heart to a hallelujah no wonder it makes man stand in the face of death make some people call those things which we're not as though they were justified how you'd always raise because he's risen in our hearts 40 days later when he was standing talking to his children [Music] gravitation began to lose its hope the works was finished the penalty was paid he had the receipt in his hand it was god's receipt amen he had the children the church the believers oh sin was conquered the path was made clear he could stay on earth no more what holds us here gravitation gravitation began to break and lost his grips why it's all over then what happened he began to rise from the earth go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature come forth the uttering of his lips go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out evil spirits they shall speak with new tongues if they should take up serpents or drink deadly things it shall not harm them amen if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover because i live gravitations broke away from me sit out i died for you god prove it and give the resurrection receipt because i live you live also someday i will return sunday is coming oh glorious day and one living dying buried rising coming the hope of the church today amen living he loved me

receipt he rose how do you know he lives in my heart he lives in the heart of his believing party think of it friends the food will be ready just in a few moments with warm water for the baptismal service as soon as we return let us bow our heads yesterday i wonder today if there be one in our midst there are many who has not yet appreciated this sacrifice enough to accept it and you would like to be remembered in prayer that god will speak strangely in your heart that you will accept the sacrifice the cleansing of your soul and remember that the day we celebrate just not a time to wear new hats until wear new clothes which is all right it's a symbol of something new god did something new which is all right it's not only that easter doesn't mean that or hunting easter rabbits or bunny eggs and little white chickens and so forth that isn't the hattie brother easter is and remember that today we celebrate just not a time to wear new hats and to wear new clothes which is all right it's a symbol of something new god did something new which is all right it's not only that easter doesn't mean that our hunting easter rabbits are bunny eggs and little white chickens and so forth that isn't the happy brother easter is a triumph it's the victory that god give over the earth that he raised his own son from the dead and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have eternal life the resurrection can be in your own life if you haven't got it would you raise your hand to him this morning while you have your heads bowed said by this god remember that that resurrection life

rising you're justified freely forever and we stand today waiting for your coming god bless them help us we realize we don't have much more time or it's just at the door and any and one hour from now according to the scientists the nations could be no more and we pray god as we stand this easter morning upon the threshold of his coming the hope of the church many thousands are laying out in the dust of the earth waiting for that hour their souls are in the altar crying how long lord how long i pray god that you'll speak to us and let us remember that no matter what we ever do here on earth it's so little and the only thing that we can do now is wait for your cunning and tell everyone the message is urgent may we get it to the people quickly that you may come at any time before these bombs that they're speaking of these missiles that can be showers of thousands of them feel the earth in one minute's time before that happens you promise to come lord [Music] get your people it'll be that way lord so almost any minute there could be a resurrection of easter for the church a resurrection from this sinful life unto the life eternal through christ hear our prayers today as we go on into other services into the sunday school teaching oh lord speak again i may many hearts be strangely warned and may they come by the dozens into this pool this morning this easter morning to be buried with the lord jesus accepting his sacrifice no matter what church they belong to or what religious sect they they have fellowship with that means nothing but have they accepted that sacrifice are they confessing that they're not no good that jesus was the only good one and he died for us and they are still and he took our sins and buried him and we stand alone in him our churches cannot bury our sins our own life cannot bury our sins but christ buried our sins in the sea forgiveness god grant now that these things will be glorious in eyesight and tonight lord may you come in the power of your resurrection and shake this little place like it has never been shaken may signs and wonders appear repeat it like it was a couple sundays ago lord when i'm sick and afflicted was so

this morning and we will be able to give everybody the room to to sing their special i know you all want to express your appreciation to the lord for this resurrection morning amen and so yeah but uh we appreciate you coming we appreciate you having a desire to be able to sing a special for the lord this morning it just had a it took me a while to come up so better colleges when it went ahead singing amen and i show you enjoy it praise the lord at the moment i saw him flying i was looking the ass but ben was talking to me and i was looking i said what is happening is the video having problems but that's brother carly amen amen that's brother cully and we just want to greet all our our visitors if there is any in our case this morning we want to greet them and in the name of the lord jesus uh and we were not able to properly greet brother kali's wife we were asked that she's staying that sister filament there's brother cully's wife [Music] [Applause] [Music] so uh this morning um i got uh two important calls this morning and uh one was a testimony from sister helena there's brother bill's mother and she went for a funeral yesterday and she was supposed to be [Music] with her on her knees and but for some reason the niece felt that she should take her home right after the funeral and then when she when she got home you know i mean that time of the morning i was i was actually up the first call came in i think around four am in the morning so uh when hawk call came in uh i knew it was it was something serious because i thought well if it was anything she she would talk to me after church if you call me that time of the morning then it should be something very serious and i could tell from her voice when i spoke to her and when when she got back home which of course i mean friday night our brother ben preach on many story spirits you know teaching us from the word how uh we are in calm by angels you know when the scripture says the angels of the lord i didn't come about us then that you know uh it is not just a slogan it's a reality and uh and if we would just be prayerful and and and keep our mind on the lord you will hear god speaking to you concerning your everyday life you know i mean the lord can tell you that you're eating too much [Music] it's not a difficult thing for him to do he can tell you well i mean i mean just just skip meal this morning because i want to have a closer fellowship with you it's not a difficult thing he can tell you which clothes to work you know so when she when she accepted the offer to be taken back home in which of course her sister came from out of state for this funeral and she just wanted to spend time with her sister you know but for some reason it needs fear that she should take her back home and when she took her back home when she got home she met her grandson playing with the other little grandson that is a baby and and had a knife in his hands you know something that could have been very horrible you know i believe his sisters were all playing upstairs and didn't even know what was happening but uh i mean the the scene that she described to me was very graphic and it could have been horrible if the lord never had her to step through those doors the meaning that she stepped through those doors i believe he was just the hand of the lord amen amen and the lord used that situation to be able to rescue their home from sharing of blood i mean it's just it's just a child thing that he's playing with his baby brother and you know and i mean i don't want to to go into the rest of faith but uh we want to be grateful that the angel of the law was on the scene to be able to deliver that home from what will have been horrible praise the lord and then got a call from uh sister dokas kamor that that's about pastor john carmon's daughter uh if you remember sometime was that last year or year before but ben and myself we drove down to uh somewhere to iowa there to visit a brother from kenya an elder the minister brother and then his daughter and wife came through the church time here this morning they pleased the law to take our brother home and he went went to sleep he went to be with the law peaceful so we want to pray for the family just spoke to the daughter a couple of minutes ago and she's preparing to go home for her father's funeral so we just want to

celebrate that resurrection power every time we wake in the morning his mercy is new and his mercy is new because of resurrection power resurrection life god bless you good to be in church this morning you may be seated for just a little bit and we certainly appreciate the lord and just want to say how much we appreciate our precious brother juan and the kind invitation of coming this easter weekend and uh it means a lot to me to be able to be here with you folks and uh it's been a long time coming brother blattay's been after me i guess about six years now trying to get the arrangement to get out here and we're just glad that the lord allowed everything to line up all the little lights and stars or whatever you want to say to light up where we could get here but we we thank the lord for the opportunity to come and and uh it has been a wonderful privilege to be here with you i have so enjoyed preaching to you folks i just can't begin to explain brother juan is a blessed blessed individual to get to stand before a group of people like this a couple times a week my goodness my goodness my goodness amen if the rapture takes place anywhere surely it's going to take place right here first before it goes anywhere else i'll tell you what's the truth i mean some of these services the last couple days and i know when i got in the car yesterday went back to the room you know and and um and several meetings like this you know i i may not stand around shake hands quite often during the meetings i try to get back and get right into the bed and rest as much as i can and things and i um i was telling samantha last night she said uh well that went really really really well didn't it and i said well yeah but make the point of saying it's them people that brings that message on like that you know it's hungry saints that bring it out of the preacher it ain't got nothing to do with the preacher himself but i i was blessed i i was laughing friday night i'd hit a little point about women with earrings on and there was a little lady was in here the other night i caught her at the door going out and she had earrings go i said and here i was picking all over you tonight she said it was all right i didn't mind i thought well praise the lord that's all right you know yeah so that was all right goes to prove you can preach truth to people and not everybody gets offended like you think they do if you convey your heart to them that you love them when you're trying to say something you know that that's what gets across and that's what means something to people they want to see something real they want to see something genuine and if you love them they feel it they feel it they sure do and so we appreciate the lord and i i i just i'm so happy to have samantha here with us to do some singing and to have her company and uh it's um uh she's been my my wing woman wingman wing woman she's been about 23 years this coming june and we got married as kids you know the difference is you still look like a kid you still look like you're 19. now me bald-headed how do you put up with me anyways i don't understand but we got married as kids she had just turned 19 i had just turned 21 when we got married and uh we we've been together ever since i actually met her when i was 15 preaching brother carol the first time and i asked her to be my girlfriend and she told me no can you believe that no i stayed mad about three years [Laughter] and then when i come back after she went and her sister helped her hide behind the air conditioning vent she wouldn't even let me talk to her and i thought all right the game is afoot then so i chased her down and i made her mine hallelujah has she been putting me up with putting me up and putting up with me i tell this about samantha's singing i guess almost everywhere i go to people that don't know maybe why we do what we do like that but we of course it's to be a blessing and things but many years ago we were before the minister really come into the full-time capacity we were laying in a bed together just talking about the lord and praying a few things and the prophecy come into the room that said that the lord would take her in her gift and shake it before the world and you know he's done that this little girl right here has not only sang on the internet went around the world that way but she's been in foreign countries with me and sang and been a blessing and things and so i i there was a brother here the other night i think i was telling brother fryho about this brother carol years ago when brother was singing that thanks to calvary the other night you know there's a brother he's going to be with the lord now brother carol buddy tate you all remember buddy so brother carol said they go travel you know and they were going down the road and said they'd be in a church and there wouldn't be nobody clapping their hands they'd be dead as midnight nobody would grab that guitar and sing thanks to calvary they'd be squalling and balling because i could preach for a month after he got done singing that song and i have found that part of what makes the ministry of the lord work for me like it does comes whenever we sit down and sang some songs we just go in these churches it seems like it loosens people up and relaxes them a little while and so i just felt like you know in my life i always wanted to be a singer and be involved in music and sing and i've been a part of quartets and trios and i had an opportunity to go into the big mainstream part of that when i was a teenage boy i used to have a voice a tenor voice at crack glass you sisters think you were high i'd run you a race any day of the week back when i was 19. i could crack glass i was a high high high tenor you know then big quartets that's what they want somebody to get up there and really that that big high tenor like that and i had an opportunity to go out into those things and um the lord started dealing with me as a teenage boy all right forsake all either be a part of that thing or come over here and be a part of the ministry and serve the bride god knowing the desires of my heart that how much i love singing i love doing singing and love playing music that when i got married i had no idea that i'd have my own little gospel group with me and her every time before i preach you know what i mean i say gospel group but you understand what i'm saying my own little version of it i guess so it's a blessing to have her and i'm honored to be able to sing with her and uh i call her the little girl with a big voice amen and she's been a blessing have you enjoyed her yeah amen wonderful praise the lord i i hope this is all right and i don't mean this to sound like a commercial but we we have a a website we have one cd and i don't have a digital version of it we had problems in the studio uh but if you'd like to of course you could you could talk to us about it some other time if you'd like to get one of the cds that we made you can go to that website and you can order one and the reason i tell people this is not to sell it we don't make any money off them things that thing's been paid off some time ago so it's not about making the money of it but uh if you can't afford one and you would like one the whole purpose of me saying this is i want you to let me know if you can't afford one let me know and it's yours and i don't worry about the money of any way whatsoever if you really have a need and you'd like to get one and uh so we'd like to share that with you in that way now i don't expect everybody in here to have a need now but you know but if you did have a need by all means and uh if you would like to get one our website is called the noradsmusic.com the noradsmusic.com you look that up or if you just type in brother ben norod you'll you'll find it down there somewhere or another amen and we'd love to uh let you take us home with you but this is the easiest way it's the cheapest way because if you had to take us home you'd have to feed us and that's a big deal or at least feed me i'll just speak for me love you friends god bless you very much and uh let's uh let's let's sing for a little while how about it appreciate all this good music up here faith i don't where you at girl put your arm up i don't know when i've heard you sing any better than you did last night that was really wonderful [Music] out on the water a storm raging high the waters around them were troubled that night fear filled their heart and they thought that they would die they failed to remember that the master was nigh he spoke the word and the wind all stood still even the waters they obeyed his will he caught the storm now just like he will do mine if i'll just remember that he lives deep inside and why should i worry why should i fear when the very same jesus stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i'll call on his name till the storm passes [Music] we read in the bible how he walked with men he brought light to their darkness when their way grew dim how great it would be to have his step leading mine to walk with the master all of the time but when trials come and death seems so nice i can call on the master he said i'll get there on time and my body is in pain all i have to do lord and why is i worry why should i fear when the very same jesus stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i'll call on his name till the storm passes by why should i worry why should i fear when the very same jesus stays always near he [Music] till the storm passes by [Music] i'll is on his name [Music] till the storm passes by passing yes sir [Applause] i praise her thank you jesus oh blessed be his holy name oh hallelujah how many believes jesus is a waymaker just put your hand up like that one day the sun refused to shine in this sinful life of mine i prayed both night and day that jesus would make our way and one day he heard my prayer and yeah [Music] and [Music] hard and now it's running one day you'll make a way for me [Music] but jesus is the waymaker jesus [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] jesus is a waymaker [Music] [Music] for me [Music] for me for me [Music] praise the lord [Applause] [Music] how many believes what i was preaching last night about the power of prayer [Music] you say i'm not able i'm too young i'm too old i can't sing or preach and no title do i hold what can i do for i want to do my heart and i want to help the hurting with all of my heart i can pray until the walls come down till there's healing all around that's something i can do i can pray in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do i can pray my family shows no interest lord my child she's gone so far see though i tried my best to reach them their hearts seem so hard what can i do lord to bring them back to you my family's lost and dying and my words they don't get through that i can parade yes until the wolves come down [Music] in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do church i can't pray now my friend you may not be a singer you may not be a preacher people may look at you and think ah just a regular old joe they may not think of you as being anything great or anything of notoriety or even reputation but there's one thing that we know by god's word if we are born again and full of the holy ghost all we have to do is open up our hearts and open up our mouths and he promised that while we are yet speaking he would hear from heaven that's right i don't care what you're going through today you can pray if you believe it shout a i can't pray until the walls come down till there's healing all around that's something i can something i can do i can pray in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do i can pray i can pray i [Music] and how many beliefs [Music] praise the lord i love this right here if you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles if you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies if you're trying to fill the same old holes inside there's a better life there's a better life if you've got paint [Music] if you need freedom or saving he's a prison shaken savior if you've got chains he's a chain breaker oh we've all searched for the light of day in the dead of nights we've all found ourselves worn out from the same old fight we've all around the things we know i just stayed right there's a better life there's a better life if you've got pain [Music] you need freedom [Music] he's a chain

and praise the lord amen isn't it wonderful to know he is a chain breaker hallelujah stand with me now if you would and let's get right into the word of god you know what a privilege it is to be a christian today somebody asked me one time they said well brother ben do you believe it's a a privilege to be a believer i said i do i said you mean with all of the troubles and the problems and the things that goes on in a christian's life you mean to tell me that you would actually believe that it's a blessing to be a christian i said well i'll answer you this way and i love how brother branham said this himself when he said in a message called why christ speak he said when faith looks at god's worst it still esteems it better than the best that the devil can offer hallelujah he didn't even look at god's best he said if it was god's worst hallelujah that's right i i believe it with all of my heart all right if you got your bible this morning let's turn to isaiah chapter 14 verse 12. sure appreciate the lord jesus amen how wonderful he is today to us amen you love him and are you happy to be in church now you've already been here a long time i know that already and uh and i know i've been in the bed sleeping while you've been in here worshiping amen but i i don't get no hurry now and if you get tired just stand up and shout amen and hallelujah that'll help you wake up a little bit amen won't hurt you at all i want to speak to you this morning now this may sound like a strange thought for what we would call an easter service but i just kind of felt like the lord had been impressing me to go this direction i want to speak to this morning on the reason satan fell from heaven the reason satan fell from heaven isaiah 14 verse 12 however fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning art thou cut down to the ground which did us weak in the nations thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god which brother brahm tells us is the sons of god of course i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like anybody getting the message yet now there's five wills that satan expresses in this i will i will i will five times just like that notice none of this is to bring glory to god this is all about his desire and what he wants to do i will be like the most high how many he wants to be like jesus amen so does the devil satan wants to be god just like you do right yet thou shalt be brought down to hell he said you want the sides of the north i'm going to give you the sides of the pit remember what jesus said he that exalts himself shall be a beast and then if you go on reading the different parts of these verses you're going to find out that at some point when the devil is when the lord brings satan right before the throne of god and he's exposed before the saints of god it is such a thing that you actually will look at the devil and say is this the man that's right i believe we're kind of getting that message now amen listen to this and god of this evil age brother bryan said it was satan's ambition to be worshipped like god he took two-thirds of the stars of heaven and ascended himself above those stars and preach to them and deceive two-thirds of them you see it all right now notice that's his ambition and now he is ready with his careful selected educated bride by his own knowledge see all painted up in the seat of big buildings big denomination and paints of knowledge and theology smart intellectual and educated to deceive the whole world and become a god and that's what he's done satan is the worship person of today worshiped by millions and billions of people around the world let's pray together lord jesus we are so thankful amen as we come into your presence by the way of our prayers lord we heard last night in thy word what a powerful force that the prayer life of a child of god is fathers we bow our heads to you today we're asking for divine help that you will come into the word of the lord today and that you will quicken it make it alive for us for lord jesus thy letter is but a dead letter until thou anoints it and makes it a living article of life to every one of us and i pray that you'll take your word today and that you will speak to us by that word that you'll anoint me as a giver and anoint them as a receiver lord jesus we can be edified about edified by our gathering together and we pray that the holy spirit will come into this place today and meet every need that is amongst the body of christ for we ask it in the name of jesus christ lord thank you for your easter today thank you for your resurrection in jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated may the lord bless you now don't get nervous i'm only going to preach three hours no big deal no big deal all right we got all afternoon my plane don't leave till 8 o'clock i got plenty of time i want to talk to you just a little bit in the beginning because i want to give you a picture of where i'm going to try to go and um hopefully if i can get to where i'd like to get to i want to try to show you about the great deception of this last day that as we know comes by religion don't forget that every deceitful thing that will be manifested in this last day will come by the medium of religion satan is not a drunk satan is not a scoundrel that uh uh you know this uh his primary objective is is to destroy lives through alcohol whiskey drugs these type of things like that but satan's main objective is to pull people in through the means of religion remember that satan was created to be a religious being and when the devil was first spoke into existence as we looked at friday night about those angels of the lord he was made of such a high quality that brother venom identifies to us that he was everything that god was except for a creator so what was interesting about that particular remark was didn't the devil see whenever god had created him that he had created him with all the same characteristics or the same abilities as what god had minus the creation part and yet somehow that wasn't good enough for the devil and that's a surprising thing in a way you imagine if you was a leader of this nation here and like mr biden if you'd have made vice president sometimes you know for some folks you think well that's good enough i got almost to the top but the way that a person with a certain type of ambition tends to behave is that they they don't really you know want to be just the second in charge or they don't want to be just you know kind of a subordinate to somebody but in their mind they want to be the very top guy the very main one so satan looked at all of the arrangement in heaven and saw that he was always going to be a servant to almighty god he saw that he would always be in the realm and the position of servitude and there was something about that that irritated and rubbed the devil the wrong way because we know that at some point we know because satan was created with free moral agency that at some point there must have been kind of a buzzer or a bell or something clicked inside of it went off and said you know what i'm tired of the way this all looks i'm tired of of the arrangement of this i want to do things my way and i want to call the shots now remember sin itself comes in degrees now you know i know what i'm saying before that satan's not all about whiskey and drugs and these things i know the devil is in those things but it is the difference between his primary objectives and his primary targets versus all the other little things that accompanies his original deception because remember when satan deceived in the very beginning although it was the sexual act that followed along afterwards an immorality between the serpent and eve and even though there was a perversion of the flesh and the body and a hybriding together between the serpent and eve remember that was not the tool that satan used to get to her the tool that he used was in the realm of religion taking what god had said and trying to break that down to her in his own interpretation to say now the lord has said yeah you should eat of every fruit of the tree of the garden but you know eve god is trying to hide something from you he's trying to keep you know a greater purpose from you no doubt that probably was the message that he said to all of them angels when he pulled a third of them out of heaven to be able to say well you know really uh you know god you know he he's got this whole arrangement and and and look at how you are uh like you'd say the angels of the lord would be on a ten point scale uh this certain angel you're just a two but you come join me and you come follow me and i'll make you an eight i'll make you a seven i'll make you this or make you that you know that's the thing about the devil he's always making promises that he never intends to keep he's the type of being that will convince you or talk you into robbing a bank and then call the law on you after you rob it and he never shows the entire picture always remember that the devil will always hold back a portion of what he is thinking of what he is feeling and what he desires after to keep you from understanding what is real motive and objective is i want to say something here right now on a natural side we got a lot of young sisters in here and i see a few brothers scattered around here amen brother one's going to have to start preaching that scripture a man leave father and mother and cling to his wife or y'all ain't going to have nobody after a while all these girls get married off by like manchester we had 12 girls to one boy down there you know but anyhow you know the holy spirit might use this remark that i'm going to make to maybe give you an understanding of how to protect your virtue when it comes and even boys on the other side women can be just as deceitful as man can in this way but you know you take a boy and maybe he starts courting you he'll tell you how beautiful you are and how much better you are than everybody else and you're the only woman for him and he's only got eyes for you and this sort of thing usually if they have the agenda of wanting to uh come together in an intimate manner and that's their only purpose and all of that kind of talk like that you can pretty well pick it out of a crowd almost and tell by the characteristics of it simply because it is always about the flatteries and always about you know the flowery type thing like that this is why the bible said to be careful of flatteries like that not that telling somebody that you know i like the way you're dressed like your shirt like your tie what a great singer what a great musician what a great whatever you might be uh you know i like the way you sow i like the way you cook you know those aren't what the bible would identify as flatteries but flatteries are when they have an agenda for all of those nice words that are coming out of their mouth and they've got an ulterior motive back behind all of those words if you want to marry somebody marry somebody that ain't afraid to disagree with you marry somebody that's not afraid to rub you the wrong way find you somebody that's willing to butt heads with you a little bit well hallelujah because that's the stuff that happy marriages are made of you're not always going to agree one with another you're not always going to see eye to eye and just imagine if you met this boy and he was absolutely perfect and agreed with every word you said you better watch that grasshopper right there [Applause] vice versa boys if she follows you around she's got a shrine built to you in her room and he is the greatest that oh everything he says is right his feet are so cute he smells so good you better run like she's got ebola [Music] amen yes sir i don't care how beautiful she might be i don't care how nice or pretty or whatever it might be there's something wrong with that behavior even the bible tells us steel on steel sharpens your brother amen we're not always going to agree with everything there's always going to be areas in your life when you meet the one that god really has ordained for you they will sometimes sharpen you in ways you didn't know you need to be sharpened that's right amen let me tell you something and some of you boys walking around here that don't know how to hold the door open for some of these sisters around here just get married one time to a good old-fashioned country girl amen the one that's not afraid to bite your kneecaps if it means if the need presents itself and i'll tell you right now if you wasn't raised in a gentleman-like manner to hold the door open for sisters you just let that thing slam on her a few times and find out if you don't hear about it now i'm teasing samantha you know but i i was never raised that way i always hold the door for sisters thing like that but her brother now on the other hand he would go walking through a door and slam right behind right and samantha would tear him limb from them don't you know that's a woman that's a lady open the door you lazy thing poor old chris don't let him hear this message he my buddy amen but it sharpens you it lets you know there are areas of your life where you need to straighten up you say but i don't want to marry nobody like that that's the kind you probably need then you don't need somebody that being a yes man or a yes woman you need somebody that's willing to stand up to you from time to time and tell you that you're wrong and that you need to get the things straightened out that's right oh praise the lord oh i know that runs down into men too whenever they find that sweet little young thing and oh she's so beautiful they're scared to death that she'll run away and leave them so they never correct her they never speak up and never tell her how in the world did i get on this where did this come from oh ulterior motives okay i remember where we was at amen and you understand that there's a reason why that people do the things they do when you know when you buy a house or or you're trying to buy a car watch how nice that salesman is to you if he thinks you've got the money to buy a car just look at him one time and say you can't afford it and watch how much of a knock buddy he is i mean you walk in there and you are flat broke i remember one time we was trying to buy a refrigerator and something had i had great credit i didn't have any issues with credit had the cash at the home to buy the crazy thing but they was going to give me two years without any kind of interest in that i can't i thought i'm going to jump on that we went up to the register and this guy oh man you know i can tell you're an all right guy boy you know your stuff and boy you're smart look at that pretty wife of yours look how handsome oh you're a good happening couple the minute the thing went defunct and then it buzzed back that he couldn't give me the credit he literally turned his back on me and said one of them i figured anyhow ulterior motives that's the way the devil operates he operates in a manner that as long as you're petting the kitty this way yes that's right everything is fine that's right that's how you know brother sister whether you're dealing with a real christian or dealing with a faker because if you want to know if a man or woman is a real believer just rake him with that word one time preach the gospel in a manner and you know how people are well he looked right at me when he said that where am i supposed to look [Music] praise the lord [Applause] i can preach to the drums hey drums get saved but there's nothing in them drums to get saved but you can i figure i might as well preach to you you can watch people when the word gets hot kind of like it did last night some of you were on your feet glory to god then i hit that little part about holding things in your heart and it was so quiet i thought we'd turn into the methodist there for about 10 minutes how about my lord where'd all that pentecost go but you know after the word goes forth and you see it and you begin to repent and you just keep moving on with the lord that is an indication that you are made of stuff that the devil can't run out of here [Music] even jesus tried to offend him he had a bunch of what brother branham called parasites hanging on his ministry and jesus turned and said what would you say if you see the son of man standing here in angels and descending and ascending upon him what did i tell you eat the flesh of the son of man drink his blood and then but did you hear what he said and the whole time the lord jesus is going uh-huh take the bait come on come on take the bait because brother bradham said he knew he had too many following his ministry that wasn't really committed to him they were there for fishes and loaves ulterior motives preachers can have this type of thing in the platform be careful of a man that will preach to you and always have something nice to say better watch a dude like that because if he never willing to offend you then you've got the wrong kind of man in the platform [Music] that's right real preachers aren't afraid to hurt your feelings i mean the real ones not these fakers real ones are not all about the fluff preaching and getting you excited and getting you running around the building sometimes a real man of god digs a deep it grieves him i've been in positions where my flesh was actually i could feel i could feel myself shivering from fear because i was getting so hard with the people and the holy ghost standing and said drive it drive it preach it amen but a real servant of god ain't afraid to butt heads with you from time to time and if you get mad and blow up and run out it goes to prove what was inside of you oh you say well that preacher should be nice to me don't he know how many ties i pay like that's got to do with anything i mean i you know if it was a matter of seniority okay so who started here first who started second uh let's get the list and the unionization down and get everybody on a pecking order and so we'll have church and shifts you know so the main charter members the main ones you know been in the message the longest and those type of people uh you get one type of sermon and then we'll bring the younger ones in they get another type of sermon y'all getting quieter and quieter because you see the word of god is applicable to everybody did you ever notice that the message has no gender the message has no color right the message applies to everybody i'm going somewhere in just a minute but i got to get you there easy going remember when adam was first identified as a sinner in the garden of eden he was a direct descendant from god and when his boy broke that word god looked at him and said get out god never played favorites god had no prejudice it come to the word it was yay and a man or it wasn't yes that's right even his own son he spared no expense he spared no shots no mercy he gave no excuses when adam broke the word of god he said why have you done this thing but satan always makes a way there's always some kind of little hidden agenda to give you a scapegoat and out this is why that politically correct preaching is so popular these days could you imagine the lord jesus standing right now in this day and age preaching the things that he did to the pharisees on an international broadcast with the world listening to him when he turned and looked at a woman and called her a dog you realize that was a racial slur she was a seraphine a hybrid and they called them dogs back then could you imagine what they would have thought about jesus probably the same thing they think about brother brad i'm going to call women dog meat for wearing makeup the message is not politically correct friends nor was it ever intended to be it's a line of demarcation the prophet of god praised good women didn't he he praised sisters that lived right lived holy but when it come to the ones that didn't he made it so straight and so plain that when you read them books and you listen to the message of the hour there is no doubt in your mind which woman is which there's no gray there's no blending there's no well i you know well you know i could be a sister and i could still do dot dot i can be a brother when you read this message you can't do that it is very very transparent oh listen to me church but when the devil begins to preach there's always this air of everybody can do it right now you watch and see if that same denominational trend that you see out in the world has not followed us right here around the ranks of this message that's right everybody is bride if you've got a bunch of books and tapes or whatever more we don't have tapes anymore this day we got our tablets and whatever more and and if you've got an identity of brother branham if you've got an identity with the message you're all right you're on your way to that rapture and you are ready to go same thing that balaam preached we're all one no we're not there are those that are called of god amen with their name on the book before the foundation of the world and there are those that are ordained to hell you say well that's awful strong well what about judas the bible called him the son of perdition before he was even born look that word perditioned up sometime in the original greek you'll find out it's the word hell he was a son of hell before he was even born this is why the prophet said he came from hell and he went back to hell when judas preached the gospel he said the devil preached the gospel when judas got baptized the devil got baptized so it's this religion of we're all the same we all believe the same message shouldn't we all be one at what point does god call separation if we're all the same and all of us are going to the same heaven and this one hates that one and these ain't come on these don't live right these have got every excuse in the world for why they can't live right that's right they barely come to church they paid a tithe in a hundred years i can't afford to pay tithes you can't afford not to god called you to pay those tithes and those offers not because god needs your money but because it is a testament that you will take your portion and give it to god [Music] right he said if you'll do it he'll bless you in a lot of ways he won't bless you and just open bank accounts and pour money in it he'll bless you with peace he'll bless you the prayer life he said i won't allow your leaf to wither nor will it dry up and neither will your fig not cast hallelujah once we follow the program of god the floodgates open up on us so we can bless him and live for him and work like we're supposed to work as christians but how is it satan has been so great at blending together these spirits you said but brother being brother branham said this message would never become an organization you're right the message itself can't the more i study this truth hallelujah the more i just it just keeps unfolding and unfolding and unfolding but you see the message is not the people that follow us [Music] i know you're listening to me i know you're hearing what i'm saying but also be willing to open up your eyes and look around your own ranks and see what's taking place amongst us when you've got people that'll come in and say well do you believe god sent a prophet just raise up your hand ah there's the baptist when they come to a place no more altar calls ah now you got the nazarenes the presbyterians and the rest of them when they want to preach all the word and never preach the blood now you're at the methodist stage denominational spirits and satan has so ordained things and organized things until the devil has slipped right into the ranks of this message and anointed men to preach things to the people that were all one well you believe the message don't you anybody ever ask the devil if he believes it yeah right because he does do you know the devil don't even believe his own trinitarian doctrine he tells people that there are three but the bible said he believes there's one satan don't even believe his own trinitarian doctrine and remember he's not a trinity nor is he a trinity he's one how did the devil get to such a place to where that he could get a foothold on the people around the ranks of this message brother madam teaches us that it is a bride war glory remember what he said about this great clash that come i i love this remark when he's speaking about satan and how that he preached he goes back to ezekiel chapter 28 and he picks up verse 14 when he said thou art the anointed champ now brother you think you've heard good preachers the devil is one of the most charismatic and anointed speakers that you will ever listen to he has got charisma he's got ability he'll capture your attention that's right and you will set mesmerized while you listen at one of satan's ministers you say how can you say such a thing the bible said it paul said that satan could be transformed into the angel of light but he also said if satan's ministers could be transformed also into the apostles of christ there is a true fivefold but there's also imposters in that right if a true teacher will bring you to a true birth then a false teacher will bring you to a false one that's right god i hope somebody's hearing me this is why that we must have the anointing of the holy ghost and discernment of the spirit because the prophet said wisdom versus faith i've seen demons speak in tongues i've seen devils prophesy satan can work every anointed gift that's in the body of christ yeah well i'll just take my bible with him he also said this satan knows the word better than any of us he said he knows it from a to z you think you're going to get into a battle of quotes with such a being as i told you friday night there's a difference in you and i that read it this is a man that stood there when it was being spoken and isaiah said a virgin shall conceive the devil was standing right there listen he has such an ability of deception also watch that he wanted to be so much like god that he took unto him a bride now when you look at this in revelation chapter 17 and you see that great pardon that sisters that great horse standing on sitting on the throne with many waters and so forth beneath her just remember that what you are looking at at one time was a virgin bride a virgin bride to jesus christ that eventually gave her sir womb over to the seed of discrepancy paul said i fear i've espoused you to jesus christ but i fear that satan and his subtility as he did eve why in the world would paul identify eve if she wasn't significant and friends let's just be plain about something eve was guilty of committing adultery not eating some kind of a fruit the punishment shows what kind of crime she committed because when god come down to cursor what did he curse her by in conception and sorrow you'll bring forth if she would have ate some kind of a fruit why didn't god give her a lunch jaw he punished her the area she was guilty in also notice the words of the lord jesus and john standing on the river jordan whenever he goes to talking about those evil pharisees and them demonic spirits that was all bottled up in them evil men of that day watch what he said ah you generation of vipers of all the animals he could have chosen the animal kingdom why a viper why did he say ah you're you generation of chimpanzees right ah your generation of rhinoceros why did he call him vipers because he knew where the original sin had taken place [Music] now paul is making a parallel and showing us glory to god that just as eve gave her womb over to the seat of discrepancy so is it going to happen again amen and so this great woman that john admires with admiration she has become a bride pregnated by satan's seed how do we know that she's received seed from the devil look at what she's producing baptist presbyterian those are blasphemous names identify yourself as even message you better be careful with that because they didn't call message believers at antioch they were called christians at antioch we got to a place where we use that moniker as almost like a tag like a baptist or a methodist or a presbyterian oh i believe the message i didn't ask you that i want to know are you a christian full of the holy ghost [Music] amen so how is the seed of the word sown it is sown to the preaching of the gospel so just as you said here my captive little audience and i'm taking this word of god and i'm preaching and i'm spreading it out like a sower sowing seed out to you and as brother ben taught us your mind is the womb to your spirit as is the womb to your soul and if you receive what i'm telling you and i tell you something that's my idea or my thought you see what kind of trouble i could be in and what kind of condition i can put you in this is why preachers can be the most blessed people or the most dangerous people you'll ever know because once they get influence over an audience poorly old sheep that don't have the ability to discern sometimes between good and evil because a man's got charisma he knows how to kick his leg out and scream at the right moments and get everybody feeling a certain way brother i love all of that i'm a charismatic man myself but you better watch what he's saying about that word no matter how much of a deep teacher they are how many of our people through the years have been deceived by the greatest teachers that we've ever saw grace the field god bless you they know how to speak they know how to hold themselves they know how to gesture just at the right moment send chills down your body oh what a speaker but you better watch brother because if you're sawing that seed of discrepancy in your mind the only thing that will stop it is the grace of god and the seal of god on your soul is the only thing that will keep you from going father amen that's why the elected cannot be deceived because their womb is already stopped up [Music] they cannot receive anything contract they cannot be impregnated by the devil they've already been seed bearing people of the word of god so satan has a war a foot let's turn to second timothy chapter three verse one now i quoted this to you that night but let's look at it again just to get a context of what we're talking about oh praise the lord everybody all right everybody got their shots and their heart pills and hey breakfast my blood sugar doing okay okay okay just check and make sure everybody's all right ii timothy chapter 3 verse 1 i know this is heavy duty stuff but let me tell you something brother this will help us if we listen to it sure it will this know also the last days perilous dangerous times shall come men shall be lovers of their own self watch now covetous boosters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy unthankful where am i seeing that in church oh i don't know holy ghost moving all over the building people shouting praising the lord and some little guys sitting over the corner in the middle of the church or wherever you might be sure they look at you why do you rejoice like you do because i have a spirit of thankfulness on me i'm like that little hog that's been eating apples and i look up to see where the apples come from instead of getting a belly full of not paying attention to it i look up so to you if you're a real worshiper but do you understand why the devil hates your godly worship because he wanted to worship himself do you understand what a slap in the face it is to that enemy yeah whenever you walk into this place and you are you're on your job or where you don't have to be here to worship god and you don't have to just be doing that to worship the lord but do you realize when you live an everyday life of such commitment to the lord that your life is an everyday ongoing spirit of worship and gratefulness and gratitude and thanksgiving and then you come to church in your glory to god and hallelujah and praise the lord don't you know how mad that makes the devil glory there's an old song we sing he's mad and i'm glad and i'm going on with jesus just to say praise heart right traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god oh brother being the world's a bad bunch of people oh don't stop reading having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so they have enough in them that they can identify the godly part but they don't want the power it's kind of like people nowadays they want a turnkey house but they don't want to have to put the work in that it takes to get a turnkey house you know what i mean by turnkey house one of them show houses it's all done up and hardwood flooring and a whole bit people want things they want that nice beautiful you know bmw or whatever it might be they want to pour so they want some great car like that but you're gonna have to put the work in to get that but these people are not interested in such a thing as that because the devil has promised them you'll be all right you just take on a form of godliness now you may not say that directly to him but the message that is being communicated through the ministries that we see going around the ranks of this message telling the people oh just believe the prophet of god you don't need the holy ghost you don't need to be born again why mommy believes for you just push play and obey [Music] do you realize what a satanic spirit that is if pushing play and obeying was all that was ever required then every person that ever reformed would be in the rapture remember as a preacher of the gospel i am not a reformer thank you i am here to bring conversion amen praise the lord somebody yeah i am here to bring conversion to saints of god sons of god daughters of god according to the prophet if i've got the holy ghost i can impart eternal life to you amen how by the preaching of the gospel it's a whole lot easier to conform to something so they learn to catch phrases they learn the one-liners you girls are quit cutting your hair and you're wearing appropriate clothing and you boys you won't wear shorts and you won't be running around big gold chains around your neck and this side and the other like that you know i look like a son of god you'll dress like a son of you come and sit down in church everything will be all right you may even learn how to worship like the rest of us and the devil will tell you you're all right you got the token really what does that mean the token means the literal life of jesus christ you cannot have that without the baptism of the holy ghost oh but my mommy is believing for me my daddy is believing for me you know i had an individual tell me one time well if i can't make it as bright i'll take my chances as foolish virgin i said you're not even fit to be called a foolish virgin that's right because even they seek day and night for the baptism of the holy ghost praise the lord does such a mentality come from this is the reason satan fell from heaven so that he could gather subjects to plant his seed in watch us in second timothy chapter 3 verse 13. now notice again he talks about how that these are the sort which creep into houses and led captives silly women that's not just women in general that's not speaking of just women that's churches captive silly churches churches that aren't established in the truth laden with sins led away with divers lust watches ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth look that word knowledge up sometimes and you'll find out that is an intimate relationship so do they learn the message sure they do every time they come to church they learn a new quote they learn a new fact they learn a new figure they learn a little different way to say it than what they did the day before but if what you are learning does not affect your life directly you are this category of people you are ever learning but never able to come to the true knowledge of the truth now as janice and chambers wish to moses wonder where paul got them words from there are website builders in that day they'd be tearing him all to pieces for that that's right we'll read it in just a moment the bible never even told us what their names were i wonder where paul got it from same one that told him though iron angel preached the gospel any different what you've heard it let him be a curse amen so do these also resist the truth yes but that don't mean that they're not in church so we get this idea in our mind that to be resistant to the truth means they don't go to church you're wrong the third pull remember one phase one attribute of the third pull will be a preaching to those that can never be saved where do y'all think that's going to take place at let us preachers are going to start going down through the back alleys of skid row and finding former church members and trying to get them saved don't you understand that anointing is upon people sitting right in the pew right next to you that instead of moving on to the full baptism of the holy ghost they'll sit right there and resist everything a true man of god tells us and the attitude is sometimes of some vote well i was in this message says before you were born you little smart alec well so was the devil in it before you was born smart alex so where does that put you words amen in case y'all forgot him [Music] there's no such thing as seniority somebody walking around glory to god i've got a piece of brother bradham suitcase i got a piece of his other sleeping bag i got a piece of his god does that matter to anybody i got a piece of the god that brother madam had i walked with him i fished with him i hunted with him so did judas walk with jesus sleep with jesus preach with jesus that's verse 13 but evil men and seducers will get better and better as we go [Music] no no you may not just get worse and worse oh yeah why because it's based on supply and demand if there was no demand for some of these mossback type preachers that just make everybody feel good rather than preach where you live there would be no supply there was no demand there would be no supply of such men around the ranks of this message well you all just ain't going to get into it are you brother ben this makes me nervous it should wake you up wide awake because this is one of the main problems we're facing bride war there's another bride sitting amongst the people of this message and she is impregnated with seat of discrepancy make no mistake she intends to put your lights out look at the way the attitude is already developing no more altar calls you know i was in a message church some time ago and a brother told me we're beyond all that i said there's proof right there you need to be the first one at the altar why would we forbid water if water's there to be baptized that's right amen look at where the nature of the message where the nature of message people look where the nature of them are going they're getting more formal and more quiet and more cold as we go on they're not interested in real godly worship they're not interested and staying all night in prayer meetings and whatever more they're not interested in discussing the word of the lord and true scriptural intercourse of the word they're busy talking about fishing and hunting and some other things exactly the truth and poor little sheep of god sitting there starving to death for a move of god and then some slicker in the pulpit say we're beyond all that we're in the word now well i hear brother branham say that when the word the revelation of the word comes there is a stimulation of revelation [Music] it ought to do something to stir our hearts if the revelation has really struck our heart let me ask you a question on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost come down did they come walking and file in order one behind another the bible said their guts are staggering deep on the holy ghost they got dropped hallelujah to god amen let me tell you brother god wants a drunk church he wants a church so drunk on the holy ghost they don't know what their name is [Applause] not on natural wine of the word but they want it on a spiritual revelation stimulating power that brings them into that place how the devil hates that he wants to be god he wants to be worshiped he wants a bunch of people to worship him the only way that true worship can take place in such a way is in a formal manner now now listen i heard you all clapped during the service now i'm not knocking you off for a clapping but you watch some of our message churches that's all they know how to do now they hear something good they clap in unison just like you would at a ball game or like you would in a movie or a player an opera coming to an end no more do people jump up on their feet and holler glory to god no more do they lay on their face crying out for god in a deeper experience now we've got to this push button thing we hear something good we go nothing against that if you feel led to clap and i know you do but how carried away have we gotten into this formality of worship that's right glory until we get to a place to where we have to do it a certain way and behave a certain way because of course it's being streamed on the internet have you ever saw a facebook and instagram or twitter pic of somebody laying drunk with slobber out of their mouth and said what this is what happened to me at church tonight it don't look too good on facebook praise the lord nobody wants pictures taken like that now you'll take a picture of your apple pie but you won't take it when you was slain drunk on the holy ghost lamb with your mouth hanging open amen preach brother hallelujah amen we've become such a people of culture until every note has to be played exactly every note has to be sung exactly until we've lost that anointing of the spirit where brother benham told us that what god wants in his church listen to me is spontaneous christianity glory not a bunch of push button programmed copycatted religion [Music] preaching glory to god amen i know this is tough stuff look it's not easy for me to say these things but this is the hour we're living in as evangelist i'm supposed to reprove and rebuke with our long suffering and doctrine i am doing what god called me to do this morning if it upsets you i am sorry but i am obeying my call praise the lord do i have permission at this church to preach like an evangelist notice the rising of the sun there has been churches churches and brides brides so there have been more groups than just what we say bride what does that mean bride means she's a spouse and if she is espoused of jesus christ that means she has never went to the full place of that secret chamber with him because remember revelation chapter 19 when the bible said that the wife the wife not the bride the wife half made herself ready notice she couldn't make herself bride but she could make herself ready hallelujah because i never chose myself you didn't choose you amen it was god's own choosing to make me him [Music] [Applause] praise god he said but there must come a real bride imagine this 1965 april of 65 easter weekend of 65. here we are in easter weekend of 2021. yeah and all them years ago brother bannon was looking for a real bride somewhere that was his call you know get a bride for isaac there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it that makes the church live and move in the power of his resurrection amen praise be to god because you realize god is always moving in the beginning the holy spirit moved on the face of the waters god moved on the prophets as it was spoken the whole day god is always in motion when those four living creatures were identified and visioned by ezekiel their wheels were always moving by never moving backwards [Applause] [Music] the bride must always be in motion glory always moving always pressing ahead [Applause] do you know the only thing that stops is a denominational spirit that's what it means they make a nation unto themselves a denomination they form their own laws they form their own rules they form their own but evil men and seducers this word seducer means to be a juggler sure you know how to juggle don't you well if you don't let me teach you okay in order to properly juggle you'll have three or four objects in your hand and you must take the said object and throw it in such a manner circular manner and you must thought in such a way that you only put so much emphasis on one of those objects before you move on to the next one right always going in a motion that never moves you anywhere except for back to the start all over again that's right all right glory to god there go welcome to juggling class today amen i'm going to teach you what to watch for when it comes to the impostors around this message they will be the ones that when they preach the gospel to you they will almost tell you to get born again and then move on to the next subject they will almost tell you what the message really means but keep moving on to the next subject they will almost tell you how to live right but keep on moving to the next subject because you see it affects their offering if they don't do the other right the popularity will be affected yes so they just keep moving on you've seen people like that in your lifetime not just preachers but there are individuals that when you try to really get them face to face with the real issue they'll just okay let's move on that's a juggler he's got to keep things in motion but never moves forward always it turns right back to the same old thing he was in the beginning that's right praise god that's right notice that the bride of jesus christ her shape was not a circle as much as it was a pyramid she just kept moving up [Music] oh i know eternity is a circle yes i get that but when we're talking about the deceivers of the hour they only lay enough emphasis on the truth to keep things in motion that's right let's turn to exodus chapter 7 verse 10 now you got a little time hey i was teasing you about that three hour thing but hey i can hold to that if you want me to hey when i get in the honeypot like this i don't want to quit [Music] action chapter 7 verse 10. thank you jesus and moses and aaron went into pharaoh they did as the lord had commanded aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh before his servants and it became a serpent then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt and they also did in like manner with their enchantments enchantments all right now you don't know this exists okay never heard this before in your life you don't know who moses is you don't know who aaron is you don't know nothing about none of this and you are in egypt right now you're not in minneapolis minnesota you're not in brooklyn heights you're not you're in egypt okay you and i are standing at the sideline pharaoh's on his throne up through the court walks moses and aaron with their sticks in their hand aaron walks up and says let my people go thus saith the lord pharaoh starts into his whole spiel about well you know who is the lord and who is man and such a man i should obey him and on and on and aaron takes his rod and moses throw it down and say thus saith the lord i know you're on the sideline watching all of a sudden here comes the magicians of egypt janice and james paul identifies them and they throw their snake on the ground too which one you going to believe which side do you take now you don't know any of this exists you've never heard this before in your life okay you don't know who moses is except you might have been in egypt when he killed that dead that egyptian out there that dead egyptian you know just a little bit about aaron perhaps but you don't know what they're doing here you haven't seen moses in 40 years maybe some old timers standing on the sideline going wow look how old he's gotten lost all his hair now they throw their rod down and they say thus saith the lord here comes the egyptians doing the same thing from the outside looking in which side do you take come on brother hallelujah all right let's change the scene let's transport back to the 21st century you're in church somebody says and the prophet of god said and everybody goes glory to god well which one's the real bride which one looks like the real true bride remember in the vision the prophet said the wheat jumped up praise god praise all right and the terror done the same thing there was no difference in the external behavior of either one of them but let's read the next verse for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but i love that little three-letter word any good thing you'll read in the scripture that's the word that leads into it for example if you was to take it in the idea of malachi 4 and 5 that god would have smote this earth with a curse and wiped every one of us out and we all would have wound up in hell deserving of hell were captured in the regions of the lost but god sent elijah [Music] amen the world had no idea of the mystery of god john was crying amen nobody worthy to take the book but in the days of the voice of the savior oh yes in the book of ephesians whenever he said some of you were sinners and and liars and whoremongers and truckers god who is rich in mercy [Applause] hallelujah [Music] but aaron's rod swallowed up their rods so the revelation of who was right and who was true blue not so much the right part you understand but more of the idea of the one that god had justified god had sanctioned god had correctly ordained it's not a matter of being right but it's about god putting his rightness in you do you understand me amen so the revelation of who was right did not come at the beginning it didn't come at the middle hallelujah it came at the very end no wonder when the prophet of god saw the preview of the bride why i've always wondered why would god let them two at the end start you know kindly looking around and scooting around and kind of and that voice hollered get back in line did you notice when you hollered get back in line those two young people at the end of the line didn't rebuke him and they didn't get angry at him and they didn't try to correct him they just got right back in step like he told them to do it goes to prove to us at the very end we'll all be influenced by things that'll cause us to look around and stray maybe a little bit but when that voice comes [Music] [Applause] [Music] they'll hear that voice speak and they'll just fall right back in line oh my god i didn't realize i was doing that lord i'm sorry watch us now in the message adoption the prophet said as genesis and jammers withstood moses said well they did pretty near the same thing that moses did until it come into a showdown remember janice and chambridge could bring the plagues but they couldn't take him away all right god is a healer and god's word remains the truth yes amen they could bring the curse but they couldn't remove it i guarantee you brother people that have walked off and left this truth i don't try to throw them under the bus i don't try to throw them in hell i say god bless and make whatever decision they need to make but there's a reason that people all the way up here in this time period begin walking away from this message it's time it's time to defend the crowd the preaching of the words circumstances things that lay before us it's going to thin the crowd out even more and let me tell you something before you become a statistic decide whether you want to give your heart to this or not because the further we get down here to the end it won't just be the devil trying to discourage you out of this it'll be god trying to force you out because the word will get so tough it'll get so razor's edge and so straight that if the righteous scarcely be saved what about the rest of them that's right again israel in the church he said joseph was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver by his brothers the jewish church betrayed joseph today what is it in this church a betrayal they're getting documents he said well now they've got this keep this in your mind they're going to have a confederation of churches that's right he said the churches of america have already begun confederating all their churches together they're going to have a ban with the protestants and the catholics together that'll hook up with catholicism to try to unite together and all those enter denominations that's you if you didn't know who stand for the truth and get away from that dogma they will be persecuted they'll come together he said to put out communism and all of those that stand against this move will be boycotted all right listen to me carefully to boycott someone doesn't necessarily mean you have to be outside with picket signs and the cameras looking at you from msnbc or fox news saying down with this church a bunch of branhamites a bunch of devils a bunch of holy rollers a bunch of whatever a wife can boycott her husband by not showing affection a husband can boycott his wife by not showing affection back to her not providing for her needs a child can boycott its parent by disobedient disobedient and not paying attention and not learning and not you know being over uh just just following the rules you can boycott in many ways for example you can sit right here in this church and if you don't like what me or the juan or some other preacher is preaching you can sit right there and fold up your spirit as same as your arms and decide you're not gonna listen i'm not picking on you for folding arms now but i'm talking about your your spirit in that way amen you can close yourself down that the man of god has no place in you that's boycotting when you come to church and you're closed up and nobody can move you nobody no matter how hot they're playing the song it could be red hot three-quarters and a cloud of dust and you are sitting there shut up shut down shut up and closed off don't you laugh what you're doing you're boycotting the truth praise the lord the prophet of god said in the last day the mark of the beast the persecution will be a boycott against the bride again he said do you realize in the last day it'll be a duel of spirits he said i wasn't going to say this the holy spirit's pressing now he said he realized the bible teaches the last day the two spirits will come to a showdown that's not through some doctrine of churches or something there's some of these folks that run around thinking that the last battle of the last day is going to be a battle of who's got the right doctrine they're all mixed up because it'll be a whole lot closer and a whole lot further down the road than that it'll be so close it would deceive the elected if it was possible praise the lord oh my he said again that's right it'll come to a show that it'll come to the place that the little church has believed the message stood on both feet with her eyes centered to the cross he said it will come to a showdown praise the lord it said no wonder he said when he's counsel of churches he said it's so honeycomb with communistic no wonder they can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they can't believe in divine healing they don't have any message in their heart no matter how hard they're running now do you know what this word communism means communism is a social system that is either governed by a band of leaders or by one dictator so you realize the prophet saying that the churches were honeycombed with communistic well of course they were when brother badam didn't preach it the way they wanted him to preach it what did they do stop attending his meetings spread it out to everybody else don't go to that brother branham's meeting the women would show up with bobbin pins all up in their hair so because the brother venom saw you with short hair they thought he'd preach on them they tell me one pastor down in indiana who was sitting there in los angeles and choosing another bride the higher brother bannon preached against him organized religion the more than people were walking out and the and the brothers said that while they were at the altar screaming and brother brown was prophesying about los angeles they were walking out by the hundreds out of the auditorium that's a boycott what do you think they do today to us modern day ministers when you bring a spirit of the lord on a anointed evangelist or a pastor a teacher apostle or a prophet and they come and they bring the word of the lord and the people sit there and thumb through a song book or thumb through their phone or look at their watch or they study some other thing thinking what in the world am i hearing this stuff again for it's communistic even greater than that when you have a social system around the ranks that if you're not a part of the popular club and the boys club then you're not recognized as one of the ordained ministers i got news for these big guys around the message that think they're such a hot shot and i don't mean big churches i mean these big guys that think they run things and these guys that think that they control the message god will go down into a a ghetto he'll go down into a uh amen into the buckets of the world and he'll raise him up some son of god that anger associated with none of this mess an anointing to preach the gospel and tell the truth amen amen but when you see the people around this message beginning to associate and club themselves together i know people got things in common so they associate together when they've gotten things in common but the prophet of god said if i've got the holy ghost and you've got the holy ghost it should make a tuxedo wrap its arm around a pair of overhauls and love him anyhow even though we realize we're not all the same we are a people of inclusion we allow the holy spirit to welcome anybody in that wants to serve god and later on even brethren talked about the behavior in the churches he said as long as people come to church and behave themselves they're welcome to come right so the great showdown of the last day watch again question answer brother brown speaking of the mark of the beast don't you believe that'll be a tattoo in a head or a number or a hand or something no sir don't you never look for that during quarantine i was absolutely slapping my forehead day after day at the people in this message posting on there that the mark of the beast was an rfid chip or some kind of a little tattoo or they put the mark of the beast in your pfizer shot or your modernist shot or are you going to get the mark of the beast injected into you or it's going to come by some scan on your driver's license don't you know the message any better than that that's what i wanted to say to him that's right that's not the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is simply this it's a rejection of the holy ghost and if the holy ghost is on you with the holy ghost is on me and i'm preaching the truth if you're living the truth and then somebody rejects that [Applause] don't you never look for that it will be a boycott as it was said from some great renowned deal here some years ago that when it come to the real ministry of the last day true ministers of the gospel will see the necessity of playing brother branham's tapes let me tell you something brother god never called me to bring a mechanical device up here and try to get you into the holy ghost god called me to preach the gospel a tape player can't point its finger in your face a tape player can't get down where you're living at right here today i don't say that god couldn't use his word to parallel events in your life and parallel experiences that you've had but god never called mechanical devices to get the bride ready for the rapture i might use a tablet i might use a cell phone i might use all kinds of devices that is just an aid for me when i need to preach i rely upon my my new birth i rely upon the preacher oh hell praise the lord you know we we we love the prophet yes we love the message and any true man of god that's preaching truth he's going to preach a message sure you'll say just like brother brethren said it not draw people after himself say well you better do it like i do it no we do it like what brother brown taught us to do it right and like the bible taught us but notice the world today is gripped by two forces i'm getting really close don't get nervous two great forces coming to a showdown just like it was esau and jacob they represent both these forces came down both had the same father and the same mother glory to god amen in the same womb fussing and fighting and they've been at war with each other ever since right and spoken words you'll see brother said in the latter rain there will come a showdown between jesus and denominations and creeds and when he comes a showdown the rapture of the bride amen so do you want to know the ones that's really going to be spoken for it'll be the ones that they wake up that morning and they're having a bad day kind of like this morning i was i was i was online i was taking care of a few things online and and i was under a time situation and so as i was trying to get through uh some of the classes that i was teaching i had a drink knocked the drink over went all over my phone when all of my papers went everything and i'm trying to do this while i look into the camera and smiling continuing to teach on and on and on this morning and the devil will wake up and start talking to you you're not saved you ain't got the holy ghost you know i've always asked him how do you know what the holy ghost looks like the next time the devil tells you you're not saved ask him this how do you know what save looks like you're not saved you know what he says to me you ain't nothing but serpent seed i always tell him takes one to know what come on amen but the showdown will be between jesus and denominations because the real bride will produce jesus his love his nature his character his revelation his attributes amen will not be a bunch of people that just pack a bunch of quotes in their hand saying brother branham said brother branham said brother brahman said don't you get tired of that let me tell i love to hear this message i get tired of a bunch of guys and all they know how to do is say brother ram said and they don't know how to take me nowhere if you're going to quote this message to me take me somewhere don't just read quotes for quote's sake take me somewhere that's right don't just read the bible to me because it's something we do take me somewhere [Music] some easter sermon huh but i'm trying to show you where we're at because remember this last day bride in resurrection in easter if you want to tie it together like that sure be fine when she comes to the place where she recognizes that god has vested his entire voice and authority in her remember what he said that she these sons of god will step out and take every power of the devil's got back from him right amen that's what he said whenever we come to rapture time and we talk about the third pool can i hit one thing before we go everybody okay you know in mark 11 he talked about a mountain speak to a mountain right now for some of us have been in this thing for a while i want to talk to you a minute about something the prophet of god said that he prayed that he would never come to a place of having a crabbit old spirit that's right remember he didn't want to be crowned with a complaining type spirit he makes a statement like this perfect strength my perfect weakness if you want to look it up 11 18 61 the prophet of god said like this he said experiences accumulate sometimes you can't help for these things to affect you but for you and i that are in this message you know some of the greatest victories going to be for you and i to be able to live through every adulterous preacher through every backslidden church member through every persecution through everybody that this one left the message and that one done this and this one proved this and that one didn't prove that and then to continue coming into the doors and set down on the pew with all them experiences in front of you and speak to that mountain of experiences and say get behind me yes if you want to know what real third pull power looks like in your life it's being able to look at all of the deception and all of the lies and all of the cheating and all of the backbiting that you've had to endure as a christian and to be able to speak to that stuff and say get out of my way you are not going to influence [Applause] should i clap or should i not clap friend that wasn't the point what i'm trying to say it's the program worship i'm talking about we don't want to get into a program place where we have a certain routine god hates a routine like that don't get your stuff stuck in a routine that's right i tell people you come to church you're used to putting up your right arm put that left one up for a while if you drop this way jump the other way for a little while break it up yourself do something different if you're saying glory glory glory come to church say amen amen amen watch the nominations watch them on the television and watch some of these internet programs when john hagee hits his high point out there in that san antonio tabernacle watching people they know right when they clap nothing spontaneous about it it's programmed they follow the inspiration of it anyhow i've done made that point to you but all of these accumulation of experiences how many people have you been in this message and you crossed paths with that have hated you back bit you lied on you said things about you caused all kinds of manners of evil to come into your life and yet you're sitting here right now why because when a mountain is set before you you have the ability by that great spoken word faith to be able to look at that mountain and say i'm not going to let that experience stop me [Music] [Applause] i'll remind you of this one thing as a close when brother branham come down toward the end of his life look at some of the battles if you study that part of brother brown's life study those attributes and those little nuances in brother graham's life toward the end watch him you hear him talk about putting the cross up because he wanted to keep his eyes off women and you hear him talking about the battles with preachers out there and how they wanted to preach but he comes down to those last couple of years and listen at him i got in a complex because i thought people didn't want to hear me you know a lot of them things were produced by the 30 years of experience brother branham had of people defending him hurting him lying on him stepping on him and saying all manners of thing on him and when he got down here at the very end the real mountain that he had to face was that mountain of experiences that lay before him all the time hallelujah and he said he had to go through the parking lot he said look through the license plate see people driving from all over the country and said he'd put that back on the devil and say well what about that if they don't want to hear me what about all those look at the battles he faced at the end he thought people didn't want to hear what he had to say oh i would that god would let me know if this was right or not but i would love to know how brother branham may feel about it now if god ever look him pat let him look past the curtain of time i wonder would the lord ever let him just be able to look down maybe through some kind of a spiritual telescope and look now look at them all over africa and india new zealand and australia and around the different parts of the world all through central and south america all through north america all through russia and all those countries up there like that the very man that come to the very end of his days and got to thinking nobody wanted to hear what he had to say and those were the very messages that so positioned us that we call it the opening of the word again and yet that was the battle he faced at the end let me tell you something brother the reason satan fell from heaven is because he wanted to take control of everything that god had you are the greatest hindrance that satan will ever have because out of everything he can control in this world he cannot control you and i thank you [Applause] [Music] that's why i say thank you jesus he cannot control my hands they will worship the lord he cannot control my feet they will worship the lord he will not control my voice or my breath or my strength or my mind or my soul or my body they will serve the lord as for me and my house [Applause] [Music] not a house made with two by fours and nails but my house i will serve we will serve it's a bride war the last thing you and i will experience is a war between these two groups church formal church spiritual that's exactly the truth you ever had that feeling being in an assembly when you really worship the lord for some of you that like to worship and you really like to get out there and demonstrative and you like to worship the lord you ever go to an assembly and maybe as you're worshiping or meeting or some kind of thing and you feel that pressure come behind you almost like quit stop don't do that quit singing so exuberant shut that down do you know what that is that's that boycott spirit that's the reason why when you feel it you should be like the prophet stop making tapes i'm making more [Music] [Applause] man [Applause] i learned one thing a long time ago if i come into a place and i find out they don't like the way i preach and the way i worship and they don't like all that i just get that much hotter i figure well i'm in trouble already so just get in there not to be stubborn not to be rude or mean but to make a point this is my inheritance of god this is my land the prophet said it's not a geographic location our land [Music] you see i keep preaching because you keep pulling so so i'm ignoring you now we're done i'm not preaching anymore stop stop it [Applause] [Music] be to hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh friends don't you love the lord jesus it has been a real honor and privilege to be here with you glory i come for the purpose of encouraging you but you all have encouraged me it's meetings like this to keep me going preaching to folks like you that make me take another step hallelujah thank you lord thank you thank you for not letting a boycott an old dirty denominational spirit stop [Music] do you have your problems like the rest of us do you have your battles like the rest of us do you have your issues like the rest of us sure sure none of us are perfect we all have our ups and downs but oh what a promise yes sir and he said it's not he that begins the race not at the beginning not even in the middle yes but it's he at the end of it you want to know whether you got the goods or not i started to tell you this when the old devil is telling you you're not saved and you're not going to be ready there you are standing before the mirror and you're looking at your wrinkles coming in the hair going out and you're thinking man i'm getting old and this that and the other all of a sudden a sharp pain goes and there you are standing looking in the mirror the 19 year old boy again and you disappear with the vanish of the twinkling of an eye you know what brother i have waited my entire life to be able to say this to the devil brother scott i've wanted to say this to him since i've been 14 years old now you see me now you don't [Music] [Applause] the showdown will come and god will speak [Applause] did you know in the book of thessalonians when he talks about the lord descending when he talks about the voice of the resurrection do you know that word voice has a very familiar term to you and i when you look it up in the greek word i'll spell it for you p-h-o-n-e so when he comes to the voice of the resurrection if i'm connected up to the royal telephone satan will be beating the time out of me and i'll just walk away from him where do you think you're going i got a phone call to answer [Music] not everybody will get that call brother not everybody will have the experience they won't all be hooked up but one day this bride will receive a phone call come on home and i shall go praise the lord don't worry friend if they don't know who you are they will after a while think of what he said and go on beyond the camp he said think of it missing people on the earth a good friend of mine down in tennessee used to say this all the time he said you going to walmart and you see those those those photographs on their missing child i'm missing a matter of one of these days i'll probably be up there [Music] they'll be searching where'd ben go where'd ben go now you see me [Music] oh hallelujah praise the lord
