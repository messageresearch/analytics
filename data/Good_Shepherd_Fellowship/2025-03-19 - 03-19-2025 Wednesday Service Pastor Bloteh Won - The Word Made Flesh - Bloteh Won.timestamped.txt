[42:59] Hernandez and uh uh and his wife uh
[43:02] sister W that the Lord uh will also be
[43:07] with
[43:08] him now so tonight we I just want to go
[43:11] back to uh what we were sharing with you
[43:14] last week on the word may flesh I want
[43:16] to pick up from there but uh uh uh it
[43:21] was good to have brother William
[43:22] visiting with us and uh uh on
[43:26] Sunday and he was uh uh speaking on uh
[43:32] on the
[43:33] subject if uh uh don't lose your crown
[43:36] you know don't lose your
[43:38] crown uh I don't know if I'm prior
[43:41] personing or I'm T in the right but that
[43:44] was the thought that he was uh talking
[43:47] on and I was just sharing with him while
[43:50] we were uh driving together after the
[43:53] service and uh uh uh and i' I will have
[43:58] read that quote after service but
[44:02] because of the worship the atmosphere
[44:04] and the way the service ended I didn't
[44:07] want it to bring you out of worship to
[44:09] preach to you again before we go back
[44:12] into worship so I just thought okay I
[44:14] would just leave it for another time but
[44:17] I would love to share that with you and
[44:20] uh uh if uh our sister will share it
[44:23] with us I just want to read there before
[44:25] we go into what we want to
[44:27] we want to read tonight and it it kind
[44:30] of bring uh a different way that you
[44:33] will see uh What uh uh in the way that
[44:36] brother Brandon put it here tonight and
[44:39] uh
[44:40] uh you see a lot of things as uh uh as a
[44:45] people when we read the Bible and uh you
[44:48] know we read the promises we can only
[44:52] associate we can associate uh the bible
[44:55] promises of internal life and things
[44:57] that will happen in heaven we can only
[45:00] associate with things that we know on
[45:02] Earth so when we talk about uh wearing a
[45:08] crown uh uh you know we we wear the Rob
[45:12] and Crown you know when the battle over
[45:15] you know we shall wear the crown you
[45:17] know when when we think about that the
[45:20] only way we can be able to to make sense
[45:23] of it is to think about how we wear
[45:26] Crown in his life amen Paul will do the
[45:29] same thing when he talk about running a
[45:32] race he's talking about our life you
[45:35] know activity and the thing that we do
[45:37] every day he's comparing there to you
[45:40] know athletes that are running the race
[45:42] when two men is running the race you
[45:44] know Paul would do that we know our
[45:47] physical race is there I'm not running
[45:49] against you brother shedra neither you
[45:51] know running the G Sy now me but uh uh I
[45:55] mean we all are running to together amen
[45:58] we are running together and uh uh uh but
[46:02] that is the way we can associate it so
[46:04] let's let's just read this together
[46:06] tonight and then uh we will stand for
[46:08] the reading of the word he says no
[46:10] wonder then Paul could say with that
[46:14] real hope rooted and grounded in him
[46:17] like this m when he got down to the end
[46:22] of the road he said I have fought a good
[46:25] fight I have finished the ca I have kept
[46:28] the faith henceforth there is lay up for
[46:33] me a crown of
[46:35] righteousness that the Lord the
[46:38] righteous judge will give me at that day
[46:42] not only me but all that love his
[46:45] appearance amen the righteous judge will
[46:49] give us you know a crown of
[46:51] righteousness then he go along again he
[46:53] says when you are sick and
[46:57] tried and and and tired of this old life
[47:01] and you will love the appearing of the
[47:05] Lord Jesus better than you
[47:08] love your fool at the table or you love
[47:12] your wife or your children then there's
[47:17] a crown lay up for
[47:20] you not a crown a gold crown to put upon
[47:25] your head so you see the Crown of Life
[47:30] the crown of righteousness and and and
[47:33] all the crowns the promises of crowns in
[47:36] the Bible they are not a gold crown that
[47:40] is going to be put on our
[47:43] head no but you see every time we think
[47:46] about it we think about it that way that
[47:49] in heaven we all have crowns on our
[47:52] heads and we be walking around you know
[47:55] with with with Golden Crown and and
[47:57] white RS on our head that's the way we
[48:00] think about it but see the way the
[48:02] prophet is going to help us to
[48:04] understand it he said but a
[48:08] b free from
[48:11] pains amen so God is crowning you the
[48:17] crown of
[48:18] righteousness is is he's putting
[48:20] righteousness upon you you're going to
[48:24] be crowned in that way where you will be
[48:27] free from
[48:28] sin the Crown of Life is that he's going
[48:32] to Crown you with life that you won't
[48:35] die
[48:39] again praise the
[48:42] Lord amen it's not the one where you put
[48:45] it on your head in the morning and then
[48:47] in the in the night before you go to bed
[48:49] you take it up and put it right at your
[48:51] your light your your lampstand you know
[48:54] beside your bed and in the morning you
[48:56] get up and put on your head you know you
[48:58] you you go you brush your teeth and take
[49:01] bath and and then you wear your clothes
[49:03] then you set your crown on your head no
[49:05] you're going to be wearing
[49:08] it praise the Lord now you have to think
[49:12] about it this
[49:14] way that Crown is also associated with
[49:20] reward praise the Lord amen at the
[49:24] builded contest the reward the queen
[49:27] with a
[49:30] crown so you got to think about it this
[49:33] way that the word Crown is placed there
[49:39] to be able to give you a sense of
[49:44] reward are we
[49:46] together amen and now if you remember
[49:49] that we we spoke about that uh uh some
[49:52] time ago and uh uh we talk on
[49:57] uh
[49:59] uh uh different crowns uh rewards of
[50:03] crowns if you if you remember that
[50:05] talking about that some time
[50:12] ago we spoke on the rewards of
[50:15] crown uh you you you will see over in uh
[50:21] uh proverb chap 12:4 wife as crowned
[50:25] unto her husband
[50:27] he does not wear her on her on his
[50:30] head but he she's a crown which mean
[50:34] she's a she she's a reward you know
[50:37] she's uh the next thing that brother
[50:39] Brandon would say that that God will
[50:40] give a man after salvation is a good
[50:43] wife so he Crown he crowned him with a
[50:47] good wife are we together
[51:02] and uh in uh uh Philippian and also in
[51:05] tesalon Paul talk about a crown of
[51:09] rejoicing praise the Lord he crowned us
[51:14] with a Garment of Praise a crown of
[51:17] rejoicing is a life God has rewarded you
[51:21] it's almost like H H Sarah she named
[51:26] Isaac
[51:29] laughter amen praise the Lord because
[51:33] now after all the sorrow that she went
[51:36] through and all the waiting for this
[51:38] child now she can
[51:41] laugh you know so God Crown us with
[51:46] rejoicing we might be broke but we are
[51:49] happy
[51:55] amen there's a Crown of
[51:57] Glory and brother Brandon will say it in
[52:00] the in the Philadelphia Church a what is
[52:02] a crown he says a crown means you have a
[52:07] domain you are like a king if you are
[52:10] crown and we are sons of God when we are
[52:13] crowned with internal life we are
[52:16] crowned with internal
[52:19] life it's placed upon us we are wearing
[52:23] it not only on our head but is running
[52:27] through our
[52:28] veins are we together praise the Lord so
[52:32] you see when you take into context what
[52:35] our brother was speaking about and and
[52:37] and you you don't want to lose your
[52:39] crown because uh uh you know your the
[52:42] trial that you are going through there
[52:44] is a
[52:45] reward praise the Lord amen there is a
[52:49] reward like like Paul says the light
[52:52] reflection that we are going through
[52:54] here can never be compared to the
[52:56] internal
[52:58] reward okay so no matter what we are
[53:00] going through in this life is so light
[53:04] and he said the weight of internal
[53:08] reward praise the Lord so you you can
[53:11] just think about that you think about
[53:14] that I mean that's one of the thing that
[53:16] would make Heaven A surprising place
[53:18] because what we have in our mind as
[53:21] humans here when we get there it will be
[53:24] completely different praise the Lord L
[53:27] it was going to be completely different
[53:29] we found out that we were thousand miles
[53:31] away from what God was thinking in his
[53:34] mind as the heaven is higher than the
[53:36] earth so are his thoughts higher than
[53:38] ours the Lord bless you tonight let's
[53:40] stand on our feet and then we can go
[53:42] into what we want to talk about tonight

[53:47] you praise the
[53:49] Lord amen

[55:57] way it looks like we will have seven
[56:00] different Crown you know you one day you
[56:02] wear the crown of righteousness and then
[56:04] you put it down then the next day you
[56:05] wear the crown of rejoicing you put it

[56:21] uh as we continue to to enjoy the word
[56:26] word I want to read something tonight
[56:28] from uh invisible Union that's where I
[56:31] want to go with my continuation tonight
[56:34] invisible Union the prophet of God will
[56:37] says here and Jesus the word took my
[56:42] place he become
[56:45] me that a
[56:47] sinner that I might become him the
[56:51] word praise the Lord he become me
[56:56] there a sinner that I might become him
[56:59] the word amen let me hold truth to it
[57:04] not the church let me hold truth to the
[57:08] word amen praise the Lord he says all
[57:13] that spiritual union of Christ and his
[57:19] church
[57:21] now when the flesh is becoming word
[57:27] and the word is becoming
[57:30] flesh manifested Vindicated I want to
[57:34] read that again all that spiritual union
[57:38] of Christ and his church praise the Lord
[57:43] now you read about the marriage of the
[57:45] Lamb that's another
[57:47] subject I got I got into to think about
[57:50] that uh because I heard uh uh a brother
[57:53] was trying to present uh uh the the the
[57:57] marriage ceremony of the bride and and
[58:00] and and the groom and I think he took a
[58:03] cot but he uh uh uh he was trying to use
[58:07] that to show that the marriage takes
[58:10] place right after uh uh the Rapture when
[58:14] we meet in the
[58:15] air praise the Lord and uh uh uh uh I
[58:21] don't think I don't think that's that's
[58:23] the way it it actually happens because
[58:27] the marriage takes place
[58:29] year when we leave we are going on our
[58:32] honeymoon amen praise the lord we are we
[58:36] are heading out uh on our honeymoon you
[58:39] see just like after you do the wedding
[58:41] they leave every one of you standing up
[58:43] and then they get in their car and they
[58:45] just drive away and and you know go to
[58:49] take pictures and then uh we meet them
[58:52] over to the reception hall that's that's
[58:54] what is going to be
[58:56] so listen to this again oh that
[59:00] spiritual union of Christ and his
[59:07] church
[59:08] now when the when the flesh is becoming
[59:12] word and the word is becoming flesh
[59:16] manifested
[59:18] Vindicated just what the Bible said will
[59:22] happen in this
[59:24] day amen
[59:27] Jesus said in that
[59:29] day you will know that I'm in the Father
[59:33] the father in me I in you and you in me
[59:39] amen Christ is the Myster of God reveal
[59:42] he says is this
[59:44] day amen is this day at the opening of
[59:48] the
[59:50] word
[59:51] hallelujah amen the word does not become
[59:55] flesh when we go to
[59:57] heaven praise the Lord the word becomes
[1:00:00] flesh while we are year the word become
[1:00:04] flesh in that invisible
[1:00:08] Union praise the Lord in that invisible
[1:00:12] Union that's the marriage of the
[1:00:16] lamb in that invisible
[1:00:21] Union
[1:00:24] Hallelujah there are some things that I
[1:00:26] want to say they are sticking on my
[1:00:29] tongue it's sticking on my
[1:00:34] tongue all that spiritual union of
[1:00:37] Christ and his church now when the flesh
[1:00:41] is becoming word and the word is
[1:00:44] becoming
[1:00:46] flesh are we
[1:00:49] together manifested Vindicated just what
[1:00:53] the Bible said will happen in this day
[1:00:56] is happening day by day it's happening
[1:01:01] how did he say it it's happening day by
[1:01:05] day so every day the word is becoming
[1:01:10] flesh it's happening day by
[1:01:15] day are we together you have to remember
[1:01:19] now it's in that invisible Union it's
[1:01:23] not in an individual practicing religion
[1:01:27] no it's in that invisible Union and what
[1:01:30] is the invisible Union Christ the word
[1:01:34] and the bride uniting
[1:01:39] together praise the
[1:01:41] Lord Christ and the the the bride Christ
[1:01:46] and the individual uniting together is
[1:01:49] the word made
[1:01:51] flesh are we together
[1:01:58] when was the first time that the word
[1:02:00] was made
[1:02:02] flesh can anybody thr it out to me when
[1:02:06] was the first
[1:02:09] time
[1:02:10] amen when was the first time that the
[1:02:13] word was made flesh in
[1:02:17] Adam in Christ the word was made flesh
[1:02:20] in its
[1:02:24] fullness and are we
[1:02:26] together amen now so you have to see
[1:02:30] that Paul I mean John is bringing this
[1:02:33] from the beginning in the beginning was
[1:02:36] the
[1:02:39] word amen he's bringing it from the
[1:02:42] beginning in the beginning was the word
[1:02:45] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:02:48] was
[1:02:50] God praise the
[1:02:52] Lord amen so when he comes to the place
[1:02:56] and make us to know and the Word was
[1:02:59] made flesh and dwell Among Us that was
[1:03:02] not the first
[1:03:05] time no that was not the first time are
[1:03:09] we
[1:03:12] together that was not the first
[1:03:15] time see what uh the prophet of God who
[1:03:19] says here in the in the in spoken word
[1:03:22] is the Original
[1:03:23] Seed see what he was said he says uh
[1:03:27] that's the reason that God could work
[1:03:30] his work through
[1:03:32] Jesus he he was the predestinated son so
[1:03:37] Jesus was also predestinated just like
[1:03:40] you were
[1:03:43] predestinated amen Jesus was elected
[1:03:47] just like you were
[1:03:50] elected he was forn by the father just
[1:03:53] like we were forn by the father
[1:03:57] are we
[1:03:58] together amen so now see what he's
[1:04:02] saying here look people this is the
[1:04:04] message of the hour this is the word
[1:04:07] that is giving us for us to be
[1:04:10] transformed this is the invisible Union
[1:04:12] of the
[1:04:13] Bride praise the
[1:04:22] Lord he said that's the reason that God
[1:04:25] God could work his work through Jesus
[1:04:29] because he was predestinated so God can
[1:04:32] also work his work through a bride
[1:04:35] because the bride is predestinated God
[1:04:37] could work through Joseph because Joseph
[1:04:40] was predestinated God could work through
[1:04:43] David because David was predestinated
[1:04:46] and every time that God choose a body to
[1:04:49] work through is the word made flesh
[1:04:56] are we together praise the
[1:04:59] Lord amen all we want to leave the word
[1:05:03] may flesh only in
[1:05:05] Jesus you can do it but that's not what
[1:05:08] God is doing amen you can do it because
[1:05:13] that's the way the church teach it but
[1:05:16] that's not what God is doing are we
[1:05:19] together God could work his work through
[1:05:22] Jesus he was predestined he was the
[1:05:25] predes destinated Son of God he was the
[1:05:27] lamb Sling from the foundation of the
[1:05:30] word before a 100 billion trillion
[1:05:34] million years ago that we said Genesis 1
[1:05:38] spoke of a while ago he was right then
[1:05:44] predestinated to take his place amen
[1:05:47] that's the reason the will of the father
[1:05:51] he
[1:05:51] did he was the word made manifest first
[1:05:56] amen the reason why he could do the will
[1:06:00] of the father not my will but your will
[1:06:03] be done praise the Lord the same way
[1:06:07] Jesus said that you can say it I can say
[1:06:10] it and his will will be
[1:06:14] done are we together because he was a
[1:06:17] predestinated
[1:06:20] son and every one of the other Sons will
[1:06:26] have the same
[1:06:28] manifestation what is that manifestation
[1:06:31] the word made
[1:06:33] flesh
[1:06:35] amen when it is God helping you to get
[1:06:39] over your temper is the word made
[1:06:42] flesh if if if the Lord helping you to
[1:06:46] to get over your greed is the word made
[1:06:49] flesh are we
[1:06:52] together if if you are not the one
[1:06:54] practicing religion but is the word that
[1:06:56] is doing it in you and every one of the
[1:06:59] other Sons will have the same
[1:07:01] manifestation and that's the ones that
[1:07:05] was
[1:07:07] predestinated
[1:07:09] amen that little group in every
[1:07:14] generation will come up in the
[1:07:18] resurrection all the way from the
[1:07:21] beginning of the word the little group
[1:07:24] in every every generation right from the
[1:07:27] beginning of the word
[1:07:30] hallelujah are we
[1:07:36] together and the reason they hold onto
[1:07:39] it even Paul spoke of it in in re in
[1:07:43] Hebrew 11 said they wander about in
[1:07:46] sheep's King and goats King and were
[1:07:48] destined to Afflicted to medit of whom
[1:07:51] this world was now waled of Amen had not
[1:07:55] nothing to eat they run about they du
[1:07:58] out persecuted they were saw aand like
[1:08:02] like
[1:08:02] aai was and many other Paul speaking of
[1:08:06] them men who was he so asand asaiah the
[1:08:11] prophet predestinated even before the
[1:08:14] foundation of the word he should have
[1:08:17] come through the womb of Eve but then he
[1:08:21] came through the womb of a woman his
[1:08:24] Spirit had to come year to be a witness
[1:08:28] are we together now listen to this now
[1:08:32] so Jesus was also came for a witness of
[1:08:38] the death burial and
[1:08:40] Resurrection are we together so what was
[1:08:44] Jesus witnessing death burier and
[1:08:48] Resurrection are we
[1:08:51] together that man will die but live
[1:08:55] again through him for he is the seed
[1:09:00] that has that has to come up amen hope
[1:09:04] you see it all right predestinated as he
[1:09:09] was makes the word seed flesh in
[1:09:15] you
[1:09:17] amen predestinated as Jesus word if you
[1:09:21] are predestinated as Jesus was
[1:09:26] it makes the wor see flesh in you his
[1:09:29] church his word are we together praise
[1:09:34] the Lord so you see uh uh uh I mean
[1:09:38] that's that's where we are coming to you
[1:09:40] see that is the reason why uh uh you
[1:09:43] know uh we we we have been taught to to
[1:09:46] be conscious of our less we have to be
[1:09:50] conscious of where God took us from we
[1:09:52] have to be conscious of what he's doing
[1:09:55] in our life and every day the reason why
[1:09:58] we prayed and brother brandom said that
[1:10:01] was the same reason why Jesus prayed is
[1:10:04] because he was subjecting this sisting
[1:10:07] element to the spirit amen that was in
[1:10:12] Him Praise the Lord amen we are
[1:10:16] subjecting this 15 ele this 16 element
[1:10:19] this body that we have that is tempted
[1:10:21] all the time this body that we have that
[1:10:24] that that that can never be redeemed we
[1:10:27] have to subject it all the time every
[1:10:30] day every
[1:10:41] day you have to you have to realize that
[1:10:45] uh there is no sinless Perfection every
[1:10:47] day you have to
[1:10:49] fight amen there is there is there is
[1:10:53] never the time you will come to the
[1:10:54] place where
[1:10:55] I mean uh uh uh the the word is over and
[1:10:59] you lay down your sword or you lay down
[1:11:01] your spear no it it will not happen not
[1:11:04] in this life amen we start fighting
[1:11:07] right from the womb to the
[1:11:11] Grave praise the Lord right from the
[1:11:14] womb to the Grave we start we we we
[1:11:17] fight we fight our way every way every
[1:11:24] day are we
[1:11:32] together look at what he said in while
[1:11:35] we are that organized religion born
[1:11:37] again from above then
[1:11:40] we we are active active in the things
[1:11:45] from above and for his life is in you
[1:11:49] which is the
[1:11:51] word
[1:11:53] venting the word is
[1:11:55] self the spirit that's in you is the
[1:11:59] word made flesh in
[1:12:02] you the spirit that's in you is the word
[1:12:07] made flesh in you there is no there is
[1:12:10] no clearer way to say
[1:12:12] it amen praise the Lord I know when
[1:12:17] you're born again and then you go you
[1:12:19] you you Justified and then you
[1:12:21] Sanctified and then you you filled with
[1:12:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:12:24] the the Holy Ghost himself I mean we can
[1:12:26] go through all that rout but his spirit
[1:12:29] in you is the word made flesh in
[1:12:33] you praise the
[1:12:35] Lord so what are we talking about from
[1:12:38] word to
[1:12:41] flesh amen from word to
[1:12:48] flesh when he expressed himself in the
[1:12:51] beginning it was the word the logos the
[1:12:55] thought of God praise the Lord amen the
[1:13:00] spirit being of
[1:13:02] God now leaving from that form to a
[1:13:06] visible form where we can identify
[1:13:10] him are we together the word may flesh
[1:13:15] from word to
[1:13:17] flesh all between year is a
[1:13:21] process amen all between year is it's a
[1:13:26] process but from word to flesh it's
[1:13:28] almost like when Jesus Took the water
[1:13:31] from Water to
[1:13:35] Wine there is a
[1:13:38] process to make wine for you to have
[1:13:42] wine there has to be
[1:13:45] fermentation amen praise the Lord so God
[1:13:49] is taking us through the
[1:13:52] process of leaving word to flesh
[1:13:56] are we
[1:14:02] together that's the reason why you have
[1:14:04] to be patient with yourself the spirit
[1:14:07] that's in you is the word made flesh in
[1:14:10] you the spirit Minds the
[1:14:13] word and is active in vindicating the
[1:14:17] word that's the only reason the Holy
[1:14:21] Ghost was given is to make the word late
[1:14:26] praise the Lord amen the Holy Ghost was
[1:14:30] given to make the word
[1:14:42] live another thought here this is a
[1:14:45] Wednesday night so let's let's uh let's
[1:14:48] let's take this one from influence God
[1:14:51] can do without you he can do without
[1:14:56] me but we can do without him praise the
[1:15:01] Lord can we say Amen is that truth to
[1:15:04] you praise the Lord is that truth to you
[1:15:08] amen God can do without
[1:15:13] you he can do without me praise the Lord
[1:15:17] if I'm not yet one of these days the
[1:15:20] work of God is still going to go on
[1:15:23] praise the Lord he can do without me he
[1:15:27] can do without you but we dare not try
[1:15:30] to do without him praise the lord we
[1:15:33] need him every day can we say amen amen
[1:15:37] we need him every day we have got to
[1:15:40] have him for he is life and he
[1:15:44] alone not to know his book not to know
[1:15:48] the message not to know this or to know
[1:15:51] that or to know a Creed but to know him
[1:15:55] him is
[1:15:56] life know him as a
[1:15:59] person Christ in you the word made flesh
[1:16:04] in
[1:16:05] you praise the Lord when you say I'm
[1:16:09] it's no longer I that live it but Christ
[1:16:13] is just not an idea what you are saying
[1:16:16] to somebody is I'm the word made
[1:16:19] flesh praise the Lord I'm the word may
[1:16:23] flesh world you say that is a bold
[1:16:25] statement I mean it would be difficult
[1:16:27] for people to believe it they couldn't
[1:16:29] even believe that Jesus was the word
[1:16:31] made
[1:16:32] flesh praise the lord it's only the elit
[1:16:35] that can believe that Jesus was the word
[1:16:37] made flesh they call him Jesus the son
[1:16:40] of
[1:16:42] Joseph Jesus the son of Joseph called
[1:16:45] the Son of
[1:16:46] God praise the
[1:16:48] Lord it was a very big argument in the
[1:16:52] Reformation they just could not except
[1:16:55] that he was the son of God they did not
[1:16:58] believe he was the word made
[1:17:01] flesh are we
[1:17:06] together that that is God that is God's
[1:17:09] uh h h h uh that that is his uh uh uh uh
[1:17:14] uh uh his his his Higher Achievement you
[1:17:17] know was was to become
[1:17:21] flesh that was his Higher Achievement
[1:17:24] that was that was what his
[1:17:26] desire that's what he was Desiring if if
[1:17:29] you look here you will see that uh uh uh
[1:17:33] over and over the Lord told the children
[1:17:35] of Israel you go back you go back in in
[1:17:39] in in the in the scripture you will see
[1:17:42] here the Bible use
[1:17:45] uh the Bible use this word the word was
[1:17:49] made flesh
[1:17:52] ured amen PR praise the Lord when he
[1:17:56] told Moses to build a tabernacle what
[1:17:59] was the purpose because I want to come
[1:18:02] and
[1:18:04] dwell amen so you see all behind the Old
[1:18:09] Testament times it was this thought of
[1:18:13] God becoming
[1:18:15] flesh praise the Lord amen all behind
[1:18:20] the reason why Solomon built the
[1:18:22] Tabernacle and it said when that when
[1:18:25] everything was in its place and
[1:18:27] everything and the music and everything
[1:18:29] was right the the the glory of the Lord
[1:18:32] came down to do what to do
[1:18:36] it amen to
[1:18:44] do he not coming just to to come to come
[1:18:48] down and then go away no he's coming to
[1:18:51] do
[1:18:53] it are we to
[1:18:56] together he's coming to D so you see
[1:18:59] that is the
[1:19:03] thought that is the thought for him to
[1:19:06] dwell in
[1:19:08] US make a pinent dwelling in his
[1:19:13] people let's look at few few uh uh
[1:19:16] scripture here Leviticus 2611
[1:19:21] quickly Leviticus 2611
[1:19:30] praise the
[1:19:35] Lord and I will set my Tabernacle among
[1:19:40] you and my soul shall
[1:19:44] not hurt you amen praise the Lord
[1:19:59] if you read uh uh uh uh Psalm chapter 68
[1:20:03] look at Psalm chapter 68 let's look at
[1:20:05] Verse 18 if we just as we as we just
[1:20:09] want to just look a few verses tonight
[1:20:12] the Bible says Thou H has ascended on
[1:20:16] high and thou Hast LED captivity
[1:20:20] captive thou thou has received gift for
[1:20:24] many
[1:20:25] and yet for the rebellious also that the
[1:20:30] Lord might dwell among them now brother
[1:20:33] Brandon will use the scripture and let
[1:20:35] us know that was the importance of the
[1:20:38] Ascension the reason why he ascended of
[1:20:41] high was to to to to deal with uh you
[1:20:45] know H H Le to lead captivity captive to
[1:20:49] all all of the the the you know uh the
[1:20:53] the demon power the prin IP ality uh uh
[1:20:56] that was all hovering over men and he
[1:20:59] says once again to set up Jacob's laad
[1:21:02] uh I mean so sons of God can be able to
[1:21:05] run to the throne of God and and come
[1:21:07] down we can say like Jesus said the son
[1:21:10] of man which is in heaven and he's on
[1:21:12] Earth because I mean that's what the new
[1:21:15] birth brings to us amen praise the lord
[1:21:19] we we are right now we are in Heavenly
[1:21:21] places even though we are sitting right
[1:21:24] here in Ling Center in this building on
[1:21:26] humble Avenue but our spirit is lifted
[1:21:29] up in Heavenly places praise the Lord
[1:21:33] hallelujah amen and I mean if you real
[1:21:37] in the spirit tonight you can run up
[1:21:39] Jacob's Ladder and run into heaven grab
[1:21:41] something and bring it
[1:21:45] down that's the reason why all things
[1:21:48] are possible to them that
[1:21:51] believe are we together praise the
[1:21:56] Lord so you see that's that that is
[1:21:59] God's
[1:22:00] desire you know this this Holy Ghost is
[1:22:03] not just a thought it's not just a
[1:22:06] sensation it's not a good feeling praise
[1:22:09] the Lord his desire is to dwell with
[1:22:15] us amen is to dwell with us
[1:22:28] Hallelujah the word may
[1:22:31] flesh the word and that's word word it
[1:22:37] stumble people and that's where we also
[1:22:39] struggle with because the word is not
[1:22:42] taking on uh uh Celestial body one day
[1:22:46] it will take on Celestial body one day
[1:22:49] if death should hit me while I'm on this
[1:22:52] Pulpit the word is going to move me from
[1:22:55] this terrestrial body and send me over
[1:22:57] to a celestrial body is going to be the
[1:23:00] word that will do that because the word
[1:23:03] always want to be in
[1:23:06] flesh amen so the word is going to leave
[1:23:10] from this h h h a terrestrial body and
[1:23:13] move over to a Celestial body praise the
[1:23:16] Lord are we together
[1:23:21] amen but because we are in a a
[1:23:24] terrestrial body a a a a body of mistake
[1:23:28] a body of struggle with Mortal
[1:23:31] conditions you know uh uh age and
[1:23:33] sickness and different things we we we
[1:23:36] stumble at the thought of the world
[1:23:39] becoming your
[1:23:40] flesh we stumble at the thought of
[1:23:44] it are we
[1:23:49] together but that is the purpose of the
[1:23:51] word is to be made flesh listen today
[1:23:55] the the Great and Mighty conqueror then
[1:23:57] he said he came down because he was in
[1:24:00] the beginning the Bible said he was the
[1:24:02] word he was the logos that went out of
[1:24:06] God and that logos in the beginning was
[1:24:10] the word and he became the word and when
[1:24:14] he ascended
[1:24:16] up on that glorious day of Easter he
[1:24:22] becomes not only the word
[1:24:25] but he becomes the high priest of his
[1:24:29] own
[1:24:31] word praise the Lord he becomes the high
[1:24:35] priest of his own word that's the reason
[1:24:39] why if you tell him his word he will
[1:24:41] perform
[1:24:43] it he's not the high priest of your
[1:24:47] feelings now the high priest of your
[1:24:49] thought he's the high priest of his word
[1:24:53] he ascend of high and he became the high
[1:24:56] priest of of his own word oh what a
[1:24:59] glorious thing brother Nel think of it
[1:25:02] he's not only the word but he is the
[1:25:05] high priest of his own word
[1:25:09] he how could we doubt it how could we
[1:25:13] walk to him and not believe that we
[1:25:18] receive what we ask he he is the high
[1:25:22] priest of his own word The God That Make
[1:25:25] This Promise is he's the same one that
[1:25:28] we speak his promise to he's the same
[1:25:30] one that is going to fulfill his
[1:25:37] promise are we
[1:25:43] together how could we walk to him and I
[1:25:46] believe that we will receive what we ask
[1:25:48] for fall he is the word and the
[1:25:52] intercessor of the word
[1:25:55] amen he makes Advocate upon his own word
[1:26:00] are we
[1:26:02] together the lers became word and the
[1:26:06] word made flesh and the same flesh that
[1:26:11] was the word receed up into glory and
[1:26:14] now is the high priest making
[1:26:17] intercession by himself to his word
[1:26:24] that's what it
[1:26:25] takes that's the material that the
[1:26:28] church has got what a
[1:26:31] weapon there there has never been one
[1:26:34] like
[1:26:35] it he was the word and when he and when
[1:26:40] he comes he was born in the manger he
[1:26:44] come to use the weapon of love love to
[1:26:49] conquer the word amen not with with with
[1:26:54] armor bullets n with machine guns or
[1:26:58] tank but he comes in a different manner
[1:27:02] he comes in the form of love he was
[1:27:05] God's
[1:27:06] love praise the
[1:27:09] Lord
[1:27:11] hallelujah
[1:27:13] amen you see when we uh uh truth we are
[1:27:17] all we are all sinners uh H are saved by
[1:27:20] grace that's that's that is that is just
[1:27:23] truth that is our birth that's how we
[1:27:25] were all we were all born in sin sh in
[1:27:28] iniquity praise the Lord but you see the
[1:27:31] more you come to the realization that
[1:27:34] the purpose of which God brought you on
[1:27:37] the earth which he predestinated you to
[1:27:40] be in this age the more that becomes
[1:27:42] real to you is for him to inhabit your
[1:27:46] body praise the Lord amen the more that
[1:27:51] becomes real you see that thought it has
[1:27:54] a magnectic force in it the more the
[1:27:57] thought becomes real to you the more it
[1:27:59] draw you closer to God the more it takes
[1:28:03] you away from the things of the word but
[1:28:06] when the thought I'm just a sinner saved
[1:28:08] by grace amen and that is the only thing
[1:28:12] you can see of yourself just a sin not
[1:28:14] saved by grace there is no magnectic
[1:28:17] power in there to move you closer to to
[1:28:19] to righteousness all you can do cry to
[1:28:22] God for Mercy oh Lord have mercy upon me
[1:28:25] oh God forgive me I'm just a sinner
[1:28:27] saved by grace yeah you are just a
[1:28:29] sinner saved by grace but the reason why
[1:28:31] God brought a sinner saved by grace is
[1:28:34] to be able to redeem that body draw that
[1:28:38] body closer to him endure it in their
[1:28:41] body praise the
[1:28:44] Lord so we must go from siners Saved By
[1:28:47] Grace to Sons and Daughters of
[1:28:51] God predestinated to be to be able to
[1:28:55] manifest the word the the promise of God
[1:28:58] for this age are we
[1:29:01] together all that spiritual union of
[1:29:04] Christ and his church now when the
[1:29:08] word is becoming flesh and the flesh is
[1:29:12] becoming
[1:29:14] word
[1:29:16] amen that is the spiritual
[1:29:18] union that is the invisible Union amen
[1:29:23] the invisible ible Union that is going
[1:29:25] on is the word becoming flesh and the
[1:29:29] flesh becoming word you see that is that
[1:29:33] is the tough thing that is in
[1:29:36] marriage that is the tough that is in
[1:29:38] marriage the two becoming one that's how
[1:29:41] that's how it takes place that's the
[1:29:43] reason why it gets hard for us it looks
[1:29:46] like we have been tried beyond measure
[1:29:49] no your flesh is becoming wor amen amen
[1:29:54] praise the Lord he might take you
[1:29:55] through the fire he might take you
[1:29:57] through the flood he might take you
[1:29:59] through great trials none of them are
[1:30:01] going to consume you the only thing they
[1:30:04] can bring out of you is the word may
[1:30:08] flesh praise the Lord you see when that
[1:30:11] when that when that Union is going on
[1:30:14] when that Union is going on that's that
[1:30:17] is some of the things that cause
[1:30:19] friction but our human mind don't
[1:30:22] understand it even in our relationship
[1:30:24] we don't understand it we take it on
[1:30:27] this person and and and we take it on
[1:30:29] that person but the reality there is
[1:30:32] that God that that that established the
[1:30:35] Institute of Marriage he allowed that
[1:30:40] Amen to be able to bring to bring forth
[1:30:44] that Oneness it's nothing about the
[1:30:46] person it's nothing about me it's
[1:30:48] nothing about you it's about what he's
[1:30:50] doing
[1:30:54] praise the
[1:30:57] Lord the moment we can look beyond
[1:31:01] that the easier the the the whatever is
[1:31:04] going on becomes for
[1:31:06] us but the thing about it is that we we
[1:31:09] are not able to look beyond our
[1:31:12] flesh praise the lord we are not able to
[1:31:16] look when the Bible says the light AFF
[1:31:18] flection we are going through h h a
[1:31:20] sickness or going through some kind of a
[1:31:22] trial if you just look beyond the flesh
[1:31:25] you will see the glory that
[1:31:29] awaits but if you cannot look beyond the
[1:31:32] flesh you will get tired I can't make it
[1:31:34] I can't take it it's all because you are
[1:31:38] you are not looking too far from your
[1:31:42] nose I can't take it it's too hard I I
[1:31:46] mean why me it's all because you're
[1:31:49] looking right here you are not looking
[1:31:52] Beyond
[1:31:55] praise the Lord
[1:31:59] amen so that's what is happening here in
[1:32:02] this spiritual union in this h h h
[1:32:05] spiritual invisible
[1:32:08] Union it's an invisible Union can you
[1:32:13] imagine it's an invisible Union and he's
[1:32:16] using invisible
[1:32:19] things to perfect
[1:32:21] Us Praise the Lord
[1:32:26] are we
[1:32:31] together all that spiritual union of
[1:32:35] Christ and his
[1:32:37] church when the flesh is becoming word
[1:32:41] and the word is becoming flesh that's
[1:32:45] what is going on now when you take on
[1:32:48] the name of Jesus and you stand right in
[1:32:51] that in that uh uh uh h a pool to be
[1:32:54] baptized and you smiling and all your
[1:32:57] cheeks is up it's just like the Welling
[1:32:59] day you are smiling you know everybody
[1:33:01] looking at you you're in your white
[1:33:03] garment and and you're in your B TI is
[1:33:05] it's it's
[1:33:07] pretty praise the
[1:33:11] Lord but the
[1:33:13] union the wedding the wedding the
[1:33:17] melting the bounding starts when we get
[1:33:22] out of that place amen
[1:33:24] when the
