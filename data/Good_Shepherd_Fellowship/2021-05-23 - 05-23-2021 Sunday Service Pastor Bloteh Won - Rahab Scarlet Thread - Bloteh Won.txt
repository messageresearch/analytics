healing and then after after that we had a visiting minister and um i don't remember his name because i'm terrible with names but um he was talking about how he when he was believing for healing for himself he wrote on his um i think it was his mirror that by his stripes i was healed or something like that so then i put that on my phone so that every time i open my phone i have to see that and so

sparkling water which is usually my go-to um the thought came to me just drink regular water which is like before that would be a nightmare for me to just have i have a very um rough relationship with

just we just want to thank the lord for all the testimony all the prayers the songs signed this morning and we are so grateful for what the lord is doing in the life of his children amen praise the lord one of the one of the things they have affected modern christianity is the lack of answer to prayers and it's not because that god do not answer prayer is because people have shipped their mind to be able to design design how their prayers should be answered and because uh you know god don't work by him of mine and his thoughts are determined from the foundation of the world so even if he brings it to pass and they are not thinking about it that way and so then they believe that god is not answering their prayers but he said prayer answering god amen you either tell you you should wait on him or he says no or he says yes and all of those ones are answers as well praise the lord so we just want to thank the lord we want to thank the lord and be grateful to the lord this morning now uh early this morning uh a dear sister called me and she's not been feeling well and uh she just you know called me this morning because uh uh she kind of fulfilled that the lord you know witnessed to her uh you know of of his mercy and uh for some reason she's i mean she kind of her mistaking it over those are not overdosed but she took a pill that that had an ingredient that she's allergic to so it started increasing not only the back pains that she had but it was almost like suffocating her and because she was struggling with her breathing and so she said she woke up in the morning she prayed and just asked the lord to give her a uh give her sleep for her to be able to rest because she had not been able to sleep over a couple of days so she said that just in in that moment of time she had a she just doors up into a little sleep and it's almost like she got an experience that that didn't leave her even when she woke up and she she find herself what would look like you know on uh on the other side of time and uh and she said uh you know uh it was it was like she was up a hill going down and from the from uh from the lower part of the hill coming up uh she saw our good friend brother maron and she says i saw brother mira just like a teenage boy and and he was running running up the hill to me and then suddenly i woke up and she says the feeling just left for me and you know she called me and crying on the phone and uh you know and she just felt that you know the lord kind of a witness to her you know that there's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet

praise god praise god yes praise god oh praise god praise [Music] praise god [Music] is [Music] praise god [Music] thank you [Music] you know there was something that uh the lord been dealing with my hat on and uh wednesday night we closed the service and we were worshiping the little baby and what actually it is is that uh the other day we was preaching here and talking about what god can do through a praying mother or the praying wife than the man in the pulpit [Music] and i was we were reading what brother branham shared and and the holy spirit kind of struck my heart that morning it was not something that was on my note but then uh which of course is what the prophet of god said but it kind of uh became a revelation that morning that uh uh the virtue of the the power of the woman is in her virtue and the thought never leave left my mind since uh the lord kind of for there with my heart on there because there is a lot of there that is also applied to the church the power of the church is not in ramping the people it's not in making the people emotional no it's what god has already installed when we start to appreciate the sacrifice that god has given to us then power will start to come to the church now so as i was meditating on that uh the lord started dealing with my hiding you know and and just kind of for showing different things to me and you see in in the in the marriage covey then the bible says that the man you know must love his wife just like christ loved the church but if you realize it you will see that brother branham said in the church in the church ages he says that uh uh that uh the object you know of of god's love you know uh uh is his bride that we we are the object of his love the expression of his love but you see the thing about it there is that this great god that is that is so loving he is a very fountain of love but [Music] being the fountain of love is so amazing sometimes it's so amazing in your mind you don't know how to say it that's how i feel being the fountain of love the lord bless you just sit down a little bit let's keep worshiping and uh being the fountain of love [Music] god had to made us for us to love him praise the lord think about it this way and that's word many times we we uh we we misunderstand you know some of the things that god placed in his word you always hear people fuss about this it's uh you know the first and it says the other uh uh [Music] you know uh most especially in carpool about you know the man which is the bible says the woman she referenced her husband and a woman says the bible says the man should love his wife now we have to realize that when it comes to the the lot of redemption just like we said you know showing from the word of god that god placed you know this law to govern the universe there is this law that he placed in the woman with the sacrifice that's the reason why he had to shut the heavens he had to shut the heavens the angels went quiet adam was in the deep sleep the animals didn't know anything of what god was doing when he took a rape from the side of adam to made a woman it was so dear to god because through that his attributes will be made known so he placed this thing in the woman they sacrifice you and uh and in in making her that way he made her a weaker vessel now when the fall came he gave the woman a promise of redemption the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent so you see there are a lot of things that are playing out here and what i wanted to bring to you is that uh it's it's those things are installed in the woman just like it is in the church now the woman is the object the church is the object of his love even though he's the great fountain of love but if he have never allowed us to come into a worst take for him to be able to step out of his glory to come in and identify himself with us we would have never known what love is and and that portion of his attribute would have never been expressed so you see the thing about it did is the other the man christ jesus oh the man the husband is supposed to love his wife but you see the thing that is that emotion many times you know a man like i said love is an action word a man comes very short of having a true action and expression of love praise the lord just like how god make the church the expression or the object of his love and that is the same way he placed that thing in the woman now god so loved the word that's what the scripture says that he sent his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish you see god sent his son he expresses love but when you look at it it looks like it's cruel praise the lord the greater expression of love that he will come and pay for my sin and your sin but yet it was expressed in a cruel way are you grabbing the sense i'm saying praise the lord now you see like you says uh you say you you tell a man especially on a wedding day you say greet your greet your bride he stepped forward he lived for the villa he just kissed him praise the lord amen well if if it was the woman that was giving that privilege oh man she would lay her head on his shoulder what because it's in her it's in her are you understanding what i'm saying am i making sense to you it's in her praise the law so you see loving god in as much as he has loved us and has expressed his love by paying for our sin and our iniquity when it comes to the expression of love it takes a people whose hearts are touched whose lives are changed that we can be able to look back and see where the grace of god took us from and the things that he had done in our life praise the lord oh i mean loving god is worth it's not loving god in just a word or a statement i love you the church has the truth expression of love we know how to lift our hands we know how to worship him we know how to lay our head on his chest and we can cry and we can praise god i mean that's what i'm talking about making love with god you have a church today that says lord jesus i love you that's all we know how to say i love you we don't have we don't have deep expression we don't have half that expression we can sing praise god and we're not even praising god in our minds we are just singing it because the music is playing and we are thinking about something completely different praise the lord amen oh i'm telling you it's in the woman she knows how to make love more than the man praise the lord so you see the mystery there is that the man is commanded to love his wife but the mystery there is that love is in a woman for her to teach her husband that is the mystery she's supposed to bring him to that place but the problem there is that there is a commandment man love your wife so what what happening there is that the woman stayed back and she said but the bible said you should love me the love that i should give you is in you [Music] oh my goodness the great fountain of love the god that loved the whole world [Music] that's what a new birth is praise the lord this great internal spirit he's been there all this why he don't know how to love himself [Music] but he redeemed a people and pulled them to himself and put his love in their heart so you can love him for god to feel his love it has to come from you praise the lord [Music] listen to our faith let's sing their chorus again and then we will turn to the preaching of the word praise god praise god praise god i thank you lord i praise you lord i love you praise god praise god oh praise god [Music] oh praise god [Music] yes please god praise god [Music] love you lord i wanna thank you lord praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god it's also like the scripture says a woman must reference a husband if almighty god did not humble himself down if he did not humble himself from his glory there is no way we could reference him praise the lord there is no way we could reference him it's the way that god became one of us to bring us to the place where we are him [Music] praise the lord take his man pharaoh that's why brother branham says the man must live such a life before his wife what life is dead not a life of rulership and command a life of humbleness praise the lord let's read the scripture this morning because i don't even know what i'm reading from but let's take our bibles we have a whole boat fort here so we can just take one ah praise the lord glory be to god oh praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah let's go to the book of judges this morning i'm going to keep you in suspense of what we were talking about wednesday night and i'm going to run over here and just and touch something that uh so dear to my heart i look at this subject for many years now many many years and i think the lord kept us you know uh uh now to talk about it until now that would be uh joshua chapter two we'll read a little bit on the on our dear sister rahab amen praise the lord rehab chapter 2 trying to together okay let's let's just read uh uh reading from verse 10. rehab chapter 2 reading from verse 10. okay okay joshua chapter 2 praise the lord we're writing a new book here praise the lord amen we're writing a new book here the book of rahab oh my god glory be to god amen amen i know she's just being on the curtain of time and she says yeah that should have been my book she says thank you brother juan you put me into the scripture praise the lord joshua chapter 2 let's read from verse 10. you can see where my mind was so oh my mind has been through the night for we have heard how the lord dry up the water of the red sea for you this is rehab testimony when when he came out of egypt and what he did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan uh shayhon and ark womb here utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our heart did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in the earth beneath praise the lord when we heard these things our heart melt now before the the the spies got there i might start preaching here the lord bless you have your seat have your seat because i'm already into my message now before the spies got there god bless you brother one thank you before they got there see what she testified god has started dealing with her heart praise the lord whether it was in the newspaper that she read about the red sea whether it was in the the media of that day that she heard how the kings of amorites were overcome she's testifying when we heard these things our hearts melt praise the lord amen have you ever read something on the news that moved your heart maybe it's uh it was an accident or maybe uh an adoption you know uh someone adopted a child uh uh you know a story like that and it just move your heart and sometimes it move your heart and move you to tears now you you would just think that uh sometimes it's just a story that you have read but if you are uh one that is that is sensitive to the holy spirit dealing with you you will see how god will use that story and he will start to show you things in your own life praise the lord amen and sometimes you will move it from the natural to the spiritual you you realize that just by hearing those things she's making it general we heard about it our heart moved because everybody was talking about it the generals were talking about it it came on the news in one sense she was expressing that we have such a fear but we know because she was an illet god was using those story to prepare her heart because she was an illeg what was on the news what was in the newspaper whatever they said about israel drying up the red sea overcoming the kings of amara god was using that to wave down to that predestinated seed in her spirit because as soon as she saw those men yeah this was a man a connection started coming that she could not put together she could not put together she just thought well what we have heard we are afraid you know these guys overcome the other nation they're my overcomers she's looking at that in the sense of a kind of fear but it is a reference fear that god starts to quicken in her heart are we together the way that god we convict a man is only in his design only god knows what he will use to change a man is owned to his design we can have our church doctrine we can have our church rules we can have our regulation god don't need it you keep it it's good for you but he don't need it he can use the singing of a song praise the lord he can use the appearance the order of a people in church if someone can say wow god is in that place what god will use to get a man is only his design praise the lord and that's the reason why we don't preach to impress anybody amen because it's all in his design as soon as we heard these things our heart did melt praise the lord neither did there remain animal courage in any man because of you all over the street people were talking about it we saw some of our military even resigning from the army when he heard how can you fight an army that opened the red sea how can you fight him praise the lord this we we shoot our satellite to see what kind of ammunition they have they don't have ammunition but they are overcoming kings the police department down the road just closed because every one of them ran to their village i'm bringing you breaking news i'm bringing you breaking news amen it's rahab testified for the lord your god he is god yeah you think about it great testimony but look at the life of this woman she's holding those things in her heart and she just slept with a man last night that was not her husband it was two or three men she slept with but she's holding in her heart and she's testifying with her lips something that we we are we are nervous to do praise the lord oh i like when the lord does things like this amen is god in heaven above in the air beneath now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shown you kindness that year will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token praise the lord and that year will save you will save a life my father my mother my brethren is my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and the man answered her [Music] our life for yours greater love no greater love love no man jesus said than for one man to lay down his life for another but this time it was a woman that was laying down her life for them a type of the sacrificial love just as how christ laid down his life he will get a redeemed people call his bride that will be able to lay down their life in prayer and supplication in seeing others better than ourselves we will lay down our life for others our life for yours you know what that means a whole army coming against these people that's capital punishment for rahab praise the lord for her to be able to launch spies they were going to grab her grab her father house everyone that is associated with her they're going to kill them so this is not this is not cheap business this is a very expensive business a business world you are putting your life on the line it's a very expensive business this is not a cheap business and the man answered her our life for yours if if you alternet this our business and it shall be when the lord have given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by a call through the window of a house for her house was upon the town wall and she dwarfed upon the wall now living upon the wall of the city was a very expensive place it was almost like buying the house by the lake praise the lord so you can see something is making me to sneeze here praise the lord are we together amen so you can see that this was just not a woman this was a woman that could have just continued her lifestyle because she was doing well to buy a house on the walls of the city it's not a ghetto because every house on the wall of the city represent the city it represent the beauty of the city so this was not a broken home this was a woman that was doing very well she had expensive things in her home because she was living an expensive life are we together and she said unto them giving to the mountains this is what i want for us to pay attention to now get into the mountains please the pursuer meets you and hide yourself there three days three days on the line that word three days oh praise the lord what almighty god we serve amen three days you notice that in the bible genesis the third day is the day of life amen genesis chapter one the third day is the day of life and because of that the jews always do their wedding on the tv because they believe there is a day of life the marriage in canada was on the teddy praise the lord no one of jesus rose on the tear day because it's the day of life but let's keep with this until the pursuit be returned and afterwards ye afterward may you go your way and the man said unto her we will be blameless of this thine odds which thou have made us to swear behold when we come into the land thou shalt bound this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou has let us down by you understanding the language there now wish they have let us from which they have let us down bar the very same trade you let us down with that's why you should hang to your window are we together the same thing that saved him would be the same thing that would save her [Laughter] oh my goodness the same thing that saved him will be the same thing oh my goodness oh my goodness that's the reason why peter said unto the philippian jailer believe the lord jesus christ ye in your household shall be saved praise the lord amen brother branham says the same faith that save you will be the same faith that will save your household if you can just keep it together glory be to god it was met it was not uh uh the the the the spies giving her a rope she provided that was her fate she provided praise the lord oh my goodness are we together i'm telling you i don't like i encourage you young people you can never understand appreciate this message of the hour until you learn to read your bible sometimes we think that we need to know the message for us to understand our bible you get it wrong when you when you read your bible the message will start coming out [Laughter] because the prophet took the message right from the bible praise the lord oh my goodness me whoa this is a good bible study let's read our bible first then we will preach amen my my mind behold when we come into the land thou shalt bound this line of scholar trade in the window which thou did let us down bound and thou shall bring their father and our mother and our brethrens and all the the father's house father household home on today and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of that house into the street his blood shall be upon his own head and we shall be guiltless amen now so this also shows us that it was not only rahab that was safe praise the lord it was not only rahab it was as many that was in rahab house that was safe so there were many people that were saved in rehab house that new rehab about the life that she lived praise the lord so as rahab was going to to to to the camera of ezra they went with her oh there were many of them that went with rahab now that they're not a proof of the life that she's lit that she left which of course i don't think there is something that we should approve of but sometimes you have to understand you have to you have to think behind the action of the person and says what put them in that life no little girl grow up from being smart and thinking her mind i want to be a prostitute no young man growing up thinks that i want to i just want to live on drugs glory be to god amen so this morning we want to talk on rahab scholar trade rehab scholar trade that's what we want to talk about this morning now the thing that is bringing me to this subject is that uh i was you know reading and studying and something here that that uh i've i've looked over over the years i've not been able to put it together uh i mean put all the pieces together and one of them was uh i think one of the brothers if i can remember i don't know whether it was brother stephen wolf's or brother brother ariel one time we were talking and asked me about uh the the three days and three nights jesus said as as jonah spent three days and three nights in the ballet of the world the son of man was spent three days and three nights in the heart of the earth praise the lord amen now so look at this in the scripture jonah jesus said that david also said his holy one shall not see corruption praise the lord amen so we know that 72 hours was not going to break upon him are we together because after seven or two hours corruption set into the body and you see that is the reason why uh uh when we when we when we when we leave this body we step right into our tear funding body so that that that promise of not seeing corruption was not only to to our lord jesus he brought immortality in view but it's also to the believers amen because we all come under he's the first bond of many brethren we all come under that promise that the holy one will now see corruption so as soon as we step out of this body we step into a new body we don't see corruption amen are we together amen and uh so uh uh but if you if you look at the two prophecy there jonah is spending three days in a wheel belly and uh uh uh and david saying uh uh the holy one will now see corruption you realize that you know christ must come out before 72 hours praise the lord and the scripture prove it because jesus gave up the ghost in the evening time amen and then early the resurrection morning he came off the grave so 72 hours did not clock over his body are we settled with that but a cross over it had to be at three days just like how it was for juna are we together but you will realize that's one of the things that drew my mind to this scripture that you will realize that the principle of three days and three nights has been played out in the scripture even before jonah jonah and alone did not hold the mistreat of three days and three nights no the first person that held the mystery of three days and three nights was abraham praise the lord god spoke to abraham for him to go and and and prove his love to god by sacrificing isaac amen is that what the scripture says are we together are you sitting out there and saying what is brother one cooking whatever i'm cooking you're going to eat it a guy can promise you it's good [Laughter] by the help of the lord i know you sit in there and say what is he cooking this morning praise the lord we don't cook anything we just want what has already been cooked [Music] amen god spoke to abraham and the scripture says they had to go at three days journey is that what the bible said they had to go at three days journey and when he got to the mountain abraham told his seven you wait for us here the lady myself will go up and make a sacrifice praise the lord now when god spoke to abraham god told abraham to kill his son to sacrifice his son kill sounds a little bit violent but to sacrifice his son but the truth of the matter yet is dead in as much as god told abraham in ibrahim isaac was already dead because he obeyed the lord so isaac was already dead he never told sarah nothing about it and he went three days and on the tv that was when they got up on top of the mountain praise the lord amen if abraham sacrificing isaac on top of the mountain was a type of crimes then you can see this now only because if when jesus went on on on top of the mountain he had to die but up on top of the mountain there isaac never die why because he has already completed his three days and abraham told isaac i have received you as one from the dead is that why he said to isaac i have received you as one from the dead so you can see it in time abraham and isaac had a three days journey and it was all pointing to calvary and isaac got his resurrection when angel held the hands of abraham he lied down on the altar and he woke up on the altar oh glory be to god praise the lord oh my god now so you will see that there has been this thing and uh uh let let me take few things here brother branham share quickly created of sin the prophet of god said today i was thinking of the cathedral a ringing out and a bell stored in and sofa like that and people going to to the church and making ready and the women buying their easter huts and so forth what has this come to mine how i can understand where a rabbit hat where a rabbit has anything to do with the resurrection praise the lord in another message brother bam says even the rabbit was not an accepted animal under the old testament how has it become part of the church easter eggs and all of these things easter hearts and easter flowers and all of these things he said how has it become how how how did we get down here because the very beginning of these things were pagan washing that were introduced to the church from the roman church that's the reason why every year easter has to fall on the roman catalyte length season whatever room decide is the allen season that's when it become our easter praise the lord so you see how how a idolatry is always trying to move parallel with the scripture it comes so close that if possible the ilit will be deceived and how we have been deceived to believe that jesus died on friday good friday it is not proven right but the roman catholic church gave it to us we swallow it we believe it and it's good fridays it's good friday glory be to god hallelujah amen now you have to realize that the easter it is something that was that is captain uh uh uh that is uh copy after the jewish passover when god told ezra that this will begin the beginning of months praise the lord amen bringing his people out of the land of egypt now you see let me let me correct this before you think that i'm trying to establish something in your mind just as how christmas is wrong that's how easter is wrong it's all being given to the christian church by the roman catholic church and it's all the other worship the reason why we participate is not for the evening it's for the person we try to bring the true meaning of the person christ jesus and now the tradition and not the dates right because some people become so uh uh uh uh you know they they become oh yeah is wrong i mean it's completely wrong christmas is wrong nothing you know that that is not truth but if that is not true it's chris christmas is wrong that is not true it's either there was no christ that was born all you have to find the truth date that he was born praise the lord now so i would rather stand for the fact that christ was born he was a gift that god gave to the world praise the lord whatever day you want to take you want to carry it to january 1st i will be right there with you to tell you i believe that christ is the gift of god to the word praise the lord that's what matters the person but the world is so caught up in the evenings and the commercial world has taken over it they make dresses for christmas and flower for christmas and trees for christmas and everything for christmas and that is the thing that people buy to believe that they are saving christmas or celebrating christmas but brother branham said christmas to the believer it's a time of worship he's for the matter of fact he said why should it be only one day when god gave us such a great gift we must be able to have christmas every day of our life when you think about the gift of god christmas must be every day of your life amen praise the lord but we get caught up in all the actions and uh the things in what of you glory be to god now see where i'm going now the reason why i'm driving into this thing so this the same thing with easter he says i can't understand where a rabbit has anything to do with the resurrection see how a christmas tree has anything to do with the birth of christ is pagan friends we have got off the path somewhere that's right but now a real born-again man or woman realized because there's life within you tells you that's wrong christ's life within you tells you that when christmas come in all the christmas party how can we celebrate the party of the holy one being drunk his life within you tells you there is something wrong with that glory be to god so we go here and uh uh i mean we can we can travel on with this you know and just and just go on run down the race track here he says uh sad we will see jesus so this great feast that we are approaching here now you know in this season this this lengthening as they caught it and approaching good friday a week is the easter i believe and then i just i just dropped this in just because brother branham identified that with the length seizing so that's that's how our christmas is determined when rome has determined when should be length praise the lord now so so we see here but it's beautiful when you look in the scripture it's beautiful when you look in the scripture and you take a very close walk on this subject you take a very close walk and you ask yourself how is this praise the lord the scripture identified it was the first date of the week early that morning mary magdalene praise the lord went over now you have to you have to also recognize here that uh uh they will stay in one form stay honor judaism the birth of the church has not come until pentecost so they were still meeting and respecting their sabbath praise the lord i mean so if it was sabbah mayor magdalene wouldn't have gone off of her house that's right praise the lord so we we see that i'm just trying to pull some things here into into uh so you can be able to understand that so let's look at having a few scriptures that i wrote down here studying on this let's look at uh saint john chapter 12. let's look as in john chapter 12. sorry i'm not i'm not making you excited this morning praise the lord amen sin john chapter 12 you just look at the first verse the bible says then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which has been dead whom he has raised from the dead and it was there a better name where merit anointed him for his death and burial so six days before the passover praise the lord now so if it was on a friday and you want to count six days back you will have to fall on the sabbath amen am i right glory be to god amen now so if you watch that in the scripture you will also see when you get over to verse 12 of the same chapter the bible says on the next day most people would come to the feast when they heard jesus was coming to to jerusalem took branches that was when he drove into jerusalem singing hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord amen now one of the things that is attached to that prophecy is there as jesus was going through jerusalem he was being examined by the people because the lamb had to be examined for four days so he was examined by the people he was examined by the church he was examined by the government amen and they found no fault [Laughter] oh glory be to god oh man it looks like i'm just in myself this morning i'm in my elements somebody got to get me out praise the lord amen glory be to god now so when you when you put this together and uh and and and and uh and the sacrifice how to be killed on the 14th day of nissan praise the lord it had to be killed on the 14th day the sacrifice had to be presented on the 10th day amen praise the lord and then it must be a zombie because 10 is the number of of election am i right oh yes in the scripture praise the lord amen so that the sacrifice how to be a zombie for four veins the priests had to look at the sacrifice up and down you you read that in in leviticus you see that and so so you see here it kind of it it throw this off and throw this off and and there and there are there there are a few other things that that we can look at there but i'm just i'm just putting it there so you can look at the scriptures and there are different other scriptures also you can look at in in the in the bible and uh i have them all written down you but i mean it's going to take me into a real bible study this morning to be able to cover that place but we already know you know by history and in the prophet of god letting us know that's a pagan feast so we have to bring the truth meaning out of christmas we have to bring the truth meaning out of easter amen because if you don't if you don't have the true meaning you are just you are just into a pig and wash it amen praise the lord see what the church nominee will do jesus coming going through jerusalem it's called palm sunday praise the lord they will give you know palm branches to everybody and then we stick prime venture we hold palm branches we go to church amen oh i knew i knew when i used to do that we hold palm branches we go to church but the prophecy was blessed is he that coming in the name of the lord amen before our king cometh that was the prophecy but you see the church just gets stuck to the tradition by holding prime branches and they don't even have the king in their life they don't even reference him and respect him as king. but they just go around the town and cut all the pre the palm trees disturbing the plant tree for nothing when this time jesus does not need a palm tree he need us to open our heart and say blessed is that that the king that cometh in my heart he want to ride on us like the donkey are we together so you see there there are a lot of things that play their right in prophecy you will see why the the the the high praises told the people quiet keep quiet and jesus said if you tell them to keep quiet the sun will raise up all of those things were taken right they were taking place right in that time so you bible students you can go home and read your bible again i i sure have given you some work amen and then we can come back and talk about it so that's that's one other thing the principle of the three days that's what caught me into the subject i want to talk about today the rehab scholar trade think about it what inspired her that she could not take a blue thread she couldn't take a white or a black trait she took a scarlet thread to let down those those pies young people the things about the things of god is not a guest game you have to love the lord god with all your heart it's not a guest game it's not you being smart praise the lord we have never went to church before but god was dealing with her heart every time she listened to the news and she heard about ezra coming closer there was something that was in her heart something that fear that she was feeling in her heart and that's what brother branham says a lot of the time when you feel nervous he said when you are feeling nervous it does not mean that altogether you are wrong he says it's it's a holy spirit that is hovering over you you just feel nervous you feel uncomfortable lord i don't know what i wonder what what's happening to me praise the lord is god trying to get your attention but she never been to church you don't know anything about that she had to choose that path of life for her to be able to take care of herself and take care of her family you see this girl even though she was living a horrible what we were called a horrible unaccepted lifestyle but you see the love that she had for her father's house the love that she had for her king dreams and which of course i believe it was not everybody that supported her in her life's time glory be to god amen why why she didn't take you know uh a different color she had to take a skullet a red rope and she let them down and they told her this very same rope when you put it up just leave a little one hanging the same line that you let us down by praise the lord glory be to god amen oh thank you jesus thank you lord you love the lord [Music] oh what a wonderful jesus brother adam said yeah in the message christ i had my nose all scattered so i didn't bring my quotes through but we can deal with the few that i have here now all the way from genesis to revelation is a rare strike of redemption all through the bible that's how howard rehab house stood on the wall of jericho when all the rest failed because there was a scholar thread down the outside and god honored the scholars tribes that's what caused the children of israel not to be slain in egypt the other son because there was a blood on the door when the deaf angel passed by that's what caused the church today in the last plague death the church is the only one that we live today and i go out oh my goodness me praise the lord when i see the blood i will pass over you that's right now but you can you can understand that god was not just looking for the for a literal blood god was looking for something that he can look through not something that he can look at he was looking for something that he can log through red true red so you see there for for uh uh the the the the people of israel in goshen it was a blood on the door but for rahab it was not a blood it was a rare treat i mean leviticus it was a red huffer it was not what he want to look at is what he want to look at you through oh glory be to god that's what caused the church today oh i love the lord jesus amen see the church will be the only thing that will live through this uh modern stake a church what gospel is those who got the blood on the dopples here amen of the blood of the lord jesus christ now so you see the thing that is there uh uh uh uh like the scripture said the letter killer the spirit gave your life people get stuck in today so you say god says when i apply the blood i will pass over you he says uh you know the blood of jesus so the nominal church the guests talk in that and they think that god has to see the literal blood so that talks about all the blood oh uh yeah the blood of jesus the blood cover me it's not what god wants to look at it's what he want to look through praise the lord so when god looked at his church today he's not looking at us through electoral blood he's looking at us through a bleeding promises that's the reason why the word of god is the blood to the church he's looking through the promises that he have probably he have prophesied and promised for this day that's the reason why john says if we walk in the light as he is in the light and what is the light the word is the light when we walk in the light then we have access to the blood so our connection to the blood is the light is the word of god when we walk in the light of god for our day and connect us to the blood you can stream the blood all you want and don't push the devil's back [Music] but when you take the promise and say satan god said in his word [Music] you say you devil god said in his word by his scribe i'm here that's the thing that pushed the devil's back you can cry the blood the blood cover me in the blood bathe me you can do all of that they don't fear the devil because he knows where the blood is he knows where the blood is praise the lord it's not what he wants to look at is what he's looking through god is looking through his promises at his bride glory to god praise the lord you can take a red the most pretty red cloth and hang it through your window be like rahab you can go and take a red cloth and hang it through your window it's not what you want to look at it's what he's looking through oh glory be to god man jesus amen praise the lord can i pour some of this water over my head am i allowed no i would not uh i would not think brother jordan would be happy with me praise the lord amen he don't want me to spoil his uh pretty mac having my ear but it's beautiful for falling in love with jesus it's the best thing that i've ever done amen the best thing that have ever happened to me i was just playing the song the other day the best thing that have ever happened to me falling in love with jesus brother branham says just love him amen hey just love him oh my goodness me the church will be the only thing that we get across all these shush with gospel amen and just romping people off and making people radical praise the lord some people think being radical is faith no the more faith you have the more humble the more simple you will be amen why should you be radical when you trust in the law to be your defense just surrounded let him fight your battle he says they know where they are standing if they are really born again they were not entangled with every yoke and every doctrine and every and and talks about year and dead with every cut they know where they are standing in christ through the blood standing in christ true it's what he's looking through it's not what he's looking at lord many times we think he's looking at me he's not looking at you he's looking through the blood that's why he the father don't see all the weaknesses in me because he's looking through the blood he's not looking at me praise the lord oh jesus thank you hallelujah you love him this morning what a wonderful savior he is yes you see that's why god sent a prophet because the church all through the ages like brother baron said in the church age book the church idolatry has run in parallel with christianity right from the garden of eden it has run in parallel and has run so close and they have some places where it has even intertwined christianity versus idolatry better better than talk on those things and that's the reason why we have to be we we we we have to trust the lord we have to be careful because it's so easy to go into idolatry it's so easy to think that you are worshiping god when you have stopped shot of worshipping god and you're just worshiping at church worshiping a movement called the message worshipping a prophet and you're not worshiping god brother branham says uh uh god reaching mercy he says every time that god gave the people anatomy something that's supposed to bring them closer to god they end up making an idol out of that fight when god gave them the brazen serpent when you look at the brazing serpent you will be healed they make an adult out of it it took hezekiah to destroy the brazen serpent they make an idol the tabernacle in the wilderness they make an idol out of it the prophet moses to make an idol out of him idolatry is means striving to reach to god man trying to trying to make it with god without using god's provision it runs so close people so close he says there will be the one the one the ones that have the door the the blood on their doorposts the word apply the bleeding word the lord the the blood of jesus christ the new birth he says they know where they are standing if they are really born again they will not entangle with every yoke and every doctrine talks about you know in every cut they know where they are standing in christ through the blood notice the red the the half of must be red amen that's another sign so here we're talking about uh uh a rahab scholar me let me close here because rahab also she held the mystery of redemption she held the the the the mystery of the three days you remember what she told told the the the the spies i let you down they are going to look for you so high yourself three days she buried them and then after three days they resurrected if they did not listen to her they were going to kill them so she held the sign of the resurrection oh my goodness me no wonder she's in the lineage of jesus christ no wonder the holy spirit put her name there [Music] oh my praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we serve my goodness brother branham said here he says he said fellowship with god true reconciliation he said read all sort is a sign of danger he said red it's a sign of redemption god god brings redemption through the red blood rehab the heart was redeemed by the scholar threat that left down from her house amen now that there was there was there there was some word also where he tied rehab into redemption and uh okay i think it's left him the other portion of my note okay i'm almost out of time here so uh let me now kind of for close this up for you but let's look at this let's go back to the scripture there in the in in uh in the book of joshua not rehab this time amen let's go in the book of joshua praise the lord amen now the scripture says here in verse 15 then she let them down by a call through the window praise the lord in verse 18 the bible says behold when we come into the land thou shalt bound this line of scholar threat in uh the window which thou has let us down back so that's that but just that one word ba make us to prove that it was the same chord so here the spines as are using a word a line there rahab is using talking about the same thing but using two different words are we together praise the lord glory to god oh thank you jesus amen praise the lord hallelujah amen glory be to god uh you know my my my own pentecost has not reached to dancing yet amen praise the lord it's uh brother andrews and uh you know donald reagan those guys that can be dancing all over the place praise the lord is wonderful when i see the holy ghost using the man that way verse 15 then she let them down by a card through the window amen and in verse 18 they are telling her this same car that you let us down by you should hang it in your window but they are using a different word a line what does that mean if it is the same thing praise the lord it's the same thing let's not make any big thing out of it here but let's just look at a little bit because it holds a mystery you know i was telling uh uh uh i i i spoke here on death does not change your nature one wednesday night and talking a little bit about the millennium and i i was looking into something and brother branham shows there in revelation how the the the the ten kings you know he show in the scripture that how by one word he says by one word it shows that they were not kings they were detectors so just by one word it can change the story sit on our one word and eating was not the same again and that's the same way god can put one word it was just only one word by that was a word that we find that shows that it was the same thread but let's look at something here before we close when you look at the word card that was used there uh in in in verse 15 by rahab that word called is it means rope it means a measuring chord it means a line so you see it's the same word just like in verse 18 because it also means a line but the word also has a meaning that means pain sorrow and travail praise the lord pain sorrow and travel they were getting down that wall in pain and sorrow because their life were hunted for they were going to go three days in travel there is no place to cook because they are hiding from the army of jericho three days in pains and travel glory to god and then in verse 18 the spies use the same word but this time they didn't say a call they said a line and that word line means in hebrew is tick hack a word that is spelled t i g u uh g u av and you will see that the the the israeli national item is called they'll teach the the tick ticker i got to get this tongue surgery done praise the lord and it means that the very same word that means pain and travel in the way that she use it when the spies use the very same word it means hope praise the lord it means hope it means things to hope for it means an outcome praise the lord amen after three days of pain and travel the hope of the word came out of the grave oh praise the lord oh my goodness my goodness so you see between the rope that was hanged down for them to come down praise the lord and three days so what happened there is that the jericho soldiers were all outside searching all in the wood all around the walls of the city so i bet you rehab had to bring the call in so for three days pains worry the sexual house and everything after three days of fear she knew she said for three days high yourself and job said he will hide me in the grave until my change comes hire yourself for three days man my head is spinning [Laughter] because i just i just love it when god use his word and bring out three days of pain and travel after three days hope is on his way after three days so in in rehab she held that's the reason why like i read that scripture to you and then and the bible says paul says by the scripture this is what i've received of the lord that i give to you that by the scripture jesus died by the scripture he was buried by the scripture he rose again so it's in the scripture it's all over the death burial and resurrection of jesus is all over the scripture [Laughter] oh my goodness praise the lord and here is a heading right in the life of rahab how in the world when she went and bought that rare card from the market she was not even thinking that spires are coming to my house so let me get red card she just went on shopping one day and says this looks long maybe i can reach from my window down and she bought it god just dropped that in her heart it is not it is not her physical need but that predestinated sea needed a red card so she shopping down there and bought it let me just yeah just take it to the house praise the lord and she went and just threw it on her bed it's been there six months two years three years glory be to god amen how in the world just like brother branham says heather you said the right thing and god felt so pleased when got on her knees and went under her bed and brought that red car up glory be to god even the spies they could not put any interpretation to white but almighty god that watches over his own amen praise the lord almighty god now watch over his word the god whose world will never be defeated every word that has gone out of his mouth don't return back to him if we have to be fulfilled god blesses so much wow my goodness me these fires are hidden in your house security alarm all over the country you got to get those men when she looked down her window oh my goodness this place is too high if you drop down you're going to die oh my god what can i do she's checking all over the house took a curtain down two three they can't even reach then the holy ghost brought to her mind you remember three years ago you bought a red card and you threw it under the bed exact measurement exact measurement exact measurement let me read something to you then i close because you you have this place so sweet i can just talk and talk and just pray i mean the atmosphere is just so good that i'm not frustrated of what i'm saying you know you know where sometimes the preacher gets frustrated it's no matter hearing me hey are you yelling mean to amen how's amy i don't feed that oh praise the lord let me read something to you then we close here woof i love the lord jesus and what a wonderful yes wonderful wonderful jesus he is um hallelujah oh man well if the lord don't want me to read it then i won't find it brown was talking about the precision of the holy spirit and it came out so well i might have copied a code to something now it came out so well brother brown was talking about how the holy ghost can be so precise and i took that cut down because i thought we could learn from that amen we could learn from that and uh okay i thought we could learn from that and i believe that we can learn from it just give me one minute you i'll let you go [Music] so he's talking here about uh yeah i can find a quote for you but i know what the story is he's talking about a prayer line and this lady came in the prayer line and brother brandon prayed for her and she took a prayer card and she was number three and she came back for another need and she prayed she said lord you've been so good to me the last time father i asked you for number three you gave me number three she said lord can you please give me number three we're talking about three days so it's just felting she prayed and said lord can you please give me number three she got to the meeting and billy paul was giving up uh a prayer card and when she looked at her number it was number 97 her spirit dropped in her heart and brother banham came to the pulpit and after he got through praying preaching and he was going into the prayer line and he prayed and he said lord he says he said this morning he said for this prayer line we're going to start from 100. and go backwards [Applause] he says he says that shows how the holy spirit is so precise [Music] that show how the holy spirit is so precise and god is precise on your needs he's precise but he don't work the way your mind thinks and sometimes we pray for things and pretty soon we throw our bible down and say how can i pray for this and and then the precision of god does not work according to the way your mind thinks he said this shows how the holy ghost is precise musicians you can come let's make love to jesus a little bit oh my my goodness me praise the lord hallelujah oh my mom am i oh my my my my my i was listening to the prophet he said that i copied i said well this this should be a good one i have to i have to keep this one and i know i throw trust somewhat i can pick it up you know i can pick it up somewhere here praise the lord now so you know church church young people [Music] we say young people not because we think that [Music] you know you don't know anything or we think that uh i mean you stay innocent some of you are more smaller than me but you see we say this just to encourage you i'm looking for something i drop in my notes here one of these days brother branham talking about crisis identified the same he says many times we get nervous and we begin to think well they ought to be this way in the auto we have got to make it this way and make it their way we don't have nothing to do into a just play our part that he lead us to play remember there is nothing out of calcutta praise the lord [Music] young people brothers and sisters but we can just encourage you [Music] get in the word get in the word i mean it's so easy for you to come and play the religion just step in church and you are not really connected to what god is doing in this building you are not connected you're living your own individual life on your own island you make your own decision you run your own government you do everything you just own your own island you just step out you come and visit with us we love to have you visit and you are not connected there is not a body connection [Music] if you can be able to put the thoughts of one service to another and said the lord spoke this time and he's speaking this time and this is what he said and and and last service okay i see why the lord used that brother to say this and and just bring the picture together and that's the thing
