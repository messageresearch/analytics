Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh but it didn't work out and and so we wanted it to be in church. So I I decided that well I would respect her or desire. So uh and we just we just thank the Lord. We thank the Lord for his uh for his goodness, you know, uh his his love and mercy. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So well uh thank you musicians. That will be all for the music. That will be all for the music. I wanted to to really sing some songs this morning, but uh uh I I didn't know where I left my dancing shoes, so I I just took another one. Praise the Lord. Amen. Well, we we just uh thank the Lord and and uh this morning we we want to do something. I want to recap on some things. I really been trying to find my way back to what we've been speaking on before we travel. So, uh uh I would try to do some recap this morning. But then, uh in the midst of the recap, I also uh been thinking about a subject. Many years ago, I was preaching for brother Elijah Jebu that do uh uh come come and speak for us here over in Liberia. I can't remember when that was, but I I was I was speaking for him and then uh I went there talking about something and and I started talking about uh uh how uh sometimes we play God. How we play God. You know, as children sometimes we we play uh children we play father and mother. You are the mother. you are the father, you are the your teacher, you know, I'm the student. You know, children play those things. And we we are very fond of uh talking about uh uh uh encouraging oursel not to play church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and we see people playing church and people play religion. But uh uh I I thought about how also people play God and the thought of playing God is uh sometimes you find that uh in in in many forms of relationship. Uh sometimes we play God in the in the life of our children you know uh uh I mean we should be parents we should be guidance but their destiny is in God's hand. Sometimes in the in the life of our our spouses, we play God. You know, you think that maybe without you, the person cannot exist. I mean, that's that just uh you didn't give birth to them. You didn't give life to them. And uh uh all of our destiny is in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; So, uh I was just talking in their direction. But after the service, the thought left on me and I went home and and then I started started studying. uh I look at the subject, I make some notes on it, I just left it down. And uh this morning I was going to speak on something completely different. But uh while I was I was uh here yesterday evening studying and praying and uh and in the thought of what I wanted to talk about, this whole thought came back to me about playing God and it just couldn't leave me. So I said, "Well, okay, I'll go back. I couldn't I I really didn't have time to look for my notes because I was looking at something different. So I said, well, okay, I would just I would just uh uh involve it in what I want to talk about this morning. So uh uh what we want to talk about this morning uh Paul uh in the book of 2 Corinthians speak about that when he talk about the mystery of iniquity. So we want to talk about the mystery of iniquity but uh with with the inspiration of playing God or with a sub subject of playing God. And uh and I think if there is ever a time ever a time where men try to play God, you know, sometimes the government try to play God and uh you know our leaders try to play God, sometimes uh pastors try to play God in the lives of the people. So we want to look at that this morning. Amen. and just pray that the Holy Spirit will be able to bless uh uh the inspiration and then uh uh make it meaningful to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Like I always say, I'm not a teacher, but I will try this morning uh because uh uh I I put some images together. I went back and took the image that brother Feed the other night when he spoke to us. I will I will visit the preacher from overseas. uh uh went back and took that image because uh it was part of uh uh of my subject. Like I said, he went he you know, he actually throw me into the water. He pushed me. So I have to swim. Amen. &gt;&gt; He pushed me. So I have to swim. If I don't swim, I will drown. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. So I have to swim. He actually pushed me. I was trying to take my time to come to that and he really really pushed me. So I have to swim. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So, uh uh the Lord bless you this morning. I hope uh we have a good time in uh around the word of the Lord. That's the reason why we are here this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's just stand on our feet and uh let's stand on our feet. We will take our Bibles. Uh if the the if uh the technicians are ready back there, they will bring me pointer and then we will we will start off but we go over to the book of second Thessalonian. We go over to the book of second test and that I mean as we as we stroll into the book if you are familiar with what Paul said to the Thessalonians you will know exactly why we titled this plain God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that's exactly what the man of sin will be doing. He will be playing God. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh, 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. Let's read from verse one this morning. Praise the Lord. I hope you have I hope you had a breakfast or you have a cup of tea this morning. If you didn't, I never also. Amen. So, I will know just exactly how you feel. I don't want to I don't want to hold you on the grounding of my stomach because my stomach ground all the time. Sometimes the children ask me, "Daddy, what is talking there?" I said, "Well, you know, that's my owner children talking in my stomach." Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh, you ready for the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope, uh, I hope we all we have a good time. I hope that the spirit of lord will just uh come in our midst and just give us a wonderful time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Visitors just there with us. That's the way we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I hope uh we will not offend you. But sometimes, you know, we have something to offend everybody. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometimes it's uh it's not intentional, but uh uh because it's the word of the Lord. Second Thessalonians chapter 2. Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be now shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, none by word, none by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. There's a big history behind this. I will read and then I will allow you to to sit and then I will go a little bit into that. Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed the son of pedition. Praise the Lord. The man of sin be revealed, the son of pition who opposes and exalt exalted himself above all that is called God, all that is worship so that he as God sitted in the temple of God showing himself as he is God. So this guy is playing God. &gt;&gt; Okay. So we have a prophecy here that uh yeah that is the antichrist. We have a prophecy in the in the Bible where there will be a man that will try to play God. Amen. A man that that says he can forgive your sin. A man you know and all of that. But uh uh uh uh we know that that is a prophecy and that prophecy will crown uh an individual that the Bible called the man of sin, the son of pedition. There will be a man word that prophecy will crown. That word will embody in that man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But until then, it's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit right from Genesis. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there has been making people to play God. Be making us to play God. &gt;&gt; Let me say, let me make it general this way because you see uh uh uh that's that's what Satan did. Let me not go ahead of myself, but Genesis chapter three, we will get there. He told he told Eve that you will be as God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and she was already gone because she was a daughter of God. She came out of God. You see, when you are asked, you are played. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I I that's where we go in this point. So let's just read. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember ye net that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withhold it that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity and that's what I call the mystery of iniquity the mystery of iniquity is uh is is plain gone I will explain why I say that I explain to you the mystery of iniquity does already work. So you see Paul saying it's already working among us. &gt;&gt; That mystery of iniquity is robbing us of our potential of being sons and daughters of God. We are not coming to that full potential of what God want us to be. But we are playing it &gt;&gt; instead of living it. &gt;&gt; Instead of being what we supposed to be, &gt;&gt; we are playing it. It's two different things. &gt;&gt; You can play a manager. &gt;&gt; You can be a manager. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can play a husband. &gt;&gt; You can be a husband. &gt;&gt; It's different from playing a wife &gt;&gt; than being a wife. &gt;&gt; Are we together? For the mission of iniquity does already work. &gt;&gt; Only he who now leth will let until he be taken out of the way. And then shall the wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. Even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all powers and and and signs and lying wonders. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And with all deceit of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved. The Lord bless you. You may have the comfort of your seat. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if the seat is not comfortable, let us know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because we want you to be comfortable. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; He is good. He's a good God. The Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What what an awesome God we serve. And uh uh brother young Emmanuel, are we ready? Are we ready back there? Okay. Praise the Lord. Amen. So if you if you have me put up my first uh slide, okay, that's uh that's my uh uh the title of my message. Uh the the mystery of iniquity, playing God, oppose and exaltth himself above all that is called God, worship, and he seeded in the temple of God. He sure himself as God. We will come to that. We'll come to that. Let's let's just get a little background of uh uh a little get a little background of uh what uh the subject is. Go to the next slide. Some this thing is not moving now. So uh in in the next slide here uh uh there are some uh this thing is too small but I'll read it for you so you can you won't be able to strain your eyes. Now the background behind second testimony is that uh good to see you sister masa. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just sink in. Amen. Uh uh uh the background behind second Thessalonian is that the you read a book of of Thessalonian, you realize that Paul had to write second Thessalonian as as uh reburdened. He was he was he was replying something that came up in the church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was replying something that came up in the church. If you look at verse two again, he says that ye be not Don't Don't change it. Just leave the slide up. that ye be not soon shaken in in in your mind or be troubled, neither by spirit, not by words or a letter from us as that the day of Christ be at hand. You see, because what was happening here is that uh you read the book of Acts, you hear word uh in in in the first three, four chapter, Peter and James were wicked. But when the Roman government actually started putting pressure on the church, when the persecution started on the church, it started in Thessalonica. Praise the Lord. So when this persecution started and uh uh uh uh when when when you read down here, you will see where the it says that uh uh uh that's that's where the persecution began. It was in Thessalonica that the first gentile were killed by the Roman Empire. The local Roman government in that part of the country said that every Christian had to bow before the statue of Augustus Caesars. He had to uh uh he had been dearified and and and and the statue of Caesar was erected. Every Christian who don't obey &gt;&gt; that it was persecuted. So this is what happened. This is why Paul wrote them because when this persecution started, it shocked the believers because I call into what were being preached. The church must not go through the persecution. &gt;&gt; So when the persecution started, they started asking, "Well, I thought we should be raptured. Why is this happening? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then then a sense of confusion, you know. Then they started writing back to Paul. &gt;&gt; So do you see the background? That's why Paul now have to tell them these things have to take place. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Don't be troubled in your faith. So you will see that's the reason why in second Thessalonian he even talk about the rapture that all of these things the man of sin has to be revealed. The the the the mystery of iniquity has to be revealed and all of these things have to happen before the rapture. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul was trying to make them to see that this is a persecution. This is not a tribulation. &gt;&gt; The church will not go through the tribulation but we go through persecution. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see the way the people receive the word and many times like I said Wednesday night we go through the same thing when when we when we going through one trial or another then we start asking why am I going through you're supposed to know why you're going through it because you are a son of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You are the only one that God can give test to. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is the thing with us. As soon as we get through a little thing, uh maybe it an illness or maybe we go broke or maybe something happened, you know, that we we we quick start to look into our dark past. &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that was that was kind of a troubling the church here a little bit. Are we together? It was in Thessalonica that uh that the dream of uh the procedure of offering a cast of wine. That's that's what I have right here. It's too little. I didn't realize that I got it too small like that. uh uh uh to to to cast off wine on the altar of Venus or or or Caesar and then publicly take it out to the marketplace, you know, because uh they knew that these Christians did not eat things that were offered onto idols. So what they did, they would do these things, make their their idol, you know, sacrifice uh and then they come go in the marketplace and sprinkle it on the vegetable and the leaves. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and they were doing it purposely to to target the Christians. Praise the Lord. So the first major persecution in Bible history of the Christian church started with the church in Thessalonica. So Paul now had to write them back quickly and tell them don't be troubled. Don't be troubled. It's going to be okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be okay. Don't be troubled. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except this and this and this and this happen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Do you get the background? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you get the background? So that's the reason why he had to quickly write uh uh uh so if you if you just read through second Thessalonian you get the picture quickly because he's addressing all of those things. He putting end time he putting end time events into sequence. &gt;&gt; This is going to happen and that is going to happen and this is going to happen. Let nobody deceive you that the rapture has taken place. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that we we went through a little bit of that corona virus. It was oh yeah there you know uh uh uh we are in the tribulation. Amen. Quickly then Christians oh the mark of the beast that the vaccine is the mark of the beast and the people start carrying all sorts of theory around. We we have to we have to grow up. Like I said Wednesday night we have to grow up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We has to grow up by knowing the word of God that we would not be moved when things happen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so that is our background. That is our background of what we want to get into this morning. If we if only we can be able to. But now you just pause that in your mind. I'm going to come back to that. Just hold that in your mind. Don't go anywhere. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't sleep on me either. &gt;&gt; Cuz I will wake you up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can't call your name, I will knock this thing so hard. Even though my hands will have to pay for it, but I will do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, you just stay right there. Let's go to our next uh uh slide. &gt;&gt; Okay, this is where brother Fammy left us the other night. He was here. It was a Wednesday night and I mean it was it was beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the the presence of the Lord was was was reaching the building. The word of God was rich. The atmosphere was rich. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I realized that the the brother was getting he was getting into so much word. Amen. And there are things that he wanted to say until he started abbreviating certain things. I laugh after I laugh at him a little bit. You know when he says your service online I said preach. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now so that's just where he left us. Now this is the gentile kingdom. uh uh a dream uh that was given to Nebuchinnezzar. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A dream that was given to Nebuchadnezzar. Oh, it's working. Oh my god. Praise the Lord. This is where I wanted to get. I come back to that. Now, you will realize that uh uh uh uh in the history of the Bible, I want to grab your mind here. Israel had a giant that challenged him. &gt;&gt; And that giant was uh uh uh &gt;&gt; Goliath. Amen. That giant was Goliath. Where is little Samuel? He's the one that's supposed to ask that Samuel desto Goliath. Praise the Lord. And uh and and the Israel giant was hit in his head. Praise the Lord. David released the stone and it hit the giant in his head. The Gentiles also had a giant, but our giant was more a spiritual giant. Their giant was a physical giant. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And our giant was hit in the feet. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The stone that was cut out of the mountain. So you will realize here that in in in the in the history of the Bible there are things that are playing out. &gt;&gt; We see that uh Pharaoh had a dream that Joseph had to interpret and Pharaoh dream was concerning the redemption of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the redemption of the Jews, God will give the dream to h a pharaoh. God will give the dream to a world leader at the time. God will give the dream to an unbelieving political world leader. Something that concern the redemption of his children. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Why? Because it's Pharaoh dream that will bring Joseph in the picture. And when Joseph give the interpretation, Jacob and the rest will come back into Egypt or they would come into Egypt. &gt;&gt; Then the beginning of the exodor will start. &gt;&gt; So the dream that he had it was concerning the Jews redemption. God in in the in the book of Isaiah or the Jeremiah called Nebuchadnezzar my seven. &gt;&gt; So here say God now is giving another Gentile, another unbelieving political king. &gt;&gt; He's not a church member. &gt;&gt; But God is giving him a dream. And both of them had their dream. They woke up from sleep. They can't remember it. &gt;&gt; The dream was so troubling. &gt;&gt; The dream has so much impression on them, but they couldn't remember it. And they really knew that, whoa, I need an interpretation to this dream. Pharaoh had the same experience. Nebuchadnezzar had the same experience. But Nebuchadnezzar's dream was concerning the gentile redemption. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to pass out uh uh a little bit of test after after the lecture. So pay attention. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't know the answer, just write whatever wherever you remember. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Write it on the tables of your heart. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh uh uh so we see here Israel had a giant. He was hit in the head. The gentile giant was hit in the feet. Alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh had a dream concerning the Jews redemption. Nebuchadnezzar had a dream concerning the Gentile redemption. You see this Bible is the book of life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This Bible is not a historical book. &gt;&gt; Even right now what we are going on with the word economy is right here in this Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see when God was doing this uh uh uh he was doing this giving these men these dreams it was to cover &gt;&gt; the history of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm &gt;&gt; going too fast. I want to go back. Okay. This is where I was. And that's uh uh Daniel chapter uh 2:27 to 35. Praise the Lord. You read Daniel chapter 2 uh uh uh uh 7-35. Uh there there is something there. I I'll read that later. But let me read this to you. This is from uh uh the gentile dispensation. Beginning any of the gentile dispensation. The way the gentile kingdom issue in it will go out the same way. That's right. By supernatural works, supernatural interpretation. You know what I'm talking about? The working of the supernatural. Oh, how marvelous. Amen. &gt;&gt; Supernatural dreams, supernatural work, supernatural interpretation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Many times we read this, we we just make emphasis with a beginning with a man, worship of a man out with a the worship of a man. But that was not the only thing that was there. The most important thing there is that there was a supernatural gift that was introduced and and and the same thing with the g with the Jewish the Jewish age. We could read this if we were back in the time of of of Joseph. It started with a supernatural gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was this supernatural gift that that put Joseph into trouble. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Think about it. You go back there. You talk you you you you you read about that in Genesis Jacob had a dream. Go back and read Jacob's dream. He had two dreams. The first dream he had was uh uh uh uh uh the 12 stars. &gt;&gt; Joseph dreams. What? What did I say? &gt;&gt; I said Jacob. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; I need to drink water. Let Let me drink it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so Joseph had this dream. He he he had a it was it was all about the 12 stars. The second dream, the moon and the sun was in his dream. Now watch this now because you know a people that first about a prophet word not coming to pass. &gt;&gt; Jacob Joseph first dream came to pass. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When his brothers came and met him in Egypt &gt;&gt; was about the second dream. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Now he will be a false prophet because her mother Rachel died. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. before he before they came to Egypt. &gt;&gt; So we were saying his prophecy never came to pass but his prophecy was spiritual because Jacob Joseph's second dream is fulfilled in Revelation 12. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The woman the woman having the the sun on her feet. That's the fulfillment of Joseph's second dream. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see the when people get fussy and and we try to use this our our small brain and we think that uh we had read enough of of of of the Bible of history and you know we get proof. Oh yeah, this prophet said it never came to pass. It never go back now. Can we should we tear that place out of the Bible? &gt;&gt; You will only tear it because you are foolish because you don't know that these are the words of God. Those men were just medium. &gt;&gt; It was not their thinking. They are not responsible to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; If God gave a man a prophecy, he's not responsible to fulfill it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might never happen in your lifetime. &gt;&gt; It never happened in their lifetime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Joseph said this thing, his mother Rachel was there. &gt;&gt; But the fulfillment of the prophecy, she was there. She died in Bethlehem, giving birth to Benjamin. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, will y'all just leave us for now? You know, we will hold to we will hold to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you uh uh we'll hold to what the word of God says. We'll hold to what prophet has said. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we see here the gentile kingdom started in with a supernatural work, supernatural interpretation. Amen. This was supernatural. Nebuchadnezzar had no idea of what this was &gt;&gt; in so much that he was ready. He was ready and determined to kill all his magicians, all his astronomers. &gt;&gt; If y'all don't give me an interpretation of this, I'm going to whip all these people out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was ready. He was ready to just to to to to just wipe them all out because uh uh uh uh it trouble him. He have never had a dream that will bother him so much. And and and uh uh Pharaoh was willing to do the same. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we we will not go through all of this today. We just we're just using this to get ourself to where where we want to be. So we we realize that uh uh uh uh Pharaoh had Pharaoh dream concern the redemption of the Jews. Nebuchadnezzar dream concerned the redemption of the Gentiles. And these two were unbelieving idol worshiing leaders. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Mhm. &gt;&gt; They were unbelieving idol worshiing. The thing that is wrong with our society, with our Christianity is that sometimes we want to make great we we we try to interpret great people life just so we can agree with them. We we want to make them somewhere they are a believer. The person don't have to be a believer before God. God made every one of us and he can use he made us. &gt;&gt; He can use us for whatever reason. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said leaders are raised up and set down. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they are ordained of God whether you like it or not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't want to get into to you know to politics or whatever that I don't like bringing it over the poop. So let me just stay with what I'm preaching. Don't go there at all. Let me tell myself, don't go there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But these were all un unbelieving, unrighteous uh uh men worshiping idols. But God gave them supernatural dreams concerning his people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so we we we will see here that uh uh uh there in in in in Daniel chapter 2. Let's let's go there in Daniel chapter 2 quickly. Let's go there in Daniel chapter 2 quickly. Like I said, I'm I'm just I'm using this uh uh don't don't take the image down. Just leave it there. Uh you people back there, I don't want to uh give you people a lot of lot of trouble. I know you got to pull things up and bring things down and so just leave it there. You already did a a lot of work to get it up there. So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we we sit in the seat here and when and when things don't come up on the board easily, it's so easy for us to feel funny. What are they doing back there? Those young people are doing a lot of work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes uh uh if you like, you can go visit with them. They will show you what they doing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so if you look over here in uh uh you look over here, I'm trying to get Okay, you look over here in Daniel chapter 2 verse uh 34. That's that's what I want to I want to go quickly. Like I said, I'm going to come back to this as we as we go back as we go through the sub. I keep referring back to this. So, uh uh it might be for the rest of the month or the rest of the year. I don't know. But uh so we see here that the Bible says in Daniel chapter 2 verse uh 34, the Bible says, "Thou saw it." Daniel is telling Nebuchadnezzar, "Thou saw till a stone was cut out out with our hands, which which stone the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and break them into pieces." Praise the Lord. So, right here, we see we we we got an image here uh uh that I that I copied from Google. We got an image here and and a stone here uh uh hitting the image on his feet. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We talk about uh uh the the the the the giant that challenged the the the Israelite, the Jews, Goliath. When David got down there, he picked up five stones. Amen. And that five stones uh is is is being spelled out as Jesus s you know is being spelled out as f a t faith and all of that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And now year also so a stone hit the the the challenging giant to the Jewish in in his face. Now a stone is hitting the challenging giants to the gentile in his feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the the the the challenging Jewish giant was a physical one. Our giant is a spiritual one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the whole book of Daniel is all about spiritual warfare. &gt;&gt; It's about spiritual warfare. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If you I mean if you just think that uh uh uh you know uh uh uh uh being a Christian is just to go to church and become you know uh belong to a church, put your name on the book and all of that. You you just don't know what you are talking about. &gt;&gt; You don't know what you are talking about because this is a this is a kingdom principle. &gt;&gt; Okay, these are kingdoms that are at war. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of dark forces. is the kingdom of evil power is at war with the kingdom of light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there is no way you you can you you want to be identified with the kingdom of light &gt;&gt; that you will not come under one one attack or another. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's all about spiritual warfare. We will get into there. It's just an introduction here. But so we see here, let me read this now. thing of uh what thing of Christ and uh and then I beheld. Praise the Lord. And then I beheld till there was a stone caught out of the mountain with our hand and rolled into Babylon pour pulled down and it and it became a great mountain that fell all the earth. He said that was Jesus Christ the son of the living God. Hallelujah Daniel. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was the stone like like David said h you you you you come against us as a mighty giant but Goliath I come against you in the name of the almighty God. Amen. Of the God of Israel. And that name was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the same thing that is playing out here. So we see here uh uh let let me take another one here from from the seven church ages. And the God of heaven cut a stone out of the mountain with our hand that stone this image uh uh uh in the feet and broke all the gentile kingdoms down. And the kingdom of Christ ruled and reigned and growled and covered the earth from sea to sea. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the stone year hit the image, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The image fell and there was the as the image is falling, there's a dust that rose up in the air as the image went down to the ground. But as the dust was uh was was fading away, there was a mountain. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it in here. Let's read it. I saw thou saw till the stone was cut out of the hand cut out without hand. Which stone the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them into pieces? Then was the iron and clay and brides and silver. All of those uh uh component that made the image of the the the the gold, the brides, the silver, the iron, the clay, brass and savor and gold broken into pieces and became like a chaff of of the summer churching floor. and the wind carried them away and no place was formed for them. Praise the Lord. What is happening yet is that the political power now is being swept away and is going to turn to a religious power but we will get into that. Amen. So there was no place found for them and the stone that smiled the image became a great mountain which fill the whole earth. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So this stone now became a great mountain. So it replaced the image. It cast down the image and it became a great mountain. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm I'm I'm fishing this morning, so all of this is just a bit on the hook. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next image. I think I froze this thing. It's okay. It works. Sometimes it don't work. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay, go to the next one. We covered this one already. So, this is the mountain that came. This is the mountain that was made off of the stone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the stone hits the image in his feet, the Bible say out of the stone came a great mountain. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you have to realize now that all of these things ha interpreting uh Nebuchin as a dream, all of these things are spiritual. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are giving you we are we are putting image to it so so it can it can it can become vision to you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this is the mountain that came out of the image. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's something I saw in uh uh Isaiah Isaiah chapter 2. That's that's what is written right down here. Let's let's let's go there. That's Isaiah chapter 2. You don't have to go. That's that's is this these are just Bible verses right here. Isaiah chapter 2, I think, reading from verse two. If you read there, and it shall come to pass in the last day that the mountain of the Lord's house. &gt;&gt; So you see this mountain &gt;&gt; was also going to be a house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That is the reason why we use this because pretty soon in another image we're going to bring the church ages in. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So Isaiah is saying here, it will come to pass in the last day that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountain. I've never seen this before until recently that how the parame fit this interpretation of the scripture. Let me read that again to you and then uh and so you can look at it and see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mountain of the Lord's house, this is the mountain of the Lord's house, shall be &gt;&gt; established in the top of the mountain. So this is a mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is a mountain. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mountain of the Lord house shall be established in the top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And shall be exalted above the hills, and all nation shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, "Come here, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of God of Jacob." and uh he shall teach us of his ways and and and we will walk in his path out of Zion shall go for the Lord and the word of the Lord and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I said, I will come back to this. I I will I I will dwell on it and and there there are things that I want to bring to you from there because you you will see where you will see where all nation shall flow onto it. Amen. you see where all nations shall flow unto him because that is the work that is done in the gentile church when God says I will get a people out of the nations for my name's sake and it will have to do with a seven church ages praise the Lord &gt;&gt; amen so I'm I'm not worried about that now I'm going to come back to And uh uh well I let me leave this. Okay. So I I I kind of for just bring it down yet a little bit. So just to be able to give you more picture about it is is uh uh so the the the the mountains of the Lord. Amen. In the Lord's house. So we see that uh uh uh that's the reason why we using the paramil because because uh uh we know that uh uh there there are three uh uh uh historical Bible you know uh uh theologians will will will will tell us that you know that God first wrote his word in the heavens. Brother Brandham said that you know the heaven was God's first Bible. That's why Paul can say even nature itself should teach you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nature itself should teach you because the heavens is God first Bible. &gt;&gt; And the and the second one was the one that Enoch built. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now we don't we don't read the par. You don't need to read the heavens because you have the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to start learning to be a stargazer when you have God's word here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing. We we are not uh uh uh uh uh parame worshippers because uh over over the years the the the the signs of the zodiac has changed. The Babylonians change it and uh uh the Chinese get their zodiac. The Indians get their zodiac. So which zodiac will we believe? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come back to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's come back to the word of God. So So here we see here now the the mountains of the Lord. The reason why I'm saying that because every every stage in the growth of the church was a mountain. &gt;&gt; That's what I said. I will explain that to you better. Every time the church was growing, we realized here that uh the first messenger to the Ephesus church age was Paul. Amen. He met the pillar of fire on the road of Damascus. He was the first messenger to the church age. Paul was the one that wrote most of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Paul wrote most of the New Testament. One of one of the exciting things that you will see there is that Paul sent a letter to seven churches. Sorry. He sent a letter to seven churches. He wrote 13 letters. &gt;&gt; Does that Does that Can you put the mouth together? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wrote 13 letters. &gt;&gt; But he sent a message to seven churches. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What are you seeing? 13 is the number of a woman. &gt;&gt; So if you you count all of Paul letters, they are 13. But out of those letters, he wrote to seven churches because the letter of Filimon was not to a church. It was it was to Filimon. Amen. The the letter of the Hebrew, it was not it was to the Jewish believers. But these were the seven churches that Paul sent his letter to. Therefore, Paul wrote the biggest part of the New Testament. God had God had him to do that because uh it's is coming a gentile age. So we know that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, they just wrote a record of what they witness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They wrote they wrote an eyewitness report. But when it when it comes to to the the the the the what we call the New Testament, Paul wrote it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Praise the Lord. Paul wrote the New Testament. So, yeah, that's that's why we have him here uh h as as the as the as the foundation stone and and uh and Paul Paul was uh uh uh a prophet and and an apostle to the Gentiles. Praise the Lord. And then we come through the seven church ages, but we will get to that. Amen. So what's happening here now is that we see yes the church here the mountain that came up after the image went down is the church the mountain that came up because in in Nebuchadnezzar uh h dream God was speaking about gentile kingdom. Amen. the Babylonian, the Mes and Persian, the Greeks and the Romans, they are all gentile kingdom. But after the Gentile kingdom, he was going to get a people out of the Gentile for his name's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that people will be now the church. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now in this church because th this now is going to is going to set foot for what what I want to go in this morning. So we can go back to our subject. I was just I was just trying to to to get you wet in the water a little bit. So right here uh uh uh uh the mountain that has come out after the drop of the image now we see here now is the church. But what is happening here in this picture that you are looking at with many of you that that have an idea about it is this is uh Revelation chapter 6. this right here in Revelation chapter 6. Uh the first few verses in Revelation chapter 6 and and and and uh and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal and I heard it was were a noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying one of these four beasts. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is the lion, the ox, the man, and the eagle. one of these saying, "Praise the Lord, come and see." And I saw and beheld a white horse. This is the one now. So right here represent the demon power that is coming. You have to remember now Jesus says, "I will build my church, but the gates of hell will not prevail against it." He didn't say the gates of hell will not come against it, but he say it will not prevail against it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So right here we have a h a stream of demon power that is coming against the church in every ages. Right? Our Lord Jesus Christ was persecuted. He was crucified. John the Baptist hair was cut off for this very same gospel that we were that we are preaching. Peter and John was put into prison. So there is a power that is always fighting against the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But yet we want to be on flowering bags of &gt;&gt; eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just want it easy. We want an easy ride to heaven. The ride to heaven is easy when you are believing. When you are believing everything God is doing in your life, &gt;&gt; you are believing everything that God is doing, knowing that he's bringing you to a better person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's bringing you to a better person. Jeremiah, wake on your brother. I don't know if he's meditating or he's sleeping. Now, so we see here I saw in the white hearse and he that that went for to uh went for conquering and to conquer and when he had opened the second the the second seal, I heard the second beast. And the second beast was an ox. We will get all into death. Now uh uh the second beast uh said, "Come and see." And there went for a red there. This is this is the red hearse here. The first one was a white. The second one is a red. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A red heart. And power was given to him that sat upon to take peace from the earth. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. To take peace from the earth. the the the emerging of uh you remember the last time we talked on building in troublesome time I was bringing you the three wolves &gt;&gt; we will get into that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I like I said uh Fe just threw me in the water so I just have to swim. &gt;&gt; So he said come yet and power was given to take peace from the earth and uh and that they should kill one another. And there was given unto him a great swallow. And when he had opened the tears seal, I heard the tear beast, which is a man, the anointing of a man, saying, "Come and see. And I behold and look uh I saw a black horse." Amen. And uh uh and he that sat on it had a pair of balance in his hands. Amen. And I heard a voice in the midst of the full be saying a measure of wheat for a penny. Three measure of ballet for a penny. Right here that's when purgatory and uh uh uh even back those days uh uh uh uh in the early church you have to pay for your seat that you sit on. &gt;&gt; Wow. the the the the rich people they just they just say we want to sit in this row you know they pay for it whether they are in church or not you don't sit in their seat &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; you read church history you find it out &gt;&gt; amen there was a man uh uh that that that rebuked that out of the church raised up a man that rebuked that out of the church &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Amen. That's I mean that's the reason why I mean we should not have no special city in the house of God. &gt;&gt; And uh so yeah the Bible says and I heard a voice of a measure for the and see you heard not the oil and wine one. When he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth beast which is which is the eagle saying come and see. And I look and then I saw uh pill and his name that sle him was called death. And you read down and down and down. So what is happening here is that that the reason why I I I I brought us out of this way is to bring us to where we are because right here is a gathering of powers. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you have to realize that all of these came through the seven church ages from the time of the book of acts to our time that we are living in. All of this came through the seven church ages. At the time that God had the lion anointing, the first three church ages was under the lion anointing. We will get there. That that's that's when the gospel was going around the world. This man uh I mean they were risking their life. Just just remember the man like uh we call him doubting Thomas. But when Thomas got the revelation that Jesus Christ has resurrected, he was not afraid to take the gospel across the sea &gt;&gt; into India. So they were all on this. And while they were on this, there was an evil anointing that was also fighting against the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Are we together? &gt;&gt; There's an evil power here that was fighting against the church and then and then uh and then we so on and so forth. So we see here there's a gathering of powers. I'll come back to all of this. Like I said uh uh another time. So we see that the red, the white, the red, the black hers combined to a deadly pill house. All of these power come to our age. &gt;&gt; They have combound and it has become a pill. And what is happening is that uh what it will produce when those power comes together it produce Satan incarnate &gt;&gt; in a person &gt;&gt; or a people. &gt;&gt; That's where playing God comes on the scene. Because that's what we read in Thessalonians. He will sit he will exalt himself to be God to be as God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's where playing God, our subject of playing God comes on the scene. But why these powers the reason why they are coming together is also right here also God is pouring this power into this power and into this power and yet they are all coming together the lion the ox and the man's anointing all join under the eagle anointing and what is it producing is going to also produce Christ incarnate &gt;&gt; is going to produce a son of man ministry &gt;&gt; in a person &gt;&gt; a bride &gt;&gt; in a people. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's a gathering of powers. &gt;&gt; We are in a time where there are gathering of powers. Few few days ago some maybe early this week or last week we saw Russia, China, North Korea gathering their power, showing their military might. They are saying we don't we don't care for America and the West. They can't do nothing to us. All of those three leaders gathered there in China and they had a parade better than what we had in the US. The Chinese brought all of their war power and uh and and and Russian president is there, North Korea president is there and the Chinese president is parading. What are they doing? They are gathering their powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Y &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is the word council or churches doing? Gathering her powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to be doing? Gathering our powers. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gathering uniting time and shine. We're supposed to be uniting with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be getting close to God &gt;&gt; to get stronger in our faith. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that is the thing that is bringing us to where we are this morning. Gathering of powers. So with that with that being said, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Gathering of powers. And as so we we we we see here as as I as I get into my subject and and and try to uh let you get out of here quickly, friends. Settle down. Settle down yourself. Settle down yourself. That's why Paul was telling these people in the book of Thessalonian. We read, "Settle down yourself. The hour has come. There has been a lot of playing religion. There's been a lot of playing church. &gt;&gt; Are we guilty of it? Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; A lot of playing church. &gt;&gt; And when people play religion, you play church. The next thing you will play is God. &gt;&gt; That's the next thing you will play. &gt;&gt; You will become the God of your life. You don't believe nobody. You believe only yourself. &gt;&gt; Is that not the slogan of the time? believe yourself. &gt;&gt; You won't believe nobody. You don't have an absolute. You just believe yourself. Which mean you have you you are playing God. You have become God to yourself. &gt;&gt; You worship yourself. &gt;&gt; You don't care what the Bible says. You don't care what I mean whether there is a God. You know, everybody trying I don't care about a god. You know, the the atheists, they are nostics. That's what he say. They just believe in themselves. There's a lot of playing church. But the hour has come where God is calling a people out. &gt;&gt; Calling the people out of what? Playing church. Playing religion. &gt;&gt; Because the danger of that is that you will play God. Whether you like it or not, you will play God. &gt;&gt; And when you start playing God in your own life is an antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; You are possessed with a rebellious spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? We are we are not living in the days of playing church. We are living in the days when Jesus Christ is making himself manifest to his church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To prove through his word that he might be fulfilled. These things that I do, you shall do always. &gt;&gt; It is not just drama. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; but that's what the church wants now. We just want an entertainer, &gt;&gt; someone that just come and make us laugh and you know and just and just we just laugh laugh our heart out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and and is is this uh is this uh uh uh uh uh making himself manifest to the church, proving his word? That is the challenge for the age because the age don't want the word of God. No, they don't want the word of God. They don't want instruction from God's word. &gt;&gt; They want to follow their heart, &gt;&gt; follow their mind. When this very word of God tells you your heart is desperately wicked, &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; the Bible say desperately wicked. &gt;&gt; But the real word, the the true word for that is that your heart is incurable. &gt;&gt; It cannot be killed. That's the reason why God always says get a new heart. I gave you a new heart &gt;&gt; because it can be killed. You cannot you cannot uh you cannot kill the pro the corruption that is with that came with our first birth that is in this heart full of jealousy, full of anger, full of rage. &gt;&gt; And to our own destruction. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's to our own destruction. That is the time that we are living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the time that we are living. Thank you young people. You can take this. Let's let's keep this for another time when we get there. Just give me Genesis chapter 3:5. Let's let's go quickly here. So I just I'm doing all of this just to bring you to where what I want to share with you this morning. I know I took more more time in my in my introduction than what I want to say this morning. But if you read Genesis chapter 3 verse 5, you you you see their temptation of the devil there with Eve. See what he says. He says, "For God does know that the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as &gt;&gt; God. He robbed them &gt;&gt; of the divine image. &gt;&gt; He robbed them of the deity that they were. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead of you being God, you can be as God. &gt;&gt; You just playing God. &gt;&gt; Instead of you to to speak creation, &gt;&gt; you can wish that I can speak creation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You you you you enjoy living in the fantasy. &gt;&gt; I just hope I can speak myself out of here. &gt;&gt; You should not hope. You should be doing it. &gt;&gt; You should be doing it because Jesus said you said to this mountain be they removed and they were you should be doing it. &gt;&gt; Not that you should hope that you can do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? But what he did, he robbed them. He robbed them of that divine image. &gt;&gt; He robbed of them. That's the reason why Paul will says over in uh uh uh uh Philippian chapter 2. We we we we we went a little bit there on Wednesday night. Philippians chapter 2, let this mind be in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you. Philippians chapter 2 verse 5. Let's just read that a little bit. I know there's there's a place that I wanted to comment on a little bit here. Let this mind be in you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; 25. I'm right down here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ. Who being in the form of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being in the form of God. &gt;&gt; What was the form? The form was not his physical body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The form was not his physical body. The form was a theophonic body that was dwelling in his physical body. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was in the form of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Being in the form of God who being in the form of God, he taught it not robbery to be equal with God. That it was not robbery that he could says I am the father. I won. Jesus never second thought that &gt;&gt; that I came from God. I go back to God. It was not a second thought for him. &gt;&gt; He never taught a robbery to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he made himself of no repetition and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the image of a man. And being formed in faction of a man, he humbled himself and became obedience unto death, even the death of the cross. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we see uh that was the mystery of his being being God. But yet he could humble himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when men are playing God, what they do? They exalt themselves. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you are playing God, there is there is no divine power to control you. &gt;&gt; You can be nice for a woman and the next thing you tell the person, if it is not for me, you will not live. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You can just be nice for the woman. There is no divine power to be able to control you. &gt;&gt; You can just behave. But pretty soon you come on your throne and you exercise your power. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I make you who you are. &gt;&gt; Are are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh uh uh that's not just the mysteries there. is is being being able to balance the two where you have here the uh h a man in the form of God. &gt;&gt; He's he can say peace be still. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never went to a funeral &gt;&gt; because when he show up the dead body comes back to life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They call him to Jarus daughter house the people are crying. He get back there he say you get outside. Why you weep? Because she's sleeping. I go to wake her up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? He was in the form of God. But yet there was a divine power that could humble him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That even his creatures could mistreat him and he would not say a word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] the one that had the power &gt;&gt; over nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet there was there was there was such a divine power in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a guess work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a guesswork. &gt;&gt; Paul dealt with this. You see there over in Romans chapter one, what did he says? He says what? The the the law of the creature. Let's let's read there. Romans chapter 1 verse 25. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 24, he says uh uh uh &gt;&gt; 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the image made like unto corruptible men. They have changed the glory of God. &gt;&gt; We have make God our errant boy. &gt;&gt; The glory of God we have just reduced it to material things. perishable things. &gt;&gt; How can we bring the internal value of God to perishable things &gt;&gt; is when we have this then we say God blessing us. When we have this and and and that where the the really glory of where he want to change our lives, &gt;&gt; change our lives &gt;&gt; where he can make your life as a billboard for dying people on the street. where he can make you as a servant to be able to uh serve someone else. &gt;&gt; That that is his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have just reduced it into uh you know what we wear, what we eat and uh uh what we drive, where we live. That's where the age has reduced the glory of God to changing the incorruptible glory to an image of corruptible men, birds, and four feet of beast, creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to unclean cleanness through the loss of their their heart to dishonor their bodies between himself who changed the truth of God to a lie. They worship and serve the creature &gt;&gt; more than the creator. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will break God's word just to be able to keep a job. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The job has become a god to us. &gt;&gt; We can I I I I you know I I don't want to lose this job. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. or were you eating before they formed that company &gt;&gt; that we would tell lies and and then I mean uh we will cheat and lie just because we want to keep a certain image. &gt;&gt; We worship and serve the creature more than the creator &gt;&gt; who is blessed forever. God has has has become nothing to us in this generation because what we have become gods. We are playing God. We are playing God. We will go through uh h trouble go through trial. Let people give testimony. &gt;&gt; The only time God is mentioned is praise God. Praise God &gt;&gt; church. Praise the Lord. Oh, that only thank God. Now they about now to to talk about themsel. How I how I hustle. How you know I was there. How I was there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; On our billboards. God is in the corner. It's all about us &gt;&gt; and our achievement. We worship and serve the creatures. Are we together? We worship and serve the creatures. Paul in in in in 2 Corinthians chapter chapter 3 verse two he says they will be lover of themsel more than the lover of God. They will be lover of themsel. That's the age that we are living in. Perilous time. Men will be lover of themsel more than the lover of God. Praise the Lord. No wonder why the church in in in in in in holl they they they had to fight will worship. It's all about that self worshiping. All about that self worshiping. We must be praised. Our name must be mentioned. I did this and they didn't even call my name. When in the time of all people were doing h men and women of God were doing things in in silence because they knew Jesus said let now your left hand see why your right hand &gt;&gt; does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were doing things God laid it on my heart to do. Jesus said tell no man. He didn't say go and tell them I don't want open your eyes. He said tell no man. But when our name is not mentioned, we take offense. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says your body is the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Now what did the B what did what what what did this man of sin what did Paul told us here? He will sit in the temple as God. &gt;&gt; Your body is the temple of God. God must be sitting there. Not you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not you sitting there. &gt;&gt; God must be sitting there. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the Lord is in his holy temple. &gt;&gt; Let the earth keep silent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let all our fleshly desire keep silent. &gt;&gt; Let all our fleshly ambition keep silent. Let the temple magnify God. Let men see his good work. &gt;&gt; Let him see your good work and glorify God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we have our own personality sitting in this temple &gt;&gt; that is hard to see God. &gt;&gt; It's hard to see God. It's just all about you. It's hard to see God. Your veil have not been rented yet. &gt;&gt; And that's what the baptisming of the Holy Ghost will do. &gt;&gt; I tell you this morning, if you don't have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you will end up in self worship. You can't help it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't help it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will try your best. You will try the best and best and best that you can do. You will end up being frustrated because it's all about self-gratification. &gt;&gt; We don't love the worship because we did not enjoy it. &gt;&gt; Are you the one we worshiping? &gt;&gt; Are you the one we are worshiping? &gt;&gt; We are worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the age that we are living in. That is the thing that is killing our age. But as as as as Bible believers, we have to see it. The Bible speaks there a day where uh he that is filthy will remain filthy. &gt;&gt; It's an age where uh uh the the spirit of God is lifting up &gt;&gt; off the earth. Just like in the days of Noah when the Bible said God said my spirit will no longer strive with men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because his imagination has become evil. The people were just consumed about themsel and their desire. &gt;&gt; It's what they want to do. &gt;&gt; Whether it is against God or not, they just want to do it. &gt;&gt; Whether it's going to affect their health or not, they don't care. They just want just self gratification. They are sitting on the throne of their own heart. &gt;&gt; They worship themselves and they want other people to worship them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you see what we're talking about? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of iniquity. What is iniquity as we've been taught? Knowing what is &gt;&gt; right and failing to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing what is right and failing to do it. When you when you read there the Bible call that the the mystery of iniquity, it call it the mystery of lawlessness. What has brought men to this place? Every day there has to be some kind of a evil in the news. &gt;&gt; Men have just be they are they are just becoming so tested for their own blood. &gt;&gt; It has to be a bloodshed. It has to be death. It has to be h rape. Kidnap. Can't you see that Satan is the god of this evil age? &gt;&gt; And he's gathering his people. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he want to incarnate them. He want to sit on the throne of their heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; People just so caught up in their own mind and they bring bunch of Bible verse around it. When you know that the thing you're doing is not ain't making you happy. Then yeah, you look for Bible verse to to to to satisfy yourself &gt;&gt; to find a reason why you must stay that way. &gt;&gt; Jesus took up his his robe and and and and and and and towered himself and washed the disciples feet. He said, "I'm your Lord and Master. I did this unto do a one." He never said, "Wash your own feet. He said wash one another feet. Who feet are you watching? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the most lowest part of the body. Whose feet are you watching? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Playing God. We play God even in our own lives. Praise the Lord. It has to be our way of or or the highway. &gt;&gt; When you don't even have control over your own birth &gt;&gt; to even wake yourself up in the morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The God that we are playing is the God of death. It's not the God of life. You are playing the god of death because you are only killing yourself. &gt;&gt; You are adding more sorrow to your sorrow. &gt;&gt; I will I will serve God the way I want to. Who told you say the way you want to? That the way to serve God. You're serving yourself &gt;&gt; because that's the way you want to. &gt;&gt; That's the way you want to. That's the thing that makes you happy. That's the thing that pleases you. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is just the beginning. If God God give us grace, we will travel a little bit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a people that God will have the preeminence in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will have the preeminence in the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will have a pre image. That's that's Jesus word spoken through the Apostle Paul. I will have a church without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Jesus our Lord and Master, the God of heaven and earth in flesh can come to the place and say, "Lord, not my will." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not my will, but let your will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. We only remember that when we are having some we are in trouble. &gt;&gt; Now when we say God now my will when you feel causing the problem &gt;&gt; you feeling being disrespectful and disobedient to God's word and you say now my will let your will be done. When you really know that you want your will &gt;&gt; musicians you can come We continue on Wednesday night &gt;&gt; if the Lord want us to. &gt;&gt; If not, we continue next Sunday. The Lord bless you. [Music] [Music] Got a child of God. You go. Oh, God. Roll me. Steep and rough. when he needs me is enough. I want God's way to be my way every day.

[Music] The Bible say he exalted himself. He imposed himself and exalt himself. [Music] Father, how much are we humbling oursel? How much are we submitting ourself one onto another? When Moses said in the Bible, you will be the head and not the tail, he really never mean an opposing spirit. It's in leadership. The way we think about being the head is in leadership. And we you you you leave out an example. It's not you just sitting there and wanting people to do everything. That don't make you the head. You are the tail because they are doing everything for you. Be the head. The head leads the body. It's in our leadership. We want to be the head. We want to lead right. We want to lead our children right. We want to lead our home right. We want to lead our family right. That's what the prophet Moses was talking about. Father, you took on flesh upon us, Lord. You know what it You know what it is, Lord.

Father, Lord Jesus, and that is the time that we are living in. Oh God, we see it right. We see it in the political reign. Oh God, the political centers, Lord, Father, we see it, oh God, precious Lord God, in the corporate center, Lord, managers, they want you to worship them, oh Father, the spirit of of servitude is gone away from our society. The spirit of servitude where people will find an opportunity to self is gone away. We have just become our own God. We are sitting on our throne. We are sitting on our throne. We will not bend. We will not break to God's word. we is going to be the way we see it. Even if the Bible don't speak against it, even if the word of God don't support it, we have we have crowned ourself on our throne and yet we think we are worshiping God and yet we think we are worshiping God when we are not able to surrender and say, "Lord, I give it to you. I don't understand it, Lord. Father, if it left with me, I don't want to do it, Lord God. But this is what your word said. I surrender myself [Music] We have crowned ourself on our throne.
