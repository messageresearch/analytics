[46:48] a small group that gathered there
[46:50] in vera wilson home and we
[46:53] visited with them actually we had to go
[46:56] uh
[46:57] over to springfield my my niece and
[47:00] nephew
[47:01] were doing a memorial for their dad
[47:06] that passed last year uh
[47:10] and then uh because of all of the kovac
[47:13] restriction
[47:14] uh they were not able to give their
[47:18] daddy kind of
[47:19] homegoing they would have loved to give
[47:21] him so they thought that they would do
[47:24] uh a memorial uh
[47:27] this one weekend and they asked that i
[47:30] come in
[47:31] and spend some time with them so that
[47:33] was why we went there but we we have
[47:36] brother wilson in mind so we said well
[47:38] right after that we would go over and
[47:40] visit with brother wilson
[47:41] i've been talking with brother wilson
[47:43] for uh for some
[47:45] years now and but we never met
[47:49] you know uh is this kind of a friendship
[47:53] where you are just you know and and he's
[47:56] a missionary brother
[47:59] in most of the places he travel he gets
[48:03] to meet
[48:03] people that i know you know and uh
[48:07] and then he comes back from the trip he
[48:09] says um well man
[48:10] every it looks like everywhere i go
[48:12] somebody know you there
[48:14] but yeah we never got the opportunity to
[48:16] meet but uh
[48:18] it's very nice brother uh he's uh
[48:22] like i said a missionary brother and
[48:24] he's also a brother that is
[48:26] that is greatly greatly involved in
[48:29] different things
[48:30] and a few of them we share with you
[48:32] tonight
[48:33] uh he built on an app that i've been
[48:36] using for many years
[48:38] uh called the living word broadcast
[48:42] you know he has he has that website and
[48:45] he also
[48:46] has an app and
[48:51] and he was also involved in
[48:56] the
[48:59] the app uh that hosts
[49:03] the message hub okay there is there is
[49:06] another app or software
[49:09] that holds hold the message so he's he's
[49:11] a software builder i mean he's into all
[49:13] sorts of things i don't know what to say
[49:15] about him
[49:16] but uh that the thing did is that he
[49:18] built this act
[49:19] and like he told us uh brother ariel
[49:24] went with me and he's still working on
[49:27] it
[49:27] what he tried to do is that he tries to
[49:30] sync uh
[49:32] uh all link the bible with the message
[49:36] in the sense that you can go right on
[49:38] his app
[49:39] and and if if there is something that
[49:42] brother branham is talking about and
[49:44] there is a scripture to it
[49:46] you can be able to find a direct link to
[49:48] the scripture
[49:49] you know so uh this is a very very
[49:53] wonderful study studying tools i've been
[49:57] using it like i said for for many years
[50:00] and then he's also
[50:04] running a shortwave radio station from
[50:07] his home
[50:09] you know that goes out and he also run
[50:13] that
[50:13] on the on the living world broadcast
[50:16] and then in the same home
[50:20] he's have a
[50:23] monthly newsletter that he sent out
[50:26] you know and of course events
[50:30] and uh mission reports
[50:34] and structured and different things and
[50:36] in the same home
[50:38] he also uh is involved into
[50:41] uh uh uh
[50:45] uh pastoring
[50:48] uh books and and tapes that he takes
[50:51] overseas
[50:52] yeah you know he said his his children
[50:55] and why they were all involved into
[50:57] helping him
[50:58] uh most of the children are all married
[51:00] and and settling down in their own home
[51:03] and then and then in the same home
[51:06] they run they have a little group that
[51:09] gathered there
[51:10] every sunday and to fellowship around
[51:14] the world
[51:15] so he asked that we pray for him you
[51:17] know
[51:18] i mean words cannot be able to
[51:22] fully i'm not doing justice you know by
[51:25] just telling you like this
[51:26] i'm not doing justice as you as you know
[51:29] me i'm
[51:29] i'm i'm a kind of a very
[51:33] i have a casual way of saying things you
[51:35] know
[51:36] some people know how to put emphasis on
[51:39] things but
[51:39] i have a very casual way of saying
[51:41] things but i'm not doing justice
[51:43] by telling you uh you know some of the
[51:46] things that he does but i was greatly
[51:48] impressed
[51:49] you know i was greatly impressed and one
[51:51] of the things that that caught my mind
[51:54] was uh you know the code word uh
[51:57] bert branham said that uh you know
[52:03] one man in the hands of god is god's
[52:06] majority
[52:08] you know yeah one man in the hands of
[52:11] god
[52:12] is god's majority so uh that uh
[52:16] that actually was uh was very very
[52:19] impressive
[52:20] very very impressive and he just
[52:23] came back from from morocco
[52:27] yes the northern part of africa
[52:30] during the covey he got stuck in algeria
[52:34] with another missionary brother and uh
[52:37] he was able to come back because he's
[52:39] he's an american citizen
[52:40] so through the embassy he was here to
[52:42] come back but the other brother got
[52:44] stuck there for
[52:44] for for pretty much uh over four or five
[52:48] months
[52:49] you know yeah and uh
[52:54] yeah and and many other things that he's
[52:56] involving if the law's turret
[52:59] we're having one of these days to come
[53:00] and share some of the things
[53:02] that uh that he does for the lord it is
[53:05] very
[53:06] very very impressive you know very
[53:09] impressive you see
[53:11] the life of a man he's he's he's getting
[53:14] up there in age
[53:16] a man that have sold his entire life
[53:19] to save the lord you know
[53:23] all the forms he use with the little
[53:26] that comes in from mission
[53:29] he pulls his entire life pension
[53:32] into serving the kingdom of god
[53:35] it was it was uh it was uh
[53:38] encouraging you know it was encouraging
[53:41] to to
[53:42] to me and uh
[53:45] yeah so we visited with them and and we
[53:47] had the opportunity to speak
[53:49] uh uh
[53:52] and what i thought i would i would do
[53:56] was to kind of continue with mine taught
[54:01] wednesday night last wednesday we spoke
[54:05] a little bit from revelation chapter one
[54:08] and so while i was there
[54:11] i thought that i would i would speak
[54:14] on what i had on my heart that i would
[54:17] have spoken home
[54:18] yeah and a little bit
[54:22] with what we were talking on the weekend
[54:24] so
[54:25] uh but you know being being a visitor uh
[54:28] sometimes you take things in a very
[54:30] very different way than when you are
[54:32] home so
[54:34] uh we we had a good time there we had a
[54:37] good time i told them i was not
[54:38] preaching i just want to testify
[54:41] you know about the the coming of the
[54:43] lord you know and
[54:45] and all of that but tonight we will turn
[54:47] to sin luke chapter 24.
[54:50] we will keep in that scene in that scene
[54:52] light
[54:53] i was looking at some few things uh
[54:56] but then i had to quickly come when when
[54:59] i
[55:00] when i when i was told that we we just
[55:02] changed the service tonight
[55:04] because of uh some of the technical
[55:07] problems that we had
[55:09] so let's go to sin luke chapter 24 and
[55:11] let's turn to our feet
[55:13] and we will read a portion of the word
[55:18] praise the lord amen
[55:32] and what i did was i started reading
[55:35] dead
[55:36] in luke chapter 24 from verse 13
[55:40] where it pick up the two men on the road
[55:45] of emmaus
[55:54] from verse 13 and behold two of them
[55:58] went that same day to a village called
[56:02] emails which was from jerusalem about
[56:06] three schools for long and they talked
[56:08] together
[56:10] of all these things which have happened
[56:14] and it came to pass there why they
[56:17] commute together
[56:19] and reason jesus himself
[56:23] drew night and went with them
[56:27] but the eyes were holding
[56:32] that they should not know him
[56:36] and he said unto them what manner of
[56:39] communication
[56:40] are these that ye have one to another
[56:43] last year walk and outside
[56:48] and the one of them whose name was
[56:51] cleopath
[56:51] answered and said unto him i doubt only
[56:54] a stranger in jerusalem
[56:56] and have not known the things
[57:00] which i come to pass there
[57:03] in these days and he said unto them
[57:07] what things
[57:11] praise the lord and he said unto them
[57:15] what things if i should take a little
[57:19] talk tonight i will
[57:20] i will tie to it what things but let's
[57:23] read on
[57:24] he said unto them what things and they
[57:28] said unto him
[57:29] concerning jesus of nazareth
[57:32] now everything that they were talking
[57:35] was what has just happened and they were
[57:38] talking about him
[57:41] and he's asking them what things
[57:47] was he just trying to play
[57:50] a trick was he playing games or was he
[57:55] trying to prank them a little bit
[57:58] or what was jesus doing
[58:02] and he said unto him concerning jesus of
[58:04] nazareth
[58:05] which was a prophet mighty in these
[58:09] and words before god and all the people
[58:12] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[58:15] deliver him
[58:16] to be condemned to death and
[58:19] have crucified him we trusted
[58:24] that it had been he we
[58:28] should have redeemed israel and beside
[58:31] all this today is the 10 day
[58:34] since these things were done the lord
[58:37] bless you may have your seat as we
[58:39] continue to read
[58:40] here the certain women also of our
[58:44] company
[58:45] made us astonish which were
[58:49] early at the supper car and when the
[58:52] phone
[58:53] net his body they came saying that
[58:56] they have they have also seen a vision
[58:58] of angels
[59:00] which said that he was alive
[59:04] and certain of them which were
[59:07] with us went to the supreme court and
[59:10] found
[59:11] it even so as the women
[59:14] have said but him
[59:18] they saw now then
[59:21] he said unto them all fools
[59:25] and slow of heart to believe
[59:28] all the prophets have spoken
[59:32] ought not christ to have suffered these
[59:35] things
[59:36] and to enter into his glory
[59:40] and beginning of moses and all the
[59:43] prophets
[59:44] he responded unto them in all the
[59:47] scriptures
[59:48] the things concerning
[59:52] himself all of this why
[59:55] he's talking about himself
[59:58] but talking about himself in the third
[1:00:01] person
[1:00:06] let us pray heavenly father lord i would
[1:00:09] just
[1:00:10] need your help tonight lord god to be
[1:00:13] able to
[1:00:14] say something to glorify
[1:00:17] you and something that will be
[1:00:20] edifiering
[1:00:21] to your children tonight dear lord
[1:00:25] we want to thank you father for watching
[1:00:27] over us
[1:00:28] and keeping us since the last time we
[1:00:30] were in this building

[1:00:35] us yes

[1:00:38] all of your blessings
[1:00:40] we love you and we and we just thank you
[1:00:43] bless your word now
[1:00:45] and bless the little time before us in
[1:00:48] jesus name we pray
[1:00:50] amen amen
[1:00:53] praise the lord well the uh
[1:00:57] there over in nepersville there the
[1:01:01] illinois we spoke on what manner of
[1:01:03] communication
[1:01:05] that you have in one with another but i
[1:01:07] will not take that as a subject tonight
[1:01:09] like i said i will take
[1:01:11] what things i want to look at some of
[1:01:13] the things
[1:01:14] that they were talking about praise the
[1:01:17] lord
[1:01:18] amen and
[1:01:23] as we begin to begin to read the
[1:01:25] scripture and behold
[1:01:27] two of them went the same day to a
[1:01:30] village called
[1:01:31] myers i i think about uh i brought one
[1:01:34] in his friend i don't
[1:01:39] oh bless the lord amen amen he was
[1:01:42] traveling
[1:01:43] from jordan and he came to
[1:01:46] new york and went across over me to los
[1:01:49] angeles okay when he got to los angeles
[1:01:53] he didn't have a proper visa for some
[1:01:55] reason and
[1:01:57] then his boss told him to go back to
[1:02:00] north carolina and he said no give me a
[1:02:02] ticket to my brother's house
[1:02:18] be with me for a few days praise the
[1:02:20] lord praise the lord
[1:02:22] amen amen you are welcome
[1:02:26] god bless you brother good to see you
[1:02:29] jesus
[1:02:30] amen amen so uh
[1:02:35] uh well you've been walking with your
[1:02:37] brother i don't know what amount of
[1:02:39] communication you've been having but i
[1:02:41] think you had a lot to talk about
[1:02:47] praise the lord amen well so we we would
[1:02:50] just take a little talk here tonight and
[1:02:52] and uh if you remember uh last week when
[1:02:56] we talked about
[1:02:58] john experience did in in revelation
[1:03:01] chapter one
[1:03:03] the position of john uh uh
[1:03:06] as he as he represents the bride
[1:03:10] through the ages but what makes the
[1:03:13] subject
[1:03:14] important is that the position where he
[1:03:17] was
[1:03:19] for christ to call his attention back
[1:03:24] to the seven church ages that position
[1:03:28] is the junction we can call it the
[1:03:30] junction
[1:03:31] we can call it the bridge or we can call
[1:03:34] it
[1:03:34] the blending of time and eternity
[1:03:38] because john will add a position between
[1:03:41] revelation chapter 3 in revelation
[1:03:43] chapter
[1:03:44] 4.
[1:03:47] the voice that called john to turn
[1:03:50] around
[1:03:51] and look at the the the seven golden
[1:03:53] candlestick
[1:03:54] with the one that was in the midst of
[1:03:56] the seven goal in candlestick
[1:03:58] now he was in that position and
[1:04:01] jesus told him all the things that you
[1:04:04] see
[1:04:05] right you see that is the reason why
[1:04:08] the revelation of the seven church ages
[1:04:12] could not has come in the ephesus church
[1:04:14] age
[1:04:17] because john's position was not at the
[1:04:20] beginning john position was
[1:04:21] at the end that's the reason why the
[1:04:27] revelation
[1:04:28] of of the book of revel of the book of
[1:04:31] revelation
[1:04:32] you know the the the mysteries of the
[1:04:33] book who only have been
[1:04:35] revealed at the position where
[1:04:38] john was
[1:04:43] the junction or the bridge between time
[1:04:46] and eternity
[1:04:50] praise the lord amen
[1:04:53] now uh uh uh one one of the simple
[1:04:57] principle
[1:04:58] there which is a scriptural principle we
[1:05:00] have talked about a year before
[1:05:02] it is the very first time
[1:05:06] that a man we asked to see god
[1:05:10] and that was moses he asked to see
[1:05:13] god he said i want to see you
[1:05:16] and then in the book of exodus god told
[1:05:19] him
[1:05:20] almighty god told him
[1:05:24] no man see me and leave
[1:05:29] praise the lord amen amen
[1:05:33] the truth there is that we see
[1:05:36] god all the time when you look at
[1:05:40] the works of his hands you look at the
[1:05:43] creation you look at the design in the
[1:05:45] sky
[1:05:46] and everything god distributed himself
[1:05:50] in his attributes yes praise the lord
[1:05:54] amen but what the the subject here was
[1:05:58] that god was trying to get moses
[1:06:02] attention to this place that
[1:06:05] when when god is in action when god is
[1:06:09] moving or he's doing something
[1:06:11] the principle here is that
[1:06:15] god does it before we see him
[1:06:18] before we realize it because we we
[1:06:21] must understand like i've said before
[1:06:24] god
[1:06:25] is not in our time space
[1:06:30] he's out of our time space
[1:06:33] he's in tanner
[1:06:37] he does not work by 24 hours
[1:06:40] he does not work by seven days
[1:06:44] he don't have a 30-day steady one-day
[1:06:46] calendar
[1:06:47] that he worked back he worked out
[1:06:50] that's the reason why he can tell
[1:06:53] the end from the beginning he can be
[1:06:57] able to determine what would come to
[1:06:59] pass
[1:07:00] he knew exactly how it will happen
[1:07:02] because he's out of time he's just
[1:07:04] looking at time
[1:07:09] so this great internal one is bringing
[1:07:13] us to the
[1:07:14] understanding that you know that's the
[1:07:17] reason why jesus rebuked this man
[1:07:19] and he said slaw of heart
[1:07:23] the way god moved is too fast for our
[1:07:26] human nature to catch
[1:07:28] amen i don't care how smart you are
[1:07:33] how bright your eyes is god can pass
[1:07:38] you will never see him
[1:07:41] praise the lord amen just like jesus
[1:07:44] said just like jesus said
[1:07:48] and uh uh
[1:07:52] saint john chapter three he said
[1:07:56] just like the wind it blurth
[1:07:59] we feed it amen
[1:08:03] that's right but it's it's hard to be
[1:08:06] able to
[1:08:07] to uh to tell where it's going it it
[1:08:10] blows you say so well this
[1:08:12] this is the way in the uh direction that
[1:08:14] the wind you see the leaves go this way
[1:08:15] and then they come this way
[1:08:17] they go this way then they come this way
[1:08:20] you know it's
[1:08:21] it's hard to be able to to determine
[1:08:24] right there but we we feed it
[1:08:29] and jesus liking the moving of the
[1:08:32] spirit of god to that experience
[1:08:37] praise the lord let me say it this way
[1:08:40] you think about it this way
[1:08:42] i wrote something down uh uh some time
[1:08:45] ago
[1:08:46] you know you you think about these
[1:08:48] things you write them down
[1:08:50] and then they come to your mind when you
[1:08:54] don't know where you put your note
[1:08:56] but that's okay think about it this way
[1:09:00] this very same wind that blows
[1:09:06] okay that we don't know where it comes
[1:09:09] from and where
[1:09:10] it goes where it goes we just feed it
[1:09:16] if you take that wing
[1:09:20] in the form of an air
[1:09:25] and you put it into a tire
[1:09:33] you are sitting in your vehicle on four
[1:09:36] tires that have air in it
[1:09:42] and you drive down major highway
[1:09:47] you go 40 miles an hour you go 60 miles
[1:09:50] an hour
[1:09:55] what is carrying that vehicle with all
[1:09:58] the mechanical parts
[1:09:59] that it has if he does not have air in
[1:10:02] his tire a brand new
[1:10:04] engine will go nowhere
[1:10:10] praise the lord or you might drag the
[1:10:12] car on the ring you're going to get a
[1:10:14] noisy
[1:10:14] road that maybe the police will stop you
[1:10:16] because you destroyed the street
[1:10:18] when you do that but think about it
[1:10:22] when you when you when you put the air
[1:10:27] into uh
[1:10:31] something that you can contain it
[1:10:40] are we together
[1:10:45] now so god told moses that that is the
[1:10:49] concept
[1:10:50] the concept there is that you know and
[1:10:53] the people say you know we we just say
[1:10:56] it carelessly
[1:10:57] no men see god you know no man can see
[1:10:59] god and leave
[1:11:00] that's not the concept
[1:11:05] the concept of what god told moses
[1:11:09] is that he's not a god
[1:11:14] of three dimensions
[1:11:18] god is beyond three dimensions he's
[1:11:21] beyond the fourth dimension he's beyond
[1:11:23] he's beyond all of our dimensions he's
[1:11:26] intender
[1:11:32] praise the lord
[1:11:35] and that's the reason why
[1:11:40] he deals with us the way he deals with
[1:11:43] us
[1:11:45] is dead after he have moved
[1:11:49] after he have done it
[1:11:53] his work is finished he's gone and you
[1:11:56] turn around and say oh
[1:11:57] wow
[1:12:00] oh wow oh i asked god for this
[1:12:05] oh the lord helped me
[1:12:09] he's been gone
[1:12:15] are we together so that
[1:12:18] is the concept that is the concept
[1:12:22] that he was he was that it's a pattern
[1:12:26] it's a concept that he was establishing
[1:12:28] with moses
[1:12:30] he took moses and put moses into the
[1:12:32] rock he said stay right
[1:12:33] i'm going to pass by
[1:12:36] amen and i and and and i believe that
[1:12:40] moses had his eyes shining
[1:12:43] you know he was he was very attentive
[1:12:45] you know
[1:12:46] looking all over but god came in past
[1:12:51] and he only saw the backpack it was
[1:12:54] after he have
[1:12:55] already gone that's when you see it
[1:12:59] it's after he have already done it
[1:13:09] so that is the very same principle here
[1:13:12] that jesus was trying to show to the
[1:13:16] disciples
[1:13:18] all year fools slow of heart
[1:13:24] to believe all the prophets have spoken
[1:13:29] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:13:32] things
[1:13:33] and to enter into his glory
[1:13:38] so in one sense jesus was trying to tell
[1:13:40] these disciples
[1:13:42] everything that i have told you
[1:13:45] everything that i've told you
[1:13:47] everything that is written in the
[1:13:49] scripture
[1:13:51] if they are happening right before your
[1:13:53] eyes
[1:13:55] and yet is so
[1:13:58] slow for you to grab it
[1:14:05] it's so slow for you to grab it
[1:14:10] young people that's the reason why when
[1:14:12] you think that you
[1:14:14] have understand life and you think
[1:14:16] you're so smart you get everything
[1:14:17] calculated down
[1:14:19] you don't know nothing that's why paul
[1:14:22] says
[1:14:23] he that thinketh that he knows
[1:14:29] knowing that as he ought to know
[1:14:36] because the things of god
[1:14:41] are too fast in a way that god does it
[1:14:46] but this this this sinful body that's
[1:14:49] been redeemed
[1:14:50] is so slow to catch up
[1:14:54] it's so slow to catch up
[1:15:03] praise the lord it's so slow
[1:15:11] all of the things that we think we have
[1:15:12] honest to in the scripture
[1:15:16] there are words there are dimensions
[1:15:19] rings of understanding beyond those
[1:15:22] things
[1:15:24] that's why the prophet of god will tell
[1:15:26] you never put a period
[1:15:30] always put a command put a big command
[1:15:33] to
[1:15:34] so you can tell yourself that there is
[1:15:36] more to come
[1:15:38] there is more i need to know
[1:15:42] there is more i need to understand
[1:15:46] there is more i need to learn
[1:15:56] praise the lord now so jesus
[1:15:59] asks cleopas and his friend
[1:16:03] what manner of communication
[1:16:07] after he have heard them reasoning
[1:16:10] he says what are you guys talking about
[1:16:13] what are you guys talking about now
[1:16:15] this is this is where this this
[1:16:17] particular
[1:16:18] chapter scripture caught my attention
[1:16:22] there is so much in this question that
[1:16:25] jesus asked
[1:16:26] so much what what what
[1:16:30] where is your emphasis
[1:16:36] now as i i spoke a little bit on the
[1:16:39] weekend
[1:16:40] trying to you know make a picture of
[1:16:43] this
[1:16:43] these disciples walk with jesus for
[1:16:47] three years this man they were convinced
[1:16:52] like they said they were convinced that
[1:16:55] this
[1:16:55] man is the messiah with all that they
[1:16:58] have seen
[1:17:02] they were convinced that this is the
[1:17:04] messiah
[1:17:07] this is the messenger of the age
[1:17:12] a man that will raise lazarus from the
[1:17:16] dead after being there for
[1:17:18] for four days corruption have already
[1:17:21] set
[1:17:21] in his body
[1:17:24] and he never did it in secret
[1:17:28] that's right he says show me the place
[1:17:30] where you laid him
[1:17:33] and he went there and and the scripture
[1:17:35] says
[1:17:37] and the community went with him
[1:17:42] they follow him and they
[1:17:45] all stood there they all stood there
[1:17:50] just travel in your mind
[1:17:53] bending that evening
[1:17:58] when jesus said lazarus
[1:18:01] come forth
[1:18:07] when jesus said lazarus come forth
[1:18:12] he was tied in his barrier cloth
[1:18:18] and he came walking to them it's not a
[1:18:22] dream it's not a movie
[1:18:25] walking to them and they all stood there
[1:18:28] seeing
[1:18:29] him being unwrapped
[1:18:32] from the clothes
[1:18:40] amen now with all of the things that
[1:18:43] they have
[1:18:44] saw with their eyes they think they have
[1:18:46] witnessed
[1:18:47] forget about the the the the preaching
[1:18:50] because most of the things that he
[1:18:52] preached to them really never sunk
[1:18:54] in amen
[1:18:59] but all of the things that the witness
[1:19:02] with the eyes
[1:19:10] those disciples never
[1:19:13] believe that jesus
[1:19:16] could die
[1:19:20] they never believe it this man i can
[1:19:23] raise
[1:19:24] somewhere off from the dead
[1:19:29] if you just think about it in your mind
[1:19:31] you will realize
[1:19:32] that was the reason why they follow him
[1:19:35] to the judgment hall
[1:19:38] they stood by because they were they had
[1:19:41] an
[1:19:41] expectation that something would happen
[1:19:46] that he would change the scene they were
[1:19:49] just believing that
[1:19:50] he would do something even at the arrest
[1:19:53] of jesus
[1:19:56] yes that's right one of the romans saw
[1:20:00] your ear was
[1:20:01] cut off and jesus took it
[1:20:05] no surgery he laid it right back
[1:20:11] the man got his ears back with is calm
[1:20:15] the blood stopped bleed he stopped
[1:20:17] bleeding
[1:20:18] so they were expecting that this man
[1:20:22] he can change the same they were just
[1:20:24] saying their heart
[1:20:25] these people don't know our lord
[1:20:32] they don't know our lord
[1:20:37] now you think about it with all the
[1:20:40] expectation they had
[1:20:44] to see him his body coming from the
[1:20:46] cross
[1:20:47] lifeless they were disappointed
[1:20:53] they were disappointed
[1:20:59] that's what happens when you when you
[1:21:02] believe
[1:21:04] in something
[1:21:07] whatever it is in this life
[1:21:11] you believe in your parents day you see
[1:21:13] something
[1:21:15] that you don't expect you get
[1:21:18] disappointed
[1:21:19] in your wife in your church in your
[1:21:21] pastor whatever it is
[1:21:27] so they were disappointed now so
[1:21:31] jesus questioned what think
[1:21:35] what think
[1:21:41] shows us if you read a passage there you
[1:21:44] will see
[1:21:45] they said that are you are you a
[1:21:47] stranger
[1:21:50] that's right concerning
[1:21:53] jesus of nazareth are you a stranger
[1:22:00] concerning jesus so you see
[1:22:03] the answer jesus question
[1:22:06] by telling him that the thing
[1:22:10] that they were talking about the thing
[1:22:12] that was concerning them
[1:22:13] was the man jesus
[1:22:18] was the man jesus
[1:22:23] which is the flesh the body
[1:22:26] the things that they have seen
[1:22:30] but if you look in verse 26 jesus said
[1:22:34] ought not christ
[1:22:38] to have suffered he did not say oh
[1:22:41] not jesus to have suffer
[1:22:45] of not christ
[1:22:49] because that body was enveloping christ
[1:22:53] elohim was in that body the great
[1:22:56] anointed one was in that body
[1:22:58] and everything that was fulfilled by the
[1:23:00] scripture
[1:23:02] was concerning christ it was not
[1:23:04] concerning jesus
[1:23:07] but they were stuck with jesus
[1:23:10] they were disappointed in jesus
[1:23:18] but he was trying to take them a little
[1:23:20] bit further
[1:23:28] out not christ that's the reason why the
[1:23:30] bible says beginning from moses and all
[1:23:33] the prophets
[1:23:34] what was he showing them that christ
[1:23:38] he was saying it was christ the seed of
[1:23:40] the woman
[1:23:42] that bruised the head of the serpent it
[1:23:44] was christ that was lifted up
[1:23:46] just like moses lifted up the brazen
[1:23:49] stepping
[1:23:50] right from moses right from genesis
[1:23:53] all the way down he was showing that it
[1:23:56] was christ it was christ
[1:23:57] it was christ it was christ it was
[1:24:00] christ he was not showing them jesus
[1:24:05] he was showing them christ
[1:24:10] it was christ
[1:24:14] in joseph that his own brothers
[1:24:18] have to sell him
[1:24:23] almost for 30 pieces of savor
[1:24:27] it was christ in david a rejected king
[1:24:30] it was christ in moses
[1:24:34] it was christ in joshua
[1:24:37] he was showing it it was christ it was
[1:24:40] christ it was christ
[1:24:41] it was christ so i see continuum as they
[1:24:44] were traveling
[1:24:46] and he goes from from from from adam
[1:24:51] praise the lord amen
[1:24:56] he said then now the prophets told us
[1:25:02] that god killed a lamb
[1:25:05] in the east side of eden
[1:25:08] and wrapped adam and eve the lamb was
[1:25:11] christ
[1:25:15] the lamb that ever killed was christ
[1:25:20] the boat that noah bill was christ
[1:25:29] do you remember when abraham
[1:25:33] took his son on top of the mountain
[1:25:36] that was christ
[1:25:45] he was trying to take them from the man
[1:25:49] from the man jesus that they were stuck
[1:25:51] with
[1:25:53] praise the lord
[1:25:57] to show them christ
[1:26:04] praise the lord it was christ
[1:26:08] that gave henry white her sons back
[1:26:12] it was christ that spoke those courage
[1:26:15] into existence
[1:26:20] it was christ a huge georgia cutter
[1:26:29] that's what the attraction on the
[1:26:33] mountain brother branham says
[1:26:34] the attraction has left the man
[1:26:40] he says what is the attraction you see
[1:26:43] the attraction is no longer the man
[1:26:50] attraction is his message
[1:26:54] because the message is the ministry of
[1:26:57] jesus christ
[1:27:05] what think what think
[1:27:09] what thing are we stuck with
[1:27:16] one thing that is so stuck in our minds
[1:27:20] that we think that god has let us down
[1:27:23] what
[1:27:23] think what is it
[1:27:27] what what what have you gone through in
[1:27:30] life
[1:27:32] amen what have you lost
[1:27:37] that you think that god
[1:27:41] has failed you that's the question he
[1:27:44] asked
[1:27:45] what think
[1:27:50] praise the lord
[1:28:02] what was he doing he was carrying them
[1:28:04] beyond the camp
[1:28:06] he was taking them beyond the camp
[1:28:11] because we get so stuck with the camp
[1:28:15] we feel comfortable being in the camp
[1:28:18] but he was taking him beyond the camp
[1:28:23] awful slow of heart
[1:28:28] slow of heart with all
[1:28:31] that god has done for us
[1:28:34] we are slow of heart
[1:28:39] we are slow of heart
[1:28:42] and god designed all that way
[1:28:46] because he wants us to trust him by
[1:28:49] faith
[1:28:49] amen amen he wants us to trust him by
[1:28:54] faith
[1:28:57] now by the things we understand
[1:29:02] but for us to trust him by faith so he
[1:29:05] make our heart
[1:29:08] slow
[1:29:12] and no matter how you shake your hair
[1:29:13] you stick and grab it
[1:29:18] then you look back and say oh i see
[1:29:22] oh i see oh
[1:29:26] a c is when it has already passed
[1:29:33] slow of heart
[1:29:40] what think can anybody stand up tonight
[1:29:43] and tell me what i think
[1:29:48] praise the lord
[1:29:51] even if god do no more miracle
[1:29:58] praise the lord he has already done
[1:30:01] enough
[1:30:02] yes he has already done
[1:30:06] more than enough
[1:30:13] praise the lord he has already done
[1:30:16] more than enough
[1:30:25] even just to give us the opportunity to
[1:30:27] be here tonight
[1:30:29] for us to sit down and talk about these
[1:30:32] things
[1:30:36] so what think what is it
[1:30:40] that is going to happen in your life
[1:30:42] that you're going to throw this bible
[1:30:44] away
[1:30:46] what a game can happen in your life for
[1:30:48] you to get to the place and say there is
[1:30:50] no god
[1:30:52] what can a critic say for you to say
[1:30:54] that no this message is not true
[1:30:56] what think what thing can they bring up
[1:31:01] what thing are you going to deal with
[1:31:06] whenever we get to that place of
[1:31:08] discouragement when
[1:31:09] all our faith is challenged it's because
[1:31:13] you are stuck somewhere in the flesh
[1:31:19] somewhere in the flesh you need some
[1:31:21] pooch you need to be
[1:31:23] pulled up a little bit
[1:31:26] whenever we get stuck in the flesh we
[1:31:28] get discouraged
[1:31:32] you get stuck in the flesh
[1:31:35] all that god has ever done for you goes
[1:31:37] from your mind it's only that one
[1:31:39] problem
[1:31:39] that one problem the one problem that is
[1:31:43] before
[1:31:44] you that's what is bothering you you
[1:31:46] don't even consider the fact that
[1:31:48] you have the breath of life that he gave
[1:31:52] you the breath of life
[1:31:56] what think you want to meet me in the
[1:31:59] office
[1:32:01] for us to talk about it
[1:32:03] [Laughter]
[1:32:07] i can spend the whole night here we can
[1:32:08] get through it i will take you from
[1:32:10] moses
[1:32:11] and through the prophets maybe the law
[1:32:14] might help us
[1:32:16] amen
[1:32:19] are you seeing the picture yes
[1:32:23] yes sir all they were talking about
[1:32:27] you know i mean man i can't believe it
[1:32:30] you you remember you remember on the sea
[1:32:34] you remember that night when the boat
[1:32:36] was toasting
[1:32:38] man he just woke up and said peace be
[1:32:41] still
[1:32:44] all of those things were coming to their
[1:32:46] mind but there was a conflict in their
[1:32:49] spirit
[1:32:50] how can a man that spoke to the wind and
[1:32:52] the will to obey him
[1:32:55] the man has stood before pilate and said
[1:32:58] you have no
[1:32:59] power except what my father gave
[1:33:08] how can a man like that die
[1:33:15] they were so calm i mean such a conflict
[1:33:29] you remember that day when we went to
[1:33:31] buy bread when we came he was talking
[1:33:33] with that woman that way
[1:33:36] was too bad and we're listening to the
[1:33:38] conversation
[1:33:39] he told a woman all the things that she
[1:33:41] had done
[1:33:42] oh my goodness
[1:33:46] oh my goodness
[1:33:50] look let me be very let me be very very
[1:33:52] honest with you
[1:33:56] i was more afraid when i was away from
[1:33:59] him
[1:34:01] than when i was closer
[1:34:04] because you can't hide from him whenever
[1:34:08] i was away i was i was afraid because i
[1:34:10] thought he was he was seeing everything
[1:34:12] i was doing
[1:34:17] and they were talking out of this thing
[1:34:22] but you see they were they were stuck in
[1:34:25] the man
[1:34:25] jesus
[1:34:30] the same man that was opening the blind
[1:34:33] eyes
[1:34:34] and raising the dead it was the same one
[1:34:37] that the prophet said
[1:34:40] he will say my god my god what had that
[1:34:43] forsaken me
[1:34:53] praise the lord
[1:34:56] when god has given you the opportunity
[1:35:00] as a young man to learn
[1:35:03] to trust him for you to begin to
[1:35:06] experience miracle in your life
[1:35:11] for you to be able to experience
[1:35:16] god for yourself
[1:35:23] then you are allowing things like cell
[1:35:25] phone i don't have a cell phone
[1:35:27] i don't have a jordan shoes i don't have
[1:35:32] your light is is is this kind of for
[1:35:34] things you you want to
[1:35:36] bring god into jordan shoes cell phones

[1:35:47] i don't have this dress i don't have
[1:35:49] this weave cap i don't have this
[1:35:51] is that all of those things you want to
[1:35:52] bring god into
[1:36:03] when you as a young man or a young woman
[1:36:07] you have the opportunity to experience
[1:36:12] almighty god
[1:36:15] you don't need to close your eyes you

[1:37:04] heal me and god
[1:37:07] change me you have the opportunity

[1:37:22] jesus was just trying to grab them in
[1:37:24] their thought process
[1:37:27] what was on their mind what thing
[1:37:30] that's why he asked them that question
[1:37:32] to see how
[1:37:33] far they were from the reality
[1:37:37] how far they were
[1:37:46] from what they thought the new
[1:37:54] praise lord i pray that this prayer
[1:37:57] meeting tonight
[1:38:06] we will go and allow the holy spirit
[1:38:11] to speak to our hearts and say one thing
[1:38:15] he says son what thing are you thinking
[1:38:17] about what are you worrying about
[1:38:20] well think what thing is casting you
[1:38:23] down
[1:38:28] like he told abraham is there anything
[1:38:30] too high for the lord
[1:38:32] that's right
[1:38:36] yes when when you come to that
[1:38:39] understanding
[1:38:40] you learn to embrace
[1:38:44] god in your trials and difficulties
[1:38:48] because you know that he have all things
[1:38:51] under control
[1:38:56] amen
[1:38:59] nothing takes him by surprise because he
[1:39:01] knows the end from the beginning
[1:39:03] he's out of our time he knows exactly
[1:39:06] how that situation going to end
[1:39:08] that's the reason why that's the reason
[1:39:11] why when
[1:39:12] when we start when we start misbehaving
[1:39:14] by crying
[1:39:16] and and just instead of just praising
[1:39:18] god and and thanking him and saying lord

[1:39:22] going to end blessed be your holy name
