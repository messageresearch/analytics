from brother john bibi john bb you're welcome um for steven can you please check with me he's coming [Music] praise the lord [Music] not so much of the testimony but the circumstances that led to it coming from my wife and actually i wouldn't say it all if she were here probably she could take the other side of it but i just want to say what lord did for us all it was um before last thursday we got up in the morning after our morning devotion and then after we got through praying i felt that i needed to pray more to me i have not prayed sufficient but you know the ancient to pray it was something unusual to me in the sense that instead of longing to pray i was feeling the prayer longing i said hunger in my stomach so i say wow this is very unusual lord what is going on then i still feel that hunger to pray i say okay but then i have the little girl with with me and once again it's around there's nothing you can do in our partner i don't have anywhere to hide so to have from her i only have a leg uh a closet is dollars so when she's looking alright you can't find me she'll go right there yeah so i think it was around 11 o'clock at that time so by 12 o'clock i found i was still i was still feeling too heavy so i went in the closet to see pick up my bible i can read but you know she likes to play with our phones so she has played with her grammar phone until she has missed where she is so she started looking for me she came and then she brought the phone i said okay maybe go to grandma i'll set the phone and bring it back and she didn't say well she turned around and went to her grandma so after resetting the phone i went out to go and give look for her to give the phone to her when i got out there i saw her and the grandma sleeping i said wow but this is very unusual so then since i have a free chance i will pray then so i grabbed a chair my chair and then i faced the wall now when i got down to pray then i felt real hunger in my stomach i said ah lord what is this so i got up if i say i am going to eat before praying i might sleep over because who can put you to sleep now if i don't eat and i say i'm praying to you the hunger will be threatening you and you can't pray the way you want to so i got up i said okay i will just eat something little then you know i can pray alone but while i was struggling with this uh hungers i said what is this then i remember this scripture that they that test and they that are did a hunger and test for righteousness they shall be filled i say amen so that means not only longing but you can also get physically or spiritually hungry in your stomach to pray so okay so after i took the food i carry to the microwave now when i got to the microwave i said no satan get away from me you don't provide for me now that i want to pray to god you have come in with this hunger in the name of jesus christ i reject you so i put the food one side and then turn around to go and pray when i sat down to i knelt down to break i get lost i don't know how long i prayed but when i got up from praying then i found that i am really really heavily hungry so okay i took the food and then put it in a microwave and warm it the first bite that i took i had [Music] in my mouth i said ah but what could this be we don't cook bones because of the leg there and so this can it be bones what could it be so i use the food is already in my mouth and i use my tongue to search all around whether i can see sharpness you know chickens i didn't find anything i said well satan the bible says i will drink poison it shall do me no harm so this food you can't stop me from eating it i'm going to eat it so i swallowed it not knowing what i swallowed okay then i scooped another spoonful put it one side put soup on it and then i start searching inside to see if i can find anything no i didn't find anything i said okay praise the lord i will eat so i add it again now in the test spoon i scooped the rice and then going to get this the soup i saw this sharp a flash like a glass so when i look at it i said ah i then i took it gently out of the soup whatever i force it in my break i think oh yeah see that is easy it was a piece of broken uh no um bull we had this bull for about four years thick so so i have no idea that you're going to chip around and i don't know how it happened so i said i put it one size in half okay then i continued two years after i already prayed so when i take the food i will look inside look inside i don't see any then i will eat so bit by bit i ate all the food now when i got through eating the food i say well satan well god is on my side so if i have followed your hunger and i have gone ahead to eat the food this is what i was going to get but thank god he's on my side he has taken this away from me so basically that is what happened my wife was still sleeping see so when she got up no when i took the the the test hoop then i started looking around the bowl started looking around then i found out that there's a portion of it it has something like chickens rough i say oh so what i beat through it could be one of these chippings or you know small small chips that i may have mixed with the food okay so when she woke up i was telling her oh she couldn't she started training say oh honey you were not home and are coming to do something to find something to eat and i don't know when you are coming so i try to use a hammer to break you know he doesn't have hands enough to break chicken soup so he was trying to use the hammer to hammer it to i mean marshall and being that she doesn't have the hand so the hammer kind of slip from her hand and then hit the ball so he hit the wall she never realized what had happened see until when he saw the chip the lines on the bowl so she was trimming oh i said did you eat a food did you have the food i said ah why the bible says we shall drink what we shall do has no harm why worried so i act she was not satisfied i said well let's go so i just we just left it there then after i came to church that sunday i waited i brought the chip itself to show to brother jordan if he can be projected he said yeah it can be so i'll talk to pastor if he allows it then you can project it so that you see what i'm talking about i'm sorry i didn't bring the original but just how it is so i talked to pastor explaining to him so oh no you can go ahead so i waited then we come sunday brother ali came to give his testimony see previously he has already preached that uh us hours with moses and then from his accident you are using that how god has been with his children so when you when i heard the testimony oh nobody's testimony it is for me too so i say oh praise the lord so you see when we gather together when something is going to happen you don't know where god will come to bring a warning to us but for one sermon to bring two testimonies it confirms that god is amongst his children so this is what the lord has done for us so either as ours with moses is not only for anybody for us all praise the lord jesus yes it's a dimension of his name jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue confess i mean i just want to be grateful to god for brother john bibi i pray that god will continue to strengthen us all in jesus name that is the power of prayer yes um we have special here but i think i have to skip that because of the time we've gone deep into the pastor's time rather than have something to make right i don't know if you can do that quick brother then are you there yeah so um this morning i rather brought something to my notice and um i said i wait till next week but then i realized i didn't know we had so many specials here this morning else i would have made it next week so i said to myself if i can make you today why not so he said in the previous semester i used a terminology or a term um i don't give a damn yeah so he called my attention to it this morning and asked whether i knew the background of that time i said no he said it has something to do with swearing it has a swearing background or something to that effect and i saw i'm hearing it for the first time i said i appreciate it very very much he said i used it twice by searching through my heart i think probably i have used it over 10 times i don't know where under what circumstances and i have always used it in that context i don't care but it doesn't matter under what context it was what is wrong is wrong yeah there is no place for foolishness behind the pulpit here so i thought i should make it right before the church and let you know about it brother jordan i appreciate that too much god bless you yeah so this is what we should be doing for one another so i had a different thought about it but it just happens that it has a background i i i don't know so thank you so much god bless you and i'm sorry for that church that was very unintentional god bless you amen indeed we are serving in god i want to thank brother then for that correction and brother jordan thank you so let's go ahead and stand while we invite the pastor i want to apologize to sister docas and brother goodwill you guys can have your special today because of time so you can prepare next sunday in jesus name all right seeing the wondrous love of [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] when we all can [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] when we [Music] is [Music] when we [Music] [Applause] when we [Music] get [Music] to reach [Applause] praise the lord amen amen amen amen what a promise what a promise we are all looking up to death amen is going to be in the house of the lord this morning and we just want to thank the lord for giving us this opportunity to come in and serve him again praise the lord amen and water fellowship water joy divine leaning on the everlasting arm let's sing that to the lord praise the lord a fellow shape what a joy divine flaming on the everlasting eyes [Music] oh yes thank you [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yeah [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] praise the lord the lord bless you you can have a seat again we welcome each and every one of you in the name of the lord jesus we want to thank god for giving us this opportunity once again uh [Music] looks like we live in and it's almost like the saying that says the you know the darkest part of the night comes just before the break of the daylight and uh so it looks like we are constantly having one one sorrow or another or one one that is that is coming missing among us uh just on on friday was the funeral service of uh uh or the viewing of the brother that passed away over there in uh in dc and just after that another dear brother pants right after that service from the same church so uh then he's a his father to a dear friend of mine and a good good friend to brother brother miron and so that that is something that is uh uh going through there on the time of sinus so we want to keep them in prayer i saw him when i was there the last time for bernie's funeral and uh i knew him from back in nigeria italy brother so i just spoke with the son yesterday and they all sent you greetings but jarrod wanted me to greet the church as well praise the lord so but uh as the days goes by that the time comes one by one we will all cross this mortal ring until our lord take us in the body change amen whether we go by the way of death or whether we go by the way of the body change is it it makes no difference for the believer it makes no difference for the believer because if they've struck our body just in a twinkling of an eye you step into your new body praise the lord there is no dull moment for the believer while we weep inside you you will step into a new body where you will feel no pain in those sideness just the same as when we go by the weight of the rapture in the twinkling of an eye we will be changed that's what the scripture says but we are in that cycle you know we are in that cycle we are in that period that the scripture says in the moment it's a process you know a moment is a process a moment is uh it's a period of time and what is happening to the believer here is that the more we yield to this word the more we come in fellowship to this world the more we are experiencing our body change but from the inside god is working on our nature because that's the only thing that we take from this world you know is is the change of nature we are not going to go with our nature from our first birth we taking on a new nature from the word praise the lord and that's the reason why we are called to conform to the word you know to the image of the world we talk a little bit about that but uh let's let's just continue to remember many many of god's children that are moaning in sinus there's another dear brother pass over there in new jersey [Music] one of the sisters back home my editor's sister's sister despair she told me about him you know because he uh kind of appreciate the word to her [Music] and then i was looking forward to make contact but i didn't have contact with him until i got a call from back from yesterday and she reminded me her daughter reminded me you know that that was the brother so they had to see him on this side and look to see him in glory praise the lord amen we hold we hold that hope here in our hearts amen praise the lord that we have a promise so uh let's just rejoice in there believing that uh you know our day of comfort and blindness will all sorrow and everything will be taken away let's just buy our house together and just and just prayed as we as you remember those morning families and church that are in a desperate need of confidence trained around this time heavenly father we bought our house lord oh god we you taught us in your word to identify with glory and also lord to identify with uh with those that are mourning solomon said it's better to go in the house of those that are mourning than those that are fisting because when we go we take account that one day we will come to that place and father it is what we do now that counts lord father god and what will be said of us when we are gone what will men say after our back at our bed but lord we just want to cast our all at your feet this morning we pray for uh bershon in the family his wife of god and his sister lord we just pray for the morning church over there in ibadan nigeria pray for god martin's lord you will strengthen him father god and pray for the church in dc christian fellowship lord since they lost your pastor they have just been one sinus or another we ask that god you will strengthen him lord father we know from your word that it takes this moment of brokenness for you to really reach down and get ahold of us father i pray that you will raise them up to be strong christians strong believers lord and a great church almighty god and even the saints over in new jersey and father lord god and many many of your children lord that are mourning for their lost we just pray that your grace your grace and mercy will just be with us father we thank you we appreciate your father we want to commit a service down in your hands we have come lord father to the preaching of your word come open your word to our house lord speak to us this morning in a way that only you can we love you we appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen [Music] thank you musicians that's all we will do for the music and uh let's take our bibles we want to read from saint john chapter one we want to read from sin john chapter one and revelation chapter 3. last week we were talking about we were speaking of uh the day of redemption the blending of time and eternity but we had a parenthesis and we spoke a little bit about dealing with shame and i felt convicted over that thought when i went home i kept thinking about it and uh and the law started dealing with me so i want to go back to death in john chapter one let's read uh a famous uh uh part of that book that we all love verse one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god i want to read that again in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made all things was made by wu the word amen because in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god so we know that that was the form that god took to make all things the word all things were made by him and without him was anything made praise the lord let's drop down a little bit [Music] let's drop down verse 12. but as many of us receive him to them give him power to become sons and daughters of god sisters do you feel comfortable when i say that praise the lord but as many as receiving giving power gives you power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name listening to this which were born net of blood net of the weight of the flesh none of the weight of man but of god so there is a birth of god that is spoken yet about so what john is addressing here does not have anything to do with our natural birth amen the lord bless you you can have your seed we will continue to read it does not have anything to do with your natural birth so don't allow anything of your natural breath your weakness your failure to haunt you this morning because we are going to travel into our identity amen which were born not of blood not of the flesh none of the will of god but i mean not of the word of man but of god then verse 14 and the word was made flesh endured among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth revelation chapter 3 revelation chapter 3. revelation chapter 3. revelation chapter 3 let's read from verse 14. and unto the angels of the church of laodicea write these things said the amen the faithful and truth witness the beginning of the creation of god now take that phrase the beginning of the creation of god back to saint john chapter one you will see that the very one that john was talking about in the beginning was the word the word was with god he created all things he is the one identifying himself here in the age of low edition so it's the same identity are we together the same one that was made flesh and dwelt among us is the same one here as the beginning of the creation of god what was the beginning of the creation of god the word the word was the first form that god created if we would say that way condemns himself to so so this is our age the dish church age the thing that came to us in our age is the word that's the reason why the seals were open in this age the mystery of god was revealed in this age because the identity of this the identity of christ in this age is the same one from the beginning are we together that is the reason why i will make this emphasis because that's what i will be emphasizing on that is the reason why if you miss the word you miss everything because that is the identification of christ brother branham says jesus christ is identified in all ages and the identification of christ in all ages is his characteristics praise the lord his form may change because he may use a jeremiah uh an ezekiel uh uh uh uh isaiah and all of these different prophets of the old testament he may use the paul that john wesley and uh at william branham he formed a change but his characteristics remain the same and we know god characteristics by his word because that is his identification card are we together so the things that have come to us in every age god identified himself this is god now speaking to laodicea age and said this is my identification laudisha see my id card my id card is that i am the amen which is i'm the confirmation i'm the one that closes everything i am the truth and uh it's almost like when the police say give me your license let me see your license the lookout you look at your face look down again that license look at the name look at the date of birth and everything there's god's identification he identified himself to the laodicean church age and say i am the amen and the truth the faithful witness i am the beginning of the creation of god it's almost like when jesus said go and baptize in the name of the father son and the holy ghost praise the lord if you want to rightly carry out that commission you have to find out what is the father son and the holy ghost if you rightly want to identify god in your age you have to find out what is the aiming what is the truth and faith for witness what is the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation of god is what john says in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god all things were created by him are we together now so let's let's let's read that the introduction to our age again unto the injured of the church of laodicea write this thing said amen the faithful and truth witness the beginning of the creation of god i know that works that thou i need a call on heart i would that there were cold or hard take a position that would be better so then because they were that i look warm and needle cold not hard i will spill thee out of my mouth because they are said i am rich and increase in ghouls and i have need of nothing but knowing that that thou are wretched miserable poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me go try in the fire that thou may be rich in white dreaming that thou may be closed and that the shame of that nakedness i'm going to speak on the age of shame this age is the age of shame praise the lord and white raymond that thou mayer be closed and that the shame of the nakedness do not appear and anointed eyes with eyes said and that they may see for as many as i love are trusting i rebuke and trust and be zealious therefore and repent amen so this morning we want to talk on the age of shame praise the lord the age of shame and this age is the greatest age of shame praise the lord we know it is the last age bible historians will tell you that too so and then yet in this age of shame is also the age where god brought one of the the his the greatest manifestation the greatest move of god came in this age praise alone because the the the laodicea church age to the church to the word is allowed this church age to the church is actually the pentecostal age is the age of the restoration of the gift praise the lord amen is the age of the restoration of the gift if you if you ever read about the the outpouring of uh of what happened uh during the time of azusa i mean it was it was something that uh those that had the privilege to witness it the describe it extraordinary extraordinary just like people would talk about being in the meetings of brother branham that's just how those people there during the meeting of uh the the azusa street i mean they will see the cloud of glory coming in in the service there was they will see the cloud of glory the that song the comforter is here the comforter is here i learned that was brother simon's song that he used to like you know they just sit right there they keep singing the comforter has come their comforter has come and they would just keep worshiping they keep worshiping the atmosphere discharged there were there were tongues and interpretation of tongues on the spot prophecies and and i mean the gifts were just flowing among the people it was not man it was the move of god praise the lord it was the move of god and that was the same thing that took place on a brother brandon ministry you know it was god moving from one level brother branham taught us that in the message the countdown he says luther age was using the hearse you know the hearse and uh and and the boogie you know they were using the hearse he said john wesley age horsepower increased you know and and and they made the the the vehicle what signs they the only benefit they saw how hearses were moving and if you put two hearses together it can be able to pull more than what one would pull and and if you double them they will have more power so science benefit on there to be able to give us a vehicle praise the lord and and that just more horsepower and then in the pentecostal age that was extra horsepower that takes men from on the ground and suspend him in the air that was the aeroplane age a man going into the heavens so the church that's how the church was moving it's not that the church was copying after science science was benefiting from the women what what what the church has already achieved or what god has already achieved in the life of the church it was re it was reflected in science because before anything happened on earth is already reflected in heaven praise the lord so even as you see in the natural life you see signs is advancing we have in we have in we have in syria we're having you know uh uh uh uh gps we having all of these things it is just a physical manifestation of how far the church is praise the lord you and my son may not be there but that's how far god church is are we together so when we see all of these physical manifestation it must just challenge us because it's just physically reflecting what is happening in the heavens are we together praise the lord there is more that is expected of us people than church members this is our age this is the age that expects to see the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of god there is more that is suspected of us than just saying i believe the message i'm baptized in jesus name this age is looking to see you calling the old testament scenes from the grave brother branham says we are the final voice to the final age and the final voice is the voice of the resurrection so this church is going to provoke the resurrection for a rapture that's what it's a specter of us we have to live a life that will provoke a resurrection amen a life that will provoke the healing of our body a life that will provoke strength to our body that's the day and age that we are living in that's the thing that is expected of us praise the lord we must challenge ourselves we must be like they are all saints and says i know i'm not what i'm i'm supposed to be amen i also know i'm not what i used to be praise the lord i'm having an expectation to get to where god wanted to be are we together so this is an age of shame this is an age of shame this is the age where uh uh i mean man has detolerated in their conduct praise the lord a decency has gone you know what i'm talking about i'm not going to go into all of that just i just want to uh uh play out some things here but you will realize that what what i want to what i want us to see here is that just like this age it's an age of shame this age is experiencing such a shame that no age have experienced it is just like when she was first experienced i think we all know where and when shame was first experienced that's the garden of eden because the scripture says that they had a holy veil on their face brother branham taught his dad and and they didn't they never knew that they went naked so they did not know shame amen it's just like a little baby that child don't know shame that try to stay in a state of innocence praise the lord they can run run all through the house and you see the physics oh no come back don't go there you don't have clothes on you you you know shame so you you feel embarrassed for the little child to run but the child don't know shame a little baby don't know nothing praise the lord adam and eve never knew shame praise the lord genesis chapter 3 that will be the first time that they will be exposed to shame let's read a little bit of genesis chapter 3. praise the lord genesis chapter 3 verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one why she took off the fruit thereof and eat and gave also them to her husband with hurt and he did eat and the eyes of both of the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked another sense is that they became shameful praise the lord they got a sense of shame they knew they were naked and they saw fake leaves together and made themselves april and they heard the voice of god walking in the garden in the cold of the dead and adam and his wife hate themself from the presence of the lord among the trees of the garden they were hiding themselves because of the hashem praise the lord they were dealing with shame in the wrong way are we together the way to deal with shame is not to hide it's a reality with it is to confront it is to separate because what shame does is that shame try to give you a different identity his shame tries to change your name amen he tried to change your countenance shame gives you a sad identity and you forget your name and you says i'm i'm embarrassed have you ever heard people say i'm embarrassed embarrass is not your name he says i'm i'm embarrassed and some i'm very embarrassed the first thing is very the last name is embarrassed so shame gives you a new identity so the way to deal with sheen is to separate yourself from shame and realize that whatever is making you shame is is an act it's something that you date and it's not you it's something that projected from you even god is not right are we together so they were dealing with shame here the wrong way the bible says he heard the voice of god and hid himself from the presence of the lord and the lord god called onto ottomans and said unto him where were there and he says i've heard a voice in the garden and [Music] i was afraid i was afraid i'm ashamed because i was naked and i hate myself and god said who told thee praise the lord that thou were naked amen who told thee so there is another person that is identified there in the scripture who told me are we together well i'm i'm not a grammar still struggling to speak right but i think you can think over that a little bit so this is the first time that shame was introduced amen this is the first time you think about it delayed in such such an uh uh a state of ignorance or uh uh you know a state of purity pure conscious never taught about evil never thought about anything going wrong praise the lord and to realize that they have find themselves in this oh my goodness we are naked it's all that is coming to their mind this is how we have been all this why oh my goodness they ain't in the struggling for fit leaving everything but then as as the scripture when goes on we realize that god the bible says he says who told you that that was naked they have eaten of the tree he says and uh [Music] and the man said the woman the past the bald around we know all the dead and the bible makes us to know here over in verse 21 and and unto adam also and his wife that the lord god made a coat of skin and clothed him so this is god's way of dealing with shame man's way of dealing with shame is too high amen is too high because i mean they have taken that identity of shame and embarrassment god way of dealing with shame is to identify himself with you amen make a provision are we together so he took a shift skin and he came down and and made a sacrifice and he approached them and we know he dressed them took them off of their shameful fake leaf and then he pulled a coat skin on them so genesis chapter 3 that was the first time man was introduced to shame yeah we we in the loudly short age a man is at the peak of shame praise the lord i mean he's are the pig they have done everything i mean there is not there is nothing under the sun that they have not done shameful praise the lord i'm not dwelling on the acts of shame because we know them praise the lord and we have no reason to pollute our mind with the acts of shame that's not what we are here for for the mother of fat we all deal with shame and what we are here is to approach god's matter of dealing with shame because that is the only provider way that he had made and until we we we we deal with shame in god's provided way you can never get out of shame unless god reached down his hand and bring you out of a shameful thought a shameful desire a shameful habit you can never get out all your provision and things you will make is just a fake leave god was the one that came down to deal with the first chain and he has to be the one that will deal with sheen all the time i'll take you back to saint john chapter one here the scripture says we read here in uh uh genesis chapter 3 verse 8 and they heard the voice of god walking in the garden in the cold of the day now so what did god say to address their shame his voice his word amen what the god said allowed this shot is to address a shame the beginning of the creation of god which is the word the word there was shame in the beginning the world is dealing with shame in the end because the only way to get man out of shame is to dress man by this world not by the church membership the only provision that god have to get you out of shame is to bring you under the covering of the word of god that was the way he addressed it in the first time and that's the way he would address it in all ages in every time he always deal with shame by his word praise the lord are we together amen let's read this together oh my goodness i know i'm in trouble again i know that um but branham said this in the in the church-ish book listening to this he said this in the church age book exposition of the church ages he said for in every age the church goes astray and it is not just the leite but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheeps in every age the church goes astray not just the lightest but the collegiate group the shepherds are wrong just as she then god brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministry of these seven men which is the seven golden candlesticks the seventh church is messenger okay so just like as it was in eating adam went astray just as eve went straight are we together and that is the way the church both the clergy and the shepherds but god brings himself on the scene god don't send a man he brings himself on the scene but he will himself brother brandon said when the first son of god was lost in the garden of eden he did not send an angel no he came down himself but he took a form and what was that form the voice of god was walking in the cool of the evening that was the form he talked the voice of god calling adam adam where are you because he had a provision to be able to deliver them from their embarrassed past praise the lord amen the bible says when god dress out underneath they never went back hiding they went walking the bible says they went walking he took them from out of hiding dressed them and they went walking are we together i'm trying to make emphasis because i want to grab your attention on something yet as we travel down then god blames himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministry of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth so in every age the tendency of the people going in error and even the past test glory in era is dead in every age praise the lord the way to get out of error is to listen to the voice of one of these seven men the man of our age the messenger of our age the tendency of going into error is there are we together so god use one of these men and lead his people back to truth and the abundant power of that truth like paul said the gospel never came to us in words alone but by the demonstration of the holy ghost praise the lord we have truth but we need the abundant power to be able to live that truth so he comes and lead his people back to that abundant power god in his people all of his people not only in the clergy but all of his people for if any man has not the spirit of christ he is none of his he is the word that will be the word recognized in the people that is god's identification in every age the word recognized in the people are we together praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we serve amen now this is what i want to show you is in john chapter 1 we read in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god now see the word the only identification in in the book of matthew might you identify jesus christ as the king it is in the book of matthew where the wise men came where is he that is born king of the jews in the book of mark mark identified him as the the seven jehovah seven are we together in the book of luke luke identify him as the son of man it's luke that says in the day when the son of man is revealed are we together praise the lord in the book of john john identified him as what the word in the beginning was the word are we together now so you see here the identification comes in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us saint john chapter 2 jesus goes over to a wedding at canada and mary and his mother says i mean the wine is finished the people are complaining the powder just out of the wine is finishing and she says you'll go to him and and one of you praise the lord are we together amen and uh and we know what happened there amen he says woman my time is not yet amen that was the correction he gives to to marry his mother woman my time is not yet but then she told them and says everything that he asks you do it right amen whatever he asks you do it but this will almost be the second time where jesus will be correcting mary the first time we know as a little boy when it went over to the sacrifice she came in and she says your father and i have been looking for you praise the lord amen and he's and he said which which of course will be the very smart very smart way for the child to talk to a parent don't you know i should be about my father's business amen amen brother branham says indeed the word jesus being the word corrected the error are we together so is the same reflection year when she spoke he said woman my time is not yet the word always corrects the error that is an identification of the word of of of the word of god in your age the identification of the word of god in your life is that it will always correct the error the world will tell you that that thing is not right this thing is not right it's contrary to the word of god it will always correct the error because that's the identification of the word that's in john chapter 2. saint john chapter 3 the word again nicodemus meets jesus he comes by night and said master we the pharisees know that no man can do these things until god be with him praise the lord right there in chapter 3 now the word was introduced in chapter one chapter two the word corrects the error of chapter three the word require at birth that you must be born again are we together chapter four the word brings deliverance to a woman i might make you to be interested in reading st john when you go home because you see the word going from one chapter to another are we together but what are we talking about it's the word dealing with sheen we spoke a little bit about that last week the woman of the world she was dealing with sheen she tried to cover it with religion we the pharisees or we the the the samaritans we worship on this mountain you say it is dead in jerusalem that she tried to cover hashem with church membership but she was dealing with the word the word got under her sleeves and say i have water that i can give you you will never have to come back here praise the lord the word identify her needs that's what the word is said for our age that's why god sent a prophet it's not for us to be identified with a church or identify with a movement it's for us to get for this world to get ahold of us praise the lord she says well give me some of that water so i won't come back yet again i can just stay in my little corner and i will now have to come back out again the word say okay go and call your husband oh my goodness he hit the main thing that was embarrassing here [Music] that's that's the way the word is praise the lord i mean that is the way the word is choose not to read the bible god will use the son to preach the word to you he will use the things happening around your life [Music] praise the lord he said go and call your husband we know the story she says i don't have a husband say oh yeah you just said the truth when he said you just said the truth see the peace that came over here then he said you high five even the one that you are with now what was the word doing the world was not embarrassing her because she was already embarrassed the word was delivering her from shame praise the lord the word was dealing with her problem to deliver her from shame when jesus said that just like i said last week the woman just brushed a lie shine in she shouted come and see the man they have told me the things that i've done the very things that she was shameful about the things that she had kept to herself all her life now she was ready to tell everybody he told me everything i believe some of her friends said what was some other thing praise the lord amen so god always sent his word in every age because since eating since she was introduced every age has dealt with their shame praise the lord abraham there was shame when he was caught that he lied that sarah was not his wife praise the lord he had to deal with that shame amen i've been like sent for him why you had to lie to me every age how to deal with shame but there is not an age that is that have there was shame like the kind of shame that we are dealing with in our age praise the lord amen we can all say praise the lord and thank you jesus that your grace has brought us out amen oh we have recognized the message of our day we we have seen it but we still live in the age we still have to go to the grocery stores we still have to do our our our work on the internet we say we we i mean we're in the age and all of these things are all around us praise the lord every day the enemy tried to throw a shame on our lap and see how you're going to deal with him sometimes it's not an act that you are in sometimes he goes to your memory and talks something that you did in the past and throw it in your life and say deal with it because every day we have to overcome shame praise the lord and then he starts working on your mind he starts he says get to your feelings and making you sorry for yourself and making you all to feel so embarrassed you don't even want to remember that it was even you that did that the lord but how did god deal with shame by taking the identity of the word praise the lord every time there was shame he took an identity of the word are we together saint john chapter 6 the word was rejected that's what jesus said on the bread of life the seven i am came right in between there i'm the bread of life i'm the i'm i'm the living water if any man drink of me he would church no more out of your bella would burst living water that's what he said saint john chapter 7 also it was other great feasts that was where he made that that uh that that proclamation that out of you will flow living water if you come and drink from him because he's the water of life in john chapter eight we talked about it last week also that was what he did with the woman that was caught in adultery saint john chapter four the the the word there with a shame saint john chapter eight it did with a shame a woman caught in adultery seen john chapter 12 he also there with hashem another woman that came and pulled an alabaster bus on jesus's head all of that is a type of the church the word in john chapter one is delivering the church of hashem all the time it's the only thing that can that can restore us back to god are we together brother branham said this god's way have been made for us he says i tell you i tell you friends there's been many men and it's tonight that's coming down to the end of the road we'll find out that that little shallow religion that you are holding onto won't work praise the lord that little shallow religion i believe the message amen brother branham is is my prophet it's just a shallow religion because there is something the word is requiring us of this age god vindicated brother branham dedicated the message around the world around the world this is a vindicator message whether you believe it or you walk away from it the message is vindicated the message is dedicated behind the curtains of time there were scenes that said we are resting on this praise the lord behind the curtains of time there are sins that said we are resting on this so it is not your decision now that is going to make god to reverse his vindication but ben says and we read he says again there's many of men tonight that are coming down to the end of of the road and we find out that that shallow religion that you are holding on to won't work nothing short of being born again nothing shocked of being born again and what is being born again at birth of the word now the birth that makes you to belong to a church a breath of the word now born the flesh now born the blood not born of man but born of god he says nothing short of that will work jesus said except a man be born again of the water and the spirit he will in once enter the kingdom of heaven praise the lord are we together mark of the beast 1954 brother brandon says i found the church standing in its beauty this is revelation chapter chapter one he's describing you jesus in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks that's what he's going to talk about saw the church standing in his beauty christ just molded into it christ in bright form the church standing in building christ just molded into it and the church had a white garment and you notice it was a woman around the breast amen that's the one that john saw in revelation chapter 1 christ in the midst of the golden candlestick having a lamb tied around his breast are we together around the breast aha the gummy covering over hashing so you see when christ came in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he met the church in sheen so he gave the church himself as a covering praise the lord amen he gave the church himself as a covering covering over her sheen and it had a golem called true pulled around it that held it around the breast white speaking of the righteousness of christ and the golden cod represents the gospel the preaching of the gospel bringing the holy spirit over the church the righteousness of christ hold it there tie the strings amen the gator strange praise the lord the gospel being preached breaking the righteousness of jesus christ to do what covered the church he became sin for us that we might become his very righteousness the way to deal with shame is not to make excuses no is to find a provision of the word what has the word provided for me to deal with this situation what is in the word i would take what the word has provided let the devil blast my mind with whatever he wanted i would take what the world has provided he became shame for me so i might be his very righteousness i was together in the midst of the golden candlesticks he come as a covering to the church he covers the church by himself praise the lord that's why branham used that statement over and over this christ in bribe form because it's the church is the bride but it's christ in the midst this age of shame praise the lord and it's also the same age with all the churches and all the denomination and all the things that is there this age is also a shame of him there is no age that have been ashamed of the name of jesus christ like this age people want their their their christian life to be a secret life they want their faith to be a secret life because they don't want to offend people if the message delivers you from shame you cannot be ashamed of him praise the lord amen amen people would rather stay in their shame and hide themselves come to the liberty of jesus christ receive the grace of god the baptism of the holy ghost and yet we are ashamed of him the one that has brought his righteousness to cover our nakedness we are ashamed of him we want to make people to think that it's our way of life instead of letting them to know that no this is not me it's him it's him i'm a very disgraceful person i'm a person of shame filled with lost and filled with uh evil talks and filled with he is the one that has covered my shame why should i be ashamed of him during the time of the reformation those people were the little that they knew about christ they little didn't kneel they wanted to they wanted to go into danger areas they wanted to go to places like korea to bring the name of jesus go to places like china they wanted to go behind the iron curtain behind the the places where they could be killed because of their faith just the little they had they never knew nothing about the mystery of god they never knew nothing about baptism in jesus name all they had was i accepted jesus as the lord and savior they were not ashamed they were ready to die for their conviction but this age has received the greatest revelation of god their son of man manifesting in our age and showing grace to the world bringing a pardon and yet we are ashamed we are ashamed of him we are so conscious of our own pride we think about our reputation and we are ashamed of him that's the age of shame the enemy has flipping around because he knows that the message has come to bring us out of shame so now he's making us embarrassed of the one that has delivered us rather brag on the name of a church or brag on the name of a pastor instead of breaking on the word this is the thing that has delivered us from our shame praise the lord amen you can have the message book you can have the seven seals and the seven church edges under your arm if you never met the word in person you will have those message book the pillow of fire picture and still live in shame i've seen embarrassing embarrassing things that have been done eating in homes we leave the message book on the counter the bible on the table and we stay used in certain words we force ourselves to say we we have never heard the name of jesus christ it's an evidence that this world is not taking place in our life the identification of christ in all ages is the word of god this world must be changing us it must be changing us let's see what paul says romans chapter 8 verse 29. praise the lord paul said in romans chapter eight see paul speaks here about the image that we are conformed to are we together amen verse 28 he says for we know that all things work together for good to them that love the lord to them who i call i call into to his purpose for whom he did for known he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son what is the image of his son in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word took on flesh and came among us the image that we're supposed to be conformed to is the word it's the word it's not this image for the model of fight this is just a painting it's just a painting the reason why we use it in the message is because brother branham said his first vision that he had of the lord jesus was exactly like huffman picture it's just a painting so what image are we to be conformed to the word of god the message of our day that is the image of the dear son that has come to us is not to wear our beer like this keep our head down long first corinthians chapter 11. let's do a little bible study here i will leave you in the next five six minutes praise the lord first corinthians 11. paul speaks here 11 7. we're talking about conform to the image he says for the man indeed are not to cover his head for as much as he is in the image and the glory of god but the woman in the glory of the man praise the lord amen now if you look at this we know that the bible make us to know in genesis chapter 1 that god created man in his image male and female created he did that's what the scripture says so why is paul saying here that the man is created in the image of god and a woman in the image and the glory of the man why is he saying that paul is only talking about his he's not talking about original creation because in the original creation according to genesis chapter 1 26 when god made man in his image man was both male and female so the thing that paul is addressing here is his that was the same thing he spoke in ephesians chapter 5 where he says the christ is the head of the of the man the man is the head of the woman that's the same thing he's addressing here so what is he saying christ the word is the invisible image of god that is the head of the church praise the lord amen because the word is reflecting the father praise the lord so if the man submit to the word the world will have influence on him praise the lord and he will be able to project the father and then the woman will come on a subjection that's what paul is dealing with here the image is to come under the word let the world be our hair shape amen are we together second corinthians chapter three you can't change anybody the word for the man for god to deal with the inner part of a man or the woman is not in the hands of any martyr that power is in the word you want god to change your wife submit to the world you want god to change your husband submit to the world come under the hair shape of the world then god can flow through that channel and have influence ii corinthians chapter 3 verse 18 paul comes again he says verse 17 now the spirit of the lord now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty praise the lord but we all with the open face beholding us in the glass the glory of the lord are changing into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord what image the word it comes back to the word is the word that is changing us from glory to glory brother branham said is making us better husbands it's making us better wives in making us better sons of god better daughters of god that's the purpose of the word to change us for us to walk from glory to glory it's the image read the book of deuteronomy chapter 6 god told the children of israel i never took any form when i came to you i never took the form of a bird i never took the form of any heavenly creature praise the lord the uniform chapter 8 eternal chapter 8 the only form that i talk was when i spoke to you from the mountain and that's where the familiar scripture comes from men shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god the word of god is the greatest form of god among the people you know why god esteemed job the book of job testified he extended the word of god above his necessary need that was the identity that was the thing that god saw in job and man that extended the word of god the regard he had for the word of god the love he had for the word of god we can just love this word in our mouth the prophet said the bible says we must submit to the word the word must be reflected in our life that is the thing that changed us from glory to glory is bringing us out of our shame we are not ashamed of him we can testify out of him we can talk about him praise the lord amen we are not dressing the way we dress because our church wants us so no you get it wrong it must be because the lord jesus praise the lord i'm dressing like this to please the lord jesus oh no in a message we can do this although in a message we can do that it becomes a slogan among us praise the lord until when we are in the camera of the message we have in one form of life when we go away from the camp then we have a complete different form of life but you have to know that you can never go away from the presence of the world because david said where can i go to hide myself from thee if i make my bed in hell be all you are [Music] there what is the message of the hour christ is the mystery of god revealed the word among the people the world living in our homes collusion chapter 3 verse 10. praise the lord paul says this collusion chapter 3 verse 10 amen oh my goodness my pages are sticking together my hand is trimming okay paul says this when he speaks of the word in this in this in this light and in this form and it's almost the same thing that we read over in john chapter one paul brings that out clear to us is by the word that everything was made amen people church that's the greatest thing that has come to us in our age this message of the hour is jesus christ in the midst of the people amen this message of the hour is jesus christ and that's where he's bringing his church also that's how god deeds washing he deals with shame by coming to identify with you praise the lord you know jesus talked about a story about a good samaritan when he walked down there and he saw that man the priest come and saw the man and realized he's not a church member even if he's a church man but he's not supposed to be in that condition so let's just leave him this tribe came the one that knew the world saw the man but when a good samaritan came he identified himself when god came in in the garden of eden he never left adam and eve he dressed him and for him to address them he had to identify that's how god deals with sheen brother brandon said you have to step into a man's shoes he said i look at that blind man there in india no shoes on his feet i thought about my father i look at my feet look at his feet my shoes won't fit him or as i would take off my shoes and give it to him the way to deal with shame is not to leave you across the street is to identify with faith but you know so many other times we we act like pharisees we don't want our white garment to be stained our garment is so white on the outside that we don't want it to be stained so we can only sit down and talk about the person praise the lord and sometimes that's the reason why it's it's even difficult when we're struggling in ourselves when we're dealing with personal shame it comes and give us an identity it gives us a new name then he says i'm just embarrassed about myself you know you talk to you talk to yourself in your mind and you know you know and you know and the devil keeps working on your mind all you have to do go to the word the word has a provision and the way the word deals with our shame is by identifying himself christ came in the midst of the seven goalie candlestick and he became the covering when the prodigal son came back the father left from on high ran down through the city and he covered his son why because the book of the tournament required that if he comes back they should stone him to death when he comes to the city so the father was willing to take the stone for the son that's how god deals with shame praise the lord brother branham irish and davos one of the most embarrassing subject that a prophet of god will preach he talks about it and he talks about it he says many of my good friends sitting down here and knowing that it was a difficult thing he had to go to god that was the same way that moses did with it he had to go to god going on behalf of the people identifying oneself with the needs of the people and said lord yes the people that you have given me many good friends of mine are caught up in this father will you be merciful give us a pattern be merciful identifying oneself with the needs of the people moses put himself in again and said god if you kill these people you have to deal with me that's the way to deal with shame because the people have become a shameful people before god complaining arguing many of us young families we're living in a shameful age sometimes you catch the young people doing shameful things praise the lord learn how to deal with shame even when you catch yourself dealing with shameful things bring it to the world because that's what your covering is praise the lord that's where your covering is sometimes we parents young parents we having high expectations for our children and those expectations put a lot of pressure on them and sometimes when they are caught in shameful things always go as a covering that that child can trust you to be able to tell you what they are dealing with if you separate them from yourself this is embarrassing it's just this is not in our family it's you make them a stranger when god saw our shame of adam and eve he came down he never left in the heavens he came down and his voice was walking in the garden adam where are you he didn't say bring yourself here you are an embarrassment i don't wear you you are an embarrassment to this family i put you over this place see see what you have done bring your naked self here god never did that he says where are you adam where you have been i've been all around looking for you boy where are you what's happening what's going wrong trying to make him comfortable for him to speak out because you will never deal with shame praise the lord with a wrong attitude because he was a holy god he came with a bleeding line recon reconciling adam back to his presence he had a bleeding line that stood before them and he wrapped him in that blouse came and the ones that were hiding could now walk before god they walk before god and brother brandon says when god looked down and saw adam and eve walking from his presence he said i would have to calm down one of these days and identify myself with my bride that's how god deals with shame that's why there was nothing enough that god could send to the laodicean age by himself he came himself in the form of a humble ministry a humble kentucky ministry he came himself took a prophet from a life of shame brother branham says the name branham was a shameful name in jeffersonville because my father was a drunkard everybody knew the branham name all we do was just drunk and fight with dance but god has to meet him and take him from the sheep god he sees one time i was so ashamed to walk through the street i was so ashamed to even tell people i'm a brandon nobody will be my friends he says now i have to even hide myself to get rest because why god identify with him cover the shame and make the thing that was shameful and glory that went around the world seven times and that's the thing that has pulled us in this place is that word that's the thing that is working on us dealing with our shame praise the lord that's the reason why brother branham says there is one person i can break on jesus christ there was no no ministry lifted the name of jesus like william branham he said i hope it's the only thing that god has against me because i brag on jesus a lot he said somebody said well then branham you brag on jesus too much he said i hope it's the only thing that god has against me but god has to take him from shame taking from a shameful family past and god turned that shame into glory and i believe he can do the same today praise the lord amen if i mean if we just if we just pass the you know pass the mark around i mean yeah i mean there are things that we will talk about today praise the lord i just hope you shut the youtube channel down because you're still writing amen now there's there are things we could talk about today that would just that mean it would just blow the whole youtube channel off because things that have never been heard but yet god has brought us out of those shame he's turning our shame into glory praise the lord he has given us beauty for arches the lord of joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that's what isaiah said let's turn to our feet amen musicians you can come let's buy our house together [Music] peace of god cover me cover me cover me let the peace cover me you [Music] peace of god let the peace [Music] oh oh heavenly father lord jesus we want to thank you father that you have made a provision in our age father when you came to our age lord you identified yourself as the beginning of the creation of god father lord god we want to thank you father for the prophet messenger we want to thank you with god for the message of the hour we want to thank you for the the holy ghost lord
