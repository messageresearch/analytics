from the outside now to this first man so now look you know when you was a few years ago about two three years ago before you accepted this you was well thought of amongst the people you lived a good clean life any girl in this city want to go out go out with you because it felt clean and decent I stand before any of them I never insulted one never said anything she even acts smart I take her home

longer and it'll be gone and he's a Healer your own flesh and blood one word from him would save the baby's life he's a Healer you said the people try to tell you the preacher told you he was all messed up you was all insane you was become a religious fanatic and you said he loved you could he love you and how you cried for your daddy how night after night you fasted and when you in daytime when you'd have to pray to get up a pole to work and when you let him Die In Your Arms of [Music] Sinner how your wife what a fine woman she was and how you loved her Billy's mother many of you remember home what a fine girl she was how happy you was in your little home over there about or $8 worth a Furniture what furniture you had but yet you loved her you and you love one another and you went prayed for others in some mly emotion they got up and walked away and said they were all right but now your own wife and there she is dead second day now laying in the Undertaker's establish down Scott MCS he's a Healer huh and your little boy at the point of death Billy Paul 18 months old and your little girl at eight months old is laying here dying with menus and you just prayed and God pulled his sheet down said shut up don't hear won't hear you at all turned his back on you he's a good god huh he loves you and every girl you ever went with every boy you ever associated with your very best friends has walked away from you as a religious fanatic everything he was telling me was the truth everything that he would say just all right in line see here I'm just then about ready to say then that's the way he has to act then I won't serve you just as said that there was something come from somewhere else way down on the inside said who are you to begin with the lord gave and the Lord taken away see that's that Inside Man don't reason it all I look back and I thought how do I get on Earth I come from a bunch of drunkards how did I get here who give me life who give me that wife who give me that baby where did my wife come from where did my life come from I said do you slay me yet I'll trust him I said get wave me Satan I laid my hand over on the baby I said Shar honey I'll lay you on your mother's arms in a few minutes when the angels of God comes to take you away but one day daddy will see you again I don't know how going to be honey I can't tell you how when he turns his back up on me he won't even hear for you he let my wife gu me holding her by the hands crying for her and my daddy and his arms died on this arm right here looking up at me trying to get his breath and I praying as hard as I could how could I face the public again to preach Divine Healing how could I preach it was a good God to let my own daddy die sinner how could I preach it I don't know how I know he's right the word of God shall never fail it or try it no matter what that is then I know there was something inside of all reasonings something inside of all emotions everything else like that there was an inside man that help in that hour nothing else could have done ever reason ever think it be showed everything of pro that it was wrong and I was in the wrong but the word of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world held on the inside I felt a little wind come through the building Spirit went to beat god brother sister let me tell you that's the only thing don't try to reason out don't try to have long hair because I said so don't try to do these things just because in your flesh don't try to do it just kind of cope up but just wait before the Lord though something we there on the inside many of you think cause you to got long hair that means you're going to go go to heaven that doesn't mean that many of them thinks because you're a good moral woman you go to I don't mean that many of them think because there churches and belong to this and this great groups and great doctors of divinity that don't mean that see many think because they speak with tongues they've got the holy ghost that don't mean that though the Holy Ghost does speak with tongues but until that real genuine Holy Spirit in there will cope with every word if that Holy Spirit in you it makes you speak with tongues looks back and doesn't agree with the rest of the word then it's a Rong it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the beginning in the beginning of the creation of God when God be to create bring you into existence you see you started back there as a seed and worked down to where you are now and then you were all in Christ then when Christ died he died to redeem all of you and you are part of this world and how can if the Bible all of it precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little not one shot or TT shall fail how in the world can you be part of that word disagree with the rest of it or any part of it God bless you I've over time now I didn't mean to do is keep you that long sorry I kept you not sorry for what I say we're right at the end of something friends all of you here I guess it's just a members here of the church I don't get around time to see what members there is I imagine all of your constant comers here let me tell you something Happ will you spare say six more minutes is that reverent Mr old Walker here from Argan that was here that that Sunday I was share it anybody know about Mr Dr strange thing I come down here there many many people in I I had I had a pile of interviews like and every one of them worthy they're children married drunkards and and different things and just things that was worthy every one of them should have been seen I can't do all that I commit you to God and hold my hands toward him oh God I I couldn't do it get to them Lord do uh you know how to do it I pray for each one Billy called me and I just come in with brother Banks he said Daddy you you and look I see people drive out there sometime in the lane looking and I look out at them and wave at them like that and they almost turned their head I don't want you to do that the other day when they was buying that place out there Tucson from me living brother Tony had a place up I want buy me for about three or four times what this place cost he wanted to put in so many thousand on it himself but the only way he get in there a gate man is standing out there a great big well aition up there but any the people lives there you have to have a written permission then this Gat man calls you and see if it's all right them to come in I said could you imagine me my brothers and sisters who come to see me that wants to shake my hand and ask God's blessings for me and you could you imagine me put myself in there Tony he said what do you have I said Tony the way the church and all of them has the people not to come around I said that's for people who got everything they want me to do they they say well the Lord told me Hallelujah I'm going to stay right here glory to God uh uh the Lord told me you have to hold a meeting over here in our group yes sir glory to God the God told me that if you don't do it brother BR you're your backslid me and there trying to study see that's why see and a many a good person gets beat out of coming in because of that that's right just like a man going hunting now you're on a farm a farmer say say come on and you can hunt and he get out there and shoot one of these cows a rabbit run cow and he shoot the rabbit anyhow you get up on the fence instead of going to post and climb over like a decent man should do climb up on the fence and break it down like that see and then he say I post a place I I don't blame him on bit not one bit well what does he do he keeps the decent hunter from coming in it's always that way it's the evil that keeps the good from having the primin it's always now but then people are thousands of really needy and nice people loving people full of God's grace now we have this uh how these people come
