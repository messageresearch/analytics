[0:43] Matthew 24 24 said that the two spirits
[0:46] in the last days the church Spirit of
[0:49] the church people and the bride Spirit
[0:51] of the Bride people would be so close
[0:54] together to see the very elected if it
[0:57] was possible that's how I post look how
[0:59] it's come through the stone now notice
[1:01] we're going to type something here
[1:02] Luther in the church age of bringing
[1:05] forth the bride's seed was the same in
[1:09] spirit just one little grain of seed
[1:12] Luther stood out on that was
[1:14] justification by faith
[1:16] he was a very type of Hagar the stall
[1:20] notice Wesley was type of Sarah the
[1:24] Philadelphia in the stage of love that
[1:26] brought forth the tassel that in
[1:28] Wesley's ages more missionaries than any
[1:30] other age we've had the great missionary
[1:32] age of John Wesley's time but Pentecost
[1:35] represented Mary Mary the last stage of
[1:39] it now she was not the seed amen
[1:44] yet the life of the seed was in her yeah
[1:48] but it hadn't matured yet
[1:51] I feel very religious
[1:53] [Music]
[1:59] but you wasn't matured
[2:01] so is it with our Pentecostal age that
[2:03] we're living in
[2:04] there's got to come forth of a word of
[2:08] God that's inner undenominational
[2:10] outside of the rims of that denomination
[2:14] Luther went to husk with his first word
[2:16] the just shall live by faith Wesley had
[2:18] two words
[2:20] sanctification second death network of
[2:22] Grace Pentecost said the third word the
[2:24] restoration of the gifts but the entire
[2:27] seed has to come forward
[2:29] see how they denominated on one more
[2:31] than another word in another word but
[2:33] there's got to be some that cannot be
[2:35] denominated it's the entirety of the
[2:37] life
[2:39] do this itself again
[2:40] [Music]
[2:42] there cannot be any more Church ages
[2:44] after this we're at the end brothers and
[2:48] sisters
[2:49] we're here we've arrived thanks be to
[2:52] God Amen
[2:55] now we see these things are just as true
[2:57] as they can be
[2:58] still we notice then if her being the
[3:02] fossil or uh Wesley being Apostle
[3:05] Pentecost then being the chef which is
[3:08] the next stage of the coming fourth of
[3:11] the grain but brother sister the stalk
[3:14] is not the green
[3:16] neither is the Apostle the grain
[3:18] neither is the shut the dream so each
[3:22] time it matures it looks more like the
[3:24] grain
[3:26] the stuff don't look like the green
[3:29] then What comes forth to toss a little
[3:31] bow it looks uh more like the green than
[3:33] the than the blade does What comes forth
[3:36] next is shut it holds the grain it
[3:39] nurtures a green now looking back here
[3:41] at the promise God made to
[3:43] Abraham of thy seed speaking spiritually
[3:46] any of us know that
[3:48] he's speaking of Christ not Isaac
[3:52] through his face see notice the first
[3:55] was by a bonds woman
[3:58] doesn't look anything like the promise
[4:00] God don't have to take back his word for
[4:02] nobody
[4:03] God said how it would come in that's
[4:05] where it'll come
[4:07] Sarah being a representative of the
[4:09] church type of the church it she found
[4:11] out there that she said well I believe
[4:13] this is a little too phenomena I just
[4:15] can't even believe in that so you go get
[4:16] Hager and you take her for a while see
[4:19] now that stop didn't look like the
[4:20] promise at all but when Sarah came forth
[4:24] now that looked pretty good
[4:27] it looks a whole lot more like the
[4:29] promise there but still it wasn't the
[4:31] genuine promise because Israel in Isaac
[4:34] failed and denied the genuine seed when
[4:39] it come on
[4:40] Hallelujah
[4:42] don't get excited don't run that won't
[4:44] hurt you
[4:46] denied the sea crucify him and hung him
[4:49] on a cross
[4:51] just like Paul said here did not the the
[4:53] seed of the of the free woman or the
[4:56] bonds woman persecute the seed of the
[4:59] free woman and so does the seed of the
[5:02] denomination persecute the genuine green
[5:04] it's always got to be that way they're
[5:07] not be heirs together they're not
[5:09] associated together they're absolutely
[5:10] two different promises two different
[5:12] times two different peoples all together
[5:14] one's a bride and the other is a church
[5:16] no comparison at all with him but still
[5:19] they are not the seed that's promised to
[5:22] come neither was Sarah neither was and
[5:25] neither was Hagar neither Sarah was or
[5:28] or neither Mary was deceiving
[5:31] Mary was not the seed
[5:34] she was a carrier of the sea but she had
[5:37] nurtured brought forth out of her wounds
[5:40] just like the chef brought from its womb
[5:43] the real seed but the shock is not the
[5:46] seed
[5:48] it only is poster to the Sea it's hugged
[5:51] up around the sea way back in the stall
[5:52] the life is scattered all through the
[5:54] stalk
[5:55] and when it comes to the pollen it's
[5:57] gathered down kosher but when it comes
[5:59] to the shook it's right down there like
[6:01] the seed it forms are almost like the
[6:03] seed amen Jesus told us what would be in
[6:05] the last days be so positive to see the
[6:07] very elected if possible but then the
[6:09] seed comes forth from there and the shut
[6:11] the life leaves the shut and the shuck
[6:14] is a carrier and that's just exactly
[6:16] what our denominations has been a
[6:18] carrier Luther Wesley Pentecostals and
[6:22] now it's time for the seed to come forth
[6:23] notice
[6:25] notice just she was not the seed Mary
[6:28] was not just a sharp tassel installed
[6:31] carriers a part of the word not all the
[6:35] word Lutheran justification Wesley had
[6:37] sanctification pentec also had the
[6:39] restoration of the gifts but when the
[6:41] word now they could produce that the
[6:43] justification will save a man you
[6:45] believe that
[6:46] sure is the character of the word it
[6:47] seems I believe the stalk is part of the
[6:49] week
[6:49] sure it is but it's a carry it ain't
[6:51] alive
[6:52] then long-come sanctification how many
[6:55] believes in sanctification you feed the
[6:56] Bible you have to sure so still that's
[6:59] not it's a little more like that's two
[7:00] more words
[7:02] but then come the Pentecost the
[7:04] restoration of the gifts speaking in
[7:06] tongues they call it the initial
[7:07] evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[7:08] tongues now they call that the initial
[7:10] evidence which brought forth the what
[7:13] the shook
[7:15] but they denominated
[7:18] but when you come to say I'm a father or
[7:21] one and these other things then the
[7:22] shark pulls away from it
[7:25] but the real genuine bride Church
[7:28] we're praying forth the entire word of
[7:30] God
[7:34] or he's the same yesterday today and
[7:37] forever
[7:38] notice
[7:40] in the wombs of Mary was a seed
[7:44] but when the seed was delivered
[7:47] it said I come to do the will of him
[7:50] that set me
[7:51] I'm my father of one if I do not his
[7:53] Works believe me not there was a seed
[7:56] which one of you can condemn me of
[7:58] unbelief what the Bible's promise I do
[8:00] I've done it
[8:02] God has verified that through me he said
[8:04] who can tell me now see but the the seed
[8:07] and Mary the shock it was close to being
[8:10] that but it wasn't
[8:12] they were still in the womb
[8:14] notice that in the Pentecostal age to
[8:17] the Lutheran age to the Western age it's
[8:20] been the same thing to this Pentecostal
[8:21] age now over but at the opening of The
[8:25] Seven Seals
[8:27] Revelations 10.
[8:29] the full word is to be born into
[8:32] manifestation again
[8:33] and Vindicated by the spirit of God
[8:37] in the full strength as it was when he
[8:39] was here on Earth manifested in the same
[8:42] way doing the same things that it did
[8:44] but it was your order amen
[8:47] Hebrews 13 8 said Jesus Christ is the
[8:50] same yesterday and forever
[8:51] in Saint Luke 17 30 Jesus said in the
[8:54] last days as it was in the days of Sodom
[8:56] when the son of man will be revealed in
[8:58] himself again it'll be the same thing
[9:00] the wars in a silent condition and the
[9:03] churches went into solid with it like
[9:06] love and his wife and I say that there
[9:08] is an elected church somewhere this
[9:11] world is strong and set aside from those
[9:13] things and the manifestation of God is
[9:16] attracting this tension we're at the
[9:19] last days
[9:20] shook us give forth his strength into
[9:22] the sea this one oh not it was a good
[9:24] shot but it served his time
[9:27] see it is the word bride or the word
[9:30] groom
[9:32] the natural Seed of Abraham Isaac and
[9:35] Jacob and our national sea Brother
[9:37] official natural seed of Isaac and so
[9:41] forth had to go into the ground in order
[9:43] to to bring out this other bring out
[9:46] Jesus and so has all these others the
[9:49] seeds has to dry and I mean the Chucks
[9:52] has to grind the pollen has to dry and
[9:54] everything dies so the seed can produce
[9:56] itself
[9:58] that's the way it's been in every age
[9:59] denominations has been the carriers of
[10:02] part of it for that is the word for it
[10:06] has been hid from the wise reformers
[10:11] or the sealed away from them until the
[10:15] age of the eagle is appear
[10:18] the Bible said so
[10:20] yes sir cause we're promised that in
[10:22] Malachi 4. that's exactly we are he's
[10:25] hidden from the eyes of the wise and
[10:27] prudent as we just went through the book
[10:28] of the revelations we find out that
[10:30] every all three of those Messengers or
[10:33] those beasts that went forth each one
[10:35] suited Luther just right each one see to
[10:37] the other and just right which is The
[10:39] Oxen the different animals of the Bible
[10:41] it went forth the justification
[10:43] sanctification even into the
[10:45] Pentecostals but the fourth was an eagle
[10:48] that's right and to that age God raised
[10:52] it up
[10:53] so it has to come to that age to be
[10:55] correct yes sir the eagle promised being
[10:58] fulfilled of of Malachi forward Jesus
[11:02] was not of Mary
[11:05] but came through Mary
[11:09] like the life through the show
[11:12] now many you find Catholic Brothers your
[11:14] sisters tonight maybe you think that
[11:16] Mary was Mother of God as you say she
[11:18] was how could she be the mother of God
[11:20] and God had no beginning
[11:22] and who he is
[11:25] who was the father of God then if she
[11:27] was the mother
[11:29] he was her creator
[11:33] and she was not his creator
[11:37] he created himself in the womb of Mary
[11:41] not her own creation it was he created
[11:45] himself he was not of her but she was of
[11:49] him
[11:51] that's right the Bible teaches us that
[11:53] all things were made by him and not
[11:57] nothing was made but what was made by
[11:58] him
[11:59] how do you have a mother
[12:02] when he was God himself
[12:04] now we see here the true revelation of
[12:07] the true type there's three women
[12:09] carriers of the natural seed until the
[12:12] matured into Jesus how Ishmael could not
[12:16] be because he was born really in what
[12:19] we'd think today out of wedlock because
[12:21] he was a bonds woman son then come a
[12:23] little more like him like Jesus which
[12:25] come out Isaac but it still wasn't
[12:27] because it was born to the sex between
[12:28] Sarah and Abraham but then Along Came
[12:32] Mary by the Virgin birth produced Jesus
[12:35] Christ that's right God the word made
[12:38] flesh now look there were three women
[12:40] there's three women tied here churches
[12:43] the women always types churches means
[12:46] three denominational ages carriers which
[12:49] also must die and dry up is like the
[12:53] shock and so forth does to give room for
[12:55] the seed to seek and not yet right
[12:58] cannot get right brother until the
[13:01] stalking leaves are all dry
[13:04] that's right it saps every bit of the
[13:06] life in them out
[13:09] [Music]
[13:10] all it was is that plus
[13:13] cannot do it now it's seed time or bride
[13:17] time
[13:18] the Shucks are dead the Shucks are dried
[13:21] up the Virgin word time
[13:24] not touch it's a virgin remember a
[13:28] virgin word time if you put in the hands
[13:31] of a denomination it sure won't be
[13:32] virgin
[13:33] it'll be manhandled time you get to it
[13:36] but God's church is not touched by the
[13:39] nomination
[13:40] hallelujah it's a virgin born of God
[13:44] made manifest Jesus Christ the same
[13:47] yesterday today and forever
[13:49] Hallelujah
[13:52] how wonderful I love it I believe it I
[13:56] know that it's the truth
[13:58] it'll not be touched there'll be no
[14:00] denominational manhandling in the Virgin
[14:03] birth of the Bride
[14:05] no sir she's she's commanded by God to
[14:08] cut out such
[14:09] that's not their unclean things that
[14:12] come vultures
[14:13] just reminds me his eyes coming from
[14:15] Phoenix the other day coming to Tucson
[14:17] from the meeting the spirit of God
[14:19] called my attention to something that
[14:22] wife and I were going along talking and
[14:24] the children were asleep in the back of
[14:26] the car getting late called my attention
[14:28] to a hawk
[14:31] and I watched that Hawk a little bit and
[14:33] studied him he's a very type of the
[14:35] church today
[14:36] now the hawk as we all know has lost his
[14:40] identification of his original creation
[14:42] that's exactly right once he was similar
[14:46] to an eagle his greater brother a hawk
[14:48] was but now he doesn't fly in the skies
[14:52] no more Honey's Heavenly manner
[14:55] but he has gotten soft
[14:59] he don't fly in the skies anymore he
[15:01] hops on the ground like a vulture amen
[15:04] sets up on a telephone pose
[15:07] pops along hunting for Dead Rabbits yeah
[15:10] yeah the Hulk wasn't made to do that
[15:13] no he was made that is similar to an
[15:15] eagle now this is like the church it was
[15:18] made similar to The Eagle it should take
[15:20] the place in the heavenlies but instead
[15:22] of that it's got soft
[15:24] you don't fly into the unknown no more
[15:27] into the blue
[15:28] no sir it's depending on its modern ways
[15:31] of adoption of education and Theology of
[15:34] some man-made denomination looking for a
[15:36] bunch of Dead Rabbits half rotten that
[15:38] something else
[15:42] that's right
[15:45] see that's what tells the eagle hasn't
[15:47] changed a bit he stays the eagle
[15:50] he doesn't soar into the sky as a hog
[15:52] does anymore to catch his fresh Manna up
[15:55] there but he depends on what he can find
[15:57] already dead a hawk don't know how to
[16:00] say supposed to get on the ground but
[16:01] watch an old Hulk today go down along
[16:03] the road you see the telephone wire
[16:04] setting full of hawks see if he can find
[16:06] something something's killed something
[16:08] rotten something he's got so he is not
[16:10] Wings enough to fly he's the first thing
[16:13] you know he'll be on the ground all
[16:14] together grounded because he's got soft
[16:18] he don't use his strength the more that
[16:20] God give him his special identification
[16:22] was to sail into the skies and watch
[16:24] down from below but now it gets down
[16:25] below it can't even look up he's got his
[16:28] mind on Dead Rabbits to find out what he
[16:30] can find on the road some skunk possum
[16:32] or something somebody's run over
[16:34] he's not an eagle but he's something
[16:37] like it just like the church depending
[16:39] on his food for education and so forth a
[16:42] dead diet that died years ago through
[16:44] Lutheran Wesleyan the Pentecostals and
[16:46] gone is looking back for some man-made
[16:48] Creed instead of flying up into the
[16:51] heavenlies of the word where all things
[16:53] are possible to them that believe
[16:58] he's tuck up the habits of the Buzzard
[17:01] them dead things is left for the
[17:03] vultures of the world
[17:05] educations and so forth like that was
[17:07] left for the world not for the church
[17:08] he's so soft he don't ain't rugging no
[17:11] more he can't get up into the rugged
[17:12] heavenlies where all things are possible
[17:14] to them that believe he sets back and
[17:16] said well doctor so-and-so said certain
[17:18] my denomination don't believe it that
[17:20] way oh you perverted Hawk
[17:24] [Music]
[17:26] afraid just break out upon the promises
[17:29] of God you say well the days of Miracles
[17:32] has passed
[17:33] you're soft you're scared to take your
[17:37] Wings of Fire or have you come to
[17:39] yourself for a prayer meeting have you
[17:41] come to a place that you're scared to
[17:42] stay over 10 minutes at the order
[17:45] hop along like a vulture
[17:48] eating dead a carrying on the ground
[17:52] yes sir he's too soft to take the rugged
[17:55] Beyonds anymore hops like a vulture and
[17:58] eats vultures food that's what it is
[18:00] that's right until he's beginning to
[18:02] look like a vulture he acts like a
[18:04] vulture
[18:05] [Music]
[18:06] he ain't no more hope than nothing
[18:09] he's more like a vulture and he is a
[18:11] hawk a hawk's supposed to save
[18:13] not set on a telephone pole and watch
[18:15] for a dead rabbit
[18:17] thank you I popped up and down the road
[18:19] like a vulture all right that's just
[18:21] about the way the church has today lots
[18:23] of years are going up there sailing
[18:24] around when I get rabbits here
[18:26] but they're dead
[18:29] they're contaminated one time they were
[18:32] good
[18:33] so was the doctrine of the Lutheran
[18:36] Wesley and the Pentecostals
[18:37] why are you eating like a vulture there
[18:40] was new man of felt every night of the
[18:42] heavenlies or the children of Israel as
[18:44] they turn in anything left over was
[18:46] contaminated
[18:48] will you say the country got wiggle
[18:50] tails in it there's too many them wiggle
[18:53] tales in our experiences today our
[18:55] religions depending on what somebody
[18:56] else said but somebody else did and the
[18:59] promises for some other age man come to
[19:01] me not long ago a Baptist preacher up at
[19:03] my house and said you know I said I just
[19:05] want to correct you on something I said
[19:07] why I said you're trying to teach an
[19:09] Apostolic Doctrine over in this age said
[19:12] the apostolic age ceased I said when
[19:15] it is I'll tell you when it begins you
[19:17] tell me when it cease
[19:19] I said you believe the word he said I do
[19:22] I said all right now on the day of
[19:24] Pentecost do you believe that's an
[19:25] Apostolic age start he said I do I said
[19:28] then the speaker of apostle Peter said
[19:30] these words and remember Jesus said
[19:32] whosoever shall take one word out of
[19:34] this or add one word to it his part will
[19:36] be taken from the book alive that's a
[19:38] preacher or somebody's got their name on
[19:40] the book I said Peter said repent every
[19:43] one of you and be baptized in the name
[19:45] of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[19:47] and you shall receive the gift of the
[19:49] Holy Ghost for the promise is to you and
[19:52] to your children and to them as far off
[19:54] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[19:56] call
[19:57] when did it go out then
[19:59] it's always been in
[20:01] it's a bunch of hawks that's turned out
[20:03] to be buzzards they're popping around on
[20:06] some other dead carcass
[20:10] some other age kill for him
[20:13] right not fresh Manna From the heavens
[20:15] anymore they don't want it they they
[20:17] can't have a prayer meeting not Eagle to
[20:19] begin with salt not rugged just hops
[20:23] around
[20:24] so is our modern denomination dependent
[20:26] on education
[20:27] there are some man-made theology to
[20:30] explain all these things away and they
[20:32] accept that
[20:33] you won't take the word that said Jesus
[20:35] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[20:37] forever you won't take Malachi 4 and you
[20:40] won't take all these other promises
[20:41] pertaining to this day and said how the
[20:43] church age how the prophet said it shall
[20:46] be light in the evening time
[20:49] they don't take this they want to hop
[20:51] around a lot some Pentecostal
[20:53] organization killed a hundred years ago
[20:58] that's right it's no good
[21:01] notice
[21:03] the church is so carnal feeds itself on
[21:05] worldly a Karen dead things of the world
[21:08] is like the vulture does Church politics
[21:12] they don't let the Holy Ghost send a man
[21:14] to a church they have to have a politics
[21:15] and see if the denomination is going to
[21:17] receive him or not that's right
[21:19] they're like the world they're dressed
[21:21] like the world they look like the world
[21:22] they act like the world they're vultures
[21:24] like the world they're lazy soft
[21:25] compromisers
[21:27] that's all there is to it do you ever
[21:29] see an eagle compromise no sir
[21:32] get another genuine Christians
[21:36] till he finds it
[21:40] yes sir he'll find his knee he wants
[21:43] fresh Manna he'll get out of there and
[21:45] dig till he finds it you'll fly higher
[21:49] if it's not in this Valley he'll raise a
[21:51] little heart
[21:52] the higher you call the more you can see
[21:54] so it's time for Eagle to this day to
[21:57] get the flying higher

[22:10] on saying this the other the Holy Spirit
[22:12] has more right away in the church than
[22:14] nothing
[22:15] no more prayer meetings no more agonized
[22:17] with God to fulfill his word no more
[22:20] believing that the word is still the
[22:21] same yesterday today and forever they
[22:24] just vulture eyes down got into
[22:25] denomination put their name on the book

[22:34] hawk that's a similar brother to the
[22:37] eagle the prophet that brought the true
[22:38] word and manifested it relies on half
[22:41] rotten man-made theology
