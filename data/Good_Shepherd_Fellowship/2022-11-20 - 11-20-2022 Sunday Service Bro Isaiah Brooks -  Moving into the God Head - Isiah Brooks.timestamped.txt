[1:03:05] Colossians 2
[1:03:07] Colossians 2.
[1:03:11] appreciate the musicians and
[1:03:14] most of all I appreciate the Holy Spirit
[1:03:28] God is good
[1:03:36] as I was saying
[1:03:38] last night I don't have to feel him to
[1:03:41] know he's walking with me
[1:03:43] but I still like to feel him touch me
[1:03:45] every now and again
[1:03:47] amen
[1:03:48] we appreciate the Lord Jesus
[1:03:53] and try to pick up for where we left off
[1:03:55] last night
[1:03:56] I wanted to bring something different
[1:03:58] but that's not what the will of the Lord
[1:03:59] is
[1:04:00] so we'll go with what he wants for
[1:04:03] certain
[1:04:05] Hallelujah he just directed us in a
[1:04:08] somewhat a different way but I pray that
[1:04:10] the word of God will find a place of
[1:04:12] rest in your heart
[1:04:14] Colossians 2
[1:04:17] we're going to start reading at the
[1:04:19] ninth verse
[1:04:23] for in him dwelleth all the fullness
[1:04:28] of the godhead bodily
[1:04:34] that means the entire fullness of God's
[1:04:36] nature dwelt in that body amen
[1:04:42] and ye are complete
[1:04:44] in him
[1:04:46] which is the head of all principalities
[1:04:50] in power
[1:04:53] in whom also ye are circumcised with the
[1:04:57] circumcision made without hands and
[1:05:00] putting off the body of sins
[1:05:03] of the flesh by the circumcision of
[1:05:06] Christ
[1:05:08] buried with him in baptism
[1:05:12] wherein ye also are risen with him
[1:05:16] through the faith of the operation of
[1:05:18] God who have raised him from the dead
[1:05:21] now we're not talking about water
[1:05:23] baptism here we talk about spiritual
[1:05:26] and you being dead in your sins
[1:05:30] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:05:34] have he quickened together with him
[1:05:38] excuse me have he quickened together
[1:05:40] with him having forgiven you all
[1:05:43] trespasses
[1:05:46] you know that
[1:05:49] I I I look at like the edit like this if
[1:05:52] you're going to read the word you need
[1:05:55] to believe the word
[1:05:57] through you don't need to figure it out
[1:06:02] you take it for what it says
[1:06:05] and God will work it through you
[1:06:09] let us pray
[1:06:12] father God we thank you for your grace
[1:06:14] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[1:06:17] for the sweet spirit that I feel in this
[1:06:20] place
[1:06:21] oh God I pray that you bless this church
[1:06:23] abundantly Lord continue to give them
[1:06:27] Grace continue to Lord help them grow oh
[1:06:30] God we thank you for all things let your
[1:06:33] perfect will be done in this place this
[1:06:35] morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:06:38] amen you may be seated
[1:06:43] we know that we are may we can't make it
[1:06:47] without Grace right
[1:06:51] we're speaking on last night about
[1:06:53] moving into the godhead
[1:06:57] taking our position on the throne
[1:07:01] and of course we realize by God's grace
[1:07:03] that uh
[1:07:06] something has to change
[1:07:10] because we have used Grace as an excuse
[1:07:13] for disgrace
[1:07:16] I'm gonna say it again
[1:07:18] because we constantly say Grace Grace
[1:07:22] Grace
[1:07:24] and oftentimes we
[1:07:26] live like liberals
[1:07:29] that's true uh because we know God is
[1:07:33] the forgiving God
[1:07:36] but our Prophet has also told us that
[1:07:38] there is a line you can cross
[1:07:43] and we know that throughout the church
[1:07:45] ages Grace was so given
[1:07:48] because they didn't know neither did
[1:07:51] they understand the perfect will of God
[1:07:56] they didn't have a prophet
[1:07:58] they didn't have a vision
[1:08:01] amen especially in our time
[1:08:04] so they didn't know what God's will was
[1:08:08] and the Bible uh said that you know
[1:08:11] without a vision
[1:08:13] the people perish
[1:08:16] and we know by God's grace amen that the
[1:08:19] vision in which God gave us
[1:08:21] was not to return back to Egypt
[1:08:25] it wasn't even to continue to wander in
[1:08:29] the wilderness
[1:08:31] it wasn't even to just cross into the
[1:08:34] Promised Land
[1:08:35] but it came it was to obtain yes
[1:08:39] the promise
[1:08:41] you know it was like
[1:08:43] Joshua and Caleb give me my mountains
[1:08:47] I want my inheritance
[1:08:50] and that's what the message of this day
[1:08:54] has come to do is to bring us into our
[1:08:59] inheritance
[1:09:00] Hallelujah not by uh uh Power
[1:09:06] not by Mike
[1:09:07] but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:09:11] everything we do
[1:09:13] has to be done by the holy spirit is
[1:09:17] that right Jesus even said I'll do
[1:09:20] nothing except I see my father do it
[1:09:23] first
[1:09:24] and when I see him do it that's when I
[1:09:27] will do it
[1:09:28] God deals with us in so many different
[1:09:31] ways
[1:09:33] but we must not get our lines crossed
[1:09:37] yeah
[1:09:38] yeah in this day and time we've come to
[1:09:42] do something that no other generation
[1:09:46] has ever done
[1:09:48] and that is to defeat death yes
[1:09:53] yes Jesus defeated death
[1:09:55] and when he defeated death we defeated
[1:09:58] death
[1:10:00] every victory that Jesus Christ gained
[1:10:03] yes sir everyone he won we were with him
[1:10:07] as I said yesterday
[1:10:09] and this has to be more than something
[1:10:12] that we love to hear
[1:10:15] it must move from the head yeah
[1:10:18] Into the Heart
[1:10:21] Hallelujah you see
[1:10:24] entering into heaven
[1:10:28] without the Deni without the divine
[1:10:30] nature of God
[1:10:32] is not even possible
[1:10:34] I'm gonna say it again
[1:10:36] entering into heaven that's right
[1:10:39] without the divine nature of God is not
[1:10:43] even possible
[1:10:45] because the Bible says no unclean thing
[1:10:50] hello somebody
[1:10:52] no Liars no thieves no gamblers no harm
[1:10:58] on this none of that filth
[1:11:01] will enter somebody help me it is
[1:11:05] we're dealing with uh
[1:11:07] absolute
[1:11:10] phenomenon
[1:11:12] how can this be done
[1:11:16] can a leper change his spots
[1:11:19] absolutely not it's not something we can
[1:11:23] do
[1:11:24] but God can
[1:11:28] this is why we need him
[1:11:31] the nature of the divine nature of God
[1:11:35] we've seen that in people you know add
[1:11:37] to your faith virtual knowledge y'all
[1:11:38] know how it reads
[1:11:40] and the Bible said that in all of these
[1:11:43] virtues amen dwells in within you
[1:11:46] you would never be Barren neither will
[1:11:49] you fall
[1:11:51] hello
[1:11:53] when I hear that
[1:11:55] I hear Perfection yes
[1:11:58] I hear something that is to me is
[1:12:01] impossible for me to do
[1:12:04] how many of y'all know what I'm talking
[1:12:05] about for those of us a man who's
[1:12:08] experienced law
[1:12:10] what it is to be under the law in the
[1:12:13] message
[1:12:14] um
[1:12:15] so y'all get quiet on that one
[1:12:18] Hallelujah
[1:12:25] Hallelujah also they bound us with
[1:12:28] Spirits yeah
[1:12:30] yeah and these Spirits amen were lost
[1:12:33] laws that they themselves couldn't even
[1:12:36] keep
[1:12:38] Hallelujah if the Pharisees couldn't
[1:12:41] keep their logs well then the Pharisees
[1:12:43] of our day can't keep theirs either
[1:12:46] right is that right because the Bible
[1:12:49] tells us that all have sinned and come
[1:12:52] short of the glory of God
[1:12:55] and when John looked for someone to open
[1:12:58] to take the book and to loose the seals
[1:13:01] amen he said he could find no one
[1:13:07] so no matter how righteous you think you
[1:13:09] are no matter how holy you think you are
[1:13:12] you're not worthy
[1:13:16] within yourself you're not worthy
[1:13:19] there's only one that was found worthy
[1:13:23] Hallelujah and that one is Jesus Christ
[1:13:27] Hallelujah he took the book he lost the
[1:13:31] seals Hallelujah and what was the seals
[1:13:36] the revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:13:39] in a nutshell
[1:13:41] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:13:47] you and I must understand
[1:13:50] that the thing that God released was his
[1:13:52] life
[1:13:56] Adam and Evil
[1:13:58] call it
[1:14:00] the toilet but it was literally the life
[1:14:03] of God
[1:14:05] that was taken away from him because had
[1:14:09] the life of God remain he would have
[1:14:11] never died
[1:14:13] so God had to take Hallelujah is that
[1:14:16] right that's why Paul said if this
[1:14:19] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I've got
[1:14:22] a building you see for years we thought
[1:14:26] we had this building that constructed
[1:14:28] like man we didn't understand I got a
[1:14:30] body
[1:14:32] I've got a body with y'all know what
[1:14:34] that means that means no more suffering
[1:14:38] no more pain no more heartache no more
[1:14:42] stress Hallelujah and no more getting
[1:14:45] old
[1:14:49] yes I look in the mirror I'm like boy
[1:14:51] you ain't the same
[1:14:56] maybe inside but not outside
[1:14:59] Hallelujah but we all grow old
[1:15:04] and y'all love it
[1:15:07] no nobody in here likes to grow old
[1:15:11] right brother Hallelujah
[1:15:14] but it is what we have to do because
[1:15:16] it's the curse that in itself ought to
[1:15:19] make those who don't believe believe
[1:15:23] right let's move on
[1:15:26] now you and I must understand
[1:15:29] this message is so great far beyond what
[1:15:32] I say the way Pentecostals believe
[1:15:35] because how many of y'all remember you
[1:15:37] know when you went to church those of us
[1:15:38] who went to the Pentecostal Apostolic
[1:15:40] Church
[1:15:40] um we we went there for the music
[1:15:44] oh we didn't want to admit that
[1:15:48] but no matter how good the preacher
[1:15:50] preached
[1:15:51] if we didn't get that don't don't
[1:15:53] don't don't
[1:15:55] don't don't don't don't don't don't
[1:15:56] y'all remember that oh we
[1:15:59] you had to come out with a shout now
[1:16:02] and if you didn't have a good shout or
[1:16:05] dance and if the anointing wasn't high
[1:16:07] enough for you to speak in tongues you
[1:16:09] thought man they should have got a
[1:16:11] better preacher
[1:16:12] we blame it all on the preacher
[1:16:15] but you see that's the way people our
[1:16:17] mindsets are now
[1:16:19] and they fail to see that the Holy
[1:16:21] Spirit Reveals His secrets in simplicity
[1:16:26] you get what I'm saying because remember
[1:16:29] when they Israel when Israel when they
[1:16:33] just had the Manna they never understood
[1:16:35] it anyway
[1:16:36] when they had the Manna flowing they
[1:16:39] weren't satisfied and they wanted meat
[1:16:43] and what did the meat do
[1:16:45] it made them sick
[1:16:48] why because it wasn't meat in due season
[1:16:52] is that right that's what made brother
[1:16:54] Branham different from all the pre
[1:16:57] he had all kinds of stuff locked up in
[1:16:59] his spirit
[1:17:00] things Revelations and understandings of
[1:17:03] the word but he couldn't preach it
[1:17:06] until the season
[1:17:08] presented itself
[1:17:10] this is what has happened Amen in the
[1:17:13] message
[1:17:14] it wasn't time for certain things to be
[1:17:17] spoken
[1:17:19] and the people were still children
[1:17:23] it's like taking you know a baby and
[1:17:27] feed them meat now I I know what you
[1:17:30] said well eagles eat meat
[1:17:33] that's what people say
[1:17:35] but the point is
[1:17:37] how many of them
[1:17:39] at that point or that Junction
[1:17:42] we're real eagles
[1:17:44] that's right
[1:17:46] that's right see we all have potential
[1:17:49] to be Eagles
[1:17:51] but until a birth comes yes
[1:17:54] until a change comes
[1:17:56] you can't eat it like you you know you
[1:17:59] know if you if you're alive as an eagle
[1:18:01] you can eat it like an eagle
[1:18:03] somebody help me
[1:18:14] because what we did and I'm gonna go
[1:18:15] back with it like I said yesterday we
[1:18:18] have married a system
[1:18:20] many of us
[1:18:22] we know the quotes
[1:18:24] we know how to dress
[1:18:26] come on somebody we all sang the same
[1:18:29] songs
[1:18:32] that in itself wrong
[1:18:35] you don't have to sing this song because
[1:18:37] they sang it
[1:18:38] you sing the songs that bless your
[1:18:40] church
[1:18:42] oh come on somebody let's show
[1:18:45] right but we all come and we just you
[1:18:47] know I can't hardly stand it I can't
[1:18:49] hardly stand it you know when when I
[1:18:52] know that when the Holy Ghost comes it
[1:18:55] takes you out of your order and puts you
[1:18:58] into his order
[1:19:00] but what we have done systematically we
[1:19:04] have done just like all the others we
[1:19:06] tried to control the Holy Spirit
[1:19:10] somebody help me
[1:19:12] it's true and we took conduct in order
[1:19:17] and killed the people
[1:19:22] we forgot
[1:19:24] brother Brandon said you ought to least
[1:19:25] get out of order
[1:19:27] to get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:31] and understand this you're not going to
[1:19:34] get a birth in here being lukewarm
[1:19:38] there's a certain temperature
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:42] Church Must produce in order to bake for
[1:19:46] somebody to receive a bear
[1:19:51] come up in here
[1:19:54] with the Catholic spirit
[1:19:56] the Baptist spirit
[1:19:59] the Pentecostal spirit
[1:20:01] Hallelujah that ain't what you want
[1:20:04] you got to go higher
[1:20:08] y'all understand what I'm saying all of
[1:20:11] those things were good
[1:20:13] but the charge of the Living God should
[1:20:16] never be called Dead
[1:20:18] somebody help me here you say oh
[1:20:23] the messenger messenger and gone ever
[1:20:25] since 65.
[1:20:27] y'all understand what I'm saying how far
[1:20:30] have we moved
[1:20:35] how if we haven't moved something's
[1:20:37] wrong almost right y'all better hear
[1:20:39] what I'm saying
[1:20:42] how far how far have we moved and the
[1:20:44] reason me is because we still got people
[1:20:47] amen holding on to the Past most of all
[1:20:50] we've got people who will not forgive
[1:20:55] Hallelujah and if you don't forgive God
[1:20:58] can't forgive you
[1:20:59] [Music]
[1:21:02] all better hear what I'm saying
[1:21:04] because the Bible said no matter how you
[1:21:07] pray no matter how much you want to fast
[1:21:09] no matter how much you shout no matter
[1:21:12] how much you dance in the spirit if
[1:21:14] you've got an art against your brother
[1:21:16] you got the fiction
[1:21:19] somebody help me here
[1:21:30] that needs to make it right
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] see I'm a preacher I can say that
[1:21:42] but let me break it down to you
[1:21:45] it comes down to an individual affair
[1:21:54] let everybody do what they got to do
[1:21:57] but you keep yourself right
[1:22:01] give me somebody
[1:22:02] I'm talking about coming into the
[1:22:04] godhead
[1:22:05] y'all understand me
[1:22:08] you ever thought about why the book was
[1:22:10] called the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:22:13] because only Lambs were in the book
[1:22:20] amen no goats in there
[1:22:25] it didn't say the farm Book of Life with
[1:22:27] all kind of animals no
[1:22:28] it was lamb
[1:22:32] all right and those are the only ones
[1:22:34] that goes in
[1:22:35] Lambs

[1:22:45] Lamb of a lamb of God do you understand
[1:22:47] what you're singing

[1:22:51] for the slaughter
[1:22:53] you're right

[1:23:17] God of your life
[1:23:19] y'all hear what I'm saying I know by the
[1:23:21] grace of God you need to understand

[1:23:25] bride and not suffer
[1:23:27] amen you gonna go through it
[1:23:30] but at the same time God is building
[1:23:33] character in you
[1:23:36] Hallelujah remember I said yesterday
[1:23:38] your attitude toward what God does in
[1:23:41] your life determines where you are
[1:23:43] whether you're still a baby or whether
[1:23:45] you're maturing
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] as a baby when your parents spank you
[1:23:51] you think they're being mean and it's
[1:23:53] not fair you hear that all the time that
[1:23:56] that's not fair
[1:23:58] and they don't understand as parents
[1:24:00] you're their judgment
[1:24:04] and his judgment his judgment God's
[1:24:06] judgment is true
[1:24:09] everything that goes on in your life has
[1:24:12] already been considered can I say it
[1:24:15] like that has already been been uh in
[1:24:17] God's mind
[1:24:19] he knows exactly the outcome
[1:24:22] and it's always for your betterment
[1:24:33] I said trust the Lord with all your
[1:24:36] heart and lean not to your own what
[1:24:39] understanding acknowledge Him in all
[1:24:42] your ways and he shall direct your path
[1:24:46] man
[1:24:50] yes Lord how can you ever say that the
[1:24:52] judgments of God is not true
[1:24:56] when he's the one who's kept you safe
[1:25:00] but he's the one who has that who's
[1:25:02] protected you
[1:25:05] in times of trouble he said what hide me
[1:25:13] and we don't we fail to see amen that
[1:25:15] the almighty God is working on a
[1:25:17] beautiful plan
[1:25:19] and you're part of it that's what I'm
[1:25:22] excited about
[1:25:23] Hallelujah I don't care amen where he's
[1:25:26] got me in the picture as long as I'm in
[1:25:29] the picture
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:33] Hallelujah
[1:25:34] each and every part is important that's
[1:25:38] why God put you together
[1:25:40] you understand me you could be in
[1:25:43] another church somewhere but God brought
[1:25:45] you here
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:48] and people say well you know people at
[1:25:50] the church
[1:25:51] they ain't this named that well the
[1:25:54] truth of the matter is you ate this and
[1:25:56] you ain't that
[1:25:57] right either
[1:26:00] God brought all this imperfection
[1:26:01] together
[1:26:03] to produce perfection
[1:26:07] but she get on my nerve that's why she
[1:26:09] was ordained to get on your nerve
[1:26:15] and guess what you got to love her
[1:26:19] Hallelujah
[1:26:22] is that right you don't have to love a
[1:26:25] person's ways but you must love them
[1:26:32] let me let me read a quote here I didn't
[1:26:34] do much reading yesterday but let me
[1:26:36] read this it's okay yes I'm gonna read
[1:26:38] it anyway
[1:26:44] oh did Steve
[1:26:47] that the revelation of this message
[1:26:50] is not always what we think laying on
[1:26:53] our hands and seeing the dead rays and
[1:26:55] eyes of the blind open even though those
[1:26:57] things happen
[1:26:58] we got to have a balance to all of this
[1:27:00] yeah
[1:27:01] right he said he never listen talking
[1:27:04] about Stephen now he never performed any
[1:27:07] miracles although he knew that Christ
[1:27:10] was a miracle performer you know I've
[1:27:13] heard people say well I ain't never seen
[1:27:14] a supernatural and I'm thinking
[1:27:17] you're something wrong
[1:27:19] something's really wrong because you're
[1:27:21] the supernatural
[1:27:22] when God saved you that was Supernatural
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:28] where were you looking when you were in
[1:27:30] the mirror
[1:27:32] hallelujah how can you forget what you
[1:27:35] used to be and what you are now
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:43] that was God who changed you
[1:27:47] that right he said and he knowed that
[1:27:51] Christ was a miracle performer he knowed
[1:27:53] all of his powers and things but what
[1:27:56] did he do he just this is this is the
[1:27:59] this is it he just presented his life
[1:28:03] in such a way that they seen that he was
[1:28:08] the power of Christ
[1:28:10] you understand me
[1:28:12] he it would seem like I tried to tell
[1:28:14] people the other day when God come
[1:28:16] looking for the token he ain't going to
[1:28:18] look in your heart
[1:28:21] he never went into rahab's house
[1:28:25] the token had to be displayed on the
[1:28:27] outside where everybody could see it
[1:28:31] that's right that's right wow y'all hear
[1:28:34] what I'm saying the token The Life of
[1:28:36] Christ has been praised in your heart
[1:28:39] but what good if it's just in your heart
[1:28:41] and it never manifests yourself on the
[1:28:44] outside
[1:28:46] the token Christ has been given to us
[1:28:50] for other people to see
[1:28:57] shed someone to heal Hallelujah you've
[1:29:00] got to be seen oh I don't want to be
[1:29:02] saying no we don't want to be seen but
[1:29:05] we want Christ to be seen
[1:29:08] Hallelujah
[1:29:10] that's demon right
[1:29:12] right amen you may never see a vision
[1:29:16] you may never put your hands on a sick
[1:29:19] person and feel the charge of the
[1:29:21] almighty God make a skeleton of a man
[1:29:23] turn back to life again
[1:29:28] that's the way it was in the Pentecostal
[1:29:30] realm we thought everybody with the Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost had lay hands on the sick raise
[1:29:33] the dead and oh you know what I'm saying
[1:29:36] now only God is speaking in tongues and
[1:29:38] shouting
[1:29:43] let me ask you a question
[1:29:45] but what do we have
[1:29:48] that's manifesting itself
[1:29:53] y'all hear what I'm saying oh I ain't
[1:29:56] talking about oh wow God's in the
[1:29:57] prophet I don't
[1:29:58] know no I'm talking about life
[1:30:01] The Life of Christ
[1:30:03] must be seen
[1:30:06] Hallelujah even if God never calls you
[1:30:10] to lay hands on the person you should
[1:30:12] know within yourself the ability
[1:30:13] everything that is necessary to do it is
[1:30:16] in me
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:19] amen amen is that the truth yeah I think
[1:30:22] about Jesus he could have killed he
[1:30:24] could have healed everybody but God Led
[1:30:27] Led him to the pool of shalom
[1:30:30] that's right Hallelujah that man like
[1:30:32] the prophet God wasn't the only man that
[1:30:34] needed healing and he was not the worst
[1:30:37] sick person there
[1:30:39] but God chose him
[1:30:42] yeah you see what I'm saying he was so
[1:30:44] in tune with the Holy Spirit
[1:30:47] take the leadership of God was just a
[1:30:49] nod

[1:30:52] somebody help me here
[1:30:55] comes by way of consecration

[1:31:47] message y'all remember how it used to be
[1:31:52] Miracles wasn't a problem
[1:31:54] it happened all the time healings and
[1:31:57] deliverances were all the time well then
[1:32:00] what has happened
[1:32:03] yes sir the word hasn't changed right
[1:32:08] people have
[1:32:11] even as the as the the early church
[1:32:14] Ephesus you know what happened to them
[1:32:16] they lost
[1:32:18] their first love
[1:32:20] we used to love the anointing
[1:32:23] we loved it in the church we loved it at
[1:32:26] school we loved it on the job we loved
[1:32:30] it every wherever we were not ashamed

[1:32:40] where you can see amen that what worked
[1:32:42] yesterday won't work today
[1:32:45] and this is cleaning up time this is
[1:32:47] time where God says make yourself ready
[1:32:51] and right now the devil got us all so
[1:32:53] busy right so preoccupied with
[1:32:56] everything and we're forgetting the most
[1:32:58] important thing and that is our souls
[1:33:03] oh you look at look at the people the
[1:33:05] the wealth is falling apart and
[1:33:07] everybody still want to be rich
[1:33:10] foreign
[1:33:12] what good if you gain the whole world
[1:33:16] and lose your soul
[1:33:18] can you imagine
[1:33:21] praise the Lord and the worst tormented
[1:33:24] people in hell is those who have heard
[1:33:27] this message and turned it down
[1:33:34] right because let me tell you something
[1:33:35] about death
[1:33:36] it will always bring you truth
[1:33:44] you can lie to yourself all you want in
[1:33:46] this dimension but when death comes
[1:33:49] death brings truth
[1:33:53] do you hear what I'm saying it brings
[1:33:55] you truth
[1:33:58] that's one time the devil is going to
[1:34:00] tell you the truth
[1:34:03] but if you
[1:34:08] do your bad side you'll believe him but
[1:34:11] oh if you've had an experience and you
[1:34:15] know where you're standing Hallelujah
[1:34:17] and you know that your ain't gonna hold
[1:34:20] and grips a solid rock not even death
[1:34:24] that's what Paul said who shall separate
[1:34:27] me from the love of God
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:31] Hallelujah
[1:34:33] I'm trying to preach I'm trying to get
[1:34:35] to my message here
[1:34:37] he said you'll never see you may never
[1:34:39] see a vision you may never put your
[1:34:41] hands on a sick person and feel the
[1:34:43] charge of almighty God make a skeleton
[1:34:45] of a man turn back to life again you may
[1:34:48] never see him standing Yonder in three
[1:34:51] uh or four rainbows you may never see
[1:34:54] his image you may never hear his voice
[1:34:57] but still
[1:34:59] you can be a signpost
[1:35:01] that will reflect Jesus Christ
[1:35:04] by a life that's been so pure and
[1:35:08] unadulterated upon the world from the
[1:35:10] world not smothered up with dirty things
[1:35:14] around your life but a pure unclear
[1:35:17] words that it'll cause the Hungry Heart
[1:35:20] to hunger and thirst to be like you
[1:35:26] I know that's real
[1:35:28] I had a young man as a friend still and
[1:35:31] he and you know I didn't know I was just
[1:35:32] living life
[1:35:35] and he said I just want to learn how to
[1:35:37] love God the way I see you love God
[1:35:41] to tell him I love God
[1:35:46] but he saw my life
[1:35:50] and that's what people need to see
[1:35:54] you know if Christians know that you if
[1:35:57] the sinner know that you're a real
[1:35:58] Christian they would take up for you
[1:36:02] people want to see somebody genuine
[1:36:05] something real
[1:36:08] and they will take up for you even when
[1:36:12] they themselves are not Christians
[1:36:18] Hallelujah and they know who to come to
[1:36:22] when when they need prayer
[1:36:27] that's how real it must be
[1:36:29] Hallelujah
[1:36:32] glory to God he loved the Lord
[1:36:34] amen listen listen
[1:36:38] brother Adam
[1:36:41] talked about
[1:36:43] uh
[1:36:44] the vision or the the visitation when he
[1:36:47] was on the high Ohio River
[1:36:51] and you know it's it's so amazing
[1:36:53] because
[1:36:56] am I coming through this message people
[1:36:59] had a way of interpreting things the way
[1:37:02] they wanted it to interpret it and so
[1:37:05] what they did is it's that they changed
[1:37:08] the gospel
[1:37:10] don't get mad with me now
[1:37:12] they changed the gospel from Jesus
[1:37:15] Christ
[1:37:16] to God sent a prophet
[1:37:19] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:37:21] and when they did that they lost the
[1:37:24] power
[1:37:25] of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:27] because the Holy Ghost only comes in the
[1:37:29] name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:31] somebody help me here they're still
[1:37:34] people
[1:37:35] and perhaps there was a time a man
[1:37:38] thought that
[1:37:40] but listen the message is moving
[1:37:43] it's moving on can I say it like this
[1:37:47] amen it's like you're being trained
[1:37:51] and if any of you have ever been in the
[1:37:53] military you know what I'm talking about
[1:37:56] and when you're in the military it ain't
[1:37:58] your way
[1:38:00] that's right it's the Sergeant's way
[1:38:03] and you better shut up and say nothing
[1:38:06] whatever he tells you to do you better
[1:38:08] do it
[1:38:09] because if you fail to do what you
[1:38:11] commanded to do guess what your whole
[1:38:14] platoon
[1:38:15] is going to have to suffer for you
[1:38:19] that's right and you don't want that to
[1:38:21] happen
[1:38:22] because they get mad with you
[1:38:24] you understand what I'm saying let me
[1:38:26] say it like this in in plain English
[1:38:27] when you don't do what God wants you to
[1:38:30] do your church suffer for it
[1:38:40] it's such a spiritual way that I don't
[1:38:42] think people realize
[1:38:44] how many times you thought about calling
[1:38:46] somebody and they called you
[1:38:48] the moment you was thinking about it
[1:38:51] huh
[1:38:53] why are you in a spiritual Realm
[1:38:56] somebody God said pray for you don't
[1:38:59] even know what that what's going on and
[1:39:00] all of a sudden you start praying for
[1:39:01] them then you call and they say well you
[1:39:03] know I needed something at that time and
[1:39:06] y'all know what I'm saying it is this is
[1:39:09] a spiritual thing
[1:39:10] but let me tell you like this
[1:39:13] if the ether wave if that if we we could
[1:39:16] create a crystal that could literally
[1:39:19] take the other dimension of the fourth
[1:39:21] dimension and and Fifth and whatever and
[1:39:24] bring it into this Dimension man's
[1:39:27] creation was able to do that tap into
[1:39:30] those other dimensions and bring them
[1:39:32] visible
[1:39:34] that's what William Branham was made out
[1:39:36] of
[1:39:37] and that's what you're made out of
[1:39:40] but if you don't put the crystal in the
[1:39:43] proper place
[1:39:44] you won't get it to work that's right
[1:39:46] you understand what I mean you are that
[1:39:50] connection to heaven
[1:39:52] and if you get in your proper place God
[1:39:56] will then send things through you that
[1:39:59] others may see that he is the same
[1:40:01] yesterday today and forever he changes
[1:40:04] not now I don't know maybe I'm wrong but
[1:40:08] the Bible said in the presence of the
[1:40:10] Lord there is fullness of joy
[1:40:13] Hallelujah and at his right hand there's
[1:40:17] Pleasures forever more and I go to
[1:40:19] church and I said but where is the joy
[1:40:22] yeah
[1:40:24] yeah
[1:40:25] where is the joy
[1:40:27] people to come to church they ain't
[1:40:29] happy
[1:40:30] they systematically come
[1:40:34] y'all don't understand I I was raised up
[1:40:37] in a church uh City that had a Catholic
[1:40:40] big Catholic Church six o'clock AM the
[1:40:42] past the the the the apocalypse is full
[1:40:46] and I I just every time I would see that
[1:40:48] I would rebuked I said you know this is
[1:40:50] a rebuke to the truth
[1:40:55] oh come on
[1:40:57] yeah I understand what I mean
[1:40:58] traditionally they they they there they
[1:41:01] believe if they come to the six o'clock
[1:41:03] mass I know I used to go to six o'clock
[1:41:05] mass
[1:41:07] six o'clock
[1:41:08] that early in the morning yeah
[1:41:15] Hallelujah you understand me we can't
[1:41:18] even get people to church on time at
[1:41:20] seven o'clock in the evening
[1:41:22] but those people will be there
[1:41:25] six o'clock in the morning just for a
[1:41:28] little space of time to get up on the or
[1:41:31] offer their knees back on their knees uh
[1:41:33] you know yeah
[1:41:35] and I always tell people they got more
[1:41:37] movement in their Church than message
[1:41:38] churches
[1:41:41] some people come into church and they
[1:41:43] sit down don't move until the church is
[1:41:44] over
[1:41:47] it's the truth
[1:41:48] let me go home
[1:41:51] but people I'm I'm trying to bring us
[1:41:53] into a place of life
[1:42:00] how many of y'all believe that brother
[1:42:02] Brandon said that the man in the message
[1:42:03] is won
[1:42:06] now he ain't talking about the flesh
[1:42:11] y'all believe that
[1:42:12] so let me ask you a question do you
[1:42:14] believe you're the message
[1:42:20] if I read your life what will I read
[1:42:25] hello
[1:42:28] come on somebody
[1:42:30] because a message had been given to you
[1:42:33] and and the angel said John eat the book
[1:42:36] eat it for thou must prophesy again
[1:42:41] yes sir
[1:42:45] we don't want to be found naked do we
[1:42:50] we want to be clothed upon
[1:42:53] this is a serious message this is
[1:42:54] serious you know I'm scared I'm afraid
[1:42:57] for most people I'm not saying I'm where
[1:43:00] I'm supposed to be but at least I know
[1:43:02] which which direction I'm headed
[1:43:05] and I look at people and I think where
[1:43:07] is the joy y'all remember some of us are
[1:43:10] old enough to remember
[1:43:12] people used to rush to church
[1:43:14] be on time
[1:43:16] but when it becomes a system where
[1:43:18] brother Brandon said I got to be here at
[1:43:20] a certain time you ain't got it
[1:43:25] you're not under a system
[1:43:28] but I'm rushing to get the charge
[1:43:30] because I know I'm going to meet him
[1:43:32] there
[1:43:33] God will meet me there
[1:43:35] [Applause]
[1:43:36] that's right and guess what Jesus keeps
[1:43:38] all of his appointments
[1:43:41] he's gonna meet me there that's why I
[1:43:43] want to be there how many of y'all know
[1:43:46] what I'm talking about when you
[1:43:48] establish a prayer life at a certain
[1:43:49] time in a day
[1:43:52] guess what
[1:43:54] sometimes you get there and he's already
[1:43:56] in your corner somebody know what I'm
[1:43:58] talking about the anointing is already
[1:44:01] there and you just kneel down weep and
[1:44:04] have a good time in God
[1:44:06] because you know Jesus beats you there
[1:44:14] I had a figment of our imagination it's
[1:44:17] real
[1:44:19] and the dimensions we're talking about
[1:44:21] is red down and when you're born of the
[1:44:24] sixth Dimension when God comes into you
[1:44:27] you pull from that Dimension that's what
[1:44:30] the
[1:44:33] place is in Christ Jesus
[1:44:36] not tomorrow now
[1:44:41] Hallelujah
[1:44:43] I haven't had joy in a long time it
[1:44:46] ain't God's fault
[1:44:48] Hallelujah
[1:44:53] one thing I love about my grandkids
[1:44:56] when they want something
[1:44:58] they don't mind asking
[1:45:00] and sometimes they have to huddle up
[1:45:02] team up
[1:45:04] and get a leader
[1:45:06] to come and ask me
[1:45:08] because they know if I say yeah that
[1:45:11] means all of them gonna get it
[1:45:13] right I've watched them
[1:45:15] just the other day my Danielle and and
[1:45:18] Judah and um
[1:45:20] and Israel got together they they I had
[1:45:23] some um
[1:45:24] some um chocolate chip cookies
[1:45:28] you know you you win the heart of a
[1:45:30] child when you're late at your cook is
[1:45:31] out there
[1:45:32] from the sea they know not to touch it
[1:45:36] but they know they can get it you
[1:45:38] understand what I mean and that's where
[1:45:40] God he laid everything out but he won't
[1:45:42] give it to you
[1:45:44] because you won't ask for it
[1:45:49] that's what this message is done
[1:45:51] it's done it's laid out all the goodies
[1:45:54] all the good things all the great things
[1:45:56] of God but we sit back there with I
[1:45:59] ain't worthy and you know maybe you know
[1:46:02] Grandpa may not give it to me well
[1:46:04] you'll never know
[1:46:06] yeah
[1:46:07] if you don't ask
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:11] you say I need patience God give me
[1:46:14] patience you need love suffering God
[1:46:16] giving you know I can't ask for that
[1:46:18] because that means I'm going to suffer
[1:46:19] yes
[1:46:21] but give it to me anyhow
[1:46:24] I'd rather have something that's going
[1:46:26] to stand the stone than something that's
[1:46:29] going to sink on the pressure
[1:46:32] that's right
[1:46:36] now I I haven't even hardly touched
[1:46:38] these notes of mine but my point is this
[1:46:40] I'm trying to get us to a place that you
[1:46:42] understand that the Capstone Ministry is
[1:46:44] here
[1:46:46] it ain't in heaven no more it's here
[1:46:49] it's come down God is here and you got
[1:46:54] to understand if he's here he's
[1:46:56] ministering
[1:46:57] right like the second let's say like the
[1:47:00] coming of the Lord
[1:47:02] let's just use in tight
[1:47:04] when God promised Abraham
[1:47:06] that they were going to have a son right
[1:47:08] yeah he did it right that's right and he
[1:47:12] told Sarah you're going to have a child
[1:47:14] right
[1:47:16] but when God came again he never did
[1:47:18] visit Abraham
[1:47:20] he visited Sarah
[1:47:25] she was the one that got pregnant yeah
[1:47:29] and it was such a mystery God never told
[1:47:31] us when he did it
[1:47:36] you hear what I'm saying what we don't
[1:47:39] understand amen that when when when God
[1:47:42] come and I have to say like this because
[1:47:44] you know we get this doctor what's the
[1:47:46] difference between the coming and the
[1:47:47] appearance
[1:47:48] either way he's him yeah
[1:47:52] I get so sick and tired of these these
[1:47:56] these folks
[1:47:58] just making
[1:48:00] making any differences
[1:48:02] to be able to separate themselves
[1:48:05] what the Bible said according to Jude
[1:48:07] those who call separation is not even
[1:48:09] they don't even have the Holy Ghost
[1:48:13] that you could take that to the bank
[1:48:15] we're living in a time of unity
[1:48:19] Hallelujah and it doesn't mean that your
[1:48:22] church drawn up with mine the Bible said
[1:48:24] by one Spirit are we baptized into one's
[1:48:28] body that is the unity that God is
[1:48:30] speaking of
[1:48:31] is right yes Hallelujah so what happens
[1:48:36] it was a mystery the same woman that
[1:48:39] doubted the same woman that laughed up
[1:48:43] her sleeve was the same woman that got
[1:48:45] the visitation from the angels
[1:48:49] and where was Abraham right
[1:48:51] right somebody help me here
[1:48:53] Hallelujah
[1:48:55] he's saying there are times that God
[1:48:58] about past a man
[1:49:01] and go to the woman
[1:49:04] Mr true he did it to Joseph
[1:49:10] he did it by way of Samson
[1:49:14] you see what I'm saying so what are you
[1:49:16] saying so
[1:49:18] oh in this day
[1:49:21] you got to understand where you're
[1:49:22] standing yeah
[1:49:25] because you can't turn to William
[1:49:26] Branham now
[1:49:28] then who do you turn to
[1:49:31] Christ
[1:49:34] him
[1:49:35] yes are y'all understanding what I'm
[1:49:37] saying
[1:49:38] who is your head ship
[1:49:41] Christ
[1:49:42] who is your house
[1:49:46] did you hear me say the word it is the
[1:49:48] word but it's the Living Word
[1:49:54] hallelujah how are you there's so many
[1:49:56] people who have haven't felt the
[1:49:57] anointing in such a long time you don't
[1:49:59] even know what it is
[1:50:04] let's move on you love the Lord

[1:50:09] things all the religion things you want
[1:50:11] to do you can you know you restore all
[1:50:13] your good to defeat the poor and though
[1:50:15] I give my body to be burned and people
[1:50:17] don't mind sacrificing and have not
[1:50:19] charity it profits me nothing
[1:50:22] you know what charity is the Divine love
[1:50:23] of God
[1:50:25] he didn't say though you know the faith
[1:50:27] won't he didn't say patience he said
[1:50:30] charity he came all the way up to this
[1:50:33] day
[1:50:35] put you in the worst age ever yeah
[1:50:39] yeah when hatred is everywhere wars and
[1:50:42] rumors of War people just can't stand
[1:50:45] each other
[1:50:46] somebody might look at me and say well I
[1:50:48] don't like him because I don't like his
[1:50:49] nose
[1:50:52] that's how stupid Lord forgive me but
[1:50:55] that's
[1:50:56] that's how bad people have gotten
[1:51:00] that was so quick to judge one another
[1:51:03] [Music]

[1:51:10] we better be thankful and say God I pray
[1:51:13] that I make it

[1:51:36] I'm trying to get us to see
[1:51:38] this thing that we're doing
[1:51:40] it's called religion

[1:51:59] the inside house
[1:52:01] Hallelujah come on somebody I mean can
[1:52:05] any of you the Bible says listen Your
[1:52:07] Righteous must exceed the righteousness
[1:52:10] of what the Pharisees the Pharisees had
[1:52:13] it they had the law
[1:52:16] and they hid behind it they were dirty
[1:52:19] just like everybody else
[1:52:22] that's what every time every time I I I
[1:52:24] I I see Mary coming into Simon's house
[1:52:27] and Simon Says Mary
[1:52:30] I'll always draw the question how did
[1:52:32] Simon know Mary
[1:52:36] let your mind walk a little bit
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:39] and he didn't try to stop her either
[1:52:43] so that you know all those kind of women
[1:52:45] have a black book
[1:52:54] he didn't stop her he murmured and said
[1:52:57] all that he was going to say but he
[1:52:59] didn't say it to her
[1:53:03] are you sure
[1:53:05] you see what I'm saying you see all
[1:53:08] those people all they did this is what
[1:53:10] Jesus said oh he said listen if I had
[1:53:12] not come you would have had a cloak in
[1:53:15] the last if I had not come your
[1:53:17] religions would have kept you hidden
[1:53:19] that's what about this message I love
[1:53:22] your religion won't keep you hidden
[1:53:25] the word is the sword of God it'll find
[1:53:28] you
[1:53:31] Hallelujah it doesn't matter how
[1:53:34] righteous and holy you look to one
[1:53:36] another the word of God comes to find
[1:53:38] you out
[1:53:41] Hallelujah Listen People of God I'm not
[1:53:45] interested in hiding from God
[1:53:49] and anytime you find yourself hiding sin
[1:53:52] is in the camp
[1:53:54] Hallelujah is that the truth when Adam
[1:53:57] and Eve sinned they hear from God
[1:54:00] but God Amen loved them so much he went
[1:54:03] after them that's what the word is doing
[1:54:06] right now is going after you to awaken
[1:54:12] you to the message of the hour
[1:54:14] I'm looking for a translation
[1:54:19] we hear the property God said there's
[1:54:20] nothing left but the translation the
[1:54:22] rapture
[1:54:23] that's what he said
[1:54:25] and how we think we're going to make it
[1:54:27] let me read this he said a few days ago
[1:54:29] when I was come out now
[1:54:32] because it's important this is the quote
[1:54:34] I wanted to find he said a few days ago
[1:54:36] when I come out of the most prettiest
[1:54:38] and most gorgeous place I ever saw in
[1:54:41] all my life I was the great it was the
[1:54:44] great building of our brother or Roberts
[1:54:46] and when I seen that solid marble and
[1:54:49] not a window in it nowhere but how it
[1:54:52] was fixed and I've been in Hollywood and
[1:54:55] I've been in King's palaces and I've
[1:54:57] been in everywhere that would be hardly
[1:54:59] around the world and all the swankies
[1:55:02] and lovely places and homes but I've
[1:55:05] never seen anything any place to compare
[1:55:07] with it nowhere at all how that little
[1:55:11] aluminum wire weaved and inside together
[1:55:14] and oh I had never seen anything amen so
[1:55:18] gorgeous in all my life when I walked
[1:55:22] through there and took my hand and I'm
[1:55:24] gonna tell you something here was a man
[1:55:27] with the greatest Ministry of them all
[1:55:31] that's right but in natural things he
[1:55:34] had the least of all
[1:55:38] and in The Invisible things he had the
[1:55:41] greatest of all
[1:55:42] [Music]
[1:55:45] because when he went behind the curtain
[1:55:47] he found a number
[1:55:50] that couldn't even be numbered
[1:55:53] and he said are all these branhams and
[1:55:56] the angel said no
[1:55:58] but they're your Converse
[1:56:01] he may have looked like a failure on
[1:56:03] this side but in heaven he's honored
[1:56:08] Hallelujah we don't want the world to
[1:56:11] honor us
[1:56:13] want the world to honor him and though
[1:56:16] we may go down looking like a failure we
[1:56:19] come up as winners Hallelujah
[1:56:22] glory to God
[1:56:24] call me what you want to
[1:56:27] I was telling our brother Ariel this
[1:56:30] morning I think it was this morning when
[1:56:31] God no man taught me uh who uh Malachi 4
[1:56:35] was
[1:56:37] you know some of y'all was taught I
[1:56:39] wasn't
[1:56:40] when I heard there was supposed to be a
[1:56:42] prophet I saw God
[1:56:45] and God revealed to me now I had heard
[1:56:48] of William Branham but God revealed to
[1:56:50] me that's who he was
[1:56:51] you understand me no man didn't teach me
[1:56:54] that so no man can take it from me
[1:57:00] people can do whatever they want to
[1:57:01] y'all y'all hear what I'm saying how
[1:57:04] many people in Jesus day it was revealed
[1:57:06] to him he was the Messiah
[1:57:10] Hallelujah with all of the Miracles he
[1:57:12] did you think all of Israel would have
[1:57:15] followed him but no sir and he was the
[1:57:18] one that was supposed to be with him
[1:57:19] fled when the persecution came but there
[1:57:23] was only one who stood by him and that
[1:57:25] was the Bride of Jesus Christ by the
[1:57:28] name of John Hallelujah the bride will
[1:57:31] never forsake Him the god bride will
[1:57:34] never run under fear
[1:57:37] she'll stand right there
[1:57:39] that's right
[1:57:41] she attempts she's time tested
[1:57:45] Hallelujah
[1:57:47] you're the only one of all the
[1:57:49] generations that has literally you don't
[1:57:53] see it but I'm gonna say it anyhow he is
[1:57:55] literally translated to you
[1:58:00] when the prophet of God
[1:58:02] came and he broke that Vision about the
[1:58:04] Millions
[1:58:05] the number no man can
[1:58:07] how many of you

[2:05:09] but I had such a respected relationship
[2:05:12] with him you understand me
[2:05:16] now this has nothing to do with my

[2:07:21] make mistakes
[2:07:24] huh
[2:07:25] oh I'm the bride you gonna make mistakes
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:32] the only one man that doesn't make
[2:07:34] mistakes is the man on the inside
[2:07:39] and who's going to judge which sin is
[2:07:41] greater than the other
[2:07:42] Jesus had that situation settled didn't
[2:07:44] he yeah
[2:07:46] yeah and he asked those group of people
[2:07:47] that accused that woman and said let him
[2:07:49] without sin cast the first stone he
[2:07:52] didn't even say let him that never did
[2:07:54] this act cast the verse on he said let
[2:07:56] him who is without sin
[2:07:59] he covered all yeah yeah oh yeah
[2:08:03] yeah oh
[2:08:08] I asked you today
[2:08:10] if he or any of you without sin
[2:08:14] and the Bible said if you you say I've
[2:08:16] never seen if I don't I don't it's the
[2:08:18] Bible said you make it a human liar
[2:08:22] let's move on
[2:08:23] I know what brother Brown is I know what
[2:08:25] the word of God says that once you get
[2:08:27] the Holy Ghost and everything you you
[2:08:28] are Justified as though you've never
[2:08:30] sinned in the first place and I love
[2:08:31] that
[2:08:32] because that's the way I live my life
[2:08:34] I live my life with all my mistakes as
[2:08:38] though I've never sinned in the first
[2:08:39] place that's what gives me joy
[2:08:43] to know that he's already erased it
[2:08:47] oh somebody maybe I'm crazy but I like
[2:08:51] it this way Hallelujah yes I know some
[2:08:55] of y'all thinking about food don't even
[2:08:56] think about it
[2:09:02] it ain't deadly come on come on well
[2:09:05] maybe it's already maybe it is but
[2:09:08] but my point is people of God this is
[2:09:11] more this is more important
[2:09:15] than your food out there yeah
[2:09:18] yeah that's what that's the word Jesus
[2:09:20] said I have meat
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:23] that you know not of he was talking
[2:09:25] about the word it sustains me it keeps
[2:09:28] me going
[2:09:30] Hallelujah let me get to the end of this
[2:09:32] thing
[2:09:33] you love the Lord he said when I stood
[2:09:36] outside there we just couldn't hardly
[2:09:38] Catch My Breath from such Majesty that a
[2:09:41] poor boy born in a Dugout a Pentecostal
[2:09:44] could do and bring that into that great
[2:09:46] Mammoth building and I thought oh my God
[2:09:48] maybe I am not worthy then just did just
[2:09:52] then a little voice came down through
[2:09:55] those corridors and said but I am your
[2:09:59] portion
[2:10:00] you hear what I'm saying
[2:10:03] what was it he had done all of that work
[2:10:07] and you know I the Easter Easter uh
[2:10:12] travel so much now we don't need Super
[2:10:14] highways we don't have no idea what it
[2:10:16] used to be like
[2:10:18] and he would get tired and then he would
[2:10:21] call that tiredness the lust of the
[2:10:23] flesh
[2:10:25] he want to sleep
[2:10:27] and he's calling it The lust of the flag
[2:10:30] oh God I said God I'm I'm a real sinner
[2:10:35] you understand what I mean but the point
[2:10:38] is he knew he had a duty he had a
[2:10:41] position he had a place to be and he
[2:10:43] knew he had to be to that place and he
[2:10:45] saw every adversity everything that came
[2:10:48] against him uh to keep him from that
[2:10:51] place
[2:10:52] he saw it as the enemy
[2:10:56] and what we do we give up
[2:10:58] where it must not have been the Lord's
[2:11:00] will how are you going to know if you
[2:11:01] didn't even fight
[2:11:05] you just take it as a large will because
[2:11:07] it's a hindrance it's not necessarily
[2:11:11] you need to fight God if you don't want
[2:11:14] me to go here if you don't want me to do
[2:11:16] this show me
[2:11:18] oh sister said Amen brother Brooks a
[2:11:20] sister had a dream and she saw this bad
[2:11:22] thing happened to me but I feel like I
[2:11:24] need to go to this place but she said if
[2:11:26] uh if something's gonna go back I say
[2:11:28] sister let me tell you something
[2:11:30] did God tell you to go
[2:11:32] go
[2:11:34] don't care about no dream
[2:11:38] yeah
[2:11:40] yes
[2:11:41] did you know this those ministers that
[2:11:44] were supposed to come those Chicago
[2:11:46] preachers that were supposed to come and
[2:11:48] meet brother Branham for a baptism you
[2:11:51] know what they had somebody speaking
[2:11:53] tongues and interpreted and said it was
[2:11:55] wrong
[2:11:56] that what brother Branham said was wrong
[2:11:59] and 400 people 400 ministers listened to
[2:12:04] an interpretation which was false
[2:12:12] let me tell you something I know the
[2:12:15] voice of God
[2:12:18] that's the only reason why I'm in Iowa
[2:12:20] it was God who took me there it wasn't a
[2:12:24] man it wasn't money it wasn't popularity
[2:12:26] it wasn't anything like that it was a
[2:12:28] leadership of God
[2:12:29] and when you know when God tells you to
[2:12:32] do something you better do it and the
[2:12:34] thing is you think you're gonna have it
[2:12:36] a smooth ask Moses about it God said I'm
[2:12:39] going to take you're going to go and
[2:12:41] take these kids to these people to the
[2:12:42] promised land and guess what Pharaoh so
[2:12:44] it ain't gonna happen
[2:12:47] Pharaoh comes after them
[2:12:49] Hallelujah momentarily Moses forgot his
[2:12:52] Commission and he began to cry out
[2:12:55] let me tell you something that's when
[2:12:57] God works his best when things come upon
[2:13:01] you unexpectedly yes that's when God
[2:13:05] shows himself God
[2:13:09] is that right when God had those
[2:13:12] disciples amen going across the sea and
[2:13:15] all of a sudden the Storm come up
[2:13:17] unexpectedly but God had given them the
[2:13:21] authority to rebuke and to bring on
[2:13:24] everything under control but instead
[2:13:27] they Cried unto Jesus Lord carrot thou
[2:13:31] not wake up Karen thou not that I perish
[2:13:34] and Jesus got up there and said peace be
[2:13:36] still Hallelujah is that right he didn't
[2:13:40] wring his hand he didn't say oh my God
[2:13:42] what's going on it was controlled
[2:13:46] his faith never wavered he knew who he
[2:13:50] was and he understood his Commission
[2:13:54] somebody help me here and then they said
[2:13:57] what kind of man is this that even the
[2:14:01] wind in the CEO Bay brother Bradley said
[2:14:03] they had it wrong it wasn't a man that
[2:14:06] stopped the storm it was God that
[2:14:09] stopped the storm
[2:14:11] Hallelujah you need to give God his
[2:14:15] place in your life let him do through
[2:14:19] you walking through you what he's
[2:14:21] ordained to work through you
[2:14:24] unexpectedly
[2:14:26] things happens
[2:14:28] and we get all excited oh my God why be
[2:14:32] why not you right
[2:14:36] now huh we do it that he that Sarah
[2:14:39] Venetian woman brother when her baby
[2:14:42] died
[2:14:43] she would have my woman when her baby
[2:14:45] died right
[2:14:47] amen everybody around who is excited she
[2:14:51] didn't get excited she said I got one
[2:14:53] goal I don't tried everything and
[2:14:55] everything has failed find me let's get
[2:14:58] up into this prophet
[2:15:00] yeah that's right you understand me in
[2:15:02] other words she was typing out as God I
[2:15:04] know God is in him I know it ain't the
[2:15:06] man but I won't I want to go where he is
[2:15:09] y'all hear what I'm saying so what
[2:15:11] happens you said listen don't stop at no
[2:15:13] yield
[2:15:14] don't stop it no stop sign
[2:15:17] don't y'all do this now
[2:15:25] said I heard brother Brook said you
[2:15:27] could no no I'm just letting you see how
[2:15:30] desperation works
[2:15:32] right y'all understand me my wife and I
[2:15:35] this is a situation with my when my baby
[2:15:37] had a
[2:15:39] epilepsy
[2:15:41] and here the devil always would act up
[2:15:44] every time I go across Seas or somewhere
[2:15:46] out of town she would have a an attack
[2:15:49] but but one day he the devil I was there
[2:15:54] I felt an insult
[2:15:56] y'all look at me like I'm crazy I talked
[2:15:59] to that devil I said you got a nerve
[2:16:01] to come in my house
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:06] you got a nerve to come in mouth and do
[2:16:09] this to my child
[2:16:12] but my wife being a mother
[2:16:14] she don't remember this part we have a
[2:16:17] staircase
[2:16:18] I said Ruby give me the baby
[2:16:22] I'm running I
[2:16:24] running after her up the stairs I
[2:16:27] thought she'd giving the baby up the
[2:16:29] stairs she'd run back down
[2:16:34] my wife
[2:16:38] God knew what he was doing when he gave
[2:16:40] her me
[2:16:41] yeah yeah no no other woman could have
[2:16:43] put up with me
[2:16:45] I'll be honest with you I've been a real
[2:16:47] case
[2:16:51] some men won't acknowledge that but it's
[2:16:53] true
[2:16:55] yeah raising eight kids and and a ninth
[2:16:58] one me
[2:17:06] don't remember but that just shows you
[2:17:08] what desperation does
[2:17:10] when desperation you lose it something
[2:17:12] moves in a certain way but anyway to
[2:17:15] make a long story short God revealed to
[2:17:17] her what we should do
[2:17:20] and she want we we was to take those
[2:17:22] clothes and rip them off the baby and
[2:17:24] burn them
[2:17:25] we did it
[2:17:27] and my daughter never had another
[2:17:29] seizure
[2:17:39] and she's a smart girl maybe too smart
[2:17:42] but she's a smart girl right but my
[2:17:44] point is amen when you wait on God God
[2:17:48] will answer
[2:17:50] Hallelujah is that all right it happens
[2:17:53] throughout the scriptures they get
[2:17:55] excited oh Moses Moses we're not what
[2:17:58] we're going to do but not Jesus
[2:18:02] now my question my thing is this
[2:18:05] it comes through consecration yeah
[2:18:08] when Jesus is in control
[2:18:10] you're out of control
[2:18:12] and Jesus will never panic
[2:18:20] hmm
[2:18:21] he'll never panic
[2:18:24] you love the Lord
[2:18:26] Hallelujah now uh he said the Lord is my
[2:18:29] portion can I give it a few more minutes
[2:18:31] because what are we going to do
[2:18:33] afterwards
[2:18:36] right
[2:18:37] just like I tried to tell my people just
[2:18:39] just act like you're looking at a movie
[2:18:44] right you'll sit there three hours or so
[2:18:48] you know somebody
[2:18:49] and just think you're not gonna get up
[2:18:51] when the best part getting ready to come
[2:18:55] right
[2:18:57] yeah so let's let's just carry on like
[2:19:00] that so my but he goes on and says
[2:19:03] listen
[2:19:04] I'm your portion yeah
[2:19:08] this message is supposed to be your
[2:19:10] portion
[2:19:12] I'm not talking about the letter form
[2:19:14] there's so many people could Out quote
[2:19:15] me when it comes to this message
[2:19:17] but it must live
[2:19:21] it must live through you
[2:19:24] hear what I'm saying it live we well you
[2:19:27] know we can we can always look back
[2:19:28] systematically and say well brother
[2:19:30] Randall it ain't about him no more it's
[2:19:33] you
[2:19:34] oh y'all got quiet it shows that you've
[2:19:37] been brainwashed
[2:19:42] [Music]
[2:19:44] let me explain myself
[2:19:47] the message and Prophet we can never
[2:19:49] deny what he did
[2:19:53] but the truth of the matter is it's
[2:19:54] about you now
[2:19:57] he's done what he's supposed to do
[2:20:01] come on somebody on the wings of a snow
[2:20:04] white dove he said the message made it
[2:20:06] home yes
[2:20:09] you understand me
[2:20:10] and don't you think you're gonna make it
[2:20:12] to Heaven because you can know you know
[2:20:14] who the prophet of God is amen God Jesus
[2:20:17] himself told Nicodemus you must be born
[2:20:19] again
[2:20:21] y'all understand me
[2:20:23] so so you can understand what I'm trying
[2:20:25] to say
[2:20:26] Elisha
[2:20:28] would have never
[2:20:30] gotten the double portions
[2:20:34] until he saw Elijah Lee
[2:20:39] absolutely
[2:20:43] hello somebody
[2:20:48] what was it
[2:20:50] so Elijah leave that's what Elijah said
[2:20:53] if you see me go
[2:20:56] I give it to you
[2:20:58] and the double portion of the anointing
[2:21:01] fell only life's shot
[2:21:03] and he never said where is Elijah he
[2:21:08] knew where Elijah was but he said where
[2:21:10] is the god
[2:21:13] of Elijah that's what
[2:21:16] that's what we want
[2:21:18] we want Niger
[2:21:26] IA
[2:21:27] Hallelujah
[2:21:30] think about it
[2:21:32] think about the people that I'ma bring
[2:21:34] it to all they think about the people in
[2:21:36] the message or thought they were in the
[2:21:38] message and never knew Jesus
[2:21:40] never came to know Christ but they could
[2:21:43] outquote you
[2:21:45] they knew how to live legalistically
[2:21:49] Hallelujah
[2:21:50] you have to criticize you
[2:21:53] Hallelujah but that's not on their door
[2:21:56] when death knocks on your door he wants
[2:21:59] to see one thing and that's the token
[2:22:03] when I see the blood I'll pass over here
[2:22:06] not the knowledge of your head
[2:22:09] but God is flesh
[2:22:12] that's you and brother Bradley he went
[2:22:15] on to say to God who was a messiah was
[2:22:19] that Messiah is in you you become
[2:22:22] Messiah
[2:22:25] this ain't no feeling thing oh I feel
[2:22:28] like it no it's a reality when you know
[2:22:32] who's in the house somebody help me here
[2:22:35] the Bible said you are the temple of God
[2:22:39] you're the temple of God God is in you
[2:22:43] and we think he's a million miles away
[2:22:45] when he said he's in you
[2:22:49] walk and talk like he's in you
[2:22:52] you love the Lord
[2:22:54] Hallelujah like I said since 1965 how
[2:22:58] far have we moved
[2:23:00] I can tell you what we've done this
[2:23:02] split split split split split
[2:23:06] now who's behind that right
[2:23:09] don't worry
[2:23:11] God is still working a masterpiece
[2:23:14] Hallelujah don't you worry the pride is
[2:23:17] not defeated
[2:23:19] Hallelujah and every promise God will
[2:23:23] bring us back together not by buildings
[2:23:26] but by the feeling of the Holy Ghost by
[2:23:30] an adoption that he promised us just
[2:23:33] like I said to you yesterday my
[2:23:36] inheritance is the inheritance of his
[2:23:38] his kingship
[2:23:41] Hallelujah he called me a king he called
[2:23:45] me a priest oh come on somebody yes
[2:23:49] inheritance amen is his Mountain
[2:23:53] is that right the same Mountain the
[2:23:57] almighty God will be setting on we'll be
[2:24:00] setting off
[2:24:05] Hallelujah yes sir
[2:24:11] I'ma close
[2:24:13] but let me tell you something
[2:24:16] this is this is one of the quotes that
[2:24:18] has always stuck with me once I read it
[2:24:21] hallelujah it's coming from
[2:24:23] amen the message of Melchizedek
[2:24:26] 1955.
[2:24:28] but this is always stuck with me and I
[2:24:31] can't get over it because I don't like
[2:24:33] to be uh I don't like to have all this
[2:24:36] drama
[2:24:37] when something happens
[2:24:41] but anyway coming from the 39th
[2:24:44] paragraph he said if we approach this
[2:24:46] subject today real sensibly
[2:24:50] calmly
[2:24:51] never be excited
[2:24:54] faith never gets excited
[2:24:59] y'all believe that
[2:25:01] faith never gets excited
[2:25:05] faith never rushes itself
[2:25:08] Faith knows what it's talking about
[2:25:13] you've never seen a master excited about
[2:25:17] anything
[2:25:18] standing by the grave of a dead man he
[2:25:22] was just as calm as he was when he sat
[2:25:25] on the mount and looked over Jerusalem
[2:25:28] think about it when he went to Tabitha's
[2:25:30] house how they laughed at him
[2:25:32] made fun of him
[2:25:34] he never moved he didn't get angry
[2:25:40] he didn't start calling people names
[2:25:45] help us Jesus
[2:25:48] right
[2:25:53] I stand on the trouble
[2:25:57] hearing says
[2:25:58] standing on the trouble
[2:26:02] not the trouble squishing me down but
[2:26:05] I'm standing on it
[2:26:09] the trouble oh
[2:26:13] and the waves tossed about he was so
[2:26:16] completely arrested in God until it
[2:26:19] never he it never even paid any
[2:26:22] attention to it enough to wake up
[2:26:25] always undisturbed faith is
[2:26:33] now we find here that the reason that we
[2:26:36] can be undisturbed because it was given
[2:26:40] to Our Father Abraham to his children
[2:26:44] and God who gave the promise swore by an
[2:26:48] oath that he would confirm it and keep
[2:26:51] it and that he has done
[2:26:55] you understand me the reason why amen we
[2:26:58] get so excited and so upset at times is
[2:27:02] because we're not consecrated yes
[2:27:07] right but when you're consecrated in God
[2:27:09] nothing like Paul says moves me
[2:27:14] no matter what it was and I'm almost
[2:27:16] no matter what goes nothing moves me and
[2:27:19] if I don't have the faith that can be
[2:27:22] undisturbed I want it
[2:27:24] give me that that kind of a faith give
[2:27:27] me that kind of a life amen that when
[2:27:30] bad noobs come but won't disturb me
[2:27:33] but you see when bad news come and it
[2:27:36] don't disturb you then you disturb the
[2:27:37] bad news
[2:27:39] there we go
[2:27:43] Hallelujah my last quote one day there
[2:27:47] will come a judgment upon the Earth
[2:27:50] and the first thing you know you're
[2:27:52] going to find people here looking for
[2:27:54] the rapture
[2:27:55] yeah and they don't and they don't then
[2:27:59] and looking for a Rapture and they've
[2:28:02] done been gone a long time ago
[2:28:05] It'll be such a minority he said as it
[2:28:07] was in the days of Noah so shall it be
[2:28:09] in the coming of the son of man as it
[2:28:11] was in the days of lot we think this
[2:28:13] great big bunch of Cannon Father Here
[2:28:15] Atomic Ash is going it'll only be if
[2:28:19] it's not got the Life of Christ in it
[2:28:21] because God will raise it up that's
[2:28:23] right only if it has the life of Christ
[2:28:26] in it there'll be a Rapture you think
[2:28:29] two or three people here and one over
[2:28:32] there hearing somewhere else and
[2:28:34] somebody came up missing and thought
[2:28:36] they'd run away from home and they
[2:28:38] better be careful they might be gone
[2:28:40] looking for a Rapture and it's already
[2:28:43] passed now that isn't contrary to the
[2:28:46] word no it isn't he come like a thief in
[2:28:49] the night see they could be gone before
[2:28:52] you know it
[2:28:53] and see that's what I'm trying to get
[2:28:56] everybody to see
[2:28:57] we have come to a place where we have
[2:29:00] sometimes to lack of concern
[2:29:04] we just feel good we're going
[2:29:07] do you think those million people
[2:29:09] millions of people that died in the
[2:29:12] wilderness did you do you think they
[2:29:14] they died thinking they were saved
[2:29:16] sure they did
[2:29:19] we didn't even know it ourselves until
[2:29:21] Jesus said in every one of them was lost
[2:29:26] hmm
[2:29:28] and listen the Bible said all these
[2:29:30] things were given to us as an example
[2:29:32] I'm closing
[2:29:34] people I came to be a blessing I didn't
[2:29:37] come to preach the normal
[2:29:41] I didn't come to do that I came to
[2:29:43] preach what God would have me to preach
[2:29:44] that would help us
[2:29:46] I don't know about you I'm constantly
[2:29:48] needing help

[2:30:03] every time you come to church you say
[2:30:06] Lord let that preacher say something
[2:30:08] that's going to change me
[2:30:11] because this word came from out of the
[2:30:14] Shekinah Glory and the word that comes
[2:30:17] out as a kind of Glory is supposed to
[2:30:19] change you
