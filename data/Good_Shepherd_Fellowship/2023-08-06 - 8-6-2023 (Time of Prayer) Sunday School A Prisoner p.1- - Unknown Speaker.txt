========================================

[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you father I tell you in these last days when we see this quick and power upon us we even give quickly power to us to see the fishing we have seen the quickly power working Among Us like it was and upon them in the early age to sit bring back Foundation raise the Dead make the stick wet the other day I was telling someone's a little Donovan works yeah I guess you all know him I was up front hunt lady for those fellas a nice little guy to come to your Churchill he's a very good friend of mine and he just said they didn't want to buy I looked his ear turned all inside out and I said hi Donovan you're talking about a hand like a cancer Dr Thomas what's America year so don't know about them at six seven months I said why you say something about I said uh I didn't want to holler you brother man I said you know what it is that I have an idea and the name of the Lord Jesus and the year of the grace and mighty works that you have done before and now we stand with anticipation raises our faith and announces to believe that what has been asked for tonight will be granted but God knows each and every one of them all that they have requested and we pray for them especially Lord those who are so near death bring peace to their soul if it isn't already there r [Music] that we have a symbol knowing that wherever two or more assembled together you'll be with us yes and we ask you Lord forgive us your word tonight to speak to us Lord and warn our heartstrings that we would know how to discipline ourselves a time that lays ahead as we believe that we're nearing the coming of the Lord we thank thee for our people now beginning to find Faith dear to them and knowing what they mean [Music] to do something Lord we're waiting with anticipation in his life the days of old that the time is near when you're going to just raise up the windows of heaven and pour out the Lord that God has promised in this last day how we ask you Lord to be with all around the Nations as the day we heard so many around everywhere that's in need grant them their request Lord and we pray to see the great hand of God moving all over the world among those who are looking for this great thing forgive us of our sin chase the slide of thy spirit in our word that we might discipline ourselves to obedient servants [Music] in the will of God let us remember and try to think in our hearts watch the early Christians done what type of people would we meet when we met those who had personally been in contact with you how their faith is with the lift up with faith and joy how their lives must have been the Living Word of God just written Epistles read of all men as they walked in among people God granted once more may Our Lives be so submitted to thee that the holy spirit will live itself through us and speak to us Lord may we remember in our minds as we walk up on the street and rub arms at the world we're not supposed to be like those if we step aside and give them the place for in their rightful position here on Earth they'll take the back seat knowing that we are delegates from another world Amen we have a kingdom that's coming in the power of Jesus and our great king will soon arise and take over all the kings is in his domains and he shall Rule and reign with him here on Earth thousand years and be with him forever with this in mind Lord now we look forward to the answer of our prayer they look there are confession if we have did anything said anything or thought anything that was contrary to your great will that the blood of Jesus Christ cleans the leaves lead us Lord as the sister said tonight about she and her husband on the road to Chicago leads them Lord God to the place that you can use that they might be beings of life for others who are hoping to Darkness that knows not our lord Jesus right now we commit the service to you and listening for your word of Correction and we might know how to prepare for this great hour in Jesus name we ask that amen thank you brother I was a little bit unexpected of this I being here at home I felt like if I if I was really I had to go somewhere emergency I'd feel very bad be sitting at home and I'd come to prayer meeting and I kind of dropped in unexpected to myself even to my family and just got in and tougher at all and so I thought I'm going down to prayer meeting and she didn't even have time to get ready to come so she didn't know I was coming so I'm happy to hear the sister's testimony there the brother about that light up in South Carolina or North Carolina somewhere Greenville was it was just here today I'm baptized you today in the baptism service here today brother leave alien or other ministers there brother Parker Thomas they was um I remember of a of the time of sister being shattered that it was a great confirmation sister the uh the Holy Spirit sometimes will let us go ahead and test our faith to see what and test others facing when you're looking directly at something and see something and say it others look and don't see it they say it's not there see but it is there now there was no one to see that life that's hanging over Paul but it was there and no one's seen that Dove coming down out of heaven in that light in a form and hung over Jesus but John himself but it was asking and so then later when I was telling the people about this light being like a pillar of fire no one wanted to believe it but now the mechanical eye of the camera identified that yeah I promised the evil spirit is dark it's just like our lives were Shadows and we're if we're right we're if our lives cope with the light of the day we're walking in line it's just like you look out and say I see the sun in the daytime you you see the shadow of the sun it's a reflection of the sun isn't the sun itself but it proves that there is a sun amen it proves there is the Sun and now when I see uh like she's sitting out there using fans talking that means you're living but it's only a shadow of life because anything has got to have darkness is to make a Shadow see yeah because a shadow has possessed so much darkness and so much light to make a Shadow and it can't be all together dark you can't be all together life if it's dark it's real dark if it's like there's a little nothing to make a Shadow but if it's mixed with dark and light it makes a shadow so we are really Shadows of life now you're reflecting a life from somewhere amen if you are in Christians this being a shadow it only proves that there is a life where you can't die because this life has this in it see yes but it's a shadow because you're living moving creature with abilities to seize things move and talk and the five senses of the body but yet you know they're dying and there's so much trouble you know it can only be the it's a reflection see that there's life and death mixed together the physical has to die but if you are reflecting by your moral life the light of heaven then you're reflecting the eternal life amen then when you die you can not only go to that light because that's what you reflected if you are the Dark World you reflect that and you can do go the other way but to God see and we are in a reflection so we see that as sure as the Holy Spirit reflects life and Life Soul does death reflect darkness and here they both are um it is a week maybe by Sunday we are getting the small photograph blown up to a large size so it can be put on the billboard or your picture hangs out there on the billboard I've only noticed it or not and then uh about a week ago in in Jamaica where it was missionary we sent tapes all over the world and the Seven Seals has got back into uh way back into the inlands of Jamaica way in the interior it's very primitive back in there behind Blue Mountains and the ladies sometimes they have a tape recorder a gift for them a chance to like the old victrola crank it and then let it play like that and every few minutes somebody has to crank it this group had a little a battery a six volt battery or something there playing this tape recorder and it is all setting together about once here tonight listening to those seals I believe it was and while I was speaking they noticed coming in the rooms in the same Pillar of Fire settle down over the top of it and they went and got a camera and tucked a picture of it and just the same ones there it is hanging right there over now we're getting to blow it up so we can put on the billboard out there that you can see it you are so grateful for the grace of God that's been brought into us into his presence now we are grateful for many things huh I think I'm looking here and see if I can find some some notes or something something other than spoken or get some kind of a um I got some text wrote out in way back in here in a book same time we'll meet you at all give me something to stay home something uh we're under anticipation for our sin I have been speaking uh in the messages and Sunday kept here a long time on why Christ sounds to me speak to the people and go forward now Sunday is the healing service or the sickest that we pray for it now you get around to the sick and there's got to be some reason that the sick when we pray for him if they're not healed and I want to it's the largely for just a sharp sermon on Sunday morning so I'm going to have a healing service and pray for all the peoples and uh Billy Paul or someone will be here Sunday Morning by 8 o'clock when the church opens they give the people cards as they come in the door um or whenever they get in and now um then I want to how I believe the Lord has somehow give me a little insight on the reasons why uh there's some people are not healed and I I believe this lack of understanding and I I believe maybe we'll speak on that Sunday morning the Lord willing now Wednesday night prayer meeting is just a short meeting where we get together and pray as we have and Associate together sometimes I believe one of the great things that I find in this day is the lack of sincerity of what we believe yeah if God in the days of John Wesley would have done in that day what he has done today what would have done the days of Martin Luther are what more as what we see him doing both proven by the church by the spirit and by science and every move that it's it's in motion has to recognize and God's word here declaring it and telling it before it comes to pass amen and then moving upon is prophesying and showing the very things that he said that have come to pass perfectly it's exactly what he says and still we sit highly slow as if we wonder well wonder if that can mean me wonder if it could mean just the the church and whole uh what about being included in this I think Sunday morning I try to talk on some of those principles that my in life is a little now tonight I found something has turned to it therefore come down I thought what a brother never was I get down on you have to say get up and speak and sit down they better write down a couple of scriptures that's all uh I know he's he's such a lovely brother and we um we appreciate it before we pray over the words I want to recognize them a brother I can't even call his name at this time two of them they are here friends of mine uh the their ministers and evangelists in the field going out they heard these messages by Tate and they're out of different denominational churches two young fellows and the boys so what I'm so interested that he flew down Tucson just recently and closing out a meeting I believe I was in the businessman's breakfast and Young fella fine young fella come down and he's they're from Kansas and they come all the way here for me to marry him I appreciate that to think that people are even your prayers enough believe that God would hear an answer and young people starting out in life like this and when he got here for me to marry him yesterday to find out the state law of Indiana requires them even though it's their blood test the weight near the state three days before the human hair so they cannot be married until Friday morning if you'll just stand up and tell us who he is and his lovely little uh lady there and the next brother [Music] another large time here on the end and it's a decent amount of heroin Iowa so thank you very much we certainly wish these young ambassadors for the work of the Lord Jesus God's blessings to speed them on the way and as I wondering waiting for the coming of the Lord and see young man and young women with a purpose and heart to serve Christ that's real see them raise up like this the Lord bless you richly my brother sister now let us turn over to a little book that I never spoke out of before in my life and it's a very just one chapter the book of films and uh I'm just a little bit Irish and uh and I do have a wall around the bottom teeth to hold a couple in the back in place uh I sometimes I don't pronounce these names right when I do know what they are and sometimes I can't pronounce them right for the rise of Education so Freeman someone said back there which I think is really the correct pronunciation of it now the first verse I want to take just a word or two form it Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and that's what I want to use tonight as a text the Lord willing is a prison amen now you could hardly imagine Paul regarding himself a prison a Born Free Man filled with the Holy Spirit but yet he calls himself a prisoner and now we find out when he's addressing the Corinthians all an apostle of Jesus Christ another time Paul a servant of Jesus Christ by the will of God when he speaks into Timothy different ones now when he's writing here's a screaming he says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ Paul an apostle a prisoner but tonight being it takes hours to duly consider one of the subjects I'd like to take tonight's Paul the prisoner and take the subject of a prisoner now let us bow our heads just a moment God Jesus any man that's physically able can pull back the pages of this Bible but only the Holy Spirit can interpret it in the life that it's been meant to we asked him to come now and help us to understand what this was addressed this Great Mighty prophet oh and yet call himself a prisoner May the Holy Spirit reveal this to us as we wait on him in Jesus Christ's name amen now I can imagine uh of Paul when he wrote this letter the filming how he was uh setting in jail uh down there in the dungeons of this estate a prison and he can well know by his position what the word meant he was surrounded by by bars he could only be left free as someone was letting go free and he knew what it was to be a prisoner and then again I believe that the Apostle meant just a little not exactly addressing it to use prayers and conditions as being a prisoner of his his physical being set in here in this in this uh jail but I believe he was referring to his his being his his Spirit his will and being a prisoner to Jesus Christ now we're all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish you God justly does that because he must put every man on the same basis or he put the wrong man on he fought the first man on the wrong basis that he put on three more relationships they were just as fast as I get him in Eve there's no difference right around says before either one of us life and death we can make our choice amen it's up to you to make it see if that's the way Adam and Eve did and seeing and they made the wrong choice and now by that put the whole race of human race under death the penalty of death and then God came down in the form of man and took that death and paid the penalty of death that there is subjects that desire to be free could go free now if he took us without the same uh way that he did Adam Eve just pulled us through something said I said he really won't say it or not then he put Adam and Eve on on the wrong base but each one of us has to choose this day between death and life we can do it is our just Express if your life will prove you're alive or prove exactly what side you're on I don't care what side you say you're on watch you do every day cruise wants you off you've heard the old saying your life is so loud I can't hear your testimony see your your actions this allowed I've always pleased and shouting and jumping but I've always said don't jump no higher than you live because the world's going to watch that you see you must just uh jump as high as you live so because Somebody's Watching You and now when people won't come to church they many of them just won't do it and some of them not cunning is sincere people they see so much corruption in the church until they don't want to have anything to do with it and many times we are speaking on a flat thought of that you can hardly blame it see because of the way that people act they call themselves Christians they're the greatest stumbling block that the World Cup is the man and woman who professes to be a Christian and lives something different from their profession exactly right that's where the disappointments will be coming at the judge Now The Sinner The Bootlegger The Gambler the adulteress he won't be uh disappointed here his sentence read to depart into Everlasting fire he won't be disappointed but that fella who's trying to hide himself behind some kind of a church profession that's the boy that's going to be disappointed at the day of judgment see that profess us to be a Christian and live some other way you'd be better for him that he never did even make any kind of profession start at all then to start and live something different because he's the greatest dumb and all we got is for that professor that says that he he he is a Christian and lives something different always don't judge your life for how much power you have to perform miracles and we don't judge ourselves but how much knowledge you have of the word but always judge yourself look back and take an inventory of what kind of a fruit that the lies you presently live now is there see as I speak some time ago at a businessman's meeting and Phoenix Arizona of uh the reflection of Jesus a reflecting Christian Life but then I was born up here in Kentucky where it's very primitive especially back when I was a kid and this similar boy I never had a a home like we had here we had so many pretty ladies that have to look through Mayors all through the house to keep their hair just in place and so forth but he had one little mayor just a little piece tacked on a tree on the outside where the wash was where he's mother and father washed and they combed their hair and so forth in this little piece of an old man attacked on a tree frankly that's the type of a home that we have anybody wants to see a mayor we kids we had to get a box to get up on the wash bench and look at this piece of a of a narrative I picked up myself in a dump that wasn't down in Kentucky that you're in Indiana up on a Utica Pike here now this little kid has never exactly seen himself like that so he comes to the city to visit his grandma and throw a room the Grandma had a house that had a complete mare on the door and so we're about running through the room seen another little boy in finally the little boy was running also so he thought he should stop a few minutes to see what the little lab would go to do and when he stopped the little boy stop he turned he says a little boy turned his head scratched his head a little I scratched his finally walked closer to investigate and he turned around his mother watched him and his grandmother was amazing said well our mother that's me Dora said that we too are a reflecting something see our life is reflected and now if we live in the days of Noah whose side would we take what side were we talking at Great uh or a day that Noah lives what size were we talking the days of Moses what side in the Days of Elijah the prophet when all the world was golfed up in a a great a massive uh of modernism like the modern Jezebel and had read all the Servants of the Lord out into a whirly way in the church that priests is all abide to her would you accept the side of popularity or would you stupid Elijah now within the days of the Lord Jesus when we thank this unpopular person uneducated by the world those schools they could ever find that he went to and all those Seminary experience and and then raise up with the name of illegitimate birth and that kind of preaching a gospel that was contrary that anything that they had been taught very in condemning the ministers in their organizations and so forth and the organizations that made a a statement of anybody even went to hear the so-called prophets would be put out of the synagogue which was a model sin they had to be a tatted or really to worship us are the blood of the Lamb they had to come to this sacrifice and and then they were outcasts and what a great thing it was and this man ignored such as that and yet he was perfectly with the scripture but not in the way they knew it what size would you have took see now your life that you live now reflects now just what their name because you still are possessed with the same spirit amen if you take that side down with the amp you to Jonathan because the Same Spirit that's in you now within people man see the devil never takes the spirit it just goes off of one man on to another God never takes his spirit either it goes from one to the heavens so the very Spirit was upon Elijah come upon Elisha same one on John the Baptist and so forth the Holy Spirit was up on Christ come upon the disciples all that are still upon the people you see God's ever takes his spirit so there we are left to make a charge and I I can't see you were Paul was regretting uh anything and saying he was sorry he was a prisoner but he's addressing yourself I believe that Paul as he wrote this letter with us [Music] thank you
