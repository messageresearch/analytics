[1:07:52] blessing upon the service
[1:07:55] praise the Lord
[1:07:57] and
[1:07:59] uh
[1:08:01] I told Brother
[1:08:03] Jordan now the word
[1:08:06] around this
[1:08:10] I'm actually taking this inspiration
[1:08:12] from
[1:08:13] brother Brown message
[1:08:15] Paul a praising her
[1:08:19] that's that's what I'm taking the
[1:08:20] inspiration from
[1:08:22] and we will preach speak on a prisoner
[1:08:25] of love
[1:08:29] but then we will come back
[1:08:31] to uh
[1:08:34] that's after the book of Titus
[1:08:57] praise the Lord
[1:08:58] foreign
[1:09:02] preached his message on a Wednesday
[1:09:05] night
[1:09:06] it was a Wednesday night he preached his
[1:09:09] message and their very night
[1:09:11] he baptized the great scholar brother
[1:09:14] leeville in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ
[1:09:18] so

[1:09:51] this is a letter
[1:09:54] that was intended to be a private letter
[1:09:58] but it was also
[1:10:03] a benefit to

[1:10:41] instructed Lord father to say what the
[1:10:43] messengers say it is not just literally

[1:10:49] but being under the Same Spirit that's
[1:10:53] what he said in the church age book lord
[1:10:55] it will have to take the Holy Ghost to
[1:10:58] keep us under there same anointing for
[1:11:00] us to say what the messengers say now
[1:11:03] for us to be like a parrot Lord oh god

[1:12:31] want to make sure that everybody is
[1:12:33] covered
[1:12:34] praise the Lord
[1:12:38] while I was studying on this I saw this
[1:12:43] ad someone wrote this ad they said help
[1:12:46] wanted
[1:12:49] so after reading the essays yeah this is
[1:12:52] a good ad I think I can use it in church
[1:12:54] because
[1:12:56] I need help amen
[1:12:58] it's good when you can get to the place
[1:13:00] and realize that you need help
[1:13:03] so uh uh I told us as well I think it's
[1:13:07] a good thing I think I can use it
[1:13:10] so uh they said men and women want it
[1:13:14] for difficult tax of building a church
[1:13:21] men and women wanted for difficult tasks
[1:13:24] of building the church
[1:13:27] you will often be misunderstood
[1:13:31] even by those working with you
[1:13:37] you will face constant attack from an
[1:13:40] invisible enemy
[1:13:44] you may not see
[1:13:46] the result of your labor
[1:13:49] and your full reward will not come
[1:13:53] until after all your work is completed
[1:14:00] it may cost your home
[1:14:02] your family
[1:14:04] your ambition
[1:14:06] even your life
[1:14:11] who's all in this morning
[1:14:15] praise the Lord
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:19] I don't know whether you understand the
[1:14:21] term of the job you are signing up for
[1:14:25] praise the Lord
[1:14:27] amen
[1:14:31] praise the Lord
[1:14:34] but I I I was being studying this uh uh
[1:14:38] message for the wine
[1:14:41] and uh
[1:14:45] I took this portion that's supposed to
[1:14:47] be the end it's supposed to be the end
[1:14:50] brother Brown actually brought this out
[1:14:52] at the end
[1:14:53] and uh
[1:14:58] at the end he said
[1:15:00] oh
[1:15:04] finally
[1:15:06] God had a man
[1:15:10] that was subject to him
[1:15:13] highness to him and could not move until
[1:15:17] the word of God move him
[1:15:20] if people who do a people who just do
[1:15:24] that
[1:15:26] then he was his prisoner
[1:15:30] a prisoner of love
[1:15:34] yoke up in the bound of love with God
[1:15:38] as Paul was yoked up in the bound of
[1:15:41] Love With God just like Paul
[1:15:44] so that's what we're taking our
[1:15:46] inspiration from this morning
[1:15:49] a prisoner of love
[1:15:52] but uh
[1:15:55] might go in a completely different
[1:15:57] direction this morning
[1:15:59] as
[1:16:02] but we have we have a whole month
[1:16:05] or the rest of the year to be able to
[1:16:07] exhaust everything that was taught to
[1:16:09] you
[1:16:10] praise the Lord
[1:16:15] he says now
[1:16:17] I can imagine Paul
[1:16:21] when he wrote this letter
[1:16:24] Philemon how he was sitting in jail
[1:16:29] down there in the dungeon
[1:16:32] of this city in Praise I mean a prisoner
[1:16:37] and he
[1:16:39] could well know by his position
[1:16:43] what the word meant
[1:16:46] he was surrounded by bars
[1:16:49] he could only be let free as someone who
[1:16:53] let him go free
[1:16:56] and he knew what it was to be a prisoner
[1:17:02] and then again I believe the Apostle men
[1:17:05] just
[1:17:07] a little not exactly addressing it to
[1:17:11] his present condition
[1:17:13] as being a prisoner in his physical
[1:17:17] being sitting there sitting here in the
[1:17:20] jail in this jail but I believe he was
[1:17:23] referring to his being his Spirit his
[1:17:28] will
[1:17:29] being a prisoner
[1:17:31] to Jesus Christ
[1:17:34] praise the Lord
[1:17:38] so that's that's what we want to look at
[1:17:40] uh this morning
[1:17:43] that's what we want to we want to study
[1:17:45] this morning I have a little picture
[1:17:48] there that I that I took off and uh of
[1:17:53] Paul
[1:17:54] in in praising
[1:17:56] writing his letters
[1:18:04] this morning
[1:18:06] we all sit here
[1:18:08] well dressing coming to the house of the
[1:18:11] Lord
[1:18:12] to to Worship the Lord in and
[1:18:17] true
[1:18:19] bring praise sing Psalms and and praises
[1:18:22] to the Lord
[1:18:26] and yet that's that's you know that's
[1:18:29] wonderful
[1:18:30] there's uh
[1:18:34] but there are some that I gather you
[1:18:37] know in other places in hitting places
[1:18:40] they are worshiping and uh
[1:18:44] the the Christians in the in the in the
[1:18:49] Emirates the Arab Republic they can't
[1:18:51] gather on Sunday
[1:18:53] because it will be against the national
[1:18:56] law they have to gather on Friday
[1:18:59] because it's the Islamic worship day
[1:19:03] and so they don't have the privilege to
[1:19:06] meet even though some of them do meet
[1:19:09] but they have to do it in secret
[1:19:12] or as they could be arrested and
[1:19:14] persecuted for it
[1:19:17] and there are some that are having the
[1:19:20] Sunday service this morning in praising
[1:19:25] and whether you are in a suit
[1:19:27] like me
[1:19:30] oh
[1:19:31] in your best dress for Sunday today
[1:19:37] as we go into this I will want you to
[1:19:41] realize uh establish I want to establish
[1:19:45] the fact that
[1:19:46] God has designed it
[1:19:49] is God's Own design
[1:19:53] praise the Lord
[1:19:54] as much as we think we are in a free
[1:19:58] country you have your cars parking out
[1:20:00] there
[1:20:01] amen and you can get up anytime and join
[1:20:04] it and go and of course we wouldn't like
[1:20:08] you to do that right now and just bear
[1:20:10] with us a little bit
[1:20:12] amen but
[1:20:15] what I want us to realize is that
[1:20:19] there is there's a great design of God
[1:20:22] there is there is something
[1:20:26] the more you look into this you know as
[1:20:29] I was as I was
[1:20:31] setting last night actually it was this
[1:20:34] morning that the whole thought started
[1:20:36] breaking to me and I realized that
[1:20:39] I'm beginning to look at the subject
[1:20:41] completely different
[1:20:45] why let me ask this question
[1:20:48] because if you look in the in the Bible
[1:20:51] you realize that
[1:20:55] most of God's people Joseph had to go to
[1:20:59] praising
[1:21:02] praise the Lord
[1:21:04] even our lord Jesus have to go to
[1:21:06] praising
[1:21:10] you will find out because as I was
[1:21:14] thinking about it this morning I caught
[1:21:16] myself between the Rock and the high
[1:21:18] place
[1:21:20] because here we have a society we are
[1:21:24] living in a society that
[1:21:27] uh setting words and and approach to
[1:21:31] certain subject has been misunderstood
[1:21:35] praise the Lord
[1:21:37] but if you take this Bible
[1:21:40] this is the word of God
[1:21:42] we believe that this is the word of God
[1:21:44] this is the Breath of God this book is
[1:21:47] sacred
[1:21:48] if you take this Bible you'll realize
[1:21:51] that one of the big history in the
[1:21:55] scripture
[1:21:56] the very foundation of the church
[1:21:59] is surrounding the life of a people that
[1:22:03] were
[1:22:04] in praising that were people that were
[1:22:06] enslaved
[1:22:09] praise the Lord
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:15] yeah
[1:22:17] in our present word that we are living
[1:22:19] in there's a complete different context
[1:22:24] of slavery
[1:22:26] and I want to pray slavery to you this
[1:22:28] morning I don't I don't know much about
[1:22:30] it but
[1:22:33] I want for us to grab our mind because
[1:22:37] you have to realize what I want us to
[1:22:40] realize is that
[1:22:43] foreign
[1:22:44] everything that God allowed
[1:22:50] he has a fountain of Rich thoughts
[1:22:54] behind it
[1:22:58] sometimes we get stumble by the surface
[1:23:02] Jeremiah says and he says speaking God's
[1:23:06] thought I know the thought that I think
[1:23:08] towards you
[1:23:11] the another thoughts of evil
[1:23:14] praise the Lord
[1:23:16] amen they are not the thoughts of evil
[1:23:20] but Joseph being the young boy Joseph
[1:23:23] was just a teenager
[1:23:26] when he was sold to the Ishmael Knights
[1:23:29] and taking over to Egypt
[1:23:32] he miss all his youthfulness
[1:23:36] praise the Lord
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:39] Joseph there is no way that Joseph who
[1:23:44] has sat there
[1:23:45] being so to those men completely
[1:23:48] stranger
[1:23:49] he's in the chair taken away
[1:23:52] to a place where he don't know where
[1:23:55] there is no way that he could sit there
[1:23:58] and think that this was for good
[1:24:05] there is no way that Joseph could sit in
[1:24:07] that Terror he said he is for God
[1:24:12] I believe he cried
[1:24:16] because he won't see his little brother
[1:24:18] Benjamin
[1:24:21] he won't see his father that love him
[1:24:28] and he won't see his brother he cannot
[1:24:31] even tell why his brother would do this
[1:24:33] to him
[1:24:36] praise the Lord
[1:24:38] but for many years after
[1:24:41] they are very Saint Joseph who said you
[1:24:43] meant this for evil
[1:24:45] but God
[1:24:47] made
[1:24:54] praise the Lord
[1:24:57] man we thank God for the prophet
[1:25:00] that took us back to the mind of God
[1:25:05] praise the Lord
[1:25:06] if you are still stuck on the pages
[1:25:09] you are missing a whole lot
[1:25:12] go beyond the pages and let's go back to
[1:25:15] the mind of God
[1:25:17] brother Branham question and answer in
[1:25:19] Genesis he said let's stand on the
[1:25:20] bannister of Heaven
[1:25:22] and let's go back to the mind of God and
[1:25:24] see before there was a word
[1:25:27] when God was alone
[1:25:34] praise the Lord
[1:25:37] Hallelujah
[1:25:41] when brother Branham was starting this
[1:25:43] message he said
[1:25:45] Yeti now uh
[1:25:51] part of person that he says now could
[1:25:52] you highly imagine Paul regarding
[1:25:55] himself a prisoner
[1:25:57] and a Born Free Man filled with the Holy
[1:26:01] Ghost but yet he called himself a
[1:26:03] prisoner
[1:26:04] and now we find out
[1:26:08] when he addressed in the Corinthian he
[1:26:12] said Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:26:15] another time he said Paul as seven of
[1:26:19] Jesus Christ by the word of God Amen
[1:26:23] when he's speaking to Trinity different
[1:26:26] ones
[1:26:27] now when he's writing to Philemon he
[1:26:31] said Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:26:35] Paul an apostle and they like to to
[1:26:37] preach one night on that Paul at seven
[1:26:41] preach on that
[1:26:42] and then Paul a prisoner so I try to
[1:26:45] follow brother Branham I'll try to take
[1:26:47] each one and preach on it
[1:26:50] praise the Lord
[1:26:53] but he started starting from the
[1:26:54] beginning I want to start from the end
[1:26:57] because later on when he went down in
[1:27:00] the message then he tells us about a
[1:27:02] prisoner of love
[1:27:04] so I want to start from a prisoner of
[1:27:06] love
[1:27:07] and then we will go back to Paul and the
[1:27:11] Apostle Paul a seven
[1:27:15] and then Paul a prisoner
[1:27:18] so well you like it on that
[1:27:22] I want to create a good picture this
[1:27:24] morning
[1:27:25] so
[1:27:27] we will understand this thought
[1:27:34] we have a body
[1:27:37] we have this body
[1:27:40] but in this body we have millions of
[1:27:44] cells
[1:27:48] and
[1:27:51] our cells genes and different things
[1:27:54] that run down from our
[1:27:58] parents
[1:28:00] and different things is all bottled up
[1:28:03] in this body
[1:28:06] in this body you have Ambitions you have
[1:28:09] potentials you have thoughts and all of
[1:28:13] that
[1:28:14] but yet
[1:28:17] is
[1:28:18] all of those things
[1:28:21] I control
[1:28:24] now this young man goswell
[1:28:29] in him everything
[1:28:31] that you would need to be a father is
[1:28:34] already in him
[1:28:36] praise the Lord
[1:28:39] he has Ambitions he has you know
[1:28:42] everything
[1:28:45] there are some things from his father
[1:28:48] brother Dan and some things from his
[1:28:50] grandfather and great-grandfather they
[1:28:53] are all
[1:28:54] into their body
[1:28:58] so look at the concept where I want to
[1:29:01] drive to here is that this body itself
[1:29:04] is a prison
[1:29:08] there are a lot of things that are held
[1:29:10] Behind the Walls of this flesh you are
[1:29:13] looking at
[1:29:15] praise the Lord
[1:29:17] even the rear mean is Behind These Walls
[1:29:22] what you what you are looking at is just
[1:29:24] uh uh uh uh uh I'm trying to look for
[1:29:29] the right word where is the first
[1:29:31] picture the mug shot the first picture
[1:29:33] you take when you get to praising
[1:29:36] is that how they call it
[1:29:38] when you get a prison that the first
[1:29:40] picture you come
[1:29:44] and you take your mark shot
[1:29:46] that's your praising picture buddy
[1:29:49] praise the Lord so what you're looking
[1:29:52] at this is my mark shot
[1:29:54] but the real guide is Behind These Walls
[1:30:01] praise the Lord now think about it
[1:30:05] this morning
[1:30:08] that the almighty God the great infinite
[1:30:13] God
[1:30:16] The God That Failed all time in all
[1:30:19] space
[1:30:21] praise the Lord
[1:30:23] will choose
[1:30:26] to bring all his infinite wisdom
[1:30:30] in his infinite power
[1:30:35] and he says a body will thou prepare me
[1:30:41] praise the Lord
[1:30:43] what I'm doing now and I'm trying to
[1:30:45] build
[1:30:49] the concept of a prisoner
[1:30:55] God deciding to live
[1:30:58] eternity
[1:31:00] and begin and break into time and
[1:31:04] condense himself into time for him to
[1:31:07] step down into time
[1:31:09] he had to praising himself
[1:31:16] because living
[1:31:18] eternity to break into time he will no
[1:31:22] longer do things as an internal being he
[1:31:26] will now have to establish time and
[1:31:29] season
[1:31:30] just like a prisoner you you can't eat
[1:31:33] any time you want to eat
[1:31:36] you can go to the basketball court
[1:31:39] anytime you want to
[1:31:42] your daily routine is scheduled in a
[1:31:45] prison
[1:31:47] there's all sufficient God that fill all
[1:31:50] space and time
[1:31:53] will now step himself down
[1:31:58] into time
[1:32:01] to give himself a first day
[1:32:05] praise the Lord
[1:32:07] then he goes back into praising the
[1:32:10] second day he comes out and do something
[1:32:12] then he goes back into praising the
[1:32:15] third day he comes out and do something
[1:32:17] then he goes back into so God
[1:32:21] put himself in a state where now and he
[1:32:25] had to work by the Lord of time
[1:32:30] even while he was in the body
[1:32:34] a body of Flesh
[1:32:36] he stayed hard His Infinite Wisdom
[1:32:41] but yet there are things he could not
[1:32:43] say
[1:32:44] because it was not the time
[1:32:49] praise the Lord
[1:32:54] and you grabbing the concept
[1:33:00] so you look through the scripture you
[1:33:03] see over and over you think about it
[1:33:06] God promising Abraham
[1:33:09] that he will be the father of Nations
[1:33:13] was it difficult for God
[1:33:16] to deal with Abraham bless Isaac right
[1:33:19] in that place and let Isaac have his
[1:33:22] children and God who established and
[1:33:24] start his own holy nation right in the
[1:33:27] land of Cana why he had to carry the
[1:33:31] people into prison
[1:33:33] Joseph Glory into praising
[1:33:36] and by Joseph Brothers coming to meet
[1:33:39] him the entire Seed of Abraham will be
[1:33:42] enslaved why would God do that
[1:33:47] why would God do that
[1:33:51] what is it about praising that God
[1:33:55] allowed all his children to go to praise
[1:33:58] him
[1:34:02] praise the Lord
[1:34:05] somebody in the prison of their will
[1:34:09] some this morning is in the prison of
[1:34:11] your mind
[1:34:16] praise the Lord
[1:34:18] have you ever thought about it
[1:34:21] why is called cell phone
[1:34:27] if you just break the word and look at
[1:34:29] it it's a cell for one person
[1:34:36] amen as a cell pH will take the word for
[1:34:42] one sell for one
[1:34:44] you are locked out in it
[1:34:47] it controls your life
[1:34:52] praise the Lord
[1:34:53] if you call it if you have an alarm to
[1:34:56] wake you up
[1:35:00] and that person set an alarm for people
[1:35:03] to go to bed they have a lamb to eat
[1:35:06] a lamb to drink
[1:35:12] or you really never thought about it
[1:35:17] that's yourself
[1:35:19] you are locked in it
[1:35:21] the day you go if I it looks like what's
[1:35:24] happened to me
[1:35:29] not just how when people stay alone in
[1:35:32] praising
[1:35:33] and they come out
[1:35:36] they cannot associate with the word with
[1:35:38] a free word because they're being so
[1:35:40] locked in praising
[1:35:43] and that's the same way we behave to our
[1:35:45] phones
[1:35:48] there is something about praising
[1:35:53] God
[1:35:54] design in the back part of his mind
[1:36:00] for him to deal with man
[1:36:03] and get man's attention
[1:36:06] he have to imprison him
[1:36:13] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:36:16] I have your mind running all over the
[1:36:18] place this morning it's okay
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:27] Joseph went to praise in Jeremiah
[1:36:30] make higher
[1:36:32] and John the Baptist
[1:36:35] Peter
[1:36:36] and something
[1:36:39] he had to pick up his whole praising
[1:36:41] Gates on his shoulder praise the Lord
[1:36:44] took his prison gate to the mountain
[1:36:47] I hope the Lord can help us to pick up
[1:36:49] our praising gifts this morning amen I
[1:36:52] hope that we'll be able to get courage
[1:36:53] to be able to pick up our praise engage
[1:37:00] but there was something about praising
[1:37:05] God
[1:37:07] almighty God
[1:37:11] even our lord Jesus how to go to praise
[1:37:14] him
[1:37:16] oh yeah
[1:37:18] during this hour his last hour on the
[1:37:21] Earth
[1:37:24] for them to transfer him to go and see
[1:37:26] hero they got to keep him in praising
[1:37:27] for the next day
[1:37:36] and you see it's just like all around
[1:37:38] the world the prisons are not the same
[1:37:46] here you have praising where prisoners
[1:37:48] have television
[1:37:50] they're out of places you have praising
[1:37:52] we're praising us are confound to one
[1:37:55] condition
[1:37:57] they are in a prison like this they
[1:37:59] cannot go down they cannot come up
[1:38:05] they cannot go they can't sit down the
[1:38:07] prison is designed for them to be in
[1:38:10] this condition
[1:38:13] there are pigs all honor them you go
[1:38:16] down you're going to harm yourself you
[1:38:17] go up you're going to bleed yourself
[1:38:21] so all the presence around the world are
[1:38:24] different
[1:38:29] and that's the same way as as
[1:38:31] individuals
[1:38:34] our praising houses are different also
[1:38:40] and the things that are embracing in our
[1:38:42] lives
[1:38:43] are also different
[1:38:54] praise the Lord
[1:38:57] should we pray and go home
[1:39:02] it looks like everybody is captured this
[1:39:04] morning
[1:39:07] we can just committed the rest to the
[1:39:10] Lord and say holy ghost just deal with
[1:39:12] the people speak to their hearts
[1:39:17] but there is something about praising
[1:39:24] that God himself
[1:39:27] he says the heaven is my throne
[1:39:31] the Earth
[1:39:33] is my first tool
[1:39:36] but a body
[1:39:38] will thou prepare me
[1:39:42] God have all of this free space
[1:39:46] but yet
[1:39:48] he want a body
[1:39:51] to do it in
[1:39:53] in so much that the Apostle Paul was
[1:39:56] said
[1:39:57] the spirit of the Prophet is subject to
[1:40:00] the prophet
[1:40:02] they are almighty God gives you the Holy
[1:40:04] Ghost
[1:40:05] but yet in dealing with you he's going
[1:40:08] to be subject to your will
[1:40:13] praise the Lord
[1:40:19] because when you are in prison you don't
[1:40:21] control the people that praising you the
[1:40:23] people that impressing you they control
[1:40:25] you
[1:40:29] they tell you how to dress
[1:40:36] the Lord
[1:40:38] no one carried their suitcases to praise
[1:40:40] him
[1:40:44] amen when you got a prison
[1:40:47] there's a close ready there for you
[1:40:51] praise the Lord
[1:40:53] all your juries they are all for the
[1:40:55] free word
[1:40:59] and in thou praising
[1:41:03] everybody looks alike
[1:41:08] so you think about it
[1:41:10] think about it now because brother
[1:41:12] Branham used this now that's the reason
[1:41:15] why he said yeah as I read he says uh he
[1:41:20] says I believe the Apostle men just not
[1:41:23] exactly addressing it in his present
[1:41:27] condition and do you also realize yeah
[1:41:31] I'm ahead of myself you know because I
[1:41:34] myself I'm trying to discover what I
[1:41:36] want to preach this morning
[1:41:38] do you also realize
[1:41:41] that it took Paul in those praising
[1:41:44] conditions
[1:41:46] to write the book of Ephesians
[1:41:51] the letter to the collusions
[1:41:55] and the book of
[1:41:57] Philippians
[1:42:01] praise the Lord
[1:42:04] I did this I did a little a little
[1:42:07] sketch of Paul of the events of poor
[1:42:10] life
[1:42:14] the first time
[1:42:16] he will he will be seen in the scripture
[1:42:18] the first time he will see him that one
[1:42:20] of the first action that we would know
[1:42:22] about this man
[1:42:23] he was a man that held the court was
[1:42:26] Stephen was stoned
[1:42:30] and right after the
[1:42:32] he got converted on the road of Damascus
[1:42:37] in the Arabian Desert
[1:42:41] during the next three years
[1:42:44] he was fought to flee from Damascus in a
[1:42:48] basket
[1:42:49] and then Paul spent 10 years
[1:42:52] in his own setting
[1:42:54] Saul of tashes
[1:42:57] he spent 10 years why because now Paul
[1:43:00] has been converted
[1:43:02] but he was isolated
[1:43:05] the Christians will not accept him
[1:43:08] because they are not sure
[1:43:11] he cannot go back to Judaism
[1:43:14] because they felt like he betrayed him
[1:43:18] so for 10 years
[1:43:21] Paul was in isolation right in his own
[1:43:25] setting every time he will go over to uh
[1:43:29] to the to the to the selling gas and all
[1:43:32] you he would try to tell these people
[1:43:34] about his experience on the road of
[1:43:36] Damascus and everybody you know what
[1:43:38] they don't they don't want to have
[1:43:40] anything to do with him
[1:43:42] praise the Lord
[1:43:44] so for 10 years
[1:43:47] he was in a prison
[1:43:51] amen
[1:43:53] the Christians don't want to have
[1:43:55] anything to do with him this is the man
[1:43:56] that was persecuting I mean Paul was
[1:43:59] well known
[1:44:05] but it was Barnabas
[1:44:07] that brought Paul
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:14] where the Holy Ghost speaks and says
[1:44:16] separate me in Barnabas and Paul
[1:44:20] Brandon Bass was the one that brought
[1:44:22] Paul
[1:44:24] and introduced him to the apostles
[1:44:28] I believe that he sat one time and
[1:44:31] listened to Paul speaking
[1:44:33] and he realized that this man had
[1:44:36] another approached to the scripture
[1:44:39] this man he was caught different
[1:44:44] praise the Lord
[1:44:45] because remember after Paul got saved
[1:44:50] he stayed right there in Damascus so
[1:44:52] that time in Damascus I call into
[1:44:55] historians he spent three years on the
[1:44:58] back side of the desert trying to
[1:45:01] reconcile this light that caught itself
[1:45:05] Jesus
[1:45:09] he knew the light to be the pillar of
[1:45:11] fire but yet the light says I am Jesus
[1:45:14] whom you are persecuting
[1:45:17] Paul was trying to reconcile the Jehovah
[1:45:20] of the Old Testament
[1:45:22] with the Jesus of the new
[1:45:25] praise the Lord
[1:45:27] he spent three years
[1:45:29] and when he came out
[1:45:32] he was completely different
[1:45:34] until even the picture that the keys was
[1:45:37] giving told Peter said Paul spoke things
[1:45:40] that were hard to understand
[1:45:46] praise the Lord
[1:45:54] so he spent 10 years in Texas in
[1:45:57] Barnabas
[1:45:58] brought him to Antioch
[1:46:02] and then when the Holy Ghost said
[1:46:04] separate me Paul and Barnabas that was
[1:46:07] where Paul started his first missionary
[1:46:10] journey
[1:46:12] praise the Lord when we started talking
[1:46:15] about Paul the apostles we'll go over
[1:46:16] all of these I'm I'm just trying to run
[1:46:20] through some things here
[1:46:22] then as chapter 15 he was brought to the
[1:46:25] council
[1:46:27] when the when the Believers were were
[1:46:29] they were they were announced they were
[1:46:32] discussing how how they should treat the
[1:46:34] Gentiles that are now being safe
[1:46:38] praise the Lord you have to realize that
[1:46:41] these are Jewish
[1:46:43] Jewish Believers people that were that
[1:46:46] were that were circumcised on the eighth
[1:46:48] day they were taught the Torah in all of
[1:46:50] these things
[1:46:51] amen
[1:46:53] they have now God received the Holy
[1:46:55] Ghost and all of them and they realized
[1:46:57] that Gentiles are being saved they are
[1:47:00] now in a crisis how do we handle these
[1:47:02] people
[1:47:04] praise the Lord
[1:47:07] because Peter himself had a first-hand
[1:47:10] witness
[1:47:12] he hired a first-hand witness that why
[1:47:15] he stood in colena's house
[1:47:18] these people that were not baptized just
[1:47:22] by the preaching of the words there was
[1:47:25] something in this Gentile Believers that
[1:47:27] knew how to pull God out of heaven
[1:47:30] when Peter preached the word the Holy
[1:47:34] Ghost fell on them
[1:47:38] praise the Lord
[1:47:40] Hallelujah when you go and read as
[1:47:43] chapter 15 I'm all over the place but
[1:47:45] that's good
[1:47:46] when you reacts chapter 15 you will
[1:47:49] realize that the apostles they said
[1:47:51] something that is very is placed in a
[1:47:53] very corny way
[1:47:55] they said that it it seems like we need
[1:48:00] to receive the law like these Gentiles
[1:48:03] did they they have seen the Gentile way
[1:48:07] that the way God was dealing with the
[1:48:10] Gentiles amen then the way they the Jews
[1:48:14] I mean there were a lot of things they
[1:48:16] had to struggle with
[1:48:19] because these people were bringing in uh
[1:48:23] uh Judaism
[1:48:25] and whether you like it or not every one
[1:48:29] of us go through the same amen if you
[1:48:32] are if you were you grown up in a
[1:48:35] Methodist Church or in a in a Baptist
[1:48:37] Church or uh whatever was at the place
[1:48:41] that you've grown you learn the way they
[1:48:43] do things and now when you are born
[1:48:45] again don't think that you just change
[1:48:47] automatically no all of those things
[1:48:50] that you learn you carry it along
[1:48:53] that's the reason why some people that
[1:48:56] came through a Pentecostal Church they
[1:48:58] are always firing while the other
[1:49:00] Melodies people there you know they know
[1:49:02] how to paint things you know they sit
[1:49:04] there
[1:49:05] it does not make that one that is firing
[1:49:09] more religious than the other one or
[1:49:11] more spiritual than the other one no it
[1:49:13] is just that we carry those things along
[1:49:16] until God will now finally bring us to a
[1:49:19] birth
[1:49:22] so that was the same thing that these
[1:49:24] Jewish I believe us was struggling with
[1:49:27] there is Gentiles they never know how to
[1:49:30] watch their hands before eating
[1:49:33] praise the Lord
[1:49:35] when it comes to eat all the Jewish
[1:49:37] believer oh wow
[1:49:40] praise the Lord these guys don't wash
[1:49:42] their hands they don't even pray
[1:49:45] amen
[1:49:47] glory be to God
[1:49:49] even with the Apostle Peter that was
[1:49:52] trying try he was the man to have the
[1:49:55] key he was the one that opened the
[1:49:57] kingdom to the to the to the Gentiles in
[1:50:00] the house of Colina he was trying his
[1:50:02] best but yeah when he saw another Jews
[1:50:05] coming
[1:50:06] try to pull back
[1:50:08] Paul never spare him for that no
[1:50:12] praise the Lord
[1:50:15] so you see that the the the environment
[1:50:18] that we grew up the church you grew up
[1:50:21] in your you had a certain way of doing
[1:50:23] things like that you have you have a
[1:50:26] certain way you know the message was
[1:50:27] preached to you and all of that it does
[1:50:30] not make you better than the other
[1:50:31] person
[1:50:32] you know what it does it just put you in
[1:50:35] a separate prison
[1:50:37] and the other man is in his praising
[1:50:41] praise the Lord adjust that in your
[1:50:43] praising your things are arranged more
[1:50:46] decently
[1:50:47] in his praising he don't have even food
[1:50:49] he don't get television
[1:50:53] are we together
[1:51:02] so Paul goes on his first missionary
[1:51:04] journey
[1:51:05] after the council or before the council
[1:51:08] after the council then now Paul started
[1:51:11] reaching out that's how Paul started
[1:51:14] reaching out to the Gentiles that's how
[1:51:16] he he he took on the apostleship for the
[1:51:20] Gentiles praise the Lord
[1:51:22] and after that council meeting even when
[1:51:25] he came back he came back to the council
[1:51:28] because uh since the Jews refused him
[1:51:31] Paul was reaching out I mean he was he
[1:51:34] was doing his own thing he was reaching
[1:51:35] out
[1:51:37] he was so convinced of his experience on
[1:51:41] the road of Damascus that he did not
[1:51:42] need a council to support him right
[1:51:45] praise the Lord
[1:51:46] he did not needed a counsel to support
[1:51:48] him he was ready to tell his testimony
[1:51:51] to whoever he meets on the street
[1:51:54] as long as you were less empowered talk
[1:51:57] and even when you are going he's talking
[1:51:59] behind you
[1:52:01] praise the Lord
[1:52:10] now Paul
[1:52:12] will have his first arrest
[1:52:15] in 1858
[1:52:19] he was in praising for two years
[1:52:23] this was more like a house arrest
[1:52:28] praise the Lord if you read a book of us
[1:52:30] you will realize this was the time where
[1:52:33] Paul
[1:52:34] was brought
[1:52:36] before uh uh uh Caesar he was supposed
[1:52:39] to be taken before Caesar and and the
[1:52:42] Jews said he was blaspheming and then
[1:52:45] and then and then the Romans came and
[1:52:46] arrested him
[1:52:49] and in the air Paul told them will you
[1:52:51] treat a rumor like this
[1:52:54] they said oh are you a Roman he said
[1:52:56] yeah I have Roman citizenship
[1:52:59] so actually the embracing poor to
[1:53:02] protect him
[1:53:06] praise the Lord
[1:53:07] because Paul hired Roman citizenship
[1:53:10] that he acquired through his father
[1:53:13] when we're talking about Paul
[1:53:15] uh a servant of Jesus Christ will go
[1:53:18] through that
[1:53:20] now so uh he was in praising and then he
[1:53:25] appeared before Caesar
[1:53:28] and then on his way to Rome that was
[1:53:30] where he had a shipwreck
[1:53:33] when the the the the the the snake was
[1:53:37] on his hand and all of that
[1:53:40] that was this is a little little of poor
[1:53:43] Journey
[1:53:53] then he had a house arrest that was
[1:53:55] where he wrote efficient the book of
[1:53:58] Philippine and and collusion
[1:54:02] then he was equated after that
[1:54:07] then he wrote trimite he his first
[1:54:10] letter to terminated and also to to
[1:54:11] Titus
[1:54:13] praise the Lord
[1:54:16] then he was now arrested and he knew by
[1:54:19] this time he was dumb
[1:54:21] we had him in the dungeon
[1:54:25] and that was where he wrote that letter
[1:54:27] to Timothy I have run my course
[1:54:31] I run I fight a good fight
[1:54:33] he wrote that from the dungeon
[1:54:37] praise the Lord
[1:54:42] so we so we see that Paul writing this
[1:54:45] letter
[1:54:47] to uh
[1:54:49] uh phaliman it was not just to complain
[1:54:54] that oh I'm in praising
[1:54:57] they are beating me every day
[1:55:00] you know uh uh you know you're playing
[1:55:04] with the gospel down there I'm suffering
[1:55:07] no that was not Paul message
[1:55:10] that was not the reason why he was
[1:55:12] writing but you think about it we will
[1:55:15] not have the Book of Revelation
[1:55:18] until John
[1:55:21] was thrown on the island of Patmos
[1:55:24] they're in praising him on the island of
[1:55:27] Patmos yes
[1:55:28] and then God found him now to a place
[1:55:33] all by himself
[1:55:38] are you are you grabbing the concept
[1:55:42] that why God will put us in the prison
[1:55:45] that's the time that God loved
[1:55:49] he loved that time
[1:55:52] when you are locked up
[1:55:56] in your mind
[1:55:59] when you are praising
[1:56:02] in your mind you are shut up
[1:56:05] praise the Lord
[1:56:07] it will surprise you
[1:56:08] but let me read this to you before I go
[1:56:11] any father
[1:56:13] Brown said you have heard that all song
[1:56:18] you think
[1:56:21] and then I'm shocking with God
[1:56:25] I want to be shocked in with God
[1:56:28] now is where I thought of this
[1:56:32] being shot in with God
[1:56:35] chatting with God in the secret place
[1:56:38] brother Branham says that's where my
[1:56:40] inspiration came from
[1:56:43] what is it to be shot in with God
[1:56:49] what is it to be shot in with God
[1:56:57] praise the Lord
[1:56:58] amen God great purpose
[1:57:03] of drinking Israel into Egypt who have
[1:57:08] never been fulfilled
[1:57:10] if Joseph would have gained all the
[1:57:13] favor
[1:57:14] that he how was Spotify
[1:57:18] God had to switch the wheel around
[1:57:21] and lustful Spirit came over part of our
[1:57:24] wife
[1:57:28] and now she won this boy for a boyfriend
[1:57:33] but young Joseph will not sell his
[1:57:35] breath right
[1:57:38] but you have to realize it's beyond the
[1:57:41] will of Joseph almighty God is the one
[1:57:44] driving the wheel
[1:57:46] that I have a purpose of redemption
[1:57:49] and to fulfill this purpose I have to
[1:57:52] lock this ball up in praising
[1:58:01] amen it is in prison
[1:58:05] that Joseph
[1:58:06] will self-convenient
[1:58:10] you really enjoy communion in prison
[1:58:18] then Joseph said the one
[1:58:22] and that's where her prophetic gift was
[1:58:25] known
[1:58:27] and that's what will bring him to the
[1:58:29] throne
[1:58:31] and Israel comes to Egypt
[1:58:35] and God's Plan of Redemption
[1:58:45] praise the Lord
[1:58:49] I mean if you lock yourself up
[1:58:53] and you have the key
[1:58:55] that's not a prison
[1:59:00] some of us the president we are in we
[1:59:02] having a key
[1:59:05] that's not a prison
[1:59:07] the keys must be in the hands of another
[1:59:09] person
[1:59:15] if you have the keys it's not a prison
[1:59:19] you just don't want to talk to anybody
[1:59:22] you are just having your mood swings
[1:59:29] you cut your phone off
[1:59:35] you don't want to know for anybody to
[1:59:36] know what you are doing the day you

[1:59:40] then you come and says oh love you
[1:59:43] brother God bless you Sister God bless

[2:00:03] The Prisoner do not have a key to his
[2:00:05] own praising
[2:00:08] someone else's has the key
[2:00:13] glory be to God
[2:00:21] but you see that sir I realized my time
[2:00:24] is getting off here I've not even
[2:00:26] started yet
[2:00:28] but you see yes uh
[2:00:31] you know I saw
[2:00:33] uh
[2:00:36] Birdman will help us to to realize here
[2:00:39] is that
[2:00:41] finally finally
[2:00:44] finally
[2:00:46] God will get himself
[2:00:49] a prisoner of love
[2:00:52] finally
[2:00:54] finally
[2:00:57] amen we deal with the the praising of
[2:01:01] our human nature we deal with acne
[2:01:04] prison and and self-present and
[2:01:06] different praising we deal with and and
[2:01:08] but finally
[2:01:10] when God comes down and start dealing
[2:01:12] with a man or dealing with a woman
[2:01:14] finally
[2:01:17] he will bring us true gradually where he
[2:01:20] will get himself
[2:01:22] a prisoner of love someone that loves to
[2:01:26] be in the will of God
[2:01:30] that Lord that enjoy
[2:01:33] when I says everything were for good to
[2:01:36] them that loved the Lord

[2:02:05] Year Praise the Lord
[2:02:08] but finally that's what God
[2:02:12] is doing to this bride his purpose of
[2:02:15] having a preeminist
[2:02:18] he also have a people
[2:02:21] that he can get in the confine of his
[2:02:23] will
[2:02:24] a people that we enjoy being in the word
[2:02:29] of God
[2:02:30] whenever they understand that their step
[2:02:33] or their thoughts or their action is not
[2:02:36] pleasing to God it will bother them so
[2:02:38] much right yeah they were had to know
[2:02:42] that they are they are pleasing
[2:02:43] themselves
[2:02:45] they will always be their question
[2:02:49] what would Jesus do
[2:02:52] what is God thinking about my action
[2:02:57] is this thing I'm doing the same
[2:02:59] pleasing to God
[2:03:01] will finally get a people
[2:03:12] that we get into the prison
[2:03:15] of his will
[2:03:19] but I just wanted to establish with you
[2:03:21] this morning
[2:03:23] now after all
[2:03:26] praising is not a bad place
[2:03:30] because what are you lacking or not you
[2:03:32] are in one
[2:03:35] you are in one
[2:03:37] your true potential is here
[2:03:40] it's his badge they have your mark shot
[2:03:42] on it
[2:03:44] praise the Lord
[2:03:46] amen
[2:03:49] your true potential is hate
[2:03:52] behind those bars
[2:03:54] it's a bias of Bones
[2:04:03] what are you lacking on that
[2:04:11] you are a prisoner this morning
[2:04:16] you are a prisoner this morning
[2:04:19] you might not be a prisoner of love yet
[2:04:23] maybe you are a prisoner to your own
[2:04:25] will
[2:04:29] you find people on the street that are
[2:04:31] praising us to drugs
[2:04:35] young people prayer you know all around
[2:04:38] us prisoner to sex
[2:04:42] prisoner to all the evil things that is
[2:04:45] happening there is something that is
[2:04:46] driving them they don't have their own
[2:04:48] will they are locked out in there
[2:04:51] if you will ask them they want to be
[2:04:53] better than that
[2:05:02] behind those desires
[2:05:06] true
[2:05:09] some of us are locked up in our mind
[2:05:14] we are in a dungeon that is so dark
[2:05:23] praise the Lord
[2:05:24] when you just find a person that is just
[2:05:27] just negative everything they are just
[2:05:29] seeing spirits coming from all over
[2:05:31] that's what happened in the dungeon
[2:05:35] dark
[2:05:38] make you afraid
[2:05:43] some people are so block out in their
[2:05:45] mind in their spirit
[2:05:58] it's God's design
[2:06:02] for God to manifest his will
[2:06:05] and make knew his attributes he had to
[2:06:09] praise himself
[2:06:12] he had to prison himself
[2:06:15] why because God
[2:06:18] how to condense himself put himself in a
[2:06:21] state that he had to allow something to
[2:06:24] happen why would God allow us to get
[2:06:27] sick
[2:06:28] just for us to know that he's a Healer
[2:06:33] so he he embraced himself
[2:06:38] to our weakness
[2:06:41] he limits himself
[2:06:44] there is no way that he will make his
[2:06:46] attributes no
[2:06:50] until he put himself behind our free
[2:06:52] moral agency
[2:06:54] he says okay I will wait for them to
[2:06:56] choose now I want to choose whatever
[2:06:57] they will do then I will come and show
[2:06:59] myself a deliverer almighty God do that
[2:07:08] why would he do that
[2:07:20] this man on the backside of the desert
[2:07:23] God could just revealed to him
[2:07:26] he could reveal to him and and I want
[2:07:29] you to write the book of uh uh a
[2:07:31] collusion write the book of Ephesians
[2:07:33] why would God wait for Paul to get in
[2:07:36] prison
[2:07:37] right
[2:07:38] because sometimes that's when he get the
[2:07:41] best out of us
[2:07:44] when we are shouting with God
[2:07:49] praise the Lord
[2:07:54] amen
[2:07:56] it is God that wrote
[2:07:58] the five law of language
[2:08:01] and God lacks quality time
[2:08:06] and sometimes the way that he can get
[2:08:09] quality time out of us
[2:08:12] is to lock us and carry the key
[2:08:16] praise the Lord
[2:08:19] then he comes through the window and
[2:08:21] they enter
[2:08:22] he says I'm here with you
[2:08:25] oh Lord Jesus
[2:08:27] well I just want to spend time with you
[2:08:36] again the short break in the Sheep leg
[2:08:39] he said you look at the Shepherd from
[2:08:41] fire you will think that he's cruel
[2:08:44] but if you look in the heart of the
[2:08:46] shepherd it's an expression of love
[2:08:49] right
[2:08:51] sir it's an expression of love
[2:09:00] God own people the Jews who they have
[2:09:05] history the history of praising and
[2:09:09] slavery in their entire history
[2:09:13] praising and slavery
[2:09:19] praise the Lord
[2:09:23] and do you realize that's one of the
[2:09:25] team of the of of uh of uh of the ATS
[2:09:28] movement
[2:09:30] because they're trying to prove that
[2:09:31] slavery is from the Bible but you don't
[2:09:34] understand the purpose
[2:09:36] you don't understand the purpose
[2:09:39] praise the Lord
[2:09:41] you have just got so messed up into the
[2:09:43] politics
[2:09:46] that you don't understand the purpose
[2:09:48] why God designed that
[2:09:56] do you also know that the early church
[2:09:59] the early Christian Church
[2:10:01] was made out of praising us
[2:10:05] and people that were that were slaves
[2:10:07] worker
[2:10:09] that's exactly why Paul is addressing
[2:10:11] here in the book of alimon this is a
[2:10:14] slave that ran away from his master
[2:10:20] this is a slave that ran away from his
[2:10:22] master he might have robbed him or take
[2:10:24] something and he ran away
[2:10:31] he got arrested they be thrown in the
[2:10:34] same prison with Paul
[2:10:38] and when Paul brought him to Faith
[2:10:41] then Paul realized that
[2:10:44] his master
[2:10:46] was also a son of Paul
[2:10:51] praise the Lord
[2:10:53] because Fatima was a he was a convert of
[2:10:55] Paul
[2:11:00] so now Paul is selling this slave back
[2:11:03] to his master
[2:11:05] but charging the master
[2:11:08] and now he's a brother
[2:11:11] he's now yours he he I'm not saying that
[2:11:14] he's not your slave
[2:11:16] but the most emphasis here he's a
[2:11:18] brother
[2:11:22] praise the Lord you read a letter you
[2:11:24] realize Paul never instructed him to set
[2:11:26] the man free
[2:11:27] Paul instructed him
[2:11:30] to discern
[2:11:34] yeah he's not coming back as a runaway
[2:11:37] slave he's coming back as a brother
[2:11:44] praise the Lord
[2:11:45] you have to picture in the book of Acts
[2:11:48] there were many many of those groups
[2:11:50] home groups were the Masters and their
[2:11:53] slave uh uh uh people that were slipped
[2:11:56] to them were coming right there to be
[2:11:58] preached home
[2:12:08] why were God why will God
[2:12:13] you see because the fall put us
[2:12:17] enslaved
[2:12:20] by the Fall we became slave to sin
[2:12:25] we became slave to our own
[2:12:28] evil desires
[2:12:32] so you might have never been on a ship
[2:12:35] in Chains
[2:12:36] your physical body may have never gone
[2:12:39] unawipped
[2:12:40] but nobody here will tell me that their
[2:12:43] spirit
[2:12:44] has not been under one suppression
[2:12:47] or another
[2:12:49] that the devil has never come back to
[2:12:51] whip your mind over and over for the
[2:12:54] wrong that you have done
[2:13:04] so you see in a great that the big
[2:13:06] picture of God's mind looking at right
[2:13:09] from the beginning
[2:13:10] that man by his free moral agents saying
[2:13:14] will trap himself
[2:13:17] he will trap or enslave himself
[2:13:22] and then God will have to come down and
[2:13:25] break that chains of slavery by his
[2:13:28] spirit
[2:13:30] praise the Lord And yet when he free man
[2:13:33] he will not allow the man to have his
[2:13:36] own will but he will put him in another
[2:13:38] prison
[2:13:40] yeah
[2:13:41] because God understands I think that's
[2:13:44] the best way that man can live
[2:13:51] praise the Lord
[2:13:58] are we together this morning
[2:14:00] amen
[2:14:02] have I gone all over the place just
[2:14:03] shouting making noise and you don't
[2:14:06] understand what I'm talking about
[2:14:10] I don't have problems starting over
[2:14:15] I might not say it like the way I said
[2:14:16] it first but I don't have no problem to
[2:14:18] start over
[2:14:21] I mean even if you don't want it today I
[2:14:24] can do it another day
[2:14:29] but I'm just trying to help us to
[2:14:31] realize that's the purpose here
[2:14:34] there's a purpose
[2:14:36] but then brought a brand I'm saying your
[2:14:39] family
[2:14:40] finally
[2:14:42] it took all of these ages
[2:14:46] to bring us to the age where the mind of
[2:14:49] God
[2:14:50] will be released to the people for them
[2:14:53] to finally realize why God allowed all
[2:14:57] of this praising and slavery all through
[2:14:59] history
[2:15:01] it was not to make one man Superior and
[2:15:04] to make another man inferior
[2:15:07] that's politics
[2:15:08] that's what the news want to sell to us
[2:15:12] and if you are a born-again child of God
[2:15:14] you get your spirit all mess in that I
[2:15:16] mean you will just destroy yourself
[2:15:18] because there is no way you will be able
[2:15:20] to project the love of God
[2:15:23] because your mind is all caught up in
[2:15:25] the politics of the word
[2:15:28] thinking that one group is superior over
[2:15:30] another that was not God's purpose
[2:15:43] praise the Lord
[2:15:45] Hallelujah
[2:15:47] it's so sad that you find people
[2:15:49] claiming to have the Holy Ghost they are
[2:15:51] so tied into that
[2:15:55] praise the Lord
[2:15:57] your mind is just they are so I mean
[2:16:00] their spirit is just locked up in that
[2:16:13] prisoner of love
[2:16:16] that's cause
[2:16:18] purpose that's where he wants to bring
[2:16:20] us to
[2:16:23] I was sitting there and just just
[2:16:25] thinking about this
[2:16:27] Broadband said
[2:16:29] over in the book of Corinthian process
[2:16:33] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[2:16:40] and then so Timothy he said Paul at 7.
[2:16:44] of Jesus Christ now you have to realize
[2:16:46] that Timothy was a pastor
[2:16:49] and Paul had to approach him like that
[2:16:53] because Paul wanted him to understand
[2:16:55] the purpose of the ministry
[2:17:01] amen
[2:17:03] so we find that right in there we can
[2:17:05] see the purpose and the work of the
[2:17:08] ministry
[2:17:10] as an apostle
[2:17:12] the purpose is to reach out
[2:17:15] and be ready to reach everyone
[2:17:18] and be ready to reach anyone
[2:17:21] praise the Lord
[2:17:22] amen
[2:17:24] one that is sin
[2:17:27] is not just on a sin to his tribe
[2:17:34] and as a servant of Jesus Christ it
[2:17:37] destroyed the work of the ministry you
[2:17:40] are not sent to bust the people you are
[2:17:43] sent as a servant to Serve the People
[2:17:51] and you can own it fulfill
[2:17:55] the apostleship the seventh shape when
[2:17:58] you are a prisoner
[2:18:00] to his will
[2:18:02] when you are going with your own
[2:18:03] ambition and selfish desire you will
[2:18:07] never fulfill God's purpose
