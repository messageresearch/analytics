[1:03] [Music]
[1:06] to join in the attack upon the true
[1:07] believers who had the word and the signs
[1:10] and wonders with them thus some
[1:12] priscillaists were brought to trees by
[1:14] bishop ithacas 385
[1:17] he accused them of witchcraft and
[1:19] immorality and many were executed
[1:22] martin of tour and ambrose of milan
[1:24] protested this and pleaded in vain for
[1:26] the persecution to cease
[1:28] when the persecution was prolonged these
[1:30] two bishops refused to fellowship with
[1:32] bishop hidatas and others like him
[1:36] strange to say the synod in trees
[1:38] approved of the murders
[1:40] from this time on especially through the
[1:42] dark ages we will see the children of
[1:44] the flesh persecute and destroy the
[1:46] children of the spirit
[1:47] though both claim one father even as was
[1:50] in the case of ishmael and isaac
[1:52] the darkness of spiritual corruption
[1:53] will deepen and the true light of god
[1:55] will fade until number wise it glows
[1:58] ever so faintly
[1:59] yet the promise of god will hold true
[2:02] the light shineth in darkness and the
[2:04] darkness can do nothing about it
[2:07] now up to this time i have not brought
[2:09] out that point in history that i
[2:10] promised to cover
[2:12] that is the intermingling of the
[2:13] religion of nimrod and the christian
[2:15] religion
[2:16] you will recall that adolescent babylon
[2:18] to pergamos and set up his kingdom
[2:20] outside the reaches of the roman empire
[2:23] it flourished over the years nurtured by
[2:25] the god of this world
[2:26] a succession of priest kings followed
[2:28] atolus until the reign of atlas iii
[2:31] when for reasons known only in the
[2:33] sovereignty of god he willed the kingdom
[2:35] to rome
[2:36] julius caesar then took both the kingdom
[2:39] physical and spiritual for he became
[2:41] pontiff maximus of the babylonish
[2:43] religion and was therefore priest king
[2:46] this title passed on to the following
[2:48] emperors until the time of maximus the
[2:50] third who refused it
[2:52] according to stephen's history it was
[2:54] then that the pope took the headship the
[2:56] emperor rejected and today there is
[2:58] still a pontiff in the world
[3:00] and he is truly pontiff maximus
[3:03] he wears a triple crown and resides in
[3:05] rome
[3:06] and in revelation 17 god does not any
[3:09] longer refer to pergamus as satan's seat
[3:11] nor does he say that is where satan
[3:13] dwells
[3:14] no the throne room is no longer in
[3:16] pergamos but it is mystery babylon
[3:19] it is not in babylon but in mystery
[3:21] babylon
[3:23] it is in a city on seven hills
[3:25] its head is antichrist for he has
[3:27] usurped the position of christ who alone
[3:30] is mediator and who alone can forgive
[3:32] sins
[3:33] yes pontiff maximus is with us today
[3:36] the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[3:39] revelation 2 15
[3:42] so hast thou also them that hold the
[3:44] doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing
[3:46] i hate
[3:48] you will recall that i brought out in
[3:49] the ephesian age that the word
[3:51] nicolaitan comes from two greek words
[3:54] niko which means to conquer and leo
[3:57] which means the laity
[3:59] nicolaitan means to conquer the laity
[4:02] now why is this such a terrible thing
[4:05] it is terrible because god has never
[4:06] placed his church in the hands of an
[4:08] elected leadership which moves with
[4:10] political mindedness
[4:12] he has placed his church in the care of
[4:13] god ordained spirit-filled word living
[4:16] men
[4:16] who lead the people through feeding them
[4:18] the word
[4:20] he has not separated the people into
[4:21] classes so that the masses are led by a
[4:23] holy priesthood
[4:25] it is true that the leadership must be
[4:27] holy but then so must be the whole
[4:29] congregation
[4:30] further there is no place in the word
[4:32] where priests or ministers or such
[4:34] mediate between god and the people nor
[4:37] is there a place where they are
[4:38] separated in their worship of the lord
[4:41] god wants all to love and serve him
[4:43] together
[4:44] nicolaitanism destroys those precepts
[4:46] and instead separates the ministers from
[4:49] the people and makes the leaders
[4:50] overlords instead of servants
[4:52] now this doctrine actually started as a
[4:54] deed in the first age
[4:56] it appears that the problem lay in two
[4:58] words
[4:59] elders presbyters and overseers bishops
[5:04] the scripture shows that there are
[5:05] several elders in each church some began
[5:08] ignatius among them to teach that the
[5:11] idea of a bishop was one of preeminence
[5:13] or authority and control over the elders
[5:16] now the truth of the matter is the word
[5:18] elder signifies who the person is
[5:21] while the word bishop signifies the
[5:23] office of the same man the elder is the
[5:25] man
[5:26] bishop is the office of the man
[5:29] elder always has and always will refer
[5:31] simply to a man's chronological age in
[5:33] the lord
[5:34] he is an elder not because he is elected
[5:37] or ordained etc but because he is older
[5:40] he is more seasoned trained not a novice
[5:44] reliable because of experience and
[5:46] long-standing proof of his christian
[5:47] experience
[5:49] but no the bishops did not stick to the
[5:51] epistles of paul but rather they went to
[5:53] paul's account of the time he called the
[5:55] elders from ephesus to miletus in acts
[5:57] 20.
[5:58] in verse 17 the record states
[6:01] elders were called and then in verse 28
[6:04] they are called overseers bishops
[6:06] and these bishops no doubt political
[6:08] minded and anxious for power insisted
[6:11] that paul had given the meaning that
[6:12] overseers were more than the local elder
[6:15] with official capacity only in his own
[6:17] church
[6:18] to them a bishop was now one with
[6:20] extended authority over many local
[6:22] leaders
[6:23] such a concept was neither scriptural
[6:25] nor historical yet even a man of the
[6:27] stature of polycarp leaned towards such
[6:29] organization
[6:31] thus that which started as a deed in the
[6:33] first age was made a literal doctrine
[6:35] and so it is today
[6:37] bishops still claim power to control men
[6:39] and deal with them as they desire
[6:41] placing them where they so will in the
[6:43] ministry
[6:44] this denies the leadership of the holy
[6:46] ghost who said separate me paul and
[6:49] barnabas for the work where unto i have
[6:51] called them
[6:52] this is anti-word and anti-christ
[6:55] matthew 20 25-28
[6:58] but jesus called them unto him and said
[7:00] ye know that the princes of the gentiles
[7:02] exercise dominion over them
[7:04] and they that are great exercise
[7:06] authority upon them
[7:08] but it shall not be so among you
[7:10] but whosoever will be great among you
[7:12] let him be your minister
[7:14] and whosoever will be chief among you
[7:16] let him be your servant
[7:18] even as the son of man came not to be
[7:20] ministered unto but to minister and to
[7:22] give his life a ransom for many
[7:25] matthew 23 8-9
[7:28] but be not ye called rabbi
[7:30] for one is your master even christ and
[7:33] all ye are brethren and call no man your
[7:36] father upon the earth for one is your
[7:38] father which is in heaven
[7:42] in order to clarify this even more let
[7:45] me explain nicolaitanism in this way
[7:47] you recall that in revelation 13 3 it
[7:50] says
[7:51] and i saw one of his heads as it were
[7:53] wounded to death
[7:55] and his deadly wound was healed
[7:57] and all the world wandered after the
[7:59] beast
[8:00] now we know that the wounded head was
[8:02] the pagan roman empire that great
[8:04] political world power
[8:06] this head rose again as the roman
[8:08] catholic spiritual empire
[8:10] now watch this carefully
[8:12] what did political pagan rome do that
[8:14] was the basis of her success
[8:16] she divided and conquered
[8:19] that was the seed of rome divide and
[8:21] conquer her iron teeth tore and devoured
[8:24] whom she tore and devoured could not
[8:26] rise again as when she destroyed
[8:28] carthage and sowed her to salt
[8:30] the same iron seed remained in her when
[8:32] she arose as the false church and her
[8:35] policy has remained the same
[8:37] divide and conquer
[8:39] that is nicolaitanism and god hates it
[8:43] now it is a well-known historical fact
[8:45] that when this error crept into the
[8:47] church men began to vie for the office
[8:49] of bishop with the result that this
[8:51] position was being given to the more
[8:53] educated and materially progressive and
[8:55] politically minded men
[8:57] human knowledge and program began to
[8:59] take over divine wisdom's place and the
[9:01] holy spirit no longer controlled
[9:04] this was indeed a tragic evil for the
[9:07] bishops began to maintain that it no
[9:09] longer required a transparent christian
[9:11] character to minister either the word or
[9:13] the rights in the church for it was the
[9:16] elements and the ceremony that counted
[9:18] this allowed evil men seducers to ran
[9:21] the flock
[9:23] with the man-made doctrine of the
[9:25] elevation of bishops to a place not
[9:26] accorded them in scripture the next step
[9:29] was the handing out of graded titles
[9:31] that built up into a religious hierarchy
[9:34] for soon there were archbishops over
[9:35] bishops and cardinals over the
[9:37] archbishops and by the time of boniface
[9:39] the third there was a pope overall a
[9:42] pontiff
[9:44] what with the nicolaitan doctrine and
[9:46] the amalgamation of christianity with
[9:47] babylonianism the net results had to be
[9:50] what ezekiel saw in chapter 8 10.
[9:54] so i went in and saw and behold every
[9:57] form of creeping things and abominable
[9:59] beasts and all the idols of the house of
[10:01] israel portrayed upon the wall around
[10:04] revelation 18 2
[10:07] and he cried mightily with a strong
[10:09] voice saying
[10:10] babylon the great is fallen is fallen
[10:12] and become the habitation of devils and
[10:14] the hold of every foul spirit and cage
[10:17] of every unclean and hateful bird for
[10:19] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[10:21] the wrath of her fornications
[10:24] now this nicolaitan doctrine this rule
[10:26] that was established in the church did
[10:28] not hit it off too well with the lord of
[10:30] the people
[10:31] for they could read the odd epistle or
[10:33] essay on the word written by some godly
[10:35] person
[10:36] so what did the church do
[10:38] it excommunicated the righteous teachers
[10:40] and burned the scrolls
[10:42] they said
[10:43] it takes a special education to read and
[10:46] understand the word
[10:48] why even peter said that many things
[10:49] paul wrote were hard to understand
[10:52] having taken away the word from the
[10:54] people it soon came to the people
[10:56] listening only to what the priest had to
[10:57] say and doing what he told them
[11:01] they called that god and his holy word
[11:04] they took over the minds and lives of
[11:05] the people and made them the servants of
[11:07] a despotic priesthood
[11:09] now if you want proof that the catholic
[11:11] church demands the lives and minds of
[11:13] men just listen to the edict of
[11:15] theodosius the tenth
[11:17] theodosia's first edict
[11:20] this edict was issued immediately after
[11:22] he was baptized by the first church of
[11:24] rome
[11:25] we three emperors will that our subjects
[11:28] steadfastly adhere to the religion which
[11:30] was taught by saint peter to the romans
[11:32] which has been faithfully preserved by
[11:34] tradition and which is now professed by
[11:36] the pontiff damasis of rome and peter
[11:39] bishop of alexandria a man of apostolic
[11:42] holiness according to the institution of
[11:44] the apostles and the doctrine of the
[11:46] gospel
[11:47] let us believe in one god head of the
[11:49] father the son and the holy spirit of
[11:52] equal majesty in the holy trinity
[11:55] we order that the adherents of this
[11:56] faith be called catholic christians
[11:59] we brand all the senseless followers of
[12:01] the other religions with the infamous
[12:02] name of heretics and forbid their
[12:05] conventionals assuming the name of
[12:06] churches
[12:08] besides the condemnation of divine
[12:09] justice they must expect the heavy
[12:12] penalty which our authority guided by
[12:13] heavenly wisdom shall think proper to
[12:15] inflict
[12:17] the 15 penal laws that this emperor
[12:19] issued in as many years deprived the
[12:22] evangelicals of all rights to the
[12:23] exercise of their religion excluded them
[12:26] from all civil offices and threatened
[12:28] them with fines confiscation banishment
[12:31] and even in some cases death
[12:34] do you know what
[12:35] we are headed right that way today the
[12:38] roman catholic church calls herself the
[12:40] mother church
[12:41] she calls herself the first or original
[12:43] church
[12:44] that is absolutely correct
[12:46] she was the original first church of
[12:48] rome that backslid and went into sin
[12:51] she was the first that organized
[12:53] in her was found the deeds and then the
[12:55] doctrine of nicolaitanism
[12:57] no one will deny that she is a mother
[13:00] she is a mother and has produced
[13:01] daughters
[13:02] now a daughter comes out of a woman
[13:04] a woman robed in scarlet is sitting on
[13:06] the seven hills of rome
[13:08] she is a harlot and has borne daughters
[13:11] those daughters are the protestant
[13:12] churches that came out of her and then
[13:14] went right back into organization and
[13:16] nicolaitanism
[13:18] this mother of the daughter churches is
[13:20] called a
[13:21] that is a woman who was untrue to her
[13:23] marriage vows she was married to god and
[13:26] then went off fornicating with the devil
[13:28] and in her fornications she has brought
[13:30] forth daughters that are just like her
[13:32] this mother and daughter combination is
[13:34] anti-word anti-spirit and consequently
[13:37] anti-christ
[13:38] yes anti-christ
[13:41] now before i get too far along i want to
[13:43] mention that these early bishops thought
[13:45] that they were above the word
[13:47] they told people they could forgive
[13:48] their sins upon confession of those sins
[13:51] that never was the truth
[13:53] they began to baptize infants in the
[13:55] second century they actually practiced
[13:57] regenerational baptism
[13:59] no wonder people are mixed up today if
[14:02] they were so mixed up then so close to
[14:04] pentecost now they are in a most
[14:06] desperate condition being about two
[14:08] thousand years away from original truth
[14:11] oh church of god there is only one hope
[14:14] get back to the word and stay with it
[14:19] the doctrine of balaam
[14:21] revelation 2 14
[14:25] thou hast them that hold the doctrine of
[14:26] balaam who taught balak to cast a
[14:28] stumbling block before the children of
[14:30] israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[14:32] idols and to commit fornication
[14:36] now you just can't have a nicolaitan set
[14:38] up in the church and not have this other
[14:40] doctrine come in too
[14:42] you see if you take away the word of god
[14:44] and the moving of the spirit as a means
[14:46] of worship
[14:47] they that worship me must worship me in
[14:49] spirit and in truth
[14:51] then you will have to give the people
[14:53] another form of worship as a substitute
[14:55] and substitution spells balaamism
[14:58] if we are going to understand what the
[15:00] doctrine of balaam is in the new
[15:01] testament church we had better go back
[15:04] and see what it was in the old testament
[15:06] church and apply it to that third age
[15:08] and then bring it up to the present
[15:11] the story is found in numbers chapters
[15:13] 22-25
[15:15] now we know that israel was the chosen
[15:17] people of god
[15:18] they were the pentecostals of their day
[15:21] they had taken refuge under the blood
[15:23] they had all been baptized in the red
[15:25] sea and they came up out of the water
[15:27] singing in this spirit and dancing under
[15:29] the energy of the holy ghost
[15:31] while miriam the prophetess played her
[15:33] tambourine
[15:34] well after a certain time of journeying
[15:36] these children of israel came to moab
[15:39] you remember who moab was
[15:41] he was the son of lot by one of his own
[15:43] daughters
[15:44] and lot in turn was a nephew of abraham
[15:46] so israel and moab were related i want
[15:49] you to see that the moabites knew the
[15:51] truth whether they lived up to it or not
[15:54] so israel came up to the borders of moab
[15:57] and sent messengers to the king saying
[15:59] we are brothers
[16:00] let us pass through your land
[16:02] if our people or our animals eat or
[16:04] drink anything we will gladly pay for it
[16:07] but king balak got very excited
[16:10] that head of that nicolaitan bunch was
[16:12] not about to let the church come through
[16:13] with its signs and wonders and diverse
[16:15] manifestations of the holy ghost with
[16:17] their faces shining with the glory of
[16:19] god
[16:20] it was too risky as he might lose some
[16:23] of his crowd
[16:24] so balak refused to let israel pass
[16:26] through
[16:27] in fact so great was his fear of them
[16:29] that he went to an hireling prophet
[16:31] called balaam and asked him to mediate
[16:33] between him and god and petition the
[16:35] almighty to curse israel and render them
[16:37] impotent
[16:39] and balaam being eager to take part in
[16:41] political affairs and become a great man
[16:43] was only too glad to do so
[16:45] but seeing that he had to approach to
[16:47] and receive an audience from god to get
[16:49] the people cursed as he could not do it
[16:51] by himself
[16:53] he went to ask god if he could have his
[16:54] permission to go
[16:56] now isn't that just like the nicolaitans
[16:58] we have with us today
[17:00] they curse everyone that won't go their
[17:01] way
[17:03] when balaam asked god for permission to
[17:05] go god turned him down
[17:07] my that stung
[17:08] but balak insisted promising him even
[17:11] greater rewards and honor
[17:13] so balaam went back to god
[17:15] now one answer from god should have been
[17:17] enough
[17:18] but not for self-willed balaam
[17:20] when god saw his perversity he told him
[17:22] to get up and go
[17:24] quickly he settled the donkey and the
[17:26] way he went
[17:27] he should have realized that this was
[17:29] simply god's permissive will and he
[17:31] wouldn't be able to curse them if he
[17:32] went 20 times and tried 20 times
[17:35] how like balaam are people today
[17:38] they believe in three gods get baptized
[17:40] in three titles instead of the name
[17:42] and yet god will send the spirit upon
[17:44] them as he did upon balaam
[17:46] and they will go on believing that they
[17:48] are exactly right and here they are
[17:50] actually perfect balaamites
[17:52] see the doctrine of balaam
[17:54] go ahead anyway do it your way
[17:57] they say
[17:58] well god has blessed us it must be all
[18:01] right
[18:02] i know he has blessed you i don't deny
[18:04] that
[18:05] but it's the same organizational route
[18:07] that balaam took its defiance to god's
[18:10] word
[18:11] it's false teaching
[18:14] so balaam went wildly down the road
[18:16] until an angel from god stood in his way
[18:18] but that prophet bishop cardinal
[18:20] chairman president and general overseer
[18:23] was so blinded to spiritual things by
[18:25] the thought of honor and glory and money
[18:28] that he could not see the angel standing
[18:29] withdrawn sword
[18:31] there he stood to block the mad prophet
[18:34] the little donkey saw him and dodged
[18:36] back and forth until he finally crushed
[18:38] balaam's foot against a stone wall
[18:41] the ass stopped and would not go on
[18:43] he could not
[18:44] so balaam jumped off and began beating
[18:46] him
[18:47] the donkey then began to talk to balaam
[18:50] god let that donkey speak in a tongue
[18:52] that donkey was no hybrid he was
[18:54] original seed
[18:56] he said to the blinded prophet
[18:59] am i not your donkey and haven't i
[19:00] carried you faithfully
[19:02] balaam replied
[19:04] yes yes you are my donkey and you have
[19:06] carried me faithfully until now and if i
[19:08] can't get you going i'm going to kill
[19:10] you whoa what's this talking to a donkey
[19:13] that's funny i thought i heard the
[19:15] donkey talking and i was answering it
[19:16] back
[19:18] god has always spoken in a tongue
[19:21] he spoke at belshazzar's feast and then
[19:23] at pentecost
[19:24] he is doing it again today
[19:26] it's a warning of soon coming judgment
[19:30] then the angel was made visible to
[19:31] balaam
[19:32] he told balaam that except for the
[19:34] donkey he would be dead even now for
[19:35] tempting god
[19:37] but when balaam promised to go back he
[19:39] was sent on with the admonition to say
[19:41] only what god gave him
[19:44] so balaam went down and set up seven
[19:46] altars for the clean beasts of sacrifice
[19:48] he killed a ram signifying the coming of
[19:50] the messiah he knew what to do to
[19:53] approach unto god he had the mechanics
[19:55] just right but not the dynamics same as
[19:58] now
[19:59] can't you see it nicolaitans there was
[20:02] israel down there in the valley offering
[20:03] the same sacrifice doing the same things
[20:06] but only one had the signs following
[20:09] only one had god in their midst
[20:11] form won't get you anywhere it can't
[20:14] take the place of spirit manifestation
[20:16] that is what happened at nicaea
[20:19] they put over balaam's doctrine not the
[20:21] doctrine of god
[20:22] and they stumbled yay they fell
[20:24] they became dead men
[20:27] after the sacrifice was made balaam was
[20:29] ready to prophesy
[20:31] but god tied his tongue up and he could
[20:33] not curse them he blessed them
[20:36] balak was very angry but there was
[20:38] nothing that balaam could do about the
[20:40] prophecy
[20:41] it had been spoken by the holy ghost
[20:43] so balak told balaam to go down below
[20:46] into the valley and look upon their back
[20:48] parts to see if there wasn't possibly
[20:50] some way he could curse them
[20:52] the tactics that balak used are the same
[20:54] tactics they use today
[20:56] the big denominations look down at the
[20:58] little groups and anything they find
[21:00] amongst them to make out a scandal they
[21:02] bring it out and shout it
[21:04] if the moderns live in sin no one says
[21:06] anything about it
[21:07] but let one of the elect get into
[21:09] trouble and every paper blasts it across
[21:11] the country
[21:12] yes israel had her back carnal parts
[21:16] they had their side that wasn't
[21:17] praiseworthy
[21:18] but in spite of their imperfections by
[21:20] the purpose of god that works through
[21:22] election by grace and not by works
[21:25] they had the cloud by day and the pillar
[21:27] of fire by night they had the smitten
[21:30] rock the brazen serpent and the signs
[21:32] and wonders
[21:34] they were vindicated not in themselves
[21:36] but in god
[21:39] god didn't have any respect for those
[21:41] nicolaitans with their phds llds and dds
[21:44] and all their fine organizations and the
[21:46] best that man could boast
[21:48] but he did have respect unto israel for
[21:50] they had the word vindicated amongst
[21:52] them
[21:53] certainly israel didn't look too
[21:55] polished up just having come out of
[21:57] egypt in precipitous flight but she was
[21:59] a blessed people anyway
[22:01] all she had ever known for over 300
[22:03] years was hurting flocks tending fields
[22:05] and slaving away in fear of death under
[22:07] the egyptians
[22:09] but she was free now
[22:10] she was a blessed people through the
[22:12] sovereignty of god
[22:14] certainly moab looked down on her all
[22:16] the other nations did too
[22:18] organization always looks down on the
[22:20] unorganized and either will by
[22:22] determination bring them into
[22:23] organization or destroy them when they
[22:25] won't come
[22:27] now someone might ask me
[22:28] brother branham what makes you think
[22:30] that moab was organized while israel was
[22:32] not
[22:33] where do you get that idea
[22:35] i get it right here in the bible
[22:38] it is all typed out here everything
[22:40] written in the old testament that is in
[22:42] story form is written for our admonition
[22:44] so that we can learn from it
[22:46] here it is right in numbers 23 9.
[22:50] from the top of the rocks i see him and
[22:52] from the hills i behold him though the
[22:54] people shall dwell alone and shall not
[22:56] be reckoned among the nations
[22:59] there it is
[23:00] god looking down from the top of the
[23:02] rocks not in some valley looking for
[23:04] their bad points and condemning them
[23:07] god seeing them the way he wanted to see
[23:09] them from the height of love and mercy
[23:12] they dwelt alone and they weren't
[23:14] organized they didn't have a king
[23:17] they had a prophet and the prophet had
[23:19] god in him by the spirit
[23:21] and the word came to the prophet and the
[23:23] word went to the people
[23:24] they didn't belong to the u n
[23:26] they didn't belong to the world council
[23:28] of churches to the baptists
[23:30] presbyterians assembly of god or any
[23:32] other group
[23:34] they didn't need to belong they were
[23:36] joined to god
[23:37] they didn't need counsel from any
[23:39] council they had thus saith the lord in
[23:42] their midst hallelujah
[23:45] now in spite of the fact that balaam
[23:47] knew the proper approach to god and
[23:49] could bring forth a revelation from the
[23:50] lord by means of a special endowment of
[23:52] power he was still for all of that a
[23:55] bishop in the false group
[23:57] for what did he do now in order to win
[23:59] favor with balak
[24:00] he formulated a plan wherein god would
[24:02] be forced to deal with israel in death
[24:05] just as satan knew that he could beguile
[24:07] eve cause her to fall in fleshly sin
[24:10] thus causing god to pass his pronounced
[24:13] sentence of death against sin
[24:15] so balaam knew that if he could get
[24:16] israel to sin god would have to deal
[24:19] with them in death
[24:21] so he planned a way to get them to come
[24:22] over and join in sin
[24:24] he sent out invitations to come to the
[24:26] feast of baal pior
[24:28] come over and worship with us
[24:31] now israel no doubt had seen the feasts
[24:33] of the egyptians so they did not feel it
[24:35] was too wrong to go and just look on and
[24:37] perhaps eat with the people what is
[24:39] wrong with fellowship anyway
[24:41] we are supposed to love them aren't we
[24:43] or how can we win them
[24:45] being friendly never hurt anyone or so
[24:48] they thought
[24:49] but when those sexy moabitish women
[24:51] began to dance and undress while they
[24:53] whirled around doing their rock and roll
[24:55] and twist
[24:56] the lust rose up in the israelites and
[24:58] they were drawn into adultery and god in
[25:00] wrath slew forty two thousand of them
[25:03] and that is what constantine and his
[25:05] successors did at nicaea and after
[25:07] nicaea
[25:08] they invited the people of god to the
[25:10] convention
[25:11] and when the church sat down to eat and
[25:13] rose up to play
[25:15] partaking of church form ceremonies and
[25:17] pagan feasts named after christian rites
[25:20] she was trapped she had committed
[25:22] fornication
[25:23] and god walked out
[25:26] when any man turns from the word of god
[25:28] and joins a church instead of receiving
[25:30] the holy spirit that man dies dead
[25:33] that is what he is
[25:35] don't join a church
[25:36] don't get into organization and get
[25:38] taken up with creeds and tradition or
[25:40] anything that takes the place of the
[25:42] word and the spirit or you're dead it's
[25:44] all over you're dead
[25:46] eternally separated from god
[25:50] that is what has happened in every age
[25:52] since
[25:53] god delivers the people
[25:55] they come out by the blood sanctified by
[25:57] the word
[25:58] walk through the waters of baptism and
[26:00] get filled with the spirit
[26:01] but after a while the first love cools
[26:03] off and someone gets the idea that they
[26:05] ought to organize in order to preserve
[26:07] themselves and make a name for
[26:08] themselves and they organize themselves
[26:11] right back in the second generation and
[26:13] sometimes even before then
[26:15] they no longer have the spirit of god
[26:17] just a form of worship
[26:19] they are dead
[26:20] they have hybridized themselves with
[26:22] creed and form and there is no life in
[26:24] them
[26:26] so balaam got israel to commit
[26:27] fornication
[26:29] do you know that physical fornication is
[26:31] the very same spirit that lies in
[26:32] organized religion
[26:34] i said that the spirit of fornication is
[26:36] the spirit of organization
[26:38] and all fornicators will have their
[26:40] place in the lake of fire that is what
[26:42] god thinks of organization
[26:44] yes sir the and her daughters will
[26:46] be in the lake of fire
[26:49] denominations are not of god they never
[26:52] have been and never will be
[26:54] it's a wrong spirit that separates the
[26:56] people of god into hierarchy and laity
[26:58] and it's therefore a wrong spirit that
[27:00] separates the people from the people
[27:03] that's what organization and
[27:04] denominations do
[27:06] in organizing they separate themselves
[27:09] from the word of god and bring
[27:10] themselves into spiritual adultery
[27:14] now notice that constantine gave special
[27:16] feasts unto the people
[27:18] they were the old pagan feasts with new
[27:20] names taken from the church
[27:22] or in some cases christian rites were
[27:24] taken and abused with pagan ceremonies
[27:27] he took the worship of the sun god and
[27:29] changed it to the son of god
[27:32] instead of celebrating on december 21st
[27:34] which is when they used to celebrate the
[27:36] feast to the sun god
[27:38] they put it up to december 25th and
[27:40] called it the son of god's birthday
[27:43] but we know that he was born in april
[27:45] when life comes forth not in december
[27:48] and they took the feast to astarte and
[27:49] called it the easter celebration wherein
[27:51] the christian is supposed to celebrate
[27:53] the death and resurrection of the lord
[27:56] actually it was a pagan feast to astarte
[27:59] they placed altars in the church they
[28:02] put in images
[28:03] they gave the people what they called
[28:05] the apostles creed though you can't find
[28:07] it in the bible
[28:08] they taught the people ancestor worship
[28:10] thereby making the roman catholic church
[28:12] the greatest spiritistic church in the
[28:14] world every foul bird was in that cage
[28:18] and you have the protestants with their
[28:20] organizations doing the same thing
[28:23] they ate things sacrificed to idols
[28:27] now i don't say that this really means
[28:28] they were literally eating meat
[28:30] sacrificed to idols
[28:32] for though the council of jerusalem had
[28:33] spoken against such
[28:35] paul did not make much of it as he said
[28:37] the idols were nothing it was just a
[28:39] matter of conscience except where it
[28:41] offended a weaker brother and then it
[28:42] was not allowed
[28:44] furthermore this revelation has to do
[28:46] with gentiles and not jews as these are
[28:49] gentile churches
[28:50] i see this in the same light i see the
[28:52] words of the lord
[28:54] except ye eat my flesh and drink my
[28:56] blood you have no life in you
[28:58] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[29:00] every word that proceeds out of the
[29:02] mouth of god
[29:04] you can see that eating is actually
[29:06] partaking in a spiritual sense
[29:09] so when these people were bowing to the
[29:10] images lighting candles using pagan
[29:12] holidays confessing their sins to men
[29:15] all of which belongs to the devil's
[29:17] religion they were partakers with the
[29:20] devil and not of the lord
[29:22] they were in idolatry whether they
[29:24] admitted it or not
[29:25] they can talk all they want that the
[29:27] altars and the incense are only to
[29:29] remind them of the prayers of the lord
[29:31] or whatever they think it means
[29:33] and they can say that when they pray
[29:35] before the image it is just for the sake
[29:37] of emphasis
[29:38] and that when they confess to the priest
[29:40] it is really to god they are doing it in
[29:42] their hearts
[29:43] and when they say the priest forgives
[29:45] them it is just that he is doing it in
[29:47] the name of the lord
[29:49] they can say what they want but they are
[29:51] partaking in the well-known babylonian
[29:53] satanic religion and have joined
[29:55] themselves to idols and committed
[29:57] spiritual fornication which means death
[30:00] they are dead
[30:02] so the church and the state were married
[30:05] the church joined up with idols
[30:07] with the power of the state behind them
[30:09] they felt that now
[30:10] the kingdom had come and god's will had
[30:13] been enforced upon the earth
[30:15] no wonder the roman catholic church is
[30:17] not looking for the return of the lord
[30:18] jesus
[30:19] they are not millennialists they have
[30:21] their millennium right here
[30:23] the pope is reigning right now and god
[30:25] is reigning in him
[30:27] so when he comes according to them it
[30:29] has to be when the new heavens and the
[30:30] earth are prepared
[30:32] but they are wrong
[30:34] that pope is the head of the false
[30:35] church
[30:36] and there is going to be a millennium
[30:38] but while that is going on he won't be
[30:40] in it he will be somewhere else
[30:44] the warning
[30:46] revelation 2 16
[30:49] repent or else i will come unto thee
[30:51] quickly and will fight against them with
[30:52] the sword of my mouth
[30:54] what else can he say
[30:56] can god overlook the sin of those who
[30:58] have borne his name in vain
[31:00] there is only one way to receive grace
[31:02] in the hour of sin repent
[31:05] confess you are wrong
[31:07] come to god for forgiveness and for the
[31:09] spirit of god
[31:10] this is a command from god to disobey is
[31:14] death for he says
[31:15] i will make war with you with the sword
[31:17] in my mouth
[31:19] the beast made war with the saints but
[31:21] god will make war with the beast
[31:23] those who fought the word will one day
[31:25] find the word fighting them
[31:27] it is a serious thing to take from or
[31:29] add to the word of god for those who
[31:32] changed it and did with it as it suited
[31:34] them what will their end be but death
[31:36] and destruction
[31:38] but still the grace of god cries out
[31:41] repent
[31:42] oh how sweet are the thoughts of
[31:44] repentance
[31:45] nothing in my hands i bring simply to
[31:47] thy cross i cling
[31:49] i bring my sorrow
[31:51] i repent that i am what i am and what i
[31:53] have done
[31:54] now it is the blood nothing but the
[31:56] blood of jesus what will it be
[31:59] repentance or the sword of death
[32:01] it's up to you
[32:05] [Music]
[33:23] you
