[35:14] bless it
[35:16] praise the lord
[35:17] amen
[35:21] amen
[35:27] praise the lord amen let's go to hebrew
[35:30] chapter 12.
[35:35] let's go to hebrew chapter 12.
[35:42] i told you i said when we get down on on
[35:44] some of this rabbit trail
[35:47] it's hard to live from there
[35:50] amen
[35:54] we start looking into
[35:56] uh
[35:58] birthright
[36:00] on sunday
[36:02] and then they took us around esa and
[36:05] jacob
[36:07] and we read the uh
[36:09] the scripture where paul there in romans
[36:14] quoted
[36:17] shake up a love e so i hate
[36:20] and it's it's hard to get off of such a
[36:22] subject
[36:23] so we will we will be doing we will be
[36:25] dealing with that we will want to use
[36:27] tonight and see if the lord
[36:30] will help us to be able to establish
[36:33] uh
[36:34] how how came it there because when the
[36:37] when the angels spoke to rebecca the
[36:39] angel never mentioned anything
[36:42] about jacob i love and esau i hate the
[36:46] injure on the touhou you have two
[36:47] nations in your womb
[36:49] the younger one the older one will save
[36:51] the younger one
[36:53] but then down through the ages uh
[36:56] malachi
[36:57] was the first one that mentioned that
[37:00] jacob i love iso ahead
[37:02] and and in the context that malachi
[37:07] mentioned that he was he was talking
[37:09] about
[37:10] israel
[37:12] questioning his love
[37:16] israel questioning his love it is very
[37:19] very uh interesting when we when we get
[37:22] down to the subject to
[37:24] to uh
[37:25] uh but you will realize that you know
[37:28] there in genesis and then all the way
[37:29] down here in
[37:31] in in malachi we see the prophet malaca
[37:34] bringing it there so it shows that the
[37:36] holy spirit was dealing with that
[37:37] subject as it you know as it progressed
[37:40] so we want to look at hebrew chapter 12
[37:44] tonight so i won't keep you standing i
[37:46] kept you standing all through the time
[37:48] of praying and if you could stand that
[37:51] was that was good
[37:53] and i want to keep you all through the
[37:55] time of preaching
[37:58] praise the lord
[38:00] if you choose to stand and i will say
[38:08] amen
[38:11] let me take
[38:18] let me take uh
[38:21] verse 12
[38:23] just just for the just for the a
[38:26] scripture reading
[38:27] verse 12 hebrew 12 12
[38:30] and uh uh
[38:36] praise the lord
[38:37] verse four wherefore
[38:39] lift up hands which hang down
[38:41] [Music]
[38:42] and the feeble knees
[38:45] and
[38:46] and make straight path
[38:49] for your feet least
[38:50] that which
[38:52] is lame is turn out
[38:55] of the way but let it rather be healed
[38:59] instead of
[39:00] strailing god want us to be healed amen
[39:03] instead of walking contrary to his word
[39:06] he want us walk in the light
[39:08] and more we unfold amen as he's in the
[39:11] light follow peace with all men
[39:15] and holiness
[39:17] without which no man
[39:19] shall see god
[39:22] looking
[39:23] diligently
[39:25] least any man
[39:27] feel of the grace of god
[39:30] leaves any root of bitterness
[39:33] sprinking up trouble you
[39:36] listen to these words
[39:38] as
[39:40] from god not as from me
[39:44] amen
[39:45] looking diligent at least
[39:48] any man
[39:49] fail of the grace of god
[39:52] leaves any root of bitterness sprinking
[39:56] up trouble you
[39:58] and thereby
[40:01] many be defined
[40:05] praise the lord
[40:07] i will come back to them
[40:11] least there be any fornicator
[40:14] or profane person
[40:16] as easter
[40:19] wu for a morsel of meat
[40:22] saw
[40:23] his birthright
[40:26] for you know how that after all
[40:29] when he will have inherited the blessing
[40:33] he was rejected
[40:37] now i taught jacob's toy his blessing
[40:41] praise the lord
[40:43] but this is after calvary
[40:46] when god located through the blood
[40:48] jacob never stole he was rejected
[40:54] you can be you can be stuck in your old
[40:56] testament brain and says jacob's toe is
[40:58] a blessing but when it comes through the
[41:00] blood when god looks at it
[41:03] jacob never stole
[41:05] he was rejected
[41:07] because he was a profane person
[41:12] for you know that after war when he
[41:15] would have inherit inherited the
[41:18] blessing he was rejected
[41:21] for he found no place of repentance
[41:25] he found no place of repentance though
[41:29] he sought it carefully
[41:32] with tears
[41:34] let us pray father
[41:36] please help me tonight

[42:16] oh no it's time of trying many of these
[42:18] things that we read now

[42:57] you can have your seat tonight
[43:01] you know so i was i was looking into
[43:03] this subject
[43:05] of uh
[43:06] uh you know jacob i love israel i hate
[43:11] and and i'm telling you is uh
[43:14] is uh
[43:16] is more than
[43:17] just
[43:20] a verse in the bible
[43:22] it's more than just a verse in the bible
[43:24] so i was i was kind of studying looking
[43:27] out of there tonight
[43:30] and
[43:38] and i got i got in
[43:40] uh there to the office office and you
[43:43] know and just and just tried to
[43:45] to uh just look at some few things
[43:47] before i uh came up here tonight
[43:50] i had a scripture in my mind the root of
[43:53] bitterness
[43:56] so because because i was i was going to
[43:58] deal with with ether tonight
[44:01] and
[44:02] how he got to that place
[44:05] honor
[44:06] what
[44:07] did the holy spirit
[44:11] describe
[44:14] his actions
[44:16] for his to state that god
[44:19] hit easter
[44:21] praise the lord
[44:24] i was i was listening to
[44:30] hello preacher
[44:33] and he was talking about
[44:35] you know there's there's uh
[44:37] there's a preacher that was teaching on
[44:39] this subject
[44:41] and one young man came to him
[44:43] and said
[44:47] i i'm having a serious problem preacher
[44:50] i forget the
[44:52] the brother name
[44:53] now he says i have a serious problem
[44:57] the preacher said yeah what he said
[45:00] he says
[45:01] i can bear the thought of thinking
[45:04] of god
[45:06] hitting the man
[45:08] it troubles me
[45:12] he said well
[45:16] i'm right there with you
[45:18] i have a serious problem too
[45:21] and my problem is
[45:24] i'm trouble with the fact that god can
[45:26] love a man
[45:34] i'm trouble with the fact that god
[45:37] can love
[45:38] a mortal man born in sin shipley in
[45:41] iniquity
[45:45] so you see they were they were both on
[45:47] different side of the fence
[45:51] we were not going to there tonight what
[45:53] i want what i want for us to to deal
[45:55] with
[45:56] is something
[45:58] that uh when you study
[46:00] many
[46:02] uh uh scholars who call it
[46:05] the the everlasting history
[46:09] is uh uh i mean you you talk about
[46:11] everlasting you talk about hatred it
[46:13] kind of troubles your mind but you have
[46:15] to know everlasting is a period of time
[46:18] it means forever and ever but yet it has
[46:20] an end
[46:22] it's different from intended hatred is
[46:24] not intended
[46:26] amen hatred can be everlasting it can be
[46:29] it can be longer than you then you won't
[46:31] want to keep it but uh you know uh it's
[46:34] it's not everlasting
[46:36] so i i was kind of uh looking into that
[46:39] you know studying and uh you know i
[46:41] discovered that many of the scholars
[46:42] look at that
[46:44] and uh
[46:47] we we would just we would just trust
[46:50] tonight
[46:51] and see how the law would help us but i
[46:53] want to go back
[46:54] you know i want to go back to
[46:57] uh
[46:57] a a little
[47:00] time
[47:01] of uh
[47:03] of uh
[47:04] history we want to go back and look look
[47:06] in the life of
[47:08] of easter
[47:10] we we did a little bit with that
[47:13] and and uh
[47:15] so we want to pray that lord will be
[47:17] able to help us tonight praise the lord
[47:19] amen
[47:21] glory be to god
[47:24] so but then when i got in the office
[47:26] just like i was saying i almost lose my
[47:28] thought
[47:29] just like i was saying when i got in the
[47:30] office and i says well i mean this
[47:32] scripture just been hanging on my head
[47:34] since last night i was actually standing
[47:37] on this last night
[47:38] and
[47:39] i mean i came came from
[47:41] from work that the kids were over to the
[47:43] entry place so i just went straight into
[47:46] the room because since sunday i'm
[47:49] telling you
[47:51] the president that was in this building
[47:53] uh i mean was was dealing with me all
[47:56] through the week
[47:57] i just couldn't get away from some
[47:59] things
[48:00] as as tired as my body was but uh
[48:03] uh i it was good and so i went i just
[48:07] went straight into my little my my my my
[48:10] hiding place and i saw that and started
[48:12] looking at this because there was no way
[48:13] i could i could get away from it
[48:16] so
[48:17] but then when i when i
[48:19] try to look at the scripture i says i
[48:21] notice over in the book of hebrews
[48:23] somewhere there and i look it up and
[48:26] then i see
[48:27] how it's connected to to to easter
[48:32] you know how it's connected to esa just
[48:35] just the next verse before the bible
[48:38] paul there talks about easter and his
[48:41] situation let's look at that again god
[48:44] bless you brother d.a
[48:46] go to have brother dda with us amen
[48:49] amen
[48:51] uh some of us will remember him some
[48:53] would not but did he pass here uh was
[48:56] that five years ago
[48:58] five years ago he spent some time with
[49:00] us here then
[49:02] and went over to portland maine where he
[49:04] is now
[49:06] and but we have we have kept in good
[49:09] contact
[49:10] uh
[49:11] uh
[49:12] he's a he's a very very very good friend
[49:15] of mine praise the lord
[49:16] and a good good good friend of mine we
[49:19] we keep in contact
[49:22] and
[49:25] you know he
[49:26] he told me in there
[49:28] he says he says brother won't i choose
[49:30] you to be my pastor i say well okay i'll
[49:32] find somebody to take care of you until
[49:34] you come back
[49:43] praise the lord
[49:44] but he's uh we've been
[49:46] we've been good
[49:49] and he's he's kind of a stuck today he
[49:51] seems to be stubborn with that
[49:53] but
[49:54] the grace of god has has helped us alone
[49:57] amen he's been
[50:00] praise the lord but let's go back to
[50:01] that again uh uh that's that's fine
[50:03] right in
[50:05] verse
[50:07] verse 15.
[50:09] but just just just follow follow follow
[50:12] the way the holy spirit is bringing
[50:14] these things slowly
[50:16] and you know
[50:19] paul from verse 1 started talking about
[50:21] cloud of witnesses he gets down he
[50:24] starts talking about triers and talking
[50:26] about rebuking chastening and he goes
[50:29] down
[50:30] and and then he comes here to this place
[50:33] in in in in the in the scripture where
[50:36] he's talking verse 14 follow peace with
[50:38] all men
[50:40] amen
[50:41] follow peace with all men now uh
[50:44] it's it's almost like we we are in a
[50:47] china because we're dealing with israel
[50:49] now so we are in a china
[50:52] okay the holy spirit is is going to come
[50:55] up here and talk about easter and in his
[50:58] situation but paul
[51:01] uh through the holy spirit now is
[51:03] preparing us for that
[51:06] so he said follow peace with all men
[51:10] and holiness
[51:13] without which no man shall see the lord
[51:18] looking diligently
[51:20] least any man fill
[51:24] of the grace of god
[51:27] praise the lord
[51:31] least any root of bitterness
[51:34] sprinking up trouble you
[51:39] and thereby
[51:41] many
[51:42] be
[51:43] defined
[51:46] praise the lord
[51:49] so
[51:50] bitterness
[51:53] can actually
[51:55] corrupt you
[51:56] to sin
[52:00] bitterness can lead you to fornication
[52:05] it can lead you to adultery
[52:12] praise the lord
[52:15] just hovering bitterness
[52:18] it can lead you
[52:23] to filthiness
[52:26] it can expose you
[52:28] to some of the horrible things
[52:33] the spirit of bitterness
[52:35] can lead you to pornography and all of
[52:37] that
[52:40] it's a terrible thing
[52:49] this enemy root of bitterness
[52:52] spring up
[52:54] sprinkling up trouble you and thereby
[52:57] many be defined
[53:00] at least there be
[53:02] enem fornicator so you see he's he's
[53:05] tying it i'm not just saying these
[53:07] things but i'm trying to put it in in in
[53:11] you know in perspective so you can be
[53:14] able to see how how the holy spirit what
[53:16] the holy spirit is dying paul is not
[53:18] just saying things because he want to
[53:19] say it he's on the an inspiration of the
[53:22] holy spirit at least there be any
[53:25] fornicator or profane person
[53:32] praise the lord
[53:34] but he start up to say follow peace
[53:37] strive to be peaceful with all men
[53:43] and all that you can do strive to be
[53:45] peaceful jesus says when he hits you on
[53:48] this cheek turn the other one
[53:50] praise the lord
[53:54] it is easy for you to just turn around
[53:56] and get away from there then for you to
[53:58] turn the other one for them to slap you
[54:00] you know you won't do that
[54:03] so it's easy to just turn the other way
[54:05] and go
[54:14] strive for the for the spirit of peace
[54:17] with all men
[54:18] holiness
[54:21] he says least there be any fornicator or
[54:23] profane person as easter
[54:27] as easter you go back to the third of of
[54:30] genesis
[54:32] i mean isa was not even married at that
[54:34] time
[54:36] he was not married he said that paul is
[54:38] saying that israel was living in
[54:40] fornication no
[54:42] that's not what paul is saying
[54:47] paul is bringing us to the place to
[54:49] realize that something contaminated the
[54:53] spirit
[54:54] of israel
[54:55] and that thing was bitterness
[55:03] bitterness contaminated the spirit and
[55:06] then and then paul now he's helping us
[55:10] the same one that said we have cloud of
[55:12] witnesses around us which means being a
[55:15] prophet he could look beyond the mortal
[55:17] reign
[55:19] now he's helping us tonight for us to be
[55:22] able to see how god look at the spirit
[55:25] of bitterness
[55:32] you might have never uh uh uh have
[55:36] fornication or live wrong or or you know
[55:39] go into any kind of a sexual life but if
[55:42] you have the spirit of bitterness in you
[55:46] it's almost like brother branham says he
[55:48] says the spirit of organization he said
[55:51] the same spirit that will bring people
[55:54] to organize he says is the same spirit
[55:56] that will make a man a young man to live
[55:59] in fornication and a married man to live
[56:02] in adultery
[56:04] they are prophets
[56:07] prophets deal with spirits
[56:11] prophets live most of their life in a
[56:14] spirit realm
[56:16] than in the natural realm
[56:21] are we together
[56:26] have your way tonight lord
[56:30] least there be any fornicator or profane
[56:32] person as easier
[56:37] who fought a morsel of meat
[56:41] saw his breath right
[56:42] for a muscle of meat
[56:47] why is the holy spirit tying that act of
[56:52] a man that is hungry
[56:58] praise the lord
[57:00] why is the holy spirit tying that
[57:04] to a profane person
[57:09] why is the holy spirit tying that to
[57:11] unclean living
[57:14] because the the the spirit that was on
[57:17] him
[57:18] is the same spirit that put young people
[57:20] in the street to do prostitution
[57:23] just for little or no money
[57:29] it's the same spirit that will makes a
[57:31] man to break the word of god
[57:35] just
[57:36] for
[57:37] a little sense of pleasure
[57:41] so you see
[57:44] this thing runs deep
[57:50] it runs deep
[57:52] and we will pray that the lord will be
[57:53] able to help us but what i want to deal
[57:55] with here tonight
[57:57] uh like i said
[57:59] if if we go back we want to look at a
[58:02] little bit of history tonight if the law
[58:05] will help us
[58:06] and then uh
[58:09] whatever you know the grace of god
[58:12] will be able to
[58:14] to uh lead us we will go from there
[58:17] so
[58:19] as we look at this we'll realize the
[58:22] other
[58:26] as paul has set
[58:30] this place for us
[58:32] he's helping us to see that
[58:45] easter
[58:54] god bitterness in him
[58:58] he got bitterness in him have i'm having
[59:00] a lot of scriptures before me i'm trying
[59:02] to
[59:02] just collect myself together
[59:08] now but if we go back a little bit
[59:11] if we go back if we want to do justice
[59:13] today so go back and look at
[59:16] easter because what we would drive to
[59:18] here is that
[59:22] uh the scripture right there in genesis
[59:24] chapter 25
[59:27] when it talks about
[59:29] easter
[59:30] taking the polish the bible says and
[59:33] there his name was called edom
[59:38] and then down in the in the in the
[59:40] scripture
[59:41] you realize there was a people called
[59:44] the
[59:47] and those
[59:50] came from easter
[59:52] right
[59:53] praise the lord
[59:55] but let's go back to father abraham
[59:59] abraham actually had three women in his
[1:00:02] life
[1:00:05] one was sarah
[1:00:09] the mother of isaac
[1:00:10] the son of the promise
[1:00:13] praise the lord
[1:00:15] the second woman was heger
[1:00:19] she's the mother of ishmael
[1:00:22] praise the lord
[1:00:24] and then when sarah died
[1:00:26] abraham mary keturah
[1:00:30] and keturah had
[1:00:32] six sons
[1:00:36] praise the lord
[1:00:38] now so we have we have isaac we have
[1:00:41] ishmael
[1:00:42] we have the sixth sons of keturah
[1:00:50] but you'll realize here
[1:00:53] out of isaac
[1:00:55] came ether and jacob
[1:00:59] okay
[1:01:02] out of ishmael came
[1:01:04] the ishmael actually had he had 12 sons
[1:01:09] and uh came
[1:01:12] the ishmaelites
[1:01:15] and then out of the six sons of keturah
[1:01:21] came the arabians
[1:01:25] where we presently have today saudi
[1:01:27] arabia
[1:01:30] praise the lord
[1:01:34] every nation
[1:01:38] in modern history that now
[1:01:41] endured around israel
[1:01:43] came from these sons
[1:01:47] of ishmael
[1:01:49] and the sons of keturah
[1:01:52] praise the lord
[1:01:59] so
[1:02:04] then in genesis 25
[1:02:06] verse 30 that was where
[1:02:09] the uh the first time that uh edom was
[1:02:11] used from jacob
[1:02:15] because of the rareness of the soup
[1:02:18] so there in the scripture you you
[1:02:21] realize that
[1:02:23] uh the land of seer
[1:02:25] s e i arrow
[1:02:26] and edom they always have you know
[1:02:30] relations
[1:02:32] okay
[1:02:33] and i'm just i'm trying to to lay out
[1:02:36] some things here so
[1:02:37] uh uh i mean we we can be able to
[1:02:40] establish our tasks together
[1:02:43] now
[1:02:46] uh
[1:02:47] in genesis
[1:02:48] chapter 28
[1:02:51] verse 9 if we look there
[1:02:55] in genesis
[1:02:59] chapter 28
[1:03:13] i'm kind of struggling a little bit to
[1:03:15] stick to my mind my notes here or as
[1:03:19] i'll be all over the place
[1:03:22] verse nine then went easter to ishmael
[1:03:25] and took
[1:03:26] and talked onto
[1:03:29] and took on to the wives
[1:03:31] which he hired
[1:03:34] mahala the daughter of ishmael abraham's
[1:03:37] son
[1:03:38] the sister
[1:03:40] of
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:43] if i pronounce it right or wrong
[1:03:46] to be wife
[1:03:47] but where is this stop going
[1:03:50] ishmael
[1:03:52] i mean easter
[1:03:53] is now going to emerge with the with the
[1:03:56] uh ishmael nights
[1:04:00] and
[1:04:01] and pretty soon as as we will look
[1:04:03] through the scripture
[1:04:05] because the the wonderful thing about it
[1:04:07] there is that
[1:04:09] the word
[1:04:11] that this bible recorded all the nations
[1:04:13] that is recorded in the bible state
[1:04:15] exists
[1:04:17] it's just that with history and walls
[1:04:20] their name did change
[1:04:25] you know as children you read the bible
[1:04:27] and you read about this nation it looks
[1:04:28] like it was a word that existed before
[1:04:31] and that word did god destroy is the
[1:04:34] very same word that we are living in
[1:04:35] today
[1:04:38] amen
[1:04:43] now so uh uh
[1:04:46] as as we look at this we're going to see
[1:04:50] that
[1:04:51] easter
[1:04:52] out of bitterness
[1:04:55] he called mega himself
[1:04:58] with
[1:05:01] the ishmaelites
[1:05:04] and pretty soon
[1:05:06] they were all
[1:05:08] co-mingle together that's the reason why
[1:05:11] now
[1:05:12] people from that region are all called
[1:05:15] arabs
[1:05:16] but biblically they are now all arabs
[1:05:20] among them they are the
[1:05:22] they are the the the the they
[1:05:25] are the the ishmaelites and they are the
[1:05:28] arabs
[1:05:32] praise the lord
[1:05:33] but because they have cold meager
[1:05:39] as we look through the scripture
[1:05:42] and uh i i bring some other things to
[1:05:45] you from from the prophet but that nat
[1:05:47] nat i want to just kind of
[1:05:50] uh
[1:05:51] do it on on history yet a little bit so
[1:05:54] we realized that uh
[1:05:56] uh
[1:05:57] edom
[1:06:00] is to the southeast of the dead sea
[1:06:06] and
[1:06:08] yeah the southeast of the dead sea
[1:06:11] and right there
[1:06:13] we realized the other
[1:06:15] uh
[1:06:23] it is stand to the both side of
[1:06:26] the
[1:06:28] uh
[1:06:29] the arabians
[1:06:31] and
[1:06:32] it connects itself to the dead and the
[1:06:34] red sea so all that area that's where
[1:06:37] you find this group of people but they
[1:06:40] they all call me together
[1:06:43] now because what you were you from all
[1:06:46] of these you will now understand
[1:06:50] the lasting history
[1:06:53] of all the nations around israel
[1:06:57] while they hit israel
[1:07:04] are we together
[1:07:06] because what we're trying to to
[1:07:09] deal with here is
[1:07:11] the bitterness of easter give birth
[1:07:15] to the history and the wall in palestine
[1:07:21] praise the lord
[1:07:23] amen
[1:07:24] and as we travel together you will
[1:07:26] realize that this would take us to
[1:07:29] god and my god
[1:07:37] that's what
[1:07:39] bitterness will do
[1:07:41] but let me let me share something with
[1:07:43] you i was i was talking i was talking to
[1:07:46] uh
[1:07:47] to some young people
[1:07:49] and uh and and
[1:07:51] and the holy spirit just helped me
[1:07:53] say this thing and i left from there
[1:07:54] being blessed i don't know if they were
[1:07:56] blessed but i left from there being
[1:07:57] blessed
[1:07:57] [Laughter]
[1:08:00] praise the lord
[1:08:02] you see in the scripture
[1:08:07] joseph
[1:08:08] his brother
[1:08:10] hated him
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:13] his brother
[1:08:15] saw him
[1:08:17] to the egyptians
[1:08:20] but you see the way joseph dead
[1:08:24] with what his brother
[1:08:26] did
[1:08:28] he never allowed
[1:08:31] bitterness
[1:08:32] to enter his heart
[1:08:34] and because he did not have bitterness
[1:08:37] there was no room to revenge
[1:08:40] what makes a person to revenge is
[1:08:43] bitterness
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:48] are we together
[1:08:51] yes joseph here
[1:08:53] for no reason he can't even understand
[1:08:56] it
[1:08:56] at first he thought his brothers were
[1:08:58] joking they put him down down the hall
[1:09:01] and then he's uh he's help me help me
[1:09:05] nobody is coming stinky okay
[1:09:08] i don't know what i've done i'm sorry
[1:09:10] whatever i've done i'm sorry
[1:09:13] in his mind he's thinking that they
[1:09:15] would get over it
[1:09:17] and it would come and take me out
[1:09:21] praise the lord
[1:09:23] and he's standing right there his
[1:09:26] brother's standing there and he see them
[1:09:28] taking money from these uh from these uh
[1:09:31] uh meetings or whoever group they are
[1:09:34] taking money from them
[1:09:36] and the man carrying him he's looking at
[1:09:38] his brothers
[1:09:45] samia help he's looking at his brothers
[1:09:50] and they put him on the wagon and he's
[1:09:53] he's looking behind
[1:09:55] and his brothers are fading from his
[1:09:57] eyes
[1:09:58] as the chair keeps going
[1:10:01] he cried and he cried and he cried
[1:10:07] he couldn't understand why they did it
[1:10:09] to him so he never put no meaning
[1:10:14] the thing that makes you to keep things
[1:10:16] is because you put meaning to it
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:22] i don't understand why they did this to
[1:10:23] me if you don't understand it leave it
[1:10:30] i don't understand why they don't like
[1:10:31] me but i think
[1:10:35] you already have a reason why they don't
[1:10:37] like you
[1:10:41] you already establish a reason why they
[1:10:43] don't like you
[1:10:47] maybe it's because maybe it's because
[1:10:51] and as you settle down with that thought
[1:10:54] in your mind
[1:10:59] then you start to plot with that thought
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:04] you start mixing your own person
[1:11:09] you start mixing it in your mind and you
[1:11:11] mixing and you start cooking it together
[1:11:14] the very thing that is going to kill you
[1:11:21] when i get back i'm going to show myself
[1:11:23] to them i don't even care about them and
[1:11:25] then you go on and you go on you're just
[1:11:28] cooking that thing
[1:11:29] in yourself
[1:11:31] i will show them
[1:11:32] they think i'm stupid and you just keep
[1:11:35] cooking it
[1:11:37] praise the lord if you were cooking it
[1:11:39] in somebody's heart it would be better
[1:11:40] you cooking it in your own heart
[1:11:49] and jacob joseph went away and he kept
[1:11:52] thinking about it
[1:11:54] wow
[1:11:56] why they did this
[1:12:00] oh man
[1:12:04] and he cried and he cried he missed his
[1:12:07] father he missed his brothers
[1:12:10] he still missed him
[1:12:12] sure
[1:12:16] he still missed him
[1:12:23] and because he could not make sense of
[1:12:27] why they hated him
[1:12:31] there was no way for him to establish
[1:12:34] revenge in his heart
[1:12:39] oh he was hoping that one day he would
[1:12:42] see them
[1:12:45] one day he would go back in and see them
[1:12:48] maybe
[1:12:49] i mean i said young man i was sitting i
[1:12:51] was asking why you had to treat me like
[1:12:52] that
[1:12:54] why you did this to me
[1:12:56] the y was just there
[1:12:58] sure
[1:13:00] praise the lord
[1:13:02] but as as he went on and as he grew
[1:13:06] and as the lord was dealing with him
[1:13:09] instead of the brothers giving him an
[1:13:12] answer god gave him an answer right
[1:13:15] yes
[1:13:16] he said you meant it for evil
[1:13:19] but the lord turned it out to be good
[1:13:21] [Laughter]
[1:13:28] oh
[1:13:28] man
[1:13:30] praise the lord amen
[1:13:35] but then it's a complete opposite
[1:13:38] this is easy that came to his brother
[1:13:40] and he said look i'm dying give me this
[1:13:43] food yep i mean it is breath right you
[1:13:47] can have it if that's all you want
[1:13:52] praise the lord
[1:13:58] but then when he came back
[1:14:00] going to make the search for his father
[1:14:02] when he came back in in in and realized
[1:14:06] that
[1:14:07] his dad has blessed easter
[1:14:10] i mean has blessed jacob
[1:14:12] yeah my goodness he says
[1:14:15] you took my breath right and you took my
[1:14:18] blessing again i would kill this boy
[1:14:28] and you see what happened is that he got
[1:14:31] so mad
[1:14:33] so angry
[1:14:36] what brother balaam says anger is nesto
[1:14:39] insanity when you get angry you lose
[1:14:41] your mind
[1:14:45] he got so angry
[1:14:47] until he turned the anger against his
[1:14:50] own parents
[1:14:52] that he would not listen to the advice
[1:14:54] they shouldn't tell him where to get
[1:14:56] married and who to get marital
[1:15:00] you see the parents never did anything
[1:15:02] to him
[1:15:03] right
[1:15:05] but you see their anger
[1:15:07] and that bitterness
[1:15:10] make him now to be
[1:15:12] more off a white man he can turn it on
[1:15:14] anybody
[1:15:17] praise the lord
[1:15:20] have you ever experienced that
[1:15:24] just coming from in a in a rough talk
[1:15:27] you're not happy
[1:15:28] and someone say hi
[1:15:30] yeah hi
[1:15:33] what did that person do innocent person
[1:15:38] it's because your spirit is is cooking
[1:15:41] in that anger
[1:15:44] there's no way to put up a smile
[1:15:48] what's happening nothing
[1:15:58] praise the lord
[1:16:00] so he turned the anger on his parents he
[1:16:02] would not listen to them he was he was
[1:16:05] he was you know
[1:16:08] very mad
[1:16:14] he decided to travel down
[1:16:20] go down to
[1:16:21] the ishmaelites and get his wife live
[1:16:24] any way he want
[1:16:27] he really now became
[1:16:29] a wild man
[1:16:33] but problem there is that he was dealing
[1:16:36] with bitterness
[1:16:38] and with that bitterness in his heart
[1:16:41] there were a lot of profane things that
[1:16:43] came to his mind
[1:16:45] when i grabbed that boy i would kill him
[1:16:47] i would kill his children i would kill
[1:16:49] his wife he wouldn't have a grave i mean
[1:16:52] over and over every night he slept with
[1:16:55] that thing
[1:16:57] in his mind
[1:17:01] every night he came out with a new plan
[1:17:09] praise the lord
[1:17:11] he never only had a root of bitterness
[1:17:13] he had a tree
[1:17:18] because it brought forth a nation called
[1:17:20] edom that hated israel
[1:17:27] it affected other nations
[1:17:32] until today till because the day is
[1:17:34] almost almost until tomorrow is still
[1:17:36] putting our fruits
[1:17:45] are we together
[1:17:48] now pretty soon you will soon learn to
[1:17:50] start understanding
[1:17:53] what god hate
[1:17:54] what was it
[1:17:56] that god
[1:17:57] hate
[1:18:07] are we together
[1:18:10] praise the lord
[1:18:12] now so we realize here
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:24] so as as uh
[1:18:27] as the nations went by
[1:18:29] let's look a few scriptures tonight
[1:18:32] like i said i'm trying to lay the
[1:18:34] foundation here
[1:18:43] you realize in numbers chapter 20
[1:18:48] in numbers chapter 20 uh maybe you can
[1:18:50] write them down
[1:18:52] uh edom refused israel's passage
[1:18:56] when they were on the adjoining
[1:19:00] refuse
[1:19:02] you see
[1:19:04] many years back i remember preaching a
[1:19:06] message called generation conflict
[1:19:10] and i took that message from the
[1:19:12] statement that a woman that aware made
[1:19:15] when she said
[1:19:19] our father told us
[1:19:23] praise the lord
[1:19:26] our fathers taught us
[1:19:29] things that was that i said from the
[1:19:31] parents to the children
[1:19:33] sometimes it takes the parents conflict
[1:19:37] down
[1:19:41] and the next generation passed that
[1:19:43] conflict
[1:19:44] down to the next generation
[1:19:46] those people that were mean to our
[1:19:48] father
[1:19:51] and just that one word would breed
[1:19:54] rebellion in the children against those
[1:19:56] people
[1:20:01] even refused passage to israel is there
[1:20:04] in numbers chapter
[1:20:06] 20.
[1:20:12] but yet over in deuteronomy chapter 23
[1:20:17] god
[1:20:18] forbid israel
[1:20:21] to i help edom and god says they are
[1:20:23] your brothers
[1:20:30] praise the lord
[1:20:33] in numbers chapter 24 balaam
[1:20:36] he predicted
[1:20:38] that edom
[1:20:39] will be conquered
[1:20:50] in joshua
[1:20:52] chapter 15 god
[1:20:55] told joshua
[1:20:57] that he must not encroach on the land of
[1:21:02] the
[1:21:07] now see see this thing so you realize
[1:21:10] here that god
[1:21:11] is dealing with this thing in a
[1:21:13] completely different way
[1:21:16] if you just take it in a kind of
[1:21:18] knowledge of god hit easter you're going
[1:21:21] to get you you will get the whole
[1:21:23] picture wrong
[1:21:26] praise the lord amen
[1:21:29] because just like i said there is
[1:21:31] nowhere there in genesis chapter 25 that
[1:21:34] the angel told rebecca anything about
[1:21:36] god hitting easter
[1:21:41] sure
[1:21:45] and here we said all down here god is
[1:21:48] still protecting those people telling
[1:21:50] joshua don't even crush upon their land
[1:21:52] they are your brothers
[1:21:54] but yet edom is now being the brother to
[1:21:58] israel
[1:22:01] they are finding ways after wins
[1:22:04] to still fight against israel
[1:22:10] second chronicle chapter 20 the
[1:22:12] joined the moabites and it read against
[1:22:15] judah
[1:22:20] and you can go on and on and on and on
[1:22:26] it will surprise you when you study to
[1:22:28] realize that
[1:22:32] herald the king
[1:22:36] that all of the babies
[1:22:38] to be killed
[1:22:39] that he was an edomite
[1:22:44] herald the king because it was another
[1:22:46] hero
[1:22:47] that ordered the head of john the
[1:22:49] baptist
[1:22:50] to be cut off
[1:22:52] he was an edomite
[1:22:58] praise the lord
[1:23:05] and if you are you said it also
[1:23:10] herald the king
[1:23:12] honorables jesus was crucified
[1:23:15] he was also an evil might
[1:23:21] you see that's the reason why in the
[1:23:22] scripture
[1:23:24] talking about herald you remember how
[1:23:26] jesus distraught him go tell that fox
[1:23:42] so you see there's there is there is a
[1:23:45] lot of things
[1:23:50] that uh you know that that
[1:23:55] there is a lot of things that constitute
[1:23:58] all
[1:23:59] to this scripture
[1:24:00] to that verse i don't want to i don't
[1:24:03] want to pass my page but
[1:24:05] uh
[1:24:06] you know
[1:24:11] just to see
[1:24:13] that
[1:24:16] it was his own fault
[1:24:20] praise the lord
[1:24:23] amen
[1:24:25] you know
[1:24:26] it is not just for the fact that
[1:24:29] that uh
[1:24:30] uh
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:33] uh
[1:24:34] isa was hungry
[1:24:37] it is it is it is the fact that the
[1:24:40] thought that runs with that
[1:24:42] is the idea of a person that feels that
[1:24:45] they can get whatever they want
[1:24:49] when they want it
[1:24:55] how the one whatever the one that can
[1:24:57] get it
[1:24:59] he wanted he wanted the food he could
[1:25:01] get it
[1:25:04] that kind of for that kind of attitude
[1:25:06] when a person feels that they can get
[1:25:09] whatever they want however they want it
[1:25:11] they can get it
[1:25:13] it's all of those things
[1:25:15] that comes to it
[1:25:17] and that is a prosperity
[1:25:21] as we'll soon discover
[1:25:22] it's all tied to it
[1:25:26] praise the lord
[1:25:28] but tonight for this prayer meeting
[1:25:31] as we have poured our house before god
[1:25:33] thanking god
[1:25:35] we want to use this time and endure on
[1:25:38] bitterness
[1:25:41] that became
[1:25:42] the soul problem
[1:25:44] of edom
[1:25:46] hovering
[1:25:50] unforgiving spirit
[1:25:53] became the sole problem
[1:25:58] of essa
[1:26:00] oh may god search us tonight
[1:26:04] praise the lord
[1:26:06] may god search us tonight
[1:26:08] you realize that most of our spiritual
[1:26:11] struggle
[1:26:12] is because we are stuck somewhere
[1:26:16] in our spirit man
[1:26:24] follow peace with all men
[1:26:28] and that peace
[1:26:30] will bring you holiness unto god
[1:26:37] you want the holy ghost follow peace
[1:26:38] with all me
[1:26:47] that was the root cause
[1:26:53] of isa problem
[1:26:58] the bible says he despised the breath
[1:27:00] right
[1:27:02] he care less about it
[1:27:05] but yeah when he realized that his
[1:27:07] brother talked to birthright he was not
[1:27:09] happy it was not like he did not care
[1:27:12] about it in a sense the other he never
[1:27:14] wanted it does not mean anything to him
[1:27:18] but it's just that attitude
[1:27:22] of thinking that i can get whatever i
[1:27:25] want
[1:27:27] any way i want it
[1:27:30] praise the lord
[1:27:33] that you can even disperse your health
[1:27:36] you can despise
[1:27:38] time you can despise god you can just
[1:27:40] because whatever you want you set your
[1:27:42] mind on it i can get it it is that kind
[1:27:44] of a spirit kind of a driving spirit
[1:27:47] that was in easter
[1:27:49] and nobody can tell me anything
[1:27:51] different
[1:27:53] sure
[1:28:07] oh my god be merciful
[1:28:14] and may he help us
[1:28:17] praise the lord
[1:28:23] in rebellion
[1:28:26] he called maker himself
[1:28:32] praise the lord
[1:28:35] yes
[1:28:38] if you even read the scripture you will
[1:28:40] see how yeah i mean even his parents
[1:28:43] mother tried to talk to him is there no
[1:28:45] other women somewhere i mean he didn't
[1:28:47] care it was not his problem
[1:28:50] that thing was eating him up
[1:28:54] he was trying to gain forces
[1:28:58] that when he's a return
[1:29:02] i would pay back
[1:29:07] praise the lord
[1:29:10] but you realize with joseph
[1:29:13] all the things that he was doing
[1:29:15] from from the fact that he identified
[1:29:17] his brothers everything that he was
[1:29:20] doing to them
[1:29:21] was to hide his identity he was not
[1:29:24] doing it to them in revenge
[1:29:29] because he was he was just at the edge
[1:29:32] to reveal himself he was shaking
[1:29:35] he knew that this was these guys were
[1:29:38] his blood
[1:29:39] right
[1:29:42] least the least mistake he made he knows
[1:29:44] that they will realize there is
[1:29:46] something different about this man
[1:29:48] so he kept doing things just to hide his
[1:29:51] identity right but there was now one
[1:29:54] root of bitterness
[1:29:58] in him
[1:30:00] because of how he did with the rejection
[1:30:10] he said you meant it for evil
[1:30:13] but god turn it out for god
[1:30:18] praise the lord
[1:30:22] when he came back the next time just
[1:30:23] like the scripture we read on sunday he
[1:30:25] brought them on the table they sat down
[1:30:28] he gave them the best place to sleep
[1:30:34] when he even had one of his brothers
[1:30:37] so they can go and bring uh benjamin
[1:30:39] back
[1:30:41] when they all came back and that brother
[1:30:43] starts to tell them gentlemen i really
[1:30:45] enjoy my state
[1:30:49] if the hard present is i really want to
[1:30:51] be in prison people were feeling me in
[1:30:53] the morning they brought clothes for me
[1:30:55] to word
[1:30:58] i'm in the air-conditioned room oh my
[1:31:00] goodness egyptian praising is that
[1:31:02] really where prison is
[1:31:04] i mean before they came back this god
[1:31:06] cheek was sticking out
[1:31:12] praise the lord
[1:31:14] so you can see there was there was now
[1:31:16] one root of bitterness jacob joseph was
[1:31:20] just doing all of those things just to
[1:31:22] hide his identity
[1:31:24] waiting for benjamin
[1:31:26] waiting for little benjamin to appear
[1:31:28] before he can show himself
[1:31:32] praise the lord
[1:31:36] when he saw little benjamin that she had
[1:31:38] the same wound with him
[1:31:40] he could not hold himself the bible said
[1:31:42] he went behind the curtain and he cried
[1:31:48] he never cried out of vestation or out
[1:31:51] of anger
[1:31:53] it was a tear of joy
[1:31:56] because in his mind he says oh my
[1:31:58] brothers lord thank you you kept them
[1:32:00] safe
[1:32:02] is your father still alive
[1:32:12] the lord
[1:32:13] and because
[1:32:14] he did with that matter
[1:32:17] god bless him
[1:32:20] because he gathered his heart
[1:32:24] that no
[1:32:25] root of bitterness would enter
[1:32:28] god protected him
[1:32:39] he was not raising money so he can bring
[1:32:41] an army and goes kill those men and
[1:32:43] their children
[1:32:45] right
[1:33:00] search me oh god
[1:33:03] in all my heart today
[1:33:09] praise the lord
[1:33:11] search me oh god
[1:33:13] and all my heart today
[1:33:15] i'll say something tonight
[1:33:19] oh god be merciful
[1:33:21] praise the lord
[1:33:36] just help us lord
[1:33:41] just help us
[1:33:44] what a girl we serve
[1:33:46] his ways our paths finding out
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:51] god's ways
[1:33:53] are past finding out
[1:34:00] that's the reason why the scripture says
[1:34:02] he searched
[1:34:03] the range
[1:34:05] and the heart
[1:34:09] he's looking in your heart
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:15] he's all caring about how
[1:34:17] you are dealing with your situation
[1:34:20] in your heart
[1:34:28] what a god we self
[1:34:31] praise the lord
[1:34:33] are we together tonight
[1:34:35] amen
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:44] oh praise the lord jesus thank you
[1:34:46] father
[1:34:48] thank you lord
[1:34:52] i'll look in at a scripture
[1:34:54] this uh
[1:34:57] yesterday evening i might share that
[1:34:59] with you on sunday
[1:35:01] and
[1:35:02] jeremiah deals with that
[1:35:04] jeremiah called out seven nations
[1:35:08] in the book of jeremiah
[1:35:11] and all of those nations that jeremiah
[1:35:13] called out
[1:35:14] the uh
[1:35:16] state presence nations that are all
[1:35:18] around israel
[1:35:20] and god
[1:35:22] mentioned them one by one that he was
[1:35:24] going to deal with him
[1:35:27] and mention what they did to
[1:35:29] to israel
[1:35:34] god remember
[1:35:37] they are wrong the the uh the
[1:35:39] hatred towards israel
[1:35:43] praise the lord
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:47] as we stand together
[1:35:50] you will realize
[1:35:53] that
[1:35:56] we all know that that god is the great
[1:35:59] fountain of love
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:02] and actually there is no hate in god
[1:36:07] praise the lord
[1:36:09] as also
[1:36:11] he's the great
[1:36:13] holy god
[1:36:16] there is no evil in him
[1:36:19] but yet the scripture says an evil
[1:36:21] spirit from the lord
[1:36:24] when and anoint
[1:36:25] those prophets
[1:36:28] they have prophets
[1:36:39] solomon said this
[1:36:45] in proverbs chapter four
[1:36:53] verse 23 keep the heart with all
[1:36:55] diligence
[1:36:58] for out of it
[1:36:59] are the issues
[1:37:01] of life
[1:37:03] whatever you keep in your heart we live
[1:37:07] because your heart like brother branham
[1:37:09] said
[1:37:10] in spoken word is the original seed he
[1:37:13] said the heart is a womb
[1:37:19] it's a womb
[1:37:21] just like how a child lives in the womb
[1:37:25] that's how whatever you keep in your
[1:37:27] heart
[1:37:28] we live
[1:37:36] praise the lord
[1:37:41] and if you don't mind whatever you keep
[1:37:43] in your heart
[1:37:44] my life longer than you
[1:37:50] praise the lord
[1:37:51] am i live longer than you
[1:37:55] depending on what it is it might even
[1:37:57] have to kill you and live
[1:38:00] on because it's a spirit
