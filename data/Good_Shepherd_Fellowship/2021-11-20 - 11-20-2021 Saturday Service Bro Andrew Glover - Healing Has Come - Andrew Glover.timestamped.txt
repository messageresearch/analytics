[46:01] pretty frail
[46:02] and
[46:04] she
[46:05] looks pale she
[46:07] she's getting weak
[46:09] of course she's 90 years old
[46:11] and
[46:14] my sister just
[46:15] kind of called me and
[46:18] the day before and asked
[46:21] prayer from
[46:24] my brothers and sisters in the church
[46:27] um
[46:29] i guess on
[46:31] wednesday night
[46:33] if not mistaken or thursday
[46:35] um
[46:37] i got a text from my sister
[46:40] my uh
[46:42] sister said that
[46:44] she
[46:45] was telling her
[46:47] thank you for everything
[46:49] forgive me
[46:50] and asking forgiveness
[46:53] and that she knew she was ready to go
[46:58] but as she went to bed
[47:01] i supposedly my sister was just saying
[47:04] oh mom you know
[47:06] she got up the next morning
[47:09] and
[47:10] she said she was sent back
[47:13] she said she saw two
[47:16] beans
[47:17] and they were just talking to one
[47:19] another and they said no
[47:22] jesus is sending you back
[47:24] she actually
[47:26] went
[47:28] and she
[47:30] the lord sent her back
[47:33] yesterday i had a conversation with
[47:36] brother juan i called him to tell him
[47:39] about these things and talk to him for a
[47:41] little while
[47:42] well the brother was sharing a testimony
[47:44] that he had from one of you one of his
[47:47] cousins i think
[47:48] there was a lady
[47:50] back that passed away
[47:53] and she came back to life
[47:57] but she came back according to what
[48:00] brother one was telling me once was
[48:02] because she got
[48:04] her hair cut and they send her back
[48:08] well
[48:09] my brother
[48:10] my brother he didn't know
[48:12] when she said that to me i said my
[48:15] goodness
[48:16] you don't know what you're saying
[48:17] brother
[48:18] my goodness i don't know why you're
[48:20] telling me this
[48:23] sunday
[48:25] my mother usually wears
[48:28] a braid and her hair she's always kept
[48:30] her hair
[48:32] down to her waist
[48:36] she asked my sister to cut her hair
[48:40] here's the brother telling me this story
[48:45] my sister cut her hair to the to her
[48:47] shoulders
[48:49] and on and on
[48:51] thursday when she
[48:54] by god's grace
[48:56] she's telling my sister
[48:59] thank you for everything
[49:01] you know it's time for me to go
[49:04] you know i ask forgiveness so you all
[49:07] tell tell your brothers and sisters
[49:10] that it's time for me to go
[49:15] thursday morning
[49:16] she wakes up and she says
[49:19] they sent me back
[49:22] so
[49:23] i believe that god is giving her an
[49:25] opportunity
[49:27] to
[49:27] take the name of jesus i of course i
[49:30] asked my brother and i asked the lord
[49:32] that
[49:33] that
[49:34] she would not cross over the other side
[49:38] without receiving the lord jesus in our
[49:40] heart and that's my desire brothers and
[49:42] sisters that's my desire
[49:45] that she accept him
[49:47] because when she leaves she will meet
[49:49] him over there on the other side so
[49:52] that's my witness just to
[49:54] show you how
[49:56] how god and his grace and his love
[50:00] to give give her a chance
[50:03] to come back
[50:07] to receive him in in her heart so thank
[50:10] you for the opportunity to express this
[50:12] to you thank you for your prayer i
[50:14] admonish your prayers i appreciate every
[50:17] prayer you say not only for my mom
[50:20] but for somebody else
[50:22] so i thank you for that and that's in
[50:25] the name of the lord jesus christ
[50:33] praise the lord amen
[50:35] amen everyone called me and we were
[50:38] talking he was sharing
[50:40] uh you know with uh
[50:42] that testimony of his mom
[50:45] and then uh
[50:47] i just failed to encourage him and and
[50:50] you know and share this and share that
[50:52] with him it actually was my aunt
[50:54] my dad senior sister
[50:57] she remembered that as a child
[50:59] she was
[51:01] a devote catholic lady
[51:04] but from from a child and this this
[51:07] might have happened back in the 1940s
[51:09] 1930s 1940s and as a child
[51:13] back home a lady passed away
[51:16] and then
[51:18] you know it's in the village they don't
[51:19] have much water to keep the body so they
[51:21] prepared dr grave everything and then
[51:24] suddenly the woman walked her back and
[51:26] says
[51:27] i was sent back because i caught my head
[51:30] you know so
[51:32] my aunt
[51:33] from a little child
[51:35] refuse
[51:37] for her hair to be cut
[51:40] she will always say you know when she
[51:42] get older
[51:44] she actually had dementia you know there
[51:46] are times she will not even remember the
[51:48] people behind her but when you ask her
[51:51] that story about her hair
[51:53] she will always tell you

[1:07:49] after the baptism which john preached
[1:07:53] how god anointed jesus of nazareth with
[1:07:56] the holy ghost and with power
[1:07:58] amen i'm glad to announce to you tonight
[1:08:01] that the ministry of the holy ghost has
[1:08:03] returned to the church of the living god
[1:08:06] how god anointed jesus of nazareth with
[1:08:08] the holy ghost and with power who went
[1:08:11] about doing good notice this
[1:08:13] and healing all that were oppressed of
[1:08:16] the devil
[1:08:18] for god was with him
[1:08:20] and then we ask the lord this evening to
[1:08:22] add the blessing to the reading of his
[1:08:23] word
[1:08:24] as you can have your seats here this
[1:08:25] afternoon uh from those scriptures for
[1:08:28] just a few moments here if the lord
[1:08:30] would help me i want to speak to you
[1:08:32] here on a thought if i'm a talent
[1:08:33] tonight i want to speak to you on the
[1:08:35] healing has come to the oppressed
[1:08:39] healing has come to the oppressed i am
[1:08:42] thankful tonight to know that god is a
[1:08:45] healer amen i was listening to a take
[1:08:47] the other day in the message go wake
[1:08:49] jesus brother says but there is more to
[1:08:52] the ministry than divine healing seed
[1:08:54] the sickest body i know of tonight is
[1:08:57] the so-called body of jesus christ it
[1:09:00] needs a spiritual healing there is only
[1:09:03] one bomb that i know that will heal and
[1:09:05] that's the word he said and that's the
[1:09:08] sick body that we want to stand up in
[1:09:10] the strength and the vitamin power of
[1:09:12] the gospel he said that's why i use much
[1:09:15] of the time now in trying to strengthen
[1:09:17] the church amen by the word they may
[1:09:20] strengthen the church by the word so
[1:09:22] then we have now found the source of
[1:09:25] strength that is coming to the church is
[1:09:27] by the word i find it amazing that we're
[1:09:29] living in a day and time when the world
[1:09:31] is full of pressure i believe it's a i
[1:09:34] believe it's a tape that we all know
[1:09:35] very well the prophet of god will preach
[1:09:37] letting off the pressure and i find that
[1:09:40] in that word pressure i'm not much of an
[1:09:42] educational person so you forgive me
[1:09:44] but i find there in the the root word of
[1:09:46] oppression is a word called press now
[1:09:49] when you look at the word pressure it
[1:09:51] means depressed when you look at the
[1:09:53] word oppression and then the root word
[1:09:55] of that word oppression is press the
[1:09:58] root word of the word suppression amen
[1:10:00] is press the root word of the word
[1:10:02] depression amen is press now i don't
[1:10:05] think it's a coincidence that god would
[1:10:07] send a prophet who would preach a
[1:10:09] message entitled letting off the
[1:10:11] pressure he said then i thought what
[1:10:13] would i speak to this congregation i
[1:10:15] thought well they're probably trained
[1:10:16] right in everything no doubt but there
[1:10:18] is a pressure on the people today and
[1:10:20] that pressure has no limitation or any
[1:10:23] denominational lines it has no age line
[1:10:26] it has no respect to persons it's on the
[1:10:28] young and the old it's on the good it's
[1:10:31] on the band it's on everybody it is
[1:10:33] pressure he said we are living in a
[1:10:35] neurotic age a nervous tension everybody
[1:10:38] is racing here and going there and going
[1:10:40] nowhere amen it's just that kind of age
[1:10:42] and i know this church would be plagued
[1:10:44] with it as everywhere is plagued with it
[1:10:46] he said the tabernacle has played with
[1:10:48] it everywhere the whole world is plagued
[1:10:50] amen with pressure it's a day of
[1:10:52] pressure amen hurry hurry hurry hurry
[1:10:55] hurry up and wait and they'll drive 90
[1:10:58] miles an hour then get home for supper
[1:11:00] and wait two hours till it gets ready
[1:11:02] amen it's a time that they're rushing
[1:11:04] and speeding it's a nervous tension the
[1:11:06] wife will say something a little
[1:11:08] contrary and you want to file for the
[1:11:10] temper the husband will say something
[1:11:12] then you'll pat your foot tell him to
[1:11:13] get in the other room say well now
[1:11:15] husband i don't want no words with you
[1:11:17] go out there and the husband will say
[1:11:19] why for i'm so nervous see what's the
[1:11:21] matter amen all this together this
[1:11:23] tension is building up and then the
[1:11:26] results of it is doing something wrong
[1:11:28] and acting out of place now think about
[1:11:31] that and then the only reason the devil
[1:11:33] is sending pressure is because he knows
[1:11:36] that you are the bride of jesus
[1:11:38] christ and he's trying to get you to act
[1:11:40] out of character of the way the round
[1:11:42] would act to get you to do something out
[1:11:44] of character
[1:11:46] he said do something wrong and act out a
[1:11:49] place that's right ain't that now watch
[1:11:51] this this pressure will make the poor
[1:11:53] act that way
[1:11:54] yeah it'll make the middle class act
[1:11:56] that way it'll make the rich act that
[1:11:58] way it'll make the wrong act that way
[1:12:01] you know makes a pretty good act that
[1:12:02] way it'll make the good act that way
[1:12:04] because it's tension it's steam it's
[1:12:07] built up it's got to blow out somewhere
[1:12:09] so you blow up the bull or he said now
[1:12:11] we find that it builds up as the day
[1:12:14] goes on now amen in the morning there's
[1:12:16] tension but in the afternoon there's
[1:12:18] more tension than there was in the
[1:12:19] morning by the evening there's more
[1:12:21] pressure than there was in the afternoon
[1:12:23] or the morning and then he said you'll
[1:12:25] talk to your boss if you're working on
[1:12:27] speak to him or the kitty will say come
[1:12:29] here mama amen there you are see it's
[1:12:31] all building up coming to a head now
[1:12:33] ain't been how many has hurt the tape
[1:12:35] letting off the pressure when brother
[1:12:36] man preaches that message he actually
[1:12:38] gets the inspiration ain't been from a
[1:12:40] gun that blew up in his face but he also
[1:12:42] tells a story about going to the
[1:12:44] hospital and visiting somebody and he
[1:12:46] said when he went in there he asked a
[1:12:48] nurse where is so-and-so and they said
[1:12:49] we'll go to this room and he went there
[1:12:51] and they weren't there and said go to
[1:12:52] this room and he went there and they
[1:12:54] weren't there and they said amen he said
[1:12:56] and everybody i was asking was under
[1:12:58] such pressure that they couldn't even
[1:12:59] answer the question the brother comes to
[1:13:01] the pulpit and says everybody is all
[1:13:04] built up haven't got no time he said and
[1:13:06] that builds up to a place that breaks up
[1:13:08] things it causes people to have hard
[1:13:10] feelings then they snap off and say
[1:13:12] things they don't mean to save he said
[1:13:14] now everybody is guilty of it i'm guilty
[1:13:22] he said you're guilty of it we do things
[1:13:24] under pressure that we wouldn't do
[1:13:26] otherwise and then there's an excess
[1:13:28] excess pressure they've been coming up
[1:13:30] today before i could go any further i
[1:13:33] might say this i believe it's the enemy
[1:13:36] coming down
[1:13:38] we have now discovered the source of
[1:13:40] pressure amen it's the enemy it's the
[1:13:43] devil coming down and pressing and we
[1:13:46] know that the coming of the lord is at
[1:13:47] hand and the bible said the last days of
[1:13:50] the devil would go about like a roaring
[1:13:52] lion if he could get you under pressure
[1:13:54] hurry running over something then you'll
[1:13:57] make a decision that you would make if
[1:13:59] you would sit down and take it over
[1:14:02] i announced to you that the time we're
[1:14:03] living in is a time of pressure
[1:14:06] but it's also an oppressing time the
[1:14:08] problem of god said we're going through
[1:14:10] a great oppressing time when theologies
[1:14:12] and everything of churches has said come
[1:14:14] join ours and come join ours amen but
[1:14:17] just as she begins to break dave and
[1:14:19] then the rushing mighty winds coming
[1:14:21] down the channel again and then right
[1:14:24] down into the church like it did at the
[1:14:26] beginning ain't been at the break of the
[1:14:28] day for the same holy ghost power is
[1:14:30] claiming the same gospel the way it was
[1:14:33] in the beginning it's claimed again here
[1:14:35] today i'm so glad that we are marching
[1:14:38] towards zion as the
[1:14:41] and what church tells me is the devil
[1:14:43] don't have enough pressure ain't been to
[1:14:45] stop the march of the church
[1:14:48] and yet we're not marching for socialism
[1:14:50] we're not marching for politics we're
[1:14:52] not marching for america and then we're
[1:14:58] [Music]
[1:15:03] amen i know it's a day of pressure it's
[1:15:04] a day when the devil is trying to put so
[1:15:06] much pressure upon us ain't been that we
[1:15:08] just threw up our hands and quit or put
[1:15:10] so much pressure upon us that we forget
[1:15:12] who we are ain't that but let me say
[1:15:14] you've been anointed to stand
[1:15:18] pressured to live in this age
[1:15:26] amen and here we are we're not in the
[1:15:28] fifth age we're not in the third age or
[1:15:30] even in the fourth age we're in the semi
[1:15:33] page where this pressure has been
[1:15:35] building from ephesus all the way to
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:56] [Music]
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:19] amen i've just recently been studying a
[1:16:21] little bit on the children of israel and
[1:16:22] i find it amazing it means that when you
[1:16:24] study israel in the church you will
[1:16:27] actually find that there is a parallel
[1:16:29] between israel the children of israel
[1:16:31] and the church of the living god now i
[1:16:33] said like this we didn't know
[1:16:35] that there was a parallel between israel
[1:16:37] and the church until a prophet come
[1:16:38] along and took an entire series called
[1:16:41] israel and the church in that five-part
[1:16:43] series he will open it with israel and
[1:16:46] egypt right then he'll take two parts on
[1:16:48] israel at the red sea then he comes
[1:16:50] along and says israel before the brazen
[1:16:53] serpent and israel at caenis barnea but
[1:16:56] i love the way he'll close that is he
[1:16:58] says israel in the homeland
[1:17:01] now there's a parallel between israel
[1:17:03] and the church amen if israel had a
[1:17:06] homeland amendments to you the bride has
[1:17:09] a homeland and the prophet said god
[1:17:11] never did deal with israel and then till
[1:17:13] she come to the homeland and hear me
[1:17:15] thus saith the lord god will not deal
[1:17:18] with this church until she comes back to
[1:17:20] the homeland amend the message of the
[1:17:23] hour
[1:17:25] and we've now identified the homeland of
[1:17:27] the church it's not a denomination it's
[1:17:30] not a psychology it's not a man's idea
[1:17:33] the homeland of the church is the
[1:17:35] message of the god he said it shall be
[1:17:38] lied about the even time amen it's god's
[1:17:41] only chosen place to worship he said
[1:17:43] what's this message come true what is he
[1:17:45] going to do and in this day it shall be
[1:17:48] light at the evening time and what to
[1:17:50] welcome back his children amen to the
[1:17:53] promised land by the same sign of the
[1:17:55] pillar of fire that led the children of
[1:17:57] israel through the wilderness they've
[1:17:59] been saved and now we've identified and
[1:18:01] then the parallel between israel and the
[1:18:03] church
[1:18:05] will have a holy land
[1:18:09] something else that you care about
[1:18:10] israel ain't that israel had an exodus
[1:18:13] and this bride has got an exodus
[1:18:17] israel had an exodus and this pride has
[1:18:19] got an exodus the prophet said the first
[1:18:21] yes he said in that first nation this
[1:18:24] what did he do he said he brought them
[1:18:26] out of the natural land amen to a
[1:18:28] natural land he said in the second
[1:18:30] exodus what did he do he brought them
[1:18:32] from a spiritual condition into a
[1:18:34] spiritual baptism of the holy ghost he
[1:18:36] said but now this third exodus he is
[1:18:39] bringing them from the spiritual baptism
[1:18:41] of the holy ghost and then right back
[1:18:43] into the eternal
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:53] and listen wave us the same word that
[1:18:55] declared the first exodus is the same
[1:18:57] word that declared the second word
[1:19:02] and may i announce to the devil tonight
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:20] and there ain't enough pressure out of
[1:19:21] the pits of hell
[1:19:26] right now i'll tell you what the devil's
[1:19:27] doing he's doing everything he can to
[1:19:29] stop this sexiness amen but i want to
[1:19:31] tell the devil he cannot stop this and
[1:19:33] then because he didn't start it
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:49] to his elected ones only to his elected
[1:19:52] and then you know what else i find
[1:19:54] amazing is that god placed a seed in
[1:19:57] israel for an exodus
[1:20:00] the prophet said the word exodus comes
[1:20:02] from the word calling out or going out
[1:20:04] he said now the children i love this the
[1:20:06] children of israel amen was exodus amen
[1:20:10] israel was exodus he said see now in
[1:20:13] order to correctly get the picture and
[1:20:16] then notice this of the church of the
[1:20:17] end and type it with today you've got to
[1:20:20] go back into the seed to bring it into
[1:20:22] exodus and then before it can have the
[1:20:24] exodus or bring it to where you can see
[1:20:27] where the church is and how they settled
[1:20:29] in egypt and then you'll see how god
[1:20:31] called them out amen so the focus was
[1:20:34] not how they got in egypt it was not
[1:20:36] what happened in egypt it was not the
[1:20:38] suffering to the egypt amendment the
[1:20:40] focus of israel
[1:20:46] amazing to me is god amen actually
[1:20:48] visited father abraham and gave him a
[1:20:51] vision and then many years before israel
[1:20:54] ever went into slavery it's in the book
[1:20:55] of genesis the 15th chapter and the
[1:20:57] first verse after these things amen the
[1:21:00] word of the lord came unto abram in a
[1:21:01] vision saying him fear not abram i am
[1:21:04] thy shield and not exceeding great
[1:21:06] reward then you drop down to the 12th
[1:21:08] verse and it says when the sun was going
[1:21:10] down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo
[1:21:13] amen a horror of great darkness fell
[1:21:15] upon him and he said unto abram amen no
[1:21:18] other charity than thy seed amen shall
[1:21:20] be a stranger in a land that is not
[1:21:22] theirs and shall serve them and they
[1:21:25] shall afflict them for 400 years and
[1:21:28] also that nation whom they shall serve
[1:21:30] and then will i judge and afterwards and
[1:21:33] then shall they come out with great
[1:21:34] steps
[1:21:35] and then notice it didn't tell him what
[1:21:37] was going to happen
[1:21:39] holy it didn't tell him how long it was
[1:21:41] going to be there even but there was a
[1:21:43] promise of inheritance there was a
[1:21:45] promise that whatever they went in with
[1:21:47] is what they're coming out with and that
[1:21:49] they're going to come out with great
[1:21:51] substance the problem of god said look
[1:21:53] here ain't been gone for telling
[1:21:55] way down in his great great great
[1:21:57] grandchildren that they would so turn in
[1:21:59] a strange land for 400 years and would
[1:22:02] be afflicted now notice this it was a
[1:22:04] designated time exactly how long it
[1:22:08] would be
[1:22:09] he meant before israel ever went into
[1:22:11] egypt amen god already knew when they
[1:22:14] was coming out and then before israel
[1:22:16] faced the first past master god already
[1:22:18] had identified
[1:22:20] he said like this he had done put limits
[1:22:22] on the devil yeah so you only got 400
[1:22:25] years so what you gonna do you better do
[1:22:27] in 400 years
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:50] it needs to be occupied it means to be
[1:22:52] busy with it needs to oppress it means
[1:22:55] to humble it needs to bow down it needs
[1:22:58] to be downcast it needs to be humiliated
[1:23:01] it means to weaken oneself in other
[1:23:04] words the vision told abraham your seed
[1:23:06] is going to be weakened they're going to
[1:23:08] be downcast they're going to be
[1:23:10] humiliated they're going to be bowed
[1:23:12] down they're going to be busy they're
[1:23:14] going to be occupied amen but don't
[1:23:16] worry about that i'm going to bring them
[1:23:18] out
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:21] before there was one taskmaster aiming
[1:23:24] to oppress or to afflict israel amen
[1:23:26] there was a vision concern
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:31] in egypt amen let me announce to you
[1:23:33] that we've got many task masters in
[1:23:35] laodicea amen one is a task master it is
[1:23:38] a person who imposes even a harsh
[1:23:41] hanging or requesting workload on
[1:23:43] someone now i'm not going to and then
[1:23:45] i'm trying to lay a foundation if that's
[1:23:47] okay i'm not going to read to the first
[1:23:49] four chapters of the book of exodus but
[1:23:50] if it's okay i do want to preach it to
[1:23:52] you for a second in the first chapter of
[1:23:54] exodus we find out that pharaoh orders
[1:23:57] all the sons to be killed amen what did
[1:23:59] he say cast them into the river then we
[1:24:02] find the reason he'd done that is
[1:24:03] because payroll ain't that the
[1:24:05] unrighteous was after the righteous seed
[1:24:08] of thomas which was going to be moses
[1:24:10] but it said now see what we can do amen
[1:24:13] is we can type that with jesus
[1:24:16] he said satan has always amen tried to
[1:24:19] kill the promised seed that was carrying
[1:24:22] thomas
[1:24:23] he said he tried to quarter it and he
[1:24:25] tried to kill it he said the first time
[1:24:27] he done it was with abel he said i'll
[1:24:29] kill abel and i'll get the seed he said
[1:24:31] now watch he killed abel and god raised
[1:24:34] himself and he said and he's done that
[1:24:36] all the way down the top of the baptism
[1:24:38] and he said when he killed john the
[1:24:40] baptist amen the devil said i've got him
[1:24:42] now he said but the problem was he was
[1:24:44] already at jesus
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:58] and it went into moses and it went into
[1:25:00] enoch and it went in the time the
[1:25:01] baptist and it went into jesus
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:22] is
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:30] are you hearing me you're carrying a
[1:25:32] seed of exodus and then he was trying to
[1:25:34] kill that seed we leave next to the
[1:25:36] swarm we find in exodus 2 that moses
[1:25:39] ain't them the deliverer was born aimed
[1:25:42] with a predestinated seed in him
[1:25:44] there was a predestinated seed in moses
[1:25:47] notice this moses had to receive his own
[1:25:51] revelation are you hearing me he had to
[1:25:53] receive his own revelation amen of who
[1:25:56] he was
[1:25:58] and what his commission was now where
[1:26:01] did he receive that revelation we find
[1:26:03] that he received that revelation of the
[1:26:05] burning bush do you realize there's a
[1:26:07] big difference amen and you're receiving
[1:26:09] a revelation and somebody giving you
[1:26:12] their revelation
[1:26:14] hello there's a big difference in you
[1:26:16] receiving a revelation and you're
[1:26:18] receiving a revelation amen let me show
[1:26:20] you the prophet of god said moses his
[1:26:22] mother told him he was the promised seed
[1:26:25] she told him he was delivered his father
[1:26:28] told him we've been praying for you he
[1:26:30] said brother madam said that they had
[1:26:32] the revelation moses was delivered and
[1:26:35] they told moses for revelation and moses
[1:26:38] received an intellectual revelation from
[1:26:40] his parents that he was a deliverer and
[1:26:43] one day he steps out and he sees an
[1:26:45] egyptians by the hebrew and something
[1:26:48] raised up in moses and goes over and
[1:26:50] kills the attention and pharaoh hears
[1:26:53] about it and pharaoh comes looking for
[1:26:55] moses and the bible uses these words
[1:26:58] moses feared and moses fled at the
[1:27:01] slaying of one attention amen but listen
[1:27:03] to me church we find after that he went
[1:27:06] to the burning bush and the problem of
[1:27:08] god said the pillar of fire amen came
[1:27:10] down and consumed that bush and he said
[1:27:12] god's direct quote he said god put some
[1:27:15] faith in moses from the fire
[1:27:18] glory after that preaching right there
[1:27:20] and god took some faith out of the veil
[1:27:22] of fire and placed it into moses as why
[1:27:26] and the prophet said to watch moses goes
[1:27:28] home and saddles up from you
[1:27:31] and gathers his wife and his baby amen
[1:27:34] and says we're going down to egypt to
[1:27:35] take over amen listen the difference in
[1:27:38] experience will make he met when he when
[1:27:40] he had intellectual experience he slew
[1:27:42] one egyptian at the first bit of
[1:27:44] pressure
[1:27:45] [Music]
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:26] are
[1:28:28] moses went from an intellectual
[1:28:29] experience he went into a revelation the
[1:28:32] problem of god said moses tried he meant
[1:28:34] to deliver israel by pickling
[1:28:35] freelancing he said but god had to give
[1:28:38] moses amen listen god had to give moses
[1:28:41] a scriptural sign and then notice this
[1:28:43] in order to deliver the people by
[1:28:47] he had to give moses a scriptural sign
[1:28:50] in order to deliver the people back in
[1:28:53] other words when moses went to the
[1:28:55] burning bush
[1:28:56] there was a voice that spoke to abraham
[1:28:59] and said your seed was so turned in a
[1:29:01] strange land and then that voice that
[1:29:03] spoke to abraham was the same voice that
[1:29:07] come down in the burning bush and spoke
[1:29:09] to moses they said the voice came out of
[1:29:11] abraham amen the voice came out of the
[1:29:14] burning bush and the voice went into
[1:29:16] moses in other words when moses left the
[1:29:19] burning bush he left saying the same
[1:29:21] thing that abraham heard amen my seat
[1:29:25] was so turned into this translation
[1:29:27] after 400 years i will deliver them and
[1:29:30] the bible says in exodus 2 23 that it
[1:29:33] came to pass in the process of time and
[1:29:36] then that the king of egypt died and the
[1:29:38] children of israel sighed amen by reason
[1:29:41] of the bondage and they cried and their
[1:29:43] cry came up unto god by reason of his
[1:29:45] bondage and god hearing their growing
[1:29:48] and god remember his covenant with
[1:29:50] abraham amen with isaac and with jacob
[1:29:53] and god looked upon the children of
[1:29:54] israel and god had respect amen or
[1:29:57] acclaiming to them in other words god
[1:30:00] respects his seed and then watch this
[1:30:02] now in exodus 3 god actually calls and
[1:30:06] then moses to deliver his children from
[1:30:08] the mud pits of egypt the bible says in
[1:30:10] verse seven that the lord said i have
[1:30:12] surely seen the affliction of the people
[1:30:14] which are in egypt and i have heard
[1:30:16] their cry by the reason they're
[1:30:17] taskmasters for i know their sorrows and
[1:30:20] i o god and i am come down to deliver
[1:30:24] them out of the hand of the egyptians
[1:30:27] and to bring them out of the land into a
[1:30:29] good land and a large lamb amen flown
[1:30:31] with milk and honey under the place of
[1:30:33] the canaanites and the hittites from the
[1:30:35] amorites and the perizzites and the
[1:30:37] highlights amen and the jebusites in
[1:30:39] other words the prophet said i have come
[1:30:41] down amen i'm sending me it was god
[1:30:45] going in the form of the man
[1:30:49] is coming to me and i have also seen the
[1:30:52] oppression where with the egyptians have
[1:30:55] oppressed them and then moses saw the
[1:30:57] oppression amen let me say this there
[1:31:00] was egypt they've been pressing israel
[1:31:02] pressing the sea pressing they exit the
[1:31:05] sea and then the watch moses ran down
[1:31:07] there and delivered them a message and
[1:31:10] then we're going to leave here we're not
[1:31:12] going to stay here under the pressure of
[1:31:14] the task masters under the oppression of
[1:31:17] these slave drivers we're going to leave
[1:31:19] here and the bible says israel actually
[1:31:21] received the man oh god they received
[1:31:24] the message of moses and it actually
[1:31:26] caused him to go into a bit of a revival
[1:31:29] at the word of deliverance in other
[1:31:31] words moses went down there and they
[1:31:33] didn't have to work it up ain't been
[1:31:35] they had to receive what god said
[1:31:39] are you hearing me
[1:31:40] anybody want a revival anybody want a
[1:31:42] refreshing from the presence of god i
[1:31:44] meet a lot of people by the way and they
[1:31:46] say we got to work it out we got to pump
[1:31:48] it up we got to get something going to
[1:31:50] get it here ain't that let me say this
[1:31:52] we ain't got to work it out ain't that
[1:31:54] the only thing you got to do to receive
[1:31:56] delivers is
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:09] on the ohio river
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:20] and by receiving what god was sending
[1:32:22] and ran into them
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:32] we're not staying here
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:49] have you ever been there and you've ever
[1:32:51] wondered if god cares let me tell you
[1:32:53] something god cares about your
[1:32:55] afflictions the bible said that people
[1:32:57] believed and when they heard that the
[1:32:59] lord had visited the children of israel
[1:33:01] and that he had looked upon their
[1:33:02] affliction they found their heads and
[1:33:05] they worshipped amen i don't know if you
[1:33:06] catch this or not but i'm gonna preach
[1:33:08] it to you amen they pound their heads to
[1:33:11] worship when they receive the message
[1:33:13] yeah exodus 4 31 when the recognition
[1:33:16] come to their hearts amen that god knows
[1:33:19] what you're going through he knows the
[1:33:20] pressure surrender he knows the
[1:33:22] situations you're facing when they
[1:33:24] receive that revelation in their heart
[1:33:26] and it throw them into a worship in
[1:33:29] other words the message didn't pop them
[1:33:31] down and then the mass caused them to
[1:33:33] worship and then the message
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:46] they've been shout for years and dancing
[1:33:48] for years and didn't have a clue what
[1:33:49] they were shouting out didn't have a
[1:33:51] clue what they were dancing about amen
[1:33:53] but now god has sent a word in this show
[1:33:56] to deliver his sins amen listen friends
[1:33:59] we are an identified place of worship we
[1:34:01] are under an identified message we are
[1:34:03] following the identified star we are
[1:34:05] marching to the statified player of time
[1:34:09] the prophet said we noticed that one
[1:34:11] time god's children were slaves amen
[1:34:13] down in egypt amen they throw them bread
[1:34:15] molded rotten whatever it was they had
[1:34:18] to eat it they ravished their girls they
[1:34:20] killed their sons anything they would
[1:34:23] amen was the people to do the people of
[1:34:25] god that's right even they were slaves
[1:34:27] and they could not help it amen you know
[1:34:29] what i find amazing is right after
[1:34:31] exodus 4 31 you will read exodus 5 when
[1:34:34] the bible says that the children of
[1:34:36] israel went unto pharaoh and said we
[1:34:38] want to go and we want to worship unto
[1:34:40] god we want to go worship unto god and
[1:34:42] the bible says that pharaoh looked upon
[1:34:44] him and said well if you've got time to
[1:34:46] worship amen then we're not going to
[1:34:48] bring you strong and make bricks amen
[1:34:50] now you have to go get your own strong
[1:34:52] in other words payroll thought this amen
[1:34:54] if they got time to worship then they
[1:34:56] got time to work they didn't notice when
[1:34:59] pharaoh increased their affliction when
[1:35:01] he increased the oppression amen was
[1:35:03] what israel was desiring to go sacrifice
[1:35:07] unto the lord
[1:35:08] amen pharaoh's motive was this amen
[1:35:11] oppress them until they cannot worship
[1:35:14] they may oppress them until they cannot
[1:35:16] worship you know i read a book one time
[1:35:18] about slavery back in the 1800s amen how
[1:35:20] did they tell the slave owners don't let
[1:35:22] them people work or don't let them
[1:35:24] worship when they get done working if
[1:35:25] they got any spare time don't let them
[1:35:27] worship you know why because they got to
[1:35:29] read about they got to hear about how
[1:35:31] them slaves amen would get done with
[1:35:33] their work and they would have shackles
[1:35:35] on their hands they would have shackles
[1:35:37] on their feet but they would get
[1:35:38] together in a group of multitude and
[1:35:40] they would begin to worship god amen and
[1:35:43] history acts and records that when they
[1:35:45] would begin to worship god that
[1:35:47] something would happen and the shackles
[1:35:49] would fall for him the shackles would
[1:35:51] fall off the shackles
[1:35:56] let me say this he's still god
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:06] [Music]

[1:36:31] it because he's god

[1:36:39] it was this oppress them until they
[1:36:41] cannot worship do you realize when the
[1:36:43] pressure come is when israel wanted to
[1:36:45] go sacrifice unto the lord in other
[1:36:49] words pharaoh said if they want to go to
[1:36:50] church on a saturday night

[1:43:24] and in their heavens amen but man else
[1:43:26] to you it's time to worship him before
[1:43:28] the earth
[1:43:29] oh man i don't know i ain't got nothing
[1:43:31] to worship before he woke you up this
[1:43:34] morning
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:47] is
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:58] after the message is delivered it's
[1:44:00] worship time
[1:44:02] that's right somebody next didn't say
[1:44:04] it's worship town after the message is
[1:44:07] delivered it's worship time and i know
[1:44:10] it's i know it's people getting their
[1:44:11] minds after the preaching the service is
[1:44:13] over but in reality the promise in the
[1:44:15] early church he said after some godly
[1:44:17] man gave the message they raised up
[1:44:19] their hands and praised god they loved
[1:44:22] the after effects of the holy spirit
[1:44:25] bathing through them that was the early
[1:44:28] church and then after the message
[1:44:33] they loved the after effects of the holy
[1:44:36] ghost in a message who is this direct
[1:44:38] prophetic instructions he says now amen
[1:44:41] after the message let's just bow our
[1:44:43] heads and worship him as we sing to him
[1:44:46] how many really love him
[1:44:48] he said raise your hands i really love
[1:44:50] him oh isn't he wonderful amen his word
[1:44:53] has gone forth amen it's fallen into the
[1:44:56] hearts it corrects us it brings us into
[1:44:59] subjection to his spirit how lovely it
[1:45:02] is just to worship him then in other
[1:45:05] words the prophet is saying that the
[1:45:07] power of worship should be stronger
[1:45:09] after the word than it was before the
[1:45:12] world
[1:45:13] the service should go down amen the
[1:45:16] service should go up and then from the
[1:45:18] first song the service may be here and
[1:45:21] then the next song that goes here and
[1:45:23] the next song that goes here and the
[1:45:24] word comes forth and the church goes
[1:45:26] here and then you're not supposed to
[1:45:28] stop there after the word has gone forth
[1:45:31] it's now time to worship
[1:45:34] we should go higher than we are right
[1:45:36] now
[1:45:37] the promising as you go from the church
[1:45:40] they've been gold worshipping him but
[1:45:42] people say to the brown amen i can't
[1:45:44] worship he said people come to church
[1:45:45] and they just go because it's their duty
[1:45:48] or because it's a certain minister amen
[1:45:50] or somebody in the land he said but we
[1:45:52] really ought to go to church amen to
[1:45:54] find christ let's go to church notice
[1:45:57] this let's go to church to worship teal
[1:46:01] you can expel all your guilt and shame
[1:46:04] and throw all the world that's glued out
[1:46:06] of your heart and let christ come in and
[1:46:09] then god's satisfied portion his spirit
[1:46:12] is here his spirit wants to move in his
[1:46:15] church
[1:46:16] praise the lord
[1:46:18] his spirit is here his spirit wants to
[1:46:21] move in his church let's come to church
[1:46:24] to worship the deal i don't know he
[1:46:27] didn't say sit there until all the guilt
[1:46:29] is gone and all the shame is gone and
[1:46:31] all the gloominess is gone and all the
[1:46:33] unbelief he said worship until it's gone
[1:46:36] and then when it's gone there'll be a
[1:46:37] real worship church
[1:46:41] his spirit is here his spirit wants to
[1:46:44] move in his church amen i find it
[1:46:46] amazing that after israel received the
[1:46:48] message
[1:46:49] that pharaoh again increased their
[1:46:51] oppression he increased their
[1:46:53] even when they went to worship you know
[1:46:55] what he used brother he used their daily
[1:46:57] task to oppress them what they had to
[1:47:00] get done through the day is what pharaoh
[1:47:02] used to oppress them the bible says
[1:47:05] instead of breaking them strong now
[1:47:07] israel had to go gather the straw which
[1:47:09] would make them more busy let me just
[1:47:11] say this and i'll hurry over this real
[1:47:13] quick because i want to get somewhere
[1:47:15] amen we are living in a day and time
[1:47:17] where people are i've got more gadgets
[1:47:19] technology things to make more time and
[1:47:22] we've got less time now than we've ever
[1:47:24] had
[1:47:25] that's right are you are you hearing
[1:47:27] them we got washing machines that'll
[1:47:29] turn themselves on they'll just about
[1:47:31] load their clothes for you they've got
[1:47:33] dryers that are just about drying for
[1:47:35] you are you voting for you ain't we got
[1:47:37] refrigerators it meant that you've not
[1:47:39] got to have an education to even turn
[1:47:41] the thing on are you hearing me all
[1:47:43] these things the world is increasing to
[1:47:45] try to bring it more easy even but in
[1:47:48] reality we're more busy than we've ever
[1:47:49] been before you know what the word busy
[1:47:51] means it means having a great deal to do
[1:47:54] or occupied or concentrating on a
[1:47:56] particular activity or object of
[1:47:58] attention how many knows that you spell
[1:48:00] the word busy b-u-s-y right yeah did i
[1:48:03] tell you what busy means amen be means
[1:48:05] being you under s satan's why yoke
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:12] being under satan's yoke listen friends
[1:48:16] it's not that you're backslidden it's
[1:48:18] not that you're overcome it's not that
[1:48:20] your serpent seed amen listen israel was
[1:48:23] still the saint of god when pharaoh
[1:48:26] increased their daily tasks i'm gonna
[1:48:28] like this israel's fathers had to go get
[1:48:31] them strong now whereas before it was
[1:48:33] brought to him now we're live in a day
[1:48:35] and time amen where a family can even
[1:48:37] get by and then the father is going to
[1:48:38] have two childs sometimes the wife's
[1:48:40] even got to have a child even because
[1:48:42] it's the age we're living in but pharaoh
[1:48:45] knew if we oppress them enough and we
[1:48:47] afflict them enough amen before long
[1:48:50] they'll lose sight of what moses told
[1:48:51] them and they'll be happy in egypt but
[1:48:54] let me let the devil in hell know there
[1:48:56] is nothing he can put upon me that will
[1:48:59] cause me to recount on my confession i'm
[1:49:02] leaving
[1:49:04] political pressure
[1:49:08] on the theme and pressure anything to
[1:49:10] cause the church of the living god to
[1:49:12] back home but the message of the hour we
[1:49:15] are here and we are going nowhere and
[1:49:18] then i find it amazing that jesus in the
[1:49:20] ephesian church age actually warns the
[1:49:23] church of what they call the deeds of
[1:49:25] the nicolaitis right you know what jesus
[1:49:27] said he hated the deeds of the
[1:49:29] nicolaitans the prophet said what does
[1:49:31] nico mean it means to conquer what does
[1:49:34] leos mean the laity if the laity were
[1:49:37] being conquered then it must have been
[1:49:39] some authority there to do it amen what
[1:49:41] was it that god hated that was happening
[1:49:43] in the church what was going on in there
[1:49:46] now is going on to are you hearing me
[1:49:48] what was going on then it's now going on
[1:49:51] today is exactly what the word
[1:49:53] nicolaitan means the people were being
[1:49:56] subjected somehow in a way that was
[1:49:59] absolutely contrary to the word of god
[1:50:02] and then the people were being oppressed
[1:50:04] they were being depressed they were
[1:50:06] being suppressed into a way that was
[1:50:09] contrary to the word of god amen paul
[1:50:11] being a prophet taught by the holy ghost
[1:50:14] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:50:16] christ and said anyone that did anything
[1:50:18] different from his preaching was
[1:50:19] accursed then it is time to wake up and
[1:50:22] see that the church is no longer
[1:50:24] controlled by the holy ghost but it is
[1:50:26] controlled by the nicolaitans that's why
[1:50:29] paul would write i fear after my
[1:50:31] departing that grievous wolves amen will
[1:50:34] enter in among you not spirit the flock
[1:50:37] in other words subjecting you to things
[1:50:39] that paul didn't teach well can i have
[1:50:40] some liberty here
[1:50:42] in other words
[1:50:43] pulpits and they're going to say you got
[1:50:45] to follow my opinion other than what
[1:50:48] reynolds said you're going to follow the
[1:50:50] way i see it even if it's not the way
[1:50:52] william called it remember let me tell
[1:50:54] you there is one young man that's got
[1:50:56] enough breath in his body amen that i'll
[1:50:59] stand like they did the days of call and
[1:51:01] say that's not what paul
[1:51:06] [Music]
[1:51:07] [Applause]
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:22] and press back against the spirits of
[1:51:24] the antichrist that's trying to oppress
[1:51:27] the pride of christ well but then i
[1:51:29] don't think it really matters i tell you
[1:51:30] what there's a war in the land right now
[1:51:32] amen but listen you've not been placed
[1:51:34] here without a weapon to defend yourself
[1:51:36] you are not on the defense you were only
[1:51:39] all things yeah
[1:51:41] come on church you're not on the defense
[1:51:44] you're on the offense
[1:51:46] we're on the defense no we're not at one
[1:51:48] time we were amen kind of takes some
[1:51:50] liberty here and preached and you
[1:51:51] realize that there was a moses and then
[1:51:53] there was a joshua you realize that in
[1:51:55] the bible there was a moses and a joshua
[1:51:57] and you realize william adams even came
[1:51:59] in the last days where the compound
[1:52:01] ministry of both moses and elijah in the
[1:52:04] days of moses and the children of israel
[1:52:07] was under amen moses they was on the
[1:52:09] defense you say can you prove it by the
[1:52:11] bible yes sir i can because the bible
[1:52:13] says that pharaoh's army ain't then
[1:52:15] chased them to the red sea they was on
[1:52:18] the defense they remember when they
[1:52:19] switched under the offense under
[1:52:21] joshua's ministry the bible said the
[1:52:24] enemy ran from them and ran into a war
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:35] joshua went down there and said i'll
[1:52:37] tear the walls down to get to your bunch
[1:52:39] of devils
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:49] is
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:58] this
[1:52:58] is my message
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:24] yes you do even because paul saw it
[1:53:27] coming amen i love this brother
[1:53:29] he warned them about this subtle
[1:53:32] priesthood
[1:53:34] now come on it wasn't a coincidence that
[1:53:36] paul and william brown would use the
[1:53:38] same word that moses did when he wrote
[1:53:39] about the serpent the gal and eve
[1:53:42] what did he say through the septility
[1:53:45] the serpent was subtle more suddenly
[1:53:47] than he beats the field when paul wrote
[1:53:49] about it amen paul when used the word in
[1:53:51] second corinthians 11 i fear as the
[1:53:53] serpent begotten through his septimity
[1:53:56] that your mind should be converted
[1:53:58] perverted from the simplicity of the
[1:53:59] gospel that's in christ when will
[1:54:01] branham come along and identify the same
[1:54:04] devil oh god he used the same word moses
[1:54:06] used he used the same word paul used and
[1:54:09] said it'll be a simple priesthood that
[1:54:11] will come in and take over with its
[1:54:12] false doctrines
[1:54:15] he knew they would implement a way of
[1:54:17] worship that excluded the people from
[1:54:19] any part in a holy spirit ministry and
[1:54:22] even right today among us those who
[1:54:24] claim to be full and free of the spirit
[1:54:27] there's not too much freedom in the
[1:54:29] laity and the best we can see is a few
[1:54:32] preachers with inspired preaching while
[1:54:34] the plot just sits there and tries to
[1:54:36] absorb it this is a far cry from what
[1:54:40] paul said that when we all came together
[1:54:42] all had the leaning of the spirit and
[1:54:45] all
[1:54:46] participated in spiritual worship amen
[1:54:49] when we all come together even brother
[1:54:52] thomas all will be led by the spirit
[1:54:54] amen all would participate in spiritual
[1:54:57] worship and the church corporate has
[1:55:00] never learned this lesson from the
[1:55:01] scripture or from history every time god
[1:55:04] gives a visitation of the holy spirit
[1:55:06] and people get free after a while they
[1:55:09] find themselves right back into the very
[1:55:12] thing they came out of oh yes revelation
[1:55:14] 12 that old had many dollars and
[1:55:17] those dollars are just like mother they
[1:55:19] set the word aside they deny the work of
[1:55:22] the spirit of god and they subjugate the
[1:55:24] laity and make it impossible for the
[1:55:27] laity to worship god unless they come to
[1:55:29] them or through their pattern which is
[1:55:32] nothing but a blueprint of unbelief
[1:55:35] to himself there are people amen who
[1:55:38] read history listen upon god there are
[1:55:40] people who will read history shrug their
[1:55:43] shoulders and go back to believe in a
[1:55:46] lie you realize there's people around
[1:55:47] this message right now and then they've
[1:55:50] got books and tapes and they read a
[1:55:52] prophet saying that the purple has been
[1:55:54] identified among the church they read it
[1:55:57] and they go back to their church and
[1:55:59] some priesthood says the third tool was
[1:56:01] only for brother adam it's not for you
[1:56:04] so they believe the truth and go back to
[1:56:06] believing a lie but come on church we're
[1:56:08] not going to take an exodus by false
[1:56:10] doctrines we're not going to take an
[1:56:11] exodus by man's impressions
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:26] shut their shoulders and go back to
[1:56:28] believing a lie it's not in the word
[1:56:30] they've been but men put it in their own
[1:56:32] book and by it took over people even
[1:56:35] ruling them by fear now amen can i take
[1:56:38] a little liberty here
[1:56:39] amen i'm not against quote books amen i
[1:56:41] thank god for quote books amen but i am
[1:56:44] against men's quote books
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:47] what are you saying i'm saying if you're
[1:56:48] going to put a quote book together amen
[1:56:50] put a quote book together and say what
[1:56:52] william branham said
[1:56:54] don't hand me what
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:02] to subjugate the laity apart from the
[1:57:05] church let me brother one i hope it's
[1:57:07] okay all right let me just say this if
[1:57:09] god said i don't know why i'm going this
[1:57:11] way but i'm following him if god set you
[1:57:13] under a pastor there may be other men
[1:57:16] around the country that you love to hear
[1:57:18] amen but you cannot judge what your
[1:57:20] pastor is saying by what another man
[1:57:22] says
[1:57:25] oh god help me out that's close to my
[1:57:27] are you hearing me
[1:57:29] say what are you saying well brother
[1:57:30] juan speaks something and i think
[1:57:32] brother so-and-so has got a better
[1:57:34] opinion of what he said i want to take
[1:57:35] brother so and so and i want us to
[1:57:37] reject brother warren brother juan is
[1:57:39] the pastor he is following the pillar of
[1:57:41] fire he is leading he is being led by
[1:57:44] the spirit of god he is preaching what a
[1:57:46] prophet already said listen if you're
[1:57:48] going to correct him correcting by the
[1:57:50] word
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:58:02] you know what will happen that that will
[1:58:03] rear his head up in the church and
[1:58:05] before long the whole church will go
[1:58:07] from back in the word ain't meant to
[1:58:08] question the word and then then
[1:58:10] somebody'll have a little bible study
[1:58:12] somewhere and they'll get a little
[1:58:13] uprising against what the pastor said oh
[1:58:16] god i'm preaching now amen let me say
[1:58:18] this if you're a part of this exodus the
[1:58:20] very moment you see that spirit raise
[1:58:23] its head it will something will raise up
[1:58:25] in you and the devils
[1:58:34] [Music]
[1:58:38] was led by feelings and sensations and
[1:58:40] emotions and dreams amen but this bride
[1:58:43] is led by an adoption message things
[1:58:46] lead her into a state of perfection by
[1:58:49] the world
[1:58:50] oh god amen said come back amen to the
[1:58:53] word amen can i have a few more minutes
[1:58:56] in a few more minutes the problem of god
[1:58:58] said the last stage you know what else
[1:58:59] they're going to do they're going to
[1:59:00] become lukewarm
[1:59:01] so they're going to subjugate the laity
[1:59:03] so the church becomes lukewarm then the
[1:59:06] church becomes lukewarm it becomes
[1:59:08] formal you know what it dies by being
[1:59:10] powerless it goes from lukewarm to being
[1:59:13] horrible to be in powers and i promise
[1:59:15] that god hates a powerless religion he
[1:59:18] realized the prophecy like this he said
[1:59:20] the baptist and the methodist and the
[1:59:23] church of christ and the pentecostals
[1:59:25] have all esteemed their word above god's
[1:59:28] word until this last stage god says i'm
[1:59:31] going against all of it i'm going to
[1:59:33] spew you out of my mouth this is the end
[1:59:36] for seven out of seven ages i have seen
[1:59:39] nothing but men esteeming their own word
[1:59:41] of my mind so at the end of this i'm
[1:59:44] gonna spew you out of my mouth it's all
[1:59:46] over i'm going to speak all right yes i
[1:59:49] am here i am in the midst of the church
[1:59:51] the amen of god the faithful the true
[1:59:55] will repeal himself and it will be my
[1:59:58] prophecy

[2:02:11] with the holy ghost and with power who
[2:02:14] went about doing good and healing and
[2:02:17] then all somebody say oh

[2:02:26] moses was i don't think it's coincident
[2:02:28] sister that a prophet of god preaches an
[2:02:30] entire tape called dr moses and what are
[2:02:33] you a type of doctor with you connect
[2:02:35] healing with the doctor
[2:02:37] in other words moses came into the mud
[2:02:39] pits of egypt as a spiritual doctor with
[2:02:42] a message of healing to a wounded people
[2:02:45] who was afflicted and was oppressed by
[2:02:48] the task masters of leonism and the
[2:02:50] bible says that god would send jesus a
[2:02:53] second time amen and he would heal all
[2:02:55] that were oppressed of the devil what is
[2:02:58] that devil the devil is a false accuser
[2:03:01] the devil is a slanderer he is saint in
[2:03:03] the prince of demons he is the author of
[2:03:05] evil even persecuting good men
[2:03:08] estranging mankind from god and enticing
[2:03:11] them to sin are you hearing me now
[2:03:13] afflicting them with disease just by
[2:03:16] means of demons who take possession of

[2:03:21] reading this with me now of demons
[2:03:24] come on preach back at me of demons
[2:03:27] who take possession
[2:03:29] of demons
[2:03:30] who take possession amen i want to say
[2:03:32] it like this what is healing the prophet
[2:03:34] said healing is your personal faith in a
[2:03:37] finished work at calvary that the lord
[2:03:39] jesus christ did by him at calvary when
[2:03:42] he purchased your salvation and your
[2:03:45] healing listen tonight friends the
[2:03:47] prophet said oh my there is a vast
[2:03:49] difference in looking at god's word and
[2:03:52] receiving god's word he said now when
[2:03:54] you receive the inspiration amen can you
[2:03:57] preach with me tonight stand back at me
[2:03:59] when i receive
[2:04:01] the inspiration
[2:04:02] he says when you receive the inspiration
[2:04:05] that jesus christ died for your sickness
[2:04:07] it's that very hour that your healing
[2:04:11] has come
[2:04:12] [Applause]
[2:04:14] when you receive the inspiration that
[2:04:17] jesus christ died for your healing it's
[2:04:20] that very hour you receive your healing
[2:04:24] your healing has come that's right oh
[2:04:27] god when you receive from heaven
[2:04:29] somebody say from heaven
[2:04:31] when you receive from heaven that jesus
[2:04:34] died for your sins and you have accepted
[2:04:37] it you don't need any prayer then you've
[2:04:39] already accepted it it's settled now we
[2:04:42] can preach the word but you can explain
[2:04:44] the word but you've got to receive the
[2:04:46] word he said that's what's set to the
[2:04:49] fire brother are you all ready for this
[2:04:51] are y'all ready for this when you
[2:04:53] receive it the revelation something
[2:04:56] slips out of the unseen world yonder
[2:04:59] comes rolling down through a mystical
[2:05:02] channel somewhere into your soul and
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:15] and every muscle in your body seems to

[2:05:32] was under amendment from heaven ain't
[2:05:35] enrolling through a mystical channel and

[2:05:39] planned abraham rolled into moses and
[2:05:42] were rolled into moses he rolled into
[2:05:44] egypt and began to preach to israel what
[2:05:47] role into him by the mystic channel and
[2:05:50] when israel received it it changed them
[2:05:53] from being the depressed to be in the
[2:05:55] oppressed to be in the people pressing
[2:05:57] back
[2:05:59] are you all hearing me before israel
[2:06:01] received the message
[2:06:02] pharaoh could control him but after

[2:40:07] verse 7 the bible says and when there
[2:40:09] have been much disputing
[2:40:12] peter rose up and said unto them men and
[2:40:14] brethren
[2:40:16] no you know how that
[2:40:19] a good white gold god
[2:40:22] made choice among us
[2:40:25] that the gentiles by my mom should hear
[2:40:28] the word of the gospel and believe
[2:40:31] listen to this
[2:40:32] he said and god
[2:40:34] wish nowhere the hearts
[2:40:37] bear witness
[2:40:39] giving them the holy ghost
[2:40:42] even as he did unto
[2:40:46] us and put no difference between us and
[2:40:50] them
[2:40:52] purely firing their hearts
[2:40:55] by faith
[2:40:57] so peter is testifying or what happened
[2:41:00] in colena's house
[2:41:02] he said i watched the world purifying
[2:41:05] the house of the people
[2:41:07] i stood there preaching and i saw how
[2:41:10] the world
[2:41:12] was delivering the people
[2:41:15] and the bible says while they hear these
[2:41:18] words
[2:41:19] the holy ghost
[2:41:20] fell upon them
[2:41:22] praise the lord
[2:41:24] i believe we can go back home the same

[2:42:02] that the holy spirit will come and speak
[2:42:03] to us about healing
[2:42:06] because he knows we are hurting
[2:42:08] praise the lord
[2:42:10] he knows as a church we are hurting
[2:42:13] we have just lost one that is dear to us
[2:42:16] and different things are happening
[2:42:19] people going through different things in
[2:42:20] their life young people
[2:42:24] marriage couple
[2:42:26] and yet god's mercy the god that is rich
[2:42:29] in mercy
[2:42:31] came down in our midst
[2:42:36] identifying our condition
[2:42:39] and speaking to everybody speaking to
[2:42:42] the young people speaking to the
[2:42:44] marriage couple speaking to the single

[2:44:07] when people look on facebook and want to
[2:44:09] be like other people
[2:44:11] they are just oppressed by what they see
[2:44:14] they don't know the lifestyle they don't
[2:44:15] know what people are going through those
[2:44:18] things just stream out of the internet
[2:44:21] and cast a spirit of oppression of
