[1:00:37] in the power
[1:00:38] of the spirit
[1:00:41] into gathering
[1:00:42] and there went out a friend of him
[1:00:45] throughout all the region
[1:00:47] round about and he taught in the
[1:00:50] ascendants
[1:00:52] being glorified of all
[1:00:56] and he came to nazareth
[1:00:59] where he had been brought up
[1:01:03] and as his custom was he went
[1:01:07] he went into the synagogues on the
[1:01:09] sabbath day
[1:01:11] and stood up
[1:01:13] for to read
[1:01:14] and there was deliver unto him the book
[1:01:18] of the prophet
[1:01:20] desire
[1:01:22] and when he had opened
[1:01:24] the book
[1:01:25] he found the place
[1:01:28] where it is written
[1:01:30] just where we just read
[1:01:32] so jesus went back over to isaiah
[1:01:35] chapter 61. he opened that place where
[1:01:39] it is just read the spirit of the lord

[1:01:59] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:02:01] lord

[1:02:05] book so which means he broke the
[1:02:07] prophecies into two
[1:02:09] he just read one part of the prophecy
[1:02:12] and then he left the other one and he
[1:02:14] closed the book
[1:02:15] and he gave it again to the minister and
[1:02:20] sat down
[1:02:21] and his and the eyes of all them that
[1:02:24] were in the synagogues were fasting on
[1:02:27] him and he began to say unto them this

[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:52] amen the scripture we we just read is is
[1:04:56] very familiar to
[1:04:58] to uh
[1:04:59] to many of us
[1:05:02] praise the lord
[1:05:04] very familiar
[1:05:06] but i read that this morning just just
[1:05:09] to
[1:05:10] uh
[1:05:12] uh create a picture
[1:05:14] or use that as a scripture
[1:05:17] reading because i really didn't have one
[1:05:20] amen
[1:05:22] the reason i didn't have one is because
[1:05:24] uh uh
[1:05:26] there there just there were just a lot
[1:05:28] of things that is before us this morning
[1:05:30] and we want to trust and see how the
[1:05:32] grace of god will be able to bring us
[1:05:35] through those things amen
[1:05:37] praise the lord
[1:05:39] and that wednesday night we had a prayer
[1:05:41] meeting
[1:05:42] and uh
[1:05:44] and just for an exhortation we spoke
[1:05:47] uh how paul
[1:05:49] uh
[1:05:50] referred to the believers and sees
[1:05:52] knowing that that ye are the temple
[1:05:55] of the living god amen
[1:05:57] and where god dwelleth in you we read
[1:06:00] that and then we read also from from the
[1:06:03] book of revelation
[1:06:04] where jesus referred to a certain group
[1:06:07] of men as certain impersonators you know
[1:06:10] these guys were imposters they were uh
[1:06:13] and and jesus referred to them as the
[1:06:16] synagogues of satan
[1:06:18] so we were looking at men being the
[1:06:20] temple of god and men being the
[1:06:22] synagogues of satan
[1:06:24] so uh we were just we were just looking
[1:06:26] at the other uh you know and and that's
[1:06:30] that's the thing about the word of god
[1:06:31] is
[1:06:32] is uh uh
[1:06:34] when you go when you go just stretching
[1:06:36] into one verse you might bomb into an
[1:06:38] entire book
[1:06:40] and then you go reading that book you
[1:06:42] might get into a you know
[1:06:44] one verse might get you into an entire
[1:06:46] chapter the chapter will get you into an
[1:06:48] entire book
[1:06:50] praise the lord so uh
[1:06:52] with that total mind
[1:06:55] we were thinking this morning how
[1:06:57] we will we will come back to that
[1:07:01] and you know and from the world be able
[1:07:03] to show
[1:07:05] you know how we are living in the day of
[1:07:08] manifestation
[1:07:10] we are living in the dead you know god
[1:07:13] god highest form of expression is to be
[1:07:16] made flesh
[1:07:20] praise the lord you know just like we
[1:07:22] spoke about that little baby that is
[1:07:24] that was born killed
[1:07:25] and then a little and after a while he
[1:07:28] started becoming a troubled boy but you
[1:07:30] know what the father waits for is to see
[1:07:33] when he grows to be
[1:07:35] mentioned
[1:07:36] it grows to the age of maturity what he
[1:07:39] would become
[1:07:40] you know he being a little cute baby he
[1:07:43] being a troublesome boy you know he
[1:07:46] being you know that smart teenager will
[1:07:49] matter nothing
[1:07:51] when it comes to that time of his
[1:07:54] maturity
[1:07:59] praise the lord because you see when god
[1:08:02] made man in the beginning god never made
[1:08:05] a baby man
[1:08:07] he never made a teenage boy when he made
[1:08:10] man he made man in a manchester state
[1:08:16] he made him and he adopted him
[1:08:20] and said take dominion
[1:08:25] praise the lord so that is the highest
[1:08:28] form of expression
[1:08:30] when we come to maturity
[1:08:34] praise the lord
[1:08:36] when we comes to maturity
[1:08:38] that's what the father looks for
[1:08:47] are we together
[1:08:49] praise the lord so we are in we are in
[1:08:51] such a time of uh of of of of
[1:08:54] manifestation we we are in an age where
[1:08:57] we we are realizing you know the bible
[1:08:59] the bible speaks about uh you know
[1:09:04] a man of sin the man that would be be
[1:09:07] fully possessed by the devil just like
[1:09:09] jesus christ was god in flesh there will
[1:09:12] be a man that will be fully possessed by
[1:09:14] the spirit of the devil he will be he
[1:09:17] will be satan in flesh amen but but yet
[1:09:20] in in
[1:09:21] and just like our lord jesus christ was
[1:09:23] was god in flesh we are also coming to
[1:09:26] the place where we have we have
[1:09:29] sons and daughters of god that are also
[1:09:32] uh in the embodiment of the spirit of
[1:09:34] god and we also you know living in an
[1:09:37] age where we are seeing uh you know uh
[1:09:40] people that have just been overtaken by
[1:09:43] the devil amen
[1:09:44] praise the lord wickedness and violence
[1:09:47] just just just brewed in their hearts
[1:09:50] and mind what a blood-seeking generation
[1:09:53] that we are living in amen not a day
[1:09:55] that goes by without the blood being
[1:09:58] shared on this earth
[1:09:59] praise the lord
[1:10:00] it's a horrible horrible generation that
[1:10:03] we are living in that's the reason why
[1:10:05] we are grateful that we are christians
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:10] because the most saviors place to be is
[1:10:12] to be in christ
[1:10:14] that is the only savior's place and the
[1:10:17] only future that this world have is the
[1:10:20] coming millennium
[1:10:22] this world does not have no future by
[1:10:24] the coming millennium
[1:10:26] praise the lord
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:28] what jesus will reign
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:32] and satan will be bound for the thousand
[1:10:35] years

[1:13:50] as a set of year
[1:13:53] uh is to
[1:13:55] is to is to show just like how we read
[1:13:59] in isaiah 61
[1:14:02] isaiah the prophet
[1:14:04] prophesied
[1:14:06] about some 6 700 years
[1:14:10] before jesus was born
[1:14:12] he prophesied that the spirit of the
[1:14:15] lord is upon me he spoke in the first
[1:14:18] person
[1:14:20] you know
[1:14:21] he prophesied the spirit of the lord god
[1:14:24] is upon me he have anointed me and and
[1:14:26] he said all of these
[1:14:28] but then
[1:14:30] after 700 plus years here is jesus
[1:14:34] stepping into his ministry
[1:14:37] after coming down from the mountain
[1:14:39] being tempted by the devil the bible
[1:14:41] says he went right into the synagogues
[1:14:46] now you realize that the synagos and the
[1:14:50] temple
[1:14:52] is is used
[1:14:55] in the kind of uh
[1:14:58] interchanging way in the scripture
[1:15:01] sometimes you see the synagogue
[1:15:03] sometimes they see the temple but as i
[1:15:05] had a thought on my mind i decided to to
[1:15:08] go back and and check a little bit and
[1:15:09] see what was the difference between the
[1:15:12] synagogues and the temple the temple
[1:15:14] actually was the place of worship
[1:15:18] it was the place
[1:15:20] of sacrifice like we said on wednesday
[1:15:23] night it's a place of worship it's a
[1:15:25] place it's a sacred place now the the
[1:15:28] the synagogues will be pretty much like
[1:15:32] what we would call the fellowship hall
[1:15:35] it was a place of discussion where
[1:15:37] people
[1:15:38] you know they would sit down they would
[1:15:40] they would talk about scripture they
[1:15:41] would argue
[1:15:42] there was a place where they could also
[1:15:44] be taught
[1:15:46] you know they would sit down and the
[1:15:47] teachers of the lord will come and teach
[1:15:50] them you know so so just like that
[1:15:53] so you'll see it in the scripture
[1:15:56] but it's also
[1:15:58] you know it's also
[1:16:00] amazing that when you look also in the
[1:16:02] bible you will realize that the way
[1:16:05] jesus talked about the temple
[1:16:08] he talked about it with such
[1:16:11] a reverence
[1:16:12] and the way he talks about the
[1:16:14] synagogues
[1:16:16] praise the lord
[1:16:18] he related all
[1:16:20] the
[1:16:21] the you know the
[1:16:23] the
[1:16:24] the evil arts of the pharisees
[1:16:28] you know he says there will come a time
[1:16:29] where there was caution in the in the
[1:16:31] synagogues you know and different things
[1:16:33] he talks about the synagogues but then
[1:16:36] you remember in the scripture where us
[1:16:38] in john chapter 2 where he says destroy
[1:16:41] this temple
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:44] he actually did not point it to himself
[1:16:47] but he was standing right in the in the
[1:16:49] temple in the synagogues and he just
[1:16:51] gave that expression destroy this temple
[1:16:54] and in three days
[1:16:56] i would raise it up
[1:16:59] and the bible says they never knew that
[1:17:01] he was talking about his body
[1:17:06] praise the lord because you see there is
[1:17:08] one there is there is a there is a
[1:17:10] continuity of god's word
[1:17:14] jesus said the scripture cannot be
[1:17:16] broken
[1:17:20] god has expressed from time
[1:17:22] that he do not dwarf in temple made with
[1:17:26] hands
[1:17:30] every temple that was built was just a
[1:17:33] shadow
[1:17:35] god is more interested
[1:17:37] in tabernacling in our body
[1:17:41] than dwelling in this place
[1:17:45] then dwelling in these four walls
[1:17:48] how can you
[1:17:50] cage the great internal spirit
[1:17:53] in the four wall
[1:17:57] he's more interested
[1:18:00] in tabernacling in our body
[1:18:04] praise the lord
[1:18:06] praise the lord
[1:18:08] than just being caged in the building
[1:18:12] he's more interested in you than the
[1:18:15] building
[1:18:17] praise the lord more interested in you
[1:18:20] than your suit
[1:18:21] or your nice dress
[1:18:26] he most interested in you as a person
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:31] then then your looks
[1:18:36] praise the lord so you see there is a
[1:18:38] continuity in the scripture
[1:18:40] even when when david has pressed to to
[1:18:43] build a temple
[1:18:45] god said the same thing to him i've
[1:18:46] never dwelt in temple
[1:18:49] i've always gone from 10 to 10
[1:18:53] from tabernacle to tabernacle
[1:18:57] praise the lord
[1:18:59] so jesus here uh uh coming into his
[1:19:02] ministry the scripture says he went
[1:19:04] right into the synagogues he took the
[1:19:07] book took the straw of the prophet as i
[1:19:10] open it up right to where we read sister
[1:19:13] one and he read a portion of the
[1:19:15] prophecy
[1:19:16] the acceptable year that spoke of his
[1:19:19] first coming he broke the prophecy into
[1:19:22] when he wrote it read about the
[1:19:24] acceptable year the bible says he closed
[1:19:26] the book
[1:19:29] and he said this day
[1:19:33] this scripture that has been read i mean
[1:19:36] i prophesied 700 years ago
[1:19:40] this day
[1:19:42] this scripture
[1:19:44] is fulfilled
[1:19:49] praise the lord
[1:19:50] now so what what i want to do the reason
[1:19:53] why i i read that
[1:19:55] is to is to also
[1:19:57] uh show how
[1:19:59] uh uh actually i kind of forgive myself
[1:20:02] for
[1:20:03] a title year jesus preached the seven
[1:20:05] seals in matthew 24.
[1:20:10] so
[1:20:11] uh
[1:20:13] i was talking with brother mark wilson a
[1:20:15] brother over there in wanona
[1:20:18] yesterday
[1:20:20] uh he's here i think he's following the
[1:20:22] service this morning
[1:20:24] we were talking
[1:20:26] a little bit in
[1:20:28] and then
[1:20:29] talking from one thing to another you
[1:20:31] know just just appreciating the things
[1:20:34] that god is doing in the life of his
[1:20:36] children i mean
[1:20:37] but mac has been uh
[1:20:40] has been living down there for i mean
[1:20:42] almost over
[1:20:44] over 15 years now he's been in winona he
[1:20:47] got a job he flew directly from south
[1:20:49] africa to wanona and uh i mean he's been
[1:20:52] there all of these years and and uh and
[1:20:56] and and keep and holding his faith in
[1:20:59] his heart amen
[1:21:00] you know uh
[1:21:01] fellowshipping with believers and all of
[1:21:04] that so we were just talking on some of
[1:21:05] those things and just to appreciate you
[1:21:08] know how
[1:21:11] god keeps his
[1:21:12] people amen
[1:21:15] how the word of god
[1:21:18] is what keeps us
[1:21:21] we are not the one keeping the word
[1:21:23] is the word that is keeping us
[1:21:28] praise the lord
[1:21:29] and while we were talking about that and
[1:21:30] then and some few things we were talking
[1:21:32] about
[1:21:33] and then we started talking about the
[1:21:35] word condition also
[1:21:37] you know with everything that was that
[1:21:40] is happening around the world you know
[1:21:41] when
[1:21:42] and uh yeah the the
[1:21:44] the the full shortages that that the uh
[1:21:48] wf old is alarming on because of what is
[1:21:52] going on you in ukraine and in all of
[1:21:54] that
[1:21:55] so while we were talking on that and and
[1:21:58] then uh you know a scripture thought
[1:22:00] struck my mind and i was sharing with uh
[1:22:04] uh brett mackin and i told him i said
[1:22:07] you know
[1:22:08] it's it's been like that all through
[1:22:10] scripture
[1:22:11] or true scripture
[1:22:14] you will realize that
[1:22:16] uh
[1:22:17] god
[1:22:19] uh have used
[1:22:21] it's all through the scripture
[1:22:24] the way the bible plays it
[1:22:26] is
[1:22:27] farming
[1:22:28] pestilence
[1:22:30] and swallow
[1:22:32] that is the three whip
[1:22:34] that god always use
[1:22:36] to whip the nations
[1:22:40] praise the lord
[1:22:42] that's god's three whip that he has he
[1:22:45] always use that
[1:22:49] amen
[1:22:50] exodus chapter 5
[1:22:52] verse 3
[1:22:54] and they said the god of heaven has met
[1:22:56] with us
[1:22:58] let us go we pray thee
[1:23:01] three days joining into the desert and
[1:23:04] sacrifice
[1:23:05] unto
[1:23:07] the lord our god leads
[1:23:10] he fought upon us with pestilence and we
[1:23:13] swallowed moses and aaron talking to
[1:23:16] to uh pharaoh and his councilman you
[1:23:19] realize when david number the people
[1:23:22] that that he should not have done
[1:23:26] first chronicle chapter 21 verse 12
[1:23:29] either three years of farming or three
[1:23:32] months
[1:23:34] to be destroyed before thy fall
[1:23:37] while that the swall of thy enemy
[1:23:40] overtake thee or s three days of sward
[1:23:43] or of the lord even the pestilence in
[1:23:47] the land and and you see that uh solomon
[1:23:50] when he prayed in second chronicles
[1:23:52] chapter 20 verse 9
[1:23:54] he says if when evil cometh upon us a
[1:23:57] sword judgment pestilence or farming
[1:24:02] we stand before this house
[1:24:04] and
[1:24:06] in that presence
[1:24:07] for thy name is in this house
[1:24:10] and cry unto thee in our affliction then
[1:24:13] thou shall hear and help
[1:24:16] praise the lord
[1:24:17] you go over to in the book of jeremiah
[1:24:20] and i mean it's just it's all over the
[1:24:22] scripture so god have always used these
[1:24:25] three things
[1:24:27] he's always used these three things as
[1:24:30] as his whip on the nations
[1:24:34] praise the lord
[1:24:36] there's there's that's pestilence which
[1:24:39] is sickness and we have just come out of
[1:24:42] a pestilence which which is a sign of
[1:24:45] judgment the whole coronavirus
[1:24:47] global it was a global whip
[1:24:51] that have crumbled the word economy
[1:24:57] now we're slowly going into into farming
[1:25:00] because uh uh i was just listening to to
[1:25:03] to news and uh uh the wh artist is
[1:25:07] alarming because all of the wheat grain
[1:25:09] that comes out of ukraine now they
[1:25:12] cannot farm because of everything that
[1:25:14] is happening there is creating food
[1:25:16] shortages in europe and some parts of
[1:25:18] africa
[1:25:23] praise the
[1:25:24] lord
[1:25:26] and and the next one is swall which is
[1:25:29] uh which is war
[1:25:32] now so uh
[1:25:34] you will
[1:25:36] you appreciate this as we as we go as we
[1:25:38] get into what we want to talk about here
[1:25:41] now so we were talking on that uh even
[1:25:44] though i had i had something on my mind
[1:25:46] so as soon as we got through talking i
[1:25:48] was right here in my office studying i
[1:25:50] just went back into i said well that's
[1:25:53] that's a beautiful thing we just talked
[1:25:54] about right now
[1:25:56] i said i said lord okay let me let me
[1:25:58] just look into that and and kind of for
[1:26:01] looking into that then i came up with
[1:26:02] with uh
[1:26:05] you know i came up with what what we
[1:26:07] want to talk about this morning now so
[1:26:11] especially with all of these things that
[1:26:13] is happening in and you know and and and
[1:26:15] the entire world is alarming could this
[1:26:18] be world war three you know what ukraine
[1:26:21] you know everybody is salami and and and
[1:26:24] as soon as those things start to alarm
[1:26:27] uh uh the christian world the first
[1:26:29] place that people fall on is matthew
[1:26:31] chapter 24.
[1:26:33] the bible says there will be wars and
[1:26:35] romance of wars
[1:26:37] you know
[1:26:38] when people quick to fall back on
[1:26:40] matthew chapter 24.
[1:26:42] so this morning
[1:26:44] i will i would i would want us to just
[1:26:46] to just uh uh
[1:26:49] you know just study together a little
[1:26:51] bit
[1:26:52] praise the lord
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:59] and uh you know i will i will i would
[1:27:02] want to take the liberty you know
[1:27:04] and and try to establish the church a
[1:27:07] little bit
[1:27:08] in some of the uh present truth amen
[1:27:12] of what is happening around us and and
[1:27:14] just to bring it out of the light of
[1:27:16] god's word this morning because that
[1:27:18] that is that's the responsibility of the
[1:27:21] of the local pastor you know brother
[1:27:23] branham says here in uh in uh in the
[1:27:25] message adoption he says bible teaching
[1:27:29] is usually a little treacherous a little
[1:27:32] you know a kind of walking
[1:27:35] out on a thin ice
[1:27:38] he said we call it that way
[1:27:40] but
[1:27:41] we just feel that maybe
[1:27:44] at this point
[1:27:46] and at this time it might be a good
[1:27:49] you know a good to kind of bring the
[1:27:52] church
[1:27:53] what is a complete understanding
[1:27:54] positionally of what we are in
[1:27:58] in christ jesus
[1:28:01] and sometimes i think their preaching is
[1:28:04] wonderful it's a wonderful thing but i
[1:28:06] believe you know
[1:28:08] calling the brother their brother biller
[1:28:10] that teaching
[1:28:12] goes beyond that especially to the
[1:28:15] church
[1:28:16] now
[1:28:17] preaching usually catch the sinner
[1:28:21] and but uh
[1:28:23] it brings him on a condemnation by the
[1:28:26] word but teaching place the man
[1:28:29] positioning what he is
[1:28:32] you see and that's the reason why is the
[1:28:34] pastor's responsibility
[1:28:36] you know
[1:28:37] that's that's his responsibility to to
[1:28:40] be able to positionally place the church
[1:28:43] establish the church you see that's the
[1:28:45] reason why the efficient church
[1:28:48] you know broadband called it the more
[1:28:50] mature church why because paul spent
[1:28:53] more time with that
[1:28:54] church than any of the other churches
[1:29:02] and so he were able to establish the
[1:29:04] people
[1:29:05] right from the mind of god
[1:29:08] right from ephesians chapter one talking
[1:29:10] about you know god right you know god
[1:29:13] have choosing us from the mind of god
[1:29:15] and bringing us right into our human
[1:29:17] family and bringing us into the church
[1:29:19] and placing us under the fightful
[1:29:21] ministry you know and i mean he he i
[1:29:24] mean the efficient church was just a
[1:29:26] solid church because he was always there
[1:29:29] to establish the people
[1:29:33] praise the lord
[1:29:35] so we want to do just a little bit of
[1:29:37] that this morning
[1:29:38] with everything that is happening so
[1:29:40] what i'm going to do i'm i'm going to
[1:29:43] take a great thought from uh the sixth
[1:29:45] year you know uh where the
[1:29:48] uh uh brett branham is placing uh this
[1:29:52] whole matthew chapter 24 because you see
[1:29:55] matthew chapter 24 on the on the
[1:29:58] prophecy it has it has a great element
[1:30:02] that relates with revelation chapter 6.
[1:30:09] praise the lord
[1:30:11] it has a great element that relates
[1:30:14] with revelation chapter 6.
[1:30:18] are we together
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:21] and you see the uh uh
[1:30:24] uh just like we shared with you before
[1:30:27] uh uh
[1:30:28] god
[1:30:29] there with the prophet daniel
[1:30:32] revealing to him now you have to realize
[1:30:35] when god was dealing with dania they
[1:30:37] were in captivity in babylon
[1:30:40] praise the lord
[1:30:42] and babylon was a gentile
[1:30:45] nation
[1:30:47] so god
[1:30:48] will first deal with the king
[1:30:52] nebuchadnezzar
[1:30:54] in a dream that he that he don't
[1:30:56] understand
[1:30:58] but that dream
[1:30:59] will represent
[1:31:01] the gentile kingdom
[1:31:04] praise the lord
[1:31:06] amen it will represent the gentile
[1:31:09] kingdom how god will deal with the
[1:31:12] gentile kingdom from the babylonian
[1:31:14] kingdom which was the head of gold
[1:31:18] down to the roman kingdom where we are
[1:31:21] now living in
[1:31:22] amen
[1:31:24] they have just changed from from pagan
[1:31:27] room to papa rome
[1:31:30] praise the lord
[1:31:32] amen it has its embassy all around the
[1:31:35] world in the name of the roman catholic
[1:31:36] church
[1:31:40] now so he will show and and and then
[1:31:44] jesus would come and tell us
[1:31:48] when he used that phrase until the the
[1:31:51] times of the gentile be fulfilled so
[1:31:53] there is a there is a period of time a
[1:31:56] dispensation of time that has been cut
[1:31:59] off called the times of the gentiles
[1:32:05] praise the lord
[1:32:06] so god will show that to nebuchadnezzar
[1:32:10] in a dream but there will be a prophet
[1:32:13] down here on the land to interpret that
[1:32:15] dream
[1:32:17] praise the lord
[1:32:18] now in the midst of uh of of of the the
[1:32:23] understanding of that dream because god
[1:32:25] is showing to daniel that the the the
[1:32:28] the babylonian kingdom the kingdom of
[1:32:30] the midst and and pressure the greek
[1:32:33] kingdom you know uh uh uh you know
[1:32:36] showing him all all of this kingdom
[1:32:39] you know and uh but then dania also is
[1:32:43] trouble
[1:32:44] and he's asking the lord what will
[1:32:46] become of my people
[1:32:49] i'm seeing all of these things and it's
[1:32:51] concerning the gentiles
[1:32:54] so he's becoming trouble
[1:32:56] what will become of my people
[1:33:00] praise the lord
[1:33:01] so in the midst of that dealing
[1:33:05] daniel
[1:33:06] is praying you know that's that's when
[1:33:08] he put his heart to pray
[1:33:11] and and and and then the angel came and
[1:33:14] said from the time you started praying
[1:33:15] your answer was on the way but the
[1:33:17] prince of pesha you know stood against
[1:33:20] me and micah the angel have to come and
[1:33:22] help me now so yeah uh
[1:33:25] uh uh uh the lord now
[1:33:28] gave down there a breathing
[1:33:32] that in this time of the gentiles
[1:33:35] when this time is fulfilled there will
[1:33:37] be a period of time
[1:33:40] that is called the seventh week
[1:33:47] amen
[1:33:48] and in that 70 week that's when your
[1:33:51] messiah
[1:33:54] will come for the offering of sins
[1:33:57] praise the lord
[1:33:58] so he laid that out to down here
[1:34:03] praise the lord
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:06] but then he told daniel he says
[1:34:09] seal the book
[1:34:11] see those things because those things
[1:34:14] are for the
[1:34:16] end are we together
[1:34:22] praise the lord
[1:34:24] so you see we we are not we are not
[1:34:27] living in a world
[1:34:29] that is just run by wall street
[1:34:32] wall street do not run the world
[1:34:36] praise the lord they only manage
[1:34:38] the fine eyes of the business people
[1:34:42] it does not run the word
[1:34:48] the creator of the universe
[1:34:50] runs his universe
[1:34:55] praise the lord
[1:34:57] and he has laid it out
[1:35:00] in times and seasons
[1:35:03] how these things will happen
[1:35:11] praise the lord
[1:35:15] that's why we believe that uh uh
[1:35:19] you know the
[1:35:20] uh nothing is going to happen to us
[1:35:22] until god's purpose in our life is
[1:35:25] fulfilled
[1:35:27] praise the lord
[1:35:30] amen
[1:35:33] do you remember in the scripture that it
[1:35:35] was a time of farming
[1:35:37] you know where god had to use raven to
[1:35:39] feel a prophet
[1:35:42] amen
[1:35:43] he had to use raving to feed a prophet
[1:35:47] he had to send that prophet over to meet
[1:35:49] a widow woman that would give
[1:35:51] him the last meal
[1:35:54] for she and her son to eat
[1:35:57] but then that would begin the revival in
[1:35:59] that home
[1:36:01] that the oil will not go dry the the the
[1:36:05] flower bed will not go empty
[1:36:07] until
[1:36:10] because god runs the universe
[1:36:14] amen
[1:36:15] one million people
[1:36:20] or more in the wilderness
[1:36:23] with moses
[1:36:26] there is no walmart
[1:36:29] there are no walgreens
[1:36:32] and babies are born
[1:36:35] babies are born the people the the the
[1:36:39] generation that entered the wilderness
[1:36:41] were the children that were born in the
[1:36:42] wilderness
[1:36:44] the the generation that entered the
[1:36:45] promised land were the children that
[1:36:47] were born in the wilderness babies are
[1:36:49] born there is no maternity center
[1:36:56] can you think about that
[1:37:01] no warmer for them to go shopping
[1:37:07] and the scripture says their clothes
[1:37:10] never were out
[1:37:13] to get old
[1:37:14] neither the shoes on their feet
[1:37:20] praise the lord
[1:37:24] so which means god
[1:37:26] can even sustain
[1:37:30] the natural the material things that
[1:37:32] belongs to his children
[1:37:36] praise the lord
[1:37:40] amen
[1:37:46] you think it's only because you you uh
[1:37:48] you change your oil after every three
[1:37:51] months
[1:37:53] or you go to the market you think that's
[1:37:54] what is keeping your car going
[1:37:57] every time you stand behind that staring
[1:37:59] and say lord i'm about to get on the
[1:38:00] road bless this vehicle
[1:38:04] and bless every mechanical part
[1:38:07] [Laughter]
[1:38:10] god is able to sustain even the material
[1:38:13] things
[1:38:14] that pertains to his children
[1:38:19] that the god we serve
[1:38:29] are we together
[1:38:31] now so we see here that uh
[1:38:34] uh uh we we we want to take we want to
[1:38:37] take this joining a little bit
[1:38:39] and uh and trust that the law will will
[1:38:42] come and bless us together
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:49] praise the lord
[1:38:52] now so uh the bible speaks here
[1:38:56] uh uh let's let's go over to the book of
[1:38:59] uh uh matthew chapter 24.
[1:39:04] there are few things that that caught my
[1:39:06] attention
[1:39:08] this will take us down
[1:39:11] to talking on the seals
[1:39:13] in revelation chapter 6
[1:39:16] where the bible
[1:39:17] speaks about the seals but i don't want
[1:39:19] to get so much there into the teaching
[1:39:21] of the seals because it would not be
[1:39:24] fair to just start something and don't
[1:39:26] continue about it but i want to just
[1:39:28] grab your attention to to some so some
[1:39:30] few things that are very important
[1:39:33] trusting that the holy spirit will use
[1:39:34] that and bless you
[1:39:36] amen
[1:39:37] something will be said that will draw
[1:39:39] you closer to the lord
[1:39:41] make you to rededicate your life and
[1:39:44] and
[1:39:45] and serve the lord amen
[1:39:50] now so
[1:39:52] one of the one of the striking things
[1:39:54] here
[1:39:55] uh as we as we begin is to look at this
[1:39:58] scripture
[1:40:00] matthew chapter 24 the bible says and
[1:40:03] jesus went out and departed from the
[1:40:06] temple
[1:40:08] he went out and he departed from the
[1:40:10] temple
[1:40:11] and his disciple came to him
[1:40:14] to show him
[1:40:16] the building of the temple
[1:40:18] praise the lord
[1:40:20] now you have to realize also that that
[1:40:22] temple was built by herod
[1:40:26] and
[1:40:27] and uh and and and herod was serving on
[1:40:30] the the roman government
[1:40:34] and
[1:40:37] if you look in the scripture also and
[1:40:39] you trace
[1:40:41] you know the the
[1:40:43] the the birth line of herald you will
[1:40:46] realize that
[1:40:48] he's uh
[1:40:50] he's he's from uh
[1:40:52] edomite
[1:40:55] the group that comes from there
[1:40:57] now you will see that uh even even our
[1:41:00] lord jesus christ one time when he talks
[1:41:02] about him he said he was a fox
[1:41:07] and sometimes it looks like you know uh
[1:41:10] uh but there's there's a whole thing
[1:41:12] there if i just
[1:41:14] going through all of that i would lost
[1:41:16] my time here so the disciples is showing
[1:41:19] jesus the temple now you have to keep in
[1:41:21] mind now we're going to talking about
[1:41:23] the temple and the synagogues
[1:41:26] uh the temple of god and the synagogues
[1:41:29] of satan yes so would like to close with
[1:41:32] that talk
[1:41:34] now so you see here they show jesus the
[1:41:37] temple and jesus said unto them
[1:41:40] see in that all these things
[1:41:43] verily i say unto you
[1:41:47] there shall not be left here one stone
[1:41:50] upon another
[1:41:52] thou shalt not be thrown down
[1:41:55] praise the lord
[1:41:57] let's go a little bit in the minds of
[1:41:59] these disciples seeing the ministry of
[1:42:01] jesus the the healing ministry and the
[1:42:03] things that he's doing
[1:42:05] they start to to nurse in their mind
[1:42:08] this is the messiah then and we saw that
[1:42:10] in acts chapter one how they express or
[1:42:14] look in the book of luke that they were
[1:42:16] thinking that this is the time they will
[1:42:18] be delivered from the roman you know uh
[1:42:21] uh government or the roman rule
[1:42:24] and now they are showing him the temple
[1:42:26] and now he's telling them that there
[1:42:28] will not be one stone that would be left
[1:42:30] upon another
[1:42:31] i believe it kind of apostle them in
[1:42:33] their mind why is he saying this you
[1:42:36] know why is he saying this
[1:42:39] and the scripture says and as they sat
[1:42:42] upon man olive the disciple came unto
[1:42:45] him privately
[1:42:46] saying tell us
[1:42:48] when shall these things be
[1:42:50] and what shall be the son of uh thy
[1:42:53] coming and of the end of the world so
[1:42:55] three questions they give to jesus
[1:42:58] praise the lord
[1:43:00] three questions so as jesus go about to
[1:43:03] talk about everything
[1:43:05] in
[1:43:06] in that chapter he's addressing these
[1:43:09] three questions
[1:43:11] praise the lord
[1:43:13] amen it's just sometimes uh uh you know
[1:43:16] we need uh
[1:43:18] an ego eye to be able to tell us which
[1:43:21] verse pertains to which question
[1:43:24] and that's why we want to do a little
[1:43:25] bit this morning
[1:43:27] because
[1:43:28] just like isaiah 61
[1:43:31] jesus is saying this
[1:43:33] but we will realize that in revelation
[1:43:37] chapter 17
[1:43:39] jesus noun is going to in his future
[1:43:42] ministry he is now going to be showing
[1:43:45] john by a prophet ministry the
[1:43:49] fulfillment of this of everything here
[1:43:51] in in uh
[1:43:53] uh
[1:43:55] matthew chapter 24.
[1:43:58] so jesus spoke
[1:44:00] he's sitting there with his disciple see
[1:44:03] see all of these things that be now one
[1:44:05] stone left upon another and then he
[1:44:07] starts to narrate to them and and and
[1:44:10] jesus answered and said take heed
[1:44:13] that no man deceive you
[1:44:16] for
[1:44:18] many shall come in my name saying i am
[1:44:20] the christ and they shall deceive many
[1:44:23] and he goes on and he's saying this
[1:44:25] thing they are sitting there on man
[1:44:27] olive
[1:44:28] and they are listening to him
[1:44:30] praise the lord but as they are
[1:44:32] listening to him it is a closed book
[1:44:38] they are just hearing what he's saying
[1:44:41] but they are not understanding it
[1:44:46] they cannot put them in it's just like
[1:44:49] when isaiah said the spirit of the lord
[1:44:51] god is upon me he have anointed me it
[1:44:54] took jesus to come
[1:44:56] open the very same scripture
[1:44:58] and said this day
[1:45:02] this scripture
[1:45:04] is fulfilled
[1:45:08] so when he says that what happens
[1:45:11] the bible says every i
[1:45:14] was fasting upon him
[1:45:18] because he spoke with such an authority
[1:45:22] and the world was so anointed
[1:45:24] that people said really
[1:45:27] now it builds expectation for people now
[1:45:31] to start seeing the blind eyes open
[1:45:35] for people now to start seeing that the
[1:45:37] captain being set free
[1:45:40] why because the world has not come alive
[1:45:48] when as i have said it anybody can read
[1:45:50] it i mean the prophets the the priests
[1:45:52] threw out the ages they read it and
[1:45:54] everybody could give their
[1:45:56] interpretation of what it mean
[1:45:59] but when jesus came he said this day
[1:46:04] this scripture
[1:46:09] is fulfilled
[1:46:11] in matthew chapter 24
[1:46:14] he's he's talking in uh uh in the book
[1:46:17] of mark would tell us that it was peter
[1:46:20] james john and andrews
[1:46:22] those were the four that was with
[1:46:25] uh
[1:46:26] this is called the
[1:46:28] mind of all his discourse that's that's
[1:46:30] how the
[1:46:31] the theologians term it
[1:46:33] uh uh but there there there's the reason
[1:46:36] why we want to go down this road this
[1:46:38] morning is just to be able to
[1:46:40] to uh
[1:46:42] to help us to appreciate
[1:46:45] the ministry that has come to us in this
[1:46:47] age
[1:46:49] and to to show you that we're now
[1:46:51] following
[1:46:52] conan's divine feebles of men
[1:46:56] praise the lord
[1:46:58] amen
[1:47:03] just like the bible says
[1:47:05] in the beginning the spirit of god
[1:47:08] move upon the water
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:13] one day in nazareth
[1:47:16] the spirit of god
[1:47:18] was in a body called jesus
[1:47:22] praise the lord
[1:47:23] if the spirit of god could move upon the
[1:47:26] water
[1:47:28] if that spirit is in a body it will walk
[1:47:30] upon the water
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:33] because it's the same god
[1:47:38] praise the lord
[1:47:40] now when jesus was walking upon the
[1:47:43] water all he was trying to grab the the
[1:47:46] apostle attention is the same goal that
[1:47:50] moved in the beginning
[1:47:52] praise the lord
[1:47:53] this is the same god that is now in the
[1:47:56] amis
[1:47:59] if he can walk on the water what would
[1:48:02] be difficult for him to say peace be
[1:48:04] still
[1:48:05] and the wind and the way will obey him
[1:48:08] because he is the same god
[1:48:13] amen
[1:48:16] praise the lord
[1:48:18] so you see it it's just like when you
[1:48:20] read the word and you read god's promise
[1:48:24] that promise is not to stay in the book
[1:48:29] god is trying to show you that if i
[1:48:31] spoke it yet i can bring it to pass
[1:48:34] if you really watch out it's going to
[1:48:36] happen
[1:48:41] amen
[1:48:45] praise the lord
[1:48:46] so jesus
[1:48:48] here he's talking to the disciples
[1:48:54] praise the lord
[1:48:56] five of them
[1:48:59] he and four disciples sitting and he's
[1:49:01] telling them all of the sick he no man
[1:49:02] deceive you and and and and and here
[1:49:06] shall hear walls and rumors of walls
[1:49:08] you know and and
[1:49:11] that ye be not trouble for all of these
[1:49:13] things must come to pass
[1:49:15] but the end is not yet
[1:49:18] praise the lord
[1:49:19] a nation shall rise against nation
[1:49:21] kingdom against kingdom
[1:49:23] and uh
[1:49:25] but you see the the the the the question
[1:49:29] of the disciples
[1:49:31] was to jesus is tell us
[1:49:34] tell us
[1:49:36] when shall these things be
[1:49:42] amen
[1:49:45] when is it going to be
[1:49:48] where there will not be one stone left
[1:49:49] upon another
[1:49:52] praise the lord
[1:49:54] now but as us
[1:49:56] as as our lord
[1:49:59] knew also
[1:50:01] that these things
[1:50:03] were
[1:50:04] were laid out
[1:50:06] in
[1:50:07] in dispensation
[1:50:10] praise the lord
[1:50:11] amen
[1:50:13] so he goes on and he tells the disciples
[1:50:16] you know and nation shall rise against
[1:50:19] nation there will be
[1:50:21] there will be uh
[1:50:22] kingdom against kingdom and there shall
[1:50:25] be farming pestilence
[1:50:28] earthquake
[1:50:29] in davos places
[1:50:31] right here in verse seven again we see
[1:50:33] those three waves nation rise against
[1:50:36] nation the scripture put it right there
[1:50:38] because that's the way that god whips
[1:50:40] the nations
[1:50:42] and
[1:50:44] and and all these things are the
[1:50:46] beginning of sorrow
[1:50:50] then
[1:50:51] shall they deliver you
[1:50:53] now that verse 9
[1:50:57] changed the cause of thoughts
[1:51:02] it changed the cost of thoughts
[1:51:04] let's go a little bit maybe the the
[1:51:07] technicians can be able to help us uh uh
[1:51:11] for some reason uh uh
[1:51:13] kind of left out some of my notes
[1:51:16] but what i have yet is enough to be able
[1:51:18] to set us in our path amen
[1:51:21] the sexual brethren says now let let's
[1:51:24] look to the book of uh the matthew 24
[1:51:27] chapter
[1:51:28] the lamb himself speaking
[1:51:31] praise the lord
[1:51:33] in matthew
[1:51:34] chapter 24 it was jesus
[1:51:37] speaking
[1:51:39] in revelation chapter 6
[1:51:42] it was the lamb who is the lamb of god
[1:51:44] jesus christ
[1:51:48] are we together
[1:51:54] the lamb himself speaking now anyone
[1:51:57] knows that
[1:51:58] christ is the authority
[1:52:02] of
[1:52:03] the whole book
[1:52:07] as far as that concern
[1:52:11] but this his speech here
[1:52:14] his semen to the people all right to the
[1:52:17] jews talking to those
[1:52:19] four jewish believers
[1:52:25] now i want you to hold the book of
[1:52:26] revelation uh matthew 24 in revelation
[1:52:29] chapter 6.
[1:52:30] and let's compare something
[1:52:32] just here a little bit
[1:52:36] and jesus went out and he departed from
[1:52:38] the temple just what we have just read
[1:52:41] and he came to him to show him the
[1:52:43] building of the temple and said unto him
[1:52:45] see
[1:52:46] yeah not all of these things verily i
[1:52:48] say unto you there shall not be one left
[1:52:52] be left ear one stoned upon another that
[1:52:55] shall not be thrown them now verse 3
[1:52:59] as they sat
[1:53:01] among olive the disciples came to him
[1:53:03] privately saying tell us
[1:53:05] tell us
[1:53:07] when
[1:53:08] these things shall be what shall be the
[1:53:10] sign of that coming and of the end of
[1:53:12] the world
[1:53:13] now let's stop here
[1:53:16] these three verse
[1:53:18] three verses
[1:53:19] it took place
[1:53:21] actually
[1:53:23] on tuesday afternoon
[1:53:26] amen
[1:53:29] april the 4th
[1:53:34] 80
[1:53:35] 30.
[1:53:39] and the first two verse took place
[1:53:42] on
[1:53:43] the afternoon
[1:53:46] of april fourth
[1:53:48] eddie thirteen
[1:53:50] and the terror verse took place
[1:53:53] on tuesday evening
[1:53:56] of the same day
[1:54:01] so with this date we can say this day
[1:54:05] this scripture
[1:54:07] is fulfilled
[1:54:13] are we together
[1:54:28] now actually
[1:54:30] what is happening here is that
[1:54:33] uh
[1:54:34] he's giving the date
[1:54:37] of
[1:54:38] the
[1:54:40] the discus
[1:54:44] because we know that
[1:54:48] the temple was destroyed
[1:54:50] in 80
[1:54:52] 70.
[1:54:57] okay
[1:54:58] it's important to keep that in mind
[1:55:01] because you will realize that
[1:55:07] from this date to ad70
[1:55:10] will be exactly 40 years
[1:55:18] the lord
[1:55:19] so
[1:55:20] from the time that jesus is saying this
[1:55:24] to the time where
[1:55:27] titus
[1:55:29] will income about israel i mean
[1:55:32] jerusalem
[1:55:34] will be 40 years
[1:55:38] and
[1:55:42] that that was also the exact amount of
[1:55:46] time it took them to go round about in
[1:55:48] the wilderness
[1:55:53] the reason why is important
[1:55:56] is because
[1:56:04] all of this happened around the same
[1:56:06] time
[1:56:08] when jesus
[1:56:10] looked at the fig tree and said no man
[1:56:12] we eat of thee
[1:56:17] he says no man eater of thee
[1:56:20] and peter and the rest did not honest to
[1:56:23] what he was saying
[1:56:24] but when he came back the tree was dry
[1:56:30] so in that very same time
[1:56:34] he was speaking life out of israel
[1:56:43] which means israel as a nation they will
[1:56:46] they will they will wander just like
[1:56:48] their father wandered in the wilderness
[1:56:51] they would wonder and wonder and wander
[1:56:53] and wander
[1:56:56] are we together
[1:57:04] praise the lord amen
[1:57:07] now let's let's go on a little bit
[1:57:09] there's there's a little bit of too much
[1:57:11] reading here so
[1:57:12] uh
[1:57:15] but i need to take my time so you you
[1:57:17] understand me
[1:57:19] now watch the first seal is revelation
[1:57:23] chapter 6 1.
[1:57:26] and that's what is in revelation chapter
[1:57:28] 6 1. you can write it down and you read
[1:57:30] it and i saw the lamb when he had opened
[1:57:34] one of the seals
[1:57:38] i heard as it was a noise of thunder
[1:57:42] and one of the four beasts said come and
[1:57:46] see
[1:57:49] and i saw in and behold a white house
[1:57:52] rather
[1:57:53] and he that sat on him
[1:57:56] had a ball
[1:57:58] and a crown was given unto him
[1:58:01] and he went for conquering and to
[1:58:04] conquer
[1:58:07] who did we find that fellow was
[1:58:10] it was the antichrist
[1:58:12] praise the lord
[1:58:14] but if you drop back to matthew chapter
[1:58:16] 24
[1:58:17] jesus answered them
[1:58:20] when he started answering them he said
[1:58:24] unto them take heed
[1:58:26] that no man deceive you
[1:58:30] praise the lord
[1:58:31] he was talking to them when he uh when
[1:58:34] he started they asked him when would
[1:58:35] this be and all of that in verses the
[1:58:38] first thing he said to them take he
[1:58:41] no man deceive you
[1:58:44] what was the first event
[1:58:46] of the seal a deceiver
[1:58:50] going with a board and no arrow
[1:58:57] praise the lord
[1:58:59] amen
[1:59:01] now so jesus
[1:59:04] saying this year to them
[1:59:08] but also
[1:59:10] coming revealing that
[1:59:11] he served the prophet
[1:59:14] to it to john in the island of the pa of
[1:59:17] apartments
[1:59:20] are you seeing the parallel
[1:59:22] that was the first thing that he said to
[1:59:24] them now the thing did about uh that is
[1:59:28] that is surrounding this entire subject
[1:59:31] of the seals
[1:59:32] that makes it important
[1:59:35] for us is that
[1:59:37] we talked about as we were talking about
[1:59:39] the the white house rather the the rare
[1:59:42] horse rather the black horse rather the
[1:59:44] pill horse rather all of those things
[1:59:47] are the events
[1:59:52] all of those things are the events that
[1:59:55] happen when the seal is open
[2:00:00] but what is the seal
[2:00:03] who is the seal
[2:00:06] the seal is christ
[2:00:12] amen
[2:00:15] now
[2:00:16] take this thought
[2:00:18] as students of the world
[2:00:20] problem says when adam fell
[2:00:24] the title d went in the hands of the
[2:00:27] original owner
[2:00:32] praise the lord
[2:00:33] amen
[2:00:36] the title the the right to live forever
[2:00:42] praise the lord
[2:00:43] the right to never be sick again
[2:00:48] it went back in the hands of the
[2:00:49] original owner
[2:00:51] so in one sense
[2:00:54] the the deception in the garden of eden
[2:00:57] the the sin of our first parents
[2:01:01] is still christ
[2:01:03] that's the reason why
[2:01:06] two cherubim was put to the tree of life
[2:01:12] so in that sense it's a seal christ now
[2:01:16] was sealed man will never lay forever
[2:01:21] god said by the sweat of your brown
[2:01:25] you eat
[2:01:27] and unto the woman by conception
[2:01:30] in pains you will bring full life to the
[2:01:32] earth
[2:01:36] are we together
[2:01:40] so you see
[2:01:41] that's what make christ is the seal
[2:01:45] what we are seeing or we will see in the
[2:01:47] book of revelation of revelation chapter
[2:01:49] 6 the explanation those are the events
[2:01:55] those are the events
[2:02:00] so here he starts and say take heed no
[2:02:04] man deceive you
[2:02:06] and in revelation chapter 6 verse 1 when
[2:02:09] the first seal was opened
[2:02:12] who we see coming a deceiver
[2:02:17] praise the lord
[2:02:19] amen
[2:02:22] you know why this is important
[2:02:26] because according to revelation 10
[2:02:30] this is our message
[2:02:34] without the opening of the seal we don't
[2:02:36] have a message
[2:02:39] we will be like ammon protestant church
[2:02:42] or any pentecostal church
[2:02:45] that was just prop will just be probing
[2:02:48] guessing
[2:02:49] at the word of god
[2:02:52] when the seals opened it brought us
[2:02:55] divine interpretation
[2:03:04] praise the lord amen
[2:03:08] that's the reason why we we can't just
[2:03:10] guess our scripture well i think it
[2:03:12] means no
[2:03:18] it must not be what you think because
[2:03:20] life is not in your thinking
[2:03:24] life is in god's word
[2:03:26] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:03:29] every word that proceed from the mouth
[2:03:31] of god shall the man live
[2:03:38] amen are we together
[2:03:42] so you see how the comparison went so we
[2:03:44] see here when the first seal was open we
[2:03:47] see a deceiver
[2:03:49] an antichrist he had a ball he had a
[2:03:51] crown on his head but he never had no
[2:03:54] arrow he can never strike
[2:03:58] he's just on the house
[2:04:00] intimidating the people
[2:04:03] but he can't strike
[2:04:06] he's just a bluff
[2:04:08] [Laughter]
[2:04:11] praise the lord
[2:04:13] amen
[2:04:15] oh with your tiny muscle of faith
[2:04:20] you can kick him off of his hearse
[2:04:23] if you just stand on the name of jesus
[2:04:25] christ with your tiny little uh muscle
[2:04:29] of faith
[2:04:30] praise the lord
[2:04:32] i don't care what kind of a demon it is
[2:04:36] if you would just stand because with the
[2:04:38] word of god you have the arrow
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:43] the word is the arrow that cannot miss
[2:04:46] is sharper than the two edges sword
[2:04:54] so jesus said
[2:04:56] be not deceived
[2:04:58] be not deceived don't be carried about
[2:05:01] with our appearance
[2:05:05] look for the word
[2:05:07] because the word has the arrow
[2:05:17] praise the
[2:05:18] lord
[2:05:20] oh my
[2:05:22] the word is becoming sweet
[2:05:25] praise the lord
[2:05:27] amen
[2:05:31] i'm not enjoying it because i'm
[2:05:32] preaching i'm enjoying it because it's
[2:05:34] enjoyable
[2:05:37] what i'm preaching or not i enjoy it
[2:05:41] glory be to god
[2:05:43] hallelujah
[2:05:46] now so we we go ahead if i would just
[2:05:48] keep this bible to the page where it's
[2:05:50] supposed to be
[2:05:53] and not keep closing and open it i will
[2:05:55] be faster
[2:05:57] praise the lord
[2:05:59] verse 5 jesus went on in matthew 24
[2:06:03] he says for many shall come in my name
[2:06:06] saying i am the christ
[2:06:08] and shall deceive many
[2:06:12] now how many
[2:06:15] theologians have interpreted
[2:06:19] that that was christ
[2:06:21] because he was on a white house
[2:06:26] if you read many of the commentary on
[2:06:28] the book of revelation chapter 6 they
[2:06:30] said that was christ
[2:06:33] all because he's on a white house
[2:06:40] amen
[2:06:42] because of that
[2:06:46] glory be to god
[2:06:54] oh praise the lord
[2:07:14] how would you get it
[2:07:25] there's something that crossed my mind
[2:07:26] yeah
[2:07:37] okay let's go up let's go ahead i'll get
[2:07:39] to it
[2:07:44] but we know it was not christ
[2:07:47] we know it was the antichrist
[2:07:50] because jesus in matthew chapter 24
[2:07:52] identified as a deceiving spirit
[2:07:55] and then in revelation chapter 6 it has
[2:07:58] a board it does not have an arrow
[2:08:04] verse 6
[2:08:05] and years a year of wars in
[2:08:09] romans of wars
[2:08:12] see that year being that trouble
[2:08:15] for all these things
[2:08:17] must come to pass
[2:08:19] by the
[2:08:20] end it's not yet
[2:08:23] praise the lord
[2:08:25] verse 7
[2:08:28] a nation shall rise against nation
[2:08:31] amen
[2:08:38] now uh let's let's i will let's let's
[2:08:40] take this other part of the note it
[2:08:42] brings out
[2:08:43] uh
[2:08:45] revelation chapter
[2:08:46] 3
[2:08:48] 6 3 on the on the second seal
[2:08:52] which of course is addressed that in
[2:08:54] verse six
[2:08:58] now the second seal matthew 24
[2:09:01] revelation
[2:09:02] 6 three and four
[2:09:06] i i just i took these calls together and
[2:09:09] just work on it in a way that it would
[2:09:11] be easy for us to read and follow
[2:09:13] through now watch matthew 24 says now
[2:09:16] let let let me see what it says he says
[2:09:19] initial yellow walls and romance of wall
[2:09:21] and be in that trouble for all these
[2:09:23] things must come to pass but the end is
[2:09:25] not yet all right let's see what uh uh
[2:09:29] let's take
[2:09:30] the second seal revelation 6 3
[2:09:33] watch
[2:09:35] he says now and when he have opened
[2:09:38] when he have opened
[2:09:40] the second seal
[2:09:43] praise the lord
[2:09:47] he says i heard
[2:09:49] the second beast said come and see
[2:09:52] and there went for another
[2:09:55] hearse
[2:09:56] that was red
[2:09:59] and power was given unto him
[2:10:02] that sat there on
[2:10:05] to take peace
[2:10:07] from the earth
[2:10:10] and here in matthew chapter 4 jesus says
[2:10:13] walls and romans of wars
[2:10:18] and there the second horse rather is
[2:10:21] taking peace
[2:10:23] from the earth
[2:10:26] he's beginning to trouble all the
[2:10:28] governments
[2:10:30] beginning to trouble all the political
[2:10:32] leaders and causing unrest
[2:10:35] all over
[2:10:39] and that they should kill one another
[2:10:43] and there was giving unto him
[2:10:46] a great
[2:10:48] soul
[2:10:49] so you see the soul comes there
[2:10:52] in chapter in in verse 3
[2:10:55] and then if you go down again to the
[2:10:57] next you will see the pestilence in the
[2:10:59] farming
[2:11:02] so it's it's all there the
[2:11:05] walls and rumors of walls
[2:11:08] and
[2:11:09] and the nation shall rise against nation
[2:11:11] kingdom against kingdom
[2:11:13] and there shall be farming and
[2:11:16] pestilence and earthquake in davos
[2:11:19] places
[2:11:21] all of these
[2:11:23] are the beginning
[2:11:25] of sorrows
[2:11:29] praise the lord
[2:11:36] now let's let's notice here the tears
[2:11:38] heal
[2:11:39] that is farming
[2:11:42] matthew chapter 24 7-8
[2:11:44] the nation shall rise against nation the
[2:11:46] kingdom against kingdom and there shall
[2:11:49] be farming pestilence earthquake in
[2:11:51] devil's places all these things are the
[2:11:54] beginning
[2:11:55] of sorrows
[2:11:58] praise the lord
[2:12:00] see you are coming right up now and
[2:12:02] enlisting
[2:12:03] and now revelation in the sixth chapter
[2:12:05] now we are going to open the tears
[2:12:07] healed and is found in revelation six
[2:12:09] five and six
[2:12:10] and when he have opened the tail seal i
[2:12:14] beheld
[2:12:16] the tail beast said come and seed and i
[2:12:18] be hell and a blockhurst
[2:12:21] and he that sat on him
[2:12:24] had
[2:12:25] a pair of balance
[2:12:27] in his hands
[2:12:30] and i heard a voice in the
[2:12:32] midst
[2:12:34] of
[2:12:35] the full beast saying a measure
[2:12:39] for a penny
[2:12:42] a measure of wheat for a penny
[2:12:45] and a measure of bali
[2:12:47] for a penny
[2:12:50] and see that thou heard nat the ord and
[2:12:54] the wine
[2:12:56] so
[2:12:57] in the in in uh uh honor this honor the
[2:13:01] seal
[2:13:02] the the tear seal
[2:13:04] we see that uh
[2:13:06] uh it's a seal that that uh described
[2:13:10] you know
[2:13:11] a time of farming
[2:13:13] which of course
[2:13:14] jesus speaks about that also
[2:13:20] so in uh in in just a cup
[2:13:23] just a cap as you go through you realize
[2:13:26] that
[2:13:27] the the the first seal the the action in
[2:13:31] the first seal
[2:13:32] now you have to know that the seal
[2:13:35] itself is christ
[2:13:38] amen
[2:13:39] the happening the events in the seals is
[2:13:43] all of these horse rather
[2:13:45] and what are they doing
[2:13:48] the action of those horse rather in the
[2:13:51] seal
[2:13:52] is to prevent the people from getting to
[2:13:55] christ
[2:13:59] amen
[2:14:00] why are the deception for
[2:14:04] is to deceive the people
[2:14:06] keep them in the church
[2:14:09] and they are not getting to christ
[2:14:13] praise the lord
[2:14:15] what is the blood shear for
[2:14:18] amen amen
[2:14:21] so i was looking at i was looking at one
[2:14:24] of the the the the ukraine video and and
[2:14:28] this old mama and i mean she was crying
[2:14:30] and and she said it just broke my heart
[2:14:34] she said i've been praying to god she
[2:14:36] says what have i done what what have we
[2:14:38] done that god is not hearing our prayer
[2:14:42] so you see when when when those kind of
[2:14:45] things are happening
[2:14:47] when they are happening
[2:14:50] one it weakens your faith if you don't
[2:14:53] have a stable faith in god
[2:14:56] and you start to go through trials it
[2:14:58] looks like everything it looks like you
[2:15:00] know maybe god is not real why is this
[2:15:02] happening
[2:15:06] praise the lord
[2:15:09] why is this happening where is god and
[2:15:11] ukraine is all burning up
[2:15:15] glory be to god
[2:15:18] amen
[2:15:20] but you see men don't look for god when
[2:15:22] they are indulging in sin
[2:15:26] praise the lord
[2:15:27] they claim that is their will they claim
[2:15:29] that is their enjoyment it's my life i
[2:15:31] can do whatever i want to do with it
[2:15:33] they don't they don't ask for god when
[2:15:35] they are indulging in sin
[2:15:41] but when josh men's tracks and and and
[2:15:43] and sickness right then they say where
[2:15:45] is god oh god where are you he always
[2:15:47] been dead
[2:15:55] but you see god works with his law
[2:15:58] they are unwritten law that god placed
[2:16:01] in the universe
[2:16:04] whatever you saw that's what you would
[2:16:06] read it's a written law
[2:16:12] there's a lot of contracts
[2:16:16] you will not appreciate
[2:16:18] the light and the peace that you have
[2:16:22] until trouble comes around so the lord
[2:16:25] of contracts
[2:16:28] just a law that god put in the universe
[2:16:31] that's why i govern the universe
[2:16:36] when people start going through trouble
[2:16:39] then they appreciate oh my god they
[2:16:41] appreciate the good days
[2:16:44] it's a lot of contracts
[2:16:49] he allows us to experience sickness in
[2:16:51] our body for us to appreciate good
[2:16:53] health
[2:16:59] praise the lord
[2:17:04] are we together
[2:17:06] now so you see the uh uh
[2:17:09] the major event in the first seal
[2:17:12] was deception
[2:17:15] the major event in the first year i mean
[2:17:17] there there are things i can pick up
[2:17:19] here i mean uh we we can we can just
[2:17:22] spend the whole day i just you know just
[2:17:24] that's the reason why i signed that's on
[2:17:26] all laws and the power just now because
[2:17:28] i i've just prayed and i said lord send
[2:17:30] the power just quicken these people left
[2:17:32] forget about time
[2:17:36] send the power fill our stomach that
[2:17:38] will not be hungry
[2:17:47] oh praise the lord
[2:17:49] now then and and then the major event
[2:17:53] on the second seal was
[2:17:57] bloodshare
[2:18:01] now if you even look at it
[2:18:03] in sense of the church ages
[2:18:07] amen
[2:18:08] after nissan council
[2:18:13] when pagan rome began papa rome
[2:18:17] they decided to merge with the church
[2:18:21] they did not merge with the church
[2:18:23] because they believe in jesus
[2:18:27] no
[2:18:28] they merged with the church because that
[2:18:30] was their way to creep in
[2:18:33] and weaken
[2:18:34] the faith of the believers
[2:18:39] praise the lord
[2:18:41] constantine wanted a victory
[2:18:45] praise the lord
[2:18:46] he wanted a record
[2:18:49] of ruling and not having
[2:18:52] a divided kingdom
[2:18:56] because the believers in rome they were
[2:18:58] not associating with the roman law
[2:19:01] so the way that he would get these
[2:19:03] people
[2:19:05] is to identify with them
[2:19:11] so if he can if he can claim that he's a
[2:19:13] christian he's a believer he can accept
[2:19:16] that jesus
[2:19:17] pretty soon they believe now that they
[2:19:20] have a a christian president on the
[2:19:23] white throne
[2:19:28] oh a christian president in the white
[2:19:29] house let me say it that way
[2:19:32] you won't find one
[2:19:34] [Applause]
[2:19:36] you won't find one
[2:19:38] praise the lord
[2:19:40] and that's the reason why we have to
[2:19:43] pray for our nations and the authority
[2:19:47] because the one that's supposed to be
[2:19:49] ruling controlling the time is the
[2:19:51] believer not from the white house
[2:19:56] our prayers and our stand for the word
[2:19:59] controls the ties
[2:20:06] praise the lord so you see the whole
[2:20:08] thing there
[2:20:09] was the beginning of deception
[2:20:14] they deceived the christians they came
[2:20:16] in observed their laws
[2:20:19] they loved to say brother branham say
[2:20:21] okay i can say brother branham say
[2:20:26] praise the lord
[2:20:30] as long as they got in and and you know
[2:20:32] the prophet said when you pay your tax
[2:20:34] and your offering you are a member i
[2:20:36] will pay my time i will make it double
[2:20:39] so when i'm ready to vote my vote will
[2:20:42] have a stain
[2:20:45] i would double my my time so i can
[2:20:49] control
[2:20:52] that's that's how they started
[2:20:53] influencing
[2:20:55] the ministry to lay by you know we are
[2:20:59] there a lot of dignitaries coming to
[2:21:01] church now all of these things are
[2:21:03] people shouting clapping their hands
[2:21:04] then let's you know let's get some nice
[2:21:07] group put them in a red quiet gown they
[2:21:10] can sink
[2:21:12] [Applause]
[2:21:16] but that was deception
[2:21:24] that deception will give birth
[2:21:27] to the nicolaitan spirit
[2:21:34] praise the lord amen
[2:21:38] but you think about it there is jesus
[2:21:41] telling his disciple they're just
[2:21:43] talking to them
[2:21:45] take he let no man deceive you
[2:21:49] and see
[2:21:50] the content
[2:21:53] of those few words he said
[2:22:00] praise the lord
[2:22:03] now as he's talking to the disciples all
[2:22:05] in your mind they're just thinking about
[2:22:07] the pharisees
[2:22:09] no we're not going to listen to this guy
[2:22:10] they can't they can dis we believe your
[2:22:12] ministry
[2:22:14] but he's looking into the future age
[2:22:20] he's looking where deception will get on
[2:22:23] on the warehouse and and ride around the
[2:22:26] world
[2:22:30] and then after
[2:22:32] after that spirit of deception
[2:22:35] grew to a place of influence
[2:22:38] now they started slaughtering people
[2:22:41] to take the bibles from their hands
[2:22:44] we only have to listen to what the pope
[2:22:47] says
[2:22:49] then now it started becoming
[2:22:52] the second seal
[2:22:54] a rare horse rather started going
[2:23:04] praise the lord
[2:23:11] there is not a period of time on the
[2:23:13] surface of the earth
[2:23:15] that this book
[2:23:17] did not address
[2:23:21] praise the lord
[2:23:23] amen there is not a period of time
[2:23:26] on the surface of the earth the events
[2:23:29] that took place
[2:23:30] the year and the day that you were born
[2:23:32] is recorded by this book
[2:23:40] are we together
[2:23:44] so uh
[2:23:47] what what am i saying i'm getting out of
[2:23:48] time this morning
[2:23:50] uh brother brown preached the seven
[2:23:52] seals an entire week i can take one day
[2:23:54] to preach everything to you
[2:23:58] so uh but
[2:24:01] what i wanted to grab your mind too
[2:24:04] is for us to be able
[2:24:07] to appreciate
[2:24:12] for us to appreciate
[2:24:15] the ministry that has come to us in this
[2:24:18] last day
[2:24:20] praise the lord
[2:24:22] just like we said yesterday i mean last
[2:24:25] week
[2:24:26] we were talking about the blood that
[2:24:28] speak at better things
[2:24:30] and we started talking about the dna
[2:24:33] and how god plays in our dna
[2:24:38] error correcting system
[2:24:41] and if the almighty god
[2:24:44] where where did he took it from it has
[2:24:45] to come from him
[2:24:48] if god can place in our dna
[2:24:52] an error correcting system
[2:24:56] how much more
[2:24:58] the blood of jesus christ
[2:25:00] has the power
[2:25:03] amen
[2:25:06] it has the power to correct
[2:25:11] everything that is warring against us
[2:25:16] the word has the power
[2:25:19] to correct if we can just trust the word
[2:25:22] of god bring our habits and our desires
[2:25:26] to the word of god
[2:25:28] it has the power to correct
[2:25:31] and line us up
[2:25:36] praise the lord
[2:25:39] all the people can see and they can post
[2:25:41] everything they think they know that is
[2:25:43] wrong with the message but there is a
[2:25:46] correcting
[2:25:47] because it's the word that corrects the
[2:25:49] error
[2:25:51] there is a correcting power behind this
[2:25:53] word that will produce god a bride
[2:25:57] without spot or wrinkle
[2:26:00] praise the lord
[2:26:02] paul said he will present himself a
[2:26:04] bride with a spot or wrinkle unless god
[2:26:07] produced that there is no way we in
[2:26:10] ourself
[2:26:11] we can come out that way
[2:26:22] praise the lord
[2:26:29] so we see deception
[2:26:32] moving
[2:26:33] in the first seal the second is
[2:26:34] bloodshed
[2:26:36] the third is farming
[2:26:40] amen
[2:26:43] the world was taken away from the people
[2:26:46] spiritual farming
[2:26:48] the fourth seal
[2:26:51] is death
[2:26:56] the fifth seal is is is the source under
[2:26:58] the altar is uh
[2:27:01] the the jewish seal
[2:27:04] praise the lord
[2:27:07] the sixth seal is the tribulation seal
[2:27:11] and the seventh seal is the coming of
[2:27:13] the lord
[2:27:14] is the rapture seal
[2:27:19] the resurrection seal
[2:27:22] and all of them write it in the in the
[2:27:24] book in the book of matthew chapter 24.
[2:27:27] let me let me just take another one
[2:27:29] quickly and and then we
[2:27:31] we find a place here to close then i
[2:27:34] will slowly bring you back to uh my
[2:27:37] my subject this morning
[2:27:41] praise the lord
[2:27:43] now so you see that all of these things
[2:27:46] all of these things
[2:27:48] uh
[2:27:48] they are so
[2:27:51] they are so beautiful
[2:27:53] jesus when he went about
[2:27:55] year in
[2:27:57] in matthew
[2:27:59] he gets to verse 8 and he says and these
[2:28:02] things are the beginning of sorrow
[2:28:06] then he says then
[2:28:09] which means after all of these things
[2:28:12] have started happening
[2:28:13] something is going to happen
[2:28:17] then shall they deliver you
[2:28:21] to be afflicted and killed
[2:28:24] under the seal six million jews
[2:28:27] were killed
[2:28:31] honor this seal
[2:28:35] the the the the devil that was riding
[2:28:37] this you possess atlas hit off
[2:28:44] for no reason
[2:28:46] he hated the jews
[2:28:49] praise the lord
[2:28:52] so when jesus was saying this
[2:28:56] he was speaking about a spirit that
[2:28:58] would come upon hitler
[2:29:06] are we together
[2:29:10] he says after
[2:29:12] you have experienced all of this now so
[2:29:15] there is there is a change there that
[2:29:17] that's what i want to show you there is
[2:29:19] a change
[2:29:21] in the way that jesus is going to drive
[2:29:23] this home
[2:29:25] he says then
[2:29:26] they shall deceive you
[2:29:28] i mean deliver you to be afflicted and
[2:29:31] kill you
[2:29:32] and
[2:29:33] you shall be hated of all nations
[2:29:36] for my name's sake
[2:29:41] all nations
[2:29:43] at that time in that environment
[2:29:46] hather the jews
[2:29:56] praise the lord
[2:30:08] but if you read
[2:30:10] if you read the same account
[2:30:14] over in the book of luke let's get there
[2:30:16] while we why we our time is
[2:30:20] we are lost in our time in luke chapter
[2:30:22] 21
[2:30:23] let's let's try and get there
[2:30:33] if you read the same account in the book
[2:30:35] of luke
[2:30:44] praise the lord
[2:30:56] the luke account started with
[2:30:58] jesus talking about a widow
[2:31:01] putting her widow might
[2:31:03] into the offering where he says that she
[2:31:06] has done more than all of the men that
[2:31:08] were in the offering i mean there
[2:31:10] and uh
[2:31:12] in the synagogues
[2:31:14] praise the lord
[2:31:26] and then there from verse five
[2:31:28] the scripture says in some of the
[2:31:31] and and some
[2:31:32] speak
[2:31:33] of the temple how it was
[2:31:36] a door with uh goodly stones and gift
[2:31:40] and jesus started the same statement as
[2:31:42] for these things
[2:31:44] we should behold a day cometh
[2:31:46] where one stone would not be left upon
[2:31:48] another that shall not be thrown down
[2:31:51] and they ask him and say master
[2:31:54] but when shall these things be
[2:31:56] now another thing that
[2:31:58] is it will be important for us to
[2:32:00] appreciate
[2:32:02] is that
[2:32:04] all of these men that wrote their
[2:32:06] account
[2:32:07] of the
[2:32:08] scripture we have to realize that god
[2:32:13] had
[2:32:14] the gentile people in mind
[2:32:18] that even though
[2:32:20] luke was not one of the
[2:32:23] the the
[2:32:24] the 12 disciples
[2:32:28] but
[2:32:30] he wrote
[2:32:32] this record
[2:32:33] he wrote this report
[2:32:38] and uh and being a gentile
[2:32:42] his interest in
[2:32:45] what
[2:32:46] was what was told i see that he
[2:32:49] communicated to two fellows
[2:32:51] of what he have heard from the disciples
[2:32:57] is in a sense of relating
[2:32:59] because we we know that honor the old
[2:33:02] covenant the gentiles could never come
[2:33:05] close to the tabernacle
[2:33:08] or come close to the temple
[2:33:12] they could never come close to the
[2:33:13] temple
[2:33:15] but yeri said that
[2:33:19] the gentiles now are are now being
[2:33:22] exposed to
[2:33:25] to what is happening
[2:33:27] and and they are coming to understanding
[2:33:31] that god had them in in his mind
[2:33:35] so as luke writes his own report
[2:33:39] luke is always
[2:33:42] associating it he's he's keeping in mind
[2:33:46] what god was
[2:33:48] what jesus what god was doing to bring
[2:33:51] the gentile in
[2:33:53] praise the lord
[2:33:55] so you will see that uh
[2:33:57] uh luke luke is one of the one that
[2:33:59] expressed until the times of the gentile
[2:34:01] be fulfilled
[2:34:03] you know when i see as he makes his his
[2:34:05] record here but there is something i
[2:34:07] want to grab to your attention to as as
[2:34:10] you as we read this
[2:34:13] take here no man deceive you that verse
[2:34:15] a for many shall come in my name is
[2:34:17] saying i'm the christ
[2:34:20] and the time draw near
[2:34:22] go ye there and
[2:34:24] uh
[2:34:25] go in that therefore after them
[2:34:30] but when is a year of wars and
[2:34:33] commotions being now terrified
[2:34:38] for these things must first come to pass
[2:34:41] but the end is not
[2:34:43] by and by
[2:34:45] then say he unto them
[2:34:47] nations shall rise against nation
[2:34:49] you know great earthquake
[2:34:51] endeavor places farming pestilence
[2:34:54] fearful sights
[2:34:56] and great signs
[2:34:58] shall be there in the heaven
[2:35:01] but
[2:35:03] before
[2:35:04] all these
[2:35:08] that's a different language
[2:35:11] when matthew give his account
[2:35:15] he says and then
[2:35:19] when all of these things happen
[2:35:21] after he talks about the first seal the
[2:35:24] second seal the test seal the falsie
[2:35:26] wall farming he says and then
[2:35:29] they shall deliver you
[2:35:31] so much you go directly into
[2:35:35] what will be happening to the jews
[2:35:41] praise the lord
[2:35:43] but watch luke on a report
[2:35:46] look as he list these things he says but
[2:35:50] before all of this before we even get to
[2:35:53] this place
[2:36:00] praise the lord
[2:36:02] you know it's just like brother branham
[2:36:04] says in in the greater battle ever
[2:36:06] fought
[2:36:07] he says there are men that are built to
[2:36:10] read the heaven heaven the bodies
[2:36:12] he said you can go outside at night and
[2:36:14] look at the stars and say oh my goodness
[2:36:17] pretty
[2:36:18] ah one two three four five six seven 8
[2:36:21] and you try to count
[2:36:24] and then you know and you and you look
[2:36:26] at them
[2:36:28] but you'll realize also if you have a
[2:36:32] something like a telescope
[2:36:36] and
[2:36:36] and you look through that
[2:36:39] you realize the the the the optics of
[2:36:42] the telescope is made
[2:36:45] to be able to to bring that heavenly
[2:36:48] body much closer to you
[2:36:51] and then you will realize also that
[2:36:54] what you are looking at
[2:36:57] is more than what you are seeing
[2:37:02] praise the lord
[2:37:05] and there is another guy
[2:37:08] that is built to steady the heavenly
[2:37:10] bodies
[2:37:12] his telescope is not yours
[2:37:17] praise the lord
[2:37:19] because
[2:37:21] you are not somebody that started the
[2:37:23] heavenly bodies
[2:37:25] 500 is too expensive to pay on telescope
[2:37:32] praise the lord
[2:37:34] for me i will go to the tray store
[2:37:39] i want the 50 one
[2:37:41] i can't spend hundred dollars on that
[2:37:43] thing
[2:37:45] why because i'm only looking for
[2:37:47] amusement.
[2:37:50] praise the lord
[2:37:51] oh my oh my oh my
[2:37:55] but the man that is going to spend 500.
[2:38:01] one thousand five hundred dollars he
[2:38:03] said what
[2:38:04] that's why you spend on that
[2:38:07] there is a connection
[2:38:11] that makes him to spend that money
[2:38:15] he he artix has what they call
[2:38:20] resolving power
[2:38:24] when he looks to the heavens
[2:38:27] he's able to turn that thing and turn it
[2:38:30] and narrow it down
[2:38:34] his brain is not spread about
[2:38:37] he's seen a certain star in the heaven
[2:38:40] and he wants to narrow down and see what
[2:38:42] is that style
[2:38:45] because it's communicating to him
[2:38:49] for you is wow
[2:38:50] oh wow
[2:38:53] for him there's another language he's
[2:38:55] hearing
[2:38:58] praise the lord
[2:39:00] he can spend a thousand five hundred
[2:39:02] dollars well i mean how much it costs
[2:39:05] he's able to spend the money
[2:39:08] because he has an interest he's he's uh
[2:39:12] he's connected to the heavenly bodies
[2:39:15] he wants to get to them as close he
[2:39:18] wants to know them by name
[2:39:24] praise the lord
[2:39:31] you know it's just it's just like all
[2:39:32] the people that goes to the game some
[2:39:34] people just go to enjoy the game some
[2:39:36] people they want to they want to get
[2:39:37] close to their their best player and
[2:39:39] they want him to sign an autograph
[2:39:43] they keep sticking and pushing himself
[2:39:45] true
[2:39:48] praise the lord
[2:39:51] that guy has a language with the
[2:39:53] heavenly body he wants an identification
[2:39:58] so whatever it costs him
[2:40:01] he's willing to pay the price
[2:40:05] oh my goodness that's how it was for the
[2:40:09] christian in the dark ages that's how it
[2:40:11] is even for us in this age
[2:40:14] we are attached to this world and
[2:40:16] whatever it costs
[2:40:18] we are ready to pay the price
[2:40:23] praise the lord
[2:40:24] because for us it's not just church
[2:40:27] amen for us it's not what denomination
[2:40:30] you belong to
[2:40:32] praise the lord for us there is a
[2:40:34] rapture to go talk there is a millennia
[2:40:37] to come
[2:40:39] there is a new jerusalem
[2:40:41] praise the lord
[2:40:43] hallelujah and with all of those things
[2:40:46] in sight there is nothing in this world
[2:40:50] to be able to give up those things for
[2:40:54] we are ready to pay the price
[2:40:57] call us whatever name you want to call
[2:40:59] us we are ready to pay the price
[2:41:03] maybe your mind is just on a few meaning
[2:41:06] pleasure and why you can get out of this
[2:41:08] world but whatever it is it is
[2:41:10] perishable
[2:41:13] why are a form of enjoyment you think
[2:41:15] you can get from this present time is
[2:41:17] perishable
[2:41:23] so brother brahm talks about the those
[2:41:25] guys he says he says he says he says he
[2:41:28] says i'm not a sky i'm not a star uh
[2:41:31] gazer he said but there are men that are
[2:41:33] built for it
[2:41:36] he said just like those three wise men
[2:41:39] they were not brothers they were not
[2:41:41] triplets
[2:41:42] they were not neighbors either
[2:41:46] praise the lord
[2:41:47] there were three
[2:41:48] three young men
[2:41:51] from different parts
[2:41:53] that had the interest on the heaven the
[2:41:55] body and and from the different parts of
[2:41:57] wherever they came from they were all
[2:41:59] attracted to the same style
[2:42:04] when one looked at the star as he turned
[2:42:06] he turned he turned he's he looked at
[2:42:09] the star and what was speaking to him
[2:42:11] that is the star of a king
[2:42:16] praise the lord
[2:42:18] hallelujah
[2:42:19] as the other one steady the start he
[2:42:21] gave he see the start at the start of a
[2:42:24] seven
[2:42:26] he said that is the star of a seven
[2:42:30] it's a peculiar star it has a nature of
[2:42:33] a seven like no man
[2:42:36] like no other seven stars in the heaven
[2:42:42] praise the lord
[2:42:44] hallelujah
[2:42:47] and they stirred god as he was telling
[2:42:49] the style of strange my goodness
[2:42:52] man
[2:42:54] strange time
[2:42:56] amen i can see my understand the
[2:42:58] projector light is shining in my eyes
[2:43:05] first
[2:43:09] it's a strange strange stuff man
[2:43:13] as as he narrowed down and narrowed down
[2:43:18] all he could draw from that star or it
[2:43:20] was communicating to him
[2:43:26] was sacrifice
[2:43:30] all he was seeing is sacrifice man
[2:43:35] no he says no no no no no
[2:43:38] no
[2:43:39] let me let me
[2:43:41] no i think i yeah i think that i think
[2:43:44] the length of this thing is having
[2:43:45] problem
[2:43:47] because i have been studying i have been
[2:43:49] studying i see the constellation but as
[2:43:52] they are coming together
[2:43:55] what i'm drawing from it is sacrifice
[2:43:58] death like a death have never happened
[2:44:02] on the earth before a death of an
[2:44:04] innocent one
[2:44:08] and it's a better death
[2:44:10] all the messages were just mixed up
[2:44:14] i see zero in
[2:44:18] the lord
[2:44:19] oh my god
[2:44:21] the bible says the eyes of the lord run
[2:44:23] for and forth through the earth
[2:44:26] and that's the same where god built his
[2:44:28] prophets and he built his seven the
[2:44:30] house they are the ability to zero in on
[2:44:33] the word
[2:44:34] and tell you definite time and date
[2:44:37] of the fulfillment of the word
[2:44:41] praise the lord
[2:44:43] hallelujah
[2:44:46] so we close up now
[2:44:49] as we come back to
[2:44:53] the temple of the living god
[2:44:55] that god dwelled in
[2:44:58] a man that has raising up
[2:45:01] a synagogue of satan
[2:45:05] praise the lord
[2:45:10] paul says
[2:45:12] knowing that
[2:45:14] ye are a temple
[2:45:17] of the living god
[2:45:20] and that the spirit of god dwelleth in
[2:45:22] you
[2:45:25] that's the purpose of the cross
[2:45:28] praise the lord
[2:45:30] i believe that many of us that are
[2:45:32] sitting right in this building this
[2:45:34] morning
[2:45:36] if we were in nazareth
[2:45:38] and ever had in our mind
[2:45:41] that that young woman mary
[2:45:44] was caring
[2:45:46] our lord jesus

[2:50:43] thank you for being patient with me
[2:50:53] so
[2:50:55] [Music]
[2:51:05] [Music]
[2:51:20] our lord jesus said to his disciples
[2:51:23] [Music]
[2:51:25] just before he said those things he said
[2:51:27] let not your heart be troubled
[2:51:31] you believe in god believe also remain
[2:51:35] what a promise what a comfort
[2:51:38] he left with his people
[2:51:42] and showing us i'm going to prepare the
[2:51:44] place for you
[2:51:45] that where i am
[2:51:48] you'll be there also
[2:51:52] so you see
[2:51:55] the world can go in a way that is going
[2:52:02] all the cried of our hearts and the
[2:52:04] cries of the believers
[2:52:06] the crowd of the children of god like
[2:52:08] parents who cry oh god save my children
[2:52:12] children will cry oh god save my perish
[2:52:15] i have a friend i have a cursing
[2:52:21] because that's what the temple is for
[2:52:24] the temple is for sacrifice
[2:52:27] the temple is a place of worship
[2:52:30] it's not a place of discourse in the
[2:52:32] place of argument
[2:52:37] when the church has just become
[2:52:39] a place where a motivational speaker
[2:52:42] comes and just round the people up
[2:52:47] it has just become like a casino
[2:52:53] you wish to be
[2:52:54] lucky that you will be blessed
[2:52:58] you can put in this little seed and and
[2:53:01] and see put in some seed and you will
[2:53:03] get money that's what the church has
[2:53:05] become that's just a synagogue of satan
[2:53:07] to rip the people off
[2:53:12] but god is looking for temples
[2:53:16] bodies i will be able to bring worship
[2:53:19] or gratefulness to him lord i thank you
[2:53:26] i got a prayer request here of a young
[2:53:28] sister thanking god of turning another
[2:53:31] year
[2:53:33] this coming thursday
[2:53:36] i'm blessed
[2:53:40] to be living another year
[2:53:42] in jesus
[2:53:44] what a treasure
[2:53:47] that's what a temple is for
[2:53:53] where we can show gratefulness
[2:53:55] [Music]
[2:53:57] live a life of sacrifice
[2:54:00] to be a service
[2:54:04] unto our god and onto humanity
[2:54:08] that's the temple of the living god
[2:54:10] [Music]
[2:54:14] jesus came in and just before he left he
[2:54:17] got down on his knees and and washed the
[2:54:19] dust out of the disciples feet he said
[2:54:22] you call me lord and master i've done
[2:54:24] this to you do the same one unto another
[2:54:28] why because he was the temple
[2:54:31] the temple is a place of service it's a
[2:54:33] place of worship
[2:54:36] it's a place of sacrifice
[2:54:42] and that's what he want to make our life
[2:54:43] to be
[2:54:48] not the synagogues of satan
[2:54:51] that is just thinking about violence
[2:54:54] praise the lord
[2:54:56] thinking about death
[2:54:58] never the time that the thoughts of
[2:55:00] suicide has ravaged the minds of young
[2:55:03] people
[2:55:22] the movie industry fills their mind with
[2:55:24] all the violence
[2:55:26] put it in the form of games
[2:55:28] and they are playing video games filling
[2:55:30] their minds with demons
[2:55:33] that will soon start to haunt them
[2:55:35] for them to take their own lives
[2:55:51] let's just bring worship to the lord now
