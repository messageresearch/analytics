[1:04:44] Let's take our Bibles. And uh
[1:04:51] praise the Lord. We
[1:04:53] started speaking a couple of weeks ago
[1:04:55] on u Daniel chapter 9. Let's get back to
[1:05:00] Daniel chapter 9. And we will read from
[1:05:03] uh um
[1:05:06] the same verse we read from verse 20.
[1:05:09] Daniel chapter 9 verse 20.
[1:05:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:16] Daniel chapter 9 verse 20.
[1:05:22] Like we said before, Daniel
[1:05:27] was a Jewish boy, but God used him for
[1:05:30] gentile prophecy. So, the book of Daniel
[1:05:33] is uh is is a book that is filled with
[1:05:36] gentile prophecies and uh and some
[1:05:39] amazing things are in the book of
[1:05:41] Daniel.
[1:05:42] You find out what what Bible historians
[1:05:46] call the silent years between Malachi
[1:05:49] and Matthew. you find they are right in
[1:05:52] the book of Daniel. Amen. So there is
[1:05:54] nothing about the scripture that is
[1:05:56] silent. Amen.
[1:05:58] Praise the Lord. So Daniel chapter 9,
[1:06:00] let's read from verse uh 20.
[1:06:08] And while I was speaking and praying,
[1:06:12] I love this.
[1:06:14] while I was speaking and praying and
[1:06:17] confessing my sin and the sin of my
[1:06:20] people Israel
[1:06:22] and presenting my supplication
[1:06:26] before the Lord my God for the holy
[1:06:29] mountains of my God. Yeah, while I was
[1:06:32] speaking in prayer, even the man
[1:06:34] Gabriel, whom I have seen in a vision,
[1:06:38] this is the angel Gabriel coming to
[1:06:41] Daniel, but he came as a man. Praise the
[1:06:44] Lord.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now with flying wings on his back,
[1:06:47] he came as a man walking in the presence
[1:06:50] of Gabriel. Amen. whom I have seen in a
[1:06:54] vision at the beginning being caused to
[1:06:57] fly sweetly uh uh touching me about the
[1:07:03] time of the evening oblation
[1:07:07] and and he informed me and talked with
[1:07:10] me and said, "Oh Daniel, I am calm. I am
[1:07:15] now comfort to give thee skills and
[1:07:17] understanding." Praise the Lord.
[1:07:20] Something is bogging my mind, but I will
[1:07:22] get back to that. I've come to give you
[1:07:24] skills and understanding at the
[1:07:26] beginning
[1:07:28] of of that supplication,
[1:07:34] the commandments
[1:07:36] came forth, and I am come to show thee,
[1:07:40] for thou I greatly beloved. Therefore,
[1:07:43] understand the matter, and consider the
[1:07:45] vision. 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[1:07:49] people, and upon thy holy city, to
[1:07:52] finish the transgression, and to make an
[1:07:55] end of sin, and to make reconciliation
[1:07:58] for iniquity, and to bring in
[1:08:02] everlasting righteousness, and to seal
[1:08:05] up division, and prophecies, and to
[1:08:08] anoint the most holy. Know therefore and
[1:08:12] understand down here that from the going
[1:08:15] forth of the commandment to restore and
[1:08:18] to build Jerusalem from the glorif
[1:08:25] and to build Jerusalem unto

[1:12:48] a word of a truth prophet.
[1:12:51] Uh a word of a truth prophet. we want to
[1:12:54] read this uh uh and and I was reading
[1:12:58] this uh while studying and uh I thought
[1:13:01] I said well this this will come out to
[1:13:03] be to be a good one that we can we can
[1:13:06] all meditate appreciate this morning the
[1:13:10] way of the way of a truth prophet that's
[1:13:12] the way of a true prophet
[1:13:15] he had the word of the Lord for the
[1:13:19] nation
[1:13:22] but the word of the Lord was foreign to
[1:13:25] those people
[1:13:27] yet they thought they had it. Amen. Now
[1:13:31] you have to know here he's comparing
[1:13:33] Amos with the last day ministry. Uh uh
[1:13:37] so he's speaking about Amos. He had the
[1:13:39] word of the Lord but the word of the
[1:13:41] Lord was foreign to the people of that
[1:13:43] time in in every age. It has been the
[1:13:46] same you know. Uh but there are some
[1:13:48] things he say here that we can
[1:13:49] appreciate. He said yet they thought
[1:13:51] that he had it. I hope this get down
[1:13:55] deep. That's that's the reason why I
[1:13:57] read it. Amen. So, it's it's a kind of a
[1:14:00] statement to be able to get our
[1:14:02] attention. I hope you pay attention to
[1:14:04] this. I hope you pay attention to this.
[1:14:07] They thought they heard
[1:14:10] they thought
[1:14:12] that they were proud and religious
[1:14:16] that the word of the Lord was a foreign
[1:14:19] thing to them. And that is the way it is
[1:14:23] today. The true word of God may manifest
[1:14:27] is a foreign thing to lot of Pentecostal
[1:14:32] people.
[1:14:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of the Lord may manifest
[1:14:40] is foreign to lot of Pentecostal people.
[1:14:44] the real interpretation of the word. Not
[1:14:49] what we make the word to say.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Not what we think is saying, but what
[1:14:54] thou said the Lord says.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; The real interpretation of the word is
[1:15:00] foreign. Amen. You go out there there is
[1:15:05] lot of appealing statement and sometimes
[1:15:08] I listen to uh uh uh some of the short
[1:15:11] videos and short comment they they are
[1:15:13] they are appealing but I mean uh uh if
[1:15:17] if the voice of God has not grabbed your
[1:15:19] attention the voice of God for this age
[1:15:22] it have not grabbed your attention
[1:15:24] anything that sound good you will take
[1:15:25] it to be the word of the Lord.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything that say Jesus says or
[1:15:31] says the Bible says, you take it to be
[1:15:34] the word of the Lord. But the real the
[1:15:37] real the real interpretation of the
[1:15:40] word. Now listen now see see some of
[1:15:42] these things
[1:15:44] uh the real walls
[1:15:47] which mean the judgment.
[1:15:50] And this morning that's one of the thing
[1:15:51] we're going to talk about. We're going
[1:15:52] to speak about the three walls.
[1:15:55] Revelation 9 says, "The second world has
[1:15:58] ended. Behold, the tear war comes
[1:16:00] quickly."
[1:16:02] What are those things? What are the
[1:16:04] wars? We want to look at that this
[1:16:07] morning in uh uh uh I'm not teaching on
[1:16:10] it, but I'm going to pass that way.
[1:16:11] Amen.
[1:16:13] The real interpretation, the the real
[1:16:15] wars and and curses, the real blessings
[1:16:18] of God is a foreign thing to many people
[1:16:23] who call themselves holiness church
[1:16:25] member Christians. Why? Because the
[1:16:28] blessings of God are all attached to
[1:16:30] perishable things.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. People don't they they don't they
[1:16:35] don't they don't locate in the place of
[1:16:38] uh uh uh the real blessing of God is the
[1:16:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Is uh
[1:16:44] is is is an is an it's an evidence of
[1:16:47] adoption and uh the token to go in the
[1:16:49] rapture. I mean that's that's not where
[1:16:52] they are looking at you know uh uh
[1:16:54] that's not what they are they are
[1:16:55] pointing to. It's for it's a foreign
[1:16:57] thing to them. They don't know it
[1:17:00] mention it to them. Never heard of such
[1:17:04] a thing. I've never heard it
[1:17:08] that God will get a church without spot
[1:17:10] or wrinkle. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:15] That uh you were chosen in Christ before
[1:17:17] the foundation of the word. Praise the
[1:17:20] Lord. You were chosen before you became
[1:17:23] a sinner.
[1:17:28] It's a foreign thing
[1:17:31] because the language is we are all saved
[1:17:33] by grace. truth we are. But before
[1:17:37] before
[1:17:38] we became saved by grace, there was a
[1:17:40] work that was done before the foundation
[1:17:43] of the word. And there were names that
[1:17:45] were put on the book of life.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Your good work did not put your name on
[1:17:53] the book of life. You were not born and
[1:17:55] your name is not from the hospital
[1:17:57] registrate that your name was put on the
[1:17:59] book of life but from the mind of God
[1:18:02] when he first thought about you.
[1:18:05] Praise the Lord. Knowing that the the
[1:18:07] the million James that will come from
[1:18:09] out of your father the one that he
[1:18:12] predestinated that he look upon and said
[1:18:15] this will be the one that we live out in
[1:18:17] 2025.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:24] that he took a picture of you.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; A little boy one time was talking to his
[1:18:34] grandfather and he says, "Grandfather,
[1:18:36] do God really see me?" He says, "Yes,
[1:18:39] grandson, he loves you so much that he
[1:18:42] can't take his eyes off you."
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know when grandchildren
[1:18:49] are saying those things, something is on
[1:18:51] of their sleeves.
[1:18:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And that's a way to to be able to remind
[1:18:58] yourself that he loves you so much that
[1:19:00] he can take his eyes off you. Not only
[1:19:02] when you are in your good time, even
[1:19:04] when you are in your bad time, even when
[1:19:06] you are failing, he can take his eyes
[1:19:08] off you.
[1:19:11] Praise the Lord. And like brother
[1:19:13] Brandon says, you mention it. They have
[1:19:15] never heard of such a thing. And yet
[1:19:17] their organization grow and prosper
[1:19:19] getting bigger and bigger members all
[1:19:21] the time. more organization added every
[1:19:25] year they thought that
[1:19:28] anything that comes to them had to come
[1:19:30] out of the sectarian group. Praise the
[1:19:34] Lord. So the the reason why I read this
[1:19:37] is uh is is for us to say to you that we
[1:19:41] are a privileged people.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are a privileged people and we
[1:19:46] must count ourself to be blessed. Amen.
[1:19:48] Because what uh what what we share with
[1:19:51] you is not uh uh uh uh man calling
[1:19:56] devices. Amen. It's not something that
[1:19:58] we just we just think about that. Yeah,
[1:20:01] this thing will sound good. Let me go
[1:20:02] and say it.
[1:20:04] Praise the Lord. It has to be
[1:20:08] an echo.
[1:20:10] Amen. What we say to you is an echo. We
[1:20:13] are just echoing what the prophet of the
[1:20:15] age have said. Praise the Lord. So we
[1:20:18] must count ourself a privileged people.
[1:20:21] Many of us are uh uh young people you
[1:20:24] know either older people you know
[1:20:26] sometimes is it it does not get real to
[1:20:29] us. Sometimes we think that uh lot of
[1:20:31] the things that we put into this is our
[1:20:34] effort you know then the sacrifices that
[1:20:36] we made you know if God never got your
[1:20:39] attention you will never make the
[1:20:41] sacrifices that you are making.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God never got your attention to
[1:20:47] put his love in your heart for you to
[1:20:50] love him the way you love him, the
[1:20:52] measure that you love him, you will have
[1:20:54] never loved God the way you love him.
[1:20:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; So we know that it's not by power, it's
[1:21:01] not by might, it's by the grace of God.
[1:21:03] And we must always be grateful for grace
[1:21:06] that have found us. Amen. The God that
[1:21:08] has looked beyond our fault
[1:21:11] to be able to meet our needs.
[1:21:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; No doubt I believe there are some uh uh
[1:21:21] uh uh you know wonderful, beautiful
[1:21:23] people that uh that are hungering. I
[1:21:26] still believe there are people that are
[1:21:28] hungering and testing for truth. People
[1:21:30] that are hungering to be able to hear
[1:21:33] something from the word of God. not just
[1:21:35] uh you know a sandwich truth or just
[1:21:37] something you know uh uh of of popular
[1:21:40] demand you know something uh you know of
[1:21:43] of a balanced political speech. No, I
[1:21:46] mean something that will be able to tell
[1:21:48] them there is a living God. Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:53] So uh we must count ourself privileged
[1:21:56] people uh knowing that uh we have the
[1:21:59] real interpretation of the word of God
[1:22:02] to know what the plagues are what the
[1:22:04] seals you know I mean many many many uh
[1:22:08] uh uh people will not attempt to even
[1:22:10] read from the book of revelation to talk
[1:22:12] about the seals or talk about the church
[1:22:14] ages you know uh talk about the plagues
[1:22:18] you know so we must count ourself a
[1:22:20] privileged people. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And let make let's make use of
[1:22:25] everything that God has given to us.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So that's
[1:22:31] that just my introduction this morning.
[1:22:33] And while we get back to our subject of
[1:22:36] uh uh building in troubles time. We we
[1:22:38] we said that uh uh starting this
[1:22:41] subject, the book of Daniel exposed the
[1:22:43] gentile spiritual warfare. Amen. It
[1:22:47] speaks about the gentile spiritual
[1:22:49] warfare. You know, brother Bam says the
[1:22:50] gentile age begin uh uh uh with with
[1:22:54] supernatural things, supernatural signs,
[1:22:56] supernatural gift, you know, because the
[1:22:58] time of Daniel was uh was uh uh uh God
[1:23:02] giving the prophet Daniel uh uh uh
[1:23:05] supernatural uh dream dreams and vision
[1:23:08] just to be able to uh speak about our
[1:23:11] time. And like I said, uh one of God's
[1:23:14] attribute uh uh the Asian of day was
[1:23:17] manifested in Daniel. that that's is the
[1:23:19] only book that talks about the Asian of
[1:23:21] the Asian of Day was mentioned nowhere
[1:23:24] in the scripture but it was God
[1:23:26] manifesting himself uh uh to Daniel and
[1:23:29] Daniel saw one you know he talks about
[1:23:32] one like the son of man and one like the
[1:23:34] Asian of D which which looks like uh it
[1:23:38] looks like uh h a kind of a
[1:23:41] contradiction on until you understand
[1:23:44] that is God manifesting himself. Praise
[1:23:48] the Lord. As the supreme authority.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; That's what the Asian of Days stands
[1:23:54] for. The supreme authority. One that is
[1:23:57] the supreme judge.
[1:24:00] Amen. Daniel say, "I seen one like the
[1:24:02] son of man coming to the Asian of D."
[1:24:07] So there's a ministry of a son of man
[1:24:09] that will bring us to that place where
[1:24:12] we will come under the supreme
[1:24:15] authority.
[1:24:17] Praise the Lord. And that was only seen
[1:24:20] in Daniel. Then we also talk about where
[1:24:23] Daniel talk about the prince of Pesure.
[1:24:25] He says, "And the prince of Greece comes
[1:24:28] also." Praise the Lord. And he's using
[1:24:30] these words
[1:24:33] uh that uh uh uh sounds like like ranks
[1:24:39] in the empire of Pes or ranks like in
[1:24:42] the empire of the Greeks. But these were
[1:24:46] these were spiritual ranking demons.
[1:24:51] Amen. It was not just like the prince
[1:24:54] you talk about the the prince in Dubai
[1:24:56] or you know there the uh uh no that's is
[1:25:00] it was not that kind of a prince that
[1:25:02] Daniel was talking about. He was talking
[1:25:04] about a a supreme power. He was talking
[1:25:08] about uh uh a chief demon power that was
[1:25:12] over the land of Persia.
[1:25:17] He was governing the affairs of the evil
[1:25:19] that were done in Persia that uh that
[1:25:22] that that that Gabriel couldn't break in
[1:25:24] and bring uh answers to Daniel.
[1:25:28] And Daniel speaks of all of these
[1:25:29] things, but he also speaks of the the
[1:25:32] prince of of of Greece, you know, uh uh
[1:25:35] that's that is uh so uh it is from there
[1:25:38] that we know we learn that every
[1:25:40] kingdom, every nation has a chief demon
[1:25:45] power. Amen.
[1:25:47] Paul says, "We rattle not against flesh
[1:25:49] and blood but against principalities,
[1:25:53] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[1:25:56] And these are all praying spirits. You
[1:25:59] know Daniel talked about that. But as he
[1:26:01] talks about the spirits that are
[1:26:03] governing the earth, he also talks about
[1:26:06] the spirit that is that is that is in
[1:26:08] charge of the believer.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Just like the nation have praise, we
[1:26:14] also have praise. He says Messiah the
[1:26:16] prince. Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Will stand for his people.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; So we have one that is standing for us.
[1:26:28] Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or else we will have all
[1:26:32] been wept out. We have all been, you
[1:26:34] know, uh we will not be here to be
[1:26:36] celebrating our victory. Amen. But we
[1:26:39] have Miah the prince. So Daniel is
[1:26:42] dealing with uh with some with some with
[1:26:44] some tough stuff. Amen. He's dealing
[1:26:47] with some real things.
[1:26:49] And uh so as as we talk about this, you
[1:26:52] will see why these are important because
[1:26:54] Daniel talk about the the gentile
[1:26:57] superpower. Amen. Today you know people
[1:27:01] look at Russia, America that is that is
[1:27:03] just uh uh uh uh political political
[1:27:07] powers that are ruling the world but
[1:27:09] they are not superpower. I calling to
[1:27:11] the Bible that uh the the the gentile
[1:27:14] word has uh uh uh five superpower you
[1:27:18] know the Babylonian kingdom the the me
[1:27:21] and Persian you know the Greeks and and
[1:27:23] and then coming down to the Roman that
[1:27:26] that was in the lead and it broke both
[1:27:28] into papa Rome and pagan Rome.
[1:27:31] So these are the the kingdoms that have
[1:27:34] been ruling the gentile empire. I call
[1:27:37] into God and I call into prophecy.
[1:27:42] So right now we we uh we we are we are
[1:27:45] stay on the uh uh the Roman domain.
[1:27:49] Amen.
[1:27:50] So you we find all of that over in uh in
[1:27:53] the book of Daniel. So it's a it's a
[1:27:56] very it's a very rich book. Amen. It's a
[1:28:00] very very rich book. So uh as we look at
[1:28:03] this uh the subject that we want to look
[1:28:05] at this morning, this is where my
[1:28:07] thoughts are going. You know, this is
[1:28:10] where my thoughts are going. Uh the
[1:28:12] moment I can give you, you know, uh uh
[1:28:16] uh my thoughts, then we all, you know,
[1:28:18] we can we can fight and eat on it. Amen.
[1:28:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:24] Hallelujah.
[1:28:26] If you if you never grown up where food
[1:28:28] was set before you and many others that
[1:28:31] you have to not eat eat uh uh nicely,
[1:28:35] you got to try to eat a little more.
[1:28:38] Amen. You got to try to outsmart
[1:28:40] somebody to eat meat. If you have never
[1:28:43] done that before, welcome. Praise the
[1:28:46] Lord.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] Praise the Lord. So uh where I'm going
[1:28:52] this morning is I want you I want us to
[1:28:54] watch this now. Uh as we started this
[1:28:57] subject we were talking about how God
[1:29:00] how God design it in a way to be able to
[1:29:04] build
[1:29:06] uh uh even even before he will come down
[1:29:09] and and uh and give us a universe
[1:29:13] you know he decided to do that in wars.
[1:29:17] Amen. He decided to do it. There there
[1:29:20] is just there is just something
[1:29:22] mysterious about God word. He used
[1:29:26] difficult times
[1:29:28] to be able to build his people. The
[1:29:31] Bible says he will he will he will uh uh
[1:29:35] uh he will give he will give the woman
[1:29:38] three sacred virtues there that will be
[1:29:42] given to her for redemption. But he did
[1:29:44] it in the night. He shut the whole uh uh
[1:29:47] creation down, you know. Uh he shut the
[1:29:50] whole creation down. It was night uh uh
[1:29:53] uh black and dark and then he went right
[1:29:56] into that darkness and formed the woman
[1:29:59] and gave her this secret virtue. You
[1:30:01] know, he showed that uh in Genesis
[1:30:03] chapter 15 to Abraham, you know, he shut
[1:30:06] the heavens when he was making covenant
[1:30:08] with Abraham and and promising Abraham.
[1:30:11] He brought darkness on the earth. that
[1:30:13] it's just something that is just
[1:30:15] mysterious of our God that uh that's the
[1:30:19] reason why Paul could say uh you know
[1:30:21] the foolishness of God is wiser than
[1:30:23] men. Amen. Praise the Lord. The
[1:30:26] foolishness of God is wiser than men. I
[1:30:28] mean uh uh uh I mean that God will want
[1:30:31] to save his people, you know, from a
[1:30:33] judgment and then tell Noah to build a
[1:30:35] boat.
[1:30:37] Praise the Lord. this almighty God. Why
[1:30:40] why not just uh you know create a
[1:30:43] supernatural presence around them you
[1:30:45] know uh uh uh and let everybody see them
[1:30:48] floating in the air.
[1:30:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:53] You got to put this old man to work for
[1:30:55] 120 years and uh you don't even have
[1:30:58] building skills.
[1:31:00] He was a farmer.
[1:31:02] But that's the way God works.
[1:31:05] You see, because uh uh uh uh a whole lot
[1:31:09] of your life is hid in a mystery.
[1:31:13] What you think you know about yourself
[1:31:15] is a little bit of the picture.
[1:31:21] We are put down here
[1:31:23] and all of our life is to discover who
[1:31:26] we are
[1:31:32] because you are more of a spirit being
[1:31:37] than the physical self you are seeing.
[1:31:41] Don't look at your your face. Don't look
[1:31:43] at your body. Don't look at your age.
[1:31:48] You have an ageless being in you.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; You have a You have a being in you that
[1:31:58] uh that that was there before the word
[1:32:01] began.
[1:32:03] And that's what life on earth is all
[1:32:05] about. That's what the the the gospel
[1:32:09] message is all about. That's what grace
[1:32:11] has come to you and myself so we can
[1:32:13] discover who is this person.
[1:32:16] Praise the Lord. All the troubles of
[1:32:19] life that we have gone through, it's not
[1:32:21] because the family we came from, the
[1:32:23] country we were born or or something
[1:32:25] about this body. No, it's about that
[1:32:28] that treasure that is in you, that
[1:32:30] mystery that is in your body.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That God want you to discover.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And you die a
[1:32:38] disappointed person if you really don't
[1:32:40] know who you were. All your days on
[1:32:43] earth, you are just impersonating,
[1:32:46] trying to be like somebody you saw on
[1:32:48] the magazine, somebody you saw in the
[1:32:50] news, somebody you saw in the paper. We
[1:32:52] always trying to be like somebody when
[1:32:54] we need to really know who we are, where
[1:32:57] we came from, where we going, what is
[1:32:59] this all about?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:14] And then so so when you see it here, you
[1:33:16] realize that uh uh
[1:33:21] man, I don't even know where to start
[1:33:22] from, but let's go ahead anyway. You
[1:33:25] look at it here, you realize that uh uh
[1:33:28] uh
[1:33:30] think about it. Think about it. Look,
[1:33:32] look at this. Look at this. Revelation
[1:33:33] chapter 12. Let's start from somewhere.
[1:33:35] Revelation chapter 12. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:38] If you don't help me this morning, you
[1:33:40] know that you're on a very long route.
[1:33:42] Amen.
[1:33:44] Because actually, I really preach for 30
[1:33:48] minutes. But I need to find myself.
[1:33:51] Amen. I need to gather my thoughts cuz
[1:33:54] it's all scattered all over the place.
[1:33:57] And as soon I do that, then 30 minutes I
[1:33:59] bring my message. So all these things
[1:34:01] I'm doing, I'm just trying to gather my
[1:34:03] thoughts. Amen. So just be patient with
[1:34:05] me. I'm I'm I'm a Paul speaker.
[1:34:08] Revelation 12. Let's look at this. Verse
[1:34:10] 7. The Bible says, "And there was war in
[1:34:13] heaven. Michael and his angels fought
[1:34:16] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[1:34:19] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[1:34:22] was their place for anymore in heaven."
[1:34:25] Now, so you realize that every
[1:34:29] word every word that we we ever
[1:34:32] experience
[1:34:34] started in heaven.
[1:34:37] Amen. So just like just like I was
[1:34:40] saying from from what Daniel is showing
[1:34:43] about the prince of Persia and he's
[1:34:44] talking about Messiah the prince and and
[1:34:47] and and he's saying that the prince of
[1:34:48] Persia stopped me but Micah the
[1:34:51] archangel came. So we realize that wars
[1:34:54] wars all these forces they are not your
[1:34:58] battle.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Wars are not your battle.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; We just become battleground.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Where spirits come and war
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; on us.
[1:35:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:19] Wars are not your battle.
[1:35:23] Every war uh uh uh uh begin uh uh uh you
[1:35:27] know uh they were all angelic wars. uh
[1:35:30] uh Isaiah uh 14 tell us there Lucifer
[1:35:33] saying I will ascend my throne and God
[1:35:35] saying I will bring you down to the
[1:35:37] lowest you know and and and that
[1:35:39] spiritual war that started in heavenly
[1:35:42] places you know uh now becomes human
[1:35:46] conflict
[1:35:48] it becomes parent and children fussing
[1:35:50] husband and wifeing
[1:35:55] praise the Lord when it's it's it's it's
[1:35:58] just the effect of what is taking place.
[1:36:03] That is the reason why if if there is a
[1:36:05] situation if we can just grab oursel and
[1:36:08] ask our what this is all about.
[1:36:12] What this is all about
[1:36:15] because sometimes it's it's just some of
[1:36:17] the most silliest thing that if you just
[1:36:20] take time to think about it, you realize
[1:36:23] you don't have no reason to fuss.
[1:36:32] Are we together? So wars, you see wars
[1:36:35] are uh uh
[1:36:40] praise the lord
[1:36:44] what what were angelic wars have become
[1:36:46] human conflict. They have become human
[1:36:50] conflict and and and and the influence
[1:36:53] that war that uh uh that is that uh John
[1:36:57] is telling us about you're describing
[1:36:59] war in heaven became human conflict you
[1:37:02] know and before it was start in the
[1:37:05] human conflict it started the first
[1:37:08] world war was a lie
[1:37:14] if you just look at some of the things
[1:37:15] that is creating some of the the the the
[1:37:18] the family dispute that families have
[1:37:22] church problems.
[1:37:25] Praise the Lord. When none of us can
[1:37:27] save ourself, yes, we have church
[1:37:30] problem. We have reason why we can't go
[1:37:33] to this church.
[1:37:35] When none of nobody went to Calvary.
[1:37:40] So when you look at some of the things
[1:37:43] you realize that is just an influence
[1:37:46] from somewhere.
[1:37:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:50] I think I think some of you I think you
[1:37:52] have seen that you know where where
[1:37:54] where you know uh uh uh someone is just
[1:37:57] is just telling of what has happened you
[1:37:59] know and and they I mean they they are
[1:38:02] dramatizing and I can't believe it and
[1:38:04] and and right away
[1:38:08] another innocent guy just get angry and
[1:38:11] he ready to fight.
[1:38:14] You really they did that to you?
[1:38:19] Where was that? Who's that?
[1:38:22] He don't know what has happened. He
[1:38:24] don't know who is this person. But just
[1:38:27] from the way the person is uh you know
[1:38:30] using all their energy to say this, this
[1:38:33] guy is anointed.
[1:38:36] He want to fight.
[1:38:39] And sometimes that's the way we are.
[1:38:42] Amen. That's the way we are.
[1:38:50] So what were where what what were
[1:38:52] angelic wars be uh has become human
[1:38:55] conflict and and and and they have
[1:38:58] influenced some of the dispute. What
[1:39:01] were angelic war became the first lie in
[1:39:03] Eden.
[1:39:06] Praise the Lord. It became the first lie
[1:39:10] in Eden.
[1:39:12] And then from the first wall, that's uh
[1:39:16] uh uh uh uh uh Revelation chapter 9, it
[1:39:19] says, "Behold the first war and after
[1:39:21] the first war come the second wall,
[1:39:24] which is the second wall war." We will
[1:39:25] get to there, but I just I just trying
[1:39:27] to build up here. So from the first
[1:39:29] first war or the first lie then it it it
[1:39:32] what did it became? Uh it became the
[1:39:34] first idolatry. So it was it was a lie
[1:39:37] that was told to one person and then the
[1:39:40] next thing two person got involved
[1:39:43] that wall in heaven now has affected
[1:39:46] then the next thing that is that a whole
[1:39:48] family is involved because king has
[1:39:50] killed a
[1:39:52] first lie the first adultery the first
[1:39:54] murder
[1:39:57] those were the first three wars
[1:40:02] happening right in Eden
[1:40:09] But they were influenced
[1:40:13] from the war in heaven.
[1:40:15] Praise the Lord. Word John testified
[1:40:19] here that uh uh uh uh Micah and his
[1:40:22] angel fought against the dragon and his
[1:40:24] the dragon and his angels uh uh the
[1:40:27] dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:40:30] angels and prevailed net. Praise the
[1:40:32] Lord. Hallelujah. Verse nine. And that
[1:40:36] great dragon was cast out, that old
[1:40:38] serpent
[1:40:40] called the devil and Satan which
[1:40:43] deceiveth the whole world. He was cast
[1:40:46] into the earth. So you see what was
[1:40:49] angelic world
[1:40:51] now has become human conflict.
[1:40:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:58] It started to deal with one person
[1:41:01] break into the realm of reasoning.
[1:41:05] Amen.
[1:41:06] Which is our mind battles.
[1:41:09] Amen. Our mind battles. Sometimes our
[1:41:13] war is with ourself.
[1:41:18] Are we together? We are just in the word
[1:41:20] of our own mind.
[1:41:24] Glory be to God.
[1:41:29] You love the Lord.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see and and and that's what
[1:41:34] happened. You know uh uh uh if a person
[1:41:38] don't take God's word, if you are not
[1:41:40] reading God's word and believing what
[1:41:42] God says, you will make your mind your
[1:41:44] own God
[1:41:48] because you will think
[1:41:52] your thoughts are right.
[1:41:56] The way you think about it is right.
[1:41:57] Everybody in the world is wrong.
[1:42:02] Praise the Lord. Your mind becomes your
[1:42:04] own absolute.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:42:13] now? So you see uh uh uh what was
[1:42:16] angelic war became human conflict and
[1:42:18] now influencing all our dispute here on
[1:42:21] the earth. It it you know influenced the
[1:42:23] first lie, the first adultery, the first
[1:42:25] bloodshare. Lie was a one person,
[1:42:28] adultery was two person. The bloodshare
[1:42:30] divided the whole family. So we see here
[1:42:33] that the first world was a religious
[1:42:36] war. Amen. It was a religious war. The
[1:42:39] first blood that was ever shared was
[1:42:40] shared on the altar.
[1:42:43] Praise the Lord. So you see church, this
[1:42:47] thing uh uh about serving God, this
[1:42:50] thing about uh uh uh uh you know uh if
[1:42:54] we if we don't come into his presence,
[1:42:57] if we don't come into his sanctuary, we
[1:43:00] we it's it's easy for us to take on a
[1:43:03] religious spirit and rel and and and a
[1:43:05] religious spirit can get bloody.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] Yeah. Religious spirit can get bloody
[1:43:16] because until we come into his presence
[1:43:19] and become h and take on his attribute
[1:43:22] and become his uh h take on his nature.
[1:43:27] That's the only way we can be
[1:43:28] sacrificed.
[1:43:30] Amen.
[1:43:32] And that's the only way we can give
[1:43:34] ourself for others. That's the only way
[1:43:36] we can let go and let others have the
[1:43:38] room.
[1:43:40] But until we come to that place, we're
[1:43:42] going to fight our ground. And if it has
[1:43:45] to be bloody, let it be bloody.
[1:43:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:56] Religion is one of the greatest curse
[1:43:58] the world ever have because it never
[1:44:00] brings conviction.
[1:44:02] And when a man is not converted, he's
[1:44:05] very dangerous.
[1:44:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:11] He can kill for what he believe that
[1:44:14] he's not ready to live.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can kill for what he believe,
[1:44:22] but he's not ready to live.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; That's how dangerous it can be.
[1:44:29] Let's get into this thing, people. We
[1:44:32] are building in troubleous times. So we
[1:44:34] see here that uh uh uh uh there there
[1:44:39] there is just something there is
[1:44:40] something mysterious about how God you
[1:44:44] know works in this way that uh uh just
[1:44:49] in the midst of the chaos he was able to
[1:44:51] bring out a garden of Eden. Praise the
[1:44:54] Lord. in the midst of Adam and Eve
[1:44:56] falling to lies and uh uh uh you know uh
[1:45:01] uh getting into the devil deceit and
[1:45:03] adultery and all of that but yet he was
[1:45:05] able to provide a lamb.
[1:45:09] So you see that uh uh God always build
[1:45:13] in the midst of our rubbish. He always
[1:45:16] build when when there when we are in
[1:45:19] troubles time when it looks like
[1:45:21] everything the Bible say the imagination
[1:45:23] of men were evil and and and they were
[1:45:25] taking as wives as many as the one you
[1:45:28] know and and the the whole earth was but
[1:45:30] yet he was able to build an ark
[1:45:34] just when the world is just going crazy
[1:45:37] but yet God has a design he's building
[1:45:40] something
[1:45:44] praise the Lord
[1:45:47] Amen. He's building something. Let me
[1:45:50] let me show you where what caught my
[1:45:52] mind on this thing. Revelation. Let's go
[1:45:55] to the book of Revelation.
[1:45:57] We just take few verses quickly.
[1:46:00] Revelation chapter 8.
[1:46:03] Amen. Revelation chapter 8
[1:46:11] verse 13. And I beheld and I and and and
[1:46:14] I heard an angel flying through the
[1:46:16] midst of heaven
[1:46:18] saying with a loud voice, w
[1:46:22] to the inhabitants of the earth by
[1:46:25] reasons of the other h voices of the
[1:46:29] trumpet of the three angel which are yet
[1:46:34] to sound. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are
[1:46:36] that? What is that?
[1:46:39] Praise the Lord. What is that?
[1:46:42] Revelation chapter 19. No, chapter 9.
[1:46:45] Sorry. Revelation chapter 9.
[1:46:48] Let's look at verse
[1:46:51] Let's look at verse 12. Like I said, I
[1:46:54] just I just want to to pick these
[1:46:56] verses. And you can can go and read and
[1:47:01] study on your own here. Uh verse 12,
[1:47:05] listen to what it says here. One world
[1:47:08] is passed. Verse 8 tells us about a
[1:47:11] flying angel that have that have
[1:47:13] pronounced to the inhabitants of the
[1:47:16] earth world.
[1:47:21] In verse nine here we see the Bible
[1:47:24] speaks of
[1:47:28] one world is passed. Verse 12 in chapter
[1:47:31] 9. One war is passed and behold there
[1:47:35] come two wars more hereafter.
[1:47:38] Praise the Lord. A prophet will come and
[1:47:41] help us to see that these walls that are
[1:47:45] pronounced to the earth
[1:47:48] they are the war wall wars.
[1:47:52] Amen. Because these war walls are major
[1:47:56] curse.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:02] They are major curse that is that is
[1:48:04] going to affect the inhabitants of the
[1:48:07] earth.
[1:48:09] So every nation on the heaven one way or
[1:48:13] the other will be affected by these by
[1:48:16] these wars. So chapter nine says one
[1:48:20] pass and they are two to come because
[1:48:22] the angel in chapter 8 said world wars.
[1:48:29] Are we together?
[1:48:31] Follow me a little bit here. Just be
[1:48:34] patient.
[1:48:35] Amen. Chapter 11. Chapter 9 say, "One
[1:48:40] war is passed and behold there there
[1:48:42] cometh two walls more yet after."
[1:48:44] Chapter 11 verse 14, the Bible says,
[1:48:48] "The second war is passed and behold the
[1:48:51] tear wall come quickly."
[1:48:55] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:49:01] The second world is passed and behold
[1:49:04] the tail world comes quickly. And now
[1:49:07] when when when you look at these
[1:49:09] prophecies that are in the Bible and
[1:49:11] then you try to bring it to history, you
[1:49:15] realize this this is the thing that
[1:49:16] caught my attention people. If you
[1:49:19] realize all of these three wars which
[1:49:22] represent the three wars
[1:49:26] happen in our generation
[1:49:31] when it has to do with biblical
[1:49:33] dispensation.
[1:49:35] Now this is the thing that grasp that
[1:49:37] grab my attention. Pay attention to
[1:49:39] this.
[1:49:40] Here is it that God said in Malachi 4,
[1:49:45] behold I come and smash the earth with a
[1:49:48] curse.
[1:49:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:52] He said, "Behold, I come and smash the
[1:49:55] earth." Re I mean, uh, Malachi 4:1 talks
[1:49:58] about where the whole earth is going to
[1:50:01] burn and the and and the righteous will
[1:50:03] come and walk on the ashes of the
[1:50:04] wicked. But God says, "I will hold to
[1:50:07] that until I send a prophet messenger on
[1:50:11] the earth until I send Malachi for.
[1:50:14] Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet."
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And he will come and turn the hearts of
[1:50:22] the children back to the father, the
[1:50:24] fathers to the children, the children to
[1:50:26] the fathers. And then I will come and I
[1:50:29] will smash the earth with a curse.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:36] See the progression. See the fulfillment
[1:50:38] of this.
[1:50:41] Are we together?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:46] Oh my my my.
[1:50:49] Amen.
[1:50:53] Watch this as we as we study together.
[1:50:58] The first war war was in 1914.
[1:51:04] Okay. It was in 1914 when the first
[1:51:08] world war was started.
[1:51:13] But Brandon was born 1909.
[1:51:17] Count from 1909 to 1914.
[1:51:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:23] The first world war was started
[1:51:26] November uh uh uh no started July 28,
[1:51:30] 1914. Here
[1:51:36] is God promising to send a ministry,
[1:51:42] a ministry, a humble ministry that will
[1:51:46] that will be able to labor among the
[1:51:48] people
[1:51:50] and to be able to get his predestinated
[1:51:53] children grab their attention.
[1:51:56] And just when uh that
[1:52:02] little child where the the parents were
[1:52:04] not even religious. The father was a
[1:52:06] drunk.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:11] And God just slip in there. Praise the
[1:52:14] Lord.
[1:52:16] He just slip in there. Not finding a
[1:52:18] religious family. It just found this
[1:52:21] ordinary family. He just slip right in
[1:52:23] there. And a gift was born into the
[1:52:25] earth.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:30] Hallelujah.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; But right at that time,
[1:52:39] they want to saw the supernatural things
[1:52:41] that took place at at his birth and all
[1:52:43] of that. We know the story about it. But
[1:52:45] what will happen is that
[1:52:49] in 1914
[1:52:53] when this uh a little child will have
[1:52:56] his first vision as a seven-year-old
[1:52:59] boy,
[1:53:01] you remember going to fresh water with
[1:53:03] his brothers and the whalewind go right
[1:53:06] in the bush and he hear grab his
[1:53:09] attention. innocent child walking with a
[1:53:12] bare feet
[1:53:14] in the hills of Kentucky. And he will y,
[1:53:18] "Do not
[1:53:20] drink,
[1:53:22] do not smoke, do not defile your body
[1:53:28] because I have a work for you."
[1:53:32] At the time he's hearing that voice, the
[1:53:35] entire world is breaking into a war.
[1:53:49] He's confused.
[1:53:52] Throw the bucket down. Rent to his
[1:53:54] mother and say that the bird talked to
[1:53:56] me. Mama, the bird talked to me.
[1:54:00] Billy, are you okay?
[1:54:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:16] If we would learn to step back a little
[1:54:18] bit, people
[1:54:22] and just pay attention and ask ourself
[1:54:26] what this is all about.
[1:54:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:32] will realize that uh there is more
[1:54:37] to this life that we have not understand
[1:54:39] yet.
[1:54:42] Just at that time
[1:54:44] 11 years I mean 7 years old the the the
[1:54:48] uh uh uh that that was the beginning of
[1:54:51] the first world war. He said I was just
[1:54:53] a child. I couldn't go. You see, I've
[1:54:56] always wanted to be in a war and didn't
[1:54:59] know that God has prepared him for the
[1:55:01] greatest battle ever fought.
[1:55:04] Amen.
[1:55:06] Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] Did he know that God has prepared him to
[1:55:09] be a commander for this greater battle
[1:55:11] that we are in to prepare the people to
[1:55:14] be able to fight spiritual war?
[1:55:22] But it's the beginning of your message.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Is the beginning is the birth of your
[1:55:28] messenger
[1:55:30] born in a time of war.
[1:55:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:37] The fulfillment of Revelation chapter
[1:55:39] nine. The first war cometh and after
[1:55:43] that two other wars will come and that
[1:55:47] war lasted for four years.
[1:55:52] The entire world was in war.
[1:55:56] Praise the Lord. Every nation was
[1:55:59] involved one way or the other.
[1:56:04] Praise the Lord. If they did not have
[1:56:06] men that were fighting their nation, her
[1:56:09] alliance with countries that were
[1:56:11] involved in the war.
[1:56:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:27] But just at that time, that's where
[1:56:33] Malachi fall was just a little boy
[1:56:36] in the hills of Kentucky.
[1:56:39] Are we together?
[1:56:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:52] One year after the war started, that was
[1:56:54] in 1915,
[1:56:57] he had that he had that experience.
[1:57:04] The first world ended and behold the
[1:57:07] second war cometh. And that was in uh uh
[1:57:11] uh September of 1939.
[1:57:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:28] 1933,
[1:57:33] it was the visitation on the Ohio River.
[1:57:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:40] A young Baptist preacher
[1:57:42] was preaching. Praise the Lord. have not
[1:57:46] met his uh commission yet. Didn't know
[1:57:49] that there was a message of the hour.
[1:57:51] Praise the Lord. All of those things
[1:57:53] came later. He was a young Baptist
[1:57:55] preacher preaching.
[1:57:59] At that time he was baptized in his 17th
[1:58:02] person
[1:58:04] that seem injured. I met him when he was
[1:58:06] just a sevenyear-old boy came on the
[1:58:09] Ohio River and said just as John the
[1:58:12] Baptist was saying.
[1:58:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; That was 1933.
[1:58:20] In 1939,
[1:58:22] the second war started.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Once again, the whole
[1:58:32] entire world was in war.
[1:58:38] But you see
[1:58:41] as the word
[1:58:43] was going on in the AAS and everything
[1:58:46] that was happening and you know then and
[1:58:48] and and and out of Hitler is on the
[1:58:50] other side you know and and and he's uh
[1:58:53] h getting after the Jewish people and
[1:58:56] nations around the world are are
[1:58:58] gathering together to be able to stop
[1:59:00] that mustard and and and what was
[1:59:02] happening at the time. But here we say
[1:59:04] God was doing something simple
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; in simplicity. Almighty God has come on
[1:59:12] the earth just like when John was at the
[1:59:16] river Jordan. Once again
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; there was no big crowd. There was no
[1:59:23] public city about it. only the local
[1:59:27] newspaper carry it
[1:59:30] that something happened when a when a
[1:59:32] Baptist preacher everybody took their
[1:59:34] own story about it
[1:59:38] but God was building in troubles time
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; he was building a man
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; that would step out of the Baptist
[1:59:51] church because he would deny woman
[1:59:53] preaching
[1:59:55] a man that will read a Bible and saw
[1:59:58] that baptisming is done in in Jesus'
[2:00:00] name and go to his Baptist pastor and
[2:00:03] say baptize me in Jesus name. Baptist do
[2:00:06] it in father, son, and the holy ghost.
[2:00:08] But you baptize me in Jesus name because
[2:00:10] the Bible said that is the way it is
[2:00:12] done.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's what God was doing. He was
[2:00:18] building a man
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; with all the opposition.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Society was against him because he
[2:00:26] never had good education. His father was
[2:00:28] a drunk. But God was building a man.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; God was using that to build a man.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; You that want to be built on s platter.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Every little thing we back up, we cry.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Character is not built in the head.
[2:00:52] Character is built by the things you
[2:00:54] experience.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; It's not built by your reasoning.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; You don't go to school to learn
[2:00:59] character.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:14] God was building the man. Hallelujah.
[2:01:21] say, "Oh, Billy, you're having a
[2:01:22] nightmare." He's talking to to his to
[2:01:26] his uh his his Baptist pastor about all
[2:01:29] of this vision that he's having.
[2:01:32] You say you need to get sleep. You're
[2:01:34] not sleeping.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; And he's he's not understanding it.
[2:01:43] But God is building
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; in trouble time.
[2:01:48] That's what Daniel said.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; The walls and the streets of Jerusalem
[2:01:53] will be built in troubleous time.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; They will be holding bricks in their
[2:01:58] hands
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; and swore on the other side.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; They are ready to fight for what they
[2:02:03] believe.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; They're ready to die for what they
[2:02:06] believe.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, fight for it.
[2:02:16] complain, make excuses, and look for
[2:02:18] somebody to blame.
[2:02:25] Are we together?
[2:02:28] Hallelujah.
[2:02:29] Amen. right between the time of 1933
[2:02:34] and uh uh uh and 1946.
[2:02:38] 1933 was the Ohio River. 1946 was in the
[2:02:42] cave where the angel came and gave him
[2:02:44] his commission.
[2:02:47] Look at that. You you think about that.
[2:02:50] Think about that. Let's let's little
[2:02:51] trouble comes. You know people they go
[2:02:54] away from church
[2:02:56] now.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; But think about it. The war came in
[2:03:00] between Ohio River and the commission.
[2:03:04] The war was 19 h 39 to 1945.
[2:03:12] It would have been a time where the
[2:03:14] young preacher
[2:03:16] will be trying to find a better life for
[2:03:18] he and his family. Yeah,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; but I mean he was so consumed by this
[2:03:22] divine gift that was in his life. This
[2:03:25] vision that was happening and he wanted
[2:03:27] to know what is this all about.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; There is war going on. War is happening
[2:03:32] in the entire world. And you mean you
[2:03:34] are just concerned about your spiritual
[2:03:37] life because that's your real life.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Your spiritual life is your real life
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; or the other one is fake.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; They will perish.
[2:03:51] Praise the Lord. Right in between there,
[2:03:54] he's not attracted. This is the same
[2:03:56] voice that spoke to me at 7 years old.
[2:03:59] This is the same thing that's been
[2:04:00] haunting me. Dreams and visions.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; He had the seven last vision of
[2:04:09] everything of all this technology thing
[2:04:11] that we are seeing. All your driverless
[2:04:13] car was revealed to him in 1933. He's
[2:04:16] having all of those visions.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; He's trouble about it.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; But yet the entire world is dealing with
[2:04:24] Hitler. Hitler killing Jews, sending
[2:04:26] them to concentration camp and all of
[2:04:28] those things are happening.
[2:04:32] Bombs are flying. Things are are
[2:04:34] bursting everywhere. But here is this
[2:04:36] young Baptist preacher. Trouble.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; What kind of a life is this?
[2:04:43] Why am I different from everybody?
[2:04:47] All the question is in his mind
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; because God's building is different.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; God's material is different.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; When God is building a man is different.
[2:05:01] When he's building a family is
[2:05:03] different.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; You don't mash your family with
[2:05:06] Hollywood. You mash it with God's word.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:13] Amen.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Not a mega church where we say okay I if
[2:05:21] we bring disco light let's make blue and
[2:05:23] white you know the light be blinging it
[2:05:26] make the people to be dancing.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[2:05:32] What is that? What is the benefit? We
[2:05:35] just dance and sweat
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; and then we go from here empty.
[2:05:43] Praise the Lord. What's the benefit?
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God said, "We come to
[2:05:51] church to become better people."
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; We come to the house of God to become
[2:05:58] better people.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:06] Well, I I mean I don't know what's going
[2:06:07] on with you this morning, but
[2:06:11] I think uh
[2:06:13] the Lord is good. Amen.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord is good. The shout of the
[2:06:19] king is in the camp.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:25] Oh, mine.
[2:06:27] Oh my. Oh my.
[2:06:30] Oh my. Ezekiel chapter 45. I just read
[2:06:33] something this morning.
[2:06:37] Praise the Lord. I need to stop
[2:06:39] preaching.
[2:06:41] I really need
[2:06:44] I need to stop taking your time and just
[2:06:46] get to my message this morning.
[2:06:51] See what the prophet Ezekiel say.
[2:06:55] Ezekiel chapter 46.
[2:06:59] Did I say 45? No, 46. I should not be
[2:07:03] lying on the pulpit.
[2:07:08] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:10] Ezekiel chapter 46. Let's uh let's just
[2:07:12] read something here and see uh what what
[2:07:15] the the Lord is telling the people here.
[2:07:17] But Ezekiel, then we'll get back into
[2:07:18] our message. Verse 9. And when the
[2:07:20] people of the land shall come before the
[2:07:23] Lord in the solemn feast,
[2:07:27] he that enterth in by the way of the
[2:07:30] north gate to worship shall go out by
[2:07:34] the way of the south gate gate. Praise
[2:07:37] the Lord.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; You cannot go back the way you came.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. No, you can't go back
[2:07:49] the way you came. The prophet said it.
[2:07:52] Ezekiel said it.
[2:07:56] When you come in by the north, you must
[2:07:58] go out by the south.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; When you come by the south, you must go
[2:08:02] by the north. You can't go back the way
[2:08:05] you came.
[2:08:08] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Which mean you just stop at the church.
[2:08:12] You really did not enter his presence.
[2:08:16] You can just stop at the church, sit,
[2:08:19] feel comfortable, enjoy the AC, and
[2:08:22] sleep. But when you enter his presence,
[2:08:25] you can never go the way you came.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Well, let's get back to preaching.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, you love the Lord.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. He
[2:08:39] is worth water to be praised.
[2:08:44] Hallelujah.
[2:08:49] And here is here to what uh uh uh uh uh
[2:08:53] John is telling us here in in Revelation
[2:08:55] chapter 11. The second world war is
[2:08:57] passed and behold the ter comes quickly.
[2:09:01] So we see that
[2:09:04] the prophecy of these of these three
[2:09:07] wars of Revelation chapter 8 is
[2:09:09] fulfilling in our time. Yeah,
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; right from the 19th century year and
[2:09:16] year say the whole world is now balling
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; with what is happening in the Middle
[2:09:21] East and what is happening in Russia and
[2:09:23] all of the the whole world is balling.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; The crowd of this angel that after the
[2:09:30] second wall the tear is going to come
[2:09:32] quickly.
[2:09:40] Do you see the time that we are in? You
[2:09:42] see the h it's not more about the time.
[2:09:46] But what I want to grab your attention
[2:09:48] on this morning, people, oh my God, I
[2:09:50] pray that the Lord can really help us.
[2:09:52] Amen. That it will not just be uh you
[2:09:55] know uh h a kind of a lecture, but
[2:09:57] something that will have an impact on
[2:09:59] you and you'll be able to think about
[2:10:01] it. You just think about it. All of the
[2:10:04] time that you have been born, all your
[2:10:06] years on earth has been under the
[2:10:08] influence of these wolves.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; There is nobody here yet that was born
[2:10:16] 1909. So I can say that with the virtue
[2:10:18] of all the years you have spent on this
[2:10:21] earth
[2:10:23] has been influenced by these wars.
[2:10:29] We are the people that were born in
[2:10:31] troubleous time.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Some of you have not seen the trouble of
[2:10:39] wars or the trouble of farming,
[2:10:43] the trouble of earthquake.
[2:10:47] You watch them on your phone, you say,
[2:10:49] "Oh, wow. Oh, man."
[2:10:57] But all your life on earth has been
[2:11:00] under the influence of these three
[2:11:02] walls.
[2:11:04] If the scripture remains the truth
[2:11:09] and honor of these three walls, God
[2:11:12] birthed the greatest ministry. He
[2:11:14] birthed the greatest move of God. On
[2:11:17] these three walls, God be moving
[2:11:19] mightily in the earth seven times around
[2:11:22] the world. Amen.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; A message that has affected shake every
[2:11:26] nation under heaven
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; until one time the the Russian
[2:11:35] government started putting their eyes on
[2:11:37] voice of God
[2:11:41] because of how the message was spreading
[2:11:43] through that country.
[2:11:47] Praise the Lord. Communism has stood in
[2:11:50] China. But yet the message has break in
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; all of these walls. But yet God,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is moving like a magnet.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; He's moving here. He's moving there.
[2:12:04] He's moving almost about everywhere.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Pulling his ellets out
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; on a h a tribal conflict. Amen.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is still saving souls.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; On a save a wall.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Some of us we got saved,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; we received the Holy Ghost on a save a
[2:12:30] wall.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? I know what
[2:12:33] I'm talking about.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; My my my birth to this message and all
[2:12:39] of my years has been on a wall. I have I
[2:12:42] have had them everywhere.
[2:12:44] Amen.
[2:12:45] I ran from one ran into another one.
[2:12:48] Praise the Lord. I I hope I don't bring
[2:12:51] war to Minnesota.
[2:12:53] It looks like I don't know whether I'm
[2:12:55] the one carrying it or he's coming after
[2:12:57] me.
[2:13:01] But I'm I just trying to grab your
[2:13:02] attention this morning. All out all of
[2:13:05] our existence,
[2:13:09] we have been able to to go to school.
[2:13:13] It has not been a perfect word.
[2:13:16] The world has not really been quiet.
[2:13:22] If it is not happening in your backyard,
[2:13:24] don't think that the whole world looks
[2:13:26] like your backyard.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:48] What are we talking about people
[2:13:54] in trouble time? Every every war, every
[2:13:57] conflict, every conflict,
[2:14:00] every conflict, every disagreement you
[2:14:03] have ever had in your life was
[2:14:05] influenced by one of these three walls.
[2:14:11] Every disagreement, every evil thought
[2:14:14] that have ever bothered you,
[2:14:17] praise the Lord, it was just one little
[2:14:20] demon that was born that was slapped.
[2:14:22] Amen. Mama slap that little demon and it
[2:14:24] come bugging your mind.
[2:14:28] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:34] Sometimes we just think is we we are
[2:14:36] making things by our own choices.
[2:14:40] There are sometimes when these uh uh uh
[2:14:43] uh uh uh uh things get attached to our
[2:14:46] spirit then it become wars that we fight
[2:14:49] all through our lives.
[2:14:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:55] Amen. It become wars that we fight all
[2:14:58] through our life.
[2:15:02] When the lion spirit catch a little
[2:15:03] child or a lustful demon
[2:15:15] but in the midst of this,
[2:15:18] that's what I want to get your attention
[2:15:19] to.
[2:15:27] Behold, the second wall, the tail war
[2:15:29] comes quickly
[2:15:35] and we see the nations are breeding to
[2:15:37] death.
[2:15:39] We see the things that are happening.
[2:15:42] But that's not where I want to I want to
[2:15:43] grab your mind this morning.
[2:15:46] What I want to show you is God in
[2:15:50] simplicity,
[2:15:51] he's building a people.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; God is building a racket
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; that's going to fly in the twinkling of
[2:16:00] an eye.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; God is conditioning a people.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; He's changing the atoms of our body.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You that feel so heavy
[2:16:12] to say amen and jump up,
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; you better get that thing working. Let
[2:16:16] the grace of God grease your wheels.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Behold, the tail wall comes quickly. But
[2:16:29] yes, God on a countdown. He's on a
[2:16:33] countdown.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; He's on a countdown and he's preparing
[2:16:37] the people. A little yet, a little
[2:16:40] there.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; See what he did to that uh h prophet
[2:16:47] messenger.
[2:16:48] He's too alone. All the theologians and
[2:16:52] all of these men and go Lancet and all
[2:16:54] of these guys around, they could not
[2:16:56] understand his ministry.
[2:16:59] This man have such a gift that he could
[2:17:01] have sweeped the whole world off their
[2:17:04] feet.
[2:17:05] Yeah.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; They say he was he he's very
[2:17:08] disorganized.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; A man that will leave an entire
[2:17:12] convention. He say I have to go to
[2:17:14] Minneapolis.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; He had to come down and see God in h God
[2:17:20] in Peterson in this city. He says the
[2:17:22] the the angel of the Lord tell me get
[2:17:24] down to Minneapolis or else the
[2:17:26] Pentecostal people will be in trouble.
[2:17:28] He forsoke the entire meeting.
[2:17:32] It disorganized the organizers. People
[2:17:34] don't do things like this. Will Brandon
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; He was not really an organized man
[2:17:49] because sons of God are led by the
[2:17:51] spirit of God.
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:58] when he tried to follow their
[2:17:59] organization in South Africa, he got
[2:18:01] himself in trouble
[2:18:05] and he and and he got uh he got ammo. He
[2:18:08] got sick almost to death. And he told
[2:18:11] those brothers, he says he he told them
[2:18:13] uh uh uh uh he told all of these
[2:18:15] brothers uh uh what is his name? E F
[2:18:17] Boswave. He says uh he says, "Brother
[2:18:19] Bosov, I'm telling you, we will go the
[2:18:22] way that you brothers have planned, but
[2:18:23] every one of us are going to pay for
[2:18:25] it." He said, "Because that's not the
[2:18:28] way God said that this meeting are
[2:18:30] supposed to be. I'm supposed to get down
[2:18:32] to Derban and be with Sandy Jackson."
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; They said, "No, brother Brandon, the way
[2:18:40] the meeting was planned, you're supposed
[2:18:42] to leave from Johannesburg and you're
[2:18:44] supposed to go up this way, get down to
[2:18:45] Cape Town and all of that." He says,
[2:18:47] "Okay, if that's the way y'all want to
[2:18:49] go, let's go. But I'm telling you, every
[2:18:50] one of us will pay for it."
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; And we are God's sake.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; And yet we sit down. We sit down hearing
[2:19:05] these things
[2:19:07] and it does not even shake us.
[2:19:11] It don't even shake us.
[2:19:17] They have just turned now to be a
[2:19:18] slogan. The prophecy. The prophecy.
[2:19:25] We take the one that suit us.
[2:19:31] But the truth is a mighty hunter.
[2:19:34] The truth do not miss. When it target
[2:19:38] you,
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; it don't miss. Try to dodge, it will get
[2:19:41] you under your bed.
[2:19:44] Praise the Lord. One time Ahab tried to
[2:19:47] dodge the truth. He disguised himself in
[2:19:50] battle.
[2:19:52] Praise the Lord. While Jo Jehoshaphat
[2:19:56] was dressing like a king, Ahab decided
[2:19:58] to dress himself like a nominal man
[2:20:00] because he says, "I don't want the
[2:20:01] Syrians to see me." Syrians were not
[2:20:03] looking for him. That prophecy was
[2:20:04] looking for him
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; because Elijah said the dogs will lick
[2:20:08] your blood.
[2:20:10] That's it.
[2:20:18] What are we saying church?
[2:20:22] Amen. That's the reason why we don't get
[2:20:24] it so easy. Just at a time when it looks
[2:20:27] like everything is growing and you
[2:20:28] realize all sorts of problem is breaking
[2:20:30] up everywhere. Children misbehaving,
[2:20:32] family having problem. It looks like uh
[2:20:35] where is the church?
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; But just in the midst of that,
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; When we pay attention and we dress back
[2:20:44] and say, "Lord, what's going on? What's
[2:20:46] happening to this church? What is going
[2:20:48] on?"
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't worry. I'm building in
[2:20:51] troubleous time.
[2:20:53] I'm I'm I'm putting some cornerstone
[2:20:55] somewhere. I'm I'm I'm I'm prepping this
[2:20:58] thing up.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; I say I will build my church and the
[2:21:02] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[2:21:04] it."
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:10] When you think you are misbehaving, I'm
[2:21:12] lifting my heads up onto the hills,
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; welcoming my help.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I said, God, if this is
[2:21:19] your work, raise up men that will rise
[2:21:22] up to the challenge.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Have people that will come and just be
[2:21:25] spectators.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; He be in troublesome time.
[2:21:38] Glory be to God.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Just at the birth of Jesus, a gospel
[2:21:46] pass a tax problem. Everybody go to your
[2:21:48] village. At the time where the world was
[2:21:50] supposed to be born
[2:21:54] at the time where the Christ child,
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; it was chaos everywhere.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody going by the let's go. We got
[2:22:01] to go to Judah. Oh, we got to go to
[2:22:02] Beth. Everybody running up and down.
[2:22:06] But God got a man
[2:22:08] and said, "Joseph, fear not
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; to take Mary as your wife, for that
[2:22:13] thing that is conceived in her is of the
[2:22:15] Holy Ghost."
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; He was building in troubleous time.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; He was ready to put his repetition on
[2:22:24] the line.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Call me what what you want to call me.
[2:22:28] The angel said, "This child is of the
[2:22:30] Holy Ghost. I believe it."
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you imagine the
[2:22:35] passing is seeing a Mary paper on the
[2:22:38] her of picture on the newspaper a girl
[2:22:40] that say angel visit her
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; and Joseph had to look at that when he
[2:22:43] know that is his wife
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; but you see no matter what is on the
[2:22:48] internet is different from what is in my
[2:22:50] heart
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; what God has placed in your heart is
[2:22:53] greater than what is on the internet is
[2:22:55] greater than what is in the newspaper is
[2:22:57] greater than whoever say
[2:23:00] the thing that hold you is what God has
[2:23:02] revealed to
[2:23:09] Praise the Lord.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:23:23] No matter what you're going through, no
[2:23:25] matter what you feel in your body, what
[2:23:27] your mind tells you. Praise the Lord.
[2:23:30] You know when God spoke about the the
[2:23:32] the the the sixth sense, the sixth sense
[2:23:34] is not part of your mental sense. The
[2:23:37] six sense is a fifth sense.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; It's only your soul that has the fifth
[2:23:42] the six sense. Your brain will never get
[2:23:44] the six sense.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; The sixth sense is a sense of the soul.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So no matter what your
[2:23:56] body is going through, Amen. If you are
[2:24:00] able to take God by his word,
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; Like ain't G mama. She knew that God
[2:24:08] never fail. She said, "Lord, I am that
[2:24:11] widow woman. Where is your Elijah?"
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; And she came out and she was just
[2:24:17] hanging there and just standing.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; The dew of the morning falling on her.
[2:24:21] She knew that God never fail. Amen.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; She knew that he's an ontime God.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; He may not come the time, you know, I I
[2:24:30] want him, but he will be on time.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; She stood right there. And here is this
[2:24:36] white man passing in a black
[2:24:38] neighborhood
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; at a time where the nation was on a
[2:24:43] racial crisis.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Passing,
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; glory be to God."
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; She's a person.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; He check. He says he check.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; How did you know I was a person
[2:25:08] now? It was her faith that drew him
[2:25:10] there.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; It was not a vision that carried him
[2:25:12] there. It was not a divine gift. It was
[2:25:15] a faith of an old widow woman that
[2:25:18] believed God, took God at his word. She
[2:25:22] did not know the seal. She didn't know
[2:25:24] about Malachi fall. But she knew that
[2:25:26] God honor his word.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; The thing where we want to make
[2:25:34] everything about Malachi 4. God was God
[2:25:36] before Malachi 4. He wrote re he wrote
[2:25:39] Genesis before Malachi. He wrote Isaiah
[2:25:42] before Malachi.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:25:45] forever.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; She knew that God was God.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:52] Hallelujah.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Jack said, "How do you know I
[2:25:57] was a person?"
[2:26:00] Praise the Lord. Because he didn't even
[2:26:02] know where he was going.
[2:26:04] The Lord just said, "Go."
[2:26:07] He didn't know where he was going, who
[2:26:09] he was going to.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:22] You love the Lord.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; My my my what a wonderful Jesus we
[2:26:29] serve.
[2:26:31] Hallelujah.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:36] But when she was having troubles time
[2:26:38] her own a son baby
[2:26:42] she said I was just like that widow
[2:26:44] woman and God gave me this child. He
[2:26:47] went away pastor. He's a good boy, but
[2:26:50] he followed the wrong crowd.
[2:26:53] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:26:57] But Bam says she when she got down to
[2:26:59] pray, he knew. He knew that this woman
[2:27:02] talked to God.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not just a religious woman.
[2:27:07] She's not putting up. She's somebody
[2:27:09] that have talked to God.
[2:27:22] In the midst of that,
[2:27:24] in the midst of trouble, it's it's a
[2:27:27] it's it's a mysterious thing. Look
[2:27:29] through the scripture.
[2:27:31] Praise the Lord. In the midst of
[2:27:34] trouble, there here is those three boys
[2:27:36] standing before the whole nation. All
[2:27:39] those Jewish believers, the message of
[2:27:41] the our believers that was in bapt, they
[2:27:43] are all backslided.
[2:27:46] There is these three boys standing and
[2:27:48] says that we will not bow down.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that Daniel was not among
[2:27:55] them?
[2:27:57] Praise the Lord. But Daniel was in
[2:28:00] Babylon,
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; but he was not among them.
[2:28:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:28:08] They didn't send and say well let's send
[2:28:10] message to Daniel let's ask Daniel
[2:28:11] whether we should bow down or not you
[2:28:13] know because they image they have made
[2:28:14] it in the name of Daniel so let's
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; they had their conviction they were
[2:28:21] standing for what they knew to be true
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; we will not bow down
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; we are not careful in this matter
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; it could have been easy for God to just
[2:28:33] come down there change the mind of the
[2:28:34] people
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; he wait for trouble time
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; when the fire was heated seven times.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; That's when God show up.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, God don't show up when you feeling
[2:28:47] sorry for yourself.
[2:28:49] [Music]
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Amen.
[2:29:06] That's that's how God build.
[2:29:08] Amen. That's how he build because he
[2:29:11] don't want the enemy to grab his plan
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; when he's when he's putting his
[2:29:16] materials in the building. He don't want
[2:29:17] the devil to know what he's using.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; So he will build when you going through
[2:29:23] trouble.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; And we can say like Job do he's slaying
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; yet I would trust him.
[2:29:35] Praise the Lord. I was talking to that
[2:29:38] young sister there that I mean those
[2:29:40] those people just like children to me
[2:29:43] and Solomon he's he's just like my boy
[2:29:46] you know uh uh I mean uh Bas Solomon
[2:29:48] back there 1994 uh in in Yakipa he
[2:29:52] traveled with me to the Har co and I was
[2:29:54] talking to the wife there on the loss of
[2:29:56] their children you know I told her I
[2:29:57] says I said this this will be the
[2:29:59] difficult thing for you where your
[2:30:02] challenge will be is if you can trust
[2:30:05] God.
[2:30:07] Can you trust God when you heard your
[2:30:10] children crying in the burning house and
[2:30:13] you couldn't save them? Can you trust
[2:30:16] God?
[2:30:19] I said that's where your life battle
[2:30:22] will be.
[2:30:24] Because you have every reason.

[2:31:03] everything.

[2:36:45] in Jesus
[2:36:48] or to trust.
[2:36:50] And
[2:36:53] let's pray together this afternoon.
[2:36:57] On Wednesday night, we were speaking
[2:36:59] about the death of a of of a cow, how he
[2:37:03] dies, the man that is afraid, and the
[2:37:06] man that is h
[2:37:09] an age that is just filling us with
[2:37:11] bunch of uh the thoughts of cowardness
[2:37:15] and so easy to back up and throw the
[2:37:17] towing and and we don't even know
[2:37:19] values. We don't know values. Our our
[2:37:23] skill of value is out of balance.
[2:37:27] We don't know what to put first. We
[2:37:30] don't know what to put major. We are
[2:37:32] majoring on a minor
[2:37:38] an age that is that is not that that has
[2:37:40] just been affected
[2:37:43] because a generation you think about how
[2:37:46] people live before 1914.
[2:37:50] Go back and see how they live. honor the
[2:37:53] comm. They didn't have the kind of
[2:37:55] hospitals and technology we have. They
[2:37:58] live longer. They live healthier. They
[2:38:01] live happy.
[2:38:03] They were a support to one another.
[2:38:06] People those days were working for less
[2:38:09] less and the the the value of the
[2:38:11] currency the things have weight and
[2:38:14] money. But yet we say we come on the
[2:38:17] curses of these three wars.
[2:38:21] Three wars affecting every government on
[2:38:24] the earth. We're talking about this
[2:38:25] government is corrupt and that
[2:38:27] government is corrupt. Just let's look
[2:38:29] at the bigger picture.
[2:38:32] Look at the bigger picture.
[2:38:35] We are all under this influence.
[2:38:38] Almighty God by his mercy, he has
[2:38:41] reached down his hands to sneak your
[2:38:44] life out to grab your attention and say,
[2:38:47] "My child, look at me." the community
[2:38:50] the the the inconment of this world will
[2:38:52] fail but I will never fail you.
[2:38:55] I'm the Lord that will heal you of all
[2:38:57] your diseases
[2:38:59] but yet we can't trust him. It's so hard
[2:39:02] for us to trust him.
[2:39:05] We keep looking to fueling systems
[2:39:08] around us.
[2:39:10] Oh God.
[2:39:13] Oh God.
[2:39:17] [Music]
[2:39:24] He have kept us.
[2:39:27] Grab some of us. Some of you young
[2:39:29] people. Grab you in the in in the
[2:39:32] innocences of your life. The virgines of
[2:39:35] your life to keep you
[2:39:38] not to experience all the abuses that is
[2:39:41] out there. He kept you
[2:39:44] and give you a family. Now you want to
[2:39:46] think that you have the family and you
[2:39:48] can run it the way you want to run it. I
[2:39:51] say shame on you. I would say shame on
[2:39:54] you.
[2:39:57] God built you for this moment. He built
[2:40:01] you
[2:40:03] for that home. He build you
[2:40:09] to be a builder in the life of your
[2:40:11] wife, to be a builder in the life of
[2:40:13] your husband.
[2:40:20] God will take us from different places
[2:40:23] and bring us down to a church
[2:40:26] that went many years to find a pastor
[2:40:29] and yet he will bring us together
[2:40:32] and we will just come and then we just
[2:40:33] want to sneak in sneak out. You don't
[2:40:35] even know the reason why you are here.
[2:40:41] How are you? How are you involved? Where
[2:40:44] is your shoulder to the wheels?
[2:40:49] Are you seeing that this is the place I
[2:40:51] bring my family?
[2:40:54] Can you take a time by yourself and
[2:40:56] says, "I would stick my face to the
[2:40:58] ground and pray for the church."
[2:41:01] We keep looking over our shoulders and
[2:41:03] looking for what to complain about.
[2:41:05] [Music]
[2:41:15] Oh God, raise up men, man that would be
[2:41:19] like Neimas
[2:41:20] that would go before the king and ask
[2:41:23] for a day off. He went before his bus.
[2:41:27] He said, "Give me a day off. We have a
[2:41:29] convention in in Jerusalem. I want a day
[2:41:32] off. I want to get down to Jerusalem. I
[2:41:35] heard how the walls are building."
[2:41:40] [Music]
[2:41:41] We find excuses to make. How did you
[2:41:43] survive?
[2:41:46] We are spitting in the face of grace
[2:41:51] that flesh us out.
[2:41:54] [Music]
[2:42:03] This is God's work. And God will raise
[2:42:06] up men to build his work. He will raise
[2:42:09] up men to build his house.
[2:42:12] He does not rely on the arm of flesh
[2:42:14] because the arm of flesh fails.
[2:42:17] The arm of the Lord never fails.
[2:42:22] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[2:42:25] Thank you Jesus.
[2:42:28] Thank you Jesus.
[2:42:32] Thank you Jesus. My soul has found a
[2:42:35] resting place. Let's sing there before
[2:42:37] we pray.
