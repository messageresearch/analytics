Let's just bow our heads. Uh we have some few prayer leads we want to share with you. But we want first want to bring a praise report. Uh we thank the Lord. Uh I think it was on um Monday. Brother Wesley called that sister Carol was not doing well. They had to rush her to the hospital and she was animated dead uh uh with her blood pressure uh skyrocketing and she was losing her speech and some different things going on. But we want to thank the Lord she's back home. Amen. She's back home. We want to thank the Lord for that. We want to thank the Lord for intervening. So when he called me, I was just uh or when I spoke to him, I was just in in a place of speaking to brother forest farmer because I'm I'm hoping that he will be here with us the first first week in uh November. That's November 1st and 2nd. He should be speaking for us that weekend. And it's been a while that we have not har forest. Amen. So uh we were, you know, about to talk to him. So then I call him and then I was just sharing with him. He says, he says, "Brother War is surprising because I was listening to brother Don Reagan service on Saturday and there were a couple of prayer requests for some sisters that have blood pressure. Sunday morning I go to church and they had requestes of some sisters that have blood pressure. So he says the devil might be bringing blood pressures attack on our sisters." Amen. So uh we just we just took that to the Lord in prayer and we want to thank God that he came through for sister Carol. Amen. Let's take this other prayer need. I got it uh serious prayer request here. This individual should be in the hospital and uh I'm still looking for update on the condition uh for uh uh Daniel Gray sister Kelly. She was in a bad accident accident accident crash a t-bone.

She's uh in a conculion and neck brace. Uh they ask uh They are asking which mean those sending the prayer request they asking for physical healing but also for spiritual healing. Amen. So I thought that I needed to remember this uh as we as we bring this uh to the Lord in prayer. Amen. Let's just also bow our heads together tonight and uh give thanks. Let's give thanks for the the uh opportunity of being in the house of the Lord and thank God for our dear sister Cara. And we just appreciate the Lord for all his goodness, all his love and mercy.

He said, "Lord, if there be one righteous, and I believe that because of the righteous that is in the land, because of the bride of Jesus Christ, because of God's people that want to stand for his name, that want to live right and do right, I believe that God can save the city. I believe that God can just give us a time once again that we can be that we can be able to just shine his light So whatever the Lord place on your heart tonight, let's just take this time and just pray that God will be merciful. He will help his children. It's not time to be caught up in politics. It's not time to be caught up in in everything that is happening out there.

God is so good. He's so good. He's the lover of my soul. He's the giver of life. Revelation chapter 5. Let's take our Bibles tonight. On Sunday, we were speaking on uh the rathers and the beast. Amen. &gt;&gt; The rathers and the beast. So, uh, we want to continue a little bit in that line tonight and, uh, if it will please the Lord to be able to remind us of what we were speaking about and, uh, and and just, uh, maybe encourage us tonight. Amen. Revelation chapter 5, let's read from verse one. And I saw in the hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within, and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose their seals thereof. And no man in heaven known in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on. And one of the the others said unto me, "Weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we want to thank you, Lord God, for your prevailing angel. Thank you for your prevailing presence, oh God. Father, Almighty Lord, I pray tonight that Lord God, you will just uh come now, Father, Lord, put us aside, come out of the pages of your word. Let something be said that would draw us closer to you. We love you because you first love us. What a mighty God. What a blessed Lord we serve. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Amen. Amen. And uh uh if you want to find out if I had a good day today, yes I did. Amen. There were a few things that uh uh you know uh that that really brightened my day and one of them and uh uh was uh I was just about leaving here and uh to head home uh uh and just uh get myself ready for service tonight. And then uh um Sister Bea came uh Sister Bea, she's uh uh helping a Muslim family and uh uh and I've I've always wanted to talk to the lady and because uh uh I've just seen social social kindness, you know, social kindness and uh uh I mean being very kind, very nice to our sister. So I I've always wanted to so I've missed her a couple of times. She's either driving out when I'm coming in and uh the other time I was very close. So I thought she wait for me but she was as soon I got out of my car she just drove and and left. So I'm saying okay uh maybe the Lord will give us enough time and which of course he did today. And but she told me she was she was she was running for an appointment. She saw me coming but she was running for an appointment. She never wanted to get laid, so that's why she just drove away. I thought she was in front of me anyway. Praise the Lord. No, I just uh I just uh uh didn't know what was what actually was. So, so I just I just stopped by and I talked with her a little bit and I just told her, "Thank you. Thank you for being nice, you know, to uh to our our sister, you know, uh she speaks highly of you and and I see the, you know, the sacrifice because she live there in Savage, you know, she brings sister Peter there. Make sure she gets here early for church or you know enough time for her to come and and uh uh you know and and being a Muslim family uh you know and just to see the way that they respect her faith, they respect her prayer time and and all of that. So all of those things were were things that uh you know every time she would tell me I would tell her well I don't know what's what is there but I I just think there is something you know uh that God is doing. I can tell what what is there but it was good to talk to the lady today. So and uh uh so I went up to her and greet her and just told her thank you and she said she told me she said no she says oh well you know she's she's my mother. She came into my life just when I've lost my mother. And uh uh you know and that that explained a whole lot and uh uh but but again unless you have been around a little bit unless uh you know uh uh uh certain group of people you would just see that there is just something you know uh uh there is just something special. What is it? We don't want to put interpretation to it, but you can just tell that it has it have to be God. Amen. It have to be God. And that really really really blessed my heart. Praise the Lord. Really blessed my heart because uh uh uh yeah, I I'll leave it. I'll leave it as that. So that was one of the thing that make me happy today. Amen. That's one of the thing that that make me happy today. So, tonight I want to I want to uh get back to what we've been talking about uh continue in in the line of thought of the the rather and the beast and uh uh I will take this uh first quote for you. Uh we will see Jesus is something that we uh we are familiar familiar with. We will see Jesus. Now remember God take his man but never his spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So if you if you take that in in the land of thought wave the rathers you know uh uh one man goes uh you know the same spirit continue and pick up another man you know and it continue and it continue. So uh that's that's the reason why I throw I throw this there. Remember God take his man but never his spirit. The devil takes his man but never his spirit. The same spirit was on Elijah came on Elisha. Same one was on Elisha came on John the Baptist. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. 800 years later, the Holy Spirit that was on Christ come on the church &gt;&gt; and will and will remain until Jesus come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray that. So So we can identify our rather. &gt;&gt; Who is our rather? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Who is our rather? The Holy Spirit. Jesus is our rather in the form of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are his be. He is our rabbit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So if you if you look at it also, you can see uh uh uh you know uh uh why the Elijah promise have restoration because what the spirit is riding four times. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is actually riding four times after Elijah the teacher. When the spirit leaves him, he riding full time. And that is the principle of restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he's caught, he must restore four times. So you can see why the the the uh restoration, the promise of restoration is attached to the ministry of Elijah because uh uh uh is is is wrapped in the principle. Praise the Lord. Now, so tonight, uh, I I read from Revelation chapter 5. I I want you to pay attention to, I mean, what we've been trying to bring to you. uh uh and uh uh we started at Revelation chapter 6, but I felt like it was it was a kind of a incomplete uh uh thing because when you talk about the rather uh uh Emanuel, if you'll put my picture up for me, please. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, so uh if you if you read in Revelation chapter 4 where we read on Sunday, it was mostly trying to identify this beast. It was trying to identify this beast. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6 that we read last uh uh uh last Wednesday uh was mostly talking about this. Even though we have one of the four B said come and see. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So on Sunday what we were trying to do was that we were trying to identify because uh we read this I read this to you on Sunday. Mark of the beast uh brother Brandham said watch this beast. It have four different characters in it. So we were looking at the characteristics of these beasts and to be able to find their characteristics uh uh we we identify that they are the the the influence that is upon them keep them around the throne. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Revelation chapter 4 they were around the throne. &gt;&gt; These beasts are not around the throne. &gt;&gt; These ones are coming from the bottomless pit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are around the throne. So you go to Revelation chapter 5. You also see them around the throne. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this is where this is where it's going to get interesting tonight because when you look in Revelation chapter 5, just like we have read, the strong angel proclaimed, "No man is walting." Verse four, I wept much because no man was found wanting to open the book and to read, neither to look there on. And one of the elders said unto me, "Wepth, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The other says the lion of the tribe of Judah. And we found out that the lion is also one of the beasts. &gt;&gt; Now, you got to pay attention to this. Now, amen. &gt;&gt; Because uh uh if if you don't if you don't pay attention, you you'll be you misunderstand me. If you remember, I don't know, we we spoke on this back when we were talking about the return of the dove. Amen. When we were talking about the return of the do because that's what I want to go to tonight and to to be able to remind you and clarify uh uh our thoughts on that. When we were talking about the return of the dove, we said the dove will only come on a lamin nature. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The dove will only come on the lamb in nature. But we realize here the elder told John that the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. And verse six, and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts. In the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, because these four beasts are always around the throne. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The elder said what? The lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You have to follow that. He says the lion has prevailed. But when John looked, &gt;&gt; he saw a lamb. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When John looked, he saw a lamb. The lion was not there, but the lion has prevailed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And what prevail means? What do prevail means? &gt;&gt; That's what it means. Prevail means to overcome. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, let's let's read this from the from the message the bridge. Let's read it from the bridge. If you if you put that up for me. Uh uh. And John started crying because no one was walting and no one could even look at the book. Oh, it took a human being John because no one could do it and everything was lost. And there came a voice from one of the others standing in the midst of the four beasts. and all the great host of heaven. Don't weep, John. Oh mine, the grace of God. Don't be brokenhearted, John. Don't weep for the lion of the trap of Judah, the root and the offspring of David, he has prevailed. Prevail means to russle with and overcome. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prevail means to wrestle with and overcome. Now, so put my image back up. So you see that uh each of these anointing was rrestling with this &gt;&gt; in every age &gt;&gt; for the believer for us to overcome. &gt;&gt; God gave an anointing &gt;&gt; that will wrestle with this spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why you can be tempted. You get you deliver and again it come back and tempt you. that there is an anointing that is wrestling with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and in every age it was said to him that overcome. &gt;&gt; To him that prevail. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To him that prevail. Now it looks like you know what oh Satan I rebuke you. I I I you know I I I rebuke you. I condemn the spirit and all of that. It's it's it's beautiful. All of those exercise is beautiful. &gt;&gt; But the thing that is making you to overcome is this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the anointing you are under. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Leave this word. You see how your life will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing that is making you to overcome &gt;&gt; is this anointing. &gt;&gt; Leave the word. You will see how your life will be. &gt;&gt; That's right. There is nothing in you &gt;&gt; to stand this &gt;&gt; evil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This was the anointing that make 6 million Jews were killed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This very anointing that that that killed believers through the ages. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The other said, John, we've met. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lion of the trap of Judah has prevailed. But when John looked, he saw a lamb. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was looking for the lion and he saw a lamb. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So when we talk when we spoke on the return of the dove, what we were dealing with is there because the dove will only come on a lamin nature. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we said that uh each of these beasts each each of these anointing they were the anointing. They were the the defense force of God for the truth church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The dove will not come on the lion. The dove will only come on the lion when the lion has a lamb nature. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are looking at the anointing and we are also looking at the nature. Because a man can has the anointing anointed one at the end time. Brother Brandon was saying that there are people that will come under this this anointing. They can get anointed but their nature is not changed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see the other says the lion has prevailed. Amen. An anointing has gone forth. &gt;&gt; But when you are looking for the for for the anointing that has gone forth, you must look for the nature. &gt;&gt; Because the anointing that has gone forth will not rejoice in his own strength. &gt;&gt; It will not try to make people to praise him or worship him. No, we must look for that lamin nature which is the nature of Christ. &gt;&gt; So what I said at that time was that uh uh because the anointing we will get there I don't want to run ahead of myself but this lion anointing was the anointing that ruled in the first three church ages. That's why I'm moving my arrow on this first three block in the pyramid. This anointing was the anointing that cover the first three church ages. And uh by the grace of God, we will we will go there. We will be able to show you a little bit of that. And so uh uh so John who said they are the John represented the bride of all the ages. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He represent the bride. But John in himself in himself the time that he was with the church and all of that uh uh he was under the lion anointing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's it's from the beginning of the first church ages, the the Ephesian church ages. So all the believers that were on the first church age, the second church age, the third church age, they were all under the lion anointing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now during the time of the persecution, the dark church ages, what do you think the elder will have said? &gt;&gt; The elves has prevailed. Are we together? The other will have said the ox has prevailed because the power that was making the believers to overcome in the dark age was the ox anointing. &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He would have said the ox has prevailed. What would the angel the air echo in our day? What were the air echo? &gt;&gt; The ego. &gt;&gt; The ego has prevailed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because when we when we spoke on that, we we we we we went through the message on the wings of a snow white dome where brother Brandon was explaining to us his experience. You know, when God told him the eagle on the rock and he heard the voice, the the the the dove will lead the eagle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The dove coming to lead the eagle. How can the dove lead an eagle? &gt;&gt; It cannot go as far as the eagle can go. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But remember now the dove is a type of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the nature. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Am I confusing you? Now please I I I will want to to al you again if you have if anything create question in your mind write me write send us question. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that you are understanding and if you are not writing question it means that you did not understand what I said. Praise the Lord. Amen. If you are not writing question it means that you did not understand what I said. So you need to send me question. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because you know the thing about it then is that uh uh uh you say well I don't have question because I understand and sometime you really don't understand. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And because I mean uh uh I mean even even in in teaching principle I don't know some other brothers Hillary every one of them they were teachers. The thing there is that if you teach a class and nobody have question, you never did a good job. &gt;&gt; You never did a good job. &gt;&gt; It's just what that just what I'm saying. Maybe it coming out very funny &gt;&gt; but uh that's that's what I mean. &gt;&gt; Then you you are not doing a good job &gt;&gt; because just for you for you to just believe that you so excellent that you talking everybody understand. No, I don't think I'm excellent that way. So, please if there is any question around this subject or around any subject. &gt;&gt; Let's let's uh let's let's create the attitude of asking question. Don't just be assuming in your mind. &gt;&gt; I would I would not get mad with you to go over it again and again and again. I won't get mad with you because the reason why I'm I'm I'm doing it is that brother Brandham says how how can we overcome? We must know the devil in all of his tricks. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you don't understand the anointing where your strength is coming from, take take for example, beautiful. Take for example, look at Samson. He knew he was born on a covenant. Amen. All Samson had to do was just to shake his head and make sure his seven lot was there. &gt;&gt; No matter whether he was in the deepest sleep, &gt;&gt; all he need to do was to just make sure that his servant Lord was there. He would beat any amount of troops. Why? Because he was not trusting in his muscles. &gt;&gt; He was not trusting in his prayer life. He was not trusting in how much he was obedient to God word. He were not even obedient to God word. He went down there to the Philistine and start running after Philistine girl that is disobedient to God's word. &gt;&gt; But he knew that his strength was not in his ability. His strength was given to him at his birth &gt;&gt; and your strength is given to you at your birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So because he knew that &gt;&gt; he said, "Oh, you just tell him when the time I when I pour weed around my head and this this this, they will get me." This is a Sam the Philistines are here. He just woke up. He didn't even look for where is the door, where is the window. He just shake his head. All he had to know there is that he was under the seven lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That all he had to know. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you can know that your strength is in the word, your defense is in the word, your power comes from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what your life is trapped in, all you have to do run back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All you have to do just run back to the word. Lord, I'm sorry your word says this and I break your word. forgive me, cleanse me, deliver me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you don't know where your strength comes from, then you know what you do? You get on the on on the religious trampoline. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You get on a religious trampoline. You know that one when you are running, you going nowhere &gt;&gt; and you sweating. &gt;&gt; When you going anywhere, you ready in your garage or only basement. and you're sweating &gt;&gt; and then we get on that religious trampoline and you know we start exercising oursel seven day fight and and and you know you start trying to produce every the devil will just give you a space of time &gt;&gt; when you have exhausted your strength then he comes back again &gt;&gt; because you don't know where your defense is amen &gt;&gt; you don't know where your defense is Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So that's the reason why we trying to go around this, around this, around this, just to be able to remind ourself. Look, I'm telling you, this age is evil. &gt;&gt; There's a pressure out there. &gt;&gt; It's just like a vacuum. It can suck you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It can I I I'm telling you I mean sometimes just uh you I mean you look at something on uh on on YouTube and then and then before you realize you finish spending an hour &gt;&gt; you finish spending an hour doing nothing. &gt;&gt; You are looking everything you looking at you are mad. &gt;&gt; How can it be you mad but you stay there &gt;&gt; it's not bringing you joy. It's not bringing you money. It's not bring but it is because it's just like a vacuum. &gt;&gt; It suck you in. A habit can suck you in. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But if the devil can get you to the place where he can he can he can he can he can make you not to remember that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ. He can just keep you in a cycle of condemnation. I mean, you're just feeling condemned. You're just feeling condemned. You're just feeling condemned. And then you get to the place and you ask yourself, but what is the meaning of all of this? God don't love me. I can never change. Praise the Lord. And then you say, well, I I just going to quit. I'm going to just go going to live. And then then you go start living any any kind of a life you want to live. Then the pre the predestinated see your little faith in your heart condemning. You know you're not supposed to live like this. You know you're not supposed to do this. Oh God I'm sorry. I think I need to go back to church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As now you get back to the church then the devil come against you. All the ugly thing you do, you just want to become a hrance to this church. &gt;&gt; Preach it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then you are you caught riding a cycle now. You can't get victory anymore &gt;&gt; because we don't realize that our help come from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our help comes from the Lord. &gt;&gt; What God has provided. &gt;&gt; What God has provided. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's that's what I wanted to to to remind you a little bit &gt;&gt; tonight. The lion has prevailed. The ox did prevail in this age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The man prevailed. You you know I I will get there. I'll get it to you. I'll get there and read it to you. Brother Brandham says in the in the in the main age. He said the logical thing the logical thing for them to do was to organize. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that was that was the age you were under. &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder honor thy age all of the different names of our our denomination started. Luther came out with reformation and he pul those thesis on the on the on on on the church. He came out not with the forward but something burning in his heart to get to the forward. &gt;&gt; The joy shall live by faith but he don't have the forward. &gt;&gt; And this man is condemning everything that the church is doing. He still carrying on with a pipe &gt;&gt; in his mouth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He does not have the full word, but God is using him because he was under this anointing right there. Zwingling comes out and says uh uh uh uh uh what what Lu is saying is is is is right, but he's compromising. He stayed he stayed uh in in contact with the king. If we are the church, let's cut away from the church. We we don't have no I mean let's cut away from the state. We don't have nothing to do with the state. We will not salute. We will not sing the national anthem. That's why you get your your your uh uh Jehovah Witness don't want to salute and and and you know Latterday Saints. You get all of these things. Every naming denomination came from under this. The logical thing to do was to organize. Praise the Lord. Amen. As as uh as uh as as as the reformation came in, you know, the blessing was coming. The people were gradually returning back to the to the true baptism, it it started become becoming a struggle because Catholic has has has introduced sprinkling to the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sprinkling to the people. And as the church started getting back to baptism by immersion in the time of the reformation, it was called the Anabaptist. That's where the Baptist church came from. The Baptist church separated because at that time they were promoting immersion even though they were doing it in father, son, and the holy ghost. But they could go back to the word and say that word baptism means to be immersed. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Man of Simon, he was a priest. He he listened a little bit to what uh Luther was saying. He said it's truth. I you know I can't be like Zwingley. I'm not going to be radical. I'm not going to be like like uh Luther. So he formed what is called the the the the how do you call it? Menonites. That's how the Menanites was born from man of Simon. So you see all of these men, they were going back to the to the anointing. There is an anointing that was influencing them to come out of the church, come out of the church. But whenever they come, they organize with an idea and it became a denomination. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. West came on the scene, the move up there, the uh uh uh the Nazareth said, "Well, I mean uh uh we believe in sanctification, but uh how can we say we are sanctified?" And and I mean, we still wearing rings on our hands and and earrings and and uh so the Nazareth took it a little bit further. &gt;&gt; But every time they were move, they would take an idea and organize with it. Praise the Lord. Instead of moving on and moving on and wanting more of God, they just take something and organize with it. Now we, you know, we can we we we we we can wear rings and and and and you know, and all of those things now. I mean, that's it. We are sanctified. Nothing of the word. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in that age the other will have said the man has prevailed which mean God is raising up men. God is now raising up men that are going to challenge and and and and it was right in this age that uh uh uh uh the the printing press was built. Right in the same age the Bible was printed. Now God has anointed using man mechanism. He's now giving man wisdom mechanism to publish so this thing can move faster. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know you know under the H power this was the airplane. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Right in this time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, right in this time both the I mean all all of all of the all all of the inventions of God and everything came right in this time right in this period of time. So let's uh may our so are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lion has prevailed. The lion has prevailed. now saying the lion the lion of the trap of Judah the lion you know of the trap of Judah is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know that all all these anointing is Christ. &gt;&gt; They overcame by what? The blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Now uh uh you what what you have to understand here is that uh uh uh uh God is showing all of these things to John in the symbol. You see because if you understand the lion has prevailed and John turned around and saw a lamb then you will understand Revelation chapter 6 when the lion said come and see. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I went back there because when we get back to Revelation chapter 6 and one of the the the the the beast said come and see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now then you will be able to understand what is happening there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in in in Revelation 6:1, the lamb had the open book. The book was open where in Revelation chapter 5. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't if you don't look at it wisely, you will think they are different different periods of time. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that's what I'm trying to to be able to bring to us tonight so we can be able to see it. And one of the elders said unto John, "Weep now behold the lion of the tribe of of Judah, the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof." But when John turned, he saw a lamb. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he turned, he saw a lamb that was bleeding. Praise the Lord. He saw a lamb and I behold and I beheld and look in the midst of the throne and in of the four beasts and in the midst of the others to a lamb as it has been slain having seven halms and seven eyes which are the spirit seven spirit of God that is sent throughout all the earth. I would like to look at that too but tonight I just want to dwell on this. So uh now we can we can get to Revelation chapter 6 quickly. Let me just let me just uh uh look at something in Revelation chapter 6. So our image will stay out there. If you have your Bible just look in your Bible. Revelation chapter 6 now comes on the scene and it says here to us and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal. Praise the Lord. And I heard as as it were a noise of thunder and one of the four beasts, one of these saying, "Come and see." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come and see." The lamb is holding the book. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb is holding the open book. This beast is calling to the elect of the age. Amen. &gt;&gt; This anointing is calling to the elect of the age. Every time Paul preached when he when he was there before he left the disciples, he says, "I'm not ashamed to declare the entire council of God to you after my depart departure there. There are graving wolves that will come among you." Amen. As he was under that anointing speaking, he was showing the working of &gt;&gt; of this evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So he said, "Come and see." And and and and John is there. Is he not John is about to tell us what he saw? what what the beast show him. I saw and and behold a white house and and he that sat on him had a bold and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He had a board. He had a board. Let me do something for you quickly with a few minutes that is left. With a few with the the few minutes that is left. Uh Revelation chapter 2. Let's go to Revelation chapter 2. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation chapter 2. I have a page that is stick together here. Now, Revelation chapter 2 reads unto the angel of the church in Ephesus. Right? Now, you have to know Epheso is under the look. Epheso is under this is under this is is right here. This is the Ephesian church age. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I just want to show you something. Go back to the to the reading there. Thank you. You can flip them. I appreciate it. This thing said he that holdeth the seven stars in his in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden count. I know thy works. I know that labor that patient and how thou cannot bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and have born and and and have uh patience and for my name's sake has labored and have not fainted. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou has left that first love. Now you see how go back to the image. Thou has left your first love. Now you see that that innocent thing is represented in the whiteness is coming in innocently. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will tell us in the church age it was in an unguarded moment. When they were not paying attention &gt;&gt; slowly they start falling away from those things that were very precious to them. those things that could they could not allow they could not tolerate they start falling away from it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that slowly the enemy is creeping in. So you see here in Revelation chapter 6 you only see uh a white horse and a rather but in Revelation chapter two when you reading the church age that's when now you see the rather taking place. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so and uh uh you left your first law. Remember wherefore thou uh were where uh remember therefore from whence thou are falling and repent and do thy first workh or else I come quickly and remove that candlestick. Verse six. But this thou has that thou hated the days of the nickelian &gt;&gt; which I also hate. So what is happening here is that the nickelian started the nickelian spirit started and and what was that spirit? What was it? &gt;&gt; Conquering. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the white horse went to what? Conquer. So here is a spirit now that has rised up in the church that is now conquering the people slowly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are not falling in obedience to the word anymore. They don't the word do not move them but there is a man that can control them. When a man yel, they shakes. But when they point to they look at the word, the word do not move them again. Why? Because they are falling away from their first love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see what what I want to show you is that in Revelation chapter 6, the Bible says he went to conquer. He had a bow and what? A crown. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham will show us that uh this spirit started with the this of the nickelen it move on to the next what in the next age it became something something that was innocent &gt;&gt; and before it get to the third age it got crown &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that's the crown that was given him &gt;&gt; the crown was given him in the third age &gt;&gt; the spirit got crowned among the people. &gt;&gt; Baptism, baptizing in father, son, and holy ghost was crowned among the people. &gt;&gt; It started very innocent, but it got a crown. &gt;&gt; It never had a bowl, so it did not hurt the people. It was innocent. &gt;&gt; No, we must not do this. You know, while they are special people, we must respect and and they just take the the the presence of God away from the people. The fear of the word was gone away from the people. Now men were established in the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the third church age then that spirit that doctrine became crown. That's that just what I just I just wanted to give you a little insight on it. But but that's where we are going with this. So there will be a lot of going back and forth. You can see you will see be able to see the the uh what did I put this? You will see the representation here. You will see the representation here. But then when you go back to the church ages then now you will start understanding what was really happening. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So we will get there what was really happening. So yeah th that has you hate the deeds of the nickel and we shall hate verse seven. He that have an ear let him hear what the spirit what this is saying to the church. He that have an ear listen to your anointing listen to the voice of your age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lion is rolling. Listen to the lion. Don't look at the dust that is going in the air from this thing. &gt;&gt; He that have an ear, let him hear what the spirit says unto the church because to him that overcome. Praise the Lord. To him that prevail. The only way you will prevail is to listen to the voice &gt;&gt; of your anointing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; To him that overcome. The only way you will overcome. You cannot overcome if you are not listening to the voice of your messenger. You are not listening to the voice that is sent to help you overcome. Are we together &gt;&gt; now? So you see that's the reason why he told us rapturing faith is on those tapes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is something on those steps to uh to increase your faith. Something on the tape to quicken the word to you. &gt;&gt; Because when you hear what God did in that day, you can also believe it for your day. &gt;&gt; Are we together? It says we read our Bible and we pray every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that overcoming power is in the voice. He that have an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the church. Because to him that overcome in another way you can say he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church because this is the way you will overcome. &gt;&gt; You don't have no other way to overcome the the the the spirit of your age. You don't have no other way to overcome until you hear what the spirit says. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Little by little, the Lord will make it clearer for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will make it clearer for us. But I wanted to bring it to you tonight so we you can see uh the influence that we are on. You can see the thing that make us overcome is listening to the voice of our messenger. &gt;&gt; Listening to the voice of God speaking in our bay. that have an ear listening to what the spirit say. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listening to what the spirit say. The Lord bless you. Musicians, you can come and uh uh we pray that the Lord will be able to to help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Automatic God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. We be made overcomers. Let's just sing that a little bit tonight before we pray. Let's just use that and allow the word to settle down. [Music] Overcomers in this house. We be made victorious [Music] through the blood of Jesus Christ. [Music] Oh, we be made whole and darker. [Music] overcomeing this life. [Music] We be victorious [Music] through the blood of Jesus Christ. [Music] Oh, we be made more than conquerors. Overcomer in this hour, in this life.

We be made victorious is what he has provided through the blood of Jesus Christ. Oh hallelujah Lord. Oh, we be made more than conquerors. Overcome in this time. Oh yes. Oh Lord, we be made victorious [Music] through the blood of Jesus Christ. You know why you are more than conquerors? The reason why you are more than conquerors is because he conquer. He said in in uh in in John, be of a good cheer because I have overcome this word. He overcome and then he laid the victory in your laps. If you can just believe his word and believe what he has done for you, he overcome and he put the victory in your life. He says step into victory, live in victory, believe in victory, walk in victory. [Music] Father, we just want to thank you tonight, Lord. We want to thank you, precious Lord. Father, oh God, I just I'm praying, Lord, that Father, you'd be able to bring this thing out, Lord. Bring it out, Lord Jesus.

Father, oh precious Lord, Father, we will now begin to Lord appreciate the message, Lord. We will go back, Lord, Father, to studying the word. We will go back to listening to the word. We will go back to reading the scripture, Lord, because we know that's where our strength comes from, Lord. We will not be making up things in our mind, oh God. Father, oh Jesus, we will not be make making up things in our mind. We will not be guessing, Lord Jesus.

And uh we still looking forward to see if we will have our our talk with the church on Sunday. I mean it's it's a service. It's not just for for you know just just you know our members. All I want to avoid is that I don't want you know I don't want u uh you know internet because the thing about it there is that one thing I I I realized with the internet thing is that the judges are on the internet. Amen. The judges are on the internet. You know they don't know nothing that you're dealing with. They just hear one thing and then they round up their judgment. So I want to keep the judges out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to keep the judges out. So I I I spoke to brother Jordan to see if he can create a kind of a personal channel for us. So if if anybody will not be in service on Sunday, just let us know, send me a text. If we get a personal link, we will send it to you and uh uh uh then you can be able to follow the service while you are not in service because I was thinking about it. It would not be justice to those that uh would love to be here. They can't be here with us and and then they can't follow online. I just want to keep the judges out. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you can, if you can appreciate us, don't judge us. Don't condemn us. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's sing that song. [Music] We are dismissed. United Jesus Christ the landing on my [Music] we got you in Jesus Christ [Music] and Francis [Music] [Laughter] [Music] for we are united in Jesus Christ. We are the soldiers of the life. We don't rise of flesh and blood. But politics are done that we do our magic. Don't be crushing the enemy. Honor our faith. We are mighty in our standing. Oh yet we are united in Jesus Christ. We are the soldier of the might. We don't rise.
