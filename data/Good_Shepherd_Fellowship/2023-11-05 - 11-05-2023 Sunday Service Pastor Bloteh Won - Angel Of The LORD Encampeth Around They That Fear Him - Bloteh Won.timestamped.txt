[39:05] blessings and uh we have a uh few
[39:10] announcement here we would like to to
[39:14] cover
[39:17] uh oh I was going to forget uh I think
[39:20] we have a we have a song that we were
[39:23] supposed to do on Wednesday night sorry
[39:26] for the service on Wednesday night if
[39:28] you whether you notice or not but uh I
[39:31] kind of for room my inspiration on
[39:33] Wednesday night I was I was so fired up
[39:37] to speak on what I wanted to speak on
[39:39] that I entitled The superstitious
[39:42] gospel but then uh just before uh left
[39:47] the office uh uh my wife and the
[39:50] children were coming from redeem uh uh
[39:55] conference and at school and then uh uh
[39:59] the alternator on her car went off so
[40:02] she called me just when I was about to
[40:05] come from in the office so you know
[40:07] where my heart
[40:08] was praise the Lord and you see
[40:12] uh
[40:14] uh I mean that's that's the way it is
[40:16] you fall out of that channel to get back
[40:19] into it becomes difficult you know
[40:22] that's the reason why most of the time
[40:23] we don't like too much talking before we
[40:25] come up here because the moment you fall
[40:27] out of that channel to get back becomes
[40:30] very very difficult so I was preaching
[40:32] to you but I was struggling in my mind I
[40:34] was thinking know has Triple A got there
[40:37] yet and I wonder what is going on what
[40:40] part of the road is she parking you know
[40:43] all of that so I kind of foru my
[40:46] inspiration so we were we were supposed
[40:48] to do that song on Wednesday night I
[40:50] told Brother Ariel but then the girls
[40:52] were not able to come so uh they
[40:55] reminded me so we have a a song that we
[40:58] would like to do and uh and and the
[41:01] reason behind that song is uh uh uh some
[41:06] of the things I was going to talk about
[41:08] so I pray that you and redeem you can
[41:10] come up let's uh let's
[41:16] uh and uh I throw the words uh also
[41:22] there so we have
[41:24] uh uh
[41:27] we should have the
[41:28] words of the brother a you remember the
[41:34] song

[47:29] that's good that's good
[47:32] beautiful beautiful thank you thank you
[47:35] thank you praise the
[47:38] Lord amen praise the
[47:42] Lord amen that last answerer that last
[47:47] answerer I wrote it and I wrote it
[47:50] because uh because of everything that
[47:53] was going through my mind and and
[47:57] uh and that's where I was going to come
[47:59] from with that whole thought of a
[48:01] superstitious
[48:03] gospel and it's it's it became
[48:06] superstitious over the years because of
[48:10] what uh uh you know people believe the
[48:14] things that uh uh that when you when you
[48:20] uh read the the chorus I rather be in
[48:23] the in a deep di grave
[48:27] but the grave is not our
[48:30] home praise the Lord the grave is only
[48:34] the Earth returning back to the
[48:37] Earth praise the Lord amen it's it's on
[48:42] it that you you see that is the reason
[48:45] why uh all of the people and big part of
[48:50] those things was push on us from the
[48:52] Catholic church this worship of the Dead
[48:56] right this worship of death the worship
[48:59] of dead and and you know and all of the
[49:01] things that we tried you know uh people
[49:04] try to put to death and all of that is
[49:08] because even though it's been R from the
[49:11] scripture but uh uh uh the the
[49:15] understanding the experience the
[49:16] Revelation has never come to the heart
[49:19] of man praise the Lord and and and you
[49:22] will see and and realize that's the
[49:24] reason why why uh uh uh brother Brandon
[49:28] visit behind the curtain of the time God
[49:31] allowed that to be able to break the
[49:35] seal that was upon what happened when we
[49:39] leave from
[49:42] here those that stay and be changed in
[49:45] the twinkling of an
[49:49] eye is not better than them that
[49:53] die praise the Lord is the same
[49:57] experience if I should drop there right

[50:31] what it is when you are walking on the
[50:33] street and your body
[50:38] change are we together praise the Lord
[50:41] so you see that th those that's where my
[50:43] mind was you know because I mean there
[50:45] is just a bunch of uh uh uh superstitial
[50:49] things that uh that has hang around the
[50:53] church you know hang around the church
[50:55] and and all of that that's that's what I
[50:58] was bringing from the place of Rachel
[51:00] stealing her father Idol because all of
[51:02] those things were sto from the Catholic
[51:04] church and it were brought right into
[51:06] the church and and and people you know
[51:09] are just believing those things you know
[51:11] what and and and and I mean they just
[51:14] plague our
[51:15] minds you know someone asked me some
[51:18] time ago they you know they wanted me to
[51:22] give them anointing
[51:24] oil I thought in my mind I mean
[51:29] uh you go back to the to the people that
[51:32] was giving those ordin it was only the
[51:35] priest that handled anointing
[51:38] oil praise the Lord but what have it
[51:41] become today in in uh in in in in cyc
[51:44] churches they think that is something to
[51:47] cast out evil
[51:48] spirits you know so people get anointing
[51:51] oil in their house you know they sprink
[51:52] it up they sprink it all over the place
[51:55] they sprink it all over the place some
[51:57] of them get holy water they sprink it
[51:59] all over those are just bunch of
[52:05] superstitious praise the
[52:07] Lord and we think that is uh is uh is uh
[52:11] you know uh uh uh those are some of the
[52:14] things we'll talk about this morning but
[52:16] I'm going in a different direction I
[52:18] Roan inspiration on on on Wednesday I
[52:21] have to go back again and then the Holy
[52:23] Ghost cook it up for me amen so I'm
[52:25] going to go in a different direction but
[52:28] uh but that's okay you know because uh
[52:32] uh uh and and and what I want to talk
[52:34] about this morning is the the angel of
[52:37] the Lord I come about those that fear
[52:41] Him amen and also the the encamping of
[52:44] angels you talk about the angel of the
[52:47] Lord you talk about the seven angels you
[52:49] talk about the angel that brought the
[52:51] commission all of those things also turn
[52:54] to be believe as superstitious people
[52:57] think it's superstitious belief that we
[53:01] have when we talk about
[53:02] angels but we want to look at those
[53:04] things in the word this morning well

[1:00:02] that he would he wouldn't have requested
[1:00:04] so let's come in and uh be part of the
[1:00:07] service Wednesday night and then uh uh
[1:00:12] another thing I would like to address
[1:00:14] before uh um going into my message this
[1:00:19] morning and uh uh if if you do remember
[1:00:26] um Paul in the book of Corinthian uh uh
[1:00:30] bam called there the Church of
[1:00:32] Correction Paul there in First
[1:00:35] Corinthian with lot of the problems that
[1:00:38] the people the Church of Corinthian was
[1:00:40] having Paul uh in dealing with the
[1:00:43] people there there was a situation that
[1:00:46] came up and that situation was uh uh a
[1:00:51] man in the Corinthian Church you have to
[1:00:53] remember now those people people they
[1:00:55] came out of lot of you know uh uh
[1:00:59] strange beliefs lot of uh things they
[1:01:01] came out of to come to
[1:01:04] Christianity and uh so this
[1:01:06] man uh was uh uh for some reason he was
[1:01:11] living with his father's
[1:01:13] wife and then when they told Paul uh uh
[1:01:17] he realized that there was not a conduct
[1:01:20] that the church was going to to you know
[1:01:25] encourage so Paul wrote them a letter
[1:01:27] and says you know we're not going to
[1:01:30] bring this kind of a behavior in the
[1:01:31] church uh uh so uh uh you know the man
[1:01:36] must be advised if he continue to live
[1:01:38] that way then Paul says ask communicate
[1:01:40] him you
[1:01:41] know cast him out you know uh uh so so
[1:01:46] we of course if you follow the book of
[1:01:48] First Corinthian that was where Paul you
[1:01:51] know talk about uh uh excommunication
[1:01:55] but then his second letter to the Church
[1:01:58] of uh
[1:01:59] Corinthians uh uh the man have corrected
[1:02:03] what was
[1:02:04] wrong and Paul was told so Paul had to
[1:02:08] write the people you know because you
[1:02:10] see the thing that is not is not a
[1:02:12] battle against flesh and
[1:02:15] blood what it is is that uh we have a
[1:02:18] standard which is the word of God we try
[1:02:21] to uphold the word of God when you walk
[1:02:24] walk through those doors and come in
[1:02:26] this building all you're trying to do is
[1:02:29] help us to lift this word of God up and
[1:02:32] we want to lift it up above our
[1:02:36] heads the word must be lifted above
[1:02:39] every one of
[1:02:42] us praise the Lord that's that's what we
[1:02:46] are here
[1:02:48] doing that's all we here doing
[1:02:50] encouraging one another let's lift this
[1:02:52] word up let Jesus be glorified let
[1:02:56] people see that uh the redeem is on the
[1:03:02] earth so it's it's not it's not a flesh
[1:03:05] and blood thing and one person attacking
[1:03:07] another person and and all of that so
[1:03:10] Paul then wrote the brothers and says
[1:03:12] well if the man has corrected himself
[1:03:15] you don't leave him out
[1:03:17] there we only took that position against
[1:03:20] him because it was not the word of God
[1:03:23] and I'm telling you that is still the
[1:03:25] word of God sir if a man live contrary
[1:03:28] to what we believe here we will
[1:03:30] excommunicate
[1:03:33] you numbers is not our
[1:03:36] problem you know why numbers is not our
[1:03:39] problem because we got we having more
[1:03:41] numbers than you
[1:03:44] see praise the lord we having more
[1:03:47] numbers than you see this morning
[1:03:51] because we are in cabout by Angel
[1:03:57] praise the
[1:03:58] Lord so we have a word of God that we
[1:04:01] want to
[1:04:02] uphold and may God give us Grace not
[1:04:06] even
[1:04:07] myself is above the
[1:04:09] word you know so Paul told told why why
[1:04:13] why that I mean if the man has corrected
[1:04:15] his ways you're encourag him back to
[1:04:17] church all we wanted to do we just
[1:04:19] wanted to in correct there that that is
[1:04:22] not our way of life right
[1:04:25] praise the Lord you know some of you
[1:04:27] will remember I think uh that will be
[1:04:29] sometime last year and uh uh uh we we
[1:04:38] uh during one of our service we had to
[1:04:41] we had to uh uh uh correct some things
[1:04:45] brother uh I think brother Johnny has
[1:04:48] just returned back from his trip and
[1:04:50] we've uh uh you know some of the things
[1:04:53] that were that were there on Facebook
[1:04:56] and uh because uh uh brother
[1:04:59] Johnny uh and his wife sister Masa I've
[1:05:03] been friends with them now for some
[1:05:05] years I remember one time they came to
[1:05:07] visit uh sister Masa relatives and they
[1:05:10] got a hold of me even before they came
[1:05:12] to visit I can rightly remember that was
[1:05:15] I think brother Valentine I gave them my
[1:05:17] number and uh because uh uh Masa wanted
[1:05:21] to know if uh you know if the m was in
[1:05:25] Liberia and all of that so that's how I
[1:05:28] got in contact with them so I've been
[1:05:29] friends with them uh uh uh you know even
[1:05:33] before the move year but then when the
[1:05:35] move year we got close and and and like
[1:05:39] every family has problems and issues
[1:05:42] there were things that they were dealing
[1:05:43] with so in the midst of that uh I think
[1:05:47] uh uh you know uh by their choice and uh
[1:05:52] after we we did all that we could to
[1:05:56] talk to them and encourage them you know
[1:05:59] by their choice they were
[1:06:01] separated and then in that in that time
[1:06:04] of Separation there were other things
[1:06:06] that were going on and uh uh uh more
[1:06:10] especially you know for for brother
[1:06:13] Johnny because he was here with us in
[1:06:15] church and uh uh sister Masa was now
[1:06:19] with us in church you know so uh uh uh
[1:06:24] we we could only apply the standard of
[1:06:27] the word that we had to brother Johnny
[1:06:29] because he was here with us in church
[1:06:31] you know so when some of those things
[1:06:33] came up when I heard about it and uh uh
[1:06:37] he and myself we talk and I told him
[1:06:41] because this thing is a public thing I
[1:06:43] believe many in the church might have
[1:06:45] seen things on the internet I'm going to
[1:06:48] address it from the back of the pulpit
[1:06:50] you know it's not I'm not attacking you
[1:06:53] I'm just just only going to defend what
[1:06:56] we stand
[1:06:57] for so uh uh that was done and then uh
[1:07:02] uh uh couple of months the months went
[1:07:06] back and I'm I'm also I'm also grateful
[1:07:11] that uh uh in as in as much as uh you
[1:07:16] know with with every one of us we have
[1:07:18] our ego we have uh you know places where
[1:07:22] we can be uncomfortable table and all of
[1:07:25] that but uh uh I think uh our brother
[1:07:29] was able to see where I was coming from
[1:07:32] and uh you know uh uh and then he he he
[1:07:36] hang in there and and all of that
[1:07:41] until uh then couple of months uh
[1:07:46] uh his wife reached out to me she wanted
[1:07:49] to talk to me and uh uh and she knew I
[1:07:53] was mad mad she knew that I was mad I
[1:07:56] was just trying to hold
[1:07:58] myself I said Lord just help me and I
[1:08:01] shouldn't missbehave Lord please help me
[1:08:06] I shouldn't misbehave let it not be me
[1:08:09] let me not take this thing personer let
[1:08:11] it not be me but she reached out to me
[1:08:15] and we
[1:08:16] talk and uh and uh but as the Lord will
[1:08:20] have it they decided to reconcile their
[1:08:25] differences and uh uh and go back and
[1:08:29] clean up some of the mess that it
[1:08:31] created for
[1:08:32] themsel and uh uh uh and then uh they
[1:08:38] they rejoined thems uh by going uh back
[1:08:42] to the court of Lord and and uh randing
[1:08:46] the uh the their
[1:08:48] marriage so uh uh I thought that okay
[1:08:52] since uh we spoke to our brother
[1:08:55] publicly from the back of this Pulpit we
[1:08:56] are just only using Apostolic style and
[1:09:00] uh it will be good for us to to come
[1:09:03] back to this local assembly and say to
[1:09:06] the best of my knowledge that I know uh
[1:09:09] brother Johnny and sister mastera have
[1:09:13] uh reunited himself to be husband and
[1:09:15] wife praise the Lord so can you both
[1:09:18] just stand in your

[1:19:16] but what we want to talk about this

[1:19:21] Lord encamped the encamping of the
[1:19:25] angels of the Lord amen let me start up

[1:19:48] another like this just like we are doing
[1:19:50] you're looking at me I'm looking at you
[1:19:52] we become SOC conscious but there's
[1:19:55] there's a unseen
[1:19:58] word and uh you is greater than

[1:20:05] this word in this building year right
[1:20:08] here this morning are evil spirits and
[1:20:12] Wars praise the Lord right here this
[1:20:15] morning as we are sitting down here uh
[1:20:18] we we are dealing with all of those
[1:20:20] things I mean if if there is something
[1:20:22] coming through your mind that uh you
[1:20:24] know you think it's not the right thing
[1:20:26] to think why am I thinking about this
[1:20:28] that's what he's talking about those are
[1:20:30] all evil spirits in war you know we deal
[1:20:33] with all of those
[1:20:34] things right here in the
[1:20:37] building yeah are evil spirits in world
[1:20:40] and and and uh Christians anointed you
[1:20:44] know uh uh and the angers of God
[1:20:48] encamped about them trying to energize
[1:20:53] them with
[1:20:54] faith praise the Lord amen while we are
[1:20:58] dealing with all of those things and uh
[1:21:01] the the encamping of the
[1:21:03] Angels uh uh uh they they are trying to
[1:21:07] energize us you know they're trying to
[1:21:10] to to to uh uh affect our spirit with
[1:21:13] positive things you know when you read
[1:21:16] the word maybe something in the
[1:21:17] scripture will cut catch your mind or
[1:21:20] something in the coat will catch your
[1:21:22] mind or of those things they they try to
[1:21:24] in use there to influence us by to
[1:21:27] energize our
[1:21:29] faith and yeah and yeah I am standing
[1:21:33] here just yielding myself and the Holy
[1:21:37] Spirit and moving and this is what you
[1:21:40] call Heavenly places in Christ
[1:21:43] Jesus amen the the the the the moving of
[1:21:48] the holy spirit being being affected by
[1:21:51] the by the bumping of angels and then
[1:21:54] trying to lift our mind on uh so no
[1:21:57] matter what we are dealing with uh we
[1:21:59] can we you know we can we can come up
[1:22:02] with a hope and you know and some
[1:22:04] courage that God is in control that God
[1:22:07] is able to deliver us that God can bring
[1:22:09] us through amen from that scripture that
[1:22:11] I just read I think God can bring or
[1:22:13] from that song I just listened to or
[1:22:16] from that testimony I believe that God
[1:22:18] is in control and all of those things
[1:22:21] are are the encamping of Angels trying
[1:22:23] to energize our faith amen trying to
[1:22:27] give us hope and courage from the
[1:22:33] word but remember Satan always he's
[1:22:37] always are the sons of God you know he
[1:22:40] always does
[1:22:42] that someone with a skeptic
[1:22:45] Spirit when they do that just he trying
[1:22:50] to interfere so what I say what is he
[1:22:53] saying you know the the enemy will not
[1:22:55] allow us he will just not allow us to
[1:22:58] enjoy this blessing of heavenly places
[1:23:01] praise the Lord he might you know were
[1:23:04] braking some kind of skp or unbelief and
[1:23:08] uh you know and people will have
[1:23:09] questions please if I preach you have
[1:23:11] questions you're free to ask me you know
[1:23:14] yeah you just free to ask me if you
[1:23:16] don't understand anything I said you're
[1:23:18] free to ask me you can wait after the
[1:23:20] service if not pick my number as the
[1:23:22] deacons they will give it to you there
[1:23:24] is no you know there is no fee you need
[1:23:27] to pay to come and see me praise the
[1:23:29] Lord I don't have no waiting
[1:23:32] list amen if you can come I can drive to
[1:23:35] meet you so praise the
[1:23:39] Lord so yeah but he would not he would
[1:23:41] not allow us you know to to enjoy all of
[1:23:45] that he will always hm really you know
[1:23:49] he I mean he just have a way of uh you
[1:23:52] know know we're playing with our
[1:23:53] thoughts you know and and and uh uh all
[1:23:56] because he want to interfere praise the
[1:24:00] Lord now so uh uh uh uh and that is the
[1:24:05] reason why I believe that when we are
[1:24:10] not prayed up or when we don't come on
[1:24:13] time to pray you know when we don't use
[1:24:16] the prayer time come you come early you
[1:24:19] you you have uh uh a TI place and so all
[1:24:23] of those things is to help prepare our
[1:24:25] mind because you are listening to
[1:24:26] Something in the word you know you've
[1:24:28] been corrected by the word and something
[1:24:30] leaves on your mind it all helps to
[1:24:33] settle your spirit down because whether
[1:24:36] you are filled with the Holy Ghost or
[1:24:39] net you still have the possibility to
[1:24:41] pack an evil
[1:24:44] spirit whether you believe it or
[1:24:48] that praise the Lord yes you have the
[1:24:51] possibility to park an evil spirit it
[1:24:54] can it's it's as
[1:24:56] simple as just arguing while you are
[1:24:59] driving just as simple as there let me
[1:25:02] not bring no bad
[1:25:05] dreams just no I mean no you can't hear
[1:25:08] me no I say
[1:25:12] no and you finish putting out some
[1:25:15] energy you're all your emotions inside
[1:25:17] and and you are all is your mind is all
[1:25:20] caught up in death why can't you
[1:25:22] understand me I keep explaining this
[1:25:24] thing to you and you know and and all of
[1:25:28] that and then when you come right into
[1:25:32] service you are bothered by that it
[1:25:35] keeps playing on your mind praise the
[1:25:38] Lord you have just packed an evil spirit
[1:25:40] in the
[1:25:42] church as simple as that you have just
[1:25:45] packed an evil spirit in the church you
[1:25:48] are sitting there the people are saying
[1:25:49] praise God hallelujah you I de or you
[1:25:52] when we get home get home we'll have to
[1:25:55] solve this
[1:25:56] problem I'm tired with
[1:26:00] that blessed be the name of the Lord you
[1:26:03] are
[1:26:05] just blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:26:07] your mind is seeing let's let's just get
[1:26:14] home praise the Lord it is just as easy
[1:26:18] it's just as simple as that just as
[1:26:21] simple as that
[1:26:22] praise the Lord you see and and and we
[1:26:25] have become so spiritual that we don't
[1:26:28] we when we come into church we don't
[1:26:31] even take a time to
[1:26:32] pray we don't even bow our heart down
[1:26:35] and say Lord I've come among your people
[1:26:38] please help
[1:26:39] me I'm not able to make it yet on time
[1:26:42] or Lord I'm yet and just clear my mind
[1:26:44] and father help me let me we don't we we
[1:26:47] so spiritual we are above that we must
[1:26:51] just step in we are we we we having
[1:26:54] Angelic escort into the presence of
[1:26:58] God praise the Lord and many times when
[1:27:01] the service is is not a blessing it's
[1:27:04] your own fault that's right it's your
[1:27:07] own
[1:27:10] fa because if you came from your house
[1:27:12] to hear from God and you came with a
[1:27:15] ready mind something will be said that
[1:27:19] will be a blessing to
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:24] praise the
[1:27:41] Lord I love this one also from the
[1:27:44] fourth seal trying to find my my place
[1:27:48] to Stand Here notice if you are an
[1:27:52] ambassador from Heaven All Heavens
[1:27:56] behind
[1:27:57] you if you are an ambassad from Heaven
[1:28:01] All Heaven behind
[1:28:05] you and
[1:28:08] Heaven is consist of the
[1:28:12] word this is Heavenly
[1:28:17] places this is Heavenly
[1:28:20] places right is the atmosphere is the
[1:28:24] word the atmosphere that the word
[1:28:29] create Heaven is consist of the
[1:28:36] word praise the Lord how Jesus said it
[1:28:40] Heaven and Earth will pass away my word
[1:28:43] will not
[1:28:45] right are we
[1:28:48] together now so that is what I want want
[1:28:52] us to be able to labor with praise the
[1:28:55] Lord that's what I want us to be able to
[1:28:58] labor with and uh uh let me let me step
[1:29:02] out here I know I'm I'm I'm out of time
[1:29:06] but uh uh many many has been uh sharing
[1:29:10] concern I I told Brother Jordan he was
[1:29:12] going to explain some of these things to
[1:29:15] us but I forget uh uh I know you it's
[1:29:19] it's kind of a strange it's it's winter
[1:29:21] time this building should be hot why are
[1:29:22] you feeling cold I know that has been
[1:29:25] the concern you I hear that I see that
[1:29:29] and uh but what actually is happening
[1:29:31] here is that after the the system was
[1:29:34] repaired the uh the uh the brothers set
[1:29:38] the system to the place where uh uh the
[1:29:44] the the system runs inia on cold but it
[1:29:48] is set up to about
[1:29:50] 74°
[1:29:53] and then out there it runs on heat
[1:29:56] because the building is so
[1:29:58] small and uh uh and and you know and we
[1:30:03] we uh when we come in our numbers we we
[1:30:06] fill this place
[1:30:08] so it's running on
[1:30:12] automatic so when you feel that cold
[1:30:15] breeze the system has just turned on and
[1:30:19] is pouring out there but after the while
[1:30:21] it will shut off and then our body
[1:30:24] temperature will rise it up
[1:30:28] again because if they should turn it on
[1:30:33] heat in no time we will start feeling
[1:30:38] uncomfortable praise the
[1:30:40] Lord and most especially for
[1:30:45] me you know I I have dry skin so my
[1:30:48] whole body start ising and then you
[1:30:51] think that I'm I'm I'm on
[1:30:53] fire I'm not on fire because I'm I'm
[1:30:55] inspired I'm on fire because my body is
[1:30:58] on fired you know so that's that was
[1:31:00] what they they explained so uh uh I I
[1:31:04] thought that I will have brother Jordan
[1:31:06] come and bring you a more a more decent
[1:31:09] uh uh but we keep Ming there we keep
[1:31:11] missing there so I just thought that
[1:31:13] I'll do my best to to explain that to
[1:31:16] you so maybe sometime we will getting up
[1:31:18] to do that now so let me get back to my
[1:31:21] thoughts so what we want to do here this
[1:31:23] morning in talking about the angels of
[1:31:25] the Lord and come about them that fear
[1:31:28] him I want us to to to travel in a way
[1:31:31] to be able to understand what I want us
[1:31:34] to establish is that when you go back I
[1:31:38] mean there there's a whole lot I get a
[1:31:40] bunch of quotes here I can use to preach
[1:31:42] the rest of the year and uh but when you
[1:31:45] go back you will realize that uh uh uh
[1:31:50] Angels were
[1:31:52] uh the the the first being to be created
[1:31:56] after
[1:31:57] God you know uh uh condens himself in
[1:32:01] the body of the logos for God to be God
[1:32:04] he was the self-existing one for him to
[1:32:07] be God God means an object of worship so
[1:32:12] he had to make
[1:32:14] Angels so when the Angels started
[1:32:17] worshiping him then they they bring to
[1:32:21] pass that that manifested his attribute
[1:32:23] of being
[1:32:25] God praise the Lord but this is where I
[1:32:28] want for us to to to to be able to
[1:32:31] Fellowship around this
[1:32:34] morning God you you read in the book of
[1:32:37] coluan the Bible say he created all
[1:32:40] things
[1:32:42] amen and there Paul express it in such a
[1:32:46] way that he created All Things by Jesus
[1:32:49] Christ it was not it was not the the
[1:32:51] body it was not the physical body of
[1:32:54] Jesus Christ but it was God in in in the
[1:32:58] in the in the tonic body in the logos
[1:33:01] body a body of
[1:33:03] light that was the first form that God
[1:33:07] took in the beginning when the Bible
[1:33:10] says there in the book of uh of of uh uh
[1:33:13] Revelation the beginning of the creation
[1:33:16] of God so God creating himself he was
[1:33:22] the great internal
[1:33:26] spirit and there was no time it was just
[1:33:30] internity so for time to begin God has
[1:33:34] to leave that form of being the internal
[1:33:37] spirit and be he had to take a form so
[1:33:41] the form that he took is what uh uh uh
[1:33:45] the theologians called the logos it's a
[1:33:47] body of light in the beginning was the
[1:33:50] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:33:52] God and the Bible says that uh you know
[1:33:55] he uh he's the light of the world so
[1:33:57] that light he took so when it was that
[1:34:00] light now that body of light that
[1:34:04] started creating everything so that body
[1:34:08] of light the lust is also called the
[1:34:10] word in the beginning was the word it
[1:34:13] was that body of light are we together I
[1:34:17] want to build a picture here so you can
[1:34:19] see it so when when God created the
[1:34:23] Angels the
[1:34:25] Angels were not they were
[1:34:29] worshiping the
[1:34:31] word the logos whether you want we want
[1:34:34] to call it the word or we want to call
[1:34:36] it the logos they were worshiping the
[1:34:39] word because that was the
[1:34:41] form that they could
[1:34:43] see now what I'm driving to yeah yeah
[1:34:47] you know I want to I want to get to the
[1:34:49] end of my seron before I even stop
[1:34:51] preaching it where I'm driving to here
[1:34:53] is for us to see that the Angels were
[1:34:57] created to income around the
[1:35:02] word so it's the word that attracts them
[1:35:06] the angels of the Lord are Income about
[1:35:10] them that fear Him those that fear the
[1:35:15] word so it's that reverence and respect
[1:35:18] of the word that that attracts them
[1:35:22] that's what I want for us to see that's
[1:35:23] what I want to establish this
[1:35:26] morning praise the Lord they were
[1:35:29] attracted to the word from the beginning
[1:35:31] because it's the word that created them
[1:35:33] that's what they worshiped so they will
[1:35:35] always be attracted to the
[1:35:40] word are we
[1:35:45] together is the light
[1:35:49] on praise the Lord because because if
[1:35:51] the light is on you will see it do you
[1:35:54] see it then the light is on praise the
[1:35:57] Lord let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:36:00] Praise
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:07] amen are we together okay if uh if if
[1:36:12] the light is on you will see it and uh
[1:36:15] uh
[1:36:20] so
[1:36:23] now listen to this at word listen to
[1:36:26] this let's let's take this together just
[1:36:30] want to steady
[1:36:31] here I don't have I don't have time so
[1:36:34] I'm just going to go I believe that even
[1:36:37] the Holy Spirit and
[1:36:41] Angel and all are just attributes of
[1:36:46] God is just a part of
[1:36:49] God it's his
[1:36:53] makeup a part of it that went off his
[1:36:58] spirit and so
[1:37:03] forth praise the Lord
[1:37:10] amen I know the thinkers are
[1:37:13] thinking I want to give you time to
[1:37:16] think praise the
[1:37:18] Lord
[1:37:19] because we have to realize
[1:37:23] this just like we said Wednesday
[1:37:26] night when Paul met those people on M
[1:37:31] hell he told him he said you are very
[1:37:35] superstitious you are saying to the
[1:37:37] unknown God this God you are you you
[1:37:40] trying to worship that you don't know I
[1:37:42] will make him known to
[1:37:45] you even in your own perm you says in
[1:37:50] him we
[1:37:52] move in him we have our
[1:37:56] being praise the Lord you say those
[1:37:59] things but you actually don't understand
[1:38:01] what you are
[1:38:04] saying praise the
[1:38:06] Lord so what we want to we we we want to
[1:38:10] help us to see this morning is
[1:38:13] that everything that God made came out
[1:38:18] of
[1:38:20] him
[1:38:23] everything that God made came out of
[1:38:31] him praise the
[1:38:35] Lord a good friend brother Looney he
[1:38:39] used to have this example Looney Jenkins
[1:38:42] he would say one time the scientist
[1:38:44] wanted to challenge God and say whatever
[1:38:47] you can make we can make the
[1:38:49] same God say okay okay I'm ready for the
[1:38:52] challenge praise the
[1:38:55] Lord the the stage was
[1:39:00] set and they says uh they told God okay
[1:39:03] let's let's get down to what whatever
[1:39:05] you may we can make the same God say
[1:39:08] okay may your own
[1:39:14] Earth made your own
[1:39:17] Earth because everything you have to
[1:39:19] work out of I made it
[1:39:25] are you seeing the picture I'm I'm
[1:39:27] saying this to be able to make the
[1:39:29] picture clear to you that everything
[1:39:32] that God made came out of
[1:39:35] him there is nothing that is made
[1:39:38] without
[1:39:43] him so I don't I don't want us to to to
[1:39:46] stumble of this when brother Bram says
[1:39:48] even the angels and the holy Spirit our
[1:39:51] attribute it's just a chip from the
[1:39:57] oblock praise the
[1:40:03] Lord are you are are we are we
[1:40:06] together amen you can see that's the
[1:40:09] reason why in everything that he made he
[1:40:12] represented
[1:40:15] himself everything that he made he made
[1:40:18] the angel he is the Angel of the
[1:40:20] Covenant
[1:40:21] yeah he make the son he's the he's the
[1:40:24] the the the how do you call it the
[1:40:27] raising son he make the mo he make the
[1:40:29] star he's the nothing star he make the
[1:40:31] tree he call himself the tree of life he
[1:40:34] make the lion he's the lion of the Trap
[1:40:35] of Judah everything that God made came
[1:40:39] out of
[1:40:42] him are you seeing the
[1:40:46] picture
[1:40:48] amen now think about it this this also
[1:40:51] we believe that God is om
[1:40:56] impress okay we believe that he's every
[1:40:59] word but he's not just every word as
[1:41:04] every word is
[1:41:08] everywhere praise the Lord because if
[1:41:11] God is every word God will be right in
[1:41:15] the heart of the
[1:41:18] drunker what makes him every word is his
[1:41:22] ability to know
[1:41:28] everything is his ability to know
[1:41:34] everything are we
[1:41:38] together praise the Lord if he's every
[1:41:42] word as every word is every word then
[1:41:46] there's no need of the Holy
[1:41:49] Ghost
[1:41:57] his ability to know everything there is
[1:42:01] not a fleet that flies that God don't
[1:42:05] know not a bling of an
[1:42:08] eye you can't run too fast that he will
[1:42:10] not see
[1:42:15] you are we
[1:42:19] together
[1:42:24] amen so it is just a chip off of the old
[1:42:28] block the Holy Spirit and angels are all
[1:42:31] just attributes of God it's just a part
[1:42:33] of God it's it's a part of his
[1:42:37] makeup his spirit and so forth that he
[1:42:40] created to be
[1:42:44] helpers Amen in his great office of
[1:42:49] Glory I believe they are just like
[1:42:56] secretaries praise the
[1:42:58] Lord
[1:43:00] amen we have the Holy Ghost it's just
[1:43:04] one Holy Ghost but it's in every one of
[1:43:07] us that have the Holy Ghost this
[1:43:10] morning are we together praise the
[1:43:14] Lord so that's that's i i i i i Dro this
[1:43:18] in year so we can see it he
[1:43:22] created that he created to be helpers
[1:43:25] around in his great office in
[1:43:29] glory just like a secretary and so forth
[1:43:32] to help carry on the master
[1:43:36] work is part of his
[1:43:39] attributes to carry on his
[1:43:42] work to help in the Redemption plan and
[1:43:46] program are we together to help in the
[1:43:49] Redemption plan in
[1:43:52] program now so with that being
[1:43:57] said we
[1:44:00] establish the thought that the Angels
[1:44:04] were first formed created and they
[1:44:07] worship the word they were around the
[1:44:11] lust praise the
[1:44:16] Lord and yeah also we seen that
[1:44:21] they they are they are they are also
[1:44:24] helpers amen they are also
[1:44:31] helpers I hav I having too much to say
[1:44:35] in the sh period of time I'm trying to
[1:44:38] to find a place where I can hold you
[1:44:41] this morning and then I can be able to
[1:44:43] leave you there praise the
[1:44:48] Lord now so you will see that you will
[1:44:52] see that uh let's go to Genesis chapter
[1:44:54] 16 there's another beautiful picture
[1:44:56] there uh it might it might help us
[1:45:00] Genesis chapter 16 there the story of
[1:45:05] hagga that's the story of
[1:45:09] hegar Genesis
[1:45:16] 16 that's the story of
[1:45:18] haar and uh
[1:45:25] we know the
[1:45:27] story he was an Egyptian M that was that
[1:45:30] was with Sarah and I want you to I want
[1:45:33] you to to see the connection here verse
[1:45:36] one now Sarah Abraham's wife be him no
[1:45:40] children and she had an herid an
[1:45:44] Egyptian whose name was hagga now uh uh
[1:45:48] uh it's it's very important for you to
[1:45:50] see that connection you will see where
[1:45:52] it comes where it will make sense to you
[1:45:55] and the scripture says here that uh then
[1:45:58] uh Sarah was the one that uh you know uh
[1:46:01] told Abraham you know I'm getting old I
[1:46:03] can have try take my handmade you know
[1:46:05] maybe you can have uh uh uh you know the
[1:46:08] the promised son you've been talking
[1:46:10] about promised son promised son maybe
[1:46:12] you can have this promised son with her
[1:46:14] now we know that her got you know
[1:46:16] conceived and then her attitude started
[1:46:18] changing now look at ver verse 5 look at
[1:46:22] verse 5 that first phrase in verse 5 is
[1:46:25] a Redemptive phrase the Bible says and
[1:46:28] Sarah said unto Abraham my wrong be upon
[1:46:32] thee do you see
[1:46:34] that amen do you see that it's more than
[1:46:39] a prophecy than just a
[1:46:42] story Abraham was Christ we are
[1:46:46] represented in
[1:46:49] Sarah we must be able to see how he
[1:46:52] takes our
[1:46:56] wrong our Rong is upon
[1:47:01] him okay let's go ahead I have
[1:47:05] given my M onto thy bosom and when she
[1:47:08] saw that she had
[1:47:10] conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the
[1:47:13] Lord judged between me in the and
[1:47:15] Abraham says you know uh that your M
[1:47:17] behold that made is in their hand and as
[1:47:20] it pleased the now what I want to bring
[1:47:23] you to is verse 7 that's verse 7 and and
[1:47:27] we know the Bible talks about falling
[1:47:30] angels you know it's all represented
[1:47:32] there in Genesis chapter 6 and all but
[1:47:34] for the first time that that the word
[1:47:37] the word if you look into your Bible
[1:47:39] search you will see when you put angels
[1:47:41] this will be the first scripture that
[1:47:42] will come up verse seven and the angel
[1:47:46] of the
[1:47:47] Lord found her by a found Fountain of
[1:47:50] water in the wilderness by the fountain
[1:47:54] in the W of sh and he said Hager Sarah's
[1:48:00] made so you see her connection to the
[1:48:04] blessing was
[1:48:06] Sarah and the angel would not despise
[1:48:10] that no matter how much Sarah might have
[1:48:14] been mean to
[1:48:18] her her connection to told the
[1:48:22] blessing was Sarah
[1:48:30] right and the
[1:48:33] angel he said hi G serah mate when came
[1:48:38] it out and and you know the story and
[1:48:40] the angel verse 9 of the Lord said unto
[1:48:44] her return to thy mistress and submit
[1:48:48] thyself honor her
[1:48:53] hand praise the
[1:48:56] Lord so the the picture that here I want
[1:49:00] you to see here is that in in with with
[1:49:05] Abraham H H Abraham and Sarah were
[1:49:08] representing the
[1:49:11] elect
[1:49:13] amen uh uh uh haot is having the
[1:49:17] visitation of an Angel because of her
[1:49:21] connection to the
[1:49:23] elect the person that had the promised
[1:49:26] word from Genesis 12 the man that God
[1:49:30] called the one that God was dealing with
[1:49:32] was
[1:49:34] Abraham praise the Lord angels are in
[1:49:38] come about the
[1:49:40] word they are there to help the promise
[1:49:43] come to
[1:49:47] pass praise the Lord
[1:49:51] are we
[1:49:53] together you see there also with
[1:49:57] aimc when he took Sarah Angels Came on
[1:50:01] the scene he got an Angelic visitation
[1:50:04] why because he was tempering with the
[1:50:12] word praise the
[1:50:15] Lord oh i' I just I want this picture to
[1:50:19] to click because I don't have time
[1:50:23] amen the angels of the Lord are Inc
[1:50:27] about them that fear
[1:50:32] him so it's all about the
[1:50:36] word praise the lord it's all about the
[1:50:41] word let me tell you angels can protect
[1:50:44] you protect you keep you because there
[1:50:47] is a promise to be fulfilled and yet
[1:50:50] your body can go through
[1:50:53] hurt they are not protecting your body
[1:50:56] they are protecting the word they are
[1:50:59] there to keep the
[1:51:02] word am I making
[1:51:06] sense praise the
[1:51:10] Lord the angels of the Lord are in come
[1:51:14] about them that fear
[1:51:18] Him
[1:51:22] praise the Lord you love the
[1:51:27] Lord now this one will be a a a one that
[1:51:30] would be tough for you to
[1:51:33] swallow I'll give you some water to
[1:51:35] drink amen I'll help you for it to get
[1:51:39] down question and answer year the 1964
[1:51:43] listen to this now there is an angel but
[1:51:47] this Angel of the Lord that income about
[1:51:49] those that fear them that fear Him see
[1:51:53] now it is in promise that Sinners has
[1:51:59] angers it's only the
[1:52:02] redeemed has
[1:52:04] Angels sir angels are
[1:52:08] messengers I want you to notice it so
[1:52:13] perfect and it will prove predestination
[1:52:17] yes sir to you
[1:52:20] yes
[1:52:21] sir praise the
[1:52:24] Lord are we
[1:52:27] together are we
[1:52:32] together praise the
[1:52:38] Lord the Angels were created to worship
[1:52:43] the
[1:52:43] word and when they were worshiping the
[1:52:46] word then the word now became an object
[1:52:50] of worship that's where our word god
[1:52:53] came from God is an object of
[1:52:58] worship so you will see that all through
[1:53:03] they are attracted to the
[1:53:05] word they are sent as messenger either
[1:53:09] to bring the word or to protect the
[1:53:14] word are we
[1:53:18] together so
[1:53:20] a person has to be a carrier of the
[1:53:27] word are we
[1:53:36] together a person has to be a carrier of
[1:53:39] the word you see that's the reason why
[1:53:42] that's the reason why you hear the word
[1:53:44] the word the word the word you know uh
[1:53:47] uh uh a brother used to fellowship with
[1:53:50] us he had a friend you know and and and
[1:53:52] he used to meet with me on the Bible
[1:53:54] status we meet during the week and then
[1:53:57] he would said to me and he says uh he
[1:53:59] say I I keep hearing you the word the
[1:54:01] word the
[1:54:02] word you know and uh I I love it I enjoy
[1:54:06] it but you know uh uh and and I know
[1:54:10] where he was
[1:54:12] going where he was going to is that he
[1:54:15] wanted me to give him something to
[1:54:18] practice because religion is easy that
[1:54:21] way it's very easy if you get something
[1:54:24] to practice you know I mean read the
[1:54:28] Bible in the morning pray if you make
[1:54:29] that your
[1:54:30] religion and you can just do that then
[1:54:33] you think that you have done what God
[1:54:36] has required you right but for God it's
[1:54:39] not how it works it's a relationship he
[1:54:43] wanted 24/7 yes

[1:55:08] taking on my church clothes now I I have
[1:55:10] to go you know then then the rest of the
[1:55:12] hour is for the
[1:55:16] devil so I I I saw where he was going
[1:55:19] you know he we will talk about scripture
[1:55:21] things and and uh uh uh you know in in
[1:55:25] my mind I'm saying I'm saying this guy
[1:55:28] is is uh I mean he's he's trying to he's
[1:55:31] trying to it's it's almost like what can
[1:55:34] I do is it's almost like Simon the
[1:55:37] Sorcerer he saw Peter then laying their
[1:55:40] hands on the S he was enjoying it wow
[1:55:42] man I've never seen this
[1:55:45] before at the end of the service he went

[1:55:49] good service
[1:55:50] service Jo what can I do man you know
[1:55:54] what is the requirement to be able to
[1:55:56] get that kind of a power right is it
[1:55:59] money to pay do I need to go to a
[1:56:02] certain
[1:56:04] School Peter say you and your money
[1:56:08] perish praise the Lord and that's what
[1:56:11] people want they don't want you to tell
[1:56:14] them what what what do I need to do to
[1:56:16] belong to this church is it a dress code
[1:56:19] do I need to walk a certain
[1:56:21] way praise the Lord all you need to do

[1:56:27] you are not baptized be baptized in the
[1:56:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[1:56:32] promised to give you the Holy Ghost and
[1:56:35] that's where the journey
[1:56:36] starts praise the Lord and because the

[1:57:03] about is that word because you are a
[1:57:07] carrier of the word there's a
[1:57:09] representation of the word in your

[1:57:15] representation of the word there is an
[1:57:17] angel to watch over that word

[1:57:23] angel to watch over that
[1:57:26] word and the sooner you you you you you

[1:58:56] look beyond that and he dropped a
[1:58:59] representation in your heart and he gave
[1:59:02] his Angel to watch over that
[1:59:09] word praise the Lord Jesus said you have
[1:59:13] not choose me I Choose
[1:59:18] You
[1:59:20] are we
[1:59:28] together are we
[1:59:33] together you see so sometimes you have
[1:59:35] to give the Angels a tough fight when
[1:59:38] you get yourself in wrong
[1:59:41] places praise the Lord and you get
[1:59:44] yourself in wrong places and wrong
[1:59:46] atmosphere and and and and and and and
[1:59:49] think things we do and things we say you
[1:59:51] know uh uh uh brings about evil spirit
[1:59:54] around us listening to the wrong music
[1:59:56] and all of that you get yourself to the
[1:59:58] wrong place then it has to be a blood
[2:00:05] fight just like how the angels have to
[2:00:08] fight when Daniel was praying
[2:00:13] right while you are sleeping angels have
[2:00:16] to get a
[2:00:18] fight
[2:00:20] because those demons want to possess
[2:00:22] your body they want to drag the seed of
[2:00:26] God down in the D and the angel saying
[2:00:28] no way I'm giving charge to watch over
[2:00:31] this
[2:00:32] one yes
[2:00:34] sir praise the
[2:00:36] Lord you wake up in the morning I'm too
[2:00:42] tired I don't even know what to do but
[2:00:45] is my man my
[2:00:47] brain I'm just so tired I don't even
[2:00:49] know what to
[2:00:51] do it almost look like your brain is
[2:00:55] blank praise the Lord because all those
[2:00:58] evil spirit was speeding to take charge
[2:01:00] of you and angels are are trying to
[2:01:03] block them off
[2:01:08] huah if you get up in the
[2:01:12] morning now just one
[2:01:16] choice you're going to make praise the
[2:01:19] Lord
[2:01:23] amen if God will just be
[2:01:26] gracious and you will get up in the
[2:01:28] morning and not run for your phone to
[2:01:31] know what is on Facebook of this and you
[2:01:33] just drop on your knees and you just
[2:01:36] drop on your
[2:01:39] knees or pick up the
[2:01:42] word you have the Angels running your
[2:01:45] way because they are attracted to the
[2:01:48] word
[2:01:50] that's the reason why the last time when
[2:01:52] I said we don't have we never have a
[2:01:54] service with an empty church that's what
[2:01:56] I mean because wherever the word is
[2:01:59] those angels are
[2:02:01] attracted Jesus said whatsoever two or
[2:02:04] three are
[2:02:05] gather I will be there and when he's
[2:02:07] coming he's coming with host of
[2:02:12] angels praise the Lord You Have Become
[2:02:15] Angelic
[2:02:17] Association
[2:02:23] are we
[2:02:25] together glory be to
[2:02:28] God
[2:02:34] Amen my my my
[2:02:38] my it's becoming
[2:02:40] wonderful and the time is clicking it's
[2:02:43] telling me I have 5 minutes 5 minutes
[2:02:45] please close this service please do your
[2:02:47] best
[2:02:49] praise the
[2:02:53] Lord listen to this this will bless your
[2:02:55] heart too brother bam says I pray for
[2:02:57] people I pray for the people they go
[2:03:01] away and if they believe children in the
[2:03:05] wilderness praise the
[2:03:09] Lord they go away and if they
[2:03:12] believe they will get
[2:03:15] well if uh that feel
[2:03:20] th
[2:03:21] faith that prayer is set for that person
[2:03:26] and if they believe it the angel of God
[2:03:30] will watch over that person what is the
[2:03:34] angel watching over the
[2:03:37] word a word has just been applied they
[2:03:40] shall lay their hands upon the
[2:03:43] sck that's the
[2:03:45] word so the angel will watch over over
[2:03:49] that
[2:03:53] person they have to get
[2:03:57] well praise the Lord now you see there
[2:04:00] is a lot of things that works with that
[2:04:02] because I can take this very word they
[2:04:05] shall lay their hands on the sick
[2:04:07] instead of magnifying the word and
[2:04:10] making the people to know we are
[2:04:11] standing on the word of God if it is
[2:04:14] ever in my mind to make you to
[2:04:16] believe that I have some special gift
[2:04:20] right the Angels don't watch over my
[2:04:24] personalities they are sent to watch
[2:04:27] over the
[2:04:30] word so if I'm using the word to boast
[2:04:34] myself and sell myself to you now you
[2:04:37] have to watch also you are a son of God
[2:04:40] you are a daughter of God you have the
[2:04:43] spirit of God you have to wash those
[2:04:47] things don't swallow everything the man
[2:05:01] says brother B says they have to get
[2:05:04] well maybe not that hour maybe not that
[2:05:09] week maybe not that month maybe six
[2:05:14] weeks before they get well but they will
[2:05:17] get well they have got to get
[2:05:21] well if it is something from the word
[2:05:24] the word will not fail the word of God
[2:05:30] works sometimes the thing that will
[2:05:32] prolong it is our fear our doubt because
[2:05:38] when you are entertaining fear and doubt
[2:05:41] angels Don't worship those things Angels
[2:05:44] worship truth Angels worship faith when
[2:05:47] you say I believe believe it the angel
[2:05:49] say amen I believe it
[2:06:03] too let me read this to you we find a
[2:06:07] place to to close I have the rest of the
[2:06:09] year to preach to you
[2:06:11] amen so I'm not going to do all
[2:06:14] today but I think it will help
[2:06:17] you it will help you thank God I'm very
[2:06:21] I'm grateful the reason why I'm grateful
[2:06:24] is because I think uh I think the Holy
[2:06:27] Spirit have established what we want to
[2:06:28] say to you I think he has giving you a
[2:06:31] picture father the hour has come brother
[2:06:33] Bram say and he says uh uh uh the time
[2:06:37] had come after Jesus died after Calvary
[2:06:40] the time come that he must die for the
[2:06:44] sin of the
[2:06:46] word and he died just I call him to the
[2:06:50] scripture praise the Lord he di that's
[2:06:53] why Paul said in
[2:06:54] Corinthian cause everybody believe that
[2:06:58] line with the word when the time comes
[2:07:02] that it must be fulfilled and he died
[2:07:05] between two male factors they went by
[2:07:09] breaking their legs with Harmon and the
[2:07:13] Roman rise back their M now brother BR
[2:07:16] is is describing you Jesus by according
[2:07:19] to the
[2:07:21] scripture as as the evening time was
[2:07:23] coming the Roman soldier went with his
[2:07:27] hammer whatever he had in his hands
[2:07:30] trying to make sure that all of these
[2:07:31] guys on the cross is dead and he went
[2:07:35] breaking their legs and breaking their
[2:07:36] legs Jesus died according to the
[2:07:39] scripture and the scripture said now one
[2:07:42] of his bones will be
[2:07:45] broken so as he went about breaking the
[2:07:48] people bones when he got to
[2:07:52] Jesus now listen to what he said I read
[2:07:55] it to you he say an angel was
[2:07:59] there to make sure the word will not be
[2:08:08] broken praise the
[2:08:12] Lord he's in the middle how can you mess
[2:08:17] it why are you come from left to right
[2:08:19] you have to pass by the one in the
[2:08:21] middle how can you miss
[2:08:24] itall but an angel was
[2:08:27] there why because the angel must watch
[2:08:30] over the
[2:08:35] word you want to bring Angeles to your
[2:08:38] room stay in the
[2:08:41] word you want Angelic
[2:08:44] visitation stay in the
[2:08:47] word praise the Lord
[2:08:52] Lord he said what was it the angel of
[2:08:56] God stay at
[2:08:58] hand the time had come for the scripture
[2:09:02] to be
[2:09:04] fulfilled the same thing the Bible said
[2:09:07] talk about the the uh you know he will
[2:09:10] not see
[2:09:11] corruption praise the Lord it was a word
[2:09:16] and when that time came the the Angels
[2:09:19] Came and put those soldiers to
[2:09:21] sleep those Roman soldiers that were
[2:09:23] guiding guiding the tomb if they ever
[2:09:26] had a good night's sleep deep
[2:09:31] sleep deep
[2:09:35] sleep until they were snoring to their
[2:09:43] best because there is a word that must
[2:09:45] not be
