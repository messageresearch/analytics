[41:34] ephesians chapter three
[41:38] let's take efficient chapter three uh
[41:44] oh yeah and i knew where i got stuck
[41:47] a new way i got stuck i knew
[41:50] i knew there there was something i
[41:52] wanted to do in and it just slipped my
[41:54] mind in
[41:55] and i've asked you to stand so we would
[41:57] do that maybe at the end of the service
[42:00] this uh this uh song
[42:03] from the la fountains sanka

[42:11] uh have a cassette of faith
[42:14] it says you look more like your father

[42:18] so i took i tried to write the chorus of
[42:20] the song that's what i wanted for us to
[42:22] practice

[42:26] already dismissed the musician so
[42:29] let's just read the word of the lord we
[42:32] will see if we can
[42:34] we can make a little singing of that at
[42:37] the end of the service praise the lord
[42:39] maybe maybe the good lord knows that the
[42:43] atmosphere
[42:44] is right and my singing might destroy it
[42:47] so
[42:48] he hold my mind back to forget about it
[42:51] he said son the atmosphere is just right
[42:54] for me
[42:55] so don't come and play into it and i
[42:57] thank the lord for that amen
[43:00] because he's our help ephesians chapter
[43:02] 3
[43:04] now we've been talking about this
[43:06] revelation of jesus christ
[43:08] and uh is it's
[43:12] kind of for
[43:15] getting getting bigger getting larger
[43:17] because
[43:18] great is the mystery of godliness amen
[43:21] is something that you can just
[43:23] put your mind around you can just take
[43:25] one verse from the bible
[43:27] and and and and be able to justify
[43:30] yourself onto it
[43:32] let's read from verse eight i will i
[43:34] will take from verse eight year
[43:36] because reading from verse one paul goes
[43:39] into
[43:40] a lot of different things about this
[43:42] mystery
[43:43] but from verse 8 he says unto me that's
[43:45] the apostle paul
[43:47] whoa i'm least then the least
[43:53] of all sins i'm less than the least of
[43:55] all sins
[43:57] is this grace giving that i should
[44:00] preach among the gentiles
[44:02] the unsearchable riches of christ
[44:06] and to make all men see
[44:09] what is the fellowship of
[44:12] the mystery so you see we are
[44:15] fellowshipping with
[44:16] a mystery we are fellowshipping with a
[44:18] mysterious god
[44:21] that we cannot just
[44:24] keep him in titles
[44:27] we are fellowshipping with a mystical
[44:30] body
[44:31] amen fellowship
[44:34] with the mystery it becomes so sweet
[44:38] amen
[44:40] praise the lord i might just change my
[44:42] subject this morning and preach on
[44:43] fellowship with the mystery
[44:46] amen the mystery
[44:49] wish from the beginning of the world
[44:53] had been hid in god
[44:57] that mystery was hid in god
[45:01] who created all things by jesus christ
[45:06] i thought the scripture said in the
[45:08] beginning god created heaven and earth
[45:13] and yet paul is saying he created all
[45:15] things by jesus christ
[45:22] am i reading something different or that
[45:24] is it how it is in your in your bible
[45:28] the god that had the mystery hidden in
[45:30] him
[45:31] created all things by jesus christ
[45:37] now you gotta remember revelation
[45:39] chapter one now
[45:41] the revelation that god gave unto him
[45:44] jesus
[45:49] created all things by jesus christ
[45:53] to the intent that now onto
[45:57] the principalities and power in heavenly
[45:59] places
[46:00] the lord bless you you may have your
[46:01] seed as we continue to read
[46:04] might be known by the church
[46:10] the men for wisdom of god i according to
[46:14] the internal purpose which he purpose in
[46:17] christ
[46:20] jesus our lord amen
[46:23] in whom we have boldness
[46:28] and asses with confidence
[46:31] by the faith in him wherefore
[46:34] i desire that that if net
[46:38] at my tribulation with you
[46:42] which is your glory
[46:45] verse 14 for this cause
[46:48] i bow my knees unto the father
[46:52] of our lord jesus christ
[46:56] of whom the whole family
[46:59] in heaven and earth is named
[47:02] so what the whole family name
[47:06] what is god's family name that's what
[47:09] paul is saying here
[47:11] by my knees unto the father of our lord
[47:15] jesus christ
[47:16] of whom the whole family
[47:20] in heaven and earth
[47:23] so we're going to talk on the family
[47:25] name this morning
[47:29] the family name praise the lord
[47:33] amen of whom the whole family
[47:36] in heaven and earth is named
[47:39] that he who grants you a calling to the
[47:43] riches
[47:43] of his glory to be strengthened
[47:47] with might by his spirit
[47:50] in the inner man praise the lord
[47:58] i'm going to talk on family name
[48:01] family name and uh and
[48:04] what i was looking at is i was trying to
[48:07] to look at in in there there's there are
[48:10] amazing signs
[48:11] out there amazing science you see all of
[48:14] these
[48:15] technology there they are building all
[48:18] of these things
[48:20] and now they have they have facial
[48:22] recognition
[48:24] and all of these things with facial
[48:26] recognition
[48:29] and then you you think about it now you
[48:31] have to realize
[48:33] that science has broken into god's
[48:35] laboratory that's what
[48:37] brother branham told us and he says he
[48:40] says one of these days signs might find
[48:42] god quicker than the preacher is
[48:43] if we don't get down and start studying
[48:45] god's word
[48:46] signs will get a hold of god quicker
[48:48] than we will do
[48:49] that's why he said because those people
[48:52] they are breaking
[48:53] and i was just thinking about it now
[48:55] we're having all these
[48:56] uh visual services and visual meetings
[48:59] and
[49:00] and brothers have even been able to have
[49:03] conventions you know they have been able
[49:07] to have conventions
[49:08] around the world you know uh uh
[49:11] brothers preaching uh from from this
[49:14] place and preaching from that place
[49:16] and and even one night but the area have
[49:18] to help me uh about three a.m to preach
[49:20] it
[49:21] over in south africa and i was just
[49:23] thinking about that
[49:24] one of these days in asia yeah i think i
[49:27] think uh
[49:30] i need to look into this i need a new
[49:32] preach on this
[49:33] because what it is is that
[49:37] paul says in the book of hebrew he says
[49:41] we have a cloud of witnesses
[49:45] amen while we are in service this
[49:48] morning
[49:49] and and and the bride and christians
[49:52] around the world are in service
[49:54] there are people that are looking from
[49:56] the brightness of heaven
[49:58] and looking down you know on
[50:01] us we have this cloud of witness you
[50:04] know so
[50:04] so uh uh virtual service has been going
[50:07] on long time before coronavirus
[50:11] praise the lord amen it's it's not a new
[50:14] thinker
[50:15] you know uh uh uh to to the people of
[50:18] god
[50:18] because we know uh uh you know heavenly
[50:21] host in the in
[50:23] things that have gone on before has been
[50:25] looking down on us so i was
[50:26] i was reading this thing uh uh and and
[50:30] some
[50:30] some scientists from from uh from
[50:34] from jerusalem hebrew scientists and and
[50:36] they were looking into
[50:38] the amazing fact of facial recognition
[50:43] you know and uh how
[50:47] that uh there is there is such a science
[50:50] in it how can this think this this
[50:53] material that can
[50:54] you smash on the ground right now you
[50:56] just shut it into
[50:58] but there is social intelligence that is
[51:00] built in it
[51:01] that you know
[51:05] when i put a facial recognition on it
[51:08] comes out it brings a square they try to
[51:10] get my face
[51:11] you know and uh and it and and by that
[51:14] facial recognition
[51:16] it can also be able to detect my name
[51:25] praise the lord they can be able to
[51:27] detect my name
[51:28] and and and and the science is so
[51:31] amazing
[51:32] out there and and it's all because
[51:35] it's from the great god you know when
[51:37] science
[51:39] discover the dna code
[51:43] when they discover the dna code they
[51:46] reveal
[51:47] they went back and changed a lot of
[51:50] their their scientific teachings
[51:54] because the dna court
[51:57] put signs into a corner
[52:00] that is hard for them to for them to
[52:03] deny that there is not an intelligence
[52:06] that put this world together
[52:09] amen
[52:13] all the evolution curating all the
[52:16] theory that they have
[52:17] but when they came to the place where
[52:19] they discovered the dna code
[52:23] they put them to the corner they have to
[52:24] go back instead reviewing
[52:26] and changing some of their teachings
[52:30] and as i was studying last night i was
[52:31] just looking into different things
[52:34] and uh
[52:37] and just one that is common is that
[52:41] we all have met somebody that says oh
[52:44] you look like somebody i know
[52:48] that's right yes sir
[52:52] and have you all also experienced word
[52:57] you hear a certain name and just by the
[53:00] sound of that name
[53:02] you put a face to it
[53:08] you put a face to the name you you even
[53:11] put a structure he's a huge guy
[53:15] you have never met this person you have
[53:18] never seen them
[53:19] it's just by the sound of your name
[53:25] something in you just just create
[53:28] a picture
[53:33] praise the lord what an amazing word
[53:37] that we are living in
[53:39] amen and think about this other
[53:43] fact also
[53:47] a man from another
[53:50] country or another city
[53:54] gets married to a woman and after
[53:58] a couple of years
[54:03] people say you look alike
[54:08] you look alike praise the lord
[54:12] and i was reading the testimony about uh
[54:15] a couple that it actually embarrassed
[54:20] them
[54:20] they had to go and do a dna to find out
[54:22] that they were not related
[54:25] because everywhere they show up people
[54:26] says wow is that your sister
[54:28] no that's my wife oh my goodness y'all
[54:30] look alike
[54:33] the lady said she got she got so scared
[54:36] that she and her husband have to go and
[54:39] and do
[54:39] uh uh some uh some some some dna tests
[54:43] to make sure that down the line they
[54:46] never came from some
[54:47] grandparents
[54:51] by one block god made all men
[54:54] that's right praise the lord
[54:57] amen the next time you see someone that
[55:00] looked just like me
[55:02] it was the sales that just broke out of
[55:04] me you mean
[55:07] praise the lord we don't have to come
[55:08] from the same father or
[55:10] the same mother so we want to talk about
[55:12] the family name
[55:14] and all that drove me into this was how
[55:17] how family name how family resemblance
[55:22] comes together you know
[55:26] how family name brave family resemblance
[55:32] someone know a relative of yours or know
[55:35] maybe your parent or know a sister of
[55:37] yours
[55:38] and and they hear your name and says
[55:41] well
[55:42] are you related to this say yeah y'all
[55:45] look alike
[55:49] it's not actually that they they look at
[55:52] your future but the name
[55:54] just the family name brings in a
[56:00] resemblance
[56:02] praise the lord what i mean the science
[56:06] is
[56:07] uh it's it's kind of fascinating out
[56:10] there
[56:10] uh uh and and and you know and talking
[56:14] about it this way is not
[56:16] driving you into a a science teaching
[56:21] but the fact of the matter there is that
[56:23] all of these things that god
[56:26] like like paul said in romans chapter
[56:28] one the the
[56:30] the the the visible things
[56:34] amen the things that god has made is out
[56:38] there in nature
[56:39] there are a lot of things out there in
[56:41] nature that we don't need a bible to
[56:44] believe that there is god but because
[56:47] man will not believe it now science is
[56:50] making those things
[56:51] tangible right brother that's right
[56:54] they are making it tangible by putting
[56:56] it in a cell phone
[56:58] when jesus says speak the word and
[57:01] whatever you ask the father
[57:03] it will be given to you it's hard for us
[57:06] to believe it but science has make it
[57:08] tangible
[57:08] and you can say siri where is mcdonald's
[57:13] and seriously my dad was right around
[57:15] the corner
[57:19] but that's what jesus said long time ago
[57:22] that's what god has given to you
[57:26] you could step into there by faith
[57:31] so science is making it tangible yes
[57:35] that's all science is doing they are not
[57:38] creators
[57:43] they are just making the creation
[57:46] more visible that's right
[57:55] are we together amen
[58:00] so paul says here about my knees
[58:04] unto the father of our lord jesus christ
[58:06] of whom the whole family
[58:08] in heaven and earth is name so we want
[58:11] to talk about the family name
[58:13] this morning and because we have a
[58:16] family name it has given us the family
[58:18] resemblance
[58:20] that's why we want to look at this
[58:21] morning as chapter
[58:23] 4 verse 12. as chapter 4
[58:28] verse 12. that was where the apostle
[58:32] says
[58:33] neither is the salvation in any other
[58:36] for
[58:37] there is none other name on the heaven
[58:41] giving them one name whereby
[58:44] we may be saved no other name
[58:48] except the name of our lord jesus christ
[58:51] amen and the scripture also make us to
[58:54] know at the mission of the name jesus
[58:56] christ every knee shall bow
[58:58] every tongue we confess so god have
[59:01] exalted that name
[59:06] he has taken it as his family name
[59:09] paul says the family in heaven and the
[59:12] family on earth
[59:18] are we together yeah praise the lord
[59:21] uh exodus and since we we're trying to
[59:24] uh uh run a little bit let's run amen
[59:30] we can run let's run we can run stay
[59:33] yes praise the lord
[59:36] amen that was the way that got us
[59:38] running when we were little
[59:40] we can run let's run we can run stay
[59:48] exodus chapter 23 verse 10 verse 20
[59:52] god bless his name in an angel
[59:56] now let's let's read that
[59:59] and just build this a little bit here
[1:00:02] and then we will we will run with that
[1:00:06] exodus chapter
[1:00:07] 3 i mean chapter 23
[1:00:11] uh behold i sent my angel before thee
[1:00:15] to keep me in the way and to bring thee
[1:00:18] into a place
[1:00:19] which i have prepared
[1:00:24] be word of him and obey his voice
[1:00:26] provoke him that
[1:00:28] for he will now pardon your
[1:00:30] transgression
[1:00:32] for my name is in him
[1:00:37] praise the lord now this is the almighty
[1:00:39] god
[1:00:40] elohim god speaking to moses and the
[1:00:42] children of israel
[1:00:44] that he had placed his name and we know
[1:00:47] a name is not just the sound
[1:00:50] of a word a name is
[1:00:54] more than the sound of the word the name
[1:00:56] is a characteristics
[1:01:00] amen is a characteristic it's the nature
[1:01:05] of an individual it's not just the sound
[1:01:07] of a word john peter no it's not just
[1:01:10] the pronunciation of a word but the name
[1:01:13] so
[1:01:13] in this place that that god is speaking
[1:01:16] here
[1:01:16] because that angel was the injured of
[1:01:19] the lord the angel was not called
[1:01:21] anything different but the injured of
[1:01:22] the lord
[1:01:23] but yet god is saying i have put my
[1:01:25] characteristics
[1:01:26] in this angel that is going to lead you
[1:01:31] amen i've put my characteristics in him
[1:01:35] he's not an ordinary angel
[1:01:41] praise the lord so he said beware
[1:01:45] don't provoke him to anger are we
[1:01:48] together
[1:01:51] deuteronomy chapter uh uh 12 verse 5
[1:01:56] the scripture here will show us that god
[1:02:00] put his name in a place
[1:02:05] he put his name in a place no wonder why
[1:02:08] places a name after people
[1:02:12] amen liberia our capital
[1:02:16] was named after james morrow they called
[1:02:18] it monrovia
[1:02:20] but out of all of these things a word
[1:02:23] it shows a a a a little sense
[1:02:27] of of of god's attribute being
[1:02:30] manifested here
[1:02:31] the scripture says in deuteronomy
[1:02:33] chapter 12 verse 5
[1:02:35] but unto the place which the lord your
[1:02:38] god shall
[1:02:39] choose out of all your tribes
[1:02:43] to put his name there even
[1:02:46] unto his habitation
[1:02:49] shaiya sikh and federer
[1:02:55] thou shalt come now so we we see here
[1:02:59] god place his name now this this place
[1:03:03] was the chosen place of worship as it
[1:03:06] was called or true
[1:03:07] or through uh the scripture a place that
[1:03:10] god had
[1:03:11] choose to put his name and and he says
[1:03:14] that's the only place he was going
[1:03:16] to meet man for fellowship
[1:03:19] praise the lord second chronicles
[1:03:23] chapter 7
[1:03:24] also show us it's another favorite
[1:03:27] scripture we read
[1:03:28] it show us that god put his name in the
[1:03:31] people
[1:03:32] a people that are called by my name
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:40] if the people that are called by my name
[1:03:43] will humble themselves
[1:03:48] praise the lord
[1:03:55] the people that are called by my name
[1:03:57] will humble themselves
[1:03:59] and turn from their evil ways
[1:04:03] are we together now so we see these
[1:04:07] things
[1:04:08] out here how god
[1:04:12] almighty god putting his name
[1:04:16] in an anger
[1:04:19] amen he put his name in a place to meet
[1:04:22] his people
[1:04:26] and he put his name among his people
[1:04:29] he put his name a people that are called
[1:04:31] by my name
[1:04:33] a people that are identified by my name
[1:04:39] are we together
[1:04:43] now but all through
[1:04:46] the old covenant or the old testament
[1:04:51] god never took on a name
[1:04:58] amen it said in the book of of
[1:05:01] of uh exeter
[1:05:04] he says my name jehovah was never made
[1:05:07] known among them
[1:05:11] he never he never took on a name
[1:05:16] but he was called means by different
[1:05:20] manifestation when he held his hands up
[1:05:24] he became their defense amen
[1:05:28] the children of israel saw just by
[1:05:31] holding moses hands
[1:05:32] up how god fought their battle
[1:05:35] and they said the lord god is our
[1:05:37] defense
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:47] abraham witness right on the mountain
[1:05:53] when there was when there was when there
[1:05:55] was no
[1:05:56] uh uh hurts there was no shepherd there
[1:05:59] was nobody up that mountain
[1:06:01] just abraham and isaac
[1:06:04] and he witnessed god creating
[1:06:08] a lamb
[1:06:11] god almighty god creating a lamb
[1:06:14] and sticking the lamb in the ticket
[1:06:21] he witnessing it
[1:06:27] praise the lord amen just at the time he
[1:06:30] was bringing
[1:06:31] the the the the sacrificial knife
[1:06:34] down on his son god had his hands
[1:06:41] by seeing god creating an
[1:06:44] alarm and and and and sticking it in the
[1:06:48] bush
[1:06:48] abraham says he's jehovah jarrah amen
[1:06:54] god will provide
[1:06:59] for himself yes amen
[1:07:03] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:07:06] amen god will provide
[1:07:09] for himself if god is giving you a job
[1:07:13] he's providing for himself
[1:07:16] because he's uh he's he's glorifying i
[1:07:19] mean
[1:07:19] he's keeping his promise he's the
[1:07:22] sustainer of life
[1:07:26] there are people that don't they don't
[1:07:28] go to church yeah they are 80 years they
[1:07:30] are angry in their spirit against god
[1:07:32] but yet they seize god's provision
[1:07:39] he's provided for them because he's not
[1:07:42] providing for you
[1:07:43] he's providing for himself because he's
[1:07:46] the father of this household
[1:07:48] called the word and if your father
[1:07:50] cannot take care of his own
[1:07:51] that's right and he's undefeated our god
[1:07:54] is not on the
[1:07:55] so god provide for himself
[1:08:02] that's why the believer grabbed the
[1:08:04] revelation
[1:08:07] when god provides for him he knows that
[1:08:10] god has provide for himself
[1:08:14] so he take the tenth of it and give it
[1:08:17] back and say lord
[1:08:18] this is what you provided for yourself
[1:08:23] that's a pain tire it has to be a
[1:08:25] revelation it's not a it's not a
[1:08:27] combining
[1:08:31] amen like it was in the old testament
[1:08:33] it's a revelation
[1:08:34] in the new testament church
[1:08:41] praise the lord and if god does not give
[1:08:44] you a victory in thy area
[1:08:46] you will just be denying yourself from
[1:08:48] the blessing
[1:08:50] amen so all of all of these names
[1:08:53] jehovah
[1:08:54] jarrah and jehovah you know uh uh uh
[1:08:57] testing our the lord our righteousness
[1:08:59] you know dearly jeremiah
[1:09:01] and all of these was was for from some
[1:09:04] form of manifestation
[1:09:06] the way god showed himself
[1:09:10] and the people of god cried out but
[1:09:13] there was not
[1:09:14] an ethnic name this is the beauty
[1:09:17] about the name of jesus that even before
[1:09:20] he was born
[1:09:21] there were many children it just is it's
[1:09:24] just the same thing as
[1:09:25] joshua jehovah's savior
[1:09:30] so that name is god taking on an ethnic
[1:09:34] name
[1:09:36] god identifying himself with humanity
[1:09:41] praise the lord amen
[1:09:44] god taking on an effluent name
[1:09:48] why because god materializing himself
[1:09:53] like we said wednesday night god
[1:09:55] bringing himself to dust
[1:09:57] was the desire of the father
[1:10:03] was to break himself down
[1:10:09] man that's the reason why they're over
[1:10:11] in
[1:10:12] in genesis
[1:10:17] god said let us make man in our image
[1:10:19] because man
[1:10:21] is the highest form
[1:10:24] of of god's revelation
[1:10:30] amen the highest form
[1:10:33] of god's revelation that's why he kept
[1:10:37] there for the last
[1:10:38] after he has made everything he says now
[1:10:42] this is my my greatest expression
[1:10:47] are we together
[1:10:53] so we're talking on the family name here
[1:10:57] praise the lord
[1:11:02] he promised spoke through isaiah unto us
[1:11:06] a virgin shall conceive
[1:11:07] his name would be called emmanuel it was
[1:11:10] just
[1:11:11] a manifestation
[1:11:15] you know it was a manifestation it was a
[1:11:17] covenant
[1:11:18] emmanuel means god with us
[1:11:23] praise the lord
[1:11:28] but the angel told mary
[1:11:31] his name will be called jesus
[1:11:34] for he will save his people
[1:11:38] from their sin
[1:11:41] he was not the first one called jesus
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:50] but he came and he took on that earthly
[1:11:54] name
[1:11:57] to identify himself with his attributes
[1:12:01] to identify himself with us
[1:12:04] he could have come right from the cross
[1:12:06] the the cradles of heaven
[1:12:08] being escorted by angels but he came by
[1:12:12] the way of our birth
[1:12:16] amen and he took on an effort named
[1:12:23] but god
[1:12:27] has made that name
[1:12:31] like the apostle said amen he says
[1:12:35] god has made this jesus both
[1:12:38] lord and christ
[1:12:43] this jesus that's what we're talking
[1:12:46] about
[1:12:47] this morning family name
[1:12:50] i believe every one of us in here
[1:12:55] have a family name
[1:13:01] and all of us are proud of our family
[1:13:04] name
[1:13:05] if you are not proud of your family name
[1:13:07] i would say it's a shame on you
[1:13:10] praise the lord
[1:13:16] should be proud of your family name
[1:13:20] why should you be proud because please
[1:13:22] god put you in that family
[1:13:24] it's please god to put a predestinated
[1:13:27] seat
[1:13:28] in that family watch over you over four
[1:13:31] generation
[1:13:34] praise the lord amen
[1:13:42] if you if you don't appreciate your
[1:13:44] natural family name
[1:13:47] you will not be able to appreciate your
[1:13:50] spiritual family name
[1:13:51] that comes by revelation
[1:13:55] wars are fought for principles i mean
[1:13:58] people will fight you
[1:14:00] if you mispronounce their family name
[1:14:05] i mean they will get so mad with you
[1:14:08] praise the lord
[1:14:10] amen i always like it when people tell
[1:14:13] me
[1:14:14] oh i thought you were asian
[1:14:20] because my family name tricked him oh
[1:14:24] yeah
[1:14:24] swore i thought you were asian
[1:14:28] it gave me an opportunity to give them a
[1:14:30] little bit of my history
[1:14:32] because they want to know where you got
[1:14:33] that name from
[1:14:35] praise the lord but you know like we
[1:14:38] were talking on the family tree brother
[1:14:40] branham says i can't break on my family
[1:14:42] tree
[1:14:44] you know he says i can break on my on my
[1:14:47] family train

[1:14:59] break on our family tree
[1:15:02] praise the lord none of us can break on
[1:15:05] our family tree
[1:15:10] but we we we're talking about the family
[1:15:12] name here
[1:15:13] and uh uh it's it's uh
[1:15:17] it's very interesting as we look at this
[1:15:20] because
[1:15:22] uh this family name has has has
[1:15:25] has brought a resemblance
[1:15:28] you know just like i said you know uh uh
[1:15:33] people being called by the scene and
[1:15:34] says oh yeah i can see you look just
[1:15:36] like your brother
[1:15:38] you know it is only because they know
[1:15:40] that name
[1:15:41] it's not because they really know you
[1:15:44] you know that's not the name it's called
[1:15:45] you identify with that name
[1:15:47] and appearance just come oh i can see
[1:15:49] yeah i can see i see why i was just
[1:15:51] looking
[1:15:52] at you you were looking because you were
[1:15:54] just looking
[1:15:58] praise the lord amen brother says some
[1:16:01] few things here
[1:16:02] uh let's let's go ahead so we can be
[1:16:05] able to catch ourselves yet a little bit
[1:16:07] i love to talk to uh young people after
[1:16:11] service
[1:16:11] he says he says do you realize this is
[1:16:14] uh
[1:16:16] uh the prophet elijah do you realize
[1:16:18] that
[1:16:20] you are an individual
[1:16:24] unit of god yourself
[1:16:27] a man an individual unit of god
[1:16:32] yourself
[1:16:34] he says they tell me i look like my
[1:16:37] father
[1:16:39] and he was about my size
[1:16:43] that's my father well if we are
[1:16:46] christians
[1:16:48] then we all have
[1:16:52] some mark of our
[1:16:56] heavenly father don't you think so
[1:17:02] our spirit
[1:17:05] will take on that reverence
[1:17:08] that he will have in the meeting
[1:17:13] for he was i mean
[1:17:17] for he was being glorified
[1:17:20] praise the lord amen
[1:17:24] thank you lord so what what
[1:17:27] what happens in the in in the natural
[1:17:31] uh uh uh that's what happens
[1:17:34] in the spiritual you know actually i was
[1:17:36] thinking about
[1:17:37] i've been thinking about it maybe the
[1:17:39] law gave us privilege to look into that
[1:17:42] i want to speak on from the invincible
[1:17:44] to the visible
[1:17:45] the invisible god being expressed
[1:17:49] visible because what happened is that
[1:17:52] this
[1:17:52] was an internal god an invisible god
[1:17:55] like paul said in the book of collusion
[1:17:56] the invisible god
[1:17:59] amen he said christ is the image of the
[1:18:02] invisible god
[1:18:05] so this invisible god kept expressing
[1:18:09] himself
[1:18:10] kept trying to make himself known
[1:18:14] kept trying to make himself known
[1:18:17] through moses through david through the
[1:18:19] prophet
[1:18:20] he kept bringing his picture more
[1:18:22] clearer more clearer
[1:18:24] more clearer and then when it came to
[1:18:26] christ the full
[1:18:28] image appeared
[1:18:34] but after christ he started going back
[1:18:38] he started going back he started going
[1:18:40] back
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:43] that's the reason why he poured his
[1:18:45] spirit
[1:18:46] in the church and not his person not his
[1:18:50] physical appearance
[1:18:51] because he's going back from visible to
[1:18:54] invisible
[1:18:56] that's the reason why there's an
[1:18:57] invisible union going on
[1:19:14] amen amen
[1:19:18] amen hallelujah praise the lord while
[1:19:22] some people can keep
[1:19:24] victory 1957 listening to this you
[1:19:26] appreciate it
[1:19:27] you notice how beautiful it is to go
[1:19:31] into your bedroom at night
[1:19:34] i do to my little boy and stand there
[1:19:39] with little joseph and my wife
[1:19:43] and we kiss him from one side of the
[1:19:45] cheek to the other
[1:19:47] as as as we lead him to bed
[1:19:50] and i said mom he's speaking to his wife
[1:19:53] you know
[1:19:54] he got your eyes something like
[1:19:58] like yours and she said yeah
[1:20:02] and he kind of put
[1:20:05] it in uh in mind of you
[1:20:11] where his mouth shaped and so far
[1:20:16] it's the resemblance of the holy warlock
[1:20:21] the marriage brings a resemblance
[1:20:27] amen amen is the resemblance
[1:20:31] of the holy well amen
[1:20:36] hallelujah are we together
[1:20:40] so every son of god
[1:20:44] every daughter of god has
[1:20:48] a look of the father
[1:20:54] praise the lord there is a resemblance
[1:20:59] the the the holy warlock
[1:21:02] the resemblance of the holy warlord and
[1:21:05] when god
[1:21:05] looked upon adam and eve
[1:21:10] and seeing it was they resembled him
[1:21:13] for it was made in his image
[1:21:17] how he kissed him and how his great
[1:21:20] heart must have failed
[1:21:22] to realize that he have expressed
[1:21:26] himself
[1:21:28] amen yes he has expressed himself
[1:21:32] now that he made an image that just
[1:21:34] looked like him
[1:21:35] but he has expressed himself he has
[1:21:38] he has he has got a man and a woman that
[1:21:42] he can live through
[1:21:43] that will fulfill his desire yes
[1:21:51] are we together now this is
[1:21:54] this is the purpose of the church this
[1:21:57] is the mystery of god
[1:21:59] this is the thing that god had in his
[1:22:01] mind
[1:22:02] god purpose was not to make ten thousand
[1:22:04] denominations of different names and
[1:22:06] different beliefs
[1:22:08] god's purpose was to get a people
[1:22:11] that he can express himself
[1:22:18] are we together that he can express
[1:22:20] himself true
[1:22:24] so we know there's a resemblance of the
[1:22:26] holy warlock
[1:22:28] it brings on a resemblance
[1:22:32] and and that resemblance is not only
[1:22:34] expressed in the child
[1:22:36] that resembles starts to express
[1:22:42] in the husband and the wife
[1:22:45] amen when a husband and wife
[1:22:49] fuss all the time people say they are
[1:22:51] living just like dog and cat dog and cat
[1:22:53] does not resemble
[1:22:57] amen oh because they're fuss all the
[1:23:00] time
[1:23:00] the people two people just like dog and
[1:23:02] cat
[1:23:03] but when they respect one another
[1:23:08] amen when they respect one another
[1:23:14] and that union starts to create a
[1:23:18] resemblance
[1:23:22] praise the lord i mean
[1:23:26] the union starts to create a resemblance
[1:23:30] and that is the same thing with the
[1:23:32] church
[1:23:34] our union with christ is creating a
[1:23:38] resemblance
[1:23:40] we know what he loved and what he
[1:23:41] disliked
[1:23:45] praise the lord even in a friendship
[1:23:48] it does it's not only in an embarrassed
[1:23:51] relationship even in friendship
[1:23:53] of two friends when we learn to respect
[1:23:57] one another amen
[1:24:00] and we learn the like and dislike of one
[1:24:03] another not one person trying to
[1:24:06] impose their selfish ambition on the
[1:24:08] other person
[1:24:10] trying to enslave the other person but
[1:24:12] we respect one another
[1:24:13] pretty soon people will think that you
[1:24:15] are brothers
[1:24:19] they will start to see some kind of a
[1:24:21] resemblance it might not be a facial
[1:24:23] resemblance
[1:24:25] but they see a resemblance of
[1:24:28] understanding
[1:24:31] a resemblance word you are seeking my
[1:24:34] interest
[1:24:34] and i'm seeking your interest it's not a
[1:24:38] resemblance word
[1:24:39] i'm i'm tearing your name apart
[1:24:42] there's no resemblance in that
[1:24:50] are we together
[1:25:03] when a man and a woman come honor
[1:25:08] that coveted by their vow to one another
[1:25:14] they put themselves on a knee
[1:25:18] praise the lord amen
[1:25:21] they put themselves honor in him
[1:25:25] and if you respect if we respect that
[1:25:29] that union that covenant because we have
[1:25:31] to know is god
[1:25:32] the creator the one that created
[1:25:35] man in his image male and female
[1:25:39] he's the one that that set that coveted
[1:25:43] and we can never be able to uh uh
[1:25:46] achieve the resemblance
[1:25:51] just by the woman leaving her father's
[1:25:53] name and taking the man's the man's
[1:25:55] father's name you can have the same name
[1:25:57] people know that y'all are not the same
[1:26:00] because there's nothing that shows only
[1:26:03] a name
[1:26:10] are we together and we can all come
[1:26:14] under the same name we are christians
[1:26:19] but there is no resemblance
[1:26:22] because we are baptist blue metal is
[1:26:24] green
[1:26:27] and we want to show that we are the best
[1:26:29] we are more spiritual
[1:26:30] than any church on this block
[1:26:35] that does not resemble the father
[1:26:38] amen that does not resemble the father
[1:26:42] you know what resembled him he was
[1:26:45] called juan berbers
[1:26:47] because he was sticking friendship with
[1:26:49] the low-class people
[1:27:01] he loved the homeless because he knew
[1:27:03] that this world was not his home
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:13] are we together so there is something
[1:27:18] about
[1:27:19] there is something about name there is
[1:27:22] there is
[1:27:23] something about about name that is that
[1:27:26] is
[1:27:26] so powerful verb benham said this now
[1:27:29] look at this
[1:27:31] look at this under the context of this
[1:27:33] message that he preached spiritual
[1:27:35] ammunition verbal says our natural birth
[1:27:38] immediately put us on a spiritual
[1:27:41] harmony
[1:27:42] we all were born in this world with
[1:27:45] spiritual
[1:27:46] amenities
[1:27:49] not knowing our truth identification we
[1:27:52] only identified ourselves
[1:27:54] to the father and mother that born us to
[1:27:56] the to the to the to the tribe we were
[1:27:58] born in
[1:27:58] to the country that we were born in we
[1:28:00] were seeking this
[1:28:02] identification but we never knew of our
[1:28:04] truth identification
[1:28:06] there was something missing in our
[1:28:08] intelligence
[1:28:10] that there is no way we could have
[1:28:12] connected ourselves
[1:28:14] with god
[1:28:17] so we were all born that's that's what
[1:28:20] the natural birth
[1:28:21] put us in
[1:28:27] until you are born again and filled with
[1:28:29] the holy ghost
[1:28:30] you are still influenced
[1:28:33] that's why we have identity crisis
[1:28:37] that's how we have to i mean we we we
[1:28:40] got to measure ourselves with this
[1:28:41] person
[1:28:42] and measure ourselves with this other
[1:28:43] person that that's the struggle that is
[1:28:46] inside
[1:28:47] there's a loss of identity that we are
[1:28:49] looking for
[1:28:53] are we together
[1:29:00] he says what if you didn't know your
[1:29:04] name
[1:29:06] was what it was
[1:29:10] you come from a fine family which i hope
[1:29:13] you did
[1:29:15] if you come from a fine family
[1:29:18] of people and what if
[1:29:22] you forget that that family name
[1:29:26] and you go out here living disgracefully
[1:29:35] praise the lord
[1:29:40] what if you forget your family name
[1:29:44] and you you when you go out
[1:29:48] living disgraceful
[1:29:51] praise the lord i can i can identify to
[1:29:53] this personally
[1:29:55] uh very personally i can identify to
[1:29:57] have it would take me a lot of time to
[1:29:59] go into the story of that
[1:30:01] uh but i had to change my name
[1:30:07] praise the lord i'm not sure if you
[1:30:09] really know my real name
[1:30:13] but i was doing the wall i left home and
[1:30:15] i wanted to leave the country so
[1:30:17] i was trying i changed my name because
[1:30:19] uh
[1:30:20] uh because of of the figure of my father
[1:30:24] so i know i won't go into all the story
[1:30:26] but uh
[1:30:27] uh when when i got saved then
[1:30:30] you know then all the brothers i have to
[1:30:33] tell the church
[1:30:34] the name i told you people were not my
[1:30:36] name this is my name praise the lord
[1:30:39] amen so i can identify with this
[1:30:43] and uh uh if you come from a family
[1:30:47] of people and what if you forget that
[1:30:50] family name and just like i said
[1:30:53] you know you see people that you know
[1:30:56] that fight for their family name and and
[1:30:59] i mean it becomes so uh
[1:31:02] and some family names just make them so
[1:31:05] arrogant
[1:31:06] you know because they think uh they are
[1:31:08] from this family you know and they are
[1:31:10] from their family
[1:31:11] praise the lord if you just know that uh
[1:31:14] that family
[1:31:15] every every family name comes with with
[1:31:17] a spiritual amnesia
[1:31:19] praise the lord
[1:31:23] he says this is unto you
[1:31:27] and your name jones or whatever well
[1:31:31] i don't know see all right see
[1:31:35] that's a horrible thing to be a horrible
[1:31:38] condition
[1:31:39] to get in well that's just where the
[1:31:42] church has got
[1:31:45] it's supposed
[1:31:48] to be the representation of jesus
[1:31:53] amen revelation chapter 3 that was that
[1:31:56] was where the laodicea church
[1:31:58] you know was found when brother brandon
[1:32:00] preached his message he identified that
[1:32:03] you know to the laodicea uh uh
[1:32:06] you know age you know uh where the
[1:32:09] people
[1:32:10] uh uh you know naked blind and
[1:32:14] not even ignoring it they don't they
[1:32:15] don't even know you know what what is
[1:32:18] their their spiritual condition
[1:32:21] you know well that's just where the
[1:32:23] church has got is supposed
[1:32:25] to be a representation of jesus christ
[1:32:28] but
[1:32:28] if he forgot that because it got
[1:32:32] injected into a crease
[1:32:36] and and denomination and and that they
[1:32:40] have
[1:32:41] accepted that instead of the word
[1:32:45] and they are naked blind miserable and
[1:32:47] don't know
[1:32:48] it there's no way to tell them
[1:32:52] no way to tell them it's just like when
[1:32:54] we say all of these things
[1:32:56] you are with god in the beginning there
[1:32:59] is no way you
[1:33:00] in your a faith does not connect you
[1:33:03] with that
[1:33:04] there is no way you can connect yourself
[1:33:06] with that because there is no
[1:33:08] remembrance
[1:33:11] there is no remembrance
[1:33:17] praise the law there is no remembrance
[1:33:20] and you see and and that is the same
[1:33:22] thing on the other side
[1:33:24] when god deliver a person when a person
[1:33:27] has experienced
[1:33:28] total deliverance praise the lord
[1:33:32] god cuts away the connection
[1:33:37] he cuts that connection there is no way
[1:33:40] you can relate to it
[1:33:43] there is no way he takes the appetite
[1:33:48] he takes the very nature away
[1:33:56] praise the lord amen
[1:34:05] so you see that's the family name
[1:34:10] and that is the name that is worth
[1:34:14] standing for you know in the in
[1:34:17] in the church ages god commanded the
[1:34:19] church whenever there's two for his name
[1:34:24] amen whenever the church stood
[1:34:27] for god's name he commanded the church
[1:34:32] i will tell you also that name
[1:34:36] has a power of choice
[1:34:42] i mean a power of choice is in your name
[1:34:48] let's go to the book of hebrew yet a
[1:34:49] little bit
[1:34:54] let's go to the book of hebrew oh man
[1:34:58] praise the lord are we together
[1:35:18] glory be to god
[1:35:23] glory be to god
[1:35:29] the scripture speaks about moses here
[1:35:33] by faith moses amen in hebrew chapter 11
[1:35:39] verse 24 the bible says by faith moses
[1:35:42] when he was come two years
[1:35:45] refused to be called
[1:35:50] refused to be called he refused a name
[1:35:58] he refused a name
[1:36:02] he refused to be caught
[1:36:08] praise the lord
[1:36:15] it was not the day that moses refused to
[1:36:19] be called
[1:36:20] the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1:36:30] it was something that he's been
[1:36:34] feeding on his mind
[1:36:38] from all that his son school teacher
[1:36:42] jacob taught him
[1:36:46] his own armor praise the lord
[1:36:51] taught him that and he'd been feeding
[1:36:54] his mind
[1:36:55] with that
[1:36:59] he made a choice in his mind
[1:37:03] and that choice affected his attitude
[1:37:09] it was not the day he killed the the
[1:37:12] egyptian that he says
[1:37:13] now i refuse to become pharaoh no no no
[1:37:15] it was
[1:37:16] the choice that made him to do that
[1:37:20] because he has already refused to be an
[1:37:23] egyptian
[1:37:24] that's what pushed him out
[1:37:29] the choice of a neem affected his
[1:37:33] attitude
[1:37:34] that's the power of me
[1:37:42] praise the lord that's the power
[1:37:45] of name so you realize here
[1:37:48] that moses refused to be called
[1:37:52] an egyptian name make him to refuse
[1:37:56] to be pharaoh's daughter refuse to be
[1:37:59] the next
[1:38:00] pharaoh refused egypt as his motherland
[1:38:04] i mean when he refused that name there
[1:38:05] were a lot of things that he refused
[1:38:12] there were a lot of things that he
[1:38:14] refused
[1:38:16] he refused his opportunity
[1:38:25] these people that he was taking on your
[1:38:27] name were slaves
[1:38:30] he refused to be a ruler and choose to
[1:38:33] be slave
[1:38:36] that's the power of name
[1:38:44] praise the lord that's the power
[1:38:47] of name and yes yeah almighty god the
[1:38:51] creator
[1:38:52] of the universe taking on a human name
[1:38:56] and says i will name all my family in
[1:38:59] heaven
[1:39:01] all my family on earth
[1:39:04] will be named jesus
[1:39:08] the power of name
[1:39:11] my goodness
[1:39:14] if we just know the privilege we have
[1:39:17] to be called christians
[1:39:20] if we know how proud we should be
[1:39:26] to be called son and daughter of god
[1:39:30] hallelujah yes lord
[1:39:35] how proud we should live to represent
[1:39:37] the name by which we are called

[1:42:08] it will help and bring their picture out
[1:42:10] beautiful for us i have a few minutes
[1:42:12] here
[1:42:13] and then i will close
[1:42:17] proverbs chapter 30 pro
[1:42:20] solomon prayed this prayer
[1:42:24] verse seven two things have i acquired
[1:42:27] of thee
[1:42:28] deny me them that before i die
[1:42:32] he talks about remove far from me vanity
[1:42:35] and lies

[1:42:42] non-riches feed me with food
[1:42:46] convenient for me
[1:42:50] praise the lord fill me with food
[1:42:54] convenient for me
[1:42:58] lisa before and deny
[1:43:02] thee and say who is the lord
[1:43:06] praise the lord see all of our
[1:43:11] musicians all of these
[1:43:15] guys that has made names for themselves
[1:43:18] and
[1:43:19] money even the
[1:43:22] asset is still making money while they
[1:43:24] are gone ever pressley
[1:43:26] and all of these guys you know
[1:43:30] from a humble beginning all of them
[1:43:35] learn singing from a church
[1:43:40] but when money comes into it when wealth
[1:43:43] comes into it
[1:43:46] instead of being god's name their name
[1:43:48] goes
[1:43:49] on the wrecker that's what solomon
[1:43:53] is saying don't make me reach
[1:43:56] don't make me don't i shouldn't get to
[1:43:59] the place
[1:44:00] where i would think that i've achieved
[1:44:03] this by my effort
[1:44:10] praise the lord keeping to the place
[1:44:13] where i can trust you every day
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:23] elizabeth and deny thee and say who is

[1:44:34] these all hollywood stars
[1:44:39] one time the name of god was a treasure
[1:44:41] to them
[1:44:44] by god's grace i hope i can make it that
[1:44:46] was what every one of them said
[1:44:49] but when money gets in it and it gets in
[1:44:52] their head they have made a name for
[1:44:54] themselves
[1:44:54] they don't want to have anything to do
[1:44:56] with god
[1:45:04] praise the lord and he said who is the
[1:45:07] lord
[1:45:08] all leaves are be pulled and still
[1:45:11] whenever we steal we are taking god's
[1:45:13] name in vain because you are saying god
[1:45:15] cannot provide you are denying what god
[1:45:18] did for abraham
[1:45:26] and stealing goes far as converting
[1:45:29] something that is not for you
[1:45:31] instead of rejoicing in what someone
[1:45:33] else is have you just you just you just
[1:45:35] mad what is not you
[1:45:45] report and steal and take the name of my
[1:45:48] god in vain

[1:45:52] god's name in vain
[1:45:55] see where he attached a toe
[1:45:58] it's in the character of the believer
[1:46:02] it's in the character of the son of god
[1:46:04] or the daughter of god
[1:46:08] that practical son knew that if he's if
[1:46:10] he remains
[1:46:11] in the pig pen he will be taking his
[1:46:14] father's name
[1:46:14] in vain
[1:46:18] because his father was a king how can i
[1:46:21] bring
[1:46:22] the name of an elder so lord into a pig
[1:46:26] pen

[1:52:44] is wrong y'all want to kick me out do a
[1:52:46] blood transfusion
[1:52:48] but it's wrong praise the lord
[1:52:59] that's what brother branham said those
[1:53:00] men that wrote the bible were inspired
[1:53:02] of god
[1:53:03] because they were they were israelite
[1:53:05] they were jews
[1:53:06] but they were not ashamed when israel
[1:53:08] went astray they bring out the sin
[1:53:10] and publicize it to the people
[1:53:13] they were not taking sides because they
[1:53:14] were jews it was their people
[1:53:17] this is not a people gospel it's not a
[1:53:20] people church this is the church of the
[1:53:22] almighty god
[1:53:30] there's no name no name
[1:53:33] no me praise the lord
[1:53:38] man that's what i like to tell the devil
[1:53:40] i said satan there is no name
[1:53:43] no name not your name amen
[1:53:47] no name given among men whereby we can
[1:53:50] be
[1:53:50] saved except the name of god
[1:53:54] himself the name of god
[1:53:57] almighty god talk on that name to
[1:54:00] himself
[1:54:05] praise the lord let me show you this and
[1:54:08] tell you this
[1:54:10] jesus
[1:54:13] right there in the garden of gethsemane
[1:54:17] he was standing before his greater test
[1:54:22] praise the lord amen he was
[1:54:26] right before his greater test he was in
[1:54:29] the body
[1:54:30] he could cry and i believe those whips
[1:54:34] on his back in palace hall he cried
[1:54:38] if he could cry at the grave of lazar he
[1:54:41] cried
[1:54:42] because he was wearing a skin just like
[1:54:45] yours
[1:54:47] a mine
[1:54:52] he could feel
[1:54:57] praise the lord the tongues going down
[1:55:01] into his brow he could i mean he could
[1:55:03] feel the nails in his hands
[1:55:06] but even before that
[1:55:10] that was what he prayed he prayed
[1:55:14] why because the god that was performing
[1:55:17] the miracle
[1:55:18] turning the water to wine the god that
[1:55:20] was raised in lazarus
[1:55:22] was about to leave that body
[1:55:26] and that body was going to go like a man
[1:55:29] that's the reason why sometimes in our
[1:55:31] west trials
[1:55:33] we cry it's almost like we want to give
[1:55:36] up
[1:55:42] he says father not my will
[1:55:47] because the will of the flesh was there
[1:55:50] to just back up and say i can't do this
[1:55:52] no i can't do this
[1:55:55] i can't do this
[1:55:58] but he submitted himself that was what
[1:56:01] the father was proud of
[1:56:03] that was the thing that made god to name
[1:56:05] his family that name
[1:56:07] because he's talked to him not my will
[1:56:10] by your will lord
[1:56:13] i will not fail you this time i will not
[1:56:16] fail you right here
[1:56:20] and he stuck to it
[1:56:24] and god says i'm proud of my son i would
[1:56:27] take that name
[1:56:30] praise the lord he could have named the
[1:56:32] whole family moses
[1:56:34] but moses failed him
[1:56:37] he could have named the whole family in
[1:56:39] heaven joseph but joseph filled him
[1:56:41] joseph told a lie
[1:56:46] he so loved david he says i will give
[1:56:48] you a name
[1:56:51] he could have named the whole family in
[1:56:53] heaven and f david
[1:56:54] but there we feel him but when he came
[1:56:57] to this man
[1:57:00] when he came to this man christ
[1:57:03] he stuck to it
[1:57:06] he stuck to it
[1:57:09] and the father was so proud he says i
[1:57:12] will take this name to myself
[1:57:14] and i will name my family in heaven oh
[1:57:17] my goodness
[1:57:18] glory be to god
[1:57:29] whenever god gave you a trial he wants
[1:57:32] he want to associate his name to your
[1:57:36] name
[1:57:38] he want to associate his name to your
[1:57:41] name
[1:57:43] praise the lord
[1:57:48] amen even though you say we stay
[1:57:52] carrying
[1:57:53] our biological family name
[1:57:57] but by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:58:00] when we go down that water
[1:58:03] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:58:05] christ
[1:58:07] when we come out of that water god
[1:58:10] has associated his name oh that's what
[1:58:13] the devil hates you when you come
[1:58:14] out of baptism the battle begins
[1:58:18] he starts to blast your mind with all of
[1:58:19] the stupidness
[1:58:21] because he know you have taken on a name
[1:58:25] there the battle begins
[1:58:30] because you have taken on a name
[1:58:37] he knows the devil knows that more than
[1:58:39] many of us
[1:58:44] many of us because we come out of the
[1:58:46] water we still
[1:58:47] try to be proud of our family name we
[1:58:50] don't see what has happened
[1:58:53] that we have taken on a name
[1:58:58] are we together
[1:59:02] oh my goodness me
[1:59:06] may god help us amen
[1:59:09] may god help us when god
[1:59:12] associate his name to your name
[1:59:17] the devil will fight against it but if
[1:59:20] you would just stick there and say lord
[1:59:22] not my will
[1:59:24] for your will god will take that name
[1:59:28] from among the name of your friends from
[1:59:31] among the name of your associate
[1:59:33] and he will set that name up in a way
[1:59:37] in a supernatural way in a spiritual way
[1:59:43] in a spiritual way
[1:59:47] that is the thing that makes brother
[1:59:49] branham cry all the time
[1:59:51] when he thinks about god telling devi i
[1:59:53] took you from the sheep called
[1:59:55] he says nobody wanted to associate with
[1:59:57] random name
[1:59:59] because charles branham was a drunk
[2:00:03] he shot a man and he ran away nobody
[2:00:05] wanted to associate with that name
[2:00:09] he says but god associated his name
[2:00:17] with william branham
[2:00:22] that there is no nation around the world
[2:00:24] the people that people in that nation
[2:00:27] has not heard about the name william
[2:00:29] branham
[2:00:30] god has associated his name with billy
[2:00:33] graham
[2:00:36] better grant was just a follower of an
[2:00:39] evangelist that was on the field
[2:00:44] and that evangelist got so troubled in
[2:00:46] his mind
[2:00:48] with the holocaust story and all of that
[2:00:51] and he throw his bible down
[2:00:52] says how can we be reading about a god
[2:00:54] of a jews and he allowed them to suffer
[2:00:57] in the hands
[2:00:58] of hitler he threw his bible down
[2:01:02] and young billy graham was so troubled
[2:01:04] in his mind
[2:01:06] what he was going to do he called his
[2:01:08] mama back home
[2:01:12] but he took a decision
[2:01:15] to stick with god's name
[2:01:20] and god associated his name with billy
[2:01:22] graham
[2:01:24] and that name is known around the world
[2:01:30] his father was not a president
[2:01:33] brother branham dad was not a president
[2:01:34] he was not a world leader
[2:01:38] but because he make a choice
[2:01:42] he make a choice
[2:01:45] and god comes behind it
[2:01:48] and associate himself with thy name
[2:01:57] and god gave us a privilege you will
[2:01:58] continue musicians you can come
[2:02:20] but i'll tell you a real man the weight
[2:02:23] of a true prophet

[2:05:11] doctrines run in the country we have
[2:05:13] seen that
[2:05:15] people change change their family name
[2:05:17] and
[2:05:18] and and now they become uh moses branham
[2:05:21] and peter branham
[2:05:22] just thinking about taking on brother
[2:05:24] branham i mean it would give you favor
[2:05:25] with god that's not
[2:05:26] eight respecting brother branham message
[2:05:31] respecting the word of god that's why i
[2:05:33] gave you favor with god
[2:05:36] it's not changing your parents name and
[2:05:38] taking willem branham name
[2:05:40] god identified himself with that name
[2:05:43] because william browner make a choice to
[2:05:45] stay with god's word
[2:05:48] that's what brought god to that name
[2:06:02] if my father was a drunkard or my father
[2:06:05] i would be so glad to know that god
[2:06:08] has associated himself with the name
[2:06:11] of a man that nobody knew his name
[2:06:17] because it please god to bring me
[2:06:19] through him
[2:06:21] and now i commit my life to god
