morning we started the subject last week the children had come to the birth and there is no strength we want to continue in that thought this morning but we would take genesis chapter 35 we will read a little bit about our mother uh richard you know what rachel's experience at birth bringing forth benjamin became a prophecy even when jesus was born israel in egypt rachel weeping for her children so let's let's take genesis chapter 35 this morning amen the children i come to the birth and there is no strength praise the lord amen we we spoke about that isaiah chapter 37 verse 3. that was where the hezekiah sent a message to isaiah and described the situation that israel was in because three things was facing them there was trouble the the assyrians were upon them it was a rebuke to them because of their scene and it was a blasphemy because they were challenging the lord god almighty amen amen praise the lord and that's one thing that god would not want you to do amen amen he does not have a challenger amen he does not have a challenger praise the law so uh genesis chapter 35 let's read from verse 15 and genesis 35 let's read from verse 15 praise the lord amen 35 from verse 15 and jacob called the name of the place where god speak to with him belter and the joining from bether and did joining from belton and there was but a little way to come to ephrata and richard travel and she had high labor and it came to pass when she was in high labor that the midwife said unto her fear net for thou shall have this son also and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called the name but called his name ben noni but his father called him benjamin and rachel died and was buried in the way of ephrata which is bethlehem praise the lord let's pray together heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus we just we just want to pray lord we realize that lord father this that we have just read became so significant that jeremiah after hundreds of years prophesied and said richard weeping for her children and father when our lord jesus was born the prophecy was also echo father lord because of the slaughter of all of those babies all garden and what a time that we are living in father lord we're spiritually young people are being killed on the altar of negligence father we would just pray this morning that the holy ghost would come come and help us lord come father take your word now lord jesus be the preacher this morning come out of the pages of the bible move to the hearts of your children lord we want to thank you father oh god and we pray for many that are streaming in this morning that your grace law father will also bless them in their home we love you and we appreciate you lord in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you first john chapter 2 while you take your seat we will read first john chapter 2 praise the lord first john chapter 2 glory be to god amen amen let's read verse 13 and verse 14 john first john chapter 2 verse 12 i write unto you little children because your sin are forgiving you for his name's sake can we say amen to them amen young people you have to claim these promises amen they are written because of you hallelujah amen verse 13 i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning and who is him the word the logos amen in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word is god so john is saying here right unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young man because ye have overcome the weaker one can we say amen today praise the lord we're not relying on our abilities we are relying on what jesus have already done amen praise the lord he's the victory he's the one that have overcome praise the lord amen so uh you have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have known the father verse 14 i write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you i've written unto you young men because ye are strong amen what a love that the father has loved us that we can be called the children of god praise the lord we have to know that everything that we need for this joining is already provided in the word of god praise the lord no one should carry you on on on on pennies uh uh you know uh uh uh or give you some kind of uh uh uh you know religious application uh obligation believing that you will be able to produce it god has already provided right amen we have to identify we have to accept it and we have to walk in it by faith i've read it unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abireth in you that's where your strength comes from your strength comes from this word that is abiding in you jesus said if yield a body meaning my word abiding you you can ask whatever you will and the father is going to put it on your life amen just like haiti write you can say the right thing and ask for whatever you want the father is going to put it right on your lap praise the lord amen i read it unto you young man because ye are strong can the word of god about it in you and ye have overcome the wicked one praise the lord amen he uh he identified your strength amen amen he identified how you have overcome praise the lord you have overcome by your strength what is your strength the word that abideth in you praise the lord amen are we together amen first john chapter 4 verse 4 amen this is a familiar one yeah of god little children praise the lord and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the word amen praise the lord you believe that this morning that greater is he that is in you don't look at what the devil is doing to your flesh don't look at what he's pumping on your mind believe that word that is in you amen amen amen that word that you have received of christ so this morning we want to talk about the children that come to the birth now you have to remember we said last week we were not talking about the mothers we're not talking about the mothers we were talking about the children you know because by nature god designed it that when that child has grown to maturity in the womb whether whether it's a chick in the head whether it's a baby in a warm the food that if that they have been fed on and then the right atmosphere and the right exercise and the right treatment will give that child such a strength at the time of birth amen and life is going to come forth praise the lord so the children i come to the birth amen amen and so we we won't look at yet our mother rachel amen uh uh the scripture says here uh this is uh genesis chapter 35 was word jacob has has met the angel amen you go back to verse one he had met the angel or the angel met him one of the two but there was a meeting that went on praise the lord whether he met the angel or the angel met him there was a meeting that went on and he did not walk the scene praise the lord so it will be the same whether you meet god or god meets you you can never be the same after that meeting praise the lord amen so jacob have just met the angel and the angel you know has has uh has ministered to him and and uh and then he was he was living there now and uh and you know and on his way now right in that time uh richard was close to giving birth but i want to bring your attention to something here that i want to that i want to slide into this genesis chapter 10 to 1. let's go back a little bit amen genesis chapter 10 one let's go back if you familiar with my preaching you will know that i love my bible amen amen i love to read this bible amen and i'm sure you do the same amen genesis chapter 10 1 will bring us to a story here where jacob was about leaving his father-in-law's house lobby after he had worked he have you know uh give raise his family and uh and he have gotten some wealth god started to deal with him because he was seeing that things were changing one time he was loved by leban but now and things are beginning to change and the lord told him to get away and so he was afraid of lobbying and then he decided to steal himself away which means he decided to sneak with his family out of the house but something happened right in that time let's follow a little bit here verse uh 19 let's start from verse 19 and lobby went to share his sheep and richard has stolen the images that were her father's now let's put the story into context jacob having the feeling to leave and god dealing with his heart he put he set his wife down and he told them he said see what is happening and i'm losing favor with your dad and uh and we have to get and and i have to get out of here the lord god has spoken to me and all of that he said and and and in the in the in the scripture his wife said uh i mean we don't even have anything we don't have no inheritance of our father he have even saw us and he have not even given us any benefit praise the lord so if you keep that in context you will now understand why richard had to take her father images now these images it is not in the context of a false god nor because the lord god spoke to lobbying that very same night these images is more in a sense that loving was a businessman perhaps and then he bought you know he bought images that worth money because she was taking it away not as a god to worship but she was taken away as as an inheritance maybe to sell along the way so she can she can feel like i've got something from my father's house are we together amen amen i mean if if if laban would run after uh after jacob you know for those images then which means the wolf they were very expensive and they were very meaningful to him that's right are we together amen now so richard she stole her father images and as the story would go on let's drop down to verse 30. but one thing you want we want to keep in our mind here is that jacob never knew about it amen she never told jacob about it that's there's a that's a flashing red light that's a bad sign right amen right because when akam stole the babylonian gaming he never told his wife about it he never told his children about it but when god was about to deal with icon it cost him his entire family are we together amen verse teddy and now this is uh uh 11 speaking to jacob he have ran after jacob verse 26 you will see it in 11 said unto jacob what have that done and he went on and said all of this verse 30. and now though thou will that need be gone because they are so longer after their father's house yet wherefore have thou stolen my gods praise the lord amen now and jacob answered and said to levin because i was afraid for i said periventure thou who they take by false that daughters from me with whomsoever thou founded thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern doubt what is done with me and uh and take it today for jacob knew net that richard has stolen them now i want us to to underline that verse 32 because we will come back to it now today [Music] now jacob now knowing that rachel has taken this he said with womb you find your gods let that person die praise the lord amen now you have to realize that god was dealing with this man though he had trouble along the way though he stole the blessing though he he he you know he he cheated on the sheeps and all of that but god was dealing with this man praise the lord amen amen amen and and and he said that out of an earnest heart because as far as he's concerned there is nothing like that under his roof as far as he concerned his wife would have told him if she knew anything about it and then you can read the rest of the story the bible went on and she's uh you know and and and and and a lot of them went into jacobs 10 and into leo stan and you know now rachel has has taken the images and put them you know uh in in the camden furniture and sat upon them you know and she told her father you know i can't move because you know uh this time of a woman is upon me i please don't don't don't make me to wake up and he checked every word and he didn't add he didn't he didn't see the image so he believed going away that jacob did not hide his his images or his gods and then uh uh all along the journey you know i mean the the bible uh give us this account and you know and never give us the rest of the story praise the lord the rest of the story in the fact of whether rachel ever told jacob what was going on with with those images that she talking in one of you because you have to realize that right after that jacob and leban went into a coveted you know he just let the lobby between me and they and uh and they made a covet in there but this is this is where i'm coming to with this whole thing jacob has just said if there is one that have taken this praise the lord amen let that one die least did he know he had just spoken the word concerning his wife jephthah went to a battle georges chapter 11 and the lord he sucked the face of the lord and he said lord you know i've been estranged from my brothers rejected but now they have come to me that i should fight for them lord if you give me the victory the first thing that ran out of my house i would sacrifice sacrificed little did he know it was going to be his only daughter praise the lord when you're dealing with god you don't play with words because god is worth himself amen praise the lord amen amen and uh just like brother branham said in the church ages we we learn to encourage ourselves in the things that are right and discourage the things that are wrong you know we we we saw the uh as chapter five what happened to ananias and so far you know so it's it's all through the bible you know it's all through the bible you cannot outsmart god praise the lord you can ask my god and and especially when you come on the under the marriage covenant and you expect your god to bless your home you know and all of that we have to be transparent with one another praise the lord amen because one thing that uh one one one one thing one mistake that you may you know uh uh see also that is written in the bible you know if if if if if a child is living in a father's house which is a girl and then she goes out and make a vow and all of that if the father don't know about it he has the right to ignore that vow why because she's he she's honored his hair shape and she must not go out and just do things without consulting him also the woman that's what the scripture says if the woman goes out and make a vow to the temple you know we will build you a new temple we will break this altar down and she did not tell her husband and the husband gets to know about it he has the right to ignore that praise the lord now the reason of that is because the marriage coveted and the family coveting is a covenant of protection it's a covenant of protection praise the lord are we together amen and i mean we can going on we can go on and on you know with uh with uh with with different examples but i'm trying just to set a scene here you know uh uh uh to create a picture here and uh in our mind you know because i don't believe that that uh that jose i mean jacob and rachel was even looking up to this see her sister leah is the older sister and leah has had had more children than richard hi praise the lord amen amen now i'm not i'm not giving you scriptural interpretation because it's not my place it's a prophet place to interpret scripture but i'm just trying to create a picture amen praise the lord mean that i mean as as christian we don't play with words that's what the strip just said let your yeah be yet and your nade name we have to be truthful we have to be we have to be transparent we have to get one another involved like i've said and i've always said i've always believed this you're having all of these independent believers you know that live their independent lives you know they are not questionable to anybody they get their revelation praise the lord but yet with their independent life they want to be part of a body it does not work like that that's right it does not work like that no matter where you come from and what you know if you if you are part of this body you must be subject to what this local church believes if you don't agree with it our doors are open for you to come and visit you know we love those long-term visitors we don't forget about them so easily but it's a body when you live together as a family you cannot be independent in the family jesus said if you're not gathering you are scattering amen think about you know in the feeling and people are gathering apples and this guy is not working but he's the one talking it's going to be less work because he's just distracting people that are working he has all the storage you know when i used to be to this place and this this person is trying to do some work and they're looking at him look at me let me let me show you this but you think about it if every hands is at work and you are and you are telling story that we can live and we are all working the world go more faster than when you fall your hands and stand on the banks you want to be giving instruction but you don't want to touch what is what is being done it don't work like that family unit don't work like that church don't work like that marriages don't work like that praise the lord what am i preaching on this morning what is taking me down this trail amen glory be to god but here he said something has been sold in this home and jacob trying to be truthful and trying to be transparent to his father-in-law he says it would have been better for him to say i don't know about it i never took your images i don't know about it but he been so convinced that he know of his household he know of his house he know his that he know the things his children are doing he know the things his wife are doing because they communicate he says if you find this let the person die now you have to know that lebanon didn't find it but god knows who took it amen you can hide it and make all the excuses that we will never know but there is a sovereign god that you are dealing with praise the lord amen amen well whoever pulling me down that road you just take your break a little bit because i have a message here to preach amen amen so we come to genesis 35 verse 15. and jacob gets to this place after he have met the angel let's just deal with some few things here and jacob called the name of the place where god speak with him bether and we all know the alpha means the house of god amen it means the house of god uh an an ancient place and seat of worship in ephraim on the border of benjamin belther means the house of god are we together amen and the bible says year verse 16 and they're joining from belter and there was bought a little ways to come to ephrata amen so they were just between belter and e frother now that that is the region that that is that is that was now called beth to him that region between belton and ephrata but before it was buffed to him so uh they were in this journey just a little way to get to ephrata and and and and rachel birth pain came on her i mean now i was looking at the word ephrata just like we look at belter an ephrata means a heap of arches an arch heap praise the lord amen it means also a place of fruitfulness now how can a place of arches become a place of fruitfulness well that's the reason why the burns farm when the trees are cut down that's what the brain found because the trees when they are burned the arches now become fertilizer to make them feel truthful praise the lord amen amen because there is fruitfulness in arches glory be to god amen oh my goodness amen i feel like there is not enough room here for me to preach i might run through this wall amen when i look at that last night what i was telling and saw that ephrata means an arch heap i could not help but think about job glory be to god oh my amen let's read this god seven job let's read this a little bit notice what happened then then he broke out in balls and set out on the arch heap out there stripping himself with a croc or something his wife comes to the door all his friends were gone three church members came down turned their back on him for seven days wouldn't even speak to him accuse him of being a secret sinner not not much consolation from the church then amen the church has failed no consolation from the church i mean people go to church they just go i mean i mean you don't get the comfort that you should be able to get because the oil is in christ now secret sinner listen job knew in his heart that he wasn't a secret sinner he did confess his sin upon the base of the sheer blood and he knew that god was on an obligation to meet him on the basis of death and we say amen now so the thing yet is that job where job got the arches from to pull over himself was the very same place where he was making sacrifice for his children the scripture make us to know that job makes sacrifice every year whether it was an wallet whether it was monthly he made sacrifice and burn offering for his children and said perhaps maybe my children are wrong or maybe my children is doing this and he made sacrifice to that place until it became a heap of arches could that be the very same place that rachel died you think about it i'm going i'm going to go on and preach now so uh job came down to that very same place identifying himself with his sacrifice because he knew he was doing what was right in the sight of god making sacrifices for his children was not wrong now you ever see his children had died and his body is all broken up above he comes right on their ash heap and take the very same arches from his sacrifice and he pull it over him what a way to identify with your sacrifice oh glory be to god amen hallelujah yes sir amen and and and and and he fractured means a place of fruitfulness amen a place of arches is fruitfulness isaiah chapter 61 verse 3 god promised that he would give beauty for arches praise the lord so in the midst of arches in the midst of chaos god is able to bring out something beautiful amen praise the lord in the midst of your arches he's able to bring something beautiful one of these days when this mortal body is gone and they have turned to dust god is going to bring an incorruptible body out of the dust amen he gave beauty for our chase but let's travel on there because we are running out of time amen time is not our friend but we see this this this becomes very important this becomes very prophetic it becomes very prophetic it becomes a place of the resurrection oh my goodness amen in front of the heap of arches a place of fruitfulness praise the lord amen and richer the name rachel means you a female sheep amen so you just think about it now we are building something here a female sheep that is a type of the church because the church is a female praise the lord amen she's leaving the house of god and coming to this place remember jesus said until the sea goes to the ground and die right amen amen until the sea goes to the ground and died and became and become arches it cannot bring forth again praise the lord amen so the church left his glory at pentecost and it went down to the field of arches under the roman persecution praise the lord amen amen the roman power that fought of iron and clay got upon the church and starts to ground the church to arches burn them out of stake and crucify them but god was going to bring a beautiful thing out of there oh my goodness praise the lord amen amen amen oh my my mind praise the lord you know i enjoy preaching to myself because i can preach whatever i want to preach amen i don't have to be careful of what you think about it glory be to god amen now so retro means a a female sheep yo and uh and uh and and right here we see here that uh uh uh the scripture uh the fraternal and richard in travel now you you look at that also yeah we we will get to that yeah amen then the bible says and it came to pass when she was in high level the middle wife said unto her fear net thou shall have this son praise the lord amen the male wife could see that her body was becoming weak but the child was ready to come out praise the lord amen amen and it came to pass now brother branham taught us that the the patriots the hebrew mother when they were giving birth amen so this is a perfect sign when they were giving birth they they slam they make an expression she cried out all the child of my sorrow she called him benjamin the child of my sorrow son of my sorrow that what it means praise the lord isaiah 53 verse 3 the bible says jesus will be the man of sorrow amen so you can see why when jesus was bombed this prophecy was repeated richer weeping for her children and every child of god you are born under this promise that's the reason why you have sorrow in your days you have sorrow in your life because sorrow is the secret place where god brings your changes where he changes your arches to beauty is in your sorrow she cried out the son of my sorrow and the bible says that was her last breath lord be to god amen saint john chapter 16 the bible says a woman when she's in travail have sorrow the church goes through sorrow people said nothing happened in the seaside they had they say everything whatever they want to say about the church thinking that is on the ability of a man for something to happen in the church no god did not put his promises on the ability of a man god is more than ever to do what he want to do praise the lord that's the reason why when those jews went through the gas chamber almighty god was sitting on his throne because he knew he had everything in control he knew that it would take the arches of those jews that was burned in the gas chamber to bring a glorious build uh uh israel a beautiful israel and return his people back to his word amen praise the lord amen we're just laying some foundations down here is climbing her birth pain all the sun of my sorrow and the bible says that was her last breath her soul left away from her body and when they called jacob he wept he wept and he picked up the little baby and said you are the son of my right hand from the son of sorrow to the son of the right hand glory be to god amen oh my god are you sure you're ready for me to preach amen amen that's the joining of the church that's the joining of every child of god it's from the son of sorrow to the son of the right hand you can never get to the right hand until you go through the house of credit praise the lord amen the children i come to the birth and there is no strength glory be to god amen amen many men see a lot of prophecies it's just it's just tied right into days amen i'm just trying to skip like a lamb here amen and just and just get to the get to the point here but they are just they are just a lot of things that i just tie right into this amen amen praise the lord amen hallelujah amen amen and and that's that's the way god is you know he gave us bit in pieces of his internal thoughts because his thoughts is internal that's right amen you know he he just slide him in on the types in shadow praise the lord amen and i was studying and i i saw this uh you know uh uh if right had a uh on an ash heap and i said you know and and the prophet of god talked about an achievement that's what that's where abraham i mean job sat down in his days of sorrow praise the lord it was on that very same ash heat brother branham i read the last name where he says and and when and when god brought that vision and job saw the resurrection from the same ash heap he exclaimed i know my redeemer levitt he was sitting on the ash heap his days of trouble was now over but god met him in that same situation gave him a vision of the resurrection praise the lord amen from arches to beauty from arches to fruitfulness from the son of sorrow to the son of the right hand glory be to god amen amen amen amen amen what almighty god we have here man oh praise the lord amen what a mighty god we serve amen i just i just feel like dancing a little bit amen amen amen praise the lord hallelujah but i can't trust you when we start dancing you might just dance the rest of the service so let's keep the dance for the rest for the end of the service praise the lord i know some dancers in this place when they get their dancing shoes on it's hard to take it off praise the lord amen but you see what is what we're talking about here church we we we are dealing with prophecy we are dealing with uh uh a prophecy where god head under the shadows things that concern you and myself that concern our walk are we together amen you know what it looks like you know uh uh we have out of these evangelists that tells the people just give your life to jesus and everything will be fine if they could only tell them give your life to jesus and he will bring you to a chase before you see any glory and any beauty in christianity you have to get to arches they gave them all of these line hopes so the people go to church and they expect that as soon as they get a church they will they will find a husband they would get married they would buy the house you know they would get a better job and all of these things run through their mind and when god starts dealing with their lives with little trials then they say the church feel me the church is the potter's house when you come to church this is the porter's house this is where he breaks you and he crushes you and then he remake you this is the potter's house [Music] that's that's what the church is amen it's a breaking place praise the lord amen some habits are so strong to break [Music] some people so tough in their minds amen they are so attached to their natural identity that is hard to take them from that you know this thing wrong in our family that that's how our family is you know this thing is in our family you know it's our family problem is our family weakness but give it to god he's going to change your life around he's going to turn you around he will make you a new person amen oh my young people this is your season amen this is your season praise the lord because i i

field of access because he want to make a new person out of you amen he got to bring you to the field of arches praise the lord amen glory be to god he will take you from the son of sorrow and you

birth when jacob was blessing them he never missed the mark when joshua was placing them in the promise he never missed the mark because that's how divine inspiration works it's not a guessing show
