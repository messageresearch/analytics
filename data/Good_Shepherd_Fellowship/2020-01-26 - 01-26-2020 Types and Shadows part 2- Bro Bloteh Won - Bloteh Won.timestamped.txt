[53:29] archive not always on video but

[54:40] [Applause]
[54:56] good to have you be sitting with us god
[54:59] bless you god bless you
[55:04] praise Lord we want to thank a lot for
[55:10] for that Thank You musicians that will
[55:15] be all for the music who do the rest at
[55:17] the end of the service we want to thank
[55:20] the Lord for for all of those
[55:22] development the brothers being working
[55:25] tirelessly I mean they've been putting
[55:28] every time into a to get this thing up
[55:31] brother Andrews brother Jordan and every
[55:36] one of them back there sister faith I
[55:38] mean every one of them being kind of for
[55:41] working to have this thing going
[55:43] at first when I was approached with this
[55:47] whole thing of the internet I was not
[55:49] too comfortable with it and but then
[55:54] there was a brother that visited with us
[55:56] here and then he was I mean after the
[56:00] service he came to me in an Axman in
[56:02] says he said bruh won't you you people
[56:04] had a website I said well no we've been
[56:07] talking about it but we have met we are
[56:10] not really gone in their direction yet
[56:12] it's a world I think it would be a good
[56:14] thing for you people to do because and
[56:18] we talked about it you know I give him
[56:20] an mine you know a little little of my
[56:22] view of what I was trying to to stay
[56:26] away from and because I know they're
[56:30] they have very negative way that people
[56:33] try to approach these things but then
[56:36] his view was more of an outreach you
[56:43] know it was a more of an outreach
[56:46] anything that we can you can give the
[56:51] side to somebody or send somebody on the
[56:54] YouTube channel and then maybe the Lord
[56:59] will kind of touch the heart or they
[57:02] could enjoy the service or they could
[57:04] learn something from what has been
[57:07] shared so looking at the place for from
[57:09] from the area of an outreach that is
[57:13] that is the basis of why we are doing
[57:17] this also we know there are some of the
[57:21] the Saints that live far and especially
[57:24] this time of the year during the winter
[57:26] it's a little bit tough for them to be
[57:29] able to make it a service with distance
[57:31] some of them make a lot of sacrifices
[57:33] snow rain sound shine here they come but
[57:38] also for those people they can be able
[57:41] to be part of the service be if the
[57:44] weather stop them from coming and we
[57:47] also have a big you know a group of us
[57:51] that stay have now found that perfect
[57:54] schedule for work and they can also be
[57:56] able to make use of the service if they
[58:00] are able to do it you know at that time
[58:07] of the day so that that is one of the
[58:09] thing behind year you know the purpose
[58:14] is net really to help you stay away from
[58:17] church and follow the service in your
[58:20] bed
[58:21] praise the Lord amen
[58:25] so but we want to thank all the brothers
[58:28] and we know they stay a work-in-progress
[58:30] you know a stated work in progress we
[58:33] will appreciate constructive criticism
[58:37] you know you know if you want to
[58:39] criticize those criticize us to be
[58:41] better
[58:42] don't criticize us because you are but
[58:44] you are better praise the Lord
[58:47] and so those reason why we work as time
[58:56] goes by they will bring you more updates
[58:58] and I mean it's of a big help you know
[59:05] we will not we will never forget our
[59:08] friend and brother but Lord it was all
[59:11] behind I was doing this you know many
[59:13] years ago it's just that I just thought
[59:17] how we were not at the right place to
[59:19] start there but we want to thank God and
[59:22] believing that his grace is sufficient
[59:25] and that grace will be able to take us
[59:28] true amen
[59:29] Wednesday night I was speaking a little
[59:31] bit on types in shadow and and and the
[59:35] reason why I was talking on type and
[59:39] shadow is because it's a keystone in the
[59:43] Bible types and shadow is a keystone in
[59:46] the Bible because the things from the
[59:49] Old Testament are reflected in the New
[59:51] Testament
[59:51] and it makes it easy as believers today
[59:55] for us to be able to approach the
[59:58] subject and we can see what God did in
[1:00:00] the Old Testament down to the New
[1:00:02] Testament and what he want to do today
[1:00:05] in our lives so looking at all of the
[1:00:09] earth another thing that was on my mind
[1:00:12] that I've been thinking about long was
[1:00:16] to talk a little bit around the Elijah
[1:00:20] ministry you know to talk about the
[1:00:23] Elijah ministry all of those things were
[1:00:26] kind of a run into our types in shadow
[1:00:29] and but you know as as we as we have
[1:00:35] believers you know we we talk about you
[1:00:40] know Malachi for promise we talk about
[1:00:46] you know the prophet Elijah but I was I
[1:00:50] was studying and I will tell you that
[1:00:52] now a real was net I did I never thought
[1:00:56] that I had all mind you know my
[1:00:59] resources together to be able to
[1:01:01] approach it this morning but something
[1:01:04] just confirmed it to my heart yesterday
[1:01:06] and and what actually it was I was here
[1:01:09] sometime in the evening and like I would
[1:01:11] do you know once in awhile and you know
[1:01:13] you think about people and then you try
[1:01:15] to check on them you try to encourage
[1:01:17] them there was a young sister that was
[1:01:20] here then brother Ariel you know
[1:01:24] encouraged her she started coming to
[1:01:26] church with us and and she was an
[1:01:29] international student you know don't go
[1:01:33] down with her
[1:01:35] studies and she had moved to Texas so
[1:01:41] once in a while you know I would kind of
[1:01:44] talk to her see how she's doing you find
[1:01:47] a church to go to have you found work
[1:01:49] you know and and moreover you know she
[1:01:57] and her fiance they planning to do their
[1:01:59] wedding he came one time from Canada and
[1:02:02] visited with us here so I mean they kind
[1:02:07] of encouraged us if there is any way
[1:02:11] that we can be able to you know
[1:02:13] encourage them be there are things that
[1:02:15] we can be able to talk to them that
[1:02:17] would be helpful in a sign in a sense of
[1:02:20] some counsel so I had privilege to talk
[1:02:24] with her there back in the Congo and you
[1:02:29] know in order there so I just thought
[1:02:31] about her loss and that's why I don't
[1:02:32] know if she's if she has settled down a
[1:02:35] little bit and after we talk about
[1:02:37] different things work in church and all
[1:02:39] of that so accesses well what have you
[1:02:43] been reading what is your devotion what
[1:02:47] have you been reading she says well I
[1:02:50] just been reading over in the book of
[1:02:52] James
[1:02:52] I said yeah what is that you can you
[1:02:56] share a little bit with me so I've been
[1:02:58] reading about you know how Elijah prayed
[1:03:02] that there should be no rain you know
[1:03:05] for three I don't know what it was three
[1:03:08] and a half years or three years you know
[1:03:10] she was just trying to and I kind of
[1:03:12] forgot her off God so I could see her
[1:03:15] shaking a little bit but I just wanted
[1:03:17] to start a conversation you know and
[1:03:20] just encourage her you know pretty soon
[1:03:22] I will find out whether she was really
[1:03:23] know whether she was not so and so I
[1:03:29] actually bought one layer to read there
[1:03:32] you know what what did you got out of
[1:03:34] the actress's well you know I what I got
[1:03:36] out of it was to see that you know
[1:03:40] sometimes I limit God in my prayer you
[1:03:44] know I'm afraid to ask for some things
[1:03:47] you know but to see that a man can ask
[1:03:50] God you know that there should be no
[1:03:53] ring and and God who granted then I
[1:03:58] think you know there was nothing we can
[1:04:00] ask the Lord you know if it's the right
[1:04:03] thing
[1:04:04] so we started talking from one thing to
[1:04:07] another and I appreciate that and the
[1:04:09] anything about it there is that there
[1:04:11] was the scripture that was sitting right
[1:04:13] before me I was studying about James I
[1:04:18] was comparing it to two first King I was
[1:04:20] just looking at the the whole Elisha
[1:04:23] what actually I was looking at was
[1:04:26] brother Branham said there was seven
[1:04:29] Church edges Israel has seven Church
[1:04:31] edges just like the Gentile has seven
[1:04:34] Church edges so I was looking at from
[1:04:37] Solomon to Elisha some of the things
[1:04:40] that were happening though so some other
[1:04:42] things we'll go through this morning I
[1:04:43] would try to run through it and but I
[1:04:46] was looking at first Kings chapter 17
[1:04:51] just put Elijah right before us the very
[1:04:55] first verse speaks about Elijah the
[1:04:59] Tishbite
[1:04:59] a man of Ginley and he comes on the
[1:05:05] scene and ever even tell us nothing else
[1:05:08] and it just he comes on the scene he
[1:05:10] bring a word to a hub he said they will
[1:05:12] not be rain or Dew you until I cover it
[1:05:17] praise the Lord now why would God you
[1:05:24] know why would the scripture give us
[1:05:26] such an introduction of a man like that
[1:05:28] what was happening what was happening
[1:05:33] now as we talk about types and shadow if
[1:05:37] if the law can be able to help us to be
[1:05:40] able to set a scene for us to see what
[1:05:43] was happening in that time then we will
[1:05:47] be able to appreciate our Elijah
[1:05:50] ministry praise the Lord
[1:05:55] amen we will be able to appreciate why
[1:06:01] we have to you know stay with the
[1:06:07] message of the hour praise the Lord
[1:06:11] amen so then after we got through
[1:06:16] talking I was I wanted to wrap up
[1:06:18] because I want to do just I didn't want
[1:06:20] to lose my my talk but I just said to
[1:06:24] myself well I did not plan for this
[1:06:27] conversation this just sound like what
[1:06:29] I'm going to speak about tomorrow
[1:06:32] so I started preaching to her a little
[1:06:34] bit as I might be talking on this
[1:06:36] tomorrow so let me give you a little bit
[1:06:40] but there is one thing I would say this
[1:06:42] morning you know all the churches we
[1:06:45] talked about the double portion of
[1:06:47] Elijah we want to go in a rapture like
[1:06:51] Elijah we want to be able to smoke the
[1:06:56] water split things we want to be able to
[1:06:59] defy Kings defied Authority but I will
[1:07:02] tell you this morning right in the book
[1:07:05] of James the Bible lay out a foundation
[1:07:10] it laid out something very very
[1:07:12] important the Bible says Elijah was a
[1:07:18] man of like passion just like we are he
[1:07:22] had all of his struggles he half years
[1:07:25] he had doubts because he was a man of
[1:07:30] like passion but another thing the
[1:07:33] scripture says that is very very very
[1:07:35] very important if you don't hear nothing
[1:07:41] from me this morning don't let this one
[1:07:42] pass from you the Bible say he prayed
[1:07:45] earnestly underline their word earnestly
[1:07:52] that was the beginning sucess of
[1:07:56] Elijah's ministry amen
[1:08:03] there was the beginning sauce that there
[1:08:05] is two things there now
[1:08:08] you think about it think about it before
[1:08:11] we read the scripture this morning you
[1:08:13] think about it the Bible says he prayed
[1:08:17] that there should be Noreen now watch
[1:08:23] the scene now don't miss it
[1:08:25] Elijah never went to a hub and told a
[1:08:29] hub there will be no rain until I call
[1:08:32] for it before he went to pray know he
[1:08:36] pray and he was convinced he knew where
[1:08:40] he was standing when he approached that
[1:08:43] King and said there will be no rain or
[1:08:47] Dew you until I praise the Lord are we
[1:08:58] together so the work was already done
[1:09:02] and the scripture gave us a reason why
[1:09:06] why he had to do that what we're talking
[1:09:12] about here we're talking about a drought
[1:09:13] we're talking about all the rivers will
[1:09:17] go dry you know all the lakes there will
[1:09:20] be no water that the farmers will not be
[1:09:23] successful to plant anything in those
[1:09:25] three and a half years praise the Lord
[1:09:34] as we study the subject you will even
[1:09:37] realize that the drought even started
[1:09:41] before Elijah came on the scene because
[1:09:45] he have already prayed he asked God law
[1:09:50] shut up the heavens before he even came
[1:09:55] to a hub he have already prayed if you
[1:10:00] look through the scripture which of
[1:10:01] course I would bring it out so we can be
[1:10:03] able to see it in larger came after six
[1:10:07] months of drought and
[1:10:14] he's announcing so yeah I'm the
[1:10:19] responsive that now if you watch the
[1:10:20] scripture that that is the reason why
[1:10:22] they have accusing you are the one that
[1:10:24] is troubling Israel you either want to
[1:10:27] have done they stink
[1:10:29] you say no I'm not a one
[1:10:32] you and your father house how are we
[1:10:39] together but I want to go back and say
[1:10:42] if we cannot be earnest there is no word
[1:10:49] you can go with God if we cannot be
[1:10:58] earnest earnest with our very self
[1:11:04] we can play religion we can play message
[1:11:08] we can play whatever we want to play if
[1:11:11] that foundation of honesty is not there
[1:11:21] that's the very ground for rupturing
[1:11:24] faith
[1:11:32] praise the Lord he prayed earnestly it's
[1:11:38] beautiful how the scripture would
[1:11:40] describe him as a man of like passion he
[1:11:45] was not an angel he was a man of like
[1:11:50] passion he was broke he had he was
[1:11:57] disappointed and there are there things
[1:12:00] that are happy in his life but there is
[1:12:04] that is one thing that James gave us but
[1:12:08] there is another secret that is hidden
[1:12:11] in the scripture and we want for us to
[1:12:14] look at are we together less than to our
[1:12:19] feet and read the Bible
[1:12:34] first Kings chapter 17 I was doing all
[1:12:40] of these things and everything laid out
[1:12:42] anything for the scripture reading I
[1:12:44] just had a bunch of scriptures that we
[1:12:47] that we would go through but let's take
[1:12:49] first Kings chapter 17 and let's
[1:12:51] introduce this man
[1:12:53] Elisha the reason why I wanted to talk
[1:12:56] about this lay the foundation because we
[1:13:00] will be talking about how God used this
[1:13:03] spirit of Elijah or the Norton of Elijah
[1:13:06] through the ages seven times we look at
[1:13:09] all of their together are we together
[1:13:13] first Kings chapter 17 verse 1 any
[1:13:23] larger the Tish birth who was of the
[1:13:27] inhabitants of Gately say onto a hub as
[1:13:32] the Lord God of Israel livid this was
[1:13:37] very very important as the Lord God of
[1:13:42] Israel liveth the reason why Elijah had
[1:13:46] to bring their introduction is because
[1:13:49] bill worship has rised so much to the to
[1:13:53] a high top that the God of Israel was
[1:13:58] like a dead God to the Hebrews so Elijah
[1:14:04] had to emphasize on there as a Lord God
[1:14:08] of Israel liveth before whom I stand
[1:14:14] there shall not be Dew or rain this
[1:14:18] years but our calling to man word amen
[1:14:23] let's pray together father we just want
[1:14:27] to trust you this morning and be able to
[1:14:29] bring this to your people father it's
[1:14:34] not all we can get through this morning
[1:14:38] but I'm asking you to just annoyed the
[1:14:40] word be able to take out some
[1:14:43] thing from the word this morning that
[1:14:45] will lay on our heart that we will see
[1:14:48] the seriousness of the time that we are
[1:14:49] living in and oh god we will see the
[1:14:52] things that you require of us we love
[1:14:55] you and we appreciate you in Jesus name
[1:14:58] Amen
[1:14:59] Allah bless you you may have your seat
[1:15:01] first came chapter 7 chapter 19 first
[1:15:07] Kings chapter 19 let's look there first
[1:15:11] came chapter 19 praise the Lord I want
[1:15:18] to bring another thing that I want you
[1:15:21] to underline and keep in your heart just
[1:15:24] to be able to bring this picture clearly
[1:15:26] first King chapter 19 verse 9 and 10 9
[1:15:35] says and and he came hither onto a cave
[1:15:39] and large deer that's Elijah and behold
[1:15:43] the word of the Lord came unto Him and
[1:15:46] he said unto Him what does thou here
[1:15:51] Elijah and he said Elijah said I have
[1:15:58] been very jealous for the Lord God of
[1:16:03] hosts for the children of Israel have
[1:16:07] forsaken by coveting thrown down thine
[1:16:11] altars and slain thy prophets now you
[1:16:18] see these other things that drove Elijah
[1:16:22] to that condition this is the thing that
[1:16:26] was consuming him this is the thing to
[1:16:29] have got ahold of him that make him to
[1:16:32] go and say God if this is happening shut
[1:16:35] up the heavens if this is the attitude
[1:16:42] of the people how can we be enjoying
[1:16:46] your blessings and we have forsaken you
[1:16:56] now you see that is the reason why the
[1:16:58] scripture interpret itself even though
[1:17:03] chapter 17 brings us on a scene with no
[1:17:06] history of Elijah we don't know his
[1:17:08] parents we don't know where he came from
[1:17:10] we don't know how he grew up but
[1:17:12] somewhere in a structure God hid the
[1:17:16] burden that the the the the the thing
[1:17:18] that was consuming this boy life
[1:17:21] this male life he watched it all through
[1:17:25] the ages who go through that and see a
[1:17:27] little bit but he says right here and
[1:17:29] have been very jealous for the Lord God
[1:17:34] of hosts I have been very jealous for
[1:17:39] the children of Israel has for seeking
[1:17:41] that coveting have been very jealous
[1:17:45] they have trolled down your autos they
[1:17:47] have builded altars of barns they have
[1:17:50] established different things in your
[1:17:52] heart their desires for popularity money
[1:18:03] women the desire for laude sure is more
[1:18:08] than the desire for you they have turned
[1:18:13] down your altars and they have slain
[1:18:16] your prophets
[1:18:17] praise the Lord in this age they are not
[1:18:22] killing them like Jesse bear who killed
[1:18:24] neighbor in this age I mean they are
[1:18:26] just ridiculing the Prophet he says and
[1:18:32] I even I alone so you can see the
[1:18:37] condition he's in with everything that
[1:18:40] he's seen around him he came to believe
[1:18:46] that it's another one that is having the
[1:18:50] problem this thing is just becoming a
[1:18:54] common thing a common way of life I'm
[1:18:56] I'm the only one having this problem I'm
[1:18:59] I don't want to see what is happening
[1:19:01] ah

[1:20:14] praise the Lord
[1:20:18] what are the separation just speaking of
[1:20:21] it in three dispensation we could bring
[1:20:24] it down through the Old Testament and
[1:20:26] through the seven church ages for the
[1:20:29] seven struck and so forth now what he's
[1:20:32] talking about here was when the lamb was
[1:20:35] slain the high priest would take the
[1:20:36] hyssop put it in the blood of the Lamb
[1:20:38] comes to the tabernacle and spring it
[1:20:41] seven times he's going to Centrify
[1:20:44] everything in the tabernacle with the
[1:20:46] blood of the Lamb that was that was
[1:20:48] sacrificed for the sin of the people
[1:20:50] he's going to get seven stripes now he's
[1:20:53] typing there are seven strike with the
[1:20:55] seven church ages which means that seven
[1:20:58] church ages will be under the blood are
[1:21:02] we together through the seven church
[1:21:08] ages for the seven strap and so far and
[1:21:11] that's that's another thing the brothers
[1:21:13] will also be working on they will they
[1:21:16] will take my notes and put it on the
[1:21:18] side so if I read something and you want
[1:21:20] to really be gained
[1:21:22] you can go there and and be able to find
[1:21:24] it okay so we don't want to make up our
[1:21:31] own things we want to make sure we are
[1:21:34] saying what the word is praise the Lord
[1:21:43] there are seven different strikes
[1:21:45] represent the seven Church ages Israel
[1:21:49] natural and the Gentile Church in
[1:21:52] spiritual seven church ages so in one
[1:21:56] sense he's affirming year.there Israel
[1:21:59] Hadiya seven Church ages that was under
[1:22:02] the blood and the Gentile Church will
[1:22:06] have her seven church ages that was also
[1:22:08] under the blood are we together amen
[1:22:12] because he's talking he went and talked
[1:22:17] about the tabernacle the seven golden
[1:22:19] candlesticks that was in the tabernacle
[1:22:22] there are seven golden candlesticks
[1:22:25] representatives and and the seven golden
[1:22:28] candlesticks or inker with the seven
[1:22:31] stripes Paul said in a book of Hebrew
[1:22:34] everything in the tabernacle was
[1:22:37] sprinker you know the blood had to cover
[1:22:40] it praise the Lord
[1:22:42] amen so the blood covered the organs
[1:22:46] that covered the violin they covered the
[1:22:47] drum
[1:22:48] that's the reason why we will not play
[1:22:50] reggae we would happily nothing contrary
[1:22:52] to the world because it must all be
[1:22:54] under the blood are we together
[1:23:05] Israel natural the Gentile church in
[1:23:08] spiritual seven Church ages just exactly
[1:23:11] the same way in Israel had seven church
[1:23:15] ages right in a bloom of it best come
[1:23:22] here and married this marry this
[1:23:27] idolatry and broad and idolaters in and
[1:23:32] course idolatry in Israel the Christian
[1:23:36] Church did the same thing out of the
[1:23:41] Dark Ages come right in and marry right
[1:23:47] into the same thing and brought idolatry
[1:23:50] into the church into the Christian
[1:23:53] Church again why are we not denomination
[1:23:56] just take another thing here if you were
[1:23:58] noticed at the beginning when God begins
[1:24:01] to deal with the Jews and they went
[1:24:04] through that golden age now this is the
[1:24:07] reason why I brought in this out of
[1:24:09] court because Solomon Asch was
[1:24:12] considered the Golden Age amen
[1:24:15] it was the age where the gift of
[1:24:18] discernment was in the midst of the
[1:24:20] people praise the Lord God a gift among
[1:24:26] the people that could know the intents
[1:24:28] of the heart and because of thy gift God
[1:24:33] brought the people to such a place where
[1:24:36] there was no war
[1:24:37] so am I never for the world there was
[1:24:40] peace with all of its nation in every
[1:24:42] day so that was the Golden Age but
[1:24:44] Washington was the thing there that got
[1:24:47] a little bit interesting year to me was
[1:24:50] there through their Golden Age and then
[1:24:53] the darkest age of the Jews the Jewish
[1:24:57] dealing God had with the Jews was in the
[1:25:03] reign of Europe so for the Jews they had
[1:25:06] a golden age before they came to the
[1:25:09] attackers age for the Gentiles we came
[1:25:13] from our darkest age to our goal in age
[1:25:18] why because the Alpha and Omega
[1:25:21] principle must be kept Golden Age in the
[1:25:24] beginning Golden Age at the end I went
[1:25:30] together if you read then through this
[1:25:33] you see bourbon and bringing out the
[1:25:35] same thing year he says and if you
[1:25:38] notice reading those Church edges there
[1:25:40] he gets right back to it again he said
[1:25:43] now a few things a God and said now
[1:25:48] right in that dark age fifteen hundred
[1:25:50] years there or the time of a half first
[1:25:55] and the Jews the darkest age they had
[1:25:59] when Ahab married Jezebel and brought
[1:26:03] idolatry into Israel and may all the
[1:26:09] for worship after a half after Jessica
[1:26:13] Oh God our dog our owner darkest ish was
[1:26:18] Constantine bringing Papa room and pig
[1:26:21] and room together amen
[1:26:24] and then the catholic catholic pagan
[1:26:30] church took over the catholic christian
[1:26:35] church and then that was when all the
[1:26:42] church started going through her
[1:26:43] toughest time where am i with all of
[1:26:47] this
[1:26:48] can somebody tell me praise the Lord
[1:26:53] now so what I wanted to bring out of
[1:26:55] year was Israel coming from the up
[1:26:58] Golden Age to the attack has age and
[1:27:00] then we came through our time our
[1:27:03] darkest age and then we are in our
[1:27:06] golden age amen now so as we as we look
[1:27:14] at this what I want to do here also is
[1:27:17] for us to just set a scene here by the
[1:27:21] grace of God and the structure let us
[1:27:24] know Moses taught the children of Israel
[1:27:27] that God Deuteronomy chapter 18 that God
[1:27:30] was going to raise up a prophet like
[1:27:32] unto Him and you say yeah yeah him there
[1:27:36] was the Lord Jesus Christ are we
[1:27:38] together praise the Lord
[1:27:41] so Jesus was a prophet like unto Moses
[1:27:46] and Jesus testify of John the Baptist
[1:27:51] when they asked John they said were you
[1:27:54] he said I'm the voice of one crying in
[1:27:56] the wilderness and when they asked Jesus
[1:27:58] when was he he said it was that Elijah
[1:28:03] prays alone so two major prophets of the
[1:28:09] Old Testament two cornerstones of the
[1:28:12] Old Testament Moses and Elijah playing
[1:28:16] out in Jesus and John are we together
[1:28:21] praise the Lord
[1:28:25] so but we realize that right after
[1:28:29] Solomon when his son REE Brahm talked
[1:28:33] the truth one of these days I would just
[1:28:36] like to speak on the kings of Israel
[1:28:42] because if those period of time is a
[1:28:46] type of our church age period of time we
[1:28:49] can see the very same thing that were
[1:28:51] happening there happening right here
[1:28:55] amen the fall of Israel the reason why
[1:29:02] the fall the fall of Israel I will bring
[1:29:07] it to you and let you to realize that
[1:29:10] the apostasy of Israel was the
[1:29:16] corrupting of the priesthood when Jay
[1:29:22] LeBron corrupted the priesthood when he
[1:29:25] took men that were not qualified to go
[1:29:28] into the presence of the Lord and he
[1:29:30] bring them to be to be priests he
[1:29:35] corrupted the priesthood that was that
[1:29:41] was you you remember when David went
[1:29:46] together up and use he had tried to hold
[1:29:51] the ark because it was shifting God's
[1:29:54] much him did and we together dad was the
[1:30:04] beginning and that is the same thing
[1:30:06] with our Gentile age when when when when
[1:30:15] cattle is in started setting up
[1:30:17] seminaries and taking men into six month
[1:30:20] one year two year whatever time for them
[1:30:22] to go and learn and bring him man
[1:30:24] they will not qualify to handle the
[1:30:29] priesthood
[1:30:34] praise the Lord and he built three
[1:30:38] places of worship father son Holy Ghost
[1:30:41] turned into blood trained and and one in
[1:30:43] belter one in den and he says Israel
[1:30:46] this is the God that have brought you
[1:30:48] out there's no need of going to the
[1:30:50] temple where the Shekinah glory came
[1:30:52] down no need of going to Jerusalem nor
[1:30:54] near burned to Solomon temple he set up
[1:30:57] these things and he caught the people
[1:30:59] away from the presence of God
[1:31:00] he caught the people away from the from
[1:31:02] the the the the how you call it now the
[1:31:09] only place of worship there are Dame
[1:31:13] place of worship they place that God say
[1:31:17] he will meet men they place that God put
[1:31:22] his name God the people are from that
[1:31:24] and just gave them forms and just gave
[1:31:29] them you know big buildings and
[1:31:34] celebration and the people don't even
[1:31:38] know their God they go to church and
[1:31:42] they don't even know their God they can
[1:31:49] reference a Holy Father gave him all the
[1:31:53] respect and disrespect God on the basis
[1:31:56] of his world
[1:32:02] it's lying right there it's in the
[1:32:04] scripture go up order there for a reason
[1:32:07] and I'm hoping that the grace of God
[1:32:11] will be able to help us because if you
[1:32:14] don't help us we will be doing the scene
[1:32:17] amen
[1:32:19] we will be doing the same we can talk
[1:32:21] about history we can talk about you know
[1:32:23] God sent us a prophet the Prophet spoke
[1:32:25] scars into existence we believe that we
[1:32:28] love it but we are also getting into an
[1:32:33] area were the word is getting in the
[1:32:44] hands of men and that's supposed to be
[1:32:46] Henry in the world are we together he
[1:32:52] corrupted the priesthood
[1:32:54] so after Solomon it was 58 years 58
[1:32:59] years that's between the time of Solomon
[1:33:02] and GE bro because right after Solomon
[1:33:05] his son really Braun took the throne and
[1:33:06] the kingdom splitted and God said
[1:33:09] because of my seven David's sake and we
[1:33:15] keep a light in Israel I will always
[1:33:18] keep a man on the throne of Judah I will
[1:33:25] together but so then wash it now from
[1:33:28] from Jerry Brown to Ahab there were
[1:33:32] seven evil wicked kings and they
[1:33:37] progress in their wickedness from one
[1:33:39] form of wickedness to another form of
[1:33:41] wickedness let's take our Bibles let's
[1:33:44] go quickly if we still on is because you
[1:33:50] slow me down first came chapter 12
[1:33:59] first King chapter 12
[1:34:17] first Kings chapter 2 off let's read
[1:34:21] from verse 25 quickly then Joe Abram
[1:34:25] bill shush him in money front and dword
[1:34:29] there and went out from banks and bill
[1:34:32] Pannell and and and Joe Brown said in
[1:34:36] his heart now shall the kingdom return
[1:34:39] to the house of David
[1:34:41] if these people go up to sacrifice in
[1:34:46] the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[1:34:49] shall the heart of these people turn
[1:34:52] again the turning of the heart
[1:34:54] that's the elijah ministry he's turning
[1:34:57] the hearts of the people from God he
[1:35:00] said if the people constantly go to
[1:35:02] Jerusalem their heart will be in
[1:35:05] Jerusalem the heart will be with the God
[1:35:07] of Israel amen then surely then shall
[1:35:14] the heart of these people turn again on
[1:35:17] to their Lord even on to replumb the
[1:35:22] king of Judah and they shall kill me and
[1:35:25] go to rib Ramat he do were on to the
[1:35:28] king to counsel and make two cups of
[1:35:32] gold and said unto them it is too much
[1:35:37] for you to go up to Jerusalem a man is
[1:35:43] too much for you to fast and pray and be
[1:35:47] crying just come father son Holy Ghost
[1:35:51] if you can pass the beasts and just go
[1:35:55] up and down that's enough it's too much
[1:35:57] it's too much for you to go up to
[1:36:01] Jerusalem behold that God be all that
[1:36:04] God o Israel which brought thee up out
[1:36:09] of the land of Egypt and he said one in
[1:36:14] belter and the other he put in them and
[1:36:17] this thing became a scene I mean for the
[1:36:23] people went to worship before the one
[1:36:26] even on to Dan
[1:36:30] he made an house of high places
[1:36:34] and made priests of the lowest just last
[1:36:39] week we were talking about how God
[1:36:41] called Moses and say you bring the
[1:36:44] priests you washed him you are noting he
[1:36:49] was not even in the priesthood this is
[1:36:50] just a king I mean this is just and I'm
[1:36:53] a commander he's a military man and he
[1:36:57] said now he has bill churches for the
[1:37:00] people to worship he has given them God
[1:37:02] and now he has employed people to be
[1:37:05] priests I'm going to pay you a salary
[1:37:07] you just do like this convince the
[1:37:11] people to stay in this house praise the
[1:37:16] Lord I'm not just making noise praise
[1:37:25] the Lord
[1:37:28] young people don't just be satisfied
[1:37:30] coming to church get in the war see the
[1:37:33] things that are happening are we
[1:37:43] together
[1:37:46] he made priests of the lowest of the
[1:37:50] people he made priests of the lowest in
[1:37:53] a sense people that have by repetition
[1:37:56] of the lowest of the people marish and
[1:38:08] divorced two or three times
[1:38:14] I went together and he took those people
[1:38:18] and brought him right into the priests
[1:38:21] who I went together which were net of
[1:38:28] the sons of the Levi wish when addy
[1:38:31] never had no right to the priesthood
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:39] I'm the reason why I'm saying this it's
[1:38:43] not to be personal I'm trying to show
[1:38:46] you the kind of a weight the evil that
[1:38:52] was done amen
[1:38:56] don't feel sorry for God because we
[1:39:00] can't help him are we together I'm just
[1:39:04] trying to show you the reason why God
[1:39:08] will bring a man the thing that consumed
[1:39:10] a larger to see people that don't have
[1:39:14] repetition smoking in there in a street
[1:39:19] corner running around with women but
[1:39:20] yell at the same people that come and
[1:39:22] make sacrifices goes for the thing that
[1:39:24] was consuming
[1:39:24] a larger he said I'm being jealous after
[1:39:28] the Lord God of Israel I've been just
[1:39:31] after the churn of Israel they had
[1:39:33] thrown down the altar no church or the
[1:39:35] no regard for God no respect
[1:39:38] it's all about just form formality
[1:39:49] praise Lord and if God if God has been
[1:39:57] gracious to be able to to open our eyes
[1:40:02] so any larger ministration we sit down
[1:40:04] and a lobbyist seems to creep back in ho
[1:40:11] young people living in the Asian day
[1:40:13] that we are in when you see the things
[1:40:15] that young people are doing you must be
[1:40:17] jealous for your Lord God
[1:40:20] you must be jealous for your Lord God
[1:40:24] now you're happy jealous that's the
[1:40:33] reason why I'm trying to make this thing
[1:40:35] so ugly
[1:40:38] I'm trying for the Holy Ghost to make
[1:40:42] you to see how ugly it was praise the
[1:40:48] Lord
[1:40:49] and don't think that you can you can
[1:40:53] just walk over the Word of God and get
[1:40:56] angry and say every Church is church I'm
[1:40:58] gonna find another church to go to you
[1:41:00] go there and then you find you'll find
[1:41:05] your God that you are worshiping like
[1:41:07] I've always said don't bring your God
[1:41:09] yet there is one goal we are worshiping
[1:41:16] yeah people say I just come to worship
[1:41:18] my god don't bring I hope it is the one
[1:41:20] that we are worshiping that's how ugly
[1:41:28] it was amen and Giroux Brahm ordained a
[1:41:36] feast in the eighth month okay that's
[1:41:39] how ugly it was
[1:41:40] that's how ugly this oh I'll wait to
[1:41:42] talk about amen
[1:41:44] first screen chapter 15 let's go quickly
[1:41:48] I have some few other things scriptures
[1:41:52] I want to read to you here but let's go
[1:41:55] quickly the time we'll be able to get my
[1:41:59] first stream chapter 15 verse 26 first
[1:42:04] Kings chapter 15 verse 26
[1:42:16] praise the Lord verse 26 he was the next
[1:42:26] one the Bible says and now that the son
[1:42:29] of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel
[1:42:33] in the second year of our king of Judah
[1:42:38] in hearing over Israel two years and he
[1:42:43] did evil in the sight of the Lord and
[1:42:46] walk in the way of his father and in his
[1:42:52] sin were in he may is racing and what
[1:42:56] was that sin cutting the people from the
[1:42:59] place of worship
[1:43:00] introducing the people to idolatry amen
[1:43:14] chapter 727 let's read the next verse
[1:43:17] the Bible talked about about the son of
[1:43:20] a Hodja or the house of a sacar conspire
[1:43:25] against him and and he smote him gibbet
[1:43:34] on which belong it to the Philistine for
[1:43:37] neither and all Israel lad siege there
[1:43:42] so he was the one that took over nether
[1:43:45] and what he went into conspiracy amen
[1:43:51] that was what he went into and then the
[1:43:55] next guy came on the scene was chapter
[1:43:58] 16 verse 8 I just I just want to see
[1:44:02] right from children seven kings amen and
[1:44:10] this was in Israel not in Judah because
[1:44:15] God was preserving Judah for his seventh
[1:44:18] David's sake amen
[1:44:22] the people have forsaken the Lord God he
[1:44:26] had left that the Temple of Solomon so
[1:44:29] that they have gone on their own as
[1:44:32] seven kings are we together
[1:44:45] verse eight and in the twenty and six
[1:44:55] years of our king of Judea begin Eli the
[1:45:02] son of Beijing to reign over Israel in
[1:45:07] tears of two years and right after that
[1:45:10] came as the first as a second tier the
[1:45:15] fourth and came the fifth King
[1:45:18] there's Zimmern in his seven similar
[1:45:24] captain of half of the chair conspired
[1:45:26] against him as so you can just see the
[1:45:30] rising to evil they are conspiring and
[1:45:34] games itself
[1:45:35] committing treason I mean you can just
[1:45:37] see evil just rolling over evil it's
[1:45:41] just rolling over evil that is a reason
[1:45:46] why a revelation 18:4 have to come on
[1:45:50] the scene come out of her my people
[1:45:53] because there's no way you can save that
[1:45:55] situation there is no way you can redeem
[1:45:59] it because it's just evil building on
[1:46:02] top of evil rolling over evil conspiring
[1:46:07] against evil killing evil that's the
[1:46:14] reason why there had to be a revelation
[1:46:17] 18:4 voice come out of her my people and
[1:46:22] being that partaker of her sin I will
[1:46:26] together chapter 25 verse 25 and 26
[1:46:32] surah the same chapter over there we
[1:46:34] give us the net skin amen
[1:46:43] 25 and 26 we give us the nest king it's
[1:46:48] beautiful the Word of God is beautiful
[1:46:51] praise the Lord Amen man shall not live
[1:46:55] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:46:58] comes from the mouth of God
[1:47:00] Oh may God increase our appetite for the
[1:47:05] world
[1:47:05] may God gave us a desire to be able to
[1:47:08] read his word to be able to love his
[1:47:11] word to be able to learn from his word
[1:47:23] verse 25 26
[1:47:29] but Umrah rough evil in the eyes of the
[1:47:34] Lord
[1:47:34] and did worse than all that will be for
[1:47:40] him amen
[1:47:42] he did evil in the sight of the Lord and
[1:47:45] he did worse then the other five kings
[1:47:50] that would be for him are we together
[1:47:55] for he walks in a whale of jail bruh and
[1:47:59] in his scene worrying he made Israel to
[1:48:01] sing praise the Lord but drop down to
[1:48:05] verse 29 it brings a harp on the scene
[1:48:12] in the taralyn 80 years of us a king of
[1:48:18] Judah begin 1/2 the son of amram this
[1:48:21] one that did evil above all Kings let's
[1:48:24] see what his song we do are we together
[1:48:34] are we together
[1:48:43] summer I'm ready to reign over Israel
[1:48:49] here in over Israel and Samara two years
[1:48:53] and a half the summer the son of armour
[1:48:55] did evil in the sight of the Lord above
[1:48:58] all that way before him amen his father
[1:49:06] did worse than all that were before him
[1:49:09] he did above he went overboard are we
[1:49:18] together
[1:49:26] that is the reason why we must make use
[1:49:28] of the grace that has come to us because
[1:49:33] the Lord of God still lives is the word
[1:49:37] of God forever God visit the scene the
[1:49:40] iniquity of the parents so when we come
[1:49:43] to the Lord Jesus don't play with your
[1:49:46] new birth young people make sure you are
[1:49:48] born again make sure you have the Holy
[1:49:50] Ghost because that new birth the baptism
[1:49:53] of the Holy Ghost is going to destroy
[1:49:55] that curse don't play Church make sure
[1:50:01] you meet God make sure you know God
[1:50:07] praise the Lord and we have people we
[1:50:12] have many at I can stand with you he
[1:50:20] went overboard
[1:50:21] he did above I were together and it came
[1:50:34] to pass as if it had been a light thing
[1:50:40] for him to walk in a scene of Jubran you
[1:50:43] see when seen when we allow sin we allow
[1:50:48] sin in our life it starts to become our
[1:50:50] way of life then it does not condemn you
[1:50:53] anymore you don't feel check on it and
[1:50:55] then you can just but it is going to
[1:50:58] produce something worse than what you
[1:51:01] are in so the Bible says as if it was a
[1:51:04] lie thing you know that the worship of
[1:51:08] Jubran going to belter going to down
[1:51:10] worshiping all of this grow to a half
[1:51:13] these are little things these are little
[1:51:16] things I'm the king I mean as if it was
[1:51:26] a little thing as if it was a lie thing
[1:51:28] to walk in a sinner Jairam that he took
[1:51:31] the wife he talked to wife Jezebel
[1:51:38] he took to wife jezebel the daughter of
[1:51:47] L by the king of all the Xena nights and
[1:51:52] when and safe bill and worship him so he
[1:51:57] crowned it up he took Israel into a
[1:52:01] worse form of idolatry because what
[1:52:04] Jubran brought now see what he did he
[1:52:07] told the people this is your God that
[1:52:09] brought you out so his groves were
[1:52:12] representing Jehovah but for a half he
[1:52:17] took the people across the border and he
[1:52:21] brought in strange worship praise the
[1:52:25] Lord amen
[1:52:28] the church is getting so bored so we
[1:52:31] have to bring all these you know
[1:52:33] spiritual worship and all of these
[1:52:35] things and I mean and we just trying to
[1:52:37] make things happen we let's do something
[1:52:40] so we mean and that's just what he did
[1:52:44] as if it was a light thing he went and
[1:52:47] married the daughter of a false god
[1:52:52] worship brought right here into Israel
[1:52:58] praise the Lord
[1:52:59] and he read up an altar for bill in
[1:53:04] hustle bill which he built he came and
[1:53:08] built a very big mighty church and
[1:53:12] brought to God and I don't write the
[1:53:19] praise the Lord and we together
[1:53:25] now there is another thing in this
[1:53:28] scripture I don't know where we are with
[1:53:30] time but there is another thing in this
[1:53:32] structure that is so beautiful I was
[1:53:34] thinking about it last night as I was
[1:53:36] studying amen
[1:53:38] and and the Bible talks about 1/2 verse
[1:53:43] 33 and a half may groves and 1/2 did
[1:53:48] more to provoke the Lord God of Israel
[1:53:52] to anger than all the kings of Israel
[1:53:57] that would be for him he did more to
[1:54:00] provoke but now right here
[1:54:03] the last verse the holy spirit put that
[1:54:07] verse in to also help us to see the kind
[1:54:11] of a time that was how the age the time
[1:54:15] the things that were happening and what
[1:54:19] did the scriptures say let's read it
[1:54:20] together
[1:54:22] the scripture says in in his days which
[1:54:27] mean in the day of oh yeah amen he'll
[1:54:37] the the bank might bail Jericho he laid
[1:54:43] a foundation thereof in a barren his
[1:54:46] firstborn and set up the gates thereof
[1:54:51] in his youngest son so what what what
[1:54:55] the diverse means why is this verse here
[1:54:58] an age of defiance this verse reveal
[1:55:04] that the people have got so much to the
[1:55:07] level until they were ready to defy God
[1:55:13] Amen defy God by changing the agendas
[1:55:17] and changing in all the things that is
[1:55:20] the age of the spirit of the age how are
[1:55:25] they deferring God Joshua said in Joshua
[1:55:28] chapter 6 that Jericho was cursed and it
[1:55:32] will never be built an enemy that tried
[1:55:35] to do it he will have
[1:55:38] used a blot of his songs are we together
[1:55:49] he will have to use the blood of his
[1:55:51] sons Joshua chapter 6 verse 26 you can
[1:55:58] read that so that that is the age now
[1:56:07] are those were the things that were
[1:56:08] happening those were the things that
[1:56:12] were happening in these kings these
[1:56:16] kings were representing the leaders they
[1:56:20] were representing the political power
[1:56:21] they were and the whole thing was just
[1:56:23] mix praise the Lord
[1:56:36] if can I be able to find that this
[1:56:41] morning I'm reading there somewhere were
[1:56:45] brother branham cry out on it you know
[1:56:48] he talks about this nation is calm it's
[1:56:55] a seed things that we are doing amen
[1:57:03] that's the reason why we must be looking
[1:57:06] for a heavenly dream than an American
[1:57:08] dream
[1:57:22] are we together divine hill in 1954 if
[1:57:28] you have that with you dear
[1:57:30] Jose now I was seen at a very it's at a
[1:57:36] very cursory Jericho it's in the viola
[1:57:38] Jerusalem on the hill and a man like we
[1:57:43] read of the Good Samaritan never been
[1:57:46] talking about Good Samaritan yeah when
[1:57:48] he was coming down from Jericho gory I
[1:57:52] mean from Jerusalem going to Jericho he
[1:57:55] was back sledding coming out of the city
[1:57:59] of the bless and going down to the city
[1:58:02] of the curse and that's and that's when
[1:58:06] he fell among the thieves and God
[1:58:09] stripped and wounded in line have
[1:58:12] they're spiritually dead physically
[1:58:14] alive and and and and then this city was
[1:58:17] a curse City the world had dropped down
[1:58:22] once and and Joshua cursed the city and
[1:58:25] the person that we ever tried to build
[1:58:28] it again he cursed the city and he
[1:58:33] cursed the person that will ever try to
[1:58:36] build it again he said you will lay the
[1:58:41] foundation in the blood so it's not
[1:58:45] really that he took his son and and
[1:58:48] killed his son to build a city no they
[1:58:51] were devouring God that we would build
[1:58:53] this city he was a firing God that we
[1:58:58] were will raise the world of Jericho
[1:59:00] once again praise the Lord
[1:59:06] and why trying to do that it caused him
[1:59:10] the life of his son that is the kind of
[1:59:14] age see the scene that have been said
[1:59:17] horrible scene people defying God people
[1:59:22] going over the border with evil and
[1:59:25] wickedness in their heart
[1:59:28] praise the Lord
[1:59:38] they want to do all of that and then
[1:59:42] they say the church must be a loving
[1:59:43] Church you know it's a loving Church we
[1:59:48] must be able to accept people there is
[1:59:50] one person that is in control yet that
[1:59:52] is God amen then right after that our
[2:00:02] strip sure reading comes on the scene
[2:00:05] Elijah the Tishbite comes from behind
[2:00:09] the curtain of such such a darkness open
[2:00:16] the curtain and he stepped on the scene
[2:00:18] walking right to Ahab and said no rain
[2:00:23] not even do you or wash now
[2:00:27] God don't break his word God don't break
[2:00:31] his word let's stay together amen
[2:00:38] because God don't break his word the
[2:00:42] autonomy chapter 11
[2:00:54] now you see we do these things you know
[2:01:00] just to be able to help you to see young
[2:01:04] people no matter what people are saying
[2:01:06] about the messaging I mean any have on
[2:01:09] the internet and all of the other thing
[2:01:10] about the Prophet there is a ministry
[2:01:13] that has been raised in our day if you
[2:01:18] don't see the condition of your age if
[2:01:20] you don't know the condition of your
[2:01:22] health you will not know how much you
[2:01:24] need a doctor if you don't know the
[2:01:27] condition of the age you will not know
[2:01:29] how much you need the message to get us
[2:01:35] out of here if you don't know your
[2:01:41] spiritual condition you would not know
[2:01:43] how much you need the Holy Ghost
[2:01:49] how would you get a verse 16 you know I
[2:01:57] was doing this this last night it took
[2:02:00] my mind way back to 1994 it took my mind
[2:02:07] way back to 1994 I like I used to like
[2:02:13] approaching preaching like this but I
[2:02:18] dropped teaching and started running
[2:02:20] after Devils
[2:02:21] I would together let's look at verse 16
[2:02:27] they look at verse 16 but I'm trying to
[2:02:30] bring this just so we can be able to see
[2:02:33] some things here and when I was doing
[2:02:39] this I look at this scripture and what
[2:02:41] came to my mind was a larger reading
[2:02:46] Moses record and seeing that Moses is
[2:02:49] saying this very thing and what he says
[2:02:56] let me let's go back to verse 13 and it
[2:02:59] shall come to pass if ye if ye shiok him
[2:03:02] diligently unto my commandment we
[2:03:05] I command you this day to love the Lord
[2:03:08] your God and to serve him with all your
[2:03:11] heart and with all your soul that I will
[2:03:14] give you the ring I will give you the
[2:03:18] ring of your length in his due season
[2:03:23] the first ring in the lettering that
[2:03:26] down may a gather that comes and I whine
[2:03:28] and are all and and and I was saying
[2:03:33] grinds in the field for your cuddles
[2:03:35] that there are myriad eat and before
[2:03:39] take heed take heed to yourself that
[2:03:42] your heart be not deceived and yet turn
[2:03:48] aside and serve other gods and worship
[2:03:51] them that was exactly what was happening
[2:03:54] they had turned and started worshipping
[2:03:57] other gods and then the Lord wrath be
[2:04:02] candid against you and he shot the
[2:04:05] heavens that there be no rain and that
[2:04:10] the lane year
[2:04:11] not fruits Elisha perish
[2:04:16] so who Elisha been looking at what Moses
[2:04:20] said and said God that is exact of what
[2:04:22] is happening I praise shut up the
[2:04:25] heavens this is what you said in your
[2:04:27] word this is the evil that is happening
[2:04:39] praise the Lord
[2:04:41] are we together
[2:04:56] I will to gather people I mean we are
[2:05:02] setting the scene that is the reason why
[2:05:05] it was important for God to bring a man
[2:05:08] like this on the scene it was important
[2:05:11] for God to bring a ministry but it did
[2:05:15] not happen it happened in the closet it
[2:05:20] happened with a young man reading the
[2:05:23] Word of God getting jealous for God
[2:05:29] getting passion on his heart praise the
[2:05:37] Lord
[2:05:37] another young man seeing his friend
[2:05:39] peers in their ears and going and taking
[2:05:41] funny thing and sticking it on his ear
[2:05:43] I'm not piercing my ear but I'm I'm
[2:05:45] guess it was a young man I was burning
[2:05:48] in his heart
[2:05:54] zillions for God and you know what he
[2:06:00] felt like he was alone and sometimes
[2:06:05] that is the way God have to put you in a
[2:06:08] situation it had to look like only you
[2:06:11] for him to really deal with you he don't
[2:06:14] give you no roommate amen he don't give
[2:06:18] you some other too lame or what I mean
[2:06:20] you know he makes you look like your
[2:06:22] situation is sooner you your own is
[2:06:24] horrible then he starts dealing with
[2:06:31] your heart then he's using that to draw
[2:06:34] you closer a young man that was looking
[2:06:38] at a situation friends no friends I'm
[2:06:43] going to stay with the Word of God let
[2:06:46] them call me whatever they were coming
[2:06:48] in school I'm going to stay with the
[2:06:49] Word of God
[2:06:58] praise the Lord it's not you feeling
[2:07:01] sorry for yourself but you feeling sorry
[2:07:04] for them because they don't know better
[2:07:07] but what the devil would do he use all
[2:07:09] of those things and put you to the place
[2:07:11] and now you feeling sorry for yourself
[2:07:13] when you're supposed to be proud that
[2:07:16] grace is on your side you're supposed to
[2:07:19] be proud that grace has preserved your
[2:07:21] life and young man if if Elijah was not
[2:07:32] reading the scripture if he was not
[2:07:35] reading these were the last words of
[2:07:37] Moses to the children of Israel if you
[2:07:39] keep my Commandments
[2:07:40] and we pour down the rain I will bless
[2:07:42] you well take it to yourself take him to
[2:07:46] yourself because God is obligated to his
[2:07:49] word now you take him to yourself if you
[2:07:59] disrespect the Word of God say I will
[2:08:03] shut up the heavens my goodness
[2:08:05] I believe you Elijah woke up from
[2:08:08] reading that word oh god oh god I didn't
[2:08:12] know worshipping false gods why are you
[2:08:15] still blessing us God shut up the
[2:08:19] heavens
[2:08:21] let them know that you us take God he
[2:08:29] woke up with such an assurance in his
[2:08:30] heart my goodness praising horror a
[2:08:35] sheepskin around him he never had
[2:08:37] congregation to escort him to the palace
[2:08:39] he was walking alone and just like John
[2:08:49] the Baptist aide to hero he says it is
[2:08:52] an abomination for you to be living with
[2:08:54] your brother's wife that was exactly
[2:08:57] what Elijah did right in the face of a
[2:09:00] hug you and your father house but I
[2:09:04] would tell you no ring or deal until I
[2:09:08] cooperate
[2:09:12] de Tirana me chapter xxxii let's take
[2:09:15] another verse there and see how serious
[2:09:18] this thing is like brother branham will
[2:09:27] say this is the background of Elijah
[2:09:29] this is the background of the Elijah
[2:09:32] ministry amen
[2:09:36] endlessly brain is the background of the
[2:09:39] Elijah ministry a zeal for God is the
[2:09:45] background of the Elijah ministry you
[2:09:48] can run for the mistress in Rome for all
[2:09:50] the seven see if you don't have the
[2:09:53] foundation you will crumble and we to
[2:10:03] get it praise the Lord
[2:10:14] these were the last words of Moses just
[2:10:20] like he said to Joshua take heed don't
[2:10:23] depart let not my word let not the world
[2:10:25] depart from out of your mouth so Elijah
[2:10:28] remember that and what he did he went
[2:10:33] back he said Moses instructed he
[2:10:40] instructed Joshua not to depart from the
[2:10:43] world and we together chapter 32 verse 2
[2:10:54] let's read from verse 1 give ears or
[2:10:58] heaven and I will speak in here or if
[2:11:01] the words of my mouth my daughterís
[2:11:06] shall drop as the rain my speech
[2:11:12] sure distill as the deal I mean as the
[2:11:21] small rain is upon the tongue tenor
[2:11:23] hopes in as a shower upon the grass now
[2:11:27] so this verse shows the spiritual
[2:11:31] condition so a larger bringing judgment
[2:11:37] of Israel or saying they don't deserve
[2:11:41] the blessings of God because when God
[2:11:46] poured down rain just like we read he
[2:11:50] sees the former rain and the latter rain
[2:11:52] that was what Moses said but joy said
[2:11:56] the same thing in the book of Joel and
[2:11:58] then the New Testament church took it
[2:12:00] for a spiritual meaning
[2:12:05] so yeah God is saying my daughter in my
[2:12:08] principle that I gave to them to the
[2:12:10] church to my people it comes in a form
[2:12:15] of rain that's why we get our principal
[2:12:18] the formal rain in the latter rain amen
[2:12:23] the teaching rain
[2:12:28] he says a my speech it's like the deal
[2:12:33] and if you dis pass my word then you
[2:12:38] don't deserve the physical blessing
[2:12:44] praise the Lord amen
[2:13:00] a few other things they're tough I would
[2:13:08] have loved for us to look into and we
[2:13:17] don't have the time here this morning to
[2:13:20] look into it for Branham said is and all
[2:13:32] praise the Lord
[2:13:49] that's looking away looking away to
[2:13:54] Jesus this was now originally out of my
[2:14:01] notes for this morning was something I
[2:14:04] wanted to look at another time but Joe
[2:14:12] if he can look back there died just sin
[2:14:14] death and I just want to read that while
[2:14:19] we close this morning looking away to
[2:14:23] Jesus I just want to read there while we
[2:14:27] close I was subject this morning we pick
[2:14:29] it up from somewhere that the Lord gave
[2:14:32] us grace there's coming a time upon this
[2:14:36] nation to wear this nation is going to
[2:14:39] exercise all the power that the beasts
[2:14:43] had before
[2:14:45] a young man you'll stop making noise
[2:14:48] okay there's coming a time upon this
[2:14:56] nation to word this nation is going to
[2:14:58] exercise all the power that the beasts
[2:15:03] had before which was taken wrong when it
[2:15:09] became Papa room there this nation would
[2:15:14] do there revelation 13 cleanly explain
[2:15:19] it
[2:15:20] the lamb came up came up out of the
[2:15:24] earth there are other beasts came up out
[2:15:28] of the water
[2:15:31] thickness and mater to you you know
[2:15:34] because I was I was there was some
[2:15:37] things I was looking at and it's telling
[2:15:40] the lawn and there's just one of the
[2:15:42] thing I like to talk about as we go
[2:15:44] along with this I want to talk a little
[2:15:46] bit about rapture in faith we have heard
[2:15:49] over and over I was telling talking to
[2:15:51] brother Dan and talking about a Sunday
[2:15:53] School a little bit I will hope that
[2:15:57] pretty
[2:15:59] we will go into using more more of the
[2:16:03] tapes on the Sunday school there's a
[2:16:05] reason why I want to do that you know
[2:16:08] there's a reason why I want to do that
[2:16:10] is because we hear this statement
[2:16:15] rapture in faith is on the tapes the
[2:16:20] tapes were never goes aging men has
[2:16:23] always been girls aging amen
[2:16:27] but the reason did is because it's not
[2:16:31] that faith is on the tapes no but those
[2:16:35] things that are on the on the tapes are
[2:16:38] able to quick in faith that is in you
[2:16:45] are we together amen they are able to
[2:16:52] quit him now because we can we can get
[2:16:55] in all the technology where balances
[2:16:58] rapture and finish on the tips he never
[2:17:00] said on the cities amen
[2:17:05] he never said on the little chip he
[2:17:08] never said I'm sorry Phyllis is
[2:17:10] downloading your computer so the thing
[2:17:12] about it is not a tip is not the medium
[2:17:17] the thing that brings faith is when your
[2:17:20] soul is connected to that word when you
[2:17:24] are listening to the word and God say
[2:17:27] something and it quick is something to
[2:17:28] you are we together so I don't I don't I
[2:17:37] don't I don't want anybody can afford
[2:17:38] miss understanding me and thing that I'm
[2:17:40] fighting against tape I'm not fighting
[2:17:42] against tape either like even the thing
[2:17:46] for our young people we're going to
[2:17:49] going into our our I want to do tip
[2:17:51] questions listen to the tape tell me
[2:17:54] what you pick up from there because when
[2:18:00] that thing does not click it will never
[2:18:03] become interesting to you
[2:18:08] if that voice does not quicken something
[2:18:11] in you it will never be and I think it's
[2:18:16] our responsibility to encourage you
[2:18:18] whatever we can do to encourage you is
[2:18:21] our responsibility praise the Lord
[2:18:32] are we together so he's talking about
[2:18:37] all of these things and talking about I
[2:18:40] mean we're actually we are coming down
[2:18:42] to the things that are happening around
[2:18:44] us a lot of things happening in the
[2:18:47] world young people
[2:18:57] but we want to encourage you this
[2:18:59] morning want to encourage you bring it
[2:19:04] down to this he was a man of like
[2:19:08] passion but there was one thing that was
[2:19:14] in his heart he was earnest when he went
[2:19:17] to God in prayer
[2:19:18] he was earnest about the thing he said
[2:19:23] because there's I mean there is just I
[2:19:25] mean he's I mean he's the only person
[2:19:28] that because all the devil dealing with
[2:19:33] our life he's guessing but God is not
[2:19:36] guessing with our life there's nothing
[2:19:37] that we can hear from him the devil
[2:19:39] don't know the details of our life
[2:19:41] because it's placed under the blood so
[2:19:44] he's guessing he probably that's the
[2:19:46] reason why he tempt that's what tempting
[2:19:48] is all about but when it comes to the
[2:19:55] Creator when it comes to the God of
[2:19:58] heaven and earth we must be earnest amen
[2:20:06] we must be earnest and let the jealousy
[2:20:12] of God
[2:20:12] let's get so jealous for God like gets
[2:20:16] so jealous for God that's the thing that
[2:20:24] put Elijah in that situation praise the
[2:20:29] Lord musicians you can come this morning
[2:20:35] while we think on these things while we
[2:20:41] think on these things that are happening
[2:20:44] there just so many things here that I
