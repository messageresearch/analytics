[35:58] blessing the service before the service
[36:00] begin. [music] Amen.

[36:04] and I I always try to do that every time
[36:06] we have brother uh family around. I
[36:09] always love to play the tape where
[36:12] brother Brandham call his [music] dad
[36:14] and that was the tape that was playing
[36:16] tonight.
[36:18] But that was not actually the thing that
[36:20] uh that [music] moved the service. And
[36:23] uh uh
[36:26] u
[36:28] exactly what he had on his heart to
[36:30] preach tonight. And uh a brother just
[36:33] sent him a call. He was just sharing
[36:35] that with me. And I mean [music] we were
[36:37] just uh just fellowshipping there and
[36:39] and and the presence of the Lord just
[36:41] came down. [music] So I believe that uh
[36:44] we're going to have a good time tonight.
[36:45] Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're going to have a
[36:47] good time tonight [music] and uh we
[36:50] continue that tape tomorrow and then uh
[36:53] we we will bring out that particular
[36:54] session where brother Brandon [music]
[36:56] call his dad in in the audience and uh
[37:00] uh a little boy that was in his
[37:02] feet will be preaching [music] for us
[37:04] tonight. Amen. Not as a man but
[37:07] as a man that was healed by the angel of
[37:09] the Lord.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. [clears throat]
[37:13] So we just thank the Lord tonight. We
[37:15] just thank the Lord tonight. I'm just
[37:17] I'm already feeling good. Amen.

[37:21] Lord. I'm already feeling [music] good.
[37:23] So, let's just bow our heads and pray
[37:25] and then we turn the service over.

[40:55] Lord, my answer will be yes. Lord
[41:01] [singing]
[41:02] yes. [music]
[41:05] And the same spirit that raised up Jesus
[41:07] from the dead. Let's sing a chorus of
[41:09] that. [music] Amen. We turn the service
[41:11] over to the preacher.
[41:25] [music]
[41:33] Let's clap [music] our hands now.
[41:38] Spirit that raised [music] Christ from
[41:41] the dead dwell in you.
[41:46] Dw in you.
[41:48] Water will [singing] break in. [music]
[41:52] Your love will ab
[41:57] [singing]
[41:58] [music]
[42:00] you
[42:03] will break [music] in your mortal body.
[42:08] Oh yes. If the [music and singing]
[42:09] spirit

[42:15] Oh, if the [music] spirit
[42:19] that raised Christ from the dead dw in
[42:22] you.
[42:24] If it dwell in me. [singing and music]

[42:54] ever quaking [music]
[42:56] your mortal body [singing]
[43:01] spirit.
[43:02] [music]
[43:04] [singing]
[43:06] Come on.
[43:12] [music]
[43:21] How many [music] is ready for just a
[43:23] little bit more quickening tonight?
[43:25] [singing]
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:31] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, before we bow our heads
[43:34] and pray again, I just want to share a
[43:37] little bit of about what's been going on
[43:41] in my life over the past two or three
[43:44] days. Number one,
[43:50] the quote and the [music] tape that you
[43:54] was playing before service.
[43:59] We just shared at home
[44:03] amongst the church
[44:06] in text going one to another
[44:09] three days ago.
[44:16] My pastor just [music] sent me a text
[44:22] and
[44:23] I sent him back a message
[44:27] that one of the scriptures that I'm
[44:29] going to start out with
[44:33] was what he had just sent to [music] me.
[44:38] And what it was
[44:40] is you keep that light going in the
[44:43] church
[44:45] because that's the lifeline of the
[44:47] church [music] is what the prophet of
[44:49] God said.
[44:55] And then what brother Juan just closed
[44:58] the the pre-ervice with,
[45:02] I've got written down here that I want
[45:05] to refer to that scripture.
[45:09] If the same spirit that raised [music]
[45:12] Christ from the dead,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; dwells in us,
[45:16] &gt;&gt; it'll quicken our mortal bodies
[45:19] &gt;&gt; the same way that it did him.
[45:22] Because the characteristics [music]
[45:25] of the spirit is the same [singing] no
[45:28] matter where it's at. If it was in the
[45:31] Lord Jesus, then
[45:33] &gt;&gt; you remember the prophet of God said
[45:36] that if the if the the spirit of John
[45:39] Dillinger was on you, it caused you to
[45:43] to shoot guns and rob banks.
[45:46] But if the spirit of Jesus Christ be in
[45:50] us, it'll cause us to do the same thing
[45:54] that it did when he was walking.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads if you would.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Father, how grateful that we are [music]
[46:05] for your love and mercy to us, Lord. and
[46:09] and just seeing you [music] work in such
[46:11] a way Lord that when my computer didn't
[46:15] even want to print out what would I'll
[46:18] be reading [music] from here Lord but
[46:20] just seeing you come on the scene
[46:23] &gt;&gt; so that it would [music]
[46:27] &gt;&gt; when I was asked the question maybe the
[46:30] Lord doesn't want you to do that but I
[46:33] answered back no I believe it's the
[46:35] enemy trying to hinder Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; And Lord, then we see you work all these
[46:42] things out. How marvelous you are now,
[46:46] Lord.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; You see what we have needs of being
[46:50] worked out in our [music] spirit, Lord,
[46:53] or in our bodies.
[46:55] We're trusting you tonight, Lord,
[46:59] &gt;&gt; knowing this that you said everything
[47:02] [music]
[47:02] would work out to our good when we are
[47:07] called by you according to your purpose,
[47:10] Lord. [music]
[47:11] &gt;&gt; And we know that we are.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing]
[47:14] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name now. [music]
[47:16] Father, we commit the reading of the
[47:19] word,
[47:20] the service [music] into your hands for
[47:24] your glory and
[47:30] God bless you.
[47:33] If you want to turn in the scriptures
[47:36] with me
[47:38] in St. John 6
[47:44] and and I I'll just read two or three
[47:47] scriptures here
[47:50] and and then let you be seated. But
[47:53] we're starting here in St. John chapter
[47:57] 6 and verse 32.
[48:02] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[48:06] verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you
[48:11] not that bread from heaven, but my
[48:15] father giveth you the true bread from
[48:19] heaven."
[48:21] And if you notice our brother leading
[48:24] song,
[48:26] he ended with a song. Oh, where could I
[48:29] go? that align in that soul
[48:34] said, "But when my soul needs mana from
[48:38] above,"
[48:43] &gt;&gt; I I'm sorry, church. I'm just a little
[48:45] bit overjoyed.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Then in John chapter 15
[48:53] and verse one,
[48:57] St. John 15 and1
[49:04] I am
[49:06] the true vine. Now notice that first
[49:10] scripture said but my father giveth you
[49:14] the true bread from heaven. And now here
[49:17] the Lord says I am the true vine.
[49:22] Then in Hebrews chapter 9
[49:27] and verse 24
[49:38] Hebrews 9 and 24
[49:41] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[49:45] places made with hands
[49:49] which are figures
[49:52] of the true
[49:55] but into heaven itself now to appear in
[50:00] the presence of God
[50:02] &gt;&gt; for us. Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; And then in first John
[50:07] chapter 2
[50:10] and verse 8.
[50:15] First John 2
[50:18] and 8.
[50:20] Because the darkness is passed
[50:26] and the true light
[50:29] now shine.
[50:32] Let's just bow our heads again. Father,
[50:35] we thank you Lord for your word because
[50:38] we know that your words are life.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; And asking now, Lord, may you quicken
[50:46] these scriptures to us that they might
[50:49] become alive to us, Father.
[50:53] Let it be, oh God, as we commit these
[50:56] things to you now in the name of Jesus.
[51:02] God bless you. You could be seated.
[51:08] in
[51:10] seeing all these places here where the
[51:14] the Lord said that that he was the the
[51:18] true bread and that uh that
[51:24] in speaking of of Christ not entered
[51:27] into holy places made by hands, but but
[51:30] he said it was a figure of the truth.
[51:35] And then also the the true light. And I
[51:39] I I just like going back and seeing how
[51:44] that sometimes in our English
[51:47] translations
[51:49] uh that it it changes a little bit of
[51:52] the meaning. But I like to go back and
[51:55] see how it was intended in the original.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:00] and and in in seeing here the the
[52:03] strongs in looking at this word in in
[52:06] the Greek of how that it was uh written
[52:10] and I'm not a scholar in the Greek, but
[52:13] a lot of times I'll go back and look at
[52:15] that Greek dialogue that brother
[52:17] Brandham used because he uses it and it
[52:22] said it here in Strongs that that which
[52:26] has not only the name and a resemblance.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Let me stop right here for a second.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; We could have a name on something and it
[52:40] would look like something.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:44] Hey, you take the here tonight. If maybe
[52:48] if I had a a a a Chevrolet Corvette
[52:55] and I told you, I want to sell you this
[52:58] Corvette for a very good price.
[53:01] And you would look at it and you you'd
[53:04] say, "Oh, yes. This is I I know what
[53:06] they look like.
[53:09] This is a Corvette."
[53:12] And I I tell you what, sit down in the
[53:14] seat and it's got Corvette seats in it.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; But when you start it up and take off,
[53:24] it won't hardly move.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; And you stop and you look under the hood
[53:30] and it's got a lawnmower engine in it.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; You'd be real disappointed with me.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; And you'd say, "Brother Farmer, this is
[53:40] not a Corvette. It's a lawn mower.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; It looks like it.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; But it's powered with a lawnmower
[53:46] engine. When I start it up, it sounds
[53:49] like the kid next door mowing his yard
[53:53] &gt;&gt; because it has a resemblance.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; And it has a name.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; But it's not Virginia.
[54:03] [applause]
[54:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:08] It's not only the name and resemblance,
[54:13] but the real nature
[54:16] &gt;&gt; that's corresponding to the name.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; If it had the name of Corvette, it's got
[54:24] the na a racing name behind it and you
[54:28] expect it to drive like a racing car.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Not like a lawnmower.
[54:40] Are you hearing me?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; But
[54:46] in every respect,
[54:50] &gt;&gt; it corresponds to the idea
[54:53] signified
[54:56] by the name
[54:58] &gt;&gt; real, true, and genuine.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; God.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; In the Philadelphiaian church age,
[55:15] we find the prophet of God looking at
[55:18] this same word,
[55:21] the the true vine.
[55:26] Since this word indeed expresses
[55:31] perfect realization
[55:35] and I'd like to say we've gone beyond
[55:38] perfect realization. That's right.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; But gone into perfect revelation. Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; But it's this word true is separating
[55:50] from a partial revelation or a partial
[55:54] realization
[55:56] and shows there's a difference because
[55:59] the true is a perfect
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Realization and a perfect
[56:06] &gt;&gt; revelation.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:11] As illustrated in these verses, we can
[56:15] now understand as never before the
[56:19] anti-ype
[56:21] contrasted with the type
[56:25] and substance.
[56:28] How many believes the Lord Jesus is
[56:30] substance tonight?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; The word of God is substance compared to
[56:36] a shadow
[56:38] &gt;&gt; of substance.
[56:42] Take for example now the mana from
[56:45] heaven. God sent down angel bread from
[56:49] heaven for Israel. But that bread did
[56:52] not satisfy. It was only good for a day.
[56:56] They went out six days a week to pick up
[56:59] mana.
[57:02] on on the uh the sixth day, they would
[57:04] get enough for the two days, but they
[57:07] couldn't keep it any longer than two
[57:10] days. If they tried to get enough for
[57:12] all week, it wound up having maggots in
[57:15] it, which was not only a type of that
[57:18] mana, but it was also a type of the
[57:21] church ages of how that you couldn't
[57:24] take what was picked up for the Ephesian
[57:26] age and try to carry it on over into the
[57:29] next age. Neither can we take what was
[57:33] there for the Pentecostal.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Because we have gone beyond that.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; We couldn't take what was for the
[57:45] Lutheran age
[57:47] &gt;&gt; and try to exist on that manner.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Because we see that that has has over
[57:53] the time
[57:55] man.
[57:58] It's not been bugs in it, but it's been
[58:00] man.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; That has corrupted it because they added
[58:05] their creeds to this or to that or to
[58:08] something else or they tried to
[58:11] denominate to where that everybody had
[58:14] to say it just like I said or they had
[58:16] to look at it just like I look at it.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:23] We do that in divide up fellowship that
[58:26] we can't even rejoice and praise God
[58:29] with one another.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; God sent down angel bread from heaven
[58:40] for Israel. But that bread did not
[58:44] satisfy. It was only good for a day.
[58:47] Those who ate it were hungry again the
[58:50] next day.
[58:52] If it was left around, it become
[58:54] contaminated.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; But Jesus is the true bread from heaven.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Whereof mana was just a type.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And if any man eats of that bread that
[59:10] came down from heaven, he'll never
[59:13] hunger again.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need to come back. We don't
[59:17] have to come back and and repent all
[59:20] over again. We don't have to lay down a
[59:23] foundation again. It's already been
[59:26] laid.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] The moment he parttook,
[59:38] &gt;&gt; the moment he parttook,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; he had eternal life.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; He recognized it.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Now, we always did have eternal life.
[59:57] Yeah.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; If you are a son or a daughter of God,
[1:00:02] now you always was a son and a daughter
[1:00:06] of God. We have the same testimony that
[1:00:10] God asked Job to respond to. Where were
[1:00:14] you?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; When I laid the when the sons of God
[1:00:20] shouted for joy.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I've I've witnessed
[1:00:26] about me first meeting brother Juan to
[1:00:30] to many people.
[1:00:32] He had uh had told me what gate that he
[1:00:36] would be in when I had flown up here.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; And he was going to pick me up and and
[1:00:44] I'd never seen brother Juan before. I'd
[1:00:46] never seen a picture of him.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; It was just somebody I'd talked to on
[1:00:52] the phone.
[1:00:55] And I came out the gate and when I
[1:00:58] looked up and down that line, there was
[1:01:00] 75 or 100 cars
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; waiting on people.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; And somebody's here to pick me up that's
[1:01:08] never seen me and I've never seen him.
[1:01:12] And I just came out the door and started
[1:01:15] walking up this way. Got up about three
[1:01:18] cars and something says turn and go
[1:01:21] back. Hallelujah.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And I turned around and I went back and
[1:01:25] I believe it was a second car
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; from where I had started.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; I looked over in the car. There was a
[1:01:33] black brother that was sitting in there.
[1:01:36] I just walked up to the car, opened the
[1:01:38] door, and said, "Brother Juan,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother."
[1:01:44] [applause]
[1:01:47] [cheering]
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And we knew each other instantly.
[1:01:51] But I knew that IT WAS BECAUSE THAT
[1:01:54] SOMEWHERE back there, I don't remember
[1:01:57] when it was, but we had fellowship
[1:02:00] together.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Awesome.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; To get around people and just talk to
[1:02:07] them for a few minutes. Here a year ago,
[1:02:11] we were down at Springfield, Illinois. A
[1:02:14] brother and sister
[1:02:17] had invited me into their home. We we
[1:02:20] was trying to help out a a family down
[1:02:22] there that uh the mother was was going
[1:02:25] through a a time of crisis and I just
[1:02:28] had it on my heart to go up and and and
[1:02:32] to have a house meeting with them. She
[1:02:34] couldn't get to church, but we took
[1:02:36] church to her.
[1:02:39] [applause]
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; And brother West and his wife just so
[1:02:42] graciously
[1:02:44] asked me to come in. And she was
[1:02:47] apologizing
[1:02:48] today for not taking care of me. The
[1:02:52] perfect host and hostess.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sir.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; The scripture says it.
[1:03:01] the way you treat one another, the way
[1:03:03] you treated me. I know how you love God.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; That's awesome.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; But it's because that we go back.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; I've lost my place here.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; It's okay.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] He does not need to come back and eat
[1:03:31] again. The moment he parttook, he had
[1:03:35] eternal life. Here indeed was reality.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; No need any longer for a shadow.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; If you don't know what my hand looks
[1:03:53] like,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; you could look at the shadow
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; of my hand.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; But when the hand appears,
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; you no longer need to rely on the
[1:04:05] shadow.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; the shadow is only the type,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; But the hand is the substance
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; that's there that the shadow is only
[1:04:24] making an image because of this.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; No need. Now remember the true is the
[1:04:36] separation of the complete
[1:04:41] versus a partial.
[1:04:46] No need for a partial salvation.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, Israel would come
[1:04:54] down and every year they would offer a
[1:04:57] sacrifice and you've heard it preached
[1:05:00] on so many times of how that they would
[1:05:04] stand back and look and the family would
[1:05:06] be watching as daddy would take in a
[1:05:09] sacrifice and and they would put it on
[1:05:12] the fire and and the way that they was
[1:05:15] taught was that if that smoke just went
[1:05:19] straight up.
[1:05:25] You was an outcast for a year.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; But if that smoke went up and the hand
[1:05:32] of God took it and pulled it,
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; then God had accepted it.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. My sins are gone.
[1:05:43] [applause]
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; For one year.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; They had a partial
[1:05:49] salvation.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; For one year or their sins was pushed
[1:05:54] forward for a year.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Next year they go through the same
[1:06:00] thing. Oh Lord, am I good enough? Are
[1:06:03] you going to accept my sacrifice?
[1:06:06] Have I done everything just right. Is
[1:06:09] there something that I've missed?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; And they're waiting to see if that smoke
[1:06:15] is accepted of God.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; All my sins are gone for a year.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; But now though,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Now though,
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. that was done away with because
[1:06:33] that was only a shadow of the real
[1:06:36] salvation of the full salvation of the
[1:06:40] complete
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; that when the Lord Jesus hanging on the
[1:06:45] cross could say it is finished
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; it was done
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; it was done
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I'd like to take from this
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; a subject for just a few minutes of a
[1:07:02] total
[1:07:04] deliverance.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; A total deliverance,
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; not a partial deliverance.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. On the tape in 1959 of a
[1:07:16] total deliverance. Uh we brother said we
[1:07:20] want complete deliverance. We don't want
[1:07:23] to be a halfway church.
[1:07:27] We want to be a real church
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; or no church at all.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; We want to be real Christians or no
[1:07:37] Christians at all. We want total
[1:07:41] deliverance from our habits from our
[1:07:44] sin,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; from our evil thinking,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; from our evil doing
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; from our negligence. Yes sir.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; there are sins of commission,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Things we do
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; and there are sins of omission
[1:08:10] when the Lord just nudges you a little
[1:08:13] bit.
[1:08:15] Force you need to do this.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I I I'll do it. And then we
[1:08:21] get busy.
[1:08:24] That's right.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; We let everyday life just come in on top
[1:08:28] of us and the Well, I I've got to do
[1:08:31] this. Uh oh, I've got to pay these
[1:08:34] bills. Oh, I've got to get gas so that I
[1:08:37] I can go to church tomorrow.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And what the Lord told me that I needed
[1:08:44] to do,
[1:08:48] I forget.
[1:08:53] Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; From our negligence.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Go to bed at night. You Oh, Lord. I was
[1:09:07] going to call that brother. You laid him
[1:09:09] on my heart.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe y'all don't do that.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; But I do.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] Lord,
[1:09:23] I I I could tell you something else, but
[1:09:25] it it it take too long to go into it,
[1:09:30] but I I I had a time I I I'll go into it
[1:09:34] a little bit.
[1:09:37] There was a a prophecy that was given. A
[1:09:40] sister went in the back room and wrote
[1:09:42] it down. Took it and give it to the
[1:09:44] pastor. And he had three men to judge
[1:09:47] it. And all three of them said the same
[1:09:50] thing. I don't know who it's talking
[1:09:53] about, but it's of God.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And
[1:10:04] the pastor had had told us about it
[1:10:11] and three or four and uh
[1:10:16] uh He said uh it said actually what was
[1:10:22] written
[1:10:23] was one is a bleeding lamb the other
[1:10:29] dressed in wool
[1:10:32] and uh brother David said
[1:10:36] our pastor he said it said that they're
[1:10:39] both sheep and I thought no
[1:10:43] that's not what he said
[1:10:46] Brother David doesn't read very well.
[1:10:52] I went home that night.
[1:10:54] I I
[1:10:56] four or five hours.
[1:10:58] The only thing I could ever find and
[1:11:01] dressed in wool was a wolf in sheep's
[1:11:05] clothing.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And I thought, man, I've I've got to
[1:11:10] tell brother D.
[1:11:12] And uh
[1:11:15] I got busy
[1:11:19] and I forgot.
[1:11:23] And about two weeks later, he said, "You
[1:11:26] know, we had that prophecy that the
[1:11:28] sister wrote down and and it was judged
[1:11:31] that it was of God."
[1:11:33] He said, "And uh I thought I didn't tell
[1:11:38] him
[1:11:43] You talk about dilemma. You don't know
[1:11:46] whether to disrupt church service or
[1:11:48] what. And I went over to the guitar and
[1:11:51] I sat down. I thought, Lord, if you'll
[1:11:53] let me live till the end of this
[1:11:56] service, I won't forget this time. And
[1:11:59] as soon as a he dismissed service,
[1:12:02] normally we'd sit there and play for
[1:12:04] another five minutes or something till
[1:12:06] everybody has exited out.
[1:12:10] Not this time. I wretched over and
[1:12:12] turned my amplifier off. I went in the
[1:12:14] back room. I said, "Brother, I need to
[1:12:16] talk to you."
[1:12:18] He said, "What is it?" I I said, "You
[1:12:21] said that both of those were sheep." He
[1:12:26] said, "Yeah." He said, "That's what it
[1:12:28] said." I said, "But it didn't say that."
[1:12:31] He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "It
[1:12:33] said that one was a bleeding lamb, the
[1:12:36] other dressed in wool.
[1:12:39] And he said it didn't I said brother it
[1:12:42] did that's what you read to me and and
[1:12:44] he said here he said you know I don't
[1:12:47] read good said you read it to me and I
[1:12:51] read it to him and it was just that way
[1:12:55] and he said oh my I said brother David I
[1:12:58] knew I was supposed to told you about
[1:13:00] this two weeks ago. I said, "But I I I
[1:13:03] went home uh uh went through every quote
[1:13:06] I could find,
[1:13:10] but when you brought it up today, I knew
[1:13:12] I had to tell you right now." He said,
[1:13:15] "Thank you so much."
[1:13:18] [clears throat]
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; That answers a lot of questions for me.
[1:13:21] And he knew then what it was and how to
[1:13:24] deal with it.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; See, when God comes on the scene and God
[1:13:33] speaks, you don't have to worry about
[1:13:35] whether it's right or wrong because the
[1:13:38] Lord has never been wrong.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; We don't need a when
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; when that which is perfect has come,
[1:13:48] that which was done in part was done
[1:13:51] away with. Yes.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; He understood it one way, but when it
[1:13:57] was made plain,
[1:14:00] he didn't need what was misunderstood.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Because here's the the actual
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; laying there rather than looking at the
[1:14:11] shadow of it. Do you understand there
[1:14:14] what I'm saying?
[1:14:22] No need for partial salvation. Here is
[1:14:27] the whole of it. Just like Jesus isn't a
[1:14:31] part of God, he is God.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Here at home this past week, one of the
[1:14:38] tapes that I listened to was Victory
[1:14:41] Day. And on it, Brother Brandham was
[1:14:43] telling a story about that they was out
[1:14:47] somewhere and and a brother handed him
[1:14:49] his binoculars and the binoculars was
[1:14:53] set for the brother. But when the
[1:14:55] prophet of God put it up, he saw three
[1:14:58] analopee instead of one.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; But the brother had told him there's one
[1:15:03] analopee. And he said, "Well, because I
[1:15:06] knew there was one because that's what
[1:15:08] the brother had said. But I was seeing
[1:15:11] three. He said, "Isn't that just about
[1:15:14] what people's done with water baptism?"
[1:15:16] That's
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Instead of the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:20] Christ, they see three. Oh, but praise
[1:15:24] God that we had a prophet that knew how
[1:15:26] to dial in the binoculars. [applause]
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAD ALREADY SENT
[1:15:35] A MAN by the name of PAUL THAT HAD
[1:15:38] DIALED IN the binoculars in his day.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; That they were baptizing in the name of
[1:15:45] the Lord Jesus.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; A total deliverance.
[1:15:57] We want total deliverance
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; so that when people come into this
[1:16:02] church to be prayed for.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; There'll be just this little group,
[1:16:09] maybe not over a hundred or two sitting
[1:16:12] here,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; but they'll be completely
[1:16:17] in the hands of God.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And when we pray, then God will hear
[1:16:23] from heaven. Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; God wants somebody that he can hold in
[1:16:29] his hand.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody that he can say, "I've got
[1:16:34] confidence.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I can send this my sick servant to the
[1:16:40] Brandon Tabernacle at Jeffersonville."
[1:16:43] And that group of people are in one
[1:16:45] accord.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Not one thought
[1:16:50] over here and another and here and
[1:16:52] another and over here.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; But in one accord
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; many people
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; but in one accord.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Something will happen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Something will happen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; I believe it's happening right now.
[1:17:17] Hallelujah.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; I tell people, we're not divided.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; When you're hurting up here in
[1:17:24] Minneapolis, we hurt with you in
[1:17:26] Arkansas.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; When I heard that Sister Dall had to uh
[1:17:35] Brother Juan had called me up and said
[1:17:38] that she had to go into the hospital
[1:17:41] there.
[1:17:43] What's it been a couple weeks ago? CS
[1:17:46] We went to prayer.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Because we bear one another's
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; burden.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; When you're hurting, we hurt. When we're
[1:17:57] hurting down there, you hurt up here.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; But why? Because it's the love that we
[1:18:04] have. Then as part of the body is
[1:18:07] hurting, the rest of the body
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; will compensate.
[1:18:15] That's right.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You bruise up one foot,
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; the rest of the body will take up the
[1:18:26] pressure
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; that that one foot
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; can't take.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Because it's hurting too bad.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's just more of the
[1:18:42] manifestation
[1:18:43] of the characteristics
[1:18:46] of God.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; A total deliverance.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And God identifying himself by his
[1:18:58] characteristics. The prophet of God in
[1:19:01] paragraph 34 it reads like this. And
[1:19:04] this God raised up a prophet named
[1:19:07] Moses. And the man was taught in all the
[1:19:11] wisdom of the Egyptians and no doubt but
[1:19:15] he was a great smart intellectual man.
[1:19:20] He could teach the Egyptians wisdom.
[1:19:23] Looked like a proper fit fitted man for
[1:19:27] deliverance.
[1:19:29] But you see what we call deliverance
[1:19:34] and what God calls deliverance
[1:19:39] is some difference.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody comes up to the altar and a a a
[1:19:52] newcomer might come in amongst us and
[1:19:55] and he says, "Preacher, I I need
[1:19:58] deliverance."
[1:20:01] and what he's got in mind that he needs
[1:20:04] to give up the smoking habit because his
[1:20:07] daddy died of lung cancer.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And we think,
[1:20:16] oh, if he gives up smoking,
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; but that's just a partial deliver.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; That's not a total deliver. But when
[1:20:25] something gets down INSIDE THE SOUL OF
[1:20:29] THAT MAN, then he's no longer the same.
[1:20:32] [applause] And it's not that I refuse to
[1:20:35] smoke a cigarette, but there's nothing
[1:20:38] in here that's craving for that. That's
[1:20:41] a total deliverance. [cheering]
[1:20:45] Then instead of craving after a nicotine
[1:20:48] habit, IT'S CRAVING FOR MORE and more
[1:20:52] and more of God until it's totally
[1:20:55] filled
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; a total deliverance.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; We're not content
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; to see people get a partial deliver.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:21:12] Do we have to preach a closline
[1:21:14] religion?
[1:21:16] Yes, we do. You remind the people, and
[1:21:19] sometimes there's newcomers that come in
[1:21:22] that maybe they haven't heard it, or or
[1:21:25] maybe it's somebody that they've heard
[1:21:27] it before, but they just let the cares
[1:21:31] of life choke them out.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; You remember the parable of the seeds?
[1:21:38] Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Some of them fell there among briars and
[1:21:43] and it just choked them out and and jobs
[1:21:47] choke us out and and and finances just
[1:21:52] choke us out.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; We don't need somebody to come by with a
[1:22:00] weed eater and just trim back a little
[1:22:03] bit.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:22:05] We need somebody to come through and dig
[1:22:08] out the root
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; of what's choking us out.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And that surgical sword of the Lord
[1:22:15] Jesus knows just exactly how to do it.
[1:22:19] And it don't miss nothing. The doctor
[1:22:22] MIGHT GO IN AND CUT out a disease, but
[1:22:26] he may not get all the roots of it out.
[1:22:29] But I want you to know that that same
[1:22:31] disease in the presence of almighty God,
[1:22:35] it is annihilated.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Total deliverance.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Listen to to brother Brandham talking
[1:22:44] about of how that the doctors give a man
[1:22:48] up. He said, "Oh, but five minutes in
[1:22:52] the presence of God and it was
[1:22:55] finished."
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] a great smart intellectual man. He could
[1:23:10] teach the Egyptians wisdom. Looked like
[1:23:13] a proper fit man for deliverance.
[1:23:18] And then he said, "But you see what we
[1:23:20] call deliverance and what God calls
[1:23:24] deliverance is something else."
[1:23:28] With all of his wisdom, with all of his
[1:23:31] military training, the only thing that
[1:23:34] Moses could do in that realm of his life
[1:23:37] is kill one Egyptian and get run out of
[1:23:40] town.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] Now watch this man with all of his
[1:23:50] ethics. He knowed that he was born to
[1:23:54] deliver the children of Israel. Yet with
[1:23:57] all of his education, that's all he
[1:24:00] knowed about. And knowing that he was
[1:24:03] called of God to do a job, he had all of
[1:24:07] his he had his bachelor of art and his
[1:24:11] PhD and his doubleld and so forth. And
[1:24:15] he went out to deliver Israel and was a
[1:24:20] total
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; failure.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Failure.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; The right man
[1:24:29] sure was
[1:24:32] commission on his life. Sure did.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; But he hadn't come face to face with
[1:24:39] that pillar of fire yet.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But I want you to notice
[1:24:45] after the Lord had taken 40 years now to
[1:24:50] get all of Egypt out of him. I think
[1:24:52] that's what we need to do is lay in the
[1:24:55] presence of the son and let him take all
[1:24:58] of Egypt out of us. Think all the
[1:25:01] worldliness out of us.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; TAKE ALL THE INDIFFERENCE out of us.
[1:25:06] That when the word of God comes to us
[1:25:08] that you can't hold us down.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, we just uh met up with some people
[1:25:17] here uh this past uh uh last week
[1:25:23] preaching a funeral for a a a Christian
[1:25:27] gentleman that died four days short of
[1:25:32] his 100th birthday.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Character.
[1:25:40] Character.
[1:25:42] World War II vet.
[1:25:46] Are you following me?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Had two bronze stars for bravery
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; in battle.
[1:25:56] His family found out about it last week
[1:26:00] when the military
[1:26:02] sent his war records.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; He never made mention of it.
[1:26:11] Or you you take some halfbaked
[1:26:13] politician, they brag about what they
[1:26:15] didn't do.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Hello. But here's a real man.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; That he's been there. He's done that.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I made mention of it in his funeral. I
[1:26:27] said a man with enough courage that he
[1:26:30] was one of them that kicked down the
[1:26:32] doors on the prison camp that he had for
[1:26:35] the Jews that Hitler had in Germany.
[1:26:40] And yet so humble
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; that awarded two bronze stars and his
[1:26:46] own family.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Oh God help me to be humble. Yes.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; You know, we we get talking to your
[1:26:55] pastor while over lunch today. He'd
[1:26:59] taken me out to eat a little bit and and
[1:27:01] and
[1:27:06] I I told him of a thing that a I'd heard
[1:27:10] that a a man that was a teacher at a
[1:27:13] seminary had a a list of names of of
[1:27:18] students that he had that had walked
[1:27:20] away from the Lord.
[1:27:23] And when he was trying to to uh compare
[1:27:26] the names and uh were they from the same
[1:27:29] family? No. Were they from the same
[1:27:31] state? No. He could only find one common
[1:27:36] thread.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; But they were all proud.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; God protect us from
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; not ever. Let's glorify the Lord. Yes.
[1:27:52] But whenever it points back to the man,
[1:27:55] don't do that. You'll only [applause]
[1:27:57] lift up somebody.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Praise
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; all of his training.
[1:28:05] But when he come back after the Lord had
[1:28:08] done a work in his life
[1:28:12] and he trimmed this off of Moses.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; And
[1:28:18] you sisters, you're just going to have
[1:28:20] to forgive me. But brother Brandham said
[1:28:22] that, you know, his Moses's wife Zapora
[1:28:26] had a temper and and Moses had a temper,
[1:28:29] too.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; And said, I imagine it wasn't too
[1:28:33] pleasant sometimes back there on the
[1:28:35] back side of
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Like two brick walls fighting with each
[1:28:48] other.
[1:28:49] Ain't neither one of them going to move
[1:28:51] whether I'm right. No, I'm right. No,
[1:28:54] I'm
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; God's got a way of
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I heard somebody say something here not
[1:29:10] too long ago said, you know, after all
[1:29:13] of that arguing and fussing and then
[1:29:15] when Moses met the pillar of fire, God
[1:29:17] told him said, "Take your shoes off."
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; How many times have us men heard that
[1:29:23] when we come tracking him? But
[1:29:29] no, you know what? It was the only thing
[1:29:32] between Moses and holy ground was his
[1:29:35] shoes.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; So he had to get rid of everything so it
[1:29:41] was just him and holy ground.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; But but a after God had stripped all of
[1:29:48] that kind of junk off of him and had to
[1:29:52] cut this off and that off and something
[1:29:54] else off and this
[1:29:58] pride had to go.
[1:30:02] all of his military training.
[1:30:06] The man that could stand before Pharaoh
[1:30:11] and even be a spokesman for Pharaoh.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Now has a stutter and can't talk.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; But God had him in condition.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Right?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; He got him humbled down where he could
[1:30:32] use him.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Where he didn't think that he was
[1:30:36] something
[1:30:38] and instead he'd even argue with God to
[1:30:41] go down
[1:30:43] to Egypt.
[1:30:45] Lord, how can I I I I I I I I
[1:30:49] can't even talk.
[1:30:52] I'll give you your brother to be your
[1:30:55] mouthpiece.
[1:30:58] What's in your hand?
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Wasn't thinking about that earlier, s
[1:31:03] but there it is.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Cast it down.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Now pick it back up again.
[1:31:13] A snake.
[1:31:15] Me pick it up. Pick it up.
[1:31:19] When he did turn back to the rock.
[1:31:27] Now he's got him word. He's listening to
[1:31:32] God
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; and he's obeying
[1:31:36] God
[1:31:39] because now
[1:31:41] he knows God.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; He'd heard about God when he was just a
[1:31:47] little baby. His mama whispered into his
[1:31:49] ear, "You're going to be the deliverer.
[1:31:51] Jehovah is the one. You're in his
[1:31:54] hands." when when all the rest of the
[1:31:57] little babies your size was killed, but
[1:32:00] God was keeping you aside for the
[1:32:02] service.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; He had heard it.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; But now he's hearing it for the first
[1:32:12] time.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; That when God speaks that he can listen.
[1:32:18] And now he goes back and remember he
[1:32:20] didn't have the Bible like you and I
[1:32:22] have.
[1:32:23] He didn't have the message like you and
[1:32:26] I've got 1,200 tapes.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; But what he had was the word of God that
[1:32:32] said, "Let my people go." And that was
[1:32:35] all that he had need.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. GOD ALWAYS SUPPLIES his
[1:32:41] people. That whatever we have need of
[1:32:44] that he's given. When you get the HOLY
[1:32:47] GHOST, YOU'VE GOT everything that you
[1:32:49] need for the life. [cheering]
[1:32:51] [applause]
[1:32:52] We've already got say, "Oh, I I need I
[1:32:56] need this. I need that. I need this. I
[1:32:58] need that." No, you just need to lay
[1:33:01] down your doubts.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; God's already given it to you.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:22] You know, Moses told Pharaoh,
[1:33:27] he said, "We're going to go out on the
[1:33:29] desert and worship."
[1:33:37] And the devil
[1:33:39] through Pharaoh
[1:33:42] was trying to make a deal.
[1:33:49] He says, "Well, if you want to go out,
[1:33:54] go ahead,
[1:33:56] but leave.
[1:33:58] Leave your wives.
[1:34:01] Leave your children
[1:34:04] in Egypt.
[1:34:08] You can go meet with God,
[1:34:11] but you got to leave all of your
[1:34:13] inheritance.
[1:34:16] You got to leave your flocks
[1:34:19] here with me for ransom.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; That man, he didn't have a manage
[1:34:28] anointing. He didn't have an eagle age
[1:34:31] anointing. He didn't need it. All he had
[1:34:33] was the words that God had spoke to him.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, we're going to take
[1:34:40] our sons. We're going to take our
[1:34:43] daughters. We're going to take our
[1:34:46] flocks. We're going to take our herds.
[1:34:49] And we ain't even leaving a stinking
[1:34:52] hoof behind.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; I think that the church of THE LIVING
[1:34:59] GOD, WE'RE TO HAVE THAT SAME commandment
[1:35:02] tonight. No devil, we ain't giving you
[1:35:06] our kids. No, devil, we're not giving
[1:35:09] you our worship.
[1:35:13] Not one little bit.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; It's time, church, that we put our foot
[1:35:24] down of the head of the
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; devil.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; In our lowest place,
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; our position is still over the enemy.
[1:35:38] Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; No matter how low that we get, no matter
[1:35:43] how beat down,
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord,
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; that a son of God is, there's still a
[1:35:49] son or a daughter of God.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Our position.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Satan longs for your position,
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; He wanted He wanted
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; worship.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:15] I ain't never thought of this before.
[1:36:22] Can you imagine how turned inside out
[1:36:25] that the devil is every time that one
[1:36:29] child of God recognizes his position
[1:36:33] because all the angels are saying and
[1:36:36] Satan couldn't get them to do that for
[1:36:38] him.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what he was longing after.
[1:36:43] That's what he fell on.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:50] want your position.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And too many times
[1:36:58] we let it just go over the top of our
[1:37:00] head
[1:37:02] and just because the enemy whispers
[1:37:04] something in our ear,
[1:37:07] we might even start agreeing with him.
[1:37:11] No, church, don't even give place.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:19] I may get into just a little something
[1:37:22] here that brother Juan may w want to
[1:37:24] come behind me and correct me and that's
[1:37:26] fine. That that's what he can do.
[1:37:31] But I've had people to come and tell me,
[1:37:33] "Oh, brother Farmer, you need to go look
[1:37:35] at believe the sign and see what they're
[1:37:38] saying so that you know how to stand
[1:37:40] against it." No, I don't need to give
[1:37:44] place to the enemy.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. I don't need that.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; I don't need it, father.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Put down
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; the things of darkness. I don't need to
[1:37:58] go and see what they're saying.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I don't need to listen to rock music,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; So that I know what I need to be playing
[1:38:07] in church.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; I don't have to listen to it.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I was talking to somebody here just the
[1:38:19] other day. I said, "Why in the world are
[1:38:22] people trying to go in their worship? Do
[1:38:25] you know why they set up a smoke
[1:38:27] machine?
[1:38:31] They'll have their blue lights and red
[1:38:33] lights and and and got a smoke machine
[1:38:36] going where it looks smoky in there."
[1:38:39] Well, you know, I've seen that presence
[1:38:42] before.
[1:38:44] The night Anna got the Holy Ghost,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; we was in there in the living room
[1:38:49] praying and we got we thought that we
[1:38:52] were done and my daughter just didn't
[1:38:55] want to quit and mama got on one side of
[1:38:58] her and I was on the other and she said,
[1:39:00] "Honey, so have you got what you need?"
[1:39:03] And she just started crying and I said,
[1:39:05] "Boys, we ain't done yet.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The light was on in the kitchen and
[1:39:12] about 45 minutes or however long that it
[1:39:15] was after. Sometimes you lose all track
[1:39:19] of time. I just love getting lost in the
[1:39:22] presence of almighty God where he is.
[1:39:26] And we ain't worried about time. We
[1:39:29] ain't worried about this and something
[1:39:31] else.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; But when we got done,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. She had broke through.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And looking into the kitchen, it looked
[1:39:46] like it was just filled up with fog or
[1:39:49] smoke.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; I've seen it two or three times since
[1:39:54] then. Yes.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; But because the world can't produce
[1:40:02] that,
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; they'll buy a little machine that it's
[1:40:07] kicking up some folk
[1:40:10] and they'll shine a light on it so that
[1:40:12] it looks like what was happening in the
[1:40:15] tabernacle when they was dedicating it
[1:40:18] and the shikina glory come down. But
[1:40:21] why? Why would the prophet of God MADE A
[1:40:25] STATEMENT? HE SAID, "Why would you
[1:40:28] accept something that's a false
[1:40:31] impersonation
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SKIES ARE FULL of Virginia
[1:40:37] wines?"
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I want to go and see how
[1:40:43] some mega church is conducting their
[1:40:46] pre-ervice
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; WHEN I'VE BEEN CALLED OUT OF THAT?
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; THE VOICE OF GOD TO THE BRIDE WAS COME
[1:40:56] OUT OF my
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; You don't belong there. That's right.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; You're an eagle. You don't belong in a
[1:41:04] chicken house.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I want to go back to
[1:41:08] clucking with the chickens?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Why?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I was in a place one time
[1:41:22] here. It's been 12, 15 years left. 15
[1:41:26] anyway.
[1:41:28] And I was back up in the mountains of
[1:41:30] Arkansas and I was doing a job and and I
[1:41:35] heard eagle scream
[1:41:37] and I got to looking and it's the only
[1:41:40] time that I've ever seen those eagles
[1:41:43] tied up in their mating
[1:41:47] ritual
[1:41:48] of how that he'll scream and then lock
[1:41:51] their claws together and just spiral
[1:41:55] down eyeballs like a David,
[1:41:59] I can't imagine an eagle getting up
[1:42:03] there and and dropping a big old limb
[1:42:06] and then just to show off to his
[1:42:08] sweetheart what he's capable of, he'll
[1:42:11] let that limb get down a hundred yards
[1:42:14] below him and then he'll sink going
[1:42:18] straight down in a nose dive and grab
[1:42:21] that stick and then bring it back up to
[1:42:23] show her what he got.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. has let go of it.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S AN EAGLE.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine that eagle getting up
[1:42:33] there and
[1:42:38] [laughter]
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; no, he ain't a chicken.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; He's an eagle.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; He ain't going to sound LIKE A CHICKEN.
[1:42:46] HE DON'T ACT LIKE A CHICKEN. He don't
[1:42:48] feed on chicken food.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Feed on eagle.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; He's got a total of limb.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; He's got something oh that he can be
[1:43:01] proud of up there.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; But you know, it seems like
[1:43:07] in this day and age,
[1:43:12] there's too many preachers preach too
[1:43:14] many churches
[1:43:17] that's preaching such a watered down
[1:43:19] version of the Bible.
[1:43:22] But Hebrews 13:8
[1:43:25] said Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:43:29] today, and forever.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; God hasn't changed.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; It's man and their systems that's
[1:43:37] changed.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; God's people ain't changed.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Glory. We're still We are still
[1:43:49] worshiping God
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] But it seems like it
[1:44:04] in too many ways,
[1:44:09] so many times that
[1:44:12] folks just looking more and more
[1:44:16] like the world.
[1:44:23] They're choosing to have a bigger crowd
[1:44:26] instead of having
[1:44:29] some oldfashioned
[1:44:31] heartfelt conviction.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; That would get down and say, "Lord, is
[1:44:38] it me?"
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; If somebody can't get healing in the
[1:44:42] church, Lord, is it me?
[1:44:46] Am I the one that's hindered? Now, y'all
[1:44:50] was shouting just a second ago.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; This is shouting material right here.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; See, because when I get me cleaned out,
[1:45:04] y'all remember the little story about
[1:45:07] it?
[1:45:09] a woman that was complaining about the
[1:45:11] neighbor's clothes being so dirty on the
[1:45:16] that was hanging up on the wash line.
[1:45:18] Finally, she had a belly full of it and
[1:45:21] she went down to tell that woman and
[1:45:25] said, "Aren't you embarrassed to be
[1:45:27] hanging dirty clothes out like this?"
[1:45:31] And she said, "Well, h said my clothes
[1:45:33] aren't dirty." and said, "I I seen
[1:45:36] them." And they went and looked and it
[1:45:39] was dirty. And she went back up and run
[1:45:44] a thumb across her window and her thumb
[1:45:47] was black.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:54] But maybe maybe it ain't
[1:46:00] maybe it ain't the preacher
[1:46:03] that's so mad, but it's me that I've
[1:46:05] just let some things come in and and and
[1:46:09] just cloud up my vision and it clouds up
[1:46:13] the way that I'm looking out at some
[1:46:15] things.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Hello. I believe it does us all real
[1:46:21] good just to have a good oldfashioned
[1:46:25] house cleaning sometime
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; and to say, "Oh Lord, it's me, oh Lord,
[1:46:31] standing in the need of prayer. Oh Lord,
[1:46:34] get me cleaned up."
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; We used to sing that song when the the
[1:46:42] coal of fire had touched the prophet.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:46] making him as pure as pure.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Then send me Lord.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:00] And you know, instead of preaching
[1:47:03] a total deliverance,
[1:47:06] I wonder if maybe we've got in a habit
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; of just
[1:47:14] managing unbelief.
[1:47:17] Yeah.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; You know, you take somebody that's got a
[1:47:20] drinking problem
[1:47:23] and and they refuse to go down to an
[1:47:25] altar, but they'll go down to a deal
[1:47:28] called alcoholic synonymous.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And you know what? They'll have them to
[1:47:34] say, "I'm a recovering alcoholic."
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; But what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[1:47:45] limit how much I drink,
[1:47:51] manage them.
[1:47:55] Are you hearing me? Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Somebody comes up with a problem and you
[1:48:00] say, "Well, but uh uh brother, you don't
[1:48:02] do it as much as you used to. Oh, you're
[1:48:06] fine. Just come on in. Just put some
[1:48:09] money in the offering. Just keep paying
[1:48:12] your tithes." No, it's not all right. It
[1:48:15] is somebody that is under bondage that
[1:48:19] needs a deliverance.
[1:48:23] needs a total deliverance. We don't need
[1:48:26] to slow down.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I heard a a a man speaking.
[1:48:34] Some of y'all may even know who it is
[1:48:37] because it was a message preacher
[1:48:39] somewhere that said that he would go
[1:48:41] around to to some of the youth meetings
[1:48:45] and just anonymously he would hand out
[1:48:49] these uh papers for them to to look at
[1:48:53] and to write down. and said that 90%
[1:48:59] of most of the young men
[1:49:02] were addicted
[1:49:04] to pornography
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; because of their phone
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; and 60%
[1:49:16] of the girls
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; at message youth camp.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Yeah.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And the brother said, "And in some
[1:49:27] assemblies
[1:49:29] it was 100% of the boys.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; I ain't content with that."
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "I ain't content with that."
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And yet they'll have them playing music.
[1:49:45] They'll have them singing.
[1:49:49] They'll have them doing this or that.
[1:49:51] What we need to do first is to get our
[1:49:54] life cleaned up.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's get them to Christ.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's good to get them in church.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; But it's that's not the finished work.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Could we just use the Lord Jesus as an
[1:50:10] example? I believe he's a wonderful one
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; to use as an example, don't you?
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:22] Calvary
[1:50:24] was not the resurrection.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:50:35] No, Calvary was not the resurrection.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:42] You know, the
[1:50:46] the word had to be fulfilled.
[1:50:49] And if the word said that he would lay
[1:50:51] in there for three days, that had to be
[1:50:54] accomplished.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; And you know what? While the Lord Jesus
[1:50:58] was in the tomb, they had wrapped him up
[1:51:02] in the the grave clothes.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; I I heard a singer one time that that in
[1:51:12] the song said the winding clothes that
[1:51:15] they wrapped him in.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; But when that stone was rolled away,
[1:51:22] those clothes were laid aside. He didn't
[1:51:24] have any more needs for them. But I want
[1:51:27] you to know tonight that there's many a
[1:51:30] people that they may be still IN THEIR
[1:51:32] TOMB OF UNBELIEF and besetting sins.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to stay in there.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Your time has been accomplished when the
[1:51:47] angel has come and rolled away the stone
[1:51:51] and told you that you can go free. You
[1:51:54] don't have TO STAY IN THERE. You can
[1:51:57] take off ALL OF THOSE GRAVE clothes and
[1:52:00] leave them behind and walk out in
[1:52:03] victory the same way that the Lord.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; A total victory.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not content with sin. are the young
[1:52:16] people that are struggling with this and
[1:52:20] struggling with that and struggling with
[1:52:22] something else.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; But I want to see them get delivered.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care how long that it takes.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; If we have to pray with them all night,
[1:52:36] you know, in the upper room,
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; all night. in the upper room.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; They had been up there for several days.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; And we hear the prophet of God that he's
[1:52:51] diagraming what had happened up there
[1:52:54] and said, "Well, Peter, I think we've
[1:52:56] been up here long enough, don't you?"
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Peter looked at and said, "Until?"
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Until.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Until."
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Until what?
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:11] We're endued with power.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; And they just went to praying,
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; seeking the Lord again.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It may not even
[1:53:21] happen the next day.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; But one day it did happen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when it happened, they came
[1:53:30] out and they was no longer the same
[1:53:33] people that was went into the upper
[1:53:35] room, but men that was ashamed to to say
[1:53:40] that they had even been with JESUS WAS
[1:53:42] NOW STANDING OUT ON THE STREET corner
[1:53:45] proclaiming when they come up and made
[1:53:48] fun of him and said, "Oh, y'all are
[1:53:50] drunk." He said, "We're drunk." All
[1:53:53] right. But it's not
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; proposed, [applause]
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; This is that that Joel spoke of when he
[1:54:02] said that your young men, your young
[1:54:05] women, I pour OUT MY SPIRIT ON ALL
[1:54:08] FLESH.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; They were the manifestation.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Of overcoming.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; He wasn't ashamed of it no more.
[1:54:20] You didn't have to worry about Junior
[1:54:22] reccombing his hair when he went to
[1:54:24] school.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You know, there's just something about
[1:54:28] conviction.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Sister Carlin said, "Here, I
[1:54:36] fond memory of that day,
[1:54:41] but we was out there at your house.
[1:54:42] Brother Scotty had come by to pick me up
[1:54:44] at the motel. We was going to have
[1:54:47] breakfast over there at their house. And
[1:54:52] her brother, a doctor,
[1:54:56] he thinks he's Presbyterian. He ain't no
[1:54:58] more Presbyterian now.
[1:55:05] He'd had his truck in the shop several
[1:55:07] days before and they changed out a fuel
[1:55:10] pump on it. and and uh he come over and
[1:55:14] his niece had come up from down at at
[1:55:18] Manchester, Tennessee uh uh for the
[1:55:21] meetings and and so he come over to to
[1:55:24] visit Sister Carlin and and his niece
[1:55:27] and and he gets ready to go and and he
[1:55:31] comes back there on the back porch and
[1:55:33] he said, "Well, I hear you're going to
[1:55:35] be the preacher." And I said, "Well,
[1:55:37] really, I hope the Lord Jesus is going
[1:55:39] to be the preacher." And he said, "I I
[1:55:42] like that." He said, 'Well, where are
[1:55:44] you taking your subject from? And I
[1:55:46] said, 'Well, Lord willing, I'll start
[1:55:48] out with it. And I told him what
[1:55:51] scripture it was, and he goes, "Oh my."
[1:55:55] He said, "Uh, you could go about three
[1:55:58] or four different ways with that." And I
[1:56:01] thought, "What?" And I said, "Yes, sir,
[1:56:04] you could." And I told him what I was
[1:56:08] planning on titling it that day,
[1:56:11] that evening.
[1:56:13] And he said, "Oh," he said, "if I wasn't
[1:56:16] obligated." He he he said, "I'd like to
[1:56:19] hear that."
[1:56:21] Well, come to find out years ago, he
[1:56:25] started running for his health, but he
[1:56:27] didn't want to just spend his time
[1:56:29] running. So, he started memorizing
[1:56:32] scripture. When I told him what verse I
[1:56:35] was going to take, he rattles off about
[1:56:38] six verses above and below where I told
[1:56:42] him I was at.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Made me ashamed of myself.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; He go he tells him goodbye. He goes
[1:56:56] downstairs, crawls in his truck, and his
[1:56:58] truck won't start.
[1:57:03] told her, said, "Go tell them men to
[1:57:06] come down and pray for my truck
[1:57:10] so I can go home."
[1:57:14] Brother Roberto,
[1:57:16] is he still around?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; I I I guess he had been in the Air Force
[1:57:30] as a mechanic. Yeah.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; And at any rate, he he went down and uh
[1:57:36] I told him I said, "Well, let's pop the
[1:57:38] hood." And and we did and you couldn't
[1:57:41] smell any gas. And I told him I I said,
[1:57:44] "Well, try and turn it over." And he
[1:57:46] did. They just yang yang yang yang yang.
[1:57:50] Brother Roberto said, "Brother Farmer,"
[1:57:53] he's a Air Force mechanic, worked in the
[1:57:55] motor pool, good mechanic. And he says,
[1:57:59] "Brother Pal Farmer," he said, 'What do
[1:58:00] you think it is?' And I said, 'Well,
[1:58:02] brother, I'm not smelling any gas. I
[1:58:04] said, 'Th That's certainly not throwing
[1:58:05] any fire. He said, 'Well, what do you
[1:58:07] think? I said, I thought it's a fuel
[1:58:09] problem. And and he said, well, what are
[1:58:12] we going to do? I said, brother, he
[1:58:14] didn't ask us to fix his truck. He told
[1:58:17] us to come down and pray for it.
[1:58:22] I laid my hand over on the radiator
[1:58:24] support and your husband come up and
[1:58:26] laid a hand on my shoulder and it was
[1:58:29] about like you put a set of jumper
[1:58:31] cables on.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love [cheering and applause]
[1:58:36] it when the believers came together in
[1:58:40] one mind and a [applause and cheering]
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; just prayed a simple little prayer.
[1:58:46] Lord, my brothers need this truck to
[1:58:49] start.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; we backed up.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I said, "Tell him try and start it
[1:59:01] again." It didn't even make a full
[1:59:04] revolution and it kicked right off. He
[1:59:06] jumps out of the truck. He said, "I knew
[1:59:08] if you all would come down and pray for
[1:59:10] it that it would start."
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; You can't with faith like that. HOW
[1:59:16] COULD IT NOT HAPPEN?
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES,
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; CHURCH. Just trusting God.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Just trust a total deliverance. He's an
[1:59:28] everpresent help.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; I went home after that weekend. I was
[1:59:36] down Mississippi uh uh uh down by
[1:59:39] Batesville, Mississippi preaching for a
[1:59:41] little group and I testified about what
[1:59:44] had happened up here. Okay.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Actually, there was something else that
[1:59:49] happened. A a
[1:59:52] there there was a a a brother out in
[1:59:54] Idaho that they had a a singing deal out
[1:59:59] there called Wounded Believers and and
[2:00:02] they asked uh Brother Dutton to get up
[2:00:05] and dismiss. And and that that group I
[2:00:08] I'm not making fun. They're but they're
[2:00:11] just very structured that that when they
[2:00:14] tell you to get up and dismiss, you've
[2:00:16] got 45 seconds to dismiss and start
[2:00:19] singing Take the name of Jesus with you
[2:00:23] just the way they are.
[2:00:25] But brother Frank got up and he said,
[2:00:28] "Y'all before we dismiss, I just feel
[2:00:31] led to tell y'all a little bit about my
[2:00:34] conversion."
[2:00:36] He's older now,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; but he's going to remind some of the
[2:00:40] young people,
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; you rehearse these things to your
[2:00:46] children and your children's children.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; So, he was going to do that and he got
[2:00:54] out of the box that they had for him
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; and about 15 20 minutes later, we had a
[2:01:02] prayer line. Yeah.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Then two weeks later, they had a meeting
[2:01:10] up in another state up in Genanoa,
[2:01:12] Illinois. And I went up there because I
[2:01:15] had a bunch of grandb babies and my my
[2:01:18] girl was up there. And so we go up and
[2:01:23] they've got two men that they get up and
[2:01:26] they've only got about five or seven
[2:01:28] minutes to speak.
[2:01:31] I hate going to some place where you
[2:01:34] have to speak.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with preaching?
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; That's preaching.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; If a bunch of believers are together,
[2:01:45] that ought to be a problem.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; And these two men, they got out of their
[2:01:50] box and it was like what had started out
[2:01:53] in Idaho had carried over into Illinois.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:58] And then I'm down here the next week and
[2:02:02] we prayed for that truck and it started.
[2:02:05] I go down to Mississippi and I gave
[2:02:08] witness of it and about three days,
[2:02:12] three or four days, it was that next
[2:02:14] week, a brother brought a lawnmower over
[2:02:17] to the the minister's house and uh he
[2:02:21] said, "Yeah, I said just get it off
[2:02:23] there and I I I'll clean the carburetor
[2:02:25] on it."
[2:02:27] and he went back in his house and he
[2:02:29] heard a racket about 15 minutes later
[2:02:32] and he looked out and that guy had never
[2:02:34] left
[2:02:36] and he steps out and his hood was up and
[2:02:40] he said, "What's going on?" He said, "I
[2:02:42] don't know." He said, "My truck won't
[2:02:44] start."
[2:02:46] And he walked over there and he he said,
[2:02:48] "Well, have you checked this? Have you
[2:02:50] checked that? Have you checked this
[2:02:51] other? Have you checked that other?" and
[2:02:54] and and the the boy said, "Uh, yes, sir.
[2:02:57] I've done all that." And he said, "Well,
[2:02:58] you've done everything I'd think of to
[2:03:00] check."
[2:03:02] He said, "And something went through my
[2:03:04] mind." Said, "Brother Farmer said he
[2:03:06] laid his hand on the radiator support."
[2:03:09] So, he just stretch over on the
[2:03:11] radiator,
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; and he prayed for it. He said, "Try
[2:03:16] starting it now." And it kicked right
[2:03:19] up. He said, "What'd you do?" said, "I
[2:03:21] prayed for it."
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Michael gets on the phone.
[2:03:28] Yeah. That same Michael, brother.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Gets on the phone and calls me and he
[2:03:35] tells me about it.
[2:03:37] I called up brother Frank.
[2:03:40] And I said, "Brother Frank, it was
[2:03:42] almost like what you started out there
[2:03:44] just carried on over
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; and over and over and over." and and he
[2:03:50] said, "Brother Farmer, have you ever
[2:03:52] heard about what happened on the way
[2:03:54] down to Dale Hollow Lake?" Well, I I
[2:03:56] knew about the fish being resurrected,
[2:03:59] uh uh the brother George Burcham, you
[2:04:02] you remember brother Brandham talking
[2:04:03] about the brother down in Kentucky that
[2:04:05] had the cheese factory? Yeah. And he
[2:04:08] said, "I thought he they made enough
[2:04:10] cheese to feed the world." He said, "I
[2:04:12] thought a cheese plant would be a dirty
[2:04:14] place." He said, "Oh, not that. It was
[2:04:16] just sparkling." Well, brother George
[2:04:19] Burcham had taken my father-in-law and
[2:04:22] me uh out to show us that cove on uh
[2:04:26] Dale Holler Lake where the fish was
[2:04:29] resurrected. Well, I'd known about that.
[2:04:32] And I said, "You're talking about the
[2:04:33] resurrection of He said, "No, I'm
[2:04:35] talking about on the way down."
[2:04:39] And I said, "No, sir. I don't guess I
[2:04:41] have." And he said, uh, some of y'all
[2:04:45] remember Brother Brandham telling the
[2:04:47] story that Brother Banks Woods's brother
[2:04:50] Kyle, uh, that they was going down
[2:04:53] through there and Brother Kyle wasn't a
[2:04:55] believer yet.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If you hadn't went out
[2:05:00] that window when you did, you'd be a
[2:05:03] dead man."
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; And he turned around because he knew
[2:05:08] that nobody knew about that.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:05:13] But God knew about it.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; But as they were going out of
[2:05:19] Campbellville, they went they drove down
[2:05:22] a road and one of them either brother
[2:05:24] Banks or Brother Kyle uh pointed to a
[2:05:28] house and said, "That's where our uh
[2:05:32] Adventist Sunday school teacher
[2:05:35] lived."
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; And and the other one said, "Yeah."
[2:05:38] said, "We need to stop and tell her that
[2:05:41] we give our life to the Lord."
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that what they
[2:05:49] said so pleased God
[2:05:53] that God allowed them
[2:05:56] to see the resurrection of that fish.
[2:05:59] Amen.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Church, I want you to know that I have
[2:06:02] dedicated in my life that I want to be
[2:06:05] found saying something or doing
[2:06:08] something that so pleases the Lord that
[2:06:12] I can see his glory.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; All the time.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Church, I I'm going to close here in
[2:06:21] just a second.
[2:06:24] You know
[2:06:26] the uh
[2:06:30] in Leviticus and Numbers
[2:06:34] we read how that the
[2:06:40] cities of refuge
[2:06:42] that was established.
[2:06:47] And
[2:06:51] there was a condition to that.
[2:06:55] The roads had to be maintained.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; We've read in several places that one of
[2:07:03] the interpretations said that the road
[2:07:06] going to a city of refuge had to be
[2:07:09] almost twice the size of any of the
[2:07:12] other roads. That's right. And the
[2:07:14] community that was nearest uh to that
[2:07:17] road was the ones that was obligated to
[2:07:21] take care of it.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; The community
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; around it. Yeah.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; And then I've also now I don't believe
[2:07:33] it that it's anywhere in the Levitical
[2:07:36] law, but what they actually established
[2:07:41] was that the there had to be signs that
[2:07:45] was clearly pointing to the city of
[2:07:48] refuge.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; And they even made those signs a certain
[2:07:52] size. But then they established it that
[2:07:56] it become a habit that there had to be
[2:07:59] two people that would go with the man
[2:08:03] that was fleeing to a city of refuge
[2:08:07] that knew the way.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help us that know the way THAT
[2:08:15] WHEN SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO GET BACK to
[2:08:18] that city of refuge.
[2:08:21] Amen.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Then remember,
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; they had to stay there in the city of
[2:08:29] refuge until the death of the high
[2:08:32] priest.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; I heard someone say here the other day
[2:08:36] that they had looked it up and there
[2:08:38] were 83 high priests uh uh uh both
[2:08:42] before David and after David uh that had
[2:08:46] went off the scene. So they had 83 of
[2:08:50] those jubilee times that then a
[2:08:53] manslayer was not compelled to stay in
[2:08:56] there. But at the death of the high
[2:08:59] priest, but those high priests was only
[2:09:02] a shadow
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; of the high priest
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; that after the death of the high priest,
[2:09:10] we wasn't compelled to stay in a city of
[2:09:14] refuge. But we had our freedom. We had
[2:09:18] total liberty.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; A total deliverance.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Church,
[2:09:26] our families,
[2:09:28] we have responsibility.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Not just to tell them,
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; but to show
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; to show them
[2:09:45] you daddies.
[2:09:48] I'm gonna get on your case for just a
[2:09:49] minute.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Go right ahead.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; I know the prophet of God said
[2:09:55] that mama was a pastor to her little
[2:09:58] congregation.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; And he said there's not four gospels,
[2:10:02] there's five gospels, Mark, Luke, John,
[2:10:05] and Mama.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he said.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; You sisters, you you've got a great
[2:10:14] commission right there.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:10:16] Amen.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:21] And you know with our children we we
[2:10:24] show them love. We show them support.
[2:10:28] But Ephesians 6 and verse four
[2:10:33] doesn't tell us to raise them with
[2:10:36] wealth
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; and luxury.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; No. And I know a lot of times people
[2:10:42] misstate this verse and they call it in
[2:10:45] the fear and admonition of the Lord,
[2:10:49] but that's not really what it says.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; What it says is the nurture.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; And the admonition of the Lord.
[2:10:59] But yet when I looked up that word
[2:11:01] nurture because the way that we use it
[2:11:04] in the English language, it it's looking
[2:11:08] as unto nourishment.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; But it don't mean that. That's
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:11:14] What it meant
[2:11:21] was chastisement
[2:11:24] instruction
[2:11:26] which aims at increasing value.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; An admonition
[2:11:34] was to teach, to warn, and exhort.
[2:11:40] [crying]
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. our children
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; in the way of the Lord
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; and us daddies.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; We have a name around the house
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; of husband.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; You know where that word comes from?
[2:12:02] We don't have the word agriculture in
[2:12:04] the Bible.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; It's not in here.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; But there's another word for it.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's called husbandry.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; And the man that is engaged in that
[2:12:21] is the husband man.
[2:12:26] He is responsible
[2:12:29] for the growth of the fields that he
[2:12:33] has.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; And our families.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Are our fields.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, we've got pastor mom,
[2:12:45] but we've also got priest daddy.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; That we're responsible.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; It's not my job and brother Juan's job
[2:12:57] and the other ministers job in here to
[2:12:59] get your children through to the Holy
[2:13:02] Ghost.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; That is actually yours.
[2:13:11] We are to have them in the scriptures.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; We are to have them in the instruction
[2:13:23] of the scriptures.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; We are to be teaching them line upon
[2:13:30] line. Let me tell you something.
[2:13:36] The ministry can't make up for 24 hours
[2:13:40] a day with three hours a week if we make
[2:13:44] all the services.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; We can't compete with the time that a
[2:13:50] teacher has when they're spending eight
[2:13:53] hours in front of them just to plant
[2:13:56] things in their mind.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Right. But
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; we're responsible.
[2:14:04] Amen.
[2:14:16] While we were,
[2:14:19] brother Juan, while we were up there in
[2:14:21] Sabino Canyon
[2:14:24] under Eagle Rock, I told you I pro we
[2:14:27] had church up there. Well, I brought up
[2:14:30] something else that the other brothers
[2:14:33] had never heard of.
[2:14:35] It's on return in Jubilee.
[2:14:38] Are y'all familiar with that?
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had preached down at
[2:14:42] brother Jack Moore's church and what
[2:14:45] they uh
[2:14:48] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost fell at
[2:14:51] Isuza Street in ' 06. I'm going to let
[2:14:53] you go in just a few minutes, but bear
[2:14:56] with me here for for
[2:15:01] Six years later in Louisiana,
[2:15:05] they had an outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:08] like what they had at Isuza Street. And
[2:15:12] that's the reason why that not in 56 but
[2:15:16] in 62 that brother Brandham was
[2:15:19] preaching return and jubilee.
[2:15:23] The night before or the morning before
[2:15:27] that brother Brandham preached Returning
[2:15:29] Jubilee, there was an older brother that
[2:15:33] had been at Isuza Street at that
[2:15:36] outpouring and he preached that morning.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; And at the end of the service,
[2:15:44] Brother Brandham turns around,
[2:15:47] don't don't turn the tape off when they
[2:15:50] start singing. go through that worship
[2:15:53] service.
[2:15:56] And brother Brandham turns around to the
[2:15:59] brother. He had sent brother Fred
[2:16:01] Soffman on down to Shreport. They him
[2:16:05] and brother Billy got caught in a storm
[2:16:08] and had to spend the night in Little
[2:16:10] Rock and didn't get down till later in
[2:16:13] the day. But brother Fred recorded it.
[2:16:17] And evidently, Brother Brandham must
[2:16:20] have listened to it or talked to
[2:16:21] somebody that had been there.
[2:16:25] And he turns around, he said, "Let me
[2:16:27] ask this old patriarch."
[2:16:30] He said, "Brother, the things I preached
[2:16:33] about tonight," he said, "Is that the
[2:16:36] things that you all fought for back
[2:16:39] then?"
[2:16:41] And you hear this old man
[2:16:45] He says absolutely
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; he said in the beginning it was
[2:16:53] wonderful.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; It was wonderful. He said but step by
[2:17:00] step we fell into the clutches of the
[2:17:04] machinery of human genius making.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "In order to save the
[2:17:11] movement, we've got to go back."
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; We've got to go back.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; And he's crying. And brother Brandham
[2:17:20] takes the mic back and he said, "Hear
[2:17:22] the cry of that old patriarch."
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; We've got to go back.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; My mama and daddy
[2:17:36] was first generation.
[2:17:43] I'm second.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; My baby that y'all may have met up at
[2:17:49] brothers
[2:17:52] brother Wart's funeral
[2:17:55] Anna and Daniel Miller.
[2:17:58] That's that's my kids. I I don't have a
[2:18:00] son-in-law. I got eight kids now. Still
[2:18:04] four.
[2:18:08] Anna
[2:18:10] and my three boys
[2:18:13] are third generation.
[2:18:17] My grandbabies
[2:18:20] are fourth generation.
[2:18:24] They've been exposed to the message all
[2:18:27] of their lives.
[2:18:30] In the Ephesian church age on page 88,
[2:18:35] brother Brandham says, "Revelation 2
[2:18:38] and4,
[2:18:40] nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[2:18:43] thee because thou hast left thy first
[2:18:47] love."
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; To understand this, you must realize
[2:18:52] that the spirit is not speaking to the
[2:18:55] original saints of Ephesus alone.
[2:19:00] The message is to the entire age
[2:19:05] which lasted about 120 years. Its
[2:19:10] message then is to all the generations
[2:19:14] in that span.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Now history keeps repeating itself
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; in the generations of Israel. We see
[2:19:27] revival in one generation only to see
[2:19:31] the fires fading in the next.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; If you've ever read all the way through
[2:19:37] the book of Judges,
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; they get down here again and the Lord
[2:19:46] brings them another judge and he
[2:19:49] delivers them. One time it was even a
[2:19:53] woman judged Deborah. Then they're back
[2:19:56] down here. Then they're back up. Then
[2:19:58] they're back down.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Now history keeps repeating itself in
[2:20:12] the generations of Israel. We see
[2:20:15] revival in one generation
[2:20:18] only to see the fires fading in the
[2:20:21] next. In the third generation,
[2:20:25] embers may be glowing slightly.
[2:20:33] But in the fourth generation,
[2:20:53] There may be no vestage whatsoever
[2:20:58] of that original flame.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Church, that's why I'm crying out.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to get these young ones
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; to the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; It'll be worth every minute that we
[2:21:18] spend. It'll be worth every every night
[2:21:23] that instead of us being engaged in
[2:21:26] something else, but we've got our
[2:21:28] children or our grandchildren sitting
[2:21:31] down in the living room and go back
[2:21:34] through these things
[2:21:38] that they can experience and then try to
[2:21:42] get them in an atmosphere of worship
[2:21:46] where they can feel the power of God the
[2:21:50] way that it got a hold of you and I.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Without that there will be no
[2:21:58] resemblance.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; And remember
[2:22:03] the original is not only a name and a
[2:22:07] resemblance.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; But it's that same.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:12] If that same spirit
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; dwells in you
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; that raised Christ from the dead,
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; it'll quicken your mortal body. It'll
[2:22:24] quicken my children's mortal body. I've
[2:22:28] got a grandbaby right now that by the
[2:22:31] grace of God, I've got three of them
[2:22:34] that by the grace of God, they're on
[2:22:37] fire for God. Hallelujah.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; One of them is leading some children in
[2:22:43] their church that they want to see the
[2:22:45] rest of the children have a revival in
[2:22:48] that church.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; What does that see a mama and a daddy or
[2:22:56] a grandma and a grandpa that's crying
[2:22:59] out for more of God
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; and it inspires
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; it encourages.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Church, don't give up.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Don't give up. This is no time for us to
[2:23:13] slow down.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; You notice a runner,
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; I don't care if he's trained to run a
[2:23:20] marathon.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; And I know the scripture tells us to run
[2:23:24] with patience, the race that's set
[2:23:27] before us. But there is something that
[2:23:30] happens in a runner's body when he sees
[2:23:34] the finish line
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; just ahead of him that he's been pacing
[2:23:39] himself down.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; But right there at the very last he is
[2:23:44] not only running but he is sprinting
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; across that finish line. When they get
[2:23:53] done,
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; they may just fall on the ground.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; They may be on all fours
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; panting,
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; but I think of this song.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it after a while, child.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it after a while.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know all the words to
[2:24:20] it.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. They let me play music at home
[2:24:23] just so I
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; I won't sing.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; God's gifted some of us to sing,
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; some of us.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; But church, I want you to know I'm not
[2:24:39] content to sat down.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; I had a friend that
[2:24:45] he got a a bad medical diagnosis
[2:24:49] and
[2:24:56] I wrote a song said Kadesh uh uh Barnea
[2:25:01] at the gateway to the kingdom. The spies
[2:25:03] were sent ahead uh to look and see. 10
[2:25:07] said we can't do it. But two said we're
[2:25:10] more than able. Don't say down here.
[2:25:13] Come run with me. Don't sit down here.
[2:25:16] Come run with me. There's so much more
[2:25:19] of God's word for us to see.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; You can sit in doubt or you can fly and
[2:25:26] be free. Don't sit down here. Come run
[2:25:30] with me.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Too high. The doctor said he's dying. He
[2:25:36] said, "Oh, doc, you're lying. You're
[2:25:39] looking at a chart, but I see a plan. I
[2:25:43] know that life is fleeting and someday
[2:25:46] I'll be leaving. But don't sit down
[2:25:49] here. Come run with me.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Don't sit down here. Come run with me.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; There's so much more of God's word for
[2:25:59] us to see.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; You can sit and doubt or you can fly and
[2:26:05] be free. Don't sit down here. Come run
[2:26:09] with me. Y'all don't know that one. I
[2:26:12] know,
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; but I think you might know this one.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; My heavenly home is bright and fair. Let
[2:26:21] them come to the music. I feel like
[2:26:24] traveling on.
[2:26:26] No pain nor death can enter [singing]
[2:26:31] there. I feel like traveling on.
[2:26:37] Oh yes, I feel like [singing] traveling.
[2:26:41] Oh,
[2:26:42] brother. I'm gifted for getting
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; my heavenly [singing]
[2:26:50] home is bright and fair. I feel like
[2:26:56] traveling.
[2:26:59] Oh, with glittering towers, the sun out
[2:27:04] shine. I [singing] feel like traveling
[2:27:08] all
[2:27:10] and the heavenly [singing] nine. [music]

[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I [singing and music] feel like
[2:27:23] traveling home.

[2:27:32] my heavenly [music and singing]
[2:27:34] home

[2:27:38] I feel like traveling along.
[2:27:43] [music]
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Let's listen to this one now. The Lord
[2:27:47] has been [music] so good to me. I feel
[2:27:53] like traveling on
[2:27:57] until that place.
[2:28:00] Oh [singing and music] my
[2:28:03] feeling.

[2:28:21] so bright and [music] fair.
[2:28:28] Amen.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; I wonder anybody in here tonight
[2:28:35] that feels like you've been lagging
[2:28:36] behind a little bit in the race
[2:28:40] and you just want to pick up a little
[2:28:42] bit more [music] and you want to ask the
[2:28:45] Lord to strengthen us.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. the this this final burst of
[2:28:50] energy [music] that we need between here
[2:28:53] and a rapture
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; that he just give us that strength.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me.
[2:29:02] We've held back on things for way too
[2:29:05] long when it ought to just be pressing
[2:29:09] that much closer to the mark.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; Let's all just pray together as they
[2:29:15] play this.
[2:29:17] Father, you see our hands raised up to
[2:29:20] you, Lord. Mine here also, Lord, but
[2:29:24] what I've seen and just looking up these
[2:29:28] things, Lord, [music]
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; how it's quickened my heart to do more,
[2:29:33] Lord, to push harder, to encourage more.
[2:29:38] Lord,
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; help me to clear the road on the way to
[2:29:43] a city of refuge for somebody that's
[2:29:46] seeking their way to get back here.
[2:29:48] [music]
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Help us, oh God. Lord, you see their
[2:29:52] hands raised up all over the [singing]
[2:29:54] building. [music]
[2:29:55] We've got families to start with. We've
[2:29:59] got neighborhoods to start with. Lord,
[2:30:01] [music]
[2:30:02] [singing]
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; help us, Father.
[2:30:06] Let us have that same spirit Lord and
[2:30:11] then not to bind it down, not to choke
[2:30:14] it down, Lord, but deliver us from our
[2:30:18] tomb of selfwill that we could fulfill
[2:30:22] your [singing] will [music]
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you [music] Jesus. Thank you,
[2:30:32] Lord.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. [music] I [singing] feel like
[2:30:39] traveling on.
[2:30:42] Oh, I feel like traveling on
[2:30:45] [singing and music]
[2:30:47] my heavenly home, so bright and fair, I
[2:30:53] feel like traveling. Oh,
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Amen. [music]
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; I just I just want to read that quote
[2:31:07] there, [music] brother. But fam, started
[2:31:09] with tonight. Uh Emanuel, I sent it over
[2:31:11] there to the to the to your to your
[2:31:15] mail. Can you just put it up for us
[2:31:17] tonight? We want to just read that and
[2:31:19] close the service tonight. [music] But
[2:31:22] I'm telling you, uh I mean, we we
[2:31:25] becoming so slack and so lazy right now.
[2:31:29] I mean, we we becoming conscious of our
[2:31:31] time. We want to run and grab our bed.
[2:31:34] But I'm telling you that something
[2:31:35] serious [music] is happening tonight.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Very serious.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; I was on my way to church tonight and I
[2:31:42] was just talking to a young person and
[2:31:44] just uh uh [music] speaking some things
[2:31:46] to them and you know counseling them and
[2:31:50] I just told them the very same thing.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; I says uh uh we we we we have a crisis.
[2:31:58] That's right.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; We have a we have an epidemic. [music]
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; That we don't want to admit.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; we have an epidemic. We have a problem
[2:32:07] on our hands.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Lot of our young people [music] have
[2:32:11] already been defied in their mind
[2:32:14] by the things that they are exposed to.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; We have a problem on our hands. And
[2:32:20] until we begin to see that it concern
[2:32:23] us,
[2:32:26] we have a problem on our hands.
[2:32:29] And I was just [music] telling that
[2:32:31] young person on the phone, I say sir, I
[2:32:34] mean uh we we we we just think that uh
[2:32:37] uh uh is is going to be okay when we get
[2:32:39] married or we just think that and and
[2:32:42] that is the reason why we can't even
[2:32:43] keep a home. We can't keep a family.
[2:32:51] It's true.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; We have a problem on our head. It's a
[2:32:55] serious problem.
[2:33:08] Doctors will tell us that uh this is the
[2:33:11] worst thing that you can put in the
[2:33:13] hands of your child.
[2:33:17] truth.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; But that's the age that we in. That's
[2:33:23] the place where we find ourself.
[2:33:26] And then we just we just sit back. We
[2:33:28] give it to them for entertainment
[2:33:29] because we don't want them to bother us.
[2:33:43] Let's read that quote together
[2:33:51] and then we go to the Lord in prayer.
[2:33:56] Oh, you listen to me as I try to read
[2:33:58] it. If our heart condemn us now after we
[2:34:03] being preached to tonight the way we
[2:34:06] being preached to tonight,
[2:34:08] church, if we would just don't take this
[2:34:11] service
[2:34:13] like
[2:34:15] just an ordinary service.
[2:34:19] I don't care even if we don't have
[2:34:20] service [music] tonight. If we stay late
[2:34:23] and you don't want to come to church
[2:34:24] tomorrow, that's up to you. You can stay
[2:34:27] home and enjoy your sleep.
[2:34:29] But what is the need of coming here and
[2:34:32] being exposed to the word of God and the
[2:34:34] Holy Spirit will speak to us like this
[2:34:37] and we just say that quick prayer jump
[2:34:39] in our car and go right back into the
[2:34:41] same thing. What is the reason? What is
[2:34:43] THE REASON? WHAT WHAT IS the need of
[2:34:45] having service?
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; If we are NOT READY TO GET IF WE ARE NOT
[2:34:49] READY TO get serious with God.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:02] If how if our hearts will condemn us
[2:35:05] now, I don't believe the preacher
[2:35:07] preached to condemn us tonight. He
[2:35:09] preached to convict us.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; We need to come to some sense of
[2:35:13] conviction.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; We always looking for who to blame.
[2:35:17] We're always looking for who to look
[2:35:19] around. That is the cause of our
[2:35:21] problem.
[2:35:31] If our hearts will condemn us now,
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; we want complete deliverance.
[2:35:39] I don't know about you, but I want
[2:35:40] complete deliverance.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; I want complete deliverance.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes. Yes.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; I I mean it's just not a time to just uh
[2:35:53] preach and just you just want to keep
[2:35:55] people in church. If I can't help you,
[2:35:58] what is the need of just keeping people
[2:36:00] around
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; or trying to make a name for ourself?
[2:36:12] We hear these things that [music] they
[2:36:13] just they just uh I mean uh uh we we get
[2:36:16] so used to them we can quote them before
[2:36:18] the preacher. We can we have another
[2:36:20] quote to counter out what the preacher
[2:36:22] is saying.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; We want complete deliverance. We don't
[2:36:30] want to be a halfway church.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be a halfway church. We
[2:36:39] get scared before people stop coming to
[2:36:41] church
[2:36:43] because we think we uh when we get so
[2:36:45] high on the word we are discouraging
[2:36:47] them.
[2:36:49] That person need a birth.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; They need to be born again. The Bible
[2:36:53] says that no man join himself to the
[2:36:55] apostles.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; The apostles were not seeking for
[2:36:58] members.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; They were seeking for people to be born
[2:37:01] again.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; They wanted people to have an EXPERIENCE
[2:37:04] WITH GOD,
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST TO FILL the church.
[2:37:14] Let me tell you something that you don't
[2:37:16] know or maybe you don't know about me.
[2:37:20] But sometimes when we bring these
[2:37:22] brothers,
[2:37:25] it is not just because one other church
[2:37:27] is having special meetings. We want to
[2:37:29] have special meetings.
[2:37:32] We prayed about these things and
[2:37:34] sometimes [music]
[2:37:36] not not just to bring a man in the
[2:37:37] pullpit that would get us excited and
[2:37:39] and you know make us laugh and and
[2:37:42] [music] just enjoy the word. I believe
[2:37:45] if there is ever the time we need godly
[2:37:47] men in the pull pit,
[2:37:49] man that has godly life.
[2:37:56] If if if there is nothing brother Farmer
[2:37:58] said tonight that you are connected with
[2:38:03] there is one thing that I know that is
[2:38:05] that is that [music] is present in this
[2:38:06] building
[2:38:11] that he's a man that has a life that
[2:38:13] witness to everything he preach.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; It's not how it's not how loud the
[2:38:20] person preach is the life that is behind
[2:38:22] the word.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. It has to be a life of
[2:38:26] concentration, a life of prayer, a life
[2:38:29] of godliness.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's someone [music] that is
[2:38:33] struggling with some kind of a habit or
[2:38:35] you always in some kind of a gossip or
[2:38:38] always in some kind of a church
[2:38:40] conflict.
[2:38:54] If our heart condemn us,
[2:39:00] we want a complete deliverance.
[2:39:03] I don't know if that's how you feel in
[2:39:05] your heart tonight. If your heart is not
[2:39:07] condemning you,
[2:39:10] but if there is something speaking in
[2:39:11] your heart tonight, saying, "God, I
[2:39:13] [music] need a complete deliverance.
[2:39:18] I need to get to [music] the place of a
[2:39:20] clean Christian life.
[2:39:23] I need to stop all my nonsense and get
[2:39:26] to a place of a clean Christian life.
[2:39:28] THERE IS NO WAY YOU can make the Holy
[2:39:31] Ghost to tolerate sin in your life. It's
[2:39:34] not the Holy Ghost.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the strength of God.
[2:39:39] So you cannot make something your
[2:39:41] weakness. You say that's my weakness.
[2:39:43] The Holy GHOST HAVE COME TO EMPOWER YOU
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; TO RISE YOU ABOVE THAT. And if the HOLY
[2:39:49] GHOST IS IN YOUR LIFE, IT WILL LIFT YOU
[2:39:51] ABOVE THAT. THE HOLY GHOST WILL NOT BE
[2:39:53] comfortable with your weakness.
[2:40:18] Let's read there so we can pray tonight.
[2:40:28] If our heart condemn us there,
[2:40:31] we want a complete deliverance.
[2:40:34] We don't want to be a halfway church.
[2:40:37] We want to be a real church or no church
[2:40:40] at all.
[2:40:42] It's either a real church or no church
[2:40:45] at all. We cannot be in the middle. We
[2:40:48] cannot be [music] halfway.
[2:40:53] We want to be real Christians or no
[2:40:54] Christians at all.
[2:40:57] We want total deliverance
[2:40:59] from our habits. [snorts]
[2:41:02] We want total deliverance from our
[2:41:05] habits. I lift my hands up.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but [music] I
[2:41:08] lift my hands up.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; This thing what the church gets so
[2:41:20] comfortable with. We wait for preachers
[2:41:22] to beg people to come to the altar.
[2:41:25] You must feel God dealing with you and
[2:41:27] step out of your seat and come to the
[2:41:29] altar. Don't wait for the preacher who
[2:41:31] who need prayer tonight. Who is there
[2:41:33] anybody? And the preacher would beg and
[2:41:35] he would beg and he would beg.
[2:41:47] [music] We want total deliverance from
[2:41:49] our habit, from our sins, from our evil
[2:41:52] thinking, from our evil doing, from our
[2:41:56] negligence,
[2:41:58] whatever we have done.
[2:42:02] Let's continue. We want total
[2:42:05] deliverance [music]
[2:42:06] so that when people come to this church
[2:42:10] to be prayed for,
[2:42:13] there will be just this little group.
[2:42:18] Just this little group.
[2:42:21] Just this little group tonight.
[2:42:26] All those that are in service with us
[2:42:28] tonight.
[2:42:31] that are on their knees or having their
[2:42:33] hands up. Just this little group
[2:42:40] sitting here, but they will be
[2:42:42] completely in the hands of God.
[2:42:46] And when we pray, [music]
[2:42:48] then God will hear from heaven.
[2:42:52] If the people that are called by my name
[2:42:59] will humble themselves.
[2:43:05] [music]
[2:43:05] Let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight.
[2:43:10] I don't know about you,
[2:43:15] but I don't believe that we just come to
[2:43:17] a lecture. The preacher preach [music]
[2:43:19] it was a good sermon. We pray then we
[2:43:21] just go home. Sometime we have to we
[2:43:24] have to we have to think about what
[2:43:25] being preached.
[2:43:27] We have to digest it. We have to sit
[2:43:29] there and meditate on it. Let something
[2:43:32] from the WORD GRAB YOUR HEART and say
[2:43:35] Lord you were talking to me. I was not
[2:43:37] paying attention.
