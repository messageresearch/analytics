[0:36] and uh we're the tapes goal and that's
[0:39] world
[0:40] around uh this message is are not
[0:44] directed to any certain individual and
[0:47] we wouldn't want people to think that we
[0:49] are some sort of a clan or a bunch of
[0:52] Fanatics that's been uh gathered
[0:54] ourselves together to separate ourselves
[0:57] seemingly not having the faith a SE op
[1:00] at our against anybody or or against God
[1:04] or against the church we are far the
[1:08] church but we're only trying to pourn
[1:11] out by the Holy Spirit and his help the
[1:15] reason for this segregation that we have
[1:18] today we we do not believe in it we
[1:21] believe that all churches ought to be
[1:24] fellowshipping together not uh
[1:26] segregated away the Methodist to their
[1:29] group and the Baptist of theirs and the
[1:32] Oneness and the trinitarians and what we
[1:34] have all separated out we believe that
[1:37] it should be together as one great
[1:40] United group of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:44] waiting for that glorious
[1:46] coming they should not be separated all
[1:49] and what separates it there's bound to
[1:50] be some basic reason that we're not
[1:54] together in studying it I realize in
[1:58] studying it it's not the colors of our
[2:00] skin because yellow black brown and
[2:02] white all separate in different
[2:04] organizations it's not the kind of food
[2:07] we eat we all eat the same food we wear
[2:09] the same kind of clothes and so forth
[2:11] but I see where basically it's at is man
[2:14] who's got off the beaten path of the
[2:17] teaching of the Gospel each man and
[2:19] there ought to be some way to definitely
[2:22] show which is right and wrong and the
[2:24] only way you'll ever do it is not put
[2:26] any interpretation to the word just read
[2:28] it the way it is and believe it that way
[2:30] each man putting his only own
[2:32] interpretation makes it say something
[2:34] different brings it back to the original
[2:36] organization of the Catholic Church
[2:38] which the Catholic Church believes that
[2:40] God is in his church and the word has
[2:43] nothing to do with it and God is in his
[2:45] church and we Protestants as we find in
[2:48] Revelation 17 that all of them heaped up
[2:52] together and that the Catholic church
[2:54] was a mother of all
[2:57] organizations and we see that the pro
[2:59] Protestant organization yet
[3:02] blindly
[3:04] blindly has the same nature of the
[3:07] Catholic Church the Bible calls the
[3:09] Catholic Church a and calls the
[3:12] Protestant Church harlots said that the
[3:15] was a mother of harlots and that
[3:18] is people it's a ill famed woman who
[3:22] doesn't live true to her marriage vows
[3:24] and we all claim to be the bride of
[3:26] Christ and yet so untrue what would make
[3:29] the untr by living contrary to the the
[3:34] discipline that God has laid out for his
[3:37] bride to live by that's my own opinion
[3:40] uh the Bible and it is the infallible
[3:44] word of God I believe and uh therefore
[3:47] we find out that the Protestant Church
[3:49] in order to have an organization
[3:51] separates itself even from the
[3:54] scriptures to make its organization
[3:56] ministers ordained will hold the things
[3:58] that they now they come to my studying
[4:01] in the rooms by the hundreds and tell me
[4:03] brother brandom you make those
[4:05] challenges to people nobody's going to
[4:06] stand out there against that they know
[4:08] it's a truth well I said what why don't
[4:09] you do it well you see if I do I'll be
[4:12] begging my bread not nobody I got a
[4:14] Ministry I've got to get to the Lord and
[4:16] uh I got to get to the people and I'll
[4:19] have no backing up do you only realize
[4:21] that Christ is our backing up the Bible
[4:24] is our backing see but it's see then
[4:28] that throws the the Protestant church
[4:29] Church exactly the very same thing the
[4:32] Catholic church is the Catholic Church
[4:34] doesn't care well I don't say I don't
[4:36] make it that rude to say they don't care
[4:37] what the Bible says they they believe
[4:39] the Bible but see they got a Apostolic
[4:43] succession is what the Catholic church
[4:44] is based upon that's the succession of
[4:47] popes and called Peter the first pope
[4:49] and on down now they they believe that
[4:53] they they emphatically believe that and
[4:55] the Protestant see they they gather
[4:58] together and have an organization just
[5:00] exactly like they did at NAA Rome where
[5:02] they organize the the Catholic Church by
[5:05] at the NAA Council and we find that
[5:08] they're both the
[5:10] same they're both the same they leave
[5:12] the word of God to make an
[5:15] organization and then when it comes to
[5:17] many great truths that seem strange
[5:20] today it's foreign to them because
[5:22] they've only been taught by a ritual we
[5:25] have no ritual but the Bible we have
[5:29] nothing but God's holy word and that's
[5:31] where we stand and now today I want to
[5:35] read some
[5:36] scripture just a minute from the holy
[5:40] sacred word of God found in the book of
[5:44] St Luke the
[5:46] 23rd chapter of St Luke the base did a a
[5:52] platform of what I I want to say a basic
[5:57] thought on the things that I want to
[6:00] speak
[6:01] on and you're turning now to St Luke the
[6:05] 23rd uh chapter and I want to read one
[6:08] verse that's all I need for this basis
[6:11] this morning to place it up
[6:13] on now we read the 20 uh 23rd chapter
[6:18] the 33rd verse of the 23rd
[6:23] chapter and when they came to the place
[6:26] which is called Calvary there crucified
[6:31] him and the malactor one on the right
[6:35] hand and the other on the left now I
[6:39] want to take four words out of there out
[6:44] of that reading to base what I want to
[6:46] say there they crucified him four words
[6:53] and um my subject is
[6:56] called I I'm bringing an
[7:01] indictment uh to the denominational
[7:04] churches of this day and all so many of
[7:08] The
[7:09] Independents for crucifying Jesus Christ
[7:13] aresh in this day indicting them this
[7:18] morning it's called the
[7:20] indictment and I want to kind of use it
[7:23] more like it it was like a room of of a
[7:26] courtroom where there was and after all
[7:29] the pulpit and the church is a
[7:33] courtroom the Bible said it's a judgment
[7:36] seat at must begin at the house of the
[7:41] Lord and this is like the the throne in
[7:45] the and the jury and the witnesses and
[7:48] so forth and I have today for my witness
[7:55] is God's
[7:57] word and my indict is against the
[8:00] churches of today now I I'm not bringing
[8:04] the sinner into this I'm just speaking
[8:06] this to the church and it's it's to be
[8:09] in the the tapes now and uh I'll try to
[8:13] get through as quick as I can I indict
[8:16] this generation for the second
[8:18] crucifixion of Jesus
[8:20] Christ and now to do this in this age
[8:24] that we live in I I do this I'm a show
[8:28] on every evidence if I have to bring an
[8:31] indictment you have to show an Evidence
[8:33] of the criminal offense that has been
[8:36] done I I have to indict them I I have to
[8:40] bring the the evidence to prove it that
[8:43] it is that what I'm seeing will stand up
[8:46] before the main judge which is I take
[8:50] myself as an attorney uh uh on this
[8:53] indictment that the word of God being my
[8:55] witness I indict this generation for the
[8:58] crucifixion
[9:01] I'm must show and will
[9:03] show uh that the same spirit is on the
[9:07] people today that brought the first
[9:09] crucifixion and doing the same
[9:11] thing I I must do that if it's going to
[9:14] be a crucifixion that they've crucified
[9:17] I'm must show to the the people that the
[9:20] same attitude in the people today is
[9:23] doing the same thing spiritually that
[9:26] they did physically then they Cru CR
[9:29] ified physically Jesus Christ the son of
[9:32] God and now today by the same word and
[9:37] by the the same Holy Spirit and the same
[9:40] word I I wish to show the churches that
[9:44] there where they
[9:45] stand uh that they are doing the same
[9:48] thing today and the Bible said they
[9:50] would do it and prove that this is the
[9:53] day that we're living in it could not
[9:56] been done a few years ago I say 50 years
[9:59] ago it could not been done but today
[10:02] this is very
[10:04] timely and it could not have been done
[10:06] maybe 10 years ago but it can be done
[10:10] today
[10:12] because the the time is run
[10:15] out we are we are at the end time and I
[10:20] believe as a servant that we are we're
[10:23] just about to cross from this land to
[10:27] another therefore the time for
[10:30] repentance for a nation is gone I
[10:35] believe that this nation cannot
[10:39] repent I believe that it's crossed the
[10:42] line between mercy and judgment I
[10:46] believe she's toddling in the
[10:49] bounds brother brandham before you start
[10:52] your case how you going to prove that
[10:53] just this that we're guilty of the same
[10:57] sins that God destroyed the World by in
[11:01] the andian world we're guilty of the
[11:04] same sins that he destroyed the world in
[11:07] Sodom and
[11:08] gomorra and now and we got all the same
[11:12] spiritual evidence laying here before us
[11:16] all the same spiritual evidence
[11:18] worldwide
[11:19] known that brought down the mercies of
[11:23] God upon those Generations that also to
[11:27] reject brought judgment so if this
[11:30] generation has rejected the same Mercy
[11:33] that was spurned in them days God would
[11:35] be unjust to let them get by without
[11:40] judgment Jack Moore a friend of mine
[11:42] once said if this nation gets by without
[11:45] a punishment from God then God will be
[11:48] obligated to raise up solom Gore and
[11:52] apologize for burning them up now we
[11:56] know that spiritually they're doing the
[11:57] same thing today for they are doing it
[12:01] to for the same purpose and in the same
[12:05] way that they did in the crucifixion of
[12:07] the Lord physically they're doing it
[12:11] because of
[12:14] jealousy because of spiritual
[12:17] blindness that they don't want to see
[12:20] they won't listen to it Jesus in his
[12:24] journey here on Earth he said well did
[12:27] Isaiah speak of you you got eyes and
[12:29] can't see in ears and can't
[12:31] hear the same reason the same um the
[12:35] same purpose and the same reasonings
[12:38] they're bringing the crucifixion of
[12:41] Christ a new aresh as we'll get to it
[12:43] after a while for the same reasons that
[12:45] they did that they cannot find nothing
[12:48] against it they're Daron to try to
[12:51] challenge
[12:54] it and they know the evidence is
[12:57] there and they know the Bible says so
[13:01] and the only thing they can do is
[13:02] blaspheme
[13:03] it
[13:05] exactly so and all this the same reasons
[13:09] now upon this basis I challenge this
[13:14] generation of the crucifixion of Jesus
[13:17] Christ for a crucifying and guilty with
[13:21] dirty Wicked selfish denominational
[13:24] hands as crucifying the Prince of Life
[13:27] that wanted to present itself to the
[13:28] people
[13:30] people you say the same
[13:32] person in the beginning was the
[13:36] word and the Word was God and the Word
[13:41] was made
[13:42] flesh and manifested itself the word was
[13:45] manifested in flesh and they condemned
[13:48] the Flesh and put it to death because
[13:51] the word was manifested Hebrews 138 said
[13:54] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[13:56] and forever it's the same word amen and
[14:00] for the same reason they are trying to
[14:02] crucify the word now to my text to break
[14:06] back upon the subject that I want to
[14:08] take there the four words let's explain
[14:11] there there the most holy city in the
[14:16] world
[14:19] Jerusalem there the most religious city
[14:23] in the
[14:24] world there they the most religious
[14:28] people people in the
[14:30] world at a religious feast the Feast of
[14:34] the
[14:36] Passover there the most religious spot
[14:39] the most religious City the the greatest
[14:41] of all the organizations the head of all
[14:43] of it there they the most religious
[14:47] people in all the world had gathered
[14:49] from all over the world They Crucified
[14:52] the most shameful death that could be
[14:55] kill person could be killed naked
[14:57] stripped the clothes from him he he
[14:59] despised the reproach they the crucifix
[15:03] has a a rag wrapped around him but they
[15:06] stripped his clothes from him the most
[15:09] shameful
[15:10] there the greatest religious City they
[15:14] the most religious people crucified the
[15:17] most shameful death him the most
[15:20] precious
[15:22] person that ain't enough to condemn this
[15:27] generation there
[15:29] the most religious organization the
[15:32] biggest of all the churches gathered
[15:34] together in one
[15:36] place they the most religious people of
[15:38] all the
[15:40] races the people who are supposed to be
[15:43] the very worshippers of God they
[15:46] gathered at the greatest holy Feast they
[15:49] got the cleansing of the the Passover
[15:52] when they was brought from bondage into
[15:54] Liberty and there in that time they at
[15:58] that time
[16:00] the most religious people in their most
[16:01] religious feast at the most religious
[16:03] Place brought upon the Prince of
[16:08] Life the most shameful thing that could
[16:12] be done to strip a man and to hang him
[16:14] on a tree because cursed is he said the
[16:17] law that they worship by cursed is he
[16:21] that hangs upon a tree and he was made a
[16:24] curse for us stripping his clothes
[16:27] beating him in walking him the very God
[16:30] Of Heaven taking his clothes from him
[16:33] and nailing him to a cross him there
[16:36] they crucified him under
[16:39] Roman capital
[16:41] punishment the most shameful death today
[16:44] would not be shot the most shameful
[16:47] death today would not be to be uh uh run
[16:51] over by a car and killed drowned by
[16:54] water burned by fire but the most
[16:56] shameful death today is
[16:59] public capital punishment where that the
[17:03] whole world condemns you and calls you
[17:06] guilty and the whole world put their
[17:09] hands upon this man and called him
[17:11] guilty when he was
[17:12] innocent and he died under the enemies
[17:17] not his friends not his LW but under the
[17:20] enemy's crucifixion the Prince of Life
[17:24] the most precious person that there ever
[17:26] lived or ever will live amen Jesus
[17:29] Christ him the most precious person keep
[17:32] that in mind now as we build that
[17:34] platform around today could you
[17:38] imagine at a place like Jerusalem where
[17:42] for 2500 years or more that the people
[17:45] or hundreds of years I may be a little
[17:47] long than that might have been about 8
[17:49] or 900 years or something I don't know
[17:51] it's how what the distance in time
[17:52] Solomon built the temple I imagine about
[17:54] 800 years something like that and they'd
[17:57] look for a coming Messiah
[17:59] they had gathered there for the worship
[18:01] of the Passover just think of it now the
[18:05] head of all of the Pharisees Sadducees
[18:08] and what have you one great
[18:12] Gathering to worship God Most Holy Place
[18:16] Jerusalem the Temple of the Lord and the
[18:20] people of the Lord took the Lord himself
[18:24] and crucified
[18:27] him with capital
[18:29] punishment such a thing now them four
[18:33] words they there they crucified him now
[18:37] you so the Bible you see it's just four
[18:39] words but the Bible condenses its truths
[18:44] now me I have to go way around and
[18:46] explain what I'm talking about but the
[18:48] Bible don't have to explain
[18:50] nothing it just is all truth so the the
[18:54] the the Bible don't have to explain
[18:56] anything it it it doesn't have to
[18:59] explain it because it is all the truth
[19:01] here is four words of its great chain of
[19:05] Truth I'll try to explain it and to try
[19:10] to explain it clearly would make a
[19:12] library there's no way for me to explain
[19:15] those four
[19:16] words but now let us by the help of him
[19:20] who caused it to be written try to
[19:23] explain these four words to bring it in
[19:25] such a way that people would understand
[19:28] it
[19:30] what we got before us now we got the
[19:32] first
[19:33] crucifixion laying before us at the most
[19:37] holy place the most religious people the
[19:41] most shameful death to the most precious
[19:45] person oh it's such a
[19:47] contradictory my my it's
[19:51] disgraceful now let's take first the
[19:54] first word there let's talk on it a few
[19:56] minutes before we bring the indictment
[19:58] we'll break this down and show you what
[19:59] they was doing then we'll find out if my
[20:02] indictment is correct or not there
[20:05] Jerusalem Most Holy simple place because
[20:08] the temple was there the most holy place
[20:10] because it the temple was there and Jews
[20:13] from all over the world gathered to this
[20:16] one place of meeting grounds uh for
[20:20] worship the
[20:22] most greatest place for worship that
[20:24] there was was at Jerusalem the temple
[20:27] was there that's it's written all men
[20:30] ought to worship at
[20:33] Jerusalem all right because it's a
[20:35] center of
[20:37] worship and today you hear them one of
[20:40] them wants to say they oh we come to
[20:42] these great conventions where these uh
[20:44] denominations have it and and then we
[20:47] have the the opening of the the Vatican
[20:50] City and and these ordinations of popes
[20:53] and so forth everybody says we all are
[20:56] to go to the campgrounds of the
[20:58] methodists or the the Bible Baptist
[21:01] convention or or we all are to go to to
[21:05] Rome and there were the Great Center
[21:08] they call of
[21:10] Christianity during the time of the last
[21:12] war when Rome fell these German soldiers
[21:16] many of you boys know about this them
[21:18] German soldiers got back up into the
[21:21] Vatican City there and firing out at the
[21:24] Americans as they were advancing brother
[21:27] Funk and brother Roberson and many of
[21:29] brother beer and many of those Brethren
[21:31] who was in that war knows and you know
[21:34] what we issued orders that they could
[21:37] not fire on that
[21:40] City Americans you stood there and you
[21:43] was a Target to them but at the West uh
[21:48] the Westminister uh Abbey at the in
[21:52] England you could fire on that all right
[21:54] that's where the Protestants gathered so
[21:56] it was all right to fire on that but not
[21:58] the fire on the Vatican because as
[22:02] president uh Roosevelt I heard his
[22:04] speech when he when he broadcast it that
[22:07] night called the Fireside talk he said
[22:10] when Rome fell he said it's such a shame
[22:12] because Rome is the head of all
[22:16] Christianity could you imagine a
[22:18] Protestant saying that so the great
[22:22] Center of Christian religion well we're
[22:26] going to we're going to place that like
[22:28] Jerusalem if you wish to if you'd like
[22:30] to do that let's put that at Jerusalem
[22:33] the head of all these other the the the
[22:36] Sanhedrin and and of the Pharisees and
[22:39] of the the Sadducees all of them went up
[22:41] to Jerusalem that was really the
[22:43] headquarters and in the organizational
[22:46] life you've got to admit that Roman
[22:48] Catholic Church is a mother of all of it
[22:50] am she sure is and it started from
[22:53] Pentecost that's where they got to when
[22:55] they organized now we the proest are
[22:58] just little sisters off of that
[23:02] church and now let's say it would be
[23:05] there at the Vatican today are there at
[23:09] Jerusalem as it was at that day when all
[23:11] men ought to come to Jerusalem to work
[23:13] worship why did they do it in the days
[23:16] of of Jesus why did they say all man
[23:19] should worship at Jerusalem for there's
[23:21] only one place that God will fellowship
[23:24] with man that is under the blood of the
[23:27] sacrifice that's the reason they had to
[23:29] come to Jerusalem God will never meet
[23:31] with man nowhere else but under the
[23:34] blood when you turn the blood down then
[23:37] your meeting place with God has been
[23:39] taken away God made his first decision
[23:43] in the Garden of Eden that man would
[23:46] only worship him under the shed blood of
[23:48] the sacrifice and that's the only place
[23:51] that God met with man then and that's
[23:53] the only place that God ever did meet
[23:54] with man and that's the only place he
[23:56] meets with man today is under the shed
[23:58] blood of the sacrifice
