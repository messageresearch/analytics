[0:36] this church age that we're living in
[0:39] that the son of man would be revealed
[0:42] again in the same manner it was as it
[0:45] was at Sodom
[0:47] watch how historically he gave it he
[0:50] said as it was in the days first
[0:52] of Noah how they were eating drinking
[0:55] Mary and giving a marriage then he
[0:57] brought next the last the son of man and
[0:59] son that was there he was dealing with
[1:01] Jews here at Sodom he's dealing with
[1:03] Gentiles there he dreaded of all the
[1:06] water and judgment here if the Gentiles
[1:08] he burn them all at the day of sung
[1:11] that's right the Gentile World burnt
[1:13] there and so will it be when the Son of
[1:15] Man reveals there's not no more water
[1:18] but it'll be fire this time Jesus read
[1:20] from the same Genesis 23 that we read
[1:22] from it when he read about Solomon now
[1:26] we admit the conditions that spoke of
[1:29] are the world condition of Sodom
[1:31] sodomites Sodom conditions we everyone
[1:34] will say Amen to that we believe that
[1:36] all right in the spiritual condition of
[1:39] Lady arcea the church natural we'll say
[1:42] Amen to that
[1:43] and accept their signs we know that
[1:46] every sign is Earth the church is in
[1:48] laosia we know that
[1:50] we know the world is in a Sodom
[1:51] condition is that right we'll accept
[1:53] that but what about the sign of Abraham
[1:57] the one waiting for the Thomas son
[2:01] that was another remember they had a
[2:04] Sodom back there they had their
[2:05] messenger and Abraham had a messenger to
[2:08] him Abraham was waiting day by day for
[2:11] us almost an impossible thing to happen
[2:15] Sarah 90 and him 100 according to the
[2:19] promise of God he was still waiting in
[2:20] the midst of all criticism he was
[2:22] waiting for that song
[2:24] so is a True Believer
[2:26] still waiting for that promised son to
[2:29] return notice just before the sun
[2:32] arrived there was a sign given him is
[2:35] not the sign of the coming son to be
[2:38] revealed to the Royal seat of Abraham
[2:41] that's waiting for the royal son as same
[2:44] as it was to Father Abraham for the
[2:46] natural son
[2:47] and
[2:48] that right amen Jesus said so here in
[2:52] Saint Luke 17 30. before this time come
[2:57] that the son of man would be revealed
[2:59] like he did in the days of Sodom before
[3:01] the destruction of Sodom now we're
[3:04] looking for a son
[3:05] now let's take the conditions of time as
[3:07] it was in Saturn notice that all went
[3:10] out in sodomite the world
[3:13] I think one of the movie directors put
[3:15] on a picture not long ago and I got to
[3:17] see it that was Sodom if you ever see it
[3:19] there's nothing else on with that take a
[3:21] look at it it's certainly a good picture
[3:22] of the United States today
[3:24] Hollywood just exactly same kind of
[3:27] dressing everything else that they did
[3:28] is right then big drunken sprees and
[3:31] everything else a religious Cult of
[3:32] people
[3:34] so-called religious notice and Sodom had
[3:37] a witness and it was a fellow in the
[3:40] Name of Love which was just a nephew to
[3:42] to Abraham
[3:45] now Abraham did not go down in Sodom he
[3:48] and his group he had a big group with
[3:50] him enough to fight off about a dozen
[3:52] Kings in their army
[3:53] so he had a big group with him and he
[3:56] was sitting out there under an oak tree
[3:58] one day when everything was going wrong
[4:00] friend nobody had anything to do with
[4:02] him but he was still holding on to that
[4:06] promise
[4:07] watch him closely before we close
[4:11] while he was sitting there down come
[4:14] three men walking to him
[4:16] two of them went down into Sodom and
[4:19] preached the gospel to them to come out
[4:21] to love is that right
[4:23] but one stayed with Abraham
[4:26] notice the one that stayed with Abraham
[4:29] was God himself
[4:31] [Music]
[4:33] the other two were Angel Messengers
[4:37] [Music]
[4:39] and preaching the gospel always might
[4:42] Sublime I look at the set of that date
[4:45] there is a church natural
[4:47] always the threes as I said last night
[4:50] God is represented there were sodomites
[4:52] the luddites and the abrahamites
[4:57] it's in this same position tonight
[5:00] the world's setting just like that
[5:03] let me ask you something
[5:05] look at this setting up
[5:07] Abraham called this man to talk to him
[5:10] Elohim
[5:12] the Hebrew word Elohim means the
[5:16] all-sufficient one
[5:19] that one that's the Eternal one
[5:22] Elohim God himself in the beginning
[5:26] Genesis once that in beginning God take
[5:28] the Hebrew word there in a Greek word
[5:30] rather in the beginning Elohim created
[5:33] heavens and earth there he is Genesis
[5:35] about 22 here he says again or about uh
[5:38] 20 he said and he called this man's name
[5:42] Elohim
[5:44] why did he do it
[5:46] God represented in a human flesh that's
[5:49] set down with Abraham and eat a cash
[5:52] sandwich
[5:53] drinking some milk and eat some bread
[5:56] God himself has disappeared right before
[5:59] Abraham
[6:01] but he give him a sign
[6:03] notice and that sign was that he had his
[6:07] back turned to the tent and remember
[6:09] Abraham his name was Abram a few days
[6:12] before that
[6:13] and Sarah was Sarah before that
[6:17] s-a-r-r-a then
[6:19] s-a-r-a-h-m-a-b-ram to a b r a h a m
[6:22] Abraham he's father a nation
[6:25] now watch real close here
[6:28] and we'll see the setting
[6:31] all the hour that we're now living as
[6:33] Jesus told us to look for this setting
[6:35] we've seen all the rest of it right now
[6:37] let's see to the Royal Sea what setting
[6:39] they're supposed to see
[6:41] now this man said Abraham
[6:44] where is your wife Sarah
[6:48] and Abraham said she's in the tent
[6:50] behind you now you've never seen her how
[6:54] do you know that his name was Abraham
[6:57] how do you know her name was s-a-r-a-h
[7:02] Abraham where is your wife Sarah said
[7:06] she's in the tit behind you he said ah
[7:08] ah personal pronoun I am going to visit
[7:12] you according to the promise
[7:14] your wife's gonna have that baby you've
[7:16] trust me now
[7:17] I'm going to make you come to pass and
[7:20] Sarah in the tent behind eavesdropping
[7:23] or ear dropping or what you call it
[7:24] listen to the tent she said laughed up
[7:27] her sleeping she said now I'm me an old
[7:29] woman like I am have pleasured my Lord
[7:32] and him old two out there 100 years old
[7:34] while this hasn't happened for many many
[7:36] years and the man m-a-n sitting there
[7:40] eating in human flesh drinking and
[7:43] eating like an ordinary man with dust on
[7:46] his post and had dust on his feet and
[7:48] Abraham worked at all
[7:51] God himself
[7:55] looked around
[7:57] and he said why did Sarah laugh back in
[8:01] the 10th Sanders
[8:03] he knew could discern the thoughts of
[8:06] Sarah in the tent behind him
[8:09] is that right now when the Royal Seed of
[8:12] Abraham come on the earth what sign did
[8:16] he show
[8:17] it's not amazed
[8:19] Simon came up to him one day Andrew
[8:21] brought him he said your name is Simon
[8:23] you're the son of Jonas he said I made a
[8:27] Believer out of me Philip went over and
[8:29] got Nathaniel come back said come see a
[8:31] man who we have we've found Jesus of
[8:33] Nazareth son of Joseph he said now wait
[8:35] a minute could anything good come out of
[8:37] that fanaticism he said come see
[8:39] so would Philip come up in the presence
[8:41] of Jesus with Nathanael Jesus looked
[8:44] over at him and said behold in Israelite
[8:45] in whom there's no God
[8:47] he said Rabbi when did you know me he
[8:49] said before Philip calls you when you
[8:51] were out of the tree I saw you
[8:54] said rabbi
[8:56] what
[8:59] when the little woman at the well in her
[9:00] immoral condition come up a little
[9:02] panoramic something like this to draw
[9:04] some water Jesus and send his disciples
[9:06] away and get fiddles
[9:08] did it all water he said bring me a
[9:10] drink woman she said it's not customary
[9:12] for you to say that we have segregation
[9:14] here now you Jews have nothing to do
[9:16] with us Samaritans we have nothing to do
[9:18] with you he said but woman if you knew
[9:19] who you were talking to
[9:21] you'd ask me for a drink I'd give you
[9:24] Waters you don't come here to draw he
[9:26] found work condition month what it was
[9:27] he said go get your husband and come
[9:29] here she said I don't have any husband
[9:32] he said you said the truth you've had
[9:34] five and the one you're living with now
[9:35] is our church she said sir I perceive
[9:38] that power to put
[9:41] they evolved when the Messiah cometh
[9:43] he'll show us these things Jesus said I
[9:46] am he
[9:49] well that she run into the City and said
[9:51] come see a man who's told me the things
[9:53] I've done isn't this a very Messiah
[9:55] watch he did that before the Jews and
[9:59] the Samaritans but never the Gentiles
[10:02] the Gentiles we people were heathens in
[10:04] them days
[10:06] the other nations pecked the club on her
[10:08] back worshiping Islands we wasn't
[10:10] looking for no Messiah he only appears
[10:12] to those who is looking for him and we
[10:15] are supposed to be looking for him but
[10:17] those who claim to be looking for it the
[10:19] church itself when they seen that done
[10:21] they said he's a devil he's a fortune
[10:23] teller
[10:25] Jesus said that sin would be forgiven
[10:28] him because he hadn't died yet but since
[10:30] Sunday the Holy Ghost will come and do
[10:32] the same thing and to speak one word
[10:33] against it will never be forgiven that's
[10:36] this day where every word has to hang
[10:37] together speak a word against he'll
[10:40] never be forgiven in this world of the
[10:41] world to come that was the royal Seed of
[10:44] Abraham and you're that Royal Seed of
[10:47] Abraham which come because of that
[10:49] identification of that man standing
[10:50] there with Abraham come to prove it was
[10:53] the same God
[10:55] promised in this day as it was in the
[10:58] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[11:00] coming of the son of man when he is
[11:03] revealing himself as son of a man
[11:07] amen
[11:08] [Music]
[11:10] this is a day
[11:12] for the scripture to be fulfilled look
[11:15] at the setting we are today look at that
[11:17] church where the Son of God look at the
[11:18] dismalade look at all the prophecies not
[11:21] a strange thing
[11:24] our businesses are due then if the study
[11:27] has to be like it's Sovereign there were
[11:28] three of them come along three
[11:30] outstanding men sent from heaven will
[11:32] admit that
[11:33] amen three of them one state but Abraham
[11:36] they all started there but one state
[11:38] with Abraham the rest of them went out
[11:40] inside them
[11:41] is that right
[11:42] and Abraham had a changed name from
[11:44] Abram to Abraham
[11:46] true
[11:48] not one time has the history of Church
[11:51] of the world ever had an evangelist to
[11:53] go to it with a name ending in h-a-m to
[11:56] this day
[11:57] Billy g-r-a-h-a-m
[12:00] is that right
[12:02] g-r-a-h-a-m-6 letters a-b-r-a-h-a-m is
[12:06] seven letters
[12:07] but g-r-a-h-a-m is six letters which is
[12:10] the world man
[12:12] see
[12:13] look what's went out there today is that
[12:15] Messengers from heaven
[12:17] is there a man on Earth that's got
[12:19] repentance so preach so plainly as Billy
[12:22] Graham has there been a man that has had
[12:24] effects upon the people like Billy
[12:27] Graham never has there been
[12:30] internationally a man old Billy Sunday
[12:32] and so forth is here in the United
[12:33] States but Billy Graham's known
[12:35] worldwide
[12:36] see where he's calling out of Sodom
[12:40] and he's got his company party there
[12:42] with the Pentecostal Church on Oral
[12:44] Roberts
[12:45] but what about the elect group
[12:48] what kind of sign are they supposed to
[12:50] see what are they supposed to have
[12:54] Hallelujah
[12:56] it shall be
[12:59] nine times
[13:01] this day
[13:04] this scripture
[13:06] is fulfilled
[13:07] [Applause]
[13:07] [Music]
[13:09] this day
[13:11] God's promise is fulfilled
[13:15] we know that to be the truth
[13:17] he's sure tonight as he was saying
[13:21] not a preaching
[13:23] that I said a while ago if you preach
[13:25] anything and it's a gospel truth then
[13:27] God's obligated Divinity then
[13:31] is that true
[13:34] now if that be so let the god that read
[13:36] the word let the god that made the
[13:39] prophecy Let The God Who is God of the
[13:41] word come forth
[13:45] thank you
[13:46] and prove that he's still God
[13:51] as Elijah went up on the mountain
[13:52] watching Elisha went watching Elijah he
[13:55] said I want a double potion and a man
[13:58] that was only Elijah fell off on Elijah
[14:00] he walked down in double that blanket up
[14:02] and stuck the river and said where is
[14:04] the god of Elijah
[14:06] and the same thing that happened for
[14:08] Elijah happening for Elijah
[14:10] and the same gospel the same power the
[14:13] same son of man that was yesterday it is
[14:16] the day and will be forever
