[0:40] when the all night and went away how
[0:41] could they see a man a man that they had
[0:44] know to perform Miracles and raise the
[0:46] dead yet submit himself to death and
[0:49] walk up through there beating and crying
[0:51] just a spit run off his face and blood
[0:53] mixed with it where it put the handfuls
[0:55] of beard out plucked it from his face
[0:57] and wared his back till his bones of
[1:00] shining through and kicking him and
[1:01] beating him around them cussing drunken
[1:03] soldiers beating him around up the
[1:04] street and stand and let him do
[1:07] that they misunderstood so they stood
[1:09] far
[1:11] off righty Hallelujah the devil
[1:13] misunderstood him the devil said surely
[1:16] that cannot be a Son of God that would
[1:18] stand there and be mistreated like that
[1:20] and I'm cussing and my disciples down
[1:22] there just treating him any way and him
[1:23] taking it he's not the Son of God also
[1:27] the Pharisees the priest misunderstood
[1:29] he said if if thou be the Son of God
[1:31] bring yourself down off of there the
[1:33] thief on his left misunderstood you that
[1:36] if thou be the Son of God take us off
[1:38] the cross save yourself and us too but
[1:41] the thief on the right understood him he
[1:43] said we hav we've done evil and we
[1:45] deserve what we're getting but this
[1:47] man's done nothing Lord remember me when
[1:49] he come into your kingdom watch that
[1:52] voice come back today shall thou be with
[1:54] me in Paradise hallah he understood that
[1:57] that was God dying for our sins
[2:00] the only way he could die would be put
[2:02] to Death In the Flesh he can't be put to
[2:04] death in spirit because he's an eternal
[2:06] spirit and he had to be in flesh to be
[2:08] put to death so they just misunderstood
[2:11] he understood it one day about 10 days
[2:15] after
[2:15] that about 40 days after that 50 days it
[2:19] was the disciples climbed up into an
[2:22] upper room and they stayed up there for
[2:25] 10 days and night until the 50th day
[2:28] comes then all all of a sudden there
[2:30] came a sound from heaven like a rushing
[2:32] Mighty Wind because Jesus had told him
[2:35] behold I send the promise of my father
[2:38] up you but wait in the city of Jerusalem
[2:40] until you're endued with power from on
[2:42] high they know that it was going to come
[2:45] I they know it was had to happen go up
[2:48] there and wait until I send it they
[2:50] waited up there they confessed got
[2:52] everything out of their minds and hearts
[2:54] they were waiting all in one accard in
[2:56] one place waiting for the promise
[2:58] walking back and forth the man men and a
[3:00] women up there walking around together
[3:01] in this upper room all the doors barred
[3:03] so the Jews couldn't get in and hurt
[3:05] them all once they was up there walking
[3:08] around and there came a sound from
[3:10] heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind wh
[3:12] down through there and the licks of fire
[3:13] begin to set up on them the doors flew
[3:16] open the windows come open out into the
[3:18] streets they went and they were
[3:19] misunderstood amen hallelujah in so much
[3:22] as they said are these men not full of
[3:24] new wine these people are drunk because
[3:27] we hear them blabbering off something we
[3:28] don't know what they're talking about
[3:30] all at once and said how hear we ever
[3:32] men in our own language are not all
[3:33] these galileans they misunderstood that
[3:36] it was a promise of the father then God
[3:38] had a prophet there who could stand up
[3:39] and speak Peter said you men of
[3:41] Jerusalem and you that dwell in Judea
[3:43] don't misunderstand this this is that
[3:45] which is spoken up of the Prophet Joel
[3:47] and it'll come to pass in the last days
[3:49] sayth God I'll pour out my spirit upon
[3:51] all the flesh upon my hands maids and
[3:54] made servant I pour out of my spirit
[3:56] they shall prophesy I'll show wonders in
[3:58] the heavens above and and the earth
[4:00] below and fire and vapor and pillars of
[4:02] smoke it shall come to pass before the
[4:04] great and terrible day of the Lord shall
[4:05] come that whosoever shall call upon the
[4:07] name of the Lord shall be saved am it
[4:09] was a work of God it was the Holy Ghost
[4:12] but they misunderstood it he was
[4:16] misunderstood has always been
[4:18] misunderstood Israel misunderstood him
[4:20] the people in Noah's time misunderstood
[4:22] him the people in Daniel's time
[4:24] misunderstooding the people in John's
[4:26] time misunderstooding the people in and
[4:28] the prophet's time misunderstood
[4:30] the people in the Pentecostal age
[4:31] misunderstood him the people in this age
[4:34] misunderstanding it's still the same
[4:36] they don't get it because he's
[4:38] misunderstood it's trying to compare the
[4:41] natural with the
[4:42] spiritual when the people in today at
[4:44] Pentecost when it's all filled with the
[4:46] Holy Ghost had this great big meeting up
[4:48] there they called a man down there
[4:50] crippled from his mother's womb two of
[4:52] them was going along the street and this
[4:53] beggar shuck a can and ask for some
[4:55] money and he said Silver and Gold Have I
[4:58] None but such as I have I'll give it to
[5:00] you am he said in the name of Jesus
[5:03] Christ of Nazareth stand up and walk and
[5:06] he took the man with the hand and raised
[5:07] him up and immediately his feet and
[5:09] ankle bones receive strength he began
[5:11] walking and leaping then running and
[5:12] jumping and praising God went into the
[5:14] temple and all the people began to come
[5:16] together and scream and the carry on was
[5:18] unusual and they put them in ja and
[5:21] threatened them that they should not
[5:23] preach anymore in the name of Jesus am
[5:25] Peter said who should we listen to God
[5:27] or man and they turned them loose
[5:31] thinking because they whipped them a
[5:32] little bit and threaten them if they'd
[5:33] hang them the next time or burn them or
[5:35] put them on the cross or something
[5:37] they'd stop it but the next thing they
[5:39] found is right out on the street doing
[5:40] it
[5:41] again why they misunderstood was them
[5:45] people it was God in those people doing
[5:47] those things right amen when they caught
[5:49] up little Stevens at the Sanhedrin court
[5:51] that morning said we'll take him before
[5:53] this court when all these rabbis and
[5:55] Jews and high priests and holy fathers
[5:57] and all of them together out there these
[5:58] doctors of idty it'll scare him into
[6:01] wits so they brought him out in these
[6:02] chains and stood him out there a little
[6:04] fell like a lamb hun a bunch of Raving
[6:06] wolves they said watch him take down now
[6:08] and say I'll take it all back brother
[6:09] don't you all bother me he said you
[6:11] stiff necks uncircumcised my heart ear
[6:14] why do you resist the Holy Ghost like
[6:15] their father so do you amen they found
[6:18] out that it wasn't him yes boy they
[6:22] picked up clouds and throw their hands
[6:24] in their ears and begin to Nash up him
[6:26] and clot him to death and when he raised
[6:28] his head up towards that in the bats
[6:30] beating him from one side of the head
[6:31] other he said I see the heavens open and
[6:34] Jesus standing at the right hand of God
[6:37] hallelujah amen hallelujah and he fell
[6:39] asleep in the arms of the Lord Jesus
[6:41] when he died he said father lay not this
[6:43] sin to their charge yes see they
[6:46] misunderstood what they did Paul
[6:49] standing there look at it later on it
[6:51] got on his nerves and said I'm the least
[6:53] among all them because I bore witness to
[6:55] Steven's death thy Sint amen hallelujah
[6:59] that's it see people misunderstand this
[7:02] enthusiasm people misunderstand today
[7:06] hallelujah amen they misunderstand the
[7:08] power of the Holy Spirit they call it a
[7:10] bunch of Hool rers they call it a bunch
[7:12] of people that ain't got their right
[7:14] mind they misunderstand that you have to
[7:16] lose your what you call your right
[7:19] orderr because you have the mind of
[7:21] Christ you can't have the mind of the
[7:23] world in the mind of Christ at the same
[7:24] time one's carnal and the other is
[7:26] spiritual he that walks after the flesh
[7:28] is carnal
[7:30] walks the spirit is
[7:32] spiritual so I Lose Myself and find Lord
[7:37] inl yes sir amen so God's misunderstood
[7:41] it's not you that's misunderstood it's
[7:43] the Holy Spirit making you do that that
[7:46] they
[7:47] misunderstand amen they're not speaking
[7:50] against you they're speaking against him
[7:52] people are
[7:54] misunderstood now they go let them go
[7:56] but they get right back in the street
[7:57] and start again the same today they
[8:01] misunderstand the people they don't know
[8:02] what it is amen today I misunderstood in
[8:05] my Ministry that he sent me to the
[8:08] people they misunderstand me everyone of
[8:11] them said We Believe brother R I talked
[8:12] to a preacher a while ago said brother R
[8:14] we all know that you was sent to the
[8:16] church but the idea is how do you come
[8:18] baptized in Jesus
[8:20] name they misunderstand the
[8:23] scriptures they misunderstand it that's
[8:26] what he sent me for that's my purpose
[8:29] being here why do you teach the serpent
[8:31] seed and things like that that's
[8:33] contrary to what we teach well brother
[8:35] that's why I'm here they just
[8:39] misunderstanding amen but God is bearing
[8:43] record by his word and signs of the Holy
[8:47] Ghost matter how much misunderstanding
[8:50] God's confirming the word amen God's
[8:55] always been misunderstood and those who
[8:56] live with God are misunderstood with God
[8:59] because it's God working amen you
[9:03] believe it
[9:04] amen
[9:06] I
[9:07] [Music]

[9:37] [Music]
[9:40] are you glad you misunderstood amen we
[9:42] used to stand a little song saying now
[9:45] marked marked marked marked by the
[9:50] spirit Divine that's right people that
[9:52] once love me turn their back on me now
[9:56] because I'm marked marked by the spirit
[10:00] amen I lost my mind to the things of the
[10:03] world to receive the minds of Christ
[10:06] therefore if I have the mind of Christ
[10:08] my mind seeks those things which are
[10:10] above I'd like for somebody show me any
[10:13] different correct baptism besides the
[10:15] name of Jesus Christ I like for somebody
[10:17] to show me a scripture that says a
[10:19] serpent didn't have a seed I like for
[10:22] somebody to show me a scripture that
[10:23] says there's three Gods amen then they
[10:26] say well why is it God sent his message
[10:30] and Bears record of it amen he confirms
[10:34] the word with signs following amen
[10:36] hallelujah that's what the Bible says
[10:39] hallelujah they can't deny that no it's
[10:42] a fact but what do they do they
[10:44] misunderstand it because I didn't come
[10:45] in the name of the Assemblies of God the
[10:48] Oneness or the Tess or the threeness or
[10:50] the Church of God or the Baptist
[10:52] Methodist presbyter and Luther I'll come
[10:54] in none of their names I come in the
[10:57] name of Jesus Christ am
[11:00] and God by his Mercy confirms the
[11:02] message by the power of the
[11:04] Resurrection Hallelujah so it's still
[11:06] the spirit of God that the people
[11:09] misunderstand that's right misunderstood
[11:12] sure you misunderstood all that live
[11:14] Godly in Christ Jesus is misunderstood
[11:17] all the way from righteous Noah all the
[11:19] way down to the modern day Saint today
[11:21] is misunderstood always been Hallelujah
[11:24] people misunderstand it Israel
[11:25] misunderstood it they don't understand
[11:28] they just can't because they are carnal
[11:31] and spir not it won't deviate with the
[11:34] spiritual because it will not make it
[11:36] but I'm glad that we live in a kingdom
[11:40] that's not made with hands of man I'm
[11:42] glad that we're going to a kingdom that
[11:45] man had nothing to do with I'm glad that
[11:47] our kingdom is above and if our kingdom
[11:50] is above we're born from above then we
[11:52] seek those things which are above where
[11:54] Christ sits at the right hand of God oh
[11:57] where he's not ashamed of us as our
[11:59] testimony we're not ashamed of him on
