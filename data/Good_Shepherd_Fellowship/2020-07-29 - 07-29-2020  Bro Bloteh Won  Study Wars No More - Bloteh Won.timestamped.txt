[39:55] uh
[39:56] visited us here on on on on sunday
[40:00] uh our brother crazy came down from uh
[40:03] uh
[40:08] he came down from uh
[40:11] illinois he actually originally lived in
[40:15] uh
[40:15] i can sir but he drove from illinois
[40:18] through the night
[40:19] uh just to come down and have service
[40:22] with us i want for us to
[40:24] to remember him we we had a privilege to
[40:28] talk with him and
[40:29] after the service there they had some
[40:32] serious situation there
[40:34] that we need the grace of god to come on
[40:36] the scene for our brother
[40:38] and he have some health issue
[40:42] that is that is uh that is
[40:46] overtaking his mind in a sense word
[40:49] i mean he sometimes will say some things
[40:52] and
[40:53] not actually together so we want to
[40:56] want to pray for him i had a privilege
[40:58] to talk to his wife
[41:00] and also to his pastor to get to know
[41:03] what the situation
[41:04] is now but i will use that platform
[41:08] tonight
[41:09] since uh we're going to remember our
[41:12] brother in prayer
[41:15] i just saw the text message from another
[41:17] young man
[41:18] he has come true here a few couple of
[41:20] times he's down
[41:22] in waterloo young brother john some of
[41:25] you know him
[41:26] and the last time we stopped over in
[41:30] waterloo i tried to get a hold of him
[41:32] and i was not getting the hold of him i
[41:34] knew the young man was was in trouble
[41:37] trouble not as a sense of being in jail
[41:39] or with the police
[41:41] the greatest trouble you can be in is
[41:43] sin trouble
[41:44] praise the lord amen when sin is after
[41:47] you you
[41:48] know that was what god told king and he
[41:50] says
[41:51] make your way right or as sin will be
[41:53] after you
[41:54] that's what god told him sin is at your
[41:57] door
[41:58] you know it will be after you praise the
[42:01] lord the only
[42:02] place to have from sin is under the
[42:04] blood
[42:05] amen the only place to have from sin is
[42:08] on
[42:08] at the foot of the cross praise the lord
[42:11] if you leave that place sin is going to
[42:14] chase you
[42:15] amen and you know like brother branham
[42:17] said he says it will carry you
[42:19] far then you want to stay father you
[42:22] want to go
[42:23] it will keep you longer than you want to
[42:25] stay so i knew
[42:27] that a young man was in trouble because
[42:30] he will always pick up my phone calling
[42:32] and i'll call him several times later he
[42:35] will not pick my phone call
[42:38] and so i had a privilege to call him the
[42:41] other day
[42:42] i said well maybe if i use a different
[42:44] phone number he will know that his
[42:45] brother won
[42:46] and so that's exactly what i did and he
[42:48] picked it up
[42:50] and i stuck him to the gun and said
[42:52] young man
[42:53] what's wrong with you what are you
[42:55] refusing to pick up my phone
[42:58] you know but finally we were able to
[43:00] address the situation he needs our
[43:02] prayer
[43:04] and he needs our prayer
[43:07] so just like i said while we we
[43:11] we all approach the throne of grace
[43:13] tonight
[43:14] i want to encourage you i want to
[43:16] encourage each and every one of us
[43:18] most especially most especially our
[43:21] young people
[43:22] most especially our young people i want
[43:25] to
[43:26] i want to encourage you we have this
[43:29] grace
[43:30] we have this opportunity you know
[43:33] wednesday night sunday morning
[43:38] don't don't take it lightly you know
[43:40] don't take it like
[43:42] you know a place that you get so used to
[43:46] coming
[43:47] because uh one of the days you might not
[43:49] have this
[43:50] opportunity you know and
[43:54] uh if there are things that are
[43:57] bothering you
[43:58] there is a god in heaven james said in
[44:01] the scripture
[44:03] he says if our heart condemned us now
[44:07] we have confidence with god he said but
[44:10] even if
[44:11] our heart condemn us god is greater than
[44:14] our heart
[44:16] so you don't you don't allow that
[44:18] condemnation to frustrate you
[44:20] you don't allow that condemnation to
[44:22] take you away
[44:24] from god that is greater than your heart
[44:27] god that is better than the condemnation
[44:31] you don't you don't allow that you know
[44:34] you don't allow that when you have
[44:36] trouble and and
[44:37] uh maybe you you allow things in your
[44:40] life you do things that you're not
[44:42] supposed to do
[44:43] run to the truth of mercy because you
[44:44] always find mercy there
[44:46] there is still blood
[44:50] there is still that blood that speak at
[44:53] better things
[44:56] we know that one of these days that
[44:58] blood will normally be
[45:00] on the throne so there is no amount of
[45:03] prayer you can pray at that time that
[45:05] would be heard
[45:07] but now that we say grace and mercy
[45:12] praise the lord so while we remember
[45:14] these few needs
[45:16] you know we want to pray for brother
[45:18] christ uh
[45:20] you know my heart really go out to the
[45:23] brother
[45:24] i mean he and his wife have six children
[45:27] and i mean he's away from his children
[45:30] and
[45:31] uh with everything that is going on
[45:34] and uh you know how sometimes
[45:39] you you get you get you get caught into
[45:42] a situation where
[45:44] you think that you can help the person
[45:46] you know and
[45:48] and after i had a little time to to step
[45:50] back a little bit and pray
[45:52] i thought i said well i think the right
[45:54] thing to do
[45:56] is to speak with his pastor and get to
[45:58] know what the situation
[46:00] is you know because if you don't go back
[46:04] to the root of the situation there is no
[46:06] way you can help this situation
[46:09] so let's pray for brother christ let's
[46:11] pray for brother christ and
[46:14] let's pray for brother john young
[46:16] brother john over there in waterloo
[46:19] these brothers need the grace of god and
[46:23] let's commit them in the hands of the
[46:24] lord
[46:26] uh let's pray for those two brothers
[46:30] over in china that are in praising
[46:34] let's commit them in the hands of the
[46:35] lord as well
[46:37] and praise the lord
[46:40] amen is there any other unspoken prayer
[46:44] requests you want to
[46:46] uh just lift it up to the lord
[46:50] by the up raising hands let's just uh
[46:56] praise the lord

[57:38] oh
[57:44] [Music]
[57:52] oh
[57:56] [Music]
[58:01] let's just sing that one more time
[58:03] [Music]
[58:06] oh
[58:09] [Music]
[58:11] [Laughter]
[58:14] [Music]
[58:20] hey the lordly
[58:37] [Music]
[59:02] yes
[59:04] [Music]
[59:46] can you imagine a desired experience
[59:51] when he went into the house of the lord
[59:59] the first time he will be able to break
[1:00:01] into a vision or the trance
[1:00:05] to see the kind of a reverence that the
[1:00:08] angels bring to god
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:15] the first time he will be able to break
[1:00:18] into a trance
[1:00:19] and see the kind of a reverence
[1:00:23] the kind of a reverence
[1:00:28] that the angels bring to god
[1:00:33] in all that he knew as
[1:00:37] keeping the lord or righteousness or
[1:00:41] whatever he
[1:00:42] think he was doing right he said war is
[1:00:45] me
[1:00:46] woe is me for i'm undone
[1:01:00] oh
[1:01:05] you are
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:19] the lord bless you thank you musicians
[1:01:25] you see that's the reason why god had to
[1:01:27] take the form of a man
[1:01:32] because even the angels
[1:01:37] that's the reason why it's a mystery
[1:01:43] because
[1:01:48] the way the angels know
[1:01:51] of god's holiness
[1:02:00] it had to be a mystery it has to come
[1:02:03] in a way of a man and come
[1:02:07] by the weight of a birthing and all of
[1:02:09] that and natural birth and all of that
[1:02:12] uh even the angels wouldn't have
[1:02:14] accepted
[1:02:16] that the god of heaven
[1:02:20] praise the lord god of heaven
[1:02:24] in his state of holiness
[1:02:30] to be associated with what the situation
[1:02:32] the word
[1:02:33] was in praise the lord
[1:02:37] and
[1:02:42] here we have this opportunity to come
[1:02:45] into his presence
[1:02:46] to approach him like uh paul said in the
[1:02:50] book of hebrew by a new living way
[1:02:53] you know we we have to come and approach
[1:02:55] him
[1:02:56] you know uh just just listening to
[1:02:59] brother brahm
[1:02:59] tonight he says god don't even he don't
[1:03:02] even look at
[1:03:03] us he don't even listen to us he's
[1:03:06] listening to the blood
[1:03:08] that's right amen he's listening to the
[1:03:10] blood
[1:03:12] that's the reason why if our prayers are
[1:03:14] not lined up with the word of god
[1:03:16] i mean they just hit the wall and dash
[1:03:18] to the floor it has to be lined up with
[1:03:20] the word because god listening to the
[1:03:21] blood
[1:03:22] you know he's listening to the blood
[1:03:25] i mean like james said how can you bring
[1:03:28] uh
[1:03:28] uh on pure water and pure water from the
[1:03:31] same fountain
[1:03:32] you know how will god listen to us i
[1:03:35] mean we tell lies with this tongue we i
[1:03:37] mean we tell things that we should not
[1:03:39] talk with this stone
[1:03:40] how will he listen to that it has to
[1:03:42] come through the blood
[1:03:45] it has to come through the blood he's
[1:03:47] listening to the blood amen
[1:03:49] are you glad tonight there's a blood
[1:03:50] that speak better things on our behalf
[1:03:53] praise the lord amen the lord bless you
[1:03:56] tonight and
[1:03:57] let you stand on our feet and
[1:04:03] my goodness

[1:07:57] amen we just we just thank the lord and
[1:08:01] and uh i i want to take a little
[1:08:05] uh thought tonight actually i will be
[1:08:08] i'll be speaking on
[1:08:10] uh the mountain of the lost house
[1:08:15] that is established in the top of the
[1:08:17] mountains you know we've been speaking
[1:08:19] the mountains these few days amen
[1:08:21] praise the lord mean i'm i want to keep
[1:08:24] i want to keep our mind
[1:08:25] in there because there are a lot of
[1:08:27] attraction you know i was thinking about
[1:08:29] it the mountain of the lord house in the
[1:08:31] top of the mountain
[1:08:32] you know god gave noah
[1:08:36] an instruction to build those build the
[1:08:39] act
[1:08:39] you know exact measurement and
[1:08:42] everything
[1:08:43] you know and when noah did that it
[1:08:45] pleased the lord
[1:08:46] so well i mean he came down
[1:08:49] in his in his mercy and i mean
[1:08:53] he just blessed noah and and those
[1:08:56] animals in the act praise the lord you
[1:08:58] see following god's instruction
[1:09:01] exactly as god said give noah
[1:09:04] the the privilege to experience what it
[1:09:07] was with adam and eve
[1:09:10] amen because as long as the
[1:09:14] those animals came on a noah's anointing
[1:09:18] the the the presence of the holy ghost
[1:09:22] i mean the lion and the lamb the goat
[1:09:26] and all of that they could all
[1:09:28] fellowship
[1:09:30] i mean evil was taken away
[1:09:35] they went right into the ark
[1:09:39] can you can you imagine what it was for
[1:09:42] even
[1:09:42] noah's psalms says
[1:09:47] father i are you sure are you sure that
[1:09:51] liar not tricking us
[1:09:54] oh no son you can go and rob you can go
[1:09:57] and wrap it on the head
[1:10:00] and it's just not a one bit thing that
[1:10:02] got into the act the door is shut
[1:10:05] man the door is shut
[1:10:10] god had to keep evil out of that act
[1:10:13] because
[1:10:14] his sin will go down there noah bones
[1:10:17] will be the one that will
[1:10:18] that will come after the flood
[1:10:23] but you think about it now that act was
[1:10:26] the lost house
[1:10:30] it was the lord's house and where did
[1:10:32] the egg landed
[1:10:34] on top of the mountain the law house on
[1:10:36] top of the mountain
[1:10:44] the lord now the lost house
[1:10:48] on top of the mountain with peace
[1:10:51] in the ark the lion and the lamb
[1:10:55] lied together what is the picture that
[1:10:57] is in your mind
[1:11:00] a foretaste of the millennium
[1:11:03] a full taste of the one day rest
[1:11:06] and four taste of what adam had
[1:11:11] praise the lord
[1:11:15] so even if if if if
[1:11:18] no one just had a record
[1:11:22] if he just had a record
[1:11:30] if he just had a record of adam
[1:11:34] and and and and and e-belt and seth
[1:11:37] and and i mean and everything that
[1:11:39] happened in the eating
[1:11:40] in in the garden of eden if you just had
[1:11:42] a record just like you and myself had a
[1:11:45] record
[1:11:47] of how adam named those animals
[1:11:50] you know what and and and brother
[1:11:52] branham will bring us
[1:11:54] a drama and tell us you know uh uh he'll
[1:11:57] look at
[1:11:57] the the the the lion the cheetah and all
[1:12:00] of those animals
[1:12:01] and and he just rubbed them by the head
[1:12:03] and and this was when sin
[1:12:05] has not been introduced yet
[1:12:09] praise the lord so if i if noah just had
[1:12:12] a record that he read
[1:12:17] and to see that they have to use balls
[1:12:22] and and arrows and spears to be able to
[1:12:25] chase those
[1:12:26] animals down to hunt them and after they
[1:12:29] kill them
[1:12:30] they look like wow drop it whoa
[1:12:34] it's dead that's why they were doing it
[1:12:36] the animal is dead they
[1:12:37] have already killed it and they admire
[1:12:40] it oh it's beautiful
[1:12:43] but when they see a living one they run
[1:12:45] away
[1:12:48] and you always sting in his mind and
[1:12:50] says man
[1:12:52] i wonder what it was this is you know
[1:12:55] said because i i call into history uh
[1:12:59] enoch was the one that gave us the first
[1:13:02] first language
[1:13:05] there were records that was passed down
[1:13:09] you know passed down it was it was all
[1:13:12] it was all
[1:13:12] oral history so if god did not give
[1:13:16] moses
[1:13:16] a vision we will not have accuracy
[1:13:22] so what the account that moses wrote in
[1:13:25] genesis was by vision
[1:13:27] or s we will not have accuracy
[1:13:32] but yet noah thinking in his mind wow
[1:13:38] well maybe he saw the lion trying to
[1:13:41] jump on his prey and he said you are
[1:13:45] lying
[1:13:46] maybe that's why adam saw but no
[1:13:50] adam will call them
[1:13:56] and he will you pet them
[1:14:00] rub your head come on boy
[1:14:03] go ahead go and play
[1:14:08] but here is nowhere here
[1:14:12] after obeying the voice of god
[1:14:16] following god's instruction to build an
[1:14:19] act
[1:14:22] he's having the privilege of
[1:14:25] experiencing
[1:14:26] what adam experienced
[1:14:31] praise the lord
[1:14:34] those animals going into the act two
[1:14:38] by pairs they went into the ark
[1:14:41] noah his wife his sons and dear wives
[1:14:45] went into the act
[1:14:46] and the bible says god closed the door
[1:14:51] god shut the door and i believe that was
[1:14:54] the same way in eden
[1:14:56] god shut the door
[1:14:59] until genesis 3 amen
[1:15:03] praise the lord
[1:15:07] now so get the picture now this is the
[1:15:09] house of god
[1:15:11] the tabernacle of god
[1:15:14] the act of noah was the tabernacle of
[1:15:16] god because
[1:15:18] god the creator of heaven and earth had
[1:15:20] to be present in that act
[1:15:22] for all his creature to be at their best
[1:15:28] amen that's the only time we are at our
[1:15:31] best
[1:15:31] when god is present
[1:15:35] praise the lord we're the best in age
[1:15:38] best in attitude we are
[1:15:41] at our best when god is present
[1:15:49] praise the lord the house of the lord
[1:15:53] on top of the mountain the boat
[1:15:57] sailed went through the flood and
[1:15:59] everything
[1:16:00] and landed on top of the mountain
[1:16:05] praise the lord
[1:16:10] in 40 days and forty night
[1:16:13] the rain fell the tunnel rolled the boat
[1:16:17] went
[1:16:17] up and down and everything that was
[1:16:21] happening
[1:16:24] noah his sons the animals they would
[1:16:26] stay at their best
[1:16:29] water fellowship god sustained him
[1:16:34] god feared him he had talked
[1:16:37] because if the lion gets hungry you
[1:16:39] start eating animals
[1:16:41] so god sustained them i love that
[1:16:45] praise the lord amen
[1:16:53] i thought to to grab your attention with
[1:16:55] this
[1:16:56] tonight i want to

[1:17:03] here tonight
[1:17:04] and i'll continue if if the law is well
[1:17:06] on sunday
[1:17:08] and uh uh well down here were
[1:17:12] isaiah said uh
[1:17:15] verse 4 and they and he shall judge
[1:17:18] among the nation
[1:17:19] and shall rebuke many people and they
[1:17:22] shall
[1:17:23] shall beat their swords into plot shares
[1:17:26] and
[1:17:27] and their spears into pruning hawks
[1:17:30] because we were plant
[1:17:32] in the in in in the millennium so this
[1:17:35] is a millennium promise
[1:17:36] a man instead of using swallow to hunt
[1:17:39] people down they will use it to plant
[1:17:43] praise the lord
[1:17:46] and uh
[1:17:53] nations shall not live upswall against
[1:17:56] nation
[1:17:57] neither shall they learn war anymore
[1:18:00] pray to the lord so while just you know
[1:18:03] kind of for
[1:18:04] a little thought here steady wars no
[1:18:06] more
[1:18:07] amen that's our future
[1:18:11] that is the future that we must be
[1:18:13] living for
[1:18:16] amen a future where they will
[1:18:19] land wars no more they will study wars
[1:18:22] normal
[1:18:25] because right now in this in this in
[1:18:28] this uh
[1:18:29] uh time that we are living in that's why
[1:18:32] we are hearing all of this
[1:18:34] language of superpower they are studying
[1:18:36] walls
[1:18:37] they are studying you know men are
[1:18:40] starting making
[1:18:41] atomic bombs just to be able to have an
[1:18:44] edge over another nation
[1:18:48] praise the lord
[1:18:52] you know i was reading through uh uh
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:57] isaiah chapter 1
[1:19:04] and it speaks here in verse 2 year o
[1:19:07] heavens and give
[1:19:09] ears o earth for the lord have spoken
[1:19:13] i have i have nourished and brought up
[1:19:16] children
[1:19:16] and they have rebelled against me their
[1:19:19] ox
[1:19:19] nowhere his owner their ass his master
[1:19:23] creep but
[1:19:24] israel does not know my people does not
[1:19:27] consider a sinful nation a people living
[1:19:31] with iniquity the sea of evildoers
[1:19:34] children that are corrupt they have
[1:19:37] forsaken
[1:19:38] the law they have provoked the holy one
[1:19:41] the holy one of israel unto anger
[1:19:44] they are gone away backward
[1:19:49] now i was thinking about this and and
[1:19:51] and just before i left the office there
[1:19:53] was
[1:19:53] there was a scripture that struck my
[1:19:55] mind i was not able to get to it
[1:19:58] but there in the in the book of isaiah
[1:20:00] somewhere in one of those prophets
[1:20:01] the bible was talking about jerusalem
[1:20:04] and and scripture said
[1:20:05] jerusalem one time was admired by all
[1:20:09] the nations around her
[1:20:12] when it went into captivity
[1:20:15] they got an evil name
[1:20:20] and everybody that look at the city
[1:20:22] cursed the city
[1:20:23] one time in the reign of solomon
[1:20:27] the time of david i mean when when when
[1:20:30] israel had
[1:20:32] kings that were gulf hearing
[1:20:35] jerusalem had a name
[1:20:39] now the reason why i was thinking on
[1:20:41] that scripture
[1:20:42] because i was bringing it home
[1:20:47] one time america had a name
[1:20:53] this was the nation that uh
[1:20:56] that two tribes in the country could not
[1:20:58] fight america
[1:21:00] the the the the the senate goes and
[1:21:02] talks about it
[1:21:03] they i mean they come to a resolution
[1:21:06] they send
[1:21:06] a a a word to the people they will send
[1:21:09] army down there to seize the
[1:21:11] the fight i mean they were just like a
[1:21:14] big brother told the world
[1:21:19] but we almost now having riot in every
[1:21:22] city
[1:21:27] we're having riot in every setting
[1:21:32] people possessed by evil spirit
[1:21:36] and now you know let me let me say this
[1:21:39] to you
[1:21:40] young people then that's the reason why
[1:21:42] i continue to encourage you don't fill
[1:21:44] your mind with the media
[1:21:46] you will get a wrong spirit on you
[1:21:48] because
[1:21:49] the reason there is that prophecy
[1:21:53] is what driving this world what god said
[1:21:56] will come to pass will come to pass
[1:21:59] nobody can stop it
[1:22:03] your ambitions and your desires cannot
[1:22:06] control god's word
[1:22:11] it's what driving us to the place that
[1:22:14] we
[1:22:14] are brother branham says rock and roll
[1:22:19] will prepare them for armageddon
[1:22:24] meaning that the music that they will be
[1:22:27] listening to all
[1:22:28] will just be violent music
[1:22:32] that is that's the thing that is putting
[1:22:34] all of these young people on the street
[1:22:36] is the music that they are listening to
[1:22:38] all those rap music
[1:22:41] evil spirits
[1:22:55] just like jerusalem one time it was
[1:22:58] admired i mean
[1:22:59] i i mean you you you we read about the
[1:23:02] queen of solomon i mean
[1:23:03] it was not only the queen of solomon
[1:23:05] there were queens and kings
[1:23:06] that was coming coming from around the
[1:23:09] world that time
[1:23:10] to hear the wisdom of solomon they
[1:23:12] wanted to get down there to jerusalem
[1:23:15] on the date of pentecost what was
[1:23:17] happening when those when those
[1:23:19] disciples
[1:23:20] came out they started speaking in
[1:23:21] tongues and and everybody the bible says
[1:23:24] everybody every nation under heaven was
[1:23:27] represented in jerusalem at that time
[1:23:34] people were sending their children to
[1:23:36] jerusalem to learn
[1:23:41] to learn the wisdom of of the jews
[1:23:49] just like how an american citizenship
[1:23:52] is it's a proud thing that's just how
[1:23:55] being in jerusalem even though at that
[1:23:58] time
[1:23:58] it was ruled or controlled by a roman
[1:24:01] empire that that is that is daniel
[1:24:03] prophecy
[1:24:06] but it still had his glory
[1:24:10] just like rome was was ruling jerusalem
[1:24:13] they were ruling other parts of the
[1:24:15] world
[1:24:15] but jerusalem was the place of
[1:24:18] attraction
[1:24:27] praise the lord amen
[1:24:41] learn from the story of of ruth
[1:24:45] now meaning her friend after their
[1:24:48] husband and dad
[1:24:49] they wanted to go back to jerusalem they
[1:24:52] wanted some kind of
[1:24:56] identity
[1:24:58] because there was just something about
[1:25:00] the place there was something about the
[1:25:03] place and the thing that was about the
[1:25:04] place
[1:25:05] it was because god identified himself
[1:25:08] with that city
[1:25:13] amen he identified himself with that
[1:25:15] city
[1:25:22] praise the lord but it came
[1:25:26] a time when the people forsook the word
[1:25:29] of god
[1:25:30] and they started learning the ways of
[1:25:32] all the nations
[1:25:33] around them they start trying their gods
[1:25:37] and and and and and all their
[1:25:40] craftousness and
[1:25:41] and start going in and and to
[1:25:43] divinations and getting themselves
[1:25:45] involved with
[1:25:46] with spirits that they don't even know
[1:25:52] about
[1:26:01] the glory of god departed
[1:26:07] the glory of god departed a few
[1:26:10] few weeks ago for one one of this night
[1:26:12] i was i was i was just meditating
[1:26:15] and reading uh i was reading one of my
[1:26:17] devotionals that i have on on charles
[1:26:19] pardon he said something very
[1:26:21] that thing struck me i mean it kept me
[1:26:23] up the whole night
[1:26:28] in his days he called him the preachers
[1:26:30] of preacher
[1:26:32] he said this he said the most
[1:26:38] holy man the most holy man the most
[1:26:42] righteous man he says when god
[1:26:46] lifts his grace from on you you will
[1:26:47] become the most
[1:26:49] sinful man
[1:27:01] he said if god lift his grace from you
[1:27:05] you will do things that you never
[1:27:07] believe you can do
[1:27:13] so it pays to seek the grace and mercy
[1:27:15] of god
[1:27:19] and not to get proud in our ways
[1:27:25] because when god lift his hands
[1:27:29] from on you
[1:27:34] and that's what happened to jerusalem
[1:27:36] that i mean the city was wasted
[1:27:39] we know when rihabram came the cedar was
[1:27:41] splitted
[1:27:42] 10 tribes to to to to to israel
[1:27:46] two tribes left with judah and because
[1:27:48] of david's sake
[1:27:54] why because that city jerusalem that
[1:27:57] very city jerusalem
[1:27:58] that was a city where abraham sacrificed
[1:28:02] isaac on the mountain that was the very
[1:28:05] city
[1:28:07] david was the one that made that city
[1:28:10] the capital of israel
[1:28:14] when he brought the tabernacle in the
[1:28:16] city of jerusalem
[1:28:18] and built the tabernacle of david
[1:28:21] and named zion
[1:28:24] to be the centerplace because of that
[1:28:28] a man after god's own heart the thing
[1:28:31] there
[1:28:32] that that that impresses god
[1:28:35] david said ah i'm on a house of cedar
[1:28:41] and the ark of the lord
[1:28:44] that was the thing that moves god his
[1:28:46] desire
[1:28:48] even though he will not be the one to
[1:28:50] build the temple
[1:28:52] but his desire
[1:28:56] and just saying i mean i mean you took
[1:28:59] me from the ship called
[1:29:00] you took me from and and you have placed
[1:29:03] me you have given me the name in the
[1:29:05] earth and and you you have established
[1:29:07] me see
[1:29:08] see the kind of a roof i'm honored and
[1:29:10] the
[1:29:11] tabernacle the ark of the lord is
[1:29:14] on the tent the ark of the lord is away
[1:29:17] from
[1:29:17] israel that was the thing that attracted
[1:29:20] the god of heaven
[1:29:24] when a man has regard to the word of god
[1:29:31] when a man has regard to the word of god
[1:29:38] putting the word above our necessary
[1:29:43] needs
[1:29:49] it is that desire that god
[1:29:53] that it please god
[1:29:56] that even when he said it to nathan the
[1:29:58] prophet the prophet had no
[1:30:01] he had no second thought but to tell him
[1:30:03] david
[1:30:05] do all that is within your heart because
[1:30:06] the lord is rebelling
[1:30:09] praise the lord amen
[1:30:13] the prophet never even took a second
[1:30:15] thought
[1:30:16] until god has to visit him that night
[1:30:18] say no go back
[1:30:19] go back and tell david
[1:30:22] i had this thing all plain
[1:30:27] praise the lord but that was the thing
[1:30:29] that attracted god
[1:30:33] david wanted a house of god right in the
[1:30:35] city of jerusalem
[1:30:37] on the mount
[1:30:41] he wanted for the tabernacle of god to
[1:30:43] be
[1:30:44] exalted above all the houses in israel
[1:30:47] you can be down and look on the hill
[1:30:49] and says that is the house of the lord
[1:30:51] god
[1:30:53] that was what he wanted
[1:30:58] praise the lord
[1:31:01] and god
[1:31:06] took that place to heart
[1:31:09] because a man had a heart for god
[1:31:13] god looked down upon that place
[1:31:17] he says and and it was because of that
[1:31:19] he kept judah
[1:31:22] and if you read the history of the kings
[1:31:24] you realize
[1:31:25] the kings of israel they kept going into
[1:31:28] idolatry and idolatry and idolatry
[1:31:31] the kings of judah they were straight
[1:31:34] and god would bring one righteous king
[1:31:36] they would strain and god would bring
[1:31:38] one righteous king
[1:31:41] it was israel that was captured by the
[1:31:44] assyrian
[1:31:45] that's how this that's how samaritan was
[1:31:47] born
[1:31:50] but all along god kept judah
[1:31:58] he said i have to keep a light in judah
[1:32:01] because of my seventh david's sake
[1:32:09] a man who realized
[1:32:14] that all that he has become
[1:32:17] it was god that made it to him
[1:32:21] all he had he owe it to god and he was
[1:32:24] willing to give
[1:32:25] everything back to the one that gave it
[1:32:29] to him
[1:32:30] is that not the same thing of father
[1:32:32] abraham
[1:32:34] ready to give everything to the one that
[1:32:37] gave it to him
[1:32:40] we together praise the lord
[1:32:47] and we have to know that god
[1:32:50] established an everlasting covenant with
[1:32:54] david
[1:32:58] and everlasting in a sense as long as
[1:33:01] the earth remains david
[1:33:02] you will always have a seed on the
[1:33:05] throne
[1:33:07] an everlasting coveting
[1:33:12] even if your children heard that's what
[1:33:14] god said
[1:33:15] even if your children earth oh my
[1:33:18] goodness my head is spinning tonight
[1:33:20] praise the lord even if your children
[1:33:23] heard
[1:33:23] i'll leave that one for another day
[1:33:27] amen he says
[1:33:30] i will still keep
[1:33:34] i will find a way to redeem them to
[1:33:38] myself
[1:33:40] to still keep a seed on the throne
[1:33:43] because of my seven david's sake
[1:33:47] so this promise that he gave
[1:33:50] to david was an everlasting promise
[1:33:54] and from generation to generation the
[1:33:57] promise
[1:33:58] i mean god kept raising up a a
[1:34:02] man from the house of david from
[1:34:06] the sea lion of david because
[1:34:09] this promise was going
[1:34:12] is going all the way to the millennium
[1:34:18] amen is going all the way to the
[1:34:20] millennium
[1:34:23] this house of the lord that is
[1:34:26] established on top of the mountain
[1:34:31] now you have to realize now that the
[1:34:33] lord god does not dwell in temple means
[1:34:35] made with hands we will get into that
[1:34:39] because the millennium temples is not
[1:34:42] temple made with hands
[1:34:44] amen that is in daniel vision we will
[1:34:48] get to that as we
[1:34:49] as we uh as we travel together
[1:34:52] i mean um in a way that god speaks here
[1:34:56] uh the the scripture says uh in verse 3
[1:34:59] and many people shall come and and come
[1:35:02] up
[1:35:03] and say come here and let us go up to
[1:35:05] the house of the lord
[1:35:06] and right in here the bible talks about
[1:35:10] the nations we speak about the gentiles
[1:35:12] that in verse 4
[1:35:14] and he shall george among the nations
[1:35:16] speaking about the gentiles
[1:35:18] now it shows how the gentiles
[1:35:21] have been brought how the gentiles
[1:35:25] are being brought into the promise
[1:35:29] of david now you have to remember
[1:35:32] that there were gentile men that stood
[1:35:35] with david
[1:35:38] in the days that he was a fugitive
[1:35:42] praise the lord that is the reason why
[1:35:46] in acts chapter 13 when they were
[1:35:48] arguing
[1:35:49] about not arguing but they were
[1:35:51] discussing about
[1:35:53] whether the gentiles before they can be
[1:35:55] brought into the church there should be
[1:35:56] second side on that
[1:35:58] james said brothers you got to be
[1:35:59] careful when god spoke about the
[1:36:02] tabernacle of david
[1:36:04] he was talking about these people
[1:36:11] you have to know that there were men all
[1:36:13] the men that was standing with saul
[1:36:15] they were all they were they were all uh
[1:36:17] uh uh the men of the ahmed of israel
[1:36:19] they were all
[1:36:20] uh uh hebrew boys
[1:36:23] and they were seeking to kill their own
[1:36:25] brother
[1:36:26] and yet these gentile people that were
[1:36:29] not
[1:36:29] in the covenant of abraham for what
[1:36:32] reason
[1:36:33] they were anointed to stand with david
[1:36:41] i will tell you something that might
[1:36:43] shock you a little bit
[1:36:45] you won't pass out
[1:36:48] praise the lord but do you know
[1:36:51] that even the very men
[1:36:54] that were that were they were protecting
[1:36:57] the house of
[1:36:58] of of of david they were all gentiles
[1:37:03] uriah was gentile amen
[1:37:08] and they saw what david did to uriah but
[1:37:11] they
[1:37:11] never lift up their arm
[1:37:14] against david
[1:37:19] they never said oh he killed our brother
[1:37:21] we were revenge on
[1:37:22] them never
[1:37:26] because they had respect
[1:37:30] onto the office they have respect
[1:37:34] onto the anointing
[1:37:37] are we together a lot of things i could
[1:37:41] go into into that but i'll leave it for
[1:37:42] you for another time
[1:37:44] i want to get get our attention to this
[1:37:46] a little bit here
[1:37:50] so god
[1:37:54] kept a place for the gentiles
[1:38:00] he kept a place for the gentiles
[1:38:07] david praying and saying my god my god
[1:38:10] why have thou forsaken me
[1:38:13] but abraham says it's too bad and says
[1:38:15] how can they ever say this
[1:38:17] we are here david nobody can play time
[1:38:19] with you
[1:38:20] they did not understand they were not in
[1:38:23] the coveted
[1:38:25] but they were driven
[1:38:28] they were driven by purpose they were
[1:38:31] driving
[1:38:34] those men were ready to race their life
[1:38:36] bring david a cup of water
[1:38:39] when he saw how much the data he pulled
[1:38:41] down to the ground
[1:38:42] for a drink offering
[1:38:49] so god was thinking about you and myself
[1:38:53] because of what our fathers did
[1:38:59] praise the lord
[1:39:04] remember bannon one time in the prayer
[1:39:05] line he hired a little
[1:39:08] black girl that was blind
[1:39:13] and he held her so dear to his heart and
[1:39:16] said father
[1:39:18] remember when you were on the road to
[1:39:21] calvary
[1:39:22] one of our ancestors helped you
[1:39:28] for simon's sake give her her sight
[1:39:31] god remember
[1:39:34] he always remember
[1:39:39] we are enjoying the benefit we are
[1:39:41] enjoying the knowledge
[1:39:43] of the messiah we are enjoying the
[1:39:45] knowledge of the mystery of god
[1:39:48] because there were men not even knowing
[1:39:51] what they were fighting for but they
[1:39:52] were fighting
[1:39:57] they got so attached to this man david
[1:40:02] he did not rob them
[1:40:06] they believed his story more than even
[1:40:08] his brothers believe his story
[1:40:11] because david's story inspired those men
[1:40:14] when david keep telling them about
[1:40:15] killing the lion
[1:40:16] they all wanted to kill the lion until
[1:40:19] one had to jump in the snow
[1:40:24] and he killed the lion and he came out
[1:40:26] with his testimony
[1:40:28] because they believed david story
[1:40:32] are we together praise the lord
[1:40:40] but we have all of these things going on
[1:40:45] we have our mission this nation we have
[1:40:49] the word as a whole
[1:40:51] in chaos the whole word is in chaos
[1:40:56] the whole word noun is in a birth pain
[1:41:00] all of these things that is happening
[1:41:02] the word is in
[1:41:04] a birth pain
[1:41:10] that's the reason why nothing makes
[1:41:11] sense
[1:41:15] praise the lord
[1:41:18] that's why nothing makes sense
[1:41:24] what is happening to the world is just
[1:41:26] like the crave
[1:41:28] of a woman that is in birth pain or the
[1:41:30] crave of a woman that is caring child
[1:41:34] they asking max the accent sanitation
[1:41:37] they ask
[1:41:38] so it's a sign of birth being the word
[1:41:41] is going through birth pains
[1:41:43] praise the lord
[1:41:50] it's about the world is about to
[1:41:55] to to give birth
[1:42:01] to the city that abraham
[1:42:05] was looking for not me with hints
[1:42:10] praise the lord
[1:42:15] and i was reading this scripture the
[1:42:17] other day
[1:42:18] and and and studying about it
[1:42:26] were there was steady walls no more
[1:42:30] praise the lord you know if a person has
[1:42:33] ever been
[1:42:34] in an era of violence or riot or
[1:42:37] you know any form of violence
[1:42:42] whenever violence are repeating
[1:42:45] it has a way to trouble you
[1:42:54] i mean most of the people that are
[1:42:55] running in the street and burning places
[1:42:58] down
[1:42:59] uh uh they really don't know what they
[1:43:01] are doing
[1:43:02] they are just they are just overtaken by
[1:43:05] an evil spirit
[1:43:08] they're not fighting for no purpose
[1:43:11] they are now rioting for nothing that is
[1:43:14] right they are just possessed by an evil
[1:43:22] spirit
[1:43:24] because they are doing it more of of of
[1:43:27] hurt and all of that
[1:43:28] but what i'm saying tonight is that
[1:43:34] we have a city
[1:43:39] where there will be no more war
[1:43:46] there will be no more war
[1:43:52] praise the lord amen
[1:43:56] we have a city
[1:44:00] and that's the place that we have to be
[1:44:02] looking forward for
[1:44:05] because here there is no continuing city
[1:44:09] amen there is no continuing setting
[1:44:11] because
[1:44:12] it will it will pass away
[1:44:17] all of these places that are that have
[1:44:18] been burned down uh uh there was one
[1:44:21] right there on chicago the other there
[1:44:22] i i i i got there i mean they broke the
[1:44:25] whole thing down and
[1:44:26] and and and i mean when they broke it
[1:44:28] down i saw as i was passing by
[1:44:30] i tried to picture in my mind what
[1:44:34] what i knew it was
[1:44:37] they're going to wipe everything away
[1:44:38] they're going to build something there
[1:44:39] there is no continuing sitting that's
[1:44:41] just how the world will be
[1:44:44] praise the lord amen that's just how
[1:44:48] there is just no continuing city
[1:44:52] it's just going to be from one change to
[1:44:55] another change
[1:44:56] you and we have to know that is an
[1:44:59] element of time
[1:45:00] as long as we are in time there will
[1:45:03] always be
[1:45:04] changes
[1:45:08] that's one thing that time holds for us
[1:45:10] changes
[1:45:14] the bible says that the the heaven and
[1:45:17] the earth
[1:45:17] will pass away
[1:45:23] verb says it will be changed
[1:45:31] it goes through constant changing
[1:45:35] but no matter how they change it and no
[1:45:37] matter how they try to fix it better
[1:45:41] it will always need another
[1:45:47] keeping up or another change
[1:45:52] praise the lord if ariah don't take the
[1:45:56] city away
[1:45:59] a tornado will take it away if it is not
[1:46:02] a tornado a hurricane will take it away
[1:46:05] praise the lord i mean there are people
[1:46:07] there that is it texas that are going
[1:46:10] through a hurricane
[1:46:11] hurricane hanan they call it
[1:46:17] and that's the world that we caught that
[1:46:19] we are living in
[1:46:21] there will always be things happening
[1:46:24] especially around this time
[1:46:26] you know they were talking about uh you
[1:46:28] know uh eliminating the police you know
[1:46:30] what i
[1:46:30] thought about i can give you the call
[1:46:33] but bam says there will be a time where
[1:46:35] every house will pack a gun
[1:46:37] and if they ever try to do that that
[1:46:39] will come to pass
[1:46:52] that's the world that we are living in
[1:46:54] with all the changes and everything that
[1:46:56] is happening
[1:46:58] praise the lord but we have a city
[1:47:03] we have a city so you see why this few
[1:47:06] times i'm talking about the mountains
[1:47:08] and talking about
[1:47:09] your experiences you know what is the
[1:47:12] attraction
[1:47:12] on on your mountain i mean all the
[1:47:15] things that god been taking you
[1:47:17] through
[1:47:20] is now for increase in your salary
[1:47:26] it's not for the new house you're going
[1:47:27] to buy or the new car
[1:47:29] everything that god been taking you
[1:47:31] through is to prepare you for that
[1:47:34] setting
[1:47:37] it's for the city on the hill that we
[1:47:40] call
[1:47:41] mount zion amen
[1:47:46] praise the lord
[1:47:53] just like in the life of our father
[1:47:55] abraham god
[1:47:57] attracted him in different ways and god
[1:48:00] gave him different experiences and the
[1:48:03] more
[1:48:04] that abraham had one experience to
[1:48:06] another experience
[1:48:08] it increased his desire to look for that
[1:48:11] setting
[1:48:11] whose maker and bit and builder is god
[1:48:20] it's almost like if god can give me a
[1:48:23] child after 25 years
[1:48:25] what is it going to be if he can change
[1:48:28] my body
[1:48:29] what is it going to be in a city whose
[1:48:31] maker invader is god
[1:48:35] if god can give you a just
[1:48:38] an earnest of the inheritance you have a
[1:48:40] little peace of mind
[1:48:42] even though the devil comes here but you
[1:48:43] know where to carry your truth
[1:48:45] what is it going to be when you are
[1:48:47] completely free from stress
[1:48:53] the more you think about the city to
[1:48:55] come the more you appreciate the holy
[1:48:57] ghost
[1:48:59] the more you will appreciate what the
[1:49:01] holy ghost is
[1:49:04] if you don't have no desire for the
[1:49:05] sinner to come you don't even want the
[1:49:07] holy ghost
[1:49:08] because all your life is for this earth
[1:49:11] you live for this earth you die for this
[1:49:13] earth
[1:49:14] and you be condemned with this earth but
[1:49:17] there is a people
[1:49:19] who's looking for the city to come
[1:49:27] a city where they will study normal
[1:49:30] walls
[1:49:33] were there was steady no more wars
[1:49:40] my goodness did i pass my 25 minutes
[1:49:45] because it's just not a beginning to
[1:49:47] preach
[1:49:54] it's right now i'm starting to preach
[1:49:58] my goodness
[1:50:02] are we together
[1:50:05] but that's where we are going to that
[1:50:08] that
[1:50:09] that is the attraction that is the thing
[1:50:12] that god is attracting you to all
[1:50:14] it's not is not the pains of the
[1:50:17] suffering
[1:50:19] it's not the frustration of the trial
[1:50:21] but what he's attracting you to
[1:50:24] that there is a better land beyond the
[1:50:26] river
[1:50:27] that when all this is over
[1:50:31] you can sit at the banks of the river
[1:50:37] and say it worth it all
[1:50:43] you can sit at the banks of the river
[1:50:47] while other people waste their lives
[1:50:53] just to get in the right race of of of
[1:50:56] of
[1:50:56] a big house and uh and and and a better
[1:50:58] car and
[1:50:59] and and and when they realized then then
[1:51:02] you know then
[1:51:02] you know they have to pay for it anyway
[1:51:05] so they have to work more in
[1:51:07] and pay for it and put their life into
[1:51:10] all of that
[1:51:17] if god blesses us with that we
[1:51:20] appreciate it but it's not all we are
[1:51:21] putting our life
[1:51:22] into because we know that they are
[1:51:25] perishable
[1:51:29] there's a land beyond the river
[1:51:33] that is called the sweet forever
[1:51:37] there's a land beyond the river
[1:51:43] that is called the sweet forever have
[1:51:45] you ever thought about it
[1:51:49] to live can you imagine what
[1:51:54] noah was going through with the
[1:51:56] experience
[1:51:57] of being in the act
[1:52:02] free from trouble
[1:52:07] even the wave of the seed and the and
[1:52:10] the
[1:52:11] thunder it was just there to put them to
[1:52:14] sleep
[1:52:19] it was just enough to put them to sleep
[1:52:24] because if god can keep me
[1:52:29] in this lion then with the lion mob shot
[1:52:33] what more can he not do
[1:52:37] praise the lord what more can he not do
[1:52:41] you imagine how daniel came out
[1:52:45] how he came out of that lion then his
[1:52:48] life was
[1:52:48] not the same
[1:52:52] can you think about shadrach meshach and
[1:52:54] abednego
[1:52:55] having a confession that even if our god
[1:52:58] don't deliver us
[1:53:00] we are not going to burden but we know
[1:53:03] he's able to deliver us and for them to
[1:53:06] be in the fullness of fire
[1:53:08] not burn not burn
[1:53:13] for them to walk out
[1:53:19] oh you come and taste come and taste the
[1:53:23] lord
[1:53:24] and see that he's good
[1:53:28] you have not got a taste yet come and
[1:53:31] taste the lord
[1:53:32] and see that he's good when a man comes
[1:53:35] from
[1:53:36] out of those kind of atrials what more
[1:53:39] can you tell him
[1:53:42] what can you tell him about
[1:53:49] he don't have time to waste his time on
[1:53:51] lust and foolishness on the internet he
[1:53:53] don't have time because
[1:53:55] i mean it cooks you from the inside
[1:54:01] praise the lord daniel with all of his
[1:54:05] faith
[1:54:06] he's still there he prayed
[1:54:10] lord god of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:54:16] the god of our father noah you kept him
[1:54:20] in the ark lord
[1:54:22] father if this is my end
[1:54:26] i'll go and be with my fathers
[1:54:29] because sometimes those things
[1:54:32] the the the confession of faith
[1:54:36] comes from the soul you can't comprehend
[1:54:38] it
[1:54:39] it's not something that you comprehend
[1:54:41] and calculate
[1:54:43] oh when i get in there i would just be
[1:54:45] robbing the lion's head
[1:54:46] i'll be telling them you know lion you
[1:54:49] go yet you don't think about those
[1:54:51] things
[1:54:55] you don't think about those things like
[1:54:57] even those brothers they're in in the
[1:54:58] prison in in china
[1:55:02] you you can prepare your mind for that
[1:55:10] you can prepare your mind for that i
[1:55:12] remember one time you know
[1:55:13] going to a preach to some you know uh
[1:55:17] back home and we started you know just
[1:55:19] young street preachers and we're
[1:55:20] preaching to some
[1:55:21] some uh some soldiers rebels and uh you
[1:55:24] know right there
[1:55:25] we went and these guys know us you know
[1:55:28] but all this while we are visiting them
[1:55:30] they i mean they are military people
[1:55:32] this is a time of war
[1:55:34] and in their mind they are thinking
[1:55:38] this young men i did not own
[1:55:40] reconnaissance
[1:55:42] are they not finding a secret of this
[1:55:44] city so we went in
[1:55:46] and uh you know just there i'm i'm
[1:55:48] preaching and you know
[1:55:49] answering questions after everything
[1:55:53] listen gentlemen you identify yourself
[1:55:58] we took out our shoes before i know our
[1:56:01] shirts were off
[1:56:02] was sitting on the ground
[1:56:07] the whole thing changed all the laughter
[1:56:10] and joke
[1:56:10] and bible things were everything changed
[1:56:13] you can't prepare for those things
[1:56:16] you read those stories and you just
[1:56:17] think that daniel said his prayer
[1:56:20] all he knew that was that was a a
[1:56:24] a a praising for the most
[1:56:27] disobedient criminal they will throw you
[1:56:29] in there the lion will eat you that will
[1:56:31] be the end
[1:56:39] how the deliverance will come you don't
[1:56:41] calculate it in your mind
[1:56:45] this is not mind over matter
[1:56:51] he said his prayers he stepped in there
[1:56:55] when he go he go back a little bit
[1:56:58] oh my god lord
[1:57:02] oh jesus oh god
[1:57:06] and you're going like this
[1:57:10] and before he realized
[1:57:15] that then is shot
[1:57:19] only the sound will fear you the sound
[1:57:22] will run death from your head to your
[1:57:24] toes
[1:57:32] and he's sticking to the wall of the den
[1:57:38] thinking in his mind maybe they just ate
[1:57:40] that's why they are not rushing on me
[1:57:43] maybe they just have something to eat
[1:57:47] oh god commit myself in your hands
[1:57:50] praise the lord and then before he
[1:57:52] realized they were not even looking at
[1:57:54] him
[1:57:55] he said oh they are not looking at me oh
[1:57:58] thank you jesus
[1:58:03] then before it starts becoming real
[1:58:07] before it starts becoming real you
[1:58:09] remember when the angel took peter from
[1:58:11] out of prison
[1:58:12] he couldn't even believe it
[1:58:16] that he passed through those soldiers
[1:58:18] looking at them sleeping they get open
[1:58:20] oh
[1:58:20] wow he got outside he look at the prison
[1:58:23] really i'm outside
[1:58:28] you don't prepare it in your mind it's
[1:58:30] not premeditated
[1:58:34] but when you come from out of it there
[1:58:37] is a
[1:58:38] inner substance
[1:58:41] there is a inner substance that it
[1:58:44] builds
[1:58:46] oh i say coming see come and taste the
[1:58:49] lord
