========================================

[Music] so so [Music] do [Music] [Laughter] [Music] this ministry given them by our lord jesus and so when they died the ministry was over that is not so here in luke 10 1-9 we find that in the days of his earthly sojourn he had already started to give ministries of power to his own after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvest go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves carry neither purse nor script nor shoes and salute no man by the way and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the laborer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you who would dare deny the mighty ministry of philip who would dare to deny the mighty ministries of irenaeus martin columba patrick and countless scores of others who have had god's anointing upon them yes the bible way is the real way of the open door and i want to add my testimony to that the reason i have to do that is because i can only speak with assurance concerning what god has done in my own life so if you'll excuse a personal note here i will tell you how i know for a surety that jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever and that the power of god is still available to those who will believe and receive during my missionary trip to south africa god so blessed that when i came to durban the only place that could begin to accommodate the people was the huge race track which is the second largest in the world the crowd was well over one hundred thousand in order to keep law and order they had to put up fences to separate the various tribes they posted hundreds of policemen to keep the throngs quieted down those hungry souls had come for many miles a queen from rhodesia had come with a train of 27 coaches loaded with african natives they struggled in across the fields and mountains bearing on their backs for many and many a mile some loved one that needed help the whole country was stirred by the mighty works that had been manifested by the holy spirit one afternoon as i began to minister one of thousands of the mohammedans came up on the platform as she stood before me a missionary to the muhammadans began to softly implore the lord o for that precious soul oh for that precious soul he had been over there for years and years and according to his own testimony he had seen only one come to receive jesus christ as savior they were originally the medo persians whose laws change not they are so hard to win it seems that once a always a is a law amongst them well as she stood before me i began to speak to her and to all those thousands through the interpreters i said is it not so that the missionaries have told you of a jesus who came to save you you should have seen the people look at each other when i said that then when they had answered that was correct i went on and said but did the missionaries read to you out of this book i held my bible aloft for them to see that this same jesus was a mighty healer and that he would live in his people down through the ages until he came again to receive them unto himself did they tell you that because of that same spirit in them that was in jesus that they would be able to do mighty works even as jesus did did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved how many of you would like to see this same jesus come down amongst us and do the same things that he did when he was here on earth long ago they all wanted that that is one thing they surely agreed on i then went on if jesus by his spirit will do what he did when upon earth will you believe his word then [Music] and here was that muhammadan woman in front of me the spirit began to move through me i said to her now you know that i don't know you i can't even speak your language she admitted that i said as for healing you you know i cannot but you heard the message this afternoon and understood me her indian interpreter answered back for her that she understood for she had read the new testament now the muhammadans are descendants of abraham they believe in one god but they reject jesus as the son of god and instead they take muhammad as his prophet they say that jesus never died and rose again they are taught that by their priests and they believe it i said but jesus did die and rise again he sent his spirit back upon the church that spirit that was in him is the very same spirit in the church now and it can and will produce what jesus produced he said in john 5 19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now then if jesus will come and reveal to me what your trouble is or what you are here for if he can tell me what your past is surely you can believe for the future she said through her interpreter yes i can i said all right may he do it those muhammadans were watching intently they were all leaning forward to see what would happen then the holy spirit spoke your husband is a short heavyset man with a black mustache you have two children you were at the doctor's about three days ago and he gave you an examination you have a cyst on the womb she bowed her head and said that is true i asked her how is it you came to me a christian why didn't you go to your muhammadan prophet she said i think you can help me i said i can't help you but if you receive jesus christ as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he'll help you she said i accept jesus as my savior that did it she was healed and about ten thousand mohammedans came to christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power god never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he gave us the open door of word and power and that is what we are supposed to use that is what gave paul his great and effective ministry first corinthians 2 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power listen to me now it was while on this same trip that as i was boarding a plane at new salisbury rhodesia that i saw a party of four with american passports i went over to them and said hello there i see you have american passports are you traveling somewhere the young man answered me no we are all missionaries here how nice i replied are you on your own or do you work with some organization we are methodists we come from wilmore kentucky he said well that is almost in my backyard i replied you wouldn't be that brother branham that comes from up that way would you i said yes that's right that cured him he wouldn't say another thing and the way he and those three girls just looked back and forth at each other so i said just a minute son i'd like to speak to all of you about some principles seeing we are all christians and here for a great purpose now you say you have all four been here two years can you say in the name of jesus that you can put your finger on one soul that you know you have won to the lord they could not do it i don't want to hurt your feelings girls i said but you all ought to be home helping your mothers with the dishes you haven't any business out on the field unless you are filled with the holy ghost and preaching the true gospel in the demonstration of the power of the holy ghost if you are not seeing the results that jesus said you would see it's because you are not preaching the true gospel let me go a step further and show you just how things can be on the mission field i don't say it is all this way but i am afraid too much of it is it was while i was on this same trip and touring around durban with the mayor that i saw a native with a tag around his neck and he was packing an idol i asked my friend what that tag was for and he said that when a native embraced christianity they put a tag on him that sure surprised me for here was a man calling himself a christian and carrying that idol so i asked how that could be he said i can speak his language let us go over and talk to him so we went over and the mayor acted as my interpreter i asked the native if he was a christian he affirmed that he surely was a christian i then asked why he carried the idol if he was a christian he answered that it was an idol his father had carried and he left it to him when i told him that no christian ought to carry idols he replied that this idol had been of great use to his father i was curious to know how and he said that one day his father was being stalked by a lion so he built a fire and spoke to the idol the way he had been taught by the witch doctor the lion left i informed him that it was the fire that sent the lion off as fire scares all wild animals i will never forget his reply he said well it is this way if a moya the spirit fails then this idol won't a detailed account of the african campaign may be found in the book a prophet visits africa that is just about all the strength the christian multitudes have because the word was not brought to them by the original open door of pentecost now getting back to the open mission door of the philadelphian age it did not have the open door of power it ought to have had notice in the same verse he mentions this open door he says thou hast little strength that is right the power of the spirit was missing in that age the word was well preached it was well able to make souls wise unto salvation but the great power of god that showed forth his mighty works that made bear his arm in behalf of his own was missing except amongst the scattered groups yet praise god it was growing and had increased over what they had in the reformation it was in this age that the man we often call the father of missions went out william carey a village shoemaker who pastored the particular baptist church at molten england mightily aroused the people by preaching on whether the command given to the apostles to teach all nations was not obligatory on all succeeding ministers to the end of the world seeing that the accompanying promise was of equal extent he was fought by the calvinists who had gone to the extreme of the doctrine of election believing that all who will be saved will be saved and missionary work would be against the work of the spirit but andrew fuller helped mr kerry by his preaching and fundraising such was their effect that a society was formed to spread the gospel to all nations in 1792 this society sent out kerry who was signally blessed of god in winning souls in india in 1795 an aroused christianity formed the london missionary society which we well know raised millions of pounds and sent thousands of missionaries over the years to accomplish the desires of the lord the spirit of god was moving and other sheep might well have been the cry of the heart of those earnest believers i have set before thee an open door i want to look at these words again this time though i am not going to disassociate them from missions i am going to bring you a thought which carries deep into the last age as i have already stated this age melts into the last stage it was in this age jesus said i come quickly verse 11 and of the last age he was going to finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth romans 9 28 notice how this verse of revelation 3 8 goes open door little strength word name that open door has to do with all three now what does the door signify in john 10 7 it says then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep that is right i am is the door of the sheep now this is not just a quaint expression this is actually so notice in john 10 when jesus is giving this parable he calls himself the shepherd then he calls himself the door and that is what the shepherd is to the sheep he is actually their door when i was over in the east i saw that at night time the shepherd would gather all his sheep together he would put them into the fold then he would count them when he was sure that they were all in he would lie down in the open door of the fold and literally become the door to the fold no one could get in or out except by him he was the door the next day as i went riding with a friend in a jeep i noticed that a shepherd began to lead his flock into the city right away all traffic came to a stop so that the sheep could go through now the cities over in the east aren't like they are here we keep all our merchandise inside but there it is like a big farmer's market with all the produce on the pavement for passersby to see and buy i thought oh my here is where the riot begins wait till those sheep see all that food out there but as the shepherd went ahead those sheep just followed right along exactly in each step they would look at all those goodies but not a sheep touched a thing oh if i could only have known their language i would have stopped traffic myself and preached them a sermon on what i had just seen when you are sheep that belong to the great shepherd you follow right along in each of his steps just as those sheep did you won't be tempted to turn aside for some big flower of a church or listen to the voice of some dd or phd or lld but you will stay with the shepherd the bible says that the sheep know his voice and they follow him but a stranger's voice will only cause them to flee and run after their true shepherd praise god but that was not all i saw and learned over there one day i got to thinking about having seen men out in the fields hurting different kinds of animals one fellow would be tending some pigs another some goats another some camels another some mules etc so i asked a friend who lived there what they called those men oh he replied they are shepherds i couldn't take that i said you don't mean to say they are all shepherds shepherds only heard sheep don't they no he said a shepherd is a herder or grazer so anyone who grazes animals is a shepherd well that did surprise me but i noticed a difference between those herders and the ones that took care of the sheep come nighttime all the others but the shepherd of the sheep left his animals in the fields and went on home the shepherd took his sheep with him and put them into the fold and then lay down and became the door of the sheep oh praise god our shepherd never leaves us or forsakes us when night time comes i want to be in his fold i want to be in his care now then we can see that jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him and that revelation is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and glorify his name it was in the midst of the two last stages that the revelation of the deity of jesus christ blossomed out before us yes we knew he was god how else could he be our savior but to know that he was only god or god alone that he was the alpha and the omega that this jesus was both lord and christ making him lord jesus christ the father the son and holy ghost all one person that had been lost since the first church ages but now we are seeing it again the revelation of who he was had come back indeed godhead is not a three-person god with one personality for it takes personality to make a person if there is one personality there is but one person but they who believe in three persons have a three god godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment but the revelation of godhead is back now the true church can build in strength again after all this time she finally knows who her lord is once again we are baptizing in the name of the lord jesus just as they did at pentecost let me tell you of a god-given dream i had about triune baptism this was not a vision but a dream you know i am sure that one of the blessings of the church ages was to receive dreams by the holy ghost just the same as one can receive visions it was about 3am on a saturday morning i had just gotten up to get joseph a drink of water when i laid down i fell asleep instantly and dreamed this dream i saw a man that i supposed was my father he was a great big burly man i also saw a woman who was supposed to be my mother but she didn't look like her even as the man did not look like my father this man was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it you know when you take a log and set it up on end and hit it with an axe it makes a three-cornered wedge-like piece of firewood it was like that he would take this club and hit her with it and knock her down as she would lie there crying he would walk around with his chest stuck out and on his face was such a proud boastful look but he appeared to take great pride and satisfaction in beating up a poor little woman every time she tried to get up he would hit her i did not like what he was doing but as i considered stopping him i thought i can't tackle that man he is too big then he's supposed to be my father but down inside i knew he wasn't my father and i knew that no man had the right to treat a woman like that i went over and grabbed him by the collar and turned him around and said you have no right to strike her and when i said that my muscles grew and i looked like a giant the man saw them and then he was scared of me i said you strike her again and you'll deal with me he hesitated to strike her again and then the dream left me i awoke immediately after the dream i thought how strange that was i wondered why i had dreamed about that woman when suddenly there he came and the presence of god became known to me and the interpretation of the dream came from him now you people know that not only have i interpreted your dreams exactly but i have many many times told you what you dreamed so that you never had to tell me the woman represents the church of the world today i was born right into this mess the mess that she is in she was supposed to be a kind of mother she is the mother of harlots her husband is the denominations that rule her the three cornered block is false triune baptism onto a trinity every time she started to rise up that means the congregations began to accept truth he would drive her right down again with that false doctrine he was so big that i was afraid of him at first but when i came against him i found i had great and powerful muscles they were faith muscles the outcome of the dream was that since god is with me and can give me such strength then let me stand up for her against the denominational power of the world and make him quit striking her now i am not trying to build a doctrine upon a dream nor am i trying to vindicate any doctrine i stand for by a dream oneness of the godhead is all the way from genesis 1 1 to revelation 22 21 but the people have been blinded by an unscriptural dogma of a trinity and that dogma is so universally accepted that to try to see a one god person is all but impossible if people can't see the truth of the godhead but fight it they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the revelation is jesus christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for the seven ages did you get that now i am sure you understand thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and not denied my name now we have already mentioned how the strength was returning it was the power of the inquisition had waned people had left their homelands and demanded a freedom of worship the yoke of the hierarchy was being broken the governments were finding it wise not to champion one segment against another in fact well-meaning but poorly led people were willing to wage war to defend their religious rights perhaps the greatest show of strength of religion in this age was the fact that though france fell in revolution the great wesleyan revival kept the revolution away from great britain and saved her to be an instrument in the hand of god for many glorious years the preaching of the word was never greater as satan raised up his hordes of free thinkers as the originators of communism rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy wares god raised up mighty warriors of faith and the greatest works of christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be the spurgeons parkers mclarens the edwards bunions muellers brainerds barns bishops all came from this era they preached taught and wrote the word they glorified his name the judgment of the false jew revelation 3 9 behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee now we can note immediately that this problem of the false jew or false believers was already in existence in the second age these who falsely called themselves jews appeared right after the first outpouring of the first age and now they appear again in the second age after the reformation this is hardly an accident indeed it is not an accident it is a principle of satan that principle is to organize and claim originality and therefore be entitled to special rights and privileges let me show you back there in the smyrnan age these people lied and said they were actually jews or believers when they definitely were not they were of the synagogue of satan they were satan's organized crowd for it wasn't that age we saw the start of men in the ministry taking an unwarranted leadership over their ministering brethren bishops set up in districts over elders the next thing we saw was that in the third age there was definitely a place called satan's seat that age gave us church and state marriage with the power of the state behind her the church was literally physically invincible but god broke that hold in spite of the power of the state and the reformation brought great light but what happened the lutherans organized and joined with the state and again we see the synagogue of satan manifested in this sixth age now of course this synagogue group wouldn't say they are of satan no sir they say they are of god but they lie for he that is a true jew that is what they claim to be is one who is a jew inwardly in the spirit so then if they are false jews it means that they are as jude 19 says having not the spirit children of god are born of the spirit these have not the spirit and therefore they are not children of god no matter how fervently they protest and to what lengths they go to try to prove that they are they are dead they are children of organization and the true fruits are missing they are built upon their own creeds dogmas and doctrines and the truth is not in them for they have taken their own counsels above the word of god [Music] you
