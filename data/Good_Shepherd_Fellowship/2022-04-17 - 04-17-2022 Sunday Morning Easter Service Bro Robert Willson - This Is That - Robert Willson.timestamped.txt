[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:37] said
[1:07:43] is
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:07:56] and i saw in the right hand of him
[1:08:00] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:08:03] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:08:06] seven seals
[1:08:08] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:08:11] with a loud voice
[1:08:13] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:08:15] loose the seals thereof
[1:08:18] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[1:08:20] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:08:23] the book
[1:08:24] neither to look there on
[1:08:27] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:08:30] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:08:33] neither to look there wrong
[1:08:35] and one of the elders said unto me weak
[1:08:38] not
[1:08:39] behold
[1:08:41] the line of the tribe of judah
[1:08:43] the rule of david has prevailed to open
[1:08:47] the book
[1:08:48] and to loose the seven shields thereof
[1:08:52] and i be held in low in the midst of the
[1:08:54] throne
[1:08:55] and of the four beasts
[1:08:57] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[1:08:59] lamb
[1:09:00] as it had been slain
[1:09:02] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:09:06] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[1:09:09] into all the earth
[1:09:11] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:09:14] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:09:16] throne
[1:09:17] and when he had taken the book
[1:09:19] the four beasts and four and twenty
[1:09:21] elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:09:23] every one of them harps and golden vows
[1:09:26] full of adores which are the prayers of
[1:09:28] the saints
[1:09:35] is
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:52] me
[1:10:01] [Music]
[1:10:09] jesus
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:10:20] is
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:34] is
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:43] [Applause]
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:11:00] grace
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:13] the preacher comes
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:20] yes jesus
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:49] wilson
[1:11:51] [Applause]
[1:11:52] [Music]
[1:12:02] and god bless you all
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:06] while we we are standing we'll go
[1:12:08] straight to the scriptures
[1:12:10] it's an honor for me to be here to
[1:12:13] fellowship with you and
[1:12:16] trust in yielding that the holy ghost
[1:12:18] will come and minister to you personally
[1:12:21] that's why i'm here i'm not here to tell
[1:12:23] you what i feel what i think
[1:12:26] but what god thinks of you
[1:12:29] and
[1:12:30] though most of you don't know me i don't
[1:12:32] know most of you some were here
[1:12:34] yesterday so we fellowshipped a little
[1:12:35] bit
[1:12:38] on the death of a testator
[1:12:42] you know
[1:12:43] as paul said
[1:12:44] when somebody makes a world
[1:12:46] the world only comes into force after
[1:12:48] the death of the person that made the
[1:12:51] world
[1:12:55] the mistake we make in these days is
[1:12:57] that
[1:12:58] we are not conscious of the world
[1:13:01] that the father has made
[1:13:03] so we still see jesus christ hanging on
[1:13:05] the cross
[1:13:08] but the death actually
[1:13:10] has now put every promise god made into
[1:13:13] force
[1:13:16] never in other age because if we fail in
[1:13:19] this age god has failed
[1:13:22] if this is all that we are doing then
[1:13:25] what is god doing his devil having the
[1:13:26] upper hand oh god is having the upper
[1:13:28] hand so let's get beyond the cross
[1:13:31] and see what god promised us
[1:13:34] i didn't have time yesterday to go
[1:13:35] through the promises
[1:13:37] but
[1:13:41] if you ever get time i'm sure pastor
[1:13:43] will pick it up
[1:13:46] you look at your inheritance
[1:13:49] inheritance is not something you work
[1:13:51] for i'm trying to bring it because some
[1:13:53] of you were not here yesterday
[1:13:54] inheritance is what somebody
[1:13:57] thought about you
[1:13:58] and put your name in the world
[1:14:01] so you don't even have a choice of what
[1:14:03] you got
[1:14:06] i'm i i i told you yesterday if
[1:14:10] i inherit a dog maybe
[1:14:12] i might eat it so i might not get a dog
[1:14:16] but somebody might get a dog somebody
[1:14:17] might get a car somebody might get a car
[1:14:19] but he knows what you can handle
[1:14:23] and when you think about those things
[1:14:26] it brings you into perspective that
[1:14:28] the one who made you
[1:14:30] made you special
[1:14:32] so he can give you something you can
[1:14:34] handle
[1:14:36] and the greatest
[1:14:37] inheritance is eternal life there's only
[1:14:40] one eternal life that's god's
[1:14:43] life
[1:14:46] we are inheriting
[1:14:49] immortality do you know what it means
[1:14:52] no more death
[1:14:54] it's an inheritance
[1:14:56] so death
[1:14:58] is kicked as far away as possible
[1:15:02] so when you look at that then you see
[1:15:04] that
[1:15:05] easter means
[1:15:07] the world has been read
[1:15:09] your name is in there
[1:15:12] and god's word is being enforced
[1:15:15] in your life
[1:15:17] so your victory is sealed unless jesus
[1:15:20] christ didn't die if he died then
[1:15:23] either it's enforced or it's not in
[1:15:25] force
[1:15:27] and it's not like your relative that
[1:15:28] will come back and say well robert is
[1:15:30] not behaving well so every inheritance
[1:15:33] i'm getting it back
[1:15:36] god is not an indian giver
[1:15:38] so when he gives you something it
[1:15:40] doesn't matter what you do
[1:15:42] it's forever
[1:15:44] so resurrection should mean to us that
[1:15:46] we are not here to play church come read
[1:15:49] a quote listen to brother abraham listen
[1:15:51] to a preaching but we come here so that
[1:15:54] the executor yesterday we talked about
[1:15:56] it
[1:15:57] like the prophet is reminding us that
[1:16:00] you have an inheritance
[1:16:02] walk like somebody who is rich
[1:16:05] walk like somebody who is healed
[1:16:08] walk like somebody who has eternal life
[1:16:13] so those days of groomy days of thinking
[1:16:15] about oh am i going to make it oh is it
[1:16:17] better
[1:16:18] they their past because
[1:16:20] it's not me enforcing it god is
[1:16:22] enforcing it
[1:16:23] and that's why he sent the holy ghost
[1:16:26] so i want to this morning to encourage
[1:16:28] you that
[1:16:30] we are not furious
[1:16:32] we have already overcome
[1:16:37] the die is cast the devil has lost
[1:16:40] and
[1:16:42] when you have that and you are walking
[1:16:44] around it gives you
[1:16:46] a victory that you've never experienced
[1:16:49] so this one we want to follow the same
[1:16:51] thoughts
[1:16:52] at a much higher level
[1:16:55] and
[1:16:56] i'm going to use some slides to try to
[1:16:58] capture your mind
[1:17:01] we have to walk out of here
[1:17:03] with something amen it shouldn't be like
[1:17:06] we came to church last week yesterday
[1:17:08] this should be a different church just
[1:17:09] because
[1:17:10] we might not have this again
[1:17:14] the world is gone the time is up
[1:17:17] so if this is the last time we are
[1:17:19] getting together
[1:17:21] then i believe god will
[1:17:23] make us be sure of our work
[1:17:26] so we want to use
[1:17:27] acts chapter 2
[1:17:30] verse 16
[1:17:32] and if you have your bibles you can also
[1:17:33] turn to joel
[1:17:35] chapter 2 28
[1:17:37] and then we'll pray and we'll just be
[1:17:40] seated
[1:17:41] thank you again we have a little
[1:17:43] assembly in chicago
[1:17:45] and brother wong has been a great friend
[1:17:48] we talk on the phone we do so many
[1:17:49] things but
[1:17:51] god impressed on him to
[1:17:53] let us come and spend the weekend with
[1:17:55] you and we trust that will be a blessing
[1:17:57] to you
[1:17:58] also
[1:17:59] so i'll read acts chapter 2 16 and then
[1:18:02] george chapter 2 28. if you don't have
[1:18:05] your bible you can always look on the on
[1:18:07] the screen it's always good to
[1:18:10] have your bible
[1:18:11] with you
[1:18:12] so i'm getting to joel and then we'll
[1:18:14] read it
[1:18:15] so
[1:18:16] let's hear the word of the lord
[1:18:20] acts 2 16.
[1:18:22] probably let me give you a little bit of
[1:18:24] background
[1:18:26] verse 1 of acts chapter 2 says and when
[1:18:28] the day of pentecost was fully come they
[1:18:30] were all with one accord in one place
[1:18:32] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:18:34] heaven as of a russian mighty wind and
[1:18:36] it filled all the house where they were
[1:18:40] sitting
[1:18:41] and there appeared unto them clothing
[1:18:43] tongues like ass of fire and he sat upon
[1:18:45] each of them verse 4 says and they were
[1:18:48] all filled with the holy ghost
[1:18:51] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:18:53] the spirit gave them utterance
[1:18:56] and there were dwelling
[1:18:57] at jerusalem jews devout men out of
[1:19:00] every nation under heaven
[1:19:01] when this was noised abroad the
[1:19:04] multitude came together and were
[1:19:05] confounded because that every man had
[1:19:08] them speak in his own language and they
[1:19:11] were all amazed and marveled saying one
[1:19:13] to another behold
[1:19:15] are these not are not all these god
[1:19:18] these we speak galileans
[1:19:20] and how hear every man our own tongue
[1:19:23] wearing we're born
[1:19:25] now jump to
[1:19:27] verse 14
[1:19:29] but 13 says other smoking said these men
[1:19:32] are full of new wine so verse 14 says
[1:19:35] but peter standing up with the eleven
[1:19:38] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[1:19:40] ye men of judea and all ye that dwell at
[1:19:43] jerusalem be this known unto you
[1:19:46] and hacking to my voice
[1:19:48] for these are not drunken as he supposed
[1:19:51] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[1:19:54] day
[1:19:54] and verse 16
[1:19:56] that's where we base our thought
[1:19:58] but this is that which was spoken by the
[1:20:01] prophet joel
[1:20:03] so if you turn to joel 2 28
[1:20:06] this is the scripture peter was quoting
[1:20:10] and it shall come to pass afterward that
[1:20:12] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:20:16] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:20:17] prophesy
[1:20:19] your old men shall dream dreams and your
[1:20:21] young men shall see visions
[1:20:23] and up and also upon the servants and
[1:20:25] upon the handmaids in those days will i
[1:20:28] pour out my spirit
[1:20:31] lord jesus
[1:20:33] the holy ghost is your program
[1:20:37] and no man
[1:20:38] can't say anything but by your spirit
[1:20:41] no man can hear your voice but by your
[1:20:44] spirit
[1:20:45] no man can do anything except your
[1:20:47] spirit quickens them
[1:20:49] we are waiting for a quick clean this
[1:20:50] morning quicken our flesh
[1:20:54] we reject every sickness everything that
[1:20:56] we feel in our physical body
[1:20:59] may your spirit
[1:21:01] not only hover over us but come inside
[1:21:05] and open our minds open our thoughts
[1:21:08] that we can understand what
[1:21:10] today means to you and to us in your
[1:21:14] name we pray amen please be seated i
[1:21:17] will try not to keep you too long
[1:21:21] yesterday i apologize i kept too long
[1:21:24] but
[1:21:25] i
[1:21:26] realized people were into what was going
[1:21:29] on so
[1:21:31] this one we all can remember right this
[1:21:33] is that
[1:21:36] sometimes we get a thought and the
[1:21:38] thought is so complicated
[1:21:40] and you don't remember
[1:21:42] so how many will try and remember this
[1:21:44] is that
[1:21:45] so when somebody tells you this is that
[1:21:48] they are pointing to something
[1:21:52] our life
[1:21:54] sometimes
[1:21:55] people get confused on who we are
[1:21:58] somebody meets us and says
[1:22:00] who are you really oh i am the person
[1:22:03] so this is that it's like a pointer
[1:22:07] to a fact
[1:22:08] a pointer to what is happening
[1:22:11] so on the day of pentecost
[1:22:14] there has been promises in the bible
[1:22:16] but there's one promise in jewel that
[1:22:19] god said i'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:22:21] all flesh
[1:22:24] so when the day of pentecost came
[1:22:27] some people were sure some people were
[1:22:29] not sure so as we read some people
[1:22:31] thought they were even drunk
[1:22:35] one thing i find is that god is always
[1:22:38] obligated
[1:22:39] that's what god does
[1:22:41] to come and point to what he is doing
[1:22:45] if god doesn't point to you what he's
[1:22:47] doing you're going to miss it
[1:22:49] so i can go through all the bible and
[1:22:51] show you
[1:22:52] that he has to come and point to you
[1:22:55] and we have abraham says
[1:22:57] god is his own interpreter
[1:23:00] he has to interpret it and tell you what
[1:23:02] he's doing
[1:23:04] because this is the time that sometimes
[1:23:06] we want to know what god is doing so
[1:23:08] i'll go to facebook
[1:23:10] i'll go to youtube hear my favorite
[1:23:12] pastor
[1:23:13] uh hear the news
[1:23:15] cnn
[1:23:16] there's confusion everywhere
[1:23:20] but god has to come and point to you
[1:23:22] that this is that or this is what he is
[1:23:25] doing
[1:23:26] if he doesn't point to you you can even
[1:23:29] listen to a message every day and you
[1:23:30] still don't know what god is doing
[1:23:35] the time of abraham that the seals were
[1:23:37] open and all that that's over 60 years
[1:23:39] now
[1:23:43] now
[1:23:45] as the croc stopped
[1:23:47] the clock is moving on
[1:23:49] where are we today
[1:23:51] and so sometimes we are caught up in the
[1:23:53] history
[1:23:54] because man is always praising god for
[1:23:56] what god did yesterday
[1:23:59] what he's going to do in the future and
[1:24:02] we miss what he's doing now
[1:24:04] so god comes and says this is what i am
[1:24:07] doing now
[1:24:09] this is it
[1:24:12] because we have a vision of what god is
[1:24:14] going to do and many times is miles and
[1:24:17] miles away
[1:24:19] so the disciples if you read the bible
[1:24:21] one day they came to him and they said
[1:24:24] we believe john the baptist must come
[1:24:27] and he said
[1:24:28] he has come already
[1:24:30] and you missed it
[1:24:33] this is the last age from here we become
[1:24:36] immortals
[1:24:38] so if we miss it that would be a great
[1:24:40] miss
[1:24:43] that's why we have to be current with
[1:24:45] god
[1:24:46] we have to ask god lord what is it today
[1:24:50] for me
[1:24:51] so on the day of pentecost
[1:24:53] all these
[1:24:55] people about 3 000 people everybody was
[1:24:58] wondering what is god doing now
[1:25:01] it's like us
[1:25:03] the seals have been opened what is god
[1:25:04] doing now
[1:25:06] i go to church what is god doing now i
[1:25:09] got a nice quote i can send to another
[1:25:11] brother about what god is doing now
[1:25:14] and because we are caught up in the warp
[1:25:17] of
[1:25:18] history
[1:25:19] oh this is easter
[1:25:21] christ is on the cross that's wonderful
[1:25:26] it's good thought
[1:25:29] and if you really want to be dramatic
[1:25:30] about it we can buy a cross
[1:25:33] probably with the similar wood that
[1:25:34] jesus and with some blood on it and i
[1:25:37] can get one of you to carry it and will
[1:25:39] crucify you on the cross
[1:25:42] it's happening you go to philippines
[1:25:44] that's what they do every time
[1:25:47] so
[1:25:49] man is so confused
[1:25:51] that what god is doing i'm talking about
[1:25:53] in a message i'm talking about christian
[1:25:55] though
[1:25:56] what god is doing we miss a thousand
[1:25:58] times because we are all looking at
[1:26:00] something else
[1:26:02] and so this morning i want to post you a
[1:26:04] little bit on what god is doing
[1:26:08] so when god says anything
[1:26:12] he
[1:26:13] vindicates it
[1:26:15] and that is interpretation of it
[1:26:18] he said he will pour out his spirit
[1:26:21] in the last days
[1:26:23] did he do it yes
[1:26:26] are you sure
[1:26:29] do you have a spirit
[1:26:33] because when god promised it he does it
[1:26:37] and sometimes we are in a hurry so okay
[1:26:40] if i didn't get it let's go to the next
[1:26:41] thing god doesn't work that way because
[1:26:43] it's a building block
[1:26:45] because without his spirit the bible
[1:26:46] says you are even none of his
[1:26:50] so this is the time that the death of
[1:26:52] jesus christ is enforcing
[1:26:56] because as we said a world comes into
[1:26:58] effect after the death of the person who
[1:27:01] made the world
[1:27:02] you can't go and say my dad made the
[1:27:04] world to give me a house he's not dead
[1:27:06] but i'm taking over the house
[1:27:09] you can pray for him to die quickly
[1:27:12] which is all right
[1:27:14] so you can take over the house
[1:27:16] but until he's gone
[1:27:18] by law you can't own it
[1:27:21] but when he's dead and gone
[1:27:23] the only thing you have to be sure is
[1:27:24] that your name is in it
[1:27:26] and that's the hardest part and then
[1:27:28] when your name is is in it did i get a
[1:27:30] house or a dog or something else and
[1:27:33] then you envy somebody who had something
[1:27:35] that you really wanted but that was
[1:27:37] yesterday today we want to bring you to
[1:27:39] a point where you see that
[1:27:41] this promise is unto
[1:27:44] you and christ died on easter
[1:27:48] so god can release his spirit for you
[1:27:52] amen
[1:27:54] do you get it
[1:27:56] if you don't get this issa doesn't mean
[1:27:58] much to you
[1:28:01] but when you get it that
[1:28:03] god took christ to calvary
[1:28:06] so that all that was in christ
[1:28:09] can be poured onto you
[1:28:12] those were the days
[1:28:15] peter's time when he read this
[1:28:17] but we've come through generations till
[1:28:19] this is the last day
[1:28:21] any moment from now this is not a time
[1:28:23] to even look for gifts this is the time
[1:28:25] to look for the spirit that will quicken
[1:28:28] you quicken your mortal bodies
[1:28:31] so you go in a rapture
[1:28:36] i wish i had power or there's a way i
[1:28:39] will make sure everybody here have that
[1:28:41] holy ghost
[1:28:43] it's god that gives it
[1:28:45] and i want to let you know
[1:28:47] you get a car you get money
[1:28:50] you always need more but when you get
[1:28:52] the holy ghost
[1:28:54] you got it all
[1:28:57] i wish i have the voice of an archangel
[1:28:59] or something to tell you that
[1:29:02] you know if you don't have to test for
[1:29:03] it
[1:29:04] it's you that have to go to god and say
[1:29:06] god
[1:29:09] this is the spirit
[1:29:10] that i need
[1:29:12] this is what i need to be able to live
[1:29:14] for god
[1:29:15] this is what i need to be able to stand
[1:29:18] this is what i need to be able to read
[1:29:20] the bible this is what i need
[1:29:23] and it's not that now you're going to
[1:29:25] plead but his death means god himself
[1:29:28] confirms
[1:29:30] by an oath
[1:29:32] as a testator
[1:29:33] that i
[1:29:36] have promised you you just have to
[1:29:39] open up and say lord
[1:29:41] may i receive that
[1:29:43] so he doesn't need anyone to interpret
[1:29:45] him he does his
[1:29:50] interpretation if you read through the
[1:29:52] bible
[1:29:54] one of the things that
[1:29:55] as i said god always confirms
[1:29:59] one time in the book of exodus people
[1:30:01] were
[1:30:02] being led to the promised land
[1:30:05] they were hungry
[1:30:06] and god told moses
[1:30:08] i'm going to feed them
[1:30:12] and they were wondering over 2 million
[1:30:14] people about 2 million people how is god
[1:30:16] going to feed us
[1:30:19] is he going to open a chinese buffet or
[1:30:23] what is god going to do
[1:30:25] the people were looking at
[1:30:27] moses and they thought
[1:30:29] moses would believe you
[1:30:31] but where are the ovens that are even
[1:30:33] going to bake the bread
[1:30:35] where is the farm that will
[1:30:37] farm the wheat
[1:30:39] it didn't look possible
[1:30:42] till one morning they wake up and
[1:30:45] something was falling from the skies
[1:30:49] and we were wondering what is this
[1:30:53] bats were falling dead on the side of
[1:30:55] the road
[1:30:56] what is this
[1:30:57] so if you turn to exodus 1623
[1:31:01] and moses said unto them
[1:31:04] this is that
[1:31:08] which the lord had said
[1:31:10] that tomorrow is the rest of the holy
[1:31:13] rest of the holy s
[1:31:16] said bake that which you bake today see
[1:31:17] that which you see today and lay over
[1:31:20] what you mean it but this is that that
[1:31:22] god promised that he will bring you food
[1:31:27] so god doesn't need your help that's why
[1:31:30] in this age all things are possible
[1:31:34] can we all say it
[1:31:36] all things are possible
[1:31:39] there's no limitation in this age
[1:31:42] in other ages you know
[1:31:45] they were all waiting for this age
[1:31:48] this is the age
[1:31:50] all things are possible
[1:31:53] so when you walk on you pray don't limit
[1:31:56] it that
[1:31:57] i'm praying for this and i might need
[1:31:59] the money
[1:32:01] god is able to open
[1:32:03] the skies and bring food
[1:32:05] so it was such a miracle to the people
[1:32:08] walking to the promised land
[1:32:09] and we are going on a promised land
[1:32:13] so now
[1:32:15] when moses told them this is the manner
[1:32:18] the people were wondering
[1:32:20] are you really sure
[1:32:23] so they started collecting
[1:32:25] the manner
[1:32:28] they ate it
[1:32:30] it was good
[1:32:32] they adquail they complained for meat
[1:32:34] god gave them meat
[1:32:37] so the whole two million people they
[1:32:40] didn't need a walmart they didn't need a
[1:32:41] buffet god every morning
[1:32:45] send them food
[1:32:49] he fed them but if moses didn't point it
[1:32:52] to them they would have stramped on it
[1:32:53] and say oh this can be good food but the
[1:32:56] bible says they at all
[1:32:59] throughout
[1:33:01] the 38 years or so until they got to the
[1:33:04] promised land
[1:33:06] every day and it was not that you go one
[1:33:09] day and and and collect it here
[1:33:12] they moved to another spot
[1:33:14] the next morning there was mana
[1:33:17] they moved to
[1:33:18] kurdish bania there was manner
[1:33:22] food was provided along the way
[1:33:27] but moses had to point to them that this
[1:33:29] is that they woke up in the morning they
[1:33:31] never planted they never did anything
[1:33:33] there was food
[1:33:36] they wake up in the morning
[1:33:38] let's take our tent probably some were
[1:33:40] worried that maybe we have to go back to
[1:33:42] that valley and there will be food there
[1:33:43] no the food is where you are
[1:33:47] god is obligated to bring you food where
[1:33:49] you are
[1:33:51] but when moses pointed it to them they
[1:33:54] knew it
[1:33:55] that this is the promise that god made
[1:33:57] and he has fulfilled it
[1:33:59] then he told them you know take what you
[1:34:01] can eat
[1:34:02] don't take more and store it but you
[1:34:05] know me i'll take a little bit because i
[1:34:07] might wake up in the middle of the night
[1:34:09] and try to eat some more
[1:34:11] you wake up you go and it's all muggled
[1:34:17] but moses had to point to them that this
[1:34:19] is that
[1:34:20] i want to point to you this morning
[1:34:23] this is that holy ghost
[1:34:25] that was in christ
[1:34:27] that has been released on easter morning
[1:34:29] to us
[1:34:32] this is that that is going to lead us to
[1:34:35] the promised land
[1:34:36] this is that that has come to enforce
[1:34:39] the will of the father in our lives
[1:34:42] this is that that gives us victory over
[1:34:44] our sins this is god that will give us
[1:34:48] make us overcome everything that we face
[1:34:52] you can't leave the holy ghost out
[1:34:58] maybe we might say the holy ghost is on
[1:35:00] the tapes that's okay
[1:35:02] but you see
[1:35:04] the holy ghost is alive
[1:35:06] that you have to live
[1:35:11] so god all through the ages
[1:35:14] promises something
[1:35:17] he delivers it
[1:35:18] and then he points it to those
[1:35:21] who were ordained
[1:35:23] to be part of it
[1:35:25] i'll repeat that
[1:35:27] god makes a promise
[1:35:29] the promise sounds general
[1:35:32] but he being god for ordains people
[1:35:36] to be on earth at that time to receive
[1:35:38] that promise
[1:35:40] because the promise is not for everybody
[1:35:43] let's be honest
[1:35:44] some people will never see it
[1:35:47] some people that's what they've been
[1:35:49] waiting for
[1:35:50] now i'll go back to his popular story
[1:35:53] the woman at the world
[1:35:54] who is she
[1:35:56] somebody that can't even mix with people
[1:35:59] she goes to fetch water
[1:36:02] and here he meets a man that didn't look
[1:36:05] like a priest or a pastor
[1:36:08] and he says give me a drink
[1:36:11] okay
[1:36:12] i'm not sure whether you want to ask a
[1:36:14] drink from me she gives him a drink oh
[1:36:17] then they started talking
[1:36:19] and he said you've had five husbands my
[1:36:22] but because she was ordained
[1:36:27] she said
[1:36:30] you must be a prophet
[1:36:32] because when we know a prophet comes
[1:36:34] he's going to do these things
[1:36:36] and then he just
[1:36:38] used a different word
[1:36:40] instead of saying this is that prophet
[1:36:42] he said i am he amen
[1:36:46] the woman forgot that women should not
[1:36:49] preach
[1:36:50] she left her water pot
[1:36:54] and went to samaria
[1:36:56] and preached the whole town
[1:36:58] so when philip went the foundation had
[1:37:00] already been laid
[1:37:02] there was a great revival
[1:37:04] when god points to you that this is that
[1:37:07] it makes a big difference
[1:37:09] i mean your prayer is different
[1:37:12] your life is
[1:37:14] different because the devil can't come
[1:37:16] to it because god personally points to
[1:37:18] you that this is that
[1:37:21] god has to point to you that this is
[1:37:23] that husband i promised you
[1:37:26] this is that wife i promise you
[1:37:28] this is that church that i want you to
[1:37:31] be many times we go from pillar to post
[1:37:34] trying to go to any church because i
[1:37:36] like this pastor and i don't like that
[1:37:38] but god has to show you where to be
[1:37:43] i mean why will god have to send
[1:37:44] brethren to tucson so he can open the
[1:37:47] seals to them
[1:37:50] and he always said you know
[1:37:53] the west seems to be a good place
[1:37:55] but he had to be in jeff
[1:37:57] but when the seals were open he had to
[1:37:58] go there
[1:38:00] so god has
[1:38:01] a tie
[1:38:03] to his word to his people
[1:38:06] and i want you to know that
[1:38:08] god for ordained you to be here today
[1:38:12] in this church today
[1:38:14] because he had prepared manner for you
[1:38:17] not me i have no idea what you need i
[1:38:19] have no idea that you'll be here i had
[1:38:21] no idea
[1:38:23] but he has planned something for you
[1:38:26] this morning
[1:38:27] and so when our years are tuned to it
[1:38:30] lord what do you have for me
[1:38:32] what do you have for me
[1:38:33] and i'm confident that just like he
[1:38:35] provided manner it's all in the bible
[1:38:38] all the years that they were working
[1:38:40] walking they never lacked food
[1:38:43] i mean look at god he could tell elijah
[1:38:46] that i have commanded ravens to feed you
[1:38:52] i i never could understand it
[1:38:55] there is human beings on earth but the
[1:38:57] god told elijah i've commanded residents
[1:38:59] to feed you
[1:39:00] just go and sit by the brook
[1:39:03] maybe nine o'clock
[1:39:05] cow cow cow cow
[1:39:07] they leave the food
[1:39:09] like
[1:39:10] breakfast is ready elijah will go and
[1:39:12] pick it
[1:39:13] but remember god had to tell elijah that
[1:39:15] the ravens are coming so look for it
[1:39:19] so elijah will go and eat his food
[1:39:21] in my mind i imagine
[1:39:24] god knows what somebody is cooking
[1:39:27] he wait for the and he knows what elijah
[1:39:29] likes
[1:39:31] after you've done the hamburger or
[1:39:33] whatever with the nice uh i don't know
[1:39:35] mustard or
[1:39:38] leaves
[1:39:39] oh let me go collect the plate
[1:39:42] a raving just sweeps moves down
[1:39:44] just picks it
[1:39:46] the food you prepared is not for you
[1:39:47] it's for elijah
[1:39:49] that is the god we are working with
[1:39:56] the bible says two meals a day
[1:39:59] if i can just eat and sleep i will be
[1:40:02] nervous
[1:40:03] am i going to have dinner tonight
[1:40:05] don't worry about it 4 p.m
[1:40:09] the raven swoops down
[1:40:11] what did i get today it's not your worry
[1:40:15] god knows what you are craving for
[1:40:17] so today he doesn't go to that lady
[1:40:19] because he's too much into
[1:40:21] rice today i'm going to give you some
[1:40:23] potatoes
[1:40:25] and elijah heads and children were dying
[1:40:29] the whole nation people were dying
[1:40:31] elijah was eating
[1:40:34] that's what we are talking about
[1:40:36] we read these stories and it becomes
[1:40:38] like
[1:40:39] did it really happen see it's by faith
[1:40:42] so god knows what we need today
[1:40:45] he can command ravens to bring you
[1:40:48] something
[1:40:51] i look at it i said is this the same god
[1:40:57] if he could do that what can he do
[1:41:00] in your life
[1:41:02] healing what do you need
[1:41:05] it's our faith i have to accept that
[1:41:07] this is that this is the last time that
[1:41:11] god has released all his power on it
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:17] oh elijah was growing fat he needed some
[1:41:19] exercise machines or something but he
[1:41:21] just wakes up and eats
[1:41:24] two meals a day
[1:41:26] and you couldn't even eat one meal
[1:41:31] and when all of that finished he said oh
[1:41:33] i've commanded another lady to uh i
[1:41:36] widow to feed you you know just take a
[1:41:38] couple of walk down the street and you
[1:41:40] meet the widow
[1:41:42] it doesn't matter whether there's
[1:41:44] food in the house or what
[1:41:47] how god is able to provide
[1:41:50] from nothing
[1:41:54] if elijah walked without god
[1:41:58] and
[1:41:59] that is those days
[1:42:01] but this is the age where god has
[1:42:03] released everything
[1:42:05] you can do a better work with him like
[1:42:07] elijah did
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:14] job 42 5 job said i've heard of thee by
[1:42:17] the hearing of the year
[1:42:19] but my now mine i csd
[1:42:22] see job is the oldest bible
[1:42:25] and
[1:42:26] we are too much here here here see
[1:42:30] this is the time that god has to open
[1:42:32] your eyes to see something
[1:42:34] you have to see something in this
[1:42:35] message
[1:42:36] you have to see something in your wife
[1:42:38] your husband your children if god
[1:42:40] doesn't open your eyes all you see is
[1:42:43] rottiness failure everything seems bad
[1:42:47] of course the world is all gone and we
[1:42:48] are not proud of this world
[1:42:51] you think you are part of this world oh
[1:42:53] no
[1:42:55] we are just gone
[1:42:56] in god's eyes we are gone already
[1:42:59] so when job was going through all that
[1:43:02] got his friends and all that
[1:43:04] they had not seen anything
[1:43:06] but they were trying to quote trying to
[1:43:08] help him and then he got to a point
[1:43:10] where
[1:43:11] elihu and
[1:43:13] god himself came back
[1:43:15] and when he showed
[1:43:17] job
[1:43:18] all
[1:43:20] the troubles all the needs were gone
[1:43:23] i trust that this morning you walk out
[1:43:25] of here
[1:43:26] knowing that actually everything that
[1:43:29] you need for the journey has been
[1:43:30] provided
[1:43:33] did you hear that
[1:43:36] you know like
[1:43:38] i'm a father before all my kids arrived
[1:43:41] we look at the delivery date
[1:43:43] let's get a let's get the feeding
[1:43:45] bottle let's get everything in place
[1:43:48] if it's a boy yeah we go overboard get a
[1:43:50] blue jacket or a blue blanket or
[1:43:53] something if it's a girl we prepare
[1:43:56] that's we human beings
[1:43:58] don't you think god does the same yeah
[1:44:01] before you came on earth he prepared
[1:44:03] everything he prepared the house you
[1:44:05] live in he prepares the husband he
[1:44:07] prepared everything for you
[1:44:10] it's by faith that we can see that all
[1:44:12] that i needed your hand has provided
[1:44:17] it takes away the fresh the anxiety the
[1:44:20] things from us
[1:44:22] so i'm pointing to you that
[1:44:25] you
[1:44:27] not me
[1:44:29] you
[1:44:31] are the one that god promised in this
[1:44:34] end time
[1:44:36] you are the one that before god created
[1:44:39] the earth
[1:44:40] he taught
[1:44:41] about 2022 easter
[1:44:45] and thought that you'll be alive and
[1:44:48] thought that you will hear this
[1:44:50] message
[1:44:52] and thought that something will stir
[1:44:53] your heart
[1:44:55] to know that
[1:44:56] you are not going backwards you are
[1:44:58] going forward
[1:44:59] to know that your work with him is now
[1:45:01] different
[1:45:02] from yesterday
[1:45:05] you are working with the creator now can
[1:45:07] you imagine you have working with the
[1:45:09] creator
[1:45:11] different thoughts altogether
[1:45:15] and i explained to you yesterday
[1:45:17] elijah
[1:45:18] after the miracle big miracle who can
[1:45:21] call fire from heaven to consume
[1:45:23] sacrifice
[1:45:24] and elijah even let him pour water on it
[1:45:27] yet the next day jesus said elijah i'm
[1:45:29] going to kill you i just started running
[1:45:31] away
[1:45:34] like me out here at night simon brabram
[1:45:37] will preach
[1:45:38] i'm so excited i walk out there
[1:45:41] oh god i didn't think i could get
[1:45:44] through
[1:45:45] it's not a sermon you hear
[1:45:47] it's not the miraculous that happens
[1:45:49] it's what god points to you
[1:45:52] that you are the victor
[1:45:54] i am going to succeed through
[1:45:56] you so elijah
[1:45:59] was running away even in a cave
[1:46:02] they didn't trust any food and iran said
[1:46:04] they didn't he thought even jezebel
[1:46:06] would try to poison him
[1:46:08] so elijah that was fed by ravens fed by
[1:46:11] a woman now god says this man he's going
[1:46:14] to die there's some work for him to do
[1:46:16] so god sends angels
[1:46:19] i didn't know angels were cooks
[1:46:23] they brought their pots
[1:46:26] the barbecue firewood everything went to
[1:46:29] the supermarket god has a supermarket
[1:46:33] but everything that elijah needed
[1:46:36] flip the cakes
[1:46:38] elijah
[1:46:39] i'm 70 on a plate
[1:46:41] elijah ate it he could trust it he could
[1:46:44] trust god
[1:46:46] and then elijah was praying said oh god
[1:46:48] it's left to be me alone and nobody is
[1:46:50] here help me oh god nobody cursed
[1:46:54] and the prophet said when he opened the
[1:46:56] seas the fourth seal
[1:46:59] he showed you like you are not alone
[1:47:01] there are four thousand others
[1:47:03] that have not bowed their knees to
[1:47:05] anyone
[1:47:06] he saw his name
[1:47:08] in the world
[1:47:10] and when elijah saw that name
[1:47:13] he couldn't go and say i've seen my name
[1:47:15] he just kept quiet
[1:47:18] and then one day jezebel made a mistake
[1:47:19] and said i'm going to send soldiers to
[1:47:21] go and bring elijah oh elijah would say
[1:47:23] that if i
[1:47:25] be a servant of god let fire come from
[1:47:28] heaven
[1:47:29] we are coming to that point that we can
[1:47:31] stand and face the devil and say if i be
[1:47:34] a bride of christ you don't have power
[1:47:36] over me
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:38] [Applause]
[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:42] is god showing that
[1:47:45] this is you
[1:47:46] that have been placed in the world
[1:47:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:50] no devil
[1:47:51] satan
[1:47:52] jezebel has power over you when elijah
[1:47:55] saw that his work his everything changed
[1:48:00] maybe you haven't seen it
[1:48:02] but ram said i was always scared
[1:48:05] of dying
[1:48:07] not because
[1:48:08] when i not because god hasn't saved me
[1:48:10] but when i die i will be like a spirit
[1:48:14] so he was always worried
[1:48:16] then one day
[1:48:19] he had a translation he calls it
[1:48:23] different vision you can read it from
[1:48:24] that time
[1:48:25] he said it many times
[1:48:29] and somebody kept telling him press on
[1:48:31] press on press on
[1:48:33] and he thought about it
[1:48:35] and all of a sudden
[1:48:39] he saw people coming
[1:48:42] some came to him
[1:48:45] thank you brother brown
[1:48:47] thank you for the word
[1:48:49] some came and even hugged him
[1:48:51] and then the angel point to him that
[1:48:53] this lady you led her
[1:48:55] to christ
[1:48:56] when she was 90 years old young
[1:49:03] he saw himself over there
[1:49:05] when he saw himself over there
[1:49:07] now you know it changed him completely
[1:49:12] i couldn't believe there is a man that
[1:49:13] can preach two or three services a day
[1:49:16] everywhere
[1:49:18] now you wonder
[1:49:19] because when he saw himself in heaven
[1:49:22] with those that he's preached to convey
[1:49:24] it
[1:49:25] he knew
[1:49:26] there's a land somewhere that gave him
[1:49:28] the assurance
[1:49:30] because he was there he saw them
[1:49:33] and can you believe in the congregation
[1:49:35] he said some of you said in you i saw
[1:49:37] you over there
[1:49:40] he has to be there to see them also
[1:49:43] his life changed
[1:49:45] he wanted to preach every day of his
[1:49:48] life if there's anything he can do
[1:49:50] i'm bringing you to a point where this
[1:49:52] is that bride this is the last bride
[1:49:54] this is the last children of god
[1:49:56] that god promised
[1:49:58] maybe you thought the bride will be tall
[1:50:00] and short and slim or something
[1:50:03] but that's what god has got
[1:50:06] so when he saw that
[1:50:10] death by ram you read the messages every
[1:50:13] day he's preaching why
[1:50:15] because
[1:50:16] he saw that
[1:50:18] there is more people out there
[1:50:20] that have to be awakened
[1:50:22] that he has seen your name there
[1:50:25] now he couldn't come to you and say i've
[1:50:26] seen your name there so you are going to
[1:50:27] be there god has to show you
[1:50:30] but he changed the prophet's own life
[1:50:33] that many things that he was struggling
[1:50:35] with he didn't have to worry about it
[1:50:37] anymore
[1:50:38] they hugged him
[1:50:40] he even saw his dog over there and
[1:50:42] people were wondering you mean dog in
[1:50:44] heaven
[1:50:48] i believe he saw
[1:50:50] some of us over there
[1:50:53] he can't come here so when you listen to
[1:50:55] the terms he might point you to
[1:50:57] something but god has to through the
[1:50:58] tapes speak to you and say
[1:51:00] robert
[1:51:02] your name is there
[1:51:04] it changes everything you want
[1:51:07] it changes your atmosphere
[1:51:10] john 6 57 says
[1:51:12] as the living father has sent me and i
[1:51:14] live by the father so he that eateth me
[1:51:17] even he shall live by me and this is
[1:51:20] jesus
[1:51:21] john 6 58
[1:51:23] this is that bread
[1:51:25] that which came from heaven
[1:51:27] not as your fathers did eat manna and
[1:51:29] are dead he that eateth of this bread
[1:51:32] shall live forever so
[1:51:35] we talked about the manner that was such
[1:51:36] a miracle
[1:51:38] they had manner and they all died
[1:51:41] they had mana and they all backslid
[1:51:45] they all had mana and they were all
[1:51:46] cursing god
[1:51:48] but the real manner you see because god
[1:51:50] goes with types and antitypes the real
[1:51:53] manner that was coming is jesus christ
[1:51:56] and so people take the death of jesus
[1:51:58] christ oh what a nice wonderful thing
[1:52:01] but we have to eat that bread
[1:52:03] we have to come to that tree of life and
[1:52:06] partake of that tree
[1:52:08] then we'll live forever
[1:52:10] in one place i believe in john he says
[1:52:12] he that believeth on me
[1:52:15] have passed from death onto life
[1:52:18] when you read the scripture you think
[1:52:20] about it think about it
[1:52:21] but just imagine
[1:52:23] you are driving through chicago if
[1:52:25] you've been to chicago you don't want to
[1:52:27] go to the downtown
[1:52:29] so you ask yourself is there a bypass
[1:52:32] can i just go to where i'm going without
[1:52:34] going through chicago
[1:52:36] when you believe in jesus christ
[1:52:38] he that believeth on me you bypass death
[1:52:42] there is a bypass
[1:52:45] you don't have to die
[1:52:48] and so
[1:52:49] christ is the one that has been
[1:52:51] positioned
[1:52:52] that through him we can have a bypass
[1:52:56] that death have no victory over us
[1:53:01] i mean when god shows you
[1:53:04] that this is you are the one that i died
[1:53:06] for
[1:53:07] you realize something in your life that
[1:53:10] even death has no power over you
[1:53:14] sickness has no power over you
[1:53:18] you have to just be like elijah take a
[1:53:20] stand
[1:53:21] if i be a child of god
[1:53:23] sickness i'll shake you out
[1:53:28] i'm trying to bring this to
[1:53:30] a point
[1:53:32] so the manner that fell
[1:53:36] did not give them eternal life
[1:53:39] but this manner
[1:53:41] has eternal life
[1:53:45] the manner that carried the children of
[1:53:47] israel through the wilderness
[1:53:50] that's the manner
[1:53:52] but this holy ghost times the manner
[1:53:55] as he kept them all through the promised
[1:53:57] land this manner will also take us to
[1:53:59] our destination
[1:54:01] so
[1:54:02] he died
[1:54:04] his spirit
[1:54:05] that we know is from
[1:54:06] god god did not take it away
[1:54:09] he distributed it on the day of
[1:54:11] pentecost
[1:54:12] so peter had to find a way to tell them
[1:54:14] that listen the jesus you crucified is
[1:54:16] not dead at all
[1:54:18] the clothing tongues you see and people
[1:54:20] shaking and swaying
[1:54:23] no they are not drunk
[1:54:25] this end time woman might not be shaking
[1:54:28] when i might not be swaying
[1:54:29] but we've been ordained to live a life
[1:54:32] eternal life
[1:54:35] so if you look for the swain and things
[1:54:37] you are going to miss it
[1:54:40] this is the time of a life
[1:54:43] this is the time of eternal life
[1:54:46] i know we still are attracted with the
[1:54:48] minute person you go to church and
[1:54:50] somebody spoke in tongues and somebody
[1:54:52] do that let me tell you you can speak in
[1:54:54] tongues all your life and still end up
[1:54:56] in hell
[1:54:59] every gift can be impersonated
[1:55:02] the only thing that cannot be
[1:55:03] impersonated is the life
[1:55:07] no one can impersonate the life you live
[1:55:11] and this is not your life this is god's
[1:55:13] life
[1:55:14] that has come to you
[1:55:16] there there's only one eternal life
[1:55:20] the angels don't even have it they were
[1:55:22] created
[1:55:24] and if before the foundation of the
[1:55:26] world was laid you are not part of god
[1:55:28] you can never be part of him
[1:55:31] you were always part of him
[1:55:34] you are only just manifested today
[1:55:37] not to live your life but for his glory
[1:55:41] i will tell you this morning this is
[1:55:43] that bride that brother brahm spoke
[1:55:46] about
[1:55:55] jesus one day
[1:55:57] everybody was looking at him this must
[1:56:00] be a prophet
[1:56:02] and everybody was confused
[1:56:05] but if you read luke chapter 4 one day
[1:56:07] he went to the temple the bible says
[1:56:10] took the scriptures
[1:56:12] read isaiah 61.
[1:56:15] this
[1:56:15] the spirit of god is upon me
[1:56:18] because the lord had anointed me to
[1:56:20] preach good tidings onto the meek
[1:56:22] he has sent me to bind up the
[1:56:24] broken-hearted to proclaim liberty to
[1:56:26] the captive and the opening of the
[1:56:28] prison to them that are bound
[1:56:31] he broke in the middle of the sentence
[1:56:34] he could have said this is that person
[1:56:36] yes he said this day
[1:56:38] this scripture
[1:56:39] is fulfilled
[1:56:42] and this is the man standing there
[1:56:44] and people were going back to isaiah to
[1:56:45] read it
[1:56:47] but that scripture has been made alive
[1:56:49] in a human being
[1:56:55] so
[1:56:56] look at how god works he speaks the
[1:56:58] scripture
[1:57:00] then he for ordained somebody to be
[1:57:02] there so that the scripture will be
[1:57:04] embodied in the person
[1:57:09] god has to speak
[1:57:11] a bride with a sport or wrinkle
[1:57:13] so he can fall down a bride
[1:57:16] and let that bright
[1:57:18] that scripture be embodied in a bride
[1:57:21] and he's looking they're looking at him
[1:57:22] i said this is a human being he he
[1:57:25] i don't even like the way he looks he
[1:57:27] looks he looks you know he doesn't look
[1:57:29] anybody that i i really like i don't
[1:57:31] like the way he does things it's not
[1:57:33] your likes it's what god likes
[1:57:39] i don't like the way he looks his nose i
[1:57:42] don't like he's always sneezing he's
[1:57:46] and i'm sure if you were around christ
[1:57:48] there were some things you like to
[1:57:49] straighten him out
[1:57:51] [Music]
[1:57:52] like the prophet people came and said
[1:57:54] the way you pronounce your pulpit
[1:57:56] the way you do this
[1:57:58] he said you know
[1:58:01] it's not how much you know the scripture
[1:58:04] but it's knowing the author amen and i
[1:58:07] know the utter really well
[1:58:10] it's all we said you go on what you do
[1:58:12] but knowing that you are part of him
[1:58:16] and that's why you are here
[1:58:17] you are not here for any reason because
[1:58:20] god for ordained you to be here
[1:58:23] so death
[1:58:25] releases
[1:58:26] the word of god
[1:58:29] can you imagine him standing there this
[1:58:30] day the scripture is fulfilled people
[1:58:31] were looking around what is he talking
[1:58:33] about
[1:58:35] today we'll look at youtube
[1:58:37] find out he said this scripture is
[1:58:38] fulfilled where
[1:58:40] you mean this bible
[1:58:42] i read isaac but he said the scripture
[1:58:44] is fulfilled so they are looking at him
[1:58:46] can we say he's a prophet we don't know
[1:58:48] can we say is this
[1:58:50] so the scripture was fulfilled in the
[1:58:52] eyes god pointed it out to them
[1:58:56] yet they doubt it
[1:58:58] this bride
[1:59:00] will not fail
[1:59:02] you will not fail to see god in your
[1:59:04] life
[1:59:06] you will not miss it
[1:59:08] if you miss it then maybe you are not
[1:59:10] bright or you don't have the holy ghost
[1:59:12] because if you miss it god has failed
[1:59:15] so when you point at this day this
[1:59:17] scripture is fulfilled people's eyes
[1:59:19] were on him you mean this scripture that
[1:59:22] was written by isaac is fulfilled in
[1:59:24] this person
[1:59:26] don't doubt it
[1:59:27] never doubt
[1:59:28] it
[1:59:30] this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes
[1:59:33] this bride
[1:59:35] that
[1:59:36] god talked about
[1:59:38] there are many scriptures and i'm sure
[1:59:39] pastor will pick it up but what i'm
[1:59:40] trying to bring you the little time we
[1:59:42] have is that god is doing something
[1:59:45] supernatural
[1:59:47] in your life
[1:59:49] by the holy ghost just believe it
[1:59:52] and just ask him for more of the spirit
[1:59:54] so that you can live for him
[2:00:01] jesus knew who he was
[2:00:04] so when he stood there and the devil
[2:00:05] says if you are
[2:00:07] really the son of man come down i'm sure
[2:00:10] he laughed and said if i even came down
[2:00:12] you would not believe it
[2:00:17] but they have thieves crucified with him
[2:00:20] one of them thought
[2:00:22] i i doubted that you know what you are
[2:00:24] talking about otherwise you would have
[2:00:26] saved yourself and saved all of us if he
[2:00:28] did that this bride in this age would
[2:00:31] not be there
[2:00:33] but there was one somehow on the cross
[2:00:35] through pain he realized
[2:00:38] you know sometimes we think god is not
[2:00:41] going to do it but i believe that if on
[2:00:43] the cross somehow god spoke to him
[2:00:46] i said this man
[2:00:48] that is by you
[2:00:51] he's the one that is taking you there i
[2:00:54] put your name already his name was there
[2:00:56] already
[2:00:58] because god is not going to add to it
[2:01:02] so this man caught a derivation
[2:01:06] if you go there remember me and he said
[2:01:08] today you'll be with me amen
[2:01:10] now if christ was lost that man was lost
[2:01:13] but we know he was never lost
[2:01:16] so god for ordained both of them one was
[2:01:19] lost
[2:01:19] one was saved
[2:01:21] and so as we walk here god has fought
[2:01:23] ordained people
[2:01:24] everybody unbelievers believers make
[2:01:27] believers but i believe everybody here
[2:01:29] is a believer because what happens is
[2:01:32] that somehow you hear an inner voice
[2:01:35] that quickens your face that you are
[2:01:36] part of him
[2:01:38] i am part of god
[2:01:40] i am proud of god
[2:01:42] we are almost there
[2:01:44] so john 6 64
[2:01:46] jesus talks about it he said but there
[2:01:48] are some of you that believe not
[2:01:50] why jesus knew from the beginning
[2:01:54] who they were that believe not
[2:01:57] so everything that god does is for
[2:02:00] ordained
[2:02:02] it's made that way so god knowing
[2:02:05] there'll be unbelievers
[2:02:08] they
[2:02:11] he made sure that
[2:02:13] some people were blinded
[2:02:15] somebody asked abraham this question
[2:02:16] would the bride
[2:02:18] of christ have
[2:02:20] a ministry before the rapture
[2:02:23] any time i read this i thought
[2:02:26] oh i'm going to heal people
[2:02:28] i'm going to have a prayer line
[2:02:31] i'm going to jump and
[2:02:33] we all got caught up in it
[2:02:36] so they told him that yes is the message
[2:02:38] of the hour she's consists of apostles
[2:02:41] prophet teachers evangelists and pastors
[2:02:43] she's got a ministry great ministry he's
[2:02:46] the minister of the world ah
[2:02:48] but we miss the last part it will be so
[2:02:50] humble
[2:02:52] god doesn't make publicity
[2:02:54] otherwise he would have brought a
[2:02:56] prophet when youtube and cnn were on
[2:02:58] there
[2:03:03] if that even gives us understanding
[2:03:06] we become now skeptical of youtube
[2:03:09] skeptical all that because god i told
[2:03:12] you yesterday he let pharaoh raise moses
[2:03:17] under his own nose
[2:03:18] so he can come and destroy his kingdom
[2:03:22] god is raising a bride right under the
[2:03:24] nose of the devil
[2:03:26] everybody is distracted
[2:03:28] [Applause]
[2:03:30] don't let youtube distract you don't let
[2:03:32] whatsapp distract you god is here
[2:03:34] raising a bride
[2:03:36] and it's so simple
[2:03:38] unless he tells you that this is that
[2:03:39] right
[2:03:41] you go from church to church i hear this
[2:03:43] great preacher he can preach oh he can
[2:03:45] quote
[2:03:46] it doesn't mean anything
[2:03:48] if you made it that's what makes sense
[2:03:54] so we
[2:03:57] are always making a big deal
[2:04:00] and god is always making a little deal
[2:04:03] in some way in the bible he said this is
[2:04:05] the day of small things
[2:04:09] those were the time that there was a big
[2:04:10] name coming to town so let's all go and
[2:04:13] preach let's all go oh i'll travel five
[2:04:15] miles 10 miles 20 miles that's a big
[2:04:18] preacher i i know some of most of them
[2:04:20] are my friend i'm not going to use their
[2:04:21] names to make it sound negative but i'm
[2:04:23] trying to make you is that god is here
[2:04:26] the same holy ghost do we have two holy
[2:04:28] ghosts or one
[2:04:30] can they say holy ghost come on the
[2:04:31] pastor to preach that sermon
[2:04:34] so what is shaking has to go back and
[2:04:36] forth
[2:04:37] if god shows you this is this church you
[2:04:39] will never miss a beat
[2:04:44] if god shows you this is the message
[2:04:46] no one can convince you of anything else
[2:04:51] if god shows you this is where to live
[2:04:53] he can nothing can change
[2:04:56] oh i've lived in detroit for a while let
[2:04:57] me go to chicago and try out oh let me
[2:04:59] why not take a step back and say lord
[2:05:01] where did you plan to place me
[2:05:06] where he places you
[2:05:08] that's what matters
[2:05:09] sometimes i get people telling me you
[2:05:11] know i do a lot of mission work and i go
[2:05:13] to places that you wouldn't like to go
[2:05:16] don't you think it's dangerous
[2:05:19] and i always tell them the safest place
[2:05:22] is where god places you
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:26] not what somebody tells you or you go on
[2:05:28] internet and say
[2:05:30] chicago is safe
[2:05:31] i don't know which internet you were
[2:05:33] reading
[2:05:36] there's nowhere safe here
[2:05:38] it's where god shows you that this is
[2:05:40] where you have to be
[2:05:41] [Applause]
[2:05:43] because you walk by revelation
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:47] if this is the church may god give you
[2:05:49] revelation now this is the place to be
[2:05:53] we are no more working halfway sadly i
[2:05:56] tried this one didn't work so i tried
[2:05:58] this job didn't work those days are over
[2:06:00] we don't have time to do that
[2:06:03] oh i better try to end this
[2:06:06] how many minutes have i got 12 30.
[2:06:10] acts 2 38.
[2:06:14] peter said unto them the same peter so
[2:06:16] we script all the way to fill in the
[2:06:19] gaps now peter said unto them repent
[2:06:22] and be baptized
[2:06:24] every one of you in the name of jesus
[2:06:26] christ
[2:06:28] your repentance has to be in the name of
[2:06:30] jesus christ not just any repentance
[2:06:33] for the remission of your sins because
[2:06:35] remedies remission
[2:06:37] can only come by blood
[2:06:40] by blood we are purified
[2:06:42] if you read that scripture and read it
[2:06:44] and read it that's an easter scripture
[2:06:48] because when he died
[2:06:50] by his blood now there can be
[2:06:52] forgiveness
[2:06:53] there can be remission
[2:06:56] so his blood has now made people pure
[2:06:59] praise
[2:07:00] that they never wear
[2:07:02] in some places the mom says
[2:07:05] even the angels are impure before him
[2:07:08] and i thought
[2:07:10] how god the whole pure white angels are
[2:07:14] dirty
[2:07:15] then i studied and i stayed in i come
[2:07:17] back and then the holy ghost point to me
[2:07:20] the purest
[2:07:22] purest in god's eyes
[2:07:26] he's the person that has been cleansed
[2:07:27] by his blood
[2:07:32] angels never fail
[2:07:34] they don't need the blood they just made
[2:07:36] them and they just go where god tells
[2:07:38] them
[2:07:39] but we
[2:07:41] in the presence of god in the eyes of
[2:07:43] god are even purer than his angels
[2:07:48] i know sometimes you go places and oh an
[2:07:50] angel came to me and we are all
[2:07:52] shivering
[2:07:53] oh a son of god and an angel of god
[2:07:59] so because christ died
[2:08:01] amen
[2:08:03] and my sins have gone amen i have power
[2:08:07] in the presence of god
[2:08:10] that the angels didn't even have
[2:08:13] god never trusted the preaching of the
[2:08:16] gospel to angels amen
[2:08:19] but he trusted it to me and you
[2:08:23] god could have had angels as a bride
[2:08:26] but he decided me and you are the bride
[2:08:30] [Applause]
[2:08:36] at the whole heaven the whole angels
[2:08:38] that satan everybody is wondering
[2:08:40] there's something pure you could have
[2:08:42] used
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:44] they forget who god is
[2:08:47] he's a creator
[2:08:49] he can take from nothing and make
[2:08:51] something out of it
[2:08:54] [Applause]
[2:08:59] if you don't see easter this way then
[2:09:01] you haven't missed you have missed it
[2:09:04] christ died so he can take me
[2:09:07] nothing and make something out of me
[2:09:12] it shocks the devil
[2:09:14] it shocks every demon
[2:09:17] and we make mistakes every day but is
[2:09:19] there blood that sanctifies us every day
[2:09:22] of our life
[2:09:23] [Applause]
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:28] so you and the mistakes you make and the
[2:09:32] blood
[2:09:33] which is more powerful
[2:09:38] before you make a mistake the blood was
[2:09:40] shed because god knew you
[2:09:44] [Applause]
[2:09:47] before david could make a mistake
[2:09:51] god knew david amen and i was thinking
[2:09:54] david
[2:09:55] a man after his own
[2:09:56] heart and he can cry my god my god why
[2:09:59] has you forsaken me
[2:10:01] but david came to one point he says
[2:10:04] though i walked through the shadow of
[2:10:05] death
[2:10:07] i david will fear no evil
[2:10:12] i will tell you this morning
[2:10:14] this is that bride that will fear no
[2:10:16] evil
[2:10:17] because christ is with his bride
[2:10:20] [Applause]
[2:10:26] so he says repent and be baptized in the
[2:10:29] name of jesus christ
[2:10:31] if you haven't done it please do it
[2:10:34] don't be persuaded unless something
[2:10:36] speaks to you to today go do it
[2:10:39] i've been in places i speak to them like
[2:10:42] this people will come after me midnight
[2:10:44] let's go do it
[2:10:46] do it he will take you there
[2:10:49] i will stop my going i will take you
[2:10:51] there because you have to repent
[2:10:53] you have to be baptized this is
[2:10:54] scripture oh i today i didn't bring a
[2:10:58] change of clothes you are listening to
[2:10:59] the devil
[2:11:02] who gave you that clothes
[2:11:06] and i've had people i remember i was in
[2:11:07] morocco i was a driver we're going there
[2:11:10] and says can i be baptized i say yeah
[2:11:12] but i don't have clothes i said don't
[2:11:13] worry he didn't know i said stop here
[2:11:15] come he went and bought clothes
[2:11:18] and then he said it doesn't fit me i
[2:11:19] said my goodness
[2:11:22] let's go find another one
[2:11:24] so he bought the clothes that fit we got
[2:11:26] to the
[2:11:26] show and he said there are too many
[2:11:28] people here
[2:11:29] i say you keep listening to the devil
[2:11:32] you keep listening to the devil
[2:11:34] so finally he agreed we baptized him
[2:11:37] now we went back to church
[2:11:40] and you couldn't hold him down
[2:11:43] something
[2:11:45] took place in his life
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:48] something has to check you to say that
[2:11:50] this might be the last time
[2:11:52] you might not have life again tomorrow
[2:11:56] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[2:11:58] christ
[2:12:00] and you shall receive it's a gift
[2:12:04] of the holy ghost that's the only way
[2:12:06] god has laid down of course there have
[2:12:08] been people thief on the cross so many
[2:12:10] excuses that's good but i'm not going to
[2:12:12] be an exception
[2:12:15] just do it
[2:12:17] it's not for the pastor to pay more
[2:12:20] tithes or do something it's for you
[2:12:23] and if god drives your heart to do it
[2:12:25] you'll see the change you'll see the
[2:12:28] difference
[2:12:29] i wish i can give you the holy ghost i
[2:12:31] can do it but god has laid the formula
[2:12:34] so this is that way to get the holy
[2:12:37] ghost
[2:12:38] this is that way this is that promise
[2:12:41] 239 says for the promises unto you and
[2:12:44] to your children
[2:12:47] we become so many times we read the
[2:12:50] scripture it goes from one year to the
[2:12:51] other
[2:12:52] i pray this morning
[2:12:54] god will do something to you amen
[2:12:57] in genesis chapter 3
[2:13:00] verse 24 he says so he that is god drove
[2:13:03] out the men the man
[2:13:06] and he placed at the east of the garden
[2:13:07] of eden cherubims
[2:13:09] and the flaming sword which turned every
[2:13:11] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[2:13:14] remember when adam and eve fell
[2:13:17] god said if i don't protect the tree of
[2:13:20] life
[2:13:21] they'll go and take the tree of life and
[2:13:23] then sin will be here forever so the
[2:13:25] bible says he put flame
[2:13:28] cherubims to prevent them from taking
[2:13:31] the tree of life
[2:13:34] for all the ages
[2:13:37] god had prevented man
[2:13:39] from taking off the tree of life
[2:13:42] but here the prophet said
[2:13:44] now god is actually driving us back to
[2:13:47] the tree of life
[2:13:48] because that's where eternal life lies
[2:13:52] how is he driving you
[2:13:53] and he says the same holy ghost we are
[2:13:56] talking about was that flaming
[2:13:58] fire
[2:13:59] that prevented them now the holy ghost
[2:14:02] is bringing us back to that tree
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:05] this is that flame that is bringing us
[2:14:08] back to eternal life
[2:14:11] no excuses
[2:14:13] you will not have any excuse today
[2:14:16] if you have not been baptized
[2:14:18] please be baptized
[2:14:20] if you have not received the holy ghost
[2:14:23] we're going to pray
[2:14:25] i pray god will give you the holy ghost
[2:14:27] if you have received it may he give you
[2:14:29] more
[2:14:31] but we are getting out of here
[2:14:33] this is the spirit that was in christ
[2:14:35] that raised christ from the dead
[2:14:38] otherwise easter story will be different
[2:14:40] amen
[2:14:41] and this is the same spirit we need to
[2:14:43] raise us up from here
[2:14:45] i can't say it any other way
[2:14:47] this is that spirit
[2:14:49] that will raise us from the dead
[2:14:52] this is that spirit that is taking us in
[2:14:55] the rapture amen this is that spirit
[2:14:57] that you need to walk every day
[2:14:59] this is the spirit that the devil is
[2:15:01] cared about
[2:15:03] [Applause]
[2:15:05] and god has shed it
[2:15:07] freely
[2:15:09] and his death
[2:15:10] now
[2:15:12] god is enforcing it
[2:15:14] because death brings enforcement
[2:15:17] let me close with this
[2:15:22] mark 16 16 he said he that believeth and
[2:15:24] he's baptized shall be saved
[2:15:26] you know there are many believers
[2:15:29] that many times we look at it and
[2:15:32] are struggling i believe
[2:15:35] he says these sons shall follow them
[2:15:38] it's not you that is manufacturing the
[2:15:40] science it's god that is enforcing the
[2:15:42] science in your life
[2:15:46] i i brought this thought yesterday
[2:15:50] that many people
[2:15:51] have received the holy ghost
[2:15:54] we receive enough
[2:15:56] to go to church
[2:15:58] to listen to the tapes
[2:16:00] to
[2:16:02] say amen
[2:16:04] to do whatever that sounds like good
[2:16:07] but god wants to feel every fiber of you
[2:16:11] he wants to have total control by the
[2:16:13] holy ghost
[2:16:14] he wants to feel your thinking
[2:16:16] he wants to completely make you dead to
[2:16:18] yourself accept what the holy ghost will
[2:16:21] do
[2:16:22] how many this morning will say lord
[2:16:25] i want to be there to myself
[2:16:27] i want you to feel me more
[2:16:30] let's stand up to our feet
[2:16:35] and say lord
[2:16:36] i open my heart and soul to you
[2:16:40] now i've heard that i am it
[2:16:42] there's no other one
[2:16:45] now coming
[2:16:45] heard that this is that spirit
[2:16:47] that take me will take me out of here
[2:16:51] let's raise our hands to him
[2:16:54] and say lord
[2:16:55] whatever it takes
[2:16:57] today
[2:16:59] fill me
[2:17:00] with your spirit
[2:17:02] let me receive more of your spirit
[2:17:05] let me be dead to myself
[2:17:08] lord jesus
[2:17:11] you know they raised up hands their
[2:17:12] hearts
[2:17:14] today let us go
[2:17:15] by your word
[2:17:17] and realize that
[2:17:19] you not only died for us
[2:17:21] but you die so you can give us your
[2:17:22] spirit
[2:17:24] to be able to continue the work that
[2:17:25] you've laid
[2:17:26] i pray o god
[2:17:28] every hungry heart here may they receive
[2:17:31] your spirit may we all receive your
[2:17:33] spirit
[2:17:34] may your spirit fall afresh on us and oh
[2:17:37] god that our lives will be sure
[2:17:40] and will be perfect i submit everyone
[2:17:43] here to you
[2:17:44] it's a journey that we are taking
[2:17:46] but just like you took israel through
[2:17:48] the promised land
[2:17:50] to the promised land filing them every
[2:17:52] day the holy ghost is here
[2:17:54] a type of the manner to take us to our
[2:17:57] destination
[2:17:58] i pray open our eyes
[2:18:01] open our ears open our hearts
[2:18:04] that we can see you in the name of jesus
[2:18:06] we pray
[2:18:08] amen
[2:18:10] amen
[2:18:12] continue to pray don't leave it here
[2:18:15] because
[2:18:16] what is a preacher to do

[2:18:44] me go where

[2:18:47] i rarely go out
[2:18:49] but when you have that confidence
[2:18:52] you walk differently i didn't come here
[2:18:54] to

[2:24:24] that moses spoke about
[2:24:26] so was moses wrong no
[2:24:29] when moses said this is that it was that
[2:24:32] for them that day amen
[2:24:35] and then what jesus was pointing to was
[2:24:37] the
[2:24:40] progression praise the lord
[2:24:43] now look here and it's in john chapter
[2:24:45] 6.
[2:24:47] the bible says here from verse 63
[2:24:51] it is the spirit that quickeneth
[2:24:54] the flesh prophet nothing
[2:24:57] the word that i speak unto you
[2:25:00] they are spirit
[2:25:02] and they are life
[2:25:04] i believe that's the words that was
[2:25:06] spoken to us this morning
[2:25:08] this word is spirit in his life
[2:25:10] it take god to show you that this is
[2:25:13] that
[2:25:14] amen
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:16] and as the old saints goes if this is
[2:25:19] not there we will hold two days
[2:25:21] until that comes
[2:25:24] amen
[2:25:27] verse 64 but there are some of you
[2:25:31] that believe not
[2:25:34] for jesus knew from the beginning
[2:25:37] who they wear that believe not
[2:25:40] now see the place is going now dealing
[2:25:42] with those that don't believe
[2:25:44] and who should betray him
[2:25:47] and he said unto them
[2:25:49] therefore
[2:25:51] say i unto you that no man can come unto
[2:25:54] me and accept
[2:25:56] a way giving unto him of my father
[2:26:00] now watch this now
[2:26:02] verse 66
[2:26:05] and from
[2:26:06] from that time
[2:26:09] many of his disciples went back
[2:26:13] and walked no more with him
[2:26:16] we are reading from saint john
[2:26:19] chapter 6
[2:26:21] verse 66
[2:26:23] do you see the mark of the beast
[2:26:28] it's not a tattoo
[2:26:30] it's the rejection
[2:26:32] of the word of god
[2:26:35] after you have heard the truth of god's
[2:26:37] word
[2:26:38] to walk away from it
[2:26:40] you have stepped yourself
[2:26:42] [Music]
[2:26:46] it's all through the bible
[2:26:49] it's not a tattoo on your body or a
[2:26:50] tattoo on your forehead
[2:26:53] he was he was speaking to them
[2:26:56] that did not believe
[2:26:59] they went back from that service
[2:27:05] and walk with him
[2:27:06] no more
[2:27:08] [Music]
[2:27:09] god do not make mistake god is the
[2:27:12] author of this word
[2:27:16] in symbols in raiders in mysteries
[2:27:20] whatever we want to call it
[2:27:22] god has laid out his word
[2:27:27] that there is a verse that confirmed
[2:27:29] every verse
[2:27:33] all people say the vastness of the mark
[2:27:34] of the beast don't take devastating you
[2:27:36] will get the mark of the beast
[2:27:38] and they will say all of these things
[2:27:39] and there is just a lot of horrible
[2:27:41] things on on on the internet
[2:27:44] when they were not there when they would
[2:27:46] not even accept the very god
[2:27:49] that has given his own life
[2:27:56] your attitude to the word
[2:28:00] your rejection of truth
[2:28:04] you have sealed yourself
[2:28:07] from god's kingdom
[2:28:10] an opportunity is given
[2:28:13] it's not a tattoo it's a rejection
[2:28:24] [Music]
[2:28:25] let us pray
