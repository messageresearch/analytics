[4:58] does not commit sin. The worshipper once
[5:01] purge has no more conscience of sin, no
[5:03] more desire to sin. The sin questions
[5:06] over. You become a part of God in
[5:11] Christ. Christ died to redeem you. Now,
[5:16] just think of all that we would have
[5:18] been if it hadn't been for God. But God
[5:21] in his rich
[5:24] mercy, how he has redeemed us tonight.
[5:28] Where would we been tonight if it hadn't
[5:29] been for God's rich mercy upon us once
[5:33] the world was so sinful that man had
[5:37] caused corruption to come upon the earth
[5:39] until it even grieved God that he ever
[5:42] made man? The whole head was uh putified
[5:48] sore. The whole body and God even greed
[5:53] that he ever made a man. So he said, "I
[5:57] will destroy man who I've created. He
[6:00] will destroy him because he is nothing
[6:03] but just a bunch of corruption." And the
[6:06] whole human race would have been wiped
[6:08] out at that time.
[6:10] But God rich in mercy would not let the
[6:16] innocent perish with the
[6:18] guilty. And he went away and made a
[6:22] provided way for the ones that wanted to
[6:27] come in, that wanted to do what was
[6:28] right. He made a way of mercy for those
[6:31] who desired mercy. And he prepared an
[6:35] ark. In other words, he uh put some
[6:39] wings on his eagles that they could fly
[6:41] above the judgment and not drown with
[6:43] the chickens. But he um he made a way of
[6:46] an escape in the days of Noah. This
[6:48] caused him to do that to provide it
[6:50] because he was rich in mercy. Amen. But
[6:55] after he has provided a way for people
[6:58] and then they refuse it. Now the reason
[7:02] they refuse it is because there's
[7:04] nothing in there to receive it.
[7:08] There's nothing to receive it. My mother
[7:11] used to say you cannot get blood from a
[7:12] turnup because there's no blood in a
[7:15] turnup. So if there is no form of life
[7:18] in there to receive it, then it cannot
[7:22] be received.
[7:23] That's the reason the Pharisees could
[7:26] look right in the face of Jesus and call
[7:27] him be the eliv
[7:29] because there was nothing in them to
[7:32] receive him. But all the father has
[7:35] given me, he said, will come to me.
[7:37] There there's some way it's going to be
[7:39] presented. You can talk to people
[7:41] sometime on the streets. Talk to them
[7:43] about the Lord. They laugh right in your
[7:45] face. Well, we're supposed to do it
[7:47] anyhow. But listen, there's no man can
[7:51] come to me except my father draws him
[7:53] first. God has to do the drawing. There
[7:56] has to be a life. And all that he has
[7:58] given me will come to me. He made a
[8:01] provision for those who wants to be
[8:04] redeemed. He made a provision for those
[8:06] who wants to be healed. And then because
[8:09] that he did this makes him rich in mercy
[8:13] as he's always been rich in mercy. It
[8:16] must u uh be if you refuse this there's
[8:20] nothing left but the judgment because
[8:22] sin must be judged. Pharaoh when he went
[8:26] into the the sea as an impersonator
[8:30] seeing that he could go in like Moses
[8:33] did. Moses with his army and Pharaoh
[8:37] with his army. Both of them should have
[8:39] perished in the sea looked like. But
[8:42] God, rich in mercy, made a way of escape
[8:45] for the Hebrew children. Why? Because
[8:48] they were following in the line of duty.
[8:50] They were following in the word. Amen.
[8:54] Now, that's the only way to obtain mercy
[8:57] is to follow the instructions that God
[8:59] has given us to follow him. That's the
[9:02] only way he can show mercy is when we
[9:04] follow what he said do.
[9:07] as a little debate not long ago with a
[9:11] minister that said that I was teaching
[9:14] an apostolic doctrine in this day. I
[9:16] believe I spoke of it a night or two ago
[9:18] or sometime about how he said you're
[9:20] trying to inject into this age an
[9:23] apostolic doctrine. He said the
[9:26] apostolic age ceased with the apostles.
[9:29] I asked him well do you believe the
[9:31] word? He said yes. I said Revelations
[9:34] 22:18 says that who shall ever shall
[9:37] take one word out of this or add one
[9:39] word to it. Not just two words, one
[9:42] word. Take one word out. Said I believe
[9:45] that. I said then I can tell you where
[9:49] the apostolic age was given. The
[9:52] apostolic blessings was given to the
[9:54] church. Now you tell me where God taken
[9:57] it out of the church by the word. You
[10:00] can't do it. It's not there. I said,
[10:02] "Now remember that Peter on the day of
[10:06] Pentecost, he was the the introducer of
[10:09] the apostolic age and he told them all
[10:12] to repent and be baptized in the name of
[10:14] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
[10:16] and you shall receive the gift of the
[10:18] Holy Ghost. For the promise isn't to you
[10:21] and to your children, and to them as far
[10:23] off, even as many as the Lord our God
[10:26] shall call." Amen. Now, if you want to
[10:29] listen to the clucking of some
[10:30] denominational hen and live back out
[10:33] there in the things of the world, then
[10:36] it goes to show that there's something
[10:38] wrong.
[10:40] Because that is the word.
[10:43] Whosoever will may come. And if you've
[10:46] got a will, you should come. But if you
[10:49] have no will, then you're in a sad
[10:51] condition. But if you've got a will to
[10:53] come, come follow God's formula. And he
[10:57] never fails to fulfill what he promised.
[11:00] I once was young and I'm old. I've never
[11:03] seen him fail in his word because he can
[11:06] do anything but fail. He cannot fail.
[11:09] God cannot. It's impossible for God to
[11:12] fail and remain God. He has to to do
[11:15] that.
[11:16] Now, Pharaoh's army tried to impersonate
[11:20] because they wasn't called and they had
[11:22] not that life into the the promise
[11:25] wasn't given to Pharaoh. The promise
[11:28] wasn't given for a promised land. And an
[11:30] impersonator trying to follow a real
[11:32] believer who's called such only makes a
[11:35] mockery out of it. That's what's the
[11:37] matter with our religious system today
[11:39] is too many people trying to impersonate
[11:42] the Holy Spirit. Too many people trying
[11:44] to impersonate the baptism. Too many
[11:47] people trying to impersonate the
[11:48] apostolic age. It's for believers. And
[11:53] that alone, God has made a way rich in
[11:56] mercy that his children would not
[11:58] perish. He's made a way for them. Now,
[12:01] Pharaoh trying to pursue on. He drowned
[12:05] in the very waters that saved Moses and
[12:08] his group.
[12:10] Now Moses did not drown because God is
[12:14] rich in mercy to them who are following
[12:18] his provided way.
[12:21] Amen. Can you see what I mean? That
[12:25] tonight people who don't believe in
[12:27] divine healing, people who do not
[12:29] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[12:30] Ghost, how can they receive anything?
[12:33] God is rich in mercy to those who will
[12:35] follow after him. Amen. Not after a
[12:39] creed, but after God.
[12:42] God is the word that was made flesh and
[12:45] dwelt among us. Now that he might bring
[12:47] forth the other attributes of God, the
[12:50] body Jesus was the body of God, an
[12:54] attribute. Moses seen him pass the back
[12:56] part of him. No man had seen his face.
[12:58] But now we seen
[12:59] him. We have beheld him. Seen him as a
[13:03] sacrifice. Now he was an attribute of
[13:06] God being displayed the word. That's
[13:09] what he was. And when any believer comes
[13:11] to God, he becomes God's attribute of
[13:14] his word. He's used to manifest the word
[13:18] that's promised for that day. Amen.
[13:21] That's right. God rich in mercy has
[13:23] never left us without a testimony.
[13:26] He's rich in mercy. We find out that God
[13:29] was so merciful to Moses out there in
[13:32] that dead sea out in the uh Red Sea out
[13:36] there rather. Then when he said your in
[13:39] Exodus 19 four he said I carried you
[13:44] away on eagle's wings brought you to
[13:47] myself.
[13:49] Carried them on eagle's wings and
[13:52] brought you to myself. There was other
[13:54] man in the middle of that sea out there
[13:57] also trying to impersonate. But what he
[14:01] carried him on eagle's wings. Now God
[14:04] always likens his prophets to eagles.
[14:07] And what was it? Moses was his
[14:12] messenger. and they were following Moses
[14:15] and that was the eagle's wings that they
[14:18] were carried on because he was packing
[14:21] God's message and the people followed
[14:24] that they were following God as they
[14:27] followed Moses with his message of
[14:30] deliverance and the Bible said and he
[14:32] they perish not with them who believe
[14:35] not because God was rich in mercy to him
[14:37] because they were following his
[14:40] commandments. God wants us to follow his
[14:44] commandments. We could say the same
[14:46] about Kora and about Dayan and their
[14:50] gang of unbelieving uh people as they
[14:53] tried uh to impersonate. They tried to
[14:57] to inflict something into God's program.
[15:00] They didn't like a one-man program. They
[15:04] didn't like that. They had to have
[15:05] something to do. Kora said, "Well,
[15:07] there's more holy man than you, Moses.
[15:08] you act like you're the only beach on
[15:10] the or the only pebble on the beach
[15:11] rather and said I you ought to do that
[15:14] and there's more man here and Moses know
[15:16] that he was to carry those children over
[15:19] into the promised land because the
[15:21] promise was given to him and he must
[15:24] pack them to the promised land and today
[15:27] the Holy Spirit is here to vindicate
[15:31] God's word and that's the eagle wing
[15:33] that we're supposed to ride on
[15:37] not some manmade
[15:41] theology, but we are to ride upon the
[15:44] wings of the eagle to the promised land.
[15:48] And here they was going to get a bunch
[15:49] of chickens out there. Corora thought,
[15:51] you know, to come around impersonate
[15:53] this the eagle. And when they did, God
[15:56] said, "Separate yourself from them." And
[16:00] he swallowed up the world. He would have
[16:03] swallowed up the whole thing, the whole
[16:05] creation. But God was rich in mercy to
[16:08] those who are trying to follow his word
[16:13] always. God rich in mercy. Many of them
[16:16] come over on the side with Moses and God
[16:19] opened up the earth and swallowed up the
[16:22] unbeliever. He the unbeliever will
[16:25] always perish. Those who did not believe
[16:28] though they come out and walk for a
[16:30] while but they Jesus said there are
[16:33] everyone dead.
[16:35] Dead is annihilation. They are dead.
[16:39] Just think of them. They come out, seen
[16:42] the miracles of God, seen the great hand
[16:44] of God, enjoyed the mana, and got out
[16:47] there and listened to a man named Balum
[16:52] that perverted the way of God by his
[16:54] teaching, contrary to the word. We're
[16:58] all brethren. So, let's just all get
[17:00] together. That's a another Balum system
[17:03] rising up today. Let's all get together.
[17:06] It will not work. Amen. Let's walk with
[17:09] the eagle. Amen. Jehovah eagle. You're
[17:12] eagle.
[17:15] There's only three saved out of the
[17:16] entire group. Moses, Caleb, and Joshua.
[17:20] The rest of them perished in the
[17:21] wilderness. Jesus said so in St. John
[17:24] the 6th chapter. God in mercy would not
[17:27] let them perish because with the rest of
[17:29] the unbelievers, they all died right
[17:32] there in the wilderness and they are
[17:35] dead. God saved Moses and the eagle
[17:40] believers because they had respect to
[17:43] his word. And today, friend, the only
[17:46] way that we can ever have favor with
[17:48] God, God's rich in mercy today, but
[17:51] we've got to respect what he said about
[17:54] it.
[17:55] You just can't take what somebody else
[17:57] said. You've got to take what God said.
[17:59] He said, "Let every man's word be a lie
[18:01] and mine truth." Today we're told that
[18:04] all you have to do in many places is
[18:06] join church, have a creed or something
[18:08] like that or say a prayer or put your
[18:11] name on a book or be a sprinkled or
[18:14] baptized a certain way or something like
[18:16] that. That's all you have to do. But
[18:18] that's wrong. To be an eagle of God,
[18:20] you've got to follow the word day by
[18:23] day. You've got to continue to feed upon
[18:26] the word.
[18:27] Now, we find them after this time
[18:30] murmuring again, weakening in faith
[18:33] after God had showed mercy to them. And
[18:35] we find them murmuring with God. And
[18:38] when they did, they were dying with
[18:40] snake bites. Well, they deserved it.
[18:44] They certainly did. Anybody that was
[18:47] uh mistake God's word and do these
[18:50] things that they did, they deserve to
[18:52] die. Every one of them desire deserved
[18:54] to die in the wilderness. But when they
[18:57] were so sick that even Dr. Moses and
[19:00] none of them could do anything about it
[19:02] and they were dying by the
[19:04] thousands. But God rich in mercy. He
[19:09] made a way of escape for those who would
[19:11] believe him. Hallelujah. He made an
[19:14] antidote for it by sending up a brass
[19:17] serpent. God and his rich God made a way
[19:20] of escape. So his believing children
[19:23] could be healed. God's interested in
[19:26] everything that's wrong, everything that
[19:29] you're anticipating, every walk of life.
[19:32] God is interested in you. You are his
[19:35] child and he's rich in mercy. He wants
[19:38] to do for you.
[19:40] The people sin later by taking this same
[19:43] thing that God had made an atonement for
[19:47] them by the brass serpent which
[19:49] represented sin already judged and they
[19:53] idolize that
[19:55] gift and that's sin again. God will not
[19:59] share his glory with nobody. Therefore,
[20:02] we can't have no two, three, four gods.
[20:04] There's only one God. He'll not share
[20:05] his glory with anything else. He's God
[20:07] alone. Hallelujah. So as the heathens
[20:11] have many gods, we have the one God and
[20:15] he will not share his glory with
[20:17] another. Neither will he let anything be
[20:20] an idol in front of him even though he
[20:22] had made an atonement for the people.
[20:24] And it was God's word. It was right. But
[20:27] when they become to idolizing that then
[20:29] they got in trouble. Now that's just the
[20:32] same thing I think has happened to our
[20:33] church ages. God sent us the message of
[20:36] Martin Luther with his message. John
[20:37] Wesley the Pentecostal message. But what
[20:40] do we do with it? The very same thing
[20:43] that they did with that brave serpent.
[20:45] We idolize it. I belong to this and I
[20:48] belong to that. You see, you belong to
[20:50] something without the sincerity that's
[20:52] connected with genuine godly worship of
[20:55] the
[20:56] word. What happened? The Bible, we're
[20:59] told in the Bible that the prophet took
[21:02] that idol and destroyed it. Amen.
[21:05] Hallelujah. Yes. What we need on the
[21:08] scene today is a prophet that will
[21:10] destroy the idol of denominations that
[21:13] thinks they're going into heaven upon
[21:16] belonging to some creed or denomination
[21:19] needs to be destroyed. Burn up, throw it
[21:22] away.
[21:24] God is full of mercy. He's rich in mercy
[21:28] in the day that when we would have all
[21:30] been in that chaos of darkness out
[21:33] there. But God rich in mercy has sent us
[21:37] the real genuine Holy Ghost with his own
[21:40] interpretation to it right here in the
[21:43] building every night. Hallelujah.
[21:46] God rich in his mercy. How wonderful we
[21:51] find him to be. Yes, sir. Now, all they
[21:55] thought they could do was to just go to
[21:58] this snake or this little uh thing that
[22:01] God had made out there had Moses to make
[22:03] and hang on a pole and they could be
[22:05] healed without any sincerity. They just
[22:06] stood and look at it and they've got to
[22:08] idolize it. And God sent a prophet along
[22:12] and destroyed it. Now, all that refused
[22:16] to look at that serpent in the
[22:19] wilderness, they perished. Now, God
[22:23] makes a way, but if you refuse to look
[22:25] at
[22:26] it, if you'll sit across the street, if
[22:29] you'll hold on to some creed and refuse
[22:32] to look straight into the
[22:34] word and see whether it's right or not,
[22:38] all that refused to look, they
[22:41] perished. And God is an everchanging
[22:45] God. And all who refuse to look
[22:49] perished. So is it today the same thing
[22:52] then the people sin later and as they've
[22:55] always did and made the idol out of out
[22:57] of it making it a get trying to get
[23:00] healing without sincerity and they
[23:02] belong to something the way we do today.
[23:05] And now we see then the difference of it
[23:08] was that God it was a good atonement a
[23:13] good sign for that time that time it was
[23:17] all right but it was just to be for that
[23:19] time for that journey that's all it will
[23:22] work for that journey and the message
[23:26] that Martin Luther brought of
[23:28] justification was all right for Luther's
[23:31] age that's as far as it went
[23:33] sanctification was fine and Wesley's
[23:35] age. That's as far as it went. Then we
[23:38] come into the Pentecostal age and the
[23:41] restoration of the gifts is a very fine
[23:44] thing. It was fine in the age, but we're
[23:46] going beyond that now. We're beyond
[23:50] that. This assures as a world, we've got
[23:52] to become beyond this thing because we
[23:56] have done the same thing with it that
[23:58] they did before. Make an idol out of it.
[24:00] I belong to this order of it. I belong
[24:02] to that order of it. God will send
[24:04] somebody that'll smash the thing and
[24:07] tear it to pieces and confirm his word,
[24:10] the full word.
[24:14] Notice, praise be to God.
[24:18] Amen.
[24:21] Now, we see that that's true. God rich
[24:24] in his mercy. Then when the prophet
[24:27] destroyed this, it left them without any
[24:30] sign of healing of an atonement because
[24:34] their idol was destroyed. But God rich
[24:38] in mercy made them another one. And what
[24:41] did he do that? It troubled water at the
[24:43] pool at the temple. And many come and
[24:46] was uh healed by stepping into this
[24:49] water. Jesus came down to this same pool
[24:52] and saw a man had been laying there for
[24:54] a number of years waiting for the
[24:57] troubling of the water. See, God rich in
[24:59] mercy. Although they idolized that
[25:02] thing, although the prophet had to tear
[25:04] it up, God made another way for them
[25:06] because he's rich in mercy. He wants
[25:07] them to be healed and he made a way for
[25:11] their healing. Now then that went on.
[25:14] The world become more sinful and more
[25:17] sinful all the time. And finally the
[25:20] world got so sinful that God could have
[25:22] destroyed it. He said in Malachi 4,
[25:24] "Unless I come and to smite the earth
[25:26] with a curse, he could have done it."
[25:29] Just a question. But then God rich in
[25:33] mercy. He sent forth a savior, Jesus
[25:37] Christ. He sent forth Jesus to be both
[25:40] savior and healer. For he said, "As
[25:43] Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the
[25:45] wilderness, so must the Son of Man be
[25:47] lifted up for the same purpose. He the
[25:51] atonement." That's what we have claim
[25:53] upon. Nothing but the atonement. What
[25:56] Jesus purchased by his blood, that's
[25:58] what we have claims upon. And the Bible
[26:00] said he was wounded for our
[26:03] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[26:06] iniquity. The chasm of our peace was
[26:08] upon him. And with his stripes we were
[26:11] healed. That's what we can claim because
[26:14] that's what the atonement that we stand
[26:16] for ordered for us. God rich in mercy.
[26:20] This was to be an eternal atonement
[26:23] because he came himself.
[26:26] God came himself in a form of sinful
[26:29] flesh to make a a a an eternal atonement
[26:35] and suffered in the flesh and made the
[26:37] atonement and returned back in the form
[26:40] of the Holy Ghost to confirm that
[26:44] atonement where no brass serpent and no
[26:47] troubles water could do it. It all
[26:49] pointed to that perfect atonement. God
[26:52] rich in his
[26:53] mercy has did this. Now today being it's
[26:58] the day that we're living in, we have
[27:01] come through these church ages and
[27:03] explained everything away from that. Our
[27:06] theologians of the day has far lost that
[27:10] side of it. They explained it all the
[27:12] way to some other day, some other age,
[27:15] some other something way back from long
[27:17] ago. And divine healing was just about
[27:20] played out. Hardly found anybody who
[27:23] would believe it. They made fun of it.
[27:26] Not no more than about 20 years ago.
[27:28] They were making fun of it. The
[27:30] Pentecostals had practically got away
[27:32] from it. They started in the early days,
[27:34] but they got away from it. Look how they
[27:36] did now. They got denominational while
[27:39] running out to make them each a creed
[27:41] and so forth. They accept instead of
[27:43] accepting light as light come in, they
[27:46] organized and made themselves creeds.
[27:48] Each one coming around making himself a
[27:51] doctrine and staying in that doctrine.
[27:52] And then they got so much took away till
[27:55] the Holy Spirit couldn't get into the
[27:57] church. They just become another idol
[28:00] like a brass serpent. It become an
[28:04] idolatry. Every fellow said, "I am
[28:06] belong to this and I belong to that." It
[28:08] was an idolatry. What a mess we were in
[28:11] at the end time. But God, rich in his
[28:15] mercy, has sent back the Holy Spirit
[28:18] upon us and vindicating his word tonight
[28:22] as he promised he would do. God promised
[28:26] he would do these things. Look what he
[28:28] did.
