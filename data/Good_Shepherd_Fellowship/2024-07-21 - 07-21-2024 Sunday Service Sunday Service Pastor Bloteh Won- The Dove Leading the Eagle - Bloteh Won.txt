uh uh he just wanted me to appreciate I was talking to brother Frank prer yesterday through text and he said happy birthday I didn't figure out why he meant happy birthday but then uh uh when I started looking up uh uh on on good sheeper Facebook then I realized many people sending happy birthday to good sheeper because of our church anniversary so uh I need to reply him back because I didn't answer I said it's not my birthday is said happy birthday I didn't I didn't get the message I was too slow and uh we had a brother pastor through yesterday Jean Kalinga a good friend of mine we met many years ago almost about 24 years ago in South Africa 20 years ago not 24 20 years ago we met in South Africa I was there with him doing some meetings and here I said we had to drive about uh 6 to 8 hours or more from Johannesburg to the Namibia border so we had good time to bound together and he was doing the driving I was doing the talking and and that was one of the time I was exposed to brother young Sons because he had a bunch of them he was playing it so I had him to make me a copy and then uh uh it became something that was really a blessing so he he actually was going over driving to Ken and there and uh uh to meet uh some of his cousins that stayed there and then uh uh uh uh but he was not able to get through to the border and I think for some reason he was not feeling kind of fulfilling nauseous or weak and and and all of that so uh he drove back and he flew out this morning he's a pastoring a little group there in bing Rouge Louisiana and uh uh he wish that he could have stopped to fellowship with us but uh I mean even at the border uh he he almost fainted so he just needed to get back home quickly and be able to check himself so uh he was able to to to he will be flying out so he's at the airport now and uh but he just wanted me to bring greetings to you and uh so uh we just we just thank the lord we just thank the Lord and again uh from uh from the depths of our heart we want to say thank you thank you to each and every one of you the little ones and uh the parents and and and everyone we want to say thank you we are very very very very grateful

Revelation chapter 5 Let's uh go to Revelation chapter 5 uh uh know who's back there Grace if you are the one back there or Emmanuel I just I just sent you people uh what I be reading from I just have just u a little thing to read from this morning uh this is what I wanted to do Beyond everything uh I just wanted to thank you and uh have this time to pray with you like this amen it's uh it was very important I didn't want to forget to do that so uh Revelation chapter 5 let's let's read Revelation chapter 5 and I will have you uh sit and then uh we will share with you what uh the little inspiration that is on our heart this morning Revelation chapter 5 let's read from verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw the strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven none in the earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the ERS said unto me weep net Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and Lord in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the hether stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth praise the Lord amen father we will ask you for blessing upon your word Lord we know your word is Anointed because Lord father holy man by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost wrote this word but father we are asking that that anointing will come upon us for speaking and for receiving Lord until tell oh god father we blend into that same anointing oh God that's what we need Lord please come and take your word break it to our hearts help us Lord to be able to share something that will encourage and edify your children in our walk together in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord I give a little background of uh of what I want to talk on if you remember uh a couple of weeks ago we spoke on the return of the do now so what I want to talk on this morning is uh is a portion of that uh of that message that we didn't get into uh we started talking about it I felt like uh the Lord kind of a blessed for what we wanted to to share and uh so I I just I just stopped right there and the Wednesday after that I thought I was going to uh uh uh continue so I I read Revelation chapter 5 if you remember we talk on the on the prayers of the Saints and uh uh I I I didn't get it together I found myself going somewhere else and leaving dwelling more on the you know the the Gathering of the prayers of the Saints uh more than what I want to go to so this morning I want to take their portion of uh Revelation chapter 5 and uh in in a type I'm trusting and believing that the Lord will be able to help us to bring it to you uh uh uh in a way that uh you will be able to understand praise the Lord amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen okay amen so we thank the Lord I'm not uh uh been able to get brother deck's amen sign but uh I might not be able to do like him to have you to say Amen but I can ask for it praise the Lord just to be able to feel your presence are we together amen so uh uh what I what I want to you know um uh uh after rededicating ourself this morning and and uh doing our our uh anniversary prayer what I want to I want to share this morning hoping that the Lord will help us now uh I I tie to this the do leading the eagle if you remember when when we spoke on the The Return of the d uh I read something from on the wings of a snow white dwarf and and there was uh uh from from a from a vision that brother brandham had and uh uh and after he explain the vision then he make that statement the dove leading the eagle but on the wings of a snow white do he he actually explained to us tried to help us to see how since he was a little boy since he was a little boy from 7 years old something happened to him that affected him and uh uh and it was it was more it was more spiritual uh in a sense uh uh he's talking about in a vision he saw a scar and then uh he was about to say something and it looks like the scar went into his mouth and started grouching his stomach so all through his ministry he suffered from this stomach problem all through his ministry he suffered from his stomach problem believing that God will be able to to deliver him he talks he talk about why he was he was in pains with his stomach he would be standing in the prayer line he's going through excruciating pain in his stomach but yet he praying for people to be healed and people are getting their result but yet he's in pain praise the Lord that's the thing that Alexander Cooper could not understand Alexander the coer SMI I mean I say Alexander Cooper oh my God Alexander the coer Smith could not understand about Paul you know why this man with this great ministry will be complaining about his eyes when de forsake Paul that was the reason why he forsook Paul because he could not understand it and and that is and that is the thing that uh uh uh we will have to deal with you there are places where you will never be able to understand why you love God but you are still struggling with certain things praise the Lord am amen instead of you struggling to understand that you have to learn to praise God that he placed that thing in your life because without that you will be more horrible than you think you are that's right praise the Lord and and uh and you see so he he brought that and uh you know and and in that vision and after explaining it then he make this statement the dove leading the eagle he he saw her mother had a dream where she saw six do and then uh uh uh then uh he went theread Colorado in the mountain and then he saw this white the Seven door Perfection and then when he saw that it it brought the vision together and he was speaking about his healing because he he came to the m Clinic here he went from Hospital doctors you know they told him you would just have to live with that the rest of your life but he was believing that God will will visit him God will give him a healing praise the Lord amen what brother Brandon received a a uh uh uh physical healing in his body or the Lord uh uh when the Lord took him home you know uh uh uh because he's preaching this message uh on the wings of a snow white door 1965 you know so whether he's going home you know the do leading the eagle home will have free him from their sickness praise the Lord I could bring more more to you in detail but that's not what I'm talking that's not what I want to preach about this morning I'm just only taking the do leading the ego uh uh uh just just to be able to to get a title and then be able to bring to you what I want to bring to you this morning praise the Lord now so what I want to bring to you like we were talking on the the the return of the dove the dove has always been used as a sign just doing some review when we spoke on there one of the emphasis that we were on when Noah sent the dove out and the dove returned back the reason why the do return back was what found no place for rest amen because it found no place for rest praise the Lord and uh uh uh and rest rest is is what all of this is all about praise the Lord when you look in the creation story Genesis chapter 1 the Bible says when God created the Heaven and Earth uh uh and and and God went through he went through all the the the creation even he went through all the creation even the Bible says on the seventh day the Lord rested praise the Lord amen amen so rest is very important to our chran in faith that's what God is doing that's what this is all about is to bring us to rest that's what the Christian faith is about it's not about church membership or church going it's about you coming to a place of rest in your life coming to a place of rest in your mind in your heart because no matter how loud we can play the music and how many hours we can sing we can run around and rejoice at the end of the day if you will have to leave church going back home to wor it and your spirit is all Disturbed praise the Lord I would say we need more of God amen amen amen we need more of God that's what the Christian faith is all about rest is God bringing you to rest rest in him yes rest believing that he has already done it it's a finished work you know one of the thing that is bothering us I salute you brother Moses how are you amen I saw you coming in I wanted you uh you were distracting me but I just have to say it God bless you good to see you good to see you amen good to see you brother and uh so uh uh uh yeah lost my TR TOS there but it's okay glory be to God and so you you will realize that one of the thing one of the thing that is troubling the Christian church is self-righteousness self-righteousness is one of our problem the reason why it is our problem is is because as as children of God we have not come to appreciate and fully understand that this is a finished work and all God want where he's bringing your faith is for you to believe do you remember in the Bible it said over and over what is impossible to man is possible to God praise the Lord amen amen amen until we come to really understand what that is praise the Lord and come to real realiz that we have lot of impossibilities around our life if you don't have impossibility you don't need God right that's right if you don't have impossibilities you don't need God right and you will never appreciate the Christian faith am he specialized in things impossible amen glory be to God am are we together so we talk about that D the DF returning back because it never found a place to rest glory to God God started his creation the first day he you know he he said let it be light and and then he I mean he did all his creation the sixth day God made a Man In His Image when God was able to achieve to have a man in His image then the seventh day he rested so see the work of God now what he's what he wanting to do is to be able to get you and myself in His image then he will rest amen hallelujah and until we come to that place to come to the image of God not the one that we have buil in our mind not the one our self-righteousness has built the one that the word of God has has described amen when we come to that image then God will rest what was the rest how did God rested he never put a bed down or put a m down to rest he rested in Adam yes that's right that's why Paul would call the Holy Ghost a rest in the book of Hebrew that's right when God can get a man that is willing to fully submit to his will then God steps in that man amen then Jesus will say I do nothing except what the father has shown me that's right you are not moving to be seen you are not doing to be recognized you wish that you are not seen let the father be seen and Jesus said man we see your good works and glorify the father yes sir Hallelujah that's right so rest is very important let me show you another another example in the scripture when the Book of Revelation talks about about hell it describ it as the buttonless pit so bottomless means you are just sinking and can never come to rest because when something is bottomless it does not have a stop it's just going it's just going you can never come to rest praise the Lord so you see the Christian faith brings you to rest it want you to rest on Christ bring you to uh h h h this Solid Ground amen where you can rest your faith on the finished work of Jesus Christ praise the Lord and the devil want to keep you in a frustrated State amen where you don't have rest you trying you you you trying to grab a straw trying to grab everything thinking if I get this it will be okay for me if I do this and you just and you just can't get rest so in prising you will see that's what uh he said hell is on earth when he saw that people coming down in JC Penny that links back to his vision what were they doing they were coming down the ES L and in his vision when he was 14 years old shot in his legs he was he was in a descending order crying to God oh God if you take me from here I will save you because he was going down you were just going down that's what bothered him and he went home because he it almost looks like he was he was he was able to see it he he caught up with his Spirit could this be on Earth praise the Lord so why God by the Holy Ghost is bringing people to rest and Trust in Christ right on earth right in this boarding there are people that just they are just in the descending order just in the descending order can never find rest even as much as they try to fake it they are not settle they are not setting as much as they try to fake it they can they can be on the stage and say all the wonderful things at the end of the day they have to get a cigarette to smoke or an alcohol to drink or to look for one other entertainment or another because they are not setting they are not settled they fall back into that state and they are just wondering where am I when will this be over how can I get out of this their spirit is in the descending order everything of life looks like a failure are we together so the dove returned the return of the dove was because it never had a place of rest so that's that's the emphasis that's what I want us to put the emphasis on the do only come because of rest so when I got an olive leaf came back gave it to Noah Noah knew that okay the water is going down and when the dove went out the second time it never returned praise the Lord do uh Noah believed that uh uh the water was dried and the Bible says God opened the ark and and went on and then I I link this connected to Matthew chapter 3 it's in John chapter 1 Jesus on the bank of Jordan while John was baptizing when Jesus came out to John John testified that he saw the spirit of God coming down in the form of a DF now so if the do will come again is because the do has found a resting place and John said I Heard a Voice saying behold my my my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased Amen to D so the door fall the resting place so my emphasis was the dove that left the ark kept flying through the Old Testament in types and shadows because the dove was used in the Old Testament for sacrifice amen praise the Lord but all the sacrifices in the Old Testament was pointing to Jesus am so the dove could not rest on those sacrifices are you getting the picture amen but when Jesus the the the the the the the antitype the Fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy was here that do now is in the type now praise the Lord amen don't get too scientific on me and say oh the do late 2,000 years 2,000 year were flying around I want you to be able to get the picture praise the Lord the do return because God is testifying my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to do now so we see there at the door of God a resting place are we together and John identify that resting place as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the word amen so the do in its nature will only rest on a ling nature are we together praise the Lord the do will only rest on a ling nature so I want us to keep the do and lamb in mind now Jesus the Lamb of God he worked throughout his ministry praise the Lord and he kept telling the the the Believers the disciples uh H H about the coming of the Holy Ghost are we together he told Nicodemus h h h uh a stbe that he had to be born again so Jesus the Lamb of God was gaed by the door in his ministry are we together I want to I want you to for us to see the picture he was gathered by the do through his ministry amen he promised the Believers that when he Ascend he will return I will not leave you comfortless praise the Lord now another thing I want for us to put into our picture from Revelation chapter 5 okay Revelation chapter 5 let's go back to Revelation chapter 5 like I said I uh all I wanted to do is just to appreciate you and uh uh for for another year of service together so I will take take uh my time this morning and just try to bring this to you as soon as you you get the picture you say Amen then we'll go home praise the Lord amen hallelujah if I'm not hearing you saying amen I know you have not got the picture yet that's okay for me I keep working keep working on it brother Andrews praise the Lord I saw in the hand of him that sat on the throne a book written with in on the backside seal with seven seal I saw an angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals no man in heaven or in Earth neither on under the Earth was able to open the book needed to look there on no man praise the Lord no man but the cry that went out when the angel proclaimed was who is worthy whoo is looking for a man it's looking for a person but no man was found worthy to open in the book and to lose the seals thereof are we together amen follow me carefully now John said he wept in verse four in verse 5 one of the others now these others were the 24 others that was around the throne are we together amen praise the Lord amen amen what I'm saying is it making sense I'm not just making a lot of stories making you more confused praise the Lord one of these others were the 24 ERS around the throne the 24 others is made out of a representation of the 12 tribes the Patriot and the 12 apostles they are the one make the 24 others am praise the Lord one of those hethers said to John we not the lion of the tribe of Judah amen has prevailed amen are you seeing the picture he says the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed when John turned turn to see the lion that has prevailed now think about it now the word Prevail means to overcome amen so John the one the other is seeing the lion of the Trap of Judah has overcome are we together but when John turned to see the lion he saw a lamb praise the Lord so let's understand a little bit the relationship of The Lion and the lamb the ELD says a lion has prevailed John turned he saw a lamb what is happening now this is what is happening because the Book of Revelation is a book of symbol praise the Lord amen so what is Happening Here is that Jesus the Lamb of God the Lamb of God led the church to Pentecost amen he ascended on High Praise the Lord so we will realize if you take the the the the the the anointing you take the four beasts that is around the throne are we together there is a lion there is an ox there's a man there is an eagle Revelation chapter 6 are we together amen now so all of these anointing they were symbolized in the Old Testament as the cherubin that were around the throne when Adam and Eve were driven from the garden the cherubin was put to guard the tree of life it was those four beasts they were there to guide the Tree of Life are we together uh uh asaiah saw it how his train filled the temple they were moving in such a speed moving in such a speed just like a train the Bible say his train filled the temple what it was is that those angels wings are lock one to another praise the Lord amen their wings are lock one to another I I think we we demonstrated a year before praise the Lord am brother Johnny come and help me Jon come and help me praise the Lord come and help me brother Peterson I think we did that year a long time ago so we will we'll do it again you stand right here stand right here please just make yourself flexible I'm not going to box I don't want to okay so you lock your hands with his hands and lock your hands with this guy hands good and uh so that's how the that's how the the cherubin are okay they are luck so when they are moving because they are in uh H uh Angelic creatures they move so fast so when Isaiah saw it he saw it like a train when Ezekiel Saw saw it it was like the wheels in the middle of the wheels but it was the it was the cherubin that were moving are we together amen and when they move they move together if brother Johnny move brother Johnny you go they all move like this so they they are moving with the face of a man so the the the rest of the cherubin the the the their support is behind it they are not going in in a divisive way I'll give you an example if God just like uh uh uh uh the first three Church Ages were under the anointing of the Lion the lion has prevailed pay attention now praise the Lord amen because I'm saying all of this not to just not to give you a h h you know perform a drama but to make you to understand what I'm trying to say where I'm trying to bring you John said the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed but when John looked he saw the lamb praise the Lord so John the identify one of the creature because they don't move spray out they move in the face of one amen right praise the Lord amen the ELD who have also said the ox has prevailed amen praise the Lord amen if it was the face of the ox the the Ed would say the ox has prevailed if it was the face of the man man the ELD could say the man has prevailed are you getting the picture if it was the face of the ego the Ed who says the ego has prevailed because that's how they move praise the Lord amen are we together lion will represent Faith the four anointings on the healing Lon represent our faith amen because Faith Like brother Bram says is an action where it has hair on his chest it's you know you step out by faith amen the ox represent sacrifice so whenever the church is going on a a sacrificial time that that is Tye with our trials God put an ox anointing on you for you to Bear your trials that's the reason why no trial come upon us that is greater amen thank you Lord that before God gave you a trial he has already anointed you with an ox for you to Bear it amen are we together amen so H uh wisdom knowledge is under the man's anointing are we together are are you seeing the picture Okay so uh uh the a saw like I said they are not spread out no they are not spread out they are they are moved together and their and and their wings are all locked together like this and uh the church is right in the middle amen amen praise the Lord Jesus said I be my church the gifts of Hell will not [Applause] previl the devil can't gu to God's Church you might think he's getting to you because you are in trial no he's only hitting the ox anointing and that anointing is protecting [Applause] you that's the reason why Let the church get away from her self-righteousness stop to think that you are the one doing it you're not doing anything are you getting the picture amen the church has already been predestinated it can never fail amen amen you might feel backslide it does not mean that the church has failed the church can never fail the church is going to arrive that's the reason why God can present to himself a church without spot or blamage why because he has already provided a protection for his church the church is lacking this yes reason why it pays for you to understand what God is doing to your life what is he doing to your life what season are you in where God want to bring you we love to be in control when we can't control nothing are we together are you seeing the picture the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed but when John turned around to see a lion he saw a lamb praise the Lord now because these are the anointing that is given to God the church amen but there is a nature the ano anting is different from the nature the lamb will only come the dove will only come on a l nature praise the Lord that's the reason why a man can have an anointing preach and bring fire down from heaven if he don't have a ling nature he will see like the devil praise the Lord amen they either identify an anointing when Jon look around he saw a nature amen what did the Ed said the lion has prevailed the lion has over come was it a lion that went to Calvary what went to Calvary larm praise the Lord amen so it's a ling nature in the lion that prevail [Music] amen am the anointing and the nature amen you can sing like a sparkle bird and put Goose bomb on people if the nature is not changed you would drink sin like a drunker are you getting the pict are you are you getting the picture who is worthy they were looking for a man but yet no man was found walking because no man had that Ling nature since Adam fell all through we all only SE shap in iniquity came to the word speaking lies are we together are you seeing the picture amen amen okay so we will I would I would work with the brothers here and then I let them go and sit okay let's let's dramatize a little bit so we take brother Johnny as uh as the as the lion so when when the lion and anointing move the entire chuban goes behind it and support it okay no let's let's stay right here or else we won't have space to move let's let's come back and then I I I will I will be the I will be the the the the ox anointing when I move all the cherubin move so so everything you will see is just the ox that's the reason why on the Dark Age that was the anointing that was on the church okay the people could give their life to be burned they could be sacrificed the church was under the ano they could they were not struggling they were not struggling to submit them themselves because that's the anointing that was on the church the ones that were struggling were the ones that did not have the Ling nature because no matter how much anointing is there if the nature is not changed you will run away are we together amen okay if brother if brother Emmanuel moveed that that would be the man's anointing so the entire church is honor that anointing amen that's under that anointing the reformer a John Wesley Martin lther and all of these Great Men you know they were they were looking into God's word they were bringing truth out of the word of God the church was honor that praise the Lord but no matter how much truth that was brought out if the people did not have the lamb nature the anointing is just for a season it's just for a season you will shout run around and all of that it's just for a season the Nature has to be changed are we together Amen brother J Jonathon will be on the the eagles's anointing so when he moves the church is the entire church because the church is right here the church is kept in the middle so all all the the the the the working seed is that it's not split anointing no they are not fighting against one another there's no competition God bless you Brothers thank you [Applause] amen are you seeing the picture now many people take the EV events of the seals that's another thing I can spend time and and and explain that to you Revelation chapter 6 uh six uh uh the first horse rider the second horse rider they take that to be the seals it's not the seals right it's the event it's the thing that happened around the seals the seal is one thing Christ amen what what were the angel say who is worthy to open the book and to do what loose the seals release the Life of Christ that's what the loosing of the seal is all about is to release the Life of Christ are we together that's what is all about that's what the seal is all about it's not all about this explanation the first horse rather the the the dark Ag and and and all of this drama those are just information on the seals yes sir the actual seals is the release of the Life of Christ that comes back on the believer since the Old Testament sacrifice of of Boo and gods when the when the when the animal was killed the life could not come back on the believer for the believer to be able to experience the Life of Christ it had to take the opening of the seals yes sir that's what the breaking of the seals is all about it's not to give us information to be condemning one person no no no no it's for the Life of Christ to come back on the believer once again we can see truth earnesty it's not about you protecting what do you have to protect it by yourself right to be Earnest is to be Earnest examine your your earnesty with the word of God not you protecting yourself are we together now so if if the picture is built if the picture is built oh glory be to God Amen amen if the picture is built and and and we are together are we together amen let me read something here from uh uh uh Revelation chapter 4 that will help you yeah Revelation chapter 4 Series if uh if my girls back there can pull that up for me it would just it would just help you to get a picture of what what I was trying to bring to you uh in the drama here uh what's the year what is it it means that this guy this guy was God's Ark which mean the four Beast they were God's Ark the eagle the ox the man and the lion Matthew Mark Luke and John if you even look in the four gospel you will see it Matthew speaks about the king that's the lion mark his gospel was all about service that's the ARs Luke was a doctor a physician he was a man he wrote book book The Book of Luke and and the book of Acts if God did not give a man that was that were at the level of Luke we will not have a report of the book of Acts Luke was the one that wrote it John John came and said in the beginning was the word the word was he went right back to the beginning that was the eag's anointing right so it's the four God is the four Beast is the four living creature we can say it in in in in different ways just to be able to bring the picture out Hallelujah now watch this also watch this Adam has fell amen amen amen king killed Abel before God called Noah are we together amen so which mean death has already come on the earth so man was no longer honor the perfect condition that Adam and Eve were honor praise the Lord but here it said that God called Noah and gave him a message and when Noah sent for his message his message was able to get those animals in their falling State Amen to come into an ark and as they enter the ark there was sufficient anointing there was sufficient atmosphere to affect them that all their forces e one another running away from one another could not enter the ark as they came climbing that step and entering into the ark for the fact there is that their nature was changed from the very fact that they could hear Noah message right their nature was not changed in the ACT if now they will start eating one another on the road when they heard the message Faith come back by hearing praise the lord we need some hearing that will change our nature if our nature is not Chang we are not hearing enough right right praise the Lord amen when they heard the message to be able to turn and look for where Noah was something struck them their nature was changed right and those animals would come uh uh uh in peirs and and and the other ones in servant to come right into the ark and they will stay in that AR all of those days no fussing praise the Lord the beautiful thing there is that nobody asking for special diet praise the Lord nobody asking for special diet there are some people that in church they let to be treated special they want special attention Noah did not have no special diet praise the Lord what was good for one was good for [Music] [Applause] all are we together am praise the Lord hallelujah amen oh oh my amen are we together amen glory be to God the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed why because that's what they were seeing that's what the Ed saw he saw a lion anointing that brought the church through the first three ages the first three Church Ages were under the Lion's anointing that's the reason why they could reach out and spread the gospel they were traveling trying to conquer the word under the Lion's anointing under the fourth age it was under the ox anointing that was when great darkness and persecution was on the church and men were willing to give their lives amen they were willing to give their life praise the lord we have a church age that is that wanting to get this age that's laoda Spirit we can't help it it's the spirit of our age it just want to get it don't know how to give this age don't know how to give we in so much competition that even if we can get all we get nobody can see us we are covered with it we still be there s me one more they can't even see you that's your age age of getting are we together now so it's it's the it's a revelation series that I want to bring to you is a Revelation 5 picture I want to bring to you in this way to show you that there is a Ministry and there is a nature and that's where the church has fail people run for the ministry they run for the anointing right without the nature right praise the Lord amen the an the the anointing can wear off that's true praise the Lord the nature comes to change you if you just want the anointing oh I want the Holy Ghost you can feel the sensation you can shout jum when you wear out we see you foring right am it's two different things it's two different things when you get the nature because when the nature comes when the Ling nature comes it kills you it kills you so much that you get afraid of the anointing you know you are not sure whether you really want it because you are dead right amen that's the problem with the church people run out for gifts they want gifts they want anointing but the Life of Christ the nature of the Lamb the dove cannot come on the lion the lion will eat it the dove cannot lead a lion the lion in its nature will eat it for the do to lead the lion the lion must have a lamby nature that's why Revelation 5 was showing to us there was an anointing there but the nature of Christ was the driving force of the church John looked to see a lion he saw a lamb bleeding lamb that's what the Bible says a bleeding lamb amen amen are we together because the dove can only rest on the lamb the door will not even come on the ox even though the ox is a sacrificial animal the dove will not come on the ox until the ox has a lamin nature amen the dove will not come on a man until that man or woman have a ling nature the do cannot Le ego until the ego has a lamin nature why because the ego in this build or can fly more higher than the DF why will it submit itself to the DF why why will it submit itself to the do unless the nature is changed am it has a eagle body but the nature in it is a it's a lamb praise the Lord it will never fly Beyond the do it will always stay under the leadership of the do even though the wings is big but it will say no you are my leader I'm going to stay right under you I can't fly more than you praise the Lord but if the ego nature does not changed when it y one time the door will run are we together amen praise the Lord amen has the church seen the picture is the picture clear praise the Lord you have to be able to identify the anointing the anointing has a nature the five4 ministry they are all under the nature of this Beast the the the Evangelist he's there you know what just like lion the pastor he's the he's the Belling Bearer he's the sacrificial animal of the team yes praise the Lord so they are all under this anointing that is given to lead the church but what is important what is important is the Ling nature if a man don't have a lme in nature you make a mess of this anointing yes sir you will you will explain explain and talk and talk and talk at the end of Faith you will not be able to submit yourself to the very word that you claim to believe that has been the problem of the Christian Church yes sir anointed one at the end time why would Jesus say depart from me the worker of iniquity amen I never knew you why because they never had his nature right amen he can't deny his own are we together are you seeing the picture you see so I think what what what Good Shepherd needs amen am it's not powerful preacher though no we don't need powerful preacher no I'm not trying to make excuse to say because I'm not powerful y please keep me that's not what I'm doing praise the Lord I I've always told you if you find another good one I will still right here and support him you just let me know glory be to Goden amen well I'm I'm just teasing you a little bit but to be able to to to to help you to understand what what uh what a church need what a church need it's a laming nature if we all can submit to the word and learn to submit to one another your gift can never be a benefit to this church or to any church if you are not ready to submit if you are not ready to submit to the word of God your gift can never be a benefit not even to yourself because out of arrogance and ignorance and you will destroy yourself am amen are we together amen I could go on and on I believe I've I've got I've got the picture out I believe that uh you have seen where I'm going this morning amen amen no man is walting but the Lamb of God was a man amen the Lamb of God was a man but yet it said no man was Wy to take the book to lose the seals to even look upon it so what was God looking for what what was he looking for that no man in the heavens the Earth beneath the Earth praise the Lord amen that's how much the fall in the beginning how much sin has def defied the the the human nature sin has defied the human nature right whether you are born in holy wellock your parents were in the church from the day they were born you were born in the church born in the message whatever whatever Lang you can use for yourself we are all polluted defied by the sinful nature and no man is worthy until that ly nature comes in until that L Nature comes in when men are ready to submit to the word of God above our better judgment you calling the word of God into question will your character come on now will your character born of a woman born in sin then you bringing God's word into question with your character amen praise the Lord amen that was one of the thing when you read the book of job that was one of the thing that job never did job held his Integrity but he had a fine line to know that God was more righteous the man that's right that's right amen that's right he held his Integrity he says I know I'm not a sinner I have tried to do my best but the almighty is more righteous than man and I can never bring him into question praise the Lord I can never bring him into question oh praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning this afternoon glory be to God Amen Hallelujah who is wanting to open the book take the seals loose the seals thereof if God don't help us we will die in our sin die in our self-righteousness we need the help of God Amen if we can just be like Paul that great messenger yet he could have the knowledge the the the language to say oh Wretched Man I am who will deliver me from this death Paul never said that when he was an unbeliever he was a Believer he was a messenger of the age right but he still saw himself as a Wretched Man that needed God love the Lord praise the Lord oh may God may God help us may he come to our rescue amen may God come to our rescue may God come to our rescue oh praise the Lord hallelujah man oh man I read I read to you here um couple of weeks ago there from from uh question brother man says what God struggle with is to get a man is to get a man that he can take from a humble beginning and that man will remain humble right he says as soon as God begin to bless a man he starts to step out of that place right says God want a man that will remain humble look through all the scripture you see there see it in David see it in Moses man that can remain humble it's not it's not all about carrying ourself wretched and I mean you'll just be lying to yourself you know I mean you you decide to to I mean to dress carelessly just to show you are humble you just lying to yourself praise the Lord the humbleness God is looking for this a man that can humble himself to the word yes sir that's right praise the Lord that can humble himself to the word when the word speaks all our argument is done amen HJ praise the Lord he says Amen to that well the Lord bless you the Lord bless you want to go into another session of this but we keep it for another time what I really wanted to bring out was this place in Revelation chapter 5 to show the nature that is needed for the dove to come on so when the prophet said the do leads the eagle many men has buil Ministry around it they thought that they were the dove to lead the ego that is the prophet but if you look in Revelation chapter 5 you will see what he mean because the dove can only leave the lme in nature so how will the dop Le the ego until the ego has a ling nature amen until the ego has a ling nature and uh uh and he was says I want the dove to fly into my heart Bring me God's Sweet Love on the wings of a snow white dove the Holy Spirit bring it to me tonight Lord and drop into my heart the faith that I have need of Amen so I mean that's where we are in our walk with God in our walk with God God has already set here the scene is set you can look at every Old Testament character if we want to run through it we can be able to tell which anointing was on whether it was a lion whether it was a ox whether it was a man why would God call Nebuchadnezzar my seven he said nebz my seven brother Del just preach here on Wednesday night a purpose for God purpose of God and a purpose for God God raised of pharaoh amen he was under the man's anointing a stubborn one too but you see at the end of it God destroy him the same thing with nebz he was under the man's anointing and he start to break all of these things I have done about God destroy him for that why because they never had the nature yes to be able to realize that it is not me it's Christ that live in me you can run it all through all through the scripture you can run it and if we would get anywhere with God we must begin with the lamb nature praise the lord we must begin with the lme nature it's a beast of sacrifice is surrounder is is Right amen praise the Lord it surrounder is well to the word it has to be to the word so the
