[48:44] Revelation chapter
[48:46] 4 verse one again that's where we read
[48:50] from and uh if we don't spend much time
[48:54] preaching tonight we will we bring
[48:56] praise at the end of the
[49:00] service praise the Lord
[49:10] amen once again we greet you all in the
[49:13] name of the Lord Jesus Revelation
[49:14] chapter 4 verse
[49:22] one Revelation CH 4 verse1 we read from
[49:26] year on Sunday we want to come back and
[49:29] uh uh really didn't have the the
[49:33] opportunity to to preach what was on our
[49:35] heart but we preach in a way amen and I
[49:38] hope that it was a blessing to you
[49:39] praise the Lord
[49:43] amen after this I
[49:46] look and behold a door was open in
[49:51] heaven and the first voice I heard which
[49:55] I heard was as it word of a trumpet
[50:00] talking with
[50:01] me which said come up hither and I will
[50:07] show thee things which must be Hereafter
[50:11] the Lord bless you you can have your
[50:13] seat praise the
[50:15] Lord
[50:17] amen love the Lord tonight praise the
[50:21] Lord
[50:24] amen Luke chapter 1
[50:27] Luke chapter 1 if you want to look there
[50:29] with me tonight there's something that
[50:33] uh uh that we all know but I was just
[50:37] looking at it some sometime last week
[50:41] and uh I just want us to just uh share
[50:45] that with you Luke chapter
[50:48] 1 there are some few things that I saw
[50:50] in Luke chapter one and
[50:54] uh uh now to take much of the time you
[50:58] know the story let's look at verse 15
[51:01] Luke chap 1 verse
[51:03] 15 if we go back a little bit in verse
[51:07] 13 it will it will help us to to be able
[51:10] to catch up in t year and the angel said
[51:13] unto him that's the angel Gabriel
[51:15] speaking to Zacharias fear not Zacharias
[51:18] for thy prayer is heard and thy wife
[51:22] Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou
[51:26] shall call his name
[51:30] John and thou shall have joy and
[51:34] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[51:39] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[51:44] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[51:48] nor strong drink and he
[51:52] said oh I think um
[51:57] um uh
[51:59] okay and and he shall be filled with the
[52:02] Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb
[52:04] that's that's completely off of word I
[52:07] wanted to read but Verse 18 let's drop
[52:09] down to verse 18 verse 18 is where uh
[52:12] wanted to grab your attention tonight
[52:14] and Zachariah said unto the angel
[52:17] whereby shall I know
[52:20] this for I am an old man and my wife
[52:26] well stricken in years praise the Lord
[52:29] the angel have just announced the birth
[52:32] of John the Baptist praise the Lord and
[52:37] Zacharias is asking whereby shall I know
[52:40] this now this is an Earnest question
[52:43] Let's uh let's let's let's go down in
[52:46] the same
[52:48] uh
[52:52] uh let's go down in the same chapter 1
[52:55] verse 30
[52:58] the same angel that spoke to Jo to
[53:01] Zacharias is now speaking to Mary verse
[53:03] 30 and the angel said unto her the angel
[53:07] Gabriel said unto Mary fear not Mery for
[53:11] thou H found favor with God and behold
[53:15] thou shall conceive in the womb and
[53:18] bring forth a son and shall call his
[53:22] name
[53:23] Jesus praise the Lord verse
[53:30] 34 and then said Mary unto the angel how
[53:35] shall this be seeing I know not a man
[53:41] praise the Lord
[53:44] Zacharias is questioning the angel Mary
[53:47] is questioning the angel praise the
[53:50] Lord is that right is that how you
[53:53] understand
[53:54] it whereby shall I know this that's what
[53:58] Zachariah said and Mary said how shall
[54:01] this be is that not pretty much the same
[54:07] question
[54:09] Amen in all fairness is that not the
[54:13] same
[54:15] question praise the
[54:18] Lord but why did they anger
[54:26] turned
[54:27] zachariah's uh took zachariah's speech
[54:31] that he couldn't
[54:34] speak and the angel answer Mary her
[54:39] question now what I want to bring you to
[54:43] tonight is to get you from all your
[54:48] theological answers that you know what I
[54:51] want to bring you to tonight is to help
[54:55] us to see
[55:00] is only
[55:03] God that has the skill to
[55:08] weigh our
[55:11] earnesty praise the
[55:13] Lord every man in their own eyes and in
[55:16] their own ways are
[55:19] earnest praise the
[55:21] Lord when we do things that we do we try
[55:24] to do it to the best of of our earnesty
[55:28] and our
[55:29] sincerity but it is only God that weigh
[55:32] the
[55:33] spirit of an Earnest
[55:36] heart and it's only God also that knows
[55:42] when you are doubting
[55:47] him no matter how
[55:49] much we think we have faith no matter
[55:53] how much we think we believe whatever we
[55:59] believe is only
[56:01] God that knows when you are doubting
[56:08] him praise the
[56:11] Lord do you see where I'm going tonight
[56:14] because I mean we can we can get in the
[56:15] scripture oh Zachariah had a lot of
[56:18] examples we can go that route but that's
[56:20] not where I'm going
[56:22] tonight where I'm going tonight is to
[56:25] help us to
[56:27] see that as the heaven is higher than
[56:30] the earth asai said there so are God
[56:35] thoughts higher than our thoughts so are
[56:39] his ways higher than our ways the way
[56:42] God look at issue completely different
[56:45] from the way we look at
[56:51] issue praise the Lord and he's the
[56:54] Supreme judge
[57:01] when you when you look at it actually
[57:04] you realize that just like I said that's
[57:06] an Earnest question that Zachariah
[57:10] asks praise the
[57:14] Lord but God
[57:16] determined that even though his question
[57:19] was
[57:21] Earnest but God could pick up in his
[57:24] spirit
[57:30] that he was doubting and he was fearful
[57:32] because what did the angel said fear
[57:34] not amen the angel sensed the spirit of
[57:38] fear and said fear
[57:43] not praise the Lord but even more than
[57:47] that that's the same thing the angel
[57:49] said to Mary fear
[57:51] that I believe because uh the presence
[57:55] of the Angel is uh is uh uh is awesome
[58:00] okay terrifying let me if if if that's
[58:03] the right word to
[58:05] say uh it's it's overwhelming praise the
[58:09] Lord but if you if you look at that you
[58:13] know we can we can look at mared and
[58:16] says uh you know uh uh
[58:21] uh what she was going to be experienced
[58:24] has never been experienced before
[58:28] praise the Lord it has never been
[58:29] experienced for the young woman to to to
[58:33] be conceived without knowing a
[58:36] man what Zacharias have experienced has
[58:39] been experienced
[58:42] before praise the Lord so in one sense
[58:45] it gave us an idea that when when when
[58:50] God judge our earnesty or he looks at
[58:54] our fears he looks at our doubt it it
[58:57] makes us to see that he's looking
[59:00] through the eye of his
[59:02] word he's looking through the eye of his
[59:05] word are you looking at his word are you
[59:08] looking at his promises or you are
[59:11] looking at your
[59:15] condition because Zacharias had lot of
[59:19] example that God has done in his
[59:23] word he was not in the days of Abraham
[59:26] but he had a Torah that recorded Abraham
[59:29] that recorded Rebecca that recalled
[59:32] Rachel and all of those people Hanah all
[59:35] of those things zachariah's uh uh had he
[59:38] he had a record of those
[59:41] things are you seeing where I'm going
[59:44] tonight praise the
[59:47] Lord our questions sometimes are earnest
[59:53] questions but where are we looking
[59:58] where are we drawing our questions
[1:00:02] from it said from the
[1:00:04] media it say from the pressure of
[1:00:08] society it say even from the pressure of
[1:00:11] our sinful
[1:00:17] nature that we asking God oh God when
[1:00:21] Lord when when will you bless me Lord
[1:00:23] when will you do where are we drawing
[1:00:29] praise the
[1:00:33] Lord but again we have to realize that
[1:00:37] uh it's God just like Hanah said you
[1:00:41] know you go and read Hanah prophecy that
[1:00:44] in 1 Samuel she said God Waits The
[1:00:47] Spirit of
[1:00:48] man is God that weigh the spirit of
[1:00:52] man we can cry to God we can
[1:00:56] you know but he knows the intents of our
[1:01:01] heart praise the Lord he knows where you
[1:01:05] are drawing from the question on your
[1:01:08] mind where are you drawing it
[1:01:10] from your
[1:01:14] fears your doubt he knows where you are
[1:01:16] drawing it
[1:01:19] from right from the scripture yeah we
[1:01:21] can see
[1:01:23] that uh uh Zachariah question was from
[1:01:27] his age he look at his age praise the
[1:01:30] Lord you look at his wife
[1:01:39] condition are we together so I mean we
[1:01:43] just we just came out of a uh uh a
[1:01:46] little prayer meeting tonight so I just
[1:01:48] thought to encourage you uh when we pray
[1:01:52] it is not all about what we say to God
[1:01:56] but where are we drawing our thoughts
[1:01:58] from what is influencing our burden they
[1:02:01] say
[1:02:04] fear are we counting God able you see
[1:02:08] because it is some of those things that
[1:02:10] Inspire us to say the things that you
[1:02:13] say before God is where you are
[1:02:20] drawing where your mind is are you
[1:02:23] looking through the promise you know
[1:02:24] brother BR says you know we must apply
[1:02:27] the token with our prayer what does that
[1:02:29] mean bring your prayer through the
[1:02:32] word Place God's worthy for
[1:02:36] him Lord this is your promise this is
[1:02:39] what you
[1:02:40] said I believe
[1:02:42] it but I'm waiting for you to bring it
[1:02:45] to pass in my
[1:02:50] life and you could ask God that same
[1:02:53] question but your mind could be
[1:02:55] challenging
[1:02:56] God are you Lord are you able to keep
[1:02:59] your
[1:03:02] word are you seeing what I'm going with
[1:03:04] it with
[1:03:05] it Lord your word ISS this your lord
[1:03:08] your word say that this is why your word
[1:03:10] ISS but your actual thought behind that
[1:03:13] you are asking God can you keep your
[1:03:17] word and in that way is doubt it's fear
[1:03:21] you are limiting God
[1:03:27] and there are there are hundreds of
[1:03:29] example in the world where God has kept
[1:03:31] his
[1:03:35] promise but yet you could be saying the
[1:03:37] same thing to God believing that H uh
[1:03:41] like like like the book of Hebrews said
[1:03:43] Paul said uh uh uh uh counting God
[1:03:49] able you are counting God
[1:03:53] able that he's able to will keep his
[1:03:56] word no matter what I'm going through no
[1:03:59] matter what my struggle is your word is
[1:04:01] truth if there's a problem is not your
[1:04:04] word it's
[1:04:08] me praise the Lord if there is a problem
[1:04:11] is not your word at all it's not what is
[1:04:14] written in the Bible it's not what the
[1:04:16] prophet said in the message it is
[1:04:23] me are we together
[1:04:28] praise the
[1:04:30] Lord there's a whole lot we could bring
[1:04:32] out of uh Luke chapter 1 but I'll keep
[1:04:35] it for the another
[1:04:37] day praise the Lord I'll keep it for the
[1:04:40] another day I just wanted to stir up
[1:04:42] your faith tonight you know encourage
[1:04:44] you a little bit you know there when we
[1:04:46] come come to pray is it's not just the
[1:04:48] multitudes of words that we say before
[1:04:51] the Lord but we got to get our hearts
[1:04:54] right that is the most important thing
[1:04:57] you got to get your heart
[1:05:00] right you got to get your thoughts
[1:05:08] right praise the Lord you see because
[1:05:11] clearly before we even ask he knows what
[1:05:14] we want to ask for so what is he
[1:05:16] watching for the right
[1:05:20] attitude he's watching for the right
[1:05:23] attitude
[1:05:29] praise the Lord are we
[1:05:32] together okay so we we studied a little
[1:05:35] bit from Revelation chapter 4 on
[1:05:38] Sunday and that's where we read our our
[1:05:42] Opening Our uh scripture
[1:05:46] tonight and uh uh just like I said uh
[1:05:52] you know I'm I'm I'm not a I'm not a
[1:05:55] teacher and I I don't want to go I
[1:05:58] always try not to go in the way of
[1:06:00] teaching because whenever you go by the
[1:06:03] way of teaching you bring too much
[1:06:06] information amen that's what teaching
[1:06:08] does you give people
[1:06:11] information but you see it is it's
[1:06:13] completely different when you are
[1:06:15] training
[1:06:17] people you train them to apply the
[1:06:19] information that is that they
[1:06:22] have amen and that's what adoption is
[1:06:25] order about is is the tutor the Holy
[1:06:27] Ghost training us to put the word into
[1:06:32] action praise the Lord to put the word
[1:06:35] into action so uh uh Sunday we were
[1:06:38] talking on uh Revelation chapter
[1:06:41] 4 uh after this and we identified that
[1:06:45] that uh uh that was uh after the church
[1:06:48] ages amen John speak and says after this
[1:06:53] after the church ages
[1:06:55] and uh uh there was a door open in
[1:06:59] heaven which of course we tried to to
[1:07:03] help us to see through the word that uh
[1:07:07] it was not a physical door even though
[1:07:10] it was a vision that John was in but uh
[1:07:15] uh that door that was open was a further
[1:07:19] Revelation because at the end of the
[1:07:21] verse he says I will show thee things
[1:07:25] which must be
[1:07:28] Hereafter you see that so it is it was a
[1:07:32] further Revelation the door that was
[1:07:34] open was a further Revelation John was
[1:07:37] going to get further Revelation and the
[1:07:41] further Revelation was going to be about
[1:07:43] who
[1:07:45] Jesus because the book is the revelation
[1:07:48] of Jesus
[1:07:49] Christ are we together amen now when you
[1:07:53] when you when you when you begin to see
[1:07:55] it like that you will you will you will

[1:08:01] will understand why the trumpet
[1:08:04] everything go back to
[1:08:07] Jesus praise the Lord you will
[1:08:10] understand why uh uh uh the the the red
[1:08:15] dragon in Revelation chapter 12 wanted
[1:08:18] to to uh uh destroy the child because
[1:08:22] what is that is the enemy coming against
[1:08:24] the revelation of Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ praise the
[1:08:35] Lord so if you see there and a a it help

[1:09:41] paper have you noticed
[1:09:44] that yes they always go to the bus
[1:09:47] office with a pen and
[1:09:50] paper why because they are expecting
[1:09:54] either uh uh assignment or they are
[1:09:59] expecting uh uh uh uh no matter what no
[1:10:02] matter what the conversation is they are
[1:10:04] always on expectation to be able
[1:10:11] to to not leave their place and forget
[1:10:15] about what was
[1:10:18] said praise the Lord
[1:10:22] amen and uh uh you know as we as we
[1:10:26] gravitate towards the the the technology
[1:10:30] age you know uh it it is it tails on
[1:10:34] every one of us you know it tells on
[1:10:37] every one of us why because it's easy a
[1:10:39] person can say well the service is
[1:10:41] online I I I'll wash it again I can was
[1:10:44] it 20
[1:10:45] times praise the Lord but you see the
[1:10:48] thing there is there the uh you should
[1:10:51] realize that you are coming in the
[1:10:53] presence of the bus amen he's the king
[1:10:55] of kings and while the preacher could be
[1:10:58] saying something and not not uh even
[1:11:01] knowing how the bus is speaking to you
[1:11:04] he could give you a direct instruction
[1:11:07] or he could speak something to your
[1:11:11] heart that maybe you go back and listen
[1:11:13] to the service 20 times you might not
[1:11:15] pick it up
[1:11:18] again praise the
[1:11:20] Lord and uh uh uh I mean even even uh uh
[1:11:24] let me just say this I get into my into
[1:11:27] my even sometimes you know you you
[1:11:30] realize that people that that you know
[1:11:33] that have they have grown in their
[1:11:35] prayer life they always go to pray with
[1:11:38] a with a paper either they carry it a
[1:11:42] list something they want to say to the
[1:11:44] Lord
[1:11:48] or they expect that he will say
[1:11:50] something to
[1:11:52] them praise the Lord
[1:11:59] amen and when they are praying and and
[1:12:02] and God bless them with a
[1:12:04] thought they don't feel embarrassed to
[1:12:07] to write it down and go right back into
[1:12:11] pray many times people that have not
[1:12:13] grown in their prayer life see there to
[1:12:16] be very
[1:12:18] troubling I'm in the spirit now you know
[1:12:21] they are in the spirit they don't want
[1:12:22] to cut the spirit because they are
[1:12:24] feeling it oh you know they are getting
[1:12:26] ginger in
[1:12:27] prayer but sometimes the Lord is
[1:12:30] speaking to them and then when you come
[1:12:33] from out of that you can't remember what
[1:12:35] it was oh I was thinking about something
[1:12:37] oh man something was beautiful on my
[1:12:39] mind and you just can't remember well
[1:12:42] okay that's just a side
[1:12:44] note that's just a side note but we we
[1:12:48] we say here that the open door Jesus in
[1:12:51] St John chapter 10 identify himself he
[1:12:53] says I am the door amen he says I am the
[1:12:57] door so the open door is uh is is a
[1:13:01] further revelation of Jesus and and we
[1:13:04] we quote this to you all the time there
[1:13:06] from the fourth seal if if we want to we
[1:13:09] just want to read that again so you can
[1:13:11] just underline that uh uh you know what
[1:13:15] this is from the four seal we we have
[1:13:17] read this to you before if God speaks
[1:13:19] and send you he back up what you say
[1:13:24] Amen amen see notice if you if you are
[1:13:30] an ambassador from Heaven All Heaven
[1:13:35] behind you and Heaven is consisted of
[1:13:40] the word
[1:13:44] amen Psalm said his word is settled in
[1:13:50] heaven praise the Lord his word is
[1:13:53] settled in heaven
[1:13:56] so uh the the the open door is a further
[1:14:02] revelation of Jesus Christ that will go
[1:14:05] back to the
[1:14:06] word there would there will not be any
[1:14:10] revelation of Jesus Christ there will
[1:14:12] there is there there should not be any
[1:14:14] Revelation that cannot go back to this
[1:14:19] word are we together praise the
[1:14:23] Lord you know we can we can come up with
[1:14:26] all of these beautiful things but if we
[1:14:28] cannot bring it back to the
[1:14:30] word you are standing on sinking sin God
[1:14:33] is not going to back that there is no
[1:14:35] Authority behind it it might sound
[1:14:37] wonderful it might sound fascinating wow
[1:14:40] wow but there is no Authority behind
[1:14:45] it praise the Lord so now this is this
[1:14:50] is what I want to I want to I want to
[1:14:52] dwell on tonight with a few meanings
[1:14:54] that is before for
[1:14:56] me uh pagamos Church
[1:14:59] age and like I said we are we are just
[1:15:02] are just going back and and uh

[1:15:14] see this I want for you to see this look
[1:15:17] carefully now I want for you to see
[1:15:20] this praise the Lord let's read together
[1:15:23] yeah in the
[1:15:27] words he which have the
[1:15:32] sharp swrl with two Edge lies another
[1:15:39] revelation of
[1:15:41] godhead praise the
[1:15:44] Lord are we
[1:15:46] together
[1:15:51] amen I'm I'm trying to to uh bring this
[1:15:55] in the way so you can see it in these
[1:15:59] words he which have the the Shar SWR
[1:16:02] with two Edge last another revelation of
[1:16:05] the godhead in the Ephesian age you will
[1:16:10] recall he was set forth as their
[1:16:15] unchanging God are we together amen so
[1:16:20] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:16:23] Ephesian Church age
[1:16:26] the way he revealed himself to that
[1:16:28] church age was their unchanging
[1:16:33] God Revelation Chapter 2 let's go
[1:16:38] there Revelation Chapter 2 let's go
[1:16:44] there maybe after we go around we go
[1:16:47] around the Lord will bless us then we'll
[1:16:48] just do a study on the Book of
[1:16:50] Revelation okay because it looks like
[1:16:54] I'm not getting away from it but uh I'm
[1:16:56] trying now to make it one but we are
[1:16:58] still there praise the Lord are we
[1:17:01] together now uh Revelation chap 2 verse1
[1:17:04] unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus
[1:17:07] write these things say he that holdeth
[1:17:10] the Seven
[1:17:12] Stars in his right hand who walketh in
[1:17:16] the midst of the seven golden
[1:17:19] Candlestick now this is Jesus
[1:17:22] identifying himself to the Ephesian
[1:17:25] Church age he identified himself as the
[1:17:28] one that holds the Seven Stars in his
[1:17:31] hands praise the
[1:17:33] Lord who walth in the midst of the seven
[1:17:36] golden Candlestick the seventh star is
[1:17:39] the seven messenger of the seven Church
[1:17:41] ages amen are we together the seven
[1:17:45] golden Candlestick is the seven Church
[1:17:48] ages are we together now so if you go
[1:17:53] back to what we have just read from the
[1:17:55] pagamos church age he identified himself
[1:17:59] in that church age as the unchanging God
[1:18:02] meaning that the same way he was that
[1:18:05] that the same way he was experienced in
[1:18:08] the the the first church age he will be
[1:18:11] experienced in the seven Church ages the
[1:18:15] same why because he's holding the Seven
[1:18:19] Stars and he's holding the seven
[1:18:22] candlesticks he's the one in the mid of
[1:18:25] the seven golden candlesticks that's
[1:18:27] what makes him the unchanging
[1:18:31] God because he's in the midst of the
[1:18:33] seven Goen
[1:18:36] Candlestick we going somewhere tonight
[1:18:38] that's what I want to bring you now uh
[1:18:42] uh let's drop down in in in chapter two
[1:18:45] let's go down a little bit here and uh
[1:18:49] uh chapter verse 8 chapter 2 ver8 and
[1:18:53] onto the angel of the church Church in
[1:18:55] SAR right these things said the first
[1:19:00] and the last which was dead and is alive
[1:19:05] praise the Lord are we together the
[1:19:09] first and the last is the Alpha and the
[1:19:14] Omega amen the first and the last is the
[1:19:20] beginning and the
[1:19:22] end are we together praise the Lord what
[1:19:26] the principle there is that God will
[1:19:30] show himself up at the beginning in in
[1:19:33] in in a mighty move in a mighty man
[1:19:36] manifestation and and and and during the
[1:19:38] church age it will looks like his
[1:19:40] present is gone or his present is dead
[1:19:44] the same thing in our life in our walk
[1:19:47] with God you know at at at our birth we
[1:19:51] see a move of God an experience of God
[1:19:54] and but there come a period of time
[1:19:55] where it looks like it's solent it looks
[1:19:58] like it's a dry year but because he's
[1:20:00] the Alpha and Omega if he did show up at
[1:20:04] the beginning he will show up at the
[1:20:09] end are we
[1:20:12] together he's the first and the last
[1:20:16] amen he that was dead and is
[1:20:22] alive let's go to verse 12
[1:20:28] and onto the angel of the Church of
[1:20:31] pagamas right these things said he which
[1:20:34] have the sharp swore with two edges now
[1:20:37] that's what we were
[1:20:39] reading so he's identifying himself to
[1:20:42] this age
[1:20:45] as the sharp edge the sharp sword with
[1:20:49] two
[1:20:50] edges amen the word of God is sharper
[1:20:54] than two edges SW amen now so let's go
[1:20:57] back to what we were reading from the
[1:20:59] pagamos church age so you can see where
[1:21:03] I'm going with
[1:21:04] this in these words he which had the
[1:21:08] sharp edge with with uh the sharp sword
[1:21:11] with two
[1:21:12] edges lies another revelation of the
[1:21:18] godhead in the Ephesian Age We recall he
[1:21:22] was set forth as the unchanged in God
[1:21:26] having the Seven Stars in the midst of
[1:21:28] the seven golden Canon State that's how
[1:21:31] he was set for so he was identified as
[1:21:34] the unchanging God are we together
[1:21:37] praise the Lord amen there is no
[1:21:41] situation that is going to come for God
[1:21:43] to change he Remains the Same he's the
[1:21:46] same yesterday today and
[1:21:49] forever are we together praise the Lord
[1:21:52] that's how he set for himself
[1:21:55] now in in the in the seel age we saw him
[1:21:58] as the
[1:22:00] one true God and beside him there is
[1:22:06] there was no other what did we read he's
[1:22:10] the first and the
[1:22:12] last amen so that's how he set forth
[1:22:16] himself in that age watch what I'm going
[1:22:18] with this tonight now in the pagamas age
[1:22:23] there is a a further revelation of the
[1:22:27] godhead now I told you that the open
[1:22:30] door is a further
[1:22:33] Revelation so what we are seeing here is
[1:22:36] that there is always a progressive
[1:22:39] revelation there is always more of God
[1:22:42] to
[1:22:44] know praise praise the Lord there is
[1:22:47] more of God to know there is more of God
[1:22:50] to experience
[1:22:55] are we
[1:22:57] together there is more of God so we
[1:23:00] seeing that every age was given one step
[1:23:05] further God keep bringing his people to
[1:23:08] a further
[1:23:10] Revelation because what is he trying to
[1:23:13] do is to get it from here down
[1:23:16] here amen he's taking it from just a
[1:23:20] mental knowledge to a life experience
[1:23:26] God is not satisfied not enough for you
[1:23:29] to just know him as the Jehovah of the
[1:23:31] Old Testament know him by all his seven
[1:23:34] Redemptive names and is not affecting
[1:23:36] your
[1:23:41] life
[1:23:45] amen if he's not affecting your life he
[1:23:48] don't know you now see that's the reason
[1:23:51] why Jesus said many will come to me in
[1:23:54] that day and said Lord haven't we healed
[1:23:56] the sick haven't we done he said depart
[1:23:58] from me I don't know
[1:24:04] you because we realize that going back
[1:24:08] to Genesis chapter 3 chapter 4 H uh uh
[1:24:12] the word no brings us a new sense it
[1:24:15] brings us an intimate
[1:24:17] sense the Bible says and Adam knew his
[1:24:20] wife and she conceived
[1:24:29] so it's just not enough for us to to to
[1:24:32] to know how to dress right and know how
[1:24:34] to no God want to be experienced in our
[1:24:40] life so he keeps bringing his people to
[1:24:44] a further
[1:24:49] Revelation do you see it praise the Lord
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:56] do you see it because when you go back
[1:24:58] to Revelation chapter 4 and and and and
[1:25:01] and uh and and we we can we we just read
[1:25:04] in pagamas we can go down and and
[1:25:08] read oh praise the lord we can read in
[1:25:11] the next Church age there the tarit
[1:25:13] church
[1:25:15] age what did the tarer church age says
[1:25:18] that's Verse
[1:25:19] 18 the angel of the teritorial church a
[1:25:22] these things said said the Son of God
[1:25:27] who have his eyes like onto a a flame of
[1:25:31] fire and his feet like onto a farm BR
[1:25:36] praise the
[1:25:37] Lord so you see it's it's all the
[1:25:40] identification of of the Lord Jesus is
[1:25:43] Jesus identifying
[1:25:48] himself praise the Lord Brother Brandon
[1:25:51] says God gave every age
[1:25:55] an access to the word a fresh access to
[1:25:58] the
[1:25:59] word so it was not just enough to preach
[1:26:03] paor
[1:26:04] gospel
[1:26:06] amen it is not just enough to preach
[1:26:10] about what happened in the
[1:26:13] past because he gave us access to
[1:26:16] himself for us to be able to experience
[1:26:19] him in present tense
[1:26:25] are we together in presentence in the
[1:26:28] changing of our life in the healing of
[1:26:30] our
[1:26:33] body praise the
[1:26:36] Lord
[1:26:40] amen in miracles in
[1:26:48] signs so territory at church age what uh
[1:26:52] uh he identified himself as the son of
[1:26:54] God there standing you know there the uh
[1:26:57] uh in a judgment form not not just uh
[1:27:00] want to take all of the time to look
[1:27:01] through that then we see here uh as we
[1:27:05] go down that's uh chapter 3 verse
[1:27:08] one
[1:27:12] uh to the side this
[1:27:15] age these things said the seven seven
[1:27:17] spirit of God we might we might take
[1:27:19] time to to be able to go through all of
[1:27:21] that but what what I wanted to show you
[1:27:24] because I reference to Revelation
[1:27:27] chapter 4 being a further Revelation
[1:27:30] praise the Lord and uh uh uh
[1:27:36] uh a sister reminded me on Sunday you
[1:27:39] know most of the time when we speak from
[1:27:41] Revelation chapter
[1:27:42] 4
[1:27:44] because the the the voice said come up
[1:27:47] higher we take that in the type of the
[1:27:52] Rapture because that's what brother Bram
[1:27:55] said in the church ages after the church
[1:27:57] age there is nothing left for the church
[1:27:59] but the Rapture that is just a
[1:28:04] type are we together it's just a type
[1:28:08] it's it's it's it's is one phase of
[1:28:12] Revelation chapter 4 but if you take
[1:28:14] Revelation chapter 4 in its actual
[1:28:18] application you'll realize that it will
[1:28:22] tie us to really tie that to the
[1:28:26] Rapture it's it's only a type to the
[1:28:29] Rapture because after the church age is
[1:28:32] done the only thing that is left for the
[1:28:34] church is what the
[1:28:36] Rapture so we can we can type that and
[1:28:39] say come up higher that is our our
[1:28:41] leaving the
[1:28:44] Earth praise the Lord are we
[1:28:49] together but there are things there in
[1:28:51] Revelation chapter 4 uh uh just hope
[1:28:55] that uh uh we can be able to see that
[1:28:57] tonight okay let's let's continue to
[1:28:59] read here in pamas church H and uh uh we
[1:29:03] try to to let you go for
[1:29:06] tonight praise the
[1:29:10] Lord so he's showing
[1:29:13] here that uh uh we we constantly seeing
[1:29:19] you know uh uh a revelation of the
[1:29:22] godhead Ephesian you know we recall the
[1:29:25] unchanging God the s that church age the
[1:29:28] one true God and none beside him now in
[1:29:31] the pamos church age there is a further
[1:29:34] revelation of the godhead set forth by
[1:29:38] his association with the Shar Edge sharp
[1:29:42] two Edge swap which is the word of God
[1:29:46] we know that Hebrews chapter 4 says for
[1:29:48] the word is quick and Powerful sharper
[1:29:52] there any two edges who piercing even to
[1:29:55] the dividing the
[1:29:56] suer of spirit and soul and to the
[1:30:00] joints and the marrow and a descender of
[1:30:03] the thoughts and the intense of the
[1:30:05] heart Ephesians 6 uh 17 and take the
[1:30:08] sword of the spirit so we see in here
[1:30:11] that that that is that is that is that
[1:30:14] is Christ in every form amen that's the
[1:30:18] word praise the
[1:30:21] Lord because we're we're where most of
[1:30:25] the time our our our our struggle is is
[1:30:29] that uh uh uh sometimes we get we get we
[1:30:32] get stuck in uh uh the way we we we
[1:30:37] understand a subject we have to realize
[1:30:41] that God is big he's the invisible
[1:30:45] Spirit one time he fill every
[1:30:49] space amen every
[1:30:52] space and it's hard to just put him in a
[1:30:56] box it's hard to just make him one thing
[1:30:59] in our brain because you see that's the
[1:31:02] trouble uh uh uh many times you uh we we
[1:31:05] we look at things this way and sometimes
[1:31:08] we are not able to to follow on to see
[1:31:11] how God is dealing with
[1:31:14] us praise the Lord amen when he's when
[1:31:19] he's moving us we we get scar because to
[1:31:22] us when when we lose that position we
[1:31:24] will be wrong we will be backsliding we
[1:31:26] will go to hell you have to realize that
[1:31:29] he have you in your in his hands and he
[1:31:31] says no man can pull you out it's not
[1:31:34] you keeping him he's the one keeping
[1:31:37] you praise the Lord but you see the
[1:31:40] danger also on the other side a person
[1:31:43] can can hold to something and then uh h
[1:31:46] h h uh when a preacher comes and seees
[1:31:48] something says oh W I never see that
[1:31:51] well we just being legalistic and and
[1:31:53] that's the reason why then pretty soon
[1:31:55] you run on the Fire
[1:31:59] end praise the
[1:32:02] Lord you have to realize just like I
[1:32:05] said on
[1:32:10] Sunday we are all
[1:32:12] growing amen and there is a growth in
[1:32:16] every stage of our
[1:32:18] life praise the Lord our growth is not
[1:32:23] on on how long we've been around the
[1:32:26] message or how many different churches
[1:32:29] or different ministers we start honor
[1:32:31] our growth is seen on how we handleing
[1:32:34] the
[1:32:37] word how do you handle the
[1:32:40] word when you come across a situation
[1:32:45] that you have not
[1:32:48] seen praise the Lord how do you handle
[1:32:50] the world what is your position
[1:32:54] are you quick to just run the
[1:32:56] Judgment oh everybody down there they
[1:32:59] are
[1:33:01] hypocrite praise the Lord oh you see
[1:33:04] that's the reason why I love that those
[1:33:06] good God from Africa they are on
[1:33:14] fired that's that's what shows our
[1:33:20] growth praise the Lord amen I'm working
[1:33:24] on something on growth but uh uh uh uh I
[1:33:28] might I might bring I'll bring it to you
[1:33:31] a little bit
[1:33:33] Yeah because that's that's what it is
[1:33:35] now John is out of the church ages he's
[1:33:38] going to have another further
[1:33:42] Revelation what what what is going to be
[1:33:45] revealed to him about Christ is going to
[1:33:48] be completely different from what was in
[1:33:50] the church ages but it's not going to be
[1:33:52] contrary to what was in the church
[1:33:59] ages are you seeing what I'm
[1:34:01] saying
[1:34:06] amen let's look at this quickly the
[1:34:12] uh uh 1 Corinthians
[1:34:19] 3:16 First Corinthian
[1:34:25] 3:16 if uh if I'm right in my head here
[1:34:29] praise the Lord are we together you love
[1:34:32] the
[1:34:35] Lord oh my goodness as in First
[1:34:38] Corinthian I'm over in the Book of
[1:34:48] Romans uh no I'm I'm off I'm off that's
[1:34:52] not what I'm looking for
[1:34:55] that's not what I'm looking for now let
[1:35:13] me are we together
[1:35:28] okay I see I see what I'm looking for
[1:35:32] butth if I want
[1:35:33] to
[1:35:40] uh you love the Lord tonight
[1:36:04] okay I see what I I send you to
[1:36:06] Corinthian is uh 2 Timothy chapter
[1:36:10] 3:16 because uh Second Corinthian have
[1:36:14] another phe of
[1:36:15] that uh but I won't look we won't look
[1:36:18] at that tonight let me just let me just
[1:36:20] bring there to look at there Second
[1:36:23] Corinthian Me 2 Timothy 3:16 there
[1:36:25] something that is we are very familiar
[1:36:27] with all scripture I gave him for
[1:36:41] inspiration so all scripture are given
[1:36:44] by inspiration of God and his profitable
[1:36:47] for Doctrine we have gone over there
[1:36:49] before reprove correction for
[1:36:52] instruction in righteousness now this is
[1:36:54] where I want for you to look at that is
[1:36:56] in verse 17 that the man of
[1:36:59] God not the child of
[1:37:02] God now many times when this scripture
[1:37:05] is
[1:37:06] read the man of God is only is pointed
[1:37:10] to the pastor that the man of God
[1:37:13] because he's the man of God but all
[1:37:16] scripture is not only for the
[1:37:19] pastor all
[1:37:21] scripture of inspiration ation for
[1:37:24] correction for for instruction is for
[1:37:26] every one of
[1:37:28] us amen but you see it is now for a
[1:37:34] child so look at look at the sense of
[1:37:37] the man of God as a grown up
[1:37:44] person
[1:37:47] okay a man not a child
[1:37:53] because we will not be able as a child
[1:37:57] we will not rightly apply it when when
[1:37:59] we supposed to use it for correction we
[1:38:01] could be using it for something else why
[1:38:03] because we are not grown up
[1:38:09] yet are we
[1:38:11] together amen now look at that look at
[1:38:15] that look at that and uh because
[1:38:19] sometimes the reason I'm saying all of
[1:38:21] this is because
[1:38:24] we are what we eat amen and uh
[1:38:28] Revelation 10:8 we've been given the
[1:38:30] book we must eat the book and uh uh uh
[1:38:33] the message has been given to us so we
[1:38:35] we can come up to a bride material not
[1:38:38] for us to be
[1:38:39] peners amen praise the lord it's it's
[1:38:43] all coming it's not just uh uh uh uh we
[1:38:46] are not just a Holiness Church we are
[1:38:49] more than a Holiness Church amen this is
[1:38:51] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:54] are we
[1:38:56] together amen look look at uh uh uh
[1:38:59] Hebrew chapter 5 uh I need to closeup
[1:39:03] here now tonight was another prayer
[1:39:08] meeting so I'm I'm all over the
[1:39:12] place are we
[1:39:21] together now look at look look at uh
[1:39:24] verse 12 Hebrew chap
[1:39:27] 5:12 you should keep these both
[1:39:29] scripture in your mind because I'm
[1:39:30] coming back to it again not tonight but
[1:39:33] another time but I just want you I just
[1:39:36] want us to keep it in our
[1:39:38] mind amen now verse 12 the scripture
[1:39:42] says for for for when fall the time you
[1:39:47] ought to be
[1:39:49] teachers ye have need that one teach you
[1:39:52] again
[1:39:56] which be the first principle of the
[1:39:59] Oracle of God we shared that with you
[1:40:02] before teaching is the first Oracle
[1:40:05] that's the first thing you do to a child
[1:40:07] you teach
[1:40:08] them amen teaching is the first Oracle
[1:40:12] but you see what what uh uh Paul is
[1:40:15] saying here is that if you go back few
[1:40:19] verses you will see that Paul was
[1:40:21] talking about mechis or
[1:40:26] MEC and he told them there's a whole lot
[1:40:29] of things I can say to
[1:40:32] you but I can see that you are not grown
[1:40:35] up to receive
[1:40:39] it
[1:40:43] amen he says we are stayed if you go
[1:40:46] back if you go back from the beginning
[1:40:47] of the chapter chapter 4 he's telling
[1:40:49] them let's let's move on to
[1:40:51] Perfection we are struggling around
[1:40:54] baptized in Jesus name and you know I'm
[1:40:57] baptized in Jesus name you know I'm in
[1:41:00] the message we we we he says you there
[1:41:02] are more in the word there are more of
[1:41:05] God to know there are more that the that
[1:41:08] the that that this messenger has brought
[1:41:11] us this spiritual food in due season
[1:41:14] there is more in it for us to eat
[1:41:25] then chasing ourself about oh dressing
[1:41:28] right coming to church on time and and
[1:41:30] and uh and we are backsliding and and
[1:41:33] and our prayer life and and we just
[1:41:47] babies he said for the time when you
[1:41:49] ought to be
[1:41:51] teachers when the older ones ought to be
[1:41:53] teaching the young
[1:41:55] ones we are fing with the young
[1:41:58] ones we are criticizing
[1:42:01] them no we ought to be
[1:42:04] teachers we ought to know that we all
[1:42:06] are
[1:42:17] growing it's not wingking our heads and
[1:42:19] hting our teeth no being able to pull a
[1:42:22] a a a a person on your way and and and I
[1:42:25] mean you can even be able to bring it
[1:42:28] that they will not even feel a sense of
[1:42:31] judgment a sense of
[1:42:34] condemnation for when we ought to be
[1:42:36] teachers we need to be
[1:42:39] taught again which are the first
[1:42:41] principle of the Oracle of
[1:42:43] God and I
[1:42:45] become such as have need of milk and not
[1:42:50] of strong food
[1:42:53] praise the
[1:42:57] Lord I mean when we get it we want to
[1:43:01] talk about the SE we'll just we just
[1:43:03] have to read you know we come and read
[1:43:05] quotes and read quotes and read quotes
[1:43:06] and read quotes just so I I I can prove
[1:43:09] to you that I'm I'm preaching the
[1:43:11] message or I'm saying what the prophet
[1:43:14] said and it just become a bunch of
[1:43:18] information I can bring 20 quot on just
[1:43:21] one thing brother Brandon is say we
[1:43:23] don't need 20
[1:43:27] quot we know that when it comes to the
[1:43:30] word praise the Lord when it comes to
[1:43:33] the word the messenger gave us what is
[1:43:35] the
[1:43:40] word oh no he said that one in 47 in in
[1:43:43] 63 he said this what what is that if you
[1:43:46] understand further
[1:43:47] Revelation you understand if you
[1:43:50] understand growth you understand how God
[1:43:52] progressed
[1:43:54] how Revelation
[1:43:58] progress the word of God will not be
[1:44:00] clashing with one
[1:44:04] another when you see forces and strive
[1:44:06] and argument is it's a sense of a need
[1:44:10] of
[1:44:16] growth are we together the same thing
[1:44:19] again I didn't even get what I want to
[1:44:20] say but it's good
[1:44:23] you love the Lord Revelation chapter 4:1
[1:44:26] let's read that again and then we
[1:44:38] close I was listening to the message of
[1:44:41] Grace this morning oh my God oh my God I
[1:44:44] was just saying I was saying Lord Jesus
[1:44:48] please help
[1:44:50] us I mean I would just that's another
[1:44:53] thing let's let's just let's just read
[1:44:55] Revelation
[1:44:57] 4:1 and then uh we will we will close
[1:45:00] here and after this I look and behold a
[1:45:04] door was open in heaven and the and the
[1:45:07] first verse which I I heard was as it
[1:45:10] were of a trumpet talking to me a
[1:45:14] trumpet talking to me not a trumpet
[1:45:16] blowing but a trumpet talking to me so
[1:45:18] that trumpet was not a physical trumpet
[1:45:20] got physical trumpet don't talk it blow
[1:45:23] amen so it was as a trumpet talking to
[1:45:26] me we said come up hither and I will
[1:45:29] show thee things which must be Hereafter
[1:45:34] and immediately when that voice spoke
[1:45:39] immediately
[1:45:42] immediately that's when the word affect
[1:45:46] us it take us from looking at F bound
[1:45:50] things
[1:45:54] praise the
[1:45:56] Lord
[1:45:57] immediately the effect of the
[1:46:01] word the word has H uh H an immediate
[1:46:13] effect immediately I was in the spirit
[1:46:16] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[1:46:21] and one sat on on the
[1:46:24] throne praise the
[1:46:28] Lord amen Heaven consists of the word
[1:46:31] throne is the Dominion one sat on the
[1:46:34] throne now so you see another a further
[1:46:38] Revelation another revelation of Jesus
[1:46:40] is coming to show us that there is not
[1:46:43] preer there is nothing like Father Son
[1:46:45] and the Holy Ghost up
[1:46:48] there amen it was one throne and one sat
[1:46:52] on on the
[1:46:54] throne so you see a further revelation
[1:46:57] of the
[1:47:04] godhead are we to are we together
[1:47:10] amen and he that sat was to look upon
[1:47:15] like Jasper and s stone and there was a
[1:47:21] rainbow around the about The
[1:47:24] Throne inside like onto an emerald now
[1:47:28] he was the the the Jas part inside is he
[1:47:31] it's the same thing that was back in the
[1:47:32] church ages like I said the first and
[1:47:34] the last because it's it have to do with
[1:47:37] the 12 Stones the 12 trap of Israel is
[1:47:39] identifying itself again as the first
[1:47:42] and the
[1:47:43] last so saying Jasper and sing Stones
[1:47:47] should not throw us off as something
[1:47:50] completely he's he's maintaining his uh
[1:47:53] his seen identity but in a progressive
[1:47:58] form praise the Lord why is he using H
[1:48:02] uh jaspera and sadden Stones
[1:48:05] here because right after the church ages
[1:48:08] the Redemption of the Jews
[1:48:11] comes so he that identify himself to us
[1:48:15] in the church ages as the Alpha and
[1:48:18] Omega he's identifying himself to the
[1:48:20] Jews as the alpha and Omega but for them
[1:48:24] to be able to receive it he got to
[1:48:26] identify himself in their
[1:48:30] Stone the jaspa is the first stone the
[1:48:33] siden is the last
[1:48:39] Stone so it's going to be the revelation
[1:48:42] of Jesus Christ that is going to redeem
[1:48:44] the
[1:48:47] Jews praise the
[1:48:49] Lord and with one on the throne it bring
[1:48:53] both Jews and Gentile together because
[1:48:56] the Jews are not going to take our
[1:48:59] Trinity amen they are not going to take
[1:49:02] three on the throne no they're going to
[1:49:04] take one yeah Israel the Lord our God is
[1:49:08] one and all through the church ages he's
[1:49:12] keep revealing himself to the church
[1:49:14] that he's only one
[1:49:25] are we together amen so you see it's
[1:49:29] it's it's not it's not just
[1:49:33] information the the the the greatest
[1:49:36] desire of the
[1:49:38] father amen is for him to be one with
[1:49:44] you amen praise the
[1:49:48] Lord he has given us an Open Door
[1:49:54] every one of us have an open door and an
[1:49:56] opportunity has been open to
[1:49:59] us to see the revelation of Jesus to

[1:50:13] closer to the one that want to be made
[1:50:15] one with
[1:50:20] you there is one throne
[1:50:23] what's that Throne your
[1:50:27] heart and he want to be the only one
[1:50:30] sitting on that
[1:50:34] Throne he don't want to share that
[1:50:36] throne with no fleshly desire he don't
[1:50:39] want to share that trone with no W
