Caribbean tomorrow uh for a convention and thereafter some meetings uh pray for grace pray for strength and pray for protection the Lord bless you as you do amen Romans chapter 9 uh okay let let's not worry about N9 tonight let's take Romans chapter 8 verse 28 in Proverbs Chapter 19 verse 21 Romans 8 is is a chapter we all know we can that verse everybody can almost read it off hand but let's just read it together Romans 8:28 if you are there say amen amen and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are they called according to his purpose amen Proverbs 1921 1921 there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy word amen God bless you you may please be seated greetings from Nigeria one more time and from all the other Brethren who with whom I've spoken in the course of my being here amen I want to thank uh everybody once again for encouraging us with your presence uh yesterday we drove some two hours to visit a brother and uh two hours to two hours from and uh for me it shows some sort of sacrifice uh people make to come today the house of the Lord amen some of you there was a time we went to Mayo Clinic area and it was uh kind of a distance also yes sister Nami we've been there and it was uh some sort of a distance also so that also gave an impression of the length people go to make it to the house of the Lord indeed where the carass is the Eagles will be gathered nothing will prevent an eagle of God uh from reaching out for ease or our food so thank you all for coming again tonight your coming I want you to know is an encouragement and may the Lord bless you for your sacrifices and uh I've enjoyed so much care since I came and uh I want to thank all the masam and the aunties uh uh one of them brought food for us this afternoon so we're just jamming food upon food we've never had a lack last Sunday we're taking for a very good lunch and the pastor's household have been also doing wonderfully I'm feeling the weight of your ministry already in my body it's been very physically edifying and I pray that the Lord will bless you uh bless every one of you my brother who picked me at the airport and everybody who's done one thing or the other amen if you have a chance to come to Nigeria sister cassete does not want to come to Nigeria I hope she repents of that she said she's happy for me to be coming but not for her to come over isn't isn't that a partial uh Arrangement anyway have been faithful to mine I hope you be you will rise up one day but anytime you have the opportunity to come by us uh it doesn't get too cold for us to attend to you neither does it get too late feel free anytime uh we'll do all we can to make you uh as comfortable as we could in our own little way so the Lord bless you very much I trust to God I'll will see you again uh and I don't think there's any doubt about that because we are related about 10 11 months ago when I came I said we shall see again and God has made it possible we are seeing again amen so I trust to God he will give us another appointment and if he comes before that time we miss nothing so if we don't see here we see hope there that's very certain so may the Lord keep you healthy keep you strong keep you happy serving the lord uh till we meet again God bless you thank you Pastor for this privilege I appreciate every bit of it God bless you amen all right tonight I just thought we will speak and something God put upon my heart but uh because it's a midweek service I may not be able to go to the length uh of it but I trust it will give us enough out of it amen uh to be able to take something home that will help us in our journey here so tonight I want to speak on the purpose of God Amen the purpose of God and uh this subject I look at it in two ways one is the purpose of God and the other is a purpose for God broadly speaking there are two category of people on the Earth and uh each category belong to a site of this there are those who are serving the purpose of God and there's those who are serving a purpose for God they are the ones the people serving the purpose for God are the one who makes necessary for God to do certain things in the life of those who are serving the purpose of God it will be clear as we go along amen amen the prophet in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said God has a three-fold purpose amen and it said one the first is to reveal himself and in order to reveal himself the entire spirit being called God because God is a spirit don't forget amen out to prepare a body for himself and express himself in human flesh because there's no other way for God to reveal himself than to become tangible so the tangibility of God was Jesus Christ amen and that is why because it has to be a full revelation of God himself the fullness of God Earth has to do what come into that body you have God in measures but our Lord has him in fullness that is why when Philip said show us the father and it will suffice he said for this long that I've been with you you you don't know me Philip could have said Master you got it wrong I know you but I want to know the father amen but there is no other way the father could be declared than through the body called Christ because if it comes here as a spirit nobody will see him amen will not know his nature will will not know the way he works his manners so Christ came to humanize deity for all of us so that we can see who God actually is but you see this is a deep Revelation Meant For Those whom it is meant for because it is only those who actually received the revelation of him that can submit to his preeminence you must know God for who he is in order for you to be fully submissive to him one of the reasons they crucified Christ for in the Bible was that they said he being man maketh himself God did you catch that in other words they couldn't come to terms with the fact that this guy Apprentice Carpenter boy that they gave their stool their chairs to repair some years back could come back and say he is the geover of the whole Testament brother Braham said that's a super sign Jehovah God crawled like a baby on the floor maybe when he was craw crawling as a baby he must have picked some death on the floor and Mama must have tapped the hand I said I've told you not to be picking death some people witnessed that when Jesus was growing some people saw him todle some people saw him you know struggling to take a step they saw him eventually walking they saw him when he will go with Father Joseph to his carpentry or Furniture designer workshop and they saw him learning measurements and everything so how this could now amount to God was too much for many people amen but all those things makes it a super sign yes are you catching it in the message taken side with Jesus the prophet said no matter what anybody has got to say about Christ those who will believe him will still believe him are you a Believer tonight amen is there anything that can tell you contrary about Christ that can make you change your Bel in him oh your the womb of your mind is sealed to him already Hallelujah there is a reason for that amen so he's going to reveal himself amen those for whom this Revelation is ordained church because it is not for everybody and that that was why when Christ when he came in flesh the Bible said he was speaking parables in the open but in the closet he will dissect The Parables and make it so plain he did it so much until even the disciples took notes they said sir how come when we are outside you were always talking in Proverbs and you didn't care whether anybody was offended or not so as to even explain better you never bothered but when we come in here without we soliciting without we begging for it you will sit us down and be expounding The Parables they ask him as a question you know what he answered he said unto you it is given yes that's right thank so the Lord by that showed that am to whom he will revelate reveal himself to his Sovereign he is Sovereign in that nobody can challenge him nobody can tell him who to show or who not to show he does that out of his own free will and he chooses is selective about those whom he give his revelation we see that clearly from the scripture so it is not everybody that we have the revelation of Jesus Christ it is only a certain category of people and why is he unveiling himself to them Isaiah said all your children oh Lord shall be taught by you yes all the children of God will be taught by God the prophet said God does not have obligation to teach kain's children Revelation so he has obligation only to his own children you know why because they have a purpose to serve that's right so he will reveal himself by that Revelation he will have preeminence they will come to a point point that they will not be able to do anything except what he says in the message the Holy Spirit gave to the prophet to write he said those in the bright do only his will yes nothing can make them do otherwise they either get dust say the Lord or they keep still by their Divine chemistry they are not designed to hear the voice of a stranger they are not designed to be Be Inspired or pushed by the by a stranger they only listen to One Voice Because by the revelation of Christ to them Christ has taken preeminence the revelation of God sealed their womb they can listen to no other that is preeminence so they listen to only one person and that is Jesus Christ and by that preeminence they will be restored back to the original beginning where men fell from so Christ has a three-fold purpose one to reveal himself two to have preeminence in the life of Those whom he revealed himself to and by that preeminence three to restore them back to Eden our original beginning where we fell from those who enjoyed those three articles of purpose or Revelation they are the one who are in the purpose of God they are the one for whom all things work together for good when the Bible said all things work together for good he made a caveat not for everybody he said to them that love the Lord to them who are de called something must call you brother Braham said music call some people amen the need for connection brought some people some wanted uh Society some wanted somewhere to belong brought some people he said but the only call that will ever last is a called by the word of God and he said those who may call by the word are already in him before the foundation of the world so when the word calls them they only responding to what they are and that is why Heaven and Earth may pass away nothing will shake their feet they will remain permanently they can never leave amen no matter how H it gets they will stay no matter how freezing cold it gets they will stay amen weather does not tamper with their commitment it doesn't tamper with their devotion amen that is why Paul said what shall separate us from is is in that same chapter from the love of God he mentioned everything that could happen to human being as a vile as evil he said but nay in all these things we are what mother than conqueror to them serving God is not transactional if I pay you this you must give me this that's transaction amen for them whether they get something out of it listen to me church or they got nothing out of it they keep serving the lord amen they know that God can do all things yes but they also know that God may not may choose not to do all he can do and still it will wouldn't affect their devotion you are not getting me amen the three Hebrew children said told Nebuchadnezzar he said oh King live forever amen as for this matter we are not careful in other word we are not afraid but at the same time we are not arrogant but we are not afraid to tell you our position we will tell you very excuse me very nicely and whether you toss us up and down 50 times it will be the same answer we are not going to bow down your image what informs your boldness we know our God can deliver us but wait a minute prayer if he chooses not to deliver us yet we shall still not bow down in other word whether it pays us or it does not pay us our devotion our answer is the same that's right they understood God's sovereignty amen amen so to them it's beyond bread and butter Christianity amen so what they have and what do do not have does not tamper with their faithfulness with their Devotion to God are you catching it yes those guys are in the purpose of God because they received a PE of great priz something what brought them into God's economy is greater to them than anything that life could afford you love him amen now I'm just showing you Redemption story in another way this revelation of God to have preeminence and to restore you is the entire Redemption story but guess what who facilitated it Satan it's a story you all know and I'll bring it from there I'll bring it from The Exodus it was the devil that makes the revelation of Christ of God possible because what is the essence of God becoming flesh you will say in order to come and redeem man isn't it yes why did man need a Redemption because he fell because he fell amen who occasioned the fall it was Satan yes are you catching it so Satan did a purpose for God when you see people who whom God used and yet they do not benefit from the blessings of that use they are just having a purpose for God Amen are you catching it yes the prophet said when Satan has brought to pass that which was necessary to the purpose of God he brought the fall that make the Redeemer necessary isn't it that make the Healer necessary that make the Savior necessary that make the Deliverance necessary but did he himself partake in the blessings of the Redeemer no did he partake in the blessings of the Savior did he partakes in the blessings of the deliverer did he get the blessings of the Healer no but he facilitated the reason for which Christ will become flesh so he served a purpose for God but those who partake in all those blessings they are the one in the purpose of God brother Braham said atonement does not start from body healing he said the beginning of atonement is the healing of your soul yes he said that is why he said if it can save your soul it can heal your body are you catching it so if you are getting the lesser lesser teeth beat and you are flying the real essence of Christ coming in flesh is to bring you back to sunship yes is to bring you back to daughter the prophet said if you meet miss that purpose you have missed the mark So when you are being brought back to sunship it is the evidence that you are the one in the purpose of God but the process that facilitated it is a purpose for God okay let me take you another example amen it will be clearer now how many ever read in the Bible when it said for this cause did that raise Pharaoh yes have you read it like that in the Bible brother Braham said I think it was in the Lamb's Book when he was talking about the book of life that he even said Pharaoh really has no original record it was just brought in for certain yes okay thank you all right they catching it now for this cause did I raise Pharaoh what was the cause Rose Pharaoh the Bible said a pharaoh that knew not the blessings of Joseph arose and did what and start bringing oppression that makes esod do Redemption necessary amen did you you C that now the people who partook in that Redemption who were brought out and eventually brought into the economy of the promise because the prophet said Redemption has two parts being brought out of somewhere and being brought into somewhere amen between being brought out and being brought in there may be a ping process to take out every unbelief so that in your settling down you are settling down for good amen now the people who have that blessings we are in the purpose of God but Pharaoh that made it necessary was only serving a purpose for God so those are the two side of purposes in life and each of us is on one side but I hope I'm speaking to the crowd to decide who are in the purpose of God praise the Lord amen now I'm elaborating this so that you see believer is PED by the word there are certain things or certain people that will do things in your life and because of the bitterness of experience you get from there you are want to hold it against them but when you receive messages like this it will help you to liberate yourself you know when you tie people down you actually the one tied down you don't know okay let me give you simple scripture Jesus said if you forgive I will forgive you it's a simple mathematics in the Bible how many ever read it and to underscore it he even gave you a parable he said I was a servant praise God Amen who loves the Lord tonight amen he said there was a servant who was hold who hold his master let's say $100 and the master said you go get that guy and detain him for me and the man came and was begging Master have mercy upon me I'm really working at paying this thing if you put me in prison my family is in trouble I'll be demobilized I won't even be able to raise the money just have mercy in your own heart of art forgive me use your church art your church mind and the master looked at him he said you know what write off the money let him go free oh he felt so free he felt so great but this guy is a wicked guy yes I used that word Wicked because that was what the master called him you know as he was going out he saw his own colleague servant who hold him $10 and guess what he committed the guy to prison till he might be able to pay that $10 and some folks who felt that this thing is this picture is not looking right started grumbling and Grumble got to the master and the master said what am I hearing go call that guy for me said I forgave you 100 you couldn't let go of 10 you are a wicked guy and you know what the master did he withdrew his own pardon because this guy couldn't forgive are you catching it yeah he withdrew his own pardon and committed him to prison till he will be able to pay the money so it's a simple principle if you forgive you will be forgiven brother Braham said we will go to a point in our Christian experience that we don't feel ought or we don't get ought again no matter what anybody does we try to rise above the pain that is our Mark of I call in French and it is the wedge that will bring you to such a stature that is why you need to hear things like this and believer must start seeing goodness in every adversity amen no matter what anybody does Amen look away from the person Hallelujah if Steven never looked away from Saul it will CA all but the prophet said he looked at the right place yes and when he looked at the right place I the Bible said he saw heaven opened yeah my goodness look at the right place brother brother look at the right place sister you will see the vision of God the Bible said he saw heaven open you think Heaven opened for nothing there was a conversation going on God was showing him look that guy even though don't be carried away by his Veil even though he's a soul but there's a pole inside amen do not say things or do things that will hinder his manifestation just speak peace and because Steven had tasted the pardon of God he was born under the impression of forgiveness oh my right I think you have to preach that amen you say uh when you are been born whatever your mama uttered as in the Hebrew mothers now the prophet said what their mamas uttered in their birth positionally please those children and follow them in life amen it's a principle so I advise mothers all the time when you expecting or those who will expect when that hour come I actually do not know the pains I agree but what I want you to do is in the eat of that pain never speak anything negative you know the prophet said even though it's a natural birth yet there's a spiritual element He said that is why no matter how Wicked a woman is when she's nearing at delivery she Mellows down in spirit because an Angelic being is overing around a spirit is overing around waiting to vent life into the baby that is to be born so that Spirit conditions so it is all together not the physical bed there's a supernatural element to that delivery that is why you must be careful what you say because the prophet said what the Hebrew mother said followed those Patriarchs so much so that when they got to the land of the lands were divided by what their mam uttered so the utterances of their mom became their Destiny come on church we have a mom too you know you do you know we have a mom yeah you don't know our mommy now you sing is everything is everything to me don't you sing that is my father my mother my sister and my my brother is everything to me who are you referring to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and the Bible called him El Shai the meaning of el Shai is the breasted one you don't use the breasted one for a man that is the motherhood of God praise the Lord so on the cross of Calvary he gave birth to you and I brother brah said he took us all to the Cross amen Gethsemane was the labor room Calvary was delivery room and you were born under cerian Section Hallelujah so surgery is not bad after all the the Roman soldier thought we wanted to do an orthopedic surgery he went to carry Hammer to break the word that have been spoken by David some 7 800 years ago he thought God's words expired Amen brother Braham said behind every statement of God he allocates a power and he goes to rest when the appointed time for that word to come to pass is AR he said the power behind the word will wake it up Hallelujah this is how I know every promise is valid is active and is relevant to those who can call Jesus on the scene he picked up the hammer and they went for the first Chief Thief they broke the legs the reason they could break the leg of the thieves was because because there was no promise contrary to that amen but of Jesus the Bible said not one bone of his body shall be broken and no matter how much the devil tried he would't break it yes he thought because Christ has passed out on the cross his words have also passed out oh the strength of Israel can never lie neither can he fail the moment they brought the armor to Jesus the word came alive and said dumb Soldier drop that Hammer whose leg do you want to break the word himself drop the hammer we are not doing orthopedic surgery here we are doing cerian section it's a delivery amen not a traumatic orthopedic surgery and the guy dropped the hammer and he picked the spear amen and the Lord told him go for his side left side right below his heart because the one coming is going to be his love part glory to God he going to be dear and close to his AR that is the one [Applause] coming and like the sergeon we use that needle point to open and cut the Flesh and you know separate the layers this was done and the birth experience started happening blood water came out and guess what who came out I came out yes sir you came out because the word must be fulfilled except the cor of we dies and he's buried he abided alone but if he's died buried and rotten is going to come up whereas one Jesus were killed many jesuses came out of the one that was killed several seeds of Conn from the only one that was planted glory to God when our mama was given birth to us before she passed out on the cross what was he saying the pastor is in the spirit father forgive them for they know not what they were so you were born under the birth pain utterance of forgiveness so you cannot TR be born again by Christ and not have a forgiven Spirit if you lack it you will tell us who your mama is so meaning forgiveness will be a natural to those who are born again God's believing children there will be nothing too hard for them not to forgive and that is why Fellowship is easy to flow among Believers amen that is why Believers Are Not Afraid in the congregation of Believers because they know if they step on toes they will get forgiveness amen oh man I pray the Lord will multiply it at a revelation to you amen whether some somebody even deliberately does it or not it doesn't matter to the believer amen because he looking at the greater picture so when Steven was looking up there God was interceding for Paul and that was why he said Lord lay it not to their charge I mean you look at Paul when he eventually became converted it's constant regret was how he persecuted The Church Without measure how many read that in the Bible he will always refer to it now what if he has an additional sight of Steven saying Lord require my blood from this man how do you think Paul will feel all his life he will want that question settled but Steven released him release everybody in your Camp yes release everybody in your cage so that you yourself could Prosper so that you yourself could have your way because the prophet said if you keep ought against any man you are walking over the danger of Hell Fire so if the Lord has done this in your life amen you are in the purpose of God you love him tonight the prophet said anything that serves the purpose of God will have what a resurrection and I want to say this whether you to serve the purpose of God or a purpose for God you will have Resurrection that's right the question is in what Resurrection yes are you catching it now the scriptures spoke of a better Resurrection is the language of the Bible Hebrews chapter 11 he said all those Saints all those Heroes of Faith they refuse compromise Deliverance a delance that will come with compromise sacrifice of the word they are not ready to no they said we rather die than to deny the word friends you are going to the same Heaven they went so this is why we in our day cannot be wishy-washy and tell you what they never had as much as we are having right the revelation we have today they never had it Daniel peeped into it God said excuse me shut it up never preached it even John that brought the Book of Revelation gave it in symbols yes amen it was only in these last days that we received the revelation of the symbol so we are having a better deal than them all but in the much that they had see their life so that means automatically with the greater things we have our life will be the better right because we are to be the cstone the sealing of the others in all ages they are perfection without you they are not perfect amen so what a life we are called on to but all these Brethren refused compromise Deliverance the Bible said in order that they might obtain a better Resurrection so it's the language of the Bible not mine amen and why is the Resurrection the better because the first resurrection that better one has many other packages is it's just like you are going on vacation and they tell you that this is $1,000 package this is 3,05 package the organizers are not dumb if they make one $1,000 and they make one 3,05 before you jump at saying I got a bargain you better check the contents of your package because what is loaded in the 30005 package cannot be the same with what is in 1,000 package if you don't take care to check those things when you get there you will see a lot of access denied for you that's right and they say if you want those access open pay the balance that is the same way it is in the kingdom of God there are some access deny level Pastor because if you don't come up in a better Resurrection you have a lesser package those who come up in the first and the better will enjoy the Rapture h three and a half years wedding supper is in the package the Lord 1,000 years of Millennium is in the package amenallah sitting on the white Throne judgment to judge the Earth it's in the package and when eternity sets in Pastor living in the first Square City it's in the package but do you know what those who come up in the second and general Resurrection will miss those packages this is why the Bible qualified one as the better resurrection and the other is as just Resurrection those who serve the purpose of God will have a better Resurrection amen even if you never serve any purpose you will come up in the second one and the second one is very Daisy amen amen you can make it or may not make it amen so everybody will be resurrected the question is in what resurrection and let me say this tonight like I said we're just taking extracts from the entire length the purpose of God can never be defeated right amen and the prophet said and you all will agree with with me each of us that is on Earth today we are brought for a purpose that's right whether it's a purpose for him or a purpose of him both cannot be defeated because nobody no situation can resist the will of God yes if God made a man a pharaoh he cannot change himself he must do that Pharaoh activity if he made him a Judas es scariot he must serve that purpose that's what it means that's right nobody can resist his will so it's a privilege if you find yourself on the righteous side when you know these things nobody will beg you to Worship the Lord amen you will know that your whole life must be a worship to the Lord this was a revelation brother boswood had and he got excited every day he will say I look at myself among all the billions that are on Earth that God will single me out in my own little corner for salvation when he could have taken somebody else beside me what is the marriage election what is election the love of God his free will it's good pleasure whatever he wanted because you and I never lived any life in advance to Merit what we are having today you never impressed him amen the prophet said in the back part of his mind he drew his own conclusion and he said he has has never had or taken away from his thoughts his original thinking remains his final thinking till today so you and I were are brought here for a purpose right you love him tonight so let me say this it is wrong for a man to say I want to design a purpose for my life I'm sounding rude or hard I want to design a purpose for my life if you study the message you will never see a language like that you hardly let me not say you will never but I never seen a language like that but the language you would rather see the prophet saying is if you can find your purpose finding your purpose is different from you developing a purpose your job is a job of Discovery not a job of designing or conceiving you know why you didn't create yourself that's right amen see this microphone in my hand it was somebody who looked and said if we could make something that will ampify the voices of human being when they are speaking a larger audience of people could benefit from their speech is that right right because no matter how much a man shouts he might not be able to reach a wide audience but we make this to amplify his voice and we make this speakers to carry the Amplified voice are you not hearing me now and I'm not training my voice to speak you understand so that means somebody came up with a purpose you understand he now designed this product to meet that purpose this product was not the one that designed itself for the purpose it's having tonight are you catching it huh now you take it back to yourself This is why there is no useless person in God's economy my Bible said you are fearfully and wonderfully made you are like a portion in the body Temple of the Living God do you know in the temple of Solomon God taught us a vital lesson all the materials the stones that were used for that Temple were said to be brought from all over the world but as they are coming in into Jerusalem to be fitted into saw the temple building each was Finding their place isn't that Supernatural yeah they didn't have to be record or shapen or beating with armor each Stone cut as they came from all the countries that they came from was finding a place it was just came to here this one came to here this one came to here then they find one they call it an hot stone and they said this one does not really have a place they throw it away when they were about finishing the Cor cor Stone they find a gap missing and they use they walk on every stone they brought every stone to Feit nobody fitted until they went for the rejected Stone it logged into that place this is why you are fearfully and wonderfully made church let me tell you tonight there is nobody sitting here tonight that God brought you accidentally even if your parents T your conception was mistake you know human say we we W planning for that but it came it is you not planning God was planning did you hear me it was a mistake it's a language of human being in God's economy there is no coincidence neither is there any mistake that is why the prophet said when the Lord send them we will receive them are you following because nobody came here by chance you were brought here because you have a purpose to serve that is what I'm saying right amen God is not a showman who does things just to show he can do it and if God located you in bringing you to the Earth in this part of America is because you have your purpose to serve here it puts me in the economy where I am because I will work better there are you catching it I will be more I will serve I'll be useful for his purpose there than here amen and he put you here because you'll be useful for his purpose here than there and when he puts you in a local assembly you are also not an accident it's purpose keep trickling and keep unfolding every hour even to the minutest detail of your life to the family he brought you in that's right the prophet said there are reasons for these things they don't just happen by chance when this when you understand this you will not child God foolishly you will not say why me Lord why did you even put me into this family why why all those why we begun and you you need to remove the why so you can see the purpose right because there's a purpose for everything yes that's right there's a purpose for flowers there's a purpose for the tree there's a purpose for the moon there's a purpose for the sun those are lesser creature when it compared with you if God find purpose for nature how much more his children amen you forfeit your peace you burn energy too much and you get born out because you are laboring to design and not to discover God already designed you for a purpose the prophet said find it that's right that's all he said look for it and stay there he said because in his purpose he will bless you now look at this equipment as long as it's serving its purpose he will enjoy care from the owner isn't it yes they will come they will clean it they will check if the battery is okay if there's anything they'll polish it that is your life the reason you don't feel that loving HS of God his protective his maintenance his support is because you are still killed outside of his purpose when you come into his purpose God takes obligation for your maintenance amen he brought you here amen and as long as you are serving that purpose you shall be maintained yes does this mic have to cry for battery before we know we should they are batteries charging there already oh yes I saw them on Sunday charging some already charged waiting to be put in there so that his purpose can be blessed isn't it God is mindful of that that is you as human being you are mindful of if I want to enjoy the use of this car I must maintain it isn't it yes regular servicing you are the one checking it for the car not the car checking it for itself you'll be keeping your eye for the cars that self diagnose themselves they will tell you when they are du you if they are programmed at 5,000 miles on the nearing 5,000 mil they will tell you but you are conscious you are watching let me be sure I'm not I've not run out of miles you will pay to maintain the car and because the car is serving this purpose the payment looks like nothing you are happy to pay the dealers or the technicians to check this to check this you happy to go and wash the car we traveled yesterday and you know the screen become a bit blurry coming back with insect the Pastor said let us stop by and wash our car the car doesn't have to protest or tell us to get that the owner knows what to do that is why your owner said take no thought did you catch that yes for what to eat what to drink or where which shall you be clo he said your owner knows you need these things your own job is seek first his kingdom serve your own purpose then I will maintain you whether you ask for maintenance or not I know what to do that's what he said can our Revelation go higher and it doesn't matter where you are serving your purpose if it's in the village if it's in the city the god of the city is the god of the village it will take care of you it is those who lack the revelation of purpose that are jumping here and there and think that until I get here my life cannot be better your life is better by the purpose you serve are you with me S so it's important we wait upon the Lord Lord why did you bring me here brother Braham said that's what you should ask he said somebody is responsible for you being brother here he said have you asked him why you are here right he said when you ask him sincerely he will give every answer when you discover your purpose stay in there brother Braham said I find my purpose is to bring souls to the kingdom he said I am determined more than ever to uphold that purpose to serve it and as long as he does he's maintained Hallelujah you see how to make life easy oh what you don't need to forfeit your peace just understand the principles and I want you to know that what purifies you what PES you what makes you holy what retain your blessing is the purpose you serve my sister your nice dressing dressing as Christian sister is not what makes you holy right it is the purpose that appearance serves amen godess that purifies you because when God sees you in that appearance he knows you are doing something for the kingdom you are defining to the world how a Christian should be when you you dress right is a worship to God that's what the prophet said he said worship is not only singing he said anytime you do that which is right he say you are worshiping God if somebody is taking the name of the Lord in vain and you can rise up and say my brother my sister there's a better life than this don't do that he said you have worshiped the Lord amen so it is the purpose how the things we do it is the purpose they serve that purifies us are you catching it the reason we are cleaning that car is because it's serving the purpose if the car refuses to carry us again and it becomes a liability we're going to make it a junk that shows he has what rebelled against his own purpose we find no use for it he's going to gather dust somewhere or we are going to auction it as a are you catching it but as long as he serving it we will change the oil we'll renew it from inside as long as we will wash it because we know every death on the car speaks of the owner you didn't catch that if the car is dirty nobody abuses the car they abuse the owner he says see this ah see this dirty guy look at his car how can somebody's car be this dirty nobody is abusing the car they abusing the owner so God is conscious of his reputation being at stake by your life this is why he says he said you do the right thing you serve my purpose and I will take care of the rest are you with me isn't that a good deal isn't that a fair deal you do it every day that's right you do it to your car you do it to your cloth why do you take it to the lunders the dry cleaners because it's having a purpose you are the one that knows when the when the cloth is dirty it needs some washing some ironing some because you want to look nice God can only look nice by you right amen God will be able to W off uh every insult by your life so that is why when you are serving your purpose your purpose is what blesses you is what keeps you holy it what keeps you clean is what keeps you provided for it what keeps you maintained and let me add this to it is what keeps you alive right it is your purpose that preserves you that is why the prophet said nothing can take us until our purpose is complete the day this microphone refus to function again and we take it for repair and the technician tells us nothing can be done for it that is the day it dies in our church we're going to do what throw it away if you keep it as a relic of what we have used before it will be under one chair in the artics you know you know what the purpose drove him there you are alive tonight because you still have a purpose to serve praise the Lord the day your purpose is done brother Braham said for him he doesn't want to stay one more second are you with me church let us find our purpose let me close by this all the things that happen in our lives they are not happening because it is brother Steve they are happening because of the purpose you are brought to serve your purpose will attract challenges and it will also attract blessings but guess what what keeps you afloat is recognizing that you are a child of purpose am the challenges that came to Joseph I think we talked a bit about him last Sunday so it becomes easy to just refund past through was it because it was Joseph it was because of his purpose God revealed that Purpose By A Dream which became a vision well interpreted but the Brethren refused to understand and by that they set to battle against their brother so what exposes Joseph to all those challenges all the way was purpose but but despite the fierceness of the challenge was he defeated Joseph was not defeated because the purpose he is to serve cannot be defeated your purpose is beyond you because it is God that Fashions a purpose if that purpose is defeated God is defeated so you yourself become the beneficiary of your purpose amen so let it give you energy every day that I cannot be defeated because the purpose of God for my life cannot be what defeated it must come to pass in the dungeon it came to pass when the Arabian Merchants came to fetch him out of the dungeon it was coming to pass when they went to P's house it was coming to pass when he came to prison it was coming to pass adversely but that was the road he was inching close to that purpose isn't it God used adversary to bring him to his purpose amen it doesn't matter the road you get there through because you are a child of purpose the Lord will preserve you and eventually Joseph became the birthright holder the provider for the family to preserve life and prosperity for his own generation isn't that what happened and that was why he told the Brethren he said you meant it for evil but you guess what all this old drama was God's Own Way of sending me am in advance to preserve your lives so when Moses understood the purpose it became easy for him to release everybody go with his song and his smile be an Israelite indeed in whom there is no gu what do you think of Moses sometimes Satan himself I told you before maybe it was here or not I said that guy is not as smart as you think he is when Moses was born he knew there's a nemesis waiting for him he just couldn't pick then you know what he said he said go kill all the firstborn all the boy all the male children in the hope that he will Target Moses the one who was sent to be the deliverer are you catching it so what exposed Moses to that danger was not because it was Moses it was because of the purpose Moses was brought to serve but as long as you are a carrier of purpose your purpose will preserve you God told Mo God told the parents of Moses if you keep him you going to lose him right now I want you to do one more thing for me I want to carry the battle to the enemy's Camp drop that boy in the river now and watch my hand you have done your beit let me take it over oh friends River N is a is a river infested with crocodile why couldn't they where were they sleeping when Moses crib was passing through the river why didn't they come out to eat up Moses purpose preservation by what purpose Miriam a sister who was waiting through the water following the crib could have been stun by a sea snake or a water snake or a crocodile why did God keep them busy elsewhere because this one is a child of purpose and nothing could tamper with him until his purpose is accomplished oh wait for it my brother my sister God guided him straight to the enemy's camp and he was welcomed by the enemy's daughter and God introduced the boy to the enemy's daughter God did not hide the identity of Moses when that lady carried him he said this is an Hebrew boy so why didn't he kill him because that was the order why did it he suffocate him or strangled him because purpose are you catching it when he saw this one he said this particular one can die I'm going to take him as my baby what was working purpose Hallelujah the purpose of God for your life for my life cannot be defeated our purpose will preserve us he will protect us our purpose will fight for us our purpose will make our life endure it could expose us to dangers but guess what because God is the owner of our purpose God being not able to be defeated that purpose cannot be defeated and we become the beneficiary of that if our purpose cannot be defeated it means we also cannot be defeated we are here friends brother Braham said in the Mage great Shing light he said we do not hold our destiny the Lord holds it yes is guiding it and he said by the grace of God we are bound to arrive so my brother you will arrive my sister you will arrive you all are children of purpose stop beating about the bush ask the Lord tonight Lord why am I here what am I called to serve if you can find that and dwell in it Friends when the time rolls back into eternity you will come up in the first amen if you are here till he comes you will have a body change yes the Rapture will be yours the wedding supper will be yours the Millennium will be yours and when eternity Rose in you will live in the capital of the new Earth the Lord bless you Shalom amen praise the Lord enjoy the word tonight
