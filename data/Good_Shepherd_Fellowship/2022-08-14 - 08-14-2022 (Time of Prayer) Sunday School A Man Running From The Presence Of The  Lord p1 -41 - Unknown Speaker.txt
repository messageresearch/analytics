========================================

[Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so do so so so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you're the lord's lambs that he's let me feed and i trust that it'll it'll if he'll let me do that we're going on down the road about this marriage in divorce i wanted to speak on it ever since the time of those seven seals you know the myth all mysteries are supposed to be made known in them opening them seven seals all mysteries of the bible now i'm thinking now getting kind of old i i think i thought a better at least put it on tape whether something happened to me then the church might wonder wonder what he had on his mind what would he say and all those subjects that seems to be so hard i think by the lord's help i'm going to try to bring him to you and then then if something happens if i happen to go before he comes you you'll have it on record then i think we got some new books out i see sister available over a doctor sure or not is he here a sister vail um he's probably in a meeting i don't see him but oh yes way in the bank and um brother vale has wrote a book and it's uh i thought i believe he said today too brother bale is that right you have two here now two books now i don't know i way i understand that each person gets a copy so i if you that's why i understand i may be wrong in that and then the seven church ages has been finished is that right brother veil and on print now and i know you'll want to get them because they answer a lot of questions that's been in your hearts and then after that well we're gonna try to get the seven seals open you know in the book so that each one can read and form if they that they want to can understand and study i think when it's rolled out if it first we took it right off of the tape the way it was written or spoken you know you can preach a sermon it's one thing and then write a book is another see like i'd happen to touch on a subject like i'd say to you you'd understand i'd say now the serpent seed well now the reader of that book if you tuck it off and wonder what is the serpent see and they wouldn't know that happened to go into such a place like princeton or somewhere and they think we were unintelligent people so i got brother vail to kind of help me with this and keep the line of the same thought and give it grammar and i'm sure my remember that it would be a mystery to him sure enough so uh the brother vail is really good on that so he's as uh and then in that i think our precious brother must have picked up a little extra inspiration somehow and he said he was going to write a couple of books of his own off of him like and so he wrote one call i believe a 20th century prophet and another uh ladies see a church i believe or something like that and billy told me that night that i believe several thousand of them arrived today somebody brought them from texas and um so they'll be here and they'll announce it i think whatever they are i think they're sponsored i'm not sure if they are they'll be given away to you see to free and we hope you enjoy it and if you do shake brother bale's hand back there and tell him how much you appreciate i've never read it myself if i'd read them i might change my mind about that so i'll try to read them this week while i got a chance if i can now being wednesday night our meeting officially begins tomorrow night but i i think in being here among you i i just couldn't stay up there at the house and and know that you all were down here i just like you know like some of your kin folks come in you know when you run down to the end of the lane to meet him you know and and uh i thought i'd just run down and welcome you to jeffersonville and um so this last week i was about no i beg your partner about three weeks ago i come home i've been uh out trying to been on some meetings through arizona there and i come back to try to relax and i went on a hunting trip and i got the arizona state record line i run him through 20 miles of timber to get him but then the thinker that i never thought when i was a little boy just to show how these things happen a little place that the lord has given us up there for the months that we're out there in the school for the kids i was a little boy i guess jimmy pools here tonight maybe he's dad's your big gym we went to school together and i remember sitting there as a little ragged kid and shoes tennis shoes on toes out of them borrow a piece of paper from one a pencil from another i used to write poetry and mrs wood sure had me to recite that this afternoon on tape about my old ford you know and it's three it's so good uh she said we ought to send that to mr ford i said there's too much truth about a rattling a front and a grind in a rear and a chinese puzzle for a steering gear but it's uh but i've always said the only thing i had to do is count four tars and shake it enough to get it to start and then get in it i said it was good when i'd start up the hill with it and score pulling real slow saying i think i can i think i can i think i can let's start to decide i thought i could i thought that's the way we pull this hill like uh pilgrim's progress um so we i had a little poem i wrote something like this and said uh i just think i was only about 12 years old and standing up there today looking up that canyon and thinking that lion will be sitting right here in this den room looking out the window in a glass window i was thinking of a little poem i went back and picked it up something like this just think how god do you believe god's an all inspiration god has to write a song you believe god's in songs jesus said so he referred back to david don't you know what david said in the psalms you know it's not look at the very crucifixion david sang it and the 22nd psalm my god my god wise thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierce my hands and my feet you know and that was a song thumbs is a song and in this poetry just watch height come to pass sitting there a little kid with a barred sheet of paper i said i am lonesome oh so lonesome far that far away southwest where the shadows fall the deepest over the mountain crest i can see a lurking coyote all around the purple haze i can hear a lobo hollering down where the longhorns graze and somewhere up a canyon i can hear a lion whine in that far off catalina mountains at the arizona line 40 years later i'm sitting right there at that canyon that line look at me in the face oh god there's a land beyond the river somewhere friends it's just it's got to be there see this there's too much speaking of it all these things are not just myths they are they're real they're realities i'm so glad to be here tonight to be with these people that i'm expecting to live over there forever with or there'll be more sickness or death there are separations and travel will be nothing to a sin now i think no meeting is complete without reading the word and having a little brother neville i just walked up here billy said you want me to speak with that right hey man maybe take a little too much for granted but uh i just felt so good about it so now you that's got songs and things you see brother neville when you go to sing and then just have it up there and have just about a half hour preliminary let's get right into these real deep messages and see what we can see the lord will do and i just trust i i believe we have truth i'm satisfied of that i believe the wheat is absolutely the shucks pulling away from it you know see i may give a little a prelude on that tomorrow night see how the shucks pulling away in the wheat but the wheat has to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen and that's what we're here for friend stay in the presence of the sun to our little group of people here the lift becomes so ripe to christ become bread on his table that's what i wanted to do and now before we approach the word after reciting poems and so forth let's pray again and we're going to take a text dear jesus help us tonight now in these few words as we wait upon thee and we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us lord tender our hearts move back all the shucks the thorns the thistles let the blessed sun shine of god falling upon the word lord and may we have such a great meeting tell there will not be an unsafe person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of god those without the baptism spirit may they receive it father may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age lord be unveiled to us and we'll see the plainness of god so that we'll know how to behave ourselves and act correct in ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the lord jesus did i read thy word tonight lord i might by a partial education be able to read in some of the words and maybe mispronounce others but lord god you alone can pull the context out of there you're the only one that can do it there's no no way for a human being to ever do it it lays in your hands lord so give to us each night them things that's hid in thy word that we might be better christians and live according to the time that we're living in as examples of christianity we asked in the name of the lord jesus amen [Music] so [Music] you
