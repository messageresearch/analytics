[0:50] swelled out like an inflated inner tube
[0:52] and they've been trying to cut them out
[0:53] for a long time or was going to and he
[0:55] wouldn't let them. Finally, he found an
[0:57] interview. THEM INTERVIEWS WE STAY RIGHT
[0:59] WITH IT TILL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG.
[1:01] And the man had no more coming.
[1:05] So the Holy SPIRIT WENT BACK DOWN TO HIS
[1:07] LIFE AND CALLED OUT SOMETHING HE DONE
[1:09] WHEN HE WAS AN ALTER boy in the Catholic
[1:11] church. He said, "That's the truth.
[1:13] That's the honest truth."
[1:15] &gt;&gt; Said, "Do you mean that was against me?"
[1:16] I said, "That's the only shadow that I
[1:18] can see in your life." WENT BACK UP AND
[1:20] TOLD THE DOCTOR SAID, "ALL RIGHT, GET
[1:22] THINGS TOGETHER NOW. WE'LL have the
[1:24] operation." The doctor said, "We'll
[1:25] check that old ticker again." AND WHEN
[1:27] HE LOOKED INTO IT, HE SAID, "YOU DON'T
[1:29] NEED THE OPERATION." AMEN.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:33] &gt;&gt; if our hearts condemn us,
[1:35] &gt;&gt; we want complete deliverance.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; We don't WANT TO BE HALFWAY CHURCH. WE
[1:40] WANT TO BE A REAL CHURCH
[1:43] &gt;&gt; or no church at all. WE WANT TO BE REAL
[1:47] CHRISTIANS OR NO CHRISTIANS AT ALL.
[1:52] We want total deliverance
[1:55] from our habits, from our sins,
[1:58] &gt;&gt; from our EVIL THINKING, FROM OUR EVIL
[2:00] DOING, FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE, WHATEVER
[2:03] WE'VE [screaming] DONE, WE WANT TOTAL
[2:05] DELIVERANCE.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; So that when people come into this
[2:10] church to be prayed for, there will be
[2:13] just this little group, MAYBE NOT OVER A
[2:15] HUNDRED OR TWO SITTING HERE, BUT THEY'LL
[2:17] BE COMPLETELY IN THE HANDS OF GOD.
[2:21] And when we pray, then God will hear
[2:23] from heaven.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; God wants somebody that he can hold in
[2:29] his hand.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody that he CAN SAY, "I GOT
[2:33] CONFIDENCE IN.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; I can send this my sick servant to the
[2:38] Brandon Tabernacle Jefferson." THAT
[2:41] GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE ONE [screaming]
[2:42] ACCORD.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Something will happen. Well, look what
[2:48] HE DOES FOR US IN THE CONDITION THAT
[2:50] WE'RE IN.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; What would he do if WE WERE ONE HEART
[2:53] AND ONE ACCORD?
[2:55] &gt;&gt; The only way we can do that is unify our
[2:58] hearts together with brotherly love.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Obey the offices of the church and THE
[3:03] PASTOR AND THE PASTOR OBEY GOD.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; THEN GOD WORKS THROUGH THE PASTOR
[3:07] THROUGH THE BOARD DOWN INTO THE CHURCH
[3:08] AND ALL TOGETHER ARE ONE unit
[3:13] &gt;&gt; to the kingdom of God.
[3:15] Then God will hear
[3:17] &gt;&gt; when we have A UNIFIED GROUP. LET
[3:19] NOTHING BOTHER YOU.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISMAYED in anything.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Now that's the kind of a person that God
[3:27] ordained to take the land.
[3:31] Moses was complete. He was a man that
[3:33] wouldn't compromise.
[3:36] If there were stews and fusses and so
[3:38] forth, he wouldn't compromise.
[3:41] That's what God wants us now. Pharaoh
[3:44] wanted to agree, said to Moses, "You all
[3:46] CAN GO.
[3:48] HOW ABOUT YOU LEAVE YOUR CHILDREN behind
[3:52] or leave SOME OF YOUR CATTLE back here?
[3:55] That's the way the devil wants a
[3:57] Christian to come.
[4:00] IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO JOIN THE
[4:01] CHURCH, BUT DON'T YOU NEVER FORGIVE
[4:03] JONES.
[4:06] IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU CAN BRING IN
[4:08] YOUR IF YOU CAN GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[4:10] GIVE UP YOUR SMOKING, your drinking,
[4:13] your lying, your stealing, your fault
[4:15] finding, backbiting. You don't have to
[4:17] give THAT UP. JUST JOIN THE CHURCH.
[4:21] But Moses wasn't a compromise.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED COMPLETE DELIVERANCE.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WE'LL NOT LEAVE ONE HOOF
[4:31] BEHIND." AMEN.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; WE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO US
[4:37] &gt;&gt; when we go to worship the Lord.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; That's the way the church ought to be.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; WE'LL TAKE RIGHTEOUSNESS. WE'LL TAKE
[4:44] HOLINESS. WE'LL TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[4:46] WE'LL TAKE A UNIFIED GROUP. WHEN WE GO
[4:49] TO the altar,
[4:51] &gt;&gt; we'll be a real group. WE'LL LEAVE
[4:54] NOTHING BEHIND. WE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; There won't be one hoof. Stay back here.
[5:01] Amen.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; You know when people can pray in such a
[5:03] way to the devil had to get in.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; That's the way Moses and his group did.
[5:08] THEY GOT OVER THERE AND GOT UNDER THE
[5:10] BLOOD.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; You notice until they got under the
[5:14] blood, there was no total deliverance.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; MOSES HIMSELF, HE WAS UNIFIED WITH GOD,
[5:22] BUT ISRAEL WASN'T. THERE STILL WAS SIN.
[5:25] AND THEY MURMURED AGAINST Moses
[5:28] &gt;&gt; and THEY SAID, "WHY? WHY DO YOU DO THIS?
[5:30] YOU BRING MORE TROUBLE UP ON US. CUZ
[5:33] PHARAOH JUST DOUBLED their tally of
[5:35] bricks and so forth. That was Moses. He
[5:38] was completely in the HANDS OF GOD.
[5:39] TOTALLY DELIVERED FROM SHEEP HURTING.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; They hurt God's sheep.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; He was totally delivered himself.
[5:49] But the people wasn't delivered because
[5:52] they were still murmuring among them.
[5:55] One night WHEN GOD ORDAINED THAT A LAMB
[5:59] SHOULD BE killed
[6:01] type of Christ AND THE BLOOD WAS DIPPED
[6:05] IN hass which is wheat common humble and
[6:09] put over the little of the door and on
[6:11] the post
[6:13] THAT'S WHEN ISRAEL BECOME COMPLETELY
[6:16] DELIVERED.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; With not a HOOF LEFT BEHIND. ALL THAT
[6:21] BELONGED TO THEM WAS DELIVERED.
[6:24] THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR LOVED ONES, AND
[6:26] EVERYTHING WAS DELIVERED. WHEN THEY
[6:28] COMPLETELY COME UNDER the blood,
[6:32] &gt;&gt; that's when the church should be
[6:34] completely delivered. When everything
[6:36] comes under the blood,
[6:38] &gt;&gt; when your sins come under the blood,
[6:40] WHEN YOU'RE SMOKING, WHEN YOU'RE
[6:41] GAMBLING, WHEN YOU'RE CHEATING, WHEN
[6:43] YOU'RE STEALING, WHEN YOU'RE LYING,
[6:46] &gt;&gt; when everything is brought under the
[6:48] blood,
[6:49] &gt;&gt; then there'll be a total deliverance.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; You wrong somebody, make it right.
[6:56] You can't bring that under the blood, it
[6:58] won't stay. You can't bring it,
[7:00] something won't let you do it. When
[7:02] yourself is completely totally brought
[7:05] under the blood, THERE WILL BE A TOTAL
[7:07] DELIVERANCE.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Then you'll have a freedom like you've
[7:11] never known before.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; When everything's brought in the blood,
[7:15] brought in submissive to the kingdom of
[7:17] God.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Then there will be a real deliverance.
[7:23] Jesus
[7:27] was completely totally man.
[7:32] He could cry like a man.
[7:35] He could eat like a man. HE COULD BE
[7:38] TIRED LIKE A MAN.
[7:40] HE WAS COMPLETELY TOTALLY man
[7:45] in his physical being.
[7:48] And in his spirit HE WAS COMPLETELY
[7:50] TOTALLY GOD.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; So he made his flesh
[7:58] submissive to the spirit that was in
[8:00] him. Amen.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; You see, he was tempted in all manners
[8:06] like we are. HE WAS MAN, NOT an angel.
[8:10] He was a man.
[8:13] He had desires AND TEMPTATIONS
[8:17] JUST LIKE WE DO. THE BIBLE SAID HE DID.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; He was a man, not an angel above
[8:23] temptation. Hebrews 1 said that he was
[8:26] uh HEBREWS 1:4 SAID HE WAS MADE LOWER
[8:29] THAN THE ANGELS.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; He was man
[8:34] COMPLETELY MAN. THAT GOD TOOK A COMPLETE
[8:37] man to BRING TOTAL DELIVERANCE.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; And he filled him with his spirit.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was in him without
[8:47] measure.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; And he was tempted like we were. And he
[8:51] was completely God. HE PROVED IT WHEN HE
[8:55] RAISED THE DEAD.
[8:57] When he stopped nature,
[9:00] the roaring seas and the mighty winds,
[9:04] when he spoke TO THE TREES AND SO FORTH,
[9:07] THEY OBEYED HIM. HE WAS GOD INSIDE.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he could have been man or he
[9:13] was man.
[9:15] But he totally AND COMPLETELY DELIVERED
[9:18] HIMSELF AS A man into THE HANDS OF GOD
[9:22] FOR THE service of God. And he is our
[9:25] example.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; We are men and women.
[9:30] WE'RE ALSO CHRISTIANS.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OF HIS ART EXAMPLE, LET US
[9:36] COMPLETELY DELIVER OURSELVES INTO THE
[9:38] HANDS OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; We might be subjects of the kingdom of
[9:43] God.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; Totally man. He was totally God.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; But he surrendered his natural parts to
[9:52] his and his physical parts and his own
[9:55] thinking AND HIS OWN DOING AND HIS OWN
[9:58] CARES. AND I DO ONLY THAT WHICH PLEASES
[10:02] THE FATHER. AMEN.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; There you're totally delivered from
[10:07] human beings.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; The priests come to him, the great man,
[10:13] and said, "Rabbi so AND SO AND TRIED TO
[10:17] BRIBE HIM into their affiliations and
[10:21] denominations,
[10:22] BUT HE WAS TOTALLY delivered because he
[10:26] trusted in God." Amen.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Did not the psalmist say,
[10:30] "Thou will deliver him for he has
[10:32] completely trusted in me."
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; I WILL DELIVER MY DARLING FROM THE DOGS
[10:39] BECAUSE HE HAS TRUSTED IN ME.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Some hour when we come to THE END OF
[10:45] LIFE'S JOURNEY,
[10:48] I want it for mine. I know you want it
[10:50] FOR YOURS.
[10:52] I WANT HIM TO SAY, "I'LL DELIVER HIM OUT
[10:55] THE JAWS OF DEATH."
[10:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; FOR he's trusted in me.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; I WILL DELIVER HIM FROM THE GRAVE ON THE
[11:03] RESURRECTION MORNING. TOTALLY. DELIVER
[11:06] HIM BOTH SOUL, BODY, AND SPIRIT.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Because he has trusted in me.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; All Jesus works was complete.
[11:16] Everything was complete. Total
[11:19] delivered. He totally delivered
[11:23] the leper from leprosy. He totally
[11:26] delivered the woman with a blood issue
[11:28] from her issue.
[11:30] HE TOTALLY DELIVERED THE WORLD FROM SIN
[11:33] WHEN HE DIED AT THE DAY OF THE
[11:36] ATONEMENT.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; HE TOTALLY DELIVERED EVERY SIN.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; He delivered THE CHURCH.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO LIVE
[11:46] UNDERPRIVILEGED PEOPLE.
[11:48] THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO LIVE IN A
[11:50] DEFEATED STATE BECAUSE HE DEFEATED THE
[11:53] DEVIL
[11:55] &gt;&gt; AND TOOK ALL THE PRINCIPALITIES AND
[11:57] POWERS AND SUBDUED THEM UNDER HIS FEET
[12:00] AND THEY HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS TO RULE
[12:02] OVER YOU.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; We are CHRISTIANS
[12:06] &gt;&gt; FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; We don't have TO DICT THE DEVIL dictate
[12:11] to us.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Christ delivered us total deliver us.
[12:16] delivered us from evil, delivered us
[12:18] from sin, delivered us from habits,
[12:20] delivered us from talking, delivered us
[12:22] from black guard, delivered us from ALL
[12:24] KINDS OF SMUTTY THINGS. HE TOTALLY
[12:28] DELIVERED US AND PUT US INTO HIS HOLY
[12:30] HANDS.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; A complete total deliverance.
[12:36] He delivered our sickness.
[12:39] He delivered US FROM SICKNESS.
[12:42] FOR WE HAVE AN ABSTRACT DEED TO THAT.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; FOR HE WAS WOUNDED FOR OUR
[12:51] TRANSGRESSIONS, WITH HIS STRIPES WE WERE
[12:53] HEALED.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; He is our healer.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; That's why that poor little polio WOMAN
[13:00] TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF A CANCER DYING
[13:02] HUSBAND.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; She walked into the rims in THE PRESENCE
[13:06] OF GOD. SHE HAD FAITH AND SHE THE
[13:10] DOCTORS HAD DONE ALL they could do. So
[13:12] she followed
[13:14] God's instructions and was totally
[13:17] delivered.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; The disciples had total deliverance.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely total deliverance. WHY?
[13:28] BECAUSE THEY WERE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY
[13:31] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:35] when you just a church member and shuck
[13:37] the pastor's hands or some had some kind
[13:39] of a little experience the jumping
[13:41] shouting or speaking in tongues or
[13:42] something other and still have malice in
[13:44] your heart strange acts telling lies
[13:48] smoking cigarettes lusting after women
[13:52] there's something hasn't happened yet
[13:56] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG FOR HE THAT
[13:58] LOVES THE WORLD OR THE THINGS OF THE
[14:00] WORLD THE LOVE OF God's not
[14:02] &gt;&gt; you've been misled led by their fruit
[14:05] you shall know them.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; We all want to be unified together with
[14:10] the Holy Spirit. Every member should be
[14:13] unified one with the other. The love of
[14:16] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[14:18] Holy Ghost. It cleanses us from all
[14:20] unrighteousness.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; We are delivered from the things of the
[14:24] world.
[14:26] Jesus said, "This will all men know that
[14:28] you're my disciples when you got love
[14:31] one for the other. When one member loves
[14:34] the other member so MUCH THAT THEY WOULD
[14:35] DIE for it. When one evil thing starts
[14:38] the outside world, some of the women
[14:40] come along and say, "Now look dear, it
[14:42] would be better for you if you did this
[14:43] or do that, wore this or did that or
[14:46] done this and got away in that bunch of
[14:47] holy rollers or so forth like that. WE
[14:49] ARE SO UNIFIED WITH BLOOD."
[14:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Brown, it's an
[14:54] awful temptation." BUT CHRIST DIED FOR
[14:57] THAT PURPOSE. The devil is defeated.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:02] WE WANT TOTAL DELIVERANCE.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; We want a church that's pure and clean
[15:06] AND UNADULTERATED AND WASHED IN THE
[15:09] BLOOD AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[15:12] AND SIGNS AND wonders and miracles.
[15:15] Deliver everyone.
[15:20] Dear God,
[15:24] you don't take things unless it's
[15:26] totally delivered.
[15:29] YOU CANNOT RECEIVE A SACRIFICE WITH a
[15:31] blemish on it.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; You would never receive a prayer
[15:36] &gt;&gt; that there's sin back in the life of
[15:38] that person.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; You just could not do it. Lord, you
[15:42] didn't do it. The ages gone by and you
[15:44] can't do it today.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; But the sacrifice must be without
[15:51] blemish.
[15:54] Lord God, AS WE LAY OURSELVES ON THE
[15:57] ALTAR,
[16:00] &gt;&gt; A SACRIFICE LIFE,
[16:03] take from us, oh Lord,
[16:05] &gt;&gt; all blemishes of sin,
[16:09] &gt;&gt; I completely lay my soul AND MY BODY AND
[16:14] MY STRENGTH and my efforts with this
[16:16] church this morning on the altar.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; Cleanse us by thy blood.
[16:22] AMEN.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; AND FORGIVE US OF EVERY SIN THAT WE HAVE
[16:27] DID.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; And may the great Holy Spirit so richly
[16:32] abide in us in his presence go with us
[16:34] from this tabernacle this morning.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; That we'll know within ourselves
[16:39] &gt;&gt; that he has forgiven us.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; And the prayer will be forgive us our
[16:45] trespasses as we forgive those who
[16:47] trespass against us.
[16:51] Grant it, Lord, be thou near us now.
[16:55] Bless us and keep us until we meet again
[16:58] at the evening service. May we come in
[17:01] with clean hands and a pure heart that
[17:05] you'll not turn down. For we want a
[17:08] complete and total deliverance from
[17:10] anything, Lord, that would keep us from
[17:13] being the light of the world. A candle
[17:18] that's set on a hill,
[17:20] not a bush alone, but a candle that sets
[17:24] on the hill that gives light
[17:27] to guide people's feet in the way that's
[17:30] right.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Father. We ask that in Jesus
[17:34] name and for his glory. Amen.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:48] I'm going to ask Doc,
[17:51] I think he's back there, one of the
[17:53] deacons is present
[17:55] that the church might read. Doc, come
[17:58] put this on the bulletin board so the
[17:59] church can see this to go out and then
[18:03] brother Collins if he's sure is brother
[18:05] Collins then give him his other and
[18:09] we'll see what
[18:26] had someone wanting an interview. That's
[18:29] always granted. Uh we are glad and I
[18:33] have interviews. You see, the thing you
[18:35] do is call our number out there. We we
[18:38] had so much trouble up the house. The
[18:40] church knows that this isn't strangers.
[18:42] Um the church knows about it. There
[18:45] should be a little piece. I'll have it
[18:47] placed here in the church too for
[18:49] homecomers. You see, there's so many
[18:51] that we can't take care of them all just
[18:53] as they come by number. And we and if
[18:56] you'll just call Butler 21519
[19:00] Butler and any of the members that sees
[19:03] anyone that wants I'm always glad to see
[19:05] people but we have a regular system as
[19:07] some already called several see and we
[19:09] just come by one by one as we come down
[19:12] used to be we just had kind of a
[19:13] halfhazard hit anyway skip hop people
[19:17] went home disappointed and everything
[19:18] now they have everything just in order
[19:21] and that's what we're trying to speak up
[19:23] now see everything in order just
[19:26] perfectly. I'll be glad to see this dear
[19:28] party if they'll just call Butler
[19:30] 215191519
[19:33] and Mr. Mercer or Mr. Goldwan will
[19:36] answer the phone and tell you just
[19:38] exactly when you can have an
[19:39] appointment. We got a place out there
[19:41] airond conditioned and ready to receive
[19:43] the people and pray for them. We're only
[19:45] happy to do it. Now, the reason I don't
[19:47] come to church that people thinks I try
[19:48] to get away from the people. It isn't.
[19:50] I'm trying to to be exactly in order.
[19:53] See that's what I want to be. Just won't
[19:55] show respect the person each person
[19:57] anybody anywhere anytime. See color
[20:00] creed has nothing to do with it. We come
[20:02] right there and meet the people and if
[20:04] they have a need we stay right with God
[20:06] until it's solved. If they want to know
[20:08] anything about meetings of course we
[20:10] take care of it and follow it. That's
[20:11] only the leading of the Holy Spirit. And
[20:12] that's that way I think it's just it
[20:14] does everyone just exactly the same.
[20:17] Therefore there's no respected person.
[20:18] No respect. Was there any peoples that
[20:20] come to be prayed for this morning that
[20:21] was sick and want to be prayed for? All
[20:24] right, there's not. Then let's sing a
[20:27] good song for the for worship. What can
[20:29] we sing this morning? What can take away
[20:32] my sin? You know what, Teddy? Nothing
[20:35] but the blood of Jesus. What can
[20:47] &gt;&gt; you pray for her now?
[20:50] I'm going to pray for that lady. Lay
[20:52] hands on this woman here. Would you bow
[20:53] your heads with me right? Dear God,
[20:57] there's a lady that's very sick. Our
[20:59] sister has her body even to take cancer
[21:03] from other
[21:05] standing to preach for us. But you
[21:08] deliver her from that
[21:10] few days ago when those things were
[21:13] known. Just let her find it out herself.
[21:15] Lord, she'll know that it comes to you.
[21:18] I lay my hands up on her and ask for
[21:20] mercy for that other woman.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; May the grace of God, the power of the
[21:26] Holy Ghost,
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; There any evil in our hearts, Lord,
[21:30] reveal it to us first and we will.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; That we know that we have favor with
[21:36] God, we have peace with God, we get what
[21:38] we ask for because we have no
[21:40] condemnation.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Lord in Jesus name, my friend.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:49] All right.
[21:58] But the blood [singing] of Jesus.
[22:03] Oh,
[22:08] nothing but the blood of [singing]
[22:11] Jesus.
[22:14] over
[22:17] his
[22:21] face
[22:23] white as snow.
[22:26] No
[22:28] other
[22:34] blood.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; How many feels that all your sins are
[22:40] under the blood? Let's sing it with our
[22:41] hands on
