[43:28] they just read verse 22
[43:47] okay let's just let's drop back a little
[43:50] bit just for the scripture reading we
[43:53] read from verse 19 then answered Jesus
[43:56] and said unto them verily verily I say
[43:59] unto you say John chapter five reading
[44:02] from verse 19 verily verily I say unto
[44:04] you the son can do nothing of himself
[44:08] but what he's hearing the father do for
[44:15] what things soever he does this also
[44:20] does the son likewise for the father
[44:23] loveth the son and show him all things
[44:27] that himself do it and he will show him
[44:33] greater works than these that ye may
[44:38] Marvel for as the father raised up the
[44:42] dead in the time of Elisha and in the
[44:46] Old Testament and quickened him even so
[44:50] the son quickeneth whom he will for the
[44:56] father George had no man but have
[44:59] committed all judgment unto the son Amy
[45:05] let's pray Heavenly Father father of
[45:12] creation the father of the universe the
[45:19] one from whom all things were written
[45:22] either from you are the very beginning
[45:25] of the beginning
[45:27] dear Lord we bring our hearts to you
[45:30] tonight and father we want to actually
[45:34] would take from our heart Lord a burning
[45:38] of your word
[45:40] let it be father your touch tonight Oh
[45:43] God
[45:44] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[45:46] father to be able to bring your word to
[45:50] your people we ask the Lord you would
[45:53] just bless this portion of the service
[45:55] now in Jesus name we pray
[45:58] Amy praise the Lord the Lord bless you
[46:02] you may have your seat and like we said
[46:08] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[46:09] and just thinking about the service
[46:19] tonight I couldn't help but also think
[46:23] this morning after we got praying and we
[46:27] were just fellowship in a little bit and
[46:30] talking to the family at home you know
[46:34] trying to remember some of survivors of
[46:43] the Holocaust
[46:44] you know remember some of their stories
[46:48] and some of their testimony
[46:49] and as I started to play back in my mind
[46:54] for some for some reason a period of
[46:57] time I just went through listening in to
[46:59] different survivors and they were they
[47:04] were very helpful to me to see what God
[47:08] took some of those people true and then
[47:11] I thought about it and and one of the
[47:14] thing that was real to me was most of
[47:17] the survivors every time they talk they
[47:20] tell their testimony and they would talk
[47:22] a little bit about their family what it
[47:24] was at home how their family life was
[47:27] and in the time they spend with their
[47:30] mom and the time they spend with their
[47:32] dad and you know and and every one of
[47:38] them
[47:38] one thing that was common every one of
[47:41] them
[47:42] remember the very day they were taken
[47:45] from their home every one of them
[47:47] remember what happened at that time for
[47:51] them to go right into their testimony of
[47:55] the different things that happened to
[47:57] them they will always remember what
[47:59] happened that day and you see that was
[48:02] not thinking about this until 2:00 this
[48:05] morning but for some reason yesterday I
[48:08] felt in my heart to send out the text
[48:10] that I sent out yesterday
[48:12] nourishing us you know now to get allow
[48:17] the negative part of all of this that is
[48:19] happening to get on us oh I'm feeling
[48:22] bored I'm staying to the house I'm doing
[48:24] nothing
[48:25] the children are burning me out in order
[48:27] Death Wish of course all of those things
[48:31] are happening but we have to realize
[48:33] that if you know God in all of his
[48:39] sovereign knowledge knew that we would
[48:41] come right to this hour and I believe
[48:44] that God half he has a purpose of
[48:47] bringing us to this hour now so I was
[48:51] just thinking about there and I thought
[48:53] about this code into Exeter where
[48:58] brother Branham talks about the tender
[49:00] hand of Jehovah I want to read there
[49:02] tonight before I get into what I want to
[49:05] share with you the message to Exeter he
[49:08] says I'm looking am by faith to was
[49:13] becoming something Lord upon the earth
[49:17] that's going to draw thy people together
[49:21] you know over and over brother Branham
[49:24] says Jesus in my ends in John chapter 7
[49:28] 17 say father
[49:30] make us one that the word you know that
[49:34] you have sent your son brother Branham
[49:36] says it was God it was Jesus asking the
[49:39] father to make us one and and and God
[49:43] has a way of drawing his people together
[49:50] he says by faith who was becoming
[49:55] something law upon the earth that's
[49:58] going to draw the people to get him when
[50:01] we see the denominational churches so
[50:03] pinning down and and getting so
[50:06] indifferent it's really pushes the
[50:11] people out just as it was in Egypt a
[50:15] pharaoh rising who knew not Joseph as it
[50:21] was in Germany up into Russia and Italy
[50:26] the people rise up Joseph Hitler
[50:30] standing Mussolini who hated the Jews
[50:35] they had to go back to their homeland
[50:41] now we have to realize scriptural part
[50:46] in the times all in the Bible for Jacob
[50:48] to go back to his homeland God had to
[50:51] create some unrest around him he had to
[50:56] bring him problem with with living and
[50:58] all of that I mean he was settling down
[51:00] he was prospering but God had to tear
[51:03] his nest his comfort zone to be able to
[51:07] stir his heart up to desire to go back
[51:10] to his homeland
[51:13] verbum says here they had to go back to
[51:16] their homeland
[51:18] God you got a way of doing things that
[51:23] we don't understand and you passed him
[51:30] no home in Germany everything taking
[51:33] away from them also in Italy Russia no
[51:37] place to go and they were sent back to
[51:41] their homeland just to fulfill the word
[51:46] and I believe that this thing will bring
[51:49] the Word of God to pass amen this will
[51:55] bring the Word of God to pass all the
[51:59] loving hand of Jehovah how sometimes a
[52:04] lost cruller
[52:07] the way that people suffer but it still
[52:12] is the tender hand of Jehovah leading
[52:17] his little children praise the Lord I
[52:22] mean so we have to look for the hand of
[52:26] God even if it is small you know like
[52:29] like Elijah saw in the clouds you know
[52:32] if we can see just a little bit of God
[52:35] hand in what is happening
[52:40] because in the midst of all of this his
[52:43] tender him will lead us home
[52:45] praise the Lord amen and also an in the
[52:52] message here see shall not be heard 1955
[52:58] he also said he said if you don't know
[53:01] the Word of God and the plan of God you
[53:06] you can be easily shocked but when you
[53:12] see God's plan his program then by faith
[53:18] you know it is God and God identifying
[53:23] himself doing just what he did in the
[53:28] other times walking proving he says
[53:32] that's the reason Moses could not be
[53:34] shocked
[53:35] he talked face to face with God and God
[53:40] told him I am I am the one that was with
[53:47] Abraham back yonder I am the one that
[53:50] made this promise I will be with you how
[53:55] are you going to stop that man then when
[53:59] God gave us a promise that he will never
[54:02] leave us he will never forsake us
[54:05] praise the Lord and that's what I want
[54:08] to encourage us tonight in the mists of
[54:11] all of this let's look for the tender
[54:14] hand of Jehovah amen
[54:15] because just like that hand the same way
[54:18] it lead Israa back to the promised land
[54:21] pressure from from from from farad a new
[54:25] net Joseph's pressure from from from the
[54:28] Egyptian to get them back to the
[54:30] promised land and God repeated the same
[54:32] thing he just I mean put a heat ray in
[54:36] the hearts of of a Edler and all of
[54:41] these men to put pressure on the Jews
[54:43] who get them back to their promised land
[54:45] and he would do the same amen but that's
[54:49] the tender hands of Jehovah praise the
[54:52] Lord
[54:53] let's look for the tender hints of
[54:54] Jehovah tonight I want to speak a little
[54:57] bit like I said continuing on all power
[54:59] is giving them to me but we read the
[55:03] verse over there in st. John the father
[55:06] Josh and no man but have committed all
[55:10] judgment to the son first King chapter 2
[55:16] first King chapter 2 let's see you type
[55:19] in the Old Testament were the father
[55:24] George and no man but he have committed
[55:27] all judgment unto the son
[55:31] praise the Lord amen
[55:35] I was going to have brother Jordan play
[55:40] this for us but I never told him so
[55:42] let's just read together year now the
[55:46] days of David reading from verse 1 now
[55:48] the days of David ro9 that he should die
[55:52] and he charged Solomon his son saying I
[55:56] go the way of all the earth be they are
[56:01] strong their fault and showed herself a
[56:04] man and keep the charge of the LORD thy
[56:08] God to walk in his ways to keep his
[56:12] statutes and his commandment and his
[56:15] judgment and his testimony as it is
[56:18] written in the Lord of Moses that thou
[56:22] may a prosper in all the doubters and
[56:26] words whoever they are turn it ourselves
[56:28] that the law may continue his word which
[56:34] he speak concerning me in saying if that
[56:37] children take heed to their ways to walk
[56:40] before me in truth with all their heart
[56:45] and with all their soul their Shah
[56:47] naphtha will be he said a man on the
[56:52] throne of Israel moreover thou know'st
[56:55] it also what dropped the son of suryya
[57:00] be to me and what he did tall
[57:06] the two captains of the horse of Israel
[57:09] on to Abner the son of Nell and on to a
[57:14] messiah the son of Jada whom he slayed
[57:18] and in ensure the blood of war in peace
[57:24] and put the blood of war upon his gather
[57:29] that was about his limbs and in his
[57:33] shoes that were on his feet do therefore
[57:38] I call him to their wisdom and let net
[57:43] his herd head go down to the grave in
[57:47] peace but show kindness unto the son of
[57:52] bar dealer the Ghibli and let them be to
[57:58] those that eat at the table for soul
[58:04] became to me when I fled before when I
[58:09] fled because of Absalom that brother and
[58:12] behold that their high will be shemail
[58:17] the son of Zera the Benjamite now as we
[58:22] read this these were David last words
[58:25] just like Jesus last word to the church
[58:29] all power in heaven and earth is given
[58:32] unto me so here David is is is is it's
[58:38] empowering his son how he can be the man
[58:41] and how he can be prosperous before the
[58:44] Lord the things that he needs to do and
[58:47] in keeping the commandments of the Lord
[58:49] and walking right that the promise that
[58:52] was given to his father David will fall
[58:54] upon him but after telling him in
[58:57] charging him and giving him the word of
[58:59] the law David also now is remembering he
[59:04] also committing judgment in the hands of
[59:07] Saul I mean in the hands of Solomon his
[59:10] son talking about job and talking about
[59:14] she melon and
[59:16] people that did wrong to him and also
[59:19] people that were kind to him and he's
[59:21] your empowering Solomon that a Solomon
[59:26] will be able to judge this man according
[59:29] to the wisdom that was given to him
[59:31] never been said in the message
[59:34] Revelation chapter 4 he said the father
[59:38] George had no man but he commit all
[59:41] judgment told the Sun God's judgment
[59:46] seat you speak against me it will be
[59:53] forgiven you speak another another one
[59:58] coming another mercy you can speak
[1:00:04] against the son of man and I will
[1:00:07] forgive you but some days the Holy
[1:00:10] Spirit will come and dwell in the heart
[1:00:13] of the people one word against it will
[1:00:19] never be forgiving praise the Lord
[1:00:22] now you have to realize also in the type
[1:00:25] year in in the scripture David is
[1:00:29] telling Solomon he's charging Solomon
[1:00:31] and intolerance Solomon remember joy you
[1:00:34] know what what he did to the two
[1:00:36] captains of Israel remember this one
[1:00:38] also and remember this man but well
[1:00:41] watch here in the scripture David is
[1:00:43] telling Solomon he said dude therefore I
[1:00:48] call him told that wisdom he's giving
[1:00:52] Solomon a charge but he's also telling
[1:00:56] Solomon that he should have this sermon
[1:00:59] praise the Lord
[1:01:00] and if you read the scripture you will
[1:01:02] realize that Solomon just never left
[1:01:05] from before David and said well you sent
[1:01:08] for joy I'm going to execute him and you
[1:01:11] sent for this man all of this man that
[1:01:15] David charged Solomon to remember or to
[1:01:18] deal with them all to reward them
[1:01:21] Solomon also gave him a time for them to
[1:01:25] be able to prove himself he really did
[1:01:29] not
[1:01:30] walk on the words of David and hangjo up
[1:01:34] he got into contact with Joe up
[1:01:38] he gave Joe up an instruction to do the
[1:01:41] same thing he did to she Marilyn and all
[1:01:43] of this man so what I was saying tonight
[1:01:46] Jesus said all power in heaven and earth
[1:01:50] is given unto me now we know that
[1:01:53] brother Branham the Prophet is is an
[1:01:56] interpreter of the word a divine
[1:01:58] interpreter of the world but just look
[1:02:00] at some few culture and see how how he
[1:02:03] interpreted the scripture in speaking
[1:02:05] about it what does take to make
[1:02:10] Christian life 1957 he says you he said
[1:02:14] all power in heaven and earth is giving
[1:02:18] into my hand now watch here now he's
[1:02:22] reading the scripture he's commenting on
[1:02:24] it but yet he's trying to help us to see
[1:02:27] the interpretation of the word our power
[1:02:33] in heaven is giving into my hand and
[1:02:35] what God has he poured everything that
[1:02:42] God was he poured into Christ what
[1:02:48] Christ was he poured into his church the
[1:02:55] great fountains are open everywhere
[1:02:57] ready just get rid of this little easy
[1:03:03] and so far and open up your heart and
[1:03:08] say Lord Jesus move into my heart let's
[1:03:12] go back over that chord again better
[1:03:15] branimir taking their structure all
[1:03:18] power in heaven and earth is given into
[1:03:20] giving on two main he says god
[1:03:23] everything that was in God he poured
[1:03:25] into Christ all power and everything
[1:03:29] that was in Christ he pulled into the
[1:03:33] church recorded a great fountain he said
[1:03:36] is already open it's already here
[1:03:39] we don't need as
[1:03:42] one day fast to have a we don't need a
[1:03:44] forty day fast to have it it's a promise
[1:03:47] it's already here
[1:03:50] but what is what is hindering it he said
[1:03:53] get rid of those little Asians those
[1:03:58] little foxes that spoil the vine those
[1:04:01] little indifferences there's little
[1:04:04] doubt those little things that we keep
[1:04:07] allowing in our life is hammering that
[1:04:10] fountain up from flooring get rid of
[1:04:14] those little easing and so forth and
[1:04:17] open your heart and say Lord moving to
[1:04:22] my heart
[1:04:24] there's the Lord I mean in another sense
[1:04:30] you understand that brother branham here
[1:04:32] talking about all that was in God he
[1:04:36] pulled into crash and all that was sink
[1:04:39] cries he pulled into his church let's
[1:04:42] take another coat yeah we were as as we
[1:04:45] as we look at him commenting on this
[1:04:47] infallible proof of the resurrection and
[1:04:50] all power in heaven and earth is given
[1:04:53] into my hand jesus said go into the
[1:04:58] world and demonstrate these signs to the
[1:05:02] believers go into the world and preach
[1:05:04] the gospel Paul said the gospel come not
[1:05:09] only through words but making the word
[1:05:14] manifest the power and the manifestation
[1:05:19] of the Holy Spirit how far to all the
[1:05:22] world to who every creature
[1:05:24] so that all power that is given to the
[1:05:28] church is for the church to be able to
[1:05:31] manifest the word it's for the church to
[1:05:35] be able to be the written episode the
[1:05:39] Living episode of God's Word
[1:05:43] now he takes the same tour again why are
[1:05:47] people why some people can't keep
[1:05:50] victory he says there
[1:05:53] he is with all power in heaven and earth
[1:05:58] is in his hands now even one little wave
[1:06:05] can move on the ocean without he
[1:06:12] permitted not even one little wave can
[1:06:16] move on the ocean without him without
[1:06:18] him permitting it
[1:06:20] there's his power and the power and that
[1:06:28] power of that same thing working in us
[1:06:32] to make us new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:06:37] all brother
[1:06:39] there's who there's where power comes as
[1:06:44] our faith brings down our faith which is
[1:06:48] love is casted a casted away all fear we
[1:06:54] think God wouldn't keep his word when I
[1:06:57] saw the very love and grace of God then
[1:07:02] it brings him right down to us that
[1:07:06] mighty power of God beginning to work
[1:07:10] into the church love that conquers I
[1:07:14] tell you love is the most powerful thing
[1:07:19] there is in the world
[1:07:23] amen praise the Lord love the Lord with
[1:07:27] all of your heart and all of your mind
[1:07:30] and all of your soul and love your
[1:07:31] brother ask yourself all power in heaven
[1:07:36] is given unto me see what he says here
[1:07:41] again I will take this one I know
[1:07:44] nineteen system he says see it takes a
[1:07:50] crucification it takes a crushing of the
[1:07:56] flour to bring the perfume from it it
[1:08:01] takes a crossing of a life to get the
[1:08:05] best
[1:08:06] out of it that there is that's the
[1:08:11] reason Jesus her to be crutch to bring
[1:08:16] forth what he was he could not stand
[1:08:21] before the crucification and say all
[1:08:26] power in heaven and earth is given unto
[1:08:30] me he could not say that before he was
[1:08:32] crucified he could say that after he was
[1:08:36] crucified because it takes the crouching
[1:08:40] to be able to bring the perfume from it
[1:08:43] praise the Lord Amen but after the
[1:08:48] crucification he could stand and and
[1:08:51] said all power in heaven and earth is
[1:08:54] given into my hand but what did it do is
[1:08:59] taking crucification first place law is
[1:09:04] taking the crushing and the
[1:09:07] disappointing of the apostille it see it
[1:09:12] seems their Savior the one they have
[1:09:16] loved and seen him even raised him from
[1:09:20] the dead from the grave they seen him do
[1:09:23] that but Byrne says it takes a
[1:09:26] crucification and that is the thing
[1:09:29] where the church needs death has his own
[1:09:33] mystery to it
[1:09:34] it's one of the hard thing for us to
[1:09:37] itself for us to die to ourselves in
[1:09:40] things that we that is that is hindering
[1:09:43] God moving God gave his promise he don't
[1:09:46] need any Himmel workout or any hymn of a
[1:09:50] practice anything we can practice for
[1:09:52] God to be able to bring out his word to
[1:09:55] his church all he needs is for us to die
[1:10:02] to ourself and that is one of the things
[1:10:05] that is high for us to do it take a
[1:10:09] crouching
[1:10:12] encroaching hurts just like the
[1:10:17] crucification hurts and sometimes we
[1:10:21] have to crucify the thing that we love
[1:10:24] the most we have to lay it on the altar
[1:10:30] praise the Lord
[1:10:34] just listening to the message we be
[1:10:38] playing the demonology spiritual raiment
[1:10:45] and see some of the things that brother
[1:10:48] Branham is talking about there you know
[1:10:50] how I mean demon power feels so
[1:10:55] comfortable in the church in the life of
[1:10:59] the believer that's what he says in the
[1:11:01] life of Kristen's he sees demon power
[1:11:04] things that people are learning in their
[1:11:07] lives and sometimes think the world is
[1:11:10] just a human nature but those are the
[1:11:13] very things that is robbing us from the
[1:11:18] power of God all power in heaven and
[1:11:28] earth is given unto me the greatest news
[1:11:32] flash in history nineteen sister 1 just
[1:11:35] going to read through this caution and
[1:11:37] pray here tonight he says all men can
[1:11:43] now receive this this is head to the
[1:11:48] eyes of the world and foolish to them
[1:11:51] but those who are born and elected to
[1:11:55] internalise believe it we see the hour
[1:12:00] we are living in let's go forward
[1:12:03] remember in base that we have something
[1:12:07] behind us praise the Lord
[1:12:12] suburban MC is working as here and even
[1:12:18] sometimes it seems to be that you know
[1:12:22] believers are even blind to it
[1:12:26] but those that are born and elected to
[1:12:29] internal life he says we have something
[1:12:32] behind us Jesus said when he sent his
[1:12:38] disciples all power in heaven and earth
[1:12:41] is given unto me sure that's behind us
[1:12:44] what to every promise that he made
[1:12:48] because all power is given unto him the
[1:12:52] father giveth all power unto the son and
[1:12:57] everything that's in heaven every power
[1:13:01] in heaven belongs to me
[1:13:04] said Jesus and I'm with you something to
[1:13:08] back us up remembering this and we go
[1:13:13] there is something there is something
[1:13:16] behind us there is something in us there
[1:13:21] is something before us praise the Lord
[1:13:25] and that's how God equipped his church
[1:13:28] that's how he equips the believer he
[1:13:31] promised that he would never leave us
[1:13:34] never forsake us praise the Lord
[1:13:37] and I think about it a scene that I mean
[1:13:41] a time that we are in God giving us I
[1:13:44] mean opportunities for us to be able to
[1:13:48] do a shout in with God for us to be able
[1:13:51] to bring ourselves to the winepress word
[1:13:54] we can be able to identify things in our
[1:13:57] life and crucified and right there in
[1:13:59] plain and cried to God praise the Lord
[1:14:03] amen
[1:14:05] I remember the brother brother series uh
[1:14:11] I think that's brother Jesse Smith he
[1:14:13] said it accounted for I think about it
[1:14:17] all the time it's just live in my hand
[1:14:19] he says those men Peter and those
[1:14:25] disciples after Jesus left him he left
[1:14:34] them with a promise he said wait Montero
[1:14:38] you are in
[1:14:39] jiwu power he says Peter and the rest of
[1:14:43] the disciples they had to take their
[1:14:45] days off to be able to get down in the
[1:14:49] upper room to seek the face of God
[1:14:53] because they needed this this assurance
[1:14:56] in their heart for them to be able to go
[1:14:59] forth and he said now I mean for many
[1:15:05] that will have the privilege to be home
[1:15:08] you know we have this situation around
[1:15:11] us and pretty soon you know we get right
[1:15:14] into that channel of what I would say of
[1:15:21] carnality you feel the urge to go out
[1:15:25] you you want to do this and you want to
[1:15:28] do this you want to travel you want to
[1:15:29] do this and you want to get this other
[1:15:31] one done and when you have all the time
[1:15:34] then you're looking for this of what you
[1:15:36] want to rest man is just in a conflict
[1:15:39] with himself now we have this time I
[1:15:47] believe that God has a purpose in it
[1:15:49] spoken word is the original see let's
[1:15:51] take this other one where Brenham
[1:15:53] dealing with the same thought now the
[1:15:56] power of the believing Church Christ has
[1:16:01] all power in heaven and earth you
[1:16:05] believe that then what if you are in
[1:16:10] what if he's in you has Christ got all
[1:16:16] power Matthew 20:28
[1:16:19] 18 all right he is the seed word in his
[1:16:27] body and he in us becomes the C word in
[1:16:35] us all churches now the power is never
[1:16:38] mind is by his Spirit is by his promised
[1:16:43] word praise Lord if if he's in US
[1:16:50] becomes the
[1:16:52] word in us all that God was he pulled
[1:16:57] into Christ we're going right back to
[1:17:00] the first coat that we read all that God
[1:17:02] was how is it that's the C word his
[1:17:06] promise just staying on his promise
[1:17:09] having an air for pass away but his word
[1:17:12] will not pass away praise the Lord
[1:17:19] could it be our God it's looking to his
[1:17:24] church to be able to release their power
[1:17:28] that been lying in the church domain
[1:17:31] just like I said on Sunday he never
[1:17:34] needed it it's just like we don't need
[1:17:38] the Holy Ghost when we get over on the
[1:17:40] other side we need the Holy Ghost now
[1:17:44] praise the Lord
[1:17:45] amen when we get on the other side we
[1:17:48] will already be delivered we will not
[1:17:51] need deliverance there is yet that we
[1:17:53] need deliverance if we get on the other
[1:17:55] side we will not leave healing just
[1:17:57] breaking out of this body is healing in
[1:17:59] itself we need healing is right now that
[1:18:01] we need healing praise the Lord he is
[1:18:10] the C word and if he's in us then that C
[1:18:14] word is in us o that God was he poured
[1:18:18] into Christ and all Christ was he poured
[1:18:22] into his church that's the power now
[1:18:26] watch remember God Lord of reproduction
[1:18:32] remember after it kinds that's right the
[1:18:36] seed of Christ the word must come true
[1:18:40] the body it cannot come no other way the
[1:18:45] word must come through the body praise
[1:18:47] the Lord
[1:18:48] that's that's a kind of a strong
[1:18:50] statement also you cannot disconnect
[1:18:53] yourself from the body and expect to
[1:18:55] have the word you know the word must
[1:18:58] comes through the body praise the Lord
[1:19:03] you know and I mean some people
[1:19:06] taking their own individual individual
[1:19:08] walk into the rapture you know that one
[1:19:12] main scripture was was lying there for
[1:19:15] for for an inner but for this bride is
[1:19:19] going to be a many member Brian praise
[1:19:24] the Lord
[1:19:24] people want to have their individual
[1:19:26] choice there are individual ideas their
[1:19:29] individual revelation well god bless you
[1:19:31] for that but like the prophet of God
[1:19:34] says here the word comes through the
[1:19:36] body amen amen
[1:19:39] praise the Lord all power in heaven and
[1:19:43] earth is given unto me what a time that
[1:19:46] we are living in what a day you know the
[1:19:49] other day or the night I was studying I
[1:19:52] think I have a some some code here but
[1:19:54] I'm not going to read into that tonight
[1:19:56] I won't keep you long I will soon be
[1:19:58] done here I was I was I was reading and
[1:20:02] I went home to to on on the top of I was
[1:20:14] listening to the news or driving either
[1:20:17] to work or from work and then this woman
[1:20:26] she was talking about okay I have a
[1:20:28] right to you talking about all of these
[1:20:35] coronavirus and how it will affect
[1:20:39] affect let's listen to this now he sees
[1:20:43] the the coronavirus who in fact 2/3 of
[1:20:51] the globe rich research shows as the
[1:20:58] number of coronavirus cases jumped
[1:21:02] dramatically in China atop infectious
[1:21:07] disease science warned that things could
[1:21:11] get far worse 2/3 of the world's
[1:21:16] population who catch
[1:21:19] now the thing that grabbed my mind even
[1:21:25] though I was listening to the
[1:21:26] information so I went home and I decided
[1:21:28] to make a research and read what she was
[1:21:33] saying on the news because my mind was
[1:21:35] was captured and what captured my mind
[1:21:38] was the the scripture over in Revelation
[1:21:42] chapter 12 verse 4 what Bible talks
[1:21:46] about his still talking about the great
[1:21:49] dragon drew a tear part of the stars of
[1:21:53] heaven and they cast him to the earth
[1:21:57] and the dragon stood before the woman
[1:22:00] which was ready to deliver for to devour
[1:22:05] her child as soon as it was born
[1:22:09] then I started also looking at our bird
[1:22:12] brain I'm talking on that Revelation
[1:22:14] chapter 12 where he says the red dragon
[1:22:17] would pull his tail around to Ted of the
[1:22:22] stars and what he said that is the other
[1:22:27] calling I mean talking about the - Ted
[1:22:30] and here is the world I mean the news
[1:22:34] talking about 2/3 of the world
[1:22:36] population could be affected with this
[1:22:38] and then I go back to brother Blair I'm
[1:22:40] talking about all of those thousands and
[1:22:43] thousand two million demons that is pull
[1:22:45] out into the earth now what captured my
[1:22:49] mind was here is 2/3 wish of course of
[1:22:53] those times that felt and having coachy
[1:22:56] I don't have time to go into them we
[1:22:58] might take it over one of our Bible
[1:23:00] studies here and look at them and I but
[1:23:04] brother Branham Ty dad told those demons
[1:23:07] that never kept their first estees all
[1:23:11] those angels that never kept their first
[1:23:13] estees he said in question and answer he
[1:23:17] said I think there are people today that
[1:23:20] are possessed with his spirit all the
[1:23:23] spirit a part of these angelic beings
[1:23:26] spirit wish rotated off of God that
[1:23:29] never felt in the beginning and resisted
[1:23:32] that the devil lie
[1:23:33] in heaven and 2/3 of the earth is insane
[1:23:37] and more than death which to term all
[1:23:40] the angels kick out now he's taking the
[1:23:46] same measure of the angels that were
[1:23:49] deceived by this dragon the same the
[1:23:53] same measure or the same amount of those
[1:23:55] angels that were deceived by Lucifer
[1:23:58] he's also taking the same amount to type
[1:24:03] it with the demons that I counseled in
[1:24:05] the earth and he ever said that these
[1:24:08] people I mean I don't know what are they
[1:24:10] even they even have an idea of their
[1:24:12] scripture I mean that was the thing that
[1:24:15] captured my mind when when when I when I
[1:24:17] heard that on the news I said well let
[1:24:19] me go back and look at this again and
[1:24:21] and and what what what actually it is
[1:24:24] and as you as as well as who found time
[1:24:26] and looked through some of these things
[1:24:28] that blood Branham says I mean it's very
[1:24:29] very very interesting when you look at
[1:24:32] the to Ted because he even brings it
[1:24:34] back even to to the human you know
[1:24:38] brother Branham says here he says that
[1:24:40] is the same thing in in in in our body
[1:24:43] with with with our our body our spirit
[1:24:48] and our soul praise the Lord
[1:24:52] realizing that 2/3 of our being both
[1:24:57] body and spirit was born under you know
[1:25:01] in seen influenced by seen praise the
[1:25:06] Lord
[1:25:07] so I was just looking at this number of
[1:25:10] the 210 it just caught my mind like that
[1:25:15] praise the Lord but I believe that we
[1:25:21] are we are in the hour I read this and
[1:25:24] then we will close it I believe that we
[1:25:27] are in the our brother branham saying
[1:25:29] year question and answer he says all
[1:25:33] power in heaven and earth is giving into
[1:25:36] my hands and I would go with you what
[1:25:39] ever you bind on earth I would bind in
[1:25:43] heaven whatever you loose on earth I
[1:25:46] will
[1:25:46] loose in heaven all if the great holy
[1:25:50] church only recognized is power to do
[1:25:53] these things but there is so much doubt
[1:25:57] and fear and trembling wondering if it
[1:26:02] will cook it happen as long as that is
[1:26:06] this the church can never stand upright
[1:26:11] praise the Lord we have to take what
[1:26:14] God's Word says we have to be standing
[1:26:18] on his promises now honoring you know
[1:26:21] what it will happen on that if God says
[1:26:23] it that's that - it praise the Lord
[1:26:30] he says the church will never stand
[1:26:34] upright and and when every talk of fear
[1:26:38] is Vonage and the Holy Spirit is
[1:26:41] completely in control of the church then
[1:26:45] obvious are gone and that church has the
[1:26:49] power while they have everything that
[1:26:52] heaven owns behind him they are
[1:26:55] ambassadors of the Tron absolutely an
[1:26:58] ambassador of Christ has the authority
[1:27:01] and everything that Christ own belongs
[1:27:04] to that ambassador praise the Lord and
[1:27:09] he says go into go ye into all the world
[1:27:15] and you are my witnesses after the Holy
[1:27:19] Ghost has come this is what is a witness
[1:27:23] and ambassador the whole power of heaven
[1:27:28] is right in your hands all what what
[1:27:33] what do we set what is the church
[1:27:36] bearing and we said domain is because
[1:27:40] that we don't recognize these things
[1:27:44] praise the Lord
[1:27:46] amen just like we talked the woman as a
[1:27:51] tithe
[1:27:56] she's made a a week of that so very
[1:28:01] fragile but there is just so much
[1:28:05] inner strength that is in the woman you
[1:28:08] look through the scripture even in the
[1:28:10] book of Judges think about Kjell she was
[1:28:17] the one that took the nail after a
[1:28:21] beaming like rain over to to her house
[1:28:24] that's over in the book of Judges now
[1:28:27] she was the one that received him give
[1:28:30] him milk to drink and put him to sleep
[1:28:33] but yet she brought victory to Israel by
[1:28:37] her wisdom taking the nail through his
[1:28:40] head and that's how the church is we
[1:28:49] need to come on the pressure and that's
[1:28:53] how the woman is before she bring full
[1:28:56] life into the earth she comes all of
[1:28:59] that pressure of birth pains and then
[1:29:05] she I mean she I mean she just I mean
[1:29:08] she's she's beyond control she's yelling
[1:29:11] she's doing everything and before you
[1:29:13] realize she brings full life to the
[1:29:15] earth that's how the church is praise
[1:29:19] the Lord for all power is in our hands
[1:29:27] we have it here and I believe that we
[1:29:30] are in our word I mean God is going to
[1:29:35] bring us to this place water is going to
[1:29:37] take what is happening if net god is
[1:29:41] going to use this to prepare us for what
[1:29:43] is going to come but this is no time
[1:29:46] since for us to just sit around it's no
[1:29:53] time for us to just fool around this is
[1:29:57] time for us to recommit ourselves this
[1:30:02] is time for us to go back and visit our
[1:30:05] prayer life visit our convenient
[1:30:08] one-on-one convenient you just think
[1:30:10] about
[1:30:11] who ever knew who I've come to this time
[1:30:13] word I mean everybody will be sitting
[1:30:16] home praise the Lord we would not have
[1:30:25] this time of being together and I mean
[1:30:29] the the governor executive stay home
[1:30:32] order has already been passed will not
[1:30:34] be able to come to church we try to to
[1:30:37] have all the families have people come
[1:30:39] but I mean so you see all of these
[1:30:42] things I believe God is bringing us to a
[1:30:46] place and let us not just take it
[1:30:49] lightly just like I said other day we
[1:30:54] might not be you know affected with with
[1:30:58] the illness and even if one of God's
[1:31:03] child is affected with the illness God
[1:31:05] is the a healer praise the Lord Amen
[1:31:10] wish of course I believe that God is
[1:31:13] going to bring a testimony yeah you know
[1:31:15] that the greatest testimony is not that
[1:31:17] we all stay free it would be more a
[1:31:20] testimony that sit on touch one of God's
[1:31:22] children and God delivered him praise
[1:31:28] the Lord I know many of the believers
[1:31:34] sending it through the internet now not
[1:31:36] one of the and not one of the message
[1:31:38] believer is touched by this plague well
[1:31:40] it's it would not be strange to us but
[1:31:45] God is still a healer so even if one any
[1:31:50] of God's children you know contact it is
[1:31:53] exposed to a we we are still not a
[1:31:56] friend instead does not make that person
[1:32:00] a weaker believer instead let's now show
[1:32:03] that they don't have the Holy Ghost but
[1:32:06] it shows that our God is still a healer
[1:32:10] praise the Lord because all power in
[1:32:15] heaven and earth is given unto me you
[1:32:19] know Jesus said that but I believe now
[1:32:23] the brightest
[1:32:24] is the same thing I believe the bride
[1:32:26] can be able to stand before her
[1:32:29] temptations stand before her Hobbit
[1:32:31] stand before her struggle and since they
[1:32:34] turn all power in heaven and earth is
[1:32:36] given unto me and be able to face the
[1:32:39] devil on the base of that promise
[1:32:42] there are promise jesus said because of
[1:32:45] you just like I said he don't need it in
[1:32:47] heaven the church needed it here on
[1:32:51] earth all Jesus was saying is exactly
[1:32:55] what brother Branham said all that was
[1:32:58] in God he pulled into Christ and all
[1:33:03] that was in Christ he was pouring into
[1:33:05] the church that's what he declared all
[1:33:08] power in heaven and earth is given unto
[1:33:11] me that's our promise that is our
[1:33:18] promise and we have to hold to it praise
