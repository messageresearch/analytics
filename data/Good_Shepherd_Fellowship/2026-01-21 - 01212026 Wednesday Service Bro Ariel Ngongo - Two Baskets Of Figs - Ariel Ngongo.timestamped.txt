[2:51] Praise the Lord, saints.
[2:54] It's going to be in the house of the
[2:55] Lord tonight
[2:57] and uh
[3:01] be in the Wednesday night. We will
[3:04] um just have a prayer prayer meeting
[3:08] tonight. We have a few uh prayer
[3:12] requests before us. So, we want to get
[3:15] into them right away
[3:19] and then uh
[3:24] we can be able to
[3:30] change the order of the service here.
[3:34] But, uh
[3:38] we are glad to be in the house of the
[3:39] Lord. Amen.
[3:41] We are glad to be in the house of the
[3:43] Lord tonight.
[3:45] And uh and also we want to greet uh all
[3:49] our dear ones that are streaming in the
[3:52] service tonight. And uh we just
[3:55] appreciate the Lord for
[3:57] giving us this time
[4:00] that we can come together.
[4:04] Strange enough uh uh this evening. I
[4:08] just have few prayer requests streaming
[4:11] through my phone. So I just called
[4:14] brother Lawrence and told him where we
[4:16] will have a prayer meeting tonight. We
[4:18] have a lot of request and
[4:22] uh
[4:24] again we continue to just pray that the
[4:26] Lord will take complete control of the
[4:29] situation
[4:31] around our our city and then also around
[4:35] the country. So, uh, let's just take our
[4:39] Bibles tonight. We'll read
[4:43] the Psalm and then we go right into
[4:48] taking our prayer request tonight.
[5:16] The Lord has been our refuge.
[5:19] He has been our pressing help in time of
[5:22] trouble.
[5:26] Let's read Psalm
[5:28] 123.
[5:30] Psalm 123 1-3.
[5:33] We read from verse one
[5:36] and to the last verse.
[5:40] Unto thee lift I up my eyes
[5:44] thou that dwelleth in the heavens.
[5:48] Behold, as the eyes of servants look
[5:52] unto the hand of their master,
[5:56] and as the eyes of a median look, the
[6:01] meeting onto the hands of her mistress.
[6:05] So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God
[6:09] until that he have mercy upon us. Have
[6:15] mercy upon us, oh Lord. have mercy upon
[6:18] us. For we are exceedingly filled with
[6:22] contempt.
[6:23] Our soul is exceedingly filled with the
[6:27] scoring of those that are at ease and
[6:31] with the content of the pride. Amen.
[6:36] Praise the Lord. The Lord bless you. You
[6:38] may have your seat.
[6:42] The Lord bless you. You may have your
[6:44] seat. Let me take our
[6:47] for
[6:48] prayer needs that are from uh
[6:55] out of town. We want to pray tonight for
[6:58] one brother Jim James. Last year he was
[7:01] diagnosed with cancer and he went
[7:03] through surgery and treatment. He has
[7:06] done uh well and he gave glory to God.
[7:10] He went back for the check for a checkup
[7:13] a CT scan and they found a suspicious
[7:15] spot and uh suspicious spot at the
[7:19] previous site. They are now scheduled
[7:22] for the PET scan. He's scheduled for the
[7:25] PET scan and uh so uh uh this brother
[7:30] send his prayer request. He want for us
[7:32] to remember our brother, brother James.
[7:34] And uh a prayer request here from
[7:36] brother Frank Prader.
[7:38] uh
[7:41] for a young uh girl named Rosie.
[7:47] She is 13 years old and being tormented
[7:51] by by a spirit of suicide.
[7:56] Uh praying and believing for total
[8:00] deliverance from that devil. Praise the
[8:02] Lord.
[8:03] 13 years old. She's tormented with a
[8:06] spirit of taking her own life. We want
[8:09] to pray that God will just rescue her.
[8:11] We want to also pray tonight for uh her
[8:15] sister Dina Scout. Uh she is fighting a
[8:20] severe UTI
[8:22] and she's in a lot of pain right now.
[8:26] Praying that the Lord will touch her and
[8:29] clear this up. We also want to pray for
[8:32] another sister Dynette. She is very
[8:35] sick. Uh been very sick for a couple of
[8:38] weeks ago and uh
[8:49] okay, she was sick a couple of weeks ago
[8:51] and got better, but uh she's back uh
[8:55] into that illness again. And uh she's
[8:57] fighting a very v
[9:00] and sick. Uh um all is why she's still
[9:04] caring for her mom. So uh we also want
[9:09] to remember her in prayer tonight.
[9:12] Praise the Lord. And uh
[9:16] uh so those our few prayer needs from
[9:19] from uh from out of town.
[9:23] We want to remember Sister Larose and uh
[9:28] she's down with the food and she needs
[9:30] prayer. Uh Sister Annette also calling.
[9:34] She's not feeling well. We want to pray
[9:37] for Sister Annette tonight. And uh Ben
[9:41] and the family uh they had to turn back.
[9:45] I think uh they're having u by
[9:49] visibility driving up tonight. So uh
[9:52] they ask that we remember they pray. Uh
[9:57] so
[9:58] And then uh um
[10:02] I have another prayer need here. Uh
[10:05] brother brother Hillary and his family
[10:08] text in uh also sister uh Richard uh
[10:13] she's uh uh under the weather. So she's
[10:18] uh will not be in prayer tonight.
[10:21] uh Wednesday, I mean on Sunday,
[10:24] uh I got this uh prayer request through
[10:27] the mail out there. We have a little
[10:30] mailbox that is uh stuck by the by the
[10:34] door of the church
[10:36] and uh
[10:39] we have kept it there after we we put
[10:43] the mailbox by the side of the the road
[10:45] and and I've always thought to just put
[10:48] a little note on that box for people to
[10:51] drop their prayer needs, you know, if
[10:53] they come by and I was not able to do
[10:56] it, but it looks like somebody thought
[10:58] it was a good place for them for their
[11:00] prayer request. So, uh when uh brother
[11:03] Steve checked the mail, he he hand me
[11:05] this and uh on the envelope, the person
[11:09] wrote
[11:11] they said to the prayer department.
[11:15] So, I think it's a it's a special need.
[11:18] And I and I really thought about it. I
[11:21] even sent the lady a text uh to to let
[11:25] her know that we will be praying for her
[11:27] need. So she said, "Please join me in
[11:30] prayer for my children, Isaiah,
[11:34] uh,
[11:36] Natana, and Tommy.
[11:39] I'm asking God to give them a divine
[11:44] healing and set uh, set them free from
[11:48] every bondage.
[11:50] May every obstacle and attack be removed
[11:52] from their life.
[11:54] May the Lord send uh the Holy Spirit to
[11:58] heal them physically and spiritually.
[12:03] The Lord is our strength.
[12:06] I have sent
[12:08] uh
[12:10] a tense offering. That's what she said.
[12:13] Concern sister. That's what she put on
[12:16] the first mail. And then I think after
[12:19] the couple of times she wrote another
[12:22] mail again. and uh uh
[12:26] with pretty much the same uh concern,
[12:29] the same burden. Good day, brethrens.
[12:32] Please remember my sons in prayer. They
[12:36] are having some medical challenges.
[12:39] Please pray for God healing, protection,
[12:43] and grace. Thank you. Praise the Lord.
[12:47] So, let's just bow our hearts tonight.
[12:50] Let's just bow our heads tonight. We
[12:52] want to remember this dear sister. Uh we
[12:54] don't I don't know her. We don't know
[12:56] her by name, but the Lord knows her just
[12:59] like the the Lord knows all the prayer
[13:01] needs we have mentioned tonight. He
[13:04] knows uh the area in the life of all of
[13:07] these different ones to touch. Let's
[13:10] just uh bow our hearts together. And uh
[13:15] uh we we want to thank the Lord for
[13:17] bringing us together tonight. And I just
[13:19] want us to go right into praying.
[13:22] Brother, you would just play softly. And
[13:25] uh uh I just uh thank the Lord for
[13:30] giving us this opportunity that we can
[13:32] come together this Wednesday night and
[13:35] we can be able to stand in the bridge.
[13:38] We can stand in the gap. We can be able
[13:40] to lift up these knees to the Lord. all
[13:44] the prayer requests that comes through
[13:46] uh text messages and I'm I I feel so
[13:50] blessed when I get these uh uh text
[13:54] request because uh uh
[13:59] I believe that God still answer prayers.
[14:03] I know you believe the same also believe
[14:07] that God is still moving among his
[14:09] people. Maybe uh uh we
[14:14] might not have the sense of much need
[14:16] but we know that uh many are the
[14:19] afflections of the righteous. God's
[14:21] children are going through difficult
[14:23] different things and difficult things as

[44:47] Jesus Christ.

[44:57] in Eden every single night to fellowship

[45:04] that you would come visit us in a
[45:06] special way. Father, may you break the
[45:08] word in your own manner. Lord, you

[45:32] I could only touch the end of his
[45:34] garment, I'll be made whole." Father,
[45:37] Lord Jesus, it was the faith, oh God,
[45:39] that made that thing to come to pass.
[45:41] Lord God, the same way, oh God, we're
[45:42] standing as Bartameus. Oh, Father, Lord
[45:45] God, at the at the door of Jericho,
[45:47] Father, crying and says, "Son of David,

[46:46] &gt;&gt; May God bless you, saint. Uh we Open the
[46:50] book of Jeremiah. Jeremiah chapter 24.
[46:55] Jeremiah 24.
[46:59] I'll try to go fast by the grace of God.
[47:02] Just pray for me. Uh feel a little
[47:04] nervous,
[47:06] but uh we trust that the Lord will be
[47:08] able to bless us.
[47:10] Jeremiah chapter 24 verse one.
[47:16] The Bible says, "The Lord show me and
[47:18] behold two basket of figs were set
[47:20] before the temple of the Lord. After
[47:23] that,
[47:25] king of Babylon had carried away
[47:27] captive, Jeconiah, the son of Joakim,
[47:30] king of Judah, and the princes of Judah
[47:33] with the carpenters, the smith from
[47:36] Jerusalem, and had brought them to
[47:38] Babylon." Now, I want you to pay
[47:40] attention here. The Bible says, "One
[47:42] basket had very good figs, even like the
[47:45] figs that are first ripe, and the other
[47:48] basket had very naughty figs, which
[47:51] could not be eaten. They were so bad."
[47:54] Are you with me?
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Then said the Lord unto me, "Why seeest
[47:57] thou Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs, the good
[48:01] figs, very good figs, and the evil, very
[48:04] evil that cannot be eaten, they are so
[48:07] evil." Are you with me?
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And again the Lord, the word of
[48:11] the Lord came unto me, saying, "Thus
[48:14] said the Lord, the God of Israel, like
[48:17] this good figs, so will I acknowledge
[48:20] them that I carry away captive of Judah,
[48:24] &gt;&gt; whom I have sent out of this place into
[48:26] the land of the Gades, for their good,
[48:29] not for the bad." Did you notice that?
[48:33] &gt;&gt; He sent them to captivity for the good.
[48:36] Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; But for I will set my eyes upon them for
[48:41] good. I will bring them again to this
[48:44] land. I will build them and not pl pull
[48:48] them down. I will plant them and not
[48:50] plug them up. Do you see that?
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And I will give them a heart to know me
[48:56] that I am the Lord and they shall be my
[48:58] people and I will be their God for they
[49:01] shall return unto me with their whole
[49:03] heart.
[49:05] as the evil figs which cannot be eaten.
[49:08] They are so evil. Surely thus said the
[49:11] Lord, so will I give Zedekiah the king
[49:14] of Judah and the princes and the residue
[49:16] of Jerusalem that remnant remain in this
[49:20] land and them that dwell in the land of
[49:24] Egypt. I will deliver them to be removed
[49:27] into all the kingdom of the earth for
[49:30] their hurt to be repro reproach and a
[49:33] proverb and a tongue and a curse in all
[49:36] places whether uh I shall drive them. I
[49:40] will send the sword the famine the
[49:42] pestilence among them till they be
[49:45] consumed from off the land that I give
[49:48] unto them and to their fathers. Wow.
[49:52] Jeremiah uh 29:10
[49:58] Jeremiah 29 verse 10
[50:04] the Bible says for thus said the Lord
[50:07] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[50:10] Babylon I will visit you. Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Are you are you here? Amen. Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; It says, "For thus said the Lord, that
[50:17] after seven years to uh uh be
[50:19] accomplished at Babylon, I will visit
[50:22] you and perform my good word toward you
[50:25] in causing you to return to this place.
[50:29] For I know the thoughts that I think
[50:32] toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of
[50:35] peace and not of evil, to give you a
[50:39] expected end."
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[50:42] Romans chapter 8 and we're going to
[50:44] we're going to have our seat.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8:28. Uh I want all of us
[50:50] to read it together. Is that okay?
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Since we are in the house of the Lord,
[50:56] we need to say amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Uh whenever you're ready, we can say
[51:02] amen and we will start right away.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; And we know that all things work
[51:10] together for good. to them that love
[51:13] God, to them that are the call according
[51:16] to his purpose. Is that right?
[51:19] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Thank you.
[51:25] I have a little thought here I would
[51:27] like to share with you and I trust that
[51:29] it will be of a blessing. Just pray for
[51:32] me. Uh I really want to try I'll try my
[51:36] best to be very personal uh very
[51:39] intentional at the same time. Uh and and
[51:41] I know that this can be of a blessing.
[51:44] Is that right?
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you love the Lord, you feel
[51:47] like there is something to say amen, you
[51:49] say amen to the word. Is that right?
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Uh I want to speak on the two the two
[51:55] baskets of figs.
[51:59] The two baskets of figs. It might look
[52:02] like a very strange title.
[52:05] Uh and we just read it. Is that right?
[52:08] Now there is something that I want us to
[52:12] focus together here by the grace of God.
[52:14] We want to focus on the purpose of God
[52:19] because God has a purpose. How many of
[52:22] us believe that?
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Now if you read the Bible, there were
[52:27] many prophet that went before us.
[52:30] They approached the word according to
[52:32] the revelation that was given to them.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; You say amen. Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; For example, in the book of Genesis,
[52:39] Moses says in the beginning, God created
[52:42] the heaven and the earth.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; And later on, that was the light that
[52:48] was given to him. Is that right?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; But John comes, it says in the beginning
[52:53] was the word. Is that right?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; So now John is seeing a little bit
[52:59] further than Moses by seeing the logos.
[53:03] Are you with me?
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; But in this time, we were able not just
[53:09] to look at the beginning, we able to go
[53:13] back into the mind of God.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; You see, with the message what we have
[53:20] received, we're able to go back and the
[53:24] prophet will tell us what God was
[53:26] thinking.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; You see, because God want to express
[53:31] himself. Is that right? Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; So if God stay quiet, he stay silence,
[53:37] everything still remain in his mind.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; You would not know it.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; But once God decide to reveal what was
[53:44] in his thought, you come to understand
[53:48] his purpose.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Because as we are going, we want to
[53:54] understand what is the purpose of God in
[53:57] everything that is happening around us.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Do you do you agree with me? Yes.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Because if I'm doing something, I want
[54:05] to understand Lord what is happening?
[54:08] Why are you allowing these things to
[54:11] happen the way it is happening?
[54:14] &gt;&gt; You understand? So now if you have the
[54:17] mind of God, you would understand why
[54:21] God permit things the way he permits
[54:23] things.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; all the prophet of old had the knowledge
[54:28] of things, right? But they might not
[54:31] have had the full understanding of why
[54:34] God was doing things the way he was
[54:35] doing it.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; But in this time with the ministry that
[54:40] we have received, WE ABLE TO TRACE BACK
[54:43] BEYOND what God had before even anything
[54:46] was created.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; So if we able to capture those things
[54:50] that brother Venom is saying about what
[54:52] was in the back part of God's mind, then
[54:54] we can be able to understand what was
[54:56] his purpose. Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; So everything that is happening around
[55:00] us has a purpose.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham says something as an
[55:06] introduction. I wish to to to open with
[55:09] this quotation
[55:11] in the message uh the context. Brother
[55:14] Benham is praying. This is the end of
[55:17] 1962 entering into 1963. Right? Brother
[55:22] Benham is praying. It says heavenly
[55:24] father as we stand here as many thoughts
[55:28] is dying out in our heart
[55:30] &gt;&gt; and of the mistake of last year and we
[55:33] are approaching the death of 62 right
[55:37] &gt;&gt; and the birth of 63.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; It says oh God may we be one step higher
[55:45] up the ladder. Are you with me?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; It says until we can see what Jesus. Are
[55:51] you with me? Respond with me. Are you
[55:53] with me?
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; We can see what Jesus and what his
[55:57] program.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; It says, "May everyone, everyone here,
[56:01] Lord, in prayer, while the old year is
[56:04] dying, the new birth of of of a new year
[56:07] is coming, may the old man's sin and
[56:11] unbelief die out in our heart."
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; And the new birth come in with the 19
[56:16] what? 63.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; 63. and like a rushing mighty wind that
[56:21] may fill our being and make us a new
[56:24] creature in Christ.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; So in 1963 is coming the opening of the
[56:29] seal.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham want us to focus on
[56:35] Jesus Christ.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; It says may we see what Jesus Christ and
[56:41] his program.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because this this
[56:48] prayer here is very important.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; We entering into a glorious year
[56:55] &gt;&gt; that the word will be open. Brother
[56:57] says, "Let's seek Jesus Christ. We want
[57:00] to see Jesus Christ."
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; We coming to church not to see one
[57:05] another. Though it's good, but we want
[57:07] to see Jesus Christ.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; We want to see his thoughts.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; We want to see understand his purpose.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] And if we understand his purpose, then
[57:18] we'll be actually at peace to know that
[57:22] all things are working what? For good.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Not to everyone to the core.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Now I want to break that scripture just
[57:36] a little bit here
[57:39] because I don't like just statement to
[57:41] go. Let's dig a little bit into when
[57:44] Paul is speaking. It says we know, can
[57:48] you give me give me that scripture
[57:49] again? Romans chapter 8:28.
[57:52] This is addressing to the believer
[57:56] and we has to do with himself.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding?
[58:01] &gt;&gt; So Paul is a believer and he's also
[58:04] speaking on behalf of the believers.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; We know it's not a guest thing. When it
[58:10] says we know,
[58:12] &gt;&gt; it's not guessing,
[58:14] &gt;&gt; right? It's not wishing.
[58:16] It's actually settling a with
[58:19] confidence.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing here?
[58:22] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT ALL things
[58:26] &gt;&gt; literally everything in the scope of
[58:28] life,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; pleasant things, painful things,
[58:34] clear things, confusing things, sickness
[58:38] and health. Right.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Satisfaction and disappointment are part
[58:43] of this all.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; So this all if anything good happened to
[58:48] you is still part of the all.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; If something bad happened to you is
[58:53] still part of that all.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:58] So those things which it can be an
[59:01] event, it can be a circumstance,
[59:03] &gt;&gt; you can lose something, you can deal
[59:06] with a trial, you can actually deal with
[59:09] a a delay.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You can pray about something but it's
[59:12] delaying.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S PART OF THAT ALL.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; So your blessing, YOUR PROSPERITY ARE
[59:20] PART OF THAT ALL THINGS.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Now, when it says work together,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; work together, it means the good and and
[59:32] bad. Both of them are together.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I don't know if somebody's
[59:36] catching this.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER NOW. THEY'RE
[59:40] COMING AS A PACKAGE.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Because they're part of what? Of the
[59:43] all.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[59:48] the good and bad that are happening to
[59:50] us, they are made to cooperate together
[59:53] toward a an outcome,
[59:56] right?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; That God intends.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; SO ALL OF THEM TOGETHER ARE WORKING,
[1:00:03] THEY'RE WORKING together for a purpose
[1:00:07] for good means that it's going to be
[1:00:10] beneficiary to you.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Not just the good things, the bad
[1:00:15] things, too.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] they still going to be beneficiary to
[1:00:19] you.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; It will bring deepness of revelation to
[1:00:25] you.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; You would come to the understanding.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; It will bring you to a total obedience
[1:00:35] to the word of God.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; IT WILL SHAPE YOUR CHARACTER IN A
[1:00:40] CERTAIN WAY.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:42] So something that is beneficiary to you,
[1:00:44] you may not agree with it,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; but God knows better than you.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; What is good for you.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; To them that love. Jesus says, "If you
[1:00:55] love me, keep my commandments."
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Is those that their heart will be
[1:01:00] turned.
[1:01:03] Those that their heart, IT'S NOT JUST,
[1:01:06] OH, I COME to church because of this,
[1:01:08] but it's a matter of love.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:12] is those that desire to keep his
[1:01:14] commandments.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Those that longing a closer walk to God
[1:01:19] with God.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; It says the call. You cannot be called
[1:01:25] until the father draws you first. Nobody
[1:01:27] can come to me unless the father draws
[1:01:29] him first.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; But that call right
[1:01:36] according to his purpose. What is a
[1:01:39] purpose? is a reason for which something
[1:01:43] is done
[1:01:45] or created or which something exists.
[1:01:50] So everything that is on earth there is
[1:01:53] a purpose behind it.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; There is a good purpose and there's a
[1:01:58] bad purpose.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; So you can look at a a very bad person.
[1:02:05] You look at them and say, YOU KNOW WHY
[1:02:07] God brought them? They were there for a
[1:02:08] purpose.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:11] The good people on the other side also
[1:02:13] they are there for a purpose.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; The good fig and the bad figs, the
[1:02:18] naughty figs, both of them are there for
[1:02:20] a purpose.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; But now Elohim had a purpose in his
[1:02:30] mind, right?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He he he he won it. Brother Bam says
[1:02:36] something here in the word. Oh my
[1:02:37] goodness, I love this.
[1:02:39] Water baptism. Brother Benham says 1961
[1:02:42] he says as God in the beginning knew
[1:02:45] that men would fall.
[1:02:47] So God in his mind
[1:02:50] he knew that men would fall.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; God in the beginning knowed that men
[1:02:59] would fall. Therefore he put him on the
[1:03:02] free moral agency.
[1:03:04] Now saints I want you to catch this very
[1:03:06] carefully.
[1:03:09] Why God had put men on the free moral
[1:03:12] agency?
[1:03:13] The free moral agency is the ability for
[1:03:16] men to choose.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are we together?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Brother says he put men on the free
[1:03:25] agency knowing
[1:03:27] because he could display his attribute
[1:03:30] to be a father, to be a son, to be a
[1:03:34] healer, to be a savior.
[1:03:38] That's something a attribute is a
[1:03:40] thought.
[1:03:42] So God in his thoughts, he want to be a
[1:03:44] savior. He want to be a redeemer. He
[1:03:47] want to heal you. He want to save you.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HE DOES WHEN HE BRINGS men on
[1:03:53] earth, he gives Adam the free moral
[1:03:56] agency. Why did God give him the free
[1:03:58] more agency?
[1:04:01] Are you with me? Are we together? Right.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how could it save less
[1:04:05] something lost?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; And in God was the attribute before
[1:04:11] there was even was an angel or a
[1:04:14] molecule or anything. God was by himself
[1:04:18] alone. But it wasn't God because God is
[1:04:21] object of worship. There was nothing for
[1:04:23] him to worship. Nothing could worship
[1:04:26] him. But his attribute displayed
[1:04:28] something and made an angel. Then it was
[1:04:32] God.
[1:04:33] So what made God God? Because he
[1:04:36] actually created a subject to worship
[1:04:39] him.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Then he was God.
[1:04:45] Then he made men and give him free moral
[1:04:50] agency.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; He fell. So there is something here that
[1:04:57] you have to understand.
[1:04:59] When the fall happened in the garden of
[1:05:01] Eden, right, Eve was deceived. How many
[1:05:05] of us would agree with it?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; But Adam, but says Adam deliberately
[1:05:12] made the choice.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Are you are you with me?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; He willingly made the choice. How did he
[1:05:20] make the choice? Because of the freemore
[1:05:21] agency.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Are you are you are you catching the
[1:05:25] purpose of God here?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:28] So God give men the free more agency TO
[1:05:32] CHOOSE
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; BUT YET IN HIS mind he want to be a
[1:05:36] savior but there's nobody lost.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; There's nobody that you know the the
[1:05:42] fall actually pushes him to fulfill what
[1:05:46] was in his mind.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; But at that moment AS HE'S THINKING
[1:05:50] NOBODY HAD FALLEN YET. YES.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD when he creates man, he gives
[1:05:55] him the ability to choose.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; But yet in the midst of it, Adam had the
[1:06:00] mind of God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; So when Eve fell, Adam accepted to take
[1:06:07] his bride just as he was because of
[1:06:10] what? Redemption.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; That was God's character in Adam.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; So he gives him the free angely. He give
[1:06:16] him also his nature to display something
[1:06:20] later on. Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Are you Are we together?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; He fell then when he fell he becomes
[1:06:31] right
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; a savior.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So whatever was in his mind now happened
[1:06:38] because he's desiring to be that.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says in the form he took
[1:06:48] sickness
[1:06:49] so he becomes a healer.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; So all everything that was in his mind
[1:06:55] stop coming out as he desired.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; See it's displaying God attributes.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; No. That's for Adam. Let's go to Eve.
[1:07:15] You know our God does not make mistakes.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; So things that is happening in your
[1:07:21] life, there is a purpose behind it.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Now in the in the other quotes there,
[1:07:28] the invisible union,
[1:07:32] brother Bon says when you see the woman
[1:07:35] a byproduct, right? I want to really
[1:07:39] deal with this thing, right? Just for a
[1:07:42] minute here.
[1:07:44] When you see the woman, a byproduct, not
[1:07:47] another female like her made in that
[1:07:50] order, knowing, right?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; She could be what?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Deceive.
[1:07:59] God knew that Eve could be deceived.
[1:08:04] And God made her dust.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:10] Are we together?
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; God know if he did not know the end from
[1:08:18] the beginning,
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; then he wasn't God.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; If he isn't infinite, if it isn't, he
[1:08:26] can't be infinite without being what?
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; omnisient. Are you with me?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Omnipresent, knowing all things eternal.
[1:08:38] So you would tell me does the fall God
[1:08:41] knew that will happen? Yes.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Because in his mind he wanted to display
[1:08:47] what his attribute.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be a healer. He wanted to
[1:08:54] take your place. He wanted to feel what
[1:08:56] you're feeling. That's
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; But he can't do it as an eternal God as
[1:09:02] Elohim living by himself.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; So he has to come down to fulfill what?
[1:09:06] WHY WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; So if you are sick tonight, you have the
[1:09:11] right to believe in God because that was
[1:09:14] part of God's thought. That's what he
[1:09:16] wanted to be.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; It's not really ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT
[1:09:20] HIM.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; So if you need to be saved, it's not
[1:09:25] really IT'S ABOUT GOD. THAT THAT'S GOD'S
[1:09:28] BUSINESS.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; He want to be your savior.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "As believer, we must know
[1:09:36] these things."
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; It's the will of God for you to be
[1:09:40] healthy.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Not just your will. It's God's will for
[1:09:48] you to be happy.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So, he know all things and he had
[1:09:58] to to make the that uh that that woman.
[1:10:02] The man did not have a wife. The wife
[1:10:06] and the man was the same thing. He had
[1:10:08] the feminine and the masculine spirit in
[1:10:10] him. But see the attribute that in God
[1:10:17] had to be displayed. Are you with me? He
[1:10:20] was to be a savior to make everything
[1:10:24] perfect the way he had it. Are you with
[1:10:27] me?
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Then there could be nothing lost.
[1:10:33] Are we reading together?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; But there is something I want to add a
[1:10:38] little bit here. How many of us have
[1:10:39] heard the word weak vessel? Weaker
[1:10:41] vessel. Is that right? How many of us?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Let's look at it. The way God thinks of
[1:10:47] it, not the way we divi. We we we think
[1:10:50] that God is meaning it, right? Because
[1:10:53] in his purpose is the one that wanted
[1:10:56] those things to happen the way it is. He
[1:10:58] created them. D. Are you with me?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's go to first Peter 3:7.
[1:11:04] I'm not getting into marriage and
[1:11:05] divorce, but I'm bringing a thoughts
[1:11:06] there, right? So we can all understand
[1:11:10] what God really means,
[1:11:12] not what we define it to be.
[1:11:17] First Peter 3:7,
[1:11:20] likewise ye husband, dwell with them
[1:11:23] according to the knowledge given honor
[1:11:25] unto your wife, unto his wife, the wife.
[1:11:28] So the man has to honor his wife. Is
[1:11:30] that right? Is that a scripture?
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; All right. As unto the wicked vessel, as
[1:11:37] being together of the grace of life,
[1:11:40] your prayer be not hindered.
[1:11:44] So as a husband, your prayer can be
[1:11:47] hindered.
[1:11:50] Oh, is that is am I reading a different
[1:11:52] Bible? Is that a Bible? Right.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, am I reading the Bible? Right.
[1:11:56] No, but we have to say amen. It looks
[1:11:58] like I felt like I was the one saying it
[1:12:00] so it got quiet on. Likewise, he husband
[1:12:04] dwell with them according to the
[1:12:06] knowledge giving honor unto the wife
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; as unto the wicked vessel as being hes
[1:12:13] together of the grace of life that your
[1:12:16] prayers be not hindered.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; So as a husband, you can pray. God will
[1:12:21] not listen to your prayer if you're not
[1:12:22] honoring your wife.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:26] Oh yeah. I mean that's the word.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 25.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; May the Lord have mercy on us.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 1
[1:12:40] 27. Sorry. But God has chosen the things
[1:12:45] the foolish things of the world to
[1:12:47] confound the wise.
[1:12:50] God has chosen the weak things.
[1:12:54] Oh, are we are we there? 1 Corinthian
[1:12:56] chapter one.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Verse 20 25.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; You know, brother one already caught
[1:13:01] where I'm going with that.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:13:07] uh because the foolishness of God is
[1:13:11] wiser what?
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Than men,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; The foolish right of sorry, the
[1:13:20] foolishness of God is wiser than men.
[1:13:23] The weakness of God is stronger than
[1:13:27] men.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; So the weaker vessel as we define it is
[1:13:33] not according to the way us men think
[1:13:36] that weakness is
[1:13:38] because the weakness of God what seems
[1:13:41] what God qualified to be weakness
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; it's not what you think weakness is.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Am I in the word? Am I
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; oh my goodness
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; cuz sometime brother one talks about
[1:13:55] these things you know it's kind of
[1:13:57] passing but I had to address this one
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; the weakness of God is stronger than
[1:14:03] men.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; So in other word in that way weakness
[1:14:07] there is a power that is behind it.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; We but we have to understand what God is
[1:14:14] trying to say but looking at the woman
[1:14:16] and say she is the weaker vessel.
[1:14:19] Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Because God has a purpose behind.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; He had made her dust.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about the immoral
[1:14:28] women out there.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; We're talking about women that are
[1:14:31] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:32] Ghost.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So, we must know the difference here.
[1:14:41] May the Lord help us.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] 1 Corinthian chapter 20 uh 1:27.
[1:14:50] But God
[1:14:53] has chosen the foolish things of the
[1:14:56] world to confound what the wise.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And God has chosen
[1:15:02] the weak what things
[1:15:06] of the world to confound the things
[1:15:10] which are what? Mighty.
[1:15:14] Hallelujah.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; So God has a purpose in giving men the
[1:15:21] free mo agency
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; and allowed the woman to be to to be
[1:15:27] able to be deceived. Are you are you
[1:15:30] with me?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And the prophet is telling us that
[1:15:32] behind it God has a purpose.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; It is not the way we think of weakness.
[1:15:42] how it should be defined.
[1:15:44] The opening of the word comes to bring
[1:15:48] us to the the full understanding of what
[1:15:51] God is meaning.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Because the the seals are open. The
[1:15:56] opening of the seal is the opening of
[1:15:58] the entire Bible.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; So once the Bible opens is to change the
[1:16:02] way we think.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Is to change the way we approach things.
[1:16:07] YOU KNOW SOMETIME YOU feel like you know
[1:16:09] God but you can't you're not even close.
[1:16:12] There is more to know about him.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LOOK AT it in the sense of a
[1:16:18] human ability to look. But look at THE
[1:16:20] OPENING OF THE WORD.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; How God sees it after the word had been
[1:16:25] open.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Our strength,
[1:16:32] our weakness, God sees it completely
[1:16:34] different.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. our strength also. God
[1:16:37] looks at it completely different
[1:16:40] because we want to depend on his
[1:16:42] strength not our own strength.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Because the God the the strength that
[1:16:54] God is giving us should not be mixed
[1:16:58] with our own understanding of what
[1:17:00] strength means.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:02] because that will not be the origin the
[1:17:05] original meaning of that word.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; It will be mixed with something
[1:17:09] different and that's not the word.
[1:17:12] So the strength of God is for you to
[1:17:14] forsake your own ability.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; To surrender fully to him so he can take
[1:17:20] over.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But if they still have the human element
[1:17:24] in it, God cannot help it. It's a
[1:17:26] mixture.
[1:17:30] And I do believe that as we are entering
[1:17:33] into this new year, may God give us
[1:17:35] grace to seek Christ and his program.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; In the exposition church ages
[1:17:44] quote chapter uh number four. I want you
[1:17:46] to catch this again. Are you with me?
[1:17:49] You love the Lord.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right. Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; This was the part of his eternal and
[1:17:56] predestinated purpose.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; This is this plan was to be to the
[1:18:02] praises of the glory of his grace. Is
[1:18:05] that right?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; It was the plan of redemption. It was
[1:18:08] the plan of salvation. Now listen
[1:18:11] closely.
[1:18:12] Are we together? Right.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; God being a savior, it was necessary
[1:18:18] that he predestinate a man who would
[1:18:21] require salvation in order to give
[1:18:24] himself reason
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; and purpose of being.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; That is 100% correct.
[1:18:36] I like that. And multitudes of
[1:18:39] scriptures bear it out as dust. The very
[1:18:43] point verse in Romans 11:30 36 for him
[1:18:48] and through him and to him all things to
[1:18:52] whom be the glory forever. Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Men could not directly come and
[1:18:58] partakers of the tree of life in the
[1:19:00] midst of the garden.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Are you are you are you there?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one.
[1:19:08] Brother Bam says that eternal life of
[1:19:11] the eternal life of the tree had to
[1:19:14] become flesh first. Are we together?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; But God but before God could raise and
[1:19:21] save a sinner, he had to have a sinner.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; To raise and save.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Men had to fall.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Right. The fall which would be caused by
[1:19:37] Satan had to have flesh to make fall.
[1:19:42] Satan had to come through the flesh
[1:19:43] also. But Satan could not come through
[1:19:46] human flesh to make the fall as would
[1:19:49] Christ come in human flesh to restore
[1:19:52] the fall the fallen.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right?
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; But there was an animal, the serpent, so
[1:19:59] close to man that Satan could get to
[1:20:01] that beast and through that beast could
[1:20:04] get the human flesh and cause the fall
[1:20:07] and inject himself thereby into the
[1:20:10] human race.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Let's continue again.
[1:20:16] Even as Jesus would would one day come
[1:20:20] and inject himself into the human race
[1:20:23] into human body even to the extent of
[1:20:25] the of a resurrection wherein we would
[1:20:28] have bodies like unto him in his glorifi
[1:20:30] glorified one.
[1:20:32] That's what God worked out here in the
[1:20:35] garden. Are we are we reading together?
[1:20:40] That's what God worked out here in the
[1:20:43] garden was his predestinated plan.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Does it change the way we view things a
[1:20:52] little bit here? Do you see that?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; But I want you to catch this. I want you
[1:20:57] to catch this statement very carefully.
[1:21:01] Brother Benham says, "And when Satan
[1:21:05] had brought about that which was
[1:21:08] necessary
[1:21:11] to the purpose of God,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; this is powerful." Yes.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And when Satan had brought about that
[1:21:25] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:21:27] God, then men could not get to the tree
[1:21:30] of life in the garden.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; So even Satan
[1:21:35] was a tool into God's hand.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Satan had to bring about that which was
[1:21:47] necessary. Right.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; To the purpose of God.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; So in other words, Satan
[1:21:55] has also a purpose.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; So he sickness does not come from God.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; God is not the author of sickness.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Satan is the author of sickness.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS ONE thing I want to tell
[1:22:13] you tonight. If sickness get into your
[1:22:16] body is because God has allow it to
[1:22:19] happen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; It's not under the control of Satan.
[1:22:24] Let's just tell it. LET'S JUST SAY IT
[1:22:26] OPENLY.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; SATAN, you have no control over my body.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody's not hearing me. Let's repeat
[1:22:34] it together.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Satan, you have no control over my body.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to claim somebody else
[1:22:40] that is sick. Yes.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Satan, you have no control over.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Because he has to bring that which was
[1:22:53] what? Necessary.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOD.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Certainly not. It wasn't time.
[1:23:07] Jesus had to step into what? To flesh.
[1:23:10] He has to die. But Satan had to come up
[1:23:14] with all of these things. Lucifer came
[1:23:16] says, "You know what? I'm going to enter
[1:23:17] into the serpent." God is sitting there.
[1:23:19] You think he didn't know?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He knew everything.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; He knew everything. But there was a
[1:23:25] purpose there.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; We were just there playing like a drama.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; God comes. He says, "Okay, I'm the
[1:23:33] savior.
[1:23:34] I'm going to choose one to be a sinner
[1:23:39] and so that I can come and save you.
[1:23:42] It's like a big drama that God is
[1:23:44] playing.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; So once you are coming, you have to
[1:23:49] understand that you are part of that
[1:23:51] drama.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; But you struggling as a human ability.
[1:23:55] You struggle. Lord, I'm dealing with
[1:23:56] this. I'm But don't don't don't you know
[1:23:59] that you are a son and a daughter of
[1:24:01] God?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are called for a purpose. If
[1:24:05] something happened to you, you should
[1:24:07] not be sickened.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You may not understand it. Look at Job.
[1:24:15] He did not know. He was confused. This
[1:24:17] is what's going on.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; All of these things happening to me.
[1:24:22] But down there,
[1:24:25] God knew
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; that. Oh, I know what I put in that man.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm not even worried about it. says,
[1:24:32] "Satan, go touch him."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; You see the confidence that God has
[1:24:37] toward you, he knows that you will not
[1:24:39] fall.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; He knows that even if Satan throws
[1:24:43] sickness in your body, you still come
[1:24:45] out of it.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; When Satan trying to discourage you and
[1:24:49] point you to all the negativity,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; but Satan does not know that God has
[1:24:55] given you the strength to stand.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] Saints, this is not about us. It's about
[1:25:03] God.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; But what God is required of us is to
[1:25:08] trust him.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; To yield ourself to him.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; To know that God, you have a purpose
[1:25:14] behind what I'm dealing with.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Is it not the one who
[1:25:22] said in Isaiah 46:10,
[1:25:26] declaring the end from the beginning,
[1:25:28] from the ancient time, the things that
[1:25:30] are not yet done, saying, "My counsel
[1:25:34] shall stand and I will do what? All my
[1:25:37] pleasure.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; What God had intended in his mind, he
[1:25:43] will fulfill it."
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; That's his own duty.
[1:25:49] So if you were part of God, you should
[1:25:51] not worry.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; He contin says, "Calling the ravenous
[1:25:59] birds from the east and the men that
[1:26:01] executed my counsel from a far country.
[1:26:03] Yay, I have spoken it and I will also
[1:26:08] bring it to pass. I have purposed it and
[1:26:11] I will also what? Do it."
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] Whatever God thought he would do, hit
[1:26:18] it.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; But we just read in the book of
[1:26:25] Jeremiah,
[1:26:26] Jeremiah 24 verse4
[1:26:29] again. Then the word of the Lord came
[1:26:31] unto me, saying, "Thus said the Lord,
[1:26:34] the God of Israel, like this good fig,
[1:26:38] so will I acknowledge them that are
[1:26:42] carried away captive of Judah,
[1:26:47] whom I have sent
[1:26:50] out of this place into the land of the
[1:26:52] Kadis for what? Their good."
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Now, how can
[1:26:57] captivity
[1:26:59] be considered as something good?
[1:27:02] Oh my goodness.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; How can you believe a God that is
[1:27:12] telling you that I'm sending you to
[1:27:14] captivity for your good?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; But yet you're still standing here. You
[1:27:18] still believe in that God.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that his word?
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he said, right? Yes.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; But how can captivity be considered as
[1:27:30] good?
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Because he has a purpose.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; He's sending you there because he knows
[1:27:39] the end.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Before even there is a beginning.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; So he said he says, "I'm going to send
[1:27:45] you there."
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; It's literally God says, "You know what?
[1:27:48] There's an ocean. You just jump in. You
[1:27:51] don't know how to swim."
[1:27:53] You're like, "God, are you are you soon?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; You never told me how to swim."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; But it's telling you, I already know the
[1:28:03] end.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He knows that there's going to be
[1:28:07] somebody that will actually come and
[1:28:08] rescue you.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; But you will be in the water though.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Because there is a purpose.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing as God is looking at
[1:28:19] you say you're not going to die. Sure.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; But the following day,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; you get drowned.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; You are drowning under the sea.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; But you have to remember what he said.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Because what he said can never fail.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing as AS PAUL
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; IS INSIDE OF THE SHEEP. THE ANGEL MET
[1:28:40] HIM. HE SAYS, "NOT EVEN ONE soul will be
[1:28:42] lost."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; He continually says, "Because you have
[1:28:46] to go see Caesar."
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; SO IN THAT POINT WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN
[1:28:51] PAUL IS INSIDE OF THE BOAT, he's not
[1:28:53] even worry about what is happening.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; He knows that I'm going to go see
[1:28:57] Caesar.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; SO GOD MAY NOT TELL YOU WHAT IS
[1:29:01] HAPPENING IN BETWEEN, BUT HE GIVE YOU
[1:29:03] THE WORD OF WHAT WILL happen later.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; So you have to hold on to that word that
[1:29:08] he said later. Don't look at what is
[1:29:10] happening around you.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord,
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE? GOD PROMISED YOU A
[1:29:18] child
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; and the following DAY THE DOCTOR SAID
[1:29:21] YOU HAVE CANCER.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Then what do you do? You tell the devil
[1:29:28] I'm not going to die.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Because God promised me what? A child.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; I CANNOT BEAR A CHILD DEAD.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; I have to be alive.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WILL NOT DIE BECAUSE THERE
[1:29:46] IS A PROMISE.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You see, faith say you you're waiting
[1:29:52] FOR GOD TO CONDESCEND DOWN on earth.
[1:29:55] This word as that very it's the same
[1:29:58] THING AS GOD SPOKE IT TO YOU.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Every line.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; IF YOU POINT AT THE PROMISE, YOU HOLD ON
[1:30:07] to that promise.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; He will be as faithful as if he was
[1:30:12] standing in front of you telling you it.
[1:30:13] Yes.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; How can sickness be considered as a good
[1:30:28] thing?
[1:30:34] But we want to see Jesus and his program
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; in the midst of my sickness.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. In the midst of my
[1:30:42] trial, I'm stepping into this year.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; I want to see Christ in his program
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; concerning all the situation that I
[1:30:50] have. That's why when you go on your
[1:30:52] knees, you seeking the will of God.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Because you want to know what is his
[1:30:57] program.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have your own will.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; You have his will.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; John chapter 9 verse one. the healing of
[1:31:11] the man that was born blind.
[1:31:14] There's a picture there. I'm trying to
[1:31:16] have pictures so that the young people
[1:31:18] can love the young one can love that.
[1:31:21] There's a picture after that, right?
[1:31:24] Jesus healing the you know the the blind
[1:31:26] man, right? The Bible says something.
[1:31:30] Jesus passed by and there was a man
[1:31:32] which was blind from what? His birth. Is
[1:31:34] that right?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:36] And his disciple asked him saying,
[1:31:39] "Master,
[1:31:41] who did sin?
[1:31:43] This man or his parents that was born
[1:31:45] blind?"
[1:31:47] I want you to notice something. When the
[1:31:50] Bible get the record of these things is
[1:31:53] because there is somebody that will
[1:31:55] later ask the same question.
[1:31:58] Huh? There's nothing new under the sun.
[1:32:00] Right?
[1:32:01] So out of everything that you the
[1:32:03] disciple can ask the master is who sin
[1:32:09] most of the time that's what we do
[1:32:12] something happened to a brother we start
[1:32:14] imagining already oh maybe they have
[1:32:17] done this that's what the lord gave them
[1:32:19] you see sometime that's the way we think
[1:32:23] those disciple were thinking the same
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; there's nothing new under the
[1:32:31] Jesus answered, "Neither was this man
[1:32:34] seen,
[1:32:36] nor his parents, but that the works,"
[1:32:40] are you with me?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; The works of God should be what?
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Made manifest. I like the amplified
[1:32:46] version. It says, "Neither this man nor
[1:32:49] his parents sin, but he was so that the
[1:32:53] works of God might be displayed
[1:32:58] and illustrated in him.
[1:33:02] So God allowed this man to be blind for
[1:33:06] a purpose
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; because God want to show you know
[1:33:12] there's one thing saints about God about
[1:33:15] my God he likes to receive the glory
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; he likes glory you know
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; he's is a jealous God sometime
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; all the time
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; he love the glory so the only thing that
[1:33:28] you can make him feel good
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; just give him his glory
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Just stop worshiping him.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a president of a country
[1:33:39] is passing by, you just come and say
[1:33:43] that person will look at you said this
[1:33:46] this is a good a good citizen. He will
[1:33:48] give you a little bit money too.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Because people God love worship.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Just acknowledging God you you're good.
[1:33:59] You're so wonderful to me. There's no
[1:34:01] more like there's not even one.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; I I've met people, great men, but they
[1:34:06] don't have the they don't love the way
[1:34:08] you love me.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Just tell him the truth.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I was in that situation. Look at how YOU
[1:34:15] DELIVER ME. WHO ELSE CAN DO THAT?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; You start pointing OUT TO YOU START
[1:34:20] encouraging yourself in the Lord.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; The encouragement must come from within.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime we waiting for a brother
[1:34:29] to come but sometime you need to
[1:34:31] generate
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; something from within positivity.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Start confessing something positive.
[1:34:39] If you're negative that's a good start
[1:34:41] there. Just start saying good words.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do it. I'm going to be able
[1:34:46] to do it. I'm going to make it.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to die.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; You know, start confessing good because
[1:34:53] it's the high priest of what you're
[1:34:54] confessing.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Your children are going in
[1:34:57] the street, just stop confessing good
[1:34:59] things.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; They will be okay. God will help them.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the life of Joseph for a
[1:35:10] minute.
[1:35:11] If things happen is because God allow it
[1:35:13] to happen.
[1:35:15] Now, Joseph is born with a gift. Do you
[1:35:19] like You love the pictures, right?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying my best.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Joseph is loved of his parent. He's only
[1:35:25] 17.
[1:35:27] is so happy say whoa I'm having all this
[1:35:29] gift all is good
[1:35:33] Joseph comes and behind him he has
[1:35:36] brothers that is that are looking at him
[1:35:38] say and this guy what is he thinking he
[1:35:40] is
[1:35:42] you see my dad gave him the the the
[1:35:45] garment of seven colors you know and
[1:35:47] they start hating him of course Joseph
[1:35:51] is also say oh wow I mean I'm the
[1:35:53] blessed among I had a dream look at what
[1:35:55] happened in my dream. But the bread was
[1:35:58] looking like no that's not of God
[1:35:59] though. All this bread that was not the
[1:36:01] right spirit in them. They had jealousy.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Right. They had jealousy and that was
[1:36:06] wrong.
[1:36:08] And they took Joseph and threw him
[1:36:10] inside of the well something a sister.
[1:36:13] But I want you to understand something.
[1:36:16] I want to draw your attention to
[1:36:18] Abraham.
[1:36:19] Abraham had Isaac and Ishmael. How many
[1:36:22] of us know that?
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:24] So in the life of Abraham,
[1:36:27] if Isma was not there, because the
[1:36:30] people that carried Joseph to Egypt was
[1:36:33] the Israelite.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know if somebody's catching
[1:36:40] this.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH NO, ABRAHAM, WHAT DID YOU
[1:36:43] MAKE A MISTAKE WITH AAR?" But all thing
[1:36:46] was there for a purpose because Abraham
[1:36:50] is the son of God. SO NOTHING CAN HAPPEN
[1:36:53] TO ABRAHAM. THERE'S A purpose behind the
[1:36:55] life of Abraham.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; But when God is seeing is seeing Ishmael
[1:37:00] carrying Joseph to Egypt.
[1:37:03] Are you catching this?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; God. Oh my goodness. The word of God is
[1:37:08] beautiful.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; So if something happened to you, there
[1:37:11] is a connection somewhere. There is a
[1:37:13] reason.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET FRUSTRATED ABOUT IT. THERE'S A
[1:37:17] REASON.
[1:37:20] Now Joseph comes is asking himself what
[1:37:22] have I done wrong? Everything just start
[1:37:25] going wrong. Is it not the same way of
[1:37:27] your life?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; You try this it doesn't work. You try
[1:37:30] you ask yourself what happened. Then he
[1:37:33] found himself in prison because Pifera's
[1:37:36] wife wanted to take him. He said no I'm
[1:37:39] going to still keep my purity. I still
[1:37:40] want to be right.
[1:37:44] But yet he thought if he stood for God
[1:37:47] everything will be okay.
[1:37:50] But now they throw him in prison.
[1:37:53] Sometime we do things because oh I'm
[1:37:56] going to keep the word just because of
[1:37:58] the zeal. He has to be a personality.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; If he has not come to a personality a
[1:38:04] change you will struggle with it.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; You start questioning ah I mean I stood
[1:38:08] for God. Why he cannot stand for me now
[1:38:10] and send me back to my parents?
[1:38:13] But Jo Joseph you have a purpose. You
[1:38:16] have a purpose in life. It's not it's
[1:38:18] not done yet.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Then later on he's having a dream in
[1:38:26] prison. Now
[1:38:28] he interprets Pharaoh's dream, right?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; And everything start going better. Are
[1:38:34] you with me?
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Saints, there is a beginning somewhere.
[1:38:38] There is something in between
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; and there's going to be a restoration
[1:38:42] again.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's the process of a life of a son of
[1:38:45] God.
[1:38:47] So this where you are struggling with
[1:38:49] this is just the middle ground. There is
[1:38:51] something that is good coming.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Job was happy. Everything is happening
[1:38:55] where he got to a place where he FOUND
[1:38:57] HIMSELF IN THE AIRSHIP. BUT YOU MUST as
[1:39:00] the son of God, a son of God, you must
[1:39:03] understand that oh
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; God is about to restore me.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; But as you are walking, you must have
[1:39:10] faith.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; That he will restore me because I'm a
[1:39:13] son of Abraham.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If he did it for Abraham,
[1:39:17] Isaac, Joseph, he will also do it for
[1:39:19] me.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Because why? God has a purpose.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Now he's elevated to power.
[1:39:28] But his brethren comes and and they
[1:39:30] kneel down and Joseph cries and you know
[1:39:33] and and and and gather all his brethren
[1:39:35] together, right?
[1:39:37] But Joseph, if he was not changed, he
[1:39:40] could have taken a a sword. He said,
[1:39:41] "Let me kill those people."
[1:39:43] But Joseph understood.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; He told them. He says it was not because
[1:39:48] of you. It was God's purpose.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; He understood by revelation.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; That it's not about you.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; It's about a purpose that God had in the
[1:40:01] back part of his mind.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; No revenge, but understanding.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Revelation. Yes.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Let's look at Jonah. Are we together? We
[1:40:19] still here, right?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I'm touching some points,
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; but later on the Holy Spirit will
[1:40:24] minister to you.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Jonah,
[1:40:30] this man,
[1:40:33] God knew that Jonah would not want to go
[1:40:36] because God knows the end before the
[1:40:38] beginning. Is that right? We just read
[1:40:39] it.
[1:40:40] So God is choosing a weak man who will
[1:40:44] now go.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. For a job.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; He's not choosing somebody who say, "Oh
[1:40:51] Lord, yes, I'll go right away."
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; No, he's choosing somebody that God
[1:40:57] knows that this guy will say, "No, I'm
[1:40:59] not going to go."
[1:41:01] But God says, "Jonah, you go to
[1:41:04] Nineveh." Jonah said, "No, no, no. I'm
[1:41:06] not. I'm going to Tarses." God says,
[1:41:09] "Okay, that's fine." And when Jonah is
[1:41:12] speaking, he's saying, "No, I'm not
[1:41:13] going to do it. These people need to
[1:41:15] die."
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Is it not the permissive will of God?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Is it? How many of us can say it's a
[1:41:22] permissive?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Is it disobedience?
[1:41:27] Did he disobey going to Tashes?
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. Come on. We have to be
[1:41:31] honest.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; It's okay.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; He disobey, right?
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I'll say yes.
[1:41:37] Then he get to the boat. He says, "No,
[1:41:40] you know what? I'm going to go sleep
[1:41:41] under there. Nobody will know." The God
[1:41:44] say, "Oh, okay." He send you know a
[1:41:47] storm.
[1:41:49] And when the storm happened, THEY SAID,
[1:41:51] "JONAH, WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING? WHY ARE
[1:41:53] YOU laying there? WHAT'S GOING ON?"
[1:41:55] JONAH comes and say, you know, maybe
[1:41:57] it's because
[1:41:59] oh my God,
[1:42:01] these men that did not even know God
[1:42:04] kneel down AND START PRAYING. FATHER,
[1:42:05] PLEASE. PLEASE.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; a backsliding
[1:42:12] prophet,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; a disobedient prophet
[1:42:17] gone,
[1:42:19] but yet the people can actually
[1:42:21] recognize the God of heaven.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; And kneel down and start confessing the
[1:42:26] sin. God heard their prayer.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of Jonah. They might have
[1:42:34] not even know God,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; but because of that circumstance,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; they came to know the God of heaven and
[1:42:41] earth.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Things that are happening in our life,
[1:42:46] it is for a purpose.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to understand.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; It's not over yet. It goes there, you
[1:42:56] know, and they throw Jonah, you're
[1:43:00] right, off board, right? Is that right?
[1:43:02] And then the well came and swallow him,
[1:43:04] right? And he goes there, he pray, you
[1:43:07] know, and he spent three days and what?
[1:43:09] Three days and three nights. Is that
[1:43:11] right?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; So let me stop you here. So if Jonah
[1:43:15] went straight to Nineveh, Jesus would
[1:43:18] not use that as a sign of the
[1:43:20] resurrection.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Because he said as Jonah was three days
[1:43:26] and three nights. So Jonah going to
[1:43:29] Tarsus
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; was there for a purpose.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; All things work for good.
[1:43:44] It goes to Tarses and whatever happened,
[1:43:47] right? And then and and he spent three
[1:43:50] days and three nights. But on the other
[1:43:53] side, the God of the Ninevite
[1:43:57] is a whale.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; These people don't even know God. But
[1:44:02] they're sitting by the beach. They see
[1:44:05] this man coming out of the whale belly.
[1:44:08] That's a whole conviction by itself.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; It says, "What?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; We believe in a God, but this man is
[1:44:14] coming out of the well means that this
[1:44:16] must be the God of heaven and earth."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible says
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Jonah was a sign.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; The man Jonah was a sign.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; That's the Bible.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Then he comes out. He just preaches a
[1:44:37] little sermon. People start repenting.
[1:44:41] Said you see the purpose of God is
[1:44:44] powerful.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; It looks at time is not our friend. And
[1:44:49] I could have continued, but I might
[1:44:51] actually stop. I'm going to close with
[1:44:53] David and I'm going to close. So, please
[1:44:56] forgive me. Do you give me like less
[1:44:58] than 10 minutes or something? Is that
[1:45:00] okay?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Five minutes.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. Five 10 minutes.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; David here, the Bible says second king
[1:45:08] verse 17 verse 7. I want you to catch
[1:45:11] this. Is that right?
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:13] The Bible says
[1:45:16] Satan provoked David to number what?
[1:45:20] Israel.
[1:45:25] This is Satan that is provoking David.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; To number Israel.
[1:45:31] God is not happy about it.
[1:45:34] God gets mad and said, "David, you were
[1:45:37] not supposed to do it." And he send
[1:45:40] David se God revealed himself to David
[1:45:43] Se right God. He says God tell David
[1:45:48] to choose these three things because I'm
[1:45:51] not happy. I'm going to bring judgment.
[1:45:52] God is mad. Is that right?
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; God is mad about it. But yet it was
[1:45:58] Satan that caused that provoked David to
[1:46:01] number.
[1:46:04] Are we together?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:08] Then God told David three things. He
[1:46:11] says, "Choose out of these three. Number
[1:46:14] one, either three years of famine
[1:46:18] or three months to be destroyed before
[1:46:21] the the fouls in other word adversary,
[1:46:23] enemies, oppressors, right? Why that the
[1:46:27] sword of the enemy over thee?" That's
[1:46:29] the second. The third one or as three
[1:46:32] day of the sword of the Lord even
[1:46:35] pestilency in the land and the angel of
[1:46:37] the Lord destroying throughout all the
[1:46:38] coast of Israel. David says no I don't
[1:46:41] want to fall into the hand of my enemy.
[1:46:43] I would rather fall into the hand of the
[1:46:45] Lord.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; He said no I better be here.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; And the angel came on the camp and
[1:46:53] killed seven 70 thousand people.
[1:46:58] And David comes, you know, he says, "I'm
[1:47:01] the one who have sinned. Why are you
[1:47:02] destroying all these people?" And he
[1:47:04] cried to the Lord and all. David, you
[1:47:07] know, kneel down and repent.
[1:47:10] And God is telling David, now I want you
[1:47:13] to understand this. He tell David,
[1:47:15] "Build an altar for me." Said, "You know
[1:47:19] what? That very same altar that David
[1:47:21] built, that was when the tabernacle
[1:47:24] was supposed to be built. was built
[1:47:28] is to let you know s sometimes Satan can
[1:47:32] provoke you to do things
[1:47:34] but God desire he wanted to build a
[1:47:38] tabernacle there he has his intention he
[1:47:40] has his plan
[1:47:43] but if Satan did not provoke David
[1:47:47] would not have built the tabernacle
[1:47:49] there
[1:47:51] so saints in your life things that are
[1:47:54] happening
[1:47:56] You just ask for God will. Lord, I don't
[1:47:59] understand. Show me what this thing
[1:48:02] means.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And I do believe with all my heart, the
[1:48:06] Lord will reveal it unto you.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; The Lord will reveal unto you. I'm
[1:48:12] closing with this last quote. I'm going
[1:48:14] to skip different things, but that's
[1:48:15] okay. The Lord will help us another time
[1:48:18] to touch on something different by his
[1:48:20] grace. I'm going to appreciate brother.
[1:48:22] How many of us love brother one? Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; We want to appreciate, you know, for
[1:48:26] giving us the opportunity to speak
[1:48:27] tonight. God bless you, sir.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Quote six. We're just going to go to
[1:48:32] six. I'm going to skip this.
[1:48:35] Brother Benham says, "God purpose can
[1:48:37] never be defeated. There is nothing can
[1:48:41] defeat it." Amen.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; So, how happy are we to be today resting
[1:48:48] upon that beautiful revelation of the
[1:48:51] word of the living God that there is
[1:48:54] neither things present, no things that
[1:48:57] can come. There is no sickness,
[1:49:00] no sorrow, no death, no peril, no
[1:49:03] nothing can separate us from the purpose
[1:49:06] of the living God.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] what God has imagined in his mind,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; what God has purposed in his heart to
[1:49:17] bring to pass. There is no demon, there
[1:49:21] is no power, there is nothing can ever
[1:49:25] separate God great immortal and eternal
[1:49:28] plan.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; It must be as God has said.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you are not here just sitting
[1:49:41] to there's a purpose.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; there's a purpose behind everything that
[1:49:46] you're dealing with.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; But you need to hold on to the Lord.
[1:49:49] Trust in the Lord.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; He's faithful to keep his promise even
[1:49:54] as the church of the living God. We are
[1:49:56] going through different things.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; But let us pray. Let's hold on to the
[1:50:01] word of God.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; If we are dealing with things in our
[1:50:04] life, the word is there. Let's read it
[1:50:07] every day.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Let's feed on the message of the hour.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; God has sent us a great There's a lot of
[1:50:12] things. It's not just the preacher.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine every single one of us
[1:50:16] go home and take time to study the
[1:50:18] message?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Can you just imagine all of us really
[1:50:23] taking the word and and really praying
[1:50:25] and seeking the Lord's face? What will
[1:50:27] happen in this place? It's not the size
[1:50:30] of a church.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; It's not how many people we've got.
[1:50:35] is the God inside of every heart that
[1:50:38] matters.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Saints, may God help us.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. I hope that this is a
[1:50:45] blessing to you.

[1:54:41] see it. She's beginning to realize, to
