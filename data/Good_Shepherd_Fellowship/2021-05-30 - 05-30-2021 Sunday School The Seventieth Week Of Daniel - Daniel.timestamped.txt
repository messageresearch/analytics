[0:00] [Music]
[0:26] tabernacle again this morning to
[0:28] continue
[0:29] this great message that we're
[0:32] endeavoring to explain this 70th week of
[0:36] daniel
[0:37] and we're happy to see so many has
[0:40] gathered out
[0:42] on this hot day and uh
[0:45] yet we're sorry that we do not have the
[0:47] seating room see people
[0:49] it's packed together like that and
[0:51] standing around
[0:52] it makes it uh unhandy and
[0:56] not being as comfortable as you should
[0:58] it makes it hard for you to understand
[1:01] but we will do everything that we can to
[1:02] make it quick and
[1:05] and today i hope that you'll if i'm a
[1:08] little angry that you'll excuse me
[1:10] because
[1:10] this is the nailing down time of this
[1:13] message
[1:14] very time to nail it down we set it in
[1:17] three orders so that we could be sure to
[1:19] get it
[1:21] now of course the the visible
[1:23] congregation
[1:24] knows that these are this messages are
[1:27] being taped and they're sent all around
[1:29] the world
[1:29] practically every nation receives these
[1:31] things around the world
[1:34] and uh i'd like to say this to the
[1:37] listeners of the tape wherever you are
[1:40] what part of the world that you're
[1:41] in that there may be some things in here
[1:44] that
[1:45] you might not agree with me upon the
[1:49] teachings that i
[1:50] i do but i would like
[1:53] to state brethren maybe that
[1:56] if you would explain it the way you saw
[2:00] it
[2:00] it might be different from what i would
[2:02] believe but i would be glad to listen at
[2:04] what you've got to say
[2:06] and uh it's with the thought
[2:09] that i bring these messages from the
[2:12] god's word
[2:13] uh in my heart it's for the
[2:17] edifying of the church for all the
[2:20] church
[2:21] the church universal christ church
[2:24] university and i
[2:27] certainly do believe that we're living
[2:29] in the last day
[2:32] and my endeavors to explain this and yet
[2:36] not try to make it push it one way or
[2:38] the other i have
[2:39] never been guilty as i know of of doing
[2:42] that
[2:44] many times people hear from tapes and
[2:47] they say well
[2:47] i disagree with that he just don't know
[2:50] his teaching
[2:52] doesn't know the scripture well that
[2:54] that may be all true
[2:56] i wouldn't say that isn't true but to me
[2:59] i i study it not taking any any
[3:02] words i read what other man has to say
[3:04] and appreciate them
[3:06] everything that anyone says i appreciate
[3:08] it but then
[3:10] then i'll take it to god and i'll stay
[3:13] with it until i can explain it
[3:16] from genesis to revelation amen and then
[3:19] see it all hook up in the bible and then
[3:21] i i know
[3:22] it's somewhere near right and of course
[3:25] or uh you're right that's just one place
[3:28] that i got off the
[3:30] the line at and maybe we're you're wrong
[3:33] or right that's where i got offline and
[3:35] vice versa
[3:36] so we appreciate all you
[3:39] fine people that you're in the audience
[3:43] this morning
[3:44] and for you fine people who hears these
[3:46] tapes
[3:48] and we uh all it's done is all for the
[3:50] kingdom of god
[3:52] i have many fine friends throughout the
[3:55] world that i appreciate so much
[3:58] and believe that i'll spend an eternity
[4:01] with them
[4:03] and it would not be in my heart to try
[4:05] to to deceive those people by any means
[4:07] but to try to bring to pass
[4:09] everything that i can to help them i
[4:12] feel like
[4:13] solomon did when he prayed and said give
[4:15] him wisdom
[4:16] that he might be able to lead god's
[4:18] people that's my sincere prayer
[4:21] my associates with the uh here and i see
[4:24] brother
[4:25] mercer and brother roy borders and
[4:29] brother neville billy paul my son jeans
[4:31] hear some words
[4:32] the brethren petty and then i appreciate
[4:35] all these
[4:36] people who come to help me i remember
[4:38] you're not long ago
[4:40] leo a vision that he had
[4:44] dream he called it one night when we
[4:46] first met
[4:47] that he saw a great pyramid
[4:50] pete way up in the air and i was up
[4:53] there preaching somewhere and
[4:55] he climbed up to see what it's all about
[4:58] when he got up on top this peak why he
[5:00] said way off in kind of a silver looking
[5:03] light or like a platter i was standing
[5:06] preaching to the people
[5:08] and he attracted my attention and i
[5:10] looked around to him
[5:12] and he said how did you ever get out
[5:14] there how could i get out there i said
[5:15] leo
[5:16] no one can come out here god has to take
[5:19] a man here
[5:20] now you're not to come up here
[5:24] you're to go down and witness to those
[5:26] people down there after you have seen it
[5:27] that it's the truth
[5:29] that that is the truth leo climbs back
[5:32] down to witness to the people
[5:34] how long ago has that been brother leo
[5:36] several years has several years
[5:38] since then as far as i know he's been
[5:39] faithful in doing that witnessing to the
[5:42] people
[5:42] that the ministry comes from god
[5:46] now and i i do not want it to come from
[5:48] me
[5:49] if it is for me then it's no good
[5:51] because there's no good in a man
[5:53] see it has to come from god now when i
[5:57] look around yesterday afternoon i shook
[6:00] hands with my friend brother wes
[6:01] i haven't spotted him yet in the
[6:03] building yes i have now
[6:05] this morning and you know how far people
[6:06] drive all the way from down in
[6:08] in alabama of a sunday to get here
[6:12] from way down in alabama
[6:15] brother welch evans i missed him last
[6:17] sunday somebody said he was here today
[6:19] that people drive from tifton georgia
[6:22] to be here and brother sitting here his
[6:26] partners so many brother
[6:29] polymer from macon georgia and
[6:33] i see i believe sister um
[6:36] anger and and then back there they're
[6:38] always from memphis tennessee
[6:41] now you think and others from other
[6:43] places just met a lady in here from over
[6:46] way over in south carolina now you think
[6:49] that people here started looking over
[6:50] from chicago and
[6:52] just different places driving hundreds
[6:55] and hundreds of
[6:56] miles just to attend a service
[7:01] then when they get here no room to sit
[7:03] down
[7:04] not an air conditioned room an old hot
[7:06] building just stand in
[7:09] wipe and perspiration taking them money
[7:11] from the table from their children
[7:13] to come here to listen to that message
[7:15] you mean to tell me there's not a
[7:17] beyond this stream somewhere that
[7:19] there's a place you're going one of
[7:20] these days
[7:20] [Applause]
[7:23] that's faithfulness those people are
[7:25] tithe payers
[7:27] not only do they come they bring into
[7:29] their tithe and offerings and bring it
[7:30] into the house of the lord
[7:33] trying to do what is right god richly
[7:37] bless a loyal people
[7:38] like that god's mercy and grace be with
[7:42] them
[7:44] i see my friend charlie cox
[7:47] those from down southern kentucky and
[7:50] just everywhere you look around you see
[7:52] people from
[7:53] different places this young man sitting
[7:54] here i can't call his name
[7:56] i met him in chicago but you're from
[7:58] some bible school away from here
[8:00] somewhere aren't you
[8:01] springfield missouri assembly of god
[8:03] bible school yeah well fine you see
[8:05] just come from everywhere in this little
[8:08] bitty old church
[8:10] just think about around 30 years ago
[8:14] when i laid the cornerstone that morning
[8:17] i was standing on 7th street one block
[8:19] away
[8:20] i wasn't even married yet just a young
[8:22] man and i seen a vision of people packed
[8:24] and jammed in here from everywhere
[8:27] and i was so happy standing behind the
[8:29] pulpit and that's when he told me but
[8:31] this is not your tabernacle
[8:33] and he set me down under the skies and
[8:36] um
[8:36] you know the rest of the story which is
[8:38] wrote on the leaf of the bible laying in
[8:39] the cornerstone there
[8:43] i'm so grateful for you people i can't
[8:46] that that's so little to to just say
[8:48] well i'm grateful for
[8:50] you but i pray for you i believe in you
[8:54] i believe in your experiences of god i
[8:57] don't believe that a man or woman would
[8:58] drive
[8:59] hundreds and hundreds of miles to come
[9:01] here to show what kind of clothes they
[9:02] were wearing
[9:04] i don't think they would do that no they
[9:06] wouldn't come here just to be seen
[9:08] they're coming here because they're
[9:10] deeply an
[9:12] insincerity for the salvation of their
[9:15] souls
[9:17] my prayer is god help me
[9:21] help me to just be at least half that
[9:24] sincere
[9:25] to try to minister them with all that's
[9:28] in my heart
[9:30] and looking to god the message you see
[9:32] this morning it's brought out here on
[9:34] the
[9:34] blackboard here it's just merely to make
[9:37] to explain as i go along
[9:40] to try to make uh that you might
[9:43] understand
[9:44] what i'm trying to speak up and this 70
[9:47] weeks of daniel has been
[9:49] one great study two days and two nights
[9:51] almost i've been at the end of the week
[9:52] here i've been on it trying to find
[9:54] what words to say for truth it's got to
[9:57] compare with the rest of the bible
[9:59] see you just can't take it this one
[10:01] little scripture and make a
[10:03] an understanding and then say well this
[10:05] is what this says
[10:06] and then turn around and say well uh uh
[10:08] but over here
[10:09] it says something else contradicts this
[10:12] it can't do that
[10:13] it's got to say the same thing all the
[10:14] time if you don't while that then you're
[10:17] you're wrong and that's the way i've
[10:19] tried to teach it
[10:22] by the way on the tapes then it's on the
[10:24] tapes
[10:26] the greatest uh criticism i have on
[10:29] tapes of my brethren out in the
[10:33] different parts of the world is
[10:37] believing in the grace of god that i
[10:40] teach the way i do that we were
[10:42] predestinated before the beginning
[10:44] of the world my pentecostal brethren
[10:48] of course i know that your views are
[10:50] legalist see
[10:52] and i i know it's a little upsetting to
[10:54] your views
[10:56] but would you as a christian brother
[11:00] would you just give it enough
[11:02] consideration to
[11:03] get on your knees before god with your
[11:05] bible
[11:06] and ask god to explain it to you would
[11:09] you do that
[11:10] would you take the legalistic point and
[11:12] try to make it connect from genesis to
[11:14] revelations
[11:15] and the seed of the serpent that's the
[11:18] killer
[11:20] many people don't believe that but if
[11:22] you'll just read in genesis the bible
[11:24] said that the serpent had a seed
[11:27] and i'll put enmity between the serpent
[11:29] seed and the woman's seed
[11:31] so the serpent had a seed
[11:34] and if the serpent's seed was spiritual
[11:36] then jesus was not a man
[11:39] so the woman's seed was spiritual they
[11:41] both had seeds and the enmity is still
[11:44] there
[11:44] and a serpent had a seed and if you just
[11:47] take your bible and get out and be real
[11:49] reverent before god
[11:51] i believe god will reveal it to you and
[11:53] if you do not understand it
[11:54] i'm i'm available anytime to do my very
[11:57] best to help you
[11:59] by a letter or by or by a personal
[12:02] interview
[12:03] or anything that i could do to help you
[12:05] of course we realize that that doesn't
[12:07] save a man
[12:08] neither does it condemn a man but it
[12:10] only brings
[12:11] light upon the subject that we're all
[12:13] trying so hard to get the people to see
[12:15] america it only brings life now to the
[12:18] audience is visible
[12:19] i said this because the tapes you see
[12:23] these tapes go all everywhere now
[12:26] let us bow our heads just a moment
[12:28] before we approach the
[12:30] author of this word how many
[12:33] in the audience this morning is needy
[12:37] just saying i'm needy oh god be merciful
[12:40] to me
[12:42] the lord bless and to those who will
[12:44] hear the tape
[12:45] when you hear it may god grant your
[12:48] request
[12:50] our heavenly father we are a grateful
[12:53] people
[12:53] yet an unworthy people but we are
[12:56] approaching thy
[12:57] throne of grace this morning
[13:02] because that we have been bid to come
[13:05] jesus said you ask the father anything
[13:07] in my name i'll do it
[13:09] now we know that that is true
[13:13] and here in the audience and out in the
[13:16] land where the tapes will go there will
[13:19] probably be
[13:20] tens of thousands of born-again
[13:23] christians
[13:23] hear this
[13:27] and we know father that when we are born
[13:30] again that our
[13:31] spirit is born
[13:34] from above it is the spirit of god the
[13:37] holy spirit
[13:38] upon us we realize that that holy spirit
[13:43] is all-powerful
[13:45] and can do anything for us that we
[13:47] desire to be done
[13:50] that heavenly father we would ask you to
[13:52] release our
[13:53] faith to that spirit that it might be
[13:57] able to secure for us this morning
[14:00] and for the glory of the kingdom of god
[14:02] all these requests and desires
[14:05] that we might be healed of our
[14:07] sicknesses
[14:09] and our afflictions that we might serve
[14:11] our god with all that's in us
[14:15] open up our ears of understanding today
[14:19] and as i endeavor to bring forth this
[14:21] great
[14:23] question and clear it in the people's
[14:26] minds
[14:28] now i have it written out your lord up
[14:30] on paper and also
[14:32] drawn up on this blackboard this chart
[14:36] but totally insufficient to explain it
[14:40] now we call on you the great
[14:45] master who wrote the word who
[14:48] inspired it who gave it to the prophet
[14:52] daniel and we pray that you'll
[14:56] send the inspiration this morning in
[14:58] these last days as he said the book will
[15:00] be closed until this time
[15:03] that you will open our understandings
[15:08] and may there be a soft vetted faith in
[15:11] our heart that'll let the word take
[15:14] holt and life
[15:17] bring forth the trees of
[15:20] righteousness in our lives that it's
[15:23] intended to do
[15:24] our faith in god
[15:27] may it secure that for us this morning
[15:30] for we
[15:30] humbly wait now and dedicating ourselves
[15:33] to thee
[15:34] in the name of jesus christ amen
[15:40] now we are grateful for this morning for
[15:42] the grand opportunity again
[15:45] to open up these pages of god's
[15:48] eternal word now
[15:52] the reason that i have taken up all
[15:56] myself to try to explain this
[15:59] is because of we're going through the
[16:03] book of
[16:04] revelations and we just come
[16:08] through the seven church ages
[16:13] and then at the end of the third chapter
[16:16] of the book of revelations
[16:19] the church is taken from the earth
[16:23] up into glory and i
[16:26] try with all my heart to get this
[16:30] to the people that they are
[16:34] expecting something
[16:36] to happen that they see wrote in the
[16:39] book of revelations when it was not
[16:41] applied in the church age
[16:44] and we are near the end than you think
[16:48] a few nights ago billy my or my
[16:52] daughter-in-law brother called me
[16:53] way in the night and said there was a
[16:56] man named
[16:57] andy herman which is a cousin i was
[16:59] laying dying in the hospital
[17:02] i went out to see him that doped him
[17:03] like so much that he's asleep and i
[17:05] couldn't talk to him the next morning
[17:07] i asked god to keep him alive to like
[17:09] that he's a good man
[17:11] but he just wasn't a christian he's not
[17:14] an uncle he's a cousin
[17:16] married a cousin of mine and then
[17:19] when 880 told me standing there she said
[17:21] billy all
[17:22] these 80 years of his life he hasn't
[17:25] served god
[17:27] but said a few weeks ago he was sitting
[17:29] in the house he
[17:30] 80 years old course he doesn't do much
[17:32] manual labor but said
[17:34] he called her and said eddie you know
[17:36] what
[17:38] christ came before me here just a few
[17:40] minutes ago
[17:42] she looked and said andy or are you
[17:44] what's the matter she said he said no
[17:46] he stood right here before me and he
[17:47] said something said what did he say
[17:49] it's later than you think
[17:52] in a few weeks to man two or three weeks
[17:54] he was stroked and laying paralyzed on
[17:56] her in the hospital
[17:57] dying i said ain't 80 shame on you
[18:02] for not calling me or somebody to get
[18:05] his
[18:05] heart in condition for this hour that
[18:08] he's now
[18:09] arrived at i asked the lord the next
[18:12] morning when i
[18:13] he couldn't talk so i just asked him i
[18:15] said can you hear me uncle andy
[18:17] he could nod his head little move his
[18:20] jaws
[18:21] i prayed for him had him to confess his
[18:25] sins before god
[18:26] i wanted to baptize him and ain't 80
[18:29] want to be baptized
[18:31] i went down the hall to see a young lady
[18:33] that lives in a neighborhood here that
[18:35] was going to stand to the mental
[18:36] hospital and the lord done a great thing
[18:38] for her
[18:39] come home then um on the road up i met a
[18:44] colored sister
[18:46] and she said aren't you uh brother
[18:49] branham and i said i am
[18:51] she said you remember me i'm miss dry
[18:53] and i said
[18:54] yes i believe i do pete drawing them i
[18:57] said yeah i'll remember you
[18:59] she looked into the room and when we did
[19:01] i wonder why she said that
[19:03] their uncle andy done raised up in the
[19:06] bed and
[19:07] setting up her moving his hands and arms
[19:08] like anybody else
[19:10] trying to get the thing the bed thing
[19:12] down so he could get out there and
[19:13] get away now they're coming to be
[19:16] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[19:18] he and his wife
[19:19] so but what i said that for it's
[19:22] later than we think
[19:26] amen and i believe that this 70
[19:30] weeks of daniel will bring it to our
[19:32] understanding
[19:34] now most of our pentecostal brethren
[19:36] which i said earlier
[19:38] on the tape that they disagree with this
[19:40] they're looking for a great
[19:42] powerful something to happen and my
[19:44] brethren if you listen real close
[19:46] and not and listen you'll find out that
[19:48] that great powerful something has done
[19:50] past
[19:53] jesus is ready to return
[19:56] the church leaves on the third chapter
[19:59] of revelations nothing said in there
[20:01] about nothing but just the last thing
[20:02] was the last messenger of the age
[20:06] then we deal with the jews until the
[20:09] coming again with the bride of the 19th
[20:11] chapter from the 6th to the 19th chapter
[20:14] is all jewish
[20:18] that's where i want to get to my good
[20:20] brother over here doing these seals
[20:22] brother woods which was formerly jehovah
[20:24] witness he and all of his family here
[20:26] this morning
[20:27] that uh those 144 000
[20:31] were not had anything to do with the
[20:33] gentiles they're jews
[20:35] see and it isn't the
[20:38] mystic body of christ in the earth today
[20:42] the bride is that mystic body by the
[20:45] holy spirit we're baptized into that
[20:47] mystic
[20:48] body now
[20:51] we know that in the book of daniel here
[20:53] where we've been reading we'll just read
[20:55] again because
[20:55] it's his word in the 9th chapter of
[20:59] daniel
[21:00] 24th verse 70 weeks are determined upon
[21:04] thy people upon thy
[21:05] holy city to finish the transgression to
[21:08] make an end of sin
[21:09] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[21:12] and to bring in everlasting
[21:14] righteousness and to seal
[21:15] up the vision and prophecy and to anoint
[21:18] the most holy 25th verse
[21:21] know therefore and understand that from
[21:24] now that's what we've been
[21:25] speaking on and we ended up on that last
[21:28] sunday night
[21:29] anointing the most holy here's where we
[21:32] begin this morning on the 25th verse
[21:34] and therefore know therefore and
[21:37] understand
[21:38] that from the going forth of the
[21:39] commandment to restore
[21:42] and to refill jerusalem that's the holy
[21:45] city see
[21:46] unto messiah the prince shall be seven
[21:50] weeks and three score and two
[21:53] weeks and the streets shall be built
[21:56] again
[21:57] and the walls and even in troublesome
[22:00] times
[22:01] and after three score and two weeks
[22:04] shall messiah be cut
[22:05] off but not for himself
[22:09] and the people of the prince that shall
[22:12] come shall destroy the city
[22:14] and the sanctuary and the end thereof
[22:17] shall be with
[22:18] great flood and unto the end of the war
[22:21] desolations are determined and
[22:25] now remember that's the end of the war
[22:27] we have it on the
[22:28] border and now we're starting something
[22:31] else
[22:32] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[22:34] many for one week
[22:37] and in the midst of the weak
[22:40] he shall cause the sacrifice and the
[22:42] oblige
[22:43] to cease and for the over spreading of
[22:46] abomination
[22:47] he shall make it descent even unto the
[22:50] consummation that's all
[22:55] and that determined shall be poured out
[22:58] upon the desolate
[23:01] oh what a lesson
[23:04] i said to my wife the other day i
[23:08] wonder if the people are really getting
[23:11] it
[23:12] now i want you to get it don't
[23:15] if you we have to stay here all day long
[23:17] just stay
[23:18] uh we we want to get it see we want to
[23:21] know that it's
[23:22] truth and you if you can just only see
[23:24] it
[23:27] and i ask maybe and then afterwards i'm
[23:29] going to leave the chart hang here and
[23:30] you you can draw it out
[23:32] afterwards come in here this afternoon
[23:33] whenever you want to and throw out the
[23:35] charts and so forth
[23:36] it'll help you to understand that's the
[23:37] reason i put it there so that you would
[23:39] understand it
[23:41] now let's review just a little bit so we
[23:44] can get a base
[23:45] now there was daniel was concerned
[23:49] about his people because he had read
[23:51] jeremiah the prophet
[23:54] and understood that jeremiah
[23:57] had said that they would be
[24:00] in captivity for 70 years
[24:05] and then he's seen then they'd already
[24:08] been in captivity for
[24:09] 68 years so he knew the time was at hand
[24:16] so he set aside all of his work
[24:19] pulled out as it was the shades of all
[24:21] his daily tasks
[24:23] set his space to god put on sackcloth
[24:26] and ashes
[24:26] and went to fasting and praying that he
[24:29] might
[24:30] understand when that time would be amen
[24:34] then we find as i have stated before
[24:37] would you turn that around or towards
[24:38] that we just live in the fan it's just a
[24:40] little bit too much it makes me hoarse
[24:42] then um thank you brother now
[24:46] that we find out that daniel
[24:50] he wanted this information for his
[24:54] people
[24:55] and i think if daniel reading the
[24:58] prophets
[24:59] before him and had
[25:02] this kind of an understanding that he
[25:04] was near the end
[25:06] and sought god to find out how close the
[25:10] end was
[25:12] then i think we're justified
[25:15] by seeing that we're at the end of the
[25:17] road
[25:18] now uh put on
[25:21] not sackcloth and ashes but throw off
[25:23] the things of the world
[25:25] and our cares of this life and seek god
[25:28] to find out
[25:30] what day of the year are we in because
[25:32] we see we're
[25:33] at the end and so that the church will
[25:37] fast and pray and be ready
[25:40] that's why i have endeavored to take
[25:42] upon myself
[25:43] not knowing how to explain this because
[25:45] i bypassed it each time
[25:47] and said them 70 weeks of daniel because
[25:50] i could not understand it
[25:53] and that's why i have taken it up on
[25:54] myself now to try to explain it
[25:58] and i believe by the help of the lord
[26:01] i can do it with his grace to bring it
[26:03] the word show you how close we are to
[26:05] the coming of the lord
[26:06] now daniel was this in two years then we
[26:09] find out that while he was in prayer
[26:12] the angel gabriel rushed to him
[26:16] and not only explained to him when his
[26:18] people were going out of
[26:19] captivity but also
[26:23] all that was determined for his people
[26:26] all that was yet left for his people he
[26:28] said there are seventy
[26:29] of weeks yet left for the jew
[26:34] then we find that he had a six-fold
[26:36] purpose
[26:37] and one of them was to finish the
[26:39] transgression
[26:41] and um and uh to make an end of sin
[26:45] to make reconciliations for iniquity
[26:49] bring everlasting righteousness in seal
[26:52] up the vision in prophecy
[26:54] and to anoint the most holy
[26:57] and we taken last sunday morning daniel
[27:01] in his condition down there praying last
[27:04] sunday evening
[27:05] given the scriptures so that people
[27:07] would read it when they got home
[27:09] did you read it did you like it
[27:11] wonderful
[27:12] now the six-fold purpose
[27:16] and we find out that on this sixth
[27:19] purpose
[27:20] to anoint the most holy we find out that
[27:22] most
[27:23] holy always represented the church
[27:27] the tabernacle and the last thing was to
[27:30] be done was to anoint the most holy
[27:32] that's the millennial
[27:34] tabernacle that he'll live in during
[27:37] the millennium that we live in now
[27:41] today now we are approaching what
[27:44] is the 70 weeks
[27:48] and this is a very vital part
[27:53] the 70 weeks now we know the scriptures
[27:58] cannot lie amen they
[28:01] have to be truth and if this
[28:04] angel gabriel come and told daniel
[28:07] that there's only 70 weeks left for the
[28:10] jews
[28:12] now we would apply that to six day or
[28:15] seven day
[28:16] week but in prophecy
[28:20] it's always given parables
[28:23] and so no doubt that down through the
[28:26] age there has been
[28:27] hundreds times hundreds of people
[28:30] scholars
[28:31] abled men trying to explain what these
[28:34] 70 weeks were
[28:36] now i've read many of their commentaries
[28:38] on them
[28:39] and uh i'm very grateful
[28:43] to mr smith of the adventist church for
[28:46] his views
[28:48] i'm very grateful to dr larkin
[28:51] of his views i'm grateful to all these
[28:54] great scholars
[28:56] father the reviews on this and in
[28:59] reading them it enlightens me
[29:01] much that i can find places that looks
[29:03] right
[29:05] but to get the views that i i thought
[29:08] that i would like to explain
[29:10] i searched through the encyclopedia of
[29:12] time
[29:13] to find out what time meant and we find
[29:17] out over here we got
[29:18] time time and dividing of time
[29:21] what is time what is a week now that's
[29:25] been 3430 years ago
[29:29] since this was since god started dealing
[29:33] with the jew many many years ago
[29:37] daniel was bc that time was bc
[29:41] 538 538
[29:45] years before christ when he spoke this
[29:48] for time time and dividing of time and
[29:51] 70 weeks
[29:52] look where 70 weeks would take him while
[29:54] he was still in babylon
[29:56] in 70 weeks and yet god told him that
[29:59] that was
[30:00] all the time that was determined upon
[30:02] the people
[30:04] now my church here knows that
[30:07] all through the years i've always told
[30:10] you
[30:11] if you want to know what day of the week
[30:13] it is look at the calendar
[30:15] but if you want to know the time we're
[30:16] living in watch those
[30:18] jews that's the only time peace god
[30:22] blotted note
[30:24] no certain times for the gentiles
[30:27] there was no certain space of time and
[30:28] that's why i think that many great
[30:30] writers
[30:30] mixed it up was trying to apply this to
[30:32] the jew and gentile because he said
[30:34] thy people but he was talking to daniel
[30:37] not to the church
[30:39] daniel's people the jew if he was
[30:42] talking to the church you can't make
[30:43] that run
[30:44] nowhere you're way back even before the
[30:47] coming of christ to run out any kind of
[30:49] prophetic weeks you want to put it in
[30:51] it's already run out but he was talking
[30:53] to the jews so therefore the jew
[30:55] is god's time peace
[30:59] remember you're not long ago when
[31:00] brother argenbright
[31:02] of california the vice president of the
[31:05] international
[31:05] full gospel businessman's association
[31:08] come to my house
[31:34] you
