[20:07] Lord when the Lord turned again the
[20:10] Captivity of
[20:11] Zion we were like them that
[20:15] dream then was our mouth filled with
[20:18] laughter and our tongue with
[20:21] singing then said they among the haens
[20:25] the Lord have done great things for them
[20:29] the Lord have done great things for us
[20:32] whereof we are glad turn again our
[20:36] captivity oh Lord as a stream in the
[20:40] South they that sold in tears shall weep
[20:44] in
[20:45] Joy he shall go
[20:49] forth and weepth bearing precious
[20:54] seeds shall doubtless come again with
[20:58] rejoicing bringing his sheep with him
[21:02] praise the
[21:03] Lord
[21:05] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[21:07] Lord this morning and uh it's good to
[21:10] see the grace of God on your faces and
[21:13] uh uh the Lord bless you you may have
[21:15] your seat I have a few prayer needs I
[21:18] want to read to to us this morning
[21:21] before we uh uh going into
[21:25] praying praise the Lord
[21:29] and I think the Lord kind of for
[21:31] ordained that we should have a prayer
[21:34] meeting in the first month of the year
[21:37] and uh because I did not plan it but I
[21:40] think uh the Lord kind of for order it
[21:43] that way and uh uh right after the 31st
[21:49] Service uh many many of the Saints God
[21:52] sake and and uh
[21:55] uh and so we started having prayer
[21:58] meeting just not to keep much time in
[22:02] the building and uh by the grace of God
[22:05] most everybody has recovered and then um
[22:09] uh out of that also brother brother
[22:14] Lawrence took something that he was
[22:15] alleged to and he kind of broke up
[22:17] things on his body but he's doing well
[22:21] and uh so last Wednesday he was prepared
[22:23] to lead Sunset I told him no uh let's
[22:26] just continue the sunset service you Le
[22:29] songs on Sunday and then uh uh it turned
[22:32] out also that uh uh he couldn't be with
[22:35] us this morning so I feel like the Lord
[22:38] want us to continue this way and I think
[22:41] it's a good thing uh for the
[22:43] church and as many as many of us uh many
[22:48] of you know as we uh uh if you have
[22:52] observe how we have uh order prayer
[22:56] service around around uh the the
[23:00] Tabernacle year it has always been from
[23:03] prayer needs and and burden because
[23:06] that's what I believe uh
[23:10] um prayer is it's a burden that is from
[23:13] the hearts of the people when the people
[23:16] bring in prayer needs and other
[23:19] things and uh so I've been turning a
[23:23] whole lot to lot of different SS prayer

[54:00] Philippians before the book of first and
[54:03] second tting
[54:35] let's read from uh revelution chapter 1
[54:38] verse
[54:50] 25
[54:52] wherefore I am made a minister according
[54:54] to the dispensation of God which is
[54:58] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[55:02] of
[55:04] God even the Mysteries the mystery which
[55:09] have been hid from
[55:11] ages and from
[55:14] generation but
[55:16] now is made manifest to his
[55:21] sins to
[55:23] whom God will make know what is the
[55:27] riches of the glory of this mystery now
[55:32] you have to know now it's just one
[55:35] mystery but there is a three parts to
[55:38] that mystery
[55:41] amen verse 26 again even the mystery
[55:46] which have been
[55:47] he from ages and from
[55:51] generation but now is made manifest to
[55:54] his sins
[55:56] to whom God will make known what is the
[56:00] riches of the glory of this mystery
[56:03] among the
[56:06] Gentiles and what is the
[56:09] mystery which is Christ in you the hope
[56:13] of
[56:14] glory father I pray that Lord you will
[56:18] bless this little word of
[56:20] exhortation and uh May something be said
[56:24] Lord that we encourage your people this
[56:27] morning in Jesus name
[56:30] amen amen the Lord bless you you may
[56:33] have your
[56:38] seat when you look in Revelation chapter
[56:45] 10 when you look in Revelation chapter
[56:48] 10
[57:06] in Revelation chap 10: 7 uh what what
[57:11] stands out as a familiar ver uh verse in
[57:14] the Bible to us as message
[57:18] Believers verse 7 says but in the days
[57:21] of the voice of the seven
[57:24] Angel when he shall be begin to
[57:27] sound the
[57:29] mystery not
[57:31] Mysteries the mystery just one
[57:35] mystery and that's the same thing that
[57:37] Paul spoke about there in cusan the
[57:40] mystery of God should be
[57:43] finished as he have declared to his
[57:46] servants the prophets so this one
[57:49] mystery God has declared it to all the
[57:55] prophets down through the
[57:57] ages and this mystery is Christ in you
[58:02] the hope of
[58:04] glory praise the Lord
[58:08] amen Christ in you the hope of glory so
[58:13] uh we want to we want to encourage you a
[58:15] little bit uh uh yeah I was I was just I
[58:19] was just thinking this morning just when
[58:22] I got in the office praying a little bit
[58:25] and I just said Lord uh I mean there
[58:27] there's just a lot of distraction that
[58:29] is going on but uh uh we want to look to
[58:33] you the Altar and the finisher of our
[58:35] faith amen and pray that he give us
[58:37] strength and and inspiration this
[58:39] morning to be able to say something that
[58:42] will encourage you so we want to talk
[58:44] about this this one mystery this morning
[58:48] I'm not going to go into a lot of uh
[58:50] mysterious things or uh Christ is the
[58:52] mystery of God revealed that that is a
[58:54] whole series there but I just want to
[58:56] grab your attention to something just
[58:59] like Paul said as we have just read he
[59:03] says uh uh uh this mystery is Christ in
[59:06] you the hope of glory now you take think
[59:10] about it think about it this way and uh
[59:15] uh when when God made man in the
[59:19] beginning uh
[59:24] uh and then on the six day the Bible
[59:27] says he formed a man in His
[59:30] image and and he rested in the in the
[59:34] message uh uh uh God transforming power
[59:38] brother bam says God never work again
[59:40] because he got a man to to carry on the
[59:42] work praise the Lord so he he never work
[59:46] again he he started using man from then
[59:49] on so it gave us an idea to see that uh
[59:53] God had an ultimate desire
[59:56] desire was to be made
[59:59] flesh that is God higher expression amen
[1:00:04] when God Express himself he can express
[1:00:07] himself through the sun through the moon
[1:00:10] the stars and everything that he may but
[1:00:13] his ultimate his most desire expression
[1:00:17] is to be made flesh praise the Lord amen
[1:00:22] so then you can understand why that was
[1:00:26] a mystery like Paul said it was a
[1:00:28] mystery he from all ages because All
[1:00:32] Through the Ages is so easy for us to
[1:00:35] see men in the picture praise the Lord
[1:00:39] but the mystery behind the different men
[1:00:42] that God used All Through the Ages was
[1:00:46] that it was
[1:00:48] Christ the hope of
[1:00:50] glory praise the Lord amen the hope of
[1:00:55] glory
[1:00:57] Christ in you is the hope of glory are
[1:01:02] we together with our Christ in you we
[1:01:06] don't have a
[1:01:07] Rapture with our Christ in you we don't
[1:01:10] have
[1:01:11] eternity the hope of glory the thing
[1:01:15] that uh uh uh Heaven Waits For That
[1:01:18] Glory waits for that all the saints of
[1:01:21] all ages is waiting for is that Christ
[1:01:24] should be formed in in
[1:01:29] you the hope of this word this Earth
[1:01:33] cannot be
[1:01:34] redeemed until Christ is formed in
[1:01:41] you are we
[1:01:43] together Christ in you is the hope of
[1:01:47] glory and that is the mystery now we
[1:01:50] talk about sep and seed and water
[1:01:53] baptism these are all information
[1:01:58] they are all informations surrounding
[1:02:01] that
[1:02:02] mystery all through the years we have
[1:02:04] dwell on the information we have U on
[1:02:07] the information and F on the information
[1:02:11] no it's to coming it's three coming it's
[1:02:13] morning coming it's evening coming it's
[1:02:15] back work baptism front War baptism we
[1:02:18] are just forcing on
[1:02:22] information praise the Lord
[1:02:26] amen if a check is written for us to to
[1:02:30] cat the check and every one of us have a
[1:02:32] different idea of how much amount is on
[1:02:35] that check we're not going to cash
[1:02:38] it praise the Lord I think that's five I
[1:02:43] think there's no he the way he write his
[1:02:45] five it looks like S I think there's six
[1:02:48] we we not going to cash it and that's
[1:02:50] the problem with the church we just been
[1:02:52] arguing on the information we have not
[1:02:55] been cashing in the check to get the
[1:03:02] result we not been cashing the check to
[1:03:05] get the
[1:03:07] result and enjoy the benefit of what is
[1:03:10] written on the check for
[1:03:13] us we are living on a privilege we have
[1:03:16] a check in our hands and we just fing
[1:03:19] about who supposed to catch the check
[1:03:21] he's the next one in line and and and
[1:03:23] know this it's not this one and we just
[1:03:25] fing about
[1:03:30] that praise the Lord I was talking to a
[1:03:32] brother one time and a good friend of
[1:03:34] mine and and uh uh we were and and he
[1:03:38] taught that he saw something that that
[1:03:41] is an error so he says uh and and and
[1:03:43] and you know and and we say all the time
[1:03:46] uh you know Revelation chapter 10:7 you
[1:03:48] know uh in the sounding of the Mysteries
[1:03:50] you know and and then he said he says
[1:03:52] you see it's just one what is that one
[1:03:54] mystery so I saidwell if we would just
[1:03:57] have a conversation and stop fussing if
[1:04:00] we can just talk maybe we can reason
[1:04:05] together praise the Lord because in the
[1:04:09] mind
[1:04:11] of the bunch of Believers in the
[1:04:15] message when we read this scripture I
[1:04:18] I've been I've been guilty of there
[1:04:20] before you know when we read this
[1:04:22] particular verse we don't say mystery we
[1:04:25] say see
[1:04:26] mistress because we have now been
[1:04:28] exposed to all of these things that we
[1:04:30] think we
[1:04:36] know praise the Lord are we together so
[1:04:40] you will see that's the reason why uh
[1:04:43] brother Brandon would tell us that U uh
[1:04:46] uh Christ is those
[1:04:49] seals the seal is
[1:04:53] Christ are we together
[1:04:56] I don't want to get into into lot of
[1:04:59] explanation this morning but uh uh
[1:05:03] there's something on my mind and and
[1:05:04] that's what I want to go into this
[1:05:06] morning if if the Lord will help us and
[1:05:08] I think uh I want to I want to use that
[1:05:13] and and and see if I can encourage you
[1:05:16] but also I want to use that to also be
[1:05:20] able to uh uh speak to our local church
[1:05:26] situation or speak to our local church
[1:05:29] need praise the Lord
[1:05:33] amen and it's it's something that I've
[1:05:35] I've been studying uh a while now and
[1:05:39] and I T well I need to uh Lord I need to
[1:05:41] I need to find a good time to be able to
[1:05:44] to uh to bring this but I feel on my
[1:05:47] heart this morning that uh you know is
[1:05:49] going to encourage
[1:05:51] you are we
[1:05:53] together praise the Lord
[1:06:08] now so just like we said U uh um Christ
[1:06:12] in you is the hope of glory for Christ
[1:06:14] to be form in you is the hope of glory
[1:06:18] praise the
[1:06:21] Lord Paul will also say something in the
[1:06:25] same light in the book of
[1:06:27] galatian uh let's see if we can we can
[1:06:30] read
[1:06:31] it I'm going to read a quote here where
[1:06:34] brother Brandon referred to that but I
[1:06:36] want those to be able to look at
[1:06:53] that in in in galatian chap 4:9
[1:06:58] 19 Galatians chapter 4:
[1:07:02] 19 now I remember now Paul was speaking
[1:07:05] to this galatian and he was trying to
[1:07:07] encourage them uh because some of the
[1:07:10] things that they have got away from they
[1:07:12] started going back to some of those
[1:07:14] Traditions they started going back to
[1:07:16] some of those worthiness and they
[1:07:18] started allowing some things in their
[1:07:20] life and you know and then he started he
[1:07:23] started you know uh speaking to them
[1:07:25] from the the beginning of his writing he
[1:07:27] was very harsh to them he called in
[1:07:28] foolish galaan who have deceived you you
[1:07:31] know who have presented another of
[1:07:33] Christ to you but listen listen how he
[1:07:35] will speak to them here as a father in
[1:07:38] uh verse 19 he says my little
[1:07:41] children of whom I travel in
[1:07:46] birth again until Christ be form in you
[1:07:53] I desire to be present with you now and
[1:07:58] to change my voice for I stand in doubt
[1:08:02] of you praise the Lord but he's
[1:08:05] expressing something here to them and
[1:08:07] saying my little children of whom I have
[1:08:09] traveled now he's using a kind of uh uh
[1:08:15] language of a woman that is caring a
[1:08:17] child or the woman that is respecting
[1:08:20] the child i' have worked with you I have
[1:08:23] Labor with you I've gone through your
[1:08:25] different birth pains as this word is
[1:08:28] beginning to form in you and just at a
[1:08:31] time where the word is beginning to form
[1:08:34] in you you are beginning to be
[1:08:38] distracted praise the Lord which of
[1:08:41] course it comes also with the natural
[1:08:45] birth uh not many times do the mother
[1:08:49] understand the language of her body when
[1:08:53] she's carrying a child
[1:08:57] praise the
[1:08:59] Lord like uh the they call it the
[1:09:02] morning sickness and the different
[1:09:03] things that that she would go through
[1:09:06] she don't understand that right from the
[1:09:09] onset she's expecting to have a child
[1:09:12] she want to have a child but when when
[1:09:15] that child is beginning to form in her
[1:09:19] the changes of her body she don't
[1:09:22] understand it until she she stole that
[1:09:25] she's pregnant until uh maybe you know
[1:09:29] if she has been a mother after a few
[1:09:31] time she might be able to pick up one or
[1:09:34] two things but a new mother don't pick
[1:09:38] it up all the time praise the Lord so
[1:09:41] let's read this together and then you
[1:09:43] will get the picture of where I want to
[1:09:45] go this
[1:09:47] morning praise the
[1:09:53] Lord this was what caught my my
[1:09:56] attention um uh brother Brandon said
[1:10:00] this in the message we have seen his
[1:10:02] tith and have come to worship Him and we
[1:10:06] want to read this to
[1:10:11] you he said this he
[1:10:14] said when Christ
[1:10:18] Jesus was being formed in
[1:10:21] Merit that's when the persecution set
[1:10:27] in that's
[1:10:29] right that's right that's when her
[1:10:33] persecution
[1:10:35] started are we
[1:10:38] together before then she was a lovely
[1:10:42] girl you know she could hang out with
[1:10:45] her friends but when she came to this
[1:10:47] place to start to tell everybody about
[1:10:51] this Angel
[1:10:52] visitation then that's when her person
[1:10:55] persecution started and then he read
[1:10:57] this very very verse we read he says and
[1:11:00] is the same thing in you the
[1:11:04] church is the same thing in
[1:11:08] you galatian 4:19 says there when Christ
[1:11:13] the hope of glory form form in you
[1:11:17] Christ is being formed in
[1:11:19] you when you are dying and Christ is
[1:11:24] coming to life wash the persecution set
[1:11:29] in wash trouble start on every hand
[1:11:34] watchh the devil go on the Rampage
[1:11:37] certainly when Christ is being formed in
[1:11:43] you praise the
[1:11:45] Lord can we relate to that is does that
[1:11:49] sound like something we can relate
[1:11:51] to amen does that uh uh uh uh uh you
[1:11:56] know uh uh kind of of kind of a speak to
[1:11:58] speak to us this morning praise the Lord
[1:12:01] and so that's that's where I want to go
[1:12:03] that's what I want to drive down this
[1:12:05] morning to be able for us to be able to
[1:12:08] see you know uh uh we we have to realize
[1:12:12] that the church is is uh you know is a
[1:12:16] is a type is a bride to Christ she's a
[1:12:18] type of of Christ in that way so we
[1:12:22] seeing here Paul tell in the church that
[1:12:26] Christ in you is the hope of
[1:12:30] glory amen he says and Christ in you is
[1:12:35] the mystery of all the
[1:12:40] ages of all the ages what God was doing
[1:12:44] since the
[1:12:47] beginning praise the Lord when God
[1:12:50] stepped down from him being an internal
[1:12:54] spirit because one time it was him and
[1:12:57] him
[1:12:57] alone when he stepped down from being an
[1:13:01] eternal spirit with a plan of
[1:13:06] creation his ultimate
[1:13:09] desire was to do among his
[1:13:14] people praise the
[1:13:16] Lord God plan was to have a
[1:13:20] family not a family where he leaves and
[1:13:24] and and travel a family that he would
[1:13:27] dwell
[1:13:29] with Exodus chapter 19 he said the same
[1:13:32] thing to the children of Israel I have
[1:13:35] chosen you as a family a Perpetual
[1:13:38] family a family of priests I want to
[1:13:40] make you that that is his
[1:13:44] desire he's not this God that want to be
[1:13:47] behind the clouds and have us on Earth
[1:13:50] figuring things by ourself
[1:13:55] no that's not his
[1:13:57] desire are we
[1:14:02] together amen are you are you beginning
[1:14:05] to see the
[1:14:11] picture a God that is distant he says uh
[1:14:15] H uh uh uh I mean uh uh uh we read that
[1:14:19] Deuteronomy Paul also echoed that in the
[1:14:22] Book of Romans you know if we confess
[1:14:24] with our mouth and believe in our heart
[1:14:27] he says we cannot say God must come from
[1:14:29] Heaven he's even n he's so
[1:14:35] close he is so
[1:14:41] close are you beginning to see the
[1:14:44] picture so that's his desire his desire
[1:14:48] was to D so when he came down and
[1:14:51] started making making an earth and
[1:14:54] separating the water from the land he
[1:14:56] said everything everything and and and
[1:14:59] every seed must must uh uh uh be able to
[1:15:02] bring for after his kind and uh you know
[1:15:05] put the the the fishes in the water the
[1:15:08] flowers in the air he said
[1:15:11] everything and then on the sixth
[1:15:16] day he said
[1:15:19] okay let us meet
[1:15:23] man in our image
[1:15:26] praise the Lord amen he's coming to that
[1:15:30] great expression now he didn't say let
[1:15:33] just let just make man to inhabit the
[1:15:35] Earth he says let make man in our image
[1:15:38] and in our
[1:15:44] likeness and the Bible says God made Man
[1:15:47] In His
[1:15:48] Image praise the Lord are we
[1:15:53] together so you see that was his
[1:15:56] ultimate desire Christ in you the hope
[1:15:59] of
[1:16:00] glory if you miss that you miss
[1:16:03] everything you miss the entire
[1:16:06] Redemption
[1:16:07] story The the Redemption story is not to
[1:16:11] make one h a holy man there in the
[1:16:14] church and make one holy bishop or Holy
[1:16:17] Father know that the the the Redemption
[1:16:20] story is Christ want to be in you Christ
[1:16:24] in you
[1:16:25] is the hope of
[1:16:33] glory are we together but see this
[1:16:36] picture that we are looking at now here
[1:16:39] is God All Through the Ages he have used
[1:16:42] different men and uh uh uh he started
[1:16:44] right down from Adam and then he called
[1:16:47] a man Noah uh that he told to build an
[1:16:50] act and then he got a man by the name of
[1:16:52] Abraham and he spoke to AB Abraham
[1:16:55] Abraham kept telling people you know I'm
[1:16:58] going to be the father of Nations I I
[1:17:00] mean God was dealing with him I mean
[1:17:02] many around him couldn't understand it
[1:17:04] until one day Sarah was called into the
[1:17:07] picture and God there with these men All
[1:17:10] Through the Ages but y City came to the
[1:17:12] place where God have chosen to come
[1:17:15] through a little virgin and he's going
[1:17:18] to get a bother for himself like we saw
[1:17:20] before he produced the egg cells and the
[1:17:23] blood cells and he's going to to to
[1:17:26] manifest himself and and in doing this
[1:17:30] we see here that
[1:17:32] uh just at this at this time like we
[1:17:35] said when Christ Jesus was being formed
[1:17:39] in
[1:17:40] Mary that's when the persecution set
[1:17:46] in Praise the Lord let me take you back
[1:17:49] a little bit let me take you back God
[1:17:52] told
[1:17:53] Abraham that I'm going to come down with
[1:17:56] a mighty hands after 400 years and I
[1:17:59] will deliver the
[1:18:00] people praise the lord it's a promise
[1:18:04] that has been lying down there
[1:18:07] until God gave a man amram a burden and
[1:18:11] he started praying and and and and that
[1:18:14] be to spread and people started praying
[1:18:16] and they started Desiring the deliverer
[1:18:19] they started Desiring that the deliverer
[1:18:21] will be born they want to get out of
[1:18:23] Egypt that I mean they on Bish yeah the
[1:18:26] tax Master is so bad to them they are
[1:18:28] whipping them they I mean they they are
[1:18:30] in pains they are not enjoying like it
[1:18:33] used to be when Joseph was once in
[1:18:37] Egypt praise the Lord now when God was
[1:18:42] about to send this
[1:18:46] deliverer praise the Lord amen just in
[1:18:50] the time where Moses was born
[1:18:56] when the deliverer was yet in an infant
[1:19:00] State when the deliverer was yet in the
[1:19:03] sea
[1:19:04] form what
[1:19:06] happened a persecution come on the
[1:19:11] people praise the
[1:19:14] Lord Pharaoh increased the
[1:19:19] attacks and again he said they have they
[1:19:22] having so many time to to to prayed and
[1:19:25] and all of that increased their
[1:19:27] work and for the matter of fact the the
[1:19:30] the the Egyptian are increasing so he
[1:19:33] said to them well let's get rid of all
[1:19:35] the all all the children from this
[1:19:38] setting age
[1:19:40] down praise the Lord are we
[1:19:44] together now so we see here that right
[1:19:48] at a time where the deliverer was going
[1:19:51] to be born a persecution said on the
[1:19:55] people of
[1:19:57] Israel so it is almost almost and always
[1:20:01] just at the time of our
[1:20:06] deliverance just at a time where God is
[1:20:09] about to step on the sin and bring his
[1:20:12] word to
[1:20:15] pass praise the Lord are we together
[1:20:20] amen but before Merit will be uh
[1:20:25] uh uh have any uh encounter with an
[1:20:28] angel or have a testimony to talk about
[1:20:31] an
[1:20:32] angel she had all her friends maybe she
[1:20:35] was the you know the the the more
[1:20:37] likable girl everybody talk about her
[1:20:40] the priest praise her in
[1:20:43] church praise the Lord but when she will
[1:20:46] come with that testimony that it is no
[1:20:49] longer I that
[1:20:51] liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[1:20:55] hallah then her persecution
[1:21:00] starts are we together are you seeing
[1:21:03] the picture because it's a parting
[1:21:06] through God's word and the thing about
[1:21:09] it that is that that that I want us to
[1:21:11] realize is that uh it is the enemy that
[1:21:15] is trying to stop that word from coming
[1:21:18] to pass he's trying to stop you from
[1:21:21] getting to your full potential he's
[1:21:24] trying to stop you from getting to the
[1:21:26] place where you can really get you know
[1:21:29] he don't have a problem if you are just
[1:21:31] a church member he don't have no problem
[1:21:33] if you just warm the bench don't even
[1:21:36] understand what a preacher is preaching
[1:21:39] about it does not bother him at
[1:21:42] all praise the
[1:21:45] Lord but what really rock his
[1:21:49] but amen is when an individual or a man
[1:21:54] or a woman a young man or a older man
[1:21:57] praise the
[1:21:58] Lord say I want a life
[1:22:02] change praise the Lord I Want For Christ
[1:22:05] to be made manifest in
[1:22:09] me this thing they talking about about
[1:22:11] the joy of the Lord praise the Lord
[1:22:15] hallelujah you see that's one of the
[1:22:17] thing I can say you know many of our
[1:22:19] young people born around the message is
[1:22:21] robbed off they have really never seen
[1:22:24] the Holy Ghost manifestation because
[1:22:27] they born into a church where there is
[1:22:29] church order everything is kept kind
[1:22:31] they never seen anybody dancing in the
[1:22:33] spirit they really never seen anybody
[1:22:35] speaking in
[1:22:37] tongues and the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:40] so as soon as somebody shout and they
[1:22:42] get uncomfortable to look and and and
[1:22:44] they see somebody jumping up they say
[1:22:46] what's going on it's it's all because I
[1:22:49] mean uh you you be robbed of that
[1:22:57] You' been Rob of
[1:23:01] that but there is a genuine
[1:23:03] manifestation of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:23:06] telling you that can pick you up from
[1:23:07] your seat make you to run around this
[1:23:10] building and you don't even have control
[1:23:12] of yourself there is a true
[1:23:14] manifestation of the Holy
[1:23:16] Ghost that can get a person on their
[1:23:18] feet V in the spirit they don't care
[1:23:21] what you think about them you might get
[1:23:23] in trouble with God
[1:23:32] God our church is getting so quiet and
[1:23:35] de that's the reason why people can come
[1:23:37] and
[1:23:45] sleep are we
[1:23:50] together that's when when Christ
[1:23:56] is being
[1:23:57] formed that's when her persecution
[1:24:00] starts when Christ is about being
[1:24:04] formed in you the hope of glory then all
[1:24:08] hell break
[1:24:11] loose praise the Lord all hell break
[1:24:18] loose are we together
[1:24:24] and that's the kind of a thing I'm
[1:24:25] thinking in my mind I'm saying Lord
[1:24:27] what's what's going on praise the Lord
[1:24:31] sometimes it looks like uh you know uh
[1:24:34] uh uh uh things is getting out of order
[1:24:37] sometimes it's look but you see the the
[1:24:38] enemy brings so much pressure that
[1:24:42] sometimes you even think that I'm am I
[1:24:45] in the way of
[1:24:47] God why is all of this happening to me
[1:24:51] praise the Lord that's the same thing
[1:24:53] that happened to a woman that is having
[1:24:55] a morning
[1:24:56] sickness she just feel like sleeping the
[1:24:59] whole day and it's not
[1:25:01] normal yet she don't know there's a life
[1:25:05] that is forming in
[1:25:08] her praise the
[1:25:12] Lord It's Beginning to change her body
[1:25:16] it's beginning to change the atmosphere
[1:25:18] around her
[1:25:22] life praise the Lord
[1:25:26] you see but for a for a Believer for for
[1:25:29] for a man or a woman that have that I
[1:25:32] mean that that have been down some
[1:25:33] Rocket Road and have had experience with
[1:25:36] God when these things are happening
[1:25:38] around their life they stand back a
[1:25:40] little
[1:25:41] bit praise the Lord you see because the
[1:25:44] first thing there the devil will throw
[1:25:46] it right at you you know I mean you're
[1:25:48] not living right that's what is
[1:25:49] happening to you not serving God right
[1:25:51] that's why all of this is happening to
[1:25:53] you but a man that has been with
[1:25:55] standing with God he
[1:25:57] knows he
[1:25:59] knows that a life is beginning to form
[1:26:03] something is happening that the enemy is
[1:26:05] trying to create a
[1:26:07] distraction to throw me off because
[1:26:10] that's Satan greatest weapon amen that
[1:26:13] his greater weapon if he can make lot of
[1:26:15] noise for you to leave what you are
[1:26:19] doing praise the
[1:26:21] Lord amen
[1:26:24] lot of
[1:26:27] noise as much as we love this cell
[1:26:33] phone they're just
[1:26:38] coming
[1:26:42] distraction just to get your mind
[1:26:45] off that's how he work that his greatest
[1:26:50] tools if he can just create a form of
[1:26:53] distraction
[1:26:57] praise the
[1:26:59] Lord for you to not pay attention to
[1:27:02] that life that is beginning to form in
[1:27:06] you Christ in you the hope of
[1:27:13] glory praise the
[1:27:15] Lord as long as he can get you to the
[1:27:19] place of being a church member that's
[1:27:21] that's that's that's enough that's as
[1:27:22] far as he can bring you and identify
[1:27:24] with a
[1:27:27] church and still play in the things of
[1:27:30] the
[1:27:31] word but when a man or a woman try to
[1:27:34] live a separated
[1:27:37] life praise the
[1:27:40] Lord and you see that's the reason why
[1:27:42] many people are afraid of this Holy
[1:27:45] Ghost
[1:27:47] experience they know that is truth but
[1:27:50] they also know there is a li of
[1:27:56] sacrifice praise the Lord some are
[1:27:59] afraid that you know it might make them
[1:28:02] to L old
[1:28:05] schooled praise the
[1:28:12] Lord let's read on a little
[1:28:15] bit like I said it's just an exhortation
[1:28:18] to encourage
[1:28:20] you amen and I hope you paying attention
[1:28:23] to it
[1:28:24] and when Christ was being formed in Mary
[1:28:28] quickly come the king's commandment all
[1:28:31] you
[1:28:33] people just as she was the Christ was
[1:28:37] becoming a four baby ready to be
[1:28:41] delivered right then a great
[1:28:44] persecution now the baby being formed
[1:28:47] for a long time all alone in the wom but
[1:28:52] this is but this is coming the last day
[1:28:57] when the completion when the fullness of
[1:29:01] the godhead when the fullness of Christ
[1:29:05] is to be manifested among the people
[1:29:09] praise the Lord I mean even Even in our
[1:29:12] home you know I I sang this song this
[1:29:14] this morning and uh we were struggling
[1:29:17] with it right there I don't know why
[1:29:20] Jesus loved me I was lying down on the
[1:29:22] bed all the bed and and I was just I was
[1:29:25] I was listening to uh to something and
[1:29:29] and I was just trying to
[1:29:32] meditate I think I just came from
[1:29:34] studying and I was trying to meditate on
[1:29:36] something and and uh and the thought
[1:29:38] kind of for hit my mind you know uh
[1:29:42] uh
[1:29:46] um and then I started thinking about
[1:29:49] that song you know
[1:29:54] like I said we we get exposed to all of
[1:29:57] this information and we think that we
[1:30:00] have become too
[1:30:01] smart but we have to realize that the
[1:30:05] devil is smarter than us amen you have
[1:30:08] to realize that God is not requiring you
[1:30:11] to be smart either he want you to be a
[1:30:14] believer he want you to be somebody that
[1:30:16] believe his word because no matter how
[1:30:19] smart you are you can now be more
[1:30:21] smarter than the devil praise the Lord
[1:30:24] amen so I was thinking about this and
[1:30:27] and and and I thought about it because
[1:30:29] uh uh I mean like I said I've been down
[1:30:31] that road before you get so religious
[1:30:34] and now you begin to Jorge some ssongs
[1:30:36] you say well you know this song is I
[1:30:38] mean the the whing is not correct I
[1:30:40] don't know why Jesus loved me I mean the
[1:30:42] Myster of God has been revealed because
[1:30:44] I'm his bride that's why he loved me
[1:30:47] praise the Lord you know you you feel
[1:30:50] like that but you really don't know why
[1:30:53] no matter how how much mystery you think
[1:30:55] you know that you are the seed of God
[1:30:57] you are in the mind of
[1:30:59] God the four reason is not yet unfold to
[1:31:05] you praise the
[1:31:08] Lord
[1:31:10] amen and you see some of those songs are
[1:31:13] written from a place of deep
[1:31:17] inspiration Andrew crush is the one that
[1:31:20] wrote the song the same guy that wrote
[1:31:21] through it all he wrote that song
[1:31:26] praise the
[1:31:30] Lord and that boy was a stumbling child
[1:31:33] he couldn't he couldn't even speak out
[1:31:35] one word very straight and uh uh H never
[1:31:38] never never even learned how to play the
[1:31:40] piano you know but he always go with his
[1:31:42] dad you know to meetings and all of that
[1:31:45] it was it was the it was a falling of
[1:31:47] the anointing the Holy Ghost and and in
[1:31:49] the Revival meeting and and all of that
[1:31:51] uh you know and it just brought him to
[1:31:53] the place of of inspiration and giving
[1:31:55] some of those few choruses that we sing
[1:31:57] but but here is the thought that was on
[1:31:59] my
[1:32:00] mind sometimes and many times that is
[1:32:03] the reason why we don't we don't really
[1:32:07] appreciate one
[1:32:11] another amen because we feel like we are
[1:32:15] the better person in a
[1:32:22] relationship now there just take from
[1:32:24] the thought of I don't know why Jesus
[1:32:25] loved me because that was the thought I
[1:32:27] was on my mind that night I was singing
[1:32:29] that song and just worshiping you know
[1:32:32] uh uh just pouring out my heart to God
[1:32:34] crying on the bed and and because we we
[1:32:36] we always think about
[1:32:41] it praise the
[1:32:43] Lord when it comes to we and the Lord
[1:32:47] you will think that every one of us we
[1:32:50] think that you know the Lord in this
[1:32:53] relationship he's better than us amen
[1:32:57] but I will also say the Lord feels the
[1:33:00] same about
[1:33:02] you because if he never got you there is
[1:33:06] no way he will
[1:33:08] manifest what was in his
[1:33:12] mind there is no way he will make
[1:33:14] himself
[1:33:16] known so he feels like he esteemed you
[1:33:20] highly in this relationship
[1:33:24] are we
[1:33:25] together
[1:33:29] amen just like sometimes we think about
[1:33:32] it you know the Lord has been so good to
[1:33:34] me I don't even deserve his Mercy I
[1:33:37] don't even deserve his
[1:33:43] grace and I think in every form of
[1:33:46] relationship if you really sit down and
[1:33:49] look at it in the truth
[1:33:51] sense the man must must be able to say
[1:33:55] to himself that I don't deserve to have
[1:33:58] a wife like
[1:33:59] this the wife must be able to feel is
[1:34:02] not just a statement it must come from a
[1:34:05] deep true
[1:34:10] feeling praise the
[1:34:13] Lord because God with all of these great
[1:34:16] mystery in his mind there is no way he
[1:34:19] could have manifest his attributes until
[1:34:22] he make man in his
[1:34:25] image praise the
[1:34:29] Lord David said in the pm he says he
[1:34:32] said for that sake we have been killed
[1:34:35] all day
[1:34:37] long we are going through what we are
[1:34:40] going through for his
[1:34:43] sake why because he put you here on per
[1:34:47] on this Earth for a purpose and until
[1:34:50] that purpose is fulfilled you going

[1:34:55] teeth he will drag you by the
[1:34:58] teeth nobody else is I'm not going to
[1:35:01] fulfill your purpose you can fulfill
[1:35:08] mine for his
[1:35:10] sake that's why we go through everything
[1:35:13] that we have gone through why because
[1:35:16] the love of God has capture our heart
[1:35:19] and will not allow us to do anything
[1:35:22] contrary to his word
[1:35:25] it is for his
[1:35:29] sake that we cannot go around living in
[1:35:32] adultery than living in in fornication
[1:35:34] it's for his sake you you you even find
[1:35:37] our young people trying to live a decent
[1:35:41] life is for his sake his name
[1:35:47] sake praise the Lord that's why brother
[1:35:50] would say something like God want to
[1:35:52] give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[1:35:58] wanted because he knows what you are
[1:36:00] going through he knows that he has set
[1:36:02] his love upon you you can't get away
[1:36:05] from it you don't even understand
[1:36:09] it you go through things in life you
[1:36:11] don't even understand
[1:36:13] it but because God love you and he's
[1:36:16] determined to save you he's determined
[1:36:19] to change your life
[1:36:23] he put lot of road blocks before you you
[1:36:26] climb over it you he make it more harder
[1:36:29] you climb you jump you fall down he pick
[1:36:31] you up he heals
[1:36:37] you but you see in our filal
[1:36:40] relationship we always think that we are
[1:36:43] the one that deserve the
[1:36:50] better no if you actually start to
[1:36:53] understand understand
[1:36:55] it if you actually start to understand
[1:37:01] it that without that man you wouldn't
[1:37:03] have been a
[1:37:05] mother without that woman you would not
[1:37:07] be a
[1:37:09] father without her you will not be a
[1:37:12] husband without him you will not be a
[1:37:15] wife praise the
[1:37:17] Lord I know we living in a crazy world
[1:37:20] where you can go and buy a a mannequin
[1:37:22] and put it in your house and address it
[1:37:24] but you know you just lying to
[1:37:27] yourself amen you can go down and buy a
[1:37:31] ring and put it on your finger and
[1:37:32] everybody to think that you are married
[1:37:34] you just lying to
[1:37:40] yourself so if you have somebody in your
[1:37:42] life you better realize come to a true
[1:37:46] reality because you see that's what it
[1:37:49] is it's a
[1:37:51] choice that's what the love of God is
[1:37:54] that God will leave everybody and set
[1:37:57] his love upon
[1:38:02] you praise the
[1:38:07] Lord that this woman will leave
[1:38:09] everybody and think their child this is
[1:38:11] the man I want to spend the rest of my
[1:38:13] life to you must say I don't deserve it
[1:38:16] it must bring you to a true
[1:38:19] feeling it's not a it's not an
[1:38:22] expression of appreciation
[1:38:24] it must be a deep TR
[1:38:36] feeling God has a
[1:38:39] go say one God one God but he manifested
[1:38:44] in three four
[1:38:46] purpose that one gold was the one
[1:38:49] mystery that Christ will be formed in
[1:38:52] you
[1:38:54] that's the hope of glory that's the hope
[1:38:57] of a
[1:38:58] millennium that's the hope of 1,000
[1:39:03] years are we
[1:39:08] together we come so short because we use
[1:39:12] the very little knowledge that we have
[1:39:15] we read the Bible and H understand very
[1:39:18] little thing and then we just surround
[1:39:19] our entire brain around that thing and
[1:39:22] you think that you really know
[1:39:27] God and sometimes it put us to the place
[1:39:30] that can be a by place because it
[1:39:32] becomes a religious spirit a really true
[1:39:35] spirit of God will give you the desire
[1:39:38] to know more of
[1:39:43] God praise the
[1:39:46] Lord but when you come to the place and
[1:39:48] you think that there is nothing more you
[1:39:51] need to learn I already know that before
[1:39:54] the preacher open his mouth you already
[1:39:56] know where he's going I'm telling you
[1:39:59] you running without a message I have the
[1:40:01] message wait for me to
[1:40:10] learn well you see why we have all of
[1:40:12] these things around our
[1:40:14] life you just sit there sit there sit
[1:40:17] there and think about your own
[1:40:21] life why have we gone from one one
[1:40:23] trouble to another
[1:40:26] trouble why look in this book and and
[1:40:30] and talk about the children of that's
[1:40:32] the reason why the the the you know the
[1:40:34] the the unconverted Jews frown with the
[1:40:37] story in this
[1:40:38] book because if they are called God's
[1:40:41] people they have been surrounded with
[1:40:43] captivity slavery
[1:40:51] bondage actually they were God people
[1:40:53] that should be living in Hollywood and
[1:40:55] in the best mansion that's what

[1:58:45] he said when Paul met the Philippian
[1:58:47] Jailer he told him what he must do
[1:58:53] when we spend too much time telling the
[1:58:55] people what we must now do that's when
[1:58:57] we preach a condemning message we
[1:58:59] condemn everything we condemn
[1:59:02] everything but we must be able to engage
[1:59:06] ourself are we
[1:59:10] together make us to see the spiritual
[1:59:13] reality that is that is around
[1:59:18] us Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:59:25] amen Christ want to make himself
[1:59:27] manifested in
[1:59:31] you that's his
[1:59:35] desire that's the reason why he's
[1:59:37] creating the hungering and the
[1:59:40] thirsting the more Cay for God and and
[1:59:44] uh uh uh the allowing things to come for
[1:59:46] us to seek his face and get
[1:59:49] closer there a life that we are carrying
[1:59:51] Within
[1:59:53] Us Praise the
[1:59:56] Lord there's a life that we are carrying
[1:59:59] within
[2:00:14] us let's read one more thing yeah we
[2:00:16] were close I get through AAS toight and
[2:00:21] we find another time I just wanted to
[2:00:23] encourage you after this prayer meeting
[2:00:26] we have this
[2:00:27] morning and
[2:00:32] uh you know you think right there in in
[2:00:35] recognizing your de in this message
[2:00:37] brother was talking about how uh uh uh
[2:00:42] uh back in uh uh
[2:00:46] 1958 you know he was talking about how
[2:00:49] the Revival was going around and all the
[2:00:51] people were saying pra pray pray pray
[2:00:52] pray pray pray pray pray pray he says uh
[2:00:55] he says uh uh uh you know they were they
[2:00:58] were expecting something you know they
[2:01:00] were all wanting you know that God will
[2:01:03] send a Revival God would send he says
[2:01:05] but it didn't realize that it has
[2:01:07] already
[2:01:09] happen amen and I I was thinking about
[2:01:12] that but the reason why I was thinking
[2:01:14] about that not in not in that line the
[2:01:15] most but it is mostly at a place where
[2:01:18] that you know just like I said you know
[2:01:21] prayer is a bir burden the people Hearts
[2:01:23] has to be burdened the people has to
[2:01:25] bring their burden you know I mean you
[2:01:28] cannot you cannot just get people on an
[2:01:31] atmosphere and then you should uh uh
[2:01:33] let's pray pray pray pray pray loud pray
[2:01:35] pray let's just pray then you know I
[2:01:37] mean as if to say we selling something
[2:01:39] in a in the street
[2:01:41] market we must have something we commit
[2:01:43] to the Lord and we must engage ourself
[2:01:47] praise the Lord amen and if we don't
[2:01:51] have one we must not manufacture
[2:01:57] one are we together now so let's take
[2:02:01] this one
[2:02:02] adoption that will be my uh uh somewhere
[2:02:06] down there how that God has set some in
[2:02:10] the church through their labor pains oh
[2:02:13] they get tra tremendous sometimes when
[2:02:17] the church is groaning under the
[2:02:20] persecution of the word praise the lord
[2:02:25] of the outside word Believing on the
[2:02:28] Lord Jesus that that the promise of the
[2:02:30] Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it
[2:02:34] was to Pentecost how they groan and
[2:02:39] cried on the labor pains praise the Lord
[2:02:45] amen how they groan and cry on the labor
[2:02:48] pains that's like like I said as many of
[2:02:50] us we I mean we have been robbed we we
[2:02:53] we you know we we uh born around uh uh a
[2:02:57] message church we grow in we know Church
[2:03:00] order and uh and and it's it's so easy
[2:03:03] for us to be critical and and then
[2:03:06] sometimes uh uh some of our uh uh saints
[2:03:10] that God will bless and bring into the
[2:03:13] Fai that you know uh that uh had uh you
[2:03:16] know uh the experience of the Lord
[2:03:19] sometimes many of them also you know
[2:03:22] become become shocked I'm I'm saying
[2:03:24] this because you know uh I was I was
[2:03:27] having u a conversation with uh with a d
[2:03:30] sin yesterday we were talking on
[2:03:32] something and uh you know I was just I
[2:03:35] was just trying to to uh you know trying
[2:03:40] to encourage uh the individual I was
[2:03:43] talking to and because you see like I
[2:03:48] said people coming you you you see the
[2:03:51] church order and and all of that and
[2:03:53] then it puts you to the place where uh
[2:03:56] uh sometimes it's almost like uh uh you
[2:04:00] know you you you feel a little bit
[2:04:02] starching you know you feel a little bit
[2:04:05] uh uh uh uh H lock in you know and then
[2:04:09] you know yeah brother BR talking about
[2:04:11] one year groaning under uh uh the
[2:04:16] persecution and now you will you realize
[2:04:18] that uh uh uh you read the book book of
[2:04:22] Acts and you read uh you see how uh uh
[2:04:25] uh that year is is kind of a type in a
[2:04:28] way of of labor pains and sometimes
[2:04:32] that's that's how you know some people
[2:04:33] are designed you know there are people
[2:04:35] that grown in the spirit if you if you
[2:04:37] reality you have not experienced that
[2:04:39] before you know uh uh it's it's a kind
[2:04:42] of a thing where you uh the person has a
[2:04:47] constant burden on their heart that
[2:04:48] don't go away from them sometimes I mean
[2:04:52] uh uh the least mov they have to close
[2:04:55] their eyes they just get to that place I
[2:04:57] mean you are so groaning that you can't
[2:05:00] you you can't you don't have enough
[2:05:02] words you know to be able to say what uh
[2:05:06] you ever see somebody in pains and they
[2:05:08] are
[2:05:13] just I mean they cannot express the
[2:05:16] level of pains that they are dealing
[2:05:18] with praise the Lord amen they can't
[2:05:22] express it I mean they are they are so
[2:05:23] locked in this pain I mean and and and
[2:05:26] and all they can do is to just grab
[2:05:28] their teeth together and just and just
[2:05:31] grown and and just
[2:05:36] oh praise the Lord trying to contain the
[2:05:40] pain and and and and and and also trying
[2:05:43] to contain their cried and and uh and
[2:05:46] and and sometimes people do that in the
[2:05:50] spirit you know sometimes people do that
[2:05:52] in the
[2:05:54] spirit I remember uh uh years back when
[2:05:58] I was
[2:05:59] traveling and sometimes I I'll be there
[2:06:02] I I just uh you know I say oh
[2:06:05] God and the brother will say what
[2:06:08] happened you know he would think that uh
[2:06:12] uh maybe I'm worrying about something
[2:06:14] and uh uh uh but my my heart is just my
[2:06:19] mind is just in such a place
[2:06:22] praise the Lord amen you know when Paul
[2:06:26] talk about uh pray without season you
[2:06:29] can really pray without ceasing if you
[2:06:31] learn to grown in the
[2:06:33] spirit you can pray without
[2:06:36] ceasing because you just carrying that
[2:06:38] thing in your mind you carrying that
[2:06:41] thing on your
[2:06:43] heart but here he's talking about labor
[2:06:46] pains how they grown and cry on the
[2:06:50] pains
[2:06:51] but when they are born and positionally
[2:06:55] born in the kingdom of God then the Holy
[2:06:57] Ghost has set in the church some to be
[2:07:00] Apostles prophets now he's talking about
[2:07:03] how gifts are born and he gives into
[2:07:06] their speaking with tongues
[2:07:08] interpretation of tongues knowledge and
[2:07:11] wisdom you know I was talking to a
[2:07:13] friend another brother I says you see uh
[2:07:16] uh because of the margin of error that
[2:07:19] we have had around the churches
[2:07:22] it makes people try to suppress
[2:07:24] spiritual
[2:07:26] gift
[2:07:28] amen but God still give his people
[2:07:31] spiritual
[2:07:32] gift praise the Lord God still people
[2:07:35] give gift I mean still give people the
[2:07:37] GI of Prophecy the GI of speaking in
[2:07:39] tongues and interpretation of tongues I
[2:07:41] remember the other year that I was over
[2:07:43] in UK after preaching uh uh a Sunday
[2:07:46] service I I I could tell that this that
[2:07:49] that young that sister I I could tell
[2:07:52] that uh I mean uh uh uh uh that was that
[2:07:55] was just not a message breed amen I
[2:07:58] could tell that this was somebody that
[2:08:00] had the holy ghost that loved the Lord
[2:08:03] they believe the message praise the Lord
[2:08:05] because I mean right after the the
[2:08:07] service we got through praying and and
[2:08:10] you could just feel the atmosphere in
[2:08:11] the building and and I mean she was just
[2:08:14] all over the place lifting up her hands
[2:08:16] her High his shoes was somewhere else
[2:08:18] she was just prophesying and bringing
[2:08:20] the word of the Lord you know that this
[2:08:22] person has an experience with
[2:08:26] God praise the Lord but you see we
[2:08:29] become so
[2:08:31] sted we become so sted that we even we
[2:08:34] even hold ourself back from
[2:08:38] crying the god of Heaven that we
[2:08:40] supposed to cry to we hold ourself back
[2:08:43] from crying we don't want to
[2:08:49] cry we become so excellent in in our
[2:08:53] words we speaking grammar to God nouns
[2:08:56] and
[2:09:11] pronouns but at
[2:09:13] Birth God designed it at
[2:09:17] Birth when birth is about to come he
[2:09:20] designed it
[2:09:22] that both the mother and the baby of
[2:09:25] Christ he designed it when God is about
[2:09:29] to bring birth to a
[2:09:32] church both the church the preaching of
[2:09:36] the word the singing of the
[2:09:40] songs the people boss out in crying they
[2:09:44] Worship the Lord in tears they cry when
[2:09:46] the word is preached they cry when they
[2:09:49] prayed you know that life is about about
[2:09:51] to come that's the way that God designed
[2:09:55] it see this pretty woman she gets to the
[2:09:58] hospital she's smiling with everybody
[2:09:59] she happy that she's about to give
[2:10:02] birth when that pain starts to come she
[2:10:06] know she face her hair so
[2:10:09] nice when she gets on her labor
[2:10:14] pains that hair she took so much time to
[2:10:17] to fix she grab
[2:10:19] it she throw it everything
[2:10:23] away nothing matter to her she want to
[2:10:26] bring life what matter to her is that
[2:10:29] life is for that life to come
[2:10:38] forth praise the
[2:10:44] Lord musicians you can
[2:10:49] come that's my encouragement to
[2:10:57] you Christ in
[2:10:59] you the hope of
[2:11:03] glory if you just allow that
[2:11:06] word to take its place in your life
[2:11:09] allow that word to take its place in
[2:11:11] your
[2:11:13] home allow that
[2:11:15] word to have the
[2:11:19] preeminence and when things are
[2:11:22] happening you will not be quick to find
[2:11:26] the rots that are running around the
[2:11:28] house you know that the devil trying to
[2:11:31] create some

[2:11:38] trying to do create some distraction to
[2:11:41] get off off off
[2:11:42] course praise the Lord make this one to
[2:11:46] fall and make this one to hurt and you

[2:11:54] put this church on fire whatever he want
[2:11:56] to do he want to create distraction he
[2:11:59] want to get us away from the
[2:12:03] word but if we know that and we identify
[2:12:08] that then that's the time where we have
[2:12:10] to put in more time to consecrate
[2:12:16] ourself he's creating distraction around
[2:12:18] your home making your little ones to be

[2:16:54] that
[2:16:56] whenever we have a
[2:17:01] [Music]
[2:17:07] situation and we can be able to realize
[2:17:09] that it's the enemy trying to create a
[2:17:12] distraction whether in our
[2:17:15] home that's that that is the thing
[2:17:17] sometimes that is difficult for us
[2:17:20] sometimes we realize
[2:17:21] sometimes sometimes the Holy Ghost is
[2:17:23] going to just whisper in our ears and
[2:17:27] say watch up now the devil trying to
[2:17:28] create a
[2:17:30] distraction but we we we turn to hold to
[2:17:34] our ground there you know I'm not
[2:17:37] foolish you can't talk to me like this
[2:17:39] and uh uh and sometimes we even create
[2:17:43] that behavior in the house of
[2:17:45] God to realize that it's it's it's just
[2:17:49] the enemy
[2:17:50] and uh Jesus said blessed is he that is
[2:17:53] not offended in me we can't take offense

[2:18:31] the in in in in in the in in the body
[2:18:34] when life is coming in the
[2:18:37] body the body itself gets under pressure

[2:18:46] entered into the
[2:18:47] body when you get something pick into
[2:18:50] your finger the body gets under pressure
[2:18:53] it send signal to the
[2:18:55] brain the brain is trying to figure out
[2:18:58] what is this thing that is that is
[2:19:01] introduced in this body and that's the
[2:19:04] same way
[2:19:06] our sometimes we are a light to that
[2:19:09] sometimes we are not a light to that we
[2:19:11] try to look for the next person to blame
[2:19:13] we try to look for the next person to F
[2:19:16] with we f with the children we f with

[2:21:37] that is beginning to be birthing
[2:21:40] you he's trying to create some kind of a
[2:21:44] distraction so you can get from your

[2:29:42] Lord you know we were we were worshiping
[2:29:46] singing earlier before we started
[2:29:48] preaching
[2:29:51] and uh I so
[2:29:54] uh uh sister now in worshiping
[2:29:58] there and I just it just kind of for
[2:30:02] blessed my heart you know because uh
[2:30:05] sometimes you will you know we know our
[2:30:08] situation and and we don't know other
[2:30:10] people's situation I had a privilege to
[2:30:13] go through her house
[2:30:15] yesterday and so that she had a real
[2:30:17] fire more than me I had a smoke
[2:30:20] you know we got some of the kitchen
[2:30:23] burned but her house will have burned
[2:30:26] down burned down if it was not the grace
[2:30:30] of
[2:30:31] God you know so I think that was that
[2:30:35] was lot of strength and Grace from the
[2:30:37] Lord for her to have that
[2:30:40] expression because uh you know you look
[2:30:43] at Job
