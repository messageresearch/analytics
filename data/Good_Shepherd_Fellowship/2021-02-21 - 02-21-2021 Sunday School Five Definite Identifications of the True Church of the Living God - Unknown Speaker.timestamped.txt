[2:43] 24 46
[2:45] let's begin with the 46th verse and he
[2:48] said unto them
[2:49] thus it is written and thus it behoove
[2:51] christ to suffer
[2:53] and arise from the dead the third day
[2:56] and that repentance and remission
[3:00] of sins
[3:03] well i want that to soak in because i'm
[3:04] coming to you something in a minute on
[3:06] that
[3:07] remission of sins
[3:10] repentance towards god and remitting of
[3:13] sins
[3:14] should be preached in his name
[3:18] among all nations
[3:21] beginning at jerusalem and ye
[3:24] are witnesses of these things
[3:28] suffer said the scriptures he's the one
[3:31] the prophet spoke of
[3:33] he's the one the whole bible turned
[3:34] around uh involved around him
[3:37] surely he didn't know what ought to be
[3:39] taught he didn't know what ought to be
[3:40] done
[3:41] and he said repentance and remission of
[3:44] sins
[3:44] must be preached to all nations

[3:51] amen now organization begin at rome
[3:57] organization church begin at rome come

[4:03] wesley on to the united states for john
[4:06] smith
[4:08] california for pentecost
[4:12] but the church begin at jerusalem
[4:16] repentance towards god and the baptism
[4:19] in the name of jesus christ for a
[4:20] remission of sins
[4:22] begin at jerusalem and should
[4:26] should he said didn't said it all reach
[4:28] it it should begin
[4:31] it should go to all the world it should
[4:33] be preached

[4:37] what he said
[4:38] its message that's the message of the
[4:40] church show me the church's teaching
[4:45] tell me where it's at
[4:49] you don't find me now jesus is
[4:52] king the second message jesus is king
[4:56] and is alive forevermore matthew
[5:00] 28 20 jesus is king and alive
[5:04] forever that's what the church should
[5:08] teach
[5:10] matthew 28 20 teaching them to observe
[5:14] all things whatsoever i have commanded
[5:17] you and lo
[5:18] i am with you always even unto the end
[5:21] of the world is that right
[5:26] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same
[5:31] yesterday today and forever
[5:35] that's the message of the church
[5:40] doing his work proving his resurrection
[5:43] and giving witnesses
[5:45] now acts 5 32
[5:48] where we see whether they had it or not
[5:53] as returned acts fifth chapter 32nd
[5:56] verse
[5:57] and we are his witnesses
[6:01] of these things and so is also the holy
[6:04] ghost
[6:05] whom god has given to them that
[6:08] obey him he's got to be witness
[6:13] john 14 12 he gives a teaching
[6:16] what the church should do in john the
[6:19] 14th chapter
[6:20] the and the 12th verse
[6:24] we'll see what that says john 14
[6:27] 12. so we read it
[6:30] make it official all right john
[6:34] 14 and the 12th first verily verily
[6:38] i say unto you he that believeth on me
[6:41] the works that i do shall he do also
[6:44] and greater works than these do he do
[6:46] because i go to my father
[6:49] that's the message of the church jesus
[6:53] christ the same yesterday forever
[6:55] living in the church king of the church
[6:57] raised from the dead
[6:58] same yesterday and forever performing
[7:00] the same works doing the same
[7:02] things that jesus did that's the message
[7:04] of the church
[7:06] if the church isn't teaching that he's
[7:08] teaching some false theology
[7:09] amen that's why jesus commanded him to
[7:12] preach
[7:14] what else will be how we know whether
[7:16] these people they say well
[7:18] i'm a believer let's see what his last
[7:20] commission was to his church for
[7:21] believers
[7:22] mark 16.
[7:26] take mark the 16th chapter and we'll
[7:29] find out what his last message was to
[7:30] the church
[7:31] and we'll see then whether we're
[7:33] following out his commission
[7:35] mark 16 let's begin the 14th verse
[7:38] after he appeared unto the eleven that's
[7:41] after his resurrection
[7:42] as they sat at me here's the commission
[7:45] to the church now listen
[7:46] the last commission will check ourselves
[7:48] whether we're believers or were we in
[7:50] this church or not
[7:52] after he appeared unto the leaven as he
[7:54] said it meet and afraid to them with the
[7:56] hardness of their heart
[7:57] without their unbelief and hardness of
[7:59] heart because they believed
[8:02] not them which had seen him after his
[8:04] resurrect after he was risen
[8:07] somebody had seen him somebody was
[8:09] trying to tell him about it
[8:11] and they did not believe it if that
[8:14] isn't the same thing today
[8:16] we know he lives we have the witness of
[8:19] his spirit in us
[8:21] we see his power move over the audiences
[8:23] and tens of thousands of people
[8:25] and discern their thoughts thoughts and
[8:28] hearts just exactly like he did when he
[8:30] was shared
[8:31] like the bible said the word of god if
[8:33] he is the word of god
[8:34] in the beginning was the word award is
[8:36] with god and the word was made flesh and
[8:37] dwelt among us
[8:39] the word of god is sharper more powerful
[8:41] than a two-aged sword
[8:43] cutting even to the mirror the bone and
[8:45] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[8:47] of the heart
[8:48] christ the works that i do shall you
[8:51] also
[8:52] see him doing that how many seen him do
[8:54] it am i
[8:56] sure we know he does it he lives here
[8:59] he's in our hearts
[9:02] they don't believe it they didn't
[9:04] believe it then they don't believe it
[9:05] now they believe he died and that
[9:06] settled
[9:07] we got a some kind of a historical thing
[9:09] that some fellow raised up a few years
[9:11] ago and established the church and
[9:12] wrote a catechism and that's what we
[9:14] hold on to that's pagan
[9:16] amen right no truth to that
[9:19] oh i don't say truth the man might have
[9:21] done it man might have been ever so
[9:23] sincere
[9:23] but god doesn't control his church like
[9:25] that he never did want it
[9:27] when they asked for a king samuel called
[9:30] him and said this
[9:31] he said i want to ask you something have
[9:34] i ever failed you
[9:35] have i ever asked you for any of your
[9:37] money have i
[9:39] ever told you anything in the name of
[9:40] the lord but what was right
[9:42] god don't want you to have a king he
[9:44] wants to be your king
[9:45] he said oh samuel sure you're right
[9:47] you're a good prophet
[9:48] you've never told us nothing but the
[9:50] truth you've never begged us for money
[9:52] them things are true but we want to be
[9:54] like the rest of them
[9:56] we want a king anyhow samuel said it's
[9:58] going to cause your heartaches and
[9:59] troubles
[10:00] it's going to take your sons and
[10:01] daughters he's going to pollute him and
[10:03] the things he'll do he'll do it and he
[10:05] did
[10:07] but still they wanted a king that's way
[10:10] today oh we've got to have some kind of
[10:12] a name attached to us
[10:13] we got to tell the people when they
[10:14] asked us where methodist baptists just
[10:16] say you're christians
[10:18] that's right christ sign
[10:22] after he had risen from the dead they
[10:24] didn't believe it and he said unto them
[10:26] what's the great commission
[10:28] go ye into how much the world
[10:32] or i thought just jerusalem
[10:36] somebody said these signs only went to
[10:38] jerusalem
[10:39] all the world and preached the
[10:43] gospel how many knows what the gospel is
[10:47] not the word paul said the gospel come
[10:50] to us not in word only
[10:52] but through the power and manifestation
[10:54] of the holy ghost
[10:55] the gospel is the power of god to make
[10:58] the word act what it says it'll do
[11:00] amen preach the gospel
[11:04] all the world preach the gospel to
[11:07] just the white people or just the brown
[11:12] yellow black to every creature

[11:23] seen god baffle the bull one day

[11:29] i've seen him raise up a possum have
[11:30] been laying dead all night
[11:33] every creature amen the gospel will
[11:37] take effect upon anything that you ask
[11:40] you say that's wrong brother blame it
[11:42] isn't wrong
[11:44] jesus said to that tree curse it be you
[11:46] no man eat from you from henceforth
[11:47] and the gospel was preached to that tree
[11:51] amen i feel religious right now
[11:59] amen preach it to whatever creature

[13:02] or not they might say they believe
[13:05] jesus said these signs will follow them
[13:07] that believe that's right

[13:14] these signs shall follow them and
[13:16] believe how much
[13:19] in my name they shall cast out devils

[13:33] exclaim that you believe in god
[13:36] and believe in the commission that your
[13:38] church is commissioned to take the
[13:39] gospel the very first thing is divine

[13:45] disciples when he sent him out
[13:47] matthew 10 1 heal the sick cast on

[14:17] just as jerusalem to all the world and
[14:20] to every creature

[14:26] that is the message of the church
[14:30] hallelujah all the world every creature
[14:34] the gospel that everyone that believes
[14:37] these signs shall follow my name they
[14:39] shall cast out devils
[14:41] they shall speak with new tongues and
[14:44] you poor nazarenes
[14:46] called him a bunch of tongues people you
[14:48] wouldn't even sit in church with him
[14:51] ain't that awful what are you gonna do
[14:53] when you get to heaven
[14:54] jesus died speaking in time
[14:59] they said he spoke and he spoke in
[15:01] another language she sure he did
[15:04] he spoke in hebrew he did not that's not
[15:06] hebrew writing
[15:08] he spoke in a heavenly language
[15:12] when abel offered his lamb on the rock
[15:14] when the little lamb was dying is
[15:16] happening on the neck
[15:17] a type of christ way back in the garden
[15:19] of eden the little lamb bleeding
[15:22] in another language as he was dying it
[15:25] typed as his bloody wool being bathed
[15:27] with his own blood
[15:28] it typed the son of god hanging on wrong
[15:31] calvary chopped to pieces
[15:33] with our sins dying speaking in another
[15:36] language
[15:37] oh my god why has thou forsaken me
[15:41] that's the message of the church they
[15:44] shall cast out devils they shall speak
[15:46] with new tongues
[15:48] thank you lord that's what he said
[15:50] that's the message of the church that's
[15:51] what he command the church to do
[15:53] so cast out devils they shall speak with
[15:56] new tongues
[15:59] they shall take up serpents and if they
[16:01] drink a deadly thing it shall not harm
[16:03] them
[16:03] they lay hands on the sick they shall
[16:06] recover
[16:09] that's the commission of the church
[16:11] that's a real believing church
[16:13] is that part of the methodist baptist
[16:16] presbyterian
[16:18] catholic lutheran nazarene no pilgrim
[16:22] holiness
[16:23] no sir they did not
[16:26] glory why they're organized and they
[16:30] can't do it
[16:31] there's a many member in there that
[16:32] believes that
[16:34] but he can't say nothing about it
[16:35] because he'll be excommunicated
[16:38] that's an antichrist spirit god of
[16:40] mauryan
[16:41] the church of the living god is freeborn
[16:46] don't need any domination follow the
[16:49] king
[16:51] of the messianic kingdom they don't have
[16:54] to take the people saying
[16:56] they're pre-born made free by the sun
[16:58] who makes them free indeed
[17:00] these signs shall follow this gospel
[17:03] shall be preached
[17:05] who's going to preach it god's able to
[17:07] take the ignorance
[17:08] god's able to rise up stones to children
[17:12] god can do whatever he wants to do he's
[17:14] god
[17:16] that's the way he does it when he come
[17:18] he never called
[17:19] camphysis he never called one priest
[17:22] he never called one theologian he took
[17:25] fishermen
[17:26] herdsmen and they're ignorant and
[17:28] unlearned
[17:29] the bible said that peter and john were
[17:32] both
[17:32] ignorant and unlearned but he could get
[17:35] down
[17:36] and work through them the kingdom of god
[17:39] and confound the eyes
[17:41] and the minds of the wise almighty they
[17:44] said they're talking if they were
[17:45] injured and unlearned man
[17:47] but had to take heed to them that they
[17:48] had been with jesus
[17:51] why they had his spirit on them
[17:55] they were acting like he acted they were
[17:58] doing the things that
[18:11] these signs shall follow them that
[18:14] believe
[18:15] certainly signs of following now
[18:18] another thing this church will teach
[18:21] will be to find healing
[18:23] the message of the church i just quoted
[18:25] it matthew 10
[18:27] when he sent his church out let's just
[18:29] go to matthew 10 1 and find out just a
[18:31] minute
[18:32] watch what jesus said when he ordained
[18:34] his church and started out
[18:36] and then he called unto him his twelve
[18:39] disciples
[18:40] and gave them power against unclean
[18:43] spirits to
[18:44] cast out cast them out and to heal all
[18:47] manner of sickness and all manner of
[18:48] diseases
[18:50] the first commission to his church
[18:53] the last commission go into all the
[18:56] world
[18:57] preach the gospel he that believeth is
[18:59] baptized let me quote it the way it
[19:01] should be the way it's broke down going
[19:04] into all the world
[19:05] into every nation and demonstrate the
[19:08] power of the holy ghost
[19:10] he that leaveth on this and is baptized
[19:13] shall be saved he that denies it will be
[19:16] damned
[19:17] these signs shall follow them that
[19:19] believe they lay hands on the sick they
[19:21] shall recover they'll cast out devils
[19:23] you'll speak with new tongues
[19:24] this will be the signs that follows the
[19:27] last verse said and they return
[19:29] the lord working with them confirming
[19:31] his word with signs following
[19:35] that's the way the first church was and
[19:37] listen
[19:38] jesus said i am the vine ye are the
[19:41] branches
[19:43] and if a branch brings forth the vine
[19:46] and that vine bears grapes
[19:48] the next branch comes forth it'll bear
[19:50] just like the first brainstem
[19:53] oh you say brother branham but we look
[19:55] at all these churches that's
[19:56] grafted vines
[19:59] how you can graft citrus fruit you can
[20:02] take an
[20:03] orange tree and put a lemon on it and
[20:04] it'll grow
[20:06] that's what you man grafted in and these
[20:09] organizations
[20:10] is what man grafted in it's a lemon all
[20:13] the time
[20:14] it'll grow because it's stuck out in the
[20:16] church name
[20:18] but let me tell you if that tree ever
[20:20] puts forth another branch itself
[20:22] it'll bear an orange and if the power of
[20:26] god ever puts forth another church it'll
[20:27] be another pentecost and another book of
[20:30] acts will be right behind it
[20:34] because it's a church of god jesus said
[20:36] i'm the vine you're the branches
[20:39] you cannot bear fruit in yourself but i
[20:41] throw my own self into the branch
[20:43] and what kind of fruit did it bear these
[20:45] signs shall
[20:46] follow them that believe the second
[20:49] church rises up the mystical body of
[20:51] christ will have the same signs
[20:54] yet a little while the world seath be no
[20:56] more yet ye shall see me
[20:58] for i will be with you even in you
[21:02] and every branch to the end of the world
[21:06] jesus christ is saying yesterday today
[21:09] and forever
[21:10] that's the church of the living god
[21:13] that's who it is
[21:14] yeah that's the kind of witnesses he has
[21:17] now also the church must teach baptism
[21:22] it must be baptized that was a
[21:24] commission jesus said here in mark 16
[21:25] we'll just use it
[21:27] he that believeth and is baptized
[21:31] believe first and then be baptized for
[21:34] the remission of your sins
[21:36] and you shall receive the gift of the
[21:37] holy ghost and the holy ghost
[21:40] will also come upon there will be a
[21:43] teaching of the church
[21:45] where jesus said in luke 24 49 we're
[21:48] right close to it so let's just turn to
[21:49] it
[21:50] just a second the 49th verse here we
[21:52] read that 46-47
[21:54] look at the 49 and behold i send the
[21:56] promise of my father
[21:58] upon you but carry ye our weight tarry
[22:00] means wait
[22:01] in the city of jerusalem until you're
[22:03] endued with power from on high
[22:05] if christ would not let a bunch of men
[22:08] who would walk with him for three and a
[22:09] half years
[22:10] go preach any gospel or could not preach
[22:12] any gospel
[22:13] until they waited for the holy ghost the
[22:16] church today has to do the same thing
[22:19] wait for the holy ghost amen
[22:23] i was talking to a catholic lady you're
[22:25] not long ago
[22:26] in an organ and she said well you mean
[22:28] to tell me
[22:30] that that bunch of idiots down there
[22:33] where he was preaching and screaming and
[22:34] crying
[22:35] going on like that do you mean that
[22:37] they'll be in a heaven and rule in
[22:39] heaven
[22:40] i said yes ma'am
[22:43] she said well we don't believe in such
[22:46] stuff i said because you don't believe
[22:47] the word of god
[22:49] and she said we believe that mary
[22:51] intercedes for us
[22:52] i said that's absolutely heathen
[22:57] she never was a goddess she's a woman
[23:00] mother of god how could god have a
[23:01] mother
[23:03] hail mary mother of god how could god
[23:06] have a mother
[23:07] she bore the son of god christ jesus
[23:10] no woman is a creator she holds the seat
[23:14] of a man
[23:15] the man's not a creator god creates a
[23:18] life
[23:20] it's just a routine of order that god
[23:22] put to bring children
[23:24] she's no mother of god god can't have a
[23:27] mother because he had no beginning of
[23:28] days or ending of life
[23:30] he's a town she can't be a mother of god
[23:33] now i said what if i tell you that your
[23:35] blessed virgin that you looked you as a
[23:37] goddess
[23:38] what if i tell you that god wouldn't let
[23:40] her come to heaven until she acted like
[23:42] that people did last night
[23:45] [Applause]
[23:47] she said that's not right i said did you
[23:50] tell me the catholic church wrote the
[23:51] bible
[23:52] the apostles and you said they were
[23:54] catholic i defy
[23:55] that there knows no catholic church for
[23:59] 300 years
[24:00] after the death of the last apostle go
[24:02] after the night seeing counsel
[24:04] show me page history anything you want
[24:06] to not your catechism because it don't
[24:08] compare with history
[24:10] that's right there was such a thing but
[24:12] i said that mary
[24:14] the bible said that mary the mother of
[24:17] jesus and the rest of the women
[24:19] with 120 all had to climb those steps to
[24:22] the upper room
[24:23] and be filled with the holy ghost until
[24:25] they staggered like they were
[24:26] drunk speaking in tongues and acting
[24:29] like a bunch of drunkards
[24:32] that's what the bible said i put my
[24:35] finger on the verse and i said read it
[24:36] she said i don't want to read it
[24:38] i'm not supposed to read it i said
[24:39] you're not honest
[24:42] here's where virgin mary received the
[24:44] holy ghost and spoke in tongues and
[24:46] staggered like a drunk one
[24:49] now if you go to heaven you can't go
[24:50] with her because she had to receive the
[24:53] holy ghost and if she had to do that
[24:55] being the mother of jesus christ
[24:56] how much more do you require
[25:00] she said if i had to go to heaven with
[25:02] anything like that
[25:03] i would want to be in heaven i said you
[25:05] don't have much to worry about i don't
[25:06] think you're going anywhere
[25:11] don't think you have much to be bothered
[25:13] about it that's exactly
[25:15] god's spirit now you're a witness to me
[25:19] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[25:21] now what is this now what are we saying
[25:24] what is it who set it up and what is its
[25:27] message
[25:28] now to hurry up to get just a little
[25:30] farther along
[25:31] the fourth thing
[25:35] how do we become a member of it how do
[25:38] we join it
[25:40] we see what it is now what how do we
[25:43] join this church

[26:04] a son of god or a daughter of god
[26:07] let us take john the third chapter
[26:11] just a moment and just see what god said
[26:15] here about it
[26:16] how do you get into this church
[26:19] what's the proposition god offers you

[26:23] the third chapter one day there was a
[26:26] man of the pharisees named nicodemus

[26:30] jesus by night and said to him rabbi
[26:33] we don't are a teacher come from god no
[26:36] man can do the miracles which thou doest
[26:38] except god be with him
[26:39] jesus answered and said to him fairly i
[26:41] say unto thee except the man be
[26:43] born again verily i say unto thee
[26:47] except the man be born again he cannot
[26:50] see the kingdom of god
[26:53] how do you get into it born into it

[26:57] naked even said unto him how can a man
[27:00] be born when he's old

[27:06] priest

[27:12] womb

[27:19] sent you except the man be born
[27:21] of water how do we get into it
[27:26] of water and of spirit he cannot
[27:29] enter into the kingdom of god

[27:50] born again the wind blow worthlessness
[27:53] thou cannot tell the sound thereof but
[27:55] cannot tell whence it come or whether it
[27:57] goeth

[28:01] see you don't join it
[28:03] it's a mysterious thing amen you're born
[28:06] into the mystical body of christ

[28:18] out if i possibly can if you just i know
[28:20] it's hot but let's start here just a
[28:22] minute
[28:23] first corinthians the 12th chapter
[28:26] the 13th verse
[28:29] four by one handshake
[28:37] by one vowel i vow to believe in the
[28:40] great holy roman church
[28:44] come shake my hands put your name on the
[28:45] book buy one letter come by letter
[28:50] you might read that in the old lady's
[28:51] birthday almanac but you don't read it
[28:53] in god's bible
[28:54] yes sir four by one
[28:58] spirit are we all joined
[29:03] recorded baptized
[29:06] into one organization
[29:10] one body which is the body of christ
[29:13] whether we be jews our gentiles whether
[29:16] we be
[29:16] bond or free and have been made
[29:20] all made to drink of one
[29:24] spirit not methodist spirit baptist
[29:27] spirit
[29:28] pentecostal spirit but by one holy
[29:31] spirit we have all been baptized
[29:35] into this fountain filled with blood
[29:39] drawn from emmanuel's veins where
[29:42] sinners plunged beneath the flood lose
[29:44] all their guilty stains
[29:46] the dying thief rejoiced to see that
[29:48] fountain in his day
[29:50] there they are though as he wash all
[29:53] my sins away one body how do we come
[29:57] into that body
[29:58] how we get into it by one spirit
[30:02] hallelujah we're baptized into one body
[30:04] and when
[30:05] in that body
[30:08] free guarantee of resurrection
[30:13] god placed upon him the iniquity of us
[30:17] all
[30:18] not the one handshake not one church
[30:21] letter
[30:21] but by one holy spirit
[30:24] jew gentile yellow black white
[30:28] have all been baptized by one spirit
[30:31] into that one body to the blood of his
[30:34] own covenant and when i see the blood
[30:37] i'll pass
[30:38] over you and are free from death free
[30:41] from
[30:41] pain free from sin he that's born of god
[30:45] does not commit sin because the seed of
[30:47] god remains in him and he cannot sin
[30:50] praise the lord thank you no sin
[30:53] be therefore perfect even as your
[30:56] heavenly father is perfect jesus said
[30:58] how can you be perfect you can't do it
[31:00] she was born in sin
[31:01] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[31:03] speaking live
[31:05] but when you accept christ as your sin
[31:07] barrier
[31:08] when you accept him by faith you believe
[31:12] that he saved you
[31:13] and he died in your place and tough your
[31:16] sins
[31:17] then god accepts you and baptizes you
[31:20] into the body and cannot see no more sin
[31:25] how can i be a sinner when there's an
[31:27] atonement on the altar for me
[31:29] how could a policeman rest me in the
[31:31] city when the city ordinances give me
[31:33] rights to run
[31:34] any speed that i want to you cannot rest
[31:38] me
[31:39] if the mayor says reverend branham
[31:41] you're going on sick calls
[31:42] make any speech you want to it any zone
[31:45] gives me a letter of recommendation to
[31:47] that
[31:47] no policeman can take me in
[31:50] because the mayor has put confidence in
[31:53] me that i wouldn't do it less is on
[31:54] emergency
[31:55] and when god accepted me and baptized me
[31:58] at the holy ghost he had
[31:59] confidence in me that i would not sin
[32:01] willfully
[32:03] amen i would not sin wealthy
[32:07] therefore his son made an atonement for
[32:09] me and i
[32:10] cannot be a sinner as long as i'm
[32:12] justified and he's tucked me in his body
[32:14] i'm redeemed with him not what i do but
[32:17] what he did for me
[32:19] that's the last room hallelujah thank
[32:22] you jesus
[32:25] [Music]
[32:26] ephesians
