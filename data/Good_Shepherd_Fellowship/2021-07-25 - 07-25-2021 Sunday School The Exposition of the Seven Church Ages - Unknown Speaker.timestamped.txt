[4:13] but is full of the joy of the lord the
[4:16] christian ought to be just as exuberant
[4:18] and full of his pleasure in the lord
[4:20] as the world is when it savors and
[4:21] delights in its pleasures
[4:23] both christians and the world are human
[4:26] both have emotions
[4:27] the difference is the christians hearts
[4:29] and emotions are purely on the lord of
[4:31] glory and his love
[4:33] while the world satisfies the flesh
[4:36] now it says that john was in the spirit
[4:38] on the lord's day
[4:40] oh my here is a verse that really causes
[4:42] some dissension
[4:43] not that it needs to or ought to but
[4:46] some just don't see what the word really
[4:48] says
[4:49] first of all we find some fine folks
[4:51] that call the lord's day the sabbath day
[4:53] which to them is saturday then there are
[4:56] the others who call the lord's day
[4:58] sunday the first day of the week but how
[5:01] could it be either of these days
[5:03] or even the two put together for john
[5:05] was in the spirit receiving those
[5:06] visions for a period of two years
[5:09] actually what had happened was that john
[5:11] was caught up in the spirit and
[5:12] transported into the lord's day which is
[5:14] yet to come
[5:16] the bible speaks of the day of the lord
[5:18] which is to be in the future
[5:20] and john is now seeing the things of
[5:22] that future day
[5:23] but in the meantime just to settle our
[5:25] minds let us find out exactly what the
[5:27] sabbath is today
[5:30] the sabbath as we know it from the new
[5:32] testament is not the keeping of a
[5:33] certain day
[5:35] we have no command whatsoever to keep
[5:37] saturday for a sabbath
[5:38] nor do we have any commandment to keep
[5:40] the first day of the week which is
[5:42] sunday
[5:43] here is the truth of the sabbath which
[5:45] means rest
[5:46] hebrews 4 8 for if jesus had given them
[5:50] rest
[5:50] or rest day then would he not afterward
[5:53] have spoken of another day
[5:55] there remaineth therefore arrest sabbath
[5:58] keeping to the people of god
[6:00] for he that has entered into his rest he
[6:02] also have ceased from his own works as
[6:04] god did from his
[6:06] did you hear that key phrase in the last
[6:08] part of the verse
[6:10] god ceased from his own works god gave
[6:13] israel the seventh day for their sabbath
[6:15] in commemoration of his own work wherein
[6:17] he created the world and all that was
[6:19] therein
[6:20] and then stopped creating he ceased from
[6:23] his labors
[6:24] he rested now it was fine to give a
[6:27] sabbath rest
[6:28] to a people who were all in one place at
[6:30] one time so they could all keep a
[6:32] certain day
[6:33] today half the world is in light while
[6:35] the other half is in darkness so it
[6:37] wouldn't work at all
[6:38] but that is just an argument from the
[6:40] natural
[6:42] let's see what the bible teaches us
[6:43] about this sabbath rest
[6:45] for he that is entered into his rest
[6:48] this entering
[6:49] in is not only entering in but remaining
[6:51] in the rest
[6:52] it is an eternal rest of which the
[6:55] seventh day is but a type
[6:57] seven is completion eight is the first
[7:00] day again
[7:01] jesus resurrection was in the first day
[7:03] of the week giving us eternal life and
[7:05] eternal sabbath rest
[7:07] thus we see why god could not give us
[7:09] any one certain day of the week as a
[7:11] sabbath
[7:11] rest we've entered into and do
[7:15] remain in our rest which israel could
[7:17] not do
[7:18] having only a shadow of the true
[7:20] substance which we enjoy
[7:22] why go back to his shadow when we have
[7:23] reality now
[7:26] how we receive this rest or continuing
[7:28] sabbath is at the invitation of jesus
[7:31] he said in matthew 11 28-29
[7:35] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[7:37] heavy laden
[7:38] and i will give you rest take my yoke
[7:40] upon you and learn of me
[7:42] and ye shall find rest or keeping of the
[7:44] sabbath not a day but eternal life
[7:47] sabbath unto your souls
[7:50] no matter how long you have been
[7:51] laboring under your load of sin
[7:53] whether it is 10 years 30 years or 50
[7:55] years or longer
[7:57] come with your tired weary life and you
[7:58] will find his rest
[8:00] the true sabbath jesus will give you
[8:02] rest
[8:04] now exactly what is that rest that jesus
[8:06] will give
[8:07] isaiah 28 8-12 for all tables are full
[8:11] of vomit and filthiness
[8:13] so that there is no place clean whom
[8:15] shall he teach knowledge
[8:17] and whom shall he make to understand
[8:19] doctrine
[8:20] them that are weaned from the milk and
[8:21] drawn from the breasts
[8:23] for precept must be upon precept precept
[8:26] upon precept
[8:27] line upon line line upon line here a
[8:30] little and there a little
[8:31] for with stammering lips and another
[8:33] tongue will he speak to this people
[8:35] to whom he said this is the rest sabbath
[8:38] wherewith he may cause the weary to rest
[8:41] or keeping of his sabbath
[8:42] and this is the refreshing yet they
[8:45] would not hear
[8:46] here it is prophesied right here in
[8:48] isaiah and it came to pass about 700
[8:51] years later at pentecost
[8:53] when they were all filled with the holy
[8:54] ghost exactly as it was said they would
[8:56] be
[8:57] this is the true sabbath that was
[8:59] promised thus when they were filled with
[9:01] the holy ghost
[9:02] they ceased from their worldly works
[9:04] their worldly doings their evil ways
[9:06] the holy ghost took charge of their
[9:08] lives they entered into rest
[9:11] there is your rest that is your sabbath
[9:14] it is not a day nor a year but the
[9:16] eternity of being filled and blessed in
[9:18] the holy spirit
[9:19] it is you ceasing and god doing it is
[9:22] god in you willing and doing of his good
[9:24] pleasure
[9:26] let me make one more note about the
[9:27] saturdayarians who claim that we meet on
[9:29] the wrong day of the week when we meet
[9:31] on sunday the first day
[9:33] here is what justin said in the second
[9:35] century
[9:36] on sunday a meeting is held of all who
[9:38] live in cities and villages
[9:40] and a section is read of the memoirs of
[9:42] the apostles and the writings as long as
[9:44] time permits
[9:45] when the reading is finished the
[9:47] president in a discourse gives the
[9:48] admonition and exhortation
[9:50] to imitate those noble things after this
[9:52] we all arise to offer common prayer
[9:55] at the close of the prayer as we have
[9:57] described bread and wine are placed
[9:59] before us and thanksgiving made and the
[10:01] congregation answers
[10:02] amen then the elements are distributed
[10:05] to each one
[10:06] and are partaken of and carried by the
[10:08] deacons to the house of the absent
[10:10] the wealthy and willing then give
[10:12] contributions according to their free
[10:13] will
[10:14] and this collection is deposited with
[10:16] the president who there with supplies
[10:18] orphans
[10:19] widows prisoners strangers in want
[10:22] thus we see that those who claim the
[10:24] early church carried on the judaic
[10:26] tradition of assembling on the last day
[10:27] of the week
[10:28] are grossly ignorant of what history
[10:30] actually sets forth
[10:31] and are therefore not worthy of
[10:33] confidence
[10:35] oh that people might come unto him and
[10:36] find that rest
[10:38] there is a cry in all hearts for that
[10:40] rest but the majority don't know the
[10:42] answer
[10:43] so they try to steal the cry by a
[10:45] religious process of keeping certain
[10:47] days
[10:47] or accepting denominational creeds and
[10:49] dogmas
[10:51] but failing in that many try drinking
[10:53] carousing and every physical excess
[10:56] thinking that by worldly pleasures there
[10:58] can be some satisfaction
[11:00] but in such there is no rest they smoke
[11:03] and take pills to quiet their nerves
[11:05] but there is no rest in earthly potions
[11:08] they need jesus
[11:09] they need the heavenly remedy the rest
[11:11] of the spirit
[11:14] then the most of them go to church on
[11:16] sunday
[11:17] that is good but even there they have no
[11:19] idea of how to approach god and how to
[11:21] worship him
[11:22] jesus said that true worship was in
[11:24] spirit and in truth
[11:25] john 4 24. but what kind of worship can
[11:29] you get in a church that knows so
[11:31] little of god it puts up a santa claus
[11:33] at christmas and bunnies at easter
[11:35] where did they get that they got it from
[11:38] the pagans and made it a part of the
[11:39] church doctrine
[11:41] but when one turns to the lord and is
[11:42] filled with the holy ghost
[11:44] he ceases from all such things he has a
[11:46] rest in his soul
[11:48] he really begins to live and love god
[11:50] and worship him
[11:52] now let's get back to our scripture we
[11:55] know what the lord's day is not
[11:57] if it is not saturday or sunday what is
[11:59] it well let's put it this way
[12:02] today is certainly not the lord's day
[12:05] this is man's day it is man's doing
[12:08] man's work
[12:09] man's church man's idea of worship man's
[12:12] everything
[12:13] for it is man's world cosmos
[12:17] but the day of the lord is coming yes it
[12:19] is
[12:20] it is just that at this time of the
[12:22] revelation of jesus christ john was
[12:24] taken up by the spirit and transported
[12:26] by the spirit to that great day that is
[12:28] coming
[12:29] the lord's day is when the days of man
[12:31] are over
[12:32] the kingdoms of this world will then
[12:34] become the kingdoms of our god
[12:36] the day of the lord is when the
[12:37] judgments fall and after that comes the
[12:39] millennium
[12:41] right now the world does what it wants
[12:43] to do with the christian
[12:44] they call him all manner of evil names
[12:46] making fun of him
[12:48] but there is coming that great and
[12:49] notable day when they will wail and
[12:52] howl for the lamb is coming in wrath to
[12:54] judge the world
[12:55] that is when the righteous will have
[12:57] their day with the lord
[12:58] for the wicked shall burn and the
[13:00] righteous will walk over their ashes
[13:01] into the millennium
[13:03] malachi 4 3. and you shall tread down
[13:07] the wicked for they shall be ashes unto
[13:08] the soles of your feet
[13:10] in the day that i shall do this saith
[13:12] the lord of hosts
[13:14] the voice like a trumpet revelation
[13:18] 1 and heard behind me a great voice as
[13:21] of a trumpet
[13:23] john was in the spirit and when he was
[13:25] he saw the great and wonderful day of
[13:27] the lord jesus and all his holy power
[13:29] the future was about to unfold for god
[13:32] was about to teach him john did not say
[13:34] it was a trumpet
[13:36] it was like a trumpet now when a trumpet
[13:38] is blown it has an
[13:39] urgency about it it is like the herald
[13:42] the king's messenger coming to the
[13:43] people
[13:44] he blows on a trumpet it is an urgent
[13:46] call the people
[13:48] gather to listen israel was always
[13:50] assembled by the sounding of a trumpet
[13:52] something important is at hand listen to
[13:55] it
[13:56] so this voice had the same urgency of
[13:58] appeal as did the trumpet
[14:00] clear and strong it was startling and
[14:02] awakening
[14:03] oh that we might hear the voice of god
[14:05] as a trumpet this day
[14:07] for it is the gospel trumpet sounding
[14:09] forth the word of prophecy
[14:11] to make us aware of and prepared for
[14:13] what is coming upon the earth
[14:16] the command to write revelation
[14:20] 1 11 saying i am alpha and omega the
[14:24] first
[14:24] and the last and what thou seest write
[14:27] in a book
[14:28] and send it unto the seven churches
[14:29] which are in asia onto ephesus
[14:32] and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and
[14:35] unto thyatira
[14:36] and unto sardis and on to philadelphia
[14:39] and unto laodicea
[14:41] here it is the first and last the alpha
[14:44] and omega
[14:45] that's all of it the one true god
[14:48] the voice and word of god reality and
[14:51] truth is at hand
[14:53] what a thing it is to be in the spirit
[14:55] my to be in the presence of god and hear
[14:58] from him what thou seest write in a book
[15:01] and send it to the seven churches
[15:03] the voice that sounded forth his word in
[15:05] the garden of eden and upon mount sinai
[15:08] which voice was also heard in the
[15:10] excellent glory of the mount of
[15:11] transfiguration
[15:12] was once again sounding forth and this
[15:15] time to the seven churches with the
[15:17] complete and final revelation of jesus
[15:19] christ
[15:20] write the visions john make a record of
[15:23] them for the ages which are to follow
[15:25] for they are the true prophecies which
[15:27] must come to pass
[15:29] write them and send them out making them
[15:31] known
[15:33] john recognized that voice oh you will
[15:36] recognize that voice when he calls if
[15:37] you are one of his own
[15:40] the golden lamp stands revelation
[15:44] 1 12 and i turned to see the voice that
[15:47] spake with me
[15:48] and being turned i saw seven golden
[15:50] candle sticks
[15:52] john does not say that he turned to see
[15:54] the one whose voice he heard
[15:55] but he turned to see the voice oh i like
[15:58] that
[15:59] he turned to see the voice the voice and
[16:02] the person are one and the same
[16:04] jesus is the word john 1
[16:07] 1-3 in the beginning was the word and
[16:11] the word was with god
[16:12] and the word was god the same was in the
[16:15] beginning with god
[16:17] all things were made by him and without
[16:19] him was not anything made that was
[16:22] made if you can ever get to really see
[16:25] the word you will be seeing
[16:26] jesus when john turned he saw seven
[16:29] golden candlesticks
[16:31] actually there were lamp stands and
[16:33] according to verse 20 they are the seven
[16:35] churches the seven candlesticks that
[16:38] thou sawest are the seven churches
[16:41] to represent the churches they could
[16:42] hardly be candles
[16:44] a candle burns but a while and then is
[16:46] burned out it dies
[16:48] there would be no more to it but lamp
[16:50] stands possess a lasting quality not
[16:52] found in candles
[16:54] if you want to get a beautiful picture
[16:56] of the lamp read about it in zechariah 4
[16:58] 1-6 and the angel that talked with me
[17:01] came again and waked me
[17:03] as a man that awakened out of his sleep
[17:06] and said unto me
[17:07] what see is thou and i said i have
[17:10] looked and behold a candlestick all of
[17:12] gold
[17:13] with a bowl upon the top of it and his
[17:15] seven lamps thereon
[17:16] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[17:19] are upon the top thereof
[17:21] and two olive trees by it one upon the
[17:23] right side of the bowl and the other
[17:25] upon the left side thereof
[17:27] so i answered and spake to the angel
[17:29] that talked with me saying
[17:30] what are these my lord then the angel
[17:33] that talked with me answered and said
[17:35] unto me
[17:36] know us down not what these be and i
[17:39] said no my lord
[17:40] then he answered and spake unto me
[17:42] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[17:44] zerubbabel
[17:45] saying not by might nor by power but by
[17:48] my spirit
[17:49] saith the lord of hosts here is another
[17:53] lamp of pure gold
[17:54] it is burning brightly because it has
[17:56] plenty of oil which it is getting from
[17:58] the two olive trees
[17:59] which stand on either side the two trees
[18:02] represent the old and new testament and
[18:04] of course
[18:05] the oil typifies the holy ghost who
[18:07] alone can give the light of god to the
[18:09] people
[18:10] the angel who spoke to zechariah was as
[18:12] much as saying
[18:14] this what you see means that the church
[18:16] cannot accomplish anything by its own
[18:18] might or power
[18:19] but by the holy ghost now examine this
[18:23] lamp stand
[18:24] you will notice that it has a large bowl
[18:26] or reservoir
[18:27] that is central to seven arms that come
[18:29] out of it this bowl is filled with olive
[18:31] oil which flows through seven wicks
[18:33] which are placed in the seven arms
[18:35] it is the same oil that burns and makes
[18:37] a light at the end of the seven pipes
[18:40] this light never went out the priests
[18:42] just kept pouring oil into the bowl
[18:45] the lamp was lit in a special way first
[18:48] the priest took fire from the sacred
[18:50] altar which was originally lighted by
[18:52] the fire of god
[18:53] he lit first of all the lamp that was
[18:55] sitting on top of the bowl
[18:57] he then lit the second lamp from the
[18:59] flame of the first lamp
[19:00] the third lamp received its fire from
[19:02] the second lamp as did the fourth
[19:04] receive its from the third and so on
[19:07] until all the seven lamps were burning
[19:09] this holy fire from the altar being
[19:11] passed from lamp to lamp
[19:13] is a wonderful type of the holy spirit
[19:15] in the seven church ages
[19:17] the original outpouring of pentecost
[19:19] which outpouring came direct from jesus
[19:21] on the mercy seat
[19:22] is enduing his church through all the
[19:24] seven ages
[19:26] and showing forth perfectly that jesus
[19:28] christ is the same yesterday
[19:30] and today and forever the never changing
[19:32] god in his essence and his ways
[19:36] in john 15 jesus said i am the vine ye
[19:40] are the branches
[19:41] he is the main vine that which comes out
[19:43] of the original root from the original
[19:45] seed that has the life in it
[19:48] now the vine does not bear fruit it is
[19:50] the branches that do that
[19:52] now watch this you can take a citrus
[19:54] tree such as an orange tree
[19:56] and graft into it a grapefruit limb a
[19:59] lemon limb a tangelo limb
[20:01] and other kinds of that variety and all
[20:03] those limbs will grow
[20:05] but those grafted limbs will not bear
[20:07] oranges no sir
[20:09] the lemon limb will bear lemons and the
[20:11] grapefruit limb will bear grapefruit and
[20:13] so on
[20:14] yet those limbs will be thriving off the
[20:16] life in the tree
[20:17] but if that tree ever puts forth another
[20:19] branch of itself
[20:20] it will be an orange branch and bare
[20:22] oranges why
[20:24] because the life in the limb and the
[20:26] life in the trunk are identical whereas
[20:28] it wasn't so with the grafted limbs
[20:30] those grafted branches had their sources
[20:32] in other kinds of life from other trees
[20:35] from other roots from other seeds oh
[20:37] they will bear fruit all right but they
[20:39] won't bear oranges
[20:40] they cannot because they are not the
[20:42] original
[20:44] that's the way the church is the vine
[20:46] has been split and limbs have been
[20:48] grafted in
[20:49] they have grafted in baptist limbs
[20:51] methodist limbs presbyterian limbs and
[20:53] pentecostal limbs
[20:55] and those limbs are bearing baptist
[20:56] methodist pentecostal and presbyterian
[20:59] fruit
[21:00] denominational seeds from which they
[21:02] produce their fruit
[21:04] but if the vine ever brings forth
[21:05] another branch of itself
[21:07] that branch will be exactly like the
[21:09] vine itself
[21:10] it will be the same kind of a branch
[21:12] that was brought forth at pentecost
[21:14] it will speak in tongues prophesy and
[21:17] have the power and signs of the
[21:18] resurrected jesus christ in it
[21:20] why because it's thriving on the natural
[21:23] resources of the vine itself
[21:25] you see it wasn't grafted into the vine
[21:28] it was born
[21:28] in the vine when those other branches
[21:31] were grafted in all they could do was
[21:33] bear their own fruit
[21:34] for they were not born of that vine they
[21:36] don't know about that original life and
[21:38] original fruit
[21:40] they cannot know for they were not born
[21:42] of it but if they had been born of it
[21:44] that same life that was in the original
[21:46] stem jesus
[21:48] would have come through them and
[21:49] manifested through them
[21:51] john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you
[21:56] he that believeth on me the works that i
[21:58] do shall he do
[21:59] also and greater works than these shall
[22:02] he do
[22:03] because i go unto my father
[22:06] denominations which are man directed
[22:09] cannot be born of god
[22:10] for it is the spirit not man that gives
[22:13] life
[22:15] how thrilling it is to think of those
[22:16] seven lamps drawing life and light from
[22:18] the resources of that main bowl
[22:20] because they had their wicks dipped
[22:21] therein each church age messenger is
[22:24] depicted here his life is on fire with
[22:27] the holy ghost
[22:28] his wick life has been immersed in
[22:31] christ
[22:32] through that wick he is drawing the very
[22:33] life of christ
[22:35] and by it gives out light to the church
[22:37] what kind of a light is he giving
[22:39] the very same light that was in the
[22:41] first lamp that was lit
[22:42] and right on down the ages to the
[22:44] present time of the last day messenger
[22:47] the same life and the same light is
[22:49] manifested by a life that is hid with
[22:51] christ in god
[22:54] not only can we speak thus of the
[22:55] messengers but every true believer is
[22:57] dramatically depicted here
[22:59] they are all drawing from the same
[23:00] source they have all been dipped into
[23:03] the same bowl
[23:04] they are dead to themselves and their
[23:06] lives are hid with christ in god
[23:08] they are sealed in by the holy ghost
[23:11] ephesians 4
[23:12] 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[23:16] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[23:18] redemption
[23:19] no man can pluck them out of his hand
[23:21] their lives cannot be tampered with
[23:23] the visible life is burning and shining
[23:26] giving light and manifestations of the
[23:28] holy ghost
[23:29] the inner invisible life is hidden in
[23:32] god and fed by the lord's word
[23:34] satan cannot touch them not even death
[23:37] can touch them
[23:38] for death has lost its sting the grave
[23:40] has lost its victory
[23:42] thanks be unto god they have this
[23:44] victory in and through the lord jesus
[23:46] christ
[23:47] amen and amen
[23:51] no longer the priest revelation 1
[23:55] 13 and in the midst of the seven
[23:57] candlesticks
[23:59] one like unto the son of man clothed
[24:01] with a garment down to the foot
[24:03] and gert about the paps with a golden
[24:04] girdle
[24:06] there he stands one like unto the son of
[24:08] man
[24:09] as the jewel is beautified by the
[24:11] mounting of the ring so he is glorified
[24:13] in the midst of the churches
[24:15] it is the lord's day for john sees him
[24:17] standing not as a priest but as the
[24:19] coming judge
[24:20] the golden girdle is no longer girt
[24:22] around the waist where the priest must
[24:24] wear it as he ministers to god in the
[24:25] holiest place
[24:27] but it is now around his shoulders for
[24:29] he is not now the priest but the judge
[24:33] now has john 5 22 come to pass
[24:36] for the father judgeth no man but have
[24:38] committed all judgment unto the son
[24:40] his service has been rendered the
[24:42] priesthood is over
[24:44] the days of the prophecy are finished he
[24:46] stands girded as the judge
[24:50] the seven-fold glory of his person
[24:54] revelation 1 14-16
[24:57] his head and his hairs were white like
[24:59] wool as white as snow
[25:01] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[25:03] his feet like unto fine brass
[25:05] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[25:08] voice as the sound of many waters
[25:10] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[25:13] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[25:14] two-edged sword
[25:15] and his countenance was as the sun
[25:17] shineth in his strength
[25:20] how deeply moving and inspiring was the
[25:22] appearing of jesus to john
[25:24] who was in exile for the cause of the
[25:26] word and behold the living word now
[25:28] stands before him
[25:30] what an illuminating vision for every
[25:32] descriptive attribute has a significance
[25:34] what a revelation of his glorious being
[25:38] one his hair as white as snow john first
[25:42] notices and mentions the whiteness of
[25:44] his hair
[25:45] it was white and as bright as snow this
[25:48] was not because of his age
[25:49] oh no the brilliantly white hair does
[25:52] not signify age but experience maturity
[25:54] and wisdom
[25:56] the eternal one does not age what is
[25:58] time to god
[26:00] time means little to god but wisdom
[26:02] means much
[26:03] it is as when solomon called to god for
[26:05] wisdom to judge the people of israel
[26:08] now he is coming the judge of all the
[26:09] earth he will be crowned with wisdom
[26:12] that is what the white and glistening
[26:13] hair signifies
[26:15] see this in daniel 7 9-14
[26:19] i beheld till the thrones were cast down
[26:21] and the ancient of days did sit
[26:23] whose garment was white as snow and the
[26:25] hair of his head like the pure wool
[26:28] his throne was like the fiery flame and
[26:30] his wheels as burning fire
[26:32] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[26:34] from before him
[26:36] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[26:38] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[26:40] stood before him
[26:42] the judgment was set and the books were
[26:44] opened
[26:45] i beheld then because of the voice of
[26:47] the great words which the horn spake
[26:49] i beheld even till the beast was slain
[26:52] and his body destroyed and given to the
[26:54] burning flame
[26:55] as concerning the rest of the beasts
[26:58] they had their dominion taken away
[27:00] yet their lives were prolonged for a
[27:02] season and time
[27:03] i saw in the night visions and behold
[27:06] one like the son of man
[27:07] came with the clouds of heaven and came
[27:10] to the ancient of days
[27:11] and they brought him near before him and
[27:14] there was given him dominion and glory
[27:16] and a kingdom
[27:17] that all people nations and languages
[27:19] should serve him
[27:20] his dominion is in everlasting dominion
[27:23] which shall not pass away
[27:25] and his kingdom that which shall not be
[27:26] destroyed
[27:28] there it is daniel saw him with that
[27:30] white hair
[27:31] he was the judge opening the books and
[27:33] judging out of them
[27:35] daniel saw him coming in clouds that is
[27:38] exactly what john saw
[27:40] they both saw him exactly the same they
[27:43] saw the judge
[27:43] with his judgment girdle over his
[27:45] shoulders standing pure and holy full of
[27:48] wisdom
[27:48] fully qualified to judge the world in
[27:50] righteousness hallelujah
[27:53] even the world understands this
[27:55] symbology for in ancient times the judge
[27:57] would appear and convene court
[27:59] dressed in a white wig and a long robe
[28:01] that signified his complete authority
[28:03] head-to-foot robe to meet out justice
[28:07] two his eyes as fire
[28:10] think of it those eyes that were once
[28:12] dimmed with tears of sorrow and pity
[28:15] those eyes that wept with compassion at
[28:17] the grave of lazarus
[28:18] those eyes that saw not the evil of the
[28:20] murderers who hanged him on a cross
[28:22] but in sorrow cried father forgive them
[28:26] now those eyes are a flame of fire the
[28:28] eyes of the judge who will recompense
[28:30] those who rejected him
[28:33] of all the human emotions he manifested
[28:35] the most when he appeared as the son of
[28:36] man
[28:37] was this one he wept often yet behind
[28:40] that weeping and that sorrow there was
[28:42] still
[28:42] god those same eyes saw visions
[28:46] they looked deep within the hearts of
[28:47] men and read their very thoughts
[28:49] and knew all their various ways blazing
[28:52] out of mortal eyes was god who cried to
[28:54] those who knew him not for what he was
[28:58] if ye believe not that i am he ye shall
[29:00] die in your sins
[29:03] john 8 24 if i do not the works of my
[29:07] father believe me not
[29:08] but if i do the works of my father
[29:10] though ye believe not me believe the
[29:13] works
[29:14] john 10 37-38
[29:17] like jeremiah of old he was the weeping
[29:19] prophet
[29:20] for men received not the word of god and
[29:22] thrust aside the revelation
[29:25] those fiery flaming eyes of the judge
[29:27] are even now recording the lives of all
[29:30] flesh
[29:31] running to and fro throughout the earth
[29:32] there is nothing he does not know
[29:35] he knows the desires of the heart and
[29:37] what each one intends to do
[29:39] there is nothing hidden that shall not
[29:40] be revealed for all things are naked
[29:43] before him with whom we have to do
[29:45] think of it he knows even now what you
[29:48] are thinking
[29:49] yes there he stands as judge with
[29:52] flaming eyes to meet out judgment
[29:54] the day of mercy is over oh that men
[29:57] might repent and seek his face in
[29:58] righteousness while there is yet time
[30:01] that they might make his bosom their
[30:02] pillow air the world dissolves in fire
[30:06] three the feet of brass
[30:10] and his feet like unto fine brass as if
[30:12] they burned in a furnace
[30:14] brass is noted for its remarkable
[30:16] hardness there is nothing that is known
[30:18] that you can put with it to temper it
[30:21] but this brass that describes his feet
[30:23] is more remarkable yet
[30:24] in that it has stood the test of the
[30:26] fiery furnace
[30:27] a test that no other one has gone
[30:29] through and that is exactly right
[30:32] for brass signifies divine judgment a
[30:35] judgment that god decreed and brought to
[30:37] pass
[30:38] john 3 14-19 and as moses lifted up the
[30:42] serpent in the wilderness
[30:44] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[30:46] that whosoever believeth in him should
[30:49] not perish
[30:50] but have eternal life for god so loved
[30:52] the world
[30:53] that he gave his only begotten son that
[30:56] whosoever believeth in him should not
[30:58] perish but have everlasting life
[31:01] for god sent not his son into the world
[31:03] to condemn the world
[31:04] but that the world through him might be
[31:06] saved
[31:07] he that believeth on him is not
[31:09] condemned but he that believeth not
[31:12] is condemned already because he hath not
[31:14] believed in the name of the only
[31:16] begotten son of god
[31:18] and this is the condemnation that light
[31:20] has come into the world
[31:22] and men loved darkness rather than light
[31:24] because their deeds were evil
[31:27] numbers 21 8-9
[31:30] and the lord said unto moses make me a
[31:32] fiery serpent and set it upon a pole
[31:35] and it shall come to pass that everyone
[31:37] that is bitten when he looketh upon it
[31:39] shall live and moses made a serpent of
[31:42] brass and put it upon a pole
[31:45] and it came to pass that if a serpent
[31:46] had bitten any man when he beheld the
[31:48] serpent of brass
[31:49] he lived israel had sinned
[31:53] sin had to be judged so god commanded
[31:56] moses to place a brazen serpent on a
[31:58] pole
[31:58] and he who looked was saved from the
[32:00] penalty of his sin
[32:03] the brazen serpent on the pole
[32:05] symbolized sin from the garden of eden
[32:07] where the serpent beguiled eve causing
[32:10] her to sin
[32:11] brass speaks of judgment as is seen in
[32:13] the brazen altar where the penalty for
[32:15] sin was met in the sacrifice upon the
[32:17] altar
[32:18] when god judged israel for her sins in
[32:20] the days of elijah
[32:22] he withheld the rain and the fiery
[32:23] heavens became as brass
[32:25] now in this illustration we see that the
[32:27] serpent upon the pole represents sin
[32:30] already judged for it is made of brass
[32:32] showing divine judgment had already
[32:34] fallen upon sin
[32:36] then whoever looked at the serpent on
[32:38] the pole accepting the significance of
[32:40] it was made whole
[32:41] for this was the work or salvation of
[32:43] the lord
[32:45] the serpent on the pole is a type of
[32:47] what jesus came into the earth to
[32:49] accomplish
[32:50] he was made flesh in order to take upon
[32:53] himself the judgments of god for sin
[32:55] the foundation of the altar of sacrifice
[32:57] was solid brass
[32:59] typifying the lamb slain from before the
[33:01] foundation of the world
[33:03] judgment had already passed upon him
[33:05] when as yet there were no sinners
[33:07] salvation being entirely of the lord he
[33:10] trod the winepress of the fierceness of
[33:12] the wrath of god alone
[33:14] his vestures were dyed crimson with his
[33:16] own blood
[33:17] the fiery furnace of the just judgment
[33:19] and wrath of god was his portion
[33:22] he suffered the just for the unjust
[33:25] thou art worthy o lamb of god for thou
[33:27] hast redeemed us by thine own blood
[33:30] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[33:32] was bruised for our iniquity
[33:34] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[33:36] him and by his
[33:38] stripes we are healed the lord hath laid
[33:40] upon him the iniquity of us
[33:42] all he suffered as no man had ever
[33:45] suffered
[33:46] even before the cross he had shed great
[33:48] drops of sweat like blood from his body
[33:50] as in the intense agony of the ordeal
[33:52] ahead the very blood separated in his
[33:55] veins
[33:56] luke 22 44 and being in
[34:00] agony he prayed more earnestly and his
[34:02] sweat was as it were great drops of
[34:04] blood falling down to the ground
[34:07] but someday those feet of brass will
[34:09] stand upon the earth
[34:11] and the judge of all the earth he shall
[34:13] be and with equity
[34:24] [Music]

[36:29] you
