there and just just like it always been just just you know we just miss talking thank you I want to hold you much longer this tonight I've been watching live streaming some of your services and I know some of y'all are used to staying in church three hours and so and that's real comfortable Amen brother Joshua Goff is live streaming and really Joss they've got a real nice uh headset here that I want you to look into for me it comes across the back of the neck and amen look real good so I know he's live streaming and he's the technician there so he helps with that amen so it was good to see brother Jordan all over the place again tonight working on wires amen it reminds my church that we're not the only one that does stuff like that once the service gets started right amen so it's real good let's turn quickly now into the book of First Corinthians chapter 10. amen we're going to speak tonight on the journey toward rapturing faith and uh I just recently spent uh about 25 hours preaching this to my church not 25 hours straight you understand it was 25 hours divided into a number of services preaching this topic only there at home I had a different subject with it was called the I am series but some of my folks that are watching tonight uh they'll they'll understand that I have condensed this and I don't have 25 hours to spend here and with you folks at Good Shepherd so I'm going to try to condense some of these thoughts tonight if I can get by with it but in First Corinthians chapter 10 beginning in verse 1 and reading through verse 11. amen the word of God says moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant which is simply means unlearned how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and we're all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them not with all but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and to drink and Rose up to play verse 8 neither let us commit excuse me amen I have two of these uh tablets one of them turned into Chinese while I was waiting to come in here and so I've learned to bring two and this one here goes a little bit faster than I'm uh able to do amen so verse 8 again neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happen unto them for in samples and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come I think they're written for us right amen so as you're seated I ask that you asked the Lord to add a blessing to the reading of the word of God tonight you may take your seats amen so what we're looking at tonight is a comparison of The Exodus as it would apply to rapturing Faith or to the rapturing message and tonight as we go through this and I offered brother uh one opportunity for him or some other preacher to take some of these Services because I didn't come just to be heard I come to amen here myself so on these events all of these events that happened in this Exodus Journey according to the text that I just read we can find a type of our journey toward rapturing Faith that's for the church General that's for the entire body but we can also find examples for our individual walks with Walk With Jesus Christ amen now I know that everybody in here would hopes to take the body change right everybody in here is looking for rapturing Faith so amen we got this these examples in the Bible of what we should do and what we should not do especially those of us who live at the end time now all of us believe I believe that most of us in here would say certainly amen with all the events that we see today we must be near the end of our journey the rapturing faith must be very close the body change amen should be up on us very quickly so our journey toward rapturing faith and the messages for our individual walk is contained in these things that we're going to be looking at this is not a deep Revelation I'm not going to be bringing you any deep Revelations tonight or tomorrow amen I'm just going to try to share with you amen how you can be assured that you are hearing a rapturing faith messages amen and it will come by Revelation right I believe that's what brother Brown said the Rapture is a revelation and the bride will be waiting for that Revelation amen now they he didn't say this is it he said they will be waiting for that Revelation when he preached the Rapture message he didn't say this is that he said they will or she will be waiting for that revelation of rapturing Faith amen so I think that we should be able to see God doing things among the bride in this hour I think that we ought to keep our eyes open our ears Amen in tune we with the word of God and with the happenings around us as we look at the events of our journey toward rapturing Faith amen remember what he said in First Corinthians 10 6. now these things were our examples right amen so that God's going to lay this out and it'll be so plain that a man like myself a wayfaring fool can understand amen what God is doing in this hour and I really want to understand what God is doing and I know that God sent you a pastor amen that will help you have have faith in the word of God so that when the time comes for God to do something Supernatural you're ready for it to happen amen so studying The Exodus Journey you can follow the trail of their trials now there were many trials in this Exodus Journey but there were many blessings also there were many mountaintops there were many valleys there were many things that took place that they cause to happen them on cells amen and there was always invitations from God Amen for for a way out of the situation that they had gotten themselves into and so as we look at this we understand the Bible said amen for us not to lust after they lusted after evil things now naturally when we talk about this word lust certain things come to mind amen but it's not going to be entirely like as the word conveys us of what this lust is some of the things that they lusted after were some of the same things that you might find in your life you might find that in yourself that you're looking at things in a way that amen will hinder your walk with God and listen to me church we don't want no hindrance right an old sister that recently passed away she said I don't want nothing here Amen to hinder me when she sang a song I don't want anything here to hinder me well I don't either so amen let me look at these examples in the Bible so that I can shed all the things that are hindering me amen and come to this rapturing face now all these things happened amen for ex and samples in samples the Bible said and they are written for our admonition upon whom the world the ends of the world have come amen so we go in now we begin the journey everybody knows when The Exodus Journey began amen it did not begin with Moses it did not begin with amen the burning bush it did not begin uh uh with the slavery it began in Genesis 15 verse 13. amen when God is dealing with Abraham and God is bringing Abel at the time Genesis 15 it's Abram but just let me call him Abraham God is speaking to Abraham about what's going to happen in the future and he tells Abraham he says I want you to know for a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years amen that's actually the beginning of the Rapture because God has spoken it and when God speaks it expect it you say praise the Lord for that when God speaks at church expect it now amen God has spoken to us also right he's spoken to us in math uh uh First Corinthians I believe chapter 15 amen there will be a body change right in the moment and then the twinkling of an eye that's God's business right amen now somebody might think that the Rapture is going to take place in the moment in twinkling eye but that's far from the truth amen because the Rapture has already started it's a process of events amen but the body change will come in the moment in the twinkling of an hour at the last Trump right amen I don't know that it's president Trump but I I know the amen there is a trumpeting sound that's going to cause us to have a body change right amen so we begin to look at these things and the prophecy has been spoken there will be a body change in the moment and in the twinkling of an eye can you say praise the Lord amen and because we know that that prophecy must come to pass because it's just like genesis 15 and 13. amen your children will be in Egypt for 400 years now they were not slaves for 400 years amen they only became slaves after Joseph passed away right amen uh that that's just a little bit of extra it don't mean it cost you anything to get that little tidbit amen amen but nevertheless we look at this amen there will be a Rapture can you say praise the Lord amen so if there is going to be a rapture we know that we ought to be prepared for it amen so at the time for the prophecy to be fulfilled we begin to see God begin to set things in motion is that right amen he began to get things ready now this will if this Rapture comes upon you amen and you are ignorant of it that is going to be your fault right amen because God is in a five-fold Ministry to take these things that brother random gave us and make them so plain before us that we will be able we should be able just to walk by faith amen into this thing that we are so diligently looking for in this hour so when God began to things to begin to set things in motion for the prophecy to be fulfilled amen I'm sure everybody is familiar with this God heard something going on in Egypt are you with me amen he heard something going on in Egypt I don't know how long these children cried I don't know how long these children of Abrahams cried I don't know how long they were slaves but amen they absolutely began to cry out something that was in their heart right I mean what was it they began to cry out let us go into the Wilderness and let us worship our Lord right that was something that God placed in their heart it wasn't something that Pharaoh had taught them it wasn't something that Moses had taught them because he had been gone for 40 years remember when they began to cry out through pre-depth predestination let us go and worship Our God oh my amen you understand God hears amen the slightest Cry of your heart Amen to get right with him God hears amen the The faintest Whisper that comes from your soul amen that wants you to get closer to him that seed that God has placed in You by predestination amen when it begins to cry out amen for a connection with the Holy Spirit when you begin to hunger and thirst after righteousness when you begin to Long more for God Amen than you do for the things of this world Amen God is hearing those things amen God Amen wants to move in your midst God wants to move in your soul amen So It Begins the children of Israel begin amen crying out in their heart let us go and let us Worship the Lord amen and God begins now to set things get the things in order we find what happens because there's a seed a life in these people crying out amen for the Rapture The Exodus it's CR they're crying out for it let this thing come to pass there there is amen a desire in us to be close to God to worship this God even though we don't know anything about him amen there's something inside of us that's crying let us go let us get out of this situation that we're in if you're comfortable in this world Amen something's wrong you say Amen if you're pleased with this world something is wrong if you've got amen more of a desire to be at a ball game tonight then you have to be in church something is wrong not with amen the message but something is wrong amen with your experience in God as we get move into amen rapturing mode Church there ought to be something stirring in our soul amen I want this more than life itself amen so things begin to get set in motion until we find that God calls his Prophet messenger Moses on the side of a mountain amen one day with a bush that was seemed to be on fire but it would not burn think about it amen we realize that is Mount Sinai right amen I want to take you to a message entitled the attraction on the mountain 1965 on July the 25th brother Branham is talking and it's near the end of the service and he says that he's talking about salvation was the attraction on Mount Calvary what is the attraction on Mount Calvary salvation but then notice what brother Branham says after he makes that statement he said the same attraction on Sunset Mountain Nebo Mount Sinai all the different Mountain Top experiences now I'm going to slow down some Amen to try to bring forth the thought that I really have on my heart amen if you really want to look for God and what God has done and what God is doing to get us ready for the Rapture amen take this quote from Brother Branham that if there was a Mount Sinai experience to get the people ready for Rapture Faith then brother random said the same attraction on Sunset Mountain same thing on Sunset Mountain that happened Mount Nebo Mount Sinai all these different Mountain Top experiences right amen so when we look around us we ask ourselves is there anything Amen in comparison in the message of this hour that can we can relate amen sunset Mountain and say Mount Sinai can you say amen amen amen now you understand that there's more than one experience in the Bible at Mount Sinai amen one is the experience where God is getting Moses ready please amen and begins to talk to Moses he's got to form Moses's mind he's got to take Moses amen and transform his mind to where Moses is the man that will go down and do the job do you say Amen Moses will be the man Moses even says I can't do it Moses tells God you've got the wrong man you've made a mistake I I can't do this [Music] I'm getting ahead of myself amen but it's Mount Sinai and when I get into this and they return to Mount Sinai amen after they cross the Red Sea then they return to Mount Sinai hey but we can find the same thing in this message that happened at Mount Sinai amen only it happened on Sunset Mountain for us what was it church amen it was God coming down in a pillar of fire communicating amen with his people giving them the directions that they were to follow as they journeyed on towards the Promised Land thank God we've got the directions from a prophet that went to Mount Sinai amen he got the revelation of the Seven Seals and brought them back to the bride and we know how to live by faith we know what's going on around us so the same attraction on Sunset Mountain Mount Nebo Mount Sinai all those different Mountaintop experiences each step of the way we find Vindication of the message of the hour you understand that amen everywhere that God LED these children of Israel these Hebrews is the same thing that we can look for in the message of the hour in other words I know where I'm at by examples I know what God is doing by examples God has not left us ignorant brothers and sisters amen he's made the way very plain for us to follow each step of the way we find Vindication of a message amen like seeing what is uh happening at Mount Sinai amen we see spiritually happening at Mount Sunset aren't you glad amen aren't you glad that God gave us this message in this hour aren't you glad that God gave us such Vindication Amen to the world is foolishness to the world it's it's unknown tongues amen but to the Bride of Jesus Christ it's God's completing his love letter oh my every time I talk about love letters I think about my wife and I's courtship amen 50 that was 52 years ago we was married 51 years ago but 52 years ago we were courting and amen I didn't have a car and she lived 110 miles away so we courted by letter amen there weren't many phones back in those days and there weren't any cell phones at all amen so the only communication she and I had was by letter and those letters was like a hundred and 110 pages long hey man you talk about a courtship amen then one day she got a letter from me and said would you be my wife in that letter amen and I nervously impatiently waited for the reply amen and it had one word in the letter yes Hallelujah [Applause] amen so we're seeing what God Amen has given to the bride he's given us such a love letter amen that nobody else can open it and you say Amen that letter with the response to my proposal amen was addressed to Frank Prater when it arrived in the mailbox my sister didn't open it my brother didn't open it my brother-in-law didn't open it amen it was meant for my eyes and my eyes alone [Applause] you say praise the Lord amen and I want you to know something church amen the reason the world is so against this message amen they don't know that it is the invisible Union of the Heavenly groom in the Earthly bride man but we do right amen we know what it is so let me ask you the question what is the attraction on Mount Sinai the prophet being prepared the conversation went something like I've already told you Moses arguing with God I'm not your man I'm not ready amen I can't do this I can't even talk Flame amen God wasn't looking for Moses's language God wasn't moving for Moses's abilities God was looking for a man amen that would do what he was told to do right amen we understand that when Moses complained to God said God I can't even talk plain how can I go down and Lead these people out Pharaoh is not going to listen to me what was it that God said back to him don't worry I'll give you Aaron and he'll speak for you is that right amen Aaron will walk into the presence of pharaoh with you amen and you know the task is going to be hard they're not going to willingly let these children go amen but I'll go with you I'll be there with you every step of the way Moses I can't do it Lord don't worry about it Moses I'm sending Aaron with you what's it mean to us Church don't worry about it amen commit it to God and God will send the Holy Ghost to take care of the situation Can't Rap amen God don't expect amen you to bring it he expects the Holy Ghost to bring it to you the Holy Ghost somebody say the Holy Ghost will do amen amen so the conversation is going on now Moses begins to say well when I get down there they're going to want to know who sent me right they're going to want to know your name God's purpose is being revealed amen you tell them that my name you see up until this point God didn't even have a name is that right up at this point until God begins to talk to Moses amen God didn't even have a name but you go tell them I am that I am you set me hey man you know what this thought conveys to Moses it kind of cuts the conversation short kind of cuts the conversation where Moses is standing there finding every excuse in the world why he can't go and God giving him every reason why he can go this cuts the conversation short Moses say man has to agree now that God conveys a thought to Moses amen by telling him you tell them that I am that I am has sent you Amen in other words Moses amen here's God saying Moses take the worry out of it I'm in charge of this he's amen I'm in charge I've got it all geared out ain't nobody else Moses don't you worry I'll do the work that's where some of us bride people need to surrender amen God thank you I give up I'll let you take over I'll give every situation into your hands I'll quit trying to do it I'll let you do it do you say amen amen I remember the Night February 1 1970 a 20 year old boy praying at an altar amen just off of his deathbed just back from Germany out of the army walking down to an altar in a little Baptist Church didn't even know how to pray just knew that amen it was time for me to give up I remember the prayer I prayed Lord I've tried everything in the world I've done it my way I want to surrender to your way oh my God God will take over if you'll let him okay God will take over if you let him so when Moses hears God say you tell Pharaoh that I am that I am amen has sent me not only does Moses understand what God is saying when he tells pharaoh Pharaoh understands I'll get some more of that in just a moment ultimately the purpose of God's actions the whole thing is to let another generation know that there is a Promised Land you say amen amen now what do you mean brother Prater to let another generation know that there is a promised lamb who is it that takes the promised land Church amen is it that original group that God sent Moses down to after that Mount Sinai experience amen or is it a whole new generation that comes that crosses over into the promised land so everything that God is doing from the beginning of Moses out Mount Sinai amen all the way down to Mount Nebo you know Mount Nebo is where Moses is taken so everything between there everything amen is God dealing with a new generation amen amen in other words there has to be a new birth there has to be a death to an old nature there has to be a death amen to what we call what brother Bram calls the first husband right amen the old nature must pass away that the new man amen can live the new bride can come forth amen now everything that God does I hope I'm making myself clear on this amen bringing Moses to Mount Sinai and bringing him back to Mount Sinai this new generation that's coming up is going to be the one that takes the promised land and the promised land is a type of the Rapture is that right a type of our possessing our inheritance so everything that God is doing here amen is testifying to the new generation amen that you are going to take the promised land he might be talking to you today Amen in your mind you might have thought lord I can't go any further I can't do this anymore but God says I'm in charge I'll take you across you've just gotta let the old nature the old man die and have a new birth amen why do you say that for brother Prater God's doing everything amen that he can to tell the people there'll be a new generation Exodus 10 2. this is God telling Moses what his purpose is and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son's son what things I have wrought in Egypt and my signs which I have done among them that ye may know that I am the Lord just think about the purpose now the whole thing that God has just revealed Moses amen your son you're going to have sons and your sons are going to have sons amen and I want them to hear about the way that I've done this you say amen amen I think we're getting very close to rapture I think the generation that God's speaking to in Exodus 10 and 2. amen may be sitting in this building tonight amen the sons you know it goes right down to the fourth generation from the prophet that takes the Rapture now that's a whole new message you understand that you say the fourth generation from the prophet watch this church amen we go back to the age of the Prophet the time of the Prophet you were talking about William Branham right amen you know who was there with him my mom and dad right generation number one Then There came me generation number two Then There came my son generation number three and now my grandson's generation number four amen it looks like one of those boys is rising up in his spirit amen that's going to say Amen to the word of God can you say praise the Lord amen it gets real exciting amen it's always the fourth generation from the prophet that gets the job done I think we're in rapturing time Church Hallelujah to God Amen so that you may know how that I am the Lord amen was the whole purpose that God is doing this bringing him down to the generation that's going to possess the promised land now at this revelation of I am that I am amen God lets Moses know I've already prepared the way amen the provided way for the day you ever hear that phrase God's Got a Way provided for this day amen and that statement church is always so important amen that God sent a prophet to us to tell us the same thing amen this is God's provided way for this day you understand I don't know how long you're used to having church I know you're used to having it for three hours but amen I I don't know about Friday night so amen if somebody will just tell me when I've gone long enough then I'll stop amen because I've got I've got 24 more hours of this right amen God's provided a way for the day is always very important isn't it I mean it was always important in The Exodus Journey it'll always be important in our journey to know what God's provided way for the day is amen amen amen it becomes a point of failure for the Hebrews and the journey they always are failing to see God's provided way for the day amen they failed to see it at the Red Sea where God will further reveal himself without changing the original revelation now remember how it starts I am that I am right I mean God will never change that revelation but he can add to that Revelation that's the difference between a truth and a lie amen you can add to truth but you can't change the truth right that's the way you get caught up in a court of in a criminal court amen they try to get you to cross yourself up and if you ever tell a lie on the witness stand amen you will get crossed up by an expert examiner but if you always tell the truth amen they'll never get you mixed up right amen but you can add to that truth in other words so much today and so much tomorrow and so much the next day amen you can add to it but it will never change so God wants to continue to reveal himself Amen to these people and they begin to reject God's provided way for the day how did he do it they fell at the Red Sea where God as I've already said further reveals himself amen how did he reveal himself to Moses at the bush I am that I am now they've come up to a barrier to the promised land the first big barrier that they'll ever ever encounter Amen to the promised land journey is the Red Sea what did God reveal himself as at the Red Sea I am or Jehovah the Lord of hosts right what was what is the word Jehovah what amen same thing as Moses I will provide I am the Lord of hosts what does he say the Battle Is Mine amen amen amen Jehovah will sin a way out of this situation how will he get us out of the situation the captain of his host will come amen right I am the Lord of hosts is how he's revealing himself to Moses when he when away is needed at the Red Sea or at the walls of Jericho or when Messiah is announced by John the Baptist amen it's always the Lord of hosts shows up on time Galatians 4 when we were children when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons when it was time amen for these things to happen Jehovah of host shows up amen why to take charge again to get the job done when it was time for the Old Testament Saints Amen to be resurrected and to go into Glory who was it that showed up to bring them amen out of the Earthly Graves and to take them into the Rapture for the Old Testament Saints what was it that the Angels were crying out what was it that the saints were crying out open up your gates open up amen the Lord of hosts Mighty in battle is here always Church hey but when it's time the Lord of hosts will show up on your behalf and open the gates and take care of the problem he'll get you out of this situation amen always the Lord of hosts will show up amen who was it that showed up on the west side of Jordan amen after the new generation had entered into the Promised Land which is a type of us today amen the great big battle of where Jericho was coming now once they got into the promised land Jericho is the first great big battle who is it that shows up to encourage Joshua who does he meet outside of the city walls of Jericho amen who was it that showed up amen the captain of the hosts of the Lord you know who that is don't you all right amen that's Jesus Christ I want to tell you something the captain of the Lord's host is here tonight also amen you sang it as I came to the pulpit amen you changed the words to the song very aptly so I never had heard it sung that way but what a good night for it to be sung amen he is here because he is here Glory the Lord of hosts Maddie in battle now the remember the whole purpose is about the new generation that's going to cross over and if time allows while I'm here this weekend we're going to look at them and how they were prepared to get into the Promised Land hey man those that failed in the wilderness were not the ones amen that entered into the Promised Land they failed because of unbelief they just would not or could not accept God's provided way for the day right amen They didn't accept God's provided way with the manna remember the reason God sent the men what was it they were crying out again well they were complaining against Moses right would to God that we would state in Egypt at least we had wild onions to eat well I jerk some out of my uh front yard the other day and my wife fried them up and they weren't all that good to tell you the truth about it I mean they were there and that was about it we didn't eat them all well here these people are crying out for something that's so detestable to us today oh my others think about it so God said what else I'll send Mana your way and what was in the manner amen a sweetness that supplied every need they have now that I don't want a message on the matter amen but everything they had need of was in that manner it was sweet to them right just like the message of the hour sweet to us amen sweeten the mouth and bitter in the belly but it's sweet isn't it and then but they complained about the manna that God sent once they had because he said it because they had complained now they he gave them the answer and they complained about the answer doesn't that sound like message believers sound like the church oh Pastor don't know about that and they're both complaining about the same thing that's not this church though right no nobody in in Good Shepherd amen ever ever does the pastor like that not here and not in Eagle Lighthouse Tabernacle leader amen so what did God do when they got to complaining about the the sweetness the sweet bread and they said okay then I'll I'll send you some meat oh buddy did he unload meat on him amen if I'm not mistaken brother Jordan the Bible teaches us that the meat was about waste deep to the people wherever they went wherever they looked there was quail amen there was meat everywhere but what did they get to do about it Church complain you remember when the Bible said let us not lust as they also lusted this is what it's talking about amen what were they lusting for previous things oh let us go back what to God that amen we could eat what we ate in Egypt I want you to know something you ever get the Holy Ghost that world is never going to taste good to you again will you ever get sealed by the Holy Ghost hey you won't want that world anymore if you're having trouble pressing through and even thinking that the message of the hour is just so restrictive and takes so much away from me you haven't contacted the Holy Ghost yet maybe because the Holy Ghost is better even than anything that you have the that you could give up anything amen so they were lusting after previous things sometimes we get in the same shape we lust after previous things they were always just failing to see what God has provided so God leads him to Mount Sinai and on Mount Sinai amen which is God coming down this time Moses returning to Mount Sinai Sinai however you say it Moses returns it's his second visit Maybe at least his second visit Amen in these on Mount Sinai and God has just given them tremendous things come down in the pillar of fire you know writing the Ten Commandments and giving them instructions giving them word and what's the people begin to do amen once the prophet don't return right away what do the people do amen they begin to in false god they begin to get a priesthood to give them a false god is that right Church amen give us a false word give us a false message give us something that we had in Egypt kind of like the church is going now amen give us something uh brother random's teaching you know it's got legalism in it and we're on this subject in our church right now oh my brother random they'll tell you brother random's message that's got so much legalism in it that nobody can live it ever hear it if you guys haven't heard it you're going to somebody's going to try to convince you that your mom and dad amen is in a cult and they're trying to teach legalism as a way to God Amen but listen to me church amen legalism is for you to judge yourself it's not for you to judge anybody else he said if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged amen you don't look at another person and say that person ain't doing right that person is doing this that or the other amen you're not the judge you've got to try to use something to help yourself amen get right with God amen so they have all these issues and all these problems and well God comes down on the mountain in tenderness again right amen it says to Moses if you'll follow my way if you can get the people to listen to my word if you'll get to people just to follow I will be Jehovah Rapha to them you say amen I will be Jehovah Rapha what does it mean I am the Lord that healeth all somebody say all of thy diseases I'm not going to leave anything undone I'm the Lord that healeth all you know what he had just done and I'm going to bring this to a close right after this part you know what God had just done when he said when he when he revealed himself to them as Jehovah Rapha the Healer is that is that right the the Healer Jehovah Rapha he had just bought them from a place called Myra right he just bought them amen when he reveals himself as Jehovah Jireh it's right after he had them over here at the Wells of the will of Myra you know what Myra means bitterness and the people are coming through the Wilderness again and all mine they're all upset you know the the water the water we can't drink the water bitterness the water's so bitter we can't drink it the life is so harsh we can't live it the message is so difficult amen the preachers amen but what did God do for the bitter Waters he healed them what did how did he heal them he showed Moses a tree on the banks of the water Moses cuts the tree down and goes it throws it into the water and what does it do become sweet enough to quench every thirst amen and brother random says in talking about this he said there's a tree tonight spiritually speaking hanging over Golgotha or the world tonight that'll sweeten any bitter Waters that you may be led by you say praise the Lord that's right that's right Church amen God is going to reveal himself as Jehovah Jireh Jehovah again amen Jehovah of course is the the main name of God in the Bible I believe it's used over 6 000 times the Mighty God uh Rafa amen I I am the god the healthy so he had him out here in the Wilderness at this journey and they come to these bitter Waters he sweetens the water for them by Moses taking a tree and throwing it into the water amen and brother Branham brings in the illustration if there's bitterness in my life is there anything in my life amen that is bitter I always take it to Calvary I always look to Calvary why would you look to Calvary amen because at Calvary I see you amen my God Almighty hanging on a cross you say amen I see him amen as the Son of God hanging on the cross even to make my life sweet to make my life amen change to give me hope amen again brother Brown said Calvary will Sweeten any experience is your life bitter tonight is the message bitter to you amen has it become to the point that it's just you know just I don't want to go any further so God I'm almost done for the night so God brings them amen from the bitter Waters that he makes sweet with the tree he brings them to this place called Elam NOW Watch What Happens they were just complaining about what God had provided for them and even though they're complaining God says here it is I'll change it for you I'll Make It Sweet regardless of what's in your life I'll make it sweet for you and then he leads them to this place called Elam and you know what they find at Elam they found 12 Wells of water right enough for everybody at one well for each tribe in other words everybody amen can get a part of what God has provided even though they were complaining and God had to go through all this amen God still is providing them away he's got an answer he's providing the way for them all of these are a type of the message now amen not only do they find a spring 12 Springs of water or spring for every tribe so that everybody's thirst can be quenched everybody provides 70 palm trees you know how many Elders they're going to have in the camp of Israel you know how many men are chosen in the camp of Israel 70 of them 70 palm trees that each one of these counselors can go and rest in the shade of a palm tree as it reflects upon his responsibilities to his people God has a provided way for your church when I returned we're going to go back down into Egypt now if that is it brother latte has me come back amen we're going to go back down to Egypt and begin with pharaoh see on this but right now we're at this place that God has provided it's God's provided way for the day everything in it amen is what God has provided for you so that you amen will be sure to go in the rapture don't you want God's provided way over top of your way don't you want what God has provided
