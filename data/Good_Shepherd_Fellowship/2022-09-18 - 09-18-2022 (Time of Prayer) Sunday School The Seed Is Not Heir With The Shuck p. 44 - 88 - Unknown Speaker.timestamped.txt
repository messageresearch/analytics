[0:33] so
[0:34] [Music]
[1:14] i believe here that i take a text like
[1:18] this very odd unusual but
[1:20] sometimes we find god in those odd
[1:24] unusual hours unusual ways unusual
[1:27] things because god is unusual and those
[1:31] that really serve him from their heart
[1:34] serve him in an unusual way
[1:36] to the things are the ways of the world
[1:39] this text is called
[1:41] the seed
[1:42] is not air with the shuck
[1:46] paul here is speaking of the literal
[1:49] seed of abraham's two sons
[1:52] paul gladly is bringing himself in the
[1:55] position of
[1:57] the birth
[1:58] by the free woman now we know that
[2:00] abraham
[2:02] had two sons by two different women
[2:06] god gave him a promise by sarah
[2:09] through sarah rather that there would be
[2:12] a son born and through this son the
[2:15] world would be blessed all nations would
[2:19] be blessed of this son and it's commonly
[2:23] believed especially amongst the jews
[2:25] that this was isaac
[2:27] but it wasn't
[2:29] this promised son of abraham is jesus
[2:33] and he is of the royal seed promise of
[2:36] abraham
[2:37] but
[2:38] abraham having two sons one by
[2:42] by hagar
[2:43] which was
[2:44] his
[2:45] wife's maid a lovely pretty
[2:49] egyptian
[2:50] maid that abraham had picked up down in
[2:53] egypt
[2:54] for her
[2:55] to be
[2:56] her his wife's maid
[2:58] and sarah
[3:00] thinking that god would not be able to
[3:02] keep all of his promise true
[3:04] she told abraham to take agar her
[3:08] maid and to marry her which polygamy was
[3:11] legal in those days
[3:13] and to bring the child and that's the
[3:16] way god had it planned
[3:19] that she was to have the child only
[3:22] through agar
[3:23] but we find out that that wasn't so
[3:27] now we understand also that god is
[3:31] perfected in threes
[3:34] now god is perfected in threes
[3:37] grace is five
[3:39] seven is completion like the world god
[3:42] is perfected in father son holy ghost
[3:47] that's a perfection of the godhead
[3:50] all one god in three manifestations of
[3:54] three attributes of one office of three
[3:56] offices in the one godhead
[3:59] now
[4:00] there is also three imperfection of the
[4:04] steps of grace to the church
[4:07] justification sanctification baptism of
[4:11] the holy ghost
[4:12] that consists
[4:14] of the new birth
[4:16] just like a natural birth is tied to by
[4:20] which a woman giving birth to a child
[4:23] the first thing comes forth is
[4:25] water
[4:27] blood
[4:28] then life the bible said in first john 5
[4:31] 7 or 7 5 i believe it is that said there
[4:34] are three that bear record in heaven the
[4:37] father the word which was the son and
[4:40] the holy ghost these three are one there
[4:43] are three that bear witness in the earth
[4:45] the word the water blood and spirit
[4:49] water blood and spirit these three agree
[4:52] in one
[4:53] now the father son and holy ghost are
[4:56] one you can't have the father without
[4:59] having the son you can't have the son
[5:00] without having the holy ghost but you
[5:02] can be justified without being
[5:04] sanctified you can't be sanctified
[5:06] without being filled with the holy ghost
[5:08] we prove that in the order of nature now
[5:11] many of you may i may be strange to you
[5:14] and uh i'm without education i'm sure
[5:17] you already understand but are teaching
[5:20] types
[5:20] as a natural types of spiritual
[5:23] now we see that there are three in the
[5:26] perfection
[5:27] god is perfected in trees
[5:30] now
[5:31] and that was in the perfection of the
[5:34] seed of abraham
[5:36] was
[5:37] ishmael
[5:38] isaac
[5:39] jesus
[5:41] ishmael coming from the bond woman isaac
[5:44] coming from the free woman
[5:46] and both of them with sex but christ
[5:50] jesus coming from the virgin
[5:54] no sex
[5:56] hear the seed
[5:58] one
[5:59] one seed not seeds
[6:02] but one
[6:03] seed
[6:04] these others were not seed of abraham
[6:08] because abraham seed was his faith seed
[6:13] that god was speaking of not his natural
[6:16] seed
[6:17] because after
[6:19] sarah died abraham married another woman
[6:21] and had seven sons besides daughters
[6:25] so it wouldn't be abraham's seeds it was
[6:28] abraham seed one
[6:31] and that was
[6:32] abraham's faith seed pointing to the
[6:36] royal seed that was to come through
[6:38] abraham's faith
[6:40] not abraham's natural life but abraham's
[6:43] spiritual life
[6:44] who took everything contrary to god's
[6:47] word and called it as though it was not
[6:49] and believe god against hope believed in
[6:52] hope
[6:53] that's the real seed that we're speaking
[6:56] of
[6:57] here we are presented with a picture o
[7:00] the seed started the seed of promise
[7:03] started in a slightly
[7:06] doubted
[7:07] doubt of the original promise
[7:10] see it starts low
[7:12] and doubt in the original promise god
[7:15] promised
[7:16] abraham through sarah
[7:18] to have this child but now watch the
[7:21] first seat of abraham by the bonds woman
[7:24] come by sarah
[7:26] doubting that this could happen
[7:28] because she was old and past the age of
[7:30] baron
[7:32] now that's how the church starts that's
[7:34] how it always starts
[7:36] you start from the bottom you don't
[7:38] start from the top
[7:39] a man trying to climb a ladder tries to
[7:41] get on top first he'll break his neck
[7:44] you've got to start and build up to that
[7:47] and here we find the beginning
[7:50] of the promise of god being made
[7:53] manifest
[7:54] through a slightly doubted interrupted
[7:58] program of god amen that's the same way
[8:01] sin began in the garden of eden
[8:03] that's how death started by sin was when
[8:06] one word of god was misconstrued or
[8:09] doubted
[8:11] you can't doubt or misplace one word of
[8:14] god that's the saith the lord
[8:17] word be sold
[8:19] and here's sarah even to who the promise
[8:23] sarah being a woman which is a type of
[8:25] the church
[8:26] gave doubt to the original program of
[8:29] god's promised word and said you abraham
[8:33] my husband take unto you this beautiful
[8:36] maid and live with her and be a husband
[8:39] to her and
[8:41] god will give this seed a promise to her
[8:44] and i'll take the child see
[8:46] just bypassing one little iot change the
[8:50] whole program
[8:53] therefore we've got to take every word
[8:54] of god as thus saith the lord
[8:58] every word of god is true
[9:00] here the seed starts then in a promise
[9:04] slightly doubted isaac being the seed of
[9:07] the free
[9:09] and promised woman brought forth as paul
[9:12] was trying to explain here in galatians
[9:14] he brought forth the natural
[9:17] promised seed
[9:19] and he goes on to say here that the
[9:22] the bonds woman's children cannot be
[9:25] heir with the free woman's children
[9:28] because they are of two different
[9:30] categories and that is true the
[9:32] unbeliever cannot be
[9:34] heir with the believer
[9:36] there's no way at all that's where the
[9:38] trouble is today you can't make a
[9:40] denominational chicken believe with the
[9:42] eagle
[9:43] you just can't do it
[9:45] that's where the trouble comes you've
[9:46] got to believe every word of god
[9:50] you just you're not heirs together
[9:52] neither will you will you join with it
[9:54] you cannot do it you've got to be eagle
[9:56] or chicken amen
[9:59] it could not be air with ishmael the
[10:01] seat of the bonds woman all the because
[10:04] of the doubting
[10:06] sarah
[10:07] doubted god's word that god was able to
[10:11] keep it notice abraham
[10:13] you see what i'm billing over sunday
[10:15] morning
[10:16] abraham did not doubt it
[10:20] sarah did doubt it
[10:22] she was the one
[10:24] it was not adam it doubted it was eve
[10:27] that doubted it
[10:29] so
[10:30] then we find out more about those as we
[10:34] pick it up sunday morning neither can
[10:36] the spiritual be
[10:38] the natural be heir with the spiritual
[10:41] no more can
[10:43] ishmael's children be heir with the
[10:47] with isaac's children and no more than
[10:50] the carnal can be heir with the
[10:53] spiritual
[10:54] church natural church spiritual there is
[10:56] a church natural these women here type
[10:59] and is the church spiritual also so the
[11:02] natural church and the spiritual church
[11:04] cannot be heirs together
[11:07] there are two different separate times
[11:10] two different separate peoples under two
[11:12] different separate covenants
[11:15] that's why the rapture
[11:18] is
[11:19] different and will only be for the royal
[11:23] seed
[11:24] of abraham it cannot come by the natural
[11:28] carnal seat of the church
[11:31] it'll have to be the royal seat of the
[11:33] word of god
[11:34] through abraham the world scene that's
[11:37] why the rapture has to be first of
[11:39] course remember we which are alive and
[11:42] remain shall not hinder prevent those
[11:45] which are asleep for the trumpet of god
[11:47] shall sound that any christ shall rise
[11:48] first we which alive and remain shall be
[11:50] caught up with them together and meet
[11:51] the lord in the air
[11:53] notice and again it's written and the
[11:55] rest of the dead live not for a thousand
[11:58] years
[12:00] therefore there they will not be heirs
[12:02] together to not be in the rapture
[12:04] together there's absolutely a church
[12:06] natural and church spiritual
[12:08] a church carnal a church spiritual
[12:10] there see here is no there is no
[12:14] judgment to the royal spiritual
[12:16] predestinated seed of abraham
[12:19] or they are predestinated eternal life
[12:22] they have accepted god's provided
[12:24] sacrifice and that sacrifice which is
[12:26] christ the word
[12:28] and there is therefore now no
[12:30] condemnation saint john 5 24 if you want
[12:33] the scripture there is therefore now no
[12:35] condemnation to them that are in christ
[12:38] jesus romans 8 1
[12:40] walk not after the flesh but the spirit
[12:41] in romans 5 24 he that heareth my word
[12:46] the word there is understandeth any
[12:48] drunkard anything else can hear it walk
[12:50] away but he that heareth my word
[12:53] understands my word and believeth on him
[12:56] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[12:59] shall not come into the judgment
[13:02] but pass from death unto life yes earth
[13:07] he that this great mystery of the god
[13:10] made known understands
[13:13] how that god was in christ reconciling
[13:16] himself to the world how that he and the
[13:18] father were one
[13:20] how that the great mysteries of the
[13:22] fulfilling of god taking and bringing
[13:24] himself manifested in the age of human
[13:27] beings and in the stream of human beings
[13:30] and in the company of human beings to
[13:32] make his word manifested in the day in
[13:34] the eastern rising of the sun and to do
[13:37] the same thing as the sun sets in the
[13:39] west to make yourself manifested in a
[13:41] bride church
[13:43] the word may manifest
[13:46] it will to
[13:48] heed that understandeth that is to know
[13:51] that's been revealed to him of him that
[13:54] sent me has
[13:56] everlasting life and will not come into
[13:59] the judgment but it's passed from death
[14:01] unto life
[14:02] the natural seed was only a carrier of
[14:05] the spiritual
[14:06] the seed
[14:08] like the stalk tassel and shuffle we
[14:11] went through that before and another
[14:13] message but i'd like to preview it a
[14:15] little or go back to it again just for a
[14:17] minute now here there is three stages
[14:21] of the seed shows us the true picture
[14:25] the three stages of the natural seed in
[14:27] the earth
[14:29] like a seed is planted brings forth the
[14:31] stalk little blades shoots from it then
[14:34] the tassel then the pollen hangs on that
[14:36] and then the shuck and then the seed
[14:38] again
[14:40] what's these stages of this
[14:42] perfect parable you're in height works
[14:45] out exactly in the type because god is
[14:48] the author of all nature
[14:51] therefore nature cannot fail no more
[14:53] than god can fail because he was the one
[14:55] who set the thing in its condition for
[14:58] for us to look at and to see
[15:01] notice hagar the stalk
[15:04] which was the first beginning of the
[15:06] seed springing up
[15:08] now it didn't look anything like the
[15:10] seed it was a stalk because she was a
[15:12] bonds woman
[15:15] not in the promise at all
[15:17] nothing to do with the word just a
[15:19] transporter of the sea
[15:22] notice sarah the tassel
[15:25] that had the pollen that jewish nation
[15:28] raised from her
[15:30] from climate of sarah brought isaac
[15:33] through isaac bro jacob jacob brought
[15:36] the patriarchs into the patriarchs
[15:39] brought forth a nation
[15:41] marry the virgins faith
[15:43] produce the true spiritual
[15:47] seed
[16:08] notice sarah the tassel
[16:12] that had the pollen that jewish nation
[16:15] raised from her
[16:16] from climate of sarah brought isaac
[16:19] through isaac brought jacob jacob bro
[16:23] the patriarchs and to the patriarchs
[16:25] brought forth a nation
[16:27] mary the virgins faith produced the true
[16:31] spiritual
[16:33] seed
[16:35] word made flesh
[16:38] see the three women three women that
[16:41] this seed was carried to one of them was
[16:43] actually an adultery
[16:46] honor polygamy the second was a free
[16:48] woman and the third one had no sex
[16:51] affair at all
[16:52] but by faith she believed the word of
[16:54] god
[16:57] hagar
[16:58] sarah both sarah and hagar were sex but
[17:02] mary was virgin by the power of the
[17:05] promised word of god
[17:07] that's right
[17:09] the stalk hagar
[17:10] two wives
[17:12] doubted the promise
[17:14] but watch what that brought forth when
[17:16] hagar the second wife
[17:18] of abraham which was just absolutely a
[17:21] concubine wife but she brought forth a
[17:23] man but what kind of a man was he the
[17:26] bible said he was a wild man
[17:28] he lived by his bow
[17:30] and no man would conquer him he's
[17:32] untameable
[17:33] unconvertible undergenerated
[17:35] he could not be tamed he was a wild man
[17:38] because he was of the contrary to god's
[17:42] word in anything his contrary any
[17:44] preacher any lame member any church
[17:47] that's contrary to god's word will bring
[17:49] forth a wild adulterous
[17:53] bunch of worldly hollywood
[17:56] cannot stay with the unadulterated word
[17:59] because it's not even included in the
[18:00] promise
[18:02] sarah the true wife of the promise the
[18:06] being the torso brought forth a gentle
[18:08] man
[18:10] in uh returns brought forth a promised
[18:13] nation that served god
[18:16] but
[18:17] married by no sex at all
[18:20] but believed the promised word
[18:24] when she was a virgin knowing no
[18:26] man and the angel of the lord met her
[18:30] said hail mary blessed art thou amongst
[18:33] the women amen
[18:34] god is with thee
[18:37] and she said how will these things be
[18:40] she said angel said the holy ghost shall
[18:44] overshadow thee it had never been done
[18:46] in all the ages but married leave god
[18:50] and she said be hold the hands made of
[18:53] the lord
[18:54] she believed the word how's she going to
[18:56] have it she know that hagar had the baby
[18:59] by a sex desire with abraham and sarah
[19:02] had the baby by sex desire with abraham
[19:04] children of promise the bonds woman and
[19:06] the free woman but here she's asked to
[19:09] believe that's a contribution to the
[19:12] faith that was in abraham who believes
[19:15] the impossibles as long as god said it's
[19:17] so that makes it right
[19:20] all right she believed god
[19:23] never questions she said behold the
[19:25] hands made of the lord no matter how
[19:27] much criticism i have to bear from the
[19:29] world be unto me
[19:33] there come forth the genuine seed
[19:36] sarah cannot do it because it was sex
[19:39] it's right
[19:41] and neither could sarah because it was
[19:43] sex
[19:45] neither can the church under
[19:46] sectarianism
[19:48] that takes a virgin belief in the word
[19:50] of god that made the promise to bring
[19:52] poor children
[19:54] secretarianism will never bring forth
[19:56] these born church
[19:58] it cannot do to bring forth a
[19:59] substitutionary something it'll bring
[20:01] some for something that imitates it
[20:03] something that tries to be like it but a
[20:05] genuine born-again church of god please
[20:08] the word of god in the face of anything
[20:10] [Applause]
[20:11] [Music]
[20:13] because it's unadulterated it's by the
[20:16] promise of god that these things come
[20:18] mary the true one said by the outset
[20:21] said
[20:22] be it unto me according to thy word
[20:25] behold our hands mate and she brought
[20:28] forth what is she bringing forth not a
[20:30] wild man
[20:32] not a nation but she brought forth the
[20:35] word
[20:37] god himself
[20:39] they manifested in the flesh
[20:41] amen the true seed of god that
[20:45] manifested every promise that god made
[20:47] in the bible
[20:48] without him no man can live
[20:51] without him she was a true seat she was
[20:53] beyond the she was the shock that
[20:56] brought forth the grain
[20:58] now the other two was carriers of life
[21:01] only as a natural seed mary now remember
[21:04] y'all said the other two now mary don't
[21:06] make her god if some people tries to
[21:08] make her she was not a god
[21:11] no sir she was only a carrier of the
[21:14] seat like the rest of them was
[21:17] but like faith in the word brings more
[21:20] to the real image like as the corn
[21:23] matures or the wheat it comes forth to
[21:25] stop then it comes towards the pollen
[21:28] then it comes forth a shock
[21:30] but when you think that shuck if you
[21:32] don't watch it'll look just exactly like
[21:34] the real wheat but when it's opened up
[21:36] the real wheat's on the inside it's only
[21:38] a carrier again
[21:39] so you see mary not through sex but
[21:42] through faith something exactly like it
[21:44] mary was not that seed
[21:47] mary was a carrier of the seed he was a
[21:51] genuine faithy
[21:53] because the word of god is by faith that
[21:55] he give to abraham and only faith can
[21:57] produce what god said
[21:59] faith in his word
[22:01] notice how
[22:02] more like the real thing mary was
[22:05] but like the shepherd
[22:07] the shuck hugs a seed
[22:09] in itself and protects it and
[22:12] nurtures it
[22:14] until it's standing alone
[22:16] mature
[22:17] so has this third church age of
[22:19] pentecost
[22:21] matured holding the screen until it's
[22:24] time to open up the shop
[22:26] mary
[22:28] being the mother of christ just an
[22:31] incubator he was no blood of mary he was
[22:34] no blood of jew he was no blood of
[22:35] gentile he was the blood of god
[22:39] god created this blood he could not be
[22:40] sex
[22:41] he wasn't a junior gentile the baby is
[22:44] not one speck of the mother's blood the
[22:45] blood comes from the father
[22:47] we know the hemoglobins in the male like
[22:49] a chicken it can lay an egg a hen can
[22:51] but if she hasn't been with the male
[22:52] bird the rooster it'll never hatch
[22:56] it's unfertile though it looks exactly
[22:58] like a real fertile egg every nature of
[23:00] it looks the same but it hasn't got the
[23:02] life in it that's the way with people
[23:04] who profess christ many of them look
[23:06] like christians try to act like
[23:08] christians but you've got to have christ
[23:10] on the inside of you which is a word
[23:12] made manifest
[23:14] or it'll never mature into a real
[23:17] bible-believing christian it'll always
[23:19] be a denominational something
[23:21] it cannot live because there's no life
[23:23] in a tulip an egg cannot hatch it rots
[23:25] right in the nest if it hasn't been with
[23:27] a with a male bird just like members of
[23:30] a church you can baby them and call them
[23:32] make them deacons and everything else
[23:34] but
[23:34] you have a nest full of rotten eggs
[23:36] unless they mated with the meat that's
[23:38] right
[23:41] the shop it nurtured it that's right
[23:44] then it that is the seed itself has to
[23:47] leave the shuck
[23:49] or the shock has to leave the seed to
[23:52] get the seed in the presence of the sun
[23:54] so it can be ripened all in type we see
[23:57] see here now how close she the church of
[24:01] this last days gets to look like the
[24:03] seed itself
[24:06] look how this denomination of pentecost
[24:08] that's raised up in the last days and
[24:10] we'll explain it a little later on think
[24:12] how did it come so close to looking just
[24:14] exactly like the seed
[24:16] when a shuck comes forth out of a grain
[24:18] of wheat or a blade of wheat add to the
[24:20] pollen has fallen in there in a second
[24:22] stage and produced the third stage which
[24:25] is the the the shep
[24:28] and how that that if you are not a real
[24:31] post observer you'll never be able to
[24:33] tell but what that's a real grain of
[24:34] wheat in there when that first little
[24:37] grain comes forth looks like a grain but
[24:38] you sit down and open it up and you'll
[24:40] find out there's no grain there at all
[24:42] it's only a shook
[24:44] a carrier of the green now the green
[24:47] comes forth from that but remember there
[24:49] is no more after that sugar remember
[24:52] there was no more seed promise to a
[24:54] woman anywhere after mary
[24:56] and there's no more denominations
[24:58] promised after pentecost it's a
[25:00] rapturing bride coming forth from there
[25:02] the seed the word made manifest again
[25:05] notice
[25:07] see how close it looks
[25:09] [Music]
[25:59] you
