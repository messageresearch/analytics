[14:21] before i leave they're given a few
[14:24] announcements i'd like to make
[14:28] first of all the first one is thank you
[14:31] all for the support and the prayers you
[14:33] gave us
[14:34] or you made for us as you know simon was
[14:37] graduating yesterday
[14:39] and the graduation went very well
[14:42] and for those who streamed thank you for
[14:46] uh watching the graduation thank you
[14:48] brother steve cassidy and sister kelly
[14:50] for
[14:51] coming over and supporting too
[14:54] simon was very happy so i think he said
[14:57] he's gonna
[14:58] set up the time we'll get together for a
[15:01] party to
[15:02] you know uh celebrate his uh graduation
[15:05] at a later date and i think he said how
[15:08] long
[15:08] two weeks yeah yeah after two weeks
[15:12] we'll let you know the date and exact
[15:14] time
[15:14] so we'll set it we'll send it out as an
[15:16] announcement
[15:18] uh the second thing is about the
[15:21] fountain out there we shut off the
[15:22] fountain because of the covered
[15:24] the rules were saying people should not
[15:26] share because of the rate of
[15:28] transmission
[15:28] so if you see a notice there shut off
[15:31] fountain there's no water
[15:32] actually water is there but the fountain
[15:34] is short so if you've put cups there if
[15:36] you need to drink water

[16:07] work time off and also when it comes to
[16:10] cleaning
[16:11] uh i think that it has brought
[16:14] it was brought to our attention that

[16:18] okay children are chewing gum and
[16:20] throwing it on the floor
[16:21] and it's so hard to get it out so please

[42:53] i want to remind us we have in our
[42:56] brother's
[42:57] meeting coming up next saturday there
[43:00] are some changes
[43:01] because of
[43:03] [Music]
[43:05] we taught the dennis who have been able
[43:07] to host us
[43:10] but uh they are very busy by the time
[43:14] that we want to be there
[43:16] which of course it will have created
[43:18] some distraction for us
[43:20] so uh brother jordan and his family are
[43:23] not in town so
[43:26] we will communicate that to him when he
[43:28] gets back
[43:29] what i thought would be good for us to
[43:31] do is that
[43:33] we have this tent up and the grass is
[43:37] just growing under it
[43:39] it's not meant for grass to grow on it
[43:41] it's meant for people to sit down and
[43:43] fellowship
[43:44] so instead of going to dennis we will be
[43:47] at the back of the church here under the
[43:49] tent
[43:50] to talk the things that concern us
[43:52] realize that
[43:54] the i mean the heat wave has been coming
[43:57] our way these uh
[43:58] few days and also the changes in the in
[44:02] the city
[44:03] uh max regulation we want to talk about
[44:07] that
[44:08] what would be good for our assembly
[44:11] so that among other few things we want
[44:14] to talk
[44:15] next saturday and for that reason that's
[44:18] the reason why we
[44:20] we did not announce our convenience
[44:22] service
[44:23] so uh we will look forward to see if we
[44:27] can do that in the coming
[44:29] sundays praise the lord so brothers uh
[44:33] uh next saturday or this coming saturday
[44:38] at 10 a.m if we can be able to make it
[44:41] year and then we will we will reach out
[44:45] to you
[44:45] in a week and but what i was thinking is
[44:48] the other
[44:50] maybe other brothers can put on their
[44:52] apron and face
[44:54] their best breakfast and bring it for us
[44:57] but
[44:57] we will decide on what to do praise the
[45:00] lord
[45:01] amen i don't know where my my cooking
[45:04] skills are but i think i can
[45:06] i can bring you some burn pancakes
[45:14] praise the lord and so
[45:17] that is for next week uh just like i
[45:19] said brother
[45:20] jordan and uh and his wi-fi away
[45:25] brother andrews and uh and his family
[45:27] are also away
[45:29] uh we want to keep them in our prayers
[45:32] we'll continue to remember brother
[45:34] jordan there that the law will bring him
[45:36] through
[45:37] his illness before we turn
[45:40] over to other things we want to do this
[45:42] morning we want to
[45:44] welcome my brother and a friend brother
[45:46] orlando
[45:48] and uh brother orlando
[45:51] uh he has reason by work
[45:54] to uh travel over to
[45:57] uh bemidji for work
[46:01] and
[46:02] [Music]
[46:04] as a christian as a believer he sought
[46:07] to find a place of fellowship
[46:09] and some of the brothers put him in
[46:11] contact with us
[46:12] and and so all through his trip he was
[46:17] keeping in touch with us until he got
[46:19] down to
[46:20] uh his place of work
[46:24] and then he asked that i text him the
[46:26] the church address i text him
[46:28] texting the address it was about 3 hours
[46:30] and 30 minutes almost 4 hours away
[46:34] and but then he told me that he will
[46:37] stay
[46:38] be able to make it to come and and
[46:41] fellowship with us so we had the
[46:43] privilege of having our brother
[46:44] with us so we would just ask him to come
[46:48] and bring greetings from his church and
[46:51] and his family come on brother
[47:04] i greet you all in the name of our lord
[47:06] and savior jesus christ
[47:08] my name is brother orlando my wife's
[47:11] name is
[47:12] gina we go to um christian life
[47:15] tabernacle there in bedford
[47:17] texas so i'm from texas so the reason
[47:20] why you
[47:22] experiencing heat right now is because
[47:25] i'm here
[47:27] [Music]
[47:28] i don't say that as a joke i really
[47:31] believe that
[47:32] because i know who i am in christ jesus
[47:35] um
[47:37] january this january on 16th
[47:41] 2006 um
[47:43] i seen god do the greatest miracle that
[47:46] he's ever performed that i know of
[47:49] uh i've heard about what jesus did i
[47:51] heard about what moses did crossing the
[47:53] sea
[47:54] even what um brother brown did with
[47:57] squirrels and
[47:59] people that he healed but on this date
[48:02] i seen god do the greatest miracle ever
[48:05] ever he's ever done that i know of and
[48:07] that's what he did inside of me
[48:13] i didn't know anything about the message
[48:15] but through that experience
[48:17] you know i was actually on the run from
[48:20] the police and
[48:22] i ended up turning myself in and just so
[48:24] happened that the
[48:25] prison that i went in there was a
[48:26] minister that that was there that was
[48:28] preaching this message
[48:30] [Music]
[48:33] and through that i ended up you know and
[48:35] uh
[48:36] and so um uh
[48:41] i um and and so
[48:44] that's that's the greatest miracle and
[48:46] so
[48:48] and so when i travel and when i
[48:51] go places uh i travel all over because
[48:54] of the work
[48:55] and what's been allotted to me and um
[48:59] and so
[49:03] the psalm that was read 133
[49:07] it just it was like wow because it was
[49:10] the very thing that was on my heart
[49:12] you know to because he asked me to you
[49:14] know share
[49:15] and um and so because of this this
[49:18] experience that i had with god
[49:21] i can tell within just a few minutes if
[49:23] i'm in
[49:24] the presence of someone that has
[49:26] experienced the same thing that i have
[49:28] whether i talk to you or not i can tell
[49:31] and i guess it's just a gift god blessed
[49:35] me with
[49:37] so there are very few places that i've
[49:39] ever gone to
[49:41] that i'm able to actually take off my
[49:44] armor
[49:45] sometimes even my own very own home i
[49:47] have to keep it on but
[49:50] but i thank god that i can dwell in the
[49:52] place with brother and unity and
[49:55] i felt immediately when i come into his
[49:57] presence to be able to take off my armor
[50:01] and to feel liberty and freedom
[50:04] in this place god bless
[50:12] praise the lord praise him
[50:16] praise the lord amen
[50:20] amen people of god
[50:23] young people that presence is real
[50:30] it's it's real it's an abiding presence
[50:33] it's a it's a ever truth presence
[50:36] that never failed praise the lord
[50:40] no matter where you find yourself if you
[50:43] have ever experienced the holy ghost
[50:48] if you have that enduring presence in
[50:50] you a witness
[50:52] the scriptures say it bear witness that
[50:54] we are the children of god
[50:56] they bear witness to you of who you are
[50:59] and
[51:00] bear witness to you of who others are
[51:04] praise the lord so we thank the lord for
[51:07] that
[51:08] we thank the lord i mean i could i could
[51:10] just tell
[51:12] uh the passion that the brother had
[51:15] i mean he just drove up to uh uh
[51:20] came down from texas he stopped over at
[51:23] uh
[51:24] uh for brazil ave
[51:28] meeting and then stopped in iowa on
[51:31] wednesday night for service and then he
[51:34] drove down
[51:37] to his area of work and then he was
[51:39] ready to get back
[51:40] on the road to come again i mean with
[51:43] all of that traveling it was just
[51:45] enough to take take a week off
[51:48] that's why sometimes people we do just
[51:51] take a week off
[51:52] but you see it's it's not a bad thing if
[51:54] a person even do that
[51:56] but it's something different when the
[51:58] person has
[52:00] a burning burning desire in their heart
[52:03] to
[52:05] to fellowship with god's people
[52:08] and to be in the presence of the lord
[52:10] amen
[52:11] praise the lord and you know this net
[52:15] is not only coming coming in the service
[52:19] to be blessed but coming to be a
[52:21] blessing
[52:23] and i believe that even the testimony of
[52:26] our brother is a blessing
[52:28] amen they have they have helped to to
[52:31] to edify the saints they have helped to
[52:34] bless the atmosphere already
[52:36] so we just thank the lord amen praise

[1:00:30] that would be right after the book of
[1:00:32] judges

[1:00:38] people will give us the scripture there
[1:00:40] that's ruth chapter 3 we're reading from
[1:00:42] verse 1
[1:00:43] praise the lord hallelujah

[1:00:51] lot of redemption

[1:00:58] in the universe and it is beautiful
[1:01:01] when when we look at that let's just
[1:01:03] read the scripture
[1:01:04] yeah uh ruth chapter 3 if i'm right
[1:01:08] from verse 1 they now mean her
[1:01:11] mother-in-law
[1:01:12] said unto her my daughter
[1:01:15] shall i not seek rest for thee
[1:01:20] that they may be well within and just
[1:01:23] like we
[1:01:24] said ruth year is speaking
[1:01:27] in uh the first person
[1:01:30] but we know that ruth i mean naomi is
[1:01:33] speaking in the first person but we know
[1:01:35] that now mean is not the first person
[1:01:38] every first person expression in the
[1:01:40] scripture
[1:01:41] is god himself amen
[1:01:44] praise the lord
[1:01:48] and now it's not boss
[1:01:52] of our kindred with who's meeting their
[1:01:56] their wealth behold he wandered

[1:03:36] hebrew chapter 4.
[1:03:48] hebrew chapter four
[1:03:58] let's just read verse nine

[1:04:06] let's read verse nine so
[1:04:08] we can have i will see verse nine dare
[1:04:11] remember
[1:04:12] therefore a rest to the people of god
[1:04:17] for he that is enter into his rest
[1:04:21] he also has seized from his
[1:04:24] own works as
[1:04:28] god did from his let's pray together
[1:04:32] heavenly father we thank you
[1:04:36] we we just appreciate you lord the
[1:04:39] father we
[1:04:40] can have this opportunity lord this
[1:04:43] privilege
[1:04:44] to your open word and dear lord we pray
[1:04:47] that father the holy spirit will come
[1:04:50] break the word now to us of god give us
[1:04:53] give
[1:04:53] us the thanks lord father that is that
[1:04:55] is needful for our life
[1:04:57] things of internal value lord lord
[1:04:59] gather
[1:05:00] not just another lecture father lord all
[1:05:03] jesus oh god but we just want things
[1:05:05] that will brought us closer to you
[1:05:07] father lord god because
[1:05:10] your prophet said lord god father honor
[1:05:12] this ministry
[1:05:13] this word will change the items of our
[1:05:16] body
[1:05:17] father so we pray oh god that you will
[1:05:19] help us now lord
[1:05:21] may we all just get in father this
[1:05:23] morning
[1:05:24] lord may there not be one that will be
[1:05:26] left out to god
[1:05:28] even the little ones so father may they
[1:05:30] benefit from the atmosphere
[1:05:32] lord we thank you and we appreciate you
[1:05:34] in jesus name
[1:05:35] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:05:37] your seed there remembereth
[1:05:39] therefore a rest to the people of god
[1:05:44] that's why we were speaking on wednesday
[1:05:46] night praise the lord
[1:05:48] amen they're all the the entire
[1:05:51] purpose of god for saving you
[1:05:55] is to bring you to rest amen
[1:05:58] the entire purpose of this message
[1:06:03] is to bring you to rest that's why jesus
[1:06:08] in the early part of his ministry said
[1:06:11] oh ye the labour
[1:06:13] and that heavy lady come unto me and i
[1:06:15] will give you rest
[1:06:17] we see that in god's principle of
[1:06:19] creation
[1:06:22] after he have worked
[1:06:26] the sixth day the seventh day
[1:06:29] he came to rest but the principle there
[1:06:33] is that god will have never
[1:06:35] rested until he got a man
[1:06:39] in his image
[1:06:43] praise the lord amen so you realize
[1:06:47] that the entire purpose of creation
[1:06:50] was just not to make a beautiful flower
[1:06:53] of
[1:06:53] garden trees and animals the entire
[1:06:57] purpose of creation
[1:06:59] was to get a man
[1:07:03] in his image
[1:07:06] praise the lord so everything that god
[1:07:09] has given to us everything that he has
[1:07:12] created
[1:07:13] is to facilitate us to get to that place
[1:07:19] praise the lord are we together
[1:07:22] now so we realized that when when god
[1:07:26] achieved that when he was able to get a
[1:07:29] man
[1:07:30] in his image even though that man was
[1:07:33] not in a physical body
[1:07:34] because we know genesis 1 26 it was a
[1:07:37] man that was in a
[1:07:38] it was a spirit man let's say that and
[1:07:42] but because god has already achieved
[1:07:45] that now when you talk about spirit man
[1:07:47] you also realize that it was a spirit
[1:07:50] man
[1:07:51] in the mind of god because god has
[1:07:54] already achieved to have a man
[1:07:57] in his image
[1:08:00] praise the lord then the scripture says
[1:08:04] then he rested amen
[1:08:07] glory be to god are we together
[1:08:11] amen praise the lord
[1:08:14] praise the lord therefore there is a
[1:08:17] rest
[1:08:18] unto the people of god amen amen
[1:08:22] there is a rest
[1:08:26] there is a place that god will bring a
[1:08:30] man or bring a woman
[1:08:32] that's a place where god will even bring
[1:08:35] an assembly you know what paul talks
[1:08:38] that about
[1:08:39] in the book of ephesians where he says
[1:08:41] we are no longer
[1:08:42] you know running we are not toast about
[1:08:45] with every wings of doctrine
[1:08:47] you know i mean we're not looking for
[1:08:50] the new messiah or a new teaching to
[1:08:53] come on the scene
[1:08:54] you know we're not looking for another
[1:08:56] one-man ministry
[1:08:57] i mean there's a place where god will
[1:08:59] bring an individual
[1:09:01] there's a place that god will even bring
[1:09:04] a family
[1:09:05] amen that's a place where god will bring
[1:09:09] an assembly praise the lord
[1:09:14] amen and that place is a place of rest
[1:09:20] is a place of rest
[1:09:25] it's a place of rest
[1:09:28] and we realize that paul
[1:09:32] dear with that year in the in the hebrew
[1:09:35] letter
[1:09:36] and the way he dealt with it is that
[1:09:40] he brought it right from the joining of
[1:09:43] israel that god
[1:09:47] promised his people rest but they were
[1:09:50] not
[1:09:51] able to come unto that rest
[1:09:55] praise the lord and
[1:09:58] and and and he talks about that uh uh
[1:10:01] through hebrew year we'll look at that a
[1:10:03] little bit
[1:10:06] but we we see here that the
[1:10:09] the the entire purpose of god
[1:10:13] of of bringing us to rest
[1:10:16] is now something that we can achieve in
[1:10:19] ourselves
[1:10:21] it's not something that we can achieve
[1:10:23] in our strength
[1:10:25] praise the lord but there's a place that
[1:10:29] god
[1:10:30] wants a son of god or the daughter of
[1:10:33] god
[1:10:33] to get home praise the lord
[1:10:37] and then he do the rest so that's what
[1:10:40] we want to see yet a little bit in the
[1:10:42] life of ruth
[1:10:44] praise the lord glory be to god what
[1:10:47] almighty god will self
[1:10:49] amen what almighty god with self
[1:10:53] let's travel a little bit and uh and and
[1:10:56] and see here
[1:11:01] that when god
[1:11:05] we will look at creation we will go back
[1:11:07] to creation a little bit
[1:11:08] but we will see here the other uh god
[1:11:12] play out this
[1:11:13] this uh this thing in the life of uh
[1:11:16] of the hebrews of the children of israel
[1:11:19] now you have to realize that brother
[1:11:21] branham
[1:11:21] uh make us to understand that god raised
[1:11:24] up those people
[1:11:25] uh to to kind of for preserve a
[1:11:27] bloodline
[1:11:29] praise the lord and and in them with a
[1:11:31] lot of the times
[1:11:32] and the shadow now so god
[1:11:37] through the uh the promise that he gave
[1:11:39] to abraham in genesis chapter 15 your
[1:11:42] seed shall so
[1:11:43] join into a strange land and our god
[1:11:46] will bring them
[1:11:47] up we'll bring them out with a mighty
[1:11:49] hand
[1:11:50] and i would take them into a land
[1:11:52] flooring with milk and honey
[1:11:55] is that what he said that's what he
[1:11:57] promised him
[1:11:59] and uh and then we realized that uh
[1:12:02] as the years went by it took uh almost
[1:12:05] about 400 years
[1:12:08] for israel to get right into that
[1:12:10] condition for god to bring them out but
[1:12:12] we knew we realized that
[1:12:14] abraham isaac and then jacob jacob and
[1:12:17] his sons
[1:12:18] and and the bro and and the scripture
[1:12:20] and brother branham said because of
[1:12:22] jealousy they saw joseph and that's how
[1:12:25] joseph got there into egypt and then uh
[1:12:29] you know he sent for his his father his
[1:12:31] brothers they're all there into egypt
[1:12:33] the wheels of prophecy is turning around
[1:12:36] amen he says
[1:12:37] humanity for evil but god made it for
[1:12:39] good god sent me a head to preserve
[1:12:42] life the wheels of prophecy it is all
[1:12:44] turning around
[1:12:45] praise the lord and as the year went
[1:12:47] back there was a pharaoh that never knew
[1:12:49] joseph
[1:12:50] amen never knew the benefit that his
[1:12:53] gift was
[1:12:53] to the people of egypt not only the
[1:12:56] people of egypt brought to the people of
[1:12:58] the entire existing world
[1:13:00] because it was the gift of joseph that
[1:13:03] preserved the existing world at that
[1:13:05] time
[1:13:06] seven years of farming if there was not
[1:13:10] a gift to tell them what to do
[1:13:16] the people were going to die so it was
[1:13:19] joseph's gift amen
[1:13:23] that saved the world
[1:13:27] so right after that we realized that a
[1:13:30] pharaoh came in that never knew joseph
[1:13:32] and and then he started putting the
[1:13:34] people
[1:13:35] uh uh uh started taxing the people and
[1:13:38] you know and and all of that and
[1:13:41] uh but uh
[1:13:45] as that went by then and things were
[1:13:48] happening we know that you know god
[1:13:50] how to uh allow that to turn the heart
[1:13:54] of the people away from egypt because
[1:13:56] they were there in egypt they were in
[1:13:58] goshen they had good businesses good job
[1:14:00] complacency was coming in so god had to
[1:14:03] you know
[1:14:04] stir the water again to turn their heart
[1:14:06] over
[1:14:07] to the promised uh promised land now so
[1:14:12] what i want for us to watch is that god
[1:14:14] man is uh
[1:14:16] sent moses and uh moses bring a message
[1:14:20] you know uh let my people go and
[1:14:23] god is now preparing to take them
[1:14:26] into the promised land a land flowing
[1:14:29] with milk and honey
[1:14:31] praise the lord watch a principle here
[1:14:34] as we will study together
[1:14:36] exodus 28 verse 1.
[1:14:49] he actually starts from exodus chapter 3
[1:14:52] when god came down in the form of the
[1:14:54] pillar of fire the burning bush
[1:14:56] he called moses and he dared with moses
[1:15:00] in such a way that he lost his ability
[1:15:02] to speak
[1:15:04] and moses said he can speak and he was
[1:15:06] so nervous in the presence of god
[1:15:08] and god
[1:15:12] said your brother aaron will be your
[1:15:14] spoke man
[1:15:16] amen so they went down to egypt
[1:15:20] and you know them and moses were coming
[1:15:22] and killed to iran
[1:15:23] and iran will and uh will now address uh
[1:15:27] uh pharaoh and his men
[1:15:30] but as time went by we see here now when
[1:15:33] the people
[1:15:35] uh uh have come out of uh egypt
[1:15:39] god is not about to establish
[1:15:43] uh an order let me call it that way he's
[1:15:46] about to establish another
[1:15:48] now what is this order for to bring
[1:15:52] them to rest because they are going
[1:15:56] to elaine that god has promised
[1:15:59] their fathers a land that he said
[1:16:02] flooring
[1:16:02] with milk and honey now the the
[1:16:06] phrase milk and honey all have to do
[1:16:09] with rest
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:13] that's what god meant when he said milk
[1:16:15] and honey there was no
[1:16:16] literal place where milk and honey was
[1:16:18] flooring but like brother
[1:16:20] branham said in adoption he says you
[1:16:22] know it was a place that they can call
[1:16:24] their own
[1:16:25] a place where they would get tall and
[1:16:27] and plant their crops and
[1:16:29] and and sit around with their family
[1:16:31] talk about
[1:16:32] the story about the exit and a place
[1:16:35] they can call their own a place of rest
[1:16:37] yes
[1:16:41] they don't have to be looking over their
[1:16:42] shoulders
[1:16:46] praise the lord and that's where god
[1:16:49] wants to bring every one of us
[1:16:53] a place of rest yes
[1:16:56] amen a place where there is no
[1:17:01] habit that is chasing us
[1:17:04] a place where there is no familiar
[1:17:06] spirit or nothing of the word
[1:17:08] we know that we are in a place of rest
[1:17:10] we don't have to look over our shoulders
[1:17:13] and say what is this i mean you don't
[1:17:15] have to make no
[1:17:16] kind of an interpretation if you have a
[1:17:18] bad dream because you know you are in
[1:17:20] the place of rest
[1:17:25] praise the lord amen a place where you
[1:17:29] know
[1:17:30] that you know if the rapture should
[1:17:33] break
[1:17:35] you know that you will be stepping on
[1:17:37] the streets of glory
[1:17:38] you know
[1:17:42] you know you are convinced of that
[1:17:46] praise the lord oh you know there's a
[1:17:49] new body waiting for you in glory
[1:17:53] glory be to god if this afflict
[1:17:55] tabernacle
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:02] while the paramedic is coming in and
[1:18:05] they are talking about this
[1:18:06] you will step in your new body you'll be
[1:18:08] looking down there and
[1:18:10] you know that
[1:18:24] if anything is keeping you back from
[1:18:26] that feeling
[1:18:28] we have to deal with it
[1:18:36] you know that you know that you know
[1:18:40] glory be to god amen
[1:18:44] and you know god god is the one that lay
[1:18:47] the rules
[1:18:49] amen he gave john the baptist the holy
[1:18:52] ghost from his mother womb
[1:18:54] so he stepped he set a standard
[1:18:59] before age he gave the holy ghost so
[1:19:02] there is no age to the holy ghost
[1:19:06] that's right there is no age to the holy
[1:19:09] ghost
[1:19:10] praise the lord he can give it in the
[1:19:12] womb
[1:19:17] praise the lord he can give the holy
[1:19:19] ghost even before you cross this life
[1:19:22] so there is no there is no excuse
[1:19:26] amen are we together
[1:19:29] so this is said and now god is going to
[1:19:32] set an order
[1:19:33] he's going to set a principle how he
[1:19:36] going to bring these people
[1:19:39] into rest how he's going to help them
[1:19:42] as as simple as a way appeared
[1:19:45] you have to realize that
[1:19:48] uh jacob in blessing his children
[1:19:52] uh levi was giving a portion
[1:19:55] and the portion of levi was uh
[1:19:59] he was appointed the priesthood praise
[1:20:02] the lord
[1:20:02] but here is god coming and then he's
[1:20:05] he's coming now
[1:20:06] and leading his people into this place
[1:20:08] of rest he's using his prophet moses
[1:20:11] exodus chapter 28
[1:20:12] let's read verse 1. praise the lord
[1:20:18] exeter 28 verse 1 the scripture says
[1:20:26] and take down unto thee aaron thy
[1:20:29] brother
[1:20:30] and his sons with him from among the
[1:20:34] children of
[1:20:34] ezra that he may minister unto me
[1:20:39] in the priest's office even
[1:20:42] iran
[1:20:48] now god is now telling
[1:20:51] moses which of course he was the prophet
[1:20:57] to now call aaron
[1:21:01] and his sons to this calling
[1:21:06] that it will be set aside to break be
[1:21:09] the priests praise the lord
[1:21:14] amen from this was what
[1:21:17] started the aaronic priesthood right
[1:21:20] okay which of course that came out
[1:21:23] of the leviticus priesthood
[1:21:26] right amen are we together
[1:21:33] let's go to chapter 29
[1:21:36] you can read the rest of the chapter but
[1:21:40] we
[1:21:40] we just want to run over quickly and
[1:21:45] so we can get into chapter 29
[1:21:50] which of course is a continuation of
[1:21:52] chapter 28.
[1:21:55] god is saying over here to
[1:21:59] to moses call your brother aaron and his
[1:22:02] sons
[1:22:03] and then after you call them he talks
[1:22:05] about the effort he talks about the
[1:22:07] breastplate he talks about everything
[1:22:09] about that and then when he comes over
[1:22:11] here to 29
[1:22:12] he he he talks about you know taking
[1:22:15] elan the bullock and two rhymes and all
[1:22:17] of that
[1:22:18] but then let's drop down to verse four
[1:22:26] and aaron and his sons shall thou bring
[1:22:30] onto the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:22:33] congregation
[1:22:35] and thou shalt wash them
[1:22:38] praise the lord
[1:22:42] you call aaron and his sons and then
[1:22:45] you're going to bring them
[1:22:46] to the door of the tabernacle which is a
[1:22:49] public gathering
[1:22:52] amen it's a public gathering you're
[1:22:55] going to take them behind the curtains
[1:22:59] and they will strip their clothes and
[1:23:02] they will get into the basin
[1:23:04] now so this is moses now that is going
[1:23:07] to washington
[1:23:10] amen the prophet now is going to wash
[1:23:13] these people
[1:23:14] that are now going to be ministers
[1:23:17] that are now going to be priests praise
[1:23:20] the lord
[1:23:21] whatever idea they have from the
[1:23:23] levitical priesthood
[1:23:26] had to be watched amen
[1:23:29] for the matter of fact aaron was older
[1:23:32] than moses but yet god has to watch him
[1:23:36] of his idea as being the older brother
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:42] because now he's called to an office
[1:23:46] and moses had to wash them
[1:23:51] and as you go down and read the
[1:23:52] scripture
[1:23:55] he has to wash them and i shall take
[1:23:59] the government and pull it upon aaron
[1:24:01] the court and then when you go
[1:24:03] down verse 7
[1:24:07] then shall thou take
[1:24:11] an anointing oil and put it upon his
[1:24:13] head and anoint him
[1:24:15] now so what god is doing the ministry
[1:24:19] that the priesthood was the one that was
[1:24:22] going to help the people to bring them
[1:24:24] into rest
[1:24:28] that's the purpose of the ministry it's
[1:24:31] not just to be
[1:24:32] a sound barrier it's supposed to bring
[1:24:36] rest to the people it's not to create
[1:24:38] confusion in the minds of the people
[1:24:40] because we're not running race so moses
[1:24:44] was supposed to watch these people
[1:24:46] aaron and his sons and annoyed him
[1:24:50] and then when you go down in the reading
[1:24:52] he was supposed to
[1:24:54] dress them and the priests who are tired
[1:25:00] are we together amen
[1:25:03] he was supposed to dress them in the
[1:25:05] priests who were tired
[1:25:07] now god was he was setting out a
[1:25:11] spiritual principle because you see the
[1:25:14] thing that is that it's like brother
[1:25:15] branham said
[1:25:16] before anything happened on the earth it
[1:25:18] first take place in the heavens
[1:25:21] praise the lord and if and if in our
[1:25:24] spirit
[1:25:25] man we can never come to rest with god
[1:25:30] you can nev you can live in the most
[1:25:32] biggest home with
[1:25:34] uh with with sevens all over you and i
[1:25:37] mean
[1:25:37] and and and i mean you just it's a
[1:25:39] lazier
[1:25:40] island they can put you alone on that
[1:25:43] island
[1:25:43] if you don't have peace of god in your
[1:25:46] heart in your mind
[1:25:48] you are never going to be at peace with
[1:25:50] whatever you have
[1:25:52] you can have all the money in the world
[1:25:54] you can have i mean everything you want
[1:25:56] if that piece of god is not achieved
[1:26:00] in your act and in your mind there is
[1:26:03] nothing in this world that will satisfy
[1:26:06] you so you see god was
[1:26:09] establishing an order of inner peace
[1:26:14] for them before they can get to the land
[1:26:18] for them to have earthly peace
[1:26:26] praise the lord amen
[1:26:31] oh there is a rest unto the people of
[1:26:33] god
[1:26:34] glory be to god amen
[1:26:39] so moses how to bring aaron and his sons
[1:26:43] into this order
[1:26:45] he has to wash them this was a complete
[1:26:49] different divine order
[1:26:51] now under the levitical priesthood you
[1:26:54] were you were called to that priesthood
[1:26:56] by birth
[1:26:58] when you were born in the tribe of the
[1:27:00] levites
[1:27:02] but this priesthood is different it has
[1:27:05] to be the prophet moses
[1:27:07] taking instruction from god not calling
[1:27:10] the entire trap of the levites
[1:27:12] but now calling a household
[1:27:18] praise the lord
[1:27:21] oh glory be to god amen
[1:27:25] let's just take our time here we're just
[1:27:26] trying to lay some foundation
[1:27:28] praise the lord amen you see that's the
[1:27:31] reason why we just have a bunch of
[1:27:33] confusion
[1:27:34] all over christendom praise the lord
[1:27:38] all over christendom i mean people think
[1:27:40] the scriptures
[1:27:41] they're they're they're they put their
[1:27:43] their rap lyrics into it
[1:27:45] and they can run with it and amuse
[1:27:47] people and makes people to shaver
[1:27:49] and and no the ministry is supposed to
[1:27:52] bring you to rest
[1:27:57] and there is an order of rest
[1:28:01] we are one rest yeah but sometimes not
[1:28:03] many people want to be watched
[1:28:08] the watching part is the difficult part
[1:28:11] praise the lord you imagine moses is
[1:28:14] telling aaron buddy
[1:28:15] strip yourself i'm going to bear for you
[1:28:19] buddy i i beat you when you were just a
[1:28:21] little boy
[1:28:22] yeah amen
[1:28:25] [Laughter]
[1:28:27] but you see that's god's father
[1:28:30] that's god's order and that is the very
[1:28:34] same step
[1:28:36] that naomi told ruth
[1:28:40] to bring her to rest
[1:28:43] praise the lord the very same step
[1:28:46] come on you have to watch yourself
[1:28:50] you have to be anointed yes sir you have
[1:28:53] to change your women
[1:28:57] and you have to fall
[1:29:00] at his faith
[1:29:06] praise the lord glory be to god
[1:29:12] amen i know many times when we
[1:29:15] i mean we take bath and where our best
[1:29:17] is hard for us to get on the ground and
[1:29:19] knee down and worship the lord
[1:29:21] [Laughter]
[1:29:22] praise the lord but man
[1:29:26] how are we going to come to rest people
[1:29:30] amen so you see god was setting out a
[1:29:33] spiritual order
[1:29:34] now that was why paul referred to in the
[1:29:38] book of hebrew
[1:29:40] and said the people did not mix the
[1:29:42] promise with faith
[1:29:44] why because they did not recognize
[1:29:47] the spiritual order that god set for
[1:29:50] them amen
[1:29:53] and because they did not recognize it
[1:29:55] that was the reason why
[1:29:57] and and uh koran and dayton rebelled
[1:30:01] against moses
[1:30:04] they were rebelling against that
[1:30:05] spiritual order
[1:30:08] yeah someone says you take too much
[1:30:10] about yourself it's you and your brother
[1:30:12] aaron and
[1:30:13] and and and that's what they were
[1:30:15] fighting against
[1:30:17] you see because they never honored they
[1:30:21] never accepted they never received the
[1:30:24] spiritual other
[1:30:25] that was going to bring them to rest in
[1:30:28] the presence of god
[1:30:29] it was difficult even though the land
[1:30:31] was given to them
[1:30:32] they crossed the red sea the cross
[1:30:34] jordan joshua
[1:30:36] distributed the land to them amen
[1:30:39] but yet in their own giving inheritance
[1:30:44] they became slaves
[1:30:47] to the inhabitants they could never
[1:30:50] overcome
[1:30:52] because it's not by power it's not a
[1:30:55] might
[1:31:00] it's not a power it's not he that
[1:31:03] willeth
[1:31:04] it's not he that run that it's not he
[1:31:06] that knows everything
[1:31:08] but god has a structural principle
[1:31:11] and if you bypass god's principle there
[1:31:13] is no way
[1:31:16] god will bring you to rest
[1:31:29] paul amen they did not miss it with
[1:31:31] faith why because
[1:31:33] they missed the spiritual aspect why was
[1:31:36] god
[1:31:37] setting up this order for the tabernacle
[1:31:45] the scripture says the worshipper once
[1:31:48] parched
[1:31:51] he must go bad away from that confession
[1:31:54] with no sense of guilt
[1:31:58] that was rest
[1:32:02] when the worshiper once patched
[1:32:05] he must be able to turn around because
[1:32:09] he had found rest
[1:32:12] praise the lord amen but even though
[1:32:15] they were making sacrifice after
[1:32:17] sacrifice after sacrifice they could
[1:32:21] never come to rest
[1:32:27] they were growing right away from the
[1:32:28] house of god still going with their
[1:32:30] guilt
[1:32:34] so it was more like just performing
[1:32:37] their deal tech
[1:32:39] come to church perform their duty clap
[1:32:41] their hands pay their tithes and
[1:32:43] offerings
[1:32:44] and they know they have done their
[1:32:45] religion and it goes back
[1:32:48] but stay going back honor the burden
[1:32:51] of sin the burden of guilt
[1:32:55] that still haunts their mind that still
[1:32:57] haunts their spirit
[1:33:06] praise the lord and you see it all
[1:33:09] starts
[1:33:10] there from uh from
[1:33:13] kiddish you will realize that
[1:33:16] that uh uh
[1:33:20] paul spoke about that in the book of
[1:33:23] hebrew there in chapter two and three
[1:33:25] where he he points the people to the
[1:33:27] place
[1:33:28] of where uh uh uh numbers chapter 13
[1:33:33] when the spires went to to to spa the
[1:33:35] land
[1:33:36] praise the lord amen that's where paul
[1:33:40] was dealing with that's where they never
[1:33:41] missed the promise with faith
[1:33:43] because the eyes were looking at the
[1:33:47] natural things that were happening amen
[1:33:50] they were looking at the giants that
[1:33:52] were in the lane
[1:33:54] when they were supposed to be believing
[1:33:55] the promise of god
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:59] amen amen
[1:34:04] a thing that was supposed to uh be a 10
[1:34:07] 11 days joining for them
[1:34:10] became a wandering yeah
[1:34:14] it became a wandering
[1:34:19] became a wondering you see the devil
[1:34:23] got on the trail we know there by the
[1:34:24] opening of the seals
[1:34:26] and uh uh with this whole
[1:34:31] you know uh uh roman beats from daniel
[1:34:34] vision
[1:34:35] that took over the church and and we
[1:34:38] know the thing that
[1:34:40] that was brought to the church of making
[1:34:44] pennies
[1:34:46] you know how the catholic ch church
[1:34:48] taught that
[1:34:49] i mean for you to for you to show god
[1:34:52] you love him you got to
[1:34:53] suffer i mean you got to suffer you i
[1:34:56] mean
[1:34:57] suffering has to be seen on your skin
[1:35:01] you know you have to suffer and and in
[1:35:04] that way
[1:35:05] they took the wealth of the people
[1:35:08] all went back to the roman church amen
[1:35:12] when most of the time they will go after
[1:35:15] a unique family
[1:35:16] and wealthy family and they will ask for
[1:35:19] the young man to come into the prison
[1:35:21] because everything of the family belongs
[1:35:22] to him
[1:35:23] so what they would do there that now you
[1:35:26] know you're serving god you are seven
[1:35:28] you
[1:35:28] you have to forsake this word you don't
[1:35:30] have nothing in this word
[1:35:32] your inheritance is in heaven so they
[1:35:34] strip out of the wealth
[1:35:37] it goes back to the church so the church
[1:35:40] taught pennies and as and as the ages
[1:35:44] when that that doctrine
[1:35:47] that first was a seed it was a thought
[1:35:51] the days of the nicolaitan that became
[1:35:53] the doctrine of bilaam
[1:35:56] now got into the
[1:35:59] legalistic group
[1:36:02] amen so the legalistic group honored
[1:36:05] that same spirit
[1:36:08] praise the lord talks about i mean we
[1:36:11] can preach and
[1:36:12] and talks about uh you know fornication
[1:36:15] we can talk about our daughter we can
[1:36:16] talk about you know we can just rebuke
[1:36:18] sin
[1:36:19] yeah he says oh the place is hot
[1:36:22] but never bring the people to rest
[1:36:28] so that legalistic spirit gets on the
[1:36:31] trail and just
[1:36:32] whip the people and whip the people and
[1:36:34] with the people
[1:36:36] and just leave them dry
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:40] confused in your mind
[1:36:46] praise the lord
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:49] and then this person is struggling oh
[1:36:51] god i love you i want to serve you
[1:36:53] to try to do everything and and and uh
[1:36:57] uh you know to try to to serve god and
[1:37:00] and i mean one week it looks like
[1:37:03] they're on fire they are moving up and
[1:37:05] and and and then they stumble and made a
[1:37:08] mistake
[1:37:10] and guilt starts to hunt them they are
[1:37:13] so
[1:37:13] troubled feeling guilty oh i've done
[1:37:16] wrong
[1:37:18] because the preacher said i will lose my
[1:37:19] salvation oh my goodness i've done wrong
[1:37:22] then it has to go to go and confess that
[1:37:25] sin to the pastor pastor you know i
[1:37:26] i i don't know how it happened you know
[1:37:28] last week i was really on fire for god
[1:37:30] but you know i made him mistaken and uh
[1:37:33] i was just with some of my friends you
[1:37:35] know uh
[1:37:36] they were drinking i did not drink but i
[1:37:37] just felt guilty that i was there
[1:37:39] yeah the pastor said well then you have
[1:37:43] to stand before the church and let
[1:37:44] everybody know you did wrong
[1:37:46] then you got to go and sit on the center
[1:37:47] bench
[1:37:50] it's that same old devil just enslaving
[1:37:54] the people of god
[1:37:57] they are just laboring in himself
[1:38:01] trying to bring some kind of a sacrifice
[1:38:04] to god
[1:38:05] and never know what is right
[1:38:14] praise the lord but there is a rest
[1:38:18] unto the people of god praise the lord
[1:38:22] there is a rest unto the people of god
[1:38:25] it's now when we get to heaven
[1:38:27] even year on earth god can give us rest
[1:38:33] praise the lord god can give us rest
[1:38:37] by bringing us to a full understanding
[1:38:42] of his work of grace amen
[1:38:45] praise the lord amen
[1:38:50] oh i like the way james uh john said it
[1:38:53] if your heart condemned you yeah there
[1:38:55] is one greater than your heart
[1:39:01] praise the lord you don't have to go do
[1:39:03] penis you have to know there is one that
[1:39:05] is greater than your heart
[1:39:06] and he's your advocate you can go to him
[1:39:10] and he will plead your cause amen
[1:39:15] are we together where am i with all of
[1:39:18] this thing let's travel
[1:39:20] a little bit now so you see this thing
[1:39:23] went on and on and uh
[1:39:25] but it is it is all because because the
[1:39:28] people
[1:39:29] they've met they did not recognize the
[1:39:32] spiritual order that god was bringing
[1:39:34] amen there was a principle why there's a
[1:39:37] purpose why the tabernacle was built
[1:39:40] and they did not recognize that so we
[1:39:42] realized here
[1:39:43] they didn't miss the world with fate
[1:39:45] like like
[1:39:46] uh paul said in hebrew
[1:39:49] and because of that they could not
[1:39:51] possess their inheritance
[1:39:55] praise the lord they could not possess
[1:39:57] their inheritance they came
[1:39:59] in and out of their inheritance from one
[1:40:02] revival to another revival
[1:40:04] they couldn't possess their inheritance
[1:40:07] they
[1:40:08] came in and out of it yeah they enjoy
[1:40:10] his presence and then
[1:40:11] go around oh my goodness you know they
[1:40:14] came in and out
[1:40:15] that's good praise the lord but bam says
[1:40:18] that's the reason why
[1:40:20] paul wrote the letter to the ephesians
[1:40:23] he says the purpose of of
[1:40:26] of of adoption was to settle the sin
[1:40:30] problem amen
[1:40:34] there is nothing that you save today and
[1:40:36] you lost you get your holy ghost today
[1:40:38] and you lost it tomorrow
[1:40:40] it was to bring the people to a place
[1:40:43] of rest
[1:40:46] praise the lord that no matter what
[1:40:49] happens
[1:40:50] around our life god is still in control
[1:40:54] praise the lord amen and even if he
[1:40:57] takes us through different trials in our
[1:41:00] walk with him
[1:41:00] it is just to build character in our
[1:41:02] life
[1:41:04] it's nothing that you you are going to
[1:41:05] hell or you you have done something
[1:41:07] wrong or
[1:41:08] maybe it's a sin that you have committed
[1:41:10] when you were a little child that's the
[1:41:11] reason why god is punishing you no
[1:41:14] amen he's not an evil hunter
[1:41:17] whenever he takes his children through
[1:41:18] triers is to build character
[1:41:22] the purpose of trying is to build
[1:41:24] character
[1:41:25] is to make you a better person
[1:41:32] and if you know that god is building
[1:41:35] character
[1:41:36] it just gives you rest yeah yeah that's
[1:41:38] right nba gives you rest you don't have
[1:41:40] to cry oh god
[1:41:41] i'm sorry i said that 10 years ago oh
[1:41:44] fine forgive me i don't even know which
[1:41:46] which thing now which one
[1:41:47] which one again i have to go back in
[1:41:50] your mind you have to think
[1:41:52] you have to think 10 years ago you have
[1:41:55] to think
[1:42:03] but if you know that god is building
[1:42:05] character
[1:42:07] you say lord you are the potter i am the
[1:42:10] clan
[1:42:12] do unto me i say please because i know
[1:42:15] when you are done
[1:42:16] i'm going to come out better
[1:42:22] oh praise the lord praise the lord
[1:42:26] hallelujah you know that's the re that's
[1:42:29] what brother branham said that was the
[1:42:31] difference between uh
[1:42:33] uh uh moses rod and and jameson jambo's
[1:42:36] raw
[1:42:37] come on amen he said they could throw
[1:42:40] their rod down but they couldn't pick
[1:42:42] it up
[1:42:47] praise the lord they put throw their rod
[1:42:50] down
[1:42:51] but they did not know how to bring it
[1:42:54] back
[1:42:56] the lord and since they didn't know how
[1:42:58] to bring it back
[1:43:00] moses raw would just swallow the arrow
[1:43:05] because he knows how to bring it back
[1:43:08] amen
[1:43:10] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:43:14] hallelujah now so let's go let's travel
[1:43:18] with this thought i was
[1:43:19] just trying to uh you know kind of
[1:43:21] establish us
[1:43:22] that it's a principle it's a principle
[1:43:25] that god used to bring us
[1:43:28] into rest amen
[1:43:32] you can look at it through the three
[1:43:33] stages of grace
[1:43:35] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:43:37] the holy ghost
[1:43:38] but you see he he places there in types
[1:43:41] and shadow
[1:43:43] you look at one of the most beautiful
[1:43:46] redemption stories in the bible
[1:43:48] about this roman rule that came from
[1:43:52] an abominable past
[1:43:55] her past was an abominable past
[1:44:00] she came from the descendant of lord
[1:44:02] sleeping with his daughters
[1:44:06] which of course it was a curse pass god
[1:44:09] condemned under the law he cursed it
[1:44:13] right but yet in
[1:44:16] all of that mess there was a
[1:44:19] predestinated sea
[1:44:20] lion
[1:44:23] praise the lord amen you know what god
[1:44:26] is doing when he brings that to your
[1:44:28] mind
[1:44:28] you don't have to look for nothing in
[1:44:30] your past
[1:44:32] you just have to recognize what god is
[1:44:34] doing today
[1:44:35] what he's doing in your life today
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:43] praise the lord
[1:44:49] anabolic never pass
[1:44:52] being a morbid
[1:44:57] glory to god and we know the story
[1:45:01] but yeri said naomi
[1:45:05] had the desire now to return back
[1:45:10] there was farming in the land and she
[1:45:12] left
[1:45:13] and she's coming right back the time she
[1:45:16] choose to come back
[1:45:18] was in the time of ballad harvest
[1:45:22] in ballet harvest there were different
[1:45:24] harvest times in
[1:45:26] israel there was a ballet harvest and
[1:45:28] there was wheat
[1:45:29] habits all right praise the lord
[1:45:32] and what separated barley harvest from
[1:45:34] wheat harvest was 50 days
[1:45:37] now balad harvest was
[1:45:40] the harvest of the passover
[1:45:44] amen praise the lord amen amen
[1:45:47] ballet harvest was the harvest of the
[1:45:49] passover that's the time of the passover
[1:45:52] and then 50 days from that time
[1:45:55] was wheat harvest which is a type of
[1:45:58] pentecost
[1:46:00] okay amen because uh uh
[1:46:04] the passover was when the lamb was
[1:46:06] killed
[1:46:09] praise the lord so 50 days from there
[1:46:12] was the pentecost
[1:46:16] praise the lord now so she came right in
[1:46:20] that season
[1:46:24] you can see the hand of god all through
[1:46:26] scriptures
[1:46:28] praise the lord all true scriptures you
[1:46:31] can just see the hand of god the timing
[1:46:33] is right
[1:46:34] that's right the timing is right because
[1:46:37] it was right between that that season
[1:46:40] where the dispensation was changed from
[1:46:42] the jewish church to the gentile church
[1:46:46] it was right in that period of time
[1:46:50] between calvary and pentecost
[1:46:57] are we together this is a time where
[1:47:00] naomi decided to return back home
[1:47:04] glory be to god let's go to ruth chapter
[1:47:07] one
[1:47:09] amen let's go to ruth chapter one
[1:47:23] oh praise the lord amen
[1:47:29] glory be to god
[1:47:34] hallelujah
[1:47:49] are we together
[1:48:03] now in rue chapter one
[1:48:07] instead of reading the entire chapter
[1:48:08] i'm trying to grab a place here
[1:48:11] and uh and we see here the scripture
[1:48:14] says
[1:48:16] uh our past have
[1:48:19] have turned her back and she's gone back
[1:48:21] in verse 15 and she said behold that
[1:48:23] sister-in-law has gone
[1:48:25] back onto her people and uh returned
[1:48:28] there that self and and ruth said in
[1:48:31] treatment that
[1:48:32] to leave thee or return from following
[1:48:34] day
[1:48:35] uh uh fall down
[1:48:41] i would go where they are going that
[1:48:43] people would be my people praise the
[1:48:46] lord
[1:48:47] and and your god will be my god she says
[1:48:50] out of that
[1:48:52] praise the lord amen
[1:48:56] there is there's a place that caught my
[1:48:57] attention uh
[1:49:00] when i was reading this chapter that i
[1:49:01] want to bring you to
[1:49:04] uh um praise the lord
[1:49:08] amen now so you see here uh
[1:49:18] when she saw that uh she was steadfast
[1:49:20] in her mind speaking that's verse 18
[1:49:22] verse 19
[1:49:24] and uh
[1:49:33] kind of kind of forgetting uh a reflex
[1:49:37] from what i was reading
[1:49:39] but there was somewhere there here in
[1:49:41] the verse where ru
[1:49:43] naomi originally on a prophecy
[1:49:47] she she spoke about rest
[1:49:50] you know verse nine as you call it my
[1:49:53] eyes just went to it
[1:49:55] and now me verse 8 said unto her two
[1:49:58] daughters-in-law
[1:49:59] go return each to your mother's house
[1:50:03] the lord they count it would be ye have
[1:50:07] there with the dead uh as you have dealt
[1:50:10] with the dead
[1:50:11] and with me the law grant
[1:50:14] you that ye may find
[1:50:17] rest praise the lord amen
[1:50:21] the lord grants you hallelujah
[1:50:25] may find rest
[1:50:28] she prophesied yeah that's right amen
[1:50:32] you have liver with me you've been
[1:50:34] patient with me
[1:50:36] you stood with me now may god bless you
[1:50:40] amen may god bless you that you will
[1:50:44] find rest
[1:50:45] amen
[1:50:48] now go on to your mother's house
[1:50:51] go on and continue with your life praise
[1:50:54] the lord
[1:50:55] but you see there was something about
[1:50:57] ruth
[1:50:59] that we can tie to predestination
[1:51:02] and we can tie to revelation amen praise
[1:51:05] the lord
[1:51:06] because yeri said that she's being
[1:51:08] married into this home
[1:51:10] of a jewish family that they're they're
[1:51:13] pretty soon they started learning the
[1:51:15] laws and they started learning you know
[1:51:16] everything the blessing of abraham and
[1:51:19] all of that
[1:51:20] and there was something that being
[1:51:23] around this home
[1:51:24] she realized that there was a peace of
[1:51:28] mind there was there was something that
[1:51:29] was

[1:53:46] would be my people
[1:53:47] where you go i would go that was rule

[1:53:54] she has to labor
[1:53:57] oh she took her name when she came back
[1:53:59] and you know and
[1:54:01] and everybody call her the morbid

[1:54:29] out to you but here she comes back
[1:54:31] and she gets right into half a season
[1:54:34] she's cleaning

[1:55:21] choice
[1:55:23] the offer was given to her to go back
[1:55:26] but she
[1:55:27] made this choice and because
[1:55:30] it was her choice she has to listen
[1:55:34] to the god of her conviction into what
[1:55:37] people were saying around her
[1:55:38] no matter what they think about her what
[1:55:40] they say about her
[1:55:44] she knew there was something dealing
[1:55:45] with her heart
[1:55:48] praise the lord she couldn't understand

[1:56:47] and she she labor
[1:56:49] she labor right praise the lord

[1:58:34] romans chapter 7
[1:58:36] even if he loved her
[1:58:39] it was just a feeling in his heart

[1:58:46] love of her first husband
[1:58:48] by her widow club and

[2:00:17] where serving god will not just become a
[2:00:19] rude

[2:03:33] tonight
[2:03:38] brother branham said kingsman redeemer
[2:03:40] he says and then ruth was
[2:03:42] asked to do something that was
[2:03:45] disgraceful
[2:03:48] but she was willing because she had made
[2:03:51] a decision
[2:03:53] what a type of the believer
[2:03:57] now i mean the old church said go down
[2:03:59] tonight
[2:04:02] it's balanced season oh
[2:04:05] what a beautiful thought we could hang
[2:04:08] on right there
[2:04:10] now i mean the roof come in just as
[2:04:12] balanced season
[2:04:14] balanced season was bread
[2:04:17] season the season when fresh bread was
[2:04:22] being saved
[2:04:24] and the church in this last day through
[2:04:26] two thousand
[2:04:27] years of pagan teaching and things
[2:04:31] has come in
[2:04:34] at balanced season the freshness of
[2:04:38] life praise the lord you know i
[2:04:42] the last time i was talking umbrella
[2:04:44] rehab scarlet tread
[2:04:46] and i was saying the tear day you know
[2:04:49] is
[2:04:49] is a time of life i mean it's just
[2:04:52] beautiful
[2:04:53] when i see the holy spirit doing it
[2:04:55] yesterday i was listening to brother
[2:04:56] branham
[2:04:57] in a message that i was listening to and
[2:05:00] uh uh was what is that uh hebrew yeah
[2:05:03] i was listening to hebrew chapter 4
[2:05:05] because i was telling hebrew chapter 4.
[2:05:07] and brother branham says he says he said
[2:05:09] do you notice
[2:05:11] that the number three is the number of
[2:05:12] life
[2:05:14] he said it was on the teve
[2:05:17] the life came to the earth
[2:05:21] praise the lord oh my you know
[2:05:25] that just it can just break you apart
[2:05:27] because you know that the holy spirit is
[2:05:29] dealing with you now so you see here
[2:05:33] she sent her to the place washed herself
[2:05:36] anointed
[2:05:37] put that remain upon them and get thee
[2:05:41] down
[2:05:42] to the floor so we see all of these
[2:05:46] stages here
[2:05:48] and we know that's what paul says
[2:05:51] in the book of ephesians when he talks
[2:05:55] about the man ephesians chapter 5 let's
[2:05:58] take that quickly
[2:06:00] i see myself running out of time here
[2:06:02] it's just about time that i should close
[2:06:05] ephesians chapter five and uh uh
[2:06:08] that is uh i mean we are familiar with
[2:06:11] that and paul
[2:06:14] talking
[2:06:17] praise the lord are we together
[2:06:22] amen ephesians chapter 5
[2:06:28] verse 26 okay i'm over a year he says
[2:06:30] hussman love
[2:06:31] your wife even as christ loved the
[2:06:33] church that verse 25
[2:06:35] and gave himself foray that he might
[2:06:38] sanctify
[2:06:39] and cleanse it with the watching of the
[2:06:43] water
[2:06:44] by the word praise the lord
[2:06:48] amen now you will see how
[2:06:51] this the process
[2:06:54] comes from an old testament time
[2:06:58] but yet is is caught up it was plain in
[2:07:02] the scripture
[2:07:03] praise the lord now let me let me show
[2:07:05] you one place there
[2:07:07] uh uh uh oh my goodness
[2:07:10] i mean we we we look at the uh
[2:07:15] second samuel chapter two on wednesday
[2:07:18] night
[2:07:19] or second samuel chapter 12 where the
[2:07:22] david when he came after the little
[2:07:25] child died
[2:07:26] you know david washed himself he annoyed
[2:07:29] himself
[2:07:30] he changed his appearance and the bible
[2:07:33] said he went right into the tabernacle
[2:07:35] and worshiped
[2:07:37] why because he has found rest yes
[2:07:41] praise the lord he knew that it pleased
[2:07:44] the law
[2:07:45] to take the child and not only that
[2:07:49] but david also knew that he was forgiven
[2:07:54] that's the reason why he could wake up
[2:07:56] change his clothes
[2:07:58] anoint himself and everybody asking
[2:08:01] what's wrong
[2:08:03] at the time the child was sick you were
[2:08:04] fasting and praying now the child died
[2:08:06] it just looks like
[2:08:07] no no no all that time he was spending
[2:08:09] before god
[2:08:14] he was pouring his heart out to god
[2:08:18] he was looking for rest
[2:08:21] praise the lord he was looking for rest
[2:08:25] the lord if you spare the life of this
[2:08:27] child
[2:08:28] may i find rest not to look at him and
[2:08:31] feel guilty
[2:08:32] all the time praise the lord
[2:08:36] because sometimes people connect
[2:08:38] children to
[2:08:39] to their thoughts
[2:08:45] and when things start happening in your
[2:08:46] life then look at that child okay that
[2:08:48] this child was born at the time this
[2:08:50] thing happened to me
[2:08:52] so david was at a place where
[2:08:56] he wanted rest in his heart no matter
[2:08:58] law what
[2:08:59] whatever is the decision whatever
[2:09:01] happens here if you spare the life of
[2:09:03] this child let me be able to live with
[2:09:05] him and be
[2:09:06] happy amen
[2:09:09] if you also take him away let me also be
[2:09:12] able to live and be
[2:09:14] happy
[2:09:17] that is when god and man pour his heart
[2:09:20] before god
[2:09:22] and say come into my heart lord
[2:09:26] whatever is the result let me get it
[2:09:28] from my knees
[2:09:30] and be happy praise the lord
[2:09:33] because you see that's that's the way
[2:09:35] the devil works he
[2:09:36] always strives to look for something
[2:09:38] where he can tie your memory talk
[2:09:42] he can be able to bring you back tone
[2:09:45] and he will use that
[2:09:48] to draw you back into condemnation
[2:09:52] to be able to draw you back into shame
[2:09:55] yeah
[2:09:56] praise the lord that's why the holy
[2:09:59] ghost is important
[2:10:01] that's why experiencing forgiveness
[2:10:05] not just as a word but for giving us
[2:10:09] us the freedom from guilt amen
[2:10:14] praise the lord when a man is free from
[2:10:16] guilt
[2:10:17] he don't struggle to talk about his past
[2:10:20] because he does not hurt him
[2:10:24] it does not hurt him there is nothing
[2:10:25] there hurting his repetition is not tied
[2:10:28] to thy past
[2:10:34] oh glory be to god hallelujah
[2:10:39] amen praise the lord
[2:10:43] let's close this up here so you see paul
[2:10:46] brings this
[2:10:47] in he puts the husband to the place
[2:10:50] now watching the church by the water of
[2:10:54] the world
[2:10:55] now you will see in the scripture how
[2:10:57] beautiful it plays
[2:10:58] out here in the ministry of jesus
[2:11:03] praise the lord because we see
[2:11:06] in in in the new testament church
[2:11:10] we realize that there
[2:11:13] are there are two places in the
[2:11:15] scripture
[2:11:17] the bible talks there in luke chapter
[2:11:19] seven
[2:11:21] where the bible talks about a woman
[2:11:24] praise the lord in simon house
[2:11:28] and brother branham said this woman
[2:11:31] was not living a good life
[2:11:36] but here it said yeah she realized that
[2:11:39] jesus
[2:11:40] was brought to simon house and then no
[2:11:43] sense of welcome
[2:11:46] they never wash his feet they never
[2:11:49] anoint him
[2:11:52] praise the lord amen see the paradox
[2:11:55] here
[2:11:57] ruth told her daughter in lord wash that
[2:12:00] self
[2:12:02] and annoy that self but in this story
[2:12:06] this woman is watching jesus feet
[2:12:10] and she's anointing jesus
[2:12:13] little did she know that she was doing
[2:12:15] it to herself
[2:12:18] little did she know that watching his
[2:12:22] feet
[2:12:23] weapon with her head and taking that
[2:12:25] expensive other batch of oil
[2:12:28] to anoint him neither did she know
[2:12:34] right that she was doing it to herself
[2:12:38] because he's a woman
[2:12:41] your clothes is changed
[2:12:47] your clothes has changed
[2:12:51] woman that are forgiving yes sir
[2:12:57] you see why paul in the scripture says
[2:13:00] do your service as unto the lord
[2:13:03] and don't look for man's don't be an eye
[2:13:06] pleaser
[2:13:08] whatever you would do let it be like
[2:13:10] unto the
[2:13:12] [Applause]
[2:13:14] glory lord god amen
[2:13:18] praise the lord
[2:13:22] she got there and she broke down in one
[2:13:25] message brother branham says god
[2:13:27] brought the fountain of her tears glands
[2:13:31] for her to have enough tears to wash his
[2:13:34] feet
[2:13:40] he broke the fountain of her tears
[2:13:43] glance
[2:13:47] and she cried and she cried
[2:13:50] yeah have you ever experienced that
[2:13:55] i can say to you the night i received
[2:13:57] the holy ghost that's what happened to
[2:13:58] me
[2:13:59] i didn't know what happened i cried i
[2:14:02] cried
[2:14:03] i cried everything i think about i cried
[2:14:05] i think about my mother i cried
[2:14:07] i think about my life i cried
[2:14:12] it was many years ago one old preacher
[2:14:14] told me and he said son
[2:14:15] that was a sign of the holy ghost
[2:14:21] i cried the whole night until morning
[2:14:27] and i was walking in the place and the
[2:14:30] boss
[2:14:32] asked me i i needed i was sleeping at
[2:14:34] work and he asked me
[2:14:36] he says what's happened he thought that
[2:14:40] maybe i heard a news that
[2:14:41] i've lost one of my parents or something
[2:14:44] he said i heard somebody sobbing all
[2:14:46] through the night
[2:14:47] i said well i'm sorry i was the one
[2:14:51] i couldn't tell what was happening but i
[2:14:53] just cried
[2:14:56] i cried i never cried for the law firm
[2:14:59] like that
[2:15:02] but god broke yeah her tears glanced
[2:15:09] and she could cry enough tears to wash
[2:15:12] his feet
[2:15:14] praise the lord
[2:15:20] and she was doing that unto the lord
[2:15:24] but since everybody knew her repetition
[2:15:27] even simon said on the stool if he was
[2:15:29] really the man of god he would know that
[2:15:30] woman is a sinner
[2:15:32] because we know her we know her life
[2:15:36] she was doing it unto the lord but
[2:15:39] little did she
[2:15:40] know jesus
[2:15:44] is woman thy sin is forgiving thee
[2:15:50] it's it's it's it's a it's a it's an
[2:15:52] immediate action
[2:15:54] it's a word of the master that separates
[2:15:57] you from your past
[2:16:00] amen praise the lord
[2:16:05] it's a word from almighty god
[2:16:10] that cut the umbilical cord of sin from
[2:16:13] your life
[2:16:20] that's what the holy ghost does that's
[2:16:22] what the power of god does it cut
[2:16:25] that call of the same nature
[2:16:29] praise the lord all the things you
[2:16:32] struggle with
[2:16:33] they are just memory yeah but the desire
[2:16:37] is gone
[2:16:41] the devil gave you flashback he gave you
[2:16:43] flashback
[2:16:44] but the desire is gone
[2:16:48] oh i challenge you to try to go back you
[2:16:51] will just look stupid
[2:16:56] praise the lord you will just look
[2:16:59] stupid
[2:17:00] put a cigarette in your hands you don't
[2:17:02] know what to do with it
[2:17:04] you will use it and start writing insane
[2:17:07] before you used to keep it at the corner
[2:17:09] of your mouth but you would just take it
[2:17:11] and start writing this
[2:17:16] so you see it is the husband that watch
[2:17:21] every time we praise him after the
[2:17:23] preaching of the world
[2:17:25] every time we lift our hands
[2:17:29] we are watching his feet and he in
[2:17:32] return he's anointing
[2:17:34] us
[2:17:37] praise the lord
[2:17:45] oh i love the lord jesus
[2:17:49] i love the lord jesus
[2:17:52] glory be to god amen
[2:17:59] and it's through the scripture it was a
[2:18:02] principle of redemption
[2:18:05] that's why the preaching of the word
[2:18:07] that's the reason why this man had to be
[2:18:09] watched
[2:18:10] why because there was one principal
[2:18:13] watch that was done
[2:18:15] in the scripture one principle watch
[2:18:20] now when the worshipers come to the
[2:18:22] tabernacle
[2:18:23] all they had to do was just to go to
[2:18:26] the lava and wash the dust
[2:18:30] off their feet but there is one
[2:18:32] principal watch
[2:18:34] that the holy ghost does
[2:18:38] he gave you a good sub
[2:18:41] bath watch in the bathtub
[2:18:45] he touched you from your head
[2:18:49] to the sword of your feet and then after
[2:18:52] that watch
[2:18:54] all you need is just a watch out the
[2:18:56] lava
[2:18:58] [Laughter]
[2:19:01] praise the lord oh my
[2:19:05] glory be to god but when a person has
[2:19:07] not experienced
[2:19:08] the entire body watch
[2:19:12] nature change desire change
[2:19:16] amen if you experience that come on
[2:19:21] very branham said you will not wait
[2:19:23] until the door open
[2:19:25] you want to be to the house of god
[2:19:27] because you have already experienced an
[2:19:29] entire body watch so whenever everything
[2:19:32] is seek on your feet you want to be in
[2:19:34] the presence of god and wash it out
[2:19:35] quickly
[2:19:36] because you already have your entire
[2:19:38] body watched
[2:19:41] that's why jesus told peter
[2:19:44] he that his fetus watch
[2:19:48] not his whole body because you have
[2:19:50] already got a body watch
[2:19:53] he says you are cleansed by the words
[2:19:55] that i have spoken to you amen
[2:20:03] that's the reason why the the the
[2:20:05] believers run to the house of god
[2:20:07] amen they can't stay away from
[2:20:10] fellowship
[2:20:11] because they have got an entire body
[2:20:13] watch yes
[2:20:16] as we go along we rub arms with the word
[2:20:19] by the things we hear people saying the
[2:20:21] things that are all on the street
[2:20:23] and then quickly we run into his
[2:20:26] presence amen
[2:20:27] praise the lord amen
[2:20:30] right in leviticus that's what it was
[2:20:33] they had to wash their hands wash their
[2:20:34] feet
[2:20:35] porter put a a
[2:20:38] a part of the blood sacrifice on the ear
[2:20:40] for what they were here
[2:20:42] on their big tongue for what they will
[2:20:43] handle and on their big toes for all the
[2:20:45] places they will go
[2:20:52] and the scripture says we are priests
[2:20:54] and kings
[2:20:55] amen onto our god so when we come to the
[2:20:59] lord he gave
[2:20:59] us that top watch i don't know how yours
[2:21:03] was
[2:21:04] my goodness but when he got to my back
[2:21:07] he really scrubbed it
[2:21:08] [Laughter]
[2:21:11] because all the good things you try to
[2:21:14] do
[2:21:15] your hands can get to your back
[2:21:21] you can put the face you can do all of
[2:21:23] that but when he gets to your back
[2:21:26] he knows that's where all the dirt is
[2:21:28] settled
[2:21:29] so he's give you a good bath wash
[2:21:32] [Laughter]
[2:21:37] oh my goodness but that's the way that
[2:21:40] god brings his people to rest
[2:21:45] he brings you to rest that way
[2:21:51] come why me
[2:21:55] rain or sunshine snow or heat
[2:22:00] there is just something
[2:22:04] that a child of god always want to be in
[2:22:07] the presence of the lord
[2:22:10] musicians you can come praise the lord
[2:22:14] the lord help us will continue on the
[2:22:20] top
[2:22:28] there's a rest onto the people of god
[2:22:34] young people as you come
[2:22:37] said played instruments
[2:22:44] come to church on wednesday night see a
[2:22:50] lot of our young people
[2:22:51] try to work up their schedule
[2:22:55] to make sure they will be in church what
[2:22:56] is making you to do that
[2:22:59] is it just to hang up with your friends
[2:23:01] on wednesday night
[2:23:07] something is just moving your heart

[2:23:37] going to bring your family to rest
[2:23:39] as a young man
[2:23:43] as a young woman

[2:26:55] thank you lord
[2:26:56] [Music]
[2:26:59] oh jesus
[2:27:16] see with many of the people around the
[2:27:17] message that are beginning to struggle
[2:27:20] with things
[2:27:21] [Music]
[2:27:23] is because preachers have promised them
[2:27:27] and those promises are not coming to
[2:27:29] pass
[2:27:30] people have built false
[2:27:34] expectations they have filled their
[2:27:37] minds
[2:27:38] with self-made vindication
[2:27:42] and because things are not happening
[2:27:46] so they say well there is nothing to
[2:27:47] date
[2:27:49] oh we thought he would come in 77 we
[2:27:52] have gone 40 years the rapture has not
[2:27:54] come
[2:27:55] brother branham said the bride will be
[2:27:57] able to speak their loved ones
[2:27:59] back to faith and all of these
[2:28:03] falls people of god let me tell you i've
[2:28:06] said this here before
[2:28:09] god has given us one of the greatest
[2:28:11] ministry
[2:28:13] and because of the level of brother
[2:28:15] branham ministry
[2:28:17] many people term to be impersonators
[2:28:19] [Music]
[2:28:21] because the thing they can rise to that
[2:28:23] same place
[2:28:24] i told my brother in a week we were
[2:28:26] talking and you were saying something to
[2:28:28] me
[2:28:29] i told him i said brother i'm not
[2:28:30] looking for personal vindication
[2:28:33] i believe a vindicated word and that's
[2:28:35] enough for me
[2:28:37] god has vindicated his word as long
[2:28:40] as i become submissive to this word and
[2:28:43] lift the word
[2:28:44] up and left jesus higher i'm not looking
[2:28:47] for no question of dedication
[2:28:51] i'm following the vindicator word
[2:28:55] i'm not here to preach to plaintiff you
[2:28:57] in my heart
[2:28:58] or plains plant myself in your heart
[2:29:02] no
[2:29:05] some people just labor
[2:29:08] to blame themselves in the hearts of the
[2:29:10] people
[2:29:12] so the people will not leave
[2:29:13] [Music]
[2:29:17] there is one responsibility that i have
[2:29:20] is to bring out what god has put in you
[2:29:23] it's not to put myself there but to say
[2:29:26] there's a seed of god that was put in
[2:29:29] your heart from the foundation of the
[2:29:31] world
[2:29:34] and to create an atmosphere that you as
[2:29:37] a child of god
[2:29:38] will be will begin to start surrounding
[2:29:41] you will start yelling to that thing in
[2:29:43] your life
[2:29:45] you will start surrounding you will
[2:29:47] start giving yourself
[2:29:49] i'm not here to beg you to come to
[2:29:51] church

[2:29:57] pray for you encourage you check on you
