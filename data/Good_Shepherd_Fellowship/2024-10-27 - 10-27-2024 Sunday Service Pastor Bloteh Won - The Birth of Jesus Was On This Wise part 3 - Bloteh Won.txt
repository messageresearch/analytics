relate to it we we are all born with the spirit of fear it comes by our natural birth praise the Lord amen it comes by our natural birth being born in the words uh uh coming into the word speaking lies there are some of the things we inherit and uh but then to come to the place and realize that God has delivered us amen amen and we we thank God we thank God the Lord bless you the Lord bless you thank you musicians and thank God for the spirit of worship this morning uh you may have your seat as we once again want to greet you again in the name of the Lord Jesus and it's good to see the grace of God on your faces praise the Lord amen amen it's good to see God's grace on your faces this morning and uh we so happy to be in the house of the Lord praise the Lord I was planning to you that we were going to have a um a church meeting and uh uh I told Brother Jordan to schedule there but I thought well I will we will that we will plan for it sometime next year if the Lord will allow us uh um and then U but we want to thank the lord we want to thank the Lord for the opportunity that he has given us to uh to come together and uh the grace that he has put on this place that we can and uh we still have the doors open we still have the opportunity to gather in the house of the Lord amen if you are listening to the to the news you are listening to the the report uh uh around the world you realize that uh the word is on fire praise the Lord a lot of things that are happening in every word amen and uh I didn't see the uh and then uh visitor here but I recognize a visitor there so God bless you oh she said she been here before okay so you are welcome okay praise the Lord amen you know uh uh our space is so small so when I stand here I can just pick you up by looking at your faces amen and we see everything that is happening around the world you know when we talk about this it's not it's not uh we have just sang the song I'm no longer a slave to fear it's not to make you afraid it's just to tell you that we have been told amen these things like Paul says it does not take the Believer by surprise amen it does not take the Believer by surprise we have been taught and we are slowly coming to the things things that the prophets prophesied about the things that the Bible spoke about and what a privileged people that we can see those things happening right before our eyes praise the Lord and uh uh and to to every believing son and daughter of God we realize that uh uh uh it cannot be said more and more that uh this is homegoing time amen this is homegoing time and until that time uh we must be be able to do the best that we can like I said uh last week or on Wednesday night uh uh this is this is the manifestation I mean whatever we are doing now it is our manifestation amen the Bible talk about the creation groining for the manifestation of the sons of God whatever we are doing now uh uh I know we looking for uh speaking uh missing links back and and uh you know uh uh speaking to the weather and all of that uh uh no doubt God will bring us uh into uh uh a place of uh uh uh a quick short work but I mean I I I Fe in my heart we are right into that I mean that's what is happening right now you must be able to speak to your storm you must be able to speak to your situation praise the Lord you know don't wait for the clouds to be gathering out there that's why Jesus told the Pharisees you can tell the sign when the clouds are gathering but the sign of your day you cannot recognize it praise the Lord so with the grace that God have given us the word and the way he's dealing with us we must be able you know to be able to take this word of God out of the pages of the Bible and bring it into manifestation praise the Lord you know so uh just thinking about those things and some of the things that I just wanted to to uh uh talk about if we have had a time to to gather together once again is to be able to appreciate every every family every brother sister husband wife they have making this place uh you call this place home church we appreciate you for all uh your your support amen and uh we we want to thank you for everything that you are doing to make this church better amen because I will tell you there is no one that is coming from anywhere that will make this church better than the people that come here praise the lord it's our responsibility to make it better it's our responsibility to keep it clean it's our responsibility praise the Lord amen and uh you know I thinking about all of this this morning I thought about uh uh uh if God did not if the angel did not visit Zacharias we will know little or nothing about the service that he did the Bible says Zacharias had this ministry where he he was the one that burned incense he come and he prepare the place before the worshippers come in he come he take the incense and he blow it all through the Tabernacle or the temple whatever they were gathering in that was the work that he was doing and it was it was a kind of a uh backstage work you know and and uh uh people will see the the the priest that would say the prayer the one that would read the STP the ones that would do the different things that were done but this man he had to come ear it and the Bible say he was a just man he was a righteous man and he was faithful at what he was doing praise the Lord and thinking about that this morning and uh uh if if you remember I've been trying to go over this and and you know and and kind of encourage us you know because if if we had that in uh in the New Testament Church if we had uh uh something in the New Testament Church where we had you know uh an incent Veil out there for somebody to do it I believe with without no doubt many of us might have think okay I mean if it is just open to anybody that come early to take their incense I'll try to come early and and you know and just bring incense you know that's that's the thing about us humans there are there are things like we like to touch things you know we we like to feel it you know we like to see it with our eyes but you see that uh that's not the way that God deal with us when it comes to spiritual things amen he want us to be able to see things by the eyes of Faith be able to touch it by the feelings of Faith amen praise the Lord the Lord hallelujah and uh uh uh so uh but that thing has been brought to us in this last day by the prophet when he tells us that when we come before the doors open and you come into the the the the the place of worship he says you are doing just like Zacharias you are burning incense When you pray before the service begin you know uh and like I said before it's a Ministry you know it's a Ministry you are called to do it it's one of those things that you know that does not have a big title in the Bible because uh or in in you know in in Christendom because it is some of those things just like the engine you can see the outside frame of the vehicle and you like it or you like how the back is you like how you know the tires are you like how the doors are but none of those things move the vehicle than the engine praise the Lord the engine is covered the engine is in in the back room or in the front room wherever it is uh uh it's it's covered you don't see it praise the Lord and I believe many of us drive our car we never see the engine we don't open it every morning and says you know my oil cap is on you know until it start breaking down praise the Lord but everything that moved that vehicle is right in that little compartment the spot plugs and everything is right in that little compartment and everything that move this church is on our knees the engine room of the church is the prayer room praise the Lord amen prayer room is the engine room of the church and I say there to encourage you and also to appreciate the ones that come early and open the doors and turn turn the sound on you know and wait for us to come and you know sit down and and listening to the tipe that is playing you know this is our we choose to do that you know to to play the tape and many of the brothers too that come around they appreciate that you know uh uh that we can be listening to something that prepared our mind to go into the service and these things there you know it's is there online you know we uh uh the the the technician there you know play it and it's playing online you can play it while you drive to church you know and and uh it's it's all part of that that's what we've been using since we came back from CO as I or Sunday school and uh and and there's a reason why we do that you know uh uh uh maybe one of these days we'll take time and and be able to really explain ourself on that but you know we we just we just appreciate that you know and and and even those that are able to make it Wednesday night you know uh that we can be able to have a Wednesday service and we also want to thank you you know we want to thank you uh um we know the business of our time that's that's the last day Spirit you can't get it any better than that it's not going to be any better it's going to get more busy and more busy and more busy and more busy praise the Lord but yet we want to thank God that he have got the got our hearts amen that in all the busyness he can pull us aside whether we are at home or we are at work wherever we are he can be able to deal with our hearts he can be able to speak something to our hearts something that can grab our attention as we as we as like just like I said you know um uh uh Bop North Koreans over in Russia we don't know what what that is going to produce and uh uh Israel is stricking Iran we don't know what that is going to produce just couple of weeks ago we have had our share with lot of flaws down in the South all of these are birth pains praise the Lord all of these are birth pains don't live your life not paying attention to the things that are happening around you even in this city Minneapolis every other week like I said on Wednesday night there is an increase of juvenile crime in the city what is happening now you having bunch of warock that are using little children because they know that children from 12 10 years old they will not go to prison so they are using those little ones now to start robbing cars stealing cars and all of that right here in this city a little three years old took a gun and shoot himself dead right here in this city it don't have to be in our house before we know it's happening the Lord promis it might not come n us that does not mean that it's not happening it's happening but in the midst of it all we thank the Lord he's faithful amen the Lord is faithful we just uh appreciate the Lord Lord we want to thank the Lord for uh the musicians the technicians and uh the deacons the trustees praise the Lord that um that are helping us around here we are very very grateful we are very very grateful amen and if Jesus T it we will the church will keep mashing on amen amen Jesus T the church will keep mashing on my more concern and burden is for our children the younger ones that are coming up if we are dealing with all of this what will be their time what are the things that are they going to deal with if we don't give them uh an example if we don't Aspire their hearts to go after God and learn to you know sit in church and and and pay attention and listening to the word and and and be able to get something from out of the service if we don't you know uh uh uh uh What uh what what a future that await them praise the Lord what the future that await them man uh uh a couple of months back we had few black seats right there and uh uh I said I was going to use that to to help the Young on sit down independently and pay attention and then it started changing to different things so I said well okay I'm just going to to make this seat all you know and and uh because I mean it was just it was just an exercise we were trying it was not something that was going to be pinent and uh because uh one of the thing there we as parents is is our responsibility you know I know what it is when you sit there and you realize that your child is not you know doing things it make you feel unease and uh you know if you want them to sit by your side that that's that's okay also you know but uh uh we're living in such a Time praise the Lord ah we're living in such a time you know as hmons you know sometimes we get we get uh uh comfortable in a certain place I was thinking about that this morning also you know Wednesday night I have asked the deacons uh since uh uh we are now normally four like this on Wednesday night I wish we can be but uh uh we look for the Lord to bring us to that place I ask the deacons to spread us around a little bit you know so uh we cannot have a one-sided Church you know we can where people can be spread about a little bit you know uh uh uh uh so uh the preacher cannot be uh Twisted in the way that he's looking and uh and and I know some of some some uh uh feel a little bit uncomfortable when you move from your normal area of s you know but uh uh uh just think about it why if you just think one of these morning you know I've been sitting on this side what what is it if I sit on the other side you know how does it feel like you know just just to be able to get that feeling and that Liberty and uh you know praise the Lord amen but enjoy the comfort of your seity amen enjoy the comfort of your seat and uh uh praise the Lord if the if the deacons move you on Wednesday night so just understand that's the reason why because everybody sit left I'm going to be looking and here and the other people think that why he just looking there he's not looking this way praise the Lord but uh we are very grateful we are very grateful uh uh this assembly has come come a long way and yet we have a long way to go amen many people have come through through our gates and and are gone and uh uh but but uh we are here some uh uh the the future of this assembly and we just we just pray that God God will be able to help us we have have some of our tough year and some of the tough things that we have to deal with but the Lord has been faithful amen the Lord has been faithful so we just we just thank the Lord for that we just thank the Lord for that I promise you I was going to go back to uh uh my message on U uh the breath of Jesus was on this why so I want to go back to there this morning so if the Lord will give us Grace uh I pray and that he will be able to help us this morning let's stand on our feet and we can be able to take it from you let's stand on our feet and we can be able to take it from you praise the Lord amen let's stand on our feet by the grace of God this morning we read Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 I'm just going to read a part A of that and then also uh Luke chapter 1 verse 35 and then you will have your seat and then we will be able to go into what we want to share with you this morning if you remember the last time I spoke on this we read from Ezekiel uh through chapter 14 and 15 and 16 I was actually wanted to speak on 16 that night but I went to chapter 14 and then uh took most of the time on it so uh today we will go to chapter 16 but let's read Matthew chapter 1 Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 praise the Lord amen and also that we were going to have that uh church meeting we were going to be talking about uh future plans and uh uh because if the Lord Jesus started I'm looking looking forward that he will be able to bless us uh uh to have a better space you know and uh if we if he can be able to bless us and we work together and build a church we all will be proud of it amen we all will be proud of it you know it's it's a memorial God told the children of Israel you got a 12 Stones plant it right in Jordan and then take 12 Stones and plant it out of Jordan and then you can turn back and point to it and tell your children you see those stones in Jordan you know you see the rare one your grandfather put it there praise the lord it's always a good thing if we can if we can be able to build a memorial to the Lord and the greatest Memorial that we can build to God is the life that we live amen Matthew chapter what did I say 118 okay sorry because I'm in chapter 18 instead of chapter 1 verse 18 let's read chapter 1 verse 18 and uh uh the part eight of that now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when his mother married was exposed to Joseph before they came together she was form with child of the Holy Ghost Luke 1 verse 35 Luke is going to testify of the same thing Matthew say she was filled with the Holy Ghost Luke is going to tell us she was overshadowed with the Holy Ghost let's read Luke account chapter 1 verse 35 Luke 1:35 and the angel answered and said unto her the angel speaking to Mary the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God let's pray father we have read two verses from the Bible this morning and we want to ask your blessing upon it Lord Jesus as we speak this morning come out of the pages of your word let something be said that will encourage us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat we have a little more reading to do but uh uh uh I just want to do a little review before we get into uh uh a little more reading that we want to do um what thing year of Christ that's where we took the inspiration speaking on this what thing year of Christ and we read that to you but BR said I said that's a good thing that's just a good thing to talk about I said you ever get the Virgin birth the Virgin birth straightened out you got Christianity straighten out amen if you get the virgin birth straighten out you get Christianity straighten out and where are we going with this thought where are we laboring where we want to get your mind to that the Virgin birth was no human no human no human contributed to the Virgin birth amen it was God it was God that promised that the woman that will have a seed the god that promised the Virgin shall conceive he's that same God that took his word and was able to form a child in the womb of Mary so where are we going with this if we can get that straighten out that God uses men amen but he is the power he is the inspiration he is the one that comes down and use this man if we can understand it that way brother brand said we will get Christianity straighten out we having so much human ability in the picture because a man fa a preacher fall into sin so we no longer want to serve God we don't believe you know uh uh you know God how could that happen we get so much human element in it that is the thing that is behind this thought if we can get that straightened out in our mind our Christian life will be straightened out see what he says here also another beautiful one he says God ways God's way made for us they deny the Virgin birth not only that but a service shows that 85% of the Protestant preachers in the United States claim that the Virgin birth was a fake right I could easily do that I could I could easy think think that by the way you live it praise the Lord you could say you believe in the Virgin birth but your life don't prove it you could say you believe in the Rapture and you are living far from someone that is getting ready for the Rapture so what what what is it all about your profession when your life does not show it praise the Lord amen so what what he's trying to point us here is that this preacher says that the Virgin birth is fake why because if the Virgin birth a God had to bring himself down through human instrumentality why are we indulging sin in the church praise the Lord why will God give his own life if we will not be able to encourage ourself to live right and live above the reproach of sin so you don't believe the Virgin birth you believe the theor about it you believe the storyed about it but you don't believe the effect of the Virgin birth that's what he's saying are we together praise the Lord so that's that's where we we we trying to labor with this to be able to see that uh uh uh just like God met an ordinary woman an ordinary girl going on with her ordinary life God met her and brought this promise of Isaiah to her Behold a virgin shall conceive that is the same where God met you in your ordinary condition going on with your ordinary life and he brought his word to grab your attention and if God could form a child in the womb of Merit without no human sensation he's doing the same in the bride praise the Lord amen beyond your doubt beyond your fears beyond your weakness the god that has called you amen honor the promise to present himself a church without spot or wrinkle praise the Lord the god that have called you amen under the promise you are called on the promise that he made to himself that he he will present himself a church without spot or wrinkle thaty God that made that promise and he call you to that promise beyond your weakness he's able to bring that promise to pass praise the Lord that's where we want to bring you out that's where we trying to labor because we get our mind we get ourselves so much in it oh this is my weakness oh yeah this thing this you know that's my family problem oh yeah we get so much of ourself in it that is hard for us to believe that God can bring his promise in our life without our abilities that's the God we Ser amen praise the Lord yes the kind of a God we Ser blessed be the name of the Lord and that's where we want to labor this morning are you ready to labor with me amen hallelujah are you ready to labor with me that God is more than able amen beyond all my failures God is more than able praise the Lord to bring a virgin word to me and and and create a life in me that's what we want to labor this morning but before we do that I came across a little video a news uh out of Chicago and uh I kind of uh just grab a little thing there it's it's under my inspiration so I will ask uh uh the tech people to play there for us this morning it's just a few few seconds uh uh um few second a couple of minutes uh video if you can cut this light off or Dam it you want to take it back to the beginning old left in a dumpster to die happened to a man you're about to meet 41 years ago when laws existed that was a mistake that needed to be erased his name is Shawn but he came into this world as John Winter's doe his first hours were spent dying in a dirty dumpster like this that I was somebody's unwanted garbage it was 1983 in Arlington Heights where this young couple Bruce and Terry McDonald heard a strange purring noise coming from the trash sounds like a cat I'll help it out and then I you know you look over the top of the the dumpster and you don't expect to see a baby with an umbilical cord attached to him and so I brought him to my to my chest it was 50° outside and his cries were strained so the couple called for an ambulance he was very very fortunate because he wouldn't have been able to cry for very much longer because of his hypothermia they said you saved his life this is where the dumpster was yeah this was where I was found 41 years later Shawn returns to where his life nearly ended Monday would have been garbage day it was full so you're on the top and smelly coming up here I remember very tiny very small Glen Ericson was one of the first paramedics on the scene that's him in the Daily Herald carrying Shawn to the hospital I'm looking at you How could somebody do that you know to a to a child that old left in a dumpster to die happened to a man you're about to meet praise the Lord amen Ezekiel chapter 8 16 let's read Ezekiel chapter 16 praise the Lord amen Ezekiel chapter 16 again

thee when thou were in that blood live praise the Lord I said unto thee when thou were in thy blood live this is almost like Jesus saying verily verily you know making emphasis amen even though you were cast out just think about that that little baby see how grown he is now amen and those couples just taking a stroll that they were not planning to adopt a baby they were not planning to go into the garbage they are not working with a garbage company they were just taking a stro and he says he hear a a a a a squeaking sound of a child he thought it was a little cat just to look over and see a

was in thy blood life I have caused thee to multiplied as The Bu of the field and thou have increased and waxing great and thou are come to exceeding ornament thy breast are faction th head is grown whereas thou were naked and bad praise the Lord amen you think about it after how many years visiting the very scene to go back to the very trash scene where they took him from can you imagine what what would go through his mind the next day was trash day and when the trash truck comes they don't go looking and say what kind of trash is here it's all trash it's garbage praise the Lord don't

I anoint thee with oil I clothe thee also with brother work amen and show thee with beggar skin and gther thee about fine lining and cover thee with silk praise the Lord amen oh my God may the Lord help us this morning listen listen to what brother Bram says adoption message he says he says oh we are just we are living in a dumb part down here he says this life on Earth no matter where state of life you are in Praise the Lord you might not be on the most SW smelling part of the dump part P you might just be on the better side but it's all a dump praise the Lord amen I was trying to look for some images this morning but I just did not want it to crowd your mind after playing this video then just show you people that are searching into Dum part and you know looking for treasure you know and and uh and and sometimes the the find things that work and sometimes that's just what it is it can be an education you find it in the dumper it can be a business you find it right in this dumper it can be a career you dig you dig you dig you just find it it worth value but you took it right from this dumper of sin he said we are living in a dump power down here that's all just a rubbish Heap a Smalling smoke of f even if we are not contaminated with it ourself we are living in it look at the word look at the things that are happening around us can you smell it the indecency that is corrupting the minds of our youth children as young not even 10 years old their minds have been diverging their B abuse even if we are not contaminated with it ourself we are living in it where the smoke is coming from smok it Amber of sin one of the most sickening thing I can think of is an old city Dum burning was you ever near one that's horrible contaminated smell of smoke coming up through all kinds of fil and you get a breath of it and it's just turn you around praise the Lord I remember having to go down to new abenue below aen Street there where the old Dum used to be and I did have to collect down in there and read meters and I just dread the day that the the day when that was Route 18 when I had to take that down there because it was a smell that horrible smell and yet laying out on there was bodies of rats and dogs and everything you know that was the smothering and that old smoke coming up through it now yet that is what this life is compared to at its best life at its best in all that we can get out of it you just got a treasure from the dump because it stay right here it perish with you just a treasure from the dumped because Paul said eyes have not seen ears have not heard neither have it come close to our heart for what wa for us on the other side there is nothing in this life that can be compared to it that's all we doing we're just searching in the dump looking for Treasure it might be bringing some amusement to you it might satisfy you for the why but you took it from the dump and it will become a dump after you drop it and that's what this life is compared to at its best just a smothering sin just smell every word as it was spiritually speaking so you think about it when we were birth in this word we were just like that man we were birth in the dump prophet of God says every birth is a mess we were birth right in the dumb in in this dumb word an innocent child lying dead we must be grateful that we have father and mother that were close that could comfort us that could hold us in a Warmness of their arm his owner parents thrw him there and left him your owner parents St with you in the dump to bring you some sense of comfort and we think that we have achieved we think that we're so smart we have learned we can educate them we can check them up we can say things to them may God be merciful and help us to realize that we are just in a part of dump sometimes in a dump you find things that were never used stay in the package they were never used amen that is some of our brand new things we are buying is in the dump and God is is grabing in the mind of Jerusalem and and and trying to let them know where I took you from you came from a hidden land your father was an Amorite it was right in that land I met Abraham you are like a child that was left in a dump to die but when I pass by I say live praise the Lord just like the woman said I pick him up I put him to my chest what did she say live you're not going to die quickly they call the ambulance he said when I passed by and saw you there I said live and again I say live praise the Lord sometimes we get so Twisted in our mind and we think that you know that uh we forget that we are depending on him we forget that our dependency is on him we think that we have got so much Independence to be what we want to be and to do what we want to do praise the Lord amen we have been able to save up little money we can buy whatever we want to buy we can go wherever we want to go pretty much we now we think that now the role is reversed instead of depending on him we want him to depend on Us Praise the Lord I'm telling you if you don't show up God will raise up Stones that's what he said he will raise up Stones praise the Lord he will raise up Stones glory be to God it says I found you lying there in your own blood and when I pass I say live I never only say live I prophesy over you but then I went down and I pick you up out of your own blood he says I wash you I address you I anoint you praise the Lord oh may God just help us this morning amen glory be to God hallelujah he says and I brought you to myself I put an ornament on you I saw you growing up like a young lady that is good it's good when you go home and you just read all of this chapter you will see what what is lying there God says and then I I I spread my skirt over you when I see you growing up and coming into a love season you becoming a young woman now you start having feelings but before you will expose yourself out there I took my skirt and I spread it over you praise the Lord but with all of that if you continue to read they forgot about all of that and they went into idolatry and he says you you you expose yourself to every tree you got yourself in every mess on the earth glory be to God you love the Lord this morning amen you got yourself in all of that and he went on to tell them you know all the Abominable things and all the things that they have got them themselves in I just didn't want to go into that you know and they faction thems after the word and you know uh the the the pick up every Idol every Idol when every new faction Idol comes up they pick it up forgot about the day that they were in the dumpster praise the Lord forgot about where Grace took you from Where Mercy met you praise the Lord but you see God is so good that's the beauty about this story amen he's letting Jerusalem knows that before you will go into all your all your mess all the horrible things you would do I spread my skirt over you that's very important I keep re-echoing there because I want to do it on this a little bit this morning praise the Lord I spread my skirt over you you know what the angel told Mary the Holy Ghost will overshadow you that's the same word I spread my skirt over you the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and the thing that will be done in your life it will be my work praise the Lord let's St it a little bit here before we go on let's Tell it a little bit when you go down to the Hebrew and you look at that word skirt the first word that comes out it means wins it means wins so when the seven angels spread their wings in Arizona God was praying his Curt over a bride I'm trying to get ahead of myself he knew all the things that we would go through how we will worship men Want To Worship the prophet and want to worship our church he knew the adolat that have eaten our heart but yet his prayer is Cur over us because it's his promise he's the one that said live hallah he knew what they were going to go into yet he said live oh my what a wonderful Jesus we ser oh praise the Lord the first word that comes out there it means Wings extremely Edge H and bother Conner skirt that's what it means that word skirt now you will see as as you look into the scripture we'll bring you some types so you can be able to see the picture of faith in our society men of great honor like the military the the generous you can tell the rank of a man by his tribes that he were Amen in in the in in in in the in the Hebrew days in the Bible days the rank of a man was you could tell it by the edge of His Garment that's right the border of His Garment that where he wore his rank praise the Lord that's the reason why that woman say if I can just touch the edge of His Garment I know I will be healed praise the Lord you go back and study in the Old Testament God told them they have to wear a blue ribbing around their garment but you could tell the rank of a man if the man was a wealthy man or the man was a king or he was a priest you could just tell by the edge of His Garment and his and and that edge of the Garment spread out it could become a skirt that was what Ruth said to boas throw your skirt over me praise the Lord because as long as boa does that it it was a sign of protection it was a sign of redemption are we together you look in the Bible also you will realize over in 1 Samuel chapter 15 when Saul disobeyed the the prophet Samuel and Samuel spoke to him let's just read that a little bit amen if I can just keep your mind in the scripture the Holy Ghost can be able to deal with your heart amen because he's he's the preacher I'm that praise the Lord you love the Lord first Samuel chapter 15 let's just read a verse or two there it will help me to catch my birth amen because uh you know what it's it's uh it's is is this thing with human human nature sometimes you get too excited and you overpass your strength amen you get too excited and I mean if you can just calm yourself down be you know just just try to be you get too excited you you realize that uh you put too much excitement into and then you miss the rear think so we don't want to do that this morning we want to take our time and bring the word to you amen if we don't finish we can continue another time verse 24 of 1 Samuel ch chap 15 the Bible says right here praise the Lord 1st Samuel chapter 15 verse 24 amen praise the Lord that just word uh uh uh uh uh uh Saul Samuel spoke to to to to Saul and says uh uh Rebellion is as wishcraft and stubbornness as iniquity but let's read from verse 24 and Saul said said unto Samuel I have seen it for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord and th words because I fear the people and obey their voice amen oh my I reading that I say Lord please help me amen never to fall in that trap to want to appease you and leave the word praise the Lord amen because this word will never leave us men will leave us people will leave us but this word will never leave us now therefore I pray the pardon my sin and turn turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto Saul I will I will not turn I will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord has rejected thee from being King over Israel and as Samuel turned about to go he laid hold Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his mener and a rent and Samuel said unto him the Lord has rent rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee this day and has given it to to a neighbor of dine that is better than thou and also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent praise the Lord amen now so we see right there that h h h uh uh Samuel got a hold of uh or Saul got a hold of Samuel's Curt and when he was moving uh you know it it rented so uh uh uh uh uh Samuel uh told him that that was a sign you know that uh the Lord has rented the kingdom the Lord has left thee that what Samuel told him you realize also there in the same Samuel you go down you read in chapter 24 that was where David to uh went down and and he and he went and caught a piece of uh sa garment and and the Bible say he caught his skirt you know he caught the Border that's the place that is important is the Border that's where you see the man's rank that's where you see his position praise the Lord you can see all the military people wearing the same uniform but you know the general when you see his tribe praise the Lord you know the captain you can see the okay they one is the sergeant but you see that guy coming down there with all of their decoration and everything here that's a general praise the Lord and and and and and so uh uh David went down and and then he caught uh you know that portion of uh of uh uh uh Sal garment and then he show it to him so you see that that was that was very very important so you can just think about it now here is God telling Israel you know what when you were just becoming a young woman when you were just entering into your Season of Love before you will get distracted in your mind will be polluted with all the lust and all the distraction around you I spread my skirt over you glory be to God I'll dwell on this before I come to my message because I love it praise the Lord just to know that 1963 God did the same thing for his bride Hallelujah that's the reason why those angels went went around they went around praise the Lord and that I don't have no regret of getting my element this morning praise the Lord because that's my element I love it amen I love it I read something to you praise the Lord maybe the Serv is my an year but I don't know Christ is the Myster of God revealed listen to what brother Brandon will say here he says he says that great Angel of the Covenant the one who was with Moses in the wilderness that one who came to Paul on the road of Damascus that same one permitted his picture to be taken with us the same one that was in the picture in Life Magazine now I'm going like I said I'm going to get in my element you see it that is the reason why oh yeah I miss it I miss it I've I've thought about it overtaken in my mind I was going to put a picture up of uh uh brother Brandon with a hell light over his head and the picture of the Seven Angels you see every preacher has their inspiration amen and uh I mean uh uh that's that's my inspiration you see it was out of inspiration that I blew that picture out there in the hallway praise the Lord because you see what happened in Houston God was identifying himself with the messenger praise the Lord but what happened on Mount Sunset God was identifying himself with me praise the Lord amen God was identifying himself with the bride you will realize there were there are three faces of the ministry the first pool the second pool and the and the and God allowed that three most uh H H Supernatural picture will be taken that represented every pool of the ministry praise the Lord the Halo picture was on the first pull because brother Brandon was was defending Divine Healing you know the story about it and then there is a picture where honor discernment God allow the camera to take a death spirit standing behind somebody there was a Sanic Vindication of the second p and the third P which is the opening of the word praise the Lord the message of Redemption where God just like boas did to rof in the field God met his prophet in the field and seven angels He spread his Curt and those angels went fly and he allow signs once again proving the tle the opening of the word praise the Lord that everything that is written in that book will be redeemed praise the Lord just like Moses told Pharaoh we are not going to lay one thing behind oh yes God knew that is will go into idolatry he knew that Jerusalem will PR they will prostitute themselves to every Idol but before they do that he say I spread my skirt over you praise the Lord I spread my skirt over you I have called you to be mine praise the Lord amen when Ruth came back and told Naomi what Bo has did on the field she said my daughter rest if he spread his cour over you he will not rest until he do all the work of redemption if God spread his Curt over this bride you can say anything about the seven angels see anything about the picture God will not rest until he get a bride praise the Lord Brother Bram said the same one permitted his picture to be taken with us he didn't said to be taken with me he said to be taken with us that's our representation that's our representation that's our Redemption praise the Lord I'm more identified with that picture up there than the picture in Houston I believe the picture in Houston but my identification is under that cloud that's that's what open the word to my heart I'm not following the message because of Divine Healing then Houston is is okay for me I believe Divine Healing I believe the H H the rebuking of of sickness and discernment and all of that but my identification is under that cloud praise the Lord Brother BR preached a message influence to us and many things that we don't grab we stayed in the you know we we we get we get caught up in the cracks and BR Brown would would teach in uh influence and then he would let us to see how Isaiah fed under the influence of UAH the king and he would talk about one man influence upon another but what we don't see also in that message there was an influence that came from an angel the angel that was in the temple praise the Lord when the sarapin were in the temple when Isaiah went back to the house of the Lord and he saw the Angels moving in the temple he was caught up into a vision and he saw that the temple door move because of the speed you will realize that that had more influence than the influence that Uzziah had on him because it changed his life when he came under the influence of those angels He said who is me Lord am then he received a visitation from an angel the angel took a life card and came and touch his Li why because he was under a superior influence he was under the influence of angels and because he got under the influence of Angels the influence of Uzziah could no longer influence him PR praise the Lord and that's what I'm want to tell you this morning church this bride this bride you must count yourself privileged to come stepping into a message Church count yourself privileged don't think that the church depend on you for us to run praise the Lord our dependency is on him praise the lord we have walked into things that we don't have no idea where we are standing praise the Lord can you imagine Moses standing in the present of the burning bush and taking stones and chunking it at the fire that is some of our attitude can you imagine he's standing in the present of the burning bush he's Gathering dust I need to cut this fire off be careful how you call it or it might burn you it might consume you it I struck you dead because this is not an organization it's not a denomination this message is the presence of God it's the presence of God that is brought to Mortal people it's not something that you can join how was how was a child form in her womb how did God do it he did it by spreading his Curt the Holy Ghost shall over Shadow you that's what it means god spread his Curt of redemption over Mary come out of my skirt girl praise the Lord he made all young just like he said to Jerusalem before the man will touch you before the man will contaminate you with doctrines and different teachings and different beliefs and different thing I spread my scour over you that you will go you will go praise the Lord you will go but I've already claimed you as mine as pray Mas oh thank you Jesus hallelujah oh my praise the Lord oh my God what am I preaching this morning glory be to God I feel like I'm having a convention amen I'm sounding like I'm having a convention you look like 2,000 people before my eyes this morning because there is more with us than what is against us amen hallelujah glory be to God are we together let's read that if they can p up this for me the seed is not held with the shark let's read that this morning if they can I will still read it remember a virgin word time Amen brother BR says remember the time that we are living in is a virgin word time praise the Lord hallelujah if you put it in the hands of a denomination it sure won't be a virgin praise the Lord you see what God did he went ahead of Joseph that she would not be touched by a man that's the same thing he did to Jerusalem before she would go into all adolat she went he went ahead of her and spread his Curt before she will be touched by Doctrine by beliefs by this this is what I believe this is what I believe yeah this is what I before you will get into all of that Prophet will tell us that he dropped his virgin word he dropped that sea word in the soul that you go from one believe to another Bel in this this this this but that word would not be touched he says remember the Virgin word time if you put it in the hand of a denomination it surely won't be virgin but God's church is not touched by denomination praise the Lord God T church is not touched by denomination no no God is Not Looking For Better Mentor let's do it like this let's do it like this now that's not why God is looking for he's looking for men he's looking for Sons and Daughters he's not looking for better that let's do it maybe if we do it like that it will be better if God would have waited for you to go to high school graduate before he decide to create the heaven in the Earth where you have even St where were you going to stand but God's church is not touched by the denomination is a virgin born word of God made manifest the Church of Jesus is a virgin born word it is what God is doing in your soul it is how that word is teaching your life how it's drawing you to God every day that's God's Church because he knows people will make Idol out of their Church they will make Idol out of their Pastor they will make Idol out of the Prophet that is the thing that is common with men why because the amorites were our father the Hittites were our mother they were all Idols worshipper so it's easy for Jerusalem to breathe into that but he said before you get there I spread my skirt over you praise the Lord before you get there I'll spread my skirt over you Hallelujah when Ruth came home and she told Naomi you won't believe what happened today she said what happy my daughter praise the Lord oh th old veteran mother she knew she was just there was something she was waiting for praise the Lord amen she was born in Israel she knew what the Lord says I went into his field and it was about EV time and all the men were drunk and they were all lying all over the place and you know I was just creeping trying to find the lord of the Harvest I was a bit scared I was scared because I didn't know what they would do to me but I saw him lying there and I went by his tent and he saw me he said my daughter what are you doing here praise the Lord she said I sat by his feet and do you know what he did he took his CT and he cover me praise the Lord I can see now me strength coming back as a youth because she jumped out of her chair and she started to shout and rejoice and she said my daughter if you don't want to go on the field don't go back there anymore if you don't don't want to work just go to sleep because he's not going to rest what do you mean you don't know you don't know what he did was very significant praise the Lord what he did it shows that you have attracted him praise the Lord a man of his caliber will not do that to anybody praise the Lord he took his Curt and he covered me praise the Lord oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen you don't have room for me to preach this morning but I've been managing with this I can stay manage with it amen praise the Lord if I get to ex I open this door and run outside glory be to God oh my you don't know what that means you don't know what that means when you think about the deadness and the coldness praise the Lord that is coming among people that is exposed to this glorious message no time to pray no consecration compromising on things and you remember that God says I will get a bride as a preacher it gives you strength to preach the next day when you are preaching and you are yelling and you find people doing things contrary to what you are saying when there is just everything in the book to discourage you but you remember that he pray his Curt you remember that he says the bride will come back in preview so you keep preaching you keep waiting to see a bride to see a people that will rise up to the opportunity you keep waiting to see it oh Hallelujah praise the Lord but God's church is not touched by the denomination she is a virgin born word of God made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah how wonderful I love it he says I know that is the truth there there will be no denominational men hindering no denominational men hindering praise the Lord God has not committed us to the hands of a man he committed us under the wings of seven angels he have not committed us so men can fall they can make a disgrace of the Gospel if the SE word is in you you pick up your Bible and you move on praise the Lord why should want should use the failure of a mortal man to stop worshiping an immortal God why should should you look at a poor example of a man that did not give birth to himself a man who God's grace took from a a a a dumper a dumpster bam said that's what it is life at its best is a dumb we all are just in it looking for Treasure looking for better job looking for higher education sometimes you dig in there you find you find a portrait oh wow this is beautiful I can't believe they throw this thing away oh my somebody dumb is now going to be is going to make your house pretty you're going to take it take it away and and clean it up and put it in your house wow that's beautiful but where you took it from where you talk it from praise the Lord and pray the you start lying to people that you bought it from Walmart praise the Lord there will be no denomination of men hindering in the in the Virgin birth of the Bride if God never use a man and he overshadow Merit to bring the son of God God the same way he brought Eve that's the Adam that's the way he brought Eve the same way he brought Christ that's the way this bride is going to come out the bride will not come from joining church this bride will come from the word the spoken word the birth of Jesus was on this wise so will the birth of the bribe be just like the birth of Christ was so will the bride birth be God will use men to encourage us he will use men to advise us he will use men to preach to us to pray for us but he will not bring his bride through enemy when he cycle the Earth with those seven angels God committ it to himself when those angels flewed around he told his Prophet return back to Jefferson B and preach those seals because I have spread my skirt they might not believe the message but I will get a bride praise the Lord they might go on YouTube and say anything but I will get a bride because I said live when I saw hard I said live there will be no denominational Man hening in The Bride birth in the Virgin birth of the Bride no sir she's commanded by God to come out of such touch not their unclean thing that's what brother Brandon says Revelation 3 he says when Revelation 3 when the Bible says behold I stand at the door and knock he said when he was knocking he said that was the very same time Revelation 184 sounded he was knocking but over in Revelation 18:4 the knock says come out of all my people and be now partaker of her sin if we only knew what we have come to if we only knew what we have in our hands what we call the message praise the Lord the greatest move that almighty God ever had you see how how those angels were moving before Isaiah so fast he says their their their train filled the temple if you studed there it was the wings of the angels that were lock to to one another you know and when bream talks about the vision Hing Hing to the cloud he talks about how it started from a little bird and it goes to a bigger bird and and he talks about the wings of the Angels blending together to form that cloud and our Lord step right down in it and say I have spread my skirt over you praise the Lord you see that is the reason why people fight against the cloud more than they fight against the picture in Houston the picture in Houston stays right in the library in DC people cannot deny that they cannot deny it they cannot deny that that was the pillow of fire but when it comes to the cloud they fight against it why why they fight against it because it's the bride identification they don't want you to believe your identification they don't want you to believe that you can make it in this age they don't want you to believe you can overcome because if there is no evidence what are we holding to just because we join the church we baptized in Jesus name is that why we are holding to praise the Lord when we just see people making a disgrace out of the grace of God remember what what I said on Wednesday night Esau played down the breight he thought that it meant nothing to him bre is just a title Holy Ghost is just a title he play it down in so much that when it came to the blessing oh yeah okay I will catch I catch let me go do I get better things to do I will catch that meat at the end of the day before I fix the soup and carry it daddy say I should bringing soup so he went about doing all that he wanted to do at the end of the day now then he come bringing that the blessing is gone the blessing is gone praise the Lord wait for us to beg you to make your life right make wait for us to beg you for you to get get back into the service of God be a Son of God stand for the wait for us to beg you the time you will needed the most I pray that there be grace for you praise the Lord the time we have the grace of God and you have people around you to encourage you people of lack pressure fi to come together sing sound and let's pray together let's read the word of God let get a brother back here and encourage us and preach the word of God you're so busy you are so busy you are so occupied what the Paul says in Hebrew he said Esau wept bitterly he wept bitterly but there was nothing to be found the father told him I can do nothing I've given the blessing out I pray that none of us be fall to that place may we wake up to the reality with everything that is happening around us the word is on fire can you see it the word is on fire that's when our soul supposed to be on fire when the world is on fire our soul supposed to be on fire for the things of God we're supposed to be getting back to the place that we supposed to be finding a place to spend time with God we go through the week where the Bible people I go I can play message what message are you playing oh I read the verse of the day that is enough to satisfy your soul the verse of the day is enough to satisfy your soul praise the Lord you see I'm preaching the message of redemption praise the Lord I'm trying to tell you that God word will not return back to him vow a one he was the one that found us when we were in the midst of our sin and unbelief buying down to Holy Merit submitting ourself to delusional teaching in denomination he find us he grab our attention praise the Lord amen we never went after him he came after us what would that little baby did how how could that baby just born help itself there is nothing he could have done to jump out of the dumpster to even lift for his hand and say somebody help me he never even had the the the he couldn't do anything and that's just how you and myself were but God reached down his hands in his mercy and now we think that we are in control of it we can choose to do what we want to do no matter how the grace of God speak to our heart we lock our heart because we have become Idol to ourself that is the idol in this age self worship we have become Idol to ourself it has to be my way or not you are just worshiping yourself you have cut your own tree down you have fashioned your own God that looks like you is angry like you it's ugly like you I have to make myself happy you have to make yourself happy are you really happy are you really happy do you think that that Mary in herself after all the Welling plans she have made do you think in her natural self she was happy for her wedding to be caught off to take a reproach a stigma on herself but yet she had the courage to say be it unto me according to your word when will we come to that place I can get through reading this thing let me read this thing and and allow you to go here oh Hallelujah you love the Lord Brother bam says in the message Witness say he says for she was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost truly overshadow a person they take God at his word praise the Lord be it unto me according to your word when the Holy Ghost truly overshadow a person we don't we don't pray on our feelings we don't pray it on our our self uh you know H pleasure and why we just we just want to gratify ourself but I believe it church I'm telling you just like I stand before you this morning I still remember the first day I walked through those doors still remember where I sat down it was somewhere in that corner it was only two rows having no idea that I'll Stand before you as your pastor but I'm telling you by the grace of God I promise the Lord to do my best the best that I can praise the Lord because I know he have already spread his Curt he have already spreaded his CT glory be to God Amen you know one thing that I attract me to the city it was right in this city where the angel of the Lord came down and told brother Brandon you will have a son and call him Joseph it was somewhere in the bloomy turn praise the Lord and I believe that if God called a Son of God in this city I believe there are sons of God lying in this city that God is going to raise up I believe that I hold to that with the hour that we are living in is it a time for us to be beging you what are you doing for the Lord how are you helping this assembly how are you helping this church how are you helping it it's everyone of our responsibility and I don't anybody responsible I hold myself responsible I don't blame anybody I blame myself when you are not coming to church I don't blame you I blame myself oh I believe that change I told you I would get in my element this morning but I'm feeling good amen you know that I'm not angry with you praise the Lord I mean there is just so much things happening every day every day I try to look into the Minneapolis news and I say oh God see the evil that is overtaking the city see the evil that is overtaking the city when d r was killed here we couldn't even gather yet during the week they were using this parking lot for rioting you were not coming I was coming every night here with uh uh the few brothers that were come but Jordan and uh uh his wife fate and Aram play the piano this whole place was F praise the Lord I was thinking as this one day will come I will come here and and they would just break that glass that whole glass down but yet God watch over this place he watched over this place for his name's sake praise the Lord most everybody that comes here drive about 20 25 minutes 30 minutes praise the Lord most everybody the church meeting I wanted to have that that's what I'm having [Laughter] so praise the Lord I didn't want her to have it this way I wanted I wanted for it to be so there are things I'm not talking but uh let's let me preach my message this morning oh praise the Lord you love the Lord let's Give the Lord a hand of Praise amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord hallelujah praise the Lord I'm telling you I don't know where I found the energy from but I'm so energized these days to believe that God will get himself a memorial in this city praise the Lord he will get himself a memorial you are welcome to be a part if you want to but I believe it I believe it praise the Lord about a 16 years or 17 years old boy that got into a city did not know anybody in that City praise the Lord that was back 1993 I didn't know anybody in that City I just got off of the train so dead because I was sitting in the bucket of the train I went around I went to the to the market square and I thought I said I said I I I'm sure I would see somebody that I know this this is the market area I will see I went around the market three times and a young man called me he called me he said he call me he come he says I've seen you going around three times are you looking for somebody I said well I'm new to the city I don't I don't I don't know anybody I'm just walking around to see anybody I will look he said come come he's put me right by his Marketplace he was selling he said look if if these soldiers see you they will think you are un recuring but I will take you to my house I did not know him from Adam he says I will take you to my house he took me to his house make me to shower took me back on the road bought food for me and told me to stay to his place until I can find somebody well just as a young man I never went there there with any burden but God knew that a little group will rise up in that City praise the Lord as a 16 17 years old young man I still believe that God today praise the Lord amen I went to that City not knowing anybody but when I came to the city I knew somebody praise the Lord amen and God give us the first church praise the Lord I remind myself on that all the time praise the Lord and I tell you I don't have energy to run after people that have just hanging around this message you want to beg you to come to church I'm asking God to send me a sinner on the street so if you say brother one not calling me that's the reason why let me tell you now because we have heard so much so much has been preached across this pit for us to be playing church I rather go after the young man that is on drugs or some prostitute in the street but I believe February 18 I believe 1963 God's prayer his Curt over a bride that was going to be born because the bride will be birthed out of the opening of the seals he SP his Curt praise the Lord if God did not use mered effort he didn't use Joseph contribution he never even went to the Pharisees all he used was an angel called Gabriel all he used was an angel called G Gabriel and I believe an angel has spoken to us in this age all he used was an angel and when she heard that angel word she said be it unto me and she got conceived listening to the angel word praise the lord we play the tape here Sunday morning so you can hear the angel speaking listening to the angel and when he speak to you say be it unto me according to your word praise the Lord amen oh what an awesome God we serve when the Holy Ghost truly overshadow a person they thank God at his word that settle it what the Holy Holy Ghost said he said thou settle it praise the Lord he said thou settle it be not afraid we're going to close right here or somewhere right here when you take the Virgin birth out of Christianity you knock the foundation from under it if you take the Virgin birth what does that mean what does that mean if you take the Virgin birth out of Christianity you knock the foundation if you are depending on a man or a person to get the Holy Ghost you knock the foundation from honor Yourself Praise the Lord God still speaks amen he still give the holy go he still deliver he still heals he's the same yesterday today and forever when you take the Virgin birth out of Christianity if you can believe that without our human effort God is able to meet you one onone just like he met Mary God is able to deal with you he's able to use this word praise the Lord he's able to grab your attention until you will sock this book with your tears when you take the Virgin birth out of Christianity you knock the foundation from honor it if he was the blood of a man then he was no more than I am or you are but it was the blood of God God Holy Spirit over shaded the Virgin and created a blood cells that's what the new birth is that's what the Holy Ghost is all about is God overshadowing you and creating a new life in you it's not joining church it's not choosing the pastor is God overshadowing you God bringing you to the place where you surrounder your being to him and he start a new work in you and you can feel it because it wake you up to pray you can feel it when that old temper nature starts to come up it hold you back you can feel it when the tongue want to lie you say sorry sorry I'm I'm I'm misspeaking I'll tell you what what is the truth you can feel it because it's real God overshadowing you and creating the work in you that will bring all your members into subjection praise the Lord when that little seed was in marriage she was running all over the place going to see Elizabeth but when the seed starts to grow it starts to control her she couldn't walk again like like that young lady amen it tell her lay back and rest so she works like this amen the C said lay back I'm going to lead you you're not leading me and service after service service after service those Brothers come pass through here and from nowhere they come and speak things and all you see is God once again spreading his CT over you said God so Lov me that a preacher will come and speak something that will minister to my inner soul he saw all the mess that we would go into but before we got there his pray his skurt 1963 praise the Lord oh Lord Jesus please have mercy upon me please forgive me Lord help me make me the son that you want me to be the holy ghost overshadowed the virgin and created a blood cell and that and that's the blood of God the Bible says we are saved through the blood of God not a man praise the Lord not a man it's God he's the one that is working in us he's the one working in us mightily let's read birth pains listen to what he says in birth pain he said but Mary with that baby in her arm it didn't make any difference what they Tau Mary knew whose son that was she does so does every believer that accept God's word into their heart the problem is is De we are taking the word in the womb of our mind and not allowing that word to drop in the womb of our heart that's why we can argue about it we can f about it we can give ourself reasons because you just have it in the womb of your mind so does every believer that accept God's word into their heart I don't care what the system says you know what it is it's a promise of God it was revealed to you by the Holy Ghost when you were overshadowed by his power his power will overshadow you and that thing that will be formed in you will be a holy thing called the son of God praise the Lord now joining the church is being overshadow let God overshadow
