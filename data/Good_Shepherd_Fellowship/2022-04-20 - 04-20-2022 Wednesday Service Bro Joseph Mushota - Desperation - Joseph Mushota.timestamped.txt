[51:51] but god will help us right
[51:53] i just don't want to read there is a lot
[51:55] of reading and scriptures but i really
[51:57] want the leading of the holy spirit
[52:01] the dealing with the spirit is very good
[52:03] because
[52:05] that's the way god knows our problem
[52:08] i always like to be off not when i'm
[52:10] connected i'm okay i feel now i'm going
[52:14] yeah but when i'm not connected
[52:15] sometimes we just read but when he comes
[52:18] that anointing then he just pick up
[52:20] every solution
[52:24] everyone receive is he's myself i'm
[52:26] receiving my when that that anointing
[52:29] is not me is it him
[52:31] me i'm also preaching to myself that's
[52:33] why you have to know it's not joseph
[52:36] so don't be mad on me
[52:39] i'm just
[52:40] he's servant right
[52:42] because god will ask me
[52:46] that day because now is me and the god
[52:50] now today this wednesday i love when i'm
[52:53] in the bench they're gonna ask the
[52:54] pastor when he's preaching me i'm there
[52:56] just a child amen hallelujah
[52:58] is very responsible trying to
[53:01] clear atmosphere go to work
[53:03] because they were asking him that they
[53:05] were spreading
[53:06] i gave you that day
[53:08] you just play you didn't prepare you see
[53:11] so i don't know but now i just want you
[53:14] to pray for me right there in your heart
[53:17] i used to preach praises bridges but
[53:20] this day i don't want to preach i want
[53:22] him to preach
[53:24] because we we realized
[53:26] that we preach many years
[53:30] we cut stuff
[53:32] we preach we pray
[53:35] we
[53:36] bring anointing i don't know what can
[53:38] you say
[53:39] but sometimes you know you notice
[53:41] something
[53:43] the things they can condemn this sunday
[53:46] at the pulpit
[53:48] but the next sunday become worse
[53:51] that things are noticed that sometimes
[53:54] some yes they change some they become
[53:57] worse
[53:59] yeah so
[54:00] sometimes myself i ask
[54:03] what's going on
[54:06] what's going on that's why
[54:09] when a preacher is preaching
[54:12] though the preaching
[54:14] is not profitable to you
[54:18] don't be mad there is a somebody is a
[54:22] profitable to him
[54:26] because sometimes as the old-timer
[54:28] believers
[54:30] sometimes we become somehow annoyed
[54:34] when a preacher go a little bit down
[54:38] yeah but i pray god i i don't have the
[54:40] attitude anymore
[54:42] yeah if you
[54:43] these things we passed already
[54:45] we are in the seventh cells here just
[54:47] being of the mystery here just beginning
[54:49] for babies there is some these two
[54:51] babies they need those food absolutely
[54:53] amen amen
[54:57] we god has chosen us before the fullness
[55:00] of the world
[55:02] yes let me start from oh my goodness
[55:05] this is the last quote but i start now
[55:07] the first that's why i always this day
[55:09] my brother said i put the numbers i can
[55:12] think i can study that one but i start
[55:13] with the last one okay let us go to the
[55:16] last one
[55:17] almost the last
[55:20] okay
[55:23] sorry i didn't send there but i'm
[55:25] reading on in the book of rapture
[55:29] 65 december 14
[55:31] paragraph
[55:32] 31 and i think that
[55:36] i speaking i just don't try to get up
[55:41] here to say something that i think i
[55:44] will please the people
[55:47] i never been
[55:49] guilty of that
[55:51] i want to get up
[55:53] here and say something as i feel led to
[55:57] say it
[55:58] that i think would be a help to you
[56:03] something that you further your
[56:06] experience
[56:07] with god
[56:09] if you are a christian just listen
[56:12] carefully if you are a christian and you
[56:14] are born a christian make you
[56:17] okay if you are a christian and if you
[56:20] are not a christian
[56:21] make you so ashamed of yourself
[56:26] that you will become a christian
[56:29] and that's the purpose that i've always
[56:32] tried to line up my thought as lord
[56:35] would
[56:36] lead
[56:37] you see how the prophet this is rapture
[56:41] 65
[56:42] is is a five message after that what is
[56:45] the four message before we finish the
[56:46] preaching
[56:48] so
[56:50] sometimes
[56:52] the way
[56:53] the different preacher bring the message
[56:56] yeah you have to take it as a raise
[57:00] the things are killing
[57:02] the believer is a reasoning
[57:06] this message is not about you you're
[57:08] smart at school forget about your
[57:10] smartness
[57:12] you can't be smart
[57:14] than god
[57:17] god is wise intelligent everything is
[57:20] god knows can you imagine albert
[57:23] einstein
[57:25] a unbeliever in working is a
[57:27] mathematician but abraham said he enter
[57:29] in a laboratory of god
[57:31] where there is a
[57:34] knowledge very high knowledge
[57:36] are you intelligent more than habits
[57:38] albert
[57:40] you see so
[57:42] as we when you enter in the another
[57:45] world in the spirit
[57:47] you can enter them without mathematics
[57:50] of the world mathematics is the only
[57:52] christian you can enter where albert
[57:55] enter and to over because he entered
[57:57] they it eat the eternity but he doesn't
[58:00] know if he's going or not
[58:04] yeah he's found the speed of light i
[58:06] think you know the story so now
[58:09] you are more than our bed is time
[58:13] i want to tell you this message is not
[58:15] about coding
[58:18] is not about memorizing
[58:20] it's about life
[58:25] it's about life
[58:29] so that's why sometimes we use
[58:31] wrong back
[58:33] someone can preach life we saw him ah
[58:36] say baby preach us a mystery
[58:39] those are to preach big mysteries today
[58:41] some they are not giving the message
[58:45] when you want to found the proof of this
[58:48] message
[58:49] you will be you found proof out
[58:52] we receive this message by faith
[58:56] there is nothing you can attach this is
[58:58] the message of the how i can attach and
[58:59] explain nothing
[59:01] the things of god we receive by faith
[59:06] now
[59:07] good thing is and the good news is
[59:11] god himself
[59:12] must get to you
[59:14] must enter into you he himself must
[59:17] believe his own word
[59:21] that's why you came here we create
[59:23] atmosphere
[59:25] then god can
[59:27] find a way
[59:28] for you that's why brother branham said
[59:31] if the pro if the pasta if is a arrogant
[59:35] you'll find the church also will be
[59:37] arrogant if a preacher is not yet born
[59:40] again it doesn't ever be a
[59:43] burning bush he must not to preach
[59:46] because he will be preaching you
[59:47] receiving his spirit
[59:49] that's why the prophet said the church
[59:51] the way you pray to found the church
[59:53] that's the way you find your wife that's
[59:56] the same way you have to pray to fund
[59:58] the church don't play just any enemy
[1:00:00] just sit you going in the town any
[1:00:02] church you sit and you're gonna get a
[1:00:04] spirit and to come out you'll be in
[1:00:06] trouble
[1:00:08] clear then for the lord
[1:00:11] [Applause]
[1:00:15] so
[1:00:18] but abram said sometimes we
[1:00:21] we we preach in a such way
[1:00:23] some it could bring some out
[1:00:26] some to ponder over some to think
[1:00:28] it's a purposely when i just said
[1:00:31] uh
[1:00:32] if you don't eat my flesh don't drink my
[1:00:34] blood he never explain it
[1:00:37] why because he knows there's a some
[1:00:39] predestinated
[1:00:43] whatever they don't understand they will
[1:00:44] stick with me
[1:00:46] there's something in me i can't it's
[1:00:48] going to pull and pull away from my lord
[1:00:51] even if you take me even if you take me
[1:00:53] to hell i'm going to hell ever were
[1:00:55] gonna kick me out because the holy
[1:00:56] spirit will never go to hell clapton for
[1:00:58] the lord amen glory be to god praise god
[1:01:01] glory be to god jesus himself he went to
[1:01:05] hell he kicked the devil he took the key
[1:01:08] why didn't you stay there and if you
[1:01:10] have the same jesus in your heart right
[1:01:13] now you say i'm going to hell they're
[1:01:15] going to teach you where is your place
[1:01:17] we want to you here go away there is
[1:01:20] only hell and heaven come on now
[1:01:22] hallelujah
[1:01:23] [Applause]

[1:01:54] i'm reading desperation
[1:01:57] every man press into it
[1:01:59] not just simply walk in into it
[1:02:03] easily but it's got to be pressed into
[1:02:07] see now when you seek me
[1:02:10] with all your heart then i'll be found
[1:02:15] paragraph

[1:03:34] one going to bring me orange going to
[1:03:36] bring water he didn't want to go in when
[1:03:38] they just left
[1:03:41] he left
[1:03:43] so 10 minutes before
[1:03:45] 10 minutes five d for those minutes
[1:03:47] before you go you know exactly where you
[1:03:49] are going
[1:03:53] and the babanam is saying said
[1:03:55] don't wait that last minute
[1:03:59] to start to fix your life
[1:04:04] emergency
[1:04:05] let's talk about images the nature of
[1:04:08] human being they always wait the last
[1:04:10] minute now uh you know dakar it's me i
[1:04:14] stole it forgive me
[1:04:17] you know that now it's fear
[1:04:24] emergency so baba said you ask the
[1:04:27] christian we must not wait that time
[1:04:30] we can create our emergency
[1:04:33] in
[1:04:34] loving
[1:04:36] god
[1:04:37] when you start to love more god
[1:04:40] more god
[1:04:41] you become just grace of him when it's
[1:04:44] about god
[1:04:45] you feel like he's here it's like
[1:04:48] you i'm talking to my brother danny so
[1:04:50] even when you are there you feel when
[1:04:52] more you closer we come closer to god it
[1:04:55] brings more thirsty more desire more
[1:04:57] emergency in your heart
[1:05:00] praise the lord that's why we must come
[1:05:03] to church together to receive something
[1:05:07] always
[1:05:09] you can stay home we can read the
[1:05:11] balcony pray it's different one day by
[1:05:13] the banana was at the puppet he said you
[1:05:16] know i i i wrinkled my my eyes to one
[1:05:20] lady she just entered right now
[1:05:22] she is my daughter
[1:05:24] i'm happy she came in this presence
[1:05:27] for her to receive the holy spirit
[1:05:30] it was
[1:05:31] 1965.
[1:05:33] he's talking about rebecca so brother
[1:05:36] branham couldn't give his own daughter
[1:05:39] holy spirit's home
[1:05:42] he couldn't even start to pray for her
[1:05:44] then god give give no
[1:05:48] she must come to the right atmosphere
[1:05:52] where they create atmosphere
[1:05:55] and you must have a right attitude
[1:05:58] when god is dealing for others some
[1:06:00] people they are missing a blessing
[1:06:02] some they are getting their blessing
[1:06:05] then you also you must open your heart
[1:06:08] that's why sometimes by abraham can
[1:06:09] create we want the healing for a
[1:06:12] lady of which was like
[1:06:14] 12 years old
[1:06:16] and the babylon said
[1:06:19] what can i do
[1:06:21] she was having a
[1:06:22] a a appendicitis appendix you all call
[1:06:26] it in english
[1:06:28] appending right
[1:06:29] yeah so she was going to that those
[1:06:31] years no these this is just raised they
[1:06:34] killed those days it was a serious
[1:06:36] sickness she was going to die
[1:06:39] and the
[1:06:40] abraham reached the place and they said
[1:06:43] uh are you a christian say yes do you
[1:06:45] have faith yes yes i have facebook i
[1:06:48] have faith okay and the bible saw that
[1:06:50] he didn't have a faith she have she has
[1:06:53] hope
[1:06:55] hope is enemy to faith
[1:06:58] you can stay long there you think it's
[1:07:00] the faith it's too hot right
[1:07:02] then but
[1:07:03] as a prophet he saw it
[1:07:06] he said i want to help her
[1:07:09] and he said what can i do and they start
[1:07:11] to create that's why you are god
[1:07:15] you cannot create it's because you just
[1:07:18] have a fear
[1:07:19] that's why fear i had to fear
[1:07:22] any way to pass closer to me i kick you
[1:07:25] out to fear something i always say my
[1:07:27] when i'm i'm i'm very
[1:07:30] very dangerous i want to involve an
[1:07:32] accident fear left me that's where i can
[1:07:35] master this
[1:07:36] the will still running like it's me i'm
[1:07:38] unaffected
[1:07:42] i say that after the event all the
[1:07:44] action
[1:07:46] but when i'm in that event it's like i'm
[1:07:49] a principal actor i'm acting now
[1:07:54] and when you stop
[1:07:56] they were if you were with me i do
[1:07:58] remember that they were coming to church
[1:08:00] on the snow i'm telling you my truck go
[1:08:03] left right
[1:08:06] my wife was said but she was screaming
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:20] glory to god
[1:08:30] i was going in the ditch
[1:08:33] so you see fear is something very bad
[1:08:36] when you have it over fear praise the
[1:08:38] devil
[1:08:39] and the most of people they die they
[1:08:41] injured because of fear
[1:08:45] fear something very bad i don't like
[1:08:47] fear sometimes you can feel fear for
[1:08:50] from norway you don't know where it came
[1:08:52] from you just it's come see what for
[1:08:55] fear get out of my fear
[1:08:59] glory be to god clap the end for the
[1:09:01] lord
[1:09:06] okay let me finish the story i always
[1:09:08] that store i don't finish
[1:09:10] i'm like i'm also like brother and i
[1:09:12] like stories
[1:09:15] okay
[1:09:16] now
[1:09:18] as we are the creator
[1:09:20] but the brahmanam want to create the
[1:09:23] faith
[1:09:24] in the girl
[1:09:27] now
[1:09:28] the one who is not concerned
[1:09:31] they're gonna judge wrong and they can
[1:09:33] be beaten
[1:09:35] by
[1:09:36] god
[1:09:37] so to protect them the neighbor where
[1:09:40] they were there and the parent they say
[1:09:42] you guys
[1:09:43] what i'm going to do now
[1:09:46] you you you don't i don't want you to
[1:09:48] see it
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] only the girl
[1:09:52] turn your your chair
[1:09:54] i don't want you you to see it all of
[1:09:55] them they turn their chair
[1:09:57] they and they remain of the girl
[1:10:00] you told me you have faith yes yes but
[1:10:02] not my faith okay
[1:10:04] can you take a division i was there and
[1:10:06] the red robe was there and they look at
[1:10:09] they say can you you know that red
[1:10:11] robe can you turn a left right with your
[1:10:15] eyes oh that is a mysticism
[1:10:18] it's always the bible says yes is in the
[1:10:19] bible remember jesus he spoke to the
[1:10:22] tree the tree dried did he touch the
[1:10:24] tree he just spoke
[1:10:28] by faith he can do that i can't do that
[1:10:30] then you don't believe it you don't have
[1:10:32] a faith so brother branham was helping
[1:10:35] her
[1:10:36] to to little to let go down her guards
[1:10:40] to recognize a
[1:10:42] a leak a spot link she doesn't have it
[1:10:47] that's where christian today they're
[1:10:49] very stubborn in the message
[1:10:52] you are trying to help
[1:10:54] they don't want to be helped they think
[1:10:56] that they've got it they're already in
[1:10:58] heaven here they just to visit they're
[1:11:00] going back when they are not yet even be
[1:11:04] served with the genuine holy spirit
[1:11:06] that's why sometimes people they can be
[1:11:09] 30 years in the message and after they
[1:11:11] quit the puppet
[1:11:13] it imposed i'm telling you it's
[1:11:14] impossible someone is distilled inside
[1:11:18] and they go away from the seal it's
[1:11:20] impossible you can't get away from the
[1:11:22] seal if god seals you you don't listen
[1:11:26] he take you off from the earth
[1:11:31] if you see someone going nonsense
[1:11:33] nothing he'll never be served
[1:11:35] because that seal you never get away
[1:11:38] but the baptism you can get away
[1:11:41] baptism can baptize you around you your
[1:11:44] soul in the spirit
[1:11:45] and you can do miracles you can stop
[1:11:48] things you can do a lot of things
[1:11:51] one day it's gonna leave you
[1:11:53] you become like you never believe you
[1:11:55] become worse than a believer
[1:11:59] you start to do things more than
[1:12:01] those that are not believing
[1:12:04] that's that's where we read that these
[1:12:06] are sometimes we ask i'll just take you
[1:12:08] somewhere
[1:12:10] can you ask yourself
[1:12:12] the disciples
[1:12:14] this is homework
[1:12:16] every day when you wake up
[1:12:18] think about that one
[1:12:20] why they disciples except judas
[1:12:24] those they were 120 they received the
[1:12:26] holy spirit did you read that the
[1:12:29] backslide
[1:12:32] no
[1:12:33] until stephen they stone him beautiful
[1:12:37] but he said forgive me forgive them
[1:12:39] what was that so what what which kind of
[1:12:42] us the holy spirit we have we have
[1:12:44] hatred
[1:12:46] we have nonsense holy spirit so
[1:12:49] what what's going on in the assemblies
[1:12:51] is not anything in the weirdo what we
[1:12:53] the news what is going on so when you
[1:12:56] hear far away don't laugh a fit don't be
[1:13:00] checking too much in your internet ask
[1:13:02] yourself
[1:13:04] there is a level where you will never
[1:13:06] know is the between the new the
[1:13:10] sanctification and the to cross with
[1:13:13] seal are very close it's matthew 24 24
[1:13:17] you take the grace of god to say the
[1:13:20] difference because judas was justified
[1:13:23] was that sanctified the time of the holy
[1:13:26] spirit rich he show his color
[1:13:32] it's very important this holy spirit
[1:13:35] tomorrow it's very very very very
[1:13:39] important the pastors they brought us in
[1:13:41] the message the elders that we used to
[1:13:44] order on them today most of them they
[1:13:46] are outside that's why they don't like
[1:13:49] this kind of preaching they can kill you
[1:13:51] they can poison you but we are going to
[1:13:53] preach it until god is going to seal his
[1:13:56] children we are going to heaven
[1:13:58] hallelujah
[1:14:03] only things here
[1:14:04] you the truth will make you honest
[1:14:07] you'll never be popular
[1:14:10] never
[1:14:11] will be just honest
[1:14:14] i always say i said you know what most
[1:14:17] of the time we turned down god
[1:14:20] in the
[1:14:22] family marrying
[1:14:24] when my sister's there my mother
[1:14:27] we were we kicked out of the word of god
[1:14:30] the church today becomes so loose
[1:14:35] i'll be
[1:14:36] sometime with me it happened i told my
[1:14:38] wife i said
[1:14:39] oh god forgive me
[1:14:42] i'm waiting for her to come back home
[1:14:45] she come home
[1:14:48] i was praying just finishing the prayer
[1:14:50] when i just said this is packing i want
[1:14:52] to pray fast to finish and to go to open
[1:14:55] the door to kiss her
[1:15:00] you see it's good but i feel condemned
[1:15:03] one day
[1:15:04] yeah even if you are talking to by then
[1:15:07] the president
[1:15:08] and you are dealing with millions
[1:15:10] because i'm a millionaire don't worry
[1:15:11] i'm gonna give everyone i'm very rich
[1:15:13] don't worry about that
[1:15:15] hallelujah
[1:15:16] glory to god
[1:15:19] [Applause]
[1:15:22] and you are talking to biden the
[1:15:23] president
[1:15:25] and even if she knocked that they told
[1:15:27] you your wife is out there or your wife
[1:15:29] they take her to the hospital you can't
[1:15:31] stop that deal with biden you are going
[1:15:34] to feel nisha because when you miss that
[1:15:36] one finish
[1:15:39] and by then until jesus christ who is
[1:15:41] great
[1:15:46] i say my wife i'm sorry when i'm praying
[1:15:48] when i just see now you do your packing
[1:15:51] and i continue to pray i stop i'll kiss
[1:15:54] you after prayer
[1:15:55] [Music]

[1:16:06] that's what it happened to everybody i
[1:16:08] just want to this one they don't need to
[1:16:09] make you laugh is to everyone we are we
[1:16:13] are going to the same so even when i'm
[1:16:15] preaching i'm preaching to myself
[1:16:18] i'm praying to myself so that's why when
[1:16:20] i'm preparing someone said god forgive
[1:16:22] me me also ah god
[1:16:24] i need the holy spirit yes i need the
[1:16:25] holy spirit now you people sometimes you
[1:16:27] can say oh
[1:16:29] eh
[1:16:30] the holy spirit
[1:16:32] all these years you never spirit it's
[1:16:34] because you don't even start to receive
[1:16:36] it
[1:16:41] someone who is close to god you will
[1:16:44] never feel sufficient it's always
[1:16:45] unsufficient unsufficient unsufficient

[1:17:05] that's why people they they're ashamed
[1:17:07] to come in the front or pray for me
[1:17:10] three years
[1:17:11] and i ask just this boy to pray for me
[1:17:16] ah you are dying there and you are going

[1:17:20] because you are so proud
[1:17:22] and the small boy you've got a gift to
[1:17:24] pray for you
[1:17:25] and you died up to you
[1:17:28] so die
[1:17:29] continue
[1:17:31] believe it
[1:17:33] or not
[1:17:36] praise the lord

[1:17:46] yeah i was off note i'm coming to minot
[1:17:50] praise the lord
[1:17:53] now we are going to talk on the
[1:17:54] desperation
[1:17:56] for a few minutes now
[1:17:58] oh let me please by story
[1:18:00] castle i know he's looking at me he
[1:18:02] didn't finish the story okay let me
[1:18:03] finish all right
[1:18:05] and the babranam look at that rope
[1:18:08] he turned at the left
[1:18:10] channel right
[1:18:12] that girl said what
[1:18:15] can you do that
[1:18:16] no
[1:18:17] i thought you don't have faith but when
[1:18:19] i'm helping me hear it straight away
[1:18:22] faith create it
[1:18:25] so but the burnout
[1:18:27] tried to create atmosphere for head to
[1:18:30] every faith
[1:18:31] to change the attitude
[1:18:34] that's it
[1:18:36] his attitude it was there ready but
[1:18:38] no not though we have too much knowledge
[1:18:41] of the message
[1:18:42] knowledge of the quotation knowledge of
[1:18:45] miracle god did the last year you used
[1:18:48] to be if you today you are not forget
[1:18:51] yes
[1:18:52] we used to be if it used to now okay
[1:18:55] if you are not forget it start again
[1:18:58] when you left jesus
[1:19:00] mary and and joseph when they realized
[1:19:03] after three days a journey they didn't
[1:19:06] have the lord jesus
[1:19:08] and they sphincla said
[1:19:10] can we continue no we have to go back
[1:19:13] they went back again in three days
[1:19:15] to find the way jesus they left them
[1:19:18] if it takes to go to the calvary for you
[1:19:21] to restart again go to the calvary if
[1:19:24] you take for repentance
[1:19:26] go to repentance if you feel you are
[1:19:28] okay let me forgot continue but the
[1:19:31] problem is there is only two people they
[1:19:34] know better than yourself
[1:19:36] it's yourself and the god
[1:19:41] you know you know if you feel something
[1:19:43] you don't have you know
[1:19:45] don't wait someone to tell you i was in
[1:19:47] my office said
[1:19:49] you know you and god because my puppet
[1:19:51] is that one when it's burning she's
[1:19:52] there
[1:19:53] when it's burning
[1:19:55] hey man i mean
[1:19:57] i'm tired now okay we will keep it for
[1:19:59] tomorrow
[1:20:00] continue tomorrow
[1:20:02] because i want her to be right
[1:20:06] before i go and help others
[1:20:09] that's what i believe i didn't choose to
[1:20:11] be a preacher i never like even if to be
[1:20:13] a preacher i always run away you have
[1:20:15] chosen me then papa help my wife
[1:20:19] yeah help my wife and they help me
[1:20:21] because i don't want to tell people what
[1:20:23] i can do to tell you to do
[1:20:26] oh yes that's why it can't be it can i
[1:20:29] help you that's why i can read the i get
[1:20:31] the bible message i bring to my life i
[1:20:33] tell you what he does i tell you my
[1:20:35] wrong i tell why i fix it and we will
[1:20:38] put there god help us all over us
[1:20:42] one day the pastor was preaching he said
[1:20:44] most of the time the hospital will
[1:20:45] preach like us we are holding
[1:20:47] no no
[1:20:48] all of us we are trying all of us we are
[1:20:51] working all of us we are praying all of
[1:20:54] us we want to be changed there is also
[1:20:56] some few stuff i know myself the
[1:20:58] looseness i have to tight up to tight up
[1:21:01] to tighten up to tight up because a full
[1:21:04] surrender to god that's when one so he
[1:21:07] can come to him and heal the people and
[1:21:10] vindicate his word and if myself i'm
[1:21:14] there doesn't manifest full surrender
[1:21:16] it's not brother one it's not a sista
[1:21:18] billah or whatever my brother it's me
[1:21:21] joseph i'm wrong god to come down and
[1:21:25] there to go vindicate one does and the
[1:21:27] miracles don't put in the pasta don't
[1:21:30] put this in the dickons but to yourself
[1:21:34] come on now
[1:21:38] yes
[1:21:39] if you have a desire
[1:21:41] of a revival you must bring a revival
[1:21:44] you are the revival when i have a
[1:21:45] disaster father i am the revival
[1:21:49] from my house
[1:21:52] to work i don't even i don't mention
[1:21:54] here
[1:21:55] here we just come to warm up omar a real
[1:21:57] challenge
[1:21:59] network
[1:22:00] that's where we know a real color of you
[1:22:03] a real color of you is at work you can
[1:22:05] live like you're breathing
[1:22:10] yeah yeah i'm sick you are not sick
[1:22:12] you're fine
[1:22:20] that but human being are so slowful
[1:22:24] in their mind that it takes emergency
[1:22:28] something rises and when they do
[1:22:31] when it throws them into that
[1:22:32] desperation and really in doing that in
[1:22:36] desperation it brings out the that real
[1:22:39] thing that you are
[1:22:41] it show what you made out of
[1:22:44] in time of desperation
[1:22:47] it usually pull out all the good things
[1:22:50] that is you you see so it thinks good is
[1:22:52] in you but it takes a desperation

[1:31:50] nothing from god the word from the bible
[1:31:54] aim is a gift gift and the calling is
[1:31:57] without repentance the devil doesn't
[1:31:59] give a gift is the god give a gift but
[1:32:02] abraham said you have a gift but you
[1:32:04] have to choose who to give to
[1:32:08] the devil he's not a creator he
[1:32:10] doesn't that's why your gift you give to
[1:32:14] who
[1:32:16] praise the lord give to god and the
[1:32:18] anointing come and that gift will be a
[1:32:20] blessing
[1:32:22] those people they give to the devil the
[1:32:24] the hell anointing come to them
[1:32:27] they came from those music
[1:32:29] rock and roll
[1:32:31] nights club all those things when the
[1:32:34] rocker roll they sing they don't even
[1:32:35] think that go and kill
[1:32:37] that anointing from hell
[1:32:39] when they listen to those music they
[1:32:41] took the gun they shoot
[1:32:43] who told them to shoot
[1:32:46] there is the devil there is a sub
[1:32:48] nominal message

[1:33:09] subtle the devil is the preacher the
