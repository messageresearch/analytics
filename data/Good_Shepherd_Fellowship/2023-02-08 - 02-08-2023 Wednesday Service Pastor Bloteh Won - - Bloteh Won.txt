traditional but these days it looks like um I'm beginning to be that kind so tonight we will we just shared a little uh testimony video with you uh this was uh thank you musicians just before we get into the preaching of the word tonight this is February 8. this was the very same uh date that uh the congressman William offshore was healed so I decided to take a portion of of his testimony he's joining to Healing and to use that for the prayer meeting tonight so the the tech team there will play there for us and then right after that we will go into the service tonight Daniel if you cut the light off here place complexible name yeah full of any great distance was not worth the effort foreign 1900s was tough America was rural small farms dotted the landscape where many families struggled to put food on the table [Music] of any great distance was not worth the effort and medicine was nowhere near where it is today when William Upshaw was 18 years old he fell and broke his spine being an invalid is never an easy life but being an invalid at the turn of the century was one of the worst Fates anyone could imagine at just 18 years old William Upshaw had to come to terms with the fact that he may never walk again he spent the next seven years of his life in bed eventually by the grace of God he learned to walk again with the help of his little buddies a set of wooden crutches that were always by his side he still faced terrible challenges every day but the Inner Strength he built during the past seven years kept him moving forward William would become famous for his phrases let nothing discourage you never give up and God will heal me it just isn't time yet William Upshaw grew in faith and character over the years he wrote multiple books and eventually became a United States Congressman representing the state of Georgia his strong stance against the evils of alcohol became his Battle Cry he stood boldly for God and soon the Lord Jesus would come on the scene and completely deliver him of his injury [Music] on February 8 1951 brother Branham held a series of meetings at Calvary Temple in Los Angeles on the closing night of the meetings in a vision brother Branham saw a stack of hay materialized in front of him as he watched it he saw a young man fall and severely hurt himself as the vision began to reveal the man's life brother Branham realized that same man was sitting in the congregation it was Congressman Upshaw go tell the congressman that God has healed him brother Branham boldly proclaimed Congressman Upshaw believed and he immediately stood up he never used his little buddies again seen all about it began to speak now I couldn't tell and I told Mr Baxter a few moments had failed I seen where the man was setting I see it was in seen get hurt when he was just a little boy and they've been a for all and I started to leave and uh the spirit of God began to fall and a woman had raised out of a wheelchair and some more things that ten place for the Spirit revealing to them and as I started Mr cup here the brother caught the pastor no then I said go tell the congressman that God has healed he might see me going walking away Jerry would you stand up Congressman just so that people could see you here he is a congressman of the United States of America that was a 66 here God bless you my brother here for the eight of Warriors young state three and four times a day preach the gospel of the Christ who saved me stood by me on bed seven years and made me happy and then took me over the crutches that I had used for 59 years [Music] praise the Lord [Music] foreign God lived tonight amen let's stand on our feet and now praise the Lord he's the same yesterday and forever let's turn to the book of Kings second king that will be second king chapter eight that will be second Kings chapter 8. thank you sister Annette for helping the team back there praise the Lord be in the prayer meeting tonight uh let's read from verse let's read from verse one second king chapter eight read it from verse one then speak Elijah onto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go and go down and the household in in sojourn wheresoever that I can sojourn for the Lord have called for a farming and eight shall also come to pass and and sorry and it and it shall also come upon the land seven years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and saw John into the land of the Philistines seven years and he came to pass at the seven year end the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry onto the king for her house and for her Lane praise the Lord and the King talked with gehazer the seven of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha have done and he came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her Lane and geheisa said my Lord O King this is the woman and this is her son whom Elijah restored to life let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just want to thank you and we want to appreciate you lord god father and you could remind us Lord father to to take this even that have taken place Lord father on this very same soul lord God many years ago uh this testimony hang in the U.S Congress it hangs around the word of Father these were not things that were that took place in the shadow these were things that took place father Lord on the the commission you gave to your seven you said he would pray for kings and great men and their lord we want to thank you Father the Lord God we can identify with what you have done was speaking to the king year was a living testimony of what the prophet have done so father we pray that Lord you will just bless the little portion of your word that we have read tonight come and encourage our hearts Lord to you be the praise to you be the glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat tonight praise the Lord and we would just I want to thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to be in the house of the Lord tonight and uh that we can Fellowship around the word of God praise the Lord now I I was I was uh I was steady when I came across uh uh that and then a kind of a look at the date I said well okay it's it's a good timing we can be able to fit that into our calendar for this year praise the Lord and uh a few of few of that also we will We Will We would like to to look at as we as we go through the year now the reason did is that we have to remind ourselves you know we have to remind ourselves I was listening to bird brand preaching Town testing Memorial you look in the scripture you see that God uh love to remind his people he said that's what the Holy Ghost would do it will remind us it will bring back to our membrane so you see through the scripture how God told his people to uh you know to build to build monuments so they can be able to remind themselves look back God told them there uh after they came through the Jordan that he should build a memorial so tomorrow they can point to the memorial and and you know and remind their children tell their children that these you know these rocks came from that River we passed through the river and we took those rocks from there and we planted it here praise the Lord amen so God loved memoriam Allelujah now so uh uh we we ought to remind ourselves you know of of those things uh we are not believing cunning device people of men these are not stories that are just made up of men and uh and you will you will realize that if you studied the message you will find out that uh uh ah those days of the Revival there were I was I was listening out no I have a book that I was reading of of a man that followed the the healing Revival around the U.S he was he was kind of for a photojournalist and uh I think his background was either from from either the Baptists or Methodist Church and in those days there were there were healing tents you know tense Revival all around the country and uh and he said uh his uh you know his parents you know they would tell them that those peoples in those tense Revival they were calling Spirits you know so they'll never go down there you know those people they are they're always you know out there invoking spirits and all sorts of that so so out of fear he was creeping you know to go and see what was happening and that's how he got he got caught up in following the Revival meetings until he came to Warner Brother Brandon meeting and then he got stuck behind brother Branham services and uh and uh so uh those were things that were happening they were they were they were very common around the U.S around that time they were very common they were all over the place there were people that was driving from as far as Minneapolis to go over to Georgia or Alabama or down in the South or uh where where these meetings are happening praise the Lord now so uh uh uh I'm just I'm saying this to to just kind of fall wake up our spirit a little bit and remind ourselves that uh these uh living testimonies praise the Lord these are living testimonies and and with all of those uh movement especially with uh the Pentecostal movement the healing revivals and uh after the period of time you know uh when Whenever there is a movement that is pulling you know hundreds of people together uh uh the the the the the the U.S uh Security Agency become somehow uh sensitive they like to see what is happening you know in all of these Gathering that are happening around around the country so you will even see on tape where the uh there were times where there were some men that posted themselves as as FBI trying to read into brother Brandon meeting and there was sometimes where truthfully there were FBI that was reading into brother Brandon meeting so you see the uh this this the the the the message has been followed you know it has been watched praise the Lord it has been watched to see what uh uh you know what what what is really behind this we have to realize that uh it was it was right in this very sin Lane you know uh uh Joseph Smith rolls up with a bunch of followers you know Mamas and and a lot of the things that documents upon documents and reports and files that have been presented to uh to to the FBI of things that were done and different movements that have taken place around the country praise the Lord so you see uh uh I'm I'm saying all of this uh you know uh to uh for us to realize that uh uh you know uh we we have to be true to what we are called you know to believe amen we have to be true this yeah yes because this is not just you know playing church or joining church or or some kind of uh Movement we can be in for that setting x amount of years this is our life praise the Lord this is our life now so just like we read in uh in the in the scripture tonight we we would like to take uh uh a little uh talk from there and encourage us tonight uh you know I was I was thinking on that trying to make comparison you know uh so I went through a couple of different different videos and I saw that one from lifeline and I thought that okay this this is a good pull together so we can just use it before the prayer meeting time goes up the Bible says Elijah hey life was a man of like passion Just Like Us Praise the Lord now realize in the story that we have just read on the every Elijah Ministry when Elijah the tishback came there was a time of farming praise the Lord now uh second king chapter eight where we read this was Elijah the one that took over from Elijah praise the Lord so honor every Elijah Ministry there there are things that we can identify that took place uh on the on the uh that Ministry because we know that uh God spoke through his word and we know we are very familiar with faith how God used the spirit of Elijah five times four now and one is going to go back to Israel Revelation chapter 11. so uh uh we see that when Elijah the tishback came we don't have a lot of history from where he came from but we know he was a man of the wilderness praise the Lord and he came in such a time you know he came in such a time and uh uh uh era what you what we were talking about driving the last time about those stones I was I was looking at it it was it was a very very interesting thought it was very interesting because what came to my mind is that um uh uh talking about memoriam we were just we were looking at the book of uh uh Joshua and he was sharing with me the brother you know uh reminded him about the monument that was made after the crossing of the rare sea now Joshua asked him to make uh gather stones in the middle of Jordan and he also told them to gather Stones outside of Jordan so there were two monuments that were that were male that were put together now where it where it dropped my mind because when Elijah came on the scene the Bible make us to realize that he came to rebuild the altar of the Lord praise the Lord then they kind of forgot my mind because I was I was now thinking you know uh he never went over to the the Temple of Solomon to rebuild their altar he built the altar by taking 12 Stones and there was the same instruction that Joshua gave to the men that came through the Jordan that they should take a stone for each tribe to be able to build that Monument praise the Lord amen so in in the period of time from the time of Joshua all down to the time of the Kings you will realize that that alter has disappeared whether it was destroyed whether it was despised whatever it is you will find that that uh uh the the the ministry of Elijah now uh was uh building rebuilding the Altar and their altar now will restore the house of the people praise the Lord because there was Elijah Ministry to restore the house of the people so right there in the first king chapter 17 18 you will see Elijah is saying Lord let these people know that I have done everything according to your word and let this thing that I've done be what that will restore their heart back praise the Lord so he's doing everything according to the word because it will be the word that will restore the house of the people back praise the Lord amen so but then we realize that under that first Elijah Ministry there was a farming Elijah said there would be no rain neither do you until I call for it praise the Lord amen and we know that that took place exactly now we are seeing on the Elisha Ministry which of course here that we know that the spirit of of uh of Elijah Came Upon Elisha when he put his matter on him he took the ministry of Elijah now we see now in the on the his ministry also here is another time of farming seven years praise the Lord at seven years of farming now then uh uh Eli Elijah yeah now it is instructing this woman to uh you know go away take your household go to the land you know or the Philistine your entire house you know you go and take care of your family there just going to be farming in the land and now when she comes back to the Lane she realized that she has lost everything praise the Lord now I realized that she went out on the the prophet instruction praise the Lord going out and uh you know uh not not uh knowing exactly where she's going now but she's she's going to to the neighboring country to go and uh and glean for her family to your husband her son now on her return she had lost her Lane she had lost her house everything that she has praise the Lord amen now so what a Time what a time to come back now she came back if you if you look at the story closely uh uh you know she never came back to Elijah or Elisha complaining oh man I was gone in my in my house and my Landing I've lost everything praise the Lord she never did that she came back and Yara says she's trying to find her way to go to the king and trying to find a way to talk to the king that everything that she lost can be restored back to her praise the Lord she lost her land she lost all Hall her property and as she comes back to the King house trying to find her way maybe talking to one of the guys you know this is where I live you know I I came back and uh you know everything is gone I don't even have a place to make farm I don't have land and everything she's she's trying to find her way can can can can you please you give my name to the king or can you please uh find a way that I can sit down with the King and all of that at the very time that she she got back there and uh the scripture this year making us to to realize that uh the King has sent for gehiza the seven of of the prophet to come and sit down with him and and and and come and tell me tell me some of the great things that God had done under your Prophet Ministry praise the Lord tell me some of the great things tell me some of the things that you have seen praise the Lord and he's talking about uh I mean uh I think he could even go back to talk about the Days of Elijah he could go back and talk about when the prophet asked that God shall open his eyes and and the angels that he saw on the mountain and he's talking all of those things you know and then sometimes when you hear those things they sound like feebos they can sound like make up stories praise the Lord amen they can sound like make up stories I was just uh driving to church tonight and I will also playing uh Rosella Griffin uh on a testimony she was testifying you know uh uh how she struggled on the uh uh uh being an addict you know alcohol until the grace of God came down and and someone took her to brother Brandon meeting and she came right there you know when and brotherbraham lay her head lay his hands on her and and cast that that uh drinking Spirit off of her and she never put another alcohol on her leg for the rest of her life praise the Lord amen you yeah we you hear about speaking Scholars into existence the raising of the the the little fish and you you hear about uh uh uh uh you know uh brother Brandon did in in her White House and giving giving her boys back to her the head around I give you your son and the Holy Spirit struck those two boys down there and they gave their heart to the Lord we hear all of these stories they looked like feeble and I believe that is the same condition where that King was sitting he was just not in his head yeah yeah oh wow oh really praise the Lord and right there here is a woman trying to squeeze her way in and and find her way over to the king and he says and one time you know what uh there was a lady in this set it out so nice to us and uh you know what uh uh uh and and her son died really praise the Lord and that man of God just went right down there you know while and and and and and he prayed for the boy and the boy came back to life really that damn boy raised back to life right at that time the woman broke through the crowd praise the Lord right at that time she broke through the crowd and get his I says here is the woman I'm telling you about and here is the boy now another woman but here is the boy that came back to life praise the Lord now you can think about it now you think about it in your mind this is not just a street person this was a man that was a congressman a man that reigned for president praise the Lord so wish me his his his name is noon every word he's a public servant praise the Lord and he was a Baptist above the preacher he was a Baptist preacher the only reason why they never vote him because he was very high on alcohol yeah he was very strong on on Whiskey praise the Lord so being about to preacher he and Roy Davis Rod Davis was brother Branham pastor because brother Branham came through the Baptist rank praise the Lord and now you have to remember now brother Bannon being a young preacher preaching on the Royal Davis and Yara said he's telling Rod Davis of the vision in all of these things and uh and and and and and the old man was not I mean he was just thinking this boy every time he's coming he's coming with some kind of a dream and every time he's coming in he says uh you know what uh uh uh some something spoke to him do not smoke do not drink do not defy your body you know uh uh uh he loved brother Brandon but uh uh uh realizing where he took uh uh uh William Branham from now being educated you know and and with the kind of a rough life that he had and you ever said here that he's telling him that an angel is telling him that he's going to pray for sick and great men and all of that you know and and and so and and he he was he was very uh uh uh you know he was trying to be careful not to discourage the Young The Young preacher but he also was not really believing because there was not there was not a lot of Divine Healing you know in uh in in among the Baptist people at around that time so uh and and we know the story brother Brandon would not have been ordained a woman preacher that's how he and Rod David went separate ways and uh uh uh but they kept their friendship you know brother Brandon respected him you know better Brandon would talk highly of Rod Davis you know he said Rod Davis was a lawyer by profession praise the Lord so the first night he would allowed brother Branham to preach Birdman came preaching you know as a young preacher and uh you know he's uh he's uh trying to encourage the people and you know he preacher Lazarus you know in uh uh uh and the beggar you know and then he's uh you know better brand going through the scripture and he's saying uh you know uh trying it's hard to put out his message you know and uh and he went down to Hell and he cried there was no mother there and he cried and if you don't give your life to Jesus you were crying you know and you know brother Brian doing his best and pouring out his heart he said after he got through preaching you know uh uh and and you know and people you know people God touching you know and it started crying and and all of that and people uh you know all uh Billy that was a good salmon you know and in north of Daddy and then he came he made his pastor and uh for us oh man that was one of the horrible message I've ever heard praise the Lord but bam said he just tear me into pieces he says he says he says he says Billy you know uh uh and then he was now speaking in the sense of a lawyer now he says that uh you know uh you uh you are you are standing there as as an attorney for the people as a mediator you know you have to you have to carry convincing statement you don't go play on people's sympathy you know don't play on people sympathy well you gotta you got to carry convincing statement you know praise the Lord and and I think that's a good one amen praise the Lord you got to be convenient you got to take it from the scripture don't come and tell people you know your mother used to be a good member of this church you know and uh and you know I mean don't you don't play it on people sympathy so he nailed brother random on that praise the Lord but when they are separate ways and you know when brother Brandon respected Roy Davis if you look through the message you will see how he hardly speak about that man now one wrong thing he said he will only tell your word the differ but he respected his Pastor now uh but then as time goes by there were a lot of testimonies of the different people that brother Brandon has prayed for until there was someone that was sick in brother Royal David's Church and he called brother Branham he said Bella will you come and pray and brother Brandon prayed and and yeah and and the man got healed so it was a witness before Rod Davis Eyes praise the Lord so when they went to the Baptist's uh convention that was where uh William Arthur met Rod Davis and then uh you know in Royal Davis told him about brother Brandon praise the Lord and encourage him to go to Warner Brother Brandon's meeting praise the Lord and he took her he took the offer and he choose to go to the meeting praise the Lord amen I have I have some other pictures there I never had time to to send them back there but I mean some of them were right in the in a short video that we watched tonight so they were just going to be repetition of pictures so uh I mean he went to the meeting and he I mean he saw what what the Lord was doing you know healing the people and all of that you know so uh uh uh I'm just I'm just I'm just trying to encourage our faith tonight you know uh and and let us know that uh I mean uh we uh we are following fulfilled scripture praise the Lord we now following the man We are following fulfilled scripture because God will always fulfill his word in you and me praise the Lord amen and if we and if we dedicate our life if we if we consecrate our life and your life can be a testimony to someone praise the Lord and the person gave their life to Christ the person is not following you they are following the word that was fulfilled in your life praise the Lord now following the word because it's only the word the spoken word of God will be able to bring forth of his kind praise the Lord anything that is not God's word I mean uh it will not be able to reproduce itself so that's what I wanted for us to see tonight this is one I mean and we can we can we can read testimony and and play testimony but I mean uh I I choose this one one because this uh this was this happened on the 8th of February but one of the the uh another reason is there because of the rank of the individual praise the Lord if it was fake it would be a big issue praise the Lord if he was a lying wonders it would be a big issue praise the Lord just like uh uh the pillow fire picture that brother uh Freddie referred to there on Sunday and uh it's it's just the same it was it was examined by the FBI and it hangs in there in uh Washington DC praise the Lord are we together so Elijah said this is a prayer media I won't keep you too long Elijah said that uh this is the woman and this is the boy that was raised from life I mean raised from the dead back to life sorry and uh and the scripture says right there the woman was able to put her supplication before the king and everything that she lost praise the Lord so you see another thing that is attached to the ministry of Elijah is restoration praise the Lord everything that she lost was restored she lost her son to death God restored him back she lost her house God restored it back she lost her land god restored it back praise the Lord before I send you Elijah the prophet before the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord he would turn the house of the father to the children The House of the the children back to the father Lisa come and smash the Earth with her curse praise the Lord this is not calling device feeble this is not a thing that is just put together by men this is the hand of God praise the Lord this is the hand of God I will close with this Let's uh let's take our Bibles sent tonight is a prayer meeting night I don't remember the service on Saturday it would be a city that uh 637 with a brother Eric Peterson from South Africa do you fly in on Friday you pray for us Saturday night and Sunday morning so let's come and support the meetings and uh I'm sure you'll be blessed praise the Lord Exodus chapter 8. Exodus chapter 8. you know people have turned uh to social media to complain about what they don't like about the message and what they don't like it I mean you should be able to uh like like I told someone I say Sir if uh William Brandon was wrong in his teaching I believe that that God maybe might have just honored him because he was he was Earnest and dedicated to what he believed yeah praise the Lord amen but the thing there is that we have to ask ourselves what have we done for the Lord praise the Lord if a boy with a seventh grade education and a poor background that he came from who influence the word who influenced the word what have we done just just forget about the whole word you don't have to do anything for the whole word what have you done for your siblings your neighbors your friends what influence have you done praise the Lord so why why go what waste your energy to fight against someone that only try to help people to live right praise the Lord amen una tried to help people to live right to do what is right oh he were high on women praise the Lord amen and uh we we started something uh Sunday night I'm coming back today I'm coming back to that whole design thing I've been working on it praise the Lord amen and I and I and I think uh uh uh [Music] uh you know so I mean just like I'm saying this is just to encourage you tonight praise the Lord is to encourage you you have to yeah I mean just just don't don't follow the message don't just follow you got to believe it this thing is giving to be our life it's not giving to follow exhaust your doubt when the when the Queen of Sheba came to meet Solomon praise the Lord everything that she heard that Solomon could do the doubts that she had she came and she exhausted her doubt she asked her question she asked her critical question ask your critical question while this is done why why we preach this ask your critical question just don't follow because the day you don't see the one you are following you won't know where to go praise the Lord the day you don't see the one you are following you will not know where to go because you're just following exhaust your questions your doubts because the dissolvers of Doubt is here he will dissolve all your doubts he will take away your fear there's nothing to be afraid of are we together okay I'm left with several meetings I can do it Exodus chapter 8. Exodus chapter eight let's look at verse 19. that's what my note said now this is pharaoh and and uh and and uh you know in in uh and his magician Moses before Pharaoh here the Bible says then the magician said unto Pharaoh this is the Finger of God praise the Lord what they were seeing amen when Moses came he threw his rod down they throw their own down you know uh uh you know I mean he threw his raw down they tend to to snake they could throw they asked their home that's cheap magician cheap Magic praise the Lord Hallelujah but yet his cheap magic ate their own praise the Lord and then after the next one the the you know when uh when when the frogs and and the fleas and all of that started coming this is their own testimony telling Pharaoh this is the finger of God praise the Lord amen Exodus chapter 31. I'm uh kind of full Y into a message I wanted to preach called The Finger of God so I'm I'm kind of for the exhausting my my notes but that's fine praise the Lord let's look at Verse 18 the last verse there Exodus 1 verse 18. and he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of communion with him upon Mount Santa table of testimony tables of sun written wave the Finger of God praise the Lord the same finger that wrote The Commandments were the same finger that did that brought the Plex on Egypt are we together Luke chapter 11. the same finger that wrote The Commandments was the same finger that wrote on the wall of Babylon before battery charger the same finger that wrote The Commandments was the same finger that was writing on the same praise the Lord when those Pharisees caught that woman in adultery they met the same finger writing in the scene Luke chapter 11. we're close with this are we together to you now here look uh he he recorded a testimony here of were these uh you know Pharisees talking to Jesus and calling him decibel and Jesus will say to them uh I said Luke 11 as that is in uh okay sorry I see why I'm I'm reading the same story from Matthew so I'm kind of looking the wrong place Matthew chapter 12. is where that came from but let's look in Luke it's Luke 11 that I want to I want to look at Luke 11. let me find my verse and make sure that uh Jesus said in verse 19 but if I by basketball cast out devil by whom do your sons cast them out therefore Shah they be your judge but if I with the Finger of God cast out devil no doubt the kingdom of God is calm praise the Lord amen so the same finger that brought the plagues the magician identified what was happening in Egypt as the Finger of God we can fight against this this is the Finger of God praise the Lord Moses testified to us that the the tablets The Ten Commandments were written by the Finger of God praise the Lord Jesus is testifying here in this gospel that he cast out Spirit by the Finger of God praise the Lord amen you know when brother bam talks about that he says uh he says uh and and that's how he rescued us you know when he pick you up from sin he pick you up by the Finger of God praise the Lord I got sure I can remember he just grabbed me by the ear just like this the Finger of God grabbed me by the ear and just pulled me out I don't know how he grabbed you but that was how he got me praise the Lord now this is just like I said this is just to encourage us the same word that spoke this word into existence that's the same word we are fellowshipping around the same word that that designed the universe the word of God that designed the universe praise the Lord don't underestimate the word of God there is nothing that we are dealing with no situation in our life that is greater than this word this word has the changing power to change our life and for the mother of Father the prophet of God said is changing the atoms of our body is changing the atoms of our body so this word is in our bloodstream it's in our bloodstream it can it can heal our sickness it can break our habits it can deliver us they can change our life praise the Lord if you please God to heal a man after 66 years after 66 years broke his back when he was 18 years got healed when he was 84 years that's him God Can Heal Your Life they are saying God can deliver you that same God can change your situation praise the Lord William offshore said I know I will be healed it's just a matter of time and you can say the same thing to all I know I will be changed it's just a matter of time less Bible
