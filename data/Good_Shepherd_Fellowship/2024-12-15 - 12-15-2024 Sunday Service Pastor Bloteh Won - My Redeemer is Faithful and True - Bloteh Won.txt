our soul will understand in the name of the Lord Jesus we thank you Father we thank you Lord we thank you in Jesus name amen amen thank you musicians thank you praise the Lord and uh glory be to God let's take our Bibles uh Exodus chapter 3 Exodus chapter 3 we were speaking about the Redeemer in his Redemption you cannot have a Redemption without the Redeemer amen Redemption will never be Carri out without the Redeemer in it the Redeemer has to be in his Redemption praise the Lord God did not made a Plan of Redemption and give it to us for us to carry it out no praise the Lord that's the reason why we cannot save anybody we cannot heal anybody we cannot deliver anybody we can't do that praise the Lord because it's not our work we are only the benefactors of redemption praise the Lord so the one that makes the Plan of Redemption he always comes down to do the work of redemption praise the Lord that's that is that is the reality that we want we want to uh bring to you there cannot be a Redemption no matter what you are wanting to redeem until the Redeemer comes down amen without the Redeemer there will be no Redemption Exodus chapter 3 praise the Lord let's let's read and uh uh uh and and again uh we want to thank you for praying for us uh like like I said we are back home in our home and uh it's been about uh um over 6 months we've been out of out of out of our house uh uh since Easter we we are back home and uh uh we've been camping back home and then Christmas came very early for us there a lot of boxes all over the house amen we've been opening boxes Christmas came too early and with bunch of old Stars amen praise the Lord so thank you thank you for your prayers amen Exodus chapter 3 now Moses kept the flood of Jetro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to herob and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire praise the Lord out in the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight while the bush is not burned and when the Lord saw that he turned as side to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I praise the Lord and he said draw not night hither put off thy shoes from of thy feet for the place where on thou standeth is Holy Ground amen moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I've have heard their Cry by reason of their Tax Masters for I know their sorrow and I am come down I am come down take off your shoes I am come down praise the Lord I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptian and to bring them up out of the land onto a good land and a large onto a land land floing with milk and honey onto the place of the Canaanites the haites the amorites the perizzites the havit and the jebusites praise the Lord amen let's pray together father we just want to thank you we still have the privilege to be able to read from your sacred word oh god father Lord we know the word has been kicked out in many places Lord Jesus and one of these days so father Lord God just like it was in time of old all men will have to give their life for this word while we have the privilege give us the grace oh Father to make the best use oh God because you actually want to write your word on the table of our hearts also we pray to God father this morning we place ourself before you speak to us come out of the pages of your word make yourself rear to us we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat good to see you thank you praise the Lord amen amen amen amen there are two things I want to make an emphasis on and I want us to look at uh very closely as we look at uh as we talk about Redemption this morning and uh uh God told Moses I would just go right into what I want to say I don't know I have much time this morning and uh uh he says I I and I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptian god came down and and and God really me it when he said he have come down praise the Lord amen and uh uh we want to we want to pay attention to this in the scripture we look at few places in the scripture yes God taking telling Moses take off your shoes for the place where you stand it is a Holy Ground there is a lot of significance there a lot of religion has copied that to be able to think that going in the presence of the Lord you have to take off your shoes now that that begins the order of approach because even in the Tabernacle the priest never W shoes it was the beginning of the order of approach when God told Moses take off your shoes and uh uh but there is there is more to that there is more to that that we want to look at this morning by the help of the Lord is is it's a Redemption language retake of your sh choose is a Redemption language because we we we saw that also in uh uh in the Book of Ruth uh uh the king's man kicking off his shoes so it's a Redemption language that's why we want to look into this morning by the help of the Lord but when we first spoke on this we we we use uh uh uh the exposition of the church ages the laa Church age where God's Prophet spoke about these things said the faithful and Tru witness so he was trying to bring a sense of faithfulness to us what faithfulness is When God Says I Am the faithful and Truth witness he said now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful the thought of faithful when God say he's faithful praise the Lord amen we use the word are being faithful our faithfulness is condition men faithfulness is condition but God's faithfulness is unconditional praise the lord we didn't pay money to W be wake up this morning he woke us up praise the Lord amen and uh uh uh I mean his faithfulness is is is uh uncondition praise the Lord like we said over and over then remind ourself the love of God for you and even the Sinners on the street is the same God don't have partiality in his love we change it we condition it praise the Lord we we have had the opportunity to receive his love to believe that he loved us and some don't believe some look at situation around their life and don't believe but yet you can you can you can still believe in your in your illness or in uh uh being broker being in trouble you can still believe that God love you you can believe it it's the grace that been given to you so so we make the difference it is not God he's not passioned in his love the Bible says for God so love the word he so L the word the entire word are we together so God faithfulness is is unconditional and that's what he's trying to teach us here I want to show you what kind of of uh what kind in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about the great unchanging God whose words does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seems very impersonal we think about his goodness but we take his person out of it we say God is good we says uh you know uh the Lord is good and uh you know he's being so good he woke me up this morning praise the Lord and many times is just a thought in our mind with the absent of his person we make him very very uh uh uh impersonal when when we when we talk about his greatness but not so praise the morning praise the Lord what what I I want to say is that this morning God in his Mercy came down and whisper in every one of your ears to wake you up he took his own precious time amen and kiss you on the cheek his goodness is is is is not without his person if God has been good let me tell you every mortar every mortar living on Earth is giving the opportunity to experience God in person even the ones that don't believe God they will always come back and says that uh uh uh uh it has to be God that thing that happen it had to be God there is something that will happen that will bring a man very close to the invisible God so God goodness and his greatness is not without his person praise the Lord remember Believers he said I will never leave leave you that's what he said I will never leave you I will not forsake you that's what he said and he mean it God just don't give you Grace and say I give you my grace go go no no no no he gave Grace and he follow his grace when he gave Mercy he follow his mercy so what what what the prophet of God is trying to do is to is to make us be a word to conscientise us of his presence of his presence are we together and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became and became a great imp personal God praise the Lord he just put the moons the star put everything dead and then he just he just sit on his throne and for his hands no no you see that's that like I said on Wednesday night that is the Paradox the Paradox is not the result the Paradox is the intelligence that brings the result how he manage it amen the intelligence behind it that brings the result is the Paradox it's not the result are we together let's just Fellowship around this a little bit it is as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then when the death of Christ has has atoned for sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God just F his arm and sto back you know he paid the price it's almost like okay I finished paying the price for you I've done what I'm supposed to do I leave it with you nope you cannot take a redeemer out of redemption you don't have Redemption you don't have Redemption you can't take the Savior out of Salvation you don't have salvation you cannot take the Healer out of healing you don't have healing for you to have healing the Healer has to be there for you to be saved the Savior have to be on the scene for you to be redeemed the Redeemer have to step down are we together praise the Lord that's the picture that's the picture we want to we we we trying to set for this morning and uh uh so you can grab it because that is the thing that is weakening our faith that is the thing that is killing the church because the church has put God behind the clouds his way in heaven we are here to manage amen we here to make the rules we here to tell you how you should do it when the first man was lost God never sent an angel it was God that was going in the garden Adam Adam where are you he didn't send an angel If He Did It for the first man he would do it for every lost son and daughter of God praise the Lord he might borrow some body to use but if you will ever come out safe it will have to be God on the same are we together even for his hand and just stood back it is it is as if we we we measure in believing in a great Creator who having who having created lost personal interest in his creat creation because that's what the atheist will say where is God all of these things are happening where is God praise the Lord you see the reason why it don't trouble us because he told us in his word it was going to happen praise the Lord if we if you are reading the word you will not be troubled about the wars and the and the earthquakes and everything that is happening because he said it in his word he said it hundreds of years praise the Lord that that shows that he's in control it shows that he's in control if I tell you when you get to your house when you leave this church this morning you get to your house you will see everything in your house parked before on the street you never left it like that and I tell you that by the end of this service before you get to your house you see a lot of people crying around your things they are doing uh uh uh garage sale praise the Lord amen and you get to your house you see them having garage sale you realized that there is an intelligence that is greater than you because you never left your home like that are we together so uh I mean uh uh uh uh let's let's let's not feed into the into the thought of the uh agnostics and in eight years why are these things happening why are these things when you if you are in the word you will know praise the Lord and because he said it are we together now I say that is how too many people are able to think but that is wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men Right Now Praise the Lord he's governing in the Affairs of men right now by his great intelligence he has set your heartbeat your paws by his great intelligence whatever you ate this morning he has designed your body inner system to break their food and distribute energy to your brain your hand everything so he's govering in the Affairs of men Right Now Praise the Lord if it gets so dark it gets black it becomes so Troublesome and if your faith can see God you must believe he's there praise the Lord you must believe that he's there and he's in control love the Lord for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now he's both Creator and and sustainer amen he's both Creator and sustainer God told Moses take off your shoes for the place where you stand on is a Holy Ground you know over and over uh uh uh brother bam used this and it sound like a joke but when you look at it really you realize it's not a joke listen to this he said what is in your hand he says God spoke to him and said Moses take off your shoes for the ground you are standing is a Holy Ground now what if Moses said Lord just a little bit of trouble for me to do that so I would just take off my heart God didn't say take off your heart he said take off your shoes praise the Lord amen you realize that when you look into that you will see that God wanted to bring Moses in contact with his reality praise the Lord amen he wanted to bring Moses in contact with his reality the Earth is your reality that's where your body is taken from are we together we will deal with that more but then just like I said it's a Redemption language it's a Redemption language and is going to set the order of approach to worship what was the language what was God telling Moses God was telling Moses I'm going to step in your shoes praise the Lord take off your shoes I'm going to step in your shoes I'm going to come down that's what he said and I will step in your shoes that's what you said when you said I mean you're not in my shoes you use that all the time you tell somebody you're not in my shoes it does not mean that the person is wearing your shoes it means that you are not feeling what I'm feeling you don't know what I'm going through so it's a Redemption language when he told Moses take off your shoes I'm going to come down are we together now so you will realize that uh uh God was about to step in his place he was about to step in his shoes that word shoes could mean position it could mean place it could mean a condition amen when you tell somebody you're not in my shoes it could mean a condition I'm going through a certain condition so God was going to step into Moses shoes why because he said I have heard the Cry of the people amen I have felt their Affliction and I'm come down praise the Lord so God was about to be identify with their reality he was about to identify himself with the things that they were going through so he said I am calm down but if I come down I need a shoes to wear praise the Lord Egypt is too dead for my feet I need a shoes to wear so Moses take off your shoes glory be to God you love the Lord hey amen they set they set uh uh a symbol for calling you realize you go over in Leviticus chapter 14 you will see that uh when the priest will make an offering for sin there were two things he would use the blood and the oil he was supposed to anoint his eyes the things he will see he was supposed to anoint his Tong that representing the things he would touch and you are also supposed to anoint his big toe on the right foot praise the Lord stif fireing the place that he will step are we together amen he canot foret an other in the sense Israel approached that way not having the full Revelation every time the priest comes to the the the the the the the temple or the Tabernacle he go to the lav and he wash his feet and he take off his Sanders and he goes now the precedent that God was setting for the Tabernacle is that he was the one making offering to himself praise the Lord he was the one making offering to himself praise the Lord amen God has to believe his word in you he has to praise himself in you if it is left with you alone you will just dance to the music and satisfy your emotion but when it comes to worship the spirit of God has to drop down on you to bring Praises back to God he has to step in your shoes for you to bring true worship God was setting the precedent that he was the one because this man that is a priest is as much as a sinner like all the people that that were outside of the Tabernacle so how can a sinner stand in a place for for Sinners so he has to take off his shoes signifying that almighty God was going to take the offering of the people and use a man and present it to himself that's why he told Mary don't touch me I have to go and present myself to the father praise the Lord he was set in and other do you realize one of the most powerful significance in the 40 days walk in the wilderness the Bible says their shoes never were out 40 years using the same Sanders speaking of divine provision Divine provision praise the Lord are you seeing the picture for I am come down I've heard the Affliction of my people and I am come down to deliver them that's what he said but he's going to set something very symbolic that would be overlooked praise the Lord and that's why brother brand says God never told Moses give me your heart because it could speak of intelligence it could speak of your smartness but he took the most least place the place that contacts you with your reality praise the Lord it was also represented o uh uh uh in in the Book of Ruth that was boas's marriage license amen that was his marriage license that the man that was the most nearest King had to kick off his shoes when he kick off his shoes what does that mean boa will step in his shoes because he was the man that was more close to redeem now I'm in Ruth and because he was now worthy to do it he has to remove his shoes publicly to show that there is another man that is stepping in his shoes praise the Lord I believe that that's what almighty God did when when when he met Moses he the Bible says the angel of the Lord get on the bush and it it just created a blazing fire and and and you know and he called all the Heavenly all the Angels were looking around and saying what what what is he going to do what a sight and he got Moses think about it you just think about it the Bible says he called Moses and said Moses Moses and he says yeah I Am Lord how did he know are we together oh people there are a lot of things there are a lot of things in our reality that was boas's marriage license John the Baptist used dead he says I'm not even walking to remove the lashes from his Sanders his shoes describing the kind of a m uh uh uh uh Ministry he had that's why he says I must decrease for him to increase Jesus Will simplify that in St John 13 when he would give get on his knees and wash the disciples feet he said what I do to you now you don't know praise the Lord amen he will get down on his knees get himself with a towel and he will grab their feet and he will wash their feet it's a Redemption language you have to remember that praise the Lord you love the Lord so you will see that over over time because that was done uh uh uh Moses was the one that experienced that I believe with such an experience it left it left so much impression on him that every time he would talk to God he would take off his shoes it became a kind of a h order a kind of approach to God and and and and you see and sometimes that's the way it is God will do some things and then uh uh we will we will partially understand understand it and then we would take it to be a statue or we take it to be an other but he means more to that amen so you see over and over like I said it was done in the Tabernacle you can you can look at a verse here that 2 Samuel chapter 15:30 you look at that uh the Bible says and David went up by the as of the Mount Olive and he wept as he went up and uh and had had his head covered and he went up barefooted and all the people was with him covered their head and and and you and you know and they were weeping and so that became a kind of approach uh uh to worship you know uh and uh and even and even uh uh uh there were other other group of people that take that the Muslims take that as worship and um I think the the Buddhist different people you know they take coming into uh a sacri place or coming into a place of worship you know uh you have to take off your shoes you know uh uh and and and uh uh uh uh most people especially uh a little bit that I I Year from the Muslim why they do that they said because your feet takes all the dirt you know your feet is the most deadest thing because they walk on the Earth but that's your reality you know if they will only realize that that is your reality so I mean over and over you see that through the scripture you see that through the scripture we can run you through here but uh it will it will take us a lot of lot of our time and uh uh and and take us away from what we want to bring to you so God didn't say take off your your your heart you know uh uh not our knowledge not our smartness he you know he want to bring us in contact with our reality amen you want to bring us in contact with our reality that's where we are taken from and that's where we will return one of these days praise the Lord amen may God just help us this morning amen so you see the uh uh uh that's that that's that's a Redemption language and uh uh uh and God is stepping down as as we are talking about the Redeemer uh in his Redemption you know well here is the people that God promised the Seed of Abraham that he promised Abraham that he will come down and deliver them remember Genesis 15 he make that Covenant to Abraham he says your sea was so John in a strange L but I will deliver them just at that time he setting the sin for Redemption he's setting the sin for Redemption even in the even in the the the the the the the Bible there if you were to redeem a land or you were to redeem uh your brother or you know you you you have to present yourself the nearest Kings have to be there you don't send somebody else to go and do Redemption for you no they want to know how are you related to this person so the want doing Redemption you have to be there praise the Lord amen you have to be there brother desimon amen yeah you have to go to Ghana you have to be there praise the Lord can you imagine a man going to get married he says where where is the husband no I came to represent him no I'm here to represent the husband I'm here to to take the wife and carry her praise the Lord now so you will see uh uh uh uh you will see that uh it's a very strong Redemption language very very strong Redemption language I know as I just T talk about this uh uh Isaac and Ela pop into my head and uh and and there is something also that connects with that that many times our eye runs over but since it comes to my mind we will look at it a little bit amen it's not part of my my my thought here you have to remember now Abraham sending out his seven amen Abraham sending out his seven and the Bible says that uh uh this El eel was born in the House of Abraham okay he was not Abraham's son but he was born in the house of Abraham you remember God and Abraham conversation Abraham was even presenting Ela to God that this is one that is born in my house you know he can he can be my hairs no God said no you will have a son praise the Lord now see where is the connection now God Abraham had to SW I mean Ela had to put his his hands under the ti of Abraham and he had to swear okay and then when he did that he was he was he was representing the father he was representing but there is another thing also that uh uh uh that I want for us to pay attention to and uh are we together let's let's go over to Genesis let's go over to Genesis if you want to see the picture clearly you we will have to begin from Genesis chapter 24 we have to begin from Genesis chapter 24 and where the picture comes in with Genesis 24 is there uh praise the Lord it looks like it looks like when I was praying I was praying for brother Jordan and his family and they riding church so it looks like uh for once I thought we were back in the book of Acts having a prayer meeting praying for Peter and he standing behind the door I'm trying to get away from it it keeps coming to my mind so I just have to say it now so if if you look in in the in that you will realize let me let me bring something to your mind here God is the author of this book praise the Lord he's the author of this book and he said it in in a divine order like Jesus said the scripture cannot be broken praise the Lord now remember when Abraham took El I mean took Isaac to the mountain when he took Isaac up to the mountain to be able to sacrifice Isaac on the order of God the Bible says that to Abraham Isaac was dead okay to Abraham Isaac was dead the Bible say he offer him as one that was dead now so when he went up to the mountain and God held Abraham him and show him a ram that became a resurrection when a when Isaac came from on the altar to sit up and stand up there was a resurrection praise the lord we don't have time to go through all of that but what I want to grab your mind to is that from from that time the Bible did not mention Isaac it did not talk about Isaac again until Rebecca praise the Lord amen because what took place there was a prophecy it was a prophecy life God prophesied he demonstrated life that after the death buried and Resurrection Christ will not appear again until he appear with his bride praise the Lord are we together amen so God has to make a provision here and if you even realize you will see that when you read the scripture the Bible did not call the name of elaser when he went to find Rebecca his name is not mentioned just go and and read it why because the Bible said Jesus said when the comforter shall come he will not speak of himself so El name is now mentioned why because it's all prophecy so God designed that he plac those things there are we together okay we together let's continue together Hallelujah glory be to God you love the Lord now so when elaser went to take Rebecca praise the Lord there is another part of this whole Redemption story that is that God place in a way that you have to pay attention and let's pick a few of that as we look at this amen when you read Genesis 24 the Bible talks about this man this seven of Abraham that went to take his bride because he was the one that was commissioned the emphasis is on the seven but the Bible also make us to know that Rebecca had to water him cell and it was not one it was more than one praise the Lord if you watch carefully here with me I pointed this out to you sometime ago and uh but since we uh we uh on the subject let's look at it again praise the Lord I pointed this out to you some some time ago all of those camel that Ela went with Ela never went alone there were men that went with El eer because the the Jewish marriage should be witnessed by 10 men it should be witnessed by 10 men they have a they have a Jewish word for that I can I can get it up on top of my head now but uh uh but if you look right here in the scripture I just I just wanted to bring uh just give me a few minutes here I kind of cut myself off God to bring this to you because what I was talking about uh the Redeemer redeeming uh this whole story of a thing pop up in my mind the scripture speaks about Abraham and his men because it has it has a perect type there is something I want to I want to make emphasis on if I can just get the verse and read it to you then I will I will uh I will take it up from there you know brother br will talk about Faithful Men that that that St with uh with the messenger he talks about Joshua he talks about he talks about uh uh uh Elijah standing with Elijah and uh uh okay let's just let's just go ahead I will if I grab it I'll get it I will get it to you let me not take all of my S of time on this now so the picture that I wanted to bring to you is that the Redeemer is always in his Redemption he's always in his Redemption you cannot take the Redeemer out of his Redemption it will not be a complete Redemption amen it won't be a complete Redemption uh if you take the Redeemer out of it out of his Redemption it will not be a complete Redemption uh the Redeemer has to be in his redemption or else the Redemption will not be complete so we see that over and over uh uh is play out throughout the scripture you go over to the Book of Ruth you will see the very same thing there and uh because you see God don't break he don't break the order of his word no he don't break the order of his word he always bring the word to pass the way it's supposed to be praise the Lord now so we see here thank you brother Dan now so we see that uh uh uh let me read something something here so I can I can be able to capture my thought again brother B says over in God has a provided way let's let's just read this together now the Lord of redemption in the Old Testament that it must be a Kingsman Redeemer the Lord required not any person could redeem a lost estate but it had to be somebody that was King fo praise the Lord it had to be somebody that was King folks somebody that was King folks and then somebody that was able to redeem worthy enough to redeem financially able he has to be financially able how beautiful oh my Christ worthy double worthy the king of Heaven seeing the little holy spirit filled Church dropping a little handful now and then notice the only way that God could redeem God had to come down and be be made King folks to us praise the Lord God has to come down and be made King folks to up us you cannot help any mortar if you are not willing to step in their shoes you can help them brother BR talks about there in Mexico he said I saw that blind man just like my father I I try to measure his shoulder to see if my coat will fit him I took up my shoes to see if if it will fit him he says all I was trying to do I was trying to put myself in his place it says and there God gave a vision and he got his sight just like I said our faithfulness is partial is limited is conditioned would rather help people from a distance but sometime the real work of redemption you have to step into that person's shoes to be able to understand what they are going through what they are dealing with sometimes we think we understand you are looking at it from your side you are looking at it from your side you are reasoning how you will deal with it but you are not them are we together you are not them what an awesome God we serve the king of glory god had to come down and be made King first to us God was in spirit God come down and was made flesh God was in Christ reconciling the word to himself then in order to redeem men he had to become man he has to step in our shoes he had to step in this shoes of us existing element to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities to know what it is to be rejected he Ste in our shoes right from birth he knew what it is to be in the womb for nine months even down to the Grave he know what it is to be in a dark grave he was touched by the feelings of our infi are we together you love the Lord Brother Brandon will says in the message St you of a perfect man when he talks about uh uh uh the position of our age in in in the stature in the stature of the seven Church ages when he talks about our age being the age of Brotherly kindness he says this is what brotherly kindness is he says when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in the place on the matter praise the Lord when job was going through his trial the devil told the Lord and says uh you you know you you have put a you put an edge around him you know and uh and the devil told him all of this after sickness uh I mean job all job children die in everything the Lord came back again and say have you considered my seven job I love that place in the Bible I wrote it down many years ago still looking for an inspiration to preach it you know why the devil told job he say skin on skin praise the Lord you can break you can talk about it until it touch you Jo he said job can live for his hand and say blessed be the the lord gave it the Lord take it away but he says this time skin on skin let it not be far from him let it touch him let it touch him they say when the robber meets the road praise the Lord when the robber miss the road that's where you know the reality of things we can sit back we can judge people we can tell people story more thans praise the lord we can tell their story molding thems I mean even even even some of our young people it's just so easy to sit back there and you know well you see them in church one time you don't see them you you you have a thought you have an idea about them and and uh I mean what what's what's what form of redemption is that that's the devil's Redemption because the devil's form which of course he don't redeem any way he's just an accuser he's an accuser of the bread he's always looking for some kind of a fault always looking for something to say about you praise the Lord when we get to that brother the kindness put yourself in a place on the matter now you said my brother sin against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said he said uh seven times today he says uh 70 time seven see brother brother the kindness now you see if a brother if a brother all out of tone don't be impatient with him praise the Lord putting yourself in the place on the matter praise the Lord that's the reason why the Bible says there is only one mediator between man the man Christ Jesus he had to step down in our shoes we had to take our place and what I'm trying to show you is that Our Redeemer is faithful in truth praise the Lord every promise he have made he will k keep his promises he said he will have a church without spot or Rinker he will keep his promises praise the Lord all we have to do is just is just acknowledge his presence when we acknowledge his presence that he's in our midst to do what he said he will do brother Bram say he's he does not come as an unlocker he's not a recording Angel he does not come around and say this one is sleeping in church oh I'm I'm going to take note on them and this other person is is just distracted they're thinking about shopping I'm going he does not come he comes to bring to manifest his word he comes to make his word real he's a God that want to step out of the pages of the Bible and become real to his people amen praise the Lord as long as we keep God behind the clouds that's what tradition we do it keeps God behind the cloud on the great throne but the prophet of God says some days you'll realize that heaven is not behind the cloud here it's just a dimension that is right here this morning amen it's just a dimension that is very so close to us you love the Lord what a wonderful Jesus the Lord is good amen he has not forsaken his people he have not left us in the hands of of of men to to misuse us and and and and and misjudge us no he promised that he will be with us amen that he will go with us he will never leave us he will never forsake us okay beautiful I knew it was right here we will get it Genesis chapter 24 Genesis chapter 24 if you if you if you read 24 carefully you'll realize that two times the Bible mentioned these men verse 53 and and the Seven BR for Jew and of silver and Jew of gold and Ren and gave them to Rebecca and gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink he and the men he and the men so El is are never went alone all those cell that Rebecca felt there were men that were carrying them and this last day Ela never never came alone God has raised up men praise the Lord God has has raised up men to witness the ministry of ela and to carry out the work of getting out the bride but you see because Ela was the one that was giv the commission that is the reason why the scripture emphasized on him but there were men that went with Ela to carry out the commission and that is the reason why God have to raise up a fful ministrate in this day to be able to carry out the commission that was given to our La ether praise the Lord I knew he was there I read it and the did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and the T all night and the rose up early in the morning and he said send me the way onto my master so you see if you if you play it in the prophecy El is that is taking the place of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord he's taking the place of the Holy Ghost that's the reason why his name is not mentioned in the text but we know that he is the seven because he's the one that go Abraham pointed out to God and said this is a faithful one in my house because there was a prophecy that was playing out a Divine prophecy of from Calvary to the Redemption of the Bride are we together now so you see that's a Redemption language the Redeemer have to step on the scene praise the Lord the Redeemer have to step on the scene we can counsel so you we can encourage you until God become real to you until he become real and he become personal to you all you have is just an understanding all you have is just an intellectual is just op here but for this world to live God has to be flesh for the word to come to pass in your life God have to be flesh the same way he tell Moses take of your shoes that's the same way he's telling us get rid of your proud get rid of your arrogance said get rid of your tradition and your Creed I want to step down into that body even if it is just one soul that I will win I want to use your body for that if you will just take off your shoes praise the Lord when he stepped down Moses says I can't talk he said who make mouth I make mouth or I want just give me your shoes let me step in it the work will be done I'm not I'm not relying on your ability all I want you is just surrounder I'm not looking at your strength I'm not looking at your intelligence just give me a vessel to use oh if the church would just give God a vessel to use if we were just give him our boat we will get a great catch amen if we would give God our boat we will get a great catch we put God so much in the distance that's why sometimes we do things to ourself and do things to others with no consciousness that is right before God praise the lord we have the H man picture on our wall the pillow of fire picture everywhere but yet we fuss and we do things that just shows the the the least of Consciousness he said you are not the one that told him to he said it I will not leave you I will not forsake you praise the Lord the church has put him behind the clouds the church has put him in the distance we got to fast and pray we need we need seven days of fast so God can come close we need to you we need to cry to God oh we need to that's what the church is doing we want to bring God oh God is so far we want to bring that's just how those prophets of B Elijah told them maybe God is on vacation if your God is so far like that that you have to cut yourself that's what the church has given to us put God in so much of a distance that we can stay right in the church we can fast we can we can uh argue with one another right in the church when we are praising God why because we keep him behind the clouds Moses said the Lord is NY he's so close he's so close praise the Lord he's so close there's a scripture that I love in Deuteronomy chapter 5 let me find a place to close here now that I found that verse I was looking for I can close amen you know what kind of feeling I will have praise the Lord I would just say oh po you I don't know how those people got you up there preaching I don't know how they got you up there preaching bu must be grateful that you get people to sit down and listen to you Deuteronomy chapter 5 you go home read the whole chapter I love this chapter because it speaks of God coming down in the midst of the people and he looking at his people and he's seeing how far they are away from him even though he's so close he's so close but how far they are away from him and let's read this oh praise the Lord oh my let's start verse verse 28 put this glasses on your face my friend and the Lord heard the voice of your words Moses saying speaking to them the Lord heard the voice of your word when ye speak unto me and the Lord said unto me I have heard the voice of the words of the people if we would just listen thing he will say I've heard I've heard your complaint in your heart I've heard your doubt I've heard your fear I've heard your fces let's read a little bit down praise the Lord glory be to God I've heard the voice of the words of this people people which they have spoken unto the they have well said all that they have spoken listen to this now this is what I love oh that there were such an heart in them that they will fear me and keep all my commandment always that it might be well with them and with their children forever so close to his people hearing their complaints hearing everything that he's saying he says oh if there were such a heart in them if their heart were conditioned if their heart were conditioned if your heart is not conditioned no matter how loud God will speak he will throw things all over the place to get your your your attention you won't see it because your heart is not conditioned God once again expressing expressing you know when you read the word you study the word you come to understand that the Old Testament God was just expressing his thoughts he was not giving the people Commandments he was expressing his thoughts he was expressing his desire and in the New Testament he came down to fulfill the things he expressed he cannot give us commandment because we can't do it he was just expressing his thoughts and his desires to the people oh if there was such a heart in them if their hearts were conditioned if if our heart is conditioned we will see God from the rising of the morning to the going down of the son like that old man on the on the on the on the on the seene The Little B said is there God he says son it's all I have seen all my years fishing that's what I have seen with tears coming down his eyes prophet of God say if you have God in you you will see God in everything you will see God in everything if our hearts are condition not not our smartness it can't even help us sometime it put us into trouble it's a conditioned heart a heart that is ready to run to the father a heart heart that is ready to ask for help a heart that is ready to say God I need you a conditioned heart you can have a Redemption without a redeemer no the Redeemer has to be on the sin he have to do the work he has to do the work we're not going any word if we keep God out of the picture if you keep God out of your picture you are not going anywhere you have to get God into your daily reality your daily reality is the things you deal with every day he not he's not a God that just only look for you to pick up a bible to read before you say okay yeah okay now I think I can jump on the scene now she reading the Bible no no no no no no no no no no no he's a God I want you to acknowledge when you are in the kitchen he want you to acknowledge when you are watching brushing your teeth if you bring God into your reality if you bring God into your reality because that's what he said praise the Lord many times he's he's just standing by can they just acknowledge me he's anxious to move on the scene but you have the whole place controll with attitude you just controlling the whole place because you want to show yourself here and and you just you just overshadowed and he just he's just trying to find a way to get your attention give this matter to me let me change it for you we can't have healing without the Healer praise the Lord that's what brother Brown was says if if if beness can heal a wound he said it must heal this coat when I tear it say when I tear it and pull it there you should be able to heal it but God has to come down and mend the tissues together he want to be part of our reality you want to be part take off your shoes for I have come down to deliver my people he told Joshua Joshua picked that up immediately when he moved on the scene he pick it up immediately he say are you for us or are you against us he say I'm the captain of the Lord hor Joshua took off his shoes says I can't F this B to step in it he take off his shoes and say I can fight this I can fight this battle step in it you are the captain step in it you see how when you just you just seize the opportunity man God will jump in it because he's ever ready ever ready to move on the scene he's a faithful Redeemer he governs in the Affairs of men he governed in our Affairs oh if they will have such a heart to acknowledge me may God give us heart to acknowledge God praise the Lord may he give us heart to acknowledge him that he's not far he's not far he's right here he goes with you in your vehicle he goes with you to your home you don't leave God in church if he would give us that heart to acknowledge him that he said he will never leave us and he will never forsake us you want to see the supernatural ask God to condition your heart to acknowledge Him you want to see the supernatural you want to see God moving on the scene ask him to condition your heart praise the lord we have so much plans so much thing we want to do with our life that is so hard to borrow him our shoes to wear praise the Lord amen have you seen somebody like that they have RS of shoe stack you can only wear one at a time but they are not ready to let anybody wear another one they are not ready because all of those shoes have their occasion you can only wear one shoe at a time allow him to step in the other ones while you only wearing one allow him to step in the other one say Lord just take over this thing take over this thing of my life use this one and use that one I gave everything to you and I promise you you never give God anything and he returned back ugly you know if you give it to him he take good care of it he give it back to you better than you give it to him praise the Lord he will give it to you better than you give it to him take off your shoes is a Redemption language that same God that spoke to Moses out of the burning bush is speaking to us every day he comes down and he said take off your shoes he point out things in our lives trying to get our attention saying oh if they will have such a heart to acknowledge me praise the Lord and musicians can come the musicians can come it's a beautiful thing I wish I had a time to just take you through Genesis 22- 24 is it's a very beautiful the prophecy is laid out in such a way you have a time just go and read it you realize that Isaac never appeared again in the scripture until Rebecca was found God laid it out so beautifully why because it was a prophecy speaks about God taking his own son up to Calvary giving him as a ransom for us resurrecting and taking him over to the throne until there's a bride that is ready for him then the Bible say Isaac was in the field that's the next time he appear in the scripture in the field waiting for his bride elar was coming with her remember not only elar they are faithful men that is taking this message to make sure that the bride get out of here why because it was a dangerous joining there were dangerous joining there were men the the the Philistines and all those people that were there so God had to send men with elaser and they are men that step out for the for the bride not just for big church and big names men that are laboring therefore for The Souls of the people grab the revelation of the word let's lift up Jesus let's get ourself out of the [Music] picture God will always have a man there will always be a man to cry out against sin there will always be a man to bring a people to recognize the [Music] word even know some would want to use it for one thing or another but God will have men that will remain faithful to

only Medical kid that they had was I am the Lord that Health all your diseases 40 years in the wilderness children were born children got hurt but the Lord healed [Music] him and you and myself we experience the same thing God in his Mercy blessed the little things that we have we can go Ms and mons his grace help us keep us in good health and sometimes we we look away from those things we are looking for I mean something out there and some some kind of a big thing to re to to quantify that as God's blessing the grace that he gave you every day for the fear of God to be on your heart to know that you are there is a God to to realize that I'm a Child of God that is a rich blessing God releas his Blessing in faith and the knowledge of his word a desire in your heart to get closer to God what on Earth can we compare to [Music] that just to sit by yourself and say Lord I Need more of you you can say it but you your your heart is crying out to God to allow God to squeeze your heart and allow the juice to come out of your [Music] eyes many of us we don't want to give our heart to God because we don't want to see we don't want people to see us crying so we just want him to touch touch us a little bit don't don't don't don't squeeze my heart I don't I don't want to be so emotional and and and so cry I mean I mean sometimes you get to that place you just don't know what to alter all you can do just cry because that is the way that is designed by God for a baby to express themsel is to cry out [Music] Lord saints of God what has been given to us is the opening of the word the prophet is not coming back to open the word we don't believe in a return Ministry the word is already open the Holy Ghost is here to make this word real to to you that's the work of the Holy Ghost to make this word real to make Jesus Christ a person to you get you out of religion and get us to the reality of Jesus Christ you mean that God will be so wicked and allow you to to starve yourself for seven days starve yourself for 21 days just because you want something from him that's how religion has abused our mind that we have to do that to please God I believe in fasting and
