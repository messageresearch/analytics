[22:15] prayer needs tonight.
[22:17] And uh the end and his family had with
[22:21] us tonight was not feeling very well.
[22:25] And so we want to remember them in
[22:29] prayer
[22:31] and
[22:34] and sister now text also that she will
[22:38] not be with us tonight. I think she's uh
[22:41] uh stay settling down uh at her place
[22:45] and uh and also after the funeral of her
[22:50] brother yesterday and I think they have
[22:52] a bearing today. So I think there's a
[22:55] lot of uh family things they have to do.
[22:57] We will pray for brother Michael also
[23:00] that the Lord will will be able to touch
[23:03] him and u and just uh uh strengthen him,
[23:07] renew his health. And so we just want to
[23:10] thank the Lord for all of that tonight.
[23:13] I see a prayer request, prayers report
[23:15] from brother Elijah and uh I think uh
[23:19] he's traveling back on Friday back to
[23:22] his post of duty. So we want to just uh
[23:24] remember our brother in prayer that the
[23:27] Lord will be with him as he goes back uh
[23:31] to his uh uh workstation that the Lord
[23:35] will just watch over him, keep him and
[23:38] bring to pass all the desire of his
[23:40] heart and uh there are uh some special
[23:46] need I want for us to take tonight
[23:49] uh as we will go to the Lord in prayer.
[23:51] here. One of them is is this uh request.
[23:55] This is from brother Andrew Boscout. We
[23:58] have uh prayed uh of this need tonight.
[24:02] I mean we have prayed about uh his uh
[24:04] his grandson uh Javas and he wrote uh a
[24:09] text message and said my grandson Javvis
[24:11] is going through depression. The devil
[24:14] is uh bombarding his mind that he want
[24:18] to kill himself.
[24:22] something to do with uh with seeing
[24:25] someone killed himself years back.
[24:28] Requesting prayer for this young man. He
[24:32] just had a baby.
[24:34] Uh my great grandson
[24:38] hate to see him going through this. He
[24:41] mentioned his mom who he lost when uh he
[24:46] was uh 7 years old. Praise the Lord. So
[24:51] we want we want to just remember this
[24:53] young man tonight and I know that is uh
[24:56] very uh dear to brother brother u uh
[25:02] Ocal brother Andrew. So we just want to
[25:05] pray for him tonight. And uh another
[25:08] need I would want us to remember also
[25:12] um it might draw me is is drawing me
[25:15] close to speak on what I want to talk
[25:17] about tonight. And uh couple of years
[25:21] ago, we all uh will remember many of a
[25:25] few of us that was around and uh we
[25:28] trusted the Lord for sister um
[25:32] uh sister Kish uh on her uh transplant
[25:37] that she did and the Lord has been good
[25:40] to her keeping her. Um now we know
[25:43] there's there's a lot of changes in uh
[25:46] uh the health insurance thing and I
[25:49] think that is uh is uh uh uh affecting
[25:55] her getting the medication that she
[25:57] would need to continue to to remain
[26:01] healthy and that is not only way sister
[26:04] kish we know it's a nationwide thing so
[26:07] there are many many uh believers that
[26:10] are on uh uh serial health concern
[26:14] issues that are really needing God to
[26:18] move on the scene. And you know, as I
[26:20] was just thinking thinking about that,
[26:24] uh even uh my mother-in-law, Sister Liz,
[26:28] uh with all the changes now, uh uh
[26:31] different protocols they have to go
[26:33] through to reapply for insurance and all
[26:36] of that. So, we just want to bring that
[26:39] uh to the Lord tonight for many people
[26:43] that uh that really need God's
[26:46] intervention. Amen. Until they can get
[26:49] uh back on an adequate uh medical
[26:52] insurance that will be able to pay for
[26:55] their medication or get them through
[26:57] their treatment, they will need the Lord
[27:00] to be able to help them. Praise the
[27:02] Lord. So uh uh I talk about that a whole
[27:06] lot of that today. I had that on my
[27:08] heart and I was just praying. I was just
[27:11] thinking about many people you know
[27:13] people that uh uh have to go through
[27:16] cancer treatment and uh uh dialysis and
[27:20] and different things and and many of
[27:23] these people some of them are believers.
[27:26] So we just want to bring that need
[27:28] before the Lord and uh uh and with what
[27:32] uh uh also been happening around our
[27:35] city today with the loss of uh the life
[27:39] of a young woman, we want to remember
[27:41] that family also and just pray that the
[27:44] Lord will send comfort their way and uh
[27:48] and he would just keep every one of us
[27:50] safe in such uh such a troubling time
[27:54] that we are in. So, let's just bow our
[27:56] hearts. Let's take our hearts to the
[27:58] Lord in prayer tonight. And u
[28:18] let's pray together. Heavenly Father, in
[28:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, oh

[44:10] there's a family
[44:12] um
[44:13] that uh having some domestic need and uh
[44:18] they reach out to us and ask that we
[44:21] pray for them. So we want to bring a
[44:24] unspoken prayer request for them tonight
[44:27] and uh that Lord will just uh intervene
[44:31] in their in their situation
[44:34] uh got themselves to the place Lord
[44:37] where they really need God to intervene
[44:40] and help them. So, I just want to take
[44:43] up a special unspoken request for them
[44:46] tonight and uh they uh they out of
[44:49] state. They just uh call for our help.
[44:53] So, we want to pray that the Lord will

[44:59] trust in the Lord to be able to get
[45:00] there and see how we can be able to help
[45:03] them. But you think about it, how many
[45:06] homes that are affected this way. We
[45:09] just want to pray and ask that the Lord
[45:11] will just be able to uh help the
[45:14] different families that are going
[45:16] through things like this and uh the Lord
[45:19] will also lay his hands upon the

[45:25] sister, the Lord will help the brother
[45:27] and the God will just be merciful and he
[45:30] will just help his people. The devil is
[45:32] coming in
[45:34] many different ways to be able to rob us
[45:37] of our our joy. But we want to hold to
[45:41] the name of the Lord because uh the name
[45:44] of the Lord is a mighty tower that the
[45:46] righteous run into and they are saved.
[45:49] While we take up this knee tonight, I

[46:39] brothers and sisters, the different
[46:40] families. the Lord will help our young
[46:43] people and uh he will just uh bless us
[46:46] in a special way. Let's let's just
[46:49] express our gratitude to the Lord as we
[46:51] remember this family and many other
[46:54] families that we need God in in a
[46:57] special way to intervene in their lives
[47:00] in their home in the needs in their
[47:02] home. And some are praying for their
[47:05] children. some uh uh I pray for their

[1:04:02] chapter 103
[1:04:04] just a little exitation tonight and uh I
[1:04:07] was studing on to continue on my subject

[1:04:36] You hear bunch of prayer requests coming
[1:04:38] through from different saints and all
[1:04:41] praying that God will that God will help
[1:04:44] them. And I believe that uh that I mean
[1:04:49] when when we have crisis like this,
[1:04:52] that's when as believers, we have to
[1:04:54] start looking for the supernatural.
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Because it's uh it's it's the Lord that
[1:04:59] health our diseases. Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And uh uh medication will sustain us and
[1:05:06] all of that. We we will not trash it
[1:05:08] down because it's been a blessing.
[1:05:10] Brother Brandon says medical science has
[1:05:12] been a blessing. But when things are
[1:05:14] just at a place where I mean uh we have
[1:05:18] done all that we know how to do then
[1:05:20] let's look to the Lord. Amen. And and
[1:05:23] start to see the hand of God moving. So
[1:05:25] I just want to speak in that direction
[1:05:27] tonight a little bit just to be able to
[1:05:30] encourage you. We read Psalm chapter
[1:05:32] 103. I'll read verse one. You read verse
[1:05:34] two like we normally do. Let's just do
[1:05:37] that for meditation tonight. Bless the
[1:05:39] Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within
[1:05:43] me, bless his holy name.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Who h who forgiveth all thine
[1:05:53] iniquities, who health all thy diseases.
[1:06:00] from destruction. Who granteth thee with
[1:06:03] loving kindness and t of mercy, who
[1:06:06] satisfy thy mouth with good things, so
[1:06:09] that thy youth is renewed like the
[1:06:13] eagle.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; He made known his ways unto Moses, his
[1:06:24] acts unto the children of Israel. The
[1:06:28] Lord is merciful and gracious.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; He will not always try, neither will he
[1:06:37] keep his anger forever.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; For as the heaven is is high above the
[1:06:50] earth, so great is his mercy towards
[1:06:53] them that fear him.
[1:07:02] Like as a father pity of his children,
[1:07:06] so the Lord pityth them that fear him.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; As for men, his days are as grass, as a
[1:07:20] flower in the field, so he he
[1:07:24] flourisheth.
[1:07:34] But the mercy of the Lord is from
[1:07:37] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[1:07:39] that fear him and his righteousness on
[1:07:43] unto children's children.
[1:07:52] The Lord has prepared his throne in
[1:07:55] heaven, and his kingdom ruleth over all.
[1:08:10] Bless ye the Lord, all ye his host, ye
[1:08:14] ministers of his that do his pleasure.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, all his works in all
[1:08:22] places of his dominion. Bless the Lord,
[1:08:25] oh my soul. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you tonight. You may have
[1:08:30] a seat.
[1:08:34] So that's what we want to do tonight. We
[1:08:35] just want to bless the Lord and uh we
[1:08:39] just want to bless the Lord tonight and
[1:08:42] and forgetting that all his benefits.
[1:08:45] Amen. The Lord has been good to us and
[1:08:48] uh uh he has been he has been very very
[1:08:52] for many years many years I've I've
[1:08:55] taught on on a verse in this it caught
[1:08:58] my mind many years back verse seven he
[1:09:01] make known his ways unto Moses his acts
[1:09:05] unto the children of Israel that's what
[1:09:07] I want us to look into a little bit and
[1:09:10] and mainly the reason why I want us to
[1:09:13] look into this is All because I want us
[1:09:16] to look at it around healing.
[1:09:20] I want us to look at it around healing
[1:09:22] because there is a very very big uh uh
[1:09:27] misunderstanding and it has been there
[1:09:30] for a very long time. It has been there
[1:09:33] for a very very long time. And uh uh and
[1:09:37] that's what I want to look at. I want
[1:09:39] for us to look at tonight. David said,
[1:09:41] "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all
[1:09:44] that is within me, bless his holy name.
[1:09:48] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[1:09:51] not all his benefits.
[1:09:54] Who forgaveth all thine iniquities, who
[1:09:57] healeth all thy diseases," Brother
[1:10:00] Brandham says if we will notice and and
[1:10:03] he just only appointing us for us to pay
[1:10:06] attention. But if you look right there
[1:10:08] in the scripture, you will see that the
[1:10:10] Bible say he forgaveth all thine
[1:10:14] iniquities
[1:10:16] and he health all thy diseases. So it's
[1:10:20] an all. Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; So there is not a disease that God
[1:10:24] cannot heal. Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; There is not an iniquity that he cannot
[1:10:29] forgive.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm glad that uh uh
[1:10:34] that he forgave uh uh our iniquities.
[1:10:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; And uh uh
[1:10:47] I heard a saying about waiver force. Uh
[1:10:52] some of us that would know waiver force.
[1:10:54] Uh he said one time I'm glad that God
[1:10:59] uh he said I'm glad that God choose me
[1:11:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:03] because if he have seen me now he would
[1:11:05] have changed his mind. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he he choose me and and he
[1:11:12] loved me and redeem me even before I got
[1:11:16] here. Praise the Lord. before all all
[1:11:19] our foolishness. The Lord we know that
[1:11:22] he never changed his mind uh uh
[1:11:25] concerning his word and concerning his
[1:11:27] people and uh but uh uh so we just we
[1:11:31] just want to look at some few things
[1:11:33] tonight. So the Bible says uh he
[1:11:35] forgiveth all our iniquities
[1:11:39] oh health all thy diseases. Now, if you
[1:11:42] look at this, I I I believe honor
[1:11:46] inspiration
[1:11:48] uh uh David
[1:11:50] is is uh is is prophesying and he's
[1:11:54] saying something to us for us to be able
[1:11:55] to pay attention because uh most of the
[1:11:59] time sicknesses we know that uh uh uh is
[1:12:05] related to sin. Amen. Sin was the
[1:12:09] doorway that brought sicknesses. So many
[1:12:12] times when people uh uh are dealing with
[1:12:15] some illness or so uh it's it's so easy
[1:12:18] for us to start looking in our lives and
[1:12:21] and start asking what wrong have we
[1:12:23] done. If you remember there those people
[1:12:25] came to Jesus and said what what sin has
[1:12:28] this man committed. He say his sin or
[1:12:30] his parents sin or grandparents sin or
[1:12:32] great-grandparent sin. Jesus said none
[1:12:34] of that. None of the above. Amen. He
[1:12:37] said none of the above. Uh the only
[1:12:40] reason is for God to glorify himself.
[1:12:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what I want us to look
[1:12:47] at tonight. uh I really thought that uh
[1:12:51] I will I will I will be able to bring
[1:12:53] this to you and have enough time because
[1:12:56] when uh I spoke on the message
[1:13:00] uh the son of righteousness
[1:13:05] that rises with healing in his wings
[1:13:08] and uh uh I know sometimes you know we
[1:13:13] we preach things and uh and sometimes uh
[1:13:17] you don't react You don't get it right
[1:13:19] there. You know, it takes a while. We
[1:13:21] have to go around again and change the
[1:13:23] subject. But just like we spoke about
[1:13:28] the four anointings,
[1:13:30] the lion, the ox, the man, and the
[1:13:34] eagle.
[1:13:36] What
[1:13:38] I'm I'm really trying to bring to you
[1:13:40] for us to be able to understand is that
[1:13:43] brother Brandham taught us that that is
[1:13:46] the anointing that guard God's people
[1:13:49] through all through all the ages.
[1:13:52] So it is the anointing that is guiding
[1:13:54] the people of God in general and also
[1:13:59] individually
[1:14:01] we we have those anointing. Praise the
[1:14:05] Lord. Amen. So when I say we have those
[1:14:09] anointing, what I'm trying to say is
[1:14:11] that if they are around us, they affect
[1:14:15] us
[1:14:16] from time to time.
[1:14:20] When the lion's anointing
[1:14:22] affect us, erases our faith. It makes us
[1:14:26] bored. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; And then sometimes we come under the ox
[1:14:31] anointing. We go through trials. We get
[1:14:34] sick and uh uh you know we go through
[1:14:37] different things. It can be financial
[1:14:39] whatever it is and then then and then
[1:14:42] sometimes we get under the man's
[1:14:44] anointing. God will give us wisdom. He
[1:14:46] will give us understanding. We will
[1:14:48] understand why certain things happening
[1:14:51] to us and we get under the ego's
[1:14:53] anointing is divine healing. It just
[1:14:56] happen like that. You know God provide
[1:14:59] your needs. You can testify about it. is
[1:15:02] something that God will do that you
[1:15:04] cannot really associate your effort to.
[1:15:07] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we go through
[1:15:10] those cycles. We we we go through those
[1:15:13] experiences in our lives.
[1:15:17] We go through those experiences in our
[1:15:19] lives. And uh uh uh by not understanding
[1:15:26] what God is doing in our life has made
[1:15:29] many people all through the ages
[1:15:33] that whenever
[1:15:36] they are not on the mountain top
[1:15:39] they always think that they have been
[1:15:42] forsaken by God
[1:15:45] because we always we we we
[1:15:49] lack I've said to you before, there is
[1:15:52] one thing that we must know about time.
[1:15:55] Time is not constant.
[1:15:57] As long as we stay in time in this time
[1:16:01] element, we will always have changes.
[1:16:04] Now we're dealing with winter. Couple of
[1:16:06] months from now, the spring will come,
[1:16:08] the grasses will be up again, and then
[1:16:10] summer and so we will always have
[1:16:13] changes. And that is the same thing with
[1:16:15] our life. He's the God of the winter.
[1:16:18] He's the God of the spring. He's the God
[1:16:20] of summer and uh and of the fall. And
[1:16:24] that is the same way in the life of the
[1:16:26] believer. Are we together?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; But you see, in all ages, the people of
[1:16:34] God, the people of God
[1:16:39] have really never understood how God
[1:16:42] been dealing with him.
[1:16:46] That is one of the biggest problem we
[1:16:48] have
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; is not understanding how God is dealing
[1:16:52] with us. What is he doing in our life?
[1:16:56] Sometimes we don't understand it
[1:16:57] immediately.
[1:16:59] But we need to come to that place where
[1:17:03] we know that God is in control. Whatever
[1:17:06] that is happening in my life, around my
[1:17:09] life this time, I might not understand
[1:17:11] it. But one thing for certain, I know
[1:17:13] that it is not the devil that is driving
[1:17:16] this car of mine.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; It's not the devil.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have had an accident and and you
[1:17:24] know uh uh uh uh uh you know, a wreck my
[1:17:27] vehicle, you know, my house almost
[1:17:29] burned the other time and and uh you
[1:17:32] know, the my my mother-in-law uh uh fell
[1:17:34] sick. It's it's almost getting to a year
[1:17:36] now. been praying in order for for one
[1:17:39] thing that is setting in my heart. I
[1:17:41] know that it is not the devil that is
[1:17:43] driving my vehicle.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not the one running my home.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; He's neither the one running my life.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the thing the thing that
[1:17:55] is show there is that whenever I I put
[1:17:58] my heart before the Lord, I I don't feel
[1:18:00] any condemnation.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And and and that is
[1:18:06] what has happened all through the ages.
[1:18:09] The people of God have only that's why
[1:18:12] Job said to his wife, I mean, should we
[1:18:15] only praise God for good things?
[1:18:19] Is is he only God when things are well
[1:18:21] with us?
[1:18:25] Is he still not God that heal the sick?
[1:18:28] He still not God that can provide for
[1:18:30] us. How will he provide if there is not
[1:18:33] a need that has come in our lives?
[1:18:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; So all through the ages,
[1:18:41] God's people, you know, like like David
[1:18:44] said in the psalm also, God has been
[1:18:46] misunderstood.
[1:18:49] And we have misunderstood God.
[1:18:52] We have misunderstood
[1:18:55] the message that God has sent us. We
[1:18:57] have misunderstood the prophet
[1:19:00] because for many they they take this
[1:19:02] message to be like a society.
[1:19:06] We must all dress in a uniform like our
[1:19:09] brother. Yeah. We know we must look the
[1:19:11] same, cut our hair the same, march the
[1:19:13] same. That's what they take the message
[1:19:15] of the hour to be. No, that's not what
[1:19:17] it is.
[1:19:19] Are we together? So, so just for the few
[1:19:22] minutes that is before me tonight, I'm
[1:19:24] watching the timing and try to make sure
[1:19:26] that I get you out by 9:00 tonight so
[1:19:29] you can be able to go home. Thank the
[1:19:31] Lord for giving us just a little time of
[1:19:34] prayer meeting tonight. Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, uh um I want us to
[1:19:39] look at this. Like I said, I I've
[1:19:41] thought over this. I mean, just from a
[1:19:44] young believer when I started reading my
[1:19:47] Bible
[1:19:49] and uh and uh and and and a young
[1:19:52] preacher, I've taught over this, how he
[1:19:55] make known his ways unto Moses,
[1:19:59] he was the prophet, and his acts
[1:20:03] unto the children of Israel.
[1:20:07] And I think that is the same thing that
[1:20:09] has happened in in every generation.
[1:20:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; We We see his acts.
[1:20:16] The supernatural are the acts of God.
[1:20:20] Praise the Lord. Amen. When God provide
[1:20:24] is an act. He's a provider.
[1:20:27] But his ways,
[1:20:30] his ways, his thoughts and his purpose
[1:20:35] are hidden in his ways.
[1:20:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:42] His secret are all hidden in his ways.
[1:20:47] His arts are visible. Just like uh uh
[1:20:52] Paul will say in Romans chapter one, the
[1:20:55] the the things that God has created
[1:20:59] has already made God known. The visible
[1:21:02] things, the sun, the moon, and the star,
[1:21:04] all of those things are his eyes. They
[1:21:06] they are the the the evidence of his
[1:21:09] work of creation.
[1:21:12] His acts are made known. And and the
[1:21:15] thing one of the thing that is that is
[1:21:17] that that that that really caught my
[1:21:19] mind on this thing recently, it is how
[1:21:22] many many many around uh uh uh uh the
[1:21:27] message of the hour uh you know uh
[1:21:32] we trying to kind of a major on the
[1:21:35] first and second pool of brother
[1:21:37] Brandon. It's almost looks like every
[1:21:39] service have to be a healing service.
[1:21:41] Every time an evangelist comes around,
[1:21:44] we must we must we must uh create a
[1:21:46] prayer line, you know, uh and and again
[1:21:48] what is happening is that the people
[1:21:50] constantly come in a prayer line, they
[1:21:52] come for the same request, they come for
[1:21:53] the same request. Brother Brandham says
[1:21:55] that thing destroy faith.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; When John Ryan came in the prayer line
[1:22:01] and brother Brandham says, "You believe
[1:22:03] me to be a prophet?" He says, "Yes." He
[1:22:05] says, "Go. Your h the Lord has healed
[1:22:07] you." The next day he comes back in the
[1:22:09] prayer line. He says, uh, uh, Brother
[1:22:11] Brandon says, "I thought you said you
[1:22:12] believed me." He said, "But you said,
[1:22:14] uh, the Lord has healed me. My eyes
[1:22:16] didn't open."
[1:22:20] The thing that was good for John Ryan is
[1:22:23] that on this sermon, Brother Brandon was
[1:22:25] able to grab that John Ryan was a
[1:22:27] Catholic. And he says, "Catholic, they
[1:22:29] like confession." So I told him just go
[1:22:31] be confessing.
[1:22:34] Praise the Lord. But he says whenever
[1:22:36] the people goes pray for and they come
[1:22:39] back in the prayer line again it means
[1:22:41] that they really did not have faith.
[1:22:46] He said because even if we have faith we
[1:22:49] will not even need to come in the prayer
[1:22:51] line. Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; We will believe God for our healing
[1:22:55] right in our seat.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We will not need a man
[1:23:02] to lay his hands on us because we know
[1:23:04] that it is not the man hand that is
[1:23:06] healing. It is it is it is God that is
[1:23:08] healing us. Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord that health us.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Now I'm not I'm not uh ruling our prayer
[1:23:17] line. I'm not ruling out uh uh uh uh but
[1:23:22] if if you have watched me over the
[1:23:24] years, I'm not driven that way. I'm not
[1:23:27] driven. And and the reason why is that
[1:23:30] uh uh I my I always pray that God will
[1:23:33] help me to be able to have the people
[1:23:36] have confidence in the word.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I know that if if YOUR
[1:23:44] FAITH CAN RISE TO THE place and believe
[1:23:47] that God can be able to do it, he can do
[1:23:50] it to you right in your seat.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] And uh so that's that's where I want to
[1:24:04] go to tonight a little bit. Uh uh uh he
[1:24:07] make known his ways
[1:24:10] unto Moses.
[1:24:14] You remember he took Moses up on the
[1:24:16] mountain and gave Moses a vision for
[1:24:19] Moses to be able to build a tabernacle
[1:24:22] just like how it was how the faction
[1:24:24] looks in heaven.
[1:24:26] He gave Moses a vision for Moses to be
[1:24:29] able to give us the record of what took
[1:24:31] place in uh in in in in the Garden of
[1:24:34] Eden. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. All of those things Moses give it
[1:24:39] to us uh because God show him those
[1:24:43] things. And also in the midst of that,
[1:24:47] God revealed his ways onto Moses.
[1:24:52] But the people were seeing his acts.
[1:24:54] Amen.
[1:24:56] They saw how the water of Mara became
[1:24:59] sweet. They saw how mana fell from
[1:25:01] heaven. They saw the uh uh uh the light
[1:25:06] that was shining in Gushim while
[1:25:08] darkness was over in Egypt.
[1:25:10] They saw the acts of God.
[1:25:15] But the ways of God, the thoughts behind
[1:25:18] those acts is revealed to a prophet.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:24] Amen. The purpose behind the acts of God
[1:25:29] is revealed to a prophet.
[1:25:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why, you know, in
[1:25:37] every age, God will bring a man on the
[1:25:40] scene. He will use a man h just like he
[1:25:43] used the messenger throughout the ages.
[1:25:46] and and and the way that God will give
[1:25:49] them their ministry and the things that
[1:25:51] God will do in their life, there will be
[1:25:53] a h a a revelation of God's purpose.
[1:25:59] The people will see a healing ministry.
[1:26:02] The people will see the manifestation of
[1:26:05] the gifts of the spirit. But many of
[1:26:08] them will not understand
[1:26:10] the why.
[1:26:13] why God made this and why he never did
[1:26:16] this.
[1:26:19] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:26:25] Brother Brandon will says, "I was I was
[1:26:27] just looking looking for that quote uh
[1:26:29] uh just before the service tonight, but
[1:26:31] I can find it and give it to you." He
[1:26:33] was says that it was not every everybody
[1:26:37] that came through the prayer line that
[1:26:39] got healed.
[1:26:43] It was not everybody. Brother Brandham
[1:26:46] said on tape, he says people will come
[1:26:48] through the prayer line and and he will
[1:26:51] know that this person that don't have
[1:26:53] faith. He will know that this person is
[1:26:55] not healed. He will says God bless you.
[1:26:59] He says I never pronounce healing on
[1:27:02] anybody
[1:27:03] until I know they will be healed.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; He says I would just tell them God bless
[1:27:10] you. go in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:27:13] God bless you
[1:27:15] because he says some of those people are
[1:27:17] going to die of their illness.
[1:27:20] But you see what the church is doing
[1:27:23] today. I mean in some way we are caught
[1:27:26] up in all these kind of carastic thing
[1:27:29] that is happening. We want to make sure
[1:27:31] that uh h I mean if if there is a
[1:27:34] sickness we're going to pray it and pray
[1:27:36] it and and and ask God to heal. I I
[1:27:38] believe that I believe that God can
[1:27:40] heal.
[1:27:42] But I also believe that God is not
[1:27:46] waiting for us to pray until we break
[1:27:48] this thing before he heal.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] God heal by his will.
[1:28:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He heal based on his purpose.
[1:28:10] Are we are we together?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; I mean are you are you understanding my
[1:28:14] thoughts? And it's not only healing is
[1:28:17] is uh is is is different things
[1:28:20] different provisions and even
[1:28:22] deliverance and and and and you know and
[1:28:24] things uh that we are trusting the Lord
[1:28:27] for. We must be able to understand that
[1:28:30] God has a purpose and the purpose of God
[1:28:32] can never be defeated.
[1:28:36] Praise the Lord. For many of us and and
[1:28:39] and humans because uh we are so tied to
[1:28:43] these five senses until we see an act of
[1:28:47] God. Our faith is still limited. We
[1:28:51] believe in God but we still limit him.
[1:28:54] Until we can see a visible act. But we
[1:28:58] have to realize that faith is a
[1:29:01] substance of things hoped for. Yeah.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Our your faith sees it before it become
[1:29:07] visible.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Are you are you are you are you grabbing
[1:29:13] my thoughts
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; tonight? So I I would just share a few
[1:29:17] things with you. Like I said, I will try
[1:29:19] to leave you uh and and let you go
[1:29:21] tonight and and maybe another time we'll
[1:29:23] pick up from there. But uh I just I just
[1:29:26] thought on there that I will be able to
[1:29:29] share that with you. You see what
[1:29:30] brother Brandon will says here in a
[1:29:32] message
[1:29:34] looking to the unseen.
[1:29:37] He was says he says now we are thinking
[1:29:40] of a day that has gone where God moved
[1:29:44] in a manner to reveal himself to men to
[1:29:48] make his ways known unto men through his
[1:29:53] servants.
[1:29:54] the prophet,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; he make his ways known
[1:30:02] unto men,
[1:30:04] his ways known, why he would do certain
[1:30:07] thing and why he would not do certain
[1:30:10] thing.
[1:30:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] And that's the reason why brother Brand
[1:30:21] will say that uh you know if I go and
[1:30:24] pray for 10,000 people and they all I
[1:30:26] will still be praying because he's not
[1:30:28] the healer.
[1:30:30] He's taking God at his word. You are the
[1:30:33] Lord that health all our diseases.
[1:30:38] But if I place this need before the Lord
[1:30:41] and and the Lord does not heal it, I'm
[1:30:43] not going. remember the uh uh in a
[1:30:46] message warning and judgment a young
[1:30:48] girl that backslided and then after she
[1:30:51] came back to the Lord and she got sick
[1:30:53] and brother Brandon prayed and then
[1:30:54] after she died brother Brandham went to
[1:30:56] God and God said shut your mouth
[1:31:00] he says a cloud just came down as if God
[1:31:02] says shut up who are you for you to ask
[1:31:04] me question
[1:31:06] do you remember a couple of months ago
[1:31:08] she was backslided
[1:31:10] I couldn't call her home
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; because she was not night.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; So that here is God now revealing his
[1:31:21] ways to a prophet.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; To us, we see the acts of God. We we
[1:31:33] want to see manifestation. Oh, we want
[1:31:36] to see the move of God. Oh, that let the
[1:31:38] h let the missing link be replaced. And
[1:31:41] and then we must get bunch OF CRUTCHES
[1:31:44] AND KNOW THAT GOD IS A HEALER.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; God don't heal you one more time. He
[1:31:48] still rem a healer,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; It's not me having an illness and I'm
[1:31:58] praying to God and and and and and I die
[1:32:01] with that illness means that God do not
[1:32:03] heal. God still heals. Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; If I have an illness in my body and I'm
[1:32:10] crying to God and God is not healing ME,
[1:32:13] GOD IS HEALING SOMEBODY ELSE.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:18] How can you think about that in uh in in
[1:32:20] in Texas when brother Brandham lie down
[1:32:22] in that hospital there the uh after the
[1:32:25] accident
[1:32:27] his presence and praying for the people
[1:32:30] they are getting healed when in his body
[1:32:32] he having a broken leg and he would die
[1:32:34] from the accident
[1:32:36] how do you understand that how do you
[1:32:38] explain it
[1:32:41] these are all of the things that uh uh
[1:32:44] uh the human mind don't understand It's
[1:32:47] it's so easy for us to condemn a person.
[1:32:51] It's so easy to think that oh this
[1:32:54] person is fake because if he was a real
[1:32:56] servant of God, he wouldn't have died
[1:32:57] from that.
[1:33:00] We don't understand his ways. His ways
[1:33:03] are passed founding out.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; We limit God to his acts.
[1:33:13] when it's happening when he's doing
[1:33:15] things for us then God is real
[1:33:19] and if we are praying and he's not doing
[1:33:22] the thing there's a lot of question in
[1:33:23] our mind
[1:33:25] it is all because all of those things
[1:33:28] are happening right in our five senses
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; right
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE REALITY OF GOD DROP DOWN IN
[1:33:35] your soul
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; you you will say just like Job though
[1:33:41] he's slaying yet I will trust him
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; because I I don't know what he's doing
[1:33:48] but I know he's in control.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know what he's doing but I know
[1:33:54] he is in control
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to trust him.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; My mind is NOT PROCESSING. MY BODY IS
[1:34:02] failing but my soul trust God. I know
[1:34:05] that God is real.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Glory. Thank you Lord. Are
[1:34:11] we together?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, Brother Brandon
[1:34:14] says, you know, uh uh uh uh we're
[1:34:18] thinking on this in days gone by where
[1:34:20] God moves in a manner and he reveal
[1:34:22] himself to men to make his ways known
[1:34:25] unto men through his servants, the
[1:34:27] prophets. Praise the Lord. Let's look
[1:34:30] let's look at Psalm 81.
[1:34:33] Let's look at Psalm 81. Brother one, you
[1:34:35] got to keep your promise tonight.
[1:34:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:41] It always like that when the time is
[1:34:42] just about to finish that's when I start
[1:34:44] preaching
[1:34:46] do a lot of talking and and Psalm 81.
[1:34:49] Let's let's just look at that very
[1:34:50] quickly and uh
[1:34:54] I will I I will keep your faith
[1:34:56] suspended tonight. You can go and chew
[1:34:59] on those things and pray about it.
[1:35:05] Let's read from verse 10 quickly. I am
[1:35:08] the Lord thy God, which brought thee out
[1:35:10] of the land of Egypt.
[1:35:12] Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,
[1:35:15] but my people will not yaken unto my
[1:35:18] voice.
[1:35:20] And Israel
[1:35:22] will none of me. Open your mouth and I
[1:35:25] will feel it. But if we don't see it,
[1:35:27] then we not open our mouth. We got to
[1:35:30] see it. We got to see what getting in
[1:35:31] our mouth before we open it. You know,
[1:35:34] that's that's how our our five senses
[1:35:36] work.
[1:35:38] Verse 12. So I gave them up unto their
[1:35:42] own hearts. They are lost and they walk
[1:35:46] in their own counsel
[1:35:50] because they were not yaken to the voice
[1:35:51] of God. If there is anything that we
[1:35:54] must believe is God's word.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; We must believe it over our feelings.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; We must believe it over our thoughts and
[1:36:01] imagination. We must believe God's word
[1:36:04] because heaven and earth will pass away.
[1:36:07] This body and all of his senses will
[1:36:09] pass away. But the word of God will
[1:36:11] never pass away
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; because they will not heaken unto my
[1:36:16] voice. I gave them over to their own
[1:36:18] counsel, their own lust. All that my
[1:36:22] people have hecken unto me and Israel
[1:36:26] has walked in my ways.
[1:36:30] all that my people have heakened unto me
[1:36:33] and they will have walked in my ways.
[1:36:35] How will they walk in God's way? God's
[1:36:38] way was not made manifest to them. God's
[1:36:40] way was made known to the prophet. So,
[1:36:43] they should have listened to that man.
[1:36:46] They should have listened to to Moses.
[1:36:50] But they saw him like a natural man.
[1:36:52] They knew his mistakes. They know all of
[1:36:54] his failures.
[1:36:57] But that's that that that's the way God
[1:36:59] is.
[1:37:01] You think that God don't see men in
[1:37:03] their failure before he choose them.
[1:37:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:13] And yet he will come right through the
[1:37:15] weakness of those men and he will use
[1:37:17] them for his purpose just like he will
[1:37:19] do to you and myself.
[1:37:28] Let's take another one. Psalm 95.
[1:37:33] Psalm 95.
[1:37:38] Are we together?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:49] I mean, all of these things have make us
[1:37:51] to just reduce God to our feelings.
[1:37:54] You know, you wake up in the morning,
[1:37:57] you don't feel well, and then it just it
[1:38:00] just, oh, God, where are you? Why am I
[1:38:02] feeling like this?
[1:38:05] And that's the reason why I'm I'm I'm
[1:38:07] I'm still I'm still I'm still trusting
[1:38:10] the Lord to be able to bring to talk
[1:38:13] more on Hebrew chapter 4:12, how the
[1:38:15] word of God shepherd in the two world,
[1:38:18] how he deals with the different parts,
[1:38:20] our spirit, our soul, and our body.
[1:38:24] The word of God is more interested in
[1:38:26] your soul.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; When David prayed, he said, "Restore my
[1:38:30] soul.
[1:38:32] It's the soul that have fallen. The body
[1:38:35] is is a failure. It will rem a failure."
[1:38:40] You have to understand what God is doing
[1:38:43] in in your life.
[1:38:46] What is he doing? What is his purpose?
[1:38:52] Are we together? Psalm 95. Let's let's
[1:38:55] look here quickly. See see what uh uh uh
[1:38:59] David was says.
[1:39:01] Yeah. Um Psalm 95. Let's read from verse
[1:39:04] 6. Oh, come let us worship and bow down.
[1:39:08] Let us kneel
[1:39:09] before the Lord our maker. For he is our
[1:39:13] God and we are his people. and we are
[1:39:16] the people of his pasture and the sheep
[1:39:19] of his hands today. If ye will hear his
[1:39:23] voice,
[1:39:25] harden not your heart as in the
[1:39:28] provocation
[1:39:29] and and as as in in the day of
[1:39:33] temptation in the wilderness when our
[1:39:36] fathers tempted me. God is saying they
[1:39:38] tempted me, they proved me and they saw
[1:39:40] my works and saw my works. 40 years long
[1:39:45] was I grieve with this generation
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; and said
[1:39:51] it is the people that do earth in their
[1:39:54] heart and they have not known my ways
[1:39:58] I'm trying to show my ways to them
[1:40:02] 40 years
[1:40:05] now let's let's let's count our age what
[1:40:08] what what's your age tonight maybe don't
[1:40:10] don't take from the day you were born
[1:40:12] account. Let's let's let's think about h
[1:40:15] since we got saved
[1:40:18] all of this time that the Lord has been
[1:40:20] walking with us,
[1:40:24] we realize that we're just like those
[1:40:25] people in the wilderness
[1:40:30] because it's only when things are are
[1:40:33] happening then we rejoice in the
[1:40:35] victory. When things are happening then
[1:40:37] it looks like we lost. We are asking
[1:40:39] where is God?
[1:40:41] when he promised us that he would not
[1:40:44] leave us and he would not forsake us.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:00] 40 years long.
[1:41:06] Today if you hear my voice, harden not
[1:41:09] your heart.
[1:41:10] harden your heart. In Deuteronomy
[1:41:13] chapter 5, I read that to you some time
[1:41:15] ago. Oh, if my people
[1:41:18] will have such a heart.
[1:41:22] If my people would have such a heart.
[1:41:28] If we would have a heart to say yes
[1:41:30] Lord. If we would have a heart to say be
[1:41:33] it unto me according to your word. If we
[1:41:36] have a heart to say, Lord, your word is
[1:41:39] truth against my best judgment.
[1:41:43] Let every man be a lie and your word
[1:41:47] remain true.
[1:41:49] Are we together?
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Now, tying it to healing, let me read
[1:42:00] this and then we pray.
[1:42:03] for him will I accept. Now here when our
[1:42:07] heavenly father
[1:42:09] yeah at the platform will do something
[1:42:11] in the audience and he will confirm or
[1:42:14] make known his ways or heal somebody or
[1:42:18] something and then you see that that's
[1:42:22] the truth and year people come and
[1:42:25] everything. Now see brother Brandham is
[1:42:27] is tying these things together. God will
[1:42:30] make known his ways. Sometime he make
[1:42:32] known his ways by the discernment by
[1:42:34] telling the people uh uh uh what is
[1:42:37] happening to you in their life and how
[1:42:39] did it come about and when did IT BEGIN.
[1:42:42] WITH ALL of that discernment, this man
[1:42:45] is telling somebody something that
[1:42:47] happened to them when they are small.
[1:42:50] Yet if the prophet don't says you are
[1:42:53] healed, people still don't believe it.
[1:42:56] Even when he says you are healed, you go
[1:42:59] away. There are still people that are in
[1:43:02] the congregation
[1:43:04] that has that is still resenting him.
[1:43:09] They want to see a physical act. They
[1:43:11] want to see a person that is lying on on
[1:43:15] a stretcher jumping up out of the bed.
[1:43:19] And even with all of that,
[1:43:24] we still have to come back to the
[1:43:26] service the next time again to to to see
[1:43:29] another miracle.
[1:43:33] All of those things is just show
[1:43:38] where how the heart of man
[1:43:41] is far away from God.
[1:43:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:48] I mean with some of the things that the
[1:43:49] Lord has done in our individual life,
[1:43:54] we must be at a place of where we will
[1:43:56] never have a question to ask him why
[1:44:03] to know that it is the grace of God that
[1:44:05] has brought us this far.
[1:44:11] But you see the children of Israel only
[1:44:14] known God by his eyes. And that's what
[1:44:17] this generation is. That's what this
[1:44:19] religious people are. And that's the
[1:44:22] reason why when I see uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:44:27] uh Jesus said the signs will follow them
[1:44:30] that believe. But when I see people
[1:44:33] trying to promote signs and wonders,
[1:44:37] trying to look for some personal
[1:44:39] vindication that God has given me a
[1:44:42] healing ministry,
[1:44:43] the word heals. The Bible say while
[1:44:45] Jesus taught the word, the people were
[1:44:47] healed.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; I don't have to come and pray for sick
[1:44:55] for you to believe that I'm a servant of
[1:44:57] God. If if you don't believe it, if you
[1:44:59] I mean you're not convinced that God is
[1:45:01] uh you know uh uh uh uh uh ministering
[1:45:05] through my humble ministry, I mean then
[1:45:07] that's up to you. I don't I don't I'm
[1:45:09] not bashing at people. They are brothers
[1:45:11] that that God has blessed in those
[1:45:13] different area. I'm not bashing at them.
[1:45:15] But what I'm trying to tell you is that
[1:45:18] we cannot major on it.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Divine healing is the manner.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; We cannot major on the manner.
[1:45:27] The thing that any father will want from
[1:45:30] a child is for that child to be able to
[1:45:33] understand his ways.
[1:45:37] That when a father says, "Uh, I'll get
[1:45:40] it for you. I don't have to ask him when
[1:45:45] he don't have to come home and I run to
[1:45:47] him, daddy, did you got it for me?" I
[1:45:50] have to believe when he say he will get
[1:45:51] it for me, he will get it for me.
[1:45:55] And I think that God want us for us to
[1:45:58] know him because God is known by his
[1:46:00] characteristics.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; He want us to know him that he's the God
[1:46:07] that is faithful to his word.
[1:46:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:17] And if we know God by his ways, we will
[1:46:21] know that he was the one that raised up
[1:46:24] a brazing serpent in the wilderness.
[1:46:28] He was the one that raised up a brazing
[1:46:31] serpent and told the people to look to
[1:46:33] the brazing serpent.
[1:46:35] Amen. And they would be healed of their
[1:46:38] diseases. And we know God by his ways. I
[1:46:41] mean uh with everything that is
[1:46:44] happening around the country and and
[1:46:46] health insurance we will not we will not
[1:46:48] get trouble.
[1:46:51] I mean it will be time where we will
[1:46:53] want to call Jesus on the scene
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; and say Lord you are my healer. you are
[1:47:00] my deliverer
[1:47:06] because God saw things right from time
[1:47:09] before they even happened.
[1:47:12] I just pray that God can be able to just
[1:47:15] raise people faith where they will
[1:47:17] really believe in God.
[1:47:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:27] that he's the one that healed our
[1:47:29] diseases.
[1:47:32] And he said, "Oh, he forgaveth all of
[1:47:34] our iniquity.
[1:47:36] He healed all of our diseases."
[1:47:40] And the psalmist says, "Do not forget
[1:47:42] his benefits." These are the things that
[1:47:45] he have done for you. Now it's left with
[1:47:48] you
[1:47:50] to believe it or live under the
[1:47:53] privilege
[1:47:57] because that's that's what the age is.
[1:48:00] We're always looking for God in his eyes
[1:48:03] but his ways has been made known to us.
[1:48:05] A prophet has brought us a message.
[1:48:09] He said the bride know the man of Christ
[1:48:13] and she know what to do with it.
[1:48:19] knowing that God have a purpose. Why he
[1:48:22] allow things to happen.
[1:48:24] Why he allow us to forsake. Why he allow
[1:48:27] us to go through one thing, one thing or
[1:48:29] the other.
[1:48:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:34] I mean uh
[1:48:37] just this couple of time traveling I
[1:48:39] really had a good trip and really had a
[1:48:42] good meeting. Well, when I got back, my
[1:48:45] whole body was almost like tearing apart
[1:48:48] and uh and you know, but I just knew
[1:48:51] that, well, I'm going to be fine.
[1:48:55] Yeah. Knew that. Well, I kind of
[1:48:57] overused myself. I just I don't have to
[1:48:59] make everything the devil. I mean, we
[1:49:01] sing the devil name so much until he
[1:49:03] think he's winning the battle.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Sometime just know him as if he's not
[1:49:10] even there.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:13] Let's bow our house together tonight.
[1:49:34] I want God's way to be my way as I
[1:49:36] travel here below. Let's B has him pray.
[1:49:40] Heavenly Father,

[1:49:45] little exitation Lord just to remind the

[1:49:55] thoughts, Lord,

[1:50:07] and all of these men. of God. Father,
[1:50:09] they brought they brought uh uh uh your
[1:50:13] divine purpose to the people.

[1:50:24] your your your your
[1:50:27] election to see your love that is
[1:50:30] expressed to them by election.
[1:50:33] And the people are asking him how how
[1:50:36] can you say that God love us? see what
[1:50:38] we are doing. We just came from out of
[1:50:39] Babylon.
