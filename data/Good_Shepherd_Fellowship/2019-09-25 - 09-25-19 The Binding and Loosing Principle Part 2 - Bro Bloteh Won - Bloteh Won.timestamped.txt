[1:00:13] you praise the Lord and I'm going to
[1:00:21] trust the law to light in the direction
[1:00:23] we're going to God amen
[1:00:26] I've been certain Sunday we were gonna
[1:00:31] start speaking on all that the father
[1:00:34] has given me and kind of thinking now
[1:00:40] just meditating preparing for the
[1:00:42] service and the Lord start dealing with
[1:00:47] my heart on something in and I started
[1:00:50] thinking about it and looking in the
[1:00:51] word a little bit so I might just you
[1:00:56] know give it to the law to nineteen eyes
[1:00:58] that he would come and bless us in a
[1:01:00] special way praising me but we want to
[1:01:05] thank the Lord for His goodness and His
[1:01:08] mercy
[1:01:10] you know sometimes God will inspire us
[1:01:14] you know leaders in a setting Direction
[1:01:20] sometimes you would be wondering why
[1:01:23] didn't you know you just but even as a
[1:01:29] preacher you preach the word and yet you
[1:01:34] know you go home and then go start
[1:01:36] dealing with you personally and you just
[1:01:40] a saying oh my goodness what you know
[1:01:43] what what a beautiful thing in you know
[1:01:46] needing more of God's grace I'll say
[1:01:49] this tonight just just in the space of
[1:01:52] the week you know there was those some
[1:01:57] few things that happen and really kind
[1:01:59] of there with me personally too and
[1:02:03] Sunday we just you know but every told
[1:02:06] me he was having an interview on Monday
[1:02:09] and I just said it from the back of the
[1:02:12] Pope reading you know actually we pray
[1:02:15] for him and I know in time pass he has
[1:02:19] sheer you know some personal things you
[1:02:23] know I mean birding in and he desired if
[1:02:28] if it is the word of the Lord you know
[1:02:30] he would like to to use many sorta like
[1:02:35] the backside of the desert you know I
[1:02:39] get a job and stay here and and you know
[1:02:42] brother Ariel he has travelled a little
[1:02:45] bit around the country and
[1:02:50] you know he's a nice young man it's a
[1:02:52] good musician there are many many big
[1:02:55] churches that want for him to to be
[1:02:58] there you know so when he told me that
[1:03:01] is where I would just pray you know you
[1:03:06] know so and then he would say that to me
[1:03:11] after him you know every time we talk he
[1:03:14] would say there to me often well you
[1:03:16] know I never really took it like trying
[1:03:19] to flatter me but I just say well you
[1:03:21] know because there is one thing I
[1:03:23] believe like a preacher is God that
[1:03:25] plains people he men and gods Plains
[1:03:28] people in the sword that he knows that
[1:03:30] it's good for you
[1:03:32] he might out roots you from one place
[1:03:34] and plains you to another place but it
[1:03:37] has to be in the right season I believe
[1:03:39] that I mean we even talked about that
[1:03:42] some time ago and you know he was trying
[1:03:44] to share that with meaning and you know
[1:03:47] and so but Monday he went for his job
[1:03:52] interview and then he called me and they
[1:03:56] are talking to call me and after the
[1:03:58] interview I wanted to know how he gold
[1:04:00] and he called me and told me you know of
[1:04:02] the interview went well and but then he
[1:04:07] told me something that I can afford
[1:04:08] challenged my faith it ominous is a well
[1:04:15] it's a bird wanna mind my permit work
[1:04:20] pay me that was given to me after my
[1:04:23] study were expire on Friday I got it I
[1:04:30] got a I got a wishes this coming Friday
[1:04:33] I got a letter from the school and even
[1:04:36] you know from from the immigration and
[1:04:39] and you know and they keep asking why
[1:04:42] why Hawaii not find a job yet and and in
[1:04:46] order that I don't want to go into some
[1:04:48] different things let me just stay where
[1:04:50] I am
[1:04:51] you know I know we talked about it and
[1:04:54] he just kept telling me well I think the
[1:04:56] Lord is trying my patience you know but
[1:04:59] I think the law was giving him patience
[1:05:05] praise the Lord
[1:05:06] and so when he said that to me it was
[1:05:10] just like the light came on and I was
[1:05:14] saying to myself I said oh my goodness
[1:05:16] this brother have told me over and over
[1:05:19] you know he would love to find a job
[1:05:22] here in and you know stay here until the
[1:05:25] Lord can leave him X word and I you know
[1:05:30] I really never took time to pray about
[1:05:32] it I mean I mean set a time aside and
[1:05:36] just prayed about it
[1:05:38] and realizing that his job dammit will
[1:05:41] be we aspired on on on Friday if we
[1:05:46] either be that he would either have to
[1:05:48] go back to school or maybe he would have
[1:05:52] to I don't know why I'm not an
[1:05:55] immigration officer you know so we
[1:06:03] talked a little bit and after we dropped
[1:06:05] the phone
[1:06:06] I really felt challenged see my heart I
[1:06:09] said I felt a little bit guilty and and
[1:06:13] I'm saying to myself dear I'm saying
[1:06:16] yura said I've been preaching on the
[1:06:18] bounding power and our power is the
[1:06:22] keeping power and if it'll if it's left
[1:06:27] with me I love to keep him here
[1:06:33] and why - I use that since and I just
[1:06:38] started praying about it I just I just
[1:06:41] repented to the Lord and said father you
[1:06:44] know just you know and because I don't
[1:06:47] like I don't like pulling on people
[1:06:49] personally I like to for it to be a
[1:06:52] revelation
[1:06:52] you know like a conviction you know and
[1:06:56] so I prayed about it and all through the
[1:07:00] week I would just you know think about
[1:07:01] reading and just oh God
[1:07:04] you know you have to do something this
[1:07:06] young man you know
[1:07:07] stated high school you know finish
[1:07:10] college and can't find a job law you
[1:07:13] know how he trusted you and you know he
[1:07:16] did the best thing that he could do you
[1:07:19] know and everything and I was just
[1:07:20] praying so I talked this morning after
[1:07:23] we got to praying and we prayed about at
[1:07:25] home as well
[1:07:26] I'm gonna call Burt a scab a car better
[1:07:30] scale I would talk to him
[1:07:31] well he said he knows people around you
[1:07:34] know but what would happen this is
[1:07:36] Wednesday today this Wednesday and it's
[1:07:39] Friday the job he made will expire and
[1:07:42] between Wednesday even if he has an
[1:07:45] interview on Thursday they have to look
[1:07:47] at everything and decide so thinking on
[1:07:51] that as soon as I came out of the
[1:07:53] elevator he called me so I was just
[1:07:56] thinking about this young man he called
[1:07:57] me and and he just told me I got the job

[1:08:10] there I could break about affair so
[1:08:13] sorry for myself you know and I like I
[1:08:21] tell people we go through things and and
[1:08:25] and and and many times we go through
[1:08:28] those things
[1:08:30] and the law bring us out from the
[1:08:34] beginning to the end if we really want
[1:08:37] to be sincere you look in the middle you
[1:08:40] get nothing to be praised for praise the
[1:08:45] Lord because sometimes we don't have the
[1:08:47] right attitude when we go in through the
[1:08:50] stage because we don't understand it
[1:08:53] amen all right I mean I would just don't

[1:17:57] familiar with with the chapter and when
[1:18:02] she came to the man of God on the hill
[1:18:06] she caught him by the feet but the haze
[1:18:12] I came now to trust her the way and the
[1:18:15] man of God said let her alone for her
[1:18:19] soul is vexed within her and the Lord
[1:18:23] had hid it from me and have now told me
[1:18:28] then she said that I desire a son of my
[1:18:35] lord dead and I said do not deceive me
[1:18:41] then he said to the Hazel gate of the
[1:18:46] lens and take my staff in the hand and

[1:18:55] him there and if any salute thee answer

[1:19:06] upon the face of the child as chapter 19
[1:19:34] ass chapter 19
[1:19:47] first eleven and God brought special
[1:19:50] miracles by the hands of Paul so that
[1:19:55] from his body were brought on to the
[1:19:59] sake handkerchiefs or apron and the
[1:20:03] diseases departed from them and the evil
[1:20:06] spirit went out of them Amy let's pray
[1:20:11] father we want to thank you tonight once
[1:20:13] again Lord you are the one father that
[1:20:18] has provided this love that can pardon

[1:20:25] yet you meet our knees Lord a strength
[1:20:28] Lord that comes from you Almighty God we
[1:20:32] commit ourselves to be now for the word
[1:20:35] that we have read we want to pray that
[1:20:37] the Holy Spirit who take complete
[1:20:39] control tonight bless us father in Jesus
[1:20:43] name we pray amen
[1:20:46] Amy Allah bless you may have you see
[1:20:56] it's hard to close on inspiration when
[1:20:58] it's on your heart annoying and God is
[1:21:02] just just dealing with you on it and
[1:21:05] it's just it's hard to to get away from
[1:21:08] it and what I was thinking about as I
[1:21:14] look to the scripture over here in the
[1:21:23] book of Acts is the beginning of the
[1:21:25] efficient church praise the Lord and in
[1:21:30] this efficient church actually begins
[1:21:35] like verse one who tells us there when
[1:21:39] Paul met Apollo's and he met this man
[1:21:50] that was baptized by John the Baptist
[1:21:53] you think about it now John the Baptist
[1:21:57] came preaching a message of repentance
[1:21:59] the voice of one crying in the
[1:22:01] wilderness and calling the people unto
[1:22:05] repentance praise the Lord
[1:22:07] another joint message right at the river
[1:22:12] the Pharisees sent their spokesman our
[1:22:16] investigators to go and ask John if he
[1:22:19] was the Messiah he said no I was not the
[1:22:22] Messiah and he identified himself with
[1:22:25] the prophecy of Isaiah and different
[1:22:27] prophecies in the Bible but then John
[1:22:31] also testified when he said there is one
[1:22:34] among you
[1:22:35] amen in a sense there is one among us
[1:22:39] and I believe there is one among us
[1:22:42] tonight
[1:22:43] praise the Lord there is one among you
[1:22:46] whose shoe lashes I'm now watered to
[1:22:49] lose praise the Lord
[1:22:51] amen John was actually identifying that
[1:22:55] that the Messiah was there why because
[1:22:58] back in the wilderness the Lord told him
[1:23:02] that amen and-and-and-and all of these
[1:23:06] his disciples and the people that
[1:23:09] follow him there you know the the hell
[1:23:12] his preaching and I mean John was a man
[1:23:15] that the heart message with our
[1:23:18] compromising amen
[1:23:19] we know the story how he went into the
[1:23:22] wilderness at nine years oh he came out
[1:23:24] at the age of Terry praise the Lord
[1:23:27] and and and this boy that I mean he was
[1:23:30] taught by God God taught him in the
[1:23:33] school of nature praise the Lord and he
[1:23:36] came out and now even fear in the faces
[1:23:38] of the people that will come to his
[1:23:40] meeting praise the Lord he talked to
[1:23:43] Harold right in his face and said it's
[1:23:45] not lawful for you to take your
[1:23:46] brother's wife amen and and I mean in in
[1:23:51] I mean in people John had a message they
[1:23:56] had the burning power now you think
[1:23:58] about it that was even before the the
[1:24:02] Holy Ghost was given but year when John
[1:24:05] preaches his message it was it was I
[1:24:09] mean it was enough to keep people in
[1:24:12] their tracks praise the Lord and I don't
[1:24:18] know where Apollo's was when John
[1:24:23] introduced Jesus Christ that day and he
[1:24:26] said behold the lamb of God that takes
[1:24:29] away the sin of the world and we
[1:24:31] realized it was that day that Andrews
[1:24:34] and and and another follow Jesus prays
[1:24:37] alone but yet there was people that
[1:24:40] stayed on the John ministry and I
[1:24:43] believe Apollo's was one of them because
[1:24:45] he never even knew about Jesus I mean he
[1:24:49] never even knew about the one that
[1:24:51] joined him to introduce and he was
[1:24:54] faithful to join ministry even after
[1:24:57] John was taken of the scene praise the
[1:25:02] Lord
[1:25:03] I mean he was so kept by this word he
[1:25:07] was kept by the revival he was kept by
[1:25:11] the things that he heard on the River
[1:25:13] Jordan or wherever John was preaching
[1:25:16] kept him all of those years even when
[1:25:21] John was thinking of the scene
[1:25:23] Jesus came into his ministry I policy
[1:25:26] were he was there believing to see the
[1:25:30] Messiah believing to see the things that
[1:25:32] John preached but he never came across
[1:25:35] Jesus it's almost like the both of them
[1:25:38] were going in parallel a direction and
[1:25:42] he could he meet praise the Lord and yet
[1:25:48] Paul comes to this place in him he met
[1:25:52] this man and he realized that there is
[1:25:54] something about this man he's holding
[1:25:57] something this man have a truth
[1:26:00] experience but yet he don't know
[1:26:02] anything about the Holy Ghost praise the
[1:26:06] Lord
[1:26:08] amen the Word of God would keep you
[1:26:16] there is enough power in this world to
[1:26:19] keep you to keep you in your trials
[1:26:23] amen praise the Lord but this is what I
[1:26:30] want for us to look at tonight so John
[1:26:33] Paul comes here and then he introduced
[1:26:39] the Lord Jesus we know the story of Paul
[1:26:45] also he acts this man have you received
[1:26:49] the Holy Ghost you see I've never heard
[1:26:51] anything about the Holy Ghost wow man
[1:26:53] you have not heard anything about the
[1:26:56] Holy Ghost and you have such a devotion
[1:26:59] you have social life
[1:27:03] praise the Lord then if you have the
[1:27:07] Holy Ghost what are you going to do then
[1:27:09] praise the Lord
[1:27:11] so right here and I Paul you know told
[1:27:16] them about the Lord Jesus baptized them
[1:27:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:27:21] and they received the Holy Ghost praise
[1:27:24] the Lord Amen now Paul realize you know
[1:27:28] when I was talking on the message born
[1:27:30] at midnight I Pulis was one of those
[1:27:33] people are hiding my mind to talk about
[1:27:34] because he was born
[1:27:37] another revival but because he had a
[1:27:40] truth experience on earth a revival a
[1:27:42] kept him for the next revival praise the
[1:27:48] Lord because he had a truth experience
[1:27:51] he had he had a birth he had a
[1:27:54] conviction he he understood that when
[1:27:56] John when John said repent of your sin I
[1:27:59] mean John were getting a street and you
[1:28:01] will meet the tax collectors and he were
[1:28:03] accident to repent stop being stopped
[1:28:06] being caught up in corruption praise the
[1:28:10] Lord
[1:28:15] but our palace was born after midnight
[1:28:18] because he was he was net in Jesus
[1:28:22] revival praise the Lord
[1:28:25] but he had a birth and it kept him for
[1:28:32] the next revival are we together praise
[1:28:37] the Lord
[1:28:37] so but after a year we see here that
[1:28:41] when when when he received the Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost and and in everything and then
[1:28:47] Paul decided to stay right here with
[1:28:50] these people that was the birth of the
[1:28:52] efficient Church amen
[1:28:54] Paul stay right there with those people
[1:28:58] and then he taught them in the word and
[1:29:00] the scripture when I had and he led us
[1:29:03] to know yet in verse 7 and verse 6 and
[1:29:08] when Paul haar lay hands upon them the
[1:29:10] Holy Ghost came on them and they speak
[1:29:13] with tongues and prophesied and all the
[1:29:16] men were about 12 so the efficient
[1:29:19] church was born with twelve members in
[1:29:23] that church that was the beginning of
[1:29:28] the efficient church are we together
[1:29:34] Amen taking sides of Jesus brother
[1:29:36] Burnham also said that that and and and
[1:29:39] Paul spent some time with these people
[1:29:42] if you read the scripture down a little
[1:29:43] bit you will see we get in there and the
[1:29:46] Bible says and he went into the
[1:29:47] synagogue and speak boiling
[1:29:49] for the space of three months disputing
[1:29:53] and and he stayed there with those
[1:29:56] people now this is the beginning of the
[1:30:00] efficient Church that that's what I want
[1:30:02] to I want to establish here and but I
[1:30:06] want to show I want to bring out
[1:30:07] something here
[1:30:09] better Branham says God keep his word
[1:30:11] and I don't have it updated like I said
[1:30:14] I didn't send any note back there but
[1:30:16] just follow me tonight he says did you
[1:30:18] notice in a Bible a few minutes now Paul
[1:30:20] didn't have and in trouble with their
[1:30:23] with the church at Ephesus
[1:30:25] there was Khalid why these people like I
[1:30:28] said they had an experience amen praise
[1:30:33] the Lord they had an experience from
[1:30:36] from from from honor
[1:30:39] Jones revival praise the Lord they were
[1:30:43] looking into the scripture that was the
[1:30:46] thing that attracted poor to them there
[1:30:50] was something about these people are we
[1:30:53] together he says there were scholars
[1:30:57] there were men who understood but his
[1:31:00] trouble was in with the the Roman Church
[1:31:03] and he assaulted them before God and he
[1:31:08] talks of their faith but that but the
[1:31:11] trouble he had was waived with the
[1:31:14] Corinthians the Corinthians was the
[1:31:17] place that he had trouble for they could
[1:31:20] not take the word each one wanted a
[1:31:24] sensation amen
[1:31:28] what is it when I come and warn you Paul
[1:31:31] says one God a tongue and one goddess a
[1:31:35] man one God this all dead some kind of a
[1:31:39] little little foolish sensation he said
[1:31:44] you you believers but you are not
[1:31:48] established established word in the
[1:31:51] world now you have to know their gifts
[1:31:55] and calling our with our repentance amen
[1:31:59] the Corinthians were not established in
[1:32:02] a world but there were the P
[1:32:04] put the hi gifts praise the Lord
[1:32:09] so that that's the problem that Paul was
[1:32:11] having with him he was seeing the
[1:32:16] manifestation of true give him on the
[1:32:19] people and what what in the balance that
[1:32:24] Paul was trying to bring the Corinthians
[1:32:26] church is that every gift must come
[1:32:29] under the word amen gifts don't control
[1:32:34] the word is the word that controls the
[1:32:36] gift are we together praise the Lord
[1:32:42] but you think about it this church and
[1:32:45] that how all of this problem yet it was
[1:32:49] the it was the most gifted church if we
[1:32:54] never had the Corinthian church we will
[1:32:57] never had an order of how the gift must
[1:32:59] manifest among us because Paul never
[1:33:02] taught that in the ephesian church he
[1:33:04] never taught that in the painting in the
[1:33:07] Roman Church he had to teach it where
[1:33:09] the problem was
[1:33:12] praise the Lord
[1:33:13] gifted people always have problem amen
[1:33:19] no it's a truth why because the devil is
[1:33:24] to destroy thy gift amen
[1:33:27] if the devil can can can can trouble the
[1:33:31] people that has a gift and call him from
[1:33:34] God and put them to the place worthy I
[1:33:37] even confused of what God has given to
[1:33:39] them then you can never use it I mean if
[1:33:44] he can ever get you to the place for you
[1:33:46] to doubt what God has given to you
[1:33:48] you're never going to use it are we
[1:33:55] together so that was one of the people
[1:33:58] and and and and what Paul was trying to
[1:34:02] do was to establish him in the word now
[1:34:05] you know Paul who do you have preached
[1:34:07] things to the to the Corinthian church
[1:34:10] and come back and preach it to the the
[1:34:14] efficient church or something like that
[1:34:16] in the Church of Thessalonica
[1:34:17] and and and and something as he preached
[1:34:20] the same gospel everywhere but that
[1:34:24] efficient Church he he could speak to
[1:34:28] them some of the great mystery now the
[1:34:33] thing I'm trying to bring here tonight
[1:34:35] is to tell you they're tough you don't
[1:34:40] don't despise your ally beginning don't
[1:34:50] despise the things that God do in your
[1:34:54] life when he's dealing with you praise
[1:35:00] the Lord Amen because he dared he dare
[1:35:07] waved I pull-ups when this sad on a
[1:35:11] joint ministry just imagine it was just
[1:35:14] a six-month ministry John had a
[1:35:17] six-month ministry to introduce the
[1:35:19] Messiah and you think about it as six
[1:35:23] more minutes trick will keep a man for
[1:35:28] that amount of years amen
[1:35:34] a six more ministry can impart a man's
[1:35:39] life that's why brother Branham says
[1:35:46] Paul will go to a place and just and
[1:35:48] just bring one soul to God and then when
[1:35:52] he comes back he can see teddy
[1:35:56] amen because for the matter of fat
[1:36:00] people like the prophet of God says
[1:36:03] every man must have the opportunity to
[1:36:06] hear the gospel once it takes just one
[1:36:08] preaching to change your life praise the
[1:36:13] Lord
[1:36:14] it takes one preaching for God to talk
[1:36:18] to be able to quicken that seed in you
[1:36:21] all the rest will just be water and
[1:36:25] sunshine for the sea to grow praise the
[1:36:29] Lord
[1:36:30] but
[1:36:30] took one preaching to make the cross
[1:36:33] rear to you
[1:36:35] it took one preaching to make this
[1:36:39] gospel truth to you praise the Lord
[1:36:43] and that's where the anchor holes and
[1:36:51] Paul I mean John revival kept these
[1:36:55] people for all of these years Paul came
[1:36:59] down there and saw what was happening he
[1:37:04] spent some time with them and different
[1:37:08] things was happening there now tonight I
[1:37:11] want to drive into another direction
[1:37:14] here with this whole thing that is on my
[1:37:16] mind and the scripture says as Paul
[1:37:22] there was a lot of miracles
[1:37:24] that was performed different things were
[1:37:26] happening right there in that little
[1:37:29] church of a people that knew who called
[1:37:33] him I mean the knew this was the
[1:37:39] efficient church where Paul says God
[1:37:41] have chosen you from the foundation of
[1:37:43] the world the book of efficient we write
[1:37:46] it is this church that Paul was
[1:37:48] preaching those things though they knew
[1:37:50] their place in Christ and Bertram says
[1:37:57] the reason why Paul preached those
[1:38:00] things to the efficient church is for
[1:38:02] them not to feel saved today and
[1:38:05] tomorrow they feel us he was trying to
[1:38:09] work out from their mind that God do not
[1:38:12] lost what he has saved amen now all the
[1:38:22] father has given me we come and there is
[1:38:25] no man that can pluck them out of my
[1:38:27] hands that's what he was trying to get
[1:38:33] get away from him listen to this Abraham
[1:38:39] he says no man can come to me except my
[1:38:41] father draw him first
[1:38:43] Oh
[1:38:43] all the father has given me we come
[1:38:45] there you are
[1:38:47] so when you have their leaves little
[1:38:51] twinkling in your heart to come to
[1:38:54] Christ you do a right away because
[1:38:58] that's the greatest thing that we ever
[1:39:01] happened to you it's for God to call you
[1:39:05] to the wedding supper of his son I don't
[1:39:11] know anything greater are we together
[1:39:18] amen and Paul says right there he works
[1:39:25] with the people different things started
[1:39:28] happening in that church because the
[1:39:31] people were standing on the word but
[1:39:35] this we read where the scripture says
[1:39:38] and from his body were brought on to the
[1:39:42] sick handshake handkerchiefs in April
[1:39:45] and the diseases departed from them and
[1:39:49] the evil spirit went out of him now that
[1:39:52] was the thing that was just on my mind
[1:39:54] and I was thinking about it you know and
[1:39:59] brother Branham says Paul actually got
[1:40:03] that example from the scripture we read
[1:40:05] in the Old Testament
[1:40:08] for him to give prayer cloth out to
[1:40:13] people for him to pray for those cloth
[1:40:16] and give it out to people for them to
[1:40:19] cast our spirits he says Paul got that
[1:40:23] from Elijah experience of giving Gehenna
[1:40:29] his staff to go and lay it on the bone
[1:40:34] now you have to remember Paul never I
[1:40:38] mean enlarger never went and cut a tree
[1:40:43] branch and says I cut this tree branches
[1:40:48] and Lord Jesus just just bless this tree
[1:40:52] branch as as I guess I go and lay the
[1:40:55] flower on this little boy
[1:40:57] Laure bring his life back now this was
[1:41:01] Elijah's task
[1:41:03] I mean it was Elijah's property it was
[1:41:08] something that was with Elijah
[1:41:12] praise the Lord amen
[1:41:15] it was something that was with Elijah
[1:41:17] just like when God met Moses at the
[1:41:21] burning bush and he said what is in your
[1:41:23] hands
[1:41:23] there was Moses staff I mean it was what
[1:41:29] Moses was using to lead his sheeps and
[1:41:32] he was using it to climb up the mountain
[1:41:34] and I mean it was his time he depended
[1:41:38] on it in some way
[1:41:40] praise the Lord now what am I trying to
[1:41:44] draw to us tonight the binding power
[1:41:49] that that poor we take this inspiration
[1:41:55] there something that Elijah had like a
[1:42:00] star that was caught out of an armored
[1:42:02] tree and-and-and-and because those staff
[1:42:05] they are made from a fresh ammo tree the
[1:42:10] tree has to be a living tree it's not a
[1:42:12] dead stick they had caught it from a
[1:42:14] living tree amen and keep it and and
[1:42:18] then that you know the the leaders in
[1:42:22] the tree in in in a stick makes it to be
[1:42:26] stronger amen
[1:42:27] not a tree not a stake the force of the
[1:42:29] tree there is no life in it praise the
[1:42:32] Lord
[1:42:32] but when the color of the treat it's
[1:42:36] still fresh
[1:42:37] praise the Lord amen that's how they
[1:42:41] make your staff now so it has to be
[1:42:43] caught off a live tree it's not a dead
[1:42:45] stick lying on the ground so while to
[1:42:48] realize that a Elijah would take
[1:42:52] something from there has been with him
[1:42:57] something that is his praise the Lord
[1:43:01] amen now you think about that it's
[1:43:05] almost like brother branham right there
[1:43:07] embalming praying for that blind man and
[1:43:10] he take on his
[1:43:12] amen he never says Oh Bella poor Jack
[1:43:16] McGaw down the road and buy me in the
[1:43:18] shoes let me give it to this one he want
[1:43:19] to give the man his shoes why because he
[1:43:26] warded it has been in his presence he
[1:43:30] know what he had done with it he know
[1:43:33] where he has taken their shoes amen
[1:43:39] praise the Lord are we together follow
[1:43:43] me now Parabellum says i see many people
[1:43:46] they were annoyed they were annoyed or
[1:43:49] and I mean annoyed the close with
[1:43:52] anointing or and and and going pray for
[1:43:55] he says I don't have any me and a
[1:43:56] problem he says but that is not
[1:43:58] scriptural
[1:43:58] I mean Elijah never had to anoint that
[1:44:06] that or Elijah never had to annoy the
[1:44:09] stake Oh Elijah needed was something
[1:44:14] that live in his presence that's the
[1:44:17] life of the believer praise the Lord
[1:44:22] Oh in the church just if we if we value
[1:44:28] the Holy Ghost that's been given to the
[1:44:31] church as a keeping power as a cleansing
[1:44:34] power if we value that and to know that
[1:44:38] that Holy Ghost our doors in our body we
[1:44:42] use our clothes our shoes and different
[1:44:44] things to dress up ourself that as long
[1:44:47] as we keep it in that Center firing
[1:44:50] presence there was the confidence that a
[1:44:54] larger God
[1:44:56] Elijah had in that raw praise the Lord
[1:45:01] that was the that was the confidence he
[1:45:04] had that this rod has been right here
[1:45:07] when I'm calling on Jehovah when I'm
[1:45:10] going to church this roar goes with me
[1:45:12] to church this rod has been in the
[1:45:16] presence of God make the atmosphere that
[1:45:19] I create around
[1:45:22] Tracy Lord amen
[1:45:26] now before the word turned into oughta
[1:45:30] be a charity thing where people send
[1:45:35] things over overseas that was the way of
[1:45:39] the early church just like how Paul took
[1:45:45] his inspiration from Elijah the le
[1:45:48] church took this inspiration they would
[1:45:50] take their clothes and they would pray
[1:45:53] it over it not honor to send it to help
[1:45:58] people that don't have claws but they
[1:46:00] believe that when those people wear
[1:46:02] those clothes because they have left
[1:46:05] centerfire lives in those claws
[1:46:07] it will bring healing on the people and
[1:46:09] it will bring salvation to sauce
[1:46:17] pressure Lord amen why didn't why didn't
[1:46:27] God asked Moses for something else but
[1:46:37] God acts him for what he had in his
[1:46:38] hands amen and the Lord knew what Moses
[1:46:45] has been using it for are we together
[1:46:54] praise the Lord that was that was the
[1:47:00] that was the approach of the early
[1:47:02] church
[1:47:08] just like the testimony enough when when
[1:47:12] Jesus died on the cross and those Roman
[1:47:16] soldiers gamble because of his wrong you
[1:47:20] think about that you just think about it
[1:47:24] and whoever took that raw that he had
[1:47:29] around him you think about it what our
[1:47:34] Lord Jesus cross around his shoulder
[1:47:37] when he was healing his sake you think
[1:47:41] about it
[1:47:42] that is the reason why they could cut
[1:47:45] brother branham suits his pains and his
[1:47:49] cut into pieces to use it for prayer
[1:47:52] cloth praise the Lord
[1:48:12] but Brenham says we have enough holy
[1:48:14] ghost just to bring us to church and
[1:48:19] some time enough Holy Ghost just to stop
[1:48:21] lying
[1:48:22] but God want to fill our fibers of our
[1:48:27] body the fiber of our body
[1:48:32] praise Lord until you can give a shirt
[1:48:38] to a poor man down the street amen and
[1:48:44] say Lord try to live a clean life in
[1:48:47] that shirt I praise you in that shirt I
[1:48:51] fail your presence in that shirt praise
[1:48:59] the Lord amen
[1:49:04] and that's the reason why when the
[1:49:08] priest was called into the priesthood
[1:49:13] his tongue was anointed signifying the
[1:49:19] things that he would touch and his big
[1:49:23] toes were anointed signifying the places
[1:49:26] that he would go sometimes we want to
[1:49:32] leave our Holy Ghost in church leave our
[1:49:36] Holy Ghost at home but Holy Ghost want
[1:49:39] to go with you everywhere you go
[1:49:44] praise the Lord
[1:49:46] amen because it's a life it's not a
[1:49:49] religion it's a life these things down
[1:50:01] there in in Acts chapter 19 then we'll
[1:50:07] take all of these ear prongs their their
[1:50:09] clothing and just come and put it before
[1:50:12] Paul praise the Lord
[1:50:18] and he will he
[1:50:19] preyed upon it he would keep it in that
[1:50:22] annoy to clean atmosphere and they would
[1:50:27] take it and go and give it to sick
[1:50:29] people and the evil spirit will leave
[1:50:31] them praise the Lord
[1:50:42] it was not a clothes that was doing the
[1:50:46] work
[1:50:46] it was the atmosphere that it was kept
[1:50:50] in praise the Lord
[1:50:54] it was the atmosphere that it was kept
[1:50:57] in and God will use these things you
[1:51:10] know he will use these things off praise
[1:51:16] the Lord Amen that is the reason why you
[1:51:20] know we brother Branham says you know
[1:51:22] our our men done don't dress like the
[1:51:24] word because we believe God use our
[1:51:28] clothes he says our women don't you know
[1:51:32] they don't dress like the word they
[1:51:34] don't wear pants they don't expose their
[1:51:35] body because we believe that that's the
[1:51:38] presence that we are carrying there's a
[1:51:43] presence that must be contained and it
[1:51:47] must be contained right
[1:51:52] praise the Lord when addressing after
[1:51:57] the fashion of the word we are dressing
[1:52:01] after the fashion of God's Word
[1:52:07] you think about it how how these people
[1:52:14] believe even in the things that we use
[1:52:17] you know the things that they use when I
[1:52:23] was a cop whether it was a board but to
[1:52:30] be able to send the presence of God with
[1:52:36] just your pain I'm sounding like her
[1:52:41] like her Pentecostal preacher tonight
[1:52:44] but I'm not afraid to say I'm one Amen
[1:52:49] oh yeah because I believe God's presence
[1:52:54] goes with those things if we keep him in
[1:53:00] the right atmosphere praise the Lord
[1:53:04] yes Porter's you know like like I like I
[1:53:08] told you one time you know in its
[1:53:09] inspiration that's what verb random
[1:53:11] Bourbon says the woman that taught in
[1:53:14] her mind and see if I only touch His
[1:53:16] garment there was not a structure for
[1:53:18] that it was just an inspiration it was
[1:53:22] just an inspiration that came on her she
[1:53:24] knew she had a problem she had a health
[1:53:28] problem amen she had a health problem
[1:53:33] and she did struck me in a crowd and
[1:53:36] this thing just she said if I can just
[1:53:39] touch this man that can give the blind
[1:53:43] his side this man I can be able to raise
[1:53:47] the dead and make the creeper to walk if
[1:53:49] I can just only touch the hem of his
[1:53:53] coming I know my blood issue will be
[1:53:57] what is that it's inspiration praise the
[1:54:04] Lord
[1:54:05] just having an inspiration on your heart
[1:54:08] and so what if I can just you know if I
[1:54:12] can just give this man they say and the
[1:54:15] thing about it be rich the other it's
[1:54:19] been able to
[1:54:20] you puttin yourself in the channel for
[1:54:25] God to use you praise the Lord
[1:54:33] knowing that is the father that is
[1:54:35] calling in and it ended the truth about
[1:54:37] it there is that God called every one of
[1:54:39] us in different ways it was a different
[1:54:43] services that the Lord got ahold of us
[1:54:48] different messages were preached
[1:54:51] different start of preaching but one
[1:55:00] purpose is that he got us price alone
[1:55:10] it's a person funny and inspiration
[1:55:14] glory be to God but Rama says there's no
[1:55:21] holy man among us it's the Holy Ghost
[1:55:24] among his people I mean you see so when
[1:55:32] the word required us to live just as he
[1:55:36] required us to label every cent if our
[1:55:38] life live a clean life is not just a
[1:55:42] church requirement Amen if the world
[1:55:47] requires us to dress a certain way and
[1:55:50] and require us you know to attain from
[1:55:54] setting things you know you know don't
[1:55:58] God is requiring us there because he
[1:56:06] want to keep us in his presence and for
[1:56:10] us to carry that presence to the word if
[1:56:14] we were just want to realize that like
[1:56:21] Paul says I'm the Temple of the Holy
[1:56:23] Ghost that we add a tabernacle of God
[1:56:26] and as you go to work you are carrying
[1:56:30] God with you
[1:56:34] praise the Lord
[1:56:42] this efficient church believed that that
[1:56:47] just how solid these people were that
[1:56:50] was how that was how much they
[1:56:52] understood to know that Paul I mean John
[1:57:00] spoke about the coming Messiah even
[1:57:03] though they never saw him in flesh but
[1:57:06] God was able to keep them for them to be
[1:57:09] able to see him in the world even Paul
[1:57:15] never saw our Lord Jesus in the flesh
[1:57:18] now that he was born after Jesus died no
[1:57:25] but he was after the traditions of his
[1:57:28] father he never saw Jesus in the flesh
[1:57:30] but he saw Jesus in a word praise the
[1:57:38] Lord you know I was driving to church
[1:57:41] this evening I was thinking on this I
[1:57:43] was thinking on this it was running
[1:57:45] through my mind it statue of a perfect
[1:57:48] man that's what I was thinking about and
[1:57:51] then I started to think who was this
[1:57:54] perfect man
[1:57:55] that brother Brennan was talking about I
[1:57:59] mean he said his message was that statue
[1:58:04] of a perfect man and statues I always
[1:58:11] may after someone it's an image of
[1:58:15] someone amen praise the Lord and as I
[1:58:21] was robbing I was just thinking this in
[1:58:22] my mind and says well I would love to
[1:58:24] see George Washington statue or Abraham
[1:58:27] Lincoln statue or the statute of
[1:58:31] different men that were made I was just
[1:58:32] driving it coming to church this evening
[1:58:34] I was thinking about that and it was
[1:58:37] just becoming so real to me then I
[1:58:39] started asking myself who was this
[1:58:41] perfect man there brother Branham was
[1:58:44] talking about amen and I see preaching
[1:58:50] the message you were real I better bad I
[1:58:51] was talking also about a living monument
[1:58:54] that did
[1:58:56] statue of a peasant man was not a
[1:58:59] destiny it was not a mortal statue but
[1:59:03] it was a living monument praise the Lord
[1:59:09] oh I could not fail to all too - I mean
[1:59:14] I was just I was just I was just having
[1:59:16] church by myself I mean I was just
[1:59:19] thinking in maimana says oh my goodness
[1:59:21] God made man in His image I mean when
[1:59:27] God made Adam and every statue is put in
[1:59:30] the garden praise the Lord
[1:59:34] the beauty of the garden is the statue
[1:59:38] the reason why the garden is beautified
[1:59:42] and different trees are planted and the
[1:59:44] poor benches is because of that statue
[1:59:46] that they pulled right there and here is
[1:59:49] God make a garden and he's going to put
[1:59:52] his own statue he made man in His image
[1:59:59] praise the Lord
[2:00:01] amen he's going to put his own statue
[2:00:05] right in the garden and the statute that
[2:00:08] he put in the garden was also a living
[2:00:11] monument it was a statue that could move
[2:00:18] aside to you that the animals cool
[2:00:21] acetal amen
[2:00:25] a living monument please right there in
[2:00:28] the Garden of Eden and I was just
[2:00:30] thinking in my mind I says oh my
[2:00:32] goodness how sometimes we just kind of
[2:00:35] amidst this thing how we have run into
[2:00:37] Tunde doctrines and virtue doctrines and
[2:00:39] different doctrines when the simple
[2:00:44] messy brother Brandon preached was the
[2:00:46] statue of a perfect name amen
[2:00:53] and Paul says that we are confined to
[2:00:56] the image of Christ once again God is
[2:01:01] going to have a living monument on the
[2:01:04] earth and people that can represent him
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:09] I mean and people that can represent him
[2:01:17] has to go to school as they go to work
[2:01:20] as a going into the morning and and and
[2:01:23] they lay them on the world but yet they

[2:05:41] give to a frame when it come upon you
[2:05:47] give it
[2:05:53] [Music]
[2:05:55] but you see the devil comes down the
[2:05:57] round
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:06:01] he condemns our mind
[2:06:06] when the early church was in this habit
[2:06:09] just like where Balaam said if I pray
[2:06:14] for hundred souls tonight and it dad I
[2:06:17] would stay keep reading
[2:06:20] amen when when the early church was in
[2:06:23] this habit where they believed their
[2:06:25] aprons taking off of their body their
[2:06:28] clothes and the Athenians that they have
[2:06:31] it's able to carry presence in home of
[2:06:34] sinners carry presence in the home of
[2:06:37] the hospital's and presence in a home
[2:06:40] the gifts that we gave in different
[2:06:42] things that we give to people on the
[2:06:44] street when you see a beggar on the
[2:06:47] street sometimes it's so easy to it runs
[2:06:50] through our mind all that he's on drugs
[2:06:51] if I give you something now he would go
[2:06:54] and do drugs that's that's not your your
[2:06:56] your inner heart your inner heart must
[2:06:59] go out and cry for that soul that man is
[2:07:02] impressive
[2:07:04] he's embracing his culture in something
[2:07:06] that is greater than he
[2:07:21] sometimes the enemy will come in and try
[2:07:25] to condemn us try to
[2:07:31] remind us and when he do all of those
[2:07:35] things just a week in our failure but
[2:07:38] don't listening to the devil by child of
[2:07:44] God my son of God my daughter of God
[2:07:48] and you know you Karen you tabernacling
[2:07:52] God in this body

[2:08:14] of his son in his daughter that is
[2:08:17] possessed by his spirit

[2:10:01] talking about hygiene
[2:10:03] he says if it was in the days of our
[2:10:06] Lord Jesus they would have arrested him
[2:10:09] and said they were it's not hygienic for
[2:10:11] him to spit on the ground and take care
[2:10:13] miss his spit with clay and rub it on a
[2:10:16] man's eye he says to talk about hot jam
[2:10:19] but yet they would go down to the pool
[2:10:22] and they were all dashed into the same
[2:10:24] water then they would drink those waters
[2:10:26] with people that have just come living
[2:10:29] in nasty life and it were all swimming
[2:10:31] the same pool and all of that he says
[2:10:34] and they call that fun he says and then
[2:10:38] when we comes to the to the to the table
[2:10:40] of the Lord and we take that cup and
[2:10:43] drink and pass it one on to another they
[2:10:46] said that's not hygiene
[2:10:50] that's the reason why we pray for one
[2:10:53] another when we come to the communion
[2:10:56] that's the reason why we partake with
[2:10:59] one another when we come to the
[2:11:00] convenient
[2:11:04] because we are called to impart brother
[2:11:08] Branham says intend alive is living for
[2:11:10] others
