[0:00] [Music]
[0:34] in your bibles i want you to turn to the
[0:36] book of jonah
[0:37] it's uh we always talk so much about
[0:40] jonah being a backslidden and everything
[0:42] i've always tuck up for john
[0:44] i do not believe that jonah was backslid
[0:48] i i do not believe that i believe it's
[0:51] just we just sometimes use it say he's a
[0:54] jonah but
[0:56] if we i've already spoke on it in
[0:58] another way and telling how that i
[1:00] thought jonah what took place
[1:04] now the word of the lord came
[1:06] to
[1:07] jonah
[1:09] the son of amira saying arise and go to
[1:12] nineveh that great city cry out against
[1:16] it
[1:17] for their wickedness has come up before
[1:19] me but jonah rose up to flee unto
[1:22] tarshish
[1:24] from the presence of the lord
[1:26] and went down to joppa and he found a
[1:28] ship going to tarshish so he paid the
[1:31] fare thereof and went down into it to go
[1:36] with them unto tarshish
[1:39] from the presence of the lord
[1:43] isn't that a sad ending
[1:45] a man running from the presence of the
[1:48] lord
[1:49] and that's my subject
[1:51] now first we want to think of this
[1:55] jonah was the reason
[1:57] the principal reason i believe that he
[2:00] did this great thing here was because
[2:03] jonah was a jew
[2:06] and he was asked to go to a gentile city
[2:08] to cry out against him
[2:10] thinking that he would not be received
[2:13] because the gentiles would think what's
[2:16] this jew got to do with us
[2:18] but you see another thing it gives us a
[2:20] great thing here to see that god not
[2:23] only is god of the jew but he's god also
[2:26] of the gentile he's god of all people he
[2:30] just chose
[2:31] the jews
[2:33] the jews was called god's chosen people
[2:37] they were chosen for a pacific
[2:40] cause and that cause was to give to them
[2:44] the law
[2:45] and they could not keep it and he just
[2:48] showed by that people that the law could
[2:50] not be kept and if he was a
[2:54] god of righteousness and the law
[2:56] demanded righteousness but there was no
[2:59] grace in law to bring a man out no
[3:02] penalty was paid by the law but it taken
[3:05] grace to pay that penalty or where the
[3:08] law put us under it and jonah here was
[3:12] called on as this one of the minor
[3:14] prophets of the bible to go down to this
[3:18] city
[3:18] and here we find an example of all of us
[3:22] every one of us we always are running
[3:25] from something
[3:27] we run from trouble we run from
[3:29] responsibilities
[3:31] we we're all prone to do that
[3:34] we will we're more prone to running we
[3:36] are to stand and face it out see we just
[3:40] we we find ourselves running sometimes
[3:42] we find ourselves prone to run from work
[3:44] we don't want to we don't want to work
[3:47] some people just think they can make
[3:48] their living without working
[3:50] but i think solomon it was and said we
[3:52] could find uh hear the answer and
[3:55] watching an ant you know a little ant
[3:57] they tell me if that every ant doesn't
[4:00] work and lay in that ant doesn't eat
[4:02] that winter either so everybody has to
[4:05] to work we got so many things we have to
[4:08] do so much responsibility that we have
[4:11] to face
[4:12] everybody's got to face a certain
[4:14] responsibility
[4:16] when you when you come to to choose your
[4:19] wife to get married
[4:21] or choose your husband you you've got to
[4:24] take a responsibility
[4:26] and then you must remember maybe you
[4:28] build a home it's a nice pretty home
[4:31] and then remember as a married woman
[4:34] you've got to think of the
[4:35] responsibility of raising children
[4:38] you got to think of that pretty slick
[4:40] walls are going to have little dirty
[4:42] hand prints all over them then you got
[4:44] the responsibility of educating your
[4:46] children you got the responsibility
[4:48] clothing and feeding everything is a
[4:50] responsibility and it's so easy when
[4:52] responsibilities faces to shirt from
[4:55] them
[4:56] and we find out that marriage is a
[4:59] responsibility in all matters even many
[5:02] times we find this is hard to say but
[5:04] it's true
[5:05] that ministers
[5:07] many times shirt of responsibility or
[5:11] standing for the true word of god when
[5:14] they're confronted with it
[5:16] they'll shirk that responsibility
[5:20] when truth of the word of god is brought
[5:23] face to face with we human beings we
[5:25] have we're prone
[5:27] to
[5:28] shirt back until the last resource
[5:32] i just got through talking to my little
[5:33] nephew up there
[5:35] he's a catholic and he uh not baptize
[5:38] that boy in the name of jesus christ
[5:40] here a few years ago and he got with
[5:42] some little girl and turned catholic and
[5:44] i held his mother's hand while she was
[5:45] dying over there she said to me the last
[5:47] words take care of melvin and he's just
[5:50] been dreaming dreams he just can't every
[5:52] every day the last week he's been
[5:53] dreaming dreams said i walk into your
[5:55] church uncle bill you're standing there
[5:57] preaching i'd run up to start to make
[5:58] your confession i'd wake up
[6:00] he said
[6:01] i've been wrong i said melvin you don't
[6:03] need no interpretation for that
[6:05] your place is down there where you
[6:07] belong that's right i think but the face
[6:11] up to responsibilities
[6:13] sometimes it takes the very height off
[6:15] of us to do that as a father to face up
[6:18] the responsibility to give your child a
[6:20] whipping them little fellas you don't
[6:22] want to do that but as a father a mother
[6:25] you got to face the responsibility of
[6:27] raising that child because the bible
[6:28] said spare the rod you spoil your son
[6:31] and that still stands good in the side
[6:34] of every psychologist there is in a
[6:36] world that still remains god's truth
[6:39] if there had been more of that practice
[6:40] and we wouldn't have so much juvenile
[6:42] delinquency and stuff in a rot we got in
[6:44] the world today
[6:45] but the old golden rule of the homes
[6:47] been broken long time ago and let the
[6:49] kids do whatever they want to but even
[6:51] as i said ministers
[6:54] they'll come face to face with truth and
[6:56] then walk away from it see they're
[6:58] they're just ha it seems like there's
[7:00] something that they they don't want to
[7:02] face up to it
[7:04] many times i've had people come say i
[7:06] know that's right brother branham but if
[7:08] i did that they kicked me out of the
[7:09] church whatever
[7:12] if you don't you're going to kick you
[7:13] out up there so you got to be kicked out
[7:15] somewhere
[7:16] see so you might as well face up to it
[7:19] instead of running from it say well i'll
[7:21] go over here i won't go back go back
[7:23] sure listen to some more of it search
[7:25] the scriptures jesus said search the
[7:28] scriptures for in them you think you
[7:29] have eternal life and they are they that
[7:31] testify of me
[7:33] but we find that people won't face up
[7:36] with that being brought to uh into the
[7:39] presence of god and see
[7:41] when god made a promise and god has
[7:44] obligated that promise and when he
[7:46] brings that promise to pass
[7:48] then people are afraid to face up to the
[7:52] responsibility of coping with the
[7:54] message of the hour
[7:56] we find that everywhere how about you
[7:58] lutherans how many lutherans was a
[8:00] prayed uh uh people afraid to face up to
[8:03] luther's truth when he come forth with
[8:05] justification
[8:06] look what it cost you maybe your own
[8:09] life to come out and confess jesus
[8:11] christ and and become a lutheran look at
[8:14] you methodists how it used to be you all
[8:17] were called holy rollers i guess you
[8:19] know that and they get another spirit
[8:20] and jerk back and forth and they said
[8:22] they they had the jerks the meth that no
[8:24] that ain't pentecostal that was
[8:25] methodist
[8:26] long years ago and they jerked and shook
[8:30] and fell under the power of god and it
[8:31] throwed water in their faces and fanned
[8:33] him with fans thought they passed out
[8:36] and now you were considered a bunch of
[8:38] holy rollers but you had your mothers
[8:40] and fathers had to either accept it face
[8:43] up to the truth and facts or turn it
[8:45] around
[8:46] what about you pentecostals that receive
[8:48] the restoration of the gifts when the
[8:50] baptism the holy ghost come out with
[8:52] speaking in tongues and the gifts of the
[8:54] spirit coming back in the church well
[8:56] the methodists wanted to kick you out
[8:58] and they did do it but you had to face
[9:00] up to it it's something you had to do
[9:03] what about the issue when it come out
[9:05] about the baptism in the name of jesus
[9:06] christ and you saw it was the truth you
[9:09] have to face up to it or do something
[9:11] about it you've got a responsibility
[9:14] everybody has and you must face up to
[9:17] these things all right
[9:19] and when you see that in this day now
[9:21] when the word of god has made these
[9:23] promises of things that we see happening
[9:25] now then we've got the responsibility to
[9:28] either face up to it or get away from it
[9:31] you have you just can't stay neutral
[9:33] you've got to do something about it
[9:36] since some moves got to be made you
[9:38] can't come in that church door and go
[9:40] out the same person you come in you're
[9:42] either further away or closer to god
[9:45] every time you come in or go out there
[9:48] oh how easy it is for people to shirt
[9:51] these things and i want us to think of
[9:53] these when we start into the official uh
[9:56] services tomorrow night that i want you
[9:59] to notice when something is confronted
[10:01] if you if there's a question about it if
[10:04] there's a question about it there's got
[10:06] to be an answer
[10:07] say for instance i said i was going west
[10:10] and you pointed me this way well the
[10:12] first thing you know i'll run plumber
[10:14] past my target and i'm too i'm northwest
[10:16] well why somebody points me down this
[10:18] way to go that way i'll pass my target
[10:20] again and went southwest well as long as
[10:22] there's a question which way is west
[10:24] there's got to be a direct answer
[10:26] somewhere and when these questions
[10:28] confront us about the bible truths
[10:30] there's got to be the right answer
[10:32] somewhere
[10:34] right there's got to be there and when
[10:36] we see something presented i think
[10:38] instead of just run away it's all
[10:40] nonsense i couldn't believe a thing like
[10:41] that i couldn't believe that why don't
[10:43] you take the bible and sit down and face
[10:46] up to it
[10:47] study it you're hearing the meaning now
[10:49] just look it over check it out yourself
[10:52] with the word check the word by the word
[10:55] that's the only way to make it tell the
[10:56] truth and it must tell the truth from
[10:58] genesis or revelation
[11:01] christ is a revelation of the whole
[11:03] bible in him christ all the full and
[11:06] fulfilling of all the prophecies of the
[11:08] bible is met unconditionally in christ
[11:11] jesus because he was god manifested in
[11:14] the flesh
[11:15] now when we find these things oh when
[11:17] we're confronted and come into a meeting
[11:20] and see the power of god moving and
[11:22] doing things and doing supernatural
[11:24] works and sit uh perform and look in the
[11:26] bible and see that it's promised for
[11:29] this hour
[11:30] then when we see those things then we
[11:32] are confronted with a responsibility to
[11:35] either accept it i mean as for ourselves
[11:38] now many people sympathize many people
[11:41] say it's right
[11:42] but that don't that don't make it what
[11:44] that ain't the thing that you're
[11:46] responsible for
[11:48] is i've said what if i was a young man
[11:50] and looking for a wife to be married and
[11:52] you're stood a girl that met every
[11:54] qualification that i thought it took to
[11:56] make a woman
[11:57] why morally she was a queen and lovely
[12:00] and a fine personality a real christian
[12:04] everything that i could think of to make
[12:06] me a good wife no matter how much i say
[12:08] she's perfect she's exactly right
[12:10] she isn't mine until i accept her and
[12:14] the responsibility of her being my wife
[12:17] that's the same thing the message is you
[12:19] might say it's right or this that word
[12:21] say i sympathize with it i believe it's
[12:23] the truth but you've got to accept it
[12:25] and it's got to become a part of you and
[12:27] you're a part of it
[12:28] you've got then it's yours
[12:32] when you marry this certain woman that
[12:33] you have chosen you are you are one man
[12:36] and that's where you are with christ
[12:38] when you see him manifested and made
[12:41] real then you are part of him and he's
[12:43] part of you
[12:45] and together you're part of the message
[12:48] oh how many denominational ships that we
[12:51] got going down to tarshish for the jonas
[12:53] of these days
[12:55] 900 of them something
[12:57] a ships that takes the easy route
[13:01] don't want to face up to jonah didn't
[13:02] want to face up the thing of going to
[13:04] the gentiles he didn't want to take that
[13:06] cruel message over there within 40 days
[13:09] you'll perish if you don't repent
[13:12] he hated to do that he thought that
[13:14] gentiles was hard tell what they'll do
[13:15] to me but he had to face up to it
[13:18] but he took a easy ship and went down
[13:21] the tarshit went down in the hall of the
[13:24] ship and went to sleep took the easy
[13:27] route
[13:28] the easy way it's a popular way with the
[13:31] people it's easy to take the way where
[13:33] everybody can patch you on the back and
[13:35] say you're a good fella and this is
[13:37] so-and-so and certain and the world look
[13:39] upon you it's easy to go the proper way
[13:42] but when
[13:43] when you have to do something different
[13:46] when you have to stand to your
[13:48] conviction and what you know to be the
[13:50] truth there's where the hard part that's
[13:52] the rub comes right there
[13:55] oh as we've often sang that old song how
[13:57] easy while sailing the sea in his calm
[13:59] to trust in the strength of jehovah's
[14:01] great arm
[14:02] but oh let the waves begin to blow
[14:05] let the wind blow and whip up the waves
[14:08] then what do you do
[14:09] something like i was told one time the
[14:11] lady said back in the horse and buggy
[14:13] days that
[14:14] said the horse ran away with her going
[14:15] from church said what did you do said i
[14:17] trusted the lord until the lines broke
[14:20] well that's the time to trust the lord
[14:22] after ever after the lines is broke
[14:25] you're trusting in the lines until
[14:26] they're broke
[14:28] yes and um so we find out that we have
[14:31] many easy ways to go ships going down
[14:35] the tarshire parts easy the
[14:37] unresponsibilities
[14:39] it just flows in you have everything
[14:41] coming everybody's likes you and
[14:43] everybody or nobody disagree with you
[14:46] you disagree with nobody now that ain't
[14:48] a dishrag
[14:51] that's right
[14:52] yes
[14:53] push over flop over why
[14:56] anybody i don't care who you are and
[14:59] what you're standing for actually decent
[15:02] thinking people think more of you if
[15:04] you'll stand for your conviction of
[15:05] what's right right
[15:07] don't care you take a woman she might be
[15:09] ever not very attractive in whatever she
[15:12] is but you let that woman stand for
[15:14] principles of womanhood let her stand
[15:17] like a lady and if a man's got an ounce
[15:19] a man about him he'll take up for
[15:21] absolutely we appreciate something that
[15:24] somebody's got that they believe that
[15:26] it's the truth and it'll stand for what
[15:27] they think it's right
[15:29] how wishy washy that's what's too many
[15:32] christians that they are so soft-soaked
[15:34] and everything until they think all they
[15:36] do is join a church go in somewhere put
[15:38] their name on a book or do a little
[15:40] something jump up and down shouter or
[15:42] something like that and call it
[15:43] christianity christianity is a everyday
[15:46] rugged life living for god in this
[15:49] presence world
[15:50] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[15:52] love of god in the heart that sets you
[15:55] apart and puts you out younger with the
[15:57] people and making converts to christ
[16:00] responsibilities but it's easy to go the
[16:02] way the world goes it's easy to flow
[16:04] down the stream go out there and sit
[16:06] down in the river with your boat you get
[16:08] your oars to start pulling up against
[16:09] the current you don't make much time and
[16:11] it goes hard but you just once let loose
[16:14] the oars and watch how fast you pass the
[16:16] trees going down but look where you're
[16:18] going
[16:20] when things are floating easy remember
[16:22] you're going towards a a great cataract
[16:24] down there of some sort you're going
[16:26] towards the falls
[16:27] it won't be long you'll be going over
[16:29] that falls just floating with the world
[16:32] easy the way it goes you don't want that
[16:34] no sir but you must accept your
[16:37] responsibility
[16:38] now you believe it and you you think
[16:40] it's the truth and the responsibility
[16:43] that god has given us in this day to
[16:45] bring this message
[16:47] and as i get older and i know my days
[16:50] are sharpening up i feel a
[16:52] responsibility greater than i ever felt
[16:55] press it on
[16:58] we must do it we must get down to it in
[17:02] a everywhere we go and tell the message
[17:05] and and tell the people that jesus
[17:07] christ is coming that he's god and he's
[17:09] coming soon there's not a not a hope
[17:12] left in the world but the coming of the
[17:14] lord
[17:15] looking back there are some friends
[17:17] that's with me up there when the angel
[17:18] lord these boys sitting here i believe
[17:20] they found the place where it happened
[17:22] up there and just remember what the lord
[17:24] said that day to brother woods was
[17:26] walking up the hill and and he was kind
[17:29] of weeping because of his wife being
[17:31] sick and the lord said pick up that rock
[17:33] and throw it up in the air and say thus
[17:34] saith the lord
[17:36] and i did that brother woods the setting
[17:38] is a witness and i said brother woods it
[17:39] won't be long you're going to see
[17:41] something happen and the next day when
[17:43] we were standing there all of us
[17:45] together and a bunch of the man standing
[17:47] right here tonight
[17:48] a young preacher was there and he was uh
[17:51] i noticed i just met him the night
[17:53] before he was in our camp he came up to
[17:54] be with us
[17:56] and he said to me he said brother
[17:57] branham do you ever see visions out like
[17:59] this i said yes sir but i'll come out
[18:01] here to get away from it to kind of rest
[18:03] a little bit he said well i said uh uh
[18:07] of course he
[18:08] shows me things out here and i said just
[18:10] over the hill here where the seven
[18:11] angels appeared down in there he said
[18:14] yeah i understand said i was one of the
[18:15] sponsors on your meeting
[18:17] over in california i said well i'm
[18:18] certainly glad to know that and while i
[18:20] was standing there just then i looked
[18:22] around i seen a kind of a heavyset
[18:24] doctor looking into his eyes and i heard
[18:26] him say you're going to lose that eye
[18:28] because his allergy in there and i've
[18:30] doctored but two years and you're going
[18:31] to lose that eye i said reason you asked
[18:33] me that because your doctor told you the
[18:35] day's going to lose that eye
[18:37] and he said that's right
[18:39] and he looked around like that i seen
[18:41] his mother take off one of her stockings
[18:43] and hold her foot out with little tumors
[18:45] hanging down between her toes up and
[18:47] down her leg and said if you see brother
[18:49] ram tell him to pray for this
[18:52] i said your mother had her stuck her
[18:54] foot out like that and said she had he's

[20:52] got to be a true answer somewhere
[20:54] there's got to be a truth there's one
[20:56] east and one west but there's a one
[20:58] southeast northwest or something but
[21:00] there's got to be a true answer
[21:02] somewhere to the problem
[21:05] shirk this we must tell the people that
[21:07] we're living in the hours of the coming
[21:09] of the son of god we won't want to watch
[21:12] and god be
[21:13] on the move all the time ready to give a
[21:16] man a correct answer
[21:18] it's always been that way it's been a
[21:20] man as shirked and went away from god
[21:23] ever since adam in the garden of eden
[21:25] when adam was in the garden of eden when
[21:27] he come to the responsibility to make
[21:29] his choice would he stay with god or go
[21:32] with his wife
[21:33] he had to make that res he had to make
[21:35] that
[21:36] the responsibility was up to him he
[21:37] either had to take what his wife said or
[21:40] what god said and when he chose to go
[21:42] the way of his wife
[21:44] and when he did that then he lost his
[21:47] original condition and brought the whole
[21:50] world subject to death when he had to
[21:52] take the responsibility of accepting a
[21:55] new life that his wife had found which
[21:57] was contrary
[22:00] oh god think of it
[22:02] god only give him about eight or ten
[22:04] words to keep
[22:07] but that tree thou shall not eat
[22:10] that's all he had to keep and even just
[22:12] that much word they broke it
[22:15] then adam had to face up with uh well i
[22:17] do as my wife has said to or shall i do
[22:20] what god said to then he walked out with
[22:22] his eyes open
[22:25] he had to take the responsibility
[22:27] through the whole human race unto death
[22:30] then there come that other adam which
[22:31] was christ
[22:33] everyone like him
[22:36] somebody said he wasn't god
[22:38] his uniqueness proved he was god
[22:41] i never was a creature lived like him he
[22:43] lived in a world to himself he was born
[22:46] outside of the rim of the natural
[22:49] hallelujah he was a creator in south
[22:51] late
[22:54] who could ever stand where he stood who
[22:56] ever talked like him who could ever say
[22:58] the things that he said who could ever
[23:00] do the things that he'd done
[23:02] his uniqueness proved he was god there
[23:04] wasn't a prophet or nothing else could
[23:06] do what he did
[23:07] who could call the dead back from the
[23:09] grave and who could stop the skies and
[23:12] do anything he wanted to do he was god
[23:15] who could ever stand in this place who
[23:17] what could he be with that perfect
[23:20] immortal god amen made flesh into
[23:23] ottomans
[23:25] nothing ever compared with him he lived
[23:27] in a world to himself
[23:29] no man ever spake like him when he just
[23:31] opened his mouth there was something
[23:33] about it
[23:34] that was different from anybody else
[23:37] somebody said he was just an ordinary
[23:39] man i'd defy that
[23:42] he was god
[23:43] that's what he was
[23:44] or no man ever spoke like him old man
[23:46] couldn't speak like he because he was a
[23:49] living word itself made pressure
[23:52] a manifestation of the fullness of god i
[23:55] will admit that prophets had their
[23:56] message they had and then they had them
[23:58] now but that was the fullness of their
[24:00] godhead bodily manifested there
[24:05] he was the unique one and he was the one
[24:07] that had to face the issue with all of
[24:10] his great powers that he had that he
[24:12] could have absolutely been the king of
[24:14] the world
[24:16] he will be he through his saints he is
[24:18] now american
[24:20] he stood there what man would be poor
[24:22] didn't have a place to lay his head that
[24:24] even lord where a fish wanted a coin
[24:28] ooh what man could take them big jugs of
[24:30] water and turn them into wine and not
[24:32] have a place to lay his head he had to
[24:34] face up to the
[24:36] responsibilities that have been given
[24:37] into his hands what man that could raise
[24:39] a man out of that grave age had been
[24:41] dead four days and rotten
[24:44] could he neither save himself sure he
[24:46] could but if he did he'd not saved us
[24:49] he had the face up to the
[24:50] responsibilities and because of his
[24:52] obedience to the word were adam's
[24:55] disobedience and he took the shortcut
[24:57] the the way down to tarshish but jesus
[25:00] tucked away in the end of the to the
[25:02] gentiles to get himself a bride i'm glad
[25:05] that he did it tonight
[25:09] we are to face up to the facts that we
[25:11] belong to him
[25:13] take the world away amen
[25:16] every man had to face after that's got a
[25:18] responsibility before god
[25:20] we just say for instance noah he had
[25:22] noah moses elijah and all the rest of of
[25:26] every age
[25:28] had to face up to the responsibility and
[25:31] they had to do it but that's reason they
[25:33] were sent in the hours look at noah and
[25:35] his scientific age how he had to face up
[25:38] to a thing that was so unscientific well
[25:40] there was no
[25:42] a reason why it couldn't be unscientific
[25:45] it was unscientific rather why they said
[25:48] school rain out of the skies they never
[25:49] had rain to drop out of the heavens
[25:52] now he had to face up to it god said it
[25:54] was going to rain
[25:55] and then he then faith without works is
[25:57] dead
[25:59] if you say i believe it don't make no
[26:00] act
[26:01] just like the message if you say i
[26:03] believe it don't make an act what good
[26:05] does it do
[26:06] noah went to work with his hammer and
[26:08] built an ark to confirm what he was
[26:11] talking about that's what we have to do
[26:13] too
[26:13] we have to go to work and prove our
[26:15] faith by our works our works proves our
[26:17] faith moses had to do it elijah
[26:22] [Music]
[27:14] you
