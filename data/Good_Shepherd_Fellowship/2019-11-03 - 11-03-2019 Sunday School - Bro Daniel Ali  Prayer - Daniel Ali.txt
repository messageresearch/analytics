========================================

very much for having kept us by a mighty right hand and for having provided as a safe haven because we know as the scripture says that a named Jesus is a mighty tower the righteous run it into root and is safe we know that our lives are safe and secure in you dear Lord Jesus and we fear no fool I don't care what the enemy does because we know that our lives are in your hands whatever it pleases you to do with them further oh God that is what you are going to do we are so grateful for having been with us not for having seen as true in difficult times you have never left us on our own you have been with us for a truth we can thin and we are so grateful Lord that our life's high in your hands we give you the glory this morning we praise thee further we wash when we bless thee our Lord and our Savior Jesus we have got it once again to talk about our prayer topic we thank you Lord for the tool you have given us for that weapon for this weapon of prayer you have given us for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal by the arm idea to the pulling down of strongholds father open our eyes to see what we have and to reckon in the weapons of our warfare now we can break when the need arises we can destroy with it when the need arises we can make amends with it when the need arises now we can use this weapon of warfare in every single field Lord I shall not be let down we are just so thankful we are asking for your grace your love and your mercy slow to abide with us and we pray committing as many as only away come in father they will bring them in safely also now you would unite our hearts together this morning Lord that we will lift our voices on today in Jesus name Amen praise God yeah I wasn't very sure if we're going to have a pre-meeting we're going to look at prayer this morning but hang God we are here this morning yes so [Music] yes start talking about prayer I want us to look at Matthew 26:41 mari 26:41 okay watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak Jesus speaking you know if we would humble ourselves and pray there are a lot of things we would not go into if we would humble ourselves and pray watch out and pray there are a lot of circumstances that would not even come our way to begin with but when we do not pray or when we do not give ourselves to prayer we open the door so wide for the devil to walk in and out of our lives it's like you have no privacy it's like you're living in a room and the door is open a jar anybody walks in when they want and they walk out when they want and that is what the devil does in a prayer less life because there are no guards prayer would keep the enemy at bay it keeps the devil in check but where there is no prayer that ever tells you like a football this is you when you go there when it's ready it comes for you and he's in the other place but when you give yourself to prayer you limit what the devil can do you keep the devil in check they come back on you they can't take you for granted why because you have given yourself to prayer watch out and pray that he entered not into temptation and now and it's not as if when you are pray or enter into temptation the temptations would come my brother Branham said to be tempted is no evil Jesus after he fasted and prayed for forty days he was tempted so to be tempted is loss in it's when you yield to the temptation there you have given birth to sin praise be to God so when the devil throws anything at you is like you were wearing a bulletproof vest and then they fire at you with a rubber bullet in the first place a rubber bullet would not kill but you've been in a blood proof vest and be fire outwitted by a rubber bullet you would even feel it it would even though it wouldn't do anything to your life you will see when the devil is coming in but he's going to flee in seven ways praise be to God so to be tempted is no evil but it's when you hear to it then there is a problem now a lot of the times people fall and they say that ever made me to do it the devil didn't make you do anything let's read James 1:13 2:15 James 1:13 to 15 let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so the part that I'm interested in this morning is but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed so when you are drawn away of your own lust and you get enticed and you yield to it their sin has been given back to the devil can never compel you to sin he will tempt you all right that devil is behind every single temptation God does not tempt what God does to us he will try you because the Bible makes us to understand the trail of our faith is more precious than both to him but God would not tempt his children so just know that you have enough power you have been given enough power to stop the devil in its tracks and when you go out of your way to do anything on godly it is you doing it just tell me those that go to the nightclubs that he just got to the point and you said no I am NOT going to go there anymore and then you entered your room and you lay on your bed and you lock the door and then you open your sight you open your eyes all of a sudden to realize that you are inside there it doesn't happen you would have to get up put on your shirt put on your shoes open the door drive good pay money and enter the devil doesn't carry you bind you in Chains and carry you know in the book of Genesis the Bible says we are free moral agents in other ways you can choose to serve God or not God does not compel you God would not force you that is why in the book of Revelation the Bible says he stands at the door and he keeps knocking pleading that you open the door and let him in he doesn't force you he doesn't force himself on any man praise be to God and it is not just only to the kingdom of God it is also to tell you that the devil cannot compel you to do something that is against the will of God it has to be by a personal choice the choices you make would lead you into those days and now so as we said the double the only thing the devil fears is prayer the devil doesn't feel your muscles but if he s prayer because he knows what prayer can do and because the devil knows what prayer can do the devil would try to stop you from praying by any means possible the devil will try to stop you from praying and where the devil cannot stop you from praying and then you get on your knees to pray or you go ahead to pray anyhow he doesn't stop there he comes again and tells you that your prayer will not be answered what is he trying to do to get you to lose confidence in the Word of God and in the promises of God and if the devil can get you to disbelieve or to believe that your prayer will not be answered that it was buried it even prayer to begin with if you pray and the devil can better to believe that your prayer will not be answered it is as good as not praying so if the devil is not able to stop you and you go ahead and you pray and the devil is telling your prayer will not be answered and he gives you 1000 reasons why a prayer will not be answered and you are still holding on to the promises of God and you are believing and trusting that God will answer the prayer he doesn't stop there when God finally answers the prayer he comes again oh it was by chance it was meant to be it wasn't God answering your prayer that is for the devil does so if it was meant to be if it was by chance if it is no good as in the prayer why did we have to professed before we see the results tens that happen by chance you don't pray wait on the Lord and then you see them happen when we'll pray and we hold on we wait on God and God answers that prayer and we see the manifestation of the result is God on the move it is not by chance it was not meant to be and why would the devil do that so you don't come back to God to give God his glory God lost it when he unless your prayer and you can't come back to him to give him the glory to give him the praise to tell him thank you God honors that praise be to God where there not ten lepers that were healed how many of them came back to the Lord Jesus one only one came out of the ten he came back search for him and when he got there he threw himself by his feet and he praised the Lord he blessed him and Jesus talked a lot about that lepida was healed praise be to God you can go back to read every scene look 17 14 to 19 it's a good thing to show gratitude because in first Timothy 6:6 the Bible says that God lead us with contentment is a great game it doesn't matter how small it is show gratitude if you can have time to fast and pray I'll pray I don't care for how long and God answers your prayer you should have time to come back to God and tell him thank you what that does is that it opens the door of your blessings wider I remember in 1991 later 1990 or 1991 or 92 Dara boss I had a friend who had a pen a pen for a pen pal and a purpose sent her fifty US dollars so she went for the money and then she came back and said oh my pen friend sent me fifty dollars I said that is good is that what is good about it only fifty dollars then I asked her you mean only fifty somebody you don't know I said I call him and I told him now oh you sent me only fifty dollars then I told her I said that was very ungrateful I said this is the last time you are going to hear from him and it happened that that was the last time she ever heard from him you don't even know this person maybe he's trying to find out with this manicure to this person so let me try with something small and if that goes through oh I cannot trust the channel to send more a lot of the times that is what God does sometimes you would overlook the blessing oh this small team miss Martin it is not how small it is we're grateful when God does something for you show gratitude go to God thank him let God know that you appreciate what he has done what that does is that it opens the door wider for God to give you a lot more blessing even our own children if you have two children and then you give this may be a saint this one I sent and oh and then one is happy Oh daddy thank you God bless you and the other one France only one sent trust me the above your children but your heart before you away your heart is tilting towards that one who shows more gratitude praise be to God so the devil wanting to close in on your blesses would give you a lot of reasons to think now oh this did not happen oh it was meant to happen it was in God just to make sure that you don't go and give God what belongs to him and by so doing you have hindered yourself in a lot of ways don't listen to the devil as I said one time ago the devil is a liar a liar he has always been he'll always be a liar when the devil tells you look left what it means is that look right when he says it is not from God that means is coming from God praise be to God so for every time just know just this morning something I have down I just don't know for what reason when I woke up it's like something else came in even though I have it I did not print it out it's on my computer at work and that writer came in and that is what I'm going to talk about at this point what I have here it's not to say it it's not important but it looks like we'll be talking about this another time when I don't know but well we have reached actually gets me into the next phase of what we are going to talk about that is situations that call for prayer and I have enough time to put this one in bear with me I don't know whether I was going to talk about it this morning so I just wrote it in ink so there are certain situations in our lives that would draw us onto our knees and what I'm going to talk about today is desperation I want us to read from Luke 22:44 Luke 22:44 look 2244 okay and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground praise be to God this was the Lord Jesus Christ shortly before his crucifixion in the garden when he first saw what was going to go through desperation set in being in agony that is why desperation comes in he saw what was going to go through the shame the humiliation the reproach the pain the agony it was just too much just imagine the Lord Jesus Christ all his life was just nothing but what prayer prayer prayer but on a point where he prayed he prayed more earnestly to the sweat of his face began to drop like cross of blood was shortly before his crucifixion now in times of desperation if you're a child of God and I'm saying that again if you are a child of God it draws you closer to God because desperation is not necessarily a good thing it can draw you closer to God and it can send you far away from God it depends on where you stand last week one better one was preaching he talked about John Wesley and his wife that John Wesley credited his prayer life to his wife you would think oh he was patting him on the back oh and it's time to pray it's time to pray get up and pray no as you said last week she was not just a woman who had a mouth she also had the muscles you can imagine how she was pulling the Prophet throwing him up and down in the room and it's a dangerous thing when a woman can beat a man I don't know we've all been children before if you see three children and one can beat the other the wonder is stronger doesn't have you you need a week of and you don't have to provoke him he just comes and he looks at you and I said no you deserve some beating today that is all it takes and then they get on you why because they know they can beat you so a woman that can beat a man that is what it takes and I don't think sometimes your voice leaving would have to provoke here and I see him crying so on his meal one is me it's I know it's you you deserve a little more just wait till I finish with you and imagine just all of this he goes what is it that's precious sitting in and then it drove him more onto his knees to pray and we see the face of God more but there isn't why I say that spreadsheet can be a button it's if you are not standing in the Lord if you are on the borderline if you are sitting on the fence if today is one leg in tomorrow one leg out when this pressure sets in what it does is that it keeps you away it keeps you out of fellowship it keeps you out of prayer that is one way you begin to look around seeking solutions outside of God and that is where you find people going and consulting Oracle's consulting mediums people looking for answers in the whiskey bottle people looking for answers in the nightclubs why because at the point where the expression was setting in they were not standing in the Lord so it took them in a different direction it doesn't necessarily mean that when that happens and it doesn't draw you closer to God a trustee of balance it doesn't necessarily mean that you are not a child of God but one thing that is sure is that you understanding well it doesn't mean you are not a child of God somehow God is so gonna lead you back home somehow somehow how God does it nobody knows yes but somehow God is going to bring you in desperation can be a good thing and it can be a bad thing and that is one situation that actually can draw you very close to God or can send you very far away from God as I was looking I did this morning as I said I didn't plan for this they just came in and I believe it is for a very good reason bad can't cause you to be desperate what causes the spiration storms when there is a storm in your life it causes desperation and what is a stone a storm can come as a result of a trail and a storm can come as a result of a temptation a trail coming from God temptations coming from the devil they're both generate stones and that would cause you to go on your knees and to seek God and as I was looking at this looking at it this morning I saw job that God creating a storm in the life of job God can create a storm in your life and that storm would be to draw you closer to spice up your prayer life you wouldn't like it what you go through you may have headaches hot eggs sleepless nights but just come to think of it the girl is behind it for a very good cause and sometimes we can also generate our own storms look at something there was absolutely no reason why something was supposed to go to what he went through he had another Islam he didn't have to cut his hair the finishes didn't know posture of mendes was a very shot tiny man with that sort of voltage in him they were all shocked what sort of man he was but they knew there was the secret behind his strength and Delilah would come Oh what is the source of your strength just you know going around and something created his own stone he knew what you are so supposed to do and he gave into it he bought into it Delilah was not Samson's enemy Delilah was not his problem the Philistines were not Samson's problem Samson's problem was something himself he created his own stone sometimes we create our own stones we create situations situations of desperation in our life and when that happens it takes nothing by the grace of God to get you out because God is not behind it I remember when trials come trails are not meant for us to fail no trails are meant to promote us you are in stage one God wants to carry to stage two so you have to write the exam right to go to the next stage so God brings a storm it's not meant for you to fail God would not bring a trial so you would fail no he doesn't do that but when you create your own storms it's a different deal altogether but always know even when you have created your own stone that a god we are seven it's a second chance god he will give you a second chance at that chance a fourth chance I'm not preaching this morning but when something could feel the hair on his head coming and he held those pillars and once again he prays remember our God is a prayer answering God well God is a prayer answering God it doesn't matter how low you have fallen my time is all praise be to God if you can just trace your steps back and then identify yourself with God and spray your grass and cry out to God praise be to God God is going to vindicate himself alright so the time is up I don't know why I had to go through this route this morning but I believe it was for a very good cause shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus with me so very much for this morning and we thank you Lord for the pieces of wastes that have come out this morning father for the encouragement of the instance and others to spice up our prayer life Lord and to draw us nigh on today now we shall seek your face more than we have ever done before now we shall know the weapon of warfare we have Lord not such as the word gives not a power that we have when we go down to pray we pray dear Lord Jesus that you would help us father in our walk with you Lord give us faith get us out of the shelf load the shots of humanity get us into thine inner courts help us dear Lord Jesus and let your perfect will be done in our life you have given us prayer as a weapon of warfare let us record in this weapon of war free that it is mighty as the Bible says to the pulling down of strongholds it is not a mean weapon of warfare that when we pray and we believe it shall be done we commit the next process of the service into thine hands Lord may you come and inhabit our praise this morning may you come a minister unto us from lip to ear address the needs and the concerns we have Lord and channel your word towards them that none of us dear Lord Jesus would leave your persons the way we came in in Jesus name Amen god bless you sense [Music] [Music]
