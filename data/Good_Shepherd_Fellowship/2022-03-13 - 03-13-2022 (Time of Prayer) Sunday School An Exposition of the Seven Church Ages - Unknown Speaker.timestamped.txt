[3:27] [Music]
[3:34] it must be accepted and believed by
[3:36] faith
[3:37] some will be offended by what i have set
[3:39] forth because they fail to understand
[3:41] the sovereignty of god which sets forth
[3:44] that god is god and because he is god
[3:47] one cannot defeat his counsels or thwart
[3:50] his will and purpose
[3:52] but he being omnipotent is ruling in all
[3:54] affairs and is doing whatever he will
[3:57] with all his creation because all were
[3:59] created for his good pleasure
[4:02] therefore as paul says
[4:04] if god should take a one lump of clay
[4:06] and make of that same lump one vessel
[4:08] unto honor and another vessel unto
[4:10] dishonor who can be offended and cry
[4:12] against him
[4:14] that he has the right to do this on the
[4:16] grounds of creation alone we cannot deny
[4:20] yet he went even further for according
[4:22] to romans 14 7-9
[4:25] we have the irrefutable proof that jesus
[4:28] paid the purchase price of the whole
[4:29] world
[4:30] and therefore he can do as he wills with
[4:33] his own
[4:34] for none of us liveth to himself and no
[4:36] man dies to himself
[4:38] for whether we live we live unto the
[4:40] lord
[4:41] and whether we die we die unto the lord
[4:44] whether we live therefore or die we are
[4:47] the lords
[4:48] for to this end christ both died and
[4:51] rose and revived that he might be lord
[4:54] both of the dead and living
[4:56] ownership not relationship is meant here
[5:00] this is also set forth in john 17 2.
[5:04] as thou hast given him power over all
[5:06] flesh
[5:07] that he should give eternal life to as
[5:09] many as thou hast given him
[5:12] now if we impute omniscience to god we
[5:14] must also accept that he is perfect in
[5:17] wisdom and righteousness
[5:19] this plan of election and reprobation is
[5:21] the wisdom of god revealed in all ages
[5:24] even as it says in ephesians 1
[5:26] 3-11
[5:28] blessed be the god and father of our
[5:30] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[5:33] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[5:35] places in christ
[5:36] according as he hath chosen us in him
[5:39] before the foundation of the world
[5:41] that we should be holy and without blame
[5:43] before him
[5:44] in love having predestinated us under
[5:47] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[5:49] to himself
[5:50] according to the good pleasure of his
[5:52] will
[5:52] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[5:55] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[5:57] beloved
[5:58] in whom we have redemption through his
[6:00] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[6:03] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[6:06] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[6:08] and prudence
[6:10] having made known unto us the mystery of
[6:12] his will according to his good pleasure
[6:14] which he hath purposed in himself
[6:17] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[6:19] of times he might gather together in one
[6:21] all things in christ
[6:23] both which are in heaven and which are
[6:25] on earth even in him
[6:28] in whom also we have obtained an
[6:29] inheritance
[6:31] being predestined according to the
[6:33] purpose of him who worketh all things
[6:35] after the council of his own will
[6:38] thus if god has so designed that there
[6:40] be those whose names are placed in a
[6:42] section of the lamb's book of life and
[6:44] cannot be erased for they are the names
[6:47] of his bride
[6:48] then we must accept that
[6:51] if it also states that there are those
[6:53] whose names were placed in the record of
[6:54] the book of life but in the
[6:56] foreknowledge of god they were to fall
[6:58] and have their names removed we must
[7:00] accept that and if there are those whose
[7:03] names were never placed upon a record of
[7:05] life we must accept that also
[7:08] and if there are those who will enter
[7:10] into life eternal after the white throne
[7:12] judgment solely on the grounds of being
[7:14] good and kind and just to the elect of
[7:17] god who are his brethren then we cannot
[7:19] but accept that
[7:21] for who knoweth the mind of the lord
[7:23] that he should instruct him
[7:25] rather let us be subject in faith to him
[7:27] who is our father and live
[7:31] to understand this subject even more
[7:33] clearly
[7:34] it will now be wise to approach it from
[7:36] the standpoint of the church through the
[7:37] ages
[7:39] up until now we have been thinking in
[7:40] terms of the removal of the names of
[7:42] individuals
[7:44] now we want to consider not the
[7:45] individuals but the groups represented
[7:48] in the church
[7:49] to do so we will liken the church
[7:51] through the ages to the wheat plant
[7:53] a grain of wheat is planted to the end
[7:55] that a single grain of wheat will
[7:57] reproduce and multiply itself through a
[7:59] certain process during a certain period
[8:01] of time
[8:03] that single seed will die
[8:05] but in dying the life that was in it
[8:07] will come up into a plant
[8:09] which in turn will be the bearer or
[8:11] carrier of that life which is to come
[8:12] back to originality in a multiplied form
[8:16] jesus the great royal seed died
[8:19] that matchless one who is the life of
[8:21] the church stands in the midst of the
[8:24] church for all seven church ages giving
[8:26] his life to the church the carrier or
[8:28] bearer
[8:29] to the end that his very life will be
[8:31] reproduced in bodies like unto his in
[8:34] the resurrection
[8:36] it is at the resurrection that the royal
[8:37] seed will see many royal seeds like unto
[8:40] himself
[8:41] and they will be even as he is for says
[8:44] john
[8:44] we shall be like him
[8:47] this is what john the baptist was
[8:49] referring to when he said that jesus
[8:51] would gather the wheat into the garner
[8:53] that was the resurrection where the
[8:55] redeemed who had been elected unto
[8:56] eternal life came in
[8:59] now then the record of this wheat plant
[9:01] whose end is to reproduce the original
[9:03] seed in multiplied form is the book of
[9:05] life
[9:06] by
[9:07] the history or record of this wheat
[9:09] plant is the book of life of which a
[9:12] part of the book of life is the record
[9:13] of eternal life
[9:15] a section of the book of life
[9:18] this is convincingly seen by examining
[9:20] the wheat plant
[9:21] a bear seed is sown
[9:23] soon a blade is seen
[9:25] but that is not the wheat yet
[9:28] then it grows into a stalk
[9:30] this is not yet wheat
[9:32] life is there but not the wheat
[9:35] then at the end of the stalk is a little
[9:36] spike that sends out a tassel
[9:38] still a wheat plant but no wheat yet
[9:42] then the plant is pollenized and we see
[9:44] the chaff grow
[9:46] this looks mighty like the wheat but it
[9:48] is not yet seed then forms the wheat in
[9:51] the husk
[9:52] it is now back to what it was originally
[9:54] now the ripened wheat is harvested
[9:57] jesus christ died
[9:59] he gave his life
[10:01] that life was to come back upon the
[10:02] church and bring many sons like unto
[10:04] himself unto glory and the resurrection
[10:07] but as the wheat seed had to have a
[10:09] carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat
[10:11] seed
[10:12] even so there had to be a church which
[10:14] would be the carrier of the life of
[10:16] christ
[10:17] as the blade stalk
[10:19] tassel and husks were the carriers for
[10:21] the seed but not the seed itself
[10:24] so the church corporate through the ages
[10:26] has been the carrier of the true seed
[10:28] though not the seed itself
[10:31] that is why we can say that the book of
[10:32] life is the whole wheat plant
[10:35] let's go over that again
[10:38] here is that original seed that was
[10:39] planted
[10:40] it produced a blade
[10:42] that wasn't it
[10:44] it produced a stalk
[10:45] not it either
[10:47] here come husks in which the wheat is to
[10:49] form
[10:50] that isn't it
[10:51] the tassel appears
[10:53] then pollen falls on those pistols
[10:55] part of that plant is quickened
[10:58] something of that original seed that
[10:59] came up through the rest of the plant
[11:01] turns into seed
[11:03] why didn't the whole plant go into seed
[11:06] because it was created to that end
[11:09] just part of that plant can go back to
[11:11] being seed because just part of that
[11:13] wheat plant is eternal life wheat
[11:16] you have a perfect type of that in
[11:18] israel leaving egypt
[11:20] they came out about 2 million strong
[11:22] all escaped through the sacrificial
[11:24] blood
[11:25] all were baptized in the red sea all
[11:28] came up out of the water enjoying holy
[11:30] spirit manifestation and blessings
[11:32] all ate angel food
[11:35] all drank of the rock that followed them
[11:37] yet except for a very few they were not
[11:40] but carriers for the children who should
[11:42] follow them and go into canaanland
[11:44] all israel is not israel
[11:47] and all but a tiny minority had their
[11:49] names blotted out of the book of life
[11:53] we have the same right today in the
[11:54] church names are going to be blotted out
[11:57] of the book of life
[11:59] no names will be blotted out of the book
[12:01] of eternal life for that is another
[12:02] record though contained in the book of
[12:04] life
[12:05] this is the record
[12:08] god hath given us eternal life
[12:10] and this life is in his son
[12:13] he that hath the son hath life eternal
[12:16] and he that hath not the son hath not
[12:19] life eternal
[12:21] and those who have that life were in him
[12:23] before the foundation of the world
[12:25] they were chosen in him before the
[12:27] foundation of the world
[12:29] that great royal seed jesus christ was
[12:32] planted
[12:33] he died
[12:34] and that life that was in him came up
[12:36] through the wheat plant and is
[12:37] reproducing itself in multitudes of
[12:39] wheat seeds having the same life in them
[12:42] and being like the original because by
[12:44] spirit they are original
[12:47] now we can see why the redeemed
[12:49] bought back by original owner bride
[12:52] she was in him as eve was in adam cannot
[12:55] ever have her member names taken off the
[12:57] record
[12:58] she is part of him she is in the throne
[13:02] she can never be judged
[13:04] everyone in the bride is a member of him
[13:06] and he loses none
[13:08] but that is not so concerning the all in
[13:10] the book of life
[13:12] for amongst them are even those like
[13:14] judas etc
[13:16] who have a part in the record but their
[13:17] names are removed
[13:19] we can see those who come in the last
[13:21] days and after having done wonderful
[13:23] works jesus will say that he never knew
[13:25] them
[13:26] it is not that he was not aware of them
[13:29] his omniscience precludes that
[13:31] but they were not for known as in the
[13:33] bride
[13:34] and neither were they for known as
[13:36] amongst the righteous of the second
[13:37] resurrection
[13:38] they bore no fruit
[13:40] because they were outside the word did
[13:42] not abide in it
[13:44] and they therefore were sentenced to
[13:46] death
[13:47] then as we have previously shown there
[13:49] are those who stood for the bride and
[13:51] were an aide and comfort to her
[13:53] those had their names remaining on the
[13:55] book of life and go into life
[13:57] everlasting
[13:58] finally there are those such as pharaoh
[14:01] who never had their names on the book of
[14:03] life and these are cast into the lake of
[14:05] fire also
[14:07] thus the grain of wheat that became a
[14:09] plant for the harvest is the record of
[14:11] the church
[14:12] and even as not all the wheat plant is
[14:14] wheat seed and as not all the plant is
[14:17] used in the harvest so with the church
[14:20] all the church is not the bride
[14:22] and neither is it all given eternal life
[14:25] but a part of it is gathered into the
[14:26] garner
[14:27] and a part of it is kept that it might
[14:30] enter into eternal life in the second
[14:32] resurrection
[14:33] and part of it which is accounted chaff
[14:35] is burned in the lake of fire
[14:38] and this is exactly what john the
[14:39] baptist and jesus said
[14:41] for john said that the wheat would be
[14:43] garnered and the chaff burned
[14:45] jesus said
[14:47] bind the tares and then gather the wheat
[14:50] the ecumenical move will bind the tare
[14:52] churches together for the tares must be
[14:54] bound first
[14:56] and though their end is burning they are
[14:58] not burned at their binding but are
[15:00] reserved to a later date which is at the
[15:02] end of the thousand years or the second
[15:04] resurrection
[15:06] but once the tears are bound the rapture
[15:08] can take place and does so at some time
[15:10] between the binding and the revelation
[15:12] of antichrist
[15:14] then will come the day when all stand
[15:16] together as seen in daniel
[15:18] the king will be there with his bride
[15:21] and in front of them will be the
[15:22] multitudes who are to be judged
[15:24] yes all are there
[15:27] all the books are opened a final
[15:29] disposition of all is made
[15:31] the harvest is indeed over
[15:34] the books once opened are closed
[15:37] in concluding this subject for this time
[15:40] let me refer to a statement made at its
[15:42] beginning wherein i said that not one
[15:44] scripture spoke of the lord presently
[15:46] compiling a record of names
[15:48] that is indeed so
[15:50] however there is a scripture pointing a
[15:52] future compilation
[15:54] it is in the 87th psalm
[15:57] this psalm speaks of the lord writing up
[15:59] the names of all those born in zion
[16:01] on no account can it be presumed that
[16:04] god has to wait until the end of ages or
[16:06] that period of time dealing with zion in
[16:09] order to know who all might be born in
[16:11] zion
[16:12] again that would preclude omniscience
[16:14] surely he knows who all comprised that
[16:16] number
[16:17] but what is it
[16:19] is it not simply the revised role
[16:21] wherein god simply places in a new
[16:23] record those names which remained after
[16:25] the second resurrection and pertain to
[16:27] zion
[16:28] surely that is it
[16:30] and i will confess his name before my
[16:32] father and his angels
[16:34] roll call in heaven
[16:37] if a man dies shall he live again
[16:39] all the days of my appointed time will i
[16:41] wait till my change come
[16:43] thou shalt call and i will answer thee
[16:46] thou wilt have a desire to the work of
[16:48] thy hands
[16:50] the great shepherd is calling his sheep
[16:52] by name
[16:53] the creative voice of god is calling
[16:55] them forth from the dust or changing
[16:57] their atoms even though they had not
[16:58] fallen asleep
[17:00] it is the rapture
[17:02] it is the great marriage supper of the
[17:04] lamb and his bride
[17:06] but the rapture is not the only roll
[17:08] call
[17:09] there at the second resurrection at the
[17:11] great white throne judgment will names
[17:13] be confessed before the father and his
[17:15] angels
[17:16] now i have been told by those who know
[17:19] that the sweetest sound to a human ear
[17:21] is the sound of that person's name
[17:24] how people love to have their names
[17:26] before the public how they love acclaim
[17:29] but no earthly voice will ever sound
[17:31] your name as sweetly as will the voice
[17:33] of god if your name is in the book of
[17:35] life and remains there to be revealed
[17:37] before the holy angels
[17:39] what a day that will be when we hear
[17:41] jesus say
[17:43] father they confessed my name before men
[17:45] in the days of their earthly pilgrimage
[17:48] now i will confess their names before
[17:50] thee and all the heavenly angels
[17:53] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[17:55] the spirit saith to the churches
[17:58] once more the spirit had spoken
[18:00] once again we have reviewed the record
[18:02] of what the spirit said to another age
[18:05] and we have found the record correct
[18:08] another age has gone by and it was
[18:09] fulfilled exactly as he said it would be
[18:12] what a consolation that is to us who
[18:14] hope to be in the last day bride
[18:17] for it causes our hearts to leap for joy
[18:19] that he is faithful and will perform his
[18:21] every promise
[18:23] if he was faithful and true to those of
[18:25] the sardisian age
[18:27] then he is just as true to this our age
[18:30] if they by his grace and power will be
[18:32] received and commanded by him then so
[18:35] will we
[18:36] let us go therefore to perfection and
[18:39] meet the lord in the air
[18:41] and be forever with him
[18:46] chapter 8 the philadelphian church age
[18:50] revelation 3
[18:52] 7-13
[18:55] and to the angel of the church in
[18:57] philadelphia write
[18:59] these things saith he that is holy he
[19:01] that is true
[19:03] he that hath the key of david he that
[19:05] openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth
[19:08] and no man openeth
[19:11] i know thy works
[19:12] behold i have set before thee an open
[19:15] door and no man can shut it for thou
[19:17] hast to little strength and has kept my
[19:19] word and has not denied my name
[19:22] behold i will make them of the synagogue
[19:25] of satan which say they are jews and are
[19:27] not but do lie
[19:29] behold i will make them to come and
[19:31] worship before thy feet and to know that
[19:33] i have loved thee
[19:36] because thou hast kept the word of my
[19:38] patience
[19:39] i also will keep thee from the hour of
[19:41] temptation which shall come upon all the
[19:43] world to try them that dwell upon the
[19:46] earth
[19:47] behold i come quickly
[19:49] hold that fast which thou hast that no
[19:52] man take thy crown
[19:54] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[19:56] in the temple of my god
[19:58] and he shall go no more out
[20:00] and i will write upon him the name of my
[20:03] god and the name of the city of my god
[20:05] which is new jerusalem
[20:07] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[20:09] god
[20:10] and i will write upon him my new name
[20:13] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[20:15] the spirit saith unto the churches
[20:19] philadelphia
[20:21] philadelphia was 75 miles southeast of
[20:24] sardis it was the second largest city in
[20:26] lydia it was built upon several hills in
[20:29] a famous wine growing district its coins
[20:31] bore the head of backers and the figure
[20:33] of a bacanti priestess of bacchus
[20:37] the population of the city included jews
[20:39] christians of jewish origin and converts
[20:41] from heathenism
[20:43] the city suffered frequent earthquakes
[20:45] yet its duration was the longest of the
[20:47] seven cities of revelation
[20:49] in fact the city still exists under the
[20:51] turkish name of al-shahir or city of god
[20:55] the mintage of the coins suggests the
[20:57] deity of the city to be bacchus
[20:59] now bacchus is the same as ninus or
[21:01] nimrod
[21:02] he is the lamented one though most of us
[21:05] think of him in terms of revelry and
[21:06] drunkenness
[21:08] what illumination this brings to our
[21:09] minds
[21:10] here is a coin with the god on one side
[21:13] and the priestess or prophetess on the
[21:14] other
[21:15] now flip a coin
[21:17] does it matter which way it comes down
[21:19] no sir it is still the same coin
[21:22] that is the romish religion of jesus and
[21:24] mary
[21:25] but we are not thinking of rome only
[21:28] no there is not only the great harlot
[21:30] certainly not for she by her
[21:32] fornications has become a mother
[21:34] her daughters now are coins of the same
[21:36] mintage
[21:38] there on one side of the coin they have
[21:39] drawn up a worship of jesus and on the
[21:42] other side they have their priestess or
[21:44] prophetess also and she writes her
[21:46] creeds and dogmas and tenets and sells
[21:49] them to the people for salvation
[21:51] insisting that she and she alone has the
[21:53] true light
[21:55] how remarkable is the fact that this age
[21:57] is characterized by the coin
[21:59] for the mother and daughters are all
[22:01] buying their way to heaven
[22:03] money and not blood is the purchase
[22:05] price
[22:06] money and not spirit is the power that
[22:08] moves them ahead
[22:09] the god of this world mammon hath
[22:11] blinded their eyes
[22:13] but their dealings in death will end
[22:15] soon for this is the age that the spirit
[22:17] cries behold i come quickly
[22:20] even so come quickly lord jesus
[22:24] the age
[22:27] the philadelphia church age lasted from
[22:29] 1750 to about 1906.
[22:32] this age due to the meaning of the name
[22:34] of the city has been called the age of
[22:36] brotherly love as philadelphia means
[22:39] love of brethren
[22:42] the messenger
[22:45] the messenger to this age was without
[22:47] doubt john wesley
[22:48] john wesley was born at epworth june 17
[22:51] 1703 and was one of 19 children born to
[22:54] samuel and susannah wesley
[22:56] his father was a chaplain in the church
[22:58] of england
[22:59] but it is more than likely that the
[23:01] religious turn of john's mind was based
[23:03] more upon his mother's exemplary life
[23:05] than upon his father's theology
[23:08] john was a brilliant scholar
[23:09] it was while he was at oxford that he
[23:11] and charles became part of a group who
[23:13] were spiritually exercised to worship on
[23:16] the basis of experientially living the
[23:18] truth rather than making doctrine their
[23:20] standard
[23:21] they drew up a spiritual guide of works
[23:24] such as giving to the poor visiting the
[23:26] sick and the imprisoned
[23:28] for this they were called methodists and
[23:30] other derisive titles
[23:32] now john was sufficiently imbued by his
[23:34] vision of the need of religion for the
[23:36] peoples of the world that he went to
[23:37] america georgia as a missionary amongst
[23:40] the indians on his way there he found
[23:43] that many of the ship's passengers were
[23:44] moravians
[23:46] he was deeply impressed by their
[23:47] meekness peace and courage in all
[23:49] circumstances
[23:50] his labors in georgia in spite of
[23:52] self-denials and hard work was a failure
[23:55] he returned to england crying
[23:57] i went to america to convert the indians
[23:59] but oh who shall convert me
[24:02] back in london he again met the
[24:04] moravians
[24:05] it was peter buller who showed him the
[24:07] way of salvation
[24:09] he was truly born again much to the
[24:10] dismay and evident anger of his brother
[24:12] charles who could not understand how
[24:14] such a spiritual man as john should say
[24:17] he was not formally right with god
[24:20] it was however not long after that
[24:22] charles ii was saved by grace
[24:25] wesley now began to preach the gospel in
[24:27] those pulpits in london to which he
[24:28] formerly had access
[24:30] but soon they turned him out
[24:32] it was at this time that his old friend
[24:34] george whitefield stood him in good
[24:36] stead for he invited john to come and
[24:38] help him preach in the fields where
[24:40] thousands were listening to the word
[24:42] wesley at first was incredulous that he
[24:44] should preach in the open instead of a
[24:46] building
[24:47] but when he saw the throngs and saw the
[24:49] working of the gospel in the power of
[24:51] the spirit he turned wholeheartedly to
[24:53] such preaching
[24:54] the work soon took on such proportions
[24:56] that he began sending out numerous
[24:58] laymen to preach the word
[25:00] this seemed like a parallel to pentecost
[25:02] where the spirit raised up men with
[25:04] power to preach and teach the word
[25:06] almost overnight
[25:08] there was violent opposition to his work
[25:10] but god was with him
[25:12] the workings of the spirit were mightily
[25:14] manifested and often such a spirit of
[25:16] conviction took hold of the people as to
[25:18] take away their strength and they would
[25:20] fall to the ground crying in great
[25:21] distress over their sins
[25:24] wesley was a remarkably strong man
[25:26] he says of himself that he could not
[25:28] remember to have felt lowness of spirits
[25:31] for even a quarter hour since he was
[25:32] born
[25:33] he slept no more than six hours a day
[25:36] arose in time to start preaching at five
[25:38] practically every day of his ministry
[25:40] preached up to four times on a single
[25:42] day so that in a year he would average
[25:44] over 800 sermons
[25:47] he traveled multiple thousands of miles
[25:49] as did his circuit riders who carried
[25:51] the gospel near and far
[25:53] in fact wesley traveled 4 500 miles per
[25:56] year by horse
[25:58] he was a believer in the power of god
[26:00] and he prayed for the sick with great
[26:02] faith and wonderful results
[26:04] many of his meetings saw the
[26:05] manifestation of spiritual gifts
[26:08] wesley was not in favor of organization
[26:11] his associates did have a united society
[26:14] who were a company of men having the
[26:16] form and seeking the power of godliness
[26:19] united in order to pray together to
[26:21] receive the word of exhortation and to
[26:23] watch over one another in love that they
[26:26] may help each other to work out their
[26:27] salvation
[26:29] the only condition of those entering was
[26:31] they should be of those
[26:33] who had a desire to flee from the wrath
[26:35] to come and to be saved from their sins
[26:38] as time went on they worked out a strict
[26:40] set of rules to be used in
[26:41] self-discipline for the good of their
[26:43] souls
[26:44] wesley recognized that after his death
[26:46] the movement could be organized and the
[26:48] spirit of god leave them to dead form
[26:51] he once remarked that he did not fear
[26:53] that the name of methodist would leave
[26:54] the earth but that the spirit might take
[26:56] his flight
[26:58] during his lifetime he could have
[27:00] acquired vast wealth but he did not
[27:03] his favorite saying on the subject of
[27:05] money was get all you can save all you
[27:08] can and give all you can
[27:10] how strange it would be for wesley to
[27:12] come back and see the denomination that
[27:13] bears the name of methodist today
[27:16] they are rich vastly rich
[27:18] but the life and power of john wesley is
[27:20] missing
[27:22] it should also be mentioned that wesley
[27:24] never did desire to build a work upon a
[27:26] denominational or sectarian basis
[27:29] though he was an armenian in his beliefs
[27:31] he did not want to separate himself from
[27:33] brethren on the grounds of doctrine
[27:36] he was a good candidate for james he
[27:38] based his eternal life on faith and
[27:40] works or the living of the life rather
[27:42] than simply accepting a creed or a
[27:44] doctrinal statement
[27:46] john wesley died at the age of 88 having
[27:49] served god as few men would dare to even
[27:51] think they might
