[36:06] jesus
[36:08] he said if if you'll just mention my
[36:10] name even in prayer i'll come on by
[36:14] so if if we've been
[36:16] crying out and
[36:18] reaching out and praying in his name
[36:20] already we know he's here
[36:22] he's with us he's here in this place his
[36:25] presence is here with us he's standing
[36:27] here by each one of us
[36:29] he's ready to meet your need you see
[36:33] we've we've come here gathered together
[36:34] because it's
[36:36] something he placed in his word he said
[36:38] gather together because this this is a
[36:40] way you'll draw strength one from
[36:42] another he said that's what the body's
[36:44] for
[36:47] but
[36:49] we're not drawing each other's strength
[36:53] we're not drawing from
[36:55] some power
[36:57] personally that each one of us has
[37:00] it's not our human ability
[37:03] it's not our intellect
[37:06] it's not our
[37:08] our uh
[37:11] emotional strength
[37:12] [Music]
[37:14] that we're drawing from each other
[37:16] but each one of us
[37:18] has brought that name with us
[37:21] each one of us has brought that lick of
[37:22] fire along with us
[37:24] and as those licks of fire come together
[37:27] it's like a fire that's been scattered
[37:29] abroad
[37:31] the little twigs are a
[37:34] piece of wood here and there that's got
[37:35] a flame
[37:36] on their own they
[37:38] they'll burn
[37:40] but as you bring them together
[37:42] the the intensity multiplies
[37:45] it doesn't just stay little licks of
[37:46] fire on the ground
[37:48] but he turned turns into a bonfire a
[37:51] raging flame
[37:53] and that's how we draw strength because
[37:55] maybe there's one or two of you your
[37:57] fire was maybe almost out
[37:59] maybe there's just a few embers or maybe
[38:02] you're just a
[38:03] fresh piece of wood here this morning
[38:06] as you get laid into that bonfire with
[38:09] all the flames that's already
[38:12] glowing
[38:13] it's no power of the wood it's the power
[38:16] of the fire it can light your life here
[38:19] this morning
[38:20] and you can walk out of here on fire too
[38:24] and we're so thankful for that
[38:27] that's yes i'm i get nervous and then i
[38:30] just start talking and i'll i'll wander
[38:32] around so musicians thank you so much i
[38:34] appreciate it
[38:36] i just have a little thought nothing
[38:39] nothing real new this morning
[38:41] um
[38:42] just something hopefully that will
[38:44] encourage your heart something that
[38:46] you'll be able to take along down the
[38:47] road
[38:50] let's just
[38:51] let's go ahead and turn in our scripture
[38:55] to
[39:08] isaiah 29 and 13.
[39:28] and it says
[39:29] wherefore the lord said
[39:31] for as much as this people draw near me
[39:34] with their mouth
[39:36] and with their lips to honor me
[39:38] but have removed their heart
[39:40] far from me
[39:42] and their fear toward me is taught
[39:46] by the precepts of men
[39:50] and we're going to jump over to
[39:52] matthew chapter 15.
[39:59] and verses eight through nine
[40:08] actually start with verse seven
[40:15] ye hypocrites well did essays prophesy
[40:18] of you saying
[40:21] this people draw nigh unto me with their
[40:24] mouth and honoreth me with their lips
[40:26] but their heart
[40:28] is far from me
[40:31] but in vain
[40:32] they do worship me teaching for
[40:34] doctrines
[40:35] the commandments of men
[40:38] let's pray
[40:41] heavenly father lord we just come before
[40:43] you once again this morning father just
[40:45] so thankful to be here before you father
[40:47] lord i
[40:49] just ask that you just come on down and
[40:51] have your way this morning father to set
[40:53] me to the side father lord
[40:56] lord speak to your people father lord
[40:58] may i just be a
[40:59] instrument in your hand father
[41:02] lord it or if there's something you can
[41:04] use from these thoughts these little
[41:07] things perhaps i've studied on tonight
[41:09] surrender them to you father and lord if
[41:12] you have something else then i surrender
[41:14] myself to you as well
[41:16] or just ask you to bless your people
[41:18] lord and have your way in this service
[41:20] we pray in jesus name
[41:22] amen
[41:24] you may be seated
[41:26] i want to take a
[41:27] thought here
[41:29] and speak on
[41:31] converting the heart of man
[41:33] to the heart of god
[41:35] you know
[41:44] i've been thinking on this you know last
[41:46] service brother one spoke on
[41:49] he touched on this and and saying how
[41:53] sometimes when we think a certain way
[41:57] or we see something a certain way it's
[41:59] because of how we've been taught or our
[42:02] religious
[42:03] um view on it
[42:05] and really when god's looking to do a
[42:07] whole another thing
[42:09] you know and
[42:11] that's the place that the people found
[42:13] themselves in both instances here and we
[42:16] find out that it's not something new
[42:18] this goes all the way back to genesis
[42:20] with cain and abel
[42:22] you see
[42:23] one had a revelation of what god wanted
[42:27] him to do
[42:28] and the other one was trying to work
[42:31] something up
[42:34] so that he felt like he had some part in
[42:37] it so he could claim it for his own
[42:41] in a way that he felt then god owed it
[42:44] to him
[42:46] because it has
[42:48] not because god's word wasn't there it
[42:51] wasn't because they weren't reading the
[42:52] same scripture
[42:54] it wasn't because they didn't have the
[42:55] same pastor all the way back to cain and
[42:57] abel
[42:58] they had
[42:59] they had adam himself the man who had
[43:01] heard it from god's own lips lips to ear
[43:05] to teach them
[43:08] and preach to them the same word
[43:11] the exact same word same thing in isaiah
[43:13] they all had the old testament prophets
[43:16] they all had the books of moses
[43:18] they all had to memorize most of them
[43:22] from the time they were a child even if
[43:23] they couldn't read
[43:25] in the synagogue it was taught to them
[43:28] so thoroughly that they could recite it
[43:31] to you
[43:32] word for word for word for word
[43:36] same thing we come up here into the
[43:38] book of matthew and jesus is repeating
[43:41] them back the same thing he said you
[43:43] guys are still stuck in this same rut
[43:46] he said the word of god is here
[43:49] it's it's playing out before your very
[43:52] eyes
[43:52] but because it doesn't match
[43:55] what you think it should
[43:59] it's not good enough for you
[44:02] you see because
[44:04] in the book of moses
[44:05] moses gave them
[44:07] ten commandments
[44:08] and within those ten commandments there
[44:10] was about i think i i just
[44:13] with a really little bit of research
[44:16] there was about 631
[44:18] rules or explanations to those
[44:20] commandments
[44:24] that was god speaking to moses giving
[44:27] his people direct instruction on how to
[44:30] live on how to obey the word how to live
[44:33] according to the word that was god's
[44:36] direct instruction
[44:38] and yet from the time of moses to the
[44:40] time of jesus
[44:42] they wrote a whole another list and
[44:46] books of instruction
[44:48] to interpret those laws interpret those
[44:52] commandments
[44:53] to make them work for them
[44:57] you see it's the same nicolaitan spirit
[45:01] you say when did that nicoletan spirit
[45:03] start to ride
[45:05] and it it started the ride the same time
[45:09] as when christ came on the scene
[45:11] because we know there's always twins in
[45:13] the scripture
[45:15] so if we see
[45:16] god moving we know
[45:18] on the other side it's moving
[45:21] it's rising up to me that we think the
[45:23] nickelodeon spirit didn't start all the
[45:24] way up until while there was no roman
[45:26] catholic church that rome wasn't
[45:28] involved yet
[45:29] but it started way back here
[45:32] it's it's riding and moving
[45:36] right there
[45:39] and
[45:45] it says
[45:48] they draw ninety with their mouth
[45:51] and honor me with their lips
[45:53] but their heart is far from me
[45:56] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[45:58] for doctrines the commandments of men
[46:01] and you'll see this
[46:03] continuously throughout history
[46:07] is that
[46:09] the church
[46:11] has a knowledge of the word but does not
[46:14] believe it
[46:18] now we need to define the word believe
[46:21] we need to
[46:22] because believe is used very loosely in
[46:25] the english
[46:26] language very loosely
[46:29] if someone tells you like yeah i believe
[46:31] you
[46:32] and you're like no i don't
[46:35] or someone will tell you something
[46:37] you're like yeah i believe that i think
[46:38] that's true and you go and you do
[46:40] completely the opposite thing
[46:42] you don't believe it
[46:44] you've acquired additional knowledge
[46:47] that you're weighing
[46:49] on on how much of it is true
[46:51] but you don't believe it
[46:54] so you have a knowledge of it
[46:56] but not a belief
[46:59] you see
[47:00] because
[47:04] knowledge
[47:11] puff us up
[47:14] right
[47:15] and and in pride you will rise up
[47:19] and say i know better
[47:23] or you say it needs something more it's
[47:25] not enough
[47:27] that's that's good but it's not enough
[47:31] but when you say i believe
[47:33] then that's it it's finished
[47:35] and in the
[47:37] hebrew the term to believe
[47:40] was the word amman a-m-a-n
[47:44] which also interprets to the word faith
[47:49] faith and belief are interchangeably
[47:52] used back to that same hebrew root
[47:55] to have faith is to believe in order to
[47:58] believe you must have faith
[48:02] because the belief has to become an
[48:04] absolute
[48:08] and if it's an absolute
[48:10] you don't need to redefine it
[48:13] you don't need to add to it
[48:15] you don't need to
[48:17] figure it
[48:18] out you don't need to
[48:22] create some type of action
[48:25] to bring it to pass
[48:28] you just have to believe it you have to
[48:30] have faith that it is
[48:33] that he is
[48:36] but if all you have is a knowledge
[48:41] then we find ourself
[48:43] in the same place that the children of
[48:45] israel did
[48:46] continuously throughout their seven
[48:49] church ages
[48:52] and josh i'm actually gonna have you
[48:54] jump in there for me
[48:56] i thought i was gonna be fancy today but
[48:57] i'm too nervous i'm gonna just
[49:01] mix it all up if we go to acts uh
[49:03] chapter 13 20 through 23
[49:08] and it says and after that he gave unto
[49:11] them judges
[49:13] about the space of 450 years until
[49:16] samuel the prophet
[49:17] and afterward they desired a king
[49:20] and god gave unto them saul the son of
[49:23] sis
[49:24] a man of the tribe of benjamin for the
[49:26] space of forty years
[49:29] and when he had removed him
[49:31] he raised up unto them david to be their
[49:34] king
[49:35] to whom also he gave testimony and said
[49:37] i have found
[49:38] david the son of jesse a man after my
[49:41] own heart
[49:42] which shall fulfill all my will
[49:46] of this man's seed hath god according to
[49:48] his promise raised unto israel a savior
[49:51] jesus
[49:53] now
[49:54] you see there's
[49:55] three stages in here that the children
[49:59] of israel went through
[50:01] the first one was
[50:03] judges and prophets
[50:05] now
[50:08] everybody comes under this it doesn't
[50:10] matter if you're a christian doesn't
[50:12] matter if you're religious it doesn't
[50:13] matter who you are
[50:16] but there are god in scripture it says
[50:18] that there's
[50:19] rules
[50:20] and there is a law within a man
[50:26] that he knows
[50:27] right from wrong
[50:32] we all know
[50:33] don't steal you shouldn't lie the basics
[50:37] so there's a law within a man
[50:39] that's the judges
[50:42] because the law in and of itself
[50:45] can't save you
[50:46] it never was meant to do that
[50:50] the law
[50:51] paul told us in the book of romans he
[50:53] said the law all it did
[50:56] was
[50:57] bring me to a realization of my sin
[51:01] and bring forth the fruits of death
[51:05] because there was no coming back from it
[51:10] so here we are in
[51:12] the stage of judges it doesn't matter
[51:14] who
[51:16] everybody is under this stage
[51:21] of judges
[51:22] of the law
[51:24] whether you like it or not
[51:26] you can't escape it
[51:35] if you go to romans chapter 7 verse 1.
[51:39] josh if you put that up
[52:00] know ye not brethren for i speak to them
[52:02] that know the law how the law hath
[52:05] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[52:10] so the moment you're born to the day you
[52:13] die
[52:14] whether you know the law
[52:16] don't know the law it has control over
[52:19] you
[52:20] you know they say they say ignorance is
[52:22] no excuse
[52:25] well i didn't know
[52:27] it doesn't matter it'll take you to
[52:29] prison the same
[52:30] way ignorance is no excuse
[52:34] and that's where we all start out at
[52:37] and then as we as we move along in our
[52:39] in our life or as god is moving on us
[52:41] and you know we he he began to tug and
[52:44] pull on our heart whether we're out in
[52:47] the world we're out in denomination or
[52:48] we'll grow up right here in the pews and
[52:50] the benches of this message
[52:52] you know we get a little religious
[52:55] right we begin to learn the law we learn
[52:58] this and that
[52:59] but
[53:00] but we want to do it our way
[53:03] and that's where the children of israel
[53:04] went to next and afterward they desired
[53:07] a king
[53:09] and god gave them to them saul the son
[53:11] of sis
[53:13] a man of the tribe of benjamin by the
[53:15] space of forty years
[53:21] this was a man after the heart of the
[53:22] people
[53:24] he looked good
[53:26] he acted good
[53:28] he spoke well he was charismatic
[53:34] he knew all the right things to say
[53:39] he could say it well
[53:41] you like being around him
[53:44] he made you feel good
[53:47] but there was no depth
[53:50] there was no
[53:52] holding power
[53:56] when it came down to it like every
[53:58] religious organization
[54:01] when when that man was put into power
[54:06] the power
[54:08] went to his head
[54:11] [Music]
[54:12] and from there he became corrupted
[54:17] he started out right
[54:21] he wanted to do the right thing
[54:23] brother branham says many times he said
[54:25] that that nun she didn't join the
[54:26] catholic church to be a bad person
[54:30] she did it to serve god
[54:32] you know many many people you know we
[54:35] especially today in this age we look
[54:36] around we see people falling by the
[54:38] wayside all over the place whether it's
[54:41] friends people we knew uh ministers that
[54:44] were were pillars
[54:46] in this message
[54:47] falling to the wayside
[54:49] and you go wow how did that happen
[54:53] they seemed to be
[54:55] seemed like nothing ever shook them
[54:57] seemed like they were so on fire all the
[54:59] time
[55:01] they made it this far
[55:05] they made it this far
[55:08] but when the time of shaking came
[55:12] they found all they had was knowledge
[55:15] they had a lot of knowledge
[55:17] and and with their processing power
[55:21] they could reason it
[55:22] themself into
[55:25] believing it
[55:27] and because they
[55:30] are doing it then they're going to go
[55:32] out and convince as many people as they
[55:33] can
[55:34] that it's the truth
[55:37] and it looks like the real thing
[55:39] it looks identical
[55:42] but when
[55:43] when when the rubber meets the road as
[55:45] they say
[55:47] the tires fell off
[55:50] because there was no holding power
[55:53] because it was all of their own
[55:54] reasoning
[55:56] they'd reason themselves out of it
[55:58] and
[55:59] no matter how long it took
[56:01] somebody then reasoned them out of it
[56:04] maybe they reasoned themselves out of it
[56:12] and now
[56:18] i have found david the son of jesse
[56:20] and when he had removed him now
[56:23] this is important
[56:25] you see
[56:26] and it says and when he had removed him
[56:29] who is that he
[56:31] the people didn't remove saul
[56:34] as being king
[56:36] this is going to be this is very key
[56:42] because this is the difference between
[56:43] works
[56:44] and faith
[56:49] is that
[56:50] even as we move into faith
[56:53] we still think there's something we can
[56:55] do to help it
[56:57] still think well
[57:00] maybe if i just do this or if i just do
[57:03] that or if i just stop doing this or if
[57:05] i can stop doing this then i can have
[57:07] the faith for this other
[57:10] as long as you put a contingency on
[57:13] faith that is contingent upon your own
[57:15] human ability of any kind it'll never
[57:17] work
[57:18] it'll always fall short
[57:21] because
[57:22] you know they say that the destruct a
[57:25] chain's strongest is only strongest at
[57:28] its weakest link
[57:30] so it doesn't matter how much of god's
[57:32] perfect faith you put on either side of
[57:34] it i mean you insert a human link in the
[57:36] middle and you give a little tug
[57:40] shatters
[57:41] pulls apart
[57:42] and then you're going
[57:44] what happened
[57:45] i thought i did the right thing i was
[57:47] praying and i was
[57:49] doing this and i was doing that and i
[57:51] was i was doing this other and i was
[57:53] trying my best to live right and i was i
[57:56] was checking all the boxes
[57:59] see the problem is is you tried to check
[58:01] boxes
[58:03] and then put faith on the bottom
[58:06] you try to put your belief under that
[58:08] well if i can check all these boxes
[58:11] off
[58:13] then then once i know i can do that then
[58:16] i know i can have faith
[58:19] you see you're still trying to work
[58:21] something out
[58:23] you know you think you're not because
[58:25] you're not you're not
[58:26] in some dark room with a whip and and
[58:29] praying and beating yourself
[58:32] thinking that somehow that'll bring god
[58:34] pleasure
[58:36] or somehow pleasing and seeing how
[58:38] you're suffering
[58:39] you see that's where
[58:41] the the denominations and the
[58:44] church got it wrong
[58:45] and even the jewish church
[58:48] is they assumed that god took pleasure
[58:52] in their suffering
[58:56] somehow that that was some benefit to
[58:59] god
[59:02] and so if they did enough of it
[59:05] then god would hear their prayers
[59:08] but that's the same spirit of baal
[59:13] because remember that time when elisha
[59:15] was there with the
[59:17] 400 prophets of baal
[59:21] you see
[59:23] god told him
[59:26] bring the sacrifice
[59:28] bring the stones
[59:30] bring the water dig the ditch
[59:33] get ready
[59:36] prepare yourself
[59:39] to meet with me
[59:43] and once he did all of that he just
[59:46] stepped back and said lord i'm yours
[59:50] i've done all that you've requested
[59:53] now i'm done
[59:56] and the prophets of baal they had
[59:58] everything that he had they had the
[1:00:00] sacrifice they had the stones they had
[1:00:02] the altar
[1:00:04] i don't think they poured any water on
[1:00:05] their sacrifice
[1:00:06] because their belief level was much
[1:00:12] less and their god didn't answer
[1:00:18] and immediately you see what they go
[1:00:20] into
[1:00:22] is they begin beating themselves
[1:00:24] and whipping themselves
[1:00:26] it's a pagan
[1:00:28] thing
[1:00:29] it is a thing that goes it's
[1:00:32] of
[1:00:34] the devil all the way back from the
[1:00:36] beginning
[1:00:39] is the mutilation of the people thinking
[1:00:42] that it will bring god some type of
[1:00:45] of
[1:00:46] glory
[1:00:48] to tear themselves down to destroy
[1:00:50] themselves
[1:00:54] and i should just let them run around
[1:00:56] and run around until they were worn out
[1:00:59] they had run themselves out of works
[1:01:03] right
[1:01:05] that was the extreme
[1:01:07] but that's the same thing you're doing
[1:01:08] every time that you think that you can
[1:01:10] work your way into salvation
[1:01:13] you're just running around in a circle
[1:01:17] and and you're you're not even
[1:01:19] reaching out to god
[1:01:23] because he never asked that of you
[1:01:26] he doesn't even know what you're doing
[1:01:28] he's watching you just
[1:01:30] run around in circles and do all these
[1:01:32] works and and well if i do this i know
[1:01:35] scripture says if i put god first then
[1:01:38] he'll do this for me
[1:01:42] you see that's backwards already
[1:01:46] is he said put me first and all these
[1:01:49] things will be added unto
[1:01:50] you but your thinking isn't on christ
[1:01:54] your thinking is
[1:01:55] on
[1:01:56] the reward
[1:01:59] and the minute you put the reward first
[1:02:01] you're already backwards
[1:02:04] you're already backwards
[1:02:07] you see
[1:02:09] is creating some type of contingency
[1:02:11] plan
[1:02:12] around
[1:02:13] faith
[1:02:15] is not faith
[1:02:17] and that's what you're doing you're like
[1:02:19] okay so
[1:02:22] if i
[1:02:23] help the church here and i real
[1:02:25] supportive over here and i go help this
[1:02:28] other person
[1:02:30] um
[1:02:31] with their yard or i help them in some
[1:02:34] financial way or if i'm
[1:02:37] if i pray more
[1:02:40] then god will bless me
[1:02:43] well
[1:02:44] even in that all of those things have
[1:02:46] now become works
[1:02:49] because you've got the cart before the
[1:02:51] horse as they say
[1:02:53] is you're putting all the things
[1:02:56] that should be pulled by the power of
[1:02:59] the horse
[1:03:00] in front of the horse and your cart's
[1:03:03] not going nowhere
[1:03:07] all right and when he had removed him
[1:03:10] he raised up unto them david to be their
[1:03:13] king
[1:03:14] to whom also he gave testimony and said
[1:03:16] i have found david the son of jesse a
[1:03:19] man after my own heart which shall
[1:03:22] fulfill
[1:03:23] all
[1:03:24] my will
[1:03:26] now
[1:03:28] here it is
[1:03:30] the people have had judges
[1:03:32] they've had prophets
[1:03:34] they've had their own king
[1:03:36] they've had it their way
[1:03:38] and their own king has brought them to a
[1:03:40] point where they're in chaos
[1:03:44] it looked good starting out
[1:03:46] and now he's running around
[1:03:48] destroying the church
[1:03:51] you know i i personally
[1:03:54] can give testimony to that's how these
[1:03:56] churches work
[1:03:59] i grew up in a
[1:04:00] place that was just like that
[1:04:05] it looked great
[1:04:07] it looked perfect
[1:04:09] the people who started it
[1:04:11] they were there for they were all there
[1:04:13] for the right reason
[1:04:15] but their focus came off of christ
[1:04:18] and little by lit little it went from
[1:04:21] christ
[1:04:22] to the pastor
[1:04:25] and the pastor became the absolute of
[1:04:27] the church
[1:04:30] and instead of remaining humble and
[1:04:32] pointing the people to christ
[1:04:36] the power the prestige the money that
[1:04:38] came along with it
[1:04:40] took over
[1:04:43] because there was a knowledge of the
[1:04:45] truth
[1:04:47] but not a belief
[1:04:53] you see and as it begins going that way
[1:04:56] because they don't believe
[1:04:59] then they don't believe anyone else
[1:05:00] believes
[1:05:01] and because what they thought they
[1:05:04] believed wasn't good enough for them
[1:05:06] you see because they're still struggling
[1:05:08] with all these things in their past
[1:05:10] they're even struggling as as as you
[1:05:13] know like saul here it didn't happen
[1:05:15] overnight he didn't go from being
[1:05:17] anointed king
[1:05:18] to the next day killing the prophets of
[1:05:20] the lord
[1:05:23] it was a period it was a time
[1:05:27] different things began to happen
[1:05:29] where he felt rejected like he felt
[1:05:31] spurned
[1:05:33] like if i can't be number one all the
[1:05:35] time
[1:05:37] it's not good enough
[1:05:40] it's like samuel told him they were
[1:05:43] going to battle and tanya told him come
[1:05:45] to this certain location and we're gonna
[1:05:47] before battle we're going to
[1:05:50] present a sacrifice unto the lord
[1:05:54] and
[1:05:55] saul gathered the people
[1:05:57] he got to the right location
[1:05:59] he got to church
[1:06:01] and he had the right sacrifice he was
[1:06:03] ready
[1:06:04] he was antsy he was ready to go
[1:06:07] and samuel didn't show up
[1:06:10] on his schedule
[1:06:12] he didn't show up
[1:06:14] he waited
[1:06:15] and he waited
[1:06:18] and saul said we can't wait no more
[1:06:21] if we wait any longer the enemy will get
[1:06:23] away
[1:06:24] you see
[1:06:25] there it is doubt
[1:06:28] samuel already told him we're going to
[1:06:30] go we're going to fight we're gonna
[1:06:31] we're gonna go before the lord for
[1:06:33] victory and battle
[1:06:35] and
[1:06:36] then we're going to war
[1:06:38] and we will win
[1:06:42] but he didn't believe
[1:06:44] that was true if it didn't happen
[1:06:47] fast enough for him
[1:06:50] there was doubt there
[1:06:52] he said i have to do this myself
[1:06:56] or else it's not going to work
[1:06:59] and he did
[1:07:00] he went and he
[1:07:02] out of his position
[1:07:05] went to present the sacrifice
[1:07:07] and moments after he finished samuel
[1:07:09] shows up
[1:07:13] now you say wow
[1:07:14] god must have
[1:07:16] really done a number and and
[1:07:19] they still won
[1:07:22] but god wasn't pleased it was from that
[1:07:24] time forward
[1:07:26] that he began working with samuel and he
[1:07:28] said we're going to find someone else
[1:07:33] other than this man
[1:07:35] but you know he was in power for years
[1:07:37] and years after that
[1:07:39] to the people it looked like god was
[1:07:41] still blessing him
[1:07:43] tremendously financially in battle
[1:07:47] next thing happens is god begins moving
[1:07:49] on a young man's heart
[1:07:51] that he's moving on the scene for
[1:07:53] because he's going to be the one god's
[1:07:54] going to use to
[1:07:56] save his people
[1:08:00] and that young man
[1:08:02] gets moved into a position
[1:08:03] right next to saul and saul doesn't even
[1:08:05] realize it
[1:08:07] saul as a person doesn't realize it but
[1:08:10] that spirit that's already afflicted him
[1:08:12] does
[1:08:14] it's a jealous spirit
[1:08:17] it's an impatient spirit
[1:08:22] and now it begins to work on him and
[1:08:26] work on him and it's happening so slowly
[1:08:28] that the people of the congregation
[1:08:30] the men of his
[1:08:32] military might the men and generals of
[1:08:34] his army that are standing close next to
[1:08:36] him they don't even know he's changing
[1:08:40] all they know is wow look at saul
[1:08:43] man what a great king remember remember
[1:08:45] what it was like when we only had judges
[1:08:47] and we always the people around us
[1:08:49] always pushed us around wow not with
[1:08:51] saul here he's the best
[1:08:56] but it's the same nicolette in spirit
[1:08:59] it's taking over
[1:09:01] and
[1:09:02] it's kind of like
[1:09:04] you know the term they say those
[1:09:07] who have been abused
[1:09:08] are most likely to abuse
[1:09:14] and that's where
[1:09:16] many of us need to check ourselves and
[1:09:19] say lord deliver me
[1:09:22] because
[1:09:24] we we run from the grips of slavery
[1:09:27] to run and enslave somebody else
[1:09:31] because we're still under this saul
[1:09:33] influence
[1:09:34] we're still under the influence of the
[1:09:36] law
[1:09:38] we think we're so revelated
[1:09:42] but we do the same thing like the man
[1:09:43] who was forgiven
[1:09:45] 500
[1:09:46] talents and he walks straight out of
[1:09:49] there
[1:09:50] feeling great
[1:09:53] and finds the man who owns him owes him
[1:09:56] 50
[1:09:57] and throws him in jail
[1:10:00] how often do we do the same
[1:10:03] to brothers and sisters in christ
[1:10:05] and i'm not talking about a monetary
[1:10:07] value
[1:10:08] but we are forgiven so much
[1:10:14] we are forgiven all not just all in your
[1:10:17] past
[1:10:18] but all in your past
[1:10:20] all in your current
[1:10:21] all in your future
[1:10:23] it's forgiven
[1:10:26] if you believe it
[1:10:29] and then we turn around as soon as we we
[1:10:31] feel a little bit better about ourselves
[1:10:33] just like him that the relief of the
[1:10:35] debt was off of him
[1:10:39] all right
[1:10:40] oh my goodness
[1:10:42] look at what that guy's doing
[1:10:44] man
[1:10:46] and he calls himself a christian
[1:10:51] in a moment like
[1:10:54] we step out the door
[1:10:55] right out the door we've just been in a
[1:10:57] service where god's been moving on your
[1:10:59] heart and you were you had felt
[1:11:01] condemned coming in
[1:11:03] because we're human we're people
[1:11:06] paul said he said that which i would not
[1:11:08] that i do and that which i would i do
[1:11:11] not he said in this body of flesh i'm
[1:11:14] going to fight it till the very end
[1:11:18] so
[1:11:19] yeah
[1:11:20] if the if the holy spirit is moving in
[1:11:22] your life
[1:11:24] and you do something you shouldn't
[1:11:26] you're going to feel condemned
[1:11:27] now he's not going to keep you there
[1:11:29] see that's going to be a major
[1:11:31] difference between these two places
[1:11:35] where this under the the
[1:11:37] influence of of
[1:11:39] the king the ma men the people chose the
[1:11:43] people's men versus god's men
[1:11:48] teaching and knowledge of man versus
[1:11:51] teaching and revelation of the holy
[1:11:53] spirit
[1:11:56] a key thing
[1:11:59] you're going to find
[1:12:02] is that one
[1:12:06] forgives
[1:12:09] and the other one
[1:12:11] is looking for someone
[1:12:14] else
[1:12:15] to blame
[1:12:18] you know
[1:12:20] growing up
[1:12:27] i was born and raised in in the church
[1:12:29] for until i was 18 years old
[1:12:32] and
[1:12:34] i didn't even think about it
[1:12:37] but you know any time
[1:12:40] someone was going through some kind of a
[1:12:42] trial
[1:12:43] that was well known
[1:12:45] or the pastor himself was going through
[1:12:48] some kind of a trial
[1:12:50] someone became really sick in the church
[1:12:56] whatever it was
[1:12:59] it would instantly go from
[1:13:01] a message of
[1:13:04] we all are the only ones we're the only
[1:13:06] ones making it
[1:13:09] we're the only church
[1:13:10] you all are are the bride
[1:13:13] and the next second
[1:13:14] ain't none of you got the holy ghost
[1:13:18] like figure that out
[1:13:20] but it's the same nicolaitan spirit
[1:13:23] it was playing all the way back here
[1:13:28] it keeps moving forward now you see it
[1:13:30] in in the matthew in jesus time
[1:13:34] where they asked him you know
[1:13:36] lord this man he's born blind was that
[1:13:39] for some sin he he he
[1:13:41] was
[1:13:42] committed
[1:13:43] or a sin of his parents or maybe his
[1:13:45] grandparents
[1:13:47] we have to lay the blame to somebody
[1:13:50] someone is at fault
[1:13:53] and jesus said no no no
[1:13:55] nobody's at fault you guys calm
[1:13:58] down it's simply so that i i
[1:14:03] the god of glory can show my glory
[1:14:07] that's it
[1:14:08] that's it
[1:14:10] that trial going through
[1:14:13] that thing you're struggling with
[1:14:15] that sickness you're going through
[1:14:17] it ain't nobody's fault
[1:14:19] we don't need to find the scapegoat to
[1:14:21] pin it to
[1:14:24] there already was a scapegoat back at
[1:14:26] calvary
[1:14:28] he took it all upon himself
[1:14:32] you see
[1:14:34] but if we find ourselves in a place
[1:14:40] where we're lacking in the right
[1:14:42] revelation of the word
[1:14:44] right
[1:14:45] oh many of us
[1:14:47] speaking from personal experience
[1:14:50] raised up in the message
[1:14:52] went to sunday school from the time i
[1:14:53] was four or five years old
[1:14:56] you know by it by the last you the last
[1:15:00] sunday school um when you're
[1:15:02] you it was like eight or 12 to 13 the
[1:15:05] last year there they had a brother there
[1:15:07] who would take you through the seven
[1:15:09] church ages and the seven seals bit by
[1:15:12] bit and walk you through the scriptures
[1:15:14] so
[1:15:15] you know it
[1:15:17] you can quote it
[1:15:19] if you can recall it to memory like that
[1:15:22] knowledge
[1:15:23] knowledge
[1:15:25] knowledge is a dangerous thing
[1:15:28] now don't take me wrong i'm not saying
[1:15:30] don't study
[1:15:32] by all means get in the word study
[1:15:38] you're meant to do that
[1:15:41] but it's meant to be combined with the
[1:15:43] teaching of the holy spirit
[1:15:46] not
[1:15:47] with the fear of man
[1:15:50] you see that was the struggle here both
[1:15:52] in isaiah and matthew he says their fear
[1:15:55] toward me
[1:15:58] towards who
[1:15:59] god himself
[1:16:01] the teachers
[1:16:03] were teaching the people of fear towards
[1:16:05] god
[1:16:07] but not in the way that he he he listed
[1:16:10] later it's not the fear of the lord
[1:16:13] a fear out of respect
[1:16:17] a respect of that holy presence that
[1:16:19] just comes down and you feel it and that
[1:16:22] awesome fear brother branham talks about
[1:16:24] it he said you just can't stand in it
[1:16:27] he said not that kind of fear
[1:16:30] but it's the fear
[1:16:31] of a judgment
[1:16:34] a fear of the
[1:16:36] man in the sky with a hammer
[1:16:40] who you have to please
[1:16:43] why why do they teach it that way
[1:16:49] because if they can convince you that's
[1:16:50] what god is
[1:16:52] then they can rule over you the same way
[1:16:57] a teaching of fear
[1:17:00] is used to control the people
[1:17:03] not bring them closer to god
[1:17:07] their fear toward me is taught
[1:17:10] by the precepts of men
[1:17:12] now precepts of men and in matthew it
[1:17:14] says for doctrines the commandments of
[1:17:17] men
[1:17:19] they're using the same bible
[1:17:21] they are quoting the same
[1:17:23] prophets
[1:17:24] they were coding moses
[1:17:26] scripture tells us that while he was
[1:17:29] hanging on the cross
[1:17:31] they are quoting the psalm
[1:17:34] about the crucifixion
[1:17:39] knowledge
[1:17:41] no revelation
[1:17:54] hmm
[1:17:55] i swear a little a note here
[1:17:58] something to keep in mind
[1:18:01] religion puts greater emphasis
[1:18:05] on the keeping of rules and appearance
[1:18:08] than the saving of souls
[1:18:10] and getting people to christ
[1:18:16] you know any one view
[1:18:18] to this day
[1:18:21] although it's become much more closed
[1:18:22] off if you were to walk into the church
[1:18:24] that i grew up in
[1:18:27] being 30 minutes early
[1:18:30] as taught by the prophet
[1:18:32] to come and prepare yourself before
[1:18:34] service
[1:18:36] to be 30 minutes early was to be late
[1:18:42] the music was playing just perfectly way
[1:18:45] before service
[1:18:47] everyone would walk in quietly and sit
[1:18:50] in their place
[1:18:52] you'd go to your place
[1:18:54] and then
[1:18:55] from the smallest children to the oldest
[1:18:58] adult
[1:19:00] as they came into service one at a time
[1:19:02] or as they came trickling into the
[1:19:04] building
[1:19:05] become
[1:19:07] their place set themselves down
[1:19:10] get up go down to the altar for a time
[1:19:12] of prayer
[1:19:13] come back up
[1:19:17] now if you see me around here now
[1:19:18] typically i i'm i'm quite a bit more
[1:19:21] casual typically
[1:19:23] but
[1:19:24] being casual on a wednesday night meant
[1:19:26] that you were at least wearing a shirt
[1:19:28] and tie
[1:19:32] the comments which i didn't even think
[1:19:34] about it back then
[1:19:36] but the comments
[1:19:38] that we would get from other people who
[1:19:40] would come and visit on a sunday
[1:19:43] right
[1:19:44] was it look like everyone was going to
[1:19:46] the prom
[1:19:51] i know of a young man
[1:19:53] who showed up without his suit coat on
[1:19:55] on a sunday and they sent him home to
[1:19:57] get it
[1:20:02] yeah
[1:20:04] but the worship it was perfect
[1:20:07] the the pianist and the organists and
[1:20:08] the and the the music and the band and
[1:20:12] they would all play together and in
[1:20:14] prior to the service starting and come
[1:20:15] up and just everyone would just everyone
[1:20:18] together as one enter into worship and
[1:20:20] singing you wouldn't hardly see a person
[1:20:22] not
[1:20:23] not if they were clapping everyone was
[1:20:24] clapping if they were singing everyone
[1:20:26] was singing
[1:20:28] right
[1:20:29] church order looks perfect
[1:20:32] catholic church got it down to a t
[1:20:35] you come in you're quiet you're reverent
[1:20:38] brother branham even said you
[1:20:40] pentecostals could learn a few things
[1:20:41] from them
[1:20:47] guess we're all awake now
[1:20:50] but
[1:20:51] but they had their church order down
[1:20:54] exactly
[1:20:56] just like the sadducees and pharisees
[1:20:58] and the priests of jesus time
[1:21:01] every robe was exact
[1:21:03] every little tassel was in place
[1:21:06] when you walked you walked a certain way
[1:21:10] when you came into the temple you you
[1:21:11] came in a certain direction
[1:21:14] everything was exact exact jesus said
[1:21:18] except your righteousness be greater
[1:21:20] than that of the righteousness of the
[1:21:23] sadducees and pharisees
[1:21:25] he said you don't even have a chance to
[1:21:28] enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:21:30] and they and the disciples said
[1:21:34] how is anyone going to manage that i
[1:21:36] can't even manage to live as well as
[1:21:37] they do
[1:21:40] he said you cannot put a
[1:21:42] single dot
[1:21:45] to their lives
[1:21:47] when you if you'd put them under a
[1:21:48] microscope and examine how they live
[1:21:52] by way of works
[1:21:54] you won't find a thing
[1:21:57] they have it exact
[1:22:00] and jesus said
[1:22:02] lest your righteousness is greater than
[1:22:04] that
[1:22:05] you don't even have a chance
[1:22:08] and the disciples are still thinking
[1:22:09] with that old mentality the works
[1:22:11] mentality
[1:22:13] they're like wow
[1:22:15] if that's the level i got to go to
[1:22:18] i'm not going to make it not because i
[1:22:19] don't want to
[1:22:20] but i know myself way too well
[1:22:24] i'm not going to make it
[1:22:26] but jesus was not
[1:22:28] talking about
[1:22:29] your own righteousness
[1:22:32] you see he was working them out of that
[1:22:35] he was getting them out because it
[1:22:37] wasn't going to be
[1:22:39] another saul
[1:22:41] it was not going to be another
[1:22:44] man's leadership or man's counsel or
[1:22:46] man's commandments
[1:22:50] but he was calling them up
[1:22:54] because it was going to be he himself
[1:22:57] it wasn't going to be your righteousness
[1:22:59] it was going to be his righteousness
[1:23:02] it wasn't going to be your works it was
[1:23:04] going to be his works
[1:23:06] why because you're going to be living by
[1:23:09] faith
[1:23:11] and what faith the faith of the son of
[1:23:13] man
[1:23:15] you see we think well i have faith for
[1:23:17] that or i have faith for this or i my
[1:23:19] faith
[1:23:21] it's not that's not really true
[1:23:24] he the lord allows us to say those
[1:23:26] things
[1:23:30] but it's his faith
[1:23:32] you don't have
[1:23:34] any faith outside of his faith
[1:23:37] you're not able to believe outside of
[1:23:39] what he's revealed to you
[1:23:42] so you have a revelation that he's given
[1:23:44] you
[1:23:45] you have a faith to believe that
[1:23:46] revelation that he's given you
[1:23:49] you see this is why there's such a
[1:23:51] difference between those who have
[1:23:53] knowledge
[1:23:55] and those who it's revealed to
[1:23:57] those who believe
[1:24:00] not just those who have knowledge
[1:24:02] because when you begin to realize the
[1:24:04] difference
[1:24:06] you see whenever you have a lot of
[1:24:07] knowledge let's say you're a doctor or
[1:24:09] you're a lawyer or
[1:24:12] whatever it is you're the specialist in
[1:24:14] what you do
[1:24:15] right
[1:24:16] and you have studied and you have worked
[1:24:20] and you have gone under apprenticeship
[1:24:22] you've gone through internship you have
[1:24:25] gone through whatever you need to do
[1:24:28] to be the top of your field
[1:24:32] when someone
[1:24:34] comes and says anything
[1:24:36] contrary to what you know
[1:24:40] and you know that
[1:24:42] they they don't have any qualifications
[1:24:46] they read something on google
[1:24:49] right
[1:24:50] on something that takes
[1:24:52] a lifetime to master but at least years
[1:24:55] and years to know enough to even be able
[1:24:57] to discern between what is one thing and
[1:25:00] another
[1:25:02] it becomes a personal affront
[1:25:05] to you
[1:25:07] look at all the work i put into this
[1:25:10] and you're trying to tell me
[1:25:12] that i don't know what i'm talking about
[1:25:14] how dare you
[1:25:19] right
[1:25:20] and that's the place of works in
[1:25:23] religion
[1:25:26] is do you know how long i've been in
[1:25:28] this message
[1:25:30] do you know how many messages i've heard
[1:25:33] do you know how many messages i've read
[1:25:35] do you know how many messages how many
[1:25:37] quotes i have memorized
[1:25:39] do you know how much of the scripture i
[1:25:41] can quote to you by memory
[1:25:43] me not hardly any i have a horrible
[1:25:45] memory
[1:25:47] so that that's something i had a
[1:25:49] struggle with
[1:25:54] but when it's that and someone dares to
[1:25:57] contradict it
[1:25:59] what you think
[1:26:00] and what you think you know
[1:26:03] it's now personal between me and you
[1:26:08] i'm going to get you
[1:26:10] i'm going to prove to you
[1:26:12] one way or the other
[1:26:14] and the catholic church did just that
[1:26:16] all through the inquisition
[1:26:19] if i can't convince you with words i'll
[1:26:22] beat it out of you
[1:26:25] because if i lose
[1:26:27] i lose everything
[1:26:30] and i don't have that much confidence in
[1:26:32] what i know
[1:26:36] you see
[1:26:37] that's why we should never ever
[1:26:40] be afraid to have our faith challenged
[1:26:45] don't fear it
[1:26:46] don't fear it
[1:26:49] you know the only reason why you fear
[1:26:51] or someone would fear to have their
[1:26:52] faith challenged
[1:26:54] they're not sure what they really
[1:26:55] believe
[1:26:58] they're standing in a place of knowledge
[1:27:00] but they're not sure themselves
[1:27:02] and so imagine this
[1:27:05] you're in the middle of a storm
[1:27:07] and you're on an island
[1:27:09] it's a very small island and you're
[1:27:11] balanced on what you believe is the only
[1:27:13] firm ground that's keeping you out of
[1:27:14] the rushing water
[1:27:18] and
[1:27:20] someone else starts taking
[1:27:22] pot shots
[1:27:24] at the ground underneath your
[1:27:26] firm ground
[1:27:28] now
[1:27:29] if you know that's a granite fortress of
[1:27:32] a rock
[1:27:34] you're not worried about
[1:27:36] what they throw at it
[1:27:38] you'll stand there you'll lay there
[1:27:40] you'll sleep there
[1:27:42] you'll dance there
[1:27:45] it doesn't matter
[1:27:47] it's like the rock of gibraltar
[1:27:50] you know
[1:27:52] that the amount of force
[1:27:54] it would take to dislodge you is
[1:27:56] impossible
[1:27:59] so you're unconcerned
[1:28:02] but if you think
[1:28:04] that the top that you're standing on is
[1:28:05] just a thin amount of rock
[1:28:08] and everything under that is sand
[1:28:10] every time anybody throws anything
[1:28:13] at the base
[1:28:15] you're going to be really upset
[1:28:18] and you know why you're upset because
[1:28:20] you are really afraid
[1:28:23] there's no need to be afraid
[1:28:26] if you believe
[1:28:30] so the only thing that challenging your
[1:28:32] faith does
[1:28:34] is it shakes you up a bit
[1:28:36] it shakes you up
[1:28:39] just like a tree with the wind blowing
[1:28:40] through its branches
[1:28:43] it'll figure out what your roots are
[1:28:44] made out of
[1:28:46] is it made out of knowledge because so
[1:28:48] you have reason to be afraid
[1:28:51] because knowledge is just a whole lot of
[1:28:54] reasoning
[1:28:56] and if it's just reasoning someone will
[1:28:58] reason better than you
[1:29:00] there's someone smarter than you that'll
[1:29:02] reason you in a circle so big that you
[1:29:04] can't find the other end
[1:29:06] and you'll just go into a tailspin and
[1:29:07] away you'll be and gone
[1:29:11] but if you have a revelation
[1:29:13] that's true then all it's going to do is
[1:29:16] the wind blows through your branches
[1:29:19] it's going to shake
[1:29:21] it's going to
[1:29:22] the tree is going to bend a little bit
[1:29:24] back and forth it's going to flex with
[1:29:26] the wind
[1:29:28] and it's going to take and all the way
[1:29:30] down the ground it's going to loosen
[1:29:31] things up
[1:29:33] and all those roots are going to kind of
[1:29:34] pull in the earth
[1:29:36] you know all that does
[1:29:38] it just makes it easier for them to grow
[1:29:40] again next time
[1:29:42] they just reach out further why because
[1:29:43] it loosens the ground around them
[1:29:46] and they just reach out further and
[1:29:48] further and dig in deeper
[1:29:50] and that's what we want
[1:29:52] we want people to challenge our faith
[1:29:54] we want to be challenged in a way that
[1:29:56] shakes us up from what we're just
[1:29:58] hanging around in
[1:29:59] you want someone to ask us a question we
[1:30:01] don't know the answer to
[1:30:04] why because we know the one who has the
[1:30:06] answers
[1:30:08] and sometimes when we're just drifting
[1:30:10] along and we're happy with where we're
[1:30:12] at in life and we're happy with the way
[1:30:14] the lord is blessing us and you know we
[1:30:16] get complacent
[1:30:19] and we need a little bit of wind to
[1:30:21] shake us up
[1:30:23] why
[1:30:24] then remember oh yeah i should be
[1:30:25] reading my bible more often
[1:30:27] wow
[1:30:28] and someone will ask you a question
[1:30:29] you're like wow i never even thought
[1:30:31] about that
[1:30:33] but tell you what
[1:30:35] give me a little bit of time and i'll
[1:30:36] get you an answer
[1:30:38] i'm going to go back to the one who has
[1:30:40] the answers
[1:30:41] and ask him
[1:30:42] and he'll tell me
[1:30:44] because he said in the scripture that he
[1:30:46] would send the comforter who would teach
[1:30:49] us all things
[1:30:51] didn't say you would know all things at
[1:30:52] once he said he's going to teach you all
[1:30:54] things
[1:30:56] but like any good professor
[1:30:59] he's going to you're going to be
[1:31:00] learning the main part of the curriculum
[1:31:02] and it's the students that take a deeper
[1:31:05] interest
[1:31:06] that he'll take to the side and explain
[1:31:08] it to you
[1:31:09] that's all he's waiting for you to do
[1:31:11] is you come here every service you know
[1:31:14] you get the base curriculum don't for a
[1:31:16] minute think that this is all you need
[1:31:19] this is just meant to be another part of
[1:31:21] the shake you up a little bit
[1:31:24] taken and and maybe something that
[1:31:26] you've never heard before you never
[1:31:28] heard it that way before will come and
[1:31:30] at you and you go huh
[1:31:32] never heard that before
[1:31:35] now
[1:31:36] i tell you this don't just take it for
[1:31:38] gospel truth
[1:31:40] don't do it
[1:31:42] even if it is
[1:31:44] right
[1:31:46] the prophet told us not to do that
[1:31:48] and that was with him ministering with
[1:31:51] thus saith the lord
[1:31:53] he said you owe it to yourself
[1:31:55] to go back to the scriptures
[1:31:57] and ask the lord to reveal it to you
[1:32:01] because if all you do is receive it here
[1:32:03] and go yeah well brother so-and-so is
[1:32:05] the one who said it must be true
[1:32:08] you got a nugget of knowledge
[1:32:11] but until it becomes a revelation
[1:32:14] it's not going to take hold
[1:32:16] you see because
[1:32:19] the word to believe let's jump back to
[1:32:21] that real quick
[1:32:22] same as as faith amman which is where we
[1:32:26] get the word amen
[1:32:30] which
[1:32:31] belief
[1:32:32] and faith are always coincide with an
[1:32:35] action
[1:32:38] you see that's the other difference
[1:32:39] between knowledge and belief
[1:32:42] is that the hebrew word was so deep in
[1:32:45] meaning
[1:32:47] is
[1:32:49] to know something
[1:32:51] may not change anything for
[1:32:52] you we could find something out about a
[1:32:55] country halfway around the world how
[1:32:56] they're starving to death
[1:32:58] and we're all going to lunch to this
[1:33:00] evening we're not even going to think
[1:33:02] about it
[1:33:03] we're not even going to pause
[1:33:06] like we'll feel bad for a moment but
[1:33:08] because it's so far away and most of us
[1:33:10] have never experienced that
[1:33:12] we'll feel bad oh that's
[1:33:14] we'll pray for them
[1:33:16] and we'll pray for them as we pray for
[1:33:17] our lunch
[1:33:22] so we have a knowledge
[1:33:23] but the likelihood that you're going to
[1:33:25] look into ways to send aid and you're
[1:33:28] going to look into ways to be of help to
[1:33:30] that
[1:33:32] problem halfway around the world
[1:33:34] pretty slim i would imagine for most of
[1:33:36] us
[1:33:37] there's just too many problems in the
[1:33:38] world
[1:33:42] knowledge
[1:33:44] but belief is different
[1:33:47] belief is something to say you believe
[1:33:51] will always bring about an action
[1:33:53] a belief will always cause a change in
[1:33:56] your life
[1:33:59] it is actionable and it takes effect
[1:34:04] it has fruit
[1:34:06] that's why here
[1:34:07] in isaiah
[1:34:10] nope
[1:34:15] hold on
[1:34:40] it bringeth forth fruit
[1:34:55] oh yeah
[1:34:56] if we can go back to romans 7.
[1:35:00] you bring that up for me
[1:35:08] verse five
[1:35:13] for when we were in the flesh the
[1:35:15] motions of sin which were by the law did
[1:35:16] work on our members to bring forth fruit
[1:35:20] unto death
[1:35:22] okay
[1:35:23] so
[1:35:24] no matter which one that you're
[1:35:25] partaking of
[1:35:27] you could be partaking of the tree of
[1:35:29] the knowledge of good and evil
[1:35:33] you see the problem with the tree
[1:35:36] wasn't that it was all evil
[1:35:38] it was just knowledge
[1:35:42] it was just knowledge
[1:35:44] of good and evil
[1:35:48] it was both
[1:35:50] it was information
[1:35:52] it's what we have today
[1:35:53] you know that's what daniel said in the
[1:35:55] book of daniel there uh they think it
[1:35:57] was daniel 12
[1:35:58] chapter 12 verse 4.
[1:36:01] it said that knowledge would be
[1:36:02] increased
[1:36:04] and many would run to and fro
[1:36:08] more knowledge more confusion
[1:36:17] but the fruit of revelation is not the
[1:36:19] same
[1:36:20] it's a fruit of life
[1:36:46] josh if you have a spoken word as the
[1:36:49] original seed
[1:36:51] if you're going off the power point it's
[1:36:53] slide 14
[1:36:56] and it says
[1:36:59] a seed must have water to grow
[1:37:02] now you put a seed in the ground if
[1:37:03] there's no moisture in the ground it's
[1:37:05] dust and it won't grow in the dust
[1:37:08] can't
[1:37:09] it got to have a certain percent of
[1:37:10] moisture or won't grow that's right the
[1:37:13] letter killeth the spirit giveth it life
[1:37:18] and jumping down um
[1:37:20] in paragraph 116
[1:37:23] without the water when the he first con
[1:37:26] when he's first converted he looks right
[1:37:28] straight to christ he believes and the
[1:37:30] first thing you know that denomination
[1:37:32] binds him up into a place and the
[1:37:34] moisture the spirit is god
[1:37:36] gone from him
[1:37:38] he becomes denominational and he's dead
[1:37:43] you see
[1:37:44] the word
[1:37:46] is correct
[1:37:48] the letter of the word is correct
[1:37:51] and it's good
[1:37:53] and it's true
[1:37:55] but without a revelation
[1:37:58] it just brings death
[1:38:00] it brings more death
[1:38:02] you see because
[1:38:05] as we begin to
[1:38:07] understand
[1:38:09] or begin to read
[1:38:10] and acquire knowledge
[1:38:13] then
[1:38:14] the devil uses that against us
[1:38:17] he does the same thing as he did with
[1:38:19] christ
[1:38:21] and he came to him there in the desert
[1:38:24] and he began quoting the scripture
[1:38:28] you see the difference there is christ
[1:38:30] had a revelation of who he was
[1:38:33] and he could quote not just quote the
[1:38:36] scripture back
[1:38:38] but it was the scripture that was
[1:38:39] applicable to himself
[1:38:43] like in there when he said he took him
[1:38:45] to the says he took him to the pinnacle
[1:38:47] of the temple
[1:38:49] and he quoted him the scripture and he
[1:38:51] said it says
[1:38:53] that if you were to cast yourself down
[1:38:57] you would not even
[1:38:59] stub your toe upon a stone
[1:39:01] and that's paraphrasing so don't look
[1:39:03] for that in the king james
[1:39:06] and jesus said
[1:39:08] it also is written
[1:39:10] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[1:39:15] now when you first read that you think
[1:39:16] jesus is referring and said i
[1:39:20] am not going to tempt god
[1:39:22] by throwing myself down
[1:39:26] but when you read it
[1:39:27] and you get into the message
[1:39:30] you realize
[1:39:32] he was telling satan
[1:39:34] you should not tempt god
[1:39:37] he said because i
[1:39:40] am the embodiment of god in flesh
[1:39:47] you will reap
[1:39:49] from this
[1:39:53] you see that's the difference between
[1:39:54] knowledge and a revelation
[1:39:57] one we look at it we go like oh yeah i
[1:39:59] shouldn't tempt god so
[1:40:01] wow i've been
[1:40:04] that
[1:40:05] lustful spirit i've been dealing with
[1:40:06] that i better not do that because it'll
[1:40:08] tempt god this other thing that i've
[1:40:10] been doing this music i've been
[1:40:12] listening to i better not listen to it
[1:40:13] because it's gonna
[1:40:15] tempt god
[1:40:18] this whatever the action is insert
[1:40:20] whatever it is that you struggle with
[1:40:23] i better not do that
[1:40:25] because it'll tempt god
[1:40:28] but jesus knew who he was
[1:40:32] and he spoke to the devil he spoke to
[1:40:34] that problem and said how dare you
[1:40:37] tempt me
[1:40:40] scripture specifically tells you not to
[1:40:43] because i identify with the father
[1:40:45] amen
[1:40:49] you see and that's where
[1:40:50] many of us find ourselves and we don't
[1:40:53] think about it but we're still trying to
[1:40:54] perform some type of work to deliver
[1:40:56] ourself
[1:40:58] from that thing that we're struggling
[1:41:00] with or your pride your anger whatever
[1:41:02] it is and wow if i can just you know
[1:41:05] these 12 steps
[1:41:07] to not being angry
[1:41:09] 12 steps to not being an alcoholic
[1:41:12] we know all those programs including
[1:41:14] alcoholics and anonymous when you get to
[1:41:16] the very end of your program
[1:41:19] you say
[1:41:20] you start out with i am an alcoholic and
[1:41:23] you end with i am an alcoholic
[1:41:26] you've not been delivered
[1:41:28] you've just learned steps that maybe
[1:41:31] will help you avoid it
[1:41:35] and we think that we can approach god in
[1:41:37] that way
[1:41:38] if we just apply these 12 steps
[1:41:41] to getting rid of my problem
[1:41:44] then i can have a closer walk with god
[1:41:48] and god is saying just come have a
[1:41:50] closer walk with me
[1:41:52] and you won't have to worry about it
[1:41:57] you know i think even many times that's
[1:41:59] what we do is maybe we're trying to
[1:42:01] counsel someone or give someone advice
[1:42:03] and what do i what do i do about this
[1:42:05] and well have you tried this and have
[1:42:06] you tried that and well maybe just don't
[1:42:09] hang out with those people and don't
[1:42:12] don't keep don't keep those types of
[1:42:13] things around you
[1:42:15] and i'm not saying that's bad advice
[1:42:19] but i know
[1:42:20] from personal experience
[1:42:22] one minute you're heavily convicted and
[1:42:24] you take whatever it is and you destroy
[1:42:26] it or you throw it away or you get rid
[1:42:28] of it or you
[1:42:31] you say i'm never going to do that again
[1:42:35] i feel better
[1:42:37] all right
[1:42:38] i'm ready to go to church now
[1:42:41] i can stand up tall and and know i'm i'm
[1:42:44] here and i can be accepted and i belong
[1:42:46] here because i'm doing the right thing
[1:42:49] and you do and then a few days later a
[1:42:51] week later a month later
[1:42:54] you
[1:42:55] go back and you rebuy it
[1:42:58] you re-hang out with those people
[1:43:00] you
[1:43:01] you go right back
[1:43:03] why
[1:43:04] because the desire was never taken from
[1:43:07] you
[1:43:08] and you cannot deliver yourself of a
[1:43:10] desire
[1:43:12] that was the problem with the children
[1:43:13] of israel wandering around the
[1:43:15] wilderness
[1:43:16] dealing with works
[1:43:18] i bring my my lamb i bring my dove i
[1:43:21] offer it up i feel better they tell me
[1:43:23] go sin no more
[1:43:25] i walk away i feel good about myself
[1:43:28] and i still have the same desire and i
[1:43:30] go do the same thing and then the next
[1:43:32] day i come back i present the same
[1:43:34] sacrifice and i do it all over again and
[1:43:37] over again and over again and over again
[1:43:42] and then we start looking for fault and
[1:43:44] then we start even within ourselves wow
[1:43:46] maybe i'm maybe i'm just not a son a god
[1:43:49] hey i'm not maybe maybe i don't belong
[1:43:51] here
[1:43:52] look at this
[1:43:53] i keep trying and trying and trying and
[1:43:56] trying
[1:43:58] and it doesn't work well stop trying
[1:44:03] stop trying
[1:44:05] that's your problem
[1:44:07] your problem is you're trying
[1:44:10] he never wanted you to do that
[1:44:13] he said lay your burdens on me
[1:44:18] he didn't say keep carrying your burden
[1:44:21] how many of you have read pilgrim's
[1:44:22] progress a few maybe maybe you know the
[1:44:24] story basically right
[1:44:27] the man he's he he has a heavy load of
[1:44:30] sin
[1:44:31] and it's in the shape of a heavy burden
[1:44:34] on his back
[1:44:36] right
[1:44:38] and he tries all these things to get rid
[1:44:41] of it
[1:44:44] and in the end you know how he got rid
[1:44:45] of
[1:44:46] it he walked to the foot of the cross
[1:44:50] and kneeled at the foot of the cross
[1:44:53] and as he kneeled at the foot of the
[1:44:55] cross
[1:44:58] the burden rolled away
[1:45:00] he didn't take it off
[1:45:02] he didn't lay it down
[1:45:04] it rolled away
[1:45:08] you see
[1:45:09] but as long as you're trying to remove
[1:45:11] it
[1:45:13] it'll stay there
[1:45:15] it'll stay there it may be reduced it
[1:45:17] may be smaller
[1:45:19] because that's why when
[1:45:22] all right i'm
[1:45:24] watching the clock here so i'm gonna
[1:45:25] give myself about five to ten minutes
[1:45:27] and try and wrap it up
[1:45:29] but that's why
[1:45:31] when
[1:45:32] they brought the woman accused of
[1:45:34] adultery before jesus
[1:45:41] they said we got this guy
[1:45:42] now here he is
[1:45:45] he's he he always tries to play mr nice
[1:45:47] guy forgive everyone's sin
[1:45:50] and all this stuff
[1:45:52] and we haven't been able to pin it on
[1:45:53] him yet but we caught this
[1:45:55] like you know that blind man we're
[1:45:57] pretty sure him and his or his parents
[1:45:59] sinned but we can't prove it
[1:46:02] and the woman and the man who was who
[1:46:04] came down through the roof and was it
[1:46:05] was lame and he he healed him and he
[1:46:08] said go and sin no more
[1:46:11] we know that guys sinned a lot
[1:46:14] but we can't prove nothing
[1:46:16] but this one we caught our sinning
[1:46:19] now let's see him get out of this
[1:46:23] right they had a lot of knowledge all
[1:46:26] together they were really smart
[1:46:29] real smart
[1:46:30] like i wouldn't have a chance
[1:46:34] and here they go they bring them
[1:46:37] and they throw her down before jesus and
[1:46:39] say jesus
[1:46:41] all right we got one for you this time
[1:46:43] you can't get out you're not going to
[1:46:44] get out of this
[1:46:46] you're not going to be able to play mr
[1:46:48] nice guy
[1:46:50] and
[1:46:51] still stay within the law
[1:46:54] what they didn't know was he was the law
[1:46:59] that was the difference they had a
[1:47:00] knowledge of the law
[1:47:02] but he was the embodiment of the law
[1:47:07] and he knew it better than any of them
[1:47:09] could
[1:47:16] and he doesn't say anything to them
[1:47:19] he doesn't even say anything to the
[1:47:20] woman
[1:47:22] he bends over and he begins riding in
[1:47:24] the dust
[1:47:26] we don't know what he wrote
[1:47:27] what we do know
[1:47:29] is it says from the oldest to the
[1:47:32] youngest
[1:47:33] they walked away
[1:47:36] why
[1:47:38] because even those pharisees and
[1:47:40] sadducees who thought
[1:47:42] their lives were so perfect
[1:47:45] they had they had it down to
[1:47:48] every
[1:47:50] knot
[1:47:51] every
[1:47:52] little line
[1:47:53] everything
[1:47:57] but when when he began to
[1:47:59] write out the revelation of the very
[1:48:02] laws and commandments that they thought
[1:48:04] they knew so well
[1:48:06] in detail
[1:48:07] one by one
[1:48:11] he doesn't even have to write their sins
[1:48:13] personal
[1:48:15] their own knowledge caught them
[1:48:19] because they remembered
[1:48:21] he who is guilty of the least of these
[1:48:24] is guilty of them all
[1:48:27] so in order to have him judge her
[1:48:31] the woman they brought before him
[1:48:35] they had come and presented them
[1:48:37] themselves all for judgment
[1:48:45] because no flesh can stand in the
[1:48:47] presence of a holy god
[1:48:51] you see
[1:48:52] and that's where we stand as well
[1:48:55] be careful that we don't now i don't say
[1:48:57] you don't call out sin
[1:49:00] that's not it
[1:49:01] calm down
[1:49:03] it's going to be okay
[1:49:06] but what i mean is
[1:49:09] is jesus was able to look
[1:49:14] at each and every one
[1:49:17] no matter how old they were
[1:49:19] how well known they were in the church
[1:49:21] from the the pastor the high priest down
[1:49:24] to the person who who swept the street
[1:49:28] and not one of them got away
[1:49:31] each one of them had something they were
[1:49:33] still dealing with in their life
[1:49:36] and by knowledge they knew they were all
[1:49:38] guilty of death
[1:49:41] of stoning
[1:49:43] just like that woman they'd cast before
[1:49:45] him
[1:49:46] death was the only answer
[1:49:49] by way of the law
[1:49:50] and they were all guilty
[1:49:54] and since it's hard to throw stones at
[1:49:55] yourself
[1:49:57] they dropped them and walked away
[1:50:00] and jesus response
[1:50:02] was woman
[1:50:04] where art thine accusers
[1:50:09] you know she wasn't even aware of what
[1:50:10] was going on around her
[1:50:12] the commandments of men were holding her
[1:50:15] in so much fear
[1:50:17] she just was waiting for the first stone
[1:50:19] to strike her
[1:50:21] it was the inevitable she saw no way out
[1:50:28] and since each one left one at a time
[1:50:31] and walked away silently
[1:50:34] she was still waiting for judgment to
[1:50:36] strike and he said woman
[1:50:39] where are thine accusers
[1:50:42] and she looked up and said
[1:50:44] they're all gone lord
[1:50:46] he said neither
[1:50:48] do i accuse thee
[1:50:52] and here's where
[1:50:54] the church world and denomination gets
[1:50:56] it wrong they stop there
[1:50:59] they stop at neither do we accuse thee
[1:51:01] god loves everybody
[1:51:04] but he didn't do that
[1:51:06] he said neither do i accuse thee
[1:51:10] go
[1:51:11] and sin
[1:51:12] no more
[1:51:14] now
[1:51:15] that was not another rule or a
[1:51:18] commandment but prophecy over her life
[1:51:23] the difference is is one she would have
[1:51:25] to do herself
[1:51:27] which is the law of moses and the blood
[1:51:30] of bulls and goats that she'd been a
[1:51:32] part of her whole life
[1:51:35] her life of religion
[1:51:39] that all had done is brought her to the
[1:51:40] spot where she is at where the religion
[1:51:42] was about to put her to death
[1:51:47] but the difference between that and
[1:51:49] prophecy over her
[1:51:51] is when god puts forth thus saith the
[1:51:54] lord over your life
[1:51:55] it's not for you to bring to pass
[1:51:58] it's for him to bring to pass
[1:52:00] so each time you see god
[1:52:03] christ himself throughout scripture tell
[1:52:05] someone go and sin no more
[1:52:11] he's not giving them an instruction
[1:52:15] but he's prophesying over their life
[1:52:20] for where their next step is going to go
[1:52:23] it doesn't mean you'll never trip up
[1:52:25] you'll never fail doesn't mean you'll
[1:52:27] never backslide
[1:52:30] in fact the minute you get for each time
[1:52:33] god blesses you get ready
[1:52:35] no matter what type of blessing it is
[1:52:38] in fact if it's a spiritual blessing get
[1:52:40] ready all the more
[1:52:42] if you've just had god has come and
[1:52:44] revealed something to you personally and
[1:52:46] the holy spirit is working on your life
[1:52:48] get ready
[1:52:50] because the devil's going to come at you
[1:52:54] and you know
[1:52:56] it's possible
[1:52:59] you might stumble
[1:53:02] but you won't fall and you won't stay
[1:53:04] down
[1:53:06] because god is using it he's working
[1:53:08] things out in your life
[1:53:11] we can see this in the lives of the
[1:53:13] apostles
[1:53:14] look at peter himself
[1:53:17] good example right
[1:53:19] is
[1:53:21] peter
[1:53:23] if all the people who had a revelation
[1:53:25] you would think it was peter
[1:53:28] upon this rock of revelation christ said
[1:53:30] i'll build my church he said peter i
[1:53:32] give you the keys
[1:53:34] right
[1:53:35] now we know that was
[1:53:37] symbolic but peter had all these
[1:53:39] experiences
[1:53:42] and he's out and he's teaching and he's
[1:53:44] preaching and he had the experience with
[1:53:47] at cornelius house
[1:53:49] after he had been at simon the tanners
[1:53:51] and and that she had come down with all
[1:53:52] those unclean animals in it and the lord
[1:53:55] told him rise up and eat right
[1:53:58] he had a personal experience where god
[1:53:59] had spoke to him and told him don't call
[1:54:02] unclean what i call clean
[1:54:05] i mean how much more clear could it be
[1:54:06] then he sends him over to cornelius
[1:54:08] house and they all received the holy
[1:54:10] ghost before even being baptized
[1:54:12] peter saw that peter was a part of that
[1:54:15] he was the spearhead of that
[1:54:18] first one to go to the gentiles
[1:54:21] okay
[1:54:22] and we get a few years down the road
[1:54:28] and you know what peter's doing
[1:54:31] he's playing favorites
[1:54:35] and he is
[1:54:36] playing a religious game
[1:54:38] between the jews and the gentiles
[1:54:41] when the jews aren't there he eats with
[1:54:43] the gentiles freely when the jews are
[1:54:45] there he separates himself
[1:54:48] so he can still look good under the law
[1:54:51] peter
[1:54:57] you know how we know that because it
[1:54:59] says so in scripture
[1:55:01] paul had to openly rebuke him
[1:55:05] he said peter what are you doing
[1:55:10] you know better
[1:55:14] and he had to repent
[1:55:16] get up and keep moving
[1:55:19] it doesn't mean he didn't have the holy
[1:55:20] ghost
[1:55:21] doesn't mean that god wasn't revealing
[1:55:22] things to him
[1:55:24] it means he had a slip up it means he
[1:55:27] stumbled it means something was put in
[1:55:29] his way
[1:55:31] but god allows that because he's working
[1:55:34] in our lives and he's going to use that
[1:55:35] to bless someone else down the road
[1:55:38] so if you've had a situation where
[1:55:39] you're like wow i really messed that up
[1:55:41] how could i have done that
[1:55:45] don't worry about it
[1:55:47] if god's revealed it to you
[1:55:49] just move on
[1:55:51] if he sends someone nicely to tell you
[1:55:53] hey
[1:55:54] you know
[1:55:56] brother jordan
[1:55:57] i notice when you're around this person
[1:55:59] and this person you do this thing and
[1:56:00] that thing and around this other person
[1:56:02] you don't
[1:56:04] and it seems a little bit like a double
[1:56:05] standard
[1:56:07] don't make any excuses no you know it's
[1:56:10] because of this and this and that they
[1:56:11] say oh wow
[1:56:14] i'm so sorry
[1:56:17] i i apologize and i need to go make that
[1:56:19] right with these other brothers
[1:56:21] you know that's what peter had to do he
[1:56:22] had to get all of them together that
[1:56:24] he'd been playing this game with the
[1:56:25] gentiles and the and his jewish brethren
[1:56:28] put them all in one room mix them all
[1:56:30] together i bet that was a tense
[1:56:32] situation
[1:56:34] probably a line right down the middle
[1:56:36] right
[1:56:38] segregated all the way
[1:56:41] and peter got to get before and be like
[1:56:43] well brothers
[1:56:45] i have something to confess
[1:56:49] i've fallen into an old rut under the
[1:56:51] law
[1:56:54] and i'm living a double standard and a
[1:56:56] double life
[1:56:58] and i'm not being the example of christ
[1:57:00] to you that i should be
[1:57:02] and i have to ask all of you to forgive
[1:57:03] me and know that it's wrong
[1:57:07] and we are all one in christ
[1:57:11] and move forward
[1:57:14] and move forward now we don't ever see
[1:57:16] where paul ever mentioned that about
[1:57:17] peter again
[1:57:20] because that is the spirit of christ the
[1:57:22] correction comes you make it right you
[1:57:25] move on and from there we you go
[1:57:28] straight into the book of hebrews
[1:57:30] where all it is is one hero of the faith
[1:57:33] after another
[1:57:35] where god just lists them and and and by
[1:57:38] faith
[1:57:39] juan hernandez and by faith stephen
[1:57:42] jambivi and by faith
[1:57:44] joshua ali and by faith and by faith and
[1:57:48] by faith and just insert your name amen
[1:57:51] that's the end of the story
[1:57:55] if you make it right
[1:57:59] and that should be the end of the story
[1:58:01] for each one of us
[1:58:04] with each other because so many times
[1:58:08] we know too much about each other
[1:58:11] and what i mean by that
[1:58:13] is we we keep too much on our memory
[1:58:15] bank
[1:58:18] because
[1:58:20] someone will have done something in
[1:58:22] their past
[1:58:24] and they've made it right
[1:58:26] and they've asked for forgiveness from
[1:58:28] whoever it is that they have to that
[1:58:29] they did wrong
[1:58:30] they've asked for forgiveness from the
[1:58:32] lord
[1:58:33] and they've been forgiven
[1:58:35] on both accounts
[1:58:36] on all accounts
[1:58:39] but you've got a little tally book
[1:58:41] whether it's physical or in your brain
[1:58:43] or you remember
[1:58:45] i remember that time you did that i
[1:58:47] remember the time you said that i
[1:58:49] remember that time you weren't acting so
[1:58:51] christ-like
[1:58:53] i remember the time when you kind of had
[1:58:54] a funny belief
[1:58:57] and then someone they'll come to you and
[1:58:59] say you know brother i just noticed this
[1:59:01] or sister i noticed this that you know i
[1:59:03] just don't think that's very christ-like
[1:59:05] and i just wanted to let you know
[1:59:07] um
[1:59:08] come to you just in case it's something
[1:59:10] you weren't aware of or and if i'm wrong
[1:59:11] then i'm wrong and you forgive me for
[1:59:13] that
[1:59:14] and we go aha
[1:59:16] who are you to be telling me
[1:59:18] i remember when you
[1:59:21] why
[1:59:24] because we're we're not
[1:59:28] we're not feeling very safe in what we
[1:59:30] believe
[1:59:33] if you know that you know that you know
[1:59:37] then a challenge of faith whether it
[1:59:40] comes by way of someone challenging what
[1:59:42] you believe or it comes by way of
[1:59:45] someone challenged you to believe more
[1:59:48] and that's what that is
[1:59:50] a someone coming to you in love
[1:59:54] to to say hey
[1:59:56] you know i just noticed this
[1:59:59] now that's not open
[2:00:01] open room for everyone to just go
[2:00:02] criticizing everyone because you don't
[2:00:04] like the way they do something you
[2:00:05] better know that it has a scriptural
[2:00:07] basis
[2:00:08] so i say be careful
[2:00:10] because you may fall into the realm of
[2:00:12] tempting the lord thy god
[2:00:17] but
[2:00:18] but the true way the the
[2:00:20] body was meant to work
[2:00:23] in union with each other supporting each
[2:00:26] other lifting each other up
[2:00:30] whether it's lifting each other up in in
[2:00:32] in in
[2:00:34] a kind word
[2:00:36] or in in whatever it is some type of
[2:00:38] support
[2:00:39] or going to them you're also lifting
[2:00:41] someone up and saying hey
[2:00:43] i think you can do a little bit better
[2:00:46] i think we can do better together
[2:00:55] and if i'm wrong in saying that then
[2:00:57] forgive me for that
[2:01:00] and lift each other up
[2:01:02] right
[2:01:03] because we're meant to as iron
[2:01:05] sharpeneth iron
[2:01:06] to strengthen each other
[2:01:09] it's even common and when we come and we
[2:01:10] discuss the word
[2:01:12] and we're thinking about things you know
[2:01:14] there's things that
[2:01:15] we've
[2:01:17] over the last 20 and 30 years or
[2:01:19] whatever however long it's been we've
[2:01:21] heard certain people say certain things
[2:01:23] you're like oh that sounds good i
[2:01:24] believe that
[2:01:27] and you just go on
[2:01:28] knowledge you take it as a word of
[2:01:30] knowledge right
[2:01:31] and
[2:01:32] it sounded good and the person who said
[2:01:34] it said it real well and a little bit
[2:01:36] later someone else comes along and says
[2:01:37] something you're like well that don't
[2:01:39] drive right
[2:01:40] well you got to be wrong
[2:01:43] because i'm not wrong
[2:01:46] and there's two options for that well
[2:01:48] never mind there's three
[2:01:51] either one of you is wrong
[2:01:53] both of you are wrong
[2:01:55] or neither of you are wrong
[2:02:00] you see but we don't typically give
[2:02:02] ourselves those options
[2:02:04] we typically as human beings only have
[2:02:06] two options
[2:02:07] i'm right or you're right which means
[2:02:09] i'm wrong or you're wrong
[2:02:11] and i already know i'm right which means
[2:02:13] you're wrong
[2:02:15] but that's not the way the scripture is
[2:02:19] you see because god reveals things to
[2:02:21] people and that take that same scripture
[2:02:23] that you read and you saw and you're
[2:02:25] like wow
[2:02:27] that's so beautiful
[2:02:29] and he'll open it up to someone else and
[2:02:31] they'll see something totally different
[2:02:33] now they'll both be
[2:02:35] according to the word
[2:02:38] because you should be able to take
[2:02:40] whatever that thought is whatever that
[2:02:41] idea is whatever that revelation is and
[2:02:44] trace it throughout the scripture from
[2:02:46] genesis to revelation and see it ring
[2:02:48] true
[2:02:49] back and forth back and forth
[2:02:53] and you should
[2:02:56] so when someone comes and says something
[2:02:58] and challenges you like wow i've never
[2:03:00] heard it that way before
[2:03:04] share a little bit more with me where do
[2:03:05] you see that where are you seeing that
[2:03:07] in the scripture how are you seeing that
[2:03:09] where are you seeing that in the message
[2:03:12] and not in a challenging way because
[2:03:13] many times you're like well
[2:03:16] i don't know that doesn't sound right to
[2:03:18] me show me
[2:03:20] right
[2:03:23] but it's more it should be more
[2:03:25] i've never seen that before
[2:03:28] and take that approach well maybe god is
[2:03:31] trying to show you something new
[2:03:33] and maybe he's using someone else to do
[2:03:35] it
[2:03:36] because that's what brother ram said he
[2:03:38] said the hardest thing god ever had to
[2:03:41] do was get one man to believe another
[2:03:43] man
[2:03:45] that's why it's the foolishness of
[2:03:46] preaching
[2:03:48] why
[2:03:49] because
[2:03:51] we all come before you flawed
[2:03:55] human beings
[2:03:56] flawed men
[2:03:58] each one of us comes to each other
[2:04:00] flawed people
[2:04:04] and the hardest thing god has to do is
[2:04:07] get you to believe that he could use
[2:04:08] someone else so flawed
[2:04:11] and how do you know they're so flawed
[2:04:13] because you know yourself and how flawed
[2:04:15] you are even though you may not admit it
[2:04:17] to yourself or anyone else
[2:04:20] and if you know that of yourself
[2:04:22] then you naturally will assume that of
[2:04:24] everybody else
[2:04:27] and that's the hardest thing god has to
[2:04:29] do
[2:04:30] is use someone else that you know has so
[2:04:32] many flaws
[2:04:34] to come and bring something to you
[2:04:36] that is truth
[2:04:39] especially if you're not
[2:04:41] wanting to hear it
[2:04:45] but that's why our approach has always
[2:04:47] got to be lord
[2:04:48] whatever it is
[2:04:51] let me not be afraid
[2:04:54] let me not fear
[2:04:57] the challenge of my faith
[2:05:00] let me say lord let every opportunity be
[2:05:02] won for me lord show me a little bit
[2:05:05] more
[2:05:09] but if you don't
[2:05:10] the first thing you do is you you'll
[2:05:12] shut that person down
[2:05:14] as quickly as possible
[2:05:16] now you've lost your ability
[2:05:19] to share the truth with them
[2:05:23] so you've broken that line of
[2:05:24] communication
[2:05:25] you've broken that
[2:05:27] fellowship
[2:05:30] and that's what the devil wanted the
[2:05:31] whole time anyways
[2:05:35] is that
[2:05:36] he may want you
[2:05:40] god may have set that that person in
[2:05:43] your path
[2:05:44] whether it's at church at work at school
[2:05:47] someone you invited over to your house
[2:05:49] to fellowship with
[2:05:51] either because you need something or
[2:05:53] they need something
[2:05:55] and the minute you shut it down and
[2:05:57] break fellowship
[2:05:58] it's not going to happen anymore
[2:06:01] now there's a wedge between brothers
[2:06:07] but if you'll just humbly
[2:06:09] say lord
[2:06:11] use me
[2:06:14] in whatever way you will
[2:06:16] whether you have something to teach me
[2:06:18] or you have something you would like me
[2:06:20] to share with this individual
[2:06:23] and help me to remain humble
[2:06:25] you see because that was the example
[2:06:29] of the prophet of this age i got one
[2:06:31] quote
[2:06:34] that i want to read to you
[2:06:36] that i feel like many of us find
[2:06:38] ourselves in
[2:06:40] but
[2:06:42] and then one example
[2:06:45] is standing in the gap and brother
[2:06:47] branham's talking a little bit before
[2:06:48] about his ministry and how god's kept
[2:06:51] him and how he's done his best to walk
[2:06:54] by faith but too many of the times he
[2:06:56] he just
[2:06:59] waited for god to do everything and the
[2:07:01] angel of the lord told him don't do that
[2:07:02] no more
[2:07:04] he said i gotta try walking by faith
[2:07:06] more
[2:07:07] and just step out no matter what the
[2:07:09] consequence and what i believe god is
[2:07:11] doing in my life
[2:07:13] knowing that god will catch me if i go
[2:07:15] in the wrong direction
[2:07:17] and he keeps going and this is 1963. so
[2:07:20] think this is we're just a couple years
[2:07:22] from the end of his ministry
[2:07:24] right
[2:07:25] so he's not a young minister
[2:07:27] he's not young in the gospel
[2:07:30] he's been through a lot of battles he's
[2:07:32] been a lot of places god's revealed a
[2:07:33] lot of things to him
[2:07:36] in paragraph 159 i don't know if you can
[2:07:38] find that josh but if not i'll just read
[2:07:40] it
[2:07:41] and these
[2:07:42] ricky's enriquetas that we have so
[2:07:44] sassed
[2:07:45] the words
[2:07:46] and i've called them ricky and raquetta
[2:07:49] god gave me to understand i shouldn't do
[2:07:51] that
[2:07:52] because that's many of them are still
[2:07:54] his children
[2:07:55] i'm they can't help because they act so
[2:07:57] much different
[2:07:58] some of these old cold formal churches
[2:08:01] has got them that spirit upon them and
[2:08:04] they're in
[2:08:05] prison as israel was in prison just as
[2:08:07] moses went down to deliver them from
[2:08:09] slavery
[2:08:10] human beings that love jesus christ
[2:08:12] would serve him if they only know what
[2:08:15] to serve him by
[2:08:17] and they're in bondage under
[2:08:18] denominationalism that tells him don't
[2:08:21] you do this and don't you do that
[2:08:25] but the call of god must come whoever
[2:08:28] wants to march towards the promised land
[2:08:30] let him march we're on our road to the
[2:08:32] promised land amen
[2:08:34] let them come march we're on our road to
[2:08:36] meet christ
[2:08:37] at the end time
[2:08:40] and i want to bring this to you so that
[2:08:42] you would see
[2:08:43] and show you that the mistake a man can
[2:08:46] make yet being sincere
[2:08:49] moses lost the feeling of the of his
[2:08:51] people because they wouldn't listen to
[2:08:53] him
[2:08:54] and brother roy you see
[2:08:56] your dream and now i cannot go
[2:08:58] i cannot go with a ministry like that
[2:09:01] until i feel different in my heart about
[2:09:03] it
[2:09:04] no matter if god did tell me
[2:09:07] but that
[2:09:09] is that change that brother roy that's
[2:09:11] seen coming something's got to change me
[2:09:13] because i in my heart if i go out there
[2:09:16] feeling the way i do now i still feel
[2:09:18] that they ought to have heard that
[2:09:20] message they ought to have done it
[2:09:23] and i don't have the feeling for the
[2:09:25] people that i should
[2:09:27] until i can get that feeling there's no
[2:09:30] need in me going because i'd be a
[2:09:32] hypocrite
[2:09:33] and all these years i tried to serve him
[2:09:35] with a true heart and i won't go out
[2:09:38] there being a hypocrite i got to feel
[2:09:40] that that that isn't ricky and raketa it
[2:09:44] isn't this bunch it's god's children
[2:09:47] that's in bondage
[2:09:48] that i must go to until i can feel that
[2:09:51] way i'll just have to loaf around and
[2:09:53] preach some conventions and things but
[2:09:56] wait
[2:10:00] you see here
[2:10:01] the prophet of the lord
[2:10:04] it had
[2:10:06] preached and he had
[2:10:09] spoken to the people he said every time
[2:10:12] i preach every time i go across the
[2:10:15] country and every time i come back he
[2:10:17] said it's worse than ever before
[2:10:21] i feel like what's the point
[2:10:24] and he began blasting the people
[2:10:28] because he took personal offense
[2:10:31] that they were not accepting his message
[2:10:37] like samuel
[2:10:39] samuel said lord what's what's going on
[2:10:41] with saul
[2:10:43] he's rejecting me
[2:10:45] and god told him he's not rejecting you
[2:10:47] he's rejected me
[2:10:49] this isn't between you and saul
[2:10:52] and and we see here a prophet the lord
[2:10:54] of this age
[2:10:56] got that same
[2:10:58] feeling that same attitude
[2:11:01] where he said what's the point i scour
[2:11:04] across the nation i preach the truth and
[2:11:06] it just gets worse and worse and worse
[2:11:09] and he wasn't talking about the world he
[2:11:10] was talking about the churches
[2:11:13] every single time
[2:11:17] and the lord the angel of the lord came
[2:11:19] to him and said you got to stop that
[2:11:22] he said you're beating the people
[2:11:25] he said and those are my children
[2:11:28] he said don't worry about the masses
[2:11:30] this was never about the masses
[2:11:33] this is about calling the few the chosen
[2:11:37] and that one that you think is that
[2:11:38] ricky that ricketta
[2:11:40] the one that you see that you think is
[2:11:42] going so far
[2:11:44] that's my son that's my daughter
[2:11:46] i'm working
[2:11:48] not you
[2:11:49] this is not your work to begin with it's
[2:11:51] been my work from the very beginning
[2:11:54] and i am still working
[2:11:59] i am still working
[2:12:01] and he said
[2:12:03] until
[2:12:05] i can get over this
[2:12:07] until my heart is right towards the
[2:12:10] people
[2:12:11] you know he said that about prayer lines
[2:12:14] he said whenever i pray for someone
[2:12:18] he said i try and put myself in their
[2:12:20] shoes
[2:12:23] so i can feel what they're feeling
[2:12:26] and enter into that that
[2:12:30] prayer for them
[2:12:31] for deliverance
[2:12:33] for whatever it is
[2:12:35] this is because if i'm not standing in
[2:12:36] that same place as them he said i can't
[2:12:39] be as
[2:12:40] the same amount of help
[2:12:43] and it's the same all across the board
[2:12:47] it's that humility of spirit lord
[2:12:50] if it were not for grace
[2:12:55] there's where i would be too
[2:12:58] you see
[2:13:00] and as
[2:13:01] a revelation of grace pours out in your
[2:13:03] heart
[2:13:08] and you see something
[2:13:10] and you see someone failing you see
[2:13:12] someone struggling you see someone going
[2:13:14] through something
[2:13:16] your first reaction isn't
[2:13:18] the same as the scribes and pharisees
[2:13:21] isn't the same as those who on the the
[2:13:26] the man who was left
[2:13:28] beaten and bloody
[2:13:30] and the scribes and pharisees walked
[2:13:32] around him so as that not to dirty their
[2:13:34] garments
[2:13:35] perchance
[2:13:38] his filth might get on me
[2:13:44] but our reaction should be
[2:13:48] the same as
[2:13:49] the good samaritan
[2:13:52] and that is to come in
[2:13:56] and do all we can to
[2:13:59] bind them up
[2:14:01] bind the broken-hearted
[2:14:03] to raise them up to encourage them
[2:14:07] that story was not just about someone
[2:14:10] who was physically beaten and bruised
[2:14:12] see bones and flesh are easier to heal
[2:14:16] but a broken spirit
[2:14:20] a damaged heart
[2:14:25] a life lost in sin
[2:14:28] those are the things that
[2:14:30] truly require binding require healing
[2:14:33] require attending to
[2:14:36] but we're so worried
[2:14:38] sometimes that if we were to associate
[2:14:42] ourselves with that
[2:14:44] we might get our own garments dirty
[2:14:46] by association
[2:14:51] and that wasn't our example of christ
[2:14:54] that wasn't our example of any of god's
[2:14:56] true servants
[2:15:00] he went to them in their need
[2:15:03] the place where they needed him
[2:15:05] and he didn't
[2:15:06] condemn they said how can i help you
[2:15:10] zacchaeus come down out of that tree i'm
[2:15:12] going to your house today
[2:15:15] what you're a tax collector in public
[2:15:17] and i know
[2:15:18] i knew all that before you got up in the
[2:15:20] tree this morning you really didn't need
[2:15:21] to do that
[2:15:26] as short as you are
[2:15:29] being who i am i would have found you
[2:15:31] anyways
[2:15:34] right
[2:15:35] like blind
[2:15:36] bartimaeus calling out from the roadside
[2:15:39] they say the den around those gates was
[2:15:41] so loud
[2:15:43] most of the time with a crowd of that
[2:15:45] size there is no possible earthly way he
[2:15:48] would have ever heard him
[2:15:54] so it wasn't his yelling
[2:15:57] it wasn't his crying out
[2:15:58] but it was his heart
[2:16:01] that touched the
[2:16:02] savior you see
[2:16:05] and that's how it is for each of us
[2:16:08] is
[2:16:09] we should as grace has taken a hold in
[2:16:12] our lives
[2:16:13] then
[2:16:15] if it's grace in your heart then grace
[2:16:18] is what should come from the heart
[2:16:21] you see the same level of forgiveness as
[2:16:22] what you've received
[2:16:24] is what should be given
[2:16:28] forgiveness should never establish a
[2:16:30] self-righteousness
[2:16:32] but forgiveness
[2:16:35] helps you to acknowledge
[2:16:37] how far gone you were when the savior
[2:16:41] saved you
[2:16:43] and how great his grace is
[2:16:46] that can be extended to your neighbor
[2:16:51] you see belief
[2:16:54] if you believe you're forgiven
[2:16:56] it'll create an action or you can extend
[2:16:59] that same belief to anyone else
[2:17:02] there's no one so far
[2:17:05] gone
[2:17:06] but what can be saved
[2:17:09] if they have faith
[2:17:11] and believe
[2:17:12] and if it takes effect in their lives
[2:17:15] so i say to each one of you who
[2:17:18] has accepted that
[2:17:20] forgiveness
[2:17:22] find someone
[2:17:24] to extend that forgiveness too
[2:17:26] because that's what it was meant for
[2:17:28] gifts given to you
[2:17:30] were not just meant to be held
[2:17:33] but they were meant to be shared
[2:17:35] and those of you looking for forgiveness
[2:17:40] stop trying to forgive yourself it'll
[2:17:42] never work
[2:17:45] just believe in the work he's already
[2:17:47] done
[2:17:50] are you
[2:17:51] if you're struggling with something
[2:17:57] if you're struggling with the way you
[2:17:58] dress
[2:18:00] in church in school at work
[2:18:04] all the above
[2:18:07] don't worry about it
[2:18:11] just get deeper in love with jesus
[2:18:15] ask him
[2:18:18] ask him for a closer relationship
[2:18:21] a closer walk
[2:18:22] said lord i just want to love you more
[2:18:25] musicians would come and actually if you
[2:18:27] would play that song
[2:18:29] i just want to love you more
[2:18:33] say lord i just want a deeper
[2:18:34] relationship with you
[2:18:37] i want my friendship to grow i want to
[2:18:40] be like abraham
[2:18:42] as he walked across the
[2:18:44] pain the plains of memory
[2:18:47] and he could look up
[2:18:48] and see three men coming in the distance
[2:18:51] and from a distance
[2:18:52] he could identify
[2:18:54] you
[2:18:55] i want that kind of relationship
[2:18:58] so that in the cooler evening like adam
[2:19:02] you would come down and walk with him
[2:19:04] and speak lip to ear
[2:19:07] lord come and speak to me
[2:19:10] not just here to this morning in church
[2:19:15] but lord every day
[2:19:17] let me walk with you
[2:19:19] come down and move on my heart
[2:19:22] lord let it be that way when i wake up
[2:19:23] in the morning i feel you there
[2:19:26] as i go throughout my day i feel you
[2:19:28] there
[2:19:29] when i go to bed in the evening i feel
[2:19:31] you there
[2:19:34] that
[2:19:36] i always know that
[2:19:38] if i just reach my hand up
[2:19:42] your hand is already reaching down
[2:19:46] to grab a hold of
[2:19:48] and even the times i don't reach up
[2:19:51] you'll catch me if i fall
[2:19:53] to know that your presence is that near
[2:19:57] saints you won't have to worry about the
[2:19:59] things you're struggling with
[2:20:02] one by one they'll just melt away
[2:20:05] like a distant memory and you'll just
[2:20:06] have to you one day you'll be going oh
[2:20:09] didn't i used to do that
[2:20:13] what happened
[2:20:15] i don't i don't even remember the last
[2:20:16] time
[2:20:19] i even had the desire to do that
[2:20:22] you see but if you struggle with it
[2:20:26] and you continue to try and stop doing
[2:20:28] it yourself
[2:20:30] you are spending so much time
[2:20:34] trying not to do something
[2:20:36] you're wasting time you could be
[2:20:37] spending with him
[2:20:41] you see
[2:20:42] if if you're in your room
[2:20:44] or you're in your living room or you're
[2:20:46] wherever it is that you go you're in
[2:20:47] your car
[2:20:49] maybe you're in that little place that
[2:20:50] you're you're you're in college you're
[2:20:52] in school
[2:20:54] you're in class whatever it is
[2:20:56] and you have that little place that you
[2:20:57] go from time to time where or you're
[2:20:59] just walking down the hall and you're
[2:21:01] even in the midst of everybody you're by
[2:21:02] yourself
[2:21:04] in those moments
[2:21:05] [Music]
[2:21:07] instead of worrying about the things
[2:21:08] that you're struggling with
[2:21:10] just reach out to jesus
[2:21:13] say lord
[2:21:14] i sure could use this one more touch
[2:21:16] today
[2:21:18] father i'm just thinking about
[2:21:20] how pressured it is
[2:21:22] here i am i'm walking amongst hundreds
[2:21:24] if not thousands of people
[2:21:26] lord and
[2:21:28] how blessed i am
[2:21:30] that out of these thousands out of these
[2:21:33] hundreds
[2:21:34] of the people in this room
[2:21:37] you chose me and just wait and see how
[2:21:42] how his presence will come down and it
[2:21:44] don't take nothing it doesn't take no
[2:21:46] special formula of a prayer
[2:21:50] it just takes you being sincere
[2:21:52] with him and he'll come on down and and
[2:21:55] all of a sudden you'll you'll feel his
[2:21:57] presence
[2:21:58] and you'll be standing around all these
[2:22:00] people you'll be driving down the road
[2:22:01] you'll be sitting in class
[2:22:04] and all sudden the tears will just start
[2:22:06] coming to your eyes
[2:22:08] and someone will ask you why are you
[2:22:10] crying
[2:22:12] they say i don't know
[2:22:14] i'm just so happy
[2:22:17] i'm just so blessed
[2:22:21] i can't help it
[2:22:23] i can't help it
[2:22:24] to think of where i could have been
[2:22:27] and he saved me from
[2:22:30] and how blessed i am
[2:22:34] to fill his presence
[2:22:38] you know
[2:22:40] it can happen anywhere
[2:22:44] i've been in
[2:22:45] i've been in a
[2:22:47] biology class
[2:22:48] for for the study of evolution
[2:22:53] imagine that
[2:22:54] [Music]
[2:22:55] reading through the books and they're
[2:22:57] talking about it
[2:23:01] and
[2:23:01] all of a sudden night
[2:23:03] a thought comes to me and they say you
[2:23:05] know all these different times that
[2:23:07] there's been catastrophic things happen
[2:23:10] in the earth
[2:23:14] it's always been some form of global
[2:23:15] warming that we think has done it
[2:23:18] and we it's happened six times now
[2:23:21] if it happens again it will be a seventh
[2:23:24] now i'm not making any doctrine or
[2:23:26] anything weird out of it but for me that
[2:23:28] i thought wow
[2:23:30] isn't that amazing
[2:23:33] man is so afraid
[2:23:35] and doing everything they can to alter
[2:23:37] the direction of the earth
[2:23:39] and what's happening
[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:43] and
[2:23:44] yet it is from all intents and purposes
[2:23:48] probably something they cannot put a
[2:23:50] stop to
[2:23:51] and they are so afraid to admit that
[2:23:55] because it puts them out of control
[2:24:00] but how beautiful
[2:24:02] is it
[2:24:03] knowing what we know to hear that we're
[2:24:05] headed towards the seventh
[2:24:08] and i don't know that it means anything
[2:24:10] but for me i just thought
[2:24:12] god is so perfect in all his ways
[2:24:17] how perfect
[2:24:18] that he would come down and with a
[2:24:20] cleansing of fire on the seventh time
[2:24:24] for something beautiful for his children
[2:24:26] will he use this earth again for
[2:24:27] something else i don't know
[2:24:30] has he used it how many times before
[2:24:31] this has he used it i don't know
[2:24:37] all i know is everywhere you start to
[2:24:39] look
[2:24:40] you'll see him
[2:24:42] and you're not afraid
[2:24:44] you're not afraid to to sit in a class
[2:24:47] where they're there
[2:24:49] they think that
[2:24:51] most of what they're teaching is
[2:24:52] contradictory but you'll surprise them
[2:24:54] because you'll go you know what
[2:24:56] they'll say yeah you know
[2:24:57] people who believe the earth is only six
[2:24:59] thousand years old you know the the
[2:25:01] the creationist group and you're like oh
[2:25:03] i don't believe that
[2:25:05] they go what
[2:25:08] yeah no
[2:25:09] we don't know how old the earth is the
[2:25:11] bible doesn't say so
[2:25:13] all we know
[2:25:15] was that
[2:25:16] out of a darkness and a void
[2:25:19] he began to work
[2:25:21] and the history of man as we know it is
[2:25:23] what we believe to be about 6 000 years
[2:25:25] old
[2:25:28] you see
[2:25:29] it takes all the argument out
[2:25:32] takes it all away
[2:25:33] and you can just focus on him
[2:25:36] you know so many times we're so focused
[2:25:39] on trying to defend
[2:25:41] the bible or defend the message or
[2:25:43] defend this it doesn't need you to
[2:25:45] defend it
[2:25:47] you see
[2:25:49] when jesus told the disciples that he
[2:25:51] was going to send them into all the ends
[2:25:52] of the earth and before kings and
[2:25:54] potentiates
[2:25:57] he didn't sell them okay so here's what
[2:25:58] you're going to do get the books of
[2:25:59] moses get the books of the prophet
[2:26:02] matthew mark luke
[2:26:04] john you guys i want you to write out
[2:26:07] the history of what happened here with
[2:26:08] me
[2:26:09] and i always want you to study it really
[2:26:11] well
[2:26:12] because you need to know every single
[2:26:14] word so you go before these people you
[2:26:16] can make a proper argument
[2:26:20] he didn't say that
[2:26:22] and he doesn't say that today
[2:26:25] he said
[2:26:26] have no fear
[2:26:28] but when you go before them
[2:26:30] i'll give you the words to say
[2:26:34] he didn't say they'll all believe you
[2:26:37] but he said you can go without fear
[2:26:40] knowing that when you stand there
[2:26:44] in the presence of jehovah
[2:26:46] not in the presence of some king not in
[2:26:48] the presence of some teacher not in the
[2:26:50] presence of some boss some supervisor
[2:26:53] not in the presence of a classmate
[2:26:56] not in the presence of a teammate
[2:26:58] in the presence of jehovah why
[2:27:01] he said wherever you go they're all be
[2:27:05] said if you'll just acknowledge me i'm
[2:27:06] there
[2:27:09] and when you get to speak
[2:27:11] don't worry about it don't don't think
[2:27:13] oh i gotta say just the right thing just
[2:27:16] let him speak through you
[2:27:20] let him speak through you to that
[2:27:21] classmate
[2:27:22] let him speak through you to that
[2:27:23] co-worker
[2:27:25] and he don't worry about it because
[2:27:27] he'll give you the exact right time to
[2:27:28] do it too you don't have to struggle
[2:27:30] with that either
[2:27:33] but he'll give you the right moment and
[2:27:35] you'll know it is
[2:27:37] because you'll just feel that presence
[2:27:38] come down
[2:27:39] [Music]
[2:27:41] right there
[2:27:42] and you'll be speaking and it won't
[2:27:43] matter what's going on around you
[2:27:48] but you'll be fellowshipping
[2:27:51] and god will be moving on the scene
[2:27:54] how much if god can do that with you and
[2:27:57] an unbeliever
[2:28:01] how much more can he do that with each
[2:28:02] one of us when we get together in
[2:28:04] fellowship
[2:28:06] we bring our lips of fire together
[2:28:08] don't worry about saying the right thing
[2:28:11] let him speak
[2:28:12] let him speak through you let him speak
[2:28:14] through your brother dear sister
[2:28:16] let's pray
[2:28:18] heavenly father lord has come before you
