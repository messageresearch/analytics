[0:00] She she died
[0:02] and it was coming Christmas time and
[0:21] the little wife being weakly, she she
[0:24] died.
[0:26] And it was coming Christmas time and the
[0:28] little girl she had developed from
[0:31] malnutrition, not having the right food
[0:33] and things. uh she took TV also and
[0:37] she's a little fella about eight nine
[0:41] years old 10 and she had never had a
[0:45] doll for Christmas and that's what she
[0:47] wanted for a gift was a doll
[0:51] and the father not able to give her
[0:54] medical attention and so forth and he he
[0:57] seen the little girl was going fast and
[0:59] he tried his best to to to get enough
[1:03] money together to get her a doll for
[1:05] Christmas if he could just get enough to
[1:08] buy her a little doll. And so the
[1:13] Christmas time was coming on, the bad
[1:15] weather set in. The little girl
[1:17] developed some kind of a pneumonia and
[1:20] and died just a few weeks before
[1:24] Christmas.
[1:25] And the father of course brokenhearted
[1:29] went to his little tin can and got the
[1:31] money out and he thought of his little
[1:34] girl and she wanted a doll like a little
[1:38] girl. See it's a little mother coming
[1:40] on. You notice how a little girl she
[1:42] goes to doll because she's that's her
[1:43] nature. She's a she's a coming mother.
[1:47] She will be mother someday she lives and
[1:50] everything nor nature. That's a little
[1:52] girl likes a little doll. she might take
[1:53] care of because after all she she's a
[1:55] little potentially a little mother and
[1:59] she wanted a little doll. She never had
[2:01] one. Daddy had saved everything he could
[2:05] to get her a little doll. And so she
[2:08] died and the father kind of had a lapse
[2:12] of mind. his wife had been taking this
[2:15] little girl in his mind kind of got to a
[2:18] place that he still he go to bed every
[2:21] night and talked to this little girl
[2:23] though she was been buried but he
[2:25] thought he he was talking to her and
[2:27] tell her now honey it won't be long and
[2:29] daddy's going to get you this dolly for
[2:31] Christmas and daddy's promised you the
[2:34] dolly and I I'm I'm going to get it
[2:36] finally Christmas arrive and of course
[2:40] you know how it is the rich had their
[2:42] their big parties and the candles
[2:46] burning and the great high masses in the
[2:49] churches and talking about Jesus and and
[2:53] so forth. The churches were going
[2:55] through all kind of routines of mass and
[2:59] singing and carols and everything.
[3:02] Little did they know what was going on
[3:05] back in the alley behind all this. this
[3:09] uh little fella back there and he got
[3:11] beside himself. He wanted that little
[3:13] girl to have that doll so bad cuz she
[3:15] had begged soul for this little doll.
[3:19] So he went out and he bought her a
[3:22] little rag doll, a little uh little
[3:25] thing probably about 30 cents, a little
[3:27] dirty something you bought down on the
[3:29] side of the street. And it was a real
[3:32] cold night.
[3:33] the the blizzard winds are blowing, snow
[3:36] falling hard there in New York out on
[3:38] the coast, the streets filling up and
[3:40] the people in their great big limousine
[3:43] cars and drunken parties out drinking
[3:46] the celebration of the birth of Christ
[3:48] and of these things that we speak of
[3:51] tonight trying to think that that's the
[3:53] right way to do it is to drink off their
[3:56] old sorrows and things and that's that's
[3:58] the way to do it. call them stand in the
[4:00] store the other day and the woman talked
[4:01] about what two girls met who won't know
[4:03] what they got for their daddy and one of
[4:05] them said well she got him a carton of
[4:07] certain kind of cigarettes and the other
[4:09] said she got him a fifth of whiskey and
[4:10] a and a and a deck of car that ain't
[4:14] giving a memorial gift for the birth of
[4:17] the Lord Jesus Christ and that's way it
[4:20] goes you see it's just a big bunch of
[4:22] tinsel it hasn't got Christmas in it at
[4:25] all and so we find out this little man.
[4:30] He wandered along and he know his heart
[4:33] his little girl was gone, but he went
[4:35] and bought the doll anyhow. And he
[4:37] thought, "I'll just start walking. I'll
[4:39] find her somewhere. She'll be along the
[4:41] street here. I'll find her." And he
[4:44] started walking. He he couldn't fool
[4:45] himself. She wasn't back there in a
[4:47] little shanty and in the little ragged
[4:49] dirty bed, but uh she was buried. So he
[4:54] he knew he thought he'd find her on the
[4:55] street. He said, "I'll just keep
[4:57] walking." And he's going down through
[4:58] the alleys while they were singing their
[5:01] carols and going on and going down the
[5:03] alley packing this little dirty doll
[5:05] holded in his coat up to his heart,
[5:08] thinking of his little girl. And
[5:10] finally, a policeman happened to see him
[5:12] and policeman had a few drinks himself
[5:16] and he run into the alley and grabbed
[5:18] the old man and turned him around. He
[5:20] said, "What are you doing? I didn't hear
[5:23] him." He said, "I'm taking this little
[5:26] doll, sir, to my little girl." He said,
[5:30] "Where do you live?" And he told him
[5:33] where he lived. He said, "Well, you're
[5:34] going away from that place. You're
[5:36] drunk. Go back the other way." He said,
[5:38] "Sir, I'm not drunk. I promise my little
[5:41] girl I' I'd get her a gift for
[5:43] Christmas."
[5:45] And said, "An appropriate gift for a
[5:47] little girl is a little doll." And he
[5:50] said, "Let me see it." So he showed him
[5:52] a little dirty rag doll and he's holding
[5:56] in his next to his bosom holding a
[5:58] little doll as he. So the policeman half
[6:01] drunk himself shoved him on and started
[6:04] down. The old man went down the alley
[6:06] and snow falling past and
[6:09] well the midnight parties broke up. The
[6:12] next morning the snow lit up. The sun
[6:15] had come out. So they was all the people
[6:19] from their great gay parties. high sacks
[6:21] on their heads from too much drinking
[6:23] and celebration of the the birth of
[6:25] Christ and and many of them were forced
[6:29] and caring all from all the going on.
[6:31] But way down in the alley
[6:34] they found the old man
[6:37] and when he turned him over he had the
[6:39] little doll next to his heart.
[6:43] I suppose he tuck his gift to her. He
[6:45] found her in a land not here.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Right. He he he tucked the gift. It was
[6:50] an appropriate gift.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; God merciful. Yet it cost him his death.
[6:56] There's no other way in the world he
[6:58] could have given her the gift. She was
[7:00] burying him.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; But the only way he could do it would be
[7:03] go like that.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Little doll.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean too much. I guess a little
[7:13] dirty doll, but it What did he do? It
[7:17] fulfilled a promise he had made. Amen.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; No matter what the people thought about
[7:21] it, his dirty hands and a little dirty
[7:24] doll, but it fulfilled a promise to his
[7:26] little girl.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they look upon the gospel, the
[7:31] same thing. They didn't want it when God
[7:34] brought it, but it fulfilled a promise.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; That he would give his son.
[7:40] You know what? They left him to die,
[7:42] too. Just like a on the street.
[7:45] That's
[7:45] &gt;&gt; exactly right. They left him to die like
[7:47] a on the street. And today they
[7:50] treat him like a trap on the street.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; But he fulfilled what he was supposed to
[7:57] do. He was the gift that God promised to
[7:59] the world.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Tonight I let me take him as my savior
[8:03] in my heart.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Let me walk in the face of my death for
[8:07] whatever it is that I
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; I promise my life to him.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; I want to take it to him. No matter
[8:13] where I have to go, if I go through
[8:14] death and I have to be shot, no matter
[8:16] what takes place, I have be laughed at
[8:18] called crazy, everything has to
[8:20] communicate, the rest of the Christians,
[8:21] churches and so forth. Uh it's a gift of
[8:24] God that I hold in my heart.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; I want to take it to our head just
[8:32] appropriate gifts I speak on.
[8:36] It was appropriate gift because the
[8:38] little girl she was a little girl to be
[8:41] little mother would have been an
[8:43] appropriate gift was a little an
[8:45] appropriate gift that God the creator
[8:47] could give to his creation would be a
[8:49] savior to save it from the condition it
[8:51] was in. I wonder tonight as we are
[8:54] approaching Christmas now and I suppose
[8:57] it be the last message we hear between
[8:59] now and Christmas unless we get to the
[9:01] radio messages somewhere.
[9:04] I wonder tonight if we've accepted the
[9:07] gift that God promised us, eternal life
[9:10] in believing on Christ and receiving the
[9:12] Holy Spirit. If you have and you'd like
[9:14] to accept God's real true Christmas
[9:16] gift, would you raise your hand? Say,
[9:18] "Brother Brandon, I I don't know. I I've
[9:22] sometimes believed it and I've watched
[9:24] what things I do and I'm kind of a
[9:26] little bit in doubt." Don't Don't doubt
[9:27] it anymore, friends. It It's too late to
[9:29] go to doubt now. Let's be real sure of
[9:32] it. Say, "Pray for me, Brother
[9:33] Brandham." And I want to God's gift to
[9:37] the world of Jesus Christ. I I want this
[9:39] to be a real Christmas. I accept the
[9:41] Holy Spirit in my heart that can cradle
[9:44] me through all the storms of life. And
[9:46] someday I can come in his presence with
[9:48] this gift of eternal life. He'll accept
[9:50] me upon those bases. That's the only way
[9:52] he'll do it. Or if you got the right
[9:54] gift tonight, the right kind of an
[9:56] attitude, God, I'll follow you wherever
[9:58] you go. Whatever you say, do, I'll do
[10:00] it. Whatever your word says to me, do
[10:02] it. I'll do it. Yes, sir. I don't care
[10:03] what everybody else says. I'm going to
[10:05] do it because I want your gift. It's
[10:07] life and Christ is the word. If you
[10:09] can't believe all the word and say,
[10:11] "Well, I don't know. I I believe it
[10:13] this, I believe that, but I just can't
[10:15] go this. I can't go that." You're like
[10:17] the 70 at 108. But you can accept all
[10:20] the word and receive Christ in the
[10:22] fullness of his deity and his service
[10:25] and ready to die as he did for you. Then
[10:28] would you just put up your hand with
[10:30] your head bow and say pray for me. God
[10:31] bless you and God bless you. God bless
[10:33] you. God bless you.
[10:39] God bless you. Yes. I see your hands.
[10:41] The Lord bless you. Sure. This little
[10:44] gift of Christ that God sent to the
[10:47] world and identified it by the magi
[10:51] identified it. His own life identified
[10:53] it. His death identified it. His
[10:56] resurrection identified it. Your
[10:59] accepting identified it. And he
[11:01] identifies himself with you that you are
[11:03] his and he is yours. If you're not
[11:07] really see that reaction of the spirit
[11:10] of God working in you this Christmas
[11:12] season, may it come to you now, heavenly
[11:15] father,
[11:18] as we stagger like the on the
[11:22] street.
[11:24] Nobody had any use for the world went
[11:28] right on and their foolish celebration
[11:32] are tonight. Lord, but
[11:36] sometimes we feel like we're trans,
[11:40] but we've accepted a gift.
[11:44] So we pray, Father, that you make us the
[11:46] gift
[11:48] of a life to this dying world. Many here
[11:51] have raised their hands that they want
[11:53] the gift of God that it he had himself
[11:57] give his only begotten son, came down,
[12:01] become a man. And he stooped so low they
[12:03] didn't even he come so low and so humble
[12:06] to it he it didn't even have
[12:10] a bed to be born in
[12:13] a a a cow had to or horse or something
[12:16] had to give its manger
[12:19] step aside an animal human beings that
[12:22] got in so condition there was he he come
[12:25] down in in a manger a little old cave
[12:28] stable on the side of the hill there in
[12:29] Bethlehem him
[12:33] where Harlot's son had founded the
[12:36] little city many years before.
[12:39] And now Lord, we find out that one night
[12:42] a cold night.
[12:45] It was said to him, "Rabbi, we want to
[12:47] go home with you tonight."
[12:50] And he said, "Well, now the birds, they
[12:52] have nest and and the foxes have den,
[12:54] but I I I don't have a even a place to
[12:57] lay my head.
[13:00] And that's the way they let him die like
[13:02] the on the street.
[13:05] The heavenly father can the Christ the
[13:08] kind the people today see that that is
[13:11] that great gift and many here tonight
[13:13] more than a dozen I guess raised their
[13:15] hands that they wanted to receive the
[13:17] Holy Spirit. May there just like the
[13:20] wise men, maybe none of the rest of the
[13:22] congregation will even see what goes on.
[13:26] And this star, this mystic light passed
[13:29] over the observatories for two years
[13:31] before people even kept time. Then
[13:33] before watches, they kept time for the
[13:35] stars. Nobody, no historian wrote of it.
[13:39] No one, no nothing about it. And yet it
[13:42] was there.
[13:44] These wise men with the appropriate gift
[13:46] was guided right through to it. May that
[13:49] same light come into every heart here
[13:52] tonight that's setting present. It may
[13:54] not be no emotion. It may not be this
[13:57] that and maybe no one else know it just
[13:59] like the wise men but may something so
[14:02] be settled in these men, women, boys and
[14:04] girls hearts tonight that that gift of
[14:06] God will anoint their life that from
[14:09] this night on they'll be changed. They
[14:11] won't be no more like they used to be.
[14:13] They'll be a changed preacher from now
[14:15] on.
[14:17] May they like the wise men turn aside
[14:20] and not go back to the fashions of the
[14:21] world of Herod the king's palace but
[14:24] being warned of God they turned aside.
[14:28] Granted Lord tonight I pray that every
[14:30] wise man boy or girl in here tonight man
[14:33] or woman that's wise enough to turn
[14:36] aside from the things of the world
[14:37] tonight don't go back no more after this
[14:40] day after this this passing of this day
[14:43] and night. No more will they go back to
[14:45] the things of the world. But maybe they
[14:47] be wise and this little mystic voice
[14:49] that caused them to raise their hands
[14:50] and say, "Yes, I want God's gift."
[14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; May that same thing that caused them to
[14:56] raise their hands identify him tonight
[14:58] with his death, burial, and resurrection
[15:00] by giving them the Holy Spirit. May they
[15:02] turn aside.
[15:04] May these women here tonight, Lord, it's
[15:06] had such a hard time to keep from coping
[15:08] with the world. let their hair grow and
[15:11] dress ladylike and take off this makeup
[15:14] and stuff that's artificial. It shows it
[15:16] it kind of identifies them that they're
[15:18] not healthy. They they're there's
[15:20] something wrong. And may tonight this
[15:23] little mystic life, Lord, that caused
[15:25] them to raise their hands. May they say,
[15:27] "Lord, I'm turning aside from the things
[15:29] of the world tonight. These men that
[15:32] hasn't had the the the real something
[15:34] that would talk to their wives and cause
[15:36] them to turn aside and the things that
[15:38] they do. May we all together, Lord, just
[15:40] turn aside tonight, being warned of God
[15:43] by the strange little message of the the
[15:46] light of God that strikes upon our
[15:48] hearts. May we turn aside tonight and
[15:51] and live for you the rest of our days.
[15:53] Go home with you by another way than
[15:57] what we have been traveling. Grant it,
[15:59] Lord. Make us better Christians. a
[16:01] Christian here tonight, Father, that's
[16:03] accepted you and believes on you and
[16:06] they've tried to live a Christian life,
[16:07] but tonight, may they turn aside, may
[16:10] they receive that gift. Oh, God. It's
[16:13] it's a it's a despised way. Women will
[16:16] be called oldfashioned. They'll be
[16:17] called everything. And men will be
[16:19] called fanatics, but we're we're ready,
[16:22] Lord. Uh Holy Spirit, turn us aside
[16:25] right now. Turn me aside, Lord. I I I
[16:28] don't want to even go uh any way that
[16:31] would lead me away from you, Lord. I
[16:33] want to go just the way you had me to
[16:35] go. I want the gift of my heart to be so
[16:38] perfect that it'll identify you, Lord,
[16:40] on earth. That you're not dead. You're
[16:42] living. You're the God of the living,
[16:44] not the God of the dead. The dead is
[16:47] covered all over with flies and
[16:49] blowflies creating germs and and more
[16:52] blowflies. It's like the man takes his
[16:54] first drink, smokes his first cigarette,
[16:56] tells his first lie, goes out on his
[16:59] wife for the first time, or the wife
[17:00] that goes out on the husband or does
[17:02] some things that's wrong just like a
[17:04] blowfly struck them and they they
[17:06] accumulate by the glo and the blows and
[17:09] filth because it's on a dead soul on the
[17:13] inside. Evil spirits glo and one evil
[17:17] spirit caused them to do something else
[17:18] and another come to do something else
[17:20] because they did this. God, may they
[17:22] turn aside and come to life. May they
[17:24] rise and the angels of God come down
[17:26] with the gifts of eternal life, Lord,
[17:29] and go from victory onto victory.
[17:31] Granted, Father, we turn aside tonight
[17:33] from the things of the world and the
[17:35] cares of the world, warned of God that
[17:38] the time is at hand. Jesus is coming
[17:41] back to the earth. And may the great
[17:43] Holy Spirit give us tonight that eternal
[17:46] life that we're looking for. strength
[17:48] that Lord, we're we're just pray that
[17:51] you'll grant these blessings to as we
[17:53] ask them in Jesus Christ's name
[17:57] with our head.
[18:05] Wise men long ago came to that
