[50:02] it is no more I that do it but sin that
[50:08] do all live in me
[50:11] I find then a lord
[50:13] that when I would do good evil is
[50:18] present with me
[50:20] for a delight in the law of God after
[50:24] the inward man
[50:27] but I see another Lord
[50:30] in my members warring against the Lord
[50:34] of my mind
[50:36] and bringing me into captivity
[50:39] to the law of sin which is in my member
[50:44] all wretched men that I am
[50:48] who shall deliver me
[50:50] from the body of this death
[50:54] I find God through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[50:58] so then with my mind I myself
[51:03] serve the Lord of God
[51:07] but with the flesh the Lord of sin
[51:13] let's pray together father
[51:17] we will humble our hearts to the
[51:19] truthness of your word
[51:21] and we need your grace Lord
[51:23] to come and help us Lord
[51:25] help us as we open the unsatchable
[51:28] riches of your truth please speak to our
[51:32] hearts Lord as we will just want to take
[51:34] this thought father and and uh and and
[51:37] kind of for round it up Lord bring it to
[51:40] a place of Father God and then just give
[51:43] your children a sense of direction
[51:44] father not just to read bunch of codes
[51:47] or to read father Lord bunch of
[51:50] scriptures but father God to be able to
[51:53] pick up what the spirit is saying to the
[51:55] church
[51:57] we commit ourselves in your hands now
[51:59] bless us
[52:01] Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord
[52:04] bless you the Lord bless you you came
[52:09] you can have your seed
[52:11] so as you see there is is the house of
[52:14] pharaohs that's that is part three
[52:17] uh
[52:18] that is part three
[52:21] of their taught born of the seed
[52:24] incorruptible
[52:26] so we would we would we were taking uh
[52:29] two laws
[52:31] which of course those uh uh we will call
[52:35] them Lord of nature or Lord of our first
[52:38] birth
[52:39] and uh and the first law that we were
[52:43] thinking sorry I'll take up mine I used
[52:47] to have one mama
[52:49] you know back in church with us uh uh
[52:52] back
[52:54] 1994
[52:55] 95 you know
[52:58] she always said she said brother Wong
[53:00] why do you wear the coat if you will
[53:02] always take it off
[53:06] then why do you wear it
[53:17] says son why were you why are you
[53:19] wearing the code if you always take it
[53:21] off
[53:22] now so
[53:24] the the purpose of this of this subject
[53:28] that we have taken now for about three
[53:30] Sundays
[53:31] is to is to bring us to the place for us
[53:35] to be able to appreciate
[53:37] God's love his grace and his Mercy to us
[53:43] praise the Lord hallelujah
[53:46] you know even before I start this
[53:48] subject I know I was I'm I'm a little
[53:51] bit ahead of myself here and that's how
[53:54] I get everything spoiled but let's let's
[53:56] read this
[53:58] let's read this uh
[54:01] first uh code of mine
[54:03] did I have this one
[54:06] yeah
[54:08] and uh
[54:11] Iman meditation this entire week
[54:15] I was I was listening to 1800
[54:19] preacher
[54:21] and uh and he says something that caught
[54:23] my mind and now I was I you know I was
[54:26] just meditating upon that so I went back
[54:29] and and I decided to to play this
[54:32] message of humble thyself
[54:35] and uh and brother Brandon says yeah now
[54:38] I believe this is truth
[54:41] I believe this is truth
[54:46] with all my heart
[54:48] if there was anything different
[54:51] that I thought was better
[54:54] as certainly
[54:57] first goal I won't ask anybody to go
[55:01] anywhere that
[55:04] ah don't go first
[55:08] to find out whether it is right or not
[55:13] I wouldn't ask any person to take a step
[55:16] in God
[55:18] that are having already made
[55:22] and know that it is truth
[55:27] praise the Lord so he's he's he's
[55:30] speaking on the message this was just
[55:33] few comments he was making brother
[55:35] Olivia was the one that actually
[55:36] preached our service that night but then
[55:39] he's he's taking this talk to be able to
[55:42] show ourselves a form of of leadership a
[55:47] form and and I'm reading that and in my
[55:50] mind I'm looking for
[55:52] uh how is he teaching humbleness in this
[55:58] how is he teaching humbled herself in
[56:00] this
[56:01] and you know Jesus in teaching the the
[56:06] you know one of his last message he
[56:10] preached to the to his church was that
[56:13] evening of communion
[56:16] he took a basin and all of these you
[56:19] know uh guys were looking at him talking
[56:21] a towel he tied around himself and he
[56:25] started watching the affid he came to
[56:26] Peter Peter said no not me you're not
[56:29] going to wash my feet I'm supposed to be
[56:31] the one doing this and Jesus said okay
[56:34] I'll pass by you you don't have no party
[56:36] man I'll do the next person he said well
[56:39] then just wash my whole body now because
[56:41] you know I need to be claimed Jesus said
[56:44] you don't understand what I'm doing and
[56:47] uh and and he he watched the disciples
[56:50] feet and he says you call me your lord
[56:53] and your master
[56:55] and and I've washed your feet and I want
[56:58] you to do the same one to another praise
[57:01] the Lord so Jesus
[57:04] in his way of life he have always
[57:07] learned to teach by example
[57:11] that is one of the most powerful way
[57:14] to teach
[57:16] it's more powerful than explaining
[57:21] it's more powerful than uh uh you know
[57:25] making the people to watch a video or
[57:27] making the people the one of the
[57:29] powerful way
[57:31] to to teach or to lead is by example
[57:37] praise the Lord and for the man or a
[57:40] woman to to be an example in their sense
[57:45] we have to
[57:47] you have to you have to step out of your
[57:49] comfort zone
[57:51] praise the Lord
[57:52] you have to step out of your comfort
[57:54] zone and and as I was thinking about
[57:57] that you know I was just thinking about
[58:01] what we call mystery you know people
[58:04] look at the creation like brother
[58:06] Hillary read the heavens declare the
[58:10] glory of God
[58:11] we wouldn't have known any of that of
[58:15] saying any of the things in the heavens
[58:18] until the self-existing god
[58:23] how to condescend
[58:25] he had to step out of being
[58:28] self-existing
[58:30] he had to step out of being the great
[58:34] internal spirit
[58:37] and he have to
[58:39] condesate humble himself
[58:42] praise the Lord now you see that is the
[58:45] reason why
[58:46] signs will never be able to find God
[58:52] praise the Lord because the one that
[58:55] made the universe
[58:57] never made a universe and stand aside to
[59:02] break
[59:04] praise the Lord
[59:06] when God made the universe he actually
[59:10] identified himself
[59:12] with his creation
[59:15] everything came out of him God did not
[59:18] made something that he had to go and get
[59:21] it from someone he brought it out of him
[59:27] praise the Lord
[59:33] and that is the same thing with the
[59:36] mystery of redemption
[59:39] Paul Paul the great Apostle says great
[59:43] is the mystery of God
[59:45] now when we hear this great is the
[59:47] mystery of God our mind goes to you know
[59:49] God Jesus Is God you know there is no
[59:52] three person those are just curing what
[59:56] is the mystery that Paul said is great
[59:59] God
[1:00:01] became man that's the mystery God humble
[1:00:05] himself
[1:00:07] that is the mystery the mystery is not
[1:00:10] in the theory all you know and you are
[1:00:13] explaining is just the curing
[1:00:17] but the actual mystery was the creator
[1:00:20] of Heaven and Earth
[1:00:23] became lower than angel
[1:00:26] he took the form of a man
[1:00:29] I like the way he said it in Philippines
[1:00:32] God never thought that he were robbing
[1:00:34] himself
[1:00:36] he never taught a robbery
[1:00:40] to become man
[1:00:42] praise the Lord
[1:00:48] are we together
[1:00:51] so brother Branham
[1:00:54] I said I didn't want him to do this but
[1:00:56] I started brother Brandon now is taking
[1:00:59] this
[1:01:01] and he's saying
[1:01:03] I believe that this is the truth he's
[1:01:05] actually referring to the message of the
[1:01:07] owl he says I believe that this is the
[1:01:09] truth with all of my heart if there was
[1:01:12] anything out that I taught better I
[1:01:15] settled it I won't go any word I won't
[1:01:18] ask anybody to go anywhere that I don't
[1:01:21] go first to find out whether it is right
[1:01:24] or not I wouldn't ask any person to make
[1:01:27] a step in God
[1:01:29] praise the Lord
[1:01:30] what is it was the reason of preaching
[1:01:32] water baptism in Jesus name if you are
[1:01:35] not baptized in Jesus name
[1:01:37] praise the Lord
[1:01:38] amen
[1:01:39] in God they are having already made
[1:01:44] in truth and and know that is the truth
[1:01:48] first it must be the word of the Lord
[1:01:51] then I must step and see if it is right
[1:01:54] and then if it is right I can say come
[1:01:58] come on up this way
[1:02:01] C is making a way
[1:02:04] praise the Lord
[1:02:05] Hallelujah
[1:02:07] then he says oh sorry man
[1:02:11] well
[1:02:13] he says now I think any Minister now you
[1:02:17] we can look at this
[1:02:20] from the place of ministry
[1:02:23] but you can take it from a Ministry and
[1:02:26] you can bring it to any form of
[1:02:27] leadership
[1:02:29] whether in your home whether I work any
[1:02:34] form of leadership I think any Minister
[1:02:36] ought to do that or to go first himself
[1:02:40] he's supposed to be a leader
[1:02:43] a leader of people not speaking
[1:02:46] something that he wouldn't put his hand
[1:02:49] on himself we should go and be leaders
[1:02:54] to the people
[1:02:55] praise the Lord
[1:02:57] amen now for us for me to achieve this I
[1:03:03] must humble myself
[1:03:05] praise the Lord
[1:03:08] it's hard to see it if you don't look
[1:03:12] in a constructive way
[1:03:15] praise the Lord
[1:03:18] Hallelujah
[1:03:20] are we together
[1:03:22] now so he there with the place of the
[1:03:25] leader
[1:03:27] he's saying if you will ever be a
[1:03:30] blessing to the people don't just preach
[1:03:32] mistreating preacher you know uh all of
[1:03:35] those things you must be
[1:03:39] a leader by example
[1:03:42] praise the Lord amen amen if you want to
[1:03:45] pray to preach on on faith you must also
[1:03:49] be rising in faith you must be living by
[1:03:51] faith you want to pray uh uh lead the
[1:03:54] people into an atmosphere of prayer you
[1:03:57] must be a prayer Warrior yourself amen
[1:03:59] praise the Lord and and whatever it is
[1:04:03] then he goes ahead and and then uh
[1:04:09] he brings another
[1:04:12] thing into this whole thing of humbling
[1:04:15] yourself so just just follow me and see
[1:04:16] how beautiful it is he said someone was
[1:04:19] Solomon I believe it was my brother back
[1:04:21] there telling me in the story today
[1:04:22] about a man a minister and uh one of his
[1:04:28] congregation he had to walk walk and
[1:04:31] walk he said pastor show the Lord the
[1:04:34] Lord is with you
[1:04:36] he said I can pack the log
[1:04:39] across my back when I go across
[1:04:43] say sure the Lord is with you
[1:04:46] and he went and he done it
[1:04:49] praise the Lord and he said I can park a
[1:04:52] law
[1:04:53] and then uh and and we we borrow a cross
[1:04:58] at the same time sure Pastor the Lord is
[1:05:01] with you your faith can do anything
[1:05:05] he said I can put you in a wheelbarrow
[1:05:10] and and park the Lord
[1:05:14] he said now wait a minute
[1:05:20] and praise the Lord amen
[1:05:22] amen amen
[1:05:24] now we have to we have to see this it
[1:05:26] can be a beautiful story we can read it
[1:05:28] and then we can just miss the point we
[1:05:30] can just miss what the Lord wants to
[1:05:33] teach us here yeah I better ban a few
[1:05:35] paragraphs above he had just finished
[1:05:37] instructing the ministry how to be a
[1:05:40] leader by example you cannot lead the
[1:05:43] people until you are above it's not only
[1:05:47] what you are preaching but it is also uh
[1:05:50] uh uh uh the life that the people are
[1:05:52] seeing the the Consecration and all of
[1:05:55] that then he comes also now to the
[1:05:58] people and turn the story around he says
[1:06:01] now this ministers were saying well you
[1:06:03] know I can walk across the Lord and I
[1:06:05] won't fall the people say well you can
[1:06:07] do it praise the Lord he says well I can
[1:06:09] even carry a wheel Baron across the Lord
[1:06:11] he said praise the Lord shout you can do
[1:06:13] it then he says what I can put you in a
[1:06:16] wheelbarrow and go across the Lord
[1:06:19] gases well with the meaning I'm not sure
[1:06:22] of that
[1:06:23] praise the Lord now you see what is
[1:06:26] happening here is the other uh uh is is
[1:06:30] is is is
[1:06:32] it is just like uh you see it's it's
[1:06:35] this God that is on the stand you know
[1:06:38] that has all the skill of playing the
[1:06:40] game but he's not on the field he's not
[1:06:42] wearing the Jazzy
[1:06:45] he can stay on this on the stand he can
[1:06:47] criticize you know why are you supposed
[1:06:49] to throw the ball that way man enough
[1:06:51] man that's if if I was to coach I got
[1:06:54] that guy out of the field
[1:06:55] but he's not wearing the Jazzy
[1:06:59] now so what brother Branham is trying to
[1:07:01] bring us here to the place to understand
[1:07:03] is the other uh uh uh you know you we
[1:07:07] you can stand a fight and you you can
[1:07:09] say Amen to the word you can you can say
[1:07:12] I think that was a good salmon you know
[1:07:14] and and uh really I really enjoyed the
[1:07:17] message today you know and and it was
[1:07:19] wonderful but uh for God it's it's not
[1:07:23] enough
[1:07:26] praise the Lord
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:29] it's not just this is not just a theater
[1:07:33] where we have you to come and sit and we
[1:07:37] just here to play some comedy or make
[1:07:40] you laugh or or play your favorite joke
[1:07:42] or make your favorite statement
[1:07:45] this is a place where God
[1:07:51] have God alive for a man in his hands
[1:07:55] that he have trusted your life
[1:08:00] to the ministry
[1:08:04] praise the Lord
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:11] so it is it is me taking you across the
[1:08:14] Lord
[1:08:17] I can force you to get in a wheelbarrow
[1:08:20] I won't force you
[1:08:22] if you believe that I can do it then
[1:08:24] step in
[1:08:28] praise the Lord amen if you believe that
[1:08:32] I can do it
[1:08:33] then stepping
[1:08:37] and with your confidence in my
[1:08:40] notability to get across the Lord and
[1:08:44] with me because I have gone there and
[1:08:47] come back
[1:08:50] praise the Lord
[1:08:52] we can make it across together
[1:08:58] are we together
[1:09:02] when you think about it
[1:09:04] and you think that brother Brandon will
[1:09:06] preach
[1:09:09] now the sales
[1:09:13] and the opening of the seals he will
[1:09:15] preach the message
[1:09:16] God is simplicity
[1:09:19] God hate
[1:09:23] and reveal in simplicity
[1:09:27] that's where the secret of God is
[1:09:31] is in humbleness
[1:09:35] that's word The Secret Of God is
[1:09:41] that's where the power of God is
[1:09:46] that's where the riches of his grace is
[1:09:50] is when we can humble our
[1:09:53] word of the Lord
[1:09:56] are we together
[1:09:58] praise the Lord
[1:10:01] now so this subject that we've been
[1:10:03] dealing with yeah
[1:10:06] uh uh is uh it's a subject that that I
[1:10:12] took
[1:10:13] and uh
[1:10:16] to be able to appreciate
[1:10:19] uh
[1:10:25] seeing how
[1:10:28] the Old Testament
[1:10:30] being the shadow of good things to come
[1:10:34] but he also held prophecies I mean they
[1:10:37] are just Rich prophecies in it and what
[1:10:39] we've been dealing with uh these two
[1:10:42] Services we've been taking these two
[1:10:44] laws they are they had to do with uh
[1:10:47] with with us as humans we every one of
[1:10:50] us
[1:10:51] honor these two laws just like Paul said
[1:10:54] in Romans chapter 8 you have to remember
[1:10:57] that the apostates in Romans chapter 8
[1:11:00] that we have just read
[1:11:02] the Apostle Paul says I know Romans
[1:11:05] chapter 7 sorry sorry I'm sorry Romans
[1:11:08] chapter seven I have in chapter eight
[1:11:10] open before me and he says for I know
[1:11:13] that in me
[1:11:15] that is my flesh
[1:11:18] no good thing
[1:11:20] praise the Lord
[1:11:22] Paul never said in me there is no good
[1:11:25] thing
[1:11:28] praise the Lord that's not what he said
[1:11:31] I hope that's not what you read
[1:11:37] Paul never said in me there is no good
[1:11:40] thing
[1:11:43] I hope that's not what you read
[1:11:46] I hope that's not the mind that you are
[1:11:48] going out of here with Paul said in me
[1:11:51] that is my flesh
[1:11:55] there is no good thing
[1:12:02] he says in me that is to say this flesh
[1:12:07] of mine
[1:12:09] but you are not just your flesh
[1:12:12] you are more than just a flesh
[1:12:19] you have a soul
[1:12:25] praise the Lord
[1:12:28] so a poor how the mindset that you were
[1:12:32] completely condemned and nothing good
[1:12:34] can come from out of you he will not be
[1:12:37] precise to say Amy that is to say My
[1:12:41] Flesh
[1:12:42] he will have said Amy there is no good
[1:12:45] thing that is not what he said he said
[1:12:47] he mean that is to say My Flesh
[1:12:51] praise the Lord
[1:12:52] I hope that was what you read
[1:12:56] amen
[1:13:00] so Paul
[1:13:03] saying that man he's he's giving us an
[1:13:06] idea
[1:13:09] that there is a treasure here somewhere
[1:13:11] there
[1:13:14] is goodness
[1:13:17] praise the Lord amen amen
[1:13:22] you know the Bible says when God started
[1:13:25] creating everything he ended his
[1:13:28] creation by saying this was good
[1:13:35] when he made man he says it was very
[1:13:39] good
[1:13:40] praise the Lord
[1:13:42] every man that God May Under the Sun
[1:13:45] every man
[1:13:48] it's man
[1:13:50] with some goodness in
[1:13:52] foreign
[1:13:55] I've always believed that
[1:13:58] when Jesus says I will make you Fishers
[1:14:01] of Men is for you to go and fish out the
[1:14:05] good
[1:14:06] that is a man
[1:14:10] praise the Lord
[1:14:12] because many men are living with good
[1:14:14] potentials
[1:14:16] but they don't know they have it
[1:14:18] because they are just so dominated with
[1:14:21] uh with an evil or bringing and they are
[1:14:24] consumed with the elements of their
[1:14:26] flesh their anger and and on and they
[1:14:29] are lost in their drunkenness that they
[1:14:31] don't even see the good that is in them
[1:14:40] praise the Lord
[1:14:42] that's what the gospel net is for
[1:14:46] the gospel net is sent out
[1:14:49] to be able to fish in you
[1:14:55] the goodness
[1:14:58] God
[1:15:01] after all you are not just so bad
[1:15:06] glory be to God Amen
[1:15:11] after all you are not just so bad
[1:15:16] because I can see that Grace on your
[1:15:18] face you say man your smile can tell me
[1:15:21] that you are not just so bad
[1:15:23] praise the Lord
[1:15:25] amen and that's what I I was trusting
[1:15:29] the grace of God for us to do for us to
[1:15:32] be able to go out and fish together
[1:15:35] where we can go and travel
[1:15:38] and being able to see how the grace of
[1:15:41] God can be able to to bring us to the
[1:15:43] place and realize the hidden treasure
[1:15:49] just like Paul says he says he has
[1:15:51] fought Heavenly treasure
[1:15:54] in acting vessels
[1:16:02] praise the Lord
[1:16:03] now if we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:16:09] which we are by the grace of God and we
[1:16:13] know that God
[1:16:14] from the foundation of the word he
[1:16:17] predestinated us
[1:16:19] and we know that there is a
[1:16:21] predestinated sea that was placed in our
[1:16:24] soul
[1:16:26] then no matter
[1:16:28] how much evil our flesh is consumed in
[1:16:34] us down in our soul there is something
[1:16:37] good
[1:16:40] praise the Lord
[1:16:44] some good in you God by his grace would
[1:16:48] he have brought Grace and and the
[1:16:51] message of Salvation across your path
[1:16:56] so that's what I want us
[1:16:58] to be able to stand it that's where my
[1:17:00] mind is
[1:17:02] because throughout the ages people you
[1:17:06] know uh uh uh struggle you know uh the
[1:17:10] the Holiness movement you know uh uh the
[1:17:13] the the you know when when God started
[1:17:15] during the time of the Reformation when
[1:17:18] when when Luther and the rest of them
[1:17:20] came out preaching that Josh Chalet by
[1:17:22] faith you know they were just standing
[1:17:25] on Thy word against the Catholic system
[1:17:29] praise the Lord
[1:17:30] but the grace to be able to rise above
[1:17:34] the the the the the desire of of of of
[1:17:37] habits in their life what's not there
[1:17:40] Ludo was preaching that George shall lay
[1:17:42] by faith he will stay on his pipe
[1:17:45] nothing in him was condemning him to
[1:17:47] smoke a pipe
[1:17:50] but you will see it and realize that
[1:17:52] that was the grace of God in that hour
[1:17:56] amen that was the knowledge of God but
[1:17:59] then when John Wesley came out and
[1:18:01] started preaching a message of
[1:18:03] sanctification the church had to move in
[1:18:07] a higher walk with God
[1:18:09] praise the Lord
[1:18:12] Hallelujah
[1:18:15] and then when the uh uh the the the the
[1:18:18] the the the Pentecostal Revival came in
[1:18:21] and the gates will break upon the people
[1:18:23] and uh uh God has moved the church to a
[1:18:27] life of sanctification where he can now
[1:18:31] start dealing with the people but you
[1:18:32] see what happened here is that the
[1:18:34] people started majoring on the Mana
[1:18:39] and they talk speaking in tongues as a
[1:18:42] as an Evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:45] praise the Lord
[1:18:46] Hallelujah now then or down through the
[1:18:51] the church ages
[1:18:53] there is there is all of these
[1:18:55] geological conflict
[1:19:00] word people says as as long as I mean
[1:19:05] you have you have you have given your
[1:19:07] heart some says you know uh uh uh we are
[1:19:11] saved by faith our confession in the
[1:19:13] Lord Jesus Christ you confess the you
[1:19:15] know that Jesus is your lord like Paul
[1:19:17] says there in Romans and he accepted in
[1:19:20] his heart you know that's that's what
[1:19:21] man can do
[1:19:24] and they stop right there
[1:19:26] praise the Lord amen hallelujah as long
[1:19:29] as he has they have confessed the Lord
[1:19:31] Jesus as their savior you know uh uh it
[1:19:35] does not bother them what what any kind
[1:19:37] of a life delay
[1:19:40] then uh uh uh another group holds to the
[1:19:45] father that I know you cannot be living
[1:19:47] in sin you know and God cleanse your
[1:19:48] life and all of that and and as a church
[1:19:51] move on in in all of those places many
[1:19:54] people came to the place and say so well
[1:19:56] you know as when if you have the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost you are born again you know the
[1:20:01] spirit of God come upon you the nature
[1:20:03] of sin sees completely
[1:20:07] praise the Lord
[1:20:09] and you have many men even preachers
[1:20:12] they have thrown their Bible down
[1:20:15] because the law of the Lord they tried
[1:20:18] to win soul for Christ and all of that
[1:20:20] but they are never understood these two
[1:20:23] law that Paul says that war in the human
[1:20:27] body
[1:20:28] they have never understood
[1:20:32] praise the Lord
[1:20:36] they have never been able to understand
[1:20:38] it because it looks like Lord you you
[1:20:40] promise when you give me the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] they're fired of the Holy Ghost will
[1:20:44] come down and they get excited for the Y
[1:20:47] to receive the holy boy the child the
[1:20:48] speaking don't whatever it is man after
[1:20:51] a little while to realize that the
[1:20:54] temperature power is still around
[1:20:58] praise the Lord
[1:21:01] Lord that's why I received the Holy
[1:21:03] Ghost what are these thoughts keeps
[1:21:04] coming back to my mind
[1:21:07] Lord I thought I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:21:11] who am I having these desires
[1:21:14] they have never understood the two Lords
[1:21:19] that wall in our members
[1:21:24] praise the Lord
[1:21:26] are we together
[1:21:30] and there is not and there is if there
[1:21:32] is like Paul says here I want to call
[1:21:35] the Apostle Paul very well
[1:21:37] for I know that amen that is to say My
[1:21:40] Flesh dwelleth no good things if there
[1:21:43] is nothing good
[1:21:45] that dwelling in my flesh then there is
[1:21:48] nothing of My Flesh that God wants
[1:21:54] heard me
[1:21:56] praise the Lord now there is nothing of
[1:21:59] My Flesh and there is nothing good that
[1:22:01] dwelleth in my flesh there is nothing of
[1:22:03] My Flesh what God wants is that thing
[1:22:06] that comes out of my soul yes amen
[1:22:13] are we together
[1:22:15] and then so I thought that
[1:22:18] the house of pharaohs who be what will
[1:22:21] give us a picture
[1:22:25] and we know that that prophecy came out
[1:22:28] of Ruth chapter four
[1:22:30] when Ruth gave birth
[1:22:34] to Obed
[1:22:36] who became the father
[1:22:39] of Jesse and Jesse became the father of
[1:22:42] David
[1:22:44] when she gave birth
[1:22:50] the heavens of Ezra said unto us let
[1:22:53] your house be like the house of pharaohs
[1:22:58] and we've realized that right on the
[1:23:01] deer in Luke Chapter I mean Ruth chapter
[1:23:03] four the last few verses came the
[1:23:06] generation of pharaohs and it broke 10th
[1:23:10] Generation
[1:23:11] and and he end on David
[1:23:14] so we took that as a type
[1:23:18] honor the Lord of God
[1:23:20] that says
[1:23:23] no bastard child we enter the
[1:23:27] congregation of the Lord until after
[1:23:30] 10th Generation
[1:23:33] praise the Lord amen
[1:23:35] which of course the act of Judah and
[1:23:38] tema that the Bible recalled Judah slept
[1:23:42] with his own daughter-in-law that was an
[1:23:45] abominable Act
[1:23:46] praise the Lord
[1:23:48] and then by the word of God there is
[1:23:51] there is there is uh that child was was
[1:23:55] supposed to be an adulterous and a
[1:23:57] bastard child
[1:24:00] but it was not only pharaohs that was
[1:24:02] born
[1:24:06] there was also Sarah that was born
[1:24:09] and according to the picture in Genesis
[1:24:11] chapter 38
[1:24:13] zero was the one that came out first and
[1:24:16] the male wife put a record around his
[1:24:19] hand and said this is the first
[1:24:21] and we identified that as our first
[1:24:23] birth
[1:24:26] praise the Lord
[1:24:28] amen
[1:24:30] but then when he placed his hand back
[1:24:32] and then suddenly surprisingly to the
[1:24:34] male one Pharaoh's breakfast
[1:24:37] how did he do it
[1:24:41] how
[1:24:43] how did this try came out
[1:24:48] praise the Lord
[1:24:51] are we together
[1:24:54] so he was named pharah's main breaks
[1:24:56] forth it means overcome
[1:25:04] are we together
[1:25:07] and they'll represent our second birth
[1:25:12] praise the Lord because our our
[1:25:14] challenge every one of us here in this
[1:25:17] building no one high on the calendar
[1:25:20] when they were going to give their life
[1:25:22] to Christ
[1:25:23] who placed it on the calendar
[1:25:26] who had it on the calendar that this
[1:25:28] year this month I will give my life to
[1:25:30] cry I will start serving God
[1:25:34] praise the Lord amen amen when God met
[1:25:37] you it was a breakfast
[1:25:41] praise the Lord
[1:25:43] it was something
[1:25:47] it was something that that rerouted all
[1:25:50] your plans
[1:25:53] so the second birth
[1:25:55] dominate the first book is surprised the
[1:25:58] first birth

[1:28:36] for you glory be to God
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:40] Hallelujah the Saints under the altar

[1:28:53] are crying how long for they are all the
[1:28:55] things they are crying for he says they
[1:28:58] are crying because uh man was never made
[1:29:02] to be in that state
[1:29:06] that was not a feminist State that's a
[1:29:08] temporary state
[1:29:11] praise the lord we were never made to be
[1:29:14] spirit and we will never be spirit
[1:29:18] praise the Lord
[1:29:19] we were made to be
[1:29:21] humans
[1:29:26] we were not made to be angels
[1:29:30] so an invisible dwelling is not it's not
[1:29:34] your place
[1:29:37] praise the Lord so don't be here and you
[1:29:40] want to be invisible
[1:29:50] we will ever be visible right
[1:29:55] that's what I said it's another subject
[1:29:57] so right around here it's going to take
[1:29:59] us through he's going to take us through
[1:30:01] uh how God there with the Earth the
[1:30:04] first baptism or water Noah's day Jesus
[1:30:07] the blood the fire that will come and
[1:30:09] consume the Earth he's taking us through
[1:30:11] all of that we will not will not go
[1:30:13] through all of that I just have few
[1:30:15] quotes where I want to grab your
[1:30:16] attention so we can get right back to
[1:30:18] our subject that we were not we would
[1:30:21] not get lost now you have to realize now
[1:30:22] we're talking about the house of
[1:30:25] pharaohs we are talking about our
[1:30:28] predestination we are talking about uh
[1:30:31] uh uh uh uh and and also zero we we talk
[1:30:35] about Zara last last uh Sunday we saw
[1:30:38] how you know uh uh when Akon stole the
[1:30:42] Babylonian government
[1:30:45] when he stole the babylona Garment and
[1:30:47] Joshua called him out by the Holy Spirit
[1:30:49] the Bible make us to know that he came
[1:30:52] from from Judah he came his grandfather
[1:30:56] was Zera now so four generations we we
[1:31:00] counted it last week and the Bible said
[1:31:02] that God will visit the iniquity of the
[1:31:05] fathers to the fourth and the fifth
[1:31:08] generation so that iniquity that Jacob
[1:31:11] did was visited in Zera
[1:31:14] no that iniquity that brought for Zera
[1:31:17] was visited in Aiken
[1:31:20] so what the Bible set out for us to see
[1:31:23] is that econ his whole entire household
[1:31:27] was burned
[1:31:30] praise the Lord
[1:31:32] because that is what the the that is
[1:31:35] what the Holy Spirit does when when the
[1:31:38] Holy Ghost comes
[1:31:40] these were the curse
[1:31:43] and these were the curse that run down
[1:31:45] from our Parish
[1:31:49] the curse that was running down from
[1:31:52] Zara was there with in akan
[1:31:57] are we together
[1:32:00] so when the Holy Ghost deal with the
[1:32:02] curse it do not burn you it burned the
[1:32:05] nature of sea
[1:32:07] but your body Remains the Same
[1:32:10] amen your body Remains the Same
[1:32:14] these were the nature of seeing your
[1:32:17] body Remains the Same and when your body
[1:32:19] Remains the Same it do not change what
[1:32:22] Paul says here it's not now that because
[1:32:24] you have received the Holy Ghost you
[1:32:26] will come and change your scripture and
[1:32:28] say in my flesh dwell a good thing no
[1:32:31] in your flesh dwelling no good thing
[1:32:36] even though the nature of sin is dealt
[1:32:40] with
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:43] but your body Remains the Same
[1:32:49] have I lost you somewhere
[1:32:51] are we together
[1:32:55] now you see now is the Sea of pharaohs
[1:32:59] is that Incorruptible scene now which is
[1:33:02] the word of God that starts to Spring
[1:33:04] out and all it can do is to bring your
[1:33:07] body on a suggestion amen is to come
[1:33:10] celebrate your body on a suggestion and
[1:33:13] so constantly remind you that in your
[1:33:16] flesh there is no good thing don't rely
[1:33:18] on your flesh don't rely on your ability
[1:33:20] continue humbling yourself to the word
[1:33:23] of God until you receive your body
[1:33:25] change
[1:33:31] praise the Lord
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:35] amen brought around tell us of a story
[1:33:37] of a young girl that gave her life to
[1:33:39] God
[1:33:41] and the prophet of God says he went
[1:33:43] there pray for that gift and and and and
[1:33:46] and the demon left her like a bat
[1:33:49] throw out of her
[1:33:54] and as she thought she was saying
[1:33:57] and she was safe
[1:34:00] and she want to testify to people that
[1:34:03] she was safe
[1:34:04] and she found herself in the same Club
[1:34:06] where she used to go and dance
[1:34:09] she wanted to leave people to Christ
[1:34:12] but when she get there before she
[1:34:13] realized she was on the floor dancing
[1:34:15] why because in your flesh
[1:34:18] there is no good thing
[1:34:24] praise the Lord
[1:34:28] so it is not how close you get to sin
[1:34:30] without sining the prophet of God says
[1:34:33] it's how far you can see it and stay
[1:34:36] away from it
[1:34:42] praise the Lord is how far you can see
[1:34:45] it and stay away from it because in your
[1:34:47] flesh
[1:34:49] there is what
[1:34:51] oh don't say in a sorrowful way say it
[1:34:53] like you mean it say it like you believe
[1:34:55] it if you don't believe it don't say it
[1:34:59] but if you believe it then say it like
[1:35:01] you believe it
[1:35:02] in your flesh there is not what no no
[1:35:05] good thing
[1:35:09] about your religious people have popped
[1:35:12] they have made a disgrace of the grace
[1:35:14] of God
[1:35:18] why because they were trusting in their
[1:35:20] flesh or I was at the meeting of our
[1:35:22] honor the spirit Our God baptized with
[1:35:24] the Holy Ghost that is in your soul you
[1:35:26] have nothing to do with his flesh

[1:35:31] will live a wrong life
[1:35:35] will have the rest of your life to
[1:35:44] me now so brother will take us here

[1:37:17] why because unbelief is what produce
[1:37:20] your flesh
[1:37:23] is what produced this King this flesh
[1:37:27] the cells in this body
[1:37:32] that's the reason why evil thoughts lost
[1:37:34] our mind all the time
[1:37:37] that's why you get sick
[1:37:39] that's why you get hungry why because
[1:37:41] unbelief is this is the product of
[1:37:44] unbelief
[1:37:46] this is the product of unbelief
[1:37:53] praise the Lord
[1:37:55] that's the reason why a prophet will
[1:37:57] pray for the person in the prayer line
[1:37:59] on a vision he will say they are healed
[1:38:02] but why unbelievers keep giving them a
[1:38:05] symptom to come back in the prayer line
[1:38:09] on a vision you are healed by the word
[1:38:12] of God by his strength you are healed
[1:38:14] amen praise the Lord your flesh don't
[1:38:17] believe that it's your faith that lost
[1:38:20] from your soul that holds to Thy Word
[1:38:23] until healing is manifested in your body
[1:38:31] are we together
[1:38:35] so he says you can repent for what Adam
[1:38:38] have done
[1:38:42] you never done it
[1:38:44] I don't did
[1:38:46] you just get forgiveness
[1:38:49] for what you have done
[1:38:53] this is a very profound statement
[1:39:01] this is a very profound statement
[1:39:04] for you to think that you will eradicate
[1:39:07] get rid of unbelief
[1:39:10] you will never think and even thought
[1:39:12] again
[1:39:13] you will never struggle with a habit in
[1:39:15] your life
[1:39:16] it's a lie from the Devil
[1:39:20] that's never preach it
[1:39:22] the prophet of God never preach it
[1:39:26] praise the Lord
[1:39:27] that is the reason why Canada land do
[1:39:30] not represent Heaven Cana land is a
[1:39:33] constant fight
[1:39:35] the land of Canaan they fought
[1:39:37] constantly
[1:39:38] and when we come into our promise we
[1:39:41] have to fight constantly we have to
[1:39:43] fight every devil from our ground I have
[1:39:46] to possess this body keep Everlasting
[1:39:49] Spirit every live tongue every evil
[1:39:52] imagination you have to fight them
[1:39:54] constantly
[1:40:06] he says you just get forgiving for what
[1:40:09] you have done they're all nature I want
[1:40:12] us to read that together
[1:40:14] they are all nature

[1:43:27] that's what causing it
[1:43:31] is this fellow he says what is happening
[1:43:34] here is that this fellow is the one that
[1:43:38] is producing malice hatred and envy

[1:44:16] it down here so he make us to see that
[1:44:19] this guy here has lost long-suffering
[1:44:22] and joy and because of his presence that
[1:44:25] represents the Holy Ghost that's what is

[1:45:04] you ask or you are forgiving of your sin
[1:45:09] you have only done this
[1:45:13] taking that away
[1:45:17] praise the Lord amen but the thing that
[1:45:21] made you do it is still there
[1:45:25] that's the all root of evil
[1:45:29] it's filthy
[1:45:30] notice the end you repent and you are
[1:45:33] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:35] Christ that he forgive you of your sins
[1:45:40] praise the Lord amen but the thing that
[1:45:43] make you do it the thing that make you
[1:45:46] do it this guy
[1:45:48] is still there
[1:45:51] amen amen
[1:45:56] so if it is still there what happened
[1:45:59] there is the other uh uh he will
[1:46:03] constantly create the same old desire
[1:46:08] praise the Lord
[1:46:09] then he says the second secondly comes
[1:46:12] sanctification is set your mind in order
[1:46:17] it sets your mind in order for holiness
[1:46:23] which means living a clean life
[1:46:27] it sets your mind it sets your spirit
[1:46:32] it gives you a desire to start hitting
[1:46:36] wrong things
[1:46:40] praise the Lord
[1:46:41] amen
[1:46:44] you feel bad when you think talks that
[1:46:46] you should not think or or or or feeling
[1:46:49] you you just feedback
[1:47:01] taking the word sanification is a
[1:47:03] compound Greek word which means cleans
[1:47:05] and set aside for service
[1:47:09] then the nest comes the Baptist in the
[1:47:13] fire and the Holy Ghost
[1:47:15] that God my door in US
[1:47:19] the fire of God cleans our heart from
[1:47:23] sin
[1:47:24] praise the Lord
[1:47:25] and both the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:47:29] praise the Lord so what is happening
[1:47:31] here now is that the fire comes and
[1:47:34] burned this guy
[1:47:36] praise the Lord
[1:47:38] amen amen and brings this God within
[1:47:44] praise the Lord the fire don't burn your
[1:47:47] heart
[1:47:49] it burns the serpent
[1:47:52] praise the Lord
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:55] it's almost like
[1:47:58] instead of chapter 3 when Moses saw the
[1:48:01] Bush on fire what attract Moses was not
[1:48:04] just the fire it was because the leaves
[1:48:07] were not burning
[1:48:10] that was that was that was what Drew him
[1:48:13] now in his curiousness while the tree on
[1:48:15] fire by the bush is not burning and
[1:48:18] that's the same thing there is that same
[1:48:20] fire that was in the burning bush that
[1:48:22] comes into you
[1:48:24] it burns this thing out
[1:48:30] praise the Lord amen why you are still
[1:48:32] alive you are not burned yet
[1:48:35] amen it burns this thing out
[1:48:38] and then the dwarf Wishes the Holy Ghost
[1:48:42] flies in
[1:48:48] are we together
[1:48:52] now
[1:48:53] there is something here uh there is
[1:48:57] there is there is to for us to be able
[1:48:59] to understand I know many of you has you
[1:49:01] know uh you you are familiar with with
[1:49:04] this but where I want to bring us to
[1:49:06] here now is for you for us to see and
[1:49:09] appreciate what is happening because of
[1:49:13] these two laws that Paul has identified
[1:49:16] yet just like I said when you receive
[1:49:18] the Holy Ghost in you does not means
[1:49:21] that now there is good thing in your no
[1:49:24] there is no good thing in your flesh
[1:49:26] what happened here is that
[1:49:29] when the Holy Ghost comes in Burnout
[1:49:32] that
[1:49:34] what happened is that the nature of sin
[1:49:38] leaves the place of authority
[1:49:43] and a guest to the place of influence
[1:49:47] right
[1:49:49] they stay there to influence you
[1:49:54] praise the Lord
[1:49:55] but it is not it is not having Authority
[1:49:59] residents
[1:50:02] he stayed there to tempt you
[1:50:05] to whisper to you
[1:50:07] to make you doubt but what is dwelling
[1:50:10] in your heart greater is he that is in
[1:50:13] you
[1:50:15] the he that is in the world
[1:50:21] to praise the Lord
[1:50:22] so you see when the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:50:25] burns that desire what is happening it
[1:50:28] becomes the house of Akon
[1:50:31] the sin of our parents that have come
[1:50:34] down four generations the Holy Ghost
[1:50:36] comes and burn it
[1:50:42] okay amen
[1:50:44] why so the house
[1:50:48] of pharaohs or the seed of pharaohs the
[1:50:52] overcoming sea can be able to Spring
[1:50:54] forth
[1:50:59] are we together amen
[1:51:02] are you seeing the picture
[1:51:04] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:51:07] you cannot labor
[1:51:11] Carefree careless Christian Life no you
[1:51:14] have to be on your God
[1:51:16] because uh uh uh the enemy the devil
[1:51:19] your adversary is moving around like a
[1:51:21] Rollie lion
[1:51:22] seeking for who to do
[1:51:31] that nature leads from the place of
[1:51:34] authority it no longer have dominion
[1:51:36] over your life
[1:51:38] but it moves to the place of influence
[1:51:42] praise the Lord
[1:51:44] amen it will stay harbored around your
[1:51:46] mind to bring nasty thoughts to you
[1:51:50] it can remind you of your past
[1:51:53] and when you do her in the past what
[1:51:55] happened it starts to give you feeling
[1:51:57] of the past
[1:52:02] it's in a place of influence
[1:52:04] and just want to get your attention
[1:52:08] praise the Lord
[1:52:09] amen if you can give your attention and
[1:52:12] just get you to dwell in the past and in
[1:52:15] all the ugliness of the past then what
[1:52:18] does it create condemnation in your
[1:52:19] heart
[1:52:22] then you have condemnation in your heart
[1:52:24] you cannot have faith anymore to stay on
[1:52:26] the promised world
[1:52:29] praise the Lord
[1:52:31] now if you don't understand this
[1:52:35] what happened there is that you say
[1:52:39] God
[1:52:41] that's why I had the Holy Ghost
[1:52:44] this is the thing that will make the
[1:52:46] church to believe that you can lose the
[1:52:48] Holy Ghost you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:52:50] you can lose the holy God you can never
[1:52:51] lose the Holy Ghost
[1:52:59] because the prophet of God says it burns
[1:53:02] the desire of sin
[1:53:06] he says if you still have the desire you
[1:53:09] need to go to the altar
[1:53:14] praise the Lord
[1:53:15] amen having a desire and being tempted
[1:53:19] is to
[1:53:21] do amen
[1:53:27] praise the Lord amen
[1:53:31] young people just being in church don't
[1:53:33] burn that guy out
[1:53:34] you need an experience
[1:53:37] just being in church does not burn that
[1:53:40] guy out
[1:53:42] you need a birth
[1:53:44] amen
[1:53:46] you need to experience the fire of God
[1:53:48] consuming your life
[1:53:54] don't just hold on to your church
[1:53:55] membership no
[1:53:59] say God I need you
[1:54:02] amen
[1:54:02] I need that nature of sin to be burned
[1:54:07] praise the Lord
[1:54:09] Hallelujah you know brother Brown says
[1:54:11] you know you can you can I mean people
[1:54:13] can deceive themselves that they have
[1:54:14] the Holy Ghost when really they know
[1:54:17] down there that's that secondly stay
[1:54:19] there
[1:54:22] the desire of of of of of the things of
[1:54:25] the word
[1:54:32] are we together
[1:54:35] now so brother Brown will take this let
[1:54:37] me let me see if I can do this here
[1:54:39] quickly
[1:54:44] then he goes here he takes he takes this
[1:54:47] this story of this Indian man
[1:54:51] praise the Lord
[1:54:57] you know while I was telling this
[1:54:59] subject
[1:55:00] I was looking for
[1:55:02] I was looking for where to base a
[1:55:04] certain testimony
[1:55:06] and I couldn't I really couldn't find uh
[1:55:09] I was trying to find a direct direct
[1:55:11] code Brandon and uh uh
[1:55:15] so then I I bumped into the the Indian
[1:55:19] chief you know Broadband I talked about
[1:55:21] his model being his mother is uh uh you
[1:55:24] know an Indian so right from small he
[1:55:28] had a desire to go Western and all that
[1:55:31] and and then at the opening of the sea
[1:55:33] there's a there's a vision that came
[1:55:34] with better band was dressed like an
[1:55:36] alien chief and and there's there's a
[1:55:39] whole lot we can go into there but uh so
[1:55:42] I was looking into all of that so I just
[1:55:43] got this one to to just add to our
[1:55:46] thoughts here we are about closing so
[1:55:48] bear band says like the Indian was one
[1:55:51] time that got safe
[1:55:54] how are you getting along Chief say well
[1:55:57] since I got saved there's two dogs in me
[1:56:02] and said one white dog and one black and
[1:56:06] one black
[1:56:07] and a white dog
[1:56:09] wants me to do right
[1:56:12] and the black dog wants me to do wrong
[1:56:14] praise the lord we all have failed the
[1:56:18] same
[1:56:19] amen the Indian is saying it's too dark
[1:56:22] the other person well we normally say my
[1:56:24] other heart say
[1:56:26] my one heart say I shouldn't do it my
[1:56:28] other heart see my other heart was
[1:56:30] telling me to do it so it's the same
[1:56:31] thing that the Indian chief is talking
[1:56:33] about
[1:56:36] say they are fighting all the time he
[1:56:39] said how do you get along which one way
[1:56:43] in Chief he says it depends on which one
[1:56:46] Chief is the most amen
[1:56:51] praise the lord well that's it if you
[1:56:54] are going to listen
[1:56:55] to reason you will always have this this
[1:57:00] fellow conquering
[1:57:02] but if you will listen to the certain
[1:57:04] sound God's word working in your heart
[1:57:08] you will conquer the other one
[1:57:12] praise the Lord so he's bringing us
[1:57:14] right back again to Romans chapter 7.
[1:57:17] Paul is identifying there in our members
[1:57:20] lie these two laws
[1:57:23] one is the lord of the flesh
[1:57:28] it's a place of influence
[1:57:31] you get it in the wrong atmosphere you
[1:57:33] will feel the wrong spirit
[1:57:38] praise the Lord
[1:57:40] amen
[1:57:47] remember Brown will take this or the uh
[1:57:50] story this also about an Indian

[1:58:07] saying him by Nature you see one of them
[1:58:11] pressure Builder he's identifying his
[1:58:14] nature
[1:58:18] I was hunting with the Indian and I

[1:58:24] egg of the mountain and I started around

[2:00:54] amen but man here is preaching letting
[2:00:58] all the pressure he's talking about how
[2:01:01] we put ourselves under pressure we allow
[2:01:05] pressure to build in our minds and
[2:01:08] pressure for for unnecessary things and
[2:01:10] we get ourselves so much Under Pressure
[2:01:13] until we become so nervous
[2:01:22] whatever you're looking for in this
[2:01:24] world was here before you got here
[2:01:28] just like that air was on the mountain
[2:01:31] but he's the Indians said he was born
[2:01:33] there that's where he lived
[2:01:35] you don't have no other place to go
[2:01:38] so slow down
[2:01:43] praise the Lord
[2:01:45] amen
[2:01:47] whatever you know that is that is that
[2:01:50] is that is trying to overtake us and
[2:01:52] putting you under pressure you have to
[2:01:54] realize it was here before you got here
[2:02:08] and because we get so much honor
[2:02:10] pressure
[2:02:11] we don't realize when we have thrown
[2:02:14] ourselves into a wrong atmosphere
[2:02:20] the negative things of the word and
[2:02:22] negative things are of the media and all
[2:02:24] of those things we allow them to put so
[2:02:26] much pressure on us and brother Branham
[2:02:29] identified those pressure as demon
[2:02:31] powers
[2:02:33] that is upon the Earth
[2:02:46] praise the Lord
[2:02:49] all you are is child of God you are a
[2:02:51] daughter of God you are a son of God the
[2:02:54] grace of God have come to you the Lord
[2:02:55] is dealing with your life but you have
[2:02:57] to realize he still have a place of
[2:03:00] influence
[2:03:01] all he needs to do is to get you in the
[2:03:04] wrong atmospheres
[2:03:07] praise the Lord
[2:03:08] he had to get you in the wrong
[2:03:10] atmosphere he will make you to
[2:03:12] disbelieve the day you give your life to
[2:03:14] God
[2:03:18] all of these people preachers that
[2:03:21] preach this message and women that live
[2:03:23] holy life girls that walk to the altar
[2:03:26] as a virgin the man that the military
[2:03:28] was the first man that gave them their
[2:03:30] case
[2:03:31] but now they're turning their back on
[2:03:33] the very thing that gave them virtue and
[2:03:35] Grace why because they got themselves
[2:03:37] into the wrong atmosphere
[2:03:42] instead of reading the word of God and
[2:03:44] saying the atmosphere they are feeding
[2:03:46] from everything that comes off the
[2:03:47] internet
[2:03:52] they are feeding all the fourth
[2:03:54] dimension
[2:03:56] it's right here brother Brian said it's
[2:03:57] right here it's writing this wrong
[2:04:09] he stay in a place
[2:04:11] of influence
[2:04:14] the brother of God will teach us when he
[2:04:17] preached the message influence I don't
[2:04:18] have no other code to to flash on the
[2:04:21] stream so
[2:04:22] I've I didn't send all my calls you know
[2:04:25] I was doing that last night I was so
[2:04:26] excited I said Thank God I've got this
[2:04:28] PowerPoint thing down
[2:04:31] praise the Lord
[2:04:33] I've got this PowerPoint thing down you
[2:04:35] know before I come out of the office uh
[2:04:37] sometimes I don't I don't finish what
[2:04:40] what I'm standing I'm praying I'm
[2:04:41] waiting on the Lord and sometimes when
[2:04:43] the sunsary leaders say let's let's call
[2:04:45] for the preacher sometimes come on my
[2:04:47] mind I have a code I put it there
[2:04:49] sometimes I'm coming right through that
[2:04:51] door when I've just sent my notes to
[2:04:52] this people back then
[2:04:55] they've been doing some excellent work
[2:04:56] amen praise the Lord
[2:05:00] we are singing songs and you're saying
[2:05:02] well let's greet this brother let's
[2:05:04] greet they are very busy down there
[2:05:06] trying to put everything into a slight
[2:05:09] position
[2:05:14] we'll see a lot of the things that go
[2:05:15] behind the scene
[2:05:18] praise the Lord
[2:05:20] that's the reason why the things that
[2:05:22] you don't like in church do something
[2:05:24] about it
[2:05:25] don't complain because there are a lot
[2:05:28] of things that you enjoy you don't know
[2:05:30] how they do come
[2:05:33] the ones you don't like do something
[2:05:35] about it don't just complain amen
[2:05:47] amen praise the Lord amen
[2:05:53] so you see all of this whole house of
[2:05:55] pharaohs and and you know going around
[2:05:57] with all of the scripture I was it was
[2:06:01] not just to be uh you know uh show
[2:06:04] ourselves smart was was to bring you to
[2:06:06] a place of understanding
[2:06:09] praise the Lord
[2:06:11] thereby the sin of Genesis chapter 3 we
[2:06:15] all are born on a bastard birth
[2:06:19] we are all condemned to that
[2:06:23] because that was an illegitimate birth
[2:06:25] from our father that's what produced
[2:06:26] this flesh
[2:06:27] that's the reason why in this flesh
[2:06:29] there are no good thing
[2:06:35] but for God to get you here today
[2:06:40] it took many years of God dealing with
[2:06:43] your great-grandparents
[2:06:48] for him to get you here in church today
[2:06:52] it took many years of God dealing with
[2:06:55] your great-great-grandparents
[2:07:01] the man I know the seals that you know
[2:07:03] or know the Bible like you know
[2:07:05] but it has some quality
[2:07:08] that make them to keep themselves and
[2:07:10] give birth to the Next Generation
[2:07:12] because you were coming on the scene
[2:07:20] and the Next Generation gave birth to
[2:07:22] the Next Generation because God hired
[2:07:24] you in his mind
[2:07:26] live as a Son of God for this day and
[2:07:30] this age and he was watching over the
[2:07:33] sea
[2:07:38] he would need somebody to stand in
[2:07:40] loudish
[2:07:41] against the lies of the devil he would
[2:07:45] need a young woman that can prove that I
[2:07:47] can keep myself by the word of God he
[2:07:49] will need a young man I can rise above
[2:07:53] social pressure
[2:07:55] still live a decent Christian life amen
[2:07:59] that it will not just end on shedra
[2:08:01] Mission and Abednego but we will still
[2:08:04] have a shadra mission in a belly go in
[2:08:06] our day
[2:08:06] [Music]
[2:08:14] that's the reason why we
[2:08:16] use the mistake of your parents
[2:08:17] [Music]
[2:08:20] and make excuses
[2:08:27] don't blame your parents for your own
[2:08:29] failures
[2:08:31] Grace have come to you
[2:08:35] make use of what is in your hands keep
[2:08:38] yourself from the wrong atmosphere
[2:08:43] yeah
[2:08:46] that's the place we were coming to young
[2:08:48] people that's where we were coming to
[2:08:50] with this whole house of Paris
[2:08:55] that's what John says young men
[2:08:59] you have overcome the world
[2:09:04] because greater is he that is in you
[2:09:09] and what is that great I think the sea
[2:09:11] incorruptible
[2:09:13] which is the word
[2:09:19] the word praise the Lord
[2:09:24] brother Brandon said you have to realize
[2:09:26] it was not you that came predestinated
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:30] it is not you he said it is the word
[2:09:35] it is because God promised to have a
[2:09:37] bride in this age that word was what
[2:09:40] found you
[2:09:50] praise the Lord because if you don't if
[2:09:53] you don't realize that it's the word and
[2:09:55] you just think people says well if I'm
[2:09:57] predestined if I'm predestinated I'm
[2:09:59] predestinated it's not you that came
[2:10:02] predestinating
[2:10:07] it is the word verbum said which is the
[2:10:10] seed
[2:10:11] is that seed
[2:10:15] and because it's predestinated to
[2:10:18] overcome
[2:10:19] is going to consume you it will draw you
[2:10:21] in
[2:10:22] praise the Lord you can be stubborn as a
[2:10:25] rock
[2:10:27] you see a seed on an Iraq what does it
[2:10:30] do it goes all around and then it comes
[2:10:33] around the Rock
[2:10:38] praise the Lord
[2:10:39] you can be stubborn as a rock
[2:10:42] your stubbornness will only keep regret
[2:10:44] for yourself
[2:10:46] because the day that God will get hold
[2:10:48] of you you will regret why you have to
[2:10:50] live the life that you
[2:11:01] know this is your house of pharaohs
[2:11:04] praise the Lord
[2:11:06] this is your time to come forth as a son
[2:11:08] of God
[2:11:10] as a daughter of God
[2:11:13] praise the Lord
[2:11:16] I remember
[2:11:17] there is good
[2:11:20] maybe every
[2:11:23] man that God made
[2:11:25] if you would just be patient
[2:11:29] with your husband you will get the good
[2:11:31] out of him if you just be patient with
[2:11:34] your wife you will get the good out of
[2:11:37] him if he would just be patient with
[2:11:39] your children you will get the good try
[2:11:42] to fetch the good
[2:11:49] try to fetch the good out
[2:12:03] because it's in this flesh
[2:12:06] it's in this flesh amen and nothing good
[2:12:10] is going to come out of it
[2:12:13] this can come pray
[2:12:35] but Johnny I really enjoyed this thing
