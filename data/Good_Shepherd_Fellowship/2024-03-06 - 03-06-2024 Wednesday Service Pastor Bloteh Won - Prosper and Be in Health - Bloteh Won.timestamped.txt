[45:03] last uh uh of the of the Sev that we've
[45:07] been speaking on on Sunday we might go
[45:10] over that again but uh let's let's just
[45:13] read verse
[45:14] six uh and this is
[45:17] love that we walk after his
[45:21] commandment this is the Commandment that
[45:24] as ye have heard
[45:26] from the
[45:27] beginning yes should walk in it praise
[45:32] the Lord amen the Lord bless you you may
[45:35] have your seat while you turn to T John
[45:39] I will study tonight or
[45:44] uh exitation tonight coming from T John
[45:48] and if you if you observe this entire
[45:51] beginning series give us the privilege
[45:53] to be able to go through the ENT entire
[45:57] first second in t John I don't know if
[45:59] you took a time to really read through
[46:02] it but uh there are some things uh over
[46:06] in t John uh some characters will will
[46:09] be looking at uh uh while we go into
[46:13] this but just like I was saying and uh
[46:18] uh uh I didn't not have no no idea how
[46:23] the the worship night was going to turn
[46:26] out but I mean I was I was very proud
[46:29] and I was very blessed that uh
[46:35] uh that we had there praise the Lord and
[46:40] uh and to see that uh we could work
[46:43] around our basic schedule and and come
[46:46] in and and support what was going on
[46:49] that was that was very beautiful that
[46:51] was that was such a blessing that was
[46:53] such a blessing uh many that uh prayed
[46:58] about it and and supported you see
[47:01] uh
[47:05] uh every every great group of people I
[47:09] was thinking about this
[47:13] familiar familiar quote that we we quote
[47:16] all the time and uh
[47:24] uh we quot it brother brandham says uh
[47:28] if the bride know who she is she will be
[47:33] an
[47:35] invincible Army praise the Lord for many
[47:38] years back uh I took the word as
[47:42] invisible for many years back and and uh
[47:46] uh and I think uh I might not be the
[47:50] only one that was guilty of that because
[47:52] I've heard brother brothers saying that
[47:54] the day that I uh it caught my mind to
[47:57] be able to look at that word carefully I
[48:00] went to see what the definition
[48:03] was uh uh and and that that word that
[48:07] brother brandham used Invincible it
[48:10] means uh
[48:14] um an army that is uh
[48:20] incapable of to
[48:23] overcome to subal
[48:26] and
[48:28] uh that cannot be
[48:31] defeated praise the
[48:34] Lord amen and an army that cannot be
[48:38] defeated an army that can overcome an
[48:42] army that is able to
[48:43] subdue so uh
[48:47] uh so we know that that that is a
[48:49] promise and that only comes when uh when
[48:54] we when we know know who we are in the
[48:57] sense of what has been given to us why
[49:00] are we here for why are we here you know
[49:03] uh in in one Sense on the earth in
[49:06] another sense why are we here you know
[49:08] as a body as a people uh uh in this
[49:12] assembly what are we doing here when
[49:14] that Revelation when that knowledge
[49:16] start becoming real to us then uh you
[49:21] know we become an overcoming group PR
[49:25] praise the Lord and for many years we
[49:27] have said that you know God has placed
[49:30] us in a very unique
[49:33] position uh uh you know with uh blessing
[49:37] us with uh uh you know our our cultural
[49:41] group people from different backgrounds
[49:43] and also you know uh uh the the
[49:47] diversities that we bring we he placed
[49:51] Us in such a position that uh whatever
[49:54] we set our our mind to to do we can do
[49:57] it praise the Lord amen whatever we set
[50:01] our mind to and we prayed about it if
[50:04] it's ACC calling to the word of God we
[50:06] can do it I believe that praise the Lord
[50:10] uh many years ago when we put our heart
[50:13] to holding special meetings we were able
[50:16] to carry carry up I think for four five
[50:19] five different year we sustain the de
[50:21] bringing brothers from around the
[50:23] country and uh and it was it was a
[50:27] unique thing and and I believe that
[50:30] there are a lot of things that is in
[50:31] store for us praise the Lord as a church
[50:35] and as a people and we just we just pray
[50:38] that God uh in his
[50:41] uh in his Sovereign Grace will be able
[50:45] to help us praise the Lord he will be
[50:48] able to help us and and bring to pass uh
[50:53] uh the things that uh he will want want
[50:55] to achieve in our midst praise the Lord

[51:22] coner of selling tickets and raising
[51:24] money that was not the purpose the
[51:27] purpose was just to create an
[51:30] atmosphere amen it was it was just the
[51:33] purpose of worshiping our King praise
[51:36] the Lord and uh it was it was such it
[51:40] was so beautiful it was so
[51:45] beautiful it was not
[51:48] boring never took too much of a
[51:51] Time praise the Lord you know this is
[51:54] one of those things just like a preacher

[51:59] atmosphere is rip the preacher run out
[52:02] of
[52:03] not you you stay on expectation and
[52:06] there is nothing more for him to say and
[52:09] I think we were on expectation to keep
[52:11] singing and the brother just thought
[52:13] that it was okay praise the Lord that
[52:16] was
[52:17] beautiful that was beautiful tell John
[52:20] chapter 1 that's where we want to we
[52:22] want to come in on tonight we want to
[52:24] start from there and then on Sunday
[52:26] we'll continue if the Lord want us to to
[52:30] uh but as we read uh uh uh 2 John in
[52:35] verse uh
[52:37] 6 this is the love that we walk that we
[52:40] walk in his commandment I want to I want
[52:43] to talk on something uh uh trying to
[52:46] find a title how to title this this uh
[52:50] uh seven
[52:54] beginning
[52:56] but you will see when we get to when we
[52:59] when we read uh um Ted John there is
[53:04] only one chapter you'll get a picture of
[53:07] uh
[53:08] uh the way I will try to bring a title
[53:11] to
[53:14] this the unto the well beloved G whom I
[53:18] love in the
[53:20] truth belov I wish above all things
[53:26] that thou May prosper and be in
[53:30] health even as thy Soul
[53:36] Prosper
[53:39] amen for I Rejoice greatly when the
[53:43] Brethren came and testified of the
[53:46] truth that is inde thee even as thou
[53:51] walth in the truth now if you go back
[53:55] back to that verse six that we that we
[53:57] read you will see uh that's that's how
[54:00] uh John uh uh uh that's what he stated
[54:04] there the love from the beginning and
[54:05] that love was walking in the truth now
[54:08] so uh uh tonight I want to look at
[54:12] something here as we look at the
[54:14] beginning as we look back uh you know to
[54:16] the beginning and we'll be talking from
[54:18] the beginning that's what we've been
[54:20] dealing with since this
[54:22] year what we want to look at here is the
[54:25] that uh God's children from the
[54:27] beginning they walk in
[54:30] health amen John says here I wish above
[54:35] all things that thou May prosper in
[54:39] health even as thy Soul
[54:43] prospereth praise the Lord so if we look
[54:46] back to the beginning we realize that
[54:49] when God made his first son and his
[54:52] first daughter they were the he being
[54:55] that have ever been on Earth praise the
[54:58] Lord they came right from the hands of
[55:01] God with no
[55:04] illness no illness in their body no
[55:07] illness in their soul no illness in
[55:11] their
[55:12] Spirit praise the
[55:14] Lord now you have to remember that we
[55:17] taking this whole series now from The
[55:19] Book of Revelation John seeing the
[55:22] continuation of the of the church or the
[55:25] continuation of the work of Jesus Christ
[55:27] he's seeing the people coming through
[55:31] the the the revelation of Jesus seeing
[55:33] that we are returning back to Eden and
[55:35] he's seeing the bride you know and and
[55:38] his the the marriage of the Lamb he had
[55:41] the privilege to see the the the the
[55:44] four square City he had the privilege to
[55:47] see everything from now on to what
[55:50] eternity would be and no doubt he can
[55:53] come back to the church and and says uh
[55:56] I wish above all things that thou May
[55:59] prosper in health even as that Soul
[56:04] Prosper praise the Lord so as we talk as
[56:07] we talk on this subject you'll realize
[56:10] there the we will go in the area of
[56:13] talking truth Prosperity because God
[56:16] Prosper his
[56:18] people praise the Lord amen and man May
[56:23] uh H form of PR erity and and a man
[56:26] trying to put on a form that he's
[56:28] prospering he's just he's just
[56:31] impersonating praise the Lord God is the
[56:35] one that fish the Heaven and the
[56:38] Earth and when he make it there was
[56:40] there was nothing like
[56:43] him praise the
[56:46] Lord there was nothing like
[56:49] him since the sun being up it had never
[56:52] rain out of
[56:53] current
[56:57] praise the
[56:59] Lord are we
[57:02] together he's the
[57:04] god that that that brings true
[57:08] Prosperity we'll look into that tonight
[57:11] we just want to take few thoughts and
[57:13] condition our mind as we as we look at
[57:16] the subject tonight so we see that God's
[57:19] children in the beginning you think
[57:21] about that Adam in the beginning he was
[57:24] the the the most prosperous man on the
[57:28] earth that even he could he could come
[57:31] up with a
[57:32] name for an animal and it was just
[57:36] exactly what it's supposed to
[57:39] be praise the
[57:41] Lord
[57:43] amen they were walking in good
[57:47] health and is God's desire that
[57:52] above
[57:53] everything that that we must be in good
[57:55] health because I'm telling you if you
[57:58] are healthy and you are broke without a
[58:02] dime you can be more happier than the
[58:06] man that have all the money stuck in the
[58:09] bank but he don't have health to get to
[58:12] the bank and make use of
[58:15] it praise the Lord nothing important
[58:19] than good
[58:20] health so take care of
[58:23] yourself give yourself good
[58:26] sleep praise the Lord give yourself good
[58:30] sleep what think about it the Bible says
[58:33] God do not sleep he do not Slumber but
[58:36] yet he GTH
[58:38] sleep to his beloved there's a reason
[58:42] why praise the Lord amen there's a
[58:45] reason why sleep is one of the best
[58:49] ingredient to good
[58:53] health
[58:57] praise the Lord amen sleep is one of the
[59:01] best ingredient to Good Health our our
[59:05] age uh this age is detera because
[59:08] science have given us all sorts of media
[59:11] that Rob us of
[59:12] sleep find people the uh especially the
[59:16] young people spend half of the night on
[59:18] the phone looking at what they are not
[59:20] looking at they are not supposed to be
[59:22] looking at and they get up in the
[59:24] morning so tired as if to say they were
[59:27] carrying tons of break on their head
[59:30] it's all because you didn't
[59:33] sleep one of the best
[59:36] ingredients for good health is
[59:42] sleep praise the Lord are we
[59:46] together so we want to look at this that
[59:51] uh uh what they were walking in through
[59:54] truth and and uh and and because they
[59:56] were walking in truth in the beginning
[59:59] they were walking in good
[1:00:01] health they were walking in good health
[1:00:04] I would take few calls tonight and uh uh
[1:00:08] I was I was listening to a message that
[1:00:11] that that
[1:00:12] U it got me into uh uh into a tunnel
[1:00:17] into a valley and I was thinking about
[1:00:19] okay uh let me not run ahead of myself I
[1:00:22] have enough time to be able to develop
[1:00:24] this
[1:00:25] but uh if you if you think about it you
[1:00:29] will you will realize that uh in the
[1:00:31] book of Corinthian and also in the book
[1:00:33] of Peter the Bible speaks
[1:00:36] about also in the Book of Romans the
[1:00:40] Bible says uh uh let let's just read few
[1:00:42] of those verses and
[1:00:46] uh let's read few of those verses I
[1:00:49] don't I didn't have them over in
[1:00:53] mind in my note but
[1:01:03] uh praise the
[1:01:09] Lord but there were just few of those uh
[1:01:14] uh things you think
[1:01:16] about and as you are looking at the
[1:01:23] subject
[1:01:25] Romans chapter 88 verse
[1:01:33] 32 Romans chapter
[1:01:45] 8:32 we'll just take one of those verses
[1:01:49] there let's read from verse 31 what
[1:01:52] shall we say it what shall we then say
[1:01:55] to these things if God be for us who can
[1:01:59] be against
[1:02:01] us he that spare not his own son but
[1:02:07] deliver him up for us all how shall he
[1:02:11] net with him also freely give us all
[1:02:18] things praise the Lord amen amen all
[1:02:23] things
[1:02:25] if he could give us if he could spend
[1:02:28] that his son which of course we know
[1:02:32] that it was God taking on sisting
[1:02:34] element body stepping down to come and
[1:02:38] identify himself with us if God could go
[1:02:41] to that length of giving his life what
[1:02:45] will he hold back from
[1:02:48] Us Praise the Lord I'll tell you that
[1:02:52] Adam never had to work work a day to
[1:02:56] become the heers of the heavens and the
[1:03:00] Earth to be uh H uh uh uh the governor
[1:03:04] in in uh uh Eden he never had a work a
[1:03:08] day it was freely given to him and God
[1:03:12] told him have
[1:03:16] dominion praise the Lord he owned
[1:03:20] everything he was an amateur God on
[1:03:23] Earth everything was subject to him he
[1:03:26] never had to work a
[1:03:29] day if God would give us his
[1:03:33] life then what will he hold
[1:03:37] back what is good for you or what are
[1:03:41] you Desiring that he will hold
[1:03:46] back are we
[1:03:48] together praise the
[1:03:51] Lord if you if you if you think about it
[1:03:54] before Adam came he never had to work to
[1:03:58] start Gathering
[1:04:00] things everything was there that's why
[1:04:03] man was made on the sixth day he was the
[1:04:06] last one God had prepared
[1:04:12] everything everything that you need for
[1:04:14] this life Journey was already here
[1:04:17] before you got
[1:04:20] here praise the Lord you think that you
[1:04:23] are working hard you think that's why
[1:04:25] you think in your
[1:04:28] mind but God has already
[1:04:35] supplied praise the
[1:04:38] Lord you you are just breaking
[1:04:41] into what God has already freely
[1:04:47] given he that spare not his own son but
[1:04:51] deliver him up for us or how shall he
[1:04:55] net with him also freely give us all
[1:05:03] things praise the Lord the fall put us
[1:05:07] in a position of
[1:05:10] work the fall put us in a position where

[1:06:28] give us all
[1:06:33] things are we
[1:06:39] together yeah sometimes we think that
[1:06:47] uh let's look at another one
[1:06:53] again
[1:06:58] look at this one uh let's look at uh 1
[1:07:02] Corinthians chapter
[1:07:07] 6 this one this these other two verses
[1:07:11] actually that's what I was I was
[1:07:12] thinking about uh uh
[1:07:16] yesterday I was thinking about it
[1:07:19] yesterday listening to a
[1:07:22] message
[1:07:28] I was driving up yesterday evening to
[1:07:30] visit a brother and his wife I was
[1:07:32] playing the message but I I was thinking
[1:07:34] about this while I was
[1:07:42] uh listen to this now
[1:07:46] now uh 1 Corinthians chapter 6:2 do you
[1:07:51] not know that the Saints shall judge the
[1:07:54] word and if the word shall be judged by
[1:07:58] you are you unworthy to judge the
[1:08:02] smallest
[1:08:04] matter amen if we're going to judge the
[1:08:07] word is it I mean can we just sit down
[1:08:11] and talk things between
[1:08:14] ourself should we be spraying it trying
[1:08:16] to get you know thousand people opinion
[1:08:20] should we be blackmailing one
[1:08:22] another
[1:08:26] know ye not that we shall judge
[1:08:30] Angels how much more things that
[1:08:35] pertain to this
[1:08:38] life do you see the the disadvantage
[1:08:42] place that our sin birth put us
[1:08:47] in it put us in a in a very
[1:08:49] disadvantaged
[1:08:52] place because as we as we go along and
[1:08:55] we look in the subject you will realize
[1:08:58] there we never needed to work a day in
[1:09:00] our
[1:09:02] life praise the
[1:09:05] Lord amen there was no F in the in the
[1:09:09] wilderness when Moses LED those people
[1:09:11] for 40 years there was no shopping
[1:09:16] center that was after the fall that was
[1:09:18] not in the Garden of Eden that was after
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:21] fall God St proof
[1:09:25] praise the
[1:09:26] Lord that men shall not live by bread
[1:09:29] alone but by every word of
[1:09:32] God that just being h h h h dedicated to
[1:09:36] the word of God God God God heard them
[1:09:40] even though they were auring they were
[1:09:42] they were grumbling they were
[1:09:43] complaining against Moses but that
[1:09:46] pillow of fire that was hanging over
[1:09:47] them by night that was the presence of
[1:09:50] God that was the lust and and and that
[1:09:52] was the word the world was there because
[1:09:55] the word was
[1:09:56] there he healed their
[1:09:59] sicknesses praise the Lord there were
[1:10:02] children that were born in the
[1:10:06] wilderness and you know where children
[1:10:08] is there is always cuts and and and and
[1:10:11] breaking forth and all of
[1:10:13] that because children will always be
[1:10:17] children praise the Lord but yet God
[1:10:21] sustained them
[1:10:27] this mindset that God created the word
[1:10:30] and sent us down here to suffering is is
[1:10:32] the sin is the sin is the sin
[1:10:35] nature that tells you
[1:10:41] that praise the
[1:10:43] lord it's the same nature that tells you
[1:10:45] that that's the reason why h a man we we
[1:10:49] we feel like we we need to do
[1:10:52] something to to bring up bring ourself
[1:10:55] to to a better status
[1:11:03] Cod are we
[1:11:07] together now let's take this one and we
[1:11:10] start we start preaching here before our
[1:11:12] time is gone second Peter chapter
[1:11:17] 1 now this this will be the last part of
[1:11:21] what we will be dealing with on this
[1:11:22] subject because it will bring us a
[1:11:24] little bit into the statue of the
[1:11:27] perment to understand why brother
[1:11:30] brandham called that a living Monument
[1:11:32] because that's what Adam
[1:11:35] was praise the lord we will understand
[1:11:38] why Peter said if those things be in you

[1:11:44] Barren amen praise the
[1:11:48] Lord but this is this is what I I want
[1:11:51] for us to be able to see here let's read

[1:12:34] airplane but do you have the character
[1:12:37] that's right that goes with an airplane
[1:12:40] owner

[1:15:03] prosperity praise the
[1:15:06] Lord they were prospering in their
[1:15:09] eyesight that they were naked and they

[1:15:54] it praise the
[1:15:57] Lord that man has fallen
[1:16:00] Fallen to such a low
[1:16:05] state that all he need to see is just an

[1:16:10] mind is is
[1:16:15] corrupted they were walking in perfect
[1:16:21] health praise the Lord God Amen with no
[1:16:26] sense of

[1:16:34] thing that is also destroying our our
[1:16:37] health

[1:16:43] Lord because there is nothing there is
[1:16:45] just only you but because of
[1:16:48] fear your heart is even beaten thinking
[1:16:52] that praise the
[1:16:56] Lord but there was no
[1:17:01] fear and that's where we are going back
[1:17:04] to that's where the word is restoring us
[1:17:07] back
[1:17:12] to are we
[1:17:16] together now let's let's take this other
[1:17:19] approach
[1:17:20] tonight it's a Wednesday night
[1:17:27] when
[1:17:29] you let's go to the Book of
[1:17:45] exodor Exodus chapter
[1:17:51] 3 Exodus chapter CH
[1:17:59] 3 was really in a place uh thinking
[1:18:03] about how how to be able to to bring
[1:18:06] this tonight not to not to Bard you or
[1:18:09] not to spill out all of my my thoughts
[1:18:13] but uh you've been you've been very
[1:18:15] gracious to me tonight let's read verse
[1:18:17] 7 and the Lord said I will sure I have
[1:18:21] surely seen the Affliction of my people
[1:18:23] which are in Egypt speaking to Moses and
[1:18:26] I have heard their Cry by the reason of
[1:18:30] their Tax
[1:18:31] Masters for I know their
[1:18:35] sorrow and I am come down to deliver
[1:18:39] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[1:18:42] and to bring them up out of I mean out
[1:18:47] of that land onto a good land and a
[1:18:51] large a good en large land onto a land
[1:18:55] flooring with milk and honey now God was
[1:18:59] speaking to Moses that was Moses in the
[1:19:02] presence of the burning bu God was
[1:19:04] speaking to Moses and now giving him
[1:19:07] this commission I've come down to bring
[1:19:09] my people out of the land of Egypt and
[1:19:12] I'm going to take them to a better land
[1:19:14] I'm going to take them to a land that is
[1:19:17] floing with milk and honey you will see
[1:19:19] it all through uh uh uh uh EX the
[1:19:23] Leviticus every time God speaks about
[1:19:25] the promised land he will say the land
[1:19:28] is floting with milk and honey but when
[1:19:30] they got to the promised land there was
[1:19:33] nothing there was there was no physical
[1:19:35] place where the land was floating it
[1:19:37] looks like honey just coming from the
[1:19:39] rock all milk just pouring out
[1:19:42] no no it was it it was it was a it was a
[1:19:47] kind of a destructive way that God was
[1:19:50] describing that I'm bringing you to a
[1:19:53] better place I'm bringing you to a land
[1:19:56] of
[1:19:59] Health amen just like John is saying
[1:20:03] here that you will prosper in your
[1:20:07] health even as your soul has
[1:20:11] prospered God is saying I'm I'm going to
[1:20:14] bring you I'm bringing you out of this
[1:20:15] land where where you are you you you you
[1:20:19] you have been weped by Tax Masters I
[1:20:22] mean you are you I mean you you are let
[1:20:24] me say it in our term you are under the
[1:20:26] clock amen you've been whipped by the
[1:20:29] clock I'm bringing you to a land of
[1:20:34] rest
[1:20:36] amen I'm bringing you to a land of rest
[1:20:39] a land that is flooring with milk and
[1:20:42] honey that's the way he describ
[1:20:47] it praise the
[1:20:50] Lord but actually when you look over in
[1:20:53] in Joshua chapter 1 when the people got
[1:20:56] across the land The Manor even stopped
[1:20:58] falling they got to go in the field and
[1:21:00] look for the dry
[1:21:02] corn but it was their
[1:21:05] land praise the Lord it was a land that
[1:21:09] belongs to
[1:21:13] them are we
[1:21:17] together they were now going to enjoy
[1:21:21] the promise that God gave their father
[1:21:24] Abraham if they were not going to
[1:21:27] compromise with the inhabitants of the
[1:21:28] land and start looking for people to
[1:21:31] bring tributes if they were going to
[1:21:33] push the people out of the land drive
[1:21:35] them out of the land just like God told
[1:21:37] them to do it was a place if God could
[1:21:40] sustain them in the wilderness God could
[1:21:42] also provide everything that he
[1:21:44] needed praise the
[1:21:47] Lord
[1:21:49] amen look at the Battle of Jericho they
[1:21:52] never even had how to live for a sword
[1:21:53] to fight the Lord fought their about to
[1:21:56] throw the walls of Jericho
[1:21:58] down it was their
[1:22:01] land praise the Lord amen now compare it
[1:22:06] to this compare it to this you see where
[1:22:08] I'm going tonight compare it to this the
[1:22:10] Bible says there in Acts chapter 2 The
[1:22:13] Promise is unto you and to your children
[1:22:17] into as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:22:21] called what is the
[1:22:23] promise what's the
[1:22:25] promise praise the Lord amen what's the
[1:22:28] promise anybody the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:22:33] Ghost is that
[1:22:34] promise but where is the land of the
[1:22:37] Holy
[1:22:39] Ghost where is the
[1:22:42] lande where are you supposed to enjoy
[1:22:44] the Holy Ghost it's not in heaven you're
[1:22:47] supposed to enjoy the Holy Ghost in This
[1:22:51] body that's right the Holy Ghost is the
[1:22:53] promise this body is the
[1:22:58] Lamb that's the reason why the Holy
[1:23:00] Ghost is not a sensation where we just
[1:23:02] shake and shake and shake and you know
[1:23:04] and and and and and and and you know and
[1:23:06] blaspheme as we are speaking in tongues
[1:23:08] no the Holy Ghost is aive that come and
[1:23:10] possess this body and make you to enjoy
[1:23:13] God in your sickness you enjoy God when
[1:23:17] you are broke you enjoy
[1:23:21] God
[1:23:28] it's a land that is floing with milk and
[1:23:30] honey but yet they have battles in the
[1:23:32] land they have to fight war in the land
[1:23:36] praise the lord it's the same way our
[1:23:39] land is floing with milk and honey when
[1:23:41] you have the Holy Ghost but we have
[1:23:49] battles praise the Lord you see that is
[1:23:52] the reason why God promising you good
[1:23:57] health because if you don't have good
[1:23:59] health you will not enjoy the Holy
[1:24:02] Ghost praise the Lord you will not enjoy
[1:24:06] the Holy Ghost it would take it will
[1:24:08] take it would take more it would take a
[1:24:11] deeper experience with
[1:24:14] God praise the
[1:24:16] Lord
[1:24:18] amen are we
[1:24:21] together
[1:24:26] are you with me

[1:24:37] prosper in health is yours God promised
[1:24:40] it and the promise to you is just as
[1:24:44] good as as it was to isra that is the
[1:24:47] comparison that was making praise the
[1:24:49] Lord your promise their promise was a
[1:24:52] physical land your promise is a
[1:24:54] spiritual land the Holy Ghost dwelling
[1:24:57] in your physical
[1:25:00] body
