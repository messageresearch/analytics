========================================

[Music] foreign [Music] everything which was the seventh day of the week which is Saturday but did you notice in this Memorial the wave it on the first day of those the Sheep which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripens you cut down this sheet and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your exception that you are accepted you have come with your sheep and he's the wave it before the Lord on not on the Sabbath the seventy but on the first date which we call Sunday s-u-n-d-a-y of course that's a Roman uh word which they called it the Sunday for the Sun God but how it is changed is not as you in anymore it's the s-o-n-d-a-y the Sunday that that carnal wheat God's first one from the dead just to be waved over the congregation that we are disease and that's the first are the seeds of those the thrift waved upon the first day of the week on Sunday he raised up wave goodbye and ascended upon her in the presence of the people notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from today God's first Corner weed by God's quick and in power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruit of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheep that's why they had to Wade that sheep or it was the first one that come to maturity and it was weighed as a memorial thanks to thank you God believing at the rest of them would come there was a sign and today because she was the first Son of God to come to form authority to be in God he was plucked up from the earth as waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had he'd been typed and many times and we'll see later that he was tired but this is really the first fruits of them that slept he was waived over the promise seed that had promise of life he was waived at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving Mighty Russian wind and it was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for uh the blessing to come and to be waived again we realized in the last days according to Luke 17 30 in the Sunday again in the days that the son of man will be revealed or waived again over the people who is the son of nation in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word would make flesh and dwelt Among Us instead of all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of God by word of God by Signs by wonders we see the day that in the book of of Luke Harris as we just quoted from the Luke the 17th chapter the 31st and Malachi 4 in the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again if ways over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us has given us life as Christ was the first one to raid from all the prophets and so forth all those types in many places he was the first fruits of those who said in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheep waved again all I say oh my God bathing of the sheep what was the Sheep the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about the first time there will come forth for the broad age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism we all be a message that's a full maturity all the word has turned back again it is full power and being bringing over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did calls Holly you live also because Ali you live also what a resurrection that that was and water Resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus but God's quick and empowered he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to him on the day of Pentecost the word may manifest now as I said to be waived again in the last days now for instance you say when I weakness brother Graham I know what church said well I do but now Priuses what if if we were going to go back to Tucson this afternoon now now a huge one of us had a was going to go in a a big Cadillac brand new and all of the seats were made out of no skin softness of the letter soft and easy to sit in and the floorboard s were plush the steering wheel were nickel plated and had diamonds studs all over and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine and the wheels for all had bearings and Breeze up and the tires were all puncture proof and blowout free they're all been tested scientifically they've been pushed off the assembly line both of them and both of them filled up with gasoline that's the running power the gasoline because it is but now when you're going to start them all those of them look just alike but there's one of them don't have any Spark any firing power what do you say the power is in the gasoline brother Brown but I don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power but there's a power there to confirm that that's gas please it just might as well be water until no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the Bible until that wave sheep until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person the freaking that word the gasoline represents the words the truth but without the spirit it won't move but too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic where it needs a dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring the past that this is gasoline might be in a gasoline Can it can still be water see that's the only proof of it is but this life host and it'll prove where it states we should and when you try to put the holy spirit in the denomination you're as much as trying to get a splatter you ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but all around so fast that there is a ten thousand octane power a word of God and a holy ghost to light it up and to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that's shoved that Cadillac down the road to her other Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back to us ways over the people at the day of Pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever that was the first sheep come up from all the prophets which was the Son of God the king of all Prophets there's been churches churches bribes Brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah that has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics shut up that church live to the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's old Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamic to make it work s that's what Hebrews Hallelujah that's what is your proves he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word the body of Jesus Christ cold sipping dead in the great shaking alive and rise again and roll away I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead but now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only a mechanics God's word he was a timeamics to prove it and is he being the crew the pride has to come forth all this part at him and he can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and the others that spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't surprise because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and women take it from his side she had taken a spirit of feminine Spirit Plumbing the placement side faithful mechanics and dymatics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and automatic and tell the church or the people all these Easter bunnies and strawberries and big churches and finally will fail and pass away until that church become full-time many and the case and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did he hit on 16 cylinders so why that is John 14 12. Jesus evil told me the works that I do shall hear you also I'll give him a charge of our Dynamics in his mechanics that's the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day [Music] together the mechanics without the Dynamics for good neither is the dominance without the mechanics you can screaming shot and jump up down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good just cranking around the pissings of got sparked out of fire but no gas near the fire by it'll only work as they come together amen so one will sit still and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yet they both might look like both came to be churches won't claim to be bride but one has mechanics and Dynamics it brings it to pass but what he said is the truth it just won't no matter how good the mechanics is until the time energy comes but Dominique Trump that bar is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that exposes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every emotion ever moves or he is a team yesterday that's the real power of God the Kennedy with the Dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the it's the spark that fires is not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires again see you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the words of Father living father sent me so send I you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything I do only that which is pleasing to God now as he sent me so send I use the same mechanic it takes the same Dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the Dynamics will take its place Paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move yeah it came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the True Believer to eternal life I remember potentially now watch as we are getting out of our time notice The Same Spirit of Romans 8 1. now let's just read that again in Romans 8 1 and we'll see what that says all right and not Romans I mean 8 11 I'm sorry and Romans 8 11. but if there's a problem there's a chance but if the spirit of him God the Holy Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead 12 in you oh there you go if the bridegroom Spirit dwells in the bride when God made his first bride through he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit formed him in the dust of the earth and making material and notice when he maybe from Adam he took not another piece of Clayton he took from the same piece of clay same word for Adam was a spoken word you see he took from him and then taken the he had management and feminist spirit and he took the finity spirit away from Adam and placed it in east or still part of Adam's spirit is Adam's flesh then it was Adam's Spirit the dynamic that quickened the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones then how is this mortal flesh go become his flesh how is it done how what is this great transformation notice now if the spirit of him God that raised up Jesus from today and dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you to protective ones of course like to see laid upon the Earth the one that has life in a medium or dead they were just rotten seeds the waters and veins burn them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life God thought it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the Holy Spirit or the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own sure to catch this good now as the sun was sent across the Earth not to bring rocks which are dirt also July it was not to bring all the dirt all right but was the brain Depart of the dirt which was enclosed around a line Not all men will receive Christ oh no but those which God for ordained lies is housed around some of the dirt of the Earth that's when it comes to quickest they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sky oh that those stunts are hot that rocks into those sun so hot but that little seed said that's what I'm looking for to begin to Spring forth to life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to Quicken The Rock not just quicker than Earth but to quickened the life of the sea now the Holy Spirit comes down of course it wasn't that why won't all the people receive it it wasn't sent to you're unbeliever It Don't Mean a Thing to you it wasn't even sent to you it's said to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them to perish is foolish but to them that are in Christ and part of that seedless life my crude little story about the farmer putting the egg on the eagle egg under the Heat that little Eagle was absolutely he was a his odd looking little creature when this uh farmer had did that thing that he did to put this Eagle ache under this old hand and she asked out a funny looking chicken he didn't look like him his feathers wasn't like the rest of them he just in order of a guy and uh all the rest of chickens recognized him an odd fella and the hen went around he didn't even like the diet she would feed me just didn't like that scratch into the Barnyard he didn't have nothing to do with it so he wondered why he had to be the odd one around there this thing and he never tasted anything that you just eat enough to keep him alive because he didn't like the taste of it see of course he wants a chicken and uh the human clock and you know oh days of miracle today there is no such a thing John the church it just didn't hit right it was a little guy so deep part around the hands until one day his Mammy the old Eagle old laid so many eggs and there was one missing she knew that that ego was somewhere so she starts out on the hot party and she circled over the mountains down in the valleys and over and everywhere where he might a bee by this time it's time for you to be born the time frame be hatched out there may be a crow will come in and pick up my egg maybe a vulture I don't know if something picked up my egg but I know that egg is in my mind I got a son somewhere I got the honey God he's that great eagle and his thoughts he nobody to have a church in order to have a people no matter what cuddle them no matter what this hatched out on her he's hurt he's hunting for his own and one day The Story Goes this old eagle flew over the barnyard she's looking everywhere and she found him oh for that Resurrection to recognize that he really was a chicken ass roll he was an eagle and he's always taught to look down look for a bug or something in the barnyard but he heard her scream and said look up this way and he looked to Bobby and there was a creature the 14 deep wings powerful and all the chickens he wanted him behind your heart and claimed him to be her son he said Mama how can he get two jump start flopping your wings or you're an eagle see she knew she had a son somewhere no matter what he's been raised up in she's got a son somewhere God knows Hallelujah he's got a predestinated four-day Church you know what he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the Holy Spirit begins to fly over that wave sheep but a reality no matter how much I was telling the eagle he didn't know what an ego was yet he was an eagle he would not understood it until he's seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and when we see not a denomination not a PhD not a good neighbor what a son of God molded in the image of God with the dynamic power of God to answer the request of this thing that he's the same yesterday today and forever he ain't no hen gonna hold you hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real ego recognizes the call of God's word uh ego to a eagle the word before the foundation of the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour do you realize your position he hunts for it this then this Earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of God to obedience to the word of God quickly what do you want to know how to get there with her he'd been told he couldn't do that you can't get no higher you jump he's a chicken but this Eagle said that's not so well look at the chickens no matter what the chickens are your eagle just start spreading the who's winning civil exercise start moving up the word to the word the words that I do shall you also be that believeth in me the works that I do shall he also because I live he lives also into spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you he quickens your mortal body [Music] foreign [Music]
