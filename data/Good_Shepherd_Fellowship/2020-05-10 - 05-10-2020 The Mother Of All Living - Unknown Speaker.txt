should I send it to the church mail and he could read a bad sorry for there she says in her testimony in year she says I've been I've been the witness of divine healing true listening to a tape I had an egg cream for a couple of days and yesterday night I was listening to the tape deep color to deep at the end of the salmon the man of God was praying for the sake then at a certain time he started praying for a woman who got something on her neck so when he was praying for her I just lay my right hand on my neck praying to and also believing that God who that girl that God will heal so this morning so that was Friday night in Saturday morning this morning after taking my shower something told me to check my neck when I checked I realized that I was feeling no more pain the Lord is human through the channel of his heaven and I'm so grateful to him praise the Lord Amen we look for more of those testimony and praise the Lord what the Lord is doing in in your chamber you bring it out to

you have the good news amen and as a people that is bearing the good news and we should be those people praise the Lord if we just look around we would definitely see the beautiful things that God is doing we pray that the Lord will bless our sister and bless all our young people bless all the saints as we just shared this time together and I was thinking about I was singing a song here now I'm going away from my head praise the Lord out help me now come on come back to my head praise the Lord but I heard the Sunday School tape going this morning and we stopped right when Bert Brennan was talking about those things you know that Venna queda de terre food and this morning I was going to go back over there and talking about the iniquity of the amur rights because I realized the strata Wednesday night I was more focusing on the vindication and then really talking about what I wanted to talk about but just before I left the house and for some reason I was meditating and just praying committing the service EEMA I mean committing the service in the hands of the Lord and pretty soon then I felt like I should talk on something different that I entire to the mother of all living just to be able to send a mala D message out you know to to all our mothers praise the Lord so we will we will just trust that law will be able to bless it this morning in he will be able to just inspire us as we fellowship around the word of the Lord and oh it was just a chorus that was all mine all mine had to sing this morning and that just by our hairs Heavenly Father Lord we want to bring our house before you this morning great Shepherd the lover of our souls father we are so thankful that we have this opportunity to be able to approach you lord internal rock we come father to you again lower father and just like our sisters sang this morning it brought a lot of memories to us so father for many of us whose mother has cross over the river we think about him this morning we holding dear in our hearts and father to the one slow father God that are celebrating Lord Jesus and as we all celebrate Oh father we just ask the Lord God and most especially this time for the Lord were I mean we should short distance in the different things that is happening we cannot do the things that we would normally do with our mothers and with the family Lord yet but Lord Jesus we want your word to just brighten the memories in our hearts this morning father God and may we net just say like the word oh god maybe not just be a phrase Lord for all God may we from the depth of our heart be grateful Lord gap for the ones Lord Jesus that bear us in your arms Lord the Pharos Lord God that taught us O Lord and let us O Lord Jesus we want to thank you all Father we pray the Lord you will

subject with all reverence O Father God and Lord Jesus the Lord God we can be able to speak of you in a wonderful gift of life that you have given to us we are so grateful this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen is this song which we normally sing it's a chorus we want to see Jesus you reach out and touch and say how we love you open our ears and have us to list Oh P now I we want to see Jesus let's sing a one more time yes okay now eyes we want to see gee to reach out and time and say have we love you open our yes and have a stewed Oh [Music] we want to see [Music] I believe that's our desire this morning we will see Christ's coming from out of the pages of his word bless you thank you sis allow me Genesis chapter 3 we just want to send this out this morning and as a special message to our sisters to our mother and also to the Bride of Christ amen praise the Lord amen because I realized that you know brother Brennan talks about the woman you know and through many of the messages but he had a Bride of Christ in mind and sometimes we get stuck with the you know with the physical woman and then we don't go forward to see that she was a prophecy of the bride so we would we would look in Revelation I mean that Genesis chapter 3 this morning let's read verse 15 actually man Texas from Rome from verse 16 I would read from verse 16 the reason why they stuck out to me this morning verse 16 years says and on to the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and that conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and the desire shall be unto the husband and he shall rule over thee verse 20 verse 20 and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living praise the Lord let us pray father we want to once again father commit this word into your hands this word father is sacred this is your world India law we pray the father you would come just like you did to this man on the role of a Myers Lord God when you enter in shouting with you you broke bread the eyes were open open our has this more to be able to receive from you in Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you now Adam here he called his wife named Eve because she was the mother of all living naturally he called his wife Eve after he realized the promise that God has given to her the Bible says over in chapter 2 and chapter 2 verse 23 the Bible says and Adam said now this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh flesh she shall be called woman now after he came out of his deep sleep he says oh wow this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman but after he heard the promise that God has given to the woman he said her name shall be called Eve the mother of all living praise the Lord I think every time I said he said or she said this thing thing I'm saying Siri praise the Lord Amen so we won't talk yet on the mother of all living praise the Lord and so father he can just capture my little Hebrew definition that I was looking at that this morning as I was quickly trying to together this little thought on my heart for to be able to encourage praise Allah we we realize we are living in social day and social age were I mean we should be grateful for every gif of life that God has given to us praise the Lord and and we are thankful this morning I mean we can we can Ostrow back in our mind to our child who bathing you know and just gather all the pressure memories of our mama praise the Lord but we're gonna talk about the women characters of the Bible a little bit we we get to few of them and we get to few of them if the Lord is able to help us this morning wish of course he's the one that we are depending on for him to help us now we will see here in the world as we would travel with this and just like Paul said in the book of Hebrew I mean the book of Romans he said true one man he won't lay our representation he said true one man Adam you know you know God place all our representation in our Father Adam so also there is a representation I was placed in our mothers Eve and we will look at this this morning to be able to to trust the law to be able to bring out here what a wonderful gift a mother is praise the Lord what a wonderful gift a mother is and I mean she's gifted right from the time that God you know made her praise the Lord she's gifted we will also look at the vet use the brother Branham says God gave to the woman and just just thing about this name she's born with that gift beside gift and calling that is with our repentance there are three divine sacred gift God put in a woman she's born with it a man is not born with Sacre gift of God even though if he is a preacher or whatever he is is a gift and calling with our repentance but there was no gift in his makeup like the woman when God made a woman after he put Adam to sleep in making a woman there were he plays those three Sacre virtue in her praise Lord so we want to look out of there those up those are very beautiful gift you know I mean things that makes a woman to be a mother to be patient you know you know a mother to to have that the kind of nature and the kind of a character that I have is because it's a gift from God it's a gift from God praise the Lord and and we are grateful for all of that so we look through the scripture and look at a few biblical women and see the kind of a gift that was in them and every one of them in some way was was representing they had a representation in Eve so we see here this was beautiful when I saw they this morning in Hebron and use a Hebrew word year which means birth you know the birth that we breathe to live or to give life and the traditional meaning of Eve is living she's the mother of all living but you think about this think about this just like I said Adam called his wife Eve after he heard the promise of redemption that was given to her and and and this woman Eve as we will look through the different types here she's a type of the last day bride that is not going to fall praise the Lord and you will see what a mystery it is because in a beginning she fell so god's attribute can be manifested but she was a type of a bride that that wasn't that is not going to fall which means there was some potential in Eve that she could have not for if God did not allow it if she if if she's typing the endtime bride that would never fall then we have to we have to look you know between the lines and see that because of a plan of redemption that's why the four came now but I was looking at this also and you look in st. John chapter 20 verse 22 when Jesus appeared to his disciple the scripture says he breathed upon them and he said receive ye the Holy Ghost praise the Lord he breathed on them and he said receive yet the Holy Ghost then it was it was strange because we realized here that Jesus resurrecting was just like Adam coming from out of his deep sleep now so there was going to be a change of dispensation just like how Adam when he saw his wife from his deep sleep he said this is flesh of my flesh bone of my bone and she will be called woman now Jesus after the resurrection when he appeared to his disciples the scripture says he breathed on them and he says receive ye the Holy Ghost which means the same way that Adam did was the same thing that Jesus was doing you are flesh of my flesh you are bone of my bone you are spirit of my spirit life of my life received the Holy Ghost because that's what the Holy Ghost will bring to the church so if the Hebrew word for for Eve holes the meaning of breath then we can see why he briefed up on the church because she was going to be the second Eve she was going to have the life of God praise the Lord even though the Holy Ghost was not given yet but he breathed upon the church just like when Adam came out of his deep sleep saying that you are going to be life of my life she's the mother of all living praise the Lord Genesis chapter 5 let's look at verse 2 Genesis chapter 5 verse 2 the Bible says first one this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God may he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created in the day when they were created God called them Adam when God brought Eve out of Adam Adam woke up he says woman praise the Lord when God give if the promise of redemption he says she will be called Eve the mother of all living now you see how in all of the changes of those name just like how God Elohim change siren name from Sarah - Sarah because it was time for the promise on to come that was a very same thing that was playing out through the scripture in the day that they were created God said go home Adam both Adam and Eve because he created both of them the same male and female created he them in His image and called them Adam praise the Lord Adam for a period of time was carrying his bride and he could look at all the animals male and female male and female male and female praise the Lord and trying to look for his female partner he has to keep turning around he keep turning around because she was right on his side praise the Lord and when God brought Eve out the Bible said he said flesh of my flesh bone of my bone she will be called woman wish of course that word actually means a man with a womb that's what it means it actually means a man with a womb because what was going to happen here we have to remember that the spoken word is the original see so right from the beginning God was bringing out his word and his plan of redemption in a form of a seed praise the Lord so he has made a man in in in his image to be the seed bearer and also he's going to make and not a man in His image that is going to be the bearer of the see because that's what the woman is praise Allah we would go would travel a little bit we'll read from the prophet and then we will see that as we go together but just to be able to laid this foundation in us as we look at any year you have to remember verbatim who says this in in the message invisible Union of the Bride of Christ he said the a woman is trusted with certain character that she must not define now I kind of adjust a book I pull out some few things that is just pointing directly to what I want to talk about so we will just keep the subject in mind but because she was cast over on that side we signed when God brought the image from Genesis chapter 126 he put both of them in Adam so she was cast off on that side that's what he's talking about that's that's the reason why over and over he would say she was not in the original creation because she was cast off in the man so he says she has also been given a sacred charge from God for redemption for redemption I don't know how to overemphasize that she was giving the sacred charge of God for redemption let's go back to our Bibles we will look at some few things here as we travel alone verse Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh and stared there off and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto Him like I've always said we see how in in the plan of redemption God has to make a deep sleep to fall on Abraham and and year is it also here God bringing out the woman he had to make a deep sleep to fall on on the man and then the Bible say he took a trip now in death and death darkness what looks like a darkness a deep sleep there he formed a woman why because he was placing this sack rivetti in her that even the devil would not be able to find now I remember is because it's for redemption and redemption is God's playing it's the plain that he had right in the back of his mind all the mysteries in the Bible was because of redemption so he will write that in the nature of the woman and he will cause it to be dag in a form of a deep sleep that would come upon Adam and right in there there were he would give the woman all of these sacra batteries now brother Branham he he types it out he showed us the natural type in a woman a virgin say a woman who mother who he says in the church is the same thing he has given the church that sac referred to you which is the word and a prayer he sees the word prayer and there's a tear one I would get to it just nanus would go along now so because I want us to keep the church in mind now so so we would not be able to lose our place here he says the woman was entrusted with this setting character that she must not defined because she was cast on their side she has also been given a sacrifice from God for redemption she's got a character that she must not define notice now we find that her body is a bearing ground that's the reason why I use I used the word when I said the woman means you know a man before womb because she was the one I was going to be a bearing Graham I was talking to a sister and we were just talking about you know how the bride you know it's a manifestation and she says something beautiful she said but one have you ever thought how a man goes out and he's shopping you know he buy the meat he buy the vegetables he buy all of these he brings it home and the woman has the ability to take the very thing that he gave her to change it to a meal she has that ability to take the raw meat take the vegetable take all the spices all those elements and she can and she can just put flavor that puts him to sleep that's the ability she has it's a gift right from God amen praise the Lord so and therefore it is it is it is a sacred trust it must not be defined now I'm saying now bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church stands that is the place we want to get to this morning as we look at the different types of the woman we want to bring our self to the place to show us where the church stands the mother of all living praise the Lord because that is a promise to the church we have to make the word to live again we cannot just take a church name and be satisfied where Benham says the reason why God gave Adam and Eve is for him to for him to produce himself and that's the reason why God gave Christ a bride to make the word live again because she's the mother of all living the church has the power to put this Bible on two feet like Paul says we are written episode read of all men we have the power to do it we have been given that Sacre trust of God that's why we want to talk about this morning that's the reason why God play all of these things out in time just like how Eve she represents I mean you know the woman that God was giving let's look for an example look at Noah's wife that's not mushed they said about her in the Bible but what we know is that Noah was found righteous before God and he was able to preach a message for 120 years and he had his sons to be able to support him but as I thought about it this morning I said Noah success in his calling I can attribute that to his wife because what a man needs is a woman that would believe in him now if Noah wife did not believe his message it would be hard for the children to support him for Noah's sounds and their wives to support no 100 in 20 years when the entire generation is growing wide the entire generation is growing contrary is because they hire a mother that taught them to believe in their father and I wanted to believe him but to support him for what he's doing and I'll tell you that just what a man needs I mean that's just what a man needs because that is all that God asks us to do only belief praise the Lord that all he asks us to do only believe believe I'm your provider believe I can heal you believe I'm in control that's all he asks us to do only belief praise the Lord so you see God wholly in Eve life and mystery oh it looks like she was not a believer oh and and and we can say all sorts of things that we I mean that we try to say about Eve but she was the first daughter that came from the hands of God and must know we must learn to respect her because she's a type of the Bride of Christ she says type of every godly woman in the scripture praise the Lord amen but we were seeing here their God because he he played like brother Branham said Jesus rebuked those men on the role of mrs and says all full slow of heart why because God slowly unfold his mystery he has chosen people in every age to be able to bring out a portion of what he's doing all through the ages so he played her part Eve was the one that was going to set the the the manifestation of God's attribute in every character that she horse was now distributed to different women throughout the ages no our wife comes out she's representing a church that would believe God's Word when the whole world is going crazy when the whole world will doubt the message she and her children she in her house she's a type of that woman up there solomon spoke about improv herb she in her house she would teach her house praise the Lord in so much that Noah sounds their wives was still with the husband praise the Lord and we also see Sarah remember them they're those sacred trust Sarah right there means princess what the God he'll play out in her life the changing of the body praise the Lord the changing of the body remember this was the very woman from the beginning she trusts God she believed her husband Abraham as the went on and on and she was getting weaker and getting weaker she's like off and an abroad in Hagen praise the Lord and Ishmael was born that you know that didn't matter Oh God off that did not make God to say well I'm going to pack this woman aside why because he has given his promise to Abraham and to kick Sarah off is to kick Abraham off praise the Lord so what God is going to do he's going to build an edge around them to bring his word to father even Abimelech to even visit a foreign King by vision a Bimala we have a visitation from God because of Sarah his name will be pleased in the Holy Scripture because of Sarah why because she was hauling in her body and mystery of the body change so God watch over her God in her and so much that the Bible said that we read there all the time the Bible says and the scripture said put away the bound woman God was so pleased with that I mean she brought her in and she has the right to kick her out just like he said in the book of Judges he told the children of Israel you know you have compromised and with these foreign King I'm not going to take him away you have to fight him out and sometimes won't take decision to be able to deal with things that we compromise with God is pleased with it he says cast out the bondwoman so in Sarah she held the mystery of the body change and she brought for the promise he'd praise the Lord there's a woman that came under the shadow of death there was lots wife amen LOB's was abraham nephew abraham hide him in a Johnny praise the Lord and we realized that I mean Abraham never had no problem with this boy until he got a wife now there was the now had to be arguing over whose ship is this and worship is that and you know he was influenced to go down to the city of lot I mean a city of Sodom but now realized here that lot he have had lot of his upbringing in its training from Abraham II I mean he's been in his house he saw how he was leading devotion he saw the faithfulness of Abraham he saw how everyone believed in a supernatural God and Abraham kept talking about this God they had promised him to be the father of Nations and because of Abraham prayer the angels were go down to sodam to bring Lord and his family out but you see this woman that was called Lot's wife the scripture make us to realize that she used her pass to destroy her future even though the angel came down and said I can do nothing until you get out of here yes that was the instruction that was given to lot I can do nothing Sodom is condemned nothing I can do until you get out of here and Lord and his family took the journey and the angel warned them don't look to your pass don't turn around but she use her pass to destroy her future praise the Lord you see it in there that's that's the reason why over and over bourbon will show us two camps you know he will show us the angels that went down to Sodom but on the other side there was danger and and and and in Abraham's camp praise the Lord we see the Rebecca Rebecca will hold a type in her life that even though she had not seen Isaac but yes she will believe the messenger that toho ever Isaac she have not seen Isaac yet and everything that she knows about Isaac came true Eliezer that's the kind of what type that she holds for the end time right she have not seen Isaac and Jesus came and then he praised Rebecca he said blessed are those that have not seen but belief first Jesus prays Rebecca he said blessed those that have that same but belief because that's what Rebecca was hauling all through the scripture all her life her parents brought her up the mystery that was in her life now should we get to this place where she would just believe this stranger and then I would just come and start telling her tales about a boy from the fire country and she would believe it inasmuch dead right before her parents the answer Rebecca will you go she said how we go she was so caught by the story the LEDs I have told her about this Prince Isaac she said I will go the mother of all living now you have to realize that God in every age was bringing a little a little of was in EVE everything that was in EVE all the sacred trust and their their their their the ability that she has that she could not displayed in Eden God distributed three throughout the ages that is the reason why this endtime Church can represent Eve because it was being played out it was being played out until it came to that woman Mary that said be it unto me I call into that word let me not get ahead of myself day a lot of them we have to talk about this morning praise the Lord Amen glory to God or we tank the Lord praise the Lord amen and then we can talk about richer praise the Lord we talked about Richard a Jacob went down there actually you know he he loved nature but Lebon being a business man you know God here on a type was going to play out you know what it would still play out the Jewish Church in the Gentile church you know but yet we realized that Richard she had a mystery that she had in her life amen you have to remember that over and over the Prophet Zacharias I mean Jeremiah sorry he talks about Richard you know a woman weeping for her children amen so Richard was the weeping mother she had that mystery that she had in her life you think about it how many years that she wept when she saw her sister Leah bringing children and she could not have the Bible says she went over to to Jacob and says give me trial is a die so you could see how her heart was filled with lamentation or mine I was just reading that book and I just kept thinking about it you know lamentation I mean that is one care that God gives to his people because there is a language that is Elementary in the only galkin year I mean when a person is is lamenting is almost like you are speaking tongues praise the Lord because I mean you are saying words you are saying things out of out of your grieve out of your cry but there are no words that the human you know ears can understand that is the reason why Eli taught that Hannah was was drunk she was weeping before God she was uttering words that he could not make sense out of because the language of lamenting is not for humans the language of lamenting is for God when a person is really crying out their soul to God praise the Lord so Richard she represented she had she had a mystery the Bible says in travail she will bring forth you know she had a mystery of the bride I will be able to bring forth I mean with weeping and crying and the many things that will have to bear throughout the ages look at the church the kind of a painting and destruction that the church has come true but she stays standing praise the Lord richer she was holding the mystery of a weeping mother now even even in her last childbirth she crying out the name of Benjamin praise the Lord and over and over what can we say about Jack Abed that's another mother praise the Lord Amen that was that was that was that was ready to sacrifice her son not only in the sense of sacrificing him to lose his life but she just believed that you know the angel of the Lord was going to watch over this boy she did not fear the Kings come I mean amen she did not fear the Kings coming and she put him right on the leg and send the sister go by the lake and wash your little brother and and and and and just think about it the Raven I feel with krokodil what a fit that she has that she would be able to put her son you know in the hands of God just like Hannah said you give me the son I would give him back to you amen that was the kind of a mother the mother of all living praise the Lord she was protecting the life of her son because she's a life giver and the scripture say he said and we know God honor her faith God was so pleased with her faith until God rewarded her that she was paid to take care of her own son God was so pleased with a fit that she has until God rewarded her he never waited for her to get to heaven before she receive a reward God reward her right on earth that she would take care of her son she would tell him the promises of Jehovah she would train him she was sold the seed of righteousness that's what better Brennan actually took the fifth gospel from when he talks about the fifth gospel he goes back to Jacobin that she was the one right in the house of Pharaoh to plan the Seas of Jehovah in the heart of Moses that when he grew up to be forty years those words of Jacob air would stop haunting him those words would stop playing in his mind the mother of all living praise the Lord Amen you see just like Lot's wife she used her past to destroy her future but this woman called Rahab she had a horrible past and she was not she was not she was determined not to look back in the past she believed the messenger she hanged at talking on her she was ready to get out of her pass and not to look back because Joshua told her your entire pass is going to be destroy this entire world is coming down that was what the spies to her and she was ready to believe their message look to her future not even knowing what the future was going to be but she looked to the future praise the Lord and God honor her faith bless her future to be married by a Hebrew sodium man a general and also to be listed in the lineage of Jesus Christ god bless her future praise the Lord all we can just look at the mother of living soul the mother of all living we realized here it is this sacred trust that God gave the woman in the beginning that is working out here in all of these spiritual attributes there is something about her that is attached to life and it's all speaking about the endtime Church it's all speaking about the bride of Jesus Christ God gave her these sacred trust it's a gift she's born spiritual man she's born spiritual she's born with this gift it's in her life praise the Lord we're branches just from a little girl she likes to play with Dora you know why she likes to feed them she likes to bathe him there was something in her that is just about life boys likes playing with car your accident they like to see accident Bill Haas break it down but in her there was something about life praise the Lord a man is given to her now we look at these women we just talked about Rahab year that they not use her pass to destroy her future didn't look back in the past she look in the future and and god bless her for that because she received the messenger believed a token message and she was able to go on not even Noreen just like what Ruth did the same thing play out in the life of Ruth their praise the lord she's you know he said to her mother in Lord your God would be my god your people will be my people not even knowing what was waiting for her but yet God bring her to marry Boris the kinsman redeemer God playing out this plan of redemption you know and there was what Adam heard when God said you know you will bring for life he says no I will call her Eve the mother of all living Adam was speaking out of prophecy he was not only looking at the natural birth he was looking at the promise remember God has already told a woman from his herd a woman see that a woman see would bruise the head of the seven so Adam was looking at what would play out in the future how it would be the woman to be able to it was Sarah that gives Abraham the promised seed in and true that the Patriot come and God was able to run out his his his bloodline through the Jews and on and on and on and on and see how out of this Gentile women came also into the promise she's the mother of all living she's born like that she's born gifted but Branham says by nature she's able to do many things good she can multitask that's the way she's built is a gift Oh and we know from the scripture right from Genesis that's the reason why the devil did not go after Adam he went after it because he knew she had a gift if the devil can be able to destroy that gift if he can might that gift you know what he want to do brother Branham says if he can destroy the confidence in the word he can get the believer if he can be able to destroy the gift he I mean or mother gift they will put you to the place word just like Paul that's why Paul had to live the way he live because there was something that was always in his subconscious when he remembered witnessing Steven death and witnessing the death of all the other believers that they will trap him to that place every time he remember a weakness him so he had to put more into the kingdom of God because she had a gift that's what the devil went after her and what was the I gave Redemption Redemption we see this the same type out there in Hana Hana the Bible says every year they would go out to the temple and it would go to the feast the when years after years she would go with her maid and the children as a young woman she started to design Lord you know give me my child she was believing you know the husband to her a Hannah and I always give you a water potion you know I love you to death that's that's that's that's good that was good enough for her but we will realize that Israel were also at a time where there was setting value all the covering of Jehovah that the church was losing Eli was here his sons robbery were all in a tabernacle she go and see all of these things and the Bible says they are there they are dragging the daughters of Israel into also some things she's seen the disorder in the house of God and I mean all of there she goes so birding and said God if you give me a son I would give him back to you well now she did not want to want a child for her own but she wanted a son somebody that can be able to stand up and change the course of Israel so you see her birding went beyond herself she was not only being selfish and just needing for herself but she saw the need in the house of God she saw the need in Israel all the Bible says it was such a time were every man eyes every man ways was good in their own eyes there was no open vision the people were not hearing directly from the Lord ela and his boys I mean they were just doing whatever that pleases them they were taking the things of the Holy of the sacrifice and and I mean it was just they were just fooling around and every time she goes down there her heart is broken in oh she's crying what are we in all jehovah where is your promise we heard how your presence move them on our people God if you give me the son and we give him back to you in another sense she was saying raise up a man that would bring us back to the Word of God that will bring us back to the things of God the mother of all lady she wanted to see God living among his people again she wanted to see all the back in the house of God she wanted to go to a church where she can see the presence of God praise the Lord she wanted for God to live among his people that's the mother of all living her desire was not just for herself cause the her desire was for the house of Israel and little Samia was born and a gift returned back to the church open vision started to come back to the church once again the man of God can hear directly from God God started to speak to that young man even from a young age because his mother desire was for the house of Israel she wanted the Word of God to live among the people once again praise the Lord if you give me a try I would give him back to you amen that's the model that's a mother's desire he mean there's a mother's desire she wanted to see God back in the mists of the people she started seeing or tire seeing all the things that were happening you know in the church in Israel all the dis order and once again God rose up a prophet rose up a prophet they were now annoyed a king praise the Lord you know the scripture in the book of Corinthians Paul came in he says if a believing woman choose to live with her unbelieving husband the both way he says it but you know the Bible is so wonderful I was thinking about that this morning as I was meditating this you know asking the Lord and just throwing my mind through the scripture I think some I think about Abigail this is the time of David praise the Lord Debbie is so Johnny he's a fugitive he's running all over the place Abigail the love of her father my goodness he made the love of her father well yes she had a husband that was rich like laude sure arrogant disrespectful he was just caught up in his wealth and the Bible called him a food but you see she knew the weakness of her husband but she has such a gift not to despise him what she did she's - in the bridge she was a woman who gives Centrify her husband because David was going to cut that guy head off he says we are in the field and have my man in the field protecting your chips and then you cast him in davie oh he was not ready - but Abigail ran before him ran before her husband she fell down before David and oh my lord then Matt don't put blood on your hands because this man is so caught up with this last day spirit he's reached blind don't put blood on your hands what she was doing she was using her garlic character that's what Peter said if a man does not believe he can be went over by the conversation of his wife which mean that word conversation means the behavior so the behavior of Abigail kept giving hints in Ewa cabinet I never kept her husband from dying it kept their hands from from from from from blood because God took his life after and what did God do God reward her to be your wife - David so she she was holding a mystery living in a loud issue is reach for aplenty she was in the house of a wealthy man but yes she knew her mind was thinking about David she knew that David was coming to be king she knew there was something about this man David when everybody ran through the street and said David care I saw a thousand defecate ten thousand what was happening the people knew that God was risen up man that was going to defending even though he had not come to power yet but people knew because Goliath was a terror to Israel even the King Saul I mean he was he was hiding in its own shadows and they were stood up just in the time of need so they all knew even Germantown saw son knew there was something special this man was born to be a deliverer of Israel so they respected him so even though she was in a her rich husband house a type of loudest church but she knew there was a coming king she knew that we had to respect him even though he's not empowered yet but he is our coming King praise the Lord she ran right there and she saved daring hands from defining his hands with blood he pleased the Lord and God rewarded her she was a mother of all living she never won a for David to spin his hand with blood and she was also saving the life of her husband let God be the judge he may praise the Lord it means she never left him and said well he's a fool I'm going to divorce him he's not golly you know he don't have the holy God no she's still right there love of her father she stayed right there she's a tide of the end time Brian amen oh mine I mean we can just go on this morning the mother of all living they are living all through the scripture their characters are living characters praise the Lord a living character because they were speaking about this endtime bride oh we can talk the shimmy not woman I mean we can talk about the one that had to bring all the vessels in and I mean and fill them with Arden and like like Paul says time will not allow us we can go through all the different types in the scripture all of these women they were all pointing to the coming bride praise the Lord you see the difference there between the Abigail and Michele amen the one that saw David returning back praise the Lord I mean she was so concerned about her pride and and and and her dignity that when David was coming before the ark she despised him and what God did god make that church to be a barren church because she despised the word realizing that it was not David that was coming it was the act that was coming David was rejoicing because the word was coming and she missed honors to death praise the Lord you know just like people when somebody is rejoicing over the world Laurie Alleluia they just love dancing why are you making noise for you're not despising that person you are despising the word because the person is rejoicing because the word is coming and whenever you despise the word you I mean there is no way you can be able to bring for the world when you despise the world praise the Lord you know so God go seal her womb because it is past the word amen so we see over and over out of this tide the mother of all living she was to bring foreign and in all the ages you know God use Jocko bed if she was not there to take that decision Israel we're not going to have a deliverer there was not going to be the first Exeter prophet so she made the promise of God the promise that or give to ever ham she made that promise to leave Syria had to be there to make the promise that God gave to Abraham to live that's what making her the mother of all living the church is here for me Christ promised to live to bring the promises on to field we will lay our hands on the sick and the sick will recover that's the promise of God there will be a people that is ready for the rapture there will be a church with a sport or that's the promise of God that there will have to be people on earth embody with the promise of God that we have to be a people on earth that will not taste death praise the Lord Oh mind we are if we believe that we are there people don't be afraid of coronavirus amen it does not have enough because we have a promise not to taste death the different things that we might go through we reflect our body but death can I guess through our blood amen praise the Lord that is a promise the mother of all living whenever we see that the promise of redemption we look at the church there was the attitude of the first Adam then we can come down to this woman Mary the Jewish church has gone through many years without a prophet but Isaiah has prophesied that a virgin shackles Eve praise the Lord never in history now see Mary here is going to fulfill what God wanted to do in Eve but God could not do that without displaying his attributes Eve was supposed to bring sounds by the spoken word praise the Lord but if she was going to bring songs by the spoken word we will not know the other attributes of God so you see the sacred trust that God gave Eve the sacred trust because of redemption that's the reason why is it's more spiritual unto the church that's what Berta Branham says here he says now he says I'm speaking them bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church things I'm not speaking of you women whatever you are does between you and God or you men but I'm speaking to the church in Christ now the this she's giving to bring for life that only God Himself can give only God Himself can give and what is that life is the life of Jesus Christ it's a spiritual life now only God Himself can give so you see that's the reason why a person can have a person comes from the world and all of that when when they see the plan of redemption God is able to restore their life God is able to make them like a Rahab bring them out of Jerry call bring them from out of the bypass and put them into a future that they can never look back in the past and their spiritual sacrifice you in her that you can see her and you can never even tell she ever that she ever was in Jericho you remembered Joshua doing rehab wedding and he says is there anybody here has any reason why this man and this woman should not be married praise the Lord Amen the only people that went down to Jericho were the two spies amen praise the Lord there was nobody of her pod that was in that wedding because everybody in Jericho died the service that I mean the entire city was was was destroyed so she did not have to look back she knew what happened she knew it was sooner she and her family another talking message that came out she did not have to look back during the wedding because she knew her past was destroyed praise the Lord but yera said God will now find a young woman engaged to a man then all the things that is women play out through the ages Rahab roof and all these women oh my god how can I leave Esther out praise the Lord and not a character if I die let me die amen she was it she was ready to go before the king when it was not even time for her to go what does she feel it on the field later on that she was ready to go lay yourself down because of her people she she too was carrying a mystery praise the Lord she too was carrying a mystery even in a time when everything was good and Haman has not rise to the scene to start having hit for the Jews but God knew who that would be their God knew the hatred will have raising in his heart why if there was not an Esther on the truth why if there was not an Esther to intercede so God knows was going to happy in the future and now he's giving us the opportunity or to feel our self with the world he's giving us the opportunity to stay in your home pray listening to the tape prepare yourself whatever is coming is going to come anyway as to have the opportunity encouraged by her uncle Mordecai to go and be among those women being a Jewish girl God favored her just so she can be in the right place at the right time praise the Lord oh I don't I don't believe it was just all because of her natural beauty it was because God favored her for her to be in the right place at the right time I mean so we see he give us the three sacra virtue years spiritually the word prayer and the life just running that in my mind I'm saying Oh God where is the tear one it means so we see here that Mary got a young woman just like you know well all the other young women in Israel for all everything that is women are playing our true through the scripture go to Eve the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent can you imagine Adam just standing there listening to God talking to Eve I will put an ammeter between your seat talking to the sepal and a woman see why the woman see what God didn't say mine since the woman see how high is that going to happen just been in her head here and ghost he knows talking to even saying you know you're going to bring full life in you know in in pain and conception your husband is going to have the rule over you you know what the scripture says after God said there the Bible says he rubbed them in sheepskin got the next verse that comes after there he wrapped him in sheepskin and I can imagine Adam holding his white hand as a walking out of Eden with the ship's came flopping on their legs and the blood dropping he turned to her say you be the mother of all living just thinking about the promise that God have said the woman seed he says I'm going to call you if you be the mother of all living he's thinking is mine you know trying to to imagine the big picture of redemption praise the Lord trying to you know sometimes we get so stuck in the mistakes I mean if you can just look over the mistakes and see the big picture I mean it just fill your heart with enough room to forgave praise the Lord I mean he was just walking down there he was thinking more on the promise of God and thinking on what the second day to Eve he was thinking on what God have just said the woman will have a seed that would bruise the head of the serpent he was thinking on there more he would be the mother of all living oh my goodness she's going to have a seed that would bruise the seven head oh my goodness I mean just that word that God has spoken make Adam to put Eve to a special place just our word give him their the ability to restore e to the police were he have always known her I never even knew she would be the mother living she would bring the word to life can you imagine sister hope waking up and telling bourbon you preach about it but you don't know nothing about it I think yes that's what that's what each item was thinking in his mind as they were walking oh my goodness oh honey I love you I love you more than I did because God just spoke about you yes Mary like Bertram says out there fetching water then angel appeared to her and she said this was be it on to me I call him to your word praise the Lord submitting herself to the word accepting what the angel is saying to her not even knowing that the next day her name is going to be in the Jerusalem page because except in that word her good friends going to walk away from her her high school friends when I want to identify with her because she carrying the promise I'm going to keep myself I'm living for God she's not ashamed to say that she's carrying that promise when she said be it on to me that call into your word even some of her family members they're going to say all sorts of things about her but it was a coming of the woman seed it was the coming of the woman see she was going to have a seed without mains interference illiterate type of how we received the Spirit of God in our life it does not come through an organization it does not come to a church it does not come through a man jesus said he he came unto his own I mean John testified that he came unto his own his own received him neighbor as many that I receive him he has given him the power to become the sons of God now born of the flesh not born of the will of man but a birth from God this last this church is just like miracle we receive a life in us that will not come about an organization it will not come about a system is the life of God Paul says you know he says we we are born of I mean the mother Jerusalem that's how he types the bride and God has given us these sacrificio that the church needs to guide I mean we need to feel ourselves with the word we need to always have you know an atmosphere of praying because that's the thing that is going to bring the world to life that's what we are caught oh that is our our I mean in such a time where the word is having no hope I mean hopeless and things that are happening around the world I mean we supposed to bring life life of encouragement that's what we have been raised up for that's why we've been taught out of these years a people that is not just associated to a church but it's bringing forth the very life of Christ that's the reason why every time we hear the word we says be it unto me according to your word Lord I know I'm not there yet but one thing's for certain I know I'm not what I used to be this is the mother of all living just like all of those women through the scripture can you imagine now being going back and not knowing how she will be able to get all her inheritance she has lost everything because she don't have a man to redeem it her songs I did her husband is dead she's going to go back to her own land in her own house and she's going to be squatting with someone because honor the Lord of Israel one of her husband brothers has a right to claim his brothers property and if he's nice to her he would just say well I mean just just get a little tame down there or you go and live in the shed but there was a woman a gentle woman your God would be my god your people would be my people she stepped out there if you are going to I mean if they were a treat you they will have to err treat me they got back there in the landing she was not a friend she took her basket she went down to the field they're all looking at her she get earrings hanging down or years is it what kind of mobile woman is this and you know she's not dressing right but she's in the field in a way she's looking at the girl she says oh yeah the dress different year oh yeah you know well and she go home she asks her mother-in-law Dean and then she's learning all of these things from the scripture the next day she tried to dress like them but I mean I mean she's just doing the best that she knows until the eyes of all fell on her amen and that's the same thing we do I mean we give our self to the world we do our best until the eyes of our bones can fall on us and when when and when the eyes of our boy was following us in the form of the Holy Spirit it changed your life forever when boy's eyes fell on her roof was no longer the same Amy and I believe he said he sent royal dresses for her to where she could put away all of those MOBOT skirts and mobile trousers and mobile on clean dress and now she's dressing like a princess because the eyes are boys for on her but while she was saying there why why to give life to Nami to restore everything that Naomi lost all her lane or her husband property because now her daughter has married a man boys that can stand up for the family and be able to redeem everything now once again now me would not have a voice she says Ruth you're better to me than seven sons I have only two but you have brought so much joy to me I feel like I had ten sons just your action just your support just your commitment to the word Hobart brand and play her there you I mean root seven root in sacrifice root being reward I mean she was growing out of all through those things the mother of all living she brought life to now me once again now making come on her porch and she can sing the song of Zion she don't have to hang her head down because she had a daughter that's two with her and that's how this endtime bride is all they can say what they want to say praise the Lord but God has given us a revelation of what this message is amen he has given us a revelation of the aim time messenger that the message is not about a man and if it's about a man it's about a man Jesus Christ amen I mean we just we just saw in love you know just like Rebecca was my goodness she knew what Isaac loved she had not seen him but she just know that that I mean he he loved the cool of the evening LA Israel is just telling her all of these things he loved the cool of the evening in the cool of the evening he goes out and he just walked in the field really oh my he loved the time of meditation I mean LEDs are telling her all of this and I mean she just swallowing it I mean she's feeding on it can you imagine the first day she got there she knew exactly what he loved for breakfast and Isaac says how did you know she's well okay ELISA told me he told me what you like for breakfast praise the Lord and that's the same with this endtime bride praise the Lord Amen surely you remember those Gentiles with David his desire was a command to them as soon as he talks about the water birth to him they were ready to put their life on the line that's the same way God has been training us out of this hour or everything we've been going through our different life trials different disappointment live up let's live on our heads and look to the Redeemer praise the Lord there's no time to complain don't blame anybody amen be grateful that you are alive and God has given you another chance come back to the word dedicate yourself to the word don't cast blame on somebody god knew all about it praise the Lord call knew all about it Amen I mean we were said sometimes we said so ignorant leaning and we want to blame and irony we want to blame Eve let God their God so proud about that woman give her the promise of redemption amen the promise of redemption and Adam morning that a purify his mind praise the Lord and he was so glad you know walk out of Eden with his wife he went live happily with her keeping in his mind every time he remember you think about it wow he never said anything to mean about my see my goodness God coming down you know rewarding her knowing how hurt she was and that's what he when he gave us the baptism of the holy ghost he knows all the things that we have gone through he knows all the hurt and he knows that he gives us the Holy Ghost is able to feel the vol we can have joy unspeakable and full of glory they can just be something in our heart that we are ready to face another day no matter how the Trier is high this church is the mother of all living why because we're going to bring the death scenes back to life they've been waiting on us we are the Church of the Resurrection the mother of all living and then when those their sins comes up we step on the other side Nevermore to die amen this is the church the mother of all living when the death scenes comes and we get in the rapture death is its lock out we don't have to think about it we don't have to talk about it because death is going to be no more praise the Lord forever we live with with the king we live with our Lord the one that we love the one that will be we've been waiting for we've been looking forward to so we see all these women in the scripture God had a mystery in your life that we can look at them and know that they've been speaking about us this endtime Brian you know I was sitting on on on the iniquity of the amorite and I came across what brother Branham was talking about the mystery of iniquity and the mystery of godliness he since the mystery of godliness is the church is the bride she's holding the mystery of godliness and the mystery of iniquity he says is that other church we were talking about there let me not start another message here but I want to wish you a Happy Mother's Day and all that God give us the greatest gift when he gives us mothers praise the Lord many will talk about their mother how she will go hungry and make sure that how young ones have food to eat no matter how wicked and evil H is H is never evil to their mother when a mother thinks about her try called my wrongs back to that day in the hospital when she heard the breath of life in her hand she goes back to that moment and that is the same way with the church we value the Holy Ghost because we know without him we can have life there is no way we can live out this life that's the reason why we always remember the experiences we have with God we remember in our tough time we go back to those experiences because those were life-changing women it was life-changing moment when a mother goes through nine months and she hold our baby in her arm it's life-changing and that's the same with the baptism of the Holy Ghost is with the church it's a life-changing moment your life will never be the same don't be afraid of the Holy Ghost because that's what you need to be able to live this life of Christ that's the that's what you need to be able to stand for God in your generation when Paul says I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ it takes the Holy Ghost for you to say the same thing that you are not ashamed of Jesus Christ you are not a team of the message of the hour you are not ashamed to be called a Christian you are not ashamed you know to tell people you don't have a boyfriend don't be a
