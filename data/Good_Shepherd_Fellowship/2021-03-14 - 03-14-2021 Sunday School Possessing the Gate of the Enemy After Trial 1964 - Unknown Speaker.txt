TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] if god kept his word with the natural scene which was isaac let's check some of the national seed that believed the full promise of god and had no question i remember there were tens of thousands times thousands time multiplied thousands that was circumcised and everything else and still was not abraham's seed yes sure that which is you outwards not you that which is you inward they many of them failed bitterly failed look in the wilderness they said we the day of the passover or to drinking at the fountain saint john 6 there's all rejoicing jesus said i'm that rock that was in the wilderness i'm the bread that come from god out of heaven if a man may they have not die they said our fathers eat man in the wilderness for 40 years he said and they are everyone dead dad take that word and run and see what it means eternally separated yet they were abraham's seed death means separation annihilation completely destroyed annihilation jesus said they were dead every one of them yet they were circumcised jews see folks just because we're in methodist baptist presbyterian god little confessions things like that the devil bleeds just as much as we do [Music] but you've got to be identified with it god's got to witness it to it by sealing with the holy spirit no question of the word if you say well that was for the other day is something wrong what if a man come running and you told him the light was shining and he run down to the base and said how just refuse it i just refused it there's no such a thing as life i don't believe it there'd be something wrong with that man he'd be mentally upset if he refuses this warm raise and his life-giving resource there's something wrong with him mentally and when a man sees the word of god made plain before him and identified and then shuts and pulls down his denominational curtains say something wrong with that man spiritually amen something's wrong with him there's something spiritually wrong you just can't receive it blind and don't know it going on to the judgment and god will be the judge notice they they did this and these seeds now that did believe it watch what happened let's check some of them now abraham see let's take the hebrew children because they stood true and wouldn't tolerate with image worship they refused to bow down to an image that the king of the nation had made it was made after a holy man too the image of daniel showed that the gentile race was brought in under the false side of worshiping an image of a holy man it goes out the same way when people are being forced to worship images of people it come in by revelation of daniel being able to interpret the word that was wrote on the handwriting on the law that's the way it come in and that's the way it goes out the same way of the image of the gentiles notice they refused to do it what did they do they were abraham's seed standing true to the word and they possessed the gates of the enemy of fire they did it god's word's true daniel tested for the worship of one true god he was tested for that and in the time of tests he stood the test what did god do i had to look like the chips down for him as we would say and they didn't know what to do that was going to feed him to the line but daniel stayed true to the test of there's one true god amen and he possessed the gate of his enemy god closed the mouth of the lion moses stayed true to the promised word before the false impersonators jaberson james in the test look god had met him a supernatural told him to go do these things show these signs and each side would have a voice moses went right down this is true as he knows he throw down the sticks and it turned into a serpent you know what happened here come the impersonators and done the same thing now moses didn't throw his answer well i guess it's all wrong he stayed there and waited on god he stayed true no matter how many impersonators there was he stayed true and when he stayed true to his commission to bring those people out of that place when the watergate got in his way god let him possess it and he opened the gate by the pillar of fire that was leading him and tucked the people onto the promised land joshua another great leader only two out of went to the promised land joshua and caleb they came to a place called kadish which was the center of the world at that time in so much that was a judgment seat and all they sent out 12 spies to look at the land and 12 of them come back 10 of them thought oh it's too much of a job we just couldn't do it well that people we look like grasshoppers for the side of them but what does joshua do he's still the people he said wait a minute we're more than able to take us no matter how little we are how much in the minority what was he doing he was standing true to that promise i'll give you this land but you fight every inch of it you believe that mother god's giving you your healing but your fire inch of it everywhere the soldier your feet sets that i give you for possession footprints means possession it's all yours every promise belongs to you but you'll fight every inch of the way in and out now joshua knew what god said he was the seed of abraham he said i believe that that god gave us the land and we were more than able to take it and because he stood the test against the whole group of israelites all the tribes and all the people born and cried joshua said keep still god made the promise no matter how big the automotive opposition is and what the doctor said god give the promise it's up to god to do it what did he do when he come down to the river of jordan he possessed the gate that's what he did jericho closed up like a turtle in a shell what did he do he possessed the gate even one day when his enemy was trying to take him he possessed the gate of his enemy so much that he commanded the sun to stand still and the sun ovady and never turn for 24 hours god's true to his promise no matter what he has to do bankrupt the heavens before he let his word go defeated never made a promise that he can't keep i'm the lord heals all that is jesus if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen if thou canst believe all things are possible joshua believes it though god had to stop the earth from turning held it there but some other power his own power that the world never turned for 24 hours to joshua avenged himself upon his enemy he tucked the gates certainly he did god's ever true now i wish we had time to get to more heroes but we've got about 10 minutes now look all these precious heroes as they were great lawyers of faith they all died at the gate of death they all perished right at the gate of death then come on the royal seed of abraham they were all the natural seed from isaac but here come the royal seed of abraham which was christ abraham's seed of faith what we're supposed to be you see how whether we are or not the natural seed only was a type all others was born of natural birth but he come a virgin birth see that wasn't of the seed of abraham man a jew he come by the seed of faith of the promise and then we're supposed to be his children through this man watch what he did when he was on earth he conquered and possessed every gate the enemy had the royal sea he promised it by the word he conquered it he conquered the gate of sickness for us that's what he come to do remember sick people he conquered that gate you don't have to conquer it he conquered it the other man had to conquer their own gates but you don't have to conquer it's already conquered you conquered the gates of sickness and what did he do when he conquered the age of sickness saying that he would whatever you asked on earth and whatever you bound on earth he'd bind it in heaven give us the keys to the gate he conquered the gate of temptation by the word and the keys was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you he conquered it all conquered every sickness conquered death and he conquered hell he conquered death and hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they're the natural seed this is the spiritual scene he conquered the gates of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification and now we are more conquerors we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything's defeated oh my wish twice by science now maybe i feel twice as good we are disputing with a conquered enemy don't wonder if paul could say when he's building a block to chop his head off he said oh death where is your thing show me why you can make me squirmle and scream grave what is your victory and you think you'll mow me out there i'll point you to an empty world over there and i'm in heaven a defeated enemy the royal seat of abraham now the natural know what if paul could say when he's building a block to chop his head off he said oh death where is your thing show me why you can make me squirmle and scream great what is your victory and you think you'll mow me out there i'll point you to an empty world over there and i mean heal me raise me up to believe things a defeated enemy the royal seat of abraham now the natural seed cannot point to that but the royal sea can conquer already conquered for he has gone before us and conquered every gate party he's now after 2 000 years he stands in the midst of us the mighty conqueror not only did he conquer sickness he conquered sickness he conquered temptation he conquered every enemy he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and rose up against 2 000 years later here he stands among us this afternoon to identify himself a mighty conqueror amen still vindicating his promise royal seed of abraham oh my and the enemy shall he'll conquer the gates of his enemy those seeds he stands you're alive to vindicate himself to whom those predestinated seed that consists he conquered that who after his test of the promise of the word they were sealed by the holy ghost into the body of christ to them confirmed what hebrews 13 8 to be so they are sealed in there by the holy ghost that holy ghost which was by abraham foresaw it by faith he believed it and now we receive it looking back to the promise of what he said and john 14 12 is made confirmed in this last days by the risen conqueror of yourself not some system but a person christ the conqueror not my church not my baptist church or your presbyterian methodist or the pentecostals not by that but by jesus christ he lives today he rose over for our justification and because he lives he said we live also man don't live by bread alone but by every word not part of the word every word that proceeds out a mouth of god i am the resurrection of life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever leaveth and believeth in me shall never leave us doubt this take the gate of every enemy how can he conquer bosworth when god bosworth is in the conqueror that's where he said the happiest hour my life is right now he knowed that mighty conqueror his assurance rested with him oh my now we can sing living he love me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away one thing he justified freely forever someday he's coming all glorious day [Music] to those who are seen to be defeated eddie pruitt i believe it was he couldn't sell his christian songs nobody wanted they had nothing to do with it all defeated a believer one day the holy spirit came upon him the gate of his enemy that wouldn't receive his literature the spirit struck chunking and he grabbed the pen god let him write the inauguration song all hail the power of jesus name let angels prostrate paul bring forth the royal diet in a crowded crosby one time so what is it means to you some she didn't sell her birth rights like the pentecostal elvis presley did or like the church of christ booned in like the red foley did selling their talents to the world they got a fleet of cadillacs and million-dollar gold records but fanny crosby stayed true to the face she screamed out pass me the whole gentle savior hear my humble cry oh and others are calling do not pass me by thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom have i on earth beside your whom in heaven but these they said what if you're blind when you get to heaven she said i don't know how many of you said how [Music] you can make a million dollars she said i don't want the million dollars how are you knowing she said i shall know him i shall know him and redeem by his son i shall stand i shall know him i shall know him if i can't see him i'll feel for the male prince in his hand she conquered the gate of her enemy yes if you are in christ he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what tea you want ask what gates you want to take ask what you will and it shall be given to you if you abide me and my word abides in you you can take any enemy's gate that comes before you you're the royal seat of abraham what kind of a gate stands before you if it's sickness you're more than a conqueror then we can say saying this gracious old song every promise in the book is mine every chapter ever verses so divine i'm trusting in his love divine for every promise in the book is mine we are more than a conqueror and the seed of abraham shall possess the gate of the enemy when they say these things cannot happen when they want to call it a devil or blt above or something else god is sure to conquer every gate and take the enemy [Music] let us pray lord may the seed of abraham i know we'll see it lord how can that word fall without hitting that real ground i pray that they'll understand now may every person that comes in the prayer line be he lord if there be something here yet that has not as yet made their confession not stood publicly and stood for christ ready to deny all the creeds and the cold form of dead things let's take them away from you may they stand now and say i will accept him this might say here then you'll stand for them on that day while we have our heads down if there are those who would like to stand just a moment for prayer say i want to stand for him now that he'll stand for me at that day in his divine presence i ask you and give you the opportunity that your name be placed on the book of life if you will stand i'm not asking you to join any church i'm asking you to come to christ if you hear and do not know me god bless you son is there another say i i want to stand now god bless you ladies god bless you my sister i want god bless you god bless you i take my stand this afternoon these fine people men and women standing up i'll take my stand this afternoon and that day when the doctor says well the wreck blood shedding death is upon him up on her or some morning you'll remember your stand you stand for him now if you're ashamed of me before man i'll be ashamed of you before my father and the holy angels but if you'll confess me before man him will i confess before my father and the holy angel god bless you my sister there be some in the balcony somewhere right now while we're waiting some more more on the main floor [Music] all right i'll take it your word friend if the word falls on fertile ground like the little woman at the welsh she understood she was represented in heaven from the fat before the foundation of the world when that light struck it she recognized it god bless you my brother that's a gal god bless you my brother you might have done great things in your life you're doing the greatest thing you're ever going to do now stand for christ our heavenly father the seed has dropped on some ground this afternoon we see life springing up men and women standing their feet and their all-seeing eye of god who is omnipresent on that mission omnipotence sees them they are yours father i present them to you now as trophies made this experience to them standing there now knowing what they have done knowing what this means that they stand to take their stand with the large despised few may they ever remain true until that day they stand in your presence then that lovely voice will say yes one day in baton rouge or a little place called denim spring he stood for me father now i'll stand for him for her granted lord they're yours in jesus name amen god bless you for your stand god ever not do this one thing for me fine if you're around where these pastors are see if you talk to them if you haven't been baptized yet in christian baptism do so get yourself amongst believers now real believers not make believers real believers while we're praying let's pray for these handkerchiefs heavenly father these sanctions goes out now or i don't know maybe some old blind daddy's sitting out here in a little swamp somewhere waiting for this anxious to come a little baby land on a hospital bed a mother standing frantically waiting for the return of the handkerchief heavenly father i pray that you'll go with them and for a token of your presence today and our faith in you as we preach thy word may the faith that was in abraham and the faith that was produced and given to us by jesus christ may go with these handkerchiefs and heal everyone that is laid upon we send them in jesus name amen just a moment before we call the prayer line the omnipotent mighty god the grave on the all-sufficient one please friends uh i'm going to start praying for the sick and i probably want to come down uh i mind i get to say nothing to you so maybe you may go before that time whatever you are if you didn't even stand a while ago and you're not sure if you're a member of a church that's a good thing but that's not good enough see the rich young ruler was a member of the church and he asked jesus what could he do to have eternal life he never accepted it he walked away what a foolish thing for that young man to do don't take his place you remember the last time he was identified a little later he prospered he got richer he got to a place to even his barns bursting but then we find his last identification in hell flames tormenting don't don't let that happen to you accept christ you young people you young girls young boys this is the turning of life please do that hear me as as your brother one who loves you i'm here because i love you i love god and i love you and i cannot love god if i don't love you i'd love a lot brother if you had a comment to pass pass it on my son out there or one of my children let me just i'll go without it any parent will do that so god these lovish people love one another you said what are you scolding for genuine love is correct if your child is sitting on the street you say well there's a junior he ought to do that but i don't want to hurt his little feelings you don't love me you get killed there if you love him you'll bring him in and give him a spanking you'll make him obey that's the way god does love is corrected that's genuine love when a preacher standing let you women bob your hair and wear paint and stuff don't correct it there's no genuine love there won't call out let you man marry it three or four times all these other things and get by with it there's no genuine love there let you join a church and pat you on the back smother you some creed then that's all you have to join the holy church there's no love there or either a man so totally lost himself he don't see genuine love is corrective and brings you back to the word of god look at jesus how what he said because he loved them so much that he died in their place when he's even calling for his blood now may the great holy spirit i want to wait to see i'm waiting until the anointing of the holy spirit gets up on me before we get started i've been preaching thank you for your cooperation not each one in here wherever you are any word of building pray just for a minute say lord jesus help me help me let me touch your experiment jesus said you know when the woman touched his garment he didn't feel it physically but he turned around and knowed who she was and what she did he's the same jesus this afternoon a high priest can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity you believe each one of you now it is true that the god that made this promise once more may show it as we're living in the days of sodom how many believe that in the billing just raise up your hand we're living as it was in sodom the whole uh system has become polluted the world system everything the church system political system there's nothing politics is so corrupted the systems ever were dictators it's all corruption the church has become the same way families have become the same way it's just corruption sodom and remember god's got that before you then remember he said that he would represent himself in human flesh and would do like he did before sodom before the promised son came on the scene he promised to send one that would forerun that promised son as he did at the first place that would introduce and he said when the son of man is being revealed i don't know you but miss thompson that female troubling complications you believe that god will make you well can you believe it you will this thomas you believe he'll make you well raise up
