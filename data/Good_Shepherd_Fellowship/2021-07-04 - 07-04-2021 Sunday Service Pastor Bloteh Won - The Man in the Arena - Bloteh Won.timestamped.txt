[15:52] welcome brother
[15:55] [Music]
[16:03] okay all right god bless you saints
[16:09] uh you know when i when they struck my
[16:12] heart to actually give this testimony
[16:15] a thought kind of hit me like you know
[16:18] why do you always come to church and
[16:20] give testimonies why don't you just sit
[16:22] in your chair and
[16:24] you know be quiet and just let the
[16:26] service go on and
[16:28] you know all that you know and as soon
[16:29] as it hit me i'm just like you know the
[16:31] devil was busy
[16:32] you know and right after that thought
[16:34] another one just hit me like
[16:36] you know i know people don't come to
[16:38] church to hear me speak you know
[16:41] and but i know one thing you know people
[16:44] do come to church to hear
[16:45] about the glory of god and how good god
[16:48] is to his people
[16:49] you know so i was like even if nobody
[16:52] wants to hear
[16:53] me i would go outside and speak to the
[16:55] trees you know
[16:58] because i know after that conversation
[17:01] god had just sent a win and the tree to
[17:04] start dancing in that wind you know so
[17:07] um i
[17:10] i'm pretty sure most of you guys know
[17:12] about my friend who used to come with me
[17:14] often
[17:15] he was actually here when we got back
[17:17] when i got baptized
[17:19] and we were very close like you know
[17:21] anywhere i go he'd go with me anywhere
[17:23] he'd go i'm way i'm right with him
[17:26] you know and
[17:29] we kind of fell off a little bit as time
[17:31] went on
[17:32] i guess i just stopped doing certain
[17:34] things and he just kept on doing it so
[17:36] we just kind of
[17:37] kind of fell off there it's kind of sad
[17:41] but i understand why
[17:43] and i was at work the other day nikon
[17:46] i went to my locker open my locker and i
[17:49] seen like two missed calls from him
[17:52] i called him back i'm like how you doing
[17:55] you know
[17:55] how you doing brother you know he just
[17:57] kind of made fun of the way i talk and
[17:58] like man you sound like a square why you
[18:00] talk like that you know
[18:02] i'm like whatever how you doing and he's
[18:05] like um
[18:07] you could tell in his voice or like just
[18:09] the way he sounded that he was just kind
[18:11] of
[18:12] disturbed a little bit and he was like
[18:14] i'm good as the conversation went on he
[18:16] got to
[18:18] opening up maury he's like man i'm just
[18:20] tired
[18:22] of the way i'm living
[18:25] you know he's just like i'm just tired
[18:27] of the way my life is going
[18:30] and everything about it and he got to
[18:33] telling me how
[18:33] he's sleeping that you know he burnt the
[18:36] bridge with his mom he burnt the bridge
[18:37] with his
[18:38] pipes he burnt the bridge with his
[18:40] sisters and all that so he's sleeping at
[18:41] a park
[18:42] in uh in minneapolis and he told me the
[18:46] parking you know
[18:47] back in my days of rebellion i got very
[18:49] accustomed with that part too
[18:51] you know so you know it's true and
[18:54] i'm just like man um
[18:59] i i fell for him you know and he just he
[19:02] just asked me he's like what would you
[19:03] do if he was in my situation
[19:06] and i'm like now you asked me that what
[19:09] i do
[19:10] back then or what i'll do right now he's
[19:12] like i'm not trying to hear what you
[19:13] would have done back then i mean right
[19:14] now
[19:16] and i thought about it i'm like i got
[19:18] nowhere to go i got
[19:20] you know my family don't want me i'm at
[19:22] a park i got no job
[19:25] and it just hit me like i would pray
[19:27] like honestly that's exactly what i said
[19:28] i said i just pray to god
[19:30] and he was like man i'm not trying to
[19:32] hear that like come on
[19:33] like this is that like he kind of got
[19:35] mad he's like man i'm not trying to hear
[19:37] that what god gonna do for me how he
[19:38] gonna give me a place to sleep
[19:40] or a place to lay my head and this and
[19:43] that and just all sorts of stuff i'm
[19:45] like whoa
[19:46] you know he's like i'm not trying to
[19:48] hear that you gotta be one
[19:49] i'm like that is exactly what i would do
[19:52] you know and then
[19:53] you should really humble yourself and be
[19:56] sincere and pray to god and see what he
[19:58] would do for you
[19:59] it's like man i'm not trying to hear
[20:01] that kept on going on and on and he's
[20:03] just like
[20:05] i mean i pray but i don't know about
[20:07] being all sincere because i don't really
[20:09] you know
[20:10] feel like he's gonna do nothing for me
[20:12] and i just told him like if you're not
[20:14] sincere don't even do it i don't know if
[20:16] you know just like don't even do it
[20:17] because he's not gonna hear you if
[20:19] you're going to pray to god believe
[20:20] you're praying to god who's going to
[20:22] answer your prayers you know don't just
[20:24] pray to him and think it might happen it
[20:26] might not happen
[20:27] you know and when i said that the
[20:29] conversation just kind of went flat you
[20:30] know
[20:31] i guess he got kind of mad but like i
[20:33] was trying to be
[20:34] honest with him you know and a little
[20:37] bit later it kind of ended
[20:40] and just a week ago he texted me
[20:44] and he was like man what's up with you

[42:20] we will not be here for long we believe
[42:23] those who are keeping an eye on the
[42:24] scripture
[42:25] that is coming is very close let me
[42:28] share just one scripture
[42:30] uh from isaiah chapter 30
[42:33] verse 26 uh the fulfillment of a
[42:37] scripture here
[42:39] is isaiah chapter 30 verse 26.
[42:45] moreover the light of the moon shall be
[42:48] as the light of the sun and the light of
[42:51] the sun
[42:52] shall be seven folds as the light of
[42:56] seven days
[42:58] in the day that the lord bindeth up
[43:01] the breach of his people and
[43:05] he let the stroke of the wound we all
[43:08] know
[43:09] especially in the northwest and other
[43:11] places the
[43:12] so-called global warming or climate
[43:15] change
[43:18] people are dying from the heat and
[43:22] even the cnn this morning the headlines
[43:25] was
[43:26] about the heat wave across the united
[43:28] states
[43:29] and here the scripture is saying when
[43:32] the the sun shall be seven-fold
[43:36] as the light of seven days in the day
[43:39] when the lord
[43:41] bindeth up the breach of his people
[43:44] and we know that israel is back
[43:48] in the homeland as a direct fulfillment
[43:51] of scripture
[43:52] and prophecy whether it's from the book
[43:54] of isaiah
[43:56] is ezekiel from jeremiah chapter 31
[44:00] uh isaiah chapter 14 i'll bring my
[44:02] people back to their homeland
[44:04] it's a direct fulfillment of scripture
[44:06] and in that day when he makes and binds
[44:08] the wound of his people
[44:10] israel the sun shall be seven times
[44:13] harder
[44:14] and we see this happening right now so
[44:18] keep an eye on the word of god as we
[44:20] wait for his coming his promise rest
[44:22] assured
[44:24] he'll keep his promise when he said i go
[44:27] to prepare place
[44:29] in john chapter 14 verse 3 and i will
[44:31] return
[44:32] the return of christ is coming and also
[44:35] it's written in
[44:36] acceptance 1 11. the same jesus that you
[44:40] saw
[44:40] going up shall return again let us be
[44:43] ready to meet him
[44:45] as he comes god bless you brothers and
[44:47] sisters amen
[44:54] praise the lord amen i used that brother
[44:58] team to redeem myself i left
[45:00] my notes of the visitors in the office
[45:02] so
[45:04] i had to bring him up so i can redeem
[45:06] myself
[45:07] amen and we greeted our sister there
[45:10] sister mosukante sorry
[45:12] for mispronouncing your name and the
[45:14] brother year
[45:16] brother kwame hey brother kwame
[45:19] praise the lord good to have you
[45:21] visiting with us
[45:23] uh and we have our brother franklin
[45:27] uh he's uh he's uh
[45:30] uh partner in missions with me
[45:33] [Laughter]
[45:36] brother franklin is actually from alaska
[45:40] he works there with brother
[45:43] flynn take and brother andrew boscott in
[45:46] uh
[45:48] in the in the island area there he's uh
[45:50] one of the
[45:51] the minister brothers there but if you
[45:55] remember
[45:56] some time ago uh uh we
[45:59] were praying for him uh when his wife
[46:02] went to be with the lord
[46:05] and uh uh so
[46:08] just after that i called
[46:11] uh brother brett and at a high in my
[46:14] heart one day
[46:16] because we were good friends i mean we
[46:17] really bounded together one year
[46:20] when we went for the meeting in uh in in
[46:22] tucson
[46:23] but a dog baker meeting so we had to
[46:26] sleep together amen
[46:28] sleep in the same room so you know what
[46:30] it is
[46:31] it is that's fellowship to his highest
[46:34] heart
[46:35] you know fellowship is too fellow in the
[46:37] same shape but if they have to sleep
[46:40] together
[46:42] the lord so we had uh two double beds
[46:46] and we had to
[46:47] share the room so i mean we really spent
[46:49] time together and
[46:50] you know we just bound it so uh
[46:55] so after hearing the error i knew how
[46:57] how how difficult
[46:59] it would have been for him because i
[47:01] know how he and
[47:02] his wife were very very close and uh
[47:06] the last time we were there we visited
[47:09] her in the hospital
[47:10] pray with her before we left after the
[47:13] meeting that year
[47:15] but he pleased the law to take her home
[47:17] and then when i talked to brother flynn
[47:19] he told me how much
[47:20] you know brother franklin was was it was
[47:23] difficult for him
[47:25] and uh and he says well brother well i
[47:27] don't know if you would get him on the
[47:28] phone because even myself it's hard for
[47:30] me to get him on the phone
[47:32] and uh so i said well what we would do
[47:34] we would just pray you know
[47:36] and we were praying and until one day
[47:40] brother jordan
[47:41] uh sent a message from facebook
[47:44] to to me that a brother was making
[47:47] contact i think there were two
[47:49] two different person one from uganda and
[47:51] he also
[47:52] was making contact so as soon as i saw
[47:56] his message
[47:57] i said well if he if he's making contact
[47:59] then he's ready to talk
[48:02] so i took my phone and i called him
[48:03] immediately he answered the phone call
[48:06] and we spent some time on the phone and
[48:09] and
[48:10] then later on we talked again he told me
[48:12] he
[48:13] possibly will be visiting minnesota if
[48:16] things work out
[48:17] you know uh most of the brothers there
[48:21] they
[48:22] they are involved into uh
[48:25] artworks that works with their hands and
[48:27] you know
[48:28] they do some craft works and
[48:31] uh so some of his friends choose to pay
[48:35] his ticket
[48:36] for them to come down to minneapolis
[48:39] and he just thought that he would come
[48:40] and fellowship with us
[48:43] so in the plan that we had you remember
[48:46] last sunday i told you
[48:48] i was thinking that he and brother uh
[48:52] where is the brother name there
[48:55] oh my goodness
[48:59] he and brother olano who have done the
[49:02] test
[49:03] tested you know testimony today but
[49:06] because brother orlando tripp was caught
[49:08] shot so he had to go back so
[49:10] we had him testifying last
[49:14] sunday so we would call brother
[49:18] but franklin up he won he will share a
[49:21] little bit of
[49:22] uh how the lord miraculously brought him
[49:25] out of the struggle of his wife passion
[49:29] so
[49:29] come on sodium
[49:33] [Applause]
[49:39] god bless you god bless you
[49:43] i just want to share the um power of
[49:46] almighty god
[49:49] and through that i
[49:52] want to share a scripture with you and
[49:55] that is
[49:56] pertaining to this um testimony that i
[49:58] have
[49:59] with the passing of my wife and
[50:03] that scripture is in um
[50:06] it's in first john 3 and
[50:10] i wanted to read verse 2 and it says
[50:14] beloved now are we the sons of god
[50:17] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[50:20] be
[50:21] but we know that when he shall appear we
[50:24] shall be like him
[50:26] for we shall see him as he is
[50:31] and i want you to know that that
[50:34] scripture right there and this pertains
[50:36] to the healing of
[50:37] my wife passing away and it's i'm not
[50:40] gonna keep this long i'm here for the
[50:42] word
[50:43] you know i want to feed on the word and
[50:45] that's why i'm here and
[50:47] so that scripture is
[50:50] has got a mask like covet 19.
[50:55] it's sealed you know
[50:58] but but right now the way everything is
[51:00] going
[51:02] god is about to lift that scripture so
[51:04] that we can see him as he is because we
[51:07] are the word yeah
[51:08] you know we are the word made flesh and
[51:10] that scripture right there
[51:12] is that that transformation that is
[51:14] taking place right now
[51:16] that's in our hearts but is about to be
[51:18] made flesh
[51:20] yes and so um to make a long story short
[51:23] my wife passed away
[51:25] i went away from church you know i
[51:28] didn't want to talk to nobody absolutely
[51:29] nobody you know
[51:31] and death is something that's not easy
[51:34] you know everybody goes through it
[51:36] regardless you know healing is
[51:39] totally in many forms
[51:42] many uh different ways um
[51:46] and so to to this day
[51:50] um i went through like several months of
[51:53] uh grieving you know grieving and
[51:56] everybody goes through that
[51:57] some take 10 years some take a lifetime
[52:01] but by god's grace mine was eight months
[52:04] eight months total and
[52:07] what had happened was a friend of mine i
[52:10] was talking to nobody
[52:12] and they said
[52:15] you know you're building a wow
[52:18] around you i said how did you know that
[52:21] and they told me two other things
[52:23] that i knew that i was doing right
[52:25] within my heart
[52:27] and i said you can tell me anything you
[52:30] want you just told me what's in my heart
[52:32] i mean i don't care
[52:33] i mean uh and so what happened was
[52:36] um i went into a a meta friend
[52:39] they are biblically based uh program up
[52:43] in alaska
[52:44] and so they were we were talking
[52:48] and so we got to the discussion of my uh
[52:50] wife
[52:51] and um so
[52:54] they uh they we sat down and they said
[53:00] what would you say to yourself
[53:04] about the loss of your wife and
[53:07] i was the hardest
[53:11] i couldn't i couldn't grasp the words to
[53:14] come out
[53:16] and i just stayed there and i just
[53:18] started weeping
[53:20] you know and just started crying and
[53:24] everything
[53:25] and and again they asked
[53:29] what and there's nobody that can grieve
[53:33] for you
[53:33] like yourself that can feel sorry for
[53:36] you
[53:37] you know who you are everybody goes
[53:39] through
[53:40] different stages and
[53:44] so again they asked
[53:48] what did you say to yourself if you were
[53:51] sitting right next to you
[53:52] and i just and the words that
[53:56] came to me was i suffered a tremendous
[53:59] loss
[54:00] and i was set free right from my spoken
[54:04] i was ill
[54:04] i was healed instantly right there and i
[54:08] was just
[54:09] both healing and praising god came right
[54:11] at the same time
[54:13] and i'm telling you that scripture that
[54:16] says
[54:16] um we shall know him as he is that
[54:19] spirit there
[54:20] absolutely knows no death
[54:24] right yes and when we become that word
[54:26] we
[54:27] will absolutely know no death but that
[54:30] spirit has come
[54:31] unto me in that healing there and that
[54:34] it is as if there's absolutely no death
[54:36] happened
[54:38] you know that that's that's the kingdom
[54:40] that we're coming into
[54:42] and we're about to receive that that's
[54:44] right you know and so um
[54:46] what happened was right after that i
[54:48] just said lord i'm just gonna go out
[54:50] into the world you know and
[54:52] because jesus christ is in my heart and
[54:54] i'm just
[54:55] i'm not preaching or doing anything i'm
[54:57] just going out to the world and
[54:58] however people treat me is how they
[55:01] treat the lord jesus christ
[55:02] whether it's a cup of water however it
[55:05] is
[55:06] you know and i'm and you can do that to
[55:08] your friends too you don't have to
[55:09] preach to them your life is right there
[55:11] light
[55:12] you know you might be the only chance
[55:15] that they'll ever see god
[55:17] you might be the only chance they'll
[55:18] ever see god
[55:20] and so i and i hope brother one doesn't
[55:23] mind me saying this so what i want
[55:25] i'm almost done the first thing i did
[55:27] was i went to the uh
[55:29] and i don't recommend this don't do this
[55:31] you know i went to a ball game
[55:33] tournament for young
[55:34] people and because i used to play
[55:36] basketball before i
[55:37] came into the message and so i was
[55:41] coaching
[55:42] not not coaching but
[55:45] telling the team what to do and
[55:48] the uh the young ladies coach i i went
[55:52] to go talk to the team
[55:54] and i said you guys are a really good
[55:55] team you know and they said well nobody
[55:57] ever tells us that you know
[55:58] everybody says we're bad and the funny
[56:01] thing
[56:02] about it was when i was done they said
[56:04] um
[56:05] can you pray for us like oh my goodness
[56:08] you guys want me to pray for you guys
[56:09] i said i'm not here to pray for you guys
[56:11] but if you want a prayer you know i'll
[56:12] give you guys prayer
[56:14] and so i didn't know what to pray and i
[56:15] was like lord i commit their lives into
[56:18] your hands you know
[56:20] and right after that uh not too long
[56:22] after that one of the young people that
[56:24] i prayed for
[56:25] prayed for is in church now you know so
[56:29] the lord knows what he's doing and
[56:33] one of the things that happened during
[56:34] that tournament was
[56:36] i went out and i i told nobody what i
[56:39] was doing
[56:40] now this is the first time that i'm
[56:41] really telling my story you know
[56:44] and so we were sitting down
[56:47] and i was thinking lord i'm here you
[56:49] told me to come over here i'm here
[56:51] for a purpose and i was sitting at the
[56:54] morning table there was nobody
[56:56] i'm just waiting on the lord said well
[56:58] you brought me here so it's something
[57:00] got to happen
[57:01] so those coaches came of that
[57:04] that girl's uh ball team and the other
[57:08] people came and i was like
[57:09] starting to talk talk about our culture
[57:11] and tying the message
[57:13] in and and i said i want you to know how
[57:17] what brother andrew believes that pastor
[57:19] up in uh
[57:20] chivac and i was talking to them of what
[57:23] they believe
[57:25] and the lady one of the believers is a
[57:28] coach and the other one is her
[57:30] her best friend and as soon as i was
[57:34] done talking about what we exactly
[57:36] believe on the word
[57:37] that her best friend turned around to
[57:40] her friend and said
[57:42] i am so sorry for what i thought of you
[57:45] all these years
[57:46] her best friend he said she said i had a
[57:50] wrong conception
[57:52] of your belief and so i said thank you
[57:55] lord that's
[57:56] if that's all god wants me to do you

[1:06:41] the scripture
[1:06:42] always represent our manner of work
[1:06:45] the way we live praise the lord
[1:06:50] from the wilderness and this lebanon
[1:06:53] even on to the great river the river
[1:06:55] euphrates
[1:06:56] all the land of the head ties and onto

[1:07:12] as i was with moses so i will be
[1:07:16] with thee i will not filthy
[1:07:19] known for safety be strong
[1:07:24] and offer good courage praise the lord
[1:07:27] amen be strong of and offer good courage
[1:07:31] for unto these people shall thou divide
[1:07:34] for and inherit things
[1:07:36] the lamb we shall sword unto their
[1:07:38] fathers to give
[1:07:39] them only be thou strong and very
[1:07:43] courageous
[1:07:44] that thou merell observed to do
[1:07:47] according to
[1:07:48] all the lord which moses my seven
[1:07:50] commanded thee
[1:07:52] turn that from it to the right or to the
[1:07:55] left
[1:07:56] that thou nearer prospered where does
[1:07:59] whoever thou
[1:08:00] go with this book
[1:08:03] of the lord shall not depart out of thy
[1:08:06] mouth
[1:08:08] but thou shalt meditate therein
[1:08:12] day and night amen that thou married
[1:08:15] observed to do
[1:08:16] a calling to all that is written
[1:08:20] therein then shut down
[1:08:25] for them thou shalt make their ways
[1:08:27] prosperous
[1:08:29] and then thou shall have good success
[1:08:32] what a way to be successful
[1:08:35] have not commanded thee
[1:08:39] be strong and offer good courage this
[1:08:44] is the tear time that god
[1:08:48] is repeating this statement be strong
[1:08:51] and of a good courage and there is a
[1:08:53] reason why
[1:08:56] havana commodity be strong and of a good
[1:08:58] courage
[1:08:59] be not afraid neither be that dismay
[1:09:04] for the lord thy god is with thee
[1:09:08] where's whoever that goeth the lord
[1:09:11] bless you you can have your seat
[1:09:13] i believe the reason why god re-echoed
[1:09:16] that
[1:09:18] remember he's telling moses i will be
[1:09:20] with you i mean joshua i will be with
[1:09:22] you
[1:09:22] just like i was with moses but yet
[1:09:26] he's encouraging joshua to be strong
[1:09:29] and very courageous and uh
[1:09:33] you you see the thing about courage
[1:09:38] comes with conviction
[1:09:42] you cannot be courageous if you don't
[1:09:45] have a conviction
[1:09:49] praise the lord amen god promised him to
[1:09:53] be with joshua just like he will be with
[1:09:55] moses
[1:09:58] even though there's a promise but it's
[1:10:01] not
[1:10:01] exactly the same
[1:10:05] because when we look in the scripture
[1:10:07] it's not exactly the same
[1:10:11] for joshua god is not going to pull
[1:10:13] minor down from heaven
[1:10:15] just like he did for moses
[1:10:18] praise the lord joshua
[1:10:21] is going to have challenges
[1:10:25] now this was a leader moses was a leader
[1:10:28] that the people trusted
[1:10:32] the people struggle with his leadership
[1:10:35] because they knew his past
[1:10:37] how he ran from egypt killed a man and
[1:10:39] run away
[1:10:40] they struggled with that but when god
[1:10:42] came down and
[1:10:44] vindicated his seven praise the lord by
[1:10:47] opening the red seed and the people
[1:10:49] walking on dry
[1:10:50] ground and and turning the bitter water
[1:10:53] of mara
[1:10:53] into a drinking water for them bringing
[1:10:56] manor down from heaven
[1:10:57] it build the confidence of the people
[1:11:00] praise the lord and here's the people
[1:11:04] having confidence in this man the man
[1:11:07] that they know
[1:11:08] speak face to face with god
[1:11:12] and for you to have a boy like joshua
[1:11:16] that grew up on the his ministry
[1:11:19] now to step in his shoes
[1:11:23] that kind of did wrong with this thing
[1:11:25] it's okay
[1:11:27] to step in his shoes you see now the
[1:11:30] the the challenge that he's he's having
[1:11:33] because
[1:11:33] the expectation of the people is for him
[1:11:36] to
[1:11:36] to behave just like moses they expect
[1:11:40] him to preach
[1:11:41] just like moses they expect him to go
[1:11:43] and talk face-to-face with god
[1:11:45] just like moses now you see that's the
[1:11:48] reason why
[1:11:49] almighty god is coming down and
[1:11:52] encouraging joshua that you have to be
[1:11:56] strong and courageous
[1:11:59] praise the lord you have to stay with
[1:12:02] everything moses said but be strong
[1:12:04] and courageous i'm telling you to stay
[1:12:07] with this gospel
[1:12:08] that the apostle has preached you have
[1:12:10] to be strong
[1:12:12] encourage us in a doubtful age like this
[1:12:15] in a grooming age like this
[1:12:17] you have to be strong you you can't just
[1:12:20] say
[1:12:21] the bible say the bible say it no
[1:12:24] you have to be strong praise the lord
[1:12:28] you have to be strong as much as if
[1:12:31] nobody believe it i believe it
[1:12:33] if i would have to believe it and go to
[1:12:35] hell i believe it
[1:12:39] i believe it because god said it
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:42] praise the lord not because what the
[1:12:45] church interpreted to be
[1:12:47] but because god said it for you to be
[1:12:50] strong
[1:12:51] and courageous unique conviction
[1:12:56] praise the lord so god was kind of for
[1:12:58] giving
[1:12:59] uh joshua a little bit of a boss that he
[1:13:02] needed to be strong and courageous
[1:13:05] amen i don't know what
[1:13:08] you know better to preach for you on an
[1:13:10] independence day
[1:13:11] but i would just want to read a little
[1:13:13] bit here and and so we can be able to
[1:13:15] identify
[1:13:16] ourselves with this day independence day
[1:13:19] but ben
[1:13:20] said yet in identifying masterpiece
[1:13:24] he said whatever this nation
[1:13:28] is i am that's right
[1:13:32] so i landed on plymouth rock at a road
[1:13:36] with paul reveal i crossed the valley
[1:13:40] forge
[1:13:40] and in the icy river with george
[1:13:43] washington
[1:13:44] i was one of them american soldiers
[1:13:48] praise the lord that they didn't have
[1:13:51] any shoes to march against
[1:13:54] the british
[1:13:58] i had coffee that morning praise the
[1:14:02] lord
[1:14:04] then so in one way in reading this
[1:14:08] is uh again it's our way to
[1:14:12] naturally you know to to pledge our
[1:14:15] allegiance
[1:14:17] you know uh but there are some things
[1:14:19] that i'll share with you this morning
[1:14:22] by the help of the lord let me just go
[1:14:25] through this
[1:14:27] and he's identifying
[1:14:30] you know taking identity with uh with
[1:14:33] the natural land
[1:14:35] that god has given us
[1:14:38] this land this country
[1:14:41] that wants to as one of the greatest
[1:14:43] country in the world
[1:14:45] uh uh and and we know
[1:14:48] a lot of the parlor that uh runs
[1:14:52] uh between uh this country and in israel
[1:14:56] and all of that
[1:14:58] so he talks about this and uh uh
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:02] when i wrap my feet i've seen washington
[1:15:05] come out
[1:15:06] of the wilderness wet plum to his ways
[1:15:10] from praying all night i was there
[1:15:14] when it happened as to with stonewall
[1:15:17] jackson
[1:15:19] when the opposition was great enough in
[1:15:22] the
[1:15:23] and as he goes on and on
[1:15:27] he takes a position with this
[1:15:30] with with uh
[1:15:34] he's assigned a declaration of
[1:15:36] independence with
[1:15:37] thomas jefferson i rang the liberty bell
[1:15:41] july 4th 1776 i identified with her
[1:15:45] in hashem of the revolution
[1:15:48] when brothers fought against brothers
[1:15:50] father against son
[1:15:53] i have to be identified with hashem
[1:15:56] praise the lord amen
[1:16:00] and when you understand this when you
[1:16:02] understand this
[1:16:03] it helps you to embrace some of the
[1:16:05] things that the critics who said about
[1:16:07] this message
[1:16:09] praise the lord because you can never
[1:16:12] stand
[1:16:12] with her glory unless you embrace hashem
[1:16:17] praise the lord because in an at work
[1:16:20] before they entered the hall of fame it
[1:16:22] must go
[1:16:23] through the heart of critics praise the
[1:16:25] lord
[1:16:26] there are many people that want to just
[1:16:28] be identified with the glory of america
[1:16:31] and never want to be identified with
[1:16:33] with a shame when it comes to regime
[1:16:35] then we talk about racist we talk about
[1:16:37] sexy we talk about the rest of
[1:16:39] everything
[1:16:40] but that's that's all what makes a
[1:16:42] nation
[1:16:43] that's what all that makes an individual
[1:16:46] i was there with thomas jefferson
[1:16:48] running the liberty bell
[1:16:49] identified with her in hashim of the
[1:16:51] revolution when brother fought against
[1:16:54] brother
[1:16:54] and fathers against son i have to be
[1:16:57] identified in hashem the same
[1:16:59] as i have to be identified in her glory
[1:17:02] that's exactly right
[1:17:05] i was awake island when all the soldiers
[1:17:09] lost their life i've seen them
[1:17:11] i've seen them when
[1:17:14] they took with alain i helped hosted the
[1:17:17] flag i've gone sent
[1:17:19] certainly all she was
[1:17:23] and all she ever
[1:17:26] they do all she
[1:17:29] is now i proudly say
[1:17:32] i'm a part of her because
[1:17:36] i'm glad to be an american
[1:17:39] to be a christian you must be the same
[1:17:43] amount
[1:17:44] praise the lord amen you must be the
[1:17:48] same
[1:17:51] if i'm a christian then i preach the
[1:17:53] gospel
[1:17:54] 120 years with noah and
[1:17:57] in his judgment i was with moses at the
[1:18:00] burning bush and the crossing of the red
[1:18:02] sea
[1:18:03] joshua at the word of jericho and when
[1:18:06] the captain of the lord host met
[1:18:07] him i was with the judges i was with the
[1:18:10] kings i was
[1:18:11] in the books of the prophets
[1:18:14] i'm identified with him in his death
[1:18:18] praise the lord i died with him when he
[1:18:22] died at calvary
[1:18:24] and that's why paul says in romans
[1:18:26] chapter 6
[1:18:28] shall we continue in sin that grace
[1:18:30] might abound
[1:18:32] knowing that there are many of us that
[1:18:34] were baptized
[1:18:36] were baptized in his death
[1:18:39] praise the lord amen i mean you can take
[1:18:42] the church name
[1:18:43] you can claim to be a a christian and
[1:18:46] identify with a denomination
[1:18:48] but if you were not baptized if you
[1:18:51] never took on the name of jesus christ
[1:18:53] in baptism you are not identified with
[1:18:56] his death
[1:18:58] praise the lord to have a promise
[1:19:02] of a resurrection you must have
[1:19:05] an identification of a death and burial
[1:19:10] praise the lord i'm identified in his
[1:19:13] death i die with him when he died at
[1:19:15] calvary
[1:19:16] i rose again on easter morning with him
[1:19:20] in the power of his resurrection i'm a
[1:19:23] witness
[1:19:26] of it tonight i die with him at calvary
[1:19:30] raised with him on easter hallelujah to
[1:19:32] be a part of him i had to be identified
[1:19:34] with him
[1:19:36] i identify with him in his death
[1:19:39] identify with him in his
[1:19:41] suffering amen praise the lord and
[1:19:44] peter taught us james as well taught us
[1:19:48] that's why we go through trials
[1:19:52] is to be identified with him in his
[1:19:54] suffering
[1:19:57] praise the lord amen we go through
[1:20:00] trials
[1:20:01] and different trials of our life
[1:20:04] sometimes you
[1:20:05] think that it is it is you that god is
[1:20:08] taking an
[1:20:09] issue with no it's not you you are just
[1:20:12] partaking you are partaking
[1:20:18] of his suffering praise the lord
[1:20:22] it's not your suffering it's his
[1:20:23] suffering
[1:20:26] and you are just partaking of faith
[1:20:30] and sometimes we complain as if it is
[1:20:32] our suffering
[1:20:33] i'm suffering too much it's not your
[1:20:36] suffering
[1:20:39] it's his suffering praise the lord
[1:20:44] identify with him in suffering i was
[1:20:47] with him there
[1:20:49] in death raised with him in the
[1:20:52] resurrection
[1:20:57] and i was with 120 that claim up into
[1:21:00] the opera room
[1:21:02] i witnessed the mighty russian wing
[1:21:07] coming from heaven
[1:21:10] praise the lord
[1:21:16] in the book of romans paul taught the
[1:21:18] same
[1:21:20] you see everything that god does
[1:21:23] god paul in the book of hebrews said
[1:21:27] god works were finished from the
[1:21:28] foundation of the word
[1:21:31] which of course we know that foundation
[1:21:33] of the world was in god's mind because
[1:21:35] he thought of
[1:21:36] everything before he made it praise the
[1:21:39] lord
[1:21:40] so he said that
[1:21:43] so when god thought of everything in his
[1:21:46] mind
[1:21:47] the way he could do it to display it was
[1:21:50] by representation
[1:21:54] praise the lord amen
[1:21:57] he he set up setting
[1:22:01] individuals let me see that way and then
[1:22:05] he did representation now you will see
[1:22:08] in romans that's the reason
[1:22:10] why paul said by one man's sin
[1:22:14] we were all condemned representation
[1:22:19] and by the death of one man
[1:22:22] we are being redeemed
[1:22:26] praise the lord so everything that's the
[1:22:29] reason why
[1:22:30] uh god put the heavenly bodies
[1:22:35] the son to be able to govern
[1:22:39] the bottom in life and when he did the
[1:22:42] moon
[1:22:43] and the stars they were able to
[1:22:46] to to to control
[1:22:49] life that we don't see
[1:22:51] [Music]
[1:22:54] the moon and a star they control the
[1:22:56] ties of the sea
[1:23:00] praise the lord amen so the control
[1:23:06] life that we don't see why the sun
[1:23:10] controls the visible life the plants the
[1:23:12] flower the fruits and everything
[1:23:14] we can see it glory be to god
[1:23:21] are we together so you see that's that's
[1:23:24] the way that
[1:23:25] god designed his creation
[1:23:29] he designed it that way
[1:23:33] praise the lord amen also when you
[1:23:37] when you even bring it into time you
[1:23:39] will realize that
[1:23:40] uh the the the uh uh
[1:23:43] you know you talk about you talk about
[1:23:45] miracle you talk about
[1:23:47] healing you talk about the things that
[1:23:49] happen the wonders that happen
[1:23:51] the work of jesus christ you know when
[1:23:53] those things happen
[1:23:55] we give glory to god because we know
[1:23:57] that is the work of jesus christ
[1:23:59] but you see the power of the church
[1:24:03] the power of the gathering of the saints
[1:24:06] control the unseen word
[1:24:14] they control the unseen word
[1:24:17] the devil and his demons know
[1:24:21] that we are not yet this morning to play
[1:24:23] church
[1:24:25] they know that we are not striving to a
[1:24:27] religion
[1:24:28] there is one reason why we are here is
[1:24:30] because of this bleeding word
[1:24:32] saturn knows that he knows when a man is
[1:24:36] playing church
[1:24:37] and he knows when a man has a conviction
[1:24:44] so you see that's the reason why jesus
[1:24:46] says i will build my church
[1:24:49] and the gifts of hell the unseen
[1:24:52] powers of hell will never prevail
[1:24:55] against it
[1:25:02] praise the lord oh my
[1:25:09] so we are identified this morning
[1:25:13] amen but
[1:25:16] for the just for the a little message
[1:25:21] i want to use a statement
[1:25:25] i want to use a statement
[1:25:30] of uh theodore
[1:25:34] roosevelt
[1:25:39] april 23 1910
[1:25:44] he was over in france just after he came
[1:25:47] out of power
[1:25:48] 1909 he was traveling
[1:25:53] the world and it was over in france
[1:25:57] and he gave a speech that is called
[1:26:00] the citizen in the republic
[1:26:04] praise the lord this will give us a full
[1:26:07] side of something i want for us to look
[1:26:09] at
[1:26:10] a little bit since we are talking since
[1:26:13] his independence
[1:26:14] let's talk about the man that fought for
[1:26:15] independence

[1:26:26] captain of all captain amen
[1:26:28] he fought for our independence praise
[1:26:30] the lord
[1:26:33] but mr roosevelt said this he says it is
[1:26:36] not the critics
[1:26:38] who count not the man
[1:26:42] who point out how
[1:26:45] the strong man stumble
[1:26:49] oh we're the doer of these who have done
[1:26:53] them better
[1:26:55] praise the lord you know it's the guy
[1:26:57] that is in the stand that knows how to
[1:26:58] play the game better
[1:27:00] than the guy that is on the page are you
[1:27:03] supposed to pass the bar
[1:27:13] the credit belongs to the man who is
[1:27:16] actually in the arena
[1:27:20] so i'm going to speak about the man in
[1:27:22] the arena
[1:27:24] the credit belongs to the man
[1:27:27] who is actually in the fight
[1:27:32] the credit belongs to the man who is
[1:27:35] actually
[1:27:36] going through the trial
[1:27:42] the credit belongs to the woman
[1:27:46] that is going through whatever
[1:27:50] you are going through praise the lord
[1:27:54] the credit belongs to the man who is
[1:27:56] actually in the arena
[1:27:59] who face is mild by dust
[1:28:03] and sweat and blood
[1:28:08] praise the lord
[1:28:16] who strife heavenly
[1:28:20] who earth who comes shot again and again
[1:28:24] hallelujah because there is no
[1:28:28] effort with our error or
[1:28:31] shortcoming
[1:28:37] but but who does actually strive to do
[1:28:40] the day
[1:28:44] who knows
[1:28:47] every time i read this it's
[1:28:50] it's just it just it do something
[1:28:52] special to me
[1:28:54] praise the lord the man
[1:28:58] in the arena praise the lord
[1:29:05] he was called the citizen of of a
[1:29:08] republic
[1:29:09] when he made a speech but then they turn
[1:29:12] it
[1:29:12] the brain into the man in the arena
[1:29:16] that's that's what is known all through
[1:29:17] the years
[1:29:19] the man who spent himself in warfare
[1:29:22] cause
[1:29:24] who are the best knows
[1:29:28] in the end the triumph
[1:29:31] is hard achievement
[1:29:34] and who are the worst if if he failed
[1:29:38] at least feel what daring
[1:29:42] greatly so that his place
[1:29:46] shall never be with those cold
[1:29:49] and timid soul who never
[1:29:53] know victory no defeat
[1:29:56] you got to be in a fight for you to know
[1:29:59] victory or defeat you don't know it by
[1:30:02] reading books
[1:30:04] you don't know victory and defeat by
[1:30:06] listening to tapes
[1:30:08] you got to be in the fight for you to
[1:30:11] know
[1:30:12] victory or defeat amen
[1:30:18] praise the lord
[1:30:22] so i speak on the man in the arena
[1:30:27] but before that i will read this clause
[1:30:30] of thomas jefferson
[1:30:32] in the declaration of independence
[1:30:37] we hold this truth to be self-evident
[1:30:41] that all men
[1:30:42] are created equal
[1:30:46] that they are endowed by their creator
[1:30:51] with setting on uh
[1:30:55] alienable rights that among these
[1:30:58] alive liberty in the pursuit of
[1:31:02] happiness
[1:31:04] and i came across this other statement
[1:31:07] that he made
[1:31:08] many years after
[1:31:11] thomas jefferson again he says indeed
[1:31:15] i tremble for my country
[1:31:19] when i reflect that god is just
[1:31:24] that his justice cannot sleep forever
[1:31:32] commerce between man and slave
[1:31:39] you know you think about this it helps
[1:31:42] you to see the frame of
[1:31:44] mind that those men live
[1:31:47] in we are in a society
[1:31:50] they have straighted no longer no matter
[1:31:53] how the people
[1:31:54] cry for liberty than cry for right they
[1:31:58] are now honored the right inspiration
[1:32:02] they can run down the street and stream
[1:32:04] for every right
[1:32:05] and and and throw money man down and
[1:32:08] says all of these people were slave
[1:32:10] master
[1:32:11] they are not in the right frame of mind
[1:32:13] because they are not under the right
[1:32:14] anointing
[1:32:15] none of these men were ever in the arena
[1:32:26] he said i tremble for my country
[1:32:31] when i reflect that god is just
[1:32:34] in his justice do not sleep
[1:32:39] praise the lord
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:48] so this morning we want to talk on the
[1:32:51] man that
[1:32:52] in the arena i have a
[1:32:55] uh a devotional that i
[1:33:00] bought some time ago
[1:33:05] it's called wall and picnic
[1:33:10] you know yeah brother branham says we
[1:33:12] are not on a picnic we're on a
[1:33:13] battlefield
[1:33:14] and sometimes i think in my mind that he
[1:33:17] you know he got that inspiration from
[1:33:19] some of these materials
[1:33:21] you'll realize that even this one bro we
[1:33:23] we say brother branham said you know he
[1:33:25] says
[1:33:26] if god do not judge this country he will
[1:33:29] raise up
[1:33:30] sutton and gomorrah do you realize that
[1:33:32] statement was actually a billigram that
[1:33:34] said it
[1:33:35] if you set your message you will see
[1:33:37] brother branham quoting billy graham
[1:33:39] but it turned to be like you know
[1:33:41] message preachers we just think that
[1:33:42] brother branham said everything
[1:33:45] praise the lord we think that he said
[1:33:48] everything
[1:33:50] hallelujah he was a man with his poor
[1:33:53] education
[1:33:54] he loved to read hallelujah
[1:34:02] are we together glory be to god
[1:34:06] now reading this uh uh
[1:34:10] uh um
[1:34:14] identifying with the usa that there's
[1:34:17] this uh
[1:34:18] there's a there's there's a phrase here
[1:34:20] that came up uh in this in this portion
[1:34:22] of the quote
[1:34:23] what brother branham says i was there
[1:34:25] when it happened as to
[1:34:27] with stonewall jackson stonewall jackson
[1:34:32] you know uh
[1:34:35] got the name stonewall
[1:34:39] because of
[1:34:45] the brave heart that he had praise the
[1:34:48] lord
[1:34:53] but when you read the story you realize
[1:34:56] that
[1:34:58] the brigade general that was leading
[1:35:01] his team taught that he was a cow
[1:35:06] for the matter of fact stonewall jackson
[1:35:10] uh they call him they have a name here
[1:35:18] because general thomas jackson that was
[1:35:22] his name
[1:35:23] was the artillery teacher at virginia
[1:35:26] military institute
[1:35:29] known as the rage he was a boring
[1:35:33] instructor
[1:35:36] he was given the name the nickname
[1:35:40] tom food
[1:35:44] he was giving the name the nickname
[1:35:47] tongue food
[1:35:48] by his students behind his back
[1:35:53] but one time in uh 1861 general jackson
[1:35:59] was in the command
[1:36:03] there in virginia it was 10 miles
[1:36:06] away from the nation capital the smoke
[1:36:10] and the noise of the artillery
[1:36:12] was going on it was difficult to tell
[1:36:16] one from the other some of the rebels
[1:36:19] until
[1:36:20] uh
[1:36:23] you know the the the stall the
[1:36:26] the the uniform of the union officers so
[1:36:29] people were disguising and serving is
[1:36:31] hakutel
[1:36:32] there was another officer the brigade
[1:36:35] general
[1:36:36] benell b from south carolina
[1:36:43] and
[1:36:47] general b saw what was about to happen
[1:36:52] and told general jackson the enemy are
[1:36:55] driving us
[1:36:58] general jackson replied then sir
[1:37:01] we will give them the bonnet
[1:37:08] praise the lord
[1:37:11] we are talking about independence people
[1:37:13] just bear with me
[1:37:18] so uh general b exotic his troop
[1:37:23] to reform shouting there is
[1:37:26] jackson standing like a stone wall
[1:37:36] let us determine to die here or we will
[1:37:39] conquer rally behind virginia
[1:37:45] glory be to god and many times as the
[1:37:50] history goes
[1:37:55] general jackson just had a way
[1:38:00] of learning to say a prayer before he
[1:38:02] get into the battle
[1:38:05] so no matter how tough
[1:38:08] the battle was he could be right in the
[1:38:10] midst of a very serious firing and he
[1:38:13] would just stand there and pray
[1:38:18] that is bravery
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:21] when you hear don't sign you run
[1:38:24] but for the man to just stand there and
[1:38:28] pray
[1:38:30] praise the lord and this
[1:38:33] general bee died in that battle
[1:38:37] and stonewall jackson was the one
[1:38:41] that saved the virginia army
[1:38:45] praise the lord so he name changed
[1:38:49] from tom full to stonewall jackson
[1:38:54] glory be to god amen
[1:38:59] i just think that whatever
[1:39:02] christian faith he had was very all to
[1:39:06] the people around him
[1:39:07] [Music]
[1:39:09] that when he stand to pray people just
[1:39:11] think he's being idle
[1:39:16] praise the lord as a general he must be
[1:39:20] running he must be giving instruction
[1:39:22] but
[1:39:22] i mean he just get himself in that
[1:39:24] condition
[1:39:26] praise the lord
[1:39:29] there's another account about
[1:39:34] a chaplain that was always
[1:39:37] you know he was very strong on
[1:39:39] predestination
[1:39:41] i love this one you know
[1:39:44] and one time they got into a fight
[1:39:47] and this uh young copper sodium saw the
[1:39:50] chaplain hiding behind the tree
[1:39:53] and he said he said stop praying
[1:40:00] why are you hiding i believe you are
[1:40:02] predestinated
[1:40:07] why are you hiding behind the tree
[1:40:11] the chaplain kept quiet he had to put
[1:40:14] his talk together
[1:40:15] he said boy i believe this tree was
[1:40:18] predestinated to be here
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:30] amen i don't know what you were
[1:40:32] expecting today so
[1:40:37] glory be to god
[1:40:41] but we want to talk about the man in the
[1:40:44] arena
[1:40:46] glory be to god praise the lord
[1:40:50] because it's the man that is in the
[1:40:53] arena
[1:40:55] that the credit belongs to
[1:40:58] it's the man that is wearing the shoes
[1:41:01] that knows the pain at the one that is
[1:41:05] going through that
[1:41:07] i mean you can have all the smart idea
[1:41:12] praise the lord and all the wonderful
[1:41:16] advices
[1:41:18] but it's the one that is going through
[1:41:21] the one that is in the midst of them
[1:41:36] i found another statement here of john f
[1:41:39] kennedy
[1:41:41] it was a statement in his inauguration
[1:41:44] speech
[1:41:45] that was also highly
[1:41:49] appreciated when he said
[1:41:53] the importance of civil action
[1:41:57] and public service
[1:42:01] he says ask not what your country can do
[1:42:05] for you
[1:42:08] ask yourself what you can do for your
[1:42:12] country
[1:42:15] and he challenged every every american
[1:42:18] to contribute in some way
[1:42:20] to the public good amen
[1:42:25] let me let me drive this with a little
[1:42:27] bit
[1:42:29] you realize that the forni fathers
[1:42:32] never brought a democracy to this
[1:42:36] country
[1:42:38] what actually they fought for was a
[1:42:40] republic
[1:42:42] and there is a difference between the
[1:42:45] republic
[1:42:46] and the democracy praise the lord
[1:42:54] a republic is a state in which supreme
[1:42:58] power is held
[1:43:00] by the people and they are elected
[1:43:04] representative democracy
[1:43:09] is assist him
[1:43:12] that's what i want for you to see a
[1:43:15] system
[1:43:18] is a system
[1:43:23] praise the lord amen
[1:43:27] this man can be in that party and this
[1:43:29] other person in
[1:43:30] as long as net as long as we are not
[1:43:34] democrat is not right
[1:43:39] amen as long as we are not republican
[1:43:43] and republican are doing it it's not
[1:43:44] right
[1:43:45] it's a system
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:51] is the system that govern the people you
[1:43:54] will see the very same thing when you
[1:43:55] come to
[1:43:56] understand how denominationalism work
[1:44:00] it's a system
[1:44:06] that is the difference let me show you a
[1:44:09] scripture
[1:44:10] isaiah chapter 33
[1:44:15] verse 22.
[1:44:24] the lord is our judge
[1:44:29] the lord is our lord giver
[1:44:34] the lord is our king
[1:44:38] and he will save us do you realize
[1:44:43] that the three branches of government
[1:44:47] is represented in thee
[1:44:55] praise the lord
[1:44:59] the lord is our george
[1:45:06] that is the
[1:45:09] judiary government branch of government
[1:45:13] the lord is our lawmaker the legislative
[1:45:17] branch of government the lord is our
[1:45:19] king
[1:45:20] that is the highest office the executive
[1:45:23] branch of government
[1:45:26] it goes to show that
[1:45:32] the men there designed these things
[1:45:38] with god fearing heart and the earnesty
[1:45:41] that they hold
[1:45:41] in their hearts to be able to serve the
[1:45:45] people
[1:45:47] was honor inspiration
[1:45:54] they might have not have known this
[1:45:55] scripture i don't know if they knew it
[1:45:57] or not
[1:45:59] but just to show
[1:46:03] the prophet isaiah said this hundreds of
[1:46:10] years
[1:46:13] before those men came here
[1:46:17] but just to be able to see that they
[1:46:20] were able to break the
[1:46:21] governance of the people
[1:46:26] and it fits right into scripture
[1:46:32] it shows where their heart was
[1:46:36] their heart was to save the people
[1:46:43] not to push their agenda but to self the
[1:46:47] people
[1:46:53] praise the lord is the man
[1:46:57] that's in the arena the credit goes to
[1:47:03] praise the lord people want to get on
[1:47:06] the internet and
[1:47:08] i mean they want to see whatever they
[1:47:09] want to see about the message
[1:47:11] they want to say whatever they need and
[1:47:13] whatever their grandparent told them
[1:47:15] whatever they read whatever they search
[1:47:17] out
[1:47:20] i mean it's their business
[1:47:23] this is what i've always said now
[1:47:26] studying this morning i came across
[1:47:28] something
[1:47:29] and i read it was really a blessing to
[1:47:30] me because my mind has always channeled
[1:47:32] in that way
[1:47:34] and and is this you can
[1:47:37] never be able to destroy
[1:47:42] what you have believed now this is what
[1:47:46] people don't know about belief
[1:47:48] belief is more than a mental thing
[1:47:53] belief is something that lies in your
[1:47:55] subconscious
[1:47:57] yes
[1:48:01] and more and more of the real thing
[1:48:04] of life and the real thing that concerns
[1:48:07] you
[1:48:08] lie in your subconscious
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:12] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:48:15] the first time you told a lie the first
[1:48:17] time
[1:48:18] you drink the first time you did things
[1:48:20] anything
[1:48:21] you never forget about it why because
[1:48:24] it goes and resident in your
[1:48:27] subconscious
[1:48:30] even if you you ask the lord for
[1:48:33] forgiveness the law forgive you
[1:48:35] but it does not leave you why because
[1:48:38] that is an important truth of your life
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:43] nobody can come and tell you anything
[1:48:46] different
[1:48:47] because you were there you knew what
[1:48:50] happened
[1:48:55] so you see it is it is much easier
[1:48:59] for you to say it like the way it
[1:49:02] happened
[1:49:03] so what happened is that you are
[1:49:05] bringing this natural body
[1:49:07] to merge with that truth that is lying
[1:49:10] in your subconscious
[1:49:11] because if you don't see it the way it
[1:49:13] happened
[1:49:15] every time you say you were jack because
[1:49:17] your subconscious is witnessing
[1:49:20] that what you are saying is not true
[1:49:27] every time you say you you shiver or you
[1:49:29] look over your shoulder
[1:49:31] it shows that there is there is there is
[1:49:34] a problem in the image
[1:49:37] it can be the most horrible thing
[1:49:41] you might say it people will sit down
[1:49:43] they might be angry with you they will
[1:49:44] frying up with you and
[1:49:46] and this but the peace that you feel
[1:49:48] with inside
[1:49:51] can never be expressed
[1:49:59] your subconscious holds
[1:50:03] your reality
[1:50:08] praise the lord so for you to
[1:50:12] for you to destroy what you believe
[1:50:17] the best way to do it is to find
[1:50:20] something
[1:50:22] better
[1:50:24] is to find something better
[1:50:28] praise the lord oh that's the reason why
[1:50:31] we can we can we can talk about our past
[1:50:35] life
[1:50:35] we can condemn sin you we we can say why
[1:50:38] because we have found something better
[1:50:42] the life of christ is better than our
[1:50:44] first birth
[1:50:46] praise the lord amen it's not
[1:50:49] it's not difficult for us to go down
[1:50:51] into our family past and talk about
[1:50:53] some family strengths and family habits
[1:50:56] in my family that like to see they like
[1:50:58] to lie
[1:50:58] it's not hard to do that because you
[1:51:00] have found something
[1:51:04] that is better
[1:51:09] when you find people trying to protect
[1:51:12] family
[1:51:12] integrity
[1:51:18] the fountain of the new birth needs to
[1:51:20] flow down that stream
[1:51:21] [Laughter]
[1:51:23] if they start struggling to to protect
[1:51:32] family
[1:51:36] and if you cannot find something that is
[1:51:39] better
[1:51:42] you always be fighting
[1:51:46] what you have known to be the truth
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:51] you'll always be fight you'll be looking
[1:51:53] in there for error you'll just be
[1:51:54] looking for one
[1:51:55] error or another error because you are
[1:51:57] not actually living that thing
[1:52:00] because it has been part of you
[1:52:04] praise the lord let me give you a good
[1:52:07] story
[1:52:08] or a good scene
[1:52:11] a scene in teenage life
[1:52:16] boy grow up and know that this is his
[1:52:18] dying you know his father
[1:52:20] as a young boy you know the kickball
[1:52:22] they run around and
[1:52:23] and uh the dad said papi he said yes
[1:52:26] daddy he wronged
[1:52:27] when he started getting out to a teenage
[1:52:29] life
[1:52:30] he's he's trying to look for personal
[1:52:34] identity
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:37] and looking for that personal identity
[1:52:41] sometimes he rebelled against the
[1:52:44] principle he was taught
[1:52:47] peer pressure clicks in but the truth
[1:52:50] about the mata there is that
[1:52:52] there is no way he can wipe out his
[1:52:54] parents
[1:52:55] the truth about the matada is that the
[1:52:58] gene
[1:52:59] of that man a woman still flows through
[1:53:01] down his being
[1:53:02] even though he's struggling with the way
[1:53:04] i don't want to be like damn
[1:53:06] i mean yeah life is just boring man
[1:53:08] those are the little people that you're
[1:53:09] boring
[1:53:17] so he gets into that struggle and he's
[1:53:20] looking around that and sees yeah i mean
[1:53:23] yeah they don't have this and they don't
[1:53:25] have this he's looking for
[1:53:27] but he's not going anywhere
[1:53:30] because it took 23 chromosomes here
[1:53:35] 23 chromosomes here the doctor is in the
[1:53:38] house if i'm wrong you meet me in the
[1:53:40] office
[1:53:43] praise the lord
[1:53:46] he's not going anywhere that that child
[1:53:48] is not going anywhere
[1:53:50] you see and that is the reason why
[1:53:53] the parent reaction to that child is not
[1:53:56] to fight with them
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:00] you just have to believe that they are
[1:54:01] not going anywhere unless you stole that
[1:54:04] child from the hospital but if you are
[1:54:08] the one that gave birth to that child
[1:54:11] you have to believe that they are not
[1:54:12] going anywhere
[1:54:18] oh praise the lord i'm talking about a
[1:54:20] man that is in the arena
[1:54:22] the one that is going through it glory
[1:54:25] be to god
[1:54:26] amen my my my mind
[1:54:31] you will either have to find something
[1:54:33] better
[1:54:34] and if that which you have find is truth
[1:54:37] it will cut you away
[1:54:39] from all your error because the word
[1:54:42] corrects the error
[1:54:44] amen it will just slay you away from all
[1:54:47] your errors
[1:54:48] and it starts to bring you transform you
[1:54:51] into that truth praise the lord
[1:54:55] amen and that's the reason why you find
[1:54:58] people over the years
[1:54:59] uh i mean the the they believe the law
[1:55:02] they are
[1:55:02] trying to walk into into uh into light
[1:55:06] and the fullness of life
[1:55:08] but but they are just some things
[1:55:10] they've been taught
[1:55:12] that is just invalid in their
[1:55:14] subconscious
[1:55:16] it's so hard for them to get away from
[1:55:17] it
[1:55:19] praise the lord you you i mean they read
[1:55:22] the word you show them the word and say
[1:55:24] oh i see it brother you know i see it
[1:55:26] but that thing is just there yes sir
[1:55:31] so for that individual to become a
[1:55:33] personal battle
[1:55:35] that they have to fight as they go along
[1:55:38] the glory there
[1:55:39] is that the way you can know that god is
[1:55:42] on your side
[1:55:43] is when he has identified that thing
[1:55:46] god picking up something in your life or
[1:55:49] exposing something in your life is not
[1:55:50] to embarrass you
[1:55:52] it's god's way to identify himself with
[1:55:55] your struggle
[1:55:58] praise the lord is his way to identify
[1:56:01] himself
[1:56:02] which means he has got in the fight with
[1:56:04] you
[1:56:05] because redemption is a partnership
[1:56:08] amen he has brought us to a partnership
[1:56:11] he paid the price he want us to push the
[1:56:14] enemy out of the lane
[1:56:16] and he never left us to us alone praise
[1:56:19] the lord
[1:56:20] amen he ever said that he's telling
[1:56:22] joshua
[1:56:23] everywhere the soul of your feet shall
[1:56:26] stand i have given it to you
[1:56:30] but yet they will have to fight for
[1:56:32] every inch of ground
[1:56:34] and god never left him alone he said i
[1:56:37] would send hornets
[1:56:38] to fight for you i'll send my angel
[1:56:40] before you and even god
[1:56:42] became a man the captain of the lord
[1:56:44] host
[1:56:46] he put himself in the battle
[1:56:49] praise the lord amen
[1:56:54] that's why he told joshua to be
[1:56:55] courageous he put himself in the battle
[1:56:57] he never just
[1:56:58] understand there and say oh i have given
[1:57:00] you the land go and take it go and take
[1:57:02] care of it no no no no no
[1:57:04] and that is the same thing with this
[1:57:05] land that he have given us
[1:57:07] this promise is unto you and to your
[1:57:10] children
[1:57:10] and to as many as the lord our god shall
[1:57:13] call
[1:57:13] he never left us alone he's in the fight
[1:57:16] with us
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:19] and the way you can see him is when he
[1:57:21] has identified something in your life
[1:57:24] that you need to work on that's how god
[1:57:27] show up
[1:57:30] he marks himself behind that praise the
[1:57:33] lord
[1:57:34] so don't don't get mad with the preacher
[1:57:36] don't get mad with the holy spirit
[1:57:39] just lift your hand say thank you jesus
[1:57:42] i know you said you will never leave me
[1:57:44] you will never forsake me
[1:57:46] amen that man did not have no idea but i
[1:57:49] know you are the one sticking with me
[1:57:51] you want to rip this thing out of my
[1:57:53] life praise the lord
[1:57:55] oh i mean serving god that way it is
[1:57:57] just so sweet amen because
[1:57:59] you have the holy ghost walking with you
[1:58:01] every day
[1:58:02] he's the messenger of this hour
[1:58:06] amen he is the messenger of this hour
[1:58:10] praise the lord oh my
[1:58:13] we were just studying uh uh
[1:58:17] down the seventh week and playing
[1:58:19] through the tapes here
[1:58:21] there was something that is that was
[1:58:22] particular to daniel 7 to wheat
[1:58:26] and water was the reason why dog
[1:58:30] that gabriel came and brought the
[1:58:32] instruction to down here
[1:58:34] was all about returning the people
[1:58:37] toward their homeland
[1:58:41] amen the 70 weeks
[1:58:44] i mean just described events that were
[1:58:47] happy
[1:58:48] but the important thing of the
[1:58:51] visitation of the angel
[1:58:53] was to return the people to their
[1:58:55] homeland
[1:58:57] sometimes we get caught up in the dates
[1:59:00] we get caught up in the things that were
[1:59:02] happening the antichrist and the
[1:59:04] the marks of oman and order but the
[1:59:06] important the reason why
[1:59:09] he said gabra and now you think about it
[1:59:13] now
[1:59:13] why the king of peshawar fought against
[1:59:16] that visit
[1:59:21] because it was about returning the
[1:59:23] people toward their homeland
[1:59:25] and one thing the devil don't want you
[1:59:27] to get back to is to your homeland
[1:59:30] he want to have you as a stranger
[1:59:32] rumbling about
[1:59:34] never identify your inheritance never
[1:59:37] identify
[1:59:37] never come to rest because the promise
[1:59:41] of the homeland
[1:59:42] was to bring the people to rest
[1:59:46] i mean he can get you work up like a
[1:59:48] church member
[1:59:49] on the road seven days a week to church
[1:59:51] as long as
[1:59:53] you are not having rest
[1:59:56] you are not at a place of rest in your
[1:59:59] walk with god
[2:00:01] praise the lord he can just walk you out
[2:00:03] from one church to another church
[2:00:05] from one belief to another billy from
[2:00:06] one thing to you just walk up and then
[2:00:09] you i mean all over the place one thing
[2:00:12] he don't want to bring the people to
[2:00:16] when gabriel was bringing that message
[2:00:19] to daniel it was all the major
[2:00:23] principle fame of that message
[2:00:26] was the return to the homeland
[2:00:32] praise the lord their return
[2:00:35] to the homeland
[2:00:40] scholars can argue they can say whatever
[2:00:43] they want to say
[2:00:44] but israel is in their homeland
[2:00:50] praise the lord israel is in their
[2:00:52] homeland
[2:00:56] and see how god will do it
[2:01:00] how god will do it we know the
[2:01:04] mysterious end
[2:01:08] of the wall wall amen
[2:01:11] we know the mysterious end how he ended
[2:01:15] general i'll be
[2:01:18] and his name was mistaken to the arabs
[2:01:22] as allah
[2:01:26] so when he heard that the allah was
[2:01:28] coming to surrender
[2:01:32] it was a mysterious end
[2:01:36] praise the lord now you think about it
[2:01:38] in a local history
[2:01:40] just in that same period of time
[2:01:44] when israel was declared as
[2:01:48] an independent lane
[2:01:51] a hitler and messily and all these
[2:01:54] people started rising
[2:01:57] amen carrying jews to the gas chamber
[2:02:01] persecuting jews
[2:02:02] why was that happening because now the
[2:02:05] homeland was
[2:02:06] liberated god wanted them to go back
[2:02:08] home
[2:02:09] [Music]
[2:02:13] so now he's creating a pressure
[2:02:17] and that is the same promise to the
[2:02:19] church the same way
[2:02:21] political pressure led israel back to
[2:02:24] her homeland
[2:02:25] spiritual pressure is going to put this
[2:02:27] bra on her two feet
[2:02:31] spiritual pressure praise the lord
[2:02:34] amen when you realize that uh all
[2:02:38] doctrines has failed amen you realize
[2:02:41] that church
[2:02:41] is just a gathering place for us to
[2:02:43] encourage ourselves
[2:02:45] is not really the absolute the absolute
[2:02:47] is jesus christ
[2:02:48] the absolute is the word of god this
[2:02:51] word of god
[2:02:52] coming from out of the pages of the
[2:02:53] bible becoming personal to you
[2:03:02] praise the lord
[2:03:05] we have tried to build big churches
[2:03:09] but we just realized that we have have a
[2:03:12] lot of crows makes with the eagles
[2:03:17] praise the lord and many men are
[2:03:19] scripting unaware like the apostle will
[2:03:21] say
[2:03:24] to spy out our liberty
[2:03:30] so the mission is not a it's not a it's
[2:03:32] not a big church
[2:03:34] the mission is the word of god becoming
[2:03:37] personal to you
[2:03:38] the word on two feet
[2:03:42] [Music]
[2:03:49] political pressure drew israel back to
[2:03:53] their homeland
[2:03:55] spiritual pressure when you when you
[2:03:58] start seeing dryness everywhere
[2:04:02] amen it used to be where people
[2:04:05] used to hover on a church atmosphere you
[2:04:08] come to the church they play the music
[2:04:10] we dance we praise the lord
[2:04:12] oh the anointing was there
[2:04:15] it's just like wasting water on the
[2:04:17] dog's back
[2:04:23] as soon as you shake yourself it's gone
[2:04:26] you get back in the week where was the
[2:04:28] revival
[2:04:31] praise the lord
[2:04:41] and gradually we're realizing that
[2:04:43] spirit is be
[2:04:44] beginning to lift up off the earth
[2:04:49] now he that is holy will remain holy
[2:04:51] still
[2:04:52] and he that is filthy will remain
[2:04:55] filtered still
[2:04:58] praise the lord
[2:05:02] when those hours comes then it's time
[2:05:05] where you need this
[2:05:06] word to become a person
[2:05:11] the word has taken every form it's now
[2:05:14] in your cellphone it's in your our part
[2:05:16] it's in every form
[2:05:20] but the progression is to be made flesh
[2:05:28] and that's why god did in the creation
[2:05:30] he started creating things
[2:05:32] but the real achievement was to make a
[2:05:35] man
[2:05:36] in his image because god
[2:05:39] wanted to become flesh
[2:05:43] that is the progression of the word that
[2:05:46] is the aim of the gospel
[2:05:50] because this is not a story that is not
[2:05:52] a theory
[2:05:53] we are serving a living christ and one
[2:05:57] day we will ring with him we will walk
[2:05:59] with him
[2:05:59] he will be in a body form
[2:06:04] it's not a story it's not just an
[2:06:06] imagination it's not a concept to just
[2:06:09] draw
[2:06:09] people together
[2:06:15] praise the lord
[2:06:21] young people that's the reason why over
[2:06:23] and over
[2:06:25] i encourage you to stay in the word read
[2:06:28] your bible you will never
[2:06:30] understand this message if you're not
[2:06:32] reading your bible
[2:06:33] praise the lord this message has never
[2:06:36] come to take the place of the bible
[2:06:39] i will prove to you by history every cut
[2:06:43] has been successful to get the bible
[2:06:45] from the people
[2:06:48] and introduce their concept
[2:06:52] every cut has been successful
[2:06:55] so if you put this bible aside and you
[2:06:57] think you can live on the on the message
[2:07:00] on the tip in the box
[2:07:01] you have just breathed yourself into a
[2:07:10] cart
[2:07:16] the man in the arena there's a story of
[2:07:19] a little woman here
[2:07:23] oh praise the lord
[2:07:27] she was not a military woman
[2:07:35] she was a nurse
[2:07:40] praise the lord
[2:07:47] and the little story goes about this
[2:07:49] woman where
[2:07:50] where does real authority comes from
[2:07:54] in the civil war there was a chain of
[2:07:57] command
[2:07:58] for both armies and authorities flow
[2:08:00] down
[2:08:01] from above beginning from the com the
[2:08:03] commanding in chief
[2:08:05] to the general the the culinary the
[2:08:07] captains and so on
[2:08:11] but sometimes the brides didn't have
[2:08:15] as much authority as they thought they
[2:08:18] have
[2:08:20] there was a chief nurse named mary ann
[2:08:24] she was called maryland
[2:08:27] and she was known to thousands of
[2:08:29] wounded soldiers
[2:08:33] as uh mother miriam
[2:08:39] who was not respected of rank or
[2:08:42] prestige
[2:08:45] when it came to providing proper care
[2:08:49] for the ordinary soldier
[2:08:52] she frequently flood military rules and
[2:08:56] regulations
[2:08:59] she was known to offer sharp words for
[2:09:03] officers
[2:09:04] who failed to care for their men
[2:09:08] general sherman received a complaint
[2:09:11] from his staff
[2:09:12] about her about her
[2:09:15] about her in subordination
[2:09:17] [Music]
[2:09:19] and disregard for military protocol
[2:09:22] general sherman struggled and he said

[2:12:48] whether you were a general whether you
[2:12:50] were the president she gave you command
[2:12:52] when it comes to caregiving
[2:12:57] when the person needed to be taken care
[2:12:59] of she tell you you

[2:13:14] bled
[2:13:15] to to death to the kuhalar on this on on
[2:13:19] the stretcher

[2:13:23] paper before they take him for treatment
[2:13:25] he will have just laid it and die
[2:13:29] but when she stepped into the camp
[2:13:32] she took the situation under control

[2:13:44] power

[2:13:56] power
[2:13:59] so am i waiting for special ministry to
[2:14:02] be able to help a falling brother
[2:14:05] to be able to encourage a sinner on the
[2:14:07] street you don't need permission from me
[2:14:10] i don't have it to give it to you
[2:14:19] what are you what are we doing with
[2:14:20] people dying around us
[2:14:22] young people on drugs
[2:14:26] young women roaming into prostitution
[2:14:28] what are you doing
[2:14:32] are you waiting for the vision
[2:14:36] or the strange spirit to come running
[2:14:38] down your spine
[2:14:45] this was a little woman
[2:14:49] all she has was she was a nurse
[2:14:54] and with what she heard and what she
[2:14:55] knows she will not stay there
[2:14:58] and allowed men
[2:15:02] and young men to lose their lives
[2:15:11] oh god gave us some miriams today
[2:15:18] praise the lord
[2:15:21] it's the man that is in the arena we all
[2:15:24] can say his best
[2:15:26] if i was the one this is what i would do
[2:15:28] and that's not what i would do
[2:15:29] we can say it best and use the right
[2:15:33] proper grammar and then look for the
[2:15:34] verb and advert and make everything
[2:15:36] sound nice
[2:15:40] but the credit goes to the man or the
[2:15:42] woman that is
[2:15:43] in the heat a young woman trying to
[2:15:46] stand for god with all she knows
[2:15:51] living for god
[2:15:55] how many times we come around and
[2:15:57] encourage
[2:15:59] instead of criticizing
[2:16:05] praise the lord you don't know what our
[2:16:07] person is dealing with in their spirit
[2:16:10] in their mind the floss of touch that is
[2:16:13] coming to them
[2:16:16] with everything they see that other
[2:16:18] teenagers are doing
[2:16:21] and the only thing that they can hotel
[2:16:25] is because there is something
[2:16:27] supernaturally
[2:16:28] holding them
[2:16:32] something supernaturally holding them
[2:16:36] that would not allow them to take
[2:16:40] a cigarette between their finger or will
[2:16:43] not allow them to defy themselves
[2:16:46] what is holding them they don't even
[2:16:48] know because they have the desire to do
[2:16:50] it they just want to do it
[2:16:53] but something supernaturally
[2:16:56] is holding them it's not you being tough
[2:17:00] you go for the modifier you not off
[2:17:06] it's not you being tough
[2:17:12] if you are tough carry your toughness on
[2:17:13] your knees
[2:17:15] that's where toughness is seen it's on
[2:17:18] the knees
[2:17:20] when you wake up with your pain stored
[2:17:22] because you were crying on your knees
[2:17:23] crying to god
[2:17:25] that's toughness amen
[2:17:35] the man in the arena
[2:17:39] praise the lord amen
[2:17:45] one day was our lord jesus we can talk
[2:17:49] about different
[2:17:50] bible character david one time got
[2:17:53] caught in the arena not even
[2:17:55] not known to himself he was not looking
[2:17:58] for the name
[2:17:59] he was just only caring for his brothers
[2:18:03] he took food for them to eat
[2:18:07] and he got caught into the arena goliath
[2:18:10] standing on the field
[2:18:11] and all the ahmed of israel hiding
[2:18:14] himself
[2:18:15] away
[2:18:18] he was the man in the arena
[2:18:22] he says who is this uncircumcised
[2:18:26] it takes a lot of courage it takes
[2:18:29] conviction
[2:18:30] he has experienced god delivering
[2:18:34] bear a lion in his presence
[2:18:38] he had an experience with god
[2:18:41] he was not looking for a brother brandon
[2:18:43] saying 1965
[2:18:47] and let me go to the table
[2:18:52] he was in he was in action
[2:18:56] who is this uncircumcised philistine
[2:19:01] to tarnish the name of almighty god you
[2:19:04] know what he did he put
[2:19:06] god in the challenge he said god is your
[2:19:08] name
[2:19:09] it's your name that is at stake
[2:19:13] and that's the reason why we fail all
[2:19:15] the time because we are looking for the
[2:19:16] name
[2:19:19] we want people to know our name
[2:19:23] if you put god's name to the state god
[2:19:26] will defend his name
[2:19:28] and that's what david doe that's what he
[2:19:31] did
[2:19:33] defy the name of the almighty god
[2:19:37] he was the man in the arena oh saul said
[2:19:40] you are a little boy
[2:19:41] they criticize him his brother said this
[2:19:44] boy is too
[2:19:44] nutty get him away from here but he was
[2:19:48] the man that had the birthday
[2:19:51] he was the man that had the burden
[2:19:55] and if he was going to cost his life he
[2:19:57] was ready to give his life
[2:19:59] i'd rather die than to see the name of
[2:20:02] god
[2:20:02] be blasphemed amen
[2:20:07] glory be to god
[2:20:12] one time he was our lord jesus he was
[2:20:15] the man
[2:20:16] god himself in flesh
[2:20:20] was the man in the arena praise the lord
[2:20:24] when he healed the sake and raised the
[2:20:26] dead to all praise him
[2:20:30] but when he started to identify himself
[2:20:32] with scripture
[2:20:35] they said he hired devil on him
[2:20:39] praise the lord but he was the man in
[2:20:42] the arena
[2:20:43] he had to stand alone
[2:20:46] even when all his disciples denied
[2:20:50] and rejected him
[2:20:54] because he was prophesied he would be
[2:20:56] rejected
[2:20:58] he had to stand alone he was a man
[2:21:02] in the arena when three cross
[2:21:06] were on cavalry golgotha
[2:21:10] he was the man in the arena even in his
[2:21:14] death
[2:21:15] he was still giving life tomorrow you'll
[2:21:18] be with me
[2:21:19] in paradise even in death
[2:21:25] he was still giving life yes
[2:21:30] glory be to god
[2:21:34] praise the lord
[2:21:39] and when he resurrected on the day of
[2:21:42] pentecost he poured his spirit back on
[2:21:44] the church
[2:21:46] you know what he was what he was looking
[2:21:48] for he was looking for tight teams
[2:21:53] he said this time i'm not going alone i
[2:21:55] need tight teams
[2:21:57] he tap your hand and say go in and fight
[2:21:59] if you can't make it come back and give
[2:22:00] me the tap i will get into the battle
[2:22:04] that's why he poured his spirit to be
[2:22:07] able to get a tight team
[2:22:10] and he redeemed every one of us for us
[2:22:12] to get in the fight
[2:22:14] praise the lord
[2:22:17] and some just enjoy staying on the
[2:22:19] touchline
[2:22:21] when it's supposed to be in the ring
[2:22:23] they get on the touch line and their
[2:22:25] voice is loud
[2:22:28] he didn't hit him not knocking
[2:22:41] he's looking at you and looking at me
[2:22:46] to be the one in the arena in this age
[2:22:49] praise the lord
[2:22:52] he's expecting you and me to be the one
[2:22:55] in the arena
[2:22:57] in this age
[2:23:01] fighting out devils yes
[2:23:04] doing all we can to be a life of example
[2:23:12] not looking at people on the street and
[2:23:13] criticizing them
[2:23:18] amen
[2:23:27] if you can just meet one
[2:23:30] and just say god bless you if you don't
[2:23:33] have
[2:23:34] nothing to say
[2:23:37] just say god bless you musicians you can
[2:23:41] come
[2:23:44] i realize if i get in my notes will not
[2:23:46] leave from here today
[2:23:48] praise the lord
[2:23:52] hallelujah
[2:23:55] he's looking at me and you
[2:24:00] to be the one in the arena
[2:24:06] we get so scared we don't want to fail
[2:24:11] and because we don't want to fail we
[2:24:13] start ascribing to people's
[2:24:15] ideas what this person think and what
[2:24:18] this other person think
[2:24:20] and pretty soon we don't we don't have
[2:24:23] no
[2:24:23] conviction of ourself
[2:24:27] we want to please this person we want to
[2:24:29] please that person
[2:24:33] it's all because we're struggling in
[2:24:39] [Music]
[2:24:40] ourselves
[2:24:42] praise the lord
[2:24:46] but you see like the apostle paul says
[2:24:49] he said we are more than conquerors
[2:24:53] [Music]
[2:24:55] being more than conquerors means that
[2:24:58] [Music]
[2:25:01] a victory has been attributed
[2:25:05] a victory has been imputed unto us
[2:25:09] jesus imputed his victory unto us you
[2:25:12] don't need nothing more than that
[2:25:15] you don't need nothing more than jesus
[2:25:19] victory
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:22] you don't need no oppression or victory
[2:25:24] for any person or glory
[2:25:27] because all he's going to do is just
[2:25:28] going to stick prayer right at the back
[2:25:30] of your neck
[2:25:34] he has already imputed victory to us
[2:25:40] so whether in defeat
[2:25:44] or in victory we are victorious
[2:25:48] praise the lord
[2:25:53] but you see that's that is that little
[2:25:55] thing
[2:25:56] that makes people to stick and sin and
[2:25:58] stick in wrong
[2:26:03] because we are we are afraid to be
[2:26:05] looked at as a failure
[2:26:10] to say oh i tried to witness to this
[2:26:11] person it never came to the lord
[2:26:13] maybe i need to go study my bible more
[2:26:15] no all you need to do is just fall in
[2:26:17] love with jesus
[2:26:18] love him all the time whenever you tried
[2:26:22] and you feel
[2:26:23] loving more
[2:26:24] [Music]
[2:26:31] that's the problem with the church
[2:26:34] that's the problem with the last this
[2:26:36] church
[2:26:37] failure has killed the church
[2:26:41] because it looks like we are not winning
[2:26:43] souls people are not
[2:26:44] people are not living holy so let's
[2:26:46] bring rock and roll
[2:26:48] [Music]
[2:26:49] they allow the people to live anyhow or
[2:26:51] as they will stop coming to church
[2:26:53] because the church is filling the best
[2:26:56] way they can keep the people
[2:26:57] is to turn them loose to the arms of the
[2:27:00] devil
[2:27:17] it's not the critics that count
[2:27:21] now the man i point out how the strong
[2:27:24] man stumble
[2:27:26] we can talk about this brother fall we
[2:27:27] can talk about this one leave the
[2:27:29] message
[2:27:30] i said jesus keep me near the cross
[2:27:34] keep me near the cross lord
[2:27:36] [Music]
[2:27:40] oh we're the daughter of these who have
[2:27:43] done better
[2:27:44] the credit belongs to the man who is
[2:27:46] actually in the arena
[2:27:50] who faced a mild who faces mild with
[2:27:53] dust and sweat
[2:27:55] and blood
[2:27:58] remember brother bam talking about that
[2:28:00] soldier that came from the battlefield
[2:28:02] wounded
[2:28:05] [Music]
[2:28:06] and the general president was looking
[2:28:08] for somebody to ride in his chair
[2:28:10] with him when he saw that wounded sawyer
[2:28:14] he says this is the man
[2:28:15] this is the man that fought for me to
[2:28:18] have this liberty
[2:28:20] come on in the chair let's ride together
[2:28:28] do we want to go on flowery bags of ease
[2:28:34] we always have somebody to blame
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:39] if it's not a church it's the pastor
[2:28:40] he's not a pastor my wife is not my wife
[2:28:43] my husband
[2:28:44] or my children you all will have
[2:28:45] somebody to blame get in the fight
