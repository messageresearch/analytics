[50:14] Christ we humbly pray
[50:17] amen and
[50:19] amen turn with me tonight to the Book of
[50:22] Ecclesiastes chapter
[50:24] 12 and I want to read one one verse
[50:27] before you have your
[50:30] seats this is the books one of the books
[50:33] of Solomon and Solomon was a wise man
[50:37] and went through all kind of learning
[50:40] and exploration and all those things but
[50:44] he comes down to the end of this book
[50:46] and he says in verse
[50:48] 13 let us hear the conclusion of the
[50:51] whole
[50:52] matter fear God and keep his
[50:57] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[51:01] of man amen may the Lord add His
[51:04] blessings to the reading of the word
[51:06] tonight as you have your seats we've
[51:09] already prayed so we just ask God to
[51:12] bless the reading of the word and you
[51:15] might think this evening brother Joe
[51:18] that's a very small scripture but it's
[51:22] not the size of the scripture it's the
[51:25] content amen that's what we want to look
[51:28] for this
[51:29] evening as we said Solomon was a very
[51:33] wise man he had much learning and he did
[51:37] a lot of acquiring knowledge and so
[51:40] forth but at the end of it all he came
[51:43] down to this conclusion or to this
[51:46] thought the whole matter the conclusion
[51:48] of it is that we fear God keep his
[51:51] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[51:55] of man amen and I I believe tonight that
[52:00] that statement is still very true it's
[52:03] our duty Amen to keep God's Commandments
[52:07] to fear Him amen and to put our
[52:10] confidence and our trust in him amen how
[52:14] many kids do I have Under 12 here
[52:19] tonight don't be
[52:22] bashful just one two three four
[52:28] five
[52:30] six okay now I said I'm just a simple
[52:33] man
[52:35] now I believe that we are a people of
[52:39] Faith amen
[52:42] right don't be afraid to say
[52:46] Amen so I'm the one that's got the
[52:49] Jitters
[52:54] amen so I like I like to give examples I
[52:58] like to do things that the kids won't
[53:01] forget now I've
[53:04] been ridiculed for doing this a certain
[53:07] way so I'm not going to do it that way
[53:08] tonight I'm going to do it this way now
[53:12] I want you to understand I have in my
[53:15] possession a $20
[53:18] bill United States Greenback
[53:22] currency and tonight I'm going to give
[53:25] this $20 bill to
[53:28] somebody who brother
[53:30] Joe one of these kids under
[53:33] 12 amen I have to be careful because
[53:35] brother Eric knows where I'm going he
[53:37] might come and get it but it's for the
[53:39] kids under
[53:40] 12 okay it's right here you can see
[53:44] it until your faith catches the
[53:48] Revelation I'm going to give it to
[53:50] somebody I'm not a
[53:52] liar I'm going to do what I
[53:55] said amen now put your faith in action
[53:58] tonight
[54:00] okay is this
[54:02] okay amen praise the
[54:05] Lord now we we know the conclusion of
[54:09] the whole matter that's to fear God Amen
[54:12] to keep his Commandments that's that's
[54:15] everything that God looks at us to do
[54:18] amen God when he spoke his word and said
[54:22] let there be what did he do he simply
[54:25] believed his word amen he he spoke it
[54:29] and he believed what he spoke tonight
[54:32] amen and we find that God does not
[54:35] require anything more of you and I but
[54:38] to believe his word amen now uh keep in
[54:45] mind faith is the substance of things
[54:50] hoped for it's the evidence of Things
[54:55] Not Seen that's right amen now as we go
[54:59] through tonight let your faith rise and
[55:02] when your faith Rises to a point you'll
[55:04] understand what I'm doing I'm going to
[55:06] give the $20 bill away tonight you may
[55:09] hear me say that a couple of times till
[55:10] somebody catches the
[55:14] Revelation
[55:15] now tonight we want to deal for just a
[55:19] little bit with conditions now I don't
[55:22] care who you are tonight it doesn't
[55:25] matter I should say who you are what
[55:27] your background is how rich you are how
[55:30] poor you are amen it doesn't matter we
[55:33] all deal with conditions amen I deal
[55:38] with a condition that I need glasses I
[55:41] deal with a condition I need some help
[55:43] hearing amen and especially certain
[55:46] tones and certain levels of of voice I
[55:49] need I have the condition amen but I
[55:52] believe what the word of God says that
[55:54] by his stripes I am healed amen so uh as
[56:00] we look tonight no matter how long
[56:03] you've lived with your conditions amen
[56:06] no matter how how many times it's it's
[56:10] it's affected your life or hindered your
[56:14] your walk or anything like that it
[56:17] doesn't matter it is just a
[56:20] condition amen it is just something that
[56:24] is as def uh the definition in Webster
[56:27] he would say a mode of being or a form
[56:30] of existence of a person or a thing a
[56:34] state at a particular time that's right
[56:38] Amen in other words it is a condition
[56:41] I'm standing here tonight amen in this
[56:44] little church here in uh whatever little
[56:48] town this is Outskirts of Minneapolis St
[56:52] Paul amen that is a condition but Lord
[56:55] willing tomorrow afternoon amen we're
[56:57] going to go to the airport and we're
[56:59] going to get on a plane and we will no
[57:01] longer more be in this condition now
[57:05] again I'm I'm simple preacher so simple
[57:08] illustrations amen now another
[57:12] definition is the state of something
[57:15] with regard to its appearance its
[57:19] quality or its working order now I have
[57:23] it home a 1931 model Ford that was my
[57:27] dad's that was left to me amen and for
[57:31] the last couple of years I've been busy
[57:33] and in the work of the Lord and the
[57:35] church and then different things and
[57:37] that a model or Model A is in not the
[57:41] best
[57:43] condition in other words I've I've
[57:45] neglected it and and and not got it
[57:48] cleaned up in fact I've got the
[57:50] carburetor off I had it rebuilt I hadn't
[57:52] got it put back on yet amen it is in a
[57:55] condition but God willing Amen in the
[57:57] very near future I'm going to change the
[58:00] condition of that car amen and and and
[58:04] the conclusion of that amen is I have a
[58:07] beautiful 1931 Model A coupe amen that
[58:11] that I enjoy in memory of my daddy amen
[58:15] so I've got to get it in a different
[58:17] condition so that that condition that it
[58:20] is in will not be the conclusion that's
[58:25] right I hope you're following where I'm
[58:27] going tonight
[58:29] amen now what we need to understand as
[58:32] Christians is that whatever condition
[58:35] you may have God has a remedy
[58:39] for amen for it's not what you have but
[58:44] it's what he can deliver you from amen
[58:48] it's what what mountain he can move out
[58:51] of your way amen we we look at things
[58:54] you know as a human being
[58:56] amen as just a $20 bill laying on the
[58:58] podium here amen as a mountain in front
[59:02] of your window to see a beautiful view
[59:04] amen as uh you know one time man looked
[59:07] at the skies and said oh I wish we could
[59:09] be up there like the birds amen that was
[59:11] a condition but it wasn't the
[59:14] conclusion amen I I hope you're
[59:17] following me amen so we realize tonight
[59:20] amen that through technology and
[59:22] knowledge amen man has changed that
[59:26] condition and they're no longer amen a a
[59:29] conclusion that they can't fly amen but
[59:33] as as the prophet Saul amen when Israel
[59:36] was brought back home they were brought
[59:38] back home On Eagle's Wings amen and we
[59:42] realized that was the jet planes that
[59:44] carried them home amen so whatever
[59:46] condition you're in or situation you
[59:49] face it didn't take God by
[59:52] surprise I know you all are familiar
[59:55] with sister Destiny and the family there
[59:58] in in Georgia and we have a connection
[1:00:00] because our Our Song Leader's wife is
[1:00:03] brother Daniel's niece so we have a
[1:00:05] connection there and we we know about
[1:00:07] that and we're so sorry so sadden to
[1:00:10] hear that but anyways H you know as as
[1:00:13] as we think of that amen the hardship
[1:00:16] and the the the the detriment of of
[1:00:19] spirit if you will and the Heartbreak
[1:00:22] amen that is just the condition that
[1:00:24] they're in and I'm not trying to be
[1:00:27] littl it or anything like that I
[1:00:28] certainly feel for that family amen but
[1:00:31] what what we've got to understand that
[1:00:33] is a condition right now amen that
[1:00:37] that's not the conclusion the conclusion
[1:00:40] is she was a saint of God she was a
[1:00:43] sister born again of the Holy Spirit and
[1:00:46] one day amen she will rise for the
[1:00:49] resurrection amen we'll meet them in the
[1:00:52] air that's the conclusion tonight
[1:00:56] amen now that's what we're looking for
[1:00:59] this evening amen
[1:01:02] now Romans 8:28 29 and and we quoted it
[1:01:06] I I believe for whom he did for know he
[1:01:09] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:01:13] the image of his son that he might be
[1:01:16] the firstborn among many Brethren
[1:01:19] moreover whom he did
[1:01:21] predestinate amen them he also called
[1:01:25] amen and whom he called them he also
[1:01:30] Justified amen and whom he justified
[1:01:34] them he also
[1:01:37] glorified amen so let's look at where we
[1:01:40] are tonight amen we have been
[1:01:43] predestinated by
[1:01:45] God Amen we've been predestinated for
[1:01:48] this hour amen handpicked by God Amen
[1:01:53] then it goes on Amen uh uh for whom he
[1:01:56] did predestinate them he
[1:02:00] called amen how many can say I've been
[1:02:03] called amen and whom he called amen them
[1:02:08] he also
[1:02:09] Justified so you sat here tonight as a
[1:02:12] son and daughter of God Amen no matter
[1:02:16] what what kind of life you came from
[1:02:19] what kind of sin you have committed if
[1:02:21] you put it underneath the blood of Jesus
[1:02:23] Christ you sit here
[1:02:26] Justified amen more Pure White than this
[1:02:29] handkerchief is tonight because the
[1:02:31] blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you
[1:02:34] from all
[1:02:37] sin not
[1:02:39] 2third not a part but the blood of Jesus
[1:02:43] Christ has cleansed you from all sin
[1:02:47] amen so whom he has Justified if you've
[1:02:52] been Justified it's just as if you never
[1:02:55] never did it in the first
[1:03:00] place
[1:03:03] wow just as if you never did it in the
[1:03:07] first place there's no
[1:03:09] Footprints there's no thumbprint left to
[1:03:12] identify you as having done that deed
[1:03:16] amen you you it cannot be restored and
[1:03:20] brought against you again because the
[1:03:22] blood of Jesus Christ as brother renam
[1:03:25] taught us amen the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:27] is the
[1:03:29] bleach amen you sisters know what bleach
[1:03:32] is amen and you drop that sin in the
[1:03:35] blood bleach of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:03:38] when that drop of ink goes into that tub
[1:03:40] of bleach as brother Bram described it
[1:03:43] amen what does it do that bleach breaks
[1:03:46] it down so much that it can never be
[1:03:49] found again amen so your sin that's
[1:03:53] under the blood of Jesus Christ amen has
[1:03:56] been annihilated tonight it can no
[1:04:00] longer be called up in a court of law
[1:04:02] against you this evening God himself
[1:04:05] cannot find it because it's in the sea
[1:04:08] of his
[1:04:11] forgetfulness
[1:04:15] amen but we're not done yet those who he
[1:04:18] has Justified he has also
[1:04:22] glorified so I'm sitting here standing
[1:04:25] here tonight looking at a group of
[1:04:28] saints of God that have already been
[1:04:32] glorified amen just as if you never did
[1:04:34] it in the first place glorified by the
[1:04:38] word of God this evening and what God
[1:04:40] has declared that he has done for the
[1:04:43] True
[1:04:45] Believer amen thank you
[1:04:49] Jesus well brother Joel how can you how
[1:04:53] can you say that well let's just take an
[1:04:55] example

[1:05:18] amen but brother Tom went and he's
[1:05:22] speaking to brother Billy Paul and he
[1:05:24] said brother Billy said sister Marilyn

[1:20:51] beginning Isaiah 41:26
[1:20:55] who hath declared from the beginning
[1:20:57] that we may know and a four time that we
[1:21:01] may say he is righteous yay there is
[1:21:05] none that showeth there is none that
[1:21:09] declareth yay there is none that heareth
[1:21:12] your words
[1:21:15] amen it's him that has declared the end
[1:21:19] from the beginning it's God that knew
[1:21:23] that here on September the 21st amen
[1:21:27] that I would be standing here preaching
[1:21:29] this little simple message to you
[1:21:31] tonight I didn't know it amen but God
[1:21:36] God laid things in
[1:21:38] order brought Brother Juan and I

[1:21:55] visit us amen and I just felt in my
[1:21:58] heart that's what I need to do amen but
[1:22:01] uh you know back under I didn't know
[1:22:06] that but what I didn't know back then

[1:22:09] conclusion amen all right Isaiah 48
[1:22:14] and3 I have declared the former things
[1:22:17] from the beginning and they went forth
[1:22:20] out of my mouth and I showed them I did
[1:22:23] them suddenly and they came to pass
[1:22:26] don't you realize tonight that God in
[1:22:28] his word said I will have a
[1:22:31] bride God in his word said I have called
[1:22:35] a people for my name sake God in his
[1:22:39] word has declared amen there's going to
[1:22:41] be a city and there's going to be a
[1:22:43] people live in that City amen is
[1:22:46] declared there's going to be a bride
[1:22:48] amen that's called by his name
[1:22:51] sake now we we go down to the country of
[1:22:55] Jamaica brother Thomas Brady that

[1:23:26] Brady calls her to sing brother one he
[1:23:28] doesn't call her sister rexan he calls
[1:23:30] her sister
[1:23:35] Joe she is identified with me she is a
[1:23:40] part of me we've been married 46 years

[1:23:46] of each other amen and and I don't look
[1:23:49] that old I
[1:23:53] know but we she she is a part of me so
[1:23:56] instead of calling her by her name he
[1:23:58] calls her by my name and don't you
[1:24:01] realize tonight that's who we are we are
[1:24:04] Mrs Jesus Christ tonight the queen of
[1:24:08] glory

[1:24:29] with me but I don't I have a picture in
[1:24:32] my file somewhere at
[1:24:34] home
[1:24:36] of you look at it this way and it looks
[1:24:39] like a an
[1:24:40] old lady with bumps on her nose and you
[1:24:45] know bump on her chin and just a lot of
[1:24:48] wrinkles and just really looks just worn
[1:24:51] out
[1:24:55] that is her
[1:24:56] condition but you take that piece of
[1:25:00] paper you look at that it this way okay
[1:25:04] let me turn it around so you can see the
[1:25:06] same thing I'm seeing okay then you take
[1:25:09] that picture and you turn it right over
[1:25:11] and there is a beautiful young princess
[1:25:15] same picture it's just the way it's
[1:25:17] looked that oh don't you realize you may
[1:25:20] look at yourself as a failure you may
[1:25:23] look at yourself like faults and
[1:25:24] failures and heartaches and troubles but
[1:25:27] I tell you tonight Thou Art all fair my
[1:25:30] love there is no spot in thee amen
[1:25:33] that's how God looks at us tonight amen
[1:25:36] because here this is not our
[1:25:40] conclusion this is our condition we're
[1:25:44] in this Earthly Tabernacle to be to be
[1:25:47] uh challenged and tested and tried and
[1:25:50] proven amen whether we can believe God
[1:25:52] or not amen
[1:25:58] right it's too early to go to
[1:26:02] sleep
[1:26:04] amen
[1:26:06] amen praise the Lord all right first
[1:26:10] Peter 2 and 24 who his own self bear our
[1:26:14] sins in his own body on the tree that we
[1:26:18] being dead to sins should live unto
[1:26:22] righteousness by whose stripes you were
[1:26:25] healed amen so that sickness that you've
[1:26:28] carried amen that Affliction that you've
[1:26:31] dealt with I want you to understand
[1:26:33] tonight by his stripes you were
[1:26:35] healed amen and those stripes were there
[1:26:39] in the mind of God before the foundation
[1:26:42] of the world so let me tell you tonight
[1:26:44] God's not looking at you as you see you
[1:26:47] tonight he's looking at you as his word
[1:26:50] has declared that you are this evening

[1:27:09] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:27:13] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:27:18] healed so your condition is not your
[1:27:22] conclusion your condition is only a set
[1:27:26] state of of being at a given
[1:27:30] time amen that's right now this young
[1:27:33] brother over here he's sit sitting

[1:40:54] this message to
[1:40:56] us the miles he traveled the scars that
[1:41:00] he had on his
[1:41:02] Spirit of friends that stabbed him in

[1:41:25] him through this hardship and and the
[1:41:27] misery of losing a loved one and and and
[1:41:30] I'll get him so discouraged that he'll
[1:41:32] quit but they didn't

[1:41:58] God wouldn't let
[1:41:59] him hanging on the power pole working on
[1:42:03] the lines took hold of it and the next
[1:42:06] thing he found himself on the ground
[1:42:08] took the pistol and tried to to to shoot
[1:42:10] himself but it it wouldn't
[1:42:13] fire because God had a purpose don't you

[1:42:46] despair

[1:44:04] Africa came and he preached our meeting
[1:44:06] one year he said his mind is full of us

[1:44:27] Jesus two
[1:44:29] scriptures that show us clearly that God
[1:44:32] knows what he's doing when he chose you

[1:44:36] test Isaiah 547 no weapon that is formed
[1:44:42] against thee shall
[1:44:45] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[1:44:48] against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[1:44:51] condemn
[1:44:53] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[1:44:55] the Lord and their righteousness is of
[1:44:58] me saith the Lord let me tell you a
[1:45:02] little
[1:45:03] story I shared with brother one today
[1:45:07] how my dad
[1:45:08] was he was in the meetings in Spindale
[1:45:11] North Carolina brother Bram preached
[1:45:13] there and then dad's Pastor brother
[1:45:17] pardon that brought brother brandham to
[1:45:18] Spindale told my dad later said I had a
[1:45:21] interview with brother Bram
[1:45:23] and he told me my Ministry was to go and
[1:45:26] come to the mission fields of the world
[1:45:28] he said I failed to do it amen he went
[1:45:31] into business and he got so busy with
[1:45:33] five different businesses that he never
[1:45:35] made one trip so in the meantime dad
[1:45:38] moved
[1:45:39] away and then 1961 or so uh the Lord
[1:45:45] spoke to that he just he he wasn't tired
[1:45:48] of serving the lord he wasn't tired of
[1:45:50] preaching but he just felt like there
[1:45:52] was something more so he called a fast
[1:45:55] and solemn assembly for three days a
[1:45:57] Friday Saturday and Sunday and on Sunday
[1:46:00] morning the Lord he was pastoring the
[1:46:02] church two 300 people mission trips just
[1:46:06] just radio broadcast just really doing
[1:46:08] well amen and and that Sunday
[1:46:12] morning fasting and seeking God God
[1:46:14] spoke to him said leave here and go to
[1:46:17] Ruth that's where our church is Ruth
[1:46:19] North Carolina a one red light Town God
[1:46:22] said leave here and go to Ruth and build
[1:46:24] a church in my name for the common
[1:46:25] people that was Sunday morning Dad come
[1:46:28] to the pull pit that morning told the
[1:46:30] people the Lord has spoken to me told me
[1:46:33] to leave here are you talking about
[1:46:36] faith a wife and five children no
[1:46:39] promise of any support no promise of
[1:46:42] anything except God's word leave and go
[1:46:46] to Ruth and build a church so he
[1:46:49] resigned that morning left there came to
[1:46:52] RSE
[1:46:53] amen and started working to get a church
[1:46:56] built and established amen and and you
[1:47:00] know he he finally got it and and got
[1:47:02] things going and in in an old junk pile
[1:47:06] brush pile they had to clean it all up
[1:47:07] before they started building but
[1:47:10] God clearly had a plan and a purpose
[1:47:14] amen and then by God's grace As Time
[1:47:18] progressed amen he caught the vision for
[1:47:21] the Mission Outreach teach and m mission
[1:47:24] work and was already doing mission trips
[1:47:27] and so forth but it just grew in his
[1:47:30] life and his understanding and and uh
[1:47:33] from that time 1973 when this meeting
[1:47:37] started and we've been having the
[1:47:39] meetings every year since then over 50
[1:47:42] years 51 years that we've been doing

[1:48:07] those years and and I'm not saying that
[1:48:10] in any bragging way I'm just sharing
[1:48:11] with you amen that that you know his
[1:48:15] discomfort in that situation amen it was
[1:48:18] hard he he he he didn't want to quit

[1:48:22] pastoring or preaching he just felt like
[1:48:24] there was something else amen and God
[1:48:27] let him get in that condition amen so
[1:48:29] that he could come and speak to him Amen

[1:49:27] private land owners in the town of Ruth

[1:49:33] began to bless him and God began to open
[1:49:36] doors and make a way amen and again I'm
[1:49:39] not bragging I'm just testifying of
[1:49:41] God's grace that your condition is not

[1:57:33] interview so she said come on it's a
[1:57:35] certain time so I went interviewed for
[1:57:38] the job they hired me on the spot no
[1:57:41] questions asked just told me what it was
[1:57:43] and what they paid and so forth so I
[1:57:45] went to work as a janitor working 12 14
[1:57:48] hours a week for the one amen and then
[1:57:51] after a little while
[1:57:52] there was two gentlemen two pharmacists
[1:57:55] that owned the business the one
[1:57:57] pharmacist was older he's single never
[1:57:59] married he he retired from a merchant
[1:58:01] marines and never married the other was
[1:58:04] a married man had a couple of boys and
[1:58:05] so forth but
[1:58:07] anyways uh it got to the point to where
[1:58:11] I needed more time and more hours and I
[1:58:14] was about to quit because I was already
[1:58:16] working uh you know in in another
[1:58:18] business as well uh by that time and
[1:58:21] when the Old Gentleman Mr Henry as we
[1:58:24] called him when he got win that I was
[1:58:26] going to leave he he talked to his
[1:58:28] partner he said we need to create a
[1:58:31] position for
[1:58:32] Joe now listen starting as a janitor
[1:58:37] amen and and within a year a year and a
[1:58:41] half time I moved from the janitor to
[1:58:44] the
[1:58:46] bookkeeper had no training no formal
[1:58:49] education and bookkeeping but I went
[1:58:51] from the senitor to the bookkeeper and
[1:58:54] then after almost 23 years when I left
[1:58:57] the business to go full-time pastoring
[1:59:00] in the ministry amen I was the CFO of
[1:59:03] the company not just one company but two
[1:59:05] companies because we split the pharmacy
[1:59:07] into a walk-in Pharmacy and then a a a
[1:59:11] Home Health Pharmacy dealing with
[1:59:13] nursing homes and so forth and man we
[1:59:15] split it so I was CFO of both
[1:59:18] companies making a decent salary
[1:59:21] insurance pay
[1:59:22] amen they they took good care of me the
[1:59:25] Old Gentleman Mr Henry when I get ready
[1:59:27] to go to Jamaica or Guyana or wherever
[1:59:30] uh he would tell me of his Merchant
[1:59:32] Marine days traveling here and there and
[1:59:34] going to this place and the places we
[1:59:35] were going said now you need to go here
[1:59:37] while you're there and all that that's
[1:59:39] beside the point but let me get to the
[1:59:40] point amen and I would be in my office
[1:59:43] working getting ahead with the paperwork
[1:59:46] and so forth amen and he'd come through
[1:59:48] the office at at night and evening
[1:59:49] nobody else there but me and him and he
[1:59:52] would he would say so you leaving
[1:59:53] tomorrow on your trip I said yes sir he
[1:59:56] said well that's good said how long
[1:59:57] you'll be gone and I tell him amen and
[2:00:00] uh next thing I know he'd stick some
[2:00:02] money in my hand and say here we don't
[2:00:03] want you to get
[2:00:04] stranded an old Methodist man amen but
[2:00:09] he it was God that's all I can say it
[2:00:13] was just God that that blessed him and
[2:00:16] blessed me in that company almost 23
[2:00:19] years I worked there not only did I work
[2:00:21] there my wife worked there three of my
[2:00:22] sisters worked there brother Dan worked
[2:00:24] there uh some nephews worked there some
[2:00:27] some cousins work there amen so what if
[2:00:30] I arrang this for you what if God let
[2:00:34] you go through that trial just to put
[2:00:36] you in a position to where he could
[2:00:38] bless
[2:00:43] you see God let you come to church
[2:00:45] tonight Under
[2:00:47] 12 so that you could be blessed but you
[2:00:50] just got to trust him
[2:00:54] and in this case you got to trust
[2:00:57] me I'm God's representative
[2:01:00] tonight
[2:01:02] amen so far I have no
[2:01:05] takers
[2:01:15] amen listen your circumstance your
[2:01:18] condition was
[2:01:20] formed amen but it all worked for your
[2:01:25] good understand you have to know that
[2:01:28] this condition is for the glory of God
[2:01:33] Amen my brother Joe how can that be amen
[2:01:36] look look look at my life my testimony
[2:01:39] that I just shared with you it was for
[2:01:41] the glory of God Amen because God
[2:01:45] allowed me to get jobless to let the
[2:01:48] company that I was working for they had
[2:01:51] they had voted in the union the people
[2:01:53] did and the company said that there was
[2:01:55] a squabbling courts about one vote and
[2:01:58] the the company said if the union gets
[2:02:00] it will will'll close down and move to
[2:02:02] another uh uh to to another state and uh
[2:02:07] so that's what happened that's what they
[2:02:08] did and I was without a job along with
[2:02:11] about 400 other people amen but it was
[2:02:14] all so that God could get me into a
[2:02:17] position that he could bless
[2:02:19] me the job shutting down that was a
[2:02:23] condition but the conclusion was that I
[2:02:26] was allowed to go into a janitorial
[2:02:30] position listen I had a key for the
[2:02:33] business from the day I started till the
[2:02:35] day I left and the boss man when I had
[2:02:37] my exit interview and told him I was
[2:02:39] resigning and the first thing he said
[2:02:41] was don't go now that's not me CU again
[2:02:45] I have no training no education I just
[2:02:48] learned as I went amen but God had a
[2:02:51] position he he had a a reason to put me
[2:02:53] there amen and we we'd bring people in
[2:02:57] you know the missionaries in and we'
[2:02:59] we'd bring them in introduce them to the
[2:03:01] to the owners that we work for we just
[2:03:03] had a a good family kind of
[2:03:05] relationship and uh you know I bring
[2:03:08] them in and and then the the Old
[2:03:10] Gentleman after they'd leave we'd have
[2:03:13] conversation how do you know these
[2:03:15] people from Ghana and Guyana and and uh
[2:03:20] you know the Mexico and and how do you
[2:03:24] know all these people without a
[2:03:26] denomination that was his words without
[2:03:29] having a denomination how how are you
[2:03:31] connected with all these people I tried
[2:03:34] my best to explain to them it's through
[2:03:35] the word of God through the leadership
[2:03:38] of the Holy Ghost that has brought us
[2:03:40] together through a message for the end
[2:03:44] time
[2:03:49] amen and I I I'll just i' like to tell
[2:03:52] you I preached his funeral in a
[2:03:53] Methodist
[2:03:54] church
[2:03:56] amen that's that's God that's God 2
[2:04:00] Corinthians 12:9 and he said unto me
[2:04:02] Paul his condition oh my his condition
[2:04:07] stressed him
[2:04:08] out he dealt with it constantly it gave
[2:04:12] him hardships trouble in life but the
[2:04:16] conclusion of that was that God had him
[2:04:20] in a position to where where you and I
[2:04:23] can enjoy the writings of his testimony
[2:04:27] and his experience and the revelations
[2:04:29] that God gave him
[2:04:33] amen oh
[2:04:36] my Paul talking like even in his
[2:04:39] condition his infirmities he had Grace
[2:04:42] God speaking to him that give him the
[2:04:44] ability to stand and count it all
[2:04:48] joy
[2:04:50] amen oh
[2:04:54] how long am I supposed to
[2:04:57] preach amen maybe I'll finish it in the
[2:05:00] morning stand with me tonight would

[2:05:19] revelation

[2:05:45] waiting
[2:05:47] amen sorry it was there all the time
[2:05:54] it it's been there all the
[2:05:56] time it's our
[2:05:59] faith it's our faith brother that has to
[2:06:02] take hold of what he has

[2:06:08] that he
[2:06:09] is and that he is a
[2:06:12] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[2:06:15] him you have to make an effort to ask
[2:06:19] him Lord It's Your word it's your

[2:06:25] life let it increase my bank account you

[2:06:38] friend train them
[2:06:41] right amen would you bow your hearts
[2:06:44] with me this morning this
[2:06:46] evening Lord Jesus
[2:06:52] through the Simplicity of your word
[2:06:54] tonight
[2:06:55] Lord I pray father that something has
[2:06:59] been inspired to the hearts of your
[2:07:04] children Lord
[2:07:06] Jesus I don't know their circumstances I
[2:07:09] don't know their
[2:07:11] conditions but God you said that the
[2:07:14] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[2:07:18] of the Lord yes and Lord if you allow
[2:07:22] Satan to bring a
[2:07:24] condition God it's just to show us that
[2:07:27] your word is true and that your promises
[2:07:31] are
[2:07:32] real and some may say well Lord if I if
[2:07:37] I go to my grave with this condition
[2:07:40] that doesn't nullify your word that
[2:07:42] doesn't nullify your
[2:07:44] promise oh God it's still real
[2:07:48] tonight God I pray that the simple
[2:07:51] thoughts would Lodge in the hearts of
[2:07:54] your
[2:07:55] children and
[2:07:58] Lord God as the scripture said the
[2:08:01] writer he spoke and he said Lord I
[2:08:05] believe but help thou my
[2:08:09] unbelief I I I know Lord in my little
[2:08:12] illustration the kids maybe weren't too
[2:08:15] sure God they they couldn't maybe
[2:08:18] somehow believe that brother Joe would
[2:08:21] actually do
[2:08:23] that but Lord how I've seen how that
[2:08:27] that little illustration makes a very
[2:08:30] real
[2:08:31] point and a very
[2:08:35] real demonstration of how Lord we are to
[2:08:40] trust you and we are to take you at your
[2:08:42] word and believe your promises that they
[2:08:46] are
[2:08:46] true and and amen let it be so
[2:08:52] God I I I pray tonight
[2:08:54] Lord God if there's one here with a
[2:08:59] condition God that that that you will
[2:09:02] let them see it's just a condition it's
[2:09:06] not the
[2:09:08] conclusion because you said by your
[2:09:11] stripes we are
[2:09:14] healed and God you
[2:09:17] said that with every Temptation every
[2:09:20] trial every test
[2:09:22] you would make a way of Escape you've
[2:09:24] already made a way of Escape make it
[2:09:27] real to our hearts tonight Lord let us
[2:09:30] lean upon your promises this evening
[2:09:33] Lord and claim the victory Lord we we we
[2:09:36] may not see it we may not be able to put
[2:09:39] our hands around it but let us God
[2:09:43] confess the promises of your word oh God
[2:09:47] grant it tonight Lord let us take you
[2:09:50] Lord that what you said believe it
[2:09:53] tonight Lord and be the benefactors the
[2:09:57] recipients of the promises of the word
[2:09:59] of God grant it tonight Lord Jesus we
[2:10:03] commit the service into your hands
[2:10:06] now maybe as we bring this prayer to a
[2:10:10] close you've got a condition in your
[2:10:13] life and you'd just like to lift it
[2:10:15] before the
[2:10:17] Lord lift your hand and say Lord you
[2:10:20] know my condition Lord you allowed it to
[2:10:23] come you you you created the
[2:10:26] circumstances or allowed the enemy to to
[2:10:29] create and not create but Lord twist
[2:10:31] things and turn things and cause me to
[2:10:34] come into this Valley but
[2:10:37] God even in this Valley Lord there is a
[2:10:41] way out and this condition lord it's not
[2:10:45] the conclusion because your word has
[2:10:49] declared victory tonight

[2:15:20] situation and go right out of the
[2:15:23] door the way they
[2:15:26] came that was just a simple way and it's
[2:15:29] a challenge to every one of us as
[2:15:33] parents you have to we we have to teach
[2:15:36] our
[2:15:37] children it must not only be uh uh that
[2:15:40] that was just an
[2:15:43] illustration but if a child is having a
[2:15:46] headache or the child is saying I'm not
[2:15:47] feeling well tell them when you go to
[2:15:50] church go let the pastor pray for
