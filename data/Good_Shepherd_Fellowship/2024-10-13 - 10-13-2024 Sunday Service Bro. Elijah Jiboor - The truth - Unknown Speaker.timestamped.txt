[49:18] know our God does not tease his children
[49:20] with
[49:21] salvation when God has given you life he
[49:24] has given you life and um just be rest

[1:06:20] heard which we have seen with our
[1:06:24] eyes which we have looked upon and our
[1:06:27] hands have handled the word of
[1:06:31] life for the life were manifested and we
[1:06:35] have seen it and bear
[1:06:37] Witnesses and show unto you that eternal

[1:07:18] Darkness at all if we say that we have
[1:07:21] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[1:07:25] we lie and do not the truth but if we
[1:07:28] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:07:31] we have Fellowship one with another and
[1:07:34] the blood of Jesus Christ C his son
[1:07:36] cleanses us from our sin and if we say
[1:07:40] we have no sin we deceive ourself and
[1:07:42] the truth is not in us but if we confess
[1:07:45] our sins he is sful and just to forgive

[1:08:31] light and in him is not Darkness at all
[1:08:35] and if we say we have fellowship with
[1:08:37] one another and walk in darkness we lie
[1:08:41] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[1:08:44] the light as he is in the light we have
[1:08:47] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:08:50] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:08:54] us from all
[1:08:56] sin Hallelujah so know that God is light
[1:08:59] and in him there's no Darkness so you
[1:09:02] cannot have Fellowship Hallelujah to
[1:09:04] have Fellowship we know how to have
[1:09:06] fellowship with the light and if God is
[1:09:08] a light and we walk in darkness it means
[1:09:11] we have no fellowship with him
[1:09:13] Hallelujah and that great light we saw
[1:09:16] that even said in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:09:18] chapter 1 verse4 Bible say he came in a
[1:09:22] wild wind and out of the North a great
[1:09:24] cloud a fire unfolding himself and a
[1:09:28] brightness was about it and out of the
[1:09:31] midst thereof was a c of im a light
[1:09:35] Hallelujah so see say in the midst of
[1:09:38] fire god is an IM IM call a great light
[1:09:42] hallelujah amen so you see Ezekiel saw
[1:09:45] him in the light that in the beginning
[1:09:49] Genesis he said let there be light and
[1:09:52] we going to a city in a city where the
[1:09:55] light is a light Hallelujah because he
[1:09:58] is that great light and that light there
[1:10:01] is no darkness in that light hallelujah
[1:10:03] amen and if you are walking Darkness it
[1:10:06] means you cannot have fellowship with
[1:10:08] that
[1:10:09] light Hallelujah and that what John said
[1:10:13] J from the beginning him that we have
[1:10:15] heard which we have heard we have declar
[1:10:17] unto you Hallelujah and we see John
[1:10:20] speaking in the Bible which is a p of
[1:10:23] love when you get in the person of that
[1:10:25] great light he recognize that light
[1:10:28] Hallelujah that is God himself because
[1:10:31] God is from the beginning Hallelujah and
[1:10:34] now if you look in the word of God so we
[1:10:36] seeing that in the scriptures when John
[1:10:38] saying when you're
[1:10:40] ownmost at the pmos vision he had the
[1:10:43] experience of that great light
[1:10:45] Hallelujah and that light is different
[1:10:48] from the cosmal light is different from
[1:10:51] what the electric light is different
[1:10:53] from the sunlight that light is an
[1:10:56] internal
[1:10:57] light Hallelujah and in him is love and
[1:11:01] God is light and light bring
[1:11:05] Fellowship Hallelujah Light Fellowship
[1:11:08] with light and darkness fellowship with
[1:11:12] Darkness Hallelujah you see it
[1:11:15] Hallelujah the two things are opposite
[1:11:16] one another and now no man are seen God
[1:11:20] at any time no man can see God at any
[1:11:24] time they say only the begning had
[1:11:26] declared him Hallelujah nobody has seen
[1:11:29] God because God is a spirit and they
[1:11:33] that worship him she Worship in spirit
[1:11:35] and in truth so the only begotten that
[1:11:38] came from that light had declared him
[1:11:41] hallelujah oh yes sir so you see so God
[1:11:44] is light and in him there is no darkness
[1:11:46] and notice there is nothing in in the
[1:11:50] space and when when God from the
[1:11:52] beginning there was nothing existing
[1:11:55] Hallelujah from the beginning there was
[1:11:57] there was nothing existing there was
[1:11:59] only a great supernatural being from the
[1:12:02] beginning that great Jehovah who cover
[1:12:05] all space when was speaking on the the C
[1:12:09] on the the the genes divice he said from
[1:12:12] the beginning God there were nothing
[1:12:14] existing but only that great being that
[1:12:17] were existing that cover all space and
[1:12:20] cover all times he was Everlasting to
[1:12:23] Everlasting and here the beginning of
[1:12:26] the creation Hallelujah and that is God
[1:12:29] and nothing was existing Hallelujah but
[1:12:32] he was still existing he was there
[1:12:34] Hallelujah yet he was God and God be
[1:12:38] existing Hallelujah because he is what
[1:12:40] the either Elohim which means self
[1:12:43] existing
[1:12:45] one hallelujah amen and the pr God said
[1:12:50] and after this while he said sit on the
[1:12:52] B of God he said that great secret light
[1:12:56] begin to form that Hollow now when God
[1:13:00] Hallelujah in his mind because in
[1:13:03] Genesis God created the Heaven and Earth
[1:13:06] period the Bible never tell the time
[1:13:09] that God and what create everything say
[1:13:11] God created the Heaven and Earth period
[1:13:14] but only tell us the time he begin to
[1:13:17] use the
[1:13:18] Earth Hallelujah but when Genesis one in
[1:13:21] the beginning God created heaven and
[1:13:23] earth what is milon years St years he
[1:13:26] never tell anything he said God created
[1:13:29] a heaven and earth period but with the
[1:13:32] first he say let there be
[1:13:34] light because God is light Hallelujah
[1:13:38] then now God begin to what to
[1:13:41] form begin to form create the sun to
[1:13:44] create the moon Hallelujah the banic
[1:13:46] light but from the beginning God was a
[1:13:49] self-existent
[1:13:51] one
[1:13:52] hallelujah amen so you see a church so
[1:13:56] you know that that God that great light
[1:13:59] that God is Elohim which me the the
[1:14:02] self-existing one then out of that
[1:14:04] supernatural being Hallelujah came a
[1:14:07] little light a h of light and the light
[1:14:11] is called the logos and the logos is the
[1:14:14] anointing and out of the logos come the
[1:14:17] son then he spoke let there be light
[1:14:20] that is why we know in St John 1 verse1
[1:14:23] the Bible said in the beginning was the
[1:14:25] word and the word of God and the Word
[1:14:28] was God hallelujah and the word will
[1:14:30] make men and the word dwelt among us
[1:14:32] hallelujah so you can see that son came
[1:14:34] from that light that we know Jesus is
[1:14:37] the light of what the
[1:14:40] word hallelujah oh yes sir he came from
[1:14:43] that light amen because man in his mind
[1:14:47] don't know how God is but God for men
[1:14:51] for men to get the idea of who that God
[1:14:54] is
[1:14:55] which is self-existent one he had to
[1:14:58] condescend from that light and took a
[1:15:01] body and stepped onto it then we going
[1:15:03] to see him to know get the idea of who
[1:15:06] that God is why he say I come from God
[1:15:09] I'll go back to God I come from that
[1:15:12] light I'll go back to that light that is
[1:15:15] why on the road of
[1:15:16] Damascus when Paul persecute the
[1:15:19] Christian and Paul knew who he was
[1:15:22] Hallelujah who Paul made when Paul saw
[1:15:25] that great light Hallelujah and the
[1:15:28] light could blind Paul eyes and Paul
[1:15:30] spoke to that light who are thou Lord
[1:15:33] but the voice from that light say I'm
[1:15:36] Jesus Paul got to know that Jehovah of
[1:15:39] the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the
[1:15:42] New Testament he is that great
[1:15:47] light
[1:15:49] hallelujah oh yes sir amen so God to
[1:15:53] develop and came from that light
[1:15:55] then come the logos then come the son
[1:15:59] hallelujah what Jesus said he said Jesus
[1:16:03] say in the book of St John 17
[1:16:05] verse5 what he said he said now oh
[1:16:09] Father glorify th me he said glorify
[1:16:14] thou me with thy own self with the glory
[1:16:19] which I had with thee before the war
[1:16:22] wars
[1:16:25] because he come from there to be made
[1:16:28] manifested Hallelujah that is a mystress
[1:16:31] that people don't understand that what
[1:16:33] the Bible said and what without control
[1:16:36] verses great is the mystery of godliness
[1:16:40] God the self-existent one was manifested
[1:16:43] in the flesh God become flesh hallelujah
[1:16:48] amen and God is the word that was in the
[1:16:51] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:16:53] of God so the word is light that's why
[1:16:56] the gospel is a
[1:17:00] light hallelujah oh yes sir he said the
[1:17:04] glory that how the before the world was
[1:17:07] he said and I was manifest I manifest
[1:17:10] that name unto men so what is the name
[1:17:14] of God he said I have manifest your name
[1:17:18] manifest manifestation means to make
[1:17:22] no Hallelujah so you manifesting God to
[1:17:27] us for which for us to recognize that
[1:17:30] great light that way he said I have
[1:17:33] manifested th name unto the men which
[1:17:38] thou given me out of the word that they
[1:17:42] were and thou G me gave down me and they
[1:17:47] have kept the
[1:17:49] word he said now they have know that all
[1:17:52] things whatsoever that has given me are
[1:17:56] there he said I have gave unto them the
[1:17:59] word which thou GTH
[1:18:02] me Hallelujah and God is his word and
[1:18:07] his word is a
[1:18:09] light that he say I gave them unto the
[1:18:12] that word because he was the word he was
[1:18:16] the
[1:18:17] light
[1:18:19] hallelujah amen he said I gave you unto
[1:18:23] them the word which th G me and that
[1:18:26] they receive them and have no Sur I come
[1:18:30] out from thee that Genesis he came out
[1:18:34] of that
[1:18:35] light so we can have the idea of who
[1:18:39] that God
[1:18:41] is I come out of thee Hallelujah that's
[1:18:45] a manifestation that many people don't
[1:18:48] Son of God Son of God means god in
[1:18:52] flesh God be made manifested in our mess
[1:18:56] and the gospel is God himself and he is
[1:18:59] that great light that came to be
[1:19:01] manifested unto
[1:19:04] us hallelujah and a gospel is a light
[1:19:08] that shine in in our heart Hallelujah
[1:19:11] that why he say I come out of thee that
[1:19:14] that they have believed that thou do
[1:19:15] send me and I pray for them I pray not
[1:19:19] for the word but for them which thou has
[1:19:21] given me for they are done
[1:19:26] so church is a sign that you cannot come
[1:19:29] except God call you that you cannot see
[1:19:32] that light until God call you because
[1:19:34] the Bible say Darkness upon the Earth
[1:19:37] Andross Darkness upon the people but
[1:19:40] arise and
[1:19:41] Sh for the light has come Hallelujah the
[1:19:45] light is a gospel because Darkness on
[1:19:48] the earth gr Darkness upon the people
[1:19:51] hallelujah but there a light in the end
[1:19:53] time and at the even time Earth shall be
[1:19:58] light and we are in the evening time and
[1:20:01] will be there a home going Hallelujah so
[1:20:04] why are you standing Hallelujah he said
[1:20:07] Hallelujah in the beginning was the word
[1:20:10] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:20:13] was and the Word was made flesh and
[1:20:15] dwelt Among Us God unold himself down to
[1:20:20] human being hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:20:24] that great logos that H light come out
[1:20:28] of him he come out of that H light the
[1:20:30] son the logos be made manifested that
[1:20:33] Supernatural God hallelujah oh yes
[1:20:37] church now when God came when he came
[1:20:41] out of that light when he stepped down
[1:20:43] then he spoke the word let there be
[1:20:48] light the how you to create the
[1:20:52] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:20:54] the what was going what was going what
[1:20:56] made flesh he said without him nothing
[1:20:59] was made all things was made by him and
[1:21:03] for
[1:21:05] him Hallelujah so when he step out of
[1:21:08] that light that's what Paul was
[1:21:11] persecuting a Christian because he
[1:21:13] couldn't understand how can they say
[1:21:15] because you know Jehovah God is a God
[1:21:17] who was serving but how can they say
[1:21:19] Jesus was
[1:21:21] God but Paul when Paul the revelation on
[1:21:24] the road
[1:21:26] Damascus the emper recognize that
[1:21:28] Jehovah god of the Old Testament is
[1:21:31] Jesus Christ of the New
[1:21:35] Testament
[1:21:37] Hallelujah but take it take a light to
[1:21:40] open your eyes it take a light for you
[1:21:43] to see it it take a light for God to to
[1:21:47] speak to you hallelujah or else your
[1:21:50] your eyes will be open but you are
[1:21:53] blind you'll be seen but you are
[1:21:56] blind Hallelujah because it's God
[1:21:59] manifest himself to us hallelujah so now
[1:22:03] when God begin to create the word you
[1:22:05] are writing what a fresh Bible in a
[1:22:09] zodak Hallelujah start with a virgin
[1:22:12] birth and end with the Le the lion L of
[1:22:16] Christ start with a first coming of
[1:22:18] Christ and ending with the second coming
[1:22:20] of Christ hallelujah hallelujah and God
[1:22:23] to write everything begin to show the
[1:22:24] whole world Hallelujah when he begin to
[1:22:26] form this
[1:22:28] Earth Hallelujah but when he create men
[1:22:31] men begin a less of God and God gave man
[1:22:35] domain over everything Authority and
[1:22:38] power but the enemy has slip in but God
[1:22:42] have internal purpose and God's purpose
[1:22:45] in our life can never be
[1:22:49] defeated
[1:22:50] hallelujah oh yes sir so you see Church
[1:22:55] and we are made out of light because God
[1:22:58] is a light we all that is sitting here
[1:23:01] we are made out of light we are made out
[1:23:04] of the cosmo light hallelujah amen that
[1:23:08] is why when you when when you take Ezra
[1:23:12] EZ don't have light but it's a light
[1:23:15] from your body that make the
[1:23:17] Ezra Hallelujah yes sir it's a light
[1:23:21] from your body that make the E and the
[1:23:23] prayer God t that hallelujah amen and
[1:23:27] say we are born with full RS of
[1:23:31] light he said at 25 years one R go out
[1:23:37] at 35 years another R go out I fed why
[1:23:42] see what me then found on the last R
[1:23:46] Hallelujah as we pass 65 we are living
[1:23:49] on a lastar bre of light that is in our
[1:23:53] body that is a reason you why why he say
[1:23:56] and that's what you know that the Ezra
[1:23:58] when you taking Ezra is a light that
[1:24:00] keep coming out of your
[1:24:02] body now you don't take that frequently
[1:24:05] that Hallelujah because a light that
[1:24:07] your light from your body that produce
[1:24:10] e Hallelujah he said that's a cosmo
[1:24:14] light that is in you that you are made
[1:24:16] out of you are full of light light
[1:24:20] cells there are cells in your body that
[1:24:23] are full of light
[1:24:25] Hallelujah but God is a Different Light
[1:24:29] hallelujah oh yes sir yet is a light and
[1:24:33] now take note a proof that is why God
[1:24:36] come with s the the H picture the pill
[1:24:39] of fire that came down now God is always
[1:24:42] manifested in
[1:24:44] light
[1:24:46] hallelujah amen and and God light he
[1:24:50] operated through that light of God
[1:24:52] operate through the cosmo light
[1:24:56] Hallelujah to shine us so it's God light
[1:25:00] operate through the cosmal light to
[1:25:02] lighten
[1:25:05] us and now Church to know actually who
[1:25:09] that light is to catch a revelation that
[1:25:13] what God Said in Romans 10
[1:25:16] verse3 he said for whatsoever for
[1:25:20] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:25:23] the Lord shall be be saved it said but
[1:25:26] how shall they call on him in whom they
[1:25:30] have not
[1:25:33] believed and how shall they believe in
[1:25:35] him of whom they have not
[1:25:38] heard and how shall they heard without a
[1:25:43] preacher so God always you me to the age
[1:25:47] to declare who God is and that is why
[1:25:51] John said in what first John H
[1:25:54] Hallelujah this is the witness
[1:25:56] Hallelujah and he was saying the in
[1:25:59] first John and this is the
[1:26:02] message that we heard from him from the
[1:26:05] beginning and I declare unto
[1:26:09] you that God is light Hallelujah so it
[1:26:14] take a preacher to declare Hallelujah he
[1:26:18] said for who Lord shall be saved but how
[1:26:22] can they call in home the have not
[1:26:26] believed how can you call to God if you
[1:26:29] don't know actually who that God
[1:26:31] is how can you come to him how can you
[1:26:34] approach him you can read the Bible
[1:26:37] Hallelujah because anyone educated can
[1:26:40] turn a picture of the scriptures but it
[1:26:43] take God to open our eyes of
[1:26:45] understanding that is why that ethopian
[1:26:47] Enoch that were driving out he are read
[1:26:50] aah he couldn't understand but the Holy
[1:26:53] Ghost how to take Philip to say why you
[1:26:57] really understand that he said how can
[1:26:59] they hear how can they believe I a
[1:27:02] preacher speaking to them and our God
[1:27:05] using men hallelujah oh yes sir to speak
[1:27:08] this word to
[1:27:10] you
[1:27:12] Hallelujah and he said how shall they
[1:27:15] call on him in whom they have not
[1:27:17] believed how shall they believe in him
[1:27:20] in whom they have not heard and how
[1:27:22] shall they heard without a preacher
[1:27:24] he said what and how shall they preach
[1:27:28] except they be
[1:27:31] S so unless God sends you then God back
[1:27:34] the ministry if God send you man will
[1:27:37] take it of you but when God send you God
[1:27:40] take care of you Hallelujah so God will
[1:27:42] s a preacher that will come without
[1:27:48] compromising Hallelujah that will preach
[1:27:51] the power of God to the people and and
[1:27:54] tell them Hallelujah that this is a
[1:27:56] light that this is the way walk ye in
[1:28:02] it hallelujah oh yes sir it said how can
[1:28:07] it preach except to be S for it is
[1:28:09] written how beautiful are the feet of
[1:28:12] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:28:15] bring good THS of good things Isaiah
[1:28:20] said Lord he said what Who Shall Believe
[1:28:22] our report now say how can believe
[1:28:26] report unto whom the arm of God is
[1:28:28] reveiled you cannot believe this report
[1:28:31] until God open your eyes of
[1:28:36] understanding because you should know
[1:28:38] God for
[1:28:39] yourself if you know God for yourself in
[1:28:42] the power of the resurrection and if you
[1:28:44] accept that light then you not allow
[1:28:46] Darkness to enter your life you don't do
[1:28:49] things contrary to the Gospel of Jesus
[1:28:52] Christ Hallelujah
[1:28:54] because if you receive that light it has
[1:28:57] to shant to you to others and your life
[1:29:00] to be an example to
[1:29:05] others
[1:29:06] hallelujah oh yes sir so fake I'm by
[1:29:10] hearing and hearing by the
[1:29:13] word say God to open your eyes that what
[1:29:17] the gospel like I will sing this song in
[1:29:19] the light the Gospel Light Let It Shine
[1:29:23] from sure to sure

[1:29:28] always used
[1:29:30] men from
[1:29:32] Genesis men become the instrument that
[1:29:35] God been using men we saw in Israel when
[1:29:39] he were in on a bondage in Egypt God S A
[1:29:43] deliverer he had to send Moses
[1:29:46] Hallelujah to care the word of God but
[1:29:48] when God Called Moses when God sent a
[1:29:51] man God don't say behind Hallelujah so
[1:29:54] when God Called Moses when Moses met the
[1:29:57] burning bush it was a light he met that
[1:30:00] light the Bush on consumption and God in
[1:30:02] the light is in a fire Hallelujah and M
[1:30:06] recognized but God said go to St let my
[1:30:10] people go and when MOS are going that
[1:30:12] light step into

[1:30:21] going but God always work you men
[1:30:25] true human being hallelujah oh yes sir
[1:30:29] the prayer of God say he send an angel
[1:30:31] and speak the and and speak to the voice
[1:30:34] of a man he said God always use men for
[1:30:38] his
[1:30:39] work he doesn't use
