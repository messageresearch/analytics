[0:19] [music]
[1:10] [music] this and I wrote jotted
[1:12] something down in there when brother
[1:14] God's um gifts are always fi God's gifts
[1:20] always find their place God's gifts is
[1:23] always rejected but it really finds its
[1:26] place when now watch the gift that these
[1:30] wise men bought are brought to him.
[1:32] Today we find that we're swapping gifts.
[1:36] Everybody has to get a gift and try to
[1:38] figure out what the next fella is going
[1:40] to give him so he can give him something
[1:41] comparing that much. And if it isn't on
[1:44] New Year's, he feels he has to make it
[1:46] up. And each one studying worrying,
[1:48] walking the floor, the millionaires, how
[1:50] they're going to get by to give so much
[1:53] to this one and that when it's it's all
[1:56] together wrong.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's all together. Christmas,
[2:00] here's his only one gift that you can
[2:02] give and that is yourself.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God because God's
[2:09] already gi to you his gift. Amen.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Now, there's only one thing you owe back
[2:14] to God. That's yourself to him.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; Now, and many times names
[2:21] uh in the Bible, we don't notice it no
[2:24] more today. We uh you've often heard me
[2:27] scorn this name of children calling or
[2:30] people calling their children Ricky.
[2:32] Now, Ricky is a horrible name. See, and
[2:35] it's you mustn't uh call him that. If
[2:38] you got a child named Ricky, for
[2:40] goodness sakes, change it something
[2:41] else. Uh Ricky or or Elvis or something
[2:44] like that, Ricky means a rat.
[2:48] See, and so you you and and what you
[2:50] call a person that impresses that. Uh a
[2:53] little lady the other day had a little
[2:54] boy out there called Ricky and his
[2:57] name's uh Ricky, James Ricky. And
[3:00] because it was so Hopper Ricky, they
[3:02] called him Ricky. I said, "Change that
[3:03] name." I know some people sitting right
[3:06] here now got a little grandson and his
[3:09] uh name is uh the one one little boy is
[3:12] a sweetest pleasantest little fell and
[3:14] the other is Ricky and that's what he
[3:16] is. You just watch him. His nature is
[3:18] just like that and he I said to some of
[3:21] his grandparents or somewhere I said
[3:23] tell the mother change the name of that
[3:25] boy. Just change that name over and
[3:26] watch what happens to the kid. See if
[3:29] people don't want to believe that. We
[3:30] think we've lived too long for that. If
[3:32] there isn't something in a name, then
[3:35] why as long as Jacob was called Jacob,
[3:38] which means suppler, deceiver, that's
[3:40] what he was. But when he wrestled with
[3:42] the Lord all night, and the Lord changed
[3:44] his name and about when he's about 60
[3:46] years old, he changed his name from from
[3:49] uh from Jacob to Israel, a prince before
[3:54] God. And that's what he was.
[3:57] Why was Abram called had to be called
[4:00] Abraham
[4:02] before the baby could be born? Why is
[4:04] Sarah called Sarah before the baby could
[4:08] be born? Why was Paul or call his name
[4:12] was Saul? But when he met Jesus, he
[4:14] changed him from Saul to Paul. when
[4:17] Simon was changed from Simon to Peter
[4:20] which means little stone and uh all
[4:24] their names were changed is because what
[4:26] you are called is something about it.
[4:30] When you speak something it identifies
[4:33] itself. I don't want to get in there cuz
[4:35] that's coming up next Sunday night. See
[4:37] identification of a word. And um but now
[4:40] we find these things so true. Now watch
[4:44] God. What a strange thing it is tonight
[4:47] to see that those man magis learned man
[4:51] great man coming down from the east that
[4:54] was Babylon which is India and they
[4:57] never come in any uh all night started
[5:00] one night got there the next it was
[5:02] about two years getting there they never
[5:04] come to a little baby in a manger they
[5:05] come to a young child young child and
[5:08] Herod killed the children from two years
[5:10] old u uh see to know that it wasn't a
[5:12] little infant laying in a cradle he just
[5:14] killed all infants, but he killed the
[5:16] young children so he'd be sure to get
[5:18] him. Anywhere from two years old back.
[5:21] He set the time up because knowing he
[5:22] didn't want to kill too many, all of
[5:24] them. He because they were more like
[5:26] slaves to him. He wanted to get be sure
[5:28] to get so he said the kid be about 2
[5:30] years old. So everything from 2 years
[5:32] old down kill it. See, and that brought
[5:35] to pass what the prophet said. as in and
[5:38] Rama there. They heard a a screaming or
[5:41] crying, a weeping that racial weeping
[5:44] for her children and they were not. Now
[5:47] did you notice that these wise men great
[5:51] man was up in Babin and they saw his
[5:54] star. We said we have saw his star in
[5:58] the east and are come to worship him.
[6:00] They come from the east where they saw
[6:02] the star going west because India is
[6:06] west northwest of ba of of Palestine and
[6:10] they come right down through the Tigers
[6:13] River and crossed over the plains right
[6:14] on and come down into Bethlehem where
[6:18] they found the the the baby. Remember
[6:21] Joseph and them never left there. They
[6:22] went right down to Nazareth brought the
[6:24] child up right there. Now
[6:27] we uh see here that they presented these
[6:31] men being astronomers and studying the
[6:33] stars and seen these mysterious heavenly
[6:36] lights appear up there that there was
[6:39] something going on that they know that
[6:42] this Messiah, the the ruler of heavens
[6:45] and earth was to be born and they come
[6:50] knowing that deity would be enclosed and
[6:54] housed.
[6:55] in a a human being. Paul's to show you
[6:59] their testimony. You know, you know,
[7:02] your life speaks so much louder than
[7:05] your words till no matter what you say,
[7:07] people know what you are, but what you
[7:09] are. And watch these people, these magi,
[7:14] they brought him, watch the gifts. They
[7:16] brought him identified what they thought
[7:18] he was. They brought him gold,
[7:21] frankincense, and myrrh. And now watch
[7:24] what these symbols that I want to talk
[7:26] to you about now is what these symbols
[7:30] mean. Now I've got some scripture wrote
[7:32] out here that we'll read just in a
[7:34] moment on it the Lord willing. Now gold
[7:38] and frankincense and myrr. Now gold in
[7:43] the Bible uh how fitting it fits the
[7:47] Christ because gold speaks of deity.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Gold is deity. We'll get to it just in a
[7:54] moment. Frankincense speaks of service
[7:57] and mirror is death.
[8:01] God deity in service to die.
[8:05] And that's what he was. The very thing
[8:08] that they brought identify what they
[8:12] thought he was. And I'll say that to us
[8:15] today. the things that we bring to him.
[8:20] Identify what our thoughts is about him.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean? See, if
[8:26] you're if you believe it with all your
[8:29] heart, every word of that, you will
[8:31] identify it by giving all that you have
[8:34] to it. See, but if you believe it's a
[8:36] good place to associate with better
[8:38] people around church and things like
[8:40] that, that's just about what you give.
[8:43] just a few social hours with some of the
[8:45] congregation or something. But if you if
[8:48] you really believe it with all your
[8:49] heart, then you give everything that's
[8:51] in you to see and it identifies you that
[8:55] you truly believe the message that you
[8:57] believe it to be the truth. So many
[8:59] people say, "I can believe this much. I
[9:01] can believe." So the disciples I believe
[9:03] the last time here I spoke on that
[9:05] believers make believers not
[9:06] unbelievers. Well, I did I speak on that
[9:08] here. See and each person watch their
[9:11] category. be will come to a place where
[9:13] they can take so much of it can't take
[9:15] the rest. Now, how fitting these gifts
[9:18] was to Christ journey on earth, a baby
[9:22] born here on earth and these gifts that
[9:25] the wise man brought him fitted just
[9:28] exactly his commission from God and his
[9:31] journey on earth. Now, the first thing,
[9:35] God, this was God. Jesus was God in the
[9:41] form of man. That's hard for people to
[9:44] swallow that even today.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; That he was God. And he that's what he
[9:49] was. He was nothing less than God. He
[9:52] was God manifested in place. He was the
[9:55] creator in his own creation.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; That he was a creator in his creation.
[10:03] by the creation.
[10:05] For the creation he was a creator in his
[10:09] creation, by his creation, for his
[10:12] creation all winds right back in God the
[10:15] whole thing. Don't you see?
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Fullness of God.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; He was a creator in so much that he was
[10:22] God and he was a being on earth, a being
[10:26] of time, which mean that he must had a
[10:29] beginning. Therefore, he created himself
[10:33] a body to live in.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; God himself created a body for himself.
[10:40] See, that by this creation, he might
[10:45] save the lost creation that he had
[10:48] created.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; There is nothing that man can
[10:51] annihilate. There isn't one thing. You
[10:54] can't do nothing to completely destroy
[10:57] anything.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; You might take a piece of paper and burn
[11:00] it up. You might burn a building down.
[11:02] You might burn a tree down. You didn't
[11:03] annihilate it. You That heat in there,
[11:06] that fire that breaks up. That's only
[11:09] chemicals bursting. They're turning back
[11:12] to what they was at the beginning.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; They're not annihilated. If you burn up
[11:17] a piece of wood and the world say if we
[11:20] lived in eternity like God and that
[11:23] chemicals out of that wood and that fire
[11:25] went back to its original beginnings and
[11:27] it's and whatever it was the breakings
[11:29] of the atoms and so forth, the the world
[11:32] say would stand for millions of years
[11:34] that could come right straight back
[11:36] again and be another tree just exactly
[11:38] like it was. You cannot annihilate
[11:42] anything because it is the spoken word
[11:46] of God.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, that gets me feel religious now.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; See, what God says is it forever stands.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you cannot annihilate. We are
[12:03] part of this earth and we can never be
[12:05] completely annihilated. No sir.
[12:09] The sin the soul will be annihilated. We
[12:11] realize that. But the the body that we
[12:14] live in cannot be annihilated. Amen. See
[12:18] now therefore God created himself a
[12:23] body. He was a creator and created his
[12:27] own creation that by this creation he
[12:31] might save them that were lost in his
[12:35] creation. That's you and I, creatures of
[12:38] time.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; His His word exactly showed that he and
[12:44] his works proved that he was nothing
[12:47] less than the creator.
[12:51] He took a piece of bread
[12:54] and broke it and kept breaking that one
[12:57] piece of bread and fed 5,000 people out
[13:01] of it and took up seven basketfuls of
[13:06] pieces left over.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; And everybody there had a a a complete
[13:12] filling of bread. He took a fish and
[13:17] broke that fish off. Uh we realize that
[13:20] he did create that fish in the
[13:22] beginning.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; He did create that bread in the
[13:25] beginning. But he took that fish and
[13:29] broke that fish off. A live fish had
[13:32] been and was then boiled or or fried.
[13:37] And whenever he broke it all, whatever
[13:39] it was, boiled or fried, it grow back.
[13:44] The same minute that he broke it,
[13:45] another bought a fried fish.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[13:51] &gt;&gt; That showed that he was nothing less
[13:54] than Jehovah.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was a creator
[13:59] &gt;&gt; that could take his own creation and by
[14:03] his creation express who he was.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; That's proved he was what he was.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; He was deity. So gold was becoming to
[14:14] him in the offering at his birth. He was
[14:17] deity made flesh. Am I no strangers
[14:21] among us tonight I suppose? So in this
[14:24] prayer meeting but let me say something.
[14:26] Did Jesus when he was sure now this is
[14:28] for thinking now for pro probably
[14:32] broken rather notice just for thinking
[14:36] Jesus said in St. John 14:12
[14:40] He that believeth on me, the works that
[14:43] I do shall he do also, and greater than
[14:47] this shall he do, for I go to my
[14:49] father." Did you notice that? Notice now
[14:54] that was the son of God promising to the
[14:58] believer that greater things that he did
[15:01] and these thy faith that the believer
[15:04] would do greater things than he did. St.
[15:07] John 14th chapter 12th verse. Is that
[15:10] right?
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Do you believe Jesus said it?
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Notice when Jesus created bread, he took
[15:17] a piece of bread and created bread that
[15:20] had already been bread. When he created
[15:23] fish, he took a fish that was first
[15:26] created a fish and put another fish out
[15:29] of it. Is that right?
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; He took water which potentially would
[15:32] have become wine and made wine out of
[15:34] it. Is that right? But we seem in our
[15:37] midst in this last days create things
[15:39] right out without anything standing
[15:41] there.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[15:44] &gt;&gt; That create a squirrel where there is no
[15:46] squirrel.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Oh, he's remains God.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; He's just as much deity today as he was
[15:55] then ever was or ever will be.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; He's still God and challenging hearts to
[16:01] believe it. Amen.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Greater things than this you without
[16:05] anything to hold and break off of. Speak
[16:08] it in.
[16:10] Notice now we find that he's he
[16:15] identified
[16:16] the works that he did identify that he
[16:19] was deity.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Show him that he was.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; For he said, "If I do not the works of
[16:26] my father, then don't believe me." And
[16:29] could not the Christian say today, if I
[16:31] do not the works of my Savior. Believe
[16:34] me not.
[16:36] Hey, as the Father sent me, so I you and
[16:41] if he did the works creation works of
[16:43] the father that sent him, then the
[16:46] Christ the creator that sends us does
[16:49] the works of Christ the creator.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; See, as the father sent me, so send I do
[16:56] not the works of my father believe me
[16:57] not.
[16:59] that the Christian today has got to do
[17:02] the life that Christ did
[17:04] &gt;&gt; or we have a right to say it's not. So
[17:07] notice now his works created him or
[17:11] identified him to be the creator. His
[17:14] works that he did crown his life's
[17:19] testimony that he was the creator.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; No way of getting away from it.
[17:27] Therefore, when they offered a gift of
[17:30] gold, they were perfectly in harmony
[17:32] with God,
[17:34] &gt;&gt; with their gift. They gave him gold,
[17:38] which identified him as deity. Always a
[17:41] crown, the golden crown, the golden head
[17:43] of King Nebuchadnezzy
[17:46] is represented by gold. Now,
[17:49] frankincense, we want to get these
[17:51] quickly. Frankincense is the offering of
[17:54] service to Jehovah.
[17:58] Now, if you want to put these scriptures
[17:59] down, Leviticus 2:2 and Leviticus 16
[18:03] 6-15, we find out that's the order of
[18:06] the priesthood to make an offering to
[18:09] Jehovah.
[18:11] When he made the offering, it had to be
[18:14] made and mixed with frankincense.
[18:17] For sin offerings, they took different
[18:19] things and mixed it. For the meal
[18:22] offering, for the wave offerings,
[18:24] frankincense was added because it was
[18:26] acceptable to Jehovah if it was anointed
[18:30] with frankincense, which means it is a
[18:33] service to Jehovah.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; God. And now we find out he's deity. And
[18:39] they brought him frankincense was a type
[18:42] that he was a service to Jehovah. Jesus
[18:46] is Jehovah's servant. Now in St. Matthew
[18:50] 12:15-21,
[18:52] we find out that he was Jehovah's
[18:57] servant. Behold my servant whom I'm well
[19:00] pleased. And he was I put my strength
[19:03] upon him. So his life was anointed with
[19:06] frankincense to Jehovah's servant.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; What a gift them wise men gave. See, it
[19:13] was something to the the gift that they
[19:16] give was something to identify Jesus as
[19:21] Jehovah's servant. Now, if we could only
[19:25] do that to identify our lives, the our
[19:28] lives to be identified as Jehovah's
[19:32] servant.
[19:34] That's what preconcepts was for. That
[19:36] made him Jehovah's servant. Now myra m y
[19:40] r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r
[19:40] r h was anointing of the death. We find
[19:46] in St. John the 19th chapter the 39th
[19:50] verse that going to the the funeral
[19:53] service of Jesus when Mary and them went
[19:56] they taken this ma to anoint him with
[20:00] because he must be the servant of death
[20:05] for Jehovah.
[20:07] Amen.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; See, somebody had to die. That was a
[20:12] service that had to be done for God. And
[20:15] nobody was worthy to do it but God
[20:18] himself.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:20] So bringing the mirror mirror showing
[20:24] that with the deity and with the service
[20:27] that he also was anointed with mirror
[20:30] that this deity had to be put to death
[20:35] &gt;&gt; in order to save the imperfect one. Oh
[20:39] what a great thing. The whole creation
[20:41] was lost. We just went through it in the
[20:43] seven seals. See the whole creation was
[20:46] lost. Everything was gone. It all
[20:48] belonged to Satan. He fell heir to it
[20:50] and he still owns it.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[20:52] &gt;&gt; he certainly does. That's the reason
[20:53] we're fighting, having all this trouble.
[20:55] He controls every kingdom. Satan does.
[20:58] Every government, every king, every
[21:00] kingdom controlled by Satan. The whole
[21:03] world is controlled and run by Satan.
[21:05] That's really the troubles that we have.
[21:07] Any Bible student or anything can tell
[21:10] you that Satan, well, the Bible itself
[21:12] says he did. That he controls the world.
[21:15] But Christ will fall heir to it. For now
[21:20] he is our redeemer and he come to redeem
[21:24] the whole creation and nothing could do
[21:26] it but God himself.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; That's the reason God does nothing
[21:31] outside of a man. He always works
[21:34] through a man because he had to use a
[21:35] man. A man is what he had to use to
[21:38] display his attribute of savior. He had
[21:42] to make him in his image, make him
[21:43] something like him and put him on free
[21:45] moral agency and let him act any way he
[21:47] wanted to. He could take his choice. And
[21:50] he knew that man by giving him this
[21:52] choice would fall. So being that he had
[21:55] to do that, he turns back around and
[21:57] makes a man a partner to him and does
[21:59] nothing except he does it through a man.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; The whole work of redemption come by a
[22:06] man.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; Death come by the first man.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Life came by the second Adam.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; There you are. He does nothing because
[22:18] he had to use the man for that. Then he
[22:20] uses the man to redeem back again. So
[22:23] deity become Jehovah
[22:27] or Jehovah be he is deity and he become
[22:31] a a child. He become in the form of sin
[22:34] that he might redeem the sinner.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. that he has the whole thing. Now
[22:39] look how beautiful those gifts fit into
[22:43] Jesus Christ. See gold speaking of his
[22:46] deity. Now they wasn't heathens.
[22:50] They were inspired by God. They wasn't
[22:53] imagining something. That proves right
[22:55] there even the magi that they did see
[22:58] the supernatural
[23:01] &gt;&gt; because their own gift that they offered
[23:04] identify it and spoke well of their
[23:07] testimony
[23:08] &gt;&gt; that they did see the supernatural light
[23:13] because why it speaks perfectly. They
[23:15] brought gold deity they brought
[23:18] frankincense service and they brought
[23:20] myrr for his death when he was a baby.
[23:23] Yeah.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Showing that deity would be put to
[23:27] death in the flesh.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That it might redeem fallen man.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; How can people turn that down?
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; When you realize what are we doing here?
[23:38] Where did we come from? How what
[23:40] business we got being here? We wasn't
[23:43] put here just by chance. We were put
[23:46] here for a purpose. And we must serve
[23:49] that purpose. But still, we're back on
[23:52] the basis of free moral agency where we
[23:55] can serve it or reject it just like Adam
[23:57] did in the beginning.
[24:00] Now look, these little girls here,
[24:01] brother, what a little lady play the
[24:04] piano and I was hearing them as they
[24:07] sang. We were talking about them on the
[24:09] road up here. There's a little family
[24:11] that's dedicated their whole life and
[24:13] everything to Christ. Look at that
[24:14] family, how orderly it is. Look at that
[24:17] little girl. They stand up here.
[24:19] example of young womanhood of teenage
[24:21] and no matter a few weeks ago I went out
[24:24] and like I don't know what the name of
[24:27] the place is down there in New York now
[24:29] where they just got city blocks of beat
[24:31] necks that them girls down there with
[24:33] with legots on and and uh nothing little
[24:37] bikini they caught it over the top of
[24:39] that and oh just the they do anything
[24:42] it's in their mind no matter what it is
[24:44] that's what why they're beat they can
[24:46] just do anything if they want to lay
[24:47] down don't get up, they lay down, don't
[24:49] get up. If they want to go do a certain
[24:51] thing, they do it. If they don't, they
[24:52] don't. Just their mind just traveling.
[24:55] And what does the unconverted mind come
[24:57] to? You have no right to do that because
[24:59] you're not your own. You're but a deity,
[25:02] Jesus Christ, the son of God that was
[25:04] made flesh.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; But see the conglomeration of sin and
[25:10] you see a little young girls like that
[25:12] stand out. Why to me it's light in the
[25:15] time of darkness. It's a parking lot of
[25:19] the zigzag whip of God in the skies to
[25:22] show there can be life.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; There can be righteousness
[25:26] &gt;&gt; in the midst of sin. Mary, the mother of
[25:30] Jesus in the city of Nazareth, the
[25:32] meanest city there was in the land. BUT
[25:34] OUT OF THERE, GOD chose a little lady to
[25:37] give birth to his son.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Aabadator, a womb that had to a baby had
[25:43] to be born by. And he took such a person
[25:45] to do it. God works through human beings
[25:48] to redeem human beings. He can take you
[25:52] work to you to redeem humanity. If
[25:55] you'll completely dedicate everything
[25:57] you are, if you're a young woman,
[25:59] dedicate your morals. You're a young
[26:01] man, dedicate your morals. Dedicate your
[26:04] mind, dedicate your thinking, dedicate
[26:06] your heart, dedicate your soul, dedicate
[26:08] all your
[26:19] &gt;&gt; [music]
