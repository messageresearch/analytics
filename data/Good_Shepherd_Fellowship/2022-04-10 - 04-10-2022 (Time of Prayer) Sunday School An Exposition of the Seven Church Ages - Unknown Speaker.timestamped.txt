[0:19] one world government that we are now
[0:20] setting up
[0:22] as we think of that city being the
[0:24] location of a great church council we
[0:26] see foreshadowed the ecumenical move
[0:28] taking place today wherein very soon we
[0:31] will see all the so-called christians
[0:33] come together
[0:34] indeed the church and state religion and
[0:37] politics are coming together the tares
[0:39] are being bound the wheat will soon be
[0:42] ready for the garner
[0:45] it was a city of earthquakes such
[0:47] earthquakes has finally destroyed it
[0:49] this age will end in god shaking the
[0:52] whole world that has gone off to make
[0:53] love with the old harlot
[0:56] not only will world systems crumble
[0:58] but the very earth will be shaken and
[1:00] then renovated for the millennial reign
[1:01] of christ
[1:03] the city was rich endowed by the wealthy
[1:06] it was full of culture
[1:08] science abounded
[1:10] how like today the churches are rich the
[1:13] worship is beautiful and formal but cold
[1:15] and dead
[1:17] culture and education have taken the
[1:19] place of the spirit given word and faith
[1:21] has been superseded by science so that
[1:24] man is a victim of materialism
[1:27] in every attribute ancient laodicea is
[1:29] found reborn in the 20th century
[1:30] laodicean age
[1:32] in the mercy of god may those who have
[1:34] an ear to hear come out of her that they
[1:37] be not partakers of her sins and the
[1:39] consequent judgment
[1:42] the laodicean age
[1:45] the laodicean age began around the turn
[1:47] of the 20th century perhaps 1906
[1:50] how long will it last
[1:52] as a servant of god who has had
[1:53] multitudes of visions of which none has
[1:56] ever failed
[1:57] let me predict i did not say prophesy
[2:00] but predict
[2:01] that this age will end around 1977.
[2:05] if you will pardon a personal note here
[2:07] i based this prediction on seven major
[2:09] continuous visions that came to me one
[2:11] sunday morning in june 1933
[2:14] the lord jesus spoke to me and said that
[2:17] the coming of the lord was drawing nigh
[2:19] but that before he came seven major
[2:21] events would transpire
[2:23] i wrote them all down and that morning i
[2:26] gave forth the revelation of the lord
[2:28] the first vision was that mussolini
[2:30] would invade ethiopia and that nation
[2:32] would fall at his steps
[2:34] that vision surely did cause some
[2:36] repercussions and some were very angry
[2:39] when i said it and would not believe it
[2:41] but it happened that way
[2:43] he just walked in there with his modern
[2:45] arms and took over the natives didn't
[2:47] have a chance
[2:49] but the vision also said that mussolini
[2:51] would come to a horrible end with his
[2:53] own people turning on him
[2:55] that came to pass just exactly as it was
[2:57] said
[2:59] the next vision foretold that an
[3:01] austrian by the name of adolf hitler
[3:03] would rise up as dictator over germany
[3:06] and that he would draw the world into
[3:07] war
[3:08] it showed the siegfried line and how our
[3:10] troops would have a terrible time to
[3:12] overcome it
[3:13] then it showed that hitler would come to
[3:15] a mysterious end
[3:17] the third vision was in the realm of
[3:19] world politics for it showed me that
[3:22] there would be three great isms
[3:24] fascism nazism communism
[3:27] but that the first two would be
[3:29] swallowed up into the third
[3:31] the voice admonished
[3:32] watch russia watch russia
[3:36] keep your eye on the king of the north
[3:39] the fourth vision showed the great
[3:40] advances in science that would come
[3:42] after the second world war
[3:44] it was headed up in the vision of a
[3:45] plastic bubble-topped car that was
[3:47] running down beautiful highways under
[3:49] remote control
[3:50] so that people appeared seated in this
[3:52] car without a steering wheel and they
[3:54] were playing some sort of a game to
[3:56] amuse themselves
[3:58] the fifth vision had to do with the
[4:00] moral problem of our age centering
[4:02] mostly around women
[4:04] god showed me that women began to be out
[4:06] of their place with the granting of the
[4:08] vote
[4:09] then they cut off their hair which
[4:11] signified that they were no longer under
[4:13] the authority of a man but insisted on
[4:15] either equal rights or in most cases
[4:17] more than equal rights
[4:19] she adopted men's clothing and went into
[4:21] a state of undress
[4:23] until the last picture i saw was a woman
[4:25] naked except for a little fig leaf type
[4:27] apron
[4:28] with this vision i saw the terrible
[4:30] perversion and moral plight of the whole
[4:32] world
[4:34] then in the sixth vision there arose up
[4:36] in america a most beautiful but cruel
[4:38] woman
[4:39] she held the people in her complete
[4:41] power
[4:42] i believe that this was the rise of the
[4:44] roman catholic church
[4:46] though i knew it could possibly be a
[4:47] vision of some woman rising in great
[4:49] power in america due to a popular vote
[4:51] by women
[4:53] the last and seventh vision was wherein
[4:56] i heard a most terrible explosion
[4:58] as i turned to look i saw nothing but
[5:00] debris craters and smoke all over the
[5:03] land of america
[5:06] based on these seven visions along with
[5:08] the rapid changes which have swept the
[5:09] world in the last fifty years
[5:11] i predict
[5:13] i do not prophesy
[5:14] that these visions will have all come to
[5:17] pass by nineteen seventy seven
[5:19] and though many may feel that this is an
[5:22] irresponsible statement in view of the
[5:23] fact that jesus said that no man knoweth
[5:26] the day nor the hour
[5:28] i still maintain this prediction after
[5:30] thirty years
[5:32] because jesus did not say no man could
[5:34] know the year month or week in which his
[5:36] coming was to be completed
[5:38] so i repeat
[5:40] i sincerely believe and maintain as a
[5:42] private student of the word
[5:44] along with divine inspiration that 1977
[5:48] ought to terminate the world systems and
[5:50] usher in the millennium
[5:52] now let me say this
[5:54] can anyone prove any of those visions
[5:56] wrong were they not all fulfilled
[5:59] yes each one has been fulfilled or is in
[6:01] the process right now
[6:02] mussolini invaded ethiopia successfully
[6:05] then fell and lost it all
[6:07] hitler started a war he could not finish
[6:09] and died mysteriously
[6:11] communism took over both the other two
[6:13] isms
[6:14] the plastic bubble car has been built
[6:16] and is awaiting only a better network of
[6:18] roads
[6:19] women are all but naked and are even now
[6:21] wearing topless bathing suits
[6:24] and just the other day i saw in a
[6:25] magazine the very dress that i saw in my
[6:27] vision if you can call it a dress
[6:30] it was a plastic transparent type of
[6:32] cloth with three darkened spots that
[6:34] covered both breasts in a small area
[6:37] and then there was a dark place like a
[6:38] small apron below
[6:40] the catholic church is on the rise
[6:43] we have had one catholic president and
[6:45] will no doubt have another
[6:46] what is left
[6:48] nothing except hebrews 12 26
[6:51] whose voice then shook the earth
[6:54] but now he hath promised saying yet once
[6:57] more i shake not the earth only but also
[6:59] heaven
[7:00] once more god will shake the earth and
[7:02] with it shake everything loose that can
[7:04] be shaken
[7:05] then he will renovate it
[7:07] just last march 1964
[7:10] that good friday earthquake of alaska
[7:12] shook the whole world though it did not
[7:14] unbalance it but god was warning by a
[7:17] world tremor what he will soon do on a
[7:19] greater scale
[7:21] he is going to blast and rock this sin
[7:23] cursed world my brother my sister and
[7:25] there is only one place that can stand
[7:27] that shock
[7:28] and that is in the fold of the lord
[7:30] jesus
[7:31] and i would beseech you while god's
[7:33] mercy is still available to you that you
[7:36] give your whole life unreservedly to
[7:38] jesus christ who as the faithful
[7:40] shepherd will save you and care for you
[7:42] and present you faultless in glory with
[7:44] exceeding great joy
[7:47] the messenger
[7:50] i doubt very much if any age truly knew
[7:53] the messenger that god had sent unto it
[7:55] except in the first stage where paul was
[7:57] the messenger
[7:58] and even in that age many did not
[8:00] recognize him for what he was
[8:03] now the age in which we are living is
[8:04] going to be a very short one events are
[8:07] going to transpire very rapidly
[8:09] so the messenger to this laodicean age
[8:11] has to be here now
[8:13] though perhaps we don't know him as yet
[8:15] but there will surely have to be a time
[8:17] that he becomes known
[8:19] now i can prove that because we have
[8:20] scripture that describes his ministry
[8:23] first of all that messenger is going to
[8:25] be a prophet
[8:27] he will have the office of a prophet he
[8:29] will have the prophetic ministry
[8:31] it will be based solidly on the word
[8:33] because when he prophesies or has a
[8:35] vision it will always be word oriented
[8:38] and it will always come to pass
[8:41] he will be vindicated as a prophet
[8:42] because of his accuracy
[8:44] the proof that he is a prophet is found
[8:46] in revelation 10 7
[8:48] but in the days of the voice of the
[8:50] seventh messenger when he shall begin to
[8:52] sound the mystery of god should be
[8:54] finished as he has declared unto his
[8:56] servants the prophets
[8:58] now this person who in this verse is
[9:00] called an angel in the king james
[9:02] version is not an heavenly being
[9:05] the sixth trumpeting angel who is in
[9:07] heavenly being is in revelation 9 13
[9:10] and the seventh of like order is in
[9:12] revelation 11 15.
[9:15] this one here in revelation 10 7 is the
[9:18] seventh age messenger and it is a man
[9:20] and he is to bring a message from god
[9:23] and his message and ministry is going to
[9:25] finish the mystery of god as declared to
[9:27] his servants the prophets
[9:30] god is going to treat this last
[9:31] messenger as a prophet because he is a
[9:34] prophet
[9:35] that is what paul was in the first stage
[9:37] and the last age has one too
[9:40] amos 3 6-7
[9:42] shall a trumpet be blown in the city and
[9:45] the people not be afraid
[9:47] shall there be evil in a city and the
[9:49] lord hath not done it
[9:51] surely the lord will do nothing but he
[9:52] revealeth his secrets unto his servants
[9:55] the prophets
[9:57] it was in the end time period that the
[9:59] seven thunders of jesus came forth
[10:01] revelation 10 3-4
[10:04] and cried with a loud voices when a lion
[10:06] roareth
[10:07] and when he had cried seven thunders
[10:09] uttered their voices
[10:11] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[10:13] their voices i was about to write
[10:15] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[10:17] unto me seal up those things which the
[10:19] seven thunders uttered and write them
[10:21] not
[10:22] what was in those thunders no one knows
[10:25] but we need to know
[10:26] and it will take a profit to get the
[10:28] revelation because god has no other way
[10:30] of bringing out his scriptural
[10:31] revelations except by a prophet
[10:34] the word always came by a prophet and
[10:36] always will
[10:38] that this is the law of god is evident
[10:40] by even a casual search of scripture
[10:42] the unchanging god with unchanging ways
[10:45] invariably sent his prophet in every age
[10:47] where the people had strayed from divine
[10:49] order
[10:50] with both the theologians and the people
[10:52] having departed from the word
[10:54] god always sent his servant to these
[10:56] people but apart from the theologians in
[10:59] order to correct false teaching and lead
[11:01] the people back to god
[11:04] so we see a seventh age messenger coming
[11:06] and he is a prophet
[11:08] not only do we see this messenger coming
[11:10] here in revelation 10 7 but we find that
[11:13] the word speaks of elijah coming before
[11:15] jesus returns
[11:17] in matthew 17 10
[11:19] and his disciples asked him saying
[11:22] why then say the scribes that elias must
[11:24] first come
[11:26] and jesus said
[11:27] elias truly shall first come and restore
[11:30] all things
[11:31] before the coming of our lord elijah
[11:33] must come back for a work of restoration
[11:35] in the church
[11:36] this is what malachi 4 5 says
[11:40] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[11:42] before the coming of the great and
[11:43] dreadful day of the lord and he shall
[11:45] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[11:47] children and the heart of the children
[11:49] to their fathers lest i come and smite
[11:51] the earth with a curse
[11:54] there is absolutely no doubt that elijah
[11:56] must return before the coming of jesus
[11:59] he has a specific work to accomplish
[12:01] that work is the part of malachi 4 6
[12:04] that says
[12:05] he will turn the hearts of the children
[12:07] to their fathers
[12:08] the reason that we know this is his
[12:10] specific work to do at that time is
[12:12] because he has already accomplished the
[12:14] part that says
[12:15] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[12:17] to the children
[12:18] when the elijah ministry was here in
[12:20] john the baptist
[12:22] luke 1 17
[12:24] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[12:26] and power of elijah to turn the hearts
[12:28] of the fathers to the children and the
[12:30] disobedient to the wisdom of the just
[12:33] to make ready a people prepared for the
[12:35] lord
[12:37] in the ministry of john the
[12:39] hearts of the fathers were turned to the
[12:41] children
[12:42] we know that because jesus said so
[12:45] but it does not say that the hearts of
[12:47] the children were turned to the fathers
[12:49] that is yet to take place
[12:51] the hearts of the last day children will
[12:53] be turned back to the pentecostal
[12:54] fathers
[12:56] john got the fathers ready for jesus to
[12:58] welcome the children into the fold
[13:00] now this prophet upon whom the spirit of
[13:02] elijah falls will prepare the children
[13:04] to welcome back jesus
[13:07] jesus called john the baptist elijah
[13:10] matthew 17 12
[13:13] but i say unto you that elijah has come
[13:15] already and they knew him not but have
[13:17] done unto him what they listed
[13:20] the reason that he called john elijah
[13:22] was because the same spirit that was
[13:24] upon elijah had come back upon john
[13:26] even as that spirit had come back upon
[13:28] elisha after the reign of king ahab
[13:32] now once again that spirit will come
[13:34] back upon another man just before jesus
[13:36] comes
[13:37] he will be a prophet
[13:38] he will be vindicated as such by god
[13:41] since jesus himself in the flesh won't
[13:43] be here to vindicate him as he did john
[13:46] it will be done by the holy spirit so
[13:49] that this prophet's ministry will be
[13:50] attended by great and wonderful
[13:52] manifestation
[13:54] as a prophet every revelation will be
[13:56] vindicated for every revelation will
[13:58] come to pass
[13:59] wonderful acts of power will be
[14:01] performed at his commands in faith
[14:04] then will be brought forth the message
[14:06] that god has given him in the word to
[14:08] turn the people back to truth and the
[14:10] true power of god
[14:12] some will listen but the majority will
[14:14] run true to form and reject him
[14:18] since this prophet messenger of
[14:19] revelation 10 7 will be the same as
[14:22] malachi 4 5-6 he will be naturally like
[14:26] elijah and john
[14:27] both were men set apart from the
[14:29] accepted religious schools of their day
[14:32] both were men of the wilderness
[14:34] both acted only when they had thus saith
[14:36] the lord straight from god by revelation
[14:39] both lashed out against the religious
[14:41] orders and leaders of their day
[14:43] but not only was that so they lashed out
[14:46] against all who were corrupt or would
[14:48] corrupt others
[14:49] and notice both prophesied much against
[14:52] immoral women and their ways
[14:54] elijah cried out against jezebel and
[14:56] john rebuked herodius philip's wife
[15:00] though he will not be popular he will be
[15:01] vindicated by god
[15:03] as jesus authenticated john and the holy
[15:06] ghost authenticated jesus we can well
[15:08] expect this man will be first of all
[15:10] authenticated by the spirit working in
[15:12] his life in acts of power that are
[15:14] indisputable and found nowhere else
[15:17] and jesus himself in returning will
[15:19] authenticate him even as he
[15:21] authenticated john
[15:23] john witnessed that jesus was coming and
[15:25] so will this man like john witness that
[15:28] jesus is coming
[15:29] and the very return of christ will prove
[15:31] that this man indeed was the forerunner
[15:33] of his second coming
[15:35] this is the final evidence that this
[15:37] indeed is the prophet of malachi 4
[15:40] for the end of the gentile period will
[15:42] be jesus himself appearing
[15:44] then it will be too late for those who
[15:46] have rejected him
[15:48] in order to further clarify our
[15:50] presentation of this last day profit let
[15:53] us particularly note that the prophet of
[15:54] matthew 11 12 was john the baptist who
[15:58] was the one foretold in malachi 3 1.
[16:01] behold i will send my messenger and he
[16:04] shall prepare the way before me and the
[16:06] lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
[16:08] his temple even the messenger of the
[16:11] covenant whom he delight in
[16:12] behold he shall come saith the lord of
[16:15] hosts
[16:16] matthew 11 1-12
[16:19] and it came to pass when jesus had made
[16:21] an end of commanding his twelve
[16:22] disciples he departed thence to teach
[16:25] and to preach in their cities
[16:27] now when john had heard in the prison
[16:28] the works of christ he sent two of his
[16:31] disciples and said unto him
[16:33] art thou he that should come or do we
[16:35] look for another
[16:37] jesus answered and said unto them
[16:39] go and show john again those things
[16:41] which ye do hear and see
[16:43] the blind receive their sight and the
[16:45] lame walk the lepers are cleansed and
[16:47] the death hear
[16:49] the dead are raised up and the poor have
[16:51] the gospel preached to them
[16:53] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[16:56] offended in me
[16:58] and as they departed jesus began to say
[17:00] under the multitudes concerning john
[17:03] what went ye out into the wilderness to
[17:04] see
[17:05] a reed shaken with the wind
[17:08] but what went ye out for to see
[17:10] a man clothed in soft raiment
[17:13] behold they that wear soft clothing are
[17:15] in king's houses
[17:16] but what went ye out for to see
[17:19] a prophet
[17:20] yea i say unto you and more than a
[17:22] prophet
[17:23] for this is he of whom it is written
[17:26] behold i send my messenger before thy
[17:28] face which shall prepare thy way before
[17:30] thee
[17:31] verily i say unto you
[17:33] among them that are born of women there
[17:34] have not risen a greater than john the
[17:36] baptist notwithstanding he that is least
[17:39] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than
[17:41] he
[17:42] this has already taken place this has
[17:45] happened it is over
[17:47] but note now in malachi 4 1-6
[17:50] for behold the day cometh that shall
[17:53] burn as an oven and all the proud yea
[17:55] and all that do wickedly shall be
[17:57] stubble
[17:58] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[18:00] up saith the lord of hosts that it shall
[18:02] leave them neither root nor branch
[18:05] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[18:07] son of righteousness arise with healing
[18:09] in his wings
[18:10] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[18:13] calves of the stall
[18:15] and ye shall tread down the wicked for
[18:17] they shall be ashes under the soles of
[18:19] your feet in the day that i shall do
[18:21] this saith the lord of hosts
[18:24] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[18:26] which i commanded unto him in horeb for
[18:28] all israel with statutes and judgments
[18:31] behold i will send you elijah the
[18:34] prophet before the coming of the great
[18:36] and dreadful day of the lord
[18:38] and he shall turn the heart of the
[18:39] fathers to the children and the heart of
[18:41] the children to their fathers lest i
[18:44] come and smite the earth with a curse
[18:47] see immediately after the coming of this
[18:49] elijah the earth will be cleansed by
[18:52] fire and the wicked burn to ashes
[18:54] of course this did not happen at the
[18:56] time of john the elijah for his day
[19:00] the spirit of god that prophesied the
[19:01] coming of the messenger in malachi 3 1
[19:04] john was but reiterating his previous
[19:07] prophetic statement of isaiah 43
[19:10] made at least three centuries previously
[19:14] the voice of him that crieth in the
[19:15] wilderness
[19:16] prepare ye the way of the lord make
[19:18] straight in the desert a highway for our
[19:20] god
[19:21] now john by the holy ghost voiced both
[19:24] isaiah and malachi in matthew 3 3.
[19:28] for this is he that was spoken of by the
[19:30] prophet isaias
[19:32] saying
[19:33] the voice of one crying in the
[19:34] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[19:36] lord make his path straight
[19:39] so we can well see from these scriptures
[19:41] that the prophet in malachi 3 who was
[19:43] john was not the prophet of malachi 4
[19:46] though indeed both john and this last
[19:48] day prophet have upon them the same
[19:50] spirit which was upon elijah
[19:54] now this messenger of malachi 4 and
[19:56] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[19:58] things
[19:59] one
[20:00] according to malachi 4 he will turn the
[20:02] hearts of the children to the fathers
[20:04] 2
[20:05] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[20:07] seven thunders in revelation 10 which
[20:09] are the revelations contained in the
[20:11] seven seals
[20:12] it will be these divinely revealed
[20:14] mystery truths that literally turn the
[20:16] hearts of the children to the
[20:17] pentecostal fathers
[20:19] exactly so
[20:21] but consider this also
[20:23] this prophet messenger will be in his
[20:25] nature and manners as were elijah and
[20:27] john
[20:28] the people of this prophet messenger's
[20:30] day will be as they were in ahab's day
[20:33] and in john's
[20:34] and since it is only the children whose
[20:37] hearts will be turned it is only the
[20:39] children who will listen
[20:41] in the days of ahab only 7 000 true seed
[20:44] israelites were found
[20:45] in the days of john there were also very
[20:48] few
[20:48] the masses in both ages were in the
[20:50] fornication of idolatry
[20:53] i want to make one more comparison
[20:55] between the laodicean prophet messenger
[20:57] and john the prophet messenger who
[20:59] preceded jesus first coming
[21:01] the people in john's day mistook him for
[21:03] the messiah john 1 19-20
[21:08] and this is the record of john when the
[21:10] jews sent priests and levites from
[21:12] jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[21:15] and he confessed and denied not
[21:17] but confessed i am not the christ
[21:20] now this last day prophet messenger will
[21:22] have such power before the lord that
[21:24] there will be those who mistake him for
[21:26] the lord jesus
[21:27] there will be a spirit in the world at
[21:29] the end time that will seduce some and
[21:31] make them believe this
[21:33] matthew 24 23-26
[21:36] for there shall arise false christs and
[21:38] false prophets and shall shew great
[21:41] signs and wonders
[21:42] in so much that if it were possible they
[21:45] shall deceive the very elect
[21:47] behold i have told you before
[21:49] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[21:51] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[21:54] behold he is in the secret chambers
[21:57] believe it not
[21:59] but don't you believe it
[22:00] he is not jesus christ he is not the son
[22:03] of god
[22:04] he is one of the brethren a prophet a
[22:07] messenger a servant of god
[22:09] he needs no greater honor bestowed upon
[22:11] him than that which john received when
[22:13] he was the voice that cried
[22:15] i am not he but he is coming after me
[22:20] before we close this section on the
[22:22] messenger of the laodicean age we must
[22:24] seriously consider these two thoughts
[22:27] first
[22:28] this age will have one prophet messenger
[22:30] revelation 10 7 says
[22:33] when he singular shall begin to sound
[22:36] there has never been an age where god
[22:38] gave his people two major prophets at
[22:40] one time
[22:42] he gave enoch alone he gave noah alone
[22:46] he gave moses he alone had the word
[22:48] though others prophesied
[22:51] john the baptist came alone
[22:53] now in this last day there is to be a
[22:55] prophet not a prophetess
[22:58] though in this age there are more women
[23:00] purporting to give god's revelation than
[23:01] men
[23:02] and the infallible word says that he the
[23:05] prophet will reveal the mysteries to the
[23:07] end time people and turn the hearts of
[23:10] the children back to the fathers
[23:12] there are those who say that god's
[23:13] people are going to come together
[23:15] through a collective revelation
[23:17] i challenge that statement
[23:20] it is a bald invalid assumption in the
[23:22] face of revelation 10 7.
[23:24] now i do not deny that people will
[23:26] prophesy in this last age and their
[23:28] ministries can and will be correct
[23:31] i do not deny that there will be
[23:32] prophets even as in the days of paul
[23:34] when there was one agabus a prophet who
[23:37] prophesied of a famine
[23:40] i agree that is so
[23:42] but i deny upon the infallible evidence
[23:44] of the word that there is more than one
[23:47] major prophet messenger who will reveal
[23:49] the mysteries as contained in the word
[23:52] and who has the ministry to turn the
[23:53] hearts of the children to the fathers
[23:56] thus saith the lord by his unfailing
[23:58] word stands and shall stand and be
[24:01] vindicated
[24:02] there is one profit messenger to this
[24:04] age
[24:05] on the basis of human behavior alone
[24:08] anyone knows that where there are many
[24:10] people there is even divided opinion on
[24:12] lesser points of a major doctrine which
[24:13] they all hold together
[24:15] who then will have the power of
[24:17] infallibility which is to be restored in
[24:19] this last age for this last stage is
[24:22] going to go back to manifesting the pure
[24:24] word bride
[24:25] that means we will have the word once
[24:27] again as it was perfectly given and
[24:29] perfectly understood in the days of paul
[24:32] i will tell you who will have it
[24:34] it will be a profit as thoroughly
[24:36] vindicated or even more thoroughly
[24:38] vindicated than was any profit in all
[24:40] the ages from enoch to this day
[24:43] because this man will of necessity have
[24:45] the capstone prophetic ministry
[24:47] and god will shew him forth
[24:50] he won't need to speak for himself god
[24:52] will speak for him by the voice of the
[24:54] sign
[24:55] amen
[24:57] the second thought that must be
[24:58] impressed on our hearts is that the
[25:00] seven church ages started out with the
[25:02] antichrist spirit as well as the holy
[25:04] spirit who is to be blessed forever
[25:07] first john 4 1
[25:10] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[25:13] the spirits whether they are of god
[25:15] because many false prophets are gone out
[25:17] into the world
[25:19] did you notice it the antichrist spirit
[25:22] is identified with false prophets
[25:24] the ages came in with false prophets and
[25:26] they will go out with false prophets
[25:29] now of course there is going to be a
[25:30] real false prophet in the grand sense of
[25:33] that man mentioned in the revelation
[25:36] but as of now before his revelation
[25:38] there are to appear many false prophets
[25:40] matthew 24 23-26
[25:44] then if any man shall say unto you
[25:47] lo here is christ or there believe it
[25:49] not
[25:50] for there shall arise false christs and
[25:52] false prophets and shall shew great
[25:55] signs and wonders
[25:56] in so much that if it were possible they
[25:59] shall deceive the very elect
[26:01] behold i have told you before
[26:03] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[26:05] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[26:08] behold he is in the secret chambers
[26:11] believe it not
[26:13] these false prophets are earmarked for
[26:15] us in various other scriptures such as
[26:17] the following
[26:19] second peter 2 1-2
[26:22] but there were false prophets also among
[26:24] the people even as there shall be false
[26:26] teachers among you who privily shall
[26:28] bring in damnable heresies even denying
[26:31] the lord that bought them and bring upon
[26:33] themselves swift destruction
[26:35] and many shall follow their pernicious
[26:37] ways by reason of whom the way of truth
[26:39] shall be evil spoken of
[26:42] second timothy 4 3-4
[26:45] for the time will come when they will
[26:46] not endure sound doctrine
[26:48] but after their own lusts shall they
[26:50] heap to themselves teachers having
[26:52] itching ears and they shall turn away
[26:54] their ears from the truth and shall be
[26:56] turned unto fables
[26:58] first timothy 4 1
[27:00] now the spirit speaketh expressly that
[27:03] in the latter times some shall depart
[27:05] from the faith giving heed to seducing
[27:07] spirits and doctrines of devils
[27:10] now in every case you will notice that a
[27:12] false prophet is one who is outside the
[27:15] word
[27:16] just as we showed you that antichrist
[27:18] means anti-word
[27:20] so these false prophets come perverting
[27:22] the word
[27:23] giving it a meaning that fits their own
[27:25] devilish ends
[27:26] have you ever noticed how the people who
[27:28] lead others astray bind them closely to
[27:30] themselves by fear
[27:32] they say that if the people don't do
[27:34] what they say or if they leave then
[27:36] destruction will follow
[27:38] they are false prophets for a true
[27:40] prophet will always lead one to the word
[27:42] and bind the people to jesus christ and
[27:45] he won't tell the people to fear him or
[27:47] what he says but to fear what the word
[27:49] says
[27:51] notice how these people like judas are
[27:53] out for money they get you to sell all
[27:55] you have and give it to them and their
[27:57] schemes
[27:58] they spend more time on offerings than
[28:00] the word
[28:01] those who attempt to operate gifts will
[28:03] make use of a gift which has a margin of
[28:05] error in it and then ask for money
[28:08] and neglect the word and call it of god
[28:11] and people will go to them and bear with
[28:13] them and support them and believe them
[28:15] not knowing it is the way of death
[28:18] yes the land is full of carnal
[28:20] impersonators
[28:21] in that last day they will try to
[28:23] imitate that prophet messenger
[28:26] the seven sons of siva tried to imitate
[28:28] paul simon the sorcerer tried to imitate
[28:31] peter their impersonations will be
[28:34] carnal they won't be able to produce
[28:36] what the true prophet produces
[28:38] when he says the revival is over they
[28:40] will go around claiming a great
[28:42] revelation that what the people have is
[28:44] exactly right and god is going to do
[28:46] bigger and more wonderful things amongst
[28:48] the people
[28:49] and the people will fall for it
[28:52] these same false prophets will claim
[28:54] that the messenger of the last day is
[28:55] not a theologian so he ought not to be
[28:58] heard
[28:59] they won't be able to produce what the
[29:01] messenger can
[29:02] they won't be vindicated by god as that
[29:04] last day prophet is
[29:06] but with their great swelling words and
[29:08] with the weight of their worldwide
[29:10] notoriety they will warn the people not
[29:12] to hear that man messenger and they will
[29:15] say he teaches wrong
[29:17] they are running exactly true to their
[29:19] fathers the pharisees who were of the
[29:22] devil for they claimed that both john
[29:24] and jesus taught error
[29:26] now why do these false prophets come
[29:28] against the true prophet and discredit
[29:30] his teaching
[29:31] because they are running true to form as
[29:33] did their forefathers when in the days
[29:35] of ahab they withstood micaiah
[29:38] there were 400 of them and all of them
[29:40] were in agreement
[29:42] and by them all saying the same thing
[29:44] they fooled the people
[29:46] but one prophet just one was right and
[29:49] all the rest wrong
[29:51] because god had committed the revelation
[29:53] to only one
[29:54] [Music]
[30:24] you
