TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I wondered this morning if there'd just be someone here who realized that you [Music] [Music] Southwest United States. His name is Daniel Curry. A wonderful man, a godly man, a sainted man, a real Christian, a man that everybody thought so much of. Such a wonderful person. And the story goes that he died or went into a trance. And he said, "Have you went up to heaven?" Of course, when he died. And when he got to the pearly gates, the caretaker come to the door said, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm the evangelist Daniel Curry. I've won thousands of souls to Christ, and I'm I want to come in this morning. My life's journey is ended on earth. I have no place to go now." That's where it's coming to you some morning, sinner. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the way it's coming to you, backslider. It's the way it's coming to you is grieve the Holy Spirit away from them. &gt;&gt; Not be gentle and tender anymore. You haven't cried for years. You haven't blushed right on them when all modest is gone from you. Sure, but it's going to come to your door one of these mornings. And as a gentle Holy Spirit comes and knocks, why don't you just let him in? So when Daniel Curry come there to to to the gate, they went in and said, "We'll see if you got your name here." They looked all around. They couldn't find any name. Said, "No, there's no Daniel Curry here." Oh, he said, "Surely said, I'm an evangelist." He said, "I've won souls to Christ." Said, "I'VE TRIED TO DO THE THING. It's right." The caretaker said, "Sir, I'm sorry to tell you, but there's no Daniel Curry here." Said, "I'll tell you what you might do." Said, "We have no rights here to take your case." He said, "But do you want to appeal your case?" You can appeal it to the white throne judgment if you want to, but said, "We have no mercy here for you at all because we don't have you here. There's no mercy for you." Said, "Do you want to appeal your case?" He said, "Sir, what more can I do but appeal my case?" He said, "Well, then you can go up the white throne judgment and appeal your case there." Daniel Kerr, he said that he felt himself going through the space for about an hour. Said he come into a place that got lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter. Said farther he went, the lighter it got. It was a hundred times, thousands of times brighter than the sun ever shine. and said he was trembling, trembling. And said when he got in the middle of that light, he heard a voice say, "Was you perfect on earth?" Just come out of the light. He said, "No, I wasn't perfect." God trimmed said, "Did you always play honest with everybody?" Said, "No." said, "A few things come to my mind that I wasn't just exactly honest about." Said, "No, I I I guess I wasn't honest." Said, "Did you tell the truth in every case in your life?" Said, "No, I remember some things I told wasn't shady. It was shady. I I I never was truthful." Just exactly. Said, "Ban, did you ever take anything that did not belong to you? anything, money, anything else that didn't belong to you. Said he thought on earth that he was pretty good, but he was condemned. Said, "No, no, I've took things that didn't belong to me." He said, "Then you wasn't perfect." He said, "No, I wasn't perfect." said he was looking any minute for the blast to come in that great light from where the dove rested condemned. Said just then he heard a voice behind him that was sweeter than any mother's voice he'd ever heard. Said he turned to look and the sweetest face he ever saw, sweeter than any mother's face is standing before him. and said, he said, "Father, Daniel Curry stood for me down on earth." It's true. He wasn't perfect, but he stood for me. He stood for me on earth. Now, I'm going to stand for him IN HEAVEN. TAKE ALL OF HIS sins &gt;&gt; and put him over on my account. &gt;&gt; Who's going to stand for you that day, brother? &gt;&gt; If he grieve him away from you today, &gt;&gt; I just can't preach anymore. Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Hey dear God, dear dying lamb, meek, humble, low, the birds had nest. The foxes had den, but you didn't have a place. And yet the very Lord of glory. When you were born, they didn't have any clothes to put on you. Oh God, what good my clothes do me? WHAT GOOD DOES MY CARS DO ME? WHAT GOOD DOES A NICE HOME do me? WHAT GOOD YOU GOING TO DO THAT DAY? You was friendless. No one would friend you. No one seemed no one to give you a helping hand. You said that day you say I was hungry and you didn't feed me. &gt;&gt; I was naked. You wouldn't clothe me. WHAT GOOD'S ALL WE GOT GOING TO DO AT THAT DAY? LORD, &gt;&gt; let us stand for you. &gt;&gt; So that when that hour comes and we walk into his presence, the omnipotent, om, I'm the present. Oh God, when we hear that dove with his wings setting back there in that great light that'll flash through all eternity. When you dwell in night, when I have to stand there by myself, &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER'S GONE, MY PASTOR'S GONE, my mother's gone, my daddy's gone, my wife's gone, my kitties are gone. Oh, God. Why am I GOING TO DO THAT, LORD? WHY AM I GOING TO DO THAT? That may BE BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN TONIGHT. What am I going to do? What can I do? &gt;&gt; Oh Christ, I'll stand for you now. &gt;&gt; I'll take MY CHOICE TODAY. I'LL FAR FROM ALL MY TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. I'LL FAR FROM ALL MY TEMPER. I'LL FAR FROM ALL MY DIFFERENCES. I'M FAR FROM EVERYTHING. SURE ME OFF, LORD. &gt;&gt; TAKE ALL THIS I GOT. JUST THANK ME LORD. I I I WANT TO STAND IN YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; I want to be sheared. I want all selfishes, all pride, all indifference, &gt;&gt; just all taken off of me. &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO STAND FOR YOU AS A SHEARED LAMB. &gt;&gt; Willing to give up all the pleasures of what they call pleasures of life. All the dances, all the parties, all the old vulgar clothes, makeup, lipstick, fingernail polish, all the indifference that looks like the world. You said don't even act like the world. Don't even associate WITH THE WORLD. COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM. Oh God, HELP ME. LORD, SHEAR ME TODAY. &gt;&gt; TAKE ME LIKE A LAMB. LET ME BE DUMB. DON'T OPEN MY MOUTH AND SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT. JUST STAND AND BE SHEARED. Oh God, what difference it makes. I remember when you shared me once, took my wife, my baby, my daddy, my brother. &gt;&gt; You shared me clean. &gt;&gt; Yet in my heart I knew I loved you. &gt;&gt; How you blessed me, how good you've been. All that I am, all that I could be, all that I have would be. It's you, God. It's you. &gt;&gt; I confess my wrongs. I confess all that I've ever done or thought. Just shear me off, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to be your lamb. &gt;&gt; Not only that, Lord, but take every person in here this morning. &gt;&gt; Every sheep &gt;&gt; and those who would want to be sheep, &gt;&gt; sure all of them off this morning, Lord. put their little feet around the stalks of the gospel. &gt;&gt; May the Holy Spirit lead them to repentance just now, know that they've been indifferent towards God. &gt;&gt; And may you shure all the indifference off all the world and all the things of the world. You sure it all off this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; That we can stand cool and quiet before you as born again Christians. &gt;&gt; Ready? Lord, I love you. I want to go. No matter where the weather's hot, whether feel like it or not, &gt;&gt; I want to go. I want to stand for you. &gt;&gt; God, I want you to plead my case that day. &gt;&gt; Say, well, he stood for me. I'll stand for him. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Granted, today and while it ever head is bowed and every heart's bowed, I wondered this morning if there'd just be someone here who realize that you tried to have your own way. You made these things that you shouldn't done. Any of you this morning you like for the Lord just to shear you off and say make you a real lamb. Would you raise your hand? God bless you, lady. God bless you, brother. God bless you, brother. Someone else say, "Share me, Lord. I'm standing. I'm a sheep. I won't even open my mouth. I just want you to cut all the world away from me. God bless you, brother. God bless you, lady. God bless you, Sunny boy. God bless you, lady. God bless you, sister. Share me, Lord." Sister Gertie said, "God bless you, lady. God bless you, sister. Share me now, Lord. I want all the things of the world. I want to stand for you this morning. I want to stand as a shore and sheep. I want all the things of the world cut away from me. I want to be yours and you be mine. Will you receive me, Lord, as I raise my hand to you. God bless you, lady. God bless you, sir. God bless you. God bless you, sir. God bless you, sir. God bless you, lady. God bless you, lady. I see your God bless you, my brother. God bless you, little lady. That's good. God bless you back there, my brother. God bless you, sister. That's right. Just be honest. I want God TO TAKE ALL AWAY from me that's just not like him. &gt;&gt; Any selfish motives I have. Any indifference that I have. I want him to share me all the way off this morning. &gt;&gt; I want to be like him. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether rights or not. I ain't got no rights. &gt;&gt; I only have one right. That's come to him. &gt;&gt; He takes the rest. Is there a sinner here that's never once confessed Christ, never been saved, and you want to be remembered in this prayer this morning? Would you raise your hand, sinner friend? God bless you. Another one, raise your hand, say, "Remember me." Brother Brandham, I'm not a Christian. I don't know this what time I'm going to have to meet God, and I I want to be remembered right now. A word of prayer as you close. Will you raise your hand for me to pray for you? He said, "God bless you, little lady. God bless you, lady. God bless you, sir." Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone else I want to be. I want the How many here that's backsliding? Oh, you say, "I wouldn't admit that, Brother Brandon." But look, if that dove of meekness is gone from you, brother, there's something wrong. There's something wrong when you can't bear with one another. when he can't forgive every person from the very depths of your heart. No matter what they've done or what they've said, if you can't forgive them from the death, Jesus said, "If you don't forgive every man his trespasses from your heart, neither does your heavenly father forgive you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what if this hot weather? What if today God would call you? Father, there's a fountain open, a church ready, the Holy Spirit sitting here at the Gabriel end of this building, ready to come right down and come back in your heart, make you gentle and peaceful. What must I do, Brother Brand? Just become a lamb. The Holy Spirit will come right down when you become a lamb. But if you got the wrong motives, long wrong idea, want to have your own way, not willing to far it, then the Holy Spirit will ever come. Now with our heads bowed, I wonder if any of you that's raised your hand. Now Jesus said, "He that hearth my words and believeth on him has sent me has everlasting life, shall never come into judgment, but pass from death to life." St. John 5:24. But now, if you'd like to come to the altar, kneel down here. Let's pray together to that gentle peaceful feeling that you once possessed or would like to possess comes to you again. While we were keeping our heads bowed, while we sing there is the fountain filled with blood, I want you to come kneel down and pray everyone now. And once they come, kneel down here at the altar and pray about them. There is a sound you with amen your name and send your blood if need God bless you lady. Come right up and kneel down. Luke, [Music] with your heads bowed, as I hope you have in your heart, you know who breaks down the aisle this morning. I want to make you shame yourself. A colored woman, poor thing, swelled up ankles, gray hair, makes her way down to the altar here. Some time ago, an old colored man got saved in the slave town. He went and as he was saved, he told his boss he is free. He said, "You're watching. I'm free." Then he made him free. Here comes another group of people coming down for salvation this morning. Said he was free. everybody in prayer and praying hard if you will while the Holy Spirit deals with the people making decision. [Music] He said, "Moses, you say you was free?" He said, "Yes, sir boss, I'm free." Said, "If you're free, then I'm going to make you free, too, to go preach the gospel." When he got ready to die, man of his white brethren come in to see him. When they did, he said, thought he's in a coma. When he woke up, he said, "I thought I was gone." God bless you, my brother. Just kneel right there. Said, "I thought I was already gone." So, what did you see, Moses? He said, "When I walked in the gate, I saw him. said I stand looking at him and said there's an angel come up and said come on Mo you done preached the gospel many years you got a robe and a crown waiting for you said don't talk to me about robe and crowns I don't want no robe and crown I just want to look at him [Music] I think that's the attitude of any Christian sometime ago way out of Chicago was in a coliseum a museum rather I was looking all around in there. I seen an old negro, little white rim of hair around his head moving around there with his hat in his hand. I looked at him. He looked over into a little place and he jumped back and tears began to run down his old dark cheek. He started praying. I watched him for a little while. He looked over again, started crying again. I walked over and I said, "Sir," he said, "Yes, white friend." I said, 'I see your what excited you so? What are you so excited about? He said, sir, if you could feel my side, I got a calluses around my side. Said, I once was a slave. He said, in this little glass cage here, that's a dress laying there. I said, I see it's a dress, but what's so peculiar about that? He said, that spot on there, said that's the blood of Abraham Lincoln. said, "That blood's taking a slave belt off of me." He said, "That white man, WOULDN'T IT COME EXCITE YOU, TOO?" I put my arm around his old neck. I said, "GOD BLESS YOU, BROTHER. I KNOW ANOTHER BLOOD EXCITES ME." He said, "I know that blood, too, mister." I said, "He tuck a sleigh belt off of me." One time I get out on Sunday and race and carry on and tell dirty jokes and oh God, how did I do it? &gt;&gt; Still these scars down in my heart were done. But I'm glad he took the bell off of me. It's &gt;&gt; all gone now. He stood in my place. You're some time ago looking at a woman and her she's so vulgar. I want to condemn her. God gave me a vision. I prayed for her then for I see that my sins is as great as hers. &gt;&gt; I walked over and sat down by the side of her and shamed her. Told her I was a minister. Her two boyfriend, she's about 65 or 70. Her two boyfriends knelt down there and they all give their heart to Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a difference. &gt;&gt; Won't you? Have you just sinned so much this morning? Have you just got your heart so black and smutty till even the Holy Spirit can't even touch it? Maybe the dove is tuck its eternal flight. It's gone forever. God bless you, honey. A little girl walking up. God bless you, sweetheart. You say that little girl doesn't know. Oh, yes, she does. She just hasn't read as many magazines and old love stories as you all have. What's the matter? She's tender. Jesus said for the little children to come to me. Hey, someone else would like to come join around this morning. The altar's open just another moment. Then while we sing once more and we're going to offer prayer while these penitent sinners are praying the dying feet rejoice to see that th [Music] everything was gone. The poor fellow was finished and there may I [Music] ask you. Won't you come up now? Won't you come up you who know better? The Bible said if you know to do good do it not to you. It's more than sin. Once you come, you know you're wrong. Make your way up, kneel around the altar, and tell God you're sorry for the way you've treated him. Let the Holy Spirit come back, make you meek and gently, quiet again. Won't you remember if you die and he's gone for you, be nobody to plead your case. He's want you to stand for him this morning. [Music] God bless you, my brother. waiting. Is this it? This 15 in the church that really feels that you've been condemned. You've lived a peaceful, meek, gentle, quiet life. Now, this is directed by the Holy Spirit. You're forgiving. Have no image. living a past above the condemnation of sinners. You don't live like the heathens. You live different. Your life's all patterned different. The gentle Holy Spirit sitting on the throne of your heart, making you live peacefully and quiet and loving around all people. Your neighbors and all know and all your associates know that you're a gentle, quiet, meek, humble Christian. The dove of God is with you. Be sure this may be your last opportunity. All right. And to you here at the altar, God bless you. You won't have to be judged now. The Holy Spirit's brought judgment to you. You didn't try to hold your rights. Oh, I've been a Christian long enough. I don't have to go. Some of you, your first time to ever be at the altar. I can stay a sinner if I want to. That's my rights. Yep. That's right. You're free moral agent. You can act any way you want to. But you rights this morning say what would they say me professing Christianity they going up to the altar what would they say but what God saying he said for you to come and you did it now you fared your rights you come to have the gentle Holy Spirit to take its place in your heart today I know he'll do it I know he will he promised he will there it just can't help it just can't help from coming he's begging crying died and everything else for a place to come to wanting to come to you. And in your hours of death when the death angel sitting on the foot of the bed instead of looking out there at a hideous thing and know that you refused to come one time and then your soul become black and smutty. No more time. No matter how hard you cried, Esau sended away his sin of grace, his day of grace rather, and didn't get a chance. He wept bitterly trying to find a place to make it right, but he couldn't do it. God called him the last time. But you forfeitered all your rights and all your friends and all your feelings and everything this morning to come here. You forfeited your rights to kneel down here to talk to God. I'm telling you by the word of the Lord that Christ said, "He that comes to me, [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
