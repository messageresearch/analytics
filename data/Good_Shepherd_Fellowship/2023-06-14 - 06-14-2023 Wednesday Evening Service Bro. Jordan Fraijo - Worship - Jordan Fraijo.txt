again together again the saving the Lord let's do that again we're together again [Music] here together again just plaging the Lord amen amen it's just so wonderful to be here again with all of you with that opportunity to praise the Lord you know it I think so many times we take it so lightly that we can come here that that we have this opportunity that that you can praise the Lord you know that's a privilege to be able to come here is a privilege that's one to be able to praise the Lord is a privilege in and of itself it's not just something that you belongs to you or just a you you get to have it's a privilege it's something God has given you you don't have to sneak around you don't have to hide nowhere you don't have to wonder who's going to see you I mean many of us sometimes I think we do we wonder well who's going to see me if I praise that way who cares who cares the only person we care if they he sees us is if God sees us when we're praising him because if he sees us and he's pleased then we know he'll come down in our midst and you'll feel his presence come down and and then you won't even be able to worry you'll know more about what you look like when you're praising because when that presence comes down you'll just let loose it'll be all over then and that's what we want so I say just let go now don't wait for the right time don't wait for for oh I don't know I just don't feel just right just praise anyways you know when Paul and Silas were there in prison they didn't feel too good I don't think they'd been beaten they'd been whipped they'd been thrown in a dungeon it wasn't the even the the nice prisons of the of America it wasn't the prisons that they got thrown into would make prisons anywhere today look nice it was a place of Torment and yet they begin to praise in spite of that they didn't wait for their situation to get better first they say we're going to praise the Lord and as they begin to praise the Lord they were set free and that's a key for us to follow yet today is If you find yourself in any form of bondage do you find yourself held down if you found the enemy coming against you in any way you can't seem to break free just begin to praise and when his presence come down the enemy won't be able to stay and you'll be set free it's just a wonderful thing let's why don't you just give him a hand of Praise here this evening wonderful [Applause] [Music] one thank you musicians you can be seated I just wanna jump right into my subject here I know if if I don't I just get more nervous and so if all of you would want to turn with me to the scripture to John 4 and verse 20. you know I really enjoyed that service on Sunday and I figured we just kind of jump on with that and kind of follow up behind here and maybe just touch on a little bible study subject I hope we'll bless all of you and it reads like this our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye no not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just pray that you just come down and have your way this evening father that you just set me to the side and use this vessel Lord to your purpose Lord I ask you to bless your people and Lord for their Lord for coming out here this evening and pushing past all the things that might have gotten the way father in life and troubles and issues and anything that might have tried to slow them down and yet they persevered and came through anyways Lord I ask you'd bless them for that father Lord may you just come and have your way father this evening Lord we should be sure to give you all the honor the glory and the praise in Jesus name amen you may be seated I just want to take a subject one word as a subject tonight and that's worship you know I think there's many times that we'll read a scripture like this and and read about worship and how to Worship in Christ speaking of how people would worship and we rush right over that thinking well I understand what that means And yet when you go to dig in I think we'd be shocked I am many times to find out that the meaning we've given it has been quite shallow for quite some time and so I just want to take and break it down a little bit here this evening just something simple and go bit by bit and walk us through it and see what is worship what does that mean where it says go out of spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth what does it mean to worship Him and we'll start out and I just want to take the word and I just pulled the dictionary definition out for us and we're going to break it down a little bit and then we're going to go in and pull some examples from the scripture the word worship is to honor or show reverence for a Divine being or Supernatural power to regard with great or extravagant respect honor or devotion reverence offered a Divine being or Supernatural power an act of expressing such reverence extravagant respect or admiration for or Devotion to an object of esteem now in today's day and time and amongst religious Realms and churches if I was to say we're all getting together for a worship service someone would have told that to me it's like oh it's going to be a singing service that's what we're doing that's worship well it's a part of worship but it's not worship because there's many people who get together and sing what we would call a worship song who have never worshiped a day in their life they think they are but they have yet begun to worship now there's a couple of words in here in this definition that stood out to me and I thought well what do what does that mean now we've kind of taken that worship definition but there's more in here that I'm like there's there's more depth to this and the first one is the word reverence what does reverence mean if worship is to honor or show reverence to a Divine being what does the word reverence mean perhaps many of us have seen the word read the word use the word or possibly our whole lives and we have an idea of what it means reverence is to honor or respect honor or respect felt or shown especially profound adoring odd respect a gesture of respect the state of being revered now the next here I just put this on the end revered means regarded as worthy of great honor and respect so now we know reverence is a part of worship reverence is regarding as worthy of great honor and respect profound adoring odd respect that's a whole mouthful there profound adoring odd respect that's a whole slew of emotions it's that feeling where you don't know whether to smile laugh or cry you don't know whether to bow down on your face and never get back up or to dance around the room it's that feeling that just comes down you just don't know what to do with it you have such odd respect adoring if you were to break that down to a door is is a love expanded this is worship so for you to be able to worship this has got to be a part of it when you step in and you're entering into worship these are all the things that if you want to start making a list and going am I worshiping are all these things being met am I coming to him with profound respect as I enter into his presence as I ask him to come down and move in my life am I adoring him am I odd in his presence to the point this is what happened in the building of Solomon's Temple when they came to dedicate the temple and Solomon began to pray he entered into worship and when the spirit of God came down there was such an awe on the people that even the ministers could not Minister anymore they had entered into true worship the other word here describing worship that stood out to me was devotion foreign devotion is the act of dedicating something to a cause Enterprise or activity the act of devoting the devotion of a great deal of time and energy and the fact or state of being ardently dedicated and loyal so not only do all these emotions feelings have to mix in the odd respect the proof the odd respect profound adoring when you begin to worship but worship is directly tied to dedication and loyalty so this is not a one-time thing this is not something you do on a Sunday or a Wednesday worship is much greater than that and if we're going to understand what he meant when he said that they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth then we have to understand what worship is it's not a Sunday and Wednesday occasion not because we felt the spirit on when we were in service when you walked out you were dry as a bone you never began to worship you felt an anointing you were blessed enough to be in the presence of an anointing that you couldn't help but feel it was so strong and it made you jump and run and dance but don't get overly excited about that because we know that in the field with the wheat and the tares when the rain came they both praised the Lord they both praised the Lord they both shouted they both jumped they were both energized just as much but when they went out the door the tear was still a tear and the wheat was still weak so the only one that could actually enter into real worship was the wheat because the life of the wheat continued to produce the same whether in the midst of the rain or not it was still wheat but if you would have looked at the field when the rain's coming down you're like they're all the same they're all Sons and Daughters of God they're all praising and worshiping look at how God's moving on them but the difference was worship one was just entering into an excitement the other one was entering into worship got one more definition for you and that's the word homage and it's not in the course of that definition of worship but as you begin to work yourself down through this and see all the things that are tied to it this word came to my mind and homage was a feudal ceremony by which a man acknowledged himself the vassal of a lord something that shows respect or attest to the Worth or influence of another and where this came from was in medieval times a king's male subject could officially become the king's man or vassal by publicly announcing allegiance to the Monarch in a formal ceremony in that ritual known as homage the subject now and placed his hand between those of his Lord symbolically surrendering himself and putting himself at the Lord's disposal and under his jurisdiction a bond was thus forged between the two the vassals part was to Revere and serve his Lord worship and the Lord's role was to protect the vassal and his family this is an example of true worship it's the surrendering of your will the surrendering of All That You Are to him your family your thoughts your ideas everything that makes up Who You Are fully surrendered as the King's Men as a daughter son and daughter of God you come in a full surrender as his vassal this is worship you've surrendered everything to him you said You are My All and I will serve you no matter what there's no pure formal worship that God has ever asked of his people from the time of this I also thought that the way it had to be done ties into our our life as well is that he the individual couldn't just do it secretly there couldn't be a secret vassal they had a publicly announce Allegiance in a formal ceremony and and Proclaim it before all the people everyone knew from that time forward that person is identified with that King and that brought that protection over that man and his family because anyone knew now that that man had fully surrendered himself to the King and his will that the man was fully under the protection of the king and to do anything against the man was to do something against the king but if you didn't Proclaim it publicly no one knows they don't know you're protected by nobody and I think many times in our worship we find ourselves in that same place we're so worried about what our co-workers will think if they find out what we believe or how we worship well don't worry if you're worried about that you're not worshiping yet you're so worried about the people at school what what they'll think about you you're so worried about how people will perceive you or what if and you know why Phil I'm already strange enough and what if I'm if I do this and I fully commit what if it makes me even stranger hmm then you're not ready for this yet you're not ready you're not ready to Worship in spirit and in truth but you can be that can change at any time [Music] now something that just was special to me as I started studying and I started looking into this word worship I want to know when did it when was the first time it's it's comes up in Scripture who was the first worshiper and the first time it comes up is in Genesis 22 4 and 5. then on the third day Abraham lift up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I in the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you you see I thought it was quite interesting that the first worshiper was the father of faith who better to be the first one to know how to Worship in spirit and in truth that God would come down and have that relationship with because in order to be a worshiper you have a unique relationship with the father you and God have a relationship just like this vassal in his King you can no longer be separated and Abraham if you notice the instance here where he he says I in the lateral go Yonder and worship if you know the story this is right before he's about to go up the mountain when God has required of him to sacrifice Isaac his only son the very thing that he fought and strove for the very thing that he stayed faithful to the promise for his whole life God sent him out and said I will bless you he said I'll give you a seed and he stayed faithful and this was a thing that was promised to him this was his reward for all those years of being faithful and now God comes and says kill him and here he is just moments away from it happening and he says I in the lad will go Yonder and worship you see if we read this with our past understanding of worship we think wow they're just that means that him and Isaac gonna go sing a few songs pray a little while no he said I'm going to worship which means I am fully surrendering my will my desires to God I hold him up before me and reverence him as a supernatural power and if he has asked this of me I am going to worship I'm not going to ask why I'm not going to push back I'm not going to push against his authority no question on the sacrifice because if he would have if he would have questions God's Authority he wouldn't have been able to worship and we'll see that Abraham in the scripture when I see this you see you can say well how do you can you say he's the first worshiper many of people prayed to God many people provided sacrifices many people from that all the way from Adam and Abel and Noah I can see where they all had altars and they gave sacrifices unto the Lord yeah they did Abraham did too but this is the first time he worshiped because he'd gone through everything he'd he'd presented the sacrifices not from out of understanding but because he felt like this was something he could do it was a part of his religion and yet he still fought and tried to do it on his own we know the time when God required the sacrifices of him of the turtle doves and the different animals there and he had to cut so many in half and lay them out that Abraham still wasn't in a state of worship because he thought there was still something he had to do for it to be successful for it to be successful God needs my help and he ran around and he ran around and he ran around trying to protect the sacrifice because he felt God's sacrifices needed his protection and he doesn't realize it was the other way around and God wasn't able to able to come down and move on the scene until he did with Abraham like he did with Adam and he put him to sleep he said that's enough I've watched you run around long enough and he let him go to sleep and that he was able to come and speak to him but he was over Abraham's life and experiences and the things that he went through that built him up to this place where he came to this place he said now I can worship now I recognize God as an extravagant power a Divine being that needs no help from me one that I profoundly adore and I am just in awe of every day whatever he asked me to do that I will do that was his worship his worship wasn't the sacrifice his worship wasn't even the sacrifice of Isaac his worship was his obedience to the word see Abraham was no longer just sacrificing and obeying out of fear of judgment Abraham had become a worshiper in Joshua 5 13 and 15 we see Joshua also here and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as a captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto a servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place wherein thou standeth is Holy and Joshua did so you see worship immediately came with obedience unquestioned obedience when he recognized who he was in the presence of he worshiped he didn't wait he didn't question it well do I really need to take off my shoes like what's the problem like God preserved these shoes for the last 40 years so they're kind of holy too um like what's the re what's your reason for this no when he stood in that presence and he knew who he was in the presence of he worshiped and obedience was a part of that worship instant he didn't question it he said if you want to take off my shoes sure what else do you want me to do whatever you want me to do I'm here to worship in the message show us the father and it suffice us who random says that age-old cry if I could only find God the all ages people are born to worship you'll worship something maybe it's your child your car your home your job maybe even your church that will not work it isn't the church we worship it's God the cavemen the Indians the American Indian we found that he worshiped the son and he believed there was a happy Hunting Ground when one died they put the corn and so forth his bow and arrow and sent him out across the sea somewhere in his canoe that he would find the Happy Hunting Ground where he would have provision to carry him over there's something in the human heart that calls out for a worship somewhere no man is on Earth without worship he worships something Jesus told the woman at the well you worship ye know not what we know salvations of the Jews now worship is not all we desire there's a provided way of worship did you know that see there's a way to worship and a way right way to worship and the wrong way to worship I'm not trying to tell you which way to worship that I'm telling you there's a way that you have to approach God and if you don't do not come that provided way you certainly cannot find God there's a way for me to go home not across the field shortcut go the highway that was the that was made it's provided for me God don't have any shortcuts we all come the same way that's right no shortcuts to Glory we must come the way look in the beginning when Cain and Abel were turned from the garden their parents and they both seen they were mortal beings and no they had to die look Cain and Abel both of them wanted to worship God and Cain he built an altar to God now if an altar is all that God requires Cain was justified and Cain made a sacrifice upon the altar is that right well if a sacrifice and an altar is all God wants Cain was justified if all God wanted was a Altar and a sacrifice a building and people to come in it give a little time sacrifice a little their time sacrifice a little their money you know do their their religious obligation sacrifice altar you have them Cain would have been good and so would everyone else then Kano also also built an altar and he worshiped he put a sacrifice on it and he knelt down and worshiped God but God was displeased because he didn't come the right way see he built a church in an altar he put a sacrifice on the altar brought the fruits of the land was probably the more beautiful you must watch this friends don't ever never forget this Genesis 4 3-5 and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and the fact thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell you see because Cain didn't want to worship he wanted to be worshiped and I say that because you read here in the Scripture it says the Lord had respect unto Abel's offering see God respected Abel's obedience to the Revelation he had given him Cain didn't get that revelation but when he complained about it if you continue reading in the story when he complained about it to God and he was angry God said hey I know you didn't get the same memo but now that you're angry and you want to talk about it go do like your brother if you do like your brother I'll accept you I will respect your offering even though I had to spell it out for you what I want God says I'll tell you exactly what to do go do exactly as your brother take a lamb offer that to me he took all the mystery out of it Cain didn't even need a revelation at that point all he needed to do was take the step-by-step instruction God had given him and go and do it and he would have had God's respect but like his father he wasn't looking to get respect for obedience he was looking to get respect and be worshiped as God because he was under that same spirit that was anointing him he wasn't looking to serve God he wanted to be God and that's where many a church and person individuals find themselves is that you want to force God to accept your sacrifice the thing that you believe is Worthy because you're falling under that same inspiration where you don't want to worship God but you want God to worship you see that where Abraham was obedient where Joshua was immediately obedient and says they worshiped Cain the opposite of worship was disobedient the opposite of reverent he reviled God and not only that he said if you won't accept what I want to give you I'll kill your son the one you respect I'll kill him see how you like that and we need to watch ourselves and see how am I coming to worship daily do we get angry when the Lord doesn't take what we're what we're offering him like we feel this should be good enough don't you see I'm trying are you taking the formula he gave you are you looking into the word and saying what you're doing does it qualify as worship or you just like Cain bringing the best fruits of your labor God doesn't need the fruits of your labor he wants his fruits to manifest in you see that's the difference Cain wanted to be exalted for the work of his hand and for the fruits that he presented he said aha look at these fruits they are the most beautiful fruits anyone has ever seen and he offered it to God thinking God would be impressed and and God said Cain I gave you and all those fruits life I had an image and picture of what they would look like in the peak of their life before they were even a seed in the ground and you want me to be impressed by that about the time you think you're doing you did something really great for God and he should be impressed by it know that he just expected that of you that was the minimum you could do well being here on this Earth while being a living being you don't get no trophies and Rewards or plaques or ribbons for reasonable service he said Cain when I sent your mom and your dad out of the garden I told them they would be tillers of the soil so far that's all you've done and the only reason you're tilling the soil is so you can put food in your own mouth so all I can see is that you've gone out and you've done for yourself and nobody else and now your pride and your arrogance you feel like this should be something I should honor and respect he said ain't no way there's another example of this in the scripture what time are we at oh my goodness okay I'm going to read quickly and then we'll hit the highlights and we'll try not to hold you along here because it's already late Samuel first Samuel 15 it's 10-31 I'm going to read very quickly and only stop in the points that we we want to really touch on then came the word of the Lord under Samuel saying it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he has turned back from following me and hath not performed my Commandments he hasn't been obedient and it Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night see that's another Mark of a man who truly knows how to worship when he hears about someone else falling off into Disobedience he doesn't rejoice he doesn't get excited it burdens his heart Samuel cried all night he said I love that boy he said Lord isn't there something we can do isn't there some way we can bring him back into the fold maybe it wasn't as egregious as you're making it out to be is there any way for him to be saved and sorrow he is here he is all night and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and behold he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be thou of the Lord very religious the most religious I have performed the Commandment of the Lord he's not even ashamed as far as he's concerned in his own heart and sing it his way the fruits he's presenting are the best God should be thankful for this Samuel should be proud he's looking for an attaboy Saul way to go I know the Lord said destroy everything but you made the right choice God's going to be be thankful for this and Samuel said what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep and mine ears and the lowing of The Oxen which I hear and Saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyed then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on now he knows it's getting serious something's wrong Samuel you're being a little bit weird you're supposed to be happy and rejoicing with us about now Samuel is not rejoicing Samuel does not look happy and Samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight you see it's that same spirit all the way back from the beginning when Lucifer fell from heaven and that was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes was not Lucifer made the the Archangel of Heaven wasn't he made the one to shine Above All Else wasn't he the one who was God's favorite wasn't he the one who was the light bringer fell from that and here we see it repeating over and over again when they fall out of worship they fall out of obedience or when they fall out of obedience they fall out of worship you can't have one without the other that was made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord same as Cain but did us fly upon the spoil and did his evil in the sight of the Lord and Saul said unto Samuel gay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and had brought a gag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites he's still in denial he's still trying to feed the same story like you ever caught somebody in a lie and you know it's a lie and you've given them evidence that it's a lie and they still keep trying to yeah but no but it really it did happen this way you're like I have proof I have proof I have you on video doing such and such it's very clearly you they're like well I don't know that's kind of a grainy doesn't really look like me I really that's not exactly what I was doing this is Saul this the prophet of God The Seer the one who God reveals things to is telling him you did not obey God and so I was going yeah no I obeyed him fully I did everything the Lord asked of me so at the time I was like I gave you the message I gave you the message but the people now he's now he's going to do what we all do when we get caught but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilgal you see now he went from us we I when he thought he was done the right thing to the people Adam did the same thing when he got caught the wife you gave me the minute he realized oh yep you got me now who who can we pass the buck to you know I I saw this clipping this little clipping one time and it it's two people talking they said it how big a problem is too big or no no problem is too big to not blame on somebody else and that's how most people run their life is if I get caught in too big a problem who can I pass this off on and take instead of taking personal responsibility you see this was the difference between Saul and David it wasn't that one committed any less um wrongs than the other I haven't done the count but it's possible we do the count on David he may have more wrongs attributed to his name than Saul but what made him a man after God's Own Heart was a minute he was called out on his sin he said Lord forgive me a sinner and he could enter into worship because he could enter back into obedience to the word you say he could recognize I have done wrong Lord I ask for your forgiveness but whatever the price and the cost I'm willing to pay it he didn't turn and blame it on nobody else he said yeah you're right I did that Lord forgive me Saul hmm no repentance no personal responsibility and Samuel said half the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord now this is even where I took in in thinking about worship and how we associate worship most of the time with the singing of songs with prayer with all these different things that we would associate with a worship service but here in the Old Testament we find out that these things performed under the wrong inspiration or not worship but obedience is always accepted as worship behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as the iniquity as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he is also rejected thee from being King you see Saul's disobedience was a direct challenge to God's Authority even though maybe he didn't see it that way but he said God I have a better idea than you and you should just accept it just like Cain my fruits were the right sacrifice to begin with you should just accept my worship you should reverence what I am doing for you it's not I who need to reverence you and once you have challenged God's Authority like Saul or Kane nothing you do after that is worship from this point on it uses the word in the scripture but Saul never actually worshiped again because he stayed in that state of disobedience now he made a pretense of religion and worshiped on a religious basis but he never entered into true worship in spirit and in truth that was it at that point in fact he even prophesied later there was a time when he came amongst the sons of the prophets he was looking to slay David so he's chasing God's anointed to kill him but he enters up in a service where the power of God is coming down the anointing is in the room and gifts and callings without repentance Saul prophesies he didn't worship because he was in disobedience and unrepented and so all said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice now therefore I pray thee parted my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto the Saul I will not return with thee you see Samuel had discernment he realizes Saul isn't serious about worshiping the Lord Sauls at this point realizes that Samuel has great influence with the people and if Samuel walks away from him after rebuking him with no reconciliation he's going to lose face he didn't fall on his face and begin to worship and say Lord forgive me and then give out Commandments you know kill a gag and let's put all these sheep and all these oxen to the sword God doesn't want them we messed up but let's do what we can to clean up this mess not once he wasn't serious about asking for forgiveness he simply realized oh I'm in a bad spot politically now this is not good for my ongoing political movement as king here if Samuel turns against me what if all the people turn against me and I lose my power he said that can't happen I have to feign worship and get Samuel to come alongside me so that people realize that well I'm still on good terms with Samuel Saul wasn't worried about being on terms with the Lord Samuel that's we want to be on good terms with and Samuel said on the Saul I will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord hath rejected thee from being King over Israel and as Samuel turned about to go away he laid a hold of upon the skirt of his mantle and rent it no respect no respect for the King's Men the vassal God had sent to him zero and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than now and also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent then he said I have sinned I have sinned yet she he said I have sinned I admit it I'm a sinner yet he didn't say what can I do what will the Lord ask of me that I can be set free of this that I can ask forgiveness of the Lord I I've sinned yet honor me now I pray thee you didn't say how can I be honored of the Lord he said Samuel you you're the face of God to the people honor me now I pray thee before the Elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord thy God see he's lost all relationship with God at this point he is so far away from worship that he no longer has that relationship he's broken everything God's not speaking to him he's not speaking to God he's putting on a pretense he's still got a really good religious game no one better than Saul he'll he'll still build the Altar and bring the fattest of The Oxen and the Rams and and and make sacrifices but not a one of them mean a thing anymore they don't mean anything to him and God isn't even looking at it now at this point that offering has become a stench in God's nostrils because it's not coming from the heart of a worshiper see God's not looking for your sacrifice he's looking for true worshipers who are willing to come with obedience and when you come with obedience and the sacrifice is a product of that obedience God accepts it but if you try to present sacrifices forcing God to accept you without coming and recognizing him as the as a supernatural power the Divine being Lord of lords and King of Kings then he doesn't want to even look at it he doesn't want anything to do with it because this is not something that can be bought and sold no we're going to jump forward one more time in the scripture in Matthew 15 1-9 then came Jesus to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying now we're TR think about it we're tracking the spirits through the scripture because they run parallel through the scripture the whole way the spirit of the worshiper and the spirit of Cain okay then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the traditions of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered it and said unto them why do ye also transgress the Commandment of God by your traditions you see the altar was now filled with the fruits of men's traditions and religion and they were so stuck in their ways here they were approaching Jesus God himself in the flesh and saying how dare you and your disciples just honor the fruits of our hand that we present to God what do you have to say about that and he had an instant rebuke why do ye also transgress the Commandment of God by your traditions why are you disobedient to the Commandments God gave you directly by these fruits you're trying to present Cain that's why when he spoke to them and he said that they were of their father the devil when he asked and when he when he put in and suggested that they might be bastard-born they immediately they knew what he was talking about they knew the story from the beginning they said well that's not us we're born of Abraham that's right they didn't realize it was not a carnal seed that he was talking about but it was that same bastardization of the word of God from the very beginning he said and I can see it in you said you're not worshipers not a one of you you parade around here and act like you're so holy he said I'm going to tell you exactly what you are for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curses father and mother let him die to death but ye say whoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition so they started putting Clauses in effect to God's word if it benefited them they said well God doesn't really mean that like if you're really successful and you give large offerings to the church God will let you slide on a lot of things don't worry about it you don't have to work be a worshiper just keep bringing the money as long as you do that we'll we'll honor you we'll make you a big man around here and not only that we will tell you that God loves you for that too because they were they so believed their own lie they propagated it to everyone else that's why Jesus said the blind leaders of the line and they'll both fall in the ditch ye Hypocrites well did it says prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men I want to draw a parallel here or bring something together the woman at the well Jesus told her ye know not what you worship because you're a Samaritan he said but the Jews they know who they worship and then he turns on to the Jews and he says you know who you worship but you Worship in vain because you're not worshiping because you're in direct Disobedience to the word of God you have no excuse the Samaritan has an excuse they don't have the word they don't have this that the Jews had they don't know who they worship they just worship they feel that draw to worship God drawing on them that same thing that was placed in the heart of every man and woman and they're looking to worship but you the Jews the most religious people of all time you know who to worship and you should know how to worship like Cain I spelled out how to worship very specifically when I sent you Moses and you have perverted that word over and over again to such an extent that you believe you're worshiping while living completely in sin and the message Hebrews chapter 5 well do I shake jump do it you you don't won't have to do nothing you've already done it God brought you from death unto life you're alive then your fruits of your life show it lots of you Methodist Nazarene shouted as hard as you could shouts and steal corn out of a man's patch that's right do everything that could be a lot of you Pentecostals spoke in tongues like pouring Peas on a cowhide sure went right out and run away with the next man's wife done all kinds of things that's not it brother many of people you know they say well they look at this and he's like random didn't say nothing about message people there wasn't any message people back then there was no one who said I believe the message there was his little church but most of them still identified under the places and that they'd come out of his brother random was here today he would have a Stern rebuke and so would Christ for what the people who claim to believe this message have done with it how they have abused the people just like the scribes and Pharisees how they become wolves in sheep's clothing how it's just become a religion that wasn't to be so don't try to have any sensation or anything to take the place of the Holy Spirit when the new birth is come you are changed you don't have to do anything to prove it your life proves it you say well I'm a worshiper look at me I'm a worshiper that was Saul he wanted to prove to everyone I'm a worshiper come on Samuel let's go make some sacrifices together look at me look at the church I go to look at who my pastor is none of those things matter look how much I give to the church look how much I volunteer none of those things matter they're all sacrifices you have an altar that you present them on but if you're not in obedience to the word none of it's a worship you don't have to do anything to prove it your life proves it as you walk your love peace long you see here they are here are the fruits that God was looking for not Cain's fruits love peace long-suffering gentleness meekness patience that's what you are the whole world sees the reflection of Jesus Christ in you it becomes a public Proclamation you won't have to tell people don't know if you're a worshiper you'll take that presence with you everywhere you go because when you're a worshiper the reverence you give him doesn't change on your location whether you're in the church building you're outside you're at work you're walking down the street you're always in that state of worship you're always in that state of reverence you're always in that state when when all of a sudden his presence can just come by and because you're a worshiper it'll have an effect on you and you'll fall into that awe he'll just have that feeling and the tears will start to stream down your face because you really are in all of his presence you don't know what to say all you know to do is be in awe like there it's Solomon's Temple you can imagine standing there ministers could not worship because of the presence of God the worshipers under that presence just worshiped they give reverence to God it wasn't any more about the new Temple it was about the presence that filled it you see because Solomon's whole prayer was all about bringing the presence of God down Solomon didn't pray and and talk in his prayer talk about the temple and how thank you Lord for making me such a great king that I could do such a great work so Solomon's Prayer was all about giving honor and glory and worship to God and thanking him for all he had done including the building of the Temple that also was a work of God it wasn't a work of man's hand like Nebuchadnezzar claimed of of his kingdom she could the worshiper will always attribute everything back to God now speaking in tongues and shouting in there that's just an attribute that follows this kind of a life and you can take and impersonate those attributes and never have that life you can be religious your whole life you can look squeaky clean to everybody you can walk around and everyone will be like wow I want to be like that brother that sister or man if I could only live the life they live but only you and God know that that's a facade or if you're a worshiper that's what he said of the scribes and the Pharisees he said on the outside you're whitewashed on the outside you look perfect on the outside but on the inside you're like like the grave that you are you're full of dead men's bones there's nothing but death inside of you and without a revelation even the disciples were quite shocked by that because he when he told him unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees said you don't even have a chance and they went oh my goodness if I have to be more righteous than them who who has a chance but they didn't realize that scribes and Pharisees they weren't righteous at all they had their own righteousness their own filthy rags they put on but not his righteousness because they weren't worshipers Maya you see it all around you so there's nothing you can say is the evidence of the Holy Ghost unless it's your life that you live now if you want to speak with tongues that's perfectly all right if you live the life to back it up that's right if you want to shout fine that's good I shout too get so happy sometimes I can't hardly wear a pair of shoes I'm like to jump out of them and that's wonderful I believe it you see your life you know there's there's something that people always quote in the message and I can remember it from the time I was a little kid or what what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and they said well the prophet said that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is if you can say Amen to every word of God and you know what that turned out a whole bunch of religious people who can't sit quiet and listen to a message to hear what God's saying to them because they want to be the first one to jump up and say amen and amen and amen and I'm not saying that don't get me wrong there's a Time to Say Amen absolutely if you were in the word and what is coming across that Pulpit or if you could be talking to someone doesn't have to be in church and they say something that strikes your heart you say Amen so be it that's the truth that's the time to say Amen but do you know what you're saying Amen to you are you a worshiper is that amen something God is even respecting or you just running and jumping are you is like Saul Saul Saul was Amen Corner the whole time Samuel was there because he wanted to be seen by the people wow look at Saul he must really be getting it he's on fire look at that guy he can't hardly stay in his seat dead as can be inside because he wasn't a worshiper none of it meant anything he heard the words they went in one ear and out the other and then he went off and kept doing his own thing he probably went right back to sacrificing all them sheep and oxen that God told him he didn't want right back to it like like Samuel hadn't said a word Kane he went right on with life after killing Abel he wasn't even thought he wasn't sorry about it a bit in fact he told God you got to do something now because now that I killed Cain everyone's going to want to kill me you would think well God must be going to strike him dead not only did he not worship correctly he didn't take God's advice he's disrespected God to the max God says no I'll put a mark on you cane that you'll be protected nobody will kill you so don't be surprised you see someone you're like wow how could they be doing that how could they be living that way and they seem to just get away with it all they're not there's a great white Throne waiting for him all they have is this life offered to them and after that it's over that's the end see in in the matter of time God wasn't in a hurry he said I knew you were going to do that before you did it Cain and he said there's even this has a purpose I allowed you to be born for a purpose he said because that serpent seed had to be sown and had to continue on because it's all a part of my great plan and Cain thought wow I totally got away with this I snubbed God and not only that I'm pretty sure God respects me for it because look at even he won't touch me he had no revelation no understanding nothing that's the point place that Satan is still at today he still thinks that even though he has seen God Work Through the Ages everything God has ever said has come true he still thinks that there's a ho a chance for him to win he really believes it he really believes that there's still a possibility that I can pull this off he hasn't given up because he doesn't Revere God and he has no plans on ever obeying him but the worshiper the worshiper takes God at his word and said Lord not my will but thy will be done you see the true worshiper like Abraham like David like Mary you see Mary was a true worshiper is that when the angel came to her she said be it according to Thy Word no questions no nothing and you know how everyone could tell she was a true worshiper is that word had an effect on her life for the rest of her life she was changed that was it she couldn't deny it it was a public Proclamation and she was shamed for it she had to bear that reproach and it hasn't changed for the worshipers of God is that he'll ask you to bear that reproach and see your reaction if your reaction is no no that's too much for me if you don't like what I've already given you too bad it says okay that's up to you but when your response is Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word he said that that is a man that is a woman after my own heart that is a true worshiper they have entered in to worshiping in spirit and in truth that's when you achieve that now you're a worshiper John 14 15 with closing if the musicians would like to come if you love me keep my Commandments or I would say if you adore if you worship me keep my Commandments worship it's so much more and so much greater than what we ever thought worship is True Fellowship with the father not sometimes not just in church not just when life is good see Abraham when he worshiped it was at a pivotal point where the worst thing he could ever imagine was about to happen job we didn't read it but go back read it there's a point where it says and job fell down and worshiped do you know what time that was [Music] that wasn't when all was going well that wasn't when wasn't even at the end of the story when everything had been restored you know when job worshiped when God had allowed Satan to take and strip everything from him his wealth his power his authority his influence everything his entire identity as a prince amongst men was stripped from him his children dead when at the end of all those things happening it says and job fell down and he worshiped he said Lord though you slay me yet will I trust you he said I worship you I reverence you there's none like you there's none greater than you and no matter what you put me through I won't I'll still obey you I'll still follow you because I'm a worshiper of the almighty God Saints [Music] my cry my call to you tonight join with me in returning back to worship not just the singing of songs and the prayers and those are all good things those are all a part of worship those are the sacrifices we bring that God is so pleased with when the worshiper brings them but let's enter back into that obedience into the moving of the Holy Spirit let's enter back into that state where we worship in spirit and in truth it's not just a thing we say but the life lived let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just ask that you would have your way this evening or with these few words that have been spoken father Lord that Lord if even one word was a blessing to someone to someone's heart Lord that you would just have your way with that father Lord I just ask you bless your people for Lord being in this service and listening father giving their attention father I mean you bless them for that father Lord may you just strengthen them and give them what they need a father to carry on through the rest of this week and then fly father Lord may

you sweet Jesus be it all to be I believe that's what the Lord is calling us so amen Jesus said it the father seeketh such to worship him when he sent Moses he was seeking people to worship Him in spirit and in truth now you have to realize that is where our truth representation is he wants to get us back to that place foreign was in Eden before the fall all he did was just worship when we get back to them to back to to Eden all we would do is just worship when Adam named the animals he was worshiping God that's why God was pleased with it that's where our truth representation is is to worship God father seek as such that's what he's calling us to that's why he's drawing us to that's why the son of man Ministry has come to bring us to bring us to a life of Truth worship that answer will be yes [Applause] I say yes Lord yes to your will and to your will I say yes Lord yes I will be when you're Spirit speaks to me without [Music] my angry and answer will be yes again praise the

just just keep uh keep our brother in your prayer as you as you prayed alone amen the father Secrets us to worship amen praise the Lord let's realize that worship is more than our singing more than our praise is singing In Praise it's just that the little part of faith is the life that we live every day amen I love that I love that the Holy Spirit make uh Genesis 22 the first time that that the word worship was used [Music] Abraham going to worship giving God the best giving God all that he have waited for all that he just just surrounded accepting that God will take his own son what a worship a lot of worship foreign [Music] worship is the feminine part of God you have to know that he make man male and female when he put the whole earth to sleep and he and he went into that dark room to bring out a bride to bring out a a female expression of himself so worship is always in that place where we get so intimate with God sometimes through worship come out of us when the robber meets the road in the time of our trial in the time of of of of when the Lord is really dealing with us sometimes that's when true worship because it comes from your soul you say yes Lord I surrounded
