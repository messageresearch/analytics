[40:35] praise be to god praise the lord
[40:39] i thank the almighty god
[40:42] for his goodness i'm going to be very
[40:44] snappy
[40:45] one thing i was never good at in english
[40:48] was english summary
[40:52] any time i was giving maybe a paragraph
[40:54] to summarize by the time i finished i
[40:56] got two paragraphs
[40:58] so rather one
[41:01] i will summarize it
[41:04] yes
[41:06] um i have a testimony to give
[41:09] and uh before then
[41:13] let me just take part of my time
[41:17] i don't know how much time i have to
[41:18] praise be to god
[41:20] that once upon a time there were two
[41:22] nations that were fighting
[41:26] and then
[41:27] each time one side would go and gather
[41:30] their dead
[41:31] and they had two cemeteries where they
[41:34] buried them
[41:35] and they buried some
[41:38] in the grave of the brief and some in
[41:41] the grave of the cowards
[41:44] so and every year they celebrated those
[41:47] that were buried in the grave
[41:50] in the cemetery belonging to the brave
[41:53] so somebody asked
[41:55] why they were doing that and that they
[41:56] were not being fair how did they know
[41:59] that these ones were brave and these
[42:00] ones were cowards then the king said
[42:04] they always look at the wound
[42:07] and
[42:09] wherever the bullet enters the body they
[42:11] could tell and they will also tell why
[42:13] the bullet exits the body
[42:16] so if the bullet entered through the
[42:18] chest or maybe through the front view
[42:20] they could tell that means the fellow
[42:22] was fighting
[42:24] was fighting the enemy
[42:26] but if the bullet
[42:28] pierced the person from behind that
[42:30] means the fellow was running away
[42:32] from the heat of the moment
[42:35] so the young man suggested if that was
[42:37] the case
[42:38] when the enemies cross the bridge i mean
[42:40] when their troops cross the bridge
[42:42] they should blow the bridge up
[42:45] and that saved the day
[42:49] and what i want to say as we are
[42:50] crossing into the new year
[42:53] let's bend down every single bridge
[42:56] there race in our lives
[42:58] because when the bridges are there there
[43:00] is no life of commitment with christ
[43:03] because you are there fighting and you
[43:05] have it at the back of your mind that if
[43:07] things do not go on well
[43:09] you are going to back out
[43:10] but when you know that the bridges are
[43:12] broken
[43:13] you are there to stay praise be to god
[43:16] brother one who still have time
[43:18] [Applause]
[43:21] two minutes
[43:22] praise be to god

[44:28] one month
[44:30] and that he should flee
[44:33] and he was there on contract for a month
[44:37] so every morning the guy would come and
[44:39] sit with him till it generated some
[44:41] concern
[44:42] and those who hired him came and asked
[44:44] him but what is this guy to you
[44:46] he said that is my uncle
[44:49] and one day he was lying in the room and
[44:51] they came and opened the door

[44:55] he wasn't sleeping in the night anymore
[44:57] they opened the door he was wide awake
[44:58] looking at them they said oh you're not
[45:00] sleeping he said i'm not sleeping
[45:01] and then they went and never came back
[45:03] the following day he left all his things
[45:06] and then he ran away from that place
[45:08] about 500 miles away
[45:11] that was why he he got and they bought
[45:13] him new clothes
[45:15] and i just want to give god the glory
[45:18] for saving his life

[1:17:57] it is a spirit

[1:25:05] praise the lord
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:09] and uh
[1:25:16] the the prophet
[1:25:18] amos said in amos chapter 3
[1:25:23] that there is no evil

[1:25:29] praise the lord
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:32] there is no evil
[1:25:34] that can happen in the city and there is
[1:25:36] nothing
[1:25:37] that can happen to us
[1:25:39] until the lord allow it
[1:25:41] praise the lord
[1:25:43] amen
[1:25:44] so i mean just just that chorus alone
[1:25:48] you already have a thought
[1:25:50] of what we'll be talking on tonight
[1:25:53] and
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:55] i mean the lord has allowed many of the
[1:25:58] things that have come around our life
[1:26:00] almost all of the things that have come
[1:26:02] around our life there is nothing that
[1:26:03] take god by surprise amen
[1:26:06] praise the lord and uh but tonight i
[1:26:10] just i just want to
[1:26:12] uh
[1:26:13] i just want to
[1:26:15] be able to grab your attention a little
[1:26:17] bit like i said not not so much of a
[1:26:19] preaching but just to be able to share
[1:26:22] some things with you
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:26] we're coming to the end of
[1:26:28] 2020 which of course we never thought
[1:26:31] that rapture would have waited till 2020
[1:26:34] we thought that we would have been gone
[1:26:36] home to be with the lord
[1:26:38] uh where the lion laid by the lamb like
[1:26:40] the little kids were singing amen
[1:26:42] praise the lord
[1:26:44] and uh and we hope that's what 20 21 is
[1:26:46] bringing for us we hope amen praise the
[1:26:49] lord praise the lord if not we will
[1:26:52] still keep serving the lord amen
[1:26:54] every day that's if he's coming the next
[1:26:57] day
[1:26:58] and we will keep
[1:26:59] living as if he's coming a hundred years
[1:27:01] amen praise the lord but it's uh uh i
[1:27:05] mean uh as you as we want to look at
[1:27:08] this talk tonight
[1:27:10] i was thinking about it
[1:27:12] for a while
[1:27:13] and uh
[1:27:15] saying lord you i mean you got to help
[1:27:16] me here to to be able to bring this in
[1:27:19] in the short period of time that we have
[1:27:21] uh uh tell it for the five minutes so we
[1:27:24] can be able to change the order of the
[1:27:25] service so
[1:27:27] and uh uh
[1:27:31] but you look at what the prophet as i
[1:27:33] said and where i want to go to tonight i
[1:27:36] want to talk to us as as the children of
[1:27:39] god i want to talk to us as people that
[1:27:42] has been following a vedicated message
[1:27:45] now like i said this subject was used
[1:27:49] uh a scripture was used to preach the
[1:27:52] message recognized in your day
[1:27:54] and its message
[1:27:56] and as i was as i was studying the
[1:27:58] scripture
[1:27:59] and thinking about the message that
[1:28:02] brother branham preached using this
[1:28:04] message
[1:28:05] a question came to my mind
[1:28:07] and if we we talk about
[1:28:10] uh the message of our day many of us we
[1:28:13] will you know lift our hands and thank
[1:28:15] god for the message i mean we have
[1:28:16] recognized you know that god has sent us
[1:28:19] a message of our day we have been able
[1:28:21] to recognize the messenger
[1:28:23] but did we recognize what the message
[1:28:26] will do
[1:28:31] is uh
[1:28:32] they are different things
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:35] the messenger and the message
[1:28:38] you know uh the messenger is not the
[1:28:40] message the messenger is the one that
[1:28:43] brings the message
[1:28:45] praise the lord
[1:28:47] the messenger is not the message he is
[1:28:49] the one that brings the message
[1:28:52] and the message is brought for a purpose
[1:28:56] praise the lord
[1:28:58] the message is brought for a purpose so
[1:29:00] when when we when we have the grace to
[1:29:03] be able to recognize that we are living
[1:29:06] in the day that we find ourselves living
[1:29:08] in that we identify by the scripture as
[1:29:11] the laodicea church age and and and we
[1:29:14] and and we have been able to to to
[1:29:16] recognize in the scripture that god
[1:29:18] promised a messenger a message for this
[1:29:21] day we have seen the message i mean
[1:29:24] recognize the message recognize the
[1:29:26] messenger and but there is another thing
[1:29:29] also the message has a purpose
[1:29:34] praise the lord the message has a
[1:29:37] purpose and when we miss that purpose no
[1:29:40] matter if you have recognized the
[1:29:42] messenger or you have heard the message
[1:29:45] if you miss the purpose of the message
[1:29:47] you you miss the important part
[1:29:52] praise the lord
[1:29:54] you miss the important part
[1:29:59] and a little bit of that that's what we
[1:30:00] want to talk about tonight
[1:30:03] i will read from recognizing your data
[1:30:05] and this message
[1:30:06] trying to keep my time here
[1:30:09] now auzier said in
[1:30:11] in chapter 6 verse 1 return to the lord
[1:30:16] remember
[1:30:18] praise the lord
[1:30:22] but if they are not
[1:30:24] uh if they are not personally with me i
[1:30:27] didn't send it
[1:30:30] i think so
[1:30:34] okay
[1:30:36] i just have uh
[1:30:41] it's just afraid if you don't have it
[1:30:42] there then wish me i didn't send it i
[1:30:44] think i just sent it there okay and all
[1:30:46] oziah said in hozier chapter 6 verse 1
[1:30:51] return to the lord
[1:30:53] remember
[1:30:54] he said that
[1:30:56] they
[1:30:57] will be scattered
[1:31:00] and the way
[1:31:03] are we together
[1:31:06] he said they will return
[1:31:09] to the lord after
[1:31:12] he did
[1:31:13] being after the dead being scattered
[1:31:17] and he will bound them up
[1:31:21] return
[1:31:22] be scattered second and and and they
[1:31:25] were torn
[1:31:27] and
[1:31:28] was blinded
[1:31:30] that's just exactly what happened
[1:31:35] he will hear us and he will bind us up
[1:31:39] like
[1:31:40] ezekiel chapter 37
[1:31:43] the dry bones
[1:31:45] in the valley for the bones ezekiel said
[1:31:48] ezekiel saw it
[1:31:49] they returned again
[1:31:51] and noticed hozier said after two days
[1:31:56] after two days he will return to them
[1:32:00] and he will
[1:32:02] he will receive us
[1:32:05] and he will give us he will revive us
[1:32:08] now
[1:32:09] revive dozen means resurrection
[1:32:12] re revive
[1:32:15] there is a same word used otherwise
[1:32:18] look i mean look it up it means revival
[1:32:22] he will revive us after two days
[1:32:25] now so years said ozier is is giving the
[1:32:29] prophecy about israel being scattered
[1:32:32] the very people that god called through
[1:32:36] our father abraham and he he gave them a
[1:32:38] coveting amen
[1:32:40] praise the lord and and
[1:32:42] uh and then after 400 years we know the
[1:32:45] story he came down and when they went
[1:32:48] out by jealousy they went into egypt
[1:32:52] from joseph and then they were enslaved
[1:32:55] there and god
[1:32:57] came down
[1:32:59] through moses and brought them out
[1:33:02] and uh and took them over to the
[1:33:05] promised land promised them a lane
[1:33:08] flooring with milk and honey
[1:33:10] but he also told them that they will
[1:33:13] have to fight
[1:33:15] for every inch of ground
[1:33:18] to be able to enjoy
[1:33:20] that milk and honey they will have to
[1:33:24] fight
[1:33:25] it is for them
[1:33:27] praise the lord but yet
[1:33:29] god will need a little a little effort
[1:33:33] of them
[1:33:34] a little bit of consciousness
[1:33:37] a little sense of appreciation
[1:33:40] praise the lord then we have to fight
[1:33:43] for every inch of ground and he also
[1:33:45] told them you know
[1:33:47] i mean if you if you uh uh
[1:33:51] if you neglect this promise this will
[1:33:53] happen to you if you if you i mean if
[1:33:56] you compromise with the people in the
[1:33:57] land this will happen to you and he you
[1:34:00] know he told them out of there praise
[1:34:01] the lord
[1:34:02] now but he's the one that called him
[1:34:06] he's he's the one that called these
[1:34:08] people his people
[1:34:11] praise the lord
[1:34:12] just like he's the one that caught us
[1:34:15] amen we are sheep of the pastors amen
[1:34:19] he is our god and we are his people
[1:34:22] praise the lord
[1:34:23] now
[1:34:24] but to realize here that god
[1:34:28] is so beautiful i mean i can i can just
[1:34:31] i can just repeat exactly what brother
[1:34:34] dick said last weekend to realize here
[1:34:36] that god in the back part of his mind
[1:34:40] had this great plan and the things that
[1:34:43] he would do
[1:34:45] for his people the things that he would
[1:34:48] do to his people
[1:34:50] for his namesake
[1:34:53] praise the lord now you think about it
[1:34:56] like this the bible says
[1:34:58] in the beginning god made man in his
[1:35:00] image male and female created him damn
[1:35:03] genesis 1 26
[1:35:05] but genesis 2
[1:35:07] 7
[1:35:08] the bible says and god talk of the dust
[1:35:10] of the earth now kind of a picture in
[1:35:13] your mind
[1:35:14] uh the very same thing that jesus did to
[1:35:16] that blind man he spit
[1:35:19] in the morn
[1:35:21] praise the lord he never talked
[1:35:24] went to the river and took water he
[1:35:26] spayed praise the lord
[1:35:29] this whole reason why we wearing max
[1:35:31] tonight is because of spain
[1:35:33] you know
[1:35:36] and the whole reason why we wearing max
[1:35:38] tonight
[1:35:38] and i appreciate you doing that
[1:35:41] praise the lord
[1:35:42] amen
[1:35:44] so uh
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:50] he spit in the mud
[1:35:53] and
[1:35:54] i mean
[1:35:55] not in the father
[1:35:58] that have gone through process
[1:36:02] he spit in the dirt of the earth
[1:36:06] praise the lord
[1:36:08] and and and and
[1:36:10] play with it with his fingers
[1:36:15] he had to mix it
[1:36:17] he was not using spoon he was using his
[1:36:19] fingers
[1:36:21] he played with it
[1:36:23] playing with his spirit in the mouth
[1:36:28] just to be able to give a man a sight
[1:36:33] now so you think about it genesis
[1:36:35] chapter
[1:36:36] 2 7
[1:36:37] god
[1:36:38] in the dust of the earth
[1:36:42] to be able to form us
[1:36:45] he was plain in the dust of the earth
[1:36:52] roll in the dust together
[1:36:54] make an arm
[1:36:58] praise the lord
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:03] if he used pain i would think maybe he
[1:37:05] used pedigree to make us
[1:37:09] i mean
[1:37:10] he's painting the dust
[1:37:12] put a little bit of eye
[1:37:16] nose
[1:37:19] put on his fingers let me make it good
[1:37:25] praise the lord
[1:37:28] amen
[1:37:32] and he went through all of that
[1:37:35] to be able to give us a form
[1:37:39] praise the lord
[1:37:40] we can have form and shape
[1:37:44] that uh
[1:37:45] sometimes we get so proud of
[1:37:49] but he went through all of that
[1:37:54] praise the lord
[1:37:56] and yet
[1:37:58] we can appreciate
[1:38:00] the way we look
[1:38:02] amen
[1:38:03] we can appreciate our height we can
[1:38:05] appreciate i mean all of the things he
[1:38:07] have given us i mean fingers and and
[1:38:10] everything he had given us
[1:38:13] but
[1:38:14] he went through a process
[1:38:18] he went through a process for a purpose
[1:38:25] are we together
[1:38:27] and the very the very way he went
[1:38:30] through a process
[1:38:31] to be able to give us form and shape
[1:38:35] that is the very way the very same way
[1:38:39] in the back part of his mind he has lay
[1:38:42] out a process
[1:38:44] to be able to give his children all of
[1:38:48] his children
[1:38:51] all of his children
[1:38:53] that's the reason why paul says if you
[1:38:56] cannot be tried if you cannot be broken
[1:39:00] if you cannot be burned if you cannot be
[1:39:02] torn apart you are not god's child
[1:39:06] because he does that to all of his
[1:39:09] children
[1:39:10] that is the only way he has
[1:39:13] to give us
[1:39:14] form and shape
[1:39:20] are we together
[1:39:24] he
[1:39:25] they have torn us
[1:39:28] i wonder how many times as he was making
[1:39:31] man shaped in the dust of the earth he
[1:39:33] said no it's not good
[1:39:35] i don't like this
[1:39:36] i got to do it better
[1:39:40] amen
[1:39:41] he fix it he don't like it
[1:39:45] he tear it apart
[1:39:47] he put it back together again
[1:39:50] at the end he says it's good
[1:39:55] praise the lord
[1:39:57] amen
[1:39:58] he they have torn us
[1:40:03] and here he's saying
[1:40:05] just like israel
[1:40:07] we all know the tender hand of jehovah
[1:40:11] some of the things that god had to bring
[1:40:13] his people through
[1:40:15] his people a people that he called by
[1:40:18] his name
[1:40:20] took them down into to egypt never make
[1:40:23] them princes
[1:40:25] they became slaves
[1:40:30] praise the lord they became slaves
[1:40:33] they were whipped day and night but they
[1:40:36] were god's people
[1:40:40] they were god's people
[1:40:45] amen
[1:40:46] he was tearing them
[1:40:48] to bind them up in the promised lane
[1:40:54] are we together
[1:40:55] he that have torn us
[1:40:59] i'm going to go straight to the point
[1:41:00] tonight
[1:41:02] i'm just trying to to capture your mind
[1:41:06] and we all know about the holocaust
[1:41:08] the only reason why the only reason why
[1:41:12] they had to go through that is because
[1:41:13] they were jews
[1:41:18] the lord
[1:41:19] and all of those things
[1:41:21] but
[1:41:22] we're coming home because we realize
[1:41:24] that
[1:41:25] uh you know as the evening shadow is
[1:41:28] falling
[1:41:29] uh it's little than we think
[1:41:33] and even in our own cycle
[1:41:37] we have seen
[1:41:38] different things that have happened
[1:41:41] praise the lord
[1:41:43] amen
[1:41:44] just like how it was for israel that's
[1:41:47] the same way it has been
[1:41:50] for all of god's people
[1:41:53] we have gone through difficult times in
[1:41:55] our lives
[1:41:58] praise the lord
[1:42:00] and most especially
[1:42:02] on the altar
[1:42:04] of religion
[1:42:06] many families have been broken
[1:42:12] many lives has been torn apart
[1:42:16] by things people has preached
[1:42:20] we have had all forms of of of doctrine
[1:42:24] and teaching
[1:42:25] you know like like paul says in in
[1:42:27] philippians he says some has preached
[1:42:29] christ out of strife
[1:42:32] some has preached out of contention
[1:42:35] amen
[1:42:36] some has preached for personal gain
[1:42:39] we have a different form of of abuses
[1:42:45] and all of these things that have that
[1:42:47] is that is happening and all one of
[1:42:49] people are
[1:42:51] asking questions
[1:42:54] but it has always been like this
[1:42:59] it has always been like this
[1:43:02] to god's people right from the beginning
[1:43:06] praise the lord
[1:43:07] amen because that is the only way that
[1:43:10] god has to give us form and shape
[1:43:16] to bring us to the image of christ the
[1:43:18] only way he has is to pass us through
[1:43:22] these difficult times
[1:43:26] but remember
[1:43:28] he that have toned us
[1:43:30] is the only one
[1:43:32] that is able
[1:43:34] to heal us
[1:43:37] he's the only one
[1:43:39] and if god has laid his hands on your
[1:43:42] life
[1:43:44] and has been dealing with you and
[1:43:45] breaking you in different places
[1:43:48] you must realize
[1:43:50] he won't leave you like that
[1:43:54] praise the lord
[1:43:55] he will have an end product
[1:43:58] he will have a finish work
[1:44:03] praise the lord he will have a finished
[1:44:06] work
[1:44:09] because he does not start something
[1:44:12] without finishing it
[1:44:15] before he even started
[1:44:17] he has already finished it
[1:44:19] he has a finish
[1:44:20] picture in his mind
[1:44:22] praise the lord
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:28] what a comfort
[1:44:29] like isaiah said come unto the lord why
[1:44:32] should we run
[1:44:34] why should we run from church why should
[1:44:37] we run away from the message
[1:44:39] why should we run
[1:44:41] and where are we running tall
[1:44:46] praise the lord amen where are we
[1:44:49] running for
[1:44:51] like peter said who will we go to
[1:44:55] we know that you have the words of life
[1:45:02] praise the lord
[1:45:04] are we together
[1:45:06] amen
[1:45:07] maybe some some of you or some of us
[1:45:11] have really never taste
[1:45:14] the hurt that others have tasted
[1:45:19] the hurt that other have tasted
[1:45:22] just because of the name
[1:45:25] of christ amen amen
[1:45:28] praise the lord maybe you have never you
[1:45:31] have never tested that

[1:45:45] it was not because god wanted isaac
[1:45:49] the one that god wanted was abraham
[1:45:54] but for god to get abraham where he
[1:45:56] wanted abraham to be it had to cost him

[1:48:37] horrible things
[1:48:39] that you have never imagined
[1:48:41] what happened honor the message of the
[1:48:44] hour sir
[1:48:47] scary things
[1:48:53] but remember
[1:48:54] the tender hand of jehovah

[1:48:59] petey

[1:49:37] paul was quoting
[1:49:39] david in the psalm in romans chapter 8
[1:49:43] he said for your sake
[1:49:46] for the sake
[1:49:49] we have been
[1:49:50] like sheeps to the slaughter
[1:49:54] praise the lord
[1:49:58] for whosoever now for my sake
[1:50:03] now for this church sake
[1:50:05] not not for brother branham's sake
[1:50:08] for his sake for god's sake
[1:50:13] we have been like sheeps
[1:50:17] to the slaughter
[1:50:18] think about it think about it in your
[1:50:20] mind you you think about it
[1:50:22] just like bardik said ray have been a
[1:50:26] predestinated seed of god
[1:50:30] right from the mind of god
[1:50:33] amen
[1:50:35] think about
[1:50:37] even
[1:50:38] eve
[1:50:40] the first girl child
[1:50:43] from the heart of the father father
[1:50:46] one that will be called abigail
[1:50:50] because it means the love of the father
[1:50:54] and god will allow
[1:50:57] his daughter
[1:50:59] to be ravished
[1:51:02] to be torn apart
[1:51:07] praise the lord
[1:51:10] they have to be a purpose
[1:51:12] that almighty god
[1:51:14] will sit back
[1:51:16] and allow
[1:51:18] the enemy to ravage his daughter
[1:51:24] there is a purpose that god will sit
[1:51:27] back
[1:51:28] and allow you
[1:51:31] to go through what you are going through
[1:51:38] praise the lord
[1:51:41] amen
[1:51:42] there is a purpose
[1:51:46] and as long as we know
[1:51:51] everything we are going through there is
[1:51:53] a purpose there is unexpected end there
[1:51:56] is a finished product
[1:52:06] so just like we read there from matthew
[1:52:08] chapter 14 and losing my time here
[1:52:12] and i really not i started preaching yet
[1:52:18] we know the story
[1:52:20] jesus came out of a revival
[1:52:23] and he told the disciples to go on he
[1:52:25] was going to get himself a little rest
[1:52:28] decided to stay over the mountain and
[1:52:30] prayed a little bit
[1:52:31] amen
[1:52:35] and the bible says the fourth hour of
[1:52:37] the night
[1:52:40] praise the lord
[1:52:43] well he just decided to take a walk i'll
[1:52:45] go and meet him
[1:52:49] and until be until
[1:52:52] he put
[1:52:53] his leg on the sea
[1:52:56] it was all calm that night
[1:53:00] but when he took the first step
[1:53:04] when he touched the water
[1:53:07] praise the lord
[1:53:09] everything started going out of order
[1:53:13] praise the lord everything
[1:53:16] everything started going out of order
[1:53:19] that's what brother branham says your
[1:53:21] battle begins when you i mean when you
[1:53:22] give your heart to the lord when you get
[1:53:24] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:53:26] christ and identify with christ i mean
[1:53:28] that's when your war starts
[1:53:31] because you have taken on his name
[1:53:36] are we together
[1:53:38] and it was only because of him
[1:53:40] which of course that was why he
[1:53:42] confessed to the disciples it is because
[1:53:45] of me all of this is happening
[1:53:51] it's because i'm coming to you
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:59] because i'm coming to bring you into a
[1:54:01] fellowship that's why you're having all
[1:54:03] the trouble
[1:54:06] that's what brother branham says in
[1:54:07] christ in the mystery of god reveal he
[1:54:09] says that's why we're having all of this
[1:54:10] trouble is because god want to bring us
[1:54:13] into one intimate relationship
[1:54:21] but what do you want us to grab and
[1:54:23] honestly
[1:54:25] he's saying it is i
[1:54:29] he said it is i
[1:54:31] don't be afraid of the storm and all of
[1:54:33] the things that is happening it's
[1:54:34] happening because it is
[1:54:36] me coming closer to you
[1:54:42] praise the lord
[1:54:46] you remember
[1:54:47] the story
[1:54:49] of the couple
[1:54:51] that went through
[1:54:53] their own ordeal whatever the problem
[1:54:55] was
[1:54:56] they were on the brink of a divorce
[1:55:00] he couldn't put up with a woman anymore
[1:55:02] the one that he loved
[1:55:04] at first sight
[1:55:08] praise the lord
[1:55:10] and say you know
[1:55:11] the love of his life but they have come
[1:55:13] to the place where they could not bear
[1:55:14] with one another anymore
[1:55:18] praise the lord
[1:55:20] and both of them look for lawyers and
[1:55:22] you know and they decided to bring this
[1:55:24] whole thing to an end
[1:55:26] glory be to god
[1:55:28] the fuss they swear i want another
[1:55:34] they got into a fight in everything
[1:55:39] and now the court has ruled
[1:55:44] they must separate everything that they
[1:55:45] have
[1:55:47] amen
[1:55:48] they should divide it
[1:55:50] and they can go their separate ways
[1:55:53] glory be to god
[1:55:56] and as they went through the house so i
[1:55:58] want the couch or i want the bed or i
[1:56:00] want this and i want that
[1:56:03] i went through the kitchen the living
[1:56:04] room and everything
[1:56:06] they went up into the attic
[1:56:10] and they started breaking things up
[1:56:12] i don't want this you take this i don't
[1:56:13] want this you take this
[1:56:16] yeah give that to me i bought it with my
[1:56:17] money
[1:56:19] when i first started working my auntie
[1:56:21] gave that to me give it to me
[1:56:25] and i mean it went through everything
[1:56:30] and open this little
[1:56:32] suitcase
[1:56:35] as it went through all
[1:56:38] there was a shoes
[1:56:40] of a little baby
[1:56:43] that they had in their union
[1:56:49] and the baby passed away
[1:56:52] praise the lord
[1:56:55] and as it went through everything
[1:56:58] they saw the baby shoes
[1:57:01] and this one says i want it it's my baby
[1:57:04] snow it's my child
[1:57:07] and that's the look at that shoes memory
[1:57:10] starts to floor their mind
[1:57:15] the wife starts to cry
[1:57:21] the husband starts to cry
[1:57:24] praise the lord
[1:57:26] amen
[1:57:30] maybe it was after the death of that
[1:57:32] child they started being better to one
[1:57:34] another
[1:57:39] maybe the wife blamed the husband he was
[1:57:40] not supporting her enough that's why
[1:57:42] they tried down
[1:57:44] and why and the husband blamed the wife
[1:57:45] you were careless
[1:57:48] that's why you lost our baby
[1:57:56] but the very thing
[1:58:01] that was going to pull them apart
[1:58:05] was the same thing that night
[1:58:11] when he reached their hands to fight
[1:58:13] over the shoes
[1:58:14] they found their hands holding one
[1:58:16] another
[1:58:17] just like the very same way the preacher
[1:58:19] had their hands
[1:58:21] when he blessed him
[1:58:26] he they have told us
[1:58:29] he will heed us
[1:58:32] it's only him that will heal us
[1:58:37] praise the lord amen
[1:58:44] so i thought about this subject
[1:58:46] it was very personal to me
[1:58:49] in different ways
[1:58:51] i was thinking about different things
[1:58:53] you know and different things that are
[1:58:55] happening
[1:58:57] and uh
[1:58:59] i just couldn't get away from it that's
[1:59:00] what i decided to speak on it tonight
[1:59:03] and
[1:59:10] but if you just think about it
[1:59:14] think about all the different things
[1:59:17] that god's people has gone through
[1:59:22] praise the lord
[1:59:27] and you find many of the young people
[1:59:29] and different ones that are turning to
[1:59:31] be eight years and uh you know uh uh uh
[1:59:35] some call themselves spiritual you know
[1:59:37] they say they are spiritual they just i
[1:59:39] mean they are spiritual they just
[1:59:40] worship in their own way but they don't
[1:59:42] believe in god
[1:59:44] and all of these different things
[1:59:47] and every time you talk to people
[1:59:50] all they can tell you in puento is all
[1:59:53] the things that have gone wrong
[1:59:55] to people
[1:59:57] that have served god
[2:00:01] praise the lord
[2:00:04] preachers have laid their bible down
[2:00:07] because they trusted god for the healing
[2:00:10] of a child
[2:00:12] and the child died
[2:00:15] how can i save god
[2:00:18] that can't save my baby
[2:00:23] but the very thing
[2:00:26] that break us
[2:00:29] is the only thing
[2:00:32] that can heal us
[2:00:39] praise the lord
[2:00:41] trying to
[2:00:43] you know uh not to go down setting route
[2:00:46] tonight
[2:00:47] to be very personal but uh
[2:00:50] uh
[2:00:51] i think
[2:00:52] by the grace of god you can get my
[2:00:54] taught where i'm going tonight
[2:00:57] praise the lord
[2:01:03] this is the word of the lord this is i
[2:01:05] mean just just like we said you know
[2:01:07] people has preached
[2:01:10] and sometimes it's not by inspiration
[2:01:12] it's just using the pulpit as you know
[2:01:15] as a place to attack because i'm talking
[2:01:17] you can talk now i have the chance to
[2:01:19] tell you what is on my mind
[2:01:24] praise the lord
[2:01:25] i'm going to say it whether you like it
[2:01:27] or not
[2:01:28] praise the lord and sometimes it's not
[2:01:30] inspiration it's just personal attack
[2:01:36] amen
[2:01:41] but it was good
[2:01:44] because he is the one using it
[2:01:47] to tear us apart
[2:01:51] and sometimes you sit there
[2:01:54] it's oh my goodness
[2:01:56] i'm never coming back to this church
[2:01:58] again
[2:01:59] never coming back
[2:02:01] praise the lord
[2:02:03] i was just thinking about this today the
[2:02:04] last time i was in south africa
[2:02:07] doing the church dedication there for a
[2:02:09] friend of mine
[2:02:10] and
[2:02:12] one of my friends asked me to come in
[2:02:14] and do
[2:02:15] her end of the year service but i wanted
[2:02:18] to be home
[2:02:20] i met you can remember i decided i was
[2:02:22] going to fly back i was not going to
[2:02:23] stay there for the television i wanted
[2:02:26] to be home
[2:02:27] and i was thinking about it today while
[2:02:28] i was meditating and
[2:02:31] i said to myself
[2:02:33] i had it all figured out
[2:02:36] i said
[2:02:37] i told him i said no i told him i said
[2:02:39] brother i want to be home
[2:02:42] maybe i can do that for you next year i
[2:02:44] can come and do your next year christmas
[2:02:46] meeting and just stay over
[2:02:48] and you know a good friend of mine
[2:02:51] and i was just thinking about it
[2:02:54] little did i know
[2:02:56] i would not be able to go back because
[2:02:57] of kovac
[2:03:01] and it was just going through my mind i
[2:03:02] was like oh my goodness lord
[2:03:06] you know oh my goodness
[2:03:07] as glad as i was to come home
[2:03:10] i felt so ache in my heart because the
[2:03:13] brothers most of the brothers in south
[2:03:14] africa they can't have meeting
[2:03:16] like the 31st
[2:03:18] like we are together together because of
[2:03:20] this pack of kovac there
[2:03:23] so most of them can have this kind of a
[2:03:25] meeting
[2:03:26] you know in in in different parts of the
[2:03:28] world and that was just flooding my mind
[2:03:30] today
[2:03:31] as i was just seeking the mercy of god
[2:03:34] you know and you think about all of
[2:03:35] those things and sometimes you do those
[2:03:37] things with the with that with with the
[2:03:39] best with the best truth desire you know
[2:03:42] you do those things with the best zeal
[2:03:44] you know trying to find the word of god
[2:03:47] trying to stay in the word of god
[2:03:50] but i know he's a good friend of mine i
[2:03:51] knew i hurt him i knew her tore his
[2:03:54] heart
[2:04:02] but sometimes
[2:04:03] now sometimes every time
[2:04:05] this happens
[2:04:08] praise the lord
[2:04:14] just like verdig says the lord trying to
[2:04:16] prune us
[2:04:18] amen
[2:04:21] the lord trying to prune us some has
[2:04:23] gone through you know difficult church
[2:04:25] experience difficult marriage experience
[2:04:28] difficult things
[2:04:30] family experience
[2:04:35] and the question over and over how could
[2:04:37] they speak god
[2:04:43] amen
[2:04:44] but like brother branham says god has
[2:04:46] not just made the universe and left it
[2:04:50] for it to be wrong by politician
[2:04:54] or for it to just be run by you know uh
[2:04:57] cruel men
[2:04:59] but
[2:05:00] he's involved
[2:05:03] amen
[2:05:04] he's involved in every aspect of our
[2:05:08] life
[2:05:09] because you have to remember he promised
[2:05:12] i will not leave you
[2:05:14] i will not forsake you
[2:05:19] i would be with you even on to the end
[2:05:27] it is hard
[2:05:29] be not afraid
[2:05:36] he they have torn us
[2:05:41] glory be to god
[2:05:44] if we should just take the rest of the
[2:05:46] night and just share some of our broken
[2:05:49] stories
[2:05:54] we'll have to we have to redo this
[2:05:56] carpet
[2:06:00] because we will have a weeping night
[2:06:05] because you just take one story
[2:06:08] to tear your heart
[2:06:10] some of the things that have been done
[2:06:12] in the name of the lord
[2:06:14] some of the things that have been done
[2:06:16] under the message of the hour
[2:06:18] some of the things that have been done
[2:06:22] trying to express love for god
[2:06:29] but jesus said
[2:06:31] all that the father has given me
[2:06:33] will come
[2:06:35] and there is no man
[2:06:37] there is no one
[2:06:39] that can pluck them out of my hands
[2:06:45] no one can plug them out of my hands
[2:06:50] we don't know
[2:06:52] what the coming year is going to bring
[2:06:55] let's forget about the church
[2:06:58] a little bit
[2:07:01] you just think about
[2:07:03] i mean there is not there is not one
[2:07:07] family
[2:07:08] there is not one family
[2:07:13] they have not been touched
[2:07:15] by this coverage situation
[2:07:20] i mean there is not one family you know
[2:07:22] somebody
[2:07:24] that have lost somebody
[2:07:29] praise the lord
[2:07:38] but he's the only one
[2:07:41] that can heal us
[2:07:43] out of this situation
[2:07:47] we will follow all the safety guy
[2:07:49] we will respect the government
[2:07:52] and all their leadership
[2:07:54] but we are looking to him
[2:07:58] amen
[2:07:58] we are looking to him
[2:08:00] he will heal us
[2:08:03] he they have broken us
[2:08:06] and i believe tonight
[2:08:09] yeah many hats
[2:08:11] that are
[2:08:14] sitting here tonight you can think about
[2:08:17] different
[2:08:19] situations different loved ones and
[2:08:22] different things that you have gone
[2:08:23] through
[2:08:25] and just the thought of it
[2:08:27] is enough to break your heart
[2:08:30] praise the lord
[2:08:32] but remember there's no evil
[2:08:35] happening in the city
[2:08:37] except the lord
[2:08:38] allowed it
[2:08:40] and nothing can happen to you as a child
[2:08:42] as the son of the god of god except god
[2:08:45] allowed it
[2:08:46] praise the lord
[2:08:49] and he says after two days
[2:08:52] he will revive us
[2:08:55] which of course on a prophecy
[2:08:58] it was
[2:09:00] two thousand years for the jews
[2:09:03] and the very same thing has taken place
[2:09:05] to the gentile church
[2:09:09] the very same thing has taken place
[2:09:12] right from
[2:09:14] the day
[2:09:16] jesus the father in your hands i commit
[2:09:18] my spirit
[2:09:21] the church has been going through all
[2:09:24] sorts of things the pharisees gathered
[2:09:26] together you know after his resurrection
[2:09:29] they plotted to go and take the governor
[2:09:31] the disciples stole his body and put a
[2:09:33] pressure on the church
[2:09:35] that's the reason why those disciples
[2:09:37] were running and hiding themselves
[2:09:38] because it was in every paper in
[2:09:40] jerusalem
[2:09:43] this man that was following jesus has
[2:09:44] stolen his body
[2:09:49] and he had to wait in an upper room
[2:09:51] and and uh
[2:09:53] for the promise of the father they
[2:09:54] received the holy ghost they got out and
[2:09:56] started testifying more pressure more
[2:09:59] persecution came on the church
[2:10:02] they have to whip them
[2:10:05] publicly
[2:10:09] and since that time
[2:10:12] the church has gone
[2:10:14] through
[2:10:17] pleasure
[2:10:18] persecution
[2:10:21] in every form
[2:10:25] praise the lord
[2:10:31] this church has gone through
[2:10:34] persecution
[2:10:38] i'm talking about the mystical body of
[2:10:40] jesus christ
[2:10:43] there are some
[2:10:44] that don't even know the current form of
[2:10:46] water baptism
[2:10:48] only their confession
[2:10:51] as jesus
[2:10:52] being their lord and savior they are
[2:10:54] imprisoned
[2:11:02] their brothers
[2:11:03] believing the message of the hour the
[2:11:05] revelation of jesus christ
[2:11:07] they are in praising
[2:11:12] they are people
[2:11:14] going with this great mystery of god
[2:11:16] in their hands they are listening to the
[2:11:18] prophet message
[2:11:20] but yet they don't know where the next
[2:11:22] meal will come from
[2:11:26] they don't know where the next meal will
[2:11:28] come from
[2:11:32] they don't they don't have money in
[2:11:33] their account they don't have no savings
[2:11:35] for their children
[2:11:39] but they are believing
[2:11:43] they are believing amen
[2:11:48] praise the lord
[2:11:54] church
[2:11:56] is the tender hand of jehovah
[2:12:00] it's the hand
[2:12:01] of almighty god
[2:12:04] don't seek to understand it because you
[2:12:06] won't
[2:12:08] praise the lord
[2:12:10] don't think that your trials are over
[2:12:12] because they are not
[2:12:18] but the good thing is
[2:12:21] he
[2:12:22] they have torn us
[2:12:25] he will heal us
[2:12:30] and him and him alone we can lock him
[2:12:33] amen
[2:12:34] for healing so many healing in the
[2:12:36] spirit
[2:12:39] like solomon says
[2:12:41] a broken spirit who can heal
[2:12:46] sometimes you talk to people
[2:12:48] you sit down there you you talk to them
[2:12:50] you counsel and the law will just give
[2:12:53] you the grace to see that this person
[2:12:56] has a broken spirit there is nothing i
[2:12:58] mean you don't have anything
[2:13:00] you can reach there physically to touch
[2:13:02] them
[2:13:04] they will have to be god
[2:13:08] amen
[2:13:10] and we have to be god
[2:13:18] that's the reason why ocl say return
[2:13:24] return
[2:13:26] because where you think you are looking
[2:13:27] for healing you won't find it
[2:13:33] amen
[2:13:34] you won't find it the very thing that
[2:13:36] was that was going to save them in the
[2:13:38] wave was the thing they were afraid of
[2:13:41] they thought it was a spirit instead of
[2:13:43] shouting while the ghost is we will die
[2:13:46] oh god
[2:13:49] but in the midst of the storm he said
[2:13:52] it is i
[2:13:56] be not afraid amen
[2:14:01] in the midst of the storm
[2:14:04] he wants you to understand
[2:14:09] don't blame the preacher
[2:14:11] don't blame the church
[2:14:14] don't blame a
[2:14:15] parent don't blame a loved one look to
[2:14:18] the lord
[2:14:19] he's saying it is our
[2:14:26] amen
[2:14:28] praise the lord this is the only way i
[2:14:30] can achieve my purpose in your life
[2:14:42] i read this quote and now close
[2:14:45] identify masterpiece
[2:14:48] he said
[2:14:49] god is making the bride
[2:14:53] yes sir
[2:14:59] just like how god
[2:15:01] was making man
[2:15:03] out of the dust of the earth
[2:15:06] and now we can appreciate our shapes and
[2:15:09] our form
[2:15:11] when whatever he's doing to us
[2:15:14] whatever
[2:15:15] shape and form of character that he's
[2:15:18] building
[2:15:20] definitely we will appreciate the
[2:15:21] finished product
[2:15:24] when it gets on the other side
[2:15:27] if we can appreciate what we have now
[2:15:31] amen
[2:15:32] if we can appreciate what we have now
[2:15:38] we would definitely appreciate
[2:15:42] when he has mowed us
[2:15:44] into his image
[2:15:48] praise the lord
[2:15:51] when he's done with you
[2:15:54] you'll be so glad
[2:15:56] you'll be so glad
[2:15:59] so glad
[2:16:04] praise the lord
[2:16:06] you'll be so glad
[2:16:09] you know tries is just like a shock to
[2:16:12] the body
[2:16:14] sometimes it's like electric shock
[2:16:18] and that is the reason why in the time
[2:16:20] of trial
[2:16:22] it's difficult for us to have praise
[2:16:28] because the mind of the the mind is
[2:16:30] running what have i done
[2:16:33] lord where did i miss the mark
[2:16:38] and sometimes we we we
[2:16:40] we we don't first
[2:16:42] talk to the lord and ask the lord it's
[2:16:44] either we're talking to the person that
[2:16:45] is doing us wrong or we're talking to
[2:16:47] ourselves
[2:16:51] when it's not the person when it's not
[2:16:53] yourself it's just god having you on the
[2:16:55] wheel
[2:17:00] just having you spinning you on the
[2:17:01] wheel
[2:17:03] just to make a good out of you
[2:17:09] just to make a good out of you
[2:17:12] praise the lord
[2:17:15] do you realize if we had the privilege
[2:17:17] to make ourselves
[2:17:20] what kind of creatures we have on the
[2:17:21] earth
[2:17:25] praise the lord
[2:17:27] amen after god has made us to see what
[2:17:31] man is doing in changing what god has
[2:17:34] made
[2:17:35] if we had the privilege to marry ourself
[2:17:38] my goodness
[2:17:43] my goodness
[2:17:49] we could have never got it right
[2:17:51] than the way it is
[2:17:54] amen we could have never got it any
[2:17:58] better
[2:17:59] than the way that he made it
[2:18:05] praise the lord
[2:18:09] so there is no way there's no way
[2:18:12] nothing you can do
[2:18:13] to ever make it better
[2:18:15] every time you try to fix it you just
[2:18:17] make it more worse
[2:18:22] amen
[2:18:25] take out the teeth he gives you tried to
[2:18:27] pour gold that you just put in cancer in
[2:18:29] your mouth
[2:18:31] you're just making it worse
[2:18:33] every time you try to fix it
[2:18:41] he is making the bride yes sir
[2:18:45] he's held in the chips now chopping off
[2:18:48] the word
[2:18:50] oh
[2:18:51] church joining increase and denomination
[2:18:55] and dogma do you see why we have gone
[2:18:58] through everything that we have gone
[2:19:00] through
[2:19:04] everything that we have gone through
[2:19:06] even in the message of the hour is
[2:19:08] because god is sticking out
[2:19:12] joining church
[2:19:14] because we think when we say i'm in a
[2:19:16] message we think is it's a ticket to the
[2:19:18] rapture
[2:19:22] god is throwing that through the window
[2:19:26] that your church membership means
[2:19:29] nothing to him
[2:19:31] amen the thing that is important to god
[2:19:33] is your sonship
[2:19:35] as a son of god or a daughter of god
[2:19:40] not because you join a church
[2:19:43] but because you know
[2:19:45] you are a son of god you have a
[2:19:47] relationship
[2:19:50] and you appreciate that
[2:19:53] to know that
[2:19:55] he's my father
[2:19:57] and i'm his child
[2:20:02] and you get in your relationship with
[2:20:03] him
[2:20:04] learning his ways
[2:20:08] realizing that he can go wrong
[2:20:11] but you can go wrong
[2:20:16] so you're learning his ways
[2:20:21] church joining creeds a bunch of creeds
[2:20:24] hanging around us
[2:20:26] when we talk about creeds we try all to
[2:20:28] denominations but we have a bunch of
[2:20:30] creeds hanging around us
[2:20:32] amen
[2:20:33] we got into different factions
[2:20:35] denominations and dark matters
[2:20:38] all has to be cut away from the church
[2:20:44] god had to cut all of this away
[2:20:48] cut all the worldliness
[2:20:51] cut all the the church joining and all
[2:20:54] the creeds that we have
[2:20:59] ourselves may create
[2:21:04] he has to cut it from the church
[2:21:07] there are formal ideas
[2:21:10] things that have stuck in our spirit
[2:21:16] and we always think that it has to be
[2:21:18] there for it to be right
[2:21:22] because it's stuck there
[2:21:26] praise the lord
[2:21:28] we will never know the damage
[2:21:34] that
[2:21:35] pagan rome has done
[2:21:38] to the church
[2:21:39] we will never know the damage that has
[2:21:41] come down through
[2:21:43] the ages there are things that are just
[2:21:45] stuck there
[2:21:51] praise the lord
[2:21:52] we talk a little bit of that when we're
[2:21:54] doing parallel on on babylon in parallel
[2:21:57] on israel
[2:21:58] i mean parallel to babylon and israel
[2:22:01] from our ideas their in indifference
[2:22:04] their doctrines and things come back and

[2:22:57] for you to be able

[2:23:29] and strike the word
[2:23:31] says jesus christ the same yesterday
[2:23:35] today and forever
[2:23:37] and you were saying
[2:23:38] amen

[2:24:03] you can make
[2:24:04] you can put any meaning
[2:24:06] to why you are on earth
[2:24:09] it's when the master
[2:24:11] picks you in his hands
[2:24:14] and take the ball

[2:48:47] first corinthians chapter 11.
[2:48:50] [Music]
[2:49:17] so
[2:49:19] [Music]
[2:49:32] first quarter in chapter 11.
[2:49:35] let's turn there
[2:49:38] there's a fountain filled with blood
[2:49:40] drinking from emmanuel vein
[2:49:42] you can play that softly
[2:49:49] we'll read first corinthians chapter 11
[2:49:51] verse 23.
[2:49:54] [Music]
[2:49:57] for i've received of the lord that which
[2:50:00] also i deliver unto you
[2:50:02] that the lord
[2:50:04] jesus
[2:50:05] the same night in which he had he was
[2:50:08] betrayed took bread
[2:50:10] and when he had given thanks he break it
[2:50:13] and said
[2:50:15] take it this is my body which is broken
[2:50:18] for you
[2:50:20] this do in remembrance of me
[2:50:23] after the same manner also he took the
[2:50:26] cup when he have suffered saying
[2:50:28] this cup
[2:50:30] is the new testament
[2:50:32] of my blood
[2:50:34] this do you as off as you drink it in
[2:50:37] remembrance of me
[2:50:40] for as often as ye eat this bread and
[2:50:43] drink this cup
[2:50:45] you do show the lord's death till he
[2:50:47] comes
[2:50:48] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:50:52] and drink this cup of the lord on
[2:50:53] waterling
[2:50:55] shall be guilty
[2:50:56] of the body and the blood of the lord
[2:51:00] but let a man examine himself
[2:51:04] and so let him eat
[2:51:06] of the bread and drink
[2:51:08] of that cup
[2:51:10] for he that eat it and drink it on
[2:51:12] walter he didn't drink a damnation to
[2:51:14] himself
[2:51:16] not discerning the lord's body
[2:51:19] for this cause many are weak
[2:51:21] and sacred among you
[2:51:23] and many sleep
[2:51:26] for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:51:28] should not be george
[2:51:30] but when we are judged we are trusting
[2:51:33] of the lord
[2:51:34] that we should not be condemned
[2:51:37] with the word
[2:51:39] wherefore my brethren when you come
