[45:21] Praise the Lord.
[45:24] But it's good to be in the house of the
[45:26] Lord. I will uh stand with brother Ben
[45:29] and say we want to thank and appreciate
[45:31] each and every one of you. Thank you for
[45:33] your prayers. Thank you for your
[45:35] support. Amen.
[45:37] And uh
[45:40] uh you know we
[45:42] we uh
[45:44] just think about uh
[45:47] uh
[45:49] how the Lord has been uh
[45:52] good to us and and all of the things
[45:55] that uh he has brought us through as a
[45:59] church.
[46:01] Amen.
[46:03] as I was uh
[46:06] just appreciating the Lord uh last night
[46:09] and and
[46:11] getting ready for service this morning.
[46:14] By the way, brother brother Jain is
[46:16] going to bring us uh the message this
[46:19] morning. You appreciate the message on
[46:22] uh Friday night.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] [Applause]
[46:29] That was a short and quick one. Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; He told me he was going to preach shot.
[46:34] I didn't know it was going to be that
[46:36] shot or else I was going to bring my
[46:39] notes right behind him. Praise the Lord.
[46:43] But uh thank you also for supporting the
[46:47] prayer meeting on uh Friday night. Like
[46:50] I told you, it was it was going to drive
[46:54] itself in a way that it was just uh a
[46:58] service of appreciation. We just wanted
[47:00] to come and thank the Lord for being
[47:03] with us as a church and uh I know some
[47:07] came from work and uh and some had to
[47:10] leave, go home, get sleep and go to
[47:12] work. We understand all of that. But we
[47:15] want to appreciate you for uh being part
[47:18] of the service even those that were not
[47:20] able to come and were able to stream in.
[47:23] You know church is uh it's a place where
[47:27] some come to associate
[47:31] they love their friends and uh they love
[47:36] their relative. They love the people.
[47:39] For some other people church is a place
[47:41] where they come to hang out
[47:44] and uh they enjoy the music.
[47:50] But for the children of God, church is
[47:53] our life.
[47:55] Praise the Lord. Church is our life.
[47:59] Because whether we are in this building
[48:02] or we are at home or we are at work, we
[48:06] are in church. We are never away from
[48:09] his presence. So church is our life.
[48:13] Whether we are on vacation, we are in
[48:16] church.
[48:17] Praise the Lord.
[48:20] And if you remember, I told you this uh
[48:22] uh many years ago when I started here,
[48:28] especially
[48:29] stepping in as the pastor,
[48:34] the success
[48:36] to every relationship
[48:39] is when you all can grow up together.
[48:45] I might have been preaching. I having
[48:48] one year over this church. This church
[48:50] is 30 years old. I've been preaching for
[48:51] 31 years. So I feel older than the
[48:54] church.
[48:59] But I mean you can take a person from
[49:02] anywhere. You can take a old preacher.
[49:05] You can bring uh uh any any of the
[49:08] preachers that can run through your
[49:10] mind. You bring him to this church or
[49:13] take him to a new church.
[49:16] If that preacher do not step down
[49:21] and grow with the people,
[49:24] it will never be successful.
[49:29] the best way you can see it. Sometimes
[49:32] that's the thing that affect us in our
[49:36] parenting
[49:39] because we don't want to step down to
[49:40] the level of our children
[49:43] even in marriage relationship.
[49:48] If you don't grow together,
[49:50] if you don't understand it that this is
[49:53] a family that had just been birthed,
[49:56] your family when you take your vow, oh,
[49:58] we have a baby dedication. I shouldn't
[50:00] forget that.
[50:02] And I think it's a good thing. Amen.
[50:04] Praise the Lord. It's a sign of life.
[50:06] Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; So, uh, Brother Ery told me they were
[50:10] going to do at the end of the month last
[50:11] night. He told me, uh, today. So, I
[50:14] said, Lord, thank you. I mean, it's it's
[50:16] a sign of life. Praise the Lord.
[50:18] you know uh if you if you don't
[50:20] understand it when you take your vow and
[50:22] you said uh yes I do and you say that
[50:25] you know uh uh uh you know uh uh uh in
[50:31] in sickness and in health and you you
[50:33] take that vow you have to understand
[50:37] that uh uh you know uh uh a child has
[50:41] just been born that union has just been
[50:45] born and you have to grow. But what
[50:48] happened were we all stop we get stuck
[50:52] in our individual identity and that's
[50:56] where the crisis come
[50:58] and uh uh so in every in every
[51:01] relationship I've I've understand that
[51:05] in dealing with uh church you have to we
[51:08] all have to grow together you know you
[51:11] have to bear with me and I have to bear
[51:12] with you and I think you've been very
[51:14] good bearing with me. Amen. You've been
[51:17] very good bearing with me in these days
[51:19] where I'm in memory loss. You are all
[51:20] bearing with me. So, it's all good.
[51:23] Praise the Lord.
[51:25] So, uh uh I pray that uh uh we don't
[51:30] know how many years, you know, that the
[51:32] Lord uh will have us be here and uh but
[51:38] we hope to be here till Jesus come.
[51:40] Amen. Or if we go by the weight of the
[51:43] grave, praise the Lord. And uh I pray
[51:47] that uh the Lord will bless us together.
[51:51] The Lord will bless us together. Praise
[51:53] the Lord. And uh Brother Wesley and
[51:56] sister Carol spoke to brother Wesley
[51:59] yesterday. He want for us to continue to
[52:01] pray for them. He told me giving an
[52:04] update on his uh uh visit to the doctor
[52:08] just like I said because of the
[52:10] sunlight. So they had to inject some
[52:13] steroids in his eyes to see if it will
[52:15] kind of his help his eyesight and also
[52:19] uh uh uh sar went for a checkup, you
[52:24] know. Uh uh when you have uh people that
[52:29] have lived
[52:32] many years, few years in a church, it's
[52:35] a blessing. It's a blessing. especially
[52:38] when you have them with a long walking
[52:40] experience. I mean, brother Wesley and
[52:42] his sister Cara have 50 years of
[52:45] marriage relationship. So, we it works.
[52:49] If it work for them, it can work for
[52:50] you. Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; It can work for me. So, all of those
[52:53] things encourage when you have people uh
[52:57] of those years and age. And sister Carol
[52:59] had a blessing to be in the service
[53:01] where marriage and divorce was preached.
[53:04] her brother was a deacon there in
[53:05] Brandham Tabernacle. So uh uh but beside
[53:09] that both of them had their personal
[53:12] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[53:14] So we thank the Lord for that. Amen. And
[53:17] we want to thank the Lord also for the
[53:19] grace he's given to sister Naomi and uh
[53:23] we appreciate we appreciate her. We
[53:26] appreciate her.
[53:28] uh her husband was our long song leader
[53:32] turning over to his song Lloyd and all
[53:34] of that, but he's looking down from
[53:37] behind the curtain of time. Amen. We
[53:40] want to thank the Lord for all of that.
[53:42] And uh and that's that's how we we you
[53:47] know that's how we'll be going you know
[53:49] and uh as we grow up together just like
[53:51] I said if the Lord Jesus tried all of
[53:54] these young ladies sitting down down
[53:57] there we will go to their graduation and
[54:00] the next thing will be looking forward
[54:01] to their wedding. Praise the Lord.
[54:06] And and that's just how generation comes
[54:08] and generation goes. Praise the Lord.

[55:35] Little ones to him
[55:40] belong.

[55:49] And yes,
[55:51] Jesus
[55:52] loves me.

[55:57] Jesus
[55:59] loves me.
[56:02] Oh yes,
[56:05] Jesus

[56:09] The Bible
[56:12] tells me so. Let's sing that one more
[56:15] time. We sing. Yes,
[56:19] Jesus
[56:20] loves me.
[56:23] Oh yes,
[56:25] Jesus
[56:27] loves me.
[56:30] Oh yes,
[56:32] Jesus
[56:34] loves me.
[56:36] The Bible
[56:39] tells me so.
[56:42] [Music]
[56:43] &gt;&gt; But I had a little testimony before we
[56:46] dedicate this baby.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's good to be in the house of
[56:55] the Lord uh this morning. Uh I had a
[56:59] little testimony to share with you for
[57:01] the glory of God.
[57:03] Uh and as many of you guys might have uh
[57:07] known that uh uh we had lost a baby
[57:11] after Joseph
[57:13] uh but God is merciful and gracious unto
[57:16] us. Uh God has been so good to us that I
[57:20] can't even know how to express it. Um
[57:23] but anyway, so when we had lost the
[57:26] baby, it was very very hard for me and
[57:29] my wife and uh we went through a lot. We
[57:33] went through a lot and and it was really
[57:35] hard for us and uh just to remember that
[57:40] I appreciate brother one. He was there
[57:41] with us praying for us and supporting us
[57:44] to the best of his ability.
[57:47] And just as we were we were just praying
[57:51] and just waiting on the Lord and we came
[57:54] to to learn that my wife was expecting
[57:56] another baby
[57:58] and uh that was really a blessing to us.
[58:01] And you know when you lose a baby and
[58:03] fear comes in but for some reason God
[58:06] just created the atmosphere around the
[58:08] house that was just special. You know
[58:10] for those that been in the house we
[58:12] always listen to the tape playing 24
[58:14] hours. So the atmosphere was just right
[58:16] to welcome the baby. And um as we were
[58:20] just expecting the baby, we didn't know
[58:23] if we wanted a boy or a girl. So for
[58:26] some reason, God inspired both of us to
[58:28] have my parents over just before the
[58:30] travel. And uh uh we um we invited them
[58:36] and we were sitting with them at home. I
[58:38] think my sister, my older sister had the
[58:40] result if he was whether girl or boy.
[58:43] And as we were sitting there, uh, my
[58:46] sister just announced and say, "Oh,
[58:48] wow." You know, it's a girl, you know,
[58:50] and I was so happy. I never cried like
[58:52] that. Those that were there at the home,
[58:54] I just I just cried like a baby in front
[58:56] of everybody because it looks like I was
[58:59] holding a lot of things in my heart
[59:00] until uh that specific day. Uh so that
[59:05] very night uh we had a prayer meeting.
[59:08] How many of us know that we always have
[59:09] prayer meeting every single night? And
[59:11] then that very same night in because we
[59:14] we usually just read chapter after
[59:16] chapter every single day. But that day
[59:19] that specific day that we knew the
[59:21] general reveal uh we read in the Bible I
[59:24] just want excuse me I'll just grab my
[59:26] iPad and uh it's in the book of
[59:29] Deuteronomy
[59:30] um
[59:34] in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 32 if
[59:36] we can project it. Deuteronomy 32 uh 39.
[59:42] Deuteronomy 32:39. For those that were
[59:45] there, that's the scripture we read for
[59:47] that day.
[59:53] Deuteronomy 32:39.
[1:00:00] All righty. And this was the scripture
[1:00:02] of that day. It says, "See now that I
[1:00:06] even I am he and there is no God with
[1:00:10] me. I kill
[1:00:13] and I make alive and I wound and I heal.
[1:00:18] Neither is there any that can deliver
[1:00:20] out of my hand."
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; That was the scripture we read that very
[1:00:25] day that we knew that we were expecting
[1:00:28] a girl. Uh and just as of the name of
[1:00:32] the child, um it happens probably
[1:00:36] uh the year we got married. I think
[1:00:38] Joseph was not even born yet, but we
[1:00:40] knew that we were expecting. We were
[1:00:42] driving to church a Sunday. I think it
[1:00:44] was July 17, 2022.
[1:00:47] While driving, I don't know if I had a
[1:00:49] dream or a vision or whatever. So, while
[1:00:51] we were driving, I turned straight to my
[1:00:53] wife. I said, "Take your Bible, write
[1:00:56] this name down and write the date."
[1:01:00] And my wife, actually the name, I didn't
[1:01:02] even know it was a Bible name. So, I
[1:01:04] just told her, "This is the name that
[1:01:06] came into my spirit. I don't know if I
[1:01:07] was dreaming or what. Just write the
[1:01:09] date next to it and let's, you know,
[1:01:11] let's move on." Then Joseph was born,
[1:01:13] you know, uh, and then the baby that we
[1:01:15] lost was born. And as we were looking
[1:01:18] for the name of the baby just right
[1:01:20] there my wife just looked at me and say
[1:01:23] area do you remember there is a name in
[1:01:25] the Bible that we had put there and that
[1:01:27] was the name of the baby and the name of
[1:01:29] the baby is Kaziah Faith Gongo. So
[1:01:32] Kaziah is the name of Job's daughter
[1:01:34] that he had lost when uh after he had
[1:01:38] lost all his children. So may God bless
[1:01:40] you tonight. Thank you for your prayers.
[1:01:42] [Applause]
[1:01:49] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:01:52] dear Lord, we hold this uh gift of life
[1:01:56] in our hands. So, Father God, we want to
[1:01:59] thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:02:04] being with uh brother Ariel and sister
[1:02:06] Naisha.
[1:02:08] Father Lord God and uh especially Lord

[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible
[1:33:31] has been quickened
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; for you.

[1:34:38] if I feel a little bit nervous.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.

[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:35:04] when it comes
[1:35:06] when it come to the things of God to
[1:35:09] God. Amen.

[1:35:11] I'm like a foolish
[1:35:14] glory.
[1:35:16] Nothing can hold me. Naturally,
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; I am someone
[1:35:21] to God.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; I'm very timid.
[1:35:26] that I'm naturally taking to God.
[1:35:30] But when it comes to the gospel,
[1:35:34] that's why Jesus Christ to
[1:35:39] redeem me. Hallelujah.

[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; That's why take everything

[1:36:10] has kept me.
[1:36:12] Amen.
[1:36:17] There were time that I had issues.
[1:36:20] The the gospel had kept me. Brother
[1:36:22] Venom said, "I've traveled many around
[1:36:26] the world
[1:36:28] and this gospel has kept me
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; and I also have traveled
[1:36:34] maybe in a jungle
[1:36:36] in in a very remote place." Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe there were were aggressors.
[1:36:47] But God has kept me.
[1:36:50] This gospel is the truth.
[1:36:53] That's why when I talk about it and I
[1:36:55] know where I stand,
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Without this message,
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I would not be of this. Without this
[1:37:06] message, Hallelujah. Glory be to God.
[1:37:10] But he had kept me.
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; I was bringing the gospel somewhere.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:19] somewhere
[1:37:25] there were people
[1:37:28] they will put uh some some trap around
[1:37:31] the on the the road on the road. Yes.
[1:37:37] They will put some trap on the road and
[1:37:40] the road cannot cross
[1:37:44] and and and take everything that you
[1:37:46] have.
[1:37:49] and I was going toward another city to
[1:37:51] preach the gospel
[1:37:53] and I've taken the road
[1:37:56] and I didn't know that they were trapped
[1:37:58] or the road was not right good and it
[1:38:02] was really a night glory be to God

[1:38:17] and they were trying to move all the the
[1:38:22] scared
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; and I was very calm. I was driving.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:38:34] She asked me, "Why are you not afraid?"
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; But we have already made a choice.
[1:38:41] I said, brother Bam said
[1:38:45] when somebody is in a missionary
[1:38:48] always in the will of God
[1:38:51] that because he have received and the
[1:38:53] word says preach the gospel to all
[1:38:57] creation
[1:38:59] that therefore I have a mission and that
[1:39:02] commission
[1:39:04] and that commission require

[1:39:28] be to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:39:50] and the wife had cooked something
[1:39:52] and it was and we were eating
[1:39:58] and there are things that are very
[1:39:59] special

[1:40:16] here.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; People are waiting for the manifestation
[1:40:23] that happened in the episode of
[1:40:28] People are expecting to see miracles and
[1:40:30] wonders.
[1:40:33] But if we want to see signs and and
[1:40:36] miracles,
[1:40:38] if we want to see these things,
[1:40:43] you cannot
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; you cannot see the apostoical blessings.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; If you not place under the
[1:40:49] apostomosphere,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; they were under a certain atmosphere.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; They were under a certain condition.
[1:40:59] They were under expectation.
[1:41:02] Glory be to God.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:41:06] We cannot see these things
[1:41:09] if you are not under the same condition.
[1:41:12] Amen.
[1:41:15] So what that's why I want to draw your
[1:41:16] attention.
[1:41:18] These things are possible
[1:41:20] because of this person.
[1:41:23] You have to be under the same.
[1:41:26] You have to be under expectation
[1:41:28] and the same expectation
[1:41:31] into the same
[1:41:34] they needed the Holy Ghost. Why?
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Because it was promised.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Knowing having such promises
[1:41:46] Paul says
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:50] Corinthian 2 Corinthians chapter 7
[1:41:53] having such promises
[1:41:57] We have to prepare ourselves
[1:42:01] to be sanctified
[1:42:03] and consecrated life.
[1:42:07] But when are we putting ourselves under
[1:42:09] that condition?
[1:42:11] Now it he has to be
[1:42:14] there promise.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; If there is no promise,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; you cannot wait for something.

[1:42:25] If somebody can say amen,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; glory be to God.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; When they ask a young lady, amen,
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; I would like to marry you.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; It's a promise.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Now, because of the promise, you
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; without the promise, you'll just feel
[1:42:47] normal or ordinary.

[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; She feels special.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; She's not like the rest of them.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she had received a promise.
[1:43:06] Now, there's a man that had chosen out
[1:43:08] of many. She was
[1:43:12] amen.
[1:43:14] She's not like the rest of them. Glory

[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; The promise
[1:43:36] works on youmise.

[1:44:00] Maybe
[1:44:01] they have not received
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; the promises.
[1:44:08] Glory be to God.
[1:44:12] is because of the promise
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; that the 120 went to the upper room
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; and the rest of them they were just
[1:44:21] sitting there
[1:44:23] with them they have received the promise
[1:44:30] they couldn't wait some for something
[1:44:31] else uh out of what was promised to

[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Shows these things.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; You may not see it in your life.

[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; This morning,
[1:44:58] I want to tell you
[1:45:01] to be under the condition

[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; You have to be under that atmosphere.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; You have to be under that expectation.
[1:45:21] That's why I appreciate the the prayer
[1:45:22] meeting.
[1:45:26] Because it's the alltime prayer meeting.
[1:45:29] That's why people don't do things. It is
[1:45:32] important
[1:45:33] to stay there
[1:45:36] and to to treat with God
[1:45:38] and God deals with you connection that
[1:45:41] there's a connection

[1:46:00] God is determined
[1:46:03] to be made seen to be made unveil
[1:46:05] himself before
[1:46:08] is because there's so much going on on
[1:46:10] on the earth
[1:46:12] is really bothering
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; and the trials of life
[1:46:18] and people are are not expecting.
[1:46:22] You have to expect or to wait for the
[1:46:24] Lord.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; You have to expect something from the
[1:46:28] Lord.

[1:46:48] Glory be to God. You wait
[1:46:52] because it was set on you.
[1:46:55] He has to come to you.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; He has to be made manifest. Glory be to
[1:47:00] God.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; He never changed.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; He's the same Lord.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; "Be transformed. Be transformed."
[1:47:11] But the renewing of your mind
[1:47:13] because there is a way.
[1:47:16] Look at things. Now
[1:47:18] I want to tell you something. I won't be
[1:47:21] long.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:47:25] there is forming
[1:47:29] There's deformed
[1:47:31] [Music]

[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Well, where are you going?
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; God has formed us
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; in his own garden
[1:47:50] after he had spoken
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; and we came forth.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; The spoken word. The spoken word is the
[1:47:57] original seed.
[1:48:01] He spoke
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; and things had happened.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Adam had come forth.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Adam was the image
[1:48:14] of God on earth
[1:48:17] and later on Eve
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; came forth from Adam
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; and God had formed.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:25] He begin to speak
[1:48:29] after he had finished form
[1:48:32] Adam
[1:48:34] was not afraid
[1:48:36] to God
[1:48:39] because the spirit that was in Adam
[1:48:42] to God
[1:48:44] was the spirit of God.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; There was no fear whatsoever in this man
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; that was in Adam. dominated.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; He was made to dominate
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; not to be dominated.
[1:49:03] He had to dominate
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; this man
[1:49:07] because inside of Adam
[1:49:10] to God
[1:49:12] it's there
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; when God had formed
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; this man
[1:49:19] had the full domination or control
[1:49:22] and the enemy has come.
[1:49:25] Glory to God
[1:49:28] is not a creator.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:32] He is the king of perversion.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; He has come to deform
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; what God had formed.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Satan deforms.
[1:49:50] Now when the Holy Ghost came.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Now Paul speaks he says be transformed.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] But when you were formed,
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; you didn't you didn't have fear.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; You were hid
[1:50:12] behind the the strength of the
[1:50:16] fortress of the word was keeping men.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Now when man lost his position,
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; he was deformed.
[1:50:30] He stopped being afraid of animals
[1:50:33] of the of the lion
[1:50:36] because Satan had deformed him.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Glory be given to God.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; There is a time of restoration
[1:50:46] where God
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; is transforming.
[1:50:50] Glory be to God.
[1:50:52] He's bringing back the original
[1:50:55] that was on the other side.
[1:50:58] Now in you

[1:51:05] what the co the pal and the lockers have
[1:51:07] done has has eaten
[1:51:11] God has not forgotten you
[1:51:14] is remembering of you

[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; In the Laudian church age
[1:53:34] and this angel,
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; this message of Malachi 4 and Revelation
[1:53:39] 10:7

[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; It's the apostolic faith. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; And in order for you to have that faith
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; that is tangible.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.

[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; But sometime you feel really little.
[1:54:26] Don't look at yourself.
[1:54:29] Look what it says about you. Hallelujah.
[1:54:31] Amen.
[1:54:33] Don't look at yourself.
[1:54:35] Maybe you feel little.
[1:54:38] But look at what said about you.
[1:54:41] Glory be to God.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; I was somewhere in in the in the jungle
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; to bring the message.
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:54:59] And now there's a woman that uh that
[1:55:01] lost her mind. She was insane.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Now the devil wanted to to witchcraft
[1:55:08] make her dance or things of that nature.
[1:55:10] But she didn't want to
[1:55:13] and the spirits kind of troubled her.
[1:55:18] Now they they heard that there's a
[1:55:20] pastor that was coming
[1:55:22] and they banned her
[1:55:26] and then I came there at night
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; and with all the pastors
[1:55:32] they said pastor
[1:55:35] look what had just happened here.
[1:55:41] come and pray for this woman. She was a
[1:55:42] married woman.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Now, if you see somebody that is insane,
[1:55:50] you look at yourself,
[1:55:54] what sometime you look at yourself, you
[1:55:56] say, "What can I do for this person?"
[1:55:57] Amen.
[1:55:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:01] Now when you look at yourself,
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; you start underestimate yourself.
[1:56:08] Look at what God has spoken about you.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Now it's the one that fulfills.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; It's not you that does it. Is he him?
[1:56:20] He takes care of his own word.
[1:56:24] I spoke I spoke to the group.
[1:56:32] as
[1:56:36] [Music]
[1:56:38] now when we arrived they had a certain
[1:56:40] meeting.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; They said there's a meeting going on
[1:56:44] here.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; I said bring her in that meeting.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Me I cannot do anything but him alone.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:58] shows.
[1:57:01] Often he does things that you can never
[1:57:03] imagine.
[1:57:05] And I went behind the pulpit
[1:57:07] preaching the gospel.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; I was preaching the gospel.
[1:57:14] In my spirit, I was thinking about this.
[1:57:16] Glory be to God.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; And we finished.
[1:57:21] Now we walked down and pray for her and
[1:57:24] we we let let her lay down and it was a
[1:57:27] Sunday. It was a Saturday.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Sunday morning.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Now that woman was the first one to
[1:57:35] arrive to church.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:57:40] Glory be to God.
[1:57:43] and I went to preach
[1:57:47] and I asked who wanted to be baptized
[1:57:50] and she came forth.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I have pictures.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; When I came said father the woman was
[1:57:58] the first one to be in water with me
[1:58:01] and I pray for her.
[1:58:03] I baptize her in the name of the Lord
[1:58:05] Jesus Christ. Then now when we came out
[1:58:09] my husband says what? I said she's free.
[1:58:14] When I came,
[1:58:16] I was asking myself,
[1:58:19] I said, "What had happened?" Glory be to
[1:58:21] God.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; It was God.
[1:58:24] He takes care of his own word. That's
[1:58:27] right. God,
[1:58:29] he watches over his own word.
[1:58:33] That's why don't look at yourself who
[1:58:35] are

[1:58:37] he has says about you. yesterday said
[1:58:39] about you.

[1:58:52] in the jungle.

[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:56] I'm in Abigen, but I travel
[1:58:59] in in the in the middle of the jungle.

[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; because people that are there,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; they have witchcraft,
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; they have juju,
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; but they want to see your guide to do
[1:59:14] great things.

[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; that Satan had operated?
[2:18:32] What Satan had done, God has come to

[2:30:13] I don't know. They are dead bones." But
[2:30:15] you see, because in God's mind, this was
[2:30:20] concerning his people to bring them
[2:30:23] back. Praise the Lord. You see, when he
[2:30:27] when when the brother was talking about
[2:30:29] God form us in his image and when the
[2:30:33] fall came, we were deformed.
[2:30:37] And now through the cross through
[2:30:40] Calvary have come to transform us which
[2:30:44] mean to bring us back. Do you know many
[2:30:47] times people think that word transform
[2:30:51] means to change a sinner to a sinner.
[2:30:57] Not literally what it means. It's true.
[2:30:59] We are sinners saved by grace. But what
[2:31:02] it means is to bring us back
[2:31:06] to who we were.
[2:31:10] So the transforming power of God
[2:31:14] is just bringing out of you what is in
[2:31:16] you.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. Uh uh uh
[2:31:23] we were formed. The devil came through
[2:31:27] his lies and deform us. He mess with our
[2:31:30] mind. But the transforming power of God
[2:31:33] has come to bring that original seed
[2:31:37] that was in you to bring you back to
[2:31:40] what you were.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And how God is doing it
[2:31:46] just like what Ezekiel did
[2:31:49] by prophesying over the dead bones.
[2:31:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; He just prophesied. Just imagine you all
[2:31:57] we we are all living yet. I don't see
[2:31:59] any dead person here tonight or this
[2:32:02] afternoon. And uh but those were dead
[2:32:05] bones, dry bones in the valley. And all
[2:32:08] the prophet needed to do was just to
[2:32:11] keep repeating the word.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; He just kept prophesying over the dead
[2:32:17] bones and and immediately the the the
[2:32:19] Bible says there was there was a revival
[2:32:22] in the valley. The bones started to
[2:32:24] move.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see and and and
[2:32:28] that's the same thing that happen when
[2:32:30] the word of God is preached
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; to sons and daughters of God. When the
[2:32:36] promise of God, the promises in this
[2:32:38] book are h are rehearsed over your life.
[2:32:42] When they are repeated to you, we have
[2:32:45] to identify it.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; You see many of the times what we trying
[2:32:48] to do is that we we take church like we
[2:32:51] are in classroom, we are in school. No,
[2:32:54] you are not in school. Praise the Lord.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the testimony of Jesus
[2:33:00] Christ is the spirit of prophecy.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; So most of what is done is that God is
[2:33:06] prophesying over your life and you must
[2:33:08] be there to receive it.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; And say be it unto me that calling to
[2:33:13] your word. Say amen Lord. Thank you for
[2:33:15] your word. Thank you for the promises.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:33:22] Yes. I will restore,
[2:33:26] say the Lord.
[2:33:30] I will restore,
[2:33:34] say

[2:34:42] That's what he said.

[2:35:12] Oh, I will restore,
[2:35:17] said the Lord. Yes, I will restore,
[2:35:23] say the Lord.

[2:35:56] restore,
[2:35:58] say the Lord.
[2:36:02] A Jehovah promise, a Holy Ghost promise.
[2:36:08] I will restore.
[2:36:12] Thus, said the Lord.
[2:36:15] I will restore.
[2:36:19] Thou said, Oh yes, I will restore.
[2:36:26] Yes, Lord. That's your word. Oh, I will
[2:36:30] restore,
[2:36:33] said the Lord.
[2:36:36] Jehovah
[2:36:38] promise. A Holy Ghost promise.
[2:36:43] I will restore.
[2:36:46] Thou said the Lord.
[2:36:50] I will restore,
[2:36:53] say the Lord.
[2:36:58] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[2:37:01] [Music]
[2:37:04] Don't be afraid to worship the Lord with
[2:37:06] your hand clap, people. Let's give the
[2:37:08] Lord a hand of praise. He's worth it to
[2:37:10] be praised.
[2:37:12] [Music]
[2:37:14] [Applause]
[2:37:14] [Music]
[2:37:22] I love when he said a closed mouth is a
[2:37:25] closed destiny.
[2:37:27] It's truth.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem and you don't
[2:37:31] speak it, you don't ask anybody or you
[2:37:35] don't talk about it. Sometimes it's in
[2:37:37] talking that's when we find solution.
[2:37:41] A closed mouth is a close destiny.
[2:37:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:37:46] We have to speak to the Lord. I was just
[2:37:49] thinking about that last night. You you
[2:37:51] see when you look in the Bible, you see
[2:37:53] how some of these men pray. Look look at
[2:37:55] Jeremiah. He said he said, "Lord, you
[2:37:57] deceive me."
[2:37:59] He said, "You deceive me." Because
[2:38:01] Jeremiah being a young man, when he
[2:38:03] received the word and and the word was
[2:38:04] burning in his heart, the Lord told him,
[2:38:06] "Go and preach the word. You you are
[2:38:08] ordained to preach this gospel." But
[2:38:11] when he went, it was not that easy.
[2:38:14] The people rejected him. They put him in
[2:38:16] prison. He said, "Oh God, you your your
[2:38:20] your word consume him, but I feel
[2:38:22] deceived. It looks like I'm betrayed."
[2:38:25] He was not he was not bashing God. He
[2:38:28] was just speaking the depth of his
[2:38:30] heart.
[2:38:33] And sometime God want us to be
[2:38:35] desperately earnest with him.
[2:38:38] You can't flatter God. Tell him your
[2:38:41] heart.
[2:38:43] Tell him how you feel.
[2:38:45] [Music]
[2:38:50] He want us to be desperately earnest
[2:38:52] with him.
[2:38:56] I mean you telling God Lord you know you
[2:38:58] know you know you don't have to tell him
[2:39:02] you he knows he already knows.
[2:39:06] He want to know how how you think about
[2:39:08] your situation, how you feel about your
[2:39:11] situation.
[2:39:14] He want you to to speak it out to him.
[2:39:18] Be earnest
[2:39:22] and say, "Lord, come true for me."
[2:39:26] It's been too long.
[2:39:31] A closed mouth is a close destiny.
[2:39:35] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:39:39] You might just be moving in a death in a
[2:39:41] death march. Praise the Lord. Trying to
[2:39:44] figure things out by yourself, trying to
[2:39:46] solve your own problem. You might just
[2:39:48] be going in a death match.
[2:39:51] Praise the Lord.
[2:39:53] But one word from the Lord
[2:39:57] can solve our problem.
[2:40:01] Let's just bow our heads this afternoon.
[2:40:03] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we just
[2:40:05] want to thank you, Lord. Father, many
[2:40:08] times, Lord God, the the the the
[2:40:10] preacher comes, he labor in prayer, then
[2:40:12] labor in steady, Lord, with an
[2:40:14] inspiration on his heart, oh Father God,
[2:40:17] and and he brings the word to the
[2:40:19] people. Sometimes those words are
[2:40:21] scattered. Oh, Father God is preached,
[2:40:24] Lord. Father God, sometimes it looks
[2:40:26] like it goes over our head. Sometimes,
[2:40:29] oh, Father, we are there. We are trying
[2:40:31] to see where the preacher is going. We
[2:40:33] But Lord God, we know that God there is
[2:40:36] a spiritual body. There is a spiritual
[2:40:39] atmosphere. Oh father God. And Lord, we
[2:40:42] want to thank you for prophesying upon
[2:40:44] us, oh God, this afternoon. Thank you
[2:40:46] for speaking the word of life, oh God.
[2:40:49] Oh father, Lord Jesus. And we look to
[2:40:52] you, oh God, father, to materialize
[2:40:55] that, oh God, in the life of your
[2:40:57] children, oh father, Lord Jesus. Oh
[2:41:00] precious lamb of God father may the
[2:41:03] promises in your word create Lord may it
[2:41:06] create expectation in us oh father lord
[2:41:08] may those promises oh so father god in
[2:41:11] your word lord may change our mindset oh

[2:41:22] the praise we give you the glory and
[2:41:25] thank you father for the transforming
[2:41:27] power that is in your word, oh God.
[2:41:30] Father, Lord, it's not bringing us to
[2:41:32] something that we were not, Lord. It's
[2:41:34] bringing us right back to that image
[2:41:36] that we were in your mind. That's the
[2:41:38] reason why, Father, there is nothing
[2:41:40] that is above the word of God. There is
[2:41:43] no gift, there is no person, Father,
[2:41:45] Lord, nothing, oh God, and you give the
[2:41:48] church, you give the bride, the best
[2:41:50] thing when you give her the word, the
[2:41:52] best thing that we can ever have in this
[2:41:54] life is the word of God. Oh father Lord
[2:41:58] the revealed word of the hour Lord the
[2:42:00] spoken word by Malachi 4. Oh father God
