[12:05] brother steve oprah steve cassidy you're
[12:07] welcome sir
[12:23] god bless you god bless you saints
[12:25] um
[12:28] it was a few weeks back i believe was
[12:29] that i had requested a prayer
[12:32] i
[12:33] um
[12:34] it's a long story and i'll try to keep
[12:36] it brief but
[12:41] many years ago i was
[12:43] a criminal i'll just put it that way
[12:45] many years ago i was a criminal
[12:47] and
[12:50] back in 94
[12:53] i decided to
[12:56] um do what i could to make things right
[13:00] and so i went back to colorado that's
[13:03] where the
[13:04] the the crimes were committed
[13:06] and then went back to colorado to uh
[13:11] uh to confess
[13:14] to
[13:16] a homicide
[13:18] and
[13:21] um
[13:22] anyway
[13:23] the the way it worked out
[13:25] i i actually got an attorney i just you
[13:27] know i talked to a lot of people i
[13:28] didn't know what to do and i originally
[13:30] called someone here
[13:32] and they said well you got to talk to
[13:33] somebody in the county where it happened
[13:35] and so i ended up calling someone in the
[13:37] county
[13:38] uh
[13:39] and oddly enough the my attorney was an
[13:42] attorney that i had
[13:44] i'd been on a case where i was
[13:46] a i was a juror
[13:49] and i didn't like her
[13:51] and
[13:52] but i didn't know that until i
[13:54] got to colorado to see who my this
[13:57] person was i was talking to on the phone
[14:00] and um but she really was a good
[14:03] attorney
[14:04] and
[14:06] so the the d.a had offered me
[14:11] they offered me
[14:13] criminally negligent homicide
[14:15] which basically means that
[14:18] someone died in the process of a crime
[14:21] being committed
[14:23] and
[14:24] which was what it was and i thought well
[14:27] that's right and so but the uh
[14:31] i don't know if i'm not holding this
[14:32] close enough
[14:33] anyway the um
[14:38] so but the crime because it happened in
[14:41] 1977 in 1977 it was a misdemeanor
[14:46] and so the d.a you know
[14:48] it was a mistake the d.a wanted me to
[14:50] have a felony but what she offered me
[14:52] was a misdemeanor
[14:54] and i thought well but that's what it
[14:56] was and so i accepted it
[14:58] and then she couldn't take it back
[15:00] because i'd already talked to my
[15:02] attorney and i decided i was going to
[15:04] accept it
[15:05] so
[15:09] well then when i went to court
[15:12] and i didn't know this for
[15:14] 22 years i think it was
[15:17] it wasn't until five years ago
[15:20] that i was applying for a job
[15:22] and when i was applying for a job i was
[15:24] told that i couldn't
[15:27] get the job because i had a felony
[15:29] and i'm like well i don't have a felony
[15:32] and i thought it was really you know
[15:33] bizarre
[15:35] and there was a website i didn't go look
[15:38] at the website it just assumed that you
[15:40] know whoever did the background check
[15:42] knew what they saw
[15:43] and they said i had a felony and so i
[15:47] assumed that was right and
[15:49] and so i contacted him i didn't know
[15:51] what to do so i thought well let me
[15:52] contact my attorney well when i when i
[15:55] went to contact her she was not she was
[15:57] no longer an attorney
[15:58] she was a judge
[16:00] and she had been a judge for many years
[16:03] and
[16:04] so i i still contacted her and she she
[16:07] never got back to me but a clerk of
[16:09] court got back to me
[16:11] and he's you know he said that it had
[16:13] been all cleared up and everything and
[16:15] and i'd so i never looked at the i never
[16:17] went out the website to see it and i
[16:19] just so i assumed it was there and then
[16:21] i assumed that the clerk of court what
[16:23] he said was right so i just assumed
[16:25] everything was right
[16:27] well
[16:28] now it's been five years later
[16:31] and i was looking at a job i was
[16:33] thinking oh i wasn't really looking long
[16:35] story but
[16:36] i was thinking about applying for this
[16:38] one job but they said if you have a
[16:39] felony you cannot work for this company
[16:42] and i thought you know i probably should
[16:44] check and make sure i really don't have
[16:45] a felony
[16:46] so i actually went out to the website
[16:48] and i found out that i
[16:50] still had a felony on my record
[16:53] so then i went back i thought you know
[16:56] and i thought so i went online that's
[16:58] how i found my my former attorney in the
[17:00] first place so i went online
[17:02] and then i found out that she had
[17:04] retired so she was no longer a judge she
[17:07] retired
[17:08] um
[17:09] so i was i don't know if i really want
[17:11] to contact her why but i ended up i
[17:12] contacted again
[17:14] and
[17:16] she again she never got back to me and
[17:19] actually before i contacted her i
[17:20] contacted the clerk of court because i'd
[17:22] read that the clerk of court is the
[17:23] person who clears up your record
[17:26] so i contacted the clerk of court
[17:28] and the clerk of court
[17:30] uh
[17:31] forwarded my information to some
[17:33] self-help group it's like
[17:35] it made no sense at all so i called the
[17:37] the clerk court and she she wasn't there
[17:40] i left a long message she never called
[17:42] me back i never heard anything so then i
[17:44] thought well i'll go ahead and i'll send
[17:46] a letter to my former attorney
[17:49] and then when i did
[17:51] weeks had passed that's when i then
[17:52] that's when i had the prayer request
[17:55] that you know that the lord would
[17:56] intervene
[17:58] and then
[17:59] i finally got a call or not a call i got
[18:01] an email from the clerker court and she
[18:04] said that she'd received a letter and
[18:06] that she was gonna you know she'd be
[18:08] looking into it in the next week and
[18:09] then she'd get back to me
[18:11] and that's what happened and then she
[18:12] did get back to me she said that it was
[18:14] cleared up and i went out on the website
[18:17] and i no longer have a felony on my
[18:19] record so i just want to thank the lord
[18:21] for that
[18:32] thank you jesus let's shout glory
[18:35] indeed we're serving a living god
[18:38] we want to thank god for that wonderful

[52:48] praise the lord
[52:52] praise the lord what a wonderful jesus
[52:54] we serve
[52:56] amen
[52:58] so in john chapter 1
[53:02] sin john chapter 1.
[53:16] let's take seen john chapter one this
[53:19] morning
[53:23] i just i want to speak some on something
[53:25] this morning just to encourage us
[53:28] most especially
[53:30] with
[53:32] the time
[53:33] times that we are living in and the
[53:35] things that are happening around us
[53:37] i just thought that i should be able to
[53:42] remind us a few things from the word of
[53:44] the lord in john chapter one let's read
[53:46] verse one
[53:48] in the beginning
[53:49] was the word and the word
[53:52] was with god
[53:54] and the word was god
[53:57] praise the lord the same was in the
[53:59] beginning with god all things were made
[54:01] by him and without him was not anything
[54:05] made that was made
[54:07] amen
[54:09] praise the lord so uh let's let's take
[54:11] another verse here
[54:13] over
[54:14] in the in the book of hebrew
[54:20] let's take uh hebrew chapter
[54:23] 11
[54:29] hebrew
[54:30] chapter 11
[54:35] praise the lord
[54:37] amen
[54:42] hebrew chapter 11 let's read verse 1 as
[54:46] well
[54:48] now faith is the substance of things
[54:50] hopeful the evidence of things not seen
[54:54] for by it the other obtained a good
[54:57] report
[54:59] true faith we understand
[55:03] that the words were framed by the word
[55:06] of god
[55:09] so that things which are seen
[55:13] were not made of things which do
[55:17] appear
[55:19] praise the lord
[55:21] amen
[55:22] and then hebrew chapter 4
[55:31] hebrew chapter 4
[55:34] we want to take
[55:36] one of the verse
[55:38] that would be verse 12.
[55:48] verse 12
[55:50] for the word of god is quick
[55:54] and powerful
[55:57] and sharper
[55:59] than any two-edged sword piercing
[56:03] even to the dividing asunder
[56:06] of spirit and soul
[56:09] and of the joints and the marron and is
[56:12] at the center
[56:14] of the thoughts
[56:16] and the intents
[56:18] of the heart
[56:20] neither is there any creature
[56:23] that
[56:24] is not manifest in his sight
[56:27] so in the sight of the word of god
[56:30] nothing is hate
[56:32] neither is there any creature that is
[56:35] now manifest in his sight
[56:38] but all things
[56:40] are naked
[56:41] and open
[56:43] unto the eyes of him
[56:45] with whom
[56:47] we have to do
[56:49] so i will ask you this morning who are
[56:51] you dealing with
[56:54] to him to whom
[56:56] we have to do
[56:58] let's pray heavenly father
[57:00] we will ask your blessings
[57:02] upon the portion of your word that we
[57:04] have read
[57:05] father for one reason
[57:08] we are gathered here

[57:28] that will draw us closer to you

[59:42] and
[59:43] then uh yesterday also i spoke with uh
[59:49] [Music]
[59:51] brother moses
[59:53] there's uh
[59:55] but moses in kansas uh he have come true

[1:00:09] his his father also went to be with the
[1:00:12] lord so we will remember these brothers
[1:00:15] and the many that uh
[1:00:17] that are mourning they are lost that the
[1:00:19] lord will comfort them
[1:00:22] praise the lord
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:30] so uh this morning
[1:00:32] uh
[1:00:33] we want to
[1:00:35] just like i said we want to encourage
[1:00:37] ourselves we want to uh uh you know talk
[1:00:40] on something just to encourage us for
[1:00:44] the time
[1:00:45] you know that we uh we are living in
[1:00:47] i want i want to focus a little bit on
[1:00:49] the on the word of god
[1:00:51] this scripture did in
[1:00:53] uh hebrew chapter 12 caught my attention
[1:00:57] for the word is quick
[1:01:01] and powerful
[1:01:03] i don't know how much
[1:01:04] power
[1:01:05] that we know that the word of god has
[1:01:09] but we want to talk a little bit about
[1:01:10] that this morning how the word of god is
[1:01:13] quick
[1:01:14] and powerful
[1:01:16] you believe that the word of god is
[1:01:17] powerful we just read from hebrew
[1:01:20] chapter 11 by the word of god
[1:01:22] the heaven and earth was created
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:28] things which do appear
[1:01:31] things that we see with our eyes the
[1:01:34] trees
[1:01:35] and
[1:01:37] were all
[1:01:39] created
[1:01:40] by
[1:01:41] a spoken word by a word that god spoke
[1:01:45] so we want to stand with the apostle
[1:01:47] paul this morning and says the word of
[1:01:50] god is powerful
[1:01:52] but before we get to talking there
[1:01:56] uh
[1:01:58] i want to i want to take
[1:02:04] i want to take an experience here uh
[1:02:06] from the message paradox
[1:02:09] uh that uh brother branham had
[1:02:12] and it was it was uh more like a dream
[1:02:15] or the vision that he had
[1:02:17] and and the vision
[1:02:20] was was something like
[1:02:23] going across jordan
[1:02:27] where
[1:02:28] the promises laid
[1:02:30] we know that god
[1:02:33] his children
[1:02:34] you know uh a land that was flooring
[1:02:37] with milk and honey he promised them uh
[1:02:40] their inheritance he was going to bring
[1:02:42] them out of bunish and take them over to
[1:02:45] their inheritance so
[1:02:47] across jordan was where
[1:02:50] the the promises
[1:02:52] was laying but
[1:02:54] while they were on this other side of
[1:02:56] jordan
[1:02:57] they they they experienced miracle there
[1:03:00] were manna falling from heaven you know
[1:03:02] when and god turned the the water of
[1:03:05] mirror into sweet water and and and the
[1:03:08] pillow of fire was leading them they saw
[1:03:10] the opening of the red sea and
[1:03:13] everything but they are inheritance was
[1:03:16] lying across jordan praise the lord
[1:03:20] so uh
[1:03:22] uh i want to take this experience uh i
[1:03:25] read a little bit to you i might i might
[1:03:27] escape quickly and just to uh to get to
[1:03:31] the point here
[1:03:32] so it was it was uh it came
[1:03:35] just like a dream or like a vision that
[1:03:38] he had but that was what it was it was
[1:03:41] all potential it seems like
[1:03:45] i could hear a song
[1:03:48] going down to jordan someone was singing
[1:03:51] and as i drove near the river i looked
[1:03:54] back and and and
[1:03:56] and seeing which way i had come
[1:04:00] and
[1:04:02] was two-thirds of the way to jordan and
[1:04:04] i looked across jordan and i said oh
[1:04:07] praise god
[1:04:09] just on the other side
[1:04:11] is where
[1:04:12] all the promises lays
[1:04:15] every promised land
[1:04:17] in the promised land
[1:04:20] praise the lord and we know our promises
[1:04:23] is laying in the holy ghost amen
[1:04:26] there's were our promises
[1:04:28] god put all his promises right in there
[1:04:32] and it seems like everybody was afraid
[1:04:36] what's everybody so afraid of
[1:04:41] and the voice came to me and said there
[1:04:44] is such a danger in these days
[1:04:47] there's a great
[1:04:50] hydro stain
[1:04:51] there's death
[1:04:53] when it distracts you
[1:04:57] and i believe the other uh you know that
[1:05:00] we we are just using this to be able to
[1:05:03] to uh set ourselves up yes set a stage
[1:05:06] for us to talk about the things that we
[1:05:08] want to talk about but i believe we are
[1:05:11] we are living in such such a time also
[1:05:14] where everybody is afraid
[1:05:16] and uh and and i mean there are things
[1:05:19] that are happening uh it's hardly to go
[1:05:22] a day when there is not a kind of deaf
[1:05:25] news if it is not suicide it's uh it's
[1:05:28] uh it's homicide if it is not homoside
[1:05:31] it's some kind of a killing or shooting
[1:05:34] or you know horrible things that are
[1:05:36] happening all around the world praise
[1:05:40] the lord
[1:05:41] it looks like it's just every word and
[1:05:44] people are just afraid
[1:05:46] amen
[1:05:47] there is such a danger
[1:05:49] in these days that we are living
[1:05:52] praise the lord
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:57] and then in the vision it was more like
[1:06:00] this danger was about a mamba snake
[1:06:03] that was moving in the weeds
[1:06:06] and
[1:06:08] and we know that same old
[1:06:11] devil
[1:06:12] praise the lord
[1:06:13] they are all serpent according to
[1:06:16] revelation chapter 12 is moving in these
[1:06:18] days amen
[1:06:19] praise the lord and he's the one that is
[1:06:21] causing death he's the one that is
[1:06:23] causing fear
[1:06:25] he's the one that is causing all of the
[1:06:28] evil that we are seeing in our day in
[1:06:31] our time
[1:06:33] praise the lord
[1:06:35] and then there in the vision it was it

[1:11:50] and on and read but uh uh
[1:11:56] i want us to look at this because i
[1:11:58] think

[1:12:01] that is causing our age to be
[1:12:04] the way it is
[1:12:05] we have a government that is not sincere
[1:12:08] to the people
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:11] and
[1:12:12] we have uh uh uh i mean even even
[1:12:16] our church leaders
[1:12:18] uh uh i mean
[1:12:20] insincerity is one of
[1:12:24] the evil in our day
[1:12:26] praise the lord
[1:12:28] amen and even as the church of the
[1:12:30] living god that is one of the things
[1:12:33] that is robbing us
[1:12:35] from the blessings that we must be
[1:12:36] enjoying that's one of the things that
[1:12:39] is causing a hindrance to our prayers
[1:12:42] is
[1:12:42] the lack of sincerity
[1:12:45] praise the lord
[1:12:47] amen
[1:12:49] the lack of sincerity
[1:12:51] and i pray that
[1:12:54] the lord will be able to help us as we
[1:12:57] as we talk about this
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:02] so we have this thing we have promises
[1:13:05] that are lying right across jordan
[1:13:08] and uh uh
[1:13:12] in those promises
[1:13:14] blessings i promise to us for us to
[1:13:17] enjoy
[1:13:19] but
[1:13:20] how how can we
[1:13:22] you know
[1:13:23] unless we are sincere
[1:13:26] glory be to god
[1:13:28] and because of the lack of sincerity
[1:13:30] we've seen a lot of people that are
[1:13:32] holding this bible under the army and
[1:13:34] people even in the message homes
[1:13:38] and uh
[1:13:40] it's it's uh it's a sad thing
[1:13:43] to even think about and said you know
[1:13:45] and see how many marriages that is just
[1:13:47] slipping from under the people even
[1:13:50] ministers have been preaching this
[1:13:52] message their wives walking away you
[1:13:54] know going into wilderness
[1:13:56] and and i just believe is because we
[1:13:59] have not been sincere
[1:14:02] we have just hold a title on our chest
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:07] we practiced the dress code
[1:14:10] we learned the language
[1:14:12] the prophet said the message those are
[1:14:14] the major vocabularies
[1:14:18] but we have not been sincere
[1:14:24] and because of sincerity children's have
[1:14:27] been slaughtered
[1:14:28] on the altar of insincerity
[1:14:37] praise the lord
[1:14:39] the word of god is powerful
[1:14:41] that's that's what uh the bible say

[1:15:04] david said in psalm chapter 147
[1:15:08] verse
[1:15:08] 15

[1:15:17] runeth very swiftly
[1:15:21] when the bible says the word of god is
[1:15:24] quick
[1:15:26] it run it very swiftly
[1:15:31] praise the lord you remember when i when
[1:15:33] when elijah the prophet
[1:15:36] came after he told ahab that there would
[1:15:38] be no rain
[1:15:40] until ah the lord god called for it
[1:15:44] praise the lord
[1:15:45] and and then after the three and a half
[1:15:48] years when elijah came back and and have

[1:16:06] that it was going to rain you know the

[1:16:18] to get up there
[1:16:21] down to uh jerusalem or the city of
[1:16:24] samira wherever the word but you will
[1:16:26] realize that elijah being the prophet of
[1:16:30] god he was more
[1:16:32] swifter than ahab that he was he ahab

[1:17:15] and because the word
[1:17:18] is a living word
[1:17:23] the word of god
[1:17:24] the bible says in the beginning was the
[1:17:26] word
[1:17:28] the word was with god and the word
[1:17:32] was god
[1:17:33] the word actually is god
[1:17:39] praise the lord
[1:17:41] amen the word actually is god
[1:17:45] the word of god is is almost like uh uh
[1:17:49] like i've said before this is is like a
[1:17:52] uh

[1:18:02] with a football in his hands
[1:18:04] and he spin the ball in the air across
[1:18:07] the feet and is able to run and receive
[1:18:11] he's that he's the troyer and he's the
[1:18:13] receiver
[1:18:15] that's how god is to his word
[1:18:18] when god speak his word he's already on

[1:18:32] and the word
[1:18:33] is powerful
[1:18:36] praise the lord
[1:18:38] the word of god is powerful
[1:18:46] if we would just consider that
[1:18:49] if we would just consider
[1:18:51] the
[1:18:52] characteristics the ability
[1:18:56] that the word of god
[1:18:59] has that possess
[1:19:02] amen
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] the word of god is alive
[1:19:16] when god's word comes alive in an
[1:19:19] individual lives
[1:19:21] it pierces right through the sinful
[1:19:23] attitude and bad habits and wrong
[1:19:26] thinking
[1:19:28] more than just being alive
[1:19:31] god's word is powerful
[1:19:36] it is constantly active
[1:19:41] just like god showed during the time of
[1:19:43] creation
[1:19:44] every day
[1:19:46] god was doing something he says let
[1:19:48] there be
[1:19:50] and the next day then god said let there
[1:19:52] be and the next day and god said let it
[1:19:54] be
[1:19:55] god's word is active
[1:19:58] he's always working on something
[1:20:01] it does things to us that nothing else
[1:20:04] can do
[1:20:05] it touch us where nothing can reach
[1:20:09] god's word
[1:20:11] has in itself
[1:20:13] sufficient energy
[1:20:15] and motivation motivational force to
[1:20:18] affect
[1:20:19] spiritual action
[1:20:23] praise the lord
[1:20:26] when it is brought to the attention of
[1:20:28] god's people
[1:20:33] paul say the word of god is quake
[1:20:35] it's powerful
[1:20:39] it's sharper
[1:20:41] praise the lord
[1:20:43] those that experience divine healing of
[1:20:46] cancer
[1:20:48] being removed from the alums and tumor
[1:20:51] from their stomach and and different
[1:20:54] experience of divine healing that they
[1:20:56] have experienced
[1:20:59] and what remove those sicknesses is the
[1:21:03] word of god
[1:21:06] the word of god is so sharp
[1:21:09] that it can cut
[1:21:11] a tumor from somebody
[1:21:14] and there will be no scar
[1:21:20] the word of god is so sharp
[1:21:22] that it can get there and even cut
[1:21:25] habits from our life
[1:21:29] and you can trace it
[1:21:34] praise the lord
[1:21:36] that's how powerful
[1:21:38] like paul said the one that we have to
[1:21:41] do the one that we are dealing with
[1:21:44] that's how powerful he is
[1:21:46] but you see religion and church and
[1:21:49] denomination and all the different
[1:21:51] reforms that have come through the ages
[1:21:54] have only limited us to to deny to man's
[1:21:58] idea
[1:22:00] of who this almighty all powerful god is
[1:22:09] praise the lord
[1:22:12] and now we look at the creator of the
[1:22:14] heavenly earth
[1:22:16] through a church idea or a church
[1:22:18] teaching
[1:22:21] but almighty god
[1:22:23] that had never forsake his people
[1:22:26] in every age he has always made a way
[1:22:31] to bring
[1:22:33] himself real to make himself
[1:22:36] real praise the lord
[1:22:41] he will always do something
[1:22:45] to prove to his people
[1:22:48] that he's a he's a he's a living god
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:58] paul says the word pierces
[1:23:01] we have knife and razor sharp enough
[1:23:04] to pierce any material
[1:23:07] with hardly any effort at all
[1:23:11] we can cut a piece of paper
[1:23:14] there are misers
[1:23:16] there can peer steel plates in concrete
[1:23:19] world
[1:23:21] but only this book the word of god god's
[1:23:25] truth
[1:23:26] is able to pierce into the spiritual
[1:23:29] life
[1:23:30] of an individual
[1:23:32] we're not even as sergeant
[1:23:35] sharp staple
[1:23:37] can reach
[1:23:42] this world has the place to travel
[1:23:47] when the doctor cannot find it
[1:23:51] when the doctor uses all his instrument
[1:23:55] and he searched and he said we cannot
[1:23:57] find it we don't know what happened this
[1:24:00] word is able to travel
[1:24:04] like paul says in the dividing asunder
[1:24:14] and is able to get to the place
[1:24:17] where the doctor's staple cannot reach
[1:24:26] praise the lord
[1:24:31] the word of god is quick it's powerful
[1:24:35] it's sharper than the two-edged sword
[1:24:37] piercing
[1:24:39] even to the dividing asunder
[1:24:41] of the spirit
[1:24:43] and the soul
[1:24:45] praise the lord
[1:24:48] for the matter of fact is only the word
[1:24:51] that can heal the spirit
[1:24:53] no doctor can heal your spirit
[1:24:57] amen all the medical signs i've ever
[1:25:00] learned to do
[1:25:02] only stop on this body
[1:25:06] no doctor can heal your spirit
[1:25:09] no doctor can deliver your soul
[1:25:12] only the word of god has the ability
[1:25:16] to heal your spirit
[1:25:18] solomon said in the book of proverbs
[1:25:23] he says
[1:25:25] a broken spirit
[1:25:27] who can heal
[1:25:31] praise the lord
[1:25:33] only the word of god
[1:25:35] is able
[1:25:36] to get down when your emotion
[1:25:39] has been broken
[1:25:41] whether by deception
[1:25:44] all by lives
[1:25:45] it's only this world
[1:25:47] that has the ability to step in there
[1:25:52] and heal you
[1:25:56] praise the lord
[1:26:00] oh let the lord help us this morning
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:09] even wave the
[1:26:11] the brilliance
[1:26:12] of
[1:26:13] the brain surgeon people that work on
[1:26:16] nails the nervous system and all of that
[1:26:19] the spine
[1:26:22] they cannot touch your spirit
[1:26:25] that is god's reign
[1:26:27] it's a ram that only god
[1:26:31] can deal with
[1:26:33] praise the lord
[1:26:34] and when we come to church
[1:26:37] as we are this morning
[1:26:40] we are here to deal
[1:26:42] with things beyond the flesh
[1:26:47] praise the lord
[1:26:49] we hear
[1:26:51] that god
[1:26:53] will be able to use his word
[1:26:55] and address things in our spirit man
[1:27:00] and and he can be able to get right in
[1:27:02] there
[1:27:04] and and correct things
[1:27:09] cast out
[1:27:10] spirits
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:14] that's the purpose why we come to the
[1:27:16] house of the lord
[1:27:18] glory be to god
[1:27:20] so i mean with with uh with the danger
[1:27:24] that we described from very brand
[1:27:26] invasion
[1:27:28] that we have in the land and then the
[1:27:30] things that are happening
[1:27:34] and with the word also that god has
[1:27:36] given to us
[1:27:38] the prophet god said in the church ages
[1:27:40] he says i wonder
[1:27:43] have the people realize the ministry
[1:27:46] that god has given us in this age
[1:27:49] how much important have we realized why
[1:27:52] god has to send a son of man ministry
[1:28:00] praise the lord
[1:28:01] it's now for us to build doctrines and
[1:28:03] build churches
[1:28:05] it's for god to be able because he says
[1:28:08] the end time message will address the
[1:28:10] end time problems
[1:28:14] and we meet the challenges of this age
[1:28:18] and no matter how dark it was in egypt
[1:28:22] god provided a gushing for his people
[1:28:26] the bible says in the book of exodus
[1:28:28] that the darkness in egypt could be felt
[1:28:33] that's right
[1:28:34] the darkness could be felt
[1:28:37] and i believe that we are living in the
[1:28:39] same ancient time where this darkness
[1:28:43] you know isaiah says gross darkness will
[1:28:46] be upon the people the darkness is that
[1:28:48] the darkness that is around us can be
[1:28:50] felt
[1:28:53] when a community like this experience
[1:28:55] what we have just experienced everybody
[1:28:57] can feed it
[1:28:59] and because we can feed it that's why we
[1:29:01] were not here on wednesday
[1:29:08] night praise the lord
[1:29:13] but yet also god provided
[1:29:17] a light he provided a city of light a
[1:29:20] place that was called goshen
[1:29:23] that his children the hebrews also
[1:29:27] they could see the sense of darkness on
[1:29:30] the other side but yet also they can
[1:29:33] experience the presence of light
[1:29:38] praise the lord
[1:29:39] because it takes a terrible sense of
[1:29:43] darkness
[1:29:44] for you to appreciate
[1:29:46] the light
[1:29:51] glory be to god
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:55] and that's the time that we are living
[1:29:57] in that's the age that we are living in
[1:30:01] we have all of these things happening
[1:30:03] around us
[1:30:05] but just like i said i just i just want
[1:30:07] to encourage you this morning
[1:30:10] i want to encourage you
[1:30:13] that this word that you have in your
[1:30:15] hands
[1:30:17] what are you reading out of your bible
[1:30:19] you read it out of your cell phone or
[1:30:21] your ipod wherever you read it from
[1:30:26] those are not just made man's word
[1:30:32] this is the word of the very god that
[1:30:35] created you
[1:30:36] amen the birth that you breathe comes
[1:30:39] from this
[1:30:41] that's why jesus said men shall not live
[1:30:44] by bread alone
[1:30:45] but by every word
[1:30:47] that comes from the mouth of god
[1:30:51] praise the lord
[1:30:53] our own
[1:30:54] souls of
[1:30:57] strength
[1:31:00] amen
[1:31:02] and our place of refuge is this word
[1:31:06] praise the lord
[1:31:08] young people church i want to encourage
[1:31:10] you don't play with the word of god
[1:31:14] don't play with the word of god
[1:31:16] because just like paul said let every
[1:31:18] man be a liar
[1:31:20] god
[1:31:21] word remains truth
[1:31:25] praise the lord
[1:31:27] amen if we really believe this word it
[1:31:30] will prove us truth
[1:31:34] but if you think you really believe the
[1:31:36] word
[1:31:38] and
[1:31:40] it does not seems like
[1:31:42] what you think you believe is happening
[1:31:45] in your life the problem is not the word
[1:31:49] the problem it's you
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:56] praise the lord
[1:31:57] because when god said let there be light
[1:32:00] no matter how long it talked
[1:32:03] you and myself was not there but we can
[1:32:06] see the skies we can see the moon we can
[1:32:09] see the sun so it's not difficult for us
[1:32:11] to believe that god said let there be
[1:32:13] light
[1:32:15] we were not there we never knew how long
[1:32:18] it took but yeah we have light
[1:32:21] yes
[1:32:22] praise the lord
[1:32:27] the word of god is quick
[1:32:33] that's the reason why the psalmist said
[1:32:34] his word is settled
[1:32:38] because his word is quake when god speak
[1:32:41] his word when he promised his word
[1:32:45] to god is already done and settled
[1:32:51] we can argue about it
[1:32:55] we can find the greek the hebrew the
[1:32:57] aramaic we can argue but to god
[1:33:00] his promised word is already settled and
[1:33:04] done
[1:33:05] if god said he will have a bride a
[1:33:07] people without spot or wrinkle to god
[1:33:11] it's already done
[1:33:14] if god said there will be a rapture
[1:33:17] to god it's settled and gone
[1:33:22] praise the lord
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:26] thank you jesus
[1:33:28] glory be to god
[1:33:32] amen
[1:33:33] one of the things that have destroyed us
[1:33:36] is the insincerity
[1:33:39] is the insincerity to what
[1:33:42] we believe
[1:33:46] praise the lord
[1:33:47] the insincerity
[1:33:51] and oh may god help us
[1:33:53] praise the lord
[1:33:55] may god help us
[1:33:57] i will go into something now like i said
[1:33:59] i just just want to encourage you
[1:34:01] you know this uh this morning
[1:34:04] so don't take the word of god lightly
[1:34:07] don't play with it
[1:34:09] praise the lord
[1:34:11] don't play with it that's the only thing
[1:34:13] that your soul needs to live
[1:34:17] it's the word of god
[1:34:19] your burger king and king burger and
[1:34:22] and roasted chicken you are eating your
[1:34:24] soul does not live out of faith
[1:34:28] it's good for your body
[1:34:30] but the only thing that is man's soul we
[1:34:32] live on is the word of god
[1:34:34] praise the lord
[1:34:35] and the more you feel on that word the
[1:34:38] more the god of heaven and earth become
[1:34:39] real to you
[1:34:42] the more you feed on that word the more
[1:34:44] you take god's word serious and realize
[1:34:47] that god does not his promises does not
[1:34:50] have problems
[1:34:53] praise the lord
[1:34:55] if there will be anything that has
[1:34:56] problem i i have problems
[1:35:01] because i'm born in sin and shipley in
[1:35:03] iniquity i need that word to change me
[1:35:19] i was i was uh
[1:35:24] praise the lord
[1:35:25] amen
[1:35:27] glory be to god
[1:35:29] you know sometimes there are things that
[1:35:31] that just sticks on your mind and and
[1:35:34] it's just hard for you to get out of it
[1:35:36] and it's it's wonderful this morning
[1:35:38] that's what i'm preaching the way i'm
[1:35:39] preaching so just bear with me amen
[1:35:43] amen i might not be too emotional this
[1:35:45] morning like other times but just bear
[1:35:47] with me
[1:35:48] praise the lord
[1:35:51] and we see all of these things happening
[1:35:54] you know
[1:35:55] around the christian church
[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:01] mega churches they have built their
[1:36:03] church on on music and then and build
[1:36:07] their church on disco light and build
[1:36:09] their church on preaching popular gospel
[1:36:13] even because they have played with the
[1:36:15] word of god
[1:36:18] all their institute are all crumbling
[1:36:21] down
[1:36:24] praise the lord
[1:36:27] man that has handled this word
[1:36:30] and most of the people
[1:36:33] that are having problem with the word
[1:36:35] with the message of the hour
[1:36:37] if it's not the word of god
[1:36:40] their problem the the serious problem is
[1:36:42] their insincerity
[1:36:45] their insincerity has created a lot of
[1:36:48] questions
[1:36:49] in their
[1:36:50] mind
[1:36:52] i'll give you an example
[1:36:56] one of my
[1:36:58] good
[1:36:59] gospel singers he used to be a gospel
[1:37:01] singer
[1:37:02] and uh
[1:37:06] very good gospel singer
[1:37:09] and then he started struggling
[1:37:12] with same-sex attraction
[1:37:16] and then he he sang a song
[1:37:19] that's from his own testimony he signed
[1:37:22] the song this is what the altar is for
[1:37:26] and in his mind this is what he said
[1:37:30] the inspiration of that song was
[1:37:34] whatever he was struggling with inside
[1:37:37] he go to the altar to pray that's what
[1:37:39] the altar is for
[1:37:41] i bring it to the altar i give it to you
[1:37:43] lord but when he leaves he still lives
[1:37:46] with the same thing and over the years
[1:37:49] he'd been struggling and in his mind but
[1:37:52] that's what the altar is for i come to
[1:37:54] the altar i confess my sin
[1:37:59] but that's not what the word of god says
[1:38:02] praise the lord he had a wife and
[1:38:05] children that did not know he was
[1:38:06] struggling with that
[1:38:09] the bible says you cannot leave the one
[1:38:12] that you have offended and go to the
[1:38:15] altar to make a sacrifice it is being
[1:38:18] sacrificed god will not accept that
[1:38:21] you have someone very close to you that
[1:38:23] you could have confessed and said this
[1:38:25] is what i'm struggling with
[1:38:31] it's the insincerity
[1:38:34] now you you are blaming god i come to
[1:38:36] the altar lord i confess my sin oh
[1:38:39] father have mercy upon me
[1:38:41] when god in his word
[1:38:44] told you
[1:38:48] that you can't jump over
[1:38:50] that order
[1:38:53] you can have something against somebody
[1:38:58] and then come to the altar now you come
[1:39:00] to the altar you are expecting god to
[1:39:02] deliver you
[1:39:04] if you just follow that simple
[1:39:06] instruction
[1:39:10] that simple instruction
[1:39:14] of leaving your sacrifice at the altar
[1:39:18] go and meet the one
[1:39:20] that you have problem with
[1:39:24] you see what i'm talking about the word
[1:39:26] of god is powerful
[1:39:29] but yet the word can also be helpless
[1:39:36] when you don't follow the other
[1:39:40] praise the lord it can help you because
[1:39:43] you are enough you are robbing god of
[1:39:45] the power to deliver you
[1:39:57] are we together
[1:40:03] praise the lord
[1:40:12] you know you study the word of god you
[1:40:13] read the message yeah brother i'm
[1:40:15] talking about
[1:40:16] acts chapter 5.
[1:40:18] he addressed the situation there of
[1:40:20] ananias and so far
[1:40:22] and over and over he says
[1:40:25] uh you know as chapter five we'll come
[1:40:27] back to the church again
[1:40:29] you know and out of there but one of the
[1:40:31] things that uh we we look at when we
[1:40:33] think about us chapter five we look at
[1:40:36] in our mind we think about the the the
[1:40:39] the the judgment we think about you know
[1:40:42] god striking ananias and so far dead
[1:40:48] but have we paused a little bit and go
[1:40:50] back and see what were they dealing with
[1:40:54] what was their problem
[1:40:58] what was their problem
[1:41:00] and i don't believe that their problem
[1:41:02] was just that
[1:41:04] their service
[1:41:08] amen
[1:41:09] there is a problem of insincerity that
[1:41:12] has been in their home
[1:41:15] the wife has been covering the husband
[1:41:17] the husband being covering the wife
[1:41:21] they don't agree with one another yet
[1:41:23] they are bearing with one another and
[1:41:25] they know that
[1:41:27] praise the lord amen glory be to god
[1:41:39] and that's the thing
[1:41:41] that is
[1:41:43] killing
[1:41:45] kill him
[1:41:46] now remember brother branham says
[1:41:48] you know they will come back to the
[1:41:50] church
[1:41:51] and i think that we have
[1:41:54] mishones to that court
[1:41:57] we're looking for the day where
[1:42:00] husband and wife will be dropping dead
[1:42:02] in the church they're already dead
[1:42:07] they are already dead
[1:42:09] their insincerity has taken god from
[1:42:11] their presence
[1:42:15] and they are going from one era to
[1:42:17] another era
[1:42:21] praise the lord
[1:42:25] amen
[1:42:35] a situation
[1:42:38] was brought to me and i was talking
[1:42:43] and i just fed i says well i have to
[1:42:45] look into this and you know prayed about
[1:42:47] it you know your heart goes out for
[1:42:48] people and you say oh god how can this
[1:42:51] beat and and wide and you know and and
[1:42:54] you just you are just you are just so
[1:42:56] touching your heart and want to help the
[1:42:58] situation
[1:43:00] and uh
[1:43:03] as i talk
[1:43:05] to some of the parties that are in the
[1:43:07] situation
[1:43:08] i realized that we have a problem on our
[1:43:11] hand
[1:43:12] praise the lord
[1:43:15] and i'm telling you that thing frees me
[1:43:19] it frees me
[1:43:21] because i did not even i never even i
[1:43:24] was not even looking at it like that
[1:43:26] until i started talking to the pastor of
[1:43:28] the church
[1:43:29] and then as we talked
[1:43:32] i just i just saw that i said bro this
[1:43:34] is what i think it is this is the
[1:43:36] problem that we have on our hand
[1:43:40] praise the lord
[1:43:42] amen
[1:43:47] oh may god help us people
[1:43:50] amen may he help us especially with the
[1:43:54] time that we are living in we are
[1:43:55] talking about a rapture we're talking
[1:43:57] about about the change
[1:44:00] those are not just slogan
[1:44:03] it's going to be the power of god
[1:44:05] in the midst of the church
[1:44:07] that is going to wake up the people
[1:44:09] to such an expectation
[1:44:17] praise the lord
[1:44:21] with all of the things that are
[1:44:22] happening around us
[1:44:26] how our sons and daughters of god
[1:44:30] we have to be equate
[1:44:33] you know people can use excuse and say
[1:44:35] so you know what a lot of people use use
[1:44:38] cove excuse now to come to church
[1:44:43] and all of that
[1:44:46] all we know there's a real situation i
[1:44:48] mean that's the reason why we take all
[1:44:50] of the the
[1:44:52] the
[1:44:54] precaution
[1:44:55] you know we got ourselves and everything
[1:44:58] but the truth about the macho dead is
[1:45:00] that
[1:45:02] we serve a god that is greater
[1:45:04] amen
[1:45:06] amen
[1:45:07] we serve a god that is greater
[1:45:11] praise the lord
[1:45:14] amen
[1:45:15] and we believe that as long as we do the
[1:45:18] right thing
[1:45:19] and have faith in god he's going to take
[1:45:21] care of us
[1:45:27] praise the lord
[1:45:29] amen
[1:45:31] and i mean it's the same
[1:45:37] you know people goes to work and then
[1:45:39] and those people down there in indiana
[1:45:41] police went to work out at the feathers
[1:45:44] place trying to work and take care of
[1:45:46] your family
[1:45:52] yeah the man comes in and and
[1:45:54] you know and and starts to shoot
[1:45:56] shooting and takes people life i mean
[1:45:59] it's it's such a day and such a time
[1:46:01] that we are living in
[1:46:02] and that is the thing that brings us to
[1:46:05] the place where we have to realize
[1:46:09] what if i'm caught up in one of this
[1:46:10] situation
[1:46:13] praise the lord where am i with where am
[1:46:15] i with god
[1:46:17] am i sincere enough
[1:46:24] praise the lord
[1:46:32] and all of these things
[1:46:37] but i mean this is just a wake-up call
[1:46:39] church
[1:46:40] praise the lord
[1:46:42] this is just a wake-up call
[1:46:45] let's read another quote down here from
[1:46:48] from paradox
[1:46:50] i have often wanted to come into a
[1:46:53] church i've longed to see it i guess
[1:46:56] where i could walk
[1:46:58] in the back door front door wherever it
[1:47:00] was look across the audience
[1:47:03] and see
[1:47:05] a perfect church all in order now that
[1:47:08] perfect church is not all about sinless
[1:47:12] perfection
[1:47:14] it's a church where the people are
[1:47:17] disciplined by the word of god
[1:47:19] that's why he says the church all in
[1:47:21] other
[1:47:22] a church where people come to church to
[1:47:25] worship god they come to church because
[1:47:29] they want to worship god and get into
[1:47:31] the word of god
[1:47:38] praise the lord
[1:47:43] he says an audience and see a perfect
[1:47:45] church all in order sin couldn't
[1:47:48] stealthy
[1:47:49] no the spirit will call it out
[1:47:53] it just wouldn't stay there like ananias
[1:47:56] and so far he says uh uh
[1:47:59] that there be seen in there in that
[1:48:02] group
[1:48:02] and the spirit quickly
[1:48:04] speak
[1:48:06] it like that
[1:48:08] no matter what it was how little
[1:48:12] it would be done
[1:48:13] amen
[1:48:14] see
[1:48:15] women men sitting there under the power
[1:48:19] of the holy spirit
[1:48:22] the spirit of god moving perfectly
[1:48:28] not just doing our religious duty and i
[1:48:32] mean we are so on the edge of our
[1:48:34] seating and we have we have so much
[1:48:36] important things to do
[1:48:39] well if you have it to do please excuse
[1:48:41] us
[1:48:43] praise the
[1:48:44] lord if you have important things to do
[1:48:47] we appreciate you coming we love you
[1:48:49] amen
[1:48:55] glory be to god
[1:49:00] but men and women sitting under the
[1:49:03] moving of the power of the holy spirit
[1:49:06] the spirit of god moving perfectly
[1:49:08] moving this someone has done something
[1:49:10] wrong in the congregation
[1:49:14] did they come quickly then confess it
[1:49:18] praise the lord
[1:49:19] now to the pastor
[1:49:21] make the heart right with god
[1:49:24] because he is the one that you have you
[1:49:26] have to deal with and you know the truth
[1:49:28] about the mata there is that every one
[1:49:31] of us think that we are sincere is god
[1:49:33] awaits sincerity
[1:49:38] sincerity is now weighed on how much you
[1:49:40] think you are sincere
[1:49:45] it's god that wages the spirit of man
[1:49:53] praise the lord
[1:49:56] oh what a church we'll have
[1:50:00] praise the lord what a church
[1:50:04] if we have our hearts all up to god and
[1:50:07] say oh god have mercy lord forgive me
[1:50:10] and we make sure that
[1:50:12] what what a service we will have
[1:50:16] praise the lord
[1:50:37] i mean it's the time that we are living
[1:50:39] in people
[1:50:41] we are living in a time where god
[1:50:45] is looking for there from his children
[1:50:51] it's looking for death from his children
[1:50:54] if we can just be sincere
[1:50:57] he knows
[1:50:59] our strength
[1:51:01] he knows our weaknesses
[1:51:04] like we always say you can't impress him
[1:51:06] because he have seen too much
[1:51:09] praise the lord
[1:51:11] you can impress him
[1:51:13] and you also can discourage him
[1:51:17] because he knows exactly where you are
[1:51:21] and the good news is that he's willing
[1:51:24] to help you
[1:51:27] if you would just be sincere he's
[1:51:29] willing to reach down and pick you
[1:51:32] up because his thoughts concerning you
[1:51:37] another thought of evil he starts
[1:51:39] concerning you is not for you to be
[1:51:41] defeated
[1:51:42] his thought is for you to be victorious
[1:51:46] but he don't want you to pretend about
[1:51:48] it
[1:51:50] no he don't want you to pretend about it
[1:51:52] he don't want us to pretend about it
[1:51:59] we must come just as we are
[1:52:02] and he can pick us up from there
[1:52:10] praise the lord
[1:52:14] oh my goodness
[1:52:18] praise the lord
[1:52:20] but one it looks like current ran
[1:52:22] through your body just now
[1:52:24] amen i fed it too
[1:52:32] message one that brother brandon says
[1:52:34] the church
[1:52:35] has long lost its respect
[1:52:40] now because thy god has filled the
[1:52:43] church
[1:52:44] but the church has failed god
[1:52:48] and how how has we felt god is all in
[1:52:52] these pretending stuff
[1:52:57] pretending stuff
[1:52:58] yes sir
[1:53:00] that's what we have failed god
[1:53:03] we can even be a witness
[1:53:06] we don't have a testimony
[1:53:10] praise the lord
[1:53:13] because
[1:53:17] the church
[1:53:19] has long
[1:53:20] lost his respect that's what people can
[1:53:23] say all sorts of things about church
[1:53:25] when the lookout church is just a big
[1:53:27] money making scheme
[1:53:32] that's all the thing about it that's the
[1:53:34] best best
[1:53:36] movie in business now
[1:53:40] you can be tax-free
[1:53:44] and that's all people think about church
[1:53:51] it's a place where we go and show the
[1:53:53] latest faction
[1:53:56] the new thing that is on amazon
[1:54:04] the church has long lost its respect
[1:54:08] now because
[1:54:10] god has filled the church but the church
[1:54:11] has failed god
[1:54:13] it wasn't because thy god have felt
[1:54:16] something but something
[1:54:18] filled god
[1:54:21] praise the lord
[1:54:23] amen
[1:54:24] and we know we know something problem
[1:54:27] we know him he had a loss problem
[1:54:32] amen
[1:54:33] he could cry to god to deliver him from
[1:54:36] the lion
[1:54:37] but he was not sincere to say god i have
[1:54:40] a lost problem
[1:54:44] deliver me
[1:54:46] if god could deliver something from a
[1:54:48] lion if god could give something a
[1:54:51] strain to pick up a city gate
[1:54:56] god don't have that power
[1:54:59] to take the spirit of lust
[1:55:02] from him
[1:55:06] praise the lord
[1:55:16] that was his problem we know that
[1:55:19] where we ought to be standing in such a
[1:55:21] condition like the church
[1:55:24] of us chapter five
[1:55:26] of ananias so far was brought before the
[1:55:28] church
[1:55:30] but instead of that
[1:55:32] we
[1:55:33] have long compromised with the things of
[1:55:36] the world
[1:55:38] we keep putting it off
[1:55:41] when i get married everything will be
[1:55:43] okay
[1:55:45] praise the lord as soon as i start
[1:55:47] working
[1:55:48] everything will be okay
[1:55:50] praise the lord if i move from this city
[1:55:52] and move over to connecticut everything
[1:55:54] will be okay
[1:55:56] praise the lord maybe i think if i go to
[1:55:58] canada it will be okay
[1:56:04] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:56:05] forever
[1:56:07] praise the lord
[1:56:09] amen
[1:56:10] and there's nowhere that god can meet
[1:56:12] you
[1:56:16] and that's how the church compromise we
[1:56:18] we just make a condition
[1:56:21] we just make a condition so we can pass
[1:56:24] ourselves in the things that we're
[1:56:26] doing praise the lord
[1:56:30] amen
[1:56:31] and the thing about it we have people to
[1:56:33] cover up for us
[1:56:39] why am i preaching like this
[1:56:45] glory be to god
[1:56:49] amen
[1:56:55] but the word of god
[1:56:57] is powerful
[1:57:00] this word
[1:57:03] oh glory be to god
[1:57:06] amen
[1:57:08] oh my god amen
[1:57:13] oh jesus
[1:57:15] help us lord yes
[1:57:17] amen
[1:57:21] he's more willing to help us
[1:57:25] then we want to be helped
[1:57:28] he's more willing to help us
[1:57:31] than we want to be helped
[1:57:33] convincing concern he says excuse me
[1:57:35] standing here in a platform speaking
[1:57:38] base
[1:57:39] and rejoicing because i'm so happy to be
[1:57:42] here
[1:57:43] i think that that god wants his children
[1:57:46] to be happy
[1:57:47] i believe
[1:57:49] we
[1:57:50] we can run it to a stream
[1:57:54] praise the lord
[1:57:55] and just
[1:57:57] get insincere
[1:57:59] about it
[1:58:02] we can run it to a stream
[1:58:04] god wants his people to be happy
[1:58:07] amen
[1:58:08] glory be to god i mean we can run into
[1:58:10] the stream we we can become so emotional
[1:58:13] oh let the church say hallelujah
[1:58:16] hallelujah
[1:58:17] all right praise the lord
[1:58:18] and praise the lord

[1:59:02] can bring us together
[1:59:04] young people
[1:59:05] family husband and wife
[1:59:09] with their heart
[1:59:14] of bearing with one another a heart

[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:21] you see many
[2:06:23] homes and some homes
[2:06:26] [Music]
[2:06:29] i don't see this to be in reverend
[2:06:34] but we have the huffman patriot on the
[2:06:36] wall we have the pillow of fire pictured
[2:06:39] on the wall
[2:06:40] but yes we don't have that pillow of
[2:06:42] fire in our heart
[2:06:46] i just read a quote the other day where
[2:06:48] brother branham was talking about that
[2:06:50] very same picture
[2:06:52] he says what i want
[2:06:54] is that that pillow of fire would be in
[2:06:56] your heart
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:05] we will be sincere
[2:07:07] if god will just help us
[2:07:11] to be sincere with ourself
[2:07:15] some of the things that we are allowing
[2:07:17] in our life we know it's not helping us
[2:07:19] it's not helping us it's not carrying
[2:07:22] you any word it's not making anything
[2:07:24] better for you why are you still doing
[2:07:26] it
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:34] and it's so easy for us to find someone
[2:07:37] a way to blame
[2:07:43] when we ourselves we are not taking the
[2:07:45] things of god serious in our life
[2:07:55] no time for personal devotion no time to
[2:07:58] even read god's word
[2:08:03] when right from sunday school that is
[2:08:05] the first verse the sunday school
[2:08:06] teacher teach us men shall not live by
[2:08:09] bread alone but by every word
[2:08:13] that proceeds from the mouth of god
[2:08:19] [Music]
[2:08:27] young people
[2:08:28] the age is so challenging for us
[2:08:31] this information age with technology
[2:08:35] has just exposed us to things
[2:08:38] that our parents and grandparents did
[2:08:40] not even fight

[2:09:14] it does not benefit me to see you every
[2:09:17] sunday

[2:09:22] believe in god holy faith in my heart
[2:09:25] that almighty god is helping you
[2:09:28] and you're walking out of those doors
[2:09:30] struggling and i don't know you are
[2:09:32] struggling

[2:10:12] let's play there
[2:10:15] let's go to the lord in prayer now
[2:10:17] let's just take this time
[2:10:19] the lord gave us a wonderful easter
[2:10:21] meeting
[2:10:22] see how the holy spirit used brother ben
[2:10:26] there was now one stone that he never
[2:10:27] turned over
[2:10:29] he preached all over the place
[2:10:32] the next sunday we came back the holy
[2:10:34] spirit pulled out again and gave us a
[2:10:36] wonderful we can have wonderful
[2:10:38] preaching wonderful messages you want to
[2:10:41] talk about mystery i can preach it from
[2:10:43] off the back of the book
[2:10:49] but it's not a show it's not a it's not
[2:10:51] for showmanship
[2:10:56] if we can preach all of those things and
[2:10:58] don't bring you in contact with jesus
[2:11:00] christ
[2:11:01] and you're not having a personal
[2:11:03] relationship where you know that god is
[2:11:05] speaking to you and god is dealing with
[2:11:07] you and god is helping you
[2:11:11] [Music]
[2:11:36] i believe if their situation in our
[2:11:38] homes we must be able to sit down and
[2:11:41] talk about it we must be able to pray
[2:11:43] and take it before god and cry and say
[2:11:45] god
[2:11:49] you are god
[2:11:50] you can help us
[2:11:52] you can deliver us
[2:11:55] we must ask for all the help that we
[2:11:56] need
[2:11:59] but sometimes we become so proud
[2:12:01] we don't want our name to be to be
[2:12:03] scandal
[2:12:04] we don't want for people to think days
[2:12:06] or say this i don't care what you said
