lord matthew chapter 13 matthew chapter 13. i will come back to matthew chapter 12. uh there's something i want to show show us there's something i want for us to see in the scripture for matthew chapter 13 let's drop down to uh verse 36. let's get down to verse 36. matthew chapter 13 verse 36 then jesus sent his disciple away and went into the house i mean he sent the multitude away praise the lord and his disciple came unto him saying declare unto us the parables of the terrorists of the field amen he answered and said unto them he their soul the good sea is the son of man the field is the word that we are living in the good sea are the sons of the kingdom but the thirds are the sons of the wicked one we will get back to the beginning of the parable but i wanted to read this the thirds are the sons of the wicked one the enemy who saw them is the devil the harvest is the end of the end of the world and the reapers are the angels i'm kind of using the bible yet i have a little slight translation so i don't want to throw you off so i try to follow it up there let's just buy our heads and pray together tonight heavenly father lord jesus we want to thank you lord and and we can all say tonight we are grateful to be back in the house of the lord thank you father lord for your presence that was gracious unto us on sunday lord god and here we are again father lord and uh your word has just been read father we want to ask so god that you will come and help us tonight lord that something will be said of internal value something that will draw us closer to you that's the purpose of your word it's the only thing lord god that has the monetary power in it to draw us to you father we just commit ourself in your hands thank you for the little time of prayer oh god that we have to just leave our spirit up to you mention names and need before you tonight father lord garden we just ask bless the rest of the service now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen genesis chapter 3 you may have your seed we're going to work with the bible a little bit genesis chapter 3 praise the lord other people in the house tonight praise the lord amen [Music] even when i was when we were at jordan's brother jordan's house we heard more noise so praise the lord genesis chapter 3. it's a familiar verse we want to pick up there but i want to see if you're watching tonight amen are we together genesis chapter 3 verse 15 or verse 14 let's read from verse 14 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this there are cursed above all cutters and above every beast of the field upon that ballot there uh shall that go and dost shall there eat all the days of the life wash them and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and horsey and it shall bruise the head and thou shall bruise his head now what i want to pick up here is that the second have a seed amen that's what the scripture is saying he is speaking from from verse 14 and the lord god said unto the second and now in verse 15 he's saying i will put enmity between thee the serpent and the woman and between thee thy seed the serpent see and the woman c praise the lord amen isaiah chapter 14 isaiah chapter 14 praise the lord don't ask me where i'm going tonight i don't know myself i'm just trying to be a follower isaiah chapter 14 let's read verse 29 verse 28 in the year of king ahaz in the year that kinney has died was this burden rejoice not thou all palestina because the road of him that smut thee is broken for out of the serpent's root out of the serpent's root sunday we were speaking about the root and the offspring of david we were talking about god's family tree that started with a seed i was thinking about this today they were sounding funny and as i was thinking about it the seed and the root which one is the first which one is the first is the seed yeah i think i was right when i thought about it that way okay so i i want to get your attention this out of for out of the serpent's root shall come forth uh a crocodile and his fruit shall be a fairy flying serpent now the word that caught my attention there is the serpent's root genesis speaks about the serpent seed and yet now that seed is is is is you know a seed has to die and start to uh germinate to be able to put forth roots so we see here that we having the second rule the second seed the second route so it's going to be a little bit interesting amen praise the lord because just like we did on sunday uh we there's we want to do likewise here uh uh this wednesday night to be able to show from the scripture that there's a reason why god placed two trees in the garden of eden praise the lord those two trees were representation are we together they were representation let's go back to genesis chapter two and uh i'm sure sure i have it here in my notes i didn't make mention about it genesis chapter 2 verse 9. genesis chapter 2 verse 9. now you have to be careful this is not this is not just trying to bring you information i'm not trying to bring you information because i know you know you know a lot of these things but what i'm trying to bring to you and i want for you to see is that we are in harvest time and every seed that was planted in the beginning is coming to its fullness that's what i want you to see wait this is harvest time every seed that was planted is coming to its harvest that's what jesus said in matthew chapter 13 we will get back to death in genesis chapter two verse 9 the bible said verse 8 and the lord god planted a god in east wall in eden and there he pulled the man whom he had formed and out of and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant in the sight and good for food now you will see that uh uh good for food there is uh a semi-colon there trying to separate it's in one sense is separating the trees that are good for food in the sense that all of those trees were natural trees that were good for food the tree of life also was in the midst of the gathering and the tree of knowledge good and evil so out of the ground the lord allowed every tree to grow that was good for food this one were the ones that were good for food but when it comes to the tree of life and the tree of knowledge good and evil they were there for [Music] representation praise the lord that's the reason why in the book of revelation retreat of life appeared again and now it's a book of life in revelation chapter 10 verse 8 you were given the book to eat the book praise the lord amen so i hope you see that you know every tree that was pleasant in to the side and good for food but then there were also two trees that were there and you can look through the structure and you see these two trees running parallel in different form we will talk more about that on sunday if the lord continued to lead us in that direction amen now uh as we look at this look at those those two trees that are there for for representation we will go now to uh matthew chapter matthew chapter 12. let's go to matthew chapter 12 before we start in matthew chapter 13. now you have to know that this is wednesday night amen so just just bear with me [Music] uh matthew chapter 12 praise the lord now you have to realize here we will not be able to read everything over in matthew chapter 12. but there is there is something that happens in matthew chapter 12 that is very very important very very very important that i want to to kind of uh grab your attention in matthew chapter 12 if you look here with me verse 22 then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him in so much that the blind and the dumb both speak and saw and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of david but when the pharisees heard it when the religious people heard it they said this fellow does not cast a devil but by bestiable the prince of the devils and jesus knew they had thought and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought into desolation but this is what a way i want to grab you i mean grab our attention tonight is that this was this what happened right here changes jesus ministry from that time on because yeri said isaiah has prophesied the prophets of all uh the spirit of the law will be the palm main and you hear the brokenhearted and the lame the of the walk and all of those things and yes jesus right into his ministry and what he's done right before the people the bible says the brought a blind man and someone that cannot even speak and jesus pray for them and they are healed right there the the people are witness there's a group that say that looks at that and says and and they can be able to identify what has happened they can identify it with scripture amen there's a group that can be identif that can look at that and identify it with scripture and say is this not the son of david but on this other side the the religious leader of the dead they said no he i mean this man does not do no miracle except it is it is by the devil praise the lord now you will realize yet jesus talks a little bit you know has divided again himself he talks talks now you now watch what happened here let me go back to this the bible says and jesus knew they had thought amen so which means these religious leaders because of what they were taught in their council or what their churches have taught them they are standing there these people are uh are confessing oh man wow what a gift is this what a ministry is this and and here jesus is discerning the attacks praise the lord that's that's just how powerful your thoughts are brother branham said they speak loud lather in the presence of god and even your words jesus discerning their thoughts and saying that uh then he starts or says the arab kingdom divided against himself he said if satan cast a satan he went down he went down he went down now look at verse 38 the bible says then setting of the stripes and the pharisees answer saying master we will see a sign do you see that hypocrisy these very same people that were thinking in your mind that this guy is prince of the devil they are coming before him now trying to behave nice amen but you will see what happened what happened that i want to bring your attention to it is it is from this time jesus he uh he indicted that generation just like when brother brandon preached the message in death me from this time on jesus never spoke in public whenever he speaks in public he speaks in parables from this very time on so in another sense they have rejected the word they have rejected the word no matter how you cry over them no matter how you preach the word they have they have sealed their soul from receiving from god by the action of just sitting down they never say anything they were sitting down and thinking in their mind what is he doing down there just prince of the devil he just plain on the people's mind by that action they sealed themselves out of the kingdom of god and they are coming now to behave as safe to say they are nice as hell to say they are believing and they say master show us show us a sign jesus said no sign will be given to you a wicked and adulterous generation now you have to underline that because we'll be talking we we're talking about the serpent sea his roots and how it has spread out the tree that has grown and the fruit that is bad if a seed is planted and it starts taking root it has to bring up a tree and that tree has to bear fruit so we're going to go into a little bit tonight and he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seek for the sign and there will be no sign given unto them by the sign of the prophet jonah praise the lord now brings us to chapter 13. so chapter 13 show us the change in the ministry there was a junction of time when we get to chapter 13 jesus now he starts talking in parables you have to remember chapter 5 chapter 6 jesus spoke unto them you are the light of the world you were not talking in parables he said if a man looked at a woman and lost after he were not talking in parables he was preaching his message plainly so you see there's one thing i want to bring out i want to bring to you tonight when the word of god is rejected praise the lord and you see right there in chapter 12 that's what jesus talked about blasphemy the son of god a sin that cannot be forgiven so you can see where jesus was in his ministry it was a junction of time where those people they would sit there they would not believe they have sealed themselves out of the kingdom of god by their attitude their attitude not to jesus to the world that was manifested before them because the healing of the sick opening the blind eyes it was the word of god that was promised for that day the world was made flesh before them and they took a wrong attitude the very same thing that king did and god said if you can go back and do like your brother abel well he walked away from the presence of the lord he rejected the correction of the word now we're talking about the seed of the wicked one that is one attribute that is wave the weaker one are we together praise the lord are we together tonight amen you grab the direction we are going in am i making you afraid praise the lord amen i hope we are identified into god's family tree on sunday if you identify into god's family tree you don't have to worry amen praise the lord there are some few uh are we together now if we get over to to uh uh chapter 13 verse 10. jesus has finished talking about a parable some see fought on high ground some see fought in the tongues he finished saying all of that and the disciple came and said unto him why speak adele while speaketh they are unto them in parables they saw something changed in his ministry they noticed that something changed in his ministry praise the lord they notice it that something has changed in his ministry and he said unto them because it is giving unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom but to them it is not giving praise the lord now even though that was not giving unto them it was not that moment that it was given to the disciples and not giving unto them it was something from the foundation of the world but you see the direct rejection to the word that was what brother branham explained in the the lamb and the dove story when brother branham says speaks about the the the scenario that the dove will take is flight it's not that the holy ghost leave and come back on you but if you are mad if you are not submitting to the word the holy ghost cannot work through you because the holy ghost can only work through the channel of the word are we together so the dove would take his flight in the sense that he would just be standing by there because he's i mean he's powerless until he has a body to work through until our will is submitted to him he's not going to struggle over you and your will praise the lord that's the reason why the scripture says stubbornness is as witchcraft amen because what is happening there is that this person is expecting he and god to struggle over him he knows that the word that that the word condemned this thing he's being stubborn thinking that god will smack him and say stop doing it praise the lord are we together so there's a change in the ministry he says it is not giving unto them he says for for whosoever have to him it is giving and he shall have more abundantly into and but whosoever have met from him the little that he has we will even be taken from him it all comes to the rejection of the world the blasphemy of the holy ghost a person can be in that state all that will happen to you is that you will just be walking in intellect and there is nothing here giving you power to live what you are thinking you can argue the word you can argue the word called the code say the dead of the code called the city the message was preached in but you don't have the power here to live the word that's the reason why when god is dealing with our hearts we must speak here to it are we together so there's a change in the ministry the disciples saw it because now he pulled them down aside now everything that he said and see if sora went out to sow seeds and and all of that all of those things that he said he's now coming to explain it to the disciples now this is the very thing that the holy ghost does we can sit in the congregation the preacher can preach the word and move all over to the place and all over the place shouting we can we can sing we can rejoice in the in the preaching of the word but if you are not yelling to the holy ghost he will not follow you whom to teach you you will walk through those doors and when you go outside there you can even remember the message that was preached by the person that is yelling to the holy ghost the holy ghost go with you that word is on your mind when you go home you are meditating on the word he takes you back to the world this is what the preacher was talking about he's trying to make the world more clearer to you because there were things that he was saying that he could not say in the public are we together there are different forms of growth in the church there's a form of growth where we become many and it's a troubling form of growth too troubling form of growth because the scripture says the mixed multitude came at the time they were becoming many when three thousand were added to the church but there was there is another form of growth where the bible says they grew in the word of god praise the lord and it's that form of growth that i'm most interested in amen that we will grow in the word of god now so we see the change of the ministry year and jesus went on and on verse 18 let's take verse 18. year year therefore the parable of the sower what he was really saying now he has brought the disciples into the inner cycle listen to me carefully now listen to me this is what i was really preaching praise the lord amen you see that that is the reason why i believe you know even at the time brother branham was here this message was for the bride over and over brother branham will talk about uh uh maybe i'm just laying a platform for another one to come and many men has raising and they have claimed it if messengers and different ministries joshua and different things but the one that brother branham was talking about was the holy ghost it would be the holy ghost that would take this message and would be able to break the message down to the brine amen will be able to help the bride to feed on the world praise the lord so even at the time he was preaching all of those messages it was to the multitude because many of the people were there only for the manifestation of the gifts that's the reason why when that tear pool came and the world was open they said no there's something wrong with his teaching something wrong with his his daughtering brother brandon has to come back and he says i indebt this generation for crucifying jesus christ the second time you have rejected the word and like paul said it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the living god are we together now so jesus now take his disciples into the inner cycle and he says when any one of you hear the word of god and and understand it not then cometh the weaker one now watch this now watch this because there was a seed of the serpent in the beginning are we together there was a seed of the serpent in the beginning and uh brother branham was going to preach a message he just mentioned it before he passed away that's the only quote i have to read to you tonight part of transformation let's just read that and then we can go ahead he says here he says when i go home this time i'm preaching on this subject the trail of the serpent the beasts are the beginning and the beasts at the end and trail him right through the bible and show how he heads up amen praise the lord now you might agree and say well brother brethren did not preach preach that semen he said what you are going to preach the holy ghost is here praise the lord i'm not preaching what he's going to preach but i'm going to i'm saying that the holy ghost gave him an insight that we can trace the serpent by his trail we can trace the second by his trail because he have a seed and we know all his attributes is in his seed and because of that we can trust him and yeah in isaiah we find he got a root glory be to god amen are we together so jesus you will find this in matthew chapter 13 maybe get home read it again you'll find he's he he keeps speaking this he keep using this word he says when one hears the word of the kingdom and understanding that then cometh the wicked one and he cashes away that which was saw in his heart this is he that received the seed by the wayside are we together i'm trying to get uh now let's let's drop down a little bit verse 24 another parable uh put heat forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is lacking unto a man that saw good seed in the field he's so goosey in the field but why man slept his enemy came and saw tears among the wheat and went away keep that principle also because we'll come back to that are we together verse 36 let's read from verse 34. all these things jesus speak unto unto the multitudes in parable and without parable speak he net unto them from that time whenever he speaks to the multitude he speaks to them in parable and without parable because it is it is at a place where the world was just water on the dock's back it was just putting a a piece before swamps so he speaks in parables now it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables and i will alter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the word so secret from the foundation of the word this is all tied into the mysteries that was in the back part of god's mind are we together then jesus sent a multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declared unto us the parables of the tires of the field and he answered and said unto them he that saw the good seed is the son of man he that saw the good sea is the son of man praise the lord the good seed will be tied to the tree of life we will go we will get into death the field is the word the entire world this entire world now you have to know that jesus here is saying that these things were mysteries from the foundation of the word just like how we talk about god watching over you four generation before you got here those things were in the mind of god you didn't know about it your grandfather didn't know about it amen they were all in god's mind praise the lord the good seed are the children of the kingdom the good seed are the children of the kingdom the good seed is planted by the son of man the son of man plant the children of the kingdom praise the lord that is the reason why in every age god sent a messenger and there are a predestinated people to receive his message praise the lord amen the son of man plant the good sea the good seas are the children of the kingdom are we together tonight but the thirds are the children of the weaker one again he's using the wicked one amen the thirds are the children of the wicked one now you see this this will make the subject of sepancy more clearer to you praise the lord because when we talk about the seventh seed and and we talk on the subject of the separate we run straight to the book of first john you are jumping over an entire dispensation that's why brother branham says here the serpent at the beginning can be traced to the end now if you can trace him find his root in isaiah and see him here as a third over in matthew chapter 13 praise the lord are we together the third are the children of the wicked one the enemy that saw them is the devil so the devil year he's now connected to the third that is the children of the wicked one as the son of man is connected to the good sea that are the children of the kingdom the two trees that was in eden is now appearing before us here in eden we would think that they were literal trees but here jesus now is identifying those trees as persons praise the lord now if you go to the book of isaiah if you go to the book of isaiah and study isaiah chapter 13 and 14 how are they falling o lucifer before isaiah got to death isaiah was talking about babylon so that seed that started in eden its roots reigned through babylon started with mira or we can get into the history tonight i'm just trying to to lay some things down amen you will see just like there were two trees in eden there were two cherubims over the ark of the covenant there were two nations that were that are generally used over and over in the scripture babylon and the new jerusalem are we together tonight praise the lord amen okay it's wednesday night we just have a few minutes but let's just fellowship together tonight amen praise the lord the enemy that saw them is the devil the harvest is the end of the word the angel the the the reapers are the angels which are the messengers that's what brother branham said he says those angels were the messengers in uh in harvest time when he preached the message harvest time that's what he said so we we see here that jesus giving this to us uh want to be able to take up uh a little bit here before we get we get uh first john chapter one no first john chapter two first john chapter two we will follow this wicked one a little bit because you have to realize now we we are talking about the other tree amen and now the other tree is now taking on an identification year of producing fruit that are the weaker one are we together speaking of fruits that are identified with the wicked one first john chapter 2 first john chapter 2. let's read from verse 12 first john chapter 2 verse 12. this is our our our youth youth meetings uh one of our youth meeting verse verses i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiving because your sins are forgiving you for his name's sake i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because yay have overcome the weaker one yeah the weaker one appear again now so you will realize here this is not just this is not just a thought as the seed runs from the beginning as the sea runs from the beginning is is is becoming personalized praise the lord and yeah john is now identifying his is because right here that's where john talks about the manifestation of the sons of god he said for this reason the son of god was manifested to destroy the works of the devil so right here now we realize that it will as we read on you we see pretty soon that it just is more than just a concept amen is more than just a concept it's a spirit it's a spirit that the lies this church is going to fight against it's a spirit that the inlet is going to fight against and i mean when we say we are overcomers in laodicea is because we have overcome the wicked one now by joining church amen not by joining church because when john talks about a year he says young man because you have overcome the wicked one i write unto you my little children because you have known the father and i have read him unto you father because he have known him that is from the beginning i read it unto you again young men because you are strong and the word of god abireth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one oh my goodness now i feel like preaching amen glory be to god the word of god about it in you is the word that overcomes the wicked one see the importance of revelation 10 verse 8 eat the word i'm not talking to you praise the lord seriously i'm talking to her amen i'm waiting for the day where she would say amen then i know that the word has entered you praise the lord amen so you see it you see how we have how we are tracing the second this way we are following the trace of the serpent because you see when you talk about the the the subject on the seventh seed people just think it's brother brandon brother branham doctrine it's it's the word of god and the reason why that mystery was important we would have never overcome if we did not know the two different seed and to be able to identify which scene you are that's the thing that makes you to overcome the teaching of discrepancy is not just to make a uh you know a mysterious acceptance it's not all about what took place in the garden of eden the garden of eden is just a new part of it but to be able to trace that serpent down to our time in our day my goodness when we get in this thing you will realize that we need to be on our toes we need to be in business with god there's no time to play church because i will tell you i will confess one thing to you now this your flesh is a birth of the wicked one oh yeah we got to bring it home because we are getting ready to get out of here praise the lord that's the reason why jeremiah crusade the heart is desperately wicked the heart is desperately weakened by our first birth wickedness comes very close and where is the predestination of god in your soul where is your soul in your heart it comes very close to it and sometimes people think they have too hot my other heart says i should do i say no the other hearts say i shouldn't do it praise the lord you're only having one heart but there is weakness on one side and the seed of god on the other side praise the lord and that's what the holy ghost comes to do to burn that serpent that is down there that's what the baptising of the holy ghost does it burned our serpent are we together to be able to enjoy the fullness of our salvation the joy of our salvation to be able to enjoy our redemption we got to put that serpent on fire praise the lord when that serpent is burned it's hard for your tongue to tell lies you don't have desires and gossips amen you wouldn't love to build people up not to tear them down young man you have overcome the word amen praise the lord amen i love the way he said he already unto you fathers because they have knew him from the beginning i've read it unto you young men young people because you are strong and the word of god abide in you just last week we were talking about the abiding presence that comes with his word and his name take the name of jesus with you wherever where you go because it's the word but branham said why we we have read that to you over and over it's not the it's not the person that comes predestinated it is not you that comes predestinated is the word of god that is predestinated for this age to have sons and daughters it's the word that comes predestinated and that word quickens the word in you you see your name in the book and you say amen to the word of god are we together praise the lord having a few minutes here now let's just wrap up on this on this on this wicked one a little bit here the chapter three let's look at chapter three verse 11 for this is the message for this is the message i preached this one time somewhere i can remember where was that this is the message you see the message we are in the message this is the message this is the message to overcome the weaker one is the message to be in fellowship with god is the message to walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us that is the message for this is the message that we have heard from the beginning the message from the beginning this is the same john that said in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god he's always sending us back to the beginning because genesis is the c chapter amen is the c chapter this is the message that we have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as king who is of that wicked one praise the lord now you see if you if you just if you just take this scripture or take this verse and tie it to to genesis chapter 3 without finding the succession of voices that progress to these words you are making king the sea of the serpent praise the lord and you are just living it like that you you cannot be able to trace it john the baptist came he rebuked his generation he says you are bruised serpents he called them serpents not because he never had vocabulary to to uh to preach to them he called them serpent because that was what was happening the root of the serpent has has spread out into religion the root of the serpent was uh has spread out into judaism that the people were following traditions they were following traditions instead of identifying the word of god when jesus came he did the same thing he called them serpent you are of your father the devil are we together the only thing genesis chapter 3 brings out for us it helped us to find the missing link and how do we find the missing link because the second was upright he was not a raptor so genesis 3 show us the missing link and the next thing that genesis 3 revealed to us is the mix of blood that manga the serpent seed into the sons of god so it's hard now for you to find it that's what brandon says our flesh is was breeded between the serpent and eve because of the fall that's why we had to be born by natural birth so you can't just look at a man by his hair cut and say you are serpenty oh because a man is wearing necktie and glory to god he said yeah he's a seed of god we have seen many seed of god that have turned their back on the message praise the lord and even if they fall from the mess you still can't call them serpentine why because there is still blood on the throne so don't be looking for serpent sea all over the place be looking to bring the serpent from here be looking to kick the serpent out of this body praise the lord glory be to god now that's king who was of that wicked one and he slayed his brother and whosoever's and and and whosoever slayed him because his own works with evil and his brother works was righteous praise the lord he says marvin that brethren if the world hits you we know that we have passed from death onto life you know so yeah he's he's he's dealing he's dealing also with with with hatred or hatred why should you hate a person why why should you hit a person praise the lord having the ability to be able to separate a person from the wrong you can hit the wrong but with the love of god in your heart you will you always love that person you will love and wish that they can be safe are we together praise the lord i was listening to to uh to a scallop and uh one famous bible teacher and he was there on genesis and talking about how those angels genesis chapter 6 the sons of god saw the daughter of man and his i mean in his fighting in his mind trying to prove that the sons of god were injurious amen and he's he's uh he's he's proving it with all all the the mysterious thing he's trying to bring in my mind i'm saying these scholars they will struggle to believe that the serpent amen that the devil became the serpent in genesis 3. they would struggle with that but they came mystified and tried to make it mysterious how falling angels came down now watch the deception here when they talk about these falling angels that came down and saw the daughters of men what do they say that says they went after the daughters of men and they have children and those children were giants but they would not see that the serpent also had children with eve when you bring there they argue about it no no no no no the bible didn't say that the bible never even said angels and even if we want to take the place of angels jesus said we will be like angels erasing the sex glance angels don't have sex claims just that scripture in the new testament erased the fact that it was angers that came down because angels do not have sex claims but bring them to to serpenty you can show them you can lay the word out to them they can see it why because it was not given to them to see that is the reason why you don't struggle to make somebody to see it was not given to them to see it you love the lord tonight oh we are blessed people we should be having happy faces even beyond the max we should know how to smile even behind the max praise the lord even behind the max no mask you hold our smile back praise the lord glory be to god because we have what it takes to be happy there are some things that we have gone into night and deal with that that seen nature deal with weakness that's some of the highest form of weakness for a person to come to the house of god and don't receive from god come to the house of god and don't receive from god come to the house of god and i mean and don't receive the word come to the house of god and sleep that wickiness it might sound funny but that's wickedness is the wicked one that is getting at you and like i've always said the most spiritual person is the one that stands up you go back there and you fight that devil he's not the one that is trying to be smart oh yeah amen glory be to god first john chapter five let's just take one more and then we close for the night i know i've given you a lot of things to think about tonight i've given you a lot of things to go home and read and study those of you that have taken notes to study this is a serious business praise the lord but we will get we'll get into it we get more into it as we as we go along i don't know if we will continue on sunday or maybe on uh on another time you know when i get into this series it's hard to get out of here man i'm having a lot of on end their series i got to get back to the book of acts amen oh praise the lord now now first john chapter 5 verse 18 let's let's read this one together tonight just try to bring a little bible studies here for us to be able to get this thing into some uh good perspective and see the things that we are dealing with see the things we are dealing with that will bring out uh some things for us to talk about you know verse 18 first john chapter 5 verse 18 we know that whosoever is born of god seen it not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and the wicked one touched him net praise the lord and we know that we are of god and the whole word the whole word the cosmos of this world liareth in wickedness another thing another scripture that proves to us that satan is the god of this evil age the whole world liarette in weakness all of these things running campaigning uh uh we don't have no scriptural uh uh uh a candidate i don't care what you think the reason is because god always ordained like the bible said a government is ordained of god to whip the people back when the church has filled the people praise the lord because if the church were keeping the people in the word of god amen if they were keeping the standard of the word of god not turning the word of god into a nightclub or with all of these disco lighting and all of the things that they are preaching keeping the people back to bible standards we will not have the bunch of divorce problems that we have keeping the people back to bible standards we will not have a bunch of young people all in the streets because the church has failed so god will always raise up a leader praise the lord that's why the government that's that's the thing that makes the government a dean of god god is he does not have no political party god does not have political party you want to make one party a god party in the other party devil party that's not the message i'm preaching here tonight the whole world lyreth in wickedness oh i can go on tonight i'm i'm just just that now say i feel like preaching here man i've exhausted my time already amen musicians you can come for tonight amen you can come for tonight the whole world larith in wickedness saints of god brothers and sisters but we have a kingdom we have a kingdom coming that's the reason why we have to mean business with god we have young people that need to be born again and need a true experience of the holy ghost we cannot give them any substitute because god is still god praise the lord we have young people going into marriage and and and trying to raise a family in this whole world alert in wickedness we don't have a cornerstone with god we would think that all of the things that have been preached to all out of the years were just lies because that's what people say they come to that place we believe this thing and it is not real it is the problem is not the word the problem is our attitude to the word because the word of god is alive the word of god is real let's buy our house together tonight let's buy our house together tonight we can go home and do the rest of the praying you think about the things we say the whole world larath and weakness and all of the things uh uh spiritual battles you know what the god of this evil age warring against us and all of that we have to take our stand with the world if god has given us grace he has opened our eyes to the world he's dealing with our heart don't take it for granted don't think that oh yeah you know you can come back anytime and get the same experience with god if god is dealing with you give your heart to god submit yourself to god the holy ghost is not a guess you can't guess the holy ghost people say oh i received the whole we need the holy ghost every day of our life we need a refilling that's why brother branham said the dynamics of this church would be the refilling of the holy ghost we need the baptism of the holy ghost every service we come talk we must experience a refreshing from god [Music] we have to know where we're standing [Music] people nero bless the lord to the cross where thou [Music] blessed lord to their preachers bleed
