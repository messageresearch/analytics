[38:08] let's turn to the book of trinity
[38:10] tonight
[38:11] i
[38:12] have a little thought i want to share
[38:14] that will be in in first timothy chapter
[38:17] 2
[38:18] praise the lord
[38:20] amen
[38:22] i was talking with a brother
[38:25] [Music]
[38:27] just a week before i traveled and we
[38:29] were talking about some few things
[38:32] you know and and then he
[38:34] he said is to me
[38:36] you know uh uh that he was he was
[38:38] sharing with with another brother
[38:40] you know that uh
[38:42] uh on the book of on the book of hebrew
[38:45] you know and it says uh you know uh
[38:48] uh know now in the book of hebrew
[38:49] naturally on the book of hebrew he was
[38:51] sharing
[38:52] uh with the brother and he says
[38:54] he says uh paul was a prophet
[38:57] you know and and this and this uh
[38:59] individual i've already backslided from
[39:01] the message so he says well you want to
[39:03] say that because brother branham said it
[39:06] you know and and and the brothers say
[39:08] yeah uh you know uh because i believe
[39:11] brother branham is a prophet
[39:13] you know he said by then you can prove
[39:15] it to me in the scripture
[39:18] you know and uh and the brother says
[39:20] well i believe what the prophet said
[39:24] you know and and as much as i respect
[39:27] his earnest and as much as respect you
[39:30] know him
[39:31] saying that uh uh what the prophet said
[39:35] i also felt like uh
[39:39] it was it was
[39:40] it was almost
[39:42] the same of
[39:44] of if you remember dr
[39:47] is that dr rafi that came to see brother
[39:49] branham
[39:50] when he met that muslim man
[39:52] and the muslim man challenged him and
[39:55] says if your jesus is
[39:57] raising he said the works that you do
[40:00] you will do the same work
[40:02] he said when he fixed that challenge he
[40:04] said brother branham i thought of you
[40:08] praise the lord and i felt the same in
[40:11] my heart i just thought that
[40:13] uh well i wish that i had the
[40:15] opportunity
[40:17] uh
[40:18] i was going to show that brother right
[40:19] in the pages of the bible that paul is a
[40:22] prophet
[40:24] not only that brother branham said it
[40:26] but i've also believed that brother
[40:27] branham said it because the scripture
[40:29] teaches so
[40:31] amen
[40:32] so because of that i've been kind of for
[40:34] taking some time to to see if i will i
[40:37] will find find the way of the law to
[40:39] speak on the first prophet messenger to
[40:42] the gentile age but that's not what i
[40:44] would do tonight
[40:46] that's not what i would do tonight i
[40:47] would just i'll take a little talk here
[40:51] so we can be able to have some time to
[40:54] pray but i really been praying about it
[40:56] and been asking the lord to
[40:58] to to just
[41:00] uh
[41:01] give me the leadership
[41:02] and
[41:03] and
[41:04] for me to be able to share some things
[41:06] why we believe that paul was a prophet
[41:09] from the message and also from the
[41:11] scripture
[41:12] because i believe it's right in the
[41:14] bible
[41:15] amen
[41:16] praise the lord
[41:18] i believe he's writing the bible when we
[41:20] talk among ourselves as message
[41:22] believers and people that appreciate
[41:24] this message you know is we we can we
[41:27] can you know just uh quote the prophet
[41:29] and everything but when a person does
[41:31] not believe the message and you start
[41:32] with the prophet i mean you're just
[41:34] hanging them that's right i mean you
[41:36] you're i mean you you
[41:38] you're creating uh committing a serious
[41:41] crime you you kind of
[41:42] hanging that person you're either
[41:44] drowning them under the water or you're
[41:46] hanging them on the rope it would just
[41:48] be better you just shoot them don't
[41:50] don't kill them like that
[41:54] praise the lord
[41:56] but let's read the scripture tonight
[41:58] that would be first timothy chapter 2.
[42:02] let's read from verse 13.
[42:17] let's read from verse 13
[42:20] and if i would do justice let's read
[42:22] from verse 11.
[42:25] verse 11 let let the women let the woman
[42:28] learn in silence
[42:31] wave all
[42:33] subjections
[42:34] now you have to realize that a
[42:37] suggestion is different from submissions
[42:41] praise the lord
[42:43] they might they might have some sense of
[42:46] similarity but with what paul is talking
[42:49] about here he's talk he's going to talk
[42:51] about authority that's why he's using
[42:54] subjections
[42:57] praise the lord
[42:59] so he says uh
[43:00] uh
[43:02] but a softer not a woman to teach not to
[43:05] assume authority so you see why he used
[43:08] subjection and not submission
[43:12] the lord
[43:14] i suffer
[43:16] not a woman to teach not to assault
[43:18] authority over man
[43:20] but to be in silence for adam
[43:25] was first formed than eve
[43:31] and adam was not deceived
[43:34] praise the lord
[43:36] but the woman being deceived
[43:39] was in the transgression
[43:42] amen

[45:25] amen
[45:27] praise the lord the bible says and adam
[45:30] was not deceived you see this this
[45:33] particular
[45:35] scripture
[45:36] uh many many of us around the message
[45:42] try to use that
[45:44] as some sense
[45:46] to escape the fall
[45:49] and to blame eve and blame the woman for
[45:52] the fall
[45:53] we tried to use that the bible said the
[45:55] man was not deceived
[45:57] it was a woman that was deceived and
[46:00] most of the time when people approach
[46:02] this subject
[46:03] especially
[46:05] us around the message it is just a
[46:08] concept it is just a
[46:10] theological concept geological uh to
[46:14] logic means and knowledge of god so you
[46:16] don't have to go to seminary you know to
[46:19] to have a theological concept it's
[46:21] because we've been taught and and and
[46:24] and in the way that we understand
[46:27] genesis chapter 3 make us to come to
[46:30] that conclusion praise the lord you know
[46:33] uh uh uh the
[46:35] the the woman
[46:37] was deceived the man was not deceived
[46:39] but i want to approach it different
[46:41] tonight
[46:42] and tell
[46:43] and and tell you tonight that uh
[46:46] uh
[46:48] if you if you look at it and you bring
[46:51] it
[46:51] to uh
[46:53] to to the justice you bring it to the
[46:56] justice of god
[46:58] if you deal with this subject and
[47:00] deal with it to the justice of god you
[47:03] will realize that the justice of god
[47:06] report on a person that is deceived
[47:11] and the justice of god we condemn a man
[47:14] that will walk open eyes into sin
[47:18] and that's what adam did
[47:24] if you approach it on god's justice
[47:28] god justice
[47:31] will forgive someone that is deceived
[47:33] because they were deceived they were
[47:34] literal
[47:37] then the person that will walk willingly
[47:40] knowing that this is wrong
[47:43] and that's what adam
[47:45] did yes
[47:53] so if you think because you are a man
[47:56] and you represent adam so it makes you
[47:58] proud that adam was not deceived i would
[48:01] tell you the justice of god will condemn
[48:03] you if you know that something is wrong
[48:07] and you walk with consciousness into it
[48:11] the justice of god condemned you
[48:14] god would be more merciful
[48:16] to a person that was deceived
[48:19] they were deceived because they were
[48:21] little
[48:22] they were tricked into believing
[48:27] that it was true
[48:32] praise the lord
[48:37] did i throw you off tonight
[48:44] i can tell when you are thinking when
[48:46] the building gets quiet
[48:49] then i know your wheels are spinning
[48:56] praise the lord
[49:00] amen
[49:05] glory be to god amen you see when we
[49:07] read the scripture in this way
[49:11] and and and we just we just read it in
[49:14] in a in in a surface
[49:17] you know in a surface approach or in a
[49:20] shadow approach
[49:22] we turn
[49:24] to lost
[49:25] the divine concept
[49:29] that is in the scripture
[49:32] praise the lord
[49:35] amen
[49:41] adam was first formed in eve
[49:45] you see this this is uh this is just a
[49:48] uh uh
[49:50] a place
[49:52] of sequence
[49:56] adam was first formed in eve
[50:00] does that have to do with anything that
[50:02] has to do with
[50:04] one being superior and the other one
[50:06] being inferior
[50:08] praise the lord
[50:09] amen
[50:10] it doesn't have to do with that
[50:23] and adam was not deceived by the woman
[50:25] being deceived was in the transgression
[50:29] praise the lord
[50:31] amen
[50:37] now standing she shall be safe
[50:40] and childbearing
[50:43] if they continue in the faith
[50:46] and charity
[50:48] and holiness
[50:49] with subreddit
[50:51] now now
[50:53] paul says here she shall be saved in
[50:56] childbearing
[50:58] and he says
[51:00] if they continue in the faith
[51:02] praise the lord
[51:05] not if she continues in the fight
[51:08] but if they continue in the faith so
[51:10] right here paul
[51:12] is now actually separating the man from
[51:16] the woman he's keeping both of them
[51:17] together
[51:19] praise the lord
[51:20] he's keeping both of them together
[51:23] glory be to god tonight
[51:32] tonight i will speak on the redemptive
[51:35] rope
[51:37] the redemptive rob as we read you will
[51:39] see exactly that i took this this is
[51:41] this is uh right in the court here
[51:43] brother branham called it the redemptive
[51:45] rock and the way i think about it is the
[51:48] other uh uh the redemptive rob is is the
[51:52] love of god
[51:54] amen
[51:55] is the love of god when a person is able
[51:58] to go an extra mile jesus said if they
[52:01] ask you to go in my go to
[52:03] redemptive rock what makes you to bear
[52:06] with people amen redemptive raw what
[52:09] makes you to cover the multitude of sin
[52:12] and only talks about the good that you
[52:14] know about the person and not not not
[52:17] trying to be smart and destroying people
[52:19] character no redemptive rob will not do
[52:22] that and every time a person try to do
[52:24] that you're only trying to make yourself
[52:26] good
[52:27] every time you try to gossip or tell
[52:30] something about somebody
[52:32] unconsciously you're telling the person
[52:35] that i'm better than that person
[52:39] praise the lord that's what you are
[52:41] doing
[52:42] amen
[52:44] redemptive rob would not do this as we
[52:47] look at the subject we realize that god
[52:50] by grace
[52:52] uh uh uh uh
[52:54] he has put a redemptive rob upon you and
[52:56] myself
[52:58] amen that while we were yes sinners yes
[53:01] sir
[53:02] christ died for our sin
[53:05] amen
[53:06] yes thank you we realized that in edem
[53:09] he brought a redemptive rob to adam
[53:12] and say adam adam where are you and and
[53:15] god was seeking him uh to be able to
[53:18] dress him in that righteousness but he
[53:20] was conscious of his wrong and he was
[53:22] running away from god you know but yet
[53:25] we will see it as we go along let's
[53:27] let's read a little bit here this will
[53:29] be able to set the
[53:31] the you know the the place for us to go
[53:33] tonight by the grace of god
[53:36] amen
[53:38] are we together
[53:41] praise the lord
[53:43] are you with me tonight yes
[53:47] amen
[53:50] now brother brahm took this in the
[53:51] message position of a believer in christ
[53:55] you see adam sinned it
[53:57] and condemned
[53:59] and was driving from the garden of eden
[54:02] by god
[54:04] now he's establishing the thought
[54:07] because he's about to say something so
[54:09] he's establishing the thought that adam
[54:11] committed sin
[54:13] amen what he did was wrong
[54:18] and and and and
[54:20] and and because it was wrong he was
[54:23] condemned
[54:24] it was that condemnation that make him
[54:26] to hide himself from god
[54:29] and and both of them were driven from
[54:30] the garden of eden he said see
[54:33] their redemptive rob over him showed
[54:36] that there was some redemptive roar that
[54:39] was placed on him
[54:41] it shows that he seemed because if he
[54:43] never seen it he don't need redemption
[54:47] he don't need it to be covered
[54:50] are we together praise the lord
[54:54] he says well what i said adam's sin
[54:58] wayfully
[55:01] praise the lord
[55:03] adam's sin
[55:04] wayfully
[55:07] are we together
[55:09] oh praise the lord
[55:15] and uh
[55:26] you see yeah
[55:35] i started on this on the subject some
[55:38] time ago
[55:39] and i was i was really not able to
[55:42] to get back to it but a strange thing
[55:44] when i got out there i was i was
[55:46] actually i was actually preaching on
[55:49] that
[55:50] amen
[55:53] but if the lord
[55:55] uh
[55:57] help us maybe one of these days we will
[56:00] we might be able to to get back to death
[56:03] if god will give us grace
[56:09] now the scripture says here in hebrew
[56:11] chapter 10
[56:14] let's go back let's go to hebrew chapter
[56:17] 10.
[56:19] in hebrews 10 verse 26
[56:22] the bible says
[56:24] for if we sin willfully
[56:28] after that we have received
[56:30] the knowledge of the truth
[56:33] they are remaining
[56:35] no more sacrifice
[56:37] for sin
[56:41] amen
[56:44] and brother brandon is saying adam's sin
[56:47] wayfully
[56:52] are we together
[56:58] let's read a bit let's read a little bit
[56:59] i said adam saying wavefully
[57:02] see eve was this eve was actually
[57:06] deceived but adam was not deceived
[57:10] he
[57:10] deliberately
[57:12] sinned
[57:16] praise the lord
[57:17] now you remember in the book of acts
[57:20] there was a prophet called agabus
[57:24] and and and i got boss when when paul
[57:27] was down there in phillip house
[57:30] and uh uh they were having a meeting and
[57:32] philip young daughters he had four girls
[57:36] and and and and those girls i mean they
[57:38] were they were virtuous young girl
[57:40] filled with the holy ghost and they had
[57:42] the gift of god upon their life
[57:45] you know uh uh
[57:48] and agapos came
[57:50] there and and and he prophesied
[57:54] you know
[57:55] he took paul
[57:57] uh uh uh you know uh rob the thing that
[58:01] goes elijah goes around his rope and say
[58:04] the man that has this you know he had it
[58:06] and he says you know his hands will be
[58:09] bound his hands his feet will be bound
[58:13] and and he prophesied thou said the lord
[58:18] he said change a witty
[58:23] praise the lord
[58:24] and yet with all that prophecy
[58:27] paul was still determined to go back to
[58:30] jerusalem
[58:33] so what can we say paul willfully
[58:37] went into prison
[58:39] he willfully walked into what he
[58:42] suffered
[58:45] because a word has been given the
[58:47] prophecy was given thou said the lord
[58:50] chains and with the man
[58:52] that have this
[58:59] are we together
[59:01] so brother branham is also bringing adam
[59:04] into the same situation
[59:06] that he deliberately
[59:13] eve was deceived oh thank god the church
[59:17] is eve amen i thank god i i i thank god
[59:23] that i'm eve tonight
[59:27] so you want to be proud of being adam
[59:29] you go right ahead
[59:33] because
[59:34] he that sin willfully
[59:36] [Laughter]
[59:38] that's the lord of god
[59:47] adam seemed willfully eve was actually
[59:49] deceived by adam was not deceived he
[59:52] deliberately seen he deliberately
[59:55] ignoring what he was doing
[59:59] because of his wife
[1:00:04] praise the lord
[1:00:06] the reason that people can be able to
[1:00:08] think
[1:00:09] whether i should forgive her or not is
[1:00:12] because there are plenty of women around
[1:00:14] them
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:18] they can start making options in their
[1:00:20] mind
[1:00:25] praise the lord that thought never
[1:00:27] crossed out of mine
[1:00:30] and i never thought in his mind well
[1:00:33] okay now you have done this let me let
[1:00:36] me think about it you give me some time
[1:00:37] let me think about it adam had no time
[1:00:40] to think
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:45] he had no time to think
[1:00:48] he never considered another option in
[1:00:51] his mind
[1:00:56] so say well okay the prophet said well i
[1:00:58] can marry but i have to marry virgin you
[1:01:01] know the prophet say you know i i can
[1:01:03] married if she do this i can put her
[1:01:05] away and get another wife
[1:01:08] and we start looking for all the cod
[1:01:10] codes and looking for all the quotes in
[1:01:12] the message
[1:01:16] because we have options
[1:01:22] praise the lord
[1:01:28] we find code to get ourselves in trouble
[1:01:30] then we find courts to bear ourself out
[1:01:41] but one day we will realize that's not
[1:01:43] the reason why god gave us a message
[1:01:48] the message was far away to do with you
[1:01:51] building yourself out and and you know
[1:01:54] uh finding a license to do this and
[1:01:56] finding the code you can tack on your
[1:01:58] back
[1:02:01] the one you can pull right to your door
[1:02:03] so when people come they can read it
[1:02:04] straight
[1:02:06] and make sure they are colored standing
[1:02:07] and dress butting their shirt and
[1:02:09] everything you just put the entire
[1:02:10] church order right to your door
[1:02:16] that's that was not what the coats were
[1:02:18] giving for
[1:02:20] this message is christ in us the hope of
[1:02:23] glory
[1:02:26] praise the lord
[1:02:27] that's what this message is is christ
[1:02:30] in you
[1:02:32] the hope of glory yes
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:38] he deliberately seen knowing what he was
[1:02:41] doing because
[1:02:43] of his wife
[1:02:46] he took position
[1:02:51] with his wife
[1:02:56] then they went before god
[1:02:58] and both of them
[1:03:00] was condemned
[1:03:02] praise the lord
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:08] sarah came to abraham and said what i
[1:03:10] haven't met here
[1:03:12] and and and you've been talking about a
[1:03:15] son and and and you know abraham we have
[1:03:18] waited we have waited why if you know
[1:03:20] why if uh uh uh you know uh the the
[1:03:24] promise was actually spiritual and you
[1:03:27] were looking at it physical well this
[1:03:29] may she's my daughter so
[1:03:31] she's just like me if she have the child
[1:03:34] it's my child she's in my house i raised
[1:03:37] her i fed her and she gave all of the
[1:03:40] reason all of the reason
[1:03:43] man when people want to do wrong that's
[1:03:45] when they can be revelated
[1:03:48] it can just be flooring
[1:03:53] and they can connect this with they can
[1:03:55] connect it with this other when they're
[1:03:56] connected with this you see what i'm
[1:03:58] saying you see it
[1:03:59] is it cleared and you remember the gate
[1:04:02] i mean they can just connect and connect
[1:04:04] and connect
[1:04:14] and then when uh uh uh
[1:04:20] praise the lord
[1:04:28] so we see here when
[1:04:32] ishmael was born
[1:04:37] genesis chapter 16 let's look there a
[1:04:39] little baby
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:43] are we together
[1:04:45] praise the lord
[1:05:06] when people
[1:05:10] want to do wrong and and sometimes it's
[1:05:12] it's not uh you know sometimes it's not
[1:05:15] a sinful thing it's it's just that when
[1:05:17] a person wants to have their will
[1:05:20] when they want their will to be to be to
[1:05:22] prevail and and and and they want to
[1:05:26] they want to they want to cover it up
[1:05:28] with scriptures and cults and ideas
[1:05:31] they have a way of driving their home
[1:05:34] praise the lord
[1:05:36] solomon says that person is a taber i
[1:05:39] mean he knows how to talk even saying
[1:05:41] you see when this one happened then you
[1:05:43] watch it and when you watch it and come
[1:05:45] down and watch it with this other one
[1:05:47] you know and it bring all those kind of
[1:05:48] a connection
[1:05:50] now we realize here in in genesis
[1:05:53] chapter 16
[1:05:57] the bible says we we dealt with this the
[1:06:00] other time here
[1:06:02] uh
[1:06:04] now sarah abraham why bear him no
[1:06:07] children and and she hadn't made the
[1:06:09] egyptian whose name was higher
[1:06:12] and and sarah said on behold now the
[1:06:15] lord have restrained me from bearing i
[1:06:17] pray thee
[1:06:19] going on to my mid
[1:06:22] now
[1:06:24] and and and and and the bible says and
[1:06:26] abraham hacking to the voice of sarah
[1:06:29] now you you see here that abraham he has
[1:06:33] waited on god he's he will so for him to
[1:06:36] really yank into his wife which means
[1:06:39] she really
[1:06:40] pound him down with argument to convince
[1:06:43] him
[1:06:45] but as the story will go on and you can
[1:06:47] read the rest
[1:06:48] we know that the table turned haggar
[1:06:51] started having an attitude
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:56] and in verse 5 the bible says and sarah
[1:06:59] said unto abram my wrong be on thee
[1:07:04] i have given my maid into that boson and
[1:07:07] when she saw that she had conceived
[1:07:10] i was despised in her eyes the lord
[1:07:13] george between me and thee
[1:07:17] praise the lord
[1:07:19] why does she what is she doing now she
[1:07:22] realized
[1:07:24] uh uh that the after effects she's
[1:07:26] coming back to the law she's coming back
[1:07:28] to the word
[1:07:34] but on the prophecy
[1:07:36] she says
[1:07:38] my wrong be on thee
[1:07:42] are we together
[1:07:47] and then as you read on
[1:07:49] you'll realize that
[1:07:53] when uh uh uh
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:57] abraham
[1:07:59] and then and and and his wife you know
[1:08:02] was she was trying to pull i got a wayne
[1:08:05] and and abraham was trying to appeal to
[1:08:08] her no don't do it you know what she's
[1:08:10] she's scaring the child the lord came
[1:08:12] down to abraham says listen to your wife
[1:08:27] are we together
[1:08:33] now so as we look at this redemptive
[1:08:35] rock
[1:08:37] you you'll realize that
[1:08:39] it's not one that a man made is one that
[1:08:42] god himself made from the foundation of
[1:08:45] the word
[1:08:46] he dress it in his mind he's he faction
[1:08:49] is in his mind for his people and let's
[1:08:52] go ahead here brother branham says here
[1:08:54] he says uh
[1:08:55] he took position with his wife then then
[1:08:59] they went before god and both of them
[1:09:02] was condemned adam chooses to be
[1:09:04] condemned with his wife
[1:09:06] he choose
[1:09:07] mad to make her a lesser person he
[1:09:10] choose not to make her feel guilty but
[1:09:14] to also you know uh partake in in what
[1:09:18] has happened praise the lord
[1:09:22] you realize that that is the same place
[1:09:24] the scripture brings us to when the
[1:09:26] bible says confess your fault one unto
[1:09:29] another
[1:09:33] the reason why that is good is because
[1:09:35] it brings both of you on
[1:09:38] on a level you know a level plane
[1:09:41] you know there is no one righteous
[1:09:43] person in the other person you really
[1:09:45] need god you really need god you did
[1:09:48] that you really need god you need the
[1:09:50] holy ghost
[1:09:53] no
[1:10:00] praise the lord but you see when we
[1:10:02] share our weaknesses with one another
[1:10:06] and we share that our struggle with one
[1:10:09] another
[1:10:11] praise the lord
[1:10:13] you see this it's an era of building
[1:10:16] confidence
[1:10:20] and that's the reason why we can share
[1:10:23] our struggle
[1:10:24] is because we look at this person to be
[1:10:27] more spiritual
[1:10:29] all we think what if i if i tell them
[1:10:32] now you know what uh they will go and
[1:10:34] tell somebody else and then everybody
[1:10:36] will look at me like that so we just
[1:10:38] keep the struggle in and we struggle
[1:10:40] with the struggle
[1:10:46] praise the lord
[1:10:53] by the way to build confidence
[1:11:00] is to be able to share our struggle
[1:11:02] with one another
[1:11:05] your struggle might not be a present
[1:11:07] moment
[1:11:08] it might it might be something that you
[1:11:10] went through
[1:11:13] and you think and and and and you and
[1:11:16] and when you share with the person it
[1:11:18] gave them an open door to realize oh wow
[1:11:22] oh wow god brought them through that
[1:11:26] praise the lord
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:34] i remember one time long time ago a good
[1:11:37] friend of mine
[1:11:40] he was dealing with some things and you
[1:11:42] know we were talking
[1:11:44] and and and he he he asked me you know
[1:11:46] we are very good friends we talk you
[1:11:48] know we share things and then as we're
[1:11:51] walking and fellowshipping i realized
[1:11:53] that he wanted to say some things to me
[1:11:55] in a way that his language was going the
[1:11:57] way he was talking so he said he asked
[1:11:59] me the question he said brother one
[1:12:02] he says
[1:12:03] since you be essentially following the
[1:12:05] lord have you ever failed i said oh yeah
[1:12:08] brother
[1:12:11] yeah i i i i can say i can stay imagine
[1:12:15] in my mind when i said that to him
[1:12:20] the kind of a relief that i brought to
[1:12:22] him
[1:12:23] he said oh wow
[1:12:26] then pretty soon he find
[1:12:28] you know the comfort
[1:12:30] to start sharing what he wanted to share
[1:12:32] with me and we know we were talking and
[1:12:34] all of that
[1:12:36] so
[1:12:37] we we as we went further
[1:12:40] and then he says he says uh
[1:12:43] he says how was your experience i said
[1:12:45] brother
[1:12:46] we fall every day
[1:12:53] he said oh wow i never thought about it
[1:12:55] like that
[1:13:00] he said oh wow i never thought about it
[1:13:02] like that you know
[1:13:05] and and but we are we we have already
[1:13:07] got ourselves engaged in the
[1:13:09] conversation you know then he trusted me
[1:13:11] and we were we were talking about that
[1:13:13] but you see i'm just talking about the
[1:13:15] complex
[1:13:17] that people have
[1:13:20] and sometimes we build that complex
[1:13:26] praise the lord
[1:13:27] we build that complex
[1:13:30] that's the reason why when you want to
[1:13:32] help a fallen brother the best way to do
[1:13:34] it is to start to testify to him some of
[1:13:37] the things that the lord has done in
[1:13:39] your life
[1:13:40] and some of the places that god has
[1:13:42] brought you from
[1:13:44] then
[1:13:44] in that way you are building confidence
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:52] verb adam says and jesus
[1:13:55] not ignorant of what he was doing oh my
[1:13:58] goodness
[1:13:59] oh my goodness
[1:14:02] you mean
[1:14:04] he also seemed wavefully
[1:14:10] and jesus not ignorant of what he was
[1:14:13] doing he came down
[1:14:15] and and and and took his place with the
[1:14:19] sinner the church
[1:14:21] that he might redeem the church back to
[1:14:24] god
[1:14:26] praise the lord but you see
[1:14:28] he could not do that
[1:14:30] without eating with the publicans
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:36] without being called the friend of
[1:14:39] sinners
[1:14:40] and the reason why he was called the
[1:14:42] friend of sinners is because he was not
[1:14:45] wiping his shoulders among them
[1:14:47] he was embracing them
[1:14:50] he was shaking their hand how are you
[1:14:57] he was not hi
[1:15:00] hi
[1:15:03] no
[1:15:06] he was called a friend of cena's
[1:15:10] yeah
[1:15:12] and you can only be called a friend when
[1:15:14] there is a sense of association
[1:15:19] praise the lord
[1:15:24] he took place with the sin of the church
[1:15:27] that he might redeem the church back to
[1:15:30] himself see i said it was a type
[1:15:34] adam
[1:15:35] was
[1:15:36] christ is the second adam
[1:15:49] where through the the the first adam all
[1:15:52] die
[1:15:54] true second adam all life
[1:15:59] praise the lord
[1:16:00] amen now you will understand the
[1:16:03] conversation brother brandon preached
[1:16:04] something and somebody went with the
[1:16:06] thought and says he said adam never seen
[1:16:08] it
[1:16:09] you know that's that's where this whole
[1:16:11] conversation is from so brother bannon
[1:16:13] is coming back and he re-addressing it
[1:16:15] no i did not say that adam never seen
[1:16:18] what i said was adam singer deliberately
[1:16:24] he walked into it
[1:16:28] praise the lord
[1:16:30] so he said i said it was a time because
[1:16:33] he was the type of the first adam and
[1:16:36] the second adam was god in flesh god
[1:16:39] that knew everything from the foundation
[1:16:41] of the word
[1:16:45] praise the lord so he knew it
[1:16:49] he knew what the price would be he knew
[1:16:51] he knew the evil that had been done
[1:17:04] but the misunderstanding was the thought
[1:17:06] that i said adam never seen
[1:17:09] but adam did sin
[1:17:11] but it did
[1:17:12] but he did it with his eyes wide open
[1:17:19] in timothy 3 they said that adam
[1:17:22] was not deceived that's what we read
[1:17:25] actually timothy 2
[1:17:27] but the woman being deceived was in the
[1:17:29] transgression
[1:17:31] see
[1:17:32] eve actually thought it was right she
[1:17:35] thought it was right
[1:17:37] but adam knew
[1:17:39] it was wrong yes
[1:17:45] but satan deceived her
[1:17:47] but he he didn't deceive adam he knew it
[1:17:51] was wrong
[1:17:53] but because of the love of his wife
[1:17:56] which is the redemptive rob
[1:17:59] [Laughter]
[1:18:01] amen
[1:18:03] because of the love of his wife
[1:18:06] which is the redemptive rob
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:13] and i believe also
[1:18:15] a woman can extend that redemptive rob
[1:18:18] on her husband i believe parents can
[1:18:21] stand a redemptive rob on their children
[1:18:23] i believe christians can extend their
[1:18:25] redemptive love on sinners
[1:18:36] praise the lord
[1:18:39] he knew he was wrong but because of the
[1:18:41] love of his wife he
[1:18:43] he represented himself with sin
[1:18:46] and was condemned by the sin
[1:18:51] praise the lord
[1:18:53] he represented himself with sin and was
[1:18:55] condemned
[1:18:56] by the same
[1:19:00] oh my
[1:19:04] are we together
[1:19:07] praise the lord
[1:19:14] i mean some
[1:19:16] sometimes
[1:19:17] like i said people just get into the
[1:19:20] surface of the scripture and and and
[1:19:22] sometimes the way people would talk
[1:19:24] about this
[1:19:25] you know uh uh and and and uh they just
[1:19:29] they make eve to just be a kind of a
[1:19:32] filtered woman you know they make her to
[1:19:35] be a seducer they make her to be no she
[1:19:38] was deceived
[1:19:40] that's what the scripture said
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:45] if she was not deceived she would not do
[1:19:48] it
[1:19:50] when the serpent approached her what she
[1:19:52] knew was what she said
[1:19:55] no the lord god told us not not to even
[1:19:58] touch it she defended the word
[1:20:04] the lord
[1:20:06] so she was not walking around his uh
[1:20:08] skin tight she was not doing things to
[1:20:11] seduce the serpent she was deceived
[1:20:25] are we together
[1:20:29] now you will see
[1:20:31] why paul in romans chapter 5 let's go
[1:20:34] there
[1:20:37] in romans chapter 5
[1:20:45] paul being the prophet of god
[1:20:47] he's holding the word of god which is
[1:20:49] god's justice
[1:20:51] so in romans chapter 5
[1:20:54] verse 17
[1:20:55] the bible says
[1:21:01] amen
[1:21:13] from verse 12 wherefore as by one man
[1:21:16] sin enter into the word and death by sin
[1:21:20] by one man now you see all true year
[1:21:24] romans chapter 5 the book of
[1:21:26] justification you rea you realize that
[1:21:30] paul never mentioned a woman
[1:21:34] he never said but one woman seen enter
[1:21:36] the word
[1:21:40] why because she was the thief
[1:21:42] this is the man that was guilty the one
[1:21:45] that had his eyes open and went into
[1:21:48] doing the wrong he was the one that was
[1:21:50] guilty
[1:21:56] praise the lord
[1:22:01] all glory be to god
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:05] don't come tell me about the one i was
[1:22:06] deceived
[1:22:14] praise the lord
[1:22:16] unless you are wanting to be deceived
[1:22:20] oh brother why i was deceived
[1:22:24] praise the lord
[1:22:26] i mean if eve knew what you knew
[1:22:30] if eve knew what you have been taught
[1:22:34] she wouldn't have done what happened
[1:22:37] so don't come to me and tell me say i
[1:22:39] was deceived
[1:22:44] or taken in
[1:22:45] as as your car to play
[1:22:52] now so paul said as as by one man sin
[1:22:55] entered into the word and death by sin
[1:22:59] and saw death passed on to all men one
[1:23:03] man
[1:23:04] and that man was adam
[1:23:06] praise the lord
[1:23:08] one man
[1:23:10] all glory be to god tonight are we
[1:23:13] together
[1:23:19] for until the lord
[1:23:22] seen
[1:23:23] sin was in the word but uh sin was not
[1:23:27] imputed when there was no law now so you
[1:23:30] see paul
[1:23:31] is dealing with this by the law of god
[1:23:36] he's dealing with this by the lord of
[1:23:38] god not by
[1:23:40] uh uh that i'm not he knows everything
[1:23:43] about genesis what happened the center
[1:23:45] the the the serpent was more he used
[1:23:48] that in the book of of corinthians just
[1:23:51] like the septuagint deceived e the
[1:23:53] serpent is deceiving the church he used
[1:23:55] that but yet he's looking at the law of
[1:23:59] god
[1:24:00] when you hold the lord of god the lord
[1:24:03] of god must be more gracious
[1:24:05] to the one that was deceived
[1:24:10] because him that sin willfully after he
[1:24:13] had received the knowledge of the truth
[1:24:17] they remain a normal sacrifice
[1:24:20] praise the lord
[1:24:22] you see that's the reason why adam had
[1:24:25] to find a fake leaf
[1:24:27] he did not he cannot bring any more
[1:24:29] sacrifice that will be accepted god had
[1:24:32] to provide one for him
[1:24:39] praise the lord
[1:24:41] amen
[1:24:45] glory be to god
[1:24:47] amen
[1:24:52] but when it came to christ he himself
[1:24:54] was the sacrifice
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:24:58] why because he took on sin he identified
[1:25:02] with sin but sin never corrupted his
[1:25:05] blood
[1:25:09] he associated himself with the people he
[1:25:12] became the friend of sinners he was our
[1:25:14] redeemer the lover of our soul but it
[1:25:17] did not corrupt him
[1:25:21] so he became his sacrifice
[1:25:28] praise the lord
[1:25:30] god could look upon him and see the sin
[1:25:34] of the word
[1:25:35] and god could look upon him and also see
[1:25:38] the sacrifice of the word
[1:25:43] oh glory be to god
[1:25:46] by one man sin entered into the word
[1:25:49] nevertheless death reigned from from
[1:25:51] adam to moses
[1:25:54] even all of them that that are nothing
[1:25:57] after the similarities of adam's
[1:25:59] transgression now you see he's using the
[1:26:01] same word
[1:26:03] that he said the woman was in the
[1:26:04] transgression he's bringing that same
[1:26:07] war here to adam
[1:26:17] after adam's transgression
[1:26:19] who is a figure of him that was to come
[1:26:23] which is christ
[1:26:25] but not as the offense
[1:26:28] so also is the free gift
[1:26:33] verse 16
[1:26:34] and that as it was by one that seen it
[1:26:38] so is the gift
[1:26:42] for the judgment
[1:26:44] was by one
[1:26:46] to condemnation
[1:26:49] for
[1:26:50] about one man offends death reign by one
[1:26:53] much more they which receive abundance
[1:26:56] of grace
[1:26:58] and of the gift of righteousness shall
[1:27:00] reign in life by one
[1:27:04] so you see where we're going tonight
[1:27:08] well that taught off
[1:27:11] the redemptive rob
[1:27:16] verbatim goes down he says and christ
[1:27:20] represented himself with his church
[1:27:23] full of sin and was condemned and his
[1:27:25] soul went to hell
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:29] and god raised him up on the teddy
[1:27:33] you believe that
[1:27:34] see it wasn't
[1:27:37] it wasn't dead
[1:27:40] he did sin
[1:27:43] it wasn't that he didn't sin he did sin
[1:27:47] god
[1:27:49] who have seen him who have sent him to
[1:27:52] hell hell a god wouldn't have sent him
[1:27:55] to hell pill
[1:27:58] he had to send him to hell condemned
[1:28:02] because he took our sin upon him
[1:28:06] praise the lord
[1:28:14] and christ died
[1:28:16] not righteous christ died as sinner see
[1:28:20] christ
[1:28:21] never seen it himself but he took our
[1:28:24] sin on him
[1:28:27] he says any scriptural
[1:28:30] theologian
[1:28:31] teacher will know about
[1:28:34] the two gods
[1:28:36] and he comes back there now while god
[1:28:39] told moses
[1:28:40] about the scapegoat
[1:28:45] they take one goat they kill it put the
[1:28:47] blood on the other one and let him to go
[1:28:49] free
[1:28:52] praise the lord so christ was the two
[1:28:55] gods
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:02] he was the guilty god
[1:29:05] and he was the sacrificial god
[1:29:12] are we together
[1:29:14] you see how the picture is coming
[1:29:16] together
[1:29:17] that's the redemptive rob
[1:29:24] people say the devil is escaped well he
[1:29:26] said no
[1:29:28] christ was both gods
[1:29:31] both death and resurrection
[1:29:34] amen
[1:29:35] he was both death
[1:29:37] and resurrection
[1:29:40] hallelujah
[1:29:42] so you see resurrection is now only
[1:29:46] an evening
[1:29:48] resurrection is a person
[1:29:53] that was what jesus tried to make matter
[1:29:56] to understand
[1:30:00] or merit to understand if you were here
[1:30:02] my brother wouldn't have died
[1:30:07] he said amen
[1:30:08] he will live again she said yes i know
[1:30:11] in the resurrection she was looking at
[1:30:12] the evening
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:15] and he
[1:30:16] said no resurrection is not only uneven
[1:30:19] resurrection is a person
[1:30:21] i am the resurrection
[1:30:26] and the life
[1:30:30] praise the lord
[1:30:32] so you see
[1:30:33] there we we we we find that he
[1:30:36] represented death and resurrection
[1:30:40] glory be to god
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:44] he had to die and and and rise again
[1:30:51] it was not just
[1:30:53] taking our sin upon him going on a cross
[1:30:56] and being nailed and suffering but he
[1:30:58] actually had to die
[1:31:03] because when the sea fall into the
[1:31:04] ground they have to die
[1:31:08] to genetize and come back up again
[1:31:12] and that's what god is doing in us
[1:31:14] it's not just joining the church it's
[1:31:16] not just uh no you you have that that
[1:31:20] seed have to die
[1:31:22] amen now all men have to die
[1:31:27] praise the lord
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:29] anything of the flesh have to die
[1:31:32] anything of the sinful nature and sinful
[1:31:35] desire you have to die
[1:31:44] oh what a mighty god we self
[1:31:47] what a resurrection rob
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] let me close this up tonight
[1:31:58] noah christ was both gods he was both
[1:32:00] death and resurrection you see
[1:32:04] and he bought i was i i was seen away
[1:32:08] and and and then uh
[1:32:11] come forth
[1:32:13] in the resurrection
[1:32:15] and so
[1:32:16] it was christ being represented
[1:32:21] for the church
[1:32:22] he took the church place for sin and was
[1:32:26] cast
[1:32:27] into ultra darkness
[1:32:30] in hell and rose again on the tear day
[1:32:34] praise the lord now see brother branham
[1:32:36] says something that you enjoy let's
[1:32:38] let's let's let's go quickly yeah
[1:32:40] he said rose again on the tear did god
[1:32:42] raise him up for our justification
[1:32:44] that's what paul is talking right here
[1:32:46] in romans chapter five
[1:32:47] he says and he he did that
[1:32:52] on the basis of one scripture
[1:32:56] he rose christ on the basis
[1:32:59] of one scripture
[1:33:01] you know and brother branham said that
[1:33:03] scripture was a backslider
[1:33:06] preacher or a box fly the man
[1:33:14] david in his backslaughter state
[1:33:17] and said lord i know you will not leave
[1:33:19] my soul in hell
[1:33:26] praise the lord
[1:33:28] glory be to god
[1:33:32] you see how god is mindful of us amen
[1:33:37] however state is now when we are on when
[1:33:40] we are on fire you know and we are
[1:33:42] revelating we are jumping up in the
[1:33:44] church and shouting all even when we are
[1:33:47] in the lower state and we are struggling
[1:33:49] and our heart is pouring out to god oh
[1:33:52] god i love you i need you
[1:33:55] he's my fault of that
[1:33:57] it attracts him
[1:34:00] it speaks to him
[1:34:11] one scripture of a minister who lit up
[1:34:13] backslided
[1:34:16] spoke the scripture david said i will
[1:34:18] not leave his soul in hell neither will
[1:34:20] i suffer my holy one to seek corruption
[1:34:24] praise the lord
[1:34:26] you see david year
[1:34:29] honor inspiration
[1:34:33] he says something
[1:34:34] crying out it's not it's not
[1:34:36] premeditated
[1:34:39] sometimes people pre-meditate to
[1:34:41] convince god that they are already sorry
[1:34:43] without pouring out their heart
[1:34:47] praise the lord
[1:34:49] he was pouring out his heart crying to
[1:34:51] god
[1:34:55] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:34:58] take not your spirit away from me you
[1:35:00] are he was actually pouring out inside
[1:35:02] crying to god
[1:35:04] lord i really need you
[1:35:09] praise the lord
[1:35:11] but you see when david said this he said
[1:35:14] it in prophecy
[1:35:17] amen
[1:35:18] david
[1:35:19] being
[1:35:21] a shepherd born and being a man after
[1:35:24] god on heart that loved the lord
[1:35:27] he knew there was going to be a messiah
[1:35:29] but you see when david said this he was
[1:35:31] not thinking about the messiah
[1:35:35] it was not the messiah that was on his
[1:35:37] mind
[1:35:40] what was on his mind was the condition
[1:35:43] he was in
[1:35:47] he needed god back he needed god so
[1:35:50] desperately
[1:35:52] he wanted to go back to his all-time
[1:35:54] path his all-time prayer meeting his
[1:35:56] dedication to the word
[1:36:01] he was not thinking about the messiah oh
[1:36:03] you will not leave his soul in hell no
[1:36:06] he said lord you will not leave your
[1:36:08] holy one in hell
[1:36:10] so take not your holy spirit from me
[1:36:18] praise the lord
[1:36:20] he was crying to god and and and pouring
[1:36:23] out his heart to god
[1:36:24] but yet
[1:36:25] in the midst of that
[1:36:30] it was a prophecy
[1:36:31] because you see
[1:36:33] christ was
[1:36:35] the first fruit
[1:36:37] amen
[1:36:38] he was the first fruit
[1:36:41] from the dead
[1:36:43] that never saw corruption
[1:36:45] but you see after the resurrection of
[1:36:48] jesus christ
[1:36:50] no believer ever see corruption
[1:36:54] we don't see corruption
[1:36:57] why because we leave the body
[1:37:01] when it corrupts in the earth
[1:37:08] is the body that corrupts not the
[1:37:10] believer that corrupts
[1:37:13] that's right
[1:37:19] are we together
[1:37:22] but that was on
[1:37:24] the prayer
[1:37:27] that was on the prayer
[1:37:30] of one
[1:37:32] man that needed god so much
[1:37:36] that needed god
[1:37:38] so much
[1:37:40] praise lord
[1:37:44] saints
[1:37:45] let not this word
[1:37:47] just be a head knowledge
[1:37:53] where we love to hear certain things
[1:37:55] we love it being said certain way
[1:37:59] and yet we are far from the reality
[1:38:02] of god
[1:38:03] in our hearts
[1:38:06] when it really comes down to our desire
[1:38:10] when our preferences are laid on the
[1:38:12] table
[1:38:13] the desire for god and the holy ghost is
[1:38:16] at the end
[1:38:18] when we lay our preferences on the table
[1:38:21] what we would really want in this life
[1:38:23] the holy ghost is at the end
[1:38:28] because it had just become a concept to
[1:38:31] us
[1:38:38] it had just become a concept
[1:38:46] praise the lord
[1:38:58] the redemptive rob
[1:39:01] think about it
[1:39:03] he became sin for us
[1:39:06] a holy god knowing the justice of his
[1:39:09] word
[1:39:12] ignoring the justice of his word
[1:39:17] think about barabras
[1:39:22] i was looking for the gospel of barabas
[1:39:27] thing about barabas
[1:39:30] he knew that he was condemned
[1:39:35] he knew
[1:39:36] that the roman law condemned him to
[1:39:39] death and there was no way out
[1:39:43] he knew that
[1:39:46] praise the lord
[1:39:48] he knew that barabbas was not making
[1:39:50] plans
[1:39:52] for whatever
[1:39:54] he knew his fear his future
[1:39:57] ended right in that prison
[1:40:02] praise the lord
[1:40:07] he knew that's where his future ended
[1:40:12] because the romans was not going to
[1:40:13] spare him either
[1:40:17] for creating a religious riot
[1:40:23] a little bit to god
[1:40:35] but when barabas heard
[1:40:38] when barabas heard
[1:40:41] there was one that was going to take his
[1:40:44] place
[1:40:51] when he heard there was one
[1:40:54] that was going to take his place that he
[1:40:56] was actually going to be released
[1:41:02] you know the question in his mind who
[1:41:04] actually is this person
[1:41:07] who is this person
[1:41:10] praise the lord
[1:41:12] who is this person that is going to take
[1:41:14] my place
[1:41:18] you you me i'm going to be free
[1:41:24] you really mean i can start making plans
[1:41:28] for my life
[1:41:42] and that's the way we are
[1:41:47] that's where grace brought us from
[1:41:50] praise the lord
[1:41:56] being born in sin shipley in iniquity
[1:42:00] we will all be our bus
[1:42:05] we lie we cheat
[1:42:07] we lost
[1:42:15] but there was one
[1:42:20] praise lord
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:27] you think barabbas walk from that prison
[1:42:30] where he showed her up
[1:42:32] he was he was confused
[1:42:35] because to him he have already settled
[1:42:39] with death in his mind
[1:42:44] if he had children he had talked to them
[1:42:48] he have advised them don't be like your
[1:42:50] father
[1:42:52] go to school be a good boy
[1:42:58] give them all the advice
[1:43:03] he repented to his wife i'm very sorry i
[1:43:06] let you down
[1:43:19] musicians you can come up tonight
[1:43:25] but you think about it
[1:43:34] young people think about it tonight
[1:43:36] a lot of the things
[1:43:38] that grace
[1:43:40] that this rock

[1:44:08] being
[1:44:10] it's a life that wants to take you from
[1:44:12] your passions
[1:44:14] because now in your mind when you think
[1:44:16] about yourself and the way you think
[1:44:18] about your future how you're going to be
[1:44:20] a celebrity
[1:44:23] right now you feel to yourself that i
