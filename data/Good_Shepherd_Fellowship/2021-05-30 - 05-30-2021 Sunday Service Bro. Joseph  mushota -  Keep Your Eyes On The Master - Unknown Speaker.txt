[Music] brother then has a testimony brother then you are welcome praise the lord yes i have a short testimony and um what else i was thinking of the testimony another testimony just came it wasn't as if i forgot of it but i just didn't know where my mind was praise be to god yeah just listening to the first song we sang this morning because he lives i can face tomorrow and even coming to the second song we are standing on holy grounds and there are angels all around and the bible says that the angels of the lord and campeth run about them that fear him and wherever you find yourselves know that you are not alone the angel of the covenant is right there with you um i had a dream which one even goes first let me start from the back and go from yes when was that that was uh friday night into saturday i think we had already entered saturday we were sleeping and then danny came and woke us up i think it was probably after 12 midnight i'm not very sure 30 okay so he said gospel was not breathing well and then he went to his room and he saw that he was swollen all over and he asked gas well what is wrong with you and god says can't you see my eyes as well as swollen so he came to wake us up and then he's allergic to a lot of things so he had eaten something that previous night when nobody knows and it just surprises me anytime they are sick especially gasoline emanuel they will not call on you in the night don't wait till the following day and while you are talking to they say oh we didn't want to disturb your sleep and several times the american no just come and this voice would not do it so praise be to god danny want to use the restroom his room is not even closer to his room but he heard him and when he went he was swollen all over and he was struggling to breathe so his mother wanted to call 9-1-1 i said no let's pray we prayed and we took him to the hospital before we got there he was coughing and wheezing and what have you and then they went in they didn't allow me in but the mother went in with him and praised me to god that same night we went back home but i have been thinking about it if danny by the grace of god had not gone in at that century and this was going to sleep till the morning the following morning nobody knows what is going to happen but i know that the story was going to be very ugly and i just want to give god the glory for it and before then i had a dream on thursday that there was a shadow over me that was just fighting and i was just shouting the name jesus i was just shouting jesus i was and i shouted jesus so much that when i woke up out of sleep i was still shouting jesus and i could just still imagine that dark shadow in the room so um when i woke up normally i would get up around 4 a.m and pray and go to work i woke up around 4 00 a.m i prayed on my way to work on 4 94 when i was joining 6 94 right where the first accident almost happened right in that corner they are doing a lot of construction there was a semi that was in the outer lane i was inside and they have erected some bridges they are miniature um wolves with this heavy heavy concrete so i was inside and both of us were burning the corner so the head of the semi left his lane and came into my lane so now i was between the head of the semi and the wall and then the body was on the other side so i just shouted jesus and the head just went back to his lane and i overtook it and left it behind because i didn't want to deal with him anymore [Music] praise be to god now i was wondering later i said it was a thursday and another tuesday comes i said the same corner the same place and i said the same devil but praise be to god the same god was there to deliver me [Music] and i just want to encourage us wherever you find yourself in fact never leave home without prayer sometimes i will pray leave home and even in the truck i will pray till i get to work and pray before i go in you may never know what is going on never i don't care if you are late still find time to pray praise be to god for we are serving a living god and the god we are serving is interested in every single detail of our lives praise be to god amen shall glory yes yes yes see the bible say the mention of that name jesus every knee shall bow everything confess do you believe that this morning put your hands together for jesus all right we have we have a song special here this morning um sister dokas you are welcome we want to come and bless our hearts [Music] [Music] yourself holy spirit burning me set my heart on fire give me the power that jesus had and god's desire make me like the cries of old yielding and raising give me the power that jesus had through the blood our shed [Music] fill me with the holy ghost [Music] in the dead gave

place it in the bags all right let's go ahead and continue the song service sing jesus hold my hand as i leave me safely truly [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] messages [Music] [Applause] [Music]

up after that the right place we we should be happy when we're in the prince of the lord out there there is no hope but as we've got our hope when the world is going down but us we know after this life there is another life praise god thank you for the song reading i greet all in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you for coming thank you for brother ariel is there so our just thinking is not there the music is perfect we're just thinking of it even there is no music we are going to worship glory be to god god just say sent his hinge right at the other piano and things was okay perfect i feel like everything is there when i just oh there is missing it's the sound and every it's like the angel they were just singing with you cleveland glory be to god praise god amen amen so we come to commemorate the resurrection of the lord jesus christ this morning every sunday when we come it's for that we can become just to appreciate what god have done to us we don't come to be a christian no we come just to appreciate what he did what he's going to do because there is no one can protect like jesus there is no one can bless like jesus there is no one can he heal like jesus so this morning i will ask you one thing only one thing is forget your problem most of the time we can come in the church then we when as soon as we sit all the problem comes [Music] but when we are singing you feel like you forget your problem but when we start to enter in the very essential and important part of the service the problem comes and the sleepness you feel like you want to sleep but when they give you now say sister brother there is a room they go and sleep go out you won't sleep so ask you this morning what make you to sleep i would say my wife you can be just okay we came from home as soon as they start to preach it's like a blanket come what's wrong with this body this body is always against the spirit of god you have to know that you you must reach that level that this body is full of nonsense that's why i don't give it everything this body ask you this body is full of nonsense enemy of joseph is joseph himself that's when you start to reach that level you will never have enemies because you are an ego you can handle any situation any circumstance it's work in your family everywhere you are an ego do you know the value of one converted soul is do you know that one converted so equal to ten thousand world that's why you have to know the value of yourself don't let nobody to fool on you say you are nothing don't tell nobody to say your god is nothing no come on you don't know how many people have protected any aeroplane because you were there you don't know how many people got protected in your neighborhood because you were there you don't know how many people got the protagonist work because you were there i always give a testimony when i give it to like people they don't you know sometimes i was telling brahmax one day we just fellowshipping i said it's okay vaccine it's okay i didn't say it's bad you can take it or not our receptive things what it's i'm sorry brother you you never say this this this this evangelist oh forget about how are you guys it's okay yeah just i didn't yet start preaching but if i want to sing i'll call you you know you know um i always i like to preach what is going on just right now in among us we can take about you can talk about devi goliath but abraham he did that time but the same code of pata branham is the same god is right yeah like gideon if you are a real god like azra's and the israel people they said just read for us what he did it's going to start to build up our faith ezra was a priest was not a prophet but like you you study a little bit you know how to read the bible just start reading has the message [Music] is your attitude in the front of the message can bring god on the scene is your attitude it's just that reading what god did and he started to read god did this god did this and he started to build up he started to build up their faith it because faith comes from a hearing hearing from the word of god that's why when you come here is to hear the word of god and that word will help you will build you will heal you and you give you hope and raise your faith and decrease the desire of the world in you and pick up the desire of the world in you claim the hand for the lord praise god we can stand up and read the word of god so it's okay i didn't forget my vaccine i'm gonna finish it praise the lord let us refresh the word yeah so i know when i say this brother what you want to say about the vaccine it's good myself if i like it i'm gonna take it three times but the one who's protecting us is a little jesus christ and the vaccine gave us hallelujah that's a real vaccine it's more their vaccines i'm going to give some story let's just read the bible we are going are you happy to be in the friends of the lord to help them for the lord amen amen forget your problem the master is right here the master is with us the master don't see your number don't say they're enjoying god is all over in his children is he with them and he is with us here we are going to enjoy his presence they are enjoying his presence he's the same god to them forever praise god let us read um can you read in luke chapter 5 4-11 luke chapter 5 4-11 are you there i'd like you to read with me because sometimes my accent like scientist sometimes there is a french accent in the english you know so if you read with me it will be better okay i'm reading uh luke chapter five from verse four to 11. now when he had left speaking he said unto simon lounge out into the dip and let down your net for a drop and the simon answering and said unto him master we have told all the night and i've taken nothing nevertheless at that world i will lay down the neck and when they had this done they include a great multitude of fishes and they are not break and they back they beckoned onto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and they helped them and they came and they filled both the ships so that they began to sink then simon perez saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man oh lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also james and john the son of zebedee which were partners with a salmon and jesus said unto simon fear not from huntsville thy shall catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and follow him shall we pray father god we invite you this morning oh god you take control of the service oh my god without you father we can do nothing in this world father somebody come from work straight father

presence in our minds lord we are not holy without you we don't claim our holiness lord we claim your holiness in us that's what it makes us holy father we are not perfect but we claim your perfection in us then we can be perfect oh lord the mountain father was not holy until god you come down in the mountain father and the mountain was holy when the holy one take over of some unholy that on holy become holy that's why we invite you the holiest of the holiest in this congregation father put me aside or king of kings joseph doesn't have nothing to give to the people joseph is not a preacher you

the people you can you can save you can heal you can prepare we come to there for a change change us lord change our behavior change our pride oh thank you papa because you are the one who can do it we commit everything in your hand this morning lord as this service when it's finished we are going to say god really spoke to us god heal us we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ we said amen maybe satan praise god i don't want to stick on my note this morning sometimes we do prepare we write we give quotations verses it's okay but sometimes we we just want a real god sometimes we have to ask ourselves since you believe the message if you just one time you just sit and ask yourself since you believe the message do you change are you changing why did you believe the message are you trying to ask yourself those questions and when you come from there and ask yourself why are you leaving how many people they died you know why god still keeping you that's why i never be absent to mind that when god put people on my way i always take advantage to fellowship and to talk because you don't know why put those people in your way sometimes god let us to go in the way you never thought you you are going to go that way why god allow you to go that way judge myself i was telling my wife i said sometimes when i'm talking to her she feels bad sometimes she can start crying i said baby maybe you misunderstand me i don't know maybe misunderstand sometimes i can say baby sometimes i feel like marriage is a vanity of vanity money is a vanity vanity the world is even working nothing i just feel like i just want to be in the bosom of the lord jesus christ maybe it means i'm not making i said no baby you're making me so happy i just want to leave you with you forever i love you but i'm talking about my lord understand me in the spiritual side you are my friend your best friend i have to share because sometimes you can see me i become indifferent i just want to be with god sometimes i don't want any what be filled with you i just want to be in the corner with god that's the i feel that way i feel that way it's uh i always stay with my my brother ariel that's i always preach what i'm going through what i talk with people because that's that's that's the preaching that's why when i don't have something to give you i won't preach to preach is you just surrender you talk you you listen to the inspiration you touch they touch the end we pray we can read the scripture scripture but sometimes we have to we have to ask ourselves where are we going where are we going with this message well and there's a message with this news you hear this pastor left the church that one this one that one killed that one all those bad news bad news bad news what are you doing about those news are you carrying those news now in the internet when you find a pastor back sliding now now you you become now it's you become a preacher now sister preacher brother preacher because of you hear the wrong instead of you hear those words you kneel down you start to cry amen you start to cry because this is something we never heard in the message if there is a waste things you never heard nonsense and there it is in the aware of the message i'm telling you right now we we can't we can't hide it some people they can't even come and visit us because they have those news but they forget there is a genuine weather is a fake there is also genuine before there is a there is a fake genuineness must be there first [Music] that's why you also you must be a spiritual to to judge right be spiritual to judge right because don't judge because of someone of tribe don't judge because of german country don't judge because of because because of judge because your spirit of discernment the spirit of god it judge the person according spirit that's it that's the discernment it's allow to the church not messianic discernment sister you came from i know your name your sister fetu no and you came from that is only brother branham i can give you quotations of that don't try that one don't try if someone is doing just give him a yes he'll collapse like no one business i'm telling in africa where i travel so people someone start to discern you know you know when you came from in the desert they come to me oh they just after him he was like his star i told him hey hey guys so what he's listening is correct i told him even the discernment it's correct one day it will get wrong do you know why brother branham he came from two sects but is a different of us his makeup yeah that one you have to know that's why some quotation we have to believe not to understand where the doctrine is today because you want to understand before you believe we have a problem eat the first the food now the vitamin in you gonna give you understanding that's why god raised someone didn't know how to write his name he put their pastor simon someone didn't study you are a pastor their pastor from this rock and he was the pastor of the church it's not about french or english or you how you can join eat ideas whatever but when you want to send someone to the greek does their intellect he send the pro he knows how to do things because paul was very intelligent you can't play with his mind he can enter in your mathematics he come out with the word hallelujah amen but when he sent paul there they will put him in the corner that's the way god knows but poor if peter was a pastor of paul but one day paul correct fear and the people say amen hallelujah that's the holy spirit we want to have knowledge holy spirit to give you become proud when you feel proud that's not the holy spirit is a ghost [Applause] he's the ghost we need the holy spirit can it break you down you know the holy spirit can you change your behavior you know the spirit can it change you completely when you see dennis coming back i kneel down i cry he's not the force of his mother or his father is the lord jesus christ dealing with you young brother when i just said young brother you just come and sit you don't know you don't want to do anything you just sit surrender no one can change we preach in many years we preach tell yes we pray four years we make hypocrite in the bench long skate they remove the sitting dead don't change why because we met this message at the rules rule and regulations in the message in our church in our church but when the pastor is doing nonsense you don't want to say anything you hide if there is a people that are doing more nonsense in this message is the preachers being the puppet and they don't want to hear that and you you can't say anything because as we forgot to speak us you hear us you can't say anything there is somebody god who is saying will condemn them will condemn us will condemn you through god not a person but god always uses somebody this morning stand with the lord there is no one can he left behind this message there is no one is on top of the message the message is god himself what you have to know is to put god at his place to put your prophet brahm at his place to put yourself at this place that you can grow up joseph what is your secret my secret is i believe the message from god through is the seventh william marion that is making me like this this character came from there because i told my wife if they remove a prophet in your in your way we become a denomination a pentecostal you have to leave bran number if isaac if rebecca left isaac on the way she's not gonna meet isaac she must stick with isaac until she met she must stick with eliezer until she met to meet isaac that's the big mistake we are doing in the in the assemblies some they kick branham out someday worshipping him but the bride you must walk on the middle just balance trust the lord just balance is a wind it's a storm branagh is not god brahma is god what time is it good i was saying but i was telling my wife one day she called me he said there is one brother preached it declared that how absolute is a brother branham you know i always preach what i'm living i always preach what i'm talking to my wife and when i come here it's that's me if you don't take it it's up to you i always say because it can help one soul they're there if it doesn't help you put aside when the chicken is not okay you you just take a meat and whatever bonzo throw it away we don't force you but there is somebody's helping him you see so i i i spoke to her i said is the way he said and is a stranger in the church you don't know the church you bring a raw quotation but there is a way i told him brother branham himself one day i'll give that quotation because i didn't know that i was going to preach to them but it's okay and he said my absolute is the bible that's brother branham my absolute is the bible i know you take me as your absolute it didn't say don't take me i know you are taking me as your absolute follow me as i follow that's it that's it you like or not that's the things are if you want to grab yourself it's yourself that's the quotation exactly what he said i give to you so now the way you can present to the people and the way you people you take it right me if someone said that me someone came and start to preach pranam god he will never shake me i'll just look at him and finish if he just smile i said you understand very wrong wrong but is to yeah i know that spirit is not easy only god can take those people when the spirit can catch you you have to run away i don't know if me i can't but god can i know yes so our telling is the way you take it yeah so the the god is god of solution god is god of healing so your attitude towards the world that's where god deal with you no matter you know no matter how the situation is hard but if you just realize that god allowed he knows why he allowed yeah sometimes ask me say you're not okay it's like you are sick you painful you you always say you are fine i said babe i'm okay he allow this pain and this in my body he knows why he allow it's good for me praise the lord hallelujah there's nothing i can do i just praise the lord there is a some i told her there's a sometimes god to shambok you for the wrong way you did hallelujah say amen there is a sometimes they just just just a trial you didn't do anything and when is shamboku you know now you know that is a shambokyou and take equals as a dad when you do wrong hey come back on the way praise the lord if you took our son there you beat him he's going out no in the evening he come back don't do it again yes that's our god you know you must fall in love with him follow you love of god and appreciate what god have given you first before complaining you always complain you don't appreciate you don't say amen for what he gave already what do you want god to do for you just a breath of life it's it's it's a miracle when you just drive to come and reach here you know the attitude to say thank you it's very good even to the people you have to say thank you you have to appreciate the you good character i would fight with my my my friends by max when i throw flowers no brother brother it's okay i don't enter in your details but brother branham said we have to throw a flower when someone is still alive amen preacher is not good it's not easy to catch you you always just come scriptures no sir no that's the word encouraging him for the good is doing you you don't say nothing one is doing good you are just waiting for wrong which spirit do you have something good to say about a brother or sister keep quiet we have this wonderful message wonderful good one that was sitting one day we took brother one i said i've preached i'll go around mission at work do this there's one thing i just want the perfect will of god and i was telling my wife be ready i don't know where god is going to send us babe where do you want us to go i said i don't know i don't know most of the time when you sing when you lead are we follow when you lead how we fall why are you seeing that why are you saying that now when he start to lead you start to resist not to malawi i want to stay in america not to malaga oh i love the lord i never know this morning do you love him praise god come on church praise god [Applause] [Music] oh wonderful god this message is powerful this might just change me completely it just remove all the desire for the world out [Music] so i just that's how i'm trying to prepare my wife to come in my boat because i said because if i go higher than you you should be too much misunderstanding so i'm pulling my baby come on baby i love you crossing my baby come on come come up let us go i don't understand so you don't understand you just eat you

you just i know you love the word that's why you are here i love the word just pray for me i really want god more than before i really when i hear because you know us preacher we must have the information the news we have to to help you it's not we have to know no we have to know it because sometimes things coming on and you don't understand let me finish the vaccine come back if i forget vaccine i like it oh vaccine ah but abraham said he must be vaccinated right so um how does it work i know how i say i want to say it again for him it sunk in you if you challenge god god the love challenge i'm telling you don't fear it's not you are going to protect them it's not what you are going to do it he's going to do it and the problem is don't say it because i say no you say it because you you it comes from you you become of one that it's that inspiration and that's why when we are in the church when the inspiration come pray here don't feel ashamed my sister or my brother gonna see me crying cry [Music] pray you know me when i'm there i'm not alone oh we are glory to people they said this is crazy brother i am for christ [Music] god love that most of the time we choose people than god and especially to work you don't want them to know that you're a christian you're smart okay and when you ask he delay you you start to cry you also you delay him to declare in front of the

ready praise the lord i just love you so much sage you're so wonderful you love the lord i can feel how you are pulling that's where we know that you love the lord sometimes you struggle you feel like they are rejecting and when they start to reject and you know what do most those day television don't take me wrong it's up to you but most of the time that changed a lot of people they've got to televisions they come with a spirit of television the church that's my experience when they watch television all night like saturday a lot of movies nice they don't have time to pray they come with that spirit in the church you struggle to preach that's the truth i'm telling you so you feel it now when i feel that heaviness as you i changed the preaching you watch so much television yesterday and you start to give us a problem and to travel to preach but abraham said when you want to apply the token kick out of newspaper kick out the wrong books kick out to tv and apply the token so i change and i bring it away and when you they they wake up they say go to el paso and you come back the spirit is right and you start to preach cleveland for the lord but you guys i can feel most of people they they they are genuine you can feel it there are sometimes i want to read you pull me i'll go back since i want to read always good let me read hallelujah clapton for the lord i love to preach this kind of church you are just free you feel they are pulling i'm very happy for that so instead of struggling but sometimes when god sent you there may be one soul for you you know i just pray for that soul and god praise god are you happy to be in the presence of the lord clapton dew fellow the children of god you are so good praise god i'm reading in a um [Music] jordan i know i gave

our men our men man-made organization man-made religion is still fig trees from the garden of eden it's never work until man is born again the spirit of god and the ever eternal life in them ministers friends i'm talking to much of your time but i want to say this before living leave this with you as your brother one who loves you now just remember this remark before leaving not long ago there was a grey man a master young fellow and oh how he could play he just swapping the world with his music he was a star people they all used to love him and he was a great artist of eight so one night he was entertaining many thousands of people in a certain nation england and they were so amazed to the great master around everywhere and the people were after he had played this concert all his music they were screaming and clapping there clapping their hands and going white but they notice the young men pay no attention to their uploading keep looking up clap the hand for the lord praise the lord they were screaming and oh just carrying on as loud as they could to let them let him know that they appreciate his music that he was a genius but he kept looking up and the one that that he was looking at were way up in the top balcony the old master teacher and clamped up there he was keeping his eyes is to wonder what the master teacher was going to say about it he didn't care that they said it's what the teacher was saying the old master teacher clap the hand for the lord amen i finished ministers of the gospel let's not notice this big campaign and uploading of the people keep your eyes on the master for he's the holy one who can raise us up in that day praise the lord and my title this morning is keep your eyes on the master oh praise the lord i was putting a foundation now we are going to the preaching hallelujah for the lord amen amen keep your eyes onto the master we read the scripture master uh fisher i can call it fisher it's fishing it's a fish all right it's fishing fish that's fishing right i don't know it's okay fish and it was fishing fish simon all his life that was his work jesus never fish and he was a master of fishing they tried that day they couldn't have nothing so i want to tell you this morning you try your way you try your mind you try your tricks your techniques you fail and when you fail when you reach a level where you can't that's the way he can clap then for the lord peter was a fishing fishing fish nothing and they just discouraged the fishing nothing and they said master we tried we couldn't but because you're a master let me throw my night because of your word where there isn't nothing so tell me what happened they hear the fish they just hear this their voice of the creator come and go that side god is more than able to heal your sickness god is more than able to change your life god is more than able to help you this morning the god of william branham is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same god who protected daniel in the lion pain in the same god who protect the tree hero in the fire that fire didn't burn them that fire burned the boundary there was a free walking in the fire and the ac oh good hair was in the fire it was a wonderful temperature they feel like they don't wanna even come out of faith because the master of the wind was there the creator of the heavens what they [Applause] the problem is sometimes as preachers we are very proud just to say sorry i'm against us because that's most no sense people are doing now behind this puppet most today are preachers that's why don't worry god is in your side too don't complain because as we don't say anything god always take side for each children god always speak myself i need help you need the help when i'm here i'm preaching to myself it doesn't mean when i'm in front of i'm more than you no ways i need god i need your prayer i need the grace the way you need to he just give me a ministry something i can preach with her to help me and to help you and i say god protect my life if i don't live i'm not going to preach i didn't choose you you have chosen me help me to leave my salmon if i say i'm not living wrong i will never preach i'll sit you will kill me i didn't write it later i'm a preacher you have chosen me to help me to stay in and to give the life because it take life to life no life there is no life god bless you [Applause] ask yourself since you believe the message you know sometimes they take advantage don't speak wrong your brother does become a sister the brother came in our midst he become like a wolf it's not to play with our sisters and you just keep quiet don't speak wrong about brothers you misunderstand that scripture that brother you have to kick him out of the church yeah and before we take him out we have to talk we can't give out quiet we don't want to talk no no we talk about it so don't misunderstand the scripture don't the scripture are clear that's why when we judge we have to judge with the right spirit you have to check your motive are you judging base of what are you judging based of the scripture or are you judging best of your understanding or your hatred because you add those people and you put them in the group if someone you looked at them all of them they are the same wrong god got his children everywhere god is going to take one by one everywhere we don't know where they are that's why sometimes we invite maybe the last one can come and we can go to the rapture clap the hand for the lord praise god [Applause] efficient night you didn't find anything then according to your word the master it wrong and the result was there what is it isa it surrender is knowledge isarenda is bright it surrender what he thought that he knew he's a the tactics i can call it and he said god help me this morning i know i was a sinner said by grace and when he saw the hand of the lord he kneeled down you see just go away from me i'm man of you know you see humbleness you see harmonies so when you so you see god doing something if it wasn't my prayer you can't you know i prayed you didn't heal him god uses him even if you didn't pray there is an another person is going to pray amen if he's not me who are you you're dust you are nothing just a dust also only him make you if he just pull away that breath of life i'm going to breathe we're going to bury you so what what why that pride why when the husband says something demons or sister god help you to calm down let your husband to your husband be a wife that's the blessing brother you also don't don't be a soldier in the message sister in the kitchen no see is you your pardon she's your friend balance we have to balance everyone must stay at this place it's a love love love love it doesn't even see the mistake you just love you don't know why that's what i always say if people you know joseph branham is a brother like me brother branham is a brother like me but is my prophet is brother branham say joseph a prophet i say amen i stop there once you i have to check which kind of a prophet joseph is what he's going to do with you in your faith you're wasting your time he said he's a prophet keep quiet he's a prophet move on we have only one prophet of the age by the brahmanam that's it sometimes i can follow joseph joseph himself he doesn't have a problem he's the people they have a problem his people they misunderstand him and they can't help them because they wanted someone misunderstand it takes god to help oh joseph they must know to preach no jesus never said we must not preach but he say plague the tape you want also to listen that's why sometimes pastor warner put the tape because you must get used to malachi 4. it help us to come back on the line malachi 4 don't ever don't allow don't allow malachi to go out of your way you will never get wrong you'll be like a pentecostal you can't even have something to say what to make us of success to preach you can just preach three hours without refreeding is the message though i don't cult because it's the message i eat i eat i pray i become the message walking they are late grab them for the lord [Applause] this message is powerful this message can change because the one who preach this message is not brother branham is the angel so when you put in your mind that is the angel then you understand when you approach brother branham you don't see brother branham you press the the flesh you enter inside you see the hello him amen that was in the brother branham one day medal was just cracked the hand good they don't trap he didn't know it was the hinge you said they want the angel was displeased i can't help you honey i love you but to him praise the lord but him my best friend but abraham was the best friend of the lord that's why sometimes can come in the campaign i don't need your help we are okay i come to help you because he knows money it's always distort this this step and they destroy the ministry though they need money for the campaign they need the money to travel but some companies no no don't make the offering no no please i don't need your money it's okay keep it help others because it could detect as the prophet you know why the prophet when he was born is the subconscious and conscience is december place you and i your subconscious and conscience are separate you to dream you must sleep but the problem to dream he must not sleep it can just be breath a break in the dream it breaks to the other world he started to dream that vision that's what i said when the dream is fulfilled it becomes a vision it is something he just vice versa it's the way it comes now brother branham is the prophet of the age when the discernment came from the devil is makeup it could detect the origin of the discernment now i'm explaining to you why when someone start to do this messianic discernment you have to run away sometimes people they like is telling me what happened i'm okay me even if you tell me i don't care what my past for what and he can give it to the devil can you take the past god he doesn't you see it he forgive you he throw it in the sea of forgiveness he doesn't deceit the devil is busy reminding you your past and you keeping on your past when god doesn't see thee so you are clean for the lord [Applause] so but the brother could see the origin of the discernment though it can be correct but is can you see what it came from because the devil also can bring stuff in the past so he can know how to reject to take what it came from god that's why i said it's never fail because it was god himself bringing it when the devil tried it doesn't it can because his makeup subconscious and his conscience is a seer is a sea it means you you are down someone tell you the thief they are coming you you don't see there is a war and you have to say amen you don't see sister and brother you don't you must just follow hey so that they they see that they saw the enemy they are coming so when they see i said you start to correct now you know he's a man when he was talking about this this is what run away from those people it's intimate they are talking wrong about the message they are trying to discourage you they are trying to destroy your faith this message is a life this message is a powerful this message is money this message is wife his husband this message is it is bright i saw it in and out i'm telling you by experience and there is everything but abraham will preach in everything even how to raise our children he said when the mother beat the kid and the kid is does something wrong and you a father you know your kid does something wrong when [Music] you also the dad must beat him you must listen to the mother mother of the tunnel we don't do that those are the small stuff it destroys your children they become impolite they grow up and in this country you can't beat them they become you don't know what to do with them in the message there is everything you need to grow up how you can educate the children they are in the message read the message read listen to the message it must be when you wake up you read your bible listen it's help you more you listen to the message more you have a knowledge more to help your faith how many times you don't even listen to the message it's become boring maybe sometimes you put the message it become like a song you don't even listen what the they're saying the message the message is god talking to you so this morning i'm encouraging you change so i'm asking you since when you come to church what is your vision what do you feel when you sit you come you pray what do you want to be coming yourself why did you believe the message i come back again to that question if you try that time that you just sit you say god i don't know why you brought me here what is my position why am i here did you try to ask god for that you have to do that clapton for the lord amen amen praise the lord are you tired i don't want you to sleep me if people start to sleep some people they can continue no no no no something's wrong let us pray we can stand up and start praying for the lord amen praise the lord we are going somewhere this message is the message of the hour is taking us to heaven we are already in heaven a place in christ jesus hallelujah you know all those words is not just a slogan that that anointing you will never get it out of the word never you know there is a such good presence like we are sitting here we come in we pray we listen to the message we sing you will never get our house for the message or out of the church like this that's not that's why when that announcing comes that's the way you have to pray you you take that anointing that's why one day by brahmana said see i'm wrinkling my eyes because of the girl she's just entering in the church i'm happy to see rebecca coming in because of this anointing in the church she can receive the holy spirit it was in 1965 he's talking about his daughter rebecca so you you can see that but the prana was a prophet but didn't they have the power to leave to give the holy spirit to rebecca if you take the anointing at the place you create that's why we sing we pray for that anointing when god come down then he can attach your soul and to serve you that's why you must take advantage one way in his presence forget about your neighbor don't be shy it's come for all of us sometimes you feel like i just feel like coming in the front city like this you feel like doing just crazy ah let me just stand up you're just old but my heart was just going to sleep i don't know if i was feeling that's today it's okay it's okay it's okay we are crazy for god so sometimes is a fight you must go against this body if you feel too shy just clean [Music] you feel something you are nothing this other you can clean i feel it's a baby just a seat i'm going to wash my plate hallelujah you are breaking this body all of us you are tired she came from work i came from work i must help her it doesn't because she's a wife because message said he must be in the kitchen and you you sitting there and then she must not work you would go and work all the bills pay yourself she's helping you hey boss i'm hungry go and cook yourself she's tired too come on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's about friendship if you want to succeed in the marriage i always advise people try to be friend with your wife this sister you can integrate they are powerful don't play with them if they want to destroy if they can destroy you you are just sitting there with your dictatorship you are dying be friendly with them they are sweet heart they're your sweet dads your chocolate leave them for the lord [Applause] praise god you know what when you make your home heaven even if you come out from work you are very fast driving to see your wife of your husband make your home heaven don't make your home hell brother sister come on what's wrong when someone give a wronger advertising don't take it take the message of the hour there's everything you just overcome when you feel like that thing doesn't go go faster down you on his father you know i can't do it help me lord i'm just your daughter you know my husband's not to be having funny hold on my wife want to just break right that's only where you can sort it out your

what about your character of your husband he can change him like that we can change everything he's god of god he's god of things he's the god of miracles if he can stop the sun the sun will stop he can stop the behavior of your wife you're the son of your husband it's the same today that bill of fire you see in the picture is right here when you preach writings in the right time god is among us

people they they they give them those people they are cleaning the church you do that sometimes we just take a fast you pray for them just they soon just just come and clean the church and you put them in your in your prayer and you said god help them you know the secret if you notice in many services of brother branham he always said don't pray for yourself pray for the neighbor you don't know the secret when you are praying for your neighbor you are praying for yourself you just apply the principle god create gold silver everything is for him why he tells you to pay 10 10 percent god is poor why is a principle god put upon the earth it just tell you to activate those principles then all principle will answer back to yourself that's it you don't pay tight you to put yourself in a case under case up to you the principal block you pay tithe the principle open believer not believer go to the principle that's why you don't understand this one is living wrong he doesn't even know god is a prosperous material it's about material it's not about heaven he open he assists the principle sir will you say you know god but you do you don't apply the principle of your father you will become a thief and god reminded you white teeth you wear over you cleveland for the lord i don't always touch this i was very happy when i my wife when we just talked he always pay from the gross i said this was going a fight if she was not going to tighten because she's bringing prophet in my house yeah i always say thank you and most of them when i saw it but you always say thank god i say no some sister is a fight when they just saw that salary stand there they don't wanna allow you to remove even if one dollar you know we have debt we have look for another money for titan you don't have a problem shoes we give brother that sister is putting poverty in your house it's not your money they don't say you may it's a must when they say you are a raw bite means what it's yours it's not yours and god helping you just apply and my love is paying with the group sometimes you ask yourself hey you think yes mata let us pay to to the net pay you know because gross pay we didn't touch it you are smart the government of this country take his money from the gross so you want to give god from your come on church you must not want someone to teach you these things come on come here come and they say french come here you you can't the government take to the cross you give for the government a lot and you want to give god the lead or less you don't need someone to commit the puppy to tell you you must pay to the cross to the my wife she was already paid the girls before even if they started teaching of pay growth and the night i said ah you you are just in my heart i just marry a right wife for me thank the lord she never she never have any problem so i said that side of money let us go to disparity let's just i'm pulling up because he's my best friend he must he must understand me sometimes when i behave funny you know sometimes spiritual people you behave funny sometimes you don't understand yourself you don't know what you want so she must know when i'm in that confusion is your confusion between the two hero that's why but the branham says sometimes beta can think like i don't love her i don't want to be with her but i love her he just stopped there he doesn't explain but when you're not spiritual you can't understand mother thought that i don't love i love her but that i didn't want to be her with her i want to fish that quotation it didn't explain why it remained there you must have a spiritual to understand what if it was going through a spiritual man sometimes you don't understand that's what i'm with my wife sometimes so i'm trying to train her to understand the spiritual people the spiritual husband she wrote on her book i'll marry a preacher say okay so i always remind her when i'm into her nerves she come back you wrote yourself that you want to marry a preacher i am a preacher i didn't write in your book she wasn't thinking why she told me he regretted you know she didn't tell me there is a good advantage of the preacher and there is also bad advantage so always when i want to be with god i miss you when you want to be with me you like how not i'll be with god you can't change it because i told you between jesus and you mama i will choose jesus hallelujah oh praise the lord clapton for the lord but he's a sweden she's very muslim i love her really i i don't regret to marry my wife i'm honest i took my time i marry her egg early relationship there is a problem whatever you know the character between two families before it's mangled it's always a sparkle until you understand your adjust because only things you can compromise is your character between the families but you can't compromise the world i always tell her the word of god we put there we follow there is no compromising but my character i like a pup you like rice you like fufu i like a chicken we can compromise you cook three times the chicken meals i like fish compromising that's about marriage compromising but the word there is no compromising that's where you succeed because our culture is the word of god clap the hand for them [Applause] i always said i can expose my wife i can expose myself so what about you that's me that's the way i preach i don't anything i don't know that's the way you grow up you know you can't give what you don't have i always say though that you can't give what you've got but abraham said if the pastor is arrogant when he's preaching observe his church people will be arrogant take his spirit to you not the holy spirit so if really i must stand in front of you and i have a wife better biting gossiping she the problem is that she's the one when the sister they want to fight when they want to talk they mentioned my wife babe i didn't say in that way i would just say it hey praise the lord amen amen praise the lord that's that's why i always say father you gave me the ministry help me with my wife because i can't stand in here she's not right i don't think she must be perfect no there is a man many things we can follow the message man of life the life so when you have it you can give it and before when inspiration starts to come i will share with her first i say i say sometimes she's tired the poor girl yo praise the lord she's been in trouble i'm sorry babies i am that's the way i am live there for the lord amen amen that's the message of the hour when you ask our brother and sister how many years they stay there ask them how many things they've been going through until they get old ask them they will tell you they're always quiet they always see sometimes they can see these young preachers something they don't know they just pray for us because us we are preachers but they can help us they can call young people come there is one two three four one ah okay pray for me you know yeah i love correction me i lack correction because that's where i learn no more even if ariel is very young than me but he can't correct me but you'll say okay pray for me my friend you know i pray for me sometimes you look down upon with me even if that's that boy he can when he's talking one day i was at that place i said thank you for your music you only sing for us thank you you know what he answered he said thank you too for listening i never forgot he just clicked this child and he appreciate and he also give back the right no no god help me so i've learned also to him thank you also to listen to me but sometimes us when we are preachers they say hi brother god bless you the same one was good god bless you brother you feel like you preached i didn't preach i'm not a preacher it's him the preacher say also thank you for listening living for the lord also a child teach me something yeah it was him yeah good well thank you also do you remember that day right i was the oh she doesn't even remember he said thank you also for listening what it just came to everything you were either placed the way we're eating talking i forgot everybody downward until today so that's the way you have to teach yourself to be humble anyone can teach you sisters brother kid they can have something for you good you can hold on sometimes we ask them how you know they are very humble they've been going through churches doctrines people they love to church they they know a lot but they don't talk they always visit they pray they go back one day they visit us when they visit us i wasn't if they i wish if i was there and they can gravity questions but i was going to work and they come and see the sister say ah you know sometimes she's the daughter of god you feel like you in heaven so it is it's a connection of the seed you feel the presence of the lord praise god i remember one day i prayed somewhere i don't know where i was just giving you anointing what is this i came hey brother god bless you brother but don't think nothing and god bless you and you go out you know the sister argue i can't even remember you guys me oh okay i don't know so babe the brother said that you have an evil spirit that sister she comes he didn't win what he just come under the anointing he doesn't know what to do confused it means i thought i'll give an example when you are on the stage this is you know when you take a message as a law it's killing people message is not the law the message is a life when the message becomes a law we are we are building the hypocrite sitting on the bench i said and you you are in a good position and the sister she's falling on the stairs because you can't hug the sister you can't hold the hair not to break so you're gonna just come out hey sister i can't hold you bum bum by break his head something wrong something wrong that's why sometimes when you don't understand please keep quiet keep quiet don't talk keep what i've learned to keep quiet when i don't understand let me give you one story it was really disturbing me maybe you have already already because it is all over it's already on youtube one pasta i know bro rather than us those sometimes things prison they don't like we always expose things on the table we pray about it we awake his children and they can pray about it the spirit of god in them will help them to be awake don't because i'm a preacher you can't just give yourself submit you don't know which kind of spirit i have no some a wolf behind the pulpit we are living in the right of matthew 24 24. that's the right time i'm living so be careful children of god that's why i love the lord i don't ask who's sister billy as no even when i met my wife i never even asked brother one how is uh gossein can i tell

and you say praise the lord god is good i didn't read today i'm going to count down it that's right because sometimes you you sleep when you sleep i shake you'll be right and you wake up then i read praise god i love you so much i just love uh you i'm honest i always be happy to be among you people amen i can drive an hour to come i don't feel it i can come morning i go back to my place for a five minutes i came back again for the communion service i don't feel that i drove in two hours it's because i feel good to be among your people there is a children of god sitting here i'm very sure i just god among his people and you are pulling when you are preaching you are pulling when i are forced to stop so you can feel it okay let us let us i think we finished right i didn't really get this okay now let us lay aside lord every toe of the day every care of this life all the way from the janitor to the pastor that there will be nothing in our minds now but beware listening reverently for the holy spirit to speak to us that we might accomplish something good to know more of the by our gathering together for lord truly that's why we come on this hot day speak to us through thy living word and let the living word dwell in us and abide in us that we might be shaped and formed no to the world but be transformed by the renewing of our spirit into the form of the son of god oh our heart tremble when we think and the joyful our souls to know that we can be called the sons and the daughter of god we stand on the very brim of his second coming and whole nations and the kingdom quivering under our faith all things of the world is vanishing but knowing that someday he shall come and they shall take us to a kingdom where they shall never be a hang oh it will never be moved to think that we are now the subject of the kingdom of god circumcised our heart our and the ears today by the holy spirit through the washing of the the the word of the world for we ask it in the name and for his glory amen clap the hand for them that's what we need we need god to help us we need god to help us to wash us through the word to the water of the world is only god can do that there is no one can do that there is no one can prepare us for the kingdom of god you what i ask you this morning you just be that positive don't let the devil preach to you and take it always be positive you know that what you want to be you will be if you want and the norris job what he didn't want to happen to him he was afraid of it happened to him he was thinking too much about that one i don't wanna they wrong come to my children he sacrificed i don't wanna they don't come to me sacrifice i don't so that word was he was thinking over and over it will be materialized until it reached the curtain of time to cross it to reach god amen and wanted to reach god and the gods and talk to the devil do you notice my servant because his thought crossed the curtain of the life it reached at the holy place because that thought was materialized one day i'll come and teach you how you thought can it be materialized it can be a christian oh no that's why babylon said you must be always positive don't fear nothing when you fear that you fear when you think over and over it comes because you are so it becomes solid it crosses do you know that this solid things it becomes from unseen do you know that yourself but the problem said they can break you break you you come to invisible do you know that the invisible is more powerful for what is visible so they feel invisible it can materialize and i can assure you you can chris be christian or not it can be materialized because though are the principle of god so uf you must be always positive when the devil bring it don't call your children stupid you are not intelligent you are don't do that everyday not intelligent school tell them you are the prince you are intelligent don't call yourself you are poor you are rich that's why it says those are poor they must confess they are rich you are sick you confess you are healed your confession will come to pass and the how is coming is another teaching it can take i don't know one day i will count that teaching it will help you and you'll like it so be positive this morning i'm encouraging you to be always positive put aside the negative thought because what you fear for that's the what you are thinking more and what is going to happen and you know job after he crossed that trial he never feared anymore he never he was just plain oh my redeemer leave it i can fall down again he's gonna pick me up nothing no fear because that thought let go and he thought god knows everything he's just plain why because don't always think negative about yourself you are the son of god you are a daughter of god at work there are challenges so learn to forgive is you practice learn to say thank you is a practice start by small things when you have to change start by your bedroom you always wake up you leave your bedroom without fixing it start fixing first your bedroom that's a change stand for small things you'll go to the big thing he's exercising and when you exercise that's what sometimes uh my wife used to call me as my wife my husband now he stopped she stopped she understand me and she was calling me my husband is very ambitious that one now he understood that he's not ambitious yesterday was telling me say hey babe you have faith that's the first time she told me that since i married her i'm telling you so she realizes she's observing me she realized no no it's not ambition this is the faith and the most of the time i can say something she doesn't want to do it we don't fight and you know what they are very proud because we don't beat them we don't beat sisters because everybody takes like i beat myself i can't beat her and she can be no no i know i know i still loving you praise the lord and you know what god is going to do she's going to do what she wants to do and it will fail she came to me i told you babe let us do this you know what sometimes god can allow even if a wrong thought of your husband to happen you remember that sister she went to brahma i don't want to go to their church i'm a christian they are not christian you know i refuse bless sister when she he asked you to go to their church or to the party or whatever go be submit first when you submit you engage the law of reaction hallelujah you don't know submit first go with him even to the party but don't act like them don't drink don't dance and tell him i'm going because i'm your husband but no i'm not going to dance for the divorce i know baby just be there for me because you submit and when you do that you allow the word of god to work on him when you refuse you bring pride and he gonna say what your church is teaching you to be disobedient exactly church the word is sinful you just apply what is killing us is a pride sometimes as preachers we are so proud and we don't know i was praying for god to notice that i was also proud i didn't know until god revealed to me so if god revealed to me how many preachers also they are they didn't yet have that revelation we are so proud and when they are talking sometimes you can see it you are wrong you want to generate to put that general that that wrong is become for everybody no if something happened humble yourself as forgiveness even if you are not wrong forgive me that god knows my heart i was going to tell a story but be spiritual to understand it someday know it some they don't know it one pastor was praying he said he was praying to the mountain he prayed and after he finished they call him to the phone they said there is one person was killed here can you come and look at it and they call him with the the the cell phone the number of the sister and the pastor went he drove he went to the place that's the pasta version he said so when he reached the place he panicked he found the sister was killed and i said when he panicked and he he took the the shoes and the bag you want to put there and they realize that i can't do this because they can say i kill him i kill her and they want to go when he wants to go the police they follow him and something le pen and until he didn't stop and they arrest him they put him to jail they said echo the system now the police said this is vice versa it sometimes they can trap him sometimes he did it until today we don't know what happened but i gave you that story for you because sometimes things can happen in your life and what you can hear there the position you must take when you hear those things you hear you keep quiet you pray right that's that's what i'm telling you of this story there is a many story up there but this one is really disturbing me that's why i share with you i call you brother brother by the way say but joseph let's just pray that's why he answered and he told me i was this really disturbed so sometimes why god allow a servant of god to be in that such trap i don't know he did it i don't know why that happened we don't know the the police said this we saw egypt in jerusalem they called jeep all these 4x4 they call them cheap all these uh 4x4 toyota jeep whatever all these big 4x4 they call them jeepers we saw a jeep it come in that bush it through a dead body and that jeep come out we start to follow the jeep that car he didn't stop we follow we follow we follow until he didn't want to stop we stop him we stop him until it was the cow is was a lot a lot those cars and he stopped and we arrest him we put and behind we say that's the first suspect when i was say it a bit meet yourself i don't know you it's not the story because the story it's very complicated i don't know what happened god knows but where i was i was disturbed it is when they questioned the pastor it didn't mention the sister they said i'm sorry this is a mixed congregation they said even if this clothing of inside was in the pasta bag he said no no no no it was not in my bag it was in the back of this girl that's my problem it's not about the story we don't know what happened so when there is a problem she's not a sister anymore she becomes this girl and when as preachers we are relating that story we don't feel sorry for the sister who's dead we are feeling sorry for the pasta is exposed my second or my second concern it means they saw their pasta is more than they saw with that sister is dead that's where my problem is that's where i was traveling i said god that helped me to to to to suppress because i can't take it this normal because those reaction it's your hatred like she's my sister i don't know let me just give you an example from sister bill you fantastic whatever they said i killed her the way i love sister billa i can't even see how they arrest me how prison i'm going to i'll be just crying first my sister what's happened to my sister b work here sister bill you don't understand what i'm saying it's not about prison it's not about what but your body language can show which kind of christian you are your body language it can show which kind of person you want they give another question be humble pastor you are already in the problem proud he's answering you know this problem happened you know it's uh it touched all pastors in the world preachers it didn't touch me because there is a wolf behind the puppet we know it there is which is sitting on the bench they are fighting the message they can sit here and they'll be there to go to hell we know it but abraham said there is a three kind of believer in any church we know it but we are preaching to the believer we don't care about them i mean i want them to be there to fight and i want to beat them like they're lucky they can't play with me i know why i'm staying glory be to god yes sir we don't fear which is we don't feel wizard why they must be they must fight they must see how power we are oh that sister she's a witch you start to run away from a coward just going she must run away from you you have a power you don't know how valued you are witches which what is the witches let them be there you know you don't know what they are playing for your mind you feel your tour like in africa hey there the witch is dead today they're crossing the roof we didn't sleep because you put in your mind which is they are there i was telling one day my wife sometimes our heater is can make noise in the house [Music] this is it's oh sometimes you can see you can hear like someone is walking noises whatever i told her i said i said baby do you say yeah something i explained this i'm the one i always sleep home i can be a i can be alone noise i just smile ah it's nice that's noise and i sleep now if you put in your mind maybe someone can oh yo yo yo the devil gonna come and preach to you yes you don't know before you enter you don't know how many people they die in this house remember that story the mother was cooking in the kitchen midnight spirit the devil will pull up those story and when fear comes you gone when the fear comes you finish that's how i say brother if you marry a witch there is no scripture you to divorce her hey you will stay with her until that's why brother hear you you must pray come on come on hallelujah please that's why sister you must pray you know there is no scripture to say he said which you no no no you're gonna stay for your witch is going to be with you every day there's no scripture so we can't help you so be serious yourself and be ready to get married you not to be ready to get married is what you reach a level way you remove your design in your brain you don't understand what i'm saying i love him always you know you remove your design you reach a level way even if she got one leg that's the level way god step in brother when you used to have your design you will wait like me i took time but it's okay i'm fine i don't want you to take time like me i want you to get married daily i'm praying god give a wonderful wonderful sister for this wonderful brother she's good that sister must cook nice for her she must have the holy spirit i'm always prayerful you also help us you know to help us is remove your design remove though she can be i don't know how but god must be in do you know that you can marry a beautiful woman before you marry her she's too beautiful but when she enter in your house she's a witch you can't see anymore that beauty i saw in my country people struggling with witch sisters they are which we know but we can't do nothing they are there struggling brother we pray for you if he is going to kill you you die there is no scripture so you must be very serious and to let go to be in your state i reached that level brother i was someone who oh when you talk to the sister if i'm interested i want to talk to you when he said i'm right i'm not interested okay you know i'm a preacher i'm i can go around and sometimes you know we like you feel like you're someone you know but when the that time you reach you feel you are nothing when does that say no i'm not interested ah i can't go a second time ah sister plenty when i reached that time i said god i don't know where she is father i just want to get married i wear she's if she's and i used to say most of the time if she's unarrested she must come maybe i can go and i don't know and i start traveling when i travel to zimbabwe i preach that i feel like she's around i talk to pastor jesus i don't know i always feel nizim i was thinking like i was
