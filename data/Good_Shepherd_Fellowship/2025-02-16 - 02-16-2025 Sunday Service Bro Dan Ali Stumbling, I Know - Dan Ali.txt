midst a brother and a sister brother Matthew and uh sister is it chish praise the Lord okay God bless you God bless you for coming okay um just a reminder that our special meetings with Brother Joseph chosi um is taking place Saturday March 8th at 6: p.m. and then Sunday at our usual time uh plan to be part of it praise the Lord uh brother Lawrence are you behind there I think I will leave you for now because the musicians are gone praise the Lord um there was a music we sang on Wednesday night I have heard that music over and over but on Wednesday night it came to me very much in a different way it pierced through my soul and it's just been on my heart all through and Wednesday Wednesday night I enjoyed the service so much so much so that on our way home before then on Monday when I was going to work I left home very early in the morning and at about 4 probably 420 4:30 I was on the highway and getting to Dayton I saw a police light initially I didn't know it was the police car before then I had seen two cars trucks already putting salt on the road because it was very slippery so when I saw the third light a part of me said it was another salt truck and as I got closer I realized no it wasn't a salt truck but it was a police car that had pulled over a semi the semi was close to the wall and the the the police car was right in the in the lane and I was coming so I hit my break but I was very careful because it was very slippery I didn't want want to run into the police car and in the Middle Lane there were two cars trucks that were coming and they wouldn't change their lanes and I was surprised I signaled and they saw the danger ahead but they wouldn't change their lenses so I was coming I got so close to the police car I didn't want to hit it now it was just about probably 60 50 m per hour so now I was alone there was nobody in the passenger seat I wanted to avoid the police car so when the first truck passed I don't know how I managed to avoid the police car and then got in between the two cars I have no idea what happened but then as soon as I passed I heard boom I said what happened in the truck I didn't know what went on so I went to work then my manager came because he also lives in St Michael then he said Dan how was the commute I said it was good it was just so slippery and traffic was slow and he said it took me 1 hour 45 minutes to drive in I said what he said yeah there is an accident I said accident he said yes I dated I said oh I heard the sound but I didn't see it I said I was going to be in the news he said a car just ran into a police car I said oh that was the police car I avoided so it looked like the car behind me just ran into it and then he said something he said there was somebody watching over you praise the Lord now you know it is something when a brother or a sister is telling you something like this but then is something completely different when it is coming from an unexpected Source I didn't expect it then I just said amen praise the Lord now on Wednesday as I said I enjoyed that song we didn't sing it all through and it's been on my heart so much but the one took over the pulpit and it was a wonderful time of fellowship and I went and Dr my wife with the boys on our way on the highway we just went all through as soon as I left the highway and I was taking the ramp to 240 241 then I heard my tire flapping then I said woof I have a flat ti so I put my hazard light on and I drove right to the gas station and I packed there now all along I knew that my right rear tire was low on air so when that happened my guess was oh it was the real tire so I pked the car I told the boys I called my wife I said get us an Uber praise the Lord at least the first time I got to enjoy Uber I didn't know how it felt so she got us Uber I went in I told the guys I said oh can I leave my truck here I have a problem I said no that is no problem so I went home the following day I called in I told my boss I had a problem with my tire I'm not coming in so brother one arranged for a AAA car to come so I went there I looked behind the car the ti was okay I said so what happened yesterday then I went on the other side and I saw that the tire the front the passenger side the front tire the tire was off the rim I said oh so this was what happened I have never seen that before I said wow so then I just started you know making fun with myself I said wow it looked like when I was on the highway the devil got so crazy or so mad with the service that on my way he just came and he wanted to push me into the G and God said no you can't do it here of because I was asking myself at 80 M hour if this should happen what is going to be the result and I hear God say no wait until it is 30 m hour then you can do it and wait also till he he has a place to packk and I know the devil was very mad and I just got there I was so blown away and you know then what my manager said it was just a reminder that there is somebody watching over you and me if God should open our eyes to see the things that go on around us we will be forever grateful sometimes we complain about unnecessary things we comp complain about worldly things we look at the people in the world and the things they are enjoying and we look at ourselves and we look mean on ourselves and they are nothing it's just it it just reminds me of the two fishes that went to God to pray and one fish said open my eyes I want to see all my enemies so I can deal with with them boot to boot an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth God said good you got it and the the other fish came and said for me I don't want to know who my enemies are the ble is the Lord's ble it is not mine vengeance is unto the Lord just keep me away from my enemies just guide me just protect me just deliver me be my shield and God said you got it the fish that said open my eyes to see my enemies that fish died in seven days why because when it went he saw a hook waiting for it and then when it ran away he saw the Fisherman's Net waiting for it it ran away when he went it way he saw a shark coming it ran away it it was running away from one danger to the other till it had no time to eat and it died but the fish that said just guide me protect me deliver me I'm in your hands let your will be done praise be to God that fish will just swim swim swim and then see a hook it doesn't even know it is a hook and then there is a bait on it it comes it picks the bit oh so there was a hook here praise the Lord and then it goes and then it gets somewhere and then it real it is trapped oh what is this it looks like a net it will shake itself and then off it's gone oh praise the Lord and it will swim and swim and swim and swim and it doesn't even know it has entered the shar's mouth and it is there it is food but the Shar cannot digest it praise the Lord and then it just comes swims out he said oh so for all this time I was in the mouth of the shark oh praise the Lord you know we we oh my goodness the Lord is so faithful the Lord our God is so good his eyes are upon every one of us our steps are ordered of him there is nothing that can go on wrong with your life if something wrong happens just pray it just happens that a lot of the times we don't pray until there is danger it's sad it doesn't have to be so you have to cultivate that relationship with God have a relationship with God it should be easy for you to go on your knees or sit in your car or lie on the bed and just have that time with God praise the Lord but we wait till there is danger We Wait Till There is sickness we wait till things go wrong that is why we begin to cry out to God and guess what if that is what you are waiting on to have a relationship with God God will give it to you if you want to wait till there is danger before you get down with you get down to business with God if God wants to have fellowship with you and he looks in there and he sees that no you are waiting for danger before you pray he will allow it why do we have to wait till things go wrong why do we have to wait praise the Lord have that relationship with God by the grace of God this morning we are going to talk about something praise the Lord before then shall we just stand for Theon of the world I'm reading from Romans Romans 835 Romans 8 Romans 83 okay Romans 8:35 I read who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all this we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor dep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word shall we be seated praise the Lord as we have read nothing nothing can take us away from the love of God no famine no hunger no danger no joblessness no sickness nothing can take us away from the love of God God has instilled his love in our house when God puts just a little bit of his love in you to love him it doesn't matter what you go through it doesn't matter what you go through when you have that burning desire in you to serve God there isn't enough of this world there isn't enough that this world can offer you because all your heart desire is just to please the Lord all your heart desire is just to serve God the best you know nothing else matters yes you work you go to school you make the money you do businesses whatever God put whatever you want to do you will do it but there is one thing there is one thing that brings you Joy you would realize it doesn't matter how much you are blessed in the of this life it doesn't give you Joy it just gives you that temporary relief it doesn't bring you Joy the only thing that satisfy your soul is nothing but the word and if there is something that satisfies your soul other than your the word of God you need to pray if there is something else in this life that can give you Joy in your soul other than the word of God you are in for trouble praise the Lord it will be better to have the word and lose everything leave a proper all your life nobody has to know you but you have a place with God tomorrow by the grace of God today we are going to talk about stumbling I know stumbling I know it sounds weird right praise the Lord one day at work I was going to set up some equipment for a r the following day now this area I have a radio station it's not mine but I have set it to 60 what is it again can you tell me the radio station 96.3 that's correct God bless you so I have studed to 96.3 from that time I found that radio station I have not gone back to KT as a matter of fact I don't even know whether they still exist and I went in there and there was this music playing I don't know the title of the song but there was just a line that said stumbling I know but I'm coming and when I heard that song something just took my heart that I went and I sat down and I listened to the song in less than two minutes the song was over and I just I was just so grafted to my seat I sat there for a while probably for 30 minutes just I just didn't know what I was doing but it blessed my soul so much and how I wished that it was a cassette and I press reply rly reply till my soul couldn't take it anymore and then this morning we are going to talk about stumbling I know now stumbling I know looks very much like a present condition a present condition I am stumbling I know for some of us yes stumbling I know for some of us also maybe it is not going to be stumbling I know but it could be stumbled I know where the devil is seeking to carry to your past and pin you down under the weight of your sins and your iniquities in the past but whether it is stumbling I know or stumbled I know it makes no difference praise the Lord not stumbling I think not stumbling I feel not stumbling my pastor says not stumbling my husband says not stumbling my wife says not stumbling my brother or my sister says but stumbling I know there is no uncertainty about it when you look at yourself in the mirror of God's word don't sugarcoat sin call out what you see by name if it is a spade it's a spade not a big spoon with a wooden handle praise the Lord Call It by name when you are dealing with God you know that God sees you I mean deep down there he knows you more than you know yourself so what are you hiding from God when a man begins to hide something from God it shows that they don't even know the God your servant as I said one time ago it's like playing with a child and they run under a blanket you are looking at them running under the blanket and then they go under it and their legs are outside and they say they are hiding that is what we do sometimes when we come in the presence of God let it out let it out it shows that you are ready you you show that you are ready but when you begin to sugarcoat things begin to use grammar trying to redefine things it shows you are not ready yet and if you are not ready yet in the day and time we are living in when again are you going to get ready we are closer to today than we were yesterday and by the time we leave service today we will be closer then than we were coming in if there was any time to mean business with God it is now if you can't mean business with God now when when time is no more if anybody tells you there is time and enjoy yourself there is time take it easy till you grow there is time you are young there is time there is no time don't let anybody deceive you today could be the last day today could be the last day nobody knows it it's in the hands of God make your calling and election sure don't settle for anything nothing but the word let the word be your anchor praise be to God that was the song The Anchor Holds yes that was a song Let the word be your anchor let the word be your strength let the word be your absolute let the word be everything to you don't settle for anything less what is it that we have seen that has come to stay forever Heaven and Earth shall pass away the only thing that would not pass away is the word and when this word is in you you are blessed you are blessed praise be to God as I said we are going to talk about stumbling I know for you it could be stumbled I know but I'm coming stumbling I know praise the Lord when a man gets to a point or when a woman gets to a point that the devil cannot convince them to do anything sometimes we baffle the devil the devil looks at us and he doesn't understand the sort of who he's dealing with because the devil tells you that God does not love you and you say even if he does not love me I am coming anyhow that you are not a child of God because he did that that that that he will list everything he said praise be to God stumbled I know but I'm coming anyhow the devil will tell you that this sin is so huge God cannot forgive this sin there is no sin that God cannot forgive there is no sin that is too big that God cannot forgive if you decide to hold on to it and you tell yourself that this is too big God cannot forgive yes you are going to hold to it and it's going to be big to you and God will not forgive that sin why because you have limited the power of the blood and it is a sin to limit God it is a sin to limit God for you a man to tell yourself what God can do and what God cannot do just take God at his word it may not mean anything to you you may not understand it you don't have to understand everything no you can write on one single scripture to Heaven you don't have to know from the one cover to the other from the from you don't have to know everything you don't have to also understand everything that is why we serve God by faith stumbling I know in 2016 in the Olympic Games in Rio Deo there was an American by name Abby abitino and there was also somebody from New Zealand Nikki hbling there was a 5,000 m race and then they started the race and halfway the race Nikki fell down and iy just came stumbled over her and also fell all the other r that came just skipped over them just jumped over them and off they went but when I be got up on her feet initially did she didn't know how much she was hurt she went to the rescue of Nikki and lifted her up and then let's go and as they started to run she saw that she couldn't she stood on her feet she tried to balance herself and then she fell right back to the ground and hbling lifted her up first it was Niki who lifted her up this time hbling is lifting her up praise the Lord and I could just see the new the the New Zealander telling the American girl you know um I can't go any further I am so hurt and actually she was so hurt she had a t ACL and a t Minar and we are talking of h a 5,000 m race that was just halfway through a very good place to have given an excuse just lie down and they'll come with a stretcher and come and take you off the field and carry to the hospital but that was not enough she started running just hopping on her feet just limping they stumbling stumbling stumbling I know but here I come just tumbling and she run all the rest of the race with so much pain you could see it in her face nashing her teeth and everybody just left them they were the two people that came in last and there you would realize that every race is not just about winning it's not about being coming first it's not about being the best because all eyes were on the two of them that were coming in last it is contrary to the game a lot of the times people are looking at the people ahead the first second and third positions and they are applauding you but this time the people gave them a standing ovation and they were standing applauding them why because the two of them were so h and yet they wouldn't give up they were just coming it was not about their person because they realized that they were representing their different countries they realized that they were they had the flag of their countries before them and that the race was bigger than them and they gave him all their best and when they finished oh they just came and they hug each other with the tears running down later the international Olympic Committee awarded them one of the highest award that they would ever give and that was the pure the pure the one of the awards a very very high award they awarded two of them which they really do p detin yes P detin award was given to them and those that went ahead of them more than half of them never got any award they never got any recognition and that show of sportsmanship was D as the greatest moment in that sporting history display of sportsmanship display of sportsmanship now I want us to realize that a race has been set before you and me we are also running a race we are running a race a race has been set before us even though we are running a race we are not in a competition in every other athletic event they are in a competition I want to be first so when you fall down I will skip over you make sure I cross the finishing line but the race you and I are running we are not in a competition in this race when your brother falls down or your sister falls down you don't skip over them you don't jump over them you don't leave them behind so you can go ahead of them and be the first so you can go and cross the finish line no we are in a race where we lift one another up that when somebody's down you lift him up when somebody's down you lift her up that we are there for one another there is a race that has been said before Us Praise the Lord and I'll be taking a some few scriptures here as we go along praise the Lord I want us to read from Romans Romans 14 so remember that this race is not about giving up this race is not about giving up and the good thing is that if you ever want to find an excuse why you should not serve God the devil will give you a lot a lot more than you ever expected you want an excuse why you shouldn't come to church the devil the devil give you a dozen you want an excuse why you should not be faithful the devil give you a dozen you want an excuse why you should go back to the world and do things of the world the devil will give you more than 100 but where you are determined where you are determined there is no excuse that can take you out of the will of God you will not settle for anything that is a man or a woman that is resilient praise the Lord Romans 14 24 what did I say Romans 14 Romans 14 oh I got the wrong scripture okay um Paul said we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak so that was the scripture I was looking for so um just forget of the the quotation I gave you but we then we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak First Corinthians 9:119 First Corinthians 9:19 for though I be free from all men ye have I made made myself servant unto that I might gain the more and unto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law to them that are under the law that I might gain them that are under the law to them that are without without the law as without law being not without law to God but under the law of Christ that I might game them that are without law to the weak I became as weak that I might gain the weak I am made all things to all men excuse me that I might by all means save some praise the Lord so when you look at this scripture you see that Paul is doing everything possible everything possible he will just come down to a man's level to make sure that he's able to lift that man up with all that Paul had with everything that he knew he didn't consider himself better than anybody he didn't consider himself a special person under every circumstance he looks at the situation what can I do to be of a help to them that are without the law to them that without the law to them that are weak he would make sure that he is coming down to your level praise be to God stumbling I know Romans 78 Romans 7:18 it looks I'll be doing a lot of reading today it's probably the maybe the second to last not too much reading Romans 7 718 18 to 21 okay for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I will do good evil is present with me praise the the Lord so when you look at what Paul is saying here it's just like brother brother talking about that Indian brother that when he asked that brother how things are going the brother said pretty good and pretty bad pretty good and pretty bad and then he went on to say that there is a constant fight between the white dog and a black dog because the white dog wants me to do good but the black dog wants me to do bad evil but the one I feed the most is the one that overcomes so in me do I left no good thing Paul is saying the good that I would I do not but the evil that I would not that I do that constantly constantly you are faced with a choice either to do good or evil is before you and somehow every single single day we are stumbling every single day we are stumbling it's say oh no brother I don't stumble every day sometimes when we talk of stumbling people think of the the big big big big evil things by your thoughts by what you think the thoughts that run to your mind if you are sincere with yourself yourself you would realize that you have stumbled by the things you say before you realize you have said things you shouldn't say sometimes you go down memory lane we were not all born Christians God delivered us along the way and has made us who we are by Grace but sometimes our human nature just go down that memory lane and then you go and then you go inside the garbage can your spirit will go just looking through the garbage can looking for what God has delivered you and we bring things back to inflict ourselves to defile ourselves by our reasoning we stumble and do we say because I have stumbled let me just keep stumbling that is what the devil does if the devil can bring you to a place to do something you know is against the will of God oh the devil is good at what he does we have a good adversary even when he know he's defeated he doesn't give up when he knows that he's going to be defeated he will still come he doesn't take no for an answer he keeps trying his luck he has never stopped to try praise the lord we have a good adversary he never stops and you don't ever have to stop praise the Lord if the devil can get you to do one thing wrong he just comes behind it and and then he builds over it oh you have already done it you you did it already so it doesn't matter whether you do it again or not you have messed up so keep doing it and a lot of the times people will settle for it and they will just keep going and make sure they mess up and they mess up well when you realize you have messed up get back on your feet when you realize you are ching A cause that is ungodly make sure you get BR into Fellowship when you realize that what you are doing is against the will of God there is still Blood on the seat The Mercy Seat of God that will one day become a judgment seat God is still working on our lives God is still forgiven sins when you realize you have fallen you have have stumbled just get back and keep marching on don't settle for anything the devil tells you get back into Fellowship put your life back on track don't just take it and say it's okay let me just keep doing it because I'm already in it no it shows the seed that is in you if you have a little bit of God in you just a little bit of God in you a little thirst and a little hunger of God in you you will never be comfortable living a sinful life you will never be comfortable others do it and they are fine they okay is just part of who they are is their life life but you do it you have sleepless nights the devil will torment you and torment you and torment you you will never believe what you got yourself this is where we ought to be there knowing that in this race we are called to it's not me versus you no it's not me versus you we are all in it together I should be able to provide your support and vice versa we are not giving up we don't give up on one another we are not giving up the goal is to cross the Finishing Line together that is the goal it doesn't matter who goes first and who comes last the goal is to make sure that you are crossing the finishing line that life is not about you that when you leave the blood stain by of Christ that you are looking at the Finishing Line it's not to get halfway the journey and then throw in the towel no we are crossing the Finishing Line we are not going to s for anything less keep pressing on keep pressing on the highway praise the Lord Psalm 103 Psalm 103 PM 1038 the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in Mercy he will not always child neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities oh the Lord is good for the wages of sin is death that is what we deserve that is what every man deserve who was not born a sinner the wages of sin is death but God has not rewarded us according to what we deserve he is so gracious he is plenteous in Mercy the Bible says he will not CH he will not keep his anger forever just like a father picture of his son I think praise the Lord verse 11 for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy towards them that fear Him 12 as far as the East is from the West so far have he removed our transgression our transgressions from us like as a father pth his children saw the Lord pity of them that fear Him Praise the Lord for he knoweth our frame he remember that we are dust as for men his days are as grass as a flow of the field so he flourisheth for the wind passeth over and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear fear him and his righteousness unto children's children to such as keep his Covenant and those to those that remember his covenants to do them praise the Lord what a gracious God we are serving his mercies are from Everlasting to Everlasting he would not keep his anger forever he remembers that we are human beings he knows what we are capable of he knows what we can do he know our limitations and the Lord has not appropriated to us according to what we need no if God should reward us accordingly none of us will be in this room we are seated here purely by Grace purely by Grace God may have taken me from a dumb site in Africa and he may have taken you from another D site somewhere in Asia or here in America but the F remains that we are all here by the grace of God God has delivered us from one thing or the other praise be to God he is such a merciful god that you know the Bible says his word would not go out and return unto him void the the word of God doesn't just come just for the sake of it all we are doing this morning may just be for one person it may just be for one person praise the Lord and we all have to rejoice in it because the Bible has made it clear that when one soul is redeemed or repent that there is joy in heaven and whatever brings Joy To God In Heaven Must Be must be joyful to us it is something we should also rejoice in Praise the Lord it may be for one person nobody knows but if your life is not right with God if you are doing something that is contrary if you have fallen if you have stumbled it doesn't matter how many times you have stumbled the just shall fall seven times and rise again it doesn't matter how many times you have stumbled it doesn't matter how many times you have fallen it doesn't matter how you were injured just get back on your feet you don't have to run at a 100 miles per hour if it is just one step at a time that is all God expects of you just keep moving on keep marching forward stumbling I know but here I come stumbling I know but I'm not giving up stumbling I know but I know the Lord my God is through stumbling I know I know my God is faithful stumbling I know God is merciful and his mercies are from Everlasting to Everlasting praise God be to God do not let your weakness come in the way when the devil points you to your weakness Point him to the blood praise the Lord stumbling I know but I'm coming I'm not going to stop I'm not going back into the world I'm never going to give up I'm not throwing in the tower stumbling I know but I'm coming stumbled I know but I'll will not be pinned down by my past praise be to God the Lord our God is the same yesterday today and forever God is still changing lives God is still transforming Lives why do we come to church of course we come to praise the Lord and to hear from God and God Alone knows what you are going through and what you are dealing with I don't know I don't know as a matter of fact when brother one told me to get ready I went somewhere there was something that was so much on my heart and then I realized that no I came back here no I went somewhere I was just all over the place so even deciding what to talk about about I don't know I can only trust that whatever I pick is the will of God and that God through it is going to speak to somebody praise the Lord I have no way of knowing which way God is going to move I have no way I can't tell praise the Lord stumbling I know that I'm coming the devil can give you all the excuses in the world when he gets to realize that you are not settling down for any of them you baffle him you baffle him we say the Devil is a warrior we say um he his um a while ago what did I say he said it's a good adversary but the devil was to say what I have not seen any adversary like this brother I have not seen any adversary like this sister it is not you when the word has taken a hold of your house it is no longer about you praise the Lord I think we are doing very good with time praise the Lord stumbling I know the prodal son when the Lord Jesus Christ talked about that story about a rich man who son came to his father and asked for his share of The Inheritance normally your father would die or your parents will die before we talk about inheritance but here he comes in fact it just tells you about human nature that human beings can be very very bad without the love of God in the heart of a man that man can be very very bad that some of the this rich people thank God some of us are not rich that their children probably pray for their parents to die quick so that can inherit the wealth yes it's true so poverty sometimes is a disguise blessing praise the Lord because they know you don't have anything if you die today they have nothing to inherit maybe do not even have money to perform the funeral so they pray that you live long that is a blessing so if you have things to make right in your life you have a little time to make things right praise the lord it's true because I have a friend at work a very very nice person a nice guy if I mention his name brother Johnny will know him he told me his mother went on retirement and then the mother was in the nursing home and drawing from her her pension and guess what some of his siblings got angry that his mother was spending too much can you imagine he said but it's mommy's money he said no but she's spending too much by the time she dies she would have finished everything and he said and so so can you imagine they were praying that she would die quick so they will inherit the money the rest of the morning it's sad it's sad but before she died she willed all her money to the Catholic Church $250,000 so poverty can be a disg blessing I know we don't like we don't want to hear that praise the Lord God send it far away and this boy got his wealth and he went and blew it and after he had wasted everything he found himself sleeping with pigs and eating pig food and he couldn't stand it anymore he said no I am tired living this type of life I am tired living in I am tired I will just go back to my father's house I am not worthy to be taken back as as as as as a hair of the throne but I'll be Satisfied if my father would just take me in as a servant that would be enough and it is not easy I believe with all my heart that in this story that even though we have not read it but when he got up and he was on his way to his father's house the devil may have have told him on the way that you don't let your father see you because he will kill you you were a dishonorable son and he said no stumbled I know but I'm going anyhow the devil told him your father would never accept you even as a servant your father would never be proud of you he said yes you may be telling me the truth stumbled I know but I'm going anyhow it doesn't matter what the devil told him he still went ahead anyhow and to his surprise when he got to the hous Kate the father was there already waiting praise the Lord that before he ever decided to go back there was a father waiting to receive him praise the Lord I don't know how many times the father came at the outskates and looked in that direction and probably said to himself he went this way and I believe by the grace of God one day he is going to come back this way praise the Lord stumbling I know we can talk about that that Pharisee Simon the Pharisee who invited the Lord Jesus Christ to sit with him at meat and the Lord came and he did not welcome him in those days it was just the norm that when a man comes because you walk a long distance by the time you come your feet is dirty you are sweating as a sign of that that they have welcomed you they wash your feet you know anoint your feet you know give you a keiss anoint you with oil but when he came and sat down nobody minded him he was just sitting down they just invited him to mock at him they invited him to make fun of him and he knew it he knew it and I have always asked myself that if they invited him to make fun of him and he knew about it and he went if you are inviting him for a good cause do you think he will come or not do you think he will come on out praise the Lord like a story I Once Upon a Time shared here about a sister who just uh prepared food and he prayed and he said father I have heard about you I have given my life to you I love you I have read about you but you know I have never seen you I have prepared food I want you to come so we eat together she prepared the food set the table and was waiting and was waiting she was in the room and then she heard a knock and when she came and opened the door there was was somebody in front of the door you know human beings she just eyeballed him from head to toe and he didn't look like no this person looks like he's not in his right mind see how he's dressed and the fellow asked for water and then she went in and she took took a cup a cup that she wouldn't give to normal strangers a cup that she probably had not drunk from for years that was sitting Loosely somewhere she took that cup and Saed the man with water then the man left she sat and sat and sat and sat then it was night she prayed said father I prepared the table you didn't show up then she went to B and then she had a dream that the Lord appeared to her in the dream you invited me I came but you didn't receive me when you invite God he comes when you call him he shows up praise the Lord the Lord is so good the Lord is so good you don't have to see him face to face the way I'm looking at you but when you call him he shows up and sometimes to let you know that he's around he will just do something and when you see it oh this is not normal no it must be the Lord just to announce his presence that the Lord is with you how did I get here yes so talking about samon the Pharisee and the Lord was sitting down never attended to him and then this woman we have all read about so that there was an opportunity here and the Bible says she went and bought a very costly ointment very very expensive very special and what that woman did I don't think it was easy this is the Lord Jesus Christ we are talking about who would desend men's heart tell you of things to happen things that are going to be and I believe when she went for the money and she took that money she said to herself oh this man will know how I came by this morning that this money is not even clean this money is filthy and I'm going to use this for anointment for a holy one for the Lord himself but there was something that was driving him she couldn't help it probably one time bought this um um ointment and then went to Simon's place and then when she got to the gate it wasn't an easy task because she probably had looked it was a public place it was not d in secret she probably looked in the Gathering and probably saw some of her clients sitting there and looking at her and they were wondering what is this woman here for and the Lord was sitting down and as she was coming yes I know my life is not right I know I have stumbled I know I have messed up I know I am just a bundle of mess oh this is the Holy One what do I do it's in my heart to go and anoint his feet would he even accept it would he accept me with my Filthy Hands with my useless life with my hopeless life with all the rotness and the filth there is in me would he accept this offer and as he just took a step just step by step just yes stumbled I know but here I come and the people probably looking at her what is this woman doing what is this woman doing and then she went as we all know the story held her his feet and God just opened the fountain in her eyes and then she washed his feet washed his feet wiped his feet with his hair and anointed his feet stumbled I know stumbled I know praise be to God but I'm coming anyhow do not let your sins hold you back do not let your iniquities hold you back the mystery of iniquity iniquity is something you know it's right to do and you fail to do it and something you know is wrong and you do it this is wrong you do it this is right you don't do it the good that I would that I do not but the evil that I would not that I do so knowing the right thing and not even doing it puts you in trouble it puts you in hswing stumbling I know stumbled I know praise the Lord once a child of God always a child of God and remember that when a child of God Falls he doesn't become a child of the devil no it's a child of God that has fallen when a child of God Falls or when a sheep dies he doesn't turn into a goat if God has saved you he saved you he has not saved you to lose you and when things go wrong in your life just make them right and get back on course and keep moving on keep marching on praise the Lord stumbled I know but here I come it doesn't matter how low I sink I am not going to settle for anything but the word I am going to take something here 1954 uh 54221 at Thy Word with all the unity among you people you should never let this drop you should just keep going just keep moving on don't get tired if you feel a little slack just keep moving on anyhow just go right on anyhow believe it just keep moving right on believing God and now I am sure God will bless you don't listen to what the flesh tells you the flesh would always complain and if you want to listen to the complaints of the flesh you are never going to do the will of God the flesh would always want to weigh you down keep moving on keep your focus on the goal the goal is crossing the Finishing Line we owe it to ourselves to cross that Finishing Line it doesn't matter whether we cross that Finishing Line on our toes or on our heels it doesn't matter whether we cross that Finishing Line on our knees it doesn't matter whether we cross that Finishing Line rolling on our back we owe it to ourselves to cross that Finishing Line there is a line we must cross praise the Lord keep moving on don't get tired don't get tired praise the Lord 651 1204 the Rapture there I has something like Onward Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that scented bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down on their back smooth clean matching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word praise the Lord she was the word praise the lord we must be the word as you feed on the word you become the word praise the Lord so I keep asking if you have to feed on the word to become the word and you are not feeding on the word however do you become the word I don't have to say it but somebody that has never seen you should be able to look at your life and see the word of God in you they should be able to see God in you praise the Lord you are what you eat if you eat things that will make you sick you will get sick if you eat healthy you'll be healthy if you feed on the word for man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God you starve your soul when you deny it the word you starve your soul your real self when you can go a whole day without reading the word without consecrating yourself to the word without having a fellowship with God you are starving your so and some of us don't do it just in on a daily basis we do it weekly we do it monthly and sometimes we don't even know where our bibles are in the house how do you fellowship with God what relationship do you have with God your relationship with God tomorrow is determined with your relationship with God today if you do not have any relationship with God today it shows how much you will not have any relationship with him tomorrow it's just one simple step a day one simple step a day make sure that you are conscious of the presence of God make sure that you are in the will of God make sure that you are just living be in the word praise the Lord she was the word they looked like one out of every nation I was looking at it as they passed and seeing them that seeing them pass by instead of going down they started going up I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of line I screamed stay in line and the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming stay in line praise the Lord what makes a man or a woman to get out of line what makes a man or a woman to get out of line there is so much pressure in the world we are living in today and there is a lot to take our attention from the word of God and when you lose track of what God is doing in this day and age you you will give yourself to any Spirit if you lose track of god of what God is doing today you will settle for anything what makes a man to get out of track when the anchor holds the reason you will drift away with the current or with the flow is because you have no anchor there is no anchor it is God it is the word that does the anchoring is the word that would anchor your soul that it doesn't matter what happens to this flesh it doesn't matter what happens you know that deep inside of you you are anchored that if you should fall dead right now you know by the grace of God your soul is saved that you don't flow with the wind you don't just toss you are not tossed about like a ball on the on on on the sea being tossed by the waves in any direction no you are anchored and it is the word that keeps you a lot of the times we think we keep the word it is the word that is keeping you praise the Lord and when the word has anchored your soul praise the Lord my goodness they can do anything to the body they can starve you to death they can Slaughter you they can put you in the furnace they can feed you to the Lions they can saw you as Stander yes you feel the pain there is no doubt about it but you be glad you did like the three Hebrew children we know our God will deliver us and even if even if he chooses not to will still not bow we are ready to die for what we believe that is when the unor is holding I always ask how long would a man live in this life it is not how long you live that matters is what you have done with your life that matters metella lived the longest how many times do we talk about m in this room in this Auditorium how many times it's not how long you live but what you do with your life let us live a Christlike life that when we come to the end of our road and we have to leave we would go with joy and gladness that we will not regret it there is nothing to regret when you live this sinful world you have no regret whatsoever what have you to regret no regret whatsoever but you have everything to regret for if you forsake God if you turn God down if you live in sin and you die in sin there is everything to ever regret for praise the Lord the musicians can come over praise God
