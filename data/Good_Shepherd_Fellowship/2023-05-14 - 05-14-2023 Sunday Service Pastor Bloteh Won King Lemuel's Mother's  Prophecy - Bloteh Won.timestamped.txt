[1:12:37] for them the boys who beat in the front
[1:12:39] and the girls will be in the back
[1:12:41] you know while we have brother kennecaps
[1:12:44] here preaching for us one time ago and
[1:12:47] uh there's a story that you always tell
[1:12:50] he says when the Tabernacle was fell he
[1:12:53] grew up in Branham Tabernacle he said
[1:12:55] brother Branham will call all the kids
[1:12:57] to come and sit before the pulpit
[1:13:00] for them to give the seats to the
[1:13:02] visitors so the kids will come and sit
[1:13:04] before the pulpit and they will not be
[1:13:07] looking at brother Branham they will be
[1:13:08] looking at their parents so a parent
[1:13:11] will have the opportunity to be sitting
[1:13:13] there and seeing their child biting
[1:13:16] their finger or maybe sleeping
[1:13:21] while they sit on in the puppet front
[1:13:23] and brother Branham is preaching
[1:13:26] but then he said brother Brandon will
[1:13:28] always say he will say bless you little
[1:13:32] ones for giving your seat
[1:13:34] to the visitors
[1:13:35] you have done something for the Lord
[1:13:40] praise the Lord
[1:13:42] and uh
[1:13:44] uh my first year I mean that was back

[1:13:51] Africa preaching I met at all uh a
[1:13:54] gentlemen no sending me from here
[1:13:56] sending me from here
[1:13:58] like he gave his dad his seat he'd have
[1:14:00] a seat in front of you
[1:14:02] I'm just talking about them so she said
[1:14:04] they are my friends I will work with
[1:14:06] them
[1:14:08] praise the Lord I met an old old
[1:14:10] gentleman he was one of this way
[1:14:14] okay
[1:14:19] oh Johnny he was one of the one of the
[1:14:21] the oldest preacher there in uh in in
[1:14:25] South Africa the uncle to Jordan is a
[1:14:27] friend of mine and then uh
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:32] you know after we we Minister for them
[1:14:34] he was telling me you know uh last story
[1:14:37] he said so
[1:14:39] he told me and he said
[1:14:40] because he was sitting in the front he
[1:14:43] was sitting right in the front staring
[1:14:44] in my face I mean this man was preaching
[1:14:46] before I was even born
[1:14:49] and then he told me and after the chef
[1:14:50] he said you know I've always loved to
[1:14:52] sit in the front just from a little boy
[1:14:57] always loved because I believe that the
[1:14:59] word meets you first before it gets to
[1:15:01] the people back then
[1:15:05] praise the Lord
[1:15:07] amen
[1:15:09] so yeah we will try and work with our
[1:15:11] little one say man we want to we want to
[1:15:14] work on the attention span and uh you
[1:15:18] know uh teach them to take notes and now
[1:15:22] to be biting their finger and playing on
[1:15:24] their phone in order so so let's get
[1:15:27] right into what we want to talk about
[1:15:28] here so uh this name uh
[1:15:33] if you if you watch that name carefully
[1:15:36] you will realize that the name
[1:15:41] sounds similar as Emmanuel
[1:15:46] okay it sounds similar as a matter it
[1:15:50] does not means there though uh but you
[1:15:53] will realize that it was it was uh
[1:15:57] Solomon what Solomon is doing here and
[1:16:00] what I want to do this morning as we
[1:16:03] talk on Mother's Day Solomon is taking
[1:16:06] his mother Council
[1:16:08] as a prophecy
[1:16:12] what his mother advised him
[1:16:15] as a Young Man
[1:16:17] he's taken there he has grown up
[1:16:20] he has gone into the eras of of his
[1:16:24] thousand adulterous women
[1:16:27] he's now remembering
[1:16:29] that's a little boy his mother advised
[1:16:32] him and say my baby
[1:16:35] don't give yourself to drink
[1:16:38] don't give yourself to strange woman
[1:16:42] so Solomon is going to take his mother
[1:16:45] counsel
[1:16:48] and then he's going to compare it to who
[1:16:51] can find a virtuous woman
[1:16:55] praise the Lord
[1:16:56] Solomon is going to tell you that you
[1:17:00] will never be a successful husband
[1:17:03] if you despise your mother counsel
[1:17:10] VES because your first girlfriend
[1:17:12] supposed to be your mama
[1:17:14] yeah
[1:17:15] just like a boy a girl first boyfriend
[1:17:18] supposed to be her daddy
[1:17:23] we pray that the Lord will help us here
[1:17:25] amen
[1:17:26] don't worry we'll keep telling you happy
[1:17:28] Mother's Day
[1:17:31] praise the Lord
[1:17:34] okay I have in uh
[1:17:39] okay
[1:17:40] kind of work on these things a little
[1:17:42] bit late so so uh if you if you look
[1:17:45] here in the Prof in in verse 2
[1:17:48] Solomon says his his mama said oh what
[1:17:52] my son what the son of my womb the son
[1:17:55] of My Vow that's that that's where the
[1:17:58] name comes from the Son Of My Vow
[1:18:04] and the last economy means belong to God
[1:18:09] that's what the names means belongs to
[1:18:12] God
[1:18:13] it was a symbolic name for Solomon
[1:18:17] so Solomon is taking his mother counsel
[1:18:21] as a prophecy
[1:18:26] praise the Lord that's why you don't
[1:18:28] play with your mama worse
[1:18:32] your mother might never go to church
[1:18:36] she might never believe in the Lord
[1:18:39] Jesus
[1:18:41] but she prayed
[1:18:45] she prayed
[1:18:48] because bunch of all religious people we
[1:18:50] only think that you pray when you get on
[1:18:52] your knees and live for your hands
[1:18:55] but any hot cry to God it's a prayer
[1:19:00] the Bible said why he got laid down
[1:19:03] there she wept
[1:19:08] and God here from heaven
[1:19:11] Hallelujah
[1:19:19] praise the Lord
[1:19:23] now you will realize that when Solomon
[1:19:25] was born the Bible says a second Samuel
[1:19:30] there
[1:19:31] uh
[1:19:33] okay
[1:19:35] and David
[1:19:38] comfortable Sheba his wife after the
[1:19:41] first child died
[1:19:43] and waiting on to hurt and lay with herd
[1:19:45] and she beared a son and he called his
[1:19:49] name Solomon now David was the one that
[1:19:53] gave him that name Solomon
[1:19:56] which means peace
[1:20:01] David is saying God has comforted me
[1:20:06] praise the Lord amen but watch the
[1:20:09] scripture here the Bible says he called
[1:20:11] his name Solomon
[1:20:13] and the Lord loveth the child
[1:20:18] and he sent
[1:20:21] God loved the child so much that he said
[1:20:24] by the hand of net on the prophet and he
[1:20:27] called his name Jedediah
[1:20:31] because of the Lord
[1:20:34] which means beloved of the Lord
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:40] so God called him you are my beloved
[1:20:45] Solomon said
[1:20:47] you bring comfort and peace to me
[1:20:51] Beersheba said you are the child of my
[1:20:55] vowed
[1:20:57] I give you to God
[1:21:04] praise the Lord
[1:21:07] you know you always gets silent on The
[1:21:10] Dean on table when the food is sweet
[1:21:13] so your silence don't trouble me
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:17] praise the Lord
[1:21:19] I know that you are you are swallowing
[1:21:21] something down
[1:21:28] are we together
[1:21:30] praise the Lord
[1:21:32] praise the Lord
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:45] so Solomon year
[1:21:49] is bringing to us
[1:21:51] a real time
[1:21:53] mother the message
[1:21:57] praise the Lord
[1:21:59] amen
[1:22:01] you have to realize that Solomon wrote
[1:22:03] the book of proverb after
[1:22:06] he
[1:22:08] Hasa
[1:22:11] reconciled with the Lord Pro uh
[1:22:14] ecclesiastic show the the fully of
[1:22:17] Solomon
[1:22:19] and uh uh uh Proverbs show the wisdom of
[1:22:23] Solomon amen
[1:22:25] now so
[1:22:27] this is what we want to look at here
[1:22:29] he's he's trying to make us to see his
[1:22:33] mother counsel that I said young man
[1:22:37] her mother would call to him limel
[1:22:39] you know it is it is now for King to
[1:22:43] drink wine
[1:22:46] give now that strength unto women
[1:22:50] praise the Lord
[1:22:52] are we together
[1:22:54] now because you what what you have to
[1:22:56] realize here in structural context is
[1:22:59] that
[1:23:00] because of
[1:23:02] the the way Solomon was born the way
[1:23:05] belsheba came into the kingdom the way
[1:23:08] she became a wife unto David
[1:23:13] she was not
[1:23:15] the favorite neither was her children
[1:23:18] the favorite
[1:23:21] praise the Lord
[1:23:23] if you actually look at the Psalms of
[1:23:27] David Absalom was the favorite
[1:23:32] David loved Absalom and even the people
[1:23:35] love Absalom
[1:23:37] but it was God
[1:23:39] by the prophet Nathan
[1:23:42] that took David
[1:23:44] it will be none of your sons but this
[1:23:47] child that was born
[1:23:49] out of their Sheba
[1:23:53] praise the Lord
[1:23:56] it was God's choice
[1:24:01] are we together
[1:24:04] it's amazing
[1:24:06] it's a story of Grace and Redemption
[1:24:10] amen
[1:24:13] it's a story of Grace and Redemption
[1:24:17] and let me see if we can uh we can I can
[1:24:21] I can show you there
[1:24:23] uh
[1:24:26] I'm I'm a little bit ahead of myself
[1:24:28] here praise the Lord
[1:24:30] I'm a little bit ahead of myself but
[1:24:32] it's it's okay we'll be fine
[1:24:35] now brother Branham said this I wanted
[1:24:37] to read this before I get into my all of
[1:24:39] my alone talking this morning yeah the
[1:24:41] other day that I was talking to a mother
[1:24:43] on the telephone and the mother said oh
[1:24:47] brother Brandon
[1:24:49] Oh Billy she said my poor boy
[1:24:54] poor boy is in trouble
[1:24:56] saying oh what a trouble he's in
[1:24:59] I said yes but Brown knew what was
[1:25:02] happening I know about it dear sister
[1:25:05] and she said
[1:25:08] he may be wrong I don't know say one
[1:25:11] said this the other said that I don't
[1:25:14] know but said no matter whether he's
[1:25:18] wrong or right
[1:25:20] I love him
[1:25:25] that's a mother's heart
[1:25:29] because there is no babush for a child
[1:25:36] there you are I love him
[1:25:41] he's here to his mother said I have been
[1:25:43] so deceived by this and that said mother
[1:25:48] I believe you are about the only sweet
[1:25:52] heart I really have
[1:25:56] a woman there's truth to mean and stick
[1:26:00] with me
[1:26:02] that's mother's love
[1:26:05] there's a real mother
[1:26:08] thou will put her arm around her baby
[1:26:11] regardless
[1:26:13] whether he or she is wrong or right
[1:26:21] praise the Lord
[1:26:22] she goes right on
[1:26:25] to him
[1:26:27] and if a mother can think about her baby
[1:26:30] how much more
[1:26:32] will God think about his
[1:26:35] praise the Lord because the virtue of
[1:26:39] motherhood comes from God
[1:26:41] chavel he is the breasted one
[1:26:45] are we together
[1:26:47] that special bounding of a mother and a
[1:26:51] child
[1:26:52] the prophet of God explain it to us he
[1:26:55] said because
[1:26:56] the the womb is right under the heart
[1:27:00] so they'll create the connection
[1:27:03] that a mother has with her baby
[1:27:08] are we together
[1:27:11] and he also said this teaching on Moses
[1:27:14] he said in God how we thank thee this
[1:27:17] time be for motherhood a real mother
[1:27:21] in the midst of all the darkness and
[1:27:24] adultery and felt in Corruption of the
[1:27:27] word yet we got real genuine mothers
[1:27:32] praise the Lord how we thank thee for
[1:27:35] them young and all both alike we thank
[1:27:39] thee father for real motherhood and we
[1:27:43] pray God
[1:27:44] that you will bless them
[1:27:48] is that your prayer
[1:27:49] let's give the Lord a hand of praise
[1:27:51] [Applause]
[1:27:57] thank you Lord
[1:27:59] amen amen amen
[1:28:03] Hallelujah
[1:28:05] so we see here
[1:28:08] we want to look into this thing here uh
[1:28:14] Solomon
[1:28:16] is now going to take this
[1:28:19] prophecy
[1:28:22] which of course like I said is actually
[1:28:24] his mama Council
[1:28:26] he's going to take his mother Council
[1:28:31] and because everything that her mother
[1:28:34] advised him
[1:28:36] he saw it coming to pass in his life
[1:28:40] he took it as a prophecy
[1:28:45] and he wrote it among his proverbs
[1:28:51] praise the Lord
[1:28:54] now just like I said like I said we see
[1:28:56] grace here you go to Matthew chapter one
[1:28:58] let's read verse one the bulk of the
[1:29:02] generation of Jesus Christ the son of
[1:29:04] David the son of Abraham Abraham beget
[1:29:06] Isaac Isaac beget Jacob Jacob beget
[1:29:10] Judah in his brethroughs and Judah began
[1:29:13] pharaohs and Zara of tema
[1:29:16] praise the Lord
[1:29:17] verse 5 and Simon bequette begin Boaz of
[1:29:22] Rahab so Boaz the Maori Ruth his mother
[1:29:27] was Rahab
[1:29:30] from Jericho
[1:29:32] are we together
[1:29:34] now this is the generation of Jesus
[1:29:37] Christ
[1:29:39] and as you continue to read Boaz beget
[1:29:43] or belt of Ruth
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:46] and Jesse verse 6 beget David the king
[1:29:52] and there they began Solomon of her
[1:29:56] there's been the wife of Urias
[1:30:01] now so in this generation of Jesus
[1:30:04] Christ there are five women that are
[1:30:07] listed
[1:30:10] five
[1:30:13] women that are listed in the generation
[1:30:15] of Jesus Christ which of course is is
[1:30:18] not normal in biblical party whenever
[1:30:21] they get to genology women are never
[1:30:24] placed in genology but when it comes to
[1:30:27] the genology of Jesus Christ five women
[1:30:30] are listed four of them are Gentile
[1:30:32] women
[1:30:33] and four of them did not have good
[1:30:37] testimony time she had to disguise
[1:30:40] herself
[1:30:41] I said how to get a c from Judah we know
[1:30:45] about rehab she was a street prostitute
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] we know it about Ruth she came from an
[1:30:54] insect's background
[1:30:56] lot's own daughter sleeping with him to
[1:31:00] have the moabites
[1:31:02] praise the Lord
[1:31:04] and here is Beersheba here also
[1:31:09] the woman
[1:31:10] that David committed adultery
[1:31:13] right around me in the message Grace he
[1:31:16] says
[1:31:17] it is it is now only David that is our
[1:31:20] fault he said Beersheba was negligent
[1:31:26] praise the Lord
[1:31:28] so we'll see here that we have four
[1:31:32] women
[1:31:34] four
[1:31:35] women that were tied four generation
[1:31:39] before a Warman
[1:31:42] that is a virgin will come on the scene
[1:31:48] so this is a story of Grace five is the
[1:31:52] number of Grace
[1:31:53] and the story of Grace is that God is
[1:31:57] bringing you from an abominable past to
[1:32:01] become a virgin bride you've been a
[1:32:04] virgin bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:07] your flesh
[1:32:09] [Applause]
[1:32:22] praise the Lord
[1:32:27] that's the reason why we must appreciate
[1:32:30] the grace of God
[1:32:34] we must appreciate the grace of God and
[1:32:38] let me tell you one thing about
[1:32:39] appreciation it is not you that give it
[1:32:43] that feel like you are appreciating nor
[1:32:46] is he that received
[1:32:50] praise the Lord so if a person tell you
[1:32:54] that and then not feel appreciated don't
[1:32:56] say but I appreciated you it is not you
[1:32:59] that give that determine appreciation is
[1:33:02] the one that receives
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:09] so it is not
[1:33:12] are you in a message Church
[1:33:15] well you you I mean you're living your
[1:33:17] best religious life I said God I
[1:33:19] appreciate your grace no it is he that
[1:33:21] determines
[1:33:32] this is your life story
[1:33:34] right here
[1:33:36] and right here is the grace of God
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:49] praise the Lord
[1:33:58] I have always bought for me
[1:34:01] thy God
[1:34:03] never cease to address this
[1:34:06] that even in the genology of Jesus
[1:34:10] Christ
[1:34:11] God will mention
[1:34:14] the one who was the wife
[1:34:25] in the genology of Jesus Christ
[1:34:28] God
[1:34:32] who acknowledge
[1:34:34] a one that will be a type of Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ for the millennium
[1:34:39] the son of David
[1:34:41] the promised Kingdom
[1:34:43] but yet
[1:34:44] God
[1:34:48] wife
[1:34:49] of your eyes
[1:34:51] praise the Lord
[1:34:53] amen
[1:34:55] do something
[1:34:57] and let the pastor mention it
[1:35:00] or let your parents mention it
[1:35:03] you get crazy about it
[1:35:08] you pick your flesh
[1:35:14] hundreds of years
[1:35:17] God
[1:35:19] praise the Lord
[1:35:21] all of this women you think about it all
[1:35:24] of these women do you know what it is
[1:35:26] with tema
[1:35:29] going around the city
[1:35:31] and everybody is saying you see that
[1:35:33] girl
[1:35:36] she disguise herself like a prostitute
[1:35:39] slept with her father-in-law
[1:35:43] but when it came to Judah he said she's
[1:35:46] more righteous than ah
[1:35:51] praise the Lord
[1:35:54] rehab
[1:35:58] praise the Lord
[1:36:01] rehab
[1:36:03] like a preacher said he says at the
[1:36:06] wedding of Rahab
[1:36:09] Joshua stood there
[1:36:11] and said is there one year that have a
[1:36:14] reason why
[1:36:17] this woman
[1:36:20] must not marry this man
[1:36:22] praise the Lord
[1:36:25] if you dare live for your hand you will
[1:36:27] be killed because all the accusations
[1:36:30] supposed to stay in Jericho
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:42] praise the Lord
[1:36:44] rope
[1:36:46] the first Kingsman
[1:36:49] one boy said you were redeem everything
[1:36:51] of Naomi he says I will redeem it
[1:36:53] says but you have to redeem Ruth he said
[1:36:56] no no
[1:36:58] she's more about
[1:37:01] it no
[1:37:05] he fulfilled his right
[1:37:09] because of Ruth
[1:37:14] what's your life story

[1:37:50] praise the Lord
[1:37:52] so we see Solomon here
[1:37:55] ASA is taking the the story that his
[1:38:00] mother told him
[1:38:02] and he's he's using that now for for uh
[1:38:07] a prophecy
[1:38:09] the words of the king
[1:38:11] the prophet said that his mother taught
[1:38:14] him
[1:38:16] the prophecy that his mother taught him
[1:38:19] that's Proverbs 1 verse 1.
[1:38:23] now so Solomon from verse 1
[1:38:27] 12 verse 9
[1:38:30] he repeated the words of his mother
[1:38:33] and then in verse 10 he counts us with
[1:38:37] the statement and he said
[1:38:40] who can find a veterans woman
[1:38:44] he never said who can find a virtuous
[1:38:47] women
[1:38:48] a virtuous woman
[1:38:53] praise the Lord
[1:38:55] amen he is dealing with a con the
[1:38:58] contracts of his mother
[1:39:03] praise the Lord and the contracts of all
[1:39:06] the women he have had in his life
[1:39:10] who can find a veterans woman
[1:39:13] now brother Branham will let us to know
[1:39:15] about that actually was a prophecy it
[1:39:18] was not about any certain woman
[1:39:20] right
[1:39:22] because Solomon have heart housing
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:28] so that was actually a prophecy
[1:39:32] and we can we can believe that it was a
[1:39:35] prophecy because we can see it right
[1:39:37] here
[1:39:38] someone is thinking the counsel of his
[1:39:41] mother as a prophesied and then he's
[1:39:44] comparing it to the many women he has
[1:39:47] had in his life and brother bear says
[1:39:50] the purpose of the many women was
[1:39:52] because of this marriage and divorce he
[1:39:55] says now look in the final analysis Lord
[1:39:59] there is one Jesus Christ is that right
[1:40:03] one man God Emmanuel do you believe that
[1:40:07] but but the members of his wives are
[1:40:11] many
[1:40:13] see thousand times thousands of
[1:40:15] thousands is that right his wife one
[1:40:19] wife bride the church you understand
[1:40:22] them but to get this marriage and
[1:40:25] therefore straighten out so that you who
[1:40:29] know which is right
[1:40:32] and which is wrong now he plainly shows
[1:40:37] here in tight
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:40] there is one Christ
[1:40:43] and many members
[1:40:46] of that wife one wife so Solomon many
[1:40:52] wives that he had was a type of the
[1:40:55] Bride coming from all around the world
[1:40:58] but she will be one bride
[1:41:02] amen there is no room for polygamy in
[1:41:05] this
[1:41:08] there is no teaching a polygali in this
[1:41:12] are we together
[1:41:18] it was a type
[1:41:22] it was a prophecy
[1:41:26] are we together
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:29] there is one Christ and many member of
[1:41:32] that wife noticed he can put us
[1:41:36] away for Spiritual fornication and false
[1:41:39] Doctrine at any time
[1:41:42] he want to
[1:41:44] anytime now let me tell you something if
[1:41:48] God wants to punch you away you don't
[1:41:50] have to kick you out of the church
[1:41:54] he can put you away by stop dealing with
[1:41:56] your heart
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:41:59] you can just become former in the church
[1:42:02] and all you have to do is complain
[1:42:04] nothing is working yeah yeah
[1:42:08] God don't have to kick you away from the
[1:42:10] church amen
[1:42:21] he can put us away for Spiritual
[1:42:23] fornication and false Doctrine false
[1:42:27] concept false teachings
[1:42:30] in a time he won't talk
[1:42:33] but how dare you
[1:42:36] how dare you
[1:42:38] try
[1:42:41] to put him away
[1:42:43] how dare you
[1:42:47] you will be digging your own grave with
[1:42:49] your teeth
[1:42:52] amen
[1:42:57] are we together
[1:42:59] so you see the contracts here he's
[1:43:02] taking his mother prophecy
[1:43:04] and he's comparing it with the many
[1:43:06] women who can find a veterans woman
[1:43:11] if you actually read that you go through
[1:43:14] that you will realize there is no one
[1:43:17] woman on Earth that holds all of these
[1:43:20] qualities
[1:43:23] no
[1:43:26] why because it's a many member deposit
[1:43:32] God deposited around the world
[1:43:35] because it was a prophecy
[1:43:37] now for the physical woman
[1:43:40] or a spiritual woman
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:43] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:43:48] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:43:51] for her price is far above rubies
[1:43:56] are we together
[1:43:59] you can go home later on your bed
[1:44:01] and read the rest
[1:44:04] praise the Lord
[1:44:05] you can either think about your life or
[1:44:08] think about the one you want to get
[1:44:09] married to
[1:44:11] but let's drop down yeah a little bit
[1:44:14] amen
[1:44:18] Hallelujah are we together see what he
[1:44:22] says here verse 29 he says many
[1:44:25] daughters
[1:44:27] have done virtuously
[1:44:31] many daughters have done virtuously but
[1:44:36] thou exceedeth them all
[1:44:40] praise the Lord
[1:44:42] when Luther came the hair told the the
[1:44:46] the the the the virtue of the word
[1:44:49] every Revival that came
[1:44:51] praise the Lord
[1:44:53] head toe
[1:44:55] the pureness of their word until the
[1:44:57] denominator so many daughters have done
[1:45:00] virtuously but thou has seated them all
[1:45:03] why because you heard to the opening of
[1:45:07] the seals
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:10] The Mystery of the hour
[1:45:12] this is the prophecy
[1:45:14] it's not about a physical woman
[1:45:19] reach
[1:45:22] favor
[1:45:24] is deceived deceitful and beauty
[1:45:28] is vain
[1:45:30] go in marriage and divorce you see
[1:45:31] brother I'm talking all of this he said
[1:45:33] Beauty you hardly like flowers in the
[1:45:35] church they like beautiful church and
[1:45:37] all of that you know so he he keeps
[1:45:39] comparing this in a spiritual form
[1:45:42] but a woman that fear of the Lord
[1:45:46] shall be praised
[1:45:50] give her of the fruit of her hand
[1:45:54] and let her own works
[1:45:57] praise her
[1:45:59] in the gate
[1:46:02] praise the Lord amen let
[1:46:06] The Works of her hands or her own hands
[1:46:10] let her praise her in the kids
[1:46:12] are we together
[1:46:14] praise the Lord
[1:46:16] now so
[1:46:18] we want to travel yet a little bit and
[1:46:20] see uh uh uh come to Dad brother Branham
[1:46:24] who says here we we have heard that over
[1:46:27] and over here he says after all the
[1:46:29] backbone of every nation is its Morris
[1:46:34] the backbone of every nation is the
[1:46:37] Morris the beauty of the church is the
[1:46:39] character of the people it is State the
[1:46:42] morals of the church
[1:46:44] amen
[1:46:46] Hallelujah
[1:46:49] the backbone of the home is not our bank
[1:46:52] account
[1:46:54] no
[1:46:56] the backbone of the home is the moral
[1:46:58] the standard the principle
[1:47:01] that's why I keep at home that's why I
[1:47:03] keep your family
[1:47:07] it's not our job titles it's not our
[1:47:09] bank account when the moral drops in a
[1:47:13] nation then the nation is gone
[1:47:17] mother holds broken
[1:47:19] you just might as well fought up
[1:47:24] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:47:26] this this uh the word can no longer hold
[1:47:30] why because
[1:47:35] the morals of the nation the Morris of
[1:47:37] the word is gone why because motherhood
[1:47:40] is broken
[1:47:43] are we together
[1:47:48] all other nations have done it and ours
[1:47:51] is no exception
[1:47:54] are we together the reason why is that
[1:47:58] Birdman in the message are invisible
[1:48:00] Union said God a woman
[1:48:04] is entrusted with certain characters
[1:48:07] that she must not Define
[1:48:10] she is entrusted to that there is no
[1:48:14] creature on earth like a woman not even
[1:48:18] a man
[1:48:19] brother Brown said no creature he never
[1:48:21] said no animal like the woman he said no
[1:48:23] creature
[1:48:25] nothing that is Created from God why
[1:48:28] because he said but because she was cast
[1:48:31] over on their side she has also been
[1:48:35] given a sacred charge from God
[1:48:39] for let's say together four
[1:48:44] four Redemption
[1:48:46] so the prophet of God yet is going to
[1:48:48] teach us that the three sacred virtue
[1:48:50] that is given to the woman
[1:48:52] it was now only because of marriage it
[1:48:54] was because of redemption that's the
[1:48:57] reason why the promise of redemption was
[1:48:59] given to the woman in in Genesis Chapter
[1:49:02] 3 The Seed of the woman
[1:49:05] the promise was not given to the man it
[1:49:07] was not a seed of a man it was the seed
[1:49:10] of a woman a woman having a seed with no
[1:49:13] man influence
[1:49:16] now so he's making us to realize that
[1:49:19] God gave a woman these three sacraments
[1:49:23] you just like he gave to the church
[1:49:25] so he says that he was given to her
[1:49:28] because of redemption
[1:49:32] God's greater plane in his mind the
[1:49:36] plane of redemption
[1:49:37] he hear the secret of redemption in the
[1:49:41] woman
[1:49:42] that's the reason why he shot the Earth
[1:49:45] it was dark
[1:49:47] the man was asleep
[1:49:50] and he took the woman into a separate
[1:49:52] place
[1:49:53] and give her this vacuum
[1:49:56] praise the Lord
[1:49:59] amen
[1:50:01] like we have said and taught many times
[1:50:04] a woman power is
[1:50:09] not in competing with man
[1:50:15] a woman could be more smarter than a man
[1:50:18] but yet her power is not in her
[1:50:21] knowledge
[1:50:22] her power is in her virtue
[1:50:27] praise the Lord
[1:50:30] it's in her virtue
[1:50:33] is something that God gave her
[1:50:38] and it's a sacred charge that God gave
[1:50:41] to her for one purpose
[1:50:46] one purpose
[1:50:48] for what
[1:50:51] for what
[1:50:53] praise the Lord for Redemption
[1:50:56] that's what he was given to her
[1:51:01] are we together
[1:51:04] amen
[1:51:10] now so we see it here
[1:51:13] these three sacred trusts is
[1:51:18] a virgin saying
[1:51:20] a Womanhood
[1:51:22] in her motherhood
[1:51:26] praise the Lord
[1:51:27] so God gave her this this sacred Trust
[1:51:32] he designed her that way
[1:51:35] amen a man can go and take uh female
[1:51:39] hormones whatever to change his body and
[1:51:41] all of that God did not give him that
[1:51:43] virtue
[1:51:46] praise the Lord amen amen he can try and
[1:51:50] pretend and talk like a woman and swing
[1:51:52] your hand like this and all of that just
[1:51:54] step on his toe he will do his muscle
[1:51:55] like
[1:52:05] yeah yeah yeah
[1:52:08] just confront him a little bit
[1:52:10] you'll soon see the man stop coming out
[1:52:16] because you was not given to him
[1:52:23] like I said by Nature think about it by
[1:52:27] Nature Nature design it
[1:52:29] nobody make it a recommendation it's
[1:52:33] nature that design it
[1:52:36] that kindergarten are always taught by
[1:52:40] women
[1:52:43] go to Alice cool around the world
[1:52:46] you will never find a man teaching
[1:52:49] kindergarten
[1:52:56] who bear with those little children
[1:53:04] it's a good Guinea
[1:53:08] they don't even know about it in the
[1:53:10] Bible they're never ready in the message
[1:53:14] but yet nature tells them
[1:53:17] that a man have a short spin
[1:53:20] to spend with little kids
[1:53:23] praise the Lord
[1:53:28] I'm tired I'm tired
[1:53:34] it's not designed that way
[1:53:49] glory be to God
[1:53:52] Hallelujah
[1:53:54] Hallelujah
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:58] are we together
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:01] she's she's designed that way that's the
[1:54:04] reason why we must be proud
[1:54:06] young women we must be proud
[1:54:11] because that's your strength
[1:54:15] that's your strength
[1:54:17] that's where your power and your
[1:54:19] Authority is
[1:54:25] over
[1:54:32] it's not it's not it's not in it's not
[1:54:35] in competition
[1:54:37] it's not in competition I mean you might
[1:54:39] you might get angry and just talk talk
[1:54:41] talk talk talk maybe the man get tired
[1:54:43] he came quiet and you think you have won
[1:54:48] because yeah
[1:54:51] but that's not where your strength is
[1:54:56] your strength is hidden
[1:54:59] and by Nature
[1:55:01] everything of Great Value God hate it
[1:55:07] the diamonds I had in the Earth
[1:55:10] the gold I hid in the Earth
[1:55:14] the minerals of the word I hid in the
[1:55:18] Earth the virtue of life
[1:55:21] life hate in a woman
[1:55:26] she was called the mother of all living
[1:55:38] are we together
[1:55:42] so we are looking at this prophecy
[1:55:47] Solomon remembering his mother counsel
[1:55:56] you are the son of My Vow
[1:56:01] can't
[1:56:03] don't give themselves to wine
[1:56:06] you would get drunk and you will abuse
[1:56:09] your power
[1:56:13] praise the Lord
[1:56:18] some don't give yourself to strange
[1:56:19] women
[1:56:24] Solomon is remembering
[1:56:27] counsel his mother gave him
[1:56:31] see God designed it that way people
[1:56:35] he designed it that way
[1:56:38] when the Bible says in the image of God
[1:56:41] he made man
[1:56:43] male and female
[1:56:46] that's the perfect representation of God
[1:56:52] the male and female representation
[1:56:59] that's the perfect representation of God
[1:57:03] it types the word and the spirit
[1:57:06] God will always keep there because
[1:57:08] that's what brings balance to life
[1:57:14] praise the Lord
[1:57:17] amen
[1:57:19] he designed it that way
[1:57:24] that there is there there have to be a
[1:57:26] father
[1:57:27] and a mother
[1:57:30] that's the reason why this word in this
[1:57:32] craziness is not going to work
[1:57:34] it is not going to work
[1:57:38] God did not design two men to raise a
[1:57:41] child
[1:57:42] he did not design two women no matter
[1:57:44] how how your pink Y how they distract
[1:57:47] God they're not design it that way
[1:57:51] because it is not just dwelling together
[1:57:56] it is what
[1:57:58] the tenderness of a child withdraw
[1:58:02] from each of the parents
[1:58:05] it's not the toys you give them or the
[1:58:09] money
[1:58:10] is the thing that their innocent soul
[1:58:14] pulls from you
[1:58:19] praise the Lord
[1:58:23] amen
[1:58:27] they pulls from you that's why the
[1:58:28] prophet of God says the children of God
[1:58:30] I mean the little children they have the
[1:58:33] the uh the greatest ability to forgive
[1:58:37] you whip them you punish them after a
[1:58:40] while they run right back into your arms
[1:58:42] why they do that because there is
[1:58:45] something there's a connection
[1:58:48] that they pulls from you and the way
[1:58:50] almighty God designed it is that with
[1:58:53] with with the photo with uh uh uh
[1:58:56] parenting God designed it in a way that
[1:58:59] that the the the the the the position of
[1:59:02] the male will will begin to fill
[1:59:07] that emotional path in the young woman
[1:59:11] praise the Lord
[1:59:12] amen
[1:59:14] if God can help us to be Godly fathers
[1:59:17] and the right kind of for men in our
[1:59:19] home and we fill that place where it is
[1:59:24] not just a a setting our our own
[1:59:28] personal standards but what it's going
[1:59:30] to do is that it's going to bring their
[1:59:33] young woman to the place where I I mean
[1:59:36] she sees setting quality in her father
[1:59:42] amen that as she love her father
[1:59:46] she will want to find a man
[1:59:49] that she can find to see me
[1:59:52] and the same thing with the mother
[1:59:56] God designing their way
[1:59:59] praise the Lord
[2:00:01] people say why are you just like that
[2:00:03] boys love their mother no that's the way
[2:00:06] God designed it
[2:00:10] he designed it that way because it's
[2:00:13] right in US
[2:00:16] amen a young boy get at a certain place
[2:00:19] as soon as he started getting around 18
[2:00:22] 20 for some reason
[2:00:25] he turned to like the Friendship of
[2:00:28] girls
[2:00:29] it's not because he's womanizing it is
[2:00:32] that thing in him
[2:00:35] because that's the full image it has to
[2:00:38] be a male and female
[2:00:42] so he needs the guidance he needs the
[2:00:45] instruction
[2:00:48] praise the Lord he needs to have a Godly
[2:00:51] mother where he can trust
[2:00:52] and start to tell his feelings stop
[2:00:56] the same thing with a young woman she
[2:00:59] gets around that edge she has a bunch
[2:01:01] the whole house is filled with sisters
[2:01:03] but yes she likes to talk to boys
[2:01:09] it's a design
[2:01:12] that's the way God because that's the
[2:01:14] image male and female
[2:01:16] it has to be there
[2:01:22] praise the Lord so Solomon here dealing
[2:01:25] with this prophecy he's bringing us to
[2:01:27] the place to realize that
[2:01:30] in one sense he's appreciating his
[2:01:33] mother
[2:01:35] but yet in another sense he's saying
[2:01:38] failure to listen to my mother's counsel
[2:01:43] I left me in the hands of adulterous
[2:01:45] women
[2:01:54] praise the Lord whether you like it or
[2:01:57] not you can learn all you want to learn
[2:01:59] from Google
[2:02:03] what we are talking about is God's Lord
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:07] it's a law of God
[2:02:13] praise the Lord
[2:02:14] amen that's why Paul who says it's a
[2:02:16] commandment
[2:02:17] that comes with a promise pair of
[2:02:20] children obeying your parents
[2:02:32] glory be to God Amen
[2:02:37] now to be too personal yeah
[2:02:40] but there was one time
[2:02:42] uh because of the situation back home 90
[2:02:46] 1993 that left my Paris
[2:02:50] I moved to another region because the
[2:02:53] place was getting
[2:02:54] biting you know and all the child
[2:02:58] soldiers and all of that I moved to
[2:03:00] another region and that was that was uh
[2:03:03] the end of uh towards the end of 93-94
[2:03:06] and God bless us there uh we started a
[2:03:10] little group a little church there and
[2:03:12] all of that and then from there we moved
[2:03:14] over to the Articles because of trouble
[2:03:16] and all of that
[2:03:18] but it was it was about five seven years
[2:03:21] I've gone without my parents
[2:03:24] just a young man
[2:03:25] and uh uh you know doing the best that
[2:03:29] we knew how to do for the Lord at the
[2:03:30] time
[2:03:32] they came a certain time in my life I
[2:03:34] felt like I needed to go back home
[2:03:37] I just had that that pulled on me
[2:03:40] and I will tell you that choice
[2:03:44] changed my life
[2:03:47] I felt I needed to go back home I felt
[2:03:50] that I I I I I uh all my parents some
[2:03:54] explanation
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:03:57] maybe my father was I mean he was not a
[2:04:00] message believer need of my mother my
[2:04:02] stepmother was not a message believer so
[2:04:04] where we were as a young believer with
[2:04:07] everything that was happening I was
[2:04:09] trying to you know serve the Lord in the
[2:04:11] best that I knew but there were many
[2:04:13] things I was doing wrong when you get
[2:04:16] over zealous and I use you stopped you
[2:04:18] think now you know truth you can talk to
[2:04:21] your parents anyhow
[2:04:22] the Bible say the scripture says
[2:04:28] I feel like I needed to go back home
[2:04:31] so I went home
[2:04:34] and they were all happy to see me
[2:04:35] especially my my mother my stepmother
[2:04:39] blessed memory
[2:04:41] you know uh
[2:04:44] I remember her weeping
[2:04:46] and you know she called All My Sisters
[2:04:49] and you know and and told them to
[2:04:52] Prevail or mean to stay
[2:04:55] but I really never came to say
[2:04:58] so after spending some time with them I
[2:05:01] told him I want to talk to them when
[2:05:03] they were in my dad's room I mean I I
[2:05:06] will now say is that I calculated this
[2:05:08] in my mind I would just say that it was
[2:05:10] the grace of God
[2:05:13] it was after that I knew what a blessing
[2:05:17] it was
[2:05:20] sat with my parents
[2:05:22] and how to apologize to them for
[2:05:25] everything that I did
[2:05:26] and I was I was I was pastoring at the
[2:05:29] time as a young man I would not even
[2:05:31] married yet
[2:05:33] and then I shop with them
[2:05:35] and I
[2:05:37] talked to them and all of that my my
[2:05:39] mother she just had one thing in her
[2:05:41] mind
[2:05:42] tell me that you are here to stay
[2:05:44] all she had you know you know she was
[2:05:47] glad to see me and she said no you have
[2:05:49] to stay I said no mama I have to go back
[2:05:51] you know I couldn't tell her you know
[2:05:54] I'm a pastor of a church and that was
[2:05:56] that that was not the purpose the
[2:05:58] purpose was just to be able to reconcile
[2:06:01] with my parents because they never
[2:06:02] wanted me to leave at the time
[2:06:05] but I felt like my life was so much in a
[2:06:08] danger
[2:06:10] because there are things by the grace of
[2:06:13] God I I just couldn't do
[2:06:16] you know so I sat them down I told them
[2:06:18] I was living I'm going to be okay and so
[2:06:23] because I felt like they you know they
[2:06:26] were not too happy for me to leave so I
[2:06:29] need to go back home and they were just
[2:06:31] different things that I apologize
[2:06:33] because I knew as a young believer
[2:06:35] you know I'll take care of my my parents
[2:06:38] clothes and my mom she would bring her
[2:06:40] trousers I tell her mama we might not
[2:06:42] supposed to wear trouser I'm not washing
[2:06:44] it
[2:06:47] that's not the scripture young people
[2:06:50] that's not the scripture
[2:06:53] it's just a foolish zeal
[2:06:56] and
[2:06:56] praise the Lord
[2:06:58] you are supposed to live the word
[2:07:01] live a life where your parents will be
[2:07:05] convinced
[2:07:08] not criticize them
[2:07:12] not condemn them but live a life get
[2:07:16] salty
[2:07:18] where your parents will become testy
[2:07:24] so you know we sat down and I I sell all
[2:07:26] of that and laughing
[2:07:28] you know and
[2:07:30] but uh
[2:07:33] daddy told me he said Son
[2:07:35] say I'm proud of you
[2:07:37] is it because you know I led one of his
[2:07:40] friends to the Lord
[2:07:43] and when the man went back home
[2:07:45] you know he told my father
[2:07:48] you know so he he asked me he says you
[2:07:50] know Samuel I said yeah he says you know
[2:07:53] he came home he told me the good thing
[2:07:54] about you proud of you
[2:07:57] and I spent a couple of weeks there I
[2:07:59] had to go back and I went back
[2:08:02] but I will tell you
[2:08:04] that affected me
[2:08:07] it did not made me reach
[2:08:11] but it affected me in such a powerful
[2:08:15] way
[2:08:18] in such a powerful
[2:08:22] praise the Lord
[2:08:26] so Solomon is dealing with the same year
[2:08:30] he's dealing with the same he's looking
[2:08:32] back into his life
[2:08:35] to remember him
[2:08:37] the childhood counsel
[2:08:40] of his mother
[2:08:45] praise the Lord
[2:08:48] and
[2:08:50] I will leave you here in few minutes
[2:08:53] I see remember these things
[2:08:56] he goes back to uh
[2:09:01] different thoughts
[2:09:06] Hallelujah you love the Lord amen
[2:09:12] now so
[2:09:15] he's associating
[2:09:18] the blessing not because it's easy
[2:09:22] it's easy to look into
[2:09:26] the life of his parents
[2:09:29] and even think about all their mistakes
[2:09:31] that they made before he was born
[2:09:36] when we get religious and we think that
[2:09:39] we are righteous we call that the Holy
[2:09:42] Ghost
[2:09:44] and we start to look into our parents
[2:09:46] life
[2:09:49] and we start to condemn them
[2:09:53] and we appreciate these people
[2:09:56] that we watch on Hollywood
[2:10:00] why some kind of a law of him
[2:10:02] people that have been divorced four or
[2:10:05] five times
[2:10:07] it says well he love his wife that's
[2:10:09] that's the way Mary is supposed to be
[2:10:11] you know about it
[2:10:21] praise the Lord
[2:10:24] we think now we are so smart
[2:10:28] because we have gone to school and we
[2:10:30] have a little certificate I'm not coming
[2:10:32] I'm not coming to you it's a promise
[2:10:33] congratulations
[2:10:38] praise the Lord
[2:10:40] amen
[2:10:42] because we think we are smart now we
[2:10:44] have a little certificate degree in our
[2:10:47] hands but I used to be that time now it
[2:10:49] is not like that
[2:10:54] but we can learn from the prophet the
[2:10:56] prophecy of Solomon let me close here
[2:11:00] the Lord give us another time to
[2:11:02] continue we can learn from the prophet
[2:11:05] of Solomon
[2:11:06] to realize that
[2:11:15] you will never know
[2:11:18] the amount of prayers
[2:11:23] that your mama pray
[2:11:27] just like I said she don't have don't
[2:11:29] tell me say she's in the message or no I
[2:11:31] don't want to know that yeah
[2:11:32] because nature tells me
[2:11:36] when a child is in the womb of a mother
[2:11:42] every time she feeds a kick
[2:11:46] or the pain
[2:11:48] every expression
[2:11:51] is a prayer
[2:11:54] prayer because prayer what is prayer is
[2:11:57] the utterance of the heart
[2:11:59] it's not a mouth
[2:12:01] it's the arteries of the heart
[2:12:14] when the mother feed patient oh God help
[2:12:16] me
[2:12:17] she had just prayed for you
[2:12:22] she have even lay hands on you
[2:12:26] before you start going to all of these
[2:12:28] church and falling in the spirit
[2:12:32] the first person that lay hands on you
[2:12:34] or your mama every time she hear her
[2:12:36] stomach
[2:12:49] that's the reason why
[2:12:51] as a young man or the young woman
[2:12:54] if you despise your parents
[2:12:58] because now you come to know all their
[2:13:00] thoughts
[2:13:03] you know you even know their salary you
[2:13:05] can take care of you other people are
[2:13:07] doing this for their children and and me
[2:13:09] and just this
[2:13:11] you are using your teeth
[2:13:13] to dig your grave
[2:13:29] praise the Lord
[2:13:31] it's listening towards a war story
[2:13:36] of a man
[2:13:37] they had a little girl
[2:13:40] came by from war
[2:13:43] it was sick
[2:13:46] he couldn't care for his girl anymore
[2:13:53] and at the time they all finishing they
[2:13:56] were taking a lot of children
[2:13:58] and uh
[2:14:01] the place was so full so he took his
[2:14:03] daughter there
[2:14:04] and told
[2:14:07] the people there I'm sick
[2:14:10] I want to leave her here at the
[2:14:12] orphanage they said no
[2:14:13] we I want to take him
[2:14:17] children
[2:14:18] whose parents are dead
[2:14:22] we are not taking
[2:14:24] children have half parents
[2:14:27] so the man said he says
[2:14:29] is that the requirement
[2:14:33] they say yes
[2:14:34] he says
[2:14:36] you take her in few days I will meet
[2:14:40] that requirement
[2:14:43] hmm
[2:14:44] he left his daughter and committed
[2:14:46] suicide
[2:14:49] because he wanted
[2:14:51] a better care
[2:14:53] he knew that he could not do it
[2:15:01] that's the heart
[2:15:17] musicians you can come
[2:15:26] I've always said
[2:15:35] if you disrespect your father your
[2:15:37] parents
[2:15:58] parents might not be able to get
[2:16:00] everything right
[2:16:03] but you think about it
[2:16:06] have you seen the the Divine Providence
[2:16:09] of God
[2:16:13] turn this back on
[2:16:17] you keep interpreting while you're
[2:16:19] playing
[2:16:22] it was in God's Divine Providence
[2:16:31] his design unique design
[2:16:36] brought you through those parents
[2:16:42] he could make you the child of uh uh
[2:16:45] Donald Trump
[2:16:46] with a fairly fisted or Bill Gates
[2:16:51] all the richest men in the world
[2:16:55] but it was God's design
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:05] it was a choice that he made
[2:17:09] [Music]
[2:17:18] I don't care what job you have it's very
[2:17:21] important and how much
[2:17:28] membership
[2:17:29] you were never
[2:17:47] the prophecy of lamel's mother
[2:17:55] his mother counselor
[2:18:01] they have now become a prophecy prophecy
[2:18:06] because he realized that he did not list
[2:18:09] him to Mama
[2:18:17] together
[2:18:26] in the Stillness
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:39] just memories
