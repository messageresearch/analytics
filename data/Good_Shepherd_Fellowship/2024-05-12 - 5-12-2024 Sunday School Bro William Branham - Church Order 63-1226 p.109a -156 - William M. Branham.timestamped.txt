[1:07] for
[1:15] [Music]
[1:36] got a question mark as many are riding
[1:39] the office and blaming you for the
[1:43] action on the
[1:45] tapes also about others around the
[1:49] church selling tapes if Mr Maguire has
[1:54] to pay royalties on them all right
[1:59] the tapes is by
[2:02] contract and by I don't know just
[2:05] exactly when a contract is
[2:08] expired but the
[2:11] trustees this belongs to the trustees
[2:14] not the deacons the trustees not the
[2:16] pastor
[2:18] trustees the
[2:20] trustees ever so often they they write a
[2:24] contract as I understand it if this this
[2:26] is wrong then the trustee's correct
[2:30] um these trustees has an agreement with
[2:34] the person who is making the tapes and
[2:37] the tapes are by
[2:39] franchise no one else can make tapes
[2:42] unless it be permitted by the person
[2:44] that has the
[2:45] franchise and it cannot be sold unless
[2:48] permitted by the person that has the
[2:50] franchise because that's the law see
[2:54] that the franchise holds it see and if
[2:57] the one who holds a franchise wants to
[3:00] let so and so make tapes that's up to
[3:03] him he wants to let everybody make tapes
[3:05] that's up to him he wants everybody sell
[3:07] tapes that's up to the person who holds
[3:09] the franchise he should have a a little
[3:12] written note signed from the holder of
[3:16] the franchise to make him sell tape
[3:18] because then he's clearing the law
[3:20] because you don't the man has a
[3:21] franchise on you be liveable yourself to
[3:24] if it be a a foul person that wanted to
[3:27] cause some trouble he could really do it
[3:28] you go over that franchise because
[3:30] that's just like a copyright see the
[3:32] same thing you're not allowed to do it
[3:33] it's a great find to do that so if the
[3:36] people are making tapes perhaps they
[3:38] have an agreement from Mr Maguire who
[3:41] who has who draws royalties on the tapes
[3:44] and now and uh I don't know about that
[3:47] cuz I'm not here enough with you to know
[3:48] who these things are who it would be
[3:51] referring to I suppose that Mr Maguire
[3:53] still has it because out there in
[3:56] California or Arizona where I'm at I
[3:58] understand they're still buying tapes
[4:00] from the California uh brother sofman
[4:03] the father-in-law of Mr Maguire which is
[4:06] our brother here in the church uh I
[4:09] think that Mr Maguire still has the the
[4:12] franchise on now there has been
[4:15] complains all along on the making of the
[4:18] tape now when there is a complaint on
[4:21] anything pertaining to the finances of
[4:24] this church it's Duty bound to the
[4:27] trustees to see that thing is cleared
[4:31] there should not by any means be
[4:34] anything I see here it says on this card
[4:37] here that uh uh they're writing to the
[4:41] office and blaming you frankly I've had
[4:43] many letters on it and want to know why
[4:46] they can't get their tapes now you know
[4:49] your contract with the one who has the
[4:53] franchise As I understood the tapes I
[4:57] want nothing to do with them myself if
[5:00] anybody can use the tape for furthering
[5:02] the gospel amen but first brother robers
[5:07] and them started to make him brother
[5:08] beer and several of them started to make
[5:10] him and then the two boys brother Mercer
[5:13] and brother gold made him for years and
[5:16] of course when each one of the man has
[5:18] made him there has been complaints on
[5:20] everyone but it's seemingly here lately
[5:23] there's been a great complaint about not
[5:25] getting their Cas people called me up
[5:27] from across the country and then another
[5:29] being retract tapes they'll be playing
[5:32] one thing one minute and play back on
[5:33] another another thing and then you can't
[5:35] even understand what they are now these
[5:37] people paying for these tapes should get
[5:39] a genuine
[5:42] tape I don't care what they have to do
[5:45] to get it we want to see our customers
[5:48] and our brothers which they are our
[5:50] customers and our brothers so forth they
[5:53] must have a a number one tape now you
[5:56] truste see to that that these people are
[5:59] satisfied if not satisfied their money
[6:02] must be returned to them immediately and
[6:05] someone's called me and said they've
[6:06] been waiting for a months for tapes I
[6:09] don't know how brother Maguire tends to
[6:11] this I I don't know about that it's I
[6:13] know nothing about it I it's none of my
[6:15] business to know nothing about that's
[6:17] his business with them and the trustees
[6:18] now I'm not trying to step in but I just
[6:20] telling you what the law of it is see
[6:22] the law of it is that these tapes from
[6:26] the time that they send for them them
[6:28] tapes are supposed to be on their Road
[6:31] within a day or three or four five days
[6:33] after they send for them tapes it's got
[6:35] to be in the mail or the franchise could
[6:38] be cancelled at any time when these
[6:40] orders are disobeyed see now and every
[6:44] six months or a year this is supposed to
[6:47] be renewed this agreement is supposed to
[6:49] be renewed you're supposed to meet on
[6:51] this certain date that this franchise
[6:53] says that you got to meet and then it's
[6:56] supposed to be that's other people are
[6:58] supposed to come in at that time and
[6:59] you're supposed to notify others who
[7:01] have been asking about the tapes and
[7:03] come in with their agreement and sit
[7:05] down and talk it
[7:07] over now these orders must be carried
[7:10] out see and it must be carried right
[7:12] because it is complaining it complaining
[7:14] with Leo and Jean it complain with
[7:16] everyone is complaining with brother
[7:18] Maguire and he'll be complaining with
[7:19] somebody else but let's find out what
[7:20] the complaining is now but when the
[7:23] tapes are begin to pile up boxes of them
[7:27] Letters by the dozens pouring in and
[7:30] they see it doesn't fall back
[7:32] to the tape maker it falls on me they're
[7:37] always balling me out about it now it's
[7:40] my duty as a Christian to see that the
[7:42] people get what they pay for and I want
[7:45] you trustees to see if they get it if
[7:48] they have to charge more get a better
[7:49] tape get a better machine we want
[7:52] somebody to make that tape who makes it
[7:54] right that's our interest the tape must
[7:58] be made right
[8:00] and the customer must be satisfied or
[8:02] stop the whole tape thing all together
[8:04] we won't have no tapes just let anybody
[8:06] make them it wants to but if they're
[8:08] going to charge for them let them see
[8:11] that they get what they paid for because
[8:13] that's
[8:14] Christianity that's the more than do
[8:16] when they come here to listen to The
[8:17] Gospel I want to give them the best that
[8:19] I know how to give them see and when
[8:21] they come here I want to see that
[8:23] everybody and everything's carried on
[8:25] that's the reason I'm telling you
[8:26] deacons trustees and pastors here
[8:27] tonight that you must carry this out to
[8:30] the letter because the people are coming
[8:33] here to find God and we got to have
[8:36] these things in order and also the tapes
[8:39] must be put into the place if they have
[8:42] to charge more if they got second class
[8:44] tapes you're
[8:45] running then get better tapes if they
[8:48] have to charge more for them charge more
[8:49] for them let the person get what they
[8:51] charge for I'm not interested in one bit
[8:53] of royalty not one penny and neither's a
[8:56] tabernacle interested I don't want you
[8:58] to be don't Beed interested in that and
[9:00] in royalties if they pay something I
[9:02] guess you'd have to take a little
[9:04] royalty on account of it being major I
[9:06] think that's something they said Mr
[9:07] Miller and him about the law we had to
[9:09] take certain royalties or so forth
[9:10] that's up to you all to see to that I'm
[9:12] not have nothing to do with what that
[9:14] set together you all take care of that I
[9:16] can't take care of all of it I'm just
[9:17] telling you the way it should be and
[9:19] must be run
[9:21] that you understood I said must be run
[9:24] so um we want this run out right and if
[9:27] you have to have a better machine to
[9:29] take it then get a better
[9:31] machine if it has to be now I said to
[9:34] them I said every Mi mission that I go
[9:36] into the field before I go I'll notify
[9:40] you what sermons I'm going to preach on
[9:42] out there something that I've already I
[9:44] promised you all which I'm going to
[9:46] retake back again Sunday
[9:48] night that before I preach any new
[9:51] message it would come from this
[9:52] Tabernacle first because it seem to get
[9:54] a better recording you remember that
[9:55] then when I come here preach my messages
[9:57] then go back out and notify tape man
[10:00] what services they asked me what one
[10:02] what should go preach I on this night go
[10:03] so and so and this night so so so they
[10:05] can have it made up and ready for the
[10:07] customer to get it right there got it
[10:09] right with them a better tape than to
[10:11] have out in the meeting because it's
[10:13] made right here at the Tabernacle where
[10:14] the Acoustics are good okay now now
[10:18] going into this great Evangelistic what
[10:19] I'm going to do now overseas and things
[10:21] I can't promise that you see I can't
[10:23] promise I'll preach my first message
[10:24] here because when you preach a round of
[10:26] messages you got to have something is
[10:28] it's get St to you it's B to get stale
[10:31] to the ones that's listen at it you've
[10:32] got to do something different see and
[10:34] bring just as the message is there but
[10:37] let them put a machine in the field or
[10:38] whatever it is that'll take these tapes
[10:40] perfectly and make a perfect tape and
[10:42] each tape played back and check before
[10:44] it goes or just stop the whole thing
[10:46] don't even have to do let every man make
[10:47] his own tape see but get it done right
[10:50] see so this complaint will stop we don't
[10:53] want no complaints at all if there is a
[10:55] complaint let's take care of it and we
[10:57] have it over with now I'll hurry as
[11:00] quick as I can brother got by two more
[11:01] questions here three then we'll be
[11:04] finished how far brother Brenham can or
[11:07] should a deacon go to keep order in the
[11:10] church should we keep the order or wait
[11:14] until brother Neville tells us what we
[11:17] should do that isn't brother Neville's
[11:21] job that's your
[11:23] job you don't tell brother Neville what
[11:25] to preach on how to preach it see that's
[11:28] your job deacons you're supposed to do
[11:31] that you take care of that that's
[11:34] nothing to brother
[11:35] Neville that's your job see now uh if a
[11:39] policeman's out here on the street and
[11:40] he sees a man stealing a property out of
[11:43] the back of a car should he call the
[11:45] mayor and say now mayor your honor sir I
[11:47] am working for you here on this police
[11:49] force I find a man up the street here
[11:52] he's um uh he was stealing some tires
[11:55] off of a car last night I just wonder
[11:57] what's your opinion of that
[11:59] man that would be sensible would it ner
[12:03] if he's doing something wrong rest him
[12:05] and if a man's doing something wrong
[12:07] here in a church or anybody stop them
[12:09] talk to them don't be irant but if they
[12:13] won't listen speaking way that they know
[12:16] what you're saying see see like you tell
[12:18] a child say walk back around and he's
[12:20] misbehaving Deacon St at your place but
[12:22] the four of stay two in the front and
[12:24] two in the back on these corners or
[12:26] somewhere like that and watch real close
[12:27] for Renegades and everything else come
[12:30] in like this you see you be on the guard
[12:32] you get your posted Duty and stay there
[12:33] that's your seat or stand right Bes side
[12:35] of the wall and watch everybody come in
[12:38] a deacon takes care of the house of God
[12:39] someone come in speak to them be there
[12:41] to greet them shake their hand that
[12:43] you're the policeman uh could we show
[12:45] you the cloak room or would you be
[12:47] seated could we hand you a song book or
[12:49] something or now we would like for you
[12:52] to enjoy yourself here and and pray and
[12:55] and we are happy you're here with us
[12:57] tonight lead them right down to the
[12:58] place and say would you like to be
[13:00] closer would you like to be back here or
[13:02] wherever more that's Hospital a
[13:04] policeman or the Deacon is a military
[13:07] police to the Army courtesy but yet with
[13:11] authority see you know what a military
[13:14] police is is actually if he carries out
[13:17] his rights I think he's just like a
[13:18] chaplain you see it's courtesy and
[13:20] everything but yet he has an authority
[13:22] he must minding see he puts these
[13:25] rookies get out there and get drunk
[13:26] while he puts them in their place and so
[13:28] as a deacon to put them in place now
[13:30] remember the Deacon is a policeman and a
[13:32] Deacon's office is actually more strict
[13:34] than most any office in the church I
[13:37] don't know of an office any more
[13:38] stricter than the Deacon's office I try
[13:41] because he's got a he's got a real job
[13:43] and he's God's man he's God's man just
[13:46] as much as the pastor is God's man
[13:48] certainly he is he's God's servant now
[13:51] the trustees only thing they're under
[13:54] Duty by God to watch that finances and
[13:57] take care of that the things that goes
[13:58] on I told you about them tapes and and
[14:01] about other things here goes on about
[14:02] the building and repairs and keeping up
[14:04] the finances and things that's that's
[14:06] what they are Trustee of the property
[14:09] finances and things the deacons has
[14:11] nothing to do with that and neither the
[14:13] the trustee have anything to do with the
[14:14] deacons office now if the deacons wants
[14:17] to ask the trustees help on anything or
[14:19] the trustees the deacons and you're all
[14:21] working together but that's your Dy
[14:23] singling out all right now no don't ask
[14:27] brother Neville if brother Neville ask
[14:30] you to do something then that's that's
[14:32] your pastor with courtesy and love and
[14:34] everything he'd say uh brother Collins
[14:37] brother Hickerson brother Tony or
[14:39] somebody um would you see what's wrong
[14:41] back there in the corner at the post of
[14:43] Duty like that you know as a real man of
[14:45] God remember you are not working for
[14:48] brand Tabernacle neither are you working
[14:50] for brother Neville or me you're working
[14:53] for Jesus Christ see you that's who
[14:56] you're and he's he's respecting your
[14:58] loyalty just as same as is to that
[15:00] Pastor or to anybody else he's expecting
[15:03] your loyalty and we want to show our
[15:05] loyalty now sometimes it gets hard it's
[15:08] hard for me to see a minister sitting
[15:10] there I love with all my heart just have
[15:13] to really tell him see but in a way of
[15:16] love I've got a hand out to help him but
[15:19] see and they come to me and say brother
[15:20] Bram you're just a wonderful person why
[15:23] can't you just compromise a little on
[15:24] that baptism and on this that and the
[15:26] other that's Security in this referenc
[15:28] SE I say brother I love you but now
[15:32] let's just T take the scripture see
[15:34] who's right or wrong see I've got to be
[15:36] able to oh now brother BR I tell you
[15:37] you're all wrong see goes flying out oh
[15:40] I say well perhaps I am then if I am
[15:43] surely and you tell me you're you know
[15:45] where I'm wrong at then you show me
[15:46] where I'm wrong and I'm willing to take
[15:49] the same thing hey you ain't got no
[15:52] business telling that child is set down
[15:54] now the Deacon is a is a custodian at
[15:58] the house of God God see now if you he
[16:01] takes care of the house of God and keeps
[16:03] it in order that's what the scripture
[16:06] says if you got anything else the Deacon
[16:07] should do you come tell me see that's
[16:09] the same thing but that that's your duty
[16:11] to do that yeah just back up and should
[16:14] ask nobody that's that's just your duty
[16:15] brother Neville don't ask nobody the
[16:17] church don't have to ask I mean if the
[16:20] trustees don't have to go ask brother
[16:21] Neville if he wants the roof put on the
[16:24] Tabernacle no no that's not nothing to
[16:26] brother Neville not nothing to me that's
[16:29] to you the deacons don't have to is same
[16:32] way to the pastor why you go to preach
[16:33] on I don't want you to do this they
[16:35] ain't got no business saying that he's
[16:37] under God see the pastor and then if U
[16:41] if if brother Neville he preaches a
[16:44] message that the Lord has give us and
[16:46] we're all together in this and if I tell
[16:49] brother Neville something wrong god
[16:50] holds me responsible for it that's
[16:54] right so God is the boss of all of it
[16:57] see and we're just working if his
[16:59] ambassadors you see down here in these
[17:01] office please next question and then I
[17:03] think we got one more and then we we'll
[17:06] stop please explain just how the gifts
[17:10] of tongues are to operate in our church
[17:13] I have did that when can the church be
[17:17] put in order as are just where the gifts
[17:23] are to operate we've just explained that
[17:26] just how many C h r i s t m
[17:31] a um could you see what they is
[17:36] instruments oh instruments um how many
[17:40] instruments are we to uh have in church
[17:45] besides organ and
[17:48] Pian well depends on if you had a String
[17:51] Band or whatever you had you see I don't
[17:53] know what you got what this means I
[17:55] don't understand it but the organ and
[17:59] the piano are property of the church now
[18:03] if the song leader would take an ocean
[18:06] to have a trumpets and carnets and so
[18:09] forth like that and somebody's coming to
[18:11] church and they play these instruments
[18:13] and they're in a band and and then of
[18:15] course then that's for your trustees to
[18:17] take it up with the trustees and see if
[18:19] they got money to buy their instruments
[18:20] and so forth or whatever like that I
[18:22] guess that's what the question is but if
[18:25] they have their own instruments
[18:26] wonderful if they don't have their own
[18:27] instruments and they're member here of a
[18:30] band not just the person runs in here
[18:32] and plays once in a while and runs out
[18:33] like that it's got to be a band in the
[18:36] church the church wouldn't buy uh a
[18:39] trumpet for a man that plays it year and
[18:41] tomorrow night somewhere else and
[18:42] somewhere else and drop in once in a
[18:44] while play a little bit no sir it's got
[18:46] to be a band right here organized band
[18:48] with the the leader then the church talk
[18:51] to them about buying
[18:53] instruments please explain just how we
[18:57] are to
[19:01] how we deacons can keep the people
[19:07] uh just in the sanctuary before or
[19:12] please keep the people quiet in before
[19:16] after church all right I would suggest
[19:18] this
[19:19] Brethren now there is a great thing wish
[19:22] we had more time to put on it or it's
[19:24] it's it it means something
[19:27] just now the church is not a if he wants
[19:33] to if you want to run this tape down
[19:35] some night and play it before the
[19:36] meetings that the people understand it
[19:38] let this be played this this part of the
[19:41] tape of no more this this any part of
[19:43] this that you want to play for a certain
[19:44] thing just keep running till you find it
[19:46] and then play it see because it's
[19:48] question
[19:49] now deacons of the
[19:53] church and as as I said are the police
[19:56] of the church but the church church is
[19:59] not a general Meetinghouse for for
[20:03] fellowship and friendship and
[20:05] frolic the church is a sanctuary of God
[20:10] we come here now if we want to meet one
[20:13] another let me come to your house you
[20:15] come to my house you go to one another's
[20:17] house and meet one but just to frolic
[20:19] around through the church and talking
[20:20] and things like that it's not right
[20:23] brethren we come here we get the whole
[20:25] thing off of our mind if we would come
[20:28] here look way we used to do it years ago
[20:30] sister dirty was a
[20:32] Pianist when I pastored here I would I
[20:34] had to be Pastor Deacon trustee
[20:37] everything else at once see but I I had
[20:39] to do it now you don't have to do it
[20:40] that way see because you got man to
[20:43] carry this out but when the I had ushers
[20:46] brother seart and all of them at the
[20:48] door they had books piled around there
[20:50] at the door sitting in a chair or
[20:52] something there when someone come in you
[20:54] show them a place to hang your coat or
[20:56] help them to their seat give them a song
[20:58] book
[20:59] and asked them to be in prayer and then
[21:03] everybody sat in their seat and silently
[21:06] prayed until starting time see and then
[21:10] at starting time sister Gertie The
[21:12] Pianist got up there and started the
[21:14] music before when the people were coming
[21:17] together I would suggest to have your
[21:20] organist to get up there with some real
[21:23] nice music if she can't be here put it
[21:25] on tape and then play it or something
[21:27] and have music music real sweet Sacred
[21:30] Music going on so and ask people and if
[21:34] people goes to uh uh talking and car
[21:37] like that let one of the deacons get up
[21:39] at the microphone up there at the desk
[21:41] and say
[21:42] sh like okay
[21:45] say at the Tabernacle here we we want
[21:49] you to come to worship let's not make
[21:51] noise now listen to the music get your
[21:53] seat sit down be Reverend see pray or
[21:58] read the Bible this in the sanctuary
[22:01] here is where the Lord dwells and we
[22:04] want everybody to be real reverend in
[22:06] worship not to be running around talking
[22:09] before the services congregate
[22:12] yourself and you come here to talk to
[22:16] the Lord see either be in silent prayer
[22:20] see or read your Bible when I went into
[22:23] the Marvel Church up there at the Norman
[22:26] Vincent Peele you've heard of it and I
[22:29] went into great psychology teacher you
[22:31] know and I went into his church I just
[22:33] thought I wish my Tabernacle do that
[22:35] again and Deacon stand right there at
[22:37] the door just soon as you come in they
[22:39] of course they hand you a Sunday school
[22:40] slip taking you right down he had to
[22:42] empty three times you only hold about 4
[22:44] 500 you know New York's a big place and
[22:46] he's a popular man I think they had to
[22:49] have one class at 10:00 and one at 11:
[22:52] same seron not over again same service
[22:54] exactly same sheet of paper but when
[22:56] they dismissed and they had a 5 minutes
[22:59] for the church to be exactly nobody else
[23:01] could come in until they got out and the
[23:02] deacons opened the way and the church
[23:04] filled up they had these old box seats
[23:06] you know they go in like that and sit
[23:07] down in the Pew where you open the door
[23:09] old fashioned it's been standing there
[23:10] for around 200 years I guess the old
[23:12] Marvel church had and you could have
[23:15] heard a pin drop anywhere in that church
[23:17] and everybody in prayer or at least 30
[23:21] minutes before the first note was ever
[23:24] hit on the Argon the
[23:27] prud and just everybody in prayer I
[23:29] thought how wonderful it is now when I
[23:32] Minister that plude about I think it
[23:34] played one plude for about 3 to five
[23:37] minutes How Great Thou Art or something
[23:39] like that like that and then when they
[23:41] did everybody stopped praying and listen
[23:43] to the pr it give a change from prayer
[23:45] to the peute and then when they played
[23:48] that then the quar leader directed The
[23:51] quar then they had a congregational song
[23:53] in the choir and then they were ready
[23:56] for their Sunday school class see and
[23:58] then um and then when it was over there
[24:00] was nothing went on except Divine
[24:03] worship all the time that's what we come
[24:05] there for and I think it would be a good
[24:07] thing if our church and I'm just saying
[24:10] this we would do it see let's do it if
[24:14] somebody does anything is I think it' be
[24:16] a good thing if it's a good thing then
[24:17] let's do it see we don't want to put off
[24:20] any good thing we'll do it anyhow see
[24:23] and just go ahead and and stand up there
[24:25] and and if they start on a morning or
[24:27] something like that people busy just let
[24:29] someone one the deacons or somebody walk
[24:31] up there and say uh it's been made a
[24:34] rule in the Tabernacle here I don't know
[24:36] what they do they may may I'm never here
[24:38] you see I don't know I'm never here
[24:39] before services and when they come in
[24:42] and they start talking that somebody got
[24:44] and they sh just a moment see let let
[24:47] give the sister get her up there and get
[24:49] her playing that music if you don't put
[24:50] it on tape and get it out there see of
[24:52] the organ music and say now we there's a
[24:55] new rule in the Tabernacle when people
[24:57] enter here we're not the whisper talk
[24:59] but to worship now just a few minutes
[25:02] the service will be starting until then
[25:04] just either read your Bible or bow your
[25:06] head and silently pray a few times like
[25:09] that they'll all learn see see you hear
[25:12] somebody talking then it gets down for
[25:14] after a few times like that after while
[25:16] you hit a place where somebody say see
[25:18] somebody talking nobody else talking see
[25:21] well then one of the deacons walk up and
[25:22] say we uh we want you to worship dur
[25:26] time of the service you
