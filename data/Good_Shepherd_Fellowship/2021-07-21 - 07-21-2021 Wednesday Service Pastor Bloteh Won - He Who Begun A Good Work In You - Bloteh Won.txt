bit different uh that i would not go astray uh philippians chapter one let's let's just read that tonight i thought about it during the week and uh and then uh brother freda's wife also sent us a greeting to the church wishing us happy happy birthday good shepherd so we want to thank the lord for that amen let's let's read philippians 1 philippians chapter 1. paul and timothy us the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons grace unto you in peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i thank my god upon every remembrance of you praise the lord always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now you know when we talk about a church anniversary and i'm reading these words they're becoming very personal to me and in my relationship with with this assembly being confident of this very thing that he wish have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ amen let's read that verse 6 again and can we all read it together being confident of this very thing that he wish had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ let's pray father we just want to ask lord the blessings of what we have just read lord god we don't want theory we want the person of the world and the very person of this world is you yourself lord we know that these are your blessed promises so we ask so father come lord and bless us together tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed and uh i wish i was i was you know i was fully caught into the inspiration of doing something uh this weekend uh as a church anniversary because it would have just it would have just worked so well it would have just worked so well two wednesdays ago after the service uh uh i think i was on my way home or maybe the the next day uh uh one of the sister sister evie called me on the phone and you know and and we were commenting a little bit about the service and we were just fellowshipping and she says well brother juan do you you realize that uh uh today or the uh yesterday which was we were talking on thursday and it was yesterday she said you realize that it was it was the the 7th of july which means 7-7 i say i thought about it but i did not want to make anything out of it because uh you know i'm i'm just i don't know it's just my nature i just don't like making things trying to create things you know but what what came to my mind actually that i have a good friend over in ghana and we did his wedding on the 7th of july uh uh some years back so most of the time i do think about him but then i thought about it that day i says oh yeah this is the seven of july this is this is july 7 21 you know so it's almost like a 7-7 but then i realized that the following wednesday also turned out to be the 14th which was seven seven and seven seven seven and today it turned to be the 21 777 so then i said to myself it looks like i can get out of this you know i'm trying not to say anything but it keeps provoking me so i i will have to say something about it but i would just show i would just hear something a little bit genesis chapter one genesis chapter one uh you know seven is a very uh unique numbers like like every other number in the bible and uh but you will you will realize these few days i've been going over some few things and if the lord help us we try to share it to you and the reason why i've been reviewing those things is because we are living in such an age and time where uh there are a lot of people that are trying to rise up and and and you know and and discourage us like i was trying to speak on sunday and never really got down to to where my inspiration was but talking about you know uh uh people you know christians in this age being uh bewitched you know uh we we are turning uh into formalities we are running after different things instead of running after the principal thing which is god himself and uh uh uh so you know um a couple of years ago uh uh the roman church came out with an article i might print their article open and and show it to you if i can get my hands on it before sunday and it came out with an article and that says that you cannot really trust the bible you cannot trust the bible because there are a lot of uh uh you know a lot of um inaccuracies as they think but so it caught my attention and i've been trying to look into uh some some few studies to to bring out uh you know and and try to show to you how this bible is the most accurate amen is most the most accurate literature you have ever have in the universe of man and if the lord helped me i would try to to bring it to you we if we can get to it on sunday i will i'll try to i will try to get to it and if you realize in uh in in in recent time i've been i've been making emphasis on that and been trying to encourage you most especially my young people and because you know uh you you will never be able to appreciate you know the message of the hour until you appreciate the bible you know you will never understand the message of the hour until you understand the bible you know until the grace of god help you you know sometimes it looks like you know people says you will not understand the bible don't tell you understand the message no it is i think it's the other way around you know you'll be able to appreciate the message that god has sent to us when you really get in the bible because just like i've said to you before uh god is with with the jews uh in inner party just like he showed to moses he said build a tabernacle according to the pattern that i show you in heaven now for us as gentiles he deals with us as types what has already happened he he show us it back and says what is happening now look back in the old testament you have a typed in that's right you know but it's because man has always tried you know to make to make the word of god fade into the understanding of fit into their theory and and because it's not fitting that is the reason why let me just show you some few things the very first sentence in the bible genesis chapter 1 genesis chapter 1 verse 1 praise the lord i tried to get a little uh hebrew version of faith uh genesis chapter one verse one if uh if uh the sisters can help us import that uh little hebrew phrase on a day which of course is genesis is is genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the hebrew in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now in the in the in in the hebrew turks you realize that that just the first verse in the bible is uh seven words seven words i tried to to uh uh see if i could uh uh try to speak it in hebrew but no my tongue can't get there so i i won't try tonight because i don't want i don't want to blaspheme from the altar praise the lord and then if you if you look closely uh you'll realize that we read from the left to the right but in the hebrew degree from the right to the left is because all language meets at jerusalem all language meets at jerusalem those that read you'll realize that there's one group of people that read from the left to the right they are on one side of israel and then on the other side of israel all the nations from there read from the right to the left you can go and check it out you'll realize that now and then if you look at this you will realize that there are seven words in the first verse of the torah that would be what the that will be how it is in the torah and if you count the letters the hebrew letters this is 28 letters 28 letters with some of mine uh uh study that i was looking at as a look at this and and you you realize that so if you if you look closely you will see that uh the first three hebrew words translated that translate in the beginning god created has 14 letters the last four words heaven and earth also have 14 letters and i was looking at this as as i was studying it you you see a bunch of seven keep repeating right in the first chapter god created the heaven and the earth and all of his creation in six days and then on the seventh day he rested amen praise the lord so you see all of these you know just keep repeating it is so so so so amazing it is it is so amazing when you when you just look into it and and most of these things that that are that are coming out they are done by even uh they are they are scientists researchers that are trying to look into the accuracy of the bible and the more they look into it the more they realize that this was the design of god himself praise the lord it was god himself that designed it and and the and the amazing thing about it is that uh uh when you when you look at it close i mean there are just a lot of things i could it would take me all a lot of time to just to just show and what would make us or make us do not really appreciate this is because we have an english bible that came from a hebrew text praise the lord that's that will that's that's the thing that will that will uh uh you know it would trick us a little bit let me see that way sure but if you can look into the hebrew text as as we are saying this then you will start to appreciate it praise the lord i was going to i was going to show uh oh let me leave that let me leave that it might it would take me into something else let me just leave it but there's you know that is i mean it's it's just amazing it's it's amazing my i mean you know my mind is blown when i just think about the intelligence that is behind their intelligence praise the lord amen the bible says in genesis chapter 1 verse 11 it says let every sea bring forth of its kind amen let every seed bring forth of its kind why you think that the the hearse or the dog or any animal reproduce itself now it's so easy to say that the word of god say every seed must bring forth of his kind praise the lord but you see there is an intelligence that is behind that word that has a dna called it has a design praise the lord and that was that was one of the place where signs raise their hands even though they they don't want to come to full surrounding to believe that there's a great intelligence behind the creation they still want to hold to all their turing but when it comes to the to the dna code it shows the intelligence that only one man can have one being and that's almighty god praise the lord and design that makes you in in a sense together if a man will have five children or how many children he will have uh uh the intelligence of god designed it in a way that all the children would be unique they would be unique they will have uh uh uh you know some unique things of themselves but yet they will have something in common that makes them to resemble and it was it is it is god himself that wrote that dna called amen praise the lord so that as i said we will look we will look into more we will look into more of there because if there is ever a time where we must we must anchor in the word of god it's this time praise the lord ever a time where we must anchor in the word of god i ain't got our faith because that's the only resting place you know that faith can rest is upon the word of god because because we will have troubling times troubling waters there are things that will happen you know that the only place you can turn to is the word of god thank you lord thank you praise the lord now there will be there will be nothing around you to bring you hope or comfort great intelligence great great great intelligence the first sentence in the torah in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth seven words 28 letters and it can just roll on and roll on and roll on and roll on but uh uh and and and it is just god in simplicity that is just showing that my word is perfect because the number seven is perfection god first sentence that was that is reading is saying my word is perfect you can trust it amen well let's go to our our text tonight that we want to we want to speak on tonight i want i just want to take what paul says that in in in philippians chapter one he will have began a good work in you i just want to encourage us tonight as a church every one of us he will have began a good work in you he will have began a good work in you you have to identify the one that have began a work in you if there's a work in you you have to identify he will have began a good work in you it's so amazing it's so amazing i pray that the lord will just add the blessing to his word amen and uh so let's let's just go back to that text again like i said i feel uh a bit uh uh you know personal when i read that and uh like paul says here i will start there from uh verse two grace unto you and peace from god now it's it's very amazing here you'll realize that paul used his greeting all the time grace and peace grace and peace because actually is grace that brings peace is the grace of god that brings peace and then in another sense is is is is greetings to two group of people grace to the gentiles peace actually the root word that is shalom we know that grace and peace from god and from the lord jesus i thank my god upon every remembrance of you praise the lord to know that god has given us a body like paul says in ephesians a body that is fitly joined together praise the lord you see this body that we have it is so easy for us to we all learn to identify you know the members of our body and the only ones that we identify and we all know is the visible ones that we can see yes but there are other parts of our body that are so important think about the heart think about your lungs think about your kidney think about your intestine think about your brain you know and uh uh and to just think about how god puts this body together how he put this body together and the body that you that we have here and we enjoy and we love if you don't love yours i don't know what's wrong with you that we love starts from a seed it starts from a seed and that is the same way this body this mystical body started from a seed the thing that have drawn us here together tonight is not nationality is the seed incorruptible that is the word of god think about it now and you just think about what paul says i thank my god upon every remembrance of you if you think you just go back in your mind and you travel a little bit and you think about all the places you have gone or the things you have done you go back 10 years from now i mean uh some of you knew one another those that were here in this local church you knew one another but you can even push it back to the time where you never knew one another you can push it as far back when you never knew not a brother in this assembly not a sister in this assembly i would even say push it back when you never even knew your wife and he never even knew how many children you have you never even thought of what name you would give them if you just push it back and you just travel in your mind a little bit to see how by design we all sit here tonight from a seed sure that was in the mind of god from a seed thought that was in the mind of god paul says always in every prayer of mine i remember you in every prayer of mine for for you all making requests with joy i'm making requests upon you for our fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now i remember the first day i walked through this through these doors of this church brother joe falling was preaching and uh i know i just just throw in and and without no introduction came in and just sat down praise the lord and virgil funny was preaching and i remember exactly the moment i was sitting right there and then he was saying something about a good friend brother something tail you want to be with the lord you know he was talking something about ghana and he mentioned brother sampson ted and he looked in my direction he said you know brother samson i said yes i know him it looks like i know you you know and then the service just went different you know because we started talking personal things when he's supposed to be preaching you know yeah but the fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now our fellowship has been in the gospel from the first day until now praise the lord and i will say let our fellowship continue in the gospel from now on to the coming of the lord let it not go into tradition let it not go into nationality letting that go into nothing but let it continue in the gospel of jesus christ to the coming of the lord amen and this is what i want to bring us to being confident and i'll say it i would say in my mind you know when i when i look back you know i sat there you know and and brother joe preach and then you know things went on but i i could see one one one quality that i could see there is there with everything that was happening at the time you know uh uh one thing i saw i saw the the love that the people have for the world no matter how the world was coming whether we were playing tip whether we were watching video whatever it was there was just a love for the world that was something that i was attracted to and most especially the young people at that time sister annette's sister catherine back there the lord and sister of faith and uh uh adam and you know yeah the few of them i just just i just in my you know i just sat down i just trying to be innocent but i was just observing but i was attracted to that and paul says here he says being confident being comforting and that's what i want to do tonight if the lord can help me i don't know if i can do it i trust the lord to be able to do it is to bring us to this place where we have to be confident of the one that has begin the work in you praise the lord we have to be confident of the one that have began the work in you he began the work when you are not even there just like i said it was a seed in his mind praise the lord amen i mean for you to be able to for you to be able to get away from god you have to go back to that thought yes right and you have to make god to forget about his thought that he thought of you right and that's why that jeremiah said i know the thought that i've taught of you and when he thought of you you were not even there right praise the lord so you can't get away from me i don't care how how you try the only thing you will be doing you will just be building a lot of regret for yourself the better thing that any any loving person that love themself can do is to just surround them [Music] you make it a lot easier [Music] when you surrender [Applause] being confident in this very thing that he wish begin he didn't say begin the work begin a good work from the very beginning it was a good work and because it was a good work from the beginning they have to finish as a good work genesis chapter one from the first day the bible says he said it was good the second day it was good the third day it was good the fourth day it was good the fifth day it was good the sixth day it was very good so when almighty god begins a world he begins a good [Applause] [Music] [Applause] word when god begins at work he begins a good work yes sir are you feeling good oh you just got to feel good you just got to feel good praise the lord amen i won't have to wait for you to make me feel good i feel good because he started a good work i don't have to wait for the music to feel good i feel good because he started a good amen praise the lord amen amen he wish began a good work in you amen amen are we together [Laughter] oh i just love the lord amen amen i was meditating on something in and i just thought i said lord i'm just going to leave that and i just trust you tonight and pick up the word to be able to encourage your people praise the lord being confident of this very thing being confident there is i mean man will fail us the system will fill us praise the lord but if this can be your confidence if you can rest the rest of your life upon this the heat that begin a good work in you praise the lord he begin a good work and paul says he will perform it amen a carried the sense of continuous good work that's the reason why for for a child of god it can only get better it can only get better it has one way to go and is to get better from glory unto glory unto glory unto glory praise the lord amen because every time he put us through a triad is to just bring us out much brighter than we were before [Music] it's just to beat the draws out of our life so we can shine more brighter than we ever shine before so for the child of god everything like paul said for all things work for good that's right to them that love the lord amen thank you jesus okay to begin a good work in you and that's the way i feel about it praise the lord i feel that he that have began a good work on the corner of this street sister 900 humboldt avenue praise the lord he that have began a good work unless it's the work of man is going to fail amen that's the reason why we we do everything to put our shoulder and lift up the preeminence of jesus christ we gotta praise him we got to lift the name of jesus christ up because he said if i be lifted up that's right i will draw you every time we break we lift the name of jesus up he brings us up praise the lord amen he that have began a good work in you will perform it he will perform it over and over you see that you see that word in the old testament let me let me just show you a little bit of what i'm talking about here praise the lord you find that over and over in the in the prophecy of of our lord jesus christ oh praise the lord amen now if you look over especially you look over in the book of isaiah that would be one of the the the commonplace amen isaiah chapter nine when when the uh when the word uh you know as i prophesied about a virgin shall conceive verse 7 it says and and of the increase of his government and the peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with joshua and with justice and from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this that word or that phrase has the expression like brother branham said god will rob the bank of heaven he will rob heaven just so his word will not fail the view of the lord will perform it god will put all of his might behind his promise to bring it to pass praise the lord amen and and and over and over through the scripture you can you can go home and just and put it up and on your search and see that over and over how many times it's expressed in the scripture but here paul is using that same sense of word here to say that he that began the good work in you he began it he's not going to leave it over to the hands of infinite man praise the lord he's not going to leave it over to the hands of uh uh not even the hands of angels but he that have began that work yes will perform it what he have began what he saw in his mind he's going to perform it he's going to he's going to realize it he's going to bring it to fulfill me just like when he started creation in genesis and he says let there be light it is a world i mean angels now i have created a lie you go and do the rest no right praise the lord what he started he went on six days he got himself a perfect eating created everything what he started what he began he performed so he they have began a good work in you praise the lord he will perform it until the day of our lord jesus praise the lord that's the god that we serve amen and when you look back in the beginning when god started his work over in revelation the bible talks about the beginning of the creation of god when god begins anything he begins it with his word when god begins anything he begin it with his word god do not start anything without his word praise the lord because the only thing that has the power to produce itself it's the word of god praise the lord that's the reason why don't stand you know what i you know you know my brother you know was talking to me one time being away from church and and then you call me up and says you know what you know bruanna you know i i need to find a church in this area and you know and he was talking to me i told him i said brother that's a good thing that's a good thing i can give you contact and you know and contact you with the brothers dead and all of that but let me advise you let me advise you my advice would be start with the word what you need is not church you don't need church sure i said you think about it how long you been in the church and you still went astray amen what you need now is you must start with the word let that word become a person to you when the word become person to you no matter where the word is you will go there if it is three hours you will drive if i show you a church and you go there after one week and you realize that is one hour drive brother that place too far that a complaint you will get because it's church you are going to but if you have come in contact with the world if even six hours away you would go there because the world has become a person to you amen if you want to start start with the word praise the lord when god starts anything for the great unimportant god the great internal spirit to even begin time he had to condense himself to a body called the logos which was the word in the beginning the first form of god was the word that's the reason why when you know god by the word when you know god by his word there is no doctrine no seducing spirit there is no false teaching that can bewitch you from this glorious truth because you're now only listening to cults you have met the man that wears the court praise the lord amen god begins with his word so when god began a good work in you he was not chasing your physical body or your earthly structure he was planting that word trying to plant that word in your heart trying to blame that word trying to to to cultivate your life of all of the genetic struggle and dysfunction so that word can start to produce itself because when god started work he start with his word because god is attracted to his word god is obligated to his word that's why he will protect you because his word is there that's why he gave his injuries charged over you because his word is there actually it's his word that he's protecting amen it's not your physical body god is protecting his word he's watching over his word he's obligated to his word praise the lord you know when we read that scripture over and over when god when abraham took isaac on the mountain and isaac asks his dad lord the altar is ready where is the sacrifice most of the time we read it in it and we read god will provide but read it again god will provide for himself that's right god will provide for himself when he's called jehovah jarrah is not to provide for you is to provide for himself praise the lord god provide for himself in your life that's why he don't give you everything you ask for right because he's not providing for you he's providing for himself right praise the lord but what are we talking about tonight let's just look at a few scriptures and then i will read a quote or two here are we together you love the lord praise the lord we realize that paul carried this thought throughout in ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 he says for we are his workmanship we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works amen which god has before ordained that we should walk in so everything that he's doing with our life is to produce a good work praise the lord at the end of the day is going to turn out good and beautiful amen we are his workmanship amen created in christ jesus unto good work which god has already ordained and then when when he saw that see taught about you it was for you to come in bring good fruits amen here begin a good work second corinthians chapter nine verse eight paul also says he is and god is able to make all grace abound towards you thy yet always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work to every good work just like i said a a a genesis 1 principle must always keep that in our mind genesis 1 principle from the day that he started when he came to the end it was good that's right amen it was good now god is almighty all powerful why i mean you could have just created everything you are just you just speak a word and everything will have just been created one day everything is done but you see it all goes back to that same pattern principle god had to take day and the next day and the next day why because he's showing us a principle he's showing us a pattern god in in his principle he does not have uh uh uh you know a quick face one day magic got no no he works he works by parting by principle i mean it will have just been easy put the seed to the ground the next day the tree just grow no but there is there is a pattern there is a principle and every step and every stage of our life he has to bring a good product at the end right then he moved us to the next stage of our life sometimes it's hard for us to see it why because we are workmanship he we are the one that he's working on you are not sitting there and god is working and you are looking no you are the one that he's working on so sometimes it's hard for you to see the good that is coming out of it because you are the one that he's working on praise the lord collusion chapter 1 verse 10 paul says that yeah my work wealthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god so his very taught about us was to walk in good work praise the lord amen he has began there's good work in you he will perform it till the end let me share this with you and then we pray what is the holy ghost giving for we have we have been since adam god the father was over moses and the children of israel in the pillar of fire then god with us in christ walking with us talk with us eat with us slept with us god over us god with us and now is god in us praise the lord now is god in us that's what the holy ghost is it's god in us and we must learn to appreciate it you know the church word has has has you know make us to think that sometimes we are the ones that are that are working out our ways you know working you know working our salvation even when you read that scripture where paul says you know uh uh you know work out your salvation with fear and trembling at the end of the statement he says it is christ that worketh in you amen and that is the reason why you know uh uh god has called us to partnership redemption is is a work of partnership he has called us to partnership that's the reason why all the time i say is when god shows something in your life that seems to be like a flaw and all seems to be like something you don't like it's not to embarrass you he wants to work with you because that's the only way he can call you an overcomer if he do it you are not an overcomer praise the lord amen he shows you he said here is that deal with it and he's he's right there with you he's not leaving you no no he's right there with you and you can just enjoy how the grace of god is helping you to overcome that thing this walk with god i'm telling you when eno walk with god he enjoys it when he walk with god he enjoys it praise the lord let's walk with god we must enjoy the holy ghost we must enjoy god dealing with our lives so is god in us all god was come into christ all christ was come into the church what is it god working in you any word in the word if he did want to call on you you are right there david said where can we go and hide from the lord that's right in a word if he wants to call on you you are right there working in you to do his good will how we ought to thank god for that how we ought to thank god for that god working in us to do his good will that's the reason why prayer must never be a burden david said i was glad when he said let's go to the house of the lord he said i was glad praise the lord even though we are living in a time where the culture the society is trying to to to detects to the young people and says wow this is this is the old-fashioned way you know you you you have to follow your heart you have to follow your and and you know the reality there is the other we all realize i mean all of these people that are saying that when it comes to that time when it comes to that moment in their life what about illness what a what a close to death moment when they come from out of there they realize the supernatural being some way that if it was not for god that's right they realize that there is a super even though they don't want to admit it but it's they realize there is a god that was intelligence this word is governed praise the lord so we ought to be thankful we ought to be thankful young people you ought to be thankful that god has started dealing with you in in your youthful age praise the lord a lot of the things that you might escape if you hold on to this confession so young people think you have to go in and lay foolish in the world for you to experience god god's grace god love you you will still experience it but as a human one thing you can do is forget when those flashbacks come back to your mind how we ought to thank god for that god the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of god living in his church moving through each age working out his divine will god working out his divine will are we together ever pressing water today we got the word we follow the word and we see the word working in the believer and we know we know it's so then god working in us confirming the word with signs and wonders we stay with the word the word produce the result we don't have to make makeup things we don't have to make up things we don't have to make up things we don't have to make up spiritual dreams we don't have to make a spiritual gift all we have to do stay with the world yes all we have to do stay with the word the word will produce the result the word will produce the result he who begin this good work in you amen praise the lord musicians you can come tonight or what i
