[0:00] [Music]

[0:44] prayer our Lord in Our Saviour Jesus we

[1:12] us now wherever we gather you would come
[1:18] down dear Lord Jesus and honor yourself
[1:21] in our midst and further once again we
[1:24] have gathered together and we know
[1:26] without any shadow of doubt that you
[1:29] keep your word we pray the Father for
[1:33] all that I have done for us we worship
[1:35] the Lord Jesus we bless thee and will
[1:38] glorify the old God that we can go to
[1:42] bed and rise up onto our feet in a very
[1:46] strong physical and mental condition and
[1:48] come to your house dear Lord Jesus to
[1:51] give you praise and honor we thank you
[1:55] for everything you've done for us and we
[1:59] are trusting you father this morning
[2:00] that you speak to us during the course
[2:03] of this Sunday School and further as you
[2:07] are getting to the end of this topic we
[2:09] prayed about a time we bring this topic
[2:12] the Catchings down on this topic you
[2:15] will have open our eyes to see things we
[2:20] may never have seen before all things we
[2:23] knew but overlooked and do it as our
[2:28] faith leaders granted on to us father we
[2:31] pray this morning
[2:32] in Jesus name Amen
[2:37] so
[2:58] so we are still looking at our our topic
[3:03] on Titan and we are going to look at the
[3:11] reason why the actual reason why I
[3:14] decided to I deserve for us to look at
[3:21] this topic together there is a lot of
[3:30] blessings in pay entites
[3:34] people have been very very faithful in a
[3:39] way in the Atty pain but they have never
[3:42] seen God move it is not because they are
[3:49] not faithful in their tight pain it's
[3:52] not because they are not dream why do
[3:54] you support what you are supposed to do
[3:59] but is a little step a lot of us
[4:05] including myself overlooked and that
[4:09] hinder the entire blessing and that is
[4:14] why I believe God ladies on my heart for
[4:19] us to look at it together it's not to
[4:23] say that everything we've looked at
[4:26] before wasn't important everything we
[4:29] have talked about as a matter of fact
[4:31] was very important and very dear to this
[4:34] topic but I believe with all my heart
[4:38] that this is what holds the secret today
[4:42] and hold fast to it before I zero in on
[4:51] it
[4:52] brotherbrother said in the message that
[4:58] prophet speaking God been misunderstood
[5:02] 1961 he said
[5:05] I would like to give you I'm wearing a
[5:08] different glasses today the other one
[5:10] broke last week this is disturbing my
[5:13] eyes I would like to give you a little
[5:18] testimony of how that I was even hungry
[5:22] and my mother and them hungry and my dad
[5:28] is sick but I took my tights out first
[5:32] and give it a good and you ought to see
[5:36] what happened I have never seen in life
[5:41] that any man woman that if that you make
[5:48] $1 a week bring the 10 cents of that
[5:52] money and put it into your storehouse
[5:55] and a church where you come if God don't
[6:00] bless that call me a hypocrite that is a
[6:03] very hard statement for the prophet of
[6:06] God to make the statement yes a that's a
[6:09] challenge to anybody every Christian
[6:12] should pay tithe
[6:14] now as I started in my intro I said you
[6:19] can pay tithe all your life and still
[6:23] miss out on the blessing the Bible says
[6:27] in Luke 12 31 and then Matthew 6:33
[6:36] let's just take that let's take Matthew
[6:41] 6:33
[6:56] alright 6:33 but seek ye first the
[7:03] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[7:07] all these things shall be added unto you
[7:11] seek ye first the kingdom of God I
[7:15] always try to seek the interests of God
[7:20] above your personal interests the Bible
[7:24] says that we should give God the
[7:28] preeminence in our life always put God
[7:36] first when you put God first God puts
[7:40] you first and when you put God second
[7:44] you may think God put you second no he
[7:46] puts you las give God the preeminence
[7:57] now as I said I just love this portion I
[8:05] think I just love this portion of the
[8:08] whole subject more than any other part
[8:15] first Kings 17 first Kings 17
[8:29] I read from ten I have it all the way to
[8:36] 24 but I'll just end at 1417 first Kings
[8:42] 10 so he rose and went to Zarephath
[8:49] and when he came to the gate of the city
[8:52] behold a widowed woman was there dead
[8:55] rain of sticks and he called to her and
[9:01] said fetch me I pretty a little water in
[9:07] a vessel that I may drink and as she was
[9:12] going to fetch it he called to her and
[9:16] said bring me I pretty
[9:19] a muzzle of bread in thine hand and she
[9:24] said as the Lord thy God liveth I have
[9:27] not a kick but a handful of meal in a
[9:32] barrel and a little oil in a cruise and
[9:36] behold I am gathering two sticks that I
[9:41] will go in and rest it for me and my son
[9:45] that we may eat who may eat it and I
[9:52] praise be to God
[9:54] this was Elijah when he said that
[10:01] wouldn't be rain or Dew till he called
[10:05] for it for three and a half years there
[10:08] was drought on the land there was no
[10:11] ring we all know the story how he was
[10:14] had a brook and a brook dried up I don't
[10:19] have much time I don't want to go into
[10:21] it but then God directed him to go to
[10:25] the riff-off and that he had commanded a
[10:29] widow woman to take care of him and then
[10:33] Elijah goes to Zarephath and then he
[10:35] sees this woman gathering sticks to go
[10:38] and prepare food for her and her son
[10:41] that they may eat and I
[10:43] and Aleya to the woman that got me some
[10:47] water to drink remember this was a time
[10:51] of drought where I was very scarce it
[10:59] just sends me down memory lane a lot of
[11:02] stories no time
[11:04] praise Beauty God and then as she was
[11:09] going to get him the water to drink then
[11:12] he says no just water alone but when you
[11:16] are coming just get me a muzzle of bread
[11:19] something to eat and that was very very
[11:23] hard not only was he asking for water to
[11:26] drink but also food and the food she had
[11:29] was the last bit of it and to tell you
[11:34] how small it was
[11:35] the Bible says she was gathering just
[11:37] two sticks to go and prepare cake for
[11:40] her and for her son that they may eat
[11:42] and I that tells you how small the food
[11:44] was then a prophet of God says you know
[11:47] what not just a portion of it not after
[11:51] you and your son have eaten but you know
[11:53] what bring me the first portion the
[11:57] first patch do it
[12:07] praise be to God it was very hard it was
[12:13] very very hard to but he she went and
[12:18] she did exactly what the prophet of God
[12:21] told him told her to do and the Bible
[12:24] says when you read down that that cruse
[12:28] of oil never run out and a jar of flour
[12:33] never run out for everyday they'll eat
[12:38] till berths and down rain until there
[12:40] was food she never liked food what
[12:46] brought the blessing this is where the
[12:51] secret of type pain lies the whole
[12:55] secret of paying tithes is that you take
[13:01] God's portion fests take God's portion
[13:07] take that money that belongs to God take
[13:10] it out first don't wait till you have
[13:18] taken out your car note see you have
[13:21] paid your rent tell you I've taking
[13:23] money for food tell you I've done all
[13:25] that before you pay your tithe if that
[13:29] is the way you pay your tithes you can
[13:31] pay your tithe all your life and you
[13:34] wouldn't see the hand of God you are
[13:38] paying your ties all right
[13:39] you've been very faithful you pay is
[13:42] that what you're supposed to pay yet you
[13:43] are not seen the blessings it's because
[13:46] you are not taking that money out first
[13:49] think of what would have happened if the
[13:52] widow had not given Elijah the first
[13:55] portion and had probably eaten with her
[13:58] son and only brought Elijah the left
[14:02] over I bet you she would have died of
[14:07] hunger
[14:11] there was a specific instruction bring
[14:14] me the first batch
[14:23] don't make your ties the last item on
[14:27] your budget you're tight must be the
[14:31] first thing that comes out of your
[14:34] salary the first thing that comes out of
[14:37] your anus out of your income check it
[14:40] out first put it aside even if is not a
[14:46] day that maybe Wednesday or Sunday where
[14:49] you can come to church just take it
[14:51] aside put it aside do not forget if you
[15:01] want to see God move because God has
[15:05] given us his word now we should prove
[15:09] him and see if you not open the doors
[15:12] the windows of heaven and pour as a
[15:15] blessing that will not be able to
[15:18] contain it's a promise God has made and
[15:20] God keeps his word if you are not seeing
[15:24] it examine yourself see what you are
[15:26] doing wrong God is not a liar as he said
[15:31] anything and has not done it praise be
[15:35] to God
[15:36] take God's portion out first let it be
[15:41] the first thing that comes out fresh be
[15:44] to God do it and see what is going to
[15:47] happen the second portion I want to talk
[15:52] of how tight pain becomes a blessing
[15:56] actually I forgot to talk so that does
[15:59] the tight amine arm that the topic the
[16:02] topic for the sub topic for today how
[16:04] tight pain becomes a blessing so that is
[16:06] my point number one point number two I
[16:11] think this is the point number one the
[16:15] Bible says in Malachi 3:11 that when you
[16:21] pay your tithe God rebukes the hand of
[16:25] the Devorah so there is a Devorah now
[16:31] sometimes you take your salary you don't
[16:33] even know what you do with it
[16:35] you don't know where the money went it's
[16:39] like the money ever printed through your
[16:40] palm it happens God has made us a
[16:48] promise that he will be he will reboot
[16:49] the hand of the Devorah and now just
[16:53] think about it that if you do not pay
[16:58] your tight out frist and then you wait
[17:03] till you make all your expenses and then
[17:06] you bring your tight in as the last item
[17:09] you've already wasted the money God is
[17:13] supposed to reboot the hand of the
[17:15] Devorah on that income but he fall ready
[17:19] wasted it and you are bringing your tie
[17:21] to God as the last item so what is there
[17:25] now to rebuke but when you take the
[17:31] first portion out that 10% out there is
[17:36] a 90% daddy's day God is going to big
[17:39] the hand rebuke the handle a Devorah on
[17:42] that 90% but after you have waster than
[17:46] any percent and a tight is your last
[17:49] item and you bring it that's what you
[17:52] have done praise be to God so all these
[18:00] come under my first point that make sure
[18:03] that a tight is the first item that is
[18:06] living your your earnings give it to God
[18:10] now how tight pain also become a
[18:13] blessing honesty is very very important
[18:18] be honest in your type
[18:21] give God exactly what God deserves don't
[18:27] give him what you think he deserves
[18:34] if he's hundred dollars you take $10 at
[18:39] least a thousand you take hundred
[18:43] elicits if it is ten thousand you take
[18:46] thousand dollars part you know there is
[18:49] something about type pain that sometimes
[18:53] we are very honest when they our mouth
[18:56] is small hundred dollars or ten dollars
[19:05] is nothing thousand dollars one hundred
[19:09] dollars and then ten thousand you're
[19:15] just counting hundred five hundred six
[19:18] thousand and you look Harriton is too
[19:21] much why don't you look at the nine
[19:25] thousand that is left and you are ready
[19:27] looking at the tozi I'm going to give to
[19:28] God praise be to God the Bible says
[19:39] godliness with contentment is a great
[19:41] game be content with what you have then
[19:47] 90 percent be content with it as a
[19:50] matter of fact then 90 percent is nine
[19:53] times more than what you are giving God
[19:55] but it never makes you to see that small
[19:58] portion are given to God as something so
[20:00] big and you forget that you have the
[20:02] largest portion and you are looking at
[20:05] what is going to God and then you get
[20:10] fifty thousand and then I think you know
[20:12] what five thousand tight that is big
[20:17] morning and then you begin to decide how
[20:21] much you think you should give God
[20:26] if you give God instead of 5,000 out of
[20:34] 50,000 and your thing is too much so
[20:37] they are going to give God four thousand
[20:39] nine hundred that is very close you've
[20:41] done well guess what is better I didn't
[20:45] even give that money it's better 10%
[20:50] means 10% if you give anything less it
[20:56] was very didn't be honest in your typing
[21:03] another side of being honest in your
[21:06] type pain is this let's see if you are
[21:11] making say thousand dollars every two
[21:14] weeks and paying hundred dollars is not
[21:17] a problem and then you begin to make say
[21:22] ten thousand every two weeks and out of
[21:26] the ten thousand you're supposed to pay
[21:27] thousand dollars every two weeks and
[21:29] then that becomes a problem that becomes
[21:34] a problem in essence do you know what
[21:37] you are telling God what you are telling
[21:39] God is that I am not comfortable and in
[21:43] this much praise the Lord this is where
[21:51] I am comfortable so instead of keeping
[21:54] me here just bring me down here so I can
[21:58] end thousand dollars praying hundred
[22:01] dollars it's not a problem it's when I'm
[22:04] painting it's when I'm paying the
[22:05] thousand dollars that is a problem
[22:08] guess what so a lot of the times we miss
[22:14] out on the blesses of God
[22:17] because of our own selfishness in a
[22:24] sense that's what we're telling God I
[22:27] don't have a problem a hundred dollars
[22:29] every two weeks has died but when God
[22:33] promotes me and I begin to make a lot of
[22:36] money paying nine thousand dollars to
[22:39] God as tight
[22:40] has become a problem so what I'm telling
[22:42] God is that you know what demote me
[22:45] bring me down let's say action speaks
[22:53] louder than ways you don't open your
[22:56] mouth to verbalize it right by your
[22:59] action by your behavior that is what
[23:02] you're telling God praise be to God this
[23:09] topic so this I would say is the main
[23:17] point
[23:19] if you ever missed out on anything
[23:23] during the course of this teaching just
[23:26] make sure you don't miss out on this
[23:29] it's very very important for me this is
[23:35] where the blessing is this is where the
[23:40] blessing is never forget I would have to
[23:48] kiss you not this topic I don't think I
[23:51] would do that I think I may I may just
[23:54] end up somewhere next week whatever I
[23:58] don't care I'll just leave it if there
[24:01] is another time I would come back and
[24:04] finish it off praise be to God now the
[24:07] next thing before
[24:09] I'm just five minutes away
[24:18] you can write it down and read it later
[24:19] we don't have much time
[24:22] Philippians 4:6 says that be careful for
[24:26] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[24:31] supplication make your requests known
[24:34] unto God and then I just want to first
[24:39] write to Matthew 7:7 will says ask and
[24:44] shall be given you seek and ye shall
[24:46] find knock and the door shall be opened
[24:48] unto you
[24:49] praise be to God now God already knows
[24:53] our needs before we then come to him the
[25:00] Bible says you supply all our needs
[25:02] according to his riches in glory he
[25:06] knows what we need before we even come
[25:08] but he expects us to ask he wants you to
[25:12] come and talk about it he wants you to
[25:16] come and ask for data ask receive he was
[25:21] you to seek for data seek find he wants
[25:25] you to knock for David knock the door
[25:28] would be open today he expects you so
[25:31] you know what God has made us a promise
[25:33] that when we pay our tithes we should
[25:37] prove him and see if you not open the
[25:40] windows of heaven and pour us a blessing
[25:43] that will not be able to contain but you
[25:46] know what don't just take your tights
[25:48] and then just put it in an envelope will
[25:50] come and dump it in the basket when you
[25:55] take your time even though God has media
[25:58] promise
[25:59] take that tight to God ref ed got his
[26:04] own word reflect God to his bone world
[26:09] this is what your word and joins me to
[26:12] do that as you bring a tenth of my anus
[26:15] or my income on my salary to you as
[26:18] tight and I have it here your word says
[26:21] we should prove you and see further I
[26:24] bring these are my requests nevertheless
[26:26] let your will be done
[26:28] look if you have to soak that tight
[26:30] if you have to suck it in tears so get
[26:33] wet and come and put it in the offering
[26:37] praise be to God if you have to suck it
[26:42] wet in prayer suck it in prayer and come
[26:45] and put it in don't just take you to
[26:50] come and put it and that is good but not
[26:53] good enough
[26:55] pray over it I forgot his word remind
[26:59] god of his promises talk to God about it
[27:03] praise be to God let God know that you
[27:06] are in expectation let him know that you
[27:10] are counting on his word of promise let
[27:12] him know that you are proving him is
[27:14] that prove me and see praise be to God
[27:19] how does Taipei become a blessing that
[27:22] is the topic of today I'm just a minute
[27:26] away I just had a little tinny here
[27:29] about maybe a judge on his seat and what
[27:31] have you
[27:33] when he when you come before that is
[27:35] they said I just paraphrase in now no
[27:37] time the judge doesn't care how
[27:39] intelligent you are you can come and
[27:42] speak book knowledge the judge doesn't
[27:44] fear that when the judge takes his seat
[27:47] what he fears is a lawyer who knows his
[27:52] constitution a lawyer who knows the
[27:55] statutes
[27:56] who has read statutes he has read a law
[27:59] that he doesn't give the judge room to
[28:02] do what he wants to do he will refer him
[28:05] the law says this and the judge has
[28:07] nothing to do god loves it if you can
[28:12] refer him to his word praise be to God
[28:15] come by the way of the word FL go to his
[28:19] word and let God know that you are
[28:21] counting on his word of promise
[28:23] stay right there if you don't see the
[28:26] hand of God then there is something
[28:30] wrong somewhere praise be to God we are
[28:32] right on time next week I don't know how
[28:35] next week is going to look like I have a
[28:37] lot of change to prepare for next week
