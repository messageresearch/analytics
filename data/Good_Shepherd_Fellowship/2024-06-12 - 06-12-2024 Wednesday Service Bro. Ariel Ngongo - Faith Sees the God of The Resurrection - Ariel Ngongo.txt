house of the Lord uh we just want to take this time to appreciate the pastor for giving us once again the opportunity to stand behind this holy desk to be able to preach the word um it is really with uh trembling and and and reverence that uh we have been privileged to speak to the brother of Jesus Christ tonight uh please don't look at the men I I I have mistakes I have my ups and down but there's one thing I know is what God has done in my life that's what I can only testify about and I know nobody will be worthy you know to even stand here but we trust in his Holiness We Trust in his Mercy that he will be able to come in the midst of us tonight he will really deal with your heart I don't know what you are dealing with but God knows that's why we want to approach him tonight with really reverence and then open our Bibles in the Book of Job if you will please certainly appreciate every single one of you for being here tonight and for those that are online we want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we want to open our Bible in the Book of Job chapter 14 job 14:7 for the Bible say says if you thereare you can say amen amen amen are you happy to be here oh yeah thank the Lord for that job chapter 14:7 says for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will spr again that the tender Branch thereof will not cease though the root therefore thereof waxs old in the earth and the stock there off die in the ground yet the sense of water you will bud and will bring forth like a a plant if you look at this scripture very carefully if God could make a way for a flower to live again what about you and I so it doesn't matter how dead we can be tonight it doesn't matter what is the sickness whatever situation it is God is still alive if there is hope in the tree means that there's hope tonight and God is able to give you what your heart desire if we approach it the same way I also want to open the Bible in the book of Roman Romans chapter 4: 16 Romans chapter 4 verse 16 the Bible says says therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed not to what that only which is of the law but to that also which is of faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many Nation before him who he believed even God who quickeneth the dead in other word in another way who giveth life to the dead so Abraham was a strong believer of a god of Resurrection and call those things which be not as though they were who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many Nation according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being now weak in faith he ConEd not so Abraham decided to considered he decided not to consider his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the the deadness of Sarah's wom he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being uh fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform shall we pray again Heavenly Father may you bless us tonight Lord may you come Lord Jesus father feel so nervous Lord but I just trust that the same God that came and reveal me this message oh God will be the one father that will deliver it father Lord we pray now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you you may be seated for a while tonight by God's grace I want to speak on a message which really I was listening to a message somewhere of course I'll read the message later uh I want to speak on the thought here Faith sees the god of Resurrection Faith sees the god of Resurrection faith is the six sense and that six sense element sees the God who gives life to the dead sorry I forgot to put that last week so we see here I was listening to a message calm down and brother bham said something really that caught my attention it was in the world fair he says showing by scientific research that science has been able to achieve in the natural thing he says now we are here showing by spiritual research what God has been able to achieve with people who will believe his word amen it says now to achieve scientific things you've got to work in scientific line to achieve spiritual things you got to work in spiritual line it says little science that didn't know the ABC founded why there were spiritual scientist amen how many spiritual stist we have here it says this they seems the things they believe it it says men did it by education the natural scientist the spiritual scientist done it by Revelation it says one by education the other by Revelation right so now there's two group here so tonight we have to identify to one of this group because we cannot be in m in a middle but I truly believe that we are standing here tonight has spiritual scientist that has to do all things by Revelation now in Hebrews chapter 11 the Bible says and I want us to pay attention it's a very familiar scripture here it says now Faith it does not say faith is it says now so it's it's a present tense element so it's not just based on something that happened yesterday is something that is happening now so basically if you want to receive something of the Lord tonight you have to apply it to the present tense so now as I will be I'll be talking tonight and I'll just ask you to do something for me if you have any situation in Your Heart Take God's word and apply faith into it and let's see what happened because God cannot fail there's one thing that God cannot do is fail so now Faith is a substance of things hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen so it already takes away the sight so you don't have to see it all right now in the Amplified version it says now Faith is the Assurance you know amen faith is the Assurance it's a title deed so it's something that you already have it says a confirmation of things hop for so it's divinely guaranteed it says and the evidence of Things Not Seen I love this it says the conviction of the reality so now it continues here it says faith comprehend as fact so you can't see it but yet is a fact so you can be able to touch something that is as real as I'm I'm looking at you tonight so this is what faith is oh my faith comprehend as fact what cannot be experienced by the physical senses so Saints tonight by God's grace I felt in my heart to bring to break this thing Faith a little bit more so that we can get something out of it so if we have a desire we can tap into that world and get get something from the Lord now in another message here brother bham says faith is a substance it says paragraph 4 49 it says now listen closely give me your attention the F the senses the five senses in oh I might I might as well just read it here it says now listen real Qui closely and give me your attention now this senses these five senses is this right see taste feel smell hear is that is that right it says them five senses control the entire human body is that true see taste feel smell and hear now there is none of them that declares Faith so Saints let's get rid of the five senses so if you want to receive something from the Lord you need to completely anal the five those five senses are we together it says faith is the six sense not to some people as you want to as mental telepathy some people think it's just mental telepathy right it says whatsoever you want always to call it many of them call it names but to me that was to brother Bram but you have to take it to yourself to you what is Faith it says faith oh my goodness where am I at oh my is the six sense is that right it says but to me it faith that is in above all five senses of the human body you see what it what I mean it says faith is the only direct and positive sense it's the six sense so which means your five senses are now real you can't see something you can also be called a blind and say you know what this is red but it may not be red you understand what I'm saying but Fai here is as real as I'm I'm touching something but now you have to analge those five senses then just grab these six sense oh my I hope somebody will cat something tonight and receive something tonight it says faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling you do not feel Faith that's right sometime you know the presence of the Lord will fall into a room and people say oh wow I feel it brother bam says are we are we together here glory to God he says faith is more than feeling you do not feel Faith you don't taste Faith you don't smell Faith you don't see it faith is the substance of things hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen oh my goodness so faith is the evidence direct positive this is my own note just the same as the sight is positive declaring that you are sitting here tonight it says faith is direct evidence of things not not seen F tast smell or heard faith is as if can you just imagine this I don't have five bucks in my pocket all right it's empty I can prove it there's nothing here all right so Faith you the fact is there is nothing there all right there's absolutely nothing there all of you guys have seen it but faith can believe that there is $5 in the pocket and go inside and get the $5 I don't have to feel it I don't have to touch it because if I believe it it brings that element to come to pass I I'm just bringing you a little higher in faith here tonight are you are we together here tonight all right oh my is as real as the rest of the senses may God give us the revelation of what it is may God help us now I want to declare to you tonight the senses of faith is real and you can't tap into the channel of Faith where all things are possible Saint I just pray that somebody will come a little higher to reach that place where all things become possible and if you could catch the revelation of what this is you can get anything you want to tonight if somebody live here the the same way they came in something is wrong they have not entered into the channel of faith yet they don't know what faith is if you heal if you sick tonight you can't leave this place if you tap into that channel you will receive what your heart desire is I may not know it but God knows it and God cannot move until you believe you say brother Ariel what are you saying Jesus says I am the vine ye are the branches the branches does not bear fruit sorry the the vine does not bear fruit rather but but it's the branches that bear fruit so God will stay there until you believe his word and then something will happen sometime you say okay let me just relax and wait God to do something he will not do do it because the Bible says only by faith that you can please God so if you want to please God you must believe it you might as well believe it Oh Glory to God who who want to please God tonight oh I want to please God tonight I I I want my my service to be worthy H by his grace tonight oh my believe believ in God the prophet says I might go a little faster here just bear with me there's something good that is coming it says now the senses are worldly instrument do you believe it God can control them I would admit it but they are not given to us to contact our heavenly father those five senses does not contact our heavenly father let's look what it says because he is not in human flesh God is Spirit now we contact him by Spirit through faith so if you want to contact God tonight you need to come the way of Faith right it says believing oh Saints you can't get anything tonight until you believe it let me just say maybe it might be a bad news but it's true you will not leave this place with your the desire of your heart if you don't believe that's what God says and we staying behind it the only thing we saying all of these things is just so that you can be blessed so that I can be blessed in another message forsaking all it says I think that what the Christian are to do tonight oh my goodness find out what you've got if something gets just a little higher I can reach it I can't reach it rather I will get me a step ladder and climb up to it if some if something seems a little Out Of Reach in the Bible God has promised I will stay on my knees and climb Jacob ladder till I reach it cause it's mine God give it to me if Divine Healing is Promised in the Bible and I'm sick I will stay there until God give me because it's a promise so now we we we we we're getting somewhere so if there is a promise I can use Jacob ladder by faith and reach that promise and get whatever I need Saint there are one thing that God cannot do is lie he cannot write something and then turn his back and say I didn't write it or I didn't say it but God wants you to hold on to a promise if you hold on to a promise all things are possible tonight oh my goodness glory to God your five senses tonight are declaring I can't see it tiredness maybe there's so much big you know bills that you have to pay maybe there are many disappointment in life maybe sicknesses maybe anxiety maybe old age Maybe addiction maybe different things going on in your life those five senses are feeling it when you wake up in the morning you feel the pain because those five senses are declaring it but down in your heart you say God promise that he is my healer he is my deliverer he is my comfort so when you wake up with that promise you apply Faith to it you see standing up you you get up in the morning you ready to go to work you you ready to go to church why because you have tapped into a Channel of faith God charged your battery to go to get up to start your day worshiping God because you tap into a certain Channel and you got energized by it oh my we cannot receive anything of the Lord tonight without faith let's look at some scriptures here Isaiah chapter 40 oh my has thou not known has thou not heard that the HL lasting God the Lord the creator of the end of the Earth fth not neither is Worthy is neither is is wored there is no searching of his understanding he gave power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall look at this it says but they that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they shall mount with wingless ego they shall run and not be wored and they shall walk and and Oh Glory to God do you believe this how many of us believe it tonight yes I did not write it I'm just quoting what he said and this word is infallible it can't Fair hold the next verse oh my goodness I back I love this scripture this scripture struck me one night oh my long story but anyways I stand upon my watch and set me upon a tower and we watch to see what he will say unto me what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision take your book write the vision write what it said sometimes s let me just open the parenthesis here you can't read your Bible every morning but sometime you have to write it down you have to take and write the promise put it in your Bible put it in a wall somewhere so every morning when you're going to work you remember there is a promise there every time that you come into the house you look at that little paper you said that's a promise God gave me since we need to get into business with God if we need to receive the Holy Ghost we need to mean business until he gives us the Holy Ghost we can't just stay there starchy and cold and look warm how much how much do you want it how much do you want the Holy Ghost because if God does not give you the the Holy Ghost you make him a liar because if it says repent you repent the right way you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you did it the right way God is obligated to empty heaven and to give you the Holy Ghost because Oh Glory to God he promised it even the young ones if you stay in your room you know you did things the right way just wait he will visit you in that room you know sometime people think the Holy Ghost the experience of God is just the angel will fly out Saint it's a conviction in your soul no man can take that away from you oh glory to God he has to be a revelation it's personal it's not just about who is preaching it's personal it's an experience you can you can be down in the valley but when you remember that experience he energ you it will make you cry in your car when you driveing when you listen to a song you crying and people wonder say what in the world is going on with this man what is going on with this woman because youve met God something happened to you no man can take that away from you Saints let me say this no denomination no church nothing nobody can take that away from you because you came from God and you're returning back to God hallelujah glory be to God where was I at uh verse three is that right for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end he shall speak the promises of God speaks louder when is the appointed time when he reaches the appointed time oh glory to God don't worry you can lay down and sleep that promise will come to pass Hallelujah it shall speak for itself it says and lie though it ter wait for it because it will surely come he will not ter it says behold his soul which is lift up is not upright in him but the just but the just shall leave by by Faith by what his faith it's not your righteousness you can be righteous oh that's why is Jehovah Chen is your righteousness You Must Believe in the righteous one to be righteous sometime you know you can't sin against God you you know you did something wrong you go to God you say Lord you know I'm I'm I'm a I'm a sinful man I I need your help you are my righteousness Lord you said it if you confess the right way God will give you peace in your heart you know the devil will punch all your wrongs but when you point him the word when you point him what Jesus has done for you that some one he cannnot play with it he knows that is real so you need Faith to believe what Jesus has done for you you need to believe that he is your righteousness oh my goodness tonight with my my goodness the next quote here sir we would see Jesus we're coming somewhere we're going somewhere and I like this he says now would you ever know you touched him he says if if there wasn't something to come back and told you see faith is not something it's not a myth faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence that something has happened of Things Not Seen sense this is deep this is powerful if we did not have a prophet I don't know where we will be huh if God did not send William brandham we'll be in the full confusion here oh glory to God he says it's not just a make belief saying oh yeah Hallelujah I got it it says that's been too much in you Pentecostal people to begin with you rejoice about things that you don't have people holler about different things but they don't have it faith is absolutely a substance can you preach with me you know can we do that tonight it will help me a lot it's not a hope oh oh no I'm hoping that this can no no that's not faith hope you just wish that something may it may or may not happen but faith is in in you you know it's going to happen it says hope is Faith is the substance of things so forth but when Faith takes it it becomes the substance to you you hope for the evidence of things not seen you know what is the substance in I didn't put this the message there brother bam says in the message perseverance it says a substance is something you can hold on to in another message experience fifth by experience something you have Webster says something real not imaginary something solid existing tangible so you can get hold of it right my goodness it says there is only one thing you have to do what is it is to appropriate that Faith this word is strong very powerful you must be able to appropriate that faith and that faith is something you know not something that you at or guess at you know it something happens it says Through the Ages people has rested upon this so if you have to rest on it there's somebody before you that rest upon it he worked for them so if he worked for them it will work for you so it's not like oh you've been in this road before Oh you alone you don't know when no this is some the Bible tell telling you somebody before you went there and they came back with the evidence of the faith right there are people in this room they have the evidence they have stepped into that channel and they receive what their heart desire is there are sister here that couldn't bear children but they tap into that channel they had a children a child there are people that had sicknesses cancer whatsoever they tap into that channel they receive the healing so Saints if you leave this place in unbeliever something is wrong because people we all sitting here as the evidence we Are Witnesses we've been there we tested it we came out of it with with with a substance I'm sitting here as a witness s for me to preach the word word let me just say this is just God's grace as brother one always says if we have to trace back our families nobody will be even here God decided to rewrite our life when we were in sin but God in his Mercy he saw you he saw me you know it was look it was protecting you back to some generation prior to that he was looking he says this is my son this is my daughter you might come out of there with hurts and different things in your life but Sint God is looking at you he's willing to give you revelation of what these things means he send you a prophet for a purpose we're not just in this corner of this street for for just randomly like that there is a purpose you say I'll just open this thing you know Mary in the Bible when the Bible says the the the virgin shall conceive normally if we have to read it is that Mary shall conceive because in the Bible was written virgin but that virgin was Mary Mary came into this world she never even know who she was until she the angel came to her when the angel came and broke the Seal of who she is she could relate back to a promise that a virgin shall conceive and as soon as she believe it she conceive I mean I mean yeah she conceived yes indeed she did not feel any sensation she just said Let It Be according to your will something happened to her after a while we see the baby coming out we see Mary killing a child how did you get here how can you have a child without a man you know you know why because Isaiah said it you talking about faith you're talking about a man and a woman yielding to the will of God Saints tonight if you could yield to the voice of God something will happen to you since I'm not even getting to I mean brother one I won't have time to finish this but I just trust the Lord you know oh my goodness my goodness never learn to sweat like this you know but we thank the Lord amen it says Oh Glory to God I'll get the next quote and I'll go a little faster here it says work is Faith express it says now Faith is is a revelation is that right are is if okay I'll just go before there so if Ephesians chapter 2:9 it says by Grace so how do you get the Revelation the Bible says by for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of your own it is the gift of God so there is another portion that is coming out of here of Faith so God by his grace thank you so much brother then I appreciate it God God by his grace he gives you the revelation of something it's a you understand what I'm saying so it says not of work lest any man should boast you can only have faith as God gives you so you see it's a special Grace that God want to give to you so God decided by his grace grace and mercy it says I will open the eyes of this sister this brother to believe my word so when God gives you Grace he also knows that you will believe because he cannot give you something knowing that you fail so God in his Mercy he loves you he had chosen you he gives you even the revelation of the word so that you can come up to believe it and then as soon as you believe it you receive what you desire is your heart is desire is that's why when we sing Amazing Grace we have to trace it back how are we singing it Amazing Grace is God's election when was that Amazing Grace happened before the foundation of the world it was not the day you came to the altar The Amazing Grace was when you were in the back part of God's mind so as he was creating things he thought of you tonight sometime we think like oh man I just existed no you did not just existed or the scripture Jeremiah it says I ordain you to be Prophet when he was yet not even his mother did not even conceive him he was already a prophet Jeremiah chapter 1 brother one is that right I think it's in the book of Jeremiah chapter 1 oh my glory to God it says faith is a gift of God even now even how you may be yet it must take you must have faith your faith can only rest if you are a Christian upon the proven word of God so faith has has to be resting upon something it cannot rest upon your opinion your faith has to be based on something that is proven to be truth and there's only one thing that is proven to be truth that's the word of God it says five faith is a revelation of from God faith is a revelation there is where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed Reve it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you did not work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith so you never had Faith huh is that a quote is that brother Bram are we reading the same thing right it's given to you by God's grace God reveals it to you therefore faith is the Revelation and the whole church of God is built upon the Revelation I'm not talking about this building I'm talking about you the next quote please oh my goodness oh yes this is a part where I would desire to to speak the message look it says listen just closely to this remark I don't forget to to get this now Faith is designed is designed to see what God will and want there is no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed to give to the human race to find out what the will of God is it says you take your faith and you got it and don't focus with the word then leave it alone you won't you you got the wrong Faith but when your god-given faith focuses on the word you directly what in line and zeroed so you have a scripture you apply faith into it you are zero because God cannot fail so if you use his word you apply faith into it Saint you going to get what your heart desire is that's why Jesus says nothing is is there anything too hard for the Lord no God help us this hour great hour that we live in faith designed to to see what God wants how do you see it through the camera of his word his promise this is a full Revelation what of Jesus Christ it says when the faith that is in you focuses you to do this word you are focused away from the denomination and Creed and everything you focus right straight on the word of God you are zero de it only needs a little touch off amen it says that prayer flies straight in the presence of God because there is nothing to stop it my my my in another message where the BAM says prayer is not God coming down is you going up if you need a quote I can share it with you I just don't have it now now Joshua chapter 2 verse 9 if you have your Bible you can open it with me how many of us know this woman called RAB now this woman R she's called to be a heal woman that's what we call these days right correct she said unto the men when the spice came to her house now we need to pay attention very closely here there's something important she said unto the man I know that God has given you this land and that your terror is falling upon us that all the inhabitants of the the land fent because of you now look at what reab says it says we have heard how the Lord dri up so reab a prostitute living in Jericho heard the word of God because faith comes by hearing you must be able to hear the word of God she never been to church she's not even an Israelite but what came to this specific woman to be able to catch something because the Bible also is spoken of RAB but what did she tap into for her to join that family that was faith and it was a revelation that God chosen to give her what by his grace you see it brings us back when the mind of God she was a hidden but in the mind of God she was a chosen one oh glory to God we have heard he dag the Red Sea for you and then came out of Egypt what uh what he did unto the two King of the Amorite and the on the other side of the Jordan look at what the prophet says the token it says anyone knows anything about the Bible knows that the Harlot was what predestinated she sure was the Bible says that was Hebrew now is quoting Hebrew Hebrew CH 11:3 it says now oh she perish not with them who what she had to believe but now the prophet says in order for you to have faith it must be given by Grace you know why now she's an elect it was something that was already done s I'm trying to cut your attention somewhere we're going somewhere if you want to receive something tonight it's your choice God has already done it but he needs you to have faith oh my goodness that's right she believed the message of the hour you know a few months ago or maybe a year brother the one was preaching on uh uh the message I think he spoke about it on Wednesday he was talking about what is the message I think you read in the Book of John when you were going through the series of John the message of the hour in her time in her time God was the message when she believe in God she receive the message of the hour so the message of the hour is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same Jesus tonight when she met that Jesus she believ in him now Jesus is the word do you believe it that same Jesus we open the Bible every day but it's laying there everything is there a revelation what is faith is God by the spirit revealing to you something that is going to do or he has promised it says now if you only hear faith comes by hearing but hearing is not Faith a love of bread is not the purchase of 20 cents 25 cents but 25 cents is not the love of bread see hearing hearing only brings the word that produces fa Faith but faith is the substance of things for the evidence of Things Not Seen then you see you hear the word you see why is important to listen to the word of God this is it the you hear the word god reveals it to you that is true and by the spirit reveal true confirm your faith to God so we not just coming to church just to make as a routine God has a purpose God has a purpose in everything oh my goodness I'll have to pass the Bible talk about Hebrews chapter 13 it talks about jeffi it talk about David he talk about Samuel and the prophet it says who through faith subdue kingdoms they brought righteousness obtained the promise stop the mouth of lying these are the rord of men who did it they were dealing with situation but God gave them they overcame they over they actually was so powerful they quenched the the the power of of the fire by faith now let's talk about the God faith that sees the god of Resurrection I got my inspiration from this message here the power of decision I was just leaving the house going to work really quick in the morning and I heard it something told me stop there there's something for you and that's what inspired me tonight he says so the devil usually start a little flare you know situation come in church or a problem arise if people get distracted this is Satan that is doing it it says the devil use usually start a little flare so watch it I try to cut off the move uh he's trying he tries to cut off the the the move of God every time he will do that he still the same devil use the same technique that he did in the old days he still uses them today we could only read the Old Testament and we learn the TAC of the enemy of the devil how he that he does it we find out his power he had power and that power was death it says but he had no power beyond that it says just death end his power then beyond death Faith sees the god of Resurrection it says after the devil ends his power of death then he finishes the the devil can do no more but after death Faith sees the resurrection god of the Resurrection That's The Power of Faith to believe it says he we standing over here behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see with your your natural eyes now you might be going through a situation it's so dark things are not working you try this it doesn't work you try this it doesn't work now look at what the prophet says by faith Stand By You directs you to that God of resurrection and a God of all wisdom who has ordained our path is standing just behind every trial that's right that's right so when your natural eyes are looking at different things that is going on but God when he he gives you Faith you see beyond that trial situation can happen in church church just look beyond that trial look at something God is doing something because you're about to miss your your your your blessing if you get distracted and in the midst of all devil the devil situ then our mind goes to different things we become distracted we trying to figure it out these things oh what what what is going on here it's the devil but if you could spend your time on your knees say Lord help me let Open my eyes to see beyond this trial sister I think you can just close up the PowerPoint I'm just going to preach like there I think I I had different things but due to time we're not going to have time to continue to far here let's talk about Abraham here Roman if you have your Bible Romans chapter 19 oh my goodness or maybe if I I mention the quot you can just go to to the quotes yeah now the we just read there it says being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's home he stug not at the promise of God to unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to God Saint if you look in the Bible God visited Abraham seven time you can't read it you'll see it the first encounter Genesis 12 verse1 he was 75 and Sarah SAR was 65 and of course you know the story she was Barren is that right amen Now by faith God called Abraham he call and there even a place here brother says oh my goodness he says by faith perhaps he thought like this if there is a God who made the ark let Noah flow through he still live today somewhere in the land of the Heathen he was a surgeoner he touched the hand of God in there God gave him a revelation that there is a city whose Builder and make was God he was a hidden but for some reason he tapped into a certain Channel and that channel of Revelation when he heard the voice he stopped everything he said Sarah everybody come on let's back we got to go not even knowing where it was going but how many of us if God says do this we say oh God why you know things does not look the same Faith looks beyond you see Faith looks beyond what you can't touch what you can't feel it goes beyond that the second encounter God promised to him Genesis 12:7 I'll give you the L the third one Genesis 13:14 you know when after he separated from lot the fourth encounter MC the king of salom after he he was returning from rescuing his brother his nephew lot Genesis 14:12 18 rather 15 the the fifth encounter by Vision he gave him a pro promise of a child I will give you I'll visit you he's not going to be a leazar of Damascus but that child will come to Sarah he believed God and the Bible says he counted it to him for righteousness can you imagine you dying physically brother bam says I won't have time to read it he mentioned about the room of of of of of Sarah it was completely dry but what did Abraham tap into when all the senses was declaring that everything was dead but he tapped into a place where all things are possible oh my goodness I want to read the story here and then we'll close there oh my goodness may the Lord help us tonight do you love the Lord can we give God a hand please he is worthy of that he's worthy of Our Praise amen oh my goodness we we we serve a true and wonderful God he is not dead is alive life you know even Jesus Christ himself he came to this world Jesus saw beyond the flesh this flesh here he knew who he was the prophet spoke about him can you imagine Jesus himself had to have faith to believe what was spoken about him tonight we living under our privileges Jesus why gave him the power is because he believed what was spoken about him he believed the prophets David says in the volume of the book it is written of me he knew that the prophet the Psalms wrote about him but it doesn't just stop with Jesus the B the prophet spoke about you too but you need Faith you need Faith to tap into that place and to live accordingly I don't do this not because somebody's behind me I don't do it because I have the revelation of what God has given me I know who I am that's right oh my goodness Genesis chapter 3:15 he was the seed of the woman he knew he was the seed of the woman when something you know sin enter into the Garden of Eden butam says God did not let Adam and Eve to leave all to go out of the garden just empty-handed like that he gave them a promise so they left the Garden of Eden with a promise can you imagine you you done something wrong everything you know the animals are are going crazy because of the mistake that you have made but yet God in his Mercy looks at and say I'm not going to let you go like that and that same God doesn't want you to live this place this way that's why he's giving you a promise he's giving you this word so that you can hold on to that you can look beyond your situation and grab something that is real amen hallelujah the perfect faith brother bam says something here I think if you have that quote perfect Faith preaching 6063 is right at the bottom closer uh I think I never mention say now the only things you have to do then is have faith in what you are faith in what the word says you are Jesus had faith in the word of God that says what he was it is written of me referring to John chapter Psalm chapter uh 47 didn't David and the Psalms and the prophet and all of them speak of him now in the following paragraph 74 paragraph 74 I think is the next one H look at what the prophet says for the word identify identified himself what he was that's talking about Jesus it says the same word identify us so it was not just Jesus alone you were also there let's look at scriptures here let's look at Jesus First Genesis Chapter 14 verse 10 the septer shall not depart from Judah not the law the lawgiver from between this feet until shalow comes shalow means the Messiah the scepter had not you know couldn't leave the the line of Judah until the Messiah comes he was the Messiah he was shoh Isaiah 7:14 he was Emmanuel it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and the bear shall it shall be called Emanuel Isaiah chapter 9:6 unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace there Daniel Daniel 2:34 God Jesus was that stone that came out of that mountain to job he says I know my redeemer live to Ezekiel he saw the will in the middle of the wheel you see all of these things if we had to go through and look at all of these things there are plenty but to you Jesus says this son shall follow them that believe now it's about you let's let's let's bring it home now Jesus says the son shall follow them that believe if you are a Believer the faith the faith of God that move in you revelation will open your eyes to see beond and see The God Who Quicken the Dead you can't sit here spiritually you dead you cannot connect to the word but we have a god tonight who quickeneth the dead Hallelujah they can give life again Ezekiel says does this dry bone speak again can they revive again they can't live again it says yes and later on the scripture says they became a mighty Army it says father only that knows there nowhere he says speak to this dry born the power and brother bam talks about the fourth light L Wesley the restoration of gift it says now the fourth light is the revelation of the word is the time in which you and I are living in oh my goodness you can read in the message restitution of the Bride tree now Malachi 4 comes around if you have Malachi 4 verse 5 talking about us he says behold I God will send you Elijah so there's three of them there's God there's Elijah and there's you so you are part of that promise it does not just stop there Revelation chapter 10 it says verse one and I saw a mighty Angel but call a covenant Angel which was Christ revelation CH 10:7 it says at the voice which I heard oh my no no no in the days of the voice rather of the seventh angel he talks to a Prophet Elijah the prophet it does not stop there Revelation 8 to11 he talks about the bride she must prophesy again we see Christ the messenger and we see you later on the prophet says the bride the spirit and the bride say come but the says no he does not just stop there he says the bride the spirit and the prophet will say the same thing so there's not going to be a contradiction between those three so if God said it the prophet will repeat it you will say the same thing you talking about Revelation you're talking about faith faith is a re Revelation Rapture is a Revelation the new birth it's a revelation Oh Glory to God do we love the Lord tonight there's one day this man called Lazareth was dead was dead John 11 verse 20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat in the house then mat say unto the Lord Lord if thou has been there my brother had not uh had not died but I know that even now whatsoever that will ask God God will give it to you and Jesus said unto her that brother shall rise again what a promise Mar says unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection she's projecting in the future then God brings Jesus bring back to he said no I am the resurrection and life I am the present God I'm the present God I'm able to do it now don't project me in the future don't project me in the past present me now we all need something from the Lord tonight AR we do we have a desire tonight can you hold on to a promise as we're closing here 1114 oh 26 he says whosoever leaveth that believe in me shall never die believe thou this he says Jesus says take ye away the stone matter take ye the stone matter the sister of him that was dead said unto the Lord by this he stinking now that's the senses of the nose was declaring something is that right are we together oh no master he s is he has been there for 4 days look at what Jesus says for he has been there four days Jesus says unto her it says say I not unto thee that if that would believe that should have see the glory of God one of the five senses declar something God says no I am the resurrection and life oh no he will s she move into something different know the man said have I not told you that if you believe you see the glory of God tonight who believes tonight brother one I'm under expectation for something to happen you know
