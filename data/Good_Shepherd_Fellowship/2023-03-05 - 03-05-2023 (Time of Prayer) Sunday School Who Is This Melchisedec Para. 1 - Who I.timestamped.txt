[5:07] is written all things are possible to
[5:11] them that believe yes
[5:13] as we cry as the man who had the
[5:16] epileptic child Lord I believe help thou
[5:20] my unbelief
[5:22] we thank thee for thy great power
[5:26] thy great revelation
[5:29] of thyself to us in this last days
[5:32] it makes our heart most happy
[5:35] and joyful to know that we have come in
[5:38] contact with the Living God
[5:41] who vindicates it right back in physical
[5:45] material evidences
[5:48] as he did in the days gone by and as he
[5:50] has promised for this day
[5:52] we're so grateful to thee our God
[5:56] this dark day where no one seems to know
[5:58] which way to go we're so glad that we
[6:01] found the safety zone yes the retreat
[6:05] now bless us tonight Lord as we speak of
[6:08] Thy word and the promises
[6:11] that's given to us may we nurture them
[6:14] in our hearts cherish them with
[6:17] reverence and Obey them with real Godly
[6:20] discipline for we asked it in Jesus name

[6:53] never come from that thank you may the
[6:57] Lord bless you
[6:58] I'll do everything I can I'll put it
[7:01] right in foreign missions so I'll know
[7:03] it'll go to the kingdom of God
[7:05] and if the Lord willing I'll take it
[7:06] myself over to the lands to bring the
[7:09] same gospel that you've been set and
[7:10] listened to this week that I know it'll
[7:13] be done in the way that you believe it
[7:15] the Lord help me to do it
[7:18] I am very grateful for the great
[7:22] attendance this week and for all you

[7:32] and we're grateful to each and every one
[7:35] of you
[7:36] Billy said to me this morning
[7:38] he said Daddy
[7:40] if you would have come with me this
[7:42] morning earlier right after daylight
[7:45] and stand out year around in these
[7:47] places and watch mothers feeding their
[7:49] babies in the car
[7:52] them poor people setting that rain
[7:54] waiting for the doors to open
[7:57] you see what a hypocrite I'd be if I
[8:00] told you anything but the truth
[8:02] I'd really be a foul person
[8:05] sometimes I have to hurt
[8:08] but it's not because and I want to it's
[8:10] because it's just not me that's hurting
[8:12] it's truth that hurts
[8:15] but I believe that's the reason you come
[8:18] because I'm deadly sincere with you and
[8:20] do all I can to help you
[8:23] the Lord help each and every one of you
[8:26] and now I want to thank the people for
[8:28] their fine cooperation the people of the
[8:31] city
[8:32] here also who gave us let us have the
[8:36] reading of this Schoolhouse this uh
[8:40] Auditorium in the gym

[8:44] you're here
[8:46] and also I want to thank Tristan Colvin
[8:48] which is a custodian here
[8:51] or his fine cooperation and helping us
[8:53] to get this and being with us each night
[8:56] we thank the Jeffersonville Police Force
[8:59] or coming up here and watching with a
[9:03] real cheap cause I think about two
[9:05] dollars an hour at the police were put
[9:07] up your own special duty to park the
[9:09] cars you'll see that there was no
[9:11] nothing happened and everything was all
[9:13] right we're grateful to the people for
[9:15] that
[9:16] and to the um the old soul the engineer
[9:20] here on the the board I've noticed him
[9:23] and all it's affiliated with this we are
[9:26] certainly grateful to you
[9:28] I thank each and every one of you for
[9:30] the gifts
[9:31] Billy just brought me this afternoon a
[9:34] gift several of them and boxes candy and
[9:38] so forth and one of them was the
[9:41] Beatitudes with a picture of Christ
[9:44] worked in it it was a Sermon on the
[9:47] Mount it certainly was beautiful I
[9:49] certainly thank you and so many things I
[9:51] don't know how to thank you for it then
[9:53] also for your your sponsoring financing
[9:57] the meeting we certainly do appreciate
[10:00] it with all of our heart the Lord bless
[10:03] each one of you richly
[10:05] Billy said there was many people he had
[10:08] been asking for private interviews
[10:10] during the time
[10:11] and many asked and had little babies to
[10:14] be dedicated
[10:15] or how I want to do that
[10:18] but you see when I come this time it's
[10:21] so urgent I have to stay right all the
[10:24] time and study this word in prayer on
[10:26] the count of bringing these messages
[10:27] see they're not they're they're
[10:30] extraordinary to us
[10:32] because
[10:33] it's finding the will of God and then
[10:36] speaking of things and all that has to
[10:37] meet together and asking God just which
[10:40] one to open up
[10:42] now the Lord willing we'll be back again
[10:45] soon as soon as we can find a day I made
[10:47] a emotion or said something about Easter
[10:51] I better check that because I think I've
[10:53] got a schedule in California along about
[10:56] that time so that may be wrong however
[10:58] when we return again to the Tabernacle
[11:00] we'll send you a card and uh the church
[11:04] and and give you the the date and time
[11:07] then I'll maybe at that time again I
[11:10] haven't put any time to praying for the
[11:13] sake we haven't had one service that we
[11:15] brought the people up and prayed for
[11:16] them we've been sending them out and our
[11:19] Brethren here has been preaching
[11:20] brotherly Vale and brother these other
[11:23] brothers has been preaching and praying
[11:26] for the sick and doing the water baptism
[11:28] baptizing rather and letting me stay
[11:31] alone with the word
[11:33] we thank these men they've done a
[11:35] gallant job
[11:36] there's so many friends here I'd like to
[11:38] meet I look down see John and Earl and
[11:41] there's Dr Lee Vale one of the managers
[11:43] of the campaign
[11:45] brother Roy borders them man I haven't
[11:47] even got I haven't even no more than
[11:49] shook their hand I haven't had a chance
[11:51] to I think of my friends from Kentucky
[11:53] and around in here and Minister friends
[11:55] how I would like to shake their hands
[11:58] brother Blair I noticed him here the
[12:00] other day and many of those men that I I
[12:03] love and they've been to several
[12:04] meetings I've never even as much as
[12:05] shook their hand I I'm trying it isn't
[12:09] because I don't want to do that it's
[12:10] because I haven't the time to do it and
[12:13] I just to hurry dedicating the babies
[12:15] sure my own son my little grandson was
[12:19] supposed to be dedicated to this meeting
[12:20] I haven't had time to do it little David
[12:23] I'm Grandpa twice now so Mr May if he
[12:27] sure tonight give me that team look like
[12:29] we'll have to use it pretty soon and
[12:32] um I told Billy I said the Bible did say
[12:35] multiply and replenish the Earth but the
[12:37] whole burden wasn't given to you and
[12:41] his grandsons are appearing fast and so
[12:44] remember my daughter-in-law was Barren
[12:47] to begin with she could not have no
[12:50] children and one day leaving the meeting
[12:52] the Lord spoke ten minutes at lost you
[12:55] will bear son
[12:57] the Lord has bless you your female
[12:59] trouble is gone
[13:01] little Paul was born nine months later
[13:04] two months before this baby come on the
[13:06] scene I was sitting eating breakfast one
[13:08] morning at the table and lost and Billy
[13:11] was sitting across the table from me and
[13:13] I seen Lois
[13:15] feeding a little baby with a Pete or a
[13:19] blue blanket wrapped around it and Billy
[13:22] was sitting in the corner feeding little
[13:24] Paul I said Billy I just saw a vision
[13:27] Lois was feeding a baby wrapped in a
[13:30] blue blanket he said there goes my
[13:31] hunting trip that's just nine months
[13:33] from now
[13:35] assistant
[13:37] 11 months later Little David was born
[13:41] and I haven't been able to dedicate him
[13:44] to the Lord yet and will not until we
[13:48] return again so you see what it is how I
[13:51] love people in their Fellowship but our
[13:53] Brethren has been praying for the sake
[13:54] and I know it's a success each night we
[13:58] prayed for the sick one laying your
[14:00] hands on the other all of us together
[14:01] which that way catches the whole scope
[14:04] but maybe if God willing I'll mark it on
[14:07] the card if we send it coming back I'd
[14:10] like to dedicate about two or three days
[14:12] again just to praying for the sake and
[14:15] doing what we can in that manner now
[14:19] I thank the people for their help again
[14:21] now I just want to comment just a moment
[14:26] on the
[14:27] on the morning's message there's no
[14:31] doubt I didn't get completely true with
[14:34] it but I think you understand
[14:37] and I'm sure you didn't you never know
[14:41] what that was for me to do now it seems
[14:46] very simple to you but you should see
[14:48] what you're doing you're taking the
[14:50] place of God to pronounce something
[14:53] and before I would do that it had become
[14:55] an answer from God
[14:57] and he had to come down and he visibly
[14:59] showed himself and gave the revelation
[15:02] therefore
[15:04] see this is to the church and remember I
[15:06] said these this what I said was to the
[15:08] church only and so that you might have
[15:11] confidence and know that was the same
[15:13] God
[15:14] that said to me up there or there was no
[15:17] squirrel
[15:18] speak and say where they'll be and three
[15:21] straight times that happened now if he
[15:23] can buy that same word create something
[15:26] that isn't there how much more will this
[15:29] hold fast at the day of judgment
[15:31] yeah
[15:33] people were there to see these things
[15:34] and no as Paul said in the days gone by
[15:39] there's a man with him who who felt the
[15:42] Earth shake and didn't hear the voice
[15:44] but they they seen the the pillar of
[15:46] farm
[15:48] the dummy good old actual is over to see
[15:51] husbands and wives that I know as
[15:53] genuine Christians hugging one another
[15:55] and weeping
[15:58] listen friends
[16:00] God confirms this word with signs and
[16:03] vindications that prove that it's right
[16:06] spoken word
[16:09] now
[16:11] remember that light that was in that
[16:14] cloud
[16:15] they gave the revelation
[16:17] my little girl was telling me Sarah here
[16:19] that when they at that school there in
[16:22] Arizona was looking out there on a
[16:23] cloudy sky and seeing this Cloud
[16:25] mysteriously and that mountain going up
[16:28] and down with an Amber fire burning in
[16:30] it the teacher dismissed the classes in
[16:33] the school and brought him out front
[16:34] said did you ever see anything like that
[16:37] look away that's it remember that's that
[16:39] same amber light that's on the rock
[16:43] so it's the same God
[16:46] same revelation
[16:48] said tell them to do this is what I told
[16:51] you this morning so there it is
[16:54] if it happens to be that my good friend
[16:56] brother Roy Roberson is listening into
[17:00] Tucson
[17:01] Roy
[17:03] you remember the other day the vision
[17:05] you've seen when we were out
[17:08] standing up on the mountain you come up
[17:10] to me and that cloud was over the top
[17:12] come walking down your heart he told you
[17:14] I told you at the house of the day
[17:16] that's it Roy

[17:41] happy continue that way don't never do
[17:44] anything wrong again like that
[17:46] just go ahead it's God's grace

[19:50] dear gracious God
[19:53] this little note here of a few things to
[19:56] say to the people and back again to
[19:59] refer back to this morning for that's
[20:02] what the people come to hear
[20:04] I pray God that you'll let the people
[20:06] see that God loves and cares
[20:10] and it was not me that give that Lord it
[20:14] was Vindicated it was the truth
[20:17] so I pray dear God that your love will
[20:20] always remain among the people tonight
[20:23] to have to separate after this meeting
[20:25] and go to our different homes
[20:27] it kind of pulls some deep Lord
[20:31] I pray that you'll bless these people
[20:33] now as we approach the word
[20:36] in prayer and approach the written word
[20:39] we ask that you will take this written
[20:42] word
[20:44] and make it alive to us tonight
[20:48] and when we leave this building tonight
[20:50] to separate to go to our different homes
[20:52] may we say like those who came from
[20:55] Emmaus
[20:57] that had walked with him all day and
[21:00] still didn't know him but when he got
[21:02] him inside the room that night the doors
[21:05] all shut he did something just like he
[21:09] did before his crucifixion by that they
[21:12] know he had risen again
[21:15] do it again tonight Lord
[21:17] granted while the doors are shut and
[21:20] your little group here is setting
[21:21] waiting father when we go to our homes
[21:25] we'll say like they did did not our
[21:27] hearts burn within us
[21:29] as he talked to us along the way
[21:34] we commit ourselves and all in your
[21:37] hands Lord do with us as you see fifth
[21:39] in Jesus name amen
[21:43] now
[21:45] let's get right into the service Now
[21:47] quickly turning now with me if you will
[21:50] to the book of Hebrews
[21:55] and another
[21:56] Revelation on the message we'll speak
[22:00] for just a few moments tonight the Lord
[22:02] willing
[22:04] and then
[22:06] while reading the first
[22:09] three verses of Hebrews 7 1-3
[22:15] and then commenting on this and we don't
[22:18] know what the Lord will do
[22:21] we do not know the only thing we do is
[22:24] just believe watch pray that right
[22:30] and believe that he'll make everything
[22:32] work together for good to them it loves
[22:35] him because he promised to amen
[22:43] for this milk
[22:45] Cassidy
[22:47] king of Salem priest of the most high
[22:49] God
[22:51] who met Abraham returning from the
[22:53] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[22:56] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[23:00] of all first being by interpretation
[23:04] king of righteousness
[23:07] and after that also king of Salem which
[23:12] is
[23:13] king of Peace let's read a little
[23:16] farther
[23:17] without father without mother without
[23:20] the sin
[23:22] neither beginning of days are end of
[23:26] life
[23:27] but made like unto the Son of God about
[23:29] it the priest continually
[23:35] think of this great person
[23:39] of how great this man must be
[23:44] and now the question is who is this man
[23:51] theologians has had different ideas
[23:54] but since the opening of The Seven Seals
[23:57] the mysterious book
[23:59] that's been mysterious to us according
[24:02] to Revelations 10 1-7 all the Mysteries
[24:08] that's wrote in this book that's been
[24:10] hid down through the age of the
[24:12] reformers is supposed to be brought out
[24:16] into view by the angel of the last
[24:19] churches
[24:21] how many knows that's right
[24:24] supposed to be brought all the mysteries
[24:27] of the mysterious book is to be revealed
[24:30] to the lady osia messenger
[24:33] of that age
[24:35] see there is much dispute about this
[24:37] person
[24:39] and this subject
[24:41] I think it behooves us to break into it
[24:44] to find out who this is now there's
[24:47] several schools of thought on him
[24:50] one of the schools are claims is just a
[24:53] myth
[24:55] he wasn't actually a person
[24:58] and the others says that it was a
[25:02] priesthood
[25:03] that was a male chesidic priesthood
[25:06] that's the most likely one that whole
[25:09] better to that side than they do to the
[25:11] other is because they say it was a
[25:14] priesthood
[25:15] it can't be that
[25:18] for in the fourth verse it says he was a
[25:22] person
[25:24] a man
[26:03] think of this great person
[26:07] of how great this man must be
[26:13] and now the question is who is this man
[26:20] theologians has had different ideas
[26:22] but since the opening of The Seven Seals
[26:25] the mysterious book
[26:27] that's been mysterious to us according
[26:31] to Revelations 10 1-7
[26:34] all the Mysteries that's wrote in this

[27:44] it can't be that
[27:46] for in the fourth verse it says he was a
[27:51] person
[27:52] a man
[27:54] so in order to be a person he has to be
[27:56] a personality
[27:58] a man
[28:00] not an order but a person
[28:03] so he was not just a priesthood order
[28:07] neither was he a myth he was a person
[28:11] and the person is eternal
[28:16] if you notice he had no father
[28:19] he had no mother
[28:21] he had no time he ever began
[28:23] and he had no time he ever ended
[28:27] and ever who it was is still alive
[28:30] tonight
[28:32] because the Bible said here that he had
[28:35] neither father nor mother
[28:38] getting of days are ending of life
[28:43] so it would have to be an eternal person
[28:47] is that wrong
[28:49] an eternal person
[28:51] so it could only be one person that's
[28:54] God because he's the only one that's
[28:57] eternal
[28:58] God now in first Timothy 6 15 and 16 if
[29:03] you'd like to read that sometime I'd
[29:05] like for you to read it
[29:07] now the thing that I contend is that he
[29:12] was God
[29:14] because he's the only person that can be
[29:17] immortal
[29:19] and now God changing himself
[29:22] into person
[29:25] that's what he wants
[29:27] no father no mother no beginning in life
[29:29] no entering of days
[29:31] now
