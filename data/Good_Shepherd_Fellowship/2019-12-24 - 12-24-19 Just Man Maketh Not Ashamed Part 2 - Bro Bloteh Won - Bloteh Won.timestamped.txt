[14:02] [Music]
[19:34] [Applause]
[19:38] [Music]
[19:42] you know brothers and sisters I you know
[19:47] the week that I've had and it seems it
[19:49] doesn't stop there and every time I
[19:52] called to come and lead songs I get all
[19:56] nervous and I started out of tune and
[19:59] know what I'm gonna play playing eggs or
[20:02] what but you know all in all I when I
[20:06] come up here I I try to pull my heart
[20:10] for him because you know he's done a lot
[20:15] for us and he continues to do a lot for
[20:18] us it's everyday you know it's a battle
[20:21] you know I know today I was sitting
[20:24] there you know that like I mentioned to
[20:27] you this this week and I my my children
[20:30] and my wife are not serving the Lord
[20:33] right now that she stays home she's a
[20:36] good wife but you know I like I told you
[20:39] on Sunday I believe that she'll come
[20:41] through these doors one day I'm still
[20:43] claiming them you know and I was talking
[20:46] to her today and I had a thought today
[20:48] that dad how God created us to her to
[20:56] his image you know and I and I said to
[20:59] her you know I'm gonna prove to you that
[21:02] that you are just and or you have the
[21:08] same characteristic that God has
[21:12] and I said I said - I started asking her
[21:16] a question I said to her are you
[21:17] merciful she said yes I am
[21:21] it's always God so is the Lord are you
[21:24] kind so is the Lord are you loving so is
[21:26] the Lord you know and I I was just
[21:30] bringing out courage the reflux of the
[21:33] Lord
[21:34] and you know and I brought her back to
[21:38] the Garden of Eden when God created man
[21:43] to His image
[21:45] why wouldn't be like unto him when he
[21:50] said I have created you to my image so
[21:52] he put those attributes there in you to
[21:56] be able to believe and to be able to
[21:59] bring forth love mercy all those gifts
[22:02] that he has you have them to because
[22:06] you're part of him there's no way around
[22:09] it there's no way you can hide the world
[22:13] can deny it
[22:15] but we're part of him it's up to you to
[22:20] accept that
[22:21] you know and she looked at me and she
[22:23] said you know that makes sense to me you
[22:24] know well remember Jesus when he was
[22:28] contending with the Pharisees when
[22:31] accused him of being God and he stood
[22:37] there in incest and brought the
[22:38] scriptures he said doesn't the scripture
[22:42] say that your God so if we we are
[22:47] created as His image we are like but
[22:51] here's here's the here's the deal
[22:53] the only problem right now is that we're
[22:56] in a falling condition we don't have our
[22:59] full attributes
[23:03] expressing out and he had to come to
[23:09] give us that he had to come to give us
[23:12] that that was the only way we were gonna
[23:15] receive it but he knew who was and who
[23:18] was not gonna see
[23:20] that's the wonder overall and I'm
[23:24] grateful to that I'm just grateful that
[23:28] he called me from the foundations of the
[23:31] world that he called you for the Steve
[23:33] mr. Kelly brothers and sisters but you
[23:39] have to believe it you have to accept it
[23:41] by faith remember the story of the young
[23:44] or the man who went to the gallows
[23:46] because he deserted I know brother
[23:48] Brennan spoke about that and they went
[23:51] up to President Lincoln to get his
[23:53] pardon president he just took a little
[23:56] paper and just wrote it down just just
[23:59] think of it pardon so-and-so take it to
[24:01] him you know
[24:04] he took it to him and he said no I don't
[24:07] believe that I don't believe that in the
[24:08] next day
[24:09] simple simple how about her brothers and
[24:14] sisters when he was walking in Galilee
[24:17] [Music]
[24:31] the party came to you
[24:34] did you see it and did you accept it no
[24:41] wonderful
[24:42] it was just simple simple as that
[24:46] God in simplicity brother Ramsey he
[24:50] always comes when you never when you
[24:53] never expect him to and it's simple as
[24:57] he can come it's up to you to recognize
[25:00] him
[25:01] but you know what thank the Lord that
[25:05] only the bride can recognize him he said
[25:10] the row can't see me but you
[25:15] counted a privilege and a blessing that
[25:18] you can
[25:22] [Music]
[25:30] rather you can come and pick up the
[25:32] offering brother yes
[25:35] [Music]

[45:47] realizing that he's flying out on Sunday
[45:51] evening so we asked buddy Danny to
[45:56] preach for us again on Sunday praise the
[45:58] Lord
[45:59] he realized that he did not finish his
[46:04] message I saw him for tea his notes he
[46:06] may praise the Lord
[46:08] so he could preach the rest of the 12
[46:12] copies that is left praise the Lord we
[46:21] start Wednesday last Wednesday night
[46:23] speaking on just men make up matter
[46:26] shame and we were actually talking about
[46:31] from the house of shame to the house of
[46:34] testimony and then we try to bring
[46:37] Joseph into this whole situation of
[46:40] shame
[46:42] praise the Lord so he's the just man
[46:44] that we were talking about praise the
[46:47] Lord as the scripture said Joseph was a
[46:49] just man and as I chapter 9 verse 6 has
[46:56] been one of my favorite Christmas
[46:58] message I love to speak on their verse
[47:03] and since the grace of God a lot helped
[47:09] me to be able to see something in a
[47:11] verse I goes back to it over and over to
[47:14] remind myself around this time of the
[47:17] year praise the Lord Amen that the
[47:22] scripture says unto us a child is born
[47:27] and on to us a son is given
[47:33] praise the Lord what a promise I mean
[47:39] their promise hosts a whole lot of God
[47:46] playing of redemption it was a whole lot
[47:49] of what God been doing throughout all
[47:52] the ages and there's a lot of mystery in
[47:56] there brothers is a kind of a rebalance
[47:59] year
[48:00] and so I like to go back to death every
[48:08] time we come around this time because
[48:11] you know before the prophet of God
[48:14] taught us in and I mean what he brought
[48:17] out of the scripture we can help but to
[48:20] refer back to this all the time
[48:23] amen unto us a child is born and on to
[48:28] us a son is given
[48:30] it's it's pitiful that the entire
[48:35] religious word is kind of a stuck with
[48:38] the child that is born amen
[48:42] they are all stuck with the child that
[48:45] is born they remember the child that is
[48:48] born but a child that was born was just
[48:51] a vehicle to bring us the son that is
[48:55] giving praise the Lord the child I was
[49:02] born was just a vehicle to bring to us
[49:06] the son that is giving because it's in
[49:10] the son that there is life amen
[49:15] the child was just assisting element
[49:19] body like every other system element
[49:23] body but in their child was a son that
[49:28] was given and Jesus himself ins in John
[49:33] chapter 6 he said this let's read that
[49:37] together just before I get into what I
[49:40] want to talk about tonight praise the
[49:45] Lord
[49:46] it's in John chapter 6
[50:00] and you realize you know all through
[50:04] Jesus ministry he talks about you know
[50:07] the Sun he talks about the Father he
[50:10] talks about the Sun and he said the son
[50:14] can do nothing in himself but what the
[50:17] father has shown him you know in order
[50:20] death jesus said in john chapter 6 verse
[50:24] 40
[50:38] verse 39 he says and and this is the
[50:43] Father's will which have sent me that of
[50:49] all which he has given me I should lose
[50:53] nothing but she raised it up again at
[50:58] the last day and this is the will of him
[51:04] that sent me that every one wish see
[51:10] read the Son and believeth on him praise
[51:18] the Lord
[51:19] how everlasting life you realize that
[51:25] Jesus knew very well you know what
[51:29] Isaiah the prophet prophesied and there
[51:35] was no word in his ministry where he may
[51:38] reference to the child that was born but
[51:42] he spoke more often of the son praise
[51:48] the Lord because it's in the son that
[51:52] there was life praise the Lord it holds
[51:59] a great deal of the Godhead for us and
[52:04] it holds our representation and it holds
[52:07] you know Jesus said he the theory of the
[52:11] son amen
[52:15] and believe it he that is able to
[52:18] identify the Son and believe it on him
[52:22] has everlasting life and I will raise
[52:25] him up in the last day
[52:28] praise the Lord unto us a child is born
[52:33] a known to us a son is given
[52:38] praise the Lord
[52:42] but we just used there tonight since
[52:45] it's my favorite team around this time
[52:48] but I want to go right back into it just
[52:50] man that maketh nourishing praise the
[52:54] Lord
[52:55] where Branham over in God identify his
[52:58] character racist identified by his
[53:00] characteristics he said this about
[53:02] Joseph because now Joseph was a just man
[53:09] he was a good man
[53:12] and no doubt Mary had told him they
[53:20] ain't told him the visit of Gabriel and
[53:24] how dare she was to be overshadowed by
[53:28] the Holy Spirit and was to conceive and
[53:33] to bear a son and his name was to be
[53:37] called Jesus how dare she must have told
[53:42] that to Joseph and Joseph could look in
[53:49] her big brown eyes and he could see the
[53:55] innocent of it and he wanted to believe
[53:59] that he wanted to believe it with all of
[54:03] his heart yet it was too unusual and he
[54:10] was minded to put her away privily now
[54:15] if a man is sincere in it God will make
[54:22] some way to show that man that is true
[54:27] he's obligated if you are sincere God is
[54:34] obligated praise the Lord
[54:36] if you see it and walk away from a then
[54:40] you are to be judged but if you are
[54:43] sincere and see the truth now Joseph was
[54:47] was was just minded he said it's so
[54:52] unusual now last week we read
[54:55] another code where brother branham
[54:56] he and a mirror had just read this very
[55:00] promise that we read in the Book of
[55:02] Isaiah amen
[55:05] reading through the straw they have just
[55:07] read it nananana and and I started
[55:10] thinking about their today and how many
[55:13] times you know we we we read a promise
[55:16] of God and I mean right from the Word of
[55:20] God all from the back of the pulpit or
[55:23] listening to a tape and and and you can
[55:25] you can see the promise of God but just
[55:28] at the time that God would do it I mean
[55:32] and it's all is it's almost like Moses
[55:37] standing on the rock and asking God I
[55:40] want to see your glory pray so long
[55:45] amen and God who come and tell Moses I'm
[55:50] going to pass by but no man see me and
[55:55] live praise the Lord brother Branham
[56:01] says it's always after God has brought
[56:04] his word to pass it's always after he
[56:10] has passed that we can see his backside
[56:15] praise the Lord
[56:18] we'll be trusting God for healing in our
[56:22] body praise the Lord and trusting God
[56:26] for different things and and and and and
[56:28] just that moment the very moment that
[56:31] very meaning that God who do that thing
[56:34] it's always in the place where he put
[56:37] his hands over our eyes he brings the
[56:39] healing in our body or answer to our
[56:42] prayer then it has to take a little
[56:44] while for us to look back and say oh he
[56:47] has done it
[56:51] praise the Lord it's hard to catch God
[56:55] in the at
[56:57] praise the Lord amen he does it all the
[57:03] time before we realized that he have
[57:06] done it they have just read this promise
[57:13] in the word and they were talking about
[57:16] and it says so
[57:17] wow what a promise a virgin shall
[57:20] conceive and right before his eyes he
[57:22] knew that his wife was a virgin praise
[57:27] the Lord and God bring the world to pass
[57:30] by but Bob right before him is unusual
[57:35] what if the Virgin will conceive now my
[57:38] virgin praise the Lord and now he's he's
[57:45] thinking about it
[57:47] he believed Mary because he has trusted
[57:51] her praise the Lord
[57:54] but this is the first time for him to
[57:56] walk into a reality of the Word of God
[58:05] praise the Lord you see it is so easy
[58:08] for us to listening to the word all the
[58:10] time but when God starts to make that
[58:14] word flesh which is the ultimate desire
[58:19] of God is to make his world flesh praise
[58:27] the Lord and then we start thinking
[58:31] about I was thinking about that today
[58:33] you know what we we read in the
[58:36] stricture the Bible talks about the
[58:38] trial of our faith but every time trial
[58:43] comes it's hard for us to see right
[58:46] there that is the trial of our faith
[58:51] praise the Lord
[58:54] it's easier for us to read in Scripture
[58:56] and you know then that God loved he
[59:00] tried praise the Lord we read there we
[59:04] can say Amen to the Word of God praise
[59:08] the Lord we can be thinking about it
[59:11] preparing ourself for the triumph but
[59:13] when the Trier comes on the scene it
[59:17] looks like we have a flat tire yet
[59:19] tonight
[59:22] praise the Lord glory be to God Amen we
[59:31] have to know that God ultimate desire is
[59:34] to make his word flesh in us praise the
[59:39] Lord God is not satisfied of how much a
[59:43] brand-new Bible you carry he now
[59:45] satisfied of how many times you read the
[59:47] Bible in the day and what his desire is
[59:50] is for His Word to be made flesh in you
[59:54] and myself praise the Lord he told Moses
[1:00:00] build me a tabernacle I want to come
[1:00:02] down and dwell with my people
[1:00:09] praise the Lord amen so later Joseph
[1:00:18] year thinking about this how could this
[1:00:21] be
[1:00:21] man I mean we got into the drama of
[1:00:25] their last week and I mean every
[1:00:28] newspaper Karen earring you know what
[1:00:30] everybody comes to Jacob workshop that's
[1:00:33] what I want to talk about and I mean he
[1:00:37] was just he was just caught between the
[1:00:39] mountains and the Red Sea
[1:00:41] praise the Lord but as the scripture
[1:00:45] said he was a just man he was not going
[1:00:49] to make a public short about this amen
[1:00:52] and as he was thinking it in his heart
[1:00:54] the Bible says and that night the very
[1:00:57] same angel came together
[1:00:59] I mean came the angel Gabriel came to
[1:01:01] Joseph and told him there this thing is
[1:01:04] done by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord
[1:01:08] and I believe when when Joseph woke up
[1:01:13] that day he was ready to bear the
[1:01:16] reproach of the word praise the Lord
[1:01:20] now this is the greatest gift the Sun
[1:01:23] that is giving
[1:01:24] it's in the Sun that there escape this
[1:01:28] is God's own life praise the Lord the
[1:01:34] Bible says and God made man in His image
[1:01:37] and breath into man and he became a
[1:01:40] living soul brother Branham says he was
[1:01:42] an amateur God praise the Lord the Bible
[1:01:49] says and God made man and then he rested
[1:01:55] praise the Lord
[1:01:57] wish of course we know that it was not
[1:02:00] just a natural rest or taking a nap it
[1:02:05] was God dwelling in his son it was God
[1:02:10] taking a form of the very man that he
[1:02:14] has created it was God homely himself to
[1:02:19] the body that he has made praise the
[1:02:24] Lord that God would trust his work to
[1:02:29] the hands of his own creature praise the
[1:02:34] Lord Amen he birthed in two men he man
[1:02:39] became a living soul that was the breath
[1:02:42] of God God's own life oh yeah he had to
[1:02:48] have a son in his image he had to have a
[1:02:52] man to protect the things that he have
[1:02:55] created Adam was put in a garden as an
[1:02:58] amateur god amen
[1:03:01] he had a work to name all the animals in
[1:03:04] and I mean he was he was there as as a
[1:03:08] protection to the work of God to
[1:03:13] everything that God made he was he was
[1:03:15] having dominion over it
[1:03:19] praise the Lord
[1:03:22] this is to say 2:19 and that's what we
[1:03:25] were going last week when God gave His
[1:03:28] Word God raised of men
[1:03:32] to protect that word praise the Lord
[1:03:39] this Psalm that was going to be giving
[1:03:41] God was more interested in the Sun than
[1:03:46] the child amen because the Sun was gift
[1:03:52] just like Jesus said to the woman at the
[1:03:55] word if you know he won't to have spoken
[1:03:58] unto you that was the gift of God that
[1:04:05] was the gift of life for God so loved
[1:04:07] the world that He gave His only begotten
[1:04:10] Son
[1:04:14] praise the Lord that God would trust you
[1:04:20] and myself praise the Lord
[1:04:26] just like Paul said to make us steel
[1:04:29] walls of his mystery to make a steel
[1:04:34] wall of his life in God's mind he knew
[1:04:41] it was going to be married and he never
[1:04:45] allowed her to fall in love with any
[1:04:48] kind of a novice just a young boy praise
[1:04:51] the Lord they have his his feet on his
[1:04:54] shoulders praise the Lord
[1:04:59] and this Joseph was a widow all his wife
[1:05:03] passed away he has been there just like
[1:05:05] I said you have raised children he know
[1:05:09] what it is God got a man seizing that's
[1:05:13] why he had to bring us through seven
[1:05:15] Church ages because he wanted people
[1:05:19] seasoned mentor and people that can take
[1:05:26] the reproach of the world
[1:05:28] now goals that would back away when they
[1:05:31] start talking about the crime out dog
[1:05:33] that we back away when people can find
[1:05:37] one foot or another fun trace the Lord
[1:05:43] I just meant making that a shame when
[1:05:51] just have got a witness
[1:05:53] it was Ned a passed down experience the
[1:05:58] angel visited to him that night the
[1:06:02] angel spoke to his heart
[1:06:05] praise the Lord amen and with that
[1:06:10] experience he was willing to take the
[1:06:15] reproach he was willing to protect that
[1:06:21] life that is amazing that brother
[1:06:24] Branham says something here in physical
[1:06:28] union we've been clean that through the
[1:06:31] tens giving weekend and I read that all
[1:06:35] the time he says now I'm speaking now
[1:06:41] bringing this to an illustration to show
[1:06:44] you where the church stands I'm not
[1:06:50] speaking of you women but I'm speaking
[1:06:53] of the church and Christ
[1:06:55] now this she is giving to brave for life
[1:07:00] their only God amen that only God can
[1:07:08] give praise alone this she is giving to
[1:07:15] bring for life and when a God Himself
[1:07:21] can give her Hosmer might be the gem
[1:07:26] bear but God has to produce the life
[1:07:29] all life comes from God and her life has
[1:07:34] to comes from God
[1:07:35] praise the Lord he says now
[1:07:42] she has sacred one I want to name three
[1:07:47] things here that she must net get away
[1:07:51] from praise the Lord I'm I'm speaking
[1:07:59] keep the church in mind what I'm
[1:08:01] speaking this to the natural woman
[1:08:05] praise the Lord we went over this praise
[1:08:10] Lord that is a stranger as we as you
[1:08:16] follow me a little bit and see how
[1:08:17] brother Branham tied this thing right in
[1:08:20] to Joseph and Mary's life amen so just
[1:08:26] like the proper God says she was giving
[1:08:32] these things for redemption praise the
[1:08:38] Lord and that was the thing that Adam
[1:08:42] was supposed to protect that is the
[1:08:49] thing that a man's supposed to protect
[1:08:56] because sons and daughters of God people
[1:09:01] that God will use India generation will
[1:09:05] be born by parents the scripture said
[1:09:08] train up a child in a way that will grow
[1:09:10] then when they get all they will not
[1:09:12] depart from it praise the Lord
[1:09:15] and then we have our children just like
[1:09:18] the little one we dedicate tonight
[1:09:20] lovely little baby but God has a purpose
[1:09:23] God has a gift in the life of that
[1:09:26] little baby praise the Lord
[1:09:31] so as a parent we have the
[1:09:34] responsibility to be able to guide that
[1:09:36] little life to protect it just like how
[1:09:39] Joseph had a responsibility to protect
[1:09:42] Mary and that's what he was raised up
[1:09:45] for just imagine everything he went
[1:09:49] through in his life he had his first
[1:09:52] wife he had training where his first
[1:09:55] five praise the Lord he loved her to
[1:09:59] death his children he did every but God
[1:10:02] was preparing him to be a protector
[1:10:08] praise the Lord
[1:10:09] so that gift that was coming in would
[1:10:13] praise Lord realized the religious world
[1:10:18] was against it
[1:10:20] Herod the King was against it so the
[1:10:24] religious world was against it the
[1:10:26] political world was against it praise
[1:10:31] the Lord
[1:10:32] and the people was so busy during their
[1:10:37] time of taxation that there was no even
[1:10:41] no room praise the Lord
[1:10:46] so Joseph was now only facing their
[1:10:50] religious word the Pharisees or
[1:10:53] Sadducees or the Sanhedrin Council there
[1:10:56] was a word also from Herod the King to
[1:10:59] get the child praise the Lord
[1:11:03] as he was travelling everywhere I was so
[1:11:06] busy there was no room in a name he had
[1:11:12] to be with the the the economy of that
[1:11:15] day so the political system the
[1:11:21] religious system the economic system
[1:11:24] everything was against their word but he
[1:11:29] was raising up God rose him up God
[1:11:32] trained him by all the trials that he
[1:11:35] went through everything that he went
[1:11:37] through and he thought it was just his
[1:11:40] natural life God trained him to bring
[1:11:43] him to that moment
[1:11:45] because the gift of life the body that
[1:11:49] God has prepared to come among men to
[1:11:53] become flesh was giving and he to
[1:11:57] protect it praise the Lord
[1:12:05] and that's the same responsibility we
[1:12:08] have been giving praise the Lord this
[1:12:15] salvation is gospel life this grace that
[1:12:22] we have received is God's own life he
[1:12:30] has brought us in all of our ways of
[1:12:32] life in everything that we went through
[1:12:34] just for this movie
[1:12:36] praise the Lord just for this moment
[1:12:39] when the entire verse system is against
[1:12:42] this we know everything that is building
[1:12:47] up in politics and everything that is
[1:12:49] building up in a religious word and even
[1:12:51] the economy of the word it's all coming
[1:12:54] against this life of Christ praise the
[1:13:01] Lord
[1:13:11] and God raised up Joseph for this very
[1:13:14] reason let's read a little bit yeah
[1:13:16] better Branham continuing he speaks of
[1:13:19] four years in the seventh chapter of
[1:13:22] Romans she has a sacred trust or virtue
[1:13:28] committed to her by God nothing s horse
[1:13:33] it bought the woman praise the Lord
[1:13:40] just the same as the church that there
[1:13:45] has been married to the Lord has to come
[1:13:48] also before Christ before the second
[1:13:53] marriage as she she has to confess there
[1:13:57] if she she doesn't and she lay with her
[1:14:01] husband even ten years and then confess
[1:14:03] it she has a right to be put away that's
[1:14:08] the scripture fornication is on clean
[1:14:10] living now he brings Joseph into the
[1:14:13] story Joseph fear ner to take on today
[1:14:18] married a wife for that which is
[1:14:21] conceived in her praise the Lord now you
[1:14:26] read the Old Testament and many people
[1:14:31] who think that the Old Testament was so
[1:14:34] hard on women praise the Lord and that's
[1:14:39] how they will look at it why why did God
[1:14:47] place it like that is because she had
[1:14:50] this sacred trust in her it was not that
[1:14:54] the Old Testament were hard and we mean
[1:14:56] the law was protecting the gift of life
[1:15:03] because God will has to come true
[1:15:07] the blustering brother Branham says in
[1:15:11] the Old Testament he had to purify the
[1:15:14] blood strain here there was no mix of
[1:15:17] blood because Almighty God was going to
[1:15:19] ride through the blood stream to become
[1:15:23] flesh
[1:15:26] so he'll a it can in his household had
[1:15:31] to be burned and and I mean everything
[1:15:33] that was like like a mix go we have to
[1:15:36] cut it off he was protecting that
[1:15:38] bloodstream and that is the same thing
[1:15:44] the woman was in a type of praise the
[1:15:50] Lord because she was said to be
[1:15:53] protecting where Branham says she was to
[1:15:58] bring forth life the only thing that God
[1:16:02] Himself can gave praise the Lord because
[1:16:09] she was to be the life giver where
[1:16:16] Benham go ahead he says and because she
[1:16:20] was cast over the other side she has
[1:16:25] also been given the sacred trash from
[1:16:29] God for redemption the seed of the woman
[1:16:36] will bruise the head of the setting so
[1:16:39] God gave her the promise of redemption
[1:16:42] the sacred trust of it was because the
[1:16:48] Redeemer was going to come true so she
[1:16:53] needed to be protected
[1:16:57] praise the Lord
[1:17:00] Peter come up and he caused a woman a
[1:17:03] weaker vessel Paul guess alone and he
[1:17:12] says God has poured heaven a treasure in
[1:17:15] empty vessel and all of those things
[1:17:19] I play out all through the scripture
[1:17:22] through the life and ministry of
[1:17:24] Jeremiah and all the different ones
[1:17:27] praise the Lord that God will put his
[1:17:31] antenna plane
[1:17:36] in our broken lives amen our broken
[1:17:43] lives in and in all of our mistakes and
[1:17:45] and in all of the trials and trouble
[1:17:48] that we would go through but down in
[1:17:49] that soul that's a gem of life
[1:17:53] God's own life praise the Lord and
[1:18:00] that's the reason why in every age God
[1:18:05] will raise up a man and he would give
[1:18:08] him a word you would give him a mini
[1:18:10] strength praise the Lord and that
[1:18:17] ministry will be there to guide the way
[1:18:20] to the Tree of Life that ministry will
[1:18:23] be there to be able to guide to protect
[1:18:26] that life that God has ordained for that
[1:18:29] age
[1:18:33] praise the Lord
[1:18:35] Joseph had to protect Mary and that's
[1:18:40] the reason why it's in a marriage
[1:18:41] covenant that's the work of the man he's
[1:18:45] there to protect his wife because
[1:18:50] marriage is a mystery praise the Lord
[1:18:56] it's a mystery and God only gave this
[1:19:03] responsibility to just man amen we know
[1:19:09] just men and that men that don't have
[1:19:14] mistakes praise the Lord
[1:19:19] just men are earnest men just men a man
[1:19:23] that can own up to their mistakes praise
[1:19:27] the Lord I believe if the scripture if
[1:19:30] you please go to put in the scripture
[1:19:33] that Joseph was thinking to put married
[1:19:35] away probably the Word of God expose
[1:19:40] reveal his heart
[1:19:43] and I believe that Joseph was earnest
[1:19:46] about it to tell Mary what he was
[1:19:48] thinking if God who revealed in his word
[1:19:53] it was not difficult for him to talk
[1:19:55] about it praise the Lord amen that's a
[1:20:01] just man he's an earnest man this is
[1:20:03] this is where I was I was confused but
[1:20:09] it took God to come down and dissolve my
[1:20:11] doubts just man I met I'm not ashamed
[1:20:16] when they are struggling I mean the
[1:20:22] another team when they are struggling to
[1:20:23] admit that I'm strongly I need help
[1:20:26] or God I believe that's the place where
[1:20:28] Joseph was he was saying all God I need
[1:20:32] help you know I love Mary with all of my
[1:20:35] heart I need help and when you cry to
[1:20:39] God for help like that help is on its
[1:20:42] way God will surely give you help
[1:20:48] praise the Lord
[1:20:49] oh just man I'm not ashamed when when
[1:20:53] the field to admit that they have failed
[1:21:03] just men are now seamless man no just
[1:21:12] men are now seamless me just many men
[1:21:18] that makes mistake but the owner to
[1:21:20] their mistakes they admit when they are
[1:21:22] wrong and they ask for help when they
[1:21:25] need help
[1:21:29] praise the Lord
[1:21:30] barber says Joseph was sincere amen
[1:21:37] he said he wasn't here
[1:21:42] because this was unusual praise the Lord
[1:21:47] trials are unusual that's the reason why
[1:21:53] when a hit or we get confused and the
[1:21:55] first thing we start to check our life
[1:21:57] were where we where we have seen it and
[1:22:00] what has gone wrong and in law what I've
[1:22:02] had done and and it's hard for us in the
[1:22:05] first instant to say thank you Lord for
[1:22:07] the tribe yeah
[1:22:10] praise the Lord amen
[1:22:13] if you ever did that you made that up
[1:22:21] praise the Lord God use these tries to
[1:22:33] build characters for just me praise the
[1:22:39] Lord
[1:22:40] just imagine Joseph wept over the
[1:22:45] passing of his wife it took him a while
[1:22:48] for him to get over it to be able to
[1:22:53] trust another woman with his heart and
[1:22:57] just in that time prison water it takes
[1:23:06] heart rires to prepare us to be just man
[1:23:14] in situations to stand with this world
[1:23:18] to stand for Christ in a situation
[1:23:24] praise the Lord
[1:23:26] young people that's what God is looking
[1:23:28] for he's looking for just men just men
[1:23:36] make it nourishing
[1:23:42] he stood with Mary he better approach
[1:23:48] praise the Lord he was ready to defend
[1:23:51] her I believe there were time were they
[1:23:59] were angry religious crowd ready to
[1:24:04] stone her to death and Joseph would say
[1:24:08] over my dead body
[1:24:09] I have to be there first
[1:24:14] praise the Lord one time there was a
[1:24:17] just man that a woman in that daughter
[1:24:19] rental amen the Cora in a daughter she
[1:24:25] rented that just man he looked him in
[1:24:30] the eyes and he said which one him own
[1:24:34] you have not seen praise the Lord
[1:24:40] it takes a just man to make those balls
[1:24:43] take me glory be to God I believe that's
[1:24:56] the hour we are in church as we go
[1:25:01] through this season of Christmas and you
[1:25:08] know we think about the gift of life
[1:25:13] that was giving but also think about the
[1:25:16] protection that God has put around this
[1:25:20] he has given us five for ministry to
[1:25:25] protect this world he has given us nine
[1:25:28] spiritual gift to protect this world he
[1:25:32] has even given us seven angels seven
[1:25:37] angels just to protect this world not
[1:25:43] sure how sacred God word is they mean
[1:25:49] they're sure that is not is not from a
[1:25:52] Bible School it's not just at
[1:25:56] geological reasoning is God's own life
[1:26:03] praise the Lord it's God's own life just
[1:26:09] imagine when when irony either fell he
[1:26:13] placed two cherubim to guide the Tree of
[1:26:17] Life
[1:26:19] amen because that was representing his
[1:26:23] life
[1:26:24] God always protect his life his
[1:26:32] protection his mercy His grace his
[1:26:36] angels that he gave in charge of us is
[1:26:39] not just because of this body is because
[1:26:42] we are carrying his life and that's the
[1:26:52] thing I want for us too to be able to
[1:26:56] draw from this amen
[1:26:59] where Brennan says is not the man that
[1:27:02] comes predestinated it's the seed is the
[1:27:09] word praise the Lord amen
[1:27:17] without the word without the promise of
[1:27:20] God for this age predestination is just
[1:27:23] a dictionary word God never
[1:27:29] predestinated flesh he predestinated his
[1:27:32] word he predestinated his promise so is
[1:27:36] that word that he's obligated to is that
[1:27:39] word that he's protected praise the Lord
[1:27:47] I was talking to her brother
[1:27:50] just yesterday yes we're just talking on
[1:27:55] some things and trying to encourage him
[1:27:57] with different things they are dealing
[1:27:59] with and I told him Isis Isis Isis bro
[1:28:02] you think about this you and myself we
[1:28:05] grew in the same neighborhood but I
[1:28:08] never knew you
[1:28:09] the thing that makes us to know one
[1:28:12] another is this word pressure law and
[1:28:18] the thing that would make us not to know
[1:28:20] one another is this word praise the Lord
[1:28:25] Amen praise the Lord
[1:28:29] is that Ida ban our hearts in Christian
[1:28:32] love we must cherish the word we can
[1:28:43] fight for our personality it's nothing
[1:28:46] what we fight for
[1:28:48] is the word what we try to defend is the
[1:28:51] word what we try to uphold is the word
[1:28:57] that's the reason why no one is above
[1:29:00] this word praise the Lord
[1:29:04] even Almighty God subject himself to his
[1:29:08] word praise the Lord
[1:29:17] the word is our absolute the word is our
[1:29:24] object of worship
[1:29:28] Amen that's the object that we are
[1:29:30] worshiping is the word we are
[1:29:34] appreciating his word we are adoring his
[1:29:37] word in our hearts and as we do there we
[1:29:40] are conforming to his word let's not
[1:29:48] play with the word
[1:29:49] let's not compromise on the word praise
[1:29:54] the Lord because that's the thing we are
[1:29:59] called to protect just like Joseph
[1:30:06] praise the Lord I believe when the angel
[1:30:09] spoke to him that night and he work off
[1:30:12] his attitude change
[1:30:15] the way he was going about thing changed
[1:30:18] completely if he had a swirled he went
[1:30:24] his shopping his walk
[1:30:27] glory be to God he could travel stay
[1:30:34] with Mary whether the parents believe it
[1:30:36] or not he was there with her because
[1:30:43] Almighty God told him this thing that is
[1:30:48] fallen in her is of the Holy Ghost we
[1:30:54] will realize that the life that each and
[1:30:56] every one of us is carrying is of the
[1:30:58] Holy Ghost
[1:31:00] when we are born again when we receive
[1:31:05] the Holy Ghost it's not a church life
[1:31:14] just man that make it not a sheep God or
[1:31:22] so much interesting to make us just like
[1:31:25] is st. Anne danger so Gabriel he sent
[1:31:29] you and myself seven angels to witness
[1:31:31] to this world we don't need to be a
[1:31:36] shame of faith we might not be able to
[1:31:42] explain everything but when this word is
[1:31:44] real to your heart you can be a shame of
[1:31:48] it
[1:31:50] praise the Lord because this is the very
[1:31:53] word that is going to change our body
[1:31:59] this word is our life and we don't need
[1:32:05] to be a shame of it
[1:32:07] praise the Lord let's protect the word
[1:32:11] in in our children let's protect the
[1:32:14] word in our life in our home let's
[1:32:19] protect the word that's what God has
[1:32:25] raising us up in this our form it's to
[1:32:29] stand for that word as a religious world
[1:32:32] go around you know and they all into the
[1:32:37] child that is born but we have seen the
[1:32:39] son amen
[1:32:42] we have seen the son and not only that
[1:32:44] we have seen it we have received a son
[1:32:49] and we're ready to stand with the son
[1:32:57] musicians you can come out tonight
[1:33:27] when he eyes so open Burberry since 1964
[1:33:30] he says now it was unusual when Joseph
[1:33:34] before the birth when he found Mary is
[1:33:40] lovely little sweetheart that he was
[1:33:44] engaged to be married
[1:33:47] he found her she was to be mother
[1:33:50] without being married so she no doubt
[1:33:57] had told him that she was visited by the
[1:34:01] angel and Joseph was a just man he was a
[1:34:05] good man he wanted to believe her he
[1:34:10] could imagine that he loved all love her
[1:34:14] with all her or his heart seeing their
[1:34:18] young Hebrew man and looking into her
[1:34:21] eyes and when she said Joseph dear the
[1:34:28] great danger Gabe revisited meaning he
[1:34:30] said I will be overshadowed by the Holy
[1:34:33] Spirit and the Holy thing that will be
[1:34:37] born in me
[1:34:38] Oh being for me mean will be called the
[1:34:44] son of God
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:48] now he wanted to believe there but there
[1:34:51] have never been anything happening like
[1:34:54] that so it was too unusual and look
[1:34:58] there was a just man a good man and the
[1:35:02] scripture claiming that it will be the
[1:35:05] Virgin who conceived and he didn't
[1:35:10] understand
[1:35:11] praise the Lord see the scripture said
[1:35:17] that Christ would be born that way still
[1:35:19] just have pudding understand it because
[1:35:23] it was too unusual now in them days
[1:35:30] there was no prophet they hadn't had a
[1:35:33] prophet for hundreds of years and so God
[1:35:37] dared with him in dream praise the Lord
[1:35:43] a dream is a secondary way the right way
[1:35:49] is always true the world first
[1:35:57] praise the Lord the right way is true
[1:36:00] the word first
[1:36:01] that's the highest way that God can
[1:36:05] speak to us it's true his word be it on
[1:36:15] to me according to your word
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:37] even though in the time of trials and in
[1:36:40] a time of unusual situation is hard for
[1:36:44] us to see that it is God but you know
[1:36:49] them when we when we confess like
[1:36:50] married they'd be it unto me that call
[1:36:52] into your word God don't get worried he
[1:36:58] never worries
[1:36:59] what are you are used to it or net
[1:37:03] praise the Lord
[1:37:05] but he looks at their heart that his
[1:37:08] constant is her running to his will
[1:37:11] they'll all be alone to me just
[1:37:14] according to your world I may not
[1:37:17] understand it
[1:37:19] praise the Lord well I just surrounded
[1:37:23] myself to your will and to your word
[1:37:26] whatever your word has promised whatever
[1:37:31] grace has placed in my path
[1:37:34] give me grace
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:44] because whatever God is allowing to
[1:37:48] happy in our life he's going to use it
[1:37:52] wherever he allows to come our way he's
[1:37:55] going to use it even though sometimes we
[1:38:01] don't like failures but just men and
[1:38:06] mates when we fail I just wash it the
[1:38:12] law now before we got into praying
[1:38:14] tonight
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:25] let's sing it together
[1:38:28] [Music]

[1:41:55] States to prepare us for this
[1:42:07] just men don't stay in the house of
[1:42:10] chain
[1:42:15] Joseph was not afraid to step out
[1:42:24] I believe there were time word he
[1:42:28] friends came to him in because he was in
[1:42:31] a state that he could not come I mean he
[1:42:34] could not understand what was happening
[1:42:35] he might have reason with him but after
[1:42:39] he had an experience of God he was not
[1:42:43] ashamed to go back to this man and tell
[1:42:45] him no you guys you are wrong just men
[1:42:56] another shame just men I'm not ashamed
[1:43:04] to confess they're wrong they are not
[1:43:08] ashamed to stand for what is right
[1:43:21] broad raise of Adam in Eden with his own
[1:43:26] needs in His image Adam was not ashamed
[1:43:34] to say unto this mountain be thou
[1:43:37] removed he never even had in his mind
[1:43:42] whether he will fail on that he never
[1:43:45] even thought of that because he knew he
[1:43:48] was raised up for them this is our day
[1:43:55] this is our our
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:04] let's think about it when we make
[1:44:06] decisions less thing about it in taste
[1:44:09] that we do and we're representing God or
[1:44:14] is it is it all about our our ego they
[1:44:17] said all about our pride he said all
[1:44:20] about our reputation and we considering
[1:44:26] that God has placed us where he placed
[1:44:29] us to be a son of God to be a daughter
[1:44:32] of God to represent him in our language
[1:44:36] in our in our manner of dressing and in
[1:44:39] the way that we do things we are to
[1:44:46] protect this world
[1:44:49] we had to protect the image of Jesus
[1:44:52] Christ
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:45:02] think about it just envision in your
[1:45:06] mind if you were joseph barbera change
[1:45:12] the decision you are making today
[1:45:14] against the world that's the decision
[1:45:16] you will have made them are you backing
[1:45:22] up from the word and you compromising on
[1:45:25] the world and you betraying the world
[1:45:29] just I was not telling Mary one thing
[1:45:31] and then telling his family another
[1:45:34] thing he was not having one appearance
[1:45:41] in church and a different appearance
[1:45:43] when he was out of church if God would
[1:46:01] take a gift from our hearts tonight and
[1:46:05] we should give him a gift tonight what
[1:46:10] gift
