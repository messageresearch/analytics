to us our father i'm not the preacher you are the preacher god prophet said heaven are you still reading you're not you are not preaching yet though is to ever not we still have a reading preparation but you are the one father you can make this a scripture fly in the heart of the people you can make them to understand this word is not about quoting bible is not quoting for the quotations it's about the life of the lord jesus christ in our heart oh god oh this evening save his father i consecrated to your hand as the your seventh brother one pray as your seventh brother jordan they pray all of the people they pray they earned expectation myself among the expectation of god oh the spirit doesn't confess your name right now father i kick them out of this congregation how to float this house in the name of the lord jesus christ for father it's not about quoting it's not about reading it's about god to come down vindicate your presence in our midst of god we seek enjoyed father coming to church going back sunday and wednesday we are the same people father we you know father today you prepare before the foundation of the world is to have a special day do is still wednesday but for you you don't see sunday wednesday you see your heart you see the heart of your children ready to receive you papa come down oh god if we can juggle through the scripture oh everything is a revelation that's what you said so pera if upon this revelation i shall beat my church oh god faith is a revelation new breath is a revelation if the word is a revelation that's why we call you father revealed to us put to me aside preach to us he lasted the prophet said where god is there is a wonder and a miracle where is god of william marion where is god of elijah where is god of daniel we want to see you father in how a church of god your children they are here for your father they want to see you they don't want to see a man we don't want to see anybody we don't want to see joseph we want to see the lord jesus in our heart oh god you calm down bless the scripture father i'm not here just quoting and reading i'm just your vessel use the gift for your people this time we need you papa in the front of the holy spirit though sick father he'll die don't they need the spirit give them the holy spirit don't let you coming protect them lord you are the solution thank you father we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ we said amen may be satan praise the lord i haven't done no way to start the way to go but god will help us right i just don't want to read there is a lot of reading and scriptures but i really want the leading of the holy spirit the dealing with the spirit is very good because that's the way god knows our problem i always like to be off not when i'm connected i'm okay i feel now i'm going yeah but when i'm not connected sometimes we just read but when he comes that anointing then he just pick up every solution everyone receive is he's myself i'm receiving my when that that anointing is not me is it him me i'm also preaching to myself that's why you have to know it's not joseph so don't be mad on me i'm just he's servant right because god will ask me that day because now is me and the god now today this wednesday i love when i'm in the bench they're gonna ask the pastor when he's preaching me i'm there just a child amen hallelujah is very responsible trying to clear atmosphere go to work because they were asking him that they were spreading i gave you that day you just play you didn't prepare you see so i don't know but now i just want you to pray for me right there in your heart i used to preach praises bridges but this day i don't want to preach i want him to preach because we we realized that we preach many years we cut stuff we preach we pray we bring anointing i don't know what can you say but sometimes you know you notice something the things they can condemn this sunday at the pulpit but the next sunday become worse that things are noticed that sometimes some yes they change some they become worse yeah so sometimes myself i ask what's going on what's going on that's why when a preacher is preaching though the preaching is not profitable to you don't be mad there is a somebody is a profitable to him because sometimes as the old-timer believers sometimes we become somehow annoyed when a preacher go a little bit down yeah but i pray god i i don't have the attitude anymore yeah if you these things we passed already we are in the seventh cells here just being of the mystery here just beginning for babies there is some these two babies they need those food absolutely amen amen we god has chosen us before the fullness of the world yes let me start from oh my goodness this is the last quote but i start now the first that's why i always this day my brother said i put the numbers i can think i can study that one but i start with the last one okay let us go to the last one almost the last okay sorry i didn't send there but i'm reading on in the book of rapture 65 december 14 paragraph 31 and i think that i speaking i just don't try to get up here to say something that i think i will please the people i never been guilty of that i want to get up here and say something as i feel led to say it that i think would be a help to you something that you further your experience with god if you are a christian just listen carefully if you are a christian and you are born a christian make you okay if you are a christian and if you are not a christian make you so ashamed of yourself that you will become a christian and that's the purpose that i've always tried to line up my thought as lord would lead you see how the prophet this is rapture 65 is is a five message after that what is the four message before we finish the preaching so sometimes the way the different preacher bring the message yeah you have to take it as a raise the things are killing the believer is a reasoning this message is not about you you're smart at school forget about your smartness you can't be smart than god god is wise intelligent everything is god knows can you imagine albert einstein a unbeliever in working is a mathematician but abraham said he enter in a laboratory of god where there is a knowledge very high knowledge are you intelligent more than habits albert you see so as we when you enter in the another world in the spirit you can enter them without mathematics of the world mathematics is the only christian you can enter where albert enter and to over because he entered they it eat the eternity but he doesn't know if he's going or not yeah he's found the speed of light i think you know the story so now you are more than our bed is time i want to tell you this message is not about coding is not about memorizing it's about life it's about life so that's why sometimes we use wrong back someone can preach life we saw him ah say baby preach us a mystery those are to preach big mysteries today some they are not giving the message when you want to found the proof of this message you will be you found proof out we receive this message by faith there is nothing you can attach this is the message of the how i can attach and explain nothing the things of god we receive by faith now good thing is and the good news is god himself must get to you must enter into you he himself must believe his own word that's why you came here we create atmosphere then god can find a way for you that's why brother branham said if the pro if the pasta if is a arrogant you'll find the church also will be arrogant if a preacher is not yet born again it doesn't ever be a burning bush he must not to preach because he will be preaching you receiving his spirit that's why the prophet said the church the way you pray to found the church that's the way you find your wife that's the same way you have to pray to fund the church don't play just any enemy just sit you going in the town any church you sit and you're gonna get a spirit and to come out you'll be in trouble clear then for the lord [Applause] so but abram said sometimes we we we preach in a such way some it could bring some out some to ponder over some to think it's a purposely when i just said uh if you don't eat my flesh don't drink my blood he never explain it why because he knows there's a some predestinated whatever they don't understand they will stick with me there's something in me i can't it's going to pull and pull away from my lord even if you take me even if you take me to hell i'm going to hell ever were gonna kick me out because the holy spirit will never go to hell clapton for the lord amen glory be to god praise god glory be to god jesus himself he went to hell he kicked the devil he took the key why didn't you stay there and if you have the same jesus in your heart right now you say i'm going to hell they're going to teach you where is your place we want to you here go away there is only hell and heaven come on now hallelujah [Applause] glory be to god i just go in anger i didn't oh it's okay that's the way god lead praise god glory be to god do you love him this evening lived in for the lord amen amen i'm reading desperation every man press into it not just simply walk in into it easily but it's got to be pressed into see now when you seek me with all your heart then i'll be found paragraph 44 and he promised that he would return and bring the people from scattered all over the edf after those 70 years back into jerusalem where they left from and it did it just that way that's right then let me just jump a little bit i want to go to the emergency that's where i want to go okay let's just go for a five because most of the time i saw people in the hospital i used being a spirit of my life it's only when i met the lord and the sickness left every year i always been in the hospital then i noticed something myself about my experience when someone demons come to take him in the hospital he screamed oh i'm going i don't want to go yes go quiet after he died some they just i saw the car horses they go this side he sent this one going to bring me orange going to bring water he didn't want to go in when they just left he left so 10 minutes before 10 minutes five d for those minutes before you go you know exactly where you are going and the babanam is saying said don't wait that last minute to start to fix your life emergency let's talk about images the nature of human being they always wait the last minute now uh you know dakar it's me i stole it forgive me you know that now it's fear emergency so baba said you ask the christian we must not wait that time we can create our emergency in loving god when you start to love more god more god you become just grace of him when it's about god you feel like he's here it's like you i'm talking to my brother danny so even when you are there you feel when more you closer we come closer to god it brings more thirsty more desire more emergency in your heart praise the lord that's why we must come to church together to receive something always you can stay home we can read the balcony pray it's different one day by the banana was at the puppet he said you know i i i wrinkled my my eyes to one lady she just entered right now she is my daughter i'm happy she came in this presence for her to receive the holy spirit it was 1965. he's talking about rebecca so brother branham couldn't give his own daughter holy spirit's home he couldn't even start to pray for her then god give give no she must come to the right atmosphere where they create atmosphere and you must have a right attitude when god is dealing for others some people they are missing a blessing some they are getting their blessing then you also you must open your heart that's why sometimes by abraham can create we want the healing for a lady of which was like 12 years old and the babylon said what can i do she was having a a a appendicitis appendix you all call it in english appending right yeah so she was going to that those years no these this is just raised they killed those days it was a serious sickness she was going to die and the abraham reached the place and they said uh are you a christian say yes do you have faith yes yes i have facebook i have faith okay and the bible saw that he didn't have a faith she have she has hope hope is enemy to faith you can stay long there you think it's the faith it's too hot right then but as a prophet he saw it he said i want to help her and he said what can i do and they start to create that's why you are god you cannot create it's because you just have a fear that's why fear i had to fear any way to pass closer to me i kick you out to fear something i always say my when i'm i'm i'm very very dangerous i want to involve an accident fear left me that's where i can master this the will still running like it's me i'm unaffected i say that after the event all the action but when i'm in that event it's like i'm a principal actor i'm acting now and when you stop they were if you were with me i do remember that they were coming to church on the snow i'm telling you my truck go left right my wife was said but she was screaming [Applause] glory to god i was going in the ditch so you see fear is something very bad when you have it over fear praise the devil and the most of people they die they injured because of fear fear something very bad i don't like fear sometimes you can feel fear for from norway you don't know where it came from you just it's come see what for fear get out of my fear glory be to god clap the end for the lord okay let me finish the story i always that store i don't finish i'm like i'm also like brother and i like stories okay now as we are the creator but the brahmanam want to create the faith in the girl now the one who is not concerned they're gonna judge wrong and they can be beaten by god so to protect them the neighbor where they were there and the parent they say you guys what i'm going to do now you you you don't i don't want you to see it right only the girl turn your your chair i don't want you you to see it all of them they turn their chair they and they remain of the girl you told me you have faith yes yes but not my faith okay can you take a division i was there and the red robe was there and they look at they say can you you know that red robe can you turn a left right with your eyes oh that is a mysticism it's always the bible says yes is in the bible remember jesus he spoke to the tree the tree dried did he touch the tree he just spoke by faith he can do that i can't do that then you don't believe it you don't have a faith so brother branham was helping her to to little to let go down her guards to recognize a a leak a spot link she doesn't have it that's where christian today they're very stubborn in the message you are trying to help they don't want to be helped they think that they've got it they're already in heaven here they just to visit they're going back when they are not yet even be served with the genuine holy spirit that's why sometimes people they can be 30 years in the message and after they quit the puppet it imposed i'm telling you it's impossible someone is distilled inside and they go away from the seal it's impossible you can't get away from the seal if god seals you you don't listen he take you off from the earth if you see someone going nonsense nothing he'll never be served because that seal you never get away but the baptism you can get away baptism can baptize you around you your soul in the spirit and you can do miracles you can stop things you can do a lot of things one day it's gonna leave you you become like you never believe you become worse than a believer you start to do things more than those that are not believing that's that's where we read that these are sometimes we ask i'll just take you somewhere can you ask yourself the disciples this is homework every day when you wake up think about that one why they disciples except judas those they were 120 they received the holy spirit did you read that the backslide no until stephen they stone him beautiful but he said forgive me forgive them what was that so what what which kind of us the holy spirit we have we have hatred we have nonsense holy spirit so what what's going on in the assemblies is not anything in the weirdo what we the news what is going on so when you hear far away don't laugh a fit don't be checking too much in your internet ask yourself there is a level where you will never know is the between the new the sanctification and the to cross with seal are very close it's matthew 24 24 you take the grace of god to say the difference because judas was justified was that sanctified the time of the holy spirit rich he show his color it's very important this holy spirit tomorrow it's very very very very important the pastors they brought us in the message the elders that we used to order on them today most of them they are outside that's why they don't like this kind of preaching they can kill you they can poison you but we are going to preach it until god is going to seal his children we are going to heaven hallelujah only things here you the truth will make you honest you'll never be popular never will be just honest i always say i said you know what most of the time we turned down god in the family marrying when my sister's there my mother we were we kicked out of the word of god the church today becomes so loose i'll be sometime with me it happened i told my wife i said oh god forgive me i'm waiting for her to come back home she come home i was praying just finishing the prayer when i just said this is packing i want to pray fast to finish and to go to open the door to kiss her you see it's good but i feel condemned one day yeah even if you are talking to by then the president and you are dealing with millions because i'm a millionaire don't worry i'm gonna give everyone i'm very rich don't worry about that hallelujah glory to god [Applause] and you are talking to biden the president and even if she knocked that they told you your wife is out there or your wife they take her to the hospital you can't stop that deal with biden you are going to feel nisha because when you miss that one finish and by then until jesus christ who is great i say my wife i'm sorry when i'm praying when i just see now you do your packing and i continue to pray i stop i'll kiss you after prayer [Music] [Applause] that's my example i gave to you because that's what it happened to everybody i just want to this one they don't need to make you laugh is to everyone we are we are going to the same so even when i'm preaching i'm preaching to myself i'm praying to myself so that's why when i'm preparing someone said god forgive me me also ah god i need the holy spirit yes i need the holy spirit now you people sometimes you can say oh eh the holy spirit all these years you never spirit it's because you don't even start to receive it someone who is close to god you will never feel sufficient it's always unsufficient unsufficient unsufficient and sufficient until you go up like a knock [Applause] if enoch will be here i'm gonna tell you i never feel sufficient until i go to heaven you will never go to attitude that's why people they they're ashamed to come in the front or pray for me three years and i ask just this boy to pray for me ah you are dying there and you are going to die for your sickness because you are so proud and the small boy you've got a gift to pray for you and you died up to you so die continue believe it or not praise the lord how did you start preaching i don't know where i have to go glory be to god so wonderful congrats you are pulling so yeah i was off note i'm coming to minot praise the lord now we are going to talk on the desperation for a few minutes now oh let me please by story castle i know he's looking at me he didn't finish the story okay let me finish all right and the babranam look at that rope he turned at the left channel right that girl said what can you do that no i thought you don't have faith but when i'm helping me hear it straight away faith create it so but the burnout tried to create atmosphere for head to every faith to change the attitude that's it his attitude it was there ready but no not though we have too much knowledge of the message knowledge of the quotation knowledge of miracle god did the last year you used to be if you today you are not forget yes we used to be if it used to now okay if you are not forget it start again when you left jesus mary and and joseph when they realized after three days a journey they didn't have the lord jesus and they sphincla said can we continue no we have to go back they went back again in three days to find the way jesus they left them if it takes to go to the calvary for you to restart again go to the calvary if you take for repentance go to repentance if you feel you are okay let me forgot continue but the problem is there is only two people they know better than yourself it's yourself and the god you know you know if you feel something you don't have you know don't wait someone to tell you i was in my office said you know you and god because my puppet is that one when it's burning she's there when it's burning hey man i mean i'm tired now okay we will keep it for tomorrow continue tomorrow because i want her to be right before i go and help others that's what i believe i didn't choose to be a preacher i never like even if to be a preacher i always run away you have chosen me then papa help my wife yeah help my wife and they help me because i don't want to tell people what i can do to tell you to do oh yes that's why it can't be it can i help you that's why i can read the i get the bible message i bring to my life i tell you what he does i tell you my wrong i tell why i fix it and we will put there god help us all over us one day the pastor was preaching he said most of the time the hospital will preach like us we are holding no no all of us we are trying all of us we are working all of us we are praying all of us we want to be changed there is also some few stuff i know myself the looseness i have to tight up to tight up to tighten up to tight up because a full surrender to god that's when one so he can come to him and heal the people and vindicate his word and if myself i'm there doesn't manifest full surrender it's not brother one it's not a sista billah or whatever my brother it's me joseph i'm wrong god to come down and there to go vindicate one does and the miracles don't put in the pasta don't put this in the dickons but to yourself come on now yes if you have a desire of a revival you must bring a revival you are the revival when i have a disaster father i am the revival from my house to work i don't even i don't mention here here we just come to warm up omar a real challenge network that's where we know a real color of you a real color of you is at work you can live like you're breathing yeah yeah i'm sick you are not sick you're fine that but human being are so slowful in their mind that it takes emergency something rises and when they do when it throws them into that desperation and really in doing that in desperation it brings out the that real thing that you are it show what you made out of in time of desperation it usually pull out all the good things that is you you see so it thinks good is in you but it takes a desperation praise the lord 46. in time of death i've heard the people one day they know they were dying that's the prophet i'm reading in desperation 63 the things that they kept the secret all their life they in desperation they were trying to confess it see and trying take this and make this right go please go do see in desperation they ought to have done that before beforehand see not wait till the time of emergency will you do so and so for me the emergency causes desperation when we ought to do it without the emergency that's why we are here when things are okay that's the time we must pray a lot when things are fine that's the time we have to pray a lot don't wait things are not okay that's why i always pray i always tell my officer when things are not okay maybe i'll find yourself i'm fine are you not normal praying just see how things goes you know that we have got only one car this one is a breakdown i said god is provide we do we do what we can do if god allows us to lose the cause hallelujah i don't care i don't care what people are going to say i care what he is going to say if that one is going to take me closer to him praise the lord they they criticize i love them hallelujah you must have a position this is the time of your colors who you are this is the time off to show who you are show who you want to help you don't wait when you're in the bed and you start to confess the voice can't even come a christian is a soldier we are the soldier i always said you know when the devil knows your position he's tired with you [Music] he tired now when you have something you always fear for you always go there oh god i don't want to touch you they ever want to touch the this morning i got saying my offer said even who lost everything we are sleeping in the car in a garage no house nothing i'll be praising the lord you look at me like a crazy person yes because the devil doesn't want to hear this because if he planning to to happen i will never move me joseph i'll be there in the garage may remember when i'm coming after the garage who i am and i would be three times four times just a trial he's a trial you will never grow up without the trial going to put to try in your life for you to grow up to learn will rio love you he puts you is with you and when you have good people they always come abroad that we love you we like just let the trial come you lost everything even if your friend the best friend came you are a sinner so okay just pray for me brother [Applause] i am jumping let me just go away face 50 i would imagine that you don't we are going to israel 49 and it was i didn't start preaching this time is flying oh okay it's fine and it was a shaking time it was a time where every man was examining himself because the word of god the prophet had no fell one time it had been proven proven to the truth whatever it said it happened just exactly the way he said it the purifier was still there and then the prophet had announced that god would only pass over when he saw the token at the door and it was a desperation speaking about israel israel people they have the pill of fire they have the prophet but at that time it was only the blood was required only the blood you believe the message many years you come to church you pay your tithe in the offering you sing we pray together but this time brother and the sister we need the token and especially this time don't follow the news don't follow the internet youtube about message information you will be discouraged if you are not sealed i i just advise you don't go there there is a mess this is the truth there is a mess some people when i'm here they told me about that one that one those they used to call them a big that will understand they are big they are big in everything yeah they're big in a sin because it's a mess they call me that i told brethren and i said i always tell you that pastor need the god and when i said that it was in 2004 they thought that i'm proud so i'm not proud i just took with the pastor five minutes i could do since pride it was vibrating pride they can vibrate i said this brother need help if there is something the devil catch you is a pride me joseph you see you know i agree with my brothers they are like my son and i can help [Applause] their friend i just i don't want to feel nothing in me this one a friend praise the lord i love you guys the friend i'm trying just to be me but when you go to the business went to the business today i act that's not me this is the real me then i act uh billions oh okay oh okay that business for 40 million we see what we can do right okay can we see about that i don't have 20 20 000 in my bankers dot 40 million we say day i act because that's a it's a business where i actually had to act to do business but when we reach god that's me i'm trying to fight because pride is all over us it's in us this body is a serpent seed nature you will never get away that's why don't run away for prayer prayer is pray brother pray sister pray to keep you away from sin pray when more you don't pray you start to love movies when you just drop a prayer you start to love soccer when you you start to love television and you said it's not problem i'm gonna put a nigerian movie for christian aha when you pray pray pray this time is a prayer time even if some music you listen some music are not too good for you to listen it's a business there is a spirit being that music sometimes i listen to kti sometimes my house is there now is that one month i haven't done to open in my in my car i just got i don't know maybe i can listen tomorrow until now one month they make me nervous when you want to move closer to god you feel then you can detect the spirit in the music is a business some people they are not even a christian they just sing sing but the things is me the way i believe those words from the bible what they sing but when my sister saw my brother sing it it's not the one who composed now the anointing come from my brother now he become a blessing to me because i nothing from god the word from the bible aim is a gift gift and the calling is without repentance the devil doesn't give a gift is the god give a gift but abraham said you have a gift but you have to choose who to give to the devil he's not a creator he doesn't that's why your gift you give to who praise the lord give to god and the anointing come and that gift will be a blessing those people they give to the devil the the hell anointing come to them they came from those music rock and roll nights club all those things when the rocker roll they sing they don't even think that go and kill that anointing from hell when they listen to those music they took the gun they shoot who told them to shoot there is the devil there is a sub nominal message trigger trigger in the music music can go straight to your soul you have to choose music there is some music you listen to the desire for prayer finish you used to pray for 30 minutes you want to pray for 15 or 10 you don't have a word to say kills your anointing the devils are subtle the devil is the preacher the devil is behind the puppet you must ask god the spirit of god to have a discernment this is the time of this limit of the bride this is the new music this then your friend this in your book you read what is your desire when you are loned when they preach against this it becomes a diver you are against the preacher what's going on what's going on the preacher just says a vessel god uses for us to be corrected oh correction holy stick thank you lord help me holy spirit god i need holy spirit i can tell the data ourselves i was 2001 10 o'clock in my room sealed until today god confirmed but when they said who he need holy spirit god i need the spirit yes i feel like i want to be more i want to customize i always have that to test i i'm not enough i just love that's why when i say amen i don't even look at you you can

mind of god chosen before the founders of the world is when you are sold then we know who you are when you are not still we don't know who you are that's the truth we don't know exactly because any
