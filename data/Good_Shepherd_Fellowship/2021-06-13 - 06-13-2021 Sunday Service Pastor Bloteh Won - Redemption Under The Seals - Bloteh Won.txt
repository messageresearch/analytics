we send the text out if you did not receive it i'm very sorry uh saturday generally is very busy for me so uh maybe that's the reason why i was hoping that somebody would pass it on to the other

have put some measures like we have always had before if you're not feeling well and uh and you still want to you know your faith is still driving you to church then use a max and and if you like to

supernatural thing you don't have to i mean i i just believe there was just a lot of faith in the building this morning amen a lot of faith in the building this morning i'll prove it to you when you

and you alone father dear lord just thank you for this privilege lord yes father thank you thank you for the call to our individual hearts yes that you have called us lord have made us lord jesus father we will just ask you now lord to come and take your word one time o god it was said there was no male worthy to take the book and to lose the seals thereof for you the almighty god the mighty angel you came down lord you took the book you loose broke the seals and father you put it in a hand of another angel that was on earth father and lord thy voice being sounding lord jesus and then in revelation 10 verse 8 lord here we are father that book one time where no man was walking it's now before us lord and we have been called to feast upon it help us lord father that we will not bring sacrifice or fools father god will be conscious of every step lord we take every move that we make lord lord there is enough for everyone we don't have to be greedy thank you [Music] because you are the god that satisfy our needs we thank you father lord with our heads bad lord honor our hearts you know the unspoken request lord you know the thing that is dear to each and every one of us this morning father why your anger move in our midst minister those things to us yes sir that we can return thanks and praises back to you because to you and you alone yes all the praise belongs we thank you father in jesus name amen amen the lord bless you matthew chapter 1. matthew chapter 1 praise the lord matthew chapter 1. i choose to read from matthew chapter one because uh uh unconsciously we've been we've been speaking on uh i think three weeks ago or two weeks ago we spoke on on rahab's scholar thread and then last week we were speaking on ruth uh god calling us to rest and uh matthew chapter one let's read together the the book of the generation of jesus christ the book of the generation of jesus christ revelation chapter 1. revelation chapter one revelation chapter 1 reads verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ let's pray together heavenly father lord there is more in those verses than the portion that we have read one time oh god you came into the temple you took the book and father word it was written by the prophet isaiah you pick up the scripture and you read a portion of the verse and you close the book and you said this day this scripture is fulfilled father your prophet many years law trying to preach the message birth pain couldn't find a scripture in a new bible and lord you said it that way because you were about to fulfill scripture lord this morning we just want to come humbly this way to you with the text that is on our heart by no means lord we want to compare ourselves to the prophet or we want to impersonate but lord god we just we want to catch the attention of your people on something and that's the reason why we just read a portion of those verses come take the rest of the services in your hands do with us as you please in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed i read those portions those two half verses because i really never knew what to read for an opening verse and the reason is because i thought that if i start reading all of my texts you know how you bribe believers are you are so easy to suck the preacher not and then you leave him struggling [Laughter] i don't want to struggle so i got to protect myself if i start giving you all my scripture you just suck it through the pages and then let me make sure there is water on here okay here they have two you know so but it's it's amazing that uh the gospel opened with uh the rev the the generation of jesus christ praise the lord and what a generation speaks about in in a generation there is history praise the lord in a generation there is history in a revelation there is mystery praise the lord so revelation is about to give us the mystery of the history we all have history and there are many parts of our history we don't understand amen there's some mystery to your history praise the lord and that's the reason why that injured him brother bran and his commission said i was sent from the presence of the lord to tell you about the mysterious thing of your life and that's the reason why that angel never left because he's here to tell you the mysterious thing about your life praise the lord it's uh yeah this i mean it's such a blessing we want to thank god for opening his word to us in the dating age that we are living praise the lord we've been playing the message daniel 70 week series gabriel instruction and the six four purpose now we own the 770 a week and then i was thinking i says you know this is a teaching normally i mean if you you should be able to we should be able to take it as a teaching and carry you through and be able to help you to understand but you see it's so easy for us to get in the information and get lost from the reality it's so easy you know people you listen to daniel seven to week you take your calculator you start calculating for the nine week three and a half years you know and you start doing all of that and then you get so caught up in the information that the reality of daniel 70 we because we know daniel's 70 week is the jews plan of redemption amen is the jews plan of redemption it's the jews gibraltar daniel that people praise the lord but why is daniel 70 week important to us we want to look at that a little bit this morning and and it will help you to understand uh the importance of the the the tape we've been playing and uh uh like i said uh the the first portion brandon break it into three potions for us gabriel instruction uh you know coming to tell daniel you know how the prince of peshawar fight fought against his prayer but the answer is here and then the second part of it is the six-four purpose and then the third part is is the 70th week now what what i want to say here is that if we go back even to the time of jeremiah or the time of isaiah right down from when uh jeroboam and and rihabram divided the kingdom to nothing and and uh southern israel we realized that the nothing kingdom went into idolatry praise the lord the northern kingdom went into idolatry the people went away from god and pretty soon the land was not getting its rest now remember that god told them to give the land its sabbath that after you have planted you have towed upon the land give the land it's rest let the land rest you know one year and then you go back and just just the same way the the sabbah was given to to the house of israel you have to work six days and then on the sabbath you rest now but because the people have gone into idolatry and and and they started the the the the forgot about obeying in all the the commandments of god and they were far away from god so you will realize that the 70th week the the captivity the reason why israel went into captivity is one of those reasons because the sabbath was forsaken the sabbath was neglected the sabbath was broken now it's it's almost like every man that made a vehicle or different things they have a manual on a vehicle to tell you drive your vehicle this amount of uh a month and then go for an oil change they put all of that there that's that is the same way the almighty god that made us he gave rules for this body amen amen he gave rules for this body and and some of the things that he told us is that we must give fine time to give the body rest praise the lord amen and like i said last week rest is very important is very very very important rest is one of the things that uh uh you know it reveals what was in god's mind because right in creation he did not despise that after he got a man in his image he rested it's very important praise the lord because it's a spiritual lord as much as it's a physical lord physically if you don't give your body rest you will send your body to captivity and you might be in the hospital with drapes hanging over you praise the lord amen do i need to hear what i've just said sister naomi says yeah praise the lord first call your wife is chasing me now amen praise the lord now so uh uh but that that is a principal thing that we must keep in our mind it's a principle thing even spiritually every time we come into his presence whether at home whether in church you are finding rest because our strength comes from the lord that's why paul said neglecting that the assembling of the saints so the neglect of rest took the people into captivity let me say it that way i just wanted to get that in there and i saw we see here that uh uh uh the the seventh week like i said is the jewish plan of redemption but the reason why the 70 week is important to us is because in the middle of the last week the middle of the last week there was three and a half years that was jesus ministry and the the other three and a half years before he come to the jews right in the middle is the gentile dispensation amen so there is a parenthesis there is a parenthesis but scott if you look in your scuffy bible and you go to genesis chapter 38 you will see that scoffy had an insight you know broadband talks about him he was a great scholar he had an insight but he never had a revelation the revelation only comes to a prophet in the scofi bible it has right over genesis 38 parenthesis and for many years that that hang over my head as i've i was and i've gone through my scuffy bible to look for different places where he have parentheses but this parenthesis too out to me because if you go back to the chapter before it begins the story of joseph it begin the story of joseph and the sword of joseph is important to the redemption of israel because that's how they will go into a strange land and then god will come and bring them out with a mighty hand that's right are we together amen so the story of joseph starts in chapter 37 with joseph dream and and and his brother hid his dream and all of that and right at the end of just of of chapter 37 joseph goes to his cross and instead of the story continuing chapter 10 it comes with a different story about a gentile woman in temer and in chapter 10 nothing is said about joseph chapter 39 the scripture pick up joseph's story again [Laughter] amen that's daniel 70 weeks that's daniel 70 weeks that is the important of daniel's 70 week told the gentile church because it brings out that parenthesis it brings out the gentile dispensation that is between the three and a half years of jesus ministry and the three and a half years to the jews so when people get into dino seventh a week and take their calculator and starts to calculate and starts to add up you know and say well jesus will come this day and jesus will come this he said no may knows amen amen praise the lord amen the importance the importance is to be able to show that's the reason why the prophet of god said if we want to know what time it is spiritually we must look at israel amen because it's right in israel time that god brings an olive branch and grafted it into the vine that's why paul said in romans we are a grafter vine that's down here 70 weeks that is the importance of daniel's 70 week to the gentile church praise the lord so you see like i said the the the mystery of the history amen and i got tired of what i'm speaking on this morning redemption under the seals and i would tell you that redemption under the seals it's a dangerous business amen it's a dangerous business i was i was looking at that last night and brother branham said yet in the first seal let me read that to you i just took a line there that i taught how am i taught in it and i will tell you why why i say it's a dangerous business praise the lord that in the first seal he says now that's the first seal just after he read the scripture the one we are going to try by the grace of god to explain tonight by the very best and i realized that a man trying to explain that is walking on dangerous ground if you don't know what you are talking about praise the lord and is is is dangerous business because you cannot impersonate redemption praise the lord you cannot impersonate redemption you cannot work out your redemption praise the lord amen yes it's a dangerous business i'm telling you you know like brother brown says right yeah the man must know what he's doing what he's walking because he's on dangerous ground can you can you imagine that the prophet moses the man that opened the red seat the man that even hired god to change his decision when god wanted to wipe the people out he's still in the gap but when he came to a time where he displeased the lord god told him you will now see the promised land praise the lord amen so you see how uh in as much as it's a privilege to be walking before the king we have to know what we how we are walking and what we're talking about because we are on dangerous ground the same ground that was a holy ground can become a dangerous ground that's why we don't take these things lightly we don't take serving god lightly because it's not your choice are we together praise the lord amen so we we we want to look at this and and the reason why because i'm bringing this uh daniel 70 week thing in and to be able to help you so when we come to the end of the tape you'll be able to appreciate or if you miss some things in it you go back again and see and broadband have some very wonderful information history type church and all of that but there was a reason the major not india the golden nugget in there is the space of time for the gentile dispensation that's the major thing that concerns us and as i was as i was studying last night i thought about it why gibral have to give daniel six purpose why not seven purpose let's turn it down to chapter 20 chapter nine why not seven prefers just follow me slowly here when i start preaching i go fast and then i miss things up because you are pulling me here and there so before you start let me just get set to you praise the lord now daniel i mean gabriel speaks to daniel here in uh uh chapter 9 verse 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people the jews brother ben and in daniel 70 we he emphasizes he says that's daniel people the jews 70 week is determined upon that people and upon the holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin to to make reconciliation for iniquity three to bring in everlasting righteousness for to seal up the vision praise the lord five division in prophecy and to anoint the most holy sex so these were the six purples uh uh of of that of gabriel uh a visit to daniel but why not seven purpose why you have to be six if you remember last week boss gave ruth six ballot love also why you have to be sick praise the lord amen and it was after six days i mean uh uh that that that god rested the message of souls in praising he says washed out seven it's always a mystery amen it's always a mystery so there was there was a mysterious seven purpose there was a mysterious seven purpose that was going to bring a people that were not called the people of god a mysterious seven purpose here we go we're going to bring us from our idolatry and other worships we that were met in the incarnate of god we were not in god's economy but we were at the back part of his mind so you see there was a mysterious seven purpose just like when boris gave ruth six ballet love why because he was the seventh [Applause] amen moses gave the children of israel sick city of refuge and when jesus came he said come unto me oh he delivered because he is the seventh city so the seven is always a mystery praise the lord but for you to appreciate the seven you have to appreciate the history [Music] because there's a mystery to every history [Laughter] oh praise the lord amen can we do some preaching this morning glory be to god hallelujah amen jesus at the at the wealth with the samaritan woman she has been with six husband amen jesus said you've been with five the one you are away six it's not your husband praise the lord there was a seven [Music] but he was a mystery amen they first started fussing and arguing the one that was going to be the love of her life she started struggling with him the very one that was going to be the love come and see the man she did not introduce the sixth man but this seven man she said come and see the man that have told me [Applause] everything praise the lord my my my my my glory be to god that seven is a mystery there seven is a mystery praise the lord amen woof i said it i mean you're you're already pulling me out of all of my notes now [Laughter] glory be to god we just have to love the lord i'm not a lecturer i'm just here to stimulate you so you can just fall in love with him that's all i'm here to do i'm not a preacher i'm just here to stimulate you put you right through the scriptures and see what the prophet of god said amen praise the lord now let's look at this thing because if you watch the life of ruth like we spoke two weeks ago it was strange it was last night i was studying and it just struck my mind and i said wow we there with ruth rahab ruth and now terema brings us to daniel's seventh week and all of these three women are mentioned in matthew chapter one in the history of jesus christ but you see we were not appreciated until we realized and understand there was a mystery for why they were put in the genealogy of jesus christ yes sir praise the lord moreover gentile women and just like we said rehab for her to be able to launch those spies that was a danger of business that's right redemption honor the seals is always a danger of business praise the lord i mean it's a danger of business for you to be believing the message that is that is scandalized on the on the on the internet come on pray praise the lord for you to be believing the man of kentucky that you never saw that's a danger of business for you to tie the rest of your effort joining to this reputation it's a danger of business oh that's the reason why he that put his hand to the plot and take it back it's never counter wealthy it was a dangerous business for her to hide those spies praise the lord amen and just like we said reading the scripture rehab told them get down to the mountains high yourself three days that shows the three days that jesus spent in the earth hire yourself three days job said for thou will hire me glory be to god it was a danger of business for her to be able to get a red card and put it down her window when military guys are all in the dirt searching all around trying to find these spies if they who have seen that car coming down that window they would know that someone came down that place praise the lord and so then you're a business are we together but we we saw in the scripture that ray have the very same call that she led the spires down by was the very same call that joshua told her or the leader of the spy told her to hang to her window for a talking our life for yours amen and this will be a true talking praise the lord amen now you have you have to read between the lines here because if she told him to hide themselves for three days they were not going anywhere so for three days she did not put the token up because the search was going to be for three days [Music] and after three days she pulled her car up praise the lord how could she put her entire family life on that when they told her that this whole city is coming down in rome how could she believe those men that only that part of the wall where her house was to stand how could she believe that danger of business you remember ruth last week going into the feast of the harvest after the threshing floor when the weeds are being trashed after the trashing floor there are feasts of the night where feasts were owned at the men praise the lord amen the dance around the lord of the harvest the the drink and again themselves only man but yet now mina's telling her danger of business that's redemption honor the seals glory be to god praise the lord danger of business see ruth sneaking over the hills and then and she have just put on her pretty dress now let me tell you her wash yourself anoint yourself change your raymen she got her pretty dress but she has to be kneeling down glory be to god amen no matter how much your clothes cost you can never put it to the price of the love for your love [Applause] praise the lord if you say have problem to reference your clothes more than loving god that you can fall on your knees and lay on the floor then you need revelation in your heart you need the grace of god to give you a breath [Applause] because you can you cannot put a price to the love that he had for you praise the lord but it was a dangerous business glory be to god as she goes in the evening time and the men are yelling sometime when the year she thought they have seen her she got a duck ahead praise the lord danger of business if you have an idea of how many devils from hell that have been assigned to your life to distract you and disrupt you from going on with god don't go there brother praise the lord it's dangerous business to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus is dangerous business oh yeah this is not church membership amen notice now church membership this is the father's business you remember jesus said i must be about the father's business there is one terminology that i always go with business they say it's risky it's it's it's a rex you are thinking praise the lord you borrow all of those money from the bank i mean you know it's not like you're making people to come and buy from you praise the lord amen if you don't know how to do business you start doing charity [Music] praise the lord because after you have it for a couple of months nobody can buy you stop being nice to the neighbors all glory be to god amen amen my goodness that's the same thing with the father business people it's risky praise the lord can you think about it the man that walk the streets of galilee healing the sick yes amen making the lame to walk pretty soon his firm went all over the place there is no man i ever spoke like that man hear the precious words from his mouth the bible says why he teach in the book of might the people were healed praise the lord thank you jesus amen but in no time the clock flipped that's right the very same people that said hosanna that's right they say crucify him that's dangerous business with all the politics around church all the scandals that is around church all the scandals all people think in their mind about any church is just money now other thing in your mind praise the lord and you want to tie your repetition to that praise the lord that you would just see a man only because of the love of god that you love god and god has given you grace to believe that he sent a prophet he sent a message for this age and then you see a man and trust him as your pastor that's risque that's a risk of business i'm just trying to be earnest with you [Laughter] oh thank you jesus thank you jesus amen but you say there is an inner anchor praise the lord there is an inner anchor amen that's the reason why we don't fall in love with the pastor we don't fall in love with the church we fall in love with jesus because if the man fail we keep going on praise the lord if the man still it does not affect my law because i just appreciated him but i love the [Music] lord redemption all of these gentile women for them to be redeemed and please honor the blessing of abraham it was a risky business for them in the middle of the night when everything is silent all of those guys are drunk and snoring ruth find herself now i ever said that i mean they are all men how can she tell who is boss how can she tell who is boss and those guys are drunk and she said more about girl i mean he one of them could ravage her and says well i was wrong i didn't know you're not supposed to be here why why you came to do here praise the lord it was a risky business and she's creeping no that's number words praise the lord she's looking okay he should be there because i see man you know all around but this is this one right up there so he should be the one which is creepy praise the lord the bible says when she pick up the blanket boars and lie on her feet he started praise the lord he got fighting who's that and she said it's your handmaid ruth he said let no men know that they are have come into my teeth the scripture says right before the break of day he took sex violent love and give to her he said go on to your mother-in-law praise the lord read the rest of the scripture what now may say when ruth came to her let's go in the book of ruth a little bit there and read i love that i love that praise the lord are we together amen oh my glory be to god hallelujah amen praise the lord verse 18 of chapter three naomi said then she said that's naomi speaking says still my daughter until the martyr until they know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest you have already stared on something for the man will not be in rest you have provoked the holy ghost for the man will now be in rest until he have finished the fake this day praise the lord until come on my goodness boys when he woke up in the morning he never even looked at the harvest harvest was not on his mind all that was on his mind i have an unfinished business i gotta get to work he went directly to the man that was nearest in kings and he met him there is a now man down there from your king line you are the man in my way you have to redeem her today [Music] praise the lord i mean that's what happened after you have gone through all the criticism people said things about you they gossip about you they told all sorts of things you know that they misinterpret your life and what all of that all because you are you are taking a risk of business to believe in the message that is criticized around the world you are tying your life to and you say i believe malachi 4 i believe there will be a bride i believe there will be a resurrection you have got yourself in a rescue business [Applause] when you do that you provoke heaven you provoke heaven yes oh my goodness that was what shadrach meshach and abednego they said o king all kings oh king [Applause] even if our god do not deliver us that word to deny the deliverer from delivery even if our god do not deliver us we will not buy down [Applause] see what brother branham said brother branham said the cross so much trouble in heaven that god has to send for the angels [Music] one worm that that one over the floor he said god i remember what i did in the dead of noah i can pour water down there and whip out the horde of babylon almighty god say you stand back buddy this is not your job this is my job oh praise the lord because so much trouble in heaven so much trouble [Applause] the man will not rest hey until he finished this glory day to god praise the lord when you take rex for god amen not giving your body to be burned no taking god at his word the man will not rest until he have finished praise the lord naomi did not have to go running around and me like relative and say come and redeem me ruth have already done the work boy i've got to work alimony he said y'all buddy what's up no time for bullying it's time for business let's step in the chamber what are you saying about now me praise the lord there's nothing there that interests me you know because i mean she having their own mobility girl with her and you know she left from here okay okay the law required that you got to get in the public place and kick off your shoes praise the lord you can say everything you can criticize but you got to get before the end of this day before the sun goes down [Laughter] oh my goodness it's a risky business praise the lord praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we serve amen we come to tema amen she she was the first woman that was mentioned there in matthew chapter one praise the lord and what about this woman just like i said just show up in genesis chapter 38 when the story is all about joseph it's all about joseph but tim i just show up a canaanite woman that one of the sons of judah got marital praise the lord hallelujah and that woman she went through the four anointing because she got married to the first son amen the second one all now he misbehaved himself and got there with him the tail one was young praise the lord she went through the four anointing all you can say the four house rather praise the lord but we know what the story is brother branham tells us a little bit about it here praise the lord amen question and answer he talks here then says the scala trade if you notice it was judah and he had sons and his son married a canaanite woman in the and this and this canada woman didn't have any children and his son died and the lord then was to take the next son how to take his brother's wife and raise up a seed to the dead and then and all the men did not cooperate that was all there and and do as he he should do and the law slid him then he had one young son so judah said wait till this sun grows up until the place where you can marry him but you see that uh she she was a young woman and it was something that was that was very common of the sons of hebrew if he was if he was taught in in in the house of his father if he grew up and and at 12 years old 13 years old that's where they were they were taught the commandments there was something that was that was that was uh always about them you know even if they would go away then they're married you know not marrying jewish girls but they will always make sure they make emphasis on the law of moses you can see why ruth was attracted to go with her mother-in-law that she would even confess your god will be my god because she was so much taught the lord of israel until she wanted to see the god that go open the recipe praise the lord amen so tear my year was told to wait on the younger son praise the lord wait until he get older and being a young woman i call him to the lord she could not step out of that family to marry praise the lord it's it's a it's a strange thing but uh uh i mean not many people looking to and many people appreciate it but because at that time they were on a law uh that that uh uh promoted a polygamy style of life the man could have us as as many wives that he wanted the woman had to be lawyer to her husband so what happened actually was that in those kind of a times you find word women were abused if a man friend or his wife he had other wives he would just leave that woman and stay with the rest of these and a young woman who could never enjoy her youth she could have never been happy in her house it became a concern now many times people think that the bill of divorcement was something that the man was proud of no moses actually under the law introduced that as a protection for the woman it was a protection for the woman and even till today i was following the documentary it stayed on in in modern israel families have to go to law they have to hire advocates our lawyers to to be able to fight on their daughter's behalf because if a woman would step out of her her marriage home to befriend another man the family could stone her to death so now the elders of israel went to moses and that was when fathers complained for their daughters how they were treated and the lord told moses that they should be issued a bill of divorcement so the woman kept that whenever the man family want to threaten her she shows them this excuse me can you read this praise the lord and after he reads it he knows that he cannot leave his hand on that woman glory be to god so in this situation tama had to stay in her parents house but she knew she knew that she was never counted in the blessings of abraham until she had brought forth a seed of abraham praise the lord not only having a name as a church member but you need to have a seed of abraham you need to bring forth the seed of abraham praise the lord glory be to god so she said i have to do this it's a risky business but i have to do it it's a dangerous business i could be stoned as unharlot praise the lord and the scripture says she disguised herself like a holler only looking for one man only looking for one man and that man was judah you see what she wanted was she wanted the original seed because the songs came from the father so she wanted the original seed send this one that's not meant so i can get the original seed and it's done praise the lord she played her harlot judah said i would give you money she says i don't want money sir he says what should i give you give me a little goat a kid i'm not on the farm well you can give me something i'll wait for you yeah your staff you're braceless something that was that was peculiar to him something that he will not deny god can never deny the holy ghost because it's his spirit yes hallelujah yes something that he would not deny judah could deny money he said no i didn't give you money even a kid of god he would say no this that all of these go there meaning but when it comes to his staff in his bracelets praise the lord they're stopped was the structure that would be in judah so she knew the significance of it she says just leave here i wait for you you should say okay okay guys she'll go again bring her goat i'll be right down here give it to her take my thing and bring it she was gone she was gone praise the lord now judah was restless because he could be blackmaid she could go to the news media of that day and say look i have something for you to report on you report this story but that was not her intention because she knew she came in the season of life she knew that this was the season of life praise the lord if i miss this i will be dead if she missed it they would stone her to death because what she disguised us as she was doing prostitution that's right so they was tuned her to death it was a dangerous business praise the lord amen you realize that when god comes down and and and sometimes he pulls the people then god is dealing with the heart of an individual and god is just bringing that person to a birth bringing them to a birth trying to break in your life and take them to another level of walk but what the brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god reveal sometimes we we allow our work we allow our our you know a noise around the home we allow you know friends we allow things to to just take us from out of the atmosphere if you miss it if you miss it that's why paul said concerning the rest today is the date of salvation tomorrow is not promised onto any man when god is dealing with your heart yeah now all you can do just yell just surround her just say beard unto me lord be it unto me while we can trust him that god is more than able he more than evil we think we can make excuses that god will be merciful on amen it was dangerous business because if she missed the season of life she don't have another chance to ever have the blessing of abraham that was a type of the holy ghost she would be stoned to death my goodness she was nervous on her end judas was also nervous [Laughter] he was nervous when his seven came back and says the letter is not dead oh my god oh my god oh my god now i'm going to be black made in this town because everybody respected him he was a prince praise the lord and tamar is also nervous on her end whatever she had at that time to see if she was pregnant she was doing it whatever she had whatever test and she couldn't tell anybody because she did not wanted a secret to go out but you see the thing about it that uh uh people young people she was not driven by lust no she was not driven by lust she just didn't wanted to go out there and have fun and mess herself up she was driven by a promise there was something she wanted to achieve she wanted the blessing of abraham it's just like rebecca disguising jacob so he would gather a blessing isaac would even tell by his voice say your arm it feels like isa but the voice is jacob i knew i know his legs was trembling under him he was just saying eat this fool quickly and bless me before ezra gets here he kept looking over his shoulder he says is it nice daddy is it nice yeah it's nice it tastes just like isa but that voice of yours he kept looking over his shoulder that was dangerous business it's always a dangerous business praise the lord and pretty soon word came to jacob that his daughter-in-law was pregnant never taught about it never thought about it so josh manta bring her here by which man are you with this child my goodness can you think about it all the things that were going through tear my mind what what what what she could give in as a defense what if i did not hide his staff that is unique to him and she just pulled those things from honor horror by the man the healthiest is by the man now i'm with china praise the lord and after a while she has shown up and and she was a mother and then and when she showed up that she she was to be a mother they came and told judah that daughter-in-law has played the part of valhalla said because uh that she used to be a mother and your both boys are dead he said well she will be called forth and burned and so and so she went she sent word to judah and said the man that did this on the staff and the sickness all right that was her father-in-law and he said she's more righteous than i praise the lord she's more righteous than i what was healing on the day the righteousness that we come to a gentile church will not come from our obedience to the law it's a righteousness that will be imputed the righteousness that will come to a gentile church will not come but the obeying of the lord all the commandments it's a righteousness his righteousness that has been imputed to us he became sin for us that we might become his very righteousness praise the lord that's the reason why we live a life of appreciation not alive of do and done it's a life of appreciation we are so grateful that he have put us in his righteousness he has dressed us with his righteousness how can we be ungrateful how can we any longer live in sin when grace has come and dressed us we that were one slave driven by habits he has come and dressed us in his righteousness by prophecy he said she's more righteous because what she wanted was the blessing she was not burning with passion she just didn't want her to hang around with boys she wanted the blessing whatever it takes to get the blessing that's what she was going to do praise the lord so instead of getting a child from the sun she got the original seed from the father amen praise the lord but it was a dangerous business yes glory be to god amen you see brother branham there every evening of those seals he had to sit and wait for the injured of the lord praise the lord amen he had to sit and wait for the angel of the lord something he said yet in the first seal i i took that out of my notes there and and to see all of this men brother brandon reading lakons and reading ellen g white and you're reading all of these uh people's coffees and all of these uh uh a great man and and outer pink and all of that it was it was surprising to me that i i saw brother brandon referring to autoping one time and i said oh my goodness my goodness i love some of his reading when i when i studied them he says here brother branham says here he says i read that to you he says i realize that a man trying to explain that is walking on dangerous grind if you don't know what you are doing praise the lord then he go ahead he says but i'm just as positive as i'm standing here tonight that a come afresh to me today from almighty god every night he had to wait now the angel was not bringing something that was not there praise the lord with all of these people fussing about brother branham pleasure rise lincoln the angel was not breaking the the purpose of this messenger was to tie the loose ends the ants were already there but they were loose so he could pull from here he could pull from here and make the picture clearer praise the lord it was a dangerous business to not be educated praise the lord no theological background and to say it every evening and wait for an angel to come and bring you a word not anything new but to put the picture right to put the puzzle together and make the picture clearer redemption under the seals has always been the danger of business let's read this brother branham said from gift i'll read this and we close here he says and tonight we can hear of god's gift and won't walk across the street no wonder she will rise up and condemn this generation that's the queen of the south but she wanted to know she was brought more than life to her a worth more than life to her now whenever she took riches and gifts to give it if it was so now this little woman set out with all these riches spies and talents of goals and everything to to give to the curse of god if it was so she didn't know it was so the gift of solomon she owned a year but she took gifts she just heard so fed count by earring so she goes to to the meeting to find out look what she had to raise in them days them deserts were full of ishma knights and and robbers why they would tear that little guy down and take all the god she was traveling she was traveling hundreds of miles to get down there praise the lord that's when revelation has taken the hold of a man's heart nothing was satisfied there is no distance that is too far to go to get in the presence of god nothing will satisfy nothing was satisfied sometimes you might even have to have the privilege to go right into a live service but it's not the same then when you are in the mess praise the lord i mean you have to pull because because you you are now receiving from the fourth dimension amen amen you are receiving from the fourth dimension so there are a lot of wars going through there evil spirits are attracted to the fourth dimension praise the lord i mean they are attracted that's the reason why i mean you're reading your bible on your phone before you realize a whatsapp message come and somebody post something on facebook why because evil spirit is not that the people that are sending the message our evil spirit don't misunderstand me praise the lord but because it's coming through the medium of the fourth dimension amen so it has a way of distracting you and then you stroll down again janet janet uh this thing i've read it before jenna stop standing this then you go back again you have already lost your concentration praise the lord you have lost your concentration praise the lord and then before you realize your software is now becoming so nice you feel like laying back you just draw the table you lay back and you crank your feet press on brother preach hallelujah praise the lord because you don't have no deacons oh my god you don't have no deacons so you you're in the comfort of your own place maybe you can get yourself some drink a pop praise the lord cooking will be too much i can throw some bread put the toast on but you see the thing about it there is there there are people that discipline himself also amen that disciplined himself lord be to god his sister was telling me she get up in the morning she dress she takes back she dress as she's coming to church she wear her best wear her shoes everything it takes discipline because you know you are coming against a wall you have to understand it it's not it's this is not if you take it in the sense of criticizing then you miss the whole mark what i'm trying to tell you there is that the fourth dimension is a wall it's it's it's uh it's it's a realm where devils are attracted to but says the television will be will have been a blessing he said it would have been the blessing but satan got a hold of hey just like our cell phones are blessing we can talk to people around the world but you know how many men are inspired by the devil they don't sleep they only come out with evil apps but you see we have to take race we have to discipline ourselves sometimes we have to be strong on ourselves but when i'm talking about the queen of shepherd here she had to take race amen as she pressed her way through because she wanted to partake of the gift that she have heard about praise the lord we go through the same thing every one of us in some way we take rich by taking god at his word it's risking praise the lord i mean it's risky the lord have not given you a vision we have not given you a dream the only thing you have is the word and your faith praise the lord there is nothing there is nothing in your ethnic body that tells you that you are going to heaven beside your faith right nothing tells you if you listen to your mind you will not be here this morning because the devil floods your mind with discouragement and evil talks praise the lord sometimes you listen to the symptom of your body you ask yourself where is god the only thing that you have that tells you there is a heaven or there is a god it's your faith it's your faith if you want to prove me different okay i'm i'm willing to be corrected that's the only thing we have that's what you say contain for the faith content for the faith you have to cherish it you have to fight you say lord i believe you i believe you praise the lord the lord bless you musicians you can come we have some brothers and sisters and i believe it's not only this assembly that do have they go to work and they get off work seven teddy but yet they want to be in church they have worked all through the night not enough sleep but if they find time to get down on the highway that's risky business that's risk business but that's what redemption honor the seals does [Music] it pulls you amen sometimes you don't even understand it lord jesus but there's just a law thing in your heart and you find people that have gone through church breaks up in different things disappointed by ministries you feel so broken but there is just something in you that is pulling you to the next level something pulling you to pass by all of those things that have happened it's a risky business praise the lord i think about that many of the time you know you i mean you you you're tired and i mean you are there and and uh yeah i mean you gotta talk to people all through the day praying and sometimes you just so stress up [Music] so easily to be misunderstood that's the life of a preacher so easily to be misunderstood and sometimes people say things it just crush your spirit it's a dangerous business [Music] praise the lord [Music] the lord can help and all preachers some wording and he can labor and pray and fast and stay in that one place for many years crying to god for the revival and as the lord starts helping a young man can just get up like a reh abram scatter the people away or come and preach some kind of offensive gospel [Music] and they no longer want that old preacher again it's a risky praise the lord my tribe guiding me constantly he's giving me victory let just worship him now this is a reality something keep holding me oh something keep holding me every day i see [Music] helping me faithfully to overcome my tribe he's guiding me constantly giving me victory he's a reality something keep holding me jesus keep holding me oh jesus keep holding me [Music] every day i see [Music] helping me faithfully hallelujah jesus thank you father thank you lord thank you

confused history and the thing about for you there is a mystery there's a place there where god was healing there's a place there where he was using that situation to write his love upon your heart because there is no way that you will understand it until he had to put you in that situation he had to bring you through those places oh hallelujah heavenly father lord we just come this afternoon

sister sister patient and this uh sunday afternoon we're going to bring little grace to baptism she's been you know asking requesting that we do this for the wine and so we just read this portion of paul letter to the romans in romans chapter 6. what shall we say then shall we continue in the scene that grace may abandon god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live in a longer day knowing that that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death wherefore we are baptized with him by baptism into death that life as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life amen praise the lord we know how this is very important to each and every one of us i think many of you can remember the time you you took your decision just like pause i mean peter said in the book of peter this shows a good conscience towards god and i will tell you that many of our young people by the grace of god they have a good conscience towards god more than the word out there and we are only coming based on god's word it's recorded in the bible that that belief and is baptized shall be saved and god also promised that he will fill them with the holy ghost amen like i have said in this local assembly we have a scripture in the bible where god gave the holy ghost to a child in his mother's womb praise the lord so there is no age limit here right from the womb to the grave the holy ghost can be given praise the lord in the book of kings the quickening power was able to quicken the man that was dead whose body was thrown on elijah's body so uh that's what we're going to do little grace this chart is uh it's a miracle chime [Music] and let's turn this way that's uh that is not my best position [Music]
