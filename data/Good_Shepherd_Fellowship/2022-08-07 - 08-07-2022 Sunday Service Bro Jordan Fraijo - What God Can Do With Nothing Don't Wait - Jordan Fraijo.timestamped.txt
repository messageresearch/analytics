[39:01] whole you know that we sing that course
[39:03] over and over again it's asking are you
[39:04] washed
[39:06] in the blood of the lamb
[39:07] it's not you're not stating something
[39:09] but you're asking everyone around you
[39:11] and yourself a question have i been
[39:13] washed in the blood of the lamb have i
[39:15] been plunged beneath that flow where
[39:17] i've been made white as snow
[39:20] and you if you're paying attention to
[39:21] all those verses we get up to that last
[39:23] verse put that last verse for me real
[39:24] quick so i can read it
[39:28] if you have not been washed if you ask
[39:30] yourself the question
[39:31] this this song is a sermon in itself
[39:34] because it comes all the way to the end
[39:36] it takes you right to the cross
[39:38] it just let you know all you do is lay
[39:39] aside your garments that are stained
[39:41] with sin you don't have to keep them
[39:44] if you've asked yourself the question of
[39:45] course am i washed
[39:47] do i need that washing this morning
[39:50] you it says lay aside your garments and
[39:52] you can be washed because there's a
[39:55] fountain flowing for the so unclean
[39:58] and just be washed by the blood of the
[40:00] lamb that's all you need
[40:03] you see
[40:05] oh i love these songs these inspired
[40:07] songs so much
[40:09] every time
[40:11] saints
[40:13] when we
[40:15] get out of the rhythm of our religion
[40:19] and actually get into the inspiration
[40:23] of the word
[40:24] of the word that these songs were
[40:26] written in
[40:27] these are men inspired of god
[40:30] all these songs whether they're fast
[40:32] songs slow songs um
[40:34] their praise songs worship songs songs
[40:37] that that help you to
[40:39] take and reflect upon yourself this
[40:41] song's acting you reflect
[40:42] are you washed
[40:44] are you washed it's just not a nice song
[40:47] with a nice rhythm with the nice lyrics
[40:49] but it has a message
[40:52] something god laid upon someone's heart
[40:55] inspired to them said
[40:57] write this message in a song
[41:00] that many of people will sing it
[41:03] that many of people maybe they'll hear
[41:05] the tune and they'll go home
[41:07] and maybe even in that service it didn't
[41:09] strike them but later they'll go home
[41:11] and that tune will stay with them and
[41:13] somewhere a long way they'll be humming
[41:14] that song and all of a sudden it'll
[41:15] strike their heart
[41:18] am i washed because so i can lay aside
[41:21] my dirty garments right now
[41:23] i don't need to be in a church building
[41:25] i don't need to be with someone else i
[41:27] can lay them down right now and be warm
[41:30] in the blood of the lamb

[41:46] send every all of you greetings there
[41:48] from zimbabwe i think i got a quick
[41:51] video and a picture he sent me i sent it
[41:53] to the back i don't know if we have that
[41:56] go ahead and just
[41:58] share it with you so we can all be a
[41:59] part of that
[42:02] you know i think that's important is
[42:04] brother random made that statement and i
[42:06] think we're going to follow up on that a
[42:07] little bit in the sermon he said if if
[42:09] you can't go
[42:11] he said send somebody
[42:13] you know we always think in this case
[42:15] brother brother one is on the other side
[42:17] of the world
[42:18] go ahead and play
[42:32] [Music]
[42:37] is
[42:40] [Music]
[42:45] yes
[42:51] [Music]
[43:06] i think the other one's just a picture
[43:07] of the same
[43:12] but
[43:13] but yeah you know he said if you can't
[43:15] go yourself he said send somebody
[43:18] or support he said support somebody
[43:22] and if that's some way you can do it
[43:23] financially or as the church we do that
[43:27] but even in your prayers
[43:29] in your prayers support them brother
[43:31] branham said the the reason the main
[43:33] success for his ministry
[43:36] said was those little prayer warriors
[43:38] back at home
[43:39] on their knees praying him through
[43:44] think about that
[43:46] we each and every one of us have a
[43:48] place and a part to play
[43:52] no matter how small or little you think
[43:54] you are or how little you have to
[43:56] contribute no matter how young no matter
[43:59] how old no matter how big or how small
[44:03] we have a part to contribute
[44:05] that will have an eternal effect
[44:09] on the lives of somebody
[44:11] brother branham said if those little
[44:13] prayer warriors or those who are able to
[44:16] give what they can give out of their
[44:18] talents their ability their finances
[44:20] whatever it is that you have that you
[44:22] can contribute to that
[44:24] he said for every soul that is saved
[44:27] from that ministry
[44:28] your name is attached to it eternally
[44:32] from here to the end of time
[44:34] you didn't have to be there you didn't
[44:36] have to be the one to preach the message
[44:38] you didn't have to be the one to
[44:41] uh lay hands on the sick
[44:44] you didn't have to be the one to stand
[44:45] in that icy cold river and baptize all
[44:48] those giving their lives to christ
[44:51] and yet your name is attached because
[44:53] you were a part of it
[44:55] because we're all part of a body
[44:57] and if you're supporting the body
[45:00] if you're a part of the lungs that helps
[45:02] bring in oxygen to the body that helps
[45:04] the legs move
[45:05] it doesn't matter that you're not the
[45:06] legs moving across the ground
[45:09] if you're a part of the
[45:10] the
[45:11] the heart that helps the body move what
[45:15] it needs around or whatever part you
[45:17] play and how big or small
[45:20] you're a part of that body
[45:22] and every success
[45:25] that is attributed to that body is
[45:28] attributed to you
[45:29] so we can all equally rejoice
[45:32] you know paul said that he said he said
[45:35] we we can if any part of the body does
[45:38] well
[45:39] we can rejoice with them
[45:41] and when you realize that you can
[45:43] connect you can see a little video like
[45:45] this from halfway across the country
[45:46] many of us may never meet a single
[45:48] person
[45:50] standing in that group
[45:52] but we have a connection
[45:54] that's stronger than any bond you'll
[45:56] ever meet on earth
[46:00] and that that's kind of what we're going
[46:01] to talk on this evening or this morning
[46:04] we got a couple of prayer requests it's
[46:06] just been a beautiful morning already we
[46:09] had a couple of testimonies of the
[46:11] greatness of our god
[46:13] uh how his his ability in power to save
[46:16] amen
[46:17] whether that's us from our life of sin
[46:20] it's us from danger it's us from our own
[46:22] stupidity whatever it is
[46:24] he's gonna he'll save us from that if
[46:27] we'll distrust him
[46:29] we've got a prayer request here it says

[49:57] it's just so wonderful and to be back
[49:59] here in the house of god with all of you
[50:00] this morning
[50:02] it's there's nothing like it saying that
[50:07] you can go to any other event you want
[50:09] whether it's a
[50:10] motivational speaker or your favorite
[50:13] sports team and yeah there will be an
[50:15] atmosphere and there'll be a charge
[50:16] you'll be happy for a moment
[50:18] but you'll never find real joy like
[50:20] there is when you gather together with
[50:22] the saints of like faith
[50:23] whether it's in a church service like
[50:26] this or you just get together with a
[50:28] brother or sister and fellowship around
[50:30] the word
[50:31] there's just such a presence and such a
[50:33] joy from that you can just you can live
[50:35] on that
[50:36] man
[50:37] let's just go ahead and read here
[50:39] matthew chapter 10 verse 9 provide
[50:42] neither gold nor silver nor brass in
[50:45] your purse
[50:46] nor script for your journey neither two
[50:48] coats neither shoes nor yet staves for
[50:51] the workman is worthy of his meat and
[50:54] we're skipping down to verse 16.
[50:56] behold i send you forth a sheep in the
[50:58] midst of wolves
[51:00] be therefore wise as serpents and
[51:02] harmless as doves but beware of men
[51:05] for they will deliver you up to the
[51:07] councils and they will scourge you in
[51:08] their synagogues and ye shall be brought
[51:11] before governors and kings for my sake
[51:14] for a testimony against them and the
[51:16] gentiles but when they deliver you up
[51:19] take no thought
[51:21] how or what ye shall speak
[51:23] for it shall be given you in that same
[51:25] hour what ye shall speak for it is not
[51:28] ye that speak
[51:30] but the spirit of your father which
[51:32] speaketh in you
[51:34] heavenly father lord we ask that you
[51:36] just come this morning and take this
[51:38] little reading of the word and just
[51:40] apply it to our hearts father take full
[51:42] control of the service we dedicate it to
[51:44] you in jesus name amen you may be seated
[51:48] i just want to take a a little thought
[51:50] this morning
[51:53] and i want to like to speak on what god
[51:55] can do with nothing
[51:57] and maybe with a sub title of don't wait
[52:02] don't wait
[52:03] okay
[52:04] and you know i was thinking about this
[52:06] and
[52:07] it was actually after
[52:09] the last wednesday night when i
[52:11] ministered here and the presence of the
[52:12] lord was just so beautiful and it was
[52:15] just amazing
[52:17] and that's nothing of myself it speaks
[52:19] more to all of you
[52:21] than anything the minister had to do
[52:23] with it
[52:24] but i was just thinking and on the
[52:26] goodness of god as i was going home
[52:29] and that's when this struck me it struck
[52:32] me so hard
[52:34] and just thinking about my own life and
[52:36] the the struggles and
[52:38] issues and things that i've had to
[52:41] overcome by his grace and by his mercy
[52:44] and i thought wow
[52:46] what god
[52:48] can do with nothing
[52:50] if we'll just turn over nothing to god
[52:54] he can do such miraculous things
[52:58] but so many so much of the time our
[53:01] problem is
[53:02] is that we think god needs something
[53:04] from us in order to for god to be
[53:07] successful
[53:09] you know and that's why we have this
[53:11] reading here in matthew matthew sent in
[53:13] matthew jesus is sending out his
[53:14] disciples
[53:16] and he's instructing them
[53:18] exactly what qualifications
[53:21] he wants them to have
[53:23] in order to serve him properly
[53:26] and what
[53:27] goods and services they should be taking
[53:29] with them
[53:33] and he starts out and he says well first
[53:35] of all don't take any gold
[53:39] right
[53:40] and
[53:41] in case you you're
[53:43] thinking well i just don't want you
[53:44] carrying large sums because that is
[53:46] dangerous
[53:47] don't take any silver either
[53:51] in case you're still stuck on that
[53:53] um don't take any brass in your purse
[53:55] like don't even take pennies
[53:57] nothing
[54:00] don't think that it's by your own
[54:04] wealth
[54:05] or your own ability
[54:07] your own
[54:08] influence what you can contribute
[54:12] is going to be of any use here
[54:16] so let's just leave that at home
[54:18] first of all
[54:19] he said then
[54:21] and i should have looked this word up
[54:22] because i i i'm sure it has a it means
[54:25] more than what i have here but nor
[54:28] script for your journey
[54:31] neither two coats
[54:33] don't don't take an extra coat
[54:36] he wanted them to to
[54:38] fly
[54:39] fast and easy and and hardly even put
[54:41] anything in their carry-on
[54:43] like don't take an extra coat neither
[54:46] shoes
[54:47] not a not an extra stave
[54:49] for the workmen is worthy of his meat
[54:51] and if you read the area in between
[54:53] there of course he talks about when you
[54:55] go into a city and and they they will
[54:57] provide for you but what he's saying is
[55:00] isn't that these individuals are going
[55:02] to provide you but he said as you do the
[55:04] work of god
[55:06] as you go out and you're doing the work
[55:07] of god
[55:09] with
[55:10] that intention and purpose in mind
[55:14] when you're going forth putting god
[55:17] first
[55:18] putting the kingdom of heaven first
[55:22] then all these things will be added to
[55:23] you
[55:25] now he doesn't tell you how much in
[55:26] abundance it'll be added to you at any
[55:28] one given time
[55:30] but he said you'll be taken care of
[55:32] you will be taken care of if you can
[55:35] move out by faith
[55:37] you see
[55:39] he said but what he's trying to drive in
[55:41] here is that if you're not moving by
[55:44] faith
[55:45] how can you preach a gospel of faith
[55:48] when you're not even living the faith
[55:52] that you're preaching
[55:54] so you before you go out and you want to
[55:57] share
[55:59] you have to at least be willing to step
[56:01] out on the same faith
[56:02] if you're asking someone to receive
[56:04] something of you
[56:06] or believe in something that you believe
[56:08] in
[56:09] you have to stand the same
[56:12] and believe this is 100 the truth
[56:15] and when i believe it's the truth then i
[56:18] don't need anything else
[56:20] you see that's where christianity
[56:23] has struggled is struggling so much
[56:25] today
[56:26] in the western world and everywhere else
[56:30] is that they have abandoned their core
[56:32] values
[56:33] and they have
[56:34] discredited
[56:36] the very gospel they claim to believe
[56:39] this is happening way back in the 50s
[56:41] and 60s
[56:42] in brother bannon's time
[56:44] when that that missionary was there and
[56:47] speaking to the muhammadan
[56:49] and telling him
[56:51] about the about christ
[56:53] and he said why don't you want to
[56:54] receive christ he said well
[56:57] he said your christ said
[57:01] gave you all these promises
[57:04] of of healing the sick and raising the
[57:06] dead and all these things when was the
[57:07] last time you saw that happen
[57:10] where's the last evidence of this
[57:14] and the brother backed down
[57:17] he backed down
[57:20] and brother branham said i wish i would
[57:22] have been there
[57:23] i wish i could have been there
[57:25] but the point is is by little by little
[57:28] there's a little song that says the the
[57:30] the sheep got out the sheep got out
[57:33] we let the we let down the bars the
[57:35] sheep got out we let down the bars the
[57:37] sheep got out but how did the goats get
[57:39] in
[57:41] because we let down the bars
[57:43] you see we stopped actually believing we
[57:45] found a way of religion
[57:48] we found a way of us to perform our own
[57:51] works we found a way for us to make
[57:53] ourselves feel good
[57:55] we found a way for us to to take
[57:59] a way of law
[58:01] just like the old testament the the
[58:03] priest of the old testament
[58:05] could take the law and use it to control
[58:07] the people
[58:10] but we no longer
[58:12] christianity is no longer holding on to
[58:17] the power
[58:19] related to the name
[58:22] because they're in name only
[58:26] you see christian they first were called
[58:28] christians in antioch
[58:31] and do you know why
[58:33] because the people of antioch said these
[58:36] people are so much like the original
[58:40] they must be
[58:41] christians like christ
[58:45] these men are like christ
[58:50] but we've
[58:51] we've
[58:52] gone so far away
[58:56] from that original
[58:59] so what we want to do is take a look
[59:00] back and see
[59:02] what was the original like what did he
[59:04] instruct us to do
[59:05] just keeping a a mind on what god can do
[59:08] with nothing
[59:10] um
[59:12] now in
[59:15] matthew 10 16 the beginning of it i i
[59:17] just i highlighted this for myself it
[59:20] says behold i send you forth a sheep in
[59:22] the midst of wolves
[59:25] and when i read that i thought wow
[59:28] none of us like that
[59:31] that that totally goes against our human
[59:34] nature
[59:36] because
[59:38] when you think about the contrast sheep
[59:40] and wolves
[59:44] one defenseless
[59:47] not able to do a whole lot its greatest
[59:50] defense
[59:51] by itself if it's all by itself is
[59:53] running away
[59:55] if it's all together is to get in a big
[59:57] circle and bunch together as tight as
[59:59] possible so that they provide as as
[1:00:03] little
[1:00:04] attack surface as possible
[1:00:06] and if the wolf dies in
[1:00:07] that it's the it's so thick in there
[1:00:10] it's smothering
[1:00:14] but wolves they have
[1:00:17] strong powerful feet and paws and
[1:00:20] and really sharp teeth
[1:00:22] and their favorite
[1:00:24] their favorite food
[1:00:25] is sheep
[1:00:27] and jesus says just just in case you're
[1:00:30] wondering how it is i'm sending you out
[1:00:33] i'm sending you out as sheep
[1:00:35] amongst wolves
[1:00:38] don't take any of your own defense
[1:00:41] so not only are you not taking any money
[1:00:44] you're not taking an extra coat
[1:00:46] so we covered all the the natural things
[1:00:49] first he covered that first
[1:00:51] and now he's diving into the spiritual
[1:00:53] things
[1:00:54] he said don't
[1:00:55] don't go out there thinking that
[1:00:57] i'm sending you of your own ability or
[1:00:59] your own prowess of your own morality or
[1:01:02] your own strength so i'm sending you a
[1:01:05] sheep amongst wolves
[1:01:08] because not because you're going to
[1:01:11] escape every persecution
[1:01:13] no
[1:01:14] no
[1:01:16] he says beware of men beware of the
[1:01:18] wolves
[1:01:20] because this is what they're going to do
[1:01:21] for they will deliver up to the council
[1:01:23] and they will scourge you in their
[1:01:24] synagogues
[1:01:28] he said you're going to get scourged
[1:01:32] he didn't
[1:01:33] like about this time you're like yeah
[1:01:35] lord where's the part where you come in
[1:01:36] and save me
[1:01:38] i said no no you're gonna get scorched
[1:01:41] yeah
[1:01:42] just
[1:01:44] it's par for the course
[1:01:48] he said you understand because you ain't
[1:01:50] there yet but just wait the
[1:01:51] crucifixion's coming and you'll
[1:01:53] understand there
[1:01:55] the the servants no greater than his
[1:01:57] lord
[1:01:59] if they called the master of the house
[1:02:01] meows above how much more those of you
[1:02:03] of his house
[1:02:07] and you should be brought before
[1:02:08] governors and kings for my sake for the
[1:02:10] testimony
[1:02:11] against them and the gentiles
[1:02:15] he's looking to spread his gospel as far
[1:02:19] and wide as possible
[1:02:21] to everybody
[1:02:23] from the lowest to the highest
[1:02:25] why so that on a day of judgment none
[1:02:28] will have any excuse
[1:02:31] that's your job
[1:02:33] that's where he's sending you forth
[1:02:35] this is why he didn't want you going
[1:02:37] with your ability
[1:02:39] because if you go with your ability how
[1:02:41] is he going to judge them
[1:02:43] a holy god
[1:02:44] judge one man off the word of another
[1:02:46] man
[1:02:48] that wouldn't be just
[1:02:51] that wouldn't be just
[1:02:54] so that's why he tells you
[1:02:56] when they deliver you up
[1:02:57] take no thought
[1:02:59] right the first thing we
[1:03:01] even even naturally we get pulled over
[1:03:02] by the police and either we know why
[1:03:04] they did it
[1:03:05] or maybe we're not sure
[1:03:08] but probably you have a pretty good idea
[1:03:10] most of the time and if not you have a
[1:03:12] guilty conscience anyways so the first
[1:03:14] thing happened you pull over and you're
[1:03:15] thinking okay what what do i need to do
[1:03:18] for the best
[1:03:20] outcome possible you know we put on our
[1:03:22] smile and we get all nice and
[1:03:25] happy and
[1:03:27] and we're not feeling real happy but you
[1:03:28] know officer comes to the window and and
[1:03:31] uh how are you officer you know
[1:03:34] i hope you're having a great day
[1:03:37] i sure am no you're not
[1:03:40] not
[1:03:41] right then
[1:03:42] right but that's our response
[1:03:45] is we're thinking okay how do i get out
[1:03:46] of this what what can i say what what's
[1:03:48] the right thing to say
[1:03:50] what how do i say it how do i word it
[1:03:53] like i'm gonna wait for them to say
[1:03:55] something first that way i just in case
[1:03:57] there didn't pull me over for what i
[1:03:59] thought they did which i know i'm guilty
[1:04:01] of
[1:04:02] i won't i won't let it slip you know
[1:04:05] but jesus said no no no in this case
[1:04:07] this is not earthly things
[1:04:10] so take no thought your only thought is
[1:04:13] lord
[1:04:15] use me
[1:04:17] that's it that's it that's your thought
[1:04:20] because the minute you inject something
[1:04:22] it's not what god can do with nothing
[1:04:24] it's what god has to do to get you back
[1:04:26] to nothing
[1:04:29] and we're going to see that as we walk
[1:04:30] through the scripture here there's
[1:04:31] there's so many examples in the
[1:04:33] scripture
[1:04:34] and i advise you
[1:04:36] i advise you there's so many examples in
[1:04:38] the scripture both
[1:04:41] of those
[1:04:42] who needed to be brought back down to
[1:04:44] nothing
[1:04:45] those
[1:04:46] who were able to submit themselves with
[1:04:48] nothing
[1:04:50] and those who thought they had
[1:04:51] everything
[1:04:53] and had to be a base i mean we just
[1:04:54] heard that on wednesday with brother dan
[1:04:56] preaching you mentioned nebuchadnezzar
[1:04:58] he mentioned king uzziah
[1:05:00] these are men who
[1:05:02] thought they had something to offer god
[1:05:08] and god had to bring him back to what
[1:05:10] nothing
[1:05:11] nothing
[1:05:13] it's not because he wants you to always
[1:05:15] have nothing
[1:05:16] but he just wants you to remember
[1:05:18] always remember
[1:05:20] that you have nothing to contribute
[1:05:22] except for what he's given you
[1:05:25] if he didn't give it to you don't try
[1:05:27] and give it back to him because he don't
[1:05:28] want it
[1:05:32] if god didn't give it to you he don't
[1:05:34] want it because only the gifts he gives
[1:05:37] you
[1:05:38] are gifts worthy of the king
[1:05:42] and the only guest worthy to give back
[1:05:43] to a king
[1:05:45] the gifts of your flesh
[1:05:47] the only reason why he wants you to give
[1:05:49] that to him is so he can throw it
[1:05:52] into
[1:05:53] the furnace and burn it away
[1:05:57] so when you try and take this something
[1:06:00] that you think you have of your own
[1:06:02] ability of your own thoughts
[1:06:06] of your own strength
[1:06:08] and you go and say here you go lord here
[1:06:10] you can use this he's like
[1:06:12] what am i going to do with that
[1:06:15] you want me to burn it you're like no no
[1:06:17] give it back give it back
[1:06:19] i i need that
[1:06:21] he's like okay well just let me know i
[1:06:23] i got a big giant furnace to take care
[1:06:26] of that thing when you're finally done
[1:06:27] with it but
[1:06:28] that's about all i know to do with that
[1:06:30] gift you were trying that thing you were
[1:06:32] trying to give me right now
[1:06:33] kind of kind of awful
[1:06:37] it kind of stunk
[1:06:40] it didn't look so good
[1:06:42] it looked like dirty rags and i'm not
[1:06:44] sure what you were wanting me to do with
[1:06:45] that
[1:06:47] i got a nice clean robe for you when
[1:06:48] you're ready
[1:06:51] but you can't wear them both at the same
[1:06:53] time
[1:06:55] you know
[1:06:57] and
[1:06:59] so talking about what
[1:07:00] god can do with nothing i i was thinking
[1:07:03] you know
[1:07:04] in order to get to the place
[1:07:06] where you realize you have nothing to
[1:07:08] give
[1:07:10] nothing to add
[1:07:13] nothing of value of yourself
[1:07:16] that god can use
[1:07:21] that's when
[1:07:22] in order to get there it takes surrender
[1:07:25] now we we've heard these words so many
[1:07:28] times
[1:07:29] surrender
[1:07:31] and and
[1:07:32] there's two there's two different types
[1:07:33] of surrender i want to mention real
[1:07:34] quick here i took them both out of i
[1:07:37] took some definitions out of the webster
[1:07:38] dictionary
[1:07:40] and that way we're all at least working
[1:07:42] off the same place here
[1:07:44] okay
[1:07:45] the first definition is the one i would
[1:07:47] attribute to what god is doing for us
[1:07:50] and what he would like out of us
[1:07:52] it's the action of yielding one's person
[1:07:54] or giving up the possession of something
[1:07:56] especially into the power of another
[1:08:01] you see that first one here
[1:08:04] is you yielding
[1:08:06] of your own free will
[1:08:09] now the second one
[1:08:11] is your only other choice
[1:08:13] if you don't choose to yield to god
[1:08:17] is the yield to the power control or
[1:08:20] possession upon compulsion or demand
[1:08:26] and that's the devil
[1:08:29] you only have two choices
[1:08:31] there's no third choice there's no
[1:08:32] sitting on the fence
[1:08:34] you can either yield willingly to the
[1:08:36] lord because brother brahm said that
[1:08:38] holy spirit he's a gentleman
[1:08:41] he'll never come in and take you
[1:08:44] of his own ability of his own power
[1:08:47] he's waiting for you to say lord i
[1:08:49] surrender
[1:08:51] i surrender
[1:08:53] but so many times we're like we're like
[1:08:56] that kid
[1:08:57] that you know rebellious teenager
[1:09:00] and we run out
[1:09:02] and we do all the things our parents
[1:09:03] told us not to do and we get into
[1:09:05] trouble
[1:09:06] and then we turn on to our parents say
[1:09:08] if you love me
[1:09:10] you wouldn't let me do this or at least
[1:09:12] when it happened you'd come save me
[1:09:14] and your parents like no you did it you
[1:09:16] suffered the consequences
[1:09:17] i still love you but because i love you
[1:09:20] that you're going through this
[1:09:22] and i'll still love you when you're done
[1:09:24] going through this
[1:09:25] and when you decide
[1:09:28] to yield of yourself
[1:09:31] to the power of another
[1:09:34] then your life will change
[1:09:36] but right now
[1:09:38] you don't realize that you think you're
[1:09:39] making your own decisions but you're
[1:09:41] yielding your power your yourself
[1:09:45] under
[1:09:46] compulsion
[1:09:47] under demand
[1:09:48] you know why because you no longer have
[1:09:51] a choice
[1:09:53] once you yield in that direction you no
[1:09:55] longer have a choice
[1:09:57] on what your actions are going to be
[1:10:00] right that's the it's the it's the
[1:10:01] cliche saying that you hear all the time
[1:10:04] sin will take you
[1:10:06] deeper and further than you ever
[1:10:07] intended to go
[1:10:09] why
[1:10:10] because it's upon compulsion
[1:10:12] and or demand
[1:10:14] once you start going there once you
[1:10:17] yield initially
[1:10:19] you're no longer in control
[1:10:22] now
[1:10:23] here too
[1:10:24] once you yield
[1:10:26] 100 you fully surrender you're also no
[1:10:28] longer in control
[1:10:31] but he's never gonna force you ever
[1:10:34] at any point you're like you know what
[1:10:35] lord that you know i don't i don't i'm
[1:10:37] not gonna i just don't feel comfortable
[1:10:39] going there he's gonna be like well it's
[1:10:41] gonna be a lot better for you
[1:10:43] but i'm not going to force you he'll
[1:10:45] just let you sit there right where
[1:10:47] you're at
[1:10:48] in your place of complacency
[1:10:51] waiting for you to surrender a little
[1:10:53] bit more
[1:10:55] the opposite is
[1:10:56] with the devil as you start going down
[1:10:58] that road
[1:11:00] and you know you're hanging out with
[1:11:01] those friends you're hanging out with
[1:11:02] that influence or whatever it is that's
[1:11:04] taking you in whatever direction it is
[1:11:10] and
[1:11:11] you're gonna go like i'm not comfortable
[1:11:12] with that
[1:11:14] and they won't stop until you do it
[1:11:18] go a little bit further and once you go
[1:11:20] a little bit further you go a little bit
[1:11:22] further i want you a little bit further
[1:11:23] you go a little bit further but they're
[1:11:25] never less like
[1:11:26] oh
[1:11:28] you're not comfortable uh since you're
[1:11:30] not comfortable with with with this
[1:11:33] that must mean you're a pretty good guy
[1:11:35] i'll just leave you alone
[1:11:37] it's never been the case not in my
[1:11:38] experience
[1:11:41] you know you only like little lies
[1:11:44] oh
[1:11:46] well don't tell any big ones then
[1:11:49] just stick to your little lies
[1:11:51] it's not the way it works it's like
[1:11:54] you're the little lie
[1:11:56] and then the lie gets a little bit
[1:11:57] bigger
[1:11:58] and the lie gets a little bit bigger
[1:12:00] and then your lies are so off they start
[1:12:04] where where satan started with eve one
[1:12:06] word different and you're like it's one
[1:12:08] word what's the problem
[1:12:10] you know it was kind of the truth
[1:12:13] you see but the minute you have to
[1:12:14] insert kind of
[1:12:17] sort of
[1:12:20] similar to
[1:12:22] there's been a deviation
[1:12:25] and the minute you add a deviation
[1:12:29] into the truth
[1:12:31] it makes it all a
[1:12:34] lie so now all of a sudden you get to
[1:12:37] such a point where if you don't
[1:12:40] make a choice
[1:12:42] to surrender the other direction
[1:12:45] where god can start working with you
[1:12:49] then what's going to happen is you get
[1:12:51] so far
[1:12:53] you
[1:12:54] like the devil start believing your own
[1:12:56] lies
[1:12:58] you know the devil
[1:12:59] he reads the scripture
[1:13:01] but he's so invested in his own lie
[1:13:05] he believes it
[1:13:08] he really believes
[1:13:10] that he's got a chance
[1:13:12] at the end of
[1:13:14] of time
[1:13:15] to beat god
[1:13:20] he believes it
[1:13:22] he really does
[1:13:24] you know how i know
[1:13:25] is he's persisted for over 6 000 years
[1:13:29] through millions of miracles
[1:13:33] that were not in his favor
[1:13:35] and through a whole ton of failure on
[1:13:37] his part
[1:13:39] he's never once
[1:13:41] turned a son or daughter of god
[1:13:44] to not be a son or daughter of god
[1:13:46] and yet somehow he thinks
[1:13:49] that at the end of time when all the
[1:13:51] sons and daughters of god are together
[1:13:53] with god again
[1:13:54] somehow he'll be able to influence them
[1:13:57] through some type of power
[1:14:00] and change them all at once
[1:14:03] because he keeps fighting
[1:14:08] and that's
[1:14:09] until you stop fighting god
[1:14:12] and surrender
[1:14:15] that's where you're at too
[1:14:18] we keep fighting god
[1:14:20] thinking that if we keep doing it our
[1:14:22] way eventually it'll turn out right
[1:14:26] because we don't want to give up of our
[1:14:28] own thoughts our own ability our own
[1:14:30] doing our own direction in life we're
[1:14:33] like
[1:14:33] this is you know
[1:14:35] we're we're locked in
[1:14:38] it's like a career
[1:14:39] and and we feel like well we can't stop
[1:14:41] we've gone so we're so invested in this
[1:14:43] career now
[1:14:45] that if i
[1:14:46] i have to give all this up
[1:14:49] in order to do something different
[1:14:52] and when i do that i lose all my
[1:14:54] investment
[1:14:57] they say that is how
[1:14:59] the biggest losses are made
[1:15:01] in investing
[1:15:04] is that once someone is invested in
[1:15:06] something even when it starts to go down
[1:15:11] they're so invested they're more likely
[1:15:13] to invest more hoping it'll come back up
[1:15:19] than to cut it loose
[1:15:24] because it become a part of who they are
[1:15:27] a part of their self-worth a part of
[1:15:29] their identity
[1:15:32] and it hurts so much to cut it loose
[1:15:37] and we all get there
[1:15:39] we all get there
[1:15:41] whether that's
[1:15:42] a in you know even in in
[1:15:45] an actual job in an actual career
[1:15:49] you know i can speak a little bit from
[1:15:50] experience
[1:15:53] i
[1:15:55] growing up worked for my my dad who was
[1:15:57] a general contractor
[1:15:59] and i
[1:16:00] started working when i was like seven
[1:16:02] years old he would haul me off to work i
[1:16:04] don't know how much work how much work i
[1:16:05] was actually doing and how much work i
[1:16:07] just was additional
[1:16:09] um
[1:16:10] but
[1:16:11] by the time i got
[1:16:13] into my early 20s i had had
[1:16:16] 10 years of full-time employment on the
[1:16:18] job
[1:16:19] with a highly trained individual
[1:16:22] well worth
[1:16:25] what i was doing i knew
[1:16:27] how to to work i knew how to get things
[1:16:30] done i had several skills
[1:16:33] and all that's going on
[1:16:35] i was getting paid
[1:16:36] equal
[1:16:37] to anyone else in the industry
[1:16:40] and not just working for my dad
[1:16:43] going out and working for other
[1:16:44] contractors working for people
[1:16:46] and and the point of that is
[1:16:48] is i had to make an active decision
[1:16:51] because i looked at some things and i
[1:16:53] looked at the end point for many of
[1:16:54] these men
[1:16:56] and i said most of these men
[1:16:58] end up in the end of their life in a way
[1:17:00] that i do not want to
[1:17:04] i said so i have to make an active
[1:17:06] change
[1:17:09] and that active change required me to go
[1:17:11] from what would be considered
[1:17:14] close to the top
[1:17:16] where people will ask your opinion
[1:17:18] ask your advice
[1:17:20] ask you how to do things you're the one
[1:17:23] actually giving some leadership
[1:17:25] down to the bottom
[1:17:28] you have to go back down to the bottom
[1:17:30] and be humble and say i don't know what
[1:17:32] i'm doing but i'm here to learn
[1:17:34] i don't know what i'm doing but you just
[1:17:36] tell me and i'm willing to follow your
[1:17:39] instruction
[1:17:41] you see and that's where so many of us
[1:17:44] our struggle is with with full surrender
[1:17:48] is that
[1:17:50] we're like
[1:17:51] but i have to give up
[1:17:54] by
[1:17:56] my influence maybe i'll have to give up
[1:17:58] my authority maybe i'll have to give up
[1:18:01] whether that's over your own life or
[1:18:02] you're scared you're going to lose some
[1:18:03] type of influence or authority with
[1:18:05] others or you're going to lose some type
[1:18:06] of prestige because now they're going to
[1:18:08] realize that wow he's not that guy he's
[1:18:11] kind of weird that guy i thought he was
[1:18:14] you know and maybe we've been in the
[1:18:15] message for 20 years
[1:18:18] maybe we've been in 10 years
[1:18:20] maybe we've grown up in the message
[1:18:22] maybe we've been reading our bible
[1:18:24] we've been listening to the message
[1:18:26] we've been in sunday school we've we we
[1:18:29] know the the seven seals book
[1:18:32] we've read the church ages two or three
[1:18:34] times as a child
[1:18:39] and you're like
[1:18:41] even for that
[1:18:43] you're like i've done everything i
[1:18:44] should do
[1:18:45] and the devil be like well you you go to
[1:18:48] give your life to christ and ask to be
[1:18:50] baptized they're going to know you're a
[1:18:51] sinner
[1:18:53] like they think you're a pretty good kid
[1:18:55] right now
[1:18:56] but you're gonna have to make a public
[1:19:00] um
[1:19:00] confession
[1:19:02] that you're not as good as they all
[1:19:04] as they all think you are
[1:19:08] don't worry about it
[1:19:09] they were all kids
[1:19:11] they've all everyone in this building
[1:19:14] who's gone on with the lord
[1:19:19] their backstory
[1:19:20] may surprise you
[1:19:22] you see that's the biggest misconception
[1:19:24] of people coming to church
[1:19:27] is is i've heard this statement over the
[1:19:30] time and over years
[1:19:32] both from people coming just starting to
[1:19:34] come to church or come to know the lord
[1:19:36] and from people who have gone out
[1:19:39] perhaps away from the church and are
[1:19:41] thinking about coming back
[1:19:43] and they say well
[1:19:46] i don't know that i can come there
[1:19:48] because all you people
[1:19:50] are such good people
[1:19:53] and saints and i just don't know that i
[1:19:55] fit in
[1:19:56] and it's like
[1:19:58] that is a lie of the devil
[1:20:01] he said because
[1:20:03] we we are all saints
[1:20:05] but it ain't because we're good people
[1:20:08] we're all saints by the blood of the
[1:20:11] lamb
[1:20:12] and you know how long it takes you to
[1:20:14] join that same rank
[1:20:16] just surrender
[1:20:18] surrender and come under the blood of
[1:20:20] the lamb
[1:20:21] and you'll look as bright and shiny as
[1:20:23] new as everyone else
[1:20:26] it don't matter
[1:20:27] the back story then is is wash clean
[1:20:30] your backstory is the same as theirs
[1:20:34] is that the price was paid on calvary
[1:20:37] and you are justified
[1:20:39] you are sanctified
[1:20:41] and now you're primed and ready for the
[1:20:44] baptism of the holy ghost what only
[1:20:46] matters now
[1:20:48] is how fast you want to go
[1:20:54] you know so many of so many times are
[1:20:56] like someone learning to ride a bike and
[1:21:00] we come to a hill
[1:21:03] and we go to ride down the hill now you
[1:21:06] don't need to pedal
[1:21:07] the power of the hill is going to carry
[1:21:10] you down
[1:21:12] but the problem with most
[1:21:15] is that
[1:21:16] because they don't fully trust
[1:21:20] they have fear that creeps in
[1:21:22] a little bit of doubt
[1:21:24] they've never moved that fast before
[1:21:28] is that they hold their breaks the whole
[1:21:29] way down
[1:21:31] and they lose out on the experience they
[1:21:33] could have had
[1:21:37] all because of fear
[1:21:39] now i know this is all
[1:21:41] perhaps sounding really simple but it's
[1:21:43] a simple gospel
[1:21:45] you know i and yet at the same time
[1:21:48] this is the seven seals
[1:21:52] you say wow brother how do you what do
[1:21:54] you mean
[1:21:55] the seven seals i thought those were
[1:21:57] mysterious things
[1:21:59] they are
[1:22:02] to people who to whom they are mysteries
[1:22:04] to
[1:22:05] but to whom
[1:22:07] that the arm of the lord will be
[1:22:09] revealed they're revealed
[1:22:11] and you know what brother random said
[1:22:13] the seven seals were
[1:22:14] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:18] and forever
[1:22:20] so how do you know if if whether or not
[1:22:22] you understand all the types and the
[1:22:24] symbols and the terminology and all that
[1:22:27] if if you have a revelation of the seven
[1:22:29] seals do you have a revelation of jesus
[1:22:32] christ in your life
[1:22:33] is he living out through your life so if
[1:22:36] so if that is so
[1:22:38] those seven seals are being unveiled and
[1:22:41] living through you right now and you
[1:22:44] don't even know it
[1:22:46] because that's what the type of belief
[1:22:47] and faith god is calling us to
[1:22:50] is not one where we need to figure it
[1:22:51] out oh it's beautiful i love the
[1:22:53] ministers that have a ministry and they
[1:22:55] come and they bring all the symbols and
[1:22:57] the types together you can watch them
[1:22:58] just fit them in there and type it out
[1:23:01] through history and it's beautiful
[1:23:03] it's
[1:23:04] beautiful but god doesn't require you
[1:23:08] to know all that
[1:23:10] in order to be a fulfillment of the
[1:23:12] prophecy that's in them
[1:23:15] he said just believe
[1:23:17] just believe so here we are surrender
[1:23:20] now in order to surrender we have to
[1:23:22] trust
[1:23:23] okay
[1:23:24] now the definition of trust
[1:23:27] is assured reliance on the character
[1:23:30] ability strength or truth of someone or
[1:23:34] something
[1:23:36] it is also one in which confidence is
[1:23:39] placed
[1:23:41] and also dependence
[1:23:43] on something future or contingent
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] no many of us use this word in our daily
[1:23:50] life all the time
[1:23:53] right whether it's dealing with one
[1:23:54] another or or someone says hey you know
[1:23:57] i'll meet you such and such a place i'll
[1:23:59] have this stuff or i'll do this for you
[1:24:00] and you said yeah i trust you
[1:24:02] i believe you you'll be there
[1:24:07] but our trust is kind of shaky a lot of
[1:24:10] times
[1:24:11] you say yeah i trust you
[1:24:14] to a point
[1:24:18] and that's not the trust god's looking
[1:24:20] for
[1:24:21] you see
[1:24:23] is our trust
[1:24:25] in relation to the lord
[1:24:27] is based on what we've already
[1:24:29] experienced with him
[1:24:33] you see and it's a very shallow trust
[1:24:35] sometimes
[1:24:37] as we say you know lord i trust you for
[1:24:39] for all my my needs my
[1:24:41] uh and to supply my needs and my income
[1:24:44] and supply for my family
[1:24:47] and then we spend most of our time
[1:24:48] worrying about it
[1:24:52] i thought
[1:24:53] you said
[1:24:55] you trusted
[1:24:59] i thought you said you trusted him to
[1:25:02] supply your needs
[1:25:04] what are you doing worrying
[1:25:06] because worrying is a breakdown of doubt
[1:25:10] worrying is a part of fear
[1:25:12] fear and worry are one and the same
[1:25:16] so where there's fear
[1:25:18] and worry there's doubt
[1:25:20] so you don't have total trust
[1:25:24] you say lord i trust you for my healing
[1:25:28] but then we're concerned about how he's
[1:25:31] going to do it lord i don't know if you
[1:25:32] really can do this what do i need to do
[1:25:35] to help you
[1:25:38] trust trust me
[1:25:41] trust me that whether by miracle or by
[1:25:44] way that i will send you to the right
[1:25:46] dentist
[1:25:48] you're going to be healed
[1:25:50] trust
[1:25:52] don't worry just trust
[1:25:56] he's there for you even if you go to the
[1:25:58] wrong doctor
[1:26:01] and you're trusting god
[1:26:04] you got a
[1:26:06] promise of healing
[1:26:08] it's like when you go to church
[1:26:10] and you go into a service
[1:26:12] brother branham said even if the
[1:26:15] minister behind the pulpit isn't living
[1:26:17] right
[1:26:18] doesn't have the right doctrine is not
[1:26:20] of the right spirit
[1:26:22] he is 100 off the word
[1:26:25] he said if you walk in there
[1:26:27] really prayed up
[1:26:28] trusting in god for something that you
[1:26:30] need for your life
[1:26:32] that man can't help
[1:26:34] but say what it is because god will use
[1:26:37] him to speak to you
[1:26:41] doesn't mean everything he says
[1:26:42] throughout that service will be right
[1:26:44] but god will use him in a certain point
[1:26:46] in time to speak directly to your need
[1:26:49] because you trust
[1:26:51] but many a times
[1:26:53] god isn't able to speak to our needs
[1:26:56] even when the man behind the pulpit is
[1:26:58] prayed up of the right spirit and has
[1:27:00] put his time into the word
[1:27:02] because we don't trust
[1:27:05] we are so anxious and worried
[1:27:08] that maybe this person might lead us
[1:27:10] astray
[1:27:13] because god is not in control
[1:27:18] now i'm not saying that if you see
[1:27:20] someone you go in somewhere and they're
[1:27:21] preaching the wrong things in the wrong
[1:27:23] doctrines and you see the lives of the
[1:27:24] people all over the place that you you
[1:27:26] just stay there
[1:27:27] what i'm saying in a certain specific
[1:27:30] instant in time
[1:27:32] if you go in
[1:27:34] having a need from god
[1:27:37] god is obligated to meet you there
[1:27:40] if you actually trust
[1:27:43] now i'm using the word trust
[1:27:45] because it's a it's a it's a it's a
[1:27:47] simpler word that we use all the time
[1:27:49] that we can associate with that we even
[1:27:51] associate with one another
[1:27:53] right
[1:27:55] but
[1:27:56] the word that we actually use for this
[1:27:58] all the time is faith
[1:28:02] you know what what faith faith only has
[1:28:04] one actual meaning
[1:28:08] and that is
[1:28:10] complete
[1:28:11] trust
[1:28:15] like we make faith a very mystical thing
[1:28:19] a thing out beyond our reach or
[1:28:20] something that's like just it it's it's
[1:28:23] it's it's not
[1:28:25] brother branham faith said faith is so
[1:28:27] simple that we use it every day
[1:28:31] we use it every day when you walked out
[1:28:33] to your car this morning as long as it's
[1:28:35] something that
[1:28:36] normally starts for you
[1:28:40] when you put in the key you didn't you
[1:28:42] didn't now some of us and i've been in
[1:28:44] cars like this before some of us do not
[1:28:46] have faith when we get in our car
[1:28:50] we slide the key and we're like okay
[1:28:51] buddy here you go i believe in you you
[1:28:53] can do this
[1:28:55] you don't have faith
[1:28:58] you have hope
[1:28:59] that that thing will start
[1:29:01] but many of us every single day from the
[1:29:04] time we wake up
[1:29:05] in the morning
[1:29:07] when we went to bed at night we had
[1:29:09] faith we were going to get up the next
[1:29:10] morning
[1:29:12] most of us did
[1:29:15] we didn't think oh man i better not go
[1:29:16] to sleep because i don't know if i'm
[1:29:17] going to wake up in the morning
[1:29:19] how many of you last night were like i'm
[1:29:21] not going to bed because i do not know
[1:29:24] whether or not i'm getting up in the
[1:29:25] morning
[1:29:27] i didn't
[1:29:28] my head hit the pillow and i was out
[1:29:33] now some of us stay up longer because we
[1:29:35] worry about other things we're not
[1:29:37] worried about whether or not we're going
[1:29:38] to wake up in the morning
[1:29:39] we're worrying about all the other
[1:29:40] things that we shouldn't know which is
[1:29:42] stopping us from getting the rest we
[1:29:43] need so we can wake up in the morning
[1:29:45] but we're not worried about waking up in
[1:29:47] the morning
[1:29:48] we just have a common
[1:29:50] faith a complete trust
[1:29:54] come morning i'm going to wake up
[1:29:58] and then we get up
[1:30:00] and you go to your the bathroom or go to
[1:30:02] the kitchen or wherever you head first
[1:30:05] and you turn on the the faucet at the
[1:30:07] tap
[1:30:08] and water comes out
[1:30:11] now you don't have any special prayer
[1:30:13] before you turn the knob on that faucet
[1:30:16] like saint i know this is really simple
[1:30:19] but it's this this simple
[1:30:23] it's it's this simple
[1:30:26] it's not some type of abracadabra
[1:30:29] magical thing
[1:30:33] it's simple
[1:30:35] faith
[1:30:36] simple faith is complete trust
[1:30:39] complete trust that's why god compared
[1:30:44] wanted us to be like little children
[1:30:47] in our trust in our faith of him
[1:30:51] little kids
[1:30:53] they say little kids
[1:30:55] are not born with any fear
[1:30:59] all fear is learned
[1:31:04] you learned to fear
[1:31:08] whatever fears your
[1:31:10] anxieties or worries you have you
[1:31:12] learned that
[1:31:14] that was taught to you either by someone
[1:31:18] by an experience
[1:31:20] if you have a fear of
[1:31:22] of
[1:31:26] small spaces you have a fear of of
[1:31:29] really fast speed you have a fear of um
[1:31:33] whatever it might be
[1:31:35] put it in there
[1:31:38] you learn that from someone you have a
[1:31:40] fear of dogs
[1:31:42] right most people that you find that are
[1:31:45] afraid of dogs children that are afraid
[1:31:47] of dogs
[1:31:49] watch their parents
[1:31:52] they're also afraid of dogs
[1:31:55] so for that child
[1:31:57] that fear typically has nothing to do
[1:31:59] with a negative experience that they've
[1:32:00] had
[1:32:02] but they learned it by copying someone
[1:32:05] else
[1:32:07] and that's where most of us are at
[1:32:10] most of our worries about our life we
[1:32:12] learn from people we learn from
[1:32:14] associates we learn from
[1:32:18] friends and family
[1:32:20] we learn from some type of experience
[1:32:22] that we then accredit it to
[1:32:26] you know
[1:32:28] it's a fear we learn it
[1:32:30] but god says i want you to go all the
[1:32:32] way back before that
[1:32:35] to the time when you were a child
[1:32:37] i want you to trust me like a little
[1:32:40] child
[1:32:41] i want you to get up to the edge of that
[1:32:44] that counter
[1:32:45] i want you to get to the edge of that
[1:32:47] playset
[1:32:48] and just leap off without even warning
[1:32:50] me
[1:32:52] because you have so much trust that even
[1:32:54] though you didn't say hey i'm jumping
[1:32:56] i'm going to catch you anyways
[1:33:00] because that's the faith and trust a
[1:33:02] little child has in his parents
[1:33:05] right
[1:33:06] that's why you see these these videos of
[1:33:08] of of of dads of uh with amazing feats
[1:33:11] and it's always like the the kid will do
[1:33:14] something and
[1:33:15] go flying off the couch or off of
[1:33:16] something and the dad without seeing
[1:33:18] anything just spins around and catches
[1:33:20] them right
[1:33:22] god said that's the kind of trust i want
[1:33:23] you to have in me
[1:33:26] that's that is faith that is complete
[1:33:29] trust
[1:33:31] it's not it's you don't even have to
[1:33:32] warn him lord i'm gonna take a jump i'm
[1:33:36] going to dive off of this thing because
[1:33:37] i know you got me
[1:33:40] so many times you're like lord hey um
[1:33:42] i'm thinking about doing this what do
[1:33:43] you think
[1:33:45] and he's like yeah sure do it
[1:33:48] and we're like are you really sure
[1:33:50] because um maybe you could give me some
[1:33:52] assurity
[1:33:54] how do i know you're gonna catch me
[1:33:56] and this is not new
[1:33:58] this this thought process is not new
[1:34:00] this goes all the way back into the old
[1:34:02] testament i got some examples but i'm
[1:34:05] going to have to speed up
[1:34:07] but this goes all the way back into the
[1:34:09] old testament and maybe i won't use my
[1:34:10] notes i'll just run off of them
[1:34:12] with moses
[1:34:14] moses right here's someone
[1:34:16] who had everything
[1:34:19] and thought he could do it himself
[1:34:21] he thought he could do it himself
[1:34:24] he had so much confidence in himself
[1:34:28] he had so much faith in himself and his
[1:34:30] own ability he said i can do this
[1:34:34] see he had misplaced trust
[1:34:38] he put in his own ability instead of
[1:34:40] putting it in god
[1:34:42] and god said that's not going to work
[1:34:44] he said if god said if i support that
[1:34:46] one time you're never going to learn and
[1:34:48] you're never going to come to a full
[1:34:49] maturity where real power is at
[1:34:54] you're going to be hanging out these
[1:34:55] lower levels the rest of your life so
[1:34:57] i'm going to have to let you fall on
[1:34:58] your face once and find out
[1:35:01] your ability has nothing to do with this
[1:35:04] and he goes out and he kills one
[1:35:05] egyptian
[1:35:07] think about it he thought if i kill one
[1:35:10] of them it's going to make a difference
[1:35:13] this is a such a powerful kingdom that
[1:35:16] they are holding two million people in
[1:35:19] bondage
[1:35:21] and he killed one
[1:35:23] and he didn't even it's not like he went
[1:35:24] and killed pharaoh he didn't cut the
[1:35:26] head off he killed one pass master out
[1:35:30] in the field he was just better than the
[1:35:31] just slightly better than the slaves
[1:35:36] to pharaoh
[1:35:37] they were all slaves to pharaoh
[1:35:40] it's just the jews were the
[1:35:43] ones at the very bottom
[1:35:45] everyone beat up on them
[1:35:48] and moses thought you know what i'll
[1:35:50] kill this one guy and it'll make a big
[1:35:53] difference watch
[1:35:55] and the minute he did that he realized
[1:35:57] his mistake
[1:35:59] and all the fear
[1:36:00] and doubt and worry set in
[1:36:03] and he started hiding it you ever doing
[1:36:06] something
[1:36:07] that god's told you to do
[1:36:08] no matter what it is
[1:36:10] you're not going to hide it
[1:36:12] you're not even worried
[1:36:14] when god tells you to do something you
[1:36:16] go do it right out in the open
[1:36:19] that's the difference
[1:36:21] when you do it by your own ability and
[1:36:22] it all goes wrong you're looking for a
[1:36:24] place someone to blame somewhere to hide
[1:36:26] it somewhere to place it
[1:36:28] real quick
[1:36:29] and then you know try and go walking
[1:36:31] away like nothing happened and hope
[1:36:32] nobody noticed but someone noticed
[1:36:38] not only did other egyptians notice but
[1:36:41] the very people he was supposed to be
[1:36:42] helping deliver and be an example to
[1:36:45] noticed
[1:36:48] and you know they saw him the same way
[1:36:50] they saw the taskmaster
[1:36:52] he didn't look like any savior to them
[1:36:55] he just looked like another abuser
[1:37:00] and here he goes he goes off into the
[1:37:02] wilderness he's driven off into the
[1:37:04] wilderness you know that was just the
[1:37:06] grace of god
[1:37:09] they should have put him to death for
[1:37:11] murder
[1:37:13] but the grace of god
[1:37:15] saved him from himself
[1:37:17] and sent him out into the desert pharaoh
[1:37:19] didn't send him into the desert
[1:37:21] god sent him out into the desert
[1:37:24] he said here's where we begin little by
[1:37:26] little
[1:37:27] we're going to dismantle this thing
[1:37:29] until you're down to nothing
[1:37:32] now you're done to nothing
[1:37:34] 40 years later god's like okay you're
[1:37:37] about at the point where i can actually
[1:37:38] start doing something
[1:37:42] 40 years
[1:37:48] and here he is brother man says he's an
[1:37:51] 80 year old man
[1:37:54] beard down to his knees
[1:37:57] he doesn't look like much
[1:38:00] staff in his hand out herding sheep
[1:38:04] he didn't exactly have an illustrious
[1:38:06] job
[1:38:07] in fact
[1:38:09] god knew what he was doing
[1:38:11] because the egyptians from whom he had
[1:38:13] learned all his
[1:38:14] knowledge saw sheep and sheep hurting
[1:38:18] as an abomination
[1:38:20] so god sent him out
[1:38:22] brought abased him so low
[1:38:25] that he put him in charge of the things
[1:38:28] that
[1:38:29] those who he once looked up to
[1:38:32] would just despise him for
[1:38:34] and that even in at the beginning when
[1:38:37] he still felt like he had a little bit
[1:38:38] to himself
[1:38:39] every time he started to feel like
[1:38:41] maybe i still have a little bit he'd
[1:38:43] look out and he's like i'm hurting sheep
[1:38:46] i'm an abomination to myself
[1:38:51] 40 years of that
[1:38:52] and now he's there before a burning bush
[1:38:59] and
[1:39:00] god began speaking to him
[1:39:04] in exodus
[1:39:07] and
[1:39:07] exodus chapter 4
[1:39:09] and moses answered and said but behold
[1:39:12] they will not believe me nor hearken
[1:39:14] unto my voice
[1:39:16] for they will say the lord hath not
[1:39:17] appeared unto thee
[1:39:20] moses is in a good spot for god to use
[1:39:22] him
[1:39:23] he's no longer in the spot saying look
[1:39:25] at me guys
[1:39:26] you should just believe me because
[1:39:29] i'm moses
[1:39:30] why wouldn't you believe me
[1:39:32] but here's god he's standing before a
[1:39:34] burning bush
[1:39:36] a supernatural event
[1:39:38] and
[1:39:39] he has had so much taken out of him he's
[1:39:42] been so abased
[1:39:43] that even after a supernatural
[1:39:45] experience
[1:39:47] he tells the lord lord
[1:39:49] they're not going to believe me
[1:39:51] who am i that they would believe me
[1:39:53] why would they believe me that i tell
[1:39:55] them something miraculous happened to me
[1:39:57] do i look like anything like anyone that
[1:39:59] something miraculous would happen to
[1:40:02] and the lord said unto him what is that
[1:40:05] in thine hand and he said a rod
[1:40:08] and as we would continue reading we all
[1:40:11] know the story and if you don't you
[1:40:12] should go read it go read exodus chapter
[1:40:14] four
[1:40:16] where god has them cast the rod down and
[1:40:18] it turns into a serpent
[1:40:21] moses didn't of himself just run over
[1:40:23] and pick up the serpent right away
[1:40:25] he was scared
[1:40:27] something really
[1:40:29] crazy just happened in front of him and
[1:40:31] now he's got a serpent the thing that
[1:40:33] he's been trying to protect his sheep
[1:40:34] from for the last 40 years
[1:40:36] running around on the ground right next
[1:40:38] to him
[1:40:40] and it happened out of the thing in his
[1:40:41] hand
[1:40:42] so now he's got all these thoughts like
[1:40:44] how long have been holding this snake
[1:40:45] and didn't know it
[1:40:49] right and
[1:40:51] god tells him now you pick it up
[1:40:53] god is now rebuilding moses
[1:40:57] he's rebuilding his confidence
[1:40:59] not in moses
[1:41:01] but in
[1:41:02] god
[1:41:04] you see we have to get so low
[1:41:06] that when the lord tells us
[1:41:08] why don't you go talk to someone lord
[1:41:10] they'll never believe me
[1:41:11] he said yeah they will
[1:41:13] because it's not you
[1:41:16] it doesn't have to do with you take no
[1:41:18] thought
[1:41:20] you go
[1:41:22] i'll speak
[1:41:25] you see
[1:41:25] you jump down
[1:41:27] to
[1:41:29] they've gone through all these signs
[1:41:31] there's a snake a leprosy in his hand he
[1:41:33] tells him you're gonna pour out water
[1:41:34] and he'll turn to blood he's seen all
[1:41:36] these things and moses is still
[1:41:38] struggling
[1:41:39] moses is still struggling
[1:41:42] and
[1:41:44] the lord tells him
[1:41:47] and moses said of the lord oh my lord
[1:41:49] verse 10
[1:41:51] i am not eloquent
[1:41:53] neither here to for
[1:41:55] nor since
[1:41:57] thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i
[1:41:59] am slow of speech and slow of tongue
[1:42:03] moses brother ram told us
[1:42:06] used to teach the teachers of egypt
[1:42:12] and 40 years later
[1:42:14] he says i'm not eloquent i'm i'm slow
[1:42:17] with speech the only people i talk to
[1:42:18] anymore is these sheep
[1:42:21] i think real slow
[1:42:23] how am i going to do this
[1:42:25] and now the lord
[1:42:27] gets frustrated with him and the lord
[1:42:29] said unto him who hath made man's mouth
[1:42:33] or who maketh the dumb or death
[1:42:36] or the seen or the blind
[1:42:38] have not i the
[1:42:40] lord
[1:42:42] now therefore go
[1:42:44] and i will be thy mouth and teach thee
[1:42:46] what thou shalt say
[1:42:50] lord says you're still not getting it
[1:42:53] i got you to nothing because this is
[1:42:55] where i need you
[1:42:56] now i just need you to do as you're told
[1:43:01] go where i tell you
[1:43:03] and then say what i tell you
[1:43:05] and you won't have any more problems
[1:43:06] your problems before is you went where
[1:43:08] you wanted to go and you said what you
[1:43:10] wanted to say
[1:43:11] and that's what landed you here
[1:43:14] if you would have known
[1:43:16] to do what i told you
[1:43:18] and say what i said in the beginning we
[1:43:20] wouldn't have had to go this route
[1:43:24] but now that we're here the reason why
[1:43:26] this is going to succeed moses
[1:43:29] doesn't have to do with your ability
[1:43:32] and it doesn't have to do with your
[1:43:34] inability either
[1:43:38] see what god can do with nothing so many
[1:43:40] times
[1:43:41] we're
[1:43:43] either concerned because we feel like
[1:43:45] why i don't have the ability to do that
[1:43:47] i don't have that talent i don't have
[1:43:49] that gift i don't have this or that and
[1:43:52] god's saying go
[1:43:53] go
[1:43:56] i'll speak through you
[1:43:58] i will work my gifts through you you
[1:44:01] don't need your own gift
[1:44:03] but the gift that i'll give you when you
[1:44:04] have need of it
[1:44:06] go
[1:44:09] in fact we're better off
[1:44:11] that you're dumb
[1:44:13] and don't speak
[1:44:15] except for when i speak
[1:44:18] so that's a that's actually a plus
[1:44:21] so don't worry about that bit that's on
[1:44:23] purpose
[1:44:25] i don't want you saying your own words
[1:44:26] that's why we went through this process
[1:44:28] to make you
[1:44:30] make sure you weren't eloquent and we're
[1:44:31] slow of speech because if you're slow of
[1:44:34] speech i can jump in before you say
[1:44:35] something stupid
[1:44:41] now you would think
[1:44:42] mo god just told moses i'm going to
[1:44:44] speak through you i'm going to be your
[1:44:46] mouth that would be enough
[1:44:48] and he said oh my lord send i pray thee
[1:44:51] by the hand of him who thou shalt send
[1:44:55] and the anger of the lord was kindled
[1:44:57] against moses he said is not aaron the
[1:45:00] levite thy brother
[1:45:01] i know that he can speak well
[1:45:04] and also behold
[1:45:06] he cometh forth to meet thee and when he
[1:45:08] seeth thee he will be glad in his heart
[1:45:11] and thou shalt speak unto him and put
[1:45:13] words in his mouth and i will put be
[1:45:15] with thy mouth and with
[1:45:17] his mouth and tell teach you what you
[1:45:20] shall do
[1:45:22] you see no matter how many excuses you
[1:45:24] have if god has a work for you to do
[1:45:27] he won't let you
[1:45:29] have too many excuses he'll have an
[1:45:31] answer for every excuse
[1:45:34] so don't think you're going to get out
[1:45:36] of it
[1:45:37] you're just going to look sillier
[1:45:39] the whole time
[1:45:42] but god's not going to let you get away
[1:45:44] from his intended purpose
[1:45:48] okay
[1:45:49] now
[1:46:00] just another quick example of what god
[1:46:02] can do with nothing
[1:46:04] is
[1:46:06] we all know the story of the the
[1:46:09] five lows and
[1:46:10] five loaves and two fish
[1:46:15] and
[1:46:18] the little boy
[1:46:20] that provided those loaves and those two
[1:46:22] fish
[1:46:24] had more trust and faith
[1:46:26] in what jesus could do
[1:46:29] than the whole rest of the crowd
[1:46:31] including all his disciples
[1:46:35] if you don't believe me go read john
[1:46:37] chapter 6.
[1:46:40] and you say how do you know that it
[1:46:42] doesn't say the little boy had faith
[1:46:44] when jesus said
[1:46:46] we need to feed all these people
[1:46:48] who has something that we can give them
[1:46:51] little boy said
[1:46:52] i have five loaves and two fish
[1:46:57] many of us
[1:46:58] when god says i have a great work to do
[1:47:02] we go okay what do i have
[1:47:05] um
[1:47:07] i have five loaves and two fish
[1:47:10] how far will that go well that was only
[1:47:11] supposed to be my lunch i'm a small boy
[1:47:14] that won't even hardly feed me because i
[1:47:16] had to walk out here
[1:47:18] so
[1:47:19] i'm not even gonna tell anyone because
[1:47:21] i'm so embarrassed i didn't bring enough
[1:47:22] for everybody
[1:47:26] that's not what jesus asked
[1:47:32] he said what do we have
[1:47:34] what do we have he didn't say how much
[1:47:36] do you have
[1:47:38] he said what do you have
[1:47:42] what do you have
[1:47:44] now jesus actually already knew
[1:47:47] that that little boy
[1:47:49] had five loaves and five fish and he
[1:47:51] knew how he was going to provide you
[1:47:53] know how i know that because that's
[1:47:54] actually written here
[1:47:56] let me read it just real quick
[1:47:58] okay
[1:47:59] john 6 verse 5
[1:48:01] and when jesus then lifted up his eyes
[1:48:03] and saw a great company come unto him he
[1:48:05] said unto philip right he turned to the
[1:48:08] disciple
[1:48:09] whence shall we buy bread
[1:48:11] that these may eat
[1:48:12] that's what jesus said to philip he
[1:48:14] asked him a question he asked philip
[1:48:15] that question
[1:48:17] and this he said to prove him for he
[1:48:20] himself knew
[1:48:22] what he would do
[1:48:25] [Laughter]
[1:48:29] we we think that when god presents a
[1:48:32] question to us we do the same thing adam
[1:48:35] did
[1:48:35] way back in the beginning
[1:48:38] when god comes through the garden
[1:48:40] calling adam adam where art thou
[1:48:44] god did not
[1:48:45] was
[1:48:47] adam wasn't hiding so well god didn't
[1:48:49] know where he was
[1:48:53] he was saying adam
[1:48:55] what did you do
[1:48:57] and can you see where you have fallen to
[1:49:01] where are you
[1:49:04] do you even know where you are adam
[1:49:07] i don't i'm not asking for myself i'm
[1:49:09] saying adam
[1:49:10] can you see what you just did
[1:49:12] can you do you realize
[1:49:15] where this has landed you
[1:49:17] where art thou
[1:49:19] with this one
[1:49:21] when shall we buy
[1:49:23] bread
[1:49:24] that these may eat
[1:49:27] and philip's like
[1:49:28] wow lord if you don't know i mean i
[1:49:29] don't know i mean how are we going to
[1:49:31] feed all these people and like the
[1:49:32] logistics and and uh that we're out here
[1:49:35] in the middle of nowhere in the desert
[1:49:36] there's no town close by by the time we
[1:49:38] go get it and come back it'll be too
[1:49:40] late
[1:49:40] and philip's going through all this all
[1:49:42] he all he wanted from philip was to go
[1:49:45] well lord you can provide
[1:49:49] i've seen you provide before can't are
[1:49:51] are you not able to provide again
[1:49:55] that was the response jesus was looking
[1:49:57] for
[1:49:58] he was testing his faith
[1:50:02] little at a time that's how he does with
[1:50:03] all of us throughout our walk he tests
[1:50:05] our faith
[1:50:06] and and we'll think and he'll be like so
[1:50:09] now you're out of a job what are you
[1:50:11] going to do now
[1:50:13] and we're like wow lord i mean if you
[1:50:15] don't know what job i'm going to get
[1:50:16] next what am i supposed to know and how
[1:50:18] am i going to provide for my family and
[1:50:20] he's like come on buddy you're failing
[1:50:23] again
[1:50:24] we're gonna have to do this lesson more
[1:50:26] than once
[1:50:28] and it's to everything in life
[1:50:30] everything we do
[1:50:32] there's not one thing that we get
[1:50:34] worried about and and you'll think and
[1:50:36] you'll and he'll go like so what
[1:50:39] how are we going to do this
[1:50:42] he's not looking for you to come up with
[1:50:44] a plan
[1:50:46] he's looking for you to say lord
[1:50:48] i don't know
[1:50:50] how we're going to do this
[1:50:52] but i'm trusting in you to bring me
[1:50:54] through anyways
[1:50:56] you see because the whole the whole walk
[1:50:59] with god is him building your faith
[1:51:03] because until you build your face to a
[1:51:05] complete trust
[1:51:07] until you completely trust him he cannot
[1:51:09] completely trust you
[1:51:11] and tell and if he can't completely
[1:51:13] trust you he can't bring you to the
[1:51:15] place he's wanting to bring you which is
[1:51:16] a place of adoption of sons and
[1:51:19] daughters with god where he then grants
[1:51:21] you full authority with him
[1:51:25] you see
[1:51:26] because if you completely trust him
[1:51:28] he can then completely trust you
[1:51:30] knowing that you'll always act in
[1:51:32] accordance with the word
[1:51:36] but as long as you're trying to add
[1:51:38] something of yourself or add something
[1:51:40] of your own ability
[1:51:42] you don't completely trust him
[1:51:44] okay
[1:51:46] five loaves and five fish but many of us
[1:51:51] afterwards
[1:51:53] make a big deal out of it
[1:51:56] we look back to what god just did and
[1:51:57] we're like wow that's amazing that's
[1:52:00] great now i can trust you he's like
[1:52:02] that's not trust
[1:52:05] 20 the the hindsight is 20 20 thing
[1:52:08] doesn't help you any
[1:52:10] because that means the next thing you
[1:52:11] come to your next time you're hungry
[1:52:12] you'll be like man
[1:52:14] i don't have anything to eat i'm just
[1:52:16] gonna starve
[1:52:19] because you still don't trust
[1:52:21] you still don't trust
[1:52:24] you still don't have faith
[1:52:27] complete
[1:52:28] trust
[1:52:32] so you just walked away
[1:52:35] and and this is what the men of this
[1:52:37] group of these thousands of men
[1:52:40] in this group that just got fed by five
[1:52:42] loaves of barley and two fishes
[1:52:47] and it says
[1:52:48] therefore they gathered them together
[1:52:50] and filled 12 baskets
[1:52:52] with the fragments of the five barley
[1:52:54] lows which remained over
[1:52:56] and above unto them that had eaten
[1:52:59] and do you know how many people were fed
[1:53:04] let me just make sure i get the right
[1:53:06] number for you here
[1:53:09] and maybe i don't have that that may
[1:53:12] have been on the verse or before there
[1:53:14] but i believe is about 2 000 men
[1:53:18] or 5 000 there we go 5 000 men
[1:53:22] besides women and children
[1:53:25] and typically back then the family unit
[1:53:27] was much larger than here in the western
[1:53:29] world
[1:53:32] the family unit was the husband
[1:53:35] a wife
[1:53:36] and anywhere from one to twenty kids
[1:53:41] like the good old farming communities
[1:53:44] so 5 000 men let's assume that only half
[1:53:48] their family came
[1:53:54] and times that by
[1:53:55] two or three
[1:53:58] but steve i know those numbers don't
[1:54:00] really add up but
[1:54:01] it's only for the story
[1:54:04] um
[1:54:05] but let's say there was 15 000 people
[1:54:08] there
[1:54:11] they all got fed
[1:54:13] they all got fed
[1:54:15] and they picked up extra they had more
[1:54:17] in the end than they did in the
[1:54:19] beginning
[1:54:20] because one
[1:54:22] one young boy
[1:54:24] had faith
[1:54:26] not the whole crowd
[1:54:28] you see faith is a powerful thing
[1:54:30] brother adam said you get one individual
[1:54:32] fully surrendered to god
[1:54:35] he can do more with that one person
[1:54:38] than 5 000
[1:54:41] look up the number because that number i
[1:54:42] know is off but it's a big number
[1:54:45] one person fully surrendered
[1:54:48] with complete total faith complete trust
[1:54:53] can have an influence
[1:54:55] over the entire community
[1:54:58] this young boy
[1:55:00] this young boy's faith
[1:55:02] fed those 5 000 men
[1:55:06] and their families
[1:55:09] one individual
[1:55:12] had faith in what god could do
[1:55:16] and working off of that faith alone
[1:55:18] god did something miraculous for
[1:55:20] everyone
[1:55:22] see that's the way a gift of god works
[1:55:25] is a gift of god
[1:55:27] isn't for you
[1:55:29] because that little boy already had his
[1:55:31] lunch
[1:55:34] you see they say in in in the financial
[1:55:36] world
[1:55:37] that those who are poor
[1:55:40] develop a hoarding
[1:55:42] mentality because they believe there
[1:55:44] won't be any any more if they let go of
[1:55:46] what they have
[1:55:47] but those who are truly truly have
[1:55:50] wealth
[1:55:51] know that the more that they give away
[1:55:54] the more they will attain
[1:55:56] because not because of their own ability
[1:55:58] or their thoughts or anything like that
[1:56:00] but it is actually a concept of
[1:56:02] scripture
[1:56:06] of god wants to take that of which
[1:56:08] you've been blessed by
[1:56:10] and share it with others
[1:56:11] because when god is doing is he is
[1:56:14] investing in you
[1:56:18] so that you're a place he can draw from
[1:56:20] to bless other people
[1:56:22] and that's not just a finance thing
[1:56:25] that is love joy peace longsuffering the
[1:56:29] gifts and of the spirit
[1:56:32] it's it's the fruits of the spirit that
[1:56:34] he's wanting to take and share with
[1:56:37] everyone else
[1:56:38] but until you have complete and total
[1:56:40] trust
[1:56:41] and faith
[1:56:43] anytime you get a little bit you no it's
[1:56:45] mine
[1:56:47] i can't i don't have enough to share
[1:56:49] with everyone else
[1:56:51] and god's saying just give it to me give
[1:56:53] it back to me and i'll multiply it for
[1:56:55] you
[1:56:57] but we're so i only got a little bit of
[1:56:59] love and this is the only love i've had
[1:57:01] my whole life
[1:57:02] and and if i give it away then what will
[1:57:04] i have i'll just be nothing
[1:57:07] great that's what god wants
[1:57:11] because until you're nothing he can't
[1:57:13] give you any any more
[1:57:15] that little bit of joy if i share my joy
[1:57:17] and if i get too excited in the service
[1:57:19] and expand myself
[1:57:20] i won't have joy for the rest of my week
[1:57:24] no he's wanting you to express joy
[1:57:27] he's wanting you to express joy
[1:57:29] in the service he's wanting you to
[1:57:31] worship and praise
[1:57:33] why because that will bubble over to the
[1:57:34] next person and the next person and the
[1:57:36] person behind you and guess what you
[1:57:39] will all walk out with more joy than
[1:57:42] what you came in with
[1:57:44] and enough to keep you through the
[1:57:45] entire week
[1:57:46] not just you but everyone else
[1:57:49] because he's just waiting you for you to
[1:57:51] give it to him and have faith complete
[1:57:53] trust
[1:57:54] i can't expend this it comes from a
[1:57:57] unexpendable fountain
[1:58:00] it is a fountain filled with blood
[1:58:03] with with no end in sight it is an ocean
[1:58:06] so great
[1:58:09] that if i take a little bit
[1:58:10] and i share it with someone i can go
[1:58:12] back to the ocean and get more
[1:58:14] there's no end to it
[1:58:17] what god can do with nothing just
[1:58:20] realize you had nothing to begin with so
[1:58:22] you have nothing to lose
[1:58:24] that's our biggest problem we think we
[1:58:26] have something to lose
[1:58:34] brother branham in a quote just just
[1:58:36] tying up that that little story said uh
[1:58:39] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:58:40] saints the little boy one day had five
[1:58:42] fishes in his hand it wasn't very much
[1:58:44] but when it come in jesus hands it fed
[1:58:46] five thousand it's not very much in your
[1:58:49] hand what you got but give it to him one
[1:58:52] time what little talent you got give it
[1:58:55] to him find out what it'll become in his
[1:58:58] hand
[1:58:59] you know and that's the exact same thing
[1:59:01] complete and total trust complete and
[1:59:03] total faith that's what that widow woman
[1:59:05] who came to the temple with her two
[1:59:06] mites
[1:59:10] jesus in speaking to his disciples said
[1:59:13] she gave more than any of the others
[1:59:16] because she gave all of that which she
[1:59:18] had
[1:59:20] now it's not that god's looking to keep
[1:59:21] us all poor
[1:59:24] but he's wanting you to be willing
[1:59:27] it's your willingness
[1:59:31] to go back to nothing
[1:59:34] without even thinking about it when god
[1:59:36] puts it on your heart
[1:59:38] and he moves on you and says give all
[1:59:40] you have
[1:59:41] give all of yourself expend yourself
[1:59:45] fully maybe that's your time
[1:59:48] maybe that is your finances maybe that's
[1:59:51] your love
[1:59:52] expend yourself of the love which you
[1:59:54] have
[1:59:55] said watch what i'll do
[1:59:59] he said lord but they're unlovable he
[2:00:01] goes yeah so where are you
[2:00:05] but fully expend yourself of that which
[2:00:08] you have
[2:00:09] and you know she had just got that she
[2:00:11] hadn't been saving it for a rainy day
[2:00:13] if you read the scripture through the
[2:00:14] gospels and follow the story
[2:00:17] she had just earned that
[2:00:19] as wages and it was meant to feed her
[2:00:22] and her son
[2:00:24] her and her children
[2:00:26] and something moved on her because jesus
[2:00:29] needed that example before his disciples
[2:00:33] do you think it just she just did it
[2:00:34] because she wanted to
[2:00:36] god was moving on her when she earned it
[2:00:39] knowing that jesus and his disciples
[2:00:41] would be standing in the temple
[2:00:43] watching people give offerings
[2:00:48] and it was an example jesus needed to
[2:00:50] show his disciples to teach them
[2:00:52] something
[2:00:53] and so god put it on her heart to go
[2:00:56] give those two mites she had just earned
[2:00:59] that day to feed her family that's all
[2:01:01] she had
[2:01:05] and she walked and she said and she was
[2:01:07] probably thinking i don't even know why
[2:01:08] i'm doing this
[2:01:11] two mites
[2:01:12] and she walked out and she said and
[2:01:14] she's probably thinking
[2:01:15] well now what do i do
[2:01:17] and jesus standing there said look at
[2:01:18] disciples come here come here come here
[2:01:20] did you see that
[2:01:22] we stood here all day we stood here the
[2:01:25] last two hours just to see this
[2:01:29] this is how important this is
[2:01:31] it's not just a story
[2:01:35] she gave all
[2:01:37] because she had complete
[2:01:39] and total trust she had faith that god
[2:01:42] would provide her needs if she gave back
[2:01:45] to him
[2:01:47] and because of that she gave more than
[2:01:49] anyone else
[2:01:52] and i'll bless her for that
[2:01:54] i don't believe for a second then her
[2:01:56] and her children went hungry that night
[2:01:59] not for a moment
[2:02:02] but that's the mentality we find
[2:02:04] ourselves in so many times
[2:02:07] we're so afraid
[2:02:09] if i give up what i have
[2:02:11] there won't be enough for me
[2:02:14] now don't mistake me i know this is used
[2:02:16] in many a church and many places and and
[2:02:19] poor men in ministries that are teaching
[2:02:20] things wrong and it's because they're
[2:02:22] facing the people
[2:02:24] i didn't say give it to the church
[2:02:28] it may take that form
[2:02:30] i said give it to
[2:02:31] give it to god
[2:02:35] maybe you took that two mites and you
[2:02:36] gave it to someone on the side of the
[2:02:38] road i don't know maybe you found
[2:02:40] someone in need and you bought them some
[2:02:42] some fruits and vegetables maybe someone
[2:02:44] you met them and they were
[2:02:46] breaking down and you spent some time
[2:02:48] with them
[2:02:49] and you walked them off a ledge and you
[2:02:51] prayed with them
[2:02:52] and you gave of your time
[2:02:55] you gave of the two mites of your time
[2:02:57] that you didn't have
[2:03:00] you took that extra moment to share
[2:03:02] god's love
[2:03:04] when you yourself were at a point when
[2:03:07] you're like lord
[2:03:08] you woke up that morning you said i
[2:03:10] don't even feel saved this morning
[2:03:12] lord where are you
[2:03:14] i need you more today than ever before
[2:03:17] and you know what he does he takes you
[2:03:19] into the path of someone who needs
[2:03:22] something
[2:03:23] he said out of the what you feeling you
[2:03:26] have nothing are you willing to give the
[2:03:28] little you have
[2:03:29] because maybe he's just waiting for you
[2:03:31] to do that so he can bless you
[2:03:32] abundantly because so many times i've
[2:03:35] felt
[2:03:36] that maybe i've been struggling
[2:03:40] and you'll come in contact with someone
[2:03:42] who's looking to withdraw from you
[2:03:45] and you have a choice to make
[2:03:47] you can either be like
[2:03:49] i ain't got nothing to give you
[2:03:51] i barely have enough to keep myself
[2:03:53] right now
[2:03:54] i'm i'm hurting right now
[2:03:56] can't you see that
[2:04:00] i barely have enough love to keep me
[2:04:02] going
[2:04:03] the joy of my salvation i'm barely
[2:04:05] holding on
[2:04:09] you want to share your problems with me
[2:04:13] go find someone who cares
[2:04:17] i ain't got time
[2:04:19] i barely have time to do what i'm doing
[2:04:22] i'm barely getting sleep at night
[2:04:25] and god's giving you an opportunity to
[2:04:28] do something with nothing
[2:04:32] he's looking for you to say lord i have
[2:04:34] nothing to give them
[2:04:35] come and use me speak through me to them
[2:04:38] bless them in some way
[2:04:40] and when you become that conduit
[2:04:43] for god to speak for god to share his
[2:04:46] love
[2:04:47] you know what he has to do first he's
[2:04:49] got to pour it through you
[2:04:51] he's got to fill you up in that moment
[2:04:53] so that it's pouring over so that your
[2:04:56] cup is running over
[2:04:58] so that it spills over to them
[2:05:02] and you'll walk away from that moment
[2:05:05] so spoken to
[2:05:07] so blessed
[2:05:09] you won't believe it
[2:05:11] but as long as you're holding on
[2:05:13] yourself
[2:05:14] this is mine i gotta keep it i don't
[2:05:16] know what am i gonna do next
[2:05:19] you'll never experience that never
[2:05:22] um
[2:05:27] and i gotta let you guys go
[2:05:30] it's okay
[2:05:34] god is so good
[2:05:36] god is so good he's so merciful so kind
[2:05:39] he's
[2:05:40] so long-suffering so
[2:05:43] so wonderful
[2:05:47] let me just read this to you
[2:05:50] see here
[2:05:55] let me just
[2:06:12] um
[2:06:16] we're going to make it through through
[2:06:18] this this uh set of note saints we've
[2:06:21] only made page 10 out of 10 i mean 2 out
[2:06:24] of 10 so
[2:06:26] but i want to
[2:06:28] i know the lord says what he wants to
[2:06:30] say
[2:06:32] whether or not
[2:06:33] we use our notes
[2:06:37] it's not about that i i think most of
[2:06:40] the time
[2:06:41] god just wants to see are you willing to
[2:06:43] put in the work
[2:06:45] to be a blessing to others
[2:06:47] and then when it comes time to be a
[2:06:48] blessing he just does what he wants to
[2:06:50] do
[2:06:52] don't be so invested in your own work
[2:06:55] your own notes your own ideas that you
[2:06:58] can't just let god bless someone the way
[2:07:00] he wants to bless them
[2:07:02] that's that's where we struggle so much
[2:07:05] is that we're like no no i did this i
[2:07:08] did this so i got to use it i got to do
[2:07:11] something with this god's like no no no
[2:07:13] that was just me saying if you were
[2:07:14] willing to you were willing to actually
[2:07:17] put time aside that's just me saying if
[2:07:19] you were
[2:07:20] willing to take isaac and put him on the
[2:07:22] altar
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:24] this was me trying to get you to realize
[2:07:26] what are you willing to sacrifice
[2:07:28] are you willing to sacrifice oh good
[2:07:31] wonderful we're on the right track we
[2:07:33] got you to nothing
[2:07:34] you're willing to give up everything to
[2:07:36] be a blessing to somebody
[2:07:38] all right but now i'm going to do it my
[2:07:40] way so just get out of the way
[2:07:43] and and that's just what we got to
[2:07:44] realize saying so many times
[2:07:47] is that's what he's just waiting for us
[2:07:49] to do
[2:07:50] he wants us to see ourselves for
[2:07:52] ourselves are you willing to to give up
[2:07:54] are you willing to dedicate yourself a
[2:07:56] little are you willing to suffer a
[2:07:58] little are you willing to go through he
[2:08:00] said you know they're going to scourge
[2:08:01] you
[2:08:02] when you go out
[2:08:03] with nothing
[2:08:05] are you willing to take the scourges
[2:08:07] for my sake
[2:08:09] and maybe it's not a physical scourge
[2:08:10] anymore but maybe it's something that
[2:08:12] requires you to make a sacrifice
[2:08:15] of your of your ability of your time or
[2:08:17] whatever it is
[2:08:19] he says okay you made the sacrifice
[2:08:22] now i'm gonna
[2:08:24] bless you and them
[2:08:26] because guess what
[2:08:28] when he comes and he does it his own way
[2:08:31] the person speaking gets this the person
[2:08:33] whose voice he's using
[2:08:35] just just as much blessing as those who
[2:08:37] are listening because i we we're hearing
[2:08:39] it for the first time too
[2:08:42] when it's not your thoughts it's just
[2:08:44] your voice
[2:08:46] saints and it doesn't make anyone
[2:08:48] special
[2:08:50] the fact that god can use you doesn't
[2:08:51] make you special it means you just
[2:08:53] finally got yourself out of the way
[2:08:56] he can do it with any of you
[2:08:59] no matter your age no matter your your
[2:09:01] standing no longer matter how long
[2:09:03] you've been in the message no longer how
[2:09:05] long you've been a christian no matter
[2:09:07] where you're at in life
[2:09:10] if even in one moment you say lord
[2:09:13] just use me
[2:09:14] you're at school and something comes up
[2:09:17] you're at work something comes up you're
[2:09:19] driving in your car something comes up
[2:09:23] you just go lord use me
[2:09:26] that's simple
[2:09:28] and if you really mean it
[2:09:30] if you have complete trust what i mean
[2:09:32] by complete trust
[2:09:34] in those situations is lord i am not
[2:09:37] afraid
[2:09:39] of anything that might come out my mouth
[2:09:42] once you start using it
[2:09:44] because you know that's the reason why
[2:09:45] most of us don't surrender in those
[2:09:47] situations
[2:09:48] we're scared
[2:09:50] god might use our voice to say something
[2:09:53] that we would never say ourselves in
[2:09:55] public or to somebody
[2:09:58] and it might embarrass us
[2:10:03] we're scared we might be embarrassed
[2:10:08] by what god is using us to do
[2:10:11] and so we don't want to fully
[2:10:13] trust
[2:10:14] we just want to have a little trust
[2:10:17] but we want to have some type of
[2:10:19] gatekeeping ability on the voice
[2:10:24] and every time you do that it will fall
[2:10:26] flat
[2:10:29] you'll say a lot of flowery words but
[2:10:31] there'll be no connection
[2:10:34] but when you let go
[2:10:36] your words may not be the most eloquent
[2:10:38] but there'll be such a presence drop in
[2:10:41] that place
[2:10:42] and you and that individual or you and
[2:10:44] whoever it is that you're helping you're
[2:10:46] speaking to whatever way you're doing it
[2:10:48] that god's using you it'll be like it's
[2:10:50] you and them alone in the room it
[2:10:52] doesn't matter if it is you and them or
[2:10:54] if it's you and a hundred people it
[2:10:56] doesn't matter if you're standing on the
[2:10:57] side of the sidewalk
[2:10:59] and the cars are driving by there could
[2:11:02] be a mob going down the road and you and
[2:11:04] that individual stand there you're in a
[2:11:06] bubble and a world all your own
[2:11:11] and god will use you
[2:11:13] when you realize lord i have nothing to
[2:11:15] add to this i'm depleted myself
[2:11:19] just come and use me to speak to your
[2:11:21] people
[2:11:22] here
[2:11:24] yeah
[2:11:26] that's
[2:11:27] okay
[2:11:29] let's go to
[2:11:33] mary's belief it's going to read this i
[2:11:36] got two quotes for you and then we're
[2:11:37] gonna end the service
[2:11:40] um mary's belief and i'm gonna skip
[2:11:42] through this a little bit
[2:11:44] uh mary she didn't wait until she was
[2:11:46] positive
[2:11:47] she didn't wait to see some physical
[2:11:49] sign
[2:11:50] if i look for a physical sign for what
[2:11:52] i'm led for tonight i'll look for every
[2:11:54] seat in here to be taken up
[2:11:56] that's brother branham speaking about
[2:11:58] the place where he was at when the place
[2:12:00] is only about two-thirds full but that
[2:12:02] doesn't matter
[2:12:03] we don't have to have an overflowing
[2:12:05] crowd
[2:12:06] there was 120 in the upper room but they
[2:12:08] were all in the hands of god god started
[2:12:11] a revival with them 120 completely
[2:12:15] surrendered
[2:12:16] completely trusting
[2:12:19] into his hands that that's never ended a
[2:12:23] fire that cannot be put out
[2:12:25] what could god do here tonight with
[2:12:27] these hundreds in his hands what god do
[2:12:31] with us here today if we would just lend
[2:12:33] ourselves and put ourselves in his hands
[2:12:36] it's just getting ready believing
[2:12:38] holding his promise before him
[2:12:41] you see it's not holding our ability
[2:12:42] it's holding his promise
[2:12:45] before him
[2:12:46] mary could have waited till she had some
[2:12:48] kind of sign that she was going to be a
[2:12:50] mother
[2:12:51] and you could wait
[2:12:52] after the meeting i'm sure many of all
[2:12:54] the mothers in here today
[2:12:57] could identify with this statement
[2:13:00] is many of you knew before anyone else i
[2:13:03] think i'm a mother
[2:13:05] i'm pretty sure
[2:13:06] but i'm not going to tell anyone until
[2:13:08] i'm really sure
[2:13:11] right
[2:13:12] but he says mary could have waited she
[2:13:14] could have done that same thing it's a
[2:13:16] natural thing to do
[2:13:18] until she had some kind of sign that she
[2:13:20] was going to be a mother and you could
[2:13:22] wait after the meetings over
[2:13:24] until you feel that you could move your
[2:13:26] crippled leg just a little better
[2:13:28] or you could hear a little better out of
[2:13:30] that deaf ear or the cancer seemed to be
[2:13:32] that it wasn't bothering you so much
[2:13:35] that's not taking god at his word take
[2:13:37] god at his word is to hear his word and
[2:13:40] accept it and start rejoicing with it
[2:13:43] we could see
[2:13:45] i'm just gonna
[2:13:46] skip down we just have to take god's
[2:13:49] word for it and start rejoicing
[2:13:51] something will happen that brings the
[2:13:52] word of of word to life as we water it
[2:13:56] with praises what makes a seed grow
[2:13:59] water what makes the word of god grow is
[2:14:02] the praises of god
[2:14:04] i'm continuing just to jump down to
[2:14:06] paragraph 21 you're wanting a revival
[2:14:09] start watering the word the promise that
[2:14:12] makes me feel religious myself now
[2:14:15] the minute don't don't get caught up on
[2:14:17] it you start watering the word
[2:14:19] on the you part
[2:14:21] because remember the watering is being
[2:14:24] done through praise
[2:14:26] and you wouldn't be able to praise him
[2:14:28] unless he gave it to you to praise him
[2:14:30] with
[2:14:31] and you're what watering the word his
[2:14:34] word not yours
[2:14:37] so
[2:14:37] you have to have full
[2:14:39] trust full complete faith in his word
[2:14:43] that if you will water it with that
[2:14:45] which he's given you it'll grow and take
[2:14:47] root
[2:14:49] um
[2:14:51] if you want to come out of that that
[2:14:53] makes me feel religious myself if you
[2:14:55] want to come out of the wheelchair start
[2:14:57] wandering the word if you want to come
[2:14:58] from that cancer start watering the word
[2:15:00] little ricky tonight here is a testimony
[2:15:02] that god heals cancer he heals cancer he
[2:15:05] heals all our sickness thousands times
[2:15:07] thousands of infallible proofs of it
[2:15:09] we've seen
[2:15:11] mary started quickly testifying that she
[2:15:13] was going to have this baby how she
[2:15:15] going to have it she never knowed a man
[2:15:18] there's never been such as that has ever
[2:15:20] happened
[2:15:21] now remember this real quick
[2:15:24] this had never happened to us it is a 2
[2:15:27] 000 year old story that we because we
[2:15:30] say we believe in jesus christ and our
[2:15:32] christians just take for granted
[2:15:37] no
[2:15:38] time
[2:15:40] in the in the thousands of years prior
[2:15:43] to starting from creation to mary
[2:15:46] had this ever happened
[2:15:50] god had never done this
[2:15:52] there was no example in scripture of god
[2:15:56] doing this with anyone nothing even
[2:15:58] close
[2:16:01] even with abraham and sarah
[2:16:04] they were still husband and wife
[2:16:07] they just were younger
[2:16:12] this was a whole new thing god was doing
[2:16:17] you have to be so
[2:16:19] sold out
[2:16:21] that you believe god's word is true when
[2:16:24] he's doing things like this
[2:16:27] because you're going to look really
[2:16:30] crazy
[2:16:33] there's never been such as that has ever
[2:16:34] happened but she just took the word of
[2:16:36] the lord at what it meant and begin to
[2:16:38] rejoice if each person here tonight
[2:16:40] that's bound with sin in your lives will
[2:16:42] just take him at his word
[2:16:45] and start rejoicing
[2:16:47] because jesus saith he that cometh to me
[2:16:50] i will in no wise cast out though your
[2:16:53] sins be a scarlet they shall be white as
[2:16:56] wool there is no need of being bound
[2:16:58] down you can be free tonight from your
[2:17:01] burden of sin if there are those here to
[2:17:03] unite are bound by sickness just take
[2:17:05] him at his word and start rejoicing you
[2:17:08] can be free he said so
[2:17:10] and he's no respect of person whoever
[2:17:13] will let him come
[2:17:16] now
[2:17:17] there when he said you are bound by sin
[2:17:20] i know same thing we touch on this a
[2:17:22] little bit just briefly earlier about
[2:17:24] how that feeling of condemnation keeps
[2:17:26] you back the devil tells you you're not
[2:17:28] good enough to be there i had some other
[2:17:30] examples in here there was that harlot
[2:17:33] that came before jesus he was there at
[2:17:35] the pharisees house
[2:17:37] and she came running in
[2:17:39] and fell at his feet began washing his
[2:17:42] feet with her tears and drying it with
[2:17:44] his her hair
[2:17:46] and anointing his feet with oil
[2:17:52] it was because she knew she had nothing
[2:17:55] to offer
[2:17:57] that she ran to the feet of jesus
[2:18:01] she didn't walk up and present gifts
[2:18:04] she ran to his feet
[2:18:06] and the only way she knew to ask for
[2:18:10] forgiveness
[2:18:12] was by
[2:18:13] weeping
[2:18:15] and
[2:18:16] she didn't come in thinking i'll wash
[2:18:17] his feet
[2:18:19] that wasn't her thing she fouled her at
[2:18:22] his feet a sinner
[2:18:24] saying if anyone can make me whole of
[2:18:27] sin
[2:18:28] you can
[2:18:30] and she was so moved in his presence
[2:18:35] that the tears began to stream it wasn't
[2:18:38] she did it wasn't a worked up thing
[2:18:41] she didn't get in there and work up her
[2:18:42] tears so she could wash his feet
[2:18:46] but she was so moved upon in her spirit
[2:18:51] that the tears began to flow
[2:18:53] and they washed his feet
[2:18:55] and as she got the tears on his feet she
[2:18:58] realized my tears aren't worthy to be on
[2:19:00] his feet but the only thing she had was
[2:19:02] her hair to dry them
[2:19:06] she anointed his feet with an oil
[2:19:09] he said what do i what can i offer she
[2:19:12] didn't do it from her abundance per se
[2:19:14] but it's just all she had she said lord
[2:19:16] you have everything i have whatever you
[2:19:18] want to do with it you do
[2:19:21] because you know that
[2:19:22] that very expensive
[2:19:25] oil
[2:19:27] was purchased with the money she had
[2:19:28] earned
[2:19:32] through her profession
[2:19:36] how many people today
[2:19:38] if they saw that happen would say
[2:19:40] how dare you
[2:19:42] anoint the lord's feet
[2:19:44] with something bought in such a manner
[2:19:49] but jesus knew her heart
[2:19:51] it was her only way
[2:19:53] she brought everything she had and laid
[2:19:55] it at his feet and said lord do with it
[2:19:58] with that which you will
[2:20:02] and he said
[2:20:03] your sins which were many
[2:20:06] are all
[2:20:07] forgiven
[2:20:11] so don't let where you're at or where
[2:20:14] you've been
[2:20:15] keep you from the master's feet
[2:20:18] so if you can come
[2:20:20] recognizing yourself as nothing before
[2:20:22] his feet
[2:20:24] he'll raise you up
[2:20:26] and he can do something mighty now
[2:20:29] he can use you for his purpose and for
[2:20:31] service
[2:20:32] because even right in that night
[2:20:34] he used that woman
[2:20:37] and her actions
[2:20:39] to speak to
[2:20:41] and condemn the pharisee
[2:20:44] right at the same time
[2:20:49] because the pharisees sat there judging
[2:20:50] him
[2:20:52] you know many people think the pharisee
[2:20:53] was judging the woman
[2:20:55] pharisee had already judged a woman long
[2:20:57] ago he saw her in the street all the
[2:20:59] time
[2:21:00] he was judging christ
[2:21:04] right because he said if
[2:21:06] in his thoughts he didn't say it out
[2:21:09] loud he thought he was being proper and
[2:21:10] polite and and all that stuff because
[2:21:13] that was his training
[2:21:15] but in his thoughts he was thinking
[2:21:18] if you if he was a prophet
[2:21:21] you see he had no faith in jesus as a
[2:21:24] prophet
[2:21:27] he invited him in in acted like he was
[2:21:30] doing it
[2:21:31] something good
[2:21:32] but he was doing it to bring him in
[2:21:34] close to see if i can catch him maybe in
[2:21:36] a time of intimate time of conversation
[2:21:39] i'll catch him
[2:21:40] and prove he's not a prophet
[2:21:44] then i can just
[2:21:46] show the rest of the people too what he
[2:21:48] the the false prophet that they're
[2:21:50] following
[2:21:52] and so he's sitting there and he's
[2:21:53] thinking aha
[2:21:54] i knew it all the time
[2:21:56] it was too good to be true
[2:21:58] because if he was a prophet
[2:22:01] he would know
[2:22:02] what manner of woman
[2:22:05] she
[2:22:06] is and jesus didn't say anything right
[2:22:09] away
[2:22:10] he was focused in on the woman
[2:22:12] the pharisee didn't matter
[2:22:14] he got all the way through with the
[2:22:16] woman first
[2:22:20] and then he said to simon simon
[2:22:24] i know what you've been thinking
[2:22:27] how does that put me on the scale on
[2:22:29] whether or not i'm a prophet
[2:22:32] i know your thoughts
[2:22:34] and i can tell you this
[2:22:37] since the time she entered the room
[2:22:40] she's not ceased to wash my feet with
[2:22:42] her tears
[2:22:44] and dry them with her hair
[2:22:46] and anoint my feet with oil and kiss my
[2:22:50] feet
[2:22:52] simon
[2:22:53] you did not even follow the proper
[2:22:55] customs
[2:22:56] of the land
[2:22:58] that as a guest when i came in someone
[2:23:00] should have washed my feet if not you
[2:23:02] someone of your household
[2:23:04] when i came in
[2:23:06] you should have
[2:23:07] anointed me with oil
[2:23:10] when i came in you should have welcomed
[2:23:12] me with a kiss
[2:23:15] and here you sit judging this woman
[2:23:19] when you
[2:23:20] even according to your own customs
[2:23:23] did not fulfill them correctly
[2:23:26] now simon tell me
[2:23:31] who loveth more
[2:23:33] one who is forgiven much
[2:23:36] or one who is forgiven little
[2:23:40] this is an easy one buddy
[2:23:42] you know i don't you don't even need
[2:23:43] your fair
[2:23:45] they're training as a pharisee for this
[2:23:46] one
[2:23:49] he said well obviously he that is
[2:23:50] forgiven more
[2:23:53] he said yes
[2:23:54] he that's forgiven more
[2:23:57] no woman
[2:23:59] thy sins which were many
[2:24:02] they are all forgiven
[2:24:04] go and sin no more
[2:24:06] because this love
[2:24:08] that you're going to be living by
[2:24:10] is the love that's going to go with you
[2:24:12] and keep you from that life of sin
[2:24:15] this is not under the law or i tell you
[2:24:17] don't now don't go sin or i'll strike
[2:24:20] you down
[2:24:21] but this is the law where i say go in
[2:24:23] sin no more
[2:24:25] because i will go with you and be with
[2:24:28] you
[2:24:29] and in you
[2:24:31] to the ends of the world
[2:24:33] you're no longer working or keeping
[2:24:35] yourself under your own power
[2:24:38] but the power that is within you will
[2:24:40] keep you
[2:24:43] one last
[2:24:45] one
[2:24:47] in israel in the church
[2:24:49] 1953
[2:24:51] brother random says
[2:24:53] we're just going to end on this little
[2:24:55] note of of faith
[2:24:58] puts me in mind of a colored man down in
[2:25:00] the south an old fellow packed his bible
[2:25:02] around said and and said why are you
[2:25:04] carrying that bible for boy
[2:25:07] he said i believe it
[2:25:09] i said you can't you can't read a word
[2:25:11] in it
[2:25:13] you see every once in a while even a
[2:25:15] prophet will play devil's advocate
[2:25:17] just to test people
[2:25:19] and see where they actually believe just
[2:25:21] like jesus telling philip philip how
[2:25:23] we're going to feed all these people
[2:25:26] sometimes he'll send someone or come
[2:25:29] your way and test you a little bit see
[2:25:31] what your response is see see what as
[2:25:33] they say see what spills out
[2:25:36] they say you are the person you you
[2:25:38] really are
[2:25:40] when when you're in the worst of
[2:25:42] situations
[2:25:45] you're not you're not the person you are
[2:25:46] in the best of the situation the real
[2:25:48] you is the real you you are in the worst
[2:25:51] of situations
[2:25:52] when your buttons are being pushed as
[2:25:54] they say
[2:25:56] you can't read a word in it
[2:25:58] said i believe it anyhow
[2:26:00] said i believe it from kever to giver
[2:26:02] believe the giver also
[2:26:04] said how you know
[2:26:07] he said it's got holy bible wrote on it
[2:26:10] and that's why
[2:26:11] i believe the cover
[2:26:14] yes sir
[2:26:15] he believed it anyhow
[2:26:18] here is a man like mary
[2:26:21] had to stand believing something he
[2:26:23] could not confirm for himself
[2:26:27] he could not read it himself
[2:26:30] he would have to have someone else read
[2:26:31] it for him and he had to have faith and
[2:26:34] complete trust
[2:26:36] that they were reading it correctly
[2:26:39] and then god was revealing it to him
[2:26:41] correctly
[2:26:43] and that god would let him know if they
[2:26:45] read it wrong
[2:26:49] how many of us
[2:26:51] even though we all can read
[2:26:53] won't believe something until we read it
[2:26:54] ourselves
[2:26:56] let's
[2:26:57] you know we'll be let's say
[2:26:58] i know with kids you'll be playing a
[2:27:00] game and this is the way it was for me
[2:27:01] growing up
[2:27:03] and we were all extremely competitive
[2:27:07] and so when you're extremely competitive
[2:27:08] you always see what you can get away
[2:27:10] with but the minute you see someone else
[2:27:11] getting away with someone thinking you
[2:27:12] pull out the rules
[2:27:15] yeah that's what we do we do that and
[2:27:17] we
[2:27:18] we do that with each other in life
[2:27:22] and
[2:27:23] they'll read the rules and they'll say
[2:27:24] the rules say this and this you'll be
[2:27:25] like no uh give me that i'm gonna read
[2:27:28] it myself
[2:27:31] that's the way most of us are in most
[2:27:33] things
[2:27:35] we're not willing to take someone else's
[2:27:37] word for it
[2:27:39] even if they your even if they're
[2:27:41] standing in front of you reading the
[2:27:42] document
[2:27:44] like let me read it myself that's what
[2:27:46] brother branham said the hardest thing
[2:27:47] god ever did
[2:27:49] was get one man to believe another
[2:27:52] and that's why it's the foolishness of
[2:27:54] preaching
[2:27:56] it doesn't make any sense naturally
[2:27:58] the natural man says you should be
[2:28:00] skeptical of everything coming out of my
[2:28:02] mouth
[2:28:04] not believe it one word
[2:28:07] now i say
[2:28:09] believe it
[2:28:10] but go and prove it
[2:28:13] and that's the difference but anyways
[2:28:15] here we go i'm i'm running off on the
[2:28:17] side
[2:28:18] he believed it anyhow didn't make any
[2:28:20] difference
[2:28:21] and said i said what would you do
[2:28:24] said you do anything is in that bible
[2:28:28] said the lord told me to do anything i'd
[2:28:31] do it
[2:28:32] he said what if he tell you jump through
[2:28:35] that wall he said i'll jump
[2:28:38] you think you could walk through that
[2:28:40] wall without a hole in it
[2:28:42] said if the lord told me to jump
[2:28:44] he'd make a hole in it for me
[2:28:47] that's right too brother hallelujah
[2:28:50] that's the truth god tells you to jump
[2:28:52] he'll have the hole there when you get
[2:28:55] there don't worry about it
[2:28:58] that's what god can do with nothing
[2:29:00] is i have no ability most of us god says
[2:29:03] jump to the wall and say well lord we
[2:29:05] need some demo tools we need a
[2:29:07] jackhammer maybe a tractor
[2:29:10] maybe a crew of men to create the hole
[2:29:12] first for me because if i make the hole
[2:29:15] i may be too tired to jump through it
[2:29:16] when i'm done
[2:29:23] god said no no no
[2:29:24] jump
[2:29:26] jump through the wall
[2:29:28] jump through the wall
[2:29:30] just do it
[2:29:32] complete just like a child if i
[2:29:36] you had a little kid that trusted you
[2:29:38] totally
[2:29:40] and you convinced them
[2:29:41] and some of us will start laughing to
[2:29:43] ourselves because we've done these
[2:29:45] things before
[2:29:47] because we we find it very funny
[2:29:50] and you you know they're not going to be
[2:29:52] able to do something and you'll convince
[2:29:54] them hey
[2:29:55] go do it you can do it you can do it and
[2:29:57] we do it because we know they're going
[2:29:58] to run they're going to hit that thing
[2:30:00] and bounce back and it's going and we're
[2:30:02] all going to laugh
[2:30:05] but they have complete and total trust
[2:30:08] it's only after you've done that to them
[2:30:10] a couple of times that they start
[2:30:12] becoming more wary
[2:30:14] and they'll walk up and they'll be like
[2:30:19] no i can't
[2:30:22] and no matter now what you do you can't
[2:30:24] convince them
[2:30:25] right
[2:30:26] and that's how many of us are in life
[2:30:28] we've tried to do things ourselves and
[2:30:30] jump through the wall and boom we've hit
[2:30:33] the wall and fallen back and so now when
[2:30:35] god says hey
[2:30:36] go jump through that wall lord i can't
[2:30:38] jump through that wall i've tried to
[2:30:39] jump through the wall and i've done this
[2:30:40] and i've done that and i didn't hit the
[2:30:42] wall and i hit my head and i fell down
[2:30:44] and i said no no that's when you tried
[2:30:46] to jump through the wall by yourself
[2:30:49] you're not jumping through the wall by
[2:30:50] yourself this time moses
[2:30:53] you're not you're not going to battle by
[2:30:55] yourself gideon
[2:30:57] you're
[2:30:58] not when i say jump through the wall
[2:31:02] just jump
[2:31:04] just jump
[2:31:06] because you don't even need a hole in
[2:31:07] the wall
[2:31:12] god doesn't need a hole in the wall to
[2:31:14] take you through
[2:31:17] because if you have total faith
[2:31:19] then you'll start moving like jesus did
[2:31:22] after the resurrection
[2:31:24] where here they are they're in a a
[2:31:27] a room a walled room
[2:31:29] and you know that the the rooms and the
[2:31:31] buildings that they built back then in
[2:31:33] those days were mud walls if you go back
[2:31:35] to the area and see some of the
[2:31:37] buildings that are still from that
[2:31:38] period
[2:31:39] or were built in the same ways they're
[2:31:41] two and three feet thick
[2:31:45] dirt mud and stones and sticks
[2:31:49] it's not like even the wall like this
[2:31:50] here today has got a little brick on the
[2:31:51] outside
[2:31:52] if all of us got angry enough and had
[2:31:54] took these chairs we might make it
[2:31:56] through
[2:32:01] yes sir yes sir
[2:32:03] but that was not the case and they had a
[2:32:05] big wooden door on the door
[2:32:07] and they would take a slab of wood to
[2:32:10] lock it in place a bar across the door
[2:32:13] you'd need a ramrod and multiple men to
[2:32:16] break that thing down
[2:32:18] and here they are they're hiding after
[2:32:20] the resurrection
[2:32:22] they're in hiding
[2:32:24] no one else even knows where they're at
[2:32:27] they've had no other contact with jesus
[2:32:28] since the resurrection
[2:32:30] to tell him this is the room we're at
[2:32:34] and all of a sudden
[2:32:35] one minute he's not there
[2:32:37] and the next minute he's just standing
[2:32:38] there in the room
[2:32:41] because he don't need holes in the wall
[2:32:44] to come on through
[2:32:45] and if you have complete and total trust
[2:32:48] he doesn't need a hole in the wall
[2:32:50] either to take you through whatever it
[2:32:51] is he's taking you through whatever that
[2:32:54] wall represents for you
[2:32:55] just trust him
[2:32:57] and say lord i believe you can take me
[2:33:00] through
[2:33:01] close your eyes and just walk into the
[2:33:03] wall and the next minute the next minute
[2:33:07] you won't even feel the wall you'll just
[2:33:09] be outside
[2:33:11] you open your eyes you'll be wandering
[2:33:12] around outside you won't even know when
[2:33:14] you went through that wall
[2:33:17] because that's how he's looking to lead
[2:33:19] you that's look at how he's looking to
[2:33:20] carry you through the the the footsteps
[2:33:23] musicians if you'll come because i'll
[2:33:24] just keep going
[2:33:27] with footsteps on the santa time that
[2:33:29] poem
[2:33:31] the man looking back over it he's
[2:33:32] talking with the lord
[2:33:35] these are all stories we've all heard
[2:33:37] over and over time they've been there
[2:33:39] over and over
[2:33:40] but it doesn't make them any less
[2:33:44] if we can touch into the revelation
[2:33:47] the inspiration that they were written
[2:33:49] in
[2:33:49] the inspiration that this word was
[2:33:51] written in the inspiration of the songs
[2:33:54] and what the inspiration they were
[2:33:56] written in
[2:33:59] oh there'll just be an abundance of
[2:34:01] power
[2:34:02] you won't be able to contain it you
[2:34:03] won't be able to hold it
[2:34:06] you won't be able to stop sharing it
[2:34:09] it'll just move and move and move
[2:34:15] god's just waiting
[2:34:18] are you willing to admit you have
[2:34:20] nothing
[2:34:21] are you willing to admit you are nothing
[2:34:24] and then are you willing to surrender
[2:34:26] are you willing to trust
[2:34:28] and as you begin to learn to trust
[2:34:31] at one point will you learn to have
[2:34:33] faith
[2:34:35] that's what jesus told them there on the
[2:34:36] boat when the the seas the
[2:34:38] the
[2:34:39] thousands of demons
[2:34:41] came and beset themselves upon the ocean
[2:34:45] they said let's drown them
[2:34:48] and it was so bad
[2:34:51] that these men
[2:34:52] who were seasoned sailors of the sea
[2:34:56] who'd been in many a storm
[2:34:58] their boat was filling with water
[2:35:03] and they began to worry and have fear
[2:35:06] and panic
[2:35:09] and in that moment they were doing
[2:35:10] everything themselves
[2:35:12] everything they knew how to do
[2:35:15] all of their own ability they were
[2:35:18] rowing they were bailing water they were
[2:35:20] doing all these things
[2:35:23] and you know what they forgot
[2:35:26] they forgot jesus was on the boat
[2:35:30] they actually thought
[2:35:32] not only did the demons think it but for
[2:35:34] a moment
[2:35:36] the disciples thought
[2:35:38] that the demons of hell
[2:35:41] might have a chance of sinking a boat
[2:35:44] that jesus was in
[2:35:48] that's doubt
[2:35:51] doubt caused them to think that
[2:35:53] fear
[2:35:54] caused them to believe it
[2:35:56] [Music]
[2:35:58] and jesus didn't move on the scene
[2:36:02] from where he was at until they called
[2:36:04] out his name
[2:36:08] that whole time they never once called
[2:36:10] out his name
[2:36:13] and it's the same thing in our lives
[2:36:16] until you reach the end of your own
[2:36:18] ability
[2:36:19] where you see yourself as nothing and
[2:36:22] call out his name
[2:36:24] and say jesus
[2:36:26] help us
[2:36:27] jesus save me
[2:36:29] [Music]
[2:36:31] deliver me from myself
[2:36:34] deliver me from this situation
[2:36:38] carry me through
[2:36:40] we were talking about those footsteps on
[2:36:42] the sounds of time that's right i keep
[2:36:44] halfway through the story i move on
[2:36:48] the man was looking back over the
[2:36:49] footsteps and he saw
[2:36:51] that during a period of time there was
[2:36:53] two sets of footprints his and the lords
[2:36:57] and
[2:36:58] he looked at the most difficult parts of
[2:37:00] his life
[2:37:01] and during the most difficult parts of
[2:37:03] his life
[2:37:04] there was only one set of footprints
[2:37:07] and he turned to the lord next to him
[2:37:08] and said lord i don't understand
[2:37:10] [Music]
[2:37:12] why is it that there's only one foot set
[2:37:14] of footprints when i was going through
[2:37:16] such a hard time why did you leave me
[2:37:22] you see he was so distraught in that
[2:37:24] time of his life
[2:37:26] he didn't he couldn't even recognize
[2:37:28] what god was doing in his life
[2:37:30] think about that how many times have we
[2:37:33] been there
[2:37:35] when we're so down
[2:37:38] life has got us so beat down we think
[2:37:40] we're doing it all on our own
[2:37:42] and no one's helping us
[2:37:45] and jesus goes to him no no no you
[2:37:47] misunderstand
[2:37:49] through those times
[2:37:51] when you only see one foot set of
[2:37:52] footprints
[2:37:53] that's when i was carrying you
[2:37:56] you didn't have the strength to do it on
[2:37:57] your own
[2:37:59] i carried you on through until you were
[2:38:01] strong enough again
[2:38:02] [Music]
[2:38:03] i only let you walk when you have the
[2:38:05] strength to do it
[2:38:06] other than that i carry you
[2:38:09] you didn't do that yourself i was with
[2:38:11] you the whole time
[2:38:13] you're just so focused on yourself you
[2:38:14] didn't see me
[2:38:17] same thing there on the boat
[2:38:20] and they finally called out said jesus
[2:38:24] care you not that we perish
[2:38:27] don't you care about me at all don't you
[2:38:29] care about our lives
[2:38:32] you're just sleeping in the back of the
[2:38:34] boat
[2:38:36] think about it that's the faith jesus
[2:38:38] wants us to come to
[2:38:41] is the same faith the faith of the son
[2:38:43] of god
[2:38:45] that when the boat of life
[2:38:48] is so rocked
[2:38:49] and going through such a storm
[2:38:52] that it looks like it's going to go
[2:38:54] under
[2:38:56] that you're just at peace
[2:38:58] you're just sleeping in the boat
[2:39:00] you can are so
[2:39:02] you have so much faith
[2:39:04] in god's
[2:39:06] will for your life
[2:39:10] say lord
[2:39:11] whether this boat sinks or survives
[2:39:14] i know it's all in your will
[2:39:17] and none of the flailing around that i
[2:39:19] do will change that so i'm just going to
[2:39:21] go back here to the back of the boat
[2:39:23] lay down and take a nap and rest in your
[2:39:26] promises
[2:39:28] because that's the example he gave us
[2:39:31] because he stood up and he said oh ye of
[2:39:33] such little faith
[2:39:36] he said
[2:39:37] little faith little trust
[2:39:39] you had complete trust you were just
[2:39:41] pulled in the oars sat them down you all
[2:39:44] just continued your conversations
[2:39:45] together
[2:39:46] about all the miracles you just saw
[2:39:48] earlier today
[2:39:50] it just we would all just rested and
[2:39:52] slept and the boat would have gone where
[2:39:53] it needed to go
[2:39:55] but since you're afraid
[2:39:57] since you're afraid
[2:39:59] and you called on my name
[2:40:02] watch this
[2:40:04] now i don't know how many of you have
[2:40:06] been on boats before i haven't been on
[2:40:08] that many or even that rough of water
[2:40:11] i've been on a few boats on a few lakes
[2:40:13] with maybe a few waves
[2:40:17] but these waves were such that would
[2:40:19] sink a seagoing vessel
[2:40:24] maybe they were 20 feet high
[2:40:27] have you ever tried to stand in a boat
[2:40:31] with waves going through waves 20 feet
[2:40:33] high even four five six feet high
[2:40:38] jesus walked it says he walked to the
[2:40:40] front of the boat
[2:40:42] and put his foot on the bow
[2:40:48] he didn't stagger he didn't weave he
[2:40:51] didn't hold on to the disciples to help
[2:40:52] him get there
[2:40:54] like like it was the calmest ocean water
[2:40:57] the stillest mirror
[2:41:00] he stood up from his place sleeping
[2:41:03] walked to the front of the boat
[2:41:05] put his foot on the bow
[2:41:07] why
[2:41:08] because he knew the disciples needed to
[2:41:10] see him
[2:41:13] and needed to see a miracle
[2:41:15] to restore their faith
[2:41:18] they needed something from him
[2:41:20] and he said okay
[2:41:22] because of your little faith i'll do
[2:41:23] this for you
[2:41:25] i love you
[2:41:26] i'll show myself powerful to you
[2:41:30] i don't have to show myself powerful to
[2:41:31] be powerful
[2:41:33] if you would just believe it it would be
[2:41:35] so
[2:41:36] but i'll do it for you because you're my
[2:41:38] children i love you
[2:41:41] i'll prove myself to you once again even
[2:41:44] though you doubted
[2:41:46] even though you doubt it
[2:41:48] i'm going to show you no matter what
[2:41:49] life brings your way i'll carry you
[2:41:51] through
[2:41:52] i'll show you no matter how
[2:41:54] treacherous the waters of life
[2:41:57] it doesn't make a difference to me
[2:42:00] and he walks to the front of the bow
[2:42:02] puts his foot up on the bow
[2:42:05] and he says peace
[2:42:07] be still
[2:42:10] like that
[2:42:13] the storm clouds cleared
[2:42:15] waves went to nothing
[2:42:18] now if you've ever seen water after a
[2:42:20] storm just because the storm goes away
[2:42:22] doesn't mean the waves automatically die
[2:42:24] it takes time
[2:42:28] but when god speaks all nature has to
[2:42:31] obey
[2:42:32] the laws and physics of nature no longer
[2:42:34] apply
[2:42:37] the clouds cleared away the sun came out
[2:42:41] in fact
[2:42:42] i don't even think there was water in
[2:42:43] the boat anymore
[2:42:47] i don't know you can believe what you
[2:42:48] would like
[2:42:51] but it doesn't tell me anything a
[2:42:52] scripture of them continuing to baal
[2:42:56] they just said what manner of man is
[2:42:58] this
[2:43:00] they're in such
[2:43:01] shock and awe
[2:43:05] what manner of man is this
[2:43:09] that when he speaks
[2:43:11] the winds and the waves obey him
[2:43:14] you know many of us we we say we believe
[2:43:17] in god we say we know who god is
[2:43:20] we we say we know what he can do
[2:43:23] and yet that is sometimes our response
[2:43:26] because we're still learning to trust
[2:43:29] we're still learning to have faith
[2:43:31] it's still growing
[2:43:33] we're still
[2:43:34] maturing in christ
[2:43:36] and every once in a while he does
[2:43:38] something and we go
[2:43:39] what manner of man is this
[2:43:43] and we realized and then we realized
[2:43:46] this is not a man
[2:43:48] this is god almighty
[2:43:50] god himself wanting to show himself
[2:43:52] powerful to me
[2:43:54] let's just pray
[2:43:57] actually

[2:55:44] praising him for what's coming
[2:55:46] because we're going to be a part of it
[2:55:51] how sweet the sound i made
[2:56:02] [Music]
[2:56:09] i made
[2:56:11] oh
[2:56:17] [Music]
[2:56:28] was
[2:56:30] [Music]
[2:56:50] [Music]
[2:56:59] is
[2:57:01] [Music]
[2:57:08] me
[2:57:12] [Music]
[2:57:35] oh
[2:57:36] [Music]
[2:57:42] [Music]
[2:57:53] [Music]
[2:58:01] but something you're believing for
[2:58:04] [Music]
[2:58:08] [Applause]
[2:58:22] oh
[2:58:23] [Music]
[2:58:35] oh
[2:58:39] [Music]
[2:58:50] so
[2:59:01] [Music]
[2:59:05] oh
[2:59:08] [Music]
[2:59:22] [Music]
[2:59:28] just one moment one moment
[2:59:30] no i know i do this a lot
[2:59:33] but but i i
[2:59:35] it means that much to me
[2:59:37] okay
[2:59:38] and so just chalk it up to
[2:59:41] my own foolishness if you will
[2:59:44] but let's start at the very verse first
[2:59:46] and just quickly we're going to read
[2:59:48] this song
[2:59:50] okay
[2:59:51] amazing grace
[2:59:53] how sweet the sound
[2:59:55] i made it over
[2:59:57] so we're attributing amazing grace to
[2:59:59] have made it over
[3:00:01] now over
[3:00:03] i interpret it as i've already seen
[3:00:06] myself on the other side
[3:00:08] why because of amazing grace
[3:00:10] [Music]
[3:00:12] like think about that
[3:00:13] we're singing about the saving power
[3:00:16] that gets us all the way there
[3:00:20] now i once was lost we can all identify
[3:00:25] now i'm found why
[3:00:27] amazing grace i made it over
[3:00:29] [Music]
[3:00:31] saints
[3:00:32] these songs i and i know i i i i beat a
[3:00:36] dead horse with this but
[3:00:40] if we can catch us a glimpse
[3:00:44] and a revelation of what we're singing
[3:00:47] either
[3:00:49] either we we're still working on trying
[3:00:51] to trust that this is true
[3:00:54] or maybe we don't fully understand it or
[3:00:57] fully identify with it yet
[3:00:59] because if we did
[3:01:01] if we do
[3:01:04] no one would be able to stop us
[3:01:07] go to the next verse
[3:01:09] because grace that taught my heart to
[3:01:11] fear
[3:01:12] i made it over
[3:01:14] this is not a fear like the world sees
[3:01:16] it
[3:01:17] this is you you've grace taught you i
[3:01:20] can respect and trust in a mighty god to
[3:01:22] take me over
[3:01:24] how precious did that grace appear i
[3:01:26] made it over
[3:01:28] you're remembering that time when you
[3:01:30] met grace at calvary and you were set
[3:01:33] free
[3:01:34] and you're saying because of that that
[3:01:36] moment in time i can remember the place
[3:01:39] at the altar
[3:01:40] because of that the saving power of
[3:01:42] jesus christ his grace in my life i'm
[3:01:45] gonna make it over i can see myself on
[3:01:47] the other side already i'm not waiting
[3:01:50] to get there but by faith's eye i can
[3:01:54] see myself over next verse give me the
[3:01:57] next one
[3:02:00] through many dangers toils and snares i
[3:02:03] made it over right you see we can look
[3:02:05] at this and we can see the what we've
[3:02:07] already gone through we've made it
[3:02:09] through that god's carried us through so
[3:02:11] we can identify and say because of that
[3:02:13] i know no matter what's ahead of me i'm
[3:02:16] still going to make it over
[3:02:18] his grace has brought me safe this far i
[3:02:21] made it over saying grace brought me
[3:02:23] this far he's not going to leave me now
[3:02:26] i'm going to make it
[3:02:28] over are we at
[3:02:31] when now now where this really takes
[3:02:33] faith
[3:02:36] are you ready we're no longer singing
[3:02:37] about the past
[3:02:39] we're no longer singing about the
[3:02:40] present but we're singing about the
[3:02:42] future and we're saying when we've been
[3:02:45] there
[3:02:46] 10 000 years
[3:02:48] let that sink in most of us
[3:02:51] i've only been i can only identify with
[3:02:53] about 30 some years
[3:02:55] and i don't think anyone here can even
[3:02:57] identify with 100.
[3:02:59] quantify to 10 000 years
[3:03:02] when we've been there
[3:03:04] 10 000 years
[3:03:06] i made it over
[3:03:08] when we've been there 10 000 years by
[3:03:11] faith i believe we've no less days to
[3:03:14] sing god's praise once we've made it
[3:03:16] over
[3:03:18] so the ten thousand day ten thousand and
[3:03:20] one will be the same as day one
[3:03:24] think about that
[3:03:27] so if we're going to already know 10 000
[3:03:29] years is this the beginning of praising
[3:03:31] him
[3:03:32] what are we waiting for
[3:03:35] where are we at
[3:03:36] are we back to the beginning
[3:03:39] so
[3:03:40] put that in mind
[3:03:42] and now let's sing that song
[3:03:45] and sing it with that revelation
[3:03:48] of this is the i'm singing about the
[3:03:50] power
[3:03:51] to not only set me free and save me from
[3:03:54] myself and my sin but this is the power
[3:03:56] that's going to carry me through to the
[3:03:58] rest of eternity
[3:04:00] amazing grace how sweet the sound
[3:04:03] i made it
[3:04:08] once was lost but now i'm found i made
[3:04:12] it
[3:04:13] over
[3:04:15] [Music]
[3:04:29] [Music]
[3:04:41] when i made it
[3:04:45] [Music]
[3:05:00] through many dangerous
[3:05:03] [Music]
[3:05:14] oh
[3:05:16] [Music]
[3:05:19] [Applause]
