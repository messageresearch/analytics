[10:50] believeth on him that sent me as eternal
[10:54] life and shall never come to the
[10:56] judgment but pass from death unto life.
[11:00] Lord, they were yours when you spoke to
[11:03] them. They were yours before the
[11:05] foundation of the world. And tonight the
[11:08] gospel net has drawn them to you. They
[11:12] are yours.
[11:13] Care for them, oh Lord. We place them
[11:16] into thy hands.
[11:20] Tenderly, Lord, be merciful. And here's
[11:24] some of your children here that has
[11:27] iniquity in their hearts or they've done
[11:29] something. They've said something that's
[11:31] wrong.
[11:33] and maybe by hearing my testimony
[11:35] tonight that I did something wrong, had
[11:37] to go make it right,
[11:40] they come too, Lord, let the God that
[11:44] pass by that little whirlwind,
[11:47] let him pass over each heart here
[11:49] tonight,
[11:50] expelling their iniquity,
[11:53] washing them in the blood of the lamb,
[11:57] renewing their faith and their spirit.
[12:01] it
[12:03] into the great fellowship of the Holy
[12:07] Ghost.
[12:09] Granted, Lord, they're yours. They stand
[12:12] penitent making full confession before
[12:15] this audience of people that they've
[12:17] been wrong and they want to be right.
[12:21] And you said, "He that comes to me, I
[12:23] will in no wise cast out."
[12:26] We know that you're here, Lord, and will
[12:28] do it.
[12:31] Now, while we're waiting and they got
[12:33] their heads bowed, I wonder how many in
[12:35] here has not received the Holy Ghost as
[12:37] yet and would like to be remembered in
[12:39] prayer to receive the Holy Ghost. Raise
[12:42] your hand. God bless you.
[12:46] There's an altar, I think, to the right.
[12:48] There's an altar prepared right here.
[12:51] I'm asking these that standing here now,
[12:53] some of you there at the boy with a
[12:55] wheelchair, move right over to this
[12:56] altar right to my right here. We're
[12:58] going to meet you there just in a few
[12:59] minutes. Move right around that way. I'm
[13:01] going to ask you that hasn't got the
[13:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you would
[13:05] like to receive the Holy Ghost. Here's
[13:07] the time to start it. You're here on the
[13:09] campgrounds. You're here time to receive
[13:11] it. You know that no one will be in the
[13:14] rapture without the Holy Ghost. That'll
[13:17] be the sleeping virgin that'll not the
[13:19] rest of the dead live not for a thousand
[13:21] years. That's it. Move right out this
[13:23] way, my friends. That's it, Dad. All of
[13:25] you come right along here. Take young
[13:27] fella, push the boy there in the chair,
[13:29] will you? Right over here. Right down
[13:30] through this way. All of you, if you
[13:32] will, come right down through here. Now,
[13:34] just a kneel over here to give a little
[13:35] word of thanks to God for what he's done
[13:37] for you. Come right down this way. Now,
[13:40] you that wants the baptism of the Holy
[13:42] Ghost, would you come up also? Come
[13:44] right over here. Stand up on your feet
[13:46] and say, "I I'm I'm in business, Brother
[13:48] Brandon. I mean business with God. I've
[13:51] got a little word in my heart tonight
[13:53] and a little bit of spirit that tells me
[13:55] that if I mix this promise of God
[13:59] with the spirit that's telling me I can
[14:02] receive the Holy Ghost tonight, I'm
[14:04] coming to receive it. Is there enough
[14:06] spirit in you to tell you that God will
[14:08] do it for you tonight? If there is,
[14:10] raise up your hand. If you believe
[14:12] you've got enough courage in you,
[14:14] there's enough Holy Ghost conviction
[14:16] spirit telling you that tonight you can
[14:18] receive the baptism. If there is, come
[14:21] up here and let's have a word of prayer
[14:23] and go over here so we can lay hands on
[14:24] you and pray. Would you want to come? If
[14:27] you really want it, come now.
[14:33] That's right. Blessed are they that do
[14:35] hunger and thirst for righteousness, for
[14:38] they shall be filled. The Bible said so.
[14:42] God can't fail his words. What are you
[14:45] doing now? You're making preparations.
[14:48] How long have you sought the Holy Ghost?
[14:50] A long time.
[14:54] Long time have you sought the Holy
[14:56] Ghost. And now you sure tonight what
[14:59] happened? Maybe he was down just about
[15:01] ready to give up. But what's happened? I
[15:03] want some of the cooperating ministers
[15:05] if they will go over with these people
[15:07] here to instruct them how to
[15:10] pray and give thanks to God. Some
[15:12] ministers here that knows God. Any of
[15:16] you brothers here that knows God, come
[15:18] over there. Four or five of you go over
[15:20] there. And some of you stand right along
[15:22] in here with these here,
[15:24] we're going to pray for them.
[15:28] How many of you here's gospel ministers
[15:30] in the building? Raise up your hands.
[15:32] Gospel ministers, we're not questioning
[15:34] your denomination. We want you here.
[15:36] Come here. All you ministers, we need
[15:38] you here. Here's the time. All of you
[15:40] Elijah's come here.
[15:45] Here's the people. Let's mix the oil and
[15:48] the meal together.
[15:50] They're here to receive. They're here to
[15:54] get it.
[15:57] Let's come show that we have thus
[15:59] sayaeth the Lord.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the Holy Ghost is for you
[16:05] today?
[16:07] What did Peter say on the day of
[16:09] Pentecost
[16:10] when they said, "Man and brethren, what
[16:12] can we do?" He said, "Repent every one
[16:14] of you and be baptized in the name of
[16:16] Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and
[16:18] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[16:20] Ghost. For the promise is unto you and
[16:23] to your children, and to them that's far
[16:25] off, even as many as the Lord our God
[16:28] shall call." Is that right?
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Then you're here. What did they do in
[16:34] the Bible times? laid hands upon them.
[16:37] Now, we're going to pray for these
[16:39] people. All you ministers, stand by and
[16:41] pray. Then, we're going to take them
[16:43] over to the altars. And there, they're
[16:45] going to receive the Holy Ghost. Every
[16:47] one of them. Do you believe that?
[16:50] &gt;&gt; There's six nights of this service.
[16:52] Don't you come from your knees till the
[16:54] Holy Ghost has baptized you. Then
[16:56] there'll be a revival break out here.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Don't really mean business.
[17:01] We come to be in business. Now, we're
[17:04] going to do this. God promised it. The
[17:06] devil ain't going to rob us from it.
[17:07] We're going to stay here till it
[17:09] happens. That's right.
[17:12] Now, let us bow our heads. All you
[17:13] Christians, pray for these not seeking
[17:15] the Holy Ghost. You ministers along the
[17:17] side.
[17:19] Father, these sure are already confessed
[17:21] Christians,
[17:23] but they read in the Bible that just
[17:25] those who had oil in the land went in to
[17:28] the wedding supper.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; And they're coming tonight to receive
[17:33] the oil.
[17:35] They seem like a few minutes ago by
[17:37] having the meal already in the barrel
[17:40] there was spirit mixing around in there.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; They come for self-sacrifice
[17:47] to feel the hot burning fires of the
[17:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll light
[17:52] up the cross of Christ in their heart
[17:54] and will fill them with power and glory
[17:57] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[17:59] Granted, Lord, anointed ministers of God
[18:02] are standing by them.
[18:04] We are here, Lord, to pray the prayer of
[18:06] faith. We want to see a great revival
[18:09] break into this community and around
[18:11] here that'll make every church a burning
[18:14] blame. And we've come tonight to you,
[18:17] Lord, our God. We believe that you won't
[18:20] turn us down. May each of these from
[18:23] this little boy, little girl, all the
[18:25] way to the oldest receive the Holy
[18:28] Ghost.
[18:29] And as Christ said in the days gone by,
[18:32] as his servants, we say now, receive ye
[18:35] the Holy Ghost. Breathe upon them, Lord,
[18:38] the spirit of life. May they go now and
[18:41] receive the Holy Ghost.
[18:44] Now, take to the right. Each one of you
[18:46] seeking the Holy Ghost, go right this
[18:48] way. Ministers are going with you to go
[18:50] over there and stay there until the Holy
[18:52] Ghost comes. I want to deal with the
[18:54] rest of congregation just a minute.
[18:56] There'll be no prayers for the sick.
[18:57] Just remember that we're going to get
[18:59] things started right and then we're
[19:01] going to do right. It's going to come
[19:02] back. There's something wrong. We want
[19:05] it right.
[19:07] Amen. Go right this way over there.
[19:09] Ministers, you instructors go with them
[19:12] now. That don't purpose in your heart
[19:14] that you're not going to come off your
[19:17] knees if it takes from now till Saturday
[19:19] night. How long shall I carry until
[19:22] you're in due? How long is until you
[19:25] receive it?
[19:29] How many personal workers is in the
[19:31] building at work? Women or men? Raise
[19:34] your hands. Would like to go with these
[19:35] people. Bless you, Sister Rosella. All
[19:37] right. Would you go with them? Is
[19:39] someone else in here a good personal
[19:42] worker that would like to be standing
[19:44] present when the Holy Ghost fills
[19:46] someone? Would you like to do it? Any of
[19:48] you women, any of you men, you women, go
[19:51] to the women. You men go beside the man.
[19:53] Stand there. Be sincere. drive at the
[19:57] devil. Defeat him.
[20:00] He's a defeated person. Do you believe
[20:02] that? He's just a big bluff. He has no
[20:05] legal rights over us. We are free
[20:08] children born of the spirit of God. We
[20:10] have a right to this God's heritage and
[20:13] we believe it. Is there another in here
[20:15] that's a sinner that never come up and
[20:17] raise up their hand say, "Brother
[20:18] Random, remember me. I didn't even have
[20:20] the nerve to go, but pray for me that
[20:21] God will put such conviction on me that
[20:23] I will come the next time." Pray that
[20:25] God will spare my life. No accidents or
[20:28] nothing tonight. I'll be able to get out
[20:29] here again tomorrow night, raise your
[20:31] hand. Any person that's got iniquity in
[20:33] their heart, but they didn't come up.
[20:34] Raise your hand. Be honest about that.
[20:36] Raise your hand. Say, "Pray for me,
[20:38] Brother Brandham." How many sick and
[20:40] afflicted, raise up your hand, say, "I
[20:42] come. I want to be prayed for. I want to
[20:44] be right." All right. Confess all your
[20:46] wrongs now. You got from now until
[20:48] tomorrow, tomorrow night about this
[20:50] time, God's going to do more healings in
[20:52] here. I believe that he's ever done in
[20:54] this country. I believe it.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] The Lord bless you. All right, let us
[21:01] stand now when we sing. I need
[21:07] every hour.
[21:13] Dear God, in the name of Jesus, I pray
[21:16] for these nicks that you'll give unto
[21:19] them, oh Lord, the grace and power and
[21:22] heal ever these. I pray in Jesus name.
