[48:29] if you are there Say Amen
[48:34] and when eight days we accomplished for
[48:36] the circumcision of the child
[48:39] his name was called Jesus which was so
[48:42] named of the Angel before he was
[48:45] conceived in the womb
[48:47] and when the days of our purification
[48:49] according to the law of Moses were
[48:51] accomplished
[48:52] they brought him to Jerusalem to present
[48:55] him to the Lord as it is written in the
[48:58] law of the Lord every male that hope
[49:00] under the womb Shall be Called holy to
[49:03] the Lord
[49:04] and to offer his sacrifice according to
[49:07] that which he said in the law of the
[49:08] Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young
[49:11] pigeons
[49:12] and behold there was a man in Jerusalem
[49:16] whose name was Simeon and the same man
[49:18] was just and devote waiting for the
[49:22] consolation of Israel and the Holy
[49:25] Spirit was upon him and it was revealed
[49:28] unto him by the Holy Ghost
[49:30] that he should not see death before he
[49:34] had sinned the Lord's Christ
[49:36] and he came by the spirit into the
[49:38] temple and when the parents brought in
[49:41] the Child Jesus to do for him after the
[49:44] custom of the law then took him up in
[49:48] his arms and blessed God and said Lord
[49:51] now let thou thy servants depart him
[49:54] peace according to Thy Word
[49:56] for mine eyes I've seen thy salvation
[50:00] which that was prepared before the face
[50:02] of all people a light to lighten the
[50:06] Gentiles and the glory of thy People
[50:08] Israel and Joseph and his mother
[50:11] marveled are those things which were
[50:14] spoken of him
[50:15] and Simeon blessed them and said unto
[50:18] Mary's mother behold this child is set
[50:21] for the Fallen Rising again of many in
[50:24] Israel and for a sign which shall be
[50:27] spoken against yeah a salt shall pierce
[50:31] through thy own soul also that the
[50:34] thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
[50:37] and there was one honor a prophetess the
[50:40] daughter of fanuel of the tribe of Usher
[50:43] she was of a great age and had lived
[50:46] with an husband seven years from a
[50:48] virginity and she was a widow of about
[50:51] First Call in four years which departed
[50:54] not from the temple but served god with
[50:58] fastings and prayers night and day and
[51:01] she coming in that instant gave thanks
[51:04] likewise unto the Lord and speak of him
[51:08] to all them that looked for redemption
[51:11] in Jerusalem
[51:13] amen
[51:14] Luke chapter 18 sorry bear with me
[51:24] Luke 18 verse 18.
[51:30] 2 30.
[51:36] and a certain ruler asked him that's
[51:38] Verse 18 now Luke 18 18.
[51:42] and a certain ruler asked him saying
[51:44] good Master what shall I do to inherit
[51:47] eternal life and Jesus said unto him why
[51:51] call us thou May good none is good save
[51:54] one that is God thou knows the
[51:57] Commandments do not commit adultery do
[52:00] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[52:02] witness honor thy father and thy mother
[52:05] and he said all these have I kept from
[52:07] my youth up now when Jesus adds these
[52:11] things he said unto him yet one thing
[52:15] sell all the thou has and distribute
[52:18] unto the poor and thou shall have
[52:21] treasure in heaven and come follow me
[52:24] and when he had and when he had these he
[52:27] was very sorrowful for it was very rich
[52:30] and when Jesus saw that it was very
[52:32] sorrowful he said how hardly shall they
[52:35] that have riches enter into the kingdom
[52:38] of God for it is easier for a camel to
[52:41] go through a needle's eye than for a
[52:44] rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[52:46] God and did I heard it said who then can
[52:50] be saved and he said the things which
[52:52] are impossible with men are possible
[52:55] with God
[52:56] how many believe that
[52:59] then Peter said Lo we have left all and
[53:02] follow thee and he said unto them verily
[53:05] I see unto you there is no man that had
[53:08] left house or parents
[53:10] or Brethren or wife or children for the
[53:14] kingdom of God's sake who shall not
[53:17] receive manifold more in this present
[53:20] time and in the world to come life
[53:23] Everlasting
[53:25] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[53:29] reading of his holy war amen God bless
[53:31] you you may please be seated
[53:37] once again I would like to greet you all
[53:39] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:42] amen and I also
[53:46] represent or bring the greetings
[53:49] of the Saints back in Nigeria
[53:53] that's
[53:54] of
[53:55] the church where I
[53:59] identify wheat and also that of my
[54:04] family
[54:05] and everyone who at least
[54:09] maybe not know all of you but know your
[54:11] pastor because he was formerly a
[54:13] Nigerian
[54:14] before
[54:16] it was first in Liberia and then it
[54:19] became a Nigerian and now he's an
[54:21] American
[54:22] so we want to thank the Lord for him
[54:25] amen so everyone sends greetings and I
[54:29] want to thank the Lord for making it
[54:32] possible
[54:33] for me to be here at this time
[54:37] by my change of program I thought it
[54:41] wasn't going to work out again
[54:42] but Pastor here was
[54:47] insistence and somehow were able to
[54:50] adjust the program so I want to
[54:52] appreciate him very well for his love
[54:55] and
[54:57] for extending this arm of Fellowship to
[54:59] me yeah I appreciate you sir and I
[55:04] appreciate also the privilege to see all
[55:06] of you again amen when I saw my friends
[55:09] before they were just new couple now
[55:12] they've graduated I guess yeah and they
[55:15] are looking like graduates
[55:17] from just being married couples to
[55:20] parents now and we are thankful to God
[55:23] for that it's the goodness of the Lord
[55:26] and I pray that that which the Lord has
[55:29] begun will be permanent I am so happy to
[55:32] see all of you I also graduated since
[55:35] the last time I came here I graduated
[55:38] from being parents to be grandparents so
[55:41] the Lord has been so good to all of us
[55:44] and I pray you continue to do that amen
[55:48] so I'm so happy to be in your midst
[55:50] tonight I came into the U.S was uh
[55:54] today's Wednesday Monday night and I
[55:57] flew into Washington so
[55:59] spend a day with the Saints there before
[56:02] traveling down today and they told me
[56:04] also to pass their greetings to the
[56:07] Believers here so we're glad I'm so glad
[56:10] to be here tonight and it was just laid
[56:15] upon my heart to speak on the subject of
[56:18] expectation
[56:20] I do not know if I've ever spoken on
[56:22] that year before
[56:24] but
[56:25] this is what the Lord has placed upon my
[56:29] heart tonight and I believe it will
[56:31] reinforce the blessings of the weekends
[56:33] that I missed yeah but here in the
[56:36] pastor talking about it I believe that
[56:40] something very good must have taken
[56:42] place and if that happened I believe
[56:45] since I have an expectation
[56:47] uh blessings some fall out of those
[56:51] meetings so I'm just here tonight to
[56:53] reinforce that in your heart
[56:55] yeah the it's a great thing to have
[56:58] expectation and I'm glad to see my
[57:01] landlady
[57:04] just in case you don't know this is my
[57:06] first landlady in Minnesota
[57:08] many years ago amen and
[57:12] I appreciate all of you thank you for
[57:16] everything so tonight we'll be speaking
[57:19] on expectation
[57:21] and the first thought I would like for
[57:25] us to know
[57:27] is that Christianity itself is based on
[57:31] the expectation
[57:34] uh we are not in a relationship with God
[57:37] that looks like uh
[57:40] God if you rub my back I will rob yours
[57:44] that is not exactly so
[57:47] Christianity is a
[57:50] if you cannot scratch my back I will
[57:53] still scratch yours anyway if it is
[57:56] necessary
[57:57] so we are not doing things for selfish
[58:00] motives
[58:01] we are not doing things to even get
[58:03] something back in return
[58:05] amen we have Revelations like the three
[58:08] Hebrew children
[58:09] and until your Christianity come to such
[58:13] level you are still an off-bed plant
[58:16] the Hebrew children knew the ability of
[58:19] God they know what God can do
[58:22] but they also have the revelation of the
[58:25] sovereignty of God
[58:28] it is not everything God can do
[58:31] that he is willing to do at every time
[58:35] and it will never change him from being
[58:37] God that was why they could tell
[58:40] Nebuchadnezzar they say oh King live
[58:42] forever
[58:44] he said will not bow down to your image
[58:47] we know our God yes
[58:49] can deliver us
[58:52] so the ability of God is not in doubt
[58:55] yes to the Believers but they also told
[58:58] the king in case he chooses not to
[59:02] not because he cannot right but he may
[59:06] choose not to
[59:08] like the prophet said is yes and his
[59:10] nose they are the same thing to the
[59:12] believer
[59:14] yet we will still not bow down to your
[59:17] image amen so they have tall
[59:20] expectations of God's ability but they
[59:24] are not expecting it like uh uh if you
[59:27] do me this I would do you that I pray
[59:30] the spirit of the Lord will expand that
[59:32] in your heart but nevertheless
[59:35] Christianity has something in it for
[59:38] every believer
[59:40] praise the Lord Apostle Paul said if it
[59:43] is only in this life that you and I have
[59:45] hope hey bro of Willie God bless you I'm
[59:49] just seeing them one after the other God
[59:51] bless you my sister he said if it is
[59:53] only in this life I'm proceed those are
[59:55] our grandparents
[59:58] if it is only in this life that you and
[1:00:00] I have hope we have all men the most
[1:00:04] miserable
[1:00:05] amen so in other words our coming every
[1:00:08] night Define the odds coming every
[1:00:11] Sunday when there are other things we
[1:00:14] could have busy ourselves with is not
[1:00:17] going to be for nothing
[1:00:22] there are blessings there are reward for
[1:00:24] it and I'm yet to encourage you tonight
[1:00:27] because we are living at a time that the
[1:00:30] Bible said that day of the Lord will not
[1:00:33] come
[1:00:33] until there be a falling away first
[1:00:36] and a lot of Crash is coming up here and
[1:00:40] there
[1:00:41] and they could be very discouraging but
[1:00:44] in the midst of this we must still
[1:00:46] strengthen that which remains and one of
[1:00:49] the ways to strengthen that which
[1:00:51] remains is to refresh yes
[1:00:54] the hope that make it not ashamed so I'm
[1:00:57] here to tell you tonight that for all
[1:01:00] your Christian sacrifices label worship
[1:01:02] consecration
[1:01:04] there is something in it for you
[1:01:06] [Applause]
[1:01:09] so don't be tired of your worship you
[1:01:12] know God told the prophet he said if
[1:01:14] only you knew what lays ahead it's like
[1:01:17] keep pressing on
[1:01:19] keep pressing on so my message to the
[1:01:22] church tonight is keep pressing on
[1:01:24] because there is something great ahead
[1:01:27] for you and I
[1:01:30] the Journey of a Christian Life when God
[1:01:33] started it with Abraham
[1:01:35] started as a journey of expectation
[1:01:38] you know why
[1:01:40] God never told Abraham where he was
[1:01:43] taken him right
[1:01:45] he only told him he said pack your bags
[1:01:48] and everything that would be our modern
[1:01:49] language
[1:01:50] and start going to a place that I will
[1:01:53] show you
[1:01:55] if you told that to your neighbor your
[1:01:57] neighbor will tell you calm down wait
[1:02:00] till you are shown so you can put it on
[1:02:03] Google Map and it gives you direction to
[1:02:06] the place is that right
[1:02:07] but Abraham never waited till he was
[1:02:10] shown he packed this bag he came to the
[1:02:13] junction I was trusting God for the next
[1:02:15] turn yes
[1:02:18] and wherever it's going to be he didn't
[1:02:21] know what it held for him
[1:02:23] but you see it's a Journey of Faith yeah
[1:02:26] and it was expecting that God would take
[1:02:29] care of things for him amen and you see
[1:02:32] Abraham was so convinced of God's
[1:02:35] ability
[1:02:36] to take care of his instruction to him
[1:02:39] until the Bible said it came to a
[1:02:42] conclusion that he was looking for a
[1:02:44] city
[1:02:46] the Arts Foundation
[1:02:48] whose Builder and maker is God
[1:02:51] and because of the strength of that
[1:02:54] expectation in his heart he never minded
[1:02:57] living like a pilgrim in the book of
[1:03:00] Hebrews chapter 11 he said there that
[1:03:03] says such things in other words they
[1:03:05] that kid into Abraham's lifestyle into
[1:03:08] Abraham's faith into Abraham's kind of
[1:03:11] expectation he said that we are saying
[1:03:14] it all about
[1:03:15] that we are looking for a city
[1:03:17] and there were so many things that came
[1:03:20] along their way as a challenge
[1:03:22] so many experiences until the Bible says
[1:03:25] those experiences were strong enough for
[1:03:28] them
[1:03:29] to use as an excuse to go back if they
[1:03:34] are not mindful of where they are going
[1:03:37] now where they were going was a journey
[1:03:39] of expectation
[1:03:41] because they couldn't even show it to
[1:03:43] another person
[1:03:47] are you catching it
[1:03:50] so and that expectation influenced their
[1:03:53] living
[1:03:55] they lived as pilgrims they lived as
[1:03:58] strangers yet they were not poor or
[1:04:01] frustrated but in the midst of the
[1:04:04] achievement wealth and success they
[1:04:06] never dig deep they never relaxed on age
[1:04:09] because they have a hope of a better
[1:04:11] country
[1:04:13] and that is the way we are going to live
[1:04:15] also if this expectation becomes a
[1:04:19] revelation in our hearts
[1:04:21] tonight
[1:04:23] I'm serving God because I also have
[1:04:25] expectations
[1:04:27] I know they'll be a rapture
[1:04:30] and I'm expecting it
[1:04:32] I know there will be a wedding supper
[1:04:33] and I'm expecting it I know there will
[1:04:36] be a millennium and I'm expecting it I
[1:04:40] know there will be an eternal living in
[1:04:42] a Four Square City in a city that John
[1:04:45] saw coming down and I'm expecting it
[1:04:49] all these things are propelling my
[1:04:51] desire to serve God's the more he said
[1:04:55] let others seek at home below I feel
[1:04:58] like traveling on I might not be able to
[1:05:01] show it to somebody else but it is real
[1:05:03] to me that this thing exists
[1:05:06] and why would I expect because somebody
[1:05:09] promised me
[1:05:10] and I know the strength of Israel can
[1:05:13] never lie and that is why I wouldn't
[1:05:15] need anybody to push me
[1:05:17] amen I'm already pushed by my
[1:05:20] expectation
[1:05:21] I wouldn't need anybody to encourage me
[1:05:23] to come to church I will come to church
[1:05:25] I will serve him I will walk in the
[1:05:29] light I will abide in the truth I will
[1:05:32] make my banner clear I will let my
[1:05:34] moderation to be known to all men I will
[1:05:37] tell it to everybody that the Lord is at
[1:05:40] hand because I'm expecting
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:45] if this hope is in your heart also you
[1:05:48] will do the same
[1:05:50] live like a pilgrim you will live like a
[1:05:53] stranger when you have dull or slow
[1:05:56] moments those things will come to your
[1:05:58] mind and it will refresh your heart to
[1:06:01] keep serving the lord you say how do you
[1:06:03] know that was what he did for others
[1:06:06] this sense we are talking about they
[1:06:08] were mere mortals just like we were the
[1:06:11] Bible said Elijah was a man of like
[1:06:13] passion just as we are meaning that he
[1:06:16] has his moments of appointment he has
[1:06:18] his moments of disappointment but
[1:06:20] something kept them going whatever kept
[1:06:23] them going can keep us going because
[1:06:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:06:28] forever they had moment to be
[1:06:30] discouraged they saw bread and also fell
[1:06:33] away
[1:06:34] Paul told us of edemas who was so
[1:06:36] fervent amen who forsook him but in all
[1:06:40] these things Paul never went back that's
[1:06:42] right so we will suffer from him for a
[1:06:45] second who will suffer rejection that's
[1:06:47] right just as they did
[1:06:49] but something must keep you going and
[1:06:53] what will keep you going is expectation
[1:06:57] if you love him tonight I hope I'm
[1:07:00] simple enough
[1:07:03] as you have expectation
[1:07:07] God also has expectation
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:11] God is expecting to see a church
[1:07:15] without sport
[1:07:17] without the wrinkle
[1:07:19] a glorious church until sin cannot abide
[1:07:23] in it amen the prophet said the spirit
[1:07:27] of the Lord is calling for that wherever
[1:07:29] it is there will be a generation that
[1:07:31] will meet that desire
[1:07:33] amen nature Housewives expectation
[1:07:37] according to the scriptures Romans
[1:07:39] chapter 5 told us
[1:07:41] that the Earth is groaning
[1:07:43] amen
[1:07:45] who is it grown into is not grown into
[1:07:47] God
[1:07:48] it's grown into you you know why because
[1:07:52] the Earth knew how it was before the
[1:07:54] fall yes right in the dispensation of
[1:07:57] Innocence imperfection and the Earth
[1:08:00] feels that I've enjoyed the two sides I
[1:08:03] feel more comfortable with this one
[1:08:06] so the Earth is groaning for a
[1:08:08] restoration yeah because there will be
[1:08:10] one he's going for a restoration of that
[1:08:13] Perfection that's right the prophet said
[1:08:15] the Earth is tired of sucking innocent
[1:08:18] blood
[1:08:18] it starts of the violence the perversion
[1:08:22] that has taken over the Earth and they
[1:08:24] wanted a restoration back to the
[1:08:26] original beginning that's right and the
[1:08:28] Earth knew that they will never get back
[1:08:30] to that beginning you think nature does
[1:08:33] not know some things nature new and
[1:08:35] still does
[1:08:36] nature didn't fall
[1:08:39] nature is only suffering from our fall
[1:08:44] that is why the trees are still bearing
[1:08:47] their fruits in their season right amen
[1:08:49] if you studied nature very well animals
[1:08:52] have never changed their disposition
[1:08:54] we are the one that got out of our range
[1:08:57] yes if we get back to our range lion
[1:08:59] will bow to us he will not charge at us
[1:09:02] Amen in terms of everything Anatomy
[1:09:07] about animal even to the appropriation
[1:09:09] style it still has God left it it's only
[1:09:12] men that moved out of range
[1:09:14] when you study the scriptures when you
[1:09:16] studied the message so that is why
[1:09:18] nature still held its originality and
[1:09:21] they knew what will take him back to the
[1:09:24] Bliss the comfort in one's art and that
[1:09:28] is why they are groaning
[1:09:31] for what
[1:09:32] to see the manifestation of the Sons and
[1:09:35] Daughters of God it is you being
[1:09:38] restored that will bring peace yes Back
[1:09:41] To Nature yes so nature also has
[1:09:43] expectation
[1:09:45] husbands could have expectation of why
[1:09:48] of their wives
[1:09:49] the wives will have expectation of
[1:09:51] husbands right right the children will
[1:09:53] have expectations of parents
[1:09:57] and it goes on and on and on and on like
[1:10:01] that amen
[1:10:03] may the Lord help us
[1:10:07] but let me say something
[1:10:10] the prophet said the first rule of
[1:10:12] expectation
[1:10:13] is that every man will get what he
[1:10:16] expects
[1:10:20] that means the lesson of that is that in
[1:10:24] expecting we must remain positive
[1:10:28] if you expect to see something negative
[1:10:30] you will get it
[1:10:32] brother Brahm said don't ever allow the
[1:10:35] devil to point an accusing finger at me
[1:10:37] to you in the message whoever true
[1:10:40] Prophet is that if you allow him he will
[1:10:43] show you plenty
[1:10:45] but those plenty things you are seeing
[1:10:47] they are pure Mirage
[1:10:49] they actually don't exist
[1:10:51] but your spiritual eye pigments could be
[1:10:54] programmed to see things that are not
[1:10:56] there
[1:10:57] because physically you see sometimes
[1:11:00] things that don't exist right you are
[1:11:03] traveling on the road
[1:11:04] amen and you look ahead of you and you
[1:11:07] lose as if you are seeing water
[1:11:10] flooding the road but you keep traveling
[1:11:12] towards the water there was no water
[1:11:15] but your eyes is telling you there's
[1:11:17] something that looks like water
[1:11:19] and English people are science call it a
[1:11:22] mirage
[1:11:23] something that looks real but it's not
[1:11:25] existing yeah
[1:11:28] and also the prophet said the devil can
[1:11:30] paint a picture
[1:11:32] I make it so real but it's not actually
[1:11:35] existing
[1:11:39] so if you are wired to expect negative
[1:11:43] you will see things that are negative
[1:11:45] but they are not real
[1:11:48] this is why the prophet said don't ever
[1:11:50] ever be negative
[1:11:53] always be positive
[1:12:01] let me tell you
[1:12:04] for you to have expectation
[1:12:08] God appreciate it
[1:12:10] and they will never deny you
[1:12:13] even sometimes if it takes you asking
[1:12:16] God for some confirmation he knows how
[1:12:19] it feels because God knows where he has
[1:12:21] taken each of us
[1:12:24] this takes me to the second scripture
[1:12:26] where we read I will start from the
[1:12:27] second scripture before I come to the
[1:12:29] first
[1:12:31] we read a scenario that doesn't look
[1:12:33] like our subjects but let me bring that
[1:12:36] money for you
[1:12:39] the Bible spoke of a Rich Young Ruler
[1:12:42] here
[1:12:44] that's what Rich Young Ruler Summers
[1:12:47] arises every human achievement
[1:12:50] people want to be rich
[1:12:52] when they get money they also want Power
[1:12:55] when they get power they want to have
[1:12:57] enough years
[1:12:59] to enjoy their status
[1:13:03] that is why they struggle is so much
[1:13:05] when you are young if you are serious
[1:13:08] but let me tell you you could have all
[1:13:11] these things
[1:13:13] and by the time you have them you will
[1:13:16] still feel empty
[1:13:18] you will still feel unsatisfied because
[1:13:21] this is not the Pinnacle of achievement
[1:13:26] and that was why this man was young
[1:13:29] rich
[1:13:31] powerful a ruler so his God wealth he's
[1:13:34] got power and his God age
[1:13:37] working for him
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:40] but despite all this great credential of
[1:13:43] achievement
[1:13:45] something in his heart tells him
[1:13:47] something is still missing
[1:13:49] that void can only be filled
[1:13:53] with eternal life
[1:13:57] so with all your getting tonight
[1:14:00] I want you to get eternal life amen if
[1:14:03] you are not if you don't readily have it
[1:14:06] you must be born again
[1:14:10] look that gospel can never go out of
[1:14:13] fashion
[1:14:15] it is the essence of your life
[1:14:17] if only life you have is the natural
[1:14:20] flesh life
[1:14:22] your expectation is short your
[1:14:25] expectations will be caught short
[1:14:27] because job said a man that is born of
[1:14:31] woman
[1:14:32] is full of troubles and a few days
[1:14:36] mind it's a life of crisis
[1:14:40] it's a life that is not worth
[1:14:41] celebrating I tell people birthday
[1:14:44] celebration only makes sense
[1:14:46] if you have been Reborn
[1:14:48] because without that you are just
[1:14:50] celebrating failure and death
[1:14:54] oh yes that's scriptural
[1:14:59] you love him tonight
[1:15:02] so this guy had everything but despite
[1:15:06] all that it was constantly filled having
[1:15:09] a feeling of avoiding him yeah
[1:15:12] so he kept running elter scatter from
[1:15:15] church to church from religion to
[1:15:18] religion it wasn't a bad guy I want you
[1:15:20] to get the foundation he was a good
[1:15:23] church boy
[1:15:25] he never lived a reckless life no no it
[1:15:28] was somebody right from his youth you
[1:15:31] know that gave himself committed himself
[1:15:33] to religion amen
[1:15:37] amen but despite religious commitment
[1:15:40] and religious achievement physical
[1:15:42] achievement political achievement
[1:15:44] everything achievement which it got
[1:15:47] loved by fraudulent means
[1:15:51] I'll prove that by the scripture
[1:15:53] he still has this void in his heart
[1:15:57] that he needed something more
[1:16:02] and he had an opportunity to come in
[1:16:04] contact with the solution one day
[1:16:08] and as a good Master what must I do to
[1:16:10] be saved and the good Master said
[1:16:14] go observe the law you know what the law
[1:16:17] says the good Master knew his need
[1:16:20] but for your sake he wanted to start the
[1:16:23] journey with him from somewhere so we
[1:16:26] can learn a lesson it started with him
[1:16:28] from religion
[1:16:30] and that guy said you know master from
[1:16:32] my youth up
[1:16:35] he never had a Reckless Youth age
[1:16:38] right I have kept all these things
[1:16:42] and the whole scene high before um
[1:16:45] nothing could be hidden right looked
[1:16:47] into that life
[1:16:50] penetrated his entire being
[1:16:53] and he said he was telling the truth
[1:16:55] yeah
[1:16:56] yeah if you stood here tonight his
[1:16:58] credential will be better than some of
[1:17:00] us
[1:17:01] right
[1:17:02] without getting saying
[1:17:04] this is how far religion can take you
[1:17:06] and I and yet we still don't have it
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:11] so let's think on our ways tonight
[1:17:14] there was a young boy in the church
[1:17:17] when in the Church of the Prophet under
[1:17:19] the pastorship of brother Abraham
[1:17:22] the prophet said this guy was so good
[1:17:24] he's taking his position in the church
[1:17:26] it became even a good influence a
[1:17:29] reference point that you can say don't
[1:17:31] you see this young man
[1:17:34] but when it started you know into
[1:17:36] marriage
[1:17:39] is inadequacy became open
[1:17:41] something will always expose you
[1:17:46] so don't assume make sure
[1:17:51] are you with me Brethren I'm not
[1:17:53] preaching a straight jacket it's the
[1:17:54] seventh seal so it touches here and
[1:17:56] there for those who might be wondering
[1:17:58] is this part of expectation it is part
[1:18:00] of expectation
[1:18:03] praise the Lord and I have Sunday so if
[1:18:05] I don't finish tonight I will continue
[1:18:06] don't worry amen the essence is that you
[1:18:09] must get the canals amen
[1:18:12] he started a relationship and during
[1:18:15] courtship they realized that he will
[1:18:17] promise to do something for that girl
[1:18:19] okay maybe I'll help you stop over this
[1:18:22] and that there are many things you could
[1:18:24] make promises about and you are not able
[1:18:26] to do it but how you handle it is
[1:18:28] important yes
[1:18:31] he wouldn't even be able to say sorry
[1:18:35] it was like a it was like a song
[1:18:38] who never learns the virtue of apology
[1:18:41] it will only give you reasons
[1:18:44] why he cannot do the right thing
[1:18:49] reasons we may learn from but it doesn't
[1:18:52] take care of repentance
[1:18:54] are you catching it
[1:18:56] all right then the prophet that the
[1:18:58] parents at some point became concerned
[1:19:01] and they came to the prophet what is
[1:19:03] wrong with our boy
[1:19:05] and the prophet looked at that boy's
[1:19:07] life despite his religious Church
[1:19:09] credentials he said what he needs it
[1:19:12] might be a good boy in the church but in
[1:19:14] his regeneration do you know the parent
[1:19:17] protested that if they say we know our
[1:19:19] boy he's a Christian brother Brahm said
[1:19:22] it's always unpopular if you have to
[1:19:24] take this position for somebody who had
[1:19:26] said amen to every word in the church
[1:19:28] who is trying to live a good life he was
[1:19:31] trying to you know be civil do
[1:19:34] everything around and you come back and
[1:19:35] said he is not yet converted he said but
[1:19:38] if you want to hear the truth that's the
[1:19:40] condition of the boy then he traced it
[1:19:43] to you know genetic traits
[1:19:46] that are passed them from parents it's
[1:19:48] not only sickness or disease that are
[1:19:50] passed down characters are also passed
[1:19:52] down so genetics as the physical and the
[1:19:56] spiritual aspect
[1:19:59] you know and I said you you are like
[1:20:02] this your wife was like this when you
[1:20:05] break this boy you bred him in your body
[1:20:07] so the natural traits from you and your
[1:20:10] wife came into this boy now what made
[1:20:13] the change for you today is because you
[1:20:15] have met Christ the same way you met
[1:20:17] Christ that young man has got to admit
[1:20:20] Christ and make sure he does before
[1:20:23] going into marriage otherwise it will
[1:20:25] make hell for that guy I
[1:20:29] so we can be churchy but not converted
[1:20:33] so this is the case of the Rich Young
[1:20:35] Ruler he has observed all the law
[1:20:38] but I see what God demanded was the
[1:20:40] righteousness that surpasses that of the
[1:20:42] Pharisee Pharisees righteousness is
[1:20:46] almost impeccable it goes far
[1:20:48] said as touching the law I am blameless
[1:20:52] a Pharisee of the Pharisee and yet he
[1:20:55] wasn't a Christian
[1:20:57] read your Bible is that
[1:21:00] he couldn't even recognize his day and
[1:21:02] his message he was still persecuting
[1:21:04] Christians
[1:21:07] so this Rich Young Ruler had a tall
[1:21:10] credential and when he said he has
[1:21:13] observed all those things the eye of God
[1:21:15] looked into his life and said yes you've
[1:21:18] done that
[1:21:19] because when that high examine his life
[1:21:22] he finds just one thing left
[1:21:27] is that your problem is not any of these
[1:21:30] things your problem is that your wealth
[1:21:34] you will never want to give up anything
[1:21:36] for this money that is what you worship
[1:21:39] right yours may not be that God dealt
[1:21:42] with him personally
[1:21:44] yours may not be money
[1:21:46] yours may be something else
[1:21:48] but anything you don't feel like giving
[1:21:50] up even at the risk of God
[1:21:54] that is your snare amen that is that
[1:21:57] thing that you must actually overcome
[1:22:01] but because he had so many possessions
[1:22:06] many possessions are not always the
[1:22:08] money alone bad habits could be your
[1:22:10] possession and you can fill in the gap
[1:22:15] and you feel the cost of giving it up is
[1:22:18] too great for Christ nothing must
[1:22:20] contend with Christ in our life
[1:22:24] there's anything that ever comes in
[1:22:26] contention even for comparison that is
[1:22:29] the god you presently serve
[1:22:31] in that nature that God has got to die
[1:22:34] because God is not going to married a
[1:22:37] married woman with a living husband
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:42] because it's not a b it's not going to
[1:22:45] Fellowship in adultery that is why it
[1:22:48] demands the death of that nature to free
[1:22:51] you from the headship of that nature and
[1:22:54] make you a single person again worthy
[1:22:56] for his own marriage
[1:22:57] because God is never going to join
[1:23:00] himself into adultery
[1:23:03] and that is the reason many of us are in
[1:23:05] the church
[1:23:06] but we are not converted we don't
[1:23:08] receive Christ
[1:23:09] we could observe our religion do many
[1:23:12] things but we are not still ready to let
[1:23:14] go
[1:23:15] Christ will never break his principle
[1:23:18] for nobody
[1:23:19] he said brother Brahm said many wanted
[1:23:22] him to lure it to accommodate their
[1:23:25] lifestyle he said but no he's going to
[1:23:27] raise it
[1:23:28] and you must rise
[1:23:33] you love him to
[1:23:35] him going good for my young friends
[1:23:37] yeah I'm taking time because I see young
[1:23:39] folks here amen the Lord bless you amen
[1:23:43] so when God told him this is what you
[1:23:46] need to do
[1:23:48] the Bible said the cost was great for
[1:23:50] him so he left he would rather choose
[1:23:53] his wealth and reject Christ now
[1:23:56] everybody thought when this man rejected
[1:23:59] Christ since with nose die for him but
[1:24:02] you make mistakes sometimes
[1:24:07] if it happens it reject Christ it will
[1:24:10] get more wealth yeah
[1:24:13] are you hearing me I say it with all
[1:24:15] sense of responsibility
[1:24:18] it wouldn't tamper with anything the
[1:24:21] only person God goes after
[1:24:23] is his own seat praise the Lord it makes
[1:24:27] life you know so difficult for you
[1:24:29] till you find him a necessary necessity
[1:24:33] the prophet said it would do everything
[1:24:35] equivalent lay you on the bed of
[1:24:37] sickness until you call for Spiritual
[1:24:39] Daddy call Daddy now I want to make it
[1:24:42] all right amen
[1:24:43] so if he's not after you
[1:24:47] you should be sorry for yourself
[1:24:49] the Bible told us Ken went out of the
[1:24:51] presence of the Lord did God run after
[1:24:53] him no he left him
[1:24:56] he even put a mark on him so that nobody
[1:24:58] will hurt him right but Kane lived and
[1:25:01] he lived a terrible life till he left
[1:25:04] but there was a Jonah who ran from God's
[1:25:07] presence
[1:25:08] and God said this one I'm going after
[1:25:10] him
[1:25:11] because he must bring all his sons
[1:25:14] unto glory and the beginning of their
[1:25:17] glory is to bring them to conform first
[1:25:19] with his will
[1:25:22] so he's not going to give up on you he's
[1:25:24] not going to leave you
[1:25:26] right you say It's my life I want to
[1:25:28] leave it no you make a mistake it's not
[1:25:30] your life he gave you that life
[1:25:33] and the one who manufactures a product
[1:25:36] is the one who has a right to determine
[1:25:39] the purpose of that product
[1:25:43] you were born out unnecessarily
[1:25:45] until you have this Revelation and
[1:25:47] submit to it
[1:25:50] so when this guy left you see the
[1:25:53] disciples the rest we are watching the
[1:25:55] scenario
[1:25:56] and they were wondering yeah you say
[1:25:58] he's going to have life tough but he
[1:26:00] never had it off brother Brahm said he
[1:26:02] was the same guy that the Lord pictured
[1:26:06] as coming to a point of too much wealth
[1:26:09] and it all his own soul relax enjoy you
[1:26:13] have so much he was the same guy that
[1:26:16] was pictured with Lazarus yeah that's
[1:26:18] according to the message of the hour
[1:26:20] amen that couldn't even return good
[1:26:23] virtues again it became so numb
[1:26:26] until it cannot even give Comfort to any
[1:26:29] support to Lazarus he must have told
[1:26:31] Lazarus if I follow that your Jesus I
[1:26:34] would have ended up like you are right
[1:26:38] everything around them reinforce the
[1:26:40] need for him to reject Christ but it was
[1:26:43] getting richer and richer yeah when the
[1:26:46] disciples when they saw this they became
[1:26:48] confused
[1:26:49] sure
[1:26:51] because they also had a background
[1:26:54] Follow Me Now
[1:26:56] it's going to harmonize for our subject
[1:26:58] now they also had a background
[1:27:01] uh everybody that God ever brings to
[1:27:04] himself as a background and what Christ
[1:27:07] demanded of that Rich Young Ruler
[1:27:10] is exactly what is demanding of every
[1:27:14] child that comes to God you must be
[1:27:17] willing to forsake one thing or the
[1:27:19] other
[1:27:22] right are you with me yes
[1:27:24] yes you must be willing to give up
[1:27:26] something
[1:27:27] for the sake of the Kingdom
[1:27:31] so they knew their own background they
[1:27:33] knew what they gave off
[1:27:38] when they didn't see this man suffering
[1:27:40] for his rejection they had to come to
[1:27:43] Christ you know they must have pushed me
[1:27:46] to ask the question pop it up to him
[1:27:48] because we need some Assurance now right
[1:27:52] and that was why Peter came to ask sir
[1:27:56] the background is that this Rich wrong
[1:27:58] ruler
[1:28:00] was offered the same invitation like you
[1:28:02] offered us he rejected you and yet
[1:28:05] nothing seemed to tamper with him he's
[1:28:06] going fine
[1:28:08] but you know sir where we are coming
[1:28:09] from
[1:28:10] Lord we have left all yes
[1:28:14] what is going to be in there for us
[1:28:17] yeah now somebody may expect that to be
[1:28:21] a canal question
[1:28:24] but until you understand we are Peter
[1:28:27] and the rest are coming from you will
[1:28:29] not appreciate their question but the
[1:28:32] one they were asking the Lord knew it
[1:28:35] the impression many of us had was that
[1:28:38] Peter and the rest of them maybe they
[1:28:39] were poor frustrated people
[1:28:42] you will struggle to have a scripture
[1:28:44] for that right
[1:28:48] did you did you hear me you will
[1:28:50] struggle to have a scripture for that
[1:28:53] yeah I want to tell you tonight that
[1:28:55] Peter was wealthy
[1:28:57] and I will prove it by the scripture
[1:29:00] I want to tell you tonight that James
[1:29:02] and John was wealthy Matthew was a
[1:29:06] career tax officer yes
[1:29:09] yes all of them had great things going
[1:29:12] on for them in life
[1:29:13] what the scripture told of Peter and
[1:29:16] some was that they were ignorant and on
[1:29:18] lineage
[1:29:19] not being educated is different from not
[1:29:22] being wealthy
[1:29:23] it's got nothing to do together
[1:29:26] in my own country the African richest
[1:29:29] billionaire had no education if if ad
[1:29:32] education it didn't go past the
[1:29:34] secondary school education but today he
[1:29:37] employed phds and professors
[1:29:40] and his wealth is in billions of dollars
[1:29:42] is the richest African and I think
[1:29:45] number six or so in the world
[1:29:48] so being rich and being educated through
[1:29:52] different things so what the Bible chose
[1:29:54] is what he said they are ignorant and
[1:29:56] non-learned he never told you that they
[1:29:58] are poor
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:03] you want me to prove it to you let's
[1:30:05] take a little proof can you please put
[1:30:06] Luke Chapter 5 on the board for us
[1:30:09] let's take a little proof
[1:30:12] because I want you to see the power of
[1:30:14] expectation
[1:30:17] when Peter asked that question are they
[1:30:20] putting it for us when Peter asked that
[1:30:22] question Lord we have left all he meant
[1:30:26] every sense of that word
[1:30:28] and Jesus who understood never rebuked
[1:30:31] Peter
[1:30:32] it is a case of Peter I understand
[1:30:36] nobody ever leaves anything for me what
[1:30:39] Jesus realized was that these people
[1:30:41] wanted something yeah
[1:30:43] to expect to look up to for all their
[1:30:46] sacrifices their choice that they have
[1:30:48] made they wanted to be sure that they
[1:30:51] had not been defrauded they wanted to be
[1:30:54] sure of the outcome of their Investments
[1:30:59] and Christ has to offer that because
[1:31:02] Christianity is based on expectation
[1:31:06] when the revelation of what we at
[1:31:08] trespect becomes clear to us it makes
[1:31:11] the journey easy for us to walk I tell
[1:31:14] you friends you wouldn't even need a
[1:31:16] pastor to be prodding you all the time
[1:31:18] you will give your all to him because
[1:31:21] you know at the end of the road you
[1:31:23] aren't going to exchange this Old Rugged
[1:31:25] life for nothing
[1:31:27] and that was why Christ said the reward
[1:31:30] is not going to be on earth alone so
[1:31:32] there's a reward on Earth yes yes for
[1:31:34] serving the lord let's do it Faithfully
[1:31:36] my brother let's do it Faithfully my
[1:31:38] sister be encouraged tonight amen yes
[1:31:42] I'm beyond time there's a greater reward
[1:31:44] up there that is what our lord said
[1:31:47] let's say the background from Peter
[1:31:48] sorry
[1:31:50] bring it for us and they came to pass
[1:31:52] let's enjoy this scripture
[1:31:55] and they came to pass
[1:31:57] that as the people pressed upon him
[1:32:00] that's upon the Lord to hear the word of
[1:32:03] God he stood by the lake of janessaret
[1:32:07] uh-huh
[1:32:08] and so to what
[1:32:10] two ships
[1:32:13] now he didn't say quinoa
[1:32:16] he didn't say a boat no no the Bible has
[1:32:19] used the word kennel in the scripture he
[1:32:21] has used boats in the scripture he's
[1:32:23] using sheep now
[1:32:25] so it's not playing with words it's the
[1:32:27] size of each equipment that determines
[1:32:30] their name
[1:32:32] now even if it's a kennel today can a
[1:32:36] poor manhole
[1:32:39] maybe some of you don't know what we
[1:32:40] call Kennels because you are the
[1:32:43] advanced country all right but at least
[1:32:45] you know both
[1:32:47] speed boats and everything you know that
[1:32:49] one yeah
[1:32:50] is it the proper can that be a property
[1:32:52] of a poor person
[1:32:54] you need some good money to buy a boat
[1:32:55] even if it's a small size isn't it yes
[1:32:58] all right we're going to see the owners
[1:33:00] of this ship now
[1:33:02] and ship is bigger than both both is
[1:33:05] bigger more sophisticated than kennels
[1:33:06] right
[1:33:10] boats are engine engine powered and ship
[1:33:14] is large size it could be a trawler it
[1:33:17] could be for containers depending on the
[1:33:19] size but at whatever level is not a
[1:33:21] property of a poor man how many agree
[1:33:24] with that all right so let's see the
[1:33:26] owners of these ones and we'll determine
[1:33:28] whether they are rich or poor and saw
[1:33:30] two ships standing by the lake but the
[1:33:33] fishermen we are going out of them and
[1:33:36] we are washing their nets all right
[1:33:38] and he entered into one of the ships
[1:33:41] which was ooze
[1:33:43] this is Simon Peter here now
[1:33:46] so Simon Peter had a ship
[1:33:50] he owned a ship was he a poor man
[1:33:54] God bless you so am I proving my case
[1:33:58] he owned a ship and anytime you travel
[1:34:01] to Israel
[1:34:02] uh tell your guide to take you to
[1:34:05] capanum
[1:34:06] and show you the evidence of Peter's
[1:34:09] house
[1:34:11] when they did archaeological excavation
[1:34:14] they brought out the old materials the
[1:34:17] materialization materials which which
[1:34:19] Peter built his house
[1:34:20] because the materials for your house
[1:34:23] determines your level of wealth in
[1:34:26] Israel they said if if the house is
[1:34:28] built with dark colored stones it shows
[1:34:31] you an average or poor person
[1:34:33] but if it's built with white granite
[1:34:36] Stones it shows you a wealthy man of
[1:34:38] standing at that time and when they
[1:34:41] excavated Peter's house the same place
[1:34:43] where Jesus healed the Mother-in-law in
[1:34:46] the Bible the other excavation remains
[1:34:49] shows white granite Stones so even the
[1:34:52] guide told us that Peter was a wealthy
[1:34:55] man yes this is the evidence
[1:34:58] so I'm giving you from archaeological
[1:35:00] point and I'm giving you from scriptural
[1:35:02] point
[1:35:05] and prayed him that he will trust out a
[1:35:08] little from the land
[1:35:09] and he sat down and taught the people
[1:35:12] out of the ship at this time Peter was
[1:35:15] not yet following Christ
[1:35:18] this was to be his conversion now
[1:35:20] followed
[1:35:22] let's go on
[1:35:25] the next line now when he had left
[1:35:28] speaking
[1:35:29] Peter was having a bad business day with
[1:35:32] his friends
[1:35:33] at this time
[1:35:35] they owned their ship
[1:35:37] they know what their ship should carry
[1:35:39] their Nets and so forth but this
[1:35:42] particular day they've done they've got
[1:35:44] nothing
[1:35:45] but in their frustration in their
[1:35:48] disappointment our Lord came around as
[1:35:51] if he never knew what has happened to
[1:35:52] them all day right
[1:35:56] but something connected with them
[1:35:58] because they have the siege Gem of God
[1:35:59] in their heart
[1:36:02] and somebody just came around he didn't
[1:36:04] know what you've been through all day I
[1:36:06] say can I use your
[1:36:08] can I just use your ship to do you say I
[1:36:11] don't need the entrance I just need the
[1:36:13] brain area I want to stand there and
[1:36:15] preach my gospel yeah if you are not
[1:36:18] careful you will miss your visitation
[1:36:19] yes right so what are you talking about
[1:36:21] do you know what what I've been through
[1:36:23] all day come on you must learn to rise
[1:36:26] above your frustration brother Brahm
[1:36:28] said Abraham was able to have a
[1:36:31] visitation of the Angel
[1:36:34] and you know give them a welcome because
[1:36:37] he rose above his situation
[1:36:40] Abraham was having family situation
[1:36:42] according to the reveal world
[1:36:45] that tells us truth hidden between the
[1:36:47] lines amen he was having a family
[1:36:50] situation he said you know the the
[1:36:52] frustrations and the disappointments of
[1:36:55] the day was taken to Allah we are sons
[1:36:58] of God here
[1:37:00] can I come for you a little amen
[1:37:03] was taken toll on Mama Sarah and she was
[1:37:07] kind of having it rough and venting it
[1:37:10] upon Abraham
[1:37:12] why was inventing this on Abraham
[1:37:14] Abraham made the most honorable
[1:37:16] Christian righteous choice
[1:37:19] but because the results were not coming
[1:37:21] as a result of that choice
[1:37:24] wasn't taking it easy it would be like
[1:37:27] look at you now
[1:37:28] you made Lord who he was you brought him
[1:37:32] out and when it comes to a time to make
[1:37:35] a choice you gave that young boy
[1:37:39] the rights to choose first he chose the
[1:37:41] nice place
[1:37:42] all the reports he's receiving is good
[1:37:45] business multiplying his expansion
[1:37:48] everything but you hear in the desert an
[1:37:51] old man with not enough
[1:37:55] maybe not enough signs to know what to
[1:37:58] do see what all the workers are saying
[1:38:01] they said it's all dry everything the
[1:38:03] cartoons are dying the businesses are
[1:38:05] not doing well because of your poor
[1:38:08] choice
[1:38:09] and Abraham was coming from a spiritual
[1:38:11] assemble you know mama I waited upon God
[1:38:14] to make the witch God did you wear up on
[1:38:17] and the prophet said when things were
[1:38:20] getting real tight Abraham said the best
[1:38:22] thing for me to do is to use a bypassity
[1:38:25] leader
[1:38:27] and they say you know what was happening
[1:38:28] it was the devil bringing his scarecrow
[1:38:31] to make him miss his visitation yes but
[1:38:35] Abram Rose above that by bypassing that
[1:38:40] and that is what sons of God must do
[1:38:47] he was the son of God enough
[1:38:49] to know how to retain the right
[1:38:51] atmosphere
[1:38:52] you must do that in your homes brother
[1:38:54] Brahma is a prophet listen to me with
[1:38:57] the Angelic visitation all the time is
[1:39:00] that sometimes I don't beat my house the
[1:39:02] way I left it
[1:39:04] right
[1:39:06] he said I come back into the house and
[1:39:09] everything looks upside down
[1:39:11] I would say once it affects the Earth it
[1:39:13] comes upon the children yes the prophet
[1:39:15] taught that he said because uh Mama
[1:39:19] media has been affected he said the
[1:39:21] children are also all over the places
[1:39:23] fighting crying doing all kind those
[1:39:25] things are not natural
[1:39:28] God wants the right atmospheres in our
[1:39:30] homes
[1:39:31] he said when I come in the first
[1:39:33] challenge I have as a Son of God is to
[1:39:36] check that Checkmate that invader
[1:39:40] ah you don't check mate and Invader with
[1:39:43] an instrument that is not in God's
[1:39:45] Armory
[1:39:46] he has the wisdom of the Son of God
[1:39:48] enough to know that the woman had come
[1:39:51] under intense pressure so she never
[1:39:54] attacked Mida he attacked the spirit
[1:39:59] even if you have to offer correction
[1:40:02] correction only thrives in the right
[1:40:05] atmosphere
[1:40:08] so he said I take the challenge to send
[1:40:11] the devil out
[1:40:12] then rescue my family
[1:40:15] then provide leadership
[1:40:17] so he said I'm madly able to boil water
[1:40:20] not to talk of cooking but I start doing
[1:40:22] things to bring back the smile yeah you
[1:40:25] tell me that I said ah how are you I
[1:40:29] said leave me alone there I don't have
[1:40:31] time for you
[1:40:33] and I said okay you know what I saw a
[1:40:36] dress right at the shop there I think it
[1:40:38] should be so nice that whatever cause
[1:40:40] let's go get it I don't need your dress
[1:40:44] I said okay what do I do he said I start
[1:40:47] getting the children wash them clean
[1:40:50] them up get to the kitchen try to tidy
[1:40:53] up things do they say when I'm doing
[1:40:55] that I'm looking at her face
[1:40:57] and gradually the smile is coming back
[1:41:00] is uh that makes me say no that makes
[1:41:03] you a Christian
[1:41:06] I'm not teaching you American lifestyle
[1:41:08] I'm teaching you Kingdom principles
[1:41:11] you must be first a child of God yes yes
[1:41:14] remember before in fact there is nothing
[1:41:17] good to learn about any country
[1:41:20] yeah all countries habits are
[1:41:22] substandard yeah to our own habit as
[1:41:25] Believers take it or leave it
[1:41:28] if you leave as an American you won't
[1:41:30] make it yeah you leave us in Nigeria you
[1:41:32] won't make it you leave us any Nation
[1:41:35] Under Heaven you won't make it right
[1:41:37] they don't have the quality or the
[1:41:39] standard of life that is required of a
[1:41:42] peculiar people a holy nation a royal
[1:41:45] priesthood they don't have it
[1:41:48] so shaker from this habit get into the
[1:41:51] habit of the world and you're going to
[1:41:53] live right
[1:41:55] is that by the time I'm doing that the
[1:41:57] devil is becoming uncomfortable I'm
[1:42:00] doing what I'm sending them out and the
[1:42:02] smile is beginning to return to my
[1:42:03] wife's face until you will say are you
[1:42:06] sure the shop will have closed can we go
[1:42:07] and get the clothes now right
[1:42:10] right then I know that I've checked that
[1:42:12] guy out if he's going to correct sister
[1:42:14] me there that correction will sink in at
[1:42:17] that time sons of God may he Grant you
[1:42:20] his wisdom
[1:42:21] to put the right atmosphere in your
[1:42:23] house
[1:42:25] so this Brethren Rose above their death
[1:42:29] frustration
[1:42:30] some of you maybe you have shops who
[1:42:32] have businesses you have to rise above
[1:42:35] it above your business to come to the
[1:42:37] house of the Lord tonight because
[1:42:38] sometimes the way the devil does is to
[1:42:41] bring more business right about the
[1:42:42] service time
[1:42:44] yeah we feel that in Africa
[1:42:46] you what you've said people have stayed
[1:42:49] all day in their shops nothing is
[1:42:51] selling right around coming to service
[1:42:53] time you'll be seeing volumes of traffic
[1:42:57] so you've got to rise above that or say
[1:43:00] look I must close this shop to go and
[1:43:02] mind my soul and let me tell you if you
[1:43:05] do that you've done honorable things
[1:43:07] you've placed the kingdom of God first
[1:43:09] nothing would you lose God will repay it
[1:43:13] back for you this was the condition of
[1:43:16] these folks here
[1:43:18] they've done no good business a day then
[1:43:20] somebody suddenly came as if he never
[1:43:22] knew
[1:43:23] say can I just use your so insensitive I
[1:43:26] need you know I don't need you in touch
[1:43:28] I just need this person I want to preach
[1:43:30] these guys must have look at himself it
[1:43:32] doesn't mean anything to us if it's not
[1:43:35] using it we are doing nothing if we use
[1:43:37] it it doesn't change anything Mr Man use
[1:43:40] and preach
[1:43:41] so after finishing the salmon please
[1:43:44] bring back my scripture
[1:43:46] amen amen are you enjoying the law
[1:43:49] what time do you closer
[1:43:52] oh no they don't want to be honest with
[1:43:54] me now
[1:43:55] all right I will go ahead until I feel
[1:43:58] uncomfortable
[1:44:00] thank you for thank you for your gesture
[1:44:02] now when he had left speaking is said
[1:44:06] unto Simon
[1:44:08] Jesus knows your cares friends amen it
[1:44:10] knows your sacrifices
[1:44:12] he knows just what it feels whether you
[1:44:16] pray unto him on Earth
[1:44:18] it knows your need can your faith rise
[1:44:21] up to a level tonight yes let me give
[1:44:23] you a scripture
[1:44:24] do you know what if you seek the kingdom
[1:44:26] of God first and it's righteousness
[1:44:29] whether you pray for your needs or not
[1:44:31] it is automatic
[1:44:34] that God must give you that's according
[1:44:36] to the scripture
[1:44:38] he said do not be anxious for nothing
[1:44:41] he said your heavenly fathers knows what
[1:44:44] you need it is the even that dies of
[1:44:48] anxiety
[1:44:49] but no child of God will be withhold
[1:44:52] anything good
[1:44:53] she faced the kingdom of God and his
[1:44:56] righteousness all other things am I
[1:45:00] cutting the scripture we be added to him
[1:45:03] so whether you pray for other things or
[1:45:06] not our lord said your heavenly father
[1:45:09] knows that you need those things
[1:45:14] come on George
[1:45:15] the one for whom they gave the right of
[1:45:18] way it's not going to respond
[1:45:21] it's a lounge out into the deep
[1:45:25] and let down your net for a drought
[1:45:29] if you look abroads the old meaning is
[1:45:32] an Old English word which means great
[1:45:35] multitude
[1:45:37] of others
[1:45:40] so in this case is going to be great
[1:45:43] multitude of fishes
[1:45:46] are you with me yes
[1:45:48] lunch into the deep and let down your
[1:45:51] net for what a draft let's hear the
[1:45:55] response
[1:45:58] and Simon answer and said unto him
[1:46:00] master
[1:46:01] we have towed all night
[1:46:04] and I've taken nothing
[1:46:06] as you see us we are not straight
[1:46:09] fishermen we are born fishermen right
[1:46:13] right train
[1:46:15] you understand we didn't Veer into this
[1:46:18] it's our life
[1:46:20] there's a difference between somebody
[1:46:22] who is naturally a fisherman and
[1:46:24] somebody who went to school just to be a
[1:46:26] fisherman we know when fishes are
[1:46:29] sleeping that's right we know when they
[1:46:30] are weak we know when they are playing
[1:46:32] we know when they annoyed we know when
[1:46:34] they're happy we have all the Dynamics
[1:46:36] and we can catch them
[1:46:38] and we've used all the skills we know
[1:46:41] from morning till now we caught nothing
[1:46:44] but there is something about you master
[1:46:47] nevertheless
[1:46:49] despite all this our experience
[1:46:51] as thy words
[1:46:56] so if they are relying on his words that
[1:46:59] means they are expecting to catch
[1:47:01] are you here
[1:47:04] because faith
[1:47:06] no expectation is aroused by faith
[1:47:10] and faith is provoked by a promise
[1:47:14] and the promise is accepted by your
[1:47:16] revelation of the ability of the one
[1:47:19] offering the promise
[1:47:22] let me make it simple if I tell our
[1:47:24] pastor here that I will buy you a tie
[1:47:29] and it looks like me and say yes he's
[1:47:31] able to do it will he not believe me
[1:47:34] he will believe me yeah do you
[1:47:35] understand this is the way to get Faith
[1:47:37] you must have the revelation of the
[1:47:40] ability of the one promising you
[1:47:43] if you believe that Christ can do all
[1:47:45] things it becomes easy for you to accept
[1:47:47] what he says
[1:47:49] that's how to build faith
[1:47:51] if maybe a little boy who doesn't have
[1:47:54] work maybe a five-year-old who doesn't
[1:47:57] do anything we'll come and tell pastor I
[1:47:58] will buy you a car
[1:48:01] did you catch that all of you are
[1:48:02] laughing
[1:48:04] you will find it difficult to believe
[1:48:06] because by your revelation of his
[1:48:09] ability he cannot do it
[1:48:11] is probably putting his parents Under
[1:48:13] Pressure now but by himself he cannot do
[1:48:16] it but if a man you know has the means
[1:48:19] say it is it's not difficult for you to
[1:48:21] accept and I'm telling you tonight Jesus
[1:48:24] has all the means foreign
[1:48:30] because even Peter trusted his word
[1:48:34] having just a fresh encounter with him
[1:48:37] and he said nevertheless other word I
[1:48:39] will let down the net
[1:48:41] and when he did I'm still not I'm not
[1:48:44] alive where I'm going but let's enjoy
[1:48:47] these are Sidelines seventh seal you
[1:48:49] know and when they had this done they
[1:48:52] enclosed I want you to underline that
[1:48:54] word
[1:48:55] the enclosed a great multitude of fishes
[1:48:59] what you enclose is what is not
[1:49:02] struggling scattering everywhere right
[1:49:04] because this is the way to enclose
[1:49:07] did you catch that
[1:49:09] you enclose it now you can only enclose
[1:49:12] what was waiting stationarily for you
[1:49:15] so meaning that even though there was no
[1:49:17] fish in the water
[1:49:19] the spoken word the creative word of God
[1:49:23] spoke fish in there and catch them there
[1:49:27] for these people to catch so they never
[1:49:30] struggle to catch these fishes and the
[1:49:33] Bible said fishes
[1:49:35] meaning because there's no plural
[1:49:37] for fish fish is fish even if they are
[1:49:41] one thousand but where you see a plural
[1:49:43] one like this it shows different species
[1:49:45] of fish
[1:49:47] so meaning this is not just tilapia this
[1:49:50] is not only heck this is not only
[1:49:52] Crocker this is not just catfish they
[1:49:55] write it
[1:49:58] by the creative power
[1:50:00] of him who spoke them into existence and
[1:50:03] they cut so big
[1:50:05] and their Nets break
[1:50:08] so this is the best business ever
[1:50:11] because it went beyond their capacity
[1:50:15] they've only they've always caught you
[1:50:18] know what their neck Nets could take but
[1:50:21] this time around God broke their neck
[1:50:24] so they made more fishes than they ever
[1:50:27] had in their life are you following not
[1:50:29] only that let's continue you will see
[1:50:31] where I'm going now and the beckoned
[1:50:34] onto their Partners which were in the
[1:50:36] order ship that there should come and
[1:50:39] help them and they came and filled both
[1:50:41] the ships
[1:50:43] yeah so that they began to sink
[1:50:48] this is God's business
[1:50:50] the blessings of the Lord that maketh
[1:50:52] rich and had no soul without any
[1:50:54] struggle without any labor just we're
[1:50:56] there to enclose
[1:50:58] and the god things that were more than
[1:51:01] their capacity business has never been
[1:51:04] this good for them
[1:51:07] all they have ever caught in their life
[1:51:09] is within the range of their sheep the
[1:51:11] size of their ship determines their cash
[1:51:13] but here our Lord came and said I will
[1:51:16] overrun your size I will exceed your
[1:51:18] expectation it's still the same
[1:51:20] yesterday today and forever when you
[1:51:23] begin to bless him first
[1:51:25] it's all pluses are no miners
[1:51:30] okay we are coming gradually to where
[1:51:32] I'm going
[1:51:33] all right when Simon Peter saw it he
[1:51:36] fell down at Jesus knees say depart from
[1:51:39] me for I'm a sinful man oh Lord it was
[1:51:42] to embarrass
[1:51:44] it's like saying that ah is this how you
[1:51:47] answer people's prayer even me I'm So
[1:51:50] Unworthy of this thing that you have
[1:51:52] done that's what Peter was expressing
[1:51:54] yeah isn't the Lord good to us
[1:51:58] let's watch
[1:52:00] the next line
[1:52:02] for it was astonished and all that were
[1:52:06] with him at the draft of the fishes
[1:52:08] which they had taken uh-huh go on
[1:52:12] and so also and so was also James we are
[1:52:16] seeing the identity of these Partners
[1:52:17] now and John the sons of zebedes they
[1:52:21] were first business partners before they
[1:52:23] become message partners
[1:52:25] because they were these same three guys
[1:52:28] that were going to get beautiful as they
[1:52:31] look on us
[1:52:32] are you catching it yeah so get good
[1:52:35] company
[1:52:36] and get it get companies that are
[1:52:38] positive that will be friends to Grace
[1:52:40] and not to disgrace mind your company
[1:52:43] mind your partnership amen
[1:52:47] all right which we are partners with
[1:52:49] Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not
[1:52:53] watch it now
[1:52:55] from End sports thou shall catch men
[1:52:59] and let's see the next line what it says
[1:53:02] and when they had brought their ships to
[1:53:05] land what happened
[1:53:07] what happened what happened
[1:53:10] they did watch
[1:53:13] they forsook those big catch those large
[1:53:17] Revenue
[1:53:18] I don't know who sold the fishes
[1:53:20] eventually I don't know we enjoy the
[1:53:22] money but they forsook all and followed
[1:53:26] him
[1:53:27] at the peak highest peak
[1:53:30] of their business success
[1:53:33] that was when Christ demanded
[1:53:35] come follow me
[1:53:38] so was Christ asking the Rich Young
[1:53:40] Ruler anything different from what he
[1:53:42] has always demanded no sir
[1:53:46] so if the Rich Young Ruler had accepted
[1:53:49] him he would just have done his
[1:53:50] reasonable service
[1:53:52] he wouldn't have made much more
[1:53:54] sacrifice than others
[1:53:56] because at the greatest level of money
[1:54:00] Christ demanded for followership Peter
[1:54:03] James and John left everything
[1:54:07] and they followed him this was the
[1:54:10] backgrounds to their question in Luke
[1:54:11] 18.
[1:54:13] Lord's Master we have forsaken all this
[1:54:17] guy refused to forsake all
[1:54:20] he still has everything we have forsaken
[1:54:23] all we don't even mind our business
[1:54:25] again if you have a place to sleep we
[1:54:28] sleep if we don't have a place to sleep
[1:54:30] we just keep going with you
[1:54:32] for all the sacrifices that we have made
[1:54:34] what is going to be in there for us
[1:54:38] so that question was touchy to our Lord
[1:54:41] because he knew the background to it and
[1:54:44] that was why I said Peter I understand
[1:54:47] nobody ever forsake anything for me
[1:54:51] or for my namesake that will not get
[1:54:54] much more in this life or in the world
[1:54:57] to come I'm saying it affirmatively that
[1:55:00] Christianity must have something in it
[1:55:02] for us
[1:55:04] so be encouraged tonight
[1:55:07] you aren't going to exchange these old
[1:55:10] self-denial life with nothing
[1:55:14] God came to Matthew
[1:55:15] was a career a career officer
[1:55:18] professional
[1:55:20] he take taxes he records it it makes
[1:55:24] money for the government and everything
[1:55:26] Christ got on the queue one day
[1:55:29] seemingly looking like it was coming to
[1:55:31] pay his tax and they waited for his own
[1:55:34] town
[1:55:35] when the sun came
[1:55:37] Matthew must affects how much are you
[1:55:39] paying what's your Revenue let me
[1:55:40] calculate your taxes and you just look
[1:55:42] at you and say Matthew
[1:55:44] said
[1:55:45] sir
[1:55:47] gather from there and follow me
[1:55:49] a Matthew left all the money all the
[1:55:52] booklets all the records his career his
[1:55:56] gratuity his pension Everything plan he
[1:55:59] left or right there I'm for soup and
[1:56:02] followed Christ
[1:56:04] so if such people demanded of Christ
[1:56:07] what is going to be in it for us you
[1:56:09] think he will rebuke them he knew that
[1:56:11] they needed an uncle
[1:56:15] so if you need an uncle tonight God will
[1:56:17] give it to you
[1:56:19] and maybe this is the uncle you need
[1:56:21] tonight
[1:56:22] if you are in a state of despair if
[1:56:24] you're in a state of confusion whether
[1:56:26] look let me tell you keep pressing on
[1:56:28] yes
[1:56:29] if you only knew what lays ahead
[1:56:32] oh God bless yourself
[1:56:35] what am I proven
[1:56:37] Christianity thank you Christianity is
[1:56:41] based on expectation
[1:56:44] and we trust the one
[1:56:46] who has promised us amen he said he will
[1:56:50] never leave us he will never forsake us
[1:56:53] is there nothing you ever forsake for
[1:56:55] him in time
[1:56:57] will that God will never forget so
[1:57:01] Brethren a lord lays ahead do not allow
[1:57:04] the glamor of the world
[1:57:06] to do your senses
[1:57:08] to the beauty of Heaven amen can we go a
[1:57:12] little bit more
[1:57:14] is it okay to go a little bit more film
[1:57:16] okay if it's okay then let me come back
[1:57:19] to the scripture the second scripture
[1:57:20] quickly
[1:57:23] God gave her
[1:57:26] the second the second rule for that
[1:57:28] scripture is that the prophet said you
[1:57:31] must also have the revelation of what
[1:57:33] you are expecting
[1:57:37] because sometimes you know the people
[1:57:39] who were expecting the Messiah
[1:57:42] new deer will be a messiah
[1:57:44] but they never had the revelation of how
[1:57:47] the Messiah will come yeah
[1:57:51] in the message Discerning the body of
[1:57:53] the Lord I took one line very seriously
[1:57:57] he said our Eternal destination
[1:58:00] does not depend
[1:58:03] s
[1:58:04] on what we see
[1:58:07] what we hear even what we as preachers
[1:58:10] preach
[1:58:12] listen to me he said it's entirely
[1:58:15] dependent on the discernment
[1:58:18] the revelation we have of what we are
[1:58:21] seeing
[1:58:23] hearing
[1:58:24] and even preaching yeah you say is it
[1:58:27] possible to preach a thing without
[1:58:29] revelation
[1:58:30] absolutely yeah and I'll prove it to you
[1:58:33] tonight
[1:58:35] they call me Messiah was a sermon that
[1:58:38] started gaining prominence since the day
[1:58:41] of prophet Isaiah do you remember that a
[1:58:44] virgin shall conceive
[1:58:47] but do you know people do not have the
[1:58:49] revelation of the conception of a virgin
[1:58:52] there we are thinking that a virgin will
[1:58:55] be married a virgin
[1:58:56] but for how to conceive and bring forth
[1:58:58] a child she can no longer be a virgin
[1:59:02] she must be known to bring forth their
[1:59:05] child is that right
[1:59:07] but that's not the revelation of the
[1:59:09] words
[1:59:10] this version will not be known he will
[1:59:14] remain a virgin after conception he will
[1:59:17] remain a virgin after delivery she will
[1:59:20] still be a virgin
[1:59:22] yeah
[1:59:23] because she will still be Untouched by
[1:59:25] anybody
[1:59:27] that is the revelation
[1:59:29] but nobody knew that
[1:59:31] that was why when Angel Gabriel came
[1:59:34] down
[1:59:34] Mary who had long been the church
[1:59:37] and the Angels sing with her out and
[1:59:39] told her you are going to have he said
[1:59:41] how will these things be knowing that I
[1:59:43] know no man
[1:59:46] and to I was given the revelation of the
[1:59:49] plan the spirit of the Lord will
[1:59:51] overshadow you and this and that she
[1:59:54] adds that revelation
[1:59:56] but the reason these things was rejected
[2:00:00] in the church was because even the
[2:00:02] preacher did not have that revelation
[2:00:06] a virgin shall conceive use young ladies
[2:00:09] keep yourself who knows whether it's
[2:00:11] going to be among you and they were
[2:00:12] keeping themselves and one of those who
[2:00:15] was keeping themselves eventually
[2:00:16] conceived and they said no no no no no
[2:00:19] tell it to somebody else how can you say
[2:00:22] you conceive how can you say
[2:00:24] the preachers rejected us that's right
[2:00:27] rejecting their own Sermon Just the Same
[2:00:30] that's right but there was somebody whom
[2:00:32] God gave a revelation mom now you will
[2:00:36] not see death until you see the Lost
[2:00:38] Christ
[2:00:41] now I didn't know how God brought this
[2:00:44] promise to him
[2:00:45] but I have an idea of the way God does
[2:00:48] these things it might be that Simeon
[2:00:50] preached so much
[2:00:53] about the Messiah
[2:00:55] until God was impressed
[2:00:58] and excited about the sermon and say and
[2:01:00] you will have you will see the Messiah
[2:01:02] it may be so because when brother Brown
[2:01:05] preached about Joseph so much
[2:01:07] God looked at him one day and said you
[2:01:09] will have a Joseph amen I can say your
[2:01:12] passion on the delivery of Joseph in
[2:01:14] comparison to the Lord and it's it gets
[2:01:17] even with the Lord he said you have it
[2:01:18] yourself so maybe it is one of such
[2:01:22] but anyhow that man held tight
[2:01:27] to the promise
[2:01:28] I will not see death until I say the
[2:01:31] Lord's Christ and daily he was expecting
[2:01:34] daily he was preaching and let me tell
[2:01:37] you that expectation preserved Simeon
[2:01:40] yeah
[2:01:42] it was an old man so even if he was
[2:01:45] suffering from old age sicknesses no
[2:01:47] matter how profit God right he knew we
[2:01:50] never die I can imagine it will have
[2:01:52] been in ICU for many days sometimes
[2:01:54] blocked every life supports and
[2:01:56] everything and when they rebounded
[2:01:58] leader he said Doctor don't disturb
[2:02:00] yourself you know I can die
[2:02:02] that's right and the doctor always said
[2:02:04] the man is getting hysteric let's give
[2:02:07] him some shots to calm his nerves he
[2:02:09] said save yourself the trouble I have a
[2:02:11] promise
[2:02:13] until I see the Lost Christ
[2:02:16] let me tell you if you want to touch to
[2:02:18] a promise for your life it will preserve
[2:02:21] you
[2:02:23] the promise God gave Caleb preserved
[2:02:25] Caleb
[2:02:26] it's not that you won't get hurt listen
[2:02:29] to me but you wound up you will not be
[2:02:31] in a ship not to enjoy your promise
[2:02:34] Caleb was 85 years old when the promise
[2:02:37] of God was about to be fulfilled in his
[2:02:40] life but what was his testimony he said
[2:02:42] as my strength was at age 40 so is my
[2:02:46] strength now so age means nothing to
[2:02:49] carry off promises because your promise
[2:02:52] must preserve you and keep you in a
[2:02:54] condition to enjoy
[2:03:00] that is the power of expectation
[2:03:03] so you could imagine this day came when
[2:03:06] the Lord was going to fulfill it and you
[2:03:09] know what
[2:03:10] some people came
[2:03:12] you know for baby dedication
[2:03:14] and Joseph and Mary also came the moment
[2:03:18] they saw Joseph America now our own
[2:03:20] children are pedigree children these are
[2:03:22] the legislature child so we can't be on
[2:03:25] the same side so they must have gone
[2:03:27] this way leaving Joseph and Mary this
[2:03:29] way and Pastor Simeon came to the pulpit
[2:03:32] and said they told me today we're going
[2:03:34] to have some baby dedication
[2:03:35] so while they sing bring them and bring
[2:03:37] them in let's have the babies to be
[2:03:39] dedicated
[2:03:40] and as they were doing that
[2:03:43] something was
[2:03:45] connecting to that side
[2:03:49] these are this this is the side where
[2:03:50] people are what am I to do here then as
[2:03:54] a marriage to go the deacons came and
[2:03:55] said excuse me pastor this way
[2:04:00] but God is saying this way
[2:04:03] let me go the way of God first and I
[2:04:06] will come back this way I say move
[2:04:08] closer to that baby the Deep was called
[2:04:10] into the day
[2:04:11] and the moment it took a glance the
[2:04:13] Revelation became clear
[2:04:15] yeah
[2:04:16] say I've seen the Lost Christ
[2:04:18] now I can depart in peace
[2:04:21] what have what God has had my life for
[2:04:24] has now come to pass I can go now what
[2:04:28] happened God gave God opened his eyes
[2:04:31] despite all the criticism
[2:04:34] to see the expectation come to pass
[2:04:38] right
[2:04:39] the promise of God we also preserve your
[2:04:42] life
[2:04:43] you must have the revelation of the one
[2:04:45] who promised as long as you hold that
[2:04:48] very tight amen it will it will make
[2:04:51] your faith consistent yes let me close
[2:04:54] it by this
[2:04:56] no matter how weak your expectation is
[2:05:00] hold it very tight
[2:05:04] because let me say this what God on us
[2:05:07] is not the quality of your expectation
[2:05:09] underline it
[2:05:11] is the quality of your faith yeah
[2:05:15] because you cannot expect as I said a
[2:05:18] while ago without having faith
[2:05:20] and faith is strengthened by the
[2:05:23] revelation of who made the promise
[2:05:27] I will buy you a Thai pastor
[2:05:30] you believe it because you believe I can
[2:05:33] afford the time
[2:05:35] so anytime you see me you remember the
[2:05:38] promise and you look forward to its
[2:05:41] fulfillment yeah when you even feel I'm
[2:05:43] delaying you can use some style to
[2:05:46] remind me yeah
[2:05:48] my brother do you remember and I would
[2:05:52] say I remember
[2:05:53] right the tie is on his way I've
[2:05:56] actually ordered it I wanted to be a
[2:05:58] sick one that's why
[2:06:00] you believe it because you know my
[2:06:03] ability yes
[2:06:05] yes and I'm saying tonight when you know
[2:06:08] the one who had spoken
[2:06:10] it becomes easy for you to accept the
[2:06:13] promise and when you accept the promise
[2:06:16] you'll be expecting the Fulfillment
[2:06:18] so first as a connection with
[2:06:20] expectation it is that faith
[2:06:23] that God honors not necessarily the
[2:06:26] quality of your expectation if I say
[2:06:30] time
[2:06:31] the person might just be expecting just
[2:06:33] any time
[2:06:34] do you understand but me that promise
[2:06:37] so now only a sick one is good for the
[2:06:40] pastor
[2:06:41] then when I bring it I wasn't expecting
[2:06:44] something this much oh to me this is
[2:06:46] what you deserve right that is the way
[2:06:48] God does these things
[2:06:50] so the quality of the expectation will
[2:06:53] not short Change
[2:06:55] the result
[2:06:56] God will still give it to you as he
[2:06:59] wanted it yes let me prove that to you
[2:07:01] as I went down
[2:07:03] lemon
[2:07:05] traveled all the way to Syria from Syria
[2:07:09] to Israel because she believed
[2:07:13] he believed in the testimony of a small
[2:07:17] girl
[2:07:18] the Bible call her a damn self damn self
[2:07:22] relatively is a young girl by
[2:07:24] interpretation
[2:07:26] now this is for you my young friends
[2:07:29] this damn cell was an Israelite
[2:07:33] but she found herself in Syria not by a
[2:07:36] choice
[2:07:38] she was a captive of War
[2:07:40] but no matter how emergent or how
[2:07:44] desperate or how quick how sudden
[2:07:47] I capture was one thing she never felt
[2:07:50] to go with was the god of Israel
[2:07:52] if that God was still like this for Auto
[2:07:56] Park she might have missed it but that
[2:07:59] God was already in her
[2:08:02] life the reason we are coming for these
[2:08:04] services
[2:08:05] is not for us to have a distant
[2:08:07] relationship with a book called Bible
[2:08:10] is for that Bible to come into us
[2:08:13] and we become the Bible and the Bible
[2:08:15] become us that is the Fulfillment of our
[2:08:18] joy listen to me George we are coming to
[2:08:21] learn the presence of the son to have
[2:08:24] all the greenness of our life baked
[2:08:26] until we become bread of life on the
[2:08:29] Lord's table for us to eat amen these
[2:08:32] Messengers must become their message
[2:08:34] let us know waste our season
[2:08:37] let's not be slothful let's not be
[2:08:40] sluggish let us eat and accumulate we
[2:08:44] must become our food
[2:08:47] you are what you are eating
[2:08:49] that is what they said if you eat
[2:08:50] balanced diet your growth will reflect
[2:08:53] balanced diet because after you eat it
[2:08:56] goes into your belief for digestion
[2:08:58] after digestion comes absorption once
[2:09:01] it's absorbed it influences your stature
[2:09:04] isn't it yes is that not correct Mama
[2:09:06] uh-huh
[2:09:08] so you are what you are eating if you
[2:09:11] are eating the word of the Lord you
[2:09:12] become the word of the Lord
[2:09:15] are you catching it you must become my
[2:09:18] brother you must become my sister
[2:09:20] because that is the only way to survive
[2:09:22] the pressure and the school is it is not
[2:09:25] a book in your hands that will give you
[2:09:27] Survivor it is not even Fellowship like
[2:09:30] this because fellowshiping like this
[2:09:32] will become for memories
[2:09:34] amen yes maybe through here maybe one
[2:09:37] day maybe just all alone
[2:09:39] like this young lady was all alone
[2:09:42] but that which you have become will give
[2:09:45] you Survivor a time of emergency is
[2:09:47] going to come upon the head and you
[2:09:49] might not even be able to pack all the
[2:09:51] books whether on your phone on your
[2:09:53] tablet or even in the physical form but
[2:09:55] the much that has been you will give you
[2:09:57] Survivor at that time so while we have
[2:10:00] the opportunity let's be eaten
[2:10:03] and be gluttonous
[2:10:05] George I say be what gluttonous about
[2:10:09] don't be gluttonous about burger right
[2:10:11] because it could give you side effects
[2:10:13] but there's a food that has no side
[2:10:15] effects that's the message of the hour
[2:10:17] spiritual food induces it every content
[2:10:21] is digestible and absorbable
[2:10:25] praise the Lord this is why the prophet
[2:10:27] said taking everything because we are
[2:10:29] going to need every bit of it in the
[2:10:31] days that lay ahead so this girl
[2:10:35] parked without the god of Israel
[2:10:38] and a life was different
[2:10:42] that was why when she got up to give a
[2:10:44] testimony she never preached all she
[2:10:47] said was that all this problem General
[2:10:49] has
[2:10:50] if he could only go to Israel
[2:10:53] does the prophet of God in there all the
[2:10:55] problem will be over
[2:10:57] and she said it with the sense of
[2:10:59] responsibility
[2:11:01] not mind the weather it could happen or
[2:11:03] not at the risk of our integrity and our
[2:11:06] life
[2:11:07] give a testimony amen and guess what all
[2:11:11] the entire Syria
[2:11:13] went to work by our testimony she was a
[2:11:17] powerful generational influencer
[2:11:20] those are the kind of people you should
[2:11:22] emulate
[2:11:24] all those social media Hellbound
[2:11:26] influencers
[2:11:27] that will teach you bad songs Bad
[2:11:29] Manners bad vulgar dressing and all
[2:11:31] kinds of things they are not watch it
[2:11:33] for you you are not a low life
[2:11:36] don't live inferior to them right are
[2:11:39] you with me so go put your phones of
[2:11:43] dirty nonsense I call them nonsense
[2:11:46] Dirty music Let Me Tell You music can
[2:11:50] cast out demons and music can bring in
[2:11:53] demons
[2:11:55] if you could cast it out for David for
[2:11:57] Saul
[2:11:58] he could bring it in
[2:12:01] I've seen people listen to music I was
[2:12:04] in South America Guyana
[2:12:06] one time when a young fellow shot
[2:12:09] another guy and what was he listening to
[2:12:12] it was listed I've forgotten the day did
[2:12:14] they call it Puff Daddy or something one
[2:12:16] name like that he said if anybody makes
[2:12:18] a pass at your girlfriend shot in Get
[2:12:20] Him shot
[2:12:22] that was the song and this guy listened
[2:12:24] to this song he said it was a national
[2:12:25] concern in Guyana that particular year
[2:12:28] maybe 2016. he said I listen to that
[2:12:31] music and that's what this guy was doing
[2:12:33] and I got him shot
[2:12:34] is that it
[2:12:37] so something this the music anointed him
[2:12:41] parting with the demons to actualize so
[2:12:45] look whatever you are lending your ears
[2:12:48] to
[2:12:48] has the capacity to influence you I wish
[2:12:52] I could preach on influence brother
[2:12:53] Brown said things people do we are
[2:12:56] inspired by enticing spirits and he said
[2:12:59] nobody lives the life of isolation you
[2:13:01] are either been influenced from above or
[2:13:03] from Beneath Your influences goes beyond
[2:13:06] physical they are spiritual levels to
[2:13:08] our influence
[2:13:10] this is why we must keep ourselves from
[2:13:13] those dirty nonsense
[2:13:16] are you with me Brethren I hope it's not
[2:13:18] too tight God bless you and if it is God
[2:13:21] bless you too it's for deliverance
[2:13:24] you love him
[2:13:26] so this is small girl give a testimony
[2:13:29] and the reason they took us serious was
[2:13:31] because they knew there was a life
[2:13:35] there was something different about and
[2:13:37] she was not just like any other Syrian
[2:13:39] oh be like that my brother
[2:13:42] let your moderation be known to all men
[2:13:44] wherever you are let your banner be
[2:13:47] clear
[2:13:49] so
[2:13:51] the all of Syria came to Israel by the
[2:13:54] testimony of a small girl not even the
[2:13:56] sermon of a Preacher
[2:13:58] they sent him to the king the king in
[2:14:01] Israel had no Revelation like the girl
[2:14:03] because the girl sent to the prophet but
[2:14:05] you know government thing they have to
[2:14:07] go to the king so that they don't look
[2:14:09] like a spy but eventually it got to the
[2:14:12] prophet
[2:14:13] but this is where I'm going when neyman
[2:14:16] was coming to the prophet Nema was like
[2:14:18] a Pentecostal guy
[2:14:19] who had his own expectation of how his
[2:14:22] healing should take place
[2:14:25] according to the scripture right maybe
[2:14:27] it would be like he was expecting some
[2:14:29] gymnastics right and some ruling in the
[2:14:31] spirit and some turning you know we have
[2:14:33] preachers today we'll be using finger to
[2:14:35] control people do like this the man will
[2:14:38] run like this run like this when it does
[2:14:40] like this the man will fall far he said
[2:14:42] that's powerful anointing and everybody
[2:14:44] will be jumping he was expecting
[2:14:46] something like that
[2:14:47] what a prophet never even came out
[2:14:50] he said go watch at the pool of uh is it
[2:14:53] Jordan
[2:14:54] yeah and you'll be fine
[2:14:56] and the man said I thought you would
[2:14:58] come out
[2:14:59] and do something
[2:15:01] that was the quality of his expectation
[2:15:04] but God was determined to honor his
[2:15:06] faith yes right because he couldn't have
[2:15:09] found himself in Israel
[2:15:11] is that right if he did not believe the
[2:15:14] testimony of that girl so whichever way
[2:15:16] whichever way was expecting was not an
[2:15:19] issue to God right it was the FED behind
[2:15:22] it that he recognized that's right then
[2:15:24] the servant said look if the man of God
[2:15:26] told us to do something much more
[2:15:27] terrible in your estimation than this
[2:15:29] won't you do it or you don't want to be
[2:15:31] free from General neyman PSS FSS mni DDD
[2:15:35] bought a leper
[2:15:39] so you make sense sometimes let's go
[2:15:42] and they go to the water he was
[2:15:44] expecting after the first deep small
[2:15:46] small changes and the servant said seven
[2:15:49] times
[2:15:50] continue
[2:15:51] he did until since no change he said the
[2:15:54] man of God said seven right
[2:15:56] when it dipped the seven times which all
[2:15:59] is the complexes and everything God
[2:16:02] healed him anyhow
[2:16:04] so it is not the quality of your
[2:16:07] expectation it will shortchange you it
[2:16:09] is the quality of your faith
[2:16:13] last line
[2:16:16] the lame and they get beautiful yeah do
[2:16:18] you remember him yeah
[2:16:21] when he saw Peter James and John these
[2:16:23] three Partners again
[2:16:24] when he saw them coming
[2:16:26] he was expecting that he looked at them
[2:16:28] with the way they addressed this one
[2:16:30] should be able to offer ten dollars
[2:16:34] maybe this one
[2:16:36] five dollars but I think this one will
[2:16:38] do 2015 or 20. so collectively I should
[2:16:42] be able to be doing 30 and 40 dollars
[2:16:44] from this guy that was the quality of
[2:16:46] his expectation right
[2:16:48] just something for the nest meal Nest
[2:16:51] relief yeah but here was God ready to
[2:16:55] give a permanent solution
[2:16:57] did you catch that yeah and it was still
[2:17:00] not short change him he will still not
[2:17:02] reduce the blessing to the level of what
[2:17:04] he was expecting because it is not the
[2:17:06] quality of the expectation it is the
[2:17:08] quality of the faith
[2:17:11] did you catch that you cannot expect
[2:17:13] without having faith yes
[2:17:16] and when those guys came he must have
[2:17:17] been disappointed
[2:17:19] he said look at us even go we don't have
[2:17:21] so with your shirts suits tie everything
[2:17:23] looking sharp and neat you don't have
[2:17:26] even a dollar is that what you are
[2:17:28] saying you don't deserve to live in
[2:17:30] Minneapolis go to your village my friend
[2:17:32] right
[2:17:34] but he didn't do that it was just
[2:17:36] dumbfounded
[2:17:38] and they told him you might want the
[2:17:40] dollar or something but what we have
[2:17:44] you won the temporary relief but we've
[2:17:47] got a permanent solution
[2:17:51] so it wasn't short thing still right
[2:17:53] because he could believe yeah
[2:17:55] in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[2:17:59] walk however weak or strong your
[2:18:01] expectation it hold it very tight yeah
[2:18:05] it will help you it will motivate you it
[2:18:08] will keep you consistent it will keep
[2:18:10] your testimony intact and may the Lord
[2:18:13] bless you
[2:18:14] Shalom to the bride of Christ
[2:18:17] [Applause]
[2:18:23] God bless you sir
[2:18:37] amen

[2:18:41] them
