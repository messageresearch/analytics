[39:04] wonderful we pray that the Lord will
[39:06] Deliver Us from every romance and let

[39:11] praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you
[39:14] and Lord bless you you may have your
[39:16] seat a little bit before we uh change
[39:18] the order of the service here praise the
[39:22] Lord let just take uh uh Luke chapter 1
[39:27] and I we share something with you and
[39:29] then we call up the preacher for the
[39:31] night brother Samuel our friend from uh
[39:34] Uganda will be will be sharing with us
[39:37] tonight praise the Lord
[39:41] amen praise the
[39:43] Lord
[39:45] hallelujah you love the Lord Luke
[39:48] chapter 1 we will read from verse
[39:53] one Luke chapter 1 we will read from
[39:56] verse one
[40:01] on praise the
[40:04] Lord amen for as much as many have taken
[40:09] in hand to set forth in other a
[40:12] declaration of those things which are
[40:15] most surely
[40:18] believe among
[40:22] us even as they delivered them unto us
[40:26] which were word I mean which from the
[40:29] beginning were
[40:31] eyewitnesses and minister of the word
[40:34] now so this is luk bringing his own
[40:37] report now you have to remember that
[40:39] Luke was not among the
[40:41] disciples he was not among Jesus
[40:44] disciples uh Luke came uh uh somewhere
[40:48] along the line and uh he's trying to
[40:52] bring his own report now he's trying to
[40:54] tell us that he got his report from from
[40:58] eyewitnesses and people that were
[41:00] Ministers of the word which of course is
[41:03] uh uh you know the disciples and and and
[41:07] and many of you you read the book of
[41:08] Acts you will see how Luke came along
[41:11] and then he started to support Paul in
[41:14] his missionary work so let's go ahead
[41:16] and read a little bit here he says verse
[41:18] two again even as they deliver unto us
[41:22] which from the beginning were ey
[41:24] Witnesses and Ministers of the word it
[41:26] seemed good to mean also having her
[41:29] perfect understanding of all things from
[41:33] the very first now so Luke was more like
[41:37] an
[41:39] investigator everything he heard he went
[41:43] back and started sessioning it out so
[41:46] you will realize that in Luke gospel
[41:49] there are some information that you will
[41:52] not find in the rest of the other
[41:54] gospel praise the Lord amen because
[41:57] remember he's a
[41:59] physician and a physician is a man that
[42:02] is of
[42:03] details when you sit down with your your
[42:06] your doctor he want
[42:08] details how did this
[42:10] happen when did it
[42:12] happen what you think might have led to
[42:15] this praise the
[42:18] Lord it seemed good to me also having
[42:21] had perfect understanding of all things
[42:23] from the very first to right onto the
[42:27] in
[42:29] order most excellent
[42:33] theop praise the Lord are we together
[42:37] praise the Lord now uh uh I was looking
[42:40] a little bit in the Book of Luke today
[42:42] you you can tell there and uh
[42:46] uh uh share something to with you before
[42:50] the the preacher comes and uh you know
[42:54] uh uh I follow of the service on Sunday
[42:57] and I and uh I really enjoyed the the
[43:00] the presence of the Lord the way you
[43:02] were receiving the word the way the word
[43:03] was preached and I think that it was
[43:06] such a blessing amen and we want to
[43:08] thank the Lord we pray that God continue
[43:10] to help our brother brother ariam and I
[43:13] think uh uh it is our responsibility to
[43:16] be able to encourage one another in the
[43:18] Lord and and uh and you know and and
[43:21] then uh he called me and uh you know
[43:24] taught to come and pick me up from the
[43:26] airport I knew why he did he wanted to
[43:28] know whether I listened to the
[43:30] service and he wanted to know if if uh
[43:34] if there is anything he needs to check
[43:36] with me
[43:37] about so as we drove from the airport we
[43:40] talked on different things and uh I
[43:43] appreciate him for the service and I
[43:45] thought well okay I think I have one on
[43:47] him and I should be able to get on him
[43:49] quickly now so uh uh uh you know uh uh
[43:54] in in the beginning the reading reading
[43:56] uh of the two uh disciples on the road
[43:59] of EMAs the Bible gave us the name of
[44:02] one
[44:04] cus and uh uh uh actually if you look in
[44:08] the message if you do research you will
[44:10] find places where brother brandham used
[44:13] the name he said theopus in he friend
[44:17] there are few places where he said
[44:18] theopus in he friend you know but if you
[44:24] look at the context of what he was
[44:25] saying I think he to say clear
[44:30] pass
[44:32] because unless there was another
[44:34] Theophilus the Theophilus that is
[44:37] recorded here to us was a Roman
[44:40] soldier that became a
[44:43] Believer and theopus Luke wrote this
[44:47] book to be able to present it to theil
[44:51] to convince
[44:53] him that you know this thing about the
[44:56] Lord Jesus is
[44:59] truth so it could not be that Theophilus
[45:02] that was on the road of
[45:04] EMAs because if not Luke will not be
[45:09] writing to Theophilus about Theophilus
[45:12] you see the you see where I'm going okay
[45:15] he will not be writing to Theophilus
[45:17] about Theophilus so both the Book of
[45:20] Luke in the book of Acts which of course
[45:23] is a continuation of Luke report he he
[45:27] he uh wrote there to to tus and you know
[45:31] that's the way that God does he raised
[45:33] up you know men of of great intelligence
[45:36] to be able to reach out to Men of great
[45:39] intelligence you see so if God bless you
[45:41] and put you in a place is for you to
[45:43] reach out to the people that are in that
[45:45] place so Luke had the education he had
[45:49] the background to be able to speak to
[45:52] Men of higher authority and that's what
[45:54] he was trying to do so if you actually
[45:57] look it up you will see brother bam says
[45:59] theopus and his friend there's not a
[46:01] quote where he said theopus and uh
[46:05] cleas no there's not a court so we
[46:08] cannot
[46:09] assume that theophilos was the one
[46:13] walking with clear pass on the road we
[46:16] don't have no authority to do that you
[46:19] know so brother B tells us we must not
[46:22] presum without Authority because the
[46:24] reason why he says that because if you
[46:26] you say something that is not word based
[46:29] the Holy Ghost can back it up you're on
[46:32] your
[46:34] own praise the Lord amen so uh uh we
[46:38] Fellowship a little bit on that because
[46:40] uh I I saw that you know uh and it just
[46:44] come from a place where you know there
[46:47] is that little sense of curiosity in US
[46:49] wanting to know who was this guy who was
[46:53] this other guy that was walking with
[46:55] cleers that is not men
[46:58] praise the Lord you want to know who is
[47:01] that
[47:02] person you want to know who is that
[47:05] person will that feel your
[47:08] curiosity let's make it in the
[47:12] Rapture amen let's make it in the
[47:17] Rapture praise the Lord I'm not going to
[47:20] bring a rabbit out of the heart I'm not
[47:22] a magician I'm a preacher and as a
[47:25] preacher I must tell you the truth if
[47:27] you want to know who is that person
[47:28] let's make it in rapture we will see him
[47:31] there amen amen the Lord bless you
[47:33] tonight let's stand on our feet and we
[47:34] call the preacher of the night

[1:00:08] to by the leadership of the Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit uh to speak on a greater than
[1:00:16] Solomon is
[1:00:18] here
[1:00:20] amen and my
[1:00:23] inspiration Lord Grant unto me the
[1:00:28] desire of my
[1:00:30] heart amen amen Lord grant unto me the
[1:00:36] desire of my heart and I believe tonight
[1:00:40] you also have a
[1:00:43] desire and that's why today we have a
[1:00:47] prayer
[1:00:48] meeting and in fact you know I always
[1:00:51] tell people when many times when you go
[1:00:54] for prayer meetings people even don't
[1:00:56] have what to pray about right they just
[1:00:59] come because it's a prayer meeting but
[1:01:02] they don't have any desire they don't
[1:01:04] have any burden they don't have any need
[1:01:07] but we thank God that uh we have needs
[1:01:11] and we have desires and every time when
[1:01:14] there is a prayer meeting like this we
[1:01:17] should be coming with
[1:01:19] burdens with needs with
[1:01:22] requests to present them before the
[1:01:25] Lorden
[1:01:27] amen yeah so we believe
[1:01:30] that every every need and every
[1:01:35] desire that we
[1:01:37] have God is more than able yes to
[1:01:42] provide amen because God keeps his word
[1:01:48] yes is that right yes and he
[1:01:52] fulfills all his promises
[1:01:56] amen amen when God speaks something and
[1:02:00] when God promises something we believe
[1:02:04] that his duty bound to fulfill it
[1:02:09] amen amen that's why he says ask and
[1:02:12] shall be
[1:02:13] given knock and they shall open for you
[1:02:17] seek and it shall find amen so when we
[1:02:21] come to God we believe that every
[1:02:24] promise in the Bible
[1:02:27] amen he must give
[1:02:30] us amen and by faith we receive
[1:02:36] them because every promise in the Bible
[1:02:40] is
[1:02:41] mine
[1:02:43] amen amen so we have a right as a
[1:02:47] children of God to claim for every
[1:02:51] promise because we are hairs to every
[1:02:55] promise of God amen
[1:02:57] amen uh I I love what brother brah says
[1:03:01] here uh we shall just go
[1:03:04] quickly in the
[1:03:07] message
[1:03:10] God keeps his
[1:03:22] word
[1:03:23] amen uh that was pre in
[1:03:30] 58 03 that was maybe March
[1:03:39] 28th and paragraph
[1:03:45] 12 he says
[1:03:48] here
[1:03:51] uh there is one thing that we can surely
[1:03:54] rest upon
[1:03:56] that is that God keeps everyone of his
[1:04:01] words he watches over them day and night
[1:04:06] to perform them and every promise that
[1:04:10] he made is true and that gives us such a
[1:04:14] blessed hope when we know that what we
[1:04:17] read out of the word God the all
[1:04:21] sufficient one will keep that word not
[1:04:25] one J or one little one title shall fail
[1:04:29] what a perfect
[1:04:32] Assurance as we read where others have
[1:04:35] taken him at his word and to see that
[1:04:38] sometimes it looks very crucial it looks
[1:04:41] like sometimes that it's going to fail
[1:04:44] but it just don't
[1:04:47] fail
[1:04:49] amen sometimes we look at the promise of
[1:04:52] God like I it's not going to happen as
[1:04:54] if going to fail but it will not
[1:04:58] fail
[1:05:00] amen amen when God promises healing he
[1:05:05] promises Deliverance he promises Victory
[1:05:08] all the promises in the Bible are
[1:05:11] true amen and we receive them by
[1:05:16] faith amen so all the redempt blessings
[1:05:22] in Christ Jesus are yours
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:28] amen let us read in the Bible and then
[1:05:32] you find out that every promise in the
[1:05:36] Bible every Redemptive blessing in the
[1:05:40] Bible I believe in uh in the message
[1:05:43] that talken the prophet says if the if
[1:05:46] the blood of Jesus Christ is in you amen
[1:05:51] and Christ is living in you you are a
[1:05:54] child of God
[1:05:56] and you are a daughter of God and
[1:05:59] everything that God has is yours you
[1:06:03] have a right to
[1:06:05] eat you are you become a hair together
[1:06:09] with Christ
[1:06:11] Jesus
[1:06:12] amen amen but then uh the prophet says
[1:06:18] but
[1:06:19] then though those promises are
[1:06:23] ours we have a right to those
[1:06:26] promises but there are
[1:06:30] conditions amen there are condition set
[1:06:34] in order to get
[1:06:37] them
[1:06:39] amen sometimes we might pray we might
[1:06:42] fast we might do this and the other and
[1:06:45] all that we can do and we don't get what
[1:06:49] we are asking for because there are
[1:06:54] conditions amen
[1:06:57] says there are conditions to get those
[1:07:00] promises there are conditions to get
[1:07:03] those
[1:07:04] blessings amen until you fulfill those
[1:07:09] conditions you will not get what God or
[1:07:13] what you are requesting or what you
[1:07:15] asking from God amen
[1:07:18] amen is that right yeah brother says
[1:07:22] here in the message influence
[1:07:33] influence preached in
[1:07:40] 63 uh 11 12 paragraph
[1:07:47] 10 he says all promise of God are
[1:07:52] true but they are uncond conditions
[1:07:57] amen no matter how fundamentally right
[1:08:00] we are we have got to approach it in the
[1:08:03] right
[1:08:05] way now man can be fundamental right and
[1:08:09] still not receive the blessings of God
[1:08:11] because it is approached in a wrong
[1:08:14] way it goes upon
[1:08:18] conditions
[1:08:20] wow praise God so we can pray we can f
[1:08:25] us we can do everything but you must go
[1:08:29] according to the conditions that God has
[1:08:33] said
[1:08:34] amen then you can receive what God wants
[1:08:38] you to
[1:08:40] receive
[1:08:42] amen amen in the message also the world
[1:08:46] is falling
[1:08:48] apart I will not read so many many
[1:08:50] things but I just want to to just get
[1:08:53] some points here the
[1:08:58] word is falling
[1:09:06] apart uh that is preaching
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:14] 63 11
[1:09:17] 15 and the paragraph 143
[1:09:33] wow now we find out that God promis to
[1:09:37] supply all of our needs is that
[1:09:43] right the needs we have need of in this
[1:09:46] journey is that right congregation say
[1:09:49] Amen but remember he only supplies it on
[1:09:54] condition
[1:09:57] we have got to meet his condition first
[1:10:01] if we do not meet his condition he will
[1:10:03] not meet our condition we have got to do
[1:10:07] the thing that's right first got to go
[1:10:10] down to the bottom and build up that's
[1:10:13] exactly we can't start at the top and
[1:10:15] come down we have got to go to the
[1:10:17] bottom and build up go back to the
[1:10:20] Bottom now he'll meet our condition all
[1:10:24] of his promises are on
[1:10:28] condition

[1:10:33] but I've been praying and praying is
[1:10:35] that
[1:10:37] why my prayers have not been
[1:10:39] answered maybe there are some conditions

[1:16:38] name of the
[1:16:39] Lord

[1:16:43] amen and then God speaks to his servant
[1:16:48] Elijah he says come
[1:16:52] Elijah I have commanded Ed a widow woman
[1:16:57] to sustain

[1:17:46] drought but there is some water that
[1:17:49] I've been
[1:17:50] keeping God wanting to know her heart
[1:17:55] amen and when she was willing the man of
[1:17:59] God says oh no I didn't mean water I
[1:18:02] meant
[1:18:03] food God bring for me
[1:18:06] food and bring it for me cook it for me

[1:18:40] die the man of God says no go and cook
[1:18:44] it for me

[1:19:15] condition amen and then after she fed
[1:19:19] the man of God the man of God say okay
[1:19:21] go and cook for yourself and the Bible
[1:19:24] say say that food sustain
[1:19:28] them amen for the three and a half
[1:19:33] years
[1:19:35] amen that was a des for had to survive
[1:19:38] to live throughout that a that time with
[1:19:42] her son is that right and the Bible says
[1:19:47] that boy one time
[1:19:51] died amen but then God through the
[1:19:55] servant his servant he prayed for the
[1:19:58] child and the child came back to life a
[1:20:02] double the dou of
[1:20:04] portion sustain them throughout the year
[1:20:07] throughout the drought throughout the
[1:20:10] hunger and then back

[1:20:19] condition amen what about if that woman
[1:20:23] could have said no no no I can't give
[1:20:25] you my food I can't no no no this food

[1:20:32] die could have she been sustained
[1:20:34] throughout the week could could have
[1:20:37] that child come back to life so there
[1:20:40] was a
[1:20:41] condition and the moment she made the
[1:20:45] condition all the desire of her heart
[1:20:49] was granted
[1:20:51] her amen
[1:20:56] amen I believe that
[1:20:59] Brothers amen let us go to the shite
[1:21:03] woman amen the Bible says I may not read
[1:21:07] that one but we know it the Bible says
[1:21:10] there was a shunamite
[1:21:12] woman
[1:21:14] amen and then she's she a man of God
[1:21:20] Amen
[1:21:22] recognizing the man of God she says to
[1:21:25] her husband this man who passes
[1:21:29] here he looks to be a man
[1:21:34] of and you know sometimes even the
[1:21:36] church fails to recognize their Pastor
[1:21:39] as a man of God yeah but this woman
[1:21:45] recognizes this is a man of God that's
[1:21:49] why even H the the widow woman recognize
[1:21:53] Elijah as a man of
[1:21:57] amen even the queen of she she
[1:22:00] recognized Solomon as a man of
[1:22:03] God Amen that's what says whoever
[1:22:07] receives you has received me as a man of
[1:22:12] God Amen so the Bible says this woman
[1:22:16] said to her husband the man who always
[1:22:18] passes here he looks to be a man of God
[1:22:22] why don't we build for him something
[1:22:25] h house and put beddings there and put
[1:22:29] food there so that whenever he
[1:22:31] comes amen he he he he rests
[1:22:36] there he he gets conforted there he he
[1:22:39] gets something to eat
[1:22:41] there
[1:22:42] amen and she did it several times and
[1:22:47] then God was happy she met the
[1:22:53] condition is that right right and the
[1:22:56] Bible says the spirit Came Upon elishah
[1:22:58] and elishah says come on call that
[1:23:03] woman because of what she has
[1:23:06] done she has met the
[1:23:10] condition
[1:23:11] amen and when she was called she said
[1:23:16] you woman according the time of
[1:23:19] life you are going to embrace a child
[1:23:23] says no no no man of God don't deceive
[1:23:27] don't lie don't lie to your
[1:23:30] maid
[1:23:31] amen my husband is
[1:23:35] old isn't that what G said she doesn't
[1:23:38] have a child even husband is old meaning
[1:23:42] that this woman had prayed and fasted
[1:23:46] and prayed for a child but she had not
[1:23:49] got
[1:23:50] it yes
[1:23:55] yes God waiting for her to meet a
[1:24:00] condition and she said no my husband is
[1:24:04] old I am also old we can't get
[1:24:08] that but the Bible says it happened
[1:24:12] according to the word of the man of God
[1:24:16] she embraced a child is that
[1:24:19] right amen now that woman had had been
[1:24:23] praying and fasting all that time she
[1:24:26] was a Godly woman according the
[1:24:29] Bible amen but God was waiting for her
[1:24:34] to meet a certain condition and that was
[1:24:38] to receive the man of God Amen and keep
[1:24:42] him and feed him and then God gives her
[1:24:46] the desire of her
[1:24:48] heart
[1:24:50] amen amen and the Bible tells us that
[1:24:55] boy one day was working with the
[1:24:58] father and he started crying oh my head
[1:25:01] my head my head oh my head and then the
[1:25:05] the father says okay take him there to
[1:25:07] lay with lay down there a bit to rest
[1:25:09] and the boy
[1:25:12] dies and when the woman had a boy had
[1:25:17] died he went and L him on the bed of
[1:25:22] Elijah amen and she said God me let me
[1:25:26] go to that man I told him I I not desire
[1:25:30] I not ask him for the
[1:25:32] child he must and they rod and Elijah
[1:25:36] said now oh my Deacon you take this Roo
[1:25:41] and and and lay on the Sun the woman
[1:25:43] says as thy God
[1:25:46] liveth
[1:25:48] hallelujah all thy God leaveth all thy
[1:25:51] soul leaveth I shall not leave you
[1:25:54] Hallelujah I shall not leave you
[1:25:58] Hallelujah I must go with you and when
[1:26:01] they went Hallelujah they found the boy
[1:26:04] was dead and Elijah laid on the child is
[1:26:07] it seven
[1:26:09] times and the boy came back to
[1:26:12] life a
[1:26:14] double double portion
[1:26:18] amen amen amen giving the child and also
[1:26:24] raising the child back to life double op
[1:26:28] portion so there are things that God
[1:26:32] wants you to receive but there are
[1:26:35] conditions and you might not know what
[1:26:39] the condition
[1:26:41] is amen but when you meet that condition
[1:26:45] God gives you the desire of your
[1:26:50] heart amen
[1:26:56] amen
[1:26:58] amen
[1:27:00] wow yes look
[1:27:03] at uh let us look at
[1:27:06] Abraham amen God gave him a promise of a
[1:27:13] son
[1:27:15] amen and Abraham was waiting for the son
[1:27:20] and believing for the son and trusting
[1:27:23] God will fulfill his
[1:27:26] word amen but for 25 years there is
[1:27:31] nothing and it's God who promised
[1:27:35] him amen God told Abraham I am going to
[1:27:40] give you a
[1:27:42] son until then the wife said no maybe
[1:27:46] God was meaning this woman let another
[1:27:49] woman let me give you another woman but
[1:27:52] God's word can never fail
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:27:56] God meant who
[1:28:00] sah now I'm too old how can that promise
[1:28:03] be fulfilled but God's word can never
[1:28:06] fail if God said something he's going to
[1:28:10] prove it he's going to make it to come
[1:28:12] to pass
[1:28:15] Hallelujah and here comes god with the
[1:28:19] two angels
[1:28:20] walking to fulfill the the promise amen
[1:28:26] but their
[1:28:29] conditions amen he just goes as if he's
[1:28:33] passing away just walking like he's
[1:28:37] going AB said that man identifying who
[1:28:41] the man of
[1:28:43] God that man looks to be a man of God
[1:28:47] man no no no don't pass by come come and
[1:28:51] and at least just have a drink of water
[1:28:55] amen is that right brothers and then
[1:28:58] Abraham fed them and took milk and they
[1:29:02] ate a cal and so and then when God was
[1:29:07] satisfied
[1:29:09] amen
[1:29:12] amen I don't know whether maybe was the
[1:29:16] smell of the Cal and the mil was now
[1:29:19] coming
[1:29:21] out where is s your wife
[1:29:25] oh she's in the T in the time of
[1:29:30] life Sarah is going to have a
[1:29:33] child
[1:29:35] Hallelujah and the Bible says sah say
[1:29:39] surely this man instead of just eating

[1:30:50] bit Acts chapter 10 the Bible says
[1:30:59] Acts chapter
[1:31:03] 10 verse one there was a man a certain
[1:31:07] man in kisia uh called
[1:31:10] Cornelius a centurion of the band called
[1:31:13] The Italian band a devote man and one
[1:31:18] that feared God with all his house which
[1:31:21] gave much arms to the people and pray to
[1:31:26] God
[1:31:27] always he saw in a vision about the nth
[1:31:30] hour of the day an angel of God coming
[1:31:32] into him and saying unto him Cornelius
[1:31:35] and when he had looked on him he was
[1:31:37] afraid and said what is it Lord and he
[1:31:40] said unto him thy prayers and thine arms
[1:31:43] are come up for a memorial before
[1:31:47] God and now send man to Jer and call for
[1:31:50] one Simon whose son name is Peter he
[1:31:53] loes with one Simon atana whose house is
[1:31:56] by the seaside he shall tell thee what
[1:31:59] thou oughtest to do meaning that
[1:32:04] Cornelius had a
[1:32:06] desire is that
[1:32:08] right and he was always praying and
[1:32:11] praying and praying but one good thing
[1:32:15] he was
[1:32:16] also giving the
[1:32:19] poor
[1:32:21] amen amen
[1:32:24] giving the PO that was the condition
[1:32:27] that God had set before him and the
[1:32:30] Bible says one day one night I think it
[1:32:33] was around around 3 an angel came to
[1:32:39] him us you are
[1:32:42] giving and your prayers have come before
[1:32:47] God now send someone to J and call one
[1:32:51] call

[1:32:57] and give you the desire of your
[1:33:00] heart Hallelujah and the Bible says then
[1:33:04] Peter came and Peter saided preaching
[1:33:07] and
[1:33:08] speaking and before even complete the
[1:33:13] preaching the Holy Ghost came upon these
[1:33:15] people what was the Cornelius it was
[1:33:20] salvation
[1:33:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:25] and Before Peter when Peter was still
[1:33:30] speaking Hallelujah the Holy Ghost fell
[1:33:35] on and they started speaking
[1:33:38] tongues
[1:33:40] Hallelujah until the people were pet say
[1:33:43] even the Gentiles have received the Holy
[1:33:45] Ghost like us I believe that was the
[1:33:48] first time when the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:33:50] the Gentiles and Peter said now who can
[1:33:54] stop these people from being baptized
[1:33:56] who have received the Holy Ghost just
[1:33:58] like
[1:34:00] us and he commanded them to be baptized
[1:34:04] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:07] Christ amen that's right the
[1:34:11] desire amen of Cornelius was met he was
[1:34:17] given the desire of his heart amen did
[1:34:23] he get a double por
[1:34:24] portion did he get double portion yes he
[1:34:28] received the word and then receed the
[1:34:30] Holy Spirit praise God
[1:34:35] amen
[1:34:37] amen oh praise

[1:34:45] Bible the Bible says Dockers used to to
[1:34:48] make good things not so

[1:34:56] what will they say oh God remember the
[1:34:59] good
[1:35:00] things this this woman has been doing I
[1:35:04] believe she was making those things and
[1:35:06] she was giving them out the church is
[1:35:08] that
[1:35:09] right and because of that the Bible says
[1:35:13] when Peter went there the widows and the
[1:35:17] people who were around there they were
[1:35:18] showing Peter you see the good things
[1:35:21] this woman has been doing Hall alah and
[1:35:25] when Peter Just prayed for her she came

[1:36:18] of God when it has gone forth it must
[1:36:21] come to pass
[1:36:25] but
[1:36:26] prayer can change
[1:36:29] things prayer can change the mind of
[1:36:33] God Amen it's only a prayer that can
[1:36:36] change the mind of
[1:36:41] God

[1:36:54] said unto him thou says the Lord set
[1:36:57] thine house in order for Thou shalt die
[1:37:00] and not

[1:40:14] years I believe the people that could
[1:40:17] have been around could have said is just
[1:40:20] a man this man is a false prophet
[1:40:24] the other time he says he's going to die
[1:40:27] again is coming he's going to live now
[1:40:29] which one is
[1:40:30] which but
[1:40:32] ezekiah had made the
[1:40:34] conditions praise
[1:40:37] God ah is my time
[1:40:40] over just
[1:40:42] maybe 10
[1:40:45] minutes
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:49] amen I just wanted to to give the
[1:40:52] testimony of sister
[1:40:54] and then we
[1:40:55] close
[1:40:57] amen the prophet was talking about
[1:40:59] sister hatti he said sister haty was a
[1:41:02] poor Widow in the
[1:41:04] church amen and now they were uh talking
[1:41:09] about the construction of a new church I
[1:41:12] believe and sister
[1:41:14] hatti uh
[1:41:17] gave pledge 20 is it something like $50
[1:41:21] then the Deon say no no no sister 30 we
[1:41:24] know your condition you are too poor now
[1:41:26] if you give that $50 how are you going
[1:41:28] to live how are you going to sustain
[1:41:30] yourself so they told her maybe you you
[1:41:32] give
[1:41:35] $20 so when the prophet heard about
[1:41:39] that he said he wanted to give back
[1:41:42] sister her money because the condition
[1:41:46] that she was in was not
[1:41:48] good
[1:41:50] but according to him say that
[1:41:56] the spirit spoke to him and said no
[1:41:58] don't do that because there is something
[1:41:59] for her own there on the
[1:42:03] way amen that giving of that
[1:42:07] $20 amen amen was the condition that God
[1:42:12] has set before her and when she did that
[1:42:16] amen God gave her the desire of her
[1:42:20] heart maybe let us read that one and
[1:42:23] then we close my new
[1:42:30] ministry my new
[1:42:34] ministry uh preaching
[1:42:41] 59
[1:42:43] my new
[1:42:51] ministry paragraph 491
[1:43:05] are we
[1:43:12] together uh it says that poor Widow who
[1:43:15] had just told me that she Tred to give
[1:43:18] to this church $50 on a
[1:43:21] pledge to help build a new church and
[1:43:25] brother Robertson wouldn't take it and
[1:43:28] only let her give 20 of it and I said to
[1:43:32] myself when she was speaking I'll give
[1:43:35] her back the
[1:43:37] 20 but God said to me in my heart now
[1:43:41] not my my vision in my heart when Jesus
[1:43:45] was standing watching a widow woman put
[1:43:48] in three pennies where where where there
[1:43:52] were thousand
[1:43:53] of dollarss laying there what would have
[1:43:56] you
[1:43:58] done I said well if I would have been
[1:44:01] standing there said we don't need it
[1:44:03] sister we got plenty of money but Jesus
[1:44:07] never said
[1:44:08] it he let her go on and do it because he
[1:44:12] know what was down the
[1:44:15] road come
[1:44:17] on
[1:44:19] Hallelujah he know what was down the
[1:44:22] road for for
[1:44:23] her so help me God as my solemn judge
[1:44:28] God knew that was down the road for her
[1:44:32] and I run my hand in my pocket to get my
[1:44:34] pocket book to give her her $20 back and
[1:44:37] say sister but he said don't do it and
[1:44:40] then a few minutes when the question is
[1:44:42] is brought up about Jehovah J she said
[1:44:45] that is nothing but a truth and it come
[1:44:49] from a poor widow woman's heart God
[1:44:52] knowing she would ask the greater thing
[1:44:54] could be
[1:44:55] done as long as there is heaven when the
[1:44:59] stars is gone when there is no more moon
[1:45:01] no more Earth no more sea them boys
[1:45:04] shall live on through eternity with the
[1:45:07] same Jehovah who gave the immortal
[1:45:10] promise his promise cannot
[1:45:12] fail oh praise
[1:45:15] God hallelujah so the giving sister had
[1:45:20] to give that $20
[1:45:24] amen amen that was the
[1:45:27] condition that God had set before her as
[1:45:31] poor as she
[1:45:33] was like the other widow woman who
[1:45:37] entertained elishah Elijah and fed El
[1:45:41] that was the only in fact somewhere the
[1:45:44] prophet says that oh
[1:45:47] my amen amen she she was the poorest in
[1:45:52] the church but the condition that God
[1:45:54] has said before her was to give the
[1:45:59] $20
[1:46:01] amen and when she did that oh Kum there
[1:46:05] was a promise coming on the
[1:46:07] way there God was not going to answer
[1:46:11] and Grant unto her the desire of her
[1:46:16] heart
[1:46:19] amen amen
[1:46:23] oh praise
[1:46:25] God maybe let me read another one go
[1:46:29] tell and then we shall
[1:46:32] close
[1:46:34] go go tell sorry it will take you long
[1:46:39] but I believe this is wonderful for
[1:46:42] me because sometimes you can pray and
[1:46:45] pray and pray and we don't receive what
[1:46:48] we are praying God wanting you to meet a
[1:46:50] certain condition
[1:46:53] 175 the prophet says
[1:46:56] here
[1:47:01] amen and hat maybe not knowing what the
[1:47:04] woman was saying look how it bypass the
[1:47:07] rich and the Hy look how it bypass
[1:47:09] everything and come to a poor little old
[1:47:12] country woman there and I had $20 in my
[1:47:15] pocket to give back to the woman that
[1:47:17] she had pled $50 on the on this new
[1:47:19] church coming up and I don't say this to
[1:47:22] embarrass her she couldn't afford 50
[1:47:24] cents really to give it but her heart in
[1:47:28] the message she wanted to brother
[1:47:30] brother N I believe had accepted to take
[1:47:34] the the rest of just let her give $20 of
[1:47:37] it and I had
[1:47:39] 20 I had two 10 bills in my pocket mea
[1:47:43] had given me for groceries and I said
[1:47:46] I'm going to give it back to her today
[1:47:49] then I thought something spoke to me
[1:47:51] said Jesus see that we put putting in
[1:47:53] her three pennies and he never took it
[1:47:55] back from her he let her go on because
[1:47:58] he had something greater down the
[1:48:01] road praise God little or did I know he
[1:48:05] was speaking to me the same way of a
[1:48:06] widow woman no husband husband was
[1:48:09] killed neither did I know that that was
[1:48:11] the the same one when I said then I'll
[1:48:14] just keep the $20 you have something
[1:48:16] else for her I said only thing I know
[1:48:19] that Jehovah is Jehovah he is able to
[1:48:22] provide a sacrifice and haty not knowing
[1:48:25] what she was saying raised up and said
[1:48:27] that is nothing but the truth brother
[1:48:30] brother oh my that was the right thing
[1:48:33] to say that was the right thing to say
[1:48:35] about that time the power of God struck
[1:48:38] that place I never felt such anointing
[1:48:41] when he did I saidy thus says the Lord

[1:53:52] praise the lord we love the Lord
[1:53:56] tonight if we can just put up Psalm
[1:53:58] chapter 37
[1:54:00] verse4 Psalm 37
[1:54:08] verse4 I love uh the word tonight amen
[1:54:13] now you see many times when the preacher
[1:54:15] preach like
[1:54:16] this uh people that are used to what is
[1:54:20] happening out there they think that is a
[1:54:22] way of setting the scene for you to
[1:54:25] start giving gifts you know and uh uh
[1:54:30] Prosperity people might use that but uh
[1:54:34] I don't think that's what our brother
[1:54:36] was offer I think you get that right
[1:54:41] amen there is a condition set and Jesus
[1:54:45] when he read that scripture in Matthew
[1:54:47] Jesus
[1:54:50] said if you recognize
[1:54:53] a prophet you will give a prophet reward
[1:54:56] amen so there is a condition that is set
[1:54:59] and that condition is for you to be able
[1:55:02] to
[1:55:04] identify what God is doing in that
[1:55:09] moment identify what God is doing
[1:55:12] identify the one that God is
[1:55:15] using praise the Lord
[1:55:20] amen and sometimes that that is the
[1:55:23] thing that slip
[1:55:24] us because look here the colus was
[1:55:27] giving arms he was just giving he wasn't
[1:55:30] he was a nice man praise the Lord but
[1:55:33] you see Peter has to
[1:55:37] come this colinus was a
[1:55:40] gentile Peter was a
[1:55:46] Jew and colus have to be brought to the
[1:55:49] knowledge of what was happening at that
[1:55:52] time time what God was doing at that
[1:55:55] time for the desire of his heart to be
[1:55:59] made now the scripture says here sorry
[1:56:02] they had that of psalm
[1:56:04] 37:4 we read it this morning and for
[1:56:07] some reason we had to recite it together
[1:56:09] as a family Delight thyself also in the
[1:56:13] Lord and He Shall give Thee the desire
[1:56:18] of thine
[1:56:20] heart Delight yourself because just like
[1:56:24] the brother said you don't we we you
[1:56:26] don't know you can't guess the condition
[1:56:27] that might be set but you have to
[1:56:30] delight yourself in the Lord delight
[1:56:33] yourself in God's
[1:56:35] word praise the lord lord if it's your
[1:56:39] way I'm I'm you know I I you know I I
[1:56:42] don't know the condition set but give me
[1:56:44] a heart to Delight myself God will grant
[1:56:48] the desire of your heart but he said you
[1:56:50] must delight yourself in the
