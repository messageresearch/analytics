[2:39] to show the Airing church this day that
[2:43] is Hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today
[2:46] and forever
[2:48] Barkley promised another to come flying
[2:51] from the wilderness
[2:52] amen
[2:54] that's exactly the truth how fitting and
[2:57] matching it is to Luke 17 30 for the son
[3:00] of man Eagle will be repeating itself
[3:02] to bring to not all other worship places
[3:05] such as denominations and so forth
[3:08] God chose His Place John said There It
[3:11] Is
[3:12] and then we're promised the same thing
[3:13] in this day Malachi 4 to turn the hearts
[3:16] of the children back to say that he's
[3:18] not dead these things are not for
[3:19] another age baptism in Jesus name is not
[3:22] for back there but he's now the same
[3:25] right hey man
[3:28] to bring to know all other places of
[3:31] worship
[3:33] that's what the last day Eagle is to do
[3:35] to show that all the rest of it is
[3:38] foolishness the nomination is folly
[3:42] but to part them again with the same
[3:45] sign that he did that he's the same
[3:47] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[3:52] also in Revelations 4 7 we had four
[3:55] beasts have we just been through with
[3:57] the first one was before I find out was
[4:01] the line that was the first Beast that
[4:03] went forth to meet the challenge of that
[4:05] day the lion of the tribe of Judah after
[4:08] him come the next beast and we find out
[4:10] the next Beast was an ox which is a
[4:13] beast of burden a sacrifice and the days
[4:15] of the Roman Cathedral the church died
[4:18] out sacrifice the next come was a mat
[4:21] was a beast with a face of a man and
[4:23] that man was reformers man's education
[4:25] Theology and so forth but the last Beast
[4:29] that was to fly the last Feast that was
[4:32] to come the Bible said it was a flying
[4:34] eagle

[4:55] been a day that's just a shadow can you

[5:38] evening time and why
[5:40] to welcome his children back home to the
[5:43] true Promised Land by the same sign of
[5:47] the pillar of fire that led the children
[5:49] of Israel through the wilderness
[5:51] God's chosen place to worship Him Jesus
[5:54] Christ that's the only place there is
[5:57] That's The Only Name God has for

[6:56] the evening lights have come
[6:58] it is the facts that God in Christ are
[7:02] one
[7:04] oh brother sister if you haven't
[7:06] repented yet if you haven't been
[7:09] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[7:10] would you make that start tonight would
[7:13] you give God the opportunity to welcome
[7:15] you into the place where you can worship
[7:17] him remember outside of there there is
[7:21] no place that God promised to meet you
[7:23] and welcome your worship you say brother
[7:26] Bram I worship this is sincere so did
[7:29] King
[7:30] he made every kind of an offering that
[7:33] Abel did but it was a wrong offering you
[7:37] might go to church and pay your tithes
[7:39] and do your duty as a Christian altude
[7:41] just as sincere as any man or woman
[7:44] I stood here now for some 30 years
[7:46] around the city here and screened this
[7:48] same message
[7:50] I'm getting old
[7:51] I can't be with you too much longer but
[7:54] remember in the day of judgment my voice
[7:56] is recorded
[7:58] they'll speak out against you there's
[8:00] only one place that God puts his name
[8:03] and that's not in a church but in Jesus
[8:06] there's only one place of worship only
[8:09] one place that you are received and that
[8:11] is in the Beloved Jesus Christ
[8:14] there's not another name under Heaven
[8:16] given among men whereby be saved no
[8:18] church no Creed no nothing Jesus Christ
[8:20] and that's supposed to be the message of
[8:23] the hour to restore back the hearts of
[8:25] the children back to the faith that was
[8:27] once delivered to the Saints
[8:29] won't you accept it tonight and while we
[8:32] have our heads bound and those who like
[8:34] to be remembered in prayer would you
[8:35] just raise your hands we can't make an
[8:37] older call because it's just two men God
[8:39] bless you my on my left I guess he's 300
[8:42] now to my right would you raise your
[8:44] hand say I want to be remembered I guess
[8:46] he's 150 or more on my right

[9:12] promise of God of your sincere in your
[9:13] heart to receive the baptism the Holy

[10:47] already been judged it will not have to
[10:50] come to judgment God poured out his
[10:52] wrath upon that body
[10:54] and that body is free from sin and being
[10:58] in him puts us free from sin by his

[13:49] healing now
[13:50] is there any sick among us let them
[13:53] raise your hands right or left
[13:56] great crowds of sickness I can't call
[13:59] the line you see I haven't I can't come
[14:01] up on the platform there's no way of
[14:02] doing it they're having prayer meetings
[14:04] out in the other places for the sick and
[14:06] the churches and things
[14:07] down the Tabernacle I'm going to ask you
[14:09] something how many Believers is there
[14:11] raise your hand all right I'm going to
[14:14] quote to you the word which is Christ
[14:16] Jesus likes commission to the world and
[14:19] to the church brother he said this these
[14:22] signs shall follow them that believe if
[14:24] they lay their hands on the sick they
[14:26] shall recover how many knows that's true
[14:28] Mark 16 say Amen
[14:30] all right I'm asking you as a Believer
[14:33] to lay hands on somebody in front of you
[14:35] just lay your hands over on somebody in
[14:37] front of you unless each one pray a
[14:39] prayer for each other now put your hands
[14:41] over on somebody around
[14:50] Lord
[14:53] here before me is a box of handkerchiefs
[14:57] little pieces of goods
[15:00] some old mother Lane some were dying a
[15:03] baby near death
[15:05] sick people everywhere
[15:09] we read in a Bible that detect from the
[15:11] body of Paul handkerchiefs and aprons
[15:14] and they were placed upon the sick and
[15:16] evil spirits and unclean spirits and
[15:18] sicknesses and diseases departed from
[15:21] the people
[15:22] now Lord we know we're not Saint Paul
[15:24] but we know that you still remain Jesus
[15:27] the only God provided place of worship
[15:31] and now today these people has confessed
[15:34] their same faith
[15:36] as believing like those people did
[15:38] surely you have made a way for them
[15:41] and I put my hands upon these
[15:44] handkerchiefs and asked that the
[15:46] diseases and afflictions leave the
[15:48] bodies of the people these will be laid
[15:50] on in the name of Jesus Christ
[15:53] now we are taught that as Israel was
[15:56] coming out of Egypt in the line of duty
[15:58] they were on the road to the promised
[16:01] land the Red Sea got in their way
[16:04] and God looked down to the pillar of
[16:07] fire and the Sea got scared rolled back
[16:11] and let Israel pass to the promised land
[16:13] oh god look down through the blood of
[16:16] Jesus tonight and may the sickness roll
[16:19] back
[16:20] and Satan be cast out and may the people
[16:24] pass to that promise of good health and
[16:26] strength that God set up of all things I
[16:29] wish you would prosper in hell
[16:31] now as you see Lord Jesus the hands of
[16:34] these people laying on each other
[16:36] they're symbolizing their faith that you
[16:40] said these signs shall follow them that
[16:42] believe they're praying in their own way
[16:45] for one another the next person's
[16:48] praying for them
[16:50] now Lord this challenge has been met
[16:53] that Satan the big Bluff
[16:56] he has no right to hold a child of God
[16:59] he is a defeated being Jesus Christ the
[17:03] only place of worship the only true name
[17:05] defeated him at Calvary and we claim his
[17:08] blood right now that he defeated every
[17:10] sickness ever disease and uh call for
[17:14] Satan to lead this audience in the name
[17:16] of Jesus Christ come out of this people
