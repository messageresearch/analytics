Thank you for making the sacrifice to be here this morning. And uh uh just a little update, we uh uh the service was cancelled Wednesday because the technicians were yet to work and then uh uh and then the guy talked about a smell that was coming from up there. So that was the reason why we cancelled the service, but then they couldn't get the fun repair. the condition is for it to be replaced and uh that uh came up on uh I think uh Thursday or Friday. So the decision uh had to be made with the by the trustees and then uh uh so the trustee decided to the the furnace. So they will be replacing the funnest and uh it is just how quicker we can get them in. They didn't work. They don't work on the weekends. So, uh we couldn't get them in on the weekends and uh so uh uh we will hope that uh they can get the furnace repaired before the next Sunday service. Amen. &gt;&gt; If uh uh the service if the furnace is not repaired on Wednesday, we will also not have service on Wednesday. and uh we're trying to uh make sure that it can get repaired before next Sunday. Praise the Lord. So, we'll let you know during the week and uh uh thank you for for uh u bearing with us. Talking with brother Max and we were talking about how, you know, how how expensive is coming. I said, "Well, it's the end of the year, you know. Uh uh but we must not forget that after every trial there is a blessing. Amen. We don't know what the blessing is now. We know what our trial is. So let's just uh let's embrace our trial and look forward for the blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you have to remember you got to rejoice in the trial &gt;&gt; for the blessing to really mean a whole lot to you. So that just uh let's uh let's bear with this trial for now. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will make your tri turn your trial into blessing. Amen. Praise the Lord. So uh uh but before I share with you the little thought I had on my heart this morning, Sister Annette, I know I have not sent anything out there. I'm going to send it out to you in biting pieces. Uh just few things that we would like to share. But before I do that, I want to greet uh sister experience. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to greet sister experience. uh assisted experience. Uh she's uh she is uh she's uh kind of a mother figure to us when we got over to the Aricourse and and getting to know them and uh uh so she she thought to come over. She was in the country last year. She wanted to come and see us which of course will have been a good time because it was not cold but this time around she said she have to see us before she go back so she had to come in the call to see us. So sister experience you are welcome. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are very welcome. Amen. You are very welcome. uh she sent me her little testimony that she wanted me to share with you and uh but like I said we've been knowing her and her family over the years uh over the years we've been uh and their family being a very very much of a blessing to us. Now remember now I came into the Aricourse as a as a young refugee boy and then uh I was uh towards the border part of the country. So I would have to come to the cafeter. I have friends there that will visit and every time I come they will always make sure that they can gather some some uh substance for us to take back you know to the people that that we were with. uh so they would gather money and whatever they could and uh and and support us. know just been uh a great blessing you know to know him great blessing there's a whole lot I can share to share with you about our sister but one of the most thing I would say that that kind of rejoice me and rejoice every one of us and uh uh uh she's uh she's married and uh her husband went to be with the Lord uh but uh before going to be with the Lord. This was a man I think uh they got married before our sister believed the message. So uh she was a believer. The husband was not a believer and uh uh he was uh uh practicing the Catholic faith and but he was a man that had high regard for the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and I mean he treated us with lot of respect. If you were If you were a message believer misbehaving around him, he will kick you from his house. He just has such a respect for the message of the hour. He will not stop his wife and his children, you know, from coming to service, going to convention, you know. So over the years, we call him a secret believer, you know. We call him a secret believer. And no doubt we uh there was just something there just the time. We didn't know God's time, but we knew that this man would believe this message just because of the respect that he had in the message. And I would not doubt that he was reading the message secretly. I won't doubt it because there are times where he will he will question certain believers of doing certain thing and says, you know, the message you shouldn't do this. You know, that was the kind of a person he was. He was uh he was an international auditor. He was living in the Aricos and working in France and Virgin and you know you travel and come back and uh uh but uh so couple of years uh went on we you know we all traveled and and uh uh it will happen this year. I can't even remember the year now. Uh, I got a call from back home that he was going to be baptized. Man, I says, "Whoa." Amen. It was it was a news that kind of shook the message community, you know, not in a bad way, in a good way because it was expected, you know, it was expected that this man, you know, uh, praise the Lord. I wish I didn't baptize him. I would have kept him under the water longer. He said, "Why you took so long to come?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. But such such a good man. So after dad uh and his daughter got married over in Virginia, she's there with uh Pastor Mark Walls and we had to go down and support her on the wedding and uh uh never have much time to spend because I was on my way out right after the wedding. But I was hoping they to come and spend some time with us, but he too have to go back just because of some of his responsibility. And it was uh it was it was a sad thing to hear that he left us so soon, you know, after after embracing the word of the hour. And uh and all I could hear from back home was he was kind of a straight believer, you know, it has to be the word or just just keep him out of it, &gt;&gt; you know. So God God is good &gt;&gt; you know his ways his past finding out &gt;&gt; you know and some of the things that he would do is just in his time &gt;&gt; you know it's just in his time so that was uh uh you know sister experience and there's another sister uh that uh the uh you know their testimony their family testimony has uh has really encourage us over the years that there is there's nothing that go you know uh uh when the other sister visit us then we will talk about her let's not talk about her today so uh uh our sister just sent me a little um note of things she says uh I give thanks to the lord who made it possible for me to arrive here in Minneapolis to visit uh the family of pastor one who also uh who is also my family. There is not enough words to fully express my gratitude to u brother one and sister do that's how my wife is called in a so that's a middle name for who they are to us you know pastor one is a son to my husband and I and he has been my pastor for many years he is also big brother to my children and their pastor as well I thank God for giving him to us. Often when a family is shaken by the loss of his head or goes through several trials or some friends and even brethren's withdrawal, but it has not been the case with uh pastor one that is that is why I wish I read this before I'm reading it now. I would have just put it in in few words. That is why I I hold this man of God in such a high esteem. He is always u humble, simple, understanding and uh attentive to our situation. Since my husband who he lord called papa went to glory, pastor one has remained faithful by our side. May the Lord himself reward him uh in this uh uh incomparable love and may he bless his family and his church abundantly. And I also want to thank the church for all your prayers. Often when u uh often uh when I was stripped in the war or trapped in the war, sorry in Congo in February this year and and in June, we survived miraculously by your prayers. Even our loved ones who fell into enemy ambush were protected by the Lord. &gt;&gt; One week Before I left the country, I caught I was caught in an ambush while returning from church. The leader ordered that I should be taken away, but the hand of God miraculously protect me and they let me go. May the Lord bless you abundantly. Amen. Often we don't happen to express things in their depth as one. We have always loved you and we continue to love you even more. Amen. So, we thank the Lord and uh uh and it just it turned out that uh uh the part of the Congo that she's talking about is not too far from where brother Rafé family is now caught. Uh the city has been overtaken and uh so uh just keep uh his family and the saints in that region in prayer. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So uh we we just thank the Lord. Amen. You see uh uh we all are going through things. Praise the Lord. So never think what you are going through is so bad in order what other people are going through. We all are dealing with things. we in uh uh you know uh uh building now with enough heat this morning and some uh in much terrible condition and uh so let me not start going down that route but uh we will turn to Job chapter 19 where I read from last week. I want to get back there because uh uh there are few things that kept opening to me on the subject. A few few things that kept opening to me on the subject. So I want to get back to Job chapter 19 and uh praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So, I don't know where I put this. I don't know where I put this, but let's read Job chapter 19. Power of the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Job chapter 19, we will read from verse one. Then Job answered and said, "How long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words? These 10 times have ye reproached me. Yet I are not ashamed that ye Ye make yourself strange to me. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. We will continue to read. Yeah. Make yourself strange to me. Verse four. And uh and be it indeed that I have my earth remains with myself. If indeed ye will magnify yourself against me and plead against me my and plead against me my reproach. No now that God have overthrew me and have compassed me with his name. Behold I cry out of wrong but I am not heard. I cry aloud but there is no judgment. He defends up my ways that I cannot pass. He offends up my ways I cannot pass. He have set darkness in my path. He have stripped me of my glory and have crown and taken the crown from my head. He have destroyed me on every side and I am gone and my hope have he removed like a tree. He have also countered his wrath against me and he counts me unto him as one of his enemy. His troop come to together and rise up their ways against me and encamp around about my tabernacle. Ye have put my brethren far from me and my acquaintance are very estrange from me. My king's f has failed and my family friends have forgotten me. They that dwared in my house and my maid count me for a stranger. I am an alien in their sight. I call my servant and he gave me no answer. Uh I entreat him with my mouth. My birth is strange to my wife though I uh I intreat for the children's sake of my own body. Year young children despise me. I arose and they speak against me. All my inward friends I hug me and they wound and their womb love I turn against me. My bone cleave to the to my skin and to my flesh and I escape with the skin of my teeth. Have pity upon me have pity upon me. Oh ye my friends, for the hand of God has touched me. Why do you persecute me as God and are now satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my words were now written. Oh, that they were printed in the book, that they were engraved with an iron pen and laid in the rock forever. For I know that my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; And that he shall stand at the last day &gt;&gt; upon the earth. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we read this scripture, this verse, I know my redeemer live, it it come alive to us, it talks about the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon will say Job was prophesied. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I would tell you this morning, it was not only that verse was his prophecy. You realize that in the scripture many times the prophet spoke in the first person. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When David said, "My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?" He was speaking in the first person. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even though it was a prophecy, but he was speaking in the first person. And I as I was studying uh uh uh Job chapter 19, I realized that Job was speaking in the first person. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he said uh uh when we took our 12, all that my words were written, all that my words were were now written, all that they were imprinted in a book. I believe that he was speaking in the first person because this book is not Job book. This book is is God's book. Amen. &gt;&gt; This book is the word of God. So I believe that Job was speaking in the first person and Job was even prophesying. This morning I would I will I would like to share just a little thought with you and let you go and make you to see that when brother Brandham talked about the book of life and the lamb's book of life, God don't have a book like this book in heaven. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I give you just a simple idea. You go back from Genesis, we realize that in Genesis is where all the seeds were planted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So everything that was taught in God's mind, he saw them in Genesis. &gt;&gt; So we realize that when the Bible speaks about the the tree of life, the Bible said there were two trees that were in the garden. Amen. &gt;&gt; Among all the other trees that God made. Are we together? So when the Bible speaks about the tree of life, we realize that uh uh as we follow the word, we come to realize that that tree of life was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Definitely we would understand that also the tree of knowledge good and evil was the devil. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and the Bible would tell us that the tree of knowledge, it was good for food, it was good to the eyes, &gt;&gt; and it could make one wise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Trinity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When it talks about the tree that represent Christ, it was a tree of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It had one fruit and it was the fruit of life, but the other tree, it was good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and it could make one wise. So right there, we could see that they were they were not a a a physical tree like our trees outside. They these were trees that were pressing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? For the matter of fact uh in in in question and answer we have shared that with you. Brother Brandham says when God made man he made man upright like a tree and his toes was stuck in the earth like roots. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I've read that to you before. Amen. I read that to you before that uh his so so when God breath in the nostril of man God was not breathing like doing CPR. God was breathing directly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Bible would tells you that God made man upright. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; So man was not made flat on the ground. He was made upright. When Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man, he said, "I see men like trees." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When his when his sight were coming, he said, "I see men like trees." &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the reason why I'm going down this way is to is to is to help us to be able to see where I want to just grab you this morning and let you go is is to realize that the the the open book, what we call the open book, the revelation of the word that has been given to us this hour is to pick us up from where denominational increase has left us. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Job said, "I hope that my words," he says, "All that my words were were now written, all that they were printed in the book, that they were engraved with an iron pen and laid in the rock forever." Praise the Lord. I see that as a prophecy. When I look at there, when I read that and I read what Job has just told us here of how he was treated, I see both the book of life and I see the lamp book of life. &gt;&gt; I can see THE BOOK OF LIFE WITH JOB natural life. &gt;&gt; Yes. where he was one hell he was ONE RESPECTED BUT NOW NOBODY RESPECT him &gt;&gt; even his birth is strange when I read that alive I said that should be the last person that must complain about her husband birth is the wife &gt;&gt; if the wife is complaining which me is serious praise the lord amen because I mean this guy is lying down beside her with salava every night &gt;&gt; if she's complaining then it is very serious. You got to do something about it. &gt;&gt; But because when JOB SAYS, "I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVETH." AMEN. &gt;&gt; And that he shall stand in the little days upon the earth. And though after my skin destroy my body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN I LOOK AT JOB'S STORY, I SEE there as a portion in the Lamb book of life because it's speaking about redemption. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, GOD IN THE WAY HIS WORD is written, the prophet of God said uh question and answer ON GENESIS THAT GOD DID IT TO give us an idea of what his great thought is. So having an idea about something is not the actual thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you have an idea. SO IF GOD TELLS US THAT THERE IS A BOOK OF LIFE AND THERE IS A LAMP BOOK OF LIFE, HE'S GIVING YOU AN IDEA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That records are gathered. &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S NOT TELLING YOU THAT HE GET PAGES in heaven. &gt;&gt; He don't have pages in heaven. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So just looking at this the the the the the prophet Paul would tell us that uh uh uh your life is a is is a is a written episode. Amen. Read of all men. So he's giving on an an idea that you are a book. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will let us to know that when the lamb CAME TO CLAIM THE BOOK OF REDEMPTION, what was he claiming? He was claiming you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It was not a literal book. &gt;&gt; He was claiming you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is there is uh our natural part of life and there is our redeemed part of life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I was I was going to I was going to read something to you uh last week. I share with you uh uh I share with you a vision about those two fighters in New York back in 1962. what brother Brandham said he saw he saw them in the vision couple of weeks and then I also make mention to you I think I sent out that uh sister Annette like I said all my things are all in in uh I didn't put uh myself together like I supposed to this morning I know I have something to share that I was uh working on. So I thought that I will read that to you if you if you want to put that up for me. And uh I think I have a photo of uh the young lady also. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Watch this. and uh sitting in Colorado a few months ago in a little cabin. I went and and and said to my son, my wife and my daughter-in-law and then couple of hours something happened. I saw a young lady, a beautiful woman, and she was kind of uh thick lips, looked like they saw her somewhere, and she was trying to get to a doctor and she died. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and the spirit that was speaking to me said now they said that she committed suicide but she died with a heart attack. Praise the Lord. Now he's seen this in vision couple of weeks before uh Miriam Maro will die. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They will say she died. She committed suicide, but she died with a heart attack and said it's just a little before 4. The spirit that was speaking to me said it is just a little before 4, but you can say it was 4:00. She will die at 4:00. And the vision left me and I told them what what did that mean? I didn't know somebody is fixing to die. When we come out of the mountain two days later, that movie star was her name, Miriam Meron. She was kind of a strict read her story. She was an illegitimate child. This is this is the part of this whole thing that caught me and that's what I want to bring it to you. She was an illegitimate child. Her mother in an insign institution. Poor little girl probably had it high. Praise the Lord. And she's always hungering for something. I wish I could have got to her. I know what she needed. I knew what she needed. Yet she had joined churches and everything. But you see, it's just a ritualistic form. She needed the application of the blood. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. She needed the application of the blood. Now when we when we when we deal with uh the legion on the boxer. Now you have to realize that uh these things does not have any major uh uh spiritual application but it also help us to be able to realize that uh uh God servant you know the prophet of God had this he had this it was it was part of his life. He saw visions. It was just part of his life. And and it was not just only visions that was about the seals or vision about uh but there were just visions that was just breaking out. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ever say there he's in Colorado and they're there with his family uh up in the mountain and he's having vision about this young lady. Praise the Lord. that he will come and find out later when they come down from the mountain reading through the paper and uh can you can you also put uh the did I added the picture to there and there is there is another that's a picture there's another information that I added to it okay I I got I took this also from the web. Mary me official cause of death determined in 1962 was acute uh whatever name is that overdose from an excessive uh sedative of uh whatever name is there now. So ruled a probably suicide due to her ongoing struggle with depression and insomnia. Now that is the medical report. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who report will you believe? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. A prophet of God that is seeing her couple of weeks before she will die. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And is telling us by the vision they will say she committed suicide. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But she died of a heart attack. She had a high life. Her mother was in an in insane in institution. She was born in an illegitimate home. She had a very hard life. Praise the Lord. And I was talking to my wife this morning. We were just talking something and I said many times what we don't realize I also was sharing there with brother Daily yesterday he asked me to bring his greetings and we were just talking I was sharing some things with him many times we get to this age where we are now and we think that we are men and women we make our decision we make our choices and things that we do but what sometimes we don't realize is that there A lot of things that happen in our childhood &gt;&gt; that is embedded in your spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are a lot of things that you might be dealing with now and you keep asking why, how, why, and you cannot find an answer to. It is not a strange thing. It's not a curse that been thrown on you. There are a lot of things that we deal with in our spirit. in our childhood &gt;&gt; that is embedded in our spirit. &gt;&gt; A faction you. &gt;&gt; You were not born 35 years old. You were not born 28. You were not born whatever your age is now. You were born a day old and you grew. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You had a 12 months a cycle to have your first birthday. and you went through another cycle again to have another birthday. Sometimes those things are in family life. They are in the life of people that we deal with. They are in the life of of even sometimes our spouses because many times uh when we get married we we take this uh you know perfection mind to change the woman to be the kind of a woman I want to change the man that is 30 years old or 25 year or whatever her age was that you marry her that there are things that being in belly there whatever his age was that he got married there are things that been in belly there is there Let me tell you, giving your life to Jesus, what it does for you is that it takes the curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The curse is taken. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you deal with those things &gt;&gt; through your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You are saved. THERE IS NO CONDEMNATION TO THEM THAT ARE IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE CURSE IS TICKING. It's not THAT WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS, IT'S AN AUTOMATIC CHANGE. &gt;&gt; You are changed automatically. &gt;&gt; No, some of your habits &gt;&gt; and internal struggles &gt;&gt; are embedded in your spirit. &gt;&gt; They are embedded in your spirit. That's the reason why Paul says we are watched by the watching of the water. As we give ourself to the word of God and to prayers, the word wash us. HOW DO I WASH US? &gt;&gt; It exposes some of those things for you to see it &gt;&gt; for you to identify it. I'm struggling with this. I need help. &gt;&gt; But many times what happen? People are caught up in a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. The devil, you are a liar. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's always been a liar before you were born. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the GRACE OF GOD HAVE CALLED YOU TO PARTNERSHIP with him &gt;&gt; THAT AS GOD WILL REVEAL THESE THINGS TO YOU, he want you to be a partner, your work together to get it done, to get rid of it or to subdue it. &gt;&gt; There are some things that we will not be delivered from. Whether you like it or not, &gt;&gt; you'll be you will have to subdue it. &gt;&gt; You will always keep it under the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for you to do it, you have to identify it that I need help in this area. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There are some things that will go away. There are some things they will become a constant battle to you &gt;&gt; until you leave this life. Oh, brother say she needed something. She needed something. She know she needed something. Maybe she thought she could have got it by by by gaining fame, by going to Hollywood, by doing all of these things. Yet, it could not satisfy that thing within. and she died of a heart attack. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Ah, let me let me see if I can. So, I'm talking about Job here. Amen. I'm talking about Job. Where did I put this thing? Where did I put this thing? When I send this whole thing out there was I thought I attached this thing to it. Oh, God help me. Please don't leave me to myself. There was just there was something I wanted to just share with you and allow you to to go this morning. Job said, "I hope my words were written in the book." They were written in the book with an iron pen. Praise the Lord. and they were laying in a rock. We have to realize that uh every one of us, every one of us maybe I'm at los this morning. Okay, we'll get it to you. Maybe this not it's not uh uh I would tell people, you know, uh uh you get to to know people and work with people, you realize that we are all work in progress. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are all work in progress. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Especially for me, there's a whole lot of work the Lord have to do on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but uh I'm a special case. Praise the Lord. I'm a special case. Now, so when let's look at this and then uh and then leave you here this morning. And uh uh uh so you we we realize Job is at such a place where he's telling all of these things that is going on with him. Uh my even the kids see me like a stranger. I call to myself, he will not even answer me. What a condition for the man to be in a job. Job is the one using the language that it looks like I will escape with the skin of my teeth &gt;&gt; because of what he's going through. That is all his natural life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if and if you were in that time and in that particular time of Job life, if you have never read the rest of the story, you will think THAT THIS MAN LIFE will end LIKE THIS. THIS GUY is going to suffer and he's going to die like this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And everything that people have known about him will be wrapped up. And a man that lost ALL OF HIS CHILDREN, ALL HIS PROPERTY BURNED AND HE DIED OF AN ILLNESS. THE WHOLE LIFE STORY will be wrapped up in this if you did not read the rest of the story. Praise the Lord. EVEN JOB SAYING, "I KNOW MY REDEEMER WILL LIVE." HE'S JUST PROPHESYING. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT HE'S NOT SAYING IT WITH ASSURITYITY THAT I'M GOING TO GET HEALED. I WILL BE HEALED. He's not saying it. &gt;&gt; Inspiration struck his heart &gt;&gt; and he says, "I know my redeemer live." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is what faith does to the believer. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a line of inspiration that in THE MIDST OF YOUR STRUGGLE AND THINGS THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH, A LINE FROM THE scripture will struck your heart and you WILL SAY I KNOW MY GOD IS ABLE. &gt;&gt; HOW IT WILL HAPPEN, I DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; IT DOES NOT MEANS THAT WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU WILL NOT CRY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW it will happen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE SITUATION STILL BECOME FRUSTRATING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT GET A HOLD OF IT BUT YOU KNOW you know you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WORD HAS GIVEN YOU A PROMISE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now this is what I want to say to you this morning and then I can we can pray and let you go. As a redeemed child and daughter of God, &gt;&gt; you are carrying your book of life and your lamb book of life. &gt;&gt; You are carrying it. That lamb book of life is that redeemed portion. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, IT'S A SESSION IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's one book just like you are one. But there's a session in the book of life &gt;&gt; that is the lamb session &gt;&gt; and THE LAMB SESSION IS THE REDEEMED SESSION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHERE THE BLOOD IS APPLIED. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Don't wait to heaven &gt;&gt; to be looking for the book. &gt;&gt; You are that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a natural life that is REGISTERED FROM THE DAY YOU WERE BORN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The day you WENT TO SCHOOL, YOUR GRADE, YOUR PICTURE, EVERYTHING OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE is recorded. &gt;&gt; That's what that's why the prophet OF GOD SAYS THE DAY YOU WERE SAVED, THOSE INFORMATION was not transferred. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; to the lamb portion. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Those information were NOW TRANSFERRED WITH ME. NOW YOU YOU ARE LOOKING AT YOUR LIFE UNDER THE BLOCK. YOU ARE LOOKING AT YOUR LIFE WITH A DIFFERENT EYE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; YOU WENT THROUGH ALL OF THIS WHEN YOU WERE SMALL. YOU SUFFERED THIS. YOU DID THIS. YOU WERE SICK. YOU ALMOST DIED. BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE SAVED, YOU REALIZE THAT I COULDN'T HAVE DIED. GOD WAS KEEPING ME FOR THE PURPOSE. YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR PAST LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE GRACE THAT YOU HAVE NOW. &gt;&gt; YES. YES. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, GOD WROTE HIS WORD with an iron pen and he lay it in your life. &gt;&gt; He lay it in your life. &gt;&gt; He lay it in my life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you read Job 19 and read Psalm 22, you will see the same thing. DAVID IS SAYING, "ALL MY FAMILY HAVE LEFT ME. MY FRIENDS HAVE forsaken me." And and and and and brother Abraham SAY HE WAS HONOR INSPIRATION. He was speaking LIKE CHRIST. &gt;&gt; IT WAS CHRIST THAT WAS SPEAKING THROUGH HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the lamb came from the throne, John in a vision WAS SEEING THE LAMB COMING TO TAKE the book. ONE OF THE ELDERS SAW JOHN, DON'T CRY. THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH HAS PREVAILED. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John was crying. He wept his eyes. He's looking around to see a lion. He see A BLOODY LAMB. THAT IS IN A VISION. AND THE LAMB was coming to take the book unto himself. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And brother B will let us TO KNOW THAT THAT BOOK CONTAIN THE RECORD OF HIS PURCHASE POSSESSION. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHICH OF COURSE YOU ARE HIS PURCHASED POSSESSION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are his purchase possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are carrying a bunch of record. &gt;&gt; You are carrying a bunch of record AND SOME CAN LOOK INTO YOUR RECORD THAT YOU CARRY. LOOK AT your life and they can accuse you of all the this is what you used to be and this is where you used to be and this is where you used TO BE. NOW BECAUSE THOSE RECORD HAS BEEN transferred &gt;&gt; under the lamb portion of life, it does not bother you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because you see it different. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see it different. They say, "Yeah, well I used to see, you know, I was Yeah, I WAS THIS THAT. BUT BY HIS GRACE, &gt;&gt; AMEN." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; By his grace. &gt;&gt; Yes. All that my words were written. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were laying in a rock. You know rock always represent revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Having the revelation and understanding of the purpose, the purpose of your life, why God kept you all of these years. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Why you couldn't die at the time you came so close to death? Why? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is it all about? Oh, that my words were written and lame. John in Revelation says, "I see I see the book of life open and I see another book." And in the vision, the way you see things in vision sometimes is different from the way they happen naturally. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet will come and say, "Lord, it's not two different books. It's one book with two session." And that's what the believer's life is. We have one book with two sessions. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a natural session that runs our natural bloodline with natural things we deal with. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Natural habits, natural struggle. And then there is another session that is the redeemed session. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And just like the tree of life was not a natural tree of life, the tree of life was a man. And and and if you know also, you realize that books are made from trees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If the if the tree of life was a man, the book of life is a person. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The book of life is a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why Jesus will come in the temple. Take the book and open and read. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me for he have anointed me. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say and he closed the book and said to them this day, &gt;&gt; yes sir, &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled. What was he trying to tell them? &gt;&gt; I am this thing you are reading. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the possessor. I'm possessing it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You You only have the photo copy. The real copy is me &gt;&gt; this day. &gt;&gt; This scripture is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE SPEAKS ABOUT A BRIDE, THIS IS JUST A COPY. EVERYBODY CAN HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; You go to the Bible store, you can have it. &gt;&gt; But you can't purchase the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's a possessor of a character. &gt;&gt; That's what makes her a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO, WE REALIZE THAT THE SEALS WERE OPEN. The book is open. THE REVELATION OF GOD HAS BEEN REVEALED TO US for these words to leave the pages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And become a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the VERY SAME BOOK THAT NO MAN COULD LOOK UPON, NO MAN COULD TOUCH, NO MAN COULD READ. In Revelation CHAPTER 10, JOHN WAS GIVEN THE book and he was told to eat the book. Why? Why? Because he would become the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AND THAT BOOK WAS THE BOOK OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT A NATURAL BOOK, PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; You are the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READING FROM THE LAMB PORTION OF THE BOOK OR ARE YOU READING JUST THE book of life? ARE YOU INTRIGUED BY JUST YOUR NATURAL LIFE AND YOUR NATURAL H SUCCESS OR ARE YOU INTRIGUED BY WHAT GOD BY HIS grace is doing in your life? &gt;&gt; The bride is reading from the lamb portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's being intreated by what God is doing in her life every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not reading from the natural portion. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH WE LOVE IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE LIKE THE FAMILY WE ARE FROM, WE LIKE THE COUNTRY WE are from, we like to talk about it sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you reading from uh from your from your uh natural? You reading from your book of life or you reading from the lamb book of life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; You will see that theologians in studying the book of life and the lamb book of life, they came up with this. That's the reason why you find the words of Jesus in rare letters. You know why they did it? It was just the same thought of the lamb portion &gt;&gt; in the same book. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION is in the same book. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORDS OF JESUS, they put it in red. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THE SAME WAY IN THE BOOK OF LIFE IS ONE BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE &gt;&gt; IS in red. Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, that my words were written. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED HIS WORDS TO BE WRITTEN ON THE TABLE OF YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED YOU TO BECOME THE LITERAL EXPRESSION. WHEN THE BIBLE SAY FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORD, IT WOULD NOT JUST BE A VERSE IN THE BIBLE, BUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE expressed through your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't look at yourself and feel so sorry for yourself and just make yourself uh self-pitted and and no no the Bible say for God so loved the word. You are part of that word. You are you are part of the COSMOS THAT GOD LOVE THAT HE HE DRAWN TO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. All that my words were written in a book. &gt;&gt; One of these days all of these pages will be burned. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; WHEN EVEN SCIENCE, SCIENCE IS NOT EVEN DEPENDING on records anymore. They get everything in a cloud. Why would the God of heaven want to keep a book in heaven? WHY WOULD THE GOD OF HEAVEN WANT TO SAY THIS IS OKAY JUDGMENT DAY? Y'all bring me the book in your Gre God will be putting spit on your finger to look for your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. As as funny as it sound, it's is real. &gt;&gt; You are you are possessor of something that you must be proud of. &gt;&gt; You are possessor OF SOMETHING TO REALIZE THAT THE GRACE OF GOD HAS touched your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have your struggle &gt;&gt; and everything is all part of your book of life. &gt;&gt; The lamb book of life. The documents are being transferred little by little. I love it. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE, &gt;&gt; but I know I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE PORTION of my information has left my NATURAL BOOK OF LIFE IS NOW IN MY THE LIFE BOOK OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at my life through what God is doing. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now the way the economy is dictating to ME IS WHAT GOD PROMISED AND GAVE IT TO ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I said I was not going to keep you long. &gt;&gt; I must keep my word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I must keep my word. You been nice to me, I should also be nice to you. &gt;&gt; But that's that's that was what was on my mind. There's something I wanted to read to you. I don't know. I don't know what this guy is doing. I can't find it. I don't know where I laid it, guys. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I have I have it somewhere here. Praise the Lord. Oh, man. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. all the time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All the time. I I I I promise you I won't find it. As soon I get home will just be there. Something I just want to give myself slap on the cheek. So, what were you thinking? Praise the Lord. Amen. You know, Brother Brham talks right there where he talks about sometimes the whole church will be against you. your neighbors will be against. There's a beautiful way he said it. &gt;&gt; And if you look at that, you put it right in Job chapter 19, you realize it's the same thing. And and and and all of those things, it's God that condition. He's put you in that situation. You can't understand why. The people around you can't understand why. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is him bringing you to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's transferring your information &gt;&gt; and sometimes the the means of transferring is not easy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the digital age is making everything easy but the means of transferring is not easy. SOMETIMES OUR LIFE HAVE to go through some some tough part because God is transferring your information from the natural book of life &gt;&gt; to the lamb book of life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If we will LOOK AT THE TRIAL OF OUR faith that way &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE GOING THROUGH THINGS, if we will look at THE WAY THAT GOD IS USING THESE THINGS TO transfer my information, he's working his purpose THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY I CAN LOOK AT and says &gt;&gt; this is the work of God is marvelous in my eyes. P praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why sometime it's so hard. It's so difficult. They couldn't even believe that Paul was safe. GOD SPOKE TO ANANAS IN A VISION. GO DOWN THERE. THERE'S A MAN that is there. Poor Saul. Said, "What if it is a Saul that I know? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; They couldn't even BELIEVE BECAUSE WHAT THEY were reading his natural life. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE STILL READING IN HIS NATURAL BOOK OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; But God used the Damascus rod. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE USED THE PILLOW OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; BLIND HIM, THROW HIM TO THE GROUND, SEND HIM BLIND, GOD USED THAT to transfer his information. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHILE THEY WILL BE READING IN THE NATURAL BOOK, &gt;&gt; his information is now on the Lamb book of life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WOULD TAKE BARNABAS. BARNABAS IS THE ONE THAT observed Paul &gt;&gt; because Paul went back to Ania. That's where he was. And the Bible say he stayed there for many years. He will go to the temple be arguing WITH THE JEWS TELLING THEM ABOUT JESUS. IT TOOK BARNABAS TO REALIZE NO something has happened to this man. &gt;&gt; Yes. HE'S NOT THE SAME GUY THAT WAS KILLING THE CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; IT TOOK BARNABAS TO BRING HIM TO THE APOSTLES. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE PAUL SITTING IN THE MINISTER'S meeting &gt;&gt; of Acts chapter 15? &gt;&gt; Every one of them looking. What's going through their mind? He was there. He's the one that killed Stephen. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he gave the order. That's what going through their mind. &gt;&gt; And Paul is just sitting DOWN THERE &gt;&gt; IN HIMSELF. HE'S EVEN FEELING GUILTY &gt;&gt; THAT THIS VERY THING THAT I TRIED TO PERSECUTE. &gt;&gt; Let me s among these guys. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; BUT NOBODY WILL TAKE AWAY FROM him what happened to him on the ROAD OF DAMASCUS. &gt;&gt; NOBODY WILL EXPLAIN THAT BETTER TO PAUL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID, "WHO ART THOU, LORD?" &gt;&gt; BEING A STUDENT of the word, &gt;&gt; he will not call anything Lord. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT PAUL, BUT you cannot take that away from me. &gt;&gt; He said, I heard a voice. EVEN IF THE MAN AROUND ME SAID THEY NEVER HEARD IT, I heard a voice &gt;&gt; that said, Saul, Saul, why persecute thou me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why when we are dealing with things, don't be too personal about it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be too personal about it. Don't be too personal. Sometimes try learn to take the back seat and watch. &gt;&gt; As a child of God, you know that your life has been ordered from the Lord. &gt;&gt; The first step of the righteous is order. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes God will take the most bious experience in your life &gt;&gt; to take your information from the book of life to the lamp book of life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. MANY YEARS AFTER PETER WOULD TESTIFY, you read the book of Peter, he called the writing of Paul scriptures. That's what Peter said. HE SAID THE THINGS THAT PAUL WROTE ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND. &gt;&gt; He said those scriptures, he called it scriptures. And you can't call nothing scriptures until that which is given from the Lord. It is it is the mystery of this life people. &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God is the mystery of this life. It's the mystery of this life. Some of the things we go through that looks like they are unbearable but you still bearing it. &gt;&gt; If it will have killed you long time you are dead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It looks like it's unbearable but you are still bearing it. THE THING THAT MAKES IT PAINFUL IS BECAUSE you can't understand it. That's what make it painful. You can't understand why. That's what makes it painful. I would tell you that neither this pen or this paper knows what I want to write. &gt;&gt; The pen is doing the writing but it don't know because the intelligence is here. The intelligence is not yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE PAPER IS GOING TO RECEIVE THE WRITING but the paper do not know what will be written on it. The things that God is writing in our lives is from his intelligence. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. &gt;&gt; IT MUST GET ON THE PAPER FIRST BEFORE YOU SAY, "OH, &gt;&gt; oh yeah." Okay. &gt;&gt; King of the Rock. Okay. Broad voice. Okay. Okay. Unless it get on the paper. I can't give you an empty paper and tell me why am I going to write? &gt;&gt; You will never know. You will never know. &gt;&gt; God has predestinated us for this hour. Remember, there's a prophecy that you will not fail. There's a people that is that is that is that's been brought up under the word of God and know the mind of God. She know the scripture. She just don't know BIBLE VERSES. &gt;&gt; KNOWING BIBLE VERSES IS DIFFERENT FROM KNOWING the scripture. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS TOLD THE PHARISEES, YOU DO BECAUSE YOU DON'T know the scriptures. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS SPEAKS, HE SAYS, "STUDY THE SCRIPTURES." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Study Bible verses." He says, "Study the scriptures, for in them you have eternal life." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A BRIDE that is raising in his hour. As a PEOPLE THAT GOD IS raising in this hour, people might speak against their messenger, speak against their manner of belief and speak against THEIR LIFE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. &gt;&gt; But God said, "Pick up your &gt;&gt; pen &gt;&gt; and write." &gt;&gt; And he's using your life, &gt;&gt; to write those final voices. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's your purpose in this age. &gt;&gt; That's your purpose in this age. &gt;&gt; Oh, may God give us grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be able to understand these things. &gt;&gt; May he give us grace &gt;&gt; to be able to rise to the occasion. &gt;&gt; RISE TO THE OCCASION. When I read that, I think a couple of days ago, it really broke my heart. Really broke my heart. Just a young lady born in an home. Does she really know her father? &gt;&gt; Was the father there to really hold her and give her the a father and daughter time? She never really had that thing. So, so she she she want to make herself a model. She want to put herself out there to be accepted &gt;&gt; when there should be a daddy whom to make her feel accepted. &gt;&gt; It It really broke my heart. It really broke my heart. And sometimes those things we don't understand it. Amen. We don't understand it. But there are a lot of things like I said from your childhood that is embedded in your spirit. Your spirit is pregnant with those things. They are in your subconscious. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes they play out when you don't expect them to play out. Sometime it surprise you. Sometime it surprise people around you. Sometime you really don't mean it. &gt;&gt; But it's something you've been carrying so long. So long. That's the reason why sometimes we must we must we must have patient with ourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime just just look in the mirror and give yourself some grace. Man, you're looking good. &gt;&gt; Just give yourself some grace. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just look in the mirror and say, turn around, you're looking good, man. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can do it. &gt;&gt; Give yourself some grace. Give yourself some grace because sometimes you don't know it is there. None of us in this building is free from it. Unless you were not born of a woman. &gt;&gt; If you were born of a woman, you you're going through there &gt;&gt; things from your childhood. A prophet of God on a vision, he will grab people on a vision that you are nervous. You have struggled with nervousness because when you were a child, a dog make you afraid. &gt;&gt; So you struggle with that all through your life. It's been there. &gt;&gt; And it started from there's a seed time. It was sold as a seed in your spirit &gt;&gt; and you and you say you talk to your I mean why other people are so free to talk and me I'm not free to talk and you ask yourself why I can do it why other people are praise the lord &gt;&gt; but yeah I I just wanted to tell you this this uh today that be more be attracted to the lamb book of life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because with all the things that have happened in your life, if you read it from the your natural book of life, you will not understand it. &gt;&gt; It will only make sense to you if you read the one that has been transferred. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason WHY HEBREWS CHAPTER 11, I have to close this thing because until a preacher close his Bible, he keeps talking. Hebrew Hebrews chapter 11, PAUL WILL TALK about Noah by faith. Do you think that no one knew that what he was doing he was doing it by faith? &gt;&gt; No. He was nervous in his day. He was nervous. How can he come UP WITH THIS IDEA TO BUILD A BOAT WHEN HE HAD NEVER SEEN a rain? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was nervous. &gt;&gt; BEING A MAN OF LIKE PASSION, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT he was going through. &gt;&gt; Yes. to believe something that none of your NEIGHBORS BELIEVE. SOMETHING THAT JUST MAKE YOU STRANGE, &gt;&gt; telling them that there's going to be a rain. God sent us a prophet. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Paul said, "By faith, Noah. By faith, Abraham." &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY FAITH ISAAC. YES. YES. &gt;&gt; And what brother Brandon was saying is when God comparted their record, he never put none of their mistakes in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it CAME FROM THEIR NATURAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; HEBREW CHAPTER 11 WAS A PORTION OF THE BOOK OF THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE, THE LAMB RECORD. &gt;&gt; THE WAY GOD SAW THOSE MEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; THEY SAW THEMSEL LIKE FAILURE LIKE MEN LIKE GIDEON. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A FRIEND. HE WAS NEVER HE WAS SCARED. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID, "YOU ARE A MIGHTY MAN." BECAUSE &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A MIGHTY MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Say mighty. I can't even see muscle. &gt;&gt; He couldn't see muscle. But God was not looking for muscle. &gt;&gt; God was looking for a deposit character. Yes. &gt;&gt; A deposit virtue &gt;&gt; that he deposited in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; IF GOD DIDN'T SEE YOU AS SOMEBODY THAT CAN RISE TO THE OCCASION of the message of the hour, he will never bring it your way. &gt;&gt; HE BROUGHT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR YOUR WAY BECAUSE HE KNOW THERE'S A DEPOSIT IN YOU &gt;&gt; that can rise to the occasion. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You just need to COME IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT. &gt;&gt; YOU JUST NEED TO BE UNDER THE RIGHT WORD. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just need to get away from legalistic. KEEP GET YOUR EYES OUT OF THE NATURAL BOOK OF LIFE AND LOOK AT the the the the redeemed BOOK OF LIFE. WHAT THE GRACE of God is DOING IN YOUR LIFE. HOW FAR HE'S BRINGING YOU. HOW HE'S HELPING YOU EVERY DAY. It makes you to be grateful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It makes you to be thankful. &gt;&gt; It makes you to say, LORD, IF THERE IS SOMEBODY YOU CAN SEND, send me. &gt;&gt; You are not looking at your natural ability. You are looking at the grace that have brought you this fire. And the grace that have brought you this fire will take you in rapture. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. Musicians, you can come. &gt;&gt; Oh, that my words were written. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; All that my words were written. &gt;&gt; Oh man. Glory be to God. Glory be to God.

You know the song of Moses who is like unto day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's let's sing the song of Moses if you want to think about it. Who is like unto I think we should have the words.

If science has got to the place where they are putting all the informations in the cloud and what is almighty God doing with a literal book there's no literal book in heaven you are that book praise the Lord amen for this age you want to write it on your heart &gt;&gt; you want to write it in your life &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you are not thinking about certain things and God will just give you an inspiration. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To do or to say something you can say to comfort somebody. Something you can do to help them out. He's just writing &gt;&gt; that thing on your heart. Prophet would say it just dropped them. That's what brother Brandon would say. It just dropped them. Jesus would say flesh and blood has not given it to you. &gt;&gt; But my father just wrote that on your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have to be very conscious people. &gt;&gt; We cannot live a careless life. &gt;&gt; Neither we cannot live a selfish life. &gt;&gt; No, life involves about your surrounding where you find yourself in every given moment. You can't live a selfish life. We can't live a careless life. You have to be very sensitive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And always ask yourself, what would Jesus want me to do? What would the Lord want me do in this situation? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we are just so full of ourself. If it is me, no, I will not do it. If it is me, no I would not do it. Why if you were dead, then it would there would be nothing about. If it is you, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The people around you that God placed around you, your family, loved ones, people you work with, friends, whatever it is, you have to realize if I drop dead this morning, by the grace of God, I believe this church will continue. &gt;&gt; I never one day in my heart that the existence of this church is because I'm here. No, &gt;&gt; the existence of this church is because there is a living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a living God. &gt;&gt; And you have to think about that. If you drop there, the people around you, they will survive. they will survive &gt;&gt; because their existence is because there is a God. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; When we start to tie ourself to that place that people around us or things around us cannot survive, you're making yourself God. You are putting yourself in the seat of God. And now you want to be worshiped. And now you want to be You have to be careful. We're not called to a careless life. &gt;&gt; We are not called to a selfish life. &gt;&gt; Yes. You are carrying a book. But Paul says you are a written episode. And God has used his iron pen to write some things in your life. And he makes you a steiver. You are a manager of the information of grace that God has given to you. &gt;&gt; That is your vocation. &gt;&gt; That is your divine calling. How to manage this grace that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the thing that caught God's heart when Solomon said, "God, your people are great people. Teach me, give me a heart to know how to go in and come out." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It was that prayer OF SOLOMON, THE DESIRE in his heart. That night, God visited him in a dream. He said because you have not asked for riches, you have not asked for I will give you wisdom. Paul says you are stewards of the mysteries of God. The thing that looks like there's a mystery about your life, it was not about you. It was about God. God has called you into partnership. He has called us into partnership for us to be able to manage there. I think from F to glory. &gt;&gt; You ask me what I'm happy, I'll tell you why. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's sing. So I just tell you why. Because my saints are gone. And when I leave first, who ask me where they are, I say my saints I go. They are on the block of the cross of Calvary.

Oh blood on the cross of Calvary as far removed from down. Oh God forgetfulness from me. Praise God. My s when Satan comes to tempt me and try to make me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say my saints are you devil. You got me into trouble. But Jesus brought me out. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm my saint. Oh, they are hung on the cross of Calvary. As far remove as darkness is from. Oh, the seed of God forgetfulness for me.

As I remove as darkness from down in the se forgetfulness for me. Praise God. My saint &gt;&gt; and we say Jesus took my burden and rolled and made the sea. &gt;&gt; He rolled them in. Let's let's bow our heads and say amen because I can go on and on and on and I will not be fair to you. Let's pray together.
