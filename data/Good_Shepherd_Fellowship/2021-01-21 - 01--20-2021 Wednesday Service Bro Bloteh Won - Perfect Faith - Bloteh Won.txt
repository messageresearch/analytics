gracious the lord is mindful praise the lord psalm chapter 55 we would like to read that tonight psalm chapter 55 praise the lord psalm chapter 55 amen let's read from verse one give ears to my prayer o god and hide not that self from my supplication praise the lord i believe you you feel like that amen i believe that's how you feel in your heart that god will not hide himself from our prayers attend unto me and hear me i moan in mind complain and make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for the cast iniquity department in in wrath they hit me my soul my heart a soul pain within me and the terror of death are falling upon me fearfulness and trembling i come upon me in horror have overwhelming praise the lord and i said oh dad i had a wings like a dove amen do you feel feel like that tonight let's just read that verse six together then and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then i will fly away and be at rest amen let us pray heavenly father lord jesus we just want to ask blessing upon the portion of your word the law taketh god as a prayer from our hearts lord that we wish we had wings like dove to be able to fly away from the terror of the enemy in whichever way law that he's oppressing our mind and pressing our life for god may your spirit be able to lift us up tonight because we know that father don't represent the holy ghost and may he fly in our midst tonight lord and be able to lift us up we love you and we appreciate you father in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen amen amen praise the lord sister grace god bless you it's good to have sister grace with us that brother ariel's uh older sister his mother actually an absent of his mom she's the one in church so it's good it's good to have her have her with us tonight amen so he's in all of his best behavior amen but i want to share something with you before the night uh cover us tonight or before the time leave us we were speaking something after the prayer meeting last wednesday and we we just want to cover a few things and uh sister fed you if you would just help us we'll go right over to what we have as a note i want to share something with you to build up to something and i hope that the lord can be able to help us to do that tonight amen so we will start from perfect faith let's just take uh perfect faith now faith is based on forgiveness praise the lord now faith is based on forgiveness amen faith is based on forgiveness then and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us amen we had a time to speak on this couple of months back apostolic time moving among us that that's what we are hungering that's what the church is hungering that's the reason why we've been taking ourselves through these uh wednesday night prayer meeting uh wednesday night is is uh it's a regular service regular preaching service but we've been trying to to to grease our praying wheels amen to grease our praying wheels because we are looking to see apostolic time among us that's what we are we are hungering it just laying right at the door see but we want to see more of it amen we wanted such a flaw it will be a help to us flow out to others it's flowing from us to others praise the lord now pay attention to these few other words i will read remember jesus as we are in the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sinful and we know that's what also the holy ghost is giving for amen is for you to be a blessing to others that's what it was sinful and you think sometimes why would a man that was so full of power like him will have to even be sick praise the lord amen yes sir that i read in some books some word word when he raised raise up that boy the widow's son from then i believe the prince of the house of david and he sat on the rock and groaned with a headache see he bought our infirmities praise the lord that's what the scripture says the scriptures say he bought our infirmities so uh the the writer on the inspiration was taking this scripture that jesus bore our infirmities and what infirmities is infirmities is sickness so if he brought our infirmities wish me he was sick are we together it's a it's a kind of a hard thought the first time i read that it troubled me a little bit jesus sake that he got a headache but you have to remember that the bible says in the book of hebrew that he was tested tempted everywhere for him to be the high priest that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities he tasted everything he became sinner for us yet he committed no sin praise the lord amen he became sinner for us he took our sin upon him and when he when he bought our infringements he became sick he got tired he fell hungry and all of that but thinking about that now there's a place that we want to travel tonight he bought our infinity bad means to pack them and he had all things like we have he has sickness he had temptation he had trouble he had frustration just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator praise the lord so he had to partake the husband man of the fruit before before he would know amen now so just just take that uh and and and what i want to what i'm i'm getting to in here is that this is the man that rolls lazarus from the grave praise the lord amen and just like brother branham referred to yet is the other like someone said he never went to no funeral service because when he showed up the dead came back to life praise the lord amen when he showed up the death came back to life now so but because it was prophesied uh by god through the prophet isaiah and many other prophets in the old testament that jesus would come this way amen jehovah god that the intent of god would come and identify himself with us coming by the way that we all were born he came through nine month period in the womb so he knows what it is when a woman is with child praise the lord i mean he could have stepped right down from the corridor of heaven we know he did it one time when he came to abraham he took a dust and he blew a body and stepped in it and he visited he could have done the same but for him to be able to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he had to come by the way of a cell and the blood amen praise the lord so he knows exactly what you feel when i mean every every form of life just from the warm to the grave amen like i said there is no excuse praise the lord that's our high priest but think about it this way because we want to travel down here let's take the next one on on the message united time and sign amen speaking of tension i was praying about it this morning what would you do if you didn't have tension just think about it tension is part of living that kind of encouragement when i thought of death if you had no tension you'd be like a red dog just like the little ones that the babies play with you wouldn't have no feeling that there'd be nothing you could work on you won't you have nothing to work on in your life if you did not have no attention if you didn't have no pressure if there was nothing bothering you there would be you'll have no sense of focus amen like a husband and a wife you know exactly what it is you know where we're going with this one maybe if you want to do something and they are trying to work together especially christians and when you come together and find and what she have done and and what we're trying to keep our mind on your extension see the attention really bring you closer together praise the lord and i believe that's the reason why god allowed us to go through different tension is to bring us closer to him amen is for us to be able to lift up our heads and look up because our redemption drawer at night and and somebody tells you that as we just going on here uh i want to get to a place here amen praise the lord somebody tells you just say just think about things of the little wife that went uh on a lot of tension when you washing so good or the husband when on some tension when when you washing so good that's when it's all forgiving now tie this to the first quote that we read amen that faith is based on forgiveness praise the lord forgiveness is the foundation of faith jesus said when you stand praying forgive that the heavenly father will forgive you so forgiveness is the foundation of faith now so brother branham yet is now bringing our our our life our personal life whether it is family life or whether it is uh individual life he's saying when we go through tension and sometimes when we put people through tension and we think about a sacrifice that someone has made we think about well it's because of me this person has to go through this thing he says a medal your heart amen so when it comes when it comes time where you have to go through things for that person you remember that that person also made some sacrifice that person went through tension he says a create a room for forgiveness sometimes when you have bitter disagreement with somebody it could be your brother sister it could be husband or wife it could be a friend and and you just think about it you just try to fish out in your mind that this person went through this for me i remember i remember branham says that in great commission he said you can never bring any matter before god in prayer and hold anything against him praise the lord now so you just think about that he says it create a room that's when all is forgiving look how you feel about them and he says and and and and just think of feelings what if you did that you didn't have any feelings you know science also proved this i was going to i'm going to read some things to you uh talking on the on the message i'm kind of for working on uh timing the beast science proof that the constant pains we feel in our body adjust our mind to deal with them praise the lord amen and and that is the reason why uh uh the doctors will now want you to be on uh excessive pain pills because what what happened is that when your body is experiencing pain your mind is conditioning the cells of your body to the level of pain now if if a person is on excessive pain pills what happened is that your mind is deceived there is pain in your body but your mind does not know about it because the pain pill is suppressing it so when the pain wells out and then your body starts to feed pain then the mind says where did it came from where you know then the mind starts to stick out because if i knock my hand against the wall the pain i'm feeling goes straight to my mind the mind knows that it's from the fingers the pain came from my left fingers that are just not on the wall so it adjust my body to it it's it's like it's like a shock absorber it tried to absorb the pain and spray it out through my body praise the lord amen now so if we did not have no pain what if you didn't have any feelings no pain or nothing what if there was no pain at all you did have no feelings at all and if you had no feelings then one of your senses would be gone praise the lord amen now you see those are some of uh uh some of the reason like we spoke on the four uh uh the four anointing of healing you know what we have uh the ego anointing which is divine healing which is miracle you know that you are pray for and the sickness gone away fly like an eagle amen and then you have the man's anointing which is the doctors the doctors are honored the man's anointing with prescription and and therapy and different things that is all under the mains anointing for healing because brother branham says good doctors are ordained of god amen medical science is not it's not of the devil it's not of the devil medical science is of god brother branham prayed many times that god would give doctors wisdom the reason is because not everyone have faith to accept their healing the people in the world don't have faith to accept their healing and because they are god's creature and god loved them and cared for them he had to create an avenue to be able to deal with them amen that's why he blessed medical science so it will be a blind faith for you to despise medical science are we together he says here now he says if we didn't have no pain no feelings who lost one of our sins and everything just all right he says god just gave us grace to stand up to it that's the thing if i just stand up with that grace and stand dead and say we know that when this life is over there's you know uh the great one on the other side and you think about it there are many many wonderful christians i mean people that have faith people that really have faith are people that can still raise their hands with pains in their body and say thank you jesus that's it takes faith for you to do that and many of god's children are honored the ox anointing they believe in divine healing they are believing god for their healing but their body is still sick there are many christians that have cancer there are many christians that have and they have illness it does not have anything to do with their faith does not do not judge a person because of their sickness and say they don't have faith you will be wrong because just as how god allowed the saints under the dark age to go to the fire to be burned for women to be burned to the sick and they will be burning and praising god they will honor an anointing to bear the terror of rome because of the gospel that is the same anointing that god would keep a a a a young believer or an elderly believer that is that is suffering illness in their body but that illness have not destroyed their faith to believe god they still believe in god amen whether in this life or in the other life that no healing is going to come if it does not come in this life when they step on the other side they will be in a brand new body for the matter of fact death is a healing to the believer a miracle praise the lord because as soon as death struck you step into a body where you never feel pain anymore amen so no matter what we are going through brother branham says all we need is just grace to stand up to it because we know on the other side it's going to be better praise the lord we just need grace to stand up to it stand up toe to toe to the devil don't let him to boo you just stand up to it praise the lord god gave us grace to stand up he says if if i just stand up wave that grace and stand there and say we know that when this life is over the great one is on the other side where we are looking to go and remember remember that all these things that's tension amen all these things sickness pain frustration they are all tension it's it's a kind of a shock to to the hemony you know they're setting pressure on us and we start to think why me why this you know in all of that it's just tension but the the major purpose of attention is to turn our attention to god amen praise the lord let's take another one here he says you are attention when you become a christian you have just added attention to your natural life tension praise the lord amen because first you have to be with nature you have to deal with family members and all the people but now you also have to deal with spiritual weakness in high places so you have just had attention when you become a christian because you you you was kind of stop go happy lucky happy go lucky whatever it was not caring what you did but when you have become a real christian every moment you are wondering am i pleasing my lord praise the lord what if i could hear from him i was reading i was reading the book and this old scene he was going through something i mean he was i mean he was it was he was just going through tough time of life so he went to pray and and he was asking god and said he said lord if i can just hear from you if you can just speak to me if you can just speak to my heart lord he says i know everything will be okay praise the lord then the voice spoke to his heart and said if i would have spoke to you and you believe that everything will be okay just believe that everything will be okay amen he said lord if you speak to me if you just give me a word i know that everything will be okay amen now if you are desiring a word from the lord to know that everything will be okay just believe that everything will be okay praise the lord and he got up from praying and he went believing that everything would be okay glory be to god so we get under that pressure lord am i pleasing the lord what if it puts your own attention it puts you on god that makes you what you are so after all tension is a blessing it's just the way you are looking at it the way you are looking at it but it's a blessing amen because it's keeping you on guide praise the lord i want to get something here before i i lost my time i'm almost losing my time here no matter how tame you slice anything it got two sides to it praise the lord so you want to see both sides you want to look at both sides what is tension if if i could could have been born without tension well if i wouldn't have had this tension i wouldn't have been what i am i wouldn't have been the christian perhaps if it was this tension that drove me into jesus jesus christ see so is being a blessing thing to me so paul as paul said when he had tension or something another and he consulted the law to take it away three times the law said to paul my grace is sufficient amen he said then i will glory in my infirmities then when i'm weak i'm strong as long as long as it's the weight of god all right now pay attention here now we we're going to we we're going to grab something here that i want to drive you into something else now i consulted him one time but i'm talking about himself now so pay attention i consulted him one time when it used to bother me so bad it scared me brother branham has something in his life that used to bother him so bad it used to scare him praise the lord many you know about it but you maybe you didn't know it like the way i'm bringing it to you he says i consulted him one time when i used when he used to bother me so bad it scared me and he told me about eight or ten years ago he said it it it will never scare you again now it will never scare you again it's different from it has left you it's two different things amen you dealing with something is there but you know that every time the lord allowed this thing to happen it brings me close to him it brings me on my knees praise the lord they are certain things that scares us a a question is a question your walk with god a question whether you have the holy ghost a question whether you will make it in the rapture you are so scared when those things are happening praise the lord but there is a period of time where god deals with you so personally that he take the scarecrow away you still feel the pain but you are not scared by it praise the lord amen devil if this didn't kill me in a twinkling of an hour i'll be before my maker praise the lord it does not scare you let's go ahead a little bit remember it's a prayer meeting amen and he told me about eight ten years ago he said it will never scare you again and it wouldn't and it never has did it so no sir don't worry about it i just feel it it says i feed it but i know it's there but i just go on cars it don't scare me no more so i'm thankful for that do you see what an embarrassment to the devil he's trying to peek at you and you just look at him you just look at him praise the lord and you just ignore him glory be to god i mean father for the man for the mortal to be going through something that is very embarrassing something that is very painful and and to come to the place to come to the place where you take that as part of your life experience you are not using it as a walking stick of excuse praise the lord you are not going everywhere and telling people you know it's because this thing is happening to me you are not making a poor excuse about it praise the lord now let me come to the to the picture here just with this and there are a few things that we read tonight and it's it's it's a little bit uh we don't have time to be able to bring everything together but i'll give you the picture here you'll be able to grab it in a message on the wings of a snow white dog brother branham talks about since he's been a child since he was a child every seven years now picking up from sunday now every seven years we know there are major changes that take place in the human body and every seven years he had something that would come around you know the story about brother branham's stomach problem where he ate food and and he vomited praise the lord and uh some diagnosis was it was it was it was awesome and and you know and some said it was it was this but in the message on the wings of a snow white dog brother branham brought up now what brother branham was talking about here that it has bothered him but it don't scare him anymore it was that stomach problem praise the lord it was that stomach problem that he had in the message in the wings of the snow white door brother branham talks about where he was in the prayer line he said brother jack morgan you remember i was in the prayer line my stomach was hurting me but here is a man with cancer that came before me and i was praying for that man with my stomach aching me and god healed the man praise the lord i know i've given you a homework praise the lord now so he talks about that from paragraph 137 he said i've been a neurotic all of my life because this thing has bothered me now when brother branham was was was just a child because vision was part of his life he had a vision of a squirrel sprinking at him and entering his mouth and that was what caused that problem so it was not actually awesome it was an evil spirit praise the lord amen but if you bring it in context of the word that we have just read the scripture says he bowed our infirmity yes a man that was born right from his birth with a divine gift of praying for the sake but in the way that god would keep him honor that sign of that divine gift was to put infirmities in his body praise the lord brother baruch said that's the reason why eliza the couples make and demise they all went away from paul because with such a such administrator poor heart yeah he had an eyes problem he always talked about his eyes bothering him and we know it came from the pillar of fire what god would choose to call a man by a divine calling but yet it will leave as god in his life it will leave such as god in his life that would bother him and humble him all the days of his life praise the lord the lord knows all about it jesus knows all about it he knows what you are going through he knows the battles you are fighting praise the lord we are fighting the same enemy it's just that we are in different corners praise the lord amen glory be to god so don't think your battle is more tougher than mine praise the lord the lord trusted you so he put you in that corner and he put me on this side praise the lord to keep the enemy away so on the wings of a snow while dawg brother branham actually preached that message because he had just got a visitation from the lord he had just got a visitation from the law i'll give you a little more of the picture brother i'm talking about uh uh uh adolf what a wonderful bird we realized that right from genesis god associated a dove wave redemption praise the lord when allah came to rest he uh sent out a raven and the raven went and saw dead cackles all over and started eating their body forget to come back to noah a little noah sent out a dog but you see the thing about it there is that those are born with their mate dopes are born with their mate praise the lord amen and when the mate dies the dove do not meet again they don't mate again praise the lord so when when noah sent out the dolph definitely would have to come back because the myth was in act praise the lord amen they have to be too brother amen maybe the crow can go and live on their carcass but dove will not do that so he got a leaf and he came back and witnessed to noah that the land was ready to be inhabited are we together now so we see here that uh uh uh genesis chapter 15 when when god was about to make uncovering with abraham a dove was also in the covenant two doves and that was the only animal could never be caught in the sacrifice they were kept as a whole because they represented the dual covenant dove always was in peace offering and the reason why the turtle dove was not caught because the same god that heals your body is the same god that saved your soul it's a doer coveting amen that's what is called the do what coveted verb adam says it's a do a covenant it's the same word sozo he talks about the sickest body that i know is the church amen he says a man can be prayed for he would get healed and get sick again but when god bring healing to your soul it's the same thing praise the lord amen that's the reason why divine healing was was debate for the saving of the soul because they are they are they both of them are in the same coveted the healer and the save the the savior they were all that's the reason why the turtle dove was never caught in in the sacrifice it was always put there as a whole and uh over over in leviticus it was used for purification when a woman will have to come back to the to the tabernacle you know she has to present a a total dog it was used for purification it was the same it was just a special kind of a bird a special kind of a bird so tied to redemption in many ways now so you realize that in that in that message you go back and listen to it you hear him uh uh making a tear stencil to the sun on the wings of a snow white dog though i have suffered in many a way brother branham himself wrote that stencil and he was witnessing to his to his stomach problem because he had just got a visitation from the lord in arizona so when he came over to to to to sweep paul to preach uh for for for brother jack more he decided to preach on the wings of a snow while but actually what he was doing is that he was testifying of what has happened to him are we together amen and and and he bear this you you hear you hear about brother branham talking about you know uh going to ask his pastor rod davis to pray for him to anoint him with oil and he comes home and his mom with his corn bread and beans and he will eat it he will put his mouth into his mouth because the food is trying to come out it was just a horrible thing and he lived with that all of his life but yet he was praying for the sake he lived with that all of his life so he had this very funny funny vision at the time he said he didn't even know what what a vision was uh and he just saw this thinking and uh of this of this funny looking creature like a skull sprinting on him and going straight in his mouth and since that time he had a problem in his stomach and he bear this thing but you think about it god we know that paul talks about the gift of healing in the book of corinthians but the gift that came to us through malachi 4 amen they gave of discerning the thoughts it was not just to heal us of our sickness but to tell us how this thing begin in your life verbatim by vision he will goes back in the life of a woman when you were a child he says a dog scare you and since that time you became so nervous that thing affected your young spirit and it have troubled you all of your life that was a kind of a divine gift that he had he could go back into people life and tell them about things about their whole life the beginning of their illness what caused their illness and all of that it was god's grace bringing us to an understanding because because the thing that defeat the enemy just like the bible says my people perish because of the lack of wisdom if god gives you an understanding why you are going through what you are going through is enough to give you faith to go through it the rest of your life but if you don't know why that's when you ask all the questions but if god comes and tell you you were born for this purpose i ordained you for this purpose look this is how it's happening and this is how it's going to end that's faith you can fight against that's the reason why god has to bring a gift of wisdom a gift of knowledge behind the gift of divine healing because i mean the gift of divine healing was already there but it was just like an aim and miss a person come you lay your hands upon them and you pray for them by faith and as soon as they leave the building starts to feel chill the devil kicks their mind that man just deceive you they start to nurse doubt in their mind and the sickness comes back but he tells you and says when you are prayed for you go back and feel worse he says it's just like a dead body when the life leaves the body it swears off but there is no life in it he says so when you go back you will feel worse but that sickness is gone just keep praising god what was that that was wisdom that was knowledge to be able to help the children of god hold to their healing because people think healing is is a magical work no healing is a process for you to enjoy your healing you have to fight for it you have to hold to it because healing is part of our inheritance in every inheritance of god's people they fight for it but with such a gift he had in his life he had this horrible problem of his stomach he came over to mayo clinic here in rochester there's zombie hen and did everything try to find out what was it they go there they couldn't see nothing like a sword in his stomach many doctors told him we can do nothing for you i mean you're going to be like this until you die brother branham headed as a secret he had it as a secret going seven times around the world praying for sick people but yet he had an infirmity that was bothering him he said oh if i could just see that he said if i could just see that he says i told my wife if i could just see that see that vision again he says at the time i didn't know it was a vision because i was just a small boy he said if i could just see it he was just longing to say he wanted to understand what was that paul says our glory in my infirmities fanny crosby she sank a song in the cross be my glory forever till my rapture soul she says in the cross in my affliction in my infirmities in my suffering will be my glory i will not glory when i'm on the horse stop our glory because god has found favor with me that he had trusted me with something that would bring glory to him praise the lord amen so brother brandon one time he was praying about it crying to god and really praying about it he says and and uh and and he heard and says he says don't worry it's just six inches long he says what does that mean just six inches long praise the lord amen i noticed about timing i was gonna let you go home glory be to god he said he heard it was just six inches long he says what is that it says one time he came back from the field and his mother told him belly i had a dream i dreamed about you and the mother narrated the dream to him and there were six dolph in her dream and he was wondering what does that mean i'm praying about this thing you know in a way that brother branham was built with his gift and his nature things of nature speaks to him greatly when things happen in nature he speaks to him they grab his attention he pay attention to it and he starts to think it's just six inches long would that be six is the number of man is that what it is he says and yes mama having a dream and dreaming about sick cis dolph flying my way praise the lord and he's thinking about all of this saying lord what is this and he's out on the field and he's doing what he's doing glory be to god and just before he preached that message on the wings of a snow white dog he was there there over there in arizona up on the mountain you know and then you just think about it this this was almost about you know about 40 years all of his life and while he was out there he broke into a vision and he saw the same horrible little scholar this time when the sorrow flew his way it missed him and he said he dropped her from the bed you know it was it was very very it was very very amazing i heard branham saying he says i woke up from the bed and i looked on the other two in bed i looked at my wife i said this is a vision then he woke up he says meet up wake up do you remember the vision i told you about a horrible scar i just had that vision and he missed me he said i saw the same horrible scary but this time it missed me does that mean it's a sign i would be well that was the reason why he preached that message and then when he went on the mountain to pray after that vision then he saw a lonely white dog flying his way that he counted as the servant of praise the lord so with that confirmation you hear him over and over on the tape i'm referring to the tape because i want you to listen to it you hear him over and over on the tape he says i know i will be well now what am i driving to with all of this tension is a blessing praise the lord tension is a blessing when you attain for the right thing amen but you think about it malachi 4 what uh uh this day this scripture is fulfilled he says the son of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings he says there will be healing campaign going around the world and uh you know and and all of that god gave such a great gift there is no pentecostal preachers even to the people that don't love brother branham teaching there is no question about the gift that he had they will not take the preaching of the word they will not want to do anything with the seals they will not want to do anything with the divine interpretation that he brought upon the scriptures but when it came to his gift praise the lord because there were many men in uh uh uh uh alan jack called and and and and uh tommy osborne and all of those men they were on the field there were healing campaigns all over praise the lord but there was now one have such a gift like that because it's god that gives gifts praise the lord amen so what am i saying to you tonight we talk about in the broadband you listen to the tape you're listening to the healing you're listening to the discernment and sometimes people get carried away and want to make brother brandon more than what he was let me tell you many of us we just knew brother branham from the tapes it take the grace of god for you to be able to pick up some of these things that was in his natural life we just know him from the tape we know him from the seals we know him from the church ages barbara says the verb says this but the same man i was preaching there brother never had a queen-sized bear he and his wife was sleeping on twin bed twin twin bed the bed you get for your children twin bed brother bam says that one of the reasons why he was always in visions and his wife didn't want it to bother him so he had to sleep aside because she knew when he was in a vision he never had an office for himself he had to use the old trailer but this was a ministry that gave it all for you and myself to be to where we are for us to have young people that love god that want the holy ghost god has to use a man as a forerunner to open this channel for us to save us from some of the horrible lives that we would have had bring order of the preaching of the word he was a man that bold infirmities that's what brother bram says you have to know what people going through you have to step in their shoes god designed it that way for his ministry to be productive he knew what pain was he knew what suffering was um praise the lord amen but you see that just like i said last wednesday let me close this thing up because i keep looking at things and i keep going just like i said last wednesday we were talking about john bapti the first forerunner in his ministry how he was going to bring the low places hard and the high places he's going to bring down in the crooked places and the rough places those are the four direction in john the baptist ministry to prepare the way he was to prepare the way for the lord and his own bulldozer that he was coming with it was going to go north south east and west praise the lord enough is the high places he going to bring it down load south is the low places you're going to bring it up high east is the crooked places praise the lord and those are some other things that we were caught in our nature was caught in it some people had rough lives some people i mean i mean they cheat until they even cheat themselves because it's just part of them but john was sent with a message to prepare a way and no matter where we were what state of life that we were in when we are caught by that voice is called to straighten our life up praise the lord musicians you can come let's find a place to stop here tonight and we get uh so you know you you think about that your brother brandon talking about tension and the different things that we go through in life instead of complaining we have to be thankful to god and say lord maybe if you did if you did not put this thing on me just like a just like herself have brothers for their mouth maybe i might have been running all over the place i could never tell what my life would have been but god in his mercy he told paul my grace is sufficient for you verbum says brother jackmore i know i will be well he says because i saw that seven dolph he said it's gone now [Music] praise the lord and he was planning to do healing service that night he was setting people up for the road let's buy our heads tonight [Music] on this little prayer meeting night see that's the reason why god hate a prideful spirit god don't love a hearty spirit god find pleasure in the humble spirit because for god to use a man and keep that man god got to keep him humble other things that we can be able to identify in our life that we are ashamed of that we are embarrassed of but yeah we can give it to the lord [Music] we can give it to the lord and say father thank you maybe you allow that just to be able to keep me from straightening [Music] all my comfort you are more than life to [Music] besides jesus war in heaven [Music] oh yes [Music] i call we let your sing jesus jesus jesus oh jesus oh jesus yeah my home [Music] oh do you now pass me by jesus jesus might
