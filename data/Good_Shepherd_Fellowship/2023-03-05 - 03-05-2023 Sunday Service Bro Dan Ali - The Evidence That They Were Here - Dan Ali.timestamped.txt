[46:16] bless you all
[46:18] yes
[46:21] it's a wonderful time to always gather
[46:23] before the Lord
[46:26] um
[46:28] last Thursday when I went to work
[46:33] I knew I wasn't going to work on Friday
[46:36] so before I closed
[46:39] I printed
[46:41] a message I thought I was going to talk
[46:43] about today
[46:46] so
[46:47] and after printing it
[46:51] um
[46:52] I started going through it and it just
[46:54] don't know me that no this is not a
[46:56] message
[46:58] then I printed two more messages so I
[47:01] had three messages
[47:03] so I knew for sure
[47:05] that I was going to pick one of them
[47:08] then before Sunday before before before
[47:10] Friday morning
[47:13] I knew that I was not going to talk
[47:15] about any of them
[47:18] yeah so I just kept thinking and
[47:21] thinking
[47:22] my wife was on the other side talking
[47:24] and showing me something on the phone
[47:26] and all I was doing is hmm yes yes
[47:31] my attention was far away
[47:34] praise be to God now you'll be wondering
[47:37] how would you know that this is not what
[47:39] you talk about I don't know how to
[47:41] explain it though
[47:43] I don't know how to explain it but you
[47:45] pick something you are very sure that
[47:47] this is what you want to talk about or
[47:48] this is what the Lord is leading to talk
[47:50] about and all of a sudden it's like um
[47:54] it's like your tie is deflated something
[47:57] something just happens
[48:00] so
[48:02] I just
[48:04] Friday
[48:07] I started just thinking
[48:10] and normally I would have everything
[48:12] typed out printed out laid out
[48:15] by praise be to God today I am here
[48:19] with something I have just written back
[48:21] and forth
[48:22] I wouldn't say I don't have any notes I
[48:24] have notes Here
[48:25] praise be to God
[48:27] yeah but I'll be going back and forth if
[48:30] you ask me how is the service going to
[48:32] be today all I will tell is that I don't
[48:33] know
[48:35] praise be to God but one thing I do
[48:38] believe
[48:39] that God knows the needs there is in the
[48:42] house
[48:43] if you have prayed up
[48:46] and you are here to hear from God I
[48:49] assure you that you are going to hear
[48:50] from God
[48:52] there is no doubt
[48:54] it's not coming to preach you a good
[48:56] message no that is not the essence I
[49:00] don't think any Minister will come here
[49:02] and then just to preach you a good
[49:04] message no I don't think that is what it
[49:06] is about
[49:12] whatever the need is
[49:14] in the house
[49:16] it's our prayer this morning
[49:19] that the almighty God will address them
[49:22] I don't know
[49:24] we may be living the one
[49:26] and going after the 99 today
[49:28] oh probably we are living the 99 side
[49:31] and we are going after the one I don't
[49:33] know
[49:38] praise be to God
[49:41] so if you have prayed up
[49:44] and if you are in expectation
[49:46] I Believe by the grace of God you are
[49:49] going to hear from God this morning
[49:51] praise God
[49:54] it's always heartwarming
[49:56] as Lawrence said when Believers come
[49:59] together
[50:00] you know
[50:01] if or nothing at all to know that you
[50:03] are doing well
[50:04] and that
[50:06] you are you are you are you are at your
[50:08] personal Duty
[50:11] praise be to God
[50:13] so once again
[50:15] you are all warmly welcome
[50:17] and I would have us
[50:20] without wasting time
[50:22] it looks like it's going to be a very
[50:24] short service
[50:26] again I don't know praise Beauty God
[50:32] yes I pray God helps us
[50:34] shall we please stand for the reading of
[50:36] the word
[50:44] we are reading from Genesis 1.
[50:51] Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[51:06] Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[51:10] I read
[51:12] and God said
[51:14] let us make man in our image
[51:18] after our likeness
[51:21] and let them have dominion over the fish
[51:24] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[51:27] and over the cuddle and over all the
[51:29] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[51:32] creepeth upon the Earth
[51:35] so God created man in his own image in
[51:39] the image of God created him male and
[51:41] female created he them praise be to God
[51:44] and then let's just go to 2 7.
[51:49] Genesis 2 7. right there
[51:53] and the Lord God formed Man Out of the
[51:56] Dust of the ground and breathed into his
[51:58] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[52:02] became a living soul
[52:04] praise be to God
[52:06] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[52:08] reading of his word shall we please be
[52:09] seated
[52:13] praise God
[52:30] so from the scriptures we have just read
[52:35] God said
[52:38] let us make man
[52:42] in our own image
[52:45] and the image of God God is a spirit
[52:49] so God created man
[52:52] a spirit man
[52:54] after his own likeness
[52:58] now
[53:00] when you read failure
[53:03] the Bible says after God had done with
[53:06] creation everything was good everything
[53:07] was perfect
[53:09] God rested and God found Man Out of the
[53:12] Dust of the Earth
[53:14] and breathe into his nostrils the breath
[53:17] of life and Man became a living soul
[53:20] why because there was no man on the face
[53:23] of the Earth to till the Earth
[53:25] so God found Man Out of the Dust of the
[53:28] Earth
[53:29] now the spirit man God had created
[53:34] remember brother said that God had
[53:37] several
[53:38] attributes and one of the attributes of
[53:41] God was to be a savior now that Spirit
[53:45] man God created that man couldn't fall
[53:50] he was in the nature of God he couldn't
[53:53] fall I don't care what happens that man
[53:56] couldn't fall so there was absolutely no
[54:00] way God was going to realize that
[54:03] attribute of being a savior
[54:05] so God takes that man and puts him in
[54:08] that flesh
[54:09] it was not
[54:12] your desire to come into this flesh
[54:15] it was not your plan
[54:19] it was not about you
[54:22] you
[54:23] come in flesh had nothing to do with you
[54:26] it had everything to do with God because
[54:29] God wanted to be a savior and without
[54:32] men falling or without anything
[54:35] happening
[54:36] for God to salvage the situation he
[54:39] couldn't be a savior
[54:41] so you coming into this life
[54:45] because the Bible says there is sin did
[54:48] my mother conceive me and in iniquity
[54:51] was I shaping and I come into this life
[54:53] speaking what lies so every man that was
[54:57] born in this flesh was born into sin
[55:01] so when you come into this life and you
[55:03] are going around and committing crimes
[55:05] here and there jumping through Windows
[55:07] going to the nightclubs commit stealing
[55:10] here and there or as a matter of fact
[55:11] sometimes we just pass by something
[55:14] maybe you don't even pick it that thing
[55:16] will just jump and stick to your hand
[55:18] praise be to God that was how good some
[55:21] of us were
[55:22] why sin
[55:25] had just taken over
[55:28] and it had nothing to do with you
[55:31] it was so because God wanted you to see
[55:35] his glory
[55:37] it was like that little boy that was
[55:39] born blind at Birth
[55:42] the disciples asked the Lord Jesus
[55:44] Christ
[55:45] that is it by his fault I mean the
[55:48] father's fault or the mother's fault
[55:50] that further sin did Mother sin that was
[55:53] why this child was born blind he said no
[55:57] it was not because his father sinned it
[56:00] was not because his mother sinned it was
[56:02] not because they did something wrong but
[56:04] it was so because God wanted them to see
[56:07] his glory
[56:09] and you coming in human flesh
[56:13] coming in human flesh
[56:16] being under born in the bondage of sin
[56:18] committing evil and crimes and sin was
[56:22] because God wanted you to see his glory
[56:25] and as many of us that God has delivered
[56:28] we can testify it to it today
[56:31] we can testify to the glory of God that
[56:34] the Lord our God is a mighty God he is
[56:37] the chain breaker that is those
[56:39] circumstances that is beyond him
[56:44] I don't know about you as I've said
[56:46] timing again
[56:47] I can look behind me and I can tell how
[56:52] far God has brought me
[56:55] praise be to God
[56:57] it was so so man would see the glory of
[57:01] God now man is the most complex living
[57:05] organism that is on his face F surface
[57:10] as the prophet of God said man is a
[57:13] Triune being you have the flesh or the
[57:15] body you have the spirit and you have a
[57:18] soul
[57:20] there are five senses
[57:23] that the body has
[57:25] that governs the body
[57:27] and that only helps you in your natural
[57:30] environment in this physical world you
[57:34] can see you can hear you can smell you
[57:37] can taste and you can feel is just to be
[57:40] able to contact this F surface when you
[57:44] lose this senses you lose your
[57:46] environment
[57:47] just lose one of them and you'll realize
[57:50] that life is no more the same
[57:53] and to the spirit there are also five
[57:55] senses
[57:57] reasoning imagination affection memory
[58:01] and conscience and God has given five
[58:03] cents to the spirit to contact the
[58:07] spirit world
[58:09] now remember that the kingdom of God is
[58:12] not a physical Kingdom it's a spiritual
[58:14] Kingdom but you cannot use the five
[58:17] senses of the spirit to contact God
[58:20] and that is the mistake a lot of us make
[58:23] that we try to contact God using the
[58:27] five senses of our spirit which is wrong
[58:29] there is only one one thing God has
[58:33] given man that God can be contacted and
[58:37] that is faith
[58:38] that is why the Bible says that without
[58:40] faith it is impossible for any man to
[58:43] please God
[58:45] that is why when you are coming to God
[58:47] you must first believe that he is and he
[58:50] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[58:52] seek him
[58:54] without faith you can never please God
[58:57] that is the only thing that can that
[59:00] that can get in contact with the Throne
[59:01] of God that when you come before the
[59:04] Throne of God by faith heaven knows that
[59:07] a child of God is taken
[59:10] wherever you are when you cry out God
[59:13] hears your cry it doesn't matter how
[59:16] many people are calling he can this he
[59:19] hears that distinct voice
[59:21] praise be to God and he knows oh I have
[59:26] a sheep that is crying for help
[59:29] praise God
[59:32] so man
[59:34] in the soul of man God knew the hostile
[59:39] environment his children were going to
[59:42] go through
[59:43] so God prepared you in advance
[59:47] in advance
[59:49] it was God's
[59:53] design implementation he didn't have to
[59:56] come back to operate upon you to do
[59:59] something different
[1:00:00] but everything you needed for this
[1:00:03] journey God placed it right in here
[1:00:06] all you need to overcome God has given
[1:00:10] it to you already
[1:00:12] it is to you everything you need to
[1:00:15] overcome God has given it to you if you
[1:00:18] are doing anything wrong it is a choice
[1:00:20] you have made
[1:00:22] there are no excuses
[1:00:25] if there is anything wrong you are doing
[1:00:29] you know it is contrary to the word of
[1:00:31] God you know it is evil you know it is
[1:00:34] Unbecoming of a child of God it is a
[1:00:37] choice you have made but everything you
[1:00:39] need to overcome God has given it to you
[1:00:44] and that seed of life
[1:00:47] that seed of life God has placed in you
[1:00:51] gods that gems seed of life that seed is
[1:00:55] lying the dormant just waiting for its
[1:00:58] time of manifestation
[1:01:00] like any seed
[1:01:04] take the mango seed for one when you
[1:01:06] take a mango seed
[1:01:09] everything the mango needs to be in his
[1:01:12] lifetime is in that seed
[1:01:16] praise be to God
[1:01:19] the height of the tree
[1:01:22] how big is going to be
[1:01:25] the shape of the mango fruits
[1:01:28] how sweet or how big how sour is going
[1:01:31] to be is all in that in that seed
[1:01:34] whether when the mango gets ripe is
[1:01:37] going to be yellow it's going to be
[1:01:39] violet
[1:01:41] is going to be red it's all it's all
[1:01:44] represented in that fruit
[1:01:46] the aroma is all in there
[1:01:49] everything the mango needs is right in
[1:01:53] the seed
[1:01:55] and everything you need to overcome
[1:02:00] God knowing what you are going to go
[1:02:02] through before the foundation of the
[1:02:04] earth God has placed it in that seed of
[1:02:07] life it is right in here
[1:02:10] praise be to God
[1:02:15] it is not now God is going to do it
[1:02:20] he has already done it
[1:02:25] a lot of the times
[1:02:30] we lack consciousness
[1:02:36] you never know what you have
[1:02:40] and you never know who you truly are
[1:02:45] until that jam seed of life is struck by
[1:02:49] the word and it begins to live
[1:02:54] then that Godly consciousness
[1:02:57] begin
[1:02:59] to come in
[1:03:01] then you begin to realize who you truly
[1:03:04] are
[1:03:05] you are not the man that is sitting here
[1:03:10] you are not you we are the Genesis
[1:03:13] Genesis 1 Genesis 2 7 is a man that is
[1:03:17] standing here
[1:03:19] but you are not seeing the murder of
[1:03:21] Genesis 1 26.
[1:03:23] and that is the real you
[1:03:26] that man that couldn't fall
[1:03:28] praise be to God
[1:03:31] that man that couldn't fall
[1:03:36] you are not who you think you are
[1:03:40] but when that realization begins to come
[1:03:42] in and you begin to realize who you are
[1:03:45] and you begin to get conscious of the
[1:03:47] things of God things begin to change
[1:03:50] around your life
[1:03:52] but before then that seed is lying down
[1:03:55] there dormant
[1:03:58] all those years
[1:04:00] you go climbing people's properties in
[1:04:02] the night all those years
[1:04:05] you go doing things you shouldn't do
[1:04:08] that seed is dying there very dormant
[1:04:12] but as soon as this time of
[1:04:14] manifestation comes
[1:04:17] the Bible says when the prophet of God
[1:04:19] says when the deep colors there is a
[1:04:21] deep to respond
[1:04:24] you can be a thousand people sitting
[1:04:26] down
[1:04:27] but when you hear the word it stress you
[1:04:31] you know that something has changed
[1:04:35] and when that Godly Consciousness begin
[1:04:38] to strike
[1:04:39] look when you go out there and you look
[1:04:42] at the skies all you see is God
[1:04:45] when you look at the trees all you see
[1:04:47] is God when you see the bird flying in
[1:04:50] the air all you see is God
[1:04:52] you become so conscious of God
[1:04:55] then when you take a step
[1:04:58] you know that God is there
[1:05:01] you don't have to say it to believe it
[1:05:03] you know for a fact that he is dead
[1:05:09] like that story about that lady
[1:05:13] whose father was living with her
[1:05:16] and uh she wanted to have a party
[1:05:19] with her lady friends
[1:05:21] and um
[1:05:23] she went and told his daddy her Daddy
[1:05:25] Daddy ah my lady friends are coming here
[1:05:28] we are going to have a little party but
[1:05:31] you know you don't want to mess up with
[1:05:32] those ladies that that he said no no no
[1:05:34] no I don't want to mess up with them
[1:05:36] just do your own thing and then he takes
[1:05:39] his daddy puts him in another room
[1:05:41] somewhere and then he gives the daddy an
[1:05:44] atlas
[1:05:46] why because
[1:05:48] daddy will get up
[1:05:50] take his Bible
[1:05:52] he will read his Bible
[1:05:54] and that he will just be praising God
[1:05:56] shouting hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:06:00] so now she was going to have a party
[1:06:02] she didn't want Daddy to mess that party
[1:06:04] up
[1:06:05] so she takes that in a different room
[1:06:07] who's daddy there
[1:06:09] and she wouldn't give Daddy
[1:06:11] his Bible
[1:06:13] gives the daddy an atlas
[1:06:16] so daddy takes the atlas the friends
[1:06:19] come
[1:06:20] they are somewhere in the house
[1:06:23] a study here yeah he's here is that you
[1:06:26] know going to this no no no I gave him
[1:06:27] mom Atlas
[1:06:29] if he has his Bible then we are in
[1:06:31] trouble but Daddy has an atlas we are
[1:06:33] fine so oh smart girl high five
[1:06:37] praise the Lord and then they just sat
[1:06:40] down
[1:06:41] they were having a good time
[1:06:43] Daddy was upstairs
[1:06:46] he opened his Atlas a year of open his
[1:06:49] Atlas Africa open his Atlas Asia just
[1:06:54] got to a place he just saw the sea and
[1:06:57] as he was reading the footnotes he says
[1:07:00] that the sea is bottomless then he is
[1:07:03] red
[1:07:05] praise the Lord thank you Jesus and they
[1:07:08] said what is happening upstairs they say
[1:07:10] ah I don't know apparently there's
[1:07:12] something going on they run upstairs get
[1:07:14] to Daddy Daddy what's going on he said
[1:07:16] come and see come and see he said Daddy
[1:07:18] it's an atlas he said yeah but come and
[1:07:20] see
[1:07:21] let's see say what about the sea he says
[1:07:24] say the sea is bottomless yes Daddy what
[1:07:26] about it he says the Bible says my sis
[1:07:30] my sins are cut into the sea of
[1:07:33] forgetfulness
[1:07:35] and they are still sinking
[1:07:37] I have believed the Lord 20 years 40
[1:07:41] years 60 years my sins are still sinking
[1:07:46] praise be to God
[1:07:49] that is how conscious
[1:07:51] you get
[1:07:53] when you are sealed in with God
[1:07:56] every step you take you see nothing but
[1:07:59] God
[1:08:00] praise be to God life is no longer about
[1:08:03] you but about Christ
[1:08:15] Godly consciousness
[1:08:17] will take you away
[1:08:20] from a lot of troubles
[1:08:23] the reason why we do certain things is
[1:08:26] because we lack that consciousness
[1:08:31] the reason why
[1:08:34] we can sit and do nothing but gossip all
[1:08:36] day it's because we lack that
[1:08:38] consciousness
[1:08:40] the reason why we go out of our place to
[1:08:43] go to places that children of God should
[1:08:45] not go is because we lack that
[1:08:47] Consciousness the reason why we keep
[1:08:49] Fellowship that we shouldn't be keeping
[1:08:51] is because we lack that consciousness
[1:08:59] there was a story
[1:09:02] about a father
[1:09:06] there was Hunger
[1:09:09] and the father didn't have money to buy
[1:09:12] food there was not even food to buy
[1:09:15] so
[1:09:16] the father went to the bush and went and
[1:09:19] surveyed and he saw somebody's Farm
[1:09:22] how many people know cassava
[1:09:25] beautiful for those of who don't know
[1:09:28] what cassava is it's a root crop
[1:09:30] that tree can grow up to this height you
[1:09:33] have to hold a tree to pull it up
[1:09:36] so he took his son it's amazing what
[1:09:40] peace and parents can treat their
[1:09:41] children
[1:09:42] say come on let's go they say daddy
[1:09:45] where are we going just follow me take
[1:09:47] that back put it under your armpit don't
[1:09:48] let anybody see it and that he was in
[1:09:50] front with his machete
[1:09:52] and then they get to the farm daddy said
[1:09:55] you know what stand here
[1:09:57] and then say when I say here when I do
[1:10:00] this watch if you see anybody coming
[1:10:02] just let me know if I do this let's if
[1:10:06] there's anybody coming let me know say
[1:10:08] okay Daddy the boy didn't know what that
[1:10:10] he was going to do daddy enters the farm
[1:10:13] and then he still was looking at the boy
[1:10:20] and then Daddy had a cassava tree
[1:10:24] daddy daddy and the daddy just jumped
[1:10:27] look it's not an easy thing to be a
[1:10:29] tiffo
[1:10:33] it's not an easy thing
[1:10:36] it's not an easy thing
[1:10:39] I remember those days I was born and
[1:10:42] bred in the barracks
[1:10:44] oh my goodness
[1:10:46] oh my that was really bad
[1:10:50] I was really bad
[1:10:52] I go in the night and I climb people's
[1:10:54] properties
[1:11:02] I go in the day and I survey all the
[1:11:05] barracks
[1:11:06] and I know where their right ones are
[1:11:09] so in the night I come I I know where
[1:11:11] I'm going
[1:11:15] I enter people sugarcane Farms
[1:11:20] anything and sometimes you are typical
[1:11:24] and then you step on on a stick and it
[1:11:27] will trigger something and then your
[1:11:29] heart will almost come into your mouth
[1:11:35] the father just jumped he thought
[1:11:37] somebody was coming why is somebody's
[1:11:39] wrong he said Daddy then he went to the
[1:11:41] boy what is wrong
[1:11:43] the boy says Daddy
[1:11:45] you said I should look here and I should
[1:11:47] look there but he didn't ask me to look
[1:11:49] upstairs
[1:11:53] then Daddy said
[1:11:54] bad boy bad boy
[1:11:56] let's go home start a knocking his head
[1:11:58] your hunger will kill you hunger will
[1:12:00] kill you
[1:12:01] the day was ashamed
[1:12:04] we need
[1:12:06] children like that
[1:12:09] that would it would due respect
[1:12:13] s while the daddy is wrong daddy you are
[1:12:15] wrong that's why the word of God says
[1:12:17] we need to arrest like that that will
[1:12:20] deal respect would put your parents in
[1:12:22] line
[1:12:23] we need brothers and sisters that will
[1:12:26] look at you in the face and tell you
[1:12:28] this is wrong according to the word of
[1:12:30] God
[1:12:35] praise be to God
[1:12:37] Hello Kitty let's go let's go they never
[1:12:40] died of hunger anyway
[1:12:44] but father came back to his senses
[1:12:50] what we lack
[1:12:52] is that consciousness
[1:12:55] sometimes you think your God is sleeping
[1:12:58] sometimes you think he's traveled
[1:13:00] sometimes you think you have hidden so
[1:13:02] much
[1:13:03] that you can do it and get away with it
[1:13:06] but it is going to wait for you
[1:13:08] somewhere
[1:13:09] if you don't place it under the blood
[1:13:11] it's going to catch up with you someday
[1:13:16] you either expose it now or it is going
[1:13:19] to expose you then
[1:13:23] sin is a dangerous thing never entertain
[1:13:26] sin in your life
[1:13:31] sin is a reproach to any people
[1:13:35] anything you know is evil stay away from
[1:13:38] it
[1:13:40] for the bible say that they that name of
[1:13:42] the name of the Lord should apart from
[1:13:44] iniquity
[1:13:46] do not let it be mentioned among you
[1:13:51] do not turn the grace of God into this
[1:13:54] grace
[1:13:55] if God out of Grace has delivered you
[1:13:58] you should be thankful enough to live a
[1:14:01] life of consecration
[1:14:05] praise be to God
[1:14:08] sometimes that is just all we need
[1:14:12] to stay in cause
[1:14:14] on course that you know
[1:14:17] I am not alone here
[1:14:20] because the Bible says so
[1:14:22] and the word of God is true
[1:14:25] I will never leave you enough forsake
[1:14:26] you I would be with you always
[1:14:29] that you know that God is here
[1:14:32] God is present
[1:14:36] praise be to God
[1:14:38] I had that testimony from sis Christine
[1:14:41] talking about a bus hit her car
[1:14:46] sometimes you hear some of these stories
[1:14:48] and the end is just terrible
[1:14:52] but whatever you find yourself as an as
[1:14:55] a child of God God has given his angels
[1:14:58] charge over you
[1:15:00] before the situation happens
[1:15:03] they are there already
[1:15:07] we are not alone Saints we are not alone
[1:15:12] we are not alone
[1:15:14] praise be to God the Lord our God is in
[1:15:17] our midst
[1:15:20] never think you are alone never think
[1:15:22] you can just do anything no you can't
[1:15:24] just do anything
[1:15:27] we have a place we are going to
[1:15:30] the Bible says we already seated in
[1:15:32] Heavenly places through Christ Jesus
[1:15:35] we are Heaven bound
[1:15:37] praise be to God
[1:15:41] man is a complex creature
[1:15:45] that is a part of man that is having
[1:15:47] bound
[1:15:48] and there is a part of man that is
[1:15:50] Earthly bound
[1:15:51] there is a part of man that is of god
[1:15:54] and there is a part of men that is of
[1:15:56] the devil this flesh can never be
[1:15:58] redeemed
[1:15:59] there is a part of man that is
[1:16:01] redeemable you are real you and there is
[1:16:04] a part of man that is irredeemable it
[1:16:06] can never be redeemed it doesn't matter
[1:16:08] how much Holy Ghost you are filled with
[1:16:10] this flesh can never be redeemed
[1:16:14] don't let the flesh drag you you drag it
[1:16:17] along
[1:16:19] that crackers it is drag it
[1:16:23] and when that comes when that time comes
[1:16:25] for you to live you are abandon it and
[1:16:27] go
[1:16:33] praise be to God
[1:16:37] what are we talking about today
[1:16:42] I even forgot to tell
[1:16:45] my title
[1:16:48] the title of my message
[1:16:54] praise be to God
[1:16:57] the title of my message
[1:17:01] the evidence
[1:17:03] that they were here
[1:17:08] that is the title
[1:17:10] of my message
[1:17:12] the evidence that they were here
[1:17:19] there were two missionaries
[1:17:22] you know the good thing
[1:17:25] about Christianity now when God does
[1:17:27] something in your life you want the
[1:17:29] world to know about it
[1:17:32] as a Christian
[1:17:34] that have tasted of God
[1:17:37] that knows how awesome your God is how
[1:17:40] Mighty your God is
[1:17:42] that you have all the promises
[1:17:45] of a son you want you want to extend
[1:17:47] that to others
[1:17:49] you don't want to be you don't want to
[1:17:51] be selfish
[1:17:55] this missionaries
[1:17:57] went far beyond their country
[1:18:01] into a hidden Nation
[1:18:03] to go and preach about the Lord to talk
[1:18:06] about the Lord
[1:18:08] and there they both took ill
[1:18:12] and they died
[1:18:16] and the the people that had believed the
[1:18:18] message
[1:18:20] just bury them
[1:18:23] and then they built a monument and then
[1:18:26] they wrote on it
[1:18:28] this is the evidence
[1:18:30] that they put their names there this is
[1:18:33] the evidence that they were here
[1:18:39] now they took the message
[1:18:43] and they started propagating the message
[1:18:47] talking about the antonyms of God they
[1:18:50] didn't know much by the little they knew
[1:18:52] they just started you don't have to know
[1:18:54] too much to be able to share
[1:18:57] it's just like somebody who says Let Me
[1:19:00] Wait Till I I become a millionaire
[1:19:02] before I started sharing even when you
[1:19:04] become a millionaire you will not share
[1:19:07] let me wait till I become a billionaire
[1:19:09] you become a billionaire then you become
[1:19:12] very stingy
[1:19:16] yes
[1:19:18] sharing is just part of Christianity
[1:19:24] and what happened
[1:19:25] that took the message they didn't know
[1:19:28] much the little that they knew they just
[1:19:30] went around house to house sharing and
[1:19:33] people started converting and guess what
[1:19:36] not too long after that
[1:19:39] people in the city got offense got
[1:19:41] offended by it and they said no you guys
[1:19:45] are teaching our children's strange
[1:19:47] goals
[1:19:48] you are taking our children from our
[1:19:50] customs from our traditions and you are
[1:19:53] teaching them something strange
[1:19:55] and a startup executing them and they
[1:19:58] couldn't stand the persecution and they
[1:20:00] finally had to live
[1:20:02] and when they were living
[1:20:03] let's start together and they ask
[1:20:05] themselves where are we going they said
[1:20:08] we do not know
[1:20:09] by the god in whom we have believed
[1:20:12] we direct us which way to go
[1:20:15] by faith Again by faith they took a step
[1:20:19] of faith
[1:20:21] and for every time you take a step of
[1:20:23] faith
[1:20:24] praise be to God
[1:20:26] if your intentions are good
[1:20:29] if your motives are right God will never
[1:20:32] put you to shame
[1:20:35] and then they went went the people were
[1:20:38] just laughing don't mind them they will
[1:20:40] come back
[1:20:41] they went went months years they never
[1:20:44] saw them that was just the end
[1:20:48] nobody knew where they were nobody knew
[1:20:51] where they went nobody knew how far they
[1:20:54] went
[1:20:54] but they were gone they never came back
[1:20:58] now the younger Generations came and
[1:21:01] they had the story
[1:21:03] and life was not good
[1:21:06] in the village
[1:21:08] and they said you know what
[1:21:10] says this once went and they never came
[1:21:13] back it means that life is better on
[1:21:16] that side
[1:21:17] but how do we got to know why they went
[1:21:21] that was a million dollar question
[1:21:24] so one day one of these guys went out on
[1:21:27] a Hunting Expedition
[1:21:29] and then he saw a stone
[1:21:33] with coordinates
[1:21:37] out of curiosity
[1:21:39] they started following it
[1:21:42] for weeks
[1:21:46] and then he saw another Stone
[1:21:49] then he said oh
[1:21:51] I have gotten the clue
[1:21:54] I have gotten the clue because they left
[1:21:57] behind a clue
[1:22:00] their people in the village thought he
[1:22:02] was dead he was moored by an animal
[1:22:05] they performed this funeral
[1:22:07] and shortly after that here the man
[1:22:09] comes where have you been and then he
[1:22:13] tells them the story he said you know
[1:22:14] what I am ready to leave this town
[1:22:17] I am going to look for them
[1:22:20] and he got some people to come with him
[1:22:22] and then they moved
[1:22:25] just following the trail
[1:22:28] following the trail
[1:22:29] following the direction following the
[1:22:32] compass it's just like a compass that
[1:22:34] when a plane is in the air you don't
[1:22:37] have to be a the pilot
[1:22:39] if if I'm a pilot and I'm going to I'm
[1:22:43] going to Japan I don't have to know what
[1:22:45] Japan is
[1:22:48] all I just have to do is plug in the
[1:22:50] coordinates or put the CD in when I go
[1:22:54] out there the compass is going to lead
[1:22:56] me
[1:22:58] they were just following the compass
[1:23:00] following the direction
[1:23:02] and then
[1:23:07] they got to a place
[1:23:10] and they saw that oh people have settled
[1:23:13] here before
[1:23:15] they could see the Mad houses roofed
[1:23:18] with touch they had
[1:23:21] um orange Plantation they had fruits and
[1:23:25] they could see half
[1:23:28] I don't know how many people know what
[1:23:29] they have is it's a place where you bend
[1:23:32] you bend firewood
[1:23:34] how many people are with me
[1:23:36] very good they could see it
[1:23:39] and evidence
[1:23:41] that they were there
[1:23:44] they did not see them
[1:23:46] but there was an Evidence
[1:23:49] that they were there
[1:23:52] so they camped
[1:23:55] and then they revealed the place
[1:23:57] and they settled
[1:24:00] and they started feeding on the fruits
[1:24:02] they had planted
[1:24:04] life was good
[1:24:07] but then the people had a motto that
[1:24:10] life is good but it's better on the
[1:24:12] other side
[1:24:14] so the people after some time
[1:24:16] said you know what
[1:24:19] this is the motto
[1:24:21] that life is good here but it's better
[1:24:23] on the other side you know what we are
[1:24:26] going to move and some people said no
[1:24:28] let's just settle here this place is
[1:24:30] good and the Elder said no if it was not
[1:24:33] good for them
[1:24:35] it's not good
[1:24:38] for us and they moved on
[1:24:41] for a very long time they'll go to the
[1:24:44] second place
[1:24:45] again they settled
[1:24:48] life was good
[1:24:50] but they had to move again
[1:24:52] tell the god to the Final Destination
[1:24:56] till they've got to what was supposed to
[1:24:58] be their final destination
[1:25:00] they they saw a whole Township
[1:25:04] a whole Township but there was nobody
[1:25:09] and there they decided to settle
[1:25:13] there they decided to settle
[1:25:16] now when they settled
[1:25:19] they saw that a cross a huge cross
[1:25:24] was put up
[1:25:26] and on the cross they all wrote their
[1:25:29] names
[1:25:31] they all wrote their names
[1:25:33] and this was the message
[1:25:36] this was the message
[1:25:47] For the Love of Christ
[1:25:50] we have moved on
[1:25:52] leaving behind everything
[1:25:56] enjoy them
[1:25:58] but don't let them hold you down
[1:26:03] do not let them hold you down
[1:26:09] praise be to God
[1:26:11] and I want to remind us this morning
[1:26:14] that in this journey of Life must
[1:26:17] especially for the young ones
[1:26:20] that as you go through this journey of
[1:26:22] life you are going to get to different
[1:26:25] stages of your life
[1:26:29] that you get to a place that life is so
[1:26:32] good
[1:26:34] remind yourself
[1:26:36] that even though it is good
[1:26:38] it's always better on the other side
[1:26:42] enjoy it as much as you can
[1:26:45] don't let it hold
[1:26:50] you down
[1:26:52] move on with God
[1:26:56] and as you move on
[1:26:59] you would realize that you get to
[1:27:01] another place which is even much better
[1:27:04] you'll be moving in stages these stages
[1:27:07] till you get to a place where you
[1:27:09] realize all your dreams
[1:27:12] all your dreams have come true
[1:27:15] that five-star life you are looking for
[1:27:18] it has come
[1:27:20] this is where
[1:27:22] you have to keep reminding yourself
[1:27:25] that even though it is good here is
[1:27:28] better on the other side
[1:27:31] enjoy it as much as you can don't let it
[1:27:34] hold you down
[1:27:37] praise be to God
[1:27:40] keep reminding yourself Who You Are
[1:27:43] don't let it hold you down
[1:27:49] to serve God
[1:27:52] there are a lot of things
[1:27:54] you would have to leave behind
[1:27:58] you have to leave them behind
[1:28:01] we come into this life
[1:28:04] we test sentences from our our our
[1:28:06] ancestral lineage from our mother's side
[1:28:10] from our father's side and then when we
[1:28:12] go into life we ourselves add some
[1:28:18] and then you are walking and you can't
[1:28:20] even walk well because you have a lot of
[1:28:22] things to drag behind you
[1:28:27] you have to leave them behind
[1:28:29] in order to be able to work with God
[1:28:34] you can't drag them along
[1:28:37] you can't
[1:28:40] either the way of God or it's your way
[1:28:43] it cannot be both your way in the way of
[1:28:45] God
[1:28:50] to serve God
[1:28:51] there are a lot of things you have to
[1:28:53] leave behind
[1:28:55] you would have to leave your customs and
[1:28:58] your Traditions behind
[1:29:00] you will have to leave your pride behind
[1:29:04] behind you will have to leave behind
[1:29:05] everything every iniquity
[1:29:10] like the Rich Young Ruler
[1:29:12] who came to the Lord what must I do
[1:29:16] to be said to have salvation
[1:29:18] he was very very rich and the Lord Jesus
[1:29:20] has told him go sell everything you have
[1:29:23] give it to the poor and come back and
[1:29:24] follow me
[1:29:25] a lot of the times
[1:29:27] it is not something oh that is very easy
[1:29:31] to do away with
[1:29:32] a lot of the times is something you
[1:29:35] cherish
[1:29:37] something you are really holding on
[1:29:39] something you esteem
[1:29:43] and that is what Christ wants
[1:29:46] that thing that you think you can only
[1:29:48] you cannot let go
[1:29:50] it is what is in your way
[1:29:52] if you can let go of it and let Christ
[1:29:55] be life will be different
[1:29:59] preserve God
[1:30:01] to serve God
[1:30:02] you have to let go a lot of things
[1:30:07] you have to learn to forgive
[1:30:10] you have to learn to let go
[1:30:16] what sin is it
[1:30:18] that cannot be forgiven you have to let
[1:30:21] go
[1:30:24] seek peace with all men
[1:30:28] praise be to God
[1:30:35] so we according to this life
[1:30:37] no chance not just to pass through
[1:30:42] we are called not just to pass through
[1:30:47] oh I'm just passing through
[1:30:49] there is nothing like that for a child
[1:30:51] of God
[1:30:55] oh I came
[1:30:57] and I'm gone no
[1:31:00] we are called to leave behind footprints
[1:31:06] we have to leave behind
[1:31:09] and evidence that we were here
[1:31:14] that when you are gone
[1:31:18] 10 20 30 40 years
[1:31:22] people will look at that evidence you
[1:31:24] have left behind and so oh so so and so
[1:31:28] sister sister and soul brother was here
[1:31:30] because this is the evidence she left
[1:31:32] behind
[1:31:34] like brother one last two Sundays I
[1:31:38] believe was talking about uh the blind
[1:31:41] the blind uh musician
[1:31:43] the lady that was born blind
[1:31:46] very good
[1:31:50] she is dead and gone I believe
[1:31:54] good
[1:31:57] but she has left behind an Evidence
[1:32:01] that she was here
[1:32:04] if not we wouldn't be talking about her
[1:32:08] she has impacted the world
[1:32:12] she has changed people's lives
[1:32:15] she has given people hope
[1:32:22] there is an Evidence
[1:32:24] that she was here
[1:32:26] we never got to see her
[1:32:29] but we know
[1:32:31] from the evidence that behind
[1:32:34] that she was here
[1:32:37] praise be to God so we are not called
[1:32:40] just to come and walk through
[1:32:45] there is no place for people that you
[1:32:48] who just want to walk through
[1:32:53] we are called
[1:32:55] to leave behind
[1:32:57] footprints
[1:32:59] praise be to God
[1:33:02] Moses left behind
[1:33:05] footprints
[1:33:07] he left an Evidence we can take it from
[1:33:10] The Book of Genesis all through
[1:33:13] if we want to talk about people that
[1:33:15] have left behind Footprints people that
[1:33:18] have left an evidence that they were
[1:33:20] here
[1:33:21] I don't know
[1:33:23] one man talking about it two months will
[1:33:25] not even bring it to an end
[1:33:28] so we are not going to attempt in any
[1:33:30] way from a ship
[1:33:32] to deal with all that but I'll just pick
[1:33:34] one or two
[1:33:36] that Moses
[1:33:38] we all know how he ended up in Pharaoh's
[1:33:41] house
[1:33:43] and with all that upbringing
[1:33:47] with The Prestige
[1:33:49] the fame
[1:33:51] the position the pegs
[1:33:55] he was on the list to becoming the nest
[1:33:58] in rank
[1:34:02] as a pharaoh
[1:34:04] and then with all that he looks through
[1:34:07] the window
[1:34:09] and he sees the Church of Israel
[1:34:12] in the pits
[1:34:14] just working themselves out
[1:34:16] with a Taskmaster standing behind them
[1:34:19] with his long wave
[1:34:21] and then he looks at them
[1:34:23] and he tells himself even though it is
[1:34:26] good here
[1:34:27] from the story I have heard from Mama
[1:34:30] because his mother
[1:34:33] told him you are born to be a deliverer
[1:34:36] hey he knows
[1:34:38] about his God
[1:34:40] that led him to kill that Egyptian
[1:34:44] and he looks at them
[1:34:46] even though life is good here even
[1:34:49] though I am comfortable here even though
[1:34:52] I am going to be the next Pharaoh but
[1:34:54] life is better on the other side
[1:34:57] praise be to God
[1:35:00] he didn't let that
[1:35:02] to pin him down
[1:35:04] he did not allow that
[1:35:06] to hold him down
[1:35:12] praise be to God
[1:35:14] the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:35:17] when he came into this life he left his
[1:35:20] glory from his glory above he came into
[1:35:23] a human flesh
[1:35:25] just
[1:35:28] pave a way for you and me
[1:35:32] can you imagine if he had not come
[1:35:35] who wouldn't be here this morning
[1:35:38] we wouldn't be talking about him this
[1:35:39] morning we wouldn't be talking about
[1:35:41] salvation this morning
[1:35:43] we will not talk about the Rapture this
[1:35:45] morning
[1:35:46] if he had not come to die for our sins
[1:35:48] he paid the price
[1:35:51] so we should go scot-free
[1:35:54] our Lord and our savior Jesus
[1:35:58] he chose to die
[1:36:01] it was a choice he made
[1:36:04] he could have chosen not to
[1:36:07] he could have chosen not to
[1:36:09] why would you and me have been today
[1:36:12] if he had decided I am not going to do
[1:36:15] it
[1:36:17] but out of love
[1:36:19] for you and me so we don't perish
[1:36:23] he gives all
[1:36:24] even his very own life
[1:36:27] he gave it
[1:36:28] can you imagine
[1:36:31] death it was not as if he died an easy
[1:36:35] death it was not an easy death
[1:36:38] that is not easy death
[1:36:41] I have seen people in prison remember I
[1:36:44] was a prison officer for 10 years
[1:36:48] and I have seen people oh
[1:36:51] people that were where where were put in
[1:36:54] prison for life no not life but but but
[1:36:56] for death okay they were just there
[1:36:59] awaiting their time of execution
[1:37:02] and they will be there
[1:37:04] um
[1:37:05] what is therefore
[1:37:07] they knock their chests what is death
[1:37:11] why one day born one day die
[1:37:14] what is death
[1:37:17] wait
[1:37:19] till you see death face to face
[1:37:23] and what they used to do which I believe
[1:37:26] they still do because I've seen it here
[1:37:28] in America
[1:37:30] that somebody on a death row
[1:37:32] before they come and take you and kill
[1:37:34] you
[1:37:36] um they would come a day before
[1:37:39] and then they will come with a chaplain
[1:37:41] and what have you they will come
[1:37:44] um they'll pray for you and tell you
[1:37:47] tomorrow we are coming for you uh
[1:37:50] anything you want to say what what do
[1:37:52] you want what do you want any special
[1:37:55] thing we can do for you any food you ask
[1:37:57] for to give it to you just that you
[1:37:59] don't have the appetite to eat
[1:38:02] foreign
[1:38:06] alcohols are not allowed but they'll
[1:38:09] give it to you they can't drink it
[1:38:12] some will ask for cigarettes
[1:38:14] but you don't sleep
[1:38:17] they'll give you Secret
[1:38:19] and what they do they put a secret in
[1:38:21] their mouth
[1:38:23] they will light another one
[1:38:27] they can't smoke
[1:38:30] why because they have told them that in
[1:38:33] 24 hours we are coming for you
[1:38:36] that night they are not going to sleep
[1:38:40] sleep will disappear
[1:38:43] and can you imagine this is somebody
[1:38:45] that is going to die by the gun before
[1:38:47] you hear the gas sound
[1:38:49] you're already dead and yet they are
[1:38:51] scared
[1:38:53] just compare that here in America they
[1:38:55] don't have that but by Electric uh how
[1:38:58] do they call it
[1:39:00] um electric chair and a little injection
[1:39:03] that is what they do here in America
[1:39:05] and that takes just seconds and you are
[1:39:07] gone and think about it that the Lord of
[1:39:11] Glory
[1:39:13] the almighty God in human flesh
[1:39:17] that he could just look ahead
[1:39:20] he was not imagining it
[1:39:23] but he was seeing the death that he was
[1:39:26] going to die
[1:39:28] the most cruel death
[1:39:31] the most cruel death that you could ever
[1:39:34] think of death on the cross how they
[1:39:37] were going to drive their nails in his
[1:39:39] hands ah I mean come again think about
[1:39:41] it
[1:39:43] the Bible says he prayed then he started
[1:39:47] sweating
[1:39:49] to the the sweat of his face started
[1:39:52] dropping like the cross of blood
[1:39:54] it was not an easy death don't let
[1:39:56] anybody ever tell you that
[1:40:00] but he still chose to do it
[1:40:03] so you and me can go scot-free
[1:40:07] how we ought to be grateful to the
[1:40:09] almighty God
[1:40:11] we ought to be grateful of all the
[1:40:14] creations of God we ought to be very
[1:40:16] thankful
[1:40:17] that he has given us hope of eternal
[1:40:20] life
[1:40:21] that when you come to the end of your
[1:40:23] road you know that you are going to live
[1:40:25] again the death and hell can never hold
[1:40:28] you back
[1:40:29] praise be to God
[1:40:35] and he died
[1:40:37] he left behind
[1:40:39] he left it behind
[1:40:42] and evidence
[1:40:43] that he was here
[1:40:47] a Rugged Cross
[1:40:49] and an empty tomb
[1:40:52] he left an evidence that he was here
[1:40:58] he sent the holy ghosts
[1:41:01] and evidence that he was here
[1:41:04] if he had not come and gone the Holy
[1:41:07] Ghost wouldn't have come
[1:41:09] and every day he was here
[1:41:14] healing
[1:41:16] and evidence that he was here
[1:41:19] we talk about the Rapture that anytime
[1:41:21] could be the day and will be out of here
[1:41:24] in a twinkling of an eye is an evidence
[1:41:26] that he was here
[1:41:31] praise be to God
[1:41:33] and remember
[1:41:40] that we all
[1:41:44] have to leave behind footprints
[1:41:48] the footprints you live
[1:41:57] the footprints you live
[1:42:00] it determines where you are going
[1:42:05] talking about footprints
[1:42:07] and an evidence that we were here
[1:42:10] we can talk about the negative side
[1:42:13] and mercy talk about people and the food
[1:42:16] peace they have left behind
[1:42:19] we can mention people talk about the
[1:42:22] evidence they have left behind
[1:42:24] but I don't want us to waste our time
[1:42:26] there this morning
[1:42:28] I can hold you down to that for the next
[1:42:30] 30 minutes
[1:42:35] praise be to God
[1:42:38] I want us to look
[1:42:40] on the good side
[1:43:03] foreign
[1:43:09] you ask yourself
[1:43:14] the life you are living today
[1:43:19] if you look behind you
[1:43:22] what Footprints have you left behind so
[1:43:25] far
[1:43:29] what are the footprints
[1:43:32] you have left behind so far
[1:43:36] when you look behind you
[1:43:38] and you see the footprints you have left
[1:43:41] behind is this something you'll be proud
[1:43:44] of
[1:43:49] because remember
[1:43:51] there are people that are coming after
[1:43:53] us
[1:43:54] and they are walking in those footprints
[1:43:58] so just imagine somebody just
[1:44:02] to the foot of the Hill
[1:44:04] and they look at those footprints
[1:44:08] will they be happy
[1:44:10] walking in those footprints
[1:44:13] will they be proud
[1:44:16] walking in those footprints
[1:44:24] what footprints
[1:44:26] are you leaving behind
[1:44:31] when God takes you home
[1:44:36] before the rapture
[1:44:41] what is going to be the evidence
[1:44:43] that you were here
[1:44:49] what is going to be the evidence
[1:44:52] that you were here
[1:44:55] oh you just passed through
[1:44:57] unnoticed
[1:45:02] remember
[1:45:05] it is a call to war
[1:45:09] it's a call to war
[1:45:12] we are not seeking peace
[1:45:15] with the devil it's a call to war
[1:45:19] for the Bible says that we were not
[1:45:21] against flesh and blood
[1:45:23] but against principalities against
[1:45:26] rulers of Darkness of this world
[1:45:29] against evil spirits
[1:45:32] we are warning against
[1:45:34] principalities
[1:45:37] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:45:41] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:45:43] carnal
[1:45:45] but they are Mighty to the pulling down
[1:45:47] of strongholds
[1:45:50] you are a warrior
[1:45:53] you are a warrior
[1:45:57] what are the warriors in the house
[1:46:01] I think of praise be to God I've seen
[1:46:03] some hands of God bless you
[1:46:07] I think of Caleb
[1:46:09] when Caleb and the other General Swanson
[1:46:13] spider land and 10 of them brought a
[1:46:16] Wiki report
[1:46:17] and Caleb and Joshua brought a very good
[1:46:20] report Moses made him a promise
[1:46:25] that the land that your feet have traded
[1:46:28] on will be given to you as an
[1:46:30] inheritance
[1:46:31] and your generation after you
[1:46:34] and after they took the land several
[1:46:37] years Joshua was not saying anything
[1:46:40] to Joshua he said Joshua
[1:46:43] I am
[1:46:45] eight years old now
[1:46:47] I am 85 years old
[1:46:49] and I am as strong as I am today I am as
[1:46:53] strong as I was 40 years ago
[1:46:56] Moses made me a promise
[1:46:59] that he is going to give me that land
[1:47:02] I'm taking that here give me that
[1:47:03] mountain
[1:47:05] praise be to God
[1:47:08] the Bible says
[1:47:10] Joshua
[1:47:12] blessed him
[1:47:13] and gave him that mountain
[1:47:16] and he went in and came out he took that
[1:47:19] mountain
[1:47:20] we are here
[1:47:22] we are here to walk
[1:47:26] 85 year old man
[1:47:29] saying that I am as strong today as I
[1:47:33] was
[1:47:34] 40 years ago
[1:47:36] and what are you young men and women
[1:47:39] doing
[1:47:40] what are we doing
[1:47:43] that we can hardly pray we go on our
[1:47:46] knees
[1:47:48] and 5-10 minutes we don't even know what
[1:47:50] to say anymore
[1:47:52] we have exhausted our prayer topics
[1:47:55] so self-centered
[1:47:59] life is just all about us
[1:48:03] and all we are thinking about is just
[1:48:05] working money
[1:48:08] do not let that pin you down
[1:48:12] enjoy it
[1:48:14] don't let it hold you down
[1:48:17] it's good
[1:48:18] but life is better on the other side
[1:48:22] praise be to God
[1:48:24] don't let that hold you down
[1:48:27] so I remember
[1:48:28] when we all gather around the throne
[1:48:31] someday
[1:48:33] it will be time to tell the story
[1:48:37] I think probably that was the last song
[1:48:39] brother Lawrence put up there
[1:48:45] yeah I remember
[1:48:47] the last song
[1:48:49] we sung this morning
[1:48:53] praise be to God
[1:48:55] anyway
[1:48:56] so
[1:48:59] when we all gather around the throne
[1:49:01] someday
[1:49:03] it will be time to tell the story how we
[1:49:06] overcame
[1:49:08] praise be to God
[1:49:10] it will be storytelling time
[1:49:13] and I see
[1:49:16] the Prophet Daniel come
[1:49:19] and he tells his story
[1:49:21] how that he was casting the Lions then
[1:49:24] and Elias came and they couldn't eat him
[1:49:27] up
[1:49:28] because the glory of God was so much
[1:49:31] with him they could even get close
[1:49:35] they say yes to him we read that in the
[1:49:38] Holy scriptures and we were so
[1:49:39] encouraged oh you can't imagine how my
[1:49:43] strength we got from that God bless you
[1:49:47] and then I see Meshach and I bet they
[1:49:51] will come
[1:49:52] they tell you a story
[1:49:54] how that they refused
[1:49:56] the King's Command
[1:49:59] and they were just matched to the very
[1:50:01] furnace
[1:50:03] and they didn't fear they entered there
[1:50:06] and they realized the Lord was with them
[1:50:08] praise be to God oh yes we read about
[1:50:12] that we were walking in the footprints
[1:50:14] God bless you
[1:50:16] what would be your story
[1:50:20] what would be your story
[1:50:25] praise be to God
[1:50:29] can you imagine what your story would be
[1:50:32] when everybody begins to tell your story
[1:50:36] how that God dealt with them
[1:50:39] and the full Prince they left behind
[1:50:43] what would be your story on that day
[1:50:47] leaving behind
[1:50:50] footprints
[1:50:53] leaving behind an Evidence
[1:50:57] that you were here
[1:50:59] that you were not sitting on the fence
[1:51:02] that you are in the arena
[1:51:05] you were fighting
[1:51:08] that is why the Bible says we should
[1:51:10] dress in the whole armor of God
[1:51:14] with the habit of salvation
[1:51:17] the breastplate of righteousness and
[1:51:19] your laws get right about with the
[1:51:22] Gospel of Truth and your feet short in
[1:51:25] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:51:27] and then you have a shield of faith
[1:51:30] and a sword the sword of the spirit
[1:51:35] praise be to God
[1:51:36] you don't dress like this and then go to
[1:51:40] bed
[1:51:40] no as somebody that is at the Forefront
[1:51:43] fighting
[1:51:45] we are called to war
[1:51:48] and when I looked at that scripture I
[1:51:50] didn't see a shift
[1:51:51] a shift is a place you put your sword I
[1:51:55] didn't see a chief
[1:51:57] the sword was not in a shift
[1:52:00] their sword was drawn there was no chief
[1:52:04] we are on the Battlefront
[1:52:07] if you don't find yourself on the
[1:52:09] Battlefront you are going to retreat
[1:52:13] when it gets rough when it gets rough
[1:52:16] you are going to renounce your faith
[1:52:18] you must mean business with God
[1:52:21] until you mean business with God God is
[1:52:24] never going to mean business with you
[1:52:28] praise be to God
[1:52:30] I remember
[1:52:32] one of the dreams I've had
[1:52:38] long ago
[1:52:42] and
[1:52:43] I sobred a team in the dream
[1:52:47] and he was so angry
[1:52:50] came a student looked at me
[1:52:52] and then he turned and he was going
[1:52:54] then I called him
[1:52:56] as a right team you can't just go like
[1:52:59] that
[1:53:00] and then he turned and he came back to
[1:53:02] me
[1:53:03] and this is what he said and I'm quoting
[1:53:05] it
[1:53:06] until you are ready God is not ready
[1:53:10] praise be to God
[1:53:14] so until you are ready God is not ready
[1:53:18] you can't play with the things of God
[1:53:22] and until you mean peace
[1:53:26] you are not just a follower
[1:53:29] you are not sitting on the fence
[1:53:33] the reason why you have a lot to talk
[1:53:34] about and a lot to say about others in
[1:53:38] the arena is because you are on the
[1:53:40] fence
[1:53:41] but when you are in the arena
[1:53:44] with your sojourn
[1:53:46] hey you have some enemies to contend
[1:53:49] with
[1:53:50] you don't even know what is going on on
[1:53:52] the other side
[1:53:56] we are called to war
[1:54:00] and we are going to fight every inch
[1:54:03] along the way
[1:54:05] anywhere God calls you
[1:54:08] that is the end of it

[1:56:20] courage
[1:56:23] the kingdom of God is not for cowards
[1:56:29] who was that writer who says cow was die
[1:56:32] many times before their death
[1:56:34] who was that writer
[1:56:36] yes the kingdom of God is not for
[1:56:38] cowards
[1:56:41] it's for men of value
[1:56:43] be prepared to fight
[1:56:46] you don't know when and where
[1:56:49] when that time comes draw your sword
[1:56:53] the amalekites in your life don't have
[1:56:55] the right to live
[1:56:57] the double size in your life don't have
[1:56:59] the right to live
[1:57:02] draw your sword
[1:57:04] if you don't put them to death they will
[1:57:07] put you to death
[1:57:10] it doesn't matter how big or how small
[1:57:12] they are
[1:57:13] those small things you live in your life
[1:57:16] tomorrow would rope to become the big
[1:57:18] things
[1:57:21] don't spare
[1:57:23] don't spare any evil in your life
[1:57:27] there is no small evil
[1:57:30] don't spare
[1:57:32] don't spare when you draw your sword
[1:57:35] make sure
[1:57:37] you take the head of every single one of
[1:57:39] them
[1:57:42] have you ever seen a woman killing a
[1:57:43] snake before
[1:57:46] here in America I don't even see snakes
[1:57:48] you probably have to go to the zoo to go
[1:57:50] and see one
[1:57:51] but I believe if you kill it they'll
[1:57:52] take you to court
[1:57:59] but somewhere
[1:58:03] where you see them goes but when the
[1:58:04] woman is killing a snake
[1:58:06] they will stand there they'll break
[1:58:09] every single bone in it
[1:58:12] that is what
[1:58:14] should be doing
[1:58:16] to the enemy
[1:58:18] we are the Church of the Living God
[1:58:21] the bride of Christ
[1:58:23] make sure you break every bone in that
[1:58:26] snake
[1:58:28] everything you need
[1:58:31] to make it in this journey
[1:58:34] let's write in there
[1:58:37] it lays right in there
[1:58:45] never take things for granted
[1:58:47] praise be to God we are seven minutes
[1:58:50] away I know if I need more time you guys
[1:58:54] wouldn't mind
[1:58:55] praise be to God I'm even surprised how
[1:58:58] far we have come
[1:59:00] um I just didn't know what was going on
[1:59:03] praise be to God
[1:59:06] yes
[1:59:07] so God is counting on you
[1:59:12] don't let God down
[1:59:14] praise be to God
[1:59:16] God is counting on you seriously
[1:59:19] don't just pass through
[1:59:25] there are no spectators
[1:59:27] in the kingdom of God
[1:59:30] we are all in
[1:59:33] to fight
[1:59:52] so back to the question I was asking a
[1:59:54] few minutes ago
[2:00:01] if God should call you today
[2:00:07] what's going to be
[2:00:10] in the evidence
[2:00:11] that you are here
[2:00:14] would people ever remember
[2:00:17] that you are here
[2:00:21] would people ever remember that you were
[2:00:23] here
[2:00:27] it doesn't have to be something physical
[2:00:31] it doesn't have to be something physical
[2:00:34] if it is fine
[2:00:36] it doesn't have to be
[2:00:42] you living by the life you're living the
[2:00:45] life living by the word of God you
[2:00:47] become an example to others around you
[2:00:51] that they look at your life and they
[2:00:53] take consolation in it they look at your
[2:00:55] life and they see Christ
[2:00:57] people look at your life you have become
[2:00:59] so testy we are the salt of the earth
[2:01:02] people look at your life you have become
[2:01:04] so tasty till they want to see who your
[2:01:07] God is
[2:01:10] you are leaving behind an Evidence
[2:01:13] that you were here
[2:01:15] when you are gone it is something people
[2:01:18] are going to talk about
[2:01:20] you when you are gone is people is
[2:01:24] something that is going to draw people
[2:01:25] to Christ
[2:01:28] anything you do for the kingdom of God
[2:01:31] or for the people of God
[2:01:34] you are living behind a footprint
[2:01:37] that you were here
[2:01:39] you are living an Evidence
[2:01:41] that you were here
[2:01:44] it will never go unrewarded
[2:01:48] when you are standing in the gap for
[2:01:51] others
[2:01:52] that is why intercessory prayer is a
[2:01:55] very very important thing
[2:01:58] sometimes you don't know what it is
[2:02:04] our sharing with somebody one day
[2:02:07] that I was on my way to work
[2:02:10] probably two months ago
[2:02:12] and it has snowed the roads were
[2:02:14] slippery
[2:02:15] and as I was going
[2:02:20] it just came on my heart
[2:02:22] pray for the sister
[2:02:25] so I started praying
[2:02:28] I started praying
[2:02:30] okay
[2:02:31] and in less than two minutes
[2:02:35] I slid
[2:02:38] I made 270 degrees
[2:02:41] and I was facing this way
[2:02:43] I was coming from here I ended up facing
[2:02:45] here
[2:02:47] there were blue traffic's feeding in the
[2:02:50] cars here stopped the cars they stopped
[2:02:53] and I was not moved
[2:02:56] I was not moved nothing
[2:02:59] I just found my way back and I continued
[2:03:02] a prayer
[2:03:04] now you may think that oh it just
[2:03:06] happened because no it was the devil
[2:03:08] that was fighting back
[2:03:11] because when somebody is under attack
[2:03:14] and you are in the Gap you are also
[2:03:16] under attack
[2:03:19] don't think that you are free no
[2:03:22] if somebody is fighting a battle and you
[2:03:25] come in you are also a Target
[2:03:28] that is why you don't have to go in
[2:03:29] unprepared
[2:03:30] go in ready to fight
[2:03:33] when we go on our knees to pray is we
[2:03:36] are at War
[2:03:38] praise be to God and what prayers can do
[2:03:42] my brother said that prayers they depart
[2:03:45] the power that is in prayer is more than
[2:03:47] all the atomic bonso in the world
[2:03:50] there is power in prayer
[2:03:52] when you stand in a gap
[2:03:55] and you are praying even taking time to
[2:03:58] pray for the service before you come
[2:04:00] lifting the people on the field into the
[2:04:03] hands of God
[2:04:05] it is a footprint
[2:04:07] who are living behind
[2:04:10] you are living an evidence that you were
[2:04:13] here
[2:04:13] because when you go on your knees even
[2:04:16] though a brother is not seeing you even
[2:04:18] though a sister is not seeing you even
[2:04:20] though your pastor is not seeing you if
[2:04:22] you know there's nobody looking on
[2:04:24] you shut the kingdom of this Dark Age
[2:04:27] they know that the Son of God or a
[2:04:29] daughter of God is
[2:04:32] and the day you leave this earth God
[2:04:34] takes you away
[2:04:36] the demons know that well something has
[2:04:38] happened
[2:04:41] that Tormentor is gone
[2:04:44] praise be to God
[2:04:47] if God should call you today
[2:04:52] if God should call you today
[2:04:55] what is going to be the evidence
[2:04:58] that you are here
[2:05:02] when you give people encouragement
[2:05:07] you give them hope
[2:05:11] you lift them up
[2:05:14] you help them in their struggles
[2:05:17] you help them in prayer
[2:05:21] you are living behind a footprint
[2:05:25] you are living an Evidence
[2:05:28] when you are gone 10 20 30 40 50 100
[2:05:32] years
[2:05:35] nothing is going to erase it
[2:05:39] it's an Evidence
[2:05:41] that you were here
[2:05:43] praise be to God
[2:05:45] every sacrifice you make for the kingdom
[2:05:48] of God
[2:05:49] is an evidence that you were here
[2:05:53] musicians you can come
[2:05:57] the evidence
[2:05:59] that they were here
[2:06:03] praise be to God
[2:06:06] thank you Jesus
[2:06:10] so you look at your personal life
[2:06:14] nobody is going to answer that for you
[2:06:18] you ask yourself
[2:06:21] what is the evidence
[2:06:23] if I should go tonight what is the
[2:06:26] evidence that I was here
[2:06:29] what are the footprints
[2:06:31] I'm leaving behind
[2:06:34] that posterity
[2:06:36] can look at those footprints
[2:06:40] and remember
[2:06:41] that social and so was here
[2:06:45] praise be to God
[2:06:49] the evidence that they were here
[2:06:54] I want us to go to the Lord in prayer
[2:06:59] the word of God would never go out
[2:07:03] and return unto him void
[2:07:07] whatever the word is meant to do
[2:07:11] white would do it nothing can stop it
[2:07:14] [Music]
[2:07:16] I don't know what you're going through
[2:07:21] this is far away from what I was just
[2:07:24] going to talk about today
[2:07:26] as I said from the beginning
[2:07:30] but God has a reason for everything
[2:07:35] I don't know
[2:07:37] how God touched your life
[2:07:41] I don't know what you're going through
[2:07:42] what you are dealing with
[2:07:45] but I believe
[2:07:48] that we went this way for a good cause
[2:07:53] I want us to talk to God tonight talk to
[2:07:55] God this afternoon
[2:07:58] as for more of his grace
[2:08:00] in the areas of Our Lives we know we are
[2:08:03] not doing well
[2:08:05] in the areas of Our Lives we know we
[2:08:08] have fallen shorts
[2:08:11] in the areas of our life that we are not
[2:08:13] proud of
[2:08:16] this we are still dealing with
[2:08:18] that we know are contrary to the word of
[2:08:21] God
[2:08:22] I want us to revisit to revisit Our
[2:08:26] Lives
[2:08:27] this afternoon
[2:08:28] and talk to God
[2:08:30] to God
[2:08:32] whenever the word of God comes
[2:08:35] and you can feel God talking to you
[2:08:37] knocking on the door of your heart
[2:08:39] there is enough Grace enough Grace to
[2:08:43] change circumstances in your life
[2:08:48] if there is any time to talk to God that
[2:08:51] is the time
[2:08:53] if there is any time to ask for anything
[2:08:56] from God that is the time
[2:08:59] if there is any time to endlessly seek
[2:09:01] the face of God that is the time
[2:09:04] not when you go home
[2:09:06] that is fine
[2:09:08] but how about now

[2:16:58] anymore
[2:17:01] if we are not taking away by death we
[2:17:04] could be taken away by spiritual death
[2:17:06] that we have crossed that land of
[2:17:08] Separation that we can no more hear that
[2:17:10] warning Blazer that is in our ears and
