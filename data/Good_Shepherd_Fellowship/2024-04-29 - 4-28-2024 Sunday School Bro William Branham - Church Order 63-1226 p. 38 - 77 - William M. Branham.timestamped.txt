[0:00] [Music]
[0:44] then they have a Ministry together for
[0:48] the
[0:49] church now that isn't the ministry of
[0:51] brother
[0:53] naille that's your ministry to the
[0:55] church I'm giving this as example then
[0:59] you Brethren should be just as
[1:00] interested in getting your ministry in
[1:04] the place in the house of God as a
[1:07] pastor is interested in getting his
[1:10] because it's just essential that you do
[1:12] it but you can't do it in the privacy of
[1:15] your own room if you speak and you
[1:17] interpret you've got to come
[1:20] together now come together in the church
[1:24] off in a room to yourself because you
[1:27] have a private Ministry it's not an
[1:29] openly Ministry it's one that's to help
[1:32] the church see it's something to help
[1:35] the church but it isn't to be done in
[1:36] the main congregation only the way I'm
[1:39] going to tell you is to be done see then
[1:42] whatever brother Collins speaks and
[1:45] brother Hickerson gives the
[1:46] interpretation as example then let
[1:50] brother uh somebody write this down what
[1:54] it
[1:55] is and
[1:58] then if it's coming now we all know that
[2:02] the Lord is coming we're aware of
[2:05] that and if brother Neville got up each
[2:07] night and said behold the Lord is coming
[2:10] behold the Lord is coming that would be
[2:12] all right see but he's saying that the
[2:16] pastor at the platform for he's got the
[2:19] word for that and if he be a pastor
[2:23] Prophet to the church or Pastor rather
[2:26] he us to study the word of the Lord and
[2:28] tell you what's written in the word of
[2:30] the Lord about the coming of the Lord
[2:32] and you're warned by
[2:34] that a Ministry otherwise to the church
[2:38] which he wouldn't have any connection
[2:39] with is tongues interpretation of
[2:42] tongues which is prophecy or a prophet
[2:45] speaking that something is not written
[2:47] in the
[2:49] word what's written in the word he's to
[2:51] bring it but what's not written in the
[2:54] word is what you here to tell him like
[2:56] for instance uh tell um a brother whe
[3:00] of thus sayeth the Lord tomorrow in his
[3:03] sand pit not to go to it because you'll
[3:05] be a truck turnover or something like
[3:07] that it's got to be done and you've
[3:09] spoken and he's interpreted and then lay
[3:12] that on the platform after your ministry
[3:14] is finished the other night after the
[3:16] church the hymn starts singing and so
[3:18] forth if your ministry is finished then
[3:21] let them come forth with what prophecy
[3:23] has been
[3:24] given and I do not think that we have or
[3:28] if you do put this in there when these
[3:30] people meet together let them who have
[3:32] wisdom first come because you see if one
[3:36] speaks in tongues and gives an
[3:38] interpretation according to scripture
[3:40] that cannot be received unless it be uh
[3:43] witnessed by two or three people two or
[3:45] three more witnesses see that's to
[3:48] witness to that that they believe it to
[3:49] be the word of the Lord because
[3:52] sometimes in these minor Ministries just
[3:54] like in any other Ministry you get
[3:56] Spirits that's wrong see they'll fly in
[3:58] there and we don't want
[4:00] that no we want these Ministries ready
[4:03] to be exposed if they're to be exposed
[4:06] because anything of God can don't worry
[4:08] about exposing it it'll it'll stand the
[4:10] test if it's of God it's like the pastor
[4:13] if somebody challenges him on the word
[4:15] he don't have to back up about it you
[4:17] know it's just exactly what he's talking
[4:18] to come on up here see and same as these
[4:21] other Ministries got to be the same way
[4:23] now if if one speaks in tongues and
[4:26] gives a message now some people speak in
[4:28] tongues when they're just edifying
[4:31] themselves the Bible said they just have
[4:33] a good time to speak in tongues they
[4:35] feel and they do speak in tongues they
[4:37] actually speak with tongues and it's the
[4:39] spirit doing it but if it's sitting out
[4:42] there in the audience speaking in
[4:44] tongues just edifying themselves then it
[4:47] isn't any profitable thing for the
[4:49] church the man's edifying himself or the
[4:51] woman or whoever is doing it see to
[4:54] speak in tongues as a gift of God to
[4:57] edification as Paul says in the
[4:59] scripture
[5:00] that it's to edify the church so it had
[5:02] to be some direct message from God to
[5:04] the church outside of what's wrote here
[5:07] in the
[5:08] Bible see it's something if you could
[5:11] ask me uh brother brandom uh how must I
[5:14] be baptized I can tell you right quick
[5:16] you don't have to speak in tongues and
[5:17] tell me that it's wrote right here in
[5:18] the Bible what to do about that see I
[5:21] don't have to you don't have to ask no
[5:22] questions on that have somebody speak in
[5:24] tongues and tell you see that's already
[5:27] written but if you say brother Brandon
[5:29] uh what must I do I've got a decision
[5:32] here I've got to make whether I should
[5:35] uh take this church or go to another
[5:37] church or something like that or should
[5:38] I do this now that have to come from God
[5:42] see God has to tell us that but that
[5:44] would have to come to another Ministry
[5:46] because the word don't say let arm and
[5:49] Neville leave brandom Tabernacle and go
[5:51] to the pwing Gospel Tabernacle see they
[5:54] don't say that in the word here see so
[5:56] that's what these gifts are for like a
[5:59] person come up up here and say you
[6:00] believe in Divine Healing we preach that
[6:02] we believe it we believe in KN and the
[6:04] all but here some man says he can't get
[6:06] through what's the matter then it takes
[6:08] God through tongues interpretation
[6:10] through prophecy or some way to go down
[6:13] in that man's life and pull out that
[6:15] thing that he's done and tell him about
[6:17] that's a Ministry that doesn't belong to
[6:20] the pastor it belongs to these
[6:22] ministering gifts but they're not to be
[6:25] done out there in the audience see now
[6:28] Paul never one time had to tell those
[6:30] tell those Ephesian Church anything
[6:32] about that they were in order the Roman
[6:35] church or none of those other churches
[6:37] only the Corinthian Church and they
[6:39] never could get themselves now Paul
[6:41] believed in speaking in tongues he had
[6:44] speak in tongues in the Ephesian church
[6:45] as same as he did in the Corinthian
[6:47] Church see but he could speak to the
[6:50] Ephesians greater things than what just
[6:53] speaking in tongues interpretive tongues
[6:56] now then if someone writes a message
[6:59] message that's been given in tongues or
[7:01] given in Prophecy and laid upon the
[7:03] platform it must be read by the pastor
[7:07] before the service starts of thus saith
[7:11] the Lord from these people who spoke and
[7:13] interpreted and if that comes to pass
[7:16] exactly the way the interpretation said
[7:18] we raise our hands and give thanks to
[7:20] God for his Spirit among us if it
[7:22] doesn't come to pass then don't do it
[7:26] anymore to that evil spirit's out of you
[7:29] God don't like lie is always truth then
[7:32] you see you're old enough now to act
[7:35] like man not children goo goo goo you
[7:38] got to have some meaning to something
[7:41] Let the church now as it's com in order
[7:43] come to this
[7:44] order if one prophesy if one come among
[7:48] you unlearned and you speak in tongues
[7:51] you'll be a barbarian to him he don't
[7:53] know what you're talking about see and
[7:55] really in this day where there's been so
[7:57] much confusion about it it causes a
[7:59] stumbling do but let one speak in
[8:01] tongues and another interpret and give
[8:04] the message and let it be read off right
[8:05] here at the platform of what's going to
[8:07] take place and then let it happen see
[8:09] what happened tell them that tomorrow at
[8:12] a certain time or next week at a certain
[8:13] time it's going to be a certain thing
[8:15] then let the unbeliever sitting there
[8:17] listen to that and see it's foretold
[8:19] before it happens then they'll know what
[8:21] kind of spirit's among you it'll be
[8:23] God's spirit that's why Paul said that
[8:25] if one can prophesy and reveal the
[8:29] secret things won't the whole
[8:31] congregation fall down to the unbeliever
[8:34] and say God is in the midst of you see
[8:37] because it cannot be but now we don't
[8:39] want when we was a child Paul said I
[8:41] acted like a child he told the
[8:43] Corinthians there I spoke like a child
[8:46] he had a child mind but when I become an
[8:48] adult I put childish things away now I'm
[8:53] telling you all see a few years ago you
[8:56] were children with these gifts playing
[8:58] back and forth
[9:00] but you've been to a long school now
[9:03] it's time to be man not use these just
[9:06] to play with these gifts are sacred
[9:09] they're of God and you don't play with
[9:11] them let's let God use them that's what
[9:14] your ministry wants to be that's the way
[9:16] to put the brandom Tabernacle in the
[9:19] service and and if this is questioned
[9:21] anytime let this tape stand as a witness
[9:25] that's the way it's to be done in the
[9:26] brandom Tabernacle if there would be a
[9:28] stranger come in cuz you have them all
[9:31] the time because this been an inter
[9:33] denominational Tabernacle there's people
[9:34] come in that doesn't have this well
[9:36] training they don't have it they don't
[9:38] know better in their own pastors they'll
[9:39] jump right up and break his message up
[9:41] and tear alter call up and speak in
[9:43] tongues and everything like that you're
[9:44] a better trained man in that see then
[9:48] after the service if he gets unruly then
[9:50] it's a Deacon's place to go to them
[9:52] don't let your pastor have to do it let
[9:55] it comes to a spot where there's no
[9:56] Deacon here but a deacon is supposed to
[9:58] see to that see now after the service if
[10:01] the person just raises up and gives a
[10:02] message the pastor if he wants to stop
[10:05] just a minute go ahead very well see
[10:07] that's up to the pastor but then
[10:09] immediately let the Deacon before that
[10:11] person gets out of the building take
[10:12] them to one
[10:14] side and talk to them about it and if
[10:17] they question it bring him to this tape
[10:19] and say this is what the bishop or the
[10:21] overseer of the church which is Bishop
[10:23] the any overseer that's what it's called
[10:25] in the Bible the bishop PR see so that's
[10:27] General overseer the church let this is
[10:29] the ERS and way our church does it now
[10:31] we love for you come give your a message
[10:33] but if you've got a message from the
[10:35] Lord and it's let it be given come up
[10:38] here and lay it on our platform and our
[10:41] Minister will read it to the
[10:42] congregation a message to this
[10:44] congregation but it must not be just
[10:47] repeating scriptures and things like
[10:48] that it must be a direct message to the
[10:52] people of something that's fixing to
[10:54] take place or something they should do
[10:55] is it understood all right now is there
[10:59] any better way to keep order in the
[11:02] church than to uh keep uh reminding the
[11:06] people uh with
[11:10] a uh repeat from the deacons
[11:16] accordingly no that I just explained
[11:19] that that's question number three the
[11:22] deacons your duty is to keep order in
[11:25] the church with
[11:27] kindness friendliness
[11:29] and then you are supposed to if someone
[11:33] gets out of order in the church or comes
[11:35] in here like a drunk or somebody come in
[11:36] like the shot that Minister out of the
[11:38] platform of night of there you heard
[11:39] about that that drunk coming in with a
[11:41] double barrel shotgun scream for his
[11:44] wife and and wanted I went up towards
[11:47] the pastor and and the pastor showed him
[11:49] his wife sitting there but he's going to
[11:51] shootter right in the church and the
[11:52] pastor started dealing with him instead
[11:55] of uh instead of the U uh the man with a
[11:59] shotgun turned around shot the pastor
[12:01] out of the pull pit and then shot his
[12:03] wife and then shot himself now if there
[12:05] had been a bunch of deacons there when
[12:06] that man entered that door that shotgun
[12:08] that had their arms the shotgun out of
[12:10] his hand see see that's that's orderly
[12:12] deacons and now these things have gone
[12:15] the way they're doing now you might just
[12:17] expect anything but remember the deacons
[12:20] are God's policemen in the house of God
[12:25] no matter what anybody else thinks
[12:28] sometimes a policeman won't have to go
[12:29] make AR rest on somebody maybe one of
[12:31] his friends but he swore to an office
[12:34] he's got to do it anyhow that's his duty
[12:37] to his City see that's the duty of a
[12:41] deacon to the church and U if uh someone
[12:45] jumps up and starts interrupting the
[12:47] pastor or something like that and a
[12:49] pastor in his message the Deacon's
[12:51] forced to walk up to them people two or
[12:53] three of them say could we speak to you
[12:55] brother see bring him from the church
[12:58] out in the office in here or some other
[13:00] office and speak to him about it say you
[13:03] not to interrupt you know it's a it's a
[13:05] great fine by the law to interrupt a
[13:07] service anyhow but some people such as a
[13:11] delinquent person or something come
[13:12] among you know and some religious
[13:14] fanatic and and start carrying on and
[13:17] the deacons and if and if the deacons
[13:19] don't seem to be able to control it then
[13:21] the trustee board or anyone else in the
[13:23] church can step up and give help to such
[13:25] a person you know that and U and now let
[13:28] me ask a question second here is there
[13:30] any better way to keep order in the
[13:32] church than to re remind the people with
[13:37] a repeat from the
[13:39] deacons now occasionally now I think
[13:44] that the the pastor ever so often or
[13:48] play this tap let that stand for a
[13:51] witness
[13:52] deacons are
[13:55] policemen and their word is Law and
[13:58] Order
[13:59] hey and they have the authority from the
[14:02] church and even from the laws of the
[14:05] nation to make that house of God be the
[14:09] right place and anyone to contrary a
[14:12] deacon like that is subject to 2 to 10
[14:16] years in federal
[14:19] prison if you tell them to go and they
[14:22] don't do it or something like that
[14:23] somebody with this hardly conduct you
[14:25] just don't know what he's doing to he's
[14:28] subject self rival on himself to all
[14:30] kinds of fines any and then if it comes
[14:33] to a spot that somebody and I like and
[14:36] somebody jumps up and get this already
[14:37] just maybe speak in tongues or something
[14:39] I wouldn't go in on that see let them go
[14:41] because if they're a stranger if they
[14:43] are our own people then just let the
[14:45] next night you deacons just get this tap
[14:47] and say now we're going to play the
[14:49] orders of the church before we start to
[14:50] service I want everybody to understand
[14:52] it you pastors and you all can work
[14:54] together like that now brother BR what
[14:58] about about the Sunday
[15:00] School um brother bam about the Sunday
[15:03] School all right should it be before the
[15:07] preaching
[15:08] service yes we've always had it that way
[15:11] have the Sunday school before the
[15:12] preaching service and um that gives a
[15:15] chance for the little fellas who T
[15:17] Sunday school to dismiss their classes
[15:19] and and if they want little fellas don't
[15:22] understand it they have to sit all the
[15:23] way through the preaching service and
[15:24] then have Sunday school the little
[15:25] fellas are wore out let the Sunday
[15:28] School be first first have a set time
[15:30] just at one set time that Sunday school
[15:33] goes to session Sunday school
[15:35] superintendent is supposed to see that
[15:37] at this Sunday school goes to session at
[15:39] a certain time set time and it's
[15:42] dismissed at a certain time all the
[15:44] Sunday School allow so much time for
[15:46] that man dismissed should the teacher
[15:48] for the adult class be someone other
[15:50] than the pastor if it's so agreed if the
[15:54] pastor wants to teach the Sunday school
[15:55] and then bring the message later that's
[15:57] fine and dandy if he wants to do the
[15:59] double service but if he doesn't then
[16:02] have your adult Sunday school teacher
[16:04] see for your Adult class and then if uh
[16:07] if the uh Pastor uh has somebody else
[16:10] there in mind and the person wants to do
[16:12] it give yourself 30 minutes or whatever
[16:14] you're going to allow your Sunday School
[16:15] 4 30 35 40 minutes whatever it is and
[16:18] there should be a bell set you and when
[16:20] that Bell is tapped that means or either
[16:23] the church bell when it Taps on the
[16:25] outside that's dismissing Sunday school
[16:28] and when that bell rings that mean
[16:30] everything come to order right there
[16:32] there' be so much time then for a himym
[16:35] or two whatever you were to sing not too
[16:37] much time you wear the people out but
[16:39] keeping them too long see and U just tap
[16:42] the Bell have a hymn and whatever you're
[16:45] going to do and then send your classes
[16:46] to the place and immediately when that
[16:48] time comes say it's going to be at at
[16:50] 10:00 or 10:30 or 10:15 whatever it is
[16:53] tap that Bell andever teacher dismisses
[16:56] or CL come to the audience out here and
[16:58] then and give the report Sunday school
[17:00] report and then dismiss the whole thing
[17:03] and let all that wants to stay for
[17:05] preaching service be next and it's an
[17:08] AR
[17:11] question how me have a spit class not
[17:14] words oh yes you should have a
[17:16] three-year-old can't understand what a
[17:18] 14-year-old would understand I think I
[17:20] got that a little farther how many
[17:22] classes should there
[17:23] be you should put your classes and like
[17:27] a little bitty class that wants to have
[17:29] flannel graph that's too much for a
[17:31] 14-year-old boy or girl see you should
[17:34] have a someone to take a class for those
[17:37] little babies some old mother or
[17:38] something who knows how to take care of
[17:40] other classes I think U should be uh
[17:44] some body who's more uh able to present
[17:48] the word see and uh there should be
[17:51] classes to say how to be like a class of
[17:54] from the at least three classes there
[17:56] should be a little bitty baby class
[17:58] there should be be from about 5 years
[18:00] old and all the others under that should
[18:02] be kept with a mother and taken in the
[18:04] nursery if necessary during the time of
[18:06] the preaching if they go carrying on
[18:08] that's what the nurser is out there for
[18:11] and I think that the the classes should
[18:13] be range from like the little babies
[18:15] about five or 6 years old up to8 or nine
[18:19] 10 something like that and then from 10
[18:21] years old on to 15 should be in the
[18:24] teenage class and then the adult class
[18:26] over at 15 CU they if they're old enough
[18:30] nowadays they can get a job and they're
[18:31] wan to vote at that age almost so they
[18:33] they should be able to hear the word but
[18:36] come out in the main Auditorium and have
[18:41] that uh who should be the teachers there
[18:43] you are that's up to you to vote your
[18:45] own teachers in and you ought to do that
[18:47] put them in there get somebody and meet
[18:49] with the church and say uh who's uh who
[18:52] here feels LED of the Lord and then get
[18:54] a qualified teacher and then let it be
[18:56] done it's got to be strictly business
[18:58] brother if the teacher can't qualify to
[19:01] it then change
[19:02] teachers when the time comes is under
[19:05] God if I be like an arm and Neville
[19:06] can't no more qualifi to be Pastor here
[19:09] I'm going to mention it to the
[19:12] church when i' see one thing here think
[19:14] it you deacons couldn't qualify to be
[19:16] deacons I would have mentioned to the
[19:17] church I find out there's a certain
[19:19] Deacon out here doing something he
[19:21] shouldn't do and he doesn't keep his
[19:22] post to duty and so forth like that or a
[19:24] trustee or whatever it is I can't build
[19:26] it in or out the church has to do that
[19:28] but I'm certainly go to present it
[19:29] before the church okay because that's
[19:32] what it should do that's what I'm
[19:33] supposed to be as overseer I'm supposed
[19:35] to look and see what's going on we're
[19:37] going to heaven not out here somewhere
[19:40] to Rally or something to have a lot of
[19:42] fun and run over one another and play
[19:44] baseball we're here handling the most
[19:46] gracious thing there is on Earth the
[19:48] word of God is be carried on in Godly

[20:04] teenagers i' take some teacher that's
[20:07] strict and not just going out here and
[20:09] having weer roast that' be all right if

[20:16] hold the word and it's going to be this
[20:18] church stands not for uh weer roaster

[20:23] you want to go together in Fellowship

[20:28] this place in here this is a word of God
[20:31] wi roast is when you get together
[20:33] something like that but not in this
[20:35] house of God and these no of course we
[20:38] know we don't believe in this year
[20:39] foolishness of of parties and everything
[20:43] like that around here we we you know
[20:44] better than that who should be over the
[20:48] Sunday School to keep it in order the
[20:50] Sunday School
[20:52] Superintendent that's what his business
[20:54] is he's not supposed to have anything to
[20:57] do with the deacons trustees pastors or
[20:59] nobody else he's got an office of his
[21:00] own whoever your Sunday school teacher
[21:02] is I know not that Sunday school teacher
[21:05] is supposed to see that every class is
[21:07] in its place and every teacher is
[21:10] present or substitute another teacher
[21:12] for that teacher if they're not there on
[21:13] that date then just before the Sunday
[21:16] while the lessons are going on this
[21:18] Sunday school superintendent is to go by
[21:20] and take up the offerings that they've
[21:23] had in there their Sunday school
[21:24] Collections and the report of how many
[21:26] present how many bibles they had in this
[21:28] class and so forth and make a report of
[21:30] it and then stand before the audience
[21:32] just before the preaching service when
[21:33] he's give the spot to do it when they
[21:35] have the Sunday School uh report after
[21:37] the Sunday school is over tell how many
[21:38] teachers how many present how many the
[21:41] whole Sunday school total the whole C
[21:42] total of offerings and so forth like
[21:45] deacons trustees pastors are not
[21:48] supposed to do that they have nothing to
[21:49] do into it that is the Sunday School
[21:51] superintendent's job and then if he sees
[21:55] that the Sunday School needs certain
[21:56] things then he is to present sent that
[21:59] to the U uh uh to the trustee board and
[22:04] the trustees has a meeting up on it
[22:06] first and then the trustees if they find
[22:09] that there is sufficient funds and so
[22:12] forth through the treasure then this can
[22:14] be purchased if he wants something there
[22:15] for literature or whatever it is or some
[22:17] Bibles or something they want to buy a
[22:19] Bible for uh the one you know it can uh
[22:22] find the most words and quote the most
[22:24] scripture or some Prize or something
[22:26] they go to give away like that or
[22:27] something they want to buy buy it to the
[22:29] church then let that be presented to the
[22:31] to the to the um the deacons and then
[22:35] let them find out if it's if it's if
[22:37] it's in the Treasure see and that I
[22:40] think that takes care of them five
