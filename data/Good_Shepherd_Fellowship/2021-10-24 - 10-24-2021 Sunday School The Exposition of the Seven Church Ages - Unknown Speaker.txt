========================================
[Music] do so fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life every time the lord uses those words fear not there is an engagement at hand which will involve great danger and suffering and deprivation now he does not say in a blonde curt manner tribulation is coming that would frighten one but like a mother who is about to turn out the light says gently to her child lest he be frightened now don't be afraid for the light will go out and it will be dark but remember that i am here with you so he says don't be afraid of man or what he can do to you i am with you and my grace is sufficient for you when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you not even in death are you defeated you are more than conquerors the great apostle paul knew from experience the reality of those words and he wrote in romans 8 35-59 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord no we are not to fear his love casts out all fear now notice what he says the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried the jews were doing that right then the pagan priests were doing that right then the governors who tried to curry favor with the public because the people liked the arena hurled the christians by the thousands to their death destroying them by lions and gladiators what has the devil to do with this why blame him ah yes but it is the devil's hatred behind it all he is behind it all for he hates god what god has set his heart on satan is bound to try to destroy but watch here is some illumination if satan is behind the jews who are hailing the christians into court then the jews are not of god's religion but the devils their gathering is also of the synagogue of satan and if the roman catholic church killed the multitudes of believers in the dark ages yes and in all ages then they are of the devil and belong to satan also and if you think this is shocking just wait until the prophecy of revelation 13 is fulfilled it is strikingly true that the united states of america is in that chapter the very number 13 is a symbol of this nation it started with 13 colonies its flag has 13 stars and 13 stripes and there is her destiny in the 13th chapter in this image that is mentioned in this chapter will be found all the wickedness of the beast that was before it as the beast rose at the nicene council so the image will come out of the world council of churches with all ungodly and satanic power to vent the anger of the devil upon the true vine of god it will be a repeat performance of all diabolical cunning and cruelty those who fight the humble of god and scoff and destroy let them do it and do it they will and all in the name of god and religion but they lie they are not of god they are of their father the devil they by their deeds against any people expose themselves for what they are let them organize and repudiate the little flock they but further reveal to all that they are of the devil they are the false vine the vine that murders their hatred proves who they are the nicolaitan antichrist church is who they are they shall be cast into prison yes they are hailed into court and falsely accused and tried and imprisoned and of course it is all done in the name of religion and decency and outraged innocency all done for a good cause that makes me think of the supreme court's ruling on prayer and bible reading in the schools who is behind it satan is it is just another angry outburst against god thou shalt have tribulation ten days here is a prophecy and with it is a means of determining the lifespan of the smyrnian age diocletian the cruelest of all emperors launched a terror campaign against the saints of god but except for the mercy of god would have wiped out all believers it was the bloodiest in history and lasted 10 years the 10 days of revelation 2 10 be from 302 to 312 be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yeah millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives dear unto death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to triumph in christ jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all martyrs the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour blessed be god forever and i will give thee a crown of life since not even a cup of cold water given in the name of the lord fails to receive a reward how great shall be the reward to him who gives his life as a martyr for the name of the lord jesus perhaps we can get a small idea if we compare this crown with the crown one in a race in first corinthians 9 24 paul says know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain a crown given to the winner of the olympic race was a garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of here in the revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty jesus calls it the crown of life the one crown is for those who have striven the other is for those who have given both crowns are incorruptable they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plaudits of the world their glory will fail but those who give their lives for god either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the crown of life all too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of god the recompense of god is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good treasures that are available to the faithful saints the reward for overcoming revelation 2 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death now once again the spirit is talking to all the ages this message is to comfort us today even as it has comforted our brethren of all the other ages and he says to us that the second death will not hurt us we all know that the second death is the lake of fire revelation 20 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death of course that means all those who were therein were cast into the lake of fire now then i want to bring out something here for you it no doubt will cause people to comment on my strange doctrine but i stand here on the authority of the word of god and deny that the unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and burns there eternally in the first place hell or the lake of fire or whatever you want to call it is not eternal how can it be if it had a beginning in matthew 25 41 it says that everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels now if it was prepared then it wasn't without a beginning if it had a beginning then it can't be eternal of course you might stumble over the idea of the word everlasting but that word means from the ages to the ages and has different meanings attached to it in first samuel 3 13-14 god told samuel that he was going to judge the house of eli forever and that they would offer no more sacrifices forever as his priests and in second kings 2 27 solomon thrust out the last descendants of eli from the priesthood that was four generations or so later now you can see that everlasting does not compare with what is eternal or that which had no beginning or end here in this case the word everlasting means to the vanishing point that is what happened they vanished look at the word destruction over in second thessalonians 1 9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction in the greek destruction positively means annihilation and the word destruction does not mean destroying now destroying means something going on and on in decay so what can everlasting annihilation mean it doesn't mean to keep on annihilating or that would make the word destroying instead of destruction it means to destroy to the ending point ended you might wonder now when you can use that word eternal and not use it the way we have been taught that is easy when it applies to god it means to be without beginning or end and ever enduring and never ceasing and when you talk of eternal life you have that in mind which is the life of god this is the record that god has given us eternal life and that life is in the sun he that hath the son hath life now then only sons of god have life eternal the kind that never had a beginning but always was that is right you have something in you right now that is eternal without beginning or end it is the spirit of god it is a part of god himself it is the life of god now if a sinner is going to go to hell and then suffer the same as you are going to heaven and enjoy heaven then he has the same kind of life you have already well then there might be those who say eternal life signifies the welfare of the children of god it is their welfare and enjoyment that is at stake on the other hand the sinner goes to his punishment so that we can reduce the second death to a matter of punishment and place eternal life means heaven and eternal punishment means hell you would be surprised at the men who have been exalted as theologians that believed that but do you know what that does it makes eternal life a matter of geography instead of a person eternal life is god the lord jesus christ how anyone could believe such a thing that eternal life is a matter of place is more than i know it makes me stagger to think of it no sir there is only one kind of eternal life god has it if we have god we have eternal life in and through him so you see that word eternal or everlasting can be applied in various ways but when it applies to god he being what he is it has one meaning it is the duration of god you can't apply it like that to any other thing god alone is eternal and because he lives we live with him now don't let anyone say that i don't believe in a lake of fire and in punishment i do i don't know how long it will last but it will eventually be removed in revelation 21 8 it says that those sinners mentioned will have their part in the lake of fire but the true interpretation of the word is not part but it is time see there you have it so the wicked shall be cast into hell hades or the grave and hell into the lake of fire separated from god what a terrible thing that will be but with the righteous it shall not be so they don't have to fear they have been redeemed by god they are in his bosom they are the overcomers and who is he that overcometh he that believeth that jesus is the christ why will this overcomer this believer escape and go into realms of eternal life and bliss because jesus paid a price to ransom us from sin he filled the gap of separation and we who were afar off are now made nigh by the blood and they will never come into condemnation they will never be in that lake of fire they can never be lost for he will lose none of them not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where jesus is do you know why that is i'll illustrate it for you i have a little boy joseph he is a part of me no matter what happens if i were a rich man the worst i could do would be to disinherit him but there is nothing that i can ever do to deny him i can't because he is a part of me here let's take a blood test let's match his blood with mine it'll prove that joseph is my son he is mine it's the blood test that shows whether you belong to god or not i can't help thinking of the time that i used to ride heard on purebred herefords out in colorado we used to have to bring in those cattle for government inspection if we wanted them to feed on government range but they would not allow one single animal that did not have the blood tag on the ear the tag signified that it was purebred the rangers that looked them over did not once look at the brand they just looked at the tag to see that the blood was the right blood hallelujah if it's the right blood it's got to be right you know god looked down and declared the soul that sinneth it shall die it is separated from me it can't approach unto me we know that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god that meant that all died all were separated and one day a time would come when even that bit of life would be snuffed out and it would be all over but god in love took an animal and took its life in the place of the sinner's life in the old testament the sinner brought a lamb he placed his hand on the lamb while the priest cut the lamb's throat he felt the bleeding and heard the bleeding he felt the body stiffen in death he saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood ascend to god he knew that the lamb had taken his place he knew that the lamb's life had been forfeited for his but the life of that lamb was animal life and it could not come back upon the sinner making him clean so he left with the same desire to sin he would go out with sin in his mind and come back and offer a sacrifice for the same thing a year later but in the new testament it is not so our dying lamb is the son of god who gave his blood a ransom for many by faith we walk up and place our hands upon that lamb we see him with the bloody wounds the lacerated back the cruel thorns tearing his brow we feel his pain and hear him cry my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and what happened the life that left that broken blood cell came back upon the repentant one the life that was in him came back upon us we go back with no more desire to sin and we now possess a hatred for the works and lusts of the flesh look at us what is our life just one little cell that came from our father the female does not have the hemoglobin she produces the egg she is the incubator but the blood comes from the male that is why the woman takes the man's name the children take his name the mother is the incubator for the children she bears him that is what happened for our redemption the holy ghost came upon mary and she bore a son and called him jesus the great creator came down and became a sacrifice for our sin his blood was the blood of god that is exactly what it was that blood of god was shed and the spirit left him as he died in agony then the same life spirit came back to indwell the repentant sinner and set him free that sinner did not come back year after year sacrifice after sacrifice for there was no need by one sacrifice once and for all he has been set free from the dominion of sin and has received the life of christ whereby he reigns in victory over sin the world the flesh and the devil god did it he did it all he cried out to the world cursed in sin i will give you a sign a virgin shall be with child a virgin shall conceive and bear a son that will be your sign it will be an everlasting sign what she brings forth will be emmanuel god with us god came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy ghost and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our salvation when the holy ghost came upon mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of god that is who jesus is and that holy one was filled with holy blood even the blood of god that tabernacle came to birth he grew to be a man he went to jordan and there that sacrifice was washed of john in the river called jordan when that acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water god came and indwelt him filling him with the spirit without measure and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of god was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept the christ as his savior oh how striking it is jehovah born crying over a manure pile jehovah born in a manger of straw there is your everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved their own theology and denied the truth of god jehovah god a crying baby in a stinking barn then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our noses criticizing and acting as though we were somebody here's your real sign this is the right one jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working in a carpenter's shop jehovah washing the feet of fishermen i'll give you a sign said god not the sign of a white-collared priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you will want or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign of all jehovah's standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face mocked and set out not jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while the hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross jehovah dying jehovah praying and nothing happening then jehovah died that is the sign for all men now there isn't another like it it is the great one then darkness came upon the earth they put him in a tomb there he lay those three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the gloom of night and he came forth jehovah came forth jehovah ascended on high then jehovah returned to indwell his church jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and empower his people once more jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and again jehovah heals the sick raises the dead and manifests himself by the spirit jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation jehovah came down and he raised the prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with fly blows on his face as he lay unconscious in the gutter yes jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh jehovah came god in us the hope of glory yes jesus came and shed his blood and set the captive free he came and redeemed his lost sheep he gave them eternal life and they shall never perish he won't lose one of them but raise them up at the last day hallelujah the second death cannot hurt them it has no power over them for they are the lambs and they follow him wherever he goes the holy spirit in every age revelation 2 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches there is not one church age where this verse is not mentioned every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith but it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages first corinthians 2 6-16 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ matthew 13 13-16 therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear john 8 42-44 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word you are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it it is most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear god that ability has to be given him of god matthew 16 17 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven putting these verses together we see that there is only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age it is one special group that receives the revelation for each age that group is of god because the group that cannot hear is not of god john 8 42-44 the group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the revelation thereof is that group described in first corinthians 2 6-16 they are the ones who have the spirit of god they are the ones that are born of god they are baptized into the body of the lord jesus christ by his spirit they are baptized with the holy ghost to further bring out what we have just said and to also use a scripture that should be borne in mind as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the holy ghost see what jesus says in john 6 45 it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of god but turn to isaiah 54 13 whence this is taken and it reads and all thy children shall be taught of the lord the all of god are the children of god thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of god he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the holy ghost now you can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost it doesn't say in any age that he that hath a tongue let him say what the spirit is saying that puts tongues interpretation thereof and prophecy etc aside as an evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching that is exactly what jesus said he would do when he came john 14 26 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you and that is just what happened that is how the gospels were written these men had recalled to their minds by the holy ghost the very words that jesus spake that is why the gospels are accurate they are perfect but the spirit did not only bring all things to their minds but he taught them further on the truth they already had that is how paul received his revelations he said concerning it but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it of man but by the revelation of jesus christ galatians 1 11-12 he was taught by the holy ghost one day when jesus was upon earth a certain important man came to visit him this man said rabbi we know you are a teacher sent from god but you will notice that jesus cut him short he turned to nicodemus and the words he spoke may well be paraphrased thusly i am not a teacher i am the sacrificial lamb for sin i am making possible the new birth by my spirit but there is a coming one who is the teacher he is the holy spirit when jesus was upon the earth he came as the lamb and as the prophet but when he came back upon the church by his spirit he became the teacher and to every age we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth to the churches but only a spirit-filled man can hear the revelation for that age none other can no sir they cannot because that is exactly what paul said in first corinthians two six through sixteen now this ought to make you rejoice there is a most peculiar doctrine in the air that is causing much misunderstanding and hard feelings for when the pentecostals say you must speak in tongues or you haven't been baptized with the holy ghost they are either denying that great men like knox moody taylor go forth and others did not receive the holy ghost or saying that they all secretly spoke in tongues and were not aware of what was going on now that is not true no sir that is gross error tongues are not the evidence of being spirit-filled it is simply one of the nine manifestations mentioned in first corinthians 12. there is no scripture that says you receive the holy spirit speaking in tongues or that you receive the holy spirit by speaking in tongues but it does say that after they were all filled with the holy ghost they spake in tongues and later on it says that they prophesied today [Music] you
