and we were over at uh but Max place on Saturday right from here that I was standing there and the whole Saturday I was just constantly on a headache but it went away then I felt a little better I was able to preach through the services on Sunday but then Monday again I just felt so sick but uh the Lord has been our strength amen let's read uh uh Revelation chapter 21. Revelation chapter 21 I just want to take a thought there tonight I just want to look at something praise the Lord foreign I really appreciated the prayer meeting on on Sunday and I just I just wish we didn't had a uh convenience service to go into and then we would just prayed and prayed and prayed on because when it's it's hard to be able to get people into that atmosphere but then when you break into the atmosphere you just don't want to come out of it amen praise the Lord and and the Lord was very very gracious to us Revelation chapter 21 just for the scripture reading let's read from verse 1. and I saw the new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth will pass away and there were no more sea and I saw the holy city knew Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adult for her husband and I heard a great voice Out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God praise the Lord the Tabernacle of God is with men there there's I mean there are thousands of ways that it could spring at us right here but let's just go ahead and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death need a sorrow non-crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he they are sat upon the throne said be whole and make all things new what a day praise the Lord what a day if you want to make plans make plans for days praise the Lord behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these things are truth and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst All The Fountains of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my sons amen praise the Lord but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable and murderers and War muggers and Sorcerers and idolaters in all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brainstorm which is the second death amen let's pray father we want to pray and ask your blessings that you will just uh bless the portion of your word that we have just read a thought is on our heart tonight it's only you that can bring it to your people and make it something of internal value unless you bring it out Lord to be of your internal thoughts it will just be father me speaking to them precious Lord bless your children in their homes that are following the service tonight the once law that couldn't make the service because of work and all the appointment traveling and whatever it is we pray that God you will be with him you will bless them as well we thank you we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord for the will of announcement we will be away this weekend like I said before we have a wedding in uh in DC uh I will sister Malaika she will be getting married to one brother George from Benny Republic young people that we we knew over the years so we'll be going over to support them uh this uh this coming weekend in Burma Wars have asked that we speak for him on Sunday so uh I pray that the Lord will just break us out of this cold feeling praise the Lord and uh and then right after that we trust in the Lord that he will he will be able to to help us yes there is a uh an emergency call that on Saturday I was able to talk to two ministers brother Sunday if you remember during the prayer meeting and we make mention to pray for the church that is having some form of chaos and and have that have broke into violence and uh and and all of that and so these brothers have have uh requested that we step in and help the situation so I call two other brothers and and uh I was trying to encourage them to go one of the brother uh Pastor that church before and so but then if it was almost like I needed to join the train so we will really really need your prayers I mean I'm just I'm just giving it to the Lord I could go or I could not depending on how things happen but have thrown my heart in to be able to help the situation so it's a kind of a Macedonia call here so we just want to pray that the Lord will be able to to help the situation is is a DNA we call we could say a lot about it but there is nothing in there that is edifying there is nothing in it that is edifying so these are the things that Paul Warner should not be mentioned Among Us so there is no need of measuring it so uh that's where we are then and I mean I really I really I try to try to you know be myself out of there I thought it looks like it's hard but I'm just giving it to the Lord if he works it out we will be away next week by God's grace so tonight I want to I want us to just look at a local talk and yeah I send uh just two coats back there let's I will read a quote First on the message and time and uh brother Branham said yeah he said you always talk about how bad the word is and how we can the word is which of course that's all we get from the news that's all we get from from from the from the media we year in about global recession we are hearing about uh uh atomic wall we are hearing you know and that is just all that's just all you hear every time and and even two years uh you know that uh people are supposed to be preparing for uh a Rapture in the body change and now doing something yes so it is just bad news everywhere around us he says that's truth but look how great the church is getting all the time and that's the one that is difficult to see because the body of the church is Mystical praise the Lord amen it's mystical so we don't see the greatness of the church in the number of people we don't see the greatness of the church uh [Music] uh in in her activities if you look at the church just by her appearance you will find that uh [Music] uh you know more people are turned into different things than uh than what uh you know the the early church will go from house to house breaking bread and all of that but the greatness he says but look how great the church is getting all the time we fail to look at that side Jesus said let them grow together in a sense they are just as much as the world will be having chaos God will also be will he will be bringing his tender plane up the church will keep going from Grace to Grace the Lord let them grow together when the words getting weak young and wicked and weaker the church is getting more powerful and Powerful all the time praise the Lord can we say Amen amen it is almost like God telling Gideon thou Mighty Man of villa and he says if the law be for us where are the Miracles and why is all of this befought in us why are people leaving the message and message people are looking for you know some kind of a Vindication you know personal Vindication Church Vindication and looking for new teachings and oh why is all of this befall in US if God be for us if if the Lord who says that the church is getting more powerful then why is all of this befalling us I thought we supposed to be raising the dead and and uh you know and having Mighty Crusades around the world well Graham says when they when the enemy comes like a flawed the spirit of God will raise up a standard against it he say hallelujah let's go Glory the waves are blowing set yourself move right on into the face of the storm what do you care who's their captain he will take care of it now don't fear I'm always there praise the Lord now just like I said brother Branham said Junction of time that that's uh when when whenever we get to any Junction in our life natural spiritually financially family-wise Church whatever Junction it is there is two major things that happen at every Junction praise the Lord you get that's the reason why they put a four-way stop sign at this Junction right out of the church here if net there will always be accident praise the Lord there will be chaos if there was not a four-way stop sign to control the traffic because at every Junction there is always chaos the enemy comes in as a flawed but also at the junction the spirit of God will raise up a standard and that's what the believer have to be looking for right amen when whenever we have any form of chaos around us we have to be looking for like one that like one old man said one old man preacher he said don't never allow the lessons to be wasted whenever you have a situation don't allow the lesson for you to learn to be wasted because every situation brings a lesson to learn so we have to watch for because if you find what the Lord wants you to do then that is the standard that God has raised in the midst of that chaos but now see what brother Branham said he says when the enemy coming uh like a floor the spirit of God will raise up a standard against it Hallelujah let's go Glory he says the wings are blowing set yourself Hallelujah move right on into the face of the storm what do you care who's the captain who's in control amen who's in control he will take care of it now don't fear I'm always there like Jesus said be not afraid it is I amen now so it's it's beautiful that this quote end with this don't fear there is something here in Revelation chapter 21 that I want for us to look at let's go back again to our scripture Revelation chapter 21 we will read verse 7 and 8. he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son praise the Lord but the fearful their own believing and they're abominable and he goes and calls the murderers and the homongers the sorcerers idolaters Liars shall have their part in the lake wishburneth with fire and brimstones which is the second death now we it is it is it's easy for us to think about uh the unbelieving means that unbelievers somebody that do not believe we know that you know the you know murderer I mean the person is already possessed with a demon Sorceress in an evil spirit Witchcraft and and all of that uh it is it is it is so easy for you for them to be related with all of the group here but there is one that uh sometimes we don't think about he says the fearful the fearful how many times in the scripture that God told his people fear that it's over 360 times so you can take one fear now for a day praise the Lord now this will bring me to my second Court here uh those in those blood Brands said in many other places he said this he said God gave the human race his word to fortify themselves from death sin sorrow or any disaster a chain of his word so the word is like a chain that that you know the host like this in holes like this and holes like this you know a chain and he says thou shall not touch this certain tree for the day you eat day after the day you will die and a chain is only its best at its weaker link and our souls are pulled over hell holding to this chain praise the Lord now if you bring it back to Revelation chapter 21 verse 8 the Bible says all of these Elias shall find their path in the lake that burneth with fire so all of these are over like brother Branham say our souls uh uh let me let me see read that again our souls I pull over hell holding to this chain break one of them that's all you have to do that's all you have to do Eve never broke a sentence she broke a word by Satan praise the Lord that was the first of the book and in the middle of the book comes Jesus and said man shall not lay by bread alone but by every word but by every word not part of them just one year and there but every word that proceed out of the mouth of God so what am I going to tonight with this now brother brand name I was I was kind of looking at a picture this morning I tried to uh uh snatch up the picture but I just couldn't do it do it good in a way that I that I wanted to do it and uh at a very good picture and and in a way to picture it is that uh year is year is one man that is going over this burning fire hanging on the Chain now the the chain has to run him from this end to that end and honor him is a burning fire and he's afraid that he's going to fall in the fire what is going to happen to him he's going to fall anyway praise the Lord here is another guy that is on the very same chain going over the the same fire right but this guy is believing on God's promised word are we together I want us to look a few uh scriptures in the Bible in Deuteronomy chapter 20 . you look at verse 8 there are not much of a reading the end I just wanted to look a few things in that life and the officers shall speak follow unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted let him go and return to his house leaves his virgin's heart faint as well as his Joshua chapter 7 verse 3 and therefore go to Proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid let him return and depart early from my galley and their return of the people 20 and 2000 and there remained ten thousand praise the Lord Isaiah chapter 35 verse 4 said to them that I offer fear for heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even with a recompense and he will come and save you now so tonight what I want us to look at as we are looking at their scripture when you look in Revelation chapter 21 that we have just read you'll realize there's a beautiful scene because if you go back and look at chapter 18 and and chapter 19. the great hold has just been dealt with the great uh system that have heard the word bound right from Genesis Babylon so out there in Revelation chapter 18. as a woman that was drawn with the blood of uh of of the Nations Kings and all of that now we see that the system has really been dead with and then you look in Revelation chapter 20 you also see there judgment has come upon her now so over in Revelation chapter 21 now the New Jerusalem is now introduced but as we as we thought on this before John used the New Jerusalem and the bride intertwining he speaks of the Senate and he speaks of the Bride praise the Lord because in one sense the bride represent the city and the city is for the bride praise the Lord the New Jerusalem is for the bride and while we are here on Earth we represent the setting amen now so John used that he says uh you see there over and over he says and I saw the new Heaven and a new Earth as a bride a door for her husband so after that that that their system has been dealt with now the Bible talks about uh the devil being cast you know in in you know into the the Lake of Fire and all of that then Revelation 21 comes and talks also about the New Jerusalem but then the Bible says here now I had a great voice Out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men just like I said thousand different ways we can look at this and one of the ways that is spring out to me is that uh until that system is completely deal with as the word of God said he will deal with it it stays in one Sense on us you have to realize that Babylon runs parallel with everything that God been doing right from Genesis amen God called Our Father Abraham out of Babylon praise the Lord so in another sense is that Babylon will type our fallen nature it's a city of confusion it's a city of deception it's a city that uh uh that uh one time Mira wanted to be a tower that would reach to the throne of God he said it's a city and then we see in the scripture how is it it changes its form and now we realize now we we are dealing with Babylon more in the spiritual sense than like it was in the natural sense praise the Lord so in a religious way we know that that's why Revelation 18 4 come out of Babylon Broadband says that he says that was the message of uh uh the laodisha messenger he says when when the messenger in laudisha is sounding his message it was Revelation 18 4 come out of all my people praise the Lord amen that's the reason why now the Bible has described the destruction of their City the Tabernacle of God can now dwell with men praise the Lord amen I want I want I want to create this picture in in a way that that you will really be able to see it in a sense that uh uh everything that we have to deal with everything that we we you know uh our uh even when you look into what is playing out now in politics let me just bring out something there so you will see brother Branham speaks about three curtains he speaks about the Iron Curtain which is Russia he speaks about the Bible curtain which is China and he also speaks about the pipel curtain which is room now if you look on the international stage you will realize that these three curtains you have to remember that curtains like in the the Old Testament Tabernacle was built with curtains right amen curtains are hanged to create a shade it's saying so we cannot be able to look behind it so curtains is is a sense of uh I'm trying to get the best warrior to use tonight curtains are hanged because uh uh uh either to stop a view okay you you you're having uh uh you know you you put curtains up sometimes so people cannot be able to look behind okay behind the scenes that's that's what burbanks is behind the curtains of time our our flesh here is a curtain okay so I I just get so but then if you look on the international scene you will see that these three curtains are hanging before the word Russia is out there threattening with uh with atomic bomb China is also out there playing on the the economy of the world but brother Branham taught us of this purple curtain which is wrong but when you look out there you will see that you will you you will not actually see the the the the Vatican in the way that you will see the Vatican why because if you come to Revelation chapter 13 you have to realize that America should be speaking in the place of that Beast right so the purple curtain is actually United States is actually playing that role of the purple curtain are we together now so what am I saying as as I'm I'm trying to uh make this picture clear to you tonight is the other when God finally bring his judgment on the Roman system on the B system in all of his deception that will that will you know wrap up everything that we are dealing with finally the Tabernacle of God will be with man praise the Lord amen we have uh the word of God we have the Holy Ghost we have the message of the hour but yet we are still dealing with uh a lot of things I mean a lot of things that are happening in the world the present word condition we are still dealing with a lot of deception a lot of you know false teaching and all of that but all of those things will be wrap up when God will finally bring his judgment on this so finally the Tabernacle of God will be with men and God will dwell with them they shall be his people and God himself will be their God but we realize here the Bible will come down and says he there overcome shall inherit all things the benefit of everything will be given to him and I will be his God he will be my son but the fearful praise the Lord but the fearful like someone said before he says I've always puzzled over you know the thought word God will give us the one thousand year reign word Saturn will be bound for a thousand years we will have the privilege to experience eating like like Adam had amen he says but then right after that right after the thousand years as the Bible will will describe after the world will come from honor such a millennial ring the devil will still be able to deceive people praise the Lord he will say have his subject you will say have people to deceive uh uh you know for for the entire climax of the world to come so think about how much the four has caused mankind yeah after the great price that Jesus Paid on the cross of Calvary like we spoke about on on Sunday and I was I was even thinking about that while driving to church thinking about that Memorial and one scripture that struck my mind is that even when Jesus come back to the Jews he's going to come with a nice house body and they were asking where did you get these wounds praise the Lord even when he comes back to to the Jews he's going to come back with venezcast but he's got he's going to come back with this with that body that is kept as a memorial praise the Lord I was just driving to church this evening in the thought kind of struck my mind that I said oh yeah that's that's beautiful he will even take that body over to the Jews praise the Lord but let's get back to the thought that we we want to deal with tonight so what what uh what I'm kind of for trying to bring to you tonight just for an encouragement is that what are we afraid of praise the Lord amen so you we will realize that there's one sense you know that the four drop in the human spirit that with all that God have done for us and he's continuing to do and all the things that he's showing us and all the promises that he's giving giving to us we stay there with fear there is State their sense of fear in so much that God will have to put the fear for among the whole mongers and the adulators and their Liars they will all find their place in the Lake of Fire praise the Lord in a sense what I'm trying to drive to you tonight church is that a uh uh that that is that is something that uh as a Believer that's that's still on us praise the Lord and you see it all through the scripture you take an example even in the life of of God's Prophet but Brandon that's the reason why he preached the message I was with Moses because God was dealing with him for that what are you afraid of why you always want to wait for the vision when are we when are we going to come to the place where we will have this total confidence that I'm a Child of God I'm a son of God when will we come to that place just like how uh Pride is is it's a sense of the Fallen nature so also fear is embedded in our flesh right now with all everything that God I give my angels but the angels of the Lord I ain't come about thee praise the Lord we believe that the angels are of the Lord is with us with all that God has done all everything that he have shown us yet there is still that nag in fear um that nagging fear praise the Lord stay that night in fear now so take it in the sense now that brother Branham is saying this that our soul are pulled over hell holding to this chain and the chain is God's word praise the Lord tonight that's that's that's where we are tonight like I said one night the only thing we we we we have uh uh as an Evidence sitting in this building tonight is our faith in Jesus Christ it's not the way we feel praise the Lord because if I go by my feeling I don't even want to preach tonight it's not the way we feel is now what we think of ourselves or what we have done or what we hoping to do for the Lord it is our faith in Christ Jesus praise the Lord so you see as our soul is pulled over hell all into holding to this chain and he said the chain is God's word every promise every promise holds to another promise and it locks into another promise and it locks into another promise and that's what we are hauling as we pull our soul over hell praise the Lord then you see then it brings us to the place brothers and sisters word it will it will be it will be uh uh much better or easier for us if we will constantly pulled our Faith or put our trust in this chain that is pulling our soul over hell then to feel on the thoughts of fear that I might not be able to make it or am I mad or you know I'm I'm not doing this right or I'm not living this right you know what what whatever whatever our our situation whatever our breath was whatever our past was yet God in his Mercy reached down and he was able to hook our soul to that chain praise the Lord what benefit we have to put trust in the god that has reached down to pick us up than to be looking at the symptoms around our life and the trouble around our home and our family and different things more than trusting in God's word I was just think about uh uh meditating on this this morning that God will mention the fearful and just like we read in the scripture every time he will say send the fearful back amen he says the man that I send them back those that are afraid and finn-hearted you send them back praise the Lord because no matter what God would do they will stay I mean they will stay be questioning it they will still be looking back and and all of that you know Gideon brought those men down to the river and after he have sent bunch of the men back he told Gideon bring them down to the river and see how they are going to drink the man that bowed their hairs and drunk directly from the water those were the ones that God took the one I took the water into their hands which of course you would think that is a military position because he's trying to watch he's trying to keep God but God looks down and says he's fearful praise the Lord sometimes we put we put seven things in place that looks uh you know very good very decent I mean there's nothing wrong with it but are we putting those things in place because uh you know it's just the right thing to do or is it all because of fear oh is it all because of here praise the Lord oh and over God gave his promise to his people I will send my angels before you and as I thought about that all through uh thinking about the service tonight in my mind I was thinking to just give us the occasion for us to be able to you know just bring ourselves to this place and and uh and look for that area in our life what are you afraid of what is it there that is haunting you where is that place in your life where you have not rise in faith to get a hold of God as a young person are you afraid you're going to make mistake is is it is if is it that fear that is hunting your mind praise the Lord Brother Brandon gave a scenario like this he said if you are on a death Road and you will be killed he says which of course is a fearful thing you naturally you will be afraid right by the prophet of God said if you were if you would have faith in God he says faith in God can change the situation but whether you are afraid on that you are already on death Road and and in the morning you'll be killed so being afraid is not going to help you anyway being a friend is just going to kill you before you be dead right praise the Lord but faith in God until the last moment before your breath leave your body can change the situation praise the Lord oh I hope church you are seeing what I'm seeing tonight or what I'm trying to bring you to tonight what are we afraid of what are we afraid of you realize that people unconsciously are driven by fear and the thing that either they are uh uh take take uh take take for example now because with with all of these things that we have we're beginning to see around us sometimes people are dreaming about fear thinking they are well this is the way that they can be able to protect say for example I'm taking uh an example here a young person thinking that this is a way they can be able to protect their relationship or their friendship with somebody and why there is something contrary to the word but wanting to protect the friendship they allow the word to fail they allow that child to do something wrong or they allow they are afraid to do something wrong or they allow their spouse to be standing in a compromising position just to in their mind they are trying to save their relationship or save their friendship praise the Lord but if the word do not save us in any situation we are never safe we are not saved by how clever we approach the matter all by finding our own way to solve our problem what saved us is the word praise the Lord and we see people has put themselves in in in and you know in in in compromising position just because they think they are well okay you know uh this is a good friend uh this you know this this person and and then sometimes uh you mean even sometimes you find that with church and uh and and preacher in every way what I'm trying to say tonight is that what are we afraid of unless the Lord build the house the man that laboreth he laborers in vain unless the Lord wash over the city praise the Lord I'm I'm trying tonight to be able to go into your uh enter your your your spirit compartment and see what is that thing that is bugging you because as long as we are fearful have a sense of fear you will never be able to express faith in the right way praise the Lord you will never be able to express faith in the right way you believe God it's a Healer amen we believe that God Is A Healer why most of the time sometimes when we are having desperate situation the first thing that people thinks about is is my life right with God before they pray for the sake God did not make his promise to heal the sick based on you if your life is right or not but what makes us get in that gear is because we are fearful we are afraid that we will pray and the sick will not be healed the fear of failure that's what brings us to the place as if we're trying to repent no you're not repenting you are just afraid you are afraid to take God at his word then you put it in a condition as if you are trying to examine your life no you are afraid there's a fear that is haunting you know why sometimes young even young people they struggle to be able to to to testify of you know someone just appreciate them for the good virtue oh you look decent right the struggle why because of fear they don't want to be rejected praise the Lord so is the grace is not there to say oh yeah thank you I'm I'm a Christian this the grace is not there why is all because of fear the fear of rejection are you seeing what I'm going tonight right but you have to think about it tonight that God is considering the fearful just like the idolaters they all have their place in the Lake of Fire that's that's the place I want to bring you tonight for you to see because it has to all be him it has to be Christ we have to fall a trust in him many tries to make a name for themselves they try to build a repetition are talking to one friend of mine you know he called me on the phone and and uh you know and was sharing with me now you know brother you know they you know pray for my boys you know and and all of that and and you know and uh as he was talking to me and I just talked I pick it up immediately I told him I said brother you know what is happening despite your boys are going through there but I realized that you are afraid and what the fear is what would people say about my Ministry what would people say about me I didn't treat my child well so that fear now put the parent in desperation to start looking for ways to to either to make excuses for the child right praise the Lord all they go so high on the child to catch what what is causing that fear is fear that is causing it fear is terrifying them praise the Lord for you to believe that you took this child to The Altar and commit that child in the hands of God and you say Lord I dedicate my child to you praise the Lord and you have the grace to have raised that child and send that child to Sunday school and y'all came to you saw the grace all that that boy he's a wonderful boy he loved the Lord you know he's a good child I'm so proud of him when the wheels turn then the parent grants into shock Johnny you know you know we don't believe this thing in the message what makes us to do that fear and whenever fear takes a hold of a person you can make the worst out of the situation that's why God will say stand still praise the Lord if you don't know what to do stand still see the salvation of the Lord praise the Lord amen I don't know what I'm just preaching to myself tonight because it looks like my top is all in my own head maybe I'm enjoying it more than you praise the Lord because sometimes the preacher we struggle with that we struggle to be able to bring out what actually we have on our hearts to the people I'm just thinking about it that God we put the fear for which of course is almost like God sees fear just like adultery he puts everything it's just like it's just like witchcraft sorceress because here is a person that is believing in the only potent God he he he have seen a God in his life and the grace of God helping him now when he just comes to some simple situation he gets so overtaken by fear overtaking by fear that he even forget that God has ever done any miraculous thing in his life foreign see how sometimes when we have situations family situations and and uh you know a health situation or financial situation we forget about how Godfather people in the in the in the wilderness for 40 years is when we have food then we praise the Lord manner fell from heaven then then that scripture looks so wonderful praise the Lord are you understand what I'm saying tonight I I hope it's I'm just now in my in my element tonight it looks like I'm in my own element tonight but that's what I wanted to bring to you that's what I wanted to bring to you I wanted for us to step back a little bit and ask yourself why am I afraid of what am I afraid of if I say I love I love this woman my wife why should I be afraid to be able for us to talk about what we believe to be the truth I should not be rude about it praise the Lord we know that seed is now planted and the tree grow in the same day we must be able to visit truth we must be able to bring our our life in the light of Truth praise the Lord when Jesus said blessed that is he that is now offended in me when I'm in a when I'm approached on truth what I'm the pastor or not praise the Lord why am I afraid of why should I be afraid that if you come and approach me and say brother warn you you said this thing or this thing is not according to the message why would I ever think in my mind that if I accept you I will be a lesser Pastor to you why should I think like that praise the Lord the only thing that can happen is that if you don't want me I become an evangelist that's all that's all that can happen if you say somewhere brother you are not inspired anymore this thing this thing should be a very simple thing for you to preach and you're preaching something different we don't want you again as a pastor you just put me on the street praise the Lord and just to look for the next place to travel to but why should I think that when I'm corrected with truth it makes me a lesser person that people will struggle and get fear and and it will all take their mind and put us on your body is shaking it's just fear it's just fear why should a child correction to you terrify you why should your wife correcting you why should it terrify you it's just fear is just fear but what I'm trying to bring to you tonight that they're fearful it's just like the liar because what is behind fear a lying spirit well if you ever do it will make you to lose your virtue thank you praise the Lord and sometimes that's the thing that gets in the mind of all of the all of the young people they think that they have to go into sin they have to live a foolish life for them to for them to understand the grace of God who told you that who told you that you have to smoke cigarette or you have to go and live in fornication for you to know the grace of God what makes them to think like that yeah they are afraid praise the Lord do you know that was exactly what Satan used on Eve he made her afraid that there was something that God was hiding from them that if they would break the word of God what God is hiding they will get to know it praise the Lord most of the time when we are reacting out of anger it's fear fear is a terrible demon it's a terrible demon here is a religious demon what are you afraid of what are you afraid of have you ever lied on your bed he said I'm so afraid to sleep I don't know if I close my eyes I'll wake up Lord have suffered to sleep all right I don't know if I should sleep well I don't want to close my eyes I don't know if I will wake up praise the Lord if you ever get to that place we carry you to a home for you to be will take you away from your loved ones because you will terrify everybody but we lie to him we sleep and the Bible says he gave his beloved sleep David said he alone keep us in safety when we are asleep praise the Lord that moment where we are completely upset everything that is around us he watched over us and here he said we wake up in the morning maybe it is the fan blowing or you got a dishwasher on who spelled it [Music] all the time you were sleeping you never thought about Who's down there right fear he's such a terrible demon you were sleeping and cruising in sleep and then you wake up and immediately that sense kicking it's a terrible demon you see how much it it takes us from the Liberty that we must be enjoying but what I wanted to show you tonight is that God count the fearful with the idolaters praise the Lord how people out of fear they will make history decisions it's not really what one they wanted to do but they were just afraid they don't want to be left alone mm-hmm musicians you can come up to now I think I think the Holy Spirit got you to where he want you to be
