[29:21] but I'm trusting God to see us true
[29:24] praise God
[29:31] um
[29:34] whatever you are trusting God for

[29:41] God wants to honor himself in the lives
[29:44] of his children
[29:46] there but accept you give God
[29:50] room
[29:52] you would never see it manifest
[29:58] just make room for God

[30:10] God bless you Sister I've been asking of
[30:12] you
[30:14] good to see you
[30:16] yes
[30:17] make room for God
[30:21] and let God come in and see God work in
[30:24] your life
[30:26] praise be to God
[30:28] there was a part of the story
[30:31] brother Joshua left out last week
[30:35] and um
[30:37] when he was giving his testimony
[30:40] and I just want to pick just that and
[30:42] then we'll move on
[30:46] he went to
[30:48] a hospital
[30:49] asking them to do
[30:52] to evaluate him for the surgical
[30:56] operation
[30:58] and this hospital here
[31:01] I examined him and told him he was not
[31:03] qualified for it
[31:05] because his vision was just too bad
[31:09] so he goes to work
[31:11] and somebody at work tells him
[31:13] about
[31:16] um
[31:19] laser surgery
[31:21] then he started praying about it
[31:25] and then he had a dream
[31:29] if I get it wrong you correct me
[31:32] he had a dream
[31:35] and in a dream was it a man who told you
[31:37] you would see
[31:39] a voice a voice taught him in the dream
[31:43] that you are going to see again
[31:46] are you going to see or you're going to
[31:48] see again
[31:58] I want to say that my left eye came open
[31:59] but for some reason my right eye was
[32:01] still closed and I noticed in the dream
[32:03] it took a little a little bit longer but
[32:06] it had opened and as soon as I did that
[32:08] I woke up and it was right after I had
[32:11] prayed about
[32:12] the next procedure or evaluation I was
[32:15] going to
[32:16] and then praise be to God Amen good
[32:21] so now
[32:22] he leaves this hospital here which says
[32:24] he was not qualified and he goes to this
[32:27] Hospital
[32:28] and they tell him you you qualify
[32:32] and then
[32:34] on the day of the surgery he goes to the
[32:37] hospital that says he's qualified and
[32:39] for some reason they say you know what
[32:41] before we do the surgical oppression you
[32:43] have to go to this hospital here which
[32:45] says you are not qualified
[32:47] and they have to consent to it before we
[32:50] do it
[32:51] it doesn't make sense does it
[32:54] but then he goes
[32:56] and the same people that said you didn't
[32:58] qualify they said oh you qualify
[33:03] praise be to God
[33:05] then these people had to do the surgery
[33:07] what I'm trying to bring us to
[33:10] is that never underestimate what prayer
[33:13] can do
[33:15] that's right never never never
[33:18] underestimate what your prayer can do
[33:22] it's okay to ask for prayers
[33:25] it's okay
[33:27] because the Bible makes us to understand
[33:29] one which is a thousand and two will
[33:31] chase ten thousand I thought I was good
[33:34] at math until I saw this
[33:38] praise be to God
[33:40] two would
[33:45] bet if for any reason
[33:49] you have to fight it out and sort it out
[33:51] on your own
[33:53] do not let your faith waver
[33:56] praise be to God
[33:58] when you go on your knees it doesn't
[34:00] matter what is on your knees it doesn't
[34:03] matter whether what you're on your back
[34:04] it doesn't matter whether you are behind
[34:07] the steering wheel
[34:08] just let it be you guys remember of the
[34:11] story I told you when I was behind my
[34:13] truck and that thing was coming again
[34:16] yes I didn't have to go on my knees
[34:18] behind the steering wheel I just sat
[34:20] down
[34:21] it was not even I wouldn't I just said
[34:24] oh Father do not father have mercy I
[34:27] mean don't just I need your help please
[34:30] father just don't let this I just I just
[34:33] spoke
[34:34] I wouldn't call that a prayer
[34:38] and
[34:40] it was it was just over
[34:43] praise be to God
[34:46] so I'm just using it to set the tone
[34:50] tonight we are going to look at
[34:52] something
[34:54] I have not forgotten that we've not read
[34:56] our scripture yet I have not started
[34:59] but I'm very mindful of our time tonight
[35:02] I don't know how much time I'm gonna I'm
[35:05] gonna get
[35:07] um it's nothing much
[35:08] it's just a I mean um
[35:12] just a little lesson here I want us to
[35:15] look at
[35:16] which I have titled
[35:18] getting away with everything
[35:21] getting away with everything
[35:25] and at work probably three months or a
[35:28] little under three months
[35:32] I changed my department I used to be in
[35:34] Syria I have moved to baking stroke
[35:39] meals stroke pets
[35:41] and
[35:43] we froze some items actually it was meat
[35:46] that was ground and we froze it
[35:49] and we were splitting it
[35:52] and I had a butcher's knife
[35:55] very big and long
[35:57] and I was using it to split
[36:00] the the meat
[36:01] and it was icy
[36:04] so it slipped
[36:06] and one is slipped
[36:09] in fact it's just been a miracle
[36:13] when it slipped the easiest place
[36:17] the knife was supposed to go was right
[36:20] here
[36:22] because I had his hand on it
[36:24] and the knife went this way
[36:27] and when it went I've had knife cuts and
[36:31] machete Cuts plenty times
[36:33] okay you will feel the instrument going
[36:36] through you and you throw the knife away
[36:38] but this time
[36:42] I finished cutting myself before I
[36:45] realized I had done it
[36:47] that was how fast
[36:49] it was
[36:51] so if the knife had come anywhere here
[36:54] I would have cut through
[36:56] before even realizing it
[36:59] and I took these two fingers
[37:03] script
[37:04] went into the nails
[37:07] and actually if you looked at it it was
[37:09] like a piece of my finger was gone
[37:12] it was so vivid that when the First
[37:15] Responders came they tried to stop the
[37:17] blood it wouldn't stop
[37:18] and the surgeon have lost the finger I
[37:20] said nope
[37:22] so they went there to look for it that
[37:24] was how bad it was
[37:26] and it was a test day
[37:28] the following day I wasn't supposed to
[37:30] go to work I had taken it off so I
[37:32] didn't go to work so the Monday I went
[37:36] to work and the people were surprised I
[37:38] came to work
[37:40] I'm fine
[37:43] except we heard about you I said yes
[37:45] this is it he said no this was not what
[37:47] we had
[37:51] I said but this was what happened
[37:53] they said you cut your cut yourself I
[37:54] said yes this is it
[37:58] and honestly I didn't think the
[38:00] fingernails were going to grow back
[38:02] might have grown back
[38:04] so the same week
[38:07] I was sitting down
[38:09] and one of the First Responders he is
[38:12] um the the the shift lead for the first
[38:16] shift and then he was sitting with his
[38:19] colleagues and I was sitting down doing
[38:21] something on the computer
[38:23] what happened to you last week I said I
[38:25] cut my fingers
[38:27] and the other guy said yeah it was
[38:29] really really bad
[38:31] and he has the biggest stitches I said
[38:33] no
[38:35] and the first responder who came and saw
[38:37] what happened
[38:39] and was not looking at my fingers healed
[38:41] just in less than one week and he says
[38:44] something he said if you have God in
[38:48] your life
[38:49] the way Donnelly does you can literally
[38:52] get away with anything
[38:54] on that
[38:55] [Applause]
[38:57] praise be to God
[39:00] and I sat down
[39:03] and the whole place was quiet
[39:05] and from there on the conversation
[39:07] changed
[39:08] praise be to God
[39:11] that you can get away with anything
[39:15] and I'm here to tell us
[39:17] that you can get away with everything
[39:20] yeah not with anything but with
[39:23] everything
[39:24] praise be to God and it's funny
[39:27] yesterday I was just sitting behind my
[39:29] computer getting ready for this
[39:31] it was it's been a busy week I have just
[39:33] been going left and right I was just
[39:35] sitting in the process of his friend
[39:36] that that they don't call me here very
[39:39] soon they found my way they were calling
[39:41] me
[39:42] I never had time to look at anything we
[39:44] are just trusting God anyway
[39:46] and another person comes he was trying
[39:48] to discredit somebody on the job I said
[39:52] no it is not true
[39:55] and he said you sit down behind your
[39:58] computer all day writing sermons
[40:01] and they come here and they look at here
[40:04] they don't say anything
[40:05] and you got away with it and because of
[40:07] that you think you are telling lies
[40:10] and he again says I'm getting away
[40:13] with something
[40:18] so I started wondering it looks like I'm
[40:20] getting away with too many things
[40:24] praise God it's interesting
[40:27] shall we stand for the reading of the
[40:29] word
[40:30] shall we turn our Bibles to Romans 8.
[40:37] thank you
[40:53] Romans 8
[40:55] I'm reading from 23.
[40:59] ah sorry sorry let's take Romans 6 first
[41:03] Romans 6 23.
[41:10] Romans 6 23 and I read
[41:15] for the wages of sin is death
[41:17] by the gift of God is eternal life
[41:20] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[41:23] amen
[41:24] praise be to God now let's go to eight
[41:27] one
[41:31] eight one
[41:34] that is therefore now no condemnation
[41:39] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[41:43] work not after the flesh
[41:46] but after the spirit
[41:50] may the Lord
[41:52] add His blessings to the religion of his
[41:54] word in Jesus name
[41:56] amen
[41:57] shall we be seated
[42:04] as I said this is a little teaching
[42:07] and I'm just trusting God
[42:10] to minister to us
[42:14] getting away
[42:15] with everything
[42:19] the first scripture we read
[42:22] is saying
[42:25] that the wages of sin is death
[42:30] now we all know what wages are
[42:36] if you are working
[42:37] you earn wages
[42:41] it's something you work for
[42:44] you put Time and Labor into it
[42:47] and then you are rewarded
[42:51] so sin
[42:53] will put time and effort into it
[42:58] and the reward you get
[43:02] is there
[43:05] the wedges of sin
[43:08] is death
[43:10] now
[43:12] let us look at death
[43:24] we all know what death is
[43:28] and I believe that when the Bible says
[43:31] the wages of sin is death
[43:33] and it's not the type of death we know
[43:40] it is not the physical death
[43:43] because it's appointed unto man wants to
[43:47] die
[43:49] says that everything that has a
[43:51] beginning has an end
[43:57] so it doesn't matter
[44:00] whether it's a sinner
[44:03] or a righteous person
[44:06] what I say just all the unjust
[44:11] we all come to the end of that road
[44:16] and we can look behind us and we can
[44:19] tell of our loved ones
[44:22] that have lived for God in all honesty
[44:28] they have done their work they are
[44:30] finished with their Duty and God has
[44:33] called them home
[44:36] if that is the death
[44:38] the Bible is talking about
[44:41] then where does The Sinner come in
[44:46] praise be to God
[44:49] so it is not
[44:53] Jesus one time told his disciples
[44:58] that our friend Lazarus
[45:00] is asleep let's go that we will wake him
[45:03] up
[45:04] but they didn't understand that language
[45:09] and when he realized that they did not
[45:13] understand that language then he spoke
[45:15] in a language they understood
[45:17] and he said he is dead
[45:22] he is dead
[45:29] praise be to God
[45:33] the Bible says
[45:35] in Psalm 116 Psalm 116 verse 15.
[45:41] you can note it down
[45:43] the Bible says that precious
[45:46] in the sight of the Lord
[45:49] is the death of his sins
[45:53] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[45:56] death of his sins
[45:59] we are not talking about Sinners here
[46:04] but do not forget the Bible says the
[46:07] wages of sin is death so what type of
[46:09] sin are we talking about here we will
[46:11] get there in a minute
[46:16] for a Believer or a child of God
[46:21] There Is No Death for a child of God
[46:27] we just
[46:28] fall asleep
[46:32] because
[46:33] it's like going to bed at night you fall
[46:36] asleep
[46:38] guess what because there is a morning
[46:40] coming when you are going to wake up
[46:44] so for a child of God
[46:48] There Is No Death
[46:51] in our vocabulary
[46:54] we just fall asleep
[46:57] and we can visit a few places
[47:01] because when Saul went to the witch of
[47:04] endo
[47:06] and asked him asked her to call
[47:10] Samuel
[47:11] when someone came back
[47:13] someone said why have that disquieted me
[47:19] he was
[47:21] having rest
[47:26] when a man stays on Earth are over
[47:32] when the purpose of which God has
[47:34] brought you into this life is over
[47:37] when you have accomplished the task
[47:41] God just takes you home
[47:45] to just go and rest
[47:49] from all the labor from all the
[47:52] headaches from all the disappointments
[47:54] from all the struggles from all the
[47:56] trials the persecutions God just takes
[47:59] you home to go and rest
[48:02] now
[48:04] whichever way you look at death
[48:09] brother Randolph said that means
[48:11] separation
[48:14] separation
[48:16] whether it is physical death or
[48:18] spiritual death
[48:20] it causes what separation
[48:23] when we take physical death
[48:27] when somebody physically crosses over
[48:31] to the other side
[48:34] that person is separated from the rest
[48:38] of humanity
[48:42] and we should get to the spiritual
[48:44] aspect in a few minutes
[48:47] praise be to God
[48:50] now
[48:56] so
[48:58] someone said why have that disquieted me
[49:01] and now you realize there was a question
[49:04] that was once asked I believe it was
[49:05] Joshua asked me that question and um I I
[49:08] I answered him and later came back again
[49:12] um because I realized there were things
[49:13] I left out
[49:15] now
[49:19] we know that when a man dies
[49:23] that is the end of it
[49:27] and how come the witch of endo was able
[49:32] to call back
[49:34] some more
[49:36] not just any person
[49:39] but a prophet of God that a witch was
[49:42] able
[49:44] to call him
[49:47] said
[49:50] that the Old Testament sins
[49:53] under the blood of bulls and goats even
[49:56] though they died Justified they died
[49:59] believing
[50:01] they were the sons and daughters of God
[50:04] believers
[50:05] people that walked before God and
[50:08] demonstrated the power of God in every
[50:11] way possible
[50:13] they could still
[50:15] not get to the presence of God
[50:19] there was a holding area
[50:22] A Place Called Paradise
[50:25] where these Souls went to
[50:27] awaiting the perfect sacrifice
[50:32] said
[50:34] in that Realm
[50:36] it was easy under the blood of bulls and
[50:39] goats
[50:41] for their spirits to be called back
[50:45] but when the Lord Jesus Christ died the
[50:48] Bible says he took captivity captive he
[50:51] emptied Paradise
[50:53] and under the blood of the Lord Jesus
[50:56] Christ there is no power right
[50:59] that can go in there and bring out the
[51:02] soul and then nothing the spirit of a
[51:04] man or a woman right
[51:06] nothing
[51:10] it is just not possible and you hear
[51:13] people that go into Superior spiritism
[51:17] um I know I have been a Catholic before
[51:19] and they talk about the six or seven
[51:21] books of what and what and what I don't
[51:22] know why we got we ever got that from
[51:24] and they use that to call spirits and
[51:29] they will tell you oh
[51:30] um we just call the spirit of Peter
[51:34] a demon showed up
[51:37] a demon showed up but not Peter
[51:42] and Brad says some way
[51:45] that if a man dies and they are able to
[51:47] call that person's Spirit back it means
[51:51] that that Soul was not saved
[51:57] that means that Soul was not safe
[52:03] it could also happen
[52:06] as I just mentioned about Peter
[52:12] that we know where Peter is
[52:16] no evil spirit can call him back
[52:19] but whenever they go and they are
[52:21] burning their candles and they are
[52:23] chanting
[52:24] something shows up
[52:26] and they say that it's Peter it could
[52:28] also happen that a child of God will
[52:31] depart this Earth
[52:34] and they will call that person's spirit
[52:36] and something will show up
[52:39] and not that person it's possible
[52:44] but if that person shows up that means
[52:47] that's so
[52:48] was not saved
[52:51] praise be to God
[52:53] as I said it's a teaching a little
[52:56] teaching
[52:57] and I've titled it getting away with
[53:01] everything
[53:02] praise be to God
[53:10] now
[53:13] physical death
[53:16] it's just something
[53:18] that if Christ carries
[53:21] all of us will go in the way of the
[53:23] flesh
[53:31] but there is another aspect
[53:34] which is spiritual death
[53:39] and that is a dangerous one
[53:43] there is nothing good about this
[53:48] a man can be living
[53:52] and yet
[53:53] spiritually that man is dead
[53:58] spiritual death is when you
[54:08] when you now the Bible says that there
[54:11] is hope for the living
[54:15] there is hope for the living
[54:18] you can be separated from God
[54:21] but if you are alive
[54:24] there is hope for you
[54:26] what causes the suppression is sin
[54:32] so so long as you are alive
[54:37] even though you are separated from God
[54:40] by sin
[54:42] but there is hope for you
[54:45] why
[54:47] because that blood that was shed is
[54:50] still speaking
[54:54] is when
[54:56] you come to the end of your road and you
[54:59] don't repent and you die in your sin
[55:03] then you are eternally separated from
[55:05] God
[55:07] brother Bradham said
[55:09] that the way a tree leaves that is why
[55:12] it falls
[55:14] so if you live in sin and you end it you
[55:17] end up dying in sin
[55:20] don't expect
[55:22] that some miracle can just happen
[55:26] no it doesn't work that way
[55:29] that's why the Bible says that
[55:34] work out your salvation
[55:37] with fear
[55:44] don't take things for granted
[55:48] we are living in an era
[55:52] where sin has so much been trumpeted
[55:56] so it doesn't look sinful anymore
[56:01] and people think it's okay
[56:05] every day
[56:07] every day examine yourself
[56:11] every single day examine yourself
[56:16] if there is any area in your life you
[56:19] have to plead the blood keep leading the
[56:21] blood
[56:23] right do not let the sun
[56:27] set on it
[56:29] and when you go before God don't speak
[56:33] grammar
[56:34] he sees you the way you are in the
[56:37] inside what is there to hide
[56:43] you go to the hospital because you are
[56:45] sick
[56:48] anything they tell you to do you do it
[56:50] because you want to get well
[56:56] and sometimes it's like they are
[56:57] invading your privacy
[57:00] but you are sick
[57:04] they need to get to the root cause of it
[57:07] and why do you go before God
[57:12] and you want to sugarcoat things
[57:17] just go to him the Way You Are
[57:19] your heart's opened
[57:22] praise be to God
[57:24] praise be to God
[57:29] so there is another day if you come your
[57:31] life yet you are dead
[57:42] and sin
[57:43] is such a dangerous thing
[57:47] never underestimate
[57:51] sin and what sin can do in a man's life
[57:57] God does not associate himself with sin
[58:02] he loves sinners
[58:05] but he hates sin
[58:09] so if there is sin in your life you
[58:12] think God hates you it's because he has
[58:15] nothing that is in you it's not you
[58:19] and if God is going to condemn sin and
[58:22] sin is in you that means God has to
[58:24] condemn you
[58:28] God hates the very sight
[58:32] of sin the verse appear the very sight
[58:35] of evil
[58:36] right can you imagine the Lord Jesus
[58:39] Christ
[58:40] on the cross
[58:44] he never committed anything
[58:48] but he became sin
[58:51] on the cross
[58:53] bearing our sins
[58:56] and he created
[59:01] my God my God why have that forsaken me
[59:04] why because at that moment
[59:08] he was just hanging there as Sin now God
[59:13] did not even want to associate with it
[59:16] that is how dangerous
[59:19] sin can be
[59:24] praise be to God
[59:27] if there is sin in your life
[59:29] you better destroy it or it will destroy
[59:33] you
[59:37] shut up
[59:42] don't keep fighting that demon
[59:48] we are home
[59:51] for the Holy Spirit
[59:55] If Heaven for evil spirits
[59:59] as a matter of fact they shouldn't even
[1:00:01] feel comfortable coming around you
[1:00:05] let alone live in you
[1:00:10] there is so much power in the word of
[1:00:12] God
[1:00:13] to transform in a life
[1:00:17] praise be to God
[1:00:20] in the garden
[1:00:23] God told Adam and if
[1:00:27] the day you eat of this free
[1:00:29] you will surely die
[1:00:32] now we all know the story
[1:00:34] how they add the fruit and indeed
[1:00:37] they surely died
[1:00:40] I know we have looked at a physical side
[1:00:43] a lot
[1:00:46] a day unto God is thousand years to man
[1:00:51] and no man has ever lived above Thousand
[1:00:55] Years
[1:00:56] so yes the very day the age of that food
[1:00:58] that very day they died in the sight of
[1:01:00] God
[1:01:02] but there is a spiritual side I want us
[1:01:05] to also look at
[1:01:09] because sin causes separation
[1:01:14] the wages of sin is death
[1:01:17] sin causes suppression
[1:01:20] that for God to reconcile with man
[1:01:24] and innocent lamb had to die
[1:01:29] so God would have Fellowship
[1:01:33] with man
[1:01:37] and we can look
[1:01:39] at Old Testament Church that that was
[1:01:42] the order that was established
[1:01:46] that men go out of the will of God
[1:01:49] and then they have to come with an
[1:01:50] animal
[1:01:51] confess their sins on the animal
[1:01:54] the animal doesn't have to have any
[1:01:55] blemish the animal dies in their place
[1:01:58] so they would live
[1:02:01] so they will have that relationship
[1:02:04] with God but that was not perfect
[1:02:07] because it was the blood of bulls and
[1:02:10] goats
[1:02:13] it forgave them their sins
[1:02:15] but that desire was still there
[1:02:18] that they went right back
[1:02:20] to it
[1:02:23] that's right praise the Lord
[1:02:26] getting away
[1:02:28] with everything
[1:02:32] a lot of the times
[1:02:36] now
[1:02:39] a lot of the times
[1:02:41] we put
[1:02:43] the horse I mean the cat before the
[1:02:46] horse
[1:02:49] David said
[1:02:51] and iniquity
[1:02:54] am I shaping
[1:02:56] and his sin
[1:02:58] did my mother conceive me
[1:03:01] so your very conception
[1:03:04] was out of the perfect will of God
[1:03:10] your very conception
[1:03:12] before you were ever born
[1:03:15] you were a sinner to begin with
[1:03:19] you didn't have to commit any evil to
[1:03:23] become a sinner
[1:03:25] you were born a sinner
[1:03:28] the reason why people do the things they
[1:03:30] do
[1:03:31] they cheat they lie they fight they
[1:03:34] commit adultery commit fornication they
[1:03:36] steal they kill is because
[1:03:39] of sin
[1:03:44] now
[1:03:45] a lot of the times
[1:03:47] we look at it the other way around
[1:03:52] we said because this guy murdered
[1:03:54] he's a sinner
[1:03:56] oh
[1:03:58] it is because he's a sinner
[1:04:01] that's why he made it
[1:04:07] this person is not even right
[1:04:10] so he's a sinner
[1:04:12] no
[1:04:13] is because a person is a sinner that is
[1:04:17] why they are not living right
[1:04:22] yeah and brother says that sin is
[1:04:24] unbelief
[1:04:29] so if somebody has not believed
[1:04:34] they will do anything
[1:04:37] they will do anything
[1:04:43] and
[1:04:44] you know
[1:04:50] I can't say this enough
[1:04:55] it's a good thing
[1:04:57] reading your Bible
[1:05:01] remember
[1:05:03] that the devil still knows the scripture
[1:05:06] it's a good thing coming to church
[1:05:09] praise be to God
[1:05:12] but before you ever show up the devil is
[1:05:14] already here
[1:05:16] he has never missed
[1:05:19] a church service
[1:05:30] you have
[1:05:32] to enter into the inner courts
[1:05:35] of God
[1:05:38] and have a true relationship
[1:05:41] with God
[1:05:44] that is what differentiates you
[1:05:48] from just being a religious person
[1:05:58] I have something just for being around
[1:06:00] my mind what is that praise be to God
[1:06:05] the letter caliph
[1:06:07] by the spirit Giver of Life
[1:06:12] don't be satisfied with your religion
[1:06:16] never stop at a religion
[1:06:19] brother Brown says Cain was religious
[1:06:25] religion
[1:06:27] is man-made
[1:06:30] it's not what God has done
[1:06:34] it's what you have done right yeah and
[1:06:37] what you can do
[1:06:42] God is not your religion
[1:06:48] praise be to God
[1:06:51] the letter caliph
[1:06:54] by the spirit giveth life
[1:06:58] get into the spirit
[1:07:02] fist with God
[1:07:05] have a true relationship with God
[1:07:07] now when you take the Bible you can feel
[1:07:10] something going on
[1:07:12] you don't read the word of God that
[1:07:13] you're reading newspaper you sit down
[1:07:16] you feed on the word man shall not live
[1:07:19] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:07:21] proceedeth out of the mouth of God you
[1:07:24] are feeding on the word of God
[1:07:27] and you know
[1:07:29] you can just get so hooked up
[1:07:33] just one scripture
[1:07:36] and you never get over it
[1:07:39] that is why there is a true relationship
[1:07:44] there is a communion going on between
[1:07:47] you and God
[1:07:50] praise be to God
[1:07:53] we need to get there
[1:07:56] don't accept anything less
[1:08:02] you are responsible
[1:08:04] for what you do with the word of God
[1:08:08] you are not responsible
[1:08:10] for what someone else's someone else
[1:08:13] does
[1:08:15] is just you
[1:08:20] do we have to pray for one another yes
[1:08:23] do we have to intercede for one another
[1:08:25] yes
[1:08:28] everything that affects you affects me
[1:08:30] anything that affects me affects you
[1:08:35] we are a body of Christ
[1:08:39] but remember
[1:08:42] that it boils down to you
[1:08:45] and to you and God Alone
[1:08:47] praise be to God
[1:08:51] so dear a lot of the times we turn the
[1:08:53] table the other way around
[1:08:55] so
[1:09:01] if men
[1:09:03] had to commit evil
[1:09:05] to become a sinner
[1:09:08] the Bible wouldn't say
[1:09:10] that in sin
[1:09:12] did my mother conceive me
[1:09:15] you were already one
[1:09:18] before you came
[1:09:22] so everything you were doing
[1:09:25] until Christ got a hold of you you are
[1:09:29] doing it because that was the nature
[1:09:33] of the the Fallen soul
[1:09:37] you couldn't help it
[1:09:39] and no man and it's sometimes funny you
[1:09:43] talk to people and they will tell you I
[1:09:45] have this going on I have that going on
[1:09:47] I have to stop before I come who told
[1:09:49] you you could stop
[1:09:51] if you can stop before coming they don't
[1:09:54] even come at all right
[1:09:58] if you can do it on your own it
[1:10:03] that people say God helps us who help
[1:10:05] themselves who told you that
[1:10:07] if you can help yourself you don't need
[1:10:09] the help of God
[1:10:11] God helps those who cannot help
[1:10:13] themselves
[1:10:17] that you come to a place you know you
[1:10:19] are needy
[1:10:21] praise be to God you know you can't help
[1:10:23] this situation
[1:10:26] you just leave it to God
[1:10:29] you let God take over
[1:10:31] and see God work
[1:10:35] my mind was just going round and round
[1:10:37] and round was it Monday I believe it was
[1:10:41] not yesterday so that was Monday
[1:10:45] and I was just thinking of what God has
[1:10:47] done for Joshua
[1:10:51] and I I said
[1:10:53] it just came and I said
[1:10:55] so all the bad buttons is what was doing
[1:10:57] he was not seeing
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:07] and then I thought just came to me
[1:11:10] so if you are seeing
[1:11:12] they're driving worse
[1:11:21] wait thank God for his grace
[1:11:24] I thank God for his grace
[1:11:27] that he can come and leave songs tonight
[1:11:30] praise be to God
[1:11:33] her brother brother brother lawyer
[1:11:38] you guys will wait tell the staff of my
[1:11:40] lawyer to come and they'll jump through
[1:11:42] the window and they are gone
[1:11:49] praise be to God
[1:11:50] it comes to that point in a man's life
[1:11:52] when God has taken a hold of that Soul
[1:11:55] there is nothing you can do anymore
[1:11:58] you just have to sail with God
[1:12:02] just have to step in
[1:12:04] as small as me as much as God gives you
[1:12:07] Grace and just go with the flow
[1:12:11] it's amazing what God can do with the
[1:12:14] life of man
[1:12:16] if you can only submit yourself submit
[1:12:19] your will
[1:12:21] just turn the steering wheel over to God
[1:12:23] and be a passenger
[1:12:26] can you imagine
[1:12:28] you are traveling a road you have never
[1:12:29] traveled on before
[1:12:31] and God is sitting in the passenger seat
[1:12:33] you want to be The Driver
[1:12:38] praise be to God
[1:12:40] yeah so
[1:12:42] it's one of those things
[1:12:44] yeah
[1:12:56] now
[1:13:02] our evil ways
[1:13:05] did not make us sinners
[1:13:10] and for that matter
[1:13:12] our good works
[1:13:15] would never make us righteous
[1:13:19] if it took works
[1:13:23] to become a sinner
[1:13:25] it will take weeks
[1:13:27] to become righteous
[1:13:31] but we became sinners
[1:13:33] by representation
[1:13:36] and our righteousness
[1:13:39] would have to be by representation
[1:13:43] whether you do good or evil it's an
[1:13:47] indication
[1:13:49] of the condition of your soul
[1:13:53] praise be to God
[1:13:57] what am I bringing us through
[1:14:03] the Bible says good works
[1:14:06] are as filthy rights
[1:14:08] in the sight of God
[1:14:13] it will not carry you any voice
[1:14:18] have that in mind as we go on
[1:14:21] faith without works is dead
[1:14:29] good words
[1:14:32] are good
[1:14:34] but without faith they are useless
[1:14:39] our faith is by faith
[1:14:42] our righteousness is by faith in Christ
[1:14:45] Jesus
[1:14:47] in some way a lot of in a lot a lot of
[1:14:50] places where brother said show me your
[1:14:53] faith without your works
[1:14:55] and I will show you my faith
[1:14:57] by my works
[1:15:00] praise be to God
[1:15:03] so
[1:15:09] wax
[1:15:10] have their place
[1:15:13] you can't say you have faith
[1:15:16] when there are no words back in it
[1:15:20] but works
[1:15:22] do not profit on their own
[1:15:25] right now
[1:15:29] God sees faith
[1:15:31] but no man
[1:15:33] sees faith
[1:15:35] when there is Faith in here
[1:15:37] God looks down there and he knows that
[1:15:40] his faith
[1:15:42] but I can't see you a brother or a
[1:15:45] sister and I tell all that is straight
[1:15:47] in here I don't know that
[1:15:50] but by your works
[1:15:53] I can tell whether there is Faith here
[1:15:55] or not
[1:16:00] so the effect you have is going to
[1:16:03] produce
[1:16:05] a life
[1:16:07] that is why the Bible says by their
[1:16:09] works
[1:16:10] you shall know them
[1:16:15] telling you the condition
[1:16:18] of the soul of the person
[1:16:21] by their works
[1:16:24] we shall know them
[1:16:28] so faith
[1:16:30] it's a good thing
[1:16:33] but it must produce life
[1:16:36] there is no way you can justify it
[1:16:41] when the life that the life that is
[1:16:43] supposed to accompany it
[1:16:46] is absent
[1:16:56] getting away with everything
[1:17:00] talks about you look at a baby or maybe
[1:17:03] a little child or children and you see
[1:17:06] how innocent they are
[1:17:10] and sometimes oh
[1:17:12] you love to have been in that condition
[1:17:14] because they are innocent
[1:17:23] that a man that is born of God
[1:17:27] when you are cleansed by the blood
[1:17:30] the brother was said for you and I when
[1:17:33] you are cleansed by that blood you are
[1:17:36] more innocent
[1:17:38] than the baby
[1:17:42] when I first heard this
[1:17:45] my antennas just
[1:17:48] came up I said what
[1:17:50] I never thought of it that way
[1:17:54] that when you are Washed by the blood of
[1:17:56] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:59] you are not as innocent as the baby no
[1:18:02] you are more innocent
[1:18:06] um
[1:18:07] my innocent
[1:18:12] that is how powerful
[1:18:15] the blood of our Redemption is
[1:18:20] getting away
[1:18:23] with everything
[1:18:26] getting away
[1:18:28] with everything I have Mary Magdalene
[1:18:31] here
[1:18:32] I want to skip that
[1:18:35] um I would also
[1:18:37] yes
[1:18:44] so
[1:18:45] you just have to
[1:18:50] he died for us
[1:18:53] but you have to accept the pardon
[1:18:59] we can talk about that man
[1:19:03] who was going to be hanged I mean The
[1:19:05] Gallows
[1:19:07] um he was given a partner he refused it
[1:19:11] um we can skip that
[1:19:13] but you have to accept the pattern for
[1:19:16] it to be effective
[1:19:18] if you don't accept it
[1:19:21] it doesn't mean anything to you
[1:19:25] for it to mean something to you
[1:19:27] you have to accept the pardon
[1:19:31] now
[1:19:32] once I was looking at it something came
[1:19:34] to me
[1:19:36] about a dream
[1:19:39] that Daniel Curry
[1:19:40] had
[1:19:42] that great evangelists
[1:19:45] who won a lot of souls to God
[1:19:50] and in his wordless imagination
[1:19:54] he probably thought everything was right
[1:19:56] with him
[1:19:57] like we sometimes do
[1:20:00] either out of arrogance
[1:20:03] or maybe out of ignorance
[1:20:07] ah something things just sometimes sleep
[1:20:11] under the carpet
[1:20:14] and it's not always all right
[1:20:17] and that in the dream he saw that he
[1:20:19] came before The Throne of God
[1:20:22] and he touched by the time he was going
[1:20:24] to get to the gates the gates were going
[1:20:26] to open wide open and he was just
[1:20:28] walking and they will heal him that was
[1:20:30] not how the story went
[1:20:32] he got there
[1:20:34] so who are you so I'm that great
[1:20:36] evangelist
[1:20:38] um what's your name you don't know me
[1:20:41] I'm Daniel Curry who won a lot of souls
[1:20:43] Christ
[1:20:44] sister we've never had a few we don't
[1:20:48] know you but I think let's open the book
[1:20:49] and check
[1:20:51] so I can't see your name they say no I
[1:20:54] ought to be there check it again
[1:20:56] no I didn't find your name sir
[1:20:59] say you know what
[1:21:01] just go and appeal for your peace
[1:21:04] and when he appeared Before the Throne
[1:21:07] of God
[1:21:09] the slightest things the smallest things
[1:21:12] the days he never regarded
[1:21:16] where the very things that just got
[1:21:19] before him
[1:21:21] and he saw that no
[1:21:26] and when God started asking him
[1:21:28] questions
[1:21:30] he was as guilty as hell
[1:21:34] all he could do was plead the blood
[1:21:39] all he could do was plead the blood
[1:21:43] he saw that he was just good for nothing
[1:21:46] but for hell
[1:21:48] all he could do yes Father it is true I
[1:21:51] told a lie here I did I plead the blood
[1:21:56] and then he had that voice
[1:21:59] that sweet voice
[1:22:01] The Voice we keep hearing every single
[1:22:04] day
[1:22:07] trying to direct our paths
[1:22:10] and we turn it down here and there he
[1:22:12] hears The Voice
[1:22:14] father he stood for me
[1:22:16] while he was on f i stand for him
[1:22:19] praise be to God
[1:22:22] all the sins
[1:22:25] other iniquities
[1:22:29] that were in his way
[1:22:31] had to give way
[1:22:33] because Christ
[1:22:35] had stood in for him
[1:22:39] never classify sin
[1:22:44] sometimes we classify sin
[1:22:50] we look at the beginning is
[1:22:53] and we are quick to repent of them
[1:22:57] but we look at certain things oh this is
[1:22:59] just too small
[1:23:00] oh this is nothing oh this doesn't mean
[1:23:03] anything it means something
[1:23:07] the way the big things appear before God
[1:23:10] that is the same way the smartest appear
[1:23:12] before him
[1:23:14] and the sight of God Sin is Sin there is
[1:23:18] no big sin and there is no small sin
[1:23:23] I have told you guys how I love famine
[1:23:26] and back home we used to use machetes
[1:23:30] hoes and hosts a lot
[1:23:33] and sometimes you are waiting with a
[1:23:36] machete
[1:23:37] and the big trees that are in your way
[1:23:39] you cut them down
[1:23:41] because you are not out of your mouth
[1:23:43] you just walk into it no you will cut it
[1:23:45] down as you're going through
[1:23:47] and sometimes you see a small stick that
[1:23:52] is just hanging a brush
[1:23:55] small very tiny
[1:23:57] that is just hanging
[1:23:59] I know you get so close to it
[1:24:01] you just put it aside instead of cutting
[1:24:04] it down you aside and then you are
[1:24:06] waiting and then you forget of yourself
[1:24:07] you come back there guess what
[1:24:10] it ends up poking your eyes
[1:24:16] they're very smart is you overlook
[1:24:21] you're underestimate the danger they can
[1:24:24] do
[1:24:26] they are the very things
[1:24:28] that would end up being a stumbling
[1:24:30] block in your way
[1:24:35] maybe Daniel Curry
[1:24:38] he may have seen those things
[1:24:41] but so this is just too small what does
[1:24:43] this mean
[1:24:45] and we are you not we we we we do that
[1:24:50] now we're classify sin
[1:24:57] is sin
[1:24:59] and sin
[1:25:01] ought to be treated
[1:25:04] like sin
[1:25:06] sir
[1:25:07] never take things for granted
[1:25:11] in the last few days I have used that
[1:25:13] word
[1:25:14] countless number of times
[1:25:17] never take things for granted
[1:25:20] praise be to God
[1:25:23] I don't know why never take things for
[1:25:25] granted
[1:25:29] under the blood
[1:25:31] your sins are not seen by the father
[1:25:36] as a matter of fact
[1:25:38] in the sight of God they don't exist
[1:25:45] he was wounded for our transgression so
[1:25:47] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:25:50] your sins
[1:25:52] no matter how dangerous they are
[1:25:56] your iniquities
[1:25:58] no matter how terrible the way
[1:26:01] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:03] forgives you of them all
[1:26:07] there is no sin
[1:26:09] that is too big that he cannot forgive
[1:26:15] as a matter of God As a matter of fact
[1:26:19] underestimate testing power of God
[1:26:22] when you come to a place to think
[1:26:25] that this sin is too big for him to
[1:26:27] forgive
[1:26:29] limited the power of God
[1:26:34] there is no sin
[1:26:37] there is no iniquity
[1:26:40] that is properly confessed
[1:26:43] under the blood
[1:26:46] that would ever come after you and hunt
[1:26:48] you anymore
[1:26:52] we are humans
[1:26:55] your mind will go down memory lane
[1:26:58] and with God picking filthy things from
[1:27:01] the dairy laundry
[1:27:03] and the devil is good at it
[1:27:06] just to mess your day up
[1:27:10] she will never forget of
[1:27:13] but God looks down and he doesn't see it
[1:27:17] because it's under the blood
[1:27:20] God doesn't see it
[1:27:24] that the devil goes before God
[1:27:27] every day every moment at every
[1:27:30] opportunity
[1:27:31] this is what he has done
[1:27:33] this one he has done again this is what
[1:27:35] he has done again this is what he has
[1:27:37] done again
[1:27:38] and God looks down
[1:27:40] and everything is under the blood and
[1:27:43] the father says I don't see anything
[1:27:46] the Lord can't you see what he has done
[1:27:48] I don't see anything
[1:27:51] getting away with everything
[1:27:53] with some getting away with everything
[1:27:57] you ever did wrong every sin you ever
[1:28:00] committed every iniquity you ever
[1:28:03] committed since you knew were right and
[1:28:06] you couldn't do them
[1:28:08] this you knew were wrong and you went
[1:28:10] ahead and did them
[1:28:11] [Music]
[1:28:12] that under the blood
[1:28:15] when they are confessed under the blood
[1:28:18] praise be to God
[1:28:21] the blood who washes you and you are as
[1:28:25] clean
[1:28:26] as clean as the as clean as will get
[1:28:30] there I know
[1:28:39] order the blood
[1:28:41] every sin
[1:28:45] Is Forgiven
[1:28:47] it's like dropping
[1:28:50] dropping
[1:28:51] dropping ah
[1:28:54] close no matter how dirty it is you drop
[1:28:57] it in a bleach
[1:28:59] it takes everything out of it
[1:29:02] and when God looks down
[1:29:06] upon you
[1:29:08] a son or daughter of God
[1:29:10] he is looking at you
[1:29:13] through the blood screen of the Lord
[1:29:15] Jesus Christ
[1:29:20] the blood
[1:29:22] it's a bumper
[1:29:26] the blood
[1:29:28] of Christ
[1:29:35] was shed for us
[1:29:38] it doesn't matter what condition you
[1:29:41] find yourself in
[1:29:43] there is hope for the living
[1:29:47] if there is any sin if there is any
[1:29:50] iniquity if there is anything you have
[1:29:54] to confess
[1:29:55] confess it under the blood
[1:29:59] let the blood of Christ that was shed
[1:30:02] for us
[1:30:03] take complete control
[1:30:07] and in the sight of God you never did it
[1:30:10] to begin with
[1:30:15] a lot of the times we beat ourselves up
[1:30:19] we can wait until we get headaches and
[1:30:23] and God looks at us and he wonders what
[1:30:26] is going on
[1:30:27] your sins are forgiven
[1:30:31] what are you beating yourself about
[1:30:34] and that is why the devil gets us
[1:30:37] that a time we have to use
[1:30:39] just to praise God and to enjoy more of
[1:30:43] God we easy to think about things we did
[1:30:45] in the time past which don't anymore
[1:30:48] exist
[1:30:50] because the blood has taken control
[1:30:53] praise be to God
[1:30:57] so our problem area has always been
[1:31:00] that we accept
[1:31:05] that by Adam sinning
[1:31:10] we also sin
[1:31:12] that because he fell
[1:31:16] a lot of the times we don't have
[1:31:17] problems here
[1:31:21] but we hardly accept
[1:31:24] that Christ died for us
[1:31:27] and by his righteousness
[1:31:30] we by faith
[1:31:32] have been made righteous
[1:31:35] by once my sin by one must sin our sins
[1:31:40] was by representation
[1:31:43] and our righteousness
[1:31:45] would have to be
[1:31:47] by representation
[1:31:49] your works
[1:31:52] would not do
[1:31:55] and we struggle with this a lot of the
[1:31:57] times
[1:32:01] and Men
[1:32:03] who want to work their way
[1:32:06] through salvation
[1:32:13] it is because we think
[1:32:17] that we become Sinners by the things we
[1:32:19] did
[1:32:21] so to become righteous we have to do
[1:32:24] something
[1:32:28] I don't know
[1:32:30] that for me is the class of tonight's
[1:32:32] message I don't know how many
[1:32:35] are with me here tonight
[1:32:39] that we get to a place to think
[1:32:43] that because I did this this this that
[1:32:47] I became a sinner
[1:32:49] so for me to be a righteous person I
[1:32:52] have to do this this this no
[1:32:56] you became a sinner by representation
[1:32:59] and you'll be a just man and a just
[1:33:03] woman
[1:33:04] by representation
[1:33:07] it is not by your calculation
[1:33:10] it is not by your ability it is not what
[1:33:14] you can do or what you are able to do
[1:33:17] stop working your way through
[1:33:20] stop working your way through
[1:33:23] that would never help you in any way at
[1:33:26] best that will only make you religious
[1:33:35] there are other places
[1:33:37] where the people are here they give
[1:33:40] themselves to be bent to be cut to be
[1:33:43] whipped
[1:33:46] you are just punishing yourself for
[1:33:47] nothing
[1:33:50] you have lost the main cracks
[1:33:54] the main thing you have lost it
[1:33:59] so that is why our struggles are It Is
[1:34:02] by faith
[1:34:03] our righteousness is by faith in Christ
[1:34:06] Jesus it's not by words
[1:34:11] it's by faith
[1:34:13] getting away
[1:34:16] with everything
[1:34:19] Isaiah 1 18.
[1:34:22] if we can turn our Bibles to Isaiah 1
[1:34:25] 18.
[1:34:34] Isaiah 1 18.
[1:34:40] come now
[1:34:43] and let us reason together
[1:34:46] say the Lord
[1:34:49] the Lord himself
[1:34:51] giving us an invitation
[1:34:57] what a wonderful gesture
[1:35:00] now there are some of us here
[1:35:03] in all our lives
[1:35:05] we can only see the White House from a
[1:35:07] distance
[1:35:10] women never enter through those Gates
[1:35:15] but here
[1:35:19] the almighty God
[1:35:21] who created heaven and earth
[1:35:25] is giving us an invitation
[1:35:29] and brother Branham said that she is the
[1:35:32] Lord
[1:35:33] does not fail
[1:35:38] God speaking to his children
[1:35:42] Isaiah 1 18.
[1:35:47] and let us reason to get us here of the
[1:35:49] Lord do your says be a Scarlet
[1:35:52] they shall be as white as snow nor they
[1:35:55] be red like crimson
[1:35:57] they shall be quite as wound
[1:36:02] again
[1:36:03] it doesn't matter
[1:36:06] it doesn't matter what you have gone
[1:36:08] through
[1:36:09] it doesn't matter how much abuse
[1:36:12] you have taken at the hands of the enemy
[1:36:15] it doesn't matter
[1:36:17] what sins and what iniquities you have
[1:36:20] committed
[1:36:21] no
[1:36:23] the Lord is beating you come and let us
[1:36:27] reason together
[1:36:30] come
[1:36:32] let us reason together
[1:36:36] God did not send his only begotten son
[1:36:38] to condemn it
[1:36:41] to the world to condemn it
[1:36:43] better the word through him might be
[1:36:46] saved
[1:36:49] God is not interested in you going to
[1:36:51] hell
[1:36:53] no hair was not made for anybody Head
[1:36:56] was made for Satan and his fallen angels
[1:37:02] God
[1:37:04] has an expected end
[1:37:07] for you
[1:37:09] God has thought of peace concerning you
[1:37:13] know that you are special in the sight
[1:37:16] of God
[1:37:17] know that you are unique in the sight of
[1:37:21] God
[1:37:22] when you get up and you step out there
[1:37:25] know that you are a child of God that is
[1:37:28] working our day
[1:37:29] dress alike
[1:37:31] speak alike behave alike
[1:37:35] conduct yourself as a son as a daughter
[1:37:39] of God conduct yourself alike
[1:37:43] and wherever you find yourself know that
[1:37:47] the angels of the Lord
[1:37:49] is there
[1:37:51] you don't have to see to believe
[1:37:54] because sin is not believing as the
[1:37:57] prophet of God said
[1:37:59] you have to believe
[1:38:00] than you would see
[1:38:03] I know I told a story here before it's a
[1:38:06] story I love
[1:38:07] and I will tell it as much as I can
[1:38:12] praise be to God
[1:38:15] about that little girl
[1:38:17] some of you have heard it once some of
[1:38:19] you have heard it twice
[1:38:21] and probably somebody here over here
[1:38:23] hearing for the first time
[1:38:26] praise be to God
[1:38:30] that little girl that went to church the
[1:38:32] I would go to church
[1:38:34] every evening every Wednesday night and
[1:38:37] would close at 9 30 and on her way home
[1:38:40] she would just be sinking and going he
[1:38:42] said it was a bush Puff
[1:38:44] here in America we are very very
[1:38:46] privileged and as a matter of fact we
[1:38:48] are spoiled
[1:38:50] that we can't even come to church
[1:38:52] when our car is down
[1:38:55] we are very spoiled as a matter of fact
[1:38:58] it doesn't matter how close we live to
[1:39:00] church
[1:39:01] it doesn't matter how good the weather
[1:39:03] is
[1:39:05] if there is a problem with my car and I
[1:39:08] can even drive the further there's a
[1:39:10] problem I'm not coming
[1:39:15] elsewhere
[1:39:18] the church is probably maybe five or ten
[1:39:21] miles away
[1:39:22] and it will take you two hours to get to
[1:39:25] church
[1:39:26] and for some people it even takes longer
[1:39:30] because they are working
[1:39:33] that they will walk by the time they get
[1:39:35] to church they are already dirty
[1:39:37] by the time they get to church they're
[1:39:39] already sweating
[1:39:41] and they go and sit in that room there
[1:39:42] there is no air condition like we have
[1:39:44] it here
[1:39:46] and they sit there and they hear they
[1:39:48] would listen to the word of God
[1:39:53] in America we are support
[1:39:58] because you go asking for coffee and
[1:40:00] they'll ask you the type of coffee you
[1:40:01] want
[1:40:03] they will ask you the type of milk you
[1:40:05] want
[1:40:07] after telling a type of milk you want
[1:40:08] either two percent one percent five
[1:40:10] percent what does that mean foreign
[1:40:22] Lord have mercy
[1:40:26] this was a bush path
[1:40:28] this little guy walks on that bush path
[1:40:31] to go and praise God to close walk on
[1:40:34] that same path to go home
[1:40:36] and she's working and singing and
[1:40:37] praising God not knowing
[1:40:40] a beast of a man
[1:40:44] realized this girl doing this every
[1:40:46] Wednesday and he went and lay Ambush on
[1:40:49] that road
[1:40:51] Wednesday night waiting for this girl
[1:40:53] because he knew that the girl was going
[1:40:56] to walk back on that path
[1:40:58] lo and behold they are flying in the
[1:41:00] bush there when he heard the girl
[1:41:02] singing and coming
[1:41:05] and when the girl got closer
[1:41:08] all he saw were Ant-Man
[1:41:12] the guy was just working she didn't know
[1:41:15] what was going on
[1:41:17] foreign
[1:41:18] she didn't know what was going on she
[1:41:21] was just walking and praising God but
[1:41:24] there were men on the left men on the
[1:41:27] right that were holding arms they were
[1:41:30] out to the tits
[1:41:32] escorting her home
[1:41:35] and he fell down as dead
[1:41:38] till they passed
[1:41:41] I was told the story in 1988.
[1:41:46] these guys came from tema
[1:41:49] uh that was uh in the city
[1:41:52] I was in the north and they were sharing
[1:41:54] that story and this was in a shaman one
[1:41:57] of the most dangerous areas
[1:41:59] it took the regime
[1:42:01] of Rollins to quite to quieten them down
[1:42:05] they were committing armed robberies
[1:42:07] broad daylight and the police wouldn't
[1:42:09] go there
[1:42:12] so when you step out today
[1:42:15] no that God has given his angels charge
[1:42:18] over you musicians you can come over no
[1:42:21] that God has given his angels charge
[1:42:24] over you
[1:42:25] no that you are a son of God that you
[1:42:28] are a daughter of God speak with
[1:42:30] authority and when you speak belief
[1:42:33] because a lot of the times God is
[1:42:36] waiting
[1:42:37] he's just waiting
[1:42:40] to see you move
[1:42:42] to see you act and what do we do we're
[1:42:45] also sitting there and waiting on God
[1:42:49] getting away
[1:42:51] getting away with everything
[1:42:55] getting away with everything
[1:42:58] we have gotten away with everything
[1:43:02] we've gotten away with our sins
[1:43:05] we've gotten away with our iniquities
[1:43:08] we have gotten away with sickness
[1:43:10] everything the fall brought
[1:43:13] upon Humanity we have gotten away from

[1:43:17] not with some we didn't get away with
[1:43:20] some we got away with everything
[1:43:24] under the blood of our Redemption we got
[1:43:26] away with everything
[1:43:29] and the devil can never impute sin or to
[1:43:34] you
[1:43:35] because the Bible says that he that is
[1:43:37] of God sineth not
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:41] the devil can never impute sin on you
