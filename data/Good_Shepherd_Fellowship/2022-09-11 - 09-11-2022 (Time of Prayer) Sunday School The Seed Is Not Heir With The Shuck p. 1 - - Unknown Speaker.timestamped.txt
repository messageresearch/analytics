[2:18] on this occasion to bring
[2:22] a living Christ to a Dying World and a
[2:26] dying generation yes we would ask Lord
[2:30] that you would anoint our words and our
[2:32] efforts

[2:36] but may they accomplish that which they
[2:39] are purpose for
[2:41] help every man woman boy or girl here

[2:55] our hearts like those who came from

[3:48] [Music]
[3:54] it's good tonight to be back here and I
[3:56] see we got a few standing around
[4:00] and I think the
[4:02] phones are open now of the many
[4:05] different cities Across the Nation San
[4:07] Francisco
[4:08] Tucson up in the east
[4:11] and we do the telephone send greetings
[4:15] to them
[4:16] we're in the auditorium here tonight and
[4:18] the main Auditorium is packed out the
[4:20] aisles and around the walls are standing
[4:23] full of people and we understand that
[4:26] tomorrow night we're going to try to
[4:28] open up another side here to the gym and
[4:31] get a larger Auditorium they'll take
[4:33] care of maybe a couple more thousand
[4:35] people so we're hoping that tomorrow
[4:38] night if it's filled up tonight the
[4:40] first night while we believe it'll be
[4:42] greater tomorrow night and I see this
[4:43] set in extra chairs and everything also
[4:46] tonight
[4:47] we're under great anticipations
[4:51] first the coming of the Lord Jesus
[4:54] the next the salvation of
[4:58] to Lost Souls that would receive him
[5:00] tonight and be ready for his coming when
[5:02] he appears
[5:04] I want to offer a special greeting and
[5:08] welcome to all these fine man on the
[5:10] platform which I understand many of them
[5:12] are ministers
[5:13] a couple hundred or more sitting on the
[5:15] platform and we're certainly thankful
[5:18] that they're here
[5:20] to all you people wherever you are in
[5:22] different parts of the nation and I
[5:24] understand that summer Year from across
[5:27] the sea
[5:28] overseas so we're grateful for you to be
[5:31] here to enjoy this fellowship with us
[5:34] which we're under anticipations that God
[5:37] is going to give us during this meeting
[5:39] it seems like that since I thought of
[5:43] coming back for these few days of
[5:44] meeting that my own heart has been
[5:48] alarmed strangely with a great feeling
[5:51] at something's just about to take place
[5:53] I don't know just what it is but I hope
[5:57] it is a great Revelation from God
[5:59] that'll
[6:00] will prepare us and make us better
[6:03] citizens of his kingdom while we're
[6:05] walking in this Dark World of sin and
[6:08] unbelief
[6:10] this ground tonight
[6:12] this very spot
[6:14] holds a great thing for me
[6:18] since I knew that they built this School
[6:21] auditorium here
[6:23] I have wanted to have a service in this
[6:27] place I'm very grateful to the school
[6:29] board and to those who graciously let us
[6:33] have it
[6:35] is upon this spot right about somewhere
[6:38] where this building stands tonight
[6:40] that a great thing took place
[6:43] some 30 years ago right on this same
[6:45] ground
[6:46] it was nothing but a broom Sage field at
[6:49] that time
[6:51] and I lived in a little house just
[6:54] beyond here about 200 yards
[6:57] I was very concerned in those days about
[7:00] the salvation of my father and mother
[7:04] which both are gone on tonight
[7:07] and especially in that day I was
[7:10] concerned about my father
[7:12] I remember I was sleeping on the porch
[7:15] it was warm summertime
[7:17] this is written I believe in the little
[7:20] book called
[7:22] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[7:24] and forever are either it was in a
[7:27] little book called I was not disobedient
[7:29] to the heavenly vision
[7:32] and laying on the porch I suddenly was
[7:35] awakened
[7:37] and
[7:38] a burden come on my heart for my father
[7:42] as many of you people here of the city
[7:45] knew my father
[7:47] I think he was a great man
[7:49] though he was a sinner
[7:52] and but he had a bad habit
[7:56] that I've tried to fight against that
[7:58] thing as hard as I could through the age
[8:00] that's drinking
[8:03] that night he was drinking
[8:06] and I woke up with a great burden on my
[8:08] heart for Him and just with my pajamas
[8:11] on slipped on my trousers my pajama
[8:14] shirt left on I wandered out through
[8:17] this broom Sage field to just about
[8:19] where this stands now
[8:22] and I knelt down to pray for my father
[8:27] and while I was praying and asking God
[8:30] to save him
[8:32] and not uh
[8:34] to let him die a sinner
[8:37] that I loved him
[8:39] and while I was in prayer I raised up to
[8:42] look up towards the east from here and
[8:46] there was a vision
[8:48] and standing just above me many of you
[8:50] knows the vision was
[8:52] the Lord Jesus
[8:54] now I'm not allergic to Illusions as I
[8:58] know of
[8:59] but Visions are real
[9:01] and there stood the Lord Jesus the first
[9:03] time I'd ever saw him in a vision of
[9:06] that type he was just about oh probably
[9:09] 10 feet above my head standing in midair
[9:12] with one foot just making a step
[9:15] he had on a white garment friends around
[9:19] the side of it he had hair down to his
[9:21] shoulders he looked to be about a man
[9:23] about what the Bible said he was about
[9:25] 30 but a small thin built fellow very
[9:29] small looks like he wouldn't weighed
[9:31] over 130 pounds
[9:34] and I looked and I thought there were
[9:36] something that I might uh
[9:38] be wrong so I rubbed my eyes
[9:41] and looked up again and he was standing
[9:44] kind of sideways kind of a profile of
[9:48] his face
[9:49] and the looks of his face which have
[9:52] always seen
[9:53] in the Visions has been like Hoffman's
[9:56] head of Christ at 30. that's the reason
[9:58] I had that in my house on my literature
[10:01] wherever I can put that because that's
[10:03] the way it looked more like that only
[10:05] you seem to be small
[10:08] and uh so I was looking up at him
[10:11] I thought surely I'm not looking at my
[10:14] Lord
[10:15] standing there and I was kind of saying
[10:18] this position
[10:19] it may be right where this underwear
[10:22] this pulpit's at now somewhere it was
[10:24] right in this vicinity within whether a
[10:26] radius of where I'm standing the best I
[10:28] can measure off within 40 or 50 yards of
[10:30] somewhere around in this District here
[10:32] this circle
[10:33] and I looked up and he was standing
[10:35] there
[10:36] and I bit my finger to see if I was
[10:38] asleep
[10:40] you know how you it just seems like it
[10:42] couldn't be so
[10:44] and I was just young in the Lord then
[10:46] about six months I've been preaching I
[10:49] bit my finger I took a broom sage and
[10:51] broke it off at many of you people who
[10:53] live in the country don't want that
[10:54] little toothpick like is and the broom
[10:56] Sage I we're going to chew on that and I
[10:59] said it it can't be I'm a dreaming
[11:01] there's my home there's father mother
[11:04] and the children there there's the Old
[11:06] Brick House Pond that used to stand down
[11:08] here where I used to hunt Ducks just
[11:09] about 200 yards Beyond this and here I
[11:12] am standing in the field it's got to be
[11:14] sold uh kicked against the ground
[11:17] stomped my feet a little bit and shook
[11:19] my head and rung my hands looked up
[11:22] again looked away looked again and there
[11:24] he was standing there
[11:25] and the wind started to blow and I seen
[11:28] the broom Sage blowing and when it
[11:29] started blowing his garments blew with
[11:31] it like a clothes hanging on a line to
[11:34] begin to reflect uh he was standing
[11:36] there I looked at it and I thought if I
[11:39] could just get a look at his face
[11:42] and he was watching East
[11:45] right this away he's watching it
[11:47] intensely
[11:49] and I moved a step around to get a close
[11:52] look at his face and I still couldn't
[11:54] seem very well he had his hands in front
[11:57] of him rather hid from where I was
[11:59] standing I moved around again and I
[12:02] cleared my throat something like this I
[12:04] went
[12:05] to see if I could attract this tension
[12:07] but he never moved
[12:09] then I thought maybe I'll call him
[12:12] when I said Jesus
[12:15] he turned his head and when he looked at
[12:18] me he just raised his arms out that's
[12:21] all I remember for about a nearly
[12:24] daylight I was laying right out here
[12:26] somewhere where this place is now in the
[12:28] field my pajama shirt all wet with tears
[12:32] where I be crying and I had passed out
[12:35] his face had characters that no artist
[12:37] could could draw our paint
[12:40] they could not do it he looked like a
[12:42] man that he would look at him he wanted
[12:44] to cry with sympathy and respect with
[12:47] reverence and yet with enough power that
[12:50] would speak it would turn the world over
[12:52] and the characters could never be caught
[12:54] by an artist
[12:56] and I never know to this day what that
[12:59] meant but here I am tonight after 30
[13:02] years
[13:03] standing in an auditorium it's dedicated
[13:06] now to the service of almighty God and
[13:09] me just a
[13:11] lay member really just a local Elder in
[13:15] the and Baptist Church here which Roy
[13:19] Davis was pastor at the time and I am
[13:23] now standing here with a place crowded
[13:26] right over the same grounds with the for
[13:28] what I think is the purchase of the
[13:31] blood of Jesus Christ himself in my
[13:34] hands to bring this four days message of
[13:38] the Lord
[13:39] just about six months after that I had
[13:41] my first baptism down here on the river
[13:43] when the light came down right there
[13:46] Spring Street many of you people might
[13:48] want to go down take a look at it at
[13:50] Spring Street and water right at the
[13:52] riverfront and there's where the angel
[13:54] of the Lord appeared in public first
[13:57] and uh at two o'clock one afternoon
[14:01] a voice came from it said as John the
[14:04] Baptist was sent to forerun the first
[14:06] coming of Christ your message will
[14:08] forerun the second coming this is 30
[14:10] years later and here I am still tonight
[14:13] proclaiming that message and around the
[14:16] world it's when and I'm glad to be back
[14:19] in my hometown tonight to represent this
[14:21] Lord Jesus Christ that I still love with
[14:24] all my heart each day he grows still
[14:26] sweeter than he was the day before I've
[14:29] never changed one iot in my Doctrine the
[14:32] first thing I started with I still
[14:34] believe the same thing tonight he's the
[14:36] same yesterday today and forever
[14:40] now I have a message that I'm
[14:42] responsible for when the message first
[14:44] started out it of course everybody is
[14:47] praying for the sick Great Signs wonders
[14:50] and miracles that started especially in
[14:52] the Pentecostal people a universal
[14:55] Revival of a healing campaigns that
[14:57] swept the world for 15 solid years
[14:59] there's been revivals on every Hill
[15:02] there he is I suppose Revival fires are
[15:05] burning literally millions have accepted
[15:08] Christ as their savior but that one
[15:10] commission that inspired from there to
[15:13] oral Robertson and so forth and on and
[15:15] on as this went around
[15:17] at the Pentecostal church was laying in
[15:20] his dead slump as it was then my
[15:23] intentions and desire tonight is to
[15:25] awaken that church again to the coming
[15:27] of the Lord Jesus at hand
[15:30] I have to rebuke it I have to rebuke sin
[15:32] in whatever manner it is I don't mean it
[15:35] to anybody's denomination I have a
[15:37] message now it's hard to get in a church
[15:40] for a sponsorship
[15:42] just as it was with our lord Jesus cause
[15:44] it's him it isn't me but as he preached
[15:47] at the first and healed the sick raise
[15:50] the dead he cleanse the lepers and cast
[15:52] out Devils everybody wanted him but
[15:54] there come a time where it is a message
[15:57] that always follows every sign because
[16:00] the sign has a voice
[16:02] but when he sat down one day and said
[16:04] I'm my father or one that was more than
[16:07] they could stand it was also when he
[16:09] said except you eat the Flesh of the son
[16:12] of man and drink his blood you have no
[16:14] life in you how while doctors and
[16:17] well-thinking people would have said
[16:18] this man's a human vampire trying to get
[16:21] you to eat his flesh and drink his blood
[16:23] he never explained it he just said it
[16:27] tonight you might hear things and
[16:29] through the meeting is just said we're
[16:31] not I'll be able to explain but remember
[16:33] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[16:36] and forever we believe
[16:38] now
[16:40] we don't have time to talk too much
[16:42] because we've got certain times to start
[16:44] here and certain times to get out and we
[16:46] want to honor the school board which set
[16:48] these times for us and we'll do all we
[16:50] can to honor them remember at any time a
[16:54] sinner wants to come to Christ all you
[16:57] have to do is walk right up whether I'm
[16:59] preaching singing Whatever it is and
[17:00] give your life to Christ right the
[17:02] understanding your seed that's what
[17:04] we're here for to help you
[17:07] I want to talk to brother Vale

[21:33] in Galatians 4 27 I wish to read these
[21:38] words 4 27 to 31 inclusive for it is
[21:43] written
[21:44] Rejoice thou bearing that bearth not
[21:47] break forth and cry thou that travailth
[21:51] not for the desert has many more
[21:54] children than sea which has a husband
[21:59] now we Brethren as Isaac was
[22:02] are the children of promise
[22:04] but as then he that was born add to the
[22:07] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[22:11] the spirit even so is it now
[22:15] nevertheless what's saith the scripture
[22:18] cast out the bonds woman and her son for
[22:22] the son of the bonds woman shall not be
[22:25] Heir with the son of the free woman
[22:28] so then brethren we are not
[22:32] Children of the bonds woman but of the
[22:36] free
[22:37] the Lord had his blessings to the
[22:40] reading of his word now
