[5:45] and if satan cast out satan he is
[5:47] divided against himself how shall then
[5:49] his kingdom stand
[5:51] and if i by beelzebub cast out devils
[5:54] by whom do your children cast them out
[5:57] therefore they shall be your judges
[6:00] but if i cast out devils by the spirit
[6:02] of god then the kingdom of god has come
[6:04] unto you or else how can one enter into
[6:07] a strong man's house and spoil his goods
[6:10] except he first bind the strong man and
[6:12] then he will spoil his house
[6:15] he that is not with me is against me
[6:18] and he that gathereth not with me
[6:20] scattereth abroad
[6:22] wherefore i say unto you
[6:24] all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
[6:25] forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
[6:27] against the holy ghost shall not be
[6:29] forgiven unto men
[6:30] and whosoever speaketh the word against
[6:32] the son of man it shall be forgiven him
[6:33] but whosoever speaketh against the holy
[6:35] ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[6:37] neither in this world neither in the
[6:39] world to come
[6:41] either make the tree good and his fruit
[6:43] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[6:45] his fruit corrupt for the tree is known
[6:47] by his fruit
[6:49] o generation of vipers
[6:52] how can ye being evil speak good things
[6:56] for out of the abundance of the heart
[6:58] the mouth speaketh
[6:59] a good man out of the good treasure of
[7:01] the heart bringeth forth good things and
[7:03] an evil man out of the evil treasure
[7:05] bringeth forth evil things
[7:07] but i say unto you that every idle word
[7:10] that men shall speak they shall give
[7:11] account thereof in the day of judgment
[7:14] for by thy words thou shalt be justified
[7:16] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[7:20] then certain of the scribes and of the
[7:22] pharisees answered saying master we
[7:24] would see a sign from thee
[7:27] but he answered and said unto them an
[7:29] evil and adulterous generation seeketh
[7:31] after a sign and there shall no sign be
[7:34] given to it but the sign of the prophet
[7:36] jonas
[7:37] for as jonas was three days and three
[7:39] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[7:41] son of man be three days and three
[7:43] nights in the heart of the earth
[7:45] the men of nineveh shall rise in
[7:47] judgment with this generation and shall
[7:49] condemn it
[7:51] because they
[7:52] repented at the preaching of jonas
[7:55] and behold are greater than jonas is
[7:57] here
[7:58] the queen of the south shall rise up in
[8:00] the judgment with this generation and
[8:02] shall condemn it for she came from the
[8:04] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[8:06] wisdom of solomon and behold a greater
[8:08] than solomon is here
[8:10] when the unclean spirit has gone out of
[8:12] a man he walketh through dry places
[8:14] seeking rest and findeth none then he
[8:17] saith i will return into my house from
[8:19] whence i came out
[8:21] and when he has come he findeth it empty
[8:23] swept and garnished then goeth he and
[8:27] taketh with himself seven other spirits
[8:29] more wicked than himself and they enter
[8:31] in and dwell there and the last state of
[8:33] that man is worse than the first
[8:36] and jesus knew their thoughts and said
[8:38] unto them every kingdom divided against
[8:41] itself is brought to desolation and
[8:43] every city or house divided against
[8:45] itself shall not stand
[8:47] and if satan cast out satan he is
[8:49] divided against himself how shall then
[8:51] his kingdom stand
[8:53] and if i by beelzebub cast out devils
[8:57] by whom do your children cast them out
[8:59] therefore they shall be your judges
[9:02] but if i cast out devils by the spirit
[9:04] of god then the kingdom of god has come
[9:07] unto you
[9:08] or else how can one enter into a strong
[9:10] man's house and spoil his goods except
[9:13] he first bind the strong man and then he
[9:15] will spoil his house
[9:18] he that is not with me is against me
[9:21] and he that gathereth not with me
[9:22] scattereth abroad
[9:24] wherefore i say unto you all manner of
[9:27] sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
[9:29] men but the blasphemy against the holy
[9:30] ghost shall not be forgiven unto men
[9:33] and whosoever speaketh the word against
[9:34] the son of man it shall be forgiven him
[9:36] but whosoever speaketh against the holy
[9:38] ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[9:40] neither in this world neither in the
[9:42] world to come
[9:43] either make the tree good and his fruit
[9:46] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[9:48] his fruit corrupt for the tree is known
[9:50] by his fruit
[9:52] o generation of vipers
[9:55] how can ye being evil speak good things
[9:58] for out of the abundance of the heart
[10:00] the mouth speaketh
[10:02] a good man out of the good treasure of
[10:03] the heart bringeth forth good things and
[10:06] an evil man out of the evil treasure
[10:08] bringeth forth evil things
[10:10] but i say unto you that every idle word
[10:12] that men shall speak they shall give
[10:14] account thereof in the day of judgment
[10:16] for by thy words thou shalt be justified
[10:18] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[10:22] then certain of the scribes and of the
[10:24] pharisees answered saying master we
[10:27] would see a sign from thee
[10:29] but he answered and said unto them an
[10:31] evil and adulterous generation seeketh
[10:34] after a sign and there shall no sign be
[10:36] given to it but the sign of the prophet
[10:38] jonas
[10:40] for as jonas was three days and three
[10:41] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[10:43] son of man be three days and three
[10:45] nights in the heart of the earth
[10:47] the men of nineveh shall rise in
[10:49] judgment with this generation and shall
[10:52] condemn it
[10:53] because they
[10:54] repented at the preaching of jonas
[10:57] and behold a greater than jonas is here
[11:01] the queen of the south shall rise up in
[11:03] the judgment with this generation and
[11:05] shall condemn it for she came from the
[11:07] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[11:08] wisdom of solomon and behold a greater
[11:10] than solomon is here
[11:13] when the unclean spirit has gone out of
[11:14] a man he walketh through dry places
[11:17] seeking rest and findeth none then he
[11:19] saith i will return into my house from
[11:22] whence i came out
[11:23] and when he has come he findeth it empty
[11:26] swept and garnished
[11:28] then goeth he and taketh with himself
[11:30] seven other spirits more wicked than
[11:32] himself and they enter in and dwell
[11:34] there and the last state of that man is
[11:36] worse than the first
[11:39] even so shall it be also unto this
[11:41] wicked generation
[11:44] while he yet talked to the people behold
[11:46] his mother and his brethren stood
[11:47] without desiring to speak with him then
[11:50] one said unto him behold thy mother and
[11:51] thy brethren stand without desiring to
[11:53] speak with thee but he answered and said
[11:55] unto him that told him
[11:57] who is my mother
[11:59] and who are my brethren
[12:01] and he stretched forth his hand toward
[12:03] his disciples and said
[12:05] behold my mother and my brethren
[12:08] for whosoever shall do the will of my
[12:09] father which is in heaven the same is my
[12:12] brother and sister and mother
[12:35] the same day went jesus out of the house
[12:37] and sat by the seaside and great
[12:39] multitudes were gathered together unto
[12:41] him so that he went into a ship and sat
[12:43] and the whole multitude stood on the
[12:45] shore
[12:46] and he spake many things unto them in
[12:48] parables saying
[12:50] behold a sower went forth to sow
[12:53] and when he sowed some seeds fell by the
[12:56] wayside and the fowls came and devoured
[12:58] them up
[12:59] some fell upon stony places where they
[13:01] had not much earth and forthwith they
[13:03] sprung up because they had no deepness
[13:05] of earth and when the sun was up they
[13:07] were scorched and because they had no
[13:09] root they withered away
[13:12] and some fell among thorns
[13:14] and the thorns sprung up and choked them
[13:17] but other fell into good ground and
[13:19] brought forth fruit some 100-fold some
[13:22] sixty-fold some thirty-fold
[13:25] who hath ears to hear
[13:28] let him hear
[13:30] and the disciples came and said unto him
[13:32] why speakest thou unto them in parables
[13:36] he answered and said unto them because
[13:37] it is given unto you to know the
[13:39] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[13:41] to them it is not given
[13:43] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[13:45] and he shall have more abundance but
[13:48] whosoever hath not from him shall be
[13:49] taken away even that he have
[13:52] therefore speak i to them in parables
[13:55] because they seeing see not and hearing
[13:58] they hear not neither do they understand
[14:01] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[14:03] isis which saith by hearing he shall
[14:06] hear and shall not understand
[14:08] and seeing ye shall see and shall not
[14:11] perceive
[14:12] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[14:15] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[14:17] their eyes they have closed lest at any
[14:19] time they should see with their eyes and
[14:21] hear with their ears and should
[14:22] understand with their heart and should
[14:24] be converted and i should heal them
[14:28] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[14:31] in your ears
[14:32] for they hear
[14:35] for verily i say unto you that many
[14:37] prophets and righteous men have desired
[14:38] to see those things which ye see and
[14:41] have not seen them and to hear those
[14:43] things which ye hear and have not heard
[14:45] them
[14:47] hear ye therefore the parable of the
[14:49] sower
[14:52] when anyone heareth the word of the
[14:53] kingdom
[14:54] and understandeth it not
[14:56] then cometh the wicked one and catcheth
[14:58] the way that which was sown in his heart
[15:01] this is he which received seed by the
[15:03] wayside
[15:05] but he that received the seed into stony
[15:07] places the same is he that heareth the
[15:10] word and anon with joy receiveth it
[15:13] yet hath he not root in himself but
[15:15] dureth for a while
[15:17] for when tribulation or persecution
[15:19] ariseth because of the word by and by he
[15:22] is offended
[15:24] he also that received seed among the
[15:26] thorns is he that heareth the word
[15:30] and the care of this world and the
[15:32] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[15:35] and he becometh unfruitful
[15:38] but he that received seed into the good
[15:40] ground is he that heareth the word and
[15:42] understandeth it which also beareth
[15:44] fruit and bringeth forth some
[15:46] hundredfold some sixty some thirty
[15:52] another parable put he forth unto them
[15:54] saying
[15:55] the kingdom of heaven
[15:57] is likened unto a man which sowed good
[16:00] seed in his field
[16:02] but while men slept his enemy came and
[16:04] sowed tares among the wheat and went his
[16:07] way
[16:08] but when the blade was sprung up and
[16:10] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[16:12] tares also so the servants of the
[16:14] householder came and said unto him sir
[16:16] did snot thou sow good seed in thy field
[16:18] from whence then hath it tears
[16:21] he said unto them
[16:22] an enemy hath done this
[16:24] the servants said unto him
[16:26] wilt thou then that we go and gather
[16:28] them up
[16:29] but he said nay
[16:31] lest while ye gather up the tares ye
[16:33] root up also the wheat with them
[16:36] let both grow together
[16:39] until the harvest
[16:40] and in the time of harvest i will say to
[16:42] the reapers
[16:44] gather ye together first the tears and
[16:46] bind them in bundles to burn them
[16:48] but gather the wheat into my barn
[16:52] another parable put he forth unto them
[16:54] saying
[16:55] the kingdom of heaven
[16:57] is like to a grain of mustard seed
[17:01] which a man took and sowed in his field
[17:03] which indeed is the least of all seeds
[17:06] but when it is grown it is the greatest
[17:08] among herbs and becometh the tree so
[17:10] that the birds of the air come and lodge
[17:12] in the branches thereof
[17:15] another parable spake unto them the
[17:17] kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven
[17:19] which a woman took and hid in three
[17:22] measures of meal till the whole was
[17:23] leavened
[17:25] all these things spake jesus unto the
[17:27] multitude in parables and without a
[17:29] parable spaking not unto them that it
[17:32] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[17:34] the prophet saying i will open my mouth
[17:36] in parables i will utter things which
[17:38] have been kept secret from the
[17:40] foundation of the world
[17:43] then jesus sent the multitude away and
[17:44] went into the house and his disciples
[17:46] came unto him saying declare unto us the
[17:49] parable of the tares of the field
[17:51] he answered and said unto them
[17:53] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[17:55] of man
[17:56] the field is the world the good seed are
[17:59] the children of the kingdom but the
[18:01] tares are the children of the wicked one
[18:04] the enemy that sow them is the devil
[18:07] the harvest is the end of the world
[18:09] and the reapers are the angels
[18:11] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[18:13] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[18:15] end of this world the son of man shall
[18:17] send forth his angels and they shall
[18:19] gather out of his kingdom all things
[18:21] that offend and them which do iniquity
[18:23] and shall cast them into a furnace of
[18:25] fire
[18:26] there shall be wailing and gnashing of
[18:28] teeth
[18:29] then shall the righteous shine forth as
[18:31] the sun in the kingdom of their father
[18:35] who hath ears to hear
[18:37] let him hear
[18:39] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[18:42] treasure hid in a field the which when a
[18:44] man hath found he hideth and for joy
[18:46] thereof goeth and selleth all that he
[18:48] hath and buyeth that field
[18:51] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[18:53] a merchantman seeking goodly pearls who
[18:56] when he hath found one pearl of great
[18:57] price went and sold all that he had and
[19:00] bought it
[19:02] again
[19:03] the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net
[19:06] that was cast into the sea and gathered
[19:08] of every kind which when it was full
[19:11] they drew to shore and sat down and
[19:13] gathered the good into vessels but cast
[19:15] the bad away
[19:17] so shall it be at the end of the world
[19:18] the angel shall come forth and sever the
[19:20] wicked from among the just and shall
[19:22] cast them into the furnace of fire
[19:25] there shall be wailing and gnashing of
[19:27] teeth
[19:29] jesus saith unto them
[19:31] have ye understood all these things
[19:34] they say unto him
[19:36] yea
[19:36] lord then said he unto them
[19:39] therefore
[19:40] every scribe which is instructed unto
[19:43] the kingdom of heaven
[19:44] is like unto a man that is a householder
[19:47] which bringeth forth out of his treasure
[19:49] things new and old
[19:53] and it came to pass that when jesus had
[19:55] finished these parables he departed
[19:57] thence
[19:58] and when he was come into his own
[19:59] country
[20:00] he taught them in their synagogue in so
[20:02] much that they were astonished and said
[20:04] whence hath this man this wisdom in
[20:06] these mighty works
[20:08] is not this the carpenter's son
[20:11] is not his mother called mary
[20:14] and his brethren james and joseph and
[20:16] simon and judas
[20:17] and his sisters are they not all with us
[20:20] whence then hath this man all these
[20:21] things
[20:23] and they were offended in him
[20:25] but jesus said unto them
[20:27] a prophet is not without honor save in
[20:28] his own country and in his own house
[20:32] and he did not many mighty works there
[20:34] because of their unbelief
[20:37] at that time herod the teatrock heard of
[20:39] the fame of jesus and said unto his
[20:41] servants this is john the baptist he has
[20:43] risen from the dead
[20:45] and therefore mighty works to show forth
[20:47] themselves in him
[20:49] for herod had laid hold on john and
[20:51] bound him and put him in prison for
[20:53] herodius's sake his brother philip's
[20:55] wife
[20:56] but john said unto him it is not lawful
[20:58] for thee to have her
[21:00] and when he would have put him to death
[21:02] he feared the multitude because they
[21:03] counted him as a prophet
[21:05] but when herod's birthday was kept the
[21:07] daughter of herodias danced before them
[21:09] and pleased herod
[21:11] whereupon he promised with an oath to
[21:12] give her whatsoever she would ask and
[21:14] she being before instructed of her
[21:17] mother said
[21:18] give me here john baptist's head in a
[21:20] charger
[21:22] and the king was sorry
[21:24] nevertheless for the oath's sake and
[21:27] them which sat with him at meat he
[21:28] commanded it to be given her and he sent
[21:31] and beheaded john in the prison
[21:33] and his head was brought in a charger
[21:35] and given to the damsel and she brought
[21:37] it to her mother
[21:39] and his disciples came and took up the
[21:41] body and buried it and went and told
[21:44] jesus
[21:46] when jesus heard of it he departed
[21:48] thence by ship into a desert place apart
[21:51] and when the people had heard thereof
[21:52] they followed him on foot out of the
[21:54] cities
[21:55] and jesus went forth and saw a great
[21:57] multitude
[21:58] and was moved with compassion toward
[22:00] them
[22:01] and he healed their sick
[22:03] and when it was evening his disciples
[22:05] came to him saying this is a desert
[22:07] place and the time has now passed send
[22:09] the multitude away that they may go to
[22:10] the villages and buy themselves bitters
[22:13] but jesus said unto them they need not
[22:15] depart
[22:16] give ye them to eat
[22:18] and they say unto him we have here but
[22:19] five loaves and two fishes
[22:22] he said bring them hither to me
[22:25] and he commanded the multitude to sit
[22:26] down on the grass and took the five
[22:28] loaves and the two fishes and looking up
[22:30] to heaven he blessed and break and gave
[22:33] the loaves to his disciples and the
[22:34] disciples to the multitude and they did
[22:37] all eat and were filled and they took up
[22:39] of the fragments that remained twelve
[22:42] baskets full
[22:43] and they that had eaten were about five
[22:46] thousand men
[22:47] beside women and children
[22:50] and straightway jesus constrained his
[22:52] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[22:54] before him onto the other side while he
[22:56] sent the multitudes away
[22:58] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[23:00] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[23:04] and when the evening was come he was
[23:06] there alone
[23:08] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[23:09] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[23:12] contrary
[23:13] and in the fourth watch of the night
[23:14] jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[23:17] and when the disciples saw him walking
[23:19] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[23:21] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[23:24] but straightway jesus spake unto them
[23:26] saying be of good cheer it is i be not
[23:29] afraid
[23:30] and peter answered him and said lord if
[23:32] it be thou
[23:34] bid me come unto thee on the water
[23:36] and he said come
[23:39] and when peter was come down out of the
[23:40] ship he walked on the water to go to
[23:42] jesus
[23:44] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[23:45] was afraid and beginning to sink he
[23:47] cried saying lord save me and
[23:50] immediately jesus stretched forth his
[23:52] hand and caught him and said unto him oh
[23:54] thou of little faith wherefore did thou
[23:57] doubt
[23:58] and when they were come into the ship
[24:00] the wind ceased
[24:02] then they that were in the ship came and
[24:04] worshiped him saying of a truth thou art
[24:07] the son of god
[24:10] and when they were gone over they came
[24:12] into the land of genezeret
[24:14] and when the men of that place had
[24:16] knowledge of him they sent out into all
[24:18] that country round about and brought
[24:20] unto him all that were diseased and
[24:22] besought him that they might only touch
[24:23] the hem of his garment
[24:25] and as many as touched were made
[24:27] perfectly whole
[24:32] then came to jesus scribes and pharisees
[24:35] which were of jerusalem saying
[24:37] why do thy disciples transgress the
[24:39] tradition of the elders
[24:41] for they wash not their hands when they
[24:43] eat bread
[24:45] but he answered and said unto them
[24:47] why do ye also transgress the
[24:49] commandment of god by your tradition
[24:51] for god commanded saying honor thy
[24:53] father and mother
[24:55] and he that curseth father or mother let
[24:57] him die the death but ye say whosoever
[25:00] shall say to his father or his mother it
[25:02] is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be
[25:04] profited by me
[25:06] and honor not his father or his mother
[25:08] he shall be free
[25:10] thus have ye made the commandment of god
[25:12] of non-effect by your tradition
[25:15] ye hypocrites well the desires prophesy
[25:18] of you saying this people draweth nigh
[25:20] unto me with their mouth and honoureth
[25:22] me with their lips but their heart is
[25:24] far from me
[25:26] but in vain do they worship me teaching
[25:28] for doctrines the commandments of men
[25:31] and he called the multitude and said
[25:33] unto them hear and understand
[25:37] not that which goeth into the mouth
[25:39] defileth the man
[25:41] but that which cometh out of the mouth
[25:43] this defileth the man
[25:46] then came his disciples and said unto
[25:47] him knowest thou that the pharisees were
[25:49] offended after they heard this saying
[25:52] but he answered and said every plant
[25:54] which my heavenly father hath not
[25:56] planted shall be rooted up
[25:58] let them alone
[25:59] they be blind leaders of the blind
[26:02] and if the blind lead the blind
[26:05] both shall fall into the ditch
[26:07] then answered peter and said unto him
[26:10] declare unto us this parable
[26:12] and jesus said
[26:13] are ye also yet without understanding
[26:17] do not ye yet understand that whatsoever
[26:19] entereth in at the mouth goes into the
[26:21] belly and is cast out into the draft
[26:24] but those things which proceed out of
[26:26] the mouth
[26:27] come forth from the heart
[26:29] and they defile the man
[26:32] for out of the heart proceed evil
[26:34] thoughts
[26:35] murders adulteries fornications
[26:38] thefts false witness
[26:40] blasphemies
[26:42] these are the things which defile a man
[26:45] but to eat with unwashing hands defileth
[26:47] not a man
[26:50] then jesus went thence and departed into
[26:52] the coasts of tyre and zidane
[26:54] and behold a woman of canaan came out of
[26:56] the same coasts and cried unto him
[26:58] saying have mercy on me o lord thou son
[27:00] of david my daughter is grievously vexed
[27:03] with a devil
[27:05] but he answered her not a word
[27:07] and his disciples came and besought him
[27:09] saying sent her away for she crieth
[27:11] after us
[27:12] but he answered and said
[27:14] i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
[27:17] the house of israel
[27:19] then came she and worshipped him saying
[27:21] lord help me
[27:23] but he answered and said it is not me to
[27:25] take the children's bread and to cast it
[27:27] to dogs
[27:28] and she said truth lord yet
[27:31] the dogs
[27:32] eat of the crumbs which fall from their
[27:34] master's table
[27:36] then jesus answered and said unto her
[27:38] o woman
[27:40] great is thy faith
[27:41] be it unto thee even as thou wilt
[27:44] and her daughter was made whole from
[27:46] that very hour
[27:48] and jesus departed from thence and came
[27:50] nigh unto the sea of galilee and went up
[27:52] into a mountain and sat down there and
[27:55] great multitudes came unto him having
[27:57] with them those that were lame blind
[27:59] dumb maimed and many others and cast
[28:03] them down at jesus feet and he healed
[28:05] them in so much that the multitude
[28:07] wondered when they saw the dumb to speak
[28:09] the maimed to behold the lame to walk
[28:12] and the blind to see
[28:14] and they glorified the god of israel
[28:18] then jesus called his disciples unto him
[28:20] and said
[28:21] i have compassion on the multitude
[28:23] because they continue with me now three
[28:24] days and have nothing to eat and i will
[28:26] not send them away fasting lest they
[28:28] faint in the way
[28:30] and his disciples say unto him
[28:32] when should we have so much bread in the
[28:34] wilderness as to fill so great a
[28:35] multitude
[28:37] and jesus saith unto them
[28:39] how many lobes have you and they said
[28:42] seven
[28:43] and a few little fishes
[28:45] and he commanded the multitude to sit
[28:46] down on the ground and he took the seven
[28:49] loaves and the fishes and gave thanks
[28:52] and break them and gave to his disciples
[28:54] and the disciples to the multitude and
[28:56] they did all eat and were filled
[28:59] and they took up of the broken meat that
[29:00] was left seven baskets full
[29:04] and they that did eat were four thousand
[29:06] men beside women and children
[29:09] and he sent away the multitude and took
[29:12] ship and came into the coasts of magdala
[29:17] [Music]
[30:04] you
