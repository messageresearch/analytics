[2:57] thousand lives are in danger may he

[3:08] may his Spirit
[3:10] now come to them and console them and
[3:13] send rescue quickly and may no lives be
[3:16] lost we ask this in Jesus Christ's name
[3:22] amen God bless
[3:28] you
[3:34] good morning to you my friends may God's
[3:37] blessings be with you
[3:40] my U people has always said when I when
[3:45] I was speaking I always spoke too long
[3:48] I'll do my very best this morning not to
[3:51] do that I just lay my watch out here
[3:54] maybe I can watch it about 15
[3:57] minutes it's always a pleasure to get to
[3:59] be in this Philadelphian church and
[4:02] among its members and be with its
[4:06] [Music]
[4:07] Pastor uh I have considered brother
[4:10] maton Bose to be one of the best friends
[4:15] I have on this Earth as and the among
[4:18] the ministers he is a very dear brother
[4:21] to me and I I love him and I love his
[4:25] people and because they are God's people
[4:30] I had the privilege just now of meeting
[4:32] brother Stonewell the converted
[4:35] scientist and I just wish that this
[4:38] whole church had the burden of souls on
[4:42] their heart as brother stonell has at
[4:44] this time I was just thinking as I was
[4:47] speaking to him of that little baby
[4:52] innocence and how his heart just yearns
[4:55] and burns setting talk in the tears in
[4:58] his eyes and how that a real rough
[5:02] sinner May brought down by the power of
[5:05] God to that place if we could just all
[5:07] get in that attitude I said brother
[5:09] Stell don't never lose that wonderful
[5:13] something that that it's the cream all
[5:18] for the top of the milk and I pray that
[5:21] God will keep that man that way and and
[5:25] we'll bless him because he's a wonderful
[5:27] spirit he has a not because he's sitting
[5:29] here at the platform but uh that's true
[5:32] and um I said no matter what anyone says
[5:36] what any groups of people says just keep
[5:39] your mind set right on him and they may
[5:43] Bank everything around you it look so
[5:45] black you can't hardly see over just
[5:46] don't worry he he can lift us up above
[5:49] the shadows and he he takes us through
[5:52] his power is a drawing he said if I be
[5:55] lifted up I will draw all men unto me
[5:59] and now
[6:00] tonight is the service that we're to
[6:04] have tonight is to be the the of course
[6:08] the closing service we just had the two
[6:11] and I did this for our brother Bose and
[6:15] for you dear people who are around here
[6:18] and more I hear about the uh your love
[6:23] for Christ of course the more I love you
[6:25] that's right and now I believe that
[6:28] we're living in the most wonderful age
[6:31] that's ever been on the earth we're
[6:33] going to want someday over in a great
[6:36] Millennium we're just going to think oh
[6:39] if I just have know it was in this way
[6:41] what I would have done oh how much more
[6:44] I could have done if I just know what it
[6:45] was going to be well now you don't know
[6:48] it but by faith we act faith is the
[6:51] substance of things hope for the
[6:53] evidence of Things Not Seen is that
[6:56] right see Faith doesn't see it doesn't
[6:59] doesn't see with these eyes it sees with
[7:01] the inward eyes see all the Christian
[7:04] armor the whole armor of Christianity is
[7:07] Supernatural there's nothing to be seen
[7:10] if the whole person deals with the
[7:13] supernatural look at the Christian armor
[7:15] love joy peace longsuffering goodness
[7:19] meekness gentleness patience is that
[7:21] right all those things are the Christian
[7:24] armor see that's the inside man that by
[7:28] faith looks do these eyes and sees the
[7:30] things that is not Abraham was a man who
[7:35] being old and his his life was uh stream
[7:40] was dead within him and Sarah his wife
[7:42] was near 100 and and yet he staggered
[7:45] not at the promise of God through
[7:47] unbelief but was strong giving glory to
[7:51] God see for he endured seen him who is
[7:54] invisible he didn't he didn't have to
[7:57] look at the natural he seen the super
[7:59] Supernatural all the time that's the way
[8:01] we want to do look at the Unseen what is
[8:04] the Unseen well for your healing God
[8:06] promised you healing God said it's there
[8:09] now you how many believe that's the
[8:11] truth say
[8:13] am uh I just like to hear the word amen
[8:16] means so be it did you how many would
[8:19] say I would like to have a a acorn tree
[8:24] Oak Tree in my front yard and somebody
[8:27] gives you an acorn now you've got the
[8:30] tree in seed Farm is that right well you
[8:34] just might as well Rejoice cuz you got
[8:35] the tree is that right you just got it
[8:38] in seed form but it's it'll it'll
[8:40] produce you take this Acorn and you put
[8:43] it in the ground a little box somewhere
[8:45] and set it in the house and keep it
[8:47] watered the first thing you know up
[8:48] comes a Little Acorn Tree is that right
[8:50] then you trans set it out into the yard
[8:52] it just keeps growing but you can praise
[8:54] God just as soon as you get the acorn is
[8:57] that right because you've got the tree
[8:59] already is that right now when God said
[9:02] I'm the Lord and heal of the just start
[9:04] praising you got it you got it right
[9:06] then you say well I don't see any
[9:08] results but that's don't make any
[9:09] difference you got it anyhow see because
[9:12] the word of God is a seed is that right
[9:15] and we are sold with The Incorruptible
[9:16] seed of God see it can't perish it's
[9:20] Incorruptible and I here's a statement
[9:24] that I usually make in the healing
[9:25] Services the right mental attitude
[9:28] towards any Divine promise of God will
[9:30] bring it to pass that's right because
[9:32] it's a seed it has to and the right
[9:36] mental attitude you just take the right
[9:37] mental attitude towards any Divine
[9:39] promise watch it
[9:41] materialize see no matter how it looks
[9:43] if it looks impossible if God said so he
[9:46] makes it possible that wonderful all
[9:49] right
[9:51] now I told Billy this morning he said
[9:54] now daddy you'll have them people up
[9:55] there till they won't get their dinner
[9:56] or nothing else and we've got to get out
[9:58] of this hotel is certain times said you
[9:59] start preaching I know you I said get a
[10:02] seat and sit down give me 15 minutes
[10:04] he's got his seat he's
[10:07] watching and here I am done going into
[10:09] my 15 minutes that's the way it goes
[10:12] always but well I tell you it's just
[10:17] surreal you see I I have a food that I
[10:22] eat that the world knows nothing
[10:26] about and your spirit coming to me in
[10:30] faith believing what I'm telling you is
[10:32] the truth is the food that I live on
[10:35] that's my eternal life if I don't feed
[10:38] this natural man it'll die and if I
[10:41] don't feed this spiritual man it'll die
[10:44] now our brother scientists sitting here
[10:46] would know that anything that doesn't
[10:49] eat very much and just keep going die
[10:51] and dieting your stomach
[10:53] shrinks and then if you become eating a
[10:55] whole lot your stomach you require more
[11:00] I sure I'm a glutton on this I tell you
[11:03] I really require a whole lot of it
[11:07] because I my capacity just has no
[11:10] limits I've often said if I was just a
[11:13] little bigger maybe I could feel better
[11:15] you know and if it was I don't know how
[11:18] I could contain it I believe we'll have
[11:20] to have an immortal body uh to contain I
[11:24] think of what about it friend now we're
[11:26] just all home folks here aren't we so
[11:29] now just what when the battle's all over
[11:33] the last shots been fired arms are
[11:37] stack smokes all died down and we sat
[11:41] down for that wedding supper now could
[11:44] you imagine that I can just think of it
[11:47] look down through that great table set
[11:49] down Earth for hundreds of
[11:52] miles I look down through there and I
[11:54] look across and here sits mass and B
[11:56] sitting right

[12:21] start running down our cheeks the
[12:23] Angelic being standing back and soft
[12:26] Angelic music's going what a
[12:30] morning and I can see as we're looking
[12:33] across the table to one another and
[12:34] looking down through there seeing who
[12:35] all there the tears running down our
[12:38] cheeks as we reach across the table to
[12:39] one of their's hands and gripping like
[12:41] that across the table then I can hear
[12:44] the angels move back bow their heads
[12:47] look come walking out on from behind
[12:49] those doors there he comes the King of
[12:52] Kings the Lord of lords walk down along
[12:55] the table and wiping each one's eyes and
[12:57] putting his arms I'm said now don't cry

[13:01] now all of them here there's not any of
[13:04] them gone they're all here now enter
[13:06] into the joys of the Lord oh my heart
[13:11] jumps when I think of it that's not
[13:14] these little fiction stories of Santa
[13:16] Claus that's thus sayth the
[13:19] Lord that's the seed that's right now
[13:22] becoming materialized right now it's
[13:24] moving in the Lord bless you now we're
[13:27] going to have word of prayer and then go
[13:30] right into the service for just a few
[13:32] moments father we love you and our
[13:35] hearts are bleeding to you and now it
[13:39] has fallen by poor unprofitable servants
[13:43] time to speak just a few moments and I
[13:45] pray that you will help us not knowing
[13:47] what to say but knowing that thou has
[13:49] said if you'll open your mouth I'll put
[13:51] the words in so you said take no fault
[13:54] what you shall say for it's not you that
[13:57] speaks it's your father that dwell in
[13:59] you he doeth the speaking I believe
[14:02] that's the truth I know it is the truth
[14:05] for you said so and you are all truth
[14:08] the very Fountain of truth there's
[14:10] nothing contaminated to come out of it
[14:13] nothing wrong nothing in a lie it's got
[14:15] to be the resource of all truth and from
[14:19] there you said these words now God bless
[14:22] us today bless this little church bless
[14:24] its humble little Pastor here our
[14:26] brother and all the new brothers and
[14:28] brother Stonewell and the strangers in
[14:31] our gates and make us all a blessing to
[14:33] thy kingdom today as we bless each other
[14:36] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[14:40] amen I might be able to open up the
[14:44] Bible leaves but there's only one who
[14:47] can open the
[14:49] scripture in the Book of Revelations it
[14:52] said there was a book that was sealed
[14:55] with Seven Seals and no man in heaven no
[14:58] no man in earth or no one beneath the
[15:00] Earth was was worthy to come and take it
[15:03] and to open the book and to loose the
[15:05] seals and then John saw a lamb that has
[15:08] been slain from the foundation of the
[15:10] world and it came and taken the book and
[15:13] opened the seals and the all the Angelic
[15:15] beings cried Thou Art Worthy for thou
[15:17] was slain from the foundation of the
[15:19] world and that's I might turn back the
[15:21] pages like this I might by some theology
[15:25] be able to give you my views of it but
[15:27] there's only one can open it that's the
[15:30] lamb that was slain from the foundation
[15:31] of the world and may his presence now
[15:34] come and take the word of God and place
[15:37] it in each heart just where it has need
[15:39] of I pray that he will do it while I
[15:42] read some of it out of the out of the
[15:45] Bible in the 2 uh2 chapter of St
[15:49] Matthews beginning with the 41st verse I
[15:53] wish to read down the 46th verse
[15:57] inclusive um
[15:59] I'm as everyone knows that I'm not a
[16:02] preacher as I would call a preacher I'm
[16:05] as I said as the spare tire and you only
[16:09] use a spare tire when you got a flat but
[16:11] we haven't got a flat this morning but
[16:13] it just happened to be time to speak
[16:16] just a few moments and you pray with me
[16:19] as I talk to you about this
[16:22] text and while the Pharisees were
[16:25] gathered together Jesus asked them
[16:27] saying what think ye of Christ whose son
[16:30] is he and they said unto him the son of
[16:33] David and he said unto them how then
[16:37] does David in spirit call him Lord
[16:40] saying the Lord said unto my Lord set
[16:43] thou on my right hand till I make thine
[16:46] enemies thy footstool if David then
[16:50] called him Lord how is he his
[16:55] son and no man was able to answer answer
[16:58] him a word neither D any man from that
[17:03] day forth ask him any more
[17:06] questions may he add His blessings to
[17:09] that word and now for a few moments I'd
[17:12] like to take this if you'd call it a
[17:15] text um what think ye of Christ after
[17:18] you seen all these meetings and
[17:20] everything what do you think of Christ
[17:22] whose son is he that's been a an old
[17:26] dispute Through the Ages through the
[17:28] scientists and through the the
[17:30] evolutionists and so forth what was
[17:33] Christ who was he and and it's just as
[17:36] simple as the question is which was
[17:39] first the hen or the Egg you've heard
[17:41] that which the hen come from the egg and
[17:43] which is first hen or egg well the hen
[17:45] was God made the hen the hen laid the
[17:47] egg that's just as simple as anything
[17:49] but they always asking the H come out of
[17:51] the egg so how which his first hen or
[17:53] egg so God made the hen the hen laid the
[17:55] egg the hen was first and um
[17:59] now that's the same thing about the sci
[18:02] scientific research of the bloodstream
[18:05] of Jesus Christ we all know that the
[18:08] Christ was the Virgin born son of God
[18:11] and many unbelievers today try to deny
[18:14] that the woman could have the baby
[18:16] without first having a a sexual uh
[18:20] desire uh from uh being born of sex by
[18:23] the the male well they said that a hen
[18:26] could not lay an egg
[18:29] without uh if it couldn't be fertile of
[18:31] course if the male bird she can lay an
[18:33] egg but she the egg won't hatch unless
[18:36] it's been with the male see and a
[18:39] scientist once told me not speaking
[18:41] scientist because my brother's here but
[18:44] there was a scientist once went hunting
[18:46] with me out in the west and I met him
[18:49] and he was about the roughest fell I
[18:50] ever seen he said do you mean to tell me
[18:53] when I told him I was a preacher he said
[18:55] you look too intelligent to be there and
[18:57] I said well um I said well not disputing
[19:00] your words sir but I believe that's the
[19:02] mark of intelligence and he said he said
[19:05] well anybody would ble such a story as
[19:07] that and I said well what do you mean he
[19:10] said well such as that virgin birth he
[19:13] said you you know you know better than
[19:15] that I said no sir I'll admit I don't
[19:16] know any better I said that's that's
[19:18] just all I know and he said well you
[19:21] mean to tell me that woman could have a
[19:23] baby without being so that was Joseph
[19:25] that man that she was going with is a
[19:27] little slip up like have all time I said
[19:29] oh no God makes no slip ups that was
[19:33] absolutely God's son he said well there
[19:35] is no such a thing I said you mean
[19:37] there's not a Creator who made the
[19:38] heavens and earth he said no of course
[19:41] not he said oh it's psychology I said
[19:43] well how' the world get here said it was
[19:45] here when I come here I said yes that's
[19:48] right and the room you was born in was
[19:50] there when you got there and the
[19:51] furniture was arranged but some
[19:52] intelligent had to arrange it that way
[19:54] that's exact why if it would be silly
[19:58] D I say well how'd that watch come well
[20:01] it's just a watch that's all it just
[20:03] happened to be a watch well now the
[20:05] timing the jewels and everything anybody
[20:08] with with mentally balanced right would
[20:10] know that some intelligence made that
[20:12] watch had to time it and regulate it and
[20:14] put the hands and jewels and the
[20:15] operation well then how much greater is
[20:18] your body than this watch see because it
[20:21] was a man that made this watch and
[20:23] somebody had to make the man so a person
[20:26] says that we just happen to be that
[20:28] shows his a mental deficiency somewhere
[20:31] that's right so he said well now he
[20:34] began to tell me the ethics of Darwin
[20:35] and so forth about how Evolution came
[20:37] into existence how the world and the Sun
[20:40] and the Moon you've read it perhaps Had
[20:41] A Love Affair and chipped off a little
[20:43] piece and it flew off and that made the
[20:45] world and the first man was a sponge and
[20:47] he wore a little Ward on this side and
[20:49] Out Come an arm and then he decided he
[20:50] want a little arm on the other side so
[20:52] it rolled a few thousand years over on
[20:53] that side and Arm come
[20:55] out I said look fell
[20:59] I'm kind of weak in faith I said I I
[21:01] don't believe that I can't believe it I
[21:03] said I just believe way God said it was
[21:05] I said the only way you can prove that
[21:07] by faith you can't prove it any other
[21:08] way I said my Faith's too weak for that
[21:11] I said I just I Haven got that much
[21:13] faith I just believe that God made it
[21:14] the way he said he did and he said I
[21:17] said he said all about the Virgin bir he
[21:20] said it's it's proven Reverend brand
[21:22] that that corn everything else has to
[21:24] have a Poland the pin and the cor and
[21:27] for the tree and the how the bees packet
[21:29] and everything has to have actual male
[21:32] and female I said sure there was a male
[21:34] in this respect I said that was God well
[21:36] is God a man I said God's a spirit oh
[21:39] impossible to contact the actual human
[21:42] being it has to be the sex part I said
[21:45] oh no I said now look you will admit to
[21:48] me will you that the woman had the baby
[21:50] we'll say that that was right the woman
[21:51] had the baby and he was Jesus yes that
[21:53] that I'll go with you that far cuz
[21:55] there's some kind of a something's going
[21:57] on through the world and to come down
[21:59] history and so forth that there was one
[22:00] here called Jesus but he was no virgin
[22:02] born I said then we you'll admit that he
[22:05] had a natural mother yes now he in your
[22:08] estimation he' have to have an actual
[22:11] father a Earthly man here to be his
[22:13] father or he could not have been born he
[22:16] said that's exactly right I said will
[22:18] you stick with that Mr je he said I will
[22:21] I said all right I want to ask you
[22:22] something then if if this woman had the
[22:26] baby and you you said it was impossible
[22:29] it had to have a natural father it had
[22:32] to have a Earthly father as same as it
[22:33] had a Earthly mother so that's exactly
[22:35] trth I said then how did the first man
[22:37] get here without father or
[22:40] Mother where did he come from let he be
[22:42] tadp monkey whatever he wanted to be
[22:45] according to science he had to have a
[22:47] father and a mother is that right I said
[22:49] who was his father and
[22:52] mother well he asked no more questions
[22:55] from that time saying it just said it
[22:58] that was all he he he didn't have oh I
[23:01] tell you their argument is thinner than
[23:04] the broth made out of a shadow of a
[23:07] chicken is starve to death I they just
[23:09] haven't got a they haven't got a leg to
[23:12] stand on no sir Jesus Christ was the son
[23:15] of God I believe it with all my heart
[23:18] and the great holy spirit overshadowed
[23:21] that virgin and she brought forth the
[23:22] son according to God's word for said a
[23:25] virgin shall conceive and bring forth
[23:26] the child his name name Shall be Called
[23:28] Emmanuel and I he was God With Us I
[23:31] believe that not God that will be with
[23:34] us for a space but be with us forever we
[23:36] are his children living in his presence
[23:38] now and the weakness of the church today
[23:41] is one of the the fundamental reasons
[23:44] that we see no more going on in the
[23:46] church first thing I think is because
[23:48] there's not enough travel of soul to
[23:50] bring the person in contact with his
[23:52] maker and another thing is this is the
[23:55] person who does find God doesn't realize
[23:58] who he is after he's found God that's
[24:00] right if you only realize at you're
[24:02] setting now with Christ
[24:05] Jesus that many of the people are trying
[24:08] to post it off to some other great age
[24:10] and all healing over the Millennium and
[24:12] so forth and all the Miracles over to
