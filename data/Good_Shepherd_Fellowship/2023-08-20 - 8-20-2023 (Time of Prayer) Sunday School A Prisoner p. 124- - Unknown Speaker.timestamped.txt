[1:09] I'll do it so
[1:20] this great priest years ago
[1:23] father Kennedy you ought to get his book
[1:25] to recently call him father he's just
[1:26] his brother chinnicky what it was we
[1:28] don't call him his father like that so
[1:30] we find it let me uh he's gonna read the
[1:34] Bible so as you get out there and just
[1:36] through the partial religion the big
[1:38] long Catholic if I want to read the
[1:40] Bible the Holy Spirit to look what I
[1:42] need God's holy ghosts
[1:45] so then
[1:47] notice this
[1:50] that Moses got all the training the
[1:53] class he he knew he was so small so
[1:58] educated so intellectual first nobody he
[2:01] can even teach the Egyptians
[2:04] he's a teacher psychologist he's a
[2:07] teacher the generals what military might
[2:10] love so he's a great man and people fear
[2:14] noses because of his grace his soul was
[2:16] such a scholarship mind he was a
[2:19] relationship a Mania like a polk he was
[2:22] a great felt and he was a a Mighty Man
[2:26] and he knows that he was born to do this
[2:29] and that trained with great Ambitions to
[2:32] do it just like today I don't say that
[2:35] man's training in these schools I don't
[2:39] see that like you're out here in the
[2:41] west now they're going to build a
[2:43] 150 million dollars uh School of
[2:47] Theology
[2:48] see Pentecostal a hot
[2:53] 150 million dollar School
[2:57] for me that should be missionaries in
[3:00] the field man amen amen but whatever
[3:03] what do they do when they come out of
[3:05] there what are they about drinking just
[3:07] did that and then that's how they come
[3:10] out was always have the rest of them and
[3:11] that's the same line see now we find out
[3:15] that when uh Moses in all this training
[3:19] and today with all the training making
[3:23] big Bishops and so forth a great High
[3:25] Ambitions what do we do our Ambitions
[3:29] become just about at what Moses was see
[3:33] God before he could get the man in his
[3:36] hand you are just spinning
[3:38] of his ambition they're the stripping of
[3:42] all this dream he did go out and he
[3:45] delivered
[3:46] he'd kill one Egyptian
[3:48] and he uh and when he did he found out
[3:52] that he was in the wrong he couldn't do
[3:54] that it wasn't that day and God had to
[3:56] take him out into the wilderness into
[3:59] the desert
[4:01] a desert place
[4:05] how these fellows that God got a message
[4:09] for him he takes them into the desert
[4:14] he took Paul to the desert yeah
[4:18] to train to tell him on all this great
[4:21] vision
[4:22] what
[4:23] out into the desert
[4:25] we're out to a certain desert and he
[4:27] stayed there until God fully made no one
[4:31] what to do
[4:32] time
[4:34] he's talking out in the desert
[4:37] catching out there for 40 years
[4:40] and strict him of all this Theology and
[4:43] all his ambition
[4:45] oh what a time that he could look back
[4:48] and see his failure now we deny ought to
[4:53] do the same thing
[4:55] when we see our ambition look at the
[4:59] healing campaign
[5:01] as soon as the Lord did something a few
[5:03] years ago to start restoring healing to
[5:06] the sick and so forth everybody every
[5:09] organization is because it didn't come
[5:12] into their organization they had to get
[5:13] them A Healer
[5:15] and what have we done let's look at it
[5:18] just a moment
[5:19] we are doing the same thing that Moses
[5:22] did
[5:23] we went out and tried so hard to
[5:25] manufacture some kind of America I smelt
[5:29] a disease I got blood in my hand and a
[5:33] manufacturer of Miracles
[5:35] see and what have we got to have a man
[5:38] in such large screens just broke up and
[5:41] become regular Jokers neurology
[5:50] Pentecostal objective back to making
[5:52] organizations and things again
[5:56] through about one Egyptian
[6:00] that's right
[6:01] and we've tried we strain we hate we
[6:04] labored all night long the crab eating
[6:08] soup we had more bison and try to
[6:10] manufacture something soup up something
[6:12] and all these kinds of things and find
[6:14] it to be a total failure we're here
[6:17] going back to this amen right yes sir
[6:24] Christine is the struggles
[6:27] why not just give up
[6:29] that's what you ought to do amen go back
[6:32] and give us what we've done the same
[6:34] thing they did same thing Moses did it
[6:37] doesn't do any good and it's your 40
[6:39] years he found himself a prisoner to the
[6:42] word of God
[6:44] what do we try to do when the great
[6:46] blessing come out on the manifestation
[6:49] of all these great things that God has
[6:51] told us about how do we must be born
[6:54] again how is receive the Holy Ghost the
[6:57] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and
[7:00] all these things here you see people
[7:02] instead of staying to that word harness
[7:04] to it what do they do that started with
[7:07] their own denominational Theory which is
[7:10] already fails
[7:11] and try to manufacture something to look
[7:13] like the truth
[7:15] oh helpful
[7:17] I better cut off right now see I'm sure
[7:20] you're wise enough to know what I mean
[7:22] see but why look what it's done think of
[7:25] it
[7:25] what have we got tonight but a a nation
[7:29] full of organized people who deny the
[7:34] scriptures of God amen amen who would
[7:37] call the the right of the holy spirit
[7:39] that it was a middle telepathy
[7:43] who would refuse such to come into the
[7:45] church
[7:47] and they wouldn't permit you to mention
[7:49] one word a serpent seed eternal security
[7:52] and a thing that the Holy Spirit has
[7:54] revealed it proved amen
[8:00] what have they got the same thing that
[8:02] Luther had the rest of them see
[8:05] slew an Egyptian what much what was it
[8:08] maybe made some men start stop stealing
[8:12] or maybe live true to his wife
[8:15] well what did you make you know that a
[8:17] church member nothing John Harvard
[8:20] see
[8:21] that's stinking dead man
[8:24] was always any of your 40 fingers too of
[8:28] his success of 40 years of training
[8:30] a snake in addition laying there Walking
[8:34] Dead that's about the way it is
[8:39] a stinking versus church members that
[8:42] knows more about God than a Hot Topic
[8:45] tonight
[8:47] let me tell them about the word of God
[8:49] to say I don't believe that I don't care
[8:51] what you say I don't believe it
[8:53] okay yeah that's an awful thing to have
[8:55] to point back to for all the strains and
[8:58] struggles and everything we got
[8:59] naturally because we're into a big
[9:01] school but then
[9:02] [Music]
[9:12] return back
[9:15] one good Egyptian no doubt but somebody
[9:18] says Moses love us hey you've got no
[9:20] more feeling for the people you was
[9:22] called to somebody that noticed Moses
[9:24] nobody was called for that I didn't know
[9:26] if you lost the feeling of the people
[9:28] nurse her but why don't you all doing
[9:30] this why should I are trying this and
[9:31] why don't you go on with the rest of
[9:33] them Moses is out there getting stripped
[9:35] until he had an experience of the Bernie
[9:38] Bush that declared the word I am the god
[9:41] of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I
[9:43] remember myself

[10:11] of Bernie Bush the mighty Moses was all
[10:15] of his Israelites
[10:17] the bible say that Moses is a mighty man
[10:20] and word or indeed down in Egypt but
[10:23] what what the mighty theologians did in
[10:25] the presence in the burning bush
[10:27] he always confessed his inability amen
[10:31] when he seen the genuine purpose of God
[10:35] he confessed that he was inability to do
[10:38] it again he was trained in all of
[10:39] theology I think again amen

[13:21] talk well when God got him in his hands
[13:24] where he can only move well God moves
[13:28] you what he told him the word
[13:32] then he submitted himself to the Lord
[13:34] and the Holy Spirit their God promised
[13:38] Moses to the will of God that's the same
[13:41] thing he's done to fall
[13:43] that's right amen
[13:45] he harnessed Paul little crooked those
[13:48] Tire tastic Jews oh a p-h-e-l-d's wrote
[13:52] All Over Me
[13:54] but he said I'm going to show him what
[13:55] he's going to suffer from the words
[13:57] [Music]
[14:03] as soon as Jesus
[14:08] to him the love of God harnessed him to
[14:12] the word
[14:13] he's going to Bear my name before the
[14:15] Gentile there he went
[14:17] Moses
[14:18] are the god of your fathers I'm the god
[14:22] of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob I remember
[14:26] a promise him and the time of the
[14:29] promises here now through the
[14:31] afflictions of my people I remember my
[14:33] promise and I have come down the horn
[14:36] and shoot
[14:37] you know what the word says now who is
[14:41] you to go down there or is she with
[14:44] power
[14:45] you go down there and deliver my people
[14:48] they just stick in Your Hands there's a
[14:50] witness of course you've seen a miracle
[14:52] done by just like David was a slingshot
[14:55] harnessed himself and he went down
[14:57] finally God had a man that was subject
[15:02] to inquiries to him and he could not
[15:05] move until the word of God moved amen if
[15:09] people just do that today then he was
[15:11] his prisoners
[15:15] with God is always yourself in a bond of
[15:19] love to God
[15:21] just like Paul both of us trained the
[15:24] same way
[15:25] what was his traditional to deliver the
[15:27] children of Israel but military life
[15:29] poetry to take it out of the hands let
[15:33] them freeze by great ecclesiastical
[15:36] force in the world that day great
[15:38] schools of training come up on her
[15:40] dominion and both of them went to the
[15:42] desert
[15:42] come back different man Brothers
[15:57] man
[16:01] exactly right coming for an Olympic
[16:04] there was went to the desert left their
[16:06] homes and went to the desert to find out
[16:09] Lester peoples and everything to find
[16:11] the will of God
[16:12] they see they were trained in one way
[16:15] God changed them to another and they had
[16:17] become a complete prisoner to not act in
[16:20] the way that they wanted to act but
[16:21] acting the way that God wanted them to
[16:23] act
[16:24] he's the same yesterday today and
[16:26] forever have we got another 10 this
[16:29] Saturday my real quick they get to
[16:31] another character I see one before me
[16:34] now his name is Joseph
[16:37] he was an elected son
[16:40] he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ
[16:44] he was born in the prophet he is a
[16:46] prophet also see and now he could see
[16:50] vision and when he's the other little
[16:52] boy he saw a vision of himself sitting
[16:55] on the throne and his brothers died
[17:00] but why
[17:01] he felt like he's a great guy see and
[17:05] all of the bloody God has to do
[17:07] he done the same thing that he did to
[17:10] the rest of them because Moses was a
[17:13] deliverer Paul was to deliver and now
[17:16] Joseph was to deliver he saved his
[17:18] people from the dead
[17:20] what did God have to do James had he
[17:22] been prison amen amen straight to the
[17:25] prison
[17:27] yes sir
[17:28] remember he was told by his brother to
[17:31] an Egyptian and they stoled him to
[17:33] potipher and a piper uh gave him a
[17:36] little bit of Liberty and uh first thing
[17:39] you know that was taken from him and
[17:41] there is set in the prison crying cry
[17:45] crying God had this prison now what is
[17:48] it but all the time I believe he in that
[17:51] prison he could remember that the vision
[17:54] thing
[17:58] because he knew that his gifts come from
[18:01] God and he knews that it was hard to
[18:03] come to pass if we could only keep that
[18:05] in our mind
[18:07] according to the word of God this is the
[18:10] slang says he's going to have a church
[18:12] going to have a people and these things
[18:15] that he promised he's going to do
[18:18] amen and we're living in the town
[18:30] [Music]
[18:32] I want to be shutting with God
[18:35] now that's where I thought about this
[18:37] is being shut in with God
[18:40] nothing else in your holy mood when God
[18:43] says move you only do is stop saying
[18:46] then you're shutting with God now
[18:48] remember you're mistaken he also became
[18:52] a total failure to himself
[18:55] all that he knew all that he understood
[18:58] and everything he become a total failure
[19:01] it didn't work
[19:02] he was put under a situation
[19:05] the whole earth that nobody would listen
[19:08] to and he was a prisoner
[19:11] see he was tucked into a situation
[19:15] that unbelievers would not believe me
[19:21] his ministry
[19:23] this is not a fact
[19:26] the people from their heads
[19:29] they wouldn't pay attention to him in
[19:31] prison
[19:34] what's good for these things you do
[19:36] you might stand to the prison bars and
[19:38] preach to him and walk on down the
[19:40] street see but he can't a prisoner
[19:43] God cat in the pleasure until he is
[19:50] good
[19:51] Hallelujah
[19:54] finally
[19:56] God can't do it in his presence like
[19:59] Paul
[20:02] he came to him and he used the gift that
[20:06] he had given to get him out of there and
[20:09] he brought him from his prisons
[20:13] what did he do
[20:14] as soon as he raised on his prison he
[20:18] was given power
[20:20] Amen brother King his King amen they
[20:24] settled the silence that he was honored
[20:27] he was brought from the prison house and
[20:30] give his power for whatever he says
[20:36] he
[20:38] [Music]
[20:46] [Music]
[20:54] [Music]
[21:01] thank you
[21:02] and when it comes from his prison house
[21:06] and become a prisoner of the word of God
[21:09] that he can only say what God said he is
[21:12] about to say
[21:13] then God moved through
[21:16] here
[21:18] that Moses have power
[21:21] Divine favorites
[21:22] [Music]
[21:25] yeah 56 this mountain be moving
[21:28] Hallelujah
[21:30] he has power to bind Heroes
[21:34] well there was deacons of freshers
[21:37] [Applause]
[21:39] whatever you want
[21:41] to find you
[21:47] everybody's own words his own pleasure
[21:49] yeah
[21:50] and boys are gone Ally
[21:56] oh
[21:58] I just got about three more minutes I
[21:59] keep my words
[22:01] now
[22:03] we find out
[22:05] that he he become a prisoner to God
[22:12] and Moses the same way from a pleasure
[22:15] to his own thinking the present to God
[22:18] and when he come out he had the power of
[22:21] God and when he become Paul when they've
[22:24] all taken of Moses he was surrendered it
[22:26] and script of it he become a prisoner to
[22:30] Christ's word could only move wherever
[22:32] he said Christ he esteemed the reports
[22:35] of Christ greater Treasures of that of
[22:36] Egypt so he wants a prisoner of Christ
[22:38] just like Paula remember all three of
[22:42] them were Prophets
[22:44] yeah see and they had to be fixed of
[22:48] their own thinking in order to become a
[22:50] prisoner to the will and the ways of God
[22:53] now we remember it now
[22:56] that he has power to buy that his own
[22:58] words he had power to lose at his own
[23:00] words
[23:01] he could say I lose you
[23:05] in the name of my place
[23:08] hey man
[23:12] May Joseph his son
[23:16] amen Christ
[23:19] make tears prisoners of love his son
[23:22] amen amen and he gives them power
[23:27] the same thing here Saint John's 14 12.
[23:31] he doesn't believeth on me the Western I
[23:34] do shall he do also even more than
[23:37] initial he do
[23:39] now the prisoner of the Lord of Christ
[23:42] becomes empowered by his King who is
[23:45] Christ
[23:46] amen and very I say unto you if you say
[23:50] to this mountain be moved and don't
[23:51] doubt in your heart but believe that
[23:52] what you said will come to pass you have
[23:54] what you said
[23:55] amen
[23:58] [Music]
[24:03] [Music]
[24:13] ity
[24:15] yet Power Glory notice before he cannot
[24:19] he had to be taken out in shade
[24:24] before he meet his team
[24:28] oh God sometimes take these people out
[24:30] like that it saves a few of their own
[24:33] Wills all
[24:34] kills him if he can't do this what they
[24:37] wanted to do you know what I mean
[24:39] they're not they're not Liberty do what
[24:41] they want to do before they can come
[24:43] into full power and be a loved slave to
[24:46] Christ the Earth should be shaved off
[24:48] and then presented sometimes he takes
[24:51] them to the deserts to do that
[24:52] to shave them all and then bring them
[24:55] out the anointed ones before fill the
[24:58] purpose that he's ordained them to be
[25:01] you know what I mean
[25:03] Brothers we're at the end time
[25:06] remember all other times what he's done
[25:09] he's always had to take a man and make
[25:11] him a prisoner to you for say he's owned
[25:15] he had to forsake everything that he
[25:17] knows forget all these trainees
[25:19] everything in order to know
[25:21] the will of God and to follow God he
[25:23] can't follow anything that man's got to
[25:25] do and God the same time it's too
[25:27] contrary one to another you can't be
[25:29] going east and west at the same time you
[25:30] can't be going uh right left at the same
[25:33] time you can't be doing right and we're
[25:34] always at the same time you can't be
[25:35] falling man in God's at the same time
[25:37] no sir you're either following God or
[25:40] falling man
[25:41] now then if you are following God and
[25:44] have submitted yourself to God then you
[25:48] become a prisoner to that dog to that
[25:51] word to that will no matter what
[25:53] anything else that you become a pleasure
[25:55] to it listen
[25:57] we're at the end time
