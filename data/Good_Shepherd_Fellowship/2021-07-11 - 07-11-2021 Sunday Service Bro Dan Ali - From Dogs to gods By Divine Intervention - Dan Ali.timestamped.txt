[36:46] and brother linwell see ya
[36:50] amen so you are all warmly welcome to
[36:55] the house of god
[36:58] there are no visitors in our gates so
[37:01] don't consider yourself a visitor
[37:03] just enjoy the lord praise be to god
[37:08] now brother one had something to read
[37:11] originally before he traveled
[37:14] and um he called this morning
[37:17] and um he asked does
[37:21] print copies of it after church
[37:25] uh brother jordan has printed a lot of
[37:27] copies
[37:28] so there is a copy for everyone but then
[37:31] there is one here
[37:33] he wants us to read and
[37:35] [Music]
[37:37] do you do you fear cancer and i s
[37:41] by miss rosella griffith
[37:44] of juliet illinois and it was on this
[37:48] day july 11th
[37:50] that the prophet of god prayed for this
[37:52] sister
[37:54] and now he wants us to read
[37:57] if i'm going to read this it will take
[37:59] time so i have
[38:01] i have a lawyer behind there brother
[38:04] jordan do you mind coming around
[38:09] praise the lord amen
[38:16] okay
[38:22] all right this is just a testimony and
[38:25] i'll give you a quick
[38:25] background so you know what we're
[38:27] reading of a sister who
[38:29] was diagnosed as an alcoholic that
[38:31] brother branham prayed for
[38:33] and the day she was prayed for was june
[38:35] 11th
[38:37] let me see i know the date is on here
[38:43] 1952 and so brother one
[38:46] thought it would be advantageous to us
[38:50] to go ahead and bring that up kind of as
[38:53] a memorial of what god has done in our
[38:55] time in our age
[38:57] or something that we can relate to that
[38:59] god is still able to do today
[39:01] so there's a little bit of a long
[39:02] reading so um i'll try to read it
[39:05] quickly but not so quick that you can't
[39:07] understand what i'm saying
[39:08] and we'll go through it and then i'll
[39:10] just make a comment or two at the end
[39:12] but i thought that song here that we
[39:14] were singing right here
[39:16] at the end of song service was so
[39:17] applicable that there's a fountain
[39:19] filled with blood and whatever your
[39:21] issue or a trial
[39:22] whatever you're going through sickness
[39:26] whatever your temptation there is a
[39:28] fountain filled with blood
[39:30] that you can plunge beneath this morning
[39:32] that wipes every sin away
[39:35] all right let's go ahead and read it and
[39:37] brother dan already read the title this
[39:39] was a
[39:40] miss rosalia griffith or as we would say
[39:43] a
[39:43] sister rosalia griffith of julia
[39:45] illinois
[39:47] and this is her testimony and it says
[39:49] i'd like to give my testimony here
[39:52] for jesus said where jesus said go
[39:56] and be a witness unto me and we overcome
[39:59] by the blood of the lamb
[40:00] and by the word of our testimony i could
[40:03] not give a testimony like this
[40:05] if i were my in my old self but i'm not
[40:08] in myself i am in christ jesus
[40:12] i am an only child and as long as i can
[40:14] remember i kept looking for something to
[40:16] make me happy
[40:18] i kept seeking something i knew not what
[40:21] i was seeking peace
[40:22] and joy i had to play with the other
[40:24] children in the neighborhood and it
[40:26] seemed i never fit in
[40:28] i was sent as a child to the methodist
[40:30] church in our small town in southern
[40:32] illinois
[40:33] when i was six years old i went with my
[40:36] grandmother to a revival and i went down
[40:38] the sawdust trail to give my heart to
[40:40] jesus
[40:41] but nobody helped me i'm afraid i did
[40:44] not live for him
[40:45] i went to sunday school church and in
[40:48] summer i went to youth camp
[40:50] from our church but through all this i
[40:53] did not know jesus christ as my savior
[40:55] i knew stories about jesus but i did not
[40:58] really know him at this time
[41:01] then we moved to another city and after
[41:04] graduation from high school i started
[41:06] working in an office
[41:08] six and seven days a week three to 11 pm
[41:11] shift so when the girls did have an
[41:14] evening off we would go out together
[41:16] many times we would go into chicago we
[41:18] thought we were having fun
[41:20] we would dance and needless to say we
[41:22] would have a few drinks
[41:24] they could stop when they wanted to stop
[41:26] drinking but i could not
[41:28] for i'd order extra drinks being away
[41:31] ahead of them
[41:32] i was not immoral but god said one sin
[41:35] is as great as another in his eyes i
[41:38] resented the fact that i was compelled
[41:40] to do something beyond my own will
[41:43] in the year ninth of 1949 i knew i was a
[41:46] confirmed alcoholic i did not want to
[41:48] admit it
[41:49] even to myself i was at the bottom of
[41:52] the ladder and seemed like there was no
[41:54] hope for me
[41:55] my parents wanted to help me but they
[41:58] didn't know how to cope with me for
[41:59] neither of them drank
[42:01] in my heart i wanted to be free and i
[42:04] tried everything to get my mind off
[42:06] drinking
[42:07] but it did not take the habit away
[42:11] finally i decided i would try going to
[42:14] alcoholics anonymous thinking they might
[42:16] help me
[42:18] i was really happy in this organization
[42:20] although i stayed sober for nine months
[42:22] through going to their meetings i prayed
[42:25] every day at the
[42:26] bottom of my bed for god to keep me
[42:28] sober
[42:29] he did keep me sober but i was not happy
[42:32] or free
[42:33] before i joined alcoholics anonymous i
[42:35] was in and out of hospitals until they
[42:37] got tired of seeing me come in
[42:39] i went to an alcoholic hospital in
[42:41] chicago where it cost
[42:43] and fifty dollars for five days and my
[42:46] folks there were not wealthy people
[42:49] for with hospitals and doctors bills
[42:52] mounting up at this period in my life
[42:54] i was so weak losing weight and just
[42:57] miserable
[42:58] five doctors had given me up completely
[43:01] one doctor said in six months time i'd
[43:04] be in the mental institution
[43:06] neighbors had given me up ministers
[43:09] didn't know what to do
[43:10] one minister came out and tried to
[43:12] reason with me over the scriptures
[43:14] what i needed was someone who could do
[43:16] like the disciples did
[43:18] command the demon of alcohol to leave in
[43:20] the name of jesus christ
[43:22] my dad told my mother to give up praying
[43:25] for me
[43:26] for i'd never change but she did not
[43:28] listen to him for she said
[43:30] maybe i wouldn't change but she knew god
[43:33] was able to change me
[43:36] mother bought me a fur coat thinking
[43:39] if i fell in the cold i'd not freeze i
[43:42] split the pockets of the coat and put
[43:43] bottles all around in the lining of the
[43:45] coat
[43:46] i'm so glad my mother stood by me and
[43:49] clung to god's word
[43:50] when all said i could not be different
[43:54] even though i disgraced her and she did
[43:57] not understand why i did as i did
[43:59] she still stood with me when i lifted a
[44:01] cup or a glass to drink out of it i
[44:04] shook
[44:04] so i had to lap it up like a little dog
[44:09] i turned catholic looking for peace of
[44:11] mind
[44:12] even though i did not believe in it they
[44:15] told me i needed help
[44:17] but did not forward me to christ
[44:20] all in all everyone but my mother on
[44:22] earth had given
[44:23] me up as hopeless when i was at the
[44:26] worst i ever was
[44:28] my mother saw me in a vision as being
[44:31] saved
[44:32] behind a pulpit unzipping a bible
[44:35] she believed god because god showed her
[44:37] in a vision
[44:38] rather than believe being five earthly
[44:41] doctors
[44:42] later this vision was fulfilled when i
[44:44] was at the worst
[44:46] in the end a doctor waited all night
[44:49] long at the foot of my bed for me to
[44:51] draw my last breath
[44:53] i'm so glad that there was a greater
[44:55] doctor than that doctor standing there
[44:58] knowing i'd not die but live to glorify
[45:01] his name
[45:02] jesus said the thief cometh to seek and
[45:05] devour
[45:06] and destroy but i am come that you may
[45:09] have life
[45:10] and have it more abundantly
[45:13] groping for a ray of light when life was
[45:16] the darkest
[45:17] some people told me of a meeting in
[45:19] hammond indiana
[45:21] where a prophet of god reverend william
[45:24] branham
[45:25] was praying for the sick where the lame
[45:27] walked and the blind
[45:28] he were healed cancers healed miracles
[45:32] were done in the name of christ
[45:34] i clung to these words for i thought
[45:37] if these people could be healed surely
[45:40] then
[45:40] i could be healed too we went to the
[45:43] meeting
[45:43] the third day after i was told about the
[45:46] meeting
[45:47] my mother her friend and i went to the
[45:48] civic center that day on july 11
[45:52] 1952 where
[45:55] the meeting was being held i saw the
[45:57] people singing
[45:58] and praise god i thought they surely
[46:01] were happy
[46:02] i still looked out the corner of my
[46:04] glasses to see how they were acting
[46:06] and thought i'll go along with them if i
[46:08] could find help
[46:10] later i was to find out their
[46:14] find out here is really joy in serving
[46:17] jesus christ
[46:19] no wonder they were so happy we came
[46:21] back after the afternoon meeting
[46:23] and i got a prayer card one thing i
[46:25] remember of the meeting was how they
[46:27] stressed
[46:28] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[46:31] and forever
[46:32] i did not know one scripture for healing
[46:35] being brought up in the meth
[46:37] modernist church only i thought if god
[46:40] made the universe and all its wonders
[46:43] and made me then it would be a small
[46:45] thing for him to heal my body
[46:48] i bowed my head and asked god if it were
[46:51] his will to heal me
[46:53] to find a way that is all i said
[46:56] i did not know the bible says by his
[46:58] stripes we are healed
[47:00] i got a prayer card brother branham came
[47:03] and preached
[47:04] after the preaching service brother
[47:05] branham called j25 through j50
[47:08] prayer cards mine was third in line j27
[47:12] so i went knowing if i stood
[47:15] before this man of god i'd be healed
[47:20] when i came into the line brother
[47:21] branham said he saw me
[47:23] in darkness he said do you believe in
[47:26] god's prophet
[47:27] i said yes brother branham said if god
[47:30] reveals to me what's the matter with you
[47:33] and if jesus heals you will you serve
[47:36] jesus the rest of your life i said yes
[47:40] brother branham told the audience to bow
[47:42] their head and placed his hand
[47:44] on my head and rebuked the devil of
[47:47] alcohol from my life in the name of the
[47:50] lord jesus christ
[47:52] and i left the platform free i felt so
[47:55] wonderful to know
[47:57] for the first time in my life i was free
[48:00] who the son sets free is free indeed
[48:04] jesus christ healed my body in a matter
[48:06] of seconds
[48:07] where to everyone else i was a problem
[48:10] praise his holy name
[48:12] i was having a meeting all my own when i
[48:14] left that platform my
[48:16] how glad i was for i had something i
[48:19] longed for
[48:20] all my life in christ
[48:23] a lady came to me and said she felt so
[48:26] sorry for me
[48:27] and i told her she didn't have to for
[48:30] jesus
[48:30] had healed my body and i was fine
[48:34] she asked me if i could call her
[48:35] daughter i asked her
[48:37] three times what was wrong with her she
[48:39] said she was a confirmed dope addict
[48:41] the fbi could not even find her for a
[48:44] matter of months
[48:45] and she had come home now she was a
[48:48] dancer with fred
[48:49] a stare and needed help
[48:52] well she gave me her phone number and
[48:54] told me to call her collect
[48:56] i had to for i had just lost a good job
[49:00] people told me not to call her also my
[49:03] mother
[49:03] told me not to call her and get mixed up
[49:06] again
[49:07] well that night going home from hammond
[49:09] indiana
[49:10] after just being healed we stopped for
[49:13] coffee or ice cream
[49:15] don't ask me what i ate for i don't
[49:16] remember i was too thrilled
[49:19] that night came
[49:25] that night came to
[49:29] that night i came to god asking him to
[49:31] show me i was saved
[49:33] for i knew i was healed i asked god to
[49:35] forgive my every sin i had ever
[49:37] committed against him
[49:39] for i was sorry i waited for about 10
[49:42] minutes lying there on my bed with my
[49:44] arms outstretched
[49:45] my very soul left my body went up to the
[49:48] ceiling and i was afraid i called my
[49:50] mother and she said i was just saved
[49:52] i was so glad the next morning being
[49:55] saved
[49:57] and healed i got up and ate and told my
[49:59] mother i felt a strong urge to call that
[50:01] girl
[50:02] i went to the phone and talked 45
[50:03] minutes to this girl
[50:05] she found every excuse not to go to the
[50:07] meeting
[50:08] then she asked me how i knew i was
[50:10] healed i told her we had tried
[50:12] everything
[50:13] else so let's try the lord jesus
[50:16] i went to the meeting the next day after
[50:18] i was saved and healed
[50:20] and met the girl first time i had ever
[50:22] seen her in my life
[50:24] she got a prayer card and her number was
[50:26] called she asked me if i would go with
[50:28] her in the line
[50:29] i did and she asked me what she should
[50:32] do
[50:33] i told her to forget everything else and
[50:35] just believe jesus
[50:37] imagine i was just saved and healed the
[50:39] night before myself
[50:41] and was acting like i knew what it was
[50:43] all about
[50:44] she was last in line and brother branham
[50:46] prayed for her
[50:47] jesus healed her and how happy we both
[50:51] are when we saw one another tears
[50:53] running down our cheeks
[50:55] knowing it was the power of god that set
[50:57] us free
[50:58] that's right how wonderful to serve
[51:00] christ that's right
[51:01] the lord is wonderful jesus
[51:04] gave me a good job after prayer and i'd
[51:07] pray for a raise and i'd get them too
[51:09] there's nothing too hard for god amen
[51:12] one week after i was saved and healed i
[51:15] went to the meeting
[51:16] i went every day after that until the
[51:18] end of the meeting
[51:19] a man went with us that was an alcoholic
[51:22] and also my mother's
[51:24] my mother and dad after brother branham
[51:27] had preached he called
[51:28] for the prayer cards my dad had prayer
[51:31] card
[51:31] r 60 too large a number to be called
[51:36] so i bowed my head and prayed i asked
[51:39] god to heal
[51:40] the alcoholic man like he did me
[51:43] also to heal my daddy and save him
[51:46] brother branham turned around and said
[51:48] the girl up in the balcony was healed a
[51:50] week ago of the same thing as you are

[51:53] she is praying for you and also she is
[51:56] praying for someone else
[51:57] it is her dad have him stand up you put
[52:00] your hand
[52:00] on his head and have him accept his
[52:02] hearing and salvation

[52:42] behold all things are become new let me
[52:46] say one thing i've never craved drink
[52:48] since

[52:58] souls to christ also in skid row
[53:01] i go to small churches in large numbers
[53:04] large churches anywhere i can
[53:06] testify for christ for he has done so
[53:09] much for me
[53:10] i could never thank him enough the bible
[53:13] says
[53:14] he that heareth my words and believeth
[53:16] on him that sent me
[53:17] hath eternal life and that shall not
[53:20] come into condemnation
[53:22] but is passed from death unto life i
[53:25] could not witness to people like i do
[53:27] now
[53:28] if it if i were in my old self for i
[53:31] would be ashamed
[53:32] but i am not in myself any longer i am
[53:34] in christ jesus
[53:36] jesus said because i live you shall live
[53:40] also
[53:41] i am so glad for a christian mother
[53:44] that would not give up even though she
[53:46] was made fun of
[53:48] in our neighborhood etc but now
[53:51] in our home but now our home is a happy
[53:54] place
[53:55] i'm so glad that jesus said i am come to
[53:57] set the captive free
[53:59] i truly thank god for his mercy and love
[54:02] to me
[54:03] god heard my mother's prayers saw my
[54:06] honest heart
[54:07] wanting to be free and sent his prophet
[54:10] the reverend william branham to hammond
[54:12] indiana
[54:13] to bring christ to my life truly i have
[54:16] the greatest christian respect for
[54:18] brother branham
[54:19] and truly he is the prophet of god i am
[54:22] so glad that jesus saw me
[54:24] and understood and knew i wanted to be
[54:27] free
[54:28] praise his name
[54:32] here we stand once again on july the
[54:34] 11th
[54:36] and his word is still the same and we're
[54:39] still
[54:40] pushing jesus christ the same yesterday
[54:43] today and forever
[54:45] so whether it's something you're
[54:46] struggling with whether it's someone
[54:48] you know a friend a family member
[54:52] be like this mother who never gave up
[54:55] the doctors gave up the father gave up
[54:58] everyone around her gave up
[55:00] and even when you see someone you don't
[55:03] understand
[55:04] how they could be living the way they're
[55:05] living or going through what they're
[55:07] going through
[55:08] and it seems to you like they don't even
[55:09] want help
[55:11] but god knows their heart and as they
[55:14] physically can be seen running away god
[55:17] is reaching out to their heart
[55:19] bringing them back stay in prayer stay
[55:21] praying
[55:22] the god will reach them where they're at
[55:25] because god has a reason a purpose
[55:27] because look at this lady here she was
[55:30] an alcoholic
[55:31] and within 24 hours of being delivered
[55:34] she'd already taken her testimonies to
[55:37] someone else and they were delivered
[55:39] and within one week's time another
[55:41] alcoholic was delivered and her father
[55:43] was healed all on off of her testimony
[55:46] so let us take our testimonies and never
[55:49] let them go but move forward in jesus
[55:51] christ
[55:52] and continue to express it to people you
[55:54] can be set free because he's still the
[55:56] same
[55:57] yesterday today and forever i just have
[56:00] about
[56:00] 20 copies here anyone who wants one can
[56:02] have one take it with you put it in your
[56:04] bible

[59:29] be to god amen from dogs
[59:33] to girls by divine intervention

[59:46] areas
[59:47] in lowercase gos
[59:52] praise be to god
[59:56] what a wonderful god we serve
[1:00:00] i am here this morning to tell you how
[1:00:03] much
[1:00:04] of a dog satan is
[1:00:07] and how much of a god the god we serve
[1:00:11] is
[1:00:13] and if you have not made up your mind
[1:00:15] and you are still hopping between two
[1:00:16] opinions
[1:00:18] today is a good day to decide where you
[1:00:21] stand
[1:00:23] today is a day to flee from the devil's
[1:00:26] camp
[1:00:28] under the wings of the most high god
[1:00:32] and to be part of the economy of god
[1:00:36] praise be to god today is a good day to
[1:00:40] get under his wings
[1:00:42] if you want to be a part
[1:00:45] of what he is doing
[1:00:50] there was this day
[1:00:53] i came down to the break room i was at
[1:00:55] work
[1:00:56] then i sat behind my computer i mean
[1:01:00] it's a computer everybody uses in the
[1:01:02] office i sat down behind one
[1:01:04] and i said i said satan you are a dog
[1:01:09] and i said it again i said satan
[1:01:12] i say you are a dog
[1:01:15] and when i said it i said it to me an
[1:01:18] insult
[1:01:19] and i will insult satan any day of the
[1:01:22] week
[1:01:24] any hour of the day but then after i
[1:01:28] said that
[1:01:29] it was like a voice spoke to me that you
[1:01:32] didn't insult him
[1:01:35] then i sat down i said but what did i do
[1:01:41] praise be to god that that is who he
[1:01:44] really is
[1:01:46] that is who he is i said oh
[1:01:50] then my mind started spinning
[1:01:53] and that was how i came
[1:01:57] to this story now when you hear somebody
[1:02:01] say satan is a dog you say oh
[1:02:03] it's like this brother he's finished
[1:02:04] with his life and he's looking for
[1:02:06] trouble for us
[1:02:09] get ready to fight if you are not
[1:02:12] fighting now then there is a problem
[1:02:13] somehow
[1:02:15] we are ought to be fighting
[1:02:18] in one way or the other you are fighting
[1:02:21] praise be to god you are either fighting
[1:02:25] for god or you are fighting against god
[1:02:28] if you are not guarding with him you are
[1:02:30] scattering
[1:02:31] if you are not fighting for god you are
[1:02:33] fighting against god
[1:02:35] if you are not for god you are against
[1:02:37] god
[1:02:38] if you are not a friend to god you are
[1:02:39] an enemy praise be to god
[1:02:42] so in one way or the other we are all
[1:02:44] fighting
[1:02:45] may praise be to god look
[1:02:48] if it was before you accepted christ
[1:02:52] i would say be careful
[1:02:57] but if it is after you have accepted
[1:03:00] christ
[1:03:01] i will tell you there is nothing to be
[1:03:02] careful about
[1:03:05] like the three hebrew children the said
[1:03:07] king we are not
[1:03:09] careful to answer you in this matter our
[1:03:11] god is able to deliver
[1:03:13] us and if he is not able we are not
[1:03:16] going to bow we are ready to die
[1:03:18] praise be to god and i don't care what
[1:03:21] it is that you are going through
[1:03:22] when the enemy comes against you and you
[1:03:24] share the name jesus
[1:03:26] he will show up praise be to god and
[1:03:29] whenever god shows up
[1:03:31] the devil freezes up in his tracks
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:35] praise be to god the lord our god is our
[1:03:39] life
[1:03:39] we are serving a living god how can you
[1:03:42] serve god and fear satan
[1:03:45] my goodness over our dead body
[1:03:49] you can't serve god and have the fear of
[1:03:53] god in your heart
[1:03:54] and fear satan at the same time it
[1:03:57] doesn't happen
[1:04:02] like the disciples when they were
[1:04:03] crossing the sea with the lord jesus
[1:04:05] behind the boat sleeping and there was a
[1:04:07] storm
[1:04:08] the devil wanted to capsize us that the
[1:04:10] boat
[1:04:12] oh there were experienced fishermen on
[1:04:14] that boat
[1:04:16] peter was an experience he was not a he
[1:04:18] was not a novice
[1:04:19] he was a veteran and he thought he could
[1:04:22] calm the boat
[1:04:24] the harder he tried the harder he failed
[1:04:27] until they remembered that jesus was
[1:04:29] behind there and they turned to him
[1:04:32] master cares doubt that now we perish
[1:04:35] and when he rose up he rebuked the storm
[1:04:38] and they said what manner of man is this
[1:04:41] praise be to god
[1:04:43] in the midst of the storm when he shows
[1:04:46] up
[1:04:47] the devil freezes in his truck so
[1:04:50] if there was a time to look for trouble
[1:04:53] it is now
[1:04:54] and when you go looking for trouble
[1:04:56] don't look for the small ones
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:01] praise be to god remember that the
[1:05:05] battle is not your battle
[1:05:06] it is the lost battle look for the big
[1:05:09] ones
[1:05:10] because you know he is there praise be
[1:05:13] to god
[1:05:16] from dogs to gods
[1:05:20] by divine intervention
[1:05:24] praise be to god and remember that we
[1:05:27] are fighting a defeated foe
[1:05:29] he's been defeated already
[1:05:32] all we have to do is charge on the enemy
[1:05:36] when david took down goliath
[1:05:40] all those people that were behind and
[1:05:42] was so scared to death
[1:05:44] when they saw goliath what did they have
[1:05:45] to do they just had to charge up on the
[1:05:47] enemy
[1:05:49] the devil says that god says the devil
[1:05:51] belongs under our feet
[1:05:54] that is why he belongs we give the devil
[1:05:57] too much respect
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] you give him one yard he will take 10
[1:06:04] years
[1:06:05] and before you realize he has taken a
[1:06:07] mile
[1:06:09] don't give him any room he doesn't
[1:06:12] deserve it
[1:06:14] he is under our feet and if the devil
[1:06:18] is under our feet and he is not giving
[1:06:20] up
[1:06:21] why should you that is winning why
[1:06:23] should you give up
[1:06:26] he is under your feet and he has not
[1:06:29] given up
[1:06:30] why should you give up
[1:06:36] praise be to god this
[1:06:40] scripture we just read
[1:06:44] it is not meat to take the children's
[1:06:48] bread
[1:06:49] and cast it to dogs
[1:06:54] remember
[1:06:58] god is everything satan is not
[1:07:06] god is light satan is darkness
[1:07:12] god is peace satan is war
[1:07:16] god is love satan is hate
[1:07:20] god is joy
[1:07:23] what will be the opposite of joy
[1:07:27] satan is sorrow
[1:07:30] if i should ask you what is the opposite
[1:07:32] of god everybody who says satan which is
[1:07:35] correct
[1:07:38] but today i want to say that the
[1:07:39] opposite of god is dog and that is who
[1:07:42] he really is
[1:07:44] praise be to god
[1:07:49] we all know the story about this
[1:07:51] television woman
[1:07:52] whose daughter was versed with an evil
[1:07:54] spirit she
[1:07:56] may have tried everything she knew and
[1:07:58] nothing was working
[1:08:00] and when she heard the lord jesus was
[1:08:03] around the course
[1:08:04] then she went because she knew that if
[1:08:06] she could talk to him
[1:08:08] something would change and when he got
[1:08:11] there
[1:08:12] and she cried out son of david son of
[1:08:16] david
[1:08:17] my daughter is vice with a demon i need
[1:08:20] help
[1:08:21] crying out and the lord jesus would not
[1:08:23] even mind her
[1:08:26] and she was following and crying and
[1:08:28] shouting
[1:08:31] tell the disciples god vexed and said
[1:08:34] why don't you send this woman away
[1:08:37] and the lord jesus turned to her and
[1:08:40] said i was not sent
[1:08:41] but unto the lost sheep
[1:08:44] of the children of israel and you would
[1:08:48] think that was going to send the woman
[1:08:49] parking
[1:08:50] that was not enough she came
[1:08:54] and fell at his feet and worshipped him
[1:08:58] crying that helped me i need help
[1:09:01] for my daughter and i said that was not
[1:09:05] enough
[1:09:06] jesus told her i cannot take the
[1:09:08] children's bread
[1:09:09] and cast it to dogs that was a hard
[1:09:13] statement
[1:09:13] isn't it and you would think that was
[1:09:17] going to stop her
[1:09:19] but she said after fact
[1:09:22] she didn't fight with that statement she
[1:09:25] didn't have to struggle with it
[1:09:27] she said after a fact that is true
[1:09:30] how be it the dogs feed on the cramps
[1:09:35] that fall from the master's table praise
[1:09:38] be to god
[1:09:39] and the lord jesus said woman great is
[1:09:42] thy faith
[1:09:44] and let what you look at your will i
[1:09:46] mean
[1:09:47] whatever you are asking for be gutted
[1:09:49] unto you and right that moment
[1:09:51] her daughter got healed praise be to god
[1:09:55] a lot of the times we don't see the hand
[1:09:58] of god
[1:09:58] because we are rebellious to the world
[1:10:03] when the world comes to us the world
[1:10:06] that is coming to perform in us
[1:10:08] the world that is coming to deliver us
[1:10:10] the world that is coming to break those
[1:10:12] chains
[1:10:13] the world is coming to change our nature
[1:10:15] we fight against that word
[1:10:18] and once you fight against it
[1:10:21] you defeat the purpose of god in your
[1:10:25] life
[1:10:27] she didn't fight it she said yes it is
[1:10:31] true
[1:10:32] you can't give it to dogs you are right
[1:10:35] you can't give it to dogs yes there is
[1:10:39] nothing wrong with you
[1:10:39] you can't give back you know what the
[1:10:41] dogs
[1:10:43] feed from the crowns
[1:10:47] praise be to god now
[1:10:51] when i started looking at this
[1:10:55] a lot of the times you look at it and
[1:10:57] say no it was an insult
[1:10:59] now i want to be very careful in the
[1:11:01] words i choose here
[1:11:03] that to some extent
[1:11:08] it was an insult but to a
[1:11:12] greater extent it was not an
[1:11:15] insult praise be to god
[1:11:19] now just imagine that i'm a poor man
[1:11:23] there is nobody poor here there is
[1:11:26] nobody poor
[1:11:27] you may be behind your bills uh whatever
[1:11:30] you may be going through financially
[1:11:32] it doesn't mean you are poor we are rich
[1:11:34] in christ
[1:11:35] praise be to god but just imagine that
[1:11:38] maybe i
[1:11:39] am poor and now you are taking care of
[1:11:42] me
[1:11:43] you are feeding me every morning every
[1:11:45] afternoon
[1:11:46] every evening you clothed me you have
[1:11:49] sheltered me
[1:11:50] and everybody in the neighborhood knows
[1:11:53] that this is what is going on
[1:11:55] in other words it is no secret
[1:11:59] there is no secret about it
[1:12:02] i go to your house every day people are
[1:12:04] seeing me
[1:12:05] but just imagine one day in the midst of
[1:12:08] the same crowd
[1:12:10] who already know what is going on
[1:12:13] you can stand and say oh look at that
[1:12:16] poor man coming again
[1:12:18] oh this man is poor i have been feeding
[1:12:20] him morning afternoon evening
[1:12:22] if it was not for me this man would have
[1:12:24] died oh my goodness
[1:12:26] i believe i am going to lose appetite
[1:12:28] right away
[1:12:31] praise be to god i don't think i even
[1:12:34] want the food anymore
[1:12:37] i'm going to feel so belittled
[1:12:41] so dejected so insulted
[1:12:45] but people already know about it
[1:12:48] but for the fact that you can just
[1:12:52] talk about it in the way you didn't it
[1:12:54] just kills
[1:12:55] my spirit so yes
[1:12:59] the woman knew she was a dog but for the
[1:13:02] lord jesus to tell her
[1:13:04] we can't take the children's bread and
[1:13:05] cast it to dogs oh that was a hard
[1:13:07] statement
[1:13:09] and she had a right attitude
[1:13:12] praise be to god and the
[1:13:15] right attitude before god changes
[1:13:18] situations
[1:13:19] praise be to god yes
[1:13:24] and it was not insult because
[1:13:27] now if you look at it
[1:13:32] that statement i cannot take
[1:13:36] the children's bread if it's not meat to
[1:13:39] take the children's bread and cast it to
[1:13:41] dogs
[1:13:42] it was a figurative language
[1:13:46] with spiritual connotation
[1:13:52] amen now we all know
[1:13:59] that the children's bread it's not corn
[1:14:02] bread
[1:14:04] it's not red bread it's not potato bread
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] we know it is healing
[1:14:12] so if it was healing and not
[1:14:15] natural bread the bread would bake why
[1:14:18] should be
[1:14:18] why should the recipient the dog be a
[1:14:21] four-legged dog
[1:14:24] it was not a four-legged dog but his his
[1:14:27] two-legged counterparts
[1:14:34] praise be to god
[1:14:38] it was not a physical dog
[1:14:41] a human dog here for that matter
[1:14:47] because you don't give healing
[1:14:50] to um a german shepherd or is it
[1:14:53] cha-cha-cha-cha
[1:14:55] you know the various breeds
[1:14:58] praise be to god so it was just
[1:15:01] not a physical thing here
[1:15:10] so it was given healing
[1:15:16] not to the children to gentiles
[1:15:20] no yes sir the gentiles know
[1:15:26] that was why he could tell the woman
[1:15:29] that i am not sent
[1:15:31] but unto the lost ship of the house of
[1:15:36] israel
[1:15:38] be to god the israelites the jews had
[1:15:42] nothing to do with the gentiles so
[1:15:46] much so that even when the lord jesus
[1:15:48] himself
[1:15:49] sent the disciples to go out he told
[1:15:52] them
[1:15:53] do not go in the way of the samaritans
[1:15:55] or the gentiles
[1:15:58] that's right praise be to god
[1:16:02] so it was no insult
[1:16:05] a dog was simply somebody that was
[1:16:09] outside the economy of the almighty god
[1:16:15] that made you a dog
[1:16:18] it was no insult
[1:16:22] to be outside the economy of god
[1:16:27] worshiping idols the worshipping trees
[1:16:29] worshipping the sun
[1:16:31] the moon the sea inside of the almighty
[1:16:34] god
[1:16:36] you were a dog it was as simple as that
[1:16:42] and remember satan is a dog
[1:16:45] you don't have to be satan to be a dog
[1:16:49] all you have to do is accept his lies
[1:16:55] and walk in sin and that makes you a dog
[1:17:04] i remember we are talking about from
[1:17:07] dogs to gods
[1:17:11] by divine intervention
[1:17:15] praise be to god now
[1:17:18] i just want us to decode the time dog a
[1:17:20] little here
[1:17:22] i believe we are all on board at this
[1:17:23] point but let's just go to revelations
[1:17:25] 22 15.
[1:17:32] revelations 22 15
[1:17:36] and i read
[1:17:40] for we doubt are dogs and sorceress
[1:17:44] and humongous and murderess
[1:17:47] and idolaters and whosoever loveth
[1:17:51] and maketh a lie without
[1:17:56] praise be to god they are not talking
[1:17:59] about a natural dog here
[1:18:01] philippians 3 2. you don't have to open
[1:18:04] if you have your pen and paper you can
[1:18:06] jot it down and read that later
[1:18:08] praise be to god philippians 3 2
[1:18:12] dogs are coupled with evil workers
[1:18:16] beware of dogs beware of
[1:18:19] evil workers beware of the concession
[1:18:24] for we are the circumcision which
[1:18:27] worship
[1:18:27] god in spirit and rejoice in christ
[1:18:31] jesus
[1:18:32] and have no confidence in the flesh
[1:18:34] praise be to god
[1:18:37] so if you are not worshipping the god of
[1:18:40] their fathers
[1:18:41] the god of abraham of high school of
[1:18:43] israel you were
[1:18:45] considered a dog
[1:18:49] you were outside of the economy
[1:18:53] of the most high god prayers be to god
[1:18:56] when you go to matthew 7 6 i will not
[1:19:00] read that um
[1:19:01] maybe just take a little a small part of
[1:19:03] it
[1:19:04] that you don't give that which is holy
[1:19:07] you don't cast it to pearls or swines
[1:19:10] and the only holy thing there is is god
[1:19:16] the only holy thing there is is god
[1:19:19] and in the beginning was the word the
[1:19:22] word was with god
[1:19:23] and the word was god
[1:19:26] it's like giving the word of god
[1:19:29] which is a pale to a swine somebody that
[1:19:33] doesn't know the value of it they
[1:19:36] trampled over it and what do they do
[1:19:38] they get to you and they harm you and
[1:19:41] that is an evil doer
[1:19:43] praise be to god second peter 2
[1:19:46] 20-22 like a dog going back to his vomit
[1:19:52] and simply talking about an evil doer
[1:19:55] going back to their evil ways
[1:20:00] praise be to god now i believe
[1:20:03] that the encounter that goliath and
[1:20:06] david had
[1:20:08] i believe that it was one on the basis
[1:20:11] of who was a dog and who was not
[1:20:14] it was like goliath pronounced judgment
[1:20:17] on himself
[1:20:19] when he looked at david and said
[1:20:22] am i a dog that you come against me with
[1:20:25] steps
[1:20:28] praise be to god
[1:20:31] was goliath philistine he was a dog
[1:20:34] not just a dog but a very big one
[1:20:37] praise be to god and he had already
[1:20:41] pronounced
[1:20:42] judgment upon himself and that was why
[1:20:45] the battle
[1:20:46] ended before it even started amen
[1:20:51] praise be to god it ended
[1:20:54] before it started
[1:20:59] so in a way you are saying that no if i
[1:21:01] am a dog
[1:21:02] it is okay to come against me with this
[1:21:04] steps
[1:21:05] and he forgot that he was one
[1:21:09] press be to god
[1:21:15] from dogs to ghosts
[1:21:18] by divine intervention now
[1:21:25] in the message revelation the book of
[1:21:28] symbols
[1:21:30] 1956-0617
[1:21:32] the prophet speaking look at paul a
[1:21:36] prisoner
[1:21:37] he said the lord jesus
[1:21:41] a jew sent to the gentiles
[1:21:45] his people excommunicated him as quickly
[1:21:49] as he turned to the gentiles
[1:21:52] there is a lot of reading here i would
[1:21:54] not i would just skip
[1:21:57] i'm going to skip all that get to the
[1:21:59] very bottom of it
[1:22:00] and then we'll read a little more
[1:22:03] paul was excommunicated as soon as
[1:22:08] he got in he just went to the gentiles
[1:22:11] it was not an easy thing it was unlawful
[1:22:16] for a jew to have something to do with a
[1:22:19] gentile yes
[1:22:20] that's right so much so that
[1:22:24] when when when peter one peter
[1:22:28] went to the house of cornelius we all
[1:22:31] know the dream the vision he had
[1:22:33] all that it is going to take a lot of
[1:22:35] time so i'm just going to zero in on
[1:22:37] that the bible says
[1:22:38] while he was yet speaking the holy ghost
[1:22:42] fell upon every one of them in the house
[1:22:44] of cornelius
[1:22:46] and peter said can we forbid them water
[1:22:50] seeing that they are baptized with the
[1:22:53] holy ghost
[1:22:57] when the brethren in jerusalem heard of
[1:22:59] it the summons peter
[1:23:02] you are a traitor you have betrayed us
[1:23:06] why did you have to go to the gentiles
[1:23:08] and he had to tell them
[1:23:10] the vision he saw and how god led him
[1:23:14] and that settled the matter praise be to
[1:23:18] god
[1:23:18] and they said oh if god has done that
[1:23:22] done that among them then they have
[1:23:24] become one of us
[1:23:28] praise be to god
[1:23:31] amen thank you lord so i'm jumping over
[1:23:36] i magnify my office in the lord paul's
[1:23:39] speaking
[1:23:40] how the love of god constrained him to
[1:23:43] god
[1:23:43] among the unclean gentiles the prophet
[1:23:46] speaking
[1:23:47] who were
[1:23:50] who were considered dogs
[1:23:54] but paul said i magnify my office in the
[1:23:57] lord
[1:23:58] because he is giving me the opportunity
[1:24:01] to go minister to the dogs otherwise
[1:24:04] jesus himself regarded a gentle woman
[1:24:08] like
[1:24:09] we are as people here set a phoenician
[1:24:12] woman
[1:24:13] and said it is not meat to take the
[1:24:16] children's bread
[1:24:18] and give it to the dogs she said that's
[1:24:21] true lord
[1:24:22] but the dogs are willing to eat the
[1:24:25] scraps that falls
[1:24:26] from the master's table that got him
[1:24:30] that woke up the holy spirit knowing
[1:24:33] that
[1:24:34] soon the jews ice was going to be
[1:24:38] blinded
[1:24:39] and he was going to turn to the gentiles
[1:24:42] praise be to god it was just god
[1:24:46] in the background working this out
[1:24:51] so the gentiles being dogs
[1:24:56] was not going to last forever else will
[1:24:58] not be here
[1:25:00] talking about these good news praise be
[1:25:02] to god
[1:25:04] yes in that in the message there's a
[1:25:07] minor church age paragraph 6
[1:25:09] the prophet said and i quote
[1:25:13] you never wear a pig or
[1:25:16] dog turned into a sheep
[1:25:20] praise be to god you
[1:25:24] never wear a pig or
[1:25:27] a dog turn into a sheep
[1:25:32] so from before the foundation of the
[1:25:34] world
[1:25:36] you were a sheep to begin with
[1:25:39] we worship to begin with
[1:25:43] but do you know that if christ had not
[1:25:46] come to die for us
[1:25:48] you are going to be a sheep from the
[1:25:49] foundation of the world
[1:25:51] you will come into the world as a sheep
[1:25:53] excuse me
[1:25:54] you will leave as a sheep you will die
[1:25:56] as a sheep
[1:25:57] and you will end up in hell as a sheep
[1:26:03] you were going to end up in hell as a
[1:26:05] sheep if
[1:26:06] christ had not come to die
[1:26:10] think about it john on the island of
[1:26:13] patmos
[1:26:14] who was more of a sheep than john
[1:26:18] who was more of a sheep than john
[1:26:22] but when the angel told john
[1:26:25] asked him is any man ready
[1:26:28] to take the book and to open and to
[1:26:31] losing the seals thereof
[1:26:33] and there was nobody john said there was
[1:26:35] nobody there was no man in heaven
[1:26:37] there was some men on the earth and
[1:26:39] there was no man beneath the earth
[1:26:43] that was it was dead silence
[1:26:47] and john started to cry why was he
[1:26:50] crying
[1:26:51] was he not a sheep john was a sheep
[1:26:55] why was he crying because he knew
[1:26:58] that that book had the answer to a
[1:27:01] redemption
[1:27:03] and without anybody taking the book to
[1:27:06] open it
[1:27:06] man was doomed
[1:27:11] and when he started crying the angel
[1:27:13] told him do not cry
[1:27:16] because the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:27:18] has prevailed
[1:27:19] to take the book and to losing the cease
[1:27:21] thereof and when he
[1:27:23] turned to look right in the midst of the
[1:27:25] throne
[1:27:26] was a bloody ship as if it was slain
[1:27:30] from before the foundation of the world
[1:27:32] praise be to god but he was a sheep
[1:27:36] he knew it but he knew that without that
[1:27:39] book
[1:27:40] being opened man was doomed
[1:27:44] praise be to god amen now look at
[1:27:48] it
[1:27:52] it was by a divine hand
[1:27:56] it was by a divine hand
[1:28:01] david said in sin
[1:28:05] did my mother conceive me in iniquity
[1:28:08] was i shaping come to the world speaking
[1:28:12] lies
[1:28:14] look at it
[1:28:17] even though you were a sheep
[1:28:20] from the foundation of the world because
[1:28:24] of what happened in the garden
[1:28:27] any man that was born was burning to sin
[1:28:30] you didn't have to tell the first lie
[1:28:33] you didn't have to steal the first
[1:28:34] cookie
[1:28:35] you didn't have to do the first wrong
[1:28:38] every man that was born
[1:28:40] was born directly into sin
[1:28:44] so you were a sheep in the inside
[1:28:48] and a dog on the outside
[1:28:52] that is a mixed identity and a mixed
[1:28:55] identity would never inherit the kingdom
[1:28:57] of god
[1:28:59] a sheep in the inside a dog on the
[1:29:02] outside
[1:29:03] light in the inside darkness on the
[1:29:07] outside
[1:29:08] god in the inside satan on the outside
[1:29:12] good in the inside evil on the outside
[1:29:15] praise be to god
[1:29:18] life in the inside death on the outside
[1:29:25] that you come into this world and you
[1:29:27] are doing
[1:29:28] all the wrong things because of the
[1:29:31] nature of sin
[1:29:33] that you are carrying the redeemable you
[1:29:36] in the inside and the unredeemable you
[1:29:39] on the outside and a
[1:29:43] mixed identity can never inherit the
[1:29:45] kingdom of god
[1:29:46] and you are wondering so oh it doesn't
[1:29:48] matter i would have been a sheep in the
[1:29:50] inside
[1:29:51] if christ had not come i would have
[1:29:53] still gone to heaven you are telling
[1:29:54] lies
[1:29:55] because brother brother said that the
[1:29:57] only thing that is going to make it
[1:29:59] is the nature of god is the nature of
[1:30:02] christ
[1:30:04] now just think about it that before
[1:30:06] christ
[1:30:07] came to pay for the sins of the world
[1:30:10] and our sins for that matter
[1:30:12] god had already made a provision for the
[1:30:15] children of israel
[1:30:17] that if they committed any sin they just
[1:30:20] had to come with a sinner friend
[1:30:22] an atonement was made on their behalf
[1:30:24] and god forgave them
[1:30:27] but there was something that even though
[1:30:29] they were forgiven
[1:30:31] that never gave them a nature change
[1:30:34] they still left with the same nature
[1:30:38] that offering did not change their
[1:30:40] nature
[1:30:43] and if the nature of christ is the only
[1:30:46] thing that is going to make it
[1:30:48] then where do you stand your sins have
[1:30:51] been forgiven
[1:30:53] and you are still carrying the same old
[1:30:54] nature where do you end up
[1:30:59] where do you end up thank you
[1:31:03] praise be to god
[1:31:15] so
[1:31:19] talking about a dog
[1:31:23] and don't forget satan is a dog
[1:31:27] talking about a dog
[1:31:30] if if if the dog in america here
[1:31:34] is all you know then you have not known
[1:31:36] a dog yet
[1:31:38] praise be to god
[1:31:42] oh yes
[1:31:50] because the dogs in america
[1:31:54] they have their own police force
[1:31:58] that if you even whip your dog and your
[1:32:01] nobody hears you whipping a dog
[1:32:03] he will just call the police and the
[1:32:05] police will come and arrest you for
[1:32:07] whipping your dog
[1:32:11] they have their own court the human
[1:32:14] beings will judge you
[1:32:15] for that dog
[1:32:19] it is okay to put two men
[1:32:22] in a rink and let them box themselves to
[1:32:26] death but the first time
[1:32:29] somebody ever put two dogs together in a
[1:32:32] ring
[1:32:34] almost everybody in america wanted a
[1:32:36] piece of his meat
[1:32:37] on their dinner table
[1:32:40] i don't know he was he was uh exposed i
[1:32:43] think he was the footballer in america
[1:32:44] here
[1:32:45] how many know that story you remember he
[1:32:48] says christian okay beautiful
[1:32:51] the first time that ever happened
[1:32:56] so all if all you know is american dog
[1:32:59] which have their food
[1:33:01] prepared hygienically
[1:33:06] that you can go to the store and they
[1:33:08] have their own department
[1:33:10] with their own shelf and they have their
[1:33:13] vitamins
[1:33:14] they have their carbohydrates they have
[1:33:16] their protein
[1:33:18] and you can go and select and if the dog
[1:33:20] doesn't like it you can carry it back
[1:33:22] and change it
[1:33:24] praise be to god like you are in a
[1:33:26] chinese restaurant
[1:33:28] when you go for something it's not
[1:33:29] testing while you're going dump it and
[1:33:30] go for another one
[1:33:31] then you have not known a dog yet and in
[1:33:36] some cases
[1:33:37] that does even have more rights than
[1:33:40] some of us
[1:33:42] i wonder what is his brother talking
[1:33:43] about my brother-in-law was a truck
[1:33:46] driver
[1:33:47] i came to the united states for a
[1:33:48] driving truck i think he saw probably
[1:33:50] some eight years ago
[1:33:52] and he always used to have problems with
[1:33:54] the police
[1:33:57] they will come under under negative 10
[1:34:00] 20 degrees
[1:34:02] his truck is on and the police will come
[1:34:04] and tell him put it off
[1:34:05] you are polluting the atmosphere and he
[1:34:08] will be arguing with them
[1:34:10] until one day somebody told him justin
[1:34:13] why do you keep arguing with the police
[1:34:15] they said no should i turn it off and
[1:34:17] die he said no
[1:34:19] get a pet either put a cat or a dog in
[1:34:22] your car
[1:34:23] when the police comes and tells you put
[1:34:25] it off tell him i have a dog in the
[1:34:27] truck
[1:34:28] and that settles it
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:37] so that means that it's okay for the
[1:34:39] human being to die
[1:34:42] but it's alright for the dog to live
[1:34:46] that means that god has more rights
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:52] and that can only happen in america
[1:35:02] so if it is the american dog you know
[1:35:05] which sleeps side by side
[1:35:06] with your owners in the same bed and
[1:35:09] then you see them in front of the car
[1:35:11] with your seat belt
[1:35:14] and some even have clothes on and you
[1:35:17] see them with your bow tie small
[1:35:20] and you see a small hat
[1:35:28] and that is a dog but american dog
[1:35:32] i am not talking of the over privileged
[1:35:35] and the spoiled dogs you see in america
[1:35:38] that is not a dog i'm talking of
[1:35:41] but i'm talking of their counterparts
[1:35:43] somewhere in the world
[1:35:45] now when you even look at the the
[1:35:47] narrative
[1:35:49] that the lord jesus had with this
[1:35:51] tradition woman
[1:35:52] you can tell because listen to what the
[1:35:55] woman said that of a
[1:35:56] fact it is true how be it
[1:36:00] the dogs feed from the crumbs that fall
[1:36:04] from the masters table
[1:36:08] and i can relate to that
[1:36:11] coming from that part of africa
[1:36:14] that the only time the dogs would eat
[1:36:18] is when the master is done eating
[1:36:25] [Applause]
[1:36:28] that they will not eat the whole day
[1:36:32] but they have always been stabbed so
[1:36:34] much
[1:36:35] that they know when it's time one is
[1:36:37] meal time in the evening
[1:36:39] and they will come and let's see the
[1:36:41] master is eating
[1:36:42] looking at his father's face
[1:36:45] when the hand is going to the bowl they
[1:36:47] are looking there
[1:36:49] when the hand is going to the soup they
[1:36:50] are looking there
[1:36:52] when the hand is going back to the mouth
[1:36:53] they are looking there if you don't even
[1:36:55] take time the dog will choke you
[1:37:00] he's just sitting there waiting and when
[1:37:03] you take the meat
[1:37:04] and you eat the meat and you try the
[1:37:05] bone it's just waiting for it if you
[1:37:07] just jump and grab it
[1:37:09] when you are done eating it will come
[1:37:11] and pick
[1:37:12] what is left on the floor
[1:37:16] now i want you to look at this
[1:37:21] we are taking it physically oh
[1:37:24] transported in the spiritual
[1:37:25] life
[1:37:29] that the dogs in this era of the world
[1:37:35] even though they have an owner
[1:37:38] the owner doesn't care about them the
[1:37:40] only time he lose for them is when it is
[1:37:42] hunting time
[1:37:43] and he wants some bushmeat that is when
[1:37:45] he goes round have you seen my dog have
[1:37:47] you seen my dog
[1:37:50] apart from that he doesn't care where
[1:37:53] they sleep
[1:37:54] why they eat what they eat if the luck
[1:37:57] the dog is looking for water to drink
[1:38:00] it goes to the most unlikely places
[1:38:03] to go and drink it would eat from the
[1:38:06] dump
[1:38:10] it just roaming in the bush looking for
[1:38:13] something to pick
[1:38:16] he doesn't know what they call a car if
[1:38:19] you want to force it into a kite to bite
[1:38:20] you
[1:38:23] because all his life it has never sat in
[1:38:25] one
[1:38:27] you want to put clothes on it like we
[1:38:29] see here you will kill the dog
[1:38:32] because it will run and roll a rolling
[1:38:34] road
[1:38:37] because it wants to take it off it will
[1:38:39] end up in the street a car would knock
[1:38:41] and kill it
[1:38:44] when it's raining that is the only time
[1:38:46] they get to take their bath
[1:38:49] there is no place in the inn for them
[1:38:52] they are just outside whether rain or
[1:38:55] shine
[1:38:56] they belong there when they are sick
[1:39:00] if the master knows how to eat the dog
[1:39:03] then the dog is in trouble
[1:39:08] else they have to recover fast
[1:39:14] nobody cares about them
[1:39:17] and where i used to live in northern
[1:39:19] ghana
[1:39:20] it was a trunk road i don't want to
[1:39:23] mention that try because we are on a
[1:39:25] noun
[1:39:26] before one day i go to ghana and the
[1:39:28] brothers say you were saying this about
[1:39:30] us
[1:39:30] i'm not going to say that you know what
[1:39:34] the people who go they walk they travel
[1:39:37] far
[1:39:38] from that place of the region and they
[1:39:40] go and buy the dogs
[1:39:42] and they will chain the dogs one dog to
[1:39:45] another one dog to another
[1:39:46] and you have one person leading about
[1:39:50] 60 to 80 dogs and they are following him
[1:39:55] they will walk hundreds of miles
[1:39:59] to that place at that place in that part
[1:40:02] of the rigid is a delicacy
[1:40:05] they eat dogs it's a delicacy there
[1:40:09] and then he's transporting them and you
[1:40:12] see these dogs following
[1:40:13] and you can tell that these dogs have
[1:40:15] been starved
[1:40:17] they go to a place you'll sit down to
[1:40:19] rest more and maybe
[1:40:21] this uh master would come bring down
[1:40:24] water
[1:40:24] and they would just drink a little and
[1:40:27] maybe they'll look into his face oh
[1:40:28] this man is kind and they don't know
[1:40:31] that he's a killer
[1:40:34] they don't know that their meat has
[1:40:35] already been advertised
[1:40:37] they don't know that there is a long
[1:40:39] queue already waiting for their meat
[1:40:43] and the man will hypnotize them and drag
[1:40:46] them to the slaughter
[1:40:48] oh my goodness think about it
[1:40:52] how the devil would delude people
[1:40:58] dilute them
[1:41:02] impoverish them
[1:41:06] just think about it before you came to
[1:41:09] the knowledge of christ
[1:41:11] some of the things you did nobody cared
[1:41:13] about you
[1:41:14] they didn't care where you slept why you
[1:41:16] woke up that this you did
[1:41:18] what you didn't do nobody had time for
[1:41:20] it
[1:41:22] it is not to say that you fell from the
[1:41:25] tree no
[1:41:26] you belong to a home but spiritually
[1:41:30] you were living a dangerous con in a
[1:41:32] dangerous condition
[1:41:35] that you knew deep down yourself that if
[1:41:37] i should die today
[1:41:39] there is no hope for me nobody had to
[1:41:43] tell you
[1:41:45] you went around you belonged to gangs
[1:41:47] you went around
[1:41:48] stealing breaking into people's homes
[1:41:51] committing adultery
[1:41:52] committing fornication drinking fighting
[1:41:56] think about it all those things what is
[1:42:00] it
[1:42:01] is the devil that has deluded the people
[1:42:04] with an evil spirit and they are living
[1:42:06] that life
[1:42:09] that you know that there is no place in
[1:42:11] the inn for you
[1:42:12] all you are good for is on the outside
[1:42:16] and the devil had the people in chains
[1:42:19] put chains on your waist ankle bracelets
[1:42:22] on their foot
[1:42:24] leash on their necks and dragging them
[1:42:27] to hell
[1:42:29] and you know that you can't help this
[1:42:31] condition
[1:42:32] you can't and you are just following
[1:42:36] like that dog you are just following
[1:42:40] follow me to the slaughter
[1:42:43] and you know that it's just a matter of
[1:42:45] time
[1:42:47] you know there is no hope you have given
[1:42:50] up
[1:42:52] all you are just waiting is for your
[1:42:53] tent so you can die and go
[1:42:56] and the devil will tell you every death
[1:42:58] is death it doesn't matter
[1:43:00] every death is no death it matters
[1:43:03] make sure you get christ don't deny
[1:43:07] yourself make sure you get a hold of god
[1:43:10] praise be to god the devil has
[1:43:13] impoverished the people
[1:43:16] plagued them with sicknesses with
[1:43:18] diseases
[1:43:19] that they are living in error
[1:43:23] and they are content with it
[1:43:26] if this is not an evil spirit tell me
[1:43:28] what it is
[1:43:30] that somebody is dragging you to your
[1:43:32] own distraction
[1:43:34] and you follow anyhow and you are happy
[1:43:36] you are doing it
[1:43:41] like that dog killer who is dragging the
[1:43:43] dogs to their death
[1:43:47] with a chains with the anchor bracelets
[1:43:50] with a leash around their necks dragging
[1:43:53] them to hell
[1:43:55] oh and somebody sits down and looks at
[1:43:58] it and say
[1:43:59] no i have to do something about this
[1:44:01] situation
[1:44:04] i will not allow this to continue
[1:44:05] forever
[1:44:07] i am going to stop this
[1:44:10] and by divine intervention
[1:44:14] by divine intervention
[1:44:17] it was not by the arm of flesh
[1:44:21] but by divine intervention
[1:44:25] god looked down and said no enough is
[1:44:28] enough
[1:44:30] i have to do something about this
[1:44:31] situation praise be to god
[1:44:35] i will not allow this to continue
[1:44:36] forever
[1:44:38] and while we were in the queue
[1:44:42] just waiting for our turn waiting for
[1:44:45] the devil
[1:44:47] to just put his put his his
[1:44:50] his his cruel knife to our throat
[1:44:54] god lose now he says now
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] it's time to do something praise be to
[1:45:03] god
[1:45:05] the bible says what were your sinners
[1:45:08] christ died for us
[1:45:12] he didn't have to wait
[1:45:16] for us to turn right
[1:45:20] a lot of the times we hear people say i
[1:45:22] am waiting
[1:45:24] till i stop sin before i start serving
[1:45:27] god
[1:45:28] and you will never serve god because you
[1:45:30] can never do it on your own
[1:45:33] and if you are able to do it on your own
[1:45:35] then you don't even need god anymore
[1:45:38] amen amen while we were yes sinners
[1:45:42] can you imagine if christ had come
[1:45:46] he said no it is going to be on the
[1:45:48] condition
[1:45:49] that these people must stand right
[1:45:51] before i die
[1:45:52] christ will still be here
[1:45:56] he will still be here if it was not
[1:46:00] based on
[1:46:00] unconditional love that i'm going to do
[1:46:03] it anyhow
[1:46:05] and it was there was a condition to it
[1:46:09] that man has to do this before i die
[1:46:13] he will still be here begging for death
[1:46:16] because we're never going to do our side
[1:46:19] of it
[1:46:21] but why were yet sinners
[1:46:26] he took taught of us why
[1:46:29] were your sinners
[1:46:32] with sin and iniquity weighing us down
[1:46:36] impoverished with sickness and diseases
[1:46:41] carrying that old nature the nature of
[1:46:44] sin
[1:46:45] which is the nature of satan the nature
[1:46:48] of the dog
[1:46:49] and the sheep inside carrying these
[1:46:52] characters on himself
[1:46:56] christ out of us and he said no
[1:46:59] i will not allow this to go on for long
[1:47:02] join on the island of patmos again
[1:47:10] by divine intervention
[1:47:16] when the angel told john to look there
[1:47:20] he saw a bloody sheep it was god himself
[1:47:25] providing himself an offering
[1:47:30] it was not a man's doing
[1:47:33] god provided his own self a sacrifice
[1:47:37] yes sir by divine
[1:47:40] intervention as i have prophesied
[1:47:44] unto us a child is given unto us a child
[1:47:48] is born
[1:47:49] unto us as son is given and the girl
[1:47:51] shall be upon his shoulders
[1:47:54] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:47:57] counselor mighty god everlasting for the
[1:48:00] priest of peace
[1:48:04] and we know the story how the angel
[1:48:06] appeared to marry
[1:48:09] and the holy ghost overshadowed her
[1:48:13] and she became conceived and gave birth
[1:48:18] to the son jesus praise be to god
[1:48:22] it was by a divine intervention
[1:48:26] it was not a man's doing when john the
[1:48:29] baptist
[1:48:30] who else could have identified the lord
[1:48:33] jesus
[1:48:34] more than john the baptist a man that
[1:48:37] was sent
[1:48:38] to forerun his first coming a man that
[1:48:40] was sent with a message
[1:48:42] to get a people ready for his coming who
[1:48:44] else was in the right
[1:48:46] office to identify him the most when he
[1:48:49] saw him
[1:48:49] he said behold the lamb of god
[1:48:52] that takes away the sense of the world
[1:48:56] by a divine hand
[1:48:59] by divine intervention it was no man's
[1:49:03] doing
[1:49:04] now think about it
[1:49:08] the bible says for by grace
[1:49:11] are we saved not of works lust any men
[1:49:14] should boost
[1:49:16] and grace came with the lord jesus
[1:49:22] grace starts with him and grace
[1:49:26] ends with him
[1:49:30] without him you are simply lost
[1:49:35] for he is the beginning and the ending
[1:49:37] of grace
[1:49:40] he is the way the truth and the life no
[1:49:44] man come after the father except by him
[1:49:50] grace now all along we have talked about
[1:49:54] grace
[1:49:55] over a thousand times already digression
[1:49:58] is an undeserved favor a favor we do not
[1:50:01] deserve
[1:50:03] and that has settled yes
[1:50:06] it's a favor we don't deserve thank you
[1:50:09] jesus
[1:50:11] but i was prompted and i have to look
[1:50:14] again
[1:50:16] that in addition to that this was what i
[1:50:20] found
[1:50:21] about grace is the conception
[1:50:26] that all a christian has
[1:50:30] or is is centered
[1:50:35] exclusively in god and christ
[1:50:39] and utterly depends on god through
[1:50:42] christ
[1:50:44] praise be to god all that you are
[1:50:48] and all that you have is exclusively
[1:50:51] centered on god
[1:50:52] and in christ if it's not centered on
[1:50:56] god
[1:50:56] and christ you have to think about it
[1:51:00] again
[1:51:02] so all grace is saying
[1:51:06] here is that
[1:51:11] you cannot make it on your own
[1:51:16] you have found favor with me and i am
[1:51:19] here to see you through
[1:51:21] i am your strength when you are weak
[1:51:24] your righteousness in your filth
[1:51:26] peace in your time of trouble your
[1:51:29] healer when you are sick
[1:51:31] to give you joy when you are in sorrow
[1:51:34] and eternal life
[1:51:35] when sin is dragging you to hell
[1:51:39] for by grace are we saved not of works
[1:51:43] lest any man should boast praise be to
[1:51:46] god
[1:51:47] don't forget that what we are talking
[1:51:49] about this morning
[1:51:51] is from dogs
[1:51:54] to girls by divine
[1:52:00] intervention when you look at jacob
[1:52:04] when jacob was going to bless the sons
[1:52:06] of joseph
[1:52:08] manasseh and ephraim manasseh was the
[1:52:11] oldest
[1:52:12] between the two and according to
[1:52:16] the the birthright i mean the buffer
[1:52:18] always goes to the oldest
[1:52:21] and when joseph brought them
[1:52:24] to jacob at this time the bible says
[1:52:28] that
[1:52:30] jacob's eyes were dimmed so he could not
[1:52:33] see
[1:52:35] so joseph brought manasseh
[1:52:39] to jacob's right hand side and a frame
[1:52:43] to the left
[1:52:45] and so he expected his father to bless
[1:52:47] them
[1:52:51] but jacob turned his cross his hands
[1:52:55] praise be to god and he gave the
[1:52:58] blessing
[1:52:59] that belongs to manasseh the oldest to
[1:53:01] the youngest
[1:53:02] and vice versa
[1:53:05] joseph was not happy with it he said no
[1:53:08] father
[1:53:09] it was not that he was being rude no
[1:53:13] but he knew the order of the birthright
[1:53:15] that it was supposed to go to the oldest
[1:53:17] and he held his father's hand and his
[1:53:19] father said no i know what i'm doing
[1:53:22] praise be to god the first shall become
[1:53:25] the last and last shall become the first
[1:53:29] the bible says that he came to his own
[1:53:32] and he's all received him not but to as
[1:53:36] many as received him he gave up the
[1:53:39] power to be called the sons of god
[1:53:41] praise be to god and at the cross
[1:53:45] at the cross praise be to god
[1:53:49] just as joseph joseph's father jacob
[1:53:52] cross his hands
[1:53:54] to bless the children at a cross
[1:53:57] praise be to god the blessing that was
[1:54:00] supposed to go to the children of
[1:54:01] the jews came to the gentiles
[1:54:06] we that were not fits
[1:54:09] we now were worshipping idols
[1:54:12] worshipping trees
[1:54:14] worshiping the sea watching the moon
[1:54:17] we that did not deserve it praise be to
[1:54:20] god
[1:54:21] by grace by grace
[1:54:25] grace brought us in at the cross
[1:54:30] he was rejected and all the time
[1:54:35] they were beating him and he would fall
[1:54:37] down
[1:54:38] and he would rise up they would kick him
[1:54:40] call him names
[1:54:43] he had a bride on his side
[1:54:47] he was not going alone even though he
[1:54:50] was rejected
[1:54:51] on his side he was going there with his
[1:54:55] bride
[1:54:57] and on the cross when he was nailed
[1:55:00] praise be to god
[1:55:01] and his shadow is finished indeed
[1:55:05] it was finished he overtamed the tables
[1:55:09] 180 degrees the temples were overturned
[1:55:14] now we there were no fit we that were
[1:55:17] feeding on
[1:55:18] cramps cannot sit at table with our lord
[1:55:21] and our master
[1:55:22] and feast on the temp on the same table
[1:55:25] praise be to god that we do no longer
[1:55:28] have to wait on the crumbs
[1:55:31] that will sit at the table with him
[1:55:34] with our conceited dogs have now become
[1:55:37] gods
[1:55:38] praise be to god yes
[1:55:42] praise be to god what a wonderful god we
[1:55:45] serve
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:47] grace has overturned the tables
[1:55:50] grace has overturned the tables
[1:55:54] that when he was pierced on the side
[1:55:56] water and blood came out
[1:55:59] praise be to god and by water baptism
[1:56:02] and the holy ghost baptism
[1:56:03] we find our way back into the body of
[1:56:05] christ
[1:56:06] praise be to god oh my goodness
[1:56:13] you yes thank you
[1:56:16] what a wonderful god we serve yes
[1:56:20] on that day when divinity
[1:56:24] cross path with humanity
[1:56:28] oh my goodness when he lay on the cross
[1:56:31] dying
[1:56:33] he gave his all for us
[1:56:37] praise be to god grace
[1:56:42] has overturned the table
[1:56:45] now he broke the shackles
[1:56:50] he broke the chains he cut the cold
[1:56:54] asunder
[1:56:56] now we that were bound for the slaughter
[1:56:59] have been set free if you are living in
[1:57:03] sin
[1:57:03] it's your choice because a way of
[1:57:07] escape has been made
[1:57:11] there is a way of escape that has been
[1:57:14] made
[1:57:15] if you are living in sin it is your
[1:57:18] choice
[1:57:22] you are still carrying that nature of
[1:57:24] the dog if you are living in sin
[1:57:27] amen and not only are you carrying the
[1:57:29] nature of the dog
[1:57:30] that makes you a dog
[1:57:35] to carry still carry the nature of dog
[1:57:38] on you makes you a dog
[1:57:42] and if after a wave of escape has been
[1:57:45] made
[1:57:46] you choose to still live in sin
[1:57:49] that is the most dangerous thing
[1:57:52] i dare say that you are having worse
[1:57:55] than a dog
[1:57:58] a dog has no soul
[1:58:04] when you cut the truth and you eat it
[1:58:06] that's the end of his life
[1:58:12] i don't know what is what what about the
[1:58:13] dog meat
[1:58:15] but those people they will tell you is
[1:58:17] the best meat i never eat it before
[1:58:19] and i don't want to try it i'm not
[1:58:21] saying if you're eating it
[1:58:22] it's wrong i'm not saying that i mean if
[1:58:25] you want to that's okay
[1:58:34] here in america if you are tempted
[1:58:38] you go to jail you never come out
[1:58:44] it's true
[1:58:48] but where i come from if you go to the
[1:58:52] police station
[1:58:53] when the police is asking what is the
[1:58:55] address
[1:58:57] don't think he's going to arrest anybody
[1:59:01] he just wants to go and get his chair
[1:59:09] grace of attended tables
[1:59:14] we that were filthy
[1:59:17] we that was so dirty we
[1:59:20] thought were so evil so abominable
[1:59:25] so disgraceful
[1:59:28] what are the adjectives to even use
[1:59:33] what are the adjectives in a very
[1:59:37] miserable condition
[1:59:40] very pitiful living in a life of
[1:59:45] dejection
[1:59:48] working on dangerous grounds and all we
[1:59:51] were good for
[1:59:52] was nothing but hell
[1:59:58] but god by his grace
[2:00:01] by a divine hand by divine intervention
[2:00:06] god by his grace came
[2:00:09] and he overturned the tale that today
[2:00:14] we can talk about the almighty god being
[2:00:18] our god
[2:00:19] amen praise the lord we can talk about
[2:00:22] having the holy ghost baptism
[2:00:25] that we can live a clean life
[2:00:28] and let the world know that in this
[2:00:31] world we are living
[2:00:32] there are a people that can live a clean
[2:00:38] life
[2:00:41] you don't have to compromise your
[2:00:42] christian values
[2:00:46] wherever you find yourself remember that
[2:00:50] you are called to live
[2:00:51] the life of an example you are
[2:00:55] light and light shines the best
[2:00:59] in darkness in the world of darkness if
[2:01:03] you are alone
[2:01:04] shine the light don't wait till there
[2:01:07] are brothers and sisters around you
[2:01:10] wherever you find yourself whether at
[2:01:13] work in school
[2:01:14] in your community neighborhood let the
[2:01:16] light shine
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:18] for that is who you are
[2:01:22] that is who you are
[2:01:25] let the light shine for the bible says
[2:01:28] let your light soul shine that man may
[2:01:31] see your good works
[2:01:32] and give the glory to your father which
[2:01:34] is in heaven
[2:01:37] let your life so shine before men
[2:01:41] don't compromise on your values
[2:01:45] what has this world got to offer you
[2:01:48] for how long would a man live in this
[2:01:50] life
[2:01:53] maybe there are some of you here want to
[2:01:54] live hundred years i don't want it
[2:01:58] does it mean i want to die now no
[2:02:04] yes i love my wife i love my children i
[2:02:08] love every one of you
[2:02:11] so i want to hang around for a little
[2:02:12] while
[2:02:14] and not only that but i believe i have a
[2:02:17] lot of
[2:02:18] digging to do on the devil's back
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:22] and it's not because i want to enjoy the
[2:02:24] vegas and the rice
[2:02:25] no i have had enough of that already
[2:02:30] but there is one thing you can never
[2:02:31] have enough of that is god
[2:02:35] praise be to god
[2:02:42] grace not only did grace find
[2:02:46] us
[2:02:50] but grace called us by name
[2:02:54] that when you heard the voice of god
[2:02:56] something in you responded to it
[2:03:02] while you say had that doggie nature on
[2:03:04] you
[2:03:07] the sheep inside of you when he had that
[2:03:10] voice
[2:03:11] he said no
[2:03:14] something changed
[2:03:18] grace called us by name and not only
[2:03:21] that
[2:03:22] grace wrote our names on the rock
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:27] not on the tree back not on the back of
[2:03:30] the house
[2:03:31] not in the sun but on a rock
[2:03:34] there is no amount of rainfall there is
[2:03:37] no amount of sunshine
[2:03:38] there is no hurricane there is no
[2:03:40] excavation that can take the
[2:03:42] name of the rock
[2:03:45] [Music]
[2:03:46] our names were written in the lamb's
[2:03:49] blood
[2:03:51] and written on the rock there is no
[2:03:54] persecution
[2:03:56] there is no sickness there is no disease
[2:04:00] there is no difficulty there is no
[2:04:04] mesh in it there is nothing that can
[2:04:07] take you away from the love of god
[2:04:11] god would not save you today to lose you
[2:04:13] tomorrow
[2:04:17] praise be to god
[2:04:21] our names are written in in in the in
[2:04:24] the lamb's blood
[2:04:27] nothing can erase it nothing can erase
[2:04:31] it
[2:04:33] praise be to god grace
[2:04:37] has tenders changed our destiny
[2:04:42] now his death made the way
[2:04:47] unlike the blood of busan ghosts his
[2:04:50] blood was
[2:04:51] strong enough to change our nature
[2:04:54] from sin
[2:04:58] to that of god's
[2:05:02] so you realize that the nature change is
[2:05:04] very important
[2:05:08] it's not so much about
[2:05:12] you saying that your sins have been
[2:05:15] forgiven
[2:05:19] but the nature change is
[2:05:22] crucial it's very important
[2:05:25] we can never over emphasize that
[2:05:31] if the blood of bulls and ghosts could
[2:05:35] forgive the people their sins and
[2:05:38] couldn't change their nature
[2:05:40] that they had to go back and do the
[2:05:43] things they were doing
[2:05:45] so much that god has to send his only
[2:05:47] begotten son
[2:05:48] to come and die to forgive us our sins
[2:05:50] and change our nature
[2:05:51] he tells you how important it is
[2:05:56] to have a nature change
[2:06:02] you don't have to profess to be a child
[2:06:06] of god
[2:06:07] and you still carry the doggy nature
[2:06:11] you still carry the sin nature on you
[2:06:17] that when you get among the people of
[2:06:18] the world you fit incorrectly
[2:06:23] and you can't even be more than them
[2:06:28] and now when you get among believers and
[2:06:31] then you fit in there
[2:06:33] no there is something wrong with the
[2:06:34] picture
[2:06:38] light and darkness do not have any
[2:06:40] fellowship of any kind
[2:06:44] wherever there is light there is no
[2:06:45] darkness because there is light
[2:06:52] you can't have the nature of god
[2:06:56] the nature of god to which we have been
[2:06:59] called
[2:07:00] and still be running after the chance of
[2:07:02] this life
[2:07:04] still living in sin doing things you
[2:07:07] know you are not supposed to do
[2:07:10] that you look on your shoulder to see if
[2:07:12] there is a known face
[2:07:14] any time you get to a place and you want
[2:07:17] to do something
[2:07:18] and you have to look across your
[2:07:19] shoulder don't do it
[2:07:22] you know within you that is wrong
[2:07:30] praise the lord praise be to god
[2:07:35] john 10 33 35 you can note it down
[2:07:40] the bible says ye are gods
[2:07:44] unto whom the word has come
[2:07:51] ye are gods unto whom
[2:07:55] the word of god has come
[2:08:01] the almighty god is coming
[2:08:04] for god's on two feet
[2:08:08] it is the word of god in you
[2:08:11] that makes you a god small
[2:08:15] g.o.d
[2:08:19] the word of god in you when you accept
[2:08:22] the word
[2:08:23] when you embrace the word of god when
[2:08:26] you are working in the word
[2:08:27] when you are living according to the
[2:08:29] word when the word becomes your absolute
[2:08:33] praise be to god guess what you are the
[2:08:36] white on two feet
[2:08:38] you have become a god because the word
[2:08:40] of god has come to you
[2:08:44] and that is the same way it is if you
[2:08:46] embrace the devil's lies
[2:08:48] and you are living in sin and you are
[2:08:50] living in iniquity
[2:08:51] and you are doing this you are not
[2:08:53] supposed to do you have become a dog
[2:09:02] the almighty god is coming for god
[2:09:06] on two feet
[2:09:10] and that is going to be spirit of his
[2:09:12] spirit
[2:09:13] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones
[2:09:18] praise be to god he is coming for god
[2:09:24] um so
[2:09:27] when saul went to consol the witch of
[2:09:30] endor
[2:09:33] and then he had the wish of ender to
[2:09:34] cost him well for him
[2:09:37] i don't want to go through the whole
[2:09:38] story i wouldn't want to keep you here a
[2:09:40] minute longer than i'm supposed to
[2:09:43] praise be to god and then the witch of
[2:09:46] endo called
[2:09:47] samwell what did the witch of endor say
[2:09:51] he said i see ghosts arising from the
[2:09:55] earth
[2:09:57] so that means you have to be a god while
[2:10:00] you are alive
[2:10:01] to be a god at horizon you can die a
[2:10:05] dog and rise up a god it cannot happen
[2:10:10] you must be a god while you are still
[2:10:13] alive
[2:10:15] that when you are going down you are
[2:10:17] going down with the expectation
[2:10:20] that on that resurrection morning you
[2:10:22] are going to rise up
[2:10:28] praise be to god okay
[2:10:35] you know it looks very much like
[2:10:44] the witch of another said i see ghosts
[2:10:48] arising praise be to god
[2:10:52] my soul went there to ask the witch
[2:10:57] to bring forth what someone by the way
[2:11:01] says
[2:11:01] i see god's arising that means
[2:11:04] it was not only somewhere who rose up
[2:11:09] praise be to god there were a people
[2:11:13] that had believed in someone's message
[2:11:16] there were a people that were living
[2:11:18] according to this is his word
[2:11:20] and i believe when he rose up they
[2:11:23] thought it was the resurrection morning
[2:11:26] they also rose up somewhere we believe
[2:11:28] that message
[2:11:29] where are you going he said oh
[2:11:34] listen to what someone said he said so
[2:11:38] why have you disquieted me
[2:11:42] he was having his sleep
[2:11:46] and i believe
[2:11:50] that he didn't only disquiet somewhere
[2:11:52] alone
[2:11:54] he disquieted a lot
[2:11:57] hold fast hold fast
[2:12:02] to what you have believed
[2:12:05] hold fast to the message of the hour
[2:12:08] give it your all live by the word of god
[2:12:13] or bear the prophet's word live by the
[2:12:16] word of god
[2:12:18] and one of these days when the trump
[2:12:21] goes off praise be to god the bible says
[2:12:23] that that will crush a rise first
[2:12:25] we shall meet up in the air
[2:12:28] water rain or shine we shall defy
[2:12:31] gravity
[2:12:32] one of these days
[2:12:38] praise be to god he said i see
[2:12:41] ghosts arising
[2:12:46] your life today determines
[2:12:50] where you're going to spend eternity
[2:12:54] don't think you can live any crooked
[2:12:56] life
[2:12:58] a sinful life live a shameful life
[2:13:03] live a daily life and then
[2:13:07] when you die something will change
[2:13:13] that you will change from a sinner to a
[2:13:16] saint
[2:13:17] or from the dog nature to the nature of
[2:13:20] christ no
[2:13:21] it has to be while you are alive
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:25] you must be a god while you are alive
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:31] so you can be one at arizona
[2:13:35] praise be to god
[2:13:38] now in the message demonology
[2:13:43] in the message demonology the prophet
[2:13:46] says
[2:13:46] the only hand that christ has tonight is
[2:13:49] our hands
[2:13:51] all the lips he has he is certain by the
[2:13:55] father
[2:13:56] he is sent the holy spirit back
[2:14:00] the third person the trinity to bear
[2:14:03] record
[2:14:04] of his being which is god
[2:14:08] god that does god in us and the bible
[2:14:11] said
[2:14:12] we become jesus he said
[2:14:15] we and we become gods
[2:14:18] in a form scripture says so
[2:14:22] see we are gods
[2:14:25] because why we are the sounds of god
[2:14:30] um that way we are we
[2:14:34] just because i'm i'm i'm i'm ibrahim
[2:14:38] because i come out of that branham
[2:14:41] branch
[2:14:45] and in that way we are sons of god
[2:14:47] offspring
[2:14:48] of god you believe that prayers be to
[2:14:51] god
[2:14:53] so grace brought us
[2:14:56] in even though we are sheep in the
[2:15:00] inside
[2:15:03] he had to come
[2:15:06] to die for us because a mixed identity
[2:15:10] cannot inherit the kingdom of god
[2:15:14] praise be to god
[2:15:18] we can talk about the king who organized
[2:15:21] a wedding feast
[2:15:24] you know for his son i really want to go
[2:15:27] into that so much
[2:15:28] but just to summarize it
[2:15:32] those to whom the feast was organized
[2:15:34] didn't show up
[2:15:36] and we all know the story and he asked
[2:15:39] his servants to go out there and just
[2:15:42] invite anybody that would come
[2:15:45] and the people that did not deserve it
[2:15:48] their names were not even in spite they
[2:15:51] were those who ended up
[2:15:53] in the hall to have the feast so are we
[2:15:57] praise be to god salvation
[2:16:01] was of the jews it was not for you and i
[2:16:07] but god in his divine wisdom
[2:16:12] made sure they were blinded so we
[2:16:16] the gentiles can come in
[2:16:20] this is the greatest opportunity the
[2:16:23] greatest opportunity
[2:16:25] any human any mortal could ever get
[2:16:31] there is nothing that compares to it the
[2:16:34] book of isaiah
[2:16:36] 1 18 says come and let us
[2:16:39] reason together say the lord do your
[2:16:43] sins be as scarlet
[2:16:44] they'll be as white as snow though they
[2:16:47] be as red as crimson
[2:16:49] they shall be as wool praise be to god
[2:16:53] the greatest invitation any mortar
[2:16:56] could ever get it's not to the white
[2:16:58] house
[2:17:00] it's not to the queen's palace
[2:17:04] the greatest invitation any man could
[2:17:06] ever get
[2:17:07] that the almighty the almighty god
[2:17:10] is saying come and let us reason
[2:17:13] together
[2:17:14] praise be to god
[2:17:18] what grace has done
[2:17:23] you can't compare that to anything under
[2:17:25] the sun
[2:17:29] if you have to live in a homeless
[2:17:30] shelter
[2:17:32] in order to manifest christ do it
[2:17:38] if you have to sleep in your car boot
[2:17:41] to manifest the beauty of christ in your
[2:17:43] soul do it
[2:17:48] if you have to live on a half loaf of
[2:17:50] bread
[2:17:52] for people to see the beauty of christ
[2:17:54] in you do it
[2:17:57] whatever condition you find yourself in
[2:18:01] do not compare yourself to others around
[2:18:03] you
[2:18:05] you are not called to compare yourself
[2:18:08] to others
[2:18:12] we are called one standard and that is
[2:18:16] god
[2:18:17] don't look at others not even brothers
[2:18:20] and sisters around you
[2:18:22] because the bible says they don't
[2:18:24] compare themselves to one another are
[2:18:25] not wise
[2:18:30] if a brother or sister is not living
[2:18:32] right you talk to them
[2:18:34] the best you can if you have to pray for
[2:18:37] them
[2:18:39] but do not descend to their level
[2:18:44] no
[2:18:48] we are called to live an exemplary life
[2:18:57] don't settle for anything
[2:19:00] don't settle for anything other than god
[2:19:04] make sure that you have gotten ahold of
[2:19:07] god
[2:19:10] it is not enough to come to church
[2:19:14] it is not enough to read your bible
[2:19:18] because there are people out there who
[2:19:20] read who go to church
[2:19:22] every single day but their lives
[2:19:26] do not portray christ
[2:19:30] their nature has not changed
[2:19:34] the nature change people must see christ
[2:19:38] in you
[2:19:39] because the bible says we are written
[2:19:41] epistles
[2:19:42] sin and read of all men
[2:19:46] your life is an open book
[2:19:52] people must should be able to read
[2:19:55] to read the bible through you
[2:19:59] christianity is not lived it's
[2:20:02] secret no
[2:20:06] a christian does not have a secret life
[2:20:08] amen
[2:20:10] your life is an open book that everybody
[2:20:12] can read from
[2:20:14] that they look at your life and they can
[2:20:16] see christ in your life
[2:20:19] glory be to god
[2:20:22] that is why the bible says you will not
[2:20:24] light a lamp and put it under a bush
[2:20:28] praise be to god
[2:20:32] i'll i'll i'll be leaving you here late
[2:20:34] in about five minutes
[2:20:37] so come and let us reason together
[2:20:40] oh what a wonderful god we serve
[2:20:46] that he has picked us picked us from the
[2:20:49] gutter
[2:20:52] i don't know about you
[2:20:55] but the gutter he picked me from
[2:20:58] it's a very dirty one a very dangerous
[2:21:02] gutter
[2:21:04] very filthy i don't know about how i
[2:21:07] mean the gutter you were lying in
[2:21:10] picnics from the garbage can from the
[2:21:12] trash can
[2:21:14] from the boiler i don't know whether you
[2:21:17] guys know what the boiler is
[2:21:20] how many of you know hot boilers
[2:21:23] that's a dump ground that were out
[2:21:26] there in the liquor parlor
[2:21:32] were out there in the strip joints
[2:21:37] were out there
[2:21:41] in the streets in the drug in the drug
[2:21:44] pens
[2:21:46] we were out there and we thought we're
[2:21:49] living life
[2:21:51] killing ourselves i will not even
[2:21:55] we're not showing any remorse we will
[2:21:58] come and sit down
[2:21:59] and talk boldly about it and knock our
[2:22:01] chest
[2:22:02] as if we did something good that is how
[2:22:05] wicked the devil is
[2:22:07] but god by his grace reached his holy
[2:22:11] hand
[2:22:12] his holy hand where his hand should not
[2:22:15] go
[2:22:17] why the holy hand should not go talking
[2:22:20] about
[2:22:21] from dogs to girls it's not to let you
[2:22:25] see
[2:22:25] how low you weigh no
[2:22:28] yes for you to
[2:22:32] remember it doesn't matter how low you
[2:22:35] weigh
[2:22:35] for somebody to pick you up the fellow
[2:22:38] must go lower than you
[2:22:43] that he went lower he went
[2:22:46] lower to be able to pick you up
[2:22:51] he reached his holy hand where it should
[2:22:54] not go
[2:22:55] bad for grace but for grace
[2:23:00] he allowed it picked us up
[2:23:04] from our wretchedness from our foolish
[2:23:07] ways
[2:23:09] from our sins and from our iniquities
[2:23:13] and washed us and gave us
[2:23:17] an identity that we can now say
[2:23:21] that we are children of the most high
[2:23:23] god
[2:23:24] because the word of god
[2:23:27] has come to us
[2:23:30] and we have become gods
[2:23:34] unto whom the word of god has come
[2:23:39] purely by grace
[2:23:43] purely by not of works
[2:23:49] not by the arm of flesh but by divine
[2:23:52] intervention
[2:23:54] praise be to god the musicians can come
[2:23:58] over
[2:24:02] from dogs
[2:24:05] to gods by divine
[2:24:12] intervention
[2:24:14] if you cherish what god has done for you
[2:24:19] you would want to live the rest of your
[2:24:21] life
[2:24:22] appreciating it
[2:24:26] and the only way to appreciate what god
[2:24:28] has done for you
[2:24:31] is to live by his word that shows how
[2:24:35] much
[2:24:36] you appreciate what he has done
[2:24:40] you don't turn the grace of god into
[2:24:43] disgrace
[2:24:45] you cherish it that should mean
[2:24:49] everything to you
[2:24:52] think about it this life will surely
[2:24:55] come to an end
[2:24:57] like i was saying i shot a while ago i
[2:25:00] don't want to live up to 100 years no i
[2:25:01] don't like it
[2:25:03] get to that place where i will look like
[2:25:06] a baby
[2:25:07] and they will be changing my diapers i'm
[2:25:09] not like i don't like it
[2:25:12] maybe you would enjoy it i don't want it
[2:25:16] i don't want to ever get there
[2:25:21] when the lord is finished with me i want
[2:25:22] to live
[2:25:24] when god is done with me i want to go
[2:25:28] and think about that joy now when that
[2:25:30] day comes
[2:25:32] and you are crossing your eyes and you
[2:25:34] are taking your last breath
[2:25:36] there is a hope in you oh praise be to
[2:25:40] god
[2:25:40] my goodness that i'm stepping out of
[2:25:43] this flesh
[2:25:44] but i'm stepping in another one more
[2:25:46] glorious
[2:25:48] and now on that day on that resurrection
[2:25:50] morning
[2:25:51] oh praise be to god i am going to rise
[2:25:53] anyhow
[2:25:54] [Music]
[2:26:00] praise be to god
[2:26:01] [Music]
[2:26:05] do not let the devil fool you
[2:26:10] this world is gone there is nothing more
[2:26:14] left
[2:26:18] just go to work go to school
[2:26:24] pay the bills
[2:26:28] whatever you want to do
[2:26:32] if god does not stop you go ahead
[2:26:37] but always put god first
[2:26:41] when you step out there tell yourself
[2:26:45] that i am a daughter of god tell
[2:26:47] yourself
[2:26:48] i am a son of god and when you step out
[2:26:52] there wherever you find yourself
[2:26:53] remember that you are a child of god
[2:26:58] the heaven is looking down to you
[2:27:02] [Music]
[2:27:03] when the storms arise
[2:27:07] tell yourself
[2:27:10] that you are a child of god and heaven
[2:27:13] is concerned
[2:27:16] don't forget that god is depending on
[2:27:19] you
[2:27:22] god is depending on you
[2:27:25] as the prophet of god said the only
[2:27:27] hence he has
[2:27:29] it's our hands the only feet he has is
[2:27:32] our feet
[2:27:35] god is depending on you
[2:27:40] we have let god down countless number of
[2:27:43] times
[2:27:44] but tell yourself that enough is enough
[2:27:47] [Music]
[2:27:48] enough is enough don't let the devil
[2:27:52] keep pushing you and pushing you and
[2:27:54] pushing you to your own distraction
[2:27:57] don't take it
[2:27:58] [Music]
[2:28:01] it's a choice you have to make
[2:28:04] the devil can never force it
[2:28:09] [Music]
[2:28:11] people do things and so the devil made
[2:28:13] me do it no the devil didn't make you do
[2:28:15] it
[2:28:15] [Music]
[2:28:17] it's out of your own lust that you did
[2:28:20] it the devil didn't do it
[2:28:22] if god created us and put us on the
[2:28:25] basis
[2:28:26] of a free moral agency that you can
[2:28:29] decide
[2:28:30] whether to serve god or not then that
[2:28:32] also tells you
[2:28:34] that it also applies to the devil
[2:28:37] you can also decide whether
[2:28:40] to serve the devil or not
[2:28:44] it's a decision you have to make
[2:28:49] decision time praise be to god
[2:28:53] from dogs
[2:28:57] once upon a time we were all there
[2:29:01] to gods as we are seated here today
[2:29:05] that by the grace of god we have become
[2:29:07] gods
[2:29:09] because the word of god has come to us
[2:29:12] we have become gods
[2:29:15] that even though we are pleased
[2:29:18] to be servants he says no
[2:29:22] i call you friends because the servant
[2:29:26] does not know what the master does
[2:29:28] but you do
[2:29:32] we are pleased even to be dormant
[2:29:35] in the house of god but he says no
[2:29:40] [Music]
[2:29:42] we sit at the same table a table we
[2:29:46] never deserved
[2:29:47] and would never have deserved but for
[2:29:50] the sake of grace
[2:29:52] through christ
[2:29:53] [Music]
[2:29:56] our lives should speak about him from
[2:30:00] now on
[2:30:02] for you to know that whatever it is that
[2:30:05] you are today
[2:30:06] whatever it is that you are doing today
[2:30:09] even being alive today
[2:30:12] is the grace of god it's what god has
[2:30:15] done for you
[2:30:18] we can never pay god back what he has
[2:30:21] done
[2:30:22] but if we can only live by the word of
[2:30:25] god on a daily basis
[2:30:26] to show our appreciation to that god
