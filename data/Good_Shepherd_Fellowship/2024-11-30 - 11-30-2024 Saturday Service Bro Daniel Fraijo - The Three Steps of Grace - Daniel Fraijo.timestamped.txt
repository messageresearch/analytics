[38:13] uh the more times we get to
[38:15] minister the more times we feel the the
[38:18] weight and the burden the
[38:20] responsibility that souls are laying on
[38:23] the
[38:24] line that uh God's people need a a word
[38:28] of
[38:29] encouragement uh a word of teaching an
[38:32] Apostolic word a prophetic word an
[38:34] Evangelistic word and God has a fivefold
[38:38] Ministry to be able to unfold that to us
[38:42] and yet God
[38:43] didn't didn't bring the five full
[38:46] ministry that they would be Lords over
[38:47] the people but the five full ministry is
[38:50] to be servants to God's
[38:52] people even if it was said of John the
[38:55] Baptist Jesus himself said
[38:58] of of men born of women there is not
[39:00] risen a greater than John the
[39:02] Baptist but of those in the Kingdom of
[39:05] Heaven he is least he is least of all
[39:09] yeah so it was never God's intention to
[39:12] rise up a a hierarchy of Men's
[39:15] Leadership but it was God's intention to
[39:18] use men and anoint them so that you
[39:21] could be born again so that you could
[39:24] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:28] and so you throughout your Christian
[39:29] Life Could re receive filling after
[39:32] refilling of the Holy
[39:35] Spirit if you'll turn with me into your
[39:38] Bibles to Romans chapter
[39:43] 3 Romans chapter 3 we'll be begin
[39:46] reading at verse
[39:48] 26 and we'll go down to verse
[39:54] 31 three steps of Grace
[40:01] that take us to a restored friendship
[40:03] with the father and that and that
[40:05] restored friendship both Jesus and Paul
[40:08] and Peter all taught us it's a process
[40:10] called
[40:11] adoption and that process of adoption
[40:14] takes us to Perfection the Capstone of
[40:17] Our
[40:21] Lives Romans 3:
[40:25] 26-31 and to declare I say at this time
[40:28] his righteousness that he might be just
[40:31] and the justifier of him which believeth
[40:33] in Jesus where is boasting then it is
[40:37] excluded by what law of Works nay but by
[40:40] the law of
[40:42] Faith therefore we conclude that a man
[40:44] is justified by faith without the Deeds
[40:48] of the
[40:49] law is he the god of the Jews only is he
[40:53] not also of the Gentiles yes of the
[40:55] Gentiles also
[40:57] seeing it is one God which justifieth
[41:00] the circumcision by faith and the
[41:03] uncircumcision through
[41:05] faith do we then make void the law
[41:07] through faith God forbid yay we
[41:11] establish the law it would sound like
[41:14] Paul is going back and forth on this
[41:18] thought but in reality Paul took the Old
[41:22] Testament and brought the revelation of
[41:24] that Old Testament the types and the
[41:27] Shadows of the Bible and and made it
[41:29] real but that's where he was rejected of
[41:32] Israel not when he spoke by memory many
[41:36] verses of the Old Testament and the
[41:38] prophecies but when he began to tell
[41:41] them this day this man Jesus of Nazareth
[41:45] is Messiah King of the Jews Lion of the
[41:48] tribe of Judah by Revelation that's
[41:50] where Paul got in trouble with the world
[41:53] but not with God CU it was a revelation
[41:56] and he was sharing it with the mystical
[41:59] body of Jesus Christ at the first
[42:01] coming let's pray Heavenly Father we
[42:05] thank you once again this evening ask
[42:08] your blessings upon this Thy Word in
[42:11] Jesus name amen you may be
[42:18] seated I'd like to say that Jesus became
[42:23] part of the
[42:24] problem died in your place Rose the
[42:28] third day and then became the solution
[42:31] to your problem died with your curse so
[42:34] you could inherit his Blessing eternal
[42:37] life in the message future home of the
[42:40] Heavenly bride it starts at paragraph
[42:43] 467 he said Adam was to multiply and
[42:45] replenish the Earth that right Noah was
[42:49] after the new world was destroyed was to
[42:51] multiply and replenish the Earth he says
[42:53] get it now can't you see what the
[42:55] serpent seed is what replenished the
[42:58] Earth you get it all right you see how
[43:01] Satan got to Eve now that's why death
[43:03] has rained on Earth ever since and
[43:06] Heavens Earth Beast atmosphere is all
[43:09] cursed of God because of it that's the
[43:12] curse because Satan got to her first
[43:15] Jesus came to redeem it back to the
[43:17] father in order to do this he became
[43:20] part of
[43:20] it as I've just went through and from
[43:24] that very and from that very dust the
[43:27] the part Jesus was himself being
[43:29] redeemed through him all of the
[43:32] attributes of God are redeemed with the
[43:36] Earth in Romans chapter 4 and verse 20
[43:40] Paul speaks and tells us we were
[43:43] delivered for our offenses and ra and he
[43:47] raised for our
[43:48] justification Romans
[43:50] 4:20 he staggered not at the promise of
[43:53] God through unbelief but was strong in
[43:56] faith giving glory to God and being
[43:59] fully persuaded that he had promised he
[44:01] was able also to perform and therefore
[44:04] it was imputed to him for righteousness
[44:07] now it was not written for his sake
[44:09] alone that it was imputed to
[44:11] him but for us also to whom it shall be
[44:15] imputed for We Believe on him that
[44:17] raised up Jesus our lord from the dead
[44:21] justified by faith Paul said we have
[44:24] peace towards God but
[44:28] a person in this state of
[44:31] justification it's really hard to tell
[44:33] that God's working on their lives yet
[44:36] and yet indeed it's the first step of
[44:38] the grace of God these three steps of
[44:41] Grace for a man justified by faith he
[44:46] has he has come to an understanding that
[44:49] what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary
[44:51] he's making it personal to himself now
[44:54] that he did it for me justified by faith
[44:57] faith I was tell the testimony of a of a
[45:01] brother that tamy he says I was just
[45:03] talking to a man he says and he invited
[45:06] me to go to his a Bible study with him
[45:09] and
[45:10] um and he's all excited telling me you
[45:13] should come with me we're really having
[45:14] a great time studying the Bible and uh
[45:18] and uh and and and God's doing a a work
[45:21] in my life and you should come and he
[45:24] goes well maybe I will come but that
[45:27] time he reaches in his pocket he pulls
[45:29] out a pack of cigarettes puts one in his
[45:31] mouth lights it up and now he's smoking
[45:34] and now he's saying how wonderful that
[45:37] that God has touched his heart so this
[45:39] brother looks at me and says why you
[45:42] dirty little hypocrite he tells
[45:45] him uh not
[45:48] realizing that a a true work of
[45:52] justification all it means is that
[45:54] person has come to a recognition that is
[45:57] Jesus of Nazareth who died on the cross
[45:59] of Calvary that by faith he can claim
[46:02] this work of the blood for his life he's
[46:05] just now begun but it's very hard to
[46:08] detect especially if we're caught in a
[46:11] moment of our
[46:12] carnality I don't know if that's ever
[46:14] happened to you maybe it just happens to
[46:15] old people like me but but it's
[46:19] happened justified by faith we have
[46:21] peace towards God Romans 5 and verse
[46:24] one therefore being justified if IED by
[46:27] faith we have peace with God through our
[46:29] Lord Jesus Christ someone might say how
[46:32] can you have peace towards God and you
[46:34] still has habits she still has habits
[46:37] she still needs big changes in her life
[46:39] that's what justification brings it
[46:42] brings a peace despite despite all the
[46:46] complexes that Satan has put on their
[46:48] lives it brings a peace to their hearts
[46:51] that they've got a Hope they've got a
[46:54] hope he said therefore being justified
[46:57] by faith we have peace with God through
[46:59] our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we
[47:02] have access by faith into this grace
[47:05] wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of
[47:08] the glory of God the AIS now is
[47:12] sanctification by the spirit the access
[47:15] now is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[47:17] Fire and not only so but we glory in
[47:20] tribulations also knowing that
[47:23] tribulation worketh patience and
[47:26] patience EXP experience and experience
[47:28] hope so when a person understands that
[47:31] they've been justified by faith they've
[47:34] got a Hope they've got a peace they can
[47:36] press
[47:38] forward they can press
[47:41] forward and hope maketh not ashamed
[47:44] because the love of God is shed abroad
[47:46] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[47:48] given unto us for when we were yet
[47:52] without Strength In Due Time Christ died
[47:57] for each and every one of
[47:59] us
[48:01] justification by faith on the on the on
[48:04] the finished work of what Jesus did on
[48:07] the cross of Calvary the blood that he
[48:09] shed that washes us white as snow that
[48:13] blood is is a barrier from the Throne
[48:16] all the way down to planet Earth that
[48:18] blood the father looks through the blood
[48:21] of Jesus and he sees you all just
[48:23] perfect just the way just the way he saw
[48:26] you when you are an attribute in the
[48:28] mind of God and yet we know we need more
[48:32] to be changed even more
[48:34] yet but it's it's because of the blood
[48:36] of Jesus Christ that lifts up a
[48:40] barrier sanctification by the spirit
[48:43] Holiness we're practicing the right
[48:46] thing for the right reason when you're
[48:49] Sanctified by the spirit and God is
[48:53] leading you to Holiness in your life
[48:56] from justification to
[48:58] sanctification then we're practicing the
[49:01] right thing for the right reason we
[49:04] desire to be like our lord Jesus we love
[49:07] him because he first loved us we see how
[49:09] great this kingdom of God is where God's
[49:12] kingdom is the blood wash Born Again
[49:14] Believers to whom the to whom the
[49:16] mysteries of God are opening and
[49:18] unfolding in our
[49:20] lives in St John chapter 3 beginning at
[49:24] verse one you all by Bible readers you
[49:27] could almost quote it back quote it by
[49:29] heart to me there was a man of the
[49:31] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[49:34] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[49:38] said unto him
[49:39] Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher
[49:42] come from God for no man can do these
[49:45] Miracles you do except God be with him
[49:48] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[49:52] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[49:55] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[49:59] God God's kingdom is a kingdom of
[50:01] Holiness God's kingdom is a is Holiness
[50:05] in Friendship God's kingdom is Holiness
[50:07] in sunship God's King kingdom is
[50:10] Holiness in courtship God's kingdom is
[50:12] Holiness in marriage God's kingdom is
[50:15] Holiness in Ministry in music in
[50:18] musicians God's kingdom is a kingdom of
[50:22] Holiness for
[50:24] deacons for marriages for
[50:28] pastors in Romans 12 and verse one the
[50:32] Apostle Paul says I beseech you
[50:34] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[50:38] that you present your bodies a Living
[50:40] Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God
[50:43] which is your reasonable
[50:45] service you haven't gone too far when
[50:48] you do that the world tells you've gone
[50:51] too far but the Bible tells you no no
[50:54] you haven't gone too far there's more
[50:56] yet and Paul said and be not conformed
[50:59] to this world but ye be ye transformed
[51:02] by the renewing of your mind that ye may
[51:04] prove what is that good and acceptable
[51:06] and perfect will of
[51:08] God justification
[51:11] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[51:13] Ghost forms this complete Born Again
[51:17] experience in the message the third seal
[51:20] Prophet says but then if the Pentecostal
[51:23] message was the last message which
[51:25] justification sanctification the baptism
[51:28] of the Holy Ghost the last three
[51:30] messages the last three Church ages
[51:33] forms the complete
[51:36] birth the Born Again
[51:39] experience justified by faith Sanctified
[51:43] by the spirit baptized with the Holy
[51:46] Ghost and
[51:48] Fire brother
[51:50] Daniel how much space is in between each
[51:53] one of those experien
[51:56] you don't need any space between those
[51:59] experiences you can you can go from one
[52:01] to the next to the
[52:04] next some of us go a little further some
[52:09] of us it takes a little longer some it
[52:11] takes a little shorter but
[52:14] nonetheless if if God is working in your
[52:17] life time means nothing to God what he's
[52:21] interested is purging you of all the
[52:23] complexes of life so that you can be
[52:25] free in in Christ
[52:30] Jesus Paul said to the Corinthians you
[52:33] are the temple of God know ye not that
[52:36] you are the temple of God and that the
[52:38] spirit of God dwelleth in
[52:41] you that should challenge
[52:45] us to how we should live our lives
[52:49] daily know ye not that you are the
[52:51] temple of God and that the spirit of God
[52:54] dwelleth in you If any man defile the
[52:57] temple of God him shall God destroy for
[53:01] the temple of God is Holy which Temple
[53:04] you are but if you're a Son of God with
[53:08] the seed of God in your
[53:10] hearts he just takes the clay and
[53:12] smashes it all down again and begins
[53:15] molding it once
[53:18] again yeah that's that's what he does
[53:21] for every son and daughter of God
[53:27] in first Thessalonians 4
[53:30] 1-8 Apostle Paul speaks about possessing
[53:33] Your Vessel in
[53:35] sanctification furthermore then we
[53:37] beseech you Brethren and exhort you by
[53:39] the Lord Jesus that as ye have received
[53:41] of us how we ought to walk and to please
[53:44] God so ye would abound more and more for
[53:47] you know what Commandments we gave you
[53:49] by the Lord Jesus for this is the will
[53:52] of God even your
[53:55] sanctification that you have abstain
[53:57] from
[53:58] fornication that every one of you should
[54:00] know how to possess his vessel in sanc
[54:03] sanctification and honor not in the lust
[54:06] of concupisent even as the Gentiles
[54:09] which know not God that no man go beyond
[54:12] and defraud his brother in any matter
[54:14] because the Lord is the Avenger of all
[54:16] such as we also have forewarned you and
[54:20] testified for God ha not called us unto
[54:23] uncleanness but unto holiness
[54:26] God wants a
[54:28] church that lives a life worthy of the
[54:32] gospel God wants us to practice
[54:36] Holiness at home at work at the church
[54:40] at
[54:43] school and it will give you victory in
[54:45] your
[54:46] life because if you're not ashamed of
[54:49] him he'll stand for you in those
[54:53] moments to the Romans Paul says I speak
[54:57] after the manner of men because of the
[54:59] infirmity of your flesh for as ye have
[55:01] yielded your members servants to
[55:03] uncleanness and to iniquity unto
[55:07] iniquity even so now yield your members
[55:10] servants to righteousness unto
[55:12] Holiness in Romans
[55:15] 6:22 the Apostle Paul says but now being
[55:18] made free from sin and become servants
[55:21] to God ye have your fruit unto
[55:25] holiness and the end everlasting
[55:31] life to the Corinthians he
[55:34] says having therefore these promises
[55:37] dearly beloved let us cleanse oursel
[55:40] from all filthiness of the Flesh and
[55:42] spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear
[55:46] of
[55:47] God in 2 Corinthians 6
[55:52] 1-8 Paul speaking to the
[55:55] Corinthians it was a very challenging
[55:57] group of people to Pastor the
[56:00] Corinthians but nonetheless he gave them
[56:03] all the conso of God by which they could
[56:06] be free in
[56:07] Christ we then as workers together with
[56:10] him beseech you also that you receive
[56:13] not the grace of God in vain for he
[56:16] saith I have heard thee in a Time
[56:18] accepted in the day of salvation I have
[56:21] suckered thee behold now is the accepted
[56:24] time behold now is the day of salvation
[56:27] giving no offense in anything that the
[56:30] ministry be not blamed but in all things
[56:32] approving ourselves as the Ministers of
[56:34] God in much patience in afflictions in
[56:37] necessity in distresses in stripes in
[56:41] imprisonments in tumults in labors and
[56:43] watchings and fastings by pureness of
[56:46] knowledge by longsuffering by kindness
[56:49] by the Holy Ghost by Love unfe by the
[56:52] word of Truth by the word of God by the
[56:54] armor of righteousness on the right hand
[56:56] and on the left oh my he's speaking to
[56:59] the
[57:01] ministry and it leaves us
[57:03] feeling that we fall
[57:06] short but nonetheless we press on in
[57:09] Jesus name
[57:11] amen by Honor and dishonor by evil
[57:14] report and good report as deceivers and
[57:16] yet true as unknown and yet well known
[57:19] as dying and behold we live as chastened
[57:22] and not killed as sorrowful yet always
[57:25] rejoicing as poor yet making many rich
[57:28] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[57:30] things oh ye Corinthians our mouth is
[57:33] open unto you our heart is
[57:35] enlarged you are not straightened in us
[57:38] but you are straightened in your own
[57:40] bowels now for a recompense in the same
[57:44] I speak as unto my children be also
[57:47] enlarged be not unequally yolked
[57:50] together with unbelievers for what
[57:52] Fellowship has righteousness with
[57:54] unrighteousness and what communion at
[57:56] light with
[57:58] darkness in a world when we can go get
[58:01] so easily
[58:02] connected through the internet with all
[58:05] kinds of
[58:06] people may God give you wisdom and
[58:09] discernment to shut those things down
[58:13] and have fellowship with Believers have
[58:16] fellowship with Elders who will
[58:18] encourage you to follow Jesus
[58:27] but ye but be ye not unequally yolked
[58:29] together with unbelievers for what
[58:31] Fellowship has righteousness with
[58:33] unrighteousness what communion hath
[58:35] light with darkness and what conquered
[58:37] hath Christ with belile or what part
[58:40] hath he that believeth with an
[58:43] Infidel and what agreement hath the
[58:45] temple of God with Idols for ye are the
[58:48] Temple of the Living God as God had said
[58:50] I will dwell in them and walk in them I
[58:53] will be their God and they shall be my
[58:55] people
[58:56] wherefore come out from among them and
[58:58] be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch
[59:01] not the unclean thing and I will receive
[59:07] you in Romans
[59:15] 12 in verse
[59:17] one I beseech you therefore Brethren by
[59:21] the mercies of God that you present your
[59:24] bodies a Living Sacrifice
[59:26] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[59:30] reasonable
[59:31] service and be not conformed to this
[59:34] world but be transformed by the renewing
[59:36] of your mind that you may prove what is
[59:39] that good and acceptable and perfect
[59:42] will of
[59:44] God if there's something I
[59:47] see that's not being done enough it's
[59:51] the reading of this
[59:52] Bible in our homes in our churches
[59:57] at our family altars with our
[59:59] children there was one thing a prophet
[1:00:01] said if you'd like to be more spiritual
[1:00:04] he said read your Bible and pray every
[1:00:08] day because not everything a prophet
[1:00:11] said was was the Deep prophetic things
[1:00:15] of God he told us many times he was just
[1:00:18] giving his
[1:00:21] opinion but when you make it all thus
[1:00:24] sayith the Lord then then you begin
[1:00:26] threading on on Dangerous
[1:00:32] Grounds for I say through the grace
[1:00:34] verse three given unto me to every man
[1:00:37] that is among you not to think of
[1:00:39] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:00:41] think but to think soberly according as
[1:00:43] God hath dwelt to every man The Measure
[1:00:46] of Faith for as we have many members in
[1:00:49] one body and all members have the same
[1:00:51] off and all members have not the same
[1:00:53] office so we being many are one body in
[1:00:56] Christ and everyone members one of
[1:00:59] another having then gifts differing
[1:01:02] according to the grace that is given to
[1:01:03] us whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:01:06] according to the proportion of Faith or
[1:01:09] Ministry let us wait on our ministry or
[1:01:12] he that teacheth on teaching or he that
[1:01:14] exalteth on exhortation he that giveth
[1:01:17] let him do it with Simplicity he that
[1:01:20] ruleth with diligence he that showeth
[1:01:22] Mercy with cheerfulness let love be
[1:01:25] without
[1:01:26] dissimilation abhor that which is evil
[1:01:29] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[1:01:31] affectionate one to another with
[1:01:34] Brotherly Love in honor preer pre

[1:03:17] that book is the
[1:03:18] Bible and if you read chapter 12 of here
[1:03:22] in Romans it's just the beginning of
[1:03:25] advice
[1:03:26] of how to establish yourself as a father
[1:03:28] in your home each and every word because
[1:03:32] it's a man in action it's a man doing
[1:03:35] things for the saints of God it's a man
[1:03:38] doing things for his family this is a
[1:03:41] this is a father being anointed of the
[1:03:43] heavenly
[1:03:48] father in the message white Christ speak
[1:03:52] 1959 paragraph 12 Prophet begins
[1:03:56] he said and then if you just accepted
[1:03:58] him as your personal Savior and have not
[1:04:01] received the Holy Ghost I trust that
[1:04:03] tonight you'll receive it I see some of
[1:04:06] the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to
[1:04:08] say this about the big sister see one
[1:04:11] thing that the Tabernacle needs up there
[1:04:14] at our church at Tabernacle that at the
[1:04:17] Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and
[1:04:21] a refilling of the Holy Ghost wow
[1:04:30] everyone to get down to the Altar and
[1:04:32] pray until they get a renewing of the
[1:04:35] Holy Ghost the whole church filled with
[1:04:37] the power of God and that's what we need
[1:04:40] not only the Tabernacle there but the
[1:04:42] body of Christ Universal it needs a
[1:04:45] refilling the refilling of the Holy
[1:04:48] Ghost it's not a
[1:04:51] reward for having be behaved yourself
[1:04:54] really good for one week
[1:04:57] no no the refilling of the Holy
[1:05:01] Ghost is the victory that God sends you
[1:05:04] to overcome that Temptation and that
[1:05:08] trial he didn't send you a
[1:05:11] refilling to reward you he sent you a
[1:05:15] refilling to give you the strength you
[1:05:17] need to be an
[1:05:20] overcomer David said one day restore to
[1:05:23] me the joy of my salvation now he that
[1:05:26] had now he had not lost his salvation
[1:05:29] but the joy of it and it when it comes
[1:05:31] to a place that I can't enjoy my
[1:05:33] religion my salvation there's something
[1:05:36] wrong somewhere because it's joy
[1:05:38] unspeakable and full of Glory one of
[1:05:41] them said taste and see that the Lord is
[1:05:43] good it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh
[1:05:47] I'm so glad that I've tasted that the
[1:05:49] Lord is good and I love honey but I
[1:05:52] never tasted anything like that that's
[1:05:54] the best that I I
[1:05:56] know Apostle Peter in second Peter

[1:06:05] of Jesus Christ to them that have

[1:07:13] Jesus Christ in other words unable or
[1:07:21] unwilling for if these things be in you
[1:07:23] and abound they make that that you shall
[1:07:26] neither be unable or
[1:07:31] unwilling in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:07:34] Jesus
[1:07:35] Christ the very the very nature of
[1:07:39] God a people entering into adoption
[1:07:43] these These are people that when they
[1:07:45] come to this place they've been they've
[1:07:48] been born again they've been justified
[1:07:50] by faith they received the baptism of
[1:07:52] the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:07:56] how did they receive it it might have
[1:07:59] been a very quiet moment all to
[1:08:02] themselves it might they might have
[1:08:04] spoken
[1:08:05] tongues they might have shouted real
[1:08:07] loud they might have just sat in their
[1:08:10] chair and shook with reverence for the
[1:08:12] peace of God that passes all
[1:08:14] understanding that's
[1:08:16] right but one thing that the baptism of
[1:08:19] the Holy Ghost and Fire does for
[1:08:21] everyone it gives you a life worthy of
[1:08:24] the Gospel
[1:08:26] it gives you a heart like
[1:08:29] David that he was ready to
[1:08:31] repent any any mistake anything he did
[1:08:35] he was
[1:08:36] ready he would he would bear the shame
[1:08:39] to to be redeemed of of that
[1:08:45] sin but he that lackthe things is blind
[1:08:49] and cannot see a far off and have
[1:08:51] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:08:53] old sins wherefore the rather bre and
[1:08:55] give diligence to making your calling
[1:08:58] and election sure for if you do these
[1:09:00] things you shall never fall for so an
[1:09:04] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[1:09:06] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[1:09:08] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ your
[1:09:12] your life is not going through a process
[1:09:15] of sons and daughters being
[1:09:19] adopted being adopted and your tutor is
[1:09:23] the father himself
[1:09:25] wherefore I will not be neg negligent to
[1:09:28] put you always in remembrance of these
[1:09:30] things though you know them and be
[1:09:32] established in the present truth yay I
[1:09:34] think it meat as long as I am in this
[1:09:36] Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you
[1:09:40] in remembrance knowing that shortly I
[1:09:43] must put off this Tabernacle even as our
[1:09:45] Lord Jesus Christ had showed me moreover
[1:09:48] I Endeavor that you may be able to after
[1:09:50] my decease to have these things always
[1:09:53] in
[1:09:53] remembrance for we have not followed
[1:09:56] cunning devis
[1:09:57] fables when we made known unto you the
[1:10:00] power of the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:10:02] Christ but were eyewitnesses of his
[1:10:05] majesty for he for he received from God
[1:10:08] the Father honor and Glory when there
[1:10:10] came such a voice to him from the
[1:10:12] excellent Glory this is my beloved Son
[1:10:15] in whom I am well pleased to no other
[1:10:18] man on the Earth was this statement made
[1:10:21] it was Jesus Christ and him alone there
[1:10:24] is no other name on under Heaven by
[1:10:26] which we can be saved except the name of
[1:10:28] Jesus
[1:10:31] Christ and this voice which came from
[1:10:33] heaven we heard when we were with him on
[1:10:36] the holy Mount we have also a more sure
[1:10:39] word of Prophecy where unto you do well
[1:10:41] that you take heed as unto a light that
[1:10:44] shineth in a dark place until the day
[1:10:47] Dawn and the day star arise in your
[1:10:51] hearts the three steps of Grace in a
[1:10:55] very in a very
[1:10:59] brief and
[1:11:01] short
[1:11:04] statements but the three steps of Grace
[1:11:07] take us to the Born Again
[1:11:10] experience and those and that Born Again
[1:11:13] experience takes us unto
[1:11:16] Perfection
[1:11:18] Perfection through a restored friendship
[1:11:20] with the father adoption is the process
[1:11:24] but Perfection is the Capstone of
[1:11:26] this Psalms 51
[1:11:30] 1-10 the psalmist
[1:11:33] David it's a Psalm of David when Nathan
[1:11:36] the prophet came to him after he had
[1:11:38] gone into basba and he says have mercy
[1:11:41] upon me oh God according to thy loving
[1:11:44] kindness according unto the multitude of
[1:11:46] thy Tender Mercies blot out my
[1:11:49] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[1:11:51] my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[1:11:56] I acknowledge my transgressions and my
[1:11:58] sin is ever before me against thee the
[1:12:01] only have I sinned and done this evil in
[1:12:03] thy sight that thou mightest mightest be
[1:12:06] justified when thou speakest and be
[1:12:08] clear when thou judges behold I was
[1:12:11] shapen in
[1:12:13] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[1:12:16] conceive me behold thou desireth truth
[1:12:19] in the inward parts and in the hidden
[1:12:22] part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom
[1:12:25] Purge me with his and I shall be clean
[1:12:28] wash me and I shall be whiter than snow
[1:12:31] that statement is more true today than
[1:12:34] it has ever been when David said it it
[1:12:37] was something he hoped for but we can
[1:12:40] say it by Revelation and God can cleanse
[1:12:46] us make me to
[1:12:48] hear joy and gladness that the bones
[1:12:51] which thou has broken May Rejoice hide
[1:12:54] thy face for my sins and blot out all my
[1:12:56] iniquities create in me a clean heart oh
[1:12:59] God and renew a right Spirit within me
[1:13:04] it was a
[1:13:05] prophecy David could David by even by
[1:13:08] faith could not get a hold of this
[1:13:10] prophecy because they without us could
[1:13:13] not be made
[1:13:15] perfect but when we come to this stature
[1:13:19] of
[1:13:20] perfection then our statue of
[1:13:23] perfection raised es
[1:13:26] up all that have gone before unto
[1:13:30] Perfection Matthew 5 and:
[1:13:33] 48 Jesus says be ye therefore perfect
[1:13:38] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:13:40] is
[1:13:42] perfect few years back I was doing work
[1:13:44] for a man he was a uh one of a few
[1:13:48] pastors for a big mega church there in
[1:13:50] Phoenix and uh very nice man a real
[1:13:53] gentleman so of course we got to speak
[1:13:56] in about the word and
[1:13:59] uh and as he was hearing me talk he says
[1:14:03] dan I perceive that you're a bit on the
[1:14:06] calvinistic side he tells me I said his
[1:14:09] name was Bert I said Bert actually I'm
[1:14:12] like 5050 calvinist and Armenian
[1:14:16] 50/50 I said cuz each of them had some
[1:14:20] Truth uh and and when you put them
[1:14:22] together you get more truth and more
[1:14:24] detail but yet God has given us truth
[1:14:27] beyond that
[1:14:28] today be ye therefore perfect Jesus said
[1:14:32] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:14:34] is
[1:14:36] perfect this is verse 48 of Matthew 5
[1:14:40] the reason he said be ye therefore
[1:14:42] perfect it's declaring his subject that
[1:14:45] he was speaking of in Matthew 5 this is
[1:14:49] a conclusion
[1:14:51] statement so from verse 1 to 47
[1:14:55] Jesus preached Perfection to the
[1:14:58] church Jesus preached the Born Again
[1:15:01] experience justified by faith Sanctified
[1:15:04] by the spirit Jesus preached the little
[1:15:07] baby steps to get to this point in verse
[1:15:09] 48 when he made a conclusion
[1:15:12] statement be ye therefore
[1:15:15] perfect
[1:15:17] um Lord what does that mean that means
[1:15:21] you read too fast the first 47 verses
[1:15:25] and I want you to go back and read them
[1:15:27] again because Jesus was speaking on
[1:15:30] Perfection Hebrews 6 and verse
[1:15:33] one therefore leaving the principles of
[1:15:35] the doctrine of Christ Paul says to the
[1:15:38] Hebrews let us go on unto Perfection not
[1:15:42] laying again the foundation of
[1:15:44] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[1:15:46] toward
[1:15:47] God perfect it means to make perfect to
[1:15:52] complete uh to bring something to an end
[1:15:55] to add to what is what is lacking in
[1:15:58] order to render a full thing to bring to
[1:16:01] an end as a goal to bring to a close or
[1:16:04] fulfillment of events like the
[1:16:05] Prophecies of the
[1:16:07] Bible an exposition of the seven Church
[1:16:10] ages brother brandham says this
[1:16:13] tribulation worketh
[1:16:15] patience how highly God regards this
[1:16:18] outworking of our PR patience is seen in
[1:16:20] James 1:4 but let patience have her
[1:16:23] perfect work that that you may be
[1:16:25] perfect and entire lacking nothing God's
[1:16:28] will for us is perfection and that
[1:16:30] Perfection is patience waiting on God
[1:16:33] and waiting for God this is the process
[1:16:35] of character development how highly God
[1:16:38] has commended these Saints of the Dark
[1:16:40] Ages patient as Lambs led to the
[1:16:43] slaughter lovingly faithly they serve
[1:16:45] God that is all they wanted out of life
[1:16:48] just service to their lord and how great
[1:16:52] was their reward he says
[1:16:55] so Perfection has a process and the Lord
[1:16:58] Jesus was the first ever to bring us a
[1:17:00] teaching of all the components that take
[1:17:02] us to Perfection the process is called
[1:17:05] the adoption of Sons and Daughters of
[1:17:07] God the process to arrive to adoption is
[1:17:09] called the three steps of Grace in
[1:17:12] Galatians chapter 4 the Apostle Paul
[1:17:15] says this to the Galatians to redeem
[1:17:17] them that were under the law that we
[1:17:20] might receive the adoption of sons and
[1:17:22] because ye are Sons God hath sent forth
[1:17:25] the Holy Spirit of his son into your
[1:17:27] hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou
[1:17:31] Art no more a servant but a son and if a
[1:17:34] son then heir of God through Christ an
[1:17:38] heir to
[1:17:40] Perfection what is perfection to be as
[1:17:43] Eternal as the father is
[1:17:47] eternal the One Pastor said we cannot be
[1:17:51] perfect then I'm going to stop you right
[1:17:52] there he said I read him the that's the
[1:17:55] scripture in Matthew 5:48 he says we
[1:17:58] cannot be Perfection per perfect he
[1:18:02] says I said uh Bert I want to say we can
[1:18:08] be
[1:18:09] perfected it's the way we view
[1:18:11] Perfection do we view it through a
[1:18:13] diction through a dictionary description
[1:18:17] or do we view it through the words of
[1:18:19] Jesus
[1:18:21] himself and a prophet told us if God
[1:18:23] requires perfection
[1:18:25] then he's got to find a way to make you
[1:18:27] perfect but the Perfection was to
[1:18:29] finally reach unto eternal
[1:18:33] life with rapturing faith and transport
[1:18:37] it from this
[1:18:42] world Galatians 4:5 and 7 to redeem them
[1:18:46] that were under the law that we might
[1:18:48] receive the adoption of
[1:18:50] sons wherefore Thou Art no more a
[1:18:53] servant but a son
[1:18:55] and and if a son then an heir of God
[1:18:58] through Christ to the Ephesians he said
[1:19:02] according he has chosen Us in him before
[1:19:04] the foundation of the world that we
[1:19:06] should be holy and Without Blame before
[1:19:09] him in
[1:19:12] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:19:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:19:19] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:19:22] of his will to the Romans he said in
[1:19:26] chapter 8 verse1
[1:19:27] 15 for ye have not received the spirit
[1:19:32] of bondage again to
[1:19:36] fear for ye have not received the spirit
[1:19:40] of bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:19:43] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:19:46] re cry ABA father my father my father
[1:19:52] Hallowed be thy name th King kingdom
[1:19:55] come thy will be done in this Earth as
[1:20:00] it is in
[1:20:04] Heavens Paul's speaking to the Galatians
[1:20:07] Galatians
[1:20:09] 5:19 he says now the works of the flesh
[1:20:12] are manifest which are
[1:20:14] these adultery fornication uncleanness
[1:20:18] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[1:20:21] hatred variance emulation wrath Strife
[1:20:24] sedition
[1:20:25] heresies envies murders drunkenness re
[1:20:29] revellings and such like of the which I
[1:20:32] tell you before also I have also told
[1:20:34] you in time past that they that they
[1:20:37] which do s such things shall not inherit
[1:20:41] the kingdom of
[1:20:42] God it's not enough to say uh I I accept
[1:20:47] William brandom as as as as Malachi 4
[1:20:50] that ain't enough it's not enough to say
[1:20:53] I recognize that he's the seven th Angel
[1:20:55] that's not
[1:20:56] enough there's a life that God wants us
[1:21:00] to live there's a life of faith in his
[1:21:03] word that God wants us to practice there
[1:21:05] is a Holiness that he wants us to keep
[1:21:09] to but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:21:12] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:21:15] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:21:17] against such there is no law if we live
[1:21:19] in the spirit let us also walk in the
[1:21:23] spirit let us not be desirous of Eng
[1:21:25] gloring provoking one another envying
[1:21:29] one
[1:21:31] another before we come to this
[1:21:33] relationship as sons being adopted there
[1:21:37] are three steps justification by
[1:21:40] faith
[1:21:42] sanctification by the spirit and God the
[1:21:46] great Holy Spirit can change you so your
[1:21:48] own mother wouldn't even recognize
[1:21:52] you God can change you
[1:21:55] but we have to ask for
[1:21:56] change we've got to plead for change
[1:22:00] we've got to get on our knees at the
[1:22:01] foot of the
[1:22:03] cross and believe his blood covers and
[1:22:06] Rise Up from there with newness of
[1:22:15] Life justification by faith
[1:22:18] sanctification by the spirit the baptism
[1:22:21] of the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:22:25] you're you're a vessel that's been
[1:22:27] washed and cleaned
[1:22:30] Sanctified and the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:33] Ghost is a few little drops at the
[1:22:36] bottom of that
[1:22:40] glass and what you're going to receive
[1:22:42] between now and God time God takes you
[1:22:43] from here is refilling after refilling
[1:22:47] till your cup runneth over and this body
[1:22:50] of Flesh can no longer contain the work
[1:22:53] that God is doing in your
[1:22:56] soul prise the Lord there was the
[1:22:59] parable where Jesus said he says if you
[1:23:03] pour new wine into old wine skins he
[1:23:06] says won't it burst out and you lose all
[1:23:08] the new
[1:23:10] wine and I've read it for years since I
[1:23:12] was a child and I thought okay yeah that
[1:23:15] makes sense but one day it just dawned
[1:23:18] on me that that's exactly what God is
[1:23:21] doing to his
[1:23:22] children he is feeling us with new
[1:23:25] wine until we get until that new wine is
[1:23:29] so flowing and bubbling over that this
[1:23:33] old body this old wine skin can't hold
[1:23:36] it no
[1:23:37] more so it wasn't just a parable to the
[1:23:40] negative but to the positive as is All
[1:23:43] The Parables of
[1:23:47] Jesus excuse
[1:23:50] me these three bring us to a restored
[1:23:53] friendship with the father it's called
[1:23:57] adoption unto
[1:24:07] perfection in Hebrews chapter 7 Paul
[1:24:11] told the
[1:24:12] Hebrews for there's verely a
[1:24:14] disannulling of the
[1:24:16] Commandment going before for the
[1:24:18] weakness and unprofitableness
[1:24:21] thereof and not only one commandment but
[1:24:24] all 10 for the law made nothing perfect
[1:24:28] but the bringing in of a better hope did
[1:24:31] by the which we draw nigh unto
[1:24:34] God so yes Paul is speaking of all Ten
[1:24:37] Commandments and Jesus in his Parable
[1:24:39] and adoption and Perfection Al mentions
[1:24:42] them and tells us how they're being
[1:24:44] disowned cancelled abolished
[1:24:49] invalidated here is the admonition of
[1:24:51] God when he was opening the book that
[1:24:53] Adam lost
[1:24:55] and telling us things that had been hid
[1:24:56] since the foundation of the
[1:24:59] world and it's a scripture that's for me
[1:25:01] it's as as important as all scriptures
[1:25:05] but even as important as as in the book
[1:25:08] of
[1:25:12] Acts Matthew
[1:25:15] 13:34 all these things spake Jesus unto
[1:25:18] the multitude and in Parables and
[1:25:21] without a parable spoke he not unto them
[1:25:24] Matthew was reaching back into the Old
[1:25:26] Testament and from the Psalms he was
[1:25:27] pulling out this Prophecy of the style
[1:25:30] and Ministry of Jesus Christ he said all
[1:25:33] these things spake Jesus into the
[1:25:35] multitude in Parables and without a
[1:25:37] parable spoking not unto them that it
[1:25:40] might be fulfilled which was spoken that
[1:25:41] by the prophet saying I will open my
[1:25:44] mouth in Parables I will utter things
[1:25:46] which have been kept secret from the
[1:25:48] foundation of the world then Jesus sent
[1:25:51] the multitude away and went into the
[1:25:52] house and his disciples came unto him
[1:25:55] saying declare unto us the parable of
[1:25:57] the tears of the
[1:26:00] field and when the multitudes had all
[1:26:02] gone he began to speak to his disciples
[1:26:05] he answered and said unto them he that
[1:26:07] sth the good seed is the son of man and
[1:26:11] he be began bringing the revelation of
[1:26:14] this prophetic word in these Parables so
[1:26:17] everything that Jesus spoke wasn't a
[1:26:22] parable Matthew 28 8 19 go you out into
[1:26:26] all the world and preach the gospel
[1:26:28] teaching them to be baptized in the name
[1:26:30] of the father and of the Son and the
[1:26:32] Holy Ghost it seems pretty clear-cut
[1:26:35] what you should what you should be
[1:26:38] doing and and
[1:26:40] trinitarian those that hold that
[1:26:42] trinitarian
[1:26:43] Doctrine they have told me Daniel you go
[1:26:46] ahead and believe uh Peter a backslid
[1:26:49] fisherman but I'm going to believe Jesus
[1:26:52] the son of God
[1:26:57] see so I said okay I said I said I said
[1:27:02] well the Pentecostal people uh align
[1:27:05] themselves in the same
[1:27:07] way we've been baptized in the name of
[1:27:10] Jesus Christ because those are titles
[1:27:13] but those were more than just
[1:27:15] titles that was a parable that was the
[1:27:18] prophetic word and on the day of
[1:27:21] Pentecost a prophet was given the
[1:27:23] revelation of that prophetic word and
[1:27:25] they just mesh right
[1:27:27] together but without
[1:27:29] Revelation those scriptures don't mesh
[1:27:32] those scriptures
[1:27:33] hit and they've been hitting for
[1:27:35] thousands of
[1:27:37] years but today by the grace of God
[1:27:41] God's given you and I a revelation we
[1:27:44] realize it was a parable like the
[1:27:47] parable like the parable of the of the
[1:27:50] two
[1:27:51] sons the prodical son it was really a
[1:27:55] parable of two
[1:27:57] churches the younger son was a gentile
[1:28:01] people and the older son was Israel who
[1:28:04] refused to come and get involved in the
[1:28:08] Revival that was taking place it was a
[1:28:11] prophecy in a
[1:28:14] parable not way in the future right
[1:28:17] there that day that scripture was taking
[1:28:20] place before Israel before the high
[1:28:22] priest and all his and all the Liv and
[1:28:24] all the
[1:28:25] Levites and The Parables continue to
[1:28:28] unfold in this manner everyone is a
[1:28:31] prophetic word unfolding a mystery of
[1:28:37] God God rich in
[1:28:43] Mercy Matthew
[1:28:46] 13:34 all these things spake Jesus unto
[1:28:48] the multitude in Parables and without a
[1:28:51] parable spoke he not unto them that it
[1:28:53] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:28:55] the prophet saying I will open my mouth
[1:28:57] in Parables I will utter things which
[1:29:00] have been kept secret from the
[1:29:01] foundation of the world I Jesus when I
[1:29:05] come I'll be speaking things that only
[1:29:07] the ears of Adam have ever
[1:29:10] heard but now I'm coming to tell it to
[1:29:12] you my children to give you the same
[1:29:16] experience to give you the same Born
[1:29:18] Again experience to cause you to be born
[1:29:21] again to receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:24] ghost and in hard trials ask God for the
[1:29:27] refilling that you need don't let the
[1:29:30] devil trick
[1:29:32] you that what that what that what that
[1:29:35] what you are struggling with means that
[1:29:39] you're not worthy no what you're
[1:29:40] struggling with is a complex of life and
[1:29:44] a refilling of the Holy Ghost will give
[1:29:46] you the victory over that complex that's
[1:29:49] right
[1:29:51] right that it might be fulfilled verse
[1:29:53] 35 which was spoken by the prophet
[1:29:55] saying I'll open my mouth from Parables
[1:29:57] all other things which have been kept
[1:29:59] secret from the foundation of the world
[1:30:01] then Jesus sent the multitude away and
[1:30:04] went into the house and his disciples
[1:30:07] came unto him saying declare unto us the
[1:30:09] parable of the tears of the
[1:30:12] field for the first time since he spoke
[1:30:15] it to Adam once again lip to ear to
[1:30:19] Adam's Fallen race this is what Adam
[1:30:21] heard that day in Eden just before the
[1:30:24] fall when the father told
[1:30:27] him be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:30:31] father which is in heaven is
[1:30:34] perfect I know you might be thinking no
[1:30:36] no brother Daniel this is New Testament
[1:30:39] that's Old Testament
[1:30:42] Genesis what part of God's word is Old
[1:30:47] Testament and New Testament what part of
[1:30:50] thus saith the
[1:30:51] Lord is too old to you or tune you to
[1:30:58] understand God has
[1:31:01] said to his children to his
[1:31:04] people that he's going to bring to you
[1:31:09] all these things that he gave to
[1:31:12] Adam and it's from this admon
[1:31:16] admonition and divine teaching that Adam
[1:31:19] and Eve fell Adam Eve be ye therefore
[1:31:23] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:31:25] heaven is perfect they had arrived to
[1:31:28] that spot in their lives they had
[1:31:31] arrived to that spot with the father
[1:31:32] tutoring them and it was from there that
[1:31:36] they
[1:31:37] fell none of us are too great that we
[1:31:39] can't fall if we let down the
[1:31:44] guard we must seek
[1:31:47] Him brother Daniel how do I do
[1:31:50] that read your Bible and
[1:31:54] pray every
[1:31:58] day do you love him tonight yes so these
[1:32:02] are not just New Testament admonitions
[1:32:05] this was in the mind of God before the
[1:32:07] foundation of the world and God has made
[1:32:10] a path baby steps that you can take he
[1:32:15] has made a way because he's a way
[1:32:18] maker and he wants you to keep walking
[1:32:20] by faith and not by sight do you love
[1:32:24] him tonight as we stand to our
[1:32:35] feet let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[1:32:39] you once again tonight for your Amazing
[1:32:43] Grace for your word of God for
[1:32:46] scriptures that Lord we not only read
[1:32:48] them with hope but Lord you're bringing
[1:32:51] them to pass in our lives and for this
[1:32:53] we we thank you and we give you all the
[1:32:55] honor the glory and the praise bless
[1:32:58] Lord your church here in Minnesota and
[1:33:02] Minneapolis Lord be with each and
[1:33:04] everyone in the struggles they're going
[1:33:06] through Lord God send them another
[1:33:09] refilling of this Holy Ghost and power
[1:33:12] and we'll be sure to thank you Lord and
[1:33:15] may may there come testimonies of these
[1:33:18] refilling we realize that the that the
[1:33:22] refilling of the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:33:24] reward no it's the sword of God it's the
[1:33:28] faith of God it's the victory Of God
[1:33:31] it's how we overcome our trials filling
[1:33:34] after refilling after refilling and for
[1:33:37] this Lord we thank you in Jesus name
[1:33:41] amen amen God bless you all tonight
[1:33:56] well praise the Lord the Lord bless you
[1:33:58] you may have your
[1:34:00] seat and
[1:34:02] uh that's
[1:34:05] beautiful that's very beautiful praise
[1:34:08] the
[1:34:09] Lord you know God is
[1:34:12] uh is
[1:34:14] so is so
[1:34:17] uh wonderful in the way that he made us
[1:34:21] he made us you know wow very different
[1:34:24] just like we said you you pray for
[1:34:26] brother Daniel tomorrow that the Lord
[1:34:27] would give him strength I know that
[1:34:30] against uh uh every art in his body he
[1:34:33] tried to
[1:34:36] fulfill uh all righteousness tonight
[1:34:39] because he was on his lot to preach so
[1:34:41] he tried to to make his body obey his
[1:34:45] confession amen so you pray for him but
[1:34:49] I think there's uh there is something
[1:34:51] that is
[1:34:52] wonderful there something that is
[1:34:54] wonderful I was just I was just looking
[1:34:56] at uh what brother Danel read there over
[1:35:00] in U Matthew Chapter 5 and Jesus said be
[1:35:06] ye therefore
[1:35:07] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[1:35:14] perfect you know just like he
[1:35:17] said the word
[1:35:20] therefore means as a result
[1:35:28] that's what the word therefore means as
[1:35:30] a
[1:35:31] result so everything that Jesus said
[1:35:35] from verse one the
[1:35:38] result of faith is to be
[1:35:42] perfect praise the Lord you will see
[1:35:46] Paul used the same word in
[1:35:48] Hebrew he said therefore let's go on to
[1:35:51] perfection
[1:35:56] as a result of everything that the Lord
[1:35:58] has given to
[1:36:01] us the result of it was to bring us to
[1:36:07] Perfection praise the
[1:36:09] Lord the word of God is so so beautiful
[1:36:13] amen it's so beautiful it's so
[1:36:17] beautiful the S we start appreciating
[1:36:21] and understanding that it is not our
[1:36:24] effort the soon we start
[1:36:28] realizing that the grace that is given
[1:36:30] to us is to appreciate what he have done
[1:36:34] for us the sooner you start appreciating
[1:36:38] there the closer you will get to
[1:36:42] God praise the
[1:36:45] Lord you know we have made everything
[1:36:49] like a rat race and you know and and and
[1:36:53] and you know who can shout louder who
[1:36:55] can jump higher you know and and who can
[1:36:58] run
[1:37:00] faster but uh if we realize that uh we
[1:37:05] are we are just walking in the finished
[1:37:08] work it's a work that been finished from
[1:37:10] the foundation of the word and God just
[1:37:13] want you and myself to come to a
[1:37:17] knowledge and
[1:37:19] appreciate what he has already done for
[1:37:23] us
[1:37:24] the sooner we get to understand that we
[1:37:27] get to seize
[1:37:29] that we will start
[1:37:32] enjoying we will
[1:37:34] start uh eating the fruit of our
[1:37:38] Salvation praise the Lord amen because
[1:37:42] you see the uh
[1:37:45] uh Salvation will not mean much to us if
[1:37:50] we can enjoy it amen praise the Lord
[1:37:54] amen if we can enjoy it and uh I mean uh
[1:37:59] what what is the need of coming to
[1:38:00] church if we can enjoy
[1:38:03] church you know and and that's the
[1:38:05] reason why many are falling away from
[1:38:07] church because all they are either
[1:38:09] staying away from church or they are
[1:38:12] changing Church to be a place of
[1:38:17] entertainment because we must enjoy
[1:38:20] it but you see there is there is there a
[1:38:24] there there a there's a there's a lot of
[1:38:26] joy you know uh uh in in the word it's
