our bibles now and read a portion of a portion in the scripture here i want us to read i thought i would get back on the we were talking about the lord to everything that's the lord and talking about the law of nature and the law that god puts in nature or he puts in everything and but i thought caught my mind this afternoon and i tried to bring it on on there but i pray that the lord will be able to to bless you tonight amen let's read from the book of numbers numbers chapter 3 praise the lord numbers chapter 3. numbers chapter 3 will read from verse 49 to the last verse we read from verse 49 numbers chapter 3 we read from verse 49. the scripture says here and moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the levites of the firstborn of the children of israel took he the money at a thousand three hundreds three hundred and threes called and five shekels after the shakeouts of the sanctuary praise the lord ephesians chapter 1 ephesians chapter 1. let's hope i will place that into numbers we'll be coming back there and but we want to look at paul uh ephesians chapter one ephesians chapter one over here in the verse 13 paul says verse 12 let's read from verse 12. why not read from verse 11. amen i hope i won't carry you back any father oh and then back for in whom also we have obtained uninheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ praise the lord in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye have believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory amen praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seat tonight number one you've been listening to adoption series so you're right there with me tonight uh praise the lord i want i want to look at something here a little better uh it's around the lord of redemption there was there's a lot of redemption and uh i i want to look at that a little bit here i will read read this from kingsman redeemer now remember praise the lord amen amen praise the lord and well well we thank the lord okay sister uh george is is being thankful for the birthday and she want us to thank the lord for granting her another year praise the lord amen happy birthday sister praise the lord as soon as the pastor children that can stop him when he's preaching praise the lord so let's let's read this tonight i want for us to look at this together and uh i know i know sometime back it should be a while now uh should be some years back we spoke on the redemption money i want to look into that a little bit uh not now to teach on it but uh to be able to draw something from there now remember the law of redemption as we are coming to close yeah oh the lord of redemption is this that before a man could redeem a lost property he had to be a nearest king's man and the next thing he had to be an upright man a just man to do it and then he had to be worth enough money to do it and then he had to make a public testimony that he had done it and from then on it was his property now in that sense is talking about the requirement or the qualification of the one that will be redeeming praise the lord but i i was looking at the the the lord of redemption just looking a few uh uh notes on that uh uh and then i i kind of throw that one in now let's go back to the book of numbers chapter 3. let's go back to the book of numbers chapter 3 praise the lord and uh and and the reason why i want to go into this is the other sometimes and many times as as as believers as christians as people that stayed around church go to church believe in god we turn now to appreciate what forgiveness is praise the lord amen that's right we term now to appreciate what forgiveness is it become a slogan sometimes for us jesus died on the cross my sins are forgiving but if you look at it as we will look at it a little bit tonight you will realize that god cannot be a just god praise the lord to forgive a man or a woman when they do wrong god cannot be a just god because when you talk about justice a price have to be paid right that's right so for the person to do wrong and you are just forgiving it's not justice are you are you with me tonight praise the lord if i just run around the tree and you can't see me i'm still here praise the lord for the person to do wrong i repeat myself and just be forgiving that's not justice so forgiveness comes with a price that's right brother yes it comes with a price thank you jesus are we together and it's it's hitting on the lord of redemption so we want to look at that a little bit tonight literally to god amen number chap numbers chapter 12. we'll go back it will take us all the way back to to to egypt when almighty god remember his promise that he gave to our father abraham he's seven how he will come down with the mighty hands and he will bring israel out of the land of egypt and we know the story when god came down and uh and displayed himself in all of those plagues that came upon the egyptians we know the last flag was where god was requiring the life of all the firstborn praise the lord he was requiring the life of all the firstborn the firstborn of the egyptians and the firstborn of the hebrews he was requiring the life of all the firstborn are we together but for the hebrews first born he gave them a substitute he told he told them to take a lamb kill the lamb and put the blood of the lamb on the doorpost i don't care if you were born of the tribe of benjamin or the tribe of of of of of joseph or the tribe whatever tribe you were born of i don't care if you were second size on the eighth day i don't care if you have kept all the commandments of god if that household refused to kill the lamb and put the blood on the doorpost the firstborn of that house was going to die just like an egyptian firstborn so god was requiring the life of all the firstborn many times we think that it was the egyptian firstborn but he was requiring the life of every firstborn because god himself he's the firstborn [Laughter] he gave birth to himself yes he's at firstborn praise the lord and we know the story how the death angel came and when the deaf angels saw the first born that was represented on that door post he back up praise the lord so for god to spare the firstborn of the hebrews he had to pay the price are we together now so after the egyptians saw i mean every house every house was weeping every house was broken even the house of pharaoh and when god brought the churn of israel out into the wilderness then he turned to the elders of israel through the prophet moses and he said to them that i spare your firstborn now because they had a special birth praise the lord now because they were born in a special city or at a special hospital i spare your firstborn because all firstborn are mine and he established with moses and the elders of israel that every firstborn will be given to him praise the lord now so you see god told him to put the blood on the doorpost he told them the death angel was coming he told them he was going to distract the firstborn and everything and and and and that they saw the miracle of god they saw the hand of god they saw the protection of god they saw how god moving and took them open the rear seat and everything praise the lord and all of these wonderful things that god was doing for them providing for them in the wilderness and bringing them out i mean those people were walking on their feet they were hearing the sounds of the cherubs behind him praise the lord and those chairs were brand new cherish the best terror in the world at that time because egypt was like a superpower but yet they could not meet up to people walking on their feet why because god was walking with them we could all we could talk about speed [Laughter] we could talk about speed the same way that uh elijah could not make it with ahab right elijah was walking and air was in his chair but yet ahab could not catch up with elijah before he got there elijah was waiting for him you see i've been here almost two hours waiting for you buddy glory be to god amen amen now saul this was established with israel that every first born will be given to the lord so with that being said over the time god established with israel let's read here the numbers chapter 3 verse 11 and the law speaks unto moses saying and i behold i have taken the levites from among the children of israel instead of the firstborn thou openeth the military among the children of israel therefore the levi shall be mine because all the firstborn are mine for all that they that are smart all the firstborn in the land of egypt are hollow on unto me all the firstborn in israel both first born both men and beasts mine shall they be i am the lord praise the lord now so god this telling uh uh uh moses he have he have taken these uh uh uh uh people the the levites and and and and that is the reason why the levites did not had inheritance because the levites belong to the lord okay but you will see it as you read them because god took the levite and said because i've taken the levite instead of the the firstborn did not mean that the firstborn were freed and the firstborn were no more gods no what happened is that as you read in exit and in other places you realize that this thing was established called the redemption money the redemption money so uh a family will come and and pay that's the reason why the redemption money was given to the levites because god now has taken the levites on behalf of the firstborn praise the lord amen amen so the the the the the redemption money a family would come and and whatever was required they would come and pay that money over to to to the tabernacle and it would be given to the levites and uh uh and and on and on it was something that was done all you know uh all through the time of israel but you realize here that word that language that paul used in ephesians talking about the earnest of our inheritance goes back to the redemption money praise the lord amen so just like i said have you ever heard the saying that says freedom is not free praise the lord and people would abuse it the people that abuse it they don't have no idea what really freedom is praise the lord if people knew what it cost for us to be living in a free country and don't have the government spotting on every family praise the lord tracing your child breath and controlling your wages and controlling how many children you can have and how much you can own and what everything you can own sometimes people don't have no idea praise the lord amen that's the reason why they want everything free because they think freedom is free they want the government to pay the house rent the government to do this for them the government to do that for them and and i mean the system has been so abused because people think that freedom is free all of those things was where were put in place for people that were in need to benefit from it praise the lord and you know as i was as i was i was telling i was really uh uh looking into some things and listening to some things i realized that even the government our present day the modern day government around the world has become so corrupt that the government i'm trying to look for the word not a political correct word but a right word amen i don't want to be politically correct i just want to say the right thing the government enjoy let me let me say it this way they love when there is social crisis because it has always been a way that a corrupt government has always used to bring more laws either to control the people or to introduce a weight off eat up more spending because for them to be able to to steal they have to just create the money it looks like there is more money there for more things to be done but what i'm talking about tonight is that because if you even look at this this lord on the redemption year of the redemption money the same thing was used on a corrupt church system the catholic church used that oh yeah when they have people paying money for souls to be prey out of purgatory but what we're talking about tonight is for us to be able to appreciate when you think that i'm forgiving it came with a prize praise the lord it came with a prize because you have to realize that if if there is no price to it it would temper with god justice right that's right sure praise the lord because the lord of god which is a law is a law that is in nature whatever you saw that you will reap it's a law that is in nature you don't put a mango seeds to the ground and get oranges right praise the lord now so it helped us to be able to look at that and uh you know and and appreciate that someone took our place amen for you to be able to appreciate your forgiveness like the old saying that said the pattern is not a pattern until it has been accepted as a pattern praise the lord but don't you have haven't you seen it sometimes with people maybe family member or so and then you're i mean just a talk of uh and you say it's uh well okay i forget about it you know i forgive you and that person had no remorse no sense to even accept it praise the lord it's because there is a there is a misunderstanding of that word forgiveness people just think they are the you know it's one of those things you know uh uh freely giving that is freely given to us well yeah it's freely giving you don't have to work for it you don't have to pay for it but somebody paid for it there was a price praise the lord now it's almost like if you go to the neighbor house you take that we borrow or you take something from the neighbor what are the the hulk or the rake or whatever it is and then they give it to you and and and and you have no sense to realize that this person paid money for this well that's that's my neighbor we are good bodies you know he borrowed my thing i bought his and and and then you just you just destroy it praise the lord but just for you to put in the back of your mind i don't know how much he paid for it could be a dime or it could be 200 so what whatever he pay for but to put at the back of your mind that he paid something for this realizing that there was a price that was paid it makes you to cherish it it makes you to take care of it praise the lord and that is the same thing with christian life today because people do not pop the prize that was paid for their forgiveness they don't cherish their christian life they just think that well i can pray god will forgive me i go back and commit sin i can pray you know he's a loving god he will forgive me they don't cherish it yes sir brother yes sir you just run in and out of sin and just live in a kind of a life because he's a loving god he's a you know he's a forgiving father but he don't realize that every time that god will forgive a man he had to look to the price that's right that was paid right praise the lord do you know that's the reason why the near sky body of jesus sat at the right hand of the father as a memorial because that was the price praise the lord just like how israel kept the body of joseph asa memorial when joseph died they embalmed him and they kept his body as a memorial his body reminded them that one of these days we will be out of here yeah because joseph told them don't bury him in here that's right that's right that's right and he's a type of christ amen are we together praise the lord now so my mind is just all over the place bear with me now praise the lord amen glory be to god there is a price because sin cannot go unpunished no sin cannot go to punish and you see the thing about the good lord is that when our father adam and eve sinned in the garden of eden we know that god drove them from the garden praise the lord but before he drove them out of the garden he dead with sin right in the garden that's right that's right praise the lord he dared with it right there right he he spoke to adam he spoke to eve that's god's justice that sin cannot go unpunished praise the lord and do you know that's the reason why there will have to be a general resurrection sure because all sin was committed here on earth god is not going to join sin in heaven it was committed right here so the white turned judgment is going to be right here on earth because that's god's justice praise the lord that's his justice so when they are going there when the apostle paul says there is no condemnation to them that are in christ when jesus said he that believer remain is passed from death unto life something has taken place praise the lord what am i talking to now where where am i driving you uh this this prayer meeting night it's learning to appreciate that's right our forgiveness a man and a woman that learn to appreciate being forgiving it puts you to the place where paul says there is no condemnation it is not that also that there is no condemnation that you are not condemned but you don't even have condemnation in your heart for anybody you don't feel condemned and it's not so easy for you to condemn another person sure praise the lord well if you leave it with man they want all of god's mercy and all of god's forgiveness but the next guy lord you judge him you deal with him for me my own sin was not too big praise the lord thank you if you appreciate it for many of our children born in the faith parents drag us to church from small we look around our shoulder and then we ask ourselves what sin have i done praise the lord that's why many young people around the church around the message they don't appreciate the grace that has come to them praise the lord because they keep asking i said well wrong have i done they think that they have to go and get themselves in some kind of a trouble praise the lord either run around and and and and mess with friends and you know and and and get ourselves into crazy thing on drugs or wrong with boys and and you know and and and get pregnant or something like that sure to be able to experience god's forgiveness right from your birth praise the lord like david said in sin did my mother conceive me praise the lord when we were born into this world we were born seen us we were born under the law of sin glory be to god you see that's the reason why uh uh you know uh since you can you can really put yourself to the place to claim and think that you are doing something for god right praise the lord amen for one to really come to the place and think that i'm doing something for the lord it's a it's a little bit awful sin of pride that gets under the flesh sure what the jesus said in saint john chapter 6 they came unto him and said lord how can we do the greater works praise the lord they said they said master how can we do the greater works he said for you to do the greater works you have to believe believe on him whom was saying oh how it's so hard to do that one praise the lord amen it's so hard to do that because that word belief runs deep it means to trust remember the scripture there says it did not only say believe they say believe on believe on him whom was seen it's a word that has a sense of to trust to put into his hands not just believe as a mental conception because many believe just as a mental conception i believe god i know he died for my sin but they have not trusted himself into his hands that's the same thing that uh peter said to the the philippian jail or peter or paul believe on the lord jesus believe on ye and your household will be saved glory be to god praise the lord amen you know sunday i was talking about making love with jesus praise the lord oh i just i just enjoyed our worship after the service on sunday it just i mean it just took everything out of me praise the lord that's the thing my heart longed for praise the lord you know just like david said in this time how he used his pillows and he hugged his pillows and he went until his pillows were not only wet with tears they would stink of tears a little bit to god now so ah okay i'll soon leave you so we can go home tonight uh i know many of you traveling um down to washington we will be praying for you so uh you know i was i was thinking about this this just crossed my mind today as i was i was uh meditating and i i just i went back and looked at a few scriptures tonight i says wow yeah and that the thing that was that was that was really hitting me in the top was how much do we appreciate being forgiving it's not what you say it's your attitude it's your attitude praise the lord amen that's the reason why in the gospel jesus gave that parable where the king has to to to throw that man in prison because he was forgiving of his debts but he could not forgive his neighbor down the street that had just had a little debt when he had a big debt praise the law so you see it was his attitude no matter what he what he told the king oh thank you you are so gracious you know you you're so kind to me thank you my wife and my children i mean we will save you the rest of our life sure no matter what he said but it was his attitude when he went away praise the lord forgiveness is something that affects the believer's attitude because it's not only there to forgive you of the odd but it's to free you from guilt [Music] it's a word that freed the believer from guilt you don't have to look over your shoulders you don't have to fuss at people when they say well you know you did that before you don't have to fuss back praise the lord what are you fighting for you are already forgiving praise the lord you know that's what the devil does he's just coming and remind you of all you uh you have done just to put you in a fighting black move praise the lord because he knows the purpose of forgiving is not just so you can hold attack on you it's for you to be justified not just coming on a status but it's an experience that frees you from guilt it delivers you from haunting memories praise the lord because you know if it was just i mean just just a vic word if it was just a sentence that was said you are forgiving right but it comes it brings it brings the sin of a price that was paid it makes you to ever be grateful that someone took your place there is no room for a little eye than a big you there is no room of throwing your shoulders man uh i don't want to go into that tonight but it kind of blew my mind i was looking at something here in the scripture and it just blew my mind and i've been i've been studying on that a little bit where god says jacob i love and easer i hate that's a very strong word that's a very strong word let me take you down that road a little bit you will realize that god told rebecca of the two sons that was in her womb praise the lord and you were even realized that all the time that isa and jacob i mean jacob uh uh esau saw his uh birthright he you know he took the politician you know and and jacob came and disguised himself and and his father blessing and all of that you will realize that in genesis read the story about israel and jacob in genesis god never mentioned in genesis it's now stated there in genesis jacob i love israel i hate that statement came years down the road it came years down the road and the root cause for that sickness was pride when when easter realized that his father has given all the blessing to jacob the bible says he went and took a canaanite woman because he wanted to get back to his parents sure out of pride so if you look back and you realize that we will get into that when you realized that you would realize that what god hated was not the child easer it was a pride that went with his generation the act was committed in genesis and it was in malachi that god expressed jacob i love in easter i hate you love the lord tonight praise the lord freedom is not free for you to appreciate your forgiveness you have to keep the price in mind you have to always keep the price in mind the worshiper is never on our examination it's a sacrifice that is honor examination musicians you can come tonight let's just buy our heads to the lord and begin to praise him and appreciate him let's just pray together let's thank the lord over there in the book of trinity paul talked about in the last day how people will be very unthankful and we're living in a generation where people have no sense of really being thankful because there's a generation that is seeking entitlement living in a generation where people think they are entitled they have a right they gotta fight for every right because they are entitled their sense of entitledness is taking gratefulness from the society because if you are entitled to it why should you be thankful it's for you anyway so the expression of thankfulness gratefulness and people were always both how they work to buy themselves a house and and and and i labored and i saved them money and then you know i studied hard to get a good job and and you know and and it's just it's just entitlement it's just entitlement and because of that people are not thankful no matter what you do did you see it for you to be thankful you have to go beyond the person for you to be appreciate forgiveness you got to keep the price in mind for you to appreciate freedom you got to think about the man that lose their lives old church young children if we can bring thanks to god when we say lord i thank you and we don't know what we are saying if we just say lord i thank you if you don't know what you are saying oh praise the lord tonight praise the lord tonight praise the lord tonight he became me let's play that song blessed be the name of the

more like that was sacrificing their children and giving their first born to the fire do you know that it came under that same thought praise the lord you see how the devil can just take one principle of god without the truth without the reality he can just take a word a sentence i mean that's how many false doctrine has been you know around the world just one sentence [Music] and the doctrine is made out of faith praise the lord we come to the new testament and paul taught us that christ is the firstborn among many brethrens amen even when god asks abraham to offer to offer of his first bond which of course that was his first born by promise praise the lord you have to realize that when god achieved what he wanted because what he wanted was not isaac what he wanted was the heart of abraham praise the lord he wanted to see how much thankful abraham was if you are really thankful abraham give me your first ball [Music] as soon as god achieved that he cut it off he said don't do it
