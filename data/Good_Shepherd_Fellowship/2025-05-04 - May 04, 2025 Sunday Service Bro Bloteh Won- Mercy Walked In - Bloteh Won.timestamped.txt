[59:53] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Thank you.
[59:57] Amen. Let's take our
[1:00:00] Bibles. You see why there I go through
[1:00:04] what I wanted to speak about.
[1:00:08] Because when you when you start to think
[1:00:10] about God's mercy and you start to sing
[1:00:14] about God's mercy and start to remember
[1:00:17] where mercy formed you and uh
[1:00:21] uh I mean everything stands still. Amen.
[1:00:26] Everything stands still. Everything in
[1:00:28] your life, everything around your life
[1:00:30] stands still because uh uh that's that's
[1:00:34] a glorious moment.
[1:00:36] Praise the Lord. Genesis chapter
[1:00:53] 3. Genesis chapter 3.
[1:01:06] Let's read from verse
[1:01:08] 8. Genesis chapter 3. Let's read from
[1:01:11] verse
[1:01:15] 8. And they heard the voice of the Lord
[1:01:18] God
[1:01:20] walking in the garden in the cold of the
[1:01:23] day.
[1:01:25] And Adam and his wife hid himself from
[1:01:29] the presence of the
[1:01:30] Lord among the trees in the garden. And
[1:01:34] the Lord God called unto
[1:01:39] Adam, and said unto him, Where art
[1:01:43] thou? And he said, I have heard thy
[1:01:46] voice in the garden, and I was afraid
[1:01:50] because I was naked, and I hid myself.
[1:01:59] And he said, "Who told thee that thou
[1:02:01] were naked? Have thou eaten the tree
[1:02:03] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:02:05] should not
[1:02:09] eat?" Praise the
[1:02:13] Lord.
[1:02:18] Amen. Let's read Lamentation.
[1:02:22] The Lamentation of Jeremiah, chapter 3.
[1:02:26] That would be right after the book of
[1:02:28] Jeremiah.
[1:02:53] Lamentation chapter 3 let's read verse
[1:03:09] 21. See the way I mean Jeremiah placed
[1:03:12] this.
[1:03:14] He says this I recall to my
[1:03:17] mind therefore have I hope. What did he
[1:03:22] recall to his mind? Whenever you think
[1:03:25] about
[1:03:26] mercy, whenever you
[1:03:29] recall how God has been merciful to you,
[1:03:33] you can have hope for another day.
[1:03:37] Praise the Lord. If you come to the
[1:03:40] realization that it took his mercy to
[1:03:43] bring you this far, if that becomes real
[1:03:47] to you, then you can have hope. He says,
[1:03:51] "This I recall to my mind, therefore
[1:03:55] have I hope."
[1:03:59] It is of the Lord's
[1:04:01] mercy that we are not
[1:04:04] consumed because his compassion fileth
[1:04:09] not. They I knew every
[1:04:12] morning great is thy faithfulness. Let's
[1:04:17] pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord, I
[1:04:20] would just throw myself in your hands
[1:04:22] and also commit the people to you, oh
[1:04:25] God, that Lord, you will come, Father,
[1:04:27] Lord, and and take your word, oh God,
[1:04:29] and just speak to us, Lord. Oh, Father
[1:04:32] God, may something be said, Lord, that
[1:04:35] would draw us closer in our walk, oh
[1:04:38] God. Father, may something, oh God.
[1:04:40] Lord, make mercy more real to us than
[1:04:44] ever before. I pray to God that father
[1:04:46] your grace will just come and help us
[1:04:49] now. To you be the praise, to you be the
[1:04:52] glory and honor. In the name of the Lord
[1:04:54] Jesus we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord
[1:04:58] bless you. You may have your
[1:05:00] seat. Now at at first I never thought,
[1:05:04] you know, we were going to have a
[1:05:06] special speaker on uh on uh uh on Easter
[1:05:10] weekend. like like I said uh you know we
[1:05:13] contacted
[1:05:14] brother Crosby when we heard he was in
[1:05:17] the country to do uh a wedding so we we
[1:05:21] made contact with him and that's how we
[1:05:23] got in but before we got in uh I was
[1:05:27] thinking u uh on what I was going to
[1:05:29] speak if it will have fall on my lot to
[1:05:32] preach on uh on Easter what was I going
[1:05:34] to talk about so uh I had uh I was
[1:05:39] actually going to speak
[1:05:41] on on
[1:05:43] Barabas. I want to speak on Barabas.
[1:05:47] Uh been doing a couple of reading on
[1:05:50] Barabas. The character Barabas caught my
[1:05:53] attention and uh so uh I was going to
[1:05:57] I'm going to title my message Barabas.
[1:05:59] Now seeing that I didn't speak on
[1:06:03] Easter. So I was saying okay I have to
[1:06:06] find a time to be able to bring this
[1:06:08] message. So as I was thinking on what I
[1:06:11] was going to speak, even though that was
[1:06:12] not what was on my mind and uh uh
[1:06:19] uh when when my thought actually
[1:06:23] uh changed into what I want to speak
[1:06:26] about this morning and uh which of
[1:06:28] course I use the title of the song to
[1:06:31] tie to my message mercy walk
[1:06:35] in. So uh uh this is what attracted me
[1:06:39] to want to speak on that uh
[1:06:44] uh on that message of Barbash.
[1:06:48] If you look uh uh I will read this quote
[1:06:50] from you to you from the message uh God
[1:06:53] wrapped
[1:06:54] gift and uh
[1:06:59] uh when brother Brandon was preaching
[1:07:01] that message he said this. He
[1:07:06] said to an infane
[1:07:09] woman to a condemned
[1:07:14] barabash he revealed
[1:07:17] himself. So I was I was uh you know I
[1:07:22] was listening to series of message or
[1:07:24] like I try to do uh most every time and
[1:07:29] uh uh god rob gift was one of the
[1:07:31] message I was listening to and then when
[1:07:34] when that when that thought came across
[1:07:37] uh uh
[1:07:39] uh the
[1:07:42] tape I actually paused the tape and I I
[1:07:45] went back you know and I started paying
[1:07:48] attention
[1:07:49] to that and and because it was it has it
[1:07:52] has already fall in line with what my
[1:07:55] inspiration about Barabas was and uh uh
[1:08:00] because there's a there's a legend
[1:08:02] there's a story that that that speaks of
[1:08:07] Barabas that after he was released
[1:08:11] uh
[1:08:14] uh right from the beginning he was he
[1:08:17] was very
[1:08:18] confused because he knew that uh his
[1:08:22] offense was a capital
[1:08:26] punishment. Okay? He knew that his
[1:08:29] offense was a capital punishment. He
[1:08:31] knew that uh he was going to die. He was
[1:08:35] condemned to die because in Mark chapter
[1:08:38] 15, the Bible let us to know that uh uh
[1:08:45] uh Barabas
[1:08:53] uh was involved in an
[1:08:56] insurrection and uh uh and in that
[1:08:59] insurrection he uh he he murdered a man
[1:09:03] and and it's it's is told that this man
[1:09:05] that he murdered was uh was a Roman
[1:09:08] soldier. So uh uh he had a penalty of
[1:09:12] death over his
[1:09:14] head.
[1:09:16] So Barabas knowing there he's going to
[1:09:20] die, you know. And uh God bless
[1:09:23] you. God bless you. Okay. And uh
[1:09:27] congratulate congratulation again. Uh
[1:09:30] brother Belly had his graduation in the
[1:09:32] week. So uh we thank the Lord for taking
[1:09:35] him through that phase of school. Amen.
[1:09:38] That phase of his
[1:09:40] life now. So uh uh knowing that he had
[1:09:44] that thing hanging over his
[1:09:47] life, all he could be thinking in his
[1:09:51] mind was all that he ever did to get to
[1:09:55] this place. He could never think about
[1:09:58] preparing for any future because he know
[1:10:01] he was condemned to die.
[1:10:04] If he was thinking about everything, he
[1:10:06] would think about his loved ones. He
[1:10:08] would think about growing up. He would
[1:10:10] think about having fun. It was all in
[1:10:12] the past. His past became his hero. He
[1:10:16] never had a future because he was
[1:10:18] condemned to
[1:10:20] die. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:24] And uh so
[1:10:29] uh but for Barabas to receive uh uh uh
[1:10:35] uh a
[1:10:38] pardon and his pardon was not announced
[1:10:42] to him for him to prepare to walk into
[1:10:46] his pardon. his pardon came to him as a
[1:10:52] surprise because if you remember the
[1:10:54] story uh it was right there uh uh uh you
[1:10:58] know after uh Kai said we have no king
[1:11:03] but Caesar and uh uh and you know and
[1:11:06] and Pilate has gone back and forth and
[1:11:09] and trying to convince them I I see no
[1:11:12] wrong in this man and uh uh and and yet
[1:11:16] the people continued to cry crucify him
[1:11:20] and uh and and and Pilate will yield to
[1:11:23] their Lord at that time of the feast
[1:11:25] that one man should be released. So he
[1:11:27] thought he could convince them even
[1:11:30] though you want this man to be killed by
[1:11:33] calling to the Lord and according to
[1:11:35] your feast. Why not I gave you this man
[1:11:38] as the release man? They said no
[1:11:42] crucified him but give us Barabas.
[1:11:46] Barabas never heard nothing like that
[1:11:49] because he was in the
[1:11:51] dungeon. Amen. The people chanting gave
[1:11:55] us Barabas. He never heard it. If he
[1:11:58] would have heard it, it would have given
[1:11:59] you some sense of
[1:12:02] hope. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:06] He never heard it. And he was just there
[1:12:10] counting the days. He knew that when he
[1:12:13] hear the Roman soldiers stepping down
[1:12:16] those steps and getting down in the
[1:12:18] dungeon to get him out, he knew that his
[1:12:21] days were
[1:12:23] over. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:28] So, brother Brandon was said a little
[1:12:30] bit like this in God's
[1:12:36] robbas must have failed that vain. You
[1:12:40] know Barabas the story. Barabas is that
[1:12:46] uh
[1:12:47] outlaw that was caught. He was put down
[1:12:52] in a
[1:12:52] gallet was going to die the next
[1:12:55] morning. He was a thief. He was an
[1:12:58] outlaw. He was a murderer. A criminal.
[1:13:02] And all night long he walked up and down
[1:13:06] the jail pulling his
[1:13:09] head. For the next
[1:13:13] morning he went to the cross. Capital
[1:13:15] punishment. He would
[1:13:18] die.
[1:13:19] How the nightmare passed over him that
[1:13:23] night. How he couldn't rest. He couldn't
[1:13:26] even sleep because all he was thinking
[1:13:29] about was he was going to
[1:13:32] die and
[1:13:35] crucification
[1:13:37] was just it was the death
[1:13:40] penitent and because the the history
[1:13:44] will say uh the it was the the the the
[1:13:47] Persian that that really started
[1:13:49] crucification. When you read in the book
[1:13:52] of Esther where it says that Hermet went
[1:13:55] and make a gallop to hanker
[1:13:58] Modi that that was where crucification
[1:14:01] came
[1:14:02] from. Actually what he was going to do
[1:14:05] he was going to crucify uh Machi. And so
[1:14:09] the Roman took to them because uh uh in
[1:14:12] that way they could make
[1:14:16] uh uh the criminal feed the pain of
[1:14:19] death.
[1:14:20] Instead of just killing them
[1:14:22] immediately, they make them to feel the
[1:14:24] pain of death. They groan in agony and
[1:14:28] they see, you know, their life slowly
[1:14:31] leaving their
[1:14:33] body. And uh so and you think about
[1:14:38] there that uh uh that this man were
[1:14:40] facing that kind of a death, he would
[1:14:42] not sleep. I mean food does not have
[1:14:46] taste in the mouth of a man that know
[1:14:48] he's going to face that kind of a death.
[1:14:51] Praise the Lord. A young man, he had his
[1:14:55] whole future before
[1:14:57] him and yet he was condemned to
[1:15:01] die. You
[1:15:03] think what was the thought that went
[1:15:06] through his mind? Brother Brandon will
[1:15:09] continue the next morning. No breakfast
[1:15:11] or nothing, nor in his blood will be
[1:15:15] staunched out like among
[1:15:18] wolves. All at once he
[1:15:21] hear the chains the gate
[1:15:27] opening and he hear the soldiers, the
[1:15:30] trampling of the soldiers. and year come
[1:15:33] four or
[1:15:34] five battalion of the Roman soldiers
[1:15:37] spears in their hand walking up
[1:15:40] there the big jailer turn to kill Ke and
[1:15:44] he walked
[1:15:45] out
[1:15:47] Barabas he said oh don't kill me have
[1:15:52] mercy he said Barabas there is nothing
[1:15:55] wrong you are
[1:15:57] free praise the Lord now you think about
[1:16:02] how how did he process that?
[1:16:06] Amen. How did he
[1:16:09] process
[1:16:11] hearing you are
[1:16:13] free?
[1:16:15] Amen. Am I free to run so they can shoot
[1:16:20] me? Am I free to run into my
[1:16:24] death? Praise the Lord.
[1:16:41] You are free. How did I come freed?
[1:16:43] Somebody somebody pointed up that uh uh
[1:16:48] up that
[1:16:50] way. what it must have meant to Barabas
[1:16:54] when he seen the gift that took his
[1:16:57] place in
[1:17:00] death. I felt the same
[1:17:03] way God gift took my place in
[1:17:08] death.
[1:17:10] How that dying teeth on the cross nailed
[1:17:15] up there. Praise the Lord. Amen. So to
[1:17:20] just think about it, to just, you know,
[1:17:23] think about it that way that
[1:17:27] uh
[1:17:35] uh and the amazing thing also as I was
[1:17:38] thinking about the subject is that if
[1:17:41] you remember one time we talked about uh
[1:17:44] the giver uh uh the maker and the giver
[1:17:48] of names.
[1:17:49] And uh and we took the name of
[1:17:51] Barabbash. Uh
[1:17:54] uh and then because if you look at the
[1:17:56] name of
[1:17:58] Barabash, it really
[1:18:01] means Baraba means the son of a father,
[1:18:05] the son of the father.
[1:18:09] And uh
[1:18:11] uh if you go back and and you study some
[1:18:15] of uh the Jewish writing, they would
[1:18:17] tell you that uh
[1:18:22] uh that his full name was Jesus
[1:18:28] Barabas. They would tell you that his
[1:18:30] full name was Jesus Barabas. You see, we
[1:18:34] we have this place in
[1:18:36] us when we think about the
[1:18:40] crucification and
[1:18:42] uh because the people
[1:18:45] cry, "Give us Barabas, crucify Jesus."
[1:18:50] We have the tendency to take on
[1:18:53] Barabash as if he was the one that
[1:18:57] caused the death of Jesus. And we really
[1:19:00] don't see ourself at a place that it was
[1:19:04] because of our
[1:19:05] sin that he went to the
[1:19:08] cross. Praise the
[1:19:11] Lord. Barabas was a representation of
[1:19:14] every one of
[1:19:16] us. We were all condemned to die. We
[1:19:20] were all one way or the another a
[1:19:24] barabash either by our birth in sin, our
[1:19:28] sin nature, our attitude and the things
[1:19:31] that we know that we are guilty of. We
[1:19:34] were all
[1:19:37] barabas. Praise the Lord. But look at
[1:19:40] the beauty here. The Bible says Caiaphas
[1:19:43] prophesied when he said before Pilate
[1:19:46] according to our law this time of the
[1:19:48] feast one man should give his life for
[1:19:51] all. And he did not even know that he
[1:19:53] was prophesying. He was right line the
[1:19:56] scripture. Yeah. There was a man that
[1:19:58] would give his life for all. Amen. And
[1:20:02] then and then uh uh uh uh he said we
[1:20:07] have no king but Caesar. So you can see
[1:20:10] his uh his rejection for this man. Amen.
[1:20:15] His rejection for the Lord Jesus. And he
[1:20:19] really want this man to to to to die. He
[1:20:22] has just prophesied that there is there
[1:20:25] should be a man that should give his
[1:20:27] life for all. This is the man that is
[1:20:30] going to give his life for all. The very
[1:20:32] man that is going to be the sacrifice
[1:20:35] for for for Adam fallen race. He's
[1:20:38] rejecting that man with a kind of a
[1:20:41] religious
[1:20:43] hatred. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:47] But yet look at it again. They are
[1:20:50] crying give us Barabas. When you
[1:20:54] actually take they are crying in a
[1:20:56] literal sense. They are saying give us
[1:20:59] the son of the
[1:21:02] father. Praise the lord. But the son of
[1:21:06] the father that they are asking for is
[1:21:08] not the son of the heavenly father.
[1:21:11] Praise the lord.
[1:21:14] He's prophesying that one man should
[1:21:16] give his life for all. The one that
[1:21:20] should give his life. He's rejecting
[1:21:22] that one. Praise the Lord. This is the
[1:21:25] one that we want crucified.
[1:21:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Do you see
[1:21:35] how God's
[1:21:38] mercy walks in even when we don't want
[1:21:41] it?
[1:21:44] Praise the Lord. When we
[1:21:47] become arrogant and we become
[1:21:51] ignorant, he's putting up all of his
[1:21:54] religious
[1:21:57] muscles. He's the high priest. He's the
[1:22:00] man that the people looked to. He's
[1:22:04] defending them before Pilate and trying
[1:22:06] to see why this man must be
[1:22:10] crucified. Praise the Lord. But yet
[1:22:16] mercy, God's mercy is squeezing through
[1:22:19] the crack of his ignorance.
[1:22:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:27] Are we together?
[1:22:31] So that's what I was thinking
[1:22:34] about that drew me to
[1:22:36] this. And like I said, this statement
[1:22:39] caught my mind to the
[1:22:43] infin condemned
[1:22:45] Barabas. He revealed
[1:22:47] himself. Jesus revealed himself. Praise
[1:22:51] the Lord. The people cried, "Give us
[1:22:54] Barabas. Crucify him." Barbara's coming
[1:22:58] out of his death
[1:23:02] sentence. He got
[1:23:07] convicted. This man that is taking my
[1:23:10] place, what did he
[1:23:13] do? What is his crime? What kind of a
[1:23:17] crime have he committed that can be so
[1:23:19] greater than my my crime that he's
[1:23:22] taking my place?
[1:23:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:28] And all they could say is that he
[1:23:30] claimed to be the son of
[1:23:33] God. He called himself the
[1:23:36] Messiah. Is it not what the Lord says
[1:23:39] the Messiah will
[1:23:42] do? Praise the Lord.
[1:23:47] So you can just see what it is. What a
[1:23:51] haunting thought that went with Barabas
[1:23:55] the rest of his life.
[1:24:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:04] That the man that is taking his place
[1:24:06] never killed. He never he never fought
[1:24:09] against the Roman government. He never
[1:24:11] did anything. The only thing that he
[1:24:14] did is that he called
[1:24:18] himself the son of
[1:24:22] God. And some will say he opened the
[1:24:24] eyes of blind by
[1:24:26] Timoth. And some would say he was the
[1:24:29] one that raised up Jara's
[1:24:35] daughter. A woman with a blood issue
[1:24:37] touched
[1:24:38] him and she got well. Was that his crime
[1:24:42] for him to take my place?
[1:24:46] But that's what happened when mercy
[1:24:50] walks in.
[1:24:54] Praise the
[1:24:55] Lord. That's what happen when
[1:24:59] mercy walks
[1:25:02] in. But how many times do we recognize
[1:25:05] it?
[1:25:07] When mercy is right standing before our
[1:25:12] face, we're trying to defend our
[1:25:15] religious position. We're trying to
[1:25:17] defend uh uh uh you know uh the wrong
[1:25:20] that we have done, the the the reason
[1:25:22] why we did it and and the the the right
[1:25:24] that we have to do what we
[1:25:31] did. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:35] Are we
[1:25:41] together? When you go back just like we
[1:25:44] read there in Genesis chapter 3, the
[1:25:46] Bible says the voice of
[1:25:47] God was walking in the garden and that
[1:25:50] voice came
[1:25:53] walking. When our father Adam and our
[1:25:57] mother Eve has broke the commandment of
[1:26:00] God, praise the
[1:26:02] Lord. God has instructed
[1:26:06] them and they had brought the word of
[1:26:10] God.
[1:26:12] Amen. And in their
[1:26:15] guilt, they were trying to find the God
[1:26:19] fake leaves for themsel and and and and
[1:26:21] and cover their shame and and they were
[1:26:24] trying to find a place to
[1:26:27] hide. But see what the Bible says. The
[1:26:30] voice of
[1:26:32] God came
[1:26:34] walking. And what I want us to realize
[1:26:37] is that that voice of God was
[1:26:42] mercy that came
[1:26:44] walking in their fallen
[1:26:49] situation. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:53] Amen.
[1:26:56] Mercy took on a
[1:26:58] form and it could hear the footsteps of
[1:27:05] mercy. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:10] Many of the times when we do things that
[1:27:12] is wrong and your you you feel
[1:27:18] guilty, your heart start to race and and
[1:27:21] sometimes your heart beats so fast that
[1:27:24] you can hear the sound of of the beating
[1:27:26] of your heart. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:34] But when the grace of God comes in and
[1:27:36] God will make a provision and he will do
[1:27:39] something to bring you out of that
[1:27:41] situation. Many of the time we hear the
[1:27:45] footsteps of judgment and
[1:27:48] condemnation fear us. We we we are
[1:27:51] afraid and and we we are scaring what is
[1:27:53] going to happen. Our name is going to
[1:27:55] spawn and all of that. You know, we we
[1:27:57] hear out of the sound, but when mercy
[1:28:00] steps in, praise the Lord.
[1:28:05] Not many times we are tuned to hear the
[1:28:08] first step of mercy.
[1:28:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:16] But Adam being the son of God and and
[1:28:19] and and one that was uh always in the
[1:28:22] presence of God, he heard the Bible said
[1:28:26] there is no way that uh uh uh uh uh God
[1:28:29] would describe it that way if Adam never
[1:28:32] heard a footstep coming his
[1:28:35] way. He heard the voice of God walking
[1:28:39] in the
[1:28:40] garden saying, "Adam, Adam, where are
[1:28:44] you?" Like I always say, it's not that
[1:28:46] God was really looking for Adam or God
[1:28:50] never knew where Adam was, but God
[1:28:52] wanted to know if Adam really knew where
[1:28:54] he was.
[1:28:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:01] Amen. Because God knows where you are.
[1:29:04] He knows where your mind and your heart
[1:29:07] is this morning. But do you actually
[1:29:10] know where you are? I'm not talking
[1:29:12] about this building.
[1:29:15] Amen. I'm talking about where you are
[1:29:18] spiritually.
[1:29:23] Praise the Lord. Oh, he knows that
[1:29:25] address.
[1:29:27] Amen.
[1:29:29] Do you know where you are? What kind of
[1:29:31] a spirit you are hanging on?
[1:29:36] But he
[1:29:37] knows. And the moment he can get your
[1:29:40] attention to identify your
[1:29:43] address and you can work with him and
[1:29:46] accept, yeah, this is where I am. There
[1:29:48] mercy steps in because every time where
[1:29:51] mercy comes in,
[1:29:54] praise the Lord.
[1:30:00] If mercy steps in your
[1:30:02] situation, death has to step out. Amen.
[1:30:05] If mercy step in your situation,
[1:30:08] sickness have to step out. If mercy step
[1:30:11] in your situation, praise the Lord,
[1:30:14] everything that is contrary to the word
[1:30:16] of God had to step out.
[1:30:20] Are we
[1:30:26] together? Mercy walks right in
[1:30:30] there. And Adam said, "I hear your
[1:30:33] voice.
[1:30:34] and I hear
[1:30:35] myself. Praise the
[1:30:37] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] Like Bert Brandon said, God slayed a
[1:30:43] lamb on the east side of Eden and he was
[1:30:46] walking with a with a dripping blood of
[1:30:48] of of
[1:30:50] lambkin. While they were running to hide
[1:30:53] themselves, he was he was following
[1:30:54] them, going to meet them just where they
[1:30:56] are.
[1:31:05] Are we together?
[1:31:09] This mercy of God.
[1:31:15] Jeremiah said, "If I record in my
[1:31:18] mind, if I
[1:31:20] recall in my
[1:31:23] mind or this I record in my mind,
[1:31:26] therefore I have
[1:31:28] hope that it is the Lord's
[1:31:32] mercy that we are not
[1:31:35] consumed." Amen.
[1:31:38] because his
[1:31:40] compassion fadeth not that he has not
[1:31:44] consumed us in his
[1:31:46] mercy. Praise the
[1:31:48] Lord.
[1:31:51] Hallelujah. The Bible let us know he
[1:31:53] says here
[1:31:55] also they are renewed every
[1:31:58] morning. Praise the Lord. every morning.
[1:32:02] That's that is that is just uh uh uh
[1:32:07] uh a wonderful embrace that God is
[1:32:11] letting us
[1:32:13] know that when we break out of sleep and
[1:32:17] our eyes
[1:32:19] open mercy has just woke you up.
[1:32:26] Praise the
[1:32:27] Lord. That mercy has just woke you
[1:32:32] up. And God gave us new mercy every
[1:32:39] morning. What do we do with it? That
[1:32:43] would be the
[1:32:44] question. And you see, you can see all
[1:32:47] through the scripture. That's the thing
[1:32:49] that was going through my mind as I was
[1:32:51] thinking on this. You know, just see how
[1:32:53] God's mercy
[1:32:56] keep coming after us and running after
[1:32:59] us and trying to reconcile us to God.
[1:33:04] Praise the
[1:33:06] Lord. Amen.
[1:33:11] We have
[1:33:13] plans, you know, we make plans and and
[1:33:16] uh uh we plan our
[1:33:19] future, you know, we plan our career, we
[1:33:22] plan, you just, you know, we make
[1:33:25] plans. And the thing about it that is
[1:33:28] that
[1:33:33] uh I believe many of
[1:33:36] us we plan our future we prayed about it
[1:33:40] committed in the hands of the
[1:33:42] Lord but yet sometimes it's almost like
[1:33:46] uh
[1:33:47] uh for so
[1:33:50] many they're looking at the future
[1:33:53] they're looking at what they want to do
[1:33:55] the look at it in such a way that uh
[1:34:00] uh they rely on different abilities and
[1:34:04] provision and the very thing that that
[1:34:08] will have to bring them to their
[1:34:11] future they are not in contact with
[1:34:14] it. Praise the
[1:34:16] Lord. They are not in contact with
[1:34:24] it. But every day in our
[1:34:27] life, every morning like the scripture
[1:34:30] says, his mercy is renewed every
[1:34:33] morning. Every day if God would just
[1:34:37] take his mercy from us, we will not
[1:34:41] live. Amen. Just like the scripture says
[1:34:44] here, it is by his mercy that we are not
[1:34:46] consumed. So if we don't have mercy,
[1:34:49] definitely we will be
[1:34:52] consumed. Amen. Definitely we will be
[1:34:56] consumed. We will definitely be
[1:35:00] consumed. Only our thoughts is enough to
[1:35:03] consume
[1:35:05] us. The things that we imagine in our
[1:35:08] mind, the things we we feel on in our
[1:35:11] spirit is just enough to consume
[1:35:15] us. Praise the Lord. But the reason why
[1:35:19] we are not consumed is because of his
[1:35:23] mercy.
[1:35:26] Praise the
[1:35:27] Lord. Genesis chapter 6. Let's look
[1:35:30] there. Let's take on now because uh uh I
[1:35:35] need your
[1:35:47] help. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:51] The Bible will let us know in Genesis
[1:35:54] chapter 6. And it came to pass when men
[1:35:56] be to multiply upon the face of the
[1:35:58] earth, daughter were born unto them that
[1:36:00] the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[1:36:03] that they were fed and they took wives
[1:36:05] as many. And the Lord said, "My spirit
[1:36:09] will now always strive with men." Praise
[1:36:13] the Lord. Amen. My spirit will not
[1:36:17] always strive with men. And that's what
[1:36:20] mercy is doing for
[1:36:22] us is striving with
[1:36:25] us trying to get our
[1:36:29] attention. But because of the increase
[1:36:32] of wickedness and what was happening,
[1:36:35] God is saying my spirit will no longer
[1:36:38] strive with men. I've I've thrown bars
[1:36:41] in their way. I've I've thrown situation
[1:36:45] before them just to get their attention.
[1:36:49] But this
[1:36:50] time the Bible will let us know here
[1:36:54] that the imagination of men. Verse five
[1:36:58] we read for God saw that the wickedness
[1:37:01] of men was great in the earth and that
[1:37:04] every imagination of their thoughts the
[1:37:07] thoughts of their heart was only evil
[1:37:11] continuously. Praise the
[1:37:13] Lord. Amen. Their mind was so filled
[1:37:17] with wickedness and evil that in every
[1:37:21] way God tried to wave his mercy before
[1:37:24] them. They were so
[1:37:27] determined to
[1:37:30] continue their wicked
[1:37:33] hearts. And God is saying, "My spirit
[1:37:36] will no longer strive with me." Verse
[1:37:40] seven. And the Lord said, I will destroy
[1:37:42] men whom I have created from the face of
[1:37:45] the earth, both man and beasts, and
[1:37:47] creeping things, and the flowers of the
[1:37:50] earth, for it repented me that I made
[1:37:54] them. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:59] Now, see how mercy works in verse eight.
[1:38:06] But Noah found grace
[1:38:11] in the eyes of the Lord.
[1:38:15] Praise the Lord. Amen. In such a time
[1:38:18] where the imagination of men is evil and
[1:38:22] wicked and and and and that just all
[1:38:25] they want to do. That just all they want
[1:38:27] to consume their strength in
[1:38:30] wickedness to their own hurt.
[1:38:35] in such a time. Yeah, the grace of God
[1:38:39] is finding a man that's that's not a a a
[1:38:42] Noah righteousness. That's that's not uh
[1:38:45] there is nothing that he did. It was
[1:38:47] just mercy stepping
[1:38:49] in. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:52] Hallelujah.
[1:38:54] And that is the same with every one of
[1:38:56] us.
[1:38:58] There is nothing that you did or your
[1:39:00] parent did for you to have the privilege
[1:39:04] to hear God voice in this age to know
[1:39:07] that God send a message in this age. It
[1:39:11] is nothing that runs in your natural
[1:39:14] bloodline. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:39:18] It's mercy that has just walked
[1:39:21] in. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:23] I'm telling you because there are
[1:39:26] hundreds of people that could do better
[1:39:29] with this message than many of us that
[1:39:31] have heard it over and over and over
[1:39:33] again.
[1:39:36] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh,
[1:39:40] there are people young and old that are
[1:39:43] so consumed and they are burdened with
[1:39:45] the little that they know about Christ.
[1:39:48] They want to tell somebody. They little
[1:39:50] they know about they want to do
[1:39:53] something. Praise the Lord. And all that
[1:39:56] we have knowed about Christ is just to
[1:39:59] destroy destroy and
[1:40:02] condemn. Praise the Lord. Because we are
[1:40:05] the
[1:40:07] bride. We are the favorite people on
[1:40:10] earth. So all we do we just go around
[1:40:12] and condemn people.
[1:40:20] This was how Mercy walked in that age.
[1:40:24] Mercy steps in and find a farmer. A man
[1:40:28] that was a farmer. He was a
[1:40:33] gardener. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:42] And the Bible
[1:40:47] says Noah found
[1:40:50] grace in the eyes of the
[1:40:53] Lord.
[1:40:56] Hallelujah. Noah found grace in the eyes
[1:40:59] of the Lord. A man that was a gardener.
[1:41:02] God will tell him to build a boat. How
[1:41:05] will he do it? He's not a builder.
[1:41:10] God will give him a message and tell him
[1:41:13] that he will build a
[1:41:16] boat because he's going to floor the
[1:41:19] earth and he's going to destroy men that
[1:41:22] he has
[1:41:24] made because his spirit will no longer
[1:41:27] strive with them. He has given them
[1:41:29] mercy and mercy and mercy and they keep
[1:41:32] spitting in the face of mercy.
[1:41:40] Praise the
[1:41:42] Lord.
[1:41:45] Amen. The way we know how much you
[1:41:49] appreciate God's
[1:41:50] mercy is what you are
[1:41:53] doing with the grace that he has given
[1:41:56] to
[1:41:57] you. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:03] what are you doing with the grace that
[1:42:05] he gives to us every day? And God would
[1:42:08] give mo I mean Noah a message and Noah
[1:42:11] would get out there and and and starts
[1:42:13] to tell the people that there's coming a
[1:42:15] destruction. Now this God is just a god.
[1:42:18] He's not even a major in a city. He does
[1:42:20] not have a
[1:42:23] voice. Nobody will know him until he get
[1:42:26] on the stage and start telling the
[1:42:28] people about a judgment. How are they
[1:42:30] going to believe
[1:42:32] him? When they when they put his name up
[1:42:35] in Google, nothing come up about
[1:42:37] Noah. Praise the Lord. He don't have
[1:42:40] anything on
[1:42:42] Facebook. He just a poor gardener there
[1:42:46] h trying to take care of his family. But
[1:42:49] yet God gave him a message for that
[1:42:52] generation.
[1:42:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:57] When
[1:42:58] mercy walks in your
[1:43:00] life, sometimes it change your
[1:43:05] career. It change your cost of
[1:43:09] life. Praise the Lord. He don't know
[1:43:12] anything about measurement. All he knows
[1:43:14] is about menu and soil and seeds.
[1:43:18] But now God is giving him a work where
[1:43:22] he's going to
[1:43:24] measure the length, the birth, the
[1:43:26] height, the
[1:43:29] weight. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:36] Amen. That's the mercy of
[1:43:39] God. That is the mercy of God. And you
[1:43:42] see it when when when mercy steps into
[1:43:45] your life, if the grace like the Bible
[1:43:48] says, Noah found grace in the sight of
[1:43:50] the Lord. If if God can give you grace
[1:43:53] to be able to identify at that moment,
[1:43:56] I'm telling you, it can change the
[1:43:58] course of your life without your effort.
[1:44:02] God don't need your effort. He never
[1:44:05] needed your effort to bring you here. He
[1:44:07] don't need your effort to take care of
[1:44:09] you. All he needs is your
[1:44:13] acknowledgement of
[1:44:20] him. Praise the Lord. All it is is your
[1:44:31] acknowledgment. Praise the
[1:44:36] Lord. And he will go on
[1:44:41] The Bible says 120 days, 20 years he go
[1:44:45] on preaching,
[1:44:48] believing,
[1:44:50] resounding, reminding the people, being
[1:44:53] faithful to what was given to him.
[1:44:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:05] Oh, I pray that mercy will walk in for
[1:45:07] somebody this morning.
[1:45:10] Amen. I pray that mercy will walk in for
[1:45:14] somebody this
[1:45:15] morning. And he preached 120 years.
[1:45:20] I believe there were many men that tried
[1:45:22] to build boats just like uh Noah just in
[1:45:25] case. Just in
[1:45:27] case if what he's saying ever happened,
[1:45:30] I'm going to get the the fastest
[1:45:32] speeding
[1:45:36] machine. Praise the
[1:45:38] Lord. God was going to flood the word.
[1:45:41] So I don't know where you going to go.
[1:45:43] He were not just flooding one city. He
[1:45:45] was going to flood the word.
[1:45:48] It was the generation that day. Are we
[1:45:51] together?
[1:45:52] Now, there was something that blessed my
[1:45:54] heart. I like to share it with you. You
[1:45:57] know, I've I've always you you you you
[1:45:59] read that story about about Noah and you
[1:46:03] and you you hear about uh uh uh you know
[1:46:07] uh God allowing him to to to have the
[1:46:11] animals come into the ark. I've always
[1:46:14] thought in the back of my mind how how
[1:46:16] did it happen? Amen. We know that he's
[1:46:19] the God of the universe. Praise the
[1:46:21] Lord. He speaks to every creature. God
[1:46:25] speaks to every creature. Praise the
[1:46:28] Lord. He gives uh
[1:46:31] animal
[1:46:32] instincts. With that instinct that God
[1:46:35] gave the animal, they are able to hear
[1:46:38] the voice of God and run away from
[1:46:40] danger.
[1:46:43] Praise the Lord. With that instant, they
[1:46:45] have they can hear the voice of God.
[1:46:47] They can sense when when the when the
[1:46:50] weather change that they need to go down
[1:46:52] south, there's going to be snoring here.
[1:46:54] Everything is going to be white. The
[1:46:55] birds will not have food. With that
[1:46:57] instance, they can fly down into another
[1:47:01] place. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:04] Amen. But I never really thought about
[1:47:07] it this way. And uh uh
[1:47:20] uh are we
[1:47:25] together? God provide a way. Let me let
[1:47:27] me just share this with you and and and
[1:47:30] just to see how it fit right into the
[1:47:32] scripture.
[1:47:39] as it was in the days of
[1:47:42] Noah, their first
[1:47:46] thunder. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:49] Amen. If you are you, you know, you
[1:47:52] you're in you are in the word of God,
[1:47:55] the the in the scripture, the message of
[1:47:57] the hour, you know how that word thunder
[1:48:00] stands out. Brother Bam called it the
[1:48:03] first thunder.
[1:48:04] Praise the Lord. Mine. I look up there
[1:48:08] and I and I can hear the begin
[1:48:11] to scoff at him and wonder what it was.
[1:48:14] A blast went off
[1:48:17] somewhere. Let's look uh uh uh even at
[1:48:20] the animal. I can see the old mother
[1:48:22] bird sitting up in the tree. And uh now
[1:48:26] so where where where this thought is
[1:48:28] going is that if you take this thought
[1:48:31] and take it over
[1:48:33] to St. John chapter
[1:48:37] 12. Praise the Lord.
[1:48:40] Right after the resurrection of
[1:48:44] Lazarus, Jesus was there with his
[1:48:47] disciples. And the Bible says that the
[1:48:51] uh they heard what sounded like a
[1:48:54] thunder in the natural in their natural
[1:48:56] yearing. It was a thunder that rose in
[1:48:59] the heaven. Praise the Lord. And they
[1:49:01] were all guessing, oh, it's a thunder is
[1:49:03] going to rain and all of that. And Jesus
[1:49:06] told them it was because of you that
[1:49:10] sounded. Praise the Lord. Why? It was a
[1:49:13] turn to them. It also identified the
[1:49:16] voice of
[1:49:18] God. Praise the Lord. That's what I want
[1:49:21] to bring out of this. Brother Brandham
[1:49:23] is trying to let us to know that it was
[1:49:26] the thunder, the rolling of the thunder
[1:49:29] that called the animal. They heard the
[1:49:31] voice of God in the thunder.
[1:49:36] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:49:40] If those animals who hear the voice of
[1:49:43] God in the rolling of the thunder,
[1:49:45] that's a voice of God that have sounded
[1:49:47] in this day. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:49:54] Hallelujah.
[1:49:56] The sounding of the voice of God might
[1:49:58] sound like a thunder in the ears of the
[1:50:01] unbelievers. But told the seed of God,
[1:50:04] the sons and daughters of God is a voice
[1:50:07] of God that will literally change our
[1:50:10] body.
[1:50:14] Praise the Lord. They heard the first
[1:50:16] thunder. We will hear the last thunder.
[1:50:20] Glory be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:50:28] Genesis chapter 12. Let's travel a
[1:50:30] little
[1:50:38] bit. Are we together? Genesis chapter
[1:50:41] 12, the Bible, which says, "Now the Lord
[1:50:45] has said unto Abraham, get thee out of
[1:50:48] thy country, and from thy kindred, and
[1:50:50] from thy father house, unto a land that
[1:50:54] I will show
[1:50:56] thee, and I will make of thee a great
[1:51:00] nation. I will bless thee and make thy
[1:51:05] name great, and thou shall be a
[1:51:10] blessing. Praise the Lord. Did God make
[1:51:13] Abraham's name
[1:51:15] great? Oh yeah, his name is great
[1:51:20] because you cannot talk about faith
[1:51:22] without talking about Abraham.
[1:51:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. when mercy walked
[1:51:30] into his
[1:51:31] life just as a young
[1:51:34] man and mercy say get thee out of your
[1:51:37] father's
[1:51:39] house out of your kindred I will bless
[1:51:42] you I will make your name
[1:51:45] great when mercy walk into his life not
[1:51:50] even understanding what was happening
[1:51:53] but there was something that was dealing
[1:51:54] with his heart bringing him to
[1:51:57] conviction
[1:51:59] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:52:03] We have all the troubles that we have
[1:52:05] around ourself because we are trying to
[1:52:09] sort things out by
[1:52:15] ourself. Praise the
[1:52:18] Lord. Mercy stepped in his
[1:52:21] life and told him, "Get thee out. I will
[1:52:24] bless you. I will make your name great."
[1:52:27] And you will be the father of nations.
[1:52:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:35] Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] He heard the voice of God and and and uh
[1:52:43] and and I mean he was going where where
[1:52:45] is he going? He's just going. He's just
[1:52:47] obeying. Did he make mistakes in the
[1:52:51] line of obedience? Yes, he did. Was he
[1:52:54] afraid? Yes, he was afraid.
[1:52:57] Praise the Lord. In a time of farming,
[1:53:00] he went over to the land of Egypt. He
[1:53:03] fell in the hands of Aimilec that was
[1:53:06] about to destroy his
[1:53:08] wife. Glory be to
[1:53:10] God. But
[1:53:12] because he embraced
[1:53:15] mercy that walked in from the beginning,
[1:53:19] God stole for him and told Abim, give
[1:53:23] this man his wife back.
[1:53:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:29] Hallelujah. Are we
[1:53:33] together? And that same God that dealed
[1:53:37] with Abraham, he's the same God that is
[1:53:41] dealing with
[1:53:43] us. He's the same God that we have to
[1:53:46] deal with that knows everything about
[1:53:50] our life, everything that we are going
[1:53:52] through, everything that we are dealing
[1:53:54] with. that seen
[1:54:02] God. Praise the
[1:54:04] Lord. God says, "I will make you a
[1:54:08] nation. I make your name great. You will
[1:54:11] be the father of nation." And he say he
[1:54:13] don't even have a
[1:54:17] child. Glory be to God.
[1:54:21] But the Bible says Abraham
[1:54:23] never he never struggled at the promise
[1:54:26] of God. He did not fully understand it.
[1:54:29] He tried everything that he could do to
[1:54:32] to to to be right and live right and do
[1:54:35] what God
[1:54:37] says. But in his heart he
[1:54:40] believe. Praise the Lord. In his heart
[1:54:44] he believe. the God that is and the
[1:54:49] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:54:51] him.
[1:54:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:57] In his heart he
[1:55:00] believed. Glory be to
[1:55:03] God. Genesis chapter 18 the Bible would
[1:55:05] tell
[1:55:07] us at a time when it looks like
[1:55:10] everything has failed.
[1:55:13] Then mercy.
[1:55:16] While Abraham was sitting under the tree
[1:55:19] one evening, mercy mercy decided to
[1:55:23] visit him. Amen.
[1:55:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:28] In the cold of the evening, the same
[1:55:30] mercy that came down for Adam and Eve
[1:55:33] mercy took on a body.
[1:55:38] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] We have to realize
[1:55:46] people. We have to
[1:55:49] realize before we came
[1:55:53] here. I was just talking to a couple
[1:55:56] yesterday and uh uh you know talk a
[1:55:59] little bit about
[1:56:02] this. At our
[1:56:06] conception, there was a million exhales.
[1:56:11] There was a million blood cells from our
[1:56:14] father and from our
[1:56:16] mother. And with all of those egg cells
[1:56:19] and blood cells, it took two of them to
[1:56:23] meet for us to be
[1:56:27] born. The two that made
[1:56:30] us, if there was another two that will
[1:56:34] have met, you and myself, we were not
[1:56:36] going to
[1:56:39] exist. In all the million
[1:56:42] cells, million egg cells that came from
[1:56:45] our mother, million egg cells that I
[1:56:47] mean uh uh blood cells that came from
[1:56:49] our
[1:56:50] dad. It took two cells, two of those
[1:56:53] cells, the blood cells and the egg cells
[1:56:56] to meet
[1:56:58] for us to be
[1:57:00] born. The determination of which of
[1:57:04] those cells will
[1:57:07] meet. Praise the Lord. Out of the
[1:57:12] million, it just took two to meet for
[1:57:16] there to be a conception.
[1:57:19] If there was another two that met, you
[1:57:21] wouldn't have been here. You will not
[1:57:23] hear me saying this.
[1:57:28] There was a particular tool that met for
[1:57:31] you to be born. And the determination of
[1:57:34] those cells that we meet, it was not our
[1:57:39] choosing. It was his choosing.
[1:57:46] And even when they met, whether it's
[1:57:48] going to be a boy or a girl, who did the
[1:57:52] choosing?
[1:57:54] He did the choosing.
[1:57:57] Praise the Lord. Amen. He did the
[1:58:00] choosing.
[1:58:07] Hallelujah. I went to a place one day
[1:58:10] and and a lady uh my wife and and and
[1:58:13] and the children just came from the shop
[1:58:16] and and I stopped there. I didn't know.
[1:58:17] And as soon I got in the shop the you
[1:58:20] know the she's a friend of us and and
[1:58:22] she just shouted at me like that you
[1:58:24] know in a joking way. What what's wrong
[1:58:27] with you? I what did I do? You know
[1:58:31] what's wrong with
[1:58:33] you man? You cheated your
[1:58:37] wife. How your girls can resemble you
[1:58:40] like
[1:58:42] that? She caught me off gas. you know
[1:58:46] your girls resemble you too much. I told
[1:58:48] her, I said, "Look, I was actually going
[1:58:51] to be a
[1:58:53] girl, but God wanted me to
[1:59:00] preach and she just bust." She started
[1:59:03] laughing because I didn't know where the
[1:59:05] where the thing was coming from, you
[1:59:07] know. I just stopped in the shop to get
[1:59:09] some few things and I mean, she just
[1:59:11] throw it. I mean, your your girls
[1:59:13] resemble you too much. Why? I mean, she
[1:59:15] was just shouting all over the place.
[1:59:22] I told say I was going to be a pretty
[1:59:25] girl, but God had another
[1:59:29] plan. So he he he determines he make the
[1:59:34] choosing. Are we together?
[1:59:38] Amen.
[1:59:43] And if the choosing that he have made we
[1:59:47] can appreciate it.
[1:59:50] Praise the Lord. When we didn't have any
[1:59:55] contribution. Don't you think that if he
[1:59:58] choose you to be a
[2:00:01] man, he already choose who's going to be
[2:00:04] your wife?
[2:00:07] Don't you think that when you choose and
[2:00:09] design you to be your woman, he have
[2:00:11] already chosen who's going to be your
[2:00:12] husband? Praise the Lord. Are we
[2:00:16] together? And if we can appreciate the
[2:00:19] choice that he he has made, how much
[2:00:22] more about the rest of our life?
[2:00:28] Did he just choose us to be what we are
[2:00:31] for us to come here and just struggle
[2:00:33] and fight our way and you know and run
[2:00:35] into everything that we are going
[2:00:41] into. Praise the
[2:00:47] Lord. Glory be to God.
[2:00:59] Solomon will say it's in the book of
[2:01:02] Proverbs like I mentioned on Wednesday
[2:01:05] night and uh looking at looking in there
[2:01:09] for something for Mother's Day. I want
[2:01:11] to kind of talk about uh uh the feminine
[2:01:15] part of God.
[2:01:18] But God made man in his image, male and
[2:01:21] female. If that was his image, then God
[2:01:24] has a feminine
[2:01:25] part. Amen. God has a feminine part. And
[2:01:30] it's it's beautiful. If you see that,
[2:01:33] you read a book of proverb like I
[2:01:36] encourage you to read, you will see
[2:01:38] where
[2:01:39] Solomon, he takes wisdom,
[2:01:45] understanding, and
[2:01:47] instruction. He takes all of that and
[2:01:50] put it in the feminine
[2:01:53] gender. It's very beautiful if you can
[2:01:56] see
[2:01:57] it. When Solomon gave his instruction in
[2:02:00] the book of proverb, it looks like his
[2:02:03] own is speaking to his
[2:02:05] sons. My son, hear the instruction of
[2:02:08] your father, my son. He keeps speaking
[2:02:11] to his son. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:15] But when he speaks
[2:02:18] of the
[2:02:21] woman, he said, "Wisdom build her house
[2:02:25] and she took seven pillows."
[2:02:31] Are we
[2:02:33] together? So you see that is that is the
[2:02:36] thing about the God that we serve. The
[2:02:39] reality of almighty God is his design.
[2:02:45] Amen. Is his design.
[2:02:52] That is the thing that beats the
[2:02:54] evolution
[2:02:56] theory because it has to take an
[2:02:59] intelligence to get a design.
[2:03:02] You cannot get a specific design just
[2:03:05] out of chaos.
[2:03:09] Praise the Lord. Amen. It has to take
[2:03:12] intelligence to get a
[2:03:15] design. And that's the reason why every
[2:03:18] designer put their name on their on
[2:03:21] their brand and almighty God that
[2:03:23] designed us has also put his name on his
[2:03:27] brand.
[2:03:29] Hallelujah.
[2:03:31] Amen. And so we see mercy walks in for
[2:03:35] the uh
[2:03:37] uh Abraham even at an old
[2:03:41] age mercy steps
[2:03:45] in. Genesis chapter 15 Abraham told God
[2:03:50] and said I'm I'm I'm child I'm old and
[2:03:52] I'm going
[2:03:54] childish. Let me take Eleazar a faithful
[2:03:57] servant in my house and make him my son.
[2:03:59] God said no. I said by Sarah and is by
[2:04:03] Sarah.
[2:04:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:09] Because he never failed his
[2:04:14] promises.
[2:04:17] Hallelujah. Every day. Every day. Every
[2:04:21] day. Mercy works in our situation, walks
[2:04:24] in our
[2:04:26] lives. Praise the Lord.
[2:04:30] We only feel like we are defeated or we
[2:04:32] feel like things is out of order because
[2:04:35] we are not identifying. We're not
[2:04:37] hearing the sound of mercy
[2:04:40] footstep. If it was not because of the
[2:04:42] mercy of God, just like the prophet
[2:04:44] said, Jeremiah, we will have all been
[2:04:50] consumed. But if God's mercy is keeping
[2:04:54] you, it because he has a purpose.
[2:04:58] Amen. He has a
[2:05:06] purpose. Almighty God has a
[2:05:11] purpose and the purpose of God is never
[2:05:15] defeated. Praise the Lord.
[2:05:23] We look in the talking message and you
[2:05:25] see
[2:05:26] here he says when when he becomes both
[2:05:31] the judge, the jury and the attorney, he
[2:05:35] plead our case.
[2:05:38] Amen. We found guilty by his own law and
[2:05:42] he
[2:05:43] come and took the guilty person place.
[2:05:48] Amen.
[2:05:50] that was in the sanctuary. And he took
[2:05:53] his sin and and he took it upon himself
[2:05:56] and he died and paid the price and share
[2:06:00] his blood and and and and gave back his
[2:06:04] own token, his own life. He gave back
[2:06:08] his own life to us as a
[2:06:11] token. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:14] So our George became our jury and he is
[2:06:17] our lawyer, our attorney. He took our
[2:06:20] place. He took the case
[2:06:26] over. That's what mercy
[2:06:29] do. Mercy is not just an expression.
[2:06:33] Every day God's mercy takes different
[2:06:36] form in our
[2:06:39] life. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:42] Amen.
[2:06:44] It takes different form in our
[2:06:52] life. While we are pilate, the case is
[2:06:55] dismissed. There is there is there is no
[2:06:57] more sin to the believer. Oh God have
[2:07:00] mercy. If the people can see that that
[2:07:03] there is no more there is no more case.
[2:07:06] He that heareth my word and believe on
[2:07:09] him that sent me have eternal life and
[2:07:14] shall not come into the judgment but is
[2:07:16] passed from death unto life. There is
[2:07:19] the case case dismissed. No more case.
[2:07:23] Why? Because mercy stepped in. Amen.
[2:07:28] Mercy became your judge. Merc mercy
[2:07:30] became your jury. Praise the Lord.
[2:07:33] Mercedes is the one pleading on your
[2:07:35] behalf.
[2:07:42] Are we together?
[2:07:44] But yet that mercy has become a curse
[2:07:47] word in our
[2:07:49] mouth. You hear people, oh God have
[2:07:52] mercy, and they don't even know what
[2:07:54] mercy
[2:07:55] is. That if it was not for mercy, you
[2:07:58] won't even have the breath to breathe.
[2:08:03] You won't have the breath to
[2:08:05] breathe. You won't be able to lift your
[2:08:08] tongue in your
[2:08:23] mouth. Are we together?
[2:08:30] We see that all through the ages. Look
[2:08:32] at uh uh uh Exodus chapter 3. The Bible
[2:08:37] will let us to know because of the
[2:08:40] jealousy of Joseph's
[2:08:42] brothers. They were jealous over him for
[2:08:44] something that uh it was not his fault.
[2:08:50] Praise the Lord. It was not his fault.
[2:08:53] He was just being a boy, being being one
[2:08:55] of the youngest boy and and and just
[2:08:58] trying to tell tell his brothers uh uh
[2:09:01] uh you know what what was wrong. I woke
[2:09:03] up this morning. I had a
[2:09:05] dream. Praise the Lord.
[2:09:09] and and and and for some reason
[2:09:12] jealousy, you know, have just have just
[2:09:15] eaten him up and and they will destroy
[2:09:17] this boy and and and and send him down
[2:09:20] to Egypt. Sell him down to Egypt. Praise
[2:09:24] the Lord. And now they will be they will
[2:09:26] find them themselves in Egypt. There
[2:09:29] they have become
[2:09:31] slaves. Praise the Lord. Their own sin
[2:09:34] is now enslaving them. Their own
[2:09:38] jealousy and envy is now enslaving them
[2:09:41] in
[2:09:45] Egypt. How will God have mercy? I
[2:09:48] believe every day they are there when
[2:09:50] the Egyptian is whipping them. They are
[2:09:52] saying, "Oh God, have mercy. Oh God,
[2:09:54] have mercy on
[2:09:56] me." And this is the way that God will
[2:09:58] have mercy. Praise the Lord. Mercy will
[2:10:02] come to them.
[2:10:07] when a child that was born was was sent
[2:10:10] into Pharaoh Palace and he grew there as
[2:10:12] an Egyptian.
[2:10:16] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:18] And trying to deliver them by the
[2:10:20] military power. A man was killed and he
[2:10:23] ran away. That was
[2:10:25] Moses. And Moses decided, okay, I'm
[2:10:27] going to change my career. I'm I'm going
[2:10:29] to become a a sheep hoarder at the back
[2:10:32] side of the desert.
[2:10:35] But God I remember his promise.
[2:10:38] Praise the Lord. The Lord remember.
[2:10:42] Praise the Lord people. God remember.
[2:10:49] Praise the Lord. God remembers.
[2:10:54] When he remember his promise, mercy will
[2:10:57] come to them in a strange way. Moses
[2:11:00] will be at the backside of the desert
[2:11:03] and he will see a fire caught up in the
[2:11:05] bush burning. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:11:13] His scientific knowledge has kick up in
[2:11:15] his head. He want to see why the leaves
[2:11:17] are not burning. As he get
[2:11:19] close there, he will find
[2:11:22] mercy. Praise the Lord.
[2:11:26] The mercy that will deliver them from
[2:11:28] slavery will come to them in a form of a
[2:11:33] message. A word that was given to to to
[2:11:36] Moses, go and tell Pharaoh to let my
[2:11:38] people
[2:11:40] go. Praise the
[2:11:43] Lord. But did the people really believe
[2:11:46] that this was God's
[2:11:48] mercy? Amen. Why? Because they know of
[2:11:51] Moses failure. They know that he's a man
[2:11:54] that have run away. Praise the Lord.
[2:11:59] Amen. Can they can they be able to
[2:12:01] accept? Can you Can we be able to see
[2:12:04] mercy even in our
[2:12:08] failures, even in our
[2:12:11] mistakes? Praise the Lord. Because
[2:12:14] sometimes that's the reason why people
[2:12:16] just they just throw their shoulder and
[2:12:19] they just do everything that they have
[2:12:21] done because they they feel that they
[2:12:22] are a
[2:12:25] failure. Praise the Lord. They have
[2:12:28] broken God's word. They have done all of
[2:12:30] this. So for me it's it's done. I'm just
[2:12:32] going to live anyway. I wish we we all
[2:12:36] had uh uh uh the key to our life that
[2:12:40] way. Praise the Lord.
[2:12:44] Just like he's the altar and finisher of
[2:12:46] our faith is the same way he's the altar
[2:12:48] and finisher of our life. He's the one
[2:12:51] that gave her birth to breathe. He's the
[2:12:52] one that can cut it off any
[2:12:59] time. Praise the
[2:13:03] Lord. Like I said before, just like you
[2:13:06] would never be able to determine when
[2:13:08] you cross consciousness into sleep.
[2:13:13] that transition you will never get the
[2:13:16] signs of it.
[2:13:20] Praise the Lord.
[2:13:24] You never get the signs of
[2:13:32] it. Sometimes you ride on the phone
[2:13:34] talking with somebody and you hear
[2:13:35] yourself snoring.
[2:13:42] Praise the Lord. It's It happened so
[2:13:49] fast. So
[2:13:51] fast. You You don't You don't have the
[2:13:54] There is nothing you can do to control
[2:14:00] that. Praise the Lord.
[2:14:03] That is just a living
[2:14:07] evidence that you don't have control
[2:14:09] over this life that is in your
[2:14:14] body. Praise the Lord.
[2:14:18] Mercy steps in for
[2:14:20] them through a man that was a
[2:14:25] failure. Praise the Lord. Through a man
[2:14:28] that was a failure. And sometimes that
[2:14:31] is our
[2:14:32] problem. Are we able to look
[2:14:35] beyond the failure and realize that this
[2:14:39] is mercy for us? Because of our failure,
[2:14:43] we get so scared. We get so
[2:14:47] afraid. We don't want to try. We we
[2:14:50] don't want to we don't want to do
[2:14:51] anything. We just kept in that bubble of
[2:14:53] fear and we make fear our life. We
[2:14:57] interpret everything by fear.
[2:15:03] Praise the Lord. You have make your
[2:15:06] failure your hero.
[2:15:12] Glory be to
[2:15:13] God. But if we would just realize, if we
[2:15:16] would just realize if your fear could
[2:15:18] kill you, you will not live another day.
[2:15:25] I don't know if you have ever been to
[2:15:27] that place where you are so afraid you
[2:15:29] don't even want to
[2:15:33] sleep. Somehow you
[2:15:37] sleep. You wake up and then you still
[2:15:39] get
[2:15:43] afraid. Praise the
[2:15:46] Lord. Somehow you fall asleep.
[2:15:54] Is is that not a place to bounce back
[2:15:57] and say for what was I afraid of
[2:16:00] anyway? What was I afraid of? If I was
[2:16:04] going to die, I should be there when I
[2:16:06] was
[2:16:07] sleeping. But
[2:16:09] somewhere we fight our way back into
[2:16:14] fear. Praise the Lord. The thing that
[2:16:17] was not there, we start looking for it.
[2:16:23] We fight our way right back into
[2:16:32] fear. Oh, that that's a very good
[2:16:35] ingredient for the devil to abuse your
[2:16:38] mind because he's going to make every
[2:16:41] sound sound so
[2:16:45] loud. Everything will run so fast
[2:16:48] because you are afraid. Everything will
[2:16:51] run so
[2:16:52] fast. The door will slam when it's just
[2:16:56] closed in the normal way. It always
[2:16:57] closed.
[2:17:08] Praise the
[2:17:10] Lord. People, we have to believe he got
[2:17:13] it all in control.
[2:17:15] Amen. He have it all in control. And he
[2:17:20] have our lives and life situation in
[2:17:22] control.
[2:17:27] If we can just be able to listen when
[2:17:31] mercy is walking in. If we can just be
[2:17:35] able to listen when mercy is walking in.
[2:17:40] Every time mercy walks in, he gave us a
[2:17:43] second chance.
[2:17:48] To do better where we have
[2:17:51] failed. Praise the Lord. And the only
[2:17:54] way you can do better where you have
[2:17:56] failed, you have to step on your failure
[2:17:59] and go over it.
[2:18:02] You can never do better where you have
[2:18:04] failed. If if your failure if fear is
[2:18:07] standing behind before you, you got to
[2:18:10] step over it and go
[2:18:13] forward. If we can listen to the voice
[2:18:17] when mercy walks in because that same
[2:18:21] voice that walk to meet our parents in
[2:18:23] the garden of Eden is walking and
[2:18:26] calling your name every day.
[2:18:32] Every day.
[2:18:35] Mercy is walking
[2:18:38] in. He say whatever you have gone
[2:18:40] through did not consume you. It did not
[2:18:42] kill
[2:18:43] you. I'm here to make it better for you.
[2:18:49] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:53] He pleaded our
[2:18:57] case. The only thing he was guilty of
[2:19:00] was his love for you.
[2:19:03] That's the only thing he was guilty
[2:19:06] of. That was just the only thing he was
[2:19:09] guilty of. Can you imagine the kind of a
[2:19:13] life that Baraba
[2:19:16] slave? And that is the thing that has
[2:19:18] not become real to the Christian
[2:19:21] church. The conviction of why God will
[2:19:24] love us. Many of the time we attribute
[2:19:28] it to the things that we have done when
[2:19:30] it does not have anything to do with
[2:19:36] that. Praise the Lord.
[2:19:42] And we have now got to the place where
[2:19:43] that love has really affected our
[2:19:47] life. Praise the
[2:19:51] Lord. History said he never became a
[2:19:53] believer. He became a believer in his
[2:19:56] own way because he wanted to do
[2:19:59] something to pay
[2:20:02] back. Praise the Lord. He was already a
[2:20:06] violent man. So he was ready to
[2:20:10] fight because he just couldn't
[2:20:14] understand why the
[2:20:18] man will give
[2:20:21] himself will be
[2:20:23] replaced in
[2:20:28] hisstead. Are we together?
[2:20:35] Let's read Ephesians chapter 2. We'll
[2:20:37] try to close here.
[2:21:03] Paul will says in Ephesians chapter 2,
[2:21:06] you have he quickened who were dead in
[2:21:09] trespass and sin wherein in time past
[2:21:13] you walk I call into the cause of this
[2:21:15] word. I calling to the prince of the
[2:21:18] power of air, the spirit that now
[2:21:19] walketh in the children of
[2:21:22] disobedient, among whom also we all had
[2:21:26] our conversation in time past in the
[2:21:28] lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[2:21:31] desires of the flesh and the mind, and
[2:21:34] where by nature the children of wrath
[2:21:37] even as others. But God.
[2:21:43] But
[2:21:45] God. Amen.
[2:21:48] But God rich in
[2:21:50] mercy walk into our
[2:21:53] life. God rich in
[2:21:58] mercy has come down to change the course
[2:22:02] of our life. Give us a sense of decency
[2:22:06] and respect. gave us a sense of uh of of
[2:22:10] of of what life should
[2:22:14] be. But God rich in
[2:22:19] mercy. Praise the Lord.
[2:22:28] He says, "We were we were all on the the
[2:22:31] praise of the power of the air, the the
[2:22:35] the spirit that now workketh in the
[2:22:38] children of
[2:22:40] disobedience." Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:22:47] When you remember what we talked about
[2:22:49] on Messiah the prince, spiritual
[2:22:55] power, Paul is telling us that we all
[2:22:58] have the tendency to be wicked. It's in
[2:23:02] our spirit. We were born under that. We
[2:23:05] have the tendency. It's
[2:23:09] there. Unless almighty God comes and
[2:23:12] bring your conviction. Unless God comes
[2:23:14] and do a regeneration in our life, we
[2:23:17] are born under the prince of the power
[2:23:20] of the earth. The spirit that now
[2:23:22] workketh in the children of
[2:23:31] disobedience. But God rich in
[2:23:35] mercy. Mercy walks
[2:23:39] in our life one day.
[2:23:43] and took you by the
[2:23:45] hands. Praise the Lord. Mercy steps in
[2:23:49] one
[2:23:51] day. Glory be to
[2:23:58] God. And he will says there are in in
[2:24:01] the book of
[2:24:02] Colossian how he has uh he has
[2:24:06] transferred us from the kingdom of
[2:24:07] darkness to the kingdom of light.
[2:24:12] Mercy took our hands and took us from
[2:24:15] under the curses of the past. What could
[2:24:18] have become generation curse and and
[2:24:20] family curse and and and and things that
[2:24:23] run down. Mercy came and took us
[2:24:27] out. Praise the
[2:24:30] Lord. When mercy works in your life,
[2:24:33] your life can never be the same.
[2:24:36] Amen. Amen. It can remain the same if
[2:24:38] you don't recognize God's mercy.
[2:24:42] If you despise God's mercy, there's
[2:24:44] nothing left for you than for your life
[2:24:46] to be hanging on a
[2:24:59] judgment. Praise the Lord.
[2:25:02] God reach in mercy. He was says, "Look
[2:25:05] what he did. How now we can see how he
[2:25:09] promised each age a certain thing will
[2:25:12] happen. And we find out that it happened
[2:25:16] just exactly like it that he said it
[2:25:19] will because he is rich in
[2:25:23] mercy to always have mercy to fulfill
[2:25:27] his word that he have promised. Praise
[2:25:31] the Lord. Amen. It's mercy that brings
[2:25:34] us to God's provider
[2:25:36] way. It's mercy that open our eyes to
[2:25:40] make the word of God important to our
[2:25:43] life.
[2:25:45] Praise the Lord.
[2:25:47] All the people love God. They love the
[2:25:49] word. They enjoy the word. There's not a
[2:25:52] power to rise up and live what is in
[2:25:54] this word.
[2:25:56] They live on a haunting
[2:25:59] condemnation because they know that the
[2:26:01] word is truth but the power to live it
[2:26:04] is not
[2:26:06] there. The grace to be able to rise
[2:26:09] above lust, evil
[2:26:13] desires, fornication, idolatrine and all
[2:26:16] the rest of the other things. Praise the
[2:26:18] Lord. most especially now we we living
[2:26:21] in in in in such an internet
[2:26:25] age. Glory be to God. When I was
[2:26:28] thinking about the Lord gave her that I
[2:26:30] was going to talk about this morning. I
[2:26:32] was right there in Matthew chapter 5.
[2:26:34] You know if if uh just looking at that
[2:26:41] scripture Jesus says you have heard in
[2:26:45] the Lord that thou shall not commit
[2:26:48] adultery. Amen.
[2:26:51] The same one that gave the Lord he came
[2:26:54] down and say I have not come to condemn
[2:26:56] the Lord but I have come to fulfill the
[2:26:59] law. He was the lawgiver.
[2:27:03] Praise the Lord. And you just read read
[2:27:07] the context. We will get there. But he
[2:27:08] says that if a man lost in his heart,
[2:27:12] right?
[2:27:14] So you see the lawgiver was trying to
[2:27:17] make these people honor Judaism to
[2:27:19] realize you really never understood what
[2:27:22] Moses gave you. Praise the Lord. You
[2:27:26] really never understood it because the
[2:27:28] fact that is that no man can live the
[2:27:31] law of God until God change your heart.
[2:27:36] That's true.
[2:27:39] Praise the Lord. He says, "And that's
[2:27:42] the reason why I have come so I can say
[2:27:44] unto you, be perfect as your heavenly
[2:27:47] father is perfect because it would take
[2:27:50] the one that gave the Lord to live
[2:27:53] perfection in you.
[2:27:55] G.
[2:28:02] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:28:04] But this
[2:28:09] morning, I don't know where you are in
[2:28:11] your life. I don't know uh what you're
[2:28:13] dealing
[2:28:15] with
[2:28:17] but the same way I felt in my heart to
[2:28:22] appreciate when mercy walks in for me.
[2:28:26] Praise the
[2:28:27] Lord. It was just few days after my
[2:28:33] birthday. That would have
[2:28:35] been my first time to get drunk.
[2:28:39] Some friends have set a party for me and
[2:28:42] I was going to that
[2:28:45] party and mercy walks in
[2:28:50] and met me right on the road. I never
[2:28:53] forget about that. I never forget about
[2:28:57] that. Mercy walks in that
[2:29:04] evening and
[2:29:08] mercy has led
[2:29:12] me just a teenage
[2:29:19] boy. Is by his mercy that we are not
[2:29:24] consumed. Praise the Lord.
[2:29:27] And every one of us this afternoon can
[2:29:30] be able to reflect on our life. How many
[2:29:33] times mercy has walked in our
[2:29:38] life? There has been some close to death
[2:29:41] move moment in our life. Praise the
[2:29:45] Lord. There have been incidents where it
[2:29:48] could have been the end of our
[2:29:51] life. But mercy walks in.
[2:29:55] Praise the
[2:29:57] Lord. This this was just more like a
[2:29:59] reflection to me. I was dead in praying
[2:30:02] when this song came to my mind and and I
[2:30:04] just started to sing it and then I just
[2:30:06] couldn't get back to studying and
[2:30:08] preparing myself. I just I just carried
[2:30:10] carried away just to be able to
[2:30:13] appreciate when mercy works in our
[2:30:18] life. How many times
[2:30:24] Praise the
[2:30:26] Lord. To realize that we are not better
[2:30:28] than the people out there. To realize
[2:30:30] all that we know, we cannot even give
[2:30:33] account of what we have done with the
[2:30:37] grace that he has given to us. What have
[2:30:40] we done with
[2:30:43] it? What have we done with
[2:30:46] it? Are we just using it to make
[2:30:48] ourselves special?
[2:30:52] and think that we are above every other
[2:30:57] people. His grace is given to us for us
[2:31:01] to be able to carry
[2:31:03] on. For us to be able to carry on and be
[2:31:06] able to tell other people about his
[2:31:09] grace and tell people when mercy came in
[2:31:13] my life, the mercy that have changed my
[2:31:16] life can also help you. Amen.
[2:31:23] musicians, you can
[2:31:27] come another day. We'll preach today.
[2:31:31] I'm just here to
[2:31:33] testify. Amen.
[2:31:36] I'm just here to testify because you
[2:31:39] look in all
[2:31:41] ages, God has find a special way to
[2:31:45] bring mercy to his people.
[2:31:50] Praise the
[2:32:10] Lord. I don't know what's going on in
[2:32:12] your mind this morning or this afternoon
[2:32:15] and what you are thinking about.
[2:32:21] But no matter what you're dealing
[2:32:27] with, there's a man that can turn on the
[2:32:29] light.
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:32:34] No matter what you're struggling with in
[2:32:35] your
[2:32:39] life, no matter what the enemy is trying
[2:32:42] to use to abuse God's mercy in your
[2:32:50] life. You don't need to strive with
[2:32:54] God because there will be a time that he
[2:32:57] can strive no more with you. We just
[2:33:00] need to surrender.
[2:33:03] We just need to give it
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:20] in. Do you feel like that this morning?
[2:33:23] That is mercy that has rewrote your
[2:33:27] life. I don't know. I think about it all
[2:33:29] the time. Maybe I would have been dead
[2:33:31] or maybe I was going to be in prison. I
[2:33:34] don't know what was going to become of
[2:33:35] my life. If mercy never caught me at
[2:33:38] that
[2:33:41] time rewrote my life.
[2:33:51] You have
[2:33:53] fallen. My
[2:33:56] soul cast
[2:33:59] down. All
[2:34:03] mercy
[2:34:04] ruled my life.
[2:34:11] Oh, God's
[2:34:13] [Music]
[2:34:15] mercy
[2:34:16] rewrote my
[2:34:22] life. Oh,
[2:34:26] mercy rerote my life.
[2:34:33] [Music]
[2:34:37] I you have
[2:34:40] fallen. My
[2:34:42] soul cast
[2:34:45] out of
[2:34:49] mercy
[2:34:51] rero my life.
[2:34:55] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. It was your
[2:35:02] mercy that reroll my
[2:35:05] life. Let's appreciate him this
[2:35:08] morning. Oh
[2:35:12] mercy
[2:35:14] rero my life.
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:24] You are
[2:35:26] falling and my
[2:35:29] soul cast
[2:35:32] down
[2:35:35] mercy
[2:35:38] reo my life.
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:35:43] Oh, God's
[2:35:47] mercy
[2:35:49] re my
[2:35:51] life. I don't know about you this
[2:35:54] morning. Oh,
[2:35:59] mercy. Rule my life.
[2:36:04] [Music]
[2:36:10] You are
[2:36:13] falling. My soul cast
[2:36:22] down ro.
[2:36:25] You know when you think about God's
[2:36:27] mercy this way, it bring a lot of things
[2:36:29] to your mind. If you know me, if you
[2:36:32] know me, I'm not too much about talking
[2:36:36] things about my life because there is
[2:36:38] nothing much good to talk
[2:36:41] about. But just appreciating God's
[2:36:45] mercy. This will be few months before I
[2:36:48] got saved. This was in
[2:36:50] June. I got saved in
[2:36:53] October. I went to look for where my
[2:36:56] mama used to live.
[2:36:58] That was back in Liberia during the
[2:37:00] waring and then I got arrested by some
[2:37:05] men. If you look right behind my my my
[2:37:08] left ear, you will see a scar mag there
[2:37:11] and also in my
[2:37:13] head. Those guys were determined to beat
[2:37:15] me to
[2:37:17] death. They took me into a a compound
[2:37:21] that was that was desolated. Everybody
[2:37:24] has run away and and
[2:37:28] [Music]
[2:37:29] uh you know asking me different
[2:37:33] question just in my in
[2:37:37] my my innocent mind. I I just I was just
[2:37:41] talking to them, you know, just like
[2:37:43] talking to
[2:37:46] everybody. And one of the guys, he went
[2:37:49] uh he went out of the compound. He I
[2:37:52] believe he went to look for the gun, but
[2:37:53] he didn't get it. He came back. He was
[2:37:55] so
[2:37:57] mad. And then I was sitting talking with
[2:37:59] the other
[2:38:01] gentlemen. I mean, those guys
[2:38:12] [Music]
[2:38:13] uh right in the middle of my head yet.
[2:38:17] If you look
[2:38:18] [Music]
[2:38:20] here, because my back was turned and he
[2:38:23] came from my back. I mean, he hit me so
[2:38:26] hard that I pass
[2:38:31] out. I was sitting on the stairs and I
[2:38:34] did not know when I found myself on the
[2:38:36] floor, I pass
[2:38:42] out. And that's when he hit me the back
[2:38:44] of my ears.
[2:38:47] my my left
[2:38:49] ear and I slowly
[2:38:52] turned on my
[2:38:54] back and I didn't even know what was
[2:38:56] happening because I was out of faith. I
[2:38:59] was completely out of
[2:39:00] faith. And with my eyes struggling to
[2:39:04] open, I saw this individual standing
[2:39:07] right over me with, you know, it was
[2:39:09] just almost like the n the last hit and
[2:39:12] I would have been
[2:39:14] gone. I was not saved
[2:39:22] [Music]
[2:39:25] yet and mercy step in for
[2:39:31] me. The mercy of God stepped in for
[2:39:34] [Music]
[2:39:36] me. The mercy of God stepped in for me.
[2:39:48] 3 months
[2:39:51] after the
[2:39:54] Lord saved me that
[2:40:00] night. There is no
[2:40:02] way there is no way you can think about
[2:40:05] the mercy of God.
[2:40:11] And I believe uh many of you might have
[2:40:14] had a very close to death moment in
[2:40:26] mind. But like Jeremiah said, it's
[2:40:28] because of his mercy that we are not
[2:40:34] consumed. Whether by substance or
[2:40:37] whether by fire or what about what the
[2:40:40] things that could have destroyed taken
[2:40:42] our life
[2:40:54] [Music]
[2:40:57] You see why I just quote and preach
[2:40:59] because I was just I was just so
[2:41:02] consumed by these thoughts and just
[2:41:04] thinking about
[2:41:05] [Music]
[2:41:07] mercy. The many times that mercy has
[2:41:10] walked in my
[2:41:11] life and I even need it this
[2:41:16] morning. I need it this morning.
[2:41:24] You have
[2:41:25] fallen. My soul
[2:41:31] cast
[2:41:34] mercy rewrote my
[2:41:39] life. Oh God
[2:41:45] mercy rewrote my life.
[2:41:51] Oh
[2:41:54] mercy rerro my
[2:42:01] life and
[2:42:03] I you have
[2:42:06] fallen my
[2:42:08] soul cast
[2:42:11] down but
[2:42:14] mercy rero my life. Let's sing that one
[2:42:19] more time now.
[2:42:21] Oh
[2:42:24] mercy reroad my
[2:42:30] life. Oh
[2:42:34] mercy rero my life.
[2:42:43] You are
[2:42:45] falling. My
[2:42:47] soul cast
[2:42:50] down but
[2:42:53] mercy rules my
[2:42:57] life. Your grace and mercy.
