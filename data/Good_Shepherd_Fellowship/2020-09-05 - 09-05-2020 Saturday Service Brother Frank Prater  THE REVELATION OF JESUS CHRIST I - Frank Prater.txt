of the word of god so you can be seated and then we'll greet you amen revelation chapter 1 verses 1 through 6. amen it's so good to be here amen glad to have my wife with me again tonight most preachers say they know when their wife is with them they have an amen corner but we don't have to say that here i mean we have an amen corner whether she's with us or not tonight but i'm glad that she is amen will never forget um now in uh for our 38th anniversary amen the church here hosted us brother sister carlin hosted us in our our honeymoon after we'd been married 38 years that was our honeymoon and we do appreciate it revelation chapter one let's read verses one through six the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show into his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of the things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they did hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from whim which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen amen you may be seated this evening again what a lot of work you've done brother juan came in the office and he apologized he said uh i hate to greet you and this environment of the the construction not finished in the office and i said well that only means that somebody's doing something right amen so the auditorium looks great the uh the foyer looks great everything looks beautiful amen but really it's the the church is the character of the people that's in amen so it's good to see each of you tonight i'll not try to greet those everyone that i do know but i do remember the last conversation i had with sister faith and i said sister faith what are we going to do when we gather together in minneapolis or good shepherd fellowship and you're not there you remember that conversation and and she said i'll manage to be there someway so uh she's not on the keyboard but her mother is that's good but anyway it's good to see uh sister faith with you and uh and her husband uh brother jordan this is our first time meeting as it's the first time for some of you amen but nevertheless this is like home to me amen place i long to be right amen and i i joined you in service wednesday evening amen so i got to hear brother carlin speak the word of god and uh he and i seem to have a kindred spirit although i've never been white water rafting but i love i love the challenge amen i love the challenge and even though we think sometimes we should not tempt god amen but we do we do i do have three kayaks of my own you know so amen you can come down and join us sometime amen let's get right into the word of god this evening i'd uh spoke with brother juan earlier when he had invited and i said well i may speak on isaac and rebecca and uh i'm not going to do that tonight brother juan and i'm sorry if i misled you but i've been on this series of what i'm going to talk to you about tonight amen and i was as i was telling brother scott today a lot of people say brother prater calm down you're just too pentecostal uh your revelation is good but your reaction to it is just you know you you just brought too much with you i find it hard to contain what i'm happy about right i really find it hard to contain what blesses me and if any of the congregation from our local church in fort smith is viewing tonight i greet you and thank you for giving us liberty to come on this trip to enjoy these times of fellowship in the church and then to go on to the vacation that's scheduled with the carlin family and well we get to meet almost all of them again amen so it's been a long time amen in the book of revelation chapter 1 verse 1 actually describes the entire book yes now yes uh i may not be evangelistic okay i i may be more of a doctrinal preacher than than an evangelist but when we begin to look at verse 1 and we see the entire scope of the entire book of revelation now i'm reading from the notes right here in my bible not my notes but another's notes and it said this could be taken as a revelation which came from christ or as a revelation which is about christ amen but actually it's the revelation of christ himself that he's giving out in other words he's pouring himself out in revelation form now you'll understand as we get further into this tonight amen is that all prophets have to be revealed by the holy ghost is that right the prophets never say i am the prophet they never come and say amen this is me you know that's what brother branham taught he never introduced himself as malachi 4 but we believe that he is by revelation from the holy ghost it takes the holy ghost but i want you to look at verse 8 and revelation chapter 1 with me and we'll get down to this again in just a few moments this is christ introducing himself now listen to what he says about himself he said i am alpha and omega now we know what it means so i'll not spend time with that i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come now who does that describe right amen now notice the last two words of god of christ introducing himself amen to the ages right now he's introducing himself at this point he's introducing himself to seven church ages the last two words that he says about himself the almighty in other words we can say christ is saying i am the almighty amen so it's a revelation of christ that christ is giving out to himself you know abraham knew uh the lord as elohim amen which is the almighty as we find out amen it's the same way that god reveals himself in this hour so amen when we look at jesus christ throughout the book of revelation amen it is not the book of revelations all right amen the whole book itself is the revelation of jesus christ as it says in verse 1. it should not be said the revelations every bit of it is about jesus christ all right amen as as we understand brother adam said uh this is the apocalypse the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of statuary exposing it to the onlooker amen so we know that a sculptor gets excited about what he has created amen and he invites an audience to come i'm going to reveal the statue that i have created amen so that you can see my handiwork now when the sculptor gets ready to reveal the statuary he don't just walk out there and jerk a string and the whole covering come off at the same time amen in order to influence or the ones that i have seen do it this way in order to influence the excitement of his group of people that he has invited to come and see the revelation of what he has created he lets the covering off a little bit at a time is that right amen that's what the revelation of jesus christ is amen it's a little bit of him one step at a time one piece at a time amen so when brother branham is telling us it's like the same thing amen the revealing or the revelation of jesus christ is like the sculpture amen has created an image that he wants everybody to behold and in order for you to see it and to see it perfectly i'm going to reveal it to you amen just a little bit at a time i thank god for the revelation of jesus christ amen i hope that you do too when we look at amen if brother juan has me come back in the morning amen i'm going to show you that there's four things to be anyway that we need to look at as we study the book of revelation number one amen is to look at when the revelation was given number two look at why the revelation was given number three look at how the revelation was given and number four look at to whom the revelation was given when why how and for whom was it given now i've already read to you revelation chapter 1 verse 8. how many of you can agree with me amen that jesus christ is the almighty amen amen i'm glad of that it doesn't it doesn't interfere with a revelation of the godhead all right amen because we know that it's one god in three offices amen in each of those offices can communicate with the other office all right i mean so we're we're not confused about the teachings of the godhead amen but when we look at what jesus christ is saying in verse 8 i am the beginning i am alpha and omega omega the beginning and the ending amens which saith the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty amen now in our search for the revelation of jesus christ this verse will stand alone amen you need no other verses oh we're going to look at some more may i take the jacket off amen we're going to look at some more i'm a convert brother steve amen we look at some other scriptures amen but if we really want to get the true revelation of jesus christ verse 8 is enough amen to let us know the magnificent amen entity that he is he is all that we need amen in jesus christ is everything that we have need of amen all of our healing all of our saving amen everything that we have need of is in jesus christ so amen there are many scriptures that we can look at that is in conjunction with this but this verse alone tells us everything that we need to know about jesus christ amen because if we need a healer it's jesus christ if we need a savior it's jesus christ if we need a deliverer it's jesus christ if we need a provider it's jesus christ can somebody say jesus christ i mean he's all i need and this verse says it amen by revelation amen so when we look at christ in the book of revelation we want to see how he reveals himself and as we come to the conclusion amen will find out that in this book of revelation christ always reveals himself amen as the conqueror the mighty conqueror amen the conqueror of death hail and the grave the one i trust in amen never in the book of revelation will you ever find him amen being subject to death you never again see him subject to hell you never again see him subject amen to anything except himself as the almighty he is under bondage to nothing amen he is in servitude to nothing i mean he is in fear of nothing he controls it all he is the almighty [Music] oh my the one that we trust in the one we call jesus the one we call savior amen introduced himself to the church or the bride as the almighty guy amen i can rest in the end and i could go home and say jesus i know you you're the almighty amen but let's look a little further let's see how amen the revelation of jesus christ that is from jesus christ agrees with the prophets okay amen if you're going to read isaiah chapter 9 verse 6. we won't read the whole thing but if you were to read uh isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 amen this is where he says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given but he introduces isaiah says in his name the son's name amen shall be called the mighty god isaiah had a revelation right of the one that was coming was going to be the mighty god the everlasting father amen so in christ in verse 8 amen says i am the almighty he's in agreement with what isaiah said about the one that was coming as a son amen he's in perfect agreement with him and isaiah said amen he'll be called the almighty isaiah 41 4. now if i go too fast amen somebody you tell brother juan and brother want to tell me amen that i'm going too fast but i'm trying my best amen to hold my composure amen isaiah 41 41 41 4 i'm sorry amen look at what god calls himself i the lord the first and with the last amen i am he right i am the lord i am the almighty i am elohim i am the first and i am with the last. now you say well he says he's with the last amen that means there must be another there is amen there is another entity amen in the end time that's going to step up and be the perfect personification of jesus christ sorry amen in other words when we sing the song he is here hallelujah he is here amen and we're saying a revelation that he is here with the bride as he's been amen with the prophets of old now i'm getting ahead of myself isaiah 35 verses 4 and 6 or 4-6 amen god said when he would come to save or when he would come as the savior he said in verse 5 then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the death shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as in heart and the tongue tongue of the dumb sing then shall the lame man leap as a heart a lot of people don't leap anymore amen amen but if you got joy you'll leap about it right amen then shall the lame man leap as an heart amen and the tongue of the dumb shall sing for in the wilderness if you've ever been to israel and you see those little deers jumping on the tops of those mountains when it gets near those streams amen if we're in the wilderness shall waters break out what you preached about the last time you preached for me right the row on the top of the mountain amen i don't know if you believe it uh remember it or not but i certainly do amen for in the wilderness shall waters break out in the streams in the desert amen that portion of this is being fulfilled right now amen so we see uh jesus christ going back to the prophets and identifying himself with the word of god amen the prophet called him almighty then he is the almighty amen amen now you remember when the disciples were sent from john amen to ask jesus we find this in luke 7 amen beginning in verse 19. the disciples have been commissioned by john the baptist to go ask jesus some questions and i know this is uh elementary i understand that amen but it's to me it's food all right amen let's just read it luke 7 verse 19 and john calling unto him two of his disciples amen sent them to jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another amen sounds like john was getting a little discouraged right amen i didn't know it was going to go this way maybe john is saying amen but i want to make sure that i've done my job right i want to make sure that amen i've stood in my place and said the right thing amen go ask him if he's the one that i talked about or is there another to come after him verse 20 when the men were come unto him they said john the baptist has sent us under thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another and in the same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues always introducing himself amen as according to the word of god has already spoken about it amen right this is the same thing that isaiah said when your savior comes this is what he's going to do and when jesus christ is introducing himself amen to the disciples of john the baptist getting ready to begin his ministry he points them back to the word of god and to anybody that has questions he says amen this is what the word of god says go tell john amen what you see and what you hear is that right yeah amen and at the same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits unto many that were blind he gave sight i mean god introducing his ministry amen by signs and wonders and miracles then jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell john what things you have seen and heard how the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me amen jesus christ had no problems opening the word of god and identifying himself by the scriptures oh would to god amen that the bride of christ in this hour amen would come to the place that she could open this book see her name written in this book amen and say i amen am identified with jesus christ and when that happens church amen the bride is going to be out of here i think it's close don't you amen when we get to where we're going maybe tonight or in the morning we'll see amen that it might be closer than what we really believe that it could be now according to what the prophets said about jesus even in questionable times as it was with john the baptist he points them to the word of god amen can you say amen amen let me tell you something church and i'll i'll talk with your pastor again on this subject let me tell you this this book is god's word amen you say amen this book is our guide out of this world by the holy ghost it being revealed to us amen we know it is the vindicated word of god is that right amen so that any time that anybody says this book amen is wrong i questioned that statement would you if anybody would come to me and tell me amen that the apostle paul wrote in this book things that are not so i would have to say i'm going to stay with the book right if i get off the word of god you stay with that book that's right you say amen anytime you find a preacher that's off the word of god don't stay with the preacher stay with the word is that all right now i'm not up here condemning you understand that i'm just telling you amen in this trying hour that we are in amen you must have a revelation based on the word of god and that the word of god amen is what christ points back to to reveal himself if any man adds to that and tells you amen that brother branham missed the mark well i'll say then why in god's name did god put his vindication mark his signification on the ministry of brother branham if brother branham wasn't the one amen that was to come and lead us amen back to the word of god is that all right amen i always would say amen take me to the word of god amen amen so when jesus christ is wanting people to see who he is amen he never says that one or this one he says it is me i am amen in the word amen hallelujah even the unbelievers in that day are told that if they believe the scriptures amen as they pretended to do what would they do amen they would have had no problem believing that jesus christ was the messiah they said they believed they pretended that they believed they pretended that they were message believers i remember when they were confronted with the word of god and it proved that they were not who they said they were amen all right that's enough doctrine right amen you know what brother branham said and i hope this excites you how many of you believe you've got a revelation of jesus christ based on the word of god from a prophet's mouth good to see the hands going on brother brahma said the revelation of jesus christ is only given to the elect by the holy ghost oh my amen if you believe that statement amen he says this revelation of jesus christ will only be given to the elect by the holy ghost it can only be revealed by the holy ghost so if you've got this revelation correct you are the elect of god how can you sit there as quiet as you are amen when the bible says amen if you've been pointed to the word of god you are the elect [Music] glory to god i am bride of christ [Applause] that's what the prophet of god said you believe he's the prophet it's only given to the elect and that by the holy ghost what should that statement say to you and i here we are tonight assembled amen in a church that's designated around the world as a message church can you say amen and you've been invited amen maybe you were invited by one of the elders one of the members maybe the pastor maybe they invited you to be here but the invitation is not from them amen it's from the one dwelling inside of them can you say amen you've got an invitation tonight from the almighty through the holy ghost amen to be a partaker of the greatest thing that is going on on earth today amen and that is to be a part of the assembly amen of the firstborn oh hallelujah when when i consider those statements no wonder a man like me from my past amen the past i have the pastor amen i've talked to some of you about the things that i've done the things i've been involved in i mean to say that christ no longer looks at that it don't even exist in the mind of christ anymore it's absolutely moot mute to him amen that i ever done anything except serve him oh can you say amen i am the elect of god now we're not studying we're not going to study tonight or in the morning the whole book of revelation amen but we're just going to study on the revelation of jesus christ and you say well you said the whole book was but amen this one verse is enough to show us amen all christ is as we begin to break down this verse amen to show us more to show to me amen more about the church and this hour the revelation of this hour amen and how brother random brought it to us now amen i hope you understand and i'll try to share with you some of my thoughts about uh the prophet's message and brother brother juan is sometimes i used to think it was a very wise man but he didn't put a clock in the back of the auditorium amen and my clock on my computer don't work amen and brother loyal didn't pay any attention to that wednesday night so amen amen i do have a watch over there in my pocket amen but the band won't fit me soon amen you see how christ is revealing himself to his bride and it goes on to the end of the ages now you realize again isaiah understood how to study the word of god amen because he said in isaiah 28 verse 10 for precept or ordinance or command amen must must be upon precept precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line up online line up online hear a little and there a little amen amen now you remember the introduction in the introduction i talked about how brother branham talked about the sculpture amen and and what uh the sculpture that he had that agrees with that scripture just a little bit at a time amen the revelation will come it must be amen command or ordinance or oracle amen a little bit here and a little bit there but at the end of it you'll see the whole thing as clear as crystal right amen that's from the book of revelation 2. amen at the end of this book the bride of christ will come into view amen amen as i've already said when she comes into view at the end of the book amen she comes into you as christ personified on the earth amen what does it mean amen she is to be the embodiment of or a perfect example of the one that she is personifying now she'll never go to the cross again why amen because christ went once once for all amen and that's the only one that was needed that's the only trip to calvary that was needed and that's the only thing you need to have faith in amen for your salvation is faith in the blood of jesus christ nothing else will bring you salvation but she as she comes into view towards the end of the book becomes amen the perfect embodiment of jesus christ now amen again the book is introduced as the revelation of jesus christ brother brown said jesus christ is the author of this book john is the scribe but jesus christ himself authors the book amen and as he does he appoints john as the scribe amen he sees the beginning of the church and he sees the end of the ages and then he closes the book out amen leaving us with a perfect understanding of exactly who we are and where we are amen as things unfold so amen let's look at it again the the revelation of jesus christ brother random said the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages that's what all we're talking about tonight is christ revealing himself amen to the church and what he's going to do in the future ages now amen i want you to turn with me if you've got your bibles if they can put it up again amen let's go back to revelation chapter 1 verse 1. amen now remember tonight is just an introduction all right tomorrow morning is the meet all right revelation chapter one let's look at it and amen just break it down tonight and study it and amen see if we are really in the message of the hour amen not saying that that you're not but i want to give you something to stand concrete on when you amen face the devil the next time as soon as you walk out the door amen amen he begins to hound on you and beats you and amen tell you that you failed and you're no good and you're a miserable wretch amen when you walk out of here with the revelation of yourself amen being connected to jesus christ if he's the almighty i mean what's he doing for you amen what's he done for you we if we could ever church get in our grasp amen the understanding that with me amen christ there is no past amen it's only a glorious revelation of the future oh i've failed god so many times brother prater see that's you amen that's not him that's not his record of you that's your record of yourself now i'll introduce you to another thought here amen this is just table quotes all right amen you've seen the picture many times of brother branham i believe in houston you know the lilies are in front and amen then they become magnified and amen you see the licks of fire and you see the four living creatures all of that you you know the picture that i'm talking about all right amen now again we've often looked at that and that man in the back looks like and we've called it brother branham's theophany right amen now brother brown didn't say that was his theophany we have said that it was all right amen sidney jackson south africa back when brother lonnie jenkins was a young man lolly jenkins said that sidney jackson told him that brother branham said amen that man in the back was brother branham brother brown said that was his old nature hold on hey brother lonnie said that brother branham said amen that old nature was always hanging around you say amen never able to make him do anything but always able there to try to influence him amen to do that which is wrong isn't that scriptural amen when i would do good evil is present with me come on church amen remember the conversation brother branham and the old indian chief asking the question amen chief how's it been since you become a believer oh brother random there's a war inside of me i mean what do you mean amen it's like two dogs a good dog and a bad dog come on and brother brown says which one is the strongest the one that i feed the most amen is what the uh what the indian chief said i mean so if we're feeding that influence i mean if we feed it with fear and negativity and always a confession of how bad i used to be and the things that i used to do then that's the influence that we are under and we give him strength amen but if we begin to talk greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world oh hallelujah hmm i love that thought don't you amen just don't feed the old nature amen don't speak about your past don't speak amen about your failures don't speak about negative things always feed the new birth always feast on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen you get that it's not just a body word of the son of man amen brother brown said we don't feast on a man we feast on the unfailing body word of the son of man in other words amen what the son of man ministry is to do it cannot fail and what was that ministry to do introduce us to jesus christ oh hallelujah amen so we're in revelation 1 verse 1. and we begin to look at it the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him now you say well that's two in the godhead brother prater i'm not going to explain the godhead amen but we know that every revelation must come from the holy ghost amen the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him amen it's like a scriptural marriage yes right one man one woman revealing himself amen to the elect now watch again back to the first verse the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass figuratively speaking those servants amen are those whose service is used by christ in extending and advancing his cause among men amen now brother branham lets us know in order to save time and to break it down correctly brother branham lets us know amen that these servants are seven men in the book of revelation with whom god closely identifies himself now i'm not bringing you a deep revelation i know you know these things amen but i've got to say it in order to get to where i want to go yeah right we don't want to pass up the landmarks amen right amen so you say well where's where's that at brother prayer let's look at verse 4. then we'll come back to verse 1 again revelation 1 4 john to the seven churches which are in asia now we know the interpretation of it grace be unto you and peace can somebody say grace and peace grace why do we still have a message amen of anger why do we still have a message of failures why are preachers still telling the churches how bad they are yes that's right why are preachers still telling the churches amen church you've missed the mark when here we hear that there is a message of grace and peace you'll find the book closing out saying the grace of our god be with you all right you'll find habakkuk closing out the age say amen a message of grace grace [Music] oh somebody say it again praise the lord grace be unto you in peace from him which is watch him identify himself amen in verse 8 again him which is and which was and which is to come what is the message of jesus christ all about grace and peace hallelujah watch how it comes now i'm answering those four questions and from the seven spirits which are before his throne amen what is the message of the hour that we have amen from the voice of william branham amen malachi 4. amen revelation 10 7. how many of you believe those two are the same one i mean it might be a different type of ministry but it's the same man he comes under the anointing of malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers amen but under the anointing of revelation 10 7 amen he comes to clear up all the mysteries amen that's ever been uttered through the the preaching of prophets amen um revelation 10 7 amen it's not going to leave the scene until the perfect message amen of faith comes to the bride of jesus christ i don't believe he failed and i really don't believe he's coming back to complete the job i think he done well the first time amen but here now here those seven spirits are and brother brown said it's seven men with whom god closely identifies himself amen so we go back to verse 1. is this all right amen and he's let's start this the beginning the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show into his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sentenced signified it by his angel unto his servant john all right to show unto his servants amen we find out through study the message of the hour and the word of god those servants are the seven church age messengers that's right is that all right amen now always remember this you've got to discern between amen what was delivered to the denominational church and what was delivered to the bride right amen it's a message that secures the bride in her place amen and you don't have to tell my wife every day amen you are now miss prater she knows that and she's known it for amen 49 years almost right hold on amen let's look at part four unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass right you might look at this and say well he's talking about the end time 2 000 years ago and he's talking about the end time amen but you realize up until this point those disciples never knew anything about the an age of the gentiles amen as a matter of fact when john told or when jesus told them in john chapter 10 verse 16 amen other sheep i have of this fold right of the sheep i have which are not of this fold and then them also must i bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one shepherd and there shall be one fold so amen we understand that the disciples did not under the prophets in the old amen did not really see the gentile ages they didn't know anything about amen gentiles coming and they still don't if you go to israel they don't know anything amen about gentiles believing in a message of from jehovah as a matter of fact i almost got into a fight on the plane back from israel amen because an orthodox jew was standing there right beside of me next to the beside of me and we started singing on by the rivers of babylon by the shores of babylon he said where did you hear that song i said well we sing it often he said well are you a jew i said no i'm a christian he said what are you doing in israel i said i've been over here in a christian revival i mean he got mad he almost started a fight with me because i was a christian bringing a message of jesus to jerusalem they can't understand it they still don't understand it by the grace of god because if they did you and i would have no hope is that right amen so when christ is introducing himself and he's telling these disciples amen i'm going to bring you a revelation which must shortly come to pass amen to my understanding jesus christ is telling them these seven messengers are going to come and their message is going to begin shortly in other words revelation chapter 2 begins amen with an angel to the church of ephesus amen with the church of ephesus although the church has been born amen the church ages the gentile church ages start in revelation chapter 2. amen and look look at what christ is saying amen i'm revealing these things to you amen and these things will come to pass shortly amen they did not understand how graceful amen the message to the gentiles was going to be but christ is introducing himself amen i'm going to do something i'm showing you something that's going to start amen very shortly and what happens amen he begins to call out a gentile bride can you say amen amen that's you and i identified by his name amen and here we are tonight sitting amen under the greatest thing that's ever taken place on the face of the earth and he's about to finish this work up and show that this pride has held true to the word of god through the ages praise the lord i'm sorry i just believe it amen so he's about to start talking about himself but never amen in the book of revelation does he just talk about himself he also talks about his bride yes amen so now watch part 4 of verse 1 and he sent and signified it in other words it's so important amen that this revelation be properly delivered and properly understood it's so important amen that he is going to signify i mean which simply means that amen he's going to signify it or market amen as something special he's sending a special envoy amen to signify or to mark that what is about to unfold amen is absolutely glorious amen he's saying that that is going to give this prophecy a particular meaning in the next part he reverse he reveals how verse part 5 and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john now watch church one angel sent to reveal this secret to john are you with me oh what are you talking about seven messengers what are you talking about four verse four seven spirits before the throne when this winds up it's going to be one of those angels yes are you with me amen that has a special anointing amen to reveal it to john amen praise the lord are you with me amen amen amen seven spirits remember that which are before the throne the seven spirits are seven men with whom god closely identifies himself through the church ages but one angel is sent to show john the conclusion of the whole matter remember how the pillar of fire was identified amen as the same always as the same pillar of fire that was with moses amen did paul understand what that pillar of fire was when he saw it he understood that it was the pillar of fire with moses do we understand amen that what has happened in this last day is the same pillar of fire that was with paul the same pillar of fire that was with moses it hasn't changed a bit i mean it's always god's signifying amen that someone is going to do something special amen actually brother random said that pillar of fire was the covenant angel amen you see the covenant angel here in revelation chapter one verse one amen now watch it's jesus christ revealing himself and brother branham said the pillar of fire is the covenanted angel the logos that went out of god which was jesus hallelujah so now we see jesus stepping forth here just at the beginning of the seven church ages amen he says i'm going to reveal myself amen through these ages and at the conclusion i mean i'm going to choose one of those messengers and he is going to bring a conclusion amen to the whole plan of god he's going to show exactly what jesus christ wanted to show through all the ages praise the lord and brother branham said and when he died he ascended up into heaven and when it when he met saul on the road to damascus he had done turned back to the pillar of fire again amen not leaving the body there in comatose state just setting amen on the throne of mercy but amen now he comes back again as a pillar of fire with paul on the road to damascus amen beginning of the seven church ages but what will happen at the end of the church ages i mean it must be the same identification that comes and i want to tell you something i want to ask you a simple question if the minister that we claim to be the prophet to this age is not the one amen where is the one that was to come before jesus christ returns amen show me that ministry amen but i can show you where those scriptures have been fulfilled in our time oh my praise the lord thank you where has he been seen at in the last days amen it's it moved and it hasn't moved since right it hasn't anointed another man amen it hasn't come to another man amen there's been false ones there's been pictures amen that have been proven wrong but you'll never prove god's doing wrong and even though science will declare it when it happens and yet later try to say it's not what we originally said they've already said what it was no used to come along and change it why don't they just say i didn't understand it amen but it really was there praise the lord amen amen i got to go i got to run fast amen i don't want to tire you out amen remember the identification has been with the bride praise the lord now watch go back to verse one he sent him signified it by one angel to his servant john how many of you know that brother branham taught us amen that in the book of revelation when john is in relationship with his angel john represents the bride movement you're aware of that amen so go back to verse 1 and he sent and signified it by his prophet that's what that word angel means unto his servant the bride understand amen we're found in the first verse and we're also found at the end of the verse all right amen now let's look at this and see if if i can't prove what i just said by the scriptures how many of you and i heard some amens how many of you believe that that angel is a prophet how many of you believe that john in relationship to this angel is the entire bride does that mean you and i yeah amen let's see if that's true let's go to revelation chapter 19 verse 10. i'm almost done tonight amen i want to see if you come back in the morning amen revelation chapter 19 verse 10 if you've been around message preachers very long all you've already heard all this right so i'm not bringing you a revelation i mean i'm just reinforcing what's already been said revelation chapter 19 verse 10 and i fell at his feet to worship him who is this remember john i fell at his feet to worship him now john has seen something in the ministry of this man or this prophet or this angel i mean that john says why this is like god i mean this this this is like god among us and he falls down to worship and he said unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant does it say that and that thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy what would any prophet tell you to do amen but to worship god would he direct you to anything else would any god sent prophet direct you to anything in worship amen except the one true almighty god he would he would never point to himself he would never introduce himself but god through him amen would say this is what i am doing in this hour verse chapter 22 verse 8. just a little while we'll be going and i john saw these things and heard them what same thing amen we just read in revelation 19 10. and i john remember john is in relationship with an angel here so it's the bride saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me the second time now amen john comes and this is near the end of the book near the end of the ages amen second time comes around and john amen is again looking and wanting to worship the angel that's doing so many things actually it's god doing so much through the angel or through the messenger or through the prophet i mean it's god doing so much through him that john gets so carried away amen that he knows that it must be god doing this and he falls down to worship the man the second time and the second time amen he tells john verse 9 then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets now if you thought i was wrong when i introduced those seven messengers back there and amen the beginning of the sermon as prophets amen right here i am vindicated amen because john is saying amen i am of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book amen worship god i keep the sayings of this book and everything that the book tells me to do i have told you to do can you say amen i backed up on nothing i turned away from nothing everything that god declared i have said to you don't come along try to change it in this hour don't come along and try to say it's for a different day the message was no good amen it's the same god amen doing everything right down to the ages i declared everything to you that god told me to do amen that's why we can call ourselves full gospel believers is that see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant of thy brethren the prophets of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand what time brother prater back in the beginning a few moments ago you told us amen the time is short you said amen that that meant the beginning of the church ages but now amen we're over here the seventh church age messenger has come the bride is called the word is identified amen god is in our midst the presence of the holy ghost is here amen he said now the time is at hand [Music] for what the time is at hand for what amen can we read verse 17 revelation 22 17. well let's just read verse 16 also all right and if i won't say a lot about it it'll get us out of here almost as quick i jesus have sent mine an angel what does that word angel mean church prophet to testify and to use these things in the church excuse me what's he going to testify i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star right back to revelation 1 4 the messenger of the last age must preach what began must not deviate from it must stay right with it now watch verse 17. that goes off the scene the emphasis the prophet the messenger the angel is gone watch verse 17 and the spirit the same spirit now right that was doing this work over here in revelation chapter one that anointed john that anointed the angel all that amen and this the the the and the spirit and somebody say it who i'm going to say the same thing that the spirit said the spirit anointed the prophet the prophet kept the sayings of the book right amen he's bringing everything to a conclusion and the spirit and the bride saying come amen what an invitation what the bride should be saying in this hour right amen everything about the bride should say to the lost cow everything about the bride everything that she's doing she's the personification of the one that began everything that about her amen should say to the lost there is a savior to the sick there is a healer i mean to the desperate there is an answer where's it at it's in the bride of jesus christ brother branham said she is him glory come on somebody amen the personification of the greatest entity that ever walked the face of the earth and the bride is here with the same message amen the christ ever saved come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy burdened and i will give you rest did you ever hear a voice so sweet when you were in sin when you were sick when you were die did you ever hear a voice so sweet as jesus christ said come unto me and i'll give you life praise the lord you're a lucky young man brother loyal i went through the same thing you went through when i was 20 years old the doctors laid me out on a hospital bed in the south side of chicago and told my mother and my father if you've got if he's got relatives and they want to see him alive get them here within 24 hours that's right i don't know how they did it with you but they saw me so far gone and this was in 1969 that they didn't even stitch me up they just pushed me aside said within 24 hours this young man is going to be gone no way for him to live they had washed my system out nine times and found gobs of gangrene all through it are you with me amen but this young man was 20 years old a sinner and i want to tell you something and i probably have said this here before i was if i could only be as good a christian as i was a good sinner but i had made a promise to god when i was in the army in germany in the top of a guard tower on my way to mannheim germany if you've ever been there in the army you know it's a prison for soldiers that they're going to hold in germany for crimes committed and they're going to hold them there a long time but i was in that guard tower when i was 19 years old and i said god if you'll get me out of this i promise when i get home i'll change my life and he got me out of it i'm here by the grace of god amen by the miracle working power of god but brother juan when i got back to the streets of chicago as a 20 year old man i forgot my promise to god but god didn't promise god didn't forget yes god didn't forget and he knew how to get my attention you see i had been raised a pentecostal christian i had shouted and ran the owls when i was five years old and truly had an experience with god and i knew about promises made to god praise the lord so on thanksgiving night 1969 laying in my in a bed at my sister's apartment on the south side of chicago doing everything that i should not do with a infected appendix laying in bed it ruptured now watch as cold as it was they'd taken me out the door to get in the car to go to the hospital great drops of sweat running off of me they took me to a catholic hospital which refused to let me in satan knows what he's doing right now i'm not saying anything wrong with the catholic i understand that satan knows what he's doing my brother-in-law didn't know what to do he just decided he's only been out of the army since the 9th of november i'll just run him over to the south side hospital in chicago veterans hospital they tuck me in run some tests and those things go into your stomach about this big amen to find out what's going on you know amen that it's a serious situation so they push me aside they do the surgery they push me aside i side my own self in amen illegally to do so but something's got to be done the man's dying february 1 1970 i committed my life to god i want you to know something church i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now [Music] i've got something to tell you amen the bride's message is to come if you're sick come if you're a sinner come if your rebellion against god come my life was exciting the bars the dancing the flesh it was all real exciting but when god come knocking and say thank god amen for the last 50 what 50 years it's been nothing but a road amen of god coming down amen day by day and making my journey worth the walk and showing him himself out of this book and through the voice of a messenger to my age showing me and all that he wants to be to me and now i've got a message that says to you if you're desperate if you're lonely if you need a friend if you need a savior if you need a healer there is a god that is still god he's a god that still answers prayers he's interested in you he'll give to you even the very thing that your heart and soul is longing for glory amen amen i've never been tempted to turn back because i know what's there and i know what's in this amen not by my doing and not by my goodness and not by my word but by the grace of god i'm in a message of grace and a message of peace has come into my soul and god chose the elect to hear it by the holy ghost to understand the angel that was to come in this day and bring the revelation of jesus christ what is the bride's message and let him that heareth say come god can change your life and let him let his thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely or if i if i just had a little more time water of life which brother branham said is the well that rebecca was drawing from amen said she went down and drew from the waters of life and she brought it up and gave water to the camels of the message and gave the messenger a drink of the same waters of life praise the lord and whosoever will let him drink of the waters of life freely yes what happened to rebecca when she freely took of that water she was ushered into a journey amen to me and when she met isaac she met everything that her soul ever longed for though mom and dad the church and the preacher tried to hold her back amen greater was the revelation of isaac than anything else the world had on her you may be in a desperate situation tonight you may be lonely you may be lost you may be without christ you may be confused you may be searching for answers there is a god that loves you enough to come down himself in this hour and say here i am if you're thirsty yes come amen and i'll give you living waters this world has nothing to offer you that's everlasting nothing from the almighty but our
