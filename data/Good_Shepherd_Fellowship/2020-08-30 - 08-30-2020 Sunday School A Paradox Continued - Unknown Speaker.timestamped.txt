[0:00] therefore it is a paradox
[0:03] constantly it's a mystery how that god
[0:06] does that
[0:07] we look at it so much until it becomes
[0:10] so common
[0:10] we look over the top of it and that's
[0:13] what's the matter with
[0:14] we pentecostal people we have seen god
[0:17] perform so many paradoxes
[0:19] so it becomes just occasionally that we
[0:22] even think of it
[0:23] if we would only stop a minute and
[0:25] consider god
[0:26] is everywhere god is is performing in
[0:30] his old time pieces clicking right
[0:32] around till finally she'll go come out
[0:34] into eternity
[0:35] because god has promised it to do that
[0:38] now we know that there is paradox now
[0:42] back in the days of noah before the rain
[0:45] come and the flood it was quite a
[0:48] a hard thing for noah and that great
[0:51] intellectual age that he lived in
[0:53] to try to tell people by a word of god
[0:57] that it was going to rain now it would
[1:00] be
[1:01] uh no doubt that it didn't meet the the
[1:04] qualification of their scientific
[1:06] research there was
[1:08] no rain in the skies but you see
[1:11] noah said there would be rain because
[1:14] that
[1:14] god said there would be rain and noah by
[1:18] faith before the rain ever come he said
[1:20] it would be there
[1:22] that's the reason we say the same thing
[1:24] that they say
[1:25] why jesus they said he was coming a long
[1:27] time ago hundreds of years ago they
[1:28] claimed he was coming the apostles said
[1:30] so
[1:31] maybe their generation that doesn't stop
[1:33] it a bit we still know he's coming
[1:36] how's it gonna be i don't know but god
[1:38] will send him he promised
[1:40] to and i know he'll be here
[1:43] now noah could only say god said so
[1:46] but you see then after all it did not
[1:49] meet their scientific approval in that
[1:51] day
[1:52] but when the time come for the word to
[1:55] be fulfilled
[1:56] it rained just the same that was quite a
[2:00] paradox in that day
[2:01] to think that rain could come out of the
[2:03] sky where there is no rain
[2:05] but if god is stuck at his word he can
[2:08] perform a
[2:09] make a paradox he can perform a miracle
[2:12] and any man is born of that same spirit
[2:16] that performs miracles
[2:18] why it's the easy thing for him to
[2:19] believe miracles because
[2:21] he's part of god
[2:25] a son and daughter of god not by
[2:27] denomination not by a creed not by
[2:29] handshake
[2:30] but by birth that you have died to your
[2:33] own intellect and been born
[2:35] of the spirit of god and you are a
[2:37] paradox yourself
[2:38] how that you can change from death and
[2:40] for life
[2:42] how your innermost being is a new
[2:44] creation
[2:45] in christ jesus it's a paradox
[2:49] god speaks his word his children
[2:51] believes it and god
[2:53] the science cannot prove how it can be
[2:55] done they know nothing about it but the
[2:56] children believe it anyhow and then
[2:58] god performs a paradox makes it so
[3:02] makes it so because his word that spoke
[3:05] the world into existence can break
[3:07] can make every word that he ever
[3:09] promised come to pass
[3:10] that's why abraham staggered not at the
[3:13] promise of god
[3:14] through unbelief but was fully persuaded
[3:16] that he was able to perform and to keep
[3:18] what he said he would do
[3:20] he staggered not the promise of god
[3:22] being 100 years old
[3:23] and sarah 90 to have this baby because
[3:26] he know that god could perform and
[3:30] may have a paradox to happen on
[3:32] something
[3:33] a miracle to take place and he did it
[3:36] the hebrew children now how would you
[3:39] make scientists believe today
[3:42] that a man could go into a furnace or i
[3:45] would be afraid to say how many
[3:46] fahrenheit's
[3:48] hot it was but it could go into that a
[3:50] furnace back there
[3:51] in the book of daniel and stay
[3:55] in that furnace until the they thought
[3:58] that he
[3:58] was all burnt down to ashes which even
[4:01] the man the great
[4:03] uh army uh soldiers great husky man
[4:07] that moved out there to to throw them in
[4:11] the furnace
[4:12] there was a man that went in there
[4:14] perished by the intense heat
[4:16] of the furnace against them and they
[4:19] fell
[4:20] into the furnace and was down in there
[4:23] for
[4:23] all this time and come out without even
[4:26] a smell
[4:27] barrel
[4:30] god performing a miracle
[4:35] that was a genuine paradox of the
[4:38] keeping power of god
[4:40] against any enemy when a man is
[4:43] ready to admit god is true and god
[4:46] keeps his word and honors those who
[4:49] believe in him
[4:51] certainly i believe in a paradox joshua
[4:55] the great lawyer i just read about a few
[4:57] moments ago in the book of joshua the
[4:59] 10th chapter
[5:01] notice joshua was a a friend
[5:05] and a god he was a soldier
[5:08] a general and he come up under the
[5:11] influence of a prophet moses moses had
[5:15] been taken away and joshua was commanded
[5:18] to take the children into the promised
[5:20] land and to glide the lands
[5:22] the children's disobedience and moses is
[5:25] a way to be old and
[5:26] so joshua had come up to take the place
[5:29] of moses to be
[5:30] god's general and the lord spoke to him
[5:34] and said as i was with moses so i be
[5:37] with you
[5:38] that's good enough for joshua said be
[5:40] strong and very courageous
[5:42] for the lord thy god is with thee world
[5:45] our voice
[5:46] and every place the souls of your foot
[5:49] shall set
[5:50] that i have given you then footprints
[5:53] meant possession
[5:54] the whole land belonged to it was a
[5:56] promise
[5:57] way before it ever happened when he come
[6:00] down there with caleb
[6:01] and the other spies and they seen the
[6:04] great opposition
[6:05] the amalekites and and the persianites
[6:08] and
[6:08] high tides and so forth all fenced in
[6:11] and
[6:12] there jericho could run a chariot race
[6:14] on top of the
[6:15] of the place and great strong man that
[6:18] some of the uh the unbelieving among
[6:20] them said well we look like
[6:21] grasshoppers to the side of but caleb
[6:25] said in joshua
[6:26] we are more than able to take it why
[6:30] god said i have given you this land no
[6:34] matter what the opposition is
[6:36] how great and the the difficults look
[6:40] yet god said it was theirs
[6:45] oh god is able to keep what he has
[6:49] promised
[6:51] it was a paradox to see a handful of
[6:54] people
[6:54] unarmed almost for what they picked up
[6:57] on the deserts
[6:58] and where they chased other men probably
[7:00] with such as old
[7:02] rakes and sauls and whatever they get a
[7:04] hold of go in there and beat those men
[7:06] down that were giants
[7:08] it was a paradox god
[7:11] knew that they had courage to do it and
[7:14] he given the promise
[7:15] and they went in and performed exactly
[7:18] what god
[7:19] promised them to do one day in the heat
[7:21] of the battle
[7:23] when the kings had made a great covenant
[7:25] among themselves and had come down
[7:27] against
[7:28] joshua and the children of israel
[7:31] that god had promised in the land and uh
[7:34] he had routed the enemy and they were in
[7:36] the woods and hills scattered out
[7:38] through the wilderness there joshua
[7:41] looked and he seen the sun going down
[7:44] he knew if those armies got a chance to
[7:47] replace themselves
[7:48] and and come back again adding well he
[7:51] knew that he'd have twice as hard a time
[7:54] and would probably lose more man if they
[7:56] ever got a place to unite
[7:58] themselves together those were
[8:01] ministers that's where we failed that's
[8:03] where the church failed
[8:05] when this revival that we just had this
[8:07] great campaigns has started across the
[8:09] country
[8:10] when we had the enemy running we should
[8:12] kept him off the run
[8:15] but the thing of it is we have to go off
[8:16] this on tantrums and so forth and big
[8:19] sprees of building and
[8:20] making more for our groups and so forth
[8:22] and there you come and separating
[8:24] ourselves from the word and taking this
[8:26] and
[8:26] building up some more organizations and
[8:29] starting something else
[8:30] that's why it always goes that's the way
[8:32] it was in the days of luther wesley
[8:34] moody sinking fendi knox calvin all the
[8:37] way down it's been the same way
[8:39] they get their eyes off of the the
[8:41] revival and get it onto what they can do
[8:43] for themselves
[8:45] but you know what happened joshua wasn't
[8:48] that type of a man
[8:49] he needed time the sun was going down
[8:52] and he if the enemy ever built up the
[8:54] revive was almost at the end of the
[8:56] close of it like we stand today
[8:59] he knew if he ever waited until the
[9:01] enemy got a
[9:02] 45 against him it would be hard to win
[9:05] that battle
[9:06] you know what it is he know that god
[9:08] promised that land
[9:10] he needed more time so the sun was about
[9:13] to go down and he said
[9:14] son stand still
[9:16] [Applause]
[9:17] hey man a paradox indeed
[9:22] that sun stood there for a full day
[9:25] and never moved and the moon over agile
[9:27] never moved
[9:28] also because the bible said here that it
[9:31] was
[9:32] never a time before or since like it
[9:35] that god hearkened to a voice of a man
[9:40] he said oh if i know we just lived in
[9:41] that day jesus said
[9:43] in saint mark 11 24 if you say to this
[9:46] mountain be
[9:47] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[9:49] believe that what you've said will come
[9:51] to pass you
[9:52] have what you said
[9:55] still facing the paradox on down into
[9:57] our age
[9:59] sure that moon and sun
[10:02] stood still until joshua fought his way
[10:06] through with israel and advanced
[10:08] themselves
[10:08] upon their enemy why it was in the line
[10:12] of duty
[10:13] now if you go out here and say mountain
[10:15] move i'll show you i can do it it won't
[10:16] do it
[10:17] but if it's in the line of duty when
[10:19] god's commanded you to do something
[10:22] like he said to moses why cry to me
[10:25] speak to the children people days crying
[10:29] all that lord what next what next
[10:31] just speak and go forward right
[10:35] god has commissioned us to do something
[10:37] let's do it
[10:39] don't stand around and think about it
[10:40] say how can it happen well this is that
[10:42] makes any difference if god said do it
[10:44] do it anyhow
[10:46] he's still the god of miracles joshua
[10:50] it certainly was a paradox when that son
[10:53] stood still i was talking to a scientist
[10:56] in school one time
[10:58] and uh a bible teacher and he said
[11:01] i referred this to him i said i thought
[11:04] you said that the uh
[11:05] the earth turned around see
[11:09] and uh the sun stood still
[11:12] i said what about the bible you just
[11:14] tell us was the truth
[11:16] god joshua said son stand still
[11:21] well he couldn't answer that one but the
[11:23] sun did stand still didn't make any move
[11:25] you see
[11:25] that's actually the earth stop and now
[11:27] you say he said the earth stopped
[11:29] i said you said if the earth stopped it
[11:30] lost its gravitation everybody would
[11:32] fall off of it
[11:33] now what are you going to do it's a
[11:35] paradox amen
[11:37] [Applause]
[11:38] god stop the entire earth from turning
[11:42] amen because a man said stand still
[11:46] there until i fight this battle through
[11:49] that's a paradox amen
[11:52] it was a paradox when all the armies of
[11:54] israel was backed up in a corner
[11:56] and they were afraid of some great big a
[11:59] prehistoric
[12:00] like giant standing there by the name of
[12:02] goliath
[12:04] and there the armies of israel well
[12:06] trained saul
[12:07] uh head and shoulders above the rest of
[12:09] his army and shaking in these boots
[12:12] nobody was able to meet the challenge of
[12:14] this man of that day
[12:16] there come a little ruddy looking stoop
[12:18] shoulder kid up
[12:19] weighing about 90 pounds with a piece of
[12:21] sheepskin draped around him like that
[12:24] he said shame on this army of the living
[12:26] god stand here let that uncircumcised
[12:28] philistine
[12:30] defile the armies of the living god when
[12:32] the word come to saul saul
[12:34] said you're nothing but a youth and he's
[12:36] a warrior from his youth and you're
[12:38] a kid and look what he is why you
[12:40] couldn't go against him but what did he
[12:42] take
[12:43] he never took a spear he never took a
[12:45] sword but he took a sling
[12:47] shot and only one place could hit that
[12:49] giant that was right in the forehead
[12:50] where his
[12:51] armor dropped down over his face to hide
[12:53] his eyes and that
[12:55] rock at a long distance from that
[12:57] 14-foot needle
[12:59] spear he had in his hand would go all
[13:01] out as long as it was could have picked
[13:03] up a little
[13:04] david and done anything to him he hung
[13:06] him in the tree as he
[13:07] threatened to let the birds eat his
[13:09] carcass but what happened
[13:11] there was a paradox when god took a
[13:13] ruddy little man that wasn't very much
[13:15] to look at him not even a trained
[13:17] soldier just a kid that had faith in him
[13:20] and put the whole country to shame how
[13:23] did it about
[13:24] chaos and he still caught the night
[13:28] of the paradox just the same as he was
[13:30] and he put the whole
[13:32] army to ride they saw that and begin to
[13:35] run
[13:36] and take off because if they seen that
[13:38] in that little
[13:39] fellow was a faith in a god who could
[13:42] change all nature do anything he wanted
[13:44] to do
[13:44] when man would believe his word
[13:46] certainly i believe
[13:48] it was a paradox moses
[13:51] a great military man who tried to
[13:54] deliver
[13:54] israel and didn't do it he wanted to
[13:56] destroy the egyptians he destroyed one
[13:59] man
[13:59] and he got in trouble over doing it in
[14:01] his own will but then he
[14:03] took a stick an old dry
[14:07] stick off of the desert and threw a hole
[14:09] on me
[14:12] but that ain't apparent i don't know why
[14:14] when he struck that stick over the
[14:16] sea and called for the sea to close and
[14:18] he drowned
[14:19] each of a whole nation at one time by a
[14:22] stick in his hand
[14:26] it was a paradox how he led israel
[14:29] through the wilderness
[14:30] and for 40 years and when they come out
[14:32] there wasn't a feeble person among them
[14:36] that's a paradox yes sir
[14:39] what a great man it was what god did for
[14:42] him because he believed
[14:44] god it was a paradox yes sir it was a
[14:47] paradox
[14:48] when god chose one little man by the
[14:50] name of micah
[14:51] before 400 well-trained prophets of
[14:54] israel
[14:55] because this man was willing to stay
[14:58] with the word of god
[15:00] when all opposition was against him when
[15:03] the 400
[15:04] said by go on up he said to ahab
[15:08] and jehoshaphat growing up the lord is
[15:10] with you
[15:11] we just got the revelation the lord is
[15:13] with you go up you'll push them come off
[15:15] of our land because it's ours
[15:18] god gave it to us joshua divided up the
[15:20] lands and this belongs to us and there's
[15:22] the philistines up there
[15:24] eating corn off of our fields why it's
[15:26] no more than reason
[15:27] our revelation is right then how god
[15:30] chose a little man like micah
[15:32] that couldn't even get into the
[15:34] association but he come up there with
[15:36] the word of the lord
[15:37] and he said why but i seen israel
[15:40] scattered like sheep having no shepherd
[15:42] there was a paradox how god would stand
[15:44] a little bitty
[15:46] unnoticed fella out there in the midst
[15:48] of a whole great big 400
[15:50] group of prophets of israelite prophets
[15:53] jewish prophets
[15:54] standing there prophesying falsely how
[15:57] did micah know he was right because he
[15:59] was right with the word
[16:01] elijah said the same thing would happen
[16:03] how could he bless what god had cursed
[16:06] it was a paradox but god made it come to
[16:08] pass
[16:09] certainly one is a paradox when a little
[16:12] bitty
[16:13] looking boy with seven little
[16:15] locks of hair hanging down his head
[16:17] maybe a bull ribbon in it for all i know
[16:20] like a little bitty his name was
[16:22] samson and when a line about a 500 pound
[16:25] maybe lying rory
[16:26] come against him and he took his hands
[16:28] and tore it out apart
[16:31] man watch what happened to the spirit of
[16:34] the lord come on in first that's what
[16:36] causes the paradise
[16:38] that's what a paradox like that would
[16:40] set this arena of fire tonight for the
[16:42] glory of god
[16:43] if the lord can be permitted to come
[16:46] upon the people a paradox indeed
[16:52] yes when samson slew that line with his
[16:56] bare hands
[16:56] pulled him apart a little bitty
[17:00] sort of a boy with seven little locks of
[17:01] hair hanging down his back
[17:03] he was a paradox when he took the
[17:05] jawbone of that mule
[17:07] and beat in a thousand philistines heads
[17:10] when that big helmets the big coats of
[17:13] nail on
[17:14] brass weighing probably 100 pounds or
[17:16] close to it
[17:17] big shields and so forth spears
[17:19] well-trained man
[17:21] and a helmet about an inch and a half
[17:22] thick out of brass come down and turn up
[17:24] just their faces
[17:25] and sampson stood there with this
[17:27] jawbone of the mule
[17:28] been laying out there maybe for 40 50
[17:31] years
[17:33] on the desert dry or one lick against a
[17:36] piece of steel like that would have
[17:37] shattered it into a million pieces
[17:39] but he stood there that's the only thing
[17:42] he was commissioned to
[17:43] fight and to take that country out he
[17:46] was raised up and born
[17:47] to save that nation
[17:49] [Applause]
[17:55] the pentecostal church could only
[17:57] realize what you're here for
[17:59] what's your representation why did you
[18:01] come out of these things to be what you
[18:03] are
[18:03] yeah you what he was born for he knew
[18:07] where he stood
[18:08] the thing he had his hand made no
[18:09] difference he stood there
[18:11] and as those philistines come and that
[18:13] powerful liquor that little shrimp
[18:15] standing up on a rock to reach top of
[18:17] their heads
[18:17] when they're afraid to knock one more
[18:19] and one the other and they laid a
[18:20] thousand of them laying dead in there
[18:23] it was a paradox how that used jaw held
[18:25] together it was a paradox how that
[18:27] little piece of brittle bone
[18:29] would break through those instinct
[18:31] helmets of breast and slay those
[18:33] philistines a thousand of men he still
[18:34] stood there within his hand
[18:36] just as good as it was when he picked it
[18:37] up it was a paradox
[18:42] still the same yesterday today and
[18:44] forever he's still the same
[18:47] amen has been called to take the word of
[18:49] god
[18:50] god will stand by if he don't be a
[18:52] coward samson could have run but he
[18:54] didn't do it
[18:55] ryan it was a paradox when god called
[18:59] john the baptist the son of a priest out
[19:02] of a great school of priests
[19:04] a great seminary why didn't that which
[19:06] it was customary
[19:07] that man followed the tradition of their
[19:09] fathers why it was a paradox when god
[19:11] took john to the wilderness
[19:13] to tell him what the messiah would be to
[19:15] tell him what the sign of the messiah
[19:17] would be
[19:18] how he would know it instead of going to
[19:20] school to learn
[19:21] what the messiah would be god took him
[19:23] to the wilderness to tell him what the
[19:24] messiah would be
[19:26] it was quite a paradox of them people in
[19:28] that day
[19:29] yes when the virgin birth came on
[19:32] that was a paradox how that god
[19:36] and order to make himself known
[19:40] to man became man how the
[19:43] god the great spirit god to me
[19:47] was before there was even a light there
[19:50] wasn't a meter there wasn't a
[19:52] atom there was a molecule there there
[19:55] wasn't anything
[19:56] and everything was god yes that's how
[20:00] great he is he's from
[20:01] eternity through eternity he always was
[20:04] god he always will be god
[20:06] and how the greatest of all life become
[20:09] a little small
[20:11] a germ in the womb of a woman in order
[20:14] to
[20:14] take his own law to pay the penalty of
[20:18] his law
[20:18] death how god was manifested in the
[20:21] flesh
[20:22] how the great god of heaven changed his
[20:25] strain
[20:26] come from being god to be man through
[20:28] the virgin birth
[20:30] nobody can figure it out science today
[20:32] can't tell you how that virgin
[20:34] birth was but god did it he came
[20:37] no one was able everyone was sexually
[20:39] born
[20:40] like the red one man is the same as the
[20:42] aston no one could help the other ways
[20:44] all in trouble
[20:44] and then god himself came down
[20:48] and was born not of a jew not of a
[20:50] gentile but his blood was god
[20:52] blood comes from the male set in this
[20:55] case
[20:55] it was god god the creator created the
[20:58] blood cell
[20:59] in the womb of mary and build himself a
[21:01] tabernacle at himself come down and
[21:03] lived in it
[21:04] god was in christ reconciling the world
[21:07] the very word christ means the anointed
[21:10] one
[21:12] god in his tallest dwelt in him amen and
[21:15] him throughout the fullness of the
[21:16] godhead bodily
[21:18] that was a paradox it staggered people
[21:20] that made you be a man make yourself god
[21:22] it still doesn't
[21:24] but just the same is still the same
[21:26] paradoxes carried on he was god
[21:28] you still god he always will be god
[21:32] yes sir he's the same yesterday today
[21:35] and forever yes sir that virgin birth
[21:38] was a mystery to the people they
[21:40] couldn't understand it
[21:41] just like the new birth is today the new
[21:44] birth is a mystery to the people they
[21:45] can't understand it
[21:46] they don't know what you mean they have
[21:48] belittled it
[21:49] bring it down saying but just because
[21:51] you believe something the devils believe
[21:53] the same thing and tremble
[21:55] it isn't what you believe it's what god
[21:57] has actually done
[21:59] a new birth is a birth it was a new it
[22:02] was a paradox
[22:03] when god brought new life to the human
[22:06] race
[22:06] to rejected his eternal separation to
[22:09] receive in his eternal life you have
[22:12] you're on the same basis that adam and
[22:14] eve was you can take
[22:16] if god put you on anything else it would
[22:18] be unjust to adam and eve
[22:20] each adam and eve tonight's got the
[22:22] right and wrong standing before him you
[22:23] can make your choice
[22:25] you can take god's word or leave god's
[22:27] word you can take god's word or take
[22:29] your denominational creeds about it
[22:32] take your modernistic ideas of what it
[22:34] is you can be born again and fill with
[22:36] the holy ghost or you can be
[22:37] church eyes either one you want to be
[22:39] for me to live
[22:40] is christ hallelujah i believe that that
[22:43] same
[22:44] god that fell on the day of pentecost
[22:46] upon his church
[22:47] as a pillar of fire and divided himself
[22:49] with cloven tongues among his people
[22:51] his chair tonight is the same god he was
[22:53] then he is today
[22:55] [Music]
[22:56] i know it's a paradox it cannot be
[22:58] explained emotion screaming crying
[23:01] and so forth cannot be explained but
[23:03] it's a paradox how god does it's the
[23:05] unseen
[23:06] god dwelling in the human heart making
[23:08] yourself visible by vindicating his word
[23:11] that he's the same yesterday today and
[23:12] forever
[23:14] is a paradox on a carpenter's son
[23:17] by the name of jesus of nazareth tuck up
[23:21] five little biscuits and two fish and
[23:23] fed 5 000 people
[23:25] if it is and i want to see somebody do
[23:26] it today i want you to explain to me
[23:29] what kind of an atom he let loose
[23:31] what did he do not only the fish but the
[23:33] fishes growed
[23:34] the fish was scaled the fish was clean
[23:36] the fish was cooked the fish was
[23:38] whatever it was and the bread was
[23:40] planted and grown and
[23:42] all of it bypassed and god turned it
[23:45] from
[23:46] from cooked fish to cook fish he just
[23:49] grown it out they broke it off they
[23:51] throw it out they broke it off they
[23:52] throw it out until they fed
[23:53] 5 000 what does that routine mean
[23:57] break it off grow it out break it off
[24:00] throw it out feed it throw it out
[24:02] that means he's the same yesterday today
[24:04] forever
[24:06] [Music]
[24:07] he's still the better life to any man
[24:14] you can't exhaust his goodness
[24:18] they say we have no need for miracles no
[24:20] need for paradox
[24:22] he's waiting that's his program that's
[24:25] what he is
[24:26] he's the same yesterday forever he's
[24:28] waiting for you to reach up
[24:30] and take your potion are you scared to
[24:33] do it
[24:33] would you rather go down to the river
[24:35] and fish out a fish and try to cook and
[24:36] fry in some kind of hoglar
[24:38] or something or you don't take it the
[24:40] way god has just preached about faith
[24:42] and say jesus the same yesterday forever
[24:45] i clean lord i believe in you place
[24:47] within me the food the strength the
[24:49] faith that i need
[24:51] watch to see what happens with the
[24:52] sincere heart he'll satisfy
[24:54] every hunger he'll do it jesus was a
[24:58] mayor had a paradox when he fed 5 000
[25:01] people
[25:01] of five fish and and then taking up two
[25:04] basketballs or
[25:05] several basketballs afterwards it was a
[25:07] paradox
[25:08] when a man with feet like i got in yugo
[25:12] [Music]
[25:13] a lake like lake michigan out here
[25:17] when the storms is on and the white caps
[25:20] probably
[25:20] if you was ever there and see how the
[25:22] storms come down they do it yet
[25:24] across galilee there and it almost
[25:26] looked like bail upon the ocean drive
[25:29] when that comes down through them winds
[25:31] terribly and begins to sweep and the
[25:33] white caps pitch that boat
[25:35] until all hopes is gone and upon that
[25:38] sea where they had been roaring from
[25:41] ordering from along about
[25:43] four o'clock in the afternoon i'd say
[25:45] until the last the
[25:46] fourth watch along three or four o'clock
[25:48] in the morning how far had they rolled
[25:50] across the seat
[25:52] and they left him on the other side
[25:55] amen at the fourth watch here he
[25:58] come walking up on the waves
[26:02] that was a paradox how could he make
[26:04] himself light enough
[26:06] how could he step on the waves and step
[26:08] from one wave to the other those big
[26:10] waves coming he go right up over one
[26:12] right down in the other right up over
[26:14] the line without a drop of water on him
[26:16] come walking all the way explaining it
[26:18] to me
[26:21] what was it it was a paradox absolutely
[26:24] it was a paradox when peter who he had
[26:27] never seen in his life
[26:29] his name was simon walked up in the
[26:31] presence of jesus christ
[26:33] because his brother andrew had told him
[26:35] he was the messiah
[26:37] and when jesus looked that man in the
[26:40] face for the first time that he had ever
[26:42] seen him
[26:43] and said your name is simon and you are
[26:46] the son of jonas
[26:50] that's a paradox if it isn't
[26:53] tell me how you did it it was
[26:56] a paradox why because he
[26:59] is the word and the bible said the word
[27:02] of god
[27:03] is sharper than a 2 8 sword and a
[27:05] deserter of the thoughts and intents of
[27:07] the heart
[27:08] that prove that he was the word amen
[27:12] the same yesterday and forever
[27:22] [Music]
[27:32] [Music]
[27:56] you
